    "plain_text": "# SolarWinds says fewer than 100 customers were impacted by supply chain attack\n\n**[therecord.media/solarwinds-says-fewer-than-100-customers-were-impacted-by-supply-chain-attack](https://therecord.media/solarwinds-says-fewer-than-100-customers-were-impacted-by-supply-chain-attack)**\n\nMay 8, 2021\n\nTexas-based software firm SolarWinds downgraded the number of customers impacted by its\n2020 supply chain attack from 18,000 to less than 100.\n\nIn an [SEC filing on Friday, the company said that based on new information surfaced during](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1739942/000173994221000076/swi-20210507.htm)\nits investigation, such as DNS traffic records, it now believes that while 18,000 of its 300,000\ncustomers downloaded a version of its Orion software that was tainted with the Sunburst\nmalware, the attackers activated the malware only on a handful of customers networks.\n\nWe now estimate that the actual number of customers who were hacked through\nSUNBURST to be fewer than 100. […] This information is consistent with estimates\nprovided by U.S. government entities and other researchers and consistent with the\npresumption the attack was highly targeted.\n\n_SolarWinds CEO Sudhakar Ramakrishna_\n\nSolarWinds said that while it detected around 18,000 downloads of the tainted SolarWinds\nOrion app, many customers did not install the downloaded version, or the Orion update was\ninstalled in air-gapped networks where the malware couldn’t connect to its command-andcontrol server, blocking any future attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe company s CEO Sudhakar Ramakrishna said the company issued this update to correct\nmedia reports from last year that incorrectly suggested that 18,000 of its customers were\nhacked when, in reality, the attackers only went after a handful of selected targets, such as\nlarge companies and government organizations.\n\nThis was confirmed last month by the governments of several countries, including the Biden\nadministration, who formally accused the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) of\norchestrating the SolarWinds supply chain attack as part of a targeted cyber-espionage\ncampaign.\n\n## Investigation into the hacker’s entry point is progressing\n\nBut the SEC document filed on Friday also provided additional insight into the company’s\ninternal investigation. One of the biggest mysteries that remains to be solved is how SVR\nhackers gained access to SolarWinds’ internal network in the first place.\n\nThe Texas software company said it is still investigating this topic and has, in the meantime,\nnarrowed down the entry point to three possibilities:\n\nZero-day vulnerability in a third-party application or device;\nBrute-force attack, such as a password spray attack; or\nSocial engineering, such as a targeted phishing attack.\n\nSolarWinds also said that while they “don’t know precisely when or how the threat actor first\ngained access to [their] environment,” the company found new evidence that the threat actor\ncompromised internal credentials and moved around its internal network and Microsoft Office\n365 environment for at least nine months prior to initiating a so-called test run in October\n2019, when they tested their ability to deploy malicious code inside the SolarWinds Orion\napp before launching the actual attack in March 2020.\n\nIn addition, SolarWinds said the SVR hackers also:\n\nThe threat actor created and moved files that we believe contained source code for\nboth Orion Platform software and non-Orion products. However, we are unable to\ndetermine the actual contents of those files.\nThe threat actor created and moved additional files, including a file that may have\ncontained data supporting our customer portal application. Although we’re unable to\ndetermine the actual contents of the files, the information included in our customer\nportal databases does not contain highly sensitive personal information, such as credit\ncard, Social Security, passport details, or bank account numbers, but contains other\ninformation such as customer name, email addresses, billing addresses, encrypted\nportal login credentials, IP addresses downloading any software and MAC addresses\nof the registered Orion servers.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe threat actor accessed email accounts of certain personnel, some of which\ncontained information related to current or former employees and customers. We are\ncurrently in the process of identifying all personal information contained in the emails of\nthese accounts and expect to provide notices to any impacted individuals and other\nparties as appropriate.\nThe threat actor moved files to a jump server, which we believe was intended to\nfacilitate exfiltration of the files out of our environment.\n\nSolarWinds said that it is still investigating the attack and its aftermath. The company is\nworking with KPMG and CrowdStrike, and several government agencies.\n\n[Last month, the company revoked and issued a new digital code-signing certificate for its](https://www.solarwinds.com/sa-overview/new-digital-certificate)\napplications and also revamped its software build process to add post-build verification\ndefenses.\n\nImage: SolarWinds LLC\nTags\n\n[APT29](https://therecord.media/tag/apt29/)\n[Russia](https://therecord.media/tag/russia/)\n[SEC](https://therecord.media/tag/sec/)\n[SolarWinds](https://therecord.media/tag/solarwinds/)\n[supply chain attack](https://therecord.media/tag/supply-chain-attack/)\n[SVR](https://therecord.media/tag/svr/)\n\n\n-----\n\nCatalin Cimpanu is a cybersecurity reporter for The Record.
