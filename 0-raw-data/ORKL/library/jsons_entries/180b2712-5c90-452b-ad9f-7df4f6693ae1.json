[https://t.co/pr5jq08fPx](https://t.co/pr5jq08fPx)\n\n## Discussion\n\n\n-----\n\nSome feedback on the content of this article: \"MBED TLS is an implementation of the\nTLS and SSL protocols distributed under the Apache License. Apache is a widely used\nweb server software that runs on the Linux platform.\" MBED TLS uses the Apache\nlicense, but the Apache web server software is not involved in this vulnerability. MBED\nTLS is commonly used by IoT and ARM devices. VMware ESXi also makes use of the\nMBED TLS library. VMware released patches back in March for the vulnerabilities.\nPeople who have not patched their ESXi hosts recently are the ones who should be\nmade aware of the issue. \"VMware ESXi, formerly known as ESX, is a bare metal\nhypervisor...\" This is an incorrect comparison. It's like saying Windows 10 is formerly\nknown at Windows 95. While they're both Windows, they're also entirely different\nproducts. ESXi is not directly derived from ESX. ESX loaded a linux kernel and then\nadded drivers to support virtualization whereas ESXi does not use a linux kernel at all,\nbut rather uses a proprietary VMware developed kernel. As such, a vulnerability which\nexploits a weakness of linux is unlikely to be able to exploit ESXi. I also wouldn't\nsuggest a hypervisor partitions a server into VMs. A hypervisor allows multiple guest\noperating systems to share the physical resources of the underlying host. Partitioning\ntypically implies dividing resources, but not sharing them. So what's really going on\nhere is that ESXi and Linux-based NASes are being targeting, possibly leveraging\nvulnerabilities in the MBED TLS library. It is very much a mistake to call ESXi a linuxbased system as it does not use the linux kernel. It's similar to suggesting FreeBSD is\na linux distribution. Declare that on the internet at your own peril. It's ashame the article\ndidn't suggest corrective action. \"REvil is doing bad stuff, patch your NAS and ESXi\nhosts!\"\n\n## Subscribe to our newsletter, Threatpost Today!\n\nGet the latest breaking news delivered daily to your inbox.\n\nSubscribe now\n\n\n-----",
