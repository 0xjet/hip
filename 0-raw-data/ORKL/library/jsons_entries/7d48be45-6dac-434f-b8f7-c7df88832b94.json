    "plain_text": "# Russian Cyber Attack Campaigns and Actors\n\n**[ironnet.com/blog/russian-cyber-attack-campaigns-and-actors](https://ironnet.com/blog/russian-cyber-attack-campaigns-and-actors/)**\n\nMay 29, 2020\n\nSome of the most notorious actors in the cyber threat landscape have been traced back to\nsponsorship by the Russian state. As the digital revolution has accelerated, so, too, has the\nRussian cyber attack landscape — hold-over Cold War tactics that evolved to take advantage of\nnew electronic methods of communication.\n\nStrategic Russian interests are guided by the desires for Russia to be recognized as a great\npower, to protect the Russian identity, and to limit global United States power. These themes are\nevident in components commonly associated with Russian-backed cyber threat campaigns:\n\nThe weaponization of information through disinformation campaigns and propaganda\nAttempted interference in democratic processes\nStrategic positioning within critical infrastructure, perhaps as preparation for potential\nescalation of hostilities with rival nations.\n\nTo summarize the threat at a more tactical level, we have scoured cybersecurity reporting in order\nto prepare an overview of cyber threat actors observed more recently, and to which evidencebased analysis has assigned the likelihood of Russian state-sponsorship as probable. Each actor\nis presented with highlights of more notable campaign activity, with notations on countries and\nsectors targeted, as well as a mention of behaviors or tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)\nutilized in order to enable actions on objectives. Footnotes provide links to further, more detailed,\nreading.\n\n\n-----\n\nWho are today’s major Russian adversary groups and what are the main tactics and techniques\nof Russian cyber attack campaigns? Let’s take a closer look at some of these known actors, listed\nhere in order of threat scope and potential:\n\n## Sandworm Team\n\nActive since at least 2009, the Sandworm Team is responsible for the first publicly acknowledged\ncyber incident that resulted in power outages impacting a civilian population, occurring in Ukraine\nin December 2015. The malware used in this attack, BlackEnergy 3, enabled the actor to gain\naccess to the IT network of a Ukrainian power company, from which they pivoted to the SCADA\nportion of the network, giving the actor the ability to manipulate the Industrial Control System\n(ICS) — without the need for customized malware — in order to shut down power in Kiev. This is\nan often mis-characterized component of the campaign, likely because the BlackEnergy 2\npredecessor to BlackEnergy 3 contained ICS targeting components that are not present in\n[BlackEnergy 3. Cybersecurity researchers also note that “Russian operators, such as Sandworm](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/12/attackers-deploy-new-ics-attack-framework-triton.html)\nTeam, have compromised Western ICS over a multi-year period without causing a disruption,”\nperhaps in order to stage for future potential Russian cyber attack campaigns.\n\n\n### Known Targets\n\n Sample TTPs\n\n Also Known As\n\n\n### NATO member countries, Ukraine, Telecommunications, Energy, Gov‐ ernment, Education\n\n Spearphishing utilizing weaponized Microsoft Office documents Denial of Service attacks for the purposes of disrupting communications Remotely controlling SCADA Destruction of files by utilizing KillDisk malware\n\n BlackEnergy, Voodoo Bear, TEMP.Noble, Iron Viking\n\n\n## ELECTRUM\n\n[This group is responsible for the CRASHOVERRIDE malware framework (frequently also referred](https://www.recordedfuture.com/crashoverride-malware-overview/)\nto as Industroyer), which was the first malware to ever specifically target and disrupt electric grid\noperations. In December 2016, Russian cyber attack by these actors manipulated breakers at a\nsubstation in Kiev Ukraine, leading to power disruption and serious damage to equipment.\n\n[ELECTRUM has links to Sandworm as their development group, but it appears that the](https://www.dragos.com/wp-content/uploads/2017-Review-Industrial-Control-System-Threats.pdf)\nunderstanding of which team actually carried out the attack has evolved over time. Regardless of\nthe specific threat actor, the behaviors demonstrated are what are important to understand.\n\n\n### Known Tar‐ gets\n\n\n### Ukrainian energy sector\n\n\n-----\n\n### Sam‐ ple TTPs\n\n Also Known As\n\n\n### Maliciously impacting operations by leveraging ICS protocols Establishment of an internal proxy within a compromised network which receives connections from backdoors installed on other systems within the network, and attempts to funnel data to external command and con‐ trol servers Incorporation of malware modules with data wiping capabilities\n\n Sandworm Team\n\n\n## Telebots\n\n[Telebots is the group attributed to the NotPetya ransomware outbreak, which is the most](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/10/11/new-telebots-backdoor-linking-industroyer-notpetya/)\ndestructive attack in history from a financial perspective, and is reported to be an evolution of the\ngroup or groups responsible for causing the Ukrainian blackouts described in the previous two\nsections. In 2018, the security firm ESET identified code linkages between NotPetya and\nCRASHOVERRIDE (which they refer to as the Industroyer attack). The NotPetya attack initially\ntargeted industries in Ukraine after the threat actor was able to effect a supply-chain compromise\nof Ukrainian accounting software. The incorporation of the EternalBlue exploit for SMB in\nconjunction with the password dumping tool Mimikatz enabled NotPetya to cripple networks\naround the globe.\n\n\n### Known Targets\n\n Sample TTPs\n\n Also Known As\n\n\n### Ukrainian financial sector\n\n Spearphishing with Microsoft Excel attachments containing malicious macros Hiding malicious network activity by abusing legitimate services to host payloads or provide communication mediums for attackers Deployingredundant backdoors within a network Disguising malware backdoors by providing them with names resem‐ bling AV-related services\n\n Sandworm Team\n\n\n## Energetic Bear\n\nThis group is assessed as the creator of the Havex RAT, which is one of five known ICS tailored\nmalware families. Energetic Bear campaigns began in 2010 in order to collect intelligence used\nfor espionage (as opposed to attempting destruction or disruption of systems) and have continued\nthrough at least 2017. The TTPs leveraged by this threat actor are not unique or particularly\nnovel, but the systematic and deliberate social engineering strategies employed are. Smaller, less\n\n\n-----\n\ndefended companies and subcontractors within the energy sector have been targeted — likely as\n[a means for the actor, in turn, to target regional and national-level energy companies and power](https://www.wsj.com/articles/americas-electric-grid-has-a-vulnerable-back-doorand-russia-walked-through-it-11547137112)\nsuppliers.\n\n\n### Known Tar‐ gets\n\n Sam‐ ple TTPs\n\n Also Known As\n\n\n### Energy, Aviation, Pharmaceutical, Defense, Petrochemical sectors in the United States and Europe\n\n Compromise legitimate industrial control systems vendor sites and plant trojanized versions of ICS-related software and applications on those sites Spearphishing emails with PDF attachments embedded with Adobe Flash exploits\n\n Dragonfly, Crouching Yeti, Havex, Koala, Iron Liberty\n\n\n## DYMALLOY\n\nSome researchers attribute the activities of this group to an evolution of Energetic Bear activity\n(referring to earlier activity as Dragonfly and later activity as Dragonfly 2.0); however, Dragos\nasserts that there are enough technical differences to justify tracking this as a separate group.\nThis group avoids using custom malware, opting for commodity malware families that hinder\n[attempts at applying attribution. Crowdstrike reports that this group has strong ties to Moscow, as](https://www.crowdstrike.com/wp-content/brochures/falcon-intel/FalconIntelDatasheetMay2016.pdf)\ntargeting aligns closely with likely collection priorities of Russian intelligence.\n\n### Known Targets Industrial Control Systems in Turkey, Europe, and the United States\n\n Sample TTPs Use of commodity malware such as Goodor, DorShel, and Karagany\n\n\n### Also Known As\n\n## APT29\n\n\n### Dragonfly 2.0, Berserk Bear\n\n\nThis group has operated since at least 2008, collecting intelligence in support of foreign and\nsecurity policy decision-making. The primary targets are Western governments and related\n[organizations, but intrusion attempts have been witnessed across a broad spectrum of sectors.](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2018/11/not-so-cozy-an-uncomfortable-examination-of-a-suspected-apt29-phishing-campaign.html)\nNotable compromises include the intrusion into the Democratic National Committee in 2015 and\n2016, and intrusions into unclassified networks of a variety of U.S. government departments.\n\n\n### Known Tar‐ gets\n\n\n### Western governments and related organizations, as well as Western Europe, Brazil, China, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, South Korea, Turkey, and Cen‐ tral Asian countries.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Sam‐ ple TTPs\n\n Also Known As\n\n## APT28\n\n\n### Heavy waves of spearphishing with messages that contain either links to malicious executables hosted on legitimate but compromised web‐ sites, or Microsoft Office attachments with content making the docu‐ ments appear legitimate in order to disguise embedded macros which enable malware installation System exploitation followed by downloads of steganographic PNG im‐ age files from compromised servers Use of malicious shortcut files (LNKs) to deliver payloads Use of benign decoy documents delivered intentionally to evade detection Compromising the infrastructure of various corporations in order to de‐ liver phishing emails\n\n Cozy Bear, The Dukes, CozyDuke, YTTRIUM, Hammertoss, MiniDionis\n\n\nThis espionage-focused group has also operated since at least the mid 2000s, targeting multiple\n[sectors around the world with special focus on defensive sector organizations. Multiple](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/who-is-fancy-bear/)\ngovernments have attributed the actions of this group to Russian military intelligence service, and\n[notable operations have targeted organizations such as the International Olympic Committee, the](https://www.accenture.com/t20181129T203820Z__w__/us-en/_acnmedia/PDF-90/Accenture-snakemackerel-delivers-zekapab-malware.pdf)\nOrganisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, and the Democratic National Committee\n(similar to APT29). Cybersecurity researchers identify this actor as conducting some of the most\nfar-reaching and sophisticated Russian cyber attack campaigns to date.\n\n\n### Known Tar‐ gets\n\n Sam‐ ple TTPs\n\n Also Known As\n\n## Fxmsp\n\n\n### Aerospace, Defense, Energy, Government and Media sectors, with victims in the United States, Western Europe, Brazil, Canada, China, Georgia, Iran, Japan, Malaysia and South Korea\n\n Registering domains that attempt to appear legitimately associated with victim organizations, and utilizing these domains as part of credential harvesting campaigns Abuse of OAuth access tokens in order to gain access to targeted email accounts Capturing information from air-gapped computers via infected USB devices Utilizing complex malware to target routers and IoT devices in order to enable reconnaissance within potential victim networks and potentially set the stage for wiper operations.\n\n FANCY BEAR, Pawn Storm, Sednit, SNAKEMACKEREL, Sofacy, STRON‐ TIUM, TG-4127\n\n\n-----\n\n[In May 2019, the hacking collective Fxmsp gained notoriety for reported breaches of three major](https://www.advanced-intel.com/post/top-tier-russian-hacking-collective-claims-breaches-of-three-major-anti-virus-companies)\nantivirus companies.This group targeted intellectual property from each company, including code\nbase, development documentation, and information on Artificial Intelligence (AI) modeling for the\npurposes of offering up this information for sale, as well as selling network access to victims.\n\n\n### Known Targets\n\n Sample TTPs\n\n Also Known As\n\n\n### Large global organizations and government networks\n\n Utilization of a network of trusted proxies in order to promote and offer up network accesses for sale in underground markets Creation of a credential-stealing botnet utilized to harvest usernames and passwords\n\n N/A\n\n\n## WIZARD SPIDER\n\nThis cyber criminal group targets large organizations by deploying Ryuk ransomware via Trickbot\nbanking malware. Evidence suggests that the ransom demand varies depending on the size of\nthe targeted organization, and, as of January 2019, the total amount collected by the group was\n$3.7 million USD. At the end of 2019, researchers identified that WIZARD SPIDER continues to\nadd functionality to the Ryuk variants it delivers in order to maximize the number of systems\nwithin a network impacted by file encryption.\n\n\n### Known Targets\n\n Sample TTPs\n\n Also Known As\n\n## Turla\n\n\n### United States, United Kingdom, Canada\n\n Trickbot is delivered via spam email or via the Emotet banking trojan Obfuscated PowerShell scripts execute and connect to remote IP addresses for additional tool downloads Lateral movement enabled through the use of Remote Desktop Pro‐ tocol (RDP)\n\n TEMP.MixMaster\n\n\n[Researchers have linked activity from this threat group to Moonlight Maze, a massive data breach](https://securelist.com/penquins-moonlit-maze/77883/)\nof U.S. government classified information in the late 1990s, and one of the first widely known\ncyber espionage campaigns in history. Another notable campaign took place in 2008, when\nAgent.btz malware infected U.S. government classified networks via infected removable media.\n[This group is still in active operation today. More recent operations of this Russian cyber attack](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/03/12/tracking-turla-new-backdoor-armenian-watering-holes/)\ncampaign and group have been extremely targeted, going through extensive lengths to fingerprint\n\n\n-----\n\nsystems, collecting as much information as possible, before making a determination as to\nwhether the target is of interest for further operations. One of the techniques utilized includes\nattempting to lure visitors of compromised websites to download fake Adobe Flash updates, an\napproach utilized by cyber criminals across the globe.\n\n\n### Known Targets\n\n Sample TTPs\n\n Also Known As\n\n\n### Government, Aerospace, NGOs, Defense, Cryptology, and Education sec‐ tors in more than 45 different countries throughout the world\n\n Extensive use of covert exfiltration tactics such as using hijacked satellite connections and covert channel backdoors Waterholing government websites Infecting removable storage devices In-house complex malware development\n\n Snake, Venomous Bear, Waterbug, Uroburos\n\n\n## XENOTIME\n\nThis group has been identified as the most dangerous threat actor publicly known, due to its\nassociation with malware known as TRITON, designed to target a specific safety instrumented\n[system (SIS) within industrial control systems. SIS are hardware and software controls used to](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cyber-attacks/xenotime-hacking-group-behind-triton-found-probing-industrial-control-systems-of-power-grids-in-the-us)\nimplement safe states in order to avoid adverse safety, health, and environmental consequences,\nand, as such, targeting of these systems could lead to loss of life scenarios. TRITON was\ndiscovered at a petrochemical plant in Saudi Arabia when the attacker was believed to have\ninadvertently shut down plant operations after gaining access to a SIS engineering workstation to\ndeploy the attack framework. Because TRITON malware samples are now easily discoverable\nonline, the bar has effectively been lowered for other threat actors to enter the ICS arena.\n\n\n### Known Tar‐ gets\n\n Sam‐ ple TTPs\n\n Also Known As\n\n\n### Oil, gas, and electric sectors in the Middle East, North America, Europe, and APAC\n\n Capability to gain access to hardware and software not widely avail‐ able, in order to reverse engineer proprietary protocols and identify pre‐ viously unknown vulnerabilities for exploitation Perimeter VPN compromise for initial access to target network\n\n TEMP.Veles\n\n\n## Gamaredon Group\n\nThis group notably conducts espionage and intelligence gathering via Russian cyber attack\nstrategies in support of Russian national interests, and seems to primarily focus efforts on\n[Ukrainian national security targets Cybersecurity researchers have pointed out that this group’s](https://labs.sentinelone.com/pro-russian-cyberspy-gamaredon-intensifies-ukrainian-security-targeting/)\n\n\n-----\n\ncurrent activities potentially serve as a testbed for evaluating adversarial response to TTPs, with\nthe implication that the group could pivot to utilizing these tactics against future perceived threats\nbeyond Ukraine.\n\n\n### Known Targets\n\n Sample TTPs\n\n Also Known As\n\n## FIN7\n\n\n### Ukrainian Government and Military, Journalists, Law Enforcement, and NGOs\n\n Utilization of Dynamic DNS domains for command and control servers Deployment of remote manipulation system binaries (RMS) via self- extracting archives and batch command lines Social engineering campaigns to distribute malware through macros embedded with Excel and Word documents\n\n Primitive Bear\n\n\n[The operations of this financially motivated threat group have continued well into 2020, despite](https://securityboulevard.com/2020/02/fin7-targets-new-windows-10-functionality/)\n[the U.S. Department of Justice announcing arrests in August 2018 of individuals with ties to the](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/three-members-notorious-international-cybercrime-group-fin7-custody-role-attacking-over-100)\ngroup.
