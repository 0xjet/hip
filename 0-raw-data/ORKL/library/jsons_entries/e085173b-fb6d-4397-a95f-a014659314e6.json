Past targets have included the](https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/russian-state-hackers-target/)\nWorld Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), the US Anti-Doping Agency\n(USADA), the Canadian Center for Ethics in Sports (CCES), the\nInternational Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), the\nTribunal Arbitral du Sport/Court of Arbitration for Sport (TAS/\nCAS), the Fédération Internationale de Football Association\n(FIFA), and French multinational information technology service\nAtos.\n\nRussian state-sponsored cyber groups were [observed](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/six-russian-gru-officers-charged-connection-worldwide-deployment-destructive-malware-and)\ntargeting the 2018 Winter Olympics, and according to [US and](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/six-russian-gru-officers-charged-connection-worldwide-deployment-destructive-malware-and)\n[UK authorities in 2019, Russian actors have already conducted](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-54600098)\nreconnaissance efforts against officials and organizations\ninvolved in the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. This activity was likely\nrelated to Russia’s banning from the Games for its doping\n[activities; Russia has been banned from competing as a nation](https://www.bbc.com/sport/olympics/50710598)\nin international athletics since 2015. In December 2020, Russia\n[was banned from fielding a national team in the next 2 Olympics,](https://www.tas-cas.org/fileadmin/user_upload/CAS_Media_Release_6689_decision.pdf)\nas well as any world championship sporting event for the next\n2 years.\n\nAPT28 and Sandworm, each associated with Russian\nMain Intelligence Directorate (GRU) Units 26165 and 74455,\nrespectively, are linked to past targeted intrusions against\nOlympics-related organizations. The nexus between these\nmilitary intelligence units and sports is unclear; however, there\nis a longstanding relationship between the Russian military and\nOlympic sports, with the Ministry of Defense overseeing elite\nRussian sports clubs during the Soviet era. The largest Russian\nsports club is the Central Army Sports Club (CSKA) Moscow,\nwhich has [claimed at least “1,058 medals were won by CSKA](https://web.archive.org/web/20081024043003/http://www.cska.ru/istoriya.php)\nathletes at the Olympic Games, including 463 Olympic gold\nmedals”. Therefore, the loss of national pride following the\ncountry’s bans from participation likely at least in part drives\nRussian cyber activity against international sporting events and\norganizations.\n\nFor its part, APT28 was active around the time of the 2016\n[Rio Olympics when the group conducted an influence operation](https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/2016-rio-summer-olympics/russian-hackers-publish-more-health-data-rio-2016-olympians-n648656)\nemploying pseudo-hacktivist front groups to dump drugtesting files from Olympic athletes that were likely stolen during\nintrusions into the World Anti-Doping Agency.\n\n\nSandworm was active during the 2018 PyeongChang\nWinter Olympics, [conducting destructive malware attacks that](https://www.wired.com/story/untold-story-2018-olympics-destroyer-cyberattack/)\ndisrupted the IT infrastructure of the games in South Korea\nduring the opening ceremony. A malware variant known as\nOlympic Destroyer was used to target major telecommunications\nand IT providers as part of targeting the Olympic Games in\n[PyeongChang prior to December 2017. Researchers from Talos](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/02/olympic-destroyer.html)\nand [Crowdstrike discovered that Olympic Destroyer was used](https://www.wired.com/story/untold-story-2018-olympics-destroyer-cyberattack/)\nto [disrupt the Olympic Games opening ceremony on February](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/12/technology/winter-olympic-games-hack.html)\n9, 2018. Sandworm delivered the Olympic Destroyer malware,\n[described by Kaspersky as a “destructive self-modifying](https://securelist.com/olympicdestroyer-is-here-to-trick-the-industry/84295/)\npassword-stealing self-propagating malicious program”. Their\nresearch indicated that Olympic Destroyer was delivered via\nspearphishing emails with attached documents containing\nembedded Powershell scripts that, when executed, installed\nbackdoors on targeted hosts associated with the Olympic Games,\nincluding local venues, the Pyeongchang2018[.]com server, and\n[Atos — an IT services provider.

However,\n[for internal propaganda purposes, it is likely that North Korean](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-04-08/no-north-korea-olympics-no-problem-for-gold-medals/100054850)\nstate media, which is closely controlled by the regime, will\ndoctor photos and fabricate articles of their athletes winning\ngold medals.\n\nNevertheless, North Korean threat groups have a limited\nhistory of targeting Olympics-nexus organizations. In February\n[2018, McAfee detected a fileless malware, dubbed Gold Dragon,](https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/gold-dragon-widens-olympics-malware-attacks-gains-permanent-presence-on-victims-systems/)\nwhich was used to target Olympics-related organizations. The\nfirst Gold Dragon variants that McAfee observed in the wild in\nSouth Korea appeared in July 2017. The original Gold Dragon\nmalware had the file name “한글추출.exe”, which translates as\n“Hangul Extraction” and was seen exclusively in South Korea.\nWhile initially no attribution to North Korea was made, in August\n2018 McAfee released a [comparison of North Korean malware](https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/examining-code-reuse-reveals-undiscovered-links-among-north-koreas-malware-families/)\nwhere code overlaps between Gold Dragon and NavRAT were\n[detailed. Various](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/05/navrat.html) [reports in 2018 mentioned that NavRAT is likely](https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/examining-code-reuse-reveals-undiscovered-links-among-north-koreas-malware-families/)\nlinked to North Korean APT Group123 (also tracked as APT37).\n\n\n-----\n\n[In November 2020, Cybereason published details regarding](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/back-to-the-future-inside-the-kimsuky-kgh-spyware-suite)\nthe similarities in URL patterns and infrastructure used by Gold\nDragon and several other malware linked to Kimsuky, another\nNorth Korean state-sponsored threat group. Kimsuky has\nhistorically [targeted individuals and experts in various fields,](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/TLP-WHITE_AA20-301A_North_Korean_APT_Focus_Kimsuky.pdf)\nthink tanks, and government entities in South Korea, Japan,\nand the United States, as well as universities with biomedical\nengineering expertise.\n\n##### China\n\n APT Threat Groups and Activity\n\nThere is no historical precedent for Chinese threat activity\ngroups targeting major international sporting events or sporting\nbodies. China has also shown significantly more restraint\ncompared to other nations in conducting wide-reaching\ndestructive or disruptive attacks. Therefore, while Chinese\ngroups have [regularly](https://www.recordedfuture.com/chinese-cyberespionage-operations/) [targeted specific organizations and](https://www.recordedfuture.com/reddelta-targets-catholic-organizations/)\ngovernments ahead of key talks, and Beijing’s cyber-enabled\nmonitoring of ethnic and religious minorities domestically and\n[internationally is well documented, it is unlikely that China poses](https://about.fb.com/news/2021/03/taking-action-against-hackers-in-china/)\na disruptive threat to the Olympic Games at this time.\n\nHowever, Japan remains a major focus of Chinese cyber\nespionage efforts both through threat activity groups affiliated\nwith China’s principal civilian foreign intelligence service, the\nMinistry of State Security (MSS), and its military intelligence\napparatus, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) Strategic Support\nForce (SSF), due to the regional proximity between the two\ncountries.\n\nRecorded Future tracks several Chinese groups (detailed\nbelow) with a strong Japan focus that could lead them to conduct\nintelligence-gathering operations targeting Olympic officials and\nsponsors. Furthermore, athletes or individuals who may seek\nto use publicity associated with the Olympics to shed light on\npurported human rights abuses within China, such as that of\nUyghur Muslims in Xinjiang, are more likely to be individually\ntargeted for monitoring and surveillance purposes. The main\nChinese APT groups with a Japan focus are the following:\n\n  - APT10, also known as Stone Panda, CVNX, MenuPass,\n\nPOTASSIUM, and Red Apollo, is a Chinese statesponsored threat group that has been active since\napproximately 2009. The group, composed of private\ncontractors who operate through a series of front\n[companies, operates on behalf of Tianjin State Security](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-chinese-hackers-associated-ministry-state-security-charged-global-computer-intrusion)\nBureau, a provincial bureau of China’s MSS. While APT10\n[has always had a focus on Japan, the group has also](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2018/09/apt10-targeting-japanese-corporations-using-updated-ttps.html)\n[targeted organizations globally. However, post-US](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/china-cyber-cloudhopper/)\n[government indictment, the group has become even](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-chinese-hackers-associated-ministry-state-security-charged-global-computer-intrusion)\nmore regionally focused, with all recently published\n[activity specifically](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/cicada-apt10-japan-espionage) [targeting Japan-linked private sector](https://securelist.com/apt10-sophisticated-multi-layered-loader-ecipekac-discovered-in-a41apt-campaign/101519/)\n\ni ti\n\n\n\n  - Tick, also known as Bronze Butler, has historically\n\n[used custom malware variants to target defense,](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/19/k/operation-endtrade-finding-multi-stage-backdoors-that-tick.html)\naerospace, chemical, and satellite industries, primarily\nfocused on organizations with head offices in Japan\nand subsidiaries in China. In April 2021, Japanese news\n[sources reported that the group is linked to PLA-SSF](https://therecord.media/japanese-police-say-tick-apt-is-linked-to-chinese-military/)\n[Unit 61419 located in Qingdao. Tick is suspected of](https://vblocalhost.com/uploads/VB2020-Lunghi-Horejsi.pdf)\nhaving close links to Tonto Team, another Chinese group\n[which both targets Japan and has been linked to the](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2020/03/bisonal-10-years-of-play.html)\nPLA, specifically the Shenyang Military Region Technical\nReconnaissance Bureau. While the groups have distinct\ntactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and targeting\n[profiles, they have been identified sharing capabilities. In](https://vblocalhost.com/uploads/VB2020-Lunghi-Horejsi.pdf)\n[early 2020, Tick Group was linked to a historical intrusion](https://www.scmagazine.com/home/security-news/apts-cyberespionage/mitsubishi-electric-discloses-june-2019-breach-tick-hacking-group-reportedly-blamed/)\ndisclosed by the Japanese multinational Mitsubishi\nElectric.\n\n[• A 2020 JPCERT report observed the use of WINNTI](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/doc/IR_Report2020Q2_en.pdf)\n\nmalware in targeted attacks reported around August\n2020. In previous years, various Japanese security\n[researchers (1, 2) also observed the use of the WINNTI](https://hitcon.org/2018/pacific/downloads/1214-R2/1330-1400.pd)\nmalware variants all the way from 2013 to 2020. WINNTI\n(aka HIGHNOON) is a longstanding backdoor and rootkit\nthat has been historically used by multiple APT groups,\n[including APT17 and APT41.](https://content.fireeye.com/apt-41/rpt-apt41/)\n\n  - Numerous reports from Japan’s Computer Emergency\n\n[Response Team (JPCERT) indicate that Blacktech, also](https://blogs.jpcert.or.jp/en/tags/blacktech/)\nknown as Palmerworm and Temp.Overboard, was highly\nactive in 2017 and 2018 targeting Japanese corporations,\n[with recent](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/palmerworm-blacktech-espionage-apt) [reporting indicating the group’s continued](https://www.cyberandramen.net/home/blacktech-doesnt-miss-a-step-a-quick-analysis-of-a-busy-2020)\n[activity. BlackTech was also named in a 2019 breach](http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/13388776)\nagainst the major Japanese multinational Mitsubishi\nElectric, the same organization subsequently targeted by\nTick. The same Japanese sources also link BlackTech to a\nmilitary unit based in Wuhan; however, the group has not\ncurrently been attributed to a specific PLA unit.\n\n##### Iran\n\n APT Threat Groups and Activity\n\nIranian APTs have not been previously identified launching\ndestructive cyberattacks or cyber espionage intrusions\nagainst the Olympics or organizations associated with sporting\nfederations. This does not, however, preclude Iranian APTs from\nleading espionage intrusion attempts against organizations\nsupporting the Olympics or people attending them. Of the\nmajor Iranian threat activity groups, APT39 would most likely\nbe responsible for penetrating anti-government networks that\nmay attempt to use the Olympics in Japan as an opportunity\nto engage with Iranian athletes, their teams, and government\nrepresentatives. As such, facilities hosting Iranian athletes are\nat increased risk of targeting.\n\n\n-----\n\nIranian domestic politics have been rife with politically\nmotivated sporting controversies. These have included the\n[boycotting of the Olympic Games and sporting competitions](https://www.cbc.ca/sports/olympics/summer/judo/iran-4-year-ban-judo-anti-israel-policy-1.6007520)\n[involving athletes from Israel, as well as those involving female](https://www.rferl.org/a/iran-women-s-boxing-banned-khuzestan-province/30646796.html)\n[athletes and supporters. The use of thematic lures linked to the](https://www.rferl.org/a/iran-women-s-boxing-banned-khuzestan-province/30646796.html)\nOlympics has also not historically been part of observed Iranian\nAPT tactics. However, the potential for Iranian APT groups to\nexpand into the sporting realm is elevated in particular with\nregards to Iranian domestic political activity, and in relation to\nother Middle Eastern sporting and Olympic federations.\n\nAt least 2 known Iran-nexus threat actors, APT35 (Charming\nKitten and Phosphorus) and APT39 (Rana Intelligence Computing\n[Company and Chafer), are reported to maintain intelligence and](https://cyware.com/news/charming-kitten-apt-launched-spoofing-attacks-against-key-personalities-c8152b35)\ncounterintelligence requirements that could lead them to launch\nattacks against organizations and individuals attending the\n[2020 Olympics. APT35 has been reported to seek strategic and](https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/collateral/en/mtrends-2018.pdf)\n[tactical information and has also undertaken counterintelligence](https://www.clearskysec.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Charming_Kitten_2017.pdf)\noperations at the behest of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard\nCorps (IRGC). APT39 has also been reported to focus on\n[counterintelligence and long-term espionage activity.](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2019/01/apt39-iranian-cyber-espionage-group-focused-on-personal-information.html)\n\n[According to an October 28, 2020 Microsoft report, APT35](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/10/28/cyberattacks-phosphorus-t20-munich-security-conference/)\nled an espionage campaign masquerading as conference\norganizers for the Munich Security Conference and Think20 (T20)\nSummit in Saudi Arabia. Microsoft’s Threat Intelligence Center\n(MSTIC) assessed that the primary goal of this campaign was\nthe targeting of high-profile individuals attending the security\nconferences, including ambassadors and senior policy experts.\nDuring the operation, APT35 sent spoofed email invitations to\nformer government officials, policy experts, academics, and\nleaders from non-governmental organizations (NGOs). The\nemails used near-perfect English and included invitations to\nremote sessions to assuage fears of travel during the COVID-19\npandemic.\n\nWhile Recorded Future has not detected any APT35-linked\nactivity that would signal an intent to target the Japanese\ngovernment, the host city, or any organization linked to the\nplanning of the Olympics, APT35 would likely demonstrate the\nsame TTPs as in past campaigns in their use of Olympic-themed\nlures to target conferences and events that are either occurring\nbefore, during, or after the Olympics. This also includes the\ntargeting of researchers, political, policy, and diplomatic officers\nattending conferences.\n\n[APT39 has previously been linked to counterintelligence and](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/boston/news/press-releases/fbi-releases-cybersecurity-advisory-on-previously-undisclosed-iranian-malware-used-to-monitor-dissidents-and-travel-and-telecommunications-companies)\n[surveillance operations, as well as targeted intrusions against](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/boston/news/press-releases/fbi-releases-cybersecurity-advisory-on-previously-undisclosed-iranian-malware-used-to-monitor-dissidents-and-travel-and-telecommunications-companies)\ngovernment networks, travel, and the telecommunications\nsectors, at the behest of the Ministry of Intelligence and Security\n(MOIS). This threat actor group, and those maintaining similar\noperations, is likely to be tasked to track Iranian athletes and\ndiaspora community members activists and Iranian dissidents\n\n\nOpen source reporting has also indicated that intragovernmental targeting has also occurred, whereby members\n[of the IRGC led targeted intrusions against cabinet members of](https://www.bbc.com/persian/iran-42558658)\nPresident Hassan Rouhani. While there is no direct link between\nAPT39 and the Olympics, such instances of past targeting\nreveal the increased likelihood of surveillance against Iranian\ngovernment officials who may attend the Olympics.\n\n##### Financially Motivated Cyber Threats\n\n Criminal Targeting\n\nRecorded Future has not identified direct threats, planned\nattacks, or cyber operations against the Tokyo Olympic Games\namong dark web and underground forums, with posts referencing\nthe Olympics found primarily on the following underground\nforums: Club2CRD, Omerta, Korovka, Verified, and the Honker\nUnion of China. The majority of the relevant posts found on these\nsources are related to such topics as:\n\n  - News media citations and reposting\n\n  - Advertisements and sales of pharmaceuticals/\n\nmedications\n\n  - Sales of compromised login account credentials\n\nrelated to the Olympic Games and affiliated Olympic\norganizations\n\n  - Mentions of the Olympics in filenames leaked on\n\nransomware extortion websites\n\nA further 2 dark web marketplaces were observed selling\ninformation related to the 2020 Olympic Games: Genesis Store\nand Russian Market.\n\n**Genesis Store: Recorded Future identified references to the**\n2020 Olympic Games on Genesis Store, a dark web market that\nsells victim information in a format that the group refers to as\n“bots”. Bots include combinations of victim account credentials,\nbrowser fingerprints, IP addresses, and session cookies. All 20\nbrowser logins discovered on the Genesis Store were related to\ntokyo2020[.]org, the website of the organizing committee. One\nsubdomain appears to be dedicated to the Japanese volunteers\nof the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.\n\n**Russian Market: Recorded Future also found references listed**\nin connection with the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games on Russian\nMarket, a shop operated by the threat actor “RussianMarket”\nthat sells dumps, RDP and SSH access, logs, and various account\ndetails. Similar to the Genesis Store, Russian Market contains\nvarious website logins to “tokyo2020[.]org”. Gaining access to\nthese credentials would allow threat actors who buy them to\nlog into the accounts and perform malicious activity such as\nbusiness email compromise (BEC), privilege escalation, and an\noverall online identity takeover of the legitimate credential holder\n\n\n-----\n\nThis is due to the fact that the sets of credentials typically have\nextensive information about the source of the credentials and\ncookies scraped from the victim.\n\n##### Ransomware Threats\n\nRansomware likely poses the greatest cybercriminal threat\nto Olympics-nexus organizations. On June 25, 2021, various\nnewspapers in Japan [reported that the Japanese Olympic](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20210625/k10013103001000.html)\nCommittee (JOC) was affected by ransomware in April 2020.\n\nRecorded Future has not observed chatter or indicators\nsuggesting that ransomware operators are specifically targeting\nOlympics-related organizations at this time. However, as\nransomware operations are generally opportunistic in nature,\nand due to the high-profile, international nature of the games,\nsuch organizations are likely to be attractive targets for\nransomware operations. The downtime of core infrastructure\nand services is unlikely to be acceptable during the games; as\na result, the victims are likely to be induced to pay ransoms and\nrestore normal operations quickly.\n\nRecorded Future examined ransomware extortion websites\nsince January 2020 and identified 35 references to 2020 Olympic\nGames-related entities posted on Corporate Leaks, an extortion\nwebsite managed by Nefilim ransomware operators. The website\nis used to post the name or domain of victims infected with\nNefilim ransomware, along with a sample set of data stolen from\nthe victim network. Analysis of the content posted on Corporate\nLeaks indicated that the Olympic Games-related documents\nwere likely a part of an attack against Luxottica Group, an Italian\neyewear conglomerate and the world’s largest eyewear company,\nwhich was hit by a ransomware attack in September 2020.\nWe identified the following Tokyo Olympic-related documents\npublished by the Nefilim ransomware operators:\n\n  - 24532 2020-01-13 11:08 LUXOTICA_other_part_8\\2020\n\nMarketing Plans\\Mugello + Tokyo Olympics\\MOTOGP\nSimulation (WHSL).xlsx\n\n  - 758183 2020-01-13 11:09 LUXOTICA_other_part_8\\2020\n\nMarketing Plans\\Mugello + Tokyo Olympics\\Tokyo\nOlympic + Mugello 2020 - TH.pptx\n\n  - 0 2020-01-14 03:39 LUXOTICA_other_part_8\\2020\n\nMarketing Plans\\Mugello + Tokyo Olympics\n\n#### Threats to Olympic Infrastructure\n\nThe 2020 Olympic infrastructure faces threats from several\nsources, including both cyberattacks and physical threats. We\nbelieve that as the opening date for the Olympics approaches,\nthere will likely be an increase in phishing attempts made\nagainst Olympics employees, partners, vendors, and customers.\n\n\nAdditionally, Olympic planners and policymakers should be\nalert to commonly used techniques involving distributed denial\nof service (DDoS) attacks, website defacements, domain\ntyposquatting, and spearphishing attacks.\n\n##### Phishing Attacks\n\nParticular vigilance against phishing attacks is warranted,\nas this has been a common vector for APT and other threat\ngroups to target Olympic infrastructure during past games.\nThese phishing attacks can lead to malware infections, causing\nloss of data as well as physical damage to Olympic properties.\n\nWe identified approximately 721 references to Olympicsrelated phishing events in the last 3 months. While threat\nactor attribution for phishing events is difficult, we observed\ncommon themes in the structure of the phishing messages, such\nas the use of urgent language in emails, the impersonation of\nexecutives or vendors, and the use of malicious websites posing\nas vendors or ticketing systems. It is likely that the overall goals\nof these phishing emails were to install malware on targeted\nnetworks and to gather user credentials that could be used for\nmore targeted attacks.\n\nThe 2020 Tokyo Olympics was affected by a May 2021\n[compromise of the ProjectWEB platform. ProjectWEB is a](https://therecord.media/fujitsu-suspends-projectweb-platform-after-japanese-government-hacks/)\nJapanese cloud-based enterprise collaboration and file-sharing\nplatform launched in the mid-2000s and is broadly used today\nby Japanese government agencies. In the intrusion, an unknown\n[threat actor was able to access ProjectWEB and obtain at least](https://pr.fujitsu.com/jp/news/2021/05/25.html)\n76,000 email addresses, proprietary information, and email\nsystem settings. The attackers then gained access to Japan’s\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs and Tokyo’s Narita International\nAirport through ProjectWEB and stole air traffic control data,\nflight schedules, and information on business operations.\n\nOn June 2, 2021, the Japanese government’s National Center\nof Incident Readiness and Strategy for Cybersecurity (NISC)\nconfirmed in a [statement](https://www.nisc.go.jp/press/pdf/20210602NISC_press.pdf) that the compromise had exposed\ndata of some 170 people who participated in a cybersecurity\ndrill ahead of the Olympic Games. The leaked data included the\nnames and affiliations of people from 90 organizations involved\nin hosting the Olympics, according to a Japan Times [article.](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2021/06/04/national/tokyo-olympics-data-breach/)\nHowever, the ProjectWEB intrusion was likely a supply chain\nattack to steal information from various Japanese organizations\nas opposed to a targeted attempt to compromise the Olympics,\nwith the main users of the ProjectWEB platform being Japanese\ngovernment agencies.\n\n##### DDoS and Website Defacements\n\nA primary threat to previous Olympics,such as those in\nPyeongChang and Rio de Janeiro,was DDoS attacks performed\n\n\n-----\n\nby hacktivist groups .However,Recorded Future has not\nidentified organized hacktivist groups announcing their intent\nto target 2020 Olympics infrastructure at this time.\n\nPast campaigns include the 2016 Anonymous campaign\n[#OpOlympicHacking,which has been the most widely noted in](https://www.rsa.com/en-us/blog/2016-08/major-events-and-hacktivism-opolympichacking)\nregards to targeting the Olympic Games .The aforementioned\n[campaign saw hacktivists using social media channels to](https://www.rsa.com/en-us/blog/2016-08/major-events-and-hacktivism-opolympichacking)\norganize coordinated DDoS attacks,discuss vulnerabilities within\ntargeted networks,and announce the results of campaigns.\nThese attacks were not limited to Olympic-related websites,\nbut also affected companies related to the Olympics such as\nsponsors,hosting cities,and governmental websites.\n\n[However,our data and analysis indicate that,similar to](https://securityintelligence.com/posts/the-decline-of-hacktivism-attacks-drop-95-percent-since-2015/)\n[research conducted by others over the past year,chatter](https://securityintelligence.com/posts/the-decline-of-hacktivism-attacks-drop-95-percent-since-2015/)\nsurrounding hacktivist attacks has been in steep decline since\na peak between 2015 and .2016 The number of large enterprises\nsusceptible to SQL injection attacks or DDoS floods has\ndecreased,likely due to more mature website structures and\nthe use of [DDoS protection services](https://www.business.com/categories/best-ddos-protection-services/) like Akamai and Cloudflare.\nAlthough some hacktivist actors are highly skilled,more often\nthan not many members of a hacktivist organization are novices\nand rely upon [simple and outdated tools and techniques](https://security.radware.com/ddos-threats-attacks/threat-advisories-attack-reports/opisrael-2018/) that are\neasily defeated by competent network defenders.\n\n_[Figure 1: Media mentions of hacktivism-related cyberattacks, 2010–2019 (Source: Recorded Future)](https://www.recordedfuture.com/international-hacktivism-analysis/)_\n\nHacktivist groups rely on media attention to spread their\nmessage, and disruptive cyber activities during the event will\n[receive immediate press attention, as observed during the 2018](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-olympics-2018-cyber/games-organizers-confirm-cyber-attack-wont-reveal-source-idUSKBN1FV036)\nPyeongChang Olympics. For example, various Iranian hacktivist\ngroups have historically launched targeted website defacement\nattacks against international football teams, either in support\nof a local Iranian team competing in international competitions\nor in support of Iran’s national football team. Such attacks have\nbeen committed by members responsible for the ALFA TEaM’s\nAlfaShell and have targeted a host of international and regional\nfootball sporting organizations.\n\n\n_Figure 2: Defacement imagery posted by ALFA TEaM members against the Syrian Soccer_\n_Federation (Source: tarafdari[.]com)_\n\nIn large part, attacks such as those committed against\nthe Syrian Football Federation after a 2018 FIFA World Cup\nqualifying game, or against Bahrain’s Football Association (BFA)\nafter a 2022 World Cup qualifier, materialized as hacktivists\nperceiving a sense of injustice or in response to insults against\nthe Iranian football team or nation. Given the current [tensions](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2021/05/26/national/south-korea-japan-survey-2/)\nbetween Japan and South Korea as well as the political disputes\n[related to the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands with China, a nationalistic](http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/14366336)\nhacktivist campaign out of China in particular targeting Japanese\ninfrastructure is plausible but deemed unlikely given the recent\ndecline in patriotic hacktivism in recent years.\n\n_Figure 3: The website of the BFA is defaced by ALFA TEaM after perceived insults heard during the_\n_Iranian national anthem at a Bahraini stadium (Source: ILNA News[1])_\n\n1 https[:]//www.ilna[.]news/%D8%A8%D8%AE%D8%B4%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%B2%D8%B4%DB%8C-7/825013%D8%B3%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%AA-%D9%81%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%B3%\nDB%8C%D9%88%D9%86-%D9%8\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Tokyo Olympics-Themed Domains\n\nSince April,2021,1 Recorded Future has observed the\nregistration of 44 domains that mimic the 2020 Olympics and\nits branding .Additionally,we believe that while the majority of\nthese domains resolve to generic domains that are currently\nparked,the pages will likely become more active as the start of\nthe games draws nearer.\n\nWhile no malicious activity was observed at the time of\nwriting, some subset of these domains will likely be used for\nfuture malicious purposes closer to the start of the Olympics. A\nfull list of these domains is included in Appendix A.\n\n#### Non-Cyber Threats to the 2020 Olympics\n\n##### Information and Influence Operations\n\nNation-state propaganda and disinformation outlets are\nengaging in initial influence activities against the Tokyo games\nto generate controversy and undermine the event as unpopular,\nunsafe, or unfair.\n\nBefore COVID-19 forced the cancellation of the Tokyo\ngames in 2020, the Cyber Threat Alliance (CTA) [predicted](https://www.cyberthreatalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/CTA-2020-Olympics-Threat-Assessment-Report_Final.pdf)\nthat disinformation campaigns surrounding the Olympics were\n“most likely” alongside disruptive cyberattacks. Furthermore,\nCTA judged that malicious cyber activities “are likely to come\nin the form of social media or disinformation campaigns rather\nthan direct attempts to compromise a specific organization”.\nThis likelihood was further compounded by [Russia’s Olympics](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-37352326)\n[ban, which almost certainly angered the Kremlin and would at](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-37352326)\nthe very least compel the state to engage in state-sponsored\novert influence activities to undermine the Olympics or athletes\ncompeting in the games from other nations.\n\nWith the games currently set to occur and with minimal\nchanges in Russia’s eligibility to participate (Russian athletes are\nparticipating under the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC), not\nthe Russian Federation), we believe that Russian disinformation\nactivities remain likely to materialize.\n\n##### COVID-19\n\nSince the outbreak of COVID-19, foreign governments, state\npropaganda and disinformation outlets, and social media have\npresented false and misleading narratives about the symptoms\nand the lethality of the virus, treatments and therapeutics, case\nnumbers, and more recently the efficacy of vaccines, as well as\nlegal and moral debates over their use. As we approach the Tokyo\nOlympics, we believe that COVID-19 will remain a persistent topic\nof debate in media coverage and will almost certainly serve as a\n\n\nsub-theme of disinformation and propaganda. Broadly speaking,\nwe expect to identify at least isolated false claims both in local\nJapanese media and abroad regarding regional case counts,\nvariants in the wild, and potentially misleading information about\nthe safety of the local population as athletes from around the\nworld arrive in Japan.\n\nAdditionally, it is likely that COVID-19-related misinformation\nand disinformation will spread about specific venues, including\nCOVID-19 mitigation procedures (like testing, masks, and other\nmandates such as vaccines) at both sporting event venues and\nother high-traffic areas such as the Olympic Village.\n\nFinally, there is a strong chance of targeted false narratives\nand disinformation targeted at country athlete delegations, such\nas claims stating that certain athletes or country delegations\n“brought” a virus variant or were the cause of an internal outbreak\n[that places the public at risk. In 2020, the US military found itself](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-usa/china-government-spokesman-says-u-s-military-may-have-brought-virus-to-china-idUSKBN20Z196)\nthe subject of a false claim produced and amplified by Chinese\nstate officials and official state outlets that suggested that\nmilitary officials introduced COVID-19 to the Chinese public after\nthe 2019 Military World Games in Wuhan, Hubei province, China,\nbefore the first cases of COVID-19 were documented. Chinese\n[authorities have repeatedly reintroduced this conspiracy theory](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/20/china-revives-conspiracy-theory-of-us-army-link-to-covid)\nwithout any supporting evidence.\n\nWe have identified Russian state media outlets concentrating\non the following themes:\n\n**• The 2020 Tokyo Games are unsafe: Russian state media**\n\noutlets have portrayed the Olympic organizing committee\n[as taking a poorly calculated risk amid COVID-19](https://www.rt.com/sport/521972-japan-covid19-emergency-olympics/)\n[emergencies in Japan, assessed that the Olympics may](https://sputniknews.com/sport/202104151082635474-tokyo-olympics-may-be-cancelled-if-situation-around-covid-19-worsens---report/)\nbe canceled altogether with rising cases, and questioned\n[the event after North Korea elected to not compete for](https://www.rt.com/sport/520189-north-korea-skip-olympics/)\nsafety reasons.\n\n**• The 2020 Tokyo Games are unpopular with the general**\n\n**public: Russia Today has extensively covered the**\nJapanese public’s lack of support for the games due to\nCOVID-19.

One RT editorial in 2018 called WADA a](https://www.rt.com/sport/513580-rusada-ban-cas-doping/)\nconduit for “anti-Russian agendas”.\n\n##### Protests and Negative Sentiment\n\nThe Olympic Games have historically been used as a\nplatform to amplify voices to current events as well as social\ncauses. Thomas Bach, the President of the International Olympic\nCommittee, received backlash due to his comments that athletes\nshould not use the Olympic Games to stage [political protests,](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michellebruton/2020/10/26/ioc-president-thomas-bach-olympics-are-not-about-politics-athletes-should-be-politically-neutral-at-games/)\n[such as wearing apparel associated with the Black Lives Matter](https://fox8.com/news/olympics-bans-black-lives-matter-apparel-could-punish-athletes-for-social-protests/)\n(BLM) movement. Current events and social causes that are\nlikely to be promoted by athletes and other Olympic Games\nparticipants have been highlighted below.\n\n##### Black Lives Matter and Racial Justice Protests\n\nBLM and the Olympics were in the news together in April\n2021 when the IOC confirmed Rule 50 as described in a [press](https://olympics.com/ioc/news/ioc-athletes-commission-s-recommendations-on-rule-50-and-athlete-expression-at-the-olympic-games)\n[release applied to BLM clothing, symbols, or gestures. This](https://olympics.com/ioc/news/ioc-athletes-commission-s-recommendations-on-rule-50-and-athlete-expression-at-the-olympic-games)\nalso includes, per an IOC-produced [document from January](https://stillmedab.olympic.org/media/Document%20Library/OlympicOrg/News/2020/01/Rule-50-Guidelines-Tokyo-2020.pdf)\n2020, kneeling and raised fists, which also attracted media\nattention at the time of the document’s release. News sites in\nrecent weeks have mistakenly summarized the decision, which\nincluded phrasing that appears to indicate that Rule 50 is new\n[for the IOC or that the Japanese government had banned BLM](https://www.revolver.news/2021/05/japan-bans-blm-apparel-woke-demonstrations-at-olympic-games/)\nrepresentations specifically. Any BLM or similar demonstration\nwill most likely come from the participating athletes at the Tokyo\ngames. In addition to cautioning against the Tokyo Olympics\non the basis of player safety due to COVID, the World Players\nAssociation, an athlete’s union, stated in recent weeks that\nit would offer [legal support to athletes who are penalized for](https://apnews.com/article/olympic-games-europe-sports-0de805100e51d26302dc601a1fd8d48d)\npolitical gestures. Though there were [BLM protests in Japan](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/06/14/national/black-lives-matter-spreads-tokyo-2000-people-march-protest-racism/)\nin June 2020, we believe that protests and demonstrations by\nattendees, composed of Japanese citizens and residents, would\nlikely focus on general opposition to the Olympics instead.\n\n##### Uyghur, Hong Kong, and Anti-China Protests\n\nIn addition to other possible motivations for protests or\ndisruption of the games, anti-China sentiment related to ongoing\ncontroversies about political events in Hong Kong or the treatment\nof the Uyghur ethnoreligious minority in China may also motivate\ndemonstrations. Already, there are demonstrations and calls to\n[boycott the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing over these issues,](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3134009/us-lawmakers-ramp-pressure-beijing-olympics-boycott)\n\n\nwhich will likely dominate narratives in China-related protests.\n\n##### Domestic Japanese Opposition\n\nIn addition to global movements and events, there is also\nstrong domestic opposition in Japan to hosting the Olympics.\nRecent polling by the Japanese magazine Asahi Shimbun\n[showed that 83% of respondents oppose the Olympics, stating](http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/14351670)\na preference for the games to either be canceled or postponed,\nwith a narrow majority of those preferring the cancellation of\nthe Olympics. This poll resembles similar surveys conducted in\nJapan in recent months. There have been numerous protests of\nvarying sizes against the protests, primarily near the IOC’s Tokyo\nheadquarters. None of these protests has become violent as of\nthe time of writing.\n\nThe primary motivation for opposition to the Olympics is\nfear of worsening the COVID-19 situation in Japan. The most\ncited additional concerns, per Recorded Future investigations in\nJapanese-language social media discussions on the topic of the\nOlympics, are anger at the Japanese government for not obeying\nJapanese public opinion and environmental damage caused by\nhosting the Olympics. On the latter, much of this discussion has\n[centered on the Olympic Village. Environmentalist groups seeking](https://www.2020games.metro.tokyo.lg.jp/eng/taikaijyunbi/taikai/kaijyou/kaijyou_other_01/index.html)\nto protest or disrupt the Olympics would likely place a higher\npriority on targeting the Olympic Village as compared to other\npossible targets given the number of high profile athletes and the\nOlympic Village being seen as the “heart” of the Olympic Games,\nthough access to and from the Olympic Village will reportedly be\n[closely monitored and restricted by organizers due to COVID-19.](https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/sports/tokyo-summer-olympics/tokyo-olympics-will-go-ahead-even-if-state-of-emergency/2679467/)\n\nProtests leading up to and during the games will likely\ncenter around the [Japan Sport Olympic Square (JSOS), which](https://www.japan.travel/tokyo-and-beyond-2020/en/taste-of-2020/japan-sports-olympic-square/)\nhouses the offices of the Japanese Olympic Committee (JOC).\nThere have been small [protests in recent weeks at the JSOS,](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/sports/2021/05/10/olympics/summer-olympics/protesters-call-tokyo-olympics-canceled/)\nand Recorded Future assesses the frequency and size of these\nprotests will grow as the games draw near. Besides housing the\nJOC, the JSOS also contains the Japan Olympic Museum and sits\nadjacent to multiple Olympic venues, most prominently the Tokyo\nOlympics’ main venue, the Japan National Stadium.\n\n\n-----\n\nCurrently, all foreign nationals aside from those with\nresidency status are barred from [entering Japan. On June 20,](https://www.mofa.go.jp/ca/fna/page4e_001053.html)\n[2021, Tokyo and 6 other prefectures entered into a quasi-state](https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2021/06/d9efdaf124ca-covid-state-of-emergency-to-end-in-tokyo-1-month-ahead-of-olympics.html)\nof emergency, which will last until July 11. Officials have since\nhinted that the imposition of more stringent state of emergency\n[measures remains an option in the lead-up to the Games. The](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2021/06/27/national/nishimura-tokyo-coronavirus-emergency/)\n[government also announced that it is aiming to allow domestic](https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/japan-ease-state-emergency-focus-games-spectators-2021-06-17/)\nspectators to attend the Olympic games, although this figure\nat the time of writing was [set to 10,000 people, not including](https://www.bbc.com/sport/57550621)\ndelegates or sponsors.\n\nOn May 14, 2021, the Tokyo Organizing Committee of the\n[Olympic and Paralympic Games announced that they would be](https://japantoday.com/category/tokyo-2020-olympics/japan-to-cut-no.-of-visiting-tokyo-games-officials-to-less-than-90-000)\nreducing the number of visiting officials to 90,000 and that “only\npeople who have a role to play, the operational role to play will be\nin Tokyo”. This reduction was aimed toward visitors from the IOC\nand the International Paralympic Committee (IPC). Additionally,\nthis reduction would also likely affect those associated with\ninternational sports federations, media outlets, sponsors, and\ntheir guests.\n\n\n_Figure 4: Image shared on social media planning protests on May 18 in front of the JSOS building_\n_[(Source: Labornetjp)](http://www.labornetjp.org/news/2021/1620086810997staff01)_\n\n##### Physical Threats\n\nAt the time of writing, Recorded Future has not observed\nany direct physical threats aimed toward the Tokyo Olympics\nor the athletes themselves. While physical attacks are unusual\nat Olympic events, they are not [unheard of. The opportunities](https://apnews.com/article/woody-johnson-munich-atlanta-2020-tokyo-olympics-bombings-b876d5439cfb1def4c97d2fea8147065)\nfor threat actors to carry out physical attacks on spectators or\nathletes are likely reduced due to residual COVID-19 restrictions\nin Japan. Moreover, because of reduced crowd sizes, the\npotential effect of such attacks is reduced significantly.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Outlook\n\nMajor international events such as the Olympics are prime\nopportunities for threat actors globally to spy on individuals\nand organizations of interest, embarrass the host country by\ndisrupting the event, express political stances, or turn a profit\nthrough criminal activities. The upcoming 2020 Tokyo Olympic\nGames are no exception, although the threat landscape for this\niteration of the Olympics looks considerably different from those\nof previous years due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWhile COVID restrictions reduce the likelihood of physical\nthreats and widespread disruptive protests, nation-states,\ncriminals, and hacktivists alike are likely to remain motivated to\nconduct operations to achieve their various ends. For Russian\nAPT groups, for example, which we believe the most likely statebacked actor set to target the Tokyo Games, disrupting the games\nis likely to be viewed as just retribution for the country’s being\nbanned from participating. For their part, ransomware gangs\nare likely to view the games as a lucrative target for extortion\nattacks, as extended downtime of key infrastructure is likely to\nhave highly disruptive effects on the event. Finally, hacktivists,\nbe they patriotic or motivated by particular moral grievances,\nlikely view the Olympics as high-visibility opportunities to\nexpress their particular messages, but such activity has been in\ngeneral decline for several years.\n\nWhile state-sponsored and even ransomware gang activity\nis difficult to predict, as the games draw nearer, we expect\nthreat actor chatter around the event to increase, additional\ntyposquat or Olympics-themed domains to be registered and\nbecome active in credential-harvesting and malware campaigns,\nand discussions of planned protests to increase.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Appendix A\n\nA list of the observed Tokyo Olympics-themed domains is provided below:\n\n\n2021olympic[.]cn\n\n2021olympics[.]jp\n\n2021olympicupdates[.]com\n\n2021olympicupdates[.]live\n\n2021olympicupdateslive[.]com\n\ncancel-olympic[.]tokyo\n\ncxaolympicgames2021[.]org\n\nlost-olympic[.]tokyo\n\nno-olympic[.]tokyo\n\nolympic2020[.]in\n\nolympic2020in[.]tokyo\n\nolympic2021[.]in\n\nolympicgames2021[.]cn\n\nolympicgames2021.co.za\n\nolympicnewstokyo[.]com\n\nolympics2020[.]icu\n\nolympics2020[.]in\n\nolympics2020[.]vip\n\nolympics2021[.]in\n\nolympicsjapan2021[.]in\n\nolympicvirtual2021[.]com\n\nperrigoselfcareolympics2021[.]com\n\nstop-olympic[.]tokyo\n\nsummerolympics-2020[.]org\n\nteamnl2020-olympic-paralympic[.]games\n\nthe2021olympicgames[.]com\n\nthe2021olympicgames[.]org\n\nthe2021olympicstokyo[.]com\n\ntheolympicstokyo2021[.]com\n\ntokyo----olympics[.]org\n\ntokyo---olympics[.]org\n\ntokyo--olympics[.]org\n\n\ntokyo-olympicslive[.]com\n\ntokyoolympicplay.blogspot[.]com\n\ntokyoolympicplay[.]com\n\ntokyoolympics[.]org\n\ntokyoolympicsfootballlive[.]com\n\ntokyoolympicsolympics[.]com\n\ntokyoolympicsplay.blogspot[.]com\n\ntokyoolympicsport[.]com\n\ntokyoolympicswaterpololive[.]com\n\ntokyotokyoolympics[.]com\n\nusolympics2020[.]com\n\nusolympics2021[.]com\n\n\n-----\n\nAbout Recorded Future\n\nRecorded Future is the world’s largest provider of intelligence for enterprise\n\nsecurity.
