According to the report, the attackers targeted Russian federal executive\nauthorities.\n\nWhile analyzing the report, Anastasia Tikhonova (Head of APT Research at Group-IB) and\n**Dmitry Kupin (Senior Malware Analyst) noticed that they had already come across similar**\ntools in earlier attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\nChinese APTs are one of the most numerous and aggressive hacker communities. Several\ndozen groups conduct attacks in countries all over the world, and Russia is no exception.\nHackers mostly target state agencies, industrial facilities, military contractors, and research\ninstitutes. The main objective is espionage: attackers gain access to confidential data and\nattempt to hide their presence for as long as possible. There have been cases when\nattackers successfully persisted in the victim's network for several years.\n\nUnfortunately, the SOLAR JSOC and NCIRCC report did not provide indicators of\ncompromise, so the experts had to rely on descriptions of the functionality and screenshots\nof the malicious code. As a result, Group-IB's researchers came up with some interesting\nconclusions about which Chinese groups could be behind the attacks against Russian\nfederal executive authorities in 2020, what tools they used, and how their malware has\nevolved since.\nKey conclusions\n\nThe research describes Webdav-O malware detected in attacks against Russian federal\nexecutive authorities in 2020.\n\nGroup-IB experts detected two versions of the Webdav-O Trojan for x86 and x64 systems.\n\nWhen comparing parts of the code, the specialists proved that the Webdav-O x64 Trojan was\nused in attacks against Russian federal executive authorities. The malware has existed since\nat least 2018.\n\nGroup-IB specialists established that Webdav-O has a set of commands similar to a popular\nTrojan called BlueTraveller (aka RemShell), which was developed in China and has been\nlinked to the hacker group called TaskMasters.\n\nBefore that, Sentinel Labs released a report about malware called Mail-O, which was also\nidentified in attacks against Russian federal executive authorities. Mail-O was deemed to be\nlinked to the Chinese hacker group TA428.\n\nGroup TA428 is known to use a Trojan called Albaniiutas in their attacks. Group-IB's analysis\nshowed that Albaniiutas is an updated version of BlueTraveller.\n\nGroup-IB experts believe that either both Chinese hacker groups (TA428 and TaskMasters)\nattacked Russian federal executive authorities in 2020 or that there is one united Chinese\nhacker group made up of different units.\n\n**TA428 is a Chinese state-sponsored hacker group that has been operating since 2013. The**\nattackers target a number of government agencies in East Asia that control governmental\ninformation technology, domestic and foreign policy, and economic development.\n\n**TaskMasters (aka BlueTraveller) is a state-sponsored Chinese hacker group that allegedly**\nhas been active since at least 2010. The group attacks companies based in several\n\n\n-----\n\ncountries, but many of their targets are located in Russia and CIS. The hackers target solid\nindustrial and energy enterprises, government agencies, and transport companies.\nStarting point\n\nAs the experts put it: \"The report dwells on the analysis of a series of targeted attacks\".\nBased on this information, we assumed that several hacker groups may be behind the\nattacks.\n\nThe attackers used malware that interacted with management server via the cloud\nservice called Yandex.Disk. The malware was dubbed Webdav-O.\n\nAttackers also used malicious software that accessed the cloud service Mail.ru. The\nmalware was dubbed Mail-O.\n\nIn early June 2021, analysts from the American cybersecurity company Sentinel Labs\n[released a report about Mail-O. The experts wrote that Mail-O is a version of the relatively](https://labs.sentinelone.com/thundercats-hack-the-fsb-your-taxes-didnt-pay-for-this-op/)\nwell-known malware called SManager, which is used by the Chinese hacker group TA428.\n\nGroup-IB specialists wanted to make sure that Mail-O is loader, while Smanager and\nTmanger are Remote Access Trojans (RAT). However, a part of the code overlaps in the\nexported functions \"Entery\" and \"ServiceMain\" of Mail-O, SManager and Tmanger, which\nbrings us back to TA428. Moreover, hackers from TA428 have already been found to be\n[involved in espionage against Russia, especially Russian state facilities.](https://st.drweb.com/static/new-www/news/2021/april/drweb_research_attacks_on_russian_research_institutes_en.pdf)\n\nTo prove the hypothesis that TA428 was behind the attacks against Russian federal\nexecutive authorities in 2020, we decided to analyze a sample of Webdav-O. Group-IB\nThreat Intelligence & Attribution has detected similar malicious behavior before and can now\nexplain why we link it to a specific group. Below we provide an analysis of Webdav-O\nsamples and highlight features that overlap with the points mentioned in the SOLAR JSOC\nand NCIRCC report.\n\n骑驴找马 [qí lǘ zhǎo mǎ]\n\n**Verbatim translation: Ride a mule while looking for a horse.**\n\n**Definition: Use the tools you have while looking for something better.**\nAnalysis of Webdav-O sample\n\nFile \"1.dll\" is an x86 dynamic link library (DLL) that functions as a service in the system.\n\nThe analyzed file provides remote access to the command line shell (cmd.exe) and executes\nvarious commands originating from C2 on the compromised host.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe legitimate cloud service called Yandex.Disk (webdav.yandex.ru:443) is used as network\ninfrastructure, namely C&C. Network interaction with the cloud is implemented via the\nWebdav protocol. The authentication method is Basic.\n\nThe strings and configuration data are encrypted with the RC4 algorithm using the following\nkey: { 8A 4F 01 47 34 C9 75 F8 2B C8 C1 E9 D2 F3 A5 8B }. The key size is 16 bytes. The\nanalyzed files can work with 1-7 accounts (in this case only 2 are used, but we will come\nback to this later).\nFeatures of the sample\n\nThe exported ServiceMain function uses a random delay before the main code is executed.\n\n01\n\n\n-----\n\nYandex.Disk cloud accounts are checked for availability using the query \"/?userinfo\" (GET).\n\n02\n\nThe file \"/test3.txt\" is uploaded from \"Yandex.Disk\" (GET) and checked for the \"Just A Test!\"\nline. In case of success, the system checks for batch files in the \"/test\" directory of\n\"Yandex.Disk\" (PROFIND).\n\n03\n\n\n-----\n\nA command file is defined for downloading from the Yandex.Disk cloud (GET). The response\nfrom the server is processed. The name of the file with commands is between the tags:\n\n_<d:href>[name of the command file]</d:href>_\n04\n\nIn the command file, the contents are encrypted using the RC4 algorithm. After downloading\nthe command file, it is deleted from Yandex.Disk (DELETE).\n\n05\n\nThe file \"/test2.txt\" is uploaded to Yandex.Disk (PUT). The file \"/test2.txt\" contains the line\n\"Just A Test!\". The mechanism is presumably used to check the functioning of a malicious\nprogram.\n\n06\n\nThe file \"/test2/[0-9]{1,4}[0-9]{1,4}.bin\" is uploaded to \"Yandex.Disk\" (PUT). The file contains\nthe command results. Data is encrypted using the RC4 algorithm.\n\n07\n\nDescription of the commands\n\nComparison with the sample presented in the SOLAR JSOC and NCIRCC report\n\nWhen analyzing the code uploaded to VirusTotal, we found many overlapping points with the\nTrojan described in the SOLAR JSOC and NCIRCC report. Some of the common features\ncan be seen in the screenshot with the malware code, which shows the receipt of the\n\n\n-----\n\ncommand files list in the test folder:\n\n_Comparison of the Webdav-O sample from the report (on the left) to the VirusTotal sample_\n_(on the right)_\n\nComparison of Webdav-O samples\n\n**Webdav-O sample from the report**\n\n**_________________________________________**\n\nBasic authentication and OAuth\n\n_________________________________________\n\nList of commands (5):\n\n-upload\n\n-download\n\n-setsleep\n\n-quit\n\n[other command cmd.exe]\n\n**-sleepuntil**\n\n_________________________________________\n\nCommand response format:\n\n##u## %s %s (-upload)\n\n##d## %s (-download)\n\n##s## %d (-setsleep)\n\n\n-----\n\n**##l## %s (-sleepuntil)**\n_________________________________________\n\nFile objects in Yandex.Disk storage:\n\ntest2.txt, test3.txt\n\n/test\n\n/test2\n\n/test2/%04d%04d.bin\n\n**test4.txt**\n\n**test5.txt**\n\n**test7.txt**\n_________________________________________\n\nGenerates an RC4 session key (contained in the file test7.txt in encrypted form).

When we decrypted the malware\nstring, we found the following \"login:password\" for the attacker's accounts used on\nYandex.Disk.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe data discovered:\n\naleshaadams:7ujm!QAZ2wsx\n\ntstrobos:&UJM1qaz2ws\n\nIf the account login is known, it is possible to recover the email address as follows:\n\ntstrobos@yandex.ru\n\naleshaadams@yandex.ru\n\n_Attempt to recover the password for aleshaadams@yandex.ru_\n\n_Attempt to recover the password for tstrobos@yandex.ru_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe screenshots show that both accounts are linked to cellphone numbers in the same\nregion (+86), which is the country code for China.\n\nAnalysis of password generation\n\nIn 2019, Elmar Nabigaev (Deputy Director of Expert Security Center Positive Technologies)\n[delivered a report entitled \"The TaskMasters APT\" (aka BlueTraveller) and gave examples](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYuclHsoQO4&t=698s)\nof passwords discovered when investigating the malware campaign:\n\nThe images above show that the passwords to the Webdav-O account were generated using\na similar technique as TaskMasters. The only things that changed were the registry and the\nkey row combination.\n\nBlurring the boundaries\n\nConsidering all the comparisons made and the information discovered about the accounts,\nwe believe that the Chinese hacker group TaskMasters is most likely behind the attacks\ninvolving an improved version of the Webdav-O Trojan. The case of TA428, however, is still\n\n\n-----\n\nopen to debate. Could both of them be behind the attack against Russian federal executive\nauthorities in 2020? Could there be someone else involved? Or was it the same group?\n\nWe will continue our investigation and seek more information for analysis. Let us take a look\nat the report about TA428 and their new tools, in particular the Trojan called Albaniiutas,\nwhich was released by NTT Security Corporation in 2020.\n\n_Executing Albaniiutas files, NTT report_\n\nThe aim of our investigation is to study these two objects. Our reasoning will be presented\nbelow.\n\nFirst and foremost, we discovered some common points in the utility used to launch DLL:\n\nCode parts of both utilities show the similarities in more detail. As can be seen, both samples\nuse XOR encryption, which even displays identical debugging information.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Fragments of code encrypted with XOR and debugging lines in BlueTraveller (on the left)_\n_and Albaniiutas (on the right)_\n\n_Fragments of code of the XOR encrypting function in BlueTraveller (on the left) and_\n**_Albaniiutas (on the right)_**\n\nMoreover, there are common points at the stage of establishing persistence in the system.\nThe screenshots below show that the same DLL name randomization occurs. The same\ndescription of the service under which this DLL will work is also displayed.\n\n_Fragments of code with DLL name randomization in BlueTraveller (on the left) and_\n**_Albaniiutas (on the right)_**\n\nLet's continue our comparative analysis and take a look at a sample of BlueTraveller\n(SHA1:6857BB2C3AE5F9C2393D9F88816BE7A10CB5573F) and a fileless RAT belonging\nto the Albaniiutas family.\n\nWe also analyzed code parts that look very similar. For example, part of the pseudocode for\nexecuting commands in the command line shell (cmd.exe) is shown below.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Fragments of the code in BlueTraveller (on the left) and Albaniiutas (on the right)_\n\nNext, we analyzed the code parts of data processing received from the C&C server:\n\n_Fragments of the code in BlueTraveller (on the left) and Albaniiutas (on the right)_\n\nThe parts of code above show that the code in BlueTraveller is less sophisticated, but in both\ncases the separator \"\\b\" is used three times (the strtok function). Below is an example of the\ndata that Albaniiutas malware receives for each command:\n\n\n-----\n\nFormat of the data received when executing commands (retrieved from the NTT report)\n\n1\n\nIf the command is executed multiple times, the command will not be executed unless a value\nother than the previous one is specified.\n\n2\n\nSeparator\n\n3\n\nIf the value does not match the value in ③, the command will not be executed.\n\n4\n\nCommand identifier and command parameters separated by spaces.\n\nLet's also compare the code fragments for checking and executing the commands received\nfrom the C&C server:\n\n_Fragments of code in BlueTraveller (on the left) and Albaniiutas (on the right)_\n\nIt is clear that this part was updated by the hackers, but the commands remain the same:\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition, the two Trojans have a similar pattern of communicating with the control server in\nthe protocols of network interaction with the C&C server. Below is an example of network\ncommunication with the C&C server, taken from BlueTraveller samples available on\nVirusTotal.\n\nLet's move on to string obfuscation in Albaniiutas. We have established that strings are\nencrypted using the RC4 algorithm. The encryption key used is\n**L!Q@W#E$R%T^Y&U*A|}t~k.**\n\nThe same encryption key was used in the BlueTraveller server component which stores the\nlog files in the encrypted form:\n\n_A fragment of code with a line written to a log file (retrieved from PTSecurity \"Operation_\n_TaskMasters\" 2019)_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe conclusion is clear: Albaniiutas is nothing but a logic continuation of the malware\nbelonging to the BlueTraveller family.\n\nAnd then it dawned on us…\n\nWe thought that we had analyzed everything and that we were done with comparisons, when\nsuddenly a sample was uploaded to VirusTotal. We identified it as Webdav-O.\n\nThe file \"y_dll.dll\" is an x64 dynamic link library (DLL) that functions as a service in the\nsystem.\n\nAs can be seen, this version of Webdav-O was written for a system with a different bitness\nand compiled later than our sample of Webdav-O x86 (2018-12 and 2018-07, respectively).\n\nThe legitimate cloud service Yandex.Disk (webdav.yandex.ru:443) is also used as a network\ninfrastructure, in particular C2. Network interaction with the cloud is carried out via a Webdav\nprotocol.\n\nHowever, this sample supports two authentication methods instead of one in Webdav-O x86:\nBasic (with a username and password) and OAuth (using a token).\n\nThe strings and configuration data are encrypted using the RC4 algorithm with the following\nkey: { C3 02 03 04 05 DD EE 08 09 10 11 12 1F D2 15 16 }. The key size is 16 bytes. The\nanalyzed file can work with 1-7 accounts (it works with only one in this case).\n\nThis sample seemed even more similar to the one described in the SOLAR JSOC and\nNCIRCC report: unlike our sample, it has the \"-sleepuntil\" function.\n\nUnfortunately colleagues at SOLAR JSOC and NCIRCC did not provide any indicators of\ncompromise, so we can only make comparisons based on screenshots and descriptions of\nthe capabilities of their sample.\n\n**_Webdav-O sample from the report and Webdav-O x64 sample_**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Webdav-O sample from the report and Webdav-O x64 sample (processing the -sleepuntil_**\n_command)_\n\nThe parts of code presented above show that both versions look identical. Group-IB experts\nalso noticed that in Webdav-O x64, the commands and their results are transferred by\nuploading various files to Yandex.Disk:\n\nDescription of files created by Webdav-O from the report:\n\n**test2.txt, test3.txt. are files used to check the connection**\n\n**test4.txt contains information about the interval (minutes) between command requests**\nto the server\n\n**test5.txt contains the launch date for the malware**\n\n**test7.txt is uploaded to the server and contains a 16-byte RC4 key that is used to**\nencrypt commands and their results (the key is also encrypted with a public RSA key)\n\n**test is a directory containing files that are downloaded, decrypted, and processed as**\ncommands. Malware receives the file list via the PROPFIND request and by parsing\nthe necessary tags: <d:href>complete path to file</d:href>.\n\nDescription of the files created by Webdav-O x64:\n\nThe data presented above shows that this part is also identical except for the description of\ntest6.txt, which is not presented in the SOLAR JSOC and NCIRCC report.\n\nBased on the comparisons above, Group-IB experts have concluded that this particular\nWebdav-O sample was most likely used in attacks on Russian federal executive authorities\nin 2020 and it is the same Trojan as the one described in the SOLAR JSOC and NCIRCC\nreport.\nTo sum up...\n\n\n-----\n\n人心齐，泰山移 [rén xīn qí, tài shān yí]\n\n**Verbatim translation: United, people can move even Mount Taishan.**\n\n**Definition: By working together people can accomplish anything.**\n\n_Venn diagram showing the common points between the two Trojans_\n\n_(Only data presented in the blog is used in the diagram)_\n\nWebdav-O malware is a version of the BlueTraveller (RemShell) Trojan, which is classified\nas a Chinese APT. Webdav-O was designed for both x86 and x64 systems.\n\nWebdav-O may have been used by the Chinese APT TaskMasters (aka BlueTraveller).\nBased on the information about attacks on various federal executive authorities in 2020,\npresented in the SOLAR JSOC and NCIRC report, it is possible that in some cases the\nChinese APT TA428 was behind the attacks, while others could have been performed by\nTaskMasters.\n\n\n-----\n\nResearchers from SentinelLabs have linked Mail-O to Smanager and Tmanger (tools used\nby TA428). Group-IB specialists found common code parts in the malware's exported\nfunctions \"Entery\" and \"ServiceMain\". We can say with moderate confidence that Mail-O was\ndeveloped by TA428.\n\nBased on research done by NTT Security, it can be said that TA428 has already used the\nmalware Albaniiutas. Group-IB experts have shown that the Trojan is a new version of\nBlueTraveller (RemShell). As such, it can be assumed that Webdav-O is also linked to\nTA428.\n\nIt is noteworthy that Chinese hacker groups actively exchange tools and infrastructure, but\nperhaps it is just the case here.\n\nThere is also strong evidence that points to one large hacker group consisting of several\nintelligence units of the People's Liberation Army of China. For example, unit 61398 from\n[Shanghai is responsible for the actions of a well-known group called APT1 (aka Comment](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2013/02/mandiant-exposes-apt1-chinas-cyber-espionage-units.html)\n[Crew), and unit 61419 from Qingdao has been linked to Tick. Each unit attacks to the fullest,](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2021/04/20/national/chinese-military-japan-cyberattacks/)\naccording to a strict timeline and order. This means that one Trojan can be configured and\nmodified by hackers from different departments with different levels of training and with\nvarious objectives.\n\n\n-----\n\nIoCs\n\n\n\"/test\"\n\"/test2\"\n\"/test[2-7]{1}.txt\"\n\"/test/[0-9]{1,4}[0-9]{1,4}.bin\n\"/test2/[0-9]{1,4}[0-9]{1,4}.bin\"\n\"[0-9]{1,4}[0-9]{1,4}.bin\"\n\nWebdav-O is
