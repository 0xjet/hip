However, the analysis of the\nleaks of the chat logs has shown that they do not limit attacks to just large companies or\ntargets and do go after small businesses. The warnings of new attacks comes-off the heels\nof an anonymous tip believed to be the aforementioned Ukrainian researcher who leaked\nthis treasure trove of data. This blog dissects the internal chat logs that illuminate how\nConti’s organizational infrastructure is run details key figureheads, tooling as well as bitcoin\ntransactions. This analysis will help organizations better understand the inner workings of\nConti’s organizational infrastructure.\n\n## I. Conti Figure Heads\n\n\n-----\n\n**Stern: “The Big Boss”**\n\nStern is the captain of the ship; he is responsible for tasking team leads, the disbursement\nof wages, and budgeting for the tools and services needed for the organization as a whole.\nLog analysis shows Stern sending over 4000 messages to various members of the\norganization.\n\n**Salamandra: “HR/Recruiter”**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe operator Salamandra is a critical part of the success of Conti, his role is one of HR\ndepartment “ and helps in negotiating with new candidates and their roles. Salamandra also\nassists with the recruiting services and combs through resumes looking for the right\ncandidates. Salamandra is the conduit to getting people onboarded and put in the right\nposition to excel in their new role.\n\n**Bio: “Blogger/Negotiator”**\n\nBio helps the teams negotiate with the victim organization and writes blogs for Conti. These\nblogs are usually about the compromised victims and includes their captured information,\nand the percentage of data released depending upon how ransom payment goes. Bio\nmakes sure that Conti provides the decryptor key to the “customer” to honor the contract if\npaid in full.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Mango: “Team Lead”**\n\nMango, a very vocal leader responsible for Team C, is seen spearheading many different\noperations throughout the chat logs. Seen below we can see Mango informing leader Stern\non his team’s burn rate for the month.\n\n**Revers: “Tech Lead”**\n\n\n-----\n\nRevers is responsible for technical interviews with prospective new hires, helps with\nonboarding, and ensures his team and new recruits have all the equipment they need for\nwork.\n\n**Bentley: “System Admin”**\n\nBentley keeps track of server farms and sends requests to pay for expenses incurred while\npaying for multiple workers within Conti. He always makes sure that each team pays for\ntheir tooling on time and asks for crypto reports from each team lead.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Twin: “Training”**\n\nTwin is the person that could potentially be the most vital part of the Conti group, he\nprovides in-depth training and provides new recruits with different scenarios they may\nencounter when compromising a target’s environment. Twin is the “HOW TO PERSON”\n\n\n-----\n\n## II. Conti’s Organizational Infrastructure\n\n**Recruiting/Onboarding**\n\nConti recruits their workers in a few different ways, the first is recommendations from\ncurrent trusted workers. The other is using recruiting services to find candidates with the\nskillsets Conti needs to fill. One of the services that Conti uses is hhcdn.ru. This service\nallows Conti’s HR department to access the resume database to view potential qualified\ncandidates’ information. An analyzed chat from HR “Salamandra” informs “Stern” that the\nservices introduced a significant change in the pricing models but they could get a\ndiscounted rate. (hxxps://hhcdn[.]ru/file/16899324.pdf).\n\n\n-----\n\nInterviewing at Conti is a bit more problematic. Conti has the interviewees wait in a chat\nroom and gives them questions over chat and not via video. The Conti group does not have\nvideo as part of this process due to many of the candidates leaving the chat rooms before\nthe interview begins as well as a way to maintain operational security of its members. The\ncandidates that do pass the interview negotiate the terms of salary and the role they will\nhave in the organization. Once they are officially hired, they go through “Newbie Induction\nTraining”. Conti keeps the work that the new candidates will be doing vague to prevent\nrecruits from understanding too much of the organization they are joining. Call it willful\nignorance, operational security or skillful recruitment, but it looks like new candidates do not\nentirely understand the organization they’ve agreed to work for. This may be a contributing\nfactor to Conti’s high turnover rate.\n\n\n-----\n\nConti understands that the turnover ratio of workers is also very high due the fact that they\nare running a criminal organization. The Conti Group has an HR/Recruiter that assists with\nthe continual finding and recruitment of new candidates. Once the candidates begin working\non a project, the supervisors begin with onboarding the workers that require training. This\nusually encompasses training manuals and one-on-one interaction. Stern, the Boss whose\nrole we will go into his in the Conti Figure Heads section, often asks other workers, “how\nare you doing on recruiting people? can we start recruiting again or are we still training?” In\none of the chat logs released users1-8 are training to understand how to use the tools and\ntechniques in the Conti organization’s arsenal. We can see tl1 and tl2 providing direction for\ncertain situations potentially affecting workstations/networks and informing the trainees\nwhat they should do if said issues arise.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Conti’s Structure**\n\nConti understands that it needs talent with skills to continue making money through its\nvictims. The leadership of Conti provides the direction the organization will follow. With the\nConti Leaks release and the ongoing war in Ukraine, we believe Conti’s leaders will be\nmore motivated to intensify its efforts, as the rubles continue to plummet. Many analysts\nthink that due to sanctions many Russians will be moving to bitcoin until the rubles\nstabilizes. The Boss, “Stern”, provides payment via bitcoin to all workers under Conti. Many\nof Conti’s workers ask “Stern” directly for payment via bitcoin throughout the leaks.\nHowever, in the chat logs, we also see top-level managers providing burn rate summaries\nof their team’s workers and asking for payment from Stern.\n\nTeams are divided into groups, and each group is assigned a team leader. If the size of the\ngroup exceeds a certain amount, the group may have multiple leaders. Team leaders are\nresponsible for issuing work cases, helping with builds, networks, and other technical issues\nrelated to software, providing manuals and guides to newly developed software, and\nensuring their workers have the support they need to succeed. The workers are explicitly\nrequired to “Listen, Do, Learn, and Ask questions, Follow the guides and instructions,\ncomplete the assigned tasks”. The screenshot below is an example of what each group’s\nworkers are expected to do:\n\n\n-----\n\nConti is constantly hiring talent. Some messages from team leads have requests for Full\nStack developers, Crypto developers, C++ developers and php developers. Once hired they\nare assigned to a team to create different tools like lockers, spamming, backdoor tools\nand/or admin panels. Many of the web applications had been previously written in php, and\nthe released software was missing code and was almost impossible to get working. This all\nhad to be fixed. Reverse Engineers are tasked with diffing Microsoft updates to know what\nchanges come after system updates. A recent discussion with the boss to a team lead “We\nneed someone to keep track of fixes from MS and the like to know what changes come\nafter system updates, office updates, etc. Just like they track us, we need to analyze them\nand be aware of all the current changes right away. What do you think about that?”, they\n[also reverse engineer endpoint protection products to bypass protection that may tamper or](https://www.breachquest.com/?p=2263)\ninhibit their success in any way. The OSINT teams look for targets by collecting information\nfrom openly available sources online with various techniques. Admins assist in managing\ncompromised enterprise networks and collecting victim information critical to their business\nto extract the maximum amount of payment. Testers help by evaluating and verifying that\nthe Conti tooling does what it is supposed to do in specific environments. The chat logs\nreveal the daily Windows Defender signature test to ensure that Conti’s tools would not be\ndetected.\n\n**Hunting For What Matters**\n\nWhen Conti compromises an organization, they follow specific processes that they’ve used\nin the past to ensure a foothold into the network. When the Conti group compromises Active\nDirectory, they are looking for potentially interesting people like an admin, engineer, or\n[someone in IT. Many companies think that backups are sufficient, but Conti hunts for](https://www.breachquest.com/?p=2233)\nbackup servers to [encrypt the backups as well as training manuals reveal that they know](https://www.breachquest.com/?p=2261)\ntechniques to bypass backup storage vendors to make sure the backups are encrypted.\nOne of the instructions that stood out the most was a section titled “HOW AND WHAT INFO\nTO DOWNLOAD” that they state after raising the privileges to domain admin and invoke\n\n\n-----\n\nshare finder, what Conti is interested in are financial documents, accounting, clients,\nprojects, and much more. They understand that it all depends on the target organization to\nget the information needed for the victims to pay.\n\n## III. Conti’s Project Blockchain\n\nIn June of 2021, Stern sends a message to the channel asking, “Are there any of us who\nconsider ourselves blockchain gurus and trendsetters? Who might know where to go in this\ndirection and what to develop”. 21 days after his initial inquiry, he messages Logan. He lays\nout the direction for an altcoin (Altcoin: A coin other than Bitcoin) to build their own\nblockchain, and he wanted Logan to study the system, code, and working principles. Stern’s\nappetite to make Conti’s altcoin is shown to be a high-priority project.\n\n\n-----\n\nStern has been involved with ransomware activity for more than four years. In November of\n2021, Stern stated that he was losing interest in ransomware campaigns and wanted to set\nhis sights on blockchain technology and new projects. Stern has invested money in the\nblockchain department, Stern’s blockchain transactions reveal a substantial financial and\n[operational overlap. A security researcher tweeted Conti and Ryuk pay “stern” direct](https://twitter.com/JBurnsKoven/status/1498679108812877824)\ncommissions from ransom victim payments.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe chat logs reveal in February 2022 that there is a blockchain department and the team\nlead is Collin. Another team lead, Mango, informed another worker that “blockchain needs\npeople” and that the Boss approves all the expenses to try to get him to move to that\ndepartment. In another conversation from Demon and Van, “you and I are exactly where on\nthe blockchain for two years” the below screenshot shows how far they are from completing\nthe development of their own blockchain. Based on the leaks, we can infer that they are\nthinking of writing the Conti’s blockchain in Rust as there are only a dozen or more altcoins\nwritten in Rust.\n\n## IV. Conti’s Bitcoins Transaction\n\nConti, like many other ransomware gangs, used tokens like Monero for transaction\nanonymity. However, it is easier for targeted organizations to get a hold of Bitcoin when\ndealing with ransomware groups like Conti. But what we can see when using tools like\nblockchain.com is the transaction history, amount, time, and bitcoin wallet addresses used\nto pay Conti’s ransom. We extracted a total of 255 bitcoin wallets in the Conti Leaks. We\nfocused on the transaction history of these wallets and the amounts that were sent for Conti\norganizational usages like salary, tooling, and services. They are few transactions made to\nthese Bitcoin wallets. Many of them had less than three payments in total. These wallets act\nlike shell companies and one-off payments to other Bitcoin wallets are made because they\ndisguise transactions, so it does not stand out from the norm. Studying the leaks, we see\nthat Conti has spent an estimated 6 million dollars on employee salary, tooling, and\nprofessional services from January 2021 to February 2022.\n\nA tool used by Conti when dealing with Bitcoin is Segwit wallets. Segwit stands for\n“Segregated Witness” and these wallets use a technique while processing transactions that\nhelps it reduce transaction fees. Segwit tackles a major problem with bitcoin’s scalability. It\nmakes the Bitcoin blockchain lighter by storing the witness data on a sidechain, making\neach bitcoin transaction use 65% less data when recording transactions on the blockchain.\nThe lighter data allows for faster transaction speeds which lead to reduced fees, and when\ndealing with the volume of Bitcoin that Conti deals with, this can be a great benefit.\n\nConti transfers an immense amount of money via bitcoin. Some security researchers have\nestimated that Conti’s total revenue is over $2.7 billion. Ransomwhe.re has been tracking\nthe amount of money earned by different ransomware crime groups. They have reported\nthat since September of 2021 Conti has made a total of $50,881,191.17.\n\nConti puts on an eminently professional façade when conducting several of their business\nprocesses. In the “Recruiting/Onboarding” section we dive into how the hiring procedure\nworks for new recruits coming into Conti. The onboarding process might seem\nunprofessional and unstructured to the recruits, but Conti tries to cover that up with a\nlegitimate HR department. The dodgy recruiting process does deter many candidates but\nthe ones that stay are sure to be well compensated. Based on what was leaked, we can\n\n\n-----\n\nestimate that there have been 485 people that have gone through the Conti system. This\nincludes employees, victims, and potential candidates who may have declined to participate\nin the group.\n\nAnother display of Conti’s professionalism theatrics is in their data and asset recovery\nprocess. Conti takes payment seriously; when a target pays the ransom, the recovery of the\ntarget’s assets and data will be “Priority 1” on Conti’s list. Conti even has a tech support\nstaff on hand to assist targets and they are even willing to negotiate ransoms depending on\nhow prominent their target is. This small display of empathy and assistance could be a\nfactor that makes the victims more willing to pay their ransoms.\n\n## V. Conti Armament\n\n**Trickbot**\n\n[Trickbot, is a popular modular malware botnet used for credential theft. Trickbot is spread](https://www.breachquest.com/?p=2286)\n[primarily through phishing campaigns, once infected victims are subject to system](https://www.breachquest.com/?p=2303)\nreconnaissance and follow-on ransomware and additional malware infections.\n\n**Mimikatz**\n\nMimikatz is an open-source application that allows users to view and save credentials.\nConti commonly uses Mimikatz to steal credentials and escalate privileges.\n\n**Additional Conti reference guides for Mimikatz**\n\n\n-----\n\nhttps://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/blob/master/Exfiltration/InvokeMimikatz.ps1\nhttps://github.com/clymb3r/PowerShell/blob/master/Invoke-Mimikatz/InvokeMimikatz.ps1\nhttps://github.com/outflanknl/Dumpert\n\n**Cobalt Strike**\n\nCobalt Strike is used by Conti to deploy software on victim machines to perform malicious\n[actions. Functionality includes command execution, keylogging, file transfer, privilege](https://www.breachquest.com/?p=1671)\nescalation, and often the installation of Mimikatz. Conti also uses this tool for Command and\nControl (C2) and payload staging. Additional tools such as obfuscators are used in\norchestration with Cobalt to increase Conti’s success rate.\n\n**Additional Conti references for Cobalt Strike**\n\nhttps://github.com/ramen0x3f/AggressorScripts\nhttps://github.com/FortyNorthSecurity/C2concealer\nhttps://bluescreenofjeff.com/2017-08-30-randomized-malleable-c2-profiles-made-easy\nhttps://github.com/tevora-threat/PowerView3-Aggressor\nhttps://github.com/gloxec/CrossC2\n\n**Metasploit**\n\nThe Metasploit framework is an open-source tool used to probe networks and endpoints for\n[vulnerabilities.](https://www.breachquest.com/?p=1723)\n\n\n-----\n\n**Additional Resources**\n\nhttps://github.com/nccgroup/nccfsas/tree/main/Tools/SharpZeroLogon\nhttps://github.com/darkoperator/VeilPowerView/blob/master/PowerView/functions/Invoke-ShareFinder.ps1\n\n**Exploited CVEs**\n\n[The Conti group has searched for exploits related to the below CVEs. The list has 31 high-](https://www.breachquest.com/?p=2264)\npriority CVEs that Conti has developed or has done research on.

Conti is a mature and well-seasoned group that will successfully make any necessary\nchanges to mitigate the long-term damage from these leaks. Conti is known for using spearphishing campaigns to gain access and compromise networks through low-hanging fruit\n\n\n-----\n\nvulnerabilities and this tactic certainly will not change. The leaks reveal Conti s arsenal and\ntheir mindset, and researchers at BreachQuest believe that many offspring or splinter\nransomware groups will appear as this level of knowledge and insight that has never before\nbeen shared.\n\nTo ensure that you’re protected from threat actors like Conti it’s essential to have a modern\n[XDR that can defend your organization’s endpoints.
