For many people\n\nworldwide, the new normal of 2021 includes working from home, schooling from home, and\n\ntelemedicine. Doctors work to manage patients and a pandemic simultaneously.\n\nThe effects of COVID have been felt everywhere, including the cyber threat landscape. Criminals did not\n\nhesitate or waste time when it came to taking advantage of the pandemic. While the world was focused\n\non health outcomes, threat actors exploited the new conditions. While some criminal promised not to\n\ncapitalize on COVID, they did so anyway.\n\nCriminals increased their targeting of healthcare organizations, including hospitals at the front lines of\n\ncare delivery. Governments and critical infrastructure were not spared either, as attacks on those\n\nsegments spiked in the early days of the pandemic.\n\nPromises of treatments, testing, and critical medical supplies filled the internet, acting as a front for\n\nmalware distribution and data collection. Additionally, evidence of ‘Disinformation as a Service’ (DaaS)\n\nand critical elements of disinformation itself also appeared at an escalated rate. As members of our\n\nsocieties grew increasingly concerned, adversaries grew bolder.\n\nThe CTIL Dark team within the CTI League has spent countless hours volunteering their time to assist\n\nlaw enforcement, administrators, business leaders, and the general public. Their dedication to helping\n\nprotect these entities and individuals against emerging threats, cannot be understated. We are eternally\n\ngrateful for their support. CTIL Dark’s efforts have not gone unnoticed, so the CTI League saw it fit to\n\npublish this report to showcase a few of their many success stories.\n\nThis report serves as a breakdown of some of the CTIL Dark’s findings to what the criminal element was\n\ndoing during the first half of the year. We're proud to present their efforts to the public and encourage\n\nyou to reach out should you have any questions or comments.\n\nCTIL Dark Team Leads, CTI League\n\n[www cti-league com](http://www.cti-league.com/) © All rights reserved to CTI League 2021\n\n\n-----\n\n# Table of Contents\n\n### Letter from the team leaders .............................................................................................................. 3\n\n Executive Summary ................................................................................................................................ 5\n\n#### Key Insights ........................................................................................................................................................... 7\n\n Key Assessments ................................................................................................................................................. 7\n\n### Threats ......................................................................................................................................................... 8\n\n#### Ransomware .......................................................................................................................................................... 9\n\n Initial Access Brokers ...................................................................................................................................... 13\n\n Opportunistic Cybercriminals ...................................................................................................................... 14\n\n Disinformation Campaigns ........................................................................................................................... 16\n\n Scammers ............................................................................................................................................................ 19\n\n Phishing ............................................................................................................................................................... 21\n\n Databases ............................................................................................................................................................ 22\n\n### CTIL Dark in Action ............................................................................................................................... 23\n\n#### Polish nationwide hospital alerting ........................................................................................................... 23\n\n Pre-empting access to large Catholic Healthcare Organization .................................................... 24\n\n### Summary .................................................................................................................................................. 25\n\n About the CTI League .......................................................................................................................... 26\n\n[www cti-league com](http://www.cti-league.com/) © All rights reserved to CTI League 2021\n\n\n-----\n\n# Executive Summary\n\nThe healthcare sector faces many threats, including those from supply chain shortages, spikes of severe\n\nillness, and adversaries willing to do harm. While this report focuses on only one of these, we expect it\n\nwill be read in context of these other risks and acknowledging the superhuman efforts of so many in\n\nhealthcare during this impossible time.\n\nThe CTI League aims to create a safer cyberspace for the healthcare industry worldwide from cyber\nattacks by supplying reliable information, reducing the risk of compromise, supporting security\n\ndepartments, and neutralizing cyber threats. Within the CTI League there is an entire team of security\n\nresearchers and law enforcement personnel who monitor various cybercriminal underground networks\n\nwithin the Darknet and Deep/Dark web. We have termed ‘CTIL Dark’. Their days are spent looking for\n\nsigns of data breaches, targeted attacks, and any other cybercriminal activity that may impact the\n\nmedical industry or general public health. CTIL Dark focuses on three different aspects of threats:\n\n- Threats on the healthcare industry - CTIL Dark focuses on discovering emerging threats to\n\nhealthcare organizations. CTIL Dark provides an overview of the risks that can affect these\n\norganization's networks and disrupt their ability to save lives. Data breaches, network access, and\n\ncompromised assets offered for sale in the darknet are examples of these threats.\n\n- Threat actors operating in the darknet – CTIL Dark provides actionable threat intelligence to our law\n\nenforcement partners on the specific threat actor Personas of Interest (POI) who are targeting the\n\nhealthcare industry.\n\n- Threats to Public Health and Safety – CTIL Dark is focused on finding cyber threats to public health\n\nand safety, such as purchasing fake COVID vaccines, which can result in a fatal infection or even\n\ndeath. The CTI League escalates the threats discovered to inform our associates and law\n\nenforcement partners for the next steps.\n\nThe report will be the first in a series exposing what CTIL Dark has discovered and how it has responded.\n\nFrom participating in operations in concert with law enforcement to collecting evidence on COVID cure\n\nscams to a HUMINT (human intelligence) operation that prevented threat actors from gaining access to\n\na European hospital chain in less than 8 hours. CTIL Dark’s efforts have not gone unnoticed. The CTI\n\nLeague recognizes there is value in greater understanding and awareness among the public and is\n\nrevealing some of the behind-the-scenes activities that keep them safe from adversaries, whether\n\ncriminal, ideological, or state-sponsored. Readers of this report will:\n\n[www cti-league com](http://www.cti-league.com/) © All rights reserved to CTI League 2021\n\n\n-----\n\n- Learn about ransomware groups and campaigns targeting healthcare organizations during the\n\nCOVID pandemic, broken down by region and by threat group.\n\n- Explore of dark markets and sellers of COVID-themed medical products.\n\n- Understand the supply chains and dark markets for access to compromised healthcare\n\nenvironments.\n\n- See examples of the CTIL Dark in action during 2020.\n\nThis report exists in two forms.

We have found that there are a number of different types of threats exploiting the COVID\n\npandemic. Some of these threats include opportunistic cybercriminals, scammers, Nation-state\n\ndisinformation campaigns, initial access brokers, targeted ransomware, phishing, and the hybrid/other\n\nthreats.\n\n**Opportunistic cybercriminals within darknet marketplaces have mirrored the pandemic from the**\n\n**very start. When there was a shortage of masks and COVID test kits, darknet vendors started selling**\n\nthem. When the United States president embraced Hydroxychloroquine as a way to treat COVID, the\n\ndarknet vendors who once sold cocaine and other illicit drugs shifted to selling the anti-malaria\n\nmedicine. The United States passed the COVID Relief Bill and immediately following there was an\n\nincrease in tax identity theft for stimulus relief fraud.\n\n**Disinformation campaigns organized by Nation-state threat actors and Conspiracy-based groups**\n\n**have been observed on darknet Chan forums and other underground message platforms before**\n\ndissemination via automated scripted bot programs and fake medical personnel personas on social\n\nmedia.\n\n**Initial Access Brokers (IABs) seek out vulnerable networks, and once they have access, they then**\n\n**resell that information to the highest bidder. In many cases these IABs will sell victim access to**\n\nransomware groups through cybercriminal forums. In other cases, the IABs become ransomware\n\noperators themselves by joining a Ransomware-as-a-Service affiliate program.\n\n**Ransomware and the groups that deploy them have become one of most sophisticated and well-**\n\n**funded and fastest-growing cybersecurity threats. As the ‘2020 year of ransomware’ continues, the**\n\nattacks are only getting more extensive, targeted and more coordinated. Using malware to infiltrate a\n\nvictim's network to encrypt their data and restrict access until payment is made (often through the form\n\nof cryptocurrency), the cybercriminals will often then decrypt the victim's systems and show proof that\n\nthey have deleted the victim's data.\n\n### Scammers are individuals or small groups with short term goals of cheating the end- user out of money or information. CTIL Dark has interacted with scammers whose entire purpose was to sell a COVID cure that they didn’t have to unsuspecting people in fear of the pandemic and the third-order effects that came with it.\n\n[www cti-league com](http://www.cti-league.com/) © All rights reserved to CTI League 2021\n\n\n-----\n\n### Ransomware\n\n\nCTIL Dark found that perimeter vulnerabilities were the most common entry point in the healthcare\nrelated Ransomware cases we examined. Adversaries leveraged unpatched vulnerabilities and weak,\n\nreused, or default passwords in remote connectivity systems, such as Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)\n\nservers, to gain access to these servers and pivot farther into victim networks. This finding is surprising,\n\nas prevailing wisdom holds that most Ransomware stems from phishing or social engineering attacks.\n\nOne reason for this may be that many organizations deployed remote connectivity hastily because of\n\ntime-sensitive work from home mandates.\n\nPart of the CTIL Dark capabilities involves tracking ransomware groups and instantaneous alerting if\n\nthey pose a threat to the healthcare industry overall. Early on in the COVID pandemic, the CTIL Dark\n\nteam collectors saw signs that multiple RaaS (ransomware as a service) groups would respect the\n\nhealthcare groups' need to preserve operations during a global pandemic. The truce limited the threats\n\nand risks to hospitals and possibly showed some collaboration among these groups.\n\n_Figure 1 - Maze announces they will not target medical organizations during the pandemic_\n\nThe truth is that there is no honor among thieves, and as soon as the truce was broken by one, they all\n\nbegan to plunder any targets they could. The top five ransomware variants that have impacted the\n\nhealthcare industry the most in the year 2020 are Maze, Conti, Netwalker, Revil and Ryuk, making up\n\napproximately 75% of all successful attacks tracked. From October to December the CTI League\n\nobserved a dramatic uptick in focused attacks against healthcare entities, particularly small and medium\n\nsized hospitals and clinics, which impacted clinical workflows at hundreds of healthcare providers.\n\n[www cti-league com](http://www.cti-league.com/) © All rights reserved to CTI League 2021\n\n\n-----\n\n**Why the CTI League Prioritizes Ransomware**\n\nIn 2020, the incidence of cyber attacks against healthcare organizations increased dramatically, and\n\nwe believe that this trend will continue or accelerate. Unlike the majority of cyber attacks,\n\nRansomware impairs an organization’s ability to operate normally and can be destructive.\n\nCybersecurity issues that delay, degrade, or deny access to patient care can be deadly. Although no\n\ndeaths have been conclusively linked solely to Ransomware, its impacts can impact patient care. For\n\ninstance:\n\n- In 2020 the CTI League learned of a cancer center Ransomware victim where staff and patients\n\nhad to try rebuilding treatment regimen from memory.\n\n- Diagnostic imaging techniques greatly improve outcomes in cases such as strokes and trauma,\n\nso loss of these systems from Ransomware denies these benefits.\n\n- Delays in acute cardiac care, such as those when hospitals divert incoming ambulances to other\n\nfacilities, lead to a significant increase in mortality rate.\n\nRansomware during the COVID pandemic can impact healthcare across a city or a region. Under\n\nnormal conditions, a single hospital affected by ransomware can divert patients to other local\n\nfacilities which can absorb the additional load. Under COVID, many hospitals are already near or at\n\ncapacity and face workforce shortages, making it more likely that other facilities would reach or\n\nexceed capacity from a single hospital going on diversion. A Ransomware attack, such as the one in\n\nlate 2020 in New England that hobbled over 100 facilities, could trigger a region-wide cascade.\n\nThe effects on patient care from a city-wide or regional care delivery overload can be dire and\n\nheartbreaking. Stories have recently emerged from Los Angeles where the pandemic circumstances,\n\neven without Ransomware, caused hospitals to stop taking in patients, and tied up ambulances for\n\nhours waiting in line at emergency rooms across the city. Ransomware could make similar situations\n\nmore likely and more common.\n\nAt the same time, capabilities to prepare for and respond to Ransomware improve defenses against\n\nother cybersecurity issues. Organizations can decrease their likelihood of becoming a victim and\n\nreduce cost and time to recover. When adversaries exert more effort for a lesser impact, they tend\n\nto focus elsewhere, deterring future attacks against the sector and allowing healthcare organizations\n\nto continue delivering patient care to those who need it.\n\n\n[www cti-league com](http://www.cti-league.com/) © All rights reserved to CTI League 2021\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2 - Ransomware families by the number of healthcare organizations they have victimized_\n\nIn March 2020, it is believed to have started with the hacking of Hammersmith Medicines Research in\n\nLondon by the Maze ransomware group, who likely targeted Hammersmith because they were\n\nresearching a cure for COVID. CTIL Dark began extensive link analysis, intelligence collection, and\n\ngeneral forensics in coordination with strategic partners and international law enforcement to uncover\n\nthe actors’ actual identities to assist in criminal justice. Our analysts conducted extensive link analysis,\n\nintelligence collection, and general forensics to help build a bigger picture. One of our analysts tracked\n\nthe threat actor back to suspected Command and Control (C2) nodes or proxies located in Russia. The\n\nCTI League was able to share this information with Hammersmith IT teams, through our trust network,\n\nso they could block communications with the suspicious infrastructure.\n\n[www cti-league com](http://www.cti-league.com/) © All rights reserved to CTI League 2021\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3 - Maze leaks data belonging to Hammersmith Medicines Research_\n\nSince the launch of the CTI League, the threat group that operates Maze ransomware shut down their\n\noperations. CTIL Dark assess that the threat group is now operating the Egregor ransomware. CTIL Dark\n\nassesses that the volume of ransomware attacks will continue into 2021. The actions of ransomware\n\ngroups will not slow down nor stop at the door of the healthcare industry. The CTI League continues to\n\npursue these groups and keep our healthcare and law enforcement partners apprised of our findings.\n\nThe CTI League assesses that Ransomware will remain one of the largest threats to healthcare delivery.\n\nThreat actors are likely to continue increasing their attack sophistication and volume, across the sector\n\nand their supply chain. The CTI League will continue to develop our tools to help our members track\n\nand counter this threat.\n\n[www cti-league com](http://www.cti-league.com/) © All rights reserved to CTI League 2021\n\n\n-----\n\n### Initial Access Brokers\n\n\nWith the increase in the number of employees working from home due to mandatory social distancing,\n\nthe business of Initial Access Brokers (IAB) has boomed in the year 2020. An IAB is someone who gains\n\naccess into a victim's network through several vectors, with the most common being through Remote\n\nDesktop Protocol (RDP) and then selling that access to the highest bidder. RDP is consistently\n\ncompromised through a mix of open-source reconnaissance to find email formats and basic credential\n\nstuffing attacks to uncover passwords without tipping off internal detection methods.\n\n_Figure 4 - Cybercriminal persona “hardknocklife” advertises RDP access to a US Hospital_\n\nIn most cases, IABs sell directly to ransomware groups or become affiliates of Ransomware-as-a-Service\n\nprograms to ensure they get highly compensated for the victim access they acquire. From Q2 2020 to\n\nQ4 2020, the number of IABs compromising and selling access to Healthcare and other lifesaving\n\norganizations has more than doubled. The highest impacted regions by IABs targeting the healthcare\n\nindustry are North America, Europe, Asia, and the Middle East.\n\n\n_Figure 5 - Initial Access Brokers targeting Healthcare industry by Region_\n\n\n[www cti-league com](http://www.cti-league.com/) © All rights reserved to CTI League 2021\n\n\n-----\n\n### Opportunistic Cybercriminals\n\n\nCTIL Dark have observed opportunistic cybercriminals within darknet marketplaces exploiting the fears\n\nof individuals impacted by the COVID pandemic. This first became evident towards the end of Q2 when\n\nthere was a global supply chain shortage in PPE, COVID test kits, and other critically needed medical\n\nitems, which were observed advertised on multiple darknet marketplaces. One example observed was\n\nthe rapid increase in Hydroxychloroquine sales postings to treat the COVID virus shortly after the United\n\nStates president was shown on news media endorsing its use.\n\nFrom Q2 to Q3 2020, the highest COVID-themed items advertised on darknet marketplaces were\n\nHydroxychloroquine and COVID test kits. CTIL Dark discovered that many vendors that changed to\n\nadvertising Hydroxychloroquine and other medical supplies on darknet marketplaces who previously\n\nsold or were still selling illegal drugs such as heroin, fentanyl, and cocaine.\n\n_Figure 6 - COVID-themed medical advertisements in the cybercriminal underground_\n\nAn example of an opportunistic cybercriminal is a darknet marketplace vendor using the pseudonym\n\n\"medsguru\" who advertised the sale of 200mg of Hydroxychloroquine, citing a BBC article that quoted\n\nPresident Trump's claims that the drug was approved in the US to treat the coronavirus. The use of\n\nreferencing legitimate media articles when advertising the sale of COVID-themed products was a\n\nrepeatable tactic observed by the CTIL Dark researchers during our monitoring of opportunistic\n\ncybercriminals.\n\n[www cti-league com](http://www.cti-league.com/) © All rights reserved to CTI League 2021\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7 - Cybercriminal persona “medsguru” advertises Hydroxycloroquine for sale on a darknet market_\n\nCTIL Dark assess that these opportunistic cybercriminals will continue to monitor and respond\n\naccordingly to the general publics' needs of the COVID pandemic. Like the Hydroxychloroquine trend,\n\nseveral other public trends emerge as long as the COVID virus remains a priority of concern to the\n\ngeneral public. These trends can emerge through media reports, public and political figures making\n\nclaims, and the spread of disinformation campaigns started by Nation-state threats.\n\n[www cti-league com](http://www.cti-league.com/) © All rights reserved to CTI League 2021\n\n\n-----\n\n### Disinformation Campaigns\n\n\nCTIL Dark has assessed during our research that disinformation, misinformation, and conspiracy theories\n\nof COVID is one of the biggest threats to the general public’s health and safety. For context, we have\n\ndefined the topic as follows:\n\n- _Misinformation is false or misleading information that’s potentially harmful. For example, a claim_\n\nthat COVID doesn’t exist. This is spread directly or indirectly by unsuspecting individuals – often\n\ntimes through sharing posts in social media.\n\n- _Disinformation is the deliberate promotion of false, misleading, or misattributed information, usually_\n\ndesigned to change the beliefs or actions of large numbers of people. This is usually created and\n\ninitially spread deliberately, often by government or intelligence agencies through the use of\n\npersonas carefully crafted to appear to have credentials of authority (Medical Doctors or PhD\n\ncredentials) or through the use of social media amplification technology (“bots”).\n\n- _Conspiracy Theories_ are misinformation which, in context, is beyond reasonable credibility.\n\nConspiracy theories can be part of Disinformation campaigns.\n\nCollection and analysis within select Tor Markets and fringe social media platforms revealed indications\n\nthat adversaries used strategic narratives to create tactical messaging. The COVID campaigns appeared\n\nto fall within three common misinformation themes: 1) Receiving the vaccine resulted in significant\n\nneurological side effects (specifically Bell’s Palsy),\n\n2) All COVID vaccines have a hidden intention of\n\nglobal depopulation, and 3) The vaccine is not\n\nneeded because other medications such as Niacin\n\nare more medically effective. These narratives\n\nreceived ongoing discussions within messaging\n\nplatforms known to incubate misinformation, such\n\nas 4Chan and 8Kun. At the same time, engagement\n\nof established personas and imposter websites\n\nwould move to target the more widely used social\n\nmedia platforms.\n\n\n_Figure 8 - Twitter post from Disinformation Persona_\n_using Bell’s Palsy photo from Medical Journal and_\n_citing imposter news site to imply the first UK Health_\n_Workers to receive the Pfizer vaccine experienced the_\n_side effect_\n\n\n_Figure 8 - Twitter post from Disinformation Persona_\n_using Bell’s Palsy photo from Medical Journal and_\n\n\n[www cti-league com](http://www.cti-league.com/) © All rights reserved to CTI League 2021\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 9 – Message board image related to campaign of hidden vaccine purpose of global depopulation_\n\n\nThe third campaign of note: the use of Niacin, was observed to be referenced and promoted highly by\n\nthe conspiracy theory group QAnon\n\nand later promoted by the same\n\ncommunity on Twitter[1]. The self\nproclaimed medical expert, “Dmitry\n\nKats, PhD, MPH” was observed to\n\nhave written several preprint\n\nmedical journals, citing them as\n\nestablished medical fact. This\n\nindividual was observed to have\n\n_Figure 10 - False Persona promoted by QAnon about the use of Niacin_\n\ncreated an elaborate backstop\n\npersona[2] that included a Google\n\nScholar account.\n\n1 Noting for this report that all findings and research mentioned regarding the conspiracy theory group QAnon was collected\nand analyzed prior to account removals as a result of the recent January 6[th], 2021 Washington DC Capitol Building insurrection\n2 “The act of creating other assets/dossier/cover/fake relationships and/or connections or documents, sites, bylines, attributions,\nor establish/augment/inflate credibility/believability” Technique 0030, from AMITT, an information security-based framework for\nresponding to disinformation.

Medical disinformation with narratives around Covid19, personal protection\n\nmeasures including masks, and anti-vaccination narratives continue. Groups like QAnon are likely to\n\ncontinue and to be joined by more groups and new groups. Since January 2021, more groups are\n\nfocused on disinformation mitigation and countermeasures, but despite that, disinformation is likely to\n\ncontinue as a technique in cyber-cognitive and physical-cognitive hybrid attacks.[3]\n\n3 Credibility Coalition: Misinformation Working Group.

As was widely reported, the COVID miracle cure sites came\n\nfirst. Scammers set these up to exploit fears and influence the individuals to click phishing links. Then\n\ncame the Tor-based COVID vaccine scam sites that urged their victims to pay in Bitcoin for their miracle\n\ncures\n\n_Figure 11 - Tor-based scam site advertising COVID vaccines for $120 in Bitcoin_\n\nThe CTI league was instrumental in taking down more than 2,000 of these scam sites since the pandemic\n\nbegan. CTIL Dark tracked the threat actors coordinating their setup on criminal forums, monitoring\n\nwhich domains they were setting up to host their fraudulent sites and reporting to the domain hosting\n\ncompanies of the violations. Our observation is that sites ending in .info were often the preferred\n\ndomain choice, as it gave the perception of the legitimacy of passing factual information on the\n\npandemic.\n\n[www cti-league com](http://www.cti-league.com/) © All rights reserved to CTI League 2021\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 12 - Product image for fake COVID treatment_\n\nCTIL Dark also took an active role in gathering intelligence and information on named threat actors.\n\nOne example is a UK national who advertised a COVID cure. CTIL Dark Intelligence Collectors reached\n\nout to the individual to gather more information. Starting in a public forum and moving the\n\nconversations to a more secure direct messaging, the actor provided enough personal information that\n\nCTIL Dark could uncover his real identity and location. CTIL Dark gave the relevant evidence to law\n\nenforcement for further action.\n\nScams tracked COVID-themed trends alongside stages of the pandemic to exploit target fear and\n\ncuriosity. From miracle cures when the virus effects were not clear, into vaccine scamming now.\n\nTherefore, the CTIL Dark assesses that scammers will continue to adapt to emerging COVID-themed\n\ntrends in 2021.\n\n[www cti-league com](http://www.cti-league.com/) © All rights reserved to CTI League 2021\n\n\n-----\n\n### Phishing \n\n\nSince the beginning of the pandemic there have been a number of different COVID-themed phishing\n\ncampaigns preying on the fears of the general public. These campaigns have included the COVID\n\nvaccine, the John Hopkins Coronavirus map and various other tempting lures to target fearful\n\nindividuals. CTIL Dark assesses with that these COVID-themed phishing campaigns will continue so long\n\nas the Coronavirus is relevant to the general public.\n\nMost are aware of the fake\n\nCOVID map that a cybercriminal\n\ngroup made to mimic the\n\noriginal Johns Hopkins map.\n\nThe original map was crucial in\n\ndisseminating information in\n\nthe opening days of the crisis.\n\nThis fake map looked the same\n\n_Figure 13 - Fake COVID map used in phishing to deliver malware_\n\nbut would infect users who\n\nvisited with AZORult malware\n\nthat steals browsing history,\n\ncookies, ID/passwords,\n\ncryptocurrency information, and\n\nother techniques. Some people\n\nmay not have known about the\n\ncreators' presence on the\n\nDarkweb and their attempts to _Figure 14 - Threat actor bragging about success of their malware campaign_\n\nresell the map and malware in\n\nvarious forms.\n\nCTIL Dark discovered the creators of the map in underground forums were ecstatic that their malware\ninfected Coronavirus map was making its round in Forbes and actively bragging about it. CTIL Dark\n\nHuman Intelligence (HUMINT) collectors engaged with the malware creators by fueling their ego to\n\nexchange for valuable intelligence. The actors bragged about who was interested in purchasing the\n\nmap, where they were from, and what they intended to do with the malware. Throughout these\n\ndiscussions, the CTIL Dark HUMINT collectors shared the information with global Law Enforcement\n\npartners and Hospital IT teams.\n\n[www cti-league com](http://www.cti-league.com/) © All rights reserved to CTI League 2021\n\n\n-----\n\n### Databases\n\n\nIn Q2, CTIL Dark identified an increase in medical Databases containing PHI being advertised within\n\nseveral underground forums and marketplaces. These databases were all obtained at one point or\n\nanother through a malicious actor stealing the contents of the database after initially breaching a\n\nmedical organization. The information within these databases can be used by threat actors in targeted\n\nattacks on the patients themselves.\n\n_Figure 15 - Cybercriminal persona “Skyscraper” advertises a database with 250,000 hospital records_\n\nIn other cases, threat actors will consolidate multiple hospital employees' data obtained from several\n\ndatabases and then sell it as one database to threat actors who may want to breach hospitals in a\n\nparticular region in the world. Malicious actors can use hospital employee information to target each\n\nemployee from many different hospitals simultaneously until they find the one that will help them gain\n\naccess to their hospital's network.\n\n_Figure 16 - Cybercriminal persona “3lv4n” advertises a database with 34,000 UAE hospital employee data_\n\nCTIL Dark assesses that the buying, selling, leaking and trading of healthcare databases that include PHI\n\nand other sensitive information on patients and medical staff will continue in 2021. Threat Actors may\n\nuse this information for immediate financial gain or as a way to find a target entry point into another\n\nmore lucrative victim organization.\n\n[www cti-league com](http://www.cti-league.com/) © All rights reserved to CTI League 2021\n\n\n-----\n\n# CTIL Dark in Action \n\nCTIL Dark has been called into action on numerous occasions. Two incidents resulted in major wins for\n\nthe CTIL Dark team, our Law Enforcement partners, and the victim organizations who were able to\n\nmitigate these threats before major damage was done. These efforts directly resulted in actionable\n\nintelligence that allowed for Law enforcement and local CERTs to assist the victim organizations that\n\nwere impacted.\n\n\n### Polish nationwide hospital alerting\n\n\nIn early June, around 1:00 a.m. Eastern Time, a CTIL Dark intelligence collector had a source contact\n\nthem regarding the sale of RDP access to a state-run hospital in Eastern Europe on the dark web for\n\n$1000. As the researcher alerted the other team members, they set forth on corroborating the threat\n\nvia other methods. Multiple sources of information were collected quickly to substantiate the Polish\n\nhospital’s vulnerability and confirm the findings. Simultaneously, a CTI League partner with the Polish\n\nComputer Emergency Response Team (CERT.PL) analyzed the data and escalated an alert to every\n\nhospital in Poland for their internal IT teams to harden the identified vulnerabilities to disrupt the RDP\n\naccess.\n\n_Figure 17 - Cybercriminal persona (redacted) advertising RDP access to a Polish hospital_\n\nFrom the initial report to disseminating the information to every state hospital in Poland, the\n\ninternational team of CTI league members took 3 hours, including finding multiple sources and\n\nintelligence types to corroborate the initial claim.\n\n[www cti-league com](http://www.cti-league.com/) © All rights reserved to CTI League 2021\n\n\n-----\n\n### Pre-empting access to large Catholic Healthcare Organization\n\n\nCTIL Dark identified a Russian-speaking threat actor on an underground fraud forum selling Remote\n\nDesktop Protocol access to one of the largest Catholic healthcare systems in the United States. The\n\nthreat actor claims that the institution has an annual revenue of $18 Billion and 86,000 employees. The\n\nadvertisement is listed at $5,000. The screenshots reveal that the threat actor could be reached via\n\nXMPP, an instant messaging platform for encrypted communications.\n\n_Figure 18 - Cybercriminal persona (redacted) advertises RDP access to a Catholic healthcare system_\n\nCTIL Dark submitted this alert to authorities and organizations affiliated with the Catholic Archdiocese\n\nand the top three Catholic healthcare organizations that matched the threat actor's description.\n\n[www cti-league com](http://www.cti-league.com/) © All rights reserved to CTI League 2021\n\n\n-----\n\n# Summary\n\nCTIL Dark, the CTI League participants, strategic partners, and law enforcement members worldwide\n\nhave created through the shared values of trust a community in which we dedicated our skills to\n\nproviding healthcare organizations worldwide with real-time intelligence on cyber threats to their\n\ninfrastructures.
