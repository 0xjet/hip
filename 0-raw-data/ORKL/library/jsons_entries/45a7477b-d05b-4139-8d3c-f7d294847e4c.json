CAS is commonly exposed to the public internet to\nenable users to access their email via mobile devices and web browsers. This exposure has\n[led to widespread exploitation by threat actors who are commonly deploying web shells to](https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2021/03/09/serious-security-webshells-explained-in-the-aftermath-of-hafnium-attacks/)\nremotely execute arbitrary code on compromised devices, similar to that seen in the\n[HAFNIUM attack.](https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2021/03/05/hafnium-advice-about-the-new-nation-state-attack/)\n\n## What should you do?\n\nWatch the video above as Mat Gangwer, head of the Sophos Managed Threat Response\n(MTR) team, shares details about the threat and offers advice about how to respond.\n\nIf you are using Microsoft Exchange server:\n\n1. Backup Exchange IIS/Server logs and ensure you have applied the July 2021 security\n\nupdates for Microsoft Exchange\n\nPatching only ensures that the vulnerability cannot be further exploited. If you\nhave already been breached, the software patches do not address post-exploit\nbehavior by a threat actor\n[2. (For non Sophos MTR customers) Identify and investigate your exposure windows for](https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2021/03/25/patching-alone-is-not-enough-investigate-your-exposure-windows/)\n\nadversarial activity\n\n[Identify and delete web shells and malicious binaries](https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2021/03/09/serious-security-webshells-explained-in-the-aftermath-of-hafnium-attacks/)\nReview process activity for instances of `w3wp.exe`\nIdentify and remove any persistence established by an actor\n3. Ensure endpoint protection is deployed on all endpoints and servers. Verify that all\n\nprotections have been enabled and your exclusions are kept to a minimum\n\n## Sophos detections\n\nSophos customers are protected by multiple detections for the exploitation of these\nvulnerabilities. They can be used by threat hunters to perform searches in their own\nenvironments. Detections include:\n\nTroj/ASPDoor-Y (detects malicious PST files)\nTroj/ASPDoor-AF (detects malicious PST files)\nTroj/Agent-BHPF\nTroj/Agent-BHQD (detects the binary component of LockFile ransomware)\nTroj/WebShel-M\nTroj/KillAV-IT\nApp/HamaKaze-A\nApp/HamaKaze-B\nCXmal/WebAgnt-A (detects malicious PST files in the context of customers’\nenvironments)\n\n\n-----\n\nSophosLabs has also published IPS signatures:\n\n**CVE** **Sophos XG/ Sophos**\n**Firewall**\n\n\n**EIPS** **SG UTM**\n\n\nCVE-202134473\n\n\n2305889, 2305807, 2305979 2305807 57906, 57907, 57908,\n57909\n\n\nIn addition, on August 24th, SophosLabs released a new, more generic signature 2305979 to\ndetect attempted vulnerability exploit in Microsoft Exchange server.\n\n[LockFile is a new ransomware family that appears to exploit the ProxyShell vulnerabilities to](https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2021/08/27/lockfile-ransomwares-box-of-tricks-intermittent-encryption-and-evasion/)\nbreach targets with unpatched, on premises Microsoft Exchange servers. SophosLabs has\nreleased additional behavior-based protection for LockFile provided by the Mem/LockFile-A\ndetection for Windows devices running Sophos endpoint and server protection managed\nthrough Sophos Central.\n\n## Determining impact with Sophos XDR\n\n### 1. Investigate exposure\n\n**Verifying current Microsoft Exchange version**\n\nTo determine whether you are running an unpatched version of Exchange or not, the below\nXDR query for live Windows devices will produce a table of Exchange servers, their current\nversion, and guidance whether they need patching or not.\n\n[The version numbers identified in the below query were gathered from this Microsoft article.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/new-features/build-numbers-and-release-dates?view=exchserver-2019)\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nSELECT DISTINCT\n 'Check Exchange Version to confirm Patch. Manually verify build number from MS\ndocumentation./' Note,\n CASE product_version \n  WHEN '15.2.922.13' THEN 'Exchange 2019 CU10 Jul21 patched against ProxyShell'\n  WHEN '15.2.922.7' THEN 'Exchange 2019 CU10 patched against ProxyShell. Recommend\nalso updating with recent July Patch.'\n  WHEN '15.2.858.15' THEN 'Exchange 2019 CU9 Jul21 patched against ProxyShell'\n  WHEN '15.2.858.12' THEN 'Exchange 2019 CU9 May21 patched against ProxyShell.\nRecommend also updating with recent July Patch.'\n  WHEN '15.1.2308.14' THEN 'Exchange 2016 CU21 Jul21 patched against ProxyShell'\n  WHEN '15.1.2308.8' THEN 'Exchange 2016 CU21 patched against ProxyShell. Recommend\nalso updating with recent July Patch.'\n  WHEN '15.1.2242.12' THEN 'Exchange 2016 CU21 Jul21 patched against ProxyShell.'\n  WHEN '15.1.2242.10' THEN 'Exchange 2016 CU20 May21 patched against ProxyShell.\nRecommend also updating with recent July Patch.'\n  WHEN '15.1.2176.14' THEN 'Exchange 2016 CU19 May21 patched against ProxyShell.\nRecommend also updating with recent July Patch.'\n  WHEN '15.0.1497.23' THEN 'Exchange 2013 CU23 Jul21 patched against ProxyShell.'\n  WHEN '15.0.1497.18' THEN 'Exchange 2013 CU23 May21 patched against ProxyShell.\nRecommend also updating with recent July Patch.'\n  ELSE 'NOT PATCHED'\n END Result,\n 'Product_Version: ' || Product_version Evidence\nFROM file \nWHERE path = \n ((\n  SELECT data FROM registry \n  WHERE key = 'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\ExchangeServer\\v15\\Setup' AND\npath =\n'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\ExchangeServer\\v15\\Setup\\MsiInstallPath'\n )||'bin\\Microsoft.Exchange.RpcClientAccess.Service.exe')\n\n```\n**Analyze IIS logs for autodiscover.json abuse**\n\nAs these vulnerabilities lie in the Exchange Client Access Service (CAS) which runs over IIS\n(web server), reviewing the IIS logs will reveal attempted and successful exploitation of the\nProxyShell vulnerabilities. HTTP requests inbound to the IIS server will be detailed including\nthe request type and path.\n\nBy default, IIS logs are written to `C:\\inetpub\\logs\\LogFiles\\`\n\nA common artifact seen in these logs for abuse of CVE-2021-34473 is the presence of\n```\n&Email=autodiscover/autodiscover.json in the request path to confuse the Exchange\n\n```\nproxy to erroneously strip the wrong part from the URL.\n\nE.g. `GET /autodiscover/autodiscover.json @evilcorp/ews/exchange.asmx?`\n```\n&Email=autodiscover/autodiscover.json%3F@evil.corp\n\n```\nThe below XDR query for live Windows devices will query the IIS logs on disk for any lines\nthat contain the string ‘autodiscover.json’.\n\n\n-----\n\nShould you later identify web shells, this same query can be repurposed to query for the web\nshell file name to reveal requests made to the web shell – simply change ‘autodiscover.json’\nto ‘webshell_name.aspx’. Please note that this query can be slow depending on the volume\nof logs it needs to parse.\n```\nSELECT grep.*\nFROM file\nCROSS JOIN grep ON (grep.path = file.path)\nWHERE\nfile.path LIKE 'C:\\inetpub\\logs\\LogFiles\\W3SVC%\\u_ex210[89]%'\nAND grep.pattern = 'autodiscover.json'\n\n```\n**Windows Events for New-MailboxExportRequest abuse**\n\nCVE-2021-31207 enables a threat actor to write files to disk by abusing a feature of the\nExchange PowerShell backend, specifically the `New-MailboxExportRequest cmdlet. This`\ncmdlet enables an email to be written to disk, using a UNC path, that contains an arbitrary\nemail attachment. This has been the primary method used to deliver a web shell to a\ncompromised device.\n\nWindows Event logs for MSExchange Management typically log usage of `New-`\n```\nMailboxExportRequest . By reviewing these logs, the locations of web shells can be\n\n```\nascertained.\n\nThe below XDR query for live Windows devices will query the Windows Event logs from the\npast 14 days for any events that detail usage of this cmdlet and the parameters of the\ncommand (including file path).\n```\nSELECT *\nFROM sophos_windows_events\nWHERE source = 'MSExchange Management'\nAND time > strftime('%s', 'now', '-14 days')\nAND data LIKE '%MailboxExportRequest%'\n\n### 2. Identify suspicious web shells and binaries\n\n```\n[Adversaries exploiting these vulnerabilities are dropping web shells on to the compromised](https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2021/03/09/serious-security-webshells-explained-in-the-aftermath-of-hafnium-attacks/)\ndevice through which they can issue additional commands such as downloading and\nexecuting malicious binaries (such as `.exe or` `.dll files).`\n\nAs these vulnerabilities lie in CAS which runs on IIS, adversarial activity will stem from a\nw3wp.exe process, a worker process for IIS.\n\n**Web shells on disk**\n\nThe below XDR query for live Windows devices looks at directories where adversaries are\ndropping web shells which may still be present on disk. Review any unexpected or recently\ncreated `.aspx files that are present in the output of the query.`\n\n\n-----\n\nE.g. `C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\aspnet_client\\654253568.aspx`\n```\nSELECT * FROM\nfile sf\nLEFT JOIN hash sh\nON sf.path = sh.path\nWHERE\nsf.path LIKE 'C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\aspnet_client\\system_web\\%.aspx'\nOR sf.path LIKE 'C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\aspnet_client\\%.aspx'\nOR sf.path LIKE 'C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft\\Exchange\nServer\\V15\\FrontEnd\\HttpProxy\\owa\\auth\\%.aspx'\nOR sf.path LIKE 'C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft\\Exchange\nServer\\V15\\FrontEnd\\HttpProxy\\ecp\\auth\\%.aspx'\nOR sf.path LIKE 'C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft\\Exchange\nServer\\V15\\FrontEnd\\HttpProxy\\owa\\auth\\current\\%.aspx'\nOR sf.path LIKE 'C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft\\Exchange\nServer\\V15\\FrontEnd\\HttpProxy\\owa\\auth\\current\\themes\\%.aspx'\nOR sf.path LIKE 'C:\\ProgramData\\%.aspx'\nOR sf.path LIKE 'C:\\ProgramData\\%\\%.aspx'\n\n```\nWith the results, you can pivot from the path column of a suspected web shell by clicking the\n```\n(…) button and selecting “File access history” to query and identify what processes have\n\n```\ninteracted with the file and which process created the file. Instances of `w3wp.exe should be`\ninvestigated to reveal further actions the adversary may have taken by pivoting from the\nsophosPID of the process, clicking the `(…) button next to the sophosPID, and selecting the`\n“Process activity history” query.\n\n**Historic web shell file creation events**\n\nAlternatively, to identify web shells that have been dropped but may have been deleted, you\ncan interrogate the Sophos process and file journals to look at historic file creations for\n```\n.aspx files in the last day by using the below XDR query for live Windows devices. To\n\n```\nincrease your hunt time range you can change ‘now’ and ‘-1 days’ to values that needs to be\ninvestigated.\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nSELECT\n CAST(datetime(sfj.time, 'unixepoch') AS TEXT) date,\n spj.processName,\n CASE sfj.eventType\n  WHEN 0 THEN 'Created'\n END eventType,\n replace(sfj.pathname, rtrim(sfj.pathname, replace(sfj.pathname, '\\', '')), '')\nfileName,\n spj.pathname processPath,\n sfj.pathname filePath,\n sfj.sophosPID\nFROM sophos_file_journal sfj\nLEFT JOIN sophos_process_journal spj\n ON spj.sophosPID = sfj.sophosPID\n AND spj.time = replace(sfj.sophosPID, rtrim(sfj.sophosPID, replace(sfj.sophosPID,\n':', '')), '')/10000000-11644473600\nWHERE sfj.time > strftime('%s', 'now', '-1 days')\n AND sfj.eventType IN (0)\n AND sfj.pathname LIKE '%.aspx';\n\n```\nSimilarly, the sophosPID of suspect processes, especially w3wp.exe, should be pivoted from\nand the process activity history reviewed to determine other actions the adversary may have\ntaken.\n\n**Modified applicationHost.config physicalPaths**\n\nThreat actors have also been observed modifying the Exchange configuration, typically\nlocated at `C:\\Windows\\System32\\inetsrv\\Config\\applicationHost.config, to add`\nnew virtual directory paths to obfuscate the location of web shells. These paths are defined\nin the config under `physicalPath parameter of a` `virtualDirectory definition. Any`\nentries for web shells should be deleted and the IIS service restarted to reload the config.\n\nThe below XDR query for live Windows devices will list all `physicalPath entries of the`\n```\napplicationHost.config file.\nSELECT grep.*\nFROM file\nCROSS JOIN grep ON (grep.path = file.path)\nWHERE\nfile.path LIKE 'C:\\Windows\\System32\\inetsrv\\Config\\applicationHost.config'\nAND grep.pattern = 'physicalPath'\n\n```\n**New and suspicious files in System32**\n\nActors have commonly been dropping malicious executables, via a web shell, to the\nSystem32 directory. Recently created .exe files and other suspicious files at this path should\nbe investigated.\n\nE.g. `C:\\Windows\\System32\\createhidetask.exe`\n\nE.g. `C:\\Windows\\System32\\ApplicationUpdate.exe`\n\n\n-----\n\nThe below XDR query for live Windows devices will list all the files currently in the System32\ndirectory.\n```\nSELECT * FROM FILE WHERE PATH LIKE 'C:\\Windows\\System32\\%'\n\n### 3. Investigate historical command executions\n\n```\n**PowerShell and cmd child processes of w3wp**\n\nAs detailed in the previous section, the presence and use of web shells will result in\ncommand executions and other suspicious activity stemming from an IIS Worker Process\n```\nw3wp.exe .\n\n```\nThe below query for the XDR Data Lake will list details of hosts where `powershell.exe or`\n```\ncmd.exe are child processes of w3wp.exe as well as detail the commands that have been\n\n```\nexecuted.\n```\nSELECT\n ingestion_timestamp,\n unix_time,\n epoch,\n meta_hostname,\n meta_ip_address,\n meta_mac_address,\n meta_os_name,\n meta_os_platform,\n meta_public_ip,\n cmdline,\n pid,\n name,\n path,\n sophos_pid,\n parent,\n parent_name,\n parent_path,\n parent_sophos_pid,\n username\nFROM\n xdr_data\nWHERE\n query_name = 'running_processes_windows_sophos'\n AND parent_name = 'w3wp.exe'\n AND (name = 'powershell.exe'\n OR name = 'cmd.exe')\n\n```\nSophos MTR has observed threat actors executing the following commands during\nProxyShell incidents which may aid you in identifying post-exploit activity.\n\nwhoami\nInvoke-WebRequest\nStart-Process\n\n\n-----\n\nping\nmkdir\nreg add\nnet user\nnet accounts\nnet localgroup\nicacls\ntakeown\ntasklist\nschtasks\n\n### 4. Locate other forms of persistence\n\n**Scheduled Tasks**\n\nSophos has observed threat actors establishing persistence on compromised devices by\ncreating scheduled tasks to periodically execute a suspicious binary. The below XDR query\nfor live Windows devices can be used to list the current Scheduled Tasks on a device which\nshould be reviewed, and any suspicious tasks investigated.\n```\nSELECT * FROM SCHEDULED_TASKS\n\n### How Sophos Managed Threat Response (MTR) can help\n\n```\nThreats such as ProxyShell are a great example of the peace of mind you get knowing your\norganization is backed by an elite team of threat hunters and incident response experts.\n\n[When the ProxyShell news broke, the Sophos MTR team immediately began to hunt and](https://www.sophos.com/en-us/products/managed-threat-response.aspx)\ninvestigate in customer environments to determine if any activity was related to the attack.\nAdditionally, they looked to uncover any new artifacts (e.g. IOCs) related to the attack that\ncould provide further protection for all Sophos customers.\n\nThe 24/7 nature of Sophos MTR meant that not a single second was wasted as we started\nhunting for evidence of abuse, ensuring our customers were protected.\n\n[Concerned about ProxyShell?
