Impacted people included university and college students and\nstaffers using “.edu” email addresses.\n\nEducational institutions are not the only organizations that financially motivated threat actors\nhave set their sights on using tax-themed lures. Proofpoint observed similar threats\nimpacting dozens of verticals from manufacturing to healthcare to energy. But this year is a\nbit different. Threat actors take advantage of every tax season by mounting tax-themed\ncampaigns that aim to steal money and sensitive information. What makes 2021 unique are\nthe continuing and unprecedented pandemic, healthcare, and financial crises that these\nthreat actors are combining with typical tax lures in the ongoing campaigns Proofpoint\nobserved.\n\nThese findings demonstrate threat actors are agile and flexible and take current events into\naccount in their campaign development to maximize their advantage and encourage victims\nto fall for their tactics.\n\nProofpoint observed over 30 tax-themed malicious email campaigns totaling over 800,000\nemail messages so far in 2021. These include attempts to compromise personal email\naccounts or steal sensitive personal data for likely financial gain. Proofpoint also observed\n[multiple campaigns aligned with business email compromise activities. Such attacks can be](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-reference/business-email-compromise)\nused to facilitate payroll fraud, costing victim organizations millions of dollars.\n\n**Campaign Trends**\n\nSo far in 2021, Proofpoint identified over 30 discrete campaigns targeting thousands of\npeople from multiple threat actors that leveraged malicious email lures associated with taxes,\ntax and refund support, and government revenue entities. At least four threat actor groups\ntracked by Proofpoint have leveraged tax-themed malicious email campaigns.\n\n\n-----\n\nCredential theft phishing attempts – which can be used to target individuals or leveraged for\nemail account takeovers – accounted for 40% of the tax-themed email campaigns, followed\n[by remote access trojan (RAT) campaigns at 17%. However, despite RATs featuring in fewer](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/threat-insight-2019-review-year-rat)\ncampaigns, they were far more popular in total message volume. Half of identified tax[themed and related messages containing malware were used to distribute the Remcos RAT,](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-reference/malware)\na commodity malware with extensive data theft and surveillance capabilities. Other broad\ntax-themed malware distribution campaigns included Dridex, TrickBot, and ZLoader.\n\n[Over the course of 2020, threat actors began increasingly leveraging Excel 4.0 (XL4) macros](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3597913/why-excel-4-0-macro-exploits-are-surging.html)\nto distribute malware, and this trend has continued in 2021. Proofpoint observed a 500%\nincrease in tax-themed email threat campaigns delivering weaponized XL4 Macros in the first\nthree months of 2021. Proofpoint assesses this is due to limited detection coverage in\nmodern security systems. (Although Microsoft still supports XL4 macros, the company\n[suggests migrating them to the latest version of Microsoft Visual Basic Application.)](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/working-with-excel-4-0-macros-ba8924d4-e157-4bb2-8d76-2c07ff02e0b8)\n\n**Campaign Samples**\n\n**TrickBot**\n\nOne of the most prolific IRS-themed malware campaigns leveraged IRS tax credit distribution\nfor employee retention lures benefiting employers impacted by COVID-19. This campaign\nidentified in March 2021 contained over 18,000 messages to over 2,000 target entities. It\ndistributed the TrickBot banking trojan. TrickBot is designed to steal banking information and\nacts as an initial payload for additional malware, gaining notoriety in 2018 for distributing\n[Ryuk ransomware which reportedly accounted for a third of ransomware distributed by many](https://www.securitymagazine.com/articles/93769-ryuk-ransomware-responsible-for-one-third-of-all-ransomware-attacks-in-2020)\nactors across the threat landscape in 2020.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1: IRS Themed Lure offering an Employ Retention Credit_\n\nUnlike typically observed activity, this TrickBot campaign distributed malicious Excel files\nleveraging the XLSB filetype, a lightweight file format that can only be opened in Excel.\nProofpoint assesses with moderate confidence the threat actor leveraged this document\nformat as it is less likely to be detected by anti-virus systems. Researchers previously\nobserved the multipurpose trojan QBot distributed via XLSB files in October 2020.\n\n**Dridex**\n\nThe threat actor Proofpoint tracks as TA575 [distributed emails purporting to be from IRS](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/security-briefs/threat-actors-target-victims-promising-covid-19-relief-vaccines-and-variant)\n[representatives associated with the American Rescue Plan. The emails contained links to](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1319/text)\ndownload Microsoft Excel documents containing macros that, when enabled, downloaded\nthe Dridex malware designed to steal banking and other personal information.\n\nAlso known as the COVID-19 Stimulus Package, the American Rescue Plan, was signed into\nlaw on 11 March 2021. The $1.9 trillion economic stimulus package aimed to provide\nfinancial relief to people and businesses in the U.S.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2: IRS Rescue Plan Lure_\n\nThe TA575 campaign, which began in early March, included almost 16,000 messages and\nimpacted over 1,800 organizations across dozens of verticals.\n\n**Consumer Credential Phishing**\n\nTax-themed phishing attacks also occur globally, and one campaign Proofpoint identified\nposed as the United Kingdom’s tax and customs authority, HM Revenue and Customs\n[(HMRC). As part of the country’s COVID-19 response, HMRC introduced multiple Self-](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/self-employment-income-support-scheme-grant-extension/self-employment-income-support-scheme-grant-extension)\nEmployment Income Support Schemes allowing people financially impacted by the pandemic\nto claim financial aid.\n\nThe malicious email campaign that began in mid-February 2021 distributed messages with\nlinks that led to a fake Self-Employment HMRC tax themed authentication page designed to\nharvest user credentials.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3: Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs Tax Refund Notification Lure_\n\n**TA574**\n\nTypical IRS-themed lures remain popular. The cybercrime actor TA574 sent almost 40,000\nmessages in one campaign using lures posing as the IRS and financial representatives.\nTA574 is an actor operating at a large scale that indiscriminately targets multiple industries\nand attempts to deliver and install malware like banking trojans. The IRS-themed emails\ncontained malicious Microsoft Excel documents that requested victims enable macros to\n[view content, thereby downloading and executing the ZLoader malware on a victim machine.](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/zloader-loads-again-new-zloader-variant-returns)\nZLoader is a typical banking malware that steals credentials and other private\ninformation from users of targeted financial institutions.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4: Internal Revenue Service Fake Case_\n\n**New Client Tax Lures**\n\nOne small campaign identified in March 2021 leverages subjects purporting to be requests\nfrom new clients or tax filing assistance. The emails begin with a benign request for tax\npreparation assistance from \"John Stevens\" and his wife. The emails target financial and\naccounting organizations in North America. If the recipient replies, they then receive a follow\nup email with a URL linking to a document that uses macros to drop a downloader that pulls\nin NetWire RAT. NetWire is typically used by criminal threat actors targeting a wide range of\norganizations including financial services, businesses, medical companies, and educational\ninstitutions.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5: Phishing themes matching previous tax-themes campaigns distributing malware._\n\n[Proofpoint researchers observed similar campaigns since 2018. Proofpoint assesses with](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/tax-themed-email-campaigns-steal-credentials-spread-banking-trojans-rats-ransomware)\nhigh confidence the same threat actor is responsible for these campaigns. This actor targets\naccounting, financial, and related industries typically around tax season.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nTax season is a popular time for threat actors to conduct email-based attack campaigns\ndesigned to steal sensitive information for financial gain. In 2021, threat actors are often\ncombining current events such as COVID-19 or healthcare themes alongside typical tax\nlures to further entice victims.\n\nTo reduce the risk of successful exploitation, Proofpoint recommends the following:\n\n\n-----\n\n**Train users to spot and report malicious email. Regular training and simulated**\nattacks can stop many attacks and help identify people who are especially vulnerable.\nThe best simulations mimic real-world attack techniques. Look for solutions that tie into\nreal-world attack trends and the latest threat intelligence.\n\n**At the same time, assume that users will eventually click some threats. Attackers**\nwill always find new ways to exploit human nature. Find a solution that spots and\nblocks inbound email threats targeting employees before they reach the inbox. Invest in\na solution can manage the entire spectrum of email threats, not just malware-based\nthreats. Some threats—including business email compromise (BEC) and other forms of\nemail fraud—can be hard to detect with conventional security tools. Your solution\nshould analyze both external and internal email—attackers may use compromised\naccounts to trick users within the same organization. Web isolation can be a critical\nsafeguard for unknows and risky URLs.\n\n**Manage access to sensitive data and insider threats. A cloud access security**\nbroker can help secure cloud accounts and help you grant the right levels of access to\nusers and third-party add-on apps based on the risk factors that matter to you. Insider\nrisk management platforms can help protect against insider threats, including users\ncompromised by external attacks.\n\n**Partner with a threat intelligence vendor. Focused, targeted attacks call for**\nadvanced threat intelligence. Leverage a solution that combines static and dynamic\ntechniques at scale to detect new attack tools, tactics, and targets—and then learns\nfrom them.\n\nSubscribe to the Proofpoint Blog\n\n\n-----",
