It can be found on the Intezer blog](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/author/the-blackberry-research-and-intelligence-team)_ **_[here as](https://www.intezer.com/blog/research/new-linux-threat-symbiote/)_**\n_well._\n\nIn biology, a symbiote is an organism that lives in symbiosis with another organism. The\nsymbiosis can be mutually beneficial to both organisms, but sometimes it can be parasitic\nwhen one benefits and the other is harmed. A few months back, we discovered a new,\nundetected malware that acts in this parasitic nature affecting Linux® operating systems.\nWe have aptly named this malware Symbiote.\n\nWhat makes Symbiote different from other Linux malware that we usually come across, is\nthat it needs to infect other running processes to inflict damage on infected machines.\nInstead of being a standalone executable file that is run to infect a machine, it is a shared\nobject (SO) library that is loaded into all running processes using LD_PRELOAD\n\n\n-----\n\n[(T1574.006), and parasitically infects the machine. Once it has infected all the running](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/006/)\nprocesses, it provides the threat actor with rootkit functionality, the ability to harvest\ncredentials, and remote access capability.\n\n### The Birth of a Symbiote\n\nOur earliest detection of Symbiote is from November 2021, and it appears to have been\nwritten to target the financial sector in Latin America. Once the malware has infected a\nmachine, it hides itself and any other malware used by the threat actor, making infections\nvery hard to detect. Performing live forensics on an infected machine may not turn anything\nup since all the file, processes, and network artifacts are hidden by the malware. In addition\nto the rootkit capability, the malware provides a backdoor for the threat actor to log in as any\nuser on the machine with a hardcoded password, and to execute commands with the\nhighest privileges.\n\nSince it is extremely evasive, a Symbiote infection is likely to “fly under the radar.” In our\nresearch, we haven’t found enough evidence to determine whether Symbiote is being used\nin highly targeted or broad attacks.\n\nOne interesting technical aspect of Symbiote is its Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) hooking\nfunctionality. Symbiote is not the first Linux malware to use BPF. For example, an advanced\n[backdoor attributed to the](https://reverse.put.as/2021/12/17/knock-knock-whos-there/) [Equation Group has been using BPF for covert communication.](https://www.pangulab.cn/files/The_Bvp47_a_top-tier_backdoor_of_us_nsa_equation_group.en.pdf)\nHowever, Symbiote utilizes BPF to hide malicious network traffic on an infected machine.\n\nWhen an administrator starts any packet capture tool on the infected machine, BPF\nbytecode is injected into the kernel that defines which packets should be captured. In this\nprocess, Symbiote adds its bytecode first so it can filter out network traffic that it doesn’t\nwant the packet-capturing software to see.\n\n### Evasion Techniques\n\nSymbiote is very stealthy. The malware is designed to be loaded by the linker via the\n**LD_PRELOAD directive. This allows it to be loaded before any other shared objects. Since**\nit is loaded first, it can “hijack the imports” from the other library files loaded for the\napplication.\n\nSymbiote uses this to hide its presence on the machine by hooking libc and libpcap\nfunctions. The image below shows a summary of the malware’s evasions.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1: Symbiote evasion techniques_\n\n### Host Activity\n\nThe Symbiote malware, in addition to hiding its own presence on the machine, also hides\nother files related to malware likely deployed with it. Within the binary, there is a file list that\nis RC4 encrypted. When hooked functions are called, the malware first dynamically loads\nlibc and calls the original function. This logic is used in all hooked functions. An example is\nshown in Figure 2 below.\n\n_Figure 2: Logic for resolving readdir from libc_\n\n\n-----\n\nIf the calling application is trying to access a file or folder under /proc, the malware scrubs\nthe output from process names that are on its list. The process names in the list below were\nextracted from the samples we have discovered.\n\ncertbotx64\ncertbotx86\njavautils\njavaserverx64\njavaclientex64\njavanodex86\n\nIf the calling application is not trying to access something under /proc, the malware instead\nscrubs the result from a file list. The files extracted from all the samples we examined are\nshown in the list below. Some of the file names match those used by Symbiote, while others\nmatch names of files suspected to be tools used by the threat actor on the infected\nmachine. The list includes the following files.\n\napache2start\napache2stop\nprofiles.php\n404erro.php\njavaserverx64\njavaclientex64\njavanodex86\nliblinux.so\njava.h\nopen.h\nmpt86.h\nsqlsearch.php\nindexq.php\nmt64.so\ncertbot.h\ncert.h\ncertbotx64\ncertbotx86\njavautils\nsearch.so\n\nOne consequence of Symbiote being loaded into processes via LD_PRELOAD is that tools\nlike ldd, a utility that prints the shared libraries required by each program, will list the\nmalware as a loaded object. To counter this, the malware hooks execve and looks for calls\nto this function with the environment variable LD_TRACE_LOADED_OBJECTS set to 1. To\nunderstand why, it’s worth looking at the manual page for ldd:\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the usual case, ldd invokes the standard dynamic linker (see ld.so(8)) with the\nLD_TRACE_LOADED_OBJECTS environment variable set to 1. This causes the dynamic\nlinker to inspect the program's dynamic dependencies, and find (according to the rules\ndescribed in ld.so(8)) and load the objects that satisfy those dependencies. For each\ndependency, ldd displays the location of the matching object and the (hexadecimal) address\nat which it is loaded. (The linux-vdso and ld-linux shared dependencies are special; see\nvdso(7) and ld.so(8).)\n\nWhen the malware detects this, it executes the loader as ldd does, but it scrubs its own\nentry from the result.\n\n### Network Activity\n\nSymbiote also has functionality to hide network activity on the infected machine. It uses\nthree different methods to accomplish this. The first method involves hooking fopen and\n**fopen64. If the calling application tries to open /proc/net/tcp, the malware creates a temp**\nfile and copies the first line to that file. After that, it scans each line for the presence of\nspecific ports. If the malware finds a port it’s searching for on a line it’s scanning, it skips to\nthe next line. Otherwise, the line is written to the temp file. Once the original file has been\ncompletely processed, the malware closes the file and returns the file descriptor of the temp\nfile back to the caller.\n\nEssentially, this gives the calling process a scrubbed result, which excludes all entries of the\nnetwork connections that the malware wants to hide.\n\nThe second method Symbiote uses to hide its network activity is by hijacking any injected\n[packet filtering bytecode. The Linux kernel uses extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) to](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/networking/filter.html)\nallow packet filtering based on rules provided from a userland process. The filtering rule is\nprovided as eBPF bytecode that the kernel executes on a virtual machine (VM). This\nminimizes the context switching between kernel and userland, providing a performance\nboost since the kernel performs the filtering directly.\n\nIf an application on the infected machine tries to perform packet filtering with eBPF,\nSymbiote hijacks the filtering process. First, it hooks the libc function setsockopt. If the\nfunction is called with the option SO_ATTACH_FILTER, which is used to perform packet\nfiltering on a socket, it prepends its own bytecode before the eBPF code provided by the\ncalling application.\n\nCode Snippet 1 shows an annotated version of the bytecode injected by one of the\nSymbiote samples. The bytecode “drops” if they match the following conditions:\n\nIPv6 (TCP or SCTP) and src port (43253 or 43753 or 63424 or 26424)\nIPv6 (TCP or SCTP) and dst port 43253\nIPv4 (TCP or SCTP) and src port (43253 or 43753 or 63424 or 26424)\nIPv4 (TCP or SCTP) and dst port (43253 or 43753 or 63424 or 26424)\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile this bytecode only drops packets based on ports, we have also observed filtering of\ntraffic based on IPv4 addresses. In all cases, the filtering operates on both inbound and\noutbound traffic from the machine, to hide both directions of the traffic. If the conditions are\nnot met, it just jumps to the start of the bytecode provided by the calling application.\n\nThe bytecode extracted from one of the samples, as shown in Code Snippet 1, consists of\n32 instructions. This code can’t be injected into the kernel on its own, because it assumes\nthat more bytecode exists after it. There are a few jumps in this bytecode that skip to the\nbeginning of the bytecode provided by the calling process. Without the caller’s bytecode,\nthe injected bytecode would jump out-of-bounds, which is not allowed by the kernel.\nBytecode like this either has to be handwritten or by patching compiler generated-bytecode.\nEither option suggests that this malware was written by a skilled developer.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n_Code Snippet 1: Annotated bytecode extracted from one of the Symbiote samples_\n\nThe third method Symbiote uses to hide its network traffic is to hook libpcap functions. This\nmethod is used by the malware to filter out UDP traffic to domain names it has in a list. It\nhooks the functions pcap_loop and pcap_stats to accomplish this task. For each packet\nthat is received, Symbiote checks the UDP payload for substrings of the domains it wants to\nfilter out. If it finds a match, the malware ignores the packet and increments a counter. The\n**pcap_stats uses this counter to “correct” the number of packets processed by subtracting**\nthe counter value from the true number of packets processed. If a packet payload does not\ncontain any of the strings it has in its list, the original callback function is called. This\nmethod is used to filter out UDP packets, while the bytecode method is used to filter out\nTCP packets. By using all three of these methods, the malware ensures that all traffic is\nhidden.\n\n### Symbiote Objectives\n\nThe malware's objective, in addition to hiding malicious activity on the machine, is to\nharvest credentials and to provide remote access for the threat actor. The credential\nharvesting is performed by hooking the libc read function. If an ssh or scp process is\ncalling the function, it captures the credentials. The credentials are first encrypted with RC4\nusing an embedded key, and then written to a file. For example, one of the versions of the\nmalware writes the captured credentials to the file /usr/include/certbot.h.\n\nIn addition to storing the credentials locally, the credentials are exfiltrated. The data is hex\nencoded and chunked up to be exfiltrated via DNS address (A) record requests to a domain\nname controlled by the threat actor. The A record request has the following format:\n\n_Code Snippet 2: Structure of DNS request used by Symbiote to exfiltrate data_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware checks if the machine has a nameserver configured in /etc/resolv.conf. If it\ndoesn’t, Google’s DNS (8.8.8.8) is used. Along with sending the request to the domain\nname, Symbiote also sends it as a UDP broadcast.\n\nRemote access to the infected machine is achieved by hooking a few Linux Pluggable\nAuthentication Module (PAM) functions. When a service tries to use PAM to authenticate a\nuser, the malware checks the provided password against a hardcoded password. If the\npassword provided is a match, the hooked function returns a success response. Since the\nhooks are in PAM, it allows the threat actor to authenticate to the machine with any service\n[that uses PAM. This includes remote services such as Secure Shell (SSH).](https://www.openssh.com/)\n\nIf the entered password does not match the hardcoded password, the malware saves and\nexfiltrates it as part of its keylogging functionality. Additionally, the malware sends a DNS\nTXT record request to its command-and-control (C2) domain. The TXT record has the\nformat of %MACHINEID%.%C2_DOMAIN%. If it gets a response, the malware base64\ndecodes the content, checks if the content has been signed by a correct ed25519 private\nkey, decrypts the content with RC4, and executes the shell script in a spawned bash\nprocess. This functionality can operate as a break-glass method for regaining access to the\nmachine in case the normal process doesn’t work.\n\nOnce the threat actor has authenticated to the infected machine, Symbiote provides a way\nfor the actor to gain root privileges. When the shared object is first loaded, it checks for the\nenvironment variable HTTP_SETTHIS. If the variable is set with content, the malware\nchanges the effective user and group ID to the root user, and then clears the variable before\nexecuting the content via the system command.\n\n[This process requires that the SO has the setuid permission flag set. Once the system](https://linux.die.net/man/1/chmod)\ncommand has exited, Symbiote also exits the process, to prevent the original process from\nexecuting. Figure 3 below shows the code executed. This allows for spawning a root shell\nby running HTTP_SETTHIS=”/bin/bash -p” /bin/true as any user in a shell.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3: Logic used to execute a command with root privileges_\n\n### Network Infrastructure\n\nThe domain names used by the Symbiote malware are impersonating some major Brazilian\nbanks. This suggests that these banks or their customers are the potential targets. Using\nthe domain names utilized by the malware, we managed to uncover a related sample that\nwas uploaded to VirusTotal with the name certbotx64. This file name matches one of those\nlisted as a file to hide in one of the Symbiote samples we originally obtained. The file was\n[identified as an open-source DNS tunneling tool called dnscat2.](https://github.com/iagox86/dnscat2)\n\nThe sample had a configuration in the binary that used the git[.]bancodobrasil[.]dev\ndomain as its C2 server. During the months of February and March, this domain name\nresolved to an IP address that is linked to Njalla’s Virtual Private Server (VPS) service.\nPassive DNS records showed that the same IP address was resolved to\n**ns1[.]cintepol[.]link and ns2[.]cintepol[.]link a few months earlier. Cintepol is an**\n[intelligence portal provided by the Federal Police of Brazil. The portal allows police officers](http://www.seplag.mt.gov.br/index.php?pg=ver&id=300&c=38)\nto access different databases provided by the federal police as part of their investigations.\nThe nameserver used for this impersonating domain name was active from the middle of\nDecember 2021 to the end of January 2022.\n\n\n-----\n\nAlso starting in February of 2022, the name servers for the domain caixa[.]wf were pointing\nto another Njalla VPS IP. Figure 4 below shows a timeline of these events. In addition to the\nnetwork infrastructure, the timestamps of when the files were submitted to VirusTotal are\nincluded. These three Symbiote samples were uploaded by the same submitter from Brazil.\nIt appears that the files were submitted to VirusTotal before the infrastructure went online.\n\nGiven that these files were submitted to VirusTotal prior to the infrastructure going online,\nand because some of the samples included rules to hide local IP addresses, it is possible\nthat the samples were submitted to VirusTotal to test antivirus (AV) detection before being\nused. Additionally, a version that appears to be under development was submitted at the\nend of November from Brazil, further suggesting VirusTotal was being used by the threat\nactor or group behind Symbiote for detection testing.\n\n_Figure 4: Timeline showing when files were submitted to VirusTotal and when network_\n_infrastructure went active_\n\n### Similarity to Other Malware\n\nSymbiote appears to be designed for both credential stealing and to provide remote access\nto infected Linux servers. Symbiote is not the first Linux malware developed for this goal. In\n[2014, ESET released an in-depth analysis of Ebury, an OpenSSH backdoor that also](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2014/02/21/an-in-depth-analysis-of-linuxebury/)\nperforms credential stealing. There are some similarities in the techniques used by both\nmalware families. Both use hooked functions to capture credentials and exfiltrate the\ncaptured data as DNS requests. However, the authentication method to the backdoor used\nby the two malware families is different. When we first analyzed the samples with Intezer\nAnalyze, only unique code was detected (Figure 5). As no code is shared between\nSymbiote and Ebury/Windigo or any other known malware, we can confidently conclude\nthat Symbiote is a new, undiscovered Linux malware.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5: Intezer_ _[analysis of a Symbiote sample showing only genes classified as Symbiote](https://analyze.intezer.com/files/ec67bbdf55d3679fca72d3c814186ff4646dd779a862999c82c6faa8e6615180)_\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSymbiote is a malware that is highly evasive. Its main objective is to capture credentials and\nto facilitate backdoor access to infected machines. Since the malware operates as a\nuserland level rootkit, detecting an infection may be difficult. Network telemetry can be used\nto detect anomalous DNS requests, and security tools such as antivirus and endpoint\ndetection and response (EDR) should be statically linked to ensure they are not “infected”\nby userland rootkits.\n\n### Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)\n\n**Hashes**\n\n**Hash** **Notes**\n\n\n[121157e0fcb728eb8a23b55457e89d45d76a](https://analyze.intezer.com/files/121157e0fcb728eb8a23b55457e89d45d76aa3b7d01d3d49105890a00662c924)\n[a3b7d01d3d49105890a00662c924](https://analyze.intezer.com/files/121157e0fcb728eb8a23b55457e89d45d76aa3b7d01d3d49105890a00662c924)\n\n[f55af21f69a183fb8550ac60f392b05df14aa01](https://analyze.intezer.com/files/f55af21f69a183fb8550ac60f392b05df14aa01d7ffe9f28bc48a118dc110b4c)\n[d7ffe9f28bc48a118dc110b4c](https://analyze.intezer.com/files/f55af21f69a183fb8550ac60f392b05df14aa01d7ffe9f28bc48a118dc110b4c)\n\n[ec67bbdf55d3679fca72d3c814186ff4646dd7](https://analyze.intezer.com/files/ec67bbdf55d3679fca72d3c814186ff4646dd779a862999c82c6faa8e6615180)\n[79a862999c82c6faa8e6615180](https://analyze.intezer.com/files/ec67bbdf55d3679fca72d3c814186ff4646dd779a862999c82c6faa8e6615180)\n\n\n“kerneldev.so.bkp.” Appears to be an\nearly development build.\n\n“mt64_.so.” Missing credential\nexfiltration over DNS.\n\n“search.so.” First sample with\ncredential exfiltration of DNS.\n\n\n-----\n\n[a0cd554c35dee3fed3d1607dc18debd1296fa](https://analyze.intezer.com/files/a0cd554c35dee3fed3d1607dc18debd1296faaee29b5bd77ff83ab6956a6f9d6)\n[aee29b5bd77ff83ab6956a6f9d6](https://analyze.intezer.com/files/a0cd554c35dee3fed3d1607dc18debd1296faaee29b5bd77ff83ab6956a6f9d6)\n\n[45eacba032367db7f3b031e5d9df10b30d016](https://analyze.intezer.com/files/45eacba032367db7f3b031e5d9df10b30d01664f24da6847322f6af1fd8e7f01)\n[64f24da6847322f6af1fd8e7f01](https://analyze.intezer.com/files/45eacba032367db7f3b031e5d9df10b30d01664f24da6847322f6af1fd8e7f01)\n\n### Ports Hidden\n\n45345\n34535\n64543\n24645\n47623\n62537\n43253\n43753\n63424\n26424\n\n### Domains Hidden\n\nassets[.]fans\ncaixa[.]cx\ndpf[.]fm\nbancodobrasil[.]dev\ncctdcapllx0520\ncctdcapllx0520[.]df[.]caixa\nwebfirewall[.]caixa[.]wf\ncaixa[.]wf\n\n### Process Names Hidden\n\njavaserverx64\njavaclientex64\njavanodex86\napache2start\napache2stop\n\n[watchdog/0]\ncertbotx64\ncertbotx86\njavautils\n\n### File Names Hidden\n\n\n“liblinux.so.”\n\n“certbotx64.” dnscat2\n\n\n-----\n\napache2start\napache2stop\nprofiles.php\n404erro.php\njavaserverx64\njavaclientex64\njavanodex86\nliblinux.so\njava.h\nopen.h\nmpt86.h\nsqlsearch.php\nindexq.php\nmt64.so\ncertbot.h\ncert.h\ncertbotx64\ncertbotx86\njavautils\nsearch.so\n\n### Credential Exfil Domains\n\n*.x3206.caixa.cx\n*.dev21.bancodobrasil.dev\n\n## About Dr. Joakim Kennedy\n\n\n-----\n\n[Dr. Joakim Kennedy is a Security Researcher analyzing malware and tracking threat actors](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joakimkennedy/)\non a daily basis.
