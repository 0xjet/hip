The ELF file is similar to](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format)\n[several executables that have been reported to belong to the Lazarus cybercrime group. (For](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazarus_Group)\n[more on Lazarus, read this post from our Advanced Threat Research Team.)](https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/mcafee-labs/lazarus-cybercrime-group-moves-to-mobile)\n\nThe malware poses as a legitimate APK, available from Google Play, for reading the Bible in\nKorean. The legit app has been installed more than 1,300 times. The malware has never\nappeared on Google Play, and we do not know how the repackaged APK is spread in the\nwild.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1: Description of the legitimate app on Google Play._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2: An overview of the malware’s operation._\n\n## Comparing Certificates\n\nThe repackaged APK has been signed by a different certificate from the legitimate APK. We\ncan see the differences in the following two screen captures:\n\n_Figure 3: The certificate of the malicious, repackaged APK._\n\n_Figure 4: The certificate of the legitimate APK._\n\nOnce the malicious APK installs its code, it attempts to execute the backdoor ELF from\n“assets/while.” If the ELF successfully executes, it turns the device into a bot.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5. The main function for executing the backdoor ELF._\n\n## Analyzing the Backdoor\n\nOnce the backdoor ELF starts, it turns into a zombie process to protect itself. It remains as a\nzombie even if the parent process terminates, as long as the “dex” execute() method has\nbeen implemented successfully.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6. The malware turns itself into a zombie process._\n\nThe malware contains a list of IP addresses of control servers. The list is encoded and\nwritten to the file /data/system/dnscd.db.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe preceding table lists information for each of the IP addresses. None of these is available\nnow.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7. The flow of writing the encoded control server IPs to a file._\n\nThe IP address array is encoded by a simple routine when it is loaded into memory from the\nread-only data section; that encoded data is written to the file /data/system/dnscd.db. The\ndecoded file is then loaded into memory to select an IP address to connect to.\n\nOne of control servers is selected randomly immediately before the backdoor process\nattempts to connect to its address. The attempt is performed repeatedly to successfully\nconnect with one of the control servers.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8. The malware creates a socket and connects to a randomly selected control server._\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce connected with a control server, the malware begins to fill the buffer using a callback\nbeacon. Figure 9 shows a part of the message-generating code. Several fields of the packet\nare hardcoded, particularly the bytes at offsets 0, 4, and 5. After we realized that the\nmessage only pretended to use the SSL handshake protocol, we understood the meaning of\nthe hardcoded bytes. The byte at offset 0 is the handshake type; offsets 4 and 5 are the SSL\nversion of the handshake layer, a part of transport layer security.\n\n_Figure 9. A part of the function for generating a callback beacon._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 10. Transferring data to be used as the callback beacon to the control server._\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter the message is generated, it sends the following packet (Figure 11) to the control server\nas a callback beacon. There is a randomly selected well-known domain in the packet where\nthe server name indicator field is placed as a field of extension data. We suspect this is an\nevasion technique to avoid detection by security solutions looking for suspicious behaviors.\n\n_Figure 11. A captured packet from the callback beacon._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 12. The list of legitimate (well-known) domains in the binary._\n\nAfter sending the callback beacon, the malware assigns global variables that contain device\ninformation which is transferred to the control server once it receives the command code\n0x5249. Figure 13 shows the jump table for implementing commands and its pseudo code.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 13. The jump table for implementing commands from the control server and the_\n_structure for receiving data._\n\n\n-----\n\nThe functions are described in the following table. Command code and arguments arrive as\nstructured data from the control server, as shown in Figure 13. The command code and\narguments are assigned, respectively, to the CMD and DATA member variables of the\nreceived data structure.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nAfter performing commands received from the control server, the malware returns the results\nto the control server using the codes in Figures 14 and 15. Before transferring the results,\nthe return code and data are stored in a structure described in the following pseudo code.\n\n_Figures 14 and 15. The codes and data structure returned to the control server._\n\n## Similarities to Lazarus Malware\n\nIn Figure 16, the function on the left is from the backdoor ELF we have analyzed. On the\nright, we see procedures found in several executables used by the Lazarus Group in various\nattacks.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 16. Similar functions to the executable used in the Sony Pictures attack._\n\nBoth functions look very similar. And the hexadecimal seeds for generating a key for\nencryption and decryption are the same. Both functions are also used to generate a\nmessage encryption and decryption key between the victim and control server. Figure 17\nshows the functions of both the backdoor ELF and an executable recently used by the\nLazarus Group. The function connects to the control server, and generates a disguised SSL\nClientHello packet. Then the generated packet is sent to the control server as callback\nbeacon.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 17. The functions to establish a connection to the control server (ELF on the left)._\n\nThe function in Figure 18 generates a disguised ClientHello packet to use as a callback\nbeacon.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 18. Generating the disguised ClientHello packet (ELF on the left)._\n\nBoth backdoors use same protocol, as we confirmed when analyzing the function for\nreceiving a message from the control server. Figure 19 shows the protocol for transferring a\nmessage between the backdoor and the control server.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 19. The receive message function included in the checking protocol (ELF on the left)._\n\nTo transfer a message from the source, the malware first sends a five-byte message to the\ndestination. The message contains information on the size of the next packet, a hardcoded\nvalue, and the type of message. The hardcoded value is 0x0301 and the type of message\ncan be between 0x14–0x17. The message type can also be used to check the validation of\nthe received packet. The following is pseudo code from the receive function:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 20. The five-byte packet sent before the source sends its primary message._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 21. Pseudo code from the receive message function._\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe security industry keeps an eye on the Lazarus Group, and McAfee Mobile Security\nresearchers actively monitor for mobile threats by Lazarus and other actors. We compared\nour findings with the threat intelligence research of our Advanced Threat Research team,\nwhich studies several groups and their techniques. Due to the reuse of recent campaign\ninfrastructure, code similarities, and functions such as the fake transport layer security, these\ntactics match many we have observed from the Lazarus Group.\n\nWe do not know if this is Lazarus’ first activity on a mobile platform. But based on the code\nsimilarities we can say it with high confidence that the Lazarus Group is now operating in the\nmobile world.\n\nMcAfee Mobile Security detects this malware as “Android/Backdoor.” Always keep your\nmobile security application updated to the latest version. And never install applications from\nunverified sources. This habit will reduce the risk of infection by malware.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise:\n\n**_Hashes_**\n\n\n-----\n\n12cc14bbc421275c3c6145bfa186dff\n\n24f61120946ddac5e1d15cd64c48b7e6\n\n8b98bdf2c6a299e1fed217889af54845\n\n9ce9a0b3876aacbf0e8023c97fd0a21d\n\n**_Domains_**\n\nmail[.]wavenet.com.ar\n\nvmware-probe[.]zol.co.zw\n\nwtps[.]org\n\n**_IP addresses_**\n\n110[.]45.145.103\n\n114[.]215.130.173\n\n119[.]29.11.203\n\n124[.]248.228.30\n\n139[.]196.55.146\n\n14[.]139.200.107\n\n175[.]100.189.174\n\n181[.]119.19.100\n\n197[.]211.212.31\n\n199[.]180.148.134\n\n217[.]117.4.110\n\n61[.]106.2.96\n\n[McAfee Blog Archives](https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/author/mcafee/)\nWe're here to make life online safe and enjoyable for everyone.\n\n## More from McAfee Labs\n\n\n-----\n\n[Crypto Scammers Exploit: Elon Musk Speaks on Cryptocurrency](https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/crypto-scammers-exploit-talk-on-cryptocurrency/%20)\n\nBy Oliver Devane Update: In the past 24 hours (from time of publication) McAfee has\nidentified 15...\n\nMay 05, 2022 |  4 MIN READ\n\n[Instagram Credentials Stealer: Disguised as Mod App](https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/instagram-credentials-stealer-disguised-as-mod-app/%20)\n\nAuthored by Dexter Shin McAfee’s Mobile Research Team introduced a new Android\nmalware targeting Instagram users who...\n\nMay 03, 2022 |  4 MIN READ\n\n[Instagram Credentials Stealers: Free Followers or Free Likes](https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/instagram-credentials-stealers-free-followers-or-free-likes/%20)\n\nAuthored by Dexter Shin Instagram has become a platform with over a billion monthly active\nusers.
