    "plain_text": "# Vidar Info-Stealer Abusing Game Platform\n\n**asec.ahnlab.com/en/22932/**\n\nMay 24, 2021\n\nThe ASEC analysis team has recently found out that the Vidar info-stealer malware is\nabusing a game matching program named Faceit to create C&C server URL. Vidar is\nmalware that has been steadily distributed from the past disguised as spam mail, PUP, and\nKMSAuto authentication tool.\n\nBefore it performs info-stealing activities, it connects to C&C server to receive commands\nand download additional DLL files to collect user information. In the past, the malware simply\nconnected to C&C server and received commands and additional files like other malware.\nYet the recent Vidar abuses online gaming platforms to actually create C&C server.\n\nFaceit is a platform which supports game matching for online game users. It supports various\nonline games such as PLAYERUNKNOWN’S BATTLEGROUNDS, DOTA 2, and Counter\nStrike: Global Offensive.\n\n\n-----\n\nList of games supported by Faceit\nAs for Vidar abusing the platform, it first creates an API URL for faceit.com before\ncommunicating with the C&C server. The URL created by the routine shown below is as\nfollows: ‘sslamlssa’ is the attacker’s Faceit ID.\n\n– hxxps://api.faceit[.]com/core/v1/nicknames/sslamlssa\n\n\n-----\n\nRoutine for\n\ncreating C&C URL\nWhen Vidar requests HTTP GET for the URL shown above, it receives the json format data\nfrom faceit.com. The malware parses the ‘about’ part in the data, which is the actual URL for\nthe C&C server.\n\n– hxxp://188.34.193[.]205\n\n\n-----\n\nData received from faceit.com\n\nAPI result for the malicious user\n\nWhen logged in to faceit.com, the malware’s C&C server address is shown in the ABOUT\npart of the profile page of the user ‘sslamlssa’.\n\n\n-----\n\nMalicious user’s profile\nIf the attacker edits the About part and enters another address, the Vidar info-stealer will\nconnect to the changed C&C server and continue to perform malicious activities. If Faceit’s\nattacker account is not blocked, the attacker can repeatedly edit the C&C server to make the\nsame malware connect to different C&C servers. It is likely that the attacker is using the\nmethod to bypass network detection for the C&C URL.\n\nVidar connects to the actual C&C servers established and receives DLL files needed for\ncommands and info-stealing, and ultimately sends the stolen information to the C&C server.\nSee the data sent below, which shows that Vidar’s version is v38.6.\n\nVidar’s network behavior\nWhen a suspicious-looking email arrives, users should not open the attachment file, try to\nuse a genuine software at all times, and refrain from using suspicious websites and P2P.\nAlso, update V3 to the latest version so that malware infection can be prevented.\n\nAhnLab’s anti-malware software, V3, detects and blocks the malware using the following\naliases:\n\n**[File Detection]**\n\n– Trojan/Win.Generic.C4452995 (2021.05.06.01)\n\n\n-----\n\n**[Behavior Detection]**\n– Malware/MDP.Behavior.M1965\n– Malware/MDP.Inject.M3034\n– Malware/MDP.Behavior.M3108\n\n**[IOC]**\n**File**\n5a9c15ad92f14ce0b36726ccd4eb4ef7\n\n**C&C**\n– hxxps://api.faceit[.]com/core/v1/nicknames/sslamlssa\n– hxxp://188.34.193[.]205\n\n[Categories:Malware Information](https://asec.ahnlab.com/en/category/malware-information/)\n\n[Tagged as:Battleground,](https://asec.ahnlab.com/tag/battleground/) [Counter Strike,](https://asec.ahnlab.com/tag/counter-strike/) [FaceIt,](https://asec.ahnlab.com/tag/faceit/) [InfoStealer,](https://asec.ahnlab.com/en/tag/infostealer-en/) [vidar](https://asec.ahnlab.com/en/tag/vidar-en/)\n\n\n-----",
