    "plain_text": "# Dragon Messenger\n\n- Background of “ Dragon Messenger” APT Operation\n\nESRC (ESTsecurity Security Response Center) has recently discovered the\nstealthy mobile APT attack carried out by Geumseong121 APT hacking group.\n\nThe hacker group also distributed a malicious app (APK) via the site disguised\nas a fundraising service for supporting North Korean defectors.\n\nThe website is built on WordPress platform, and the domain was created on\nAugust 23, 2019, and updated on October 22.\n\nThe snapshots displayed from September 11 to October on the timeline\nindicates that it is the charity site supporting North Korean defectors, and the\nAndroid app installation link (Google Play) was added in October.\n\nThe site disguised as a charity website tricks North Korean defectors and North\nKorea- related organizations into installing the apps using the promotion\nstrategies in many different forms.\n\nESRC has named the operation \"Dragon Messenger\" based on the several\ninteresting factors found in the campaign, such as the malicious application\nthat collects the data via the 'DragonTask' path and the attack performed by\ndisguised as a secure messenger.\n\n\n-----\n\n[ Figure 1] The sites disguised as fundraising organizations supporting North\nKorean defectors\n\nSince the above fundraising sites for supporting North Korean defectors were\nmade, they have been spread via various channels (email, SNS) along with\nguidelines of the related apps, mainly targeting those who work in the North\nKorea- related field.\n\nBesides, it became known to the public with the promotion using the comments\nwritten by the ID 'David Kim' who introduces himself as the administrator of the\nwebsite that is related to the North Korea- related field.\n\n\n-----\n\n[ Figure 2] Comments posted on media site covering North Korea- related\nissues\n\nMany words and expressions written in North Korean were found during the\nwebsite investigation process. It is highly likely that such expressions exist in\nreality because it is a North Korean defector- related site.\n\nESRC has conducted a thorough investigation on the YouTube site run by the\nsame administrators as those of the Android apps that were distributed on the\nsite when two apps were registered on the official Google Play Store, all of\nwhich have currently been removed by Google.\n\nThe application informs that North Korean defectors can share their life- related\nissues, get the support they need, and specify donation services.\n\n\n-----\n\n[ Figure 3] Application registered on Google Play\n\nIn the application image displayed in the official Google Play Market, there is\n'계정 창조 (North Korean expression, which means creating an account)'\nbutton. For reference, this is usually referred to as \"계정 생성 (South Korean\nexpression, which means creating an account)\" in South Korea. That is, both\n‘ 창조’ and ‘ 생성’ mean ‘creation’ in English.\n\nAlso, the only Wi- Fi connection was likely used for performing a screenshot\ncapture, which seems to be because the SIM card was not inserted on the\nsmartphone.\n\n\n-----\n\n[ Figure 4] Some of the images registered on Google Play\n\nCosmosfarm- based board for posting social comments had been included on\nthe site until October 23, but the bulletin board was removed around October\n28. The deleted board had YouTube links and comments saying that the writers\nprefer the site.\n\n\n-----\n\n[ Figure 5] Use of the app registered on YouTube\n\nYouTube videos to show how to use the Korean smartphone provides\ninformation on the installation of the application and the guidance on how to\nuse the installed application. The attacker performs malicious activities on\nFacebook with the same account as YouTube, with about 330 friends\nregistered.\n\nThis suggests that attackers have prepared the attack in advance using\nFacebook, and the registered friends can be exposed to a potential threat.\n\n\n-----\n\n[ Figure 6] Registered on Facebook\n\nThe YouTube video shows a demo of installing an application on the\nsmartphone. Taking a closer look at scenes from the video reveals that the\nhacker logged in with the name 'Lee Mi- Kyung' and the account 'borisanatoly'\nwhen creating the video.\n\n‘Lee Mi- Kyung’ is the first person who wrote a post in an app service on\nSeptember 20, 2019, at 14:10.\n\nThe 'David Kim' account, possibly the administrator of the website, posted\nseveral comments on September 20 at 14:20. It seems that the attacker posted\nthe comments that appeared as the conversation between two persons using\nthe two different accounts every 10 minutes.\n\nAlso, the name 'Lee Mi Kyung' left on the information on the official Google\nPlay app indicates that two accounts were closely related from the beginning\nand that one person managed both accounts.\n\n\n-----\n\n[ Figure 7] Conversation between the two different accounts in the app service\n\nThe APT hacker planned a highly strategic tactic scenario to gather the attack\ntargets by developing the community- based charity app for North Korean\ndefectors.\n\nGathering North Korean defectors in the specific cyberspace enabled the\nhackers secretly spy on the defectors’ conversation as well as create monetary\nprofit by collecting donations and promoting the site with advertisements.\n\nESRC believes that such malicious activities of the Geumseong121 hacker\ngroup will be the signal ‘a new mobile threat’ in the future.\n\n- Smart threat disguised as a charity site for supporting North Korean\ndefectors\n\n\n-----\n\nThe hacker group behind the attack created and distributed the multiple\nmalicious apps, and disguised them as the messengers mainly used for secret\nchats.\n\nOne of the apps disguised as sponsoring North Korean defectors was officially\nregistered in the official Google Play market. When joining the membership of\nthe site using the email account except for Kakao or Naver, the username and\npassword entered by the user using the 'createUserWithEmailAndPassword'\nmethod will be used to create the account 'Firebase' and log in to the site.\n\nIn addition, the account information is stored in plain text in the 'config.xml' file\nin the 'shared_prefs' path of the app, exposing users to the potential security\nthreats.\n\n[ Figure 8] Login credentials stored in plain text\n\nESRC focused on collecting the additional threat evidences in addition to the\npossibility of account disclosure threats upon initial SignUp, regarding the latest\nversion registered on Google Play's official market, and found other similar\ncodes in the analyzing process.\n\nWe also found a connection between the recently found campaign and the\nprevious mobile infringement by Geumseong 121 APT hacker group during the\nanalyzing process of the additional codes.\n\n- Targeted attack using KakaoTalk message\n\n\n-----\n\nMany malicious apps that attempts an installation have been detected from\nJune 2019 until recently.\n\nThe attackers steal the names and profile images of certain people who live in\nthe United States, create their KakaoTalk accounts, and attempt to access to\nSouth Koreans who are working in the North Korea- related field.\n\nKakaoTalk users can add friends only with their phone numbers, which could\nhelp the attackers to abuse the list of phone numbers to select attack targets.\n\nThe attacker attempts to impersonate a vice president and an advisory board of\nThe Korean American Association, or a researcher at the Institute of Peace.\n\n[ Figure 9] Distribution of malicious apps using KakaoTalk Messenger\n\n\n-----\n\nThe attacker pretends to be the researcher at the Institute of Peace in the US in\nKakaoTalk dialogue, tricks victims into believing that he has been collecting the\nNorth Korea- related information, and suggests the conversation with a secure\nmessenger app while encouraging users to click the specific URL link to install\na malicious app disguised as messenger app.\n\nThe attacker has disguised himself as secured messengers, such as the\n‘Threema’ developed in Swiss and ‘Wickr ‘ made in the US.\n\nThe malicious apps provide most of the functions that a normal secure\nmessenger has, to avoid users’ suspicion and all of these apps perform similar\nfunctions.\n\nThe apps are highly similar to the Android malicious apps found in the\n‘Geumsoeng121 APT hacker group performing the attack targeting smartphones\nusing the steganography technique' released on August 5.\n\n[ Figure 10] Comparison of internal codes by malicious app type\n\n\n-----\n\nThe investigation reveals that the victims of malicious apps disguised as\noverseas secure messengers were also exposed to the attack disguised as the\ncharity site supporting North Korean defectors.\n\nThe same functions were found in an earlier version of a malicious app, but not\nin the final version found in the official Google Play market.\n\n\n-----\n\n[ Figure 11] Comparison of the malwares disguised as a secure messenger and\nthe charity site for NK defectors\n\n\n-----\n\nIt seems that the attackers made and effort to avoid the suspicion that the\nNorth Korean fundraising apps are originated from the previously discovered\nmalicious apps.\n\nHowever, the initial version of those malicious apps includes the functionality\nthat attempts to communicate with Dropbox and Yandex.\n\nWe also found that some variable declarations used by malicious apps are\nalmost identical to the previously found malicious apps.\n\n\n-----\n\n[ Figure 12] Comparison of Configuration Variables of the apps disguised as a\nsecure messenger and the charity site for NK defectors\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition, we have gained many artifacts to show that the two malwares have\nhigh similarity in the path that the attackers used for performing malicious\ncommands, the data they stolen, and the additionally downloaded data.\n\n- Eavesdropping attacks using Android smartphone\n\nESRC is paying attention to investigate the threat activities of the statesponsored APT hacking group 'Geumseong121' targeting Android smartphone\nusers.\n\nThe ‘zombied’ smartphones, which are exploited in cyber operations, has\nemerged as an important threat that should not be overlooked.\n\nSeveral attempts to steal SMS and phone address books, eavesdrop on a\nphone conversation and leak the KakaoTalk messages appearing in the\nnotification window have been discovered until recently.\n\nIt is also worth noting that the quite popular celebrities have been exposed to\nthe 'Dragon Messenger' APT attack.\n\nWhen an Android smartphone is exposed to mobile threat, not only personal\nprivacy, but also the contents of institutional and corporate meetings and\nphotos in the gallery will be leaked in real time.\n\nESRC has found that many smartphone users in a wide range of fields have been\n‘zombied’ in the tracking and analyzing process of the mobile APT attack. It was\nquite surprising that most of the victims are unaware of the infection and the\ninfected smartphones have been monitored by attackers for a long period.\n\n- Indicator of Compromise\n\n1594679f51bdebe4701d062f3c8f0dc3\n\ndfb8e001b3ecfc63200dd4c5c21f53d5\n\n02d5e68bef32871765b7e6e71f50499d\n\nc36de50fe488e5015a58a241eb9b2411\n\n1e32cd693a0dd137959b87ca359b2831\n\n\n-----\n\nESRC will provide additional Indicators of Compromise (IoC) of the threat via\n'Threat Inside' threat intelligence report.\n\n\n-----",
