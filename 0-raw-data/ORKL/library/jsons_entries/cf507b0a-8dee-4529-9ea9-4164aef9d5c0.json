    "plain_text": "# Taking Action Against Hackers in Palestine\n\n**[about.fb.com/news/2021/04/taking-action-against-hackers-in-palestine/](https://about.fb.com/news/2021/04/taking-action-against-hackers-in-palestine/)**\n\nApril 7, 2022\n\nToday, we’re sharing actions we took against two separate groups of hackers in Palestine —\na network linked to the Preventive Security Service (PSS) and a threat actor known as Arid\nViper — removing their ability to use their infrastructure to abuse our platform, distribute\nmalware and hack people’s accounts across the internet. To the best of our knowledge, this\nis the first public reporting of this PSS activity.\n\nFacebook threat intelligence analysts and security experts work to find and stop a wide\n[range of threats including cyber espionage campaigns,](https://about.fb.com/news/2020/12/taking-action-against-hackers-in-bangladesh-and-vietnam/) [influence operations and hacking of](https://about.fb.com/news/tag/coordinated-inauthentic-behavior/)\nour platform by nation-state actors and other groups. As part of these efforts, our teams\nroutinely disrupt adversary operations by disabling them, notifying people if they should take\nsteps to protect their accounts, sharing our findings publicly and continuing to improve the\nsecurity of our products.\n\nToday we’re sharing our latest research into two clusters of unconnected cyber espionage\nactivity. One of them targeted primarily domestic audiences in Palestine. The other cluster\ntargeted audiences in the Palestinian territories and Syria and to a lesser extent Turkey, Iraq,\nLebanon and Libya.\n\n\n-----\n\nTo disrupt both these operations, we took down their accounts, released malware hashes,\nblocked domains associated with their activity and alerted people who we believe were\ntargeted by these groups to help them secure their accounts. We shared information with our\nindustry partners including the anti-virus community so they too can detect and stop this\nactivity, strengthening our collective response against these groups across the internet. We\n[encourage people to remain vigilant and take steps to protect their accounts, avoid clicking](https://www.facebook.com/help/213481848684090?helpref=related&ref=related&source_cms_id=235353253505947)\non suspicious links and downloading software from untrusted sources that can compromise\ntheir devices and information stored on them.\n\nThe groups behind these operations are persistent adversaries, and we know they will\nevolve their tactics in response to our enforcement. However, we keep improving our\ndetection systems and collaborating with other teams in the security community to continue\nmaking it harder for these threat actors to remain undetected. We’ll keep sharing our findings\nwhen possible so people are aware of the threats we’re seeing and can take steps to\nstrengthen the security of their accounts.\n\n## Here’s What We Found\n\n**PSS-Linked Group**\n\nThis activity originated in the West Bank and focused on the Palestinian territories and Syria,\nand to a lesser extent Turkey, Iraq, Lebanon and Libya. It relied on social engineering to trick\npeople into clicking on malicious links and installing malware on their devices. Our\ninvestigation found links to the Preventive Security Service — the Palestinian Authority’s\ninternal intelligence organization.\n\nThis persistent threat actor focused on a wide range of targets, including journalists, people\nopposing the Fatah-led government, human rights activists and military groups including the\nSyrian opposition and Iraqi military. They used their own low-sophistication malware\ndisguised as secure chat applications, in addition to malware tools openly available on the\ninternet.\n\nOur investigation analyzed a number of notable tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs):\n\n\n-----\n\n**Android malware: This group s custom-built Android malware had relatively simple**\nfunctionality and required a limited set of device-level permissions, which likely helped\nit to stay under the radar for most anti-virus detection systems. This malware\nmasqueraded as secure chat applications. Once installed, it collected information such\nas device metadata (e.g. manufacturer, OS version, IMEI), call logs, location, contacts\nand text messages. In rare cases, it also contained keylogger functionality — an ability\nto record every keystroke made on a device. Once collected, the malware would\nupload the data to Firebase, a mobile app development platform. In addition to their\ncustom-made malware, this group also utilized publicly available Android malware\n[called SpyNote which had more functionality including remote device access and the](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-spynote-android-trojan-builder-leaked/)\nability to monitor calls.\n**Windows malware: This group occasionally deployed publicly available malware for**\n[Windows, including NJRat and HWorm, commonly used in the region. They also](https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/njrat-h-worm-variant-infections-continue-rise)\nbundled Windows malware in the installer package for their own decoy application for\njournalists to submit human rights-related articles for publication. This app had no\nlegitimate functionality.\n**Social engineering: This group used fake and compromised accounts to create**\nfictitious personas posing primarily as young women, and also as supporters of Hamas,\nFatah, various military groups, journalists and activists to build trust with people they\ntargeted and trick them into installing malicious software. Some of their Pages were\ndesigned to lure particular followers for later social engineering and malware targeting.\nLikely to build audiences, these Pages posted memes criticizing Russian foreign policy\nin the Middle East, Russian military contractor Wagner Group and its involvement in\nSyria and Libya and the Assad government.\n\n**Threat Indicators:**\n\n**Android C2 Domains**\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nnews fbcb4.firebaseio[.]com\nnews-fbcb4.appspot[.]com\nchaty-98547.firebaseio[.]com\nchaty-98547.appspot[.]com\njamila-c8420.firebaseio[.]com\njamila-c8420.appspot[.]com\nshowra-22501.firebaseio[.]com\nshowra-22501.appspot[.]com\ngoodwork-25869.firebaseio[.]com\ngoodwork-25869.appspot[.]com\nadvance-chat-app.firebaseio[.]com\nadvance-chat-app.appspot[.]com\nfiltersapp-715ee.firebaseio[.]com\nfiltersapp-715ee.appspot[.]com\nhumanrights-1398b.firebaseio[.]com\nhumanrights-1398b.appspot[.]com\njamilabouhaird-c0935.firebaseio[.]com\njamilabouhaird-c0935.appspot[.]com\nhotchat-f0c0e.appspot[.]com\nhotnewchat.appspot[.]com\n\n```\n**Android Hashes**\n```\naeb0c38219e714ab881d0065b9fc1915ba84ad5b86916a82814d056f1dfaf66d\n3c21c0f64ef7b606abb73b9574d0d66895e180e6d1cf2ad21addd5ade79b69fb\nd2787aff6e827809b836e62b06cca68bec92b3e2144f132a0015ce397cf3cac2\n2580f7afb4746b223b14aceab76bd8bc2e4366bfa55ebf203de2715176032525\nf7ea82e4c329bf8e29e9da37fcaf35201dd79c2fc55cc0feb88aedf0b2d26ec2\n0540051935145fb1e3f9361ec55b62a759ce6796c1f355249805d186046328dc\n03de278ec4c4855b885520a377f8b1df462a1d8a4b57b492b3b052aafe509793\nfe77e052dc1a8ebea389bc0d017191e0f41d8e47d034c30df95e3d0dc33cfe10\n6356d55c79a82829c949a46c762f9bb4ca53da01a304b13b362a8a9cab20d4d2\n9a53506c429fa4ff9113b2cbd37d96c708b4ebb8f3424c1b7f6b05ef678f2230\nbf61c078157dd7523cb580672273190de5de3d41577f5d66c5afcdfeade09213\n154cb010e8ac4c50a47f4b218c133b5c7d059f5aff4c2820486e0ae511966e89\n44ccafb69e61139d9107a87f58133c43b8586931faf620c38c1824057d66d614\n\n```\n**SpyNote C2**\n```\nlion20810397.ddns[.]net\n\n```\n**Windows Malware C2 Domains**\n```\ncamera.dvrcam[.]info\nfacebooks.ddns[.]me\ngoogle.loginto[.]me\n\n```\n**Windows Malware Hashes**\n```\n05320c7348c156f0a98907d2b1527ff080eae36437d58735f2822d9f42f5d273\n\n```\n**Links to Android Malware**\n\n\n-----\n\n```\napp chat1.atwebpages[.]com\napp-showchat.atwebpages[.]com\nshowra-chat.atwebpages[.]com\n\n## Arid Viper\n\n```\nThis activity originated in Palestine and targeted individuals in the same region, including\ngovernment officials, members of the Fatah political party, student groups and security\nforces. Our investigation linked this campaign to Arid Viper, a known advanced persistent\nthreat actor. It used sprawling infrastructure to support its operations, including over a\nhundred websites that either hosted iOS and Android malware, attempted to steal credentials\nthrough phishing or acted as command and control servers.\n\nThey appear to operate across multiple internet services, using a combination of social\nengineering, phishing websites and continually evolving Windows and Android malware in\ntargeted cyber espionage campaigns.\n\nWe shared threat indicators with industry peers and security researchers as part of a\nconcerted effort to disrupt this group’s operations. We’re also sharing a detailed technical\nreport with our findings, including threat indicators to help advance our industry’s\nunderstanding of this adversary (below).\n\nHere are our key findings and some of the notable tactics, techniques and procedures\n(TTPs) we’ve observed:\n\n**Custom iOS Surveillanceware:**\n\nArid Viper used custom-built iOS surveillanceware which hasn’t been previously\nreported and reflects a tactical shift. We call this iOS component Phenakite due to it\nbeing rare and deriving its name from the Greek word Phenakos, meaning to deceive\nor cheat.\nInstallation of Phenakite required that people be tricked into installing a mobile\nconfiguration profile. This allowed for a device-specific signed version of the iOS app to\nbe installed on a device. A jailbroken device wasn’t required.\nPost-installation, a jailbreak was necessary for the malware to elevate its privileges to\nretrieve sensitive user information not accessible via standard iOS permission\nrequests. This was achieved with the publicly available Osiris jailbreak that made use\nof the Sock Port exploit, both of which were bundled in the malicious iOS app store\npackages (IPAs).\nArid Viper’s iOS surveillanceware was trojanized inside a fully functional chat\napplication that used the open-source RealtimeChat code for legitimate app\nfunctionality. This malware could also direct people to phishing pages for Facebook\nand iCloud to steal their credentials for those services.\nArid Viper’s use of custom iOS surveillanceware shows that this capability is becoming\nincreasingly attainable by adversaries believed to be of lower sophistication.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Evolving Android and Windows Malware**\n\nThe Android tooling used by Arid Viper shares many similarities with malware\n[previously reported as FrozenCell and](https://blog.lookout.com/frozencell-mobile-threa) [VAMP.](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-targeted-attacks-middle-east-using-kasperagent-micropsia/)\nThe Android malware deployed by Arid Viper required people to install apps from thirdparty sources on their devices. The group used various convincing, attacker-controlled\nsites to create the impression that the apps were legitimate.\nArid Viper’s recent operations also used variants of a malware family known as\nMicropsia, which previously has been associated with this threat actor.\n\n**Malware Distribution**\n\nDelivery of both the Android and iOS malware involved social engineering.\nAndroid malware was typically hosted on convincing looking attacker-controlled\nphishing sites. At the time of this writing, we discovered 41 such sites.\niOS malware was previously found to be distributed from a 3rd party Chinese app\ndevelopment site. After we shared our findings with industry partners which led to the\nrevocation of multiple developer certificates, Arid Viper’s ability to distribute Phenakite\nwas disrupted. We’ve since seen them try setting up their own infrastructure to\ndistribute their iOS implant.\nWhile Arid Viper tooling has previously been discovered in official app channels like the\nPlay Store, we didn’t find it to be the case in this most recent campaign.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Compromise Flow:**\n\n\n-----\n\n[See the full Threat Report on Arid Viper for more information and IOCs.](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Technical-threat-report-Arid-Viper-April-2021.pdf)\n\nDownloads\n[Technical Threat Report: Arid Viper](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Technical-threat-report-Arid-Viper-April-2021.pdf)\n\n\n-----",
