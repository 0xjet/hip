The press later confirmed that the attack included ransomware. The](https://securityscorecard.com/blog/ten-examples-of-recent-and-impactful-ransomware-attacks)\nFBI stated on May 10, 2021, that the DarkSide ransomware group -- also known as Carbon\nSpider -- was responsible for the attack.\n\nSecurityScorecard conducted an analysis of the attack analyzing NetFlow data (data\nassociated with data transfers on the Internet) and determined that a large amount of data\nwas exfiltrated from Colonial Pipeline networks to IP addresses also associated with other\nransomware attacks for which Carbon Spider has previously taken responsibility. Through\nthis analysis, combined with identifying and deconstructing associated malware and\ncorrelation with other known victims, SecurityScorecard can confirm with moderate\nconfidence that DarkSide also known as Carbon Spider was responsible for the Colonial\nPipeline attack and potentially other ransomware attacks.\n\n## Key findings\n\n\n-----\n\nThrough an ongoing investigation, SecurityScorecard has found with a moderate\nconfidence level that the DarkSide ransomware group, also known as Carbon Spider,\ntransferred data from Colonial Pipeline on May 6, 2021, to an external IP address, one\nday prior to public reports.\nThrough SecurityScorecard’s analysis, we have identified other organizations that\nCarbon Spider has already claimed to have attacked as well as others that have not\nbeen previously identified.\nSecurityScorecard’s research indicates that Carbon Spider exfiltrated data from the\nColonial Pipeline network likely for use in an extortion attempt, just as we see with\nmany other ransomware groups.\nSecurityScorecard did not find any evidence of direct disruption of the critical\ninfrastructure owned and operated by Colonial Pipeline. However, it is plausible that\nCarbon Spider caused damage to other parts of the Colonial Pipeline network.\nDarkSide ransomware is designed to encrypt files that are often irreversible without a\ndecrypter from the authors.\nSecurityScorecard observed that this group has been operating since August 2020\nthrough dark web leak postings.\nThe attribution analysis was made based on publicly available data in both clearweb\nand open access to dark web sources.\n\n## Background\n\nThe DarkSide ransomware group, also known as Carbon Spider, is suspected to have\nbreached Colonial Pipeline (Colonial). Carbon Spider is a Russian criminal group focused on\ndeveloping and using DarkSide ransomware. This group follows a traditional Advanced\nPersistent Threat (APT) like pattern of intrusion (i.e. gain access to a network through a\nknown vulnerability, perform reconnaissance within the network and identify targeted data for\nencryption/exfiltration) that we have seen in other targeted attacks. The following is an\nintelligence assessment from SecurityScorecard’s Investigations & Analysis team.\n\n## Investigation\n\nReviewing the techniques, tactics, and procedures used by this attacker, the threat actor\nutilized Cobalt Strike amongst many other tools. Cobalt Strike is a tool frequently used by\nRussian APTs and criminal groups involved in the distribution of ransomware. The Cobalt\nFramework is considered a file-less implant (residing in memory) of the infected victim and\nallows for the attacker to introduce additional malware.\n\nSecurityScorecard’s Investigations & Analysis team focused on understanding the actor's\ncapability and intent. SecurityScorecard found that over 80GB of data was transferred from\nthe Colonial Pipeline network to an external IP address. Based on our observations the actor\nexfiltrated data from the victim’s network likely in an extortion attempt, like many other\nransomware groups.\n\n\n-----\n\nSecurityScorecard did not observe any evidence of direct disruption of the critical\ninfrastructure owned and operated by Colonial that resulted in the shutdown of the pipeline.\nHowever, it is plausible that DarkSide caused damage to systems in parts of their network,\nas DarkSide is designed to encrypt files on disk which are often unrecoverable without a\ndecrypter from the authors.\n\nAdditionally, using NetFlow analysis, the Investigations & Analysis team observed details\naround data exfiltration to understand connections made between the victim’s network and\nthe adversary’s infrastructure. NetFlow data is similar to call detail records which record time,\nduration, routing details between phones, but not the content of the conversation. NetFlow\ndata shows which IP addresses were connected, the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)\nport that was used, and the number of packets and bytes that were transmitted. This is a key\nelement of SecurityScorecard’s investigation as it provides critical insight into victimology and\nenables us to link it back to Carbon Spider. NetFlow, like call detail records, does not include\ncontent of the transmission so we were unable to view the data exfiltrated. However, we can\nassume the data will be used to extort the victim. It is possible that sensitive data stolen from\nColonial could make its way to Carbon Spider’s leak site if the company does not pay.\n\n## Malicious infrastructure\n\nUsing SecurityScorecard’s in-house analysis methods, we were able to extract several\nconfiguration files relating to Cobalt Strike that provided additional insight into the\nadversaries’ infrastructure. In any incident response investigation, understanding the\ninfrastructure used by the threat actor will enable the discovery of additional indicators of\ncompromise (IOC). Upon infecting victims a ransomware note is left on the victim’s PC with\ninstructions for payment.\n\n\n-----\n\n_DarkSide Ransom Note_\n\nFrom a malicious infrastructure perspective, there are several elements involved in this\nattack.\n\nData exfiltration IPs\nCobalt Strike beacons\n\n### Cobalt strike beacons\n\nOf the domains and IPs reported by the FBI, the following are verified to be active at the time\nof this writing:\n\nOpenmsdn[.]xyz\n45.153.184[.]167\nSecurity-desk[.]com\n213.252.247[.]18\n\nBeacon DLLs can be injected into the following legitimate Windows processes:\n\nRundll32.exe\nsvchost.exe\n\nHashes for these DLLs are:\n\n\n-----\n\nc1b288c1426bac664c6df61c10367ff71704213a\n05233911465a0131ce15115df4807d8cd3024fd9\n4bba9fc4a3b09cb8d3c206c9d8f5d5a6e9ec226c\n535bb593b64b1c91327df657d776a573a8afc3f7\nEe82c429fb3db89a61a222abe6458b604c3644a6\nbfb9a58aaba4198fc189e44bdcf397453efebdec\n\nPossible User-agents these DLLs will use are:\n\nMozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 8.0.0; SM-G960F Build/R16NW) AppleWebKit/537.36\n(KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/62.0.3202\nMozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 10.0; Windows NT 6.2; WOW64; Trident/6.0; MDDCJS)\n\nThese DLLs were found to have a heartbeat of:\n\n60 +/- 0 seconds\n59.290 +/- 22 seconds\n\n_Cobalt Strike beacon configuration_\n\n### Malicious C2 server\n\nThe FBI reported on May 10, 2021, that IP address 159.65.225.72 is affiliated with the\nDarkSide ransomware group as a data exfiltration destination. The address is hosted in\nDigitalOcean, an American cloud provider, in AS14061 within their NYC region. As of the last\n\n\n-----\n\nSecurityScorecard scan on May 5, 2021, the only service running on the C2 IP was SSH\n(port 22). Our NetFlow analysis demonstrates that SSH was used as the data exfiltration\nmethod.\n\n## Data exfiltration\n\nSecurityScorecard can confirm reports in both media and by the FBI that the adversary was\npresent in the Colonial Pipeline environment. We were able to identify a connection between\nthe Colonial Pipeline network and a malicious asset associated with Carbon Spider.\n\nThe Investigations & Analysis team identified a connection between the victim’s IP\n(198.154.26.212) and IP address 159.65.225.72, as mentioned above to be associated with\nthe DarkSide ransomware group by the FBI. Our investigation confirmed the connection by\ncross-referencing the IPs with NetFlow data from our datasets. Based on our analysis at\nleast 80GB+ of data was exfiltrated from Colonial and sent to the adversary between GMT:\nThursday, 6 May 2021 10:31:22 and GMT: Thursday, 6 May 2021 12:22:20.\n\n## Victimology\n\nBeyond Colonial Pipeline, there are additional suspected victims of DarkSide ransomware\nthat SecurityScorecard has identified based on NetFlow analysis.\n\n### Potential other victims\n\n**Victim** **Date** **Data Transfer**\n\nLarge Retailer 5/6/2021 2117GB\n\nDedicated Cloud Solutions Provider 5/5/2021 1129GB\n\n[Smilebrands](https://hacknotice.com/2021/04/23/smile-brands/) 4/24/2021 451GB\n\n[Colonial Pipeline](https://app.hacknotice.com/#/hack/6096d111053921134876e084) 5/6/2021 87GB\n\nLarge Distribution Company 4/27/2021 50GB\n\nCloud Platform Provider 4/27/2021 117GB\n\n[Homehardware](https://app.hacknotice.com/#/hack/6067725a0b684c5d8e53bbbf) 2/18/2021 84GB\n\nThe attacker utilized the server in DigitalOcean to exfiltrate data from a number of entities,\nincluding Colonial Pipeline. Some of these addresses correlate with victims found on the\n\n\n-----\n\nthreat actor s own leak site, but others have not previously been identified as victims.\n\n_SmileBrands leaked on TOR site_\n\n_Homehardware_\n\nTo find potential victims, SecurityScorecard collected the unique IP addresses that\ncommunicated with the data exfiltration IP address on port 22 and had more than 1000\npackets in the past three months. Some IP addresses communicated with the data\nexfiltration server for an unusually long period of time compared to Colonial, where the data\nwas exfiltrated in 2 hours. We suspect those IP addresses may have been used by the\nattackers reviewing and downloading the data exfiltrated from victims’ networks. We have\nalso observed many IP addresses that have very few flows, which might suggest attackers\ncould have used proxies to connect to the data exfiltration servers.\n\n\n-----\n\nDarkSide has stored their leaked data here\n\n542lsflqr4hgurjx.onion\nRu4rklde4l4sghhf.onion\nErc4xzvrchka5izw.onion\nIxltdyumdlthrtgx.onion\nFylszpcqfel7joif.onion\nGtmx56k4hutn3ikv.onion\nhxt254aygrsziejn.onion\n[DarkSide Ransomware press site](http://darksidc3iux462n6yunevoag52ntvwp6wulaz3zirkmh4cnz6hhj7id.onion/press-center/more)\n\n### Attribution\n\nAttribution is often difficult and requires much analysis to attribute any cyber-attack to a\nspecific group with any degree of certainty. SecurityScorecard concludes, because of the\nAnalysis of Competing Hypotheses below, that the most likely scenario is that Carbon Spider\nconducted the attack. Our analysis supports the hypothesis, based on the correlation of\nNetFlow data with reported victims in the Carbon Spider’s leak site, that the Colonial Pipeline\nattack was conducted by this adversary.\n\nSecurityScorecard can also confirm the Colonial Pipeline attack involves DarkSide\nransomware and not another family of malware.\n\n## Analysis of completing hypothesis (in progress)\n\nIn intelligence analysis, we use a model known as the analysis of competing hypotheses.\nThis is a model designed to rank evidence against multiple hypotheses; in this case, we had\nseveral likely scenarios connected with this incident.\n\n\n**Evidence** **Hypothesis**\n**1**\n\n\n**Hypothesis**\n**3**\n\nWas the\nAPT actor\nresponsible\nfor the\nbreach?\n\n\n**Hypothesis 4** **Hypothesis**\n**5**\n\n\nIs this a false\nflag operation,\nmasquerading\nas a\nRansomware\ngroup (cover\nfor APT\noperation)\n\n\nEvidence\npoints\n\n\nWas\nDarkSide\nRansomware\ngang\nresponsible\nfor the\nColonial\nbreach?\n\n\n**Hypothesis**\n**2**\n\nWas another\nRansomware\nactor\nresponsible\nfor the\nbreach?\n\n\nA DarkSide\nRAAS\naffiliate is\nresponsible\nfor this\nbreach.\n\n\n-----\n\nDarkSide\nRansomware\nnews leak\nsite indicates\nthey do not\nwish to\ncause\nproblems in\nsociety\n\nOSINT\nreporting is\nindicating\nDarkSide\nRansomware\ngroup is\nresponsible.\n\nFBI Confirms\nDarkSide\nwas behind\nthe Colonial\naccording to\nChris Bing.\n\n\nWas\nDarkSide\nRansomware\ngang\nresponsible\nfor the\nColonial\nbreach?\n\nWas\nDarkSide\nRansomware\ngang\nresponsible\nfor the\nColonial\nbreach?\n\n\nIs this a false\nflag operation,\nmasquerading\nas a\nRansomware\ngroup?\n\n\nA DarkSide\nRAAS\naffiliate is\nresponsible\nfor this\nbreach.\n\n\nDownload the blog post as a PDF.\n\n[Download](https://s3.amazonaws.com/ssc-corporate-website-production/documents/darkside-likely-responsible-for-colonial-pipeline-ransomware-attach.pdf)\n\n\n-----",
