However, if there was any noticeable stoppage, it certainly didn’t last very long.\nShortly after hearing about this I started checking my logs for any exploit kit activity and, as\nusual, I found a detection for RIG EK from one of our Palo Alto firewalls. Checking the traffic\nbefore the RIG EK detection showed the culprit to be the Seamless campaign.\n\nHere is an example of the infection chain that I found:\n```\nAd -> 193.124.xxx.xxx/vnc-seller -> 193.124.xxx.xxx/vnc-seller/ -> parematedconproxy[.]com -> 15cen.redirectvoluum[.]com -> 194.58.xxx.xxx/signu1.php\n\n```\nThe redirection chain that I found hasn’t changed much, however, this is the first time I’ve\nseen requests for /vnc-seller and /vnc-seller/. This could have had something to do with the\ngeo-location of the host or the HTTP referer.\n\nOther notable changes include the addition of the domain paremated-conproxy[.]com and the\nsubdomain 15cen.redirectvoluum[.]com. They had been using the subdomains\ntqbeu.voluumtrk[.]com and tqbeu.redirectvoluum[.]com to redirect hosts to the Seamless\ngate.\n\nThe domain paremated-conproxy[.]com was first seen on 8/18/17. The Whois information is\n[private. The subdomain 15cen.redirectvoluum[.]com was registered by CodeWise and was](https://codewise.com/)\n[first seen on 08/21/17. They’re using CodeWise’s marketing suite called “Voluum“.](https://voluum.com/)\n\nFurthermore, the Seamless .php file that returns the iframe pointing to the RIG EK landing\npage is now called signu[1-4].php rather than signup[1-4].php.\n\nIt was at this point that I decided to go hunting for my own infection.\n\nThe publisher that I used for my infection chain was another video streaming site. According\nto Alexa it is currently ranked in the top 69,000 globally and top 36,000 in the United States.\nBelow is Alexa’s statistics on the site’s visitors by country:\n\n**Country** **Percent of Visitors** **Rank in Country**\n\nUnited States 27.20% 35,100\n\nUnited Kingdom 14.60% 13,900\n\nIndia 12.50% 23,900\n\n\n-----\n\nSouth Africa 4.60% 7,500\n\nAustralia 3.80% 19,100\n\nOverall the site received roughly 340,000 visitors in the last 30 days.\n\nBelow is a flowchart from my infection:\n\n\n-----\n\nBelow is an image of the HTTP, DNS, and C2 traffic filtered in Wireshark:\n\nThe Ramnit payload was dropped and detonated in %Temp%. We then see the malware\ncopy itself to a new folder in %LocalAppData% where it was then executed.\n\nOnce the file is run from %LocalAppData% we see the first DNS query for Google.com. After\nsuccessfully resolving Google.com comes the DNS query for the C2 domain\nh62yeey62tqgshy.com (resolves to 46.173.213.134). The infected host then initiated\nconnections to the C2 server via TCP port 443.\n\nDuring this same time, you see two more copies of the malware being dropped back into\n%Temp% as well as Ramnit’s .log files being created in various locations like\n%LocalAppData% and %ProgramData%:\n\n\n-----\n\nThis same beaconing pattern with Google.com and the C2 repeats itself over and over again:\n\n\n-----\n\nShows socket information and includes the name and ID of the process responsible for the connection\n\nWe can also see that the malware creates various methods of persistence on the system,\nincluding creating a file in Startup and setting some values in the registry:\n\nSETVAL; Path: HKCUSOFTWAREMICROSOFTWINDOWSCURRENTVERSIONRUN\n\nSETVAL; Path: HKLMSOFTWAREMICROSOFTWINDOWS\nNTCURRENTVERSIONWINLOGON\n\n\n-----\n\nMalware is set to run at startup\n\n**IOCs**\n\nPre-infection:\n\n194.58.40.48 – IP literal hostname used by the Seamless campaign\n\n188.225.74.81 – IP literal hostname used by RIG EK\n\nPost-infection:\n\nDNS queries for h62yeey62tqgshy.com\n\nConnections to 46.173.213.134 via TCP port 443\n\nHashes\n\n[SHA256: ff1184382121f67d04aafb09879bddbd449b1e95b2ca50933fce1574ffb84b50](https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/ff1184382121f67d04aafb09879bddbd449b1e95b2ca50933fce1574ffb84b50/analysis/1503518222/)\n\nFile name: RigEK landing page from 188.225.74.81.txt\n\n[SHA256: cbf7dfc2226e592149ef45539c9a4f109c4e66533fe061037241fb88c245ce57](https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/cbf7dfc2226e592149ef45539c9a4f109c4e66533fe061037241fb88c245ce57/analysis/1503518228/)\n\nFile name: RigEK Flash exploit from 188.225.74.81.swf\n\n[SHA256: 62687447bd28623e2a584e4c0e761b5ed365bfe057621523a29025d4210fcada](https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/62687447bd28623e2a584e4c0e761b5ed365bfe057621523a29025d4210fcada/analysis/)\n\nFile name: o32.tmp\n\n[SHA256: 8995e321efc5cedbc979e43d9f7c84440b346573dbeb71b7a3c941052ad87428](https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/8995e321efc5cedbc979e43d9f7c84440b346573dbeb71b7a3c941052ad87428/analysis/)\n\nFile name: 949ideuf.exe\n\n[Hybrid-Analysis Report](https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/sample/8995e321efc5cedbc979e43d9f7c84440b346573dbeb71b7a3c941052ad87428?environmentId=100)\n\n**Downloads**\n\n[Seamless RigEK Ramnit Malicious Artifacts 082217.zip](https://malwarebreakdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/seamless-rigek-ramnit-malicious-artifacts-082217.zip)\n\nPassword is “infected”\n\nUntil next time!\n\n## Published by malwarebreakdown\n\nJust a normal person who spends their free time infecting systems with malware.
