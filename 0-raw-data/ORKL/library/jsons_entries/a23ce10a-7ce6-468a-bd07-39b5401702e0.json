[BlackBerry Blog](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en.html)\n2. Mustang Panda Uses the Russian-Ukrainian War to Attack Europe and Asia Pacific Targets\n\n_[Mustang Panda continue targeting countries across Europe and Asia Pacific, utilizing current geopolitical](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2022/10/mustang-panda-abuses-legitimate-apps-to-target-myanmar-based-victims)_\n_events to their advantage. Their attack chain remains consistent, with the continued use of archive files,_\n_shortcut files, malicious loaders, and the use of PlugX malware. Based on the lure covered in this blog, the_\n_goal of this particular operation appears to be collecting sensitive information from European countries and_\n_states from Asia, which might be supporting Western countries._\n\n### Summary\n\nAs part of ongoing hunting and continuous monitoring efforts regarding the advanced persistent threat (APT)\ngroup [Mustang Panda, the BlackBerry Threat Research and Intelligence team recently came across an](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/actor/mustang_panda)\ninteresting RAR file titled “Political Guidance for the new EU approach towards Russia.rar”.\n\nThis file captured our interest due to the ongoing geopolitical situation in Eastern Europe. An examination of\nits contents revealed a decoy document matching the naming convention of the RAR, along with additional\n[components that are often seen as part of a typical PlugX infection chain.](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2022/10/mustang-panda-abuses-legitimate-apps-to-target-myanmar-based-victims)\n\n\n-----\n\nBy delving into the associated network infrastructure and pivoting off related network artifacts, additional files\nand infrastructure were uncovered. These conformed to similar Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)\nand appeared to be part of a larger campaign from this same threat actor targeting multiple entities, both\nGovernment and Private, in several industries and throughout many countries across the world. In this report,\nwe document what we found.\n\n_[You can read our previous post on Mustang Panda here.](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2022/10/mustang-panda-abuses-legitimate-apps-to-target-myanmar-based-victims)_\n\n### Weaponization and Technical Overview\n\n**Weapons** DLL Loaders + encrypted .dat payloads\n\n**Attack Vector** Current event-themed phishing lures\n\n\n**Network**\n**Infrastructure**\n\n\nWeb based command-and-control (C2)\n\n\n**Targets** Mining, Education, Telecoms, Financial, CDN Companies, Internet Service Providers,\nInternet Security Firms, Web Hosting Companies\n\n### Technical Analysis\n\n**Context**\n\nMustang Panda, also known as HoneyMyte, Bronze President or Red Delta, is one of the more active APT\ngroups in operation on the threat landscape today, with a wide variety of campaigns documented as far back\nas [2012. It is](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/mustang-panda-targets-europe/) [publicly attributed to China-based cyberespionage threat actors.](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0129/)\n\nIt is continually honing its capabilities, but its core approach remains consistent, with the use of themed lures\nrelated to current events. These contain decoy documents and legitimate applications that are susceptible to\nDLL search order hijacking.\n\nThis is exploited to coerce targets into executing a malicious loader to deliver a PlugX payload. The RAR\narchive – “Political Guidance for the new EU approach towards Russia.rar\" – aligned with numerous TTPs\n[related to Mustang Panda that have previously been documented by both BlackBerry and](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2022/10/mustang-panda-abuses-legitimate-apps-to-target-myanmar-based-victims) [other vendors.](https://www.secureworks.com/blog/bronze-president-targets-government-officials)\n\n### Mustang Panda Attack Vector\n\nA RAR file is an archive that contains one or more files compressed with RAR compression. As seen in\nrecent campaigns, the use of archives is a common infection vector for Mustang Panda. The political theme\nof the RAR file is a tactic employed by the threat actor to coerce targets into opening the file. Once the\narchive is open, the victim will see a directory called “_” and a shortcut file named with the same politically\nthemed lure.\n\nThe .LNK file uses a double file extension in an attempt to disguise the shortcut file as a document in the\nhope the target would open it, in the process executing the shortcut file. This utilization of double extensions\n[has been used by Mustang Panda in the past as a way to convince users to execute the shortcut file.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/meet-crowdstrikes-adversary-of-the-month-for-june-mustang-panda/)\n\nThe shortcut file contains a command that kicks off the initial execution of the attack chain:\n\n\n-----\n\n_C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe /c _\\___\\_\\___\\______\\_____\\__\\test11.bpu||(forfiles / P_\n_%USERPROFILE%\\ /S /^M \"Political Guidance for the new EU approach towards Russia.rar\" /C \"cmd /c_\n_(c:\\progra~1\\7-Zip\\7z x -y -aoa @path||c:\\progra~2\\7-Zip\\7z x -y -aoa @path”_\n\n_Figure 1: Phishing lure contents_\n\nThe LNK file looks to execute “test11.bpu”, which is a legitimate portable executable (PE) file called\n[“ClassicExplorerSettings.exe” belonging to Classic Shell, which is a freeware utility used to customize the](http://www.classicshell.net/)\nlook of the Windows system.®\n\n_Figure 2: MZ file header_\n\n**Hashes (md5, sha-256)** 7177ab83a40a4111eb0170a76e92142b\n\nf70d3601fb456a18ed7e7ed599d10783447016da78234f5dca61b8bd3a084a15\n\n**File Name** Political Guidance for the new EU approach towards Russia.rar\n\n**File Size** 567144 bytes\n\n**Created** 2022-11-01 02:32\n\n**Last Modified** 1979-11-29 13:00\n\n### Weaponization\n\n\n-----\n\n[The Mustang Panda attack chain is reliant on the DLL sideloading technique previously used in their](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/002/)\n[campaign targeting Myanmar, where the threat actor plants both a legitimate executable and a payload](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2022/10/mustang-panda-abuses-legitimate-apps-to-target-myanmar-based-victims)\n[alongside each other, a technique which is designed to take advantage of the search order of a program as](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/001/)\nsoon as the legitimate application has been invoked. Once the shortcut file is executed, the legitimate\napplication will be launched and the malicious DLL loader will also get invoked.\n\n“ClassicExplorer32.dll” is planted in the same directory as “test11.bpu” to abuse the search order once the\nexecutable is invoked. The purpose of the DLL is to load the “ClassicExplorerLog.dat” file and execute the\nshellcode within it. Interestingly, the loader used seems to have a subtle change in how the shellcode is\ndecrypted and executed.\n\n[Mustang Panda DLL loaders reported by Secureworks back in September were utilizing the](https://www.secureworks.com/blog/bronze-president-targets-government-officials)\n_EnumThreadWindows API to pass execution to the start of the malicious payload file. In these more recent_\nsamples, the DLL loader uses the EnumSystemCodePagesW API to execute the shellcode similarly. A\npointer to the already decrypted shellcode is passed to EnumSystemCodePagesW API as an applicationdefined callback function, as seen in Figure 3 below. The use of the EnumSystemCodePagesW API was\n[mentioned in a Twitter thread by kienbigmummy and also seen in a Black Hat Asia presentation. The purpose](https://twitter.com/kienbigmummy/status/1582217455568531456?s=20&t=3CR_HKwMeq3ctU2Qicm7AQ)\nof the shellcode is to decrypt and execute the final malicious payload – PlugX – in memory.\n\n_Figure 3: DLL Loader utilizing EnumSystemCodePagesW to load and execute shellcode_\n\n**Hashes (md5, sha-256)** ae105528a6c5758ccf18705a8c208a97\n\nb44cc792ae7f58e9a12a121c14a067ee1dd380df093339b4bf2b02df5937b2af\n\n**ITW File Name** ClassicExplorerSettings.exe\n\n**Compilation Stamp** 2017-08-13 15:49:42 UTC\n\n**File Type/Signature** PE32 executable for MS Windows (GUI) Intel 80386 32-bit\n\n\n-----\n\n**File Size** 98616 bytes\n\n**Hashes (md5, sha-256)** 6d6a0ca7c7343eedfffeb697229a4929\n\n8e27900949a087349488d82e7434937bd253d31749041bb0233000a7339fc3e1\n\n**ITW File Name** ClassicExplorer32.dll\n\n**Compilation Stamp** 2022-10-25 09:32:51 UTC\n\n**File Type/Signature** PE32 executable for MS Windows (DLL) (GUI) Intel 80386 32-bit\n\n**File Size** 115000 bytes\n\n**Hashes (md5, sha-256)** a95f48acd5da4beddd4115e12653c23c\n\n9c1ea202237726984b754d17528cfab0212ff9587bbffaf01c8535277b01c24a\n\n**ITW File Name** ClassicExplorerLog.bin, ClassicExplorerLog.dat\n\n**File Type/Signature** DATA File\n\n**File Size** 614718 bytes\n\nOnce the PlugX payload has been decrypted and execution is passed to the payload, we can see the config\nalso get decrypted into memory.

The SSL certificate was first seen being associated with this IP from the period 2022-10-07 to\n2022-10-30.\n\n**Domain Name** **Samples’ Hashes** **First/Last**\n**Seen/ASN**\n\n\n-----\n\n5[.]34[.]178[.]156 a95f48acd5da4beddd4115e12653c23c\n\n9c1ea202237726984b754d17528cfab0212ff9587bbffaf01c8535277b01c24a\n\nCN=45.134.83.29,OU=TLS Demo Cert,O=File Transfer Service, 2.5.4.46=\n#13186d67332f6d4c506d4b335966582f4d614a43732f6d673d3d\n\nIssuer - CN=CTA Root CA, O=TEST TEST TEST,\n2.5.4.46=#13185843794c4248705065757479714b4344383866614e773d3d\n\n### Additional Linked Infrastructure\n\n\n2022-07-19\n\n2022-10-31\n\nASN:204957\n\n\nPivoting on the certificate showed 15 other IP addresses utilizing the same SSL certificate. Five of these were\nbeing used as C2 servers for the same attack chain delivering lures/decoys in the form of RAR files, in the\nhopes of the victims executing PlugX malware in memory.\n\nThe lures all varied but all aligned with the previous campaigns associated with Mustang Panda.\n\n_Figure 7: SSL certificate showing C2 pivoting_\n\n\n-----\n\n### Targets\n\nMustang Panda’s previous targets have included Government and Non-Government Organizations (NGO) in\nmany locations around the world, from various states in Southeast Asia, to the European Union, to the U.S.\nand beyond. Considering the decoy lures found, as well as the correlating network telemetry, we found the\nthreat actor to be targeting areas in Europe as well as Asia-Pacific, specifically Vietnam. This is not an\nexhaustive list as we have been unable to identify the industries of all the victims thus far.\n\n_Figure 8: Partial list of victims_\n\n### Conclusions\n\nMustang Panda continues to utilize well-thought-out lures related to current events to deliver the PlugX\nmalware that the group is synonymous with. While Mustang Panda has stayed within their typical TTPs with\nPlugX, including custom lures, double extensions, and infrastructure re-use, they do make subtle changes\nalong the way in the hope of evading detection. The historical data associated with the pivoted SSL certificate\nshows it being first seen on 2022-02-27. It is still being actively used at the time of writing.\n\nMustang Panda has a history of targeting many different entities across the globe, but their target aligns with\nthe interests of the Chinese government. From the associated lures, NetFlow data, and other characteristics,\nthe EU and APAC have been their biggest targets as of late.\n\n### Referential Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)\n\n**Main File**\n\n**File Name** Political Guidance for the new EU approach towards Russia.rar\n\n**SHA256** F70d3601fb456a18ed7e7ed599d10783447016da78234f5dca61b8bd3a084a15\n\n\n-----\n\n**File Type** RAR\n\n**Network Indicator (C2)** 5[.]34.178.156\n\n**Network Indicators**\n\n**C2**\n\n104[.]42.43.178\n\n64[.]34.216.50\n\n45[.]147.26.45\n\n45[.]32.101.7\n\n64[.]34.216.44\n\n185[.]80.201.4\n\n103[.]192.226.87\n\n194[.]124.227.90\n\n43[.]254.218.128\n\n62[.]233.57.49\n\n**Detailed MITRE ATT&CK® Mapping**\n\n**Tactic** **Technique** **Sub-Technique name**\n\nExecution T1203 Exploitation for Client Execution\n\nExecution T1106 Native API\n\nExecution T1129 Shared Module\n\nExecution T1559.001 Component Object Model\n\nExecution T1204.002 Malicious File\n\n\n-----\n\nExecution T1059.003 Windows Command Shell\n\nPersistence/Privilege Escalation T1547.001 Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder\n\nDefense Evasion T1574.002 DLL Side-Loading\n\nDefense Evasion T1027 Obfuscated Files or Information\n\nDefense Evasion T1036 Masquerading\n\nDefense Evasion T1036.007 Double File Extension\n\nDefense Evasion T1218 System Binary Proxy Execution\n\nDefense Evasion T1564.001 Hidden Files and Directories\n\nDefense Evasion T1140 Deobfuscate Decode Files or Information\n\nDiscovery T1057 Process Discovery\n\nDiscovery T1082 System Information Discovery\n\nDiscovery T1518 Software Discovery\n\nDiscovery T1033 System Owner/User Discovery\n\nCollection T1560.001 Archive via Utility\n\nPersistence T1547.009 Shortcut\n\nCommand and Control T1071.001 Web Protocols\n\n**Related Reading:**\n\n\n-----\n\n## About The BlackBerry Research & Intelligence Team\n\nThe BlackBerry Research & Intelligence team examines emerging and persistent threats, providing\nintelligence analysis for the benefit of defenders and the organizations they serve.\n\nBack\n\n\n-----",
