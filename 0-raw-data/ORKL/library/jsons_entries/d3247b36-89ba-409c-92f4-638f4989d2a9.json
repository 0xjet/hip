Unfortunately, just because they don’t often make the news doesn’t mean\nthey’re rare. Compromising libraries or apps before they reach consumers leaves few traces\nand can take a long time before it’s discovered.\n\nIn this case, NPM issued an advisory warning people that a couple of libraries, ‘coa’ and ‘rc’\nhave been compromised and infected with malware.\n\n“The npm package coa had versions published with malicious code. Users of affected\nversions (2.0.3 and above) should downgrade to 2.0.2 as soon as possible and check their\nsystems for suspicious activity,” [stated NPM on GitHub. A similar advisory is available for the](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-73qr-pfmq-6rp8)\n‘rc’ package.\n\n“Any computer that has this package installed or running should be considered fully\ncompromised. All secrets and keys stored on that computer should be rotated immediately\nfrom a different computer. The package should be removed, but as full control of the\ncomputer may have been given to an outside entity, there is no guarantee that removing the\npackage will remove all malicious software resulting from installing it,” NPM added.\n\n\n-----\n\n[The malware attackers deployed seem to be a DanaBot variant, allowing criminals to capture](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/26451f7f6fe297adf6738295b1dcc70f7678434ef21d8b6aad5ec00beb8a72cf/detection)\nand download information from victims’ devices.\n\nUnlike typosquatting attacks, in which criminals create infected libraries with names very\nsimilar to the official ones, the attackers managed to compromise the official repositories and\n[replace the files. That’s why the NPM team issued a statement on Twitter explaining what](https://twitter.com/npmjs/status/1456310581846163457)\nlikely happened.\n\n“This morning we detected multiple versions of the “coa” package published with malicious\ncode due to a compromised account of a maintainer,” said the team. “We quickly removed\nthe compromised versions […] and the compromised account has been temporarily\ndisabled.”\n\nThey also advised other maintainers to enable multi-factor authentication as soon as\npossible, indicating the likely path taken by attackers to compromise the repositories.\n\n**TAGS**\n\n[industry news](http://10.10.0.46/blog/hotforsecurity/tag/industry-news/)\n\n**AUTHOR**\n\n## Silviu STAHIE\n\nSilviu is a seasoned writer who followed the technology world for almost two decades,\ncovering topics ranging from software to hardware and everything in between.\n\n[View all posts](http://10.10.0.46/blog/hotforsecurity/author/sstahie/)\n\n\n-----\n\n-----",
