While we lack visibility into the initial delivery mechanism of\nthis attack, we did observe a secondary payload hosted on 185.177.59[.]70, the IP address\nto which this domain resolved at the time of the activity.\n\nUnit 42 has observed Chafer activity since 2016, however, Chafer has been active since at\nleast [2015. This new secondary payload is Python-based and compiled into executable form](https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/iran-based-attackers-use-back-door-threats-spy-middle-eastern-targets)\nusing the PyInstaller utility. This is the first instance where Unit 42 has identified a Python\n\n-----\n\nbased payload used by these operators. We ve also identified code overlap with OilRig s\nClayside VBScript but at this time track Chafer and OilRig as separate threat groups. We\nhave named this payload MechaFlounder for tracking purposes and discuss details below.\n\n## Turkish Government Targeting\n\nOur visibility into this Chafer activity involves the identification of a malicious executable\ndownloaded from the IP address 185.177.59[.]70. How the attackers are targeting victims\nand causing them to download this file are currently not known.\n\nThe file named ‘lsass.exe’ was downloaded from win10-update[.]com via an HTTP request.\n[The win10-update[.]com domain has been noted in open source as an indicator associated](https://twitter.com/clearskysec/status/976170940722708480)\nwith Chafer threat operations. The lsass.exe file downloaded from this domain is a previously\nunreported python-based payload that we are currently tracking as MechaFlounder. We\nbelieve Chafer uses MechaFlounder as a secondary payload that the group downloads from\na first-stage payload to carry out its post-exploitation activities on the compromised host.\nBased on our telemetry, the first-stage payload was not observed in this activity.\n\nIn February 2018, IP address 134.119.217[.]87 resolved to win10-update[.]com and several\nother domains likely associated with Chafer activity. Of interest, the domain\nturkiyeburslari[.]tk, which mirrors the legitimate Turkish Scholarship government domain\nturkiyeburslari[.]gov[.]tr, also resolved to this IP and may likely have been used in other\nChafer collection operations. The domains associated with this IP address are included\nwithin the Appendix and displayed in Figure 1 below.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. Infrastructure associated with 134.119.217[.]87\n\n## The MechaFlounder Payload\n\nThe python-based payload, ‘lsass.exe’ was retrieved from a command and control (C2)\nserver via an HTTP request to the following URL:\n\nwin10-update[.]com/update.php?req=<redacted>&m=d\n\nThis payload, (SHA256:\n0282b7705f13f9d9811b722f8d7ef8fef907bee2ef00bf8ec89df5e7d96d81ff), which we are\ntracking as MechaFlounder, was developed in Python and bundled as a portable executable\nusing the PyInstaller tool. This secondary payload acts as a backdoor allowing the operator\nto upload and download files, as well as run additional commands and applications on the\ncompromised system.\n\n\n-----\n\nMechaFlounder begins by entering a loop that will continuously attempt to communicate with\nits C2 server. The Trojan will use HTTP to send an outbound beacon to its C2 server that\ncontains the user's account name and hostname in the URL. The code, seen in Figure 2,\nbuilds the URL by concatenating the username and hostname with two dashes \"--\" between\nthe two strings. The code then creates the URL string by using the username and hostname\nstring twice with the back-slash \"\\\" character between the two and by appending the string \"sample.html\".\n\nFigure 2. Trojan code used to build anomalous HTTP request\n\nDuring this analysis, the code in Figure 2 generated anomalous HTTP requests for its\nbeacons, as shown in Figure 3 below. One might notice that the GET request in Figure 3\ndoes not start with a forward-slash \"/\" character and includes a back-slash character \"\\\" in the\nURL. This causes a legitimate web server, such as nginx used in our test environment, to\nrespond with a '400 Bad Request' error message. This may suggest that even though the\ncode in Figure 2 uses the HTTPConnection class from the httplib module to generate the\nanomalous HTTP beacon, it is likely that the threat actors created a custom server to handle\nthis C2 channel instead of relying on a standard web server.\n\nAdditionally, Figure 2 shows that the malware author used the variable name 'cmd' to build\nthe string used for the HTTP method and path and checks the HTTP method portion of the\nstring for the word 'exit'. We are unsure of the purpose of this check, as the HTTP method in\nthis string would never be 'exit' and therefore would never be true. We believe this is an\nartifact likely derived from a previous version of the script that the author forgot to remove.\n\nFigure 3. Example HTTP request issued by Trojan in test environment\n\n\n-----\n\nIf the C2 server were to accept the beacon in Figure 3, it would respond with HTML that\ncontains a command intended for the Trojan to parse and execute. The Trojan begins by\nconverting the HTML in the response to text using the code seen in Figure 4 below. The\nHTML to text code in Figure 4 is available in several locations on the Internet, but it appears\nto have possibly originated from a discussion at Stack Overflow titled Extracting text from\nHTML file using Python, which may be where the malware author obtained this code.\n\nFigure 4. HTML to text code in Trojan possibly obtained from Stack Overflow discussion\n\nAfter converting the HTML to text, the Trojan discards the first 10 characters of the response\nand treats the remainder of the string as a command. The C2 can also provide the string\n\"yes \" in this command string, which instructs the Trojan to decode the command as a\nbase16 encoded string with the \"yes \" substring removed. The Trojan subjects the command\nsupplied by the C2 to a handler that determines the activities the Trojan will perform. Table 1\nshows a list of commands available within the Trojan's command handler and the\ncorresponding activities. The commands in the command handler provides the necessary\nfunctionality for Chafer to interact with the remote system.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Command** **Description**\n\nTerminate Terminates the connection\n\ndownload Downloads provided <filename> that it will obtain from http://<c2\nserver>/<filename> and saves it to C:\\Users\\Public\\<filename>.\n\nruntime Sets the sleep interval between beacons.\n\nupload Uploads provided <filename> to http://<c2 server> via HTTP POST.\n\ncd Changes the current working directory\n\nempty Does nothing, likely an Idle command.\n\n\n<anything\nelse>\n\n\nAttempts to run the supplied data as a command on the command line.\n\n\n_Table 1. Commands available in Trojan’s command handler_\n\nWe gained more insight into the custom C2 server application by analyzing the activities that\nMechaFlounder carries out if it receives the ‘upload’ command. To upload a specified file\nfrom the compromised system to the C2 server, the Trojan uses the Browser class in the\nmechanize module (partial basis of the MechaFlounder name) to submit the file to an HTML\nform on the C2 server. This suggests that in addition to being able to handle the anomalous\nHTTP GET requests previously mentioned, the custom C2 server application must also be\nable to:\n\n1. Serve HTML that contains a form to receive uploaded files,\n2. Handle legitimate HTTP POST requests generated by the mechanize module, and\n3. Save files uploaded with the HTTP POST request.\n\nAfter carrying out the activities for the command, the Trojan will encode the results or output\nmessage of the command using the 'base64.b16encode' method. Each command has an\noutput message for both a successful and failed execution of the command with the\nexception of ‘empty’ and ‘terminate’. Table 2 below shows the success and failure messages\nassociated with each command.\n\n**Command** **Message type** **Output message structure**\n\ndownload Success <username>-<hostname>||download\n<filename>**download success\\n\n\nFail <exception message>||<username>-<hostname>**download failed,\ndownload <filename> \\n\n\n\n-----\n\nupload Success <username>--<hostname>||upload\n<filename>**upload success \\n\n\nFail (no file) <username>--<hostname >||\n<command issued>**no such file\\n\n\n\nFail\n(exception)\n\n\n<exception message>||<username>-<hostname>**upload failed,upload\n<filename> \\n\n\n\nruntime Success <interval>||<username>-<hostname>**runtime changed to\n<command issued>\n\nFail <username>--<hostname>||\n<command issued>**runtime\nchange failed because of large\nmount\n\ncd Success <username>--<hostname>||\n<command issued>**directory\nchanged success to <directory>\n\nFail <username>--<hostname>||\n<command issued>**Couldn\"t\nchange directory\n\n\n<anything\nelse>\n(command\nexecution)\n\n\nSuccess <username>--<hostname>||\n<command issued>**<command\nstdout>\n\n\nFail <username>--<hostname>||\n<command issued>**<command\nstderr>\n\nTable 2. Success and failure messages associated with commands\n\nUnlike the initial beacon that uses the anomalous HTTP GET request, the Trojan will send\nthe encoded results to the C2 server using the same socket as the initial HTTP beacon. The\nuse of the same socket and the anomalous portions of the HTTP beacon further suggests\nthat the threat actor likely created a custom C2 server to handle this network traffic.\n\nTo show these network communications, we patched the Trojan to issue beacons that use\nlegitimate HTTP GET requests that the HTTP server (nginx) in our test environment could\nsupport. The patches involved changing the paths within the HTTP request, specifically\nsetting the path to start with a forward-slash “/” and have the forward-slash “/” instead of a\n\n\n-----\n\nback-splash \\ within the URL path itself. In our test environment, we added the string\n“0123456789runtime 5” to the file ‘rob--rob-virtual-machine-service.html’ in the ‘rob--robvirtual-machine’ folder.\n\nWhen the Trojan issues the beacon, the HTTP server responds with contents of the ‘rob-rob-virtual-machine-service.html’ file, which effectively issues a command to the Trojan. The\nTrojan responds to the command ‘runtime 5’ with the message \"5||rob--rob-virtualmachine**runtime changed to runtime 5\" that it encodes in base16. It then sends this to the\nC2 server without any HTTP headers using the same socket as the initial HTTP request.\n\nFigure 5 shows the TCP session showing the initial beacon sent from the patched Trojan, the\nHTTP server responding with a command, and the Trojan responding to the command all in\nthe same TCP session.\n\nFigure 5. Single TCP Session used by the Trojan to receive commands and send command\nresults to the C2\n\n## And one more thing...\n\nIf you think you’ve seen the “&m=d” parameter before, you’d be correct. The “&m=d”\nparameter seen in the initial download URL of the MechaFlounder payload appears in many\nURLs related to both Chafer and OilRig threat groups. This parameter has been seen in\nVBScript downloader payloads installed by delivery documents associated with both Oilrig\nand Chafer. We have also seen this parameter used in URLs generated by Chafer’s AutoIT\npayload The VBScript and AutoIT payloads also share common variable names and the\n\n\n-----\n\nsame overall functionality, which suggests there may be some code sharing occurring\nbetween the two threat groups. Figure 6 below shows a VBScript run by an OilRig delivery\ndocument (SHA256:\n1b2fee00d28782076178a63e669d2306c37ba0c417708d4dc1f751765c3f94e1) on the left\ncompared to a Chafer AutoIT script (SHA256:\n332fab21cb0f2f50774fccf94fc7ae905a21b37fe66010dcef6b71c140bb7fa1) on the right,\nwhich have colored boxes surrounding code overlaps.\n\nUnfortunately, we are unable to ascertain the specifics between the code sharing between\nOilRig and Chafer. At this time, we are not combining the two threat groups together based\non these code overlaps.\n\n_Figure 6. Oilrig Clayside VBS | Chafer AutoIT_\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Chafer threat group has been active since at least 2015 focused on both private and\npublic sector entities within the Middle East. Unit 42 has specifically observed the targeting of\nTurkish government entities since at least 2016; however, this is the first instance where Unit\n42 has observed Chafer using a Python-based payload. This payload, now known as\nMechaFlounder was created by Chafer using a combination of actor developed code and\ncode snippets freely available online in development communities. The MechaFlounder\nTrojan contains enough functionality for the Chafer actors to carry out the necessary\nactivities needed to accomplish their goals, specifically by supporting file upload and\ndownload, as well as command execution functionality.\n\nThe overlap in Oilrig’s Clayside VBScript and Chafer’s AutoIT payloads does not come as a\ncomplete surprise. Oilrig and Chafer have for quite some time appeared very similar\noperationally and potentially having access to the same code or resources for payload\ndevelopment makes sense. Unit 42 has taken reference to the various overlaps in the two\nsets of activities and continues to track these operations separately.\n\n\n-----\n\nPalo Alto Networks customers are protected against this threat in the following ways:\n\nWildFire detects MechaFlounder with a malicious verdict\nDomains identified as command and control servers are flagged as malicious\nAutoFocus tags: [https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.Mechaflounder](https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.Mechaflounder)\n\nPalo Alto Networks has shared our findings, including file samples and indicators of\ncompromise, in this report with our fellow Cyber Threat Alliance members.
