While this group has remained active, it appears that a number of\n[universities in the United Kingdom were recently infected with ransomware via an AdGholas](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-reference/ransomware)\ninfection chain, a marked departure from the banking Trojans this group usually distributes.\nAlthough the universities made headlines as a result of the infection, it appears that the attack\nwas far more widespread, with malvertising appearing on a number of high-profile websites.\n\n**Analysis**\n\nOn June 15, 2017, several universities in the United Kingdom reported that they were victims\nof a ransomware attack [2] [3]. We decided to investigate this and ensure we were protecting\nand alerting our customers appropriately.\n\nBecause little information was available, we first followed public indicators [1] that actually\npointed to an unrelated spam campaign: we had already internally documented this campaign\nspreading Dridex botnet ID 2302. We were unable to detect email activity explaining the\nreported infections and turned to assessing the drive-by landscape for associated activity. The\nMagnitude infection chain continued to avoid the UK while still spreading Cerber in Taiwan\nand the Republic of Korea. We also ensured that the EITest [5] infection chain in the UK was\nnot redirecting to an exploit kit (EK). We were aware of an instance of RIG EK chain dropping\nGlobeImposter ransomware, but the scale did not match that of the outbreaks reported by the\nUK universities.\n\nAt this point, we began to consider whether AdGholas [11] into Astrum EK (also known as\nStegano EK [12] [9]) might be the infection vector, despite the fact that the ransomware\npayload was inconsistent with the activity of their usual customers who normally spread\n[banking malware.](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-reference/malware)\n\n\n-----\n\nWe then learned that the command and control (C&C) IP address for the reported\n[ransomware (137.74.163[.]43) was a Mole Ransomware C&C based on ET Intelligence portal](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/products/et-intelligence)\ndata. This also matched other forensic information from the events.\n\n_Figure 1: ET Pro data for 137.74.163[.]43_\n\nWe searched for malware samples contacting this IP and found two, both of which had\nsubmission filenames to VirusTotal (mopslb.tmp and ldmso.tmp) that were consistent with an\nAstrum payload name on disk.\n\nAt that stage, we were almost convinced the events were tied to AdGholas / Astrum EK ([11]\n\n[12]) activity. We confirmed this, however, via an HTTPS connection common to the\ncompromised host avia-book[.]com. We had been tracking its activity for several days with\ncolleagues at Trend Micro and contacts in the Advertising industry.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2: Three AdGholas banners in use, captured June 9, 2017_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3: Air booking template in use by Avia-Book; this is not seen by users but aimed at ad_\n_agencies, captured June 9, 2017_\n\nThis host was used in malvertising campaign targeting a number of countries: Great Britain,\nAustralia, Canada, Italy, Monaco, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, and Switzerland. Later, the host\nwas also used in Japan, Taiwan, and the United States. We received confirmation that all of\nthe compromised hosts also contacted the current Astrum IP, 185.45.193[.]123.\n\nWe attempted to replicate the infection chain and successfully witnessed AdGholas activity but\nwere not able to trigger the EK redirection.\n\n_Figure 4: AdGholas activity captured live on June 16, 2017_\n\n_Figure 5: AdGholas Malvertising Chain with involved nodes highlighted, captured June 16,_\n_2017_\n\nHowever, while we did not capture the redirection in our lab systems, we know this\nconditionally leads to Astrum hosted with full HTTPS support on the host\n185.45.193[.]123. [13]\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6: A Let’s Encrypt Certificate used by Astrum - June 15, 2017_\n\nAstrum tried HTTPS between March 30 and April 4, 2017, before adopting it permanently at\nthe end of May. Known CVEs used by Astrum include CVE-2016-0189 [7], CVE-2016-1019\n\n[6], and CVE-2016-4117 [8]. The introduction of Diffie-Hellman [9] suggests that there might\n\n\n-----\n\nbe a new exploit the actors are trying to hide in this chain. Obtaining the patch state of the\ncompromised hosts would help rule out this possibility.\n\nIt appears that between June 14 and 15, Astrum was dropping Mole ransomware in the United\nKingdom and likely in the US [4]. Mole is a member of the CryptFile2/CryptoMix ransomware\nfamily. We do not know the payloads in other countries, but, based on past activity, we are\nconfident they were banking Trojans. Unlike ransomware, bankers are generally less noisy\nand often remain unnoticed by victims.\n\n_Figure 7: Sample of documented Astrum activity_\n\n_Figure 8: _HELP_INSTRUCTION.TXT dropped by Mole ransomware on victim machines_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 9: Mole Ransomware Payment Server - June 15, 2017_\n\n_Figure 10: Mole FILEs RETURN! Email - June 15, 2017_\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAdGholas malvertising redirecting to the Astrum Exploit Kit is the most evolved blind mass\ninfection chain known today. Full HTTPS, heavy smart filtering, domain shadowing, DiffieHellman, and perfect knowledge of how the Advertising industry operates allow these threat\nactors to lure large agencies to bring them high volumes of traffic from high-value website and\ntargets.\n\n\n-----\n\nMoreover, it is worth remembering that a common misperception about drive-by malvertising\nattacks remains prevalent: there is no need to click on the advertisement to be infected. It is\n_enough simply to display the ad: if the machine is vulnerable and targeted, then the infection_\noccurs without any user interaction.\n\n**Acknowledgements**\n\n[We would like to thank first our colleagues Joseph C.
