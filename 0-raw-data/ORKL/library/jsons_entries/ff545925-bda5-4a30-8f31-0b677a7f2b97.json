(which changes often upon detection).\n\nAfter investigating Attackers Servers and Malicious Files, we have linked this Cyber Attack to\nRussian Official Security Agencies.\n\n**2 | P a g e**\n\n\n-----\n\n### After Analysing Webserver, Malicious Files and Various Scripts we found out that:\n\n 1. Some of the Georgian NEWS-related sites were Hacked. \n\n (The Malicious script was injected only in the pages, where SPECIFIC information was presented)\n\n 2. After visiting this pages Computer was infected by Unknown Malicious\n Program.\n\n    (None of Antivirus Product could Identify the threat, by the time of discovery).\n\n 3. When executed, Malicious File Fully Controls Infected Computers.\n\n 4. Searches for the “Sensitive words” into the Document Files.\n\n 5. Makes Video and Audio Capture using built-in camera and microphone.\n\n**3 | P a g e**\n\n\n-----\n\n### Targeted Audience\n\nCyber Attack was designed very smartly. Various Georgian News-Related web-sites were\nhacked and modified only Specific News pages (eg. **_NATO delegation Visit in Georgia, US-_**\n**_Georgian Agreements and Meetings, Georgian Military NEWS)._**\n\nOnly the persons who was interested in such information were infected with this Advanced\nThreat, despite of Security Defensive measure’s and Software used on targets Computer and\nNetwork Systems. Threat was highly encrypted and used contemporary stealthy techniques, so\nthat none of security tools could identify it.\n\n## www.caucasustimes.com – Site about NEWS from Caucasian Region www.cei.ge             – Caucasus Energy and Infrastructure www.psnews.ge         -

Canada, Ukraine, France, China 3% - Germany 3% - Russia\n\nExample of infected Computer from United States\n\n**8 | P a g e**\n\n\n-----\n\n### Malicious file was evolving and Developed time to time:\n\n 30 March, 2011 – Virus Steals Sensitive Documents, Certificates\n\n 14 September 2011 – Changed Infection Mechanism, new Bypassing methods for the (Antivirus/Firewall/IDS) \n\n 25 November 2011 – Virus is more encrypted and obfuscated. infects windows 7 Operating System \n\n 12 December 2011 – added Video Recording capability, scanning and infecting computers through the Network, changed Spreading vector\n\n It had been evolved from 2.1 version to 5.5. \n\n**9 | P a g e**\n\n\n-----\n\n### INFECTING MECHANISM\n\n 1) Injected script or iframe into Legitimate Web-site 2) Frame.php from iframe – contained (exploit pack) 3) Drive-By Download & Execution of calc.exe 4) Calc.exe self-destruction injecting code into Explorer.exe 5) Creating persistant usbserv.exe virus\n\n Step 1- injected script\n\n**10 | P a g e**\n\n\n-----\n\n### shellcode inside frame.php         /   exploit pack files\n\n**11 | P a g e**\n\n\n-----\n\n**1)** We found out that there is crafted and obfuscated frame.php file, which carries some exploit code\n\nand redirects users to other exploit pages:\n\nIt uses CVE-2010-0842,  CVE-2006-3730, MS06-057 and other unknown vulnerabilities.\n\n**2)** Exploit code used in frame.php is crypted version of TrojanDownloader:JS/SetSlice, which exploits\n\nMS06-057 Vulnerability by using 'WebViewFolderIcon' ActiveX control (Web View).\n\n**3)** Also there was some 0day exploit used for exploitation through PDF, JAR files.\n\n**Malicious Files Not detected with Major Antivirus Products**\n\n**(1/47 Virustoal, Dr.Web result – suspicious)**\n\n**Bypasses Windows 7 sp1 patched with Firewall enabled.**\n\n**As of 25.03.2011,   20.06.2011,  16.01.2012,  25.03.2012**\n\n### After Executing Malware does 3 major things:  \n\n - Before installing bot checks if the computer is located in UTC+3, UTC+4\n\n Time-zone:\n\n - injects itself into iexplorer.exe and\n\n communicating to defaced sites, for\n\n C&C address retrival\n\n - creating usbserv.exe bot file in\n\n Application Data directory, and\n\n writing it to autorun in Windows\n\n Registry.\n\n**12 | P a g e**\n\n\n-----\n\n### Bot Control Mechanism\n\n 1) C&C servers Addresses are written into Malware’s Binary file 2) If all of them are unreachable malware reads special html page header, \n which actually is html page defaced on, one of the Georgian Governmental Web-Site:\n\n**13 | P a g e**\n\n\n-----\n\n##     NEW METHOD OF MALWARE UPDATING\n\n### New version of Malware file is downloaded as base64 encoded plain text from different servers simultaneously and then assembled into one file.\n\n**14 | P a g e**\n\n\n-----\n\n## Unique Characteristics\n\n###  1) Searching Sensitive word’s In filenames and INTO pdf, word, xls, txt, rtf, ppt     Documents. \n\n  2) Recording Videos from Webcam : During skype conversation, live streaming   capability\n\n   3) Modify malware code file from C&C Web Panel\n\n   4) Self-Created Packer, Crypter in Assembler Language (evading A/V)\n\n   5) Update mechanism, Base-encoded plaintext, simultaneously from different C&C servers. (evading IPS/IDS)\n\n   6) opening network socket at ring0 level (evading firewall) / TDSS Rootkit\n\n Modification\n\n**15 | P a g e**\n\n\n-----\n\n## Infected Organisations\n\n### Most Georgian Infected computers were from our Governmental Agencies and \n Critical Information Infrastructures\n\n Targets:\n\n 1) Ministries \n\n 2) Parliament\n\n 3) Critical Information Ifrastructures\n\n 4) Banks\n\n 5) NGO’s\n\n**16 | P a g e**\n\n\n-----\n\n### Responding Steps\n\n 1) Blocked each of 6 C&C IP addresses, upon detection, through Country’s 3 main Internet Service Providers.  (Immediate Response)\n\n 2) CERT-GOV-GE identified all Georgian infected IP’s and gave mitigation strategies and cleaning tools to Infected Agencies and Institutions.\n\n 3) Cooperated with Antivirus, IDS/IPS solutions, to create mitigating tools and signatures. (Microsoft, Eset, Snort, Cisco, various Blacklists, Blocklists)\n\n 4) Cooperated with FBI, Department of Homeland Security, US Secret Service, US- CERT, Governmental-CERT-Germany, CERT-Ukraine, CERT-Polska, Microsoft Cybersecurity Division\n\n 5) Hosting Providers Abuse Teams, to shut down attacking servers. \n\n 6) Law Enforcement Agencies to obtain log files and system images for Forensic Analysis.\n\n**17 | P a g e**\n\n\n-----\n\n### Counter Cyber-Intelligence \n**(unmasking the attackers)**\n\nCERT-GOV-GE gained full access to Command and Control servers, Decrypted communication\nmechanisms and malicious files. After Analyzing all the gathered information we have\nidentified Cyber attacker persons and organizations.\n\n_“During 2008 Cyber War between Russia and Georgia, two Independent US-based Organizations linked Cyber Attackers_\n_with Russian Official Ministries and Organizations._\n\n_“United States Cyber Consequences Unit” and  “Project_ **_Grey Goose”_**\n\n_Jefrey Carr, GreyLogic (cyber Intelligence services for Government Sector)_\n_Sanjay Goel, New York State Center for Information Forensics and Assurance_\n_Mike Himley, CEO/President of Eagle Intelligence_\n\n_They investigated entire Cyber Attack against Georgia and linked 2008 Cyber Attacks with so-called Cyber-Criminals Group_\n_“Russian Business Network”,_\n\n_They had reported, that Some of used Internet Resources and Credentials belonged with “Russian Ministry of Defense Research_\n_Institute” called – Center for Research of Military Strength of Foreign Countries.”_\n\n### In 2011-2012, During This New Cyber Espionage Attack, we have identified Russian Security agencies, once again.\n\n**18 | P a g e**\n\n\n-----\n\nWe have found: **_3 main facts, which indicate to Russian Official State organizations._**\n\nWarynews.ru – site used to control infected Georgian computers – IP and DNS servers\nbelonges to Russian Business Network. (mentioned in various Blacklist, Bad Reputation)\n\nwww.rbc.ru – written directly into MALWARE code, to communicate with Attackers if every\ncommunication channel is closed.
