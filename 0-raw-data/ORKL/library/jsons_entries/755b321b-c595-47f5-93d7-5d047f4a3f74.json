    "plain_text": "# Winnti Evolution - Going Open Source\n\n\n###### BACK TO BLOG POSTS\n\n**ProtectWise recently observed a burst of activity and change of tactics from an advanced actor group**\n**commonly referred to as “Winnti.” The purpose of this post is to share details of the group’s recent activity in**\n**an effort to assist the public in searching for related activity in their networks and preventing future attacks.**\n\n## About Winnti\n\n**The Winnti group has been active since roughly 2010. Significant previous research has been published on�**\n**[the group from a variety of sources, such as Kaspersky, Blue Coat, and TrendMicro. As far back as 2011,](https://kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/vlpdfs/winnti-more-than-just-a-game-130410.pdf)**\n**the group was detected attacking multiple video game studios, including some in South Korea and Japan,**\n**likely attempting to steal various in-game currencies and to compromise developers’ certificates and source�**\n**code.**\n\n### Objectives:\n\n**Theft of digital certificates�**\n**Use of stolen certificates to sign malware�**\n**Theft of gaming source code and infrastructure details**\n\n### TTPs:\n\n\n# Winnti Evolution - Going Open Source\n\n\n-----\n\n**Phishing HR/recruiting emails for initial infection vector**\n**CHM email file attachments containing malware�**\n**Use of GitHub for C2 communication**\n\n### Targets:\n\n**Online video game organizations**\n**Defense Sector**\n**Internet Service Providers**\n\n### Attribution:\n\n**Originating Location: China (high confidence)�**\n**Potential Aliases: Wicked Panda, APT17**\n\n## Evolution of Winnti - Open source tools, and macOS targeting:\n\n**Within the Winnti campaigns observed by ProtectWise, the use of open source tooling was common.**\n**Specifically, the group has been utilizing the Browser Exploitation Framework (BeEF) and Metasploit�**\n**Meterpreter. The use of open source tools by advanced actor groups has become increasingly common, as**\n**[discussed by our colleagues in the industry. To the best of our knowledge, this is a new technique for the](http://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/nation-state-hackers-go-open-source/d/d-id/1328619)**\n**Winnti group and we expect it to be used in future attacks.**\n\n**Also noteworthy are attempts to deliver JAR files containing macOS applications which have meterpreter�**\n**functionality. In addition, victims running Windows were delivered MSI files which were built using a free�**\n**[EXE to MSI converter (http://www.exetomsi.com/).](http://www.exetomsi.com/)**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 1: Summary of attack progression._**\n\n## Delivery:\n\n**The Winnti campaign detailed in this post began with spear phishing emails aimed at a Japanese gaming**\n**studio’s staff. At least one of these emails claimed it was from an applicant for a job posting who was listing**\n**their relevant experience, along with a link to their resume.**\n\n**_Figure 2: Winnti Phishing Email._**\n\n**The approximate translation of the Winnti phishing email is as follows:**\n\n**“I saw your job posting. My main languages are Object-C, JAVA, and Swift, and I have 7 years**\n**experience with Ruby and 6 years experience with PHP. I have 5 years experience developing iOS**\n**apps, as well as Android apps, AWS, Jenkins, Microsoft Azure, ZendFramework, and smartphone**\n**application payment processing. I also have 5 years experience with MSSQL, Mysql, Oracle, and**\n\n\n-----\n\n**was directed to an HTML page which loaded a fake English resume. In the second technique, which we**\n**only observed a few times, the landing page directly downloaded a JAR file to the victim’s machine.�**\n\n**_Figure 3: Fake resume loaded in a browser. Some items blurred as content may have been stolen._**\n\n**_Figure 4: Fake resume continued_**\n\n\n-----\n\n## g\n\n**In cases where the above resume is loaded, it is delivered as follows:**\n\n**{Phishing Email Link}/?session={date}{ID}**\n\n**This page is an HTML file containing a simple iframe instruction to load real.html.�**\n\n**_Figure 5: Link-click landing page HTML content._**\n\n**real.html**\n\n**This is the HTML file containing the fake resume which will load in a browser for the link-click victim. It�**\n**contains a script which loads the BeEF hook script from a separate external host. The group’s infrastructure**\n**changes rapidly, occasionally allowing us to observe them modifying the hook page destination domain over**\n**the span of a few minutes.**\n\n**Sometimes the same destination would be referred to by IP in one version of real.html and by hostname in**\n**another. Two additional files, resume_screen.css and mypic.jpg, are also loaded to make the resume look�**\n**more realistic with improved formatting.**\n\n**_Figure 6: Added hook.js load request placed in a fake resume._**\n\n**At this point, in cases where BeEF has been used, exploits are typically attempted on victim hosts with the**\n**[help of BeEF modules. A commonly used module was Jenkins_groovy_code_exec.](https://github.com/beefproject/beef/tree/master/modules/exploits/jenkins_groovy_code_exec)**\n\n## Evasion Techniques:\n\n**One of the Winnti group’s distinctive techniques is their particular style of DNS resolution for their C2**\n**domains. Choosing domain names which are similar to valid domains (for example, google-statics[.]com, a**\n**misspelling of Google statistics, instead of analytics.google.com), the group configures their DNS so that the�**\n**root domain resolves to either nothing, or localhost (previous research has observed the root domain**\n**resolving to the valid domain it is imitating; we did not observe that in this campaign).**\n\n**Then a subdomain resolves to an actual C2 server. For example, google-statics[.]com, one of the C2**\n**domains observed in this campaign has no resolutions at the time of writing. css.google-statics[.]com,**\n**however, resolves to a real C2 IP.**\n\n**As observed in previous Winnti attacks, the group uses commonly accepted and poorly monitored protocols**\n**and ports for their C2 communication (ports 53, 80, 443). With the addition of BeEF, the group has made use**\n**of TCP port 8000 as well. Amusingly, the group's use of BeEF has been fairly rudimentary, not even taking**\n**advantage of the basic obfuscation features included in the program. We observed the group using**\n**GAGAHOOK instead of the default BEEFHOOK session name and BEEFSESSION session cookie name.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 7: BeEF hook.js request._**\n\n**As in previous Winnti campaigns, the group continues to use legitimate code signing certificates, stolen from�**\n**online gaming organizations, to sign their malware. This technique can help to hide the malicious intent of**\n**the group’s code, allowing it to run in environments where execution is restricted to signed/trusted**\n**programs. While unconfirmed as of this writing, we believe the Winnti group is continuing to steal and use�**\n**certificates from new organizations.�**\n\n## Associated Indicators:\n\n**Note: We are redacting the malware hashes while we work with the organization whose digital signature was**\n**used on the malware as a potential victim of the Winnti group.**\n\n**Indicator** **Type** **Description**\n\n**job.yoyakuweb[.]technology** **Domain** **Phishing email link destination.**\n\n**resume.immigrantlol[.]com** **Domain** **Phishing email link destination.**\n\n**macos.exoticlol[.]com** **Domain** **Likely phishing email link destination.**\n\n**css.google-statics[.]com** **Domain** **BeEF Landing and C2.**\n\n**minami[.]cc** **Domain** **Potential BeEF - Low confidence (Linode)�**\n\n**vps2java.securitytactics[.]com** **Domain** **Malware C2**\n\n**106.184.5.252** **IP** **Phishing email link destination.**\n\n**61.78.62.21** **IP** **Used in BeEF C2, reused Winnit Infra.**\n\n**139.162.106.19** **IP** **Linode - Used in BeEF C2.**\n\n**172.104.101.131** **IP** **Linode - Malware C2.**\n\n**139.162.17.161** **IP** **Linode - Used in BeEF C2.**\n\n**133.242.145.137** **IP** **Linode - Used in BeEF C2.**\n\n**106.185.31.128** **IP** **Linode - hosting BeEF landings.**\n\n**TOM HEGEL, SENIOR THREAT RESEARCHER & NATE MARX, ASSOCIATE THREAT RESEARCHER**\n\n#### Threat Research\n\n|Indicator|Type|Description|\n|---|---|---|\n|job.yoyakuweb[.]technology|Domain|Phishing email link destination.|\n|resume.immigrantlol[.]com|Domain|Phishing email link destination.|\n|macos.exoticlol[.]com|Domain|Likely phishing email link destination.|\n|css.google-statics[.]com|Domain|BeEF Landing and C2.|\n|minami[.]cc|Domain|Potential BeEF - Low confidence (Linode)�|\n|vps2java.securitytactics[.]com|Domain|Malware C2|\n|106.184.5.252|IP|Phishing email link destination.|\n|61.78.62.21|IP|Used in BeEF C2, reused Winnit Infra.|\n|139.162.106.19|IP|Linode - Used in BeEF C2.|\n|172.104.101.131|IP|Linode - Malware C2.|\n|139.162.17.161|IP|Linode - Used in BeEF C2.|\n|133.242.145.137|IP|Linode - Used in BeEF C2.|\n|106.185.31.128|IP|Linode - hosting BeEF landings.|\n\n\n-----\n\n**[SHARE]**\n\n\n#### SIGN UP FOR BLOG UPDATES\n\n\n**ENTER YOUR EMAIL HERE**\n\n\n##### SIGN UP\n\n\n#### FEATURED POSTS\n\n###### Webinar Recap: See Clearly and Respond Quickly from the Network to the Endpoint\n\n**David Gold**\n\n###### WannaCry Ransomware Review and Global Impact\n\n**Tom Hegel**\n\n###### Building a Great Threat Hunting Practice in the Cloud\n\n**James Condon**\n\n#### BLOG CATEGORIES\n\n###### Perspectives\n\n Threat Research\n\n Events\n\n Partners\n\n\n-----\n\n-----",
