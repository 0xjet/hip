Federal officials and cybersecurity experts are especially concerned that\nransomware attacks — even ones that don’t intentionally target election infrastructure —\ncould [disrupt voting and damage confidence in the integrity of the Nov. 3 election.](https://apnews.com/article/ap-top-news-technology-politics-elections-election-2020-b39a09fc9a1334e9ef78bd46a40db253)\n\nThe Oct. 7 attack on Hall County, in the northern part of the state, hit critical systems and\ninterrupted phone services, the county said in a statement posted on its website. County\nspokeswoman Katie Crumley did not return multiple requests for comment from The\nAssociated Press.\n\n\n-----\n\nBut according to a [report in the Gainesville Times, the attack also disabled the county s voter](https://www.gainesvilletimes.com/news/politics/how-hall-county-handling-influx-absentee-ballots/)\n[signature database. Crumley was also quoted in an online CNN story saying that the attack](https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/22/tech/ransomware-election-georgia/index.html)\naffected both the signature database and a voting precinct map.\n\nRansomware scrambles affected computer networks with encryption that can only be\n[unlocked with keys provided once the victim has paid up. Deloitte analyst Srini Subramanian](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/profiles/ssubramanian.html)\nsaid ransoms local governments pay in such cases average about $400,000.\n\nAn update Thursday evening on the county website said “the voting process for citizens has\nnot been impacted by the attack.” However, a county official quoted by the Times said\nsignature verification was slowed because employees had to manually pull hard copies of\nvoter registration cards in many cases. The official was quoted as saying that most voter\nsignatures could still be verified using a state database unaffected by the attack. The county\nhas 129,000 registered voters.\n\nIn most states, signatures are used to validate absentee ballots sent by mail. Written on the\nenvelopes that sheath the ballots, they are matched by election workers against signatures\non file with state and local election authorities.\n\n[Federal officials recently announced that Russian hackers have infiltrated dozens of state](https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-iran-media-social-media-elections-8cccec2bd393098f9fb39b955ae52bde)\n[and local government networks and could be poised to launch disruptive attacks.](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-296a)\n\nAn international ransomware syndicate known as Doppelpaymer appears to be involved in\nthe Hall County attack. It posted documents purportedly stolen from Hall County on a dark\nweb site as proof of responsibility.\n\nCrumley, the county spokeswoman, did not respond to an email asking how much ransom\nthat attackers had demanded and whether the county had paid a ransom.\n\nBrett Callow, a threat analyst at Emsisoft cybersecurity firm, said the attack could augur other\nsimilar actions exploiting the proximity of Election Day.\n\n“The real question is how many local government networks are already compromised?\nThreat actors frequently delay deploying ransomware on compromised networks until what\nthey consider to be the most opportune moment — and that may well be in the days\nimmediately prior to the election,” he said. “What better time to extort money from a\ngovernment by holding its systems hostage than when those systems are most needed?”\n\nA worsening ransomware plague is afflicting U.S. cities, counties and school districts,\nexacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAt least 82 government bodies in the U.S. have been hit by ransomware so far this year.\nEighteen of those incidents have occurred since the beginning of September, according to\nEmsisoft.\n\n\n-----\n\nAll contents © copyright 2022 The Associated Press.
