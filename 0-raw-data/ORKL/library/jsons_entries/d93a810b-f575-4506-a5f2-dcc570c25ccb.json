Pony Stealer is very dangerous and once it infects a PC it will turn the device into a\nbotnet, allowing it to use the PCs it infects to infect other PCs.\n\n[Pony Stealer, which is tied closely to Reveton worm, is also well-known for spreading](https://www.knowbe4.com/reveton-worm?hsLang=en)\nmalware, thanks to an e-mail campaign that was started in late 2014. The e-mail is\nsupposedly sent from the shipping company Maersk Line. The writer of this e-mail informs\npotential victims that they have an overdue invoice from an account with the company. The\nvictims are then provided with a link to a PDF download so they can download the overdue\ninvoice and then pay for what they owe. Toward the end of the e-mail, victims are provided\nwith phone numbers for a “sales representative” and the Maersk customer service line—and\nboth of these phone numbers have a Vietnamese area code. In an effort to make the e-mail\nseem more legitimate, the writer provides the URL of Maersk’s official website.\n\nA quick inspection would reveal that, while Maersk does have a way to contact their\nVietnamese branch, the phone number on their official website is completely different from\nthe ones provided in the e-mail. Furthermore, in January 2014, Maersk warned their\ncustomers about the fraud, instructing them not to click the suspicious links in the e-mails\nand not to provide anyone with security information like account passwords.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Is Your Network Vulnerable To Ransomware Attacks?\n\nFind out now with KnowBe4's Ransomware Simulator \"RanSim\", get your results in minutes.\n\n« [Back To Ransomware Knowledgebase](https://www.knowbe4.com/ransomware-knowledgebase?hsLang=en)\n\n### Get the latest about social engineering\n\n**Subscribe to CyberheistNews**\n\n\n-----",
