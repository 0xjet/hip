    "plain_text": "# Taking Action Against Hackers in Bangladesh and Vietnam\n\n**[about.fb.com/news/2020/12/taking-action-against-hackers-in-bangladesh-and-vietnam/](https://about.fb.com/news/2020/12/taking-action-against-hackers-in-bangladesh-and-vietnam/)**\n\nApril 7, 2022\n\nToday, we’re sharing actions we took against two separate groups of hackers — APT32 in\nVietnam and a group based in Bangladesh — removing their ability to use their infrastructure\nto abuse our platform, distribute malware and hack people’s accounts across the internet.\n\nFacebook’s threat intelligence analysts and security experts work to find and stop a wide\n[range of threats including malware campaigns,](https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-shut-down-malware-that-hijacked-accounts-to-run-ads/) [influence operations and hacking of our](https://about.fb.com/news/tag/coordinated-inauthentic-behavior/)\nplatform or individual Facebook accounts by nation state adversaries, hackers and others.\nAs part of these efforts, our teams routinely disrupt adversary operations by disabling them,\nnotifying users if they should take steps to protect their accounts, sharing our findings\npublicly and continuing to improve the security of our products.\n\nToday we’re sharing our latest research and enforcement actions against attempts to\ncompromise people’s accounts and gain access to their information, commonly referred to as\ncyber espionage. These two unconnected groups targeted people on our platform and\nelsewhere on the internet using very different tactics. The operation from Vietnam focused\nprimarily on spreading malware to its targets, whereas the operation from Bangladesh\nfocused on compromising accounts across platforms and coordinating reporting to get\ntargeted accounts and Pages removed from Facebook.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe people behind these operations are persistent adversaries, and we expect them to\nevolve their tactics. However, our detection systems and threat investigators, as well as other\nteams in the security community, keep improving to make it harder for them to remain\nundetected. We will continue to share our findings whenever possible so people are aware of\nthe threats we are seeing and can take steps to strengthen the security of their accounts.\n\n## Here’s What We Found\n\n**Bangladesh**\n\nThe Bangladesh-based group targeted local activists, journalists and religious minorities,\nincluding those living abroad, to compromise their accounts and have some of them disabled\nby Facebook for violating our Community Standards. Our investigation linked this activity to\ntwo non-profit organizations in Bangladesh: Don’s Team (also known as Defense of Nation)\nand the Crime Research and Analysis Foundation (CRAF). They appeared to be operating\nacross a number of internet services.\n\nDon’s Team and CRAF collaborated to report people on Facebook for fictitious violations of\nour Community Standards, including alleged impersonation, intellectual property\ninfringements, nudity and terrorism. They also hacked people’s accounts and Pages, and\nused some of these compromised accounts for their own operational purposes, including to\namplify their content. On at least one occasion, after a Page admin’s account was\ncompromised, they removed the remaining admins to take over and disable the Page. Our\ninvestigation suggests that these targeted hacking attempts were likely carried out through a\nnumber of off-platform tactics including email and device compromise and abuse of our\naccount recovery process.\n\nTo disrupt this activity, we removed the accounts and Pages behind this operation. We\nshared information about this group with our industry partners so they too can detect and\n[stop this activity. We encourage people to remain vigilant and take steps to protect their](https://www.facebook.com/help/213481848684090?helpref=related&ref=related&source_cms_id=235353253505947)\naccounts, avoid clicking on suspicious links and downloading software from untrusted\nsources that can compromise their devices and information stored on them.\n\n**Vietnam**\n\nAPT32, an advanced persistent threat actor based in Vietnam, targeted Vietnamese human\nrights activists locally and abroad, various foreign governments including those in Laos and\nCambodia, non-governmental organizations, news agencies and a number of businesses\nacross information technology, hospitality, agriculture and commodities, hospitals, retail, the\nauto industry, and mobile services with malware. Our investigation linked this activity to\nCyberOne Group, an IT company in Vietnam (also known as CyberOne Security, CyberOne\nTechnologies, Hành Tinh Company Limited, Planet and Diacauso).\n\n\n-----\n\nAs our industry partners have previously reported, APT32 has deployed a wide range of\nadversarial tactics across the internet. We have been tracking and taking action against this\ngroup for several years. Our most recent investigation analyzed a number of notable tactics,\ntechniques and procedures (TTPs) including:\n\n**Social engineering: APT32 created fictitious personas across the internet posing as**\nactivists and business entities, or used romantic lures when contacting people they\ntargeted. These efforts often involved creating backstops for these fake personas and\nfake organizations on other internet services so they appear more legitimate and can\nwithstand scrutiny, including by security researchers. Some of their Pages were\ndesigned to lure particular followers for later phishing and malware targeting.\n**Malicious Play Store apps: In addition to using Pages, APT32 lured targets to**\ndownload Android applications through Google Play Store that had a wide range of\npermissions to allow broad surveillance of peoples’ devices.\n**Malware propagation: APT32 compromised websites and created their own to include**\nobfuscated malicious javascript as part of their watering hole attack to track targets’\nbrowser information. A watering hole attack is when hackers infect websites frequently\nvisited by intended targets to compromise their devices. As part of this, the group built\ncustom malware capable of detecting the type of operating system a target uses\n(Windows or Mac) before sending a tailored payload that executes the malicious code.\nConsistent with this group’s past activity, APT32 also used links to file-sharing services\nwhere they hosted malicious files for targets to click and download. Most recently, they\nused shortened links to deliver malware. Finally, the group relied on Dynamic-Link\nLibrary (DLL) side-loading attacks in Microsoft Windows applications. They developed\nmalicious files in exe, rar, rtf and iso formats, and delivered benign Word documents\ncontaining malicious links in text.\n\nThe latest activity we investigated and disrupted has the hallmarks of a well-resourced and\npersistent operation focusing on many targets at once, while obfuscating their origin. We\nshared our findings including YARA rules and malware signatures with our industry peers so\nthey too can detect and stop this activity. To disrupt this operation, we blocked associated\ndomains from being posted on our platform, removed the group’s accounts and notified\npeople who we believe were targeted by APT32.\n\n**Threat Indicators:**\n\n**Hashes**\n```\n768510fa9eb807bba9c3dcb3c7f87b771e20fa3d81247539e9ea4349205e39eb\n69730f2c2bb9668a17f8dfa1f1523e0e1e997ba98f027ce98f5cbaa869347383\n\n```\n**Domains**\n\n\n-----\n\n```\ntocaoonline[.]com\nqh2020[.]org\ntinmoivietnam[.]com\nnhansudaihoi13[.]org\nchatluongvacuocsong[.]vn\ntocaoonline[.]org\nfacebookdeck[.]com\nthundernews[.]org\n\n```\n**YARA Signatures**\n\nrule APT32_goopdate_installer\n```\nrule APT32_goopdate_installer {\n meta:\n  reference = “https://about.fb.com/news/2020/12/taking-action-against-hackers-inbangladesh-and-vietnam/”\n  author = “Facebook”\n  description = \"Detects APT32 installer side-loaded with goopdate.dll\"\n  sample = \"69730f2c2bb9668a17f8dfa1f1523e0e1e997ba98f027ce98f5cbaa869347383\"\n strings:\n  $s0 = { 68 ?? ?? ?? ?? 57 A3 ?? ?? ?? ??
