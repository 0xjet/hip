Long Live CryptBB?\n\n**ke-la.com/torum-is-dead-long-live-cryptbb/**\n\nAugust 24, 2020\n\nOn August 9, 2020, Torum’s administrator announced the forum is shutting down. What was\nthis forum, and will its users find alternatives? KELA explored various darknet sources, as\nwell as Torum itself, to find out. Here is a summary of our findings:\n\nTorum was an English-speaking underground forum that posed as a nonprofit\ncybersecurity website. While both its members and users of other forums agreed\nTorum was a good place to discuss cybersecurity and learn hacking methods, the\n**site was overwhelmed by newbies and scammers who damaged its reputation.**\n**Torum’s administrator announced he is closing the forum because he lost**\n**interest in supporting it.**\n**Torum was an active, stable community, which will likely be missed by users. The**\nforum has a few alternatives in the darknet, including CryptBB, which recently\n**became public. This post will explore what distinguished Torum and what darknet**\nchatter reveals about possible alternatives.\nAs users struggle to find new forums with a decent community, it is crucial to\n**continue tracking these sources to understand new trends and TTPs, and**\n**proactively mitigate potential risks emerging from them.**\n\n\n-----\n\n_The announcement of Torum shutting down_\n\n## The History of Torum\n\nLaunched in May 2017, Torum reportedly had more than 130,000 users, a substantial\nnumber for an underground forum. RaidForums, the most popular English-speaking forum,\nhas about 465,000 members, 15,000 active daily.\n\nTorum only gained popularity among the English-speaking audience in February 2019, when\nKickass (an English-speaking platform for cybercriminals) went offline. Torum’s user base\n[increased by 639% from February to October of that year.](https://www.digitalshadows.com/blog-and-research/forums-are-forever-part-1-cybercrime-never-dies/)\n\nWe used KELA’s DARKBEAST to dive into Torum’s posts, concluding it was actively\nmaintained throughout 2020, with almost 95,000 posts published from January to August.\nBased on our analysis, in addition to cybersecurity discussions, many conversations focused\non malicious activities and other related information, as well as trading and sharing accesses\nand databases.\n\n_Torum’s activity in 2020 (number of messages)_\n\nThe official reason for closure, provided by Torum’s administrator, is that he “lost the passion”\nto maintain the forum. We found nothing indicating otherwise. Torum was known for frequent\noutages: members mentioned the site could be down for a few days at a time, suggesting the\n\n\n-----\n\nadministrator wasn t rushing to fix technical issues. Some users also said the administrator\nwas tired of the flood of spam messages on Torum.\n\n_A message posted on Onion Links, a Telegram channel dedicated to darknet news: “In particular, the_\n_closure of the site is associated with constant spam, which was barely sorted out by the moderators. Both_\n_Dread and Envoy faced the same problem, which is why registration was suspended at the first one.”_\n\n## Was Torum Unique?\n\nAccording to users’ complaints on other forums, Torum featured many beginners asking\n**“noob questions” and scammers posting malicious links. When discussing Torum**\nshutting down, some mentioned it wasn’t such a loss. Others still paid respect to the forum:\n“Torum had it all – wacky stuff, DNM related content, discussion on fraud, scripting, hacking,\ncracking, and of course shitposts. For many, it was the community that introduced them to\nthe concepts of NetSec and fraud.”\n\n\n-----\n\n_Users discussing the closure of Torum (source: darknet forum TheHub)_\n\n_A user discussing the closure of Torum on (source: Dread, “the darknet Reddit”)_\n\n**It appears that Torum had loyal members, who rarely posted on other underground**\n**forums, at least with the same user handles. Torum’s ten most active users used 2-3**\nother forums on average, with Torum as their primary platform.\n\n**So what types of data were sold on Torum, and what interested its members? Here’s a**\nquick review of the topics discussed in July 2020:\n\n\n-----\n\n## Hacking and Cybersecurity\n\nUsers often asked for advice from experienced users, and the forum was considered a place\nwhere one could learn hacking. Here are a few recent examples of such questions: “What\ncan I do with IP address?”, “Have CC [credit card data] + info – now what?”, “Is it possible to\nget into someone’s iPhone camera and spy on them?” Torum claimed to be a place for indepth discussions about cybersecurity, but these conversations were much less common.\nHowever, some users referred to Torum members as experienced hackers. Besides hacking,\ncommunity members discussed general interest topics, such as Covid-19.\n\n_Discussions about darknet websites (source: Dread)_\n\n## Databases for Sale and Free\n\nTorum users shared popular recent leaks (Tokopedia breach and BlueLeaks, for example),\nas well as exclusive findings. For instance, one user posted data stolen from an Irish\nfinancial company, and others pointed out the company’s site has an XSS vulnerability.\nUsers shared databases in the forum’s Intel exchange section, open for members who\nposted ten messages on Torum.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Database leaks on Torum (via DARKBEAST)_\n\n## Accounts, Remote Access and Credit Card Data for Sale\n\nVarious users were looking to buy and sell remote access to organizations, accounts of\nfinancial services (including WebMoney, Exmo, PayPal, Yandex Money), and other types of\ndata. Based on their offering, we assume sellers didn’t use Torum as an exclusive trading\nplatform.\n\n## Malware for Sale\n\nThanos ransomware, which emerged in late 2019, attracted the attention of Torum users\ndebating whether the author of a post advertising it should be trusted. He identified as the\ndeveloper of Thanos, who decided to offer it to Torum’s users. Exploits, RATs, ATM malware,\nand other malicious tools were also discussed and offered for sale.\n\n_The developer of Thanos ransomware offered his product on Torum (via DARKBEAST)_\n\n\n-----\n\nAs can be seen, the data offered on Torum were rarely unique. However, users valued it as a\nplace for hacking-related conversations and learning. Torum had a private section for\nadministrators and moderators of the forum, but it was closed following leaks of private\ndiscussions. Now, both veterans and newbies must find a new platform for similar\ndiscussions.\n\n## Where Will Users Migrate?\n\nMost users have been probably already using other platforms and markets dedicated to\nleaks, malware, tools, etc. Torum was never famous for being the first source for such\n**offers, so users will look for a new place to discuss hacking activities. Here are the**\n**leading alternatives:**\n\nAccording to darknet chatter, a prospective replacement is CryptBB, which recently [eased](https://www.digitalshadows.com/blog-and-research/cryptbb-demystifying-the-illusion-of-the-private-forum/)\nthe acceptance process of new users. CryptBB, launched in 2017, started as a private\nEnglish-speaking hacking forum known for its rigorous application policy, only accepting\nmembers who pass an interview. However, in late 2019, CryptBB opened a section for\n“newbies” who are not skilled enough to be accepted but still want to learn from experienced\nhackers, posting a thread on Dread, where administrators invite beginners to improve their\nskills and evolve into “pro” members.\n\nCryptBB has around 10,000 users, but when users struggle to find forums with a decent\ncommunity, the application process and the semi-private mode might attract new users. Even\non Torum, members were looking for platforms with a strict screening process, including\nExodus, an exclusive forum that was closed in 2017.\n\n_A user interested in an alternative to Exodus (source: Torum; via DARKBEAST)_\n\nAs CryptBB seems focused on gaining a larger audience and building a new brand on the\ndarknet, Torum’s closure is a positive development. Some users are already recommending\nCryptBB as a replacement.\n\n\n-----\n\n_A thread on HiddenAnswers, the darknet alternative of Quora_\n\nCryptBB’s contenders include TheHub, claiming to have around 157,000 users, who are\nsupposedly less into hacking activities and not as active as Torum’s users. We traced about\n16,000 messages posted in 2020 – while Torum had almost 95,000.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Users discussing an alternative to Torum (source: TheHub)_\n\n_A now-deleted thread discussing Torum (source: TheHub; via DARKBEAST)_\n\nEven before Torum shut down, some users mentioned alternative darknet forums: Dread,\n**Nulled, Cracked,** **Helium, HackTown, HackForums, Envoy, and some Russian-speaking**\nforums.\n\n**While Torum and its alternatives are not where critical leaks are posted every day, they**\n**are a valuable source, revealing relationships between prominent hackers who share**\n**information about new TTPs. This data could be even more useful than the results of the**\nhacking activities (e.g., leaks) as it can help prevent attacks.\n\n\n-----",
