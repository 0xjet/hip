A large number of\nwebsites were compromised and used to\nhost malicious documents.\n\n###### Trickbot & business networks\n\nNorth American financial institutions were\ntargeted by the re-emergence of Trickbot early\nin the year. The resumption of Trickbot campaigns\nhighlighted an increased focus on business\ntargets specifically victims with broader access\nto network resources.\n\n###### Magecart form-jacking variants\n\nNew research uncovered as many as 38 different\nJS-sniffer variants, up from the 12 previously\nidentified. An estimated 1.5M victims had visited\ninfected webstores as JS-sniffers entered the\nCrime-as-a-Service market.\n\n\n###### GrandGrab highly visible\n\n\nThreat actors quickly updated the ransomware\nGrandGrab to V5.2 following the release of a\ndecryption tool by the No More Ransom Project.\nHowever, developers subsequently announced\nthe retirement of GrandGrab as they preferred\nalternatives to carry out more targeted attacks.\n\n###### Bank of Valetta malware attack \n\n\nBOV was the victim of a malware attack that caused\nsome disruption and losses estimated at EUR13M.\nAffected accounts were from the US, Czech\nRepublic and Hong Kong. The group involved also\nconducted a series of attacks against Scandinavian\ntargets but no losses were reported.\n\n###### New Lazarus APT campaign\n\nThe North Korean APT group, Lazarus, was detected\nin a new spear phishing campaign. Information\nrelating to victims’ current job position was\nrequested in a spoofed head-hunting/recruitment\nprocess, while systems were simultaneously\ninfected in the background.\n\n###### Percentage of all social media logins that were fraudulent in H1 2019.\n\nSource: Arkose\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Ramnit – global banking trojan\n\nThe US was at the top of the list of 10 most\ninfected countries with Italy and Japan second\nand third with about half the US infection rate\neach. Other countries in the top 10 such as\nthe UK, Canada, Germany and the Netherlands\nhad significantly lower rates of infection.\n\n###### Monetization of cybercrime\n\nCybercriminals worked hard during H1 2019\nto drive up revenues using sophisticated\npackage mule online infrastructure including\nstate-of-the-art HR and tracking systems.\n\n###### E-commerce sites targeted\n\n\nOnline shopping sites were specifically targeted\nby cybercriminals who exploited compromised\ncredentials in elaborate schemes to complete\nthe checkout process. “Package mules” were\nrecruited to send on stolen goods to specific\naddresses.\n\n\n###### New mobile malware surfaced\n\nImplemented in Java, TomcatBanker was a new\nAndroid banking trojan that appeared in 2019.\nCSIS believed it was written by a fairly skilled\ndeveloper to attack popular social apps,\ncryptocurrency apps, and over 100 other\npopular apps.\n\n###### Smishing on the rise\n\n\nSmishing, the mobile version of phishing, was\non the rise during H1 2019 largely due to the fact\nthat we all carry cell phones and the SMS protocol\ndoes not have a spam filter, making it a prime\ntarget for attack.\n\n###### UK targeted by PayPal phish\n\nA PayPal phish, aimed primarily at victims in\nthe UK, showed middle-aged individuals in the\n45-59 age range to be the most frequent victims.\nA two-step process mimicked a PayPal login page\nand the second step tricked victims into giving\nup personal information.\n\n###### Percentage of financially\n motivated breaches during 2019.\n\nSource: Verizon DBIR 2019\n\n\n-----\n\n###### FINANCIAL\n\n Increase in mobile financial attacks H1 2019.\n### 107[% ][Source: Kaspersky]\n\n###### Malware attacks that targeted financial services H1 2019.\n### 25[% ][Source: IntSights]\n\n###### GLOBAL STATISTICS\n\n Increase in number of monthly malware samples in 2019 compared to 2018.\n\nSource: AV-test\n\n###### 10[% ]\n\n\n###### Cyberattacks that relied on social engineering in H1 2019.\n\nSource: Purplesec\n\n###### 98[% ]\n\n IR teams frustrated by the inability to share data in H1 2019.\n\nSource: SentinelOne\n\n###### 68[% ]\n\n DANISH ORGANISATIONS\n\n Danish Internet users that experienced an IT security issue in 2019.\n### 50[% ][Source: Statistics Denmark]\n\n###### (or DKK 7,800,000) DKK 7,8 million\n\n Reported losses of Danish Organisations to social engineering in Q1 2019.\n\nSource: Finance Denmark\n\n\n-----\n\n###### GLOBAL COMPANIES\n\n\n###### Companies that reported Email-based spoofing of business partners in H1 2019.\n\n# 88[%][ Source: Mimecast]\n\n###### Companies that experienced an increase in supply chain attacks in H1 2019.\n\nSource: Symantec ISTR 2019\n# 78[% ]\n\n###### Increase in company email fraud attacks in Q1 2019 compared to Q2 2018.\n\nSource: Proofpoint\n# 80[% ]\n\n###### UK ORGANISATIONS\n\n\n###### Financial institutions that experienced a cybersecurity incident in the last 12 months.\n % Source: Clearswift\n\n### 70\n\n###### UK businesses reported having cybersecurity breaches in the last 12 months.\n\nSource: gov.uk\n\n### 32[% ]\n\n###### UK manufacturers that have been the victim of cybercrime in H1 2019.\n\nSource: Make UK\n\n### 60[% ]\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CSIS Threat Matrix H1 2019\n\n 01 Executive summary\n\n 02  Contents\n\n 03 Foreword\n\n 04  Real world scenarios\n\n A severe ransomware attack crippled a hosting company\n and forced them to negotiate with the threat actors.\n\n 05 Trends\n\n The malicious infrastructure associated with the Emotet malware still dominated\n the threat landscape along with banking malware such as Trickbot and ransomware Ryuk. In addition, form-jacking attacks on e-commerce sites undertaken by Magecart threat actors increased in H1 along with targeted ransomware attacks.\n\n 06 Malware\n\n The banking trojan Ramnit posed a significant and sustained\n threat to users in both North America, Europe and Japan.\n\n 07 CSIS statistics\n\n Secure DNS, CSIS Incident Response Kit and Phishing.\n\n 08 News from the phish pond\n\n PayPal continued to be a popular target for phishing attacks\n and a CSIS monitored a resilient campaign with a UK focus.\n\n 09 News from CSIS\n\n New services, products and features, plus upcoming developments.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### E-commerce sites are increasingly targeted by cybercriminals who are reaching new levels of sophistication and monetization\n by working together.\n\n October 2019\n\n\n###### 2019 got off to a brisk start with online\n fraud prevention presenting a whole series\n of new challenges to companies in the business of keeping your critical data safe.\n\nIt was notable that major online vendors such\nas Amazon and eBay increasingly drew the\nattention of fraudsters who used compromised\ncredentials in elaborate scams to complete the\ncash out process. Schemes involving “package\nmule networks” showed a whole new level of\nsophistication as they involved a complete\nHR-type hiring process to select the best\ncandidates to forward on stolen goods.\n\nAdditionally, attacks on the supply chain were\nup with a significant increase on previous numbers.\nAll of this indicates that threat actors are casting\ntheir nets far and wide to target unsuspecting\nor vulnerable organizations.\n\nFinancial institutions remained prone to attacks\nfrom bad actors, particularly targeting smartphones,\nas mobile financial attacks showed a marked\nupswing in H1 2019. Overall, mobile devices were\nbecoming a preferred attack vector for bad actors\ndue to the prevalence of cell phones and the\nlack of a spam filter for the SMS protocol.\n\nIt was yet again apparent that the best line of\ndefence against attack was to have well-trained\nand knowledgeable staff who were acutely\naware of the dangers of cybercrime.\n\n\nThe simple act of opening an unsafe document\nor clicking on a malicious link was a present\ndanger with most of cyberattacks still relying\non social engineering.\n\nAlthough CSIS always advises against negotiating\nwith cybercriminals, the consequences of\na ransomware attack on an organization could\nbe devastating, even to the extent of driving\nthe victim company out of business. Where\ncompanies feel they have no option but to\nnegotiate with perpetrators, we always stand\nby to offer our assistance to make sure our\ncustomers get back up and running as quickly\nas possible without opening themselves up\nto even more serious dangers.\n\nI hope you enjoy our latest report and it gives\nyou some valuable insights into the current\nstate of cybersecurity and the nature of today’s\nincreasingly sophisticated online security threats.\n\nAs always, thank you for supporting CSIS\nas we continue to partner with you to battle\ncybercrime wherever and whenever it\nbecomes a threat.\n\n###### PETER KRUSE\nHead of Research & Intelligence\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Extortion and customer service\n A targeted ransomware attack by sophisticated threat actors\n\n Problem:\n The CEO of a medium-sized hosting This was not just some company: “We have always been thinking random ransomware cybersecurity by design.

Unfortunately, the backup\nservers were also running as virtual machines\nand had, therefore, also been encrypted.\n\n###### The ransomware notes\n were priced at $25,000\n for each decryption tool.\n\nAs the conclusion of the results from Track 1\nbecame clear, there was only one option left,\nif the company wanted to get back online:\n“get the private encryption keys from the\ncybercriminals”, which in the ransomware notes\nwere priced at $25,000 for each decryption tool.\nThe threat actors had been using six different\nencryption keys but not all of them were related\nto business-critical equipment. In fact, just two\nof them would bring 99% of all the systems\nback online.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Extortion and customer service (continued)\n\n**_Screenshots from chat_**\n_Support chat between the Cybercriminals_\n_and the CEO of the compromised company._\n\n###### Solution:\n\nCSIS always strongly advises against\nnegotiation with cybercriminals. Despite\nour advice, the CEO of the infected company\ndecided to negotiate on his own. As he said,\n“The alternative could be bankruptcy”.\n\nIn short, the company succeeded in buying\nthe decryption tools from the cybercriminals\nwithout any assistance from CSIS. However,\nCSIS assisted afterwards in analysing the\ndecryption tools for backdoors before being\nused. The decryption tools were “clean”\nand worked as expected.\n\n\n###### CSIS always strongly\n advises against negotiation with cybercriminals.\n Despite our advice,\n the CEO of the infected\n company decided to negotiate on his own.\n As he said, “The alternative could be bankruptcy”.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Negotiation:\n\nThe negotiation was not without challenges\naccording to the CEO. Their adversaries tried\ndifferent techniques to put pressure on him.\nThey also tried to increase the price several\ntimes and did not deliver what was\nagreed upon.\n\n###### The negotiation was\n not without challenges\n according to the CEO.\n Their adversaries tried different techniques to\n put pressure on him.\n\n\n###### CSIS assisted afterwards\n in analysing the decryption tools for backdoors before being used.\n\nHowever, once the CEO made the point\nthat they were not to be trusted and did not\nkeep their word, the criminals backed off.\nTheir business model appeared to be based\non victims paying the ransom and having the\nconfidence that they would be able to recover\ntheir data. If it became known that the criminals\nwould not decrypt the data nobody would\npay the ransom, so no income.\n\n_(see screenshots on previous page)._\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Banking malware\n\n Threat actors expanded the Crime-as-a-Service business model \n\n The highly active Emotet botnet was a dominant malware threat in H1 2019. It had already scaled up\n its activities during 2018 and continuously flooded inboxes with daily spam campaigns.\n\n\n###### The distribution network was comprised\n of two major botnets known as “Epoch1”\n and “Epoch2”. The approach consisted\n of compromising a large number of\n websites which were used to host malicious documents. Subsequently, a direct link\n to the files were added to the spam\n emails. If the recipient clicked the link,\n the document with the payload\n downloaded to the victim’s machine.\n\n The dangers of Emotet infection\n\nThe dangers of an Emotet infection were\nmany. Because of the modular nature of the\nmalware, it was very effective in helping threat\nactors fingerprint the victim. After establishing\npersistence by creating scheduled tasks, the\nmalware was capable of stealing login credentials\nfrom all major browsers and email clients.\nAdditionally, an Outlook scraper tool was used\nto obtain contact information from the victim’s\nOutlook account. This could be used to spam\nmalicious emails to trusted contacts.\n\n###### A network spreading attack\n\nEmotet also deployed a network spreading\nattack from the infected machine by use\nof both stolen credentials and predefined\nbrute force lists.\n\n\n###### The dangers of an Emotet infection were many.\n Because of the modular nature of the malware, it was very effective in helping threat actors fingerprint\n the victim.\n\nOnce the infection was complete, Emotet would\npush additional payloads which consisted of\nboth banking trojans (in particular Trickbot)\nand ransomware such as Ryuk. Surprisingly,\nthe entire Emotet infrastructure went completely\nsilent in the first week of June – although\nsome dark forum chatter suggested that\na resurgence was planned for H2.\n\n###### Trickbot campaigns\n\n\nTrickbot campaigns resumed early in the year\nto pre-2019 levels with a focus on North American\nfinancial institutions such as TD Bank, Scotia Bank,\nDeloitte Canada and RBC. The malware itself\nhad a slight update to the password stealing\nmodule (pwgrab).\n\n\n-----\n\n###### The widespread Emotet C&C infrastructure:\n\n**_The Emotet C&C infrastructure_** Source: CSIS\n_Location of active servers during H1 2019._\n\n\n###### A wider range of exploitation\n\n\nTrickbot now looked specifically for credentials\non the infected machine related to the remote\naccess services VNC, PuTTY, and RDP. This\nhighlighted the increased focus on business\ntargets and in particular victims with broader\naccess to network resources.\n\nClearly, Trickbot threat actors were looking\nfor a wider range of exploitation opportunities\nthan just compromising a particular bank account.\nThis was further supported by the deployment\nof the hacking tool Mimikatz. Other active\ncampaigns included Danabot which targeted\nItalian, Polish and Australian users, various\nGozi v2 (Dreambot) variants in the US, Germany\nand Japan and QakBot distributed by the\nEmotet botnet mainly in the US.\n\n\n###### Hosted on Google Docs sites\n\n\nAlongside Trickbot, Gozi/Ursnif v3 was often\nactively distributed. One campaign attempted\nto lure the victims by suggesting that they\nhad been subpoenaed to appear in court.\nThe downloaded malicious documents were\nhosted on Google Docs sites which was\na clever way to get around security solutions.\n\nJust like Emotet and Trickbot, QakBot would\nattempt to spread across network-shared\ndrives by stealing or brute-forcing credentials\nFinally, Ramnit played a significant role actively\nclaiming victims particularly in the US and Italy.\n\n_Please find more details in the “Malware”_\n_section below._\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Magecart\n Double-digit number of Magecart groups ramped up attacks\n\n Magecart form-jacking attacks still\n posed a significant problem and new research from Group-IB indicated\n as many as 38 different JS-sniffer\n variants were involved compared\n to the 12 previously identified.\n\n\n###### Extensive campaign\n\n\nAn estimated 1.5 million people had visited\ninfected web store sites. JS-sniffers were also\nfound to have entered the Crime-as-a-Service\nmarket being sold or rented out for anywhere\nbetween $250 and $5,000. In May, TrendMicro\nreported an extensive campaign which affected\n201 campus online stores in the US and Canada.\nThe incident contained a supply chain element\nsince the threat actors compromised a shared\ne-commerce platform known as PrismWeb.\n\n\n###### PrismWeb’s payment form\n\n\nThe targeted nature of the attack - the malicious\nscript collected data only from HTML elements\nwith the specific IDs on PrismWeb’s payment\nform - was an unusual component that\nprompted TrendMicro to give this group\na separate name “Mirrorthief”.\n\n**_Screenshot showing the_**\n**_malicious JavaScript_**\n_The Magecart domain_\n_“jqueryextd[.]at” being_\n_blocked by CSIS Secure_\n_DNS- thereby preventing_\n_the fraudulent payment_\n_form from appearing_\n_in the browser._\n\n\n**_Screenshot showing the_**\n**_malicious JavaScript_**\n_The Magecart domain_\n_“jqueryextd[.]at” being_\n_blocked by CSIS Secure_\n_DNS- thereby preventing_\n_the fraudulent payment_\n_form from appearing_\n_in the browser._\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Number of formjacking attacks every month:\n\n Decreasing the risk\n of formjacking\n\nMake use of a third-party payment service\nsuch as PayPal to avoid entering any credit\n\n## 4800 card information on e-commerce sites\n\n###### Compromised websites per month\n\nAverage number of websites compromised Make sure you have an updated DNS\nwith formjacking code each month. protection solution installed such as\n\nSource: Symantec ISTR 2019 CSIS Secure DNS or Heimdal.\n\n###### Reports came out related to the compromise\n of Forbes magazine subscription site, followed by\n Picreel, an analytics provider, and CloudCMS,\n an enterprise-grade content management system.\n\n A combo phish’n’skim attack\n\n\nEven in cases where sites were not processing\nany payments but using a payment service\nprovider, a combo phish’n’skim attack was\ndocumented by Malwarebytes.

Although a decryption\n tool was released by the No More Ransom Project\n for version 5.1, threat actors quickly updated\n the malware to version 5.2.\n\n\n###### However, later in the year GandGrab developers announced retirement\n of the malware and instead other\n variants such as Ryuk, MegaCortex\n and LockerGoga gained traction\n by deploying more targeted\n strategies.\n\n Losses in excess of NOK 300M\n\nOne major incident involved Norwegian\naluminium manufacturer Norsk Hydro\nwhich was severely impacted by\nLockerGoga. Several other industrial\nand manufacturing companies had\nbeen targeted by the same malware.\nAn estimate from Norsk Hydro pointed\nto losses in excess of NOK 300M (£26M).\n\n###### $1.1m in ransom to regain access\n\nPublic entities also experienced severe\nproblems with ransomware, especially\nin the US where counties Riviera Beach\nand Lake City in Florida were compelled\nto pay a total of $1.1m in ransom to\nregain access to critical systems.\n\n\n###### US had the highest percentage\n\nEmail security provider Mimecast reported\nthat the US had the highest percentage\nof reported ransomware-caused business\nimpacts at 61%, with the UK showing\nthe lowest percentage at 39%.\n\n###### One major incident\n involved Norwegian aluminium manufacturer Norsk Hydro which\n was severely impacted\n by LockerGoga.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### APT - Advanced Persistent Threat\n Several groups remained active with both monetary and more sinister motives\n\n In February, BOV (Bank of Valetta) on\n Malta was hit by a malware attack which caused some disruption of services.\n\n\n###### It included a number of fraudulent transactions valued at EUR13M to\n accounts in the US, the Czech Republic\n and Hong Kong. According to CSIS\n sources, the group involved was\n “Empire Monkey”.\n\n Operation ShadowHammer\n\n\nLater in the year, the same group\nconducted a series of campaigns against\nScandinavian targets by impersonating\nthe financial authorities. No losses were\nconfirmed from the attack. In the last week\nof March, Motherboard reported a new\nsupply chain attack under the name\nof Operation ShadowHammer.\n\n###### Later in the year, the same group conducted a series of campaigns against Scandinavian targets by impersonating the\n financial authorities.\n\n\n###### The target was ASUS\n\n\nThe target was the hardware manufacturer\nASUS and their Live Update Utility. The ASUS\nupdate servers were compromised and started\nserving a malicious update to a targeted\nsubset of users.\n\n###### The ASUS update servers were compromised\n and started serving\n a malicious update to\n a targeted subset of users.\n\n APT group “BARIUM”\n\n\nAccording to investigations by Kaspersky\nit would have affected users between\nJune and November of 2018 and attribution\npoints towards APT group “BARIUM”.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### APT - Advanced Persistent Threat (continued)\n\n A significant security incident affected Wipro  the 3rd largest IT outsourcing firm in India.\n The story broke from well-known security journalist\n Brian Krebs who reported that the intruders\n compromised more than 100 Wipro systems\n and installed ScreenConnect on each of them,\n a legitimate remote access tool.\n\n Hacked Wipro systems\n\n\nInvestigators believed the intruders were\nusing the ScreenConnect software on the\nhacked Wipro systems to connect remotely\nto Wipro client systems which were then\nused to leverage further access into Wipro\ncustomer networks.\n\n###### Investigators believed\n the intruders were using the ScreenConnect software on the hacked\n Wipro systems to\n connect remotely to\n Wipro client systems.\n\n\n###### The FIN7 group\n continued activities in\n a campaign specifically targeted at Point of Sale\n (PoS) businesses.\n\n Carbanak sourcecode leaked\n\nThe FIN7 group continued activities\nin a campaign specifically targeted at Point\nof Sale (PoS) businesses using a malicious\nJavaScript activated through a macro-enabled\ndocument attachment. FIN7 had also been\nassociated with the sophisticated piece of\nbackdoor software known as Carbanak and\nin April the source code for the Carbanak\nmalware was found leaked on VirusTotal\nby FireEye researchers.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Not much substantive news regarding\n the malware itself was found but a major concern was not so much what the\n security community could learn from\n this, rather what other threat actors\n might learn and use for their own\n purposes in future attacks.\n\n\n###### The infamous ZeuS/Zbot\n\n\nThis pattern has been well documented\nsince the public release of the infamous\nZeuS/Zbot source code and several\nsimilar incidents.\n\n###### The North Korean APT\n group known as Lazarus\n was detected in a new\n spear phishing campaign with an attachment named\n \"Euronet_Application.rar\".\n\n\n###### North Korean APT group\n\n\nFinally, the North Korean APT group known\nas Lazarus was detected in a new spear\nphishing campaign with an attachment\nnamed \"Euronet_Application.rar\".\nWhen opened, a pop-up would request\ninformation related to the victim’s current\njob position which could have seemed\nconsistent with a head-hunting/recruitment\nprocess. However, in the background,\na digitally signed dropper would be installed\non the system allowing access for the\nthreat actors.\n\n###### A second stage payload\n\nCSIS suspected that the initial information\ngathering could be used for segmentation\nof the victims in order to more effectively\ndecide on a second stage payload.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Ramnit malware version 2.0\n\n An effective banking trojan with updated stealth capability\n\n\n###### Ramnit V.2.0 changes\n\nCSIS had been monitoring the latest\nversion 2.0 of the banking trojan Ramnit\nsince around mid-2018. A few noteworthy\nchanges were detected when compared\nto the original version:\n\n###### • Protocol “hello” request\n changed from 0x00ff to 0x895e.\n\n • Used a plugin called “Camellia”.\n\n • Had injects in LUA format.\n\n • Created task in TaskSheduler\n for persistence.\n\n • Supported both 32-bit and\n 64-bit platforms”.\n\n • AV circumvention via PowerShell\n script which used standard Windows\n API functions to create a unique\n executable file with the body encrypted.\n\n**_Screenshot of Ramnit code_**\n_Binary file encryption._\n\n\n###### Biometric patterns defeated\n\nOriginally, Ramnit 2.0 even had a built-in\nfeature which suspended all threads related\nto RapportGP.dll in order to circumvent\nIBM Trusteer Rapport. However, in the latest\nsamples analysed, that feature was removed.\nAnother module was deployed to defeat\nthe biometric patterns recorded by security\nvendor BioCatch, making Ramnit one\nof the more sophisticated threats of 2019.\n\nAt the time of writing, CSIS observed three\ndifferent botnets - with 40, 100 and 600\ndomains associated respectively –\nall top-level domain .eu.

However,\nanother large part of cybercrime revolved\naround exploiting compromised credentials\nfor e-commerce sites such as Amazon and\neBay. In these cases, an elaborate setup\nwas necessary to complete the cash out\nprocess.\n\n###### Another large part\n of cybercrime revolved\n around exploiting compromised credentials\n for e-commerce sites such\n as Amazon and eBay.\n\n\n###### The threat actors\n needed to order goods\n from the victim’s account, send the package in an anonymous way and\n finally resell the goods\n to retrieve money.\n\n Bypassing retail anti-fraud detection\n\nThe threat actors needed to order goods\nfrom the victim’s account, send the package\nin an anonymous way and finally resell the\ngoods to retrieve money. Handling the\npackage traffic posed different challenges\nfrom bypassing retail anti-fraud detection\nand necessitated finding trustworthy money\nmules who did not keep the packages for\nthemselves. During 2019, CSIS managed\nto monitor Cash-out as a Service markets\nused by different fraud operators.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### SMS spambot messages - Package mule network:\n\n**_Screenshot from SMS spambot_**\n_Package mules receiving conformation._\n\n###### To build a network of package mules,\n the operator of the cash-out operation started by recruiting the “employees”.\n For that they used SMS spambots\n to send out job advertisements\n to different countries.\n\n Finding trustworthy money mules\n\n\nDear Applicant, you have been approved\nfor the position, find details here: eu-hu[.]com.\nThe link in the SMS redirect the victim to\nan online recruitment process.\n\n\n###### CSIS managed to monitor Cash-out as a Service markets used by different fraud operators.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### The monetisation of compromised data (continued)\n\n To handle the job applicants,\n the cash-out services operator hired\n Human Resources staff to be in charge\n of calling all applicants and rating\n the suitability of the candidates.\n\n Package mules - Online recruitment process:\n\n**_Screenshot from online recruitment process_**\n_The job applicants recieved an SMS with a link_\n_redirecting the victim to an online recruitment proces._\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Cash-out services operators - Job applicants tool:\n\n Package mule - Web panel menu:\n\n\n**_Service operator tool_**\n**_screenshot_**\n\n_Human resources staff_\n_hired by the cash-out_\n_service operators were_\n_in chargeof calling_\n_all applicants and_\n_rating their suitability._\n_When a new package_\n_mule had been approved,_\n_the main threat actors_\n_would give them access_\n_to a web panel._\n\n**_Packaging mule_**\n**_web panel screenshot_**\n\n_All the upcoming package_\n_numbers were listed along_\n_with the location where_\n_they would have to send_\n_the related packages._\n_Everything had been_\n_automated and logged._\n\n\n-----\n\n###### The monetisation of compromised data (continued)\n\n All kinds of goods were shipped around\n the world, ranging from gold bars to\n high tech components, by what would\n appear to be a legitimate firm.\n\n Package mule network\n\n\n###### Human resources\n\n\n###### Infrastucture Workers\n Managers Packages\n operators\n mules\n\n\n###### Payroll managers\n\n\n###### A specialised network\n\n\nThis type of specialised network supported\nevery kind of fraud related to e-commerce\nsites such as Amazon or eBay. A botmaster\ncould steal Amazon credentials, order goods\nfrom the account and then send them to\na pool of package mules in the relevant\ncountries.\n\n\n###### The cash-out service \n\n\nThe cash-out service managed everything\nfrom the package transport to the reselling\nof the goods. Every day, the cash-out\nmanager maintained a list of goods that\nwere easy to resell and the botmasters\nonly had to order the right ones.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Package mule network:\n\n The botmaster could ultimately expect between\n 15 to 50% of the price of any delivered packages\n with a success rate between 80 to 90%.\n\n**_Screenshot from internal communication between threat actors_**\n_This conversation relates to a specific_\n_graphics card or iPhone._\n\n\n-----\n\n###### The monetisation of compromised data (continued)\n\n Cash-out service workflow\n\n $ Illigal market $ $\n\n\n**Scams**\n\n**Phishing**\n\n**Malware**\n\n**Breaches**\n\n\n**Cash-out firm**\n**& Package drop**\n\n**(Mules)**\n\n\n**e-commerce**\n**credentials**\n\n**(Orders)**\n\n\n###### Since the anti-fraud mechanisms of online banking\n have become more advanced and e-commerce\n sites like Amazon have become part of the daily\n life of most people, the carders began to depend\n on scalable cash-out operations like this one\n to continue to increase their revenue. \n\n Specialisation and segmentation\n\n\nThis kind of specialisation and segmentation\nof the business is also preferred because it\nundermines law enforcement investigations;\nbehind one carder you would find different\nmoney mule networks and illegal marketplaces\nbased on different country-specific legislation.\nProving that a smartphone in a marketplace\ncame from a specific stolen Amazon account\nwas next to impossible.\n\n\n###### Behind one carder you\n would find different money mule networks and illegal marketplaces based on different country-specific legislation.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### TomcatBanker\n\n A new Android banking trojan coded in Java\n\n A completely new Android banking trojan surfaced\n early this year and CSIS have been trying to map\n out any information about its infection campaigns.\n The malware was implemented in Java and its\n samples could be found in large volumes on\n the popular threat hunting platforms.\n\n Used overlays to attack\n\n\nReverse engineering the trojan's binaries led to\nthe belief that it was written by a fairly skilled\ndeveloper. TomcatBanker primarily used overlays\nto attack popular social apps, cryptocurrency\napps, as well as over a hundred financial apps from\nthe following countries: Austria, Australia, France,\nGermany, Italy, Turkey, The United Kingdom\nand The United States.\n\n###### Riltok aka Realtalk\n\n Yet another overlay-based banking trojan\n\n In January of 2019, CSIS noticed an odd campaign of a certain banking malware\n for the Android OS. Riltok (aka Realtalk) turned out to be an overlay-based banking trojan and a lot of its code was implemented\n in a native library instead of Java.\n\n Clearly targeting France\n\n\nThe incidence we observed was clearly targeting\nFrance with its fake Leboncoin website campaign\nwhich delivered the malware to a victim’s\nsmartphone via a phishing attack.\n\n\n###### Reverse engineering the trojan's binaries led to the belief that it was written by\n a fairly skilled developer.\n\n Russian bank customers\n\n\nHowever, during our analysis, only configuration\nfor the attacks against customers of Russian\nbanks came up. The original Leboncoin website\nis a French portal for selling used and secondhand goods. A year ago, we saw Realtalk attack\nAndroid devices in the UK. It was running an\nalmost identical campaign as infections came\nthrough a fake Gumtree website which\nis a similar UK website to Leboncoin.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Gustuff\n\n Mobile malware as-a-service\n\n Gustuff is a variant of AndyBot. The victim’s banking account was compromised by displaying HTML based overlays, which\n had simple credential-phishing\n functionality with two steps (for AU,\n USA and the EU countries).\n\n Anubis\n\n\n###### Only ten slots for renting\n\n\nThe seller of the malware opened only\nten slots for renting the Gustuff kit\npriced at $800/month. CSIS did not\ndetect any activity of the botnet\nfrom May 2019.\n\n\n###### Well-known malware variant still going strong\n\n H1 2019 was eventful for Anubis – one of the most\n common Android banking Trojans since 2017. 2018 ended with the release of version 2.5 which brought plenty of feature updates, such as an ability to associate the Anubis infection with the same victim’s Windows PC infection.\n\n\n###### This became possible when a victim\n of a Windows PC infection connected\n their uninfected Android device to\n their PC via USB.\n\n Anubis source code leaked\n\n\nIn March 2019, the author of Anubis\n(aka Maza-In) was arrested in The Russian\nFederation. Two men were accused of the\ndevelopment, the operation and the sale\nof the Trojan. The following month, someone\nleaked the source code of the Anubis\nmalware and its infrastructure. Naturally,\nthis leak increased the interest of the blackhat\ncommunity in this Trojan. Soon developers\nstarted working on variants of Anubis.\n\n\n###### Android Accessibility Services \n\nThe most notable variant development\nthat came to the attention of CSIS on\nthe underground forums, was about adding\na capability of abusing the Accessibility\nServices of the Android OS in order to\nmanipulate financial apps and transfer\n(steal) funds automatically. Besides Anubis,\nthere was another code leak this year that\nis worth mentioning. A banking trojan\ncalled Asacub was leaked to the public\nin May 2019. CSIS had not yet confirmed\nany variants in the wild.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Google Play\n Official app stores were not immune to malicious code\n\n At CSIS we had been paying\n close attention to the Google Play\n app store throughout 2019.\n\n**_Google Play app store_**\n**_screenshot_**\n_Examples of innocent_\n_looking but malicious_\n_apps._\n\n###### Analysing suspicious apps\n\n\nWe had been analysing some of the suspicious\napps and have reported up to 50 apps during\nH1 2019 and almost all of them were subsequently\ntaken down by Google. The reported apps'\nmalicious functionality usually included adware,\nspyware or loader capabilities.\n\n\n###### The reported apps'\n malicious functionality usually included adware, spyware or loader capabilities.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Malware timeline\n 2010-2019\n\nJan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec\n\nBugat (Feodo) Gootkit Dozer VBMania Gozi v2\n\nStuxnet Kenzero\n\n**2010**\n\nCarberp.A Nimkey Murofet/Licat\n\nRamnit **LEAK of Gozi code**\n\nCycbot OddJob Anti-Spyware 2011 ZeroAccess PonyLoader (Fareit) Tilon\n\nSpyEye Citadel\n\n**2011**\n\nShylock Duqu Shiz\n\nTatanga **LEAK of ZeuS code** Ice IX GOZeuS\n\nFlame BlackPOS Alina Dexter\n\n**2012** Reveton Tinba Shamoon Red October Skynet\n\nNecurs\n\nZeusAESCridex KINS Hesper CryptoLocker NeverQuest CriLock\n\nStardust Zeus SSL 64bit Zeus (Tor)\n\n**2013**\n\nAdwind PowerZeus **LEAK of Carberp code** Upatre\nHavex **LEAK of PonyLoader code**\n\nPonyLoader 2.0 CryptoWall3 CTBlocker Carbanak\n\nZeusVM Retefe Equation Poshcoder TorrentLocker BlackEnergy 3 Punkey Carberp.C\n\n**2014**\n\nNewPOSthing JackPOS Dyreza Dridex FindPOS\n\nBlackPOS v2 Emotet **LEAK of Tinba code**\n\nPoSeidon VaultCrypt Encryptor RaaS Cryptowall4\n\nTeslaCrypt CryptoFortress Corebot Android.LockerPIN Ransom32\n\n**2015**\n\nTox Hidden Tear Linux.Encoder.1\n\nShifu Teslacrypt 2 Radamant\n\nLocky Petya PandaZeus Zepto HDDCryptor\n\nCerber GozNym Stampado **LEAK of Mirai code**\n\n**2016**\n\nSamas-Samsam FastPOS CryLocker ScanPOS\n\nJigsaw Trickbot\n\nEmotet v4 Globeimposter Scarab\n\nNotPetya ShadowPad Terdot\n\n**2017**\n\nJaff BadRabbit\nWannaCry IcedID\n\nGandCrab Backswap VPNFilter\nDanabot RedEye\n\n**2018**\n\nMnuBot Ruyk\n\nMagecart Leak of TreasureHunter code\n\nMegaCortex TajMahal\n\nGlitchPOS **LEAK of Carbanak code**\n\n**2019**\n\n**LEAK of Anubis code**\n\nSodin/REvil\n\nBanking Trojan Worm, Loader APT threat POS malware Ransomware Important event\n\n\n-----\n\n###### The story behind the numbers\n CSIS Anti-Fraud Feed System and CIRK statistics\n\n The DNS protection solution offered by CSIS,\n and supported by on-going threat intelligence research, blocked millions of customer requests to domains associated with malware, phishing and other\n online threats. \n\n Top 10 categories - blocked by CSIS Secure DNS\n\nConfirmed Malware\n\nC&C Server\n\nPhishing\n\nScam/Spam\n\nTypo squatting\n\nSuspected Malware\n\nAdware\n\nMobile Malware\n\nDrive-by exploits\n\nSinkhole\n\nPCT 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40\n\n###### CSIS Secure DNS\n\n\nThe detection underlined the continued\nneed for an additional layer of mitigation\nsince the malware developers could easily\ntest if they would be detected by anti-virus\nproducts but had no way to get around\na DNS filter that intercepted the network\ncommunication after a successful infection.\n\n\n###### The detection underlined\n the continued need\n for an additional layer\n of mitigation.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Top 5 malware detections by CIRK H1 2019:\n\n\n7%\n\n\n3%\n\n\n**VARIANT** **PCT.**\n\n\n**51%**\n\n**25%**\n\n**16%**\n\n**7%**\n\n**1%**\n\n\n15%\n\n26%\n\n###### Ursnif is the dominant malware\n\n\n49%\n\n\n**Gozi/Ursnif/Dreambot**\n\n**Trickbot**\n\n**Emotet**\n\n**Dridex**\n\n**Wannacry**\n\n###### Regular phishing attacks\n\n\nA significant change from our previous\nThreat Matrix Report was we found Ursnif\nto have replaced Trickbot by a substantial\nmargin as the dominant malware variant\ndetected.
