This](https://www.intezer.com//new-variants-of-agent-btz-comrat-found/)\nsecond part in the series will demonstrate in greater detail exactly how we discovered these\nnew variants.\n\n**1. Methodology**\n\nTo begin, we used our hunting methodology, which consist of four main parts:\n\n**Collection: Collect multiple samples from different versions.**\n**Analysis: Mark functions that have stayed consistent across all versions that are**\nlikely to be a part of the next version.\n**Creating a signature: Create a robust yet flexible YARA rule for these functions.**\n**Hunting: Search a large repository of files with that YARA rule (VirusTotal, for**\nexample).\n\n\n-----\n\n**2. Why focus on Agent.BTZ?**\n\nWe chose to focus on Agent.BTZ for several reasons: First, This is one of the oldest\n**state-sponsored threat, developed and operated by the Turla group since (at least)**\n**2007 for dozens of targeted attacks.**\n\n**Second, there is also a lot of public knowledge regarding Agent.BTZ specifically and**\n**Turla group in general available online, including intel reports, technical analyses**\n**and malware samples, which we used for our research.**\n\n**Third is the fact that this specific malware has remained out of public view for the**\n**last two to three years; however, we recognized that it wasn’t likely to disappear–it**\n**has just continued to fly under the radar.**\n\n**3. Do the math**\n\nWe based our research on an earlier publication from three years ago: “Evolution of\nsophisticated spyware: from Agent.BTZ to ComRAT” by Paul Rascagnères of GDATA (at\nthe time). In this excellent blog post, Paul described the evolution of Agent.BTZ to ComRAT\nbetween 2007-2014 by manually diffing (BinDiff) two different candidates from each major\ninternal hard-coded version (referred by the authors as “Ch” or “PVer”).\n\nThe following table shows the code’s similarity between each version to its direct neighbors.\nBy summing up the data in this table we can conclude that, in general, about ~30% of the\noriginal code has been used in every version up to the latest known version as of 2014\n(marked in red).\n\n_** https://www.gdatasoftware.com/blog/2015/01/23927-evolution-of-sophisticated-spyware-from-agent-_\n_btz to comrat_\n\n\n-----\n\nObviously this 30% isn t comprised of totally unique code made by Agent.BTZ s developers;\nrather, it is a mixture made of mostly common code that can be found in many more\nsoftware products (both legit and malware). For example, these could include C Runtime\nLibrary or any other 3rd party library such as zlib. Using **[Intezer’s technology, we were](https://www.intezer.com//technology/)**\n**able to do a ‘deep dive’ into this code, automatically mapping all of the common,**\n**library and (most importantly) unique pieces of code created by the malware’s**\n**authors.**\n\n**4. Mysterious magic number**\n\nAfter filtering out all of the common and library code, we were left with several unique\nfunctions that can be found in every version of the malware since 2007. The most\nprominent is the following function:\n\nIn the picture you can see the two, almost identical functions from the first version (Ch 1.0)\non the right and the latest version (Ch 3.26) of Agent.BTZ on the left. This function is initially\nreading first four bytes of a given file, and then comparing them for the magic number\n0xAAFF1290 (marked in red). If it matches, the function will return true; otherwise, it is\nfalse.\n\n\n-----\n\nSo, what is this magic number? Which file is it? We were actually unable to find the function\nthat creates this file within the same binary (ver 3.26). The function shown above is the only\nreference to that magic number. Luckily, while re-reading old ThreatExpert’s Agent.BTZ\nanalysis from 2008 we happened to notice the following paragraph:\n\n_[http://blog.threatexpert.com/2008/11/agentbtz-threat-that-hit-pentagon.html](http://blog.threatexpert.com/2008/11/agentbtz-threat-that-hit-pentagon.html)_\n\nSo now we know that this function is used to verify thumb.dd files, which are log/config files\nleaked over newly-connected USB drives (to overcome air-gapped networks, like those of\nthe Pentagon). But wait… why didn’t we found the function which creates these files?\n**Because the USB-infection vector was removed few years earlier! And yet the**\n**adversary is still looking for these valuable thumb.dd files…**\n\n**5. Hunting for new variants**\n\nSo far, we know that this function exists, and it has stayed consistent across all versions of\nthe malware; we know what it does (verify certain magic number) and why (detect thumb.dd\nfiles leaked from internal network by older versions of the malware). By that information, we\ncan tell that it’s likely to be used in future versions as well.\n\nThe next step involves writing a dedicated YARA rule(see appendix) for that specific\nfunction and searching for new samples. The rule has to be tolerant to minor changes\nbetween versions (mainly due to different compilation flags). Using the VirusTotal\nIntelligence service, we were able to scan about 2-3 months’ worth of file uploads. As soon\nas the scan finished, we dug into the results and discovered this first new variant of\n**Agent.BTZ that wasn’t yet mentioned in any public report:**\n\n\n-----\n\n**A screenshot from the [Intezer Analyze™ product displaying partial code connections](https://www.intezer.com//intezer-analyze/)\nbetween new sample to old samples of Agent.BTZ(Turla group).\n\nThis [specific file was supposedly compiled at 2016-07-13 (the timestamp was modified in](https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/6ad78f069c3619d0d18eef8281219679f538cfe0c1b6d40b244beb359762cf96/analysis/)\nsome of the earlier samples) and uploaded to VT 2017-05-11, which means that this sample\nis at least two years newer than any previous sample.\n\n6.
