Among the affected regions are Germany, France,\nSpain, the Philippines, and the Netherlands, with the most victims being located in the US.\n\nThe ransomware was given the name “BlackCat” due to the favicon of a black cat being used on\nevery victim's Tor payment site. The operators of BlackCat have been using the names “alphv”\nand “ransom” in Cybercrime forums (ramp_v2, exploit.in) in order to recruit affiliates.\n\nThe operators of the ransomware appear to be from Russian speaking regions. Like many others,\nBlackCat uses a RaaS model (Ransomware-as-a-service). Affiliates of BlackCat are offered\nbetween 80-90% of the ransom payment, and once approved, are given access to a control panel\nthat manages access:\n\n_Leaked document from BlackCat Leaks website_\n\n[One of the unique elements of the BlackCat ransomware is that it is written in Rust, which is not a](https://www.rust-lang.org/)\ncommon coding language for malware and ransomware. “Rust is a multi-paradigm, general_purpose programming language designed for performance and safety.”_\n\nBecause of Rust’s emphasis on performance, the process of encryption is very fast, and in\naddition, Rust is cross-platform, which makes it easier to create variants for both Windows and\nLinux.\n\n\n-----\n\n[The operators of BlackCat confirmed that they are affiliates of](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/blackcat-alphv-ransomware-linked-to-blackmatter-darkside-gangs/) [DarkSide/BlackMatter ransomware](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/cybereason-vs-darkside-ransomware)\n[gang. They claim to be apolitical in regards to geopolitical relations and to refrain from attacking](https://therecord.media/an-alphv-blackcat-representative-discusses-the-groups-plans-for-a-ransomware-meta-universe/)\nmedical institutions and hospitals.\n\nThe group has adopted the popular double extortion paradigm, which means that in addition to\nencrypting files, they also steal them and later threaten to publish stolen data unless the ransom is\npaid. In some cases even, triple extortion is used - threatening to perform DDOS attacks.\n\n## Key Details\n\n**Sophisticated Ransomware: BlackCat has been called “2021’s most sophisticated**\nransomware\n**High Severity: The** [Cybereason Nocturnus Team assesses the threat level as HIGH given](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/authors/cybereason-nocturnus)\nthe destructive potential of the attacks.\n**Developed in Rust: BlackCat was developed in rust which is unusual for ransomware.**\n**Triple Extortion: The BlackCat operators used double extortion and sometimes triple**\nextortion to make victims pay the ransom\n**Shared Infrastructure with LockBit: BlackCat has shared infrastructure, and used similar**\ntools and naming conventions as the LockBit ransomware.\n**Detected and Prevented:** [The Cybereason XDR Platform fully detects and prevents the](https://www.cybereason.com/platform)\nLorenz ransomware.\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\n### Breaking down BlackCat Ransomware\n\nThe BlackCat ransomware has both Windows and Linux variants. The ransomware includes\nmultiple execution flags which grant its operators control over operations like whether to stop\nexecutions of virtual machines or if the ransomware should change the desktop wallpaper or not:\n\n\n-----\n\n_BlackCat help menu_\n\nIn order to execute properly, BlackCat must be executed with the “--access-token” flag, although\nthe value of the string that is passed on to it can be any string.\n\nUpon execution, BlackCat may attempt to perform Privilege escalation in the following manners:\n\nUAC bypass by abusing the Connection Manager Admin API Helper for Setup COM\ninterface (cmstplua.dll)\n[Abusing CVE-2016-0099 (Secondary Logon Service exploit)](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0099)\nAdjusting access token token privileges\n\nNext, BlackCat checks the UUID (universally unique identifier) of the machine by running a WMI\ncommand, which is used later for the recovery URL in the ransom note:\n\n_wmic csproduct get UUID_\n\n[BlackCat enables local and remote symbolic links on the infected machine. A symbolic link is a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link)\ntype of file that contains a reference to another file. This is probably done to make sure that the\nransomware is able to follow shortcuts on the machine in order to find the original file to encrypt:\n\n_fsutil behavior set SymlinkEvaluation R2L:1_\n\n_fsutil behavior set SymlinkEvaluation R2R:1_\n\nBlackCat also attempts to stop Internet services on the infected machine using the iisreset.exe:\n\n_iisreset.exe /stop_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe ransomware changes the number of outstanding requests that can be maintained. An\noutstanding request is a request that is still waiting for a response. These are used when\nperforming SMB requests, the change is probably done to raise the number of possible PsExec\nrequests the machine could make so the ransomware may spread:\n\n_reg add_\n_HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\LanmanServer\\Parameters_\n_/v MaxMpxCt /d 65535 /t REG_DWORD /f_\n\nThen, it deletes the shadow copies from the infected machine using both “vssadmin” and “wmic”:\n\n_vssadmin.exe delete shadows /all /quiet_\n\nwmic shaodwcopy delete\n\n_BlackCat Execution as seen in the Cybereason XDR Platform_\n\nBlackCat enumerates all local disk partitions on the infected machine, and any hidden partition\nthat is found is mounted in order to make it possible to encrypt more files.\n\nThe ransomware also attempts to propagate through the network via the use of the “net use”\ncommand and PsExec which is embedded inside the BlackCat executable. The ransomware\nexecutes the tools using credentials that are configured in the ransomware config:\n\n_Credentials in the configuration_\n\nAdditionally, BlackCat disables windows’ automatic repair and clears the machine's event log, by\nrunning the following commands:\n\n_bcdedit /set {default} recoveryenabled No_\n\n_cmd.exe /c for /F \\\"tokens=*\\\" %1 in ('wevtutil.exe el') DO wevtutil.exe cl \\\"%1\\\"_\n\n\n-----\n\nIn order to maximize the number of encrypted files, BlackCat attempts to kill several processes\nand services on the machine in order to decrease the number of locked files that are not\naccessible due to another program (full list in appendix). In addition, BlackCat’s configuration\nincludes a list of directories to be excluded from encryption. (see appendix):\n\n_BlackCat Configuration_\n\nTo encrypt the files, BlackCat may use AES or ChaCha20 for encryption, based on the\nconfiguration. It drops a ransom note titled : “RECOVER-[encrypted file extension]- FILES.txt” in\neach folder and in the end, the ransomware changes the desktops wallpaper:\n\n_Wallpaper after BlackCat change_\n\n\n-----\n\n_BlackCat ransom note_\n\n**Linux variant specific commands**\n\nThe Linux variant was observed executing commands in order to delete VMware ESXi snapshots.\nThe ransomware generates a list of running virtual machines:\n\n_esxcli --formatter=csv --format-param=fields==\"WorldID,DisplayName\" vm process list_\n\nEach virtual machine is then terminates using the command:\n\n_awk -F \"\\\"*,\\\"*\" '{system(\"esxcli vm process kill --type=force --world-id=\"$1)}'_\n\nFinally all snapshots of the virtual machines are deleted:\n\n_for i in `vim-cmd vmsvc/getallvms| awk '{print$1}'`;do vim-cmd vmsvc/snapshot.removeall $i_\n_& done_\n\n## BlackCat and LockBit Connection\n\nThe Nocturnus team observed interesting overlaps between tools and infrastructure used by\nBlackCat ransomware and LockBit ransomware. The Nocturnus team analyzed a .NET written\nlauncher named “setup.exe” that is used to download and execute BlackCat ransomware.\n\nThe launcher contains the following PDB path:\n\n“D:\\my\\Documents\\Visual Studio 2019\\setup\\obj\\Release\\setup.pdb”.\n\nWhen searching for files that share the PDB, we encountered several additional malware with the\nsame name that have remarkable similarities to the BlackCat launcher. When examining the code\nand Infrastructure of these malware, we see overlaps between BlackCat infrastructure and LockBit\ninfrastructure.\n\n**BlackCat Launcher**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe launcher downloads the BlackCat executable from the C2 and executes it using the -access-token” argument, which is required in order to run BlackCat:\n\n_BlackCat Launcher code_\n\nAdditionally, the tool collects basic profiling information about the infected machine and uploads it\nto the C2. The information collected is:\n\nA screen capture\nUsername\nOS name\nOS language\nTimezone\nWindows UUID\nKeyboard language\nInstalled users\nInstalled software\nDrives\n\n**LockBit Profiler Tool**\n\nThe Nocturnus team discovered striking similarities with the BlackCat launcher and a profiler\nassociated with LockBit ransomware. The profiler variants which are linked to LockBit use almost\nthe same code as the BlackCat launcher, except for slight variations.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe only difference in functionality is that they do not attempt to download anything, they only\ncollect profiling data, with the difference being that instead of collecting the machine’s “Windows\nUUID”, the profiler checks if LockBit is already installed on the machine:\n\n_Left: LockBit profiler code Right: BlackCat Launcher code_\n\nWhen checking the Infrastructure used by these tools, we see connections and similarities in the\nIP addresses, URI structure, and file names:\n\n\n-----\n\n_BlackCat and LockBot infrastructure comparison_\n\nAll the IP addresses that are used by the BlackCat launcher and LockBit profiler, share the URI\npaths “files” and “upload”. In addition, BlackCat and LockBit samples sometimes share file\nnames. For example, we observed BlackCat samples with the name:\n\n“test_4mmc_x86_32_windows_encrypt_app.exe” and LockBit samples with the name\n“4mmc.exe”\n\nAnother example of shared file names is a LockBit sample named “screensaver.exe”, which is\nalso the default name used for the BlackCat executable that is downloaded using the launcher:\n\n_“Screensaver.exe” used in BlackCat Launcher_\n\nThis connection between some of the tools and infrastructure between BlackCat ransomware and\nLockBit ransomware might indicate sharing of code and tools between cybercriminals, or there\ncould be individuals that worked for both ransomware operators:\n\n\n-----\n\n_BlackCat and LockBit Infrastructure map_\n\n## CYBEREASON DETECTION AND PREVENTION\n\nThe Cybereason XDR Platform is able to prevent the execution of the BlackCat Ransomware\nusing multi-layer protection that detects and blocks malware with threat intelligence, machine\nlearning, and next-gen antivirus (NGAV) capabilities.\n\nAdditionally, when the Anti-Ransomware feature is enabled, behavioral detection techniques in the\nplatform are able to detect and prevent any attempt to encrypt files and generates a MalOp for it:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Cybereason Detects and Blocks BlackCat Ransomware_\n\n## SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n**Enable the Anti-Ransomware Feature on Cybereason NGAV: Set Cybereason Anti-**\nRansomware protection mode to Prevent - more information for Cybereason customers can\nbe found here\n**Enable Anti-Malware Feature on Cybereason NGAV: Set Cybereason Anti-Malware mode**\nto Prevent and set the detection mode to Moderate and above - more information for\nCybereason customers can be found here\n**Keep Systems Fully Patched: Make sure your systems are patched in order to mitigate**\nvulnerabilities\n**Regularly Backup Files to a Remote Server: Restoring your files from a backup is the**\nfastest way to regain access to your data\n**Use Security Solutions: Protect your environment using organizational firewalls, proxies,**\nweb filtering, and mail filtering\n\n## MITRE ATT&CK BREAKDOWN\n\n\n**Reconnaissance** **Execution** **Privilege**\n**Escalation**\n\n\n**Discovery** **Lateral**\n**Movement**\n\n\n**Collection** **Impact**\n\n\nGather Victim\nHost Information\n\n## Appendix\n\n**Process to kill list:**\n\n\nCommandline\ninterface\n\n\nSigned\n[Binary Proxy](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1218/)\nExecution\n\nAccess\nToken\nManipulation\n\nExploitation\n[for Privilege](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1068/)\nEscalation\n\n\nProcess\nDiscovery\n\nSystem\n[Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1007/)\nDiscovery\n\nFile and\n[Directory](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1083/)\nDiscovery\n\n\nLateral\nTool\nTransfer\n\n\nData from\n[Local](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1005/)\nSystem\n\n\nData\n[Encrypted](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1486/)\nfor Impact\n\nService\nStop\n\nInhibit\n[System](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1490/)\nRecovery\n\n\n-----\n\nagntsvc, dbeng50, dbsnmp, encsvc, excel, firefox, infopath, isqlplussvc, msaccess, mspub,\nmydesktopqos, mydesktopservice, notepad, ocautoupds, ocomm, ocssd, onenote, oracle,\noutlook, powerpnt, sqbcoreservice, sql, steam, synctime, tbirdconfig, thebat, thunderbird,\nvisio, winword, wordpad, xfssvccon, *sql*, bedbh, vxmon, benetns, bengien, pvlsvr,\nbeserver, raw_agent_svc, vsnapvss, CagService, QBIDPService, QBDBMgrN,\nQBCFMonitorService, SAP, TeamViewer_Service, TeamViewer, tv_w32, tv_x64, CVMountd,\ncvd, cvfwd, CVODS, saphostexec, saposcol, sapstartsrv, avagent, avscc, DellSystemDetect,\nEnterpriseClient, VeeamNFSSvc, VeeamTransportSvc, VeeamDeploymentSvc\n\n**Services to kill list:**\n\nmepocs, memtas, veeam, svc$, backup, sql, vss, msexchange, sql$, mysql, mysql$,\nsophos, MSExchange, MSExchange$, WSBExchange, PDVFSService,\nBackupExecVSSProvider, BackupExecAgentAccelerator, BackupExecAgentBrowser,\nBackupExecDiveciMediaService, BackupExecJobEngine, BackupExecManagementService,\nBackupExecRPCService, GxBlr, GxVss, GxClMgrS, GxCVD, GxCIMgr, GXMMM,\nGxVssHWProv, GxFWD, SAPService, SAP, SAP$, SAPD$, SAPHostControl, SAPHostExec,\nQBCFMonitorService, QBDBMgrN, QBIDPService, AcronisAgent, VeeamNFSSvc,\nVeeamDeploymentService, VeeamTransportSvc, MVArmor, MVarmor64, VSNAPVSS,\nAcrSch2Svc\n\n## About the Researchers\n\nTom Fakterman\n\nTom Fakterman, Cyber Security Analyst with the Cybereason Nocturnus Research Team,\nspecializes in protecting critical networks and incident response.
