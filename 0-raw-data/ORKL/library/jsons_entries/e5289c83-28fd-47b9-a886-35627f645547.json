    "plain_text": "# APT41: A Case Sudy\n\n**intrusiontruth.wordpress.com/2022/07/20/apt41/**\n\nintrusiontruth July 20, 2022\n\nAs you know, we have been dedicated for some time now to revealing the truth behind statesponsored, managed or directed intrusion sets. We have learnt more about the way in which\nthe Chinese state conduct their criminal cyber activity and how it has evolved over the years.\n\nChinese APT groups are aggressive, persistent, and garner a large network of criminal\nhackers. The Chinese state uses this model to promote their agenda and provide protection\nto the common cybercriminal. This model is fallible which allows us to promote the truth\nbehind these intrusion sets.\n\nNevertheless, the CCP continue to outwardly lie to protect their international and domestic\nreputation. They do this whilst simultaneously supporting cybercrime and allowing huge\nnetworks to profit from its illegal activities. The Chinese state is asserting do what I say, not\nwhat I do.\n\n## APT41: What we know\n\n\n-----\n\nAPT41 is a difficult group to pin down/classify/group. It is a group with many names:\nWICKED PANDA/DOUBLE DRAGON/WICKED SPIDER/WINNTI GROUP, the list appears to\ngo on.\n\nEarly intrusions by APT41 traditionally focussed on the international gaming sector, reusing\nstolen code-signing certificates for malware distribution. Indicted APT41 actors registered\ngaming domains which later went on to serve as a means to fraudulently obtain gaming\n[currency (through the Malaysian company SEA Gamer) and establish backdoors into](https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/southeast-asia/article/3101937/malaysias-sea-gamer-mall-confirms-two-top-staff-members)\ninternational gaming companies to facilitate the spread of Chinese intrusions.\n\nTheir focus on the gaming industry became a tangible lead against the group, with a heavy\nfocus in countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand. Timing as always is crucial.\nThis early APT41 activity focused on the gaming industry at a time when the Chinese state\nwas mandating growth in the gaming sector.\n\nOver the past few years, APT41 has evolved. No longer is the focus purely on the gaming\nindustry. Rather we have seen evidence of APT41 creating front companies in the computer\nand technology sector, claiming to employ pen testers and software developers which all\n\n\n-----\n\nsupports the MSS model we have come to know well. It serves their aim of continuing to use\nhighly aggressive techniques to support China’s ambitious development targets alongside\nState Security Departments.\n\nAs [FireEye neatly evidence, APT41 juggle their commitments to the Chinese state in the day](https://www.mandiant.com/sites/default/files/2022-02/rt-apt41-dual-operation.pdf)\n(using the 9-9-6 model [9am-9pm, 6 days a week]) whilst hacking for financial gain in the\nevening. In some cases, using state-level malware across both activity streams.\n\nAPT41 stands out due to its prolific use of non-public malware outside of working hours.\nThey also share this malware with other cyber hackers in China, who work to various\nregional State Security Departments.\n\n## China’s state priorities and subsequent APT41 victims\n\n\n-----\n\nThe culmination of APT41 s targets point to clear tasking from the Chinese state rather than\na criminal entity. It serves to highlight the state’s backing of groups such as APT41 and the\ndegree of coordination behind the scenes.\n\nFor example, APT41’s exfiltration of intelligence from vaccine development and healthcare\ninstitutes in order to advance the CCP’s knowledge and gain an illegal, competitive edge.\nAPT41 have taken advantage of the Coronavirus pandemic by hacking COVID-19 research\nand stealing IP in order to fast-track the Chinese-state’s somewhat questionable vaccine\nsupply.\n\nSome readers will have noted APT41’s vast victims in the indictment. One of interest to us\nwas NGO16: A non-profit organisation dedicated to alleviating worldwide poverty. APT41\ncompromised this organisation and put the livelihood of fellow humans at risk. It is\nincreasingly clear the morals of the criminals behind this group are non-existent.\n\nChinese APTs don’t simply target international companies. They also target their own\ncitizens using malware from big data capture to allow direct oversight of text message logs of\nhigh-profile Chinese targets. APT41 have systematically targeted hotels prior to senior\nofficials staying in order to retrieve personal and identifiable information. This sort of direct,\ntimely and specific targeting adds to the body of evidence that the Chinese state outsource\nat least part of their intrusive surveillance program to criminals within its borders.\n\nIt appears US indictments are not having the same effect as they used to. Back in February,\n[Mandiant reported on APT41 re-comprising US government victims, and using niche animal](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/apt41-us-state-governments)\nhealthcare apps such as USAHERDS to gain access to intelligence to serve the CCP data\nmachine.\n\nDespite five of the actors being doxed by the US in 2020, APT41 TTPs have continued to be\npop up on our radar. Their interest recently? Universities.\n\n## Recent Targeting\n\nAnd not just any universities. Universities in locations the CCP are concerned about: Taiwan\nand Hong Kong.\n\n[As already noted in the OSINT community, RouterGod is a known, custom malware tool](https://metmox.com/old-threats-new-faces-threat-hunting-made-easy-with-metmox/)\nused by Wicked Panda (APT41). We have observed sustained connections to RouterGod\ncommand-and-control servers from multiple IP addresses associated with Hong Kong\nuniversities, including the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and Education\nUniversities\n\nAs recently as March 2022, APT41 were using a VPS at Romania-registered IP address\n91.238.50.114 to host “watson.misecure.com”. We have seen evidence that they used this\ndomain to compromise National Taiwan University databases using the “xp_cmdshell”\n\n\n-----\n\n(T1059.003) tool (to execute commands for netstat, process list, and network configuration)\nand successfully exfiltrated personally identifiable data on staff, students, and alumni of the\nuniversity.\n\nIt appears nothing is off limits to this group. Any and all data is up for grabs.\n\n## Summary\n\nWe know the CCP uses criminal hackers to do their dirty work. Due to their lack of skill at\nevading detection, we also have the names of five individuals linked to Chinese intrusion set\nAPT41.\n\nThe contractor model is no longer a neatly packaged, self-contained concept. The\ncontinuation of APTs engaging in dual hatting despite this now being public knowledge\nspeaks to the Chinese state turning a blind eye. Repeated for-profit hacking makes it highly\nunlikely that APT41 is operating without the state’s awareness. And despite being named\nand shamed in public indictments, this still does not deter the group’s continued hacking of\nCCP’s targets – most recently we have reported on this occurring in the Education sector,\nwith students, staff and alumni falling victim and their sensitive data stolen to feed the CCP\ndata machine.\n\nAPT groups appeal because they are aggressive, dispensable and ‘distanced’ from the\nstate-run organisations that sit behind them. We will continue to shed light on these cracks\nwithin the system; it is only a matter of time before this model becomes untenable. There is a\nlot of good work going on in this field (e.g, the Hearing on China’s Cyber Capabilities in the\nUS) but we need to do more and keep applying the pressure. This is not just a US problem.\n\nThe rest of this series will look into who the APT41 indicted actors are. How are they\nconnected and how does this fit into the complex web that is APT41? Stay tuned…\n\n\n-----",
