DEBUG TESTS\n\n-h  Show this message\n\n```\nWhen running the ransomware with the ' -w ' argument, the Linux encryptor will shut down\nall running VMware ESXi virtual machines using the following esxcli command:\n```\nesxcli --formatter=csv --format-param=fields==\"WorldID,DisplayName\" vm process list\n| tail -n +2 | awk -F $',' '{system(\"esxcli vm process kill --type=force --worldid=\" $1)}'\n\n\n```\n[When encrypting files, the ransomware utilizes the NTRUEncrypt public-key encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTRUEncrypt)\nalgorithm, which support various 'Parameter Sets' that offer different levels of security.\n\n\n-----\n\nAn interesting feature of RedAlert/N13V is the -x command-line option that performs\n'asymmetric cryptography performance testing' using these different NTRUEncrypt\nparameter sets. However, it is unclear if there is a way to force a particular parameter set\nwhen encrypting and/or if the ransomware will select a more efficient one.\n\n[The only other ransomware operation known to use this encryption algorithm is FiveHands.](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/analysis-reports/ar21-126a)\n\n**NTRUEncrypt encryption speed test**\n_Source: BleepingComputer_\nWhen encrypting files, the ransomware will only target files associated with VMware ESXi\nvirtual machines, including log files, swap files, virtual disks, and memory files, as listed\nbelow.\n```\n.log\n\n.vmdk\n\n.vmem\n\n.vswp\n\n.vmsn\n\n```\nIn the sample analyzed by BleepingComputer, the ransomware would encrypt these file\ntypes and append the .crypt[number] extension to the file names of encrypted files.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Encrypting files in Linux with RedAlert**\n\n_Source: BleepingComputer_\nIn each folder, the ransomware will also create a custom ransom note named\n**HOW_TO_RESTORE, which contains a description of the stolen data and a link to a unique**\nTOR ransom payment site for the victim.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Red Alert / N13V ransom note**\n\n_Source: BleepingComputer_\nThe Tor payment site is similar to other ransomware operation sites as it displays the\nransom demand and provides a way to negotiate with the threat actors.\n\nHowever, RedAlert/N13V only accepts the Monero cryptocurrency for payment, which is not\ncommonly sold in USA crypto exchanges because it is a privacy coin.\n\n\n-----\n\n**RedAlert / N13V Tor negotiation site**\n\n_Source: BleepingComputer_\nWhile only a Linux encryptor has been found, the payment site has hidden elements\nshowing that Windows decryptors also exist.\n\n## \"Board of Shame\"\n\nLike almost all new enterprise-targeting ransomware operations, RedAlert conducts doubleextortion attacks, which is when data is stolen, and then ransomware is deployed to encrypt\ndevices.\n\nThis tactic provides two extortion methods, allowing the threat actors to not only demand\nransom to receive a decryptor but also demand one to prevent the leaking of stolen data.\n\nWhen a victim does not pay a ransom demand, the RedAlert gang publishes stolen data on\ntheir data leak site that anyone can download.\n\n\n-----\n\n**RedAlert / N13V Data Leak Site**\n\n_Source: BleepingComputer_\nCurrently, the RedAlert data leak site only contains the data for one organization, indicating\nthat the operation is very new.\n\nWhile there has not been a lot of activity with the new N13V/RedAlert ransomware\noperation, it is one that we will definitely need to keep an eye on due to its advanced\nfunctionality and immediate support for both Linux and Windows.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Microsoft Azure now has confidential VMs with ephemeral storage](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-azure-now-has-confidential-vms-with-ephemeral-storage/)\n\n[New ‘Cheers’ Linux ransomware targets VMware ESXi servers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-cheers-linux-ransomware-targets-vmware-esxi-servers/)\n\n[Linux version of Black Basta ransomware targets VMware ESXi servers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/linux-version-of-black-basta-ransomware-targets-vmware-esxi-servers/)\n\n[New Windows Subsystem for Linux malware steals browser auth cookies](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-windows-subsystem-for-linux-malware-steals-browser-auth-cookies/)\n\n[Malicious PyPI package opens backdoors on Windows, Linux, and Macs](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/malicious-pypi-package-opens-backdoors-on-windows-linux-and-macs/)\n\n[Linux](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/linux/)\n[N13V](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/n13v/)\n[RedAlert](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/redalert/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Virtual Machine](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/virtual-machine/)\n[Vmware ESXi](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/vmware-esxi/)\n[Windows](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/windows/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
