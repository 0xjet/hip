    "plain_text": "# No pandas, just people: The current state of China’s cybercrime underground\n\n**[intel471.com/blog/china-cybercrime-undergrond-deepmix-tea-horse-road-great-firewall](https://intel471.com/blog/china-cybercrime-undergrond-deepmix-tea-horse-road-great-firewall/)**\n\nChina's internet is a lot different than the rest of the world. Yet, that hasn't stopped its\npopulation from engaging in cybercrime.\n\nDespite the various measures the Chinese government has taken to censor and surveil its\nresidents on the internet, a significant cybercrime underground full of financially motivated\nactors exists. Efforts like \"The Great Firewall\" or government crackdowns on content related\nto cybercrime force actors to put in remarkable effort to maneuver around those roadblocks\nin order to access, create or participate in criminal marketplaces that mirror those more\ncommonly known to the rest of the world.\n\nData from Intel 471 show that the Chinese cybercrime underground proliferates through use\nof common methods or platforms, but behaves differently in large part due to the caution\nthat actors take with regard to their identity. While the average citizen must follow the heavy\nhanded nature of the government's surveillance of cyberspace, Chinese threat actors take\nspecial precautions to protect their forums, TTPs and themselves. This leads to the Chinese\ncybercrime underground being disorderly when compared to others, particularly Russia,\nwhich tend to be much more organized.\n\n## Where is the Underground?\n\nForums hosted on the Tor network have barriers to entry for most Chinese users as the\ngovernment blocks Tor on the Chinese internet. In order for actors operating in mainland\nChina to access these services, they need a VPN or similar measure capable of evading\ngovernment detection. Guides and toolkits that allow a user to accomplish this task are often\navailable on the underground. However, if actors do break through — or are operating from\nother popular Chinese cybercriminal hubs like Hong Kong, Malaysia, Myanmar, The\nPhilippines, and Taiwan — there are a host of forums used by cybercriminals.\n\n### DeepMix Market\n\nDeepMix Market is one of the most well-known Chinese underground marketplaces, even\nafter disappearing for several weeks in 2019 after a sustained DDoS attack. It eventually\nresurfaced in December 2019, with enhanced protections for its users.\n\nThe marketplace's offerings are categorized into several sections, including \"datainformation,\" \"service-orders,\" virtual resources, physical goods, techniques and tutorials,\nand carding materials/CVVs, among others. It also uses heightened measures to ensure\nanonymity, such as discouraging users to post contact details, encouraging users to buy and\n\n\n-----\n\nsell things via the in-forum system, and forcing users to use small numeric handles to\nidentify accounts. Actors on DeepMix have used the same handles for long periods of time in\norder to build brand awareness, reflecting that reputation is still paramount even as identity\nis a highly sensitive subject.\n\n### United Chinese Escrow Market\n\nThe United Chinese Escrow Market, or UCEM, was established in June 2018 to sell goods\nand services like those on DeepMix, but differs in that users can set up their own\nindependent shops instead of relying on one central purchasing hub. Marketplace postings\nare listed in U.S. dollars, but bitcoin is the only accepted currency for transactions, with an\nexchange rate determined by a third-party payment service provider. The site also has\nfunctions similar to other ecommerce sites, including sections where users can discuss their\ntransaction experience, an internal mailbox function to communicate with other members, a\nbitcoin wallet management section.\n\n### Tea Horse Road\n\nEstablished in June 2019, Tea Horse Road is similar to UCEM and DeepMix in allowing for\ntrading different goods and services, but the site also includes a forum where users discuss or\nsell data, vulnerabilities or other virtual and physical goods. Earlier this year, Intel 471 saw a\nnumber of marketplace users spin up Telegram channels that were affiliated with the site,\nmade in order to provide an extra layer of security when discussing listings or other siterelated matters. These channels are very active, with users heavily engaged in discussions\nwhile being careful not to include information that might reveal account handles on the\nactual site.\n\n### Free City\n\nFree City is similar to Tea Horse Road, particularly due to use of Telegram channels. The\nmarketplace has seven sections for users: data and intel, services and order replacement,\nvirtual resources, physical goods, specialized products, CVV and carding, and private escrow\ntransactions. The Telegram channels allow users to discuss what's for sale in the forums,\nwhile also hosting tutorials and other information related to making purchases.\n\n### Open Web forums\n\nOpen web hacking forums where Chinese cybercriminals congregate do exist, but often get\nshut down by the Chinese government. There have been numerous initiatives launched under\nChinese President Xi Jinping that have led to the crackdown of what the government has\ndeemed to be illicit internet content. In April 2020, China's Ministry of Public Security\nannounced it punished 1,522 people for public security and notified other departments to\n\n\n-----\n\ngive 433 party and political sanctions for matters related to cybercrime. Some of the more\npopular open web forums, like HLODAY or HZDG (华中帝国, also known as China Central\nEmpire), have gone down during this time.\n\nMore often, skilled Chinese actors make their way to international forums, such as Exploit,\nHack Forums, Raid Forums and XSS. These actors advertise tools and services like any other\nmember: compromised payment cards, information or data, ransomware, cryptomining\nmalware and more.\n\n### Messaging Clients\n\nThe Telegram channels tied to Tor services is indicative of another trend: Chinese actors like\nto use messaging clients to converse with each other in the underground. This is partly due to\nthe familiarity of the greater Chinese population with messaging platforms like WeChat and\nQQ, which are extremely popular among Chinese internet users. However, those platforms\nfall under the same government restrictions as the rest of the country's internet. Therefore,\nwe have seen Chinese actors move to non-native messaging services like Telegram. Nonnative services decrease the likelihood of linking online personas to real offline identities, as\nwell as provide end-to-end encryption to ensure greater anonymity.\n\n## How are they accessing the underground?\n\nBecause of the anonymity and censorship circumvention needed to develop and sell malware\nor stolen data, Chinese actors have learned to be extremely adaptable. The Chinese\ngovernment's efforts to watch its population's internet activity means there is no anonymous\naccess, since an IP address can be tied to an actual person. This results in the anonymity of a\nChinese actor being \"thinner\" than in other areas of the world.\n\nIn order to evade detection, Chinese actors will change IP addresses by joining different WiFi\nnetworks and getting modems to request a new dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP)\naddresses, use the TOR network, leverage VPN and proxy services to bypass the Great\nFirewall, use codewords to avoid keyword filters, and tools such as shadowsocks relay (ssr)\nand V2Ray.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that some actors do manage to bypass the censorship measures and\naccess international sites and services means that although the latest tools and techniques\nare available to the Chinese underground, not everyone has access to them. This has led to a\ntrend of Chinese actors modifying source code of freeware and malware families to develop\ntheir own versions for use, distribution and sale, or using popular forums such as GitHub to\nrefine their skills, fine tune tools or access the latest malware.\n\n## What do they sell on the underground?\n\n\n-----\n\nBecause getting around the Great Firewall can be so difficult, a lot of the malware being\npushed on Chinese cybercriminal underground forums is built upon existing tools. Intel 471\nhas observed numerous Remote Access Trojans (RATs) that are variants of already known\nmalware or pentesting tools, such as:\n\nAnubis\nAsyncRAT\nCobalt Strike\nGh0st\nGray Pigeon\nGray Wolf\nNjRAT\nSpynote\n\nWe also observed popular tools such as worms, brute forcers, DDoS tools and postexploitation tools, as well as exploits for vulnerabilities in web servers for Apache, Oracle and\nMicrosoft Windows. There was also interest in software that mines cryptocurrencies while\nalso attempting to steal wallets or credentials to access online wallets. Additionally, both\ninternational (GandCrab, WannaCry) and domestic (FilesLocker) variants of ransomware\nwere placed on various forums.\n\nSpecific behavior that stood on these forums was: hacking of illegal gambling sites, QQ tools,\nblackhat search engine optimization services, spamming, scamming, and other actions that\nlead to ripping off other members of the cybercriminal underground.\n\n## What does the future hold?\n\nAs long as the Chinese government shows the ability and desire to crack down on its\npopulation's internet activity, highly-skilled actors will continue to closely guard their skills\nand identity in an effort to avoid being caught. Petty criminals and script kiddies may thrive\nwhile the proficient will continue to fly under the radar by avoiding public posts of highprofile breaches, access and or custom tools. With the censorship and surveillance practices\ncarried out by the Chinese government unlikely to stop, the variety of forums, as well as\ndifferent TTPs employed by actors, likely will continue to adapt and evolve in order to make\nas much money as possible.\n\nThe above information has been pulled from an Intel 471 whitepaper that has further indepth information on the Chinese cybercrime underground.
