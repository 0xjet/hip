In both instances, the malware relies on the sense of urgency created by tools\n\n\n-----\n\ndesigned to prevent fraud to encourage targets to use them. This malware can\nsteal authentication factors crucial to accessing accounts from their victims on the targeted\nfinancial institutions in Mexico.\n\nMcAfee Mobile Security is identifying this threat as Android/Banker.BT along\nwith its variants.\n\n## How does this malware spread?\n\nThe malware is distributed by a malicious phishing page that provides actual banking\nsecurity tips (copied from the original bank site) and recommends downloading the\nmalicious apps as a security tool or as an app to report out-of-service ATM. It’s very likely\nthat a smishing campaign is associated with this threat as part of the distribution method or\nit’s also possible that victims may be contacted directly by scam phone calls made by the\ncriminals, a common occurrence in Latin America. Fortunately, this threat has not been\nidentified on Google Play yet.\n\n## Here’s how to protect yourself\n\nDuring the pandemic, banks adopted new ways to interact with their clients. These rapid\nchanges meant customers were more willing to accept new procedures and to install new\napps as part of the ‘new normal’ to interact remotely. Seeing this, cybercriminals introduced new scams and phishing attacks that looked more credible than those in\nthe past leaving customers more susceptible.\n\n**Fortunately, McAfee Mobile Security is able to detect this new threat as**\n**Android/Banker.BT. To protect yourself from this and similar threats:**\n\nEmploy security software on your mobile devices\nThink twice before downloading and installing suspicious apps especially if they\nrequest SMS or Notification listener permissions.\nUse official app stores however never trust them blindly as malware may be distributed\non these stores too so check for permissions, read reviews and seek out developer\ninformation if available.\nUse token based second authentication factor apps (hardware or software) over SMS\nmessage authentication\n\nInterested in the details? Here’s a deep dive on this malware\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1- Phishing malware distribution site that provides\n\n\nsecurity tips\n\n\n-----\n\n## Behavior: Carefully guiding the victim to provide their credentials\n\nOnce the malicious app is installed and started, the first activity shows a message in Spanish\nthat explains the fake purpose of the app:\n\n– Fake Tool to report fraudulent movements that creates a sense of urgency:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2- Malicious app introduction that tries to lure users to provide their bank credentials\\\n“The ‘bank name has created a tool to allow you to block any suspicious movement. All\noperations listed on the app are still pending. If you fail to block the unrecognized\nmovements in less than 24 hours, then they will charge your account automatically.\n\nAt the end of the blocking process, you will receive an SMS message with the details of the\nblocked operations.”\n\n– In the case of the Fake ATM failure tool to request a new credit card under the pandemic\ncontext, there is a similar text that lures users into a false sense of security:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3- Malicious app introduction of ATM reporting variant that uses the Covid-19\npandemic as a pretext to lure users into providing their bank credentials\n“As a Covid-19 sanitary measure, this new option has been created. You will receive an ID\nvia SMS for your report and then you can request your new card at any branch or receive it\nat your registered home address for free. Alert! We will never request your sensitive data\nsuch as NIP or CVV.”This gives credibility to the app since it’s saying it will not ask for some\nsensitive data; however, it will ask for web banking credentials.\n\nIf the victims tap on “Ingresar” (“access”) then the banking trojan asks for SMS permissions\nand launch activity to enter the user id or account number and then the password. In the\nbackground, the password or ‘clave’ is transmitted to the criminal’s server without verifying if\nthe provided credentials are valid or being redirected to the original bank site as many others\nbanking trojan does.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4- snippet of user-entered password exfiltration\nFinally, a fixed fake list of transactions is displayed so the user can take the action of\nblocking them as part of the scam however at this point the crooks already have the victim’s\nlogin data and access to their device SMS messages so they are capable to steal the second\nauthentication factor.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5- Fake list of fraudulent transactions\nIn case of the fake tool app to request a new card, the app shows a message that says at the\nend “We have created this Covid-19 sanitary measure and we invite you to visit our antifraud tips where you will learn how to protect your account”.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6- Final view after the malware already obtained bank credentials reinforcing the\nconcept that this application is a tool created under the covid-19 context.\nIn the background the malware contacts the command-and-control server that is hosted in\nthe same domain used for distribution and it sends the user credentials and all users SMS\nmessages over HTTPS as query parameters (as part of the URL) which can lead to the\nsensitive data to be stored in web server logs and not only the final attacker\ndestination. Usually, malware of this type has poor handling of the stolen data, therefore, it’s\nnot surprising if this information is leaked or compromised by other criminal groups which\nmakes this type of threat even riskier for the victims. Actually, in figure 8 there is a partial\nscreenshot of an exposed page that contains the structure to display the stolen data.\n\nFigure 7 – Malicious method related to exfiltration of all SMS Messages from the victim’s\ndevice.\nTable Headers: Date, From, Body Message, User, Password, Id:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8 – Exposed\n\npage in the C2 that contains a table to display SMS messages captured from the infected\ndevices.\nThis mobile banker is interesting due it’s a scam developed from scratch that is not linked to\nwell-known and more powerful banking trojan frameworks that are commercialized in the\nblack market between cyber-criminals. This is clearly a local development that may evolve in\nthe future in a more serious threat since the decompiled code shows accessibility services\nclass is present but not implemented which leads to thinking that the malware authors are\ntrying to emulate the malicious behavior of more mature malware families. From the selfevasion perspective, the malware does not offer any technique to avoid analysis, detection,\nor decompiling that is signal it’s in an early stage of development.\n\n**IoC**\n\nSHA256:\n\n84df7daec93348f66608d6fe2ce262b7130520846da302240665b3b63b9464f9\nb946bc9647ccc3e5cfd88ab41887e58dc40850a6907df6bb81d18ef0cb340997\n3f773e93991c0a4dd3b8af17f653a62f167ebad218ad962b9a4780cb99b1b7e2\n1deedb90ff3756996f14ddf93800cd8c41a927c36ac15fcd186f8952ffd07ee0\n\n**Domains:**\n\nhttps[://]appmx2021.com\n\n[McAfee Labs Threat Research Team](https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/author/mcafee-labs/)\nMcAfee Labs is one of the leading sources for threat research, threat intelligence, and\ncybersecurity thought leadership.
