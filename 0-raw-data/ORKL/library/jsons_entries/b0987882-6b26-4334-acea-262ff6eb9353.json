Both Conti and Ryuk also appear to be\npart of the Wizard Spider cybercriminal group, and are responsible for the TrickBot botnet.\n\nNot only do on-chain investigations indicate funds for salary paid by a Conti core\nmember were derived from a known Ryuk ransomware address, similarities in code\nand other factors suggest that Conti is a rebranding of the Ryuk ransomware. Such a\ntactic of rebranding is widely known to be used by ransomware syndicates to cover\n[their tracks as described by BleepingComputer.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/conti-ransomware-shows-signs-of-being-ryuks-successor/)\n\n\n-----\n\nOn February 27, 2022, an individual with apparent inside access to Conti s\ninfrastructure leaked nearly 160,000 messages from internal chats and other data\nshedding light on more than a year of Conti’s operations, uncovering the syndicate’s\necosystem as well as hundreds of crypto addresses used to extort victims and fund the\ngroup's activities. Authentication of leaks as having come from Conti infrastructure was\n[confirmed by the threat intelligence community including TheRecord.](https://therecord.media/conti-ransomware-gang-chats-leaked-by-pro-ukraine-member/)\nThe leak was sparked by Conti’s official statement on February 25, 2022, announcing\nfull support to the Russian State and threatening the world with offensive operations if\nany Russian infrastructure is attacked as a possible response to Russia’s invasion of\nUkraine.\n\n### Background\n\nRyuk ransomware, which was active from mid-to-late 2018, was responsible for a high\nnumber of ransomware attacks resulting in millions of USD in losses. For several years, the\nthreat intelligence community has suspected that both Ryuk and Conti ransomware were\n[operated by a single group identified as Wizard Spider by CrowdStrike based on the](https://adversary.crowdstrike.com/en-US/adversary/wizard-spider/)\nsimilarities in code and other factors.\n\nAfter Ryuk’s suspected rebrand to Conti in approximately May of 2020, the ransomware\ncontinued becoming even more destructive, eventually merging with the group running the\n[TrickBot botnet at the end of 2021 according to threat intelligence firm AdvIntel. TrickBot](https://www.advintel.io/post/the-trickbot-saga-s-finale-has-aired-but-a-spinoff-is-already-in-the-works)\ninitially emerged in 2016 as a banking Trojan designed to steal user credentials and\npersonally identifiable information (PII). The prolific botnet then expanded its capabilities to\ncredential harvesting, crypto mining, and gaining a foothold into the victims’ systems to\ndeploy ransomware.\n\nTrickBot and Wizard Spider’s Ryuk business relationships first followed a BaaS (Botnet-as-aService) model and grew to a partnership after Ryuk’s rebranding to Conti. Working with\nTrickBot, Conti quickly became one of the most profitable and prolific ransomware\nsyndicates. Threat researcher Jack Cable, who runs the crowdsourcing ransomware site\n[ransomwhe.re, estimated Conti as being the most profitable group through mid-2021.](https://ransomwhe.re/)\n\n\n-----\n\n_Image Source: TRM Labs_\n\n### Conti Supports Russia, Issues Threats\n\nAccording to the chatter observed on top-tier dark-web forums, the Russian invasion of\nUkraine and the ongoing military conflict have split the Russian-speaking cybercriminal\ncommunity. In dark web chatter, many cybercriminals, including ransomware threat actors,\nvoiced support for a particular side, while others, like LockBit2.0, tried to maintain a level of\nneutrality. On February 25, 2022, Conti openly voiced its support for the Russian State and\nposted a threat to the “Western world” on its official extortion site, stating it would strike back\nwith offensive operations if any of the Russian infrastructures is attacked.\n\n_Source: Conti’s Extortion Site_\nShortly after Conti’s official statement, on February 27, 2022, an individual with apparent\ninside access to Conti’s infrastructure leaked purported internal chat logs consisting of nearly\n160,000 messages via Twitter, shedding light on more than a year of Conti’s operations. The\nindividual who leaked the chats claimed in online tweets to be doing so in retaliation for\nConti’s support of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The leak also included hundreds of\n\n\n-----\n\ncrypto addresses, which appear to have been used in the group s illicit activity to extort\nvictims and pay for services such as the salaries of the group’s members. Authentication of\nleaks as having come from Conti infrastructure was confirmed by the threat intelligence\n[community including TheRecord.](https://therecord.media/conti-ransomware-gang-chats-leaked-by-pro-ukraine-member/)\n\n### Connecting Wizard Spider, Conti, and Ryuk\n\nAn analysis of the Conti leaks, specifically information within the leaked messages related to\nsalary payments, as well as the on-chain flow of funds revealed unique insights into the\noperation of Wizard Spider. TRM analysts found that, unlike most ransomware syndicates,\nConti implements a model of wage-based employees in addition to the percentage-based\naffiliate model used by traditional RaaS (Ransomware-as-a-Service) groups.\n\nTRM on-chain analysis corroborated payments discussed on July 14, 2020; the chats show\nactors “Salamandra”, the threat actor in charge of Conti’s HR, and “Stern”, a senior Wizard\nSpider team member, discussing a potential candidate for hire, called \"bonen\". bonen, a\ncoder with 20 years of experience was hired with a salary of 150,000 Rubles per month\n(approximately $2,112 USD at the time). In addition, bonen was paid 15,000 Rubles\n(approximately $207 USD) for completing a test assignment. This transaction was also\nconfirmed by TRM on-chain analysis.\n\nThe on-chain investigation also confirmed a transfer of $85,000 USD from Stern to a team\nlead on one of the Conti teams operating under the alias “Mango.” The transfer was made to\npay for the salary of Mango’s team. Mango requested the transfer from Stern on July 19,\n2021, according to the leaks, so that the funds could then be split across the team of nearly\n100 people consisting of pentesters, coders, OSINT investigators, and reverse engineers.\nSome of the funds were also set aside for payments for servers and test assignments for\nnew hires according to the chats between Stern and Mango.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Source: TRM Labs_\nFurther investigation identified that the funds for the aforementioned payment from Stern to\n[Mango were derived from a known Ryuk ransomware address reported by CrowdStrike in](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/big-game-hunting-with-ryuk-another-lucrative-targeted-ransomware/)\nJanuary of 2019. This financial transaction appears to confirm the long-suspected ties\nbetween Ryuk and Conti and underscores the widely adopted tactics of rebranding by\n[ransomware syndicates to cover their tracks, described by BleepingComputer. However,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/conti-ransomware-shows-signs-of-being-ryuks-successor/)\ndespite the rebranding, the cryptocurrency financial transactions carried out by the groups\nleave a trail, which can be uncovered, as TRM shows.\n\n_Source: TRM Labs_\nThe chats further revealed that Wizard Spider is also working on putting together a team that\nwill attempt to develop an internal Blockchain platform and its own token to circumvent\ncryptocurrency tracking by law enforcement and researchers.\n\n\n-----\n\n_We want to create our own cryptosystem such as etherium, polkadot, and binance smart_\n_chain,” Stern said to their team members on June 28, 2021. “We need to study the_\n_principles, code, and other things to be able to build on. And then, we will be able to integrate_\n_NFT, DEFI, DEX, and all the existing and upcoming trends,” they added._\n\n_“Do we think that any of us are gurus of Blockchain and trends? Anyone has any idea the_\n_direction we can take to develop it?”, Stern continued on July 8, 2021. Stern’s crypto_\naspirations were met with less enthusiasm from other threat actors such as Mango: “This is a\n_great idea, but very complicated at the same time. Let’s be realistic, we can’t handle it on our_\n_own with so little experience and resources.”_\n\nDespite the fact that the Blockchain project still has not been developed, the threat actors’\ninterest in expanding into the cryptocurrency and the Defi space does raise significant\nconcern. Based on the chats, the overall goal for Wizard Spider is to create a threat actorfriendly blockchain product. TRM assesses with a high level of confidence that would provide\nan additional stream of revenue as well as an internally controlled payment environment for\nthe cybercrime underground.\n\n### Wizard Spider Likely to Remain a Threat\n\nTRM assesses that Wizard Spider will continue to be a significant threat despite recent\nsetbacks, notably the phasing out of their long used TrickBot tool at the beginning of\nFebruary due to its high detection followed by the leak of internal Conti’s information. Wizard\nSpider quickly resumed their operations, posting its first victim on March 2, 2022, on their\nextortion site. As of March 23, 2022, the syndicate published 41 victims in total with 22 of\nthem being US entities. These victims are likely to have been breached by Wizard Spider\nbefore the leak and it is unclear if the syndicate was able to obtain access to any new victims\nsince then.\n\nBased on tracking the continued level of activity and messages posted by Wizard Spider,\nTRM analysts assess that the group is likely to fully restore their operational capacity in the\nnear future and will continue to run their operations under the same name and not rebrand.\nUnlike several other major ransomware operations, which have stated publicly and on the\ndark web that they do not target critical infrastructure, Conti/Ryuk has continued to target the\nhealthcare system even during the COVID-19 pandemic as noted in the Health & Human\nServices report “Conti Ransomware and the Health Sector.”\n\nProprietary source reporting has indicated that several other ransomware groups have\nstruggled to keep up with all of the entities they have gained access to or to develop an\neffective pipeline of accesses, due to a lack of employees such as programmers,\nnegotiators, and others. Conti’s focus on hiring can be seen as evidence of Conti’s efforts to\nbe able to run their operation on an industrial scale, bringing things like gaining access and\ndistribution of the malware in house, allowing them to net hundreds of millions in victim\npayments over the years, based on TRM analysis.\n\n\n-----\n\nConti s hiring process consists of the interview and test assignment to measure the\ncandidate’s skills level. In order to attract new employees “Salamandra”, the threat actor in\ncharge of the group’s HR, utilizes many available resources, from dark web forums to the\nRussian commercial job posting site hh[.]ru.\n\n_Image: Russian commercial job posting site hh[.]ru_\nBased on the chats, the average salary for threat actors is nearly $2,000 USD a month.\nWhile that salary is nearly two times higher than the average salary in the IT industry in\nRussia according to salaryexplorer[.]com, the compensation can seem low when compared\nto the millions of dollars in payments that Wizard Spider received from its victims. The ability\nto spend a relatively small percentage of their income on salaries may be one of the reasons\nthe core members of Wizard Spider preferred to work with full-time employees as opposed to\nthe profit-sharing ransomware-as-a-service that most other ransomware groups currently\nprefer.\n\n### Outlook\n\nTRM is monitoring the discussion of the leaked chats on the dark web to get a sense of the\nopinions of other threat actors about the arrangement. In the past, programmers on the dark\nweb have leaked the source code for malware in retaliation when they felt that they had not\nbeen paid a sufficient percentage of the profit it generated, as happened in the case of the\nBuhtrap leak according to proprietary sources.\n\nThe research done by TRM analysts demonstrates how critical tracking the flow of funds can\nbe in understanding the operation of cybercriminal organizations. Although cryptocurrency\nhas made it possible for ransomware to run successful operations for years and provides a\nhigh level of return on investment for threat actors’ efforts, TRM blockchain analytical tool\n\n\n-----\n\nallows investigations to follow the flow of funds and uncover valuable intelligence that helps\nto connect the dots. TRM continues to monitor Wizard Spider’s activity both on and off-chain\nto help mitigate the risk posed by Conti ransomware.\n\nConsidering Wizard Spider’s statement on supporting the Russian State and sharing its\npolitical agenda, and their past willingness to target critical infrastructure, the syndicate might\nalso pose a risk to national security due to its level of sophistication.\n\n## About TRM Labs\n\nTRM provides blockchain intelligence to help financial institutions, cryptocurrency\nbusinesses, and public agencies detect, investigate, and manage crypto-related fraud and\nfinancial crime.
