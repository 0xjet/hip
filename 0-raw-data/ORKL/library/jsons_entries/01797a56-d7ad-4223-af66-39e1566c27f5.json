In past revivals, the botnet has](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/keeping-up-with-the-andromeda-botnet/)\nbeen distributed through malicious emails containing attachments or links to\ncompromised websites hosting exploit kit content. What makes this botnet successful\nis its highly configurable and modular design that can fit any malicious intent, like\n[distributing Zeus or, more recently, distributing a Lethic bot.](http://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/threat-encyclopedia/malware/zeus)\n\n[Earlier this year, the Andromeda botnet was seen using macro-based malware, which](https://blog.gdatasoftware.com/blog/article/the-andromedagamarue-botnet-is-on-the-rise-again.html)\nis yet again an [old trick. What makes this interesting is how the dated botnet and](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/macro-malware-when-old-tricks-still-work-part-1/)\nmacro malware trick are used together. Indeed, the past few months seem to be quite\nbusy for the Andromeda botnet and its recent activity indicates its operators’ intent in\nthe United States.\n\n## Threat Details\n\n### Infection Chain\n\nFigure 1. Andromeda to GamaPoS infection chain\n\n\n-----\n\n### Stage 1: Botnet Entry\n\nAndromeda is delivered to the desktop either through spammed emails or\nexploit kit content:\n\n1. Emails with macro-enabled Microsoft™ Word® documents are usually within\nthe context of invoice, payment, or sometimes an individual’s resume.\n\nFigure 2. W2KM_DLOADR.WJP, with a fake invoice, leading to a download of Andromeda\n\nSimilar to the recently distributed macro malware, the attached document\ninstructs the end user to download and enable its content. This allows the\nmacro malware to execute, thus completing the initial infection of Andromeda.\n\nFigure 3. Document body, with macro routine\n\nThere are a total of nine domains used in this campaign, which is found to be\nhosted in one IP address 80[dot]242[dot]123[dot]144.The domains are listed in the ‘Indicators’ section.\n\n\n-----\n\n2. Aside from spammed emails, compromised web sites leading to exploit-kit\n\nenabled websites were observed as well. During this time, the Rig Exploit Kit\nwas utilized and SWF_EXPLOYT.YYJX was delivered to endpoints. The final\npayload are usually Nullsoft Scriptable Install System (NSIS) packaged\nexecutables that bundle TROJ_YASIBU.SS or TSPY_SEKUR.YL . These lead\naffected endpoints to download Andromeda binaries hosted on the IP\naddress 80[dot]242[dot]123[dot]144, similar to the spam email and macroenabled Word document combination.\n\nBased on Trend Micro™ Smart Protection Network™ data, the macro-enabled\nWord document was the most successful entry vector in the United States. The\nmain IP address 80[dot]242[dot]123[dot]144 has been active since the first\nweek of May 2015, as shown below:\n\nFigure 4. Activity for the main IP address hosting Andromeda\n\nThere are nine domains that are used in this IP address. Correlating this back to\nthe initial entry point, the domain andropaul.com had the most number of\nlookups and was used by most macro-enabled Word documents\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5. Domain usage distribution\n\nGlobally, the United States (85%) is the top traffic source for the main IP\naddress 80[dot]242[dot]123[dot]144, followed by Canada (2%):\n\nFigure 6. Global distribution of Andromeda-related traffic\n\nWe can say that this campaign has brought more bots under the control of the\nAndromeda botnet than other campaigns.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Stage 2: Secondary Infection and Ensuring Control\n\nThe main purpose of spreading Andromeda is to cast a wide net and gain\ncontrol of endpoints, effectively making them bots or zombies. These bots can\nnow be controlled via a control panel to perform different commands such as\ndownloading and executing files, performing remote shell, or even uninstalling\nitself from a system.\n\nUpon entry, Andromeda introduces the following files to the system:\n\n  - A copy of PsExec, a legitimate administrative tool in the Sysinternals\n\nSuite\n\n  - A copy of 32-bit or 64-bit mimikatz, a tool to recover clear text\n\npasswords from LSASS\n\n  - Several secondary downloaders, coded in .NET framework\n\n  - And finally, GamaPoS, which is also coded in .NET\n\nThe combination of mimikatz and PsExec on the affected host furthers\nthe control over the endpoint. The endpoint acts as a launch pad for\ndeeper exploration in the network as the mimikatz tool can be used to\ndump credentials and PsExec can enable lateral movement for the threat\nactor. On certain instances, GamaPoS is installed.\n\n\n-----\n\n## GamaPoS – a .NET Scraper\n\nWhen loading, GamaPoS evaluates a list of URLs to see which command-and-control\n(C&C) server or control panel is up and running. There are usually a few hard-coded\nURLs.\n\nFigure 7. Initial start-up, selecting a control panel\n\nThe communication is done in HTTPS and, once a good panel has been selected, it\ncontinues execution. GamaPoS only needs one panel to execute. It evaluates the list\nfrom top to bottom.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8. GamaPoS monitoring processes\n\nThere are no process exemptions and GamaPoS goes through all processes and\ndumps Track 2 data. Using the MAC address as the file name, unique card number\nvalues are then stored in a text file in the folder being used by the malware (in this\ncase, %UserAppdata%\\Intel Wired Network Adapter).\n\nFigure 9. Main data management and exfiltration of GamaPoS\n\nFinally, it attempts to upload the collected data via the C&C server that has been\nchosen during initial execution.\n\nWhile the evaluated example does not do Luhn validation, GamaPoS manually filters\nthe data by evaluating the first few numbers:\n\n  - 4  (length=12) – Visa\n\n  - 56 to 59 (length=14) – Maestro and other ATM/debit cards\n\n\n-----\n\n- 6011 (length=12) – Discover Card\n\n- 65 (length=14) – Discover\n\n### Other Observed Movements\n\nIn the process of classifying indicators related to GamaPoS, we came across a\nNullsoft Scriptable Install System (NSIS) package (SHA1: ea0d041f35786966b65ff24ea842b64ae09fd8e5) that was issued to “\n\nELVIK\nOOO”:\n\nFigure 10. Certificate issued to an organization “ELVIK OOO”\n\nThe name seems to represent Общество `с` `ограниченной`\n```\n ответственностью \"ЭлВик\", or Limited Liability Company \"Elvik\". While we\n\n```\nare not able to verify the validity of this digital certificate, we have seen\nsimilarly signed binaries dropped after executing documents that contain\n[exploits for CVE-2012-0158 or CVE-2014-1761. What’s even more interesting is](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-0158)\nthat these documents had found their way to some banks. These files were\ndistributed in Europe and Asia, which is not surprising as operators of\n[Andromeda had move and dropped financial malware on European targets](http://www.certego.net/en/news/andromeda-gamarue-botnet-dropping-financial-malware-hits-italian-and-german-users/)\nbeforehand.\n\nFor example, we have seen a file (SHA1:\nad4dff33228e15baddeb407a4863e6445fdf120f) of the same construction\ndownloaded from the following URLs:\n\n\n-----\n\nhttp://pos-softwareupdate[dot]com/<redacted>/pcicompliance.exe\nhttp://pos-softwareupdate[dot]com/microsupdate/microsupdate.exe\n\nIt should be noted that the URLs intend to hide in plain sight:\n\n       - The first URL refers to the targeted establishment. It was redacted at\n\nthe request of our customer. It is noticeable that the downloaded file\nhas a name of pcicompliance.exe so as to fool the end user to\ndownload a file that would assist in complying with the Payment Card\nIndustry (PCI) Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) or PCI compliance.\n\n       - The other URL microsupdate.exe is made to look like an update for\n\nthe point-of-sale platform Oracle® MICROS®.\n\nThe certificate used and the reference to a possible PoS target links to\nthis particular event to Andromeda. The tactics may be different from\npreviously described uses of Andromeda and GamaPoS but are still\nworth noting.\n\n## Victimology\n\nSince GamaPoS is being distributed via spammed messages, we l up the threat in\n[scans done to HouseCall, HouseCall for Facebook, and Trend Micro™ Internet Security](http://housecall.trendmicro.com/)\nproduct users.\n\nHowever, looking at the macro-enabled Word documents and Andromeda, the targets\nfor GamaPoS are clearly businesses. We have seen files and URLs accessed on\nendpoints running Worry-Free™ Business Security Services (for small-to-medium sized\nbusinesses) and OfficeScan™ Corporate Edition (medium to large businesses).\nIndicators of GamaPoS have been found in the various establishments, as follows:\n\n  - Pet care\n\n  - Theatre\n\n  - Furniture wholesale\n\n  - Home health care\n\n  - Online market stores\n\n  - Consumer electronics company\n\n  - Records storage facility\n\n  - Employment agency and professional services\n\n  - Credit union\n\n\n-----\n\n  - Restaurant\n\n  - Software developer for insurance\n\n  - Software developer for telecoms\n\n  - Industrial supply distributor\n\nFigure 11. Distribution of GamaPoS victims\n\nOwing to the fact that the files hosted on the initial distribution of Andromeda held\ntwo utilities of note (PsExec and mimikatz) that can be used for further penetration, we’re cautiously watching infections on these endpoints.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe use of an old botnet as a shotgun method to cast a wide net for targets has its\nmerits. Using spam and exploit kits to establish a large corpus of bots enables\noperators of the botnet to re-sell interested interesting targets to other threat actors.\n\nThe entry points used in this campaign highlights the need for:\n\n  - An effective spam filter that can evaluate attachments. We have discussed this\n\n[briefly in a blog post addressing macro malware.](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/macro-malware-when-old-tricks-still-work-part-2/)\n\n  - The need for patching to avoid known vulnerabilities from exploits and exploit\n\nkits\n\n\n-----\n\nAnother interesting move here was the deployment of PsExec and mimikatz – two\ntools that are widely used in targeted attacks. Trend Micro is monitoring the activity\nof this ongoing campaign. Indicators that were used as reference in this blog are listed\nbelow.\n\nTo enhance your security posture on your point-of-sale systems, please read\n[Defending against PoS RAM Scrapers: Current Strategies and Next-Gen](http://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/defending-against-pos-ram-scrapers-strategies-and-technologies)\n[Technologies.
