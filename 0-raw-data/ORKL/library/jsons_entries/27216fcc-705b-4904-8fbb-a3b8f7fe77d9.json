Research was_\n_conducted using the Recorded Future® Platform and other open sources._\n_[Join Insikt Group for a live Threat Briefing and Q&A on February 23 at 10AM ET - Register](https://recordedfuture.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_cMs5asJGS92vwqmIRyjZsg)_\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nIn the event of a renewed Russian invasion of Ukraine, we believe it is likely that cyber\noffensive actions targeting Ukraine will primarily consist of distributed denial-of-service\nattacks and website defacements against Ukrainian government and media\norganizations, internet infrastructure, and e-services used by Ukrainian citizens such as\ndigital banking. These cyberattacks would likely aim to cause confusion, hinder\ncommunications, weaken a Ukrainian military response, and demoralize the Ukrainian\npopulation as part of a wider hybrid warfare operation.\nRussia is almost certainly using influence assets and techniques, both covertly and\novertly, to shape domestic, Ukrainian, and international audience perceptions of its\nmilitary buildup along Ukraine’s northern, southern, and eastern borders. Key influence\nnarratives include that Russia, not Ukraine, is a victim of aggression; that Russia is a\ndefensive protector; and allegations of infighting among NATO partners.\nInsikt Group has not observed Russian troop or asset withdrawal from the border of\nUkraine, and we have observed additional troops and specialized equipment moving\ntowards Ukraine, in line with US, NATO, and Ukrainian assessments. We further\nconcur with assessments that Russia is plotting a false-flag operation as a pretext for a\nRussian invasion of Ukraine, with an increased presence of Russian private military\ncompanies and recent examples of likely false-flag operations being conducted. In\naddition, the Russian State Duma has prepared legislation to formally recognize the\nindependence of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) and Luhansk\nPeople’s Republic (LPR).\n\n## Cyber Offensive Actions\n\n**Recent Cyber Offensive Actions Targeting Ukraine Recent cyberattacks targeting Ukraine**\nhave aligned with Russia’s strategic objectives. The cyberattacks have consisted of\ndistributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, website defacements, fraudulent messaging,\nand malware attacks, predominantly targeting Ukrainian government organizations, media\n\n\n-----\n\norganizations, e-services used by citizens, and other private sector organizations. Notable\nattacks are listed below:\n\n[DDoS — On February 15, 2022, powerful DDoS attacks targeted Ukraine’s armed](https://therecord.media/ddos-attacks-hit-websites-of-ukraines-state-banks-defense-ministry-and-armed-forces/)\nforces, defense ministry, public radio, and the 2 largest national banks, knocking some\nservices offline for 2 hours. The DDoS attacks left Ukrainians unable to use some vital\nservices and resulted in confusion and worry as Russian forces continue to gather on\n[the Ukrainian border. There has been further DDoS activity since, including targeting of](https://t.me/zedigital/1056)\nthe Government Services Portal of Ukraine, though there was reportedly no effect on\nthe website.\nFraudulent Messaging — In coordination with the DDoS attacks against Ukrainian\norganizations including banks on February 15, 2022, some users of Privatbank\n[received an SMS message alerting them that the bank’s ATMs were not working.](https://therecord.media/ddos-attacks-hit-websites-of-ukraines-state-banks-defense-ministry-and-armed-forces/)\nHowever, these messages were not sent by Privatbank, and Ukrainian cyber police\n[stated that “it was an information attack”.](https://cyberpolice.gov.ua/news/kiberpolicziya-vstanovlyuye-osib-prychetnyx-do-rozsylannya-sms-povidomlen-shhodo-zboyiv-u-roboti-bankomativ-7072/)\nWebsite Defacements — On January 14, 2022, threat actors likely serving Russian\n[strategic objectives defaced nearly 70 Ukrainian government websites, including](https://therecord.media/hackers-deface-ukrainian-government-websites/)\nwebsites belonging to the Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Defense, the\nState Emergency Service, Cabinet of Ministers, and Ministry of Education and Science.\nThe attacks were later suspected to have been conducted by Advanced Persistent\nThreat (APT) UNC1151, a group linked to the Belarusian government that used\nmalware bearing similarities to tools previously used by Russian state-sponsored\nAPT29. The defacements vaguely warned Ukrainians to “expect the worst”, spurring\nfears that the defacement is the beginning of additional threat activity preceding a\nRussian conventional military campaign in eastern Ukraine.\n[Malware — Data-wiping malware disguised as ransomware, dubbed WhisperGate,](https://www.recordedfuture.com/whispergate-malware-corrupts-computers-ukraine/)\n[targeted multiple industries in Ukraine, including government, non-profit, and](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2022/01/15/destructive-malware-targeting-ukrainian-organizations/)\ninformation technology organizations in January 2022. Ukraine’s CERT [indicated the](https://cert.gov.ua/article/18108)\nattacks were a false-flag operation, mimicking WhiteBlackCrypt ransomware, likely in\nan attempt to make attribution more difficult. Insikt Group [analyzed the WhisperGate](https://www.recordedfuture.com/whispergate-malware-corrupts-computers-ukraine/)\nmalware and created detection rules for our clients. We [support the false-flag](https://app.recordedfuture.com/live/sc/4b3Vc6IlMjS6)\nassessment and note that such tactics have previously been employed by Russian\n[threat actors when targeting Ukraine, for example the use of BadRabbit ransomware.](https://www.securityweek.com/uk-australia-blame-russia-bad-rabbit-other-attacks)\n\n**Dark Web and Cybercriminal Activity Involving Ukraine Insikt Group has identified a**\nsignificant uptick in dark web advertisements and sales of data and network access methods\nrelated to Ukraine in the last 3 months. We identified 7 Insikt Group Threat Leads related to\nUkraine in the last 12 months, with 6 of those being identified in the last 3 months. Per Insikt\nGroup’s report “Dark Covenant: Connections Between the Russian State and Criminal\nActors”, we believe it is highly likely that Russian intelligence services and law enforcement\nhave a longstanding, tacit understanding with criminal threat actors; in some cases, it is\nalmost certain that the intelligence services maintain an established and systematic\nrelationship with criminal threat actors, either through association or recruitment. Recently\nidentified events of interest include:\n\n\n-----\n\nOn February 2, 2022, we identified that an3key, a member of the mid-tier Raid\nForums, advertised a 904 GB data leak from the internal mail server of the Ministry of\nCommunities and Territories Development (minregion[.]gov[.]ua) of Ukraine.\nOn January 28, 2022, we identified that “Kristina”, a member of the mid-tier Raid\nForums, advertised a free document leak related to the Ukrainian National Police\n(mvs[.]gov[.]ua). Based on sample images and threat actor indications, the\ncompromised information includes scans of passports, identification cards, and other\nsensitive documents related to local and federal police officers throughout Ukraine and\noccupied territories.\nInsikt Group reported on February 10, 2022, that Raid Forums was offline for a week.\nSince its reopening the week of February 14, 2022, the forum is being viewed by users\nwith speculation, as the forum’s administrator “Omnipotent” remains unresponsive,\nother administrative-level accounts are acting irregular, and prominent threat actors on\nthe forum (who have operated on it for years) are abandoning their activities. We\ncannot confirm if the forum has been seized by law enforcement at this time, but the\naforementioned activities are leading threat actors to abandon the forum and move\ntheir activities elsewhere. This is a current and evolving situation, with Recorded Future\nmonitoring and providing relevant updates accordingly.\n\n**Assessment on Cyber Offensive Actions in the Event of a Russian Invasion In the**\nevent of a renewed Russian invasion of Ukraine, we believe it is likely that cyber offensive\nactions targeting Ukraine will primarily consist of DDoS attacks and website defacements\nagainst Ukrainian government and media organizations, internet infrastructure, and eservices used by Ukrainian citizens such as digital banking. These cyberattacks would likely\naim to cause confusion, hinder communications, weaken a Ukrainian military response, and\ndemoralize the Ukrainian population as part of a wider hybrid warfare operation.\n\nIt is also likely that a more significant cyberattack will target Ukrainian physical\ninfrastructure in the event of an invasion, reminiscent of previous cyberattacks against\nUkraine’s power supply and destructive pseudo-ransomware attacks. We believe it’s\nalmost certain that Russian state-sponsored APT groups have the capability to launch\nsuch significant and destructive attacks.\nWe expect Russian state-sponsored threat actors, pro-Russian hacktivist and criminal\ngroups enabled by the Russian government, and APT groups linked to the Belarusian\ngovernment likely supported by the Russian government to be involved in cyber\noffensive actions targeting Ukraine in the event of a renewed Russian invasion of the\ncountry.\nThe above assessments are based on Insikt Group’s analysis of Russian hybrid\nwarfare tactics targeting Estonia in 2007, Georgia in 2008, and Ukraine from 2014\nonwards.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Assessment on Cyber Offensive Actions Against Other Countries There are concerns**\nthat Russian state-sponsored cyberattacks could also be launched against organizations\n[outside of Ukraine in conjunction with a Russian military invasion of Ukraine. The US and the](https://www.cisa.gov/shields-up)\n[UK have issued warnings to this extent. We believe these concerns are justified based on](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/uk-organisations-encouraged-to-take-action-around-ukraine-situation)\nprevious undisciplined Russian APT cyberattacks that were likely intended to target only\nUkraine but spread much wider. Furthermore, it’s plausible that Russia would seek to\nconduct cyberattacks against NATO countries to distract efforts and attention away from the\ninvasion of Ukraine.\n\nAn example of an undisciplined cyberattack likely intended to target Ukraine specifically\n[is Sandworm Team’s NotPetya attack in June 2017, which was estimated to have cost](https://www.wired.com/story/notpetya-cyberattack-ukraine-russia-code-crashed-the-world/)\nvictims more than $10 billion in total. The attack first targeted Ukrainian companies on\nJune 27, 2017, the eve of the Ukrainian holiday Constitution Day, but spread to other\ncountries, including the US, UK, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Australia, and even\n[Russia. Security company ESET claimed that 80% of victims were located in Ukraine.](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-40428967)\nThere was temporary disruption of public infrastructure and business, lasting\ndestruction of data, and significant economic damage across 65 countries.\n[Another example is the BadRabbit ransomware attack in October 2017, also attributed](https://www.wired.com/story/badrabbit-ransomware-notpetya-russia-ukraine/)\nto Russia, which similarly appeared to spread in an uncontrolled manner, affecting\norganizations primarily in Ukraine and Russia, but which also spread to other countries,\nincluding Turkey, Germany, Poland, Japan, South Korea, and the US.\n\n## Influence Operations\n\n**Russia’s Multi-faceted and Versatile Influence Ecosystem Shaping Perceptions of**\n**Military Build-up Russia is almost certainly using influence assets and techniques, both**\ncovertly and overtly, to shape domestic, Ukrainian, and international audience perceptions of\nits military buildup along Ukraine’s northern, southern, and eastern borders. We believe that\ncurrent Russian information operations are employing a multi-faceted and versatile approach\nto manipulate the narrative of this crisis, using developed human intelligence assets on the\nground in Ukraine, covert elements of Russia’s disinformation ecosystem (such as\nintelligence-directed or otherwise affiliated news sources), social media influence operations,\nand official, overt propaganda through the Russian state media and political apparatus.\n\nIt is likely that the overarching goal of these efforts is to promote the rise of a proRussian or Russian-friendly government at the local and national levels of Ukraine’s\ngovernment in the long term. In the short term, these tactics are more likely aimed at\ncreating a destabilizing environment before a possible Russian invasion, in an attempt\nat achieving victory more easily and with less cost (through loss of life, economic\ndamages, or other disruptions).\n\n\n-----\n\n[The Ukrainian SBU issued a statement on February 14, 2022, warning that the](https://ssu.gov.ua/en/novyny/zaiava-sbu-shchodo-proiaviv-hibrydnoi-viiny-v-informatsiinomu-prostori)\n“domestic information space is under unprecedented influence”, stating that “Ukraine is\nfacing attempts to systemically sow panic, spread fake information and distort the real\nstate of affairs” and that “all this combined is nothing more than another massive wave\nof hybrid warfare”.\n[On February 9, 2022, the SBU announced that it had identified and shut down a social](https://ssu.gov.ua/novyny/sbu-likviduvala-18ty-tysiachnu-botofermu-u-lvovi-pid-kuratorstvom-rf-siialy-paniku-ta-minuvaly-obiekty-video)\nmedia bot farm consisting of 18,000 social media accounts allegedly spreading panic\non social media as well as allegations of bomb threats on civilian and critical\ninfrastructure.\n\n**Key Themes of Russian Influence Operations Involving Ukraine Insikt Group has**\nobserved ongoing Russian covert and overt influence operations promoting a false primary\nnarrative that Russia, not Ukraine, is a victim of aggression. These sources, often\ncollectively, promote allegations and statements claiming that Ukraine, with support from its\nWestern partners, is preparing to launch an offensive in eastern Ukraine. Often, we have\nfound that these claims originate from proxies in eastern Ukraine (that is, pro-Russian\nseparatists and their leadership), and then are amplified in Russian state media and\ngovernment sources.\n\nIn support of this larger theme, anti-American and anti-Ukrainian disinformation\nnarratives in Russian sources tend to portray Russia as a defensive protector, while\nbroadly accusing the West and Ukraine of unlawful and unjust actions. Additionally,\nthese sources present NATO, the US, and Ukraine as the aggressors, alleging human\nrights violations against Russian minorities in Ukraine, demonizing Ukrainians as\n“fascists” and “neo-Nazis” and claiming that Ukraine does not follow the internationally\nrecognized Minsk Agreements.\nOther widespread themes more recently include allegations of infighting among NATO\npartners suggesting that the West cannot achieve a consensus on how to manage\nRussia, as well as negative portrayals of Western media, claiming that Western news\noutlets spread malicious information about Russia in an attempt to force it into a war\nwith Ukraine.\n\n## Geopolitics and Physical Threats\n\n**Russian Military Activities Insikt Group has not observed Russian troop or asset**\nwithdrawal from the border of Ukraine, despite official Russian government and media\nreports of troops withdrawal. We observed new videos and photos posted on social media\ncontinuing to show troops and specialized equipment moving towards Ukraine, in line with\n[the US, NATO, and Ukrainian assessments that Russia has in fact added 7,000 troops to the](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/02/16/politics/russian-troops-biden-administration/index.html)\nborder. The latest US assessments [indicate that Russia has massed between 169,000 and](https://osce.usmission.gov/u-s-statement-for-the-vienna-document-joint-pc-fsc-chapter-iii-meeting-2/)\n190,000 personnel in and near Ukraine, and we believe that Russia is in fact increasing the\ncapabilities of its military on the border with Ukraine.\n\n\n-----\n\n[US intelligence assessments state that a Russian invasion of Ukraine will likely start](https://edition.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-news-02-14-22-intl/h_048d5677373fa7c2b2f94a88d659f717)\nwith air and missile attacks on key Ukrainian military infrastructure, including airfields,\nair defense, and early warning systems, and that the Russian military is likely to invade\nfrom multiple points on the Ukrainian border in the east and the north, in an attempt to\nsurround Kyiv within 1-2 days. Indeed, the Estonian Foreign Intelligence Service\n[released a report showing “targets in Ukraine compiled by Russian intelligence that, if](https://raport.valisluureamet.ee/en/russian-armed-forces/russia-is-ready-for-war/)\nneutralized, can interfere with the command, recovery, and supply of the Ukrainian\nArmed Forces and Ukraine’s energy supply”.\n[Russia’s military exercises with Belarus will conclude on February 20, 2022, as will the](https://www.npr.org/2022/02/10/1079888622/russia-military-exercise-belarus-ukraine?t=1645021439624)\nBeijing Winter Olympics, which we believe will be a pivotal moment to observe whether\nRussia does indeed decide to withdraw troops and military assets from Belarus and the\nborder with Ukraine.\n\n**Provocations and False-Flag Operations Insikt Group concurs with the US, UK, NATO,**\nand other [assessments that Russia is plotting false-flag operations as a pretext for a Russian](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-59998988)\ninvasion of Ukraine. We have observed discourse from Russian politicians suggesting there’s\na high probability that Ukraine will launch a military offensive in Donbas, that Russia has a\nright to “counterattack” if it felt the need to protect Russian citizens living in eastern Ukraine,\nthat Russia is concerned about reports of Ukrainian violence in Donbas and is closely\nmonitoring the situation, and Putin comparing the actions of Ukraine in Donbas to genocide.\n[Furthermore, Russian private military companies have reportedly increased their presence in](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/exclusive-russian-mercenaries-with-spy-links-increasing-presence-ukraine-western-2022-02-14/)\nUkraine, presenting the Russian government with a further avenue to conduct a false-flag\noperation. We have observed recent instances of potential false-flag attempts, including the\nshelling of a kindergarten in Donbas.\n\n[On February 16, Kremlin Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov told reporters that there is a](https://edition.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-news-02-16-22-intl/h_8fe19dd2e95905e0cac7210fb7482cf3)\nhigh probability that Ukraine will launch a military offensive in Donbas.

There were a further 402 ceasefire violations,\nincluding 188 explosions, in the Luhansk region. This represents a significant increase\nfrom the previous day, with 24 and 129 ceasefire violations, respectively.\n\n**Russian Government Prepares Legislation to Formally Recognize LPR and DPR On**\n[February 15, 2022, the Russian State Duma adopted a draft resolution on an appeal to the](https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-luhansk-donetsk-duma-recognition/31704804.html)\nPresident of the Russian Federation with a request to recognize the independence of the\nself-proclaimed DPR and LPR.
