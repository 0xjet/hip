(IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) (NEA), section\n212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (8 U.S.C. 1182(f)), and section 301 of\ntitle 3, United States Code,\n\nI, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, find that specified\nharmful foreign activities of the Government of the Russian Federation — in particular, efforts\nto undermine the conduct of free and fair democratic elections and democratic institutions in\nthe United States and its allies and partners; to engage in and facilitate malicious cyberenabled activities against the United States and its allies and partners; to foster and use\ntransnational corruption to influence foreign governments; to pursue extraterritorial activities\ntargeting dissidents or journalists; to undermine security in countries and regions important to\nUnited States national security; and to violate well-established principles of international law,\nincluding respect for the territorial integrity of states — constitute an unusual and\n\n\n-----\n\nextraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.\nI hereby declare a national emergency to deal with that threat.\nAccordingly, I hereby order:\nSection 1. All property and interests in property that are in the United States, that\nhereafter come within the United States, or that are or hereafter come within the possession\nor control of any United States person of the following persons are blocked and may not be\ntransferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in:\n(a) any person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the\nSecretary of State, and, with respect to subsection (a)(ii) of this section, in consultation with\nthe Attorney General, or by the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of the\nTreasury, and, with respect to subsection (a)(ii) of this section, in consultation with the\nAttorney General:\n(i)  to operate or have operated in the technology sector or the defense and related\nmateriel sector of the Russian Federation economy, or any other sector of the Russian\nFederation economy as may be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation\nwith the Secretary of State;\n(ii)  to be responsible for or complicit in, or to have directly or indirectly engaged or\nattempted to engage in, any of the following for or on behalf of, or for the benefit of, directly\nor indirectly, the Government of the Russian Federation:\n(A) malicious cyber-enabled activities;\n(B) interference in a United States or other foreign government election;\n(C) actions or policies that undermine democratic processes or institutions in\nthe United States or abroad;\n(D) transnational corruption;\n(E) assassination, murder, or other unlawful killing of, or infliction of other bodily\nharm against, a United States person or a citizen or national of a United States ally or\npartner;\n(F) activities that undermine the peace, security, political stability, or territorial\nintegrity of the United States, its allies, or its partners; or\n(G) deceptive or structured transactions or dealings to circumvent any United\nStates sanctions, including through the use of digital currencies or assets or the use of\nphysical assets;\n(iii) to be or have been a leader, official, senior executive officer, or member of the\nboard of directors of:\n(A) the Government of the Russian Federation;\n(B) an entity that has, or whose members have, engaged in any activity described\nin subsection (a)(ii) of this section; or\n(C) an entity whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this\norder;\n(iv)  to be a political subdivision, agency, or instrumentality of the Government of the\nRussian Federation;\n(v)  to be a spouse or adult child of any person whose property and interests in\n\n\n-----\n\nproperty are blocked pursuant to subsection (a)(ii) or (iii) of this section;\n(vi)  to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or\ntechnological support for, or goods or services to or in support of:\n(A) any activity described in subsection (a)(ii) of this section; or\n(B) any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to\nthis order; or\n(vii) to be owned or controlled by, or to have acted or purported to act for or on behalf\nof, directly or indirectly, the Government of the Russian Federation or any person whose\nproperty and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order.\n(b) any person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the\nSecretary of State, to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or\ntechnological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, a government whose\nproperty and interests in property are blocked pursuant to chapter V of title 31 of the Code of\nFederal Regulations or another Executive Order, and to be:\n(i)  a citizen or national of the Russian Federation;\n(ii)  an entity organized under the laws of the Russian Federation or any jurisdiction\nwithin the Russian Federation (including foreign branches); or\n(iii) a person ordinarily resident in the Russian Federation.\n(c) any person determined by the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of\nthe Treasury, to be responsible for or complicit in, or to have directly or indirectly engaged in\nor attempted to engage in, cutting or disrupting gas or energy supplies to Europe, the\nCaucasus, or Asia, and to be:\n(i)  an individual who is a citizen or national of the Russian Federation; or\n(ii) an entity organized under the laws of the Russian Federation or any jurisdiction\nwithin the Russian Federation (including foreign branches).\n(d) The prohibitions in subsections (a), (b), and (c) of this section apply except to the\nextent provided by statutes, or in regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that may be\nissued pursuant to this order, and notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or\npermit granted before the date of this order.\nSec. 2. The prohibitions in section 1 of this order include:\n(a) the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for\nthe benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to\nthis order; and\n(b) the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such\nperson.\nSec. 3. (a) The unrestricted immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of\nnoncitizens determined to meet one or more of the criteria in section 1 of this order would be\ndetrimental to the interests of the United States, and the entry of such persons into the\nUnited States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, is hereby suspended, except when the\nSecretary of State or the Secretary of Homeland Security, as appropriate, determines that\nthe person’s entry would not be contrary to the interests of the United States, including when\nthe Secretary of State or the Secretary of Homeland Security, as appropriate, so determines,\n\n\n-----\n\nbased on a recommendation of the Attorney General, that the person s entry would further\nimportant United States law enforcement objectives.\n(b) The Secretary of State shall implement this authority as it applies to visas pursuant to\nsuch procedures as the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland\nSecurity, may establish.\n(c) The Secretary of Homeland Security shall implement this order as it applies to the\nentry of noncitizens pursuant to such procedures as the Secretary of Homeland Security, in\nconsultation with the Secretary of State, may establish.\n(d) Such persons shall be treated by this section in the same manner as persons covered\nby section 1 of Proclamation 8693 of July 24, 2011 (Suspension of Entry of Aliens Subject to\nUnited Nations Security Council Travel Bans and International Emergency Economic Powers\nAct Sanctions).\nSec. 4. (a) Any transaction that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or\navoiding, causes a violation of, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this\norder is prohibited.\n(b) Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is\nprohibited.\nSec. 5. I hereby determine that the making of donations of the types of articles specified\nin section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(2)) by, to, or for the benefit of any person\nwhose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order would seriously\nimpair my ability to deal with the national emergency declared in this order, and I hereby\nprohibit such donations as provided by section 1 of this order.\nSec. 6. For the purposes of this order:\n(a) the term “entity” means a partnership, association, trust, joint venture, corporation,\ngroup, subgroup, or other organization;\n(b) the term “Government of the Russian Federation” means the Government of the\nRussian Federation, any political subdivision, agency, or instrumentality thereof, including the\nCentral Bank of the Russian Federation, and any person owned, controlled, or directed by, or\nacting for or on behalf of, the Government of the Russian Federation;\n(c) the term “noncitizen” means any person who is not a citizen or noncitizen national of\nthe United States;\n(d) the term “person” means an individual or entity; and\n(e) the term “United States person” means any United States citizen, lawful permanent\nresident, entity organized under the laws of the United States or any jurisdiction within the\nUnited States (including foreign branches), or any person in the United States.\nSec. 7. For those persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant\nto this order who might have a constitutional presence in the United States, I find that\nbecause of the ability to transfer funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such\npersons of measures to be taken pursuant to this order would render those measures\nineffectual. I therefore determine that for these measures to be effective in addressing the\nnational emergency declared in this order, there need be no prior notice of a listing or\ndetermination made pursuant to section 1 of this order.\n\n\n-----\n\nSec. 8. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is\nhereby authorized to take such actions, including the promulgation of rules and regulations,\nand to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA, as may be necessary to carry\nout the purposes of this order. The Secretary of the Treasury may, consistent with applicable\nlaw, redelegate any of these functions within the Department of the Treasury. All\ndepartments and agencies of the United States shall take all appropriate measures within\ntheir authority to carry out the provisions of this order.\nSec. 9. Nothing in this order shall prohibit transactions for the conduct of the official\nbusiness of the Federal Government or the United Nations (including its specialized\nagencies, programs, funds, and related organizations) by employees, grantees, and\ncontractors thereof.\nSec. 10. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is\nhereby authorized to submit recurring and final reports to the Congress on the national\nemergency declared in this order, consistent with section 401(c) of the NEA (50 U.S.C.\n1641(c)) and section 204(c) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1703(c)).\nSec. 11. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i)  the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head\nthereof; or\n(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to\nbudgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the\navailability of appropriations.\n(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or\nprocedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its\ndepartments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\n\nJOSEPH R.
