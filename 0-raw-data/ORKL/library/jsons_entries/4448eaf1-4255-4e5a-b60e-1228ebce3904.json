The resulting reports were part of the Threat\nMonitoring service offered to paying Sentryo customers. Following the second wave of attacks in December\n2016, the Sentryo team has decided to publish a public version of this report to share this review. This also\n**includes a technical part on the newly found malware called INDUSTROYER/CrashOverride supposedly**\n**used during the second attack.** This article also includes a section about **the NotPetya attack** which\nrecently targeted many Ukrainian businesses and companies doing business with Ukraine.\n\nIT cybersecurity analysts tend to look at the attack vectors in depth. They provide great details about the\nway attacks are developed focusing on the technical perspective. Is the design well made? Does it embed\nlots of different hacking techniques (0day, obfuscation, etc.)? We think this approach is misleading in the\ngrowing field of OT Monitoring cybersecurity. Attack vectors are definitely part of the problem but their\nphysical impact must be careful analysed. OT impacts safety, health and environment where IT is about data.\nOT impact is about casualties not only money and data losses.\n\nMoreover, fear mongering (i.e. tricks to have fear drive the sales process) is not part of the Sentryo culture.\nThat’s why we are being very careful and trying to distinguish what can be taken as true from what is,\nbecause there is no other evidence, pure speculation. In this document, the reader will have an overview\n**of Facts and Claims made in the cybersecurity community and Sentryo’s views on the subject. Our goal is**\nalso to share our analysis to the whole SCADA/ICS/DCS/OT security community. Threat intelligence shall be\nseen as an ongoing public debate between different skilled experts such as instrumentation engineers,\n**control engineers, cybersecurity experts, CISOs, forensics gurus, etc.**\n\nWe welcome any feedback or updates to this document and will definitely include all evidence that is\nlacking in this version. This document also includes a great contribution that will stress the need for more\nThreat Information Sharing. We warmly thank its author.\n\nTo ease the reading and provide a quasi executive summary, we will start with a detailed potential scenario\nof the first 2015 attack which has been documented. Please note that 2016 incidents do not have enough\ndocumentation to provide such a scenario description. It should also be noted that the attack campaign has\napparently continued since early january 2017 with new technical elements coming to light regularly.\nCheck out the Sentryo website to download the latest version.\n\n**At Sentryo, we remain committed to helping industrial asset owners, including when they face a crisis.**\n**Do not hesitate to contact us!**\n\n\n-----\n\n### 05\n\n\n### 06\n\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY: POTENTIAL\nSCENARIO FOR THE FIRST ATTACK\n\n### 10\n\n2017 ANOTHER MASSIVE\nINFECTION \"NOTPETYA\"\n\n### 12\n\nUSING SENTRYO ICS CYBERVISION\nTO COPE WITH SUCH ATTACKS\n\n\n### 11\n\n\n### 10\n\n\n### 15\n\n\nFACTS & REPORTS\n\n### 11\n\nCLAIMS\n\n### 14\n\nTHE NEED OF THREAT INFORMATION\nSHARING BY VYTAUTAS BUTRIMAS\n\n**Les contributeurs :**\n\n\n### 12\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n\n### 14\n\n\nLaurent Hausermann - Sentryo Co-founder & COO / Patrice Bock - Sentryo Customer Success Manager\nRomain Francoise - Sentryo CTO / Antoine de Nervaux - Sentryo Security Engineer\n\n\n-----\n\nDUE TO THE ANALYSIS AND DATA DEVELOPED IN THE PRESENT DOCUMENT, WE ARE ABLE TO DESCRIBE\nTHE MOST PROBABLE ATTACK SCENARIO. INDEED, IT APPEARS THAT IT WAS TARGETING THE CORE OF THE\nINDUSTRIAL NETWORK:\n\n# 1 2 3\n\n**It started with a spear phishing** At that point the attackers were\n\nIt infected the network using\n\n**email campaign targeting IT** able to retrieve VPN credentials\n\n**BlackEnergy version 3.**\n\nemployees. **to access the industrial**\n\n**network.**\n\n# 6 5 4\n\nThe attackers used KillDisk to They disabled backup power,\n\nFinally, they performed a **delete the master boot record** opened grid breakers and\n**telephone denial-of-service** **of critical industrial systems,** overwrote serial-to-ethernet\n**attack on the call center right** **delete logs and erase** firmware which is used\nafter the attack occurred. **software to communicate** **to manipulate**\n\n**with breakers.** **grid breakers.**\n\n\u0007The scale of the attack was able to cut power in a whole geographic area of Ukraine as three independent electricity distributors were\n**simultaneously attacked.**\n\n\u0007They also used hacking techniques to support and amplify the cyberattack. Their goal was clearly to stop, or at least slow down, operations\n**during the power restore processes.**\n\n\u0007Finally, they performed a telephone denial-of-service attack on the call center. Citizens were not able to call their power operator thus\namplifying an already chaotic situation.\n\n\u0007The impact of this attack was that more than 50 substations went offline and more than 200,000 homesremained without electricity\n**for a period of time. Ukrainian operators were able to restore power after 6 hours using manual on-site switches like in “the old days”.**\n\n\n-----\n\nTHE DECEMBER 23 OUTAGE AT WESTERN UKRAINE’S\nPRYKARPATTYAOBLENERGO/ IVANO-FRANKIVSK PLANT\nCUT POWER TO MANY CUSTOMERS FOR ABOUT SIX HOURS.\nREPORTS VARY FROM 80,000 TO 1.4 MILLION CUSTOMERS\nIMPACTED.\n\nVARIOUS ANALYSTS, INCLUDING ESET, A WELL KNOWN\nANTIVIRUS VENDOR, HAVE PROVIDED DEEP ANALYSIS\nOF THE MALWARE.\n\n\n**THEY FOUND THAT:**\n\n**1  \u0007The malware was distributed by a**\n“dropper”. This dropper was an Excel\nmacro embedded in **a** **malicious**\n**spreadsheet file.**\n\n**2  \u0007An updated analysis found that there**\nwas also an alternate attack based on **a**\n**Microsoft Word Document embedding**\n**macros.**\n\n**3  \u0007In reports about the December 2015**\nattack, the “dropper” used a variant of\n**the Black Energy (3[rd] version) trojan**\n(also called Lancafdo by Symantec). Black\nEnergy is not a new malware. It’s been\nused since 2007 in various campaigns\nincluding a famous one in 2014 against\nenergy companies. Black Energy enables\nattackers to control their malware via a\ncontrol center (C&C or C2) and enables\nthem to do horizontal propagation\n(moving from one computer to another).\n\n**4  \u0007In reports about a replica attack performed**\nin January 2016 (see next page for more\ndetails), the compromission chain was\ndifferent and Black Energy was replaced\nby **a custom-made malware payload**\n**based on a variant of the open-source**\n**gcat backdoor. Incidentally, the spear**\nphishing email contained an invisible\nPNG image to track when the victims\nviewed the email and the PNG was hosted\non a server located in France and hosted\n\n\nby Online SAS. The IP pointed to a domain\nname associated with **a Hong Kong**\n**company which was probably a collateral**\nvictim in this case (compromised web\nserver).\n\n**5  \u0007In the December campaign the attackers**\nlaunched a “wiper” named “KillDisk”\nor “Disakil”. This wiper is a destructive\nmalware. It is able to kill processes and\nservices on a server and also wipe (i.e.\nformat) the whole hard disk.\n\n**6  \u0007A known “feature” of Disakil is to stop**\nand delete a named service and write its\ncorresponding executable file on the hard\ndrive with random data in order to make\nrestoration of the system more difficult.\nDisakil was used against the service\ncalled “sec_service.exe”. This service\nappears to belong to ‘Serial to Ethernet\nConnector’ software by Eltima. This\nsoftware allows **access to remote serial**\n**ports over network connections. These**\nkinds of “remote serial” connections are\nused to pilot PLCs or RTUs which do not\nhave a way to connect via Ethernet (via a\ndedicated module). This is quite common\nin old installations that were deployed\n**before 2000.**\n\n**7  \u0007As of April 2016, it is still unclear if**\nthe attack itself (breaker opening)\nwas performed remotely using a\n\n\ndigital / computerized weapon or was the\n**result of a human and operational lapse**\nbut the likelihood of a digital weapon is\nhigh.\n\n**8  \u0007The organization NATO Cooperative Cyber**\nDefence Centre of Excellence (CCD COE)\nhas published a book called “Cyber War in\n**Perspective: Russian Aggression against**\n**Ukraine”. From this book, a presentation**\nat the BlackHat 2016 conference was\nperformed: “Cyber War in Perspective:\n**Analysis from the Crisis in Ukraine” by**\nKenneth Geers. This talk added some\ninteresting points to this analysis. Mainly,\nthe goal was also to steal VPN credentials\nto SCADA; to change passwords to access\nto the electric grid; to disable the backup\npower; to overwrite the serial-to-ethernet\nconverter firmware; to open 3 circuit\nbreakers; to launch the killdisk and to\nTDoS (Telephony Denial of Services)\ncustomer call center. The impact was\n**more than 50 substations offline and**\n**more than 200,000 homes without**\n**electricity.**\n\n\n-----\n\nFACTS & REPORTS\n\nON DECEMBER 18, 2016 THE SECOND POWER OUTAGE OCCURRED IN UKRAINE CAUSING SOME BLACKOUTS IN\nKIEV FOR LESS THAN ONE HOUR. THIS WAS THE TIME NEEDED FOR AN EXPERT TEAM TO GO ONSITE AND FIX\nTHE PROBLEM USING A MANUAL PROCEDURE.\n\n\naccounts, and determine the penetration\npoint while tracing computers potentially\ninfected with malware in sleep mode.\n\nSo far, no huge technical details related to\nthe attack have been released publically.\nIndeed Marina Krotofil from Honeywell and\nOleskii Yasinskiy from ISSP shared some\ninformation confirming the attack without\ngoing further concerning technical details\n**related to this attack.**\n\nAccording to CyberX, a targeted malware\ncampaign called **BugDrop could have**\nbeen performed in the reconnaissance\nphase. Indeed, the goal was to retrieve a\nmaximum amount of information regarding\nthe final target which was the power grid.\n**The complexity of the malware was quite**\n**impressive. Once the target was infected**\nthrough a targeted phishing campaign and\nthe malware deployed, it retrieved a lot\nof information from the network and also\nscreenshots, documents, passwords and\naudio recordings using the microphone.\nFor each infected target, the data was\nencrypted with Blowfish using a “user-ID”.\n**The exfiltration was performed through**\n**Dropbox services. The assumption linking**\n**this malware and the attack is detailed in**\n**the claims section below.**\n\n\nThis second attack was targeting another\ngrid company named **Ukrenergo. This**\nincident caused multiple blackouts in the\nUkrainian capital - Kiev and a complete\npower loss for the northern part of Kiev on\nthe right bank of the Dnieper river and the\nsurrounding region.\n\nExperts of the grid company were able to\nfix the situation in less than 1 hour with a\nmanual procedure. This emergency response\nteam was on site **30 minutes after the**\n**outage.**\n\nThe faulty component was the automation\n**control systems piloting a substation in**\na village near the Kiev city. Automation\nsystems in such substations control how\npower coming from power plants at high\nvoltage is transformed to lower voltage for\nconsumer and industrial use.\n\nThe main website of the power grid had\nbeen **unreachable for a couple of days**\nduring and after the attack. The head of\nUkrenergo had to publish a quick statement\non Facebook (provided in the appendix).\n\n**When the situation had been recovered, the**\n**company published an official statement**\n**available on their website.**\n\n\nIt states “Among the possible causes\nof failure are considered hacking and\nequipment malfunction (crashes). Timely\npolice were involved and conducted a\nthorough investigation into the accident,\nwhich will be to inform the public. By the\nend of the official investigation into the\ncase management of all objects SE ‘NEC’\nUkrenergo with automatic control system\nwas transferred to the local level.”\n\nIn the middle of January Ukrenergo\nconfirmed that the source cause of this\npower outage was **malicious. The authors**\nare still undetermined.\n\nBased on an article from Reuters,\nUkrenergo said in comments emailed to\nReuters: “Preliminary findings indicate that\nworkstations and Supervisory Control and\nData Acquisition (SCADA) systems, linked\nto the 330 kilowatt sub-station \"North\",\nwere influenced by external sources outside\nnormal parameters. [...] The analysis of the\nimpact of symptoms on the initial data of\nthese systems indicates a premeditated and\n**multilevel invasion”**\n\nLaw enforcement officials and cyber experts\nare still working to compile a chronology\nof events, draw up a list of compromised\n\n\n-----\n\nFACTS & REPORTS\n\nTHE 12[TH] OF JUNE 2017, RESEARCHER ANTON CHEREPANOV FROM ESET PUBLISHED A COMPREHENSIVE\nTECHNICAL REPORT REGARDING THE MALWARE CALLED INDUSTROYER. DRAGOS HAS ALSO PROVIDED\nAN IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS UNDER THE NAME OF CRASHOVERRIDE.\nTHIS MALWARE IS PROBABLY LINKED TO THE DECEMBER 2016 UKRAINE ATTACK. INDEED, THIS MALWARE HAS\nBEEN DESIGNED TO DISRUPT THE WORKING PROCESS OF INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS\nUSED IN ELECTRICAL SUBSTATIONS.\n\n\nBefore going deeper into the malware, let’s\nhave a look at embedded components. As we\ncan see in the schematic below, the malware\nembeds:\n\nTwo backdoors (C&C through HTTPS)\nA launcher\nA wiper\n\u0007Four differents payloads corresponding\nto four different industrial protocolsi\n\n\n**INDUSTROYER / CRASHOVERRIDE is the**\n**first OT malware designed specifically to**\n**attack electric grids.**\n\n**This malware supports four differents**\n**industrial protocols:**\n\n\u0007IEC 60870-5-101 (aka IEC 101)\nIEC 60870-5-104 (aka IEC 104)\nIEC 61850\nOLE for Process Control Data Access\n(OPC DA)\n\n\nIt is obvious that since the first 2015 attack\n(using Blackenergy and Killdisk) and this\nmalware, there is a huge gap and attackers\nhave **improved their capacities. The**\nmalware is now able **to control switches**\n**and breakers. ESET have seen indications**\nthat this malware could have been the tool\nused by attackers to cause the power outage\nin December 2016. **The infection vector**\n**remains unknown but the investigation is**\n**still ongoing.**\n\n|LAUN|CHER|\n|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\n**IEC 61850 PAYLOAD COMPONENT**\n\nThis payload uses the IEC 61850 standard. This\nstandard describes a protocol used for multi-vendor\ncommunication among devices that perform protection,\nautomation, metering, monitoring, and control of\nelectrical substation automation systems. The 61850\npayload uses only a small subset of the protocol to\nproduce its disruptive effect. The payload looks for a\nconfiguration file defining targets and commands as seen\npreviously. If the payload does not find the file, it starts to\nscan the network for TCP port 102 (used by IEC 61850).\nOnce found, the payload sends a connection request\npacket using the COTP protocol. If successful, it sends a\nInitiateRequest and a getNameList request to compile\na list of targets, variables and contents. Afterwards, the\npayload parses received data for variables that contain\nthe strings CSW (corresponds to logical nodes used to\ncontrol circuit breakers and switches). For each of them\nit will try a read and a write order to change the position\nof the breaker.\n\n\n-----\n\nON JUNE 27[TH], THE UKRAINIAN RADIO HOLOS STOLYTSY WERE\nABLE TO CONTINUE THE RADIO DIFFUSION USING\nAN ANALOG RADIO EMETOR: THEIR MAIN SERVER\nWAS INFECTED BY A MALWARE... NOTPETYA WAS BORN…\n\nStill in 2017, another massive attack has been performed against ukrainian critical infrastructure. Although the payload did not include\nexploits targeting industrial systems, it did significantly impact manufacturing plants, as well in Ukraine as world-wide, with 6-figure losses\nat several european corporations.\n\nWhat happened: on June 27[th], the main server of the Ukrainian radio Holos Stolytsy was infected by a malware. The radio was only able to\ncontinue the diffusion using an analog radio emetor. This was “NotPetya”’s first strike! Soon after this first detection, other infections were\nquickly detected around the world. But NotPetya is not Petya: let’s not mix the original 2016 Petya ransomware and the one we are talking\nabout, which is not a ransomware, and therefore was named “NotPetya”.\n\nBasically, a ransomware is a malware that prevents file usage (e.g. using encryption) and requests a ransom to decrypt them. Petya is a\nransomware published in March 2016. The one which started in June 27[th] is quite different although based on the ransomware Petya.\nThe main difference is the fact that it is not a ransomware. Once NotPetya is executed on a platform, it encrypts the whole hard drive but\ndoes not exfiltrate or embed a method to decrypt stored data. It means that NotPetya’s authors were not interested in money.\n\nNotPetya embeds an effective infection method using the same exploits that Wannacry uses, targetting Windows SMB. Unlike Wannacry,\nNotPetya tries to exploit remote machines located on the same local network. But the main point is **NotPetya has functionalities to**\n**retrieve and exfiltrate passwords and some remote administration functionalities.**\n\nWe can directly conclude that NotPetya was not designed to make money or to control a BotNet but instead to infect a precise target. The\ninitial infection vector came from a malicious update of the Ukrainian countability software M.E.Doc. Indeed, hackers took the control of a\nM.E.Doc’s server update and infected an update with NotPetya.\n\n**This Ukrainian radio was not an isolated case. In fact, lots of Ukrainian institutions and companies have also been infected and, since**\nNotPetya continued to spread itself through SMB, the infection rate was quite high. Several French companies, like Saint Gobain, have also\nbeen infected. As for previous attacks using the same vulnerability (Wannacry for instance), industrial systems were impacted, because of\neither direct network connections between IT and OT domains, or laptops or other equipments connected to both domains.\n\nDetermining the goal or attributing the malware to a country is quite hard. Russian Rosneft also has been impacted. The Ukrainian\nCyber Police officially confirmed that M.E.Doc servers were backdoored on three different occasions. The total losses, due to the alleged\nnegligence of Intellect-Service, might be in the range of $1bn considering that St Gobain alone has declared a loss of $250M in revenue.\n\n\n-----\n\n**2015 INCIDENT**\n\n\u0007Ukraine's state security service SBU has\nblamed Russia but the nation's energy\nministry said it would hold off on\nattribution until after it finishes a formal\n**probe.**\n\n\u0007A press statement on the SBU website\nalleged the discovery of malicious\nsoftware responsible for these outages on\nthe networks of regional power companies.\nAccording to the SBU press statement,\nthe cyberattack was accompanied **by a**\n**barrage of phone calls to their technical**\n**support telephone numbers which would**\n**have acted like a denial of service (DoS)**\n**attack.**\n\n\u0007The U.S. cyber intelligence firm iSight\nPartners said it has determined that\na Russian hacking group known as\n**Sandworm caused this unprecedented**\npower outage in Ukraine. Many other\nUS based companies are pointing to\nSandworm as the “hacking” unit.\n\n\u0007Some press organizations are claiming\nthis is the first known Grid hack. They\nshould remember, even unconfirmed, that\nthe 2003 blackout in the US east coast\n\n**2016 INCIDENT**\n\n**Several assumptions have been released**\n**since this second outage. For the time being,**\ntechnical details regarding the attack have\nnot been published. The only “technical”\nfinding is the threat vector. Indeed, the\nSCADA stations had been compromised by\nan **external source. Marina Krotofil, lead**\ncyber-security researcher at Honeywell who\nassisted in the investigation, declared “It was\nan intentional cyber incident not meant to be\non a large scale... they actually attacked more\nbut couldn’t achieve all their goals”. Also from\nMarina Krotofil, “hackers are thought to have\nhidden in Ukrenergo’s IT network undetected\nfor six months, acquiring privileges to access\nsystems and figure out their workings, before\ntaking methodical steps to take the power\n\n\nmay have been caused by a cyberattack.\nAlso, the FBI has already claimed that\nDaesh has tried unsuccessfully to hack\n**the national US power grid.**\n\n\u0007According to the SANS ICS blog, the\nattack was a coordinated effort which\ntargeted several power sub-companies\nand included a flooding attack on their\nphone support systems to prevent\nlegitimate customers from reporting a\npower cut which would alert the on-call\npersonnel to the problem. According to\nthe same source (unconfirmed), the staff\nin the affected companies **acted quickly**\n**to bypass the SCADA systems and run**\n**everything in manual mode by acting on**\n**the main breakers which restored service**\nin under 6 hours. This would not have been\npossible in a modern grid installation\nwhich relies heavily on automation and\ncan’t be run in “manual mode”.\n\n\u0007A Ukrainian telecoms engineer has raised\ndoubts about the widely reported link\nbetween BlackEnergy attacks and power\noutages in his country. Named Illia Illin,\nper “The Register” article, he claims “First\n\noffline”. So far, we have no information\nconfirming that the techniques used are the\nsame or not.\n\nAccording to CyberX, the malware used\nduring the BugDrop operation detailed in the\nfacts section **could have been used during**\n**the reconnaissance phase. Indeed, the**\ncompilation date and some targets may lead\nto this conclusion. The malware was compiled\nseveral times between June 2016 and end of\n**October 2016. Concerning identified targets**\nhere is the list:\n\n\u0007A company that designs remote\n**monitoring systems for oil & gas**\n**pipeline infrastructures.**\n\u0007An international organization that\n\n\nof all, there weren't any blackouts in\nBoryspil (KBP)”.\n\n\u0007An investigation team led by US\ngovernment officials has released a\nreport as part of the ICS-CERT initiative\n(see sources section). This report remains\nvague about the exact insertion methods\nand attacker techniques and focuses\non proactive defenses that would have\nprevented the attack. Also, in the current\npolitical context, it’s hard to imagine that\ninterviews of Ukrainian operators by US\ngovernment officials would be **100%**\n**factual and accurate.**\n\n\u0007SANS ICS has released a new detailed\nreport which summarizes the information\ncollected by the investigation team\n(see sources for “DUC5”). The report\nuses the Cyber Kill Chain framework to\ncharacterize the different phases of the\nattack. However, many technical details\nremain vague (especially concerning\nattacker reconnaissance and remote\ncontrol by VPN). An analysis of the alleged\nmalware used is provided. **The RAT tool**\n**used by the attacker is not mentioned.**\n\nmonitors human rights, counter-terrorism\nand cyberattacks on critical infrastructure\nin the Ukraine.\n\u0007An engineering company that designs\nelectrical substations, gas distribution\npipelines, and water supply plants.\n\u0007A scientific research institute.\n\u0007Editors of Ukrainian newspapers.\n\nThe assumption linking this malware and\nthe attack is based on these targets mainly\n**located in Ukraine and linked to energy but**\nalso due to techniques used like the reflective\nDLL injection (loading malicious code without\ncalling the normal Windows API calls) which\nwas used during the first attack. Another hint\ncomes from the compilation time.\n\n\n-----\n\nSENTRYO ICS CYBERVISION OFFERS AN OT MONITORING SOLUTION THAT\nPROVIDES AN OPERATIONAL CAPACITY TO PREVENT, DETECT\nAND RESPOND TO CYBERATTACKS.\n\n\nICS CyberVision continuously listen communications between\ndevices on the OT network and extract meaningful data. Those\ndata are then used to create a behavorial «template» of the OT\nnetwork which is then used as a white list to detect anomalies.\nICS CyberVision use IA algorithms to caracterise and prioritize\nthose anomalies in order to eliminate false positive and facilitate\nthe remediation process. In addition scripts from Sentryo Security\nLabs are provided to ICS CyberVision users. These scripts use the\nCyberVision Center API to mine their CyberVision installations to\ncheck for some Indicators of Compromise (IOC).\n\nIn the case of organization is in the energy sector and may have\nbeen targeted by this new Black Energy campaign or the latest\nGrizzly Steppe (see the DHS report), we strongly encourage them\n**to run these scripts and check their ICS.**\n\n**Moreover, if ICS CyberVision had been deployed inside the process**\n**and control networks of an Energy corporation, it would have**\n**detected several weak signals enabling the local team to stop the**\n**attacks early:**\n\n\u0007Regarding Black Energy, ICS CyberVision would have detected\nunknown connections to **a remote Internet website (the C&C**\nchannels). These connections would have been seen as a change\ncompared to the baseline (a set of given network behaviors)\ndefined by plant operators.\n\n\u0007Regarding Industroyer/CrashOverride, ICS CyberVision would\nhave detected any new connections to a remote Internet website\n(the C&C channels), and also new and strange behaviours on\nthe OT networks like multiple OT network scans and critical OT\ncommunications like orders.\n\n\n\u0007Regarding the Disakil “wiper”, ICS CyberVision would have\ndetected the disappearance of TCP connections **between the**\n**SCADA stations and the PLCs / RTUs. The defined baseline**\nincludes these connections and the fact that they stopped being\nactive would have automatically been detected as a change by\n**the difference engine.**\n\n\u0007Regarding the breaker manipulation, ICS CyberVision would have\nanalysed IEC 101 (serial over ethernet) flows and detected the\norder to open up the breaker and to switch off power. CyberVision\nwould help **to trace down the hackers to particular infected**\n**machines.**\n\n\u0007Regarding the Siemens safety equipment DoS vulnerability\nused by Industroyer (CVE-2015-5374), it will be detected by ICS\n**Cybervision thanks to its Knowledge Database. Back in 2015,**\nSiemens provided a firmware update fixing this issue. It is even\nmore important today to patch these equipments. Our solution\ncan help by clearly identifying the potentially affected devices\nin the network.\n\nThe only vector which would have remained undetected by ICS\nCyberVision is the “dropper” i.e. an Excel spreadsheet or Word\ndocument in later case. It is the responsibility of an email gateway\nor an endpoint protection software to detect such attack vectors.\nThe malware could also have been inserted via a malicious USB\ndrive and only endpoint protection software can prevent these\nattacks.\n\nSince Stuxnet, the malware Industroyer / CrashOverride is the first\nadvanced and targeted industrial malware we have seen with this\n**level of maturity. From a defense point of view, this malware also**\nshows the need for an ICS network security monitoring capability\nto be able to detect these advanced attacks early in the kill chain.\n\n\n-----\n\nLet’s have look at the kill chain and the malware impact. This is important because investigations are still ongoing and some information\nmay have not been communicated. Because of this, Phase 1 and part of the Phase 2 are pure assumptions using our experience and\n**external claims:**\n\n|Col1|PREPARATION|\n|---|---|\n||PREPARATION 1 1.

In addition to the high level\nNational council a working level network\nfor timely sharing of threat information\nand lessons learned should be created\nfor dealing with immediate issues and\nfacilitating coordinated effective response\nin times of emergency. **In summary it is**\n**only through cooperation and sharing of**\n**information among a community of interest**\n**that an operator-defender can hope to**\n**deal with today's advanced and persistent**\n**threats emanating from cyberspace.**\n\n\n**Today’s cyber attacker is several steps**\n**ahead of the defender. This is especially**\nso in the case of a single operator trying\nto defend against a state resourced APT\nattacker. This is an unfair match, similar\nto a high-school soccer team’s chances\nof defeating a FIFA World Cup contender.\nIt is no contest unless the school team’s\ncapabilities are significantly enhanced. **It**\n**is important to realize that the operator-**\n**defender has a complex task of managing**\n**and protecting increasingly interconnected**\n**and sophisticated systems enabled with**\n**the latest advances in information and**\n**communications technologies (ITC).**\n\nTechnologies that in addition to providing\nnew features and possibilities for remote\nmanagement and control also introduce\nvulnerabilities for an adversary to exploit.\nThe operator now faces a difficult challenge\nin managing systems that are vulnerable to\nnot only intentional but also unintentional\ncyber incidents. Incidents that result from\nerrors in managing interconnected and\ncomplex systems. The attacker needs only\nto find a single weakness in the design or\nexposed vulnerability in order to defeat all\nthe wide-ranging efforts of the defender.\n\n\nIn order for the operator of critical\ninfrastructure to avoid becoming an isolated\ntarget for an adversary that often is several\nsteps ahead of the defender he must improve\nhis relationship among operators of critical\ninfrastructure, manufacturers, academia and\nGovernment institutions responsible for\ncybersecurity. The aim should be in setting\n**up a mechanism that will facilitate the**\n**timely sharing of information on cyber**\n**threats, coordinating a response to an**\n**incident and sharing lessons learned.**\nAt the local level, National cybersecurity\ncouncils that represent the communities\nof interest (CoI) should be created as a first\nstep in setting up a national cybersecurity\ncapacity for protecting critical infrastructure\nfrom these advanced and persistent threats\nfrom cyberspace.\n\nThis is not an easy task since fear of\nlawsuits, embarrassment and concerns for\nconfidentiality often make operators as\nwell as manufacturers of control equipment\nreluctant to share the information needed\nto enhance resilience and enhance recovery\ncapabilities. This lack of sharing can only\ncontribute to making defenders more\nisolated and less aware of the significance\n\n\n2 The views expressed by V Butrimas are for NATO NATO member countries NATO partners related private and public institutions and related individuals These views\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n###### FROM THE FOREWORD\n\n**Critical Infrastructure: “refers to assets of physical**\nand computer-based systems that are essential to the\nminimum operations of an economy and its government.\nThey include… telecommunications, energy, banking and\nfinance, transportation, water systems and emergency\nservices, both government and private.”\nhttp://www.infracritical.com/?page_id=73\n\n**Langner, R., To Kill a Centrifuge,**\nhttp://www.langner.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/\nTo- kill-a-centrifuge.pdf\n\n**Rashid, F., Inside The Aftermath Of The Saudi Aramco**\n**Breach, Dark Reading, 8/8/2015**\nhttp://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/inside-theaftermath-of-the- saudi-aramco-breach/d/d-id/1321676\n\n**Alert (ICS-ALERT-14-281-01E) Ongoing Sophisticated**\n**Malware Campaign Compromising ICS (Update E) US**\n**ICS-CERT**\nhttps://ics-cert.us- cert.gov/alerts/ICS-ALERT- 14-281- 01B\nOriginal release date: December 10, 2014\n\n**Sandworm and SCADA, Trend Micro**\nhttp://blog.trendmicro.com/sandworm-and-scada/ October\n16, 2014\n\n**The State of IT Security in Germany 2014, Federal IT**\n**Department (BSI) Germany. p. 31.**\nhttps://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/BSI/\nPublications/Securitysituation/IT-Security-Situation-inGermany- 2014.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=3\n\n###### FIRST INCIDENT REPORTS\n\nhttp://www.oe.if.ua/showarticle.php?id=3413\n\nhttp://briz.if.ua/33432.htm\n\n###### SECOND INCIDENT REPORTS\n\nhttp://www.ukrenergo.energy.gov.ua/pages/en/detailsnew.\naspx?nid=3387\n\nhttp://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-cyber-attackenergy-idUSKBN1521BA\n\n###### INTECH / ISA ANALYSIS\n\n**InTech, March/April 2017 issue, special section**\n**«Cybersecurity», a publication of the International**\n**Society of Automation**\nwwww.isa.org/intech\n\n###### DETAILED ANALYSIS\n\nhttp://www.welivesecurity.com/2016/01/03/blackenergysshbeardoor-details-2015-attacks-ukrainian-news-mediaelectric-industry/\n\n\nhttp://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/destructivedisakil-malware-linked-ukraine-power-outages-also-usedagainst-media-organizations\n\nhttp://www.welivesecurity.com/2016/01/20/new-waveattacks-ukrainian-power-industry/\n\nhttps://securelist.com/blog/research/73440/blackenergyapt-attacks-in-ukraine-employ-spearphishing-with-worddocuments/\n\nhttps://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/\nuploads/2016/01/BlackEnergy3_WP_012716_1c.pdf\n\nhttps://ics.sans.org/blog/2016/01/09/confirmation-of-acoordinated-attack-on-the-ukrainian-power-grid\n\nhttps://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/alerts/IR-ALERT-H-16-056-01\n\nhttps://ics.sans.org/duc5\n\nhttp://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-cyber-attackenergy-idUSKBN1521BA\n\nhttps://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/there-willalways-be-internet-outages-so-buckle-up\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTwsDLO3C44\n\nhttps://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/who-hackedthe-lights-in-ukraine\n\n###### CLAIMS\n\nhttp://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/01/27/ukraine_\nblackenergy_analysis/\n\nhttps://cyberx-labs.com/en/blog/operation-bugdropcyberx-discovers-large-scale-cyber-reconnaissanceoperation/\n\nhttp://in.reuters.com/article/ukraine-crisis-cyber-attacksidINKBN1491QI\n\n###### IOC\n\nhttp://cert.gov.ua/?p=2464\n\n###### GCAT C&C CONTROL USING GMAIL\n\nhttps://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/gcat\n\n###### NATO CCD COA\n\nhttps://ccdcoe.org/multimedia/cyber-war-perspectiverussian-aggression-against-ukraine.html\n\n###### GRIZZLY STEPPE DHS\n\nhttps://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/publications/\nJAR_16-20296A_GRIZZLY%20STEPPE-2016-1229.pdf\n\n\n-----\n\n###### BLACKHAT 2016 TALK\n\n**Author: Geers “Cyber War In Perspective Analysis From The**\nCrisis In Ukraine”\n\nMarina Krotofil at s4x17 Miam introducing the attack and the\ntalk from Oleskii Yasinskiy:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTwsDLO3C44\n\nOleskii Yasinskiy from http://www.issp.ua/\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uPvps3l1Yc\n\n###### VSEVOLOD KOVALCHUK’S FACEBOOK STATEMENT FOLLOWING THE SECOND ATTACK\n\n ICS-CERT ALERT (TA17-163A) CRASHOVERRIDE MALWARE\n\nhttps://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA17-163A\n\n###### THE COMPLETE ESET REPORT\n\nhttps://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/06/12/industroyerbiggest-threat-industrial-control-systems-since-stuxnet/\n\n###### THE DRAGOS REPORT\n\nhttps://dragos.com/blog/crashoverride/CrashOverride-01.pdf\n\nOther sources are confidential.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----",
