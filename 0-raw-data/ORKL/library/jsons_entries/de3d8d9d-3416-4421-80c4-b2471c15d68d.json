Analysis of this piece of malware gives an interesting insight into the current state of\nmalware development.\n\nThe malware is delivered through a malicious Microsoft Office document, likely sent via\nemail, which is a common way for both targeted and opportunistic malware to infect\ndevices. The authors appear to have uploaded early versions of the malicious document to\n_VirusTotal, to measure the detection of their code by a range of anti-virus products._\n\nIn general, using VirusTotal in this way gives a malware author only limited insight into\nwhether a piece of malware will be blocked: VirusTotal uses static anti-virus scanners and\nthus uploading a malicious file to the service can only help its author understand whether it\nwill be detected as malicious, not whether the malware will actually be allowed to run. On\ntop of a static detection engine, endpoint security software typically includes various layers\nof protection that aim to prevent both known and unknown malware from running.\n\nFor a malicious document, however, static detection is important in determining whether it\nwill bypass an email security product; if the file is not detected, it is more likely to be able to\nbypass such security measures – especially if the document is sent only in small quantities,\nthus not triggering anti-spam detectors in such products.\n\nIf the file is opened, and if macros are enabled by the user, the actual payload will be\ndownloaded.\n\nThe GravityRAT Remote Access Trojan (or Tool) is noteworthy for the fact that is uses no\nfewer than seven techniques to detect whether it is running inside a virtual machine.\n\nA lot of today's malware is 'VM-aware', and when it detects that it is being run inside a\nvirtual machine (and is thus likely to be being analysed by a human or a malware-detection\nsandbox), it either terminates or changes its behaviour. Common techniques for detecting a\nvirtual machine environment include looking for traces of the hypervisor left on the virtual\nmachine, checking the computer name, and checking the number of CPU cores – all of\nwhich GravityRAT does.\n\n\n-----\n\nBut it also uses a novel technique where it requests the CPU temperature – a feature not\ncommonly supported by hypervisors. These will then respond 'not supported', thus\nrevealing that the malware is probably not being run on a real machine.\n\nFor many years, there has been a continuous cat-and-mouse (cat-and-rat?) game between\nmalware writers and the developers of virtual machines and sandboxes. Analyses like this\nhelp the latter update their tools and thus force the malware authors to work even harder.\n\n[Warren and Paul spoke at VB2017 last year and will be back at VB2018 in Montreal, to](https://www.virusbulletin.com/conference/vb2017/abstracts/modern-reconnaissance-phase-apt-protection-layer/)\n[discuss the 'Olympic Destroyer' malware.
