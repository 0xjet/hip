The company is a global technology vendor with significant\ngovernment business in the US, Australia, UK, and recently opened offices in China. Our\nthreat hunt produced several key findings important to the long-term security of their\n\n\n-----\n\nnetwork, however, one key finding stood out as potentially impacting countless other\nbusinesses who currently operate in China.

This report identifies a new threat and provides specific\nhunting, investigative, and remediation methodologies that can be used to help ensure\nyour environment is clean.\n\n[Download Now](https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/library/documents/the-golden-tax-department-and-the-emergence-of-goldenspy-malware/?utm_source=sl-blog&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=goldenspy)\n\n### Investigation Details\n\n\n-----\n\nWe identified an executable file displaying highly unusual behavior and sending system\ninformation to a suspicious Chinese domain. Discussions with our client revealed that this\nwas part of their bank’s required tax software. They informed us that upon opening\noperations in China, their local Chinese bank required that they install a software package\ncalled Intelligent Tax produced by the Golden Tax Department of Aisino Corporation, for\npaying local taxes.\n\nAs we continued our investigation into the tax software, we found that it worked as\nadvertised, but it also installed a hidden backdoor on the system that enabled a remote\nadversary to execute Windows commands or to upload and execute any binary (to include\nransomware, trojans, or other malware). Basically, it was a wide-open door into the network\nwith SYSTEM level privileges and connected to a command and control server completely\nseparate from the tax software’s network infrastructure. Based on this, and several other\nfactors (described below) we determined this file to have sufficient characteristics to be\nmalware. We’ve since fully reverse-engineered the files and named the family GoldenSpy.\n\nGoldenSpy was digitally signed by a company called Chenkuo Network Technology and the\nsignature used identical text for both the product and description fields; 认证软件版本升级服\n务 – which translates to “certified software version upgrade service”. This name may sound\nlike legitimate software, however, in this situation the tax software already has its own\nupdater service that functions well, and in a way completely unrelated to GoldenSpy.\n\nThere were several other unusual aspects of this file, to include:\n\nGoldenSpy installs two identical versions of itself, both as persistent autostart\nservices. If either stops running, it will respawn its counterpart. Furthermore, it utilizes\nan exeprotector module that monitors for the deletion of either iteration of itself. If\ndeleted, it will download and execute a new version. Effectively, this triple-layer\nprotection makes it exceedingly difficult to remove this file from an infected system.\nThe Intelligent Tax software’s uninstall feature will not uninstall GoldenSpy. It leaves\nGoldenSpy running as an open backdoor into the environment, even after the tax\nsoftware is fully removed.\nGoldenSpy is not downloaded and installed until a full two hours after the tax software\ninstallation process is completed. When it finally downloads and installs, it does so\nsilently, with no notification on the system. This long delay is highly unusual and a\nmethod to hide from the victim’s notice.\nGoldenSpy does not contact the tax software’s network infrastructure (i-xinnuo[.]com),\nrather it reaches out to ningzhidata[.]com, a domain known to host other variations of\nGoldenSpy malware. After the first three attempts to contact its command and control\nserver, it randomizes beacon times. This is a known method to avoid network security\ntechnologies designed to identify beaconing malware.\n\n\n-----\n\nGoldenSpy operates with SYSTEM level privileges, making it highly dangerous and\ncapable of executing any software on the system. This includes additional malware or\nWindows administrative tools to conduct reconnaissance, create new users, escalate\nprivileges, etc.\n\nThese factors have led us to the conclusion that GoldenSpy is a well-hidden and powerful\nbackdoor that surrenders full remote command and control of the victim system to an\nunknown adversary.\n\nThe diagram below shows the network communication patterns of GoldenSpy installation\nvia Intelligent Tax software.\n\nThe scope of this campaign is not currently known. For our client, GoldenSpy was secretly\nembedded within the Aisino Intelligent tax software, but we cannot determine if this was\ntargeted because of their access to vital data, or if this campaign impacts every company\ndoing business in China. We have identified similar activity at a global financial institution,\nbut do not yet have further telemetry into this campaign.\n\nThe current GoldenSpy campaign began in April of 2020, however, our cyber threat intel\nanalysts have discovered variations of GoldenSpy that date back to December of 2016. It is\nof interest that Chenkuo Technology’s website announced a partnership with Aisino in\nOctober of 2016, two months prior to the original emergence of the GoldenSpy malware\nfamily. Their partnership is for “big data cooperation”. GoldenSpy certainly could enable big\n\n\n-----\n\ndata access and collection. Trustwave SpiderLabs has no current knowledge if GoldenSpy\nwas active in the wild since 2016, our first identification of usage was April 2020. To be\nclear, we do not yet know the scope, purpose, or actors behind the threat. We do not know\nwhether Chenkuo Technology or Aisino are active and/or willing participants or the extent of\ntheir involvement other than what is presented in the report.\n\n### Recommendations\n\nWe believe that every corporation operating in China or using the Aisino Intelligent Tax\nSoftware should consider this incident a potential threat and should engage in threat\nhunting, containment, and remediation countermeasures, as outlined in our technical report\n(download link below).\n\nTrustwave SpiderLabs is still actively investigating and seeking out more telemetry on the\nGoldenSpy campaign. If you have any information about this activity or feel you may have\nbeen victimized by this attack, please reach out to the Trustwave SpiderLabs Threat Fusion\nTeam at _[GoldenSpy@trustwave.com.](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:GoldenSpy@trustwave.com)_\n\nWe are available for advice, information exchange, or to engage threat hunting / forensic\ninvestigation services.\n\n### GoldenSpy Technical Report\n\nTrustwave has prepared a detailed technical report on GoldenSpy that contains:\n\nFull incident details, including network and file system indicators of compromise\n(IOC’s)\n\n\n-----\n\nMalware reverse engineering analysis reports\nHistorical network IOC’s and known GoldenSpy variants\nGoldenSpy threat hunting recommendations, including a custom YARA signature\ndesigned to identify unknown GoldenSpy variants\nRemediation recommendations\n\n[Download Now](https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/library/documents/the-golden-tax-department-and-the-emergence-of-goldenspy-malware/?utm_source=sl-blog&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=goldenspy)\n\nAisino Corporation and Nanjing Chenkuo Network Technology were contacted and briefed\non these findings, as part of Trustwave's documented vulnerability disclosure process.
