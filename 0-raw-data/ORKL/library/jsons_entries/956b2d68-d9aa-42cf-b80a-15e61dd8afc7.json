We call this activity group RASPITE.\n\n\n-----\n\nAnalysis of RASPITE tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) indicate the group has\nbeen active in some form since early- to mid-2017. RASPITE targeting includes entities in\nthe US, Middle East, Europe, and East Asia. Operations against electric utility organizations\nappear limited to the US at this time.\n\nRASPITE leverages strategic website compromise to gain initial access to target networks.\nRASPITE uses the same methodology as DYMALLOY and ALLANITE in embedding a link\nto a resource to prompt an SMB connection, from which it harvests Windows credentials.\nThe group then deploys install scripts for a malicious service to beacon back to RASPITEcontrolled infrastructure, allowing the adversary to remotely access the victim machine.\n\nRASPITE overlaps significantly with Symantec’s LEAFMINER, which recently released a\nreport on the group’s activity in the Middle East.\n\nRASPITE’s activity to date currently focuses on initial access operations within the electric\nutility sector. Although focused on ICS-operating entities, RASPITE has not demonstrated\nan ICS-specific capability to date. This means that the activity group is targeting electric\nutilities, but there is no current indication the group has the capability of destructive ICS\nattacks including widespread blackouts like those in Ukraine.\n\nWhile the group has not yet demonstrated an ICS capability, RASPITE’s recent targeting\nfocus and methodology are clear indicators of necessary activity for initial intrusion\noperations into an IT network to prepare the way for later potential ICS events.\n\n_Dragos threat intelligence leverages the Dragos Platform, our threat operations center, and_\n_other sources to provide comprehensive insight into threats affecting industrial control_\n_security and safety worldwide. Dragos does not corroborate nor conduct political attribution_\n_to threat activity. Dragos instead focuses on threat behaviors and appropriate detection and_\n_response._ _[Read more about Dragos’ approach to categorizing threat activity and attribution.](https://www.dragos.com/blog/industry-news/threat-analytics-and-activity-groups/)_\n\n_Dragos does not publicly describe ICS activity group technical details except in_\n_extraordinary circumstances in order to limit tradecraft proliferation. However, full details on_\n_RASPITE and other group tools, techniques, procedures, and infrastructure is available to_\n_[network defenders via Dragos WorldView.](https://www.dragos.com/worldview)_\n\n### Contact Us For a Demo\n\n[Contact Us](https://dragos.com/contact)\n\n\n-----",
