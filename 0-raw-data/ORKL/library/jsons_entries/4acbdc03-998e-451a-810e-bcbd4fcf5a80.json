However,\nevidence suggests that it has been in development since February. The Black Basta\noperator(s) use the double extortion technique, meaning that in addition to encrypting files on\nthe systems of targeted organizations and demanding ransom to make decryption possible,\nthey also maintain a dark web leak site where they threaten to post sensitive information if an\norganization chooses not to pay ransom.\n\n\n-----\n\nBlack Basta affiliates have been very active deploying Black Basta and extorting\norganizations since the ransomware first emerged. Although the Black Basta affiliates have\nonly been active for the past couple of months, based on the information posted on their leak\nsite, they have compromised over 75 organizations at the time of this publication. Unit 42 has\nalso worked on several Black Basta incident response cases.\n\nThe ransomware is written in C++ and impacts both Windows and Linux operating systems.\nIt encrypts users’ data using a combination of ChaCha20 and RSA-4096, and to speed up\nthe encryption process, the ransomware encrypts in chunks of 64 bytes, with 128 bytes of\ndata remaining unencrypted between the encrypted regions. The faster the ransomware\nencrypts, the more systems can potentially be compromised before defenses are triggered. It\nis a key factor affiliates look for when joining a Ransomware-as-a-Service group.\n\nPalo Alto Networks customers receive help with detection and prevention of Black Basta\n[ransomware through the following products and services: Cortex XDR and](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cortex/cortex-xdr) Next-Generation\n[Firewalls (including cloud-delivered security services such as](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/security-subscriptions) [WildFire).](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/next-generation-firewall)\n\nIf you think you may have been impacted by a cyber incident, the Unit 42 Incident Response\nteam is available 24/7/365.

The attackers not only execute ransomware but also exfiltrate sensitive data and\nthreaten to release it publicly if the ransom demands are not met. The threat actors behind\nthe ransomware deploy a name-and-shame approach to their victim, where they use a Tor\nsite, Basta News, to list all of the victims who have not paid the ransom.\n\n\n-----\n\nAlthough the Black Basta RaaS has only been active for a couple of months, according to its\nleak site, it had compromised over 75 organizations at the time of this publication. At least 20\nvictims were posted to its leak site in the first two weeks of the ransomware’s operation,\nwhich indicates the group likely is experienced in the ransomware business and has a steady\nsource of initial access.\n\nIt is also possible that this is not a new operation but rather a rebrand of a previous\nransomware group that brought along their affiliates. Based on multiple similarities in tactics,\ntechniques and procedures (TTPs) - victim-shaming blogs, recovery portals, negotiation\ntactics, and how quickly Black Basta amassed its victims - that the Black Basta group could\ninclude current or former members of the Conti group.\n\nUnit 42 has observed ​​the Black Basta ransomware group using QBot as an initial point of\n[entry and to move laterally in compromised networks. QBot, also known as Qakbot, is a](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/tutorial-qakbot-infection/)\nWindows malware strain that started as a banking trojan and evolved into a malware\ndropper. It has been used by other ransomware groups, including MegaCortex, ProLock,\n[DoppelPaymer and](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/ransomware-threat-assessments/4/) [Egregor. While these ransomware groups used QBot for initial access,](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/egregor-ransomware-courses-of-action/)\nthe Black Basta group was observed using it for both initial access and to spread laterally\nthroughout the network.\n\nFigure 1 below shows the standard attack lifecycle observed with Black Basta ransomware.\n\nFigure 1. Black Basta attack lifecycle based on Unit 42 incident response cases.\n\n## Technical Details\n\nBlack Basta is written in C++ and is cross-platform ransomware that impacts both Windows\nand Linux systems. In June 2022, a VMware ESXi variant of Black Basta was observed\ntargeting virtual machines running on enterprise Linux servers.\n\nThe ransomware includes anti-analysis techniques that attempt to detect code emulation or\nsandboxing to avoid virtual/analysis machine environments. It also supports the command\nline argument -forcepath that is used to encrypt files in a specified directory. Otherwise, the\nentire system, except for certain critical directories, is encrypted.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe ransomware spawns a mutex with a string of dsajdhas.0 to ensure a single instance of\nthe malware is running at a time. Then it will iterate through the entire file system, encrypting\nfiles with a file extension of .basta.\n\nBlack Basta ransomware encrypts users’ data through a combination of ChaCha20 and\nRSA-4096. To speed up the encryption process, the ransomware encrypts in chunks of 64\nbytes, with 128 bytes of data remaining unencrypted between the encrypted regions. The\nransomware also attempts to delete shadow copies and other backups of files using\n[vssadmin.exe, a command-line tool that manages Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS),](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/vssadmin)\nwhich captures and copies stable images for backups on running systems.\n\nIt writes the Random-letters.ico and Random-letters.jpg files to the %TEMP% directory. The\n.jpg file is leveraged to overwrite the desktop background and appears as follows:\n\nFigure 2. Black Basta desktop wallpaper.\nIt adds a custom icon to the registry, corresponding to the .basta icon, which is shown in\nFigure 3.\n\nFigure 3. Black Basta icon.\n\nIt will then boot the system in safe mode and proceed to encrypt files. Following successful\nencryption, the file’s extension is changed to .basta and the ransomware will write numerous\ninstances of readme.txt, which contains the following ransom note:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4.

Tactics, techniques and procedures for Black Basta activity._\n\n## Victimology\n\nThe ransomware group and its affiliate program reportedly compromised multiple large\norganizations, in sectors including consumer and industrial products; energy, resources and\nagriculture; manufacturing; utilities; transportation; government agencies; professional\nservices and consulting; and real estate.\n\nBlack Basta operators also posted on dark web forums expressing interest in attacking\norganizations based in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the U.K. and the U.S. Threat actors\nusing the ransomware impacted organizations based in the U.S., Germany, Switzerland,\nItaly, France and the Netherlands (listed in descending order by numbers of allegedly\nbreached organizations).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5. Black Basta post on dark web forums.\nThe threat actor(s) responsible for Black Basta operate a cybercrime marketplace and victim\nname-and-shame blog. This site is hosted as a Tor hidden service, where the Black Basta\nransomware group lists their victims’ names, descriptions, percentage of stolen data which\nhas been published, number of visits and any data exfiltrated. There were 75 victims listed\non the leak site at the time of writing.\n\nFigure 6.
