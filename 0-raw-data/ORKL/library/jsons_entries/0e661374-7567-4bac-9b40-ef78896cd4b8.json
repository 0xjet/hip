    "plain_text": "# Nuclear missile contractor hacked in Maze ransomware attack\n\n**[nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2020/06/04/nuclear-missile-contractor-hacked-in-maze-ransomware-attack/](https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2020/06/04/nuclear-missile-contractor-hacked-in-maze-ransomware-attack/)**\n\nBy Lisa Vaas 04 Jun 2020\n\nThe US is protected by what’s known as a nuclear triad: a three-pronged attack force that\nconsists of land-launched nuclear missiles, nuclear missiles on submarines, and aircraft\nequipped with nuclear bombs and missiles.\n\nOne of the triad’s legs – the land-based LGM-30 Minuteman intercontinental ballistic missile\n(ICBM) – has been kicked by hackers who’ve inflicted Maze ransomware on the computer\nnetwork of a Northrup Grumman contractor.\n\n[Sky News reported on Wednesday that the contractor, Westech International, has confirmed](https://news.sky.com/story/hackers-steal-secrets-from-us-nuclear-missile-contractor-11999442)\nthat it’s been hacked and that its computers have been encrypted. It’s not yet clear if the\nextortionists managed to steal classified military information. Investigations to identify exactly\nwhat they got away with are still ongoing.\n\nHowever, the attackers have already leaked files that suggest they had access to sensitive\ndata – including payroll and emails – that they copied before they encrypted it, Sky News\nreports. They’re threatening to publish all of the files.\n\nUnauthorized access to data about intercontinental ballistic nuclear missiles would be bad\nenough, but depending on what the attackers accessed, the attack could have yet more\nserious repercussions, given Westech’s client list.\n\n\n-----\n\nThat list includes US military branches, government infrastructure agencies, and major\nmilitary contractors, including the Army, the Air Force, the Navy, Joint Service Agencies, the\nCommerce Department, the Energy Department, the General Services Administration, Booz\nAllen Hamilton, General Dynamics Information Technology, Lockheed Martin Information\nTechnology, and more.\n\n## Minuteman III missiles\n\nMinuteman III missiles are stored in hundreds of protected underground launch facilities\noperated by the Air Force Global Strike Command. Westech reportedly provides Northrup\nGrumman with engineering and maintenance support for the missiles.\n\nEach ICBM contains multiple thermonuclear warheads that can be delivered further than\n6,000 miles: roughly, about [one-fourth of the planet’s circumference or, as Sky News notes,](https://www.universetoday.com/66515/how-many-miles-around-the-earth/)\nthe distance between London and Buenos Aires. They can hit speeds of up to Mach 23:\nthat’s 17,508 miles/28,176 kilometers per hour.\n\nThe time frame of the attack, extortion demands and publishing of Westech’s sensitive data\nhaven’t been disclosed. The firm told Sky News that it immediately initiated an investigation\nand contained its systems after learning about the hack. It’s also working with an\nindependent computer forensic firm to “analyze its systems for any compromise and to\ndetermine if any personal information is at risk.”\n\nNorthrup Grumman and the Department of Defense (DoD) reportedly declined to comment.\n\n## About Maze\n\n[Maze ransomware is a new-ish ransomware strain that’s also been used recently against](https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2020/05/12/maze-ransomware-one-year-on-a-sophoslabs-report/)\n[Cognizant, a large US IT services company that disclosed that it had fallen victim in April.](https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2020/04/20/maze-ransomware-hits-us-giant-cognizant/)\n\nWestech International is just the latest in a string of Maze attacks. As SophosLabs described\nlast month in a report – titled Maze ransomware: extorting victims for 1 year and\n**counting – Maze has been in the news quite frequently recently, notably because the gang**\nwho created it have been in the vanguard of a new wave of “double-whammy” ransomware\nattacks.\n\nHere’s how it works, [according to Naked Security’s Paul Ducklin: The crooks confront you](https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2020/05/12/maze-ransomware-one-year-on-a-sophoslabs-report/)\nwith not one but two reasons to pay the extortion money:\n\n**Pay up to get the decryption key to recover your precious files, which we**\nscrambled with the malware.\n**Pay up to stop us releasing your precious files, which we took copies of before we**\nscrambled them.\n\n\n-----\n\nWestech s saga is in keeping with how Maze operators work: they follow through on threats\nof public exposure of stolen data by posting it in public data dumps – what are also known as\n[name-and-shame sites. If no payment is forthcoming, they’ll offer it up on cybercrime forums.](https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/maze-relaunches-name-and-shame/)\nFrom the SophosLabs report:\n\nThe Maze gang has made public exposure central to their ‘brand’ identity, and actively\nseeks attention from press and researchers to promote their brand—and make it easy\nfor victims who might hesitate to pay them to find out their reputation.\n\n“Brand identity?” Oh, yes, in all its animated glory. The ransomware has been around for\nmore than a year, though it was originally known simply as ChaCha, after the encryption\nalgorithm it used. In May 2019, its criminal operators adopted its current name, Maze, and\nhave come up with their own visual branding:\n\nHow the Maze virus greets victims on its website.\nI checked in with Westech International on Wednesday to see how it’s doing with its\nrecovery, whether there’s any update on its investigation, and what the contractor’s thinking\nmight be vis-a-vis paying the ransom – a sum that hasn’t been disclosed. I’ll update this\narticle if I hear back.\n\n## Pay or pray?\n\n\n-----\n\nThe answer, in a nutshell, is Please Don t Pay. There are very good reasons not to.\n\nAccording to the [State of Ransomware 2020 global study conducted earlier this year on](https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2020/05/12/huge-toll-of-ransomware-attacks-revealed-in-sophos-report/)\nSophos’s behalf, paying ransoms costs more than reinstating data using backups.\n\nYou might well ask how that could be, given that downtime is often cited as the most\nexpensive part of a ransomware attack. The rationale is simply that the cost of recovery is\nalways high, coming in at an average of $732,000. Paying the ransom on top of that simply\ndoubles the bill.\n\nAs noted by Naked Security’s John E. Dunn, this explains why extortionists almost always\nsend back encryption keys when paid: if they didn’t, then victims’ doubt would “quickly\ndestroy the whole extortion racket as companies knuckled down to do the hard work\nthemselves.”\n\nThat could explain why ransomware attackers are increasingly threatening to leak sensitive\ndata stolen during the attack, as was done in the Westech incident: the threat is an added\nincentive to pay up.\n\n## What to do?\n\nOrganizations shouldn’t despair. There are ways to limit the effect of ransomware attacks.\nThe first step: assume that an attack is inevitable, and prepare for it.\n\nOur advice:\n\nMake and test a backup plan, including storing data offsite where attackers can’t\nlocate it.\n**If you’re buying cyber-insurance, make sure it covers ransomware.**\nDon’t forget to protect data in the cloud as well as central data.\n**Use dedicated anti-ransomware protection. Twenty-four percent of survey**\nrespondents that were hit by ransomware were able to stop the attack before the data\ncould be encrypted.\n**Lock down Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). Criminal gangs exploit weak RDP**\ncredentials to launch targeted ransomware attacks. Turn off RDP if you don’t need it,\nand use rate limiting, two-factor authentication (2FA) or a virtual private network (VPN)\nif you do.\n**Pick strong passwords and use multi-factor authentication (MFA) as often as**\n**possible. And** [don’t re-use passwords, ever.](https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2014/09/23/is-it-really-such-a-bad-idea-to-use-a-password-twice/)\n**[Patch early, patch often. Ransomware like WannaCry and](https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2017/05/17/wannacry-the-ransomware-worm-that-didnt-arrive-on-a-phishing-hook/)** [NotPetya relied on](https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2017/06/28/new-petya-ransomware-all-you-wanted-to-know-but-were-afraid-to-ask/)\nunpatched vulnerabilities to spread around the globe.\n\n[It’s also worth reading Naked Security’s advice on common mistakes that make ransomware](https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2020/04/27/5-common-mistakes-that-lead-to-ransomware/)\neasier to pull off from the attacker’s point of view.
