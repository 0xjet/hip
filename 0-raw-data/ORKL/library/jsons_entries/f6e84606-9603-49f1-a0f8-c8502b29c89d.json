Since first emerging in May 2020, the ransomware operators (aka. the Conti Gang)](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.conti)\nclaim more than 150 successful attacks, which equates to millions of dollars in extortion fees.\n\n[Like other ransomware syndicates that have emerged recently, the Conti gang follows the growing trend of double extortion: they steal](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/cybereason-vs.-conti-ransomware)\nsensitive files and information from their victims and later use it to extort their victims by threatening to publish the data unless the ransom is\npaid\n\n\n-----\n\n### ey eta s\n\n**Emerging Threat: In a short amount of time, Conti ransomware has caused a great deal of damage and made headlines across the world.**\n\n**High Severity: The Cybereason Nocturnus Team assesses the threat level as HIGH given the destructive potential of the attacks**\n\n**Low-and-Slow: Prior to the deployment of the ransomware, the attackers attempt to infiltrate and move laterally throughout the organization,**\ncarrying out a fully-fledged hacking operation, or RansomOp.\n\n**Rapid Development Cycle: In just a few months, the Conti gang has released 3 new versions of the ransomware, improving the malware in**\neach version.\n\n**The Successor of Ryuk: The Conti Gang collaborated with the TrickBot Gang, which are now using Conti as their ransomware of choice.**\n\n**Spreading across the network: Conti is not satisfied with causing damage to just the infected machines. Instead, it spreads in the network**\nvia SMB and encrypts files on remote machines as well.\n\n**Detected and Prevented:** [The Cybereason Defense Platform fully detects and prevents the Conti ransomware.](https://www.cybereason.com/platform)\n\n[Similar to ransomware such as Egregor (“Egregor News”) and Maze (“Maze News”), the Conti Gang has their own website, “Conti News,”](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/cybereason-vs-egregor-ransomware)\nwhich stores a list of their victims, and it is where they publish the stolen data:\n\n_Conti News website_\n\nConti is a very destructive threat. Besides the double extortion that puts information and reputation at risk, the Conti operators equip it with a\nspreading capability, which means that Conti not only encrypts the files on the infected host but also spreads via SMB and encrypts files on\ndifferent hosts, potentially compromising the entire network. The rapid encryption routine takes just a few seconds to minutes due to its use of\nmultithreading, which also makes it very difficult to stop once the encryption routine starts.\n\n[Another major factor that contributes to the popularity of Conti is the collaboration with the TrickBot Gang. Conti is sold as a Ransomware-as-](https://www.databreachtoday.com/trickbot-rebounds-after-takedown-a-15213)\na-Service in underground forums to exclusive buyers and partners such as the TrickBot gang, which replaced Ryuk and adopted Conti as their\nnew ransomware of choice.\n\nIn addition to the sophisticated capabilities and the collaboration with the TrickBot gang, the increased number of Conti attacks against big\ncompanies such as Advantech, which was extorted for $13.8M, and other attacks against big North American based companies as listed in\n[this article, contributed to Conti making its way into the news this year. With a rapid development cycle that keeps the malware up-to-date and](https://www.blackfog.com/the-state-of-ransomware-in-2020/)\nequipped with advanced capabilities, along with the promotion done by the TrickBot gang, it is no wonder why Conti is referred to as the\nsuccessor of [Ryuk.](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/cybereason-vs.-ryuk-ransomware)\n\n### Breaking Down the Attack\n\n## From Bazar Backdoor to Ransomware\n\n\n-----\n\ne c ot Ga g as o to use t e a ous c ot a a e to sta t te act e ac g ope at o s a d dep oy g seco da y\n[payloads such as Ryuk and](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/triple-threat-emotet-deploys-trickbot-to-steal-data-spread-ryuk-ransomware) [Anchor.

This routine takes seconds to just a few minutes depending on the number of\nfiles on the machine. Each sample has a unique extension that the malware adds to the encrypted files. While using Cybereason with\nprevention mode off to allow investigation of the ransomware execution, it is possible to see the encryption activity and the creation of new\nfiles:\n\n_File Events feature in the Cybereason Defense Platform shows the encryption of the files_\n\nAfter the files are encrypted, the malware leaves the ransom note in every folder, making sure it is noticeable to the victim. The Conti Gang\nusually sets a deadline for the victim to pay the ransom, and if the deadline passes without payment, they leak the victim data on their website\n“Conti News.”\n\n### Cybereason Detection and Prevention\n\nThe [Cybereason Defense Platform is able to prevent the execution of Conti Ransomware using multi-layer protection that detects and blocks](https://www.cybereason.com/platform)\nmalware with threat intelligence, machine learning, and next-gen (NGAV) capabilities.
