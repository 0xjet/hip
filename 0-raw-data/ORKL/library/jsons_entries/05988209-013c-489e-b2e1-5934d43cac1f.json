Its scale\nand range are wide.\"\n\n\n-----\n\nPolish security services investigation is still ongoing, with evidence of the email hacking\nincident being collected.\n\n\"On Friday, Poland handed over to the EU Member States, the European Commission and\nthe Council a document on the details of cyber attacks carried out in recent days,\" an EU\n[diplomat with knowledge of the incident told Politico.](https://www.politico.eu/article/polish-politics-hit-with-by-cyberattack/)\n\nIn all, over 30 Polish MPs, government officials, and journalists were impacted by the attacks\nthat began last year, in September.\n\nThe \"operational and technical analysis carried out by Polish national cybersecurity incident\nresponse teams confirmed that the infrastructure and modus operandi used during\ncyberattacks were the same as those used by Russian-sponsored entities,\" the EU diplomat\nadded.\n\n## Polish officials' emails stolen and leaked on Telegram\n\nToday's statement comes after Michał Dworczyk, the Head of the Polish Prime Minister's\nOffice, said on June 9th that unknown attackers breached his email account.\n\nAt the time, Polish media reported that emails from government officials' private mailboxes\n[were stolen and leaked on a Telegram channel, according to Reuters.](https://www.reuters.com./world/europe/cyber-attack-polish-officials-came-russia-kaczynski-says-2021-06-18/)\n\n\"In connection with the reports of hacking into my email and my wife's mailbox, as well as our\n[social media accounts, the relevant state services were informed,\" Dworczyk said in a](https://twitter.com/michaldworczyk/status/1402390155877552129/)\nstatement.\n\n\"Currently, I cannot say when exactly my email account was successfully hacked, but I would\nlike to emphasize once again that I did not use it to send any information that could pose a\nthreat to state security,\" he [added two days later.](https://twitter.com/michaldworczyk/status/1403383133492416519/)\n\n## Ongoing Russian cyber-espionage activity\n\nThe Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) said one month ago that the Russianbacked hackers behind the SolarWinds supply-chain attack are now coordinating a large[scale phishing campaign targeting government agencies worldwide.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-russian-svr-hackers-target-govt-agencies-from-24-countries/)\n\n\"This wave of attacks targeted approximately 3,000 email accounts at more than 150\ndifferent organizations,\" MSTIC researchers revealed.\n\n\"While organizations in the United States received the largest share of attacks, targeted\nvictims span at least 24 countries.\"\n\n[The US govt also warned of continued cyber-espionage attacks in April, attacks coordinated](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-warns-of-russian-state-hackers-still-targeting-us-foreign-orgs/)\nby the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) (aka APT29).\n\n\n-----\n\nSVR operators target both US and foreign organizations, focusing on government networks,\nthink tanks and policy analysis orgs, and information technology companies.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Russian hackers perform reconnaissance against Austria, Estonia](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/russian-hackers-perform-reconnaissance-against-austria-estonia/)\n\n[Russian govt impersonators target telcos in phishing attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/russian-govt-impersonators-target-telcos-in-phishing-attacks/)\n\n[T-Mobile confirms Lapsus$ hackers breached internal systems](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/t-mobile-confirms-lapsus-hackers-breached-internal-systems/)\n\n[GitHub: Attackers stole login details of 100K npm user accounts](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/github-attackers-stole-login-details-of-100k-npm-user-accounts/)\n\n[Google shut down caching servers at two Russian ISPs](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/technology/google-shut-down-caching-servers-at-two-russian-isps/)\n\n\n-----",
