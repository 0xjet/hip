Initial statement of the Conti ransomware group professing its support for the\nRussian government\n_Update as of March 8, 2022: Added new information about spam email spreading_\n_NEGASTEAL malware. The IOC document has been updated to add indicators._\n\n_Update as of March 4, 2022: IOC document has been updated to add more indicators._\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine that started on February 24 has been in focus in the news.\nAlongside the physical battles that are on the ground, there have also been alleged\ncyberattacks perpetrated by different individuals, threat actors, and possibly even statesponsored groups.\n\nThe extensive amount of information that has been making the rounds has made it difficult to\nascertain the veracity of these cyberattacks, let alone accurately attribute them to a particular\nindividual or group. It’s easy to spread misinformation online, and there is plenty of incentive\n\n\n-----\n\nfor many parties to do so considering the important roles that information and intelligence\nplay in this conflict. It is also possible that some threat actors are capitalizing on the situation\ndespite not being directly involved in the conflict.\n\nWe have compiled all the materials that our research teams have verified and validated in\nthis blog entry to provide our customers with accurate information that they can use for their\nbenefit and protection. It’s important to note that we will continuously update this blog with\nvalidated threats as more events unfold.\n\nConti’s statement of support for the Russian government\n\nOn February 25, 2022, the [Conti ransomware group announced both its “full support” of the](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/ransomware-spotlight/ransomware-spotlight-conti)\nRussian government and its intention to strike back at anyone who organizes cyberattacks or\nwar activities against Russia. This message was posted on the Conti News leak website.\n\nA few hours after posting this statement, the group softened its stance, though it is unclear\nwhy. Conti is one of the most professional groups among the criminal organized crime gangs\n(OCGs), and it has dedicated subgroups akin to departments in a traditional business. It is\ntherefore possible that some members did not resonate with the group’s initial statement and\npushed back.\n\nFigure 2. The updated statement from Conti\nThe Conti intrusion set, which Trend Micro tracks under the moniker Water Goblin, has\nremained active despite other well-established ransomware groups shutting down in the\nwake of government sanctions. We also observed a spike in the volume of activity for the\nBazarLoader malware — a key enabler for Conti attacks — since early February 2022.\n\nConti chat logs leaked\n\nMeanwhile, external sources have reported on the chats of Conti operators being leaked by\na Ukrainian security researcher who had access to the back end of Conti's XMPP chat\nserver. Trend Micro Research extracted the logs and found some artifacts that can be used\nto map some indicators of compromise (IOCs), which we list in a later section of this blog.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe messages, which included ransom negotiations and Bitcoin addresses, can be used by\nsecurity companies and law enforcement to identify the attack techniques and tools used by\nthe Conti gang.\n\nConti’s onion site (contirec7nchr45rx6ympez5rjldibnqzh7lsa56lvjvaeywhvoj3wad.onion) is\nalso currently active. Based on this, we identified some recent Conti files as\nRansom.Win32.CONTI.SMYXBLD.\n\nStormous gang supports Russia\n\nWe are seeing some encouraging malicious deeds against both Ukrainians and Russians,\nbut some groups do choose to stand behind only one. The Stormous ransomware gang,\nknown for website defacement and information theft, represents itself as a group of Arabicspeaking hackers. The group has been active since 2021, and recently it officially announced\nits support for the Russian government and its intention to target Ukrainian government\ninstitutions such as the Ukrainian foreign ministry.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3. The Stormous group’s\n\nannouncement of its intent to target Ukraine, as seen on this security researcher’s Twitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/Cyberknow20/status/1498434090206314498\nUpon analyzing a sample of the malware from the group, we found that after infiltration, the\nmalware enables the actor to access and deploy different custom payloads to the affected\nserver via remote upload and open-source resources like Pastebin. Its capabilities, which\n\n\n-----\n\ninclude dropping malware, encryption, and sending a ransom note, can be hard to identify\nsince the actor can modify encryption and decryption keys, as well as copy ransom\nmessages in the wild. Additionally, since the actor’s backdoor or ransomware is PHP-based,\nit can be modified on the fly with minimal effort.\n\nFigure 4. Panels\n\nused by the Stormous ransomware group, with two selections: \"Backdoor\" and \"Python\nRansomware\"\nOther notable findings\n\nIn addition, the Emotet botnets (Epochs 4 and 5) have remained highly active since Emotet’s\nresurgence in November 2021, with a few sporadic periods of inactivity. Both families\ncontinue to actively drop Cobalt Strike beacons.\n\nBoth BazarLoader and Emotet continue to drop Cobalt Strike beacons as part of their second\nstage infections. With respect to Conti, we are tracking the regular deployment of new\ncommand-and-control (C&C) infrastructure for Cobalt Strike command beacons. It’s worth\nnoting that we have not yet observed a Conti attack following an Emotet infection since\nNovember 2021.\n\nWe also have a snapshot of malicious activity showing how some actors may be trying to\ncapitalize on the crisis. We compared our January and February data and saw that malicious\nURLs and emails trying to lure users with the subject of “Ukraine” increased steeply in the\nlatter part of February.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5.\n\nMalicious online and email activity referencing Ukraine in February 2022\nUkraine-related spam emails\n\nWe are seeing new scams and variants of older threats appear daily. Using our honeypot, we\nalso found Ukraine-related spam emails that aim to take advantage of the situation via\ndonations and other scams. These spam emails also drop the Ave Maria malware. We\nprovide IOCs in the relevant section of this blog.\n\nWe provide some examples here via the following screenshots:\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6. Examples of scams aiming to take advantage of the conflict\nTrend Micro continues to actively find and detect these threats before they can inflict damage\non our customers.\n\nAnalyzing reports from CERT-UA\n\nReports from outside Trend Micro have provided valuable insights into the alleged\ncyberattacks. In particular, the Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine or CERTUA released important details on the attacks launched against Ukrainian targets. Our own\nthreat researchers have also analyzed and investigated the latest information. Below is a\ntimeline of significant attacks recorded by CERT-UA.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7. Security incidents in Ukraine reported from January 2022 onward\nHostile activities in cyberspace are likely to increase as tension increases. Cyberattacks\naimed at Ukraine might also inadvertently extend to other countries and unsuspecting targets\n[might experience ricochets of attacks, similar to stray bullets. Therefore, it is important for](https://blog.trendmicro.co.jp/archives/24285)\neveryone — regardless of geographical location — to be aware of incidents occurring in\nUkraine.\n\nThe following sections provide both an analysis and an evaluation, conducted by Trend\nMicro, of three cyberattacks reported by CERT-UA.\n\nCyberattack using WhisperGate\n\nCERT-UA [reported that between January 13 and 14, 2022, approximately 70 Ukraine](https://cert.gov.ua/article/18101)\ngovernment agency websites were attacked, resulting in the modification of website content\nand system corruption. Supply chain attacks, OctoberCMS (a self-hosted content\n[management system used by enterprises), and the Log4j vulnerability are suspected to be](https://blog.trendmicro.co.jp/archives/29441)\nthe points of entry.\n\nSome of these attacks involved system corruption by malware. The diagram in Figure 8\nillustrates the infection chain of the malware observed in the attack. We list the malware\nnames as identified by CERT-UA here.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8. Relational diagram of malware seen in a cyberattack using WhisperGate\n\nBootPatch: This malware destroys the Master Boot Record (MBR) to make computers\nunbootable.\nWhisperGate: This malware downloads and executes additional payload from the C&C\nserver constructed on Discord.\nWhisperKill: This malware, downloaded by WhisperGate, destroys files with specific\nextensions.\n\nWhisperKill is designed to destroy and rename files in connected drives that match the file\nextensions shown in Figure 9. It then terminates and removes itself. WhisperKill enumerates\ndrives A to Z and destroys files on drives that are either Type 3 (DRIVE_FIXED) or 4\n(DRIVE_REMOTE), as shown in Figure 10.\n\n\n-----\n\nList of file extension targets for destruction, defined in a malware sample\n\n\nFigure 9.\n\nFigure 10.\n\n\nFile overwrite instruction\n[On February 24, there were also reports of another more sophisticated wiper malware with](https://mobile.twitter.com/ESETresearch/status/1496581916367151115)\nthe ability to destroy the MBR and files in drives. The malware is called HermeticWiper (also\nknown as FoxBlade).\n\nCyberattacks using SaintBot\n\n[In January 2022, there were reports of a series of cyberattacks that started from spear-](https://cert.gov.ua/article/18273)\nphishing emails disguised as messages from the National Healthcare Service of Ukraine.\nThe emails were attached with a document and two shortcut files, where one shortcut file\ndownloads and executes the OutSteel malware using PowerShell. The OutSteel malware\nthen downloads and executes the SaintBot malware. In February 2022, spear-phishing\nemails aiming to distribute the SaintBot malware disguised as messages from the Ukraine\n[Police were also reported.](https://cert.gov.ua/article/18419)\n\nThe SaintBot malware is designed to be inactive when the Language Code Identifier (LCID)\nof the infected device is Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Armenia, Kazakhstan, or Moldova (as\nseen in Figure 11). The intent behind this is unclear, and the inclusion of Ukraine might be a\nmistake considering that the spear-phishing emails are clearly targeting Ukraine.\n\nFigure 11.\n\nInstruction to check LCID\nThis malware sample attempts to bypass user account control (UAC) by exploiting\nFodhelper, which is introduced from the Windows 10 platform. By executing Fodhelper and\nadding a registry entry (shown in Figure 12), SaintBot is able to execute its own copy in a\nstartup folder with administrative privilege\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 12. Registry entry that enables UAC bypass by exploiting Fodhelper\nUpon callback, SaintBot collects information from the infected computers, then encrypts and\nencodes the data with XOR and BASE64. The data is attached to a prefix and sent to the\nC&C server with a POST request.\n\nThis malware sample holds the following C&C servers:\n\nhxxp://8003659902[.]space/wp-adm/gate.php\nhxxp://smm2021[.]net/wp-adm/gate.php\nhxxp://8003659902[.]site/wp-adm/gate.php\n\nCyberattack conducted by Gamaredon\n\nGamaredon is a threat actor said to be active since 2013. In March 2020, attacks were\nobserved in Japan and were considered stray bullets. In November 2021, the Security\n[Service of Ukraine made a public announcement that attributed Gamaredon to the Federal](https://ssu.gov.ua/en/novyny/sbu-vstanovyla-khakeriv-fsb-yaki-zdiisnyly-ponad-5-tys-kiberatak-na-derzhavni-orhany-ukrainy)\nSecurity Service of the Russian Federation (FSB). The Security Service of Ukraine also\n[published details of attack methodologies and a wiretap voice. Trend Micro observed similar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rci5xiyMv7k)\nattack methodologies.\n\nAttacks start from spear-phishing emails with document files that cause a Remote Template\n[Injection. In a cyberattack observed on the February 1, 2022, a document template was](https://cert.gov.ua/article/18365)\ndownloaded that included an obfuscated malicious macro. The macro stealthily opens a\ndocument (~~AddFromString) where the “VZ01” function is executed (Application.Run\n\"VZ01\") then closes it. This is illustrated in Figure 13.\n\nThis method, where a malicious macro is inserted into another document, was observed in a\npast incident said to be conducted by Gamaredon.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 13. Code that inserts and executes Virtual Basic for Applications (VBA) code to a\nnewly opened Word document\nThe decoded and inserted macro drops VBScript at %APPDATA%:define (ADS), and then a\nscheduled task to execute the script is registered. This script downloads and executes an\nadditional payload from the C&C server, similar to other attacks observed. The callback\ncontains an infected PC ID in User Agent, which is disguised to be a Yandex browser.\n\nThe following is the URL where the additional payload is requested:\n\nhxxp://<IP address of deep.deserts.coagula[.]online>/barefooted.cfg<Current Time + 1\nsecond> (e.g. hxxp://10.172.0[.]3/barefooted.cfg2022/02/03%2020:49:31)\n\nIf the response content size is over 16,965 bytes, the downloaded content is stored as\n“%USERPROFILE%\\Downloads\\demand.exe.tmp” and is executed after being renamed as\n“%USERPROFILE%\\Downloads\\demand.exe”.\n\nFor specific mitigation measures against the cyberattacks listed previously, see our post\n[here.](https://blog.trendmicro.co.jp/archives/30466)\n\nSecurity recommendations and best practices\n\nMalicious activity continues to spread, and actors are using new tools and tricks to lure\nvictims. In this section, we discuss mitigation measures to help prepare for a broad range of\nattacks:\n\n\n-----\n\nAvoid exposing infrastructure to the internet unless necessary.\nEnsure that multifactor authentication (MFA) is enabled for all accounts, not just the\nimportant ones.\nEnsure the timely deployment of patches, prioritizing internet-facing infrastructure and\nsensitive systems such as domain controllers.\nImmediately activate incident response measures in case there are red flags that\nindicate BazarLoader, Emotet, and Cobalt Strike activities.\n\n[For more guidance on how to manage cyber risks, please see our earlier blog post here.](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_ca/ciso/22/b/global-cyberattacks-cyber-risk.html)\n\nConclusion\n\nIn these tense circumstances, information is sent from conflicting viewpoints. Additionally,\neven if the same facts are reported correctly, impressions delivered might vary due to a\ndifference in perspectives.\n\nIt is also worth noting that the issuance of false information is always a possibility — whether\nor not this is done intentionally. As a result of such information, unnecessary confusion and\nfurther division might ensue. The following are some measures that our researchers take in\norder to understand information as correctly as possible:\n\nBe aware of the possibility of having assumptions (biases) and mistakes within the truth\nthat we believe.\nBe aware that we might be at the center of propaganda.\nRecognize that there is no such thing as a completely neutral and impartial source of\ninformation.\nDistinguish between “facts” and “opinions” or “assumptions” within information.\nWhen possible, trace the primary source of important information. One way to do this\nwould be to check the source of quoted articles and review their full content and the\ncontext of their statements.\nRefer to a reliable source of information, such as articles reviewed by multiple experts\nbefore release, as well as articles written by specialists.\n\n[For a full list of IOCs, please download this document.](https://www.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/research/22/c/cyberattacks-are-prominent-in-the-russia-ukraine-conflict/IOC%20Resource%20for%20Russia-Ukraine%20Conflict-Related%20Cyberattacks-03082022.pdf)\n\n\n-----",
