Since the_\n_foundation of QuoIntelligence in March 2020, this article was transferred to the_\n_QuoIntelligence website on 21 April 2020._\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nOver the last few years, QuoScient’s Intelligence Operations Team (QuoINT) has tracked\nactivities attributed to the Cobalt group, and observed their notable evolution and\ncontinuously improving Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs).\n\nSince September 2018, we have identified multiple attacks that share similar TTPs used by\nCobalt during a specific timeframe but exhibit enough differences to attribute them to\nseparate threat actors. This blog post provides an overview on a specific Malware-as-aService (MaaS) used within the e-Crime threat actor landscape. It also provides details on\ntwo different threat actors using the MaaS that fall under the umbrella of a family we dubbed\n_Golden Chickens: GC01 and GC02. The success of GC operations heavily relies on a_\nspecific MaaS sold in underground forums, which provides customers with the malwares and\nthe infrastructure they need for targeted attacks. The service owner provides the MaaS\nthrough the use of the following toolkits: Venom and Taurus building kits for crafting\ndocuments used to deliver the attack, and the more_eggs (aka Terra Loader, [SpicyOmelette)](https://www.secureworks.com/blog/cybercriminals-increasingly-trying-to-ensnare-the-big-financial-fish)\nbackdoor for taking full control of the infected computer.\n\nBetween November 2017 and July 2018, we attributed to GC02 five spear phishing waves\nwhich indiscriminately targeted companies and organizations in at least India and the United\nStates. As a result of using the same MaaS provider, GC02 and Cobalt group’s TTPs and\n\n\n-----\n\ninfrastructure strongly overlapped in May 2018, making it hard at first glance to differentiate\nthe two threat actors.\n\nBetween August and October 2018, we attributed to GC01 nine spear phishing waves\ntargeting multiple companies and organizations operating in the financial industry.\nThroughout the campaign, we observed the installation of multiple Remote Access Tool\n(RAT) variations as the result of a successfully compromised victim machine.\n\nBy highlighting the multi-layer infrastructure adopted by Cobalt and Golden Chickens, as well\nas the multi-client business model of the MaaS behind it, we emphasize the difficulty of\nperforming reliable attribution for cyberattacks, and the high uncertainty that analysts are\n[confronted with during the process. To note, other researchers reported the same Indicators](https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2018/10/unit42-new-techniques-uncover-attribute-cobalt-gang-commodity-builders-infrastructure-revealed/)\nof Compromise (IoC) and C2 infrastructure covered in this blog post. We hope that our\nattribution will clarify the current threat landscape and make the covered threat actor profiles\nmore accurate.\n\n_The following blog post is a preview of the Intelligence Assessment we will disseminate to_\n_our clients, partners, and vetted ._\n\n## Introduction\n\nCyber attribution is becoming increasingly challenging as threat actors frequently use false\nflag techniques and shared infrastructure to increase the resiliency of their operations\nagainst takedowns and law enforcement investigations. Especially for e-Crime actors, it is a\ncommon practice to rent the same bulletproof infrastructure or botnet used by other e-Crime\ngroups, resulting in the increased likelihood for an overlap of C2 servers. In the last years,\nwe have noted a tendency of threat actors outsourcing even more parts of the kill-chain to\nthird parties by using/offering MaaS solutions. Figure 1 shows an example of such a network\nwhere multiple stakeholders are involved.\n\n_, please visit the official QuoIntelligence Blog or access the article here: ._\n\n\n-----",
