When examined through the lens of North Korean military strategy, national\ngoals, and security perceptions, cyber activities correspond to their larger approach.\n\nRecorded Future research reveals that North Korean cyber actors are not crazy or irrational: they just have a wider\noperational scope than most other intelligence services.\n\nThis scope comprises a broad range of criminal and terrorist activity, including illegal drug manufacturing and\nselling, counterfeit currency production, bombings, assassination attempts, and more.

The RGB and, prior to 2009 its component parts, have been involved in everything from\nmaritime-inserted commando raids to abductions and spying. For the RGB to be in control of cyber assets indicates\nthat the DPRK intends to use these assets for provocative purposes.\n\n[The RGB probably consists of seven bureaus; six original bureaus and a new seventh (Bureau 121) that was likely](http://www.38north.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/38north_SR_Bermudez2.pdf)\nadded sometime after 2013.\n\n[RGB organizational chart, compiled with information from The Korea Herald, 38 North, and CSIS.](http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20100526000675)\n\n[Bureau 121 is probably North Korea’s primary cyber operations unit, but there are other units within the KPA and](http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/32926248/bureau-121-north-koreas-elite-hackers-and-a-tasteful-hotel-in-china)\nKWP that may also conduct cyber operations.\n\nAtt ib ti f ifi b ti it t th N th K t t i t lli i ti i diffi lt d til\n\n\n-----\n\nby the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and FBI on the tools and infrastructure used by cyber actors\n_of the North Korean government to target the media, aerospace, financial, and critical infrastructure sectors in the_\nUnited States and globally.”\n\nThis alert marked the first time the U.S. government linked threat actor groups and malware long-suspected to be\nutilized by North Korean state-sponsored actors with the with North Korean government itself.

This assessment, which was apparently issued internally last week, cited “moderate confidence” in the\nattribution and ascribed the April campaign as an “attempt to raise revenue for the regime.”\n\nThe attacks on the Bangladesh Central Bank, additional banks around the world, and the WannaCry ransomware\ncampaign represent a new phase in North Korean cyber operations, one that mirrors the phases of violence and\ncriminality North Korea has passed through over the past 50 years. We will examine these phases later in this post.\n\nThe broad operational range of known and suspected North Korean cyber operations has for years raised questions\nabout the rationality of North Korean leadership, possible motivations and benefits for the country from this type of\ncyber activity, and why North Korea would deny responsibility for these attacks. Recorded Future research\naddresses these questions by examining the whole picture and pairing geopolitical and strategic intelligence with\nthreat intelligence.\n\n### Analysis\n\nDigging into some of these past North Korean activities is important to add context to the cyber operations we have\ntracked since 2009. North Korea’s engagement in a wide range of criminal and terrorist activities is part of its broad\nnational strategy, which employs asymmetric operations and surprise attacks to overcome North Korea’s\n[conventional national power deficit.](http://ssi.armywarcollege.edu/pubs/parameters/Articles/97spring/jablonsk.htm)\n\nAccording to an interview with a former U.S. State Department official, and [North Korea expert, in Vanity Fair,](https://www.cnas.org/people/david-asher)\n“crime, in other words, has become an integral part of North Korea’s economy. ‘It not only pays, it plays to their\n\nstrategy of undermining Western interests.[1]’”\n\nIt is critical to place North Korea’s criminal and cyber activity in the context of its larger military and national security\n[strategies which support two primary objectives:](https://ssi.armywarcollege.edu/pdffiles/PUB771.pdf)\n\n1. Perpetuation of the Kim regime,\n\n2. Unification of the Korean peninsula under North Korean leadership.\n\n[A 2016 University of Washington study succinctly summarizes North Korea’s asymmetric military strategy:](https://jsis.washington.edu/news/north-korea-cyber-attacks-new-asymmetrical-military-strategy/)\n\nSince the end of the Korean War, North Korea has developed an asymmetric military strategy, weapons, and\nstrength because its conventional military power is far weaker than that of the U.S. and South Korea. Thus, North\nKorea has developed three military strategic pillars: surprise attack; quick decisive war; mixed tactics. First, its\nsurprise attack strategy refers to attacking the enemy at an unexpected time and place. Second, its quick decisive\nwar strategy is to defeat the South Korean military before the U.S. military or international community could\nintervene. Lastly, its mixed tactics strategy is to use multiple tactics at the same time to achieve its strategic goal.\n\n[Despite their near-constant tirade of bellicose rhetoric and professions of strength, North Korea fundamentally views](https://kcnawatch.co/search/?q=United+States)\nthe world from a position of weakness, and has developed a national strategy that utilizes its comparative strengths\n[— complete control over a population of 25 million people and unflinching, amoral devotion to the Kim hereditary](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/kn.html)\ndynasty.\n\nIn this context, criminality, terrorism, and destructive cyber attacks all fit within the North Korean asymmetric military\nstrategy which emphasizes surprise attacks and mixed tactics. The criminality and cyber attacks also have the\n\ndd d b f bli N th K t d i th i t ti l i d liti l t th t\n\n\n-----\n\n[Evidence is mounting that sanctions, international pressure, and possibly increased enforcement by China are](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Pages/nkorea.aspx)\nbeginning to take their toll on the North Korean economy and in particular, North Korea intelligence agent’s ability to\nprocure goods for regime leadership. A [May 2017 report from the Korea Development Institute concluded that North](http://www.kdi.re.kr/kdi_eng/research/research_view.jsp?pub_no=15221&pg=1&tema=G0&pp=10)\nKorea’s black market had helped the nation endure the impacts of the international sanctions last year.\n\nDetailed below are numerous non-cyber operations that have been conducted by the predecessor organizations of\nthe RGB. The violence, destruction, and criminal breadth of these operations reveal the broad operational scope of\nthese intelligence services and the context in which they are conducted.\n\nThis data further reveals a history of denials by North Korea of responsibility for operations dating back to the 1960s,\nputting into context the current leadership’s denials of cyber operations.\n\n### Note\n\nThe activities detailed below are intended to be illustrative, not an exhaustive list, of the broad operational remit for\nNorth Korean operations.\n\n### “Blue House Raid”\n\nOne of the first major attacks on South Korea since the [armistice was declared after the Korean War in 1953](https://www.archives.gov/historical-docs/todays-doc/?dod-date=727)\n[occurred in 1968.

The 31 North Korean soldiers\ncrossed the DeMilitarized Zone (DMZ) on foot and managed to get within a half mile of the President’s residence\n(the so-called “Blue House”) before being exposed. Upon discovery the North Korean soldiers engaged in a series\n[of firefights with South Korean forces; 68 South Koreans and three U.S. soldiers were killed. Most of the North](https://nkmonitor.wordpress.com/2008/01/21/remembering-the-blue-house-raid/)\nKorean soldiers were killed in the eight days after the raid; two made it back across the DMZ and one was captured.\n\nThe captured North Korean soldier claimed during a press conference that they had come to “cut Park Chung Hee’s\nthroat.” That account was disputed during [a secret meeting in 1972 between a South Korean intelligence official](http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&metadataPrefix=html&identifier=ADA461685)\nand the then-Premier Kim Il-sung.

Even if the evidence is strong, official government denials\ncreate uncertainty and give North Korea space to continue operations.\n\n### Impact\n\n[What has been missing from the discussion about whether North Korea is responsible for the WannaCry campaign](https://www.recordedfuture.com/wannacry-ransomware-analysis/)\nand the bank heists has been the why — the geopolitical and strategic intelligence that give CSOs, security\nprofessionals, and threat analysts context for the activity they are seeing.\n\nAs of last week the NSA and several companies, including [Symantec and Kaspersky, have linked the recent](https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/wannacry-ransomware-attacks-show-strong-links-lazarus-group)\nWannaCry ransomware campaign to North Korea; Recorded Future assesses that this type of cyber activity would\nfall within both North Korea’s “self-financing” policy and asymmetric military strategy.\n\n\n-----\n\nthese types of policies and strategies, Recorded Future believes that North Korean cyber operations (with the goal of\nacquiring hard currency) will continue for at least the short to medium term (one to three years). Additionally,\ndestructive cyber operations against the South Korean government and commercial entities will persist over this\nsame term and likely expand to Japanese or Western organizations if U.S. and North Korea tensions remain high.\n\nThe cyber threat environment and military strategy framed above indicate that companies in several major\neconomic sectors should increase monitoring of North Korean cyber activity. Financial services firms must remain\nconstantly vigilant to exploitation of their SWIFT connections and credentials, possible destructive malware attacks\nand DDoS, and threats to customer accounts and data. Companies in the government contracting and defense\n[sectors, especially companies that support the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system deployment as](https://missilethreat.csis.org/system/thaad/)\nwell as U.S. or South Korean operations on peninsula, should be aware of the heightened threat environment to\ntheir networks and operations on the Korean peninsula.\n\nEnergy and media companies, particularly those located in or that support these sectors in South Korea, should be\nalert to a wide range of cyber activity from North Korea, including DDoS, destructive malware, and ransomware\nattacks. Broadly, organizations in all sectors should continue to be aware of the adaptability of ransomware and\nmodify their cyber security strategies as the threat evolves.\n\nThis is part one of a two-part series on North Korea. In part two, we will examine patterns of behavior and internet\nactivity from North Korea, including the widespread use of virtual private servers (VPS) and virtual private networks\n(VPN) to obfuscate browsing, internet transactions, and other, possibly malicious, activity.\n\n\n-----",
