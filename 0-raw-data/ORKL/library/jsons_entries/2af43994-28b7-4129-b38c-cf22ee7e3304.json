And not without good\nreason. The threat may have been around a long time, but it’s changed. Year after year, the\nattackers have grown bolder, methodologies have been refined and, of course, systems have\nbeen breached. Yet, much of the media attention ransomware gets is focused on chronicling\nwhich companies fall prey to it. In this report, we take a step back from the day-to-day\nransomware news cycle and follow the ripples back into the heart of the ecosystem to\nunderstand how it is organized.\n\nFirst, we will debunk three preconceived ideas that obstruct proper thinking on the\nransomware threat. Next, we dive deep into the darknet to demonstrate how cybercriminals\ninteract with each other and the types of services they provide. And finally, we conclude with\na look at two high-profile ransomware brands: REvil and Babuk.\n\n\n-----\n\nNo matter how much work we put into writing this report, before you start reading, make sure\nyour data is backed up safely!\n\n## Part I: Three preconceived ideas about ransomware\n\n### Idea #1: Ransomware gangs are gangs\n\nAlong with the rise of big-game hunting in 2020, we saw the emergence of a number of highprofile groups in the ransomware world. Criminals discovered victims would be more likely to\npay ransoms if they could establish some form of reputability beforehand. To ensure that\ntheir ability to restore encrypted files would never be questioned, they cultivated an online\npresence, wrote press releases and generally made sure their name would be known to all\npotential victims.\n\nBut by placing themselves under the spotlight, such groups hide the actual complexity of the\nransomware ecosystem. From the outside, they may appear to be single entities; but they\nare in fact only the tip of the spear. In most attacks there are a significant number of actors\ninvolved, and a key takeaway is that they supply services to each other through dark web\nmarketplaces.\n\n_Botmasters and account resellers are tasked with providing initial access inside the victim’s_\nnetwork. Other members of this ecosystem, which we’ll name the red team for the purpose of\nthis discussion, use this initial access to obtain full control over the target network. During\nthis process, they will gather information about the victim and steal internal documents.\n\nThese documents may be forwarded to an outsourced team of analysts who will try to figure\nout the actual financial health of the target, in order to set the highest ransom price that they\nare likely to pay. Analysts will also keep a lookout for any sensitive or incriminating\ninformation which may be used to support their blackmail tactics – the goal being to put\nmaximum pressure on decision-makers.\n\nWhen the red team is ready to launch the attack, it will purchase a ransomware product from\ndark web developers, usually in exchange for a cut of the ransom. An optional role here is\nthe packer developer, who may add protection layers to the ransomware program and make\nit harder for security products to detect for the few hours it needs to encrypt the whole\nnetwork.\n\nFinally, negotiations with the victims may be handled by yet another team and when the\nransom is paid out, a whole new set of skills is needed to launder the cryptocurrency\nobtained.\n\nAn interesting aspect of all this is that the various actors in the “ransomware value chain” do\nnot need to personally know each other, and in fact they don’t. They interact with each other\nthrough internet handles, paying for services with cryptocurrency. It follows that arresting any\n\n\n-----\n\nof these entities (while useful for deterrence purposes) does little to slow down the\necosystem, as the identity of co-perpetrators cannot be obtained, and other suppliers will\nimmediately fill the void that was created.\n\nThe ransomware world must be understood as an ecosystem, and treated as such: it is a\nproblem that can only be addressed systematically, for instance by preventing the money\nfrom circulating inside of it – which involves not paying ransoms in the first place.\n\n### Idea #2: Targeted ransomware is targeted\n\nThe previous description of the ransomware ecosystem has noteworthy implications when it\ncomes to the way victims are selected. Yes, criminal groups are getting bolder and ask for\never-increasing ransoms. But ransomware attacks have an opportunistic aspect to them. As\nfar as we know, these groups do not peruse the Financial Times to decide who they are\ngoing after next.\n\nCounter-intuitively, the people who obtain the initial access to the victim’s network are not the\nones who deploy the ransomware later on; and it is helpful to think of access collection as an\nentirely separate business. For it to be viable, sellers need a steady stream of “product”. It\nmight not make financial sense to spend weeks trying to breach a predetermined hard target\nlike a Fortune 500 company because there’s no guarantee of success. Instead, access\nsellers go after the low-hanging fruit. There are two main sources for such access:\n\n**Botnet owners. Well-known malware families are involved in the biggest and most**\nwide-reaching campaigns. Their main objective is to create networks of infected\ncomputers, though the infection is only dormant at this point. Botnet owners\n(botmasters) sell access to the victim machines in bulk as a resource that can be\nmonetized in many ways, such as organizing DDoS attacks, distributing spam or, in the\ncase of ransomware, by piggybacking on this initial infection to get a foothold in a\npotential target.\n**Access sellers. Hackers who are on the lookout for publicly disclosed vulnerabilities**\n(1-days) in internet facing software, such as VPN appliances or email gateways. As\nsoon as such a vulnerability is disclosed, they compromise as many affected servers as\npossible before the defenders have applied the corresponding updates.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_An example of an offer to sell access to an organization’s RDP_**\n\nIn both cases, it is only after the fact that the attackers take a step back and figure out who\nthey have breached, and if this infection is likely to lead to the payment of a ransom. Actors\nin the ransomware ecosystem don’t do targeting in that they almost never choose to go after\nspecific entities. Understanding this fact underlines the importance for companies to update\ninternet-facing services in a timely fashion, and to have the ability to detect dormant\ninfections before they can be leveraged for wrongdoing.\n\n### Idea #3: Cybercriminals are criminals\n\nAlright, technically, they are. But this is also an area where there is more than meets the eye,\n[because of the diversity of the ransomware ecosystem. There is, of course, a documented](https://blogs.cisco.com/security/talos/c2-with-it-all-from-ransomware-to-carding)\nporosity between the ransomware ecosystem and other cybercrime domains such as carding\nor point-of-sale (PoS) hacking. But it is worth pointing out that not all members of this\necosystem originate from the cybercrime underworld. In the past, high-profile ransomware\n[attacks have been used as a destructive](https://securelist.com/expetrpetyanotpetya-is-a-wiper-not-ransomware/78902/) [means. It is not unreasonable to think that some](https://securelist.com/olympicdestroyer-is-here-to-trick-the-industry/84295/)\nAPT actors are still resorting to similar tactics to destabilize rival economies while\nmaintaining strong plausible deniability.\n\n[On the same note, we released a report last year about Lazarus group trying its hand at big-](https://securelist.com/lazarus-on-the-hunt-for-big-game/97757/)\n[game hunting. ClearSky identified similar activity that they attributed to the Fox Kitten APT.](https://www.clearskysec.com/pay2kitten/)\nObservers have noted that the obvious profitability of ransomware attacks has attracted a\nfew state-sponsored threat actors to this ecosystem as a way of circumventing international\nsanctions.\n\nOur data indicates that such ransomware attacks represent only a tiny fraction of the total.\nWhile they do not represent a rift in what companies need to be able to defend against, their\nvery existence creates an additional risk for victims. On October 1, 2020, the US Department\n[of the Treasury’s OFAC released a memo clarifying that companies wiring money to](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/126/ofac_ransomware_advisory_10012020_1.pdf)\nattackers need to ensure that the recipients are not subject to international sanctions. This\n\n\n-----\n\nannouncement appeared to be effective as it already [impacted the ransomware market. It](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/evil-corp-switches-to-hades-ransomware-to-evade-sanctions/)\ngoes without saying that performing due diligence on ransomware operators is a challenge\non its own.\n\n## Part II: The darknet shenanigans\n\n### Through the market lanes\n\nWhen it comes to the sale of digital goods or services related to cybercrime on the darknet,\nmost information is aggregated on just a few large platforms, though there are multiple\nsmaller thematic ones focusing on a single topic or product. We analyzed three main forums\non which ransomware-related offers are aggregated. These forums are the main platforms\nwhere cybercriminals that work with ransomware actively communicate and trade. While the\nforums host hundreds of various advertisements and offers, for analysis we selected just a\nfew dozen offers that had been verified by forum administrations and placed by groups with\nan established reputation. These ads included a variety of offers from the sale of source\ncode to regularly updated recruitment advertisements, available in English and Russian.\n\n### Different types of offers\n\nAs we noted before, the ransomware ecosystem consists of players that take on different\nroles. Darknet forums partially reflect this state of affairs, albeit the offers on these markets\nare aimed primarily at selling or recruiting. Just as with any marketplace, when operators\nneed something, they actively update their ad placements on forums and take them off as\nsoon as that need is fulfilled. Ransomware developers and operators of affiliate ransomware\nprograms (better known as Ransomware as a Service) offer the following:\n\nInvitations to join partner networks, affiliate programs for ransomware operators\nAds for ransomware source code or ransomware builders\n\nThe first type of involvement presumes a lengthy partnership between the ransomware group\noperator and the affiliate. Usually, the ransomware operator takes a profit share ranging from\n20% to 40%, while the remaining 60-80% stays with the affiliate.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Examples of offers listing payment conditions in partner programs_**\n\nWhile many ransomware operators look for partners, some sell ransomware source code or\ndo-it-yourself (DIY) ransomware packages. Such offers vary from US$300 to US$5000.\n\nSale of ransomware source code or the sale of leaked samples is the easiest way of making\nmoney off ransomware in terms of technical proficiency and effort invested by the seller.\nHowever, such offers also make the least money, as source code and samples quickly lose\ntheir value. There are two different types of offers – with and without support. If ransomware\nis purchased without support, once it is detected by cybersecurity solutions, the buyer would\nneed to figure out on their own how to repackage it, or find a service that does sample\nrepackaging – something that it still easily detected by security solutions.\n\nOffers with support (admittedly, more widespread in the financial malware market), usually\noffer regular updates and make decisions about malware updates.\n\n[In this regard, darknet forum offers have not changed much compared to 2017.](https://securelist.com/a-look-into-the-russian-speaking-ransomware-ecosystem/77544/)\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Ransomware developers sometimes advertise builders and source code as a one-off_**\n**_purchase with no customer support_**\n\n**_An offer of a subscription for ransomware and additional services looks very similar_**\n**_to any other ad for a legitimate product, with varying benefits and price range_**\n\n### Some of the big players aren’t seen on the darknet\n\nEven though the number and the range of offers available on the darknet certainly is not\nsmall, the markets do not reflect the whole ransomware ecosystem. Some large ransomware\ngroups either work independently or find partners directly (for instance, as far as we know,\nRyuk was able to access some of its victims’ systems after a Trickbot infection, which\nsuggests a potential partnership between two groups). Therefore, the forums generally host\nsmaller players – either medium-sized RaaS operators, smaller actors that sell source code\nand newbies.\n\n### Ground rules for affiliates on the darknet\n\nThe ransomware market is a closed one, and the operators behind it are careful about who\nthey choose to work with. This caution is reflected in the ads the operators place and criteria\nthey impose when selecting partners.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe first general rule is that of geographical restrictions placed on the operators. When\nmalware operators work with partners, they avoid using the malware in the jurisdiction where\nthey are based. This rule is strictly adhered to and partners that don’t abide by it quickly lose\naccess to the programs they have been working with.\n\nAdditionally, operators screen potential partners to reduce the chances of hiring an\nundercover official, for instance, by checking their knowledge of the country they claim to be\nfrom, as illustrated in the example below. They may also impose restrictions on certain\nnationalities based on their political views. These are just some of the ways operators try to\nensure their security.\n\n**_In this example the gang recommends vetting new affiliates by asking obscure_**\n**_questions about the history of former Soviet republics and expressions that typically_**\n**_only native Russian speakers could answer_**\n\n**_Avaddon may consider English-speaking affiliates if they have an established_**\n**_reputation or can provide a deposit, according to this ad_**\n\n## The merchants\n\nFor a more detailed overview we chose two of the most noteworthy Big Game Hunting\nransomware in 2021.\n\nThe first one is the REvil (aka Sodinokibi) gang. Since 2019, this ransomware has been\nadvertised on underground forums and has a strong reputation as a RaaS operator. The\ngang’s name REvil often appears in news headlines in the infosecurity community. REvil\noperators have demanded the highest ransoms in 2021.\n\nThe other is the Babuk locker. Babuk is the first new RaaS threat discovered in 2021,\ndemonstrating a high level of activity.\n\n### REvil\n\n\n-----\n\n**_An example of an ad placed by the REvil affiliate program_**\n\nREvil is one of the most prolific RaaS operations. The group’s first activity was observed in\nApril 2019 after the shutdown of GandCrab, another now-defunct ransomware gang.\n\nTo distribute ransomware, REvil cooperates with affiliates hired on cybercriminal forums. The\nransom demand is based on the annual revenue of the victim, and distributors earn between\n60% and 75% of the ransom. Monero (XMR) cryptocurrency is used for payment. According\nto the interview with the REvil operator, the gang earned over $100 million from its\noperations in 2020.\n\nThe developers regularly update the REvil ransomware to avoid detection and improve the\nreliability of ongoing attacks. The group announces all major updates and availability of new\npartner program items in their various threads on cybercriminal forums. On April 18, 2021,\nthe developer announced that the *nix implementation of the ransomware was undergoing\nclosed testing.\n\n**_REvil informs about the internal testing of the *nix implementation of the ransomware_**\n\n### Technical details\n\nREvil uses the Salsa20 symmetric stream algorithm for encrypting the content of files and\nthe keys for it with an elliptic curve asymmetric algorithm. The malware sample has an\nencrypted configuration block with many fields, which allow attackers to fine-tune the\npayload. The executable can terminate blacklisted processes prior to encryption, exfiltrate\nbasic host information, encrypt non-whitelisted files and folders on local storage devices and\nnetwork shares. A more detailed account of the technical capabilities of REvil is available in\nour [private and](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/comparison/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL) [public reports.](https://securelist.com/sodin-ransomware/91473/)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe ransomware is now distributed mainly through compromised RDP accesses, phishing,\nand software vulnerabilities. The affiliates are responsible for gaining initial access to\ncorporate networks and deploying the locker – a standard practice for the RaaS model. It\nshould be noted that the gang has very strict recruitment rules for new affiliates: REvil\nrecruits only Russian-speaking highly skilled partners with experience in gaining access to\nnetworks.\n\nPrivilege elevation, reconnaissance and lateral movement follow a successful breach. The\noperators then evaluate, exfiltrate and encrypt sensitive files. The next stage is negotiations\nwith the attacked company. If the victim decides not to pay their ransom, the REvil operators\nwill start publishing the sensitive data of the attacked company on the .onion Happy Blog\nsite. The tactic of publishing exfiltrated confidential data on leak sites has recently gone\nmainstream among Big Game Hunting players.\n\n**_An example of a post on REvil’s blog that includes data stolen from the victim_**\n\nIt’s worth noting that ransomware operators have started using voice calls to business\npartners and journalists, as well as DDoS attacks, to force their victims to pay a ransom. In\nMarch 2021, according to the operator, the gang launched a service at no extra cost for\naffiliates that contacts the victim’s partners and the media to exert maximum pressure, plus\nDDoS (L3, L7) as a paid service.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_REvil announces a new feature to arrange calls to the media and the target’s partners_**\n**_to exert additional pressure when demanding a ransom_**\n\nAccording to [our research, this malware affected almost 20 business sectors. The largest](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/top5-ransomware-groups/39426/)\nshare of victims fell into the category Engineering & Manufacturing (30%), followed by\nFinance (14%), Professional & Consumer Services (9%), Legal (7%), and IT &\nTelecommunications (7%).\n\nThe victims of this campaign include companies such as Travelex, Brown-Forman Corp., the\npharmaceutical group Pierre Fabre, and the celebrity law firm Grubman Shire Meiselas &\n[Sacks. In March 2021, the gang breached Acer and demanded the highest recorded ransom](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/computer-giant-acer-hit-by-50-million-ransomware-attack/)\nof $50 million.\n\nOn April 18, 2021, a member of the REvil group announced that the gang was on the cusp of\ndeclaring its “most high-profile attack ever” in a post on forums where cybercriminals recruit\nnew affiliates. On April 20, the group published a number of alleged blueprints for Apple\ndevices on the Happy Blog site. According to the attackers, the data was stolen from\nQuanta’s network. Quanta Computer is a Taiwan-based manufacturer and one of Apple’s\npartners. [Quanta’s initial ransom demand was $50 million.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/revil-gang-tries-to-extort-apple-threatens-to-sell-stolen-blueprints/)\n\n**_In the past few quarters there has been a sharp spike in REvil’s targeted activity_**\n**_[(download)](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2021/05/11121843/Ransomware_world_in_2021_15.png)_**\n\nThe REvil gang is a prime example of a Big Game Hunting player. In 2021, we are seeing a\ntrend towards bigger ransoms for sensitive company data. The use of new tactics to\npressure the victim, the active development of non-Windows versions and the regular\nrecruitment of new affiliates all suggest that the number and scale of attacks will only grow in\n2021.\n\n### Babuk\n\nAnother player in the Big Game Hunting scene in 2021 is the Babuk locker. At the beginning\nof 2021 we observed several incidents involving this ransomware.\n\n[At the end of April 2021, the threat actors behind Babuk announced the end of their activity,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/babuk-ransomware-readies-shut-down-post-plans-to-open-source-malware/)\nstating that they will make their source code publicly available in order to “do something like\nOpen Source RaaS”. This means that we’ll probably see a new wave of ransomware activity\nas soon as various smaller threat actors adopt the leaked source code for their operations.\nWe’ve seen this sort of situation happen before with other RaaS and MaaS projects – the\n[Cerberus banking Trojan for Android is a good example from last year.](https://www.kaspersky.com/about/press-releases/2020_the-rise-of-cerberus)\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Babuk announcement about the end of operations_**\n\nThe group obviously customizes each sample for each victim because it includes a\nhardcoded name of the organization, personal ransomware note and extensions of the\nencrypted files. Babuk’s operators also use the RaaS model. Prior to infection, affiliates or\nthe operators compromise the target network, so they can identify how to deploy the\nransomware effectively and evaluate the sensitive data in order to set the highest realistic\nransom price for the victim. The team behind Babuk defines their group as CyberPunks that\n“randomly test corporate networks security,” using RDP as an infection vector. The gang\noffers 80% of the ransom to their affiliates.\n\n**_An example of an ad placed by the Babuk affiliate program_**\n\nBabuk advertises on both Russian-speaking and English-speaking underground forums. At\nthe beginning of January 2021, an announcement appeared on one forum about the new\nransomware Babuk, with subsequent posts focusing on updates and affiliate recruitment.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Babuk’s announcement to the press explaining their strategy and victim selection_**\n\nBabuk’s whitelist prevents any targeting in the following countries: China, Vietnam, Cyprus,\nRussia and other CIS countries. The operators also prohibit the compromise of hospitals,\nnon-profit charities, and companies with an annual revenue of less than $30 million\naccording to ZoomInfo. To join the affiliate program, a partner must pass an interview on\nHyper-V and ESXi hypervisors.\n\nBabuk made the headlines for being probably the first ransomware gang to publicly declare a\nnegative stance towards the LGBT and Black Lives Matter (BLM) communities. It was due to\nthis fact that the group excluded these communities from their whitelist. But in a post on the\nBabuk data leak site about the results of two months of work, the gang reported that they\nhad added LGBT and BLM foundations and charity organizations to their whitelist.\n\n**Technical details**\n\nFor encryption Babuk uses a symmetric algorithm combined with Elliptic curve Diffie–\nHellman (ECDH). After successful encryption, the malware drops a hardcoded ransom note\nas “How To Restore Your Files.txt” into each processed directory. In addition to the text, the\nransom note contains a list of links to screenshots of some exfiltrated data. This proves that\nthe malware sample is crafted after the victim’s data is exfiltrated. As mentioned above, each\nsample is customized for the specific target.\n\nIn the ransom note, the gang also suggests that the victim starts the negotiation process\nusing their personal chat portal. These steps aren’t exclusively tied to Babuk but are\ncommonly present in Big Game Hunting campaigns. Remarkably, the text of the ransom note\n\n\n-----\n\nalso contains a private link to the related post on the .onion data leak site, which is not\naccessible from the main page of the site. There are some screenshots, as well as a text\ndescription of the types of stolen files, and general threats addressed to the victim. If the\nvictim decides not to negotiate with cybercriminals, the link to this post will be made public.\n\nThe group behind the Babuk locker primarily targets large industrial organizations in Europe,\nthe US and Oceania. Targeted industries include, but are not limited to, transportation\nservices, the healthcare sector, and various suppliers of industrial equipment. In fact, recent\ncases show that Babuk operators are expanding their targets. On April 26, the D.C. Police\nDepartment confirmed that its network had been breached, with the Babuk operator claiming\nresponsibility and announcing the attack on their .onion leak site.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Babuk’s announcement of a successful attack on the D.C. Police Department_**\n\n[According to the post on this site, the gang was able to exfiltrate more than 250 GB of data](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/dc-police-confirms-cyberattack-after-ransomware-gang-leaks-data/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1620129370848000&usg=AOvVaw20nSoCceOtgyw3jh0Qr_X8)\nfrom Washington’s Metropolitan Police Department network. At the time of writing, the police\ndepartment had three days to start the negotiation process with the attackers; otherwise, the\ngroup would start leaking data to criminal gangs. Babuk also warned that it would continue to\nattack the US state sector.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Babuk operator’s screenshots of stolen files from the D.C. Police Department’s_**\n**_network published on the darknet leak site_**\n\n## Conclusion\n\n[On April 23, 2021, we released ransomware statistics that revealed a significant decline in](https://securelist.com/ransomware-by-the-numbers-reassessing-the-threats-global-impact/101965/)\nthe number of users who had encountered this threat. These numbers should not be\nmisinterpreted: while it is true that random individuals are less likely to encounter\nransomware than they used to, the risk for companies has never been higher.\n\nEver eager to maximize profits, the ransomware ecosystem has evolved and can now be\nconsidered a systemic threat for corporations all around the world.\n\nThere was a time where SMBs could mostly ignore the challenges posed by information\nsecurity: they were small enough to stay under the radar of APT actors, but still big enough\nnot to be affected by random and generic attacks. Those days are over, and all companies\ntoday are now in a position where they must be prepared to fend off criminal groups.\n\n\n-----\n\nThankfully, such attackers will usually go after the low-hanging fruit first, and setting up\nappropriate security practices will make a world of difference.\n\nOn May 12, which is Anti-Ransomware Day, Kaspersky encourages organizations to follow\nthese best practices to help safeguard your organization against ransomware:\n\nAlways keep software up to date on all your devices to prevent attackers from\ninfiltrating your network by exploiting vulnerabilities.\nFocus your defense strategy on detecting lateral movements and data exfiltration to the\ninternet.
