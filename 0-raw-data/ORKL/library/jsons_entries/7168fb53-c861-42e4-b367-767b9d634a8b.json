One of the interesting findings is that the attackers\nregistered the command and control (C2) domain years before they launched intense penetration\nactivities on the domain. This behavior is typical for APT attacks because these actors often penetrate\nnetworks broadly and then focus more effort on high-value targets – their trojans usually stay dormant in\nvictims' networks before the operators decide on targets and exploit them actively. However, attackers\ngain a benefit from using strategically aged domains – domains registered in advance sometimes take\nlonger to detect when they begin malicious activity because they’ve developed a benign reputation over\ntime. Other actors engaged in network abuses such as phishing and black hat search engine optimization\n\n\n-----\n\n(SEO) can also deploy campaigns with aged domains to benefit from the reputation built by their long\nlifetime. Besides, attackers usually register multiple domains in advance so that they can resume the\nmalicious service to the backup domains quickly if the primary entry point is blocked.\n\nMalicious dormant domains will present abnormally sudden traffic increments when they are involved in\nactive campaigns. Therefore, we launched a cloud-based detector to monitor domains' activities and\nidentify these strategically aged domains. It extracted about 30,000 domains every day from fine-grained\npassive domain name system (DNS) data. These domains typically have limited traffic for months to years\nand then gain more than 10.3 times the traffic increment within one day. Their malicious rate is more than\n[three times higher than that of newly registered domains (NRDs). And 22.27% of them are malicious,](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/newly-registered-domains-malicious-abuse-by-bad-actors/)\nsuspicious or not safe for work.\n\nDuring the SolarWinds supply chain attack, the trojan employed domain generation algorithms (DGA) to\nexfiltrate the identities of target machines with subdomains. To uncover similar APT attacks, we scan all\nhostnames of strategically aged domains and recognize those that activate with a significant amount of\nemerging DGA subdomains as potential attacking domains. Each of these potential attacking domains\ngenerated about 161 DGA subdomains to carry 43.19% of their burst traffic. As they are identified, these\n[suspicious domains are released to Palo Alto Networks Next-Generation Firewall security subscriptions,](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/next-generation-firewall)\n[including DNS Security.

At Palo Alto Networks, we](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/newly-registered-domains-malicious-abuse-by-bad-actors/)\nmonitor DNS zone files and passive DNS data to detect NRDs. We advise our customers to block these\n[domains for 32 days after their registration. Furthermore, we developed a proactive abuse detector to](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/proactive-detector/)\n[expose emerging malicious domains before a patient zero web threat appears. However, it's not enough](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/patient-zero-web-threats/)\nto focus on the threats behind NRDs only.\n\nThreat actors may register domains long before launching attacking campaigns on them. There are\nvarious motivations for this strategy. First of all, the longer life of aged domains can help them evade\nsome reputation-based detectors. Secondly, C2 domains belonging to APTs can sometimes be inactive\nfor years. During the dormant period, APT trojans only send limited “heartbeat” traffic to their C2 servers.\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce the attackers decide which targets are valuable to them and start active exploits, the C2 domain will\nreceive significantly more penetration traffic. For example, the C2 domain of the SolarWinds supply chain\nattack, avsvmcloud[.]com, was registered in 2018 and had stayed dormant for two years before carrying a\nhigh amount of attack traffic beginning in March 2020. We observed that its passive DNS traffic increased\naround 165 times after the attack started. Therefore, it's essential to keep monitoring domains' activities\nand digging for threats behind aged domains associated with abnormal traffic increases.\n\nAt Palo Alto Networks, we have been collecting passive DNS data for more than 10 years. This dataset\nprovides us visibility into a domain's activity based on its DNS traffic in our customers' networks as well as\nthe global network. We recently migrated our passive DNS system to a cloud platform, gaining scalable\nstorage and computing resources. This enables us to generate fine-grained DNS trend data for each\nhostname. Based on this trend data, we developed a detector identifying domains with trends of\nabnormally increasing traffic.\n\nOur system quantifies a domain's activity degree by the volume of its DNS traffic within a specific time\nwindow. We use two thresholds to divide the activity index range into three groups: dormant domains\n(those below the 75th percentile of our activity index), standard domains (those between the 75th and\n95th percentile) and highly active domains (the top 5%).\n\nWhen a domain starts hosting a legitimate launched service, its traffic usually grows gradually. On the\ncontrary, it's abnormal for a domain to stay in the dormant status for a long time and then suddenly get a\nlarge burst of traffic. Based on this intuition, our system continuously monitors the traffic of dormant\ndomains and captures those that jump to highly active status within a short time as strategically aged\ndomains.\n\nFigure 1. Number of daily strategically aged domains.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2. Normalized DNS traffic of strategically aged domains.\nAs shown in Figure 1, our detector captured around 26,000 strategically aged domains every day in\nSeptember 2021. In Figure 2, we plot the average DNS traffic around the day strategically aged domains\nreceived burst traffic. The trend data is normalized based on the activation day's traffic – i.e. the\nnormalized DNS traffic of day zero is 1. On the activation day, these domains' activities have grown 11.3\ntimes on average. After that, the average daily traffic continues increasing and reaches more than six\ntimes higher. We observed about 1.3 million daily DNS requests from our DNS security customers'\nnetworks to these domains every day after they were activated.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3. Category distribution of strategically aged domains.\nTo evaluate the threats these strategically aged domains presented, we retrieved information on how they\n[are categorized from Palo Alto Networks URL Filtering, as well as their VirusTotal scores. We split the](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/9-0/pan-os-admin/url-filtering.html)\ndomains into four groups: malicious, suspicious, not safe for work and other. The malicious group\nincludes domains that are malware, command and control, grayware and phishing or have been detected\nby any VirusTotal vendor. For the suspicious group, we include domains categorized as parked,\nquestionable, insufficient content and high risk. Nudity, adult, gambling and similar subjects are labeled as\nnot safe for work. Those that don't fall into any of these groups are tagged as “other.” 3.8% of strategically\naged domains present malicious behaviors. This percentage is more than three times higher than that of\nthe NRDs, which is 1.27%. Not only that, 24.8% of strategically aged domains are malicious, suspicious\nor not safe for work. For comparison, out of the Alexa Top 1,000 domains, only 0.07% fall into these\ncategories.\n\n## DGA Subdomain Detection\n\nAfter identifying strategically aged domains, we move forward to uncover ongoing attacks based on their\nDNS traffic profiles. We referred to the DNS characteristics of the SolarWinds supply chain attack in order\nto build a detector that can capture similar APT attacks.\n\n### DNS Characteristics of the SolarWinds Supply Chain Attack\n\nDuring the SolarWinds campaign's dormant stage, the SUNBURST trojan periodically contacted its C2\ndomain, avsvmcloud[.]com, to report status and receive commands. This heartbeat communication was\ncarried by static hostnames and the traffic volume was limited. However, when the C2 domain woke up\nfrom the incubation period, the majority of burst DNS requests were for new subdomains. The trojan\ndynamically constructed these hostnames with domain generation algorithms (DGAs) to exfiltrate data.\nSpecifically, the subdomains were generated in the form DGAstring.appsyncapi.region.avsvmcloud[.]com. The DGA strings were encoded victims' identities, containing the infected\norganizations' domain names and security product statuses. When the attacker's DNS resolver received\n\n\n-----\n\nrequests for these hostnames, it returned CNAME responses pointing to different C2 servers based on\nthe exfiltrated information. To sum up, the malware leveraged DGA subdomains to exfiltrate data and\nprovided a proxy layer for the attacking infrastructure.\n\n### Applying These DNS Insights\n\nTo capture similar C2 traffic, our DGA subdomain detector scans all subdomains of strategically aged\ndomains. It labels those with burst DNS requests to DGA subdomains as potential APT C2 domains. After\nthat, we implement several filters to recognize legitimate services based on additional information such as\nWHOIS records and benign hostname patterns.\n\nFigure 4. Cumulative distribution figure (CDF) of detected domains’ DGA traffic rate.\nOn average, our DGA subdomain detector identified two suspicious domains every day. After the\nactivation day, each strategically aged domain has about 2,443 newly observed subdomains, and 161 of\nthem are DGA subdomains. Figure 4 shows the CDF of their DGA traffic percentage after waking up. The\nDGA traffic rate is higher than 36.76% for half of these domains.\n\n## Case Studies\n\n### APT Spyware\n\nOur DGA subdomain detector captured the abnormal DNS traffic patterns of the Pegasus spying\ncampaign. Pegasus spyware can infect iOS and Android devices to collect credential information and\ntrack user behaviors including calls and geolocation history. The two detected C2 domains,\npermalinking[.]com and opposedarrangement[.]net, were registered in 2019 and awoke in July 2021 with\na high percentage of DGA traffic.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5. DNS traffic trend of Pegasus spyware C2 domains.As shown in Figure 5, there were around 15\ndaily DNS requests to the campaign's domains before July 18, 2021. On the activation day, the daily DNS\ntraffic suddenly increased 56 times. The campaign used several DGA subdomains, such as\nimgdsg4f35.permalinking[.]com and php78mp9v.opposedarrangement[.]net, to carry C2 traffic. In general,\nthe amount of DGA traffic increased following the overall traffic trend. However, the percentage of DGA\ntraffic has increased significantly during the campaign. The old percentage of DGA traffic was 23.22%\nbefore July 18, compared to 42.04% later.\n\n### Phishing\n\nFigure 6. Cloaking script of phishing gateway hosted on ui1io[.]cn. (URLs have been obscured).Besides\nC2 domains, our detector also exposes a phishing campaign producing DGA DNS traffic on a strategically\naged domain. In this phishing attack, the usage of the DGA subdomains is similar to that seen in the\nSolarWinds supply chain attack. DGA subdomains are used to provide a proxy layer before the actual\nmalicious websites. For example, the script on one of the gateway hostnames,\njcxivnmqfqoiopdlvejvgucpmrfgmhwdlrkvzqyb.ui1io[.]cn, (Figure 6) forwards the visitor to another phishing\nDGA domain, gjahqfcyr[.]cn, when a specific parameter exists in the URL. Otherwise, it redirects to the\nlegitimate bank website. Therefore, this DGA subdomain is a cloaking layer that hides the actual phishing\ncontent from unwanted visitors and crawlers. Our system observed an abnormal increment of traffic to the\nDGA subdomains of ui1io[.]cn on Oct. 2, 2021.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Apart from gateway hostnames, phishing campaigns could use DGA strings to generate levelsquatting](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/cybersquatting/)\nhostnames. These strings could separate the deceptive sections and the root domains. For example, the\ndomain mailingmarketing[.]net was created in 2020. Our system identified it as a strategically aged\ndomain on Sept. 23, 2021, at which time it had 47 new DGA subdomains such as\nuk.id.login.update.ssl.encryption-6159368de39251d7alogin.id.security.trackid.piwikb7c1867dd7ba9c57.fd685e42f1d69c71708ff549fea71274.mailingmarketing[.]net.\nThese subdomains hosted a fake virus scanning page. They are so long that victims may only notice the\nfront sections and think they’re legitimate encrypted login services, neglecting to check the root domain in\nthe end. This is especially likely for mobile users – mobile browsers will fail to display the fully qualified\ndomain name (FQDN) in the address bar, but instead only show the truncated string in the beginning.\n\n### Wildcard DNS Abuse\n\nFigure 7. Randomly generated website hosted on fiorichiari[.]com.Our system also captured several\ncases in which gray services leverage DGA subdomains to build their infrastructure. For example,\nfiorichiari[.]com has a wildcard DNS record to point all of its subdomains to the same IP address. The\nservice operator registered the domain on July 27, 2021. We observed burst DNS requests for its DGA\nsubdomains since Sept. 29, 2021. These hostnames serve randomly generated websites that fill out\nsome website templates with random strings (Figure 7). They could be used for black hat SEO.\nSpecifically, these web pages link to each other to obtain a high rank from search engine crawlers without\nproviding valuable information.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThreat actors can register domains long before using them for attacking campaigns. For example, APT\nmalware can stay dormant for years and then suddenly activate and produce a large amount of exploiting\ntraffic through their C2 domains. Our advanced cloud-based passive DNS system enables us to identify\n\n\n-----\n\ndomains presenting abnormal traffic increment patterns as strategically aged domains. These domains\nhave a higher malicious percentage compared to NRDs. We also developed a detector to recognize\nmalicious strategically aged domains based on their traffic distribution and subdomains' characteristics.\nThese suspicious domains could leverage DGA to exfiltrate data through DNS traffic, provide proxy layers\n[ahead of the attacking services and create levelsquatting hostnames.](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/cybersquatting/)\n\nAt Palo Alto Networks, our strategically aged domain and DGA subdomain detection system monitors\npassive DNS trend data to expose potential attacks.
