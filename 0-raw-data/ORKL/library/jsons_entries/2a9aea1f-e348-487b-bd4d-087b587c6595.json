    "plain_text": "# ICS-CERT - 2010 YEAR IN REVIEW\n\n## January 2011\n\n\n## A LOOK BACK\n\n\nThe past year has been a busy and unprecedented year for both the Industrial Control Systems Cyber\nEmergency Response Team (ICS-CERT) and the control systems community. The most notable event was the\nemergence of Stuxnet, the first malware created specifically to target industrial control systems (ICS). ICS­\nCERT analysts and researchers across industry dissected and unraveled the malware revealing a sophisticated\ntrail of zero-days, anti-detection, and propagation techniques.\n\nSince Stuxnet’s discovery, news outlets and bloggers have flooded cyberspace with a barrage of analysis and\nconjecture behind who created it and who was the intended target. While many theories abound, it is the\nDepartment’s mission to remain focused on the risk mitigations and collaborate with the 18 Critical\nInfrastructure/Key Resource (CIKR) sectors to promote preparedness and information sharing. ICS-CERT\naccomplished this through sector briefings, meetings, conferences, and other engagements to meet with asset\nowners and operators, vendors, and federal/state/local partners to discuss concerns and mitigations for this and\nother threats. For many, Stuxnet signaled a paradigm shift with the ICS community, demonstrating that\norganizations must be operationally prepared with tools, systems, and personnel to detect malicious activity and\neffectively mitigate the impact to their control systems.\n\nWhile Stuxnet was a dominating force in 2010, other advanced persistent threats (APT) became commonplace\nacross industry. This uptick in activity resulted in the development of “fly-away” teams to provide onsite\nassistance to asset owners in response to a cyber incident. Many of these fly-away engagements were conducted\nin conjunction with US-CERT through the newly formed National Cybersecurity and Communications\nIntegration Center (NCCIC pronounced ‘n-kick’). The NCCIC was established by the US Department of\nHomeland Security (DHS) to improve communications between the private sector and government. ICS­\nCERT’s role within the integrated NCCIC framework is to enhance DHS cyber incident response efforts and to\nensure that control systems security issues are addressed.\n\nBoth the NCCIC and ICS-CERT were thoroughly put to the test during the national-level CyberStorm III\nexercise held in September. At its core, the exercise was intended to assess and strengthen cyber preparedness\nand incident response capabilities among federal, state, local, international and private sector companies. The\nexercise involved thousands of players from federal departments and agencies, state and local governments,\ntwelve countries, and nearly sixty private sector companies to simulate a large-scale cyber attack on critical\ninfrastructure. The exercise and its scenarios underscored the importance of control systems and the critical\ninfrastructure that they operate.\n\nThis report looks back at 2010 and highlights significant activities and events affecting ICS. It also provides\nlessons learned and links to resources that organizations can use to help better prepare for the “next Stuxnet.”\nICS-CERT looks forward to 2011 as it continues this important mission to advance the state of awareness and\npreparedness.\n\n## ICS-CERT Year in Review – 2010 Page 1 of 7\n\n\n-----\n\nSTUXNET\n\n\nThe year 2010 was unarguably the year of Stuxnet, a sophisticated and advanced piece of malware that\nleveraged zero-day exploits, digitally signed certificates, and employed evasion techniques to propagate and\navoid detection. The publicity surrounding Stuxnet has raised awareness within critical infrastructure\norganizations that may have otherwise taken several years to accomplish by normal outreach methods. It has\nhighlighted the interdependencies and vulnerabilities that exist in legacy control system environments and\ndemonstrated that motivated groups are interested in attacking them. Stuxnet has become a wake-up call to\nmany that “security through obscurity” is no longer an option.\n\nWhile Stuxnet will likely be studied and reported on for years to come, the salient lesson is the importance of\nremaining vigilant of cyber threats, employing detection mechanisms, and having an incident response plan in\nplace to respond quickly when incidents occur.\n\n**LESSONS LEARNED**\n\n- CIKR asset owners need to employ policies concerning the use of USB drives and other removable media\nwithin the organization, particularly within the control system environment.\n\n- Asset owners need to be better prepared to handle this level of malware by practicing defense-in-depth,\ndeveloping appropriate logging procedures, practicing appropriate network monitoring, and knowing the\navailable resources for combating this type of event.\n\n- Timely information sharing of threats and analysis is of chief importance in empowering and protecting\npublic and private sector partners.\n\n\nADVANCED PERSISTENT THREAT (APT) ACTORS TARGET INDUSTRY\n\n\nAPT actors have been reported on for some time now; however, 2010 ushered in a new uptick in APT activity\naffecting organizations across all CIKR sectors. These sophisticated attacks difficult to defend against and in\nmany cases, difficult to detect and mitigate as APT actors are typically well-funded and organized. Advanced\nthreats take advantage of the human side of cybersecurity through social engineering and phishing e-mails to\nentice employees to open attachments or click links that download malware to their systems. In most cases,\nthese attacks focus on corporate espionage with the intent to gain competitive advantage in regional or global\nmarkets.\n\nIn 2010, ICS-CERT and US-CERT assisted numerous asset owners with APT-related activity. These incidents\ninvolved extensive coordination with asset owners and operators, including onsite engagements and law\nenforcement involvement (at the request of the organization) to identify compromised or systems of interest.\nWhile control systems are not the typical intended targets, ICS-CERT examines all pathways from the business\nnetwork to evaluate if a compromise has breached the control network. ICS-CERT and US-CERT also\nrecommend practices to help better secure the network and detect future malicious activity.\n\n**LESSONS LEARNED**\n\n- Asset owners and operators are susceptible to a variety of threat actors that appear to be increasing their\nactivities across all sectors.\n\n## ICS-CERT Year in Review – 2010 Page 2 of 7\n\n\n-----\n\n- An organization’s lack of established security practices introduces more attack vectors and generally makes\nit difficult to detect malicious activity and perform forensic analysis.\n\n- Spear phishing attacks are a common method of gaining footholds into corporate networks.\n\n- Organizations need to deploy better detection measures and evaluate all connections into their control\nnetworks.\n\n\nFLY-AWAY TEAMS DEPLOYED FOR ICS CYBER INCIDENTS\n\n\nAs mentioned, the uptick in malicious cyber activity resulted in the formation of teams that could deploy with\nlittle notice to help triage a cyber incident. Armed with toolkits, these fly-away teams were dispatched at the\nrequest of asset owners in response to actual incidents impacting ICS across various critical infrastructure\nsectors.\n\nThe majority of onsites involved a review of the incident details, enterprise network topologies and control\nsystems architectures for the purpose of identifying initial infection vectors, systems of interest, and weakened\nareas that need strengthening. Many of the asset owners also requested law enforcement/FBI coordination to\nfurther document and protect their assets.\n\nIn certain cases, and with the approval of the asset owners involved, ICS-CERT analyzed additional information\nsuch as malware, network traffic captures, and system images for more in-depth analysis and identification of\nmalicious activity. ICS-CERT provided follow-on reporting, mitigation measures, and access to additional\nresources through the US-CERT secure portal. These engagements fostered a new level of partnering and\ninformation sharing that will likely grow in 2011 and beyond.\n\n**LESSONS LEARNED**\n\n- Many asset owners reported that they were not aware of the resources available to keep them informed of\ncurrent threat information or vulnerabilities to ICS.\n\n- A common understanding of the potential impacts of cyber vulnerabilities (loss or degradation of process\ncontrol, loss of sensitive information, etc.) does not exist across all CIKR sectors.\n\n- Asset owners need to employ consistent management of privileges on their networks⎯ who has which\nprivileges and on which part of the network they apply for each individual.\n\n- Forensics analysis is enhanced when the organization has established a baseline dataset for network\nconfiguration and typical traffic; this allows for more effective identification of intrusions.\n\n- Asset owners need to develop adequate policies and procedures to educate employees and reduce the\npotential of unintended cyber incidents resulting from untrained workforce.\n\n\nRESPONSIBLE VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE\n\n\nDuring 2010, ICS-CERT worked with a variety of researchers to foster responsible vulnerability disclosure with\nICS vendors. Many researchers had begun viewing the control systems arena as an untapped area of focus for\nvulnerabilities and exploits and used their research to call attention to it. ICS-CERT, in coordination with\nCERT/CC and US-CERT, identified that a gap existed between the control systems research and vendor\ncommunities. ICS-CERT, CERT/CC and US-CERT were able to bridge this gap by reaching out to both parties\n\n## ICS-CERT Year in Review – 2010 Page 3 of 7\n\n\n-----\n\nand acting as a conduit for information sharing and vulnerability disclosure. This process has shown excellent\nresults for both the researchers and the vendors alike. ICS-CERT found that in most cases, vendors take\nsecurity issues with their software very seriously and prefer to see them mitigated in a coordinated manner to\nminimize the risk to their customers.\n\nDespite progress, some researchers continue to publicly disclose vulnerabilities without any coordination. ICS­\nCERT categorizes ICS vulnerability disclosure as one of two types:\n\n- Coordinated disclosure: the researcher reports the vulnerability to ICS-CERT or the vendor and delays\npublic disclosure until the vendor has released a patch and provided users time to apply the patch.\n\n- Unanticipated disclosure: the researcher publicly discloses the vulnerability without notifying any\ncoordinating groups or the vendor. In 2010, ICS-CERT saw a significant increase in the number of\nunanticipated disclosures of ICS vulnerabilities reported by independent researchers around the world.\n\nICS-CERT has coordinated vulnerability disclosures with CERT/CC, US-CERT, independent researchers,\nvendors, Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs) and national level CERTs throughout the world.\nICS-CERT also performs testing and verification of the vulnerabilities and patches when possible. This resulted\nin multiple Alerts and Advisories to warn of the vulnerabilities and provide mitigation paths and resources.\n\n**LESSONS LEARNED**\n\n- Independent researchers are valuable assets for improving control system cybersecurity.\n\n- Most ICS vendors take security issues with their software very seriously and prefer to see them mitigated in\na coordinated manner to minimize the risk to their customers.\n\n- Relationships with other national-level CERTs are as equally important for properly coordinating\nICS-related vulnerabilities for protecting the install base in other countries and for communicating with\nvendors headquartered out of foreign regions.\n\n\nUSB DRIVES AND OTHER REMOVABLE MEDIA\n\n\nEven before the advent of Stuxnet, ICS-CERT had begun to track a trend of removable media involved in\nmalware infections. In one fly-away deployment, an employee had attended an industry event and used an\ninstructor’s USB to download presentation materials to the company’s laptop. The USB was unknowingly\ninfected with the Mariposa botnet and when the employee returned to the work location and plugged the laptop\nin, the virus quickly spread to nearly 100 systems.\n\nICS-CERT encourages owners and operators to review the following documents:\n\n- ICS-CERT Control Systems Analysis Report, “USB Drives Commonly Used as an Attack Vector Against\nCritical Infrastructure”[a ]\n\n- ICS-CERT Advisory, “ICSA-10-238-01B⎯Stuxnet Malware Mitigation.”[b ]\n\na.
