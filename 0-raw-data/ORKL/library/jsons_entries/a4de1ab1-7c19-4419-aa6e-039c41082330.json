Influenced by the proliferation of smartphones and\ntablets, the use of wireless technology in industry has transformed work being performed and continues to\ngrow at a rapid pace. Wireless technology has great appeals to many manufacturers, for example, industrial\nautomation systems, which include process control, discrete manufacturing, and safety systems. Applying\nwireless technologies in new or existing industrial systems for monitoring and controlling equipment and\nprocesses eliminates costly cabling and enables configuration flexibility. In addition, using wireless\ntechnologies can improve plant-floor operating conditions, performance, and efficiency in emerging smart\nmanufacturing practices.\n\n\nWireless technology has been used in industry for many years, for example, the licensed bands, which have\nthe advantage of interference-free operation in general. It has provided years of reliable communications\nfor monitoring and controlling processes, where using cables is either too costly or impractical. When\ninterference is encountered, there is always legal recourse. In recent years, license-free wireless\ntechnologies based on the industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) radio frequency (RF) bands are\nproliferating and providing industry many options for solution choices, such as wireless networking for\nmobile workers and wireless sensor networks for process optimization and asset management. However,\nthe explosive growth of such technologies would cause potential interference problems. In addition,\nadoption and use of wireless technology has often been hampered by a perceived lack of reliability,\nintegrity, and security, especially when wireless communication is often corrupted or disrupted in harsh\nindustrial settings. So, which wireless technology is best for your application and what approach and\nprecautions should be taken to ensure reliable operation? Simply speaking, there is no one single solution\nfor wireless, since it depends on communication distance between devices, RF requirements, network\ntopology, communication protocol, data rate, network size, and amount of interference in the industrial\nenvironment. Thus, understanding the capabilities and applications of wireless technologies will allow\nusers to realize the benefits of wireless, while avoiding the problems of misapplication in challenging\nindustrial environments, in which many potential physical obstructions and sources of interference existed.\n\nThrough interactions with industry, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) researchers\nunderstood the need of an industrial wireless guideline document, which will help manufacturers, users,\nand their technology suppliers to design, assess, select, and deploy secure, wireless systems that can perform\ndependably in their factory settings and conditions. Thus, NIST organized a joint industrial wireless\nworkshop with IEEE on March 13, 2017[1]. The purpose of the workshop was to explore latest and future\nwireless technologies for establishing best practice guidelines to help manufacturers and users make\nconfident decisions in selecting and applying appropriate wireless technologies for their plants or factories\nbased on their operating requirements and environments. During the discussion, key elements, such as\nwireless technology categories and selection, spectrum selection and monitoring, radio frequency (RF)\nconcerns, tools, and methods for testing, and acceptance plan for deployment, etc., were intensely discussed\nand considered to be included in the guidelines document. At the end of the workshop, a consensus was\nreached for NIST to organize an ad-hoc working group with the aim to conduct monthly working group\nmeetings to develop a best-practice guidelines document to be published by NIST in September 2018. NIST\nannounced this effort in the Federal Register through “the formation of a technical working group (TWG)\nto develop best practices guidelines in selecting and deploying industrial wireless solutions within industrial\nenvironments, such as process control and discrete manufacturing. Guidelines will consider the entire\nwireless ecosystem within factories with emphasis on wireless networks operating on the factory floor. This\nincludes factory/plant instrumentation, control systems, and back-haul networks. The guidelines will be\n\n\n-----\n\ntechnology and vendor agnostic and will address the current needs of industry to have independent\nguidelines based on user requirements and measurement science research. Volunteers from industry joined\nthe TWG. Through the dedicated work of the TWG members, this document “Guide to Industrial Wireless\nSystems Deployments” is thus created for industry to use. This document is intended to be a practical guide\nused by engineers and managers facilitating them to go through the process of defining the objectives of\ntheir wireless systems and examining the environments where the wireless systems are to be deployed, then\nhelping them in selecting, designing, deploying, and monitoring the wireless systems using existing\ntechnology in a factory. Sufficient background materials about wireless technologies are provided, so that\nthe users have a basic understanding of wireless systems being addressed. Thus, the document is aimed to\nbe a succinct, easy-to-use, reference guide, equipped with checklists throughout the lifecycle of wireless\ntechnology from concept and design to deployment and monitoring.\n\n###### 1.2 Purpose and Scope\nThe purpose of the document is to provide best-practice guidelines for an integrated methodology that aims\nto enable, assess, and assure the real-time performance of secure wireless systems in smart manufacturing\nsystems. These guidelines also aim to enable users, manufacturers, technology providers, and solution\nproviders to design, select, deploy, configure, and assess robust, safe, reliable, and secure integrated\nwireless systems, with consideration of any co-existence and interference avoidance issues in smart\nmanufacturing systems. This document will only address existing wireless technologies used in industrial\nenvironments. Advanced wireless technologies are outside the scope of the document. A revision of the\ndocument may be warranted when new and relevant wireless standards and technologies are adopted and\nused in industry.\n\n###### 1.3 Intended Audience\nThis document is intended to be used as a practical guide by control engineers, operational technology\nprofessionals, information technology professionals, chief executives, security executives, factory floor\nmanagers, and wireless system integrators interested in deploying wireless systems in industrial\nenvironments.\n\n###### 1.4 Document Organization\nThe guidelines document is organized as follows:\n\n\n\n- An introduction of the document including an executive summary, purpose and scope, intended\naudience, and the organization of the document are presented in Chapter 1.\n\n- An introduction to industrial wireless including different wireless technologies and networking\nbasics, as well as radio frequency consideration, wireless terminology, spectrum selection and\napplicability, and various technical challenges for wireless, such as latency and reliability, are\naddressed in Chapter 2.\n\n- Business cases for wireless with consideration of the purposes for initiating wireless systems is\nbriefly discussed in Chapter 3.\n\n- A total wireless lifecycle from the objective of choosing wireless to factory survey to candidate\nselection to wireless policy to deployment to network security and spectrum monitoring are\nextensively discussed in Chapter 4.\n\n- Wireless for safety operations and related standard(s) are discussed in Chapter 5.\n\n- Industrial wireless security is very important and it should be carefully deployed to protect\nindustrial systems from hacking or attacks. So industrial wireless security issues, practical\nconsiderations, and guidelines and standards are addressed in Chapter 6.\n\n\n-----\n\n- Best wireless practice considerations such as antenna placement, obstructions, path redundancy,\nshadowing, metal canyons, and RF interference problems are discussed in Chapter 7.\n\n- Various checklists to help wireless systems deployment, such as the Sample Defining Objectives\nChecklist, Sample Factory Survey Checklist, Sample Candidate Selection Process Checklist,\nSample Candidate Requirements Matrix, Sample Wireless Design Checklist, and Sample\nWireless Systems Deployment Checklist, are provided in Appendix A.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 2 INDUSTRIAL WIRELESS FUNDAMENTALS\n\n 2.1 Industrial Control Systems\nIndustrial systems are those systems that employ machinery to accomplish a set of tasks to produce products\nor provide a service. Industrial control system (ICS) is a general term that encompasses several types of\ncontrol systems and associated instrumentation used in industrial technology[2]. This includes supervisory\ncontrol and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, distributed control systems (DCS), human-machine\ninterfaces (HMI), and other smaller control system configurations such as programmable logic controllers\n(PLC) and microcontrollers often found in the industrial sectors. Industrial systems can be categorized into\ndifferent types of systems based on the speed of production or the characteristic of materials and flow.\n\nIndustrial systems may be categorized as flow-based, batch-based, or job-based systems. A flow-based\nsystem, also called a continuous process, include systems such as oil refineries (Figure 1) and water\ntreatment. Job-based systems, also called discrete manufacturing systems, include the manufacture of\nmachines or products in discrete steps. An aircraft assembly line is an example of a discrete system. Batchsystem may be considered a hybrid of discrete and continuous processes. Food production is an example\nof a batch process. Continuous, discrete, and batch manufacturing processes are quite different in their\nphysical properties, construction, and locality. Continuous processes are often referred to as plants while\ndiscrete processes are referred to as factories. Herein, we use the terms plant and factory interchangeably.\n\n\nFigure 1. Example of a Continuous Process with liquid or vapor material flow\n\nbetween vessels.\n\n\n-----\n\n|Application OPC Control Data Engineering Workstations Servers Servers Server Historian Workstation DB|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|Crane Light curtain Machine Light Tower HMI Inventory Unmanned PLC SIS ESTOP Storage Vehicle Mobile Devices||\n\n\nServer\n\n\nFigure 2. Simplified Discrete Manufacturing Process\n\n\nContinuous processes include oil refineries as shown in Figure 1, pipelines, chemical plants, water\npurification, and waste water processes. Materials in continuous processes are typically liquid or gas and\nundergo heating, cooling, compression, and extraction. Process variables include temperature, pressure,\nflow, and container level. Actuation typically regards setting of a set-point, speed control of a machine, or\n\ncontrolling flow of material through a valve.\n\n\nFigure 3. Discrete manufacturing process\nwith robot workers, sensors, and actuators.\n\n\nFigure 2 illustrates a simplified discrete manufacturing\nprocess. Factories will often divide the operation into\nzones and conduits as described in the industrial\nautomation cyber-security (IACS) standard publication\nInternational Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)\n62443[3]. Discrete manufacturing operations are\ndivided into the factory floor, a factory data center, the\ncorporate business enterprise, and finally third-party\ninternet or cloud services. The factory floor is then subdivided into work-cells shown in Figure 3 where\nspecific tasks are performed. In advanced\nmanufacturing operations, work-cells may have\nreconfigurable purpose for a dynamic task schedule.\nWithin the factory, wireless may be used in place of\n\n\n-----\n\nwires for applications such as input-output (IO) instrumentation, command and control actuation, personnel\nsafety, security and surveillance, asset and vehicle tracking, and back-haul connectivity to the factory data\ncenter. By deploying wireless intelligently, factory engineers may better achieve their objectives.\nInstrumentation within a discrete manufacturing process tends to include ON/OFF sensors such as limit\nswitches, counters, ON/OFF actuators, and communication links carrying command control information\nfor robotic workers. Process information is carried from the work-cells to a centralized data center for\nadditional control decisions and analytics.\n\n###### 2.2 Wireless Technology\nIndustrial wireless networks (IWNs) are a key enabler of many aspects of advanced manufacturing. IWNs\npromise lower installation costs compared with wired alternatives, increased operational flexibility,\nimproved factory visibility, and enhanced mobility. Wireless networks are not dissimilar to wired networks\nwith the key exception being the transmission medium. Wired networks typically operate over copper\nwires, coaxial cable, or fiber optic cable depending on the network type. Wireless networks operate without\nwires or cables using the electromagnetic propagation. As such, wireless networks operate within a shared\nmedium that is publicly accessible. A listing of wireless technologies is given in Table 1.\n\nTable 1. List of Currently Prevalent Wireless Technologies\n\n|Domain|Description|\n|---|---|\n|Home and Office|This includes standards-based communications system typically found in the office environment but may be useful for the factory. Includes IEEE 802.11[4] variants and Wi-Fi compliant devices. Bluetooth also falls into this category.|\n|Instrumentation|Includes systems specifically designed for factory operation. IEEE 802.15.4[5] standards such as International Society of Automation (ISA) 100.11a, WirelessHART (IEC 62591:2016), IEC 62601, and ZigBee fall into this category[6]. High-performance standards built on IEEE 802.11 include the Wireless Networks for Industrial Automation - Factory Automation (WIA-FA) IEC 62948[7]. Many exceptional proprietary options exist as well.|\n|Wide Area Sensing|Some applications require the ability to transmit over long distances with minimal power to conserve battery life for sensing and control over wide geographical distances. Examples include LoRaWAN and Sigfox as well as modes of 4G and 5G cellular radio standards.|\n|Other commercial|This category includes systems such as satellite, cellular, directional microwave data links, optical (visible light), and land-mobile radio. This category includes technologies supporting video and voice communication.|\n|Tailored solutions|Includes technologies such as radiating coaxial cable and tropo-scatter solutions that are designed for mission criteria that have unique requirements and require a solution that cannot be met with off-the-shelf alternatives.|\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 2.3 Wireless Networking Basics\n\n2.3.1 Radio Frequency Communication\nRadio frequency (RF) communication is used to describe any form of communication that uses\nelectromagnetic spectrum extending from 3 kHz to 300 GHz. Most communications occur between 300\nMHz and 6 GHz. The term RF is used synonymously with the term “wireless” although they can have\nsubtle differences in meaning. In RF communication, oscillating electrical current is shaped per the\ninformation being transmitted. It is then\nconverted into electric and magnetic\nfields which propagate together as waves\nin the surrounding medium which is\nusually air or vacuum.\n\nRF energy will not penetrate easily into\nconductive materials but will form\nshallow eddies that reflect most of the\nenergy back into space. Non-conductive\nmaterials will usually absorb RF energy\nthereby causing attenuation. Some\nmaterials such as wood and dry-wall will Figure 4. Spectral activity in the 2.4 GHz ISM Band\nallow RF energy to penetrate through.\nThis effect is common within wood housing and offices which is why home routers work well. Liquids\nincluding fog are significant absorbers as are leaves and trees. Absorption properties depend on the\nfrequency of transmission. In general, lower frequency RF waves penetrate walls and lose energy slower\nthan high frequency RF waves. To receive RF energy, an antenna is required to collect the energy and\nconvert that energy into electrical current which can then be processed electronically and converted into\nusable data.\n\nRF energy can be visualized using standard test equipment such as a spectrum analyzer. A spectrum\nanalyzer displays RF power versus frequency. Shown in Figure 4 is a capture of activity in the 2.4 GHz\nindustrial, scientific, and medical radio (ISM) band. In this capture, Wi-Fi activity exists in the standard\nchannels supporting file transfer, video, and voice communications. Activity from wireless sensor\ninstrumentation also exists producing narrowband frequency hopping transmissions. Since both\ntransmissions co-exist in the same RF band, these devices may interfere with each other. Other devices\nsuch as cell phones with active 2.4 GHz\nhot spots and microwave ovens could\nalso contribute to interference. Object Object\n\nreflection reflection J\n\nObjects within the surrounding\nenvironment determine the behavior of absorption\n\nTX RX\n\nthe waves as they propagate through the\nenvironment. Shown in Figure 5 is a\n\ndiffraction\n\nsimplified model of a radio channel.\n\n_distance_\n\nWhen RF energy is transmitted, it will\ntravel in the direction determined by the Figure 5. Wireless range, obstructions, absorption, reflection,\nantenna gain pattern. Objects in the diffraction, jamming.\nenvironment may obstruct, attenuate, or\nreflect RF energy. Reflections contribute to a phenomenon known as multi-path.  Edges of objects may\nalso result in diffraction even if a line-of-sight (LOS) path exists. Refer to the explanation of the First\nFresnel Zone in Section 7.1. At the receiver end, direct path and reflected energy is detected and decoded\n\n\nJ\n\n\n-----\n\ninto useful information if the signal energy was high enough to overcome naturally and artificially occurring\nnoise and interference. Multi-path reflections may result in significant interference and information loss\neven if signal power is high.\n\n2.3.2 RF Considerations\nThe following terms and definitions will help the reader to better understand the vocabulary used in wireless\ntechnology and have a stronger understanding of wireless networking considerations.\n\n_2.3.2.1_ _General Concepts and Definitions_\n**Antenna – A device that converts electrical energy into propagating electromagnetic waves or the reverse.**\n\n**Antenna Polarity – The orientation of the directionality of electromagnetic waves produced by an antenna.**\nCommon polarities are vertical, horizontal, and circular. Receive antennas should be oriented such that its\npolarity matches that of the transmitting antenna polarity.\n\n**Bandwidth – The amount of spectrum occupied by a signal. For example, a standard IEEE 802.11g**\ntransmission will use a nominal 22 MHz of bandwidth. An IEEE 802.15.4 transmission on which ZigBee,\nWirelessHART, and ISA100 Wireless are designed will use a nominal 5 MHz of bandwidth.\n\n**Carrier – A single frequency sinusoidal signal represented by a vertical line or spike in frequency.**\n\n\n**Channel – A term used to identify a physical communications link and includes the characteristics of the**\nentire path of information flow from transmitter to receiver. A channel is defined by electrical and\nelectromagnetic characteristics of the transmission medium such as bandwidth and distortions.\n\n**Interference – RF power, typically in the RF band of interest, that disrupts communications by inhibiting**\nthe ability of a receiver to decode a transmission. Sources of interference could include anything that\nradiates electromagnetic (EM) energy such as machinery and undesirable radio devices.\n\n**Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) – Ratio of signal power to naturally occurring emissions such as thermal**\nnoise and cosmic background radiation. Maximizing SNR is the primary goal of wireless communications.\n\n**Signal-to-Noise-And-Interference Ratio (SNIR) – Ratio of signal power to the sum of naturally occurring**\nnoise power and interference power. Minimizing the contribution of interference to SNIR is an important\ngoal of a wireless communications system.\n\n**Power Decibels – A logarithmic representation of a voltage or power relative to a reference. Power is**\n\nconverted to decibels by the equation _P_  10log10 _p_ . The notation dBW and dBm represent power levels\n\nrelative to 1 Watt and 1 milliwatt, respectively. The notation dB denotes a ratio of two numbers and should\nnot be used to denote power.\n\n**Link Budget – Calculations that predict the probability that a transmission will be successfully detected**\nand decoded by the receiver. A link budget will account for transmission power, signal formatting, noise,\nsignal distortions, interference, receiver characteristics, and the link reliability requirements.\n\n**Link Margin – The difference in decibels (dB) between the ability of a receiver to successfully receive a**\ntransmission and the expected minimum received power. A link margin of 10 dB indicates that a signal\ncould be attenuated by an additional factor of 10 before it can no longer be received. A link margin should\naccommodate reasonable unexpected attenuations, distortions, and interference not directly addressed by\nthe link budget.\n\n_2.3.2.2_ _Transmitter Concepts and Definitions_\n**Transmitter – The device responsibility for transmitting information wirelessly.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Transmit Power – the average amount of RF energy per unit power emitted by the transmit antenna. This**\nis typically specified in Watts, dBW, or dBm.\n\n**Bit Rate – The average or peak amount of data transmitted during an interval of time. This is represented**\nas bits per second (bps).\n\n**Duty Cycle – The percentage at which a transmitter is active.**\n\n\n**Modulation – The method by which information is used to modify the behavior of an RF carrier. Different**\nmodulations exist such as amplitude modulation (AM), frequency modulation (FM), and phase modulation\n(PM). Digital modulations are discrete versions of the above modulations. Common modulations used in\nindustrial communications include binary phase shift keying (BPSK), quadrature phase shift keying\n(QPSK), and quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), among others. Wi-Fi uses a combination of BPSK,\nQPSK, and QAM depending on channel quality.\n\n**Error Control Coding (ECC) – A method to increase reliability of a communications link by adding data**\nredundancy that can detect and correct errors produced by the channel. ECC increases the amount of\nbandwidth requirements or decreasing the amount of useful information over a channel.\n\n**Frequency Hopping (FH) – A process by which the carrier frequency is changed during or between**\ntransmissions accordingly to a pre-defined synchronized method. With FH, transmitter and receiver must\ntune to the same frequency at precisely the same time. FH hopping adds a layer of complexity to a system\nbut also makes interception or disruption of the wireless system more difficult, thereby making the system\nmore reliable.\n\n**Spread Spectrum – A process of spreading RF energy beyond what is needed to transmit information for**\nthe purpose of improved medium access, better interference immunity, or minimization of signal detection.\n\n**Payload – The information being transmitted. The size of the payload factors into transmission duration.**\nAll communication systems have a limit to the size of a payload before fragmentation is required. Not all\ncommunication systems support fragmentation. At the lowest layers of a communication system, the\npayload includes all data encoding and framing.\n\n_2.3.2.3_ _Receiver Concepts_\n**Receiver – The device responsible for decoding incoming transmissions in accordance with an established**\nprotocol.\n\n**Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) – A measurement of received signal power.**\n\n\n**Received Signal Quality Indicator (RSQI) – A measurement of the quality of the received signal**\n\n**Sensitivity – The minimum signal strength, SNR, or SNIR required by a receiver to decode an incoming**\ntransmission.\n\n**Adjacent Channel Interference (ACI) – RF energy that is adjacent to the channel containing a desired**\nsignal.\n\n\n**Adjacent Channel Rejection (ACR) – The ability of the receiver to suppress ACI.**\n\n**Dynamic Range – The difference between the maximum and minimum received signal power. A large**\ndynamic range is particularly helpful in accommodating strong ACI that leaks past RF filtering.\n\n**Selectivity – The ability of a device to decode a transmission on one frequency without interference from**\ntransmissions on other frequencies.\n\n\n-----\n\n_2.3.2.4_ _Electromagnetic Interference_\nElectromagnetic interference (EMI) is always present to some degree in a wireless network. EMI when in\nthe radio frequency spectrum creates a disturbance that disrupts intended communications. The disturbance\ncan degrade performance by introducing RF energy into the circuits of wireless devices. When the\ndisturbance is strong enough to overcome the intended signal, communication loss will result. Sources of\nEMI include both man-made and natural sources. Natural radio sources typically will not interfere with\nnetwork operation as the devices or deployment locations are designed to accommodate some natural\ninterference. Man-made interference can include other competing radio devices that operate in the same\nfrequency band or nearby in frequency. Noise from rotating electrical motors can also occur and typically\naffects radio bands below 400 MHz. Common interference sources include personal devices such as cellphones in which the Wi-Fi hotspot is enabled. It can also include non-communication devices such as\nmicro-wave ovens. EMI can also emanate from intentional radio jammers designed to disrupt\ncommunications.\n\n_2.3.2.5_ _Human Wireless Exposure_\nWireless emissions exposure is a recognized concern. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and\nHealth (NIOSH) conducts research on protecting workers from proven and possible EMF health risks due\nto exposure to radio frequency and other types of emissions. The International Commission on NonIonizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) of the World Health Organization (WHO) also publishes guidance\non radio frequency radiation exposure limits. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) posted\nOET BULLETIN 56 [8], “Questions and Answers about Biological Effects and Potential Hazards of\nRadiofrequency Electromagnetic Fields” which was last updated in 1999. This bulletin, outlines maximum\npermissible levels of exposure for occupational controlled exposure and uncontrolled exposure.\n\n2.3.3 Networking Considerations\nMost networking systems are built upon a layered architecture called the Open Systems Interconnect (OSI)\nmodel [9]. Functional layers within the OSI model serve a logical purpose to facilitate a communication\nservice and are shown in Table 2. In a wireless network, layers 1 and 2 of the protocol stack includes all\nthe framing, medium access, error correction coding, modulation, and transmission of a signal. Above\nthose layers are the layers used for logical addressing, connection establishment, and retransmission in case\nof errors. Layer 2 is responsible for hardware level addressing and framing. The medium access control\n(MAC) address is used by Layer 2. The network layer, Layer 3, is responsible for logical addressing,\nrouting, and traffic control. For protocols such as Wi-Fi, the Internet Protocol (IP) addresses are used in\nLayer 3. IP addresses are then associated with MAC addresses.\n\nTable 2. OSI Network Protocol Model\n\n\n# Layer Protocol Data Unit Purpose\n7 Application Data High-level interfaces or applications\n6 Presentation Network to application encoding\n5 Session Management of data exchange\n4 Transport Segment/Datagram Connection and reliability between nodes\n3 Network Packet Addressing, routing, traffic control\n2 Data Link Frame Physical addressing and framing\n1 Physical Bit Transmission and reception of raw signals\nPhysical Medium (air, space, waveguide, etc.)\n\nLayers 5 and 6 are not always necessary and may be combined with higher layers. Layer 7, the Application\nlayer, serves as the interface to the functions of the system that use wireless communication service. It\n\n|#|Layer|Protocol Data Unit|Purpose|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|7|Application|Data|High-level interfaces or applications|\n|6|Presentation||Network to application encoding|\n|5|Session||Management of data exchange|\n|4|Transport|Segment/Datagram|Connection and reliability between nodes|\n|3|Network|Packet|Addressing, routing, traffic control|\n|2|Data Link|Frame|Physical addressing and framing|\n|1|Physical|Bit|Transmission and reception of raw signals|\n|Physical Medium (air, space, waveguide, etc.)||||\n\n\n-----\n\nincludes an application programming interface (API) that allows programs to access the protocol stack. In\na wireless sensor, for example, all functional elements would be implemented to connect to a network,\ntransmit sensor readings, receive commands, manage reliability, and maintain connections. A\nmicrocontroller or processor within the wireless sensor device would access the wireless network through\nthe Application Layer API.\n\nA network logically consists of nodes and logical connections or edges between the nodes. Depending on\nthe design of the network, nodes can be organized into different topologies. A topology defines how nodes\nwithin a network are arranged. Shown in Figure 6 are various network topologies including a peer-to-peer\n(P2P) single hop, P2P multi-hop, star, and mesh topologies. A single-hop P2P topology is used for directed\ncommunications between two nodes. A microwave link between two buildings or a link between a tank\nfarm and central office are examples of a single-hop topology. A multi-hop topology is an extension of\nsingle-hop where distance between nodes is a concern and additional range is required.\n\nMore complex topologies include the star topology and the mesh topology. Star topologies also known as\n“hub and spoke” are designed to have a central mediator such as an access point in a home/office wireless\nnetwork. Through the star topology, nodes can communicate together through the central node. The central\nnode in a star topology coordinates communication within the network. In mesh topologies, nodes within\nthe network can communicate directly with other nodes without the need for a central node. Star topology\nnetworks typically have better delay determinism than mesh networks because the hopping is determined\nbefore deployment. An example of a star topology industrial wireless network is ISA100.11a. Wi-Fi and\nother IEEE 802.11 variants are also usually star topology networks by default.\n\nA mesh network will have better reliability because data may be routed through alternate nodes in the\nnetwork, but it achieves this reliability at the expense of deterministic delay. Mesh networks can be\nconfigured to have deterministic latency under normal operating circumstances. Examples of mesh\nnetworks are WirelessHART and ZigBee. The ISA100.11a network can be configured to behave as a mesh,\n\n(a) single hop (b) multi-hop\n\n\n(c) star pattern (d) mesh\n\nFigure 6. Illustrations of different network topologies.\n\n\n-----\n\nbut it’s default is the star topology to ensure reliability and latency determinism. A Wi-Fi network can also\nbe configured as a mesh network.\n\nOther important considerations for the wireless network are now discussed. These considerations have\nimpacts on the selection, deployment, and maintenance of the network and should be considered carefully.\n\n**Addressing – How the network identifies nodes. An address is a unique identifier that the network uses to**\nestablish connections and route information. The addressing scheme used by a network will limit the\nnumber of devices that the wireless system can support.\n\n**Naming – A human-readable identifier for a node or device within a network. Addressing the network**\nmay support identification that would be useful for a human\nto identify a device within the network.\n\n\n**Network Throughput – The amount of useful information**\nthat can traverse the network within a finite amount of time.\nThroughput must be measured as useful information;\ntherefore, a specification of throughput should not include\nnetwork overhead such as packet headers and\nacknowledgements. Throughput within a wireless network\nwill depend greatly on the conditions of the network and the\ntopology of the network. Single routing points such as what\nis shown in Figure 7 can become stress points within a\nnetwork limiting throughput under changing RF conditions\nand can also be a single point of failure as one node will be\nthe conduit for one section of the network.\n\n**Number of Devices – A wireless network will have a limit**\nin the number of devices that it can support. More devices\non the network will have an impact on the reporting rates\nthat are possible and may contribute to self-interference\ndepending on the type of network used.\n\n\nBottleneck and\npoint of failure\n\nFigure 7. Illustrations of a network\n\n\nbottleneck at a single router node.\n\n\n**Reliability – In a wireless network, reliability is a measure of the probability that a logical data path**\nbetween a source and destination within a network, such as a sensor and a PLC, is available such that data\nwill be received by its intended recipient within specified time constraints. This should not be confused\nwith metrics associated with low-level packet transmissions within the network such as packet error rate.\nReliability within an industrial network is a measure of likelihood that information will be guaranteed to be\nreceived by an intended consumer on-time. For example, a proximity sensor reading within a mesh network\ncould be delivered within a 100ms deadline to a PLC for feedback control with 99.999% success.\nReliability is one of the most important factors in a automation and control networks\n\n**Latency – In general, latency is the time that it takes for data to travel from its source to its destination.**\nFor industrial sensing applications, this is more aptly defined as the time delay from when a measurement\nis taken and delivered to its intended recipient. For industrial actuation and control, it is the time from when\na command is issued to when it is received by its intended recipient and action begins. Latency in an\nindustrial system includes the physical measurement and actuation process.\n\n**Encryption – A method used to encode data to prevent unauthorized access to the data. Encryption is**\nimportant to protecting intellectual property information that may be construed by observing data traversing\na factory network. While a wireless network utilizes the electromagnetic spectrum, which is an open natural\nresource, this does not mean that data is not secure. Like wired networks, wireless networks can employ\n\n\n-----\n\nstrong encryption which defends against unauthorized data access. It is important then to verify that the\nlevel of encryption that a candidate wireless network uses will meet the needs of the security risk level of\nthe factory.\n\n**Authentication – A method used to validate that a device or user is authorized to gain network access and**\nthat the source of data is genuine. Authentication is an important aspect of factory security linked to process\navailability and can be more important than encryption. Devices within a network should be authenticated.\nWireless networks should support device authentication. Management services supporting the network\nshould support user authentication. User passwords should be updated regularly and default passwords\nshould never be used.\n\n**Key management – The set of management tools, protocols, and procedures for updating keys for devices**\nin the field and those already deployed. Some systems require keys to be loaded by physically touching\nthe device whereas other systems can perform this task remotely through a service called over-the-air\nrekeying (OTAR). When a device is deployed, it may be impractical and costly to locate the device and\nsend personnel to the device to load new keys. A wireless system that supports OTAR capabilities will\nimprove the maintainability of the system.\n\n**Over-the-air programming (OTAP) – A capability that allows a device or devices to be reconfigured or**\nreprogrammed once it is deployed. Like OTAR, new configuration parameters for devices such as a change\nin reporting rate would be made easier with OTAP. Intelligent devices that can be reprogrammed with new\nsoftware may also use OTAP capabilities to make deployment of the software easier.\n\n**Over-the-air-rekeying (OTAR) – A capability in which data signal encryption \"code\" keys are updated**\nin secure information systems by conveying the keys through encrypted wireless communication channels.\n\n**Power Source – The source of electrical power. In some plants and factories, power is easily accessible,**\nand in some access to power is limited. The type of power greatly determines the capabilities of the wireless\nsystem and devices. If a wired power source is available, it should be used instead of batteries as batteries\nrequire periodic replacement. Batteries are useful as a backup to wired power sources especially for\nmission-critical applications.  Other sources of power include solar power and piezoelectric power from\nvibrations. Solar power is a good way of powering wireless devices if ample light is available and dust in\nthe environment does not cover the solar cells over time.\n\n**Reboot/Reorganization Time – This is the amount of time that it takes to reboot all network devices that**\nhave lost power and to re-establish the network. After power is re-established, it takes time for devices to\nboot and for connections to be made. Some wireless systems will take seconds to reconnect a device to the\nnetwork. Other systems could take minutes per device which could lead to hours for all devices in a power\noutage where key devices such as a router or gateway lose power. This concern exemplifies the need for\nstable and reliable power sources. Under extreme situations, an RF interferer could cause the same type of\nnetwork condition if the interference is powerful enough and persists for a long time. Each wireless system\nhas strengths and weaknesses in this area, and systems should be carefully evaluated against mission\nobjectives before being deployed.\n\n**Intrinsic Safety – A protection technique for safe operation of electrical equipment in hazardous areas by**\nlimiting the energy, electrical and thermal, available for ignition. Areas with dangerous concentrations of\nflammable gases or dust are found in applications such as petrochemical refineries and mines. Wireless\ndevices may be labeled with an intrinsic safety rating. Intrinsic safety is defined by The National Fire\nProtection Association (NFPA) 70E Standard for Electrical Safety in the Workplace[10].\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 2.4 Wireless Applicability and Technical Challenges\nWireless has many advantage over wired installations, and it has many challenges. Applications of factory\nwireless can include process monitoring, condition alarming, product and asset tracking, supervisory\ncontrol, and feedback control. Use of wireless will depend on expected cost savings over wired options\nand the technical requirements of the application. Technical requirements can often be linked to the\nmobility, latency, loss, and scale constraints. Table 3 lists the latency, loss, and scale requirements of\ntypical classes of industrial applications[11]. Note that while this table lists typical constraints, every\napplication is different. Constraints can vary and easily exceed the limits specified in the table. Users must\nunderstand the requirements of their respective systems before embarking on any wireless enhancement.\nLatency here refers to the time difference between when an event is sensed and when it is received by\nanother actor within the system. Loss is a measure of how well events are communicated on time within a\nsystem. Packet error rate can be used to describe loss but should not be confused with loss since loss is an\nend-to-end measure that includes more than the communication system. Scale is a count of the number of\nnodes on the network. Networks have limitations on the number of supported nodes. It is also important\nto acknowledge that more nodes can mean slower reporting rates which impact latency.\n\nTable 3. List of Typical Network Reliability and Latency Requirements for Industrial Systems\n\n\n**_Application Class_** **_Latency,_** _l_ **_Pr. Loss,_** _r_ **_Devices,_** _s_\n\n_Monitoring_ _l _ 1s _r_  105 _s 10000_\n\n_Supervisory Control_\n\n_Flow-based_ _l 100_ ms _r_  106 _s _ 30\n\n_Job-based_ _l 100_ ms _r_  107 _s _ 10\n\n_Feedback Control_\n\n_Flow-based_ _l _ 10 s _r_  106 _s _ 1000\n\n_Job-based_ _l 10_ ms _r_  107 _s _ 10\n\n_Safety Alarming_ _l_  1s _r_  107 _s _ 10\n\nSince the electromagnetic spectrum otherwise known as the radio frequency (RF) spectrum is a publicly\naccessible yet a limited natural resource, special consideration must be placed on the selection of the RF\noperating band for any wireless deployment. These considerations include spectrum availability,\nbandwidth, impacts on distance and propagation, sources of interference, and security concerns. A table of\nwireless applicability is given in Table 8 in Appendix B. The reader is encouraged to consult this table for\nguidance when selecting a technology for their application.\n\n|Application Class|Latency, l|Pr. Loss, r|Devices, s|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Monitoring|l 1s|r 105|s 10000|\n|Supervisory Control Flow-based Job-based|l 100ms l 100ms|r 106 r 107|s 30 s 10|\n|Feedback Control Flow-based Job-based|l 10s l 10ms|r 106 r 107|s 1000 s 10|\n|Safety Alarming|l 1s|r 107|s 10|\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 2.5 Electromagnetic Spectrum Governance\nThe electromagnetic spectrum (EM) is a limited\nnatural resource. Of the possible frequency bands\navailable for use, only a fraction of spectrum is\navailable for legal commercial use. Within the\nUnited States, the electromagnetic spectrum is\nregulated by the Federal Communications\nCommission (FCC) and the National\nTelecommunications and Information\nAdministration (NTIA). The FCC has authority\nover non-federal communications while the NTIA\nis concerned with federal communications. Use of\nthe electromagnetic spectrum will require\nauthorization in some form from either of the two\n\nFigure 8. United States radio spectrum frequency\n\nagencies. Radio frequency allocations [12] for the\n\nallocations chart.\n\nUnited States is shown in Figure 8. For most\nindustrial establishments, FCC authorization is\nincluded in the system being procured. For federal industrial establishments, NTIA authorization is\nrequired to operate in a licensed band.\n\n2.5.1 Licensing\nUse of the EM spectrum is divided into two categories, licensed and unlicensed spectrum. Licensed\nspectrum requires FCC authorization for each specific use or device. Unlicensed spectrum such as the\nindustrial, scientific, and medical radio (ISM) band is deemed a public resource and includes the 902 to 928\nMHz, 2.400 to 2.4835 GHz, and 5.725 to 5.875 GHz radio bands. Industrial wireless devices typically\noperate over these unlicensed bands. While many wireless systems are designed to operate over the ISM\nbands, the systems will be subjected to the interference from other devices using the bands. Licensed\nspectrum has fewer wireless systems options, but it provides a better guarantee of available spectrum to\noperate devices without interference from others wireless systems.\n\nCoordination with bordering nations is required for licensed RF applications in proximity to those borders.\nFurthermore, all devices operating within the United States including those purchased from a foreign source\nmust have an FCC identifier. An FCC ID is a unique identifier assigned to a device registered with the\nUnited States Federal Communications Commission. For legal sale of wireless devices in the United States,\nwireless device manufacturers must have the device evaluated by an independent laboratory to ensure it\nconforms to FCC standards.\n\n2.5.2 RF Spectrum Planning and Internal Governance\nUse of licensed and unlicensed RF bands are regulated by the FCC; however, it is advisable that\norganizations track and manage their use of the RF spectrum beyond what is required by the FCC. Tracking\nof wireless devices and networks in terms of their spectral usage will help the organization plan for\ndeployments, manage growth, identify interference sources, and avoid network conflicts. Use of licensed\nbands may help to avoid interference, but all RF bands have limited capacity resources, and, hence, planning\nis important for its effective use. Having a method for internal governance within a factory enterprise is an\nessential part of a factory spectrum planning and monitoring strategy. Internal governance should be\nimplemented as a governing board with managers and engineers that agree on the short-term and long-term\nstrategies for use of the EM spectrum within the proximity and confines of their operations. The internal\ngovernance should account for the long-term vision of wireless deployments within the factory.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 3 BUSINESS CASE FOR WIRELESS\n\nOne of the key enablers of factory automation is the availability of wireless radio frequency devices. Some\napplications of radio frequency devices include process control, oil and gas refineries, pharmaceuticals,\nfood and beverage, autonomous guided vehicles (AGVs) control, slotted microwave guides, pendants to\ncontrol cranes and machine tools, active and passive radio frequency identifier (RFID) for tracking parts,\ntools and consumables, wireless barcode readers, remote sensing of critical process parameters, mobile\ntelephony, door openers, emergency communication, and general factory Wi-Fi for internet connectivity.\nIn addition, devices not directly associated with the manufacturing process such as microwave ovens and\nmobile telephone hot spots must be included when designing a factory wireless system. As useful as\nwireless communications is, it must be recognized that spectrum is limited and there must be judicious\nchoices about when it should be used, and when wired connections are preferable.\n\n\nIn general terms, wireless (as with any upgrade to a factory or enterprise system) should satisfy a\nrequirement related to quality, reliability, efficiency, safety, regulation, or environment as shown in Table\n4. The requirements pertain to the business enterprise which in the case of a manufacturing operation means\nthe plant or factory. A wireless deployment should be designed to satisfy one of the key business concerns\nlisted.\n\nTable 4. Purposes for initiating a wireless systems deployment\n\n|Functionality|Is wireless required to achieve an aspect of function within the factory operation? For example, does the factory require a mobility to achieve a goal?|\n|---|---|\n|Reliability|Is reliability of the production line improved? The ability to manufacture products, parts or assemblies which conform to the engineering definition, and can demonstrate conformity.|\n|Safety|Are people or equipment made safer? The ability of employees to perform their jobs free from recognized hazards including falls, hazardous energy, confined space, ergonomics, and hazardous materials, and being able to demonstrate compliance with all safety regulations.|\n|Efficiency|The ability to meet target costs and continue forever to reduce unit production costs.|\n|Quality|The ability to manufacture parts and assemblies which conform to the engineering definition, and be able to demonstrate conformity.|\n|Environment|Will the environment be better protected or accidents be avoided?|\n|Regulation|The ability to demonstrate compliance with applicable government regulations at the city, county, state, and federal level.|\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 4 WIRELESS LIFECYCLE\n\nSelecting an industrial wireless network (IWN) for factory deployment requires careful attention to\nplanning and design as well as deployment strategies and monitoring. And IWN must meet the needs for\nthe functional operation of the plant or factory and satisfy the long term operational goals of the\norganization.\n\nShown in Figure 9 is the generalized lifecycle of a wireless system deployment. Once a need for a\nnetworking solution is identified and wireless is deemed a worthwhile solution to consider, several steps\nshould be undertaken from the time that the need is identified to the time in which a wireless system is\ndeployed. The following sections defined the process guidelines for a wireless systems deployment. It\nshould not be construed as a formal change management process that would replace an existing and wellestablished process within an organization. Change and configuration management are important\nconsiderations for all organizations, and many resources exist to support that process; however, the topic\nof change and configuration management is not within the scope of this document. These process\nguidelines should be used to inform or enhance mature processes or help to establish a new process within\nan organization. The process shown in Figure 9 should also be construed to include feedback between\nphases. For example, if during the candidate selection phase, it is determined that key performance\nindicators were omitted, then it would be necessary to refine the objectives to accommodate necessary\nchanges.\n\n\nFigure 9. Lifecycle Components of Wireless Systems Deployment\n\nWhen embarking on a wireless enhancement, and the organization deploying such a network is\ninexperienced with wireless deployments, it may be prudent to begin with a small deployment or proof-ofconcept. This will allow the organization to learn about wireless while developing a process for wireless\ndeployments. If an immediate massive deployment is necessary for an inexperienced organization, a system\nintegrator who is experienced with large-scale wireless deployments will become vital to the success of the\nsystem. An experienced system integrator should be expected to cooperate with factory engineers who\nwish to implement the guidance provided within this document. A system integrator cannot replace the due\ndiligence of the factory engineers to oversee the project and select appropriate technologies for their\noperation.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe first step in the process is the Identification of Need. Each entity will have a vision for why a factory\nenhancement is necessary. It is here that the objectives and success criteria will be defined and that a\nwireless system may be considered. The next step is the site survey in which the factory environment is\nanalyzed comprehensively to determine the requirements for candidate solutions. Once the survey has\ntaken place and data is readily available from the survey, candidate systems will be selected. Following\ncandidate selection, a solution will be developed and tested. Performance will be validated against the\noriginal requirements, and a deployment plan will be devised. The end result is a deployed solution or\niteration that meets the technical requirements and effectively addresses the original business goals. It is\nimportant to understand the steps of conducting the site survey, identifying candidates, designing a solution,\nand deployment may be an iterative process. Iterative design is a proven and effective means to manage\nrisk.\n\n###### 4.1 Define Objectives\nBefore embarking on a wireless systems program within a factory, the business requirements, i.e., the\npurpose of the factory enhancement, should be fully understood, documented, and shared among the\nstakeholders within the organization. Defining objectives clearly and concisely enables support from within\nthe organization and a successful deployment.\n\nDefining the objectives will include identifying the reason for beginning a factory enhancement. The\norganization should first ask the question: What is the benefit of the factory improvement to the\norganization? Section 3 provides a list of success criteria that may be used to drive the implementation of\na wireless system or any factory enhancement program. These criteria include reliability improvements,\nimprovements in safety for humans and machinery, a reduction in operating cost, product quality\nimprovements, environmental stewardship, and regulatory compliance. Objectives must be communicated\nto management and stakeholders. Realistic technological expectations are defined for the wireless\ndeployment and communicated to stakeholders. Performance will be ascertained based on measurement\ndata not supposition.\n\nWireless technology will not serve all applications. For example, a safety integrated system demands\nreliable communications between the safety controller and its sensors and actuators. Wireless is low risk\nfor applications such as to enable Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) deployments, factory monitoring,\nsupervisory control, and backup systems to wired. Wireless for safety should address quality of service\nrequirements for the use case. Wireless systems do not directly address the reliability and latency\nrequirements of feedback control applications with real-time constraints, but depending on the physical\nsystem requirements, it is possible. Even with developments in wireless technology, a technical solution is\nnot always possible with respect to addressing security threats such as jamming and other forms of\ninterference. In such a case, optical wavelength communication may be better suited for such applications.\nTherefore, when using wireless for feedback control and safety, a careful risk analysis is required. When\nusing wireless for safety monitoring, the ISA 84 WG8 technical report may be used as a deployment guide\n\n[13]. A general reference for wireless applicability is given in Table 5. Since technologies can differ and\nimprove over time, this table should be used as a rule-of-thumb.\n\nSuccess of the wireless deployment depends on the purpose of the system and measurable objectives.\nWireless may be one component of the overall factory enhancement. Referring to Table 4, the purpose of\nthe wireless deployment may be to improve reliability, reduce costs, or comply with a new regulation. It is\nimportant that those goals be measurable. Measurement methods and metrics should be selected and agreed\nupon by the stakeholders. Objectives should be documented and managed using the organization’s\nestablished procedures.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs an example, a cost reduction program may be approached with an IIoT data collection system. After\nsufficient data is collected, an optimization algorithm could be used to identify points of process\nimprovement such as process tuning, robot insertion, and work scheduling. Achievable cost saving targets\nwould then be agreed upon and the upgrade would commence. In this simple scenario, expected data\nreliability and latency targets of the optimization algorithm should be ascertained prior to moving to the\nselection of candidates, as those targets would impact selection criteria and performance assessment. If\nexact figures are not available, simulation could be used to ascertain down-stream performance. An\neducated evaluation using as much data available during the objectives definition phase will help to set\nreasonable, measurable objectives while reducing associate risk of failure.\n\nTable 5. General Appropriateness for Industrial Wireless Applications\n\n|Application|General Recommendation|\n|---|---|\n|Factory and Building Monitoring, IIoT|Yes|\n|Condition Alarming|Yes|\n|Supervisory Control|Yes|\n|Feedback Control Backup to Wired|Yes|\n|Feedback Control Primary|Possible|\n|Safety Monitoring and Alarming|Possible|\n|Personnel Safety|Possible|\n|Safety Integrated Systems (SIS)|Possible1|\n\n\nA checklist for Defining Objectives is included in Appendix A-1. These tasks are important to achieving\nthe objectives of the wireless deployment. Clearly enumerated objectives for the factory enhancement are\nnecessary to explain how the wireless network will serve to achieve those objectives.\n\nOnce objectives are defined and the role that wireless will take to support those objectives is defined,\nmeasurement methodologies will need to be determined. At this point, it is not necessary to exactly define\nhow measurements will take place; however, it is possible to acknowledge that a measurement-based\nperformance assessment is needed and to begin thinking about how to accomplish the measuring.\n\nThe enterprise may have plans for future growth beyond the current enhancement. More wireless networks\nmay be needed to achieve future growth requirements of the enterprise. An iterative plan for growth is\ncommonly used to manage technical risk in some organizations, and future factory network enhancements\nmay be envisioned. For example, channels in the 5 GHz ISM band are particularly valuable as they support\nchannel bonding for high throughput applications; therefore, these channels require careful management.\nIt will be helpful to document those plans and establish a vision for the factory network that includes\nwireless technology such that stages such as candidate selection account for that vision.\n\nA security risk assessment is also necessary at the early stages of the program. A plan to implement security\nwill be an ongoing task for the factory if it hasn’t already been established. Many resources exist that will\nexplain how to implement a security program. These resources are discussed in Section 6. A security\n\n1 In general, wireless is not recommended as the primary mode of communication for an SIS, but it could be used as\na backup to wired communication. It is recognized that some SIS designs could require wireless as the only practical\nmode of communication in rare cases.\n\n\n-----\n\nmanagement plan will be an important part of implementing a security program within the factory enterprise\nand establishing a secure wireless network.\n\nWireless networks require bandwidth of the electromagnetic spectrum. Wireless may or may not already\nbe in use within the factory enterprise; therefore, it will be necessary to conduct a preliminary spectral\noccupancy survey of all wireless networks within the factory as well as all sources of interference to include\nmicrowave ovens, employee-owned devices, and outside interference. It will be important to establish the\nimportance of a spectrum management plan if one is not already established. A spectrum management plan\nwill contain an inventory of all known wireless networks and sources of electromagnetic emissions. It will\nalso establish policies and procedures for monitoring the electromagnetic spectrum and taking actions when\nevents occur. Like the security management plan, the spectrum management plan will be an ongoing\nactivity that is essential to running a secure and stable wireless network.\n\n###### 4.2 Factory Survey\nA factory survey is a critical part of a successful wireless deployment. With a detailed understanding of\nthe physical environment, RF propagation characteristics, and a full systems inventory will provide valuable\ndata to make the wireless deployment successful. A factory survey includes an assessment of the available\nRF spectrum, and identification of sources of interference, human safety requirements, and an inventory of\nfactory models, components, interfaces, and requirements. An early RF characterization of the factory\nenvironment may be helpful at this stage, but deferring the RF characterization study to the design stage\nafter a candidate solution is selected may be more practical and yield more useful information.\n\nA factory survey checklist is provided in Appendix A-2. The list provides useful considerations in\nconducting a comprehensive survey of the factory environment. Tailoring of the checklist is encouraged\nand will depend on enterprise objectives and processes. Considerations covered in the checklist are\ndescribed in the following sections.\n\n4.2.1 Applicable Physical Inventory\nTake a comprehensive inventory of the factory components that are envisioned to come into direct or\nindirect contact with the wireless network. Factory components could include the following:\n\n**physical factory layout – drawings and 2D/3D computer-aid design (CAD) models that depict the physical**\nenvironment;\n\n**measurement and control points – all process variables within the factory/plant process that may be of**\ninterest to be monitored or controlled;\n\n**machines – all machinery to be included in a prognostic, health monitoring, and control program;**\n\n\n**mobile robotic platforms – any machine that can be considered autonomous and controlled remotely;**\n\n**materials – a list of all parts, products, and raw materials that must be tracked throughout the process;**\n\n**maintenance tools – a list of all maintenance tools such as power tools that must be tracked;**\n\n\n**supervisory and feedback control points – a list of all real-time processors used to supervise and control**\nthe operation;\n\n**data collection systems – a list of all systems such as databases including interface specifications for each;**\n\n**data transfer points – a list of all systems that require a broadband data connection for general data or file**\ntransfer;\n\n\n-----\n\n**human-machine interfaces – a list of all human machine interface stations and mobile platform,**\nconnectivity requirements, and interface specifications;\n\n**employee-owned mobile devices – all device types such as tablets and cell-phones that employees will be**\nallowed to have in accordance with factory policies; and\n\n**Power sources – a list of all cables and power sources that could be used to supply power to devices.**\n\n\nTable 6.

Some factory\nenvironments must meet Intrinsic Safety considerations to prevent fires or explosions. List all safety\nrequirements that will affect the selection criteria of wireless devices.\n\n\n###### 4.3 Candidate Selection \nIn the previous two sections, the\nwireless system requirements were\ndefined and the site of intended\noperation was surveyed. Using the\nobtained information, the candidate\nselection process is initiated where\nvarious candidates are identified and\ntheir capabilities to satisfy various\nrequirements are evaluated. At this step\nof the selection process, two stages\nshould be envisioned: 1) Technical\nConsiderations and 2) Candidates\nevaluation. The first stage includes\nmapping factory requirements to\nnetwork candidate capabilities. The\nsecond stage includes obtaining\ninformation about various candidates,\nevaluation and validation of the options\nwith information against network\nrequirements, ranking the suitability of\ncandidates, and finally choosing a\ncandidate.\n\n\nValidate Requirements\n\n\n4.3.1 Technical Requirements\nThe list of factory constraints, network considerations, hard requirements, soft requirements, and applicable\nregulatory specifications will lead to the evaluation of needed functionality and selection of candidate\ndevices. As candidate capabilities often drive requirements, identification of technical requirements can be\ndone in parallel with candidate identification; however, special caution should be taken to avoid candidates\nthat excessively influence the requirements gathering process. Shown in Appendix A-3 is a candidate\nselection checklist. Initially, technical requirements should be enumerated and a prioritization or weighting\nfactor will need to be determined as not all requirements are equal in importance. Categories of technical\nrequirements are discussed in the following sections. They include the factory constraints, network\nrequirements, safety, security, regulatory compliance and internal approvals, and training.\n\n_4.3.1.1_ Factory Requirements and Constraints\nFactory requirements were discussed in Section 4.1 where enterprise objectives of deploying wireless\nnetworking are defined clearly. The applications where wireless networking benefits are defined include\nreliability, safety, efficiency, quality, environment and regulatory concerns. Moreover, the criteria for\n\n\n-----\n\nmeasuring wireless networking performance and its ability to achieve the factory requirements should be\nclearly defined. Where wireless is used for deterministic applications or other latency and reliability\nsensitive applications, precise requirements for those applications to include reliability, latency, and scale\nshould be developed. Moreover, factory security considerations will influence the type of wireless\nnetworks that will be considered and should be included in the list of technical considerations.\n\n4.3.1.2 Network Considerations\nThe following concepts are presented as a guide in enumerating the technical requirements.\n\n\n**Functionality and Applications – Based on various required applications, the need of multiple wireless**\nnetworks is considered due to basic differences in the requirements. As an example, the latency and\nreliability needs for control loops in discrete manufacturing may require a dedicated wireless network for\nthis type of applications where slow process monitoring has less reliability requirements and hence a\ndifferent type of wireless networks to be used.\n\n**RF Band – While comparing various candidate solutions, the operating RF band will be selected according**\nto performance, factory survey results, spectrum availability, regulatory concerns, and internal governance.\nIt is unreasonable to expect that an RF band will ever be “pristine” without any sources of interference, and\nthe selection of candidates should account for this fact. Requirements may need to account for noise and\ninterference immunity and other practical considerations.\n\n**Multi-speed Support – Like the previous point, different applications may work on the same wireless**\nnetwork but with different speeds or response times. As an example, a wireless network may work for all\nmonitoring applications because of the same requirement on the network. The monitored processes may\nhave different rates of change that require different rates of monitoring data transmissions. In this case, the\nmulti-speed support in the candidate wireless network is needed.\n\n**Scalability – One of the factory requirements that may validate the need for deploying a wireless network**\nis the future growth of the factory or factory network and the need for more communications devices\nthroughout. This requirement is mapped into the scalability of the candidate networks. For each candidate,\nthe scalability aspects must be discussed including the capacity of the network, ease of network expansion,\nand the ability to satisfy future growth.\n\n**Power Management – The power management requirements are obtained using factory knowledge**\nresulting from the factory site survey. A simple and important example is identification of power sources,\ntypes, and locations across the factory. Battery-operated devices use low power for transmission and should\nhave a predictable maintenance schedule for battery replacement. For continuously powered nodes, cabling\nrequirements and structure should be studied and the existing power sources must be defined. Moreover,\nthe power-efficiency of the wireless network should be considered depending on data delivery cost. To\nquantify power-efficiency, a power analysis of each candidate should be performed to include the number\nof components, required performance levels, power management schemes, and battery life.\n\n**Reliability – Another topic to be considered based on the factory requirements of various applications is**\nthe required reliability of the wireless network. That includes the plan of the network to transfer data in\nsituations when the wireless channels are poor. Also, the acceptable off-time of the wireless network has to\nbe defined. Reliability can be measured by the response of the wireless network to various effects. These\neffects include the RF spectrum usage, the RF agility, the interference immunity, and system power\nvariations such as output power and receiver sensitivity. Moreover, reliability includes various requirements\non data delivery including acceptable latency and errors.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Simplicity – Simplicity can be considered in two perspectives. First, the simplicity of the wireless network**\nsetup includes the ease of the design, development, and implementation of the wireless network. In this\nperspective, the candidate wireless networks are considered from the viewpoint of components, tools, and\ntechnologies. Programmable components are preferred to allow for more flexibility in designing,\nimplementing, and tuning the wireless network. Second, the simplicity of the wireless network used\nincludes the ease of device activation, network support, monitoring, and tuning of the wireless network.\n\n**Range** – The expected maximum distance between nodes in the wireless networks should be defined.\nRange is based on the link budget between any two nodes on a wireless network. Extending the effective\nrange of a network can be accomplished by adjusting power, using a directional antenna, or adding\nadditional nodes to a network to compensate and then deploying routing capabilities which may increase\ncomplexity, cost, and power consumption.\n\n**Maintainability – During the lifetime of a wireless network, nodes will need both emergency and regular**\nmaintenance. The ease of performing these tasks determines the level of maintainability of a candidate\nwireless solution. It includes both hardware and software maintenance to include part replacement, software\nupgrades, and reconfigurations. In the case of software maintainability, the user interface and the network\nmanagement software should be user-friendly.\n\n**Interoperability – Due to different applications and functionality, various communications protocols can**\noperate simultaneously; however, those protocols may be incompatible. For factory networks to\ninteroperate, their communications protocols must be compatible and easy to use or adapt. In a wireless\nsensor network, sensors may report their process information which is transmitted to a gateway. That\ninformation is not usable until it can be retrieved by another application such as a PLC program or\noptimization application. For that to happen, the gateway needs to communicate the information in\nlanguage (i.e., a protocol) that can be understood. For an example, automation applications have\ntraditionally used Modbus for localized communications between nodes such as a sensing unit and PLC.\nThis allows users to extract the data. Modbus, while easy to implement and quite ubiquitous, lacks language\nand context that other modern protocols provide.\n\n_4.3.1.3_ _Safety and Security_\nAlthough safety and security are part of the factory and network considerations, they have been discussed\nin a separate subsection due to their importance in protecting data, personnel, and factory assets. Safety and\nsecurity are discussed in more details in Sections 5 and 6, respectively.\n\nGenerally, the levels of required security against malicious attacks for different applications are diverse.\nHence, for each candidate wireless network, the level of achieved security and types of security systems\nmust be considered. Also, if using multiple wireless networks, the approach of security in these networks\nmust be considered and whether to use multiple systems that will be managed separately. Security can be\ndivided into three basic categories which are integrity, confidentiality, and availability.\n\nThe use of wireless networks in safety applications is primarily motivated by cost, mobility, and ruggedness\nconsiderations that wired solutions cannot accommodate. Wireless connections cannot be physically\ndamaged although it can be argued that interference is a form of physical interruption. On the other hand,\nsafety applications requirements can be very strict regarding latency, reliability, and robustness. As a result,\nwhile considering candidate systems for safety applications, requirements for these systems should be\nstrictly enforced. The deployed network must always comply with regulatory concerns.\n\n_4.3.1.4_ _Approval Requirements_\nDetermine if the candidates need specific regulatory or external approvals for operation. This includes\napprovals from entities such as the FCC or other internal governance structure such as a spectrum\n\n\n-----\n\nmanagement group. Also, safety approvals should be considered, such as intrinsic safety ratings, for every\nwireless node. Hence, a set of acceptable nodes can only be used at certain locations. All internal and\nexternal regulatory approvals should be enumerated.\n\n_4.3.1.5_ _Training Requirements_\nEach candidate will have unique training needs. These training requirements should be identified based on\nthe experience of personnel using the technology. Moreover, the training details should be determined such\nas how training will be conducted and how knowledge will be disseminated throughout the organization.\nThese training requirements should be defined to handle all installation, operation, and maintenance\nactivities.\n\n4.3.2 Candidate Evaluation and Comparison\nOnce the requirements and available options are identified, the evaluation and comparison of the possible\ncandidates will help to select the appropriate solution. By enumerating the technical requirements\ncomprehensively, each candidate can be assessed impartially according to the requirements and assigned\nweights. If it is helpful to do so, a scoring system that summates the weights of compliant requirements\ncan be adopted by the assessment team in selecting candidate solutions. In addition, where requirements\nare validated through testing, additional weight for those requirements can be applied. This approach gives\nadvantage to solutions that have been independently tested.\n\n_4.3.2.1_ _Identify the Candidates_\nAfter establishing all the network requirements, the following step is to identify the potential candidates.\nAs mentioned previously, candidate identification can occur in parallel to the requirements gathering\nprocess. The candidates are found through normal channels of internet searches, vendor consultation,\ndiscussions with systems integrators, and datasheets. Industrial communications experts and consultants\nare good sources for identifying candidates as their experience and knowledge of application scenarios and\ndeployment tuning can be helpful. Forums, conferences, and industry shows are good ways of identifying\ncandidates and capabilities.\n\n_4.3.2.2_ _Candidate Requirements Matrix_\nA candidate requirements matrix (CRM) such as the example given in Appendix A-4 is generated. The\nCRM contains a list of requirements, weights and priorities, and a list of the identified candidates. By\nenumerating the quantitative and qualitative requirements, it is then possible to capture requirements\ncompliance. List all the requirements atomically. A measurable specification for each atomic requirement\nshould be recorded in the table. A weighting factor is assigned for each requirement with a value between\n0 and 1. A value of 1 indicates the most important or highest priority; whereas, a value less than 1 assigns\na lower level of importance. A requirement should not have a value of 0, as that indicates that it is not a\nrequirement.\n\n_4.3.2.3_ _Validate Requirements and Capabilities_\nAt this point, all candidates are assessed for each requirement independently. Some requirements can be\nsatisfied through analysis of datasheets or performance reports from similar systems. Other requirements\nwill require verification by testing within the operating environment of the factory. Validation of a\nrequirement by analysis or by testing will be determined by the selection team. It is important in this\nvalidation process to test various system capabilities included in Section 4.3.1.2 such as the integration with\nexisting industrial hardware and running applications, and the performance of the system with the existing\nlevel of traffic over the RF spectrum and while the plant is in operation. It is also important to allow the\nwireless system to run for a period of time based on the applications to make sure it works seamlessly.\nTools such as simulation and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testbeds are valuable resources to leverage for\n\n\n-----\n\nassessing highly important or high-risk requirements. The results of each validation should be captured in\nthe CRM according to some pre-defined rubric such as the weight scoring system discussed previously.\n\n_4.3.2.4_ _Rank, Compare, and Choose_\nAt this point, a completed CRM has been generated. Those candidates that do not meet the absolute\nrequirements are eliminated. Those candidates that remain will then be compared quantitatively by\nrecording the scores for each candidate. The candidate with the highest score will be selected. This process\nis illustrated with the candidate scoring matrix in Appendix A-4.\n\n###### 4.4 Solution Design\n\nFrequency Planning At this stage of building the industrial wireless solution, the best\n\nand Approvals candidate has been selected and it is the time to specify the\n\nnetwork architecture, wireless system parameters, and wireless\n\nHarmonization\n\nnode locations, and validate the capabilities of the solution design.\nThe steps of obtaining the systems design can be listed as\n\nRegulatory\n\nApprovals planning, analysis, design, simulation, and optimization.\n\n\nQuality of Service The planning phase includes the frequency planning and the\n\nAnalysis corresponding regulatory and internal approvals. Frequency\n\nplanning includes channel selection and management. An RF\n\nTopology Selection\n\nQuality of Service (QoS) analysis can be done by evaluating\nreceive signal power and propagation characteristics given\n\nSimulation hypothetical transmitter and receiver locations. Results of a QoS\n\nstudy are helpful in selecting locations for network infrastructure\nand conducting simulations when necessary. The network design phase includes the wireless network\narchitecture, topology selection, and node placement. Many network design aspects can be defined before\nmeasurement and analysis but may need to be updated after an analysis of the QoS measurements are\navailable.\n\nSimulation is a good tool for reducing risk associated with complex designs or scenarios involving wireless\nsupervisory or feedback control. Simulation can be useful in predicting performance of a wireless system\nbefore a major deployment investment is made. Based on simulation results, final tuning of the design\nparameters can be performed before deployment.\n\n4.4.1 Frequency Planning and Approvals\nDuring the candidate selection, the operating frequency band of the wireless solution is determined. First,\napprovals for the use of a certain frequency band need to be obtained as explained in the following\nsubsection. Then, frequency planning should be performed including the study of channel utilization and\ninterference effects, and identification of coverage cells and access points.\n\nDuring channel utilization, the initiated traffic from each physical point is evaluated based on the physical\nprocess requirements. The bandwidth requirement for each connection is determined based on traffic over\nthis connection. It is advisable, if testing can be performed, to verify these calculations. The coverage level\nand networking connectivity at a certain work space is determined based on total amount transferred data.\nDepending on the technology used, the number of channels required to cover the work space is determined\nfollowing the general concept of frequency reuse in various coverage regions.\n\nUsing the spectrum survey to identify interference levels, the received signal quality can be estimated to\nevaluate the requirements for achieving the calculated rate. Finally, the access points requirements are\ndefined to carry traffic between nodes in a coverage region and to carry traffic to other network locations.\nFurthermore, various applications are considered during this phase including instrumentation, voice, video,\n\n\n-----\n\nbackhaul, and safety applications.\nIn most of the cases, different\ntechnologies will be deployed for\ndifferent applications. However, the\nfrequency planning should be done\nover all the wireless systems.\n\n4.4.2 Regulatory Approvals\nSome radio bands require FCC\nlicensing approval before use.\nLicensed frequencies should be\nstrongly considered in applications\nwhere safety is an issue such as\nlifting with overhead cranes where Figure 10. Example of a QoS Heat Map\nexclusive use of frequencies\nminimizes the probability of interference and hence a safer operation is achieved. When FCC licensing is\nrequired, start the application process early to ensure timely approval, or to provide time to develop\nalternative solutions if the license application is declined. For frequencies that are not licensed by the FCC,\nit may be necessary for a manufacturing company to seek approval from an internal governance board to\nensure harmonious operations on those frequencies.\n\n4.4.3 Quality of Service Analysis\nConducting a site survey will provide information about how RF transmissions will propagate through the\nfactory given hypothetical transmission points. RF transmissions propagate through the air and will lose\npower with distance in accordance with a rate of loss. This rate of power loss is influenced by the amount\nand type of materials present in the environment and the RF band of interest. Radio waves behave\ndifferently at 900 MHz than they do at 2.4 GHz or 60 GHz.\n\nSome materials such as steel will reflect RF transmissions creating reflections and a reverberation effect,\nwhile other materials such as concrete absorb RF. Reverberation will spread the RF energy over time.\nWhile total power is less diminished in a reverberant environment, the time spreading can cause significant\ndistortions and result in data loss and delay. In some cases, reflections can be used to the advantage of the\nnetwork if distortion is not severe. Most indoor factories fall into the absorptive category. In an absorptive\nenvironment, RF transmissions are significantly diminished, but distortion due to time spreading is\nmeasurably less.\n\nBy identifying potential access points, a coverage map, also called a “heat map,” as shown in Figure 10\nmay be produced that gives an indication of expected quality of service (QoS). A coverage map will provide\na graphical perspective about how RF energy permeates the factory environment if locations of wireless\ninfrastructure are known. An RF coverage map can be costly but helpful when attempting to predict through\nsimulation or link budgeting the quality of service for a candidate wireless technology. Each wireless\ntechnology has different capabilities. Differences in type and grade of the device matters. A high-end and\nmore expensive wireless device may have a distance that is an order of magnitude better than a less capable\ndevice; however, the performance difference may be reflected in the price. Therefore, a heat map provides\nsome perspective of performance, but it should not be used as the single indicator. Overly uniform heat\nmaps may be an indication of faulty measurements or that the simulation was too simplistic. Moreover, the\nphysical factory environment can be very dynamic and the RF characteristic will reflect those changes.\nPrior to conducting an RF site survey which implies selection of a candidate has been conducted, it is\nsuggested to validate performance of a network during candidate selection using the physical equipment\nrather than try to predict performance.\n\n\n-----\n\nAlternatively, NIST performed a high-fidelity propagation analysis of three indoor factory facilities.\nDuring this study, NIST measured power loss and delay spread of RF transmissions in three factories. The\nresults of the study were published in NIST Technical Note TN-1951[14]. By using technical information\nprovided in this study, it is possible to predict wireless network performance given transmit power, the\nsensitivity of the receiving devices, and the nature of the communication channel, i.e., whether the channel\nis considered line-of-sight (LOS) or non-line-of-sight (NLOS). Strong RF signals are not a definitive\nindicator of high quality of service within a harsh industrial environment where multi-path reflections\ndominate. Certainly, signal-to-noise ratio is an important factor, but reflections off factory walls and\nequipment and the category of the wireless channel (i.e., LOS and NLOS) can dominate performance of\nthe wireless network[15]. If a QoS Survey is impractical, this report can serve as a benchmark for how\nradio transmissions will behave in a factory environment.\n\n4.4.4 Frequency Harmonization\nHarmonization of the RF spectrum is an essential step in managing the performance and allocation of the\nspectral resources within the factory. Depending on the size and nature of the factory operation,\nmanagement of the spectral resources can be critical to the availability of the wireless networks. The\nfollowing are practical consideration in harmonization of the RF spectrum within a factory.\n\n**FCC Licensing – Obtaining a license from the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC)**\nto obtain the exclusive rights to a specific frequency in a well-defined geographic area.\n\n**Channelization – Assigning a specific channel within a frequency band to a specific device or wireless**\nnetwork, and allowing no other device to share that channel within the device’s operating distance. This is\napplied where dependability and speed are paramount such as safety situations.\n\n**Multiplexing – Allowing multiple users to share a frequency using techniques such as time division, code**\ndivision, phase shifting, and others. This is usually applied where there are many users and performance is\nless critical.\n\n**Proximity – Using low power devices at short distances between transmitter and receiver. This concept is**\napplied where close proximity is practical and the impact of interference is minimal.\n\n**Pairing – Coupling a specific transmitter and specific receiver using identity codes.**\n\n\n**Matching – Similar to pairing, but using groups of transmitters and groups of receivers so that any receiver**\nin the group can work with any transmitter in the group.\n\n**Data Filtering – Applicable to handling the problem of “data flooding” when a passive Radio Frequency**\nIdentification (RFID) transceiver picks up tag data from different RFID usage domains. The filtering is\nsometimes included as a part of the RFID application software.\n\n4.4.5 Topology and Node Placement\nSome wireless networks allow for the selection of a topology. For example, ISA100.11a allows for the\nselection of mesh network and star topologies. Mesh and star both have strengths and weaknesses, for\nexample in reliability and latency. To select the best topology for a wireless network, various aspects are\nconsidered such as the scalability, mobility, security, infrastructure, and the intended use of the wireless\nnodes. A brittle topology can create squeeze points in the network, placing a burden on one or more nodes,\ntaxing battery life, and creating points of failure. The use of a certain topology can limit the number of\nnodes and the coverage of a wireless network. Hence, the expected growth of the wireless network\ndetermines the required number of access points and their coverage. Moreover, node mobility determines\nthe need for roaming within the plant and the required speed for this roaming. Changes in the physical\n\n\n-----\n\nfactory environment can occur, and where these changes can be anticipated, it is recommended to add\nrouting or hand-off points such that service is not interrupted.\n\nThe processing needed for various security aspects determines the need of high processing nodes within\neach coverage area or that simple wireless nodes are enough to achieve the required security needs.\nMoreover, the existing infrastructure availability may make it easier to use a star topology, for example.\nFinally, amount of traffic generated or handled by a wireless node can also help in selecting a topology. As\nan example, field nodes with low data rates are commonly connected in a star topology to aggregate data\nbefore forwarding to the more congested parts of the network. Another example is back-haul nodes where\npoint-to-point high data rate links are commonly used.\n\n\nIt is recommended that engineers consult vendor\ndocumentation. Vendors and service providers will often\nprovide systems engineering guides that will help the designer\nto optimize the reliability of their network by providing bestpractice guidance on node placement, the number of\ngateways, and device configuration (e.g., routing or nonrouting).\n\n\nUse vendor systems\nengineering guides\nwhen available.\n\n\n4.4.6 Simulation\nSimulation is a good tool for reducing risk associated with complex designs or scenarios involving wireless\nsupervisory or feedback control. Simulation allows for performance of the wireless system to be assessed\nbefore a major deployment investment is made. The accuracy of the simulation will rely on the fidelity of\nthe model used. A high-fidelity model will produce more accurate results that match the real world;\nhowever, such accurate simulations require detailed knowledge of the radio environment and network\nbehavior. Testing with actual equipment can be a more effective means of assessing performance; but\nsimulation can be used to identify risk of the fully deployed system and is better suited for optimization\nthan is trial-and-error network design. During network simulations, various networking performance\nmetrics should be considered. These network aspects have been discussed in Section 4.3.1.2 where the\nsystem parameters are optimized to achieve the required performance levels. Furthermore, the node\nplacement and network structure including the need of relays and their placement are investigated during\nthese simulations.\n\nFor wireless systems involving feedback control or critical\nsupervisory control, simulations are recommended to verify Simulation should\nthat a network design will meet the high-reliability never replace testing\nrequirements necessary for critical systems functions. with real hardware.\nWireless networks are installed to achieve certain objectives\nin the industrial environment. To tune the design parameters\nand validate the ability of the wireless network to achieve\nthese objectives, cyber-physical systems simulations should be used to predict performance. Simulations\nshould include failure modes such as power loss to devices and infrastructure, RF interference, and changes\nin the physical environment that will lead to increased attenuation, signal loss, or exacerbated multi-path.\nSimulations that combine both a network and the physical model are often referred to as a co-simulation.\nMany tools exist for conducting simulations; however, co-simulations require effort to combine the physical\nsimulator with the network simulator. When conducting a co-simulation, a model for the physical process\nis needed which can be generally simplified to virtually represent the process rate, inputs, and outputs.\nMoreover, the system dynamics and control algorithms are included to model the wireless network effects\non the control loops. Furthermore, the interfaces between the physical system and the wireless network\nshould be modeled including the difference in timing behaviors of both systems.\n\n\n-----\n\nSimulation is a useful tool for verifying a network design or developing an optimal solution, but it should\nbe used with caution and is better validated through testing. When wireless is used for control of an\nindustrial system, testing should be an integral part of the design process.\n\n###### 4.5 Deployment and Monitoring Antenna Positioning\n\nand Orientation\n\nOnce the system is designed, it must be deployed.\nDeployment involves installation, operation, and Antenna\n\nCharacteristics\n\nmaintenance of the designed wireless network.\nDeployment can be divided into three major aspects which Configuration\nare the Deployment, Monitoring, and Updating. Verification\nDeployment includes setup, testing, and training of the\n\nLine-of-Sight (LOS)\n\ndesigned network. Setup entails installation of the\nnetworking equipment, configuration, and personnel\n\nBlack-box Testing\n\ntraining. Once installation is concluded, Monitoring and\nAnalysis will commence. During this stage, the operational\nnetwork will be monitored and will include spectrum Personnel Training\nsensing, capture of network statistics and traffic as\nnecessary, cybersecurity event detection, and physical BYOD Policy\nenvironment monitoring. Using data from monitoring and\nanalysis, it is possible to make improvements to the network over time, extend the network, and tune the\nsystem such that performance is improved. Updating and Optimization is a process of continuous\nimprovement. Continuous improvement will come from understanding the network and any considerations\nsuch as antenna position, frequency allocations, interference, and loading that may degrade network\nperformance over time. Wireless networks operate very similar to wired networks with the main difference\nbeing the nature of the wireless medium through which communication is conducted.\n\n4.5.1 Deployment\nDuring Deployment, the wireless network hardware and software are installed and tested to achieve the\ndesigned performance levels. Proper antenna installation assures the delivery of wireless transmissions over\nthe network. While technological capabilities of existing products may lead to specific technical\nrequirements of the deployment, this section focuses on the general wireless networking aspects of\ndeployment. Moreover, training on operating and managing the wireless network is essential at this stage\nto prevent any loss in performance due to human errors. The expected result of this phase is a fully\noperational wireless network which implements the intended design.\n\n_4.5.1.1_ _Antenna Positioning and Orientation_\nOne major consideration in a wireless deployment is the placement of the antennas for each device. Antenna\nplacement includes antenna positioning and orientation. In general, it is best to position the antennas of\neach device with clear visibility to the other devices to which it will connect. This can be achieved by\nplacing antennas at high positions above machinery and other obstructions. One drawback to a higher\nantenna position is that it may increase the cable distance between the antenna and the wireless device.\nIncreased cable distance will lead to increased transmit power loss and reduced receiver sensitivity.\nInstallation according to manufacturer instructions and specifications will usually lead to optimal\n\n\n-----\n\nperformance; however, it is important\n\nDeployment\n\nfor the installer to be aware of the\nlimitations on antenna cable - etup Infrastructure\n\n                                        - eployment Testing\n\nextensions. Conversely, placing - ersonnel Training\nantennas close to the ground will\nintroduce more power loss with\ndistance and should be avoided. It is\n\nMonitoring and Analysis\n\ngenerally more advisable to incur\ncable losses to achieve appropriate - pectrum Monitoring\n\n                                       - etwork Monitoring\n\nantenna height than to position an - ecurity Status Monitoring\nantenna close to the ground. - nvironment Monitoring\n\nAnother aspect is antenna alignment\nwhich includes both the antenna Updating and Optimizing\npolarization and radiation pattern. - etwork Extension\nThe antenna radiation pattern is a key - oftware and Firmware Updates\nconsideration in optimal antenna - ower Adjustments and System Tuning\nplacement. A traditional dipole\n“omni-directional” antenna is never\n\nFigure 11. Steps to a Successful Wireless Deployment\n\ntruly omni-directional. In fact, these\ntypes of antennas radiate outward\nwith a toroidal pattern with a polarity that is parallel to the orientation of the antenna. Positioning such\nantennas high up on a ceiling will degrade performance of the wireless network. Common flat “pancakestyle” Wi-Fi antennas are examples of sideways radiators. Although they appear to radiate downward, they\nradiate outward from the edges. Positioning such antennas high up will result in poor network performance\nunless the antenna pattern is designed to radiate downward and outward. Knowing the radiation pattern of\nany antenna is an important aspect in positioning an antenna.\n\n_4.5.1.2_ _Antenna Characteristics_\nAs mentioned in the previous section, a crucial aspect during the deployment phase of the wireless network\nis the selection of antenna characteristics to match antenna placement and performance requirements.\nConsiderations include antenna type, radiation pattern, and the number of antennas also called antenna\ndiversity. The first major selection step is between omni-directional antennas and directional antennas.\nOmni-directional antennas are selected when the node can be connected to various nodes in various\ndirections through the network operation. Conversely, directional antennas achieve better performance if\nthe direction of the transmissions is fixed. Directional antennas can be electronically or mechanically\nsteered. Electronic steering is not usually required for stationary deployments but is very useful for mobile\napplications. Omni-directional antennas are most useful for mesh style networks; whereas, directional\nantennas are more useful for microwave links and other long-haul connections. Directional antennas are\nalso useful for device deployment on the perimeter of a factory. Assuming a well-designed model, the\nantenna will then be considered the most important contributor to establishing an effective link margin.\nTherefore, selecting an antenna with the appropriate characteristics for the position of the deployment is\nparamount for an effective operation.\n\n\n-----\n\n_4.5.1.3_ _Configuration Verification_\nOften the wireless network is deployed by a Gateway/\nteam different than those who designed the AP\nsystem. Therefore, a process for verifying\nthat the network was deployed according to\ndesign intent is required. This would include\nvisual inspection of installed devices and\ncables, as well as inspection of configuration\nand provisioning of the network equipment.\n\nA B C\n\n_4.5.1.4_ _Establish Line-of-Sight (LOS) Links_\nThe existence of an unobstructed LOS\nbetween wireless nodes improves the\nperformance significantly. This is primarily\na result of the LOS component of the\ntransmission as seen by the receiver\noverpowering the other reflected components X\nfrom objects in the factory. When a LOS\ncomponent is missing, path loss between\n\nFigure 12. LOS links in a mesh network\n\ntransmitter and receiver will increase\nsignificantly. The resulting multi-path reflection will distort the signal resulting in link reliability problems.\nAs a result, it is highly recommended to establish a LOS communication link between each transmitter and\nreceiver. For mesh networks, this is not usually possible or necessary; however, within a mesh network at\nleast one LOS link should exist for each transmitter and at least one LOS route should exist between each\ntransmitter and the centralized gateway devices if gateways exist. This is shown in Figure 12 where device\nX communicates with a complete LOS route to the gateway through its LOS counterpart, device C. It may\nbe possible to communicate through nodes A and B effectively. One caveat to this general rule is that\ndevice C should have the resources (i.e., bandwidth, power, and processing speed) to accommodate the\nadded load of the traffic from device X. It is important to follow the manufacturer’s recommendations\nwhen establishing LOS connectivity and an effective network topology.\n\n_4.5.1.5_ _Black-box Test Methods_\nFactory operators, system integrators, and control systems designers are rarely experts in wireless\ncommunications systems. Considerations such as electromagnetic propagation, antenna efficiency, path\nloss exponents, packet error rates, and medium access are often foreign concepts to factory engineers. When\navailable, link quality metrics such as packet loss ratios are informative but can be difficult to understand\nwith complex mesh architectures and routing algorithms. The control system design will only need to know\nthe statistical distribution of latency and reliability of information through the network to design a controller\nthat is robust. Therefore, it is recommended that black-box tests be conducted for each installed device.\nBlack-box tests are those types of tests that do not require internal performance metrics from the wireless\ndevice. Instead, black-box tests allow for performance evaluation using live process signals to measure\nreliability and latency. It is possible to construct black-box test harnesses; however, having network devices\nand infrastructure such as the PLC that support black-box tests makes evaluation much easier for the factory\nengineer.\n\n_4.5.1.6_ _Personnel Training on Network Operation_\nThe operating personnel of the wireless network need to be trained on setup, administrating, and monitoring\nof the network. A certification process should be well defined to ensure the ability of personnel in\n\n\n-----\n\nperforming the required networking tasks. The use of network diagnostic tools is another major task to\ndeploy and maintain the network to be able to get the most out of the installed network.\n\n_4.5.1.7_ _Personnel Training on General Awareness of Wireless Networks_\nWireless technology pervades everyday personal life. Employees operate cell phones and other personal\nelectronic devices. These devices can interfere with the operation of the factory network as the employees\nmay not be aware of the impacts of using their personal devices within the factory. To lessen the impact of\npersonal devices on the factory network, it is recommended that employees are trained with a general\nknowledge of how wireless networks function and how personal devices can impact the performance of the\nfactory network. For example, employees may bring cell phones with Wi-Fi hotspots turned on which can\nbe disruptive. Another example could include proactive employees using personal walkie-talkies to be\nmore productive or safe and disrupt the operation of a factory network in the process. Finally, educating\nemployees about keeping microwave ovens clean can lessen EM leakage from the ovens and thereby lessen\nthe impact to the factory wireless network.\n\n_4.5.1.8_ _Bring Your Own Device Policy_\nAnother important aspect when designing a wireless solution is building or updating the bring your own\ndevice (BYOD) policy. This policy introduces the industrial environment regulations for using employees’\nown devices. The focus here is about wireless devices because of the interference and security issues that\nmay be caused as a result of using these devices in the work environment.\n\nGenerally, certain work areas at which safety wireless signals are transmitted must have exclusive bands\nusage for the safety applications that may lead, in some scenarios, to restrict the usage of personal devices\ntotally. A certain private wireless network may restrict device connection establishment to work nonpersonal devices. Moreover, certain types of wireless may be prohibited either due to their power level or\ncontinuous data transmission that may cause unacceptable interference.\n\n\n4.5.2 Monitoring and Analysis\nThe operational wireless network is continually\nmonitored to keep track of various parameters\nrelated to the network performance. Network\nmonitoring includes continual monitoring of the\nEM spectrum, the performance of the network,\nthe security state of the network and physical\nfactory process, and the physical environment\nthat impacts EM propagation.\n\n\n**_Environment_**\n\n|Monitoring and Analysis Spectrum Network Security Environment Monitoring Monitoring Monitoring Monitoring|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|Spectrum Monitoring|Environment Monitoring|\n\n\n_4.5.2.1_ _Spectrum Monitoring_\nSpectrum monitoring is performed in various stages while building a wireless network. It is performed\ninitially within the site survey and later through the design stage where spectrum monitoring is performed\nwhile testing the designed network. During network operation, continual spectrum monitoring is\nrecommended. A robust spectrum monitoring solution will include spectrum analytics, ability to correlate\nthe spectral activity to factory activities, trends and prediction of spectrum usage, spectrum anomaly\ndetection, geolocation of interference, and reporting. A spectrum monitoring solution will provide a\ncomplete situational awareness picture of the RF bands used by the factory operation and the interference\npatterns that could impact factory operation. In fact, it is possible that the spectrum monitoring solution be\nintegrated with factory automation features such as PLCs.\n\n\n-----\n\n_4.5.2.2_ _Network Monitoring_\nNetwork monitoring is important as it includes various nodes’ status, traffic patterns, routes, and statistics,\nlink health and errors, and network topology. A network monitoring solution is usually used to monitor and\nanalyze various network aspects. First, various nodes of the network are monitored to ensure that each one\nis active and correctly connected to intended nodes in the network. Backup nodes also may be checked to\nconfirm availability for operating if needed. Various nodes are checked periodically through test messages\nand data exchange between nodes. Network monitoring will support factory engineers in assessing the\nlocation of bottlenecks, sources of data surges, hop patterns, and other considerations.  It will also help\nengineers to assess if wireless devices need to be replaced, repaired, or adjusted, especially if a change in\nthe environment has degraded performance. Many network monitoring tools exist in both open source and\ncommercially. It is recommended that the product used is selected based on customization requirements\nand in-house knowledge of networking in general.\n\n_4.5.2.3_ _Security Monitoring_\nTo monitor the network security status, statistics about the packet errors, failures, timeouts, and successes\nare evaluated. Like spectrum monitoring and network monitoring, security monitoring is a consideration\nthat can be addressed through third-party products and solutions. Security monitoring will allow for the\ndetection of abnormal network events such as unauthorized access, rogue devices, and suspicious network\nbehavior that deviates from expected behavior. Security monitoring tools will provide deep-packet\ninspection and traffic pattern anomaly detection. The security monitoring feature may come as an option\nor feature of a network monitor or wireless product, or it might be a standalone feature such as wireless\nsniffers. The list of security products in both the open source and commercial domain is vast. A security\nmonitoring product should be easy to use, support the protocols used within the factory, and integrate well\nwithin existing factory networks and reporting tools. For wireless networks, security monitoring could be\nbuilt into the wireless devices or exist independent of the industrial operation. Wireless traffic sniffers exist\nand must be configured with the authentication materials of the operational network to be useful.\n\n_4.5.2.4_ _Environment Monitoring_\nThe surroundings of wireless nodes will have a large impact on their performance. Therefore, stacking or\nmoving of materials through the wireless links must be monitored. Metal as an example is highly reflective\nand can change wireless link behavior. Different materials may have different effects on the performance\nand hence monitoring is required to avoid scenarios where the planned wireless links change greatly\nbecause of the surrounding environment. Any intended change in the environment or configuration of the\nfactory should undergo normal factory change management procedures. Change management procedures\nshould include the possible performance impact to wireless networks.\n\n4.5.3 Updates and Optimization\nIn an operational system, various network settings may\n\nUpdates and\n\nneed to be adjusted over time. Software and firmware Optimization\nmay need to be updated, or the network may need to be\nextended. Continuous maintenance and optimization\n\n**_Software and_** **_Power_**\n\nincludes accommodating network extensions, **_Network_** **_Firmware_** **_adjustments and_**\n\n**_Extension_**\n\nperforming software and firmware updates, and making **_Updates_** **_System Tuning_**\nantenna and power adjustments to wireless devices.\n\n|Updates and Optimization Software and Power Network Firmware adjustments and Extension Updates System Tuning|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|Network Extension|Power adjustments and System Tuning|\n\n\n_4.5.3.1_ _Network Extension_\nOne of the major advantages of using wireless networks is the scalability of the network where new nodes\ncan be added to the network conveniently. Often in an industrial network, the infrastructural components\nto the network are installed first and the devices themselves are later deployed. This is a common\ndeployment style for industrial wireless mesh networks such as ISA100 Wireless and WirelessHART. By\n\n\n-----\n\ninstalling the infrastructure components first in such network types, the aggregator nodes can be placed to\nmaximum coverage over the facility. Devices can then be added to the network as needed by the\ninstrumentation, automation components, and data collection facilities.\n\nIn industrial mesh networks, the number of nodes allowed to connect to an access point is limited. When\nadding more nodes to a network, wireless resource allocation should be reviewed and revised accordingly\nto accommodate additional traffic. Testing of the network performance after extension is then required to\nverify the correct operation. However, adding a new node while the network is in operation must be done\nwithout a negative impact to the operational network. In a well-planned network, maximum throughput and\nnetwork size are designed to accommodate new devices. In a time-division multiple access (TDMA) mesh\nnetwork, gateway placement, topology, and scheduling are all designed with growth in mind. Therefore,\nwhen extending the network with new nodes, the device will only need to be physically installed with\nappropriate antenna placement, provisioned, and then powered on.\n\nWhenever possible, simulation is a tool that can be used to validate a new design that will be added to the\ndeployed system. Especially for feedback and supervisory control systems using wireless communication,\nsimulation could be an essential step in avoiding a potential problem. It is high recommended to use\nsimulation for wirelessly controlled system before any deployment.\n\nWhen extending the network, all aspects of the wireless lifecycle can be repeated at a smaller scale including\ntesting for performance, assessing the increased interference, and monitoring for traffic patterns and\nnetwork topology. Afterwards, network parameter tuning and optimization can be performed on the new\ndevices and the overall network to accommodate the new devices.\n\n_4.5.3.2_ _Software and Firmware Updates_\nVarious network devices need firmware updates to fix discovered bugs, patch security holes, make\nperformance enhancements, and add new features. Periodic checking for the availability of the updates is\nrecommended; however, automatic installation of updates is not recommended. Before applying any update\nto software or firmware, the update must be validated through testing first before rolling out to the deployed\nnetwork. Steps involved with rolling out updates to software and firmware include the following:\n\n  - Extensive testing of the update within a controlled environment\n\n  - Configuration management of the existing system with roll-back capability\n\n  - Deployment plan developed and approved according to internal governance policies\n\n  - Authorization of the update through internal governance policies\n\n\nAn operational factory system is very different from a typical non-operational office system. Application\nof software or firmware updates to the wireless network or any component with in the factory operation\ncould result in downtime. It is highly recommended that all updates are thoroughly researched and tested\nbefore deployment.\n\n_4.5.3.3_ _Power Adjustments and Reporting Rate Tuning_\nTuning the transmission power of wireless nodes allows for less interference and more control of nodes\nassociating with other network nodes. Increased transmit power is not necessarily an improvement.\nIncreasing transmit power can lead to better performance for one device on a network, but it can also lead\nto shorter battery life. Increased transmit power may also lower performance of other devices on adjacent\nwireless networks using the same RF band. A different approach to tuning transmit power is to develop a\nlink budget and maintaining a defined link margin to accommodate unexpected interference or a change in\nthe environment. Developing a link budget for each device is a common method for accomplishing this\ntask; however, many wireless systems will employ automatic power control which adjusts transmit power\n\n\n-----\n\nto reach quality of service thresholds but without disadvantaging other devices or shortening battery life.\nPower adjustments account for regulations that limit the radiated power from an antenna.\n\nReport rate tuning is the process for setting the transmission rate for a given device. The reporting rate will\ndetermine how often process variables that are monitored by a network device are transmitted. A high\nreporting will result in more transmissions and more bandwidth and battery utilization. If the rate is set to\nbe too high, other wireless device transmissions may fail, and, if the reporting rate is set to be too low, the\nassigned bandwidth will be wasted. Reporting rates should be set according to the process design\nrequirements. Later adjustments should be made in accordance with new process requirements or network\nreliability requirements which are usually derived from process requirements. Rate adaptation is usually\naccomplished through manual intervention; however, automatic reporting rates can be applied to adjust to\nconditions within the factory and the wireless network.\n\n###### 5 WIRELESS FOR SAFETY\n\n\nWireless systems may be useful to enhancing the safety profile within a factory operation. These systems\ncan be used to prevent injury through improved communication and enhanced situational awareness within\nthe factory. Wireless safety systems are used in many applications including those designed to prevent\nchemical handling mishaps, avoid heavy equipment accidents such as “struck-by, and back-over” incidents,\nprevent falls through active position monitoring and safety interconnects, provide situational awareness\nwithin confined spaces, and improve safety for non-employees.\n\nAlong with adaption of wireless sensor networks for industrial automation, there are more applications of\nwireless technology created by users after they are more familiar and comfortable with the wireless\ntechnology. Also because of the strong benefits of wireless applications that can save project execution\ntime and cost, more and more wireless has been used for secondary or backup systems for time-critical\napplication such as safety or control applications. Based on this movement, ISA-84 working group (WG)\n8 developed a technical report on wireless for safety systems other than those of a safety integrated system\n(SIS), i.e., those systems with a system integrity level (SIL) rating below ten. The technical report describes\nthe additional elements needed to be addressed when wireless technology is used in an Independent\nProtection Layer (IPL). Refer to the ISA technical report TR84.00.08-2017 Guidance for Application of\n_Wireless Sensor Technology to Non-SIS Independent Protection Layers for more information[13]._\n\n###### 6 INDUSTRIAL WIRELESS SECURITY\n\n\nIndustrial control systems (ICS) cybersecurity is a branch of general cybersecurity in which the systems\nbeing protected have physical characteristics which if compromised can lead to down-time, injury or death,\nand economic loss. Industrial control systems include supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)\nsystems, localized work-cells, enterprise control systems, and cloud-based factory collection systems.\nTraditional information technology (IT) systems differ from operational technology (OT) systems primarily\nin their cybersecurity priorities. In general, IT systems defend against data extractions. Encryption used to\nprovide confidentiality is of primary concern. In OT systems, confidentiality is no longer of paramount\nconcern. While eavesdropping can lead to reverse engineering of proprietary factory methods and design,\nit is usually more important to keep the factory running. Therefore, technologies must assure that both\ncybersecurity controls and cyber-attack do not limit or prevent the capability of the factory running with\nhigh availability. Table 7 lists the priorities of IT and OT systems. It is important for IT professionals to\nrecognize that wireless security practices used in the office may not be available for factory deployments.\nIf they are available, they may not be desirable to maintain system availability. Securing the industrial\nnetwork can be summarized in the following considerations: Secure the physical environment; Secure the\nend-points; Secure the controller; and Secure network transmissions/data. Industrial wireless networks\n\n\n-----\n\nhave the same consideration as wired networks with the addition of protecting the electromagnetic spectrum\nallocated for the industrial wireless network operation.\n\nTable 7. Typical Priorities of IT and OT Systems\n\n\n**Priority** **IT** **OT**\nHighest Confidentiality Availability\n… Integrity Authenticity\n… Authenticity Integrity\nLowest Availability Confidentiality\n\nThe number of devices connecting to industrial networks is increasing at a rapid rate. It exposes systems to\nsecurity breaches and cyberattacks. As a result, security is paramount for industrial operations. Some\nmanufacturers think wireless will create new vulnerabilities in the network that may result in potential\nthreats. Just making the wireless network accessible through a password is not adequate. One key concern\nis how to identity and eliminate rogue access points. Therefore, wireless intrusion detection systems and\nintrusion prevention systems are in demand.\n\nIn addition, isolation of production devices on a separate network from corporate networks, internet traffic,\nand phone and surveillance systems is necessary. In other words, one can employ an “island” approach to\nnetworking that limits the movement of traffic and devices between islands. By properly segmenting a\nnetwork, it can limit movement between networks to appropriate devices and block the movement of\ndevices that are unnecessary or provide little value.\n\n###### 6.1 Practical Considerations\nPlant operators should follow manufacturer guidance for security where it does not conflict with recognized\nguidance and best-practices.\n\n|Priority|IT|OT|\n|---|---|---|\n|Highest|Confidentiality|Availability|\n|…|Integrity|Authenticity|\n|…|Authenticity|Integrity|\n|Lowest|Availability|Confidentiality|\n\n\n**Ease of Implementation – Make securing wireless deployments easy to implement and maintain**\n\n**Physical security – Physically protect wireless access points, gateways, modems, and devices**\n\n\n**Default security – Auto-configure network devices to the highest security level by default**\n\n**Updates – Securely update software, firmware, and data over-the-air or wire and disable automatic updates**\n\n\n**Share and Report – Share security threat data, perform analytics, and continually learn about security**\n\n**Trust – Form a network of digital trust and protect data and privacy as practical and possible.**\n\n\n**Full life-cycle – Securely operate the network across the entire lifecycle from product development through**\ndeployment\n\n**Passwords – Do not use default passwords once the system is installed; protect passwords; authenticate**\nusers; enforce password change policies\n\n**Zones and Conduits – Separate industrial networks into zones and conduits and separate the industrial**\nnetwork from the enterprise office network; apply policies to industrial networks separate from the\nenterprise network (refer to IEC 62443[3])\n\n**Spectrum Monitoring – Use spectrum monitoring to gain awareness of normal versus abnormal wireless**\nactivity\n\n\n-----\n\n**Network Monitoring – Monitor the industrial network continually and non-intrusively without**\ncompromising factory operations\n\n###### 6.2 Security Assessments, Reporting, and Training\nThe Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team (ICS-CERT) was established to maintain\na database of security incidents, share mitigation methods, and provide training and tools for assessing risk\nwithin an ICS. If a security incident does occur, it is recommended that the incident be reported to ICSCERT. The ICS-CERT home page may be found at https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/.\n\n###### 6.3 Normative Security References\nFor more information on how to implement a security program within an industrial enterprise, the following\nguidelines and standards are available.\n\n###### [16] K.

Even in a mesh network in which multihop communications is intended, each hop should be designed to have LOS. Some devices are designed to\naccommodate non-line-of-sight (NLOS) communications; however, LOS is preferable to maximize\nreliability and reduce delay from retransmissions. In addition, obstructions such as those shown in the tank\nfarm in Figure 13 should be kept well out of the LOS path to avoid diffractive effects. A good rule of\nthumb to optimize performance in this case is to calculate the first Fresnel zone distance, F1, and assure that\nobjects do not come within that radius from the mid-point of the LOS path. The first Fresnel zone is\n\ncalculated as _F1_  d1d2 / (d1  _d2)_ where the wavelength  _c_ / _f_ . Distances are in meters. The\n\nconstant, _c, is the speed of light, which is_ 3 10 8 meters per second, and f is the transmit frequency in\nHz. In an indoor facility, obtaining the clearance is not always possible and will not usually become a root\ncause of serious link degradation. It should also be noted that the Fresnel zone equation is a function of\ndistance and wavelength. Lower frequency bands will convert to larger wavelengths and, therefore, have\nlarger Fresnel clearances. This has implications for densely populated indoor facilities in that lower\nfrequency RF deployments will not always perform better than higher-frequency deployments due to\nFresnel clearance as it would in a less dense outdoor installation. Testing of devices before final deployment\nwill confirm that performance requirements will be met.\n\n\nFigure 13. Antenna Height using the Fresnel Distance\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 7.2 Obstructions and Path Redundancy\nShadowing occurs when an object causes an electromagnetic blockage like a shadow caused by visible\nlight. Both visible light and RF waves are forms of electromagnetic radiation in the form of waves or\nphotons. An RF shadow is therefore a deep attenuation of the electromagnetic energy in a specific region\ncaused when RF waves are blocked. For example, when a large object, such as a commercial jetliner, rolls\ninto an area and sufficiently blocks the direct path between transmitter and receiver, the link between the\ntwo may be lost. In many circumstances, diffraction and multipath will serve to overcome a blockage of\nthe direct path with an increase in data loss or delay. Often the transmitted signal is attenuated beyond\nsignal recovery and another solution is required to maintain quality of service requirements.\n\nThe solution depends entirely on the wireless network being deployed and the minimum requirements for\nthe applications using the wireless network. One option includes transmitting from a different location.\nThis is often possible using lightweight access points in IEEE 802.11 and 802.15.4 networks; however,\nhand-off from one access point to the other can be too slow. Other options include a multi-hop solution as\nshown in Figure 14. Using a multi-hop solution could require anticipating the blockage and planning for\nan alternate fixed communication path or redundant path. Another solution would use a more active form\nof a mesh network in which nodes within the network maintain constant awareness of link quality and act\naccordingly. An IEEE 802.11 network that uses OSI layer 2 metrics can respond faster to changes in the\nenvironment than one that uses layer 3 metrics; however every networking technology has different\ncapabilities. The key concept here is the use of transmission path redundancy to improve the resilience of\nthe network to changes in the environment. Use path redundancy to improve network reliability within an\nenvironment where the RF characteristics can change. Most industrial environments fall into this category\nto some degree. Many wireless systems support path diversity, and including ISA100 Wireless,\nWirelessHART, Wi-Fi, ZigBee, and proprietary solutions.\n\n###### shadow RX\n\nTX1\n\n###### Transmitter\n\n\nTX1\n\n\n###### Relay\n\n\nTX1\n\n\nFigure 14. Overcoming Shadowing\n\n\nTX2\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 7.3 Difficult-To-Reach Locations\nNarrow corridors, tight spaces, areas occluded with machines, and applications low to the ground make\nwireless connectivity difficult. Many industrial applications require connectivity with hard to reach areas.\nRunning cables is often not an option making wireless the only option. Examples include rows of machines\nwith overhead gantry systems in an automobile assembly factory as shown in Figure 15. In this scenario,\ntwo rows of machines create a canyon effect. If a wireless device is stationed within the canyon,\nconnectivity to the device would be unreliable. One option would be to raise the antenna height of the\nwireless device such that a LOS connection is possible; however, not all devices or antennas can be moved\nor relocated. Another possible solution makes use of the multipath environment. Machines are often\nenclosed in highly reflective metal boxes. Since RF signals reflect well off most flat metal surfaces,\nantennas could be positioned to make use of the reflected energy.\n\nIn the figure, Antenna 1 uses the reflected energy off the adjacent machine to maintain connection with the\naccess point mounted on the wall. Antenna 2, must be positioned higher since the adjacent wall is made of\nconcrete which is not a good RF reflector. If the wall happened to be made of sheet metal, then it would\nbe possible to use multi-path in the same way as Antenna 1. An important consideration is how often the\nlayout of the factory changes. Frequent changes in the location of machines could make such an installation\nmore prone to quality of service fluctuations.\n\n###### 1 2\n\nFigure 15. Overcoming Metal Canyons\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 7.4 Non-Production Emitters such as Microwave Ovens\nMany common devices such as microwave ovens, cell phone hotspots, automobile hotspots, video games,\nbaby monitors, personal Bluetooth devices, and others will emit RF energy. These devices can interfere\nwith factory wireless operations, and steps should be taken to mitigate impacts through technological,\neducational, and policy enforcement. The microwave oven is discussed in this section. Microwave ovens\nare an important source of RF interference. Because these devices generate electromagnetic waves within\nthe 2400 MHz ISM band where many industrial wireless networks operate, they can severely degrade the\nperformance of the networks by introducing RF interference. The amount of interference will depend on\nthe proximity of the ovens to the network devices. Industrial networks will often experience network\nfailures during scheduled lunch breaks when one or more microwave ovens are used for extended periods\nof time. To reduce or eliminate the impacts of microwave ovens on an industrial wireless network, the\nfollowing steps should be followed. Some of these steps are illustrated in Figure 16.\n\n**Distance - Keep microwave ovens in a room far away from the industrial operation. The intensity of the**\nmicrowave oven interference will decrease with distance.\n\n**Oven Quality – Chose microwave ovens that are high quality and well shielded. A commercial rating does**\nnot indicate quality or shielding capability. Testing microwave ovens for interference levels at\nprogressively increasing distance using a spectrum analyzer may be of benefit.\n\n**Containing Room – Place the ovens in a designated room such as a lunch room or adjacent room with a**\nmetal door. If the room is near to the factory operation, it may be necessary to shield the room. Metal foil\ncan be applied to walls, doors, and windows to contain the interference but can be a costly investment.\nWindows can be covered or shielded to prevent interference leakage.\n\n**Change RF Band – Move the factory wireless network to another band such as 900 MHz band or 5 GHz.**\nMicrowave ovens impact the upper half of the 2.4 GHz ISM band more than the lower half[20]; therefore,\nit may be possible to limit the operation of the industrial wireless network to channels at the lower end of\nthe 2.4 GHz band, for example, channels below 2.44 GHz.\n\n**Cleaning – Keeping microwave ovens clean can prevent EM leakage.**\n\n\nFigure 16. Overcoming Microwave Oven Interference\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 7.5 Confined Space Gas Sensing and Safety Applications\nConfined spaces are present in many plants and factories. Tanks, large pipes, manholes, boilers, and\npainting rooms are examples of confined spaces. Various communications scenarios may occur at confined\nspaces including environment monitoring, voice communications, and human occupancy identifications.\nMost of these are safety-related applications and hence reliable communications are required.\n\nOne of the major safety applications in confined spaces is gas sensing and air quality monitoring. Generally,\nconfined spaces present a threat to safety from the accumulation of poisonous or combustible gases such as\noxygen, carbon monoxide, benzene, and hydrogen sulfide. Confined spaces have poor ventilation leading\nto gas accumulation. It is also difficult to evacuate personnel when a dangerous situation does occur.\nWireless gas sensors are used for the detection of gases prior to entering a confined space and for continuous\nmonitoring to maintain continuous safety. While wireless sensors are a useful technology to help maintain\na safe working environment, it is important to understand the challenges of wireless when used in confined\nspaces. Figure 17 shows an illustration of a gas sensing in confined spaces. In this scenario, a man is\nwelding in a confined space. The welding torch is producing carbon monoxide gas. The entry to the space\nis small with an adjacent manhole and ladder. Evacuation from the space would be difficult if ventilation\nfails and poisonous gases accumulate. In this and similar scenarios, the following actions would help to\nmaintain safety using a wireless sensor network.\n\n**RF Environment – Understand the materials of the confined space and how radio waves propagate within**\nit. Spaces with metal walls will reflect radio waves whereas concrete will absorb the RF waves.\n\n**Testing – Understand latency and reliability of each wireless solution with thorough testing before using a**\nwireless gas sensing application in a live scenario. Sensor applications should support black-box testing.\n\n**Antenna Placement – Place sensors and relay nodes to maximize LOS communication. Align antennas to**\nmaximize receive power and polarization alignment.\n\n**Redundancy – Use multiple sensors within the confined space in case one fails.**\n\n\n**Intrinsic Safety – Select wireless devices that meet applicable intrinsic safety standards.**\n\n**Common Sense – Do not allow technology to override or replace common sense practices.**\n\n\nFigure 17. Wireless Sensors in Confined Spaces\n\n\n-----\n\nWithin the aerospace industry some mechanics work in difficult conditions inside commercial aircraft\nconfined spaces such as fuel tanks and wing structure. To protect their safety, a two-way radio is assigned\nto each employee and checked out through a registration process. A responsible attendant monitors all the\nentrants at a command center by periodically sending communication signals and text messages to them. A\ntypical work effort in confined space involves handling sealants and chemicals thereby requiring constant\nsurveillance. Gas detectors may use multiple sensors looking for oxygen level and presence of hazardous\ngases such as carbon monoxide. Other requirements may include lower explosive level detectors, and photo\nionization sensors engineered to detect volatile organic compounds. The safety devices continuously\nmonitor the air quality and transmit text and voice data. In addition, Bluetooth beacons communicate with\nentrant radios to report the location of the workers within the factory. In emergency situations such as\nbuilding evacuation, the wireless safety system will inform the employees to leave their work areas.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 8 REFERENCES\n\n[1] R.
