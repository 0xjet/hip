The PassCV group continues to be one of the most successful and active threat groups\nthat leverage a wide array of stolen Authenticode-signing certificates.\n\n[Snorre Fagerland of Blue Coat Systems first coined the term PassCV in a blog post. His post provides](https://www.bluecoat.com/security-blog/2014-07-21/korean-gaming-industry-still-under-fire)\na good introduction to the group and covers some of the older infrastructure, stolen code-signing\ncertificate reuse, and other connections associated with the PassCV malware. There are several clues\nalluding to the possibility that multiple groups may be utilizing the same stolen signing certificates, but\nat this time SPEAR believes the current attacks are more likely being perpetrated by a single group\nemploying multiple publicly available Remote Administration Tools (RATs).\n\nThe PassCV group has been operating with continued success and has already started to expand their\nmalware repertoire into different off-the-shelf RATs and custom code. SPEAR identified eighteen\npreviously undisclosed stolen Authenticode certificates. These certificates were originally issued to\ncompanies and individuals scattered across China, Taiwan, Korea, Europe, the United States and\nRussia.\n\nIn this post we expand the usage of the term 'PassCV' to encompass the malware mentioned in the\nBlue Coat Systems report, as well as the APT group behind the larger C2 infrastructure and stolen\nAuthenticode certificates. We’d like to share some of our findings as they pertain to the stolen\ncertificates, command and control infrastructure, and some of the newer custom RATs they’ve begun\ndevelopment on.\n\n## PassCV Background\n\nThe PassCV group typically utilized publicly available RATs in addition to some custom code, which\nultimately provided backdoor functionality to affected systems via phony resumes and curriculum vitae\n(CVs). PassCV continues to maintain a heavy reliance on obfuscated and signed versions of older\n\n\n-----\n\nRATs like ZxShell and Ghost RAT, which have remained a favorite of the wider Chinese criminal\ncommunity since their initial public release.\n\nSPEAR identified recent PassCV samples which implemented another commercial off-the-shelf (COTS)\nRAT called Netwire. This tool offers the attacker full control of the victim/host and is perhaps best\nknown for its cross-platform compatibility, which includes support for Windows, Linux, OSX, and Solaris.\n\nOverall, the antivirus (AV) industry has barely kept pace with the PassCV group, and although some\nsamples and families are well detected, the majority of the signed samples continue to have extremely\nlow detection rates.\n\nSPEAR was able to identify several other distinct malware families that we believe to be related to the\nPassCV group based upon common stolen Authenticode certificates. The Kitkiot and Sabresac (also\nknown as Saber or Excalibur based upon strings in the binaries) malware families were deployed by the\ngroup for distinct purposes.\n\nSaber is a custom RAT that periodically queries a web-based C2 server for commands. The only active\ninstances SPEAR was able to identify were hosted on the Chinese code development site\n'csdn(dot)net'. Kitkiot variants are commonly installed alongside other types of malware and often\nincluded additional functionality, including:\n\nDenial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) capabilities\nThe ability to hijack and steal in-game account information and items from multiple online gaming\nplatforms\nIn some rare cases these were used for click-through advertising fraud.\n\n## The Saber Family\n\nThe Saber malware utilizes a custom base64 alphabet for decoding messages from its C2 servers. The\nmalware will decode an obfuscated string found on the site it has been programmed to contact. It will\nthen communicate to the actual C2 for further instructions to execute. SPEAR only observed samples\nthat employed clear-text communication between the victim and the actual C2. The malware accepts\nany windows shell command the attackers pass back via the C2.\n\nTo start the C2 process, Saber samples commonly used blogs on the Chinese-based information\ntechnology and development website ‘blog.csdn[dot]net’. The malware executes an HTTP GET request\nto one or more blog page(s). The malware then looks for the string format 'saberstart.\n<encoded_string>.saberend' in the response data once the link is retrieved. The data stored between\nthe strings 'saberstart.' and '.saberend' is encoded with a custom Base64 alphabet which contains a\nfollow-on C2 address and a port separated with an uppercase 'W'.\n\nSPEAR developed the following Python snippet to aid in decoding the Saber C2 messages:\n\n\n-----\n\nFig1-PassCV-FIXED.jpg\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1: Python Script to Decode Saber C2 Messages_\n\n## The exact URLs varied among samples, but SPEAR was able to identify the following C2 URLs:\n\n**URL: http://blog.csdn[dot]net/u013761036/article/details/45542243**\n\n**Contained: saberstart.1QXO3Q1s3pfN3Qbu1/fN5pb/ahES+mEMaMSLcgSTjNIPch0PIz.saberend**\n\n**Accessed: 814,896 times = Number of page visits at the time of writing**\n\n**Decodes to: gotofindsocketsvcW118.123.19.9W25965#**\n\n**URL: http://blog.csdn[dot]net//saber00001//article//details//50444103**\n\n**Contained: saberstart.1QXO3Q1s3pfN3Qbu1/fN5pb/ahIN+mIOcgSR+mIMbo4MbhnSala.saberend**\n\n**Accessed: 2,167,985 times = Number of page visits at the time of writing**\n\n**Decodes to: gotofindsocketsvcW123.249.7.226W25982#**\n\n**URL: http://blog.csdn[dot]net//saber00002//article//details//50444149**\n\n**Contained: saberstart.1QXO3Q1s3pfN3Qbu1/fN5pb/ahIN+mIOcgSR+mIMbo4MbhnSala.saberend**\n\n**Accessed: 1,257,722 times = Number of page visits at the time of writing**\n\n**Decodes to: gotofindsocketsvcW123.249.7.226W25982#**\n\n**URL: http://blog.csdn[dot]net//saber00003//article//details//50444185**\n\n**Contained: saberstart.IQ5y5GXp2kTn4QXm2QjO4R1mjNEMaMSMbDnxcDExamAMjNIPch8PIz.saberend**\n**Accessed: 474,514 times = Number of page visits at the time of writing**\n\n**Decodes to: #gotofindsocketsvcW123.249.81.202W25985#**\n\n**URL: http://blog.csdn[dot]net//saber00004//article//details//50444188**\n\n**Contained: saberstart.IQ5y5GXp2kTn4QXm2QjO4R1mjNEMaMSMbDnxcDExamAMjNIPch8PIz.saberend**\n**Accessed: 486,925 times = Number of page visits at the time of writing**\n\n**Decodes to: #gotofindsocketsvcW123.249.81.202W25985#**\n\n**URL: http://blog.csdn[dot]net//asdasdasdasddadasd//article//details//50443203**\n\n**Contained: saberstart.1QXO3Q1s3pfN3Qbu1/fN5pb/ahES+mEMaMSLcgSTjNIPch0PIz.saberend**\n\n**Accessed: 3,333,320 times = Number of page visits at the time of writing**\n\n**Decodes to: gotofindsocketsvcW118.123.19.9W25965#'**\n\n**URL: http://blog.csdn[dot]net//dasdmkdwovcs//article//details//50925619**\n\n**Contained: saberstart.1QXO3Q1s3pfN3Qbu1/fN5pb/ahIN+mIOcgSR+mIMbo4MbhnSala.saberend**\n\n**Accessed: 7,475,132 times = Number of page visits at the time of writing**\n\n**Decodes to: gotofindsocketsvcW123.249.7.226W25982#**\n\n**URL: http://blog.csdn[dot]net//u013761036/article/details/45542243**\n\n**Contained: saberstart.1QXO3Q1s3pfN3Qbu1/fN5pb/ahES+mEMaMSLcgSTjNIPch0PIz.saberend**\n\n**Accessed: 983,239 times = Number of page visits at the time of writing**\n\n**Decodes to: gotofindsocketsvcW118.123.19.9W25965#**\n\nSPEAR was able to successfully emulate the remote C2 server, and during testing we were able to\nsend and remotely execute any command on the (hypothetical) victim system.\n\n## Saber Relationships\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile researching the Saber family we found a similar .PDB file path in several samples:\n\n**\"F:\\\\Excalibur\\\\Excalibur\\\\Excalibur\\\\bin\\\\oSaberSvc.pdb\"**\n**\"D:\\\\Excalibur\\\\Excalibur\\\\Excalibur\\\\bin\\\\oSaberSvc.pdb\"**\n**\"F:\\\\Excalibur\\\\Excalibur\\\\Excalibur\\\\bin\\\\Shell.pdb\"**\n\nThe malware author originally employed the username ‘Excalibur_C’ (similar to the .PDB file paths)\nwhen creating the C2 page:\n\n**‘http://blog.csdn[dot]net/u013761036/article/details/45542243’**\n\nThis was the earliest post that SPEAR was able to identify that contained the encoded Saber\ncommands, with a post date of 2015-05-06 22:20. The same author made numerous other\nprogramming related posts in addition to this page:\n\n\n-----\n\nFig3-PassCV.png\n\n\n-----\n\n## Figure 2: Excalibur Blog Posts\n\nSince the time we first started working on this write-up, the Saber author has presumably gained some\nadditional attention and it seems the username and icon on the blog were changed as a result:\n\n\n-----\n\nFig4-PassCV.png\n\n\n-----\n\n## Figure 3: Excalibur s New Username\n\nSPEAR also identified a newer variant during our investigation and subsequent write-up. The compile\ntimestamp indicated that the sample was compiled on August 3, 2016. The newer variant leveraged two\ndifferent domains:\n\n**‘d26yaxxlnmhaem(dot)cloudfront.net’**\n**‘d1wmnlsnh8rftl(dot)cloudfront.net’**\n\nThe variant also downloaded additional 7-Zip self-extracting archives that ultimately installed the Saber\nmalware onto the infected system. Several other signed variants have also been distributed from the\ndomain:\n\n**‘dhd29up7zcdyt(dot)cloudfront.net’**\n\n‘Cloudfront.net’ belongs to Amazon’s content delivery network, Amazon CloudFront. This recent move\ncould indicate the attackers are looking for a more robust means of distribution to continue spreading\ntheir malware.\n\n## The Kitkiot family\n\nKitkiot malware has been publicly linked to the ‘dns-syn[dot]com’ domain which has direct ties to the\ngroup courtesy of Blue Coat Systems’ research. Kitkiot provides backdoor functionality and is\ncommonly installed alongside other types of malware. It has previously been documented and used to\nperform DDoS attacks, function as a proxy server and perform click-through advertising fraud. We\nfound numerous instances in which Kitkiot variants were written specifically to target online gaming\nplatforms and modify values stored in databases and other online network communications.\n\nExisting public information about this malware family is available via these links:\n\n[https://www.threatcrowd.org/listMalware.php?antivirus=Trojan.Kitkiot](https://www.threatcrowd.org/listMalware.php?antivirus=Trojan.Kitkiot)\n\n[http://www.virusradar.com/en/Win32_Kitkiot.A/description](http://www.virusradar.com/en/Win32_Kitkiot.A/description)\n\n## Stolen Certificates and Relationships to PassCV\n\nSPEAR identified roughly eighteen previously undisclosed stolen Authenticode certificates.\nInterestingly, not all of the certificates were stolen from game companies. It appeared the group had\nalso started to branch out into signed adware. This may seem odd at first, but most security\nresearchers are somewhat numb to the consistent barrage of so-called legitimately signed adware, so a\nmore advanced backdoor signed with the same certificate could easily be overlooked.\n\nThe first new connection SPEAR identified was derived from an email address listed in Blue Coat\nSystems' original report on PassCV. The email address ‘13581641274(at)163.com’ which was used to\nregister the domain ‘aresgame[dot]info’ was reused in 2015 to register the domains\n‘fengzigame[dot]net’ and ‘roboscan[dot]net’. Both domains were designed to look like their legitimate\ncounterparts, ‘fengzigame.com’ and ‘roboscan.com’.\n\nSPEAR found several NetWire variants that communicated to subdomains off of the aforementioned\ndomains, and identified another larger cluster of activity that was specifically targeted at game\ndevelopers using similar variants. All of the variants communicated to domains that were\n\n\n-----\n\n**extremely similar to other popular gaming framework websites, and contained code to harvest**\n**stored password information as well as log keystroke data.**\n\nThe C2 domain ‘cocoss2d[dot]com’ mimicked the original website for the Cocos2d gaming framework,\n‘http://cocos2d.org/’, used in popular mobile games such as Badland. The C2 domain\n‘unitys3d[dot]com’ was designed to impersonate the website of the Unity engine, ‘https://unity3d.com/’,\na gaming engine licensed across multiple gaming platforms and more recently in popular mobile games\nlike Pokémon Go.\n\nMany of the identified samples also contained a common unique mutex, ‘{332222A-33A3-2222-AAAA3A22AA333}’, which allowed SPEAR to identify a number of additional compromised certificates.\n\nOne of the samples identified through this method was:\n\n**95a33b0c5f2408adabbebeba6f4c618ba2b392f9dbcd1d9a9ff9db5a519380d8**\n\nThis led to the discovery of another sample:\n\n**ad2a42e4024a320ce763524e17ef7262add649651e2a277b5fc56a9bdc44e449**\n\nIt was signed with a certificate belonging to AmazGame, a Beijing-based gaming company. The sample\nalso contacted the domain ‘waw.css2[dot]com’, intended to mimic another domain related to the\nCascading Style Sheets 2.0 specification:\n\n\n-----\n\nFig9-PassCV.png\n\n\n-----\n\n## Figure 4: Beijing AmazGame Certificate\n\n**Issued to: Beijing AmazGame Age Internet Technology Co.**\n**Current Status:** _Not time valid_\n**Valid From: 3/16/2012 1:00 AM 6/16/2015 12:59 AM**\n**Thumbprint: B585EA81A25908F25F39088B1FCC239EBF7088D8**\n**Serial Number: 22 CF 7D A7 B7 6F C5 C4 E7 72 25 CF A1 BD A4 97**\n\nThis in turn led to the discovery of a similar binary via C2 crossover:\n\n**78b588fa57b027cda856a05638b25454c59d1896670701f9a8177b8e0c39596d**\n\n\n-----\n\nIt was signed with yet another stolen Authenticode certificate:\n\nFig10-PassCV.png\n\n\n-----\n\n## Figure 5: Syncopate Authenticode Certificate\n\n Issued to: Syncopate LLC\n\n Current Status: Valid\n\n**Valid From: 9/24/2015 1:00 AM to 12/24/2017 12:59 AM**\n\n**Thumbprint: 59EE1A00910451130BB22E06DEB5DCAF1AFAA282**\n\n**Serial Number: 7E 12 57 33 28 AD F4 5B 6F 3E C3 41 E6 46 29 3A**\n\nSyncopate is a well-known Russian company that is best known as the developer and operator of the\n‘GameNet’ platform. [GameNet was first identified as being a likely victim of the Winnti group here,](https://securelist.com/blog/research/57585/winnti-faq-more-than-just-a-game/)\nalthough no associated code-signing certificates were identified at that time. Similarly, in that same blog\npost ‘Zemi Interactive’ was also identified as being a likely victim from the same attacks. The evidence\n**presented above strengthens the claim that the Winnti and PassCV groups are closely related.**\n\nDuring the course of this investigation, SPEAR also identified that NHN’s (Naver Corporation) codesigning certificates were compromised, but it appeared to be related to a substantially different attack\nset that SPEAR hopes to shed some light on in the near future.\n\nBlue Coat Systems originally identified additional connections based upon domain registrant\ninformation with the email addresses ‘huise123(at)yahoo.com’ and ‘rebot(at)126.com’. It is possible that\nthe original stolen code-signing certificates were shared among multiple groups and only more recently\ndeployed by the attackers. However, SPEAR has not found any significant evidence to support this\nhypothesis.\n\nSPEAR identified another sample:\n\n**dff0fee3bef9fa2c9c08a6d2c5772e51c1d29522de19301fb389b310e481713f**\n\nIt was signed using the Beijing AmazGame certificate. The sample beaconed back to the domain\n‘task.dns-syn[dot]com’. ‘bot[dot]dns-syn[dot]com’ was previously documented in Blue Coat Systems’\nwrite-up as being registered using the email address ‘rebot(at)126.com’. This email address was\nsubsequently linked to the domain ‘timewalk[dot]me’, which was documented in other RATs associated\nwith the Winnti group.\n\nThis particular subdomain served a unique purpose, which was to provide additional tasking and to\ninstruct the malware to target a specific online gaming platform. In the case of this particular sample,\nthe targeted gaming platform was 'http://20012.com/'. After analysis of several other similar signed\nsamples, SPEAR found they were all targeted at various individual online and mobile gaming platforms.\n\nSPEAR was able to identify additional samples that utilized these stolen Authenticode certificates,\nwhich created an interesting pivot point and led to the discovery of several additional compromised\ncertificates.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n\n-----\n\nThe PassCV group continues to be extremely effective in compromising both small and large game\ncompanies and surreptitiously using their code-signing certificates to infect an even larger swath of\norganizations. Since the last report, the group has significantly expanded its targets to include\n**victims in the United States, Taiwan, China and Russia.**\n\nSPEAR researchers were surprised to find that a good portion of the old infrastructure exposed by Blue\nCoat Systems remains active to this day. However, it was also apparent that the attackers paid attention\nto the news, as they let several of the exposed domains lapse and registered extremely similar domains\nshortly thereafter. The overall operational security of the group has also improved and more recent\ndomains were registered using private WHOIS services and other previously undisclosed email\naddresses.\n\nInterestingly, most of the malicious binaries were countersigned, which allowed the expired certificates\nto continue to be valid long past their expiration date. SPEAR has time and time again observed that\n**this particular “feature” of Microsoft Authenticode Certificates is easily and readily abused by**\n**malicious actors. Even** [some recent academic papers pointed out that the binary’s Authenticode](https://software.imdea.org/~juanca/papers/malsign_ccs15.pdf)\ncertificate will continue to be valid if a malicious binary is time stamped (countersigned), validly signed\nand the certificate is subsequently revoked. SPEAR has not identified any samples related to the\nPassCV group that would support the author of the paper’s conclusion, but samples of this nature\nwould indicate that Authenticode signing is indeed rather broken.\n\n**While the motivations of the attackers aren’t entirely clear, SPEAR believes that the attackers**\n**are most likely profiting financially in some way. This could include subverting the in-game**\n**economies of the companies they compromise, reselling the stolen code-signing certificates,**\n**offering malware signing services or by creating their own private VPN infrastructure from**\n**machines within the compromised organizations.**\n\nSPEAR identified one binary in particular that fueled this speculation:\n\n**8748c19ec86011a77e313e0ea9dd9d0315eed274288585f3663f57e5b8960bdf**\n\nThe binary was signed with the stolen code-signing certificate from Beijing ‘AmazGame’ and was\nnamed ‘Proxy.exe’. The file communicated with a website ‘www.proxy456(dot)com’, registered using the\nemail-address ‘plus3k(at)gmail.com’.
