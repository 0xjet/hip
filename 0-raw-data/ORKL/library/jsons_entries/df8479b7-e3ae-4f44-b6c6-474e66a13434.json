Famous for\n[stealing scripts from HBO’s Game of Thrones in 2017 and suspected of interfering in the](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/09/10/cyberattacks-us-elections-trump-biden/)\nU.S. presidential election last year, it has launched extensive campaigns against\norganizations and officials across North America and the Middle East. Public attribution\n[has associated APT35 with an Iran-based nation state threat actor.](https://www.cfr.org/cyber-operations/apt-35)\n\n[Darktrace regularly detects attacks by many known threat actors including Evil Corp and](https://www.darktrace.com/en/blog/evil-corp-intrusions-wasted-locker-ransomware-detected-by-darktrace)\n[APT41, alongside large amounts of malicious but uncategorized activity from](https://www.darktrace.com/en/blog/catching-apt-41-exploiting-a-zero-day-vulnerability)\n[sophisticated attack groups. As Cyber AI doesn’t rely on predefined rules, signatures, or](https://www.darktrace.com/en/cyber-ai)\nthreat intelligence to detect cyber-attacks, it often detects new and previously unknown\nthreats.\n\nThis blog post examines a real-world instance of APT35 activity in an organization in the\nEMEA region. Darktrace observed this activity last June, but due to ongoing\ninvestigations, details are only now being released with the wider community. It\nrepresents an interesting case for the value of self-learning AI in two key ways:\n\n**Identifying ‘low and slow’ attacks: How do you spot an attacker that is lying**\nlow and conducts very little detectable activity?\n\n**Detecting pre-existing infections without signatures: What if a threat actor**\nis already inside the system when Cyber AI is activated?\n\n\n-----\n\n## Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) lying low\n\nAPT35 had already infected a single corporate device, likely via a spear phishing email,\nwhen Cyber AI was deployed in the company’s digital estate for the first time.\n\nThe infected device exhibited no other signs of malicious activity beyond continued\ncommand and control (C2) beaconing, awaiting instructions from the attackers for\nseveral days. This is what we call ‘lying low’ – where the hacker stays present within a\nsystem, but remains under the radar, avoiding detection either intentionally, or because\nthey’re focusing on another victim while being content with backdoor access into the\norganization.\n\nEither way, this is a nightmare scenario for a security team and any security vendor: an\nAPT which has established a foothold and is lying in wait to continue their attack –\nundetected.\n\n## Finding the infected device\n\nWhen Darktrace’s AI was first activated, it spent five business days learning the unique\n‘patterns of life’ for the organization. After this initial, short learning period, Darktrace\nimmediately flagged the infected device and the C2 activity.\n\nAlthough the breach device had been beaconing since before Darktrace was implemented,\nCyber AI automatically clusters devices into ‘peer groups’ based on similar behavioral\npatterns, enabling Darktrace to identify the continued C2 traffic coming from the device\nas highly unusual in comparison to the wider, automatically identified peer group. None\nof its behaviorally close neighbors were doing anything remotely similar, and Darktrace\nwas therefore able to determine that the activity was malicious, and that it represented C2\nbeaconing.\n\nDarktrace detected the APT35 C2 activity without the use of any signatures or threat\nintelligence on multiple levels. Responding to the alerts, the internal security team\nquickly isolated the device and verified with the Darktrace system that no further\nreconnaissance, lateral movement, or data exfiltration had taken place.\n\n## APT35 ‘Charming Kitten’ analysis\n\n[Once the C2 was detected, Cyber AI Analyst immediately began analyzing the infected](https://www.darktrace.com/en/products/cyber-ai-analyst)\ndevice. The Cyber AI Analyst only highlights the most severe incidents in any given\nenvironment and automates many of the typical level one and level two SOC tasks. This\nincludes reviewing all alerts, investigating the scope and nature of each event, and\nreducing time to triage by 92%.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1: Similar Cyber AI Analyst report observing C2 communications\n\nNumerous factors made the C2 activity stand out strongly to Darktrace. Combining all\nthose small anomalies, Darktrace was able to autonomously prioritize this behavior and\nclassify it as the most significant security incident in the week.\n\nFigure 2: Example list of C2 detections for an APT35 attack\n\nSome of the command and control destinations were known to threat intelligence and\nopen-source intelligence (OSINT) – for instance, the domain cortanaservice[.]com is a\n[known C2 domain for APT35.](https://www.tra.gov.ae/assets/FPqDOwpi.pdf.aspx)\n\n\n-----\n\nHowever, the presence of a known malicious domain does not guarantee detection. In\nfact, the organization had a very mature security stack, yet they failed to discover the\nexisting APT35 infection until Darktrace was activated in their environment.\n\n## Assessing the impact of the intrusion\n\nOnce an intrusion has been identified, it is important to understand the extent of it – such\nas whether lateral movement is occurring and what connectivity the infected device has in\ngeneral. Asset management is never perfect, so it can be very hard for organizations to\ndetermine what damage a compromised device is capable of inflicting.\n\nDarktrace presents this information in real time, and from a bird’s-eye perspective,\nmaking the assessment very simple. It immediately highlights which subnet the device is\nlocated in and any further context.\n\nFigure 3: Darktrace’s Threat Visualizer displaying the connectivity of a device\n\nBased on this information, the organization confirmed that it was a corporate device that\nhad been infected by APT35. As Darktrace shows any credentials associated with the\ndevice, a quick assessment could be made of potentially compromised accounts.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4: Similar and associated credentials of a device\n\nLuckily, only a single local user account was associated with the device.\n\nThe exact level of privileges and connectivity which the infected device had, as well as the\nextent to which the intrusion might have spread from the initially infected device, was\nstill uncertain. By looking at the device’s event log, this became rapidly clear within\nminutes.\n\nFiltering first for internal connections only (excluding any connections going to the\nInternet) gave a good idea of the level of connectivity of the device. A cursory glance\nshowed that the device did indeed have some level of internal connectivity. It made DNS\nrequests to the internal domain controller and was making successful NetBIOS\nconnections over ports 135 and 139 internally.\n\nBy filtering further in the event log, it quickly became clear that in this time the device\nhad not used any administrative channels, such as RDP, SSH, Telnet, or SMB. This is a\nstrong indicator that no lateral movement over common channels had taken place.\n\nIt is more difficult to assess whether the device was performing any other suspicious\nactivity, like stealthy reconnaissance or staging data from other internal devices.\nDarktrace provided another capability to assess this quickly – filtering the device’s\nnetwork connections to show only unusual or new connections.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5: Event device log filtered to show unusual connections only\n\nDarktrace assesses each individual connection for every entity observed in context, using\nits unsupervised machine learning to evaluate how unusual a given connection is. This\ncould be a single new failed internal connection attempt, indicating stealthy\nreconnaissance, or a connection over SMB at an unusual time to a new internal\ndestination, implying lateral movement or data staging.\n\nBy filtering for only unusual or new connections, Darktrace’s AI produces further leads\nthat can be pursued extremely quickly, thanks to the context and added visibility.\n\nNo further suspicious internal connections were observed, strengthening the hypothesis\nthat ATP35 was lying low at that time.\n\n## Unprecedented but not unpreventable\n\nDarktrace’s 24/7 monitoring service, Proactive Threat Notifications, would have alerted\n[on and escalated the incident. Darktrace Antigena would have responded autonomously](https://www.darktrace.com/en/products/antigena-network)\nand enforced normal activity for the device, preventing the C2 traffic without interrupting\nregular business workflows.\n\nIt is impossible to predefine where the next attack will come from. APT35 is just one of\nthe many sophisticated threat actors on the scene, and with such a diverse and volatile\nthreat landscape, unsupervised machine learning is crucial in spotting and defending\nagainst anomalies, no matter what form they take.\n\nThis case study helps illustrate how Darktrace detects pre-existing infections and ‘low and\nslow’ attacks, and further shows how Darktrace can be used to quickly understand the\nscope and extent of an intrusion.\n\n[Learn how Cyber AI Analyst detected APT41 two weeks before public attribution](https://www.darktrace.com/en/blog/catching-apt-41-exploiting-a-zero-day-vulnerability)\n\n**Shortened list of C2 detections over four days on the infected device:**\n\nCompromise / Sustained TCP Beaconing Activity To Rare Endpoint\nCompromise / Beaconing Meta Model\n\n\n-----\n\nCompromise / Beaconing Activity To External Rare\nCompromise / SSL Beaconing To Rare Destination\nCompromise / Slow Beaconing To External Rare\nCompromise / High Volume of Connections with Beacon Score\nCompromise / Unusual Connections to Rare Lets Encrypt\nCompromise / Beacon for 4 Days\nCompromise / Agent Beacon\n\n**Observed C2 destinations:**\n\nCortanaservice[.]com, port 443, beacon intervals at 100 seconds\n\n## Max Heinemeyer\n\nMax is a cyber security expert with over a decade of experience in the field, specializing in\na wide range of areas such as Penetration Testing, Red-Teaming, SIEM and SOC\nconsulting and hunting Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups.
