Also known as EXOTIC\nLILY, Projector Libra is a criminal group that uses file sharing services to distribute malware\nafter direct email correspondence with a potential victim. Projector Libra has been reported\nas [an initial access broker with ties to Conti ransomware.](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/exposing-initial-access-broker-ties-conti/)\n\nThis blog presents a case study from recent Bumblebee malware activity distributed through\nProjector Libra that led to Cobalt Strike. Information presented here should provide a clearer\npicture of the group’s tactics and help security professionals better defend their organizations\nagainst this threat\n\n\n-----\n\n[Palo Alto Networks customers are protected from Bumblebee with Cortex XDR or our](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cortex/cortex-xdr) NextGeneration Firewall with [WildFire and](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/secure-the-network/wildfire) [Threat Prevention subscriptions.](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/threat-prevention)\n\nFull visualization of the techniques observed, relevant courses of action and IoCs related to\n[this report can be found in the Unit 42 ATOM viewer.](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/atoms/projector-libra/)\n\nPrimary Malware Discussed Bumblebee\n\nPrimary Threat Actors Discussed Projector Libra/EXOTIC LILY\n\nOperating System Affected Windows\n\nRelated Unit 42 Topics [Malware,](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/category/malware-2/) [phishing](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/tag/phishing/)\n\n## Table of Contents\n\nBumblebee Replaces BazarLoader\n\nTactics of Threat Actor Projector Libra\n\nExamples of Email Messages\n\nMalware and Traffic From an Infection\n\nConclusion\n\nIndicators of Compromise\n\nAdditional Resources\n\n## Bumblebee Replaces BazarLoader\n\n[Bumblebee malware](https://research.nccgroup.com/2022/04/29/adventures-in-the-land-of-bumblebee-a-new-malicious-loader/) [replaced BazarLoader sometime in February 2022. Since then,](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/bumblebee-is-still-transforming)\ncampaigns that formerly distributed BazarLoader are now distributing Bumblebee instead.\n\nBumblebee’s predecessor first appeared as early as April 2020, when developers behind\nTrickbot released a new malware called BazarBackdoor. The loader component of this\nmalware was dubbed BazarLoader, and BazarLoader was a notable part of our threat\nlandscape throughout 2020 and 2021.\n\nDuring the summer of 2021, BazarLoader reached peak distribution with at least three\ncampaigns pushing the majority of samples. These campaigns/threat actors were TA551\n(Shathak), TA578 (Contact Forms/Stolen Images Evidence) and a call center-assisted\n[campaign nicknamed BazarCall.](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/bazarloader-malware/)\n\nBazarLoader remained active through February 2022, but no newly created samples have\n[been discovered since then. Starting in March 2022, threat actors like Projector Libra who](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/exposing-initial-access-broker-ties-conti/)\nhad been distributing BazarLoader switched to pushing a new malware family called\nBumblebee. Security researchers dubbed this malware Bumblebee because it uses\n“bumblebee” in the user-agent string generated during post-infection HTTPS traffic.\n\n\n-----\n\nThreat actors like TA578 previously switched between distributing BazarLoader or\ndistributing IcedID (Bokbot) malware. Since March 2022, these threat actors have stopped\n[pushing BazarLoader. For example, TA578 now switches between pushing Bumblebee or](https://twitter.com/Unit42_Intel/status/1521831026024239107)\n[pushing IcedID.](https://twitter.com/Unit42_Intel/status/1524474195471745028)\n\nMalware distribution patterns reveal Bumblebee continues where BazarLoader left off, which\nincludes pushing follow-up malware like Cobalt Strike that can eventually lead to a\nransomware infection.\n\n## Tactics of Threat Actor Projector Libra\n\nGoogle’s Threat Analysis Group (TAG) previously presented a full attack chain for this threat\nactor, but our case example begins with the first contact a potential victim receives from this\nthreat actor.\n\nFigure 1. Chain of events for this case study.\nIf a potential victim responds to the initial email, Projector Libra sends a reply stating a\nseparate email has been sent through a file sharing service to provide a file relevant to the\ndiscussion. The victim then receives an email generated by the file sharing service. These\nemails contain a link hosting malware disguised as a file discussed in the previous Projector\nLibra message.\n\nSince 2022, files pushed by Projector Libra have been ISO images. These images are\ndesigned to infect a vulnerable Windows host. They contain a WIndows shortcut, and this\nshortcut is designed to run Bumblebee malware hidden in the same ISO.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn some cases, the ISO image contains a Windows shortcut (.LNK file) that runs a hidden\nDLL file for Bumblebee.\n\nIn other cases, the ISO image contains a Bumblebee DLL contained within a passwordprotected 7-Zip archive (.7Z file). In these cases, the LNK file runs a hidden copy of the 7-Zip\nstandalone console to extract Bumblebee from its password-protected 7Z file.\n\nIn an Active Directory (AD) environment, an initial Bumblebee infection leads to Cobalt\nStrike. Attackers use Cobalt Strike to map the victim’s environment. If the results reveal a\n[high-value target, attackers will attempt lateral movement and drop ransomware like Conti or](https://thedfirreport.com/2021/05/12/conti-ransomware/)\n[Diavol.](https://thedfirreport.com/2021/12/13/diavol-ransomware/)\n\n## Examples of Email Messages\n\nThe first event in our case study is an initial email sent by Projector Libra on May 5, 2022. It\nspoofs an employee named Andres from a regional gas company in the United States.\n\nFigure 2 shows a screenshot of this initial email.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2. Email from Projector Libra to establish correspondence.\nWhen a potential victim replied to the email shown above in Figure 2, Projector Libra\nresponded with the email shown below in Figure 3. This response states that a document\n[was sent through TransferXL in a separate email.](https://www.transferxl.com/)\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3. Response from Projector Libra after a potential victim replied to the initial email.\nTransferXL is a legitimate file-sharing service with a free tier. It is one of many file sharing\nservices with a free pricing category that are frequently abused by criminal groups like\nProjector Libra. These TransferXL URLs expire after one week, which helps conceal the\nmalware from security researchers. Below, Figure 4 shows a TransferXL email from this case\nstudy sharing malware provided by Projector Libra.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4. Email generated by TransferXL sharing malware from Projector Libra.\n\n## Malware and Traffic From an Infection\n\nFiles shared through TransferXL are compressed and sent as ZIP archives. Figure 5 shows\nthe TransferXL URL from this case study opened in a web browser and downloading\nmalware provided by Projector Libra.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5. TransferXL URL sending malware provided by Projector Libra.\nThe recipient extracts an ISO file from the TransferXL ZIP archive. In most GUI-based\ndesktop environments like Microsoft Windows, double-clicking an ISO file mounts it as a new\ndrive. In Windows 10, the downloaded ISO will mount as a DVD drive, similar to DVD Drive\nE: in Figure 6.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6. Downloaded ISO malware mounted as DVD Drive E: in WIndows 10.\nShown above in Figure 6, the downloaded ISO file contains a Windows shortcut named\nAttachments.lnk. In Microsoft Windows, the .lnk file extension remains hidden, even if File\nExplorer is set to show file extensions.\n\nAttachments.lnk executes a PowerShell command to run a copy of the 7-Zip standalone\nconsole file named 7za.exe. Above, Figure 6 displays the full PowerShell command from\nAttachments.lnk.\n\n\n-----\n\n7za.exe extracts the Bumblebee malware DLL from a password-protected 7-Zip archive\nnamed archive.7z. Both 7za.exe and archive.7z are hidden but can be revealed if File\nExplorer is configured to show hidden files.\n\nThe extracted Bumblebee DLL file is saved to C:\\ProgramData\\19a.dll, as shown below in\nFigure 7. The Bumblebee DLL is executed using rundll32 and oxgdXPSGPw as the\nEntryPoint.\n\nFigure 7. The extracted Bumblebee malware DLL file saved to disk.\nTraffic generated by this infection is all HTTPS. Below, Figure 8 shows the TransferXL URL\nused for this infection filtered in Wireshark. After the ISO was mounted and Bumblebee was\nexecuted, we saw Bumblebee HTTPS C2 traffic on 54.38.139[.]20:443.\n\nFigure 8. Traffic from the infection filtered in Wireshark.\nApproximately 15 minutes after Bumblebee C2 traffic began, we saw Cobalt Strike activity\nusing fuvataren[.]com on 45.153.243[.]142:443 as shown below in Figure 9.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 9. Cobalt Strike traffic seen during the infection.\nIn our case example and lab tests, Bumblebee infections frequently led to Cobalt Strike\nactivity. Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 has reported Cobalt Strike activity from Bumblebee\n[infections in the following tweets from our @Unit42_Intel handle on Twitter:](https://twitter.com/Unit42_Intel)\n\n[April 5, 2022](https://twitter.com/Unit42_Intel/status/1512146449345171459)\n[May 3, 2022](https://twitter.com/Unit42_Intel/status/1521831026024239107)\n[May 31, 2022](https://twitter.com/Unit42_Intel/status/1531690477568794626)\n[June 9, 2022](https://twitter.com/Unit42_Intel/status/1535267801384235008)\n[June 14, 2022](https://twitter.com/Unit42_Intel/status/1536820531227418630)\n\nIf the targeted environment is high-value, we might see further activity and possible lateral\nmovement. However, this case study did not provide a tempting target, and Cobalt Strike\ntraffic suddenly ended after one hour and 11 minutes.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBumblebee is currently distributed by Projector Libra and other threat actors that previously\npushed BazarLoader. Projector Libra runs a sophisticated campaign to establish\ncorrespondence with a potential victim before sending its malware using file sharing services\nlike TransferXL.\n\nMalware from Projector Libra currently consists of ISO images containing Windows shortcuts\nand hidden files to install Bumblebee malware. Bumblebee is designed to infect Windows\nhosts. In an AD environment, this frequently leads to Cobalt Strike, which can in turn lead to\na more serious ransomware infection.\n\nOur case study illustrates how Bumblebee malware from Projector Libra is seen from a\nvictim’s perspective, and it can help security professionals better understand this threat to\nprotect their organizations.\n\n\n-----\n\nWindows users can lower their risk from Bumblebee malware through spam filtering, proper\nsystem administration and ensuring their software is patched and up to date.
