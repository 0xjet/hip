We believe both\nattacks used the same infrastructure as a reported campaign by\nChinese threat actor TEMP.Periscope (also known as Leviathan),\nwhich targeted Cambodian entities in the run-up to their July 2018\nelections. Crucially, TEMP.Periscope’s interest in the U.K. engineering\ncompany they targeted dates back to attempted intrusions in May\n2017.\n\nBased on the available data and evidence outlined in this report,\nRecorded Future assesses with medium confidence that Chinese\nthreat actor TEMP.Periscope reused publicly reported, sophisticated\nTTPs from Russian threat groups Dragonfly and APT28 to target\nthe U.K. engineering company, likely to gain access to sensitive\nand proprietary technologies and data. We believe TEMP.Periscope\nreused published TTPs either to increase the group’s chances\nof success in gaining access to the victim network or to evade\nattribution by laying false flags to confuse researchers.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Timeline of selected APT28, Dragonfly, and TEMP.Periscope TTP disclosures and activity._\n\n### Key Judgments\n\n - Attackers likely used a command and control (C2) domain,\n\n[scsnewstoday[.]com, that was identified in a recent](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2018/07/chinese-espionage-group-targets-cambodia-ahead-of-elections.html)\n[TEMP.Periscope campaign targeting the](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2018/07/chinese-espionage-group-targets-cambodia-ahead-of-elections.html)\nCambodian government.\n\n - The attackers used a Chinese email client, Foxmail, to send\n\nthe spearphishing attack.\n\n - [A unique technique documented as a Dragonfly TTP in](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA18-074A)\n\ntargeting critical infrastructure was used in the attack. The\ntechnique attempts to acquire SMB credentials using a “file://”\npath in the spearphish calling out to a malicious C2.\n\n - The attack probably made use of a version of the open\n\n[source tool Responder as an NBT-NS poisoner.

Leviathan used a combination of\nunique and open source tooling to target the maritime and defense\nindustries for espionage purposes. The report detailed coverage of\nthe group dating back to at least 2014.\n\n[Reporting emerged months later highlighting further activity](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2018/03/suspected-chinese-espionage-group-targeting-maritime-and-engineering-industries.html)\nagainst the maritime and defense sectors that mainly targeted\ncompanies in the U.S. and Europe and included more details on the\ngroup’s TTPs. The activity was tagged with a new threat actor name,\nTEMP.Periscope, but the report authors noted that Leviathan and\nTEMP.Periscope were the same group.\n\nThe increased targeting of high-tech marine engineering entities\ncoincided with the growing regional tensions surrounding\nChina’s claims for much of the South China Sea (SCS) territory.\nChinese cyberespionage targeting countries neighboring the\nSouth China Sea continued to escalate in 2018, with reports of\nTEMP.Periscope [targeting Cambodia ahead of their July 2018](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2018/07/chinese-espionage-group-targets-cambodia-ahead-of-elections.html)\n[elections.

The U.K.\nengineering company shared details of the attempted spearphish\nwith Recorded Future, and the following IOCs served as a starting\npoint for our investigation.\n\n**Indicator** **Description**\n193.180.255[.]2 Spearphish sent from this IP\n82.118.242[.]243 Source of SMB credential stealing attempts\n\nNetBios server name of the device sending\nWIN-AB2I27TG6FK\nthe spearphish\n\nNetBios server name of the device conducting\nWIN-PRH492RQAFV\nSMB credential stealing\n\nEmail headers revealed that the spearphish was sent on July 6,\n2018 at 9:30 AM UTC, via Foxmail. Foxmail is a freeware email client\ndeveloped by Tencent, one of the three largest internet services\ncompanies in China. Foxmail boasts over three million daily users in\nChina and has previously been associated with [Chinese APT activity.](https://www.trendmicro.de/cloud-content/us/pdfs/security-intelligence/white-papers/wp_luckycat_redux.pdf)\n\nIn addition to email addresses belonging to the U.K. engineering\ncompany’s employees, the same spearphish was also sent to an\nemail address possibly belonging to a journalist based in Cambodia.\nThe sender account was spoofing an Australian journalist and\nlawyer, who among other things writes about Cambodian civil\nand social matters and has written for the Phnom Penh Post.\n\nIn a spearphishing campaign targeting the Cambodian elections\nin July 2018, Chinese threat actor TEMP.Periscope spoofed the\nsender address and impersonated a worker from a Cambodian\nnongovernmental organization (NGO).\n\n|Indicator|Description|\n|---|---|\n|193.180.255[.]2|Spearphish sent from this IP|\n|82.118.242[.]243|Source of SMB credential stealing attempts|\n|WIN-AB2I27TG6FK|NetBios server name of the device sending the spearphish|\n|WIN-PRH492RQAFV|NetBios server name of the device conducting SMB credential stealing|\n\n\n-----\n\n_Snippet of a spearphish email shared by the targeted U.K. engineering company._\n\nThe email contained two malicious links. The first, a “file://” link,\nif clicked, would generate an SMB session. The second link was\nto a .url file that was also configured to create an outbound SMB\nconnection.\n\nThe threat actor masqueraded as a Cambodian reporter requesting\nfurther information from the victim to be uploaded to her “report\nwebsite.” However, spelling and punctuation errors in the message\nalerted network defenders at the victim organization.\n\nOur analysis of the metadata contained within the email header\nand a subsequent controlled interaction with the file share over\nSMB revealed several interesting characteristics of the attempted\nintrusion.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Responder: The “NetBIOS Poisoner”_**\n\nFirst, we analyzed the SMB file path link. We observed the hostname\nWIN-PRH492RQAFV on C2 82.118.242[.]243 when it attempted to\nacquire SMB credentials from the victim network. We then noted\nthe hostname WIN-PRH492RQAFV was hardcoded within several\n[forked versions of a Python hacktool called Responder on GitHub.](https://github.com/mame82/P4wnP1)\nOne version of Responder with this hostname was found in a\nbuild of P4wnP1[1] that was uploaded to BeeBin, a free file upload\nservice, and another version with the same hostname was found\n[within PiBunny.](https://github.com/tholum/PiBunny)\n\n1 P4wnP1 is a highly customizable USB attack platform based on a Raspberry Pi Zero\ncomputer.\n\n_[WIN-PRH492RQAFV string present within a modified version of Responder on GitHub.](https://github.com/mame82/Responder/tree/bd2e4b5bc7b4ffcc6a7f8c239a0a945c2c822041)_\n\n\n-----\n\nResponder was released in January 2014. It is described as follows in\n[its README file listed on the official GitHub repository: “Responder](https://github.com/SpiderLabs/Responder)\nis an LLMNR, NBT-NS, and MDNS poisoner. It will answer to specific\nNBT-NS (NetBIOS Name Service) queries based on their name suffix\n[(see: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/163409). By default, the tool](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/163409)\nwill only answer to File Server Service request, which is for SMB.\nThe concept behind this is to target our answers, and be stealthier\non the network …”\n\nMalicious use of Responder was first publicly [documented on](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/08/apt28-targets-hospitality-sector.html)\nAugust 11, 2017 as being used by APT28, also known as Fancy\nBear. The tool was used against hotel visitors to spoof NetBios\nresources. Victims were coerced into connecting to UDP port 137\nand disclosing credentials over SMB to APT28, which the threat\nactor then used to gain elevated access to the network.\n\n**_More Lessons From Russia: SMB Credential Harvesting Using_**\n**_“file://” Path_**\n\nBuilding on the use of Responder, the threat actor also appeared\nto borrow techniques originating from a different Russian threat\nactor, Dragonfly, also known as Energetic Bear or Crouching Yeti.\n\nThe path “file://82.118.242[.]243/[REDACTED]” used in the spearphish\nwas likely to steal SMB credentials by creating an invisible image tag\nthat the host attempts to fetch over SMB, while giving the attackers\na hashed value of the user's NTLM password. When executing the\n[code, the browser creates an invisible image tag and sets the URL](https://www.symantec.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/leafminer-espionage-middle-east)\nto an attack server using the “file://” protocol scheme, which also\ntransmits the user’s login NTLM hash. This created an effective\nwatering hole to fingerprint potential victims and gather credentials\nfor subsequent incursions into target networks.\n\nThis technique of leveraging the “file://” path to trigger an SMB\n[connection was first publicly detailed by US-CERT on March 15, 2018](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA18-074A)\nas a sophisticated technique used by Russian government actors\nbelieved to be the Dragonfly threat actor, targeting the energy\nindustry and other critical infrastructure sectors.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_SWC Hosted On 82.118.242[.]243?_**\n\nRegistration details for 82.118.242[.]243, the IP associated with the\nSMB credential theft detailed above, proved to be inconclusive.\nWHOIS referenced the IP within a massive range registered to the\nU.K. ISP Virgin Media (82.0.0.0 - 82.47.255.255). However, MaxMind\nresolved the IP to Bulgarian hosting provider Histate Global Corp.\n\nBased on the listed vulnerabilities in Shodan and scan results for the\nmachine, 82.118.242[.]242 is a web server likely running Windows\nInternet Information Services (IIS) 7.5.

This was due to the IP appearing\n[in the IOC listing by Cisco Talos as second-stage malware associated](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/05/VPNFilter.html)\n[with the VPNFilter botnet. This botnet has been attributed to APT28](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-actions-disrupt-advanced-persistent-threat-28-botnet-infected)\n[by the U.S. Department of Justice.](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-actions-disrupt-advanced-persistent-threat-28-botnet-infected)\n\nBased on the vulnerability of the web server 82.118.242[.]243 and\nthe use of the “file://” SMB credential stealing technique directing\nthe victim to the IP, we believe the threat actor compromised the\nweb server and used it as a targeted watering hole to illicitly acquire\nSMB credentials from victims during this campaign.\n\n|CVE|Affected Software|\n|---|---|\n|CVE-2010-1256|Microsoft IIS 6.0, 7.0, and 7.5|\n|CVE-2010-1899|Microsoft IIS 5.1, 6.0, 7.0, and 7.5|\n|CVE-2010-2730|Microsoft IIS 7.5|\n|CVE-2010-3972|Microsoft FTP Service 7.0 and 7.5 for IIS 7.0 and IIS 7.5|\n|CVE-2012-2531|Microsoft IIS 7.5|\n|CVE-2012-2532|Microsoft FTP Service 7.0 and 7.5 for IIS|\n|CVE-2017-15906|OpenSSH pre-7.6|\n\n\n-----\n\n**_WIN-AB2I27TG6FK and Chinese Threat Actor TEMP.Periscope_**\n\nHostname WIN-AB2I27TG6FK was observed as the NetBios server\nname of the device sending the spearphish from the VPN IP\n193.180.255[.]2.\n\nOpen source research for the hostname WIN-AB2I27TG6FK revealed\nan open directory (Google cached link) at the URL scsnewstoday[.]\ncom/news/ that hosted several files containing the hostname in\nthe filename (see snapshot of the domain below). The domain\n[was previously reported as a C2 used by the Chinese threat actor](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2018/07/chinese-espionage-group-targets-cambodia-ahead-of-elections.html)\nTEMP.Periscope to deliver their AIRBREAK downloader. AIRBREAK,\nalso known as Orz, is a JavaScript-based backdoor that retrieves\ncommands from hidden strings in compromised webpages and\nactor-controlled profiles on legitimate services.\n\n_File listing on an open directory hosted at http://scsnewstoday[.]com/news._\n\nIn addition to AIRBREAK, the scsnewstoday C2 server [reportedly](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2018/07/chinese-espionage-group-targets-cambodia-ahead-of-elections.html)\n[hosted other malware and logs relating to TEMP.Periscope](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2018/07/chinese-espionage-group-targets-cambodia-ahead-of-elections.html)\nmalicious activity that targeted Cambodian entities in the run-up to\nthe country’s elections. The spearphish against the U.K. engineering\ncompany occurred at the same time this campaign was active —\nin early July 2018. Judging from the naming convention employed\non filenames in the open directory, C2S and S2C likely relate to\nclient-to-server and server-to-client connections with the hostname\nWIN-AB2I27TG6FK, which we assess is likely to be the hostname\nassociated with the scsnewstoday[.]com C2. We’d expect to see\nmany more files listed if the hostnames in the filenames related to\nthe clients, or victims, targeted by TEMP.Periscope.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe domain scsnewstoday[.]com was hosted on U.S. IP 68.65.123[.]230\nand registered to domain hosting service Namecheap until July 11,\n[2018. Details of the C2 domain were published just a day earlier,](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2018/07/chinese-espionage-group-targets-cambodia-ahead-of-elections.html)\nwhich we believe may have unnerved TEMP.Periscope operators,\nresulting in it being dropped. Unfortunately, the open directory is\nno longer accessible, which hampered our ability to understand the\nprecise nature of the three files containing the WIN-AB2I27TG6FK\nhostname.\n\nAccording to industry [reporting, Chinese espionage group](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2018/03/suspected-chinese-espionage-group-targeting-maritime-and-engineering-industries.html)\nTEMP.Periscope has conducted large-scale phishing, intrusion,\nremote access trojan (RAT), and data exfiltration activity since at\nleast 2013. Targeting has primarily focused on maritime-related\nentities across multiple industries, including engineering, shipping\nand transportation, manufacturing, defense, government offices,\nand research universities. However, the group has also targeted\nprofessional and consulting services, high-tech industry, healthcare,\nand media and publishing.\n\n**_Originating IP for Spearphish 193.180.255[.]2_**\n\nThis IP appeared in the email header information as the X-ForwardedFor IP, indicating that it was the originating IP address for the\nsender of the spearphish. WHOIS registration data revealed that\n193.180.255[.]2 is registered to Privat Kommunikation Sverige AB,\n[which is the full company name of PrivateVPN, a popular commercial](https://privatevpn.com/)\nVPN service. The company states that they support OpenVPN over\nTCP/UDP, L2TP, IPSEC, PPTP, and IKEv2 protocols.\n\nRecorded Future identified three VPN connections involving the\n193.180.255[.]2 IP between June 30 and July 1, 2018. All three\nconnections were over UDP 500 (IKE/IKEv2), originating from\nBangladesh IP 103.198.138[.]187.\n\nAdditionally, between July 3 and July 10, 2018, 193.180.255[.]2\nestablished SSH (TCP 22), NetBios (TCP 139), and Microsoft SMB\n(TCP 445) connections to the malicious SMB credential harvesting\nC2 82.118.242[.]243. Interestingly, these connections took place\nduring the seven-day window within which the spearphish was sent.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Historic Targeting of U.K. Engineering Company by_**\n**_TEMP.Periscope_**\n\nPrior to this attempt in July, the same U.K. engineering company\nhad previously been targeted in May 2017. This campaign used the\nETERNALBLUE exploit and a unique DNS tunneler backdoor. The DNS\ntunneler used in the attack was configured to communicate with a\nsubdomain of thyssenkrupp-marinesystems[.]org. The domain was\nclearly spoofing German defense contractor ThyssenKrupp Marine\nSystems, which specializes in marine engineering. In addition to\nhosting the spoofed domain, Netherlands-based HostSailor VPS\nIP 185.106.120[.]206 also hosted an open directory containing\nmalware and tools for use by the threat actor, not dissimilar to the\nTEMP.Periscope scsnewstoday[.]com C2 and open directory set up.\n\nRecorded Future analysis on the spoofed domain revealed\nthat this server hosted the SeDll Javascript loader SHA256:\n146aa9a0ec013aa5bdba9ea9d29f59d48d43bc17c6a20b7\n4bb8c521dbb5bc6f4, which [had been used in August 2017 by](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/leviathan-espionage-actor-spearphishes-maritime-and-defense-targets)\nLeviathan (also known as TEMP.Periscope) to execute another\nJavascript backdoor, AIRBREAK. Crucially, the first mention of\nLeviathan as a Chinese threat actor occurred in October 2017,\nmeaning TEMP.Periscope was using the same infrastructure to\ntarget the U.K. engineering company six months earlier.\n\nIn November 2017, another spearphish leveraging Microsoft\nEquation Editor vulnerability CVE-2017-11882 was sent to the U.K.\nengineering company. This attack delivered a Cobalt Strike payload.\n\n### Conclusions and Outlook\n\nThe attempted spearphish has revealed a suite of TTPs that are\nlinked to the recent activities of several different threat actors:\nAPT28, Dragonfly, and TEMP.Periscope. We have listed the key TTPs\nobserved in this attack in a chronological format in order to draw\nattention to the likelihood of techniques being copied from publicly\ndisclosed reporting of these TTPs. These are summarized in the\ntable below:\n\n\n-----\n\n|Observed TTP|TTP Category|Similarity With Historic APT TTPs|Date TTP Publicized|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Use of Chinese email client Foxmail|Infrastructure|Previously reported as being a client used by Chinese APT group Luckycat.|2012|\n|Use of open source tool Responder (albeit a modified instance in this case, based on the presence of the hardcoded hostname, WIN-PRH492RQAFV|Malware/ Tooling|APT28 deployed Responder on a hospitality sector network they compromised using ETERNALBLUE.

A Russian threat actor was responsible and borrowed\n\nTEMP.Periscope TTPs.\n\n2. TEMP.Periscope was responsible and borrowed Russian\n\nthreat actor TTPs.\n\n3. Another threat actor was responsible that used TTPs from the\n\nRussian groups and TEMP.Periscope.\n\nIn order to assess which of the three hypotheses above best explains\nour observations, we assessed the accumulated evidence detailed\nin this report.\n\nFirst, we are certain that the attacker used IP 193.180.255[.]2 as\na VPN endpoint to send the spearphish because the IP address\nresolves to Swedish VPN service PrivateVPN. We are also certain that\nthe device that sent the spearphish was associated with the WINAB2I27TG6FK hostname. Further, we can state that this hostname\nwas used in the filename of several files hosted on a known\nTEMP.Periscope C2, which had an open directory. As outlined\nearlier in this report, we believe the sender of the spearphish, WINAB2I27TG6FK, is probably the hostname of the TEMP.Periscope\nopen directory hosted at scsnewstoday[.]com.\n\nThe spearphish was sent on July 6, 2018. Just a few days later,\nFireEye reported on a TEMP.Periscope campaign targeting the\nCambodian elections in July 2018 that used the open directory\nhosted on scsnewstoday[.]com as a C2. The report noted that the\nsame infrastructure was likely active since at least April 2017.\n\nSecondly, the “file://” path included in the spearphish linking to the\nC2 82.118.242[.]243 was designed to steal credentials over SMB.\nThis technique was documented publicly as a Dragonfly threat actor\n[TTP by the US-CERT in March 2018, almost four months before the](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA18-074A)\nobserved attack.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe observed hostname on the 82.118.242[.]243 IP was WINPRH492RQAFV, which we found was hard coded in a forked\nResponder script on GitHub. The original Responder script has\npreviously been used by another Russian threat actor, APT28,\n[according to reporting published in August 2017.](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/08/apt28-targets-hospitality-sector.html)\n\n_Timeline of selected APT28, Dragonfly, and TEMP.Periscope TTP disclosures and activity._\n\nTEMP.Periscope has been actively followed by the research\ncommunity since at least October 2017 — two months after APT28’s\n[use of Responder was disclosed by FireEye in August 2017.[2] There](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/08/apt28-targets-hospitality-sector.html)\n[has since been a flurry of reporting on TEMP.Periscope activity in](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2018/07/chinese-espionage-group-targets-cambodia-ahead-of-elections.html)\n2018, with campaigns against American and European maritime\nengineering companies and the Cambodian government. We\nshould note here that the spearphish we observed was also sent\nto an email account that contained the name of a journalist based\nin Cambodia and was sent from an account spoofing an Australian\njournalist that had previously reported on Cambodian topics.\n\n[2 F-Secure published research in August 2016 on their investigations into the NanHaiShu](https://www.f-secure.com/documents/996508/1030745/nanhaishu_whitepaper.pdf)\nRAT, which has since been attributed to TEMP.Periscope (Leviathan).\n\n\n-----\n\nTherefore, it is plausible that, with the timeline of Russian tooling\nbeing made public prior to the disclosure of the TEMP.Periscope\ncampaigns, TEMP.Periscope adapted their TTPs to either hinder\nattribution efforts or to simply use techniques that they deemed\nwould be effective.\n\nThe overlap in infrastructure with the scsnewstoday[.]com C2\ndomain is also key; the domain was publicly reported by FireEye as\nbeing used by TEMP.Periscope only a few days after the spearphish\nto the U.K. engineering company was sent, making it highly\nunlikely that another threat actor could have compromised the\nC2. Additionally, the longer-term targeting of the U.K. engineering\ncompany by TEMP.Periscope since at least May 2017 highlights the\ngroup’s persistence in attempting to gain access.\n\nBased on the available data and evidence outlined in this report,\nRecorded Future assesses with medium confidence that Chinese\nthreat actor TEMP.Periscope reused TTPs from other threat groups\nto target the U.K. engineering company, likely to gain access to their\nsensitive and proprietary technologies and data. TEMP.Periscope\nhas demonstrated an ability to rapidly adapt its TTPs to learn from\nother groups, such as APT28 and Dragonfly, either to increase their\nchances of success in gaining access to the victim network or to\nobfuscate attribution attempts.\n\nRecorded Future expects TEMP.Periscope to continue to target\norganizations in the high-tech defense and engineering sectors. The\nChinese strategic requirement to develop advanced technology,\nparticularly in marine engineering, remains an intense focus as\nChina looks to dominate the South China Sea territory. We believe\nTEMP.Periscope will continue to use commodity malware because\nit is still broadly successful and relatively low cost for them to use.\nThey will continue to observe “trending” vulnerabilities to exploit\nand use techniques that have been publicly reported in order to\ngain access to victim networks.\n\n\n-----\n\nFinally, Recorded Future believes that threat actors are actively\nemulating each other, monitoring publications and data sources\nboth to protect their infrastructure and to observe techniques that\nrival actors are using. We anticipate that adversaries will continue\nto plant false flags, either via technical means (as observed in the\n[Olympic Destroyer campaign) or with technique emulation. As means](https://www.recordedfuture.com/olympic-destroyer-malware/)\nof detection have drastically improved, the public identification of\ncode overlap and the mapping of TTPs plays into the hands of wellcoordinated operations, which can now make attribution findings\nmurky at best. The samples and techniques named in a report can\nnow rapidly be transposed into new or ongoing campaigns due to\nthe volume of public reporting on these issues. This muddying of\nthe waters allows targeted campaigns to better blend in with the\nnoise, attempting to blur the lines between adversary groups.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Network Defense Recommendations\n\nRecorded Future recommends organizations conduct the following\nmeasures when defending against TEMP.Periscope’s attempts to\nsteal credentials to gain network access:\n\n - Configure your intrusion detection systems (IDS), intrusion\n\nprevention systems (IPS), or any network defense mechanisms\nin place to alert on — and upon review, consider blocking\nillicit connection attempts from — the external IP addresses\nand domains listed in Appendix A.\n\n - Include the provided Snort rules in Appendix B in IDS and IPS\n\nappliances to detect attempted SMB credential stealing. Also,\nif applicable, use the provided Bro queries in Appendix B to\nhunt for signs of TEMP.Periscope TTPs detailed in this report\non your network.\n\n - Use Recorded Future’s API to import indicators listed in\n\nthis report (Appendix A) into your endpoint detection and\nresponse (EDR) platform.\n\n - Configure endpoint detection and response traffic to alert and\n\nblock connections to indicators in Appendix A.\n\n - Utilize the provided Yara rule in Appendix C to search your\n\nnetwork for evidence of the spearphish being sent to your\norganization.\n\n - Monitor and restrict SMB traffic across your network,\n\nparticularly external attempts to authenticate via SMB.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Appendix A — Indicators of Compromise\n\n\nIPv4\n82.118.242[.]243\n193.180.255[.]2\n185.106.120[.]206\n68.65.123[.]230\n\nDomains\nthyssenkrupp-marinesystems[.]org\nscsnewstoday[.]com\n\nSHA256\n146aa9a0ec013aa5bdba9ea9d29f59d48d43bc17c6a20b74bb8c521dbb5bc6f4\n\n\n### Appendix B — Network Monitoring\n\n```\nSnort Rules to Detect SMB Credential Snarf (via US-CERT)\nalert tcp any any -> any 445 (msg:\"SMB Client Request contains 'AME_ICON.\n\n```\nPNG' (SMB credential harvesting)\"; sid:42000003; rev:1; flow:established,to_\n```\nserver; content:\"|FF|SMB|75 00 00 00 00|\"; offset:4; depth:9; content:\"|08\n\n```\n00 01 00|\"; distance:3; content:\"|00 5c 5c|\"; distance:2; within:3; con­\ntent:\"|5c|AME_ICON.PNG\"; distance:7; fast_pattern; classtype:bad-unknown;\nmetadata:service netbios-ssn;)\n```\n________________________________________\n\n```\n```\nalert tcp $HOME_NET any -> $EXTERNAL_NET $HTTP_PORTS (msg:\"HTTP URI OPTIONS\ncontains '/ame_icon.png' (SMB credential harvesting)\"; sid:42000004; rev:1;\n\n```\nflow:established,to_server; content:\"/ame_icon.png\"; http_uri; fast_pat­\ntern:only; content:\"OPTIONS\"; nocase; http_method; classtype:bad-unknown;\n```\nmetadata:service http;)\n__________________________________________\n\n```\n\nalert tcp $EXTERNAL_NET [139,445] -> $HOME_NET any (msg:\"SMB Server Traffic\ncontains NTLM-Authenticated SMBv1 Session\"; sid:42000006; rev:1; flow:estab­\nlished,to_client; content:\"|ff 53 4d 42 72 00 00 00 00 80|\"; fast_pat­\ntern:only; content:\"|05 00|\"; distance:23; classtype:bad-unknown; meta­\ndata:service netbios-ssn;)\n\n\n-----\n\nRecorded Future customers and community members familiar with\nBro IDS can utilize its features to threat hunt for TEMP.Periscope\nactivity pertaining to the intrusion documented in this research:\n\n|Example Bro Command|Pertinent Indicator(s)|Description|\n|---|---|---|\n|cat dns.log | bro-cut query | grep -iE “thyssenkrupp\\-marinesystems\\.org”|thyssenkrupp-marinesystems[.]org scsnewstoday[.]com|Search DNS queries for calls made from hosts on your network to TEMP.Periscope malicious C2s|\n|cat dns.log | bro-cut -d answers | grep -E “82\\.118\\.242\\.243”|82.118.242[.]243 193.180.255[.]2 185.106.120[.]206 68.65.123[.]230|Search DNS responses for calls made from hosts on your network to TEMP.Periscope malicious infrastructure|\n|cat conn.log |grep -E “82\\.118\\.242\\.243”|82.118.242[.]243 193.180.255[.]2 185.106.120[.]206 68.65.123[.]230|Search Bro connections log for evidence of connections to TEMP.Periscope malicious infrastructure|\n|cat dce_rpc.log |grep “WIN- PRH492RQAFV“ cat ntlm.log |grep “WIN-PRH492RQAFV“ cat smb_cmd.log |grep “WIN- PRH492RQAFV“ cat smb_files |grep “WIN- PRH492RQAFV“ cat smb_mapping.log |grep “WIN- PRH492RQAFV“|WIN-PRH492RQAFV|Search Bro SMB logs for evidence of use of specific modified version of Responder used in this campaign|\n\n\n-----\n\n### Appendix C — Yara Rules\n\n```\n/*\nYARA rule to detect spearphish email (.eml) sent by Chinese threat actor\n\nTEMP.Periscope in July 2018.\n*/\nrule TEMP_Periscope_July2018_Spearphish : email\n{\n meta:\n     Author = \"Insikt Group, Recorded Future\"\n     TLP = \"White\"\n     Date = \"2018-09-22\"\n     Description =\"Rule to identify spearphish sent by Chinese threat actor\nTEMP.Periscope during July 2018 campaign”\n strings:\n     $eml_1=\"From:\"\n     $eml_2=\"To:\"\n     $eml_3=\"Subject:\"\n  $greeting_1=\"Dear,\"\n     $content_1=\"Melissa Coade\" nocase\n     $content_2=\"Below is the Report Website and conatc\"\n     $content_3=\"Would yo mind giving me\"\n\n```\n$url_1=\"file://\"\n```\n     $url_2=\"https://drive.google.com/open?\"\n condition:\n     all of ($eml*) and\n     all of ($greeting*) and\n     2 of ($content*) and\n     2 of ($url*)\n}\n\n```\n\n**About Recorded Future**\n\nRecorded Future arms security teams with the only complete threat intelligence\n\nsolution powered by patented machine learning to lower risk.
