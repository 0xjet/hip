We saw the first infections](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/portal/mmpc/shared/ransomware.aspx)\nin Ukraine, where more than 12,500 machines encountered the threat. We then observed infections in another 64\ncountries, including Belgium, Brazil, Germany, Russia, and the United States.\n\n_The trend towards increasingly sophisticated malware behavior, highlighted by the use of exploits and other_\n_attack vectors, makes older platforms so much more susceptible to ransomware attacks. From June to_\n_November 2017, Windows 7 devices were 3.4 times more likely to encounter ransomware compared to_\n_Windows 10 devices._\n\n_Read our latest report: A worthy upgrade: Next-gen security on Windows 10 proves resilient against_\n**_ransomware outbreaks in 2017_**\n\n_(Note: We have published a follow-up blog entry on this ransomware attack. We have new findings from our_\n_continued investigation, as well as platform mitigation and protection information: Windows 10 platform resilience_\n_against the Petya ransomware attack.)_\n\nThe new ransomware has worm capabilities, which allows it to move laterally across infected networks. Based on\n[our investigation, this new ransomware shares similar codes and is a new variant of Ransom:Win32/Petya. This](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/portal/threat/encyclopedia/Entry.aspx?Name=Ransom:Win32/Petya)\nnew strain of ransomware, however, is more sophisticated.\n\nTo protect our customers, we released cloud-delivered protection updates and made updates to our signature\ndefinition packages shortly after. These updates were automatically delivered to all Microsoft free antimalware\n[products, including Windows Defender Antivirus and Microsoft Security Essentials. You can download the latest](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/itpro/windows/keep-secure/windows-defender-in-windows-10)\n[version of these files manually at the Malware Protection Center.](https://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/definitions/adl.aspx)\n\n[Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Windows Defender ATP) automatically detects behaviors used](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windowsforbusiness/windows-atp?ocid=cx-blog-mmpc)\nby this new ransomware variant without any updates. To test how Windows Defender ATP can help your\n[organization detect, investigate, and respond to advanced attacks, sign up for a free trial.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windowsforbusiness/windows-atp?ocid=cx-blog-mmpc)\n\n## Delivery and installation\n\nInitial infection appears to involve a software supply-chain threat involving the Ukrainian company M.E.Doc,\nwhich develops tax accounting software, MEDoc. Although this vector was speculated at length by news media\nand security researchers—including Ukraine’s own Cyber Police—there was only circumstantial evidence for this\nvector. Microsoft now has evidence that a few active infections of the ransomware initially started from the\nlegitimate MEDoc updater process. As we highlighted previously, [software supply chain attacks are a recent](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/mmpc/2017/05/04/windows-defender-atp-thwarts-operation-wilysupply-software-supply-chain-cyberattack/)\ndangerous trend with attackers, and it requires advanced defense.\n\nWe observed telemetry showing the MEDoc software updater process (EzVit.exe) executing a malicious\ncommand-line matching this exact attack pattern on Tuesday, June 27 around 10:30 a.m. GMT.\n\nThe execution chain leading to the ransomware installation is represented in the diagram below and essentially\nconfirms that EzVit.exe process from MEDoc, for unknown reasons, at some moment executed the following\ncommand-line:\n\n_C:\\\\Windows\\\\system32\\\\rundll32.exe\\” \\”C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\perfc.dat\\”,#1 30_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe same update vector was also mentioned by the Ukraine Cyber Police in a public list of indicators of\ncompromise (IOCs), which includes the MEDoc updater.\n\n## A single ransomware, multiple lateral movement techniques\n\nGiven this new ransomware’s added lateral movement capabilities it only takes a single infected machine to\naffect a network. The ransomware spreading functionality is composed of multiple methods responsible for:\n\nstealing credentials or re-using existing active sessions\nusing file-shares to transfer the malicious file across machines on the same network\nusing existing legitimate functionalities to execute the payload or abusing SMB vulnerabilities for unpatched\nmachines\n\nIn the next sections, we discuss the details of each technique.\n\n## Lateral movement using credential theft and impersonation\n\nThis ransomware drops a credential dumping tool (typically as a .tmp file in the %Temp% folder) that shares code\n[similarities with Mimikatz and comes in 32-bit and 64-bit variants. Because users frequently log in using accounts](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/portal/threat/encyclopedia/Entry.aspx?Name=HackTool:Win32/Mimikatz)\nwith local admin privileges and have active sessions opens across multiple machines, stolen credentials are\nlikely to provide the same level of access the user has on other machines.\n\nOnce the ransomware has valid credentials, it scans the local network to establish valid connections on ports\n_tcp/139 and tcp/445. A special behavior is reserved for Domain Controllers or servers: this ransomware attempts_\nto call DhcpEnumSubnets() to enumerate DHCP subnets; for each subnet, it gathers all hosts/clients (using\n_DhcpEnumSubnetClients()) for scanning for tcp/139 and tcp/445 services. If it gets a response, the malware_\nattempts to copy a binary on the remote machine using regular file-transfer functionalities with the stolen\ncredentials.\n\nIt then tries to execute remotely the malware using either PSEXEC or WMIC tools.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe ransomware attempts to drop the legitimate psexec.exe (typically renamed to dllhost.dat) from an embedded\nresource within the malware. It then scans the local network for admin$ shares, copies itself across the network,\nand executes the newly copied malware binary remotely using PSEXEC.\n\nIn addition to credential dumping, the malware also tries to steal credentials by using the CredEnumerateW\nfunction to get all the other user credentials potentially stored on the credential store. If a credential name starts\nwith “TERMSRV/” and the type is set as 1 (generic) it uses that credential to propagate through the network.\n\n_Ransomware code responsible for accessing \\\\Admin$ shares on different machines_\n\nThis ransomware also uses the Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line (WMIC) to find remote\nshares (using NetEnum/NetAdd) to spread to. It uses either a duplicate token of the current user (for existing\nconnections), or a username/password combination (spreading through legit tools).\n\n_Screenshot showing launch of malware on a remote machine using WMIC_\n\n\n-----\n\n## Lateral movement using EternalBlue and EternalRomance\n\nThe new ransomware can also spread using an exploit for the Server Message Block (SMB) vulnerability CVE[2017-0144 (also known as EternalBlue), which was fixed in security update MS17-010 and was also exploited by](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/ms17-010.aspx)\n[WannaCrypt to spread to out-of-date machines. In addition, this ransomware also uses a second exploit for CVE-](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/mmpc/2017/05/12/wannacrypt-ransomware-worm-targets-out-of-date-systems/)\n2017-0145 (also known as EternalRomance, and fixed by the same bulletin).\n\nWe’ve seen this ransomware attempt to use these exploits by generating SMBv1 packets (which are all XOR\n_0xCC encrypted) to trigger these vulnerabilities at the following address of the malware code:_\n\n[These two exploits were leaked by a group called Shadow Brokers. However, it is important to note that both of](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/mmpc/2017/06/16/analysis-of-the-shadow-brokers-release-and-mitigation-with-windows-10-virtualization-based-security/)\n[these vulnerabilities have been fixed by Microsoft in security update MS17-010 on March 14, 2017.](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/ms17-010.aspx)\n\n[Machines that are patched against these exploits (with security update MS17-010) or](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/ms17-010.aspx) [have disabled SMBv1 are](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2696547)\n[not affected by this particular spreading mechanism. Please refer to our previous blog for details on these](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/mmpc/2017/06/16/analysis-of-the-shadow-brokers-release-and-mitigation-with-windows-10-virtualization-based-security/)\nexploits and how modern Windows 10 mitigations can help to contain similar threats.\n\n## Encryption\n\nThis ransomware’s encryption behavior depends on the malware process privilege level and the processes found\nto be running on the machine. It does this by employing a simple XOR-based hashing algorithm on the process\nnames, and checks against the following hash values to use as a behavior exclusion:\n\n\n-----\n\n_0x6403527E or 0x651B3005 – if these hashes of process names are found running on the machine, then_\nthe ransomware does not do SMB exploitation.\n\n_0x2E214B44 – if a process with this hashed name is found, the ransomware trashes the first 10 sectors of_\n_\\\\\\\\.\\\\PhysicalDrive0, including the MBR_\n\n\n-----\n\nThis ransomware then writes to the master boot record (MBR) and then sets up the system to reboot. It sets up\nscheduled tasks to shut down the machine after at least 10 minutes past the current time. The exact time is\nrandom (GetTickCount()). For example:\n\n_schtasks /Create /SC once /TN “” /TR “<system folder>\\shutdown.exe /r /f” /ST 14:23_\n\nAfter successfully modifying the MBR, it displays the following fake system message, which notes a supposed\nerror in the drive and shows the fake integrity checking:\n\nIt then displays this ransom note:\n\n\n-----\n\nOnly if the malware is running with highest privilege (i.e., with SeDebugPrivilege enabled), it tries to overwrite the\nMBR code.\n\nThis ransomware attempts to encrypt all files with the following file name extensions in all folders in all fixed\ndrives, except for C:\\Windows:\n\n.3ds .7z .accdb .ai\n\n.asp .aspx .avhd .back\n\n.bak .c .cfg .conf\n\n.cpp .cs .ctl .dbf\n\n.disk .djvu .doc .docx\n\n.dwg .eml .fdb .gz\n\n.h .hdd .kdbx .mail\n\n.mdb .msg .nrg .ora\n\n.ost .ova .ovf .pdf\n\n.php .pmf .ppt .pptx\n\n.pst .pvi .py .pyc\n\n.rar .rtf .sln .sql\n\n.tar .vbox .vbs .vcb\n\n.vdi .vfd .vmc .vmdk\n\n.vmsd .vmx .vsdx .vsv\n\n.work .xls .xlsx .xvd\n\n.zip\n\nIt uses file mapping APIs instead of a usual ReadFile()/WriteFile() APIs:\n\nUnlike most other ransomware, this threat does not append a new file name extension to encrypted files. Instead,\nit overwrites the said files.\n\nThe AES key generated for encryption is per machine, per fixed drive, and gets exported and encrypted using the\nembedded 2048-bit RSA public key of the attacker.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Embedded RSA public key_\n\n_Code exporting the AES 128 bit key per machine, per fixed drive in the machine and encrypting it using_\n_embedded RSA public key during export_\n\nThe unique key used for files encryption (AES) is added, in encrypted form, to the README.TXT file the threat\nwrites under section “Your personal installation key:”.\n\nBeyond encrypting files, this ransomware also attempts to infect the MBR or destroy certain sectors of VBR and\nMBR:\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter completing its encryption routine, this ransomware drops a text file called README.TXT in each fixed drive.\nThe said file has the following text:\n\nThis ransomware also clears the System, Setup, Security, Application event logs and deletes NTFS journal info.\n\n## Detection and investigation with Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection\n\n[Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Windows Defender ATP) is a post-breach solution and offers](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windowsforbusiness/windows-atp?ocid=cx-blog-mmpc)\nby-design detections for this attack without need of any signature updates. Windows Defender ATP sensors\nconstantly monitor and collect telemetry from the endpoints and offers machine-learning detections for common\nlateral movement techniques and tools used by this ransomware, including, for example, the execution of\n_PsExec.exe with different filename, and the creation of the perfc.dat file in remote shares (UNC) paths._\n\nToday, without the need of additional updates, an infected machine may look like this:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe second alert targets the distribution of the ransomware’s .dll file over the network. This event provides helpful\ninformation during investigation as it includes the User context that was used to move the file remotely. This user\nhas been compromised and could represent the user associated with patient-zero:\n\nWith Windows Defender ATP, enterprise customers are well-equipped to quickly identify Petya outbreaks,\ninvestigate the scope of the attack, and respond early to malware delivery campaigns.\n\n## Protection against this new ransomware attack\n\n[Keeping your Windows 10](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-10-upgrade) [up-to-date gives you the benefits of the latest features and proactive mitigations built](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/311047/how-to-keep-your-windows-computer-up-to-date)\ninto the latest versions of Windows.
