The](http://www.motherjones.com/media/2007/10/great-partition-making-india-and-pakistan)**\n\n**“hastily drawn” border by the departing British, which separated Pakistan from the mostly**\n\n**Hindu India, never fully resolved all the issues.**\n\n**Several wars between the two nations ensued and tensions continue to this day. A floodlit,�**\n\n**1250-mile portion of the current international border (a.k.a. the Line of Control) is visible in a**\n\n**[photo taken from the International Space Station.](http://qz.com/516864/the-india-pakistan-border-is-so-closely-guarded-that-it-can-be-seen-from-space/)**\n\n**Indian soldiers (in present day Bangladesh) during the third war between India and Pakistan in December**\n\n**1971.**\n\n**The continuing rivalry between India and Pakistan has spilled over into cyberspace, very**\n\n**visibly with hacktivism. This post reviews that activity and demonstrates how high-profile�**\n\n**events and anniversaries (e.g., Indian Independence Day on August 15, Pakistan’s**\n\n**[Independence Day on August 14, the Mumbai attacks on November 26, and even cricket](http://www.ndtv.com/topic/mumbai-attacks)**\n\n**matches between the two countries) often coincide with increased cyber activity.**\n\n### The Cyber Dimension to India and Pakistan’s Cricket Rivalry\n\n\n-----\n\n**An India versus Pakistan cricket match, in March 14, results in an Indian university website being hacked.**\n\n**The game of cricket provides a perfect field for a great rivalry between India and Pakistan.�**\n\n**Wins and losses have geopolitical, social, and cyber repercussions on both sides.**\n\n**Conversely, geopolitical and social tensions have led to matches being postponed or**\n\n**cancelled.**\n\n**On March 2, 2014, Pakistan defeated India in a cricket match in the Asia Cup held in Dhaka,**\n\n**Bangladesh. The next day (March 3), in Meerut, India, 67 Kashmiri students at Swami**\n\n**Vivekanand Subharti University were suspended for having cheered for Pakistan and**\n\n**distributing sweets after their win.**\n\n**Then on March 5, 2014, the website of Swami Vivekanand Subharti University was hacked**\n\n**by a group claiming to be the Pakistan Cyber Army (a.k.a. Bangladesh Cyber Army) in**\n\n**response to expelling pro-Pakistan students.**\n\n**Finally, on March 7, 2014 the sedition charges against expelled students are dropped but**\n\n**they could still face prosecution over the incident.**\n\n**Based on this past event, it’s likely that cyber activity will take place between Indian and**\n\n**Pakistani actors before, during, and after the next cricket match between India and Pakistan**\n\n**[on March 19 in Dharamsala, India.](http://www.espncricinfo.com/icc-world-twenty20-2016/content/story/951215.html)**\n\n### A Predictable Pattern on Independence Days\n\n\n-----\n\n**respectively, create a predictable pattern (at least over the past three years) of attacks and**\n\n**retaliatory strikes by the opposing hacker groups, as shown in the timeline below. An uptick**\n\n**in such activity before and after this year’s independence days shouldn’t come as a surprise.**\n\n### Pakistan Cyber Army Targeting India: A Snapshot 2007 Onward\n\n**Let’s take a closer look at the activities of the Pakistan Cyber Army (PCA), which was**\n\n**involved in the cricket incident described earlier.**\n\n**The timeline below shows that the PCA has been consistently active at least since the 2007**\n\n**hacking, defacing and shutting down high-profile Indian websites. Government and private�**\n\n**sites have been targeted including Indian Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (a Fortune 500**\n\n**company), Indian Railways, the Central Bureau of Investigation, Central Bank of India, and**\n\n**the State Government of Kerala.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**The PCA’s “public announcement” of its operations against India and the PCA’s motives are**\n\n**described in a document on Pastebin as shown in the image below, conveniently cached in**\n\n**Recorded Future. This particular message is related to PCA’s attacks to commemorate**\n\n**Pakistan’s independence day (August 14).**\n\n\n-----\n\n**When we investigate the PCA’s TTPs (tactics, techniques, and procedures) to learn how**\n\n**they operate, we find examples like tutorials on how to set up phishing attacks as shown in�**\n\n**this Facebook post. Though of course it’s hard to establish, this is indeed a PCA actor who**\n\n**posted this:**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Below is another example where SQL injection attacks are allegedly used by Pakistani**\n\n**hackers to compromise Indian websites.**\n\n**[In their research into PCA’s activities, ThreatConnect and FireEye also reported finding�](https://www.threatconnect.com/debugging-pca-from-pakbugs-to-bitterbugs/)**\n\n**possible links to personas with skills in exploiting Web applications and services, identifying**\n\n**zero-day vulnerabilities, SQL injection, WEP cracking, and spear phishing.**\n\n**In some instances the hackers chose to identify themselves — for example, the hacker**\n\n**behind India’s Kerala state website defacement in September 2015 identified himself as�**\n\n**“Faisal 1337” as shown in the image below.**\n\n**If we widen our view again and look at hackers from Pakistan and India targeting each other**\n\n**over the last seven months, we can see an interesting retaliatory pattern of attacks; the**\n\n**[latest major response being Indian hackers avenging the deadly January 2, 2016 attack on](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Pathankot-terror-attack-Jihadis-made-dry-runs-at-Pakistani-air-base-intelligence-sources-say/articleshow/50461180.cms)**\n\n**h** **I di** **Ai F** **b** **i** **P** **h** **k**\n\n\n-----\n\n**There are a number of hacker groups in India including the Indian Black Hats who reportedly**\n\n**claimed responsibility for the January 7 (timeline image above) revenge for the attack on**\n\n**Pathankot, and the Mallu Cyber Soldiers who were said to avenge the attacks on the Kerala**\n\n**state government website.**\n\n**When looking at hacking methods used by these groups, given that they go after weakly**\n\n**secured websites or those with unpatched vulnerabilities, one can expect to find generally�**\n\n**applicable instructions and techniques used and shared by various groups, especially when**\n\n**they self-identify themselves under the broad umbrella of “India hackers.” The methods used**\n\n**by these groups include SQL injection and PHP Web application hacks as shown by the**\n\n**mentions below.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**The Pastebin references mentions a tool “D3LT4” to scan websites for SQL injection vulnerabilities, and**\n\n**further references to PHP scripts which can be used to hack Web applications.**\n\n### Conclusion\n\n**The glimpses above hint at the many possible motivations and objectives of the cyber**\n\n**activities between India and Pakistan.**\n\n**These could range all the way from loosely affiliated hacktivist groups avenging attacks by�**\n\n**defacing symbols and institutions to more coordinated state-sponsored attacks, which will be**\n\n**covered in a future piece. The Line of Control (a.k.a. international border) between the two**\n\n**only serves as a symbol of adversarial tension and certainly not a barrier in the cyber realm.**\n\n### Related Articles\n\n\n-----\n\n**Analyzing the Patch Timeline for Zero-Day**\n**Exploits**\n\n\n**POS Malware Overview for the 2014 Holiday**\n**Shopping Season**\n\n\n**[The Russia-Ukraine Cyber Front Takes Shape](https://www.recordedfuture.com/russia-ukraine-cyber-front/)** **Mazar Android Bot: Threat or Not?
