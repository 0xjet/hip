But this is far from the complete picture\nof what threats organizations face. One of the most, if not the most, costly is something far\nless sophisticated: Business Email Compromise (BEC). BEC can take a wide array of\ndifferent forms, but its goal is relatively simple — trick an unsuspecting user into giving them\nsomething. Lately, we've seen a recent rise in these types of attacks, with adversaries still\nusing COVID-19 as a major topic of lures to draw unsuspecting victims into turning over\nimportant personal and financial information.\n\nLooking at conservative estimates, business email compromise losses are in the billions,\n[with the FBI stating in 2020 alone the loses approached $1.8 Billion. This is an extremely](https://www.ic3.gov/Media/PDF/AnnualReport/2020_IC3Report.pdf)\nlucrative enterprise with a low barrier to entry. Other forms of cybercrime are tougher to enter\nbecause the actor needs to source the malware they are going to distribute and have enough\nknowledge to set up and run the associated infrastructure — or at the very least, pay\nsomeone who does. At the very least, this takes a significant amount of time and effort,\nwhere BEC removes the majority of those barriers.\n\n\n-----\n\nBusiness Email Compromise starts as a lot of cybercrime does, with an email. These emails\ncan vary widely in content or in design, but they are almost always spoofed to look like they\nare coming from someone important. The other common thing is they will almost always ask\nfor some type of assistance. The type of request varies widely, as we'll demonstrate\nthroughout this blog, but the resulting ask is always financial in nature and will require the\nrecipient to purchase something or wire funds somewhere. So let's walk through some\nexamples of what we've seen over the past year.\n\n### Gift card requests\n\nThe overwhelming majority of the BEC emails we've encountered over the last year revolve\naround some sort of gift card purchase. The opening lines to these emails are typically\nsomething like, \"I need you help with a quick task,\" or \"Do you have an amazon account ?\"\nThese requests are also likely tied to some extraordinary event. Much of the time, it's a\nsurprise for employees or tied to some specific event, as the example below shows.\n\nThis is by far one of the most common ways we see BEC. These emails typically come from\na free email service (i.e. Gmail, Yahoo, or Outlook) but spoofed to appear to be someone\nimportant in the organization. The supposed position of the person within an organization\nand the amount of detail can vary widely depending on the sophistication level of the\nattacker. In this case, it's a relatively innocuous request to get a PlayStation gift card for an\nexecutive's nephew. Also, it's commonly tied to something that will encourage you to have\nsympathy for the challenges they are facing. In this case, it's due to a funeral for a close\nfriend of the alleged executive. The reasons for this are twofold: First, it creates some\nsympathy from the victim to hopefully encourage them to help out. It also creates a narrative\nwhere pushing back or questioning the request appears insensitive because of the sender's\ncurrent circumstances. This type of tactic is incredibly common and can get pretty\ndespicable, as we'll demonstrate later.\n\nThe types of gift cards these actors request fall into a few different categories. The most\ncommon are iTunes or Google Play gift cards. This is a logical choice for adversaries, since\nthere is a huge market for these types of gift cards, as most people have smartphones today,\nand monetization can occur quickly. Actors have a wide array of ways to re-sell these gift\ncards on legitimate and illegitimate marketplaces.\n\n\n-----\n\nHowever, we have seen a few other types of cards, one of which can be found in the\nexample above — PlayStation gift cards. Those, along with Amazon gift cards, make up the\noverwhelming majority of the requests we've seen over the past year, but should not be\nconsidered an exhaustive list.\n\nThe emails themselves are usually constructed in a very simple manner, with subjects\nrequesting help. Common examples include things like \"Task,\" \"Quick Favor\" and \"Hi,\"\namong many others. The subject and content are typically kept short and to the point, even\nincluding indicators the email was sent from a mobile device like a tablet or smartphone. This\nis done purposefully, as most individuals asking for this type of help aren't going to write\nseveral paragraphs explaining their intentions and can be used as an explanation of why\nthey aren't using their corporate email.\n\nThe biggest difference between these types of emails and something like 419 scams — the\nclassic \"Nigerian prince asking for money\" scam — is that they are at least somewhat\ntargeted. The type and amount of targeting varies depending on the scenario. The most\ncommon examples we see are directed at email addresses that are publicly available,\ntypically from a company webpage or directory, and they appear to originate from someone\nelse who also works at that company. The type of person can change from owners, to\nexecutives, to directors. Regardless, it's someone with a management or ownership stake in\nthe company. The names of these individuals and their title is usually available on the\ncompany website or elsewhere on the internet. Sometimes, the email can be spoofed to look\nlike it actually originates from that user, but more often than not, it's just a generic email\naccount that looks something like 'executivedirector155878@gmail[.]com' or\n'lawfirm3053@outlook[.]com.'\n\nThe amount of and types of businesses that get targeted with these attacks is truly\nstaggering, ranging from huge multinational corporations down to small mom-and-pop\nrestaurants in U.S. cities. We found examples of small restaurants that are being targeted by\nimpersonating the owners, since the information was available on their website. These actors\nare prolific and thorough with accurate impersonations for the large majority of the\ncampaigns we saw. We did notice that there were repeated attempts at some of the larger\ntargets, potentially demonstrating their value to criminals. These attempts typically attack\ndifferent users at the same organization with similar themes and the same director/executive\nas the other messages.\n\n### COVID-19 impact\n\nThe themes for these campaigns were largely innocuous for a time. But just like every other\naspect of life, COVID-19 has had its effects. Beginning early in 2020, we started seeing\nCOVID being more actively integrated into these campaigns. The most common example\nwas a request for gift cards after the person in question was infected with COVID-19, an\nexample of which is below.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn this example, we can see the criminal is claiming to have been infected with COVID-19\nand it's preventing them from being able to buy things. This is obviously a ridiculous claim,\nbut could work nonetheless.\n\nThese were not the only types of themes we saw associated with COVID. As time went on,\nthe ways bad actors tried to profit off the pandemic shifted to helping with those dealing with\nlosses.\n\nOne particular exchange started as most did with a simple request for help as many of these\ncampaigns do:\n```\n\"How are you ? Hope you are keeping safe?. Are you available via email? I\nneed your help.\" [Sic]\n\n```\nThis particular victim responded to the initial request with some information about vaccination\nstatus and some projects they've been working on. Within hours, the criminal responded with\ntheir plea for gift cards, but this time, pulling at heartstrings by discussing children losing\nparents to COVID and adding sympathy for the elderly and ailing, as well:\n\nThanks for responding, Actually, I need to get GOOGLE PLAY GIFT CARDS for my Niece\nwho had Heart operation some days ago she had lost both parents to the disease (COVID19). It's her Birthday gift, but I can't do this right now because I have arthritis in the knees\nand ankles. They are giving me problems. I am going up and down one step at a time. This\nmethod is neither graceful! Or fast!, and I tried purchasing online but unfortunately no luck\nwith that. Can you get it from any store around you? I will reimburse you with the money\nspent. kindly let me know if you can handle this. [Sic].\n\nThe criminal pulls out all the stops to get their payoff. Luckily, in this particular example, the\ntarget realized the user was impersonating someone and no money was lost. Unfortunately,\nthat is not always the case. Amazingly, this wasn't the most heinous example of business\nemail compromise we found during our analysis. Below, there's an example of one of the\nworst campaigns we observed.\n```\nHi <Name>,\nAre you available? I need your help, I'm giving out gift cards to the\nhospice care unit for donation. Can you help me with some? You will be\nreimbursed.\nThank you,\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nIn this campaign, an executive is requesting the employee buy gift cards to hand out to a\nhospice care unit. This truly shows there are no lows these actors won't sink to to try and\nconvince people to give in to their monetary demands. This is further illustrated by the\nsuccessful campaigns we've analyzed and the ways these actors typically operate.\n\n### Process\n\nThe way this works is incredibly simple and requires nothing more than some social\nengineering skills and persistence to reach enough potential victims. We've walked through\nseveral examples of how this works and you can see the basic, high level, overview. It starts\nwith an innocuous, simple email asking for help, most times related to a gift card or other\nquickly monetizable purchase, but that request often doesn't show up until you initially\nrespond. Once the victim responds, the actor goes into action, requesting very specific\namounts of gift cards typically in the $300 - $500 range. Additionally, they will always request\nthat the victim open the cards, expose the gift card numbers, take a picture of it, and send it\nto them via email. This allows them to start the monetization process and with gift cards,\nthere's no additional cost to flip these to other individuals. This is not the end of the process\nthough, at this point the actors pivot and come at you harder. Typical responses to the first\ndelivery of gift cards is:\n```\nThanks, did you see my other message? I'm going to need more.\n\n```\nAt this point, the actor has realized they have an active victim that is willing to give them\nmoney and they begin to push even harder, going back again and again until the unfortunate\nvictim realizes they are being scammed. However, the damage is already done. Those gift\ncards are already sold and used. Despite being fairly simple and low-cost, these campaigns\nare surprisingly effective and their popularity is only increasing. However, these are not the\nonly types of business email compromise examples we see, some examples are a lot more\nsophisticated.\n\n### Acquisition-themed campaign\n\nOne of the more organized and large campaigns centered around acquisitions. This is a\n[tactic this particular group used before and they are still at it with almost continuous rounds](https://www.agari.com/email-security-blog/cosmic-lynx-returns-2021/)\nof emails. This group uses several different tactics to help ensure success with these\ncampaigns. First and foremost they work to actually spoof their initial email address in the\n\"FROM\" field. In most cases, these emails will have a subject that starts with \"Project,\"\nfollowed by either an acronym or code word of sorts. Examples include \"Violet,\" \"DKM,\"\n\"HLA\" and \"Cactus\". There was a variety in the terms used since this campaign has been\ngoing pretty steadily since late 2019. An example of some of the most recent emails are\nshown below.\n\n\n-----\n\nThese campaigns rely heavily on phone-based social engineering since they are asking the\ntarget to provide a phone number for someone to call. Additionally, the email addresses of\nboth the sender and receiver appear to be coming from the same company, but if you look\ncloser, that is not the case. In the image above, the company in question has been redacted,\nhowever, you can still see the reply-to address in the email (smtp-tls-outbound-eugateway@trustnet-gateway[.]cc).\n\nThis is the first obvious indicator that this email is not legitimate. If the target were to reply,\nthe email will be sent to that obviously illegitimate email. This is a typical behaviour for this\ngroup and the domains being used all try and leverage a sense of trust (i.e. trustnetgateway[.]cc, trustnet-server[.]cc) or network activity (gateway-resolver[.]cc,\nintranetgateway[.]net).\n\nHowever, if the user did work in acquisitions for a company and this email hit their inbox, the\nlikelihood of success seems higher. This is also demonstrated in the targeting of these\ncampaigns, since they appeared to hit a more curated list of victims. We didn't find a wide\narray of companies — small, medium and large — receiving emails. Instead, these tended to\nhit larger companies, Cisco included. They also tended to be a bit more descriptive than\nwhat we typically see, but in some cases, it was rather short and direct.\n```\nI hope you are doing well.\nWe are currently working on a sensitive acquisition and I will need your\nhelp to resolve certain matters by the close of the week.\nCan you please let me know when you are available and the best number to\nreach you at?\n\n```\nRegardless, they all used spoofed from addresses and leveraged the reply-to functionality to\ndirect traffic to an email address leveraging the four domains they controlled: trustnetgateway[.]cc, trustnet-server[.]cc, gateway-resolver[.]cc, intranetgateway[.]net. Some of the\nexamples were made to appear to come from mobile sources, others were typical signature\nblocks. These campaigns have continued steadily for quite some time with Cisco Talos\nfinding examples dating back to late 2019 in some cases. Despite their persistence, these\ncampaigns are typically not high volume, with a small number of emails coming out every\nfew weeks to a month.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Support contract theme\n\nA second campaign provided a slightly more sophisticated approach to these campaigns and\ncould result in a higher overall payout. These particular emails were related to something\nthat anyone who works in an enterprise is familiar with: support contracts. In an enterprise\nenvironment when a large purchase is made for hardware, software, or other technology, a\nsupport contract is likely part of the purchase — this allows the purchaser to do things like\nopen support tickets or get replacement parts when things break. Business Email\nCompromise (BEC) actors have realized that this is a common task organizations have to\ndeal with, incurring substantial cost, and they've tried to capitalize. We started seeing a\nseries of emails in mid-2020 with similar subject lines, all ending in \"Logistics Support\nRequest,\" with some acronym or company name at the beginning. For example, \"IDA\nLogistics Support Request:\"\n```\nSubject: IDA Logistics Support Request\nDear\nHope you are in good health?\nI need your help with a logistics support payment on behalf of IDA, for\n<company>.\nLook forward to your reply for more details.\nBest wishes, [Sic].\n\n```\nThis group also made use of the COVID pandemic, with references laced through some of\nthe emails. This serves two purposes in this context: It humanizes the criminal and provides\nan easy way to strike up a conversation with the victim, hopefully leading to a payout. After\nanalyzing several of these campaigns, we have a better understanding of how the attack\noccurs and the type of payout the attackers seek.\n\nOnce a victim responds to the initial email, the criminal begins asking for payment associated\nwith the support contract. In the examples we analyzed, the primary ask was for several\nthousand Euros or GBP specifically, indicating potential targeting of European companies for\nthis campaign.\n```\nApologies for the inconveniences, I need your assistance with a transfer of\n2'867 Euros, for a <company> Support payment. Our treasurer is indisposed\nand will not be able to make the transfer at the moment. I am away on a\nwork-related assignment and I do not have my internet banking access card\nreader to make the transfer and it is needed urgently. [Sic].\n\n```\nIn most of the examples we analyzed, the victim realized they were being scammed before\nthey sent any money, but again, this is not always the case. These actors typically just\nleveraged free email platforms, mostly Gmail accounts, to conduct these campaigns.\n\n\n-----\n\nThese actors try a variety of lures and means to achieve their financial goals. As with most\nthreats, there are different tiers of sophistication, with some extremely basic actors\nconducting what amounts to a modified 419 scam to organized groups that are targeting\nlarge organizations with intentions to achieve payouts in the thousands of dollars, at the very\nleast.\n\n### Language diversity\n\nOne aspect of Business Email Compromise that isn't commonly addressed is the languages\nthese attacks leverage. The majority of the emails are in English, but that is largely true for\nmalicious email. However, it was not the only language we observed being used in\ncampaigns. During our research, we identified several European languages and some Asian\ndialects, as well, although their volume was much lower than the English language examples\nof BEC. There were also strange examples where people attempted to use multiple\nlanguages, as in this example that asks for help in both German and French.\n```\nHallo\nIch brauche deine Hilfe, bitte.\nS'il vous plaît j'ai besoin de votre aide.\n\n```\nIt's important to realize that, especially if you are a multinational company or an organization\nthat does business in multiple different languages, you need to account for BEC attacks\nusing any of them. This may require additional filtering and terms that you are flagging based\non that information, but it is likely to catch more attempts than just focusing on English.\n\n### Protecting against BEC\n\nOne of the biggest challenges of addressing BEC is that these emails rely heavily on\ncommon language and leverage human nature to steal from their victims. As such, detection\ncan be a challenge. There are solutions in place, but always be aware that it can be difficult\nto ensure that only BEC emails are caught up in the net, which is one of the reasons many\norganizations rely on tagging of emails vs blocking them outright. The other part of this that\nmakes it challenging is the lack of URLs or attachments. These are common aspects of most\nmalicious emails that can be leveraged to help in detection.\n\nThe most common solutions involve identifying suspect emails that are originating from\noutside the organization. The challenge is determining what level of sensitivity to apply. If you\nmake detection and blocking too strong, it's likely you will block legitimate emails, which\ncould affect business. If you make detection too weak, you are adding risk that BEC emails\nwill reach users' inbox. There are a variety of ways BEC can be addressed in Cisco Secure\n\n\n-----\n\nEmail, up to and including add-ons such as the advanced phishing protection, which adds\nsender authentication and some additional BEC detection capabilities. However, there is a\nsecond layer to protecting against BEC: Educating users on how to spot it and what to do.\n\nOne simple step that some organizations can take is adding a tag to the subject line of the\nemail. This can be extremely useful to help users realize the request came from an external\nsource outside the organization and maybe question the incoming request with a little\nadditional scrutiny. This doesn't block the email outright, just adds a little context by changing\nthe subject and adding a tag like \"[External]\".\n\nThere are also a few key questions to ask yourself when seeking out BEC attempts. First,\nwhy is an executive emailing you from a Gmail/Yahoo/Outlook email address? Is this typical\nbehaviour? Would you typically respond to these requests? And are they using a generic\nsounding email (i.e. executivedirector9383489@gmail[.]com or lawfirm283@outlook[.]com)?\n\nLooking for a different reply-to address is another important way to identify them. This is\nsomething you will commonly see in marketing emails but typically shouldn't be found in oneto-one communications. If you hit reply, does the address you are replying to change? Is it to\nan unfamiliar domain? These are the first indicators that something isn't quite right. However,\nit isn't always easy to make that determination.\n\nLet's assume you're already in the process of being scammed, how would you determine\nsomething is off? Having read through thousands of these email campaigns and a fair\namount of potential victims, we have gleaned a couple of key things to ask during these\nexchanges. First and foremost is out-of-band verification. Before you commit to buying\nanything, try to communicate to the supposed sender directly through other means, such as\nan email to their official address or a DM on a social media platform. This could also be as\nsimple as a text message or phone call. We've come across countless examples of users\nstarting down the path to compromise, but by asking key questions, realize they are being\nscammed before any serious damage has been done.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThere is no silver bullet or one-size-fits-all solution for BEC. It's going to take a combination\nof technology and human capital to defeat this threat. One final note on that — if you do have\na user that stops these types of campaigns, reward them. They have saved your company a\nlot of potential loss, and by reinforcing the behavior, hopefully more employees will be willing\nto step up and stop these types of attacks from occurring. The problem of Business Email\nCompromise isn't going away and as we get better and better at stopping malware from\nrunning and exploitation from being successful, it's only going to get significantly worse.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis post contains basic and sophisticated examples of BEC and shows that they can be\nextremely effective. Most estimates have the revenue generated from BEC in the billions,\nand although a lot of attention gets paid to more destructive and aggressive threats like big\ngame hunting, it's BEC that generates astronomical revenue without much of the law\nenforcement attention these other groups have to contend with. If anything, the likelihood of\nthis has only increased in the pandemic, with people relying more and more on digital\ncommunication. The reality is these types of emails and requests happen legitimately all over\nthe world everyday, which is what makes this such a challenge to stop.\n\n## Coverage\n\nWays our customers can detect and block this threat are listed below.\n\n[Cisco Secure Email (formerly Cisco Email Security) can block malicious emails sent by](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/email-security/index.html)\n[threat actors as part of their campaign.
