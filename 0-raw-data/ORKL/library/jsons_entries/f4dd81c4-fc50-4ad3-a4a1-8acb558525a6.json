Preparation sessions – learning about Iranian airlines operating from Iranian airports. This included learning\n\n\nabout Operational Technologies (OT) used by the airlines and airports.\n\n\n2. Identifying the Database (DB) admins for the targeted airlines.\n\n\n3. Identifying the admins of various systems exposed to the internet.\n\n\n4. Breaching the targeted airlines network and attempting to compromise additional systems.\n\n\n5. Once within the network, obtaining admins' passwords.\n\n\n6. Identifying the DC.\n\n\n7. Exfiltrating the DC's logs.\n\n\n8. Exfiltrating the Events Security logs.\n\n\n9. Identifying various systems' IP addresses.\n\n\n10. Breaching critical servers via brute force techniques.\n\n\n11. Assessing if and how it is possible to breach the DB by analyzing the files (note – it is unclear what files the\n\n\ndocument is referring to).\n\n\n12. Accessing the DB.\n\n\nA specific clause to Malaysian Airlines – receiving the dump\n\n\n13. Exfiltrating the data.\n\n\n14. Compromising or creating Web servers to receive the data.\n\n\n15. Collaborating with other teams in order to analyze the data.\n\n\n**Attack on AirAsia**\n\nFirst stage – breaching their network.\n\n1. Obtaining the company's IP addresses.\n\n2. Conducting penetration tests on their network.\n\n3. Gathering a list of the all of the company's website as well as any other website linked to the company, and\n\nthen conducting on them penetration tests.\n\n4. Breaching any vulnerable asset.\n\nSecond stage – obtaining sensitive data.\n\n© 2019 All rights reserved to ClearSky Security Ltd.\nTh t t f th d t i l l f i t l Di t ib ti th t t id f i i t i ti i t itt d\n\n\n-----\n\n2. Levering compromised employee accounts to evaluate the systems admins.\n\n**Attack on Philippine Airlines**\n\n1. Using a VPN to access the company's internal network.\n\n2. Obtaining usernames and passwords for the company's work stations, servers, and email accounts.\n\n3. Evaluating the system admins and assets to determine whether it is possible and how to execute the attack.\n\n4. Leveraging the compromised data from the breached systems and DBs.\n\n**Problems the attackers encountered**\n\n1. Robust anti-virus installed on critical systems.\n\n2. Strong firewalls that prevented access to various ports.\n\n3. The use of a local Microsoft Office365 email server. As a result, even after the attackers obtained usernames\n\nand passwords they were unable to remotely login to them.\n\n4. Network segmentation – the internal network was not connected to the external network.\n\n**Attack on Thai Airways**\n\n1. The attackers used a compromised email of a Fly Dubai employee to send phishing emails to other\n\nemployees. The email contained an attachment of a malicious Excel file with various flight lists.\n\n2. This file was created by penetration team (likely Muddy Water). Out of the 40 recipiences 5 individuals\n\nopened the email and infected their computers.\n\n3. After they obtained these employees' usernames and passwords the attackers accessed two databases. The\n\nfirst was an Oracle DB, while the other was an IBM DB2 database.\n\n**Attack on the Azerbaijani Department of Health**\n\n1. Locating vulnerable websites hosted on the governmental network.\n\n2. Searching on Google for absolute address within the vulnerable websites.\n\n3. Attempting to execute SQL injections on these sites. This appear to have been unsuccessful.\n\n4. Creating shells on the databases.\n\n5. Using a shell to send remote commands to compromised computers. This method was conducted via\n\nDesktop Protocol (RDP).\n\n**Attack on the website – roshan.af**\n\nFirst stage – attempting to breach the network via a social engineering attack. This attack was unsuccessful as the\nnobody opened the malicious file. Concurrently, breaching the Linux system used by the website and injecting a\nshell. Note however that the Linux system had limited capabilities (it is unclear what the attackers meant by this).\nAfter considerable efforts the attackers eventually were able to install a hydra system. Afterwards the attackers\nexecuted a successful brute force attack on the SMB systems.\n\nThe attackers detail the most valuable type of data they were trying to obtain from the DB:\n\n1. Email addresses of directors and other key individuals in the organization.\n\n2. Types and version of the system used by the organization.\n\n3. Network layouts.\n\n© 2019 All rights reserved to ClearSky Security Ltd.\nTh t t f th d t i l l f i t l Di t ib ti th t t id f i i t i ti i t itt d\n\n\n-----\n\n5. List of active internal ports used by employees for purchases.\n\n6. List of port used for communication. It is unclear what the attackers mean by this. Possibly ports used by\n\nvarious chat programs.\n\n**Attack on Etihad Airways**\n\nThe attack on the UAE airline was executed via RDP – CITRIX account. Once in the attackers gathered intelligence,\nnotably usernames and passwords.\n\n##### A strategic document regarding the creation of Rana\n\n**First stage – the need for Rana**\n\nAccording to the document the leader of Iran it is vital to develop and expand the country's intelligence gathering\nand cyber capabilities (developing malware and viruses, various systems, etc.). Accordingly, they created a\nspecialized cyber espionage unite that also had the objective of protected the regime if need be.\n\n**Second stage – Rana's objectives**\n\n  - Propagating the Islamic culture and its ideas.\n\n  - Obtaining and providing the leader with strategic intelligence.\n\n  - Develop technological knowledge and capabilities.\n\n  - Conducting a cyber and intelligence warfare with the rest of the world.\n\n  - Utilizing Iranian experts, particularity members of universities in Tehran, as consultants on matters of infosecurity.\n\n  - Using these new skills and capabilities to promote and achieve the government's objective.\n\n  - Obtaining intelligence of value to various governmental departments and industrial sectors (note that the\nDepartment of Defense oversees the Iranian industrial-defense complex rather than the military).\n\n  - These objectives are then followed by more specific goals related to the Iranian population, including\nexpanding the intelligence gathering operation within the country by hacking Iranian universities, mobile\ncompanies, airports, etc. (note – it is unclear however the document possibly also refers to Iranian\nindividuals who have contacts to people outside of the country).\n\n**Rana sub-group – trojan and malware teams**\n\nThe objective of this sub-group is hacking, developing malware and attack tools, establishing and maintaining\nfoothold on compromised networks, etc. One other objective is using malwares to identify anyone who poses a\nthreat to the regime such as riot leaders.\n\nThe members of the group are experts in IT, encryptions algorithms, firmware, malware and virus development.\nFurther, they are fluent in various foreign languages.\n\nThe group can be categorized to several teams:\n\n  - Linux.\n\n  - Viruses (likely Microsoft based however this is unclear).\n\n  - MAC OS.\n\n  - Mobile.\n\n© 2019 All rights reserved to ClearSky Security Ltd.\nTh t t f th d t i l l f i t l Di t ib ti th t t id f i i t i ti i t itt d\n\n\n-----\n\nFrom the documents it appears that the Networks and web development are knowledgeable in the following\nsystems and languages:\n\n1. HTML, HTML5, CSS.\n\n2. PHP, Python, SCALA, RUBY AND RAILS, SPT, .NET.\n\n3. Javascript.\n\n4. SQL server, Mysql, Oracle, Nosql.\n\nFrom the documents it appears that other than IT skills, the mobile team is knowledgeable and has development\nskills in the following mobile operating systems:\n\n  - Android OS.\n\n  - IOS.\n\n  - Windows Mobile.\n\n##### Targeted entities\n\nThe main targets of the group are\n\n  - Governmental departments, agencies and offices.\n\n  - Airlines.\n\n  - Telecom companies.\n\n  - IT companies.\n\n##### Targeted countries\n\n**Asia** **Africa** **Other**\n\nSri Lanka Oman Egypt Fiji\nIndia Israel Morocco New Zealand\nUAE Turkey Ethiopia Australia\nDubai Iraq Kenia Colombia\nThailand Qatar South Africa\nPhilippines Lebanon Mauritius\nSyria Malaysia\nAzerbaijan Indonesia\nAfghanistan Kyrgyzstan\nPakistan Kuwait\nHong Kong Bahrain\n\n© 2019 All rights reserved to ClearSky Security Ltd.\nTh t t f th d t i l l f i t l Di t ib ti th t t id f i i t i ti i t itt d\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Iranian Nation-State APT Groups - Confidential Documents Leak\n Analysis of Targets, Plans, and Attack Vectors\n\n###### Summary of the Event\n\nOver the last few weeks, several significant leaks regarding a number of Iranian APTs took place. After analyzing and\ninvestigating the documents we conclude that they are authentic. Consequently, this causes considerable harm to\nthe groups and their operation.\n\nThe identity of the actor behind the leak is currently unknown, however based on the scope and the quality of the\nexposed documents and information, it appears that they are professional and highly capable. This leak will likely\nhamstring the groups' operation in the near future. Accordingly, in our assessment this will minimize the risk of\npotential attacks in the next few months and possibly even year.\n\nNote - most of the leaks are posted on Telegram channels that were created specifically for this purpose.\n\nBelow are the three main Telegram groups on which the leaks were posted:\n\n**Lab Dookhtegam pseudonym** (\"The people whose lips are stitched and sealed\" – translation from Persian) – In this\nchannel attack tools attributed to the group 'OilRig' were leaked; including a webshell that was inserted into the\nTechnion, various tools that were used for DNS attacks, and more.\n\n**Green Leakers** – In this channel attack tools attributed to the group 'MuddyWatter' were leaked. The group's name\nand its symbol are identified with the \"green movement\", which led the protests in Iran after the Presidential\nelections in 2009. These protests were heavily repressed by the revolutionary guards (IRGC)\n\n**Black Box** – Unlike the previous two channels this has been around for a long time. On Friday May 5[th], dozens of\nconfidential documents labeled as \"secret\" (a high confidentiality level in Iran, one before the highest - top secret)\nwere posted on this channel. The documents were related to Iranian attack groups' activity.\n\nThe documents leaked on Friday include:\n\nDocuments by the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence (comparable to the FBI and CIA) with information about a group\nknown as \"Rana\". At this stage, we cannot attribute the group to other known Iranian actors.\n\nThe documents shed light on some aspects of the group's activity, notably:\n\n   - Tracking Iranians\n   - Tracking Iranians citizens outside of Iran\n   - The group's members\n\nThese documents contain lists of victims, cyber-attack strategies, alleged areas of access, a list of employees, and\nscreenshots from internal websites relevant to espionage systems.\n\nFurther, a one of the document appears to be from the center for IT security incidents Kavesh\". Note however that\nthe it was adapted from the original document by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, and now also contains\ntheir symbol. This document was partly leaked and contained details regarding a development program of a\nmalware for attacking SCADA systems (similar Stuxnet).\n\nIn this item we review the documents relevant to Israel and to attack capabilities. We translated the documents\nindependently and did not use Google. Note that there are some ambiguous sentences.\n\n© 2019 All rights reserved to ClearSky Security Ltd.\nTh t t f th d t i l l f i t l Di t ib ti th t t id f i i t i ti i t itt d\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Rana team\n\nIn this leak there are numerous confidential documents with a level of \"secret\", which detail Rana's goals. They\nappear to have been written by a hacking and penetration team within the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence's cyber\noperations department.\n\n###### Infrastructure used by the team\n\nWe are continuing to examine these servers and will update on our findings.\n\n###### Proof that VMware is used to enter and trade with cryptocurrency wallets\n\nAmongst the documents there was also an image which, according to the leakers, proves an attempt to conceal\ncurrency procurement (perhaps due to the sanctions on Iran). This was done using a virtual environment – VMware\nserver.\n\n© 2019 All rights reserved to ClearSky Security Ltd.\nTh t t f th d t i l l f i t l Di t ib ti th t t id f i i t i ti i t itt d\n\n\n-----\n\n###### End of year Report 2015 (1394 according to Persian calendar).\n\nThe first pages from the 1394 end of year report (March 2015\n– March 2016) were leaked. They contain a strategic plan to\nhack airline companies and collect information about them.\nBased on this report we believe that hacking attempts on airline\ncompanies were carried out. The writers of the document\nstated that some important people in the country use\ninternational airlines, and therefore the following information\nshould be gathered:\n\n1. Information about flights.\n\na. Flights routes that could be under foreign\n\nsurveillance.\nb. Comprehensive information on identification\n\nscenarios of passengers and identifying important\npeople on the plane.\nc. Certain individuals that could board a flight in\n\ndisguise (for example, a scenario where with\nIranians citizens departs from Iran, and then fly to\nIsrael via another country such as Dubai).\nd. Information on suspicious people that boarded specific flights, for example \"the man\" who was on the\n\nflight from Tehran to Moscow on January 1[st], 2014, and flew on April 7[th], 2016 from London to Tel Aviv.\n2. Information about passengers in specific airlines (the airlines were not mentioned). Specifically - first\n\nname, last name, passport number, visa number, ethnicity, communication details, how the tickets were\nsold and bought.\n3. Information about the flight crew. For example, number of pilots on a flight from Dubai to London.\n4. Information about airline employees, with an emphasis on executives, managers, network admins, airport\n\nmanagers, and booking operators.\n5. Information about the airlines' finacial status.\n6. Information on equipment used by the company. This includes planes (e.g. number and type of planes,\n\ntheir condition, when they were used last, etc.) as well as computer equipment (number and type of\nservers and computers, etc.)\n\nNote - at the end of the page it is stated that in the next pages there will be a specific list of targets, but\nthis page is missing from this leak.\n\n###### Report on the first half of 1395\nIn another report on regarding 1395 (specifically March 2016 – August 2016), several tracking projects are\ndetailed. A documentation regarding attacks that were carried out on airlines' databases, including the Israeli\nairline 'Israir'. Below is a full translation of relevant parts of the document:\n\n  - The airline's database\n\n`o` Entering Qatar's database, and queries on flights.\n`o` Entering Israir's database.\n`o` Query on Dubai activity.\n`o` Query on Skyward's activity\n\n  - The Turkish police database\n\n  - Cooperation with these targets' attack groups.\n\n© 2019 All rights reserved to ClearSky Security Ltd.\nTh t t f th d t i l l f i t l Di t ib ti th t t id f i i t i ti i t itt d\n\n\n-----\n\n`o` Examining an insurance company's databases in Saudi Arabia\n`o` Examining RTA's databases from the UAE\n\nThe next page contains an R&D clause, with details on\nmeasures taken before attacks, preliminary research, and\npossible attack vectors. Some of the measures include:\n\n - A meeting with employees from the international\n\nairport in Tehran to learn about the airport's systems.\n\n\n\n- Research on various databases.\n\n\n\n- Research on using ORACLE and SQL server. In this\n\nregard, the attackers worked with SQL Loader and\n\nBulk insert in order to quickly enter databases, and\n\nwith BCP utility to copy the information from the\n\n\nservers.\n\n\nMoreover, the document also mentions gathering\ninformation on flights – mapping of assets that can be used\nto check-in, security procedures on the plane, and data\ncollection via the real-time flight tracking website\nFlightRadar24.\n\n###### Attacks on Israel\n\n**Attacks on insurance companies – A document with the title \"Hacking Israel's insurance companies\". It contains a**\nlist of Israeli insurance companies (see image below). Note that the title in Persian does not enable us to discern if\nit is an attack that already took place, or a list of future targets.\n\n**Attacks on hotel booking websites in Israel** – Below is a screenshot from a document with information about two\nhotel booking websites. It lays out the website's main activity, the access obtained, and the intelligence gathered.\n\n© 2019 All rights reserved to ClearSky Security Ltd.\nTh t t f th d t i l l f i t l Di t ib ti th t t id f i i t i ti i t itt d\n\n\n-----\n\nFurther, it alleges that they gained full access to the website's database. The documents contain information on 120\nthousand of the website's users, including name, password, and around 86 thousand credit cards.\n\n**Israeli airlines' databases** – Like the strategic documents, this document also mentions an attack against Israir.\nThe attack includes attempts to gather information from Israir's booking system's database, which mainly include\ninformation about bookings and credit cards. Due to the many error messages in the document, we cannot\ndetermine whether this attack succeeded or failed.\n\nThe attack was carried out on MSSQL 2000 servers that the company uses, and with the following user agent:\n\n© 2019 All rights reserved to ClearSky Security Ltd.\nTh t t f th d t i l l f i t l Di t ib ti th t t id f i i t i ti i t itt d\n\n\n-----\n\n**Attack on Teletus website and other hotel booking companies – a strategic report on an attack against the Israeli**\nfirm Teletus. Its goal was to obtain access to websites connected to hotel bookings in Israel. According to the report,\nthe breach was successful. The information was presented in a strategic report from Spring 1393 (April –May 2014),\nbut the nature of the report is unknown.\n\n**An attack on the Israeli Ministry of Agriculture – a table from a document with ambiguous content.**\n\nAttacks on non-Israeli targets\n\nIn addition to the above documents, there are also dozens of other documents relevant to other countries. For\nexample, several documents contain information on attacks against government ministries in Kuwait. The goal of\nthe attack was to obtain access to a Kuwaiti email service, and gather information on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs\nthrough it.\n\nA strategic report from the first half of 1396 (March – August 2017) describes activity carried out against Kuwait.\nAccording to this document, two teams worked on the attack: the hacking team, and the social engineering team.\nThe document was written in first person plural, and was most likely written by the attack team.\n\nBelow is an outline of the hacking team's operation\n\nAt first, the team carried out various tests, including penetration tests on systems of the Foreign Ministry. Then they\nmapped all the IP addresses, the domains, the websites, and the apps used by the ministry. The team carried out\nmore tests to see what is open and accessible in the network. They found out that they could obtain the highest\nlevel of control of the targeted servers.\n\nAfter a full examination, they transferred their conclusions to the social engineering team. The hacking team also\nobtained access to the ministry's employee database, and sent spam messages to everyone within the ministry in\norder to validate the emails using mail tracker.\n\nBelow is an outline of the social engineering team\n\n**Phishing – Phishing attacks on numerous firms, for example \"Atam Alanya\" hospital and the Qatari oil company.**\n\n**Spear-phising– The team communicated directly with people related to the Foreign Ministry.**\n\n© 2019 All rights reserved to ClearSky Security Ltd.\nTh t t f th d t i l l f i t l Di t ib ti th t t id f i i t i ti i t itt d\n\n\n-----\n\nwritten in Python, and planning the activity together with the technical teams.\n\nBased on another document that details an attack on the Foreign Ministry, it appears that the attack was successful.\n\n###### IRGC Documents\n\nAnother document with the IRGC symbol contains a plan named\n**project 910. It outlines development of a malware and a C2**\n(command and control) server.\n\nAccording to the report, the project intended to damage SCADA\nsystems. It is a botnet, but in fact behaves like an spy-malware with\nidentification, espionage and remote connection abilities. As of\n09/12/1394 (February 28[th], 2016- the date the document was\nwritten), the project was unsuccessful and did not achieve its goals\ndespite a large budget.\n\nAdditionally, we detected another document that extensively\ndetails the attack vector, but lacks the part about the bot in the\nleaked document. Further, the document does not have the IRGC\nsymbol.\n\nIn this item we review only the document leaked, based on the assumption that the malware was modified for\nproject 910.\n\nAttack vector as presented in the document:\n\nThe documents in our possession are incomplete. Accordingly, we are unable to provide a full and accurate\nassessment of the attack vector. Below are screen captures from the documents showing flow charts of the attack\nvector.\n\n_Attack vector – flow chart 1                                 Attack vector – flow chart 2_\n\n© 2019 All rights reserved to ClearSky Security Ltd.\nTh t t f th d t i l l f i t l Di t ib ti th t t id f i i t i ti i t itt d\n\n\n-----\n\n## Clearsky Cyber Security Report\n\n Overview and Analysis of Exposed Documents\n\n Targets, Plans, and Attack Vectors\n\n2018 ©All rights reserved to ClearSky Security Ltd.\nThe content of the document is solely for internal use.
