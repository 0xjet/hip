Further investigation uncovered a new variant of the Satori\n[botnet capable of aggressive scanning and exploitation of CVE-2017-18046 – Dasan](https://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/3552)\nUnauthenticated Remote Code Execution. Referred to as “Satori.Dasan,” it’s been rapidly\nexpanding with a high success rate. The C2/Exploit server for this botnet is 185.62.188.88\n(AS49349 – BlazingFast LLC, Ukraine)\n\nIt is not clear what is the purpose of this new botnet, as we were unable to find specific\nattack vectors in the binary.\n\nOur analysis suggests that Satori is looking to take over 40,000 IoT devices to join its\ngrowing family of cryptocurrency miners, as we saw [here, and](https://blog.fortinet.com/2018/02/02/satori-adds-known-exploit-chain-to-slave-wireless-ip-cameras) [here. This would make the](https://blog.netlab.360.com/art-of-steal-satori-variant-is-robbing-eth-bitcoin-by-replacing-wallet-address-en/)\nSatori.dasan malware a stage #1 infection, responsible for rapidly scanning the internet\nlooking for vulnerable devices.\n\n## Network Coverage\n\nOver the past two days Radware has detected over 2000 malicious Unique IPs daily, almost\n10 times higher than the daily average in the weeks prior.\n\nThe majority of the traffic came from Vietnam originating almost entirely from an ISP named\n‘Viettel.’\n\n\n-----\n\nA significant percentage of those malicious bots were also listening themselves on port 8080.\n\nBy sampling roughly 1000 IPs and querying their server headers, Radware revealed that\n95% identified themselves as running “Dasan Network Solution.”\n\nA quick [Shodan search revealed about 40,000 devices listening on port 8080, with over half](https://www.shodan.io/search?query=DasanNetwork+Solution)\nlocated in Vietnam, and not surprisingly an ISP named ‘Viettell Corporation.’\n\n\n-----\n\n## Botnet Activity: Distributed Scanning and Central Exploitation Server\n\nThe infected bots will perform aggressive scanning of random IP addresses, exclusively\ntargeting port 8080. Once it finds a suitable target, it notifies a C2 server which immediately\nattempts to infect it.\n\nSee the following sequence captured at one of Radware’s sensors (10.0.0.70):\n\n### Step #1\n\nThe infected bot sends a half-open stealth-scan SYN request to port 8080. Instead of Ack, a\nTCP Reset is sent. Typical to Mirai code, the initial TCP SYN packet contains a sequence\nnumber identical to the 32bit value of the target victim.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Step #2\n\nAfter 4 seconds, the bot establishes a 3-way TCP handshake to port 8080\n\n### Step #3\n\nThe following 113 bytes payload is sent:\n\nNote that this is not the actual exploitation attempt, but rather a screening process to find\nvulnerable hosts.\n\n### Step #4\n\nRadware’s Deception Network sensor is answering the probe with the following response:\n\nThe bot closes the connection.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Step #5\n\nNow comes the interesting part.\n\nNotice the timestamp – it is just 106 milliseconds after the last packet and we suddenly get\nan exploitation attempt from a completely different IP address. This IP belongs to a central\nexploitation server running on 185.62.188.88\n\nThe exploit server sends the following payload over HTTPS port 8080:\n\n## Investigating the Malware\n\nThe threat actors who operate this C2 Crime Server are responsible for numerous attacks\n[that were recently covered by different security vendors, including Fortinet,](https://blog.fortinet.com/2018/02/02/satori-adds-known-exploit-chain-to-slave-wireless-ip-cameras) [360netlab,](https://twitter.com/360netlab)\n[SANS.](https://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/What+is+going+on+with+port+3333/23215/)\n\nWith some scanning, fuzzing and Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT0) we found some\ninteresting details.\n\nAs with [previous incidents, the domain rippr.me is used to point to the C2 server.](https://twitter.com/360Netlab/status/961206650144247809)\n\nThe following entries have an associated TXT record:\n\n\n-----\n\nAs we saw in the exploit payload, the server is listening on port 7777. Connecting to it brings\nthe following download code:\n\nSo let’s get the file and check the contents:\n\n\n-----\n\nIt looks like a downloader that will be running on an infected device. The script downloads\nseveral versions of the binary and tries to execute it. If it fails (due to wrong CPU\narchitecture), it will just go over to the next one.\n\nLet’s grab the binaries (and guess some additional ones, like the x86_64). They look quite\nfresh according to server timestamps:\n\nAt the moment, [VirusTotal already knows about the C2 address and shows that less than five](https://www.virustotal.com/#/ip-address/185.62.188.88)\nantivirus products detect the files as malicious. Not very promising right now, but this should\nimprove.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe will use this opportunity to submit some of the binaries that are missing in VT.\n\n## Summary\n\nThe Satori.Dasan variant is a rapidly growing botnet which utilizes a worm-like scanning\nmechanism, where every infected host looks for more hosts to infect. In addition, it also has\na central C2 server that handles the exploitation itself once the scanners detect a new victim.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Read “2017-2018 Global Application & Network Security Report” to learn more.\n\n[Download Now](https://www.radware.com/social/ert-report-2017/?utm_source=RadwareBlog&utm_campaign=FixedCTA&utm_term=7840)\n\n### LEAVE A REPLY\n\nPlease enter your comment!\n\nPlease enter your name here\n\nYou have entered an incorrect email address!\n\nPlease enter your email address here\n\n\n-----",
