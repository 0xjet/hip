Conti affects all Windows operating systems and has been involved in more\nthan 400 incidents. Wizard Spider were soon rebranded in cyber press as the ‘Conti\nRansomware Gang’, though the group does not necessarily see itself as a ‘gang’. It prefers\nto present itself as a business.\n\n## The ransomware bubble\n\n[Ransomware has become a multibillion-dollar industry – and the Conti Ransomware Gang](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/10/heres-how-much-ransomware-attacks-are-costing-the-american-economy.html)\n[reportedly made up 15% of it in 2020. With this scale of income, groups like Conti find](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-is-a-multi-billion-industry-and-it-keeps-growing/)\nthemselves adopting some crude imitations of legitimate business practice. This corporate\nmimicry dictates that their victims be called ‘customers’, their extortion attempts ‘negotiations’\nand their criminal peers ‘affiliates’. They even publish ‘press releases’ via a dedicated Dark\nWeb site.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe gang s Ransomware-as-a-Service business model consists of employing affiliates,\ntraining them in Conti ransomware’s deployment and management, and then taking 30% of\nthe profits themselves. With exact profits known only to the malware writers and not the\naffiliates, however, the percentage Conti takes is often much higher than the 30% they claim.\n\nThere may not be checks and regulations in place to address fraud in the cyber underworld,\nbut one business complication which Conti have not been able to escape is that of the\ndisgruntled employee.\n\nUnhappy with the malpractice of their superiors, an underpaid affiliate leaked the Conti\nRansomware Gang’s training materials and the IP addresses for their Cobalt Strike C2\nservers in August 2021, declaring, “they recruit suckers and divide the money among\nthemselves”.\n\nMeanwhile, the US Government has also been taking action to try to disrupt the profit\nmargins of groups like the Conti Ransomware Gang, going as far as to impose sanctions on\ncryptocurrency exchanges seen as facilitating ransomware transactions. However, leaks and\nlegislation have proved far from fatal for Conti.\n\nThe reality is that these actions have not lost the Conti Ransomware Gang any of its socalled “customers”, and where there are customers there is profit. Any individual or\norganization entrusting their cyber security to conventional, rules-based measures is in their\ntarget market.\n\nDarktrace’s AI recently detected a Conti attack conducted along the lines of one of the\nmethods outlined in the August leak. The target organization – a US transportation company\n– was trialling Darktrace but, without Darktrace’s Autonomous Response set in active mode,\nthe attack was allowed to go ahead. In examining how it progressed, however, it should\nbecome clear not only how threatening double extortion ransomware attacks like this one\ncan be, but also how effectively they can be stopped by Darktrace at each stage of the\nattack.\n\nFigure 1: Timeline of the attack\n\n## Conti Ransomware Gang diversifies the ransomware playbook\n\nA single uninstalled Microsoft patch had left the target organization with dangerous\nProxyShell vulnerabilities. Conti exploited these vulnerabilities, quickly gaining the rights to\nremotely execute Exchange PowerShell commands on the company’s server and steadily\nbroadened its presence within the digital environment. This is a relatively new approach for\nthe Conti Ransomware Gang, who previously relied upon phishing attacks and firewall\nexploits. By diversifying its approach, it stays ahead of patches and intelligence.\n\n\n-----\n\nTwo weeks after the initial breach, C2 connections were made to an unusual endpoint\nlocated in Finland using an SSL client which appeared innocuous but was 100% rare for the\n[organization. Had Autonomous Response been set in active mode, Darktrace would have](http://10.10.0.46/autonomous-response)\nshut the connections down at this very early stage.\n\n[The IP address of this suspicious endpoint has since been identified as a Conti IoC (Indicator](https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2021/09/03/conti-affiliates-use-proxyshell-exchange-exploit-in-ransomware-attacks/)\nof Compromise), allowing it to be incorporated into rules-based security solutions. This would\nhave done little good for the company in question, however, which was breached weeks\nbefore this intelligence was made available.\n\nAs Conti continued to conduct internal reconnaissance and move laterally through the\ncompany’s digital environment, Darktrace detected further unusual activity. The suspicious\n[Finnish endpoint then employed new ‘Living off the Land’ techniques, installing the usually](http://10.10.0.46/blog/living-off-the-land-how-hackers-blend-into-your-environment)\nlegitimate tools AnyDesk and Cobalt Strike onto various parts of the environment.\n\nA series of SSL connections were made to AnyDesk endpoints and external hosts, one of\nwhich lasted 95 hours, indicating an active remote session conducted by one of Conti’s\naffiliates. At this stage, Darktrace had 10 distinct reasons to suspect an imminent attack.\n\n## Conti News: Closing the deal with double extortion ransomware\n\nDouble extortion has become the Conti Ransomware Gang’s new favourite sales tactic. If\nyou refuse to pay its ransom, Conti will not only take your most important files from you, but\nalso exfiltrate and publish them using its dedicated ‘Conti News’ website, or sell them directly\nto your competitors.\n\nHaving expanded their reach across the transport company’s network, the Conti affiliate\nbegan rapidly exfiltrating large quantities of company data to Conti’s preferred cloud storage\nsite, MEGA. Over four days, more than 3TB of data was uploaded, and then encrypted.\n\nTo avoid detection by a human security team, encryption was launched at close to midnight –\nConti’s ‘business’ does not respect business hours. When the company’s security team\nreturned to work the next day, they were met with a ransom note.\n\nAll of your files are currently encrypted by CONTI strain. ... .As you know (if you don’t\njust “google it“), all of the data that has been encrypted by our software cannot be\nrecovered by any means without contacting our team directly. .. If you try to use any\nadditional recovery software — the files might be damaged, so if you are willing to try\n— try it on the data of the lowest value... . To make sure that we REALLY CAN get your\ndata back — we offer you to decrypt 2 random files completely free of charge.\n\nYOU SHOULD BE AWARE ! Just in case, if you try to ignore us. We’ve downloaded a\npack of your internal data and are ready to publish it on our news website if you do not\nrespond. So it will be better for both sides if you contact us as soon as possible.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis attack was able to progress because Darktrace was only being trialed at this stage and\nwas therefore allowed to detect threats but not to take action against them. With\nAutonomous Response employed in active mode, this ransomware attack would have ended\nin the very early stages, when Darktrace detected its first suspicious connections.\n\nNonetheless, the Cyber AI Analyst was able to investigate and connect the dots of the attack\nautomatically, making the organization’s remediation efforts drastically quicker and easier\nthan they would have been without even this partial Darktrace deployment.\n\nFigure 2: Cyber AI Analyst generated this incident report following the initiation of data\nexfiltration\n\n## How the Conti Ransomware Gang evades cyber intelligence\n\nSecurity systems that rely on human intelligence to detect threats fit Conti’s ideal customer\nprofile perfectly. By adapting and diversifying their approach, moving from Ryuk to Conti, and\nfrom spear phishing and firewall exploits to this new ProxyShell approach, Conti stay ahead\nof regulations and hold on to their vulnerable customer base.\n\nEven if the Conti Ransomware Gang is brought down by leaks or legislation, other groups\nwill rise to fill the gap in the market, eager for their own cut of the illicit gains. If these groups\nare to be truly stopped, they must be made unprofitable.\n\n[The US government has tried to do this by imposing fines upon ransom payers, but](https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/fines-for-paying-ransomware-gangs/)\ncompanies still often consider the losses involved in not recovering their data too great. As I\n[have argued previously, ‘to pay or not to pay,’ is not the question we should be asking.](https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/opinions/ransomware-pay-or-not-pay-is-not/)\n\nIf you’re deciding whether to pay or not to pay, you’re already too far down the line.\nDarktrace stops groups like Conti at the first encounter. As this case has shown, Darktrace’s\nSelf-Learning AI is able to identify threats weeks before human analysts and threat\nintelligence can do the same, and neutralize them at every stage of an attack with\nAutonomous Response.\n\nThanks to Darktrace analyst Sam Lister for his insights on the above threat find.\n\n[Darktrace for Ransomware: Learn more](http://10.10.0.46/ransomware)\n\n## Technical details\n\n**IoCs**\n\nIoC Comment\n\n\n-----\n\n70.39.126[.]171 IP address of external endpoint used to gain foothold\non autodiscover server\n\n135.181.10[.]218 IP address of external endpoint which autodiscover\ncontacted (presumably) as a result of an external\nendpoint issuing a PowerShell command on the server\n\n64.120.44[.]116 IP address of external endpoint which potentially\nissued PowerShell commands to autodiscover server\n\n\n92.223.88[.]7\n\n64.31.35[.]242\n\n203.10.96[.]34\n\n103.253.43[.]112\n\n\nIP addresses of endpoints to which AnyDesk\nconnections were made\n\n\nPort 7070 AnyDesk port\n\nd1n2x5h0loustn[.]cloudfront[.]net Hostname of Cobalt Strike command and control\nservers\n\n\n13.226.235[.]221\n\n13.225.141[.]128\n\n13.225.141[.]32\n\n13.226.235[.]11\n\n\nIPs of Cobalt Strike commant and control servers\n\n\nrclone/v1.53.3 User-agent string used in HTTP data exfiltration\n\n.UGKMP File extension appended to encrypted files\n\n**Darktrace model detections:**\n\nDevice / Long Agent Connection to New Endpoint\nDevice / ICMP Address Scan\nAnomalous Connection / SMB Enumeration\nAnomalous Server Activity / Outgoing from Server\nCompromise / Beacon to Young Endpoint\nAnomalous Server Activity / Rare External from Server\nCompromise / Fast Beaconing to DGA\nCompromise / SSL or HTTP Beacon\nCompromise / Sustained SSL or HTTP Increase\nCompromise / Beacon for 4 Days\nAnomalous Connection / Multiple HTTP POSTs to Rare Hostname\nUnusual Activity / Enhanced Unusual External Data Transfer\nAnomalous Connection / Data Sent to Rare Domain\nAnomalous Connection / Uncommon 1 GiB Outbound\nCompliance / SMB Drive Write\nAnomalous File / Internal / Additional Extension Appended to SMB File\nAnomalous Connection / Suspicious Read Write Ratio\n\n\n-----\n\nAnomalous Connection / Suspicious Read Write Ratio and Unusual SMB\nAnomalous Connection / Sustained MIME Type Conversion\nUnusual Activity / Anomalous SMB Move & Write\nUnusual Activity / Unusual Internal Data Volume as Client or Server\nDevice / Suspicious File Writes to Multiple Hidden SMB Shares\nCompromise / Ransomware / Suspicious SMB Activity\nAnomalous File / Internal / Unusual SMB Script Write\nAnomalous File / Internal / Masqueraded Executable SMB Write\nDevice / SMB Lateral Movement\nDevice / Multiple Lateral Movement Model Breaches\n\n**MITRE ATT&CK techniques observed:**\n\nInitial Access T1190 – Exploit Public-Facing Applications\n\nExecution T1059.001 — Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell\n\n\nCommand and\nControl\n\n\nT1573 — Encrypted Channel\nT1219 — Remote Access Software\n\n\nDiscovery T1018 — Remote System Discovery\n\nT1083 — File and Directory Discovery\n\nExfiltration T1567.002 — Exfiltration Over Web Service: Exfiltration to Cloud\nStorage\n\nLateral Movement T1021.002 — Remote Services: SMB/Windows Admin Shares\n\nImpact T1486 — Data Encrypted for Impact\n\n## Justin Fier\n\nJustin is one of the US’s leading cyber intelligence experts, and holds the position of VP,\nTactical Risk and Response at Darktrace.
