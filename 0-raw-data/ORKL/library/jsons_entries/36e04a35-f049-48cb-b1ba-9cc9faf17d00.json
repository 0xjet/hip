Skilled and experienced to lead, coordinate and execute the response to the incident\n3. to inform the investigation into the incident and help gain an understanding of what has\n\nhappened, when, and how\n4. Technology to execute and actions that mitigate risk from the incident\n5. technology for incident response teams, to communicate and collaborate, delegate and\n\ntrack response actions, and manage delivery\n\n## Processes that document the considerations, decisions and actions to be taken in the event of an incident\n\nDocumented processes are key to effectively responding to an incident; they provide a guiderail for an experienced team, and a lifeline to the less experienced. While every team structures\ntheir processes differently, these might typically include:\n\n\n-----\n\n. A cyber incident response plan is the overarching document which details what the\norganisation (or, often a specific part of the organisation such as the SOC) does in\nresponse to a cyber incident. This may also be supported by other, related documents,\nsuch as an incident management framework, an IT incident management plan, or a\ndisaster recovery plan.\n. Technical runbooks provide detailed guidance on how front-line teams (e.g., the SOC or\nCSIRT) should respond in the event of a specific incident scenario. CERT SocGen’s\nprovides short examples of technical runbooks.\n. Knowledge articles provide detailed guidance on specific actions that underpin the\nresponse to one or more incident scenarios. This might include, for example, analysing a\npotentially malicious IP address, isolating an endpoint from the network, or resetting a\nuser’s Active Directory credentials. Knowledge articles are typically held in a wiki, using\nsoftware such as or .\n\n## Skilled and experienced people to lead, coordinate and execute the response to the incident\n\nLarger cyber security teams typically have a dedicated cyber incident response function,\nwhereas others might move staff into this function as and when required. Some teams may lack\na cyber incident response function altogether, and rely exclusively on outsourced providers.\nRegardless of how the function is resourced, cyber security teams should ensure they have\naccess to the skills and experience needed to lead, coordinate and execute the response to an\nincident.\n\nThe necessary skills and experience are not just digital forensics and incident response, but\nextend to wider cyber security, IT, and business. The NIST Workforce Framework for\nCybersecurity articulates many of these (although doesn’t cover many of the “soft” skills\nneeded).\n\nIf in-house, the cyber incident response function should be resourced and structured to reflect\nthe nature and extent of its role, with well-defined job descriptions for staff, and suitably detailed\ntraining plans to allow staff to maintain currency and enable progression. If outsourced, there\nshould be a clear view as to what skills and experience are accessible, when, and how.\n\n## Logs to inform the investigation into the incident and help gain an understanding of what has happened, when, and how\n\nLogs provide the evidence for an investigation into an incident, and help to gain an\nunderstanding of what has happened, when, and how. (Logs also provide a mechanism for\ndetecting threats in the first place, but that’s not something I’ll cover here.)\n\nAs such, teams should ensure they have the right logs available, for the right amount of time,\nand that these are accessible in the right ways.\n\n\n-----\n\n## What logs to store\n\nThe choice of which logs to store (and which not to) should be aligned to the likely real-world\nthreat and investigative requirements. Logs should be stored which help the team to do their job\nand answer key questions like “what systems did the attacker connect to?” or “was any data\n_stolen?” in likely incident scenarios._\n\nAny applicable regulations should also be considered when determining what logs to store. For\n[example, the GDPR’s requirement for “data minimisation” means that security logs should not](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/principles/data-minimisation/)\ncontain personal data unless this is specifically required for the purpose the logs are\nthemselves stored (i.e. to enable the investigation of potentially malicious activity). If personal\ndata is stored, then the logs should be handled appropriately (i.e. according to the other\n[requirements of the GDPR, such as accuracy and](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/principles/accuracy/) [security).](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/principles/integrity-and-confidentiality-security/)\n\n## How long to store logs for\n\nThe choice of logging retention periods should again be aligned to the likely real-world threat\nand investigative requirements. Logs should be stored for the amount of time that they will\ntypically be of use to the team.\n\nThis might be, for example, based on the average dwell time of likely attackers. FireEye’s 2021\nM-Trends report identified a median dwell-time for non-ransomware investigations of 45 days,\nwith 25% of these non-ransomware investigations having a dwell time of 200+ days. If incidents\nare going to be investigated that occurred 200 days ago, the logs should be available to enable\nthis.\n\n\n-----\n\nGlobal dwell time during 2020 broken down by investigation type (Source: )\nAgain, any applicable regulatory requirements should be considered when determining\nretention periods. For example, PCI-DSS requires a minimum retention period of one year.\n\n## Making logs accessible\n\nLogs should be accessible to cyber security teams, whatever is stored and however long they\nare stored for.\n\nLogs should be initially stored in a central location so they can be correlated with each other,\nand accessed by analysts ideally through a “single pane of glass”. Access should be nearinstant, with the ability to rapidly search through and analyse data.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs logs age, they may be moved to different locations (for example, to warm or cold storage).\nThey should remain accessible, however, this may be slower to achieve with less compute\npower readily available for analysis, reflecting their drop in usefulness.\n\n## Technology to execute containment and eradication actions that mitigate the risk from the incident\n\nTechnology should be in place to execute containment actions that temporarily limit the\nattacker’s ability to do further harm, and to execute eradication actions that remove their access\nto the environment.\n\nExample containment and mitigation actions that might be taken (primarily with a network\nintrusion scenario in mind) are shown below; incident response teams should ideally have direct\naccess to technology or tools which perform these actions, or otherwise be able to easily\nrequest these actions and have defined SLAs in place for their completion.\n\nExample host-based containment and eradication actions include:\n\nSwitching off systems, or restarting systems.\nIsolating hosts from the environment to prevent further attacker actions on the host, or\nlateral movement from it.\nIdentifying (e.g., based on file name or path) and removing files from hosts.\nBlocking files from executing on hosts.\nRemoving persistence mechanisms (e.g., services, registry keys, startup folder items)\nfrom hosts.\n\nExample network-based containment and eradication actions include:\n\nBlocking known IOCs (e.g., IP addresses, domains, or traffic signatures) on external\nnetwork infrastructure to prevent malware calling home, or the attacker connecting in.\nIsolating one or more areas of the network.\n\nExample identity-based containment and eradication actions include:\n\nChanging account permissions, access or privileges (e.g., remove unauthorised\nadministrator privileges).\nResetting individual account credentials (including Active Directory user and service\naccounts, application accounts, and cloud provider accounts).\nDisabling accounts.\nResetting credentials at scale.\n\n## Capability for incident response teams to communicate and collaborate, delegate and track response actions, and manage delivery\n\n\n-----\n\nCyber security incidents are often complex and fast-moving, and organisations may have\nmultiple incidents of varying complexity and severity taking place at any one time. The ability for\nresponse teams to work effectively in such circumstances is key. Effective working in a cyber\nincident response scenario requires the following capabilities:\n\n. Synchronous (e.g., video and phone calling and conferencing) and asynchronous (e.g.,\ntext chat) communication internally and with external partners.\n. Collaborating on work internally and with external partners.\n. Documenting the tasks required to respond to the incident, tracking due dates, effort,\nstatus, assignees, and next steps. This can be achieved with something as simple as a\nspreadsheet, or a purpose-built task tracking system like Jira.\n. Capturing key statistics for each incident (e.g., using common schemas such as ), and\noutputting these to enable management reporting.\n\nAll of these capabilities should be resilient (i.e., remain available in the event of a domain\ncompromise or destructive attack) and secure (i.e., monitor and prevent eavesdropping by an\nattacker).\n\n\n-----",
