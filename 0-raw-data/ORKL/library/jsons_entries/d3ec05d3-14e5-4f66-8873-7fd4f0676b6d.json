This group’s tactics, techniques and procedures(TTPs)\n[overlap with groups known as Charming Kitten,](https://www.clearskysec.com/the-kittens-are-back-in-town-2/) [Phosphorus and](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2019/03/27/new-steps-to-protect-customers-from-hacking/) [TA453.](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/operation-spoofedscholars-conversation-ta453)\n\nSince our initial report on the group’s [training videos in May 2020, X-Force has uncovered additional](https://securityintelligence.com/posts/new-research-exposes-iranian-threat-group-operations/)\noperational security errors by this group. Our continued analysis led to the discovery of a malicious tool\nthat has not been previously linked to this threat actor, a custom Android backdoor we named\n“LittleLooter.” LittleLooter has only been observed being used by ITG18. X-Force is not aware of other\nthreat actors leveraging this backdoor.\n\nAdditionally, from August 2020 through May 2021, X-Force observed ITG18 successfully compromise\nmultiple victims aligned with the Iranian reformist movement. Given the timing and focus of the activity,\nthis may have been in support of surveillance objectives leaving up to the June 2021 presidential\nelections in Iran. Finally, despite continued OPSEC errors, ITG18 appears to conduct a sizeable and\noften successful operation that heavily focuses on compromising personal webmail and social media\naccounts.\n\n## LittleLooter, ITG18’s Android Surveillance Tool\n\nX-Force researchers discovered a file named “WhatsApp.apk” (md5:\na04c2c3388da643ef67504ef8c6907fb) on infrastructure associated with ITG18 operations.\n\n_Figure 1: Open Directory listing for ITG18 server hosting victim exfil and LittleLooter (Source: X-Force)_\n\nUpon further analysis, X-Force determined “WhatsApp.apk” was Android malware that we named\n“LittleLooter” based on its information stealing capabilities.\n\nFor C2 communication, LittleLooter attempts to establish communication to the C2 server via HTTP\nPOST requests and responses. The C2 server masquerades as an American flower shop and has\nbeen active since July 2020. The communication between the malware and the C2 server is\ncompressed via GZIP, AES encrypted and BASE64 encoded. The AES key and initialization vector\n(IV) are hardcoded into the sample:\n\n\n-----\n\n**KEY:  3544c085656c997**\n\n**IV:   4fcff6864c594343**\n\nLittleLooter is functionally rich, providing ITG18 operators the following capabilities on an infected\nAndroid device:\n\nRecord video Call a number\n\nRecord live screen Upload/download/delete a file\n\nRecord sound List storage information\n\nRecord voice call Gather GPS- or GSM-based location\n\nList device information Show network activity\n\nDeterminate whether screen is on or off Show network speed\n\nList installed apps Show network connectivity\n\nSend browser history Turn on/off Wi-Fi\n\nTurn on/off Bluetooth Turn mobile data on/off\n\nList contact information List SIM card information\n\nList SMS inbox/outbox/drafts Take a picture\n\nList calls including received and missed calls\n\nThe LittleLooter sample X-Force analyzed had the version number “5”, as well as an update capability\nif LittleLooter detected it was running a previous version. The tool updates itself by downloading a zip\nfile from a URL on the C2 server: “http[:]//[C2server]/updates/update_[class name].zip” and replacing\nthe old “classes.dex” file with the newer version from the zip file. Finally, LittleLooter is a modified\n[version of Android malware reported by third party researchers several years ago and has likely been](https://irancybernews.org/news/corrupt-kitten-exposed/)\nin use by ITG18 for years prior to our association with this threat group.\n\n## New Targeting Supports Possible Surveillance Objectives\n\nIn addition to the discovery of LittleLooter, X-Force researchers discovered ITG18 targeted Iranian\nindividuals from late summer 2020 through spring 2021, which supports ITG18’s long-standing\noperations against Iranian citizens of interest. X-Force has found that despite public reporting of their\n\n\n-----\n\nOPSEC mistakes, ITG18 continues to leave archive files containing exfiltrated victim information on\nopen servers and in open directories. The new analysis by X-Force revealed ITG18 exfiltrated roughly\n120 gigabytes of information from approximately 20 individuals aligned with the Reformist movement in\nIran.\n\nSimilar to exfiltrated information X-Force observed ITG18 steal last summer, this new stolen data was\nfrequently extracted using legitimate utilities associated with the compromised accounts. Most recently,\nthose were Telegram accounts, one of the most popular instant messaging services used in Iran.\nTelegram is one of the only foreign social media services permitted for use in Iran and was heavily\n[used during the 2009 Green Movement to organize protests. X-Force researchers believe the victims’](https://www.politico.eu/article/irans-telegram-revolution/)\nTelegram data was possibly targeted during the summer 2020 through spring-2021 time frame to\nsupport monitoring any dissent or protests around Iran’s 2021 June Presidential Election.\n\nWhile X-Force did not observe how initial access to the accounts was gained, ITG18 could have\nleveraged LittleLooter’s capabilities or used phishing/social engineering to gather account credentials\nfrom their targets.\n\n_Figure 2: Victim’s Telegram account data exported by ITG18 (Source: X-Force)_\n\nBased on the exfiltrated information X-Force observed, most of the victims were associated with Iran’s\nReformist movement, a political faction within Iran that supports more leftist policies versus the current,\nconservative regime. The stolen data contained photos associated with the victim, contact lists, group\nmemberships and conversations.\n\n## A Sizable Operation Marches On\n\nThe information X-Force has gleaned on ITG18’s activity, in conjunction with the training videos XForce found in the summer of 2020, continues to paint a picture of a threat actor that likely leverages a\nconsiderable number of personnel. This is underpinned by how manual and labor-intensive ITG18\noperations appear to be, from gaining initial access to individual victim accounts to carefully reviewing\nexfiltrated data.\n\nSeveral open-source reports have noted how ITG18 operators, beyond simply sending phishing\n[messages, will also attempt to chat, call, and even video conference with targets. This personalized](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/operation-spoofedscholars-conversation-ta453)\nattention to each compromised individual likely requires hands-on work from a large number of\noperators. While X-Force cannot confirm how many individuals and organizations ITG18 has targeted\nrecently, what has been observed so far in 2021 is identification of over 60 servers hosting more than\n100 phishing domains which suggests there may be a large number of victims\n\n\n-----\n\nX-Force has also observed how manual ITG18 operations can be when reviewing exfiltrated\ninformation. Through some of the videos that X-Force discovered last summer, an ITG18 operator was\nobserved spending hours in manual work. They were seen validating credentials by copying and\npasting stolen victim usernames and passwords into a wide variety of websites, for just two victims. XForce alone has observed almost 2 terabytes of compressed exfiltrated data on publicly accessible\nITG18 servers since 2018. This likely represents only a small portion of the data actually stolen by this\nadversary. Coupled with the training videos X-Force discovered, suggesting ITG18 has enough\nturnover or growth to warrant training, this likely indicates ITG18 requires a significant number of\npersonnel for operations, as well as for processing and evaluating exfiltrated information.\n\n## Anticipate Activity for the Foreseeable Future\n\nITG18 operations persist despite numerous public disclosures of their insecure activity and stolen data,\nspeaking to the ability of this group to continue on its mission. X-Force researchers have high\nconfidence that ITG18 activity will continue regardless of public reporting due to their broad objectives\nand continued success of their operations.
