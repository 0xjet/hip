A key cog in this growing\noperation is the interdependency between those who specialize in selling access to\ncompromised systems or stolen information, and those looking to launch ransomware\nattacks.\n\nData gathered by Intel 471 points to a pattern in numerous ransomware attacks that have\noccurred in the past 18 months: Criminals in underground forums will advertise access to\nvarious breached organizations, and quickly turn to sell access to the highest bidder or strike\na deal with an ransomware affiliate in order to share in any profits pulled from a successful\npayment. These partnerships have resulted in a flourishing submarket, where access to\ncorporate networks is sold for six-figure sums directly or via a partnership and cut of paid\nransoms.\n\nThe compromised credentials are mostly obtained through attackers abusing flaws or\nsecurity shortcomings in virtual private networks or remote desktop protocol endpoints,\nwhich provides the initial entry point into enterprise networks. Additionally, credential\ninformation can come from logs tied to infostealer malware, password spraying or other\ncredential marketplaces in the criminal underground.\n\nInstances show that anywhere from one week to six months after access is obtained and\nadvertised, other known actors on various underground forums look to use or purchase that\naccess to launch ransomware attacks. The targets run the gamut of regions and economic\nsectors, with the pattern playing out in ransomware attacks on every continent.\n\nOne of the highest-profile ransomware attacks to fit this pattern was the attack on Pemex, the\nstate-run oil company based in Mexico. In November 2019, attackers hit Pemex with\nDoppelPaymer, demanding $4.5 million in bitcoin to decrypt and return the files.\n\n\n-----\n\nIntelligence from Intel 471 found that beginning in June 2019, a separate actor was\nadvertising access to 1,500 Pemex servers and personal computers, as well as administrator\nprivileges to the company’s domains, for $150,000. That transaction was facilitated through\na third-party escrow service, which allows criminals to move money in order to shield\nthemselves from making direct contact with the actors who are carrying out the crimes.\n\nAnother actor Intel 471 had been tracking started asking for access to ransomware-as-aservice affiliate programs, stating that deployment of ransomware on compromised networks\nshould potentially return much more money than just selling the access. Days after this,\nIntel471 learned the actor obtained and modified a version of Thanos, and allegedly deployed\nit against U.S. businesses. Over the past three months, this actor has frequently tried to sell\naccess to compromised organizations, which range in location, size, and economic sector.\n\nAccess merchant partnerships are not exclusive to any one particular ransomware variant or\nransomware-as-a-service. Data from Intel 471 shows this pattern following attacks carried\nout with popular ransomware variants, such as DoppelPaymer, Maze, Netwalker, Ryuk and\nREvil, as well as lesser-known variants like LockBit, Nefilim, Pysa and Thanos.\n\nThe astronomical growth in ransom payments in 2020 has helped access merchants put a\npremium on their services. In years past, a large ransom payout would earn attackers\nsomewhere between five- and six-figure sums. Now, it’s becoming increasingly common for\nattackers to demand seven- and eight-figure ransoms, partly due to the need to pay off actors\nthat have helped them obtain access to the victim’s system.\n\nOne such attack drives home this point: Intel 471 obtained a chat log from a ransomware\nattack launched last month where a company — a U.S.-based healthcare provider — offered\nto pay a ransom of just under $400,000. Despite the company’s quick response, the\nransomware crew was insulted by the offer and threatened to dump the entire cache of stolen\ndocuments unless the figure was pushed several million dollars higher. With their backs\nagainst the wall, the company eventually settled to pay $2 million in bitcoin.\n\nHow long ransomware crews decide to stay with this partnership model will be something to\nwatch in the coming year. Intel 471 has observed actions in underground marketplaces that\nshow RaaS groups are beginning to undercut access merchants, by either purchasing their\nown credential-stealing malware or recruiting teams that specialize in obtaining access. Use\nof access merchants may not disappear completely, but the extent of their popularity could\ndiminish.\n\nTo prevent being a victim, enterprises need to have continuous and proactive observation of\nthe cybercriminal underground marketplace where these interdependent products, services\nand goods intersect. Additionally, ensuring token-based multi-factor authentication is\nenabled across an enterprise and scrutinizing all internet-facing remote network connections\nlike RDP can be vital in preventing ransomware attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\n_This article was part of a series on ransomware attacks in 2020.
