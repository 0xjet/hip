This data is provided to\nhelp cyber security professionals and system administrators guard\nagainst the persistent malicious actions of cyber actors.

Since its emergence in June\n2019, DoppelPaymer ransomware has infected a variety of industries\nand targets, with actors routinely demanding six- and seven-figure\nransoms in Bitcoin (BTC). Prior to infecting systems with ransomware,\nthe actors’ exfiltrate data to use in extortion schemes and have made\nfollow-on telephone calls to victims to further pressure them to make\nransom payments.\n\n### Threat Details\nDoppelPaymer ransomware attacks since June 2019 have negatively\nimpacted the provision of healthcare, emergency, and education\nservices to citizens worldwide.\n\n\nThe following information is being provided by the FBI, with no\n\n\n-----\n\n### Healthcare\n\nIn September 2020, a DoppelPaymer attack against an identified hospital in Germany left emergency\nservice personnel unable to communicate with the hospital. At least one individual requiring\nemergency services was re-routed to a hospital 20 miles away. This individual later died, though\nGerman authorities ultimately did not hold the ransomware actors responsible because the German\nauthorities felt the individual’s health was poor and the patient likely would have died even if they had\nnot been re-routed. After German authorities contacted the actors through the provided\ncommunication accounts, the actors withdrew the extortion attempt and provided a digital decryption\nkey upon learning patients’ lives were endangered, according to open source reporting about the\nGerman investigation.\n\nIn July 2019, DoppelPaymer actors infected 13 out of 380 servers used by an identified US medical\ncenter with ransomware. The actors demanded a 50 bitcoin ransom, which, at the time of infection,\nwas worth approximately $600,000. The medical center required several weeks to restore their\nsystems from offsite backups following the ransomware attack.\n\n### Emergency Services\n\nIn September 2020, DoppelPaymer actors compromised an identified county’s E911 Center and made\nchanges, preventing officials from accessing the county’s computer-aided dispatch (CAD) system. The\nactors reset passwords, removed accounts from the domain administrators group, and created an\nadmin account called “AD.” In a separate attack on a different county, the actors encrypted servers\nused by the county responsible for emergency dispatch, patrol, jail, and payroll departments.\n\nIn summer 2020, a DoppelPaymer attack disrupted police and emergency services as well as other\ngovernment functions for an identified US city, forcing them to revert to manual operations to\ncontinue essential services to the community. The ransomware was introduced via an Internet\nExplorer/Edge browser after an employee viewed a cryptocurrency website. The city’s system was\ninfected by a Dridex malicious advertisement campaign through the browser’s temporary internet files.\nThe ransomware was successful in encrypting files stored on the following platforms: Windows 7,\nWindows 10, Server 2008, Server 2012, and Server 2016.\n\n### Educational Institutions\n\nIn September 2020, DoppelPaymer actors targeted an identified community college, resulting in school\nofficials’ limiting physical access to the campus for several days, impacting in-person classes. The actors\nclaimed to have exfiltrated files, and provided the victim a TOR site, contact email, and BTC wallet for\n\n\n### Healthcare\n\n\n-----\n\ncontact and payment. During remediation efforts, malicious file “rdel.exe” was found on multiple\nmachines. If the file were run in the command line with a corresponding CRC32 hash, the “rdel.exe” file\nwould execute.\n\nIn July 2020, DoppelPaymer actors infected networks used by a different identified community college.\nDue to the infection, the college restricted network access to all but IT and maintenance staff. The\nmalware infected servers at three of the college’s campuses but did not infect cloud-based\napplications.\n\n### Additional Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures\n\nDoppelpaymer is one of the first ransomware variants where actors have called the victims to entice\npayments. As of February 2020, in multiple instances, DoppelPaymer actors had followed ransomware\ninfections with calls to the victims to extort payments through intimidation or threatening to release\nexfiltrated data. In one case an actor, using a spoofed US-based telephone number while claiming to be\nlocated in North Korea, threatened to leak or sell data from an identified business if the business did\nnot pay the ransom. During subsequent telephone calls to the same business, the actor threatened to\nsend an individual to the home of an employee and provided the employee's home address. The actor\nalso called several of the employee’s relatives.\n\n### Recommended Mitigations\n\nThe FBI does not encourage paying a ransom to criminal actors. Paying a ransom may embolden\nadversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to engage in the\ndistribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities. Paying the ransom also does not guarantee\nthat a victim’s files will be recovered. However, the FBI understands that when businesses are faced\nwith an inability to function, executives will evaluate all options to protect their shareholders,\nemployees, and customers. Regardless of whether you or your organization have decided to pay the\nransom, the FBI urges you to report ransomware incidents to your local field office or the FBI’s Internet\nCrime Complaint Center (IC3). Doing so provides investigators with the critical information they need\nto track ransomware attackers, hold them accountable under U.S. law, and prevent future attacks.\n\n  - Ensure backups are secure and are disconnected from the network at the conclusion of each\n\nbackup session.\n\n  - Audit user accounts regularly, particularly Remote Monitoring and Management accounts that\n\nare publicly accessible. Patch operating systems, software, firmware, and endpoints.\n\n  - Monitor inbound and outbound network traffic; set alerts for data exfiltration.\n\n\ncontact and payment. During remediation efforts, malicious file “rdel.exe” was found on multiple\n\n\n-----\n\n  - Apply two-factor authentication to user login credentials, receiving responses by text rather\n\nthan email as actors may be in control of victim email accounts.\n\n  - Implement least privilege for file, directory, and network share permissions.\n\n### Reporting Notice\n\nThe FBI encourages recipients of this document to report information concerning suspicious or criminal\n[activity to their local FBI field office.
