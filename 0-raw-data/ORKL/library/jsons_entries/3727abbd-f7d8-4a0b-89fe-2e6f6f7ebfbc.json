Troldesh encrypts a user’s files with an “.xtbl” extension.\nTroldesh is spread initially via e-mail spam.\n\nA distinctive feature of the Troldesh attack is direct communication with the victim. While the\nmost Ransom-Trojan attackers try to hide themselves and avoid any direct contact,\nTroldesh’s creators provide their victims with an e-mail address. The attackers use this\nemail correspondence to demand a ransom and dictate a payment method.\n\nIn this report you’ll learn about the infection procedure, the primary symptoms, and you will\nfind out how I ended up getting a discount from the hackers.\n\n## The Infection Process\n\nAs mentioned previously, Troldesh is a Trojan which encrypts all the user’s data and\ndemands a ransom in exchange for decryption.\n\nIn my research, I used a malicious sample with this hash downloaded from VirusTotal:\n_a8b27aa4fe7df15a677f9ab9b62764d557525059a9da5f4196f1f15049e2b433_\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter execution, Troldesh encrypts all of the user s data and displays this message:\n\nAdditionally, it renames the encrypted files using this format: [random characters]=.xbtl For\nexample, this is a screenshot of my machine’s “Pictures” folder with the encrypted files:\n\nApproximately 20 txt files were placed on my desktop. In other cases, a txt file was placed\nin each folder that had an encrypted file.\n\nEach txt file has the filename in the format README[number].txt and looks like this:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe user is instructed to send a specified code to the e-mail address provided.\n\nTo summarize, a Troldesh infection displays these characteristics:\n\nA warning message on the user’s screen\nRegular files replaced by the encrypted files with the .xbtl extension\nREADME[number].txt files for information and contact data\n\n## How I Got a Discount From the Hackers\n\n\n-----\n\nI was very interested to learn more about the ransom and tried to start a correspondence\nwith the attackers. As required, I sent the specified code to the e-mail address provided,\none that is registered on the most famous Russian domain.\n\nAfter several minutes I received an answer with my next instructions.\n\nThe extortionists said to send them one encrypted file to prove they could decrypt it. They\ndemanded 250 euros to decrypt all of the files.\n\nSomething about this transaction bothered me. Was their answer generated automatically\nor was there a real person on the other end? To find out, I decided to accept the hackers’\n“generous” offer and send them an encrypted file for decryption. At the same time, I tried to\nstart a conversation with them to see whether I could persuade them to give me the key for\nfree, or at least get a decent discount.\n\n\n-----\n\nTo my great surprise, after a minute I got an answer from a real person who was open to\ndiscussion! Since the answer and all of the following conversation were in Russian, a\ntranslation is provided under each screenshot.\n\n_“The guarantee is our word of honor. You can pay in rubles, 12000 RUB.”_\n\nI checked the currency exchange rate and saw that I received a discount of approximately\n15% (~35 euro). A decrypted version of the encrypted file I sent earlier was attached to the\nsame e-mail.\n\n\n-----\n\nI continued asking about payment methods and if there was a specific time frame.\n\n_“How can I pay? I don’t see any requisites. Are there any time frames?”_\n\n_“The payment should be done to the QIWI purse, requisites are changing frequently. As_\n_soon as you will be ready to pay write me and I’ll send an actual requisites_\n\n\n-----\n\n_12000 RUB is a sum with discount!_\n_You have only 2 days to pay.”_\n\nI took a break at this point and after almost a week wrote them again. I still had hopes of\ngetting the key for free.\n\n_“I ask you: please, return my data – this is almost all of my life for the last several years!_\n\n_I really don’t have much money to pay you!_\n\n_Be humane!!!”_\n\n_“The best I can do is to bargain”_\n\n\n-----\n\n_“Please send me the key._\n\n_Anyway, I can’t pay, neither with bargain, nor without it. Even one thousand rubles is a big_\n_sum for me._\n\n_The case in which I’ll lose all of my personal and work(!) files will not make your life_\n_easier…”_\n\n_“7000 is a minimal cost for you_\n\n_Decide for yourself_\n\n_There is no way to get the key for free”_\n\nBy the end of our correspondence, I managed to get a discount of 50%. Perhaps if I had\ncontinued bargaining, I could have gotten an even bigger discount.\n\n\n-----",
