    "plain_text": "# GozNym Banking Malware: Gang Busted, But Is That The End?\n\n**[sentinelone.com/blog/goznym-banking-malware-gang-busted/](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/goznym-banking-malware-gang-busted/)**\n\nMay 20, 2019\n\nAmid all last week’s [cybersecurity bad news, there was at least one bright spot for the](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/what-microsoft-just-announced-and-why-it-is-so-important/)\nsecurity world to cheer about. On Thursday, Europol announced that they had dismantled the\ncriminal network behind the GozNym banking malware, which has been aggressively\n[targeting businesses and financial institutions in multiple countries. According to Europol, a](https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/goznym-malware-cybercriminal-network-dismantled-in-international-operation)\n[botnet of some 41000 infected computers was using the GozNym malware to siphon up to](https://www.sentinelone.com/cybersecurity-101/botnets/)\n$100 million from its unsuspecting victims.\n\n\n-----\n\n## What is GozNym Malware?\n\n\n-----\n\nGozNym is a hybrid creation specifically coded to, among other things, avoid detection by\n[legacy AV solutions. The gang had combined the Nymaim malware, a first stage loader with](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/5-common-cyber-security-threats-that-bypass-legacy-av/)\npersistence capabilities, with a second-stage infection containing a version of the Gozi ISFB\nbanking trojan, hence the name GozNym.\n\nNymaim has been around for several years but is notable for its ability to avoid security\n[solutions. As previous researchers have revealed, Nymaim checks for running processes](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/nymaim-config-decoded)\nthat belong to certain AV vendor products.\n\n[Although Nymaim was initially used as a dropper for ransomware, it has become increasingly](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/how-does-ransomware-work/)\nassociated with banking malware since around 2015. It was first combined with Gozi as a\nsecond stage payload in early 2016.\n\n[The Gozi banking trojan, aka Ursnif, is an established malware whose source code has been](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/ursnif-polymorphic-delivery-mechanism-explained/)\n[leaked and analyzed several times over the past few years. Leaks allowed the GozNym](https://www.vkremez.com/2018/08/lets-learn-in-depth-reversing-of-recent.html)\n[gang to cherrypick its most useful methodologies. Among those are the abilities to install an](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2016/09/goznym.html)\nMBR (Master Boot Record) rootkit and to generate a custom list of C2 servers using its own\nDomain Generation Algorithms (DGA).\n\nHowever, the primary engine underlying GozNym and related variants such as Dreambot,\nIAP and PowerSniff, is ISFB – a dynamic link library (DLL) designed to analyze and modify\nHTTP traffic on the victim’s computer. It is this component that allows the criminals to hijack\nthe user’s banking credentials through its ability to inject and manipulate a browser’s web\nsessions.\n\nGozi ISFB also [supports various plugins that are traded in underground marketplaces and](https://lokalhost.pl/txt/isfb_still.live.and.licking.Botconf2016.pdf)\nwhich can give it a variety of capabilities, such as stealing emails and passwords.\n\n## The GozNym Criminal Network\n\nThe criminal network behind GozNym was a sophisticated setup, Europol reported, spanning\nfour East European countries and orchestrated through underground, Russian-speaking\nonline criminal forums.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Spammers were employed to create and send hundreds of thousands of phishing emails.](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/what-is-a-phishing-scam/)\nThe emails, designed to look like legitimate business correspondence, encouraged the\nrecipient to click on a malicious link or file attachment. Word.doc attachments with encrypted\nVBA macros are, surprisingly, still an effective technique. If the social engineering trick\nworked, the victim’s machine was redirected to a server that dropped the GozNym malware.\n\nThe purpose of the GozNym malware is to capture victims’ banking login credentials and\ndeliver these to the gang, who would then use the captured credentials to fraudulently gain\naccess to victims’ accounts. The stolen funds were then laundered through U.S and other\nforeign bank accounts controlled by the criminals.\n\n[The gang’s complex operation required many layers of enterprising criminals tasked with](https://www.europol.europa.eu/publications-documents/goznym-criminal-network-how-it-worked)\ndifferent duties.\n\nThe first stage primarily involved two people, the leader of the criminal network and a\ndeveloper. Other cybercriminals were recruited to provide specialist services and skills,\nincluding coding. In order to cover their tracks, crypters were used to improve the malware’s\nability to evade AV solutions. The gang also employed spammers to create mass email\nphishing campaigns to lure in potential victims. Another layer in the network involved the\nAvalanche hosting service, which was used to register malicious domains and host the\nmalware. The web of criminals involved spread further to include account takeover\n\n\n-----\n\nspecialists who managed the victims hijacked online banking accounts and initiated\nelectronic transfers of funds. Finally, money launderers were used to provide bank accounts\nthat received the victims’ stolen funds.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n## Is That the End of GozNym?\n\nWhile the good news is that the actors behind GozNym have been unmasked, unfortunately\nthey have not all been apprehended. The source code and methodology behind GozNym’s\ncreation is at least partially available (it is not currently known if the Nymaim source code has\nbeen leaked), and there is clear evidence of cybercrime-as-a-service being an active\nbusiness model on the Dark Net and elsewhere.\n\nDefenders should realize also that GozNym is only part of a family of related malwares that\n[have a long history and complex relationships:](https://lokalhost.pl/gozi_tree.txt)\n\n\n-----\n\n￼It has also been [suggested that the powerful ISFB module that underlies this form of banking](https://lokalhost.pl/txt/isfbv3.pdf)\ntrojan may be maintained and developed by at least three independent groups.\n\nGiven all that we know, it’s reasonably likely that GozNym or something similar will be seen\nactive in the wild again before long.\n\n## How to Protect Against GozNym\n\nSentinelOne customers are already protected against GozNym malware as demonstrated in\nthis video. As soon as the malware attempts to execute, the SentinelOne agent on the\nendpoint detects the threat and quarantines the malicious file, leaving the device in a clean,\nuninfected state.\n\n[If you are not already protected by SentinelOne, try a free demo to see how our easy-to-use,](https://www.sentinelone.com/request-demo/)\nautonomous endpoint solution can protect your business.\n\n\n-----",
