Unknown threat group using Hades ransomware to turn up the heat on their victims\n\n**[accenture.com/us-en/blogs/cyber-defense/unknown-threat-group-using-hades-ransomware](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/blogs/cyber-defense/unknown-threat-group-using-hades-ransomware)**\n\n[Cyber Defense](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/blogs/cyber-defense)\n\nMarch 26, 2021\n\nShare\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nAn unknown financially motivated threat group is using the self-proclaimed Hades\nransomware variant in cybercrime operations that have impacted at least three (3)\nvictims since December 2020.\nKnown victims include a large US transportation & logistics organization, a large US\nconsumer products organization, and a global manufacturing organization.\nTactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTP) employed to compromise a victim network,\nescalate privileges, move laterally, evade defenses, exfiltrate data and deploy Hades\n[ransomware are relatively consistent with other well-known ransomware operators,](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/security/cyber-threatscape-report)\nusing a combination of commodity tooling and various living-off-the-land techniques.\n\n\n-----\n\nOf note, we observed significant effort by the threat group to disable or bypass\nendpoint defenses, including Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tooling, using\nboth custom tooling and hands on keys approaches.\nWe assess with moderate confidence that the group's operations have just begun,\nand that Hades activity will likely continue to proliferate into the foreseeable future,\nimpacting additional victims.\n\nThe information outlined in this blog is based on collection from CIFR incident response\nengagements, Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT), and various media reports. This is a\ndeveloping story; additional details will be released to the community when available.\n\nSummary & timeline\n\nAn unknown threat group is using the self-proclaimed Hades ransomware in cybercrime\noperations that have impacted at least three (3) victims. Based on collection sources, the\n[threat group has been in operations since at least December 2020 and has continued to](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/trucking-giant-forward-air-hit-by-new-hades-ransomware-gang/)\ntarget victims through March 2021. Accenture Security also analyzed the group's activities\nin the context of attribution, victimology, and TTPs employed according to OSINT and\nincident response data. Accenture Security assesses the group's operations have just\nbegun, and their activity will likely continue to proliferate into the foreseeable future,\ntargeting additional victims.\n\nVictimology\n\nWe are currently aware of 3 victims, all of which are large multi-national organizations with\nannual revenues exceeding $1 billion USD. The profiles of the three (3) known victims are a\nstrong indicator of Big Game Hunting, with target selection and deployment methods aimed\ntoward high-value payouts. This also may explain the relatively low number of known\n[victims since Hades was first identified publicly in December 2020.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/trucking-giant-forward-air-hit-by-new-hades-ransomware-gang/)\n\nIndustries impacted so far based on known victimology include:\n\n1. Transportation & Logistics\n2. Consumer Products\n3. Manufacturing & Distribution\n\nFurthermore, we identified additional Tor hidden services and clearnet URLs via various\n[open-source reporting pertaining to the Hades ransomware samples. For all analyzed](https://twitter.com/demonslay335/status/1339324224029274118)\nsamples, the ransom notes identified instruct the victim to install Tor browser and visit the\nspecified page. The Tor pages differ only in the Victim ID that is provided, indicating each\nTor address may be uniquely generated for each victim. Accenture Security identified a total\nof six (6) of these addresses, indicating there could be three (3) additional victims we are\nunaware of at this time.\n\n<<< Start >>>\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1—Hades ransomware tor site\n\n<<< End >>>\n\nHades ransomware operations\n\nAt this time, it is unclear if the unknown threat group operates under an affiliate model, or if\nHades is distributed by a single group. Under an affiliate model, developers’ partner with\naffiliates who are responsible for various tasks or stages of the operation lifecycle, such as\ndistributing the malware, providing initial access to organizations or even target selection\nand reconnaissance. However, based on intrusion data from incident response\nengagements, the operators tailor their tactics and tooling to carefully selected targets and\nrun a more “hands on keyboard” operation to inflict maximum damage and higher payouts.\n\nIn addition, we identified similarities in the Hades ransom notes to those that have been\nused by REvil ransomware operators, where portions of the ransom notes observed contain\nidentical wording. The differentiating factors in the ransom notes are the operators’ contact\ninformation and the formatting of the ransom notes. While the ransom notes are similar, we\ndo not have any evidence to suggest the threat groups or operations have any overlap at\nthis time.\n\n<<< Start >>>\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2—Hades ransomware ransome note\n\n<<< End >>>\n\nThe below provides a high-level summary based on analysis of Hades ransomware\nsamples:\n\nCreates a copy of itself at the path %appdata%\\[created folder]\\[create file with no\nextension] with a variable folder and file name.\nRelaunches itself using the command line parameter go\nDeletes itself and its copy using the following command structure where %s is the\npath to file executable: “cmd /c waitfor /t %u pause /d y & attrib -h \"%s\" & del \"%s\" &\nrd \"%s\"\nUnpacks an executable in memory and executes it (i.e., the unpacked Hades sample)\nDeletes shadow copies through “vssadmin.exe Delete Shadows /All /Quiet”\nTraverses local directories and network shares looking for files to encrypt and skips\nfiles with specified extensions or strings\nAdds an extension (different for each sample) to files that it encrypts and drops a\nransom note with file name “HOW-TO-DECRYPT-[extension].txt”\nAs previously noted, the ransom note includes a URL to a TOR site for ransom\ninstructions\n\nIn addition, based on significant code overlap found in Hades samples with other known\nvariants, [Crowdstrike assesses that the new variant is a successor to WastedLocker](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/hades-ransomware-successor-to-indrik-spiders-wastedlocker/)\nransomware and possibly linked to Evil Corp operations.\n\nCompromise activity & detection opportunities\n\n_Initial access_\n\nThe primary method for initial access into the victim’s network appears to be internet-facing\nsystems via Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) or Virtual Private Network (VPN) using\nlegitimate credentials.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Persistence_\nThe use of legitimate credentials, service creation, and distribution of Command and\n[Control (C2) beacons across victim environments through the use of Cobalt Strike and](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0154/)\n[Empire, so far appear to be the predominant approach used by the unknown threat group to](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0363/)\nfurther their foothold and maintain persistence. In addition, the threat actors operated out of\nthe root of C:\\ProgramData where several executables tied to the intrusion set were found.\n\n_Privilege escalation_\nCredential harvesting and subsequent privilege escalation achieved through the use of\ntooling and manual enumeration of credentials.\n\n_Defense evasion_\nImpeding defenses was achieved through use of domain administrator credentials and\nincludes the following:\n\nBatch script that leverages wevtutil.exe to clear event logs on impacted hosts\nDisabling Anti-Virus (AV) products on endpoints, as well as manually disabling\nEndpoint Detection & Response (EDR) tools and prevention policies through the user\ninterface\nModification of Group Policy Object (GPO) to disable windows audit logging\n\n_Discovery_\nObserved multiple methods for internal network reconnaissance, such as various\nreconnaissance scripts and tools used to collect network, host, and domain information.\n\n_Lateral Movement_\nLateral movement accomplished via compromised accounts obtained during internal\nreconnaissance activities. Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) was also leveraged for host-tohost lateral movement.\n\n_Exfiltration & impact_\nPrior to deploying Hades ransomware, the unknown threat group has employed the 7zip\nutility to archive data that was then staged and exfiltrated to an attacker-controlled server\nhosted in Mega[.]nz cloud infrastructure, leveraging the MEGAsync utility. In addition to data\ntheft, actors deploy Hades ransomware to encrypt files identified on the victim network.\nHades operators leverage this approach for \"double-extortion\" tactics.\n\nMitigation recommendations\n\nEnsure robust crisis management, incident response and disaster recovery plans are\nin place in the event of a data breach or ransomware incident.\nConsider developing continuity of operations plans (COOP) that account for\nransomware or wiper attacks that can impact business operations.\n\n\n-----\n\nMaintain best practices against ransomware, such as patching, firewalling infection\nvectors, updating anti-virus software, employing a resilient backup strategy (e.g., 3-21, 3-2-2, etc.), implementing strict network egress policies, and using application\nwhitelisting where feasible.\nInstall and update anti-virus software to proactively identify and protect against\nmalware.\nConsider deploying Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) across the environment,\ntargeting at least 90% endpoint and workload visibility.\nIn addition to a robust password policy, use MFA where possible for authenticating\ncorporate accounts to include remote access mechanisms (e.g., VPNs)\nSecure Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connections with complex passwords, virtual\nprivate networks (VPNs) and Network Level Authentication (NLA), if RDP connections\nmust be used.\nPatch infrastructure to the highest available level, as threat actors are often better\nable to exploit older systems with existing vulnerabilities.\nEncrypt data-at-rest where possible and protect decryption keys and technology.\nDo not store credentials in files and scripts on shared locations\nWhere possible, deny caching of credentials in memory (e.g., Credential Guard)\nTrain users of all systems to positively identify and safely handle e-mails that could be\npart of a phishing campaign.\n\n[MITRE ATT&CK techniques observed](https://attack.mitre.org/)\n\n**Tactic** **Technique**\n\nInitial access T1133: External Remote Services\nT1078: Valid Accounts\n\nExecution T1059: Command and Scripting Interpreter\nT1086: PowerShell\nT1035: Service Execution\n\nPersistence T1078: Valid Accounts\nT1050: New Service\n\nPrivilege escalation T1055: Process Injection\nT1078: Valid Accounts\n\nDefense evasion T1078: Valid Accounts\nT1036: Masquerading\nT1027: Obfuscated Files or Information\nT1070: Indicator Removal on a Host\nT1562: Impair Defenses\n\nCredential access T1110: Brute Force\nT1003: Credential Dumping\n\n\n-----\n\nDiscovery T1083: File and Directory Discovery\nT1082: System Information Discovery\nT1087: Account Discovery\nT1482: Domain Trust Discovery\nT1135: Network Share Discovery\nT1069: Permission Groups Discovery\nT1018: Remote System Discovery\nT1016: System Network Configuration Discovery\n\nLateral movement T1076: Remote Desktop Protocol\nT1028: Windows Remote Management\n\nCollection T1005: Data from Local System\nT1039: Data from Network Shared Drive\n\nCommand & control T1043: Commonly Used Port\nT1105: Remote File Copy\nT1071: Standard Application Layer Protocol\n\nExfiltration T1002: Data Compressed\nT1048: Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol\n\nImpact T1486: Data Encrypted for Impact\nT1489: Service Stop\n\nIndicators and detections\n\nWe are publishing indicators to help organizations identify both the Unknown Threat\nGroup’s TTPs and the Hades Ransomware variant itself.
