We share new findings of APT-C-36’s ongoing spam campaign\ntargeting South American entities.\n\nBy: Jaromir Horejsi, Daniel Lunghi\nSeptember 13, 2021\nRead time: 5 min (1474 words)\n\n[In 2019, we wrote a blog entry about a threat actor, likely based in Colombia, targeting](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/spam-campaign-targets-colombian-entities-with-custom-proyecto-rat-email-service-yopmail-for-cc/)\nentities in Colombia and other South American countries with spam emails. This threat\nactor is sometimes referred to as APT-C-36 or Blind Eagle. Since then, we have\ncontinued tracking this threat actor. In this blog entry, we share our new findings about\nAPT-C-36’s ongoing spam campaign during that monitoring phase.\n\nAPT-C-36 has been known to send phishing emails to various entities in South America\nusing publicly available remote access tools (RATs). Over time, the threat actor switches\nfrom one RAT to another. In the past, we have observed that APT-C-36 makes use of\nRATs such as:\n\n[njRAT](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.njrat)\n[Imminent Monitor](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.imminent_monitor_rat)\n[A custom modified ProyectoRAT](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/spam-campaign-targets-colombian-entities-with-custom-proyecto-rat-email-service-yopmail-for-cc/)\n[Warzone RAT](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.ave_maria)\n[Async RAT](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.asyncrat)\n[Lime RAT](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.limerat)\n[Remcos RAT](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.remcos)\n[BitRAT](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.bit_rat)\n\n## The delivery emails\n\nAPT-C-36 utilizes different ruses for their targets: Many of the fraudulent emails\nimpersonate Colombia’s national directorate of taxes and customs, Dirección de\n_Impuestos y Aduanas Nacionales (DIAN), a lure that the threat actor has used before._\nSuch emails claim that a “seizure order to bank account has been issued,” further details\nare contained in the email attachment, and that the information is protected with\npassword “dian” (Figure 1). In English, the attachment means “seizure order.pdf” and\nthe email body translates to the following:\n\n\n-----\n\n_“Subject: we have sent a seizure order to the bank accounts matching your name_\n\n_Dear taxpayer,_\n\n_For your information, our intelligent IT system detected that your income statement at the_\n_Direccion de Impuestos y Aduanas DIAN has 180 days of arrears. For that reason, we will_\n_proceed as stated in the law, article 823 until 843-2._\n\n_We attach the information and your debt with the password : dian\"_\n\nFigure 1. A delivery email impersonating Colombia’s national directorate of taxes and customs\n\nOther fake emails in this campaign claim to contain a photo that would prove that the\nrecipient’s partner is having an affair. In a similar fashion, the recipient is asked to open\nthe email attachment named “attached picture.jpg” and use the password “foto” to view\nits contents (Figure 2). These emails lack proper punctuation and are badly written,\nwhich is a common feature in phishing attempts. In English, the email translates to the\nfollowing:\n\n_“Hi how are you, I hope you're fine. I write this email to you as I don't dare telling you_\n_directly. Everyone knows except you, open your eyes, you are being cheated on and I don't like_\n_how others are laughing about you. I experienced a similar situation, that's why I don't like_\n_someone doing it to another person. You know me well, I prefer not to make trouble. I attached a_\n_picture where they are kissing, I know it's hard to look at, but it is better than to live a_\n_relationship where you believe it is all fine._\n\n_The picture was too big so I compressed it, you need Winzip or Winrar installed. I will write_\n_another email in the following says, I have more things to tell you._\n\n_I uploaded the picture with a password to avoid other people to look at it. The password is:_\n_foto\".”_\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2. A delivery email pretending to share personal photos\n\nThe sender’s email address is either a spoofed address impersonating DIAN, or a\nHotmail.com address impersonating a fake female profile. The originating IP addresses\nalways belong to a VPN provider.\n\n## The delivery documents\n\nThe delivery documents in these phishing emails are either a PDF file or DOCX file\ncontaining a link. We have found samples of these documents impersonating DIAN\n(Figure 3), and others impersonating Google Photos (Figure 4).\n\nFigure 3. An email attachment with a link to a URL shortener\n\n\n-----\n\nHovering over the link will show that the link was generated from a URL shortener. As\ndiscussed in our last blog entry on this threat actor, APT-C-36 uses URL shorteners such\nas cort.as, acortaurl.com and gtly.to. These URL shorteners are capable of geographical\ntargeting, so if a user from a country not targeted by the threat actors clicks on the link,\nthey will be redirected to a legitimate website. The URL shorteners also have the ability\nto detect the major VPN services, in which case, the shortened link leads the users to a\nlegitimate website instead of redirecting them to the malicious link, as illustrated in\nFigures 5 and 6.\n\nHowever, if the location criteria are met,\nthen the user is redirected to a file hosting\nserver and a file is automatically\ndownloaded (Figure 7).\n\nFigure 5. Geographical targeting detects a\nnon-Colombian IP or VPN, so the user is led to\n\nthe real DIAN website\n\nFigure 6. Geographical targeting detects a\nnon-Colombian IP or VPN, so the user is led\n\nto the real Google Photos website\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7. File storage containing a password-protected archive\n\nThe downloaded file is a password-protected archive, the password for which is\nmentioned in the email, the email attachment, or both. These passwords are usually\nsimple, such as “dian,” “foto,” or “1234.”\n\n## Payload\n\nAfter deobfuscating the executable file within the password-protected archive, we are\npresented with a RAT called BitRAT. This RAT is not new, it has been previously\n[analyzed by security researchers.](https://krabsonsecurity.com/2020/08/22/bitrat-the-latest-in-copy-pasted-malware-by-incompetent-developers/)\n\nUpon analyzing the RAT, the most interesting part of this RAT is its configuration\nsettings seen as an encrypted block of data (Figure 8). There are two hexadecimal strings\nwithin the main executable file in BitRAT: the longer string is the encrypted\nconfiguration, the shorter one is the first part of the key.\n\nFigure 8. BitRAT's encrypted configuration\n\n[Unlike most other malware, BitRAT uses the Camellia cipher with an initialization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camellia_(cipher))\nvector (IV) of 0000000000000000.\n\n\n-----\n\nSeveral computational steps are needed to obtain the final key. First, a magic value is\ncomputed from bytes found on fixed addresses, as shown in Figures 9 and 10.\n\nFigure 9. The algorithm to compute for the magic value of BitRAT’s final\n\nkey\n\nFigure 10. The input data to compute for the magic value of BitRAT’s final key\n\nEach byte is transformed using a simple computation formula, as shown below:\n\n**((((value-0x 08)*0x25) %0x7f)+ 0x7f)% 0x7f**\n\nThis formula can be used to compute for the magic value through the following process:\n\n1. For example, using the data from Figures 9 and 10 will result in the string\n\n“78hf326f87”.\n2. This string is appended to the hardcoded string “38325a784d6f5630”, forming the\n\nstring “38325a784d6f563078hf326f87”.\n3. Afterward, a crc32 checksum is computed from “38325a784d6f563078hf326f87”,\n\nresulting in “d8e71d19”.\n4. A value of 0x08 is added to the checksum, which then becomes “d8e71d21”.\n\n5. The MD5 hash is computed from the checksum “d8e71d21”, forming\n\n“b50d97fb1e3d5fc9cc302384f5718714”.\n6. The first half of this MD5 hash, “b50d97fb1e3d5fc9”, is the key for the Camellia\n\ncipher.\n\nThe configuration is decrypted to the following string, as shown in Figure 11, including a\ncommand-and-control (C&C) server and a port.\n\nFigure 11. Decrypted configuration of BitRAT\n\n## Affected regions and industries\n\nThe majority of the targets we discovered were located in Colombia, although some were\nfrom other South American countries such as Ecuador, Spain, and Panama. This is\nconsistent with the use of Spanish in spear-phishing emails.\n\n\n-----\n\nAlthough APT-C-36’s objective remains unclear, we posit that the threat actor carried\nout this campaign for financial gain. The campaign has affected multiple industries,\nprimarily government, financial, and healthcare entities. We have also seen the\ncampaign affect the finance, telecommunications, and energy, oil and gas industries.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOver the course of this investigation, we have found various new tactics, techniques, and\nprocedures (TTPs) used by APT-C-36. Our research shows that they modify their\nmethods frequently, as evidenced by their use of different link shorteners and RATs.\nWhile spear-phishing emails are the initial infection vector for this ongoing campaign,\nthe threat actor is constantly changing their payloads and improving their techniques to\navoid detection, such as their use of geolocation filtering.\n\nAPT-C-36 selects their targets based on location and most likely the financial standing of\nthe email recipient. These, and the prevalence of the emails, lead us to conclude that the\nthreat actor’s ultimate goal is financial gain rather than espionage.\n\n## Security Recommendations\n\nThreat actors like APT-C-36 are constantly seeking new ways to deploy their malware\nand stay one step ahead of their victims’ defenses. To secure their data from spearphishing attempts, companies can benefit from tools such as the Trend Micro™ Smart\n[Protection Suites and Worry-Free™ Business Security solutions, which protect end-](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/small-business.html)\nusers and businesses from these kinds of threats by detecting and blocking malicious\nfiles, spam messages, and malicious URLs. They can also turn to tools like Trend\nMicro™ Email Security, a no-maintenance cloud solution that delivers continuously\nupdated protection to stop spam, malware, spear phishing, ransomware, and advanced\ntargeted attacks before they reach the network. It protects Microsoft Exchange,\nMicrosoft Office 365, Google Apps, and other hosted and on-premises email solutions.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n[You can access the link here for the full list of IOCs.](https://www.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/research/21/i/apt-c-36-updates-its-long-term-spam-campaign-against-south-american-entities-with-commodity-rats/BlindEagleIOCList.txt)\n\n\n-----",
