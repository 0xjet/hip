Economic espionage or military intelligence?\n\nIt was the best of times; it was the worst of times. While Russian advanced persistent threat (APT) activity against the US and other\n\n[international organizations [https://www.threatconnect.com/guccifer-2-0-dnc-hack-fancy-bears/?](https://www.threatconnect.com/guccifer-2-0-dnc-hack-fancy-bears/?utm_campaign=DNC%20Guccifer%202.0%20Fancy%20Bears%20Research&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter)\n\nutm_campaign=DNC%20Guccifer%202.0%20Fancy%20Bears%20Research&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter] has\n\ndominated the headlines recently, Chinese APT actors have been active outside the limelight. In June 2016, Chinese APT actors\n\nwere discovered using a customized implant within the network of a European consumer electronics company that specializes in\n\ndrone technologies and a U.S. subsidiary of a French energy management company that builds infrastructure for the U.S.\n\ngovernment and the Department of Defense. Chinese e�orts against the European consumer drone company appear to be\n\neconomically motivated and represent a deviation from the September 2015 agreement\n\n[[https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/us-china-vow-not-to-engage-in-economic-cyberespionage/2015/09/25/90e74b6a-](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/us-china-vow-not-to-engage-in-economic-cyberespionage/2015/09/25/90e74b6a-63b9-11e5-8e9e-dce8a2a2a679_story.html)\n\n63b9-11e5-8e9e-dce8a2a2a679_story.html] between the U.S. and China to disavow economic espionage. Due to their involvement\n\nwith the U.S. military, it could be argued targeting the energy management company was for military intelligence and not\n\neconomic espionage.\n\nUsing the [Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis, [https://threatconnect.com/blog/diamond-model-threat-intelligence-star-wars/]](https://threatconnect.com/blog/diamond-model-threat-intelligence-star-wars/)\n\nwe will start by walking through the technical axis of the attack where we found malware used by multiple Chinese APTs calling\n\nback to a domain with the same registrant as those used in the 2015 Anthem and OPM breaches. We’ll pivot to the socio-political\n\naxis of the attack, and discuss how the victims �t the targeting pro�le of at least one Chinese APT – although we are unable to\n\nattribute the attack to a speci�c Chinese APT at this time.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Capabilities: HttpBrowser Backdoor\n\nOn June 08, 2016 ThreatConnect identi�ed a malicious executable MD5: 3BEA073FA50B62C561CEDD9619CD8425. This malware is\n\na variant of “HttpBrowser,” a backdoor used by multiple Chinese APTs, including EMISSARY PANDA (aka APT27/TG-3390\n\n[https://www.secureworks.com/research/threat-group-3390-targets-organizations-for-cyberespionage] ) and DYNAMITE PANDA\n\n[[http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/05/unit42-new-wekby-attacks-use-dns-requests-as-command-and-control-](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/05/unit42-new-wekby-attacks-use-dns-requests-as-command-and-control-mechanism/)\n\nmechanism/] (aka APT18/Wekby/TG-0416). Some reports refer to\n\n[https://www.erai.com/CustomUploads/ca/wp/2015_12_wp_operation_iron_tiger.pdf] HttpBrowser as the GTalk trojan or “Token\n\nControl.” According to [TrendMicro [https://www.erai.com/CustomUploads/ca/wp/2015_12_wp_operation_iron_tiger.pdf],](https://www.erai.com/CustomUploads/ca/wp/2015_12_wp_operation_iron_tiger.pdf)\n\nHttpBrowser allows a threat actor to spawn a reverse shell, upload or download �les, and capture keystrokes on a compromised\n\nsystem, similar to other remote administration tools (RATs). Antivirus detection for HttpBrowser is extremely low and typically\n\nbased upon heuristic signatures. The report also indicates HttpBrowser is not available on underground markets.\n\nSeveral variants of the HttpBrowser backdoor exist; however, in this particular sample beaconing network tra�c stands out as the\n\ntelltale “HttpBrowser/1.0” User-Agent string is replaced with “Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.2) Gecko/%lu Firefox/3.0.1”,\n\nwhere %lu is a format modi�er that appends an unsigned long numerical data type to the user-agent string.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware sends system information using the query string “computer=<COMPUTER NAME>&lanip=<LAN IP>&uid=<Unique\n\nID>&os=<OS VERSION>&relay=<RELAY NUMBER>&data=<DATA>”\n\n### Infrastructure: Adobesys[.]com and a familiar registrant\n\nLeveraging ThreatConnect’s WHOIS function, we identi�ed the malware’s hardcoded command and control domain\n\nadobesys[.]com was registered by the Chinese domain reseller and mass registrant, li2384826402[@]yahoo[.]com. This email\n\naddress is infamous for registering domains used in the DEEP PANDA-attributed Anthem [https://www.threatconnect.com/the\n[anthem-hack-all-roads-lead-to-china/] and OPM [https://www.threatconnect.com/opm-breach-analysis-update/] attacks in 2015,](https://www.threatconnect.com/opm-breach-analysis-update/)\n\nand provides additional evidence tying this HttpBrowser activity to Chinese APT actors.\n\nUsing ThreatConnect’s Farsight Passive DNS integration, we can identify the adobesys[.]com domain was hosted at two IP\n\naddresses — 173.231.11[.]24 and 185.92.222[.]81 — while the domain most likely was operational. One other domain,\n\nnewsoft2[.]com, was hosted at the 185.92.222[.]81 IP during the same timeframe as adobesys[.]com. WHOIS information indicates\n\nthat newsoft2[.]com was also registered by a Chinese registrant (omyname@gmail[.]com), and its co-location with the malicious\n\nadobesys[.]com domain suggests that it may be operated by the same actors behind the HttpBrowser activity. Indicators from this\n\nactivity have been shared in incident 20151228A: Chinese HttpBrowser Activity Targeting European Companies\n\n[https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/incident/incident.xhtml?incident=1080388] .\n\n### Victims: Two Targets\n\nWe provided a lead on the malware and adobesys[.]com to a partner, who collected associated network tra�c and worked with us\n\nto analyze the activity. In this case, the activity was targeted against only a few companies. We determined the Chinese actors\n\nused the “HttpBrowser” backdoor variant to target a control systems engineer in product development at a European consumer\n\ndrone company. The tra�c also helped us identify another target: the U.S. subsidiary of a French energy management company\n\nthat has contracts with the U.S. Department of Defense and other U.S. government elements to implement energy management\n\nand SCADA solutions.\n\nBoth organizations were alerted to this activity shortly after it was discovered. At this time, we have no indication what, if any,\n\ndata was stolen from them.\n\n\n-----\n\nPROGRAM [HTTPS://WWW.THREATCONNECT.COM/WP-CONTENT/UPLOADS/THREATCONNECT-WHITEPAPER\n\nFRAGMENTATION.PDF?\nUTM_CAMPAIGN=DNC%20GUCCIFER%202.0%20FANCY%20BEARS%20RESEARCH&UTM_MEDIUM=TALE%20BLOG&UTM_SOURC\n\n### Adversary: Pondering the PANDAs\n\nWhile we cannot state for certain which Chinese APT is behind this activity,\n\n[https://www.erai.com/CustomUploads/ca/wp/2015_12_wp_operation_iron_tiger.pdf] targeting a consumer drone company and\n\nenergy management company is most consistent with previous EMISSARY PANDA targeting. Both EMISSARY and DYNAMITE\n\nPANDA have previously targeted the defense and aerospace industries, among others; however, EMISSARY PANDA is the only one\n\nof the two known to have targeted energy companies.\n\n[https://www.erai.com/CustomUploads/ca/wp/2015_12_wp_operation_iron_tiger.pdf] According to the Secureworks report\n\n[https://www.secureworks.com/research/threat-group-3390-targets-organizations-for-cyberespionage], EMISSARY PANDA\n\ncommonly conducts strategic web compromises (SWCs), also known as watering hole attacks, on websites associated with the\n\ntarget organization’s industry to increase the likelihood of compromising victims with relevant information. EMISSARY PANDA also\n\nuses spearphishing emails to target speci�c victims. At this time we do not know whether SWCs or spearphishing emails were\n\nused to target the victim organizations.\n\n### Socio-Political: Discussing Possible Motivations\n\nThe HttpBrowser sample piqued our interest since the information security community has had a heightened focus on whether or\n\nnot Beijing is abiding by the September 2015 agreement [https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/us-china-vow-not-to-engage\nin-economic-cyberespionage/2015/09/25/90e74b6a-63b9-11e5-8e9e-dce8a2a2a679_story.html] between U.S. and China to\n\ndisavow economic espionage. The U.S. subsidiary of the French energy management company looks like an artful dodge. These\n\ndual use organizations – those that possess signi�cant intellectual property and are also involved with the U.S. government –\n\npresent tempting targets for China that could facilitate a variety of espionage e�orts. However, China could claim such activity\n\nconstitutes military espionage and therefore does not violate the agreement between Presidents Obama and Xi from last\n\nSeptember.\n\nBy contrast, targeting the European civilian drone maker looks like a case of economically motivated espionage. The world’s\n\nlargest and most popular drone manufacturer is China’s DaJiang Innovation Technology (DJI), which currently holds about 70% of\n\n[the commercial drone market share [http://www.popularmechanics.com/�ight/drones/a18486/6-reasons-dji-is-winning-the-drone-](http://www.popularmechanics.com/flight/drones/a18486/6-reasons-dji-is-winning-the-drone-wars/)\n\nwars/] and was valued at over $10 billion in May 2015 [http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2016/02/29/drones-in-2016-4\nnumbers-everyone-should-know.aspx] . The emerging global market for business services using commercial drones was recently\n\nvalued at over $127 billion [http://press.pwc.com/News-releases/global-market-for-commercial-applications-of-drone-technology\nvalued-at-over--127-bn/s/AC04349E-C40D-4767-9F92-A4D219860CD2] due to the growing applicability of drones across industries\n\nincluding agriculture, mapping, and surveillance.\n\nIn this instance, China most likely is seeking to quash any competition posed to DJI’s command of the market. Within the\n\ncommand and control tra�c we were able to identify that a control systems engineer — with probable access to the European\n\n�rm’s proprietary drone intellectual property and technical data — was targeted as a part of this activity, which likely further\n\ndemonstrates the motivation behind the operation. With access to the targeted company’s intellectual property, sensitive\n\ncommunications, and product roadmap, China could provide its favored companies with economic advantages such as:\n\n\n##### \n\n\n**Integrating competitors’ unique or proprietary capabilities: Many commercial drones rely on custom software for capabilities**\n\nsuch as stabilization, tracking, and GPS. Stealing and integrating competitors’ technologies would lessen any advantage that\n\ncompetitors would have over Chinese drones.\n\n\n#####  Preempting competitors’ innovations: Leveraging compromised intellectual property on drone innovations could allow\n\nChinese companies to advance their own product lines beyond what competitors plan to introduce in future products.\n\n\n##### \n\n \n\n\n**Preempting �nancial or pricing moves from competitors: In an industry where price wars and gouging can have a signi�cant**\n\nimpact on the competition, having the inside scoop on how your competitors plan to price their drones can provide an upper\n\nhand in attempting to undercut them and steal market share.\n\n**Understanding competitors’ business and development plans or bid e�orts: Insider information on how competitors plan to**\n\nexpand their business, augment manufacturing, market their product, or bid contracts, can all help Chinese drone companies\n\ngain an advantage over their competitors.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile Chinese cyber-enabled economic espionage may be less pronounced, it almost certainly hasn’t ended and likely has evolved\n\nto help solidify leading market shares. In some ways, solidifying the dominant Chinese �rm in a market feels like the next chapter\n\nin economic espionage. The overarching storyline of China’s economic espionage has been targeting strategic industries and\n\nallowing China to catch up with established champions. Chinese APT e�orts against American Steel manufacturers\n\n[[https://www.fbi.gov/pittsburgh/press-releases/2014/u.s.-charges-�ve-chinese-military-hackers-with-cyber-espionage-against-u.s.-](https://www.fbi.gov/pittsburgh/press-releases/2014/u.s.-charges-five-chinese-military-hackers-with-cyber-espionage-against-u.s.-corporations-and-a-labor-organization-for-commercial-advantage)\n\ncorporations-and-a-labor-organization-for-commercial-advantage] likely facilitated the rise in Chinese world steel production from\n\nabout 15% in 2000 to 50% in 2015 [http://qz.com/699979/how-chinas-overproduction-of-steel-is-damaging-companies-and\ncountries-around-the-world/] .\n\nChina may be attempting to avoid the ire of the U.S. government as it targets organizations that are headquartered elsewhere.\n\nFurthermore, China may also be attempting to be more e�cient as it focuses collection on organizations that meet multiple\n\nintelligence requirements. Targeting such organizations could allow China to explain away their activity as non-economic\n\nespionage, thereby adhering (with their �ngers crossed) to the Rose Garden agreement.\n\n**Categories:** [Blog,](https://www.threatconnect.com/category/blog/) [Featured Article,](https://www.threatconnect.com/category/featured-article/) [Research,](https://www.threatconnect.com/category/blog/blog-research/) [Threat Research](https://www.threatconnect.com/category/threat-research-tcirt/)\n\n#### A B O U T T H E A U T H O R\n\nWith ThreatConnect, security analysts can simultaneously coordinate with incident response, security operations and risk\n\nmanagement teams while aggregating data from trusted communities.
