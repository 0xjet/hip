According to Accellion, this activity involves attackers leveraging four vulnerabilities\n[to target FTA customers.[8] In one incident, an attack on an SLTT organization potentially](https://www.accellion.com/company/press-releases/accellion-provides-update-to-recent-fta-security-incident/)\nincluded the breach of confidential organizational data. In some instances observed, the\nattacker has subsequently extorted money from victim organizations to prevent public\nrelease of information exfiltrated from the Accellion appliance.\n\nThis Joint Cybersecurity Advisory provides indicators of compromise (IOCs) and\nrecommended mitigations for this malicious activity. For a downloadable copy of IOCs, see:\n[AA21-055B.stix and](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/AA21-055B.stix.xml) [MAR-10325064-1.v1.stix.](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/MAR-10325064.r1.v1.WHITE_stix.xml)\n\n[Click herefor a PDF version of this report.](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Joint%20Cybersecurity%20Advisory%20AA21-055A_Exploitation_of_Accellion_FTA.pdf)\n\n## Technical Details\n\nAccellion FTA is a file transfer application that is used to share files. In mid-December 2020,\nAccellion was made aware of a zero-day vulnerability in Accellion FTA and released a patch\non December 23, 2020. Since then, Accellion has identified cyber actors targeting FTA\ncustomers by leveraging the following additional vulnerabilities.\n\n[CVE-2021-27101 – Structured Query Language (SQL) injection via a crafted HOST](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-27101)\nheader (affects FTA 9_12_370 and earlier)\n[CVE-2021-27102 – Operating system command execution via a local web service call](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-27102)\n(affects FTA versions 9_12_411 and earlier)\n[CVE-2021-27103 – Server-side request forgery via a crafted POST request (affects](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-27103)\nFTA 9_12_411 and earlier)\n[CVE-2021-27104 – Operating system command execution via a crafted POST request](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-27104)\n(affects FTA 9_12_370 and earlier)\n\n\n-----\n\nOne of the exploited vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-27101) is an SQL injection vulnerability that\nallows an unauthenticated user to run remote commands on targeted devices. Actors have\nexploited this vulnerability to deploy a webshell on compromised systems. The webshell is\nlocated on the target system in the file `/home/httpd/html/about.html` or\n```\n/home/seos/courier/about.html . The webshell allows the attacker to send commands\n\n```\nto targeted devices, exfiltrate data, and clean up logs. The clean-up functionality of the\nwebshell helps evade detection and analysis during post incident response. The Apache\n```\n/var/opt/cache/rewrite.log file may also contain the following evidence of\n\n```\ncompromise:\n```\n   [.'))union(select(c_value)from(t_global)where(t_global.c_param)=\n   ('w1'))] (1) pass through /courier/document_root.html\n   [.'))union(select(reverse(c_value))from(t_global)where(t_global.c_param)=\n   ('w1'))] (1) pass through /courier/document_root.html\n   ['))union(select(loc_id)from(net1.servers)where(proximity)=(0))] (1)\n   pass through /courier/document_root.html\n\n```\nThese entries are followed shortly by a pass-through request to `sftp_account_edit.php .`\nThe entries are the SQL injection attempt indicating an attempt at exploitation of the HTTP\nheader parameter `HTTP_HOST .`\n\nApache access logging shows successful file listings and file exfiltration:\n\n```\n“GET /courier/about.html?aid=1000 HTTP/1.1” 200 {Response size}\n\n```\n```\n   “GET /courier/about.htmldwn={Encrypted Path}&fn={encrypted file name}\n   HTTP/1.1” 200 {Response size}\n\n```\nWhen the clean-up function is run, it modifies archived Apache access logs\n```\n/var/opt/apache/c1s1-access_log.*.gz and replaces the file contents with the\n\n```\nfollowing string:\n```\n  Binary file (standard input) matches\n\n```\nIn two incidents, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) observed a\nlarge amount of data transferred over port 443 from federal agency IP addresses to\n```\n194.88.104[.]24 . In one incident, the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore observed\n\n```\nmultiple TCP sessions with IP address `45.135.229[.]179 .`\n\nOrganizations are encouraged to investigate the IOCs outlined in this advisory and in AR21055A. If an Accellion FTA appears compromised, organizations can get an indication of the\nexfiltrated files by obtaining a list of file-last-accessed events for the target files of the\nsymlinks located in the /home/seos/apps/1000/ folder over the period of malicious\nactivity. This information is only indicative and may not be a comprehensive identifier of all\nexfiltrated files.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Mitigations\n\nOrganizations with Accellion FTA should:\n\nTemporarily isolate or block internet access to and from systems hosting the software.\nAssess the system for evidence of malicious activity including the IOCs, and obtain a\nsnapshot or forensic disk image of the system for subsequent investigation.\nIf malicious activity is identified, obtain a snapshot or forensic disk image of the system\nfor subsequent investigation, then:\n\nConsider conducting an audit of Accellion FTA user accounts for any\nunauthorized changes, and consider resetting user passwords.\nReset any security tokens on the system, including the “W1” encryption token,\nwhich may have been exposed through SQL injection.\nUpdate Accellion FTA to version FTA_9_12_432 or later.\nEvaluate potential solutions for migration to a supported file-sharing platform after\ncompleting appropriate testing.\n\nAccellion has announced that FTA will reach end-of-life (EOL) on April 30, 2021.\n\n[[9] Replacing software and firmware/hardware before it reaches EOL significantly](https://www.accellion.com/sites/default/files/resources/fta-eol.pdf)\nreduces risks and costs.\n\nAdditional general best practices include:\n\nDeploying automated software update tools to ensure that third-party software on all\nsystems is running the most recent security updates provided by the software vendor.\nOnly using up-to-date and trusted third-party components for the software developed\nby the organization.\nAdding additional security controls to prevent the access from unauthenticated\nsources.\n\n## Resources\n\nFireEye Blog – Cyber Criminals Exploit Accellion FTA for Data Theft and Extortion\n\nhttps://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2021/02/accellion-fta-exploited-fordata-theft-and-extortion.html\nAustralia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States Joint\nAdvisory on Technical Approaches to Uncovering and Remediating Malicious Activity\n\n[https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-245a](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-245a)\nCISA and MS-ISAC’s Ransomware Guide\n\nhttps://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/CISA_MSISAC_Ransomware%20Guide_S508C.pdf\n\n## References\n\n Revisions\n\n\n-----\n\nFebruary 24, 2021: Initial Version\n\nJune 17, 2021: Replaced STIX file to remove an IOC reported as non-malicious.\n\n[This product is provided subject to this Notification and this](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/privacy/notification) [Privacy & Use policy.](https://www.dhs.gov/privacy-policy)\n\n**Please share your thoughts.**\n\n[We recently updated our anonymous product survey; we'd welcome your feedback.](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/CISA-cyber-survey?product=https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa21-055a)\n\n\n-----",
