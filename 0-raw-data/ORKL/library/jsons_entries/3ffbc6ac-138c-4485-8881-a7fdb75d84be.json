All transit services were unaffected by the IT\nproblems.\n\nAfter restoring the payment systems, TransLink issued a statement disclosing that a\nransomware attack caused the IT problems.\n\n\"We are now in a position to confirm that TransLink was the target of a ransomware attack on\nsome of our IT infrastructure. This attack includes communications to TransLink through a\nprinted message,\" TransLink disclosed in a statement.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Egregor ransomware was behind TransLink s attack\n\nGlobal BC reporter Jordan Armstrong tweeted a picture of the ransom note and stated that\nTransLink printers were repeatedly printing ransom notes.\n\nRansom letter that’s been rolling off the printers at [@TransLink.](https://twitter.com/TransLink?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n[Sources tell me, at this point, @TransLink does NOT intend to pay.](https://twitter.com/TransLink?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nBut a cyber security expert we spoke to says this is a sophisticated new type of\n[ransomware attack... and many victims do pay.@GlobalBC](https://twitter.com/GlobalBC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [pic.twitter.com/2tYLy4lZkG](https://t.co/2tYLy4lZkG)\n\n[— Jordan Armstrong (@jarmstrongbc) December 4, 2020](https://twitter.com/jarmstrongbc/status/1334659238019223552?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nFrom the picture of the ransom note, BleepingComputer can confirm that it was the Egregor\nransomware operation behind the attack.\n\nIf you have first-hand information about this or other unreported cyberattacks, you can\n[confidentially contact us on Signal at +16469613731 or on Wire at @lawrenceabrams-bc.](http://10.10.0.46/tel:+16469613731)\n\n[Egregor is also the only ransomware known to run scripts that print bomb ransom notes to](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/egregor-ransomware-print-bombs-printers-with-ransom-notes/)\navailable printers, as described by Armstrong in his tweet. The Egregor gang performed this\n[same tactic during a recent Cencosud cyberattack, where receipt printers began repeatedly](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/retail-giant-cencosud-hit-by-egregor-ransomware-attack-stores-impacted/)\nprinting ransom notes to draw public attention to the attack.\n\nEgregor is a new organized cybercrime operation that partners with affiliates to hack into\nnetworks and deploy their ransomware. As part of this arrangement, affiliates earn 70% of\nransom payments they generate, and the Egregor operators make a 30% revenue share.\n\nThe affiliates who compromise a network are known to steal unencrypted files before\nencrypting devices with the Egregor ransomware. The hackers then use these stolen files as\nfurther leverage by telling victims they will be publicly released if a ransom is not paid.\n\nThis ransomware gang began operating in September 2020 after another ransomware group\nknown as [Maze shut down their operation. Threat actors told BleepingComputer that many of](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/maze-ransomware-shuts-down-operations-denies-creating-cartel/)\nthe affiliates that worked with Maze moved over to Egregor, which allowed the new operation\nto amass many victims quickly.\n\n[These attacks include numerous high-profile companies worldwide, including Kmart,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/kmart-nationwide-retailer-suffers-a-ransomware-attack/)\n[Cencosud,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/retail-giant-cencosud-hit-by-egregor-ransomware-attack-stores-impacted/) [Crytek,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/crytek-hit-by-egregor-ransomware-ubisoft-data-leaked/) [Ubisoft, and](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/crytek-hit-by-egregor-ransomware-ubisoft-data-leaked/) [Barnes and Noble.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/barnes-and-noble-hit-by-egregor-ransomware-strange-data-leaked/)\n\n_Thx to_ _[Jack Zhang for the tip!](https://twitter.com/Jack_Y_Zhang)_\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Costa Rica declares national emergency after Conti ransomware attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/costa-rica-declares-national-emergency-after-conti-ransomware-attacks/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[New Black Basta ransomware springs into action with a dozen breaches](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-black-basta-ransomware-springs-into-action-with-a-dozen-breaches/)\n\n[American Dental Association hit by new Black Basta ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/american-dental-association-hit-by-new-black-basta-ransomware/)\n\n[Wind turbine firm Nordex hit by Conti ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/wind-turbine-firm-nordex-hit-by-conti-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[Hackers use Conti's leaked ransomware to attack Russian companies](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-use-contis-leaked-ransomware-to-attack-russian-companies/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
