Working with U.S. Government partners, DHS, FBI, and DoD identified Trojan malware variants used by the N\ngovernment. This malware variant has been identified as HOTCROISSANT. The U.S. Government refers to malicious cyber activity by the North K\nas HIDDEN COBRA. For more information on HIDDEN COBRA activity, visit https[:]//www[.]us-cert.gov/hiddencobra.\n\nDHS, FBI, and DoD are distributing this MAR to enable network defense and reduce exposure to North Korean government malicious cyber activi\n\nThis MAR includes malware descriptions related to HIDDEN COBRA, suggested response actions and recommended mitigation techniques. Use\nshould flag activity associated with the malware and report the activity to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) or the FBI C\n(CyWatch), and give the activity the highest priority for enhanced mitigation.\n\nThis report looks at a full-featured beaconing implant. This sample performs a custom XOR network encoding and is capable of many features inc\nsystem surveys, file upload/download, process and command execution, and performing screen captures.\n[For a downloadable copy of IOCs, see MAR-10271944-1.v1.stix.](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/publications/MAR-10271944-1.v1.stix.xml)\n\nSubmitted Files (1)\n\n8ee7da59f68c691c9eca1ac70ff03155ed07808c7a66dee49886b51a59e00085 (svchost.exe)\n\nIPs (1)\n\n94.177.123.138\n\n## Findings\n\n**8ee7da59f68c691c9eca1ac70ff03155ed07808c7a66dee49886b51a59e00085**\n\nTags\n\ntrojan\n\nDetails\n\n**Name** svchost.exe\n\n**Size** 117760 bytes\n\n**Type** PE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows\n\n**MD5** 062e9cd9cdcabc928fc6186c3921e945\n\n**SHA1** 566347f8bf30f66aec670d660091fb6bb03a0650\n\n**SHA256** 8ee7da59f68c691c9eca1ac70ff03155ed07808c7a66dee49886b51a59e00085\n\n**SHA512** e16fefb72fb466e31f982ea1d3f5e5754af289dfe7c8e7c2c6859b462b02e8715eaedf271985465931983fe0800f93e2943c715929f73136\n\n**ssdeep** 3072:kRdlGZdOwoyeCJkLURXSOpW1yIR3vbRY7a:y3wMae2W9O+NR3DR0a\n\n**Entropy** 6.282477\n\nAntivirus\n\n**Ahnlab** Trojan/Win32.Agent\n\n**Avira** HEUR/AGEN.1039759\n\n**BitDefender** Gen:Variant.Jaiko.2546\n\n**Emsisoft** Gen:Variant.Jaiko.2546 (B)\n\n**Ikarus** Trojan.Win32.KillAV\n\n\n-----\n\n**VirusBlokAda** BScope.Trojan.Tiggre\n\nYARA Rules\n\nrule CryptographyFunction\n\n{\nmeta:\nauthor = \"CISA trusted 3rd party\"\n\nincident = \"10271944.r1.v1\"\n\ndate =  \"2019-12-25\"\n\ncategory = \"Hidden_Cobra\"\n\nfamily = \"HOTCROISSANT\"\n\nstrings:\n\n$ALGO_crypto_1 = { 8A [1-5] 32 [1-4] 32 [1-4] 32 [1-4] 88 [1-5] 8A [1-4] 32 [1-4] 22 [1-4] 8B [1-5] 8D [3-7] 33 [1-4] 81 [3-7] C1 [1-5] C1 [\n5] 33 [1-4] 22 [1-4] C1 [1-5] 33 [1-4] 32 [1-4] 8B [1-4] 83 [1-5] C1 [1-5] 33 [1-4] C1 [1-5] C1 }\n\ncondition:\n\nuint16(0) == 0x5A4D and any of them\n\n}\n\nssdeep Matches\n\nNo matches found.\n\nPE Metadata\n\n**Compile Date** 2019-07-25 11:38:54-04:00\n\n**Import Hash** 9e7d183f56ad974fbd6c056d20051ef8\n\nPE Sections\n\n**MD5** **Name** **Raw Size** **Entropy**\n\n760c39c49aa3a2cb4ec9f6fd5d4524e6 header 1024 2.537779\n\n8480a50e20d57bcb86fa649691ca9e0c .text 80896 6.619532\n\n36d3f909d39d54fd628e1d66d6acd26e .rdata 18432 5.282847\n\na497350b0c256c943b59382e0a2e884a .data 9216 2.905698\n\n2d5b9737e8cd3def95c4fc6527741f91 .rsrc 1024 2.112640\n\n9b5d24778302d0f050a93778c9cab3ef .reloc 7168 4.675041\n\nPackers/Compilers/Cryptors\n\nMicrosoft Visual C++ ?.?\n\nDescription\n\nThe sample performs dynamic DLL importing and API lookups using LoadLibrary and GetProcAddress on obfuscated strings in an attempt to hide\nnetwork functions.

If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication.\nRestrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unl\nEnforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes.\nExercise caution when opening e-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known.\nEnable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests.\nDisable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers.\nScan for and remove suspicious e-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its \"true file type\" (i.e., the extension matches the file\nMonitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content.\nExercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs, etc.).\nScan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing.\nMaintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs).\n\nAdditional information on malware incident prevention and handling can be found in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Specia\n**\"Guide to Malware Incident Prevention & Handling for Desktops and Laptops\".**\n\n## Contact Information\n\nCISA continuously strives to improve its products and services.
