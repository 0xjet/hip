For example, 1.doc would be encrypted and renamed to\n1.doc.ReadManual.C77BFF8C, as shown in the encrypted folder below.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Mount Locker encrypted files**\nThe ransomware will then register the extension in the Registry so that when you click on\nan encrypted file, it will automatically load the ransom note.\n```\nHKCU\\Software\\Classes\\.C77BFF8C\\shell\\Open\\command\\ @=\"explorer.exe\nRecoveryManual.html\"\n\n```\nThe ransom note is named RecoveryManual.html and contains instructions on how to\naccess the Tor site to communicate with the ransomware operators.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Mount Locker ransom note**\nThe Tor site is simply a chat service, where victims can negotiate the ransom or ask\nquestions.\n\nUnfortunately, the ransomware is secure, and there is no way to recover your files for free.\n\nFor those who wish to receive support related to this ransomware, you can use our\n[dedicated Mount Locker support topic.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/t/729090/mount-locker-ransomware-support-topic-recoverymanualhtml-8-character-hex/)\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Industrial Spy data extortion market gets into the ransomware game](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/industrial-spy-data-extortion-market-gets-into-the-ransomware-game/)\n\n[Quantum ransomware seen deployed in rapid network attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/quantum-ransomware-seen-deployed-in-rapid-network-attacks/)\n\n[Snap-on discloses data breach claimed by Conti ransomware gang](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/snap-on-discloses-data-breach-claimed-by-conti-ransomware-gang/)\n\n[Shutterfly discloses data breach after Conti ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/shutterfly-discloses-data-breach-after-conti-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[Windows 11 KB5014019 breaks Trend Micro ransomware protection](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-11-kb5014019-breaks-trend-micro-ransomware-protection/)\n\n[Data Exfiltration](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/data-exfiltration/)\n[Data Leak](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/data-leak/)\n[Mount Locker](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/mount-locker/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
