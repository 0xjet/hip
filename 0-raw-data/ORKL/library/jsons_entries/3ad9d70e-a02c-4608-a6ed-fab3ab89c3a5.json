The group looks for](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/03/microsoft-chinese-cyberspies-used-4-exchange-server-flaws-to-plunder-emails/)\nattacks on Exchange systems using a combination of active Internet scans and “honeypots”\n— systems left vulnerable to attack so that defenders can study what attackers are doing to\nthe devices and how.\n\n**David Watson, a longtime member and director of the Shadowserver Foundation Europe,**\nsays his group has been keeping a close eye on hundreds of unique variants of backdoors\n(a.k.a. “web shells”) that various cybercrime groups worldwide have been using to\ncommandeer any unpatched Exchange servers. These backdoors give an attacker complete,\nremote control over the Exchange server (including any of the server’s emails).\n\nOn Mar. 26, Shadowserver saw an attempt to install a new type of backdoor in compromised\nExchange Servers, and with each hacked host it installed the backdoor in the same place:\n“/owa/auth/babydraco.aspx.”\n\n\n-----\n\nThe web shell path that was dropped was new to us, said Watson said. We have been\ntesting 367 known web shell paths via scanning of Exchange servers.”\n\nOWA refers to Outlook Web Access, the Web-facing portion of on-premises Exchange\nservers. Shadowserver’s honeypots saw multiple hosts with the Babydraco backdoor doing\nthe same thing: Running a Microsoft Powershell script that fetches the file\n“krebsonsecurity.exe” from the Internet address 159.65.136[.]128. Oddly, none of the several\ndozen antivirus tools available to scan the file at Virustotal.com currently detect it as\nmalicious.\n\nThe Krebsonsecurity file also installs a root certificate, modifies the system registry, and tells\nWindows Defender not to scan the file. Watson said the Krebsonsecurity file will attempt to\nopen up an encrypted connection between the Exchange server and the above-mentioned IP\naddress, and send a small amount of traffic to it each minute.\n\nShadowserver found more than 21,000 Exchange Server systems that had the Babydraco\nbackdoor installed. But Watson said they don’t know how many of those systems also ran\nthe secondary download from the rogue Krebsonsecurity domain.\n\n“Despite the abuse, this is potentially a good opportunity to highlight how\nvulnerable/compromised MS Exchange servers are being exploited in the wild right now, and\nhopefully help get the message out to victims that they need to sign up our free daily network\nreports,” Watson said.\n\nThere are hundreds of thousands of Exchange Server systems worldwide that were\nvulnerable to attack (Microsoft suggests the number is about 400,000), and most of those\nhave been patched over the last few weeks. However, there are still tens of thousands of\n[vulnerable Exchange servers exposed online. On Mar. 25, Shadowserver tweeted that it was](https://twitter.com/Shadowserver/status/1375251582711963648)\ntracking 73,927 unique active webshell paths across 13,803 IP addresses.\n\n\n-----\n\nImage: Shadowserver.org\n\nExchange Server users that haven’t yet patched against the four flaws Microsoft fixed earlier\nthis month can get immediate protection by deploying Microsoft’s “One-Click On-Premises\nMitigation Tool.”\n\nThe motivations of the cybercriminals behind the Krebonsecurity dot top domain are unclear,\nbut the domain itself has a recent association with other cybercrime activity — and with\nharassing this author. I first heard about the domain in December 2020, when a reader told\nme how his entire network had been hijacked by a cryptocurrency mining botnet that called\nhome to it.\n\n“This morning, I noticed a fan making excessive noise on a server in my homelab,” the\nreader said. “I didn’t think much of it at the time, but after a thorough cleaning and test, it still\nwas noisy. After I was done with some work-related things, I checked up on it – and found\nthat a cryptominer had been dropped on my box, pointing to XXX-XXXXX.krebsonsecurity.top’. In all, this has infected all three linux boxes on my network.”\n\nWhat was the subdomain I X’d out of his message? Just my Social Security number. I’d been\ndoxed via DNS.\n\nThis is hardly the first time malware or malcontents have abused my name, likeness and\n[website trademarks as a cybercrime meme, for harassment, or just to besmirch my](https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/memegenerator-600x216.png)\nreputation.
