This information includes the\nIP addresses for Cobalt Strike C2 servers and a 113 MB archive containing numerous tools\n\n\n-----\n\nand training material for conducting ransomware attacks.\n\n**Forum post from disgruntled affiliate**\nThe affiliate said they posted the material as he was only paid $1,500 as part of an attack,\nwhile the rest of the team are making millions and promising big payouts after a victim pays\na ransom.\n\n\"I merge you their ip-address of cobalt servers and type of training materials. 1500 $ yes, of\ncourse, they recruit suckers and divide the money among themselves, and the boys are fed\nwith what they will let them know when the victim pays,\" the affiliate posted to a popular\nRussian-speaking hacking forum.\n\nAttached to the above post are images of Cobalt Strike beacon configurations that contain\nthe IP addresses for command and control servers used by the ransomware gang.\n\nIn a tweet by security researcher Pancak3, it is advised that everyone block those IP\naddresses to prevent attacks from the group.\n\ngo block these\n\n162.244.80.235\n\n85.93.88.165\n\n185.141.63.120\n\n82.118.21.1\n\n[— pancak3 (@pancak3lullz) August 5, 2021](https://twitter.com/pancak3lullz/status/1423324601346629635?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nIn a subsequent post, the affiliate shared an archive containing 111 MB of files, including\nhacking tools, manuals written in Russian, training material, and help documents that are\nallegedly provided to affiliates when performing Conti ransomware attacks.\n\nA security researcher shared a screenshot of this extracted folder with BleepingComputer.\nWe were told it contains a manual on deploying Cobalt Strike, mimikatz to dump NTLM\nhashes, and numerous other text files filled with various commands.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Leaked Conti training materials**\nAdvanced Intel's Vitali Kremez, who had already analyzed the archive, told\nBleepingCompter that the training material matches active Conti cases.\n\n\"We can confirm based on our active cases. This playbook matches the active cases for\nConti as we see right now,\" Kremez told BleepingComputer in a conversation.\n\n\"By and large, it is the holy grail of the pentester operation behind the Conti ransomware\n\"pentester\" team from A-Z. The implications are huge and allow new pentester ransomware\noperators to level up their pentester skills for ransomware step by step.\"\n\n\"The leak also shows the maturity of their ransomware organization and how sophisticated,\nmeticulous and experienced they are while targeting corporations worldwide.\"\n\n\"It also provides a plethora detection opportunities including the group focus on AnyDesk\npersistence and Atera security software agent persistence to survive detections.\"\n\nThis leak illustrates the vulnerability of ransomware-as-a-service operations, as a singly\nunhappy affiliate could lead to the exposure of carefully cultivated information and\nresources used in attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\nRecently the United States government announced that its Rewards for Justice program is\nnow accepting tips on foreign malicious cyberactivity against U.S. critical infrastructure, with\n[a potential $10 million reward for helpful information.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-govt-offers-10-million-reward-for-tips-on-nation-state-hackers/)\n\nAdditionally, rewards through this program may be done anonymously in cryptocurrency,\nwhich could incentivize low-paid affiliates to turn on other cybercriminals.\n\n_Update 8/6/21: A source told BleepingComputer that Conti banned the pentester after_\nlearning he was poaching business away from their operation by promoting a different\nunidentified affiliate program.\n\nAfter being banned, the affiliate leaked Conti's training material and tools as revenge.\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n[The Week in Ransomware - May 20th 2022 - Another one bites the dust](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-week-in-ransomware-may-20th-2022-another-one-bites-the-dust/)\n\n[Conti ransomware shuts down operation, rebrands into smaller units](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/conti-ransomware-shuts-down-operation-rebrands-into-smaller-units/)\n\n[The Week in Ransomware - May 13th 2022 - A National Emergency](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-week-in-ransomware-may-13th-2022-a-national-emergency/)\n\n[Costa Rica declares national emergency after Conti ransomware attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/costa-rica-declares-national-emergency-after-conti-ransomware-attacks/)\n\n[US offers $15 million reward for info on Conti ransomware gang](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-offers-15-million-reward-for-info-on-conti-ransomware-gang/)\n\n[Affiliates](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/affiliates/)\n[Conti](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/conti/)\n[Playbook](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/playbook/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n[Ransomware-as-a-Service](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware-as-a-service/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
