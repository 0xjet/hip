This emphasizes the importance of having\nthe right technologies in place. The automated detection and protection capabilities of the\n[CrowdStrike Falcon platform protect customers from this malware, provide them with visibility](https://www.crowdstrike.com/endpoint-security-products/falcon-platform/)\ninto their environments and allow for intelligent monitoring of cloud resources. Falcon\ncustomers gain insights into overall security posture and the actions required to prevent\npotential security incidents.\n\nFollowing mid-January 2022 incidents involving a series of Ukrainian website defacements\nand the deployment of data-wiping WhisperGate malware, CISA issued guidance on how\ncompanies can maximize resilience against similar incidents\n\n\n-----\n\nTo better understand how WhisperGate malware operates, CrowdStrike Intelligence recently\nperformed a technical analysis of the malicious bootloader and how the destructive wiping\noperation occurs.\n\nThe Falcon platform uses machine learning and behavior-based detections to provide\ncontinuous protection from threats — including data-wiping malware — and deliver real-time\nvisibility across workloads.\n\n## A Primer on Destructive Malware\n\n[Destructive malware includes threats that render compromised systems inoperable by](https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/malware/)\ndeleting or wiping critical data instead of making it inaccessible through encryption.\n\nIn 2017, two destructive [ransomware outbreaks — NotPetya and WannaCry — leveraged](https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/ransomware/)\nthe EternalBlue vulnerability in the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol to quickly spread\nand infect vulnerable systems worldwide.\n\nThe NotPetya ransomware outbreak started in Ukraine, and shortly after security\nresearchers found that a faulty encryption routine made file recovery impossible regardless\nof whether victims paid. The WannaCry ransomware outbreak that followed also made data\nrecovery impossible, as the ransomware could not tie payment to a particular victim\nmachine.\n\nThe recent WhisperGate threat targeting Ukraine features no decryption or data-recovery\nmechanism, and only performs destructive wiping operations on the infected host’s hard\ndrives. While the threat attempts to masquerade as genuine modern ransomware operations,\nit irrevocably corrupts the affected host’s data. The CISA alert urges companies to\nimmediately implement cybersecurity measures to protect their infrastructures.\n\n## Gain Visibility and Stop Threats with the Falcon Platform\n\nThe Falcon platform offers unified visibility, threat detection and continuous monitoring and\ncompliance for any environment, enabling security teams to reduce the time it takes to detect\nand mitigate security risks.\n\nThe Falcon sensor employs behavior-based detections using indicators of attack (IOAs) and\non-sensor and in-the-cloud machine learning to identify and block threats while incorporating\nintelligence derived by continuously monitoring tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs)\nrelated to threats and threat actors.\n\nData-wiping threats, including the recent WhisperGate, perform destructive operations on the\ninfected host’s hard drive, making data unrecoverable. CrowdStrike Intelligence performed\nan analysis on the malicious bootloader, but WhisperGate also uses a downloader to retrieve\n\n\n-----\n\nthe final data-wiping payload. The Falcon platform uses on-sensor machine learning to\ndetect and prevent the downloader before fetching the data-wiping component, as seen in\nthe screenshot below.\n\nFigure 1. Falcon on-sensor machine learning coverage for the WhisperGate downloader component (Click\n\nto enlarge)\n\nThe data-wiping payload reads the file name and adds a random integer at the end of file. It\nthen replaces the 0x100000 bytes of the file with hex 0xcc and renames the file, making the\ndata unrecoverable, as seen in Figure 2.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2. Data-wiping and file-renaming code (Click to enlarge)\n\nThe Falcon platform automatically detects and prevents the final data-wiping payload, using\nmachine learning and behavior-based detection. Figure 3 reveals that the Falcon sensor\nimmediately detects and protects from any data-wiping activity.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3. Falcon machine learning and IOA coverage for the data-wiping payload (Click to enlarge)\n\nBy accurately identifying malicious activity, gaining visibility into suspicious behaviors and\nprioritizing threats, the Falcon platform eliminates noise and reduces alert fatigue, allowing\norganizations to respond faster to potential threat incidents and gain deep visibility of\npotential security blind spots.\n\n## Maximize Resilience\n\nOrganizations that face risk from cyber incidents, including data-wiping threats, are strongly\nencouraged to take appropriate measures to protect their business from any significant\nimpact on their operations.\n\nCISA recommends that organizations take cyber risk and operational resilience seriously and\ntake steps to reduce potential damages, detect intrusions and respond to potential threats.\n\nThe Falcon platform protects customers against sophisticated adversaries and sophisticated\nthreats, accelerating response and offering visibility into the overall security posture of the\norganization. Organizations leveraging the power of the Falcon platform can detect and\nprotect themselves from ransomware, data-wiping malware and other sophisticated threats\nand adversaries.\n\n**Additional Resources**\n\n_Read more about WhisperGate in this CrowdStrike Intelligence blog: Technical_\n_Analysis of the WhisperGate Malicious Bootloader._\n_Learn about the powerful, cloud-native CrowdStrike Falcon® platform by visiting the_\n_product webpage._\n\n\n-----\n\n_[Get a full-featured free trial of CrowdStrike Falcon Prevent™ to see for yourself how](https://go.crowdstrike.com/try-falcon-prevent.html)_\n_true next-gen AV performs against today’s most sophisticated threats._\n\n\n-----",
