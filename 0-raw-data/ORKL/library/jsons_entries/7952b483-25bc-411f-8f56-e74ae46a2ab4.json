While the prevalence of attacks during\nthis unprecedented time has been largely carried out by low-level fraudsters, the more capable threat actors have also used this\ncrisis as an opportunity to hide in plain sight.\n\nOne such example is a campaign that McAfee Advanced Threat Research (ATR) observed as an increase in malicious cyber activity\ntargeting the Aerospace & Defense industry. In this 2020 campaign McAfee ATR discovered a series of malicious documents\ncontaining job postings taken from leading defense contractors to be used as lures, in a very targeted fashion. These malicious\ndocuments were intended to be sent to victims in order to install a data gathering implant. The victimology of these campaigns is\nnot clear at this time, however based on the job descriptions, they appear to be targeting people with skills and experience\nrelating to the content in the lure documents. The campaign appears to be similar to activity reported elsewhere by the industry,\nhowever upon further analysis the implants and lure documents in this campaign are distinctly different [2], thus we can\nconclude this research is part of a different activity set. This campaign is utilizing compromised infrastructure from multiple\nEuropean countries to host its command and control infrastructure and distribute implants to the victims it targets.\n\nThis type of campaign has appeared before in 2017 and 2019 using similar methods with the goal of gathering intelligence\nsurrounding key military and defense technologies [3]. The 2017 campaign also used lure documents with job postings from\nleading defense contractors; this operation was targeting individuals employed by defense contractors used in the lures. Based on\nsome of the insight gained from spear phishing emails, the mission of that campaign was to gather data around certain projects\nbeing developed by their employers.\n\nThe Techniques, Tactics and Procedures (TTPs) of the 2020 activity are very similar to those previous campaigns operating under\nthe same modus operandi that we observed in 2017 and 2019. From our analysis, this appears a continuation of the 2019\ncampaign, given numerous similarities observed. These similarities are present in both the Visual Basic code used to execute the\nimplant and some of the core functionality that exists between the 2019 and 2020 implants.\n\nThus, the indicators from the 2020 campaign point to previous activity from 2017 and 2019 that was previously attributed to the\nthreat actor group known as Hidden Cobra [4]. Hidden Cobra is an umbrella term used to refer to threat groups attributed to\nNorth Korea by the U.S Government [1]. Hidden Cobra consists of threat activity from groups the industry labels as Lazarus,\nKimsuky, KONNI and APT37. The cyber offensive programs attributed to these groups, targeting organizations around the world,\nhave been documented for years. Their goals have ranged from gathering data around military technologies to crypto currency\ntheft from leading exchanges.\n\nOur analysis indicates that one of the purposes of the activity in 2020 was to install data gathering implants on victims’ machines.\nThese DLL implants were intended to gather basic information from the victims’ machines with the purpose of victim\nidentification. The data collected from the target machine could be useful in classifying the value of the target. McAfee ATR\nnoticed several different types of implants were used by the adversary in the 2020 campaigns.\n\nThese campaigns impact the security of South Korea and foreign nations with malicious cyber campaigns. In this blog McAfee\nATR analyzes multiple campaigns conducted in the first part of 2020.\n\nFinally, we see the adversary expanding the false job recruitment campaign to other sectors outside of defense and aerospace,\nsuch as a document masquerading as a finance position for a leading animation studio.\n\nIn this blog we will cover:\n\n## Target of Interest – Defense & Aerospace Campaign\n\nThis is not the first time that we have observed threat actors using the defense and aerospace industry as lures in malicious\ndocuments. In 2017 and 2019, there were efforts to send malicious documents to targets that contained job postings for positions\nat leading defense contractors3\n\nThe objective of these campaigns was to gather information on specific programs and technologies. Like the 2017 campaign, the\n2020 campaign also utilized legitimate job postings from several leading defense and aerospace organizations. In the 2020\ncampaign that McAfee ATR observed, some of the same defense contractors from the 2017 operation were again used as\nlures in malicious documents.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis new activity noted in 2020 uses similar Techniques, Tactics and Procedures (TTPs) to those seen in a 2017 campaign that\ntargeted individuals in the Defense Industrial Base(DIB). The 2017 activity was included in an indictment by the\nUS government and attributed to the Hidden Cobra threat group4\n\n## Attack Overview\n\n Phase One: Initial Contact\n\nThis recent campaign used malicious documents to install malware on the targeted system using a template injection attack. This\ntechnique allows a weaponized document to download an external Word template containing macros that will be executed. This is\na known trick used to bypass static malicious document analysis, as well as detection, as the macros are embedded in the\ndownloaded template.\n\nFurther, these malicious Word documents contained content related to legitimate jobs at these leading defense contractors. All\nthree organizations have active defense contracts of varying size and scope with the US government.\n\nThe timeline for these documents, that were sent to an unknown number of targets, ran between 31 March and 18 May 2020.\n\nDocument creation timeline\n\nMalign documents were the main entry point for introducing malicious code into the victim’s environment. These documents\ncontained job descriptions from defense, aerospace and other sectors as a lure. The objective would be to send these documents\nto a victim’s email with the intention they open, view and ultimately execute the payload.\n\nAs we mentioned, the adversary used a technique called template injection. When a document contains the .docx extension, in our\ncase, it means that we are dealing with the Open Office XML standard. A .docx file is a zip file containing multiple parts. Using the\ntemplate injection technique, the adversary puts a link towards the template file in one of the .XML files, for example the link is in\nsettings.xml.rels while the external oleobject load is in document.xml.rels. The link will load a template file (DOTM) from a\nremote server. This is a clever technique we observe being used by multiple adversaries [5] and is intended to make a document\nappear to be clean initially, only to subsequently load malware. Some of these template files are renamed as JPEG files when\nhosted on a remote server to avoid any suspicion and bypass detection. These template files contain Visual Basic macro code, that\nwill load a DLL implant onto the victim’s system. Current McAfee technologies currently protect against this threat.\n\nWe mentioned earlier that docx files (like xlsx and pptx) are part of the OOXML standard. The document defining this\nstandard[6], describes the syntax and values that can be used as an example. An interesting file to look at is the ‘settings.xml’ file\nthat can be discovered in the ‘Word’ container of the docx zip file. This file contains settings with regards to language, markup\nand more. First, we extracted all the data from the settings.xml files and started to compare. All the documents below contained\nthe same language values:\n\n**w:val=”en-US”**\n\n**w:eastAsia=”ko-KR”**\n\nThe XML file ends with a GUID value that starts with the value “w15”.\n\nExample: w15:val=”{932E534D-8C12-4996-B261-816995D50C69}”/>\n</w:settings>\n\nAccording to the Microsoft documentation, w15 defines the PersistentDocumentId Class. When the object is serialized out as xml,\nits qualified name is w15:docId. The 128-bit GUID is set as an ST_Guid attribute which, according to the Microsoft\ndocumentation, refers to a unique token. The used class generates a GUID for use as the DocID and generates the associated key.\nThe client stores the GUID in that structure and persists in the doc file. If, for example, we would create a document and would\n“Save As”, the w15:docId GUID would persist across to the newly created document. What would that mean for our list above?\nDocuments with the same GUID value need to be placed in chronological order and then we can state the earliest document is the\nroot for the rest, for example:\n\nWhat we can say from above table is that ‘_IFG_536R.docx” was the first document we observed and that later documents with\nthe same docID value were created from the same base document.\n\nTo add to this assertion; in the settings.xml file the value “rsid” (Revision Identifier for Style Definition) can be found. According\nto Microsoft’s documentation: “This element specifies a unique four-digit number which shall be used to determine the editing\n_session in which this style definition was last modified. This value shall follow this following constraint: All document elements_\n_which specify the same rsid* values shall correspond to changes made during the same editing session. An editing session is_\n_defined as the period of editing which takes place between any two subsequent save actions.”_\n\n\n-----\n\nLet s start with the rsid element values from _IFG_536R.docx :\n\nAnd compare with the rsid element values from “*_PMS.docx”:\n\nThe rsid elements are identical for the first four editing sessions for both documents. This indicates that these documents,\nalthough they are now separate, originated from the same document.\n\nDigging into more values and metadata (we are aware they can be manipulated), we created the following overview in\nchronological order based on the creation date:\n\nWhen we zoom in on the DocID “932E534d(..) we read the value of a template file in the XML code: “Single spaced (blank).dotx”\n– this template name seems to be used by multiple “Author” names. The revision number indicates the possible changes in the\ndocument.\n\nNote: the documents in the table with “No DocID” were the “dotm” files containing the macros/payload.\n\nAll files were created with Word 2016 and had both the English and Korean languages installed. This analysis into the metadata\nindicates that there is a high confidence that the malicious documents were created from a common root document.\n\n## Document Templates\n\n\n-----\n\nThere were several documents flagged as non-malicious discovered during our investigation. At first glance they did not seem\nimportant or related at all, but deeper investigation revealed how they were connected. These documents played a role in building\nthe final malicious documents that ultimately got sent to the victims. Further analysis of these documents, based on metadata\ninformation, indicated that they contained relationships to the primary documents created by the adversary.\n\nTwo PDF files (***_SPE_LEOS and ***_HPC_SE) with aerospace & defense industry themed images, created via the Microsoft\nPrint to PDF service, were submitted along with ***_ECS_EPM.docx. The naming convention of these PDF files was very similar\nto the malicious documents used. The name includes abbreviations for positions at the defense contractor much like the malicious\ndocuments. The Microsoft Print to PDF service enables content from a Microsoft Word document be printed to PDF directly. In\nthis case these two PDF files were generated from an original Microsoft Word document with the author ‘HOME’. The author\n‘HOME’ appeared in multiple malicious documents containing job descriptions related to aerospace, defense and the\nentertainment industry. The PDFs were discovered in an archive file indicating that LinkedIn may have been a possible vector\nutilized by the adversaries to target victims. This is a similar vector as to what has been observed in a campaign reported by\nindustry[7], however as mentioned earlier the research covered in this blog is part of a different activity set.\n\nMetadata from PDF file submitted with ***_ECS_EPM.docx in archive with context fake\nLinkedIn\n\n## Visual Basic Macro Code\n\nDigging into the remote template files reveals some additional insight concerning the structure of the macro code. The second\nstage remote document template files contain Visual Basic macro code designed to extract a double base64 encoded DLL implant.\nThe content is all encoded in UserForm1 in the remote DOTM file that is extracted by the macro code.\n\nMacro code (17.dotm) for extracting embedded DLL\n\nFurther, the code will also extract the embedded decoy document (a clean document containing the job description) to display to\nthe victim.\n\nCode (17.dotm) to extract clean decoy document\n\n\n-----\n\nMacro code (******_dds_log.jpg) executed upon auto execution\n\n## Phase Two: Dropping Malicious DLLs\n\nThe adversary used malicious DLL files, delivered through stage 2 malicious documents, to spy on targets. Those malicious\ndocuments were designed to drop DLL implants on the victim’s machine to collect initial intelligence. In this campaign the\nadversary was utilizing patched SQL Lite DLLs to gather basic information from its targets. These DLLs were modified to include\nmalicious code to be executed on the victim’s machine when they’re invoked under certain circumstances. The purpose of these\nDLLs is/was to gather machine information from infected victims that could be used to further identify more interesting targets.\n\nThe first stage document sent to targeted victims contained an embedded link that downloaded the remote document template.\n\nEmbedded link contained within Word/_rels/settings.xml.rels\n\nThe DOTM (Office template filetype) files are responsible for loading the patched DLLs onto the victim’s machine to collect and\ngather data. These DOTM files are created with DLL files encoded directly into the structure of the file. These DOTM files exist on\nremote servers compromised by the adversary; the first stage document contains an embedded link that refers to the location of\nthis file. When the victim opens the document, the remote DOTM file that contains a Visual Basic macro code to load malicious\nDLLs, is loaded. Based on our analysis, these DLLs were first seen on 20 April 2020 and, to our knowledge based on age and\nprevalence data, these implants have been customized for this attack.\n\nThe workflow of the attack can be represented by the following image:\n\nTo identify the malicious DLLs that will load or download the final implant, we extracted from the Office files found in the triage\nphase, the following DLL files:\n\n**SHA256** **Original File name** **Compile Date**\n\nbff4d04caeaf8472283906765df34421d657bd631f5562c902e82a3a0177d114 wsuser.db 4/24/2020\n\nb76b6bbda8703fa801898f843692ec1968e4b0c90dfae9764404c1a54abf650b unknown 4/24/2020\n\n37a3c01bb5eaf7ecbcfbfde1aab848956d782bb84445384c961edebe8d0e9969 onenote.db 4/01/2020\n\n48b8486979973656a15ca902b7bb973ee5cde9a59e2f3da53c86102d48d7dad8 onenote.db 4/01/2020\n\nbff4d04caeaf8472283906765df34421d657bd631f5562c902e82a3a0177d114 wsuser.db 4/24/2020\n\nThese DLL files are patched versions from goodware libraries, like the SQLITE library found in our analysis, and are loaded via a\nVBScript contained within the DOTM files that loads a double Base64 encoded DLL as described in this analysis. The DLL is\nencoded in UserForm1 (contained within the Microsoft Word macro) and the primary macro code is responsible for extracting\nand decoded the DLL implant.\n\n\n-----\n\nDOTM Document Structure\n\nImplant DLLs encoded in UserForm1\n\nFrom our analysis, we could verify how the DLLs used in the third stage were legitimate software with a malicious implant inside\nthat would be enabled every time a specific function was called with a set of parameters.\n\nAnalyzing the sample statically, it was possible to extract the legitimate software used to store the implant, for example, one of the\nDLL files extracted from the DOTM files was a patched SQLITE library. If we compare the original library within the extracted\nDLL, we can spot lot of similarities across the two samples:\n\nLegitimate library to the left, malicious library to the right\n\nAs mentioned, the patched DLL and the original SQLITE library share a lot of code:\n\nBoth DLLs share a lot of code internally\n\nThe first DLL stage needs certain parameters in order to be enabled and launched in the system. The macro code of the Office\nfiles we analyzed, contained part of these parameters:\n\nInformation found in the pcode of the document\n\nThe data found in the VBA macro had the following details:\n\n\n-----\n\n32 bit keys that mimic a Windows SID\n\nThe first parameter belongs to the decryption key used to start the malicious activity.\nThis could be chosen by the author to make the value more realistic\nCampaign ID\n\n## DLL Workflow\n\nThe analysis of the DLL extracted from the ‘docm’ files (the 2nd stage of the infection) revealed the existence of two types of\noperation for these DLLs:\n\n**DLL direct execution:**\n\nThe DLL unpacks a new payload in the system.\n\n**Drive-by DLLs:**\n\nThe DLL downloads a new DLL implant from a remote server delivering an additional DLL payload into the system.\n\nFor both methods, the implant starts collecting the target information and then contacts the command and control (C2) server\n\nWe focused our analysis into the DLLs files that are unpacked into the system.\n\n## Implant Analysis\n\nThe DLL implant will be executed after the user interacts by opening the Office file. As we explained, the p-code of the VBA macro\ncontains parts of the parameters needed to execute the implant into the system.\n\nThe new DLL implant file will be unpacked (depending of the campaign ID) inside a folder inside the AppData folder of the user\nin execution:\n\nC:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Notice\\wsdts.db\n\nThe DLL file, must be launched with 5 different parameters if we want to observe the malicious connection within the C2 domain;\nin our analysis we observed how the DLL was launched with the following command line:\n\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\rundll32.exe “C:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Notice\\wsdts.db”, sqlite3_steps S-6-81-381175432205-060098-6872 0 0 61 1\n\nThe required parameters to launch the malicious implant are:\n\n**Parameter number** **Description**\n\n**1** Decryption key\n\n**2** Unused value, hardcoded in the\nDLL\n\n**3** Unused value, hardcoded in the DLL\n\n**4** Campaign identifier\n\n**5** Unused value, hardcoded in the DLL\n\nAs we explained, the implants are patched SQLITE files and that is why we could find additional functions that are used to launch\nthe malicious implant, executing the binary with certain parameters. It is necessary to use a specific export ‘sqlite3_steps’ plus\nthe parameters mentioned before.\n\nAnalyzing the code statically we could observe that the payload only checks 2 of these 5 parameters but all of them must be\npresent in order to execute the implant:\n\n\n-----\n\nsqlite malicious function\n\n### Phase Three: Network Evasion Techniques\n\nAttackers are always trying to remain undetected in their intrusions which is why it is common to observe techniques such as\nmimicking the same User-Agent that is present in the system, in order to remain under the radar. Using the same User-Agent\nstring from the victim’s web browser configurations, for example, will help avoid network-based detection systems from flagging\noutgoing traffic as suspicious. In this case, we observed how, through the use of the Windows API ObtainUserAgentString, the\nattacker obtained the User-Agent and used the value to connect to the command and control server:\n\nIf the implant cannot detect the User-Agent in the system, it will use the default Mozilla User-Agent instead:\n\nRunning the sample dynamically and intercepting the TLS traffic, we could see the connection to the command and control\nserver:\n\n\n-----\n\nUnfortunately, during our analysis, the C2 was not active which limited our ability for further analysis.\n\nThe data sent to the C2 channel contains the following information:\n\n**Parameter** **Description**\n\n**C2** C2 configured for that campaign\n\n**ned** Campaign identifier\n\n**key 1** AES key used to communicate with the C2\n\n**key 2** AES key used to communicate with the\nC2\n\n**sample identifier** Sample identifier sent to the C2 server\n\n**gl** Size value sent to the C2 server\n\n**hl** Unknown parameter always set to 0\n\nWe could find at least 5 different campaign IDs in our analysis, which suggests that the analysis in this document is merely the tip\nof the iceberg:\n\n**Dotx file** **Campaign ID**\n\n**61.dotm** 0\n\n**17.dotm** 17\n\n**43.dotm** 43\n\n**83878C91171338902E0FE0FB97A8C47A.dotm** 204\n\n********_dds_log** 100\n\n### Phase Four: Persistence\n\nIn our analysis we could observe how the adversary ensures persistence by delivering an LNK file into the startup folder\n\n\n-----\n\nThe value of this persistent LNK file is hardcoded inside every sample:\n\nDynamically, and through the Windows APIs NtCreateFile and NtWriteFile, the LNK is written in the startup folder. The LNK file\ncontains the path to execute the DLL file with the required parameters.\n\n## Additional Lures: Relationship to 2020 Diplomatic and Political Campaign\n\nFurther investigation into the 2020 campaign activity revealed additional links indicating the adversary was using domestic South\nKorean politics as lures. The adversary created several documents in the Korean language using the same techniques as the ones\nseen in the defense industry lures. One notable document, with the title US-ROK Relations and Diplomatic Security in\nboth Korean and English, appeared on 6 April 2020 with the document author JangSY.\n\nUS-ROK Relation and Diplomatic Security\n\nThe document was hosted on the file sharing site\n**_hxxps://web.opendrive.com/api/v1/download/file.json/MzBfMjA1Njc0ODhf?inline=0 and contained an_**\nembedded link referring to a remote DOTM file hosted on another file sharing site (od.lk). The BASE64 coded value\nMzBfMjA1Njc0ODhf is a unique identifier for the user associated with the file sharing platform od.lk.\n\nA related document discovered with the title test.docx indicated that the adversary began testing these documents in early April\n2020. This document contained the same content as the above but was designed to test the downloading of the remote template\nfile by hosting it on a private IP address. The document that utilized pubmaterial.dotm for its remote template also made requests\nto the URL hxxp://saemaeul.mireene.com/skin/visit/basic/.\n\nThis domain (saemaeul.mireene.com) is connected to numerous other\nKorean language malicious documents that also appeared in 2020\nincluding documents related to political or diplomatic relations. One such\ndocument (81249fe1b8869241374966335fd912c3e0e64827) was using the\n21 National Assembly Election as part of the title, potentially indicatingst\nthose interested in politics in South Korea were a target. For example,\nanother document\n(16d421807502a0b2429160e0bd960fa57f37efc4) used the name of\nan individual, director Jae-chun Lee. It also shared the same metadata.\n\nThe original author of these documents was listed as Seong Jin Lee according to the embedded metadata information. However,\nthe last modification author (Robot Karll) used by the adversary during document template creation is unique to this set of\nmalicious documents. Further, these documents contain political lures pertaining to South Korean domestic policy that suggests\nthat the targets of these documents also spoke Korean.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Relationship to 2019 Falsified Job Recruitment Campaign\n\nA short-lived campaign from 2019 using India’s aerospace industry as a lure used what appears to be very similar methods to this\nlatest campaign using the defense industry in 2020. Some of the TTPs from the 2020 campaign match that of the operation in late\n2019. The activity from 2019 has also been attributed to Hidden Cobra by industry reporting.\n\nThe campaign from October 2019 also used aerospace and defense as a lure, using copies of legitimate jobs just like we observed\nwith the 2020 campaign. However, this campaign was isolated to the Indian defense sector and from our knowledge did not\nexpand beyond this. This document also contained a job posting for a leading aeronautics company in India; this company is\nfocused on aerospace and defense systems. This targeting aligns with the 2020 operation and our analysis reveals that the DLLs\nused in this campaign were also modified SQL Lite DLLs.\n\nBased on our analysis, several variants of the implant were created in the October 2019 timeframe, indicating the possibility of\nadditional malicious documents.\n\n**Sha1** **Compile Date** **File Name**\n\nf3847f5de342632f8f9e2901f16b7127472493ae 10/12/2019 MFC_dll.DLL\n\n659c854bbdefe692ee8c52761e7a8c7ee35aa56c 10/12/2019 MFC_dll.DLL\n\n35577959f79966b01f520e2f0283969155b8f8d7 10/12/2019 MFC_dll.DLL\n\n975ae81997e6cd8c8a3901308d33c868f23e638f 10/12/2019 MFC_dll.DLL\n\nOne notable difference with the 2019 campaign is the main malicious document contained the implant payload, unlike the 2020\ncampaign that relied on the Microsoft Office remote template injection technique. Even though the technique is different, we did\nobserve likenesses as we began to dissect the remote template document. There are some key similarities within the VBA code\nembedded in the documents. Below we see the 2019 (left) and 2020 (right) side-by-side comparison of two essential functions,\nthat closely match each other, within the VBA code that extracts/drops/executes the payload.\n\nVBA code of 13c47e19182454efa60890656244ee11c76b4904 (left) and acefc63a2ddbbf24157fc102c6a11d6f27cc777d (right)\n\nThe VBA macro drops the first payload of thumbnail.db at the filepath, which resembles the filepath used in 2020.\n\nThe VB code also passes the decryption key over to the DLL payload, thumbnail.db. Below you can see the code within\nthumbnail.db accepting those parameters.\n\n_Unpacked thumbnail.db bff1d06b9ef381166de55959d73ff93b_\n\nWhat is interesting is the structure in which this information is being passed over. This 2019 sample is identical to what we\ndocumented within the 2020 campaign.\n\nAnother resemblance discovered was the position of the .dll implant existing in the exact same location for both 2019 and 2020\nsamples; “o” field under “UserForms1”.\n\n_“o” field of 13c47e19182454efa60890656244ee11c76b4904_\n\nAll 2020 .dotm IoCs contain the same .dll implant within the “o” field under “UserForms1”, however, to not overwhelm this writeup with separate screenshots, only one sample is depicted below. Here you can see the parallel between both 2019 and 2020 “o”\nsections.\n\n_“o” field of acefc63a2ddbbf24157fc102c6a11d6f27cc777d_\n\nAnother similarity is the encoding of double base64, though in the spirit of competing hypothesis, we did want to note that other\nadversaries may also use this type of encoding. However, when you couple these similarities with the same lure of an Indian\ndefense contractor, the pendulum starts to lean more to one side of a possible common author between both campaigns. This may\nindicate another technique being added to the adversary’s arsenal of attack vectors.\n\n\n-----\n\nOne method to keep the campaign dynamic and more difficult to detect is hosting implant code remotely. There is one\ndisadvantage of embedding an implant within a document sent to a victim; the implant code could be detected before the\ndocument even reaches the victim’s inbox. Hosting it remotely enables the implant to be easily switched out with new capabilities\nwithout running the risk of the document being classified as malicious.\n\n**-HAL-MANAGER.doc UserForm1 with double base64 encoded DLL\n\n\n-----\n\n17.DOTM UserForm1 with double base64 encoded DLL from ******_DSS_SE.docx\n\nAccording to a code similarity analysis, the implant embedded in **-HAL-Manager.doc contains some similarities to the implants\nfrom the 2020 campaign. However, we believe that the implant utilized in the 2019 campaign associated with **-HalManager.doc may be another component. First, besides the evident similarities in the Visual Basic macro code and the method for\nencoding (double base64) there are some functional level similarities. The DLL file is run in a way with similar parameters.\n\nDLL execution code **-Hal-Manager.doc implant\n\n\n-----\n\nDLL execution code 2020 implant\n\n## Campaign Context: Victimology\n\nThe victimology is not exactly known due to the lack of spear phishing emails uncovered; however, we can obtain some insight\nfrom the analysis of telemetry information and lure document context. The lure documents contained job descriptions for\nengineering and project management positions in relationship to active defense contracts. The individuals receiving these\ndocuments in a targeted spear phishing campaign were likely to have an interest in the content within these lure documents, as\nwe have observed in previous campaigns, as well as some knowledge or relationship to the defense industry.\n\n### Infrastructure Insights\n\nOur analysis of the 2019 and 2020 campaigns reveals some interesting insight into the command and control infrastructure\nbehind them, including domains hosted in Italy and the United States. During our investigation we observed a pattern of using\nlegitimate domains to host command and control code. This is beneficial to the adversary as most organizations do not block\ntrusted websites, which allows for the potential bypass of security controls. The adversary took the effort to compromise the\ndomains prior to launching the actual campaign. Further, both 2019 and 2020 job recruitment campaigns shared the same\ncommand and control server hosted at elite4print.com.\n\nThe domain mireene.com with its various sub-domains have been used by Hidden Cobra in 2020. The domains identified to be\nused in various operations in 2020 falling under the domain mireene.com are:\n\nsaemaeul.mireene.com\norblog.mireene.com\nsgmedia.mireene.com\nvnext.mireene.com\nnhpurumy.mireene.com\njmable.mireene.com\njmdesign.mireene.com\nall200.mireene.com\n\nSome of these campaigns use similar methods as the 2020 defense industry campaign:\n\nMalicious document with the title European External Action Service [8]\n\n\n-----\n\nDocument with Korean language title 비건미국무부부장관서신doc (U.S. Department of State Secretary of State\nCorrespondence 20200302.doc).\n\n## Techniques, Tactics and Procedures (TTPS)\n\nThe TTPs of this campaign align with those of previous Hidden Cobra operations from 2017 using the same defense contractors as\nlures. The 2017 campaign also utilized malicious Microsoft Word documents containing job postings relating to certain\ntechnologies such as job descriptions for engineering and project management positions involving aerospace and military\nsurveillance programs. These job descriptions are legitimate and taken directly from the defense contractor’s website. The\nexploitation method used in this campaign relies upon a remote Office template injection method, a technique that we have seen\nstate actors use recently.\n\nHowever, it is not uncommon to use tools such as EvilClippy to manipulate the behavior of Microsoft Office documents. For\nexample, threat actors can use pre-built kits to manipulate clean documents and embed malicious elements; this saves time and\neffort. This method will generate a consistent format that can be used throughout campaigns. As a result, we have observed a\nconsistency with how some of the malicious elements are embedded into the documents (i.e. double base64 encoded payload).\nFurther mapping these techniques across the MITRE ATT&CK framework enables us to visualize different techniques the\nadversary used to exploit their victims.\n\nMITRE ATT&CK mapping for malicious documents\n\nThese Microsoft Office templates are hosted on a command and control server and the downloaded link is embedded in the first\nstage malicious document.\n\nThe job postings from these lure documents are positions for work with specific US defense programs and groups:\n\nF-22 Fighter Jet Program\nDefense, Space and Security (DSS)\nPhotovoltaics for space solar cells\nAeronautics Integrated Fighter Group\nMilitary aircraft modernization programs\n\nLike previous operations, the adversary is using these lures to target individuals, likely posing as a recruiter or someone involved\nin recruitment. Some of the job postings we have observed:\n\nSenior Design Engineer\nSystem Engineer\n\nProfessional networks such as LinkedIn could be a place used to deliver these types of job descriptions.\n\n## Defensive Architecture Recommendations\n\nDefeating the tactics, techniques and procedures utilized in this campaign requires a defense in depth security architecture that\ncan prevent or detect the attack in the early stages. The key controls in this case would include the following:\n\n1. **Threat Intelligence Research and Response Program. Its critical to keep up with the latest Adversary Campaigns**\n\ntargeting your specific vertical. A robust threat response process can then ensure that controls are adaptable to the TTPs\nand, in this case, create heightened awareness\n2. **Security Awareness and Readiness Program. The attackers leveraged spear-phishing with well-crafted lures that**\n\nwould be very difficult to detect initially by protective technology. Well-trained and ready users, informed with the latest\nthreat intelligence on adversary activity, are the first line of defense.\n3. **End User Device Security. Adaptable endpoint security is critical to stopping this type of attack early, especially for users**\n\nworking from home and not behind the enterprise web proxy or other layered defensive capability. Stopping or detecting the\nfirst two stages of infection requires an endpoint security capability of identifying file-less malware, particularly malicious\nOffice documents and persistence techniques that leverage start-up folder modification.\n4. **Web Proxy. A secure web gateway is an essential part of enterprise security architecture and, in this scenario, can restrict**\n\naccess to malicious web sites and block access to the command and control sites.\n5. **Sec Ops – Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) can be used to detect techniques most likely in stages 1, 2 or 4.**\n\nAdditionally, EDR can be used to search for the initial documents and other indicators provided through threat analysis.\n\nFor further information on how McAfee Endpoint Protection and EDR can prevent or detect some of the techniques used in this\ncampaign, especially use of malicious Office documents, please refer to these previous blogs and webinar:\n\n[https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/ens-10-7-rolls-back-the-curtain-on-ransomware/](https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/ens-10-7-rolls-back-the-curtain-on-ransomware/)\nhttps://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/how-to-use-mcafee-atp-to-protect-against-emotet-lemonduck-andpowerminer/\n[https://www mcafee com/enterprise/en us/forms/gated form html?docID=video 6157567326001](https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/forms/gated-form.html?docID=video-6157567326001)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n**SHA256** **File Name**\n\n322aa22163954ff3ff017014e357b756942a2a762f1c55455c83fd594e844fdd ********_DSS_SE.docx**\n\na3eca35d14b0e020444186a5faaba5997994a47af08580521f808b1bb83d6063 ********_PMS.docx**\n\nd1e2a9367338d185ef477acc4d91ad45f5e6a7d11936c3eb4be463ae0b119185 *****_JD_2020.docx**\n\necbe46ca324096fd5e35729f39fa3bda9226bbefd6286d53e61b1be56a36de5b *****_2020_JD_SDE.docx**\n\n40fbac7a241bea412734134394ca81c0090698cf0689f2b67c54aa66b7e04670 **83878C91171338902E0FE0FB97A8C47A.dotm**\n\n6a3446b8a47f0ab4f536015218b22653fff8b18c595fbc5b0c09d857eba7c7a1 ********_AERO_GS.docx**\n\ndf5536c254a5d9ac626dbff7525de8301729807433d377db807ce3d8bc7c3ffe ****_IFG_536R.docx**\n\n1b0c82e71a53300c969da61b085c8ce623202722cf3fa2d79160dac16642303f **43.dotm**\n\nd7ef8935437d61c975feb2bd826d018373df099047c33ad7305585774a272625 **17.dotm**\n\n49724ee7a6baf421ac5a2a3c93d32e796e2a33d7d75bbfc02239fc9f4e3a41e0 **Senior_Design_Engineer.docx**\n\n66e5371c3da7dc9a80fb4c0fabfa23a30d82650c434eec86a95b6e239eccab88 **61.dotm**\n\n7933716892e0d6053057f5f2df0ccadf5b06dc739fea79ee533dd0cec98ca971 ********_spectrolab.docx**\n\n43b6b0af744124da5147aba81a98bc7188718d5d205acf929affab016407d592 *****_ECS_EPM.docx**\n\n70f66e3131cfbda4d2b82ce9325fed79e1b3c7186bdbb5478f8cbd49b965a120 ********_dds_log.jpg**\n\nadcdbec0b92da0a39377f5ab95ffe9b6da9682faaa210abcaaa5bd51c827a9e1 **21대** **국회의원** **선거** **관련.docx**\n\ndbbdcc944c4bf4baea92d1c1108e055a7ba119e97ed97f7459278f1491721d02 **외교문서** **관련(이재춘국장).docx**\n\n**URLs**\n\nhxxps://www.anca-aste.it/uploads/form/02E319AF73A33547343B71D5CB1064BC.dotm\n\nhxxp://www.elite4print.com/admin/order/batchPdfs.asp\n\nhxxps://www.sanlorenzoyacht.com/newsl/uploads/docs/43.dotm\n\nhxxps://www.astedams.it/uploads/template/17.dotm\n\nhxxps://www.sanlorenzoyacht.com/newsl/uploads/docs/1.dotm\n\nhxxps://www.anca-aste.it/uploads/form/******_jd_t034519.jpg\n\nhxxp://saemaeul.mireene.com/skin/board/basic/bin\n\nhxxp://saemaeul.mireene.com/skin/visit/basic/log\n\nhxxps://web.opendrive.com/api/v1/download/file.json/MzBfMjA1Njc0ODhf?inline=0\n\nhxxps://od.lk/d/MzBfMjA1Njc0ODdf/pubmaterial.dotm\n\nhxxps://www.ne-ba.org/files/gallery/images/83878C91171338902E0FE0FB97A8C47A.dotm\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn summary, ATR has been tracking a targeted campaign focusing on the aerospace and defense industries using false job\ndescriptions. This campaign looks very similar, based on shared TTPs, with a campaign that occurred in 2017 that also targeted\nsome of the same industry. This campaign began early April 2020 with the latest activity in mid-June. The campaign’s objective is\nto collect information from individuals connected to the industries in the job descriptions.\n\nAdditionally, our forensic research into the malicious documents show they were created by the same adversary, using Korean\nand English language systems. Further, discovery of legitimate template files used to build these documents also sheds light on\nsome of the initial research put into the development of this campaign. While McAfee ATR has observed these techniques before,\nin previous campaigns in 2017 and 2019 using the same TTPs, we can conclude there has been an increase in activity in 2020.\n\nMcAfee detects these threats as\n\n\n-----\n\nTrojan FRVP!2373982CDABA\nGeneric Dropper.aou\nTrojan-FSGY!3C6009D4D7B2\nTrojan-FRVP!CEE70135CBB1\nW97M/Downloader.cxu\nTrojan-FRVP!63178C414AF9\nExploit-cve2017-0199.ch\nTrojan-FRVP!AF83AD63D2E3\nRDN/Generic Downloader.x\nW97M/Downloader.bjp\nW97M/MacroLess.y\n\nNSP customers will have new signatures added to the “ HTTP: Microsoft Office OLE Arbitrary Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE2017-0199)” attack name.
