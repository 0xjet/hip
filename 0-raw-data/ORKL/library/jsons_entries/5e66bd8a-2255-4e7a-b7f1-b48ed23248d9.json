The\nattackers modified two of the software installers available for download on this website and added a\nbackdoor in order to compromise users of the legitimate application.\n\nESET researchers uncovered this new supply-chain attack in early December 2020 and notified the\ncompromised organization and the VNCERT. We believe that the website has not been delivering\ncompromised software installers as of the end of August 2020 and ESET telemetry data does not\nindicate the compromised installers being distributed anywhere else. The Vietnam Government\nCertification Authority confirmed that they were aware of the attack before our notification and that they\nnotified the users who downloaded the trojanized software.\n\n## Supply-chain attack in Vietnam\n\nIn Vietnam, digital signatures are very common, as digitally-signed documents have the same level of\n[enforceability as “wet” signatures. According to Decree No. 130/2018, the cryptographic certificates](https://helpx.adobe.com/sign/using/legality-vietnam.html)\nused to sign documents must be granted by one of the authorized certificate providers that include the\nVGCA, which is part of the Government Cipher Committee. That committee, in turn, depends on the\nMinistry of Information and Communication.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition to issuing certificates, the VGCA develops and distributes a digital signature toolkit. It is used\nby the Vietnamese government, and probably by private companies, to sign digital documents. The\ncompromise of a certification authority website is a good opportunity for APT groups, since visitors are\nlikely to have a high level of trust in a state organization responsible for digital signatures.\n\nAs shown in Figure 1, it seems that these programs are deployed in the Party and State agencies.\n\nFigure 1. Screenshot of ca.gov.vn\n\nAccording to ESET telemetry, ca.gov.vn was compromised from at least the 23 of July to the 16 ofrd th\nAugust 2020. Two of the installers available for download, gca01-client-v2-x32-8.3.msi and gca01-clientv2-x64-8.3.msi, were modified to include a piece of malware known as PhantomNet or SManager and\n[recently analyzed by NTT Security. We were able to confirm that those installers were downloaded from](https://insight-jp.nttsecurity.com/post/102glv5/pandas-new-arsenal-part-3-smanager)\nca.gov.vn over the HTTPS protocol, so we believe it is unlikely to be a man-in-the-middle attack. The\nURLs pointing to malicious installers were:\n\nhttps://ca.gov[.]vn/documents/20182/6768590/gca01-client-v2-x64-8.3.msi\nhttps://ca.gov[.]vn/documents/20182/6768590/gca01-client-v2-x32-8.3.msi\n\nThis is also confirmed by data from VirusTotal as shown in Figure 2.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2. Screenshot of VirusTotal. It shows the URL where the trojanized installer was downloaded from.\n\nThe trojanized installers are not properly signed, but we noticed that clean GCA installers are also\nincorrectly signed (The digital signature of the object did not verify). Both the official and trojanized MSIs\nuse a certificate assigned to the Safenet company.\n\nFigure 3 is a summary of the supply-chain attack. To be compromised, a user would have to manually\ndownload and execute the compromised software hosted on the official website.\n\nFigure 3. Simplified scheme of the supply-chain attack.\n\nOnce downloaded and executed, the installer starts the genuine GCA program and the malicious file.\nThe malicious file is written to C:\\Program Files\\VGCA\\Authentication\\SAC\\x32\\eToken.exe. By also\ninstalling the legitimate program, the attackers make sure that this compromise won’t be easily noticed\nby the end-users.\n\nThis malicious file is a simple dropper that extracts a Windows cabinet file (.cab) named 7z.cab and that\ncontains the backdoor.\n\n\n-----\n\nIf the dropper runs as an admin, the backdoor is written to C:\\Windows\\apppatch\\netapi32.dll and for the\npersistence, the dropper registers the malicious DLL as a service.\n\nIf run as a regular user, the backdoor is written to %TEMP%\\Wmedia\\<GetTickCount>.tmp and for the\npersistence, the dropper creates a scheduled task that calls the export Entery of the malicious DLL. It’s\ninteresting to note that the Entery export was also seen in versions of TManger used by TA428, as\n[detailed by NTT Security.](https://insight-jp.nttsecurity.com/post/102gi9b/pandas-new-arsenal-part-1-tmanger)\n\n## PhantomNet\n\nThe backdoor was named Smanager_ssl.DLL by its developers but we use PhantomNet, as that was\nthe project name used in an older version of this backdoor. This most recent version was compiled on\nthe 26 of April 2020, almost two months before the supply-chain attack. In addition to Vietnam, weth\nhave seen victims in the Philippines, but unfortunately we did not uncover the delivery mechanism in\nthose cases.\n\nThis backdoor is quite simple and most of the malicious capabilities are likely deployed through\nadditional plugins. It can retrieve the victim’s proxy configuration and use it to reach out to the command\nand control (C&C) server. This shows that the targets are likely to be working in a corporate network.\n\nPhantomNet uses the HTTPS protocol to communicate with its hardcoded C&C servers:\nvgca.homeunix[.]org and office365.blogdns[.]com. In order to prevent a man-in-the-middle attack,\n[PhantomNet implements certificate pinning, using functions from the SSPI library. The certificate is](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/rpc/security-support-provider-interface-sspi-)\ndownloaded during the first connection with the C&C server and then stored in the Windows certificate\nstore.\n\nIn addition to the use of dynamic DNS providers, it is interesting to note that the name of the first\nsubdomain, vgca, was chosen in order to mimic the name of the Vietnam Government Certification\nAuthority.\n\nThe implant can be controlled by the attackers using these five commands:\n\n**Command**\n**ID** **Description**\n\n0x00110020 Get victim information (computer name, hostname, username, OS version, user\nprivileges (admin or not), and the public IP address by querying ipinfo.io).\n\n0x00110030 Call the export DeletePluginObject of all installed plugins.\n\n0x00110040 Plugin management (install, remove, update). The plugins have the following exports\n(including the typo in the first one): GetPluginInfomation, GetRegisterCode,\nGetPluginObject, DeletePluginObject.\n\n0x00110070 Set a value of a given field in the main structure of the backdoor.\n\n0x547CBA78 Generate and set a password using the SSPI functions. The final purpose is unknown.\n\nOn VirusTotal, we found one plugin that matches the exports above. It is a debug build and is named\nSnowballS according to its PDB path and other debug paths:\n\nE:\\WorkCode\\AD_Attacker\\Server\\EXE_DEBUG\\SnowballS.pdb\n\n\n-----\n\ne:\\workcode\\ad_attacker\\server\\plugins\\plugins\\snowballs\\cdomainquery.cpp\n\nAn initial, cursory analysis suggests that this tool might be used for lateral movement, as it embeds\n[Invoke-Mimikatz. It can also collect information about the victim machine and user accounts. This shows](https://github.com/clymb3r/PowerShell/blob/master/Invoke-Mimikatz/Invoke-Mimikatz.ps1)\nthat PhantomNet can receive additional and complex plugins that are probably only deployed on\nmachines of particular interest to the malware operators.\n\nIn the case of the attack in Vietnam, we were not able to recover data about post-compromise activity\nand thus we don’t have visibility into the end goal of the attackers.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n[With the compromise of Able Desktop, the attack on](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/12/10/luckymouse-ta428-compromise-able-desktop/) [WIZVERA VeraPort by Lazarus and the recent](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/11/16/lazarus-supply-chain-attack-south-korea/)\n[supply-chain attack on SolarWinds Orion, we see that supply-chain attacks are a quite common](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-with-sunburst-backdoor.html)\ncompromise vector for cyberespionage groups. In this specific case, they compromised the website of a\nVietnamese certificate authority, in which users are likely to have a high level of trust.\n\nSupply-chain attacks are typically hard to find, as the malicious code is generally hidden among a lot of\nlegitimate code, making its discovery significantly more difficult.\n\n_[For any inquiries, contact us as threatintel@eset.com.
