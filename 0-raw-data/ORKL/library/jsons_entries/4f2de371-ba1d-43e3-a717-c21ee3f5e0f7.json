We\nuse our vantage point as one of the largest and most global\nprofessional services networks to deliver one of the most\nglobal threat intelligence services to our clients. Our research\nunderpins all of our security services, and is used by public\nand private sector organisations around the world to protect\nnetworks, provide situational awareness, and inform strategy.\nThis annual report documents the overarching and thematic\ntrends we observed in 2021, and is part of our contribution to\nhelp build a secure digital society.\n\nAffiliate programmes and Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS)\nschemes fostered further growth of the cybercrime threat,\nand its hidden impact on lives was increasingly laid bare as\nschools, charities, public services, and critical infrastructure\noften bore the brunt of indiscriminate targeting. These\nschemes streamlined compromise-to-profit pipelines –\nproviding financial incentives, reputation-based deals, and\neven furnishing operators with resources such as step-bystep intrusion playbooks. At the same time, ransomware\nschemes continued to strengthen mutualistic ties to the\ncyber criminal ecosystem surrounding them, including\nmalware delivery systems (like TrickBot, IcedID, and QakBot),\nunderground forums facilitating ransomware affiliate\nrecruitment, and Access-as-a-Service (AaaS) markets.\n\nWhile 2020 was dominated by the COVID-19 pandemic, its\nspread throughout the world and it’s impact in cyber space, a\nmajor trend in 2021 was the proliferation of cyber capabilities.\n0-day vulnerabilities resumed as a major concern discussed\n\n\nin cybersecurity conversations, with issues surrounding their\nresearch, disclosure, and exploitation attracting greater public\nscrutiny. These arose particularly in relation to indiscriminate\ntargeting and issues of national security, as threat actors of\nall motivations and capabilities rushed to exploit high-profile\nvulnerabilities such as ProxyLogon and Log4Shell. The abuse\nof 0-day exploits also interlinked with two other phenomena:\nthe impact of digital quartermasters on the cyber threat\nlandscape (including that of commercial quartermasters), and\nsurveillance activity against civilian targets.\n\nIntelligence gathering operations, for the most part, remained\naligned with geopolitical events. However, in 2021, more than\nany other year so far, we identified new and emerging clusters\nof activity pursuing objectives aligned with specific countries’\nstrategic interests, including threat actors likely based\nin countries from which we had not previously observed\noffensive cyber activity originating.\n\nThe analysis in this report was conducted by the PwC Threat\nIntelligence practice, which is distributed across Australia,\nItaly, Germany, Netherlands, Sweden, United Kingdom, and\nthe United States. It is based on our in-house intelligence\ndatasets on cyberattacks and targeting from a wide variety\nof threat actors, intelligence gleaned from PwC’s incident\nresponse engagements around the world, and our managed\nthreat hunting services, as well as publicly available\ninformation.\n\n\n-----\n\n### A perfect storm:\n\n\n### 0-days, quartermasters,\n\n and surveillance\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Year of the 0-day\n\n0-day vulnerabilities, and particularly their research and\ndisclosure, have been an ever-present topic of interest in\nthe cybersecurity community. In 2021, several high-profile\nevents, including highly targeted operations as well as mass\nexploitation of vulnerabilities, brought this topic yet again to\nthe fore of strategic and tactical discussions, and into the\npublic eye.\n\nRather than treating 0-days as an insurmountable threat, in\nthis section we provide strategic context of this phenomenon.\n\n###### Day by (0)day: a strategic overview of the\n zero-day landscape\n\nDiscussions about 0-days often revolve about the difficulty of\navoiding them, based on the perception they might be even\nharder to defend against. In 2021, we saw coverage of this\ntopic spilling into the mainstream, together with other highprofile topics like supply chain targeting (in the wake of the\nSolarWinds incident) and ransomware (following attacks on\nentities like Colonial Pipeline). The year 2021 also registered\nthe largest number of 0-days disclosed in a single year[1],\nalmost doubling 2020’s figures. The reasons behind this\nsurge are nuanced, and likely the result of a combination\nof factor, including:\n\n- \u0007A more overt element of national security: While 0-days\n\nhave been abused for years, 2021 saw several political\ndisplays of “0-day diplomacy”; that is, discussions about\ntheir usage on a national security level. As an example,\nGermany’s newly elected coalition made a political\nstatement on the embargo of government purchase of\n0-days, citing their “highly problematic relationship to IT\nsecurity and civil rights.”[2] The Cyberspace Administration\nof China (CAC) announced new laws surrounding\ndomestic vulnerability disclosure.[3] The new law also\napplies to vendors, which must ensure any vulnerabilities\nare mitigated in a timely manner and promptly disclosed\nto customers along with fixes, and encourages private\norganisations to set up bug bounty programs to financially\nincentivise vulnerability research.\n\n- \u0007The market for 0-days has expanded: Over the past\n\nfew years, there have been an increasing number of\nplayers operating in the vulnerability research space:\nfrom individual security researchers, to 0-day criminal\nbrokers, to private espionage companies such as Hacking\nTeam, FinFisher, NSO Group, and Candiru. Exploit\nbrokers and private sector organisations, particularly, are\namong the most prominent players with regards to 0-day\ndevelopment and trading.\n\n\n\n- \u0007More incentives than ever before: There are now\n\nincreasing avenues for vulnerability researchers to\ncompete and earn financial rewards for their exploit\ndevelopment work. These can be legitimate, such as the\nTianfu Cup and Pwn2Own, or illegitimate, as has been\nthe case with offensive research contests launched on\nRussian-language dark web forums.[4] With this activity\nfirmly rooted in the offensive security world, defenders\nhave had to respond, dedicating resources to their own\nexploit development work for identification and disclosure\npurposes, such as with Google’s Project Zero.[5]\n\n- \u0007A renewed focus on third-party infection: Threat\n\nactors with a variety of motivations have begun targeting\norganisations involved in supply chains, often enabling\naccess to multiple targets at once. This has led to an\ninvestment of resources into vulnerability research of\nwidely used business technologies, such as email servers,\nor knowledge management software as key examples.\nThis naturally increased the amount of 0-days discovered,\nand, with their disclosure (even where responsible and\naccompanied by vendor fixes and advisories), the amount\nof attempts at exploiting those very vulnerabilities.\n\nUltimately, preventing 0-days is not a trivial matter for software\ndevelopers and vendors, let alone for their customer base.\nHowever, customers and defenders should not underestimate\nthe capabilities and measures that can be put in place with a\nfocus on detection and response to post-exploitation behaviours\nand activity. Coupled with robust core security hygiene, a solid\ndetection and response function can make a difference in the\nimpact that new 0-days might have on organisations.\n\n#### An overview of quartermaster activity\n\nThe way threat actors procure and provision tools can affect\nnot only attribution, but, more importantly, their capabilities\nand ability to pursue new target pools. The concept of a digital\nquartermaster is not new when it comes to cyber operations,\nbut remains increasingly relevant. Quartermasters have been\ntraditionally associated with supplying technology to military\nunits. Consequently, digital quartermasters are more often\nthought of in the context of Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)\nactors gaining access to capabilities only shared among a\nselect group of threat actors, or obtaining tools from a central\nentity in charge of distributing them and enabling their use.\n\nHowever, PwC also defines the companies that sell\noffensive security solutions such as spyware, 0-day exploits,\nand related capabilities, to entities that then operate\nthem as ‘Commercial Quartermasters.’ While traditional\nquartermasters often only provide tools to threat\nactors based in the quartermaster’s own country,\ncustomers of commercial quartermasters might be\n\n\n-----\n\n###### APT quartermasters\n\nWhile it is not always possible to prove, the hypothesis that\nmultiple APT groups operate under, or are resourced by, the\nsame digital quartermaster cannot be ruled out for various\nsets of threat actors. In 2021, we continued to observe\nthis phenomenon, whether through observations of shared\ncapability (malware, techniques, exploits, and so on), or\nthrough overlaps in infrastructure (either through the same\npatterns observed on C2s, or the reuse of domains/IPs by\nother threat actors).\n\n**Of Shadows and Proxies: China-based threat actors**\n**sharing tools**\nThe continued sharing of tools and techniques is a running\ntheme among China-based threat actors. While not all of the\nChina-based threat actors share tools with one another, and\nnot all of them have access to the same tools, quartermaster\narrangements (covered in more detail in a later section)\ncontinue to complicate attribution of activity. For example,\nthe same malware families (such as PlugX, PoisonIvy,\nShadowPad, Quarian, and the Winnti backdoor) are used by\nmultiple China-based threat actors, and, as has become very\nwell known in 2021 with the ProxyLogon incidents, some\nthreat actors share exploits as well.\n\nWe note that while not all of these threat actors have been\nobserved having access to the shared tools detailed\nbelow, these are prime examples of the dynamic\ndescribed in this section.\n\n\n**ShadowPad and Scatterbee**\nShadowPad is a modular backdoor that allows a threat actor\nto customise the functionality delivered in an implant. Every\nShadowPad sample that we have seen has a root module\ndesigned to orchestrate the next set of modules, including a\nplugins module that can then be customised depending on\nthe functionality that the threat actor requires. The plugins\ncan enable capabilities that may include, among others, C2\ncommunications over HTTP or TCP, keylogging, screenshot\ngathering, port mapping, and system information gathering.[6 ]\n\nIn tracking “standard” ShadowPad samples in 2021,\nwe identified and analysed a new variant, which we\ncall ScatterBee: samples of ShadowPad that had been\nobfuscated using a custom technique.[7] Likely in order to\nminimise detection on victim networks, the ScatterBee\npacking mechanism implements control flow obfuscation,\nstring encoding, dynamic API resolutions, several antianalysis techniques, as well as shellcode decoding/\ndecrypting. We assess that one or more users of ShadowPad\nhave access to ScatterBee, and have highly likely delivered\nsome of these malicious payloads via watering hole attacks\non sites that are used to deliver Adobe Flash update files. We\nassess that most ScatterBee payloads can be directly linked\nback to the threat actor we track as Red Dev 10 (aka Earth\nLusca), and have been used to target organisations in the\naerospace and defence sectors.\n\nWe assess ShadowPad to be highly likely used by at least\n11 China-based threat actors.[8] Our analysis into specific\nsubsets of ShadowPad infrastructure allowed us to identify a\nwide set of victims, ranging from India-based entities in the\ntelecommunications and oil and gas sectors, to East Asian\nbranches of international humanitarian organisations\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 1: Geographic distribution of ShadowPad victims observed until December 2021**\n\nSource: PwC\n\n\n**“Exchanging” Exchange: ProxyLogon**\nIn early 2021, Red Dev 13 (aka HAFNIUM) began exploiting\nvulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange, which became\ncollectively known as ProxyLogon.[9, 10, 11] While the initial\nactivity surrounding ProxyLogon was associated exclusively\nwith HAFNIUM, at the end of February/beginning of March\n2021 (close but prior to the time of the first public disclosure\nof these campaigns), multiple China-based threat actors\nstarted exploiting the same vulnerabilities, on a mass scale\nversus precise targeting.\n\nAs we have already highlighted, it is not uncommon for these\nthreat actors to share tools. However, the rapid sharing\nof these exploits ahead of the patching of the Microsoft\nExchange vulnerabilities was unprecedented.\n\n**Iran-based developers working across multiple APTs**\nThreat actors are typically identified by the capabilities,\ninfrastructure, targeting, and general TTPs they display.\nHowever, developers or operators behind campaigns working\nacross multiple threat actors can muddy analysis and\nattribution.\n\nThis can occasionally be the case with Iran-based threat\nactors For example through researching phishing campaigns\n\n\na set of malicious PDF documents targeting the higher\neducation sector. This targeting did not normally align with\nYellow Liderc,[12] but matches that of Yellow Garuda (aka\nCharming Kitten, APT35, PHOSPHORUS, TA453, and ITG18).\nWe have previously noted infrastructure overlaps between\nthese two threat actors, raising the hypothesis that Yellow\nLiderc is an offshoot of Yellow Garuda.[13] Based on several\nsimilarities between these threat actors, we assess there is\na realistic probability that an operator has either spanned or\ntransitioned between the two during 2021.\n\n###### Commercial quartermasters\n\nCommercial quartermasters differ from companies defined\nas hack-for-hire, like CyberRoot and BellTroX.[14] Hack-for-hire\ncompanies are tasked with doing the actual hacking on behalf\nof a paying client, while commercial quartermasters only offer\ntools paid for by the client, which then are used by the client\nthemselves to do the hacking. Early examples of commercial\nquartermasters include Hacking Team and FinFisher, both of\nwhich were at the centre of considerable public outrage and\nhave since rebranded or gone bankrupt. Despite the fallout\nfrom these companies’ activities, PwC continues to observe\nthreat actors particularly those running surveillance operations\n\n\n-----\n\nThe recent public spotlight on commercial quartermasters like\nNSO Group and Candiru has provided insight into a relatively\nsecretive and growing industry that has implications for\ncybersecurity professionals and potential victims, including:\n\n- \u0007difficulty in attributing threat actors that would otherwise\n\nnot be capable of conducting such sophisticated\noperations;\n\n- \u0007rapid enablement of a country to target both the private\n\nand public sector with advanced malware, such as a\ncompany, government body, or its personnel; and,\n\n- \u0007the potential abuse of these tools to target journalists,\n\nactivists, and civil society.\n\nAdditionally, the tools produced by commercial\nquartermasters are almost certainly used against a wide\narray of targets, which may also include government officials\nand private sector executives, warranting attention by\norganisations that might not think these types of threat actors\nfit within their threat profile.\n\n#### An ever-watchful eye: surveillance and civil society\n\nWhether armed by the rise of exploit brokers and surveillance\nsoftware vendors, enhanced through quartermaster\narrangements, or performed by state-sponsored groups,\nsurveillance of civilian targets poses a significant threat to\nachieving a secure digital society for all. Minorities, civil rights\nactivists, dissidents, politicians, and journalists, as well as\ncivilians more broadly, frequently fall in the crosshairs of such\nstate-sponsored espionage activity. Civil society targets often\nalso include NGOs, social movements, coalitions, and faithbased organisations that may share common interests.\n\nWhile surveillance activity often focuses on a person of\ninterest, organisations associated with those individuals are\nsometimes found to be victims, where the organisation is\nconsidered a stepping stone to access the intended target.\nThis factor is useful for contextualising threats to civil society\nas a shared problem.\n\n###### Powering surveillance: from hacker-for-hire to commercial quartermasters\n\n**Candiru**\nIn July 2021 Citizen Lab,[16] Microsoft,[17] and Google[18] all\nexposed to varying degrees a commercial quartermaster\ncalled Candiru, which we track as Grey Mazzikim (aka\nSOURGUM). According to Microsoft, the actor’s spyware\nis alleged to have been deployed against over 100 victims.\nSeveral domains associated with campaigns we tracked\nin 2021 indicated clear targeting of human rights activists\n\n\norganisations. The spyware sold by Grey Mazzikim is highly\nsophisticated and can infect and monitor iPhones, Androids,\nMacs, PCs, and cloud accounts.[19] Once a target is infected\nwith the spyware, the operator can exfiltrate the victim’s\nprivate data from a number of apps and accounts including\nGmail, Skype, Telegram, and Facebook, along with capturing\nbrowsing history and passwords.[20] The threat actor might\nalso be able to turn on the target’s webcam and microphone,\nor take screenshots.\n\nSince Candiru is a supplier to multiple threat actors\nthroughout the world, the complexity and scale of these\nattacks is quite extensive. In efforts to maximise coverage of\nand categorise these threats, PwC tracks Candiru as Grey\nMazzikim and its customers, which currently consist of at\nleast four different threat actors, separately where possible.[21]\nThere are a wide range of targets, but with a distinct focus on\nEurope and the Middle East.\n\n**NSO Group**\nNSO Group, which PwC tracks as Grey Anqa, was founded\nin 2010. The company is most widely known for its spyware\ncalled Pegasus, but also offers a range of other products,\nincluding geolocation software for cell phones and data\nanalytics systems. Its primary services and product offerings\nfocus on mobile devices and networks. Pegasus is known to\ninfect the most recent versions of popular mobile operating\nsystems via zero-click and 0-day exploits, including one of\nthe most sophisticated exploits ever documented, known as\nFORCEDENTRY.[22, 23]\n\nNSO made headlines on multiple occasions for selling its\nPegasus spyware to nation-states that ultimately abused the\ntools to spy on civil society.\n\nThe recognisable similarities between Grey Anqa and Grey\nMazzikim are many: similar type of company, operating from\nthe same country, recruiting from the same talent pools, with\na similar customer base. In both cases, the readily available\noffensive capabilities for purchase highlight an industry that\nenables a consumer to wield sophisticated tools that have\nalso been abused in targeting civil society on an international\nscale.\n\n**Pulling the plug: reaction to commercial**\n**quartermasters**\n2021 thrust commercial quartermasters into the public\nspotlight, and into courts of law in multiple countries. For\nexample, several US technology companies are bringing\nlawsuits against commercial spyware providers on behalf of\ntheir customer base, and in some cases seeking to restrict\nthe defendants’ access to the companies’ hardware and\nsoftware. In 2021, we also observed the first high-profile\naction against commercial quartermasters at a state level: the\nUS Commerce Department placed NSO Group and Candiru\non its Entities List, citing a significant risk of them acting\n“contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of\n\n\n-----\n\nA first consequence of such action has been, for example,\nthe Israeli government’s move to restrict by two-thirds the\nlist of countries to which Israeli security firms are allowed to\nsell surveillance and offensive hacking tools. As highlighted\nearlier, we note that commercial quartermasters operate\nin several countries internationally, with numerous brokers\nactive in Europe[25, 26] and in the US.[27]\n\nThe likely enduring existence of commercial quartermasters\nbrings forth a fresh set of challenges. It is relatively easy for\na country to purchase bespoke and highly sophisticated\noffensive tooling that elevates the country’s capabilities to\nthat of an advanced persistent threat. The high sophistication\nof commercial quartermasters, together with their budgets for\nresearch and development, also implies their ability to retool\nwhile maintaining high operational security standards, both of\nwhich allow for end-users to continue to operate even after\npublic exposure.\n\n###### Advanced Persistent Watchers:\n APT surveillance activity\n\n**Red Dev Redemption**\nRed Dev 3 (aka DeepCliff, RedAlpha) is a threat actor active\nsince at least 2015, which was first exposed in open source\nin 2018 by CitizenLab as targeting a specific community.[28]\nThroughout 2021 we observed Red Dev 3 set up hundreds of\ndomains hosting credential phishing pages aimed at diverse\npools of targets on an international scale.[29]\n\nRed Dev 3’s domain naming convention imitates popular mail\nservice providers, and the threat actor may also spoof login\nportals for the specific mail services of the organisations it is\ntargeting. [30]\n\n\nRed Dev 3 also targeted or spoofed services including news\noutlets popular among diaspora communities and dissidents;\nNGOs with a focus on refugees as well as civil and human\nrights, such as Amnesty International; and think tanks and\npolicy institutes.\n\nSince April 2021, we observed a broadening focus of the\nthreat actor’s targeting from civil society to government\nentities, including Ministries of Foreign Affairs in at least\nfive countries, as well as several government and political\norganisations worldwide.[31] However, the threat actor also\ncontinued to brazenly and persistently target individual\ncitizens and vulnerable communities, in relation to sensitive\npolitical and social topics.\n\n**Red Nue’s new antics**\nRed Nue, active since at least 2017, is known for its use\nof the multi-platform LootRAT backdoor, also known as\nReverseWindow.[32] LootRAT has variants for Windows[33] and\nMacintosh[34] (reported in open source as Demsty), as well as\nan Android variant known as SpyDealer.[35] Red Nue has also\nused another Windows backdoor[36] known as WinDealer[37]\nsince at least 2019, when it deployed it to targets as part of\na watering hole campaign on a Chinese news website for the\nChinese diaspora community.\n\nIn 2021, we observed the threat actor continue to iterate\non LootRAT, deploying a Linux variant of the backdoor.[38]\nThe new sample of the backdoor had the binary’s comment\nsection stripped, likely in an attempt to make analysis and\nunderstanding about the threat actor more difficult. All the\nvictims that we observed from this campaign were based\nin Asia, and included a technology company providing\nsimulation software.\n\n\n###### The high sophistication of commercial quartermasters, together with their budgets for research and development, also implies their ability to retool while maintaining high operational security standards, both of which allow for end-users to continue to operate even after public exposure.”\n\n\n-----\n\nParts of Asia feature heavily in Red Nue’s victimology. The\nthreat actor has targeted individuals and universities with the\nDemsty MacOS variant of LootRat. For example, SpyDealer\n(the Android version of LootRAT) has the ability to steal\ninformation from over 40 mobile communications apps,\nincluding WeChat, Facebook, WhatsApp, Skype, Sina Weibo,\nTencent Weibo, and Oupeng Browser, many of which are\nwidely used in China.\n\n**White Dev 75 targeting Middle East and North Africa**\nWhite Dev 75 has been active since at least 2015, and PwC\nhas determined that this threat actor is likely espionagemotivated. Its observed victims are primarily civil society\nmembers, who are likely being targeted in relation to political\ntopics. White Dev 75 continues to be highly effective in\ncompromising email accounts of journalists, dissidents, and\npolitically-involved individuals located throughout the Middle\nEast and North Africa.[39, 40, 41]\n\nBetween at least April and October 2021, White Dev 75\nregistered dozens of new phishing domains that align with\nprevious tactics and procedures observed in its campaigns,\nincluding one impersonating the Ministry of Foreign Affairs\nof a Middle Eastern country. White Dev 75 is particularly\neffective due to its ability to bypass MFA and leverage\nconvincing social engineering techniques. The phishing\nemails White Dev 75 often uses are fake security alerts of\nabnormal login behaviour. The threat actor has also been\nobserved abusing OAuth to circumvent MFA and passwords\nall together.[42] OAuth is a common application allowing\nauthentication of third-party services without the need to\nshare passwords. The observed TTPs of White Dev 75 are\nnot overly advanced but demonstrate a persistence and\ncleverness in its tradecraft that allows it to perpetrate these\ntactics against civil society.\n\n\n# 40+\n\n#### Apps that SpyDealer (the Android version of LootRAT) can steal\n information from\n\n**Yellow Garuda’s domestic surveillance**\nYellow Garuda (aka Charming Kitten, PHOSPHORUS, ITG18)\nis a versatile Iran-based threat actor which has been active\nsince at least 2012. It was highly active throughout 2021,\nconducting a range of activity in a surveillance capacity.\n\nWe found evidence that Yellow Garuda conducted a targeted\ndomestic surveillance campaign to extract data from a\nvictim’s Telegram account.[43] This included the exfiltration\nof messages, media files, details of group memberships,\nand the victim’s contacts. Between September and October\n2021, the threat actor compromised at least six Iran-based\nvictims, based on data obtained by PwC along with copies\nof the actor’s bespoke Telegram ‘grabber’ tool which was\nused to exfiltrate the data from victim accounts. We also\nuncovered an operational report written by the threat actor\nitself concerning surveillance on a seventh domestic victim;\nthe data from this victim was more extensive and likely the\nresult of exfiltration via mobile malware.\n\nThe addition of mobile malware in Yellow Garuda’s toolset\nhas been reported in open source[44] and correlates to our\nown analysis of an Android malware sample with multiple\nlinks to known Yellow Garuda infrastructure in early 2021.[45]\nThis sample masqueraded as the messaging application\nWhatsApp and included the ability to record audio and video,\ntake photos, access contacts, location data and SMS, and\ninitiate calls. Its functionality and codebase was similar to\nan older sample of Android malware from 2018 which was\nreportedly used to target Iranian citizens, indicating that\nYellow Garuda has likely had this capability for some time.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Cyber crime\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Ransomware\n\nRansomware remained the most significant cyber threat\nfaced by most organisations in 2021. The contributing factors\nbehind the ongoing trend remain applicable, with many\namplified by the following observations:\n\n- \u0007the number of threat actors engaged in ransomware\n\noperations increased, powered by the rise in prominence\nof Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) arrangements and\naffiliate schemes;\n\n- \u0007the pace and frequency of publicly reported attacks\n\nalmost doubled; and,\n\n- \u0007leaking of stolen data, or the threat to do so, became\n\nstandard procedure for the majority of high profile threat\nactors adding privacy, regulatory, and reputational risks\nto the crisis of business disruption caused by data\nencryption.\n\n\nThe overwhelming majority of ransomware incidents were\nfinancially-motivated, with a limited set of attacks likely to\nhave been politically-motivated and intentionally destructive.\n\nIn 2020, approximately 1,300 ransomware victims had their\ndata exposed on leak sites. This almost doubled in 2021, with\n2,435 victims exposed.\n\n\n**Figure 2: Running total of ransomware leaks in 2021**\n\n2500\n\n2000\n\n1500\n\n1000\n\n500\n\n0\n\nJan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec\n\nSource: PwC\n\n\n# 2,435\n\n#### victims were exposed on leaked sites, nearly double the number exposed\n in 2020\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 3: Ransomware incidents Q1 2021**\n\nConti, 23%\nAvaddon, 12%\nSodinokibi, 10%\nDarkside, 10%\nDoppelPaymer, 10%\nCLOP, 7%\nPysa, 6%\nRagnarok, 5%\nNetWalker, 5%\nBabuk, 4%\nNefilim, 2%\nMountLocker, 2%\nRansomEXX, 2%\nCuba, 2%\nEverest, 1%\nRagnar, <1%\nSuncrypt, <1%\n\nSource: PwC\n\n**Figure 4: Ransomware incidents Q2 2021**\n\nConti, 22%\nAvaddon, 18%\nSodinokibi, 13%\nDarkside, 6%\nPrometheus, 6%\nLV, 5%\nDopelPaymer, 4%\nBabuk, 4%\nXing Team, 3%\nGrief, 3%\nEverest, 3%\nCLOP, 2%\nVice Society, 2%\nAstro, 2%\nRagnar, 1%\nLorenz, 1%\nFile Leaks, 1%\nPysa, 1%\nRansomEXX, 1%\nNefilim, 1%\nRagnarok, 1%\nN3w0rm, 1%\nNoname, 1%\nHive, 1%\nCuba, <1%\nBlack Shadow, <1%\nPayload.bin, <1%\n\nSource: PwC\n\n\nThe number of threat actors engaged in ransomware\noperations fluctuated, with prominent threat actors taking\nbreaks, shutting down altogether, or re-emerging after a gap\nin activity under a new “brand”, as detailed in later sections.\nFor example, in Q1 2021 PwC observed 17 threat actors leak\ndata on approximately 440 victims, but 65% of these attacks\nwere attributable to only five threat actors:\n\n- White Onibi (aka Conti) - 23%\n\n- White Dev 70 (aka Avaddon) - 12%\n\n- White Apep (aka DarkSide) - 10%\n\n- White Ursia (aka Sodinokibi, REvil) - 10%\n\n- Blue Lelantos (aka DoppelPaymer) - 10%\n\nIn Q2 2021, the number of threat actors observed\nconducting ransomware operations increased to 27,\nand the corresponding number of victims was over 500.\nHowever, activity was again dominated by a small number of\nransomware families, with approximately 60% of incidents\nattributable to only four operations:\n\n- Conti - 22%\n\n- Avaddon - 18%\n\n- REvil - 13%\n\n- DarkSide - 6%\n\nWe assess that the notable reduction in DoppelPaymer\noperations in Q2 2021 was likely due to the threat actor\nrebranding its operations, before introducing the ransomware\nvariant known as “Grief”.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 5: Ransomware incidents Q3 2021**\n\nLockBit, 38%\nConti, 16%\nGrief, 5%\nBlackMatter, 5%\nHive, 4%\nPayload.bin, 4%\nCLOP, 3%\nAvoslocker, 3%\nEverest, 3%\nRagnarok, 2%\nVice Society, 2%\nSodinokibi, 2%\nRansomEXX, 1%\nBlackByte, 1%\nLockData, 1%\nLorenz, 1%\nBabuk, 1%\nLV, 1%\nPrometheus, 1%\nCoomingProject, 1%\nPysa, 1%\nKarma, 1%\nBonaci, 1%\nCuba, 1%\nXing Team, 1%\nFile leaks, <1%\nRagnar, <1%\nGroove, <1%\nDarkrypt, <1%\nNefilm, <1%\nBl@ckt0r, <1%\nAtomsilo, <1%\n\nSource: PwC\n\n**Figure 6: Ransomware incidents Q4 2021**\n\nLockBit, 29%\nConti, 21%\nPysa, 7%\nGrief, 4%\nAvosLocker, 4%\nBlackByte, 4%\nLV, 3%\nMidas, 3%\nSnatch,3%\nCL0P, 2%\nSpook, 2%\nMoses Staff, 2%\nHive, 2%\nBlackMatter, 1%\nCuba, 1%\nEverest, 1%\nCoomingProject, 1%\nALPHV-ng, 1%\nQuantum, 1%\nEntropy, 1%\nRansomEXX, <1%\nRook, <1%\nVice Society, <1%\nRagnar, <1%\nSuncrypt, <1%\nSodinokibi, <1%\nAtomsilo, <1%\nGroove, <1%\nRobinhood, <1%\nPayload.bin, <1%\nXing Team, <1%\nBonaci, <1%\nMedusaLocker, <1%\nBlack Shadow, <1%\nLorenz, <1%\n\nSource: PwC\n\n\nBy Q3 2021, significant changes in the ransomware\nmarketplace were beginning to take effect. These were\ncaused by the expulsion of affiliate programmes from their\nmain recruitment sites, and the voluntary dissolution of some\noperations following high profile attacks. However, the most\nsignificant event impacting the ransomware marketplace\nduring this period was the re-emergence of White Janus (aka\nLockBit) as LockBit 2.0 in July 2021. LockBit’s original affiliate\nprogramme was inactive from late 2020 and did not reemerge until July 2021, on the criminal forum RAMP, as White\nJanus reworked its ransomware.[46] The threat actor quickly\nestablished a high tempo operation, accounting for nearly\n40% of observed incidents in Q3. This was likely the result of\nattracting affiliates from other ransomware schemes which\nclosed down at the end of Q2 or the beginning of Q3. Overall\nin Q3, there were 32 threat actors leaking data accounting for\nalmost 600 victims, with 64% of incidents again attributable\nto just four ransomware operations:\n\n- LockBit - 38%\n\n- Conti - 16%\n\n- BlackMatter - 5%\n\n- Grief - 5%\n\nIn Q4 2021, the pace of attacks increased, with approximately\n850 victims added to the tally of observed incidents. As with\nthe previous quarter, the number of threat actors leaking\ndata grew once more, with 35 leak sites active during the\nperiod. LockBit and Conti continued to dominate and 64% of\nobserved incidents were attributable to just five actors:\n\n- LockBit - 29%\n\n- Conti - 21%\n\n- White Thalia (aka Pysa) - 6%\n\n- Grief - 4%; and,\n\n- White Caerus (aka AvosLocker) - 4%\n\nA spike in observed activity by Pysa was the result of an\ninflux of data leaks on 10th November, which was more likely\nthe result of the threat actor updating its often-neglected leak\nsite rather than a surge in Pysa operations from that particular\nperiod.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 7: Ransomware incidents by sector 2021**\n\nManufacturing, 18%\nRetail, 11%\nTMT, 9%\nConstruction, 8%\nFinancial Services, 7%\nProfessional Services, 6%\nLegal, 6%\nHealthcare, 6%\nGovernment, 4%\nLogistics, 3%\nFood, 3%\nAutomotive, 3%\nEducation, 3%\nHospitality, 2%\nReal Estate, 2%\nNGO, 2%\nTransportation, 1%\nUtilities, 1%\nOil & Gas, 1%\nLife Sciences, 1%\nAerospace, <1%\nMining, <1%\n\nSource: PwC\n\n**Sector breakdown**\nRansomware operations are largely indifferent to the\neconomic sector of organisations, although since the\npandemic took hold, many threat actors have made public\nstatements – to which they have not entirely adhered – that\nthey would avoid targeting hospitals or other healthcare\nfacilities. Where targeting objectives have been specified by\nthreat actors, their focus has purely been on the size of the\norganisation (number of endpoints), its geographical location\n(with an emphasis on Canada, the EU, US, and UK) and its\nrevenue.[47] As in 2020, few sectors were immune to attack,\nbut some sectors experienced attacks more frequently than\nothers, with the top six sectors accounting for 60% of all\nincidents noted:\n\n- Manufacturing - 18%\n\n- Retail and Consumer - 11%\n\n- Technology - 9%\n\n- Construction - 8%\n\n- Financial Services - 7%\n\n- Professional Services - 6%\n\nThe same top six sectors accounted for 66% of ransomware\nincidents in 2020.\n\n\nWe have not seen evidence that these sectors are specifically\ntargeted by threat actors. However, if the healthcare sector\nis not included, these six sectors are a close match for the\ntop six industry sectors by revenue in the United States.[48]\nFor some of the most active threat actors – for example\nWhite Onibi – victim revenue is an important factor when\ndetermining whether to proceed with post-exploitation\nactivity after initial access has been achieved. This may have\nsome influence over the distribution of victims by sector.\n\n# 60%\n\n#### of all incidents noted were comprised of six sectors (Manufacturing, Retail and Consumer, Technology, Construction, Financial Services, and Professional Services)\n\n\n-----\n\n**Incident response case study:**\n### HSE\n\n\nThe Republic of Ireland’s Health Service Executive (HSE)\ncommissioned a report by PwC on a Conti attack that disrupted\nHSE IT systems in May 2021. The HSE published this report\non 10th December 2021, marking one of the first global\ninstances of ‘full disclosure’ following such an incident.[49]\n\nOn 14th May 2021, Conti ransomware was activated on\nover 3,500 workstations and 2,800 HSE servers, causing\nwidespread and protracted disruption to healthcare services\nin Ireland, with some healthcare facilities unable to access\npatient data or schedule appointments via electronic\nsystems. The origins of the attack dated back to March\n2021, when a user opened a malicious attachment that had\nbeen delivered via email. There was a significant time gap\nbetween initial access to the network being achieved and\npost-exploitation activity. This was likely the result of the\ninitial compromise being carried out by an Access-as-aService (AaaS) operation, before Conti assumed control of\nthe compromised endpoint to progress the attack.\n\n\nConti is a “human-operated” ransomware system and is\ndeployed through the manual execution of batch commands,\nrather than a malware that propagates through a network\nautomatically, indiscriminately encrypting any infrastructure\nit encounters. The Conti operation followed known TTPs\nassociated with the threat actor, including the deployment\nof Cobalt Strike to facilitate lateral movement and privilege\nescalation within the network; the use of other tools,\nincluding Mimikatz, to identify and compromise administratorlevel accounts and systems, particularly Active Directories;\nand, the exfiltration of data prior to the encryption of files.\nThe impact of the attack could have been much greater if\nConti had been activated on medical systems as well as the\nvictim’s core IT estate. Many of the factors that contributed to\nthe scale and impact of the incident are not unique to HSE.\nThe report highlights lessons that all organisations need to\nconsider in order to prepare for a similar cyberattack and to\nensure they can mitigate and recover from one.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Affiliate programmes\n\nAffiliate programmes continued to be a driving force\nbehind the scale and pace of ransomware operations\nin 2021. Ransomware affiliate programmes generally\noffer access to a specific ransomware strain on a profitsharing basis. In this scheme, a main threat actor, such\nas White Ursia, is responsible for the development and\nmanagement of the malware, and it provides access\nto its affiliates, whose role is to conduct attacks. The\nfunds extorted from victims are divided between the\nransomware operators and their affiliates in pre-agreed,\nprofit-sharing arrangements. This enables threat actors\nwith network intrusion and exploitation skills to acquire\naccess to ransomware and monetisation capabilities they\ncould not easily develop themselves, reducing the barriers\nto entry.\n\nMany of the most prolific ransomware operations, such\nas DarkSide, REvil and LockBit, openly ran ransomware\naffiliate schemes (Партнёрская программа); others, such\nas Conti, recruited “pentesters” without specifying their\nultimate objectives. Affiliate programmes were mainly\npromoted in Russian-speaking criminal forums like\nExploit and XSS. As the number and quality of affiliates\n(адвертов) were a defining factor in the revenue generated\nby many ransomware operations, competition between\nrival schemes intensified. Threat actors boosted their\nprofile by:\n\n- \u0007depositing large sums of cryptocurrency in their forum\n\naccounts, to demonstrate the financial success of their\nscheme;\n\n- \u0007conducting media interviews promoting their\n\noperation’s success and revenue, many of which\nattracted positive coverage in the criminal forums\nwhere they recruited affiliates;\n\n- \u0007posting links to media stories about their operations;\n\n- \u0007offering competitive profit-sharing arrangements to\n\ntheir recruits; and,\n\n- \u0007by claiming technical superiority over their\n\ncompetitors.\n\n\n**Figure 8: DarkSide affiliate recruitment advert**\n\nAffiliate programme DarkSide 2.0 Ransomware\n\ndarksupp -    09.03.2021\n\n09.03.2021\n\n[ Welcome to DarkSide 2.0]\n\ndarksupp **Who are we?**\n\n**Registration:**\n\nWelcome to Darkside Our product is aimed only at large companies.\n.2020\n\nPremium You can read more here:Posts: 17\n\n**Reactions: 28**\n\n**Registration:** **Deposit:**\n\n04.11.2020 23,000\n**Posts:** 17 Beware of the sinister New ‹Dark Side›\n**Reactions: 28** Nem audissi cum sam quidebi tatiscimet dolupta ditatem fa$1 million cyber threat\n**Deposit:** autem.

For example, White\nUrsia announced that it would close\nits REvil affiliate scheme and “go\nprivate”; it subsequently canceled\nits forum memberships altogether.\nWhite Apep announced that it\nwould shut down the DarkSide\nransomware operation, and released\ndecryption keys for the malware.[62]\n\nHowever others, including White\nJanus (aka LockBit) retained their\nmembership, and simply transferred\ntheir affiliate recruitment activities to\ntheir leak site.\n\n\n**Figure 12: XSS Administration bans ransomware activity on the site**\n\nAffiliate programme REvil\n\n13.05.2021\n\n13.05.2021\n\nNo more ransom!

The\nadverts did not openly state that\nrecruitment was being conducted\nfor ransomware operations, but the\njob specifications for many of the\nvacant positions bore similarities to\nprevious affiliate scheme recruitment\ncampaigns.\n\n\n**Figure 15: Pentester recruitment advert by unidentified threat actor**\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Ransomware rebranding\n\nAs another likely consequence of increasing legal and\npolitical pressure, in 2021 we observed one of the\nhighest levels of ransomware rebrandings in recent years.\nRansomware rebrands have three main benefits:\n\n- \u0007allowing for established cybercrime threat actors to\n\n“reboot” their programme after suffering a setback.\n(for example, after the discovery of a flaw in their\nransomware’s encryption routine results in the publication\nof a decrypter for the malware);\n\n\n\n- \u0007providing an opportunity to lay low and reduce the\n\nspotlight on a specific group after a significant amount of\nactivity or campaigns; and,\n\n- \u0007preventing or delaying the attribution of attacks, where the\n\nthreat actor perceives this to be an operational advantage.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Incident response case study:**\n### New job, who this?\n Ransomware\n operator changes\n affiliate schemes\n\n\nIn February 2021, PwC’s incident response team responded\nto a Sodinokibi/REvil attack on a France-based organisation\nin the agriculture sector. The intrusion began in mid-January,\nwhen a malicious attachment, delivered to the company’s\nemployees via a phishing email, led to the installation of\nQakBot on a victim workstation.\n\nAfter achieving initial access, the threat actor deployed Cobalt\nStrike to strengthen its presence in the victim environment.\nIt also started accessing LSASS credentials, relying on the\nWindows Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to move laterally\nacross the network. The threat actor used a mix of BITS\njobs, PowerShell and command-line interaction to install and\nexecute payloads and fingerprint the network. RClone, open\nsource software used to manage content on cloud storage\nsystems, was used to exfiltrate data from the victim’s local and\ncloud storages, before the ransomware was detonated.\n\n\nAlthough the threat actor ultimately deployed Sodinokibi/\nREvil ransomware, the way it operated within the victim\nenvironment aligned more closely with techniques known to\nbe adopted by affiliates of another ransomware programme\nwhich PwC tracks as White Samyaza (aka Egregor, Prolock).\nFor example, while QakBot has also been observed leading\nto REvil infections[63], it is more strongly linked to White\nSamyaza operations[64]. The command-line tool RClone is\nfrequently, though not exclusively, used by Egregor/Prolock\noperators, particularly with the utility being renamed as\n“svchost.exe” to blend in with the victim environment[65].\nAdditionally, the ransomware files observed during the\nincident response were labeled using the victim’s name.\nThis naming scheme is a characteristic unique to Egregor\nransomware and is not typically observed in Sodinokibi/REvil\nransomware (whose files are often named using a random\nnaming scheme).\n\n\n**Based on the evidence we examined, we assess it is highly likely that an affiliate of White Samyaza moved to White**\n**Ursia, and deployed Sodinokibi/REvil using TTPs commonly observed with White Samyaza affiliates.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Blue Lelantos**\nIn December 2019, members of the Russia-based crime\ngroup “Evil Corp” (tracked by PwC as Blue Lelantos) were\nindicted by US authorities and designated for sanctions.[66] Evil\nCorp operations continued throughout 2020, but changes\nto Evil Corp operations became apparent by the end of that\nyear and increasingly noticeable in early 2021. Detections\nof WastedLocker,[67] one of Evil Corp’s principal ransomware\nsystems, all but disappeared in late 2020. However, the\nWastedLocker operation continued throughout 2021, through\na succession of rebrands. In late 2020, WastedLocker ransom\nnotes began appearing as Hades ransomware, Phoenix\nCryptolocker in March, Payloadbin in June, and Macaw in\nOctober.[68] Similarly, DoppelPaymer,[69]\n\nEvil Corp’s high profile “double extortion” operation,\neffectively ceased operations in May, with the last victim\nadded to its leak site that month. In June, a new ransomware\ncalling itself “Grief” or “PayorGrief” emerged and began\nposting victim data on its leak site from the outset. Analysis\nof Grief samples revealed extensive coding similarities\nbetween it and DoppelPaymer, with a major change being\nGrief’s use of the cryptocurrency Monero for ransom\npayments. We assess that Grief is yet another rebranding\nexercise by Evil Corp, and is unlikely to be its last.[70]\n\n**Figure 17: “Welcome to Darkside 2.0” announcement post**\n\n\nAlthough we have no direct evidence of the reasons for\nthe successive rebranding exercises undertaken by Evil\nCorp in 2021, we assess it is highly likely that these are a\nconsequence of the group’s designation as a sanctioned\nentity by the US authorities:\n\n- \u0007As with most ransomware operations, the majority of its\n\nvictims are in the US;\n\n- \u0007An organisation making or facilitating a ransom payment\n\nto a sanctioned entity would potentially place them in\nbreach of US sanctions and therefore less likely to pay;\n\n- \u0007Rebranding WastedLocker and DoppelPaymer made\n\nit more difficult, in the short term at least, to attribute a\nransomware incident to a sanctioned entity; and,\n\n- \u0007Rebranding existing code, rather than writing new\n\nransomware variants from scratch, reduces Evil Corp’s\nopportunity costs and the time required to maintain its\nransomware operations.\n\n**White Apep**\nDarkSide (aka BlackMatter), which PwC tracks as White\nApep, has been in operation since at least August 2020,\nand had already undergone two rebrandings by the close\nof 2021. The first came in January 2021, two months after\nthe launch of DarkSide’s affiliate programme, when security\ncompany Bitdefender developed and publicly released a\ndecryption tool [71] allowing DarkSide victims to recover their\nfiles. White Apep operations went on hiatus, likely to allow the\nthreat actor to retool, and only resumed on 9th March 2021\nunder the rebranded banner of “DarkSide 2.0”. Its return was\naccompanied by a relaunch of its affiliate programme, and\nfeatured an updated version of the ransomware designed to\navoid decryption by the existing tools.[72]\n\nIt was after this first rebranding that one of DarkSide’s\naffiliates conducted one of the most damaging incidents\nobserved in 2021, the successful attack on US-based\nColonial Pipeline on 7th May. The attack led to a shutdown of\noperations on its 5,500 mile pipeline, used to supply almost\nhalf of the US East Coast’s fuel. Increased focus on DarkSide\nby the US government, and a subsequent infrastructure\ntakedown, led the threat actor to announce in mid-May that it\nwould be shutting down operations.[73]\n\n\nAffiliate programme DarkSide 2.0 Ransomware\n\ndarksupp -    09.03.2021\n\n09.03.2021\n\n[ Welcome to DarkSide 2.0]\n\ndarksupp **Who are we?**\n\n**Registration:**\n\nWelcome to Darkside Our product is aimed only at large companies.\n.2020\n\nPremium You can read more here:Posts: 17\n\n**Reactions: 28**\n\n**Registration:** **Deposit:**\n\n04.11.2020 23,000\n**Posts:** 17 Beware of the sinister New ‹Dark Side›\n**Reactions: 28** $1 million cyber threatNem audissi cum sam quidebi tatiscimet dolupta ditatem\n**Deposit:** autem.

Q\n\n\n-----\n\nWhite Apep’s second rebranding came in late July, in the\nform of a new RaaS system titled “BlackMatter”. The new\nransomware shared parts of its code, though not all, with\nDarkSide 2.0; these included code routines implementing\nprivilege escalation, victim fingerprinting, and networking\ncapabilities.[74]\n\nGrowing pressure from law enforcement led to White Apep\nonce again announcing its departure from the ransomware\nscene in November 2021. The decision was shortly followed\nby the US Justice Department announcing a US$10m\nreward for any potential information on the group. [75] At the\nend of 2021, White Apep operations remained inactive.\nHowever, given the number of transformations White Apep’s\nransomware and overall operations have undergone, we\nassess that there is a realistic probability that this shutdown\nof operations is a chance for it to remain under the radar, only\nto re-emerge with yet another rebrand. There is circumstantial\nevidence that ALPHV-ng (aka BlackCat), which is currently\ntracked by PwC as White Dev 101, is yet another rebrand.\nThe threat actor’s affiliate scheme was launched on RAMP\non 9th December 2021, and PwC’s incident response team\nhas responded to multiple BlackCat incidents conducted by\na specific affiliate who was previously part of the BlackMatter\nscheme.\n\n**White Ursia**\nWhite Ursia was one of the most active ransomware\nthreat actors in the first half of 2021. The public face of its\noperation, using the online identities ‘UNKN’ and ‘Unknown’\non Exploit and XSS respectively, maintained a high profile,\nconducting interviews and promoting REvil’s affiliate\nprogramme. It is likely that mounting pressure on White Ursia,\n\n\nafter it found itself the subject of greater scrutiny following\nthe Kaseya and JBS attacks, initiated its first offline move in\n2021. ‘UNKN’ had already announced the decision to “go\ndark” following the expulsion of affiliate programmes from\nXSS and Exploit in May. White Ursia’s “Happy Blog”, the leak\nsite used to publish compromised victim data, went offline\nin mid-July, as did its ransom payment infrastructure. REvil\noperations ceased and ‘UNKN’ no longer posted comments\non XSS or Exploit after 4th July. The shutdown of REvil’s\npayment infrastructure, as well as the disappearance of\n‘UNKN’ damaged the reputation of the threat actor.\n\nIn September new online personas – ‘REvil’ on Exploit and\n‘0_neday’ on XSS – announced that, following ‘UNKN’s’\ndisappearance, they had been able to restore REvil\noperations from backups. White Ursia resumed operations\nand posted data on six victims between 10th September\nand 14th October, before the site went down again, this time\nprobably for good. ‘0_neday’ claimed to have lost control\nof REvil infrastructure following a suspected cyberattack\ntargeting the threat actor personally and had decided to lie\nlow. On 14th January 2022, the FSB announced that they had\ndetained 14 suspects and searched 25 premises connected\nwith an investigation into the REvil operation. [76] Although\nat least some of the arrests occurred in early 2022, it is a\nrealistic probability that elements of the REvil operation\nhad been disrupted by the Russian authorities prior to the\naction taken in January 2022. Several criminal threat actors\nin XSS speculated that UNKN’s disappearance in July and\nsubsequent “radio silence” was also the result of FSB action.\nHowever, it is impossible to verify these claims.\n\n\n###### Supply chain compromise: the new normal\n\nSupply chain attacks have long been a tried and tested formula used by multiple threat actors. While they are\ntraditionally associated with state-sponsored threat actors, financially motivated threat actors have also been\nsuccessful in exploiting them. In early 2021 White Austaras (aka TA505), the threat actor in control of CL0P\nransomware, was able to compromise multiple organisations that were using the legacy file transfer software\nAccellion FTA. White Austaras exfiltrated data from fewer than 25 victims, and threatened to expose it on the\nCL0P leak site if a ransom was not paid.[77, 78]\n\nIn July 2021, White Ursia compromised multiple organisations that were clients of Kaseya, a US company\nspecialising in network and IT management software, by abusing the company’s VSA software to deliver\nmalicious payloads. The attack was on a much greater scale than the Accellion incident, with as many as 1,400\norganisations affected by REvil/Sodinokibi ransomware.[79]\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Delivery and access\n\n###### Delivery systems\n\nMalware delivery systems have proven to be a vital\ncompanion to ransomware threat actor arsenals. These are\npieces of software specifically designed to house malicious\npayloads, which are later dropped by the threat actor to\ngain an initial entry onto a target system or network. In 2021,\nwith both established players and new entrants active in the\nmalware delivery market, cyber criminal threat actors had the\noption to flit between several and determine the most reliable\nand dependable option for their operations.\n\n**Emotet**\nEmotet, which PwC tracks as White Taranis, is one of the\nmost prominent and long-running malware delivery systems.\nEarly 2021 saw an international law enforcement takedown,\nnamed Operation LadyBird, of Emotet’s botnet infrastructure.\nThe operation, which saw over 700 devices used for Emotet’s\nC2 systems seized, alongside arrests made in Ukraine,[80, 81]\nimpeded the threat actor from conducting its malicious spam\nand spear phishing email campaigns for a significant portion\nof the year.\n\nHowever, in mid-November PwC observed Trickbot, the\nbanking trojan operated by the group PwC tracks as White\nMagician, delivering malicious Emotet binaries to infected\nTrickbot machines, and executing them in memory. This was\nlikely an attempt by the threat actor to help restore Emotet’s\ncommand and control infrastructure. This technique is in line\nwith similar activity associated with White Taranis, where\nEmotet was used as a means to help deliver Trickbot binaries\nafter a similar takedown of Trickbot occured in October 2020.\n\nAlongside the delivery of Emotet binaries and the return of\nits command and control infrastructure we also saw the\n\n\n4 and Epoch 5. This added to the three other botnet servers,\nEpoch 1, Epoch 2, and Epoch 3, which were previously used\nby White Taranis to infect machines. Further updates were\nalso observed to Emotet’s encryption capabilities, used to\nencrypt network traffic, and to its communication protocols.[82\n]\n\nThese additions to Emotet’s arsenal underscore the\nsignificant capabilities that White Taranis has access to,\nand the continued threat it poses to organisations.\n\nThe absence of Emotet during most of 2021 saw a significant\nproportion of its client base forced to look at other forms of\nmalware delivery. In 2021, malware delivery systems such as\nBuerloader, Bazar, SquirrelWaffle, and IcedID all significantly\nincreased their activity, which was likely the result of the gap\nEmotet left following its takedown.\n\n**Colder than IcedID**\nThe threat actor that PwC tracks as White Khione is behind\nthe malware delivery system IcedID (aka Bokbot), which is\nassociated with high profile ransomware systems such as\nConti and Sodinokibi/REvil. First identified in 2017, IcedID\nwas originally developed as a banking trojan, capable of\nstealing financial information. However, similar to other\nbanking trojans, IcedID was later repurposed as a piece of\nmodular malware designed to provide remote access to\nnetworks, which would later be sold to other users as part of\nthe “Access as a Service” model.[83] In 2021, IcedID stepped\nup its capacity in Emotet’s absence, proving one of the most\nconsistent malware delivery systems. Its core capability lies\nwithin its consistent email spam campaigns, which are used\nto initiate the infection chain. Further capabilities include\nremote code execution and web browser injection, which\nenables IcedID to perform person-in-the-middle attacks with\nthe intended goal of extracting financial information. However,\nIcedID is typically used to deploy further-stage payloads such\nas Cobalt Strike.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Access as a Service (AaaS)\n\nDelivery systems, like Emotet and IcedID, have\nconsistently been the choice of initial access for many\ncyber criminal threat actors. However, their availability\nand accessibility can be unreliable, with some systems\nbeing forced offline, while others require a long standing\nrelationship in order to gain access to the malware\ndelivery services. This has provided leeway for the Access\nas a Service (AaaS) marketplace to grow in 2021. These\nmarketplaces allow the buying and selling of access to\ncompromised hosts from a wide range of organisations\nand sectors, usually in the form of RDP and VPN\naccess, as well as webshells. Various Russian-language\ncriminal forums such as Exploit and XSS, and dedicated\nmarketplaces such as Odin and MagBo, are used to\nadvertise access listings.[84]\n\nA primary driver behind the rise in AaaS is the lower\nbarrier of entry it provides for new threat actors. AaaS\nremoves the need for threat actors to conduct complex\nintrusion or widespread phishing campaigns to gather\ncredentials. With AaaS, the initial intrusion has already\nbeen completed, enabling the purchaser to transition\nstraight into post-exploitation activity and ransomware\ndeployment. In 2021, we witnessed several prolific\nransomware threat actors or their affiliates making use\nof AaaS as a means of initial access, including White\nJanus (aka Lockbit 2.0) and White Apep (aka BlackMatter,\nDarkSide).\n\n\n**Figure 18: White Apep seeking access to corporate**\n**networks on the forum Exploit**\n\n\n-----\n\n### Regional\n\n\n### activity\n\n##### In this section, we describe campaigns conducted by the threat actors we believe to be based in specific geographic regions and ranging from intelligence-gathering operations (in support of political and/or national strategic objectives) to financially-motivated activity: both targeted and opportunistic. As in 2020, we continued to see the cyber threat landscape aligning with geopolitical circumstances, with real-world events influencing espionage- and sabotage-motivated operations alike. As in 2020, we continued to see the cyber threat landscape aligning to the geopolitical situation, with real-world events driving espionage and sabotage-motivated operations alike.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Asia-Pacific\n\n#### Hard drive to survive\n\nIn North Korea, a centrepiece of Kim Jong-un’s political\ndoctrine is the country’s continued development of its nuclear\nforce, accompanied by a focus on national finances. Overall,\ncyber operations have highly likely been one of the North\nKorean state’s main avenues for thwarting the impact of\ninternational sanctions and achieving its strategic objectives.\nCryptocurrency in particular is a crucial source of income for\nNorth Korea’s regime, with multiple North Korea-based threat\nactors targeting organisations and individuals involved with\ncryptocurrency, particularly cryptocurrency exchanges, since\nat least 2017.[85]\n\n###### Bitcoin is silver, compromise is gold: the newest North Korea-based threat actor(s)\n\nThroughout 2021, we observed two main clusters of activity\nthat we assess were highly likely conducted by North\nKorea-based threat actors, and which targeted entities\ndealing with cryptocurrency and the financial sector on an\ninternational scale. We initially tracked these two clusters\nseparately, respectively as Black Alicanto (aka Dangerous\nPassword, LeeryTurtle, CryptoMimic, CryptoCore, Operation\nSnatchCrypto)[86,] [87] and Black Dev 2 (aka Operation Gold\nHunting, Operation SnatchCrypto). Ultimately, overlaps in\ncapabilities, infrastructure, and victimology led us to assess\nthat Black Alicanto and Black Dev 2 are likely to be the\nsame North Korea-based threat actor. We further assess this\nthreat actor to be highly likely an evolution of Black Artemis’\n(aka Lazarus Group, HIDDEN COBRA) financially-motivated\nsubgroup Bluenoroff.\n\nBelow, we present Black Alicanto and Black Dev 2\nindividually to give an overview of the differing TTPs that we\nassociated with the two clusters of activity.\n\n\n**Black Alicanto**\nBlack Alicanto is financially-motivated, and has been active\nsince at least 2018, targeting cryptocurrency organisations\nand entities in the financial services sector. While this threat\nactor often used lure documents themed around employee\npromotions or bonuses to induce targets into opening the\npayload, between September and December 2021 we\nobserved Black Alicanto using lure documents presenting\njob descriptions for roles in companies in the finance and\ncryptocurrency sectors, including Goldman Sachs, J.P.\nMorgan, Commerz AG, SALT Lending, and Blockchain\nIntelligence Group.[88]\n\nBlack Alicanto initially sends targets spear phishing emails\nwith attached compressed archives. These typically contain\ndouble-extension documents (.LNK files masquerading\nas Word or PDF documents) or, password-protected lure\ndocuments and malicious LNK files called Password.txt.lnk.\nThe link files abuse Bit.ly URL-shortened links to lead the\ntarget to download malicious scripts from domains registered\nby the threat actor. Black Alicanto is careful to ensure that\nonly actual targets, as opposed to security researchers,\nreceive its payloads, and manually deploys later-stage\npayloads only to those.\n\nOne such payload is msoRAT[89, 90], a remote access trojan\n(RAT) that Black Alicanto manually deploys on victim systems\nof particular interest. msoRAT is an evolution of a backdoor\nthat has been used for years by BlueNoroff.[91, 92]\n\n**Black Dev 2**\nSince at least August 2020, we tracked a cluster of activity\nthat we initially referred to as Black Dev 2[93], primarily\ntargeting entities in the cryptocurrency and financial\ntechnology (FinTech) space, as well as venture capital\n(VC) firms, particularly ones funding cryptocurrency- and\ntechnology-related ventures.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 19: Geographic distribution of entities targeted by Black Dev 2**\n\n**Malta**\n\n**Cayman Islands**\n\n**UAE**\n\n**Singapore**\n\nAt least 1 targeted entity At least 4 targeted entities\n\nSource: PwC\n\n\n**Malta**\n\n**Cayman Islands**\n\n**UAE**\n\n**Singapore**\n\n\nCryptocurrency\n\n\nInvestments Financial Services\n\n\nThe intrusions we associated with Black Dev 2 typically\ninvolved lure documents themed around a venture capital\npresentation or company pitch, or around non-disclosure\nagreements. The lure documents fetched a malicious remote\ntemplate from a threat actor-registered domain. The remote\ntemplate’s macros would download a further payload –\ntypically a malicious backdoor and victim profiler dynamic\nlink library (DLL) - to be injected into another running process.\n\nIn timelining the creation and last modification times of\nmalicious documents created by Black Dev 2, we identified a\npattern matching that of an average working day, starting at\naround 8am and trailing off at around 6pm with a one or twohour lunch gap in the middle, matching the GMT+9 timezone,\nwhich includes North Korea.\n\n\nWe also observed Black Dev 2 using a malware family that\nis likely a variant of msoRAT, on infrastructure overlapping\nwith other msoRAT C2 servers used by Black Alicanto.[94]\nBased on the similarity in infrastructure setup and intrusion\nchains adopted by Black Dev 2 and Black Alicanto, and their\ncommon victimology, we assessed it likely that Black Dev 2\nand Black Alicanto are the same North Korea-based threat\nactor, and an evolution of Bluenoroff.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Complementary missions\n\nBeyond the imperative to continue generating funds for\nthe regime, established North Korea-based threat actors\nhave continued pursuing targets aligned with North Korean\nstrategic objectives.\n\n**Black Banshee**\nIn 2021, Black Banshee’s (aka Kimsuky, Velvet Chollima) core\nsectors of interest remained in line with the threat actor’s\nhistoric targeting, and included:\n\n- government and public sector;\n\n- diplomacy and policy, including think tanks;\n\n- \u0007academia (with particular attention to nuclear research\n\nand international policy);\n\n- defence and aerospace;\n\n- nuclear; and,\n\n- \u0007targeting of civil society and specific groups such as\n\njournalists, NGOs, and religious groups active in relation\nto North Korea.\n\n\n**The BravePrince update**\nIn 2021 we observed Black Banshee maintaining its focus\nlargely on these priorities, and revamping tools from its\nprevious arsenal in pursuit of its regional targets. For\nexample, Black Banshee developed an updated version of\nits BravePrince backdoor, and used it to target South Korean\nvictims.[95] The BravePrince backdoor acts as a victim profiler,\nkeylogger, and information stealer, exfiltrating victim data over\nthe South Korean email service Daum. The backdoor also\nhas the ability to exfiltrate specific files of interest to Black\nBanshee, suggesting not only direct operator interaction\nwith the implant, but also that the threat actor deployed the\nbackdoor specifically to targets of interest. The campaign\nfocused on South Korean entities; it likely aimed to attain\ndiplomatic, political, and military intelligence about South\nKorea’s stance in relation to North Korea, China, and Russia,\nas well as the United States. An update about this campaign\npublished in November 2021[96 ]also detailed targeting of\naerospace and defence material, as well as scientific research\nin specific fields such as aviation fuel.\n\n\n**Figure 19: Steps of a Black Banshee intrusion chain involving the BravePrince backdoor**\n\nWhat the\nvictim sees\n\n\nHollow64.txt\n\n\nFirst-stage\n\ninjector\n\n\nSecond-stage\n\ninjector\n\n\nKeylogger\n\nmodule\n\nDownloads\n\npayload if\nRDP present\n\nThird-stage\n\nmodule\n\n\nmacros Profile victim\n\n\nInject Inject if RDP\n\nabsent\n\ncmd.exe svchost.exe iexplore.exe\n\nDecrypts and injects\n\ninto rundll32.exe\n\n\nExfiltrate\n\nfile and\ndownload\n\npayloads\n\n\n-----\n\n**Nuclear policy for BabySharks**\nBlack Banshee also continued to run BabyShark campaigns\nfor the most part of the year[97], maintaining its long-standing\nfocus on nuclear, policy, and diplomacy topics. We identified\nand notified at least eight victims who Black Banshee had\ncompromised since August 2021. These included diplomatic\nfigures; current or former senior analysts at think tanks\nfocused on the Asia-Pacific region; senior academics\nfocusing on Asia-Pacific history, policy, and defence; and,\nemployees at NGOs focused on the Korean peninsula. This\ntargeting also aligned with previous campaigns operated\nby Black Banshee since at least late 2018, when we first\nobserved the threat actor starting to target individual figures\nworking at supranational organisations including the United\nNations.\n\n**Black Artemis**\nBlack Artemis (aka HIDDEN COBRA, Lazarus Group)\ncontinued heavily targeting the aerospace and defence\nsectors as part of a campaign that we track as ShowState.[98]\n\nThe campaign persisted in 2021, relying on social\nengineering and spear phishing documents themed around\njob opportunities for aerospace and defence, expanding to\ninclude engineering and manufacturing companies.[99]\n\nA different campaign by Black Artemis in 2021, which\ntargeted South Korean entities, also involved malicious\ndocuments with macros being used to achieve initial access.\nHowever, in this set of intrusions, the macros would drop to\ndisk a PNG image containing malicious data in compressed\nformat, making it harder to detect statically by antivirus\nsoftware. The macro would then convert the PNG image to\na BMP file, and execute it via mshta.exe. The embedded\nexecutable payload, a malware family we have called\nPaintJob[100], shares similarities with the encryption routine\nused by Dtrack, a well-known RAT which we attribute to the\nBlack Artemis subgroup known as Andariel.\n\nBlack Artemis also persistently targeted offensive security\nand vulnerability researchers throughout the past year. In\nJanuary 2021, Google[101 ]and Microsoft[102] reported a monthslong social engineering campaign relying on Twitter profiles\nposing as security researchers, as well as on accounts on\nLinkedIn, Telegram, Discord, and Keybase. Black Artemis\nwould reach out to targets under the false pretense of\ncollaborating on a vulnerability research project. It would then\nsend them a Visual Studio Project backdoored with malicious\ncode executing the Comebacker dropper, that would\nultimately lead to the installation of the Klackring backdoor.\n\n\nThe threat actor also maintained a security blog acting as a\nwatering hole, and would direct targeted security researchers\nto it during conversation. When the targets visited the site,\na 0-day Chrome exploit would lead to a malicious service\nbeing installed on their machine, together with an in-memory\nbackdoor. Black Artemis could then exploit the access it had\ngained to security researcher systems to identify and steal\noffensive security research of interest.\n\nA parallel effort by Black Artemis included specific targeting\nof Chinese offensive security researchers with Chineselanguage malicious lure documents.[103] Compromise attempts\nagainst security researchers also involved a trojanized\nversion of IDA Pro[104 ]- disassembly software widely used\nin cybersecurity research and particularly in vulnerability\nanalysis and exploit development.\n\n#### A year of China-based threat actor activity\n\n###### Planning ahead\n\nWe have continued to observe significant China-based\nthreat actor activity. Some of these threat actors, like Red\nDjinn, are focusing on specific industry sectors such as\nsemiconductors, artificial intelligence, healthcare (which\nincludes genetic research and biotechnology), quantum\ncomputing, and exploration across space, maritime, and\npolar arenas.[105] Others like Red Kelpie are pursuing (and in\nsome instances enabling others to conduct) significantly\nbroader targeting.\n\nBeyond economic strategic objectives, we also continued to\nobserve espionage-motivated activity focused against the\npublic sector; Red Vulture (aka Ke3chang, APT15, APT25,\nNICKEL) and Red Keres (aka APT31, ZIRCONIUM) are both\nprominent examples of this kind of targeting focus.\n\n**Red Djinn**\nThe China-based threat actor that we track as Red Djinn (aka\nBlackTech, Mobwork, Palmerworm) remained active in 2021,\nusing known tools (such as PLEAD and TSCookie), and new\nones (such as Consock, FlagPro and SpiderRAT).\n\n\n-----\n\nIn early 2021, we observed a series of Red Djinn campaigns\nusing malware families known as PLEAD and TSCookie,\nincluding Linux variants of both backdoors to widen the\nvariety of systems it could target. The targeting of these\ncampaigns was on organisations based in parts of Asia, and\nincluded an IT and telecommunications company. The threat\nactor registered domains themed around cloud and VPN\ntechnologies, and the malware families contained campaign\nIDs likely indicating the targeting of the manufacturing and\nengineering sectors.\n\n\n**New Djinn**\nWhile Red Djinn has historically and consistently focused on\ntargeting Asia’s largest economies, we have also previously\nobserved broader targeting by the threat actor. For example,\nthe threat actor previously targeted an overseas subsidiary\nof a managed service provider (MSP) to perform an ‘islandhopping’ attack to laterally move to the MSP’s main network.\n\nThrough our tracking of Consock[106, 107], a custom Gh0stRAT\nvariant associated with Red Djinn (also known as\nGh0stTimes) we were able to identify the malware’s controller.\n\n\n**Figure 20: Times.exe, the controller for Red Djinn’s Consock malware**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 21: Times.exe was originally designed for**\n**Chinese-language systems**\n\nWe also uncovered spear phishing lures used by the threat\nactor to deliver both Consock, and also a new malware\nfamily which we named Flagpro.[108] We assess that Red Djinn\nhighly likely used Flagpro in its targeting of the subsidiary\nof a Japanese IT Services provider and software developer\noperating across East and South Asia.\n\nIn our analysis of that campaign, we identified a series of\nexploit scripts which we assess were highly likely being\nused by Red Djinn for its operations. Metadata revealed\nsome of them to have probably been taken or adapted\nfrom open vulnerability databases, such as Seebug. These\nwere accompanied by folders containing data suggesting\nthat Red Djinn had been performing reconnaissance for\nvulnerable systems on an international scale. In addition,\nwe identified exploit code for Citrix and Mikrotik appliances\nthat appeared to be still in development.[109 ]We also identified\nRed Djinn activity dating back to March 2021, exploiting the\nProxyLogon vulnerabilities, after their initial disclosure, to\ndeploy a new backdoor which we call SpiderRAT.[110, 111]\n\n**Red Vulture**\nRed Vulture ramped up its operational tempo throughout\n2021. We observed Red Vulture conducting regular\nreconnaissance on a variety of organisations across the year,\nacross the following sectors:\n\n- Government;\n\n- Aerospace and Defence;\n\n- Education; and,\n\n- NGOs.\n\n\nThis reconnaissance mainly consisted of the threat actor\nbrowsing the websites and perimeter services (e.g. VPN,\nemail) of targeted organisations. There has been evidence\nthat the threat actor is mass scanning for vulnerabilities\nin public facing infrastructure.[112] Red Vulture’s success in\ntargeting victims in 2021 was often due to its prolific use of\nexploits against perimeter authentication systems (e.g. VPNs).\n\nThe observed reconnaissance was focused around the\ntargeting of Ministries of Foreign Affairs (MFAs), with a\nconsistent focus on Europe and South America.[113, 114,] [115]\n\n**Red Keres**\nIn early 2021, the German Federal Office for the Protection\nof the Constitution (BfV) reported on Red Keres’ targeting of\ninstitutions including “ministries and authorities, political\norganisations and foundations” across Europe.[116]\n\nAnalysing Red Keres infrastructure disclosed by the BfV, we\nalso identified evidence suggesting that the threat actor had\nlikely compromised, and was directly accessing, the email\nserver of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of a Southeast Asian\ngovernment between at least December 2020 and February\n2021.[117 ]Around the same time, we observed similar activity\ninvolving the email server for the Ministry of Defence of a\ndifferent Southeast Asian government.\n\nIn late 2021, France’s Agence Nationale de la Sécurité des\nSystèmes d’Information (ANSSI) released a detailed report\ninto Red Keres TTPs. The report detailed the threat actor’s\nmultilayered anonymisation infrastructure set-up, involving\nover a thousand Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) routers,\na technique PwC has observed multiple other China based\nthreat actors invest in throughout 2021. The report also\nhighlighted the many different techniques that Red Keres\ndeploys when attempting to gain initial access to a victim,\nranging from spear phishing, to password brute-forcing and\nabuse of valid credentials, to exploitation of vulnerabilities\nsuch as ProxyLogon or in Virtual Private Network (VPN)\nproducts.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Red Kelpie**\nThe threat actor that we track as Red Kelpie (which has\noverlaps with APT41 and BARIUM) relies on a wide variety of\nmalware families including ShadowPad and CROSSWALK, as\nwell as commodity tools like Cobalt Strike. It is prolific in its\ntargeting, which encompasses several strategically\nimportant sectors.\n\n\n**ChaChaLoader**\nIn 2021, Red Kelpie conducted a series of campaigns using\nthe threat actor’s well-known loader Motnug, and a likely\nevolution called ChaChaLoader. Motnug and ChaChaLoader\nwere used to load Cobalt Strike, and in some rare cases,\na newly observed backdoor which has been called\nSIDEWALK in open source, and which is a likely evolution\nof the CROSSWALK backdoor.[118 ]It is plausible that the few\ncases where SIDEWALK was deployed instead of\nCobaltStrike were for high-value targets.\n\nThese campaigns targeted a variety of sectors including\nfinancial services, retail, telecommunications, manufacturing,\nand aviation.\n\n\n**Figure 22: Red Kelpie targeting in 2021**\n\nFinancial Services Retail Telecommunications Manufacturing Aviation\n\n\n-----\n\n**Confluence vulnerability**\nIn prior years, Red Kelpie has mass-exploited vulnerabilities\nin public facing infrastructure to gain initial access, a tactic\nthat we also noted in 2021. In particular, we observed Red\nKelpie exploiting the Atlassian Confluence code execution\nvulnerability CVE-2021-26084 to drop a batch script and DLL\nused to load and execute Cobalt Strike.[119 ]Red Kelpie has\npreviously been observed using exploits for vulnerabilities\nin Citrix/Cisco software to deploy very similar batch scripts,\nwhich are also known to load and execute Cobalt Strike.[120]\n\n**Active, despite indictments**\nIn September 2020, the US Justice Department indicted\nseven individuals based in Asia alleging that these\nindividuals were computer hackers, and that the intrusions\nthey conducted were referred to in open source as APT41,\nBARIUM, Winnti, and so on.[121]\n\n\nDespite these indictments, Red Kelpie activity continued\nthroughout 2021. Perhaps the bigger cost to Red Kelpie due\nto the indictment was the seizing of accounts, servers, and\ndomains being utilised by the threat actor, which forced it\nto change some of its operational tempo. We have tracked\nnew sets of infrastructure being used by this threat actor\nacross late-2020/2021, yet have still observed overlaps with\nolder associated infrastructure attributed to that of APT41/\nBARIUM. The indictments of several of the operators behind\nthe campaigns do not seem to have had any significant\noverall impact on the threat actor’s operations.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Incident response case study:**\n### Red Dev 14’s FUNRUN\n\n\nPwC responded to an intrusion into a think tank by a\nChina-based threat actor, which we identified as Red Dev\n14.[122 ]Using the ProxyLogon exploits, the threat actor\ndropped a webshell onto an on-premises Exchange server.\nInitially, the threat actor attempted some reconnaissance\nvia the webshell (mainly consisting of gathering system\ninformation like usernames and running processes), and\nran commands to dump the memory of LSASS to obtain\ncredentials via living-off-the-land binaries. The threat actor\nthen utilised a variant of the backdoor called FUNRUN, which\nit used to drop ProcDump to dump the LSASS memory, as\nwell as dropping Mimikatz to disk.\n\nAfter successfully obtaining credentials, the threat actor\nmoved laterally in the network via SMB remote shares,\ninstalling the FUNRUN backdoor to additional hosts. The\nthreat actor also ran commands to search for other webshells\non the Exchange server. This was likely done to test whether\nthe Exchange server had already been compromised (likely\n\n\nby ProxyLogon), which would inform Red Dev 14 if another\nthreat actor was also present on the system. This has the\npotential to affect how it would achieve its goals.\n\nFrom an attribution standpoint, we had previously observed\nthe FUNRUN backdoor being used by the China-based\nthreat actor we track as Red Pegasus (aka APT9).[123 ]However,\na large amount of time has passed between when Red\nPegasus was last observed using this backdoor (during 2014\nand 2015), and the 2021 FUNRUN activity we observed.\nBased on this consideration, as well as on the fact that the\nloading mechanism was different for this backdoor compared\nto Red Pegasus’ usage, and that there were no infrastructure\noverlaps with Red Pegasus, we decided to track this activity\nunder the new name Red Dev 14.\n\n\n**Red Dev 14 compromised victims in multiple geographies as part of this campaign, primarily in agricultural sector.**\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Call me, maybe: China-based threat actors targeting telecommunications\n\nTargeting of the telecommunications sector continues to be a\nfocus for multiple China-based threat actors. Organisations in\nthis sector hold a variety of high value information, including\ndata from a telecommunications provider on its customers\n(which, depending on the provider, may be metadata around\nconnections to websites, or call logs). This kind of information\ncan then be exploited by threat actors for surveillance\npurposes, or to gather traditional intelligence about the\nactivities of specific targets.\n\nFor example, as described above, we continued to see Red\nKelpie targeting the telecommunications sector,[124] as well\nas the shared tool ShadowPad being used to compromise\ntelecommunications providers.[125] We supported an incident\nresponse investigation to a telecommunications provider\nin Southeast Asia, where we observed a variant of the\nEvora backdoor used by the China-based threat actor Red\nSalamander (aka LotusBlossom).[126]\n\n#### Some things change, and some things stay the same for India-based threat actors\n\nFrom our investigations into India-based threat actor\noperations, we continue to see a narrow focus on countries\nof strategic relevance to India, particularly on its nearneighbours, China and Pakistan. We observed almost all\nIndia-based espionage threat actors that we track using lure\ndocuments related to policy or political affairs of targeted\ncountries, or otherwise themed around military and defence\ntopics.\n\n**Orange Kala (Donot)**\nOrange Kala (aka Donot) maintained similar operational\ntempo and targeting focus in 2021 as in the previous year,\nwith little variance in TTPs. In at least one case, the threat\nactor used a lure document related to missile technology.[127]\nThis lure topic was not new for Orange Kala, as the content of\nseveral other lure documents since at least November 2020\nwas taken from both news articles and journals focusing\nheavily on missile defence technology. However, while most\nof the previous lure documents on this topic related to the\nUnited States, this campaign was the first instance where\nPwC observed Orange Kala focusing on missile technology i\n\n\n###### Case study: Red Menshen targeting telecommunications providers\n\nThroughout 2021 we tracked and responded\nto multiple intrusions attributed to a Chinabased threat actor that we have named\nRed Menshen.[128 ]This threat actor has been\nobserved targeting telecommunications\nproviders across the Middle East and\nAsia, as well as entities in the government,\neducation, and logistics sectors using a\ncustom backdoor we refer to as BPFDoor.\nThis backdoor supports multiple protocols for\ncommunicating with a C2 including TCP, UDP,\nand ICMP allowing the threat actor a variety\nof mechanisms to interact with the implant.\n\nOur research has shown that this threat actor\nuses a variety of tools in its post-exploitation\nphase. This includes custom variants of the\nshared tool Mangzamel (including Golang\nvariants), custom variants of Gh0st, and open\nsource tools like Mimikatz and Metasploit to\naid in its lateral movement across Windows\nsystems.[129, 130 ]We also identified that the\nthreat actor sends commands to BPFDoor\nvictims via Virtual Private Servers (VPSs)\nhosted at a well-known provider, and that\nthese VPSs, in turn, are administered via\ncompromised routers based in Taiwan, which\nthe threat actor uses as VPN tunnels.\n\nMost Red Menshen activity that we observed\ntook place between Monday to Friday (with\nnone observed on the weekends), with most\ncommunication taking place between 01:00\nand 10:00 UTC.[131 ]This pattern suggests a\nconsistent 8 to 9-hour activity window for\nthe threat actor, with realistic probability of it\naligning to local working hours.\n\n\n-----\n\nMalware-as-a-Service (MaaS) tool WarzoneRAT. In one\ncampaign, the threat actor deployed WarzoneRAT through\na malicious DLL that would ultimately decode and execute\na long series of hardcoded command-line commands in\na batch script.[132] Some lure documents involved in that\ncampaign, and uploaded to an online multi-antivirus scanner\nfrom the UAE, were themed around new vessels in the Iranian\nNavy, and some around multinational naval exercises hosted\nby Pakistan, suggesting the threat actor’s likely interest in\nmilitary themes.\n\n**Sharing is caring**\nOver the year, we observed several crossovers in TTPs\nbetween Orange Kala and other India-based threat actors\nwhich we are still investigating, but which could be indicative\nof a greater degree of interconnection among India-based\nthreat actors than had previously been considered. During\nFebruary 2021, we tracked a campaign[133] involving a\nmalicious RTF file template with links to both Orange Kala\nand Orange Dev 1 (aka CONFUCIUS) operations in 2020.[134]\n\nLinks were also identified as far back as a 2017 campaign\ntargeting Pakistan and known as Operation Shaheen[135 ]The\n2021 activity centred on military and defence themes, with\nlure documents making reference to defence proposals, and,\nin one case, to the Royal Thai Navy. Orange Kala and Orange\nDev 1 have both been known to target the defence and\ngovernment sectors in the past. The 2021 campaign used\ndifferent techniques from the similar activity reported in\n2020[136], adding an extra layer into the attack chain, with the\ninitial RTF documents downloading a second RTF on the\nvictim machine, and using that second RTF as a downloader\nfor a malicious DLL.\n\nIn June 2021, we observed a campaign by Orange Athos\n(aka Patchwork) involving VBA scripts that we had previously\nobserved being used by Orange Kala as early as 2019.[137 ]\n\nThe VBA macros were strikingly similar in the 2019 and\n2021 activity, down to unique variable names; this suggests\nwith realistic probability that they were not the product of a\nmacro builder, but bespoke macros created by a threat actor\nand repurposed by another. While the malicious document\nwas modelled after a Pakistani individual’s biography taken\nfrom Scribd.com, the threat actor altered the original text to\nclaim that the individual’s father used to work for the Space\nand Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (SUPARCO),\n\n\nthe national space agency of Pakistan. The document was\nused to deliver the BADNEWS backdoor, a long-standing\nstaple in Orange Athos’ arsenal, to victims. Other open\nsource reports[138, 139 ]earlier in the year had discussed further\nmalicious lure documents themed around SUPARCO; these\ndelivered WarzoneRAT to targets and were attributed to Indiabased threat actor Orange Dev 1.\n\nThese campaigns display at least some modicum of shared\ntooling, or of cross-adaptation of simple tools, between\nIndia-based threat actors. However, we note we have only\nobserved this at the level of initial access vectors, with Indiabased threat actors still largely differing in their choice of\nlater-stage backdoors.\n\n**Orange Athos (Patchwork)**\nOrange Athos (aka Patchwork) continued to make heavy\nuse of the BADNEWS backdoor (also known as BozokRAT)\nthroughout different campaigns in 2021, with only minor\nchanges to the malware’s codebase since it was first reported\non in open source as far back as 2016.[140]\n\nThe threat actor maintained its previous focus[141 ]on Chinese\nand Pakistani targets. In a campaign we observed in April\n2021, the threat actor used a lure document relating to\nmilitary cooperation between China and Pakistan.[142 ]The\ndocument was a malicious DOCX file exploiting CVE2017-0261, a Use-After-Free (UAF) vulnerability pertaining\nspecifically to encapsulated postscript (EPS) images. This is a\ntechnique that we had observed the threat actor consistently\nrely on in several 2020 campaigns involving nearly identical\ntools, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), each with a focus\non China-based targets.\n\nAmong separate intrusions, one[143 ]featured a lure purporting\nto be a form by the Federal Board of Revenue of Pakistan,\nasking employees of Pakistani federal government\ndepartments to input their personal details to be eligible\nto receive a special tax relief package. When victims\nopened the RTF, the same vulnerability mentioned above\n(CVE-2017-0261) would lead to the installation of the\nBADNEWS backdoor. With the continued exploitation of the\nspecific vulnerability, and use of tooling that has been well\ndocumented in open source, it appears this is another threat\nactor that will persist with tried and tested TTPs.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Orange Yali (BITTER)**\nThroughout 2021, we identified several websites purporting\nto be legitimate Pakistani companies that we believe were\nmost likely set up and maintained by India-based threat actor\nOrange Yali (aka BITTER) since 2020. The websites, which\ntypically have little to no content or placeholder text, were\nused to stage payloads of the “rkftl” backdoor, sometimes\npackaged as an MSI installer, as well as utilities, such as the\nSSH and Telnet client PuTTY. Orange Yali also continued\nto use the malware family known as ArtraDownloader,\nand introduced the use of CHM (compiled HTML) files in a\ncampaign specifically targeting Chinese entities.[144, 145] Several\nreports also indicated that Orange Yali used at least two\ndifferent 0-day exploits[146, 147 ]throughout 2021, both of which\nwere quite likely acquired from an exploit broker as opposed\nto developed in-house by the threat actor.[148 ]This indicates\nthat at least one India-based, espionage-motivated threat\nactor has the resources to access the private 0-day market,\nsomething which we had not previously observed from threat\nactors active in the region.\n\n#### Espionage doesn’t pay: Pakistan-based threat\n actor activity\n\nThroughout 2021, Green Havildar (aka APT36, Transparent\nTribe, Gorgon Group) primarily continued operating in\nline with its likely main objective of gathering intelligence\n(including targeting of the military, government, and wider\npublic sector, particularly in India). This threat actor relies on\nbasic spear phishing for initial access, with lure documents\nvarying from individuals’ curriculum vitaes to conference\nprogrammes, to several samples related to military and\ndefence.[149]\n\nGreen Havildar is known for its use of CrimsonRAT, which\nit continued to operate through a builder model: the RAT\nhas a wide set of surveillance and exfiltration capabilities,\n\n\na consistent code obfuscation model, and the ability for\nthe threat actor to flexibly change the ports over which C2\nactivity is conducted. Between April and July 2021, Team\nCymru published reports exposing the setup of Green\nHavildar’s C2 infrastructure, including the threat actor’s\nmanagement of it over RDP.[150, 151]\n\nIn 2021, we observed increased activity by Green Havildar’s\nfinancially-motivated, cybercrime-focused operations\n(reported in open source under the moniker Gorgon Group\naka Aggah, MasterMana). As in 2020, the majority of Gorgon\nGroup’s spam campaigns involved PowerPoint document\nlures, and OneDrive links, delivering commodity RATs such as\nAgentTesla, Remcos, and Quasar. We additionally observed\nthe use of two separate common injectors by the threat actor\nRunPE and HCrypt.\n\nWhile Gorgon Group is also known to host multistage\nmalicious scripts on public paste sites such as Pastebin\nand Blogspot, we also tracked a series of campaigns using\naccounts on The Internet Archive for similar purposes. In\nAugust 2021, it was reported[152] that Gorgon Group was\nusing compromised websites to stage next-stage malicious\npayloads and delivering Warzone RAT in place of paste sites,\nin an effort to avoid detection and takedown of its staged\ncapabilities.[153]\n\nWhile Green Havildar’s intelligence gathering operations\nfocus primarily on India as well as occasionally on\nneighboring countries like Afghanistan[154], Gorgon Group’s\nactivity has an international reach not necessarily limited to\npolitical considerations. For example, from April 2021 we\ntracked a Gorgon Group campaign targeting organisations\nin the Netherlands and South Korea[155], including in the\nmanufacturing sector (a frequent target of this threat actor).\nIn contrast to Green Havildar, Gorgon Group is relatively\nindiscriminate in its targeting, and we have not observed it\ndeploying any custom capabilities.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### (Not) all is quiet on the\n Scarlet front: Vietnam-based threat actor activity\n\nFollowing Facebook’s public attribution in December 2020 of\nScarlet Ioke (aka Ocean Lotus, APT32) to CyberOne Group, a\nVietnam-based IT company, we observed a drastic reduction\nin the threat actor’s operational tempo – at least with regards\nto known, ongoing campaigns. On the other hand, Chinese\ncybersecurity firms continued observing Scarlet Ioke\ntargeting China over the past year, which is consistent with\n\n\nthe threat actor’s long-standing targeting focus. For example,\nSangfor[156 ]reported in March on Scarlet Ioke activity using\na loader commonly referred to as “DgBase.dll”. The Linux\nRotaJakiro[157 ]backdoor, which is also equipped with botnet\nfunctionality, was also attributed in open source to Scarlet\nIoke, based on close code overlaps between RotaJakiro and\nthe OceanLotus backdoor.\n\nBetween late 2020 and September 2021, we observed a\ncampaign[158 ]involving DLL loaders for Cobalt Strike and\nMetaSploit which used several layers of Shikata Ga Nai\nencoding to avoid detection. In some cases, the Cobalt Strike\npayloads used the Glitch web service to conduct C2 activity.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn at least one case, the DLL was sideloaded by a legitimate\nKingsoft binary, a software predominately used in Mandarin\nChinese-speaking countries. Furthermore, many of the Cobalt\nStrike samples that we identified were masquerading as\nTencent’s QQ service or as the Chinese search engine Sogou,\na consistent tactic for Scarlet Ioke. This evidence suggests\nwith realistic probability that the binaries were meant to target\nChinese-speaking victims. Based on the TTPs and targeting\nthat we observed in this campaign, we assess it is a realistic\nprobability that it was conducted by Scarlet Ioke. Factors\ncontradicting this assessment include the lack of direct links\nto previous Scarlet Ioke activity, as well as the use of typical\npenetration testing tools that could also be part of a domestic\nred team exercise.\n\nUltimately, threat actors respond differently to disclosure and\nattribution. Some, like Red Kelpie and Yellow Garuda, might\ncontinue operations with no alteration to their TTPs, while\nothers may change tools and techniques or even undergo\nradical restructuring. Based on the observations\nwe assess it unlikely that Scarlet Ioke has ceased\noperations. Rather, we assess it is likely that the threat\nactor is retooling and reorganizing, with plans to ramp\nup activity in new campaigns.\n\n\n###### Threat actors respond differently to public disclosure of their activity. Some, like Red Kelpie and Yellow Garuda, continue operations with little to no changes to their TTPs, while others (possibly including Scarlet Ioke) may change tools and techniques, or even undergo radical restructuring.”\n\n\n-----\n\n### Middle East\n\n#### Iran-based threat activity\n\n###### The changing face of sabotage operations\n\nIran-based threat actors have a long history of conducting\nsabotage attacks meant to destroy and disrupt victim\norganisations. Such attacks put the threat actors squarely\nunder the spotlight, typically leading to attribution and\nscrutiny of their operations by the private and public sectors\nalike. In an attempt to mitigate unwanted attention, Iranbased threat actors often blame or pose as hacktivist\ncollectives, a tactic that continues to be adopted by\nsuspected Iran-based threat actors such as White Dev 95\n(aka Moses Staff).[159]\n\n\nFirst emerging in late 2020 and rising to prominence in 2021,\nwe observed a theme of Iran-based threat actors amplifying\nfalse motivation tactics, including Yellow Dev 15’s Pay2Key\nand N3tw0rm activity leveraging ransomware for sabotage\nrather than financial gain.[160 ]When used in conjunction with\nhacktivist behaviours, this can work to sow confusion about a\nthreat actor’s true nature and intentions.\n\nIran-based threat actors such as Yellow Dev 15 and Yellow\nDev 21 have also at times masqueraded as cyber criminals\nrather than hacktivists in their sabotage campaigns, where\nthey also pretended to extort their victims.[161 ]On one\noccasion, Yellow Dev 21 threatened to sell a victim’s data to\nthird parties if a payment was not made.[162]\n\n\nPwC observed the following suspected Iran-based threat actors, with varying levels of confidence, leverage ransomware in\ntheir campaigns:\n\n\n**September 2020: Thanos**\nransomware activity attributed\nto White Dev 98 (aka\nTarnishedGauntlet, DEV-0146)\n\n**November 2020 - December 2020: Yellow Dev**\n15 attributed “Pay2Key” campaign (aka Pioneer\nKitten, UNC757, RUBIDIUM)\n\n**November 2020 - November 2021: Yellow**\nDev 21 attributed “BlackShadow” campaign\n(aka Agrius, UNC2428)[163]\n\n\n**October 2021 – November 2021:**\n“Moses Staff” campaign attributed\n\nto White Dev 95 (aka DEV-0500)\n\nYellow Dev 24 observed using BitLocker\nas well as conducting widespread internet\nscanning for victims (aka Nemesis Kitten, a\n\n[164]\n\nYellow Dev 15 attributed\n“N3tw0rm” campaign (aka Pioneer Kitten,\n\n**September 2021: attack conducted**\nby Yellow Dev 21, under a ransomware\n\noperator persona named “DarKrypt”\n\n|r 2020 - Dec ed “Pay2Key C757, RUBI r 2020 - Nov ributed “Bla s, UNC2428)|ember 2020 ” campaign DIUM) ember 2021 ckShadow” c 163|: Yellow Dev (aka Pioneer : Yellow ampaign|Col4|April 2021 Yellow Dev as well as scanning f part of PH April 2021 “N3tw0rm UNC757,|Col6|Col7|Col8|October 20 “Moses Sta to White|21 – Novem ff” campaign Dev 95 (aka|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n||||||– Novembe 24 observe conducting or victims (a OSPHORUS : Yellow Dev ” campaign ( RUBIDIUM)|r 2021: d using BitL widespread i ka Nemesis )164 15 attribute aka Pioneer|ocker nternet Kitten, a d Kitten,|||\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Case study: Moses Staff\n\nStarting in September 2021, a threat actor calling itself “Moses Staff’’ started a destructive “lock and leak”\ncampaign against Israeli organisations. We track the threat actor behind this campaign as White Dev 95. The\nmajority of the campaign’s victims observed in late 2021 were Israeli organisations whose business footprints\ndo not align to the threat actor’s mission statement exposing various crimes allegedly committed by the Israeli\nGovernment. They also span a diverse range of sectors: legal, logistics, retail, utilities, professional services,\ntransport, construction, manufacturing, and financial services. This victimology suggests that targets were\nlikely chosen somewhat opportunistically, with the focus solely on Israel as a target rather than on exposing\nany alleged wrongdoing.\n\nWhite Dev 95 also displayed multiple similarities with a number of Israel-focused campaigns attributed to\nIran-based threat actors that have taken place across 2021, and which specifically sought public attention in\nan attempt to build momentum towards their activities. To that effect, White Dev 95 operates multiple digital\nplatforms to leak victim data, as well as directly engaging with them over Twitter. One of the key differentiators\nbetween the “Moses Staff’’ campaign and similar operations by Iran-based threat actors, is that White Dev\n95 skips the extortion phase of its attacks, preferring instead to leak stolen data without warning. This likely\ncontributes to the confusion caused to victims, maximising the destructive element of the campaign.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### You can’t teach an old threat actor new TTPs\n\nThe majority of Iran-based threat actors that we track\nemerged with new flavours of tooling this past year, while also\ncontinuing to rely on tried and tested techniques. Iran-based\nthreat actors are often known for their use of open source\ntooling, particularly offensive security tools, as well as for\ntheir social engineering campaigns.\n\n**Open source tools**\nYellow Nix (aka Static Kitten, MERCURY, MuddyWater)\nleveraged commercial remote administration tools\nconsistently throughout 2021, including ConnectWise\nControl (aka ScreenConnect) and Remote Utilities, in order\nto gain initial access to victims.[167] We also saw Yellow\nNix intermittently using macro-enabled Microsoft Office\ndocuments, including using them as a delivery mechanism for\nConnectWise Control.[168]\n\nBoth Yellow Dev 24[169 ]and Yellow Dev 15[170 ]have used the\nopen-source FRP tool, which allows a system to provide\nnetwork access to threat actor-controlled systems located\noutside of the victim network. Similarly, Yellow Orc (aka\nAPT 33, Refined Kitten, Stonedrill) is well known for its use\nof PoshC2, an open source C2 framework used for postexploitation and lateral movement. In 2021, we observed\nnew Yellow Orc activity, which incorporated a similar publicly\navailable C2 framework.[171]\n\n\n**Social engineering**\nA common denominator among many Iran-based threat\nactors is to use job or recruitment themed phishing\nlures, while relying on social media platforms to directly\ncommunicate and build trust with targets. In several fringe\ncases, phishing and social engineering techniques bypassed\nmulti-factor authentication (MFA); however, from our\nobservations, MFA remains highly effective in thwarting\nthe majority of attacks.[172]\n\nYellow Maero (aka APT34, OilRig, COBALT GYPSY) has\na long history of social engineering; in January 2021, we\nobserved it using a recruitment brochure branded as a\nlegitimate US-based IT services provider and advertising a\nrange of different IT, business, and engineering roles available\nin the Middle East.[173 ]The lure document is likely legitimate,\nthough it was maliciously repurposed by the threat actor.\n\nIn July, the threat actor we track as Yellow Orc (aka APT33,\nElfin) conducted a campaign involving job lures and a fake\ncareer finder website for positions primarily in the Middle\nEast, with a focus on the following sectors: Oil & Gas,\nChemicals, Energy, Life Sciences, Manufacturing, Mining,\nInfrastructure, and Government.[174 ]Open directory contents\nalso show the threat actor likely began the year focusing\non US targeting via malicious HTA files, and simultaneously\nconducted an operation leveraging a piece of malware that\nmasqueraded as a COVID-19 tracker from the World Health\nOrganization (WHO).[175] The open directory evidenced that\nYellow Orc likely also used images of a female individual to\nsocially engineer its targets.[176 ]The images bear resemblance\nto open source reporting on the “Marcella Flores” persona\noperated by the threat actor we track as Yellow Liderc.[177]\nYellow Orc has been using job themed social engineering\ntactics since at least 2017.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Broadening horizons\n\n**Yellow Nix**\nYellow Nix continued to broaden its horizons beyond the\ngeographic regions neighbouring Iran. Following a busy year\nin 2020, when it targeted Europe in multiple campaigns, in\nSeptember 2021 we saw the threat actor shifting towards\nSoutheast Asia. Its targeting of government, aviation, and\ntelecommunications sectors in Malaysia, in particular,\nfollowed economic cooperation talks held between Iranian\nand Malaysian officials.[183 ]This is typically the case with\nYellow Nix, with its activity often closely mirroring Iran’s\npolitical and trade investments. Yellow Nix also appeared to\ndirect increased levels of interest towards the aviation sector.\n\n\nIn September 2020, the United States sanctioned individuals\nassociated with Yellow Mimas, a threat actor notorious for\ntargeting global aviation and telecommunications sectors\nin order to monitor traveller movements. Since then, PwC\nanalysts have not observed Yellow Mimas activity, and\nthe threat actor has also been notably absent in open\nsource threat reporting. It remains unclear if Yellow Mimas\nhas entered a period of inactivity, but Yellow Nix’s uptick\nin targeting aviation organisations demonstrates that its\nsponsor’s requirement to obtain intelligence from this sector\nis likely being fulfilled, although the extent which Yellow Nix\nachieves this remains unclear. Yellow Nix’s recent victimology\nalso mirrors that of Yellow Mimas, and indicates that Yellow\nNix may be engaged in conducting surveillance on individuals\nof interest.[184]\n\n\n-----\n\n**Yellow Dev 9**\nFirst reported on by open sources in 2019, espionagemotivated Yellow Dev 9 (aka Lyceum, Siamese Kitten) shares\nsimilarities in its victimology, infrastructure, and tooling with\nanother Iran-based threat actor we track as Yellow Maero.\nYellow Dev 9 continued to be active in 2021 targeting\nAfrican telecommunication and aviation sectors, socially\nengineering targets over LinkedIn, and hosting its recruitment\nthemed malware on domains masquerading as information\ntechnology companies.[185 ]Despite multiple security\nresearchers releasing public reports on Yellow Dev 9, the\nthreat actor continued to develop new variants of malware,\ntermed “Milan” and “Shark” backdoors, which use HTTP and\nDNS network connectivity. Yellow Dev 9’s infrastructure has a\nspecific pattern, with the threat actor consistently registering\ncommand and control (C2) domains with DNS-, “update”,\nand CDN-themed names during 2021.[186] Yellow Dev 9 is\nknown to reuse its historic infrastructure from its earlier\ncampaigns.[187]\n\n**Yellow Garuda**\nOne of the most active and widely reported threat actors\nthis past year was Yellow Garuda (aka Charming Kitten,\nPHOSPHORUS, ITG18). This threat actor is highly capable\nand persistent, increasing its operational tempo in 2021 while\nmaintaining a sprawling network of phishing infrastructure.\nYellow Garuda’s campaigns range from simple credential\nphishing[188] to compromising legitimate websites,[189] deploying\nmobile malware,[190] using Telegram bots to fingerprint victim\ndevices,[191] and doubling-down on social engineering efforts.\n\nThese operations translate into widespread targeting of\nvictims around the globe and across multiple sectors.\nVictimology throughout 2021 included internal target sets\nwithin Iran, as well as neighboring countries throughout the\nMiddle East, and typical targets in both the US and Europe.\n\n**Yellow Dev 19**\nAn Iran-based threat actor, which PwC tracks as Yellow\nDev 19, was observed targeting websites related to the\n2020 United States presidential election, in what the US\ngovernment assesses was an attempt to influence and\ninterfere with the election.[192] We assessed in May 2021 that\nYellow Dev 19 was likely closely associated with the Iranian\neducation sector, specifically in the form of a student or\nfaculty member, which a November 2021 US indictment\nsupports with the naming of two individuals aged 23-26[193].\nWe also identified that Yellow Dev 19 likely is interested in\ntargeting Saudi Arabian government entities.[194]\n\n\nAccording to the US government indictment, the alleged\ncompany responsible for leading the attempted campaign\nis Emennet Pasargad, a company acting in support\nof the Iranian government.[195 ]PwC analysts have also\nobserved overlaps between this company, together with\nits sanctioned board members, and Yellow Liderc.[196] PwC\nassesses that Emennet Pasargad and/or its personnel is\nlikely involved in other operations, such as ransomware for\nsabotage purposes, and is closely aligned with the Islamic\nRevolutionary Guard Corps.\n\n**Yellow Dev 24**\nSpanning from at least April to November 2021, PwC\nobserved Yellow Dev 24 (aka Nemesis Kitten, a part of\nPHOSPHORUS) mass-scanning internet facing appliances,\nincluding Fortinet devices and Microsoft Exchange servers.[197]\nIn some cases, Yellow Dev 24 subsequently deployed\nransomware via BitLocker, while relying on open source\ntooling and living-off-the-land techniques. Yellow Dev 24 is\none of several Iran-based threat actors who are adopting\nransomware for sabotage purposes, while simultaneously\ncapable of conducting espionage activity. Yellow Dev 24 is\nalso opportunistic in its targeting selection, which makes this\nthreat actor relevant to a global audience.[198]\n\nVictims in this campaign were geographically diverse, and\nincluded organisations in the US, Australia, the UAE, and\nSouth Africa,[199] as the threat actor reportedly compromised\nnearly 1,000 devices in just over six months.[200] Slightly\nmore targeted (though still opportunistic) activity occurred\nvia password spraying US and Israeli defence technology\ncompanies, Arabian Gulf ports of entry, and global maritime\ntransportation companies with business presence in the\nMiddle East.[201]\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Threat activity across the Middle East\n\n**Teal Dev 2**\nTurkey-based threat actor Teal Dev 2 (aka StrongPity)\ncontinued to deploy its well-known backdoor StrongPity\nthroughout 2021 although, from our observations, this activity\nslowed in the second half of the year. New Teal Dev 2 TTPs\nwere brought to light, with open source reporting showing\ninfrastructure links between StrongPity and Android malware,\nnot previously known to be part of the threat actor’s toolset,\nbut which has likely been used since at least 2019.[202 ]Based\non these observations, we assess that Teal Dev 2’s apparent\nsparing use of specific tools and techniques has likely let\nthem go undetected for several years, and is likely indicative\nof highly targeted campaigns.\n\n**Grey Karkadann**\nGrey Karkadann (aka Arid Viper, APT-C-23, and part of the\nGaza Cybergang) has continued using tried and tested\ntechniques to target entities in the Middle East region,\nwith a strong focus on Palestinian politics and PalestineIsrael relations. Over the course of 2021, this included the\ncontinued use of its Windows malware Micropsia,[203] which\nis typically accompanied by decoy documents aligning\nwith its main targeting themes. We also observed ongoing\n\n\ndevelopment of its mobile malware, which is distributed\nvia third party app stores or threat actor-controlled sites.\nOpen source reporting notes that Grey Karkadann’s arsenal\nnow includes iOS malware in addition to its known Android\nimplants.[204] The threat actor’s mobile malware contains\nextensive surveillance and stealth functionality, often\nmasquerading as legitimate applications.[205]\n\n**White Dev 21**\nIn May 2021, we observed a cluster of activity focused on\nArabic speakers with an interest in Middle East affairs.[206\n]\n\nThe activity spanned back to at least 2019, and involved\nthe use of macro-enabled documents with content covering\na broad range of news and themes related to Palestine,\nLebanon, and Iraq. This indicates that the threat actor has\nlikely targeted multiple separate victims during this campaign.\nOpen source reporting has linked this activity to a threat actor\nknown as WIRTE, and highlighted the targeting of a number\nof high profile organisations in sectors including government\nand diplomatic entities, law firms, and financial institutions\nmaking the threat actor of concern to a wide variety of\nsectors.[207] From our observations, WIRTE shares historic\ninfrastructure overlaps with White Dev 21, a threat actor\nwe observed in 2019 using election and diplomatic-relation\nthemed lures related to Egyptian and Palestinian politics,\nand which we assess to likely be an offshoot of the Gaza\nCybergang. [208, 209]\n\n\n-----\n\n### Europe and former\n Soviet Union\n\nThreat actors based in Russia continued their cyber\noperations in 2021, seeking to access confidential or\nsensitive information. This has included the targeting of\ngovernment ministries across Europe, and Russia’s near\nabroad. We saw the threat actor Blue Athena (aka Sofacy)\ntake particular interest in the mining and natural resources\nsector in Central Asia.\n\nWe also continued to see the consistent targeting of entities\nin Ukraine by the Russia-based threat actor Blue Otso.\nWe tracked Blue Otso activity targeting entities in eastern\nUkraine, in the lead-up to the Ukrainian Security Service\n(SBU) eventually unmasking several alleged Blue Otso\noperators in November 2021.\n\nAdditionally, beyond Russia-based threat actors, our\nresearch also included tracking other malicious activity. White\nTur is one example of an as-yet unattributed threat actor\nwhose interest has focused on very specific sectors and\ngeographies. Elsewhere, Georgia-based threat actor Rose\nMatsil has been observed in association with the targeting of\nmedical organisations in Russia in 2021.\n\n#### Blue Dev 5 - A ‘noble’ phisher\n\nThe Russia-based threat actor Blue Dev 5 (aka NOBELIUM[210],\nNobleBaron) was one of the most prolific and technicallysophisticated threat actors we tracked in 2021. Blue Dev\n5 demonstrated careful tradecraft and novel techniques,\nincluding compromising Microsoft cloud environments and\nexploiting trust relationships between organisations.\n\nBlue Dev 5 successfully compromised several cloud resellers\nand MSPs, leveraging cloud trust relationships held by these\norganisations with their customers to compromise customer\ncloud environments, and exploit the access provided to\nMSPs in order to pivot into their clients’ networks. Once\nBlue Dev 5 gains access to victim organisations, it aims to\ngain long-term, stealthy, persistent access to Azure AD and\nMicrosoft 365 instances, including privileged accounts and\n\n\nsensitive data. Blue Dev 5 has demonstrated high levels\nof operational security, and has taken measures to evade\ndetections and make it harder for victim organisations\nto investigate suspicious activity (for example, logging\ninto compromised accounts at victim organisations from\nresidential IP addresses).\n\nWe are not currently able to definitively link Blue Dev 5 with\nthe threat actor behind the SolarWinds supply chain attacks\nthat we track as Blue Nova[211, 212]. However, we noted a\nsignificant overlap in techniques between the two, including\nin the techniques used to perform sophisticated identitybased attacks against Microsoft cloud environments. We\nalso noted that both Blue Dev 5 and Blue Nova[213] leverage\nthird-party trust relationships to gain access to organisations’\nIT environments.\n\nOrganisations concerned about the threat of Blue Dev 5\nshould take steps to:\n\n- \u0007Implement a robust privileged access strategy that\n\nincludes using secure administration practices and\nstringent restrictions around the use of privileged access;\n\n- \u0007Monitor Azure AD and Microsoft 365 logs for techniques\n\nused to compromise and abuse privileged accounts,\npersistence techniques, and for rare global events; and,\n\n- \u0007Regularly audit cloud (Azure AD, Microsoft 365 and Azure)\n\nconfigurations and trust relationships.\n\nBlue Dev 5 has also been observed using other well known\ntechniques to gain access to organisations’ environments,\nincluding password spraying and using compromised\ncredentials.\n\n\n-----\n\n|Col1|Col2|\n|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\nThere is evidence that the first-stage HTML attachments\nwere opened by individuals working at multiple embassies\nacross Europe,[214 ]providing insight into the broader targeting\nconducted by this threat actor. Some payloads used by Blue\nDev 5 appear to have been more targeted: one seen in March\n2021[215 ]checked for environment variables which relate to the\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs of an Eastern European country;\nanother impersonated an update for a Ukrainian government\ndocument management system.[216]\n\n\nBy tracking Blue Dev 5’s infrastructure over time, we also\nobserved its TTPs grow more complex. For example, in\na HTML lure which was likely created in November 2021,\nthe threat actor had added several more stages between\nthe initial HTML lure and the Cobalt Strike Beacon payload\nultimately delivered to targets. In this case, as well as one\nother we identified, the lure document purported to notify the\nvictim that an embassy was closed due to COVID-19.\n\nWe assess that it is highly likely that Blue Dev 5 will\ncontinue to remain active throughout the coming year,\nand that its TTPs will continue to evolve over time to better\nevade detection.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Spotlight on the Balkans: White Tur\n\nIn January 2021, PwC observed a phishing domain\ntargeting the Serbian military. [217] Soon after, we identified\nadditional related infrastructure that showed targeting of\nSerbian and Republika Srpska government and defence\norganisations ongoing since at least 2017, which we are\ntracking in association with a threat actor we call White Tur.\nRepublika Srpska is one of the two federal entities within\nBosnia-Herzegovina. This activity has taken place against a\ncomplex strategic backdrop as the wider Balkans region has\na diverse, yet fractious, history. The targeting of both Serbia\nand Republika Srpska is of particular interest as, in recent\nmonths, there have been increasingly strong calls by some\nstakeholders for Republika Srpska to gain further autonomy,\nor indeed outright secession.[218]\n\nThe additional infrastructure revealed previous activity that\nthe Ministry of Interior for Republika Srpska disclosed in\nApril 2020[219]: a spear phishing campaign impersonating the\nprime minister of Republika Srpska, which led to a malicious\nHTA file executing PowerShell code from a C2 domain which\nwe identified as connected to the Serbian military phishing\ndomain.\n\n\nContinued tracking of related infrastructure over the year\nidentified targeting of Serbian research and development\norganisations closely aligned to military and defence.[220]\nIn September 2021, White Tur performed strategic web\ncompromise on a website to host weaponised documents\nand archives with Republika Srpska and defence themes[221];\nprevious to this, weaponised White Tur files had been hosted\non dedicated threat actor-registered infrastructure.\n\nIn terms of capabilities, we observed White Tur using macroweaponised documents leading to a JScript backdoor.\nAlternatively, White Tur deployed a Windows backdoor,\npackaged in a weaponised archive containing the open\nsource project OpenHardwareMonitor, that used COM\nbitstransfer objects to send information back to the C2.\n\nOverall, we assess that White Tur is likely an espionagemotivated threat actor, and that it is likely to be aligned to a\nnation state. Based on regional tensions, there are a number\nof potential candidates for involvement in this activity, both\nwithin the Balkans and farther afield. At present, we do not\nhave sufficient technical evidence to make a high confidence\nassessment as to the potential backers of White Tur. We do,\nhowever, assess that it is likely that the Balkans will remain a\nregion of interest for threat actors of a variety of origins and\nmotivations, White Tur among them. We explore White Tur\n[further in our blog.](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/cybersecurity/cyber-threat-intelligence/threat-actor-of-in-tur-est.html)\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Head in the clouds: Blue Odin\n\nBlue Odin (aka CloudAtlas) is a threat actor known for\nits targeting of a variety of organisations across Russia\nand Russia-annexed regions of Ukraine using malicious\ndocuments, and for closely controlling the payloads\nthese documents deliver in order to increase the difficulty\nresearchers face in tracking it.\n\nIn 2021, we observed several new facets to Blue Odin’s\nactivity ranging from operational security (OPSEC) errors to\nnew TTPs. In one instance, a malicious document used to\ntarget the Ministry of Defence of a country in Central Europe\ncontained embedded links to an online translation service,\nwhich appear to have been used to translate the source of\nthe lure contents from its original English to Ukrainian. This, in\nturn, suggests that the operator who prepared the document\nmay speak Ukrainian as a first language.\n\nAnother observation was Blue Odin’s use of Responder\nin early 2021. Responder is an open source tool used to\nconduct SMB Forced Authentication attacks. In this type of\nattack, the victim system attempts to authenticate to a threat\nactor-controlled server using NTLM, enabling the threat actor\nto capture challenge hashes. These may later be bruteforced offline in order to recover the victim’s password. The\nmalicious document in question likely targeted individuals\nassociated with foreign affairs and diplomatic entities, and\ncontained UNC paths to images on threat actor-controlled\n\n\nservers which resulted in the forced authentication attack\ndescribed above. Curiously, one of the IP addresses\nembedded in the document was likely a typo; the specified\nIP did not appear to be hosting a Responder server, but\nrather an IP address with a single character difference. This\nrepresents a departure from previous techniques used in the\nthreat actor’s malicious documents, which generally used\nremote template links. In other respects Blue Odin’s activity\nremained very similar to that which has been observed\npreviously: such as a malicious document observed in\nDecember 2021[222 ]that fetched a remote template containing\nan Equation Editor exploit, which downloads and executes\nan HTA, and in turn deploys a variant of VBShower. This\nchain is very similar to the exploit chain first documented by\nKaspersky in 2019.[223]\n\nFrom the activity we observed, we assess that there is a\nrealistic probability that Blue Odin’s targeting aligns with\nUkrainian, rather than Russian, strategic priorities. For\nexample, Blue Odin activity within Ukraine’s borders seems\nto focus primarily on the self-proclaimed separatist regions in\nEastern Ukraine, and on Crimea. We also observed Blue Odin\ntargeting Russian organisations, including the energy and\ngovernment sectors.[224]\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Blue Otso’s rollercoaster\n\nBlue Otso (aka Gamaredon, Armageddon) has experienced\nboth substantial successes and major setbacks in 2021, from\nwide-ranging compromises of sensitive systems, to exposure\nby the Security Service of Ukraine.\n\nIn February, the Ukrainian National Coordination Center for\nCybersecurity reported that Blue Otso had compromised\nUkrainian government document management systems\nknown as SEI EB[225 ]and ASKOD[226]. While the initial indicators\nof compromise were sparse, we identified a set of files\nwhich were likely uploaded to an online multi-antivirus\nscanner by an individual or individuals involved with incident\nresponse related to a single ASKOD server.[227 ]These files\nincluded a variety of Blue Otso malware tools including\ndownloader scripts, exfiltration tools, a VNC client, and a\nscript used to add remote template references to Microsoft\nWord documents, which aligns with assessments made by\nthe NCCC. These archives also included file modification\ntimestamps, which we assessed are likely to be accurate\nto the times of deployment or modification on the victim\nmachine. These timestamps suggest that the threat actor\nlikely had access to the victim since at least 5th February\n2021, several weeks before the incident was disclosed.\n\nBlue Otso operations also faced notable disruptions in 2021.\nThe first example of interest was made public by the Security\nService of Ukraine in April, when they disclosed the arrest\n\n\nof someone in relation to an individual sending messages to\nthe personal numbers of SBU employees.[228 ]These messages\ncontained a link to a website that we later identified as\nmurders-dkr[.]ru, which contained a link to an archive file\npurportedly containing lists of SBU officers who had bounties\nplaced on them by one of the separatist entities. This was\na first indicator available in open source that Blue Otso,\npreviously thought to be a Russia-based threat actor, may\nwell be supported by activities from non-occupied regions\nwithin the borders of Ukraine.\n\nThis was later expanded upon in November 2021, when\nthe SBU disclosed the identities of a number of Blue\nOtso operators, and alleged that the threat actor’s activity\nis tied to an FSB unit based in Crimea.[229, 230 ]This unit is\nreportedly subordinate to the FSB’s 18th Centre, otherwise\nknown as the Centre for Information Security, a unit which\nhas previously been linked to data breaches by the US\nJustice Department. Reportedly[231 ]the SBU first suggested\nCentre 18 involvement in 2015, at which time they also\nsuggested the involvement of FSB Centre 16, better known\nfor its association with Blue Python (aka Turla, Snake). Our\nanalysis[232] noted that this announcement came amid reports\nof a Russian military buildup close to the shared Ukrainian/\nRussian border following large-scale military drills, prior to the\nwar breaking out in Ukraine.\n\nMore recent analysis suggests that Blue Otso is undeterred\nby this disclosure; we assess that it is highly likely this threat\nactor will remain active in 2022 and onwards.\n\n\n-----\n\n### New Threat\n\n\n### Actors Spotlight\n\n##### In this section, we spotlight specific cyber threat actors that we discovered in 2021. This does not mean that the threat actors were not previously active. However, as we continuously expand our tracking and identify new threat actors based on our visibility and collection, we think it valuable to give coverage in this report to lesser- known threat actors, and ones that we are still in the process of fully understanding. The threat actors we describe below have been included because they displayed interesting activity whether in their capabilities, targeting, links to other threat actors, or in the kind of operations they perform.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Red Dev 17\n\nIn 2021, we started tracking a series of intrusions under the\nmoniker of Red Dev 17 that we assess were highly likely\nconducted by a China-based threat actor. Our analysis\nsuggests Red Dev 17 has been active since at least 2017.\n\nRed Dev 17’s observed targets are mainly in India, and\ninclude the Indian military, a multinational India-based\ntechnology company, and a state energy company. We\nassess that it is highly probable that the threat actor behind\nintrusions associated with Red Dev 17 is also responsible\nfor the campaign known in open source as Operation\nNightScout.\n\nRed Dev 17 is a user of the 8.t document weaponisation\nframework (also known as RoyalRoad), and abuses benign\nutilities such as Logitech or Windows Defender binaries to\nsideload and execute Chinoxy or PoisonIvy variants on victim\nsystems.\n\nWe identified capability and infrastructure links between\nRed Dev 17 and the threat actor we call Red Hariasa (aka\nFunnyDream APT), as well as infrastructure overlaps with\nRed Wendigo (aka Icefog, RedFoxtrot), and with ShadowPad\nC2 servers. At this time, we do not have sufficient evidence\nto directly link Red Dev 17 to any of these threat actors.\nHowever, we assess with realistic probability that Red Dev\n17 operates within a cluster of threat actors that share tools\nand infrastructure, as well as a strong targeting focus on\nSoutheast Asia and Central Asia.\n\n\n###### Blue Dev 6\n\nIn October 2021, we observed several weaponised\ndocuments which used Cloudflare workers as a C2 channel.\nWe assess that this activity was likely conducted by Blue\nDev 6 (aka ReconHellCat), a threat actor first reported on\nby QuoIntelligence in August 2020.[233] The weaponised\ndocuments used remote templates and macros to execute\na payload downloaded from a Cloudflare worker C2.\nThe payload, which was heavily obfuscated, had several\nsimilarities to BlackSoul malware (also known as BlackWater),\nincluding code used to iterate through browser folders and\nauthenticate during C2 communication. The campaigns\nwe analysed targeted a range of sectors including energy,\ndefence, and government, as well as an international\nhumanitarian organisation.\n\n###### Yellow Dev 23\n\nWe tracked a new cluster of activity focusing on both the\ntelecommunication and IT sectors as Yellow Dev 23 (aka\nMalKamak, DEV-0270). Open sources reported on this threat\nactor in late 2021 and described a campaign that focused\nheavily on Israel, specifically its IT and telecommunication\nsectors.[234, 235 ]In addition to the open source reporting, we\nobserved the threat actor typosquatting domains between\nFebruary and July that spoofed Facebook and Office365\nlogins. Several of the malware samples attributed in open\nsource to this threat actor overlap with another Iran-based\nthreat actor we track as Yellow Liderc, which is known for\ntargeting the IT sector in the Middle East.[236]\n\n\n-----\n\n**Incident response case study:**\n### White Dev 89 calling\n\n\nIn 2021, we supported an incident response investigation\nat a health organisation involving a threat actor we named\nWhite Dev 89. This threat actor was observed performing\nopportunistic targeting, likely using malvertising campaigns,\nto deliver trojanised applications such as Zoom, AnyDesk,\nand Windscribe to its victims. These would install the\nrespective legitimate applications, but at the same time drop\nand execute a malicious PowerShell script (likely a modified\nversion of a PowerShellEmpire agent). This access allowed\nthe threat actor to perform basic reconnaissance on the\ninfected system. [237]\n\n\nOnce White Dev 89 profiled a compromised machine, we\nobserved it dropping an additional PowerShell script to\ndeploy Cobalt Strike Beacon. This kicked off further activity\n\n- including laterally moving via SMB to other systems on the\nnetwork. Other lateral movement techniques that White Dev\n89 used included compromising high-privilege accounts,\nrunning tools such as ADFind and BloodHound to map out\nthe targeted network, and using 7-ZIP and SubInAcl during\npost-exploitation.\n\n\n**While the ultimate objectives of this threat actor are not clear, we found connections to other known campaigns. In**\n**particular, we found overlaps with infrastructure previously used in QakBot campaigns, leading us to hypothesise that**\n\n\n-----\n\n#### PwC Incident Response statistics\n\n**Figure 27: IR ransomware cases by sector 2021** **Figure 28: Incidents per type 2021**\n\n\n19\n\n\nManufacturing\n\nFinancial Services\n\nLogistics and Transport\n\nHealthcare and Pharmaceuticals\n\nRetail\n\n\n13\n\n\n11\n\n\n10\n\n\n8\n\n\n6\n\n\nHospitality and Leisure\n\n\n5\n\n\nReal Estate\n\n\n5\n\n\nGovernment and Public Sector\n\n\n5\n\n\nMedia\n\nEducation\n\n\n4\n\n\n4\n\n\nTelecommunications and Technology\n\n\nAPT, 6, 5.2%\n\nCrime, 92, 77.3%\n\nInsider, 11, 9.2%\n\nHacktivist, 1, 0.8%\n\nUnknown, 9, 7.5%\n\nSource: PwC\n\n\n4\n\n\nMultIsector Conglomerates\n\n3\n\nConsumer Markets\n\n2\n\nAgriculture\n\n2\n\nAutomotive\n\n2\n\nCharities and NGOs\n\n2\n\nInsurance\n\n1\n\nMaritime\n\n1\n\nOil & Gas\n\n1\n\nEngineering and Construction\n\nSource: PwC\n\n\n-----\n\n#### PwC Threat Intelligence reporting statistics\n\n\n**Figure 29: Reports per location of threat actor 2021**\n\n##### 264\nTotal\n\n##### 74\n\nIran-based\n\n##### 67\n\nChina-based\n\n##### 43\n\nWhite (unknown)\n\n##### 27\n\nRussia-based\n\n##### 21\n\nNorth Korea-based\n\n##### 17\n\nIndia-based\n\n##### 15\n\nOther\n\nSource: PwC\n\n\n**Figure 30: Reports per sector 2021**\n\nGovernment\n\n\nOil & Gas\n\nAerospace\n\nRetail\n\n\n114\n\n\n54\n\n\nDefence\n\nTechnology\n\nFinancial Services\n\nTelecommunications\n\n\n41\n\n\n34\n\n\n34\n\n\n32\n\n\nManufacturing\n\nPolitical\n\nEnergy\n\nNGO\n\nEducation\n\nHealthcare\n\nMedia\n\n\n31\n\n\n30\n\n\n30\n\n\n29\n\n\n26\n\n\n25\n\n\n22\n\n\n20\n\n\n19\n\n\n17\n\n\nTransport\n\n\n16\n\n\nAviation\n\n\n15\n\n\nProfessional Services\n\n\n15\n\n\nUtilities\n\n\n14\n\n\nDissident\n\n\n13\n\n\nConstruction\n\n\n13\n\n\nLogistic\n\n\n11\n\n\nLegal\n\n\n10\n\n\nConsumer Markets\n\n\n10\n\n\nHospitality & Leisure\n\n\n10\n\n\nSecurity\n\n\n9\n\n\nAutomotive\n\n\n8\n\n\nInsurance\n\n\n8\n\n\nMaritime\n\n\n-----\n\n### Sectors\n\n\n### spotlight\n\n##### In this section, we highlight key cyber threats we observed in 2021 across a selection of sectors.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Telecommunications\n\n2021 saw continued interest in the telecommunications\nsector by espionage-motivated threat actors, likely for the\npurposes of sensitive information collection as we have\nobserved in previous years.[238 ]We estimate that more than\n80 telecommunications companies have been compromised\nby threat actors based in two countries.\n\nAs referenced earlier in this report, Red Menshen (formerly\nRed Dev 18) deployed its bespoke BPFDoor malware to\nmultiple organisations in the Asia Pacific region, including\ntelecommunication providers based in several countries.[239]\n\nPwC has observed other China-based threat actors targeting\nthe telecommunications sector, including Red Kelpie (aka\nAPT41) using its Motnug loader malware on a Pakistanbased provider.[240 ]This same victim also appears to have\nbeen targeted by Iran-based threat actor Yellow Mora[241]: in\nthe beginning of 2021, PwC analysed a campaign by Yellow\nMora (aka Greenbug) targeting the telecommunication sector\nin South Asia.[242 ]Our analysis showed that Yellow Mora likely\nspent a prolonged period of time in the victim’s environment,\nwhich aligns with public reporting on the way this threat\nactor operates.[243 ]Similar activity by Yellow Nix (aka Static\nKitten, MERCURY, MuddyWater), starting in January and\ncontinuing throughout the year, targeted a large number of\ntelecommunication organisations in the Middle East, South\nAsia, Southeast Asia, and Central Asia.[244 ]PwC assesses this\ntargeting is likely intended, at least in part, to surveil and track\nindividuals, which aligns with historical targeting of this sector\nby closely aligned groups like Yellow Mimas.[245]\n\nNor did this sector escape targeting by ransomware\noperations. Blue Lelantos’s new Macaw ransomware,\nfor example, was deployed against a US-based\ntelecommunications company, while White Janus and White\nApep – two of 2021’s most active ransomware operators –\nalso targeted multiple entities in this sector with Lockbit 2.0\nand Darkside/BlackMatter ransomware, respectively. Overall,\nseveral state telecommunications companies, as well as\nhigh-profile private telecommunications providers, have fallen\nvictim to ransomware in the past year, including Ecuador’s\nCorporacion Nacional de Telecomunicacione, Schepisi\nCommunications, and Spain’s MasMovil.\n\n\n#### Technology\n\nInnovative technology is valuable to those looking to replicate\nproducts and services, and intellectual property continues\nto be sought after by threat actors. Technology companies\nthemselves may be targeted in supply chain and island\nhopping attacks, particularly where they provide services\n(including IT and cybersecurity) to customers. In 2021,\nseveral airline companies (including members of the One Star\nAlliance and other individual airlines in the Asia Pacific region)\nwere compromised through an initial breach of their shared\ncommunication technology suppliers: SITA.[246 ]Open source\nanalysis[247 ]of this set of intrusions pointed to Red Kelpie as\nthe likely perpetrator. We also observed Red Djinn attempting\nsimilar types of intrusions, with the threat actor targeting\noverseas subsidiaries of Japanese companies likely to move\nlaterally and into the target’s main network.\n\nThreat actors were observed using technology company\nnames in SSL certificates associated with their malicious\ninfrastructure, as was identified with China-based threat\nactors where ShadowPad C2 infrastructure was identified\nmasquerading as NVIDIA Corporation[248]. We also observed\nsamples of HyperBro malware signed with a certificate\nbelonging to a mobile app company. While there is evidence\nto suggest HyperBro malware might be shared among\nmultiple China-based threat actors, its original user is Red\nPhoenix (aka APT27, Emissary Panda, Lucky Mouse). We\nobserved Red Phoenix specifically continue targeting the\ntechnology sector, and identified its compromise of at least\none US-based technology company.\n\nTargeting against the technology sector was also initiated\nby cyber criminals, with Acer being compromised by REvil\nransomware on two separate occasions: the second of which\nsaw the company receiving a ransom demand of US$50m,\none of the highest publicly known to date.[249]\n\nFinally, Israeli technology companies also found themselves\nreceiving unwanted attention (purportedly a ‘hacktivist’\ncampaign) from White Dev 95, which we assess is very likely\na sabotage-motivated threat actor conducting an information\noperation (IO) against Israel. Rather than using it for\nextortion, the threat actor encrypts its victims’ networks and\nimmediately proceeds to leak any stolen data—activity that\nbears the hallmarks of “lock and leak” operations.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Financial services\n\nOrganisations in the financial services (FS) sector remained\na high-value target for cyber criminal threat actors. Across\nover three months of listings on criminal marketplaces\nRaidForums, XSS, and Exploit, the financial services entities\nconsistently ranked in the top three most-affected sectors.\nThey had a higher price relative to other impacted sectors, no\ndoubt due to FS listings being of greater interest to buyers in\nterms of potential financial gains.\n\nEstablished organised crime groups may specifically\ntarget FS entities due to the expectation of large ransom\npayments. For example, in early 2021 US insurance company\nCNA was initially compromised when employees executed\na fake browser update. The organisation reportedly ended\nup paying a ransom of US$40m. In May 2021, operators of\nthe Avaddon ransomware leaked data belonging to Asiabased divisions of the AXA Group (including customer PII),\nand containing sensitive medical data; they also threatened\nto attack AXA websites with a Distributed Denial-of-Service\n(DDoS) attack if a ransom wasn’t paid. More recently, in late\nNovember 2021 we observed a MirrorBlast campaign most\nlikely conducted by White Austaras, involving spam emails\nthat suggests the targeting of insurance companies based\nin Canada and France, as well as of a number of Asset\nand Wealth Management firms based in the US and\nHong Kong.[250]\n\nNorth Korea-based threat actors continued to pose a severe\nthreat to FS organisations across the board, from investment\nand venture capital firms, to cryptocurrency exchanges\n(or any other organisation handling cryptocurrency). A\nFebruary 2021 US Justice Department indictment of North\nKorean nationals (believed to be part of Black Artemis)\nstates that the threat actor stole US$11.8m from a New\nYork financial institution using trojanized cryptocurrency\ntrading applications.[251 ]Black Alicanto and Black Dev 2 have\nbeen consistently targeting FS entities, often sending spear\nphishing emails to targets as well as using lure documents\nrelated to cryptocurrency, or pretending to be legitimate joint\nventure pitches.\n\n\n#### Retail\n\nIn 2021 ransomware operators continued to target the retail\nsector, exploiting retailers’ need to maintain uninterrupted\noperational uptime—thereby effectively pressuring their\nvictims to pay ransom, quickly. The rapid digitalisation\nof the retail sector has led to ransomware actors’ ability\nto cripple endpoint payment systems, leading to revenue\ngeneration loss; further pressuring the organisation\nto meet the ransom demand.\n\nOf the ransomware variants that have been observed\ntargeting the retail sector Conti, operated by threat actor\nWhite Onibi, was the most active. This ransomware was\nused to successfully target retailers from clothing outlets to\njewellery stores for either big ransom payouts or the theft\nof unique, sensitive information,[252, 253, 254 ]that White Onibi\nauctioned in 2021.[255]\n\nOther ransomware operators also targeted the retail sector.\nAs part of the supply-chain attack against Kaseya, Sodinokibi\nransomware infected the network of Visma Esscom, an IT\nsupplier. As a result of the Visma Esscom infection, over\n500 individual Coop stores across Sweden had to close\nafter its payment systems were taken offline.[256] In another\nexample, in December 2021 a ransomware incident affecting\nretailer SPAR forced a reported 330 UK stores offline for – in\nsome cases – several days. These incidents are just a few\nof the numerous ones afflicting the retail sector in 2021 and\nthreatening normal business operations.[257, 258, 259, 260]\n\nOur analysis of listings on criminal marketplaces showed\nthat, while the majority of listings for retail companies\ncontained customer data, several (particularly on the\nExploit forum) promised buyers the ability to redirect card\npayments on e-commerce websites. For brands that operate\nin the e-commerce space it’s also worth remembering that\ncredit card skimming operations known as “Magecart” are\nongoing[261], with the UK NCSC notifying over 4,000 small-tomedium retailers just ahead of the Black Friday sales period\nthat they were using compromised payment portals on their\nMagento e-commerce platforms.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Incident response case study:**\n### DarkSide - from initial access to ransom demand in four hours\n\n\nIn April 2021, PwC Incident Response teams from multiple\ncountries supported a global retail client that had fallen victim\nto a ransomware attack perpetrated by DarkSide (tracked by\nPwC as White Apep).\n\nAnalysis of the incident determined that the threat actor\ninitially leveraged a remote access tool known as LogMeIn\nto gain access to the client’s IT estate. This tool was used\nfor legitimate purposes by one of the organisation’s IT\nservice providers to enable remote access for maintenance\nof retail store workstations and supporting systems.\nThe initial intrusion used a functionality in the LogMeIn\nsoftware whereby users with valid credentials can remotely\naccess a system without any client employee needing to\ninteract with it.\n\nAfter compromising the retail store client in Country A,\nthe threat actor downloaded administration tools, using\nthem to perform internal reconnaissance on the client’s\nnetwork. Simultaneously, it elevated its privileges to a default\nadministrative account used throughout the domain through\nLSASS memory dumping. Using the elevated privileges, the\nthreat actor pivoted to systems in Country B which were\nend-of-life and not receiving updates.\n\n\nThe threat actor then used the credentials collected from\nthese systems to create a Domain Administrator user,\ngenerating and storing the account password in a LastPass\naccount belonging to the threat actor.\n\nOnce the threat actor had compromised the Domain\nController, it created a scheduled task and deployed it to\nall computers in the client’s IT infrastructure, commanding\nthem to download and run the ransomware. The time\nfrom the initial compromise to the ransomware being\ndeployed was roughly four hours. While the ransomware\noperator demanded a US$12m ransom, the client managed\nto establish manual business processes to keep the\norganisation operational throughout incident response and\nrecovery efforts that spanned three weeks.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### DarkSide\n\n###### From initial access to ransom demand in four hours\n\n\n-----\n\n**Incident response case study:**\n### ShinyHunters hunting for treasure\n\n\nIn December 2021, PwC responded to an incident at an\nIndia-based retail client that had initially observed a spike in\nsystem resource utilisation across its cloud infrastructure,\nand subsequently received a ransom email from the cyber\ncriminal threat actor we track as White Dev 100 (aka\nShinyHunters).\n\nAnalysis revealed that the threat actor initially gained access\nto the network by using a compromised cloud access key\nbelonging to a former C-Suite member of the organisation.\nThe threat actor used the compromised credentials to gain\nweb console access to the client’s infrastructure. It was\nunable to access any of the instances, and proceeded to run\nreconnaissance commands to map the network.\n\n\nThe threat actor was able to create new instances and SSH\nkeys, eventually injecting them into the SSH-authorised keys\nstore. These actions, combined with the modifications to the\nsecurity group, allowed the threat actor to freely SSH into\nthe client environment. In addition, it accessed a number\nof .ssh directories and copied available private SSH keys\nto support its lateral movement. As the threat actor moved\nthrough the network it identified systems of interest, including\ntesting and automation instances which it exploited for\nfurther access. During this time the threat actor maintained\naccess to multiple terminal windows into the compromised\nenvironment. From analysis of the activity it has not been\npossible to determine if multiple operators were at work,\nor a single individual.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Manufacturing\n\nFor organisations in the manufacturing sector, any attack\nwhich can impact the availability or integrity of infected\nsystems poses a critical risk to an organisation. These\nattacks cause operational downtime, production and delivery\nslowdowns resulting in lost revenue, as well as heavy\nremediation costs which add to the difficulties of returning\nto service. There are also knock-on issues such as delays\nin production deadlines, breach in supplier contracts, and\nreputational damage. Increasingly, the sector is experiencing\nsignificant and targeted attacks, ranging from disgruntled\nemployees selling sensitive data to competitors to\nransomware attacks conducted by sophisticated organised\ncrime groups.\n\nOperators of BlackMatter ransomware campaigns targeted\nmanufacturing organisations more than any other sector\nbetween January and May 2021, in a series of sophisticated\nattacks which netted over GBP 17.5 million in bitcoin\npayments[262]. Lockbit 2.0 also exhibited a heavy focus on\nthe manufacturing organisations, with 21% of leak site data\nbetween January and September 2021 belonging to victims\nin the sector.\n\nBEC attacks remain a substantial threat to all sectors,\nincluding manufacturing. In 2021, PwC observed a campaign\nmost likely associated with Nigeria-based Bronze Dev 2 (aka\nSilverTerrier) targeting organisations in the manufacturing\nsector by sending spear phishing emails with a malicious\nattachment posing as an urgent budget document, which\nwould deliver the commodity RAT AgentTesla.\n\nEspionage remains prevalent within the manufacturing sector,\nand it has historically attracted high levels of interest from\nintelligence-gathering threat actors due to its associations\nwith defence and aerospace customers. More widely, the\ntechnology investment taking place across the sector is likely\nto result in a renewed surge of interest. In April 2021 Black\nArtemis delivered weaponised lure documents, masquerading\nas job applications, to manufacturing companies which\ndeployed malicious payloads onto the victim network[263]. The\nimpact of a successful espionage attack can result in the loss\nof competitiveness in already tight international markets, as\nwell as regulatory penalties if personal data is accessed\nin an intrusion.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Incident response case study:**\n### Multinational manufacturing corporation facing LockBit\n\n\nIn March 2021, PwC responded to a ransomware incident\naffecting a multinational corporation operating in the industrial\nmanufacturing sector, where a LockBit operator executed the\nransomware on servers and workstations across ten different\ncountries.\n\nThe incident analysis and investigation highlighted that\nstarting from Q4 2020 the threat actor began gathering\ninformation about the client and preparing the attack.\nAfter gaining initial access, the threat actor used the file\nhosting service MEGA to download malware and conducted\nweb searches to understand the location and nature\nof the infected systems. Subsequently, the threat actor\ndownloaded and executed network scanner tools (Softperfect\nNetwork Scanner) and performed lateral movement using\ncompromised accounts and supported by popular tools\n(including Mimikatz).\n\n\nThroughout the following months, the threat actor\ncompromised a domain controller in the United States, then\nmoved to yet another server in the US, and in March 2021\nleveraged a domain controller in Japan to distribute the\nransomware.\n\nIn the final moments of the attack, the threat actor interacted\nwith the client’s antimalware solution to ensure that the\nransomware would not be stopped, and ultimately distributed\nand executed the ransomware. Although the attack caused\nsignificant disruption to the victim organisation, there was no\nclear evidence of data exfiltration.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Conclusion\n\n##### In 2021, the cyber threat landscape continued\n to see an increase in threat actors of all motivation\n and skill levels.\n\n\nAs in recent years, ransomware continues to be the most\npervasive and immediately impactful threat to organisations\nof all sizes and sectors across the world, with ransomware\ndevelopers continuing to grow their affiliate schemes in\nsize, revenue, and capabilities. Supply chain attacks have\nnow become part of the “new normal” of the cyber threat\nlandscape, with cyber criminal threat actors incorporating\nthem in their playbooks for maximum impact.\n\nAt the same time, a different type of threat to a secure\ndigital society has been brought squarely into focus with the\nprominence and impact of digital quartermasters: both those\ntraditionally aligned with state-sponsored operations, as well\nas commercial private sector brokers providing a wide range\nof clients with high-end offensive tooling and capabilities.\n\n\nAll these threats have culminated in a renewed focus on\n0-day vulnerabilities - with several examples enabling both\ntargeted operations and mass-scale attacks, and growing\nfinancial and strategic incentives pushing exploit research\nand development activity.\n\nWe assess that the themes that have emerged or have\ncontinued into 2021 – including ransomware and its\nsurrounding criminal ecosystem, the importance of\nvulnerability and tools brokers, and the fallout of newly\ndiscovered vulnerabilities impacting unprepared victims\n– will continue into 2022. In the face of headline-grabbing\nvulnerabilities and incidents, cybersecurity becomes ever\nmore present in the public eye, and it is even more important\nthan ever for defenders to continue collaborating, sharing,\nand supporting organisations and society; focusing on\nprevention and detection measures, as well as incident\nmitigation and response plans that can stymy threat\nactors effectively.\n\n\n-----\n\n### PwC Cybersecurity\n\n##### If you would like more information on any of the threats detailed in this report, please feel free to get in touch with us at threatintelligence@pwc.com.\n\n\nPwC is globally recognised by industry analysts as a leader\nin cybersecurity; as a firm with strong global delivery\ncapabilities, and the ability to address the security and risk\nchallenges our clients face.\n\nWe underpin our board-level security strategy and advisory\nconsulting services with expertise gleaned from the front\nlines of cyber defence across our niche technical expertise\nin services such as managed cyber defence, red teaming,\nincident response, and threat intelligence.\n\nWe differentiate ourselves with our ability to combine\nstrategic thinking, strong technical capabilities, and complex\nengagement delivery with client service excellence.
