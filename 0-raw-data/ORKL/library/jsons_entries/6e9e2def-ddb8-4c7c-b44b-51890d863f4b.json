The [FortiGuard Labs team has identified yet another spear](https://www.fortinet.com/fortiguard/labs?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=fortiguard-labs)\nphishing campaign, this one targeting aviation companies. In this campaign, a malicious link\nthat distributes an AsyncRAT payload is sent to aviation companies with a well-crafted\nmessage. AsyncRAT, an open-source remote administration tool, is used to steal credentials\nand other sensitive data. It also includes the capability to upload and download files on the\ncompromised machine. This blog highlights the various stages of this spear phishing\ncampaign and its newly adapted techniques.\n\n## Spear Phishing Campaign Overview\n\n[The infection cycle begins with phishing emails sent to aviation companies that contain](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/phishing?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=phishing)\nmalicious links disguised as pdf attachments. The link in the email directs the user to VB\nScript hosting sites, from which the initial payload (.vbs) is delivered. The .vbs script then\ndrops the second stage payload, an xml file containing inline C# .NET assembly code that\nacts as a RAT loader. The loader hollows and injects the final payload, AsyncRAT, into the\nvictim process (RegSvcs.exe). AsyncRAT, also known as RevengeRAT, connects to its C2\nserver, takes control of the compromised machine, and introduces additional payload. I will\nnow dive into each of these steps in a bit more detail.\n\nFigure 1: Infection cycle of the spear phishing campaign\n\n## Spear Phishing Email\n\n[Spear phishing is a highly targeted attack resulting from extensive research on targeted](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/spear-phishing?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=spear-phishing)\nusers and their organizations conducted by threat actors. The phishing emails observed in\nthis campaign were sent to multiple aviation companies. They all appear to be coming from\nthe federal aviation authority using a spoofed sender address that matches with a “foreign\noperators affairs” email address for enquiries/approvals. The email goes through the extra\nstep of having a signature and a logo to impersonate a federal authority. Also, the content is\ncarefully crafted to create a sense of urgency by making it to look like a Reporting of Safety\nIncident (ROSI) from Air Traffic Control. In addition, the email contains malicious Google\nDrive links disguised as a pdf attachment. Most of the emails in this campaign contain the\nstrings ROSI, AOP, Incident Report, as well as the attachment name “ROSI-AOP Incident\nReport Details, <date>”.pdf.\n\n[(See Mitre ATT&CK technique – Spearphishing Link.)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/002/)\n\nFigure 2: Spear Phishing Email sent to an aviation company\n\nAs of the time of writing this blog, these emails had not been flagged as phishing or\nsuspicious by any of the VirusTotal engines.\n\nFigure 3: VT detections for the emails\n\n\n-----\n\nThe IP address 192.145.239.18 is used to send all the emails in this campaign. This IP\n[address is also associated with Snip3 Crypter, an aviation-themed campaign seen in April](https://blog.morphisec.com/revealing-the-snip3-crypter-a-highly-evasive-rat-loader)\nand May of 2021. A three-month review of its telemetry reveals a spike in the last few weeks,\nwith the majority of visitors coming from the UAE, Canada, Argentina, Djibouti, and Fiji.\n\nFigure 4: Statistics for IP v4 address 192.145.239.18\n\n## Visual Basic Script (VBS) /Wscript\n\nWhen you click on the link (the fake pdf attachment), the user’s default browser is launched\nand directed to a VB Script hosting site. This site delivers the initial payload (.vbs), which,\nonce executed, drops subsequent payloads and establishes persistence.\n\nThe VB script “ROSI-AOP Incident Report Details,May 31st.vbs“ contains the next stage\npayload, “Good.xml”. This payload is encoded using Server.URLEncode() and obfuscated to\nevade detection. Antonin Foller's VBS decode function from PSTRUH Software\n[(http://www.motobit.com) is used to decrypt the payload. After decryption, \"Good.xml\" is](http://www.motobit.com/)\nwritten to the victim's Temp directory, where it is launched using MSBuild.exe. If you’re not\naware of this executable, it is present on all Windows machines with the .NET framework\ninstalled. It’s a trusted developer utility used to speed up the process of creating .NET\napplications. Because it is a trusted utility, adversaries use the tool in an effort to evade\ndetection. (See Mitre ATT&CK technique – Trusted Developer Utilities Proxy Execution:\nMSBuild.)\n\nIn the script below, the payload bytes are first substituted for de-obfuscation, then decoded\nbefore being written to the Temp directory.\n\nFigure 5: Initial Payload VB script with encoded payload bytes\n\n## XML\n\nOnce the VB script executes successfully, the Good.xml file, which contains inline C#\nassembly code, a loader dll, and the RAT payload, is dropped into the victim's Temp\ndirectory. All the files are saved as an ASCII byte array, and the RAT payload is also\nreversed to avoid signature-based detection. In this case, the adversary employs the method\ndiscovered by Casey Smith to compile and execute the inline C# code using the native\nWindows binary (MSBuild.exe).\n\nFigure 6: Good.xml with inline C# code\n\nWhen Good.xml is executed, it first creates a file named \"Startups32.vbs\" in the system\nstartup folder. The .vbs script contains code to run Good.xml file after each system startup to\nmaintain persistence. (See Mitre ATT&CK technique – [Persistence.)](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0003/)\n\nFigure 7: Startups32.vbs\n\n\n-----\n\n## .NET RAT Loader\n\nAfter achieving persistence, Good.xml retrieves the .NET Rat loader from the byte array and\nloads it into the current application. The .NET RAT loader is contained in the byte array\nsBytes in the XML, which is loaded using the method Thread.GetDomain.Load(sBytes). The\nmethod Thread.GetDomain() returns the domain of the current running thread, while Load()\ndynamically loads the byte array assembly into the current application domain during\nruntime.\n\nThe projFUD.dll, available in VirusTotal, is the RAT loader DLL in use. We observed that a\nfew bytes of the file have been tweaked to avoid hash-based detection. The description and\ncopyright mentions “VLC MEDIA PLAYER”. However, the file is not signed.\n\nFigure 8: Loader dll tweaked to evade from detection\n\nAlthough the namespace and class name “ProjFUD.PA” in the loader is same as the one\nreported in the snip3 campaign, the PDB string retrieved from the loader DLL is different. It is\nlikely to have come from a different author.\n\nFigure 9: PDB string retrieved from snip3 loader dll\n\nFigure 10: PDB string retrieved from this campaign’s loader dll\n\nAfter loading the .NET loader assembly, the function Execute() of the class ProjFUD.PA is\ncalled with the arguments payloadBytes (RAT payload) and RegSvcs.exe (the path of the\nvictim process).\n\nThe .NET assembly ProjFUD.dll acts as a RunPE loader as it hollows and injects the final\npayload, AsyncRAT, into the victim process. RegSvcs, a Windows command line utility for\nregistering .NET Component Object Model (COM) assemblies, is used by an adversary to\nhide malicious payload. RegSvcs.exe is digitally signed by Microsoft and can be used to help\nbypass a process-based whitelist. (See Mitre ATT&CK technique – Process\n[Injection: Process Hollowing.)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/012/)\n\nCreateProcessA is first called to create the victim process RegSvcs.exe in a suspended\nstate, with flags set to 134217732U (0x08000004) (i.e., CREATE_SUSPENDED and\nCREATE_NO_WINDOW are set to True.) This process does not run until the thread is\nresumed. While the process is suspended, ZwUnmapViewOfSection is called to unmap\n(hollow) the code from the process memory. This routine unmaps the entire view of the\nsection containing buffer1 from the virtual address space, and on successful return, the\nvirtual-address region occupied by the view is no longer reserved and available to map other\nviews.\n\n\n-----\n\nNext, it allocates space for the payload using VirtualAllocEx, with size set to the payload\nlength and page protection to PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE (0x40). It then injects the\npayload into the allocated space using WriteProcessMemory. The thread context is changed\nto point to the payload by calling SetThreadContext and the thread is finally resumed via\nResumeThread to execute the payload AsyncRAT.\n\nFigure 11: Malware using RegSvcs\n\nAfter successfully injecting and executing the AsyncRAT payload, the loader exits.\n\n## AsyncRAT\n\nAsyncRAT then takes command and control of the infected machine via a C2 server. As\nmentioned in the introduction, the AsyncRAT is an open-source Remote Access Tool (RAT)\ndesigned to remotely monitor and control other computers through a secure encrypted\nconnection. It performs a variety of malicious tasks, and if you want to learn more about it,\nthe GitHub [AsyncRAT-C-Sharp link can help.](https://github.com/NYAN-x-CAT/AsyncRAT-C-Sharp)\n\nAsyncRAT uses the following anti-analysis techniques to protect itself from being analyzed.\nBecause Virtual Machines (VM) and sandboxes are used for the majority of dynamic analysis\nwithin the security community, many payloads, including this one, will try to evade dynamic\nanalysis. In this case, the RAT retrieves the manufacturer via the WMI query “Select * from\nWin32 ComputerSystem” and looks for the strings \"VMware\" and \"VirtualBox”. It also checks\nfor disk space because sandboxes and virtual machines typically have limited disk space. In\naddition, it loads the module SbieDll to detect “sandboxie”, an open-source sandboxing\nprogram for Windows. Lastly, it checks if the process is being debugged by calling\n[IsDebuggerPresent(). (See Mitre ATT&CK technique – Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion.)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1497/)\n\nThe payload also includes a security software discovery technique. This technique is used to\ndetermine which security products are present on the compromised machine to shape the\nfollow-on behaviors. Below is the command-line query used to enumerate the installed\n[antivirus products. (See Mitre ATT&CK technique – Defense Evasion.)](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0005/)\n```\nwmic.exe /Namespace:\\\\root\\SecurityCenter2 Path AntiVirusProduct Get displayName”\n\n```\nOnce the information is gathered, it then sends the following information about the infected\nmachine to the C2 RAT server. (See Mitre ATT&CK technique – Exfiltration Over C2\nChannel.)\n\nThis RAT hosts resources and additional payloads on Pastebin, an online content hosting\nservice. In the below code snippet, the RAT client grabs an IP address from the pastebin\nwebsite using WebClient.DownloadString() and connects to it. (See Mitre ATT&CK technique\n[–Acquire Infrastructure: Web Services.)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583/006/)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe AsyncRAT client requests that the RAT server send additional plugins and payloads,\nwhich are then executed in memory, as shown below. It employs a fileless technique to\nexecute payloads in memory, reducing its footprint and avoiding traditional defenses that\nscan the disk for malicious files.\n\nTo maintain its foothold, it installs a scheduled task if the payload is running as an\nadministrator. The reason it checks for admin rights is that a task created with elevated\nprivileges does not prompt the user to allow execution. If the payload isn’t running as an\nadministrator, it will add an entry to the Registry Run keys, causing the program to run every\ntime the user logs in. (See Mitre ATT&CK technique – [Persistence.)](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0003/)\n\nKeylogging is the most prevalent type of input capture, and it’s used to steal credentials. This\nis done by intercepting the user’s keystrokes using Hooking API callbacks. This technique\nworks by hooking into the Windows native API functions intended for processing keystroke\ndata, and the callback function is invoked every time the user types something. (See Mitre\nATT&CK technique – [Input Capture: Keylogging.)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056/001/)\n\n## C2 Server\n\nAfter successfully compromising the victim’s machine, the AsyncRAT payload connects to\nthe RAT C2 server located at “franco.ddns.net” on port 2455 (79.134.225.18:2455). Since\n2019, IP 79.134.225.18 has been linked to AsyncRAT / RevengeRAT, NanoCore, and BotNet\nattacks. It is associated with the ISP provider “ The PRIVACYFIRST Project”, which runs\nmultiple VPN services and supports the TOR project.\n\nThe C2 domain “franco.ddns.net” used in this campaign is just few weeks old, hence the\nassociated spike.\n\nFigure 12: Statistics for C2 domain franco.ddns.net\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe campaign analyzed in this blog is likely part of Snip3 Crypter-as-a-service, as some of\nthe artifacts (i.e., Sender IP, C2 IP address, and the final payload) are the same. But this one\ndoesn’t use PowerShell script. Instead, it employs a new technique to compile and execute\ninline C# code contained in an XML. This is yet another example of threat actors quickly\nadopting and evolving techniques to create more sophisticated and difficult-to-detect attacks.\nIn addition to the Fortinet protections below, I would encourage you to review the Mitre attack\ntechniques and measure how effective your current security controls are.
