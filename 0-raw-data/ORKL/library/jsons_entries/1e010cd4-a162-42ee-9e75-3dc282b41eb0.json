Data leaks and\ncyberattacks by unfriendly states are part\nof today’s everyday reality.\n\n\nOver the past decade, the number\nand complexity level of cyberattacks\ncarried out by both state-sponsored\nhacking groups and financially\nmotivated cybercriminals have increased\nsignificantly. People, businesses, and\ngovernment institutions can no longer\n\n\nbe confident in neither the security\nof cyberspace nor the integrity and\nsecurity of their data.\n\nThe Internet has become our\ncivilization’s circulatory system. Yet\nthe freedom of communication and\n\n\n###### The freedom of communication and the global opportunities that the Internet provides are at risk\n\n\nFor more than 16 years, Group-IB experts\nhave been investigating cyber incidents\nby analyzing the tools and infrastructure\nused by attackers. Each new cyberattack\ntargeting a company, political party,\nor critical infrastructure facility gives\nus the opportunity to see how attack\ntactics and tools evolve.\n\nAs a company, we strongly believe\nthat public organizations and private\ncompanies that fight against cybercrime\n\n\nmust exchange data and publish\ntheir research. That is why 6 years\nago we released the first High-Tech\nCrime Trends report. Every year,\nGroup‑IB's annual report highlights the\nchanges that have occurred over the past\nyear. It is the most comprehensive source\nof strategic and tactical data on current\nglobal cyberthreats. This year’s study\ncovers the period H2 2018 — H1 2019\nas compared to H2 2017 — H1 2018.\n\n\n[By using unique tools](https://www.group-ib.com/ti/graph.html) for monitoring\n[the infrastructure of cybercriminals and](https://www.group-ib.com/ti/graph.html)\nstudying the findings published by other\nsecurity teams worldwide, we find and\nconfirm common patterns that form\nan integral picture of the evolving\ncyberthreat landscape. On this basis,\nwe formulate forecasts that come true\nevery year.\n\n\n###### Group-IB’s report: a single comprehensive source of strategic data on cyberthreats and reliable forecasts of their development\n\n\nThe leading and most frightening trend\nof 2019 was the use of cyberweapons\nin military operations. Conflicts between\nstates have taken on new forms, and\ncyber activity plays a leading role\n\n\nin this destructive dialogue. Attacks\non critical infrastructure and targeted\ndestabilization of the Internet in certain\ncountries are breaking new ground\non cyberattacks. A peaceful existence\n\n\nis no longer possible while being\nout of touch with cybersecurity. The\nlatter cannot be ignored by any state,\ncorporation, or individual.\n\n\n###### Targeted destabilization of the Internet heralds a new  era of cyberattacks\n\n\n###### Group-IB supports the initiatives of The Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace (GCSC), created to provide recommendations for promoting cyber stability in the world.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### TOP 10 TRENDS\n\n|Military operations conducted using cyberweapons 3 military operations were conducted in the first half of 2019 when cyberweapons were involved|In the first half of 2019, three open military operations became known: in March, a successful attack on a Venezuelan hydroelectric plant caused a massive blackout that left much of the country in the dark for several days; in May, in response to a cyberattack, Israel's military retaliated with an airstrike against a building known to be the cyber HQ for Hamas; and in June, a cyberattack was conducted on Iranian computer systems that controlled its rocket and missile launchers in response to Iran's downing of a US drone. The attack tools involved in all the above cases have not been identified, and in the latter case, a cyberattack occurred just a few days after the drone incident. This confirms the assumption that critical infrastructures of many countries have been compromised and that attackers go unnoticed until it is too late.|\n|---|---|\n\n|Internet destabilization at the state level All levels of communications infrastructure can be compromised|Nowadays, the most social and economic damage can be caused by depriving people and businesses of Internet access. That being said, countries that build centralized access control to the Internet are becoming more vulnerable and may become the first targets. In recent years, treat actors have tested attacks on various levels of the communications infrastructure. By the end of 2019, researchers had detected successful attacks on Internet routing systems and BGP hijacks, attacks on DNS root server administrators, national domain administrators and domain name registrars as well as DNS hijacks, and attacks on local systems of filtering and blocking traffic.|\n|---|---|\n\n|5G expansion-related challenges The development of 5G networks will create new threats|Shifting to 5G networks will further deteriorate the situation in the telecommunications sector. One of the reasons is that 5G architecture paves the way for new types of attacks on operators. Another reason is that competition for a new market may lead to hacking capabilities being demonstrated against certain vendors and result in countless anonymous investigations into the vulnerabilities of some technological solutions.|\n|---|---|\n\n|Hidden threats linked to state-sponsored groups 38 state-sponsored groups were active throughout the period investigated; 7 of them are new|Although many investigations into new state-sponsored groups were published in the previous period, this sphere remains poorly understood. The activity of 38 groups was discovered; seven of them are new cyberespionage groups. This does not mean that other well-known groups ceased their activity, however. It is more likely that their campaigns remained under the radar. In the energy sector, for example, only two frameworks capable of affecting processes were detected: Industroyer and Triton (Trisis). Both were found as a result of an error on the part of their operators. It is highly likely that there is a significant number of similar, undetected threats, which essentially is a ticking time bomb. It is also worth noting that publicly known state-sponsored groups mainly originate from developing countries. There is still no public information about such attacks orchestrated by developed countries.|\n|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\n|Hacking back: state- sponsored groups go against each other Iran, China, and Russia were attacked and some of the data stolen were made public by groups posing as hacktivists|In 2019, cases where threat actors disguised as hacktivists or former group members released information about attack tools used by other groups became more frequent. They were most often examples of hacking back, when attackers become the victims. Today, private companies cannot legally conduct such operations. Hacking back is authorized only in the case of national security services.|\n|---|---|\n\n|Russian-speaking groups conducting targeted attacks shift their focus to foreign banks Сobalt and Silence began attacking mainly banks outside Russia|Currently, only five groups pose a real threat to the financial sector: Cobalt, Silence, MoneyTaker (Russia), Lazarus (North Korea), and SilentCards (a new group from Kenya). In Russia, damage from targeted attacks on banks carried out by financially motivated threat groups has dwindled almost 14-fold. One of the reasons is that Russian-speaking threat actors have been shifting to banks worldwide.|\n|---|---|\n\n|Trojans for PC and Android are gradually disappearing 22 trojans for PCs and Android fell out of use and only 7 new tools appeared to replace them|The trend of Trojans for PCs disappearing from the cyberthreat landscape continues. in Russia, the \"homeland\" of this type of threat, hackers have stopped developing them. Brazil is becoming the main source of new PC Trojans. However, they are used locally only. Only Trickbot has evolved significantly over the past year and can now be used in targeted attacks on banks and for espionage against government agencies, as was the case with the Trojan Zeus. Android Trojans are disappearing slower than PC malware, but in any case the number of new ones is significantly lower than those that have disappeared. Banking fraud malware has evolved from text message interception to automatic transfer of funds through mobile banking applications; this new feature is called ATS, i.e. Automated Transfer System. The number of active Trojans will continue to decline due to the introduction of security measures and a sharp reduction in economic efficiency for attackers.|\n|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Evolution of social Amid slumping Trojans, the threat of social engineering without the use of malware engineering without the is growing. Attackers continue to use fake social media accounts, phone fraud use of malware with well-prepared scripts, passport databases for reliability, etc. Relatively new\n\nmethods of social engineering include controlling phones using remote access\nprograms that victims install on their devices after being tricked into doing\n###### Remote access tools so by scammers.\n\nas a relatively new social\nengineering vector\n\n###### Growth of the carding With a drop in ROI from the use of banking Trojans for PCs and Android, attackers market thanks to began to use a more effective method to make money: JS sniffers. There are JS sniffers already more JS sniffers than banking Trojans for PC and Android. The total\n\nnumber of cards compromised by JS sniffers has increased by 38%.

The consulting, and group’s main goals are cyber espionage and financial theft.

The threat actors’\ncommand center was destroyed\nas a result. The strike was launched\nby Israel, and the laws of other countries\ndo not prohibit military action in response\nto cyberattacks. This sets an extremely\ndangerous precedent.\n\nWorld leaders claim that cyberweapons\ncan be used to disrupt adversaries’\ndefense infrastructure. Deploying such\nweapons essentially equates to a military\noperation on another country’s territory.\n\nThe blackout in Venezuela that left most\nof the country without electricity for days\nwas partially caused by a cyberattack.\nIt is believed that the attack was carried\nout by the opposition to destabilize the\ncountry.\n\n\nState-sponsored attackers are increasingly\ninterested in telecommunications\ninfrastructures. Their targets are operators,\ndomain name registrars, and organizations\nresponsible for top-level domains and root\nname servers.\n\nSome state-sponsored threat groups\ngo against each other. Disguised\nas hacktivists, they make public the\ntools used by their rivals and information\nabout them. On the one hand, this helps\ncriminal investigators find perpetrators.\nOn the other hand, it helps attackers\nbetter imitate the activity of other\ngroups.\n\nAttacks were carried out successfully\non computer manufacturers, with the\naim of delivering malicious code to the\nequipment they produce. This shows\nthat many manufacturers are not ready\nto fight targeted attacks, and supply\nchain attacks on their customers will\nremain a relevant attack vector.\n\n\n**FORECAST: USE OF CYBERWEAPONS TO DISRUPT INTERNET STABILITY IN SOME COUNTRIES**\n\n\nsuch countries are at higher risk of falling\nvictim to attacks that disrupt the Web\nand cause more damage. As a result,\nthese countries may become a place\nwhere threat actors conduct such attacks\nand showcase their ability to disrupt the\nInternet.\n\n\nScenarios in which a country could\nbe disconnected from the Internet\nseemed unrealistic, yet they are\nbecoming increasingly likely. Disrupting\nthe Web requires long-term preparation,\nbut it is technically feasible. The\nincreasing warmongering rhetoric and\naggression could lead to demonstrations\nof such capabilities. Governments\nand businesses must ensure that their\nservices are robust enough to withstand\nsuch situations.\n\n\nDomain name registrars are part\nof critical infrastructures. Disrupting\ntheir work affects the World Wide Web,\nwhich is why registrars are targeted\nby government-sponsored threat actors.\nNext year, there will be a high risk of more\nthreat actors carrying out successful\nattacks, including for sabotage purposes.\n\nCertain countries are trying to build\na system of centralized control over\nInternet access. This runs contrary to the\nprinciple of Internet robustness and\n\n\n-----\n\nAPT28 — Russia APT28 — Russia DarkHotel — North Korea OilRig — Iran Equation Group – USA\n\nGorgon Group —\nTurla — Russia APT37 — North Korea APT37 — North Korea PowerPool\nPakistan\n\nGorgon Group —\nCharming Kitten — Iran PowerPool Kimsuky — North Korea Windshift\nPakistan\n\nGorgon Group —\nDarkHotel — North Korea Sidewinder — India Gaza Cybergang – Gaza MuddyWater – Iran\nPakistan\n\nAPT29 – Russia APT29 — Russia Chafer — Iran Bahamut – Middle East APT37 — North Korea\n\nAPT33 – Iran MuddyWater – Iran APT-C-35 MuddyWater – Iran Winnti – China\n\nAPT-C-36 – South\nAPT10 – China BlueMushroom APT33 – Iran Lazarus – North Korea\nAmerica\n\nKimsuky — North Korea APT33 – Iran APT10 – China Gallmaker Whitefly\n\nGamaredon Group – Gamaredon Group –\nXenotime — Russia APT29 – Russia APT-C-27 – Middle East\nRussia Russia\n\nLazarus – North Korea Gallmaker OceanLotus – Vietnam Lazarus – North Korea Buhtrap – Russia\n\nTEMP.Periscope — China Inception OilRig – Iran FruityArmor – UAE APT28 – Russia\n\nSTOLEN PENCIL –\nTurla – Russia Whitefly Emissary Panda – China HEXANE\nNorth Korea\n\nLEAD – China Winnti - China APT-C-38\n\nOceanLotus – Vietnam BITTER – India Domestic Kitten – Iran\n\nLazarus – North Korea Turla - Russia Chafer – Iran\n\nTEMP.Periscope — China Xenotime – Russia StrongPity – Turkey\n\nLazarus – North Korea HEXANE\n\nAPT40 - China\n\nUnidentified group,\nTajMahal framework\n\n*** new groups**\n\n\n-----\n\n###### KEY TRENDS AND FORECASTS BY INDUSTRY\n\n Threats to the telecommunications sector\n\n\n**CURRENT THREATS**\n\n\nA major threat to the\ntelecommunications sector is BGP\nhijacking, which disrupts the accessibility\nof networks and many services they\npower. After such attacks, restoring\naccessibility usually takes several hours.\n\nThe expansion of 5G networks opens\nup new opportunities for threat actors,\nas does any type of next-generation\ntechnology. 5G architecture paves the\nway for new types of attacks on operators.\n\n\nVulnerable routers, which are rented out\nto legal entities and individuals, present\nan enormous threat to the telecom\nsector. Insecure settings coupled with\nno updates result in deteriorated services\nand more malicious traffic. This gives\nthreat actors the opportunity to carry\nout various attacks based on operators’\ninfrastructures.\n\n\n**FORECAST: THE DEVELOPMENT OF 5G NETWORKS WILL CREATE NEW THREATS**\n\n\nMany telecom operators are Managed\nService Providers and provide security\nservices to government and commercial\norganizations. Threat actors will attack\noperators to penetrate the networks they\nprotect.\n\n\nThe cybersecurity level of 5G market\nplayers will be a factor that determines\ntheir share of the market.\nCybersecurity problems faced\nby a 5G platform provider give other\nproviders a competitive advantage.\nDemonstrations of ways to exploit and\ndisrupt the work of 5G operators will\nbe used as a tool of unfair competition.\nSuccessful attacks could cause providers\nirreparable reputational damage.\n\n\nWider 5G integration will significantly\nincrease the capabilities of ordinary\ncybercriminals to carry out DDoS attacks,\nmanipulate traffic, and spread malware.\n\nIn a few years, telecom companies\nwill struggle to detect hardware and\nfirmware backdoors in 5G infrastructure\nequipment.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Threats to the energy sector\n\n\n**CURRENT THREATS**\n\n\nCompromising IT networks using\ntraditional techniques and malware—\nincluding living off the land attacks—\nis the main vector for penetrating isolated\nsegments of OT networks.\n\nOnly two frameworks capable\nof affecting processes, Industroyer and\nTriton (Trisis), were detected in recent\nyears. Cybersecurity experts link them\nto Russia.\n\n\nBoth frameworks were detected\ndue to a mistake on the part of their\noperators. It is clear that many threats\nremain undetected, which is a ticking\ntime bomb.\n\nIn 2019, Lazarus attacked an energy\ncompany in India. The target is not\nan obvious choice for a state-sponsored\nthreat group, which could point to the\nmilitary’s growing interest in this type\nof attack.\n\n\n**FORECAST: IT NETWORKS AND SUPPLY CHAIN ATTACKS WILL BE THE MAIN PENETRATION VECTOR**\n\n\nThe most significant threat is expected\nto come from developed countries.\nThreat actors in such regions are better\nequipped, which is why their activity\nis less noticeable and less thoroughly\ninvestigated.\n\n\nIT networks will remain the main attack\nvector for threat actors. Access to these\nsegments is crucial for espionage and\ncollecting information about how\nto attack a particular energy company for\nsabotage purposes.\n\nOT network compromise will be the next\nstep once the network’s IT segment\nis successfully breached. Detecting\nOT compromise is only possible in two\ncases: if the attack is designed for\n\n\nsabotage purposes or if the malware\noperator makes a mistake. Attackers\noften try to be as covert as possible until\nthey must carry out a mass attack.\n\nSupply chain attacks will pose a serious\nproblem for the energy sector from the\npart of various software and hardware\nproviders. Management companies will\nbe attacked first, then used to penetrate\nnetworks belonging to energy\ncompanies.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Threats to the financial sector\n\n Targeted attacks on the financial sector\n\n\n**CURRENT THREATS**\n\n\nSilentCards is a new group that carries\nout targeted attacks on banks in Africa.\nDespite their poor technical skills\n(compared to other groups), they\nsuccessfully steal money in this region.\n\nFastCash, a new theft method, was\ndetected in 2018, though it was first used\nin Asia in as early as 2016. The Lazarus\ngroup is behind all attacks of this kind.\n\nExperts observed the following trends\nin attack schemes: Silence was the only\nthreat actor that carried out attacks\nthrough ATMs; Silence and SilentCards\nused card processing, while Lazarus used\nSWIFT (two successful thefts in India and\nMalta amounting to $16 million in total).\n\n\nSilence stopped using mail-outs, instead\nbuying them from other hacking groups\n(especially TA505).\n\nEach Russian-speaking group carried\nout an attack in Russia over the period\ninvestigated. Cobalt attempted to steal\nfrom a company twice, but the theft\ndid not cause any significant financial\ndamage. Compared to the previous\nperiod, the average stolen sum in Russia\ndropped from $1.8 million to $480,000,\nwith the total stolen sum amounting\nto $1.5 million, i.e. 93% less than in the\nprevious period.\n\n\n**FORECAST: LARGER GEOGRAPHICAL SCOPE OF RUSSIAN-SPEAKING GROUPS**\n\n\nother industries. Their main vector will\nbe blackmail in ransomware attacks.\n\nThe Trickbot Trojan has markedly\nimproved (see section Banking Trojans\nfor PC) and can now be used in targeted\nattacks on banks and for espionage\nagainst government agencies, as was the\ncase with the Trojan Zeus.\n\n\nRussian-speaking groups (Silence,\nMoneyTaker, and Cobalt) are\nlikely to continue their expansion\nby multiplying their attacks outside\nRussia. To withdraw money, they will carry\nout attacks on card processing systems\nand use Trojans for ATMs. The groups will\nshift their focus away from SWIFT.\n\nLazarus will remain the only group to steal\nmoney through SWIFT and ATM Switch.\nThe threat actor has previously carried\n\n\nout successful attacks through ATM\nSwitch against banks that use software\nrunning on IBM AIX. Such banks will\ntherefore be the first to catch the threat\ngroup’s attention.\n\nInfrastructure disruption to cover tracks\nwill be the final stage of successful\nattacks.\n\nSilentCards may remain local and focus\non African banks. The group is likely\nto expand its list of targets by attacking\n\n\n-----\n\n|CORKOW Trading Terminals Card Processing,|, ATM|\n|---|---|\n\n\n###### 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Non-targeted attacks and threats to banking customers\n\n Growth in carding activities due to the spread of JS sniffers\n\n\nDumps continue to have the largest\nshare of the carding market, with a 46%\nincrease in the number of dumps for sale.\nThe sale of textual data (card number,\nCVV, expiration date) is also on the rise,\nwith a 19% growth.\n\nThe largest bank card data leaks are\nrelated to compromises of US retailers.\nThe US is far ahead and comes first, with\n93% of all cards compromised.\n\nMiddle Eastern countries (Kuwait,\nPakistan, the UAE, and Qatar) together\naccount for 2.38% in this classification.\nIt is believed that the increase in the\nnumber of compromised cards was\ncaused by Lazarus attacks in late 2018\nand early 2019.\n\n\nJS sniffers became a point of growth\nas regards the volume of textual data.\nAs at spring 2019, Group-IB detected\n38 different JS sniffer families. At the time\nof publishing this report, that number has\neven grown. There are more JS sniffers\nthan banking Trojans.\n\nIn terms of JS sniffer–related attacks, the\nUS is first again, with UK banks coming\nsecond. This is mainly due to the attack\non British Airways in late 2018, which\nresulted in more than 300,000 bank\ncards being compromised.\n\n\n**FORECAST: DECLINE IN PHISHING AND EXPLOSIVE GROWTH IN SOCIAL ENGINEERING**\n\n\nSMS traffic in certain countries\nis becoming a common tool for sharing\nlinks to phishing websites. As a result,\nleaks of phone number databases and\naccess to personal mobile operator\naccounts, which can be used to send SMS\nmessages, are becoming more popular.\n\n\nPhishing kit developers began devoting\nmore attention to self-defense. They\nblacklist cybersecurity vendors’ subnets\nand hosting providers, show phishing\ncontent only from the IP addresses of the\nregion where their victims are located,\nredirect users to legitimate websites, and\ncheck anomalous user agents.\n\n\nIn an effort to attract customers, phishing\nkit developers started equipping their kits\nwith user-friendly management systems.\nNow, instead of working with logs via\nemail, customers can conveniently\nmanage data via simple web panels.\n\nFinancial phishers began using panels\nfor managing web injects and the autofill\nfunction. Such panels have previously\nbeen used in banking Trojans.\n\n\nMoreover, new types of social\nengineering techniques are emerging.\nFor instance, as part of an increasingly\npopular scheme, users are asked to\ninstall a remote control tool on their\nmobile device, thereby giving the\nhackers access to all applications and\ndata thereon.\n\n\n**New sophisticated social**\n**engineering methods**\n\nConsiderably reduced activity of\nbanking Trojans for PC and Android,\ncombined with fewer phishing attacks,\nhas made theft methods using social\nengineering the most widespread\nthreat.\n\n\nSocial engineering comes in many\nforms. Schemes in which victims\nare prompted to reveal their logins,\npasswords, and bank card details and\ntransfer money via ATMs and mobile\napplications are widely known. Threat\nactors use various channels to contact\ntheir victims, such as phone calls,\nmessaging apps, and social media.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Fewer banking Trojans for PC\n\n**Trickbot is the only Trojan to have**\n**significantly evolved over the last year:**\n\n- \u0007new module for collecting passwords\nfrom installed applications;\n\n- \u0007ability to steal RDP, VNC, and\nPuTTY data as well as configuration\nfiles from SYSVOL directories\non domain controllers;\n\n\nRussian-speaking hackers no longer\ncreate banking Trojans for PC. Brazil\nhas become a new source of this type\nof malware. So far, it is used to attack the\nlocal population only.\n\nOwners of old botnets are not expanding\ntheir geographical scope and tend\nto attack banking customers in two\nor three countries where it is easier for\nthem to launder stolen money.\n\nThere are two groups that still steal\nmoney in Russia using Trojans for PC:\nRTM and Buhtrap2. Only the former\nshows continued activity (and uses the\nTrojan RTM).\n\n- fileless attacks and use of Mimikatz;\n\n- \u0007no module and configuration file\ndownload to disk (Windows 10);\n\n- \u0007mail-outs from compromised\ncomputers;\n\n- new cookie stealer.\n\n\nSome experts have singled out the group\nGrim Spider. It uses Trickbot for network\nreconnaissance purposes to then load\nthe Ryuk ransomware and demand sums\nexceeding $100,000 for decrypting the\nvictim’s device.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Autofill and fake push notifications in banking Trojans for Android\n\n\nIn the past, money was stolen from bank\naccounts mainly by displaying fake\nwindows where bank card, login, and\npassword details were to be entered.\nTransaction confirmation codes were\nobtained by intercepting SMS messages.\nThe year 2019 saw the appearance\nof Trojans that automatically transfer\nmoney via mobile banking apps, i.e. the\nautofill feature.\n\nPush notifications were thought\nto be a reliable method of delivering onetime codes. Now, however, Trojans use\nthe Accessibility Service to manipulate\npush notifications, copy their text, and\nactivate certain areas.\n\nThe US managed to make the authors\nof Android Trojans prohibit the use\nof their malware in the States, not just\nin Russia and other post-Soviet countries.\n\n\nThe year 2019 saw the appearance of the\nmost advanced Android Trojans, which\nwere developed in order to be rented out.\nTheir price ranges from $800 to $2,000\nper month.\n\nOwners of banking botnets began\ndevoting more attention to self-defense\nand sanbox bypassing methods.\n\n\n**FORECAST: GRADUAL REPLACEMENT OF TROJANS BY JS SNIFFERS AND CHANGES TO METHODS OF SOCIAL**\n**ENGINEERING AND PHISHING DISTRIBUTION**\n\n\nJS sniffers will be the most rapidly\nevolving threat; they make attackers\nmore money than banking Trojans. There\nare already more JS sniffers than banking\nTrojans for PC and Android. That said, the\nthreat will mainly affect countries where\nthe 3D Secure system is not widely used.\n\nPOS Trojans will not undergo significant\nchanges. They will continue to be used\nmainly in attacks on retailers in the\nUS and, to a lesser extent, in Spanishspeaking countries.\n\n\nPhishing and social engineering will\nremain the biggest threat to online\nbanking customers. There may be a shift\nfrom email to text message as the main\ndistribution channel for phishing links.\n\nThe owners of DDoS botnets built\non numerous infected routers may start\nrenting them out to hackers who engage\nin phishing. Phishing is usually more\nprofitable than DDoS attacks.\n\nSchemes involving remote support\nthrough remote access tools will shift\nfrom PCs to mobile devices. They will\nhave one of two goals: to obtain bank\ncard information from the customer\nor to request payment for fake services\n(e.g. security checks, removing threats\nfrom devices).\n\n\nThe number of active banking Trojans for\nPCs will decrease except in Brazil, where\nthreats are developing locally. Moreover,\ntheir geographical scope will shrink due\nto the integration of security tools and\nmarkedly reduced financial benefits for\nattackers.\n\nCurrently, the autofill feature\nin Android Trojans is implemented for\neach malicious program individually.\nIf a tool for developing a universal\nautofill feature appears on the market\n(as was the case with Zeus), it may speed\nup the development of Android Trojans.\nHowever, this is unlikely to happen within\na year.\n\n\n-----\n\n### NEW PHASE IN CYBERWAR:\n\n###### Internet destabilization attacks\n\n\n**May 5, 2019, Palestine. According**\nto Israeli sources, on May 4, 2019,\nhackers from the militant group Hamas\ntried to carry out a cyberattack. Israel\ndeclined to reveal the incident details.\nTo counter the attack, the Israel Defense\nForces launched an airstrike on a building\nin the Gaza Strip, where the hackers\nheadquarters is believed to have been\nlocated.\n\n**June 2019, Iran. On June**\n20, 2019, Iran's Islamic Revolutionary\nGuard Corps (IRGC) shot down\na US drone. The US retaliated a few\ndays later by launching a cyberattack\non IRGC's missile control systems. Such\nan attack requires months of preparation,\nwhich suggests that the systems had\nbeen compromised prior to that.\n\nDisruption of Internet infrastructures,\nwhich nearly all government and private\norganizations depend on, is becoming\na dangerous attack vector. The sections\nbelow look at scenarios that have\nalready been tested and could be used\non a larger scale at government level\nin the next year.\n\n\nIncident in Iran has once again\nconfirmed the suggestion\nthat the critical infrastructure\nof many countries has already been\ncompromised, but attackers remain\nunnoticed until they act.\n\n\nIn 2019, cybersecurity became a heavily\ndebated topic in politics. The activities\nof cyber armies and the rhetoric\nof political leaders around cyberattacks\ncontinue to gain momentum.\n\n**March 2019, Venezuela. Sabotage**\nat the Simón Bolívar Hydroelectric Plant,\nalso known as the Guri Dam, resulted\nin a mass-scale blackout in Caracas\nand 22 of all 23 states in the country.\nAccording to TASS, a news agency, the\ncountry’s Communications Minister said\nthere had been “a cyberattack against\nthe automated control system”. The\nplant was shut down in response to the\nattack. Unlike other well-known attacks\non energy companies, this is the first time\nthat a large part of a country was left\nwithout electricity for several days.\n\nAll these cases show that cyberspace\nis becoming a battlefield. This trend could\nlead to new cyberattacks on military and\ngovernment systems in order to disrupt\ntheir work, cause social and economic\ndamage, and destabilize countries.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### DNS HIJACKING AND ATTACKS ON DOMAIN NAME REGISTRARS\n\n\nThe DNS protocol underpins the World\nWide Web and hackers who gain control\nover it can be extremely dangerous.\nMoreover, carrying out operations using\nthis protocol does not require having\naccess to DNS servers.\n\nThere are two possible scenarios when\npurchasing a domain name:\n\n- \u0007either the domain registrar\nprovides DNS server services;\n\n- \u0007or the registrar provides a domain\nname only, with DNS servers being\nrun by a different provider.\n\nIn either scenario, each customer can\nspecify the following information in their\npersonal account on the domain name\nregistrar’s website:\n\n- \u0007what DNS servers will be responsible\nfor a particular domain name;\n\n- \u0007what IP addresses the traffic will\nbe sent to when there is a request\nto access the resources related\nto this domain name.\n\nThis means that by compromising\na particular domain name registrar,\nthreat actors can manipulate all domains\nregistered through that registrar. The\nsituation is made worse by the fact\nthat countries usually have only a few\nmajor registrars, which service both\ngovernment and private organizations.\n\nSimultaneously hacking several\nmain registrars will paralyze website,\nmail, and DNS servers, as well as all\nservices connected to them, for most\n\n\nof the country. If such an attack were\nto be conducted in combination with\nsabotage activities, restoring the\nregistrar’s stability and recovering their\nconfiguration would be impossible. The\nresulting situation would damage all\nindustries without exception.\n\nIn addition to individual registrars,\nattackers could target organizations\nthat manage country code top-level\ndomains. Almost every country has this\ntype of organization. For instance, the\nSingapore Network Information Centre\n(SGNIC) Pte Ltd is responsible for\nSingapore’s domain zone .sg.\n\nDomain name registrars and\norganizations responsible for root\ndomain services have become a new\npriority for threat actors. Information\nsecurity experts detected several such\nincidents in 2019.\n\n\nThe attacks described above\nwere successful and targeted\nindividual organizations in both\nthe government and private\nsectors. If threat actors become\nset on disrupting national\ninfrastructures, attacks like these will\nhave much wider consequences.\n\n\n\n[1] https://www.netnod.se/news/statement-on-man-in-the-middle-attack-against-netnod\n\n[2] https://www.zdnet.com/article/hackers-breached-greeces-top-level-domain-registrar\n\n\n-----\n\n###### BGP HIJACKING AND ATTACKS ON INTERNET ROUTING SYSTEMS\n\nAnother fundamental routing protocol\nis BGP (Border Gateway Protocol). **NOVEMBER 2018** **BGP ROV**\nThe idea behind BGP hijacking\n\nMainOne, a Nigerian Internet service The new BGP Route Origin Validation\n\nis to redirect the network traffic\n\nprovider, made a configuration mistake (ROV) standard is now part of the\n\nof certain prefixes of an autonomous and changed routes in such a way that BGP protocol security package,\nsystem (IP address pools) through the traffic to Google services was directed along with BGP Resource Public Key\nthreat actor’s equipment.

BGP ROV allows\nis cyberespionage. affected. It took 74 minutes to fix the routers to use BGP RPKI information\n\nissue after it was detected. During this to filter out unauthorized route\n\nHowever, network routes can also time, some Google users experienced advertisements and prevent BGP\nbe manipulated to disrupt major access problems.[[2]] from being intercepted by attackers\ntelecommunications companies. There intending to redirect traffic from\nhave been many major, publicly shared legitimate servers to malicious ones.\nincidents (although they were a result **JUNE 6, 2019** Experts say the problem was that the\n\nBGP attribute they used caused a\n\nof either human error or misconfiguration the Swiss company Safe Host (AS21217) crash in the software of the routers\nrather than targeted attacks). caused a leak of 70,000 routes to based on FRRouting (FRR)—a set of IP\n\n\nAmazon, YouTube, VK (Russian social Another noteworthy example is a 2019\nnetwork), ivi.ru (online video streaming experiment, the aim of which was\nservice), and many others.[[1]] to analyze new BGP security features.\n\nIt culminated in the failure of routers\nof Internet service providers in Asia and\nAustralia.\n\n[1] https://radar.qrator.net/blog/no-filters-shoot-your-foot\n\n[2] https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-a-nigerian-isp-knocked-google-offline/\n\n[3] https://www.zdnet.com/article/for-two-hours-a-large-chunk-of-european-mobile-traffic-was-rerouted-through-china/\n\n\nThe cases described above show\nthat manipulating traffic does not\nrequire access to the targeted\ncompany’s network hardware. Access\nto an area border router is enough\nto be able to change the BGP\nconfiguration.\n\nSo far, BGP hijacking has had large-scale\nbut short-term effects. For prolonged\nsabotage, threat actors will need to have\nboth access to the network routers\nof several operators as well as preprepared scenarios for manipulating\ntraffic. In such cases, BGP hijacking could\ncause significant network congestion\nin some countries (similar to what\nhappens in energy company networks).\n\n\n-----\n\n###### ATTACKS ON LOCAL SYSTEMS OF FILTERING  AND BLOCKING TRAFFIC\n\n\n###### Traffic decryption\n\nUsually, transmitted content\nis encrypted, so some countries\nrequire users to install governmentissued certificates. Once installed, the\ncertificate helps local government\nagencies decrypt user traffic.\n\nSuch certificates are issued\nby designated centers. Banning\ncertificates by browser and operating\nsystem would affect all users who have\nthese certificates installed.\n\nThis happened to DarkMatter, a UAEbased cybersecurity company. Google\nannounced plans to ban root certificates\nowned by DarkMatter from Chrome\nand Android. Mozilla also announced\nthat its browser Firefox would not trust\ncertificates from DarkMatter. In August\n2019, Google and Mozilla blocked\na Kazakh government–issued root\ncertificate used for intercepting traffic.\n\n\nSome countries have implemented\nor are creating filtering systems that\nanalyze and block certain user traffic.\nSuch technological solutions facilitate\nattacks aimed at blocking the operation\nof a network in a particular country.\nThe attacks summarized below have\nbeen tested by threat actors and may\nbe conducted on a larger scale in the\nfuture.\n\n###### Blacklisted resources\n\nInternet Service Providers (ISPs) block\naccess to harmful websites (terroristrelated, malicious, linked to drug\ntrafficking, etc.) based on blacklists. The\nlists consist of domains, IP addresses, and\nlinks. They are constantly updated so that\nmalicious resource owners cannot bypass\nrestrictions.\n\nIn cases where operators cannot\ndeploy DPI (Deep Packet Inspection)\nsystems, they must restrict traffic based\non IP addresses. Knowing this, attackers\n\n\nleverage blacklisted domains to block\nlegitimate resources. Owners of banned\nwebsites list the IP address of a legitimate\nwebpage in their DNS information, which\nleads to providers blocking the legitimate\nsite. If a blacklisted domain name has\na new legitimate IP, it will automatically\nbe blocked by the provider.\n\nSince 2017, attackers in Russia have used\nthis technique to bring down Wikipedia\nas well as banking and government\nresources. In March 2019, a similar\nattack was carried out against the users\nof Yandex, a Russian search engine.\n\nThis is an easy and cheap way to conduct\ncyberattacks. Companies can protect\nthemselves by introducing a whitelist\nof critical resources that must never\nbe blocked. However, blacklists are\ndistributed in a centralized manner.\nIf an attacker gains access to the server\ndistributing these lists, they will be able\nto add any subnet to it.\n\n\n\n[1] https://www.netnod.se/news/statement-on-man-in-the-middle-attack-against-netnod\n\n[2] https://www.zdnet.com/article/hackers-breached-greeces-top-level-domain-registrar\n\n\n-----\n\n### EVOLUTION\n###### of state-sponsored threat groups\n\n GEOGRAPHICAL SCOPE OF ATTACKS AND NEW GROUPS\n\n\n**1.

Many have been conducting operations for several years and have gone unnoticed for a long time. Some groups\nattack similar targets, which leads to competition between them and means that their actions are detected quicker.\n\n###### Windshift Geographical scope Initial infection Tools\n\nThe Middle East Trusted relationship (social WindTail\n\nengineering) WindTape\nSpear phishing\nDrive-by compromise\n\nThe cyberespionage group WindShift has been flying under the radar for many years thanks to its\ndistinctive feature—thorough attack preparation.\n\nThe attackers created fake user pages on social media (LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram,\nand Google Plus) and sent friendly messages to potential victims. The interactions lasted from\nsix months to a year, during which the attackers tricked their victims into divulging valuable\ninformation.\n\nThe group mainly targets employees of government agencies and critical infrastructure facilities\nin the Middle East. Victims' macOS systems were attacked using crafted malicious programs: OSX.\nWindTail.A, OSX.WindTail.B, and OSX.WindTape.\n\n###### Blue Mushroom Geographical scope Initial infection Tools\n\nChina Spear phishing SinaAppEngine\n\n(aka Sapphire Mushroom,\n\nps_backdoor\n\n\nThe group Blue Mushroom (aka Sapphire Mushroom, APT-C-12) has been operating since 2011\nbut only became known in mid-2018.\n\nIts attacks involve cloud infrastructure. For example, the group uses Amazon S3 and cloud server\ncommunication protocols to exfiltrate confidential user information.\n\nThe attackers also use the Digital Ocean cloud service as C&C and the SinaAppEngine (SAE)\nservice to create their own C&C infrastructure.\n\n###### Geographical scope Initial infection Tools\n\nThe Middle East Spear phishing Metasploit\n\n\nGallmaker has been operating since at least December 2017 but was only discovered in 2018.\nTo compromise systems, attackers exploit the Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) feature in Word\napplications. The DDE protocol is used to exchange information between Office programs that\nuse shared data or a shared memory.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### APT-C-36\n\n(aka Blind Eagle)\n\n\n###### Geographical scope Tools\n\nColombia Spear phishing Imminent Monitor RAT\n\n\nAPT-C-36 (aka Blind Eagle) is a threat actor originating from South America that became known\nin late 2018. Its goal is to steal trade secrets from major companies and government agencies; its\nmain infection vector is malicious emails. To hide the sender’s IP address, the threat actor uses\nproxy and VPN services.\n\n###### Geographical scope Initial infection Tools\n\nSingapore Spear phishing Mimikatz\nSoutheast Asia Trojan.Vcrodat\nRussia Termite\n\nNibatad\n\n\nSecurity specialists first detected Whitefly in 2018 after an attack on Singapore’s largest public\nhealth organization, SingHealth, which resulted in a reported 1.5 million patient records being\nstolen.\n\nThe group has gone unnoticed since 2017. They mainly target companies based in Singapore.\n\n\n###### Geographical scope Initial infection\n\nThe Middle East Supply chain attack\n\nSpear phishing\nPassword spraying\n\n\n###### Tools\n\nDanBot\nPoshC2\nPowerShell Empire\n\n\nHEXANE is a new group targeting the industrial sector. Its members have been active since mid2018, focusing on the Middle East, Central Asia, and Africa.\n\n###### Geographical scope Initial infection Tools\n\nCentral Asia — TajMahal\n\n\nIn the fall of 2018, reports revealed a newly discovered sophisticated APT framework, TajMahal.\nIt has been used for at least 5 years, but it remains unclear to which group the tool belongs.\nThe framework consists of two packages named Tokyo and Yokohama and contains around\n80 malicious modules. The tool is designed to conduct cyberespionage campaigns, but the list\nof confirmed victims only contains one: a diplomatic entity from a country in Central Asia.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### SUPPLY CHAIN ATTACKS\n\nLast year’s Group-IB Hi-Tech Crime\nTrends report identified BIOS/UEFI\nattacks as one of the most prominent\ntrends. Experts predicted that the\nmain targets would likely be firmware\nand motherboard developers based\nmainly in the APAC region, where\nlarge companies have their production\nfacilities.\n\n###### Winnti attacks on hardware manufacturers and game developers\n\nA few months after Group-IB's report was\nreleased, its prediction was confirmed\nby news about a malware campaign\ncalled Operation ShadowHammer.[[1]]\nTo deliver malware, attackers leveraged\nthe legitimate utility ASUS Live\nUpdate, which automatically updates\ncomponents such as BIOS, UEFI, drivers,\nand applications.\n\nThe trojanized utility was signed with\nthe legitimate certificate “ASUSTeK\nComputer Inc.” and was hosted on the\nofficial ASUS server.\n\nSimilar malware delivery techniques\nwere used to infect software belonging\nto three other manufacturers, whose\nnames were not disclosed. The attacks,\nconducted for espionage purposes, are\nlinked to the Chinese group Winnti.\n\n[1] https://securelist.com/operation-shadowhammer/89992/\n\n\nIn addition to equipment manufacturers,\nthe same group successfully attacked\nthe gaming industry. In total, two games\nand one gaming platform were infected.\nOne of the affected gaming companies\nis located in Thailand.\n\n###### Plead (aka BlackTech) campaigns: Focus on Taiwan\n\nIn July 2018, cybersecurity experts\ndiscovered a new malware campaign\ninvolving the Plead backdoor, which\nwas digitally signed using a valid D-Link\nCorporation code-signing certificate.\nAt the end of April 2019, the experts\nidentified multiple attempts to deploy\nthe same malware in an unusual way.\nThe Plead backdoor was created and\nexecuted by a legitimate process named\nAsusWSPanel.exe. The executable file\nwas digitally signed by ASUS Cloud\nCorporation. Plead malware has always\nbeen most widely deployed in Taiwan.\n\n###### Unsuccessful attack on vendors  of software for developers\n\nIn 2019, an attack on an international\nvendor of development tools for various\nprogramming languages was discovered.\nThe attackers compromised the\n\n\ncompany's infrastructure and accessed\nthe Docker containers used to build\nthe software, after which they were\ndiscovered. Allegedly, they planned\nto inject malicious code into legitimate\nprograms at the assembly stage.\n\n###### Chinese group attacks through Hewlett Packard (HP) and IBM\n\nIn December 2018, Chinese attackers\nreportedly infiltrated the networks\nof Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE)\nand IBM as part of the Cloudhopper\ncampaign. By gaining access to the\nnetworks, they were subsequently able\nto hack into computers belonging to HPE\nand IBM clients.\n\nCloudhopper compromised client\ndata in 12 countries, including Brazil,\nGermany, India, Japan, the United Arab\nEmirates, Great Britain, and the United\nStates. The clients were from industries\nsuch as finance, electronics, medical\nequipment, biotechnology, automotive,\nmining, and oil and gas.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### HACKING BACK\n\n“Hacking back” is a controversial method\nthat helps victims of cyberattacks take\na more proactive approach to deterring\ncyberthreats. The question of whether\nprivate companies can legally conduct\nsuch operations has been discussed for\nyears. Today, hacking back is allowed only\nin the case of national security services.\nIn 2019, there were more instances when\ninformation about tools used by attackers\nwas made public as part of retaliatory\nattacks.\n\nIn March 2019, the Telegram channel\nLab Dookhtegan posted tool source\ncodes used by the Iranian group OilRig\n(APT34) and data about its members.\nThe information included the identities\nof hacked victims as well as the\nnames, surnames, and social media\nprofiles of supposedly active group\nmembers, including leaders. A user\nwith the nickname \"Lab Dookhtegan\"\nclaims to be a former member\nof OilRig and to have worked on the\ngroup's DNSpionage campaign.\n\nThe published hacking tools include:\n\n- \u0007Glimpse (a new version of a PowerShell\nTrojan, which Palo Alto Networks\nnamed BondUpdater);\n\n- \u0007PoisonFrog (an old version\nof BondUpdater);\n\n- \u0007HyperShell (a web shell that Palo\nAlto Networks called TwoFace);\n\n- HighShell (another web shell);\n\n- \u0007Fox Panel (a phishing kit);\n\n- \u0007Webmask (the main tool involved\nin the DNSpionage campaign).\n\nPublished data about 66 victims was\ncollected in some of APT34's backend\ncommand-and-control (C&C) servers\nand contained credentials from internal\nservers and user IP addresses. This victim\nlist mainly includes companies and\norganizations in the Middle East, Africa,\nEast Asia, and Europe.\n\nLab Dookhtegan also leaked data\nabout past APT34 operations, listing\nIP addresses and domains where the\ngroup had hosted web shells and other\noperational data. As of April 18, 2019,\nresearchers were aware of 125 web shells.\n\nIn June, researchers reported an attack\non a Middle East organization conducted\nby the group Turla in January 2018.\nThreat actors used OilRig (Iran)\ninfrastructure to download a customized\n\n[1] https://content.fireeye.com/apt-41/rpt-apt41\n\n\nvariant of Mimikatz—which is unique\nto Turla (Russia)—to the victim’s device.\n\nAs occurred in the OilRig (APT34)\ncase, a Telegram channel was used\nto leak data about another Iran-nexus\ngroup, MuddyWater. The data leaked\nincluded information about the source\ncode of a tool written in Python and its\nC&C servers.\n\nThis tool is designed to generate\na payload embedded in a macro.\nOnce the macro is executed, the\nvictim's computer connects to the\nC&C server and downloads additional\nmodules. This tool also delivers a secondstage payload, e.g. .sct, .hta, and\nPowerShell.\n\n\nIn June 2018, the United States imposed\nsanctions against the Russian research\ninstitute Quantum, a contractor for\nFSB, the Russian intelligence service.\nIn December 2018, the group Digital\nRevolution published data stolen from\nQuantum. In July 2019, hackers breached\nSyTech, another FSB contractor, and\nshared the exfiltrated data about\nthe company’s internal projects and\nscreenshots of SyTech's servers with\nDigital Revolution. The latter released\nthis information online.\n\nIn August 2018, the group Intrusion Truth\nrevealed the identities of individuals\nit claimed were members of the Chinese\nhacking group APT10. In July 2019, the\nsame group shared details of individuals\nthought to be members of the Chinabacked group APT17.\n\nIn August 2019, FireEye released an indepth report about the APT41 group\nduring the BlackHat conference. APT41\nseems to have several ties with APT17,\nwhich is why experts believe that these\nthreat actors are in fact the same group\n(called Winnti or BARIUM).\n\n\n**CODE FAMILY OVERLAP AMONG DIFFERENT CHINESE ESPIONAGE GROUPS[[1]]**\n\nMalware APT1 APT3 APT10 APT17 APT18 APT19 APT40 APT41\n\nBLACKCOFFEE\n\nCHINACHOP\n\nCOLDJAVA\n\nHIGHNOON\n\nHIGHNOON.BIN\n\nHIGHNOON.LITE\n\nHOMEUNIX\n\nJUMPALL\n\n\n-----\n\n### TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR \n###### new challenges and threats\n\n TELECOM-RELATED TARGETING\n\n\n###### HEXANE\n\nThe newly discovered group HEXANE\nattacks telecommunications companies\nin the Middle East, Central Asia, and\nAfrica as a stepping stone in supply\nchain attacks. Its goal is to gain access\nto critical infrastructure belonging to the\norganizations that use the services\nof these telecom companies.\n\n###### Lazarus\n\nThe group Lazarus also spies\non telecommunications companies using\na new backdoor called Rising Sun. The\nlatter collects data about the infected\ndevice, such as IP address, network\ndevice information, OS name and\nversion, system data, and username. The\ncollected data is sent to the C&C server.\nThis backdoor is probably spread as the\nfirst attack stage and may be followed\nby a download of additional malware.\n\n###### Thrip\n\nThe Chinese hacker group Thrip is known\nfor espionage and sabotage attacks.\nIn particular, they target organizations\nin the satellite communications sector.\nThe hackers use the “living off the\nland” technique, which involves using\noperating system features or legitimate\nnetwork administration tools (PsExec,\nMimikatz, WinSCP, and LogMeIn)\nto compromise victims’ networks with\nTrojans.\n\n\nThe telecom industry is a key target\nfor state-sponsored attackers.\nIf they manage to compromise\na telecommunications company,\nattackers then have the opportunity\nto also compromise its customers for\nsurveillance or sabotage purposes.\n\n###### APT10\n\nOne of the most large-scale operations\nduring the reporting period was an attack\ncalled Operation Soft Cell, allegedly\nconducted by the Chinese statesponsored group APT10. The campaign\nhas been active since at least 2012.\n\nThe purpose of the attack was to obtain\nCDR records belonging to a large\ntelecommunications provider. The\nhackers were able to compromise\nusernames and passwords as well\nas billing data, detailed call records,\ncredentials, mail servers, user location,\nand more.\n\nThe attack started with deploying\na modified version of the China Chopper\nweb shell on a vulnerable server. The\nattackers leveraged the Windows\nprocess w3wp.exe, which runs web\napplications and is responsible for\nrequests sent to a web server.\n\nThe attackers used stolen credentials\nto create fraudulent domain user\naccounts with extensive administrator\nprivileges. They then used these\naccounts or deployed the Poison Ivy\nRAT to maintain access to compromised\nresources.\n\n###### MuddyWater\n\nThe state-sponsored group MuddyWater\ngained access to the local network\nof Korek Telecom, a mobile operator\nbased in Erbil, Iraq. Compromising the\noperator was an intermediate stage\nin an attack on the oil and gas company\nMissan Oil Company, which is supposedly\na client of Korek Telecom.\n\n\n###### APT33 (aka Elfin, Magnallium)\n\nIn late 2018, APT33 (aka Elfin,\nMagnallium) resumed its attacks using\na new variant of the Shamoon Trojan.\nThe tool’s first version was discovered\nin 2012; the second version, together\nwith the wave of attacks during which\nit was used, were discovered in 2017.\nShamoon-3 overwrites the master boot\nrecord (MBR), partitions, and files in the\nsystem with random data.\n\nThe updated tool’s first victim was\nSaipem S.p.A., an Italian oil and gas\nindustry contractor. The Shamoon wiper\nwas also detected in attacks on oil,\ngas, telecommunications, and energy\ncompanies as well as government\norganizations in the Middle East and\nSouthern Europe..\n\n###### Chafer (aka APT39)\n\nThe goal of the group Chafer (aka\nAPT39) is to collect personal data for\nfurther user monitoring and tracking\noperations in support of Iranian national\ninterests. The collected data can also\nbe used as a vector for further attacks.\n\nFor initial compromise, the group\nleverages spear-phishing emails with\nmalicious attachments or URLs, usually\nresulting in a POWBAT infection. The\ngroup identifies and exploits vulnerable\nweb servers belonging to targeted\norganizations in order to install web\nshells (e.g. ANTAK and ASPXSPY)\nand uses stolen legitimate credentials\nto compromise externally facing Outlook\nWeb Access (OWA) resources.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### APT 10\n\n WINNTI\n\n REGIN\n\n MUDDY WATER\n\n THRIP\n\n APT33\n\n CHAFER\n\n LAZARUS\n\n HEXANE\n\n|JAN 2012 -|JUN|2019|\n|---|---|---|\n\n|2019 JUN 2|013 - JUN 2013 AN 2019|Col3|JAN JUN 2016 - DE|2017 - APR 2019 SEP 2017 - JAN C 2018 18|MAR 2019 2018 - JUN 2018 APR 2018 - J|UL 2019|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|JUL 2014 - J|||||||\n||||||||\n||||MAR 2016 - NOV 20||||\n||||||||\n\n\n###### 2012\n\n\n###### 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 5G EXPANSION–RELATED CHALLENGES\n\n\nExperts tested ToRPEDO against\nthree Canadian service providers\nand all US service providers.\n\n- \u0007The PIERCER (Persistent Information\nExposure by the Core Network)\nattack allows hackers to link the\nvictim's IMSI to their phone number.\n\n###### New scale of traditional threats\n\nWider adoption of 5G will significantly\nincrease the number of traditional\nattacks that providers have faced\nin recent years:\n\n- \u0007DDoS attacks will become much\nmore frequent and effective due\nto the large number of insecure\ndevices and wide bandwidth.\n\n- \u0007Proxying is another popular scam\nmethod. By turning compromised\ndevices into proxies, hackers can\nuse a large pool of IP addresses\nto attack. This helps them bypass\nsecurity systems to carry out web\nscraping, automated fraud, and traffic\ncheats. Connecting IoT devices\nto 5G networks will significantly\nincrease the number of insecure\ndevices that may be used for proxying.\n\n- \u0007The spread of malware through hacked\ndevices is a popular practice, which\nwill become more large-scale with\nthe development of 5G networks.\n\n\nThe 5G standardization process is not\nscheduled to be completed until 2021,\nbut the first networks have already been\nbuilt. Moreover, active competition\ncurrently exists not only between\ntechnology giants, but also countries\n(USA and China are leading in the field\nof 5G).\n\nPioneers will set the standards and\npractices that will be implemented\nby subsequent players. This will\nboth bring leading countries billions\nin revenue, create new jobs, and offer\nleadership opportunities in technological\ninnovation, as was the case when the\n2/3/4G networks appeared.\n\n###### 5G architectural risks\n\nThe main feature of 5G (unlike 1/2/3/4G)\nis that it is more of a software than\na hardware platform. The equipment\nused in traditional mobile communication\nnetworks has been replaced with\nsoftware entities operating in data\ncenters on standard servers and virtual\nmachines. In addition to virtual machines,\nsoftware containers and the software\narchitecture of microservices will be used\nto implement software functions.\nIt is these architectural features that\nconcern security professionals. All threats\nto server and software solutions are\nnow becoming relevant for 5G network\noperators.\n\n###### Increased attack surface when infrastructure is compromised\n\nNetwork slicing is a form of virtualization\nthat allows multiple logical networks\nto run on top of a shared physical network\ninfrastructure. This approach is used\nto provide various types of 5G services:\nweb or voice traffic transfer, traffic for\naugmented reality applications, etc.\n\nAccess to such network slices is obtained\nby companies seeking to provide\n5G-based services. Although the\naddress pool is logically isolated,\naccess to it increases the attack surface\nsignificantly, which could compromise\nthe entire infrastructure.\n\nAPT groups could start using\nnetwork slicing to conduct BIOS/\nUEFI-related attacks, side channel\nattacks, or supply chain attacks.\nThe goals of state-sponsored\nhackers are likely to be espionage\nor sabotage in order to undermine trust\nin a competitor’s solution.\n\n\n###### Investigations into 5G vulnerabilities\n\nNew challenges and security issues\nlinked to 5G networks are worrying\nexperts worldwide. In the past year,\nseveral studies on this topic have been\npublished:\n\n- \u0007In November 2018, a team\nof researchers from Switzerland,\nFrance, and the United Kingdom\nraised concerns about the\n5G protocol known as Authentication\nand Key Agreement (AKA).\n\n- \u0007In February 2019, a group of university\nresearchers discovered cellular\nnetwork vulnerabilities that impact\nboth 4G and 5G LTE protocols.\nAccording to the paper, the new\nattack method could allow remote\nattackers to bypass security\nprotections implemented in 4G and\n5G, re-enabling IMSI catching devices\n(such as \"Stingrays\") to intercept\nphone calls and track user location.\n\n- \u0007ToRPEDO (\"TRacking via Paging\nmEssage DistributiOn) is the\nmost dangerous attack leveraging\nthe cellular paging protocol.\nIt allows remote attackers to verify\na victim’s coarse-grained location\ninformation, inject fabricated paging\nmessages, and mount denial-ofservice attacks. ToRPEDO is effective\nagainst 4G and 5G LTE protocols.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### BGP HIJACKING AND SS7 THREATS\n\n\nExploitation of SS7 vulnerabilities for\nespionage and fraud purposes has long\nbeen known and continues to be used.\nIn January 2019, UK-based Metro Bank\ncustomers fell victim to a 2FA bypass\nattack. Hackers exploited a vulnerability\nin the SS7 protocol to target bank\naccounts by intercepting text messages\nused as two-factor authentication.\n\nSeveral examples of BGP hijacking were\nlisted at the beginning of this report, but\nthere have been many more incidents\nof this nature.\n\n###### Shut down of the \"BGP hijack factory\" – Portuguese provider Bitcanal\n\nOn June 25, 2018, independent\nsecurity researcher Ronald Guilmette\ndiscovered suspicious activity associated\nwith multiple BGP hijacks. The BGP\nhijacked routes were carried out by the\nPortuguese provider Bitcanal. When\npresented with the most recent evidence\nof hijacks, transit providers immediately\ndisconnected Bitcanal as a customer and\ndeprived it of international transit.\n\nDuring a BGP hijack, Bitcanal announced\nsubnets belonging to Beijing Jingdong\n360 Degree E-commerce. The\nPortuguese provider’s loss of transit also\nresulted in the disconnection of Routed\nSolutions (AS39536), presumably\nBitcanal’s customer or one of its affiliated\ncompanies.\n\n###### BGP/DNS hijacks targeting the payment systems WorldPay, Datawire, and Vantiv\n\nOn July 6, 2018, the provider Digital\nWireless Indonesia (AS38146)\nannounced the following prefixes for\nabout 30 minutes:\n\n**64.243.142.0/24 – Savvis,**\n**64.57.150.0/24 – Vantiv, LLC,**\n**64.57.154.0/24 – Vantiv, LLC,**\n**69.46.100.0/24 – Q9 Networks Inc.,**\n**216.220.36.0/24 – Q9 Networks Inc.**\n\nOn July 10, 2018, Malaysian operator\nExtreme Broadband (AS38182)\nannounced the exact same five prefixes\nlisted above for 30 minutes. An hour later,\nthey were announced again for about\n15 minutes.\n\nOn July 11, 2018, Malaysian operator\nExtreme Broadband (AS38182) began\nannouncing a new set of prefixes:\n\n\n**209.235.25.0/24 – Mercury Payment**\n**Systems, 63.111.40.0/24 – Mercury**\n**Payment Systems, 8.25.204.0/24 –**\n**Level 3, 12.130.236.0/24 –CERFnet**\n\nOn 12 July 2018, AS38182 began\nhijacking the same five routes that had\nbeen targeted twice previously.\n\n**64.243.142.0/24 – Savvis,**\n**64.57.150.0/24 – Vantiv, LLC,**\n**64.57.154.0/24 – Vantiv, LLC,**\n**69.46.100.0/24 – Q9 Networks Inc.,**\n**216.220.36.0/24 – Q9 Networks Inc.**\n\nThis time, the hijack lasted much longer\nthan in the previous cases: the provider\nannounced the prefixes to intercept\ntraffic for almost three hours.\n\nAn hour later, AS38182 began hijacking\nvarious routes for approximately\n10 minutes:\n\n**199.7.68.0/24 – UltraDNS Corporation,**\n**199.7.69.0/24 – UltraDNS Corporation,**\n**204.74.108.0/24 – UltraDNS Corp,**\n**204.74.109.0/24 – Internet Media**\n**Network, 204.74.114.0/24 – Internet**\n**Media Network, 204.74.115.0/24 –**\n**Internet Media Network, 65.118.49.0/24 –**\n**CenturyLink**\n\nThese Internet routing attacks were\npresumably designed to redirect\ntraffic directed at payment processors\nto servers controlled by malicious\nactors who would then attempt to steal\nthe data. Passive DNS observations\nbetween the July 10 and 13 showed\n*.datawire.net domains resolving\nto 45.227.252.17 (AS58271, VSERVERAS, Panama).\n\n###### Multiple cases of traffic misdirection by China Telecom\n\nA joint paper from the U.S. Naval\nCollege and Tel Aviv University (Israel)\nclaims that China Telecom, a Chinese\ntelecommunications company, has\nsystematically hijacked Internet traffic for\nyears by exploiting BGP weaknesses.\n\nOne example cited by the authors\nis route diversions between Canadian\nand South Korean government websites.\nIn 2016, internet traffic was diverted\nby China Telecom and routed through its\nPoP (point of presence) in Toronto, then\nforwarded to its PoP on the West Coast\nof the United States, followed by China\nand finally South Korea.\n\n\nIn 2017, China Telecom intercepted traffic\nbetween Scandinavia and Japan that\ncrossed the United States and redirected\nit to a mail server operated by a large\nThai financial company. According to the\nauthors, after China Telecom copied the\ndata for encryption breaking and analysis,\ntraffic was delivered to the intended\nnetworks within a short time.\n\n###### Attack on public DNS servers  in Taiwan\n\nOn May 15, 2019, researchers\nreported that BGP routes had been\nhijacked to intercept traffic going\nthrough a public DNS run by the\nTaiwan Network Information Center\n(TWNIC). On May 8, 2019, traffic was\nrerouted to the network belonging\nto the Brazilian provider Fibra Plus\nTelecomunicacoes LTDA (AS268869).\nThe incident lasted three and a half\nminutes. On May 8, the Brazilian provider\n(AS268869) started advertising the\nprefix 101.101.101.0/24, which does not\nbelong to it—the move was an attempt\nto hijack the Quad101 prefix. Quad101\nis an experimental Public DNS project\nrun by TWNIC, a ccTLD (country-code\nTop Level Domain) registry operator.\n\n\n-----\n\n### ENERGY SECTOR\n###### state-sponsored groups\n\nIn the energy sector, threat actors usually carry out attacks for espionage purposes. Yet in some cases, critical infrastructure facilities\nwere shut down.\n\n###### 3 countries Covert players Middle East\n\nhave attack tools and experience: Iran, Stuxnet, Dugu, Flame, and the attack is a testing ground for tools used in\nRussia, and North Korea on Venezuela confirm that the most attacks on energy organizations from the\n\ndangerous threats have not yet been times of Stuxnet up until now\nidentified\n\n###### ENERGY SECTOR–ORIENTED GROUPS\n\n|3 countries have attack tools and experience: Iran, Russia, and North Korea|Covert players Stuxnet, Dugu, Flame, and the attack on Venezuela confirm that the most dangerous threats have not yet been identified|Middle East is a testing ground for tools used in attacks on energy organizations from the times of Stuxnet up until now|\n|---|---|---|\n\n\n###### HEXANE\n\nIn 2018, a new group called HEXANE\nwas discovered. Its members focus\non industrial control systems and attack\noil and gas companies in the Middle East\n(mainly Kuwait). The threat actors bypass\nsecurity tools through trusted vendors\nby compromising the software and\ntelecommunications networks belonging\nto their targets.\n\n###### LeafMiner\n\nLeafMiner hackers, believed to be based\nin Iran, use both publicly known tools\n(such as Inception Framework) and\nself-developed programs (Trojan.\nImecab and Backdoor.Sorgu according\nto Symantec’s classification). The\ngroup’s main targets are located in the\nMiddle East.\n\nLeafMiner uses watering hole attacks\nto infiltrate targeted organizations. The\nthreat actors embed malicious links\ninto compromised websites to establish\nan SMB connection and steal Windows\ncredentials. Based on security analyst\nobservations, LeafMiner does not\ndisrupt ICS when gaining initial access\nto organizations’ credentials.\n\n\n###### Xenotime\n\nIn 2018, the hacking group Xenotime\nalso switched to power grids. The\ngroup became known for its malware\ncalled Triton (aka Trisis), which has\nbeen used for attacks on Schneider\nElectric’s Triconex Safety Instrumented\nSystem (SIS) controllers.\n\nIt was later found that Xenotime had\nimproved its malware and that its new\nversion could be used to attack various\nindustrial safety systems. These are\nseparate safety mechanisms that are\nactivated to help manage industrial\nprocesses if they approach unsafe\nconditions such as over-pressurization,\noverspeed, or over-heating.\n\n###### Lazarus\n\nOn September 23, it was reported\nthat the hacking group Lazarus had\ndeveloped a new set of tools, which were\nused in attacks on Indian companies\nbetween late 2018 and the spring\nof 2019. The threat actors successfully\ncompromised the account belonging\nto a senior employee at the headquarters\nof a nuclear organization in the APAC\nregion.\n\n\n###### BlackEnergy\n\nBlackEnergy is one of the most advanced\nenergy sector–oriented groups and\nhas caused disruptions in energy\norganizations more than once. The\ngroup focuses on ICS/SCADA systems\nworldwide. The most damaging incident\noccurred in late 2015, when an attack\ndisrupted electric power supply\nin a region in Ukraine.\n\nIndustroyer, also known\nas CRASHOVERRIDE, remains the\nmain tool used by the hackers. The tool\ngains control over remote terminal units\n(RTU) that manage switches and circuit\nbreakers at power grid substations.\nThe group added BadRabbit and\nVPNFilter to its arsenal in 2017 and 2018,\nrespectively. The latter is designed for\nattacks on routers and contains a module\nfor detecting SCADA systems.\n\n###### Dragonfly\n\nThe group Dragonfly, believed\nto be sponsored by Russia, focuses\non collecting data from energy and\nindustrial facilities. The threat actors\nuse phishing emails to attack individual\nemployees and watering hole attacks\nfor larger-scale thefts of corporate\ncredentials. Dragonfly’s arsenal also\nincludes tools such as Goodor, DorShel,\nand Karagany.\n\n\nAlthough the aforementioned\ngroups were active in the period\ninvestigated, two already known\ngroups, BlackEnergy and Dragonfly,\nshould not be overlooked. The\nhackers redeveloping their tools and\ntechniques for new attacks could\nexplain the lull in their activity.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### HEXANE\n\n APT33\n\n LAZARUS\n\n DRAGONFLY\n\n BLACKENERGY\n\n XENOTIME\n\n LEAFMINER\n\n|JUN 2018 - JUL|2019|\n|---|---|\n\n|APR 2017 - OC|T 2019|\n|---|---|\n\n|FEB 2013 - JU|L 2018|\n|---|---|\n\n|MAY|2014 - JUN 2018|Col3|\n|---|---|---|\n\n|DEC 2|018 - FEB 2019|\n|---|---|\n\n|Col1|Col2|C 2018 APR 2017 - OC N 2017 - JUN 2018|\n|---|---|---|\n|JUN 2016|- DE|C 2018|\n||||\n||JA||\n||||\n\n\n###### 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019\n\n\n-----\n\n### FINANCIAL SECTOR\n###### targeted attacks\n\n EVOLUTION OF THREAT GROUPS AND THE APPEARANCE OF A NEW PLAYER\n\n|5 groups from 3 countries conduct targeted attacks on financial organizations|3 out of 5 groups are Russian speakers and target various regions|Lazarus uses the most interesting theft and penetration methods|\n|---|---|---|\n\n\nThere are currently only five groups\nthat pose a genuine threat to banks\nworldwide: they use various attack\nvectors, are able to reach isolated\nsystems, and withdraw money. Nearly\nevery group has a rich background and\nsome companies and media outlets\noccasionally give these groups new\nnames, but in reality their number\ndoes not change.

The group\nSilentCards is from Kenya and was not\nnoticed by security analysts until 2018.\nAs for Lazarus, the group is believed\nto be sponsored by North Korea.\n\n\nBefore 2018, Russian-speaking groups\nfocused on banks in Russia and other\npost-Soviet countries, but the trend has\nchanged drastically over the past year.\nAttackers now mainly target banks and\norganizations outside the post-Soviet\nregion.\n\n|Col1|Col2|Col3|Internet Bankin Payment Gate ARM CBR (SWIFT anal ATM, Card Proces SWIFT, Payment ATM, Card ARM CBR ng,|g, ARM CBR, SWIFT, ways, Card Processing,|Col6|ATM|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n||||||||\n|||||Trading Terminals, Card Processing, ATM|||\n|||||ARM C (SWIFT og) sing, Gateways Processing, AT|||\n|||ATM, Card Processi ARM CBR|||||\n||||||||\n|AT SW|M, ATM Switch, IFT, Card Processing||||||\n||||||||\n||||||AT|M, Card Processing|\n||||||||\n\n\n**2013** **2014** **2015** **2016** **2017** **2018** **2019**\n\n\n-----\n\n###### • The names of financial organizations are mentioned only if they have been publicly shared.

Silence shifts\ntheir focus to the financial sectors\nin Bulgaria, India, Bangladesh,\nChile, Costa Rica and Ghana.\n\n- \u0007Forecast for the second half\nof 2019 and 2020: the group may\nsignificantly expand the geographical\nscope of their attacks by working\ntogether with other threat actors.\nIn particular, Group‑IB’s incident\nresponse operations in a number\nof banks revealed that Silence has\nalready started paying another\nhacking group (TA505) for\ninstalling its Trojan in banks.\n\n###### Theft method\n\nSilence’s recent targets were\nATMs, on which the group installed\na new version of an ATM Trojan\nand gained remote access to the\nmachine’s dispenser.\n\nIt is worth noting that the threat actors\nhave experience in stealing money\nthrough bank card management systems,\nwhich may have been successfully\napplied during the attack on the\nDutch‑Bangla Bank and banks in Russia\nbefore that.\n\n###### Penetration method\n\nThe group’s only method of breaching\na bank’s security lies in carefully\nprepared, but not targeted, phishing\nemails. The preliminary stage of a Silence\nattack is characterized by “recon”\nemails without any malicious content.\nThis helps create an up-to-date list\nof email addresses and find out what\ncybersecurity solutions the targeted\norganization uses. Phishing emails with\na malicious payload are then sent to the\nupdated list of email addresses.\n\n\nIn mid-2019, SIlence purchased\naccess to banks from TA505.\nGroup‑IB confirmed this fact while\nconducting an incident response\noperation in a Bulgarian bank. Silence\nwill most likely abandon mail-outs and\ncontinue using the services of other\nthreat groups.\n\n###### Tools\n\nThe main tool Silence uses is their\nown framework, named Silence after\nthe group. In late 2018, the hackers\nrevamped their loader called Ivoke,\nwhich:\n\n- became fileless (written in PowerShell);\n\n- \u0007learned how to bypass detection\nsolutions more effectively;\n\n- \u0007started to collect data on targeted\nsystems more actively to help make\ndecisions on whether it is worth\npursuing the attack;\n\n- \u0007had commands pointing\nto Russian words deleted;\n\n- \u0007was fitted with a new feature for\ntransferring files from the infected\nsystem to the C&C server;\n\n- \u0007had the protocol for communicating\nwith the C&C server changed\n\nThe group continues to use Silence.Proxy\nto proxy traffic. In addition, the threat\nactors employ other remote control\ntools, such as DarkVNC and a modified\nversion of AmmyAdmin, which has been\ndubbed FlawedAmmyy. This is a fullfledged remote access Trojan (RAT),\nwhich enables the threat actors to gain\nadministrative control over infected\ndevices in order to monitor user activity,\nprofile the system, and steal credentials.\nSilence is not the only group that uses\nFlawedAmmyy. In particular, hackers\nfrom TA505 have used it in recent\nattacks.\n\nIn the past, Silence used only its own\nunique Trojan called Atmosphere.\nIn 2019, however, the group started using\nnew malware. After successfully testing\nit on IT Bank (Russia), the new tool was\npresumably used for theft at DutchBangla Bank (Bangladesh).\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Geographical scope\n\nCobalt’s last successful theft in Russia\nwas observed in November 2018. It was\nnot until July 2019 that the group\nresumed their attempts to breach\nRussian banks. In the meantime, the\nthreat actors focused on other countries.\nThey sent out phishing emails disguised\nas messages from the European\nBanking Federation, Diebold Nixdorf,\nthe Interkassa e-payment system, SEPA\nEurope, and SWIFT.\n\nIt is worth highlighting the mail-outs\npurporting to be from banks in Europe,\nGreece, India, and Kazakhstan: they\nwere sent from the mail servers\nbelonging to the targeted organizations,\nwhich suggests that either the banks\nor employee email accounts had been\ncompromised.\n\nDespite the mail-outs and other traces\nof activity, there is no publicly available\ninformation about thefts that Cobalt\ncommitted outside Russia. This indicates\nthat there are no informatory procedures\nin place in the regions attacked rather\nthan that there are no attacks.\n\n###### Penetration method\n\nTo breach infrastructures, Cobalt\nengages in phishing by posing as banks,\nfinancial organizations, and their\npartners. After successfully attacking\na bank, the threat actors sometimes\ncontinue using the access they gained\nto send phishing emails under the\nvictim’s name and from the entity’s mail\nservers.\n\nIn October 2018, Group-IB detected\nan attack carried out from the\nsubdomains of a governmental portal\nin Russia, which redirected users\nto servers using the RIG Exploit Kit.\nAs a result, CobaltStrike Beacon was\ninstalled on the victim’s computer. It was\nlater established that this attack resulted\nin a theft from a bank in a post-Soviet\ncountry.\n\n\nIn January 2019, Cobalt started using\na new scheme to spread their malware.\nThe group sent emails using free email\nservices and posing as individuals who\nare well known in financial circles.\n\nAnother important email-related\nchange was higher quality. Earlier texts\nwere poorly phrased and had no decoy\ndocuments attached, but during\nrecent attacks the emails looked much\nmore trustworthy and the malicious\nattachments contained clever baits.\n\n###### Theft method\n\nIn 2018, the threat group used various\ntheft methods: SWIFT, local interbank\ntransfer systems, card processing, and\nthe payment gateways of instant money\ntransfer systems. Interestingly, only\nCobalt has experience in using payment\ngateways for theft, which they only did\nin Russia.\n\n###### Tools\n\nFirst, the targeted company is infected\nwith the modular backdoor CobInt.\nIt launches other modules that collect\nsystem information and download and\nlaunch the main tool for developing the\nattack further. Its main tool is still Cobalt\nStrike, which the group has been using\nsince it started its activity.\n\nAnother tool that Cobalt has been using\nis a JS backdoor that downloads and\nlaunches PE files and executes scripts.\nAs for Cobalt’s Trojans for Windows,\nLinux, and ATMs, they were not used\nin the period investigated.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Geographical scope\n\nIn 2018 and 2019, MoneyTaker was\nobserved to be active only in Russia.\nInitially, its activity had been detected\ndue to their attacks in the US. At the time,\nthe group had remained unnoticed for\nmany years.\n\n###### Penetration method\n\nMoneyTaker uses three main methods for\npenetrating networks:\n\n1. \u0007Vulnerable network equipment.\nOnce the threat actors gain access\nto it, they use a VPN to add their\nserver to the bank’s local network\nand develop the attack further using\nthat server. This vector is very difficult\nto detect, which is why it took experts\na long time to determine how exactly\nMoneyTaker penetrated networks.\n\n2. \u0007Access to a trusted partner’s networks\nby brute forcing the passwords\nof local administrators, with\nfurther attack development.\n\n3. \u0007Phishing emails purporting to be from\nbanks and financial regulators.\n\n###### Geographical scope\n\nSilentCards is a new local threat group\nbased in Kenya. So far, it has attacked\ntargets in its own country only. The\ngroup has been involved in two known\nsuccessful thefts.\n\n###### Penetration method\n\nWe do not have accurate information\nabout the attack methods and vectors\nthat the group uses to penetrate\nnetworks. Neither phishing emails\nnor malicious documents that could\nhave been used to deliver the payload\nhave been discovered. However,\nsome malicious file samples were\nconfigured to work with C&C servers\non the local network. Based on this\ndata, we can assume that the hackers\nalready have a controlled device within\nthe organization that allows them\nto attack the corporate network. This\ncould be either a corporate computer\nor a device brought from outside.\n\n\n###### Theft method\n\nMoneyTaker steals money through\nthe Russian interbank transfer system\nor ATMs using a self-developed ATM\nTrojan, which was created in 2018 and\ndesigned to remotely control ATM\ndispensers. The threat actors grew more\ncautious with the former method; they\nabandoned automation tools and now\ncarry out transactions manually instead.\n\n###### Tools\n\nMetasploit remains MoneyTaker’s main\ntool; the group has been using it since\nthe beginning. The threat actors also\nemploy another popular framework\ncalled PowerSploit, as well as Radmin\nfor remote control and a self-developed\nATM Trojan for theft from ATMs.\n\n###### Theft method\n\nThe threat actors withdraw money\nthrough card processing: they gain\naccess to bank card management\nsystems, change card limits, and\nwithdraw cash from ATMs using cards\nthey obtained in advance.\n\n###### Tools\n\nSilentCards uses self-developed tools,\nMetasploit, and various PowerShell\nscripts to automate certain tasks during\nattacks. The group’s own tools include:\n\n- \u0007keylogger, which sends the\nresults of its activity to an FTP\nserver or email address;\n\n- \u0007battlefield: a shell written in Python\nand packed in .exe using py2exe. Its\ncapabilities include a remote command\nshell, creating and saving screenshots\nto a local disk, and downloading\nfiles from an arbitrary URL.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Geographical scope\n\nLazarus has always been mainly focused\non the Asia-Pacific region. Its attack\non Polish banks in 2017 seemed more like\nan exception rather than the rule.\n\nHowever, in October 2018, HSBC\ndetected an attack on its Maltese office\ncarried out by an unidentified threat\nactor that was named EmpireMonkey.\nIn February 2019, €13 million was stolen\nfrom Bank of Valletta, a Maltese bank.\n\nGroup-IB attributes the attacks\non Maltese banks to Lazarus, which could\nindicate the group’s renewed interest\nin European companies.\n\n###### Penetration method\n\nLazarus uses various vectors and\nsophisticated tools to breach banks:\n\n- \u0007Spear phishing, which\nis used for targeting a very\nsmall group of recipients.\n\n- \u0007Watering hole: By gaining access\nto the websites of financial regulators,\nLazarus attacks the website’s visitors.\nThe malicious code is loaded\nonly if the visitor comes from\na specific pool of IP addresses.\n\n- \u0007Social engineering: The threat actors\nidentify the most suitable employee\non social media and offer them\na job; the employee is prompted\nto download and install a malicious\nprogram at their workplace.\n\n###### Theft method\n\nThe main method Lazarus uses in attacks\non financial organizations is SWIFT.\nThe group has also presumably been\nusing ATM Switch to withdraw money\nsince 2016, with two such thefts in India\nin Chile reported in 2018.\n\n\n###### Tools\n\nThe threat actors continue to use their\nloader (known as Ratankba) for the\nfirst stage of attack. The loader’s first\nPowerShell modification was released\nin 2017, and in 2019 security experts\ndiscovered its updated version. To attack\nApple users, Lazarus created a loader\nthat has been named AppleJeus.\n\nIn late 2018, Client_RAT (aka FALLCHILL,\nManuscrypt), the group’s main Trojan,\nwas also rewritten in PowerShell. Its\nfunctionality is identical to that of the\nprevious version, but it is much more\ndifficult to detect.\n\nTo proxy traffic, the group uses its own\nproxy bot called ClientTraficForwarder,\nbut also employs the well-known\nMetasploit and Cobalt Strike\nframeworks during attacks, which makes\nit more difficult to attribute the attack\nto a specific group.\n\nThe threat actors carry out thefts through\nATM Switch using their own unique\nmalware called Fastcash.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### THEFT THROUGH SWIFT\n\n\nRobbed\n\n**$20 mln**\n\nBancornext Unknown\nMexica Prevented\n**Lazarus**\n**—** **—**\n\nBancornext Unnamed\nMexica Malasya\n**Cobalt** **—**\n\n**$1,7 mln** **$10 mln** **$2 mln** **£13 mln**\n\nPunjab National Bank Banco de Chile Cosmos Bank of Valletta\nIndia Chile India Malta\n**Lazarus** **Lazarus** **Lazarus** **Lazarus**\n\n**$1,87 mln**\n\nCity Union Bank\nIndia\n**Lazarus**\n\n**Jan** **Feb** **Mar** **Apr** **May** **Jun** **Jul** **Aug** **Sep** **Oct** **Nov** **Dec** **Jan** **Feb** **Mar** **Apr** **May** **Jun** **Jul** **Aug** **Sep**\n\n###### 2018 2019\n\n\n**CURRENT THREATS**\n\n\nMost thefts through SWIFT occurred\nin the second half of 2017 and the\nfirst half of 2018, which was followed\nby a lull. Over the period investigated, the\nattackers carried out only two successful\nthefts from banks in India and Malta,\nwith the overall sum stolen amounting\nto $16 million.\n\nOnly two groups, Lazarus and Cobalt,\nhave successfully stolen money through\nSWIFT. As such, when the incident\nin Malta could not be attributed to either,\nsome cybersecurity specialists suggested\nthat there was a “new” group called\nEmpireMonkey. The second incident\n\n\nattributed to this group was an attack\non HSBC’s Maltese office, which was\nsuccessfully halted. Group-IB believes\nthat the group behind these attacks\nis Lazarus.\n\nIn as early as 2017, Lazarus tried\nto attack banks in Europe by using the\nwatering hole penetration method.\nApart from Poland, the threat actors\ncompromised the websites of financial\nregulators in Mexico and Uruguay.\nSecurity specialists managed to locate\na configuration file that specified the\nsubnets of banks in which Lazarus was\ninterested. The file listed the subnets\n\n\nof Mexican banks, Banco de Chile, and\nthe Turkish bank Akbank, which all fell\nvictim to a successful theft a year later,\nand also the HSBC subnets that were\nallegedly attacked by “EmpireMonkey”.\n\nThis shows that, despite fewer thefts\nthrough SWIFT overall, this attack vector\nremains relevant. Moreover, new tools\ndesigned for these types of attack may\nemerge.\n\n\n**FORECAST: THE APPEARANCE OF POWERSHELL-WRITTEN BANSWIFT/BBSWIFT**\n\n\nIn 2016, during the well-known attack\non the central bank of Bangladesh,\nLazarus used a special program called\nBanswift/BBSwift. It allowed the hackers\nto track transactions, modify databases,\nand block the printing of SWIFT\ndocuments.\n\n\nDuring all subsequent incidents,\nthe group abandoned these types\nof automation tools and carried out\ntheft operations manually. The attackers\ncompromised the workstations\nof operators who had legitimate access\nto the SWIFT interface. To withdraw\nmoney, the threat actors used the MT103\nSerial or MT103 Cover messages.\n\n\nOver the past year, Lazarus has\nsignificantly improved its tools, mainly\nby redeveloping them using PowerShell.\nThe group might use an equivalent\nof Banswift/BBSwift written\nin PowerShell in future thefts.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### THEFT THROUGH ATM SWITCH\n\n\nIn 2018, Lazarus attacked Cosmos Bank,\nan Indian bank, which resulted in a twostep money withdrawal process:\n\n- \u0007$11 million was withdrawn from banking\ncustomer accounts with the help\nof third-party individuals using forged\nbank cards in ATMs. Nearly 15,000\nsuch transactions were carried out\nin 28 countries in just seven hours.\nAnother $400,000 was cashed out\nin ATMs using fake cards in India only.\n\n- \u0007$2 million was transferred through\nSWIFT from the bank’s accounts\nto fraudulent accounts in Hong\nKong the next day.\n\n###### The attack described above was  far from the only one:\n\n- \u0007Some of the malicious files related\nto the Cosmos Bank incident\nwere compiled in 2016.\n\n- \u0007After the incident, a customer\ninformed Group-IB that their bank\nin Asia had been attacked in the\nsame way in as early as 2016.\n\n\nThe method used by the threat actors\nat the first stage of attack was named\nFastCash. The scheme seems simple but\nis difficult to implement:\n\n- Obtain access to a bank’s network.\n\n- \u0007Find Switch application servers\nfor handling ATM transactions—\nATM Switch, which runs\non the AIX operating system\nby IBM (similar to UNIX).\n\n- \u0007Compromise these servers and\nupload a command-line utility\nto add the threat actor’s malicious\nlibrary to a running process.\n\n- \u0007In 2017, US-CERT reported that\na similar method had been used\nto steal money through ATMs\nin 30 countries. The announcement\nwas likely related to a 2015\nincident when Lazarus attacked\nan ATM operator in South Korea\nand had access to their network\nand ATMs until February 2017.\n\n\nUsually, requests from ATMs are\nreceived by an application server, which\nruns checks in the bank’s systems\nto determine whether to approve\na money withdrawal. The malicious\ncode intercepted these requests and\nsubstituted responses to approve the\nmoney withdrawal.\n\n- \u0007In addition to Cosmos Bank, 2018 saw\na similar technique being successfully\nused to steal money through Redbanc,\na Chilean interbank network.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### LOGICAL ATTACKS ON ATMS\n\nAs mentioned earlier, three out of five\nactive groups possess ATM Trojans,\nnamely Cobalt, Silence, and MoneyTaker.\nHowever, over the period investigated,\nonly Silence conducted successful\nattacks on ATMs.\n\nThe group had previously used their\nown Trojan called Atmosphere, but\nin February 2019 they employed\na new Trojan in an attack in Russia. The\nmalware’s code indicated that it was\ndesigned for theft in dollars.\n\nThree months later, Silence successfully\nrobbed Dutch-Bangla Bank Limited\n(DBBL), a Bangladeshi bank, presumably\nusing the new Trojan they had tested\nin Russia. Soon thereafter, six Ukranians\nwho had withdrawn the money from\nATMs were arrested.\n\n\nIn addition to the confirmed attack\non DBBL, Silence attempted to steal\nmoney from two other banks (NCC Bank\nand Prime Bank). The banks said that\nfinancial losses had been prevented,\nhowever.\n\nSilence’s new Trojan scans all running\nprocesses for “msxfs.dll” and injects\ncode into the process where the .dll\nfile is detected. The injected code\n\n\nenumerates all threads in the application\nand freezes some of them, likely those\nbelonging to the “msxfs.dll” module.\nInstead of using regular XFS API with\nthe constants WFS_CMD_CDM_\nDENOMINATE and WFS_CMD_CDM_\nDISPENSE, money is withdrawn using\nWFS_CMD_CDM_START_EXCHANGE\nand WFS_CMD_CDM_END_EXCHANGE\nsequentially.\n\n\nIn May 2018, MoneyTaker successfully\ntested their unique Trojan for ATMs\nin Russia, but no other incidents followed.\nUnlike Silence, MoneyTaker’s ATM\nTrojan can interact with the dispenser\nspecifically through XFS API.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### THEFT THROUGH CARD PROCESSING\n\n\nIn 2018, researchers detected an incident\nthat has been linked to the group\nSilentCards. The hackers gained\naccess to a card processing system and\nsuccessfully transferred 400 million\nKenyan shillings by penetrating the\ncorporate network and infiltrating the key\nservers responsible for money transfers.\n\n\n-----\n\n### NON-TARGETED ATTACKS\n###### and threats to banking customers\n\nIn recent years, threat actors have been gradually abandoning banking Trojans, attacks on banking customers have become\nincreasingly simpler from a technical point of view, and each direct theft has caused less damage.\n\nHowever, because financial data is easy to compromise, such incidents have become significantly more frequent. In 2019, JS sniffers\nmade carding one of the fastest-growing threats to online banking customers.\n\n###### COMMON CARDING TRENDS\n\n\nIn recent years, the market for collecting\nbank card data has continued to grow.\nIt can be divided into two segments:\ntextual data (card number, expiration\ndate, cardholder name, address, CVV)\nand dumps (magnetic stripe data).\n\nDumps are collected using skimming\ndevices and Trojans for computers\n\n\nthat are connected to POS terminals.\nTo obtain textual data, hackers use\nphishing websites; banking Trojans for\nPC, Android, and ATMs; and JS sniffers\n(malicious code incorporated into the\nwebsites of online stores or other portals\nwhere users enter their card payment\ndetails). JS sniffers are the main discovery\n\n\nthis year and security experts note a clear\ntrend of their increasing popularity.\n\nOver the period investigated, the\nnumber of compromised cards grew\nfrom 27.1 million to 43.8 million. The\naverage price for textual data increased\nfrom $9 to $14, while the average price\nfor a dump fell from $33 to $22.\n\n\n**Year** **2019** **2018**\n\n**Textual data** **Dumps** **Total** **Textual data** **Dumps** **Total**\n\nTotal number 12,540,190 31,213,941 43,754,131 10,218,489 16,927,777 27,146,266\n\nMarket size $179,159,552 $700,520,520 $879,680,072 $95,590,424 $567,791,443 $663,381,867\n\nMinimum price $0.70 $0.50 $0.75 $0.50\n\nMaximum price $150 $500 $99.99 $295\n\nAverage price $14.29 $22.44 $9.35 $33.54\n\nMedian $13 $12 $8 $25\n\n###### EVOLUTION OF POS THREATS\n\n\nBank card dumps make up about 80%\nof the carding market. Over the period\ninvestigated, cybersecurity specialists\ndetected 31.2 million dumps put up for\nsale, i.e. 46% more than last year.\n\nThe main method of compromising\nmagnetic stripe data is infecting\ncomputers connected to POS terminals\nwith special Trojans that collect bank card\ninformation from RAM.\n\n\nIn the past year, cybersecurity specialists\ndetected four new POS Trojans, which\nhad been actively used in attacks but\nremained unnoticed. The source codes\nof most programs known previously\n(Alina, MajikPos, FrameworkPOS) have\nlong been shared on hacker forums and\ncould be used by anyone.\n\n\n**New Trojans** **Old but still active Trojans**\n\n\nDMSniff\n\nGlitch\n\nBadhatch\n\nRtPOS\n\n\nFrameworkPOS\n\nMajikPos\n\nTinyPOS\n\nUdPOS\n\nAlina\n\n\n-----\n\nA total of 17 major data\nleaks—14 identified and three yet\nunlinked to any company—occurred\nbetween March 2018 and June 2019.\nThe descriptions of the databases found\non card shops mention that much more\n\n\ncompromised data is available than\nwhat has been put up for sale. When\nevaluating this market, Group-IB experts\nonly took into account the data that has\nbeen put up for sale; the actual volume\nof dumps could be even bigger. There\n\n\nare 3.6 million such cards in total, which\naccounts for 11% of their overall number.\nThe rest of the data is posted in small\nbatches, which makes it more difficult\nto link it to major leaks.\n\n\n**Date** **Compromised** **Database names** **Number of cards** **Group**\n**company** **on card shops**\n\n\nMarch 2018 Applebees in Ohio BOSSA, NAIFESI, HYTIRI,\nEXCIRA, PEGASUS,\nGAZZE, ZYLLA, COSMOS,\nTRENZO, SABBIA, WYREX,\nGIRLIX, FANTASI, MCUSTA,\nFURRI, SIMINDI, TEGRITY,\nGAZZAK, VELTEX, FIERCE,\nHISAIS, BAVATA, HAXTI,\nBAZO, ZERCO, TIGGI,\nLYZYN, MUAZA, FIREFEX,\nSERPENTA, SECARMA\n\n\n121 987 \n\nMarch 2018 Zippy’s Restaurants - - \nApril 2018 Saks Fifth Avenue and Lord & BIGBADABOOM-02 1 094 232 Fin7\nTaylor Stores\n\nMay 2018 Chilis ZIPPO 1 582 565 Fin7\n\nJune 2018 PDQ - - \nJuly 2018 - ARABIAN-NIGHTS 603 828 \nAugust 2018 Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen - 567 000 \nAugust 2018 Burgerville - - Fin7\n\nSeptember 2018 - FIERYRAIN 1 225 311 \nOctober 2018 Taco Bueno - - \nNovember 2018 Caribou Coffee - - \nDecember 2018 - BADASS-SANTA 184 927 \nJanuary 2019 Huddle House - - \nJanuary 2019 North Country (NCBP) - - \n\nMarch 2019 Earl Enterprise (Buca\ndi Beppo, Earl of Sandwich,\nPlanet Hollywood)\n\n\nDAVINCI 883 290 \n\nMay 2019 Checkers and Rally’s - - \n\nJune 2019 Cotton Patch Cafe BLACKSPIDER, BENEDICT,\nINTUITION, PERMANENT,\nROOTDIRECTORY, VITAMIN\n\n\n113 500 \n\n-----\n\n###### Difficulties in attributing  major leaks\n\nWhen dumps are identified, almost\nno technical details are available, which\nmakes the attribution process difficult\nand only allows for assumptions about\nwho might be responsible for a particular\nleak.\n\nIn the case of FIN7, the attackers were\nidentified either when an attacked\ncompany named that group specifically\nor when company names were published\nin indictments as part of investigations.\n\nWhen it comes to major leaks, we can\nonly guess the possible links between\n\n\nresponse operations to particular\nincidents and the publication of technical\ndescriptions of new Trojans without\ncompany names being mentioned. For\ninstance:\n\n- \u0007In August 2018, it was reported\nthat Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen\nexperienced a data breach. Later that\nmonth, information about a Trojan\ncalled RtPOS was first published.\n\n- \u0007In March 2019, a response operation\nto the incident at Earl Enterprise\n(Buca di Beppo, Earl of Sandwich,\nPlanet Hollywood) started; in the\nsame month, information about\ntwo new POS Trojans (GlitchPOS\nand DMSniff) appeared.\n\n\n\n- \u0007In June 2019, a month after the\nresponse to the Cotton Patch\nCafe incident, news emerged\nabout the Badhatch Trojan,\nwhich was linked to FIN8.\n\n###### Geographical scope of dump sources\n\nThe main targets for attackers are fast\nfood restaurants in the US. The country\ncomes first in terms of the number\nof compromised cards—close to 93%\nof all dumps. This year, the US is followed\nby Middle Eastern countries (Kuwait,\nPakistan, the UAE, and Qatar), which\ntogether account for 2.38%.\n\n\n**Country** **Number of dumps** **Percentage (%)**\n\nUS 29,121,383 93,30\n\nKuwait 359,037 1,15\n\nPakistan 261,901 0,76\n\nUK 238,186 0,47\n\nCanada 145,366 0,47\n\nChina 119,807 0,38\n\nBrazil 95,344 0,31\n\nUAE 87,447 0,28\n\nRepublic of Korea 64,946 0,21\n\nQatar 59,364 0,19\n\nOther countries 661,178 2,12\n\n\n###### Possible reasons for the Middle Eastern anomaly\n\nThanks to proprietary infrastructure\nfor monitoring underground forums\nand card shops, Group-IB sees the\nfull picture of the carding market and\ndetects anomalies therein. In the period\ninvestigated, there was an unusual rise\nin the number of compromised Pakistani\nbank cards, which almost no one sold\nbefore October 2018.\n\nOn October 26, a database containing\n10,467 dumps was put up for sale, with\n8,704 of them belonging to Pakistani\nbanks, including BankIslami. Two days\nlater, BankIslami announced that\non October 27, attackers withdrew about\n$2.6 million from the bank’s accounts.\n\n\nAfter the news was shared, another two\ndatabases with Pakistani bank data were\npublished:\n\n- October 31, 2018 — 11,795 dumps;\n\n- November 13, 2018 — 177,878 dumps.\n\nA total of 150,632 dumps of Pakistani\ncards were put up for sale. This was only\nthe first wave, however.\n\nOn January 24, a small-scale database\nappeared with 1,535 dumps; 96%\nof the cards in it had been issued\nby the Pakistani bank Meezan Bank\nLtd. On January 30, a large database\nof 67,654 dumps emerged.\n\nWhat distinguished this database from\nprevious ones was that it contained\nPIN codes. Obtaining dumps with\nPIN codes usually requires hardware\n\n\nskimming equipment, but the amount\nof data collected that way is always small.\nAnother option is to compromise a bank\nthat does not comply with international\nsecurity requirements and stores PIN\ncode information.\n\nOn January 16, a file called\n“ApplicationPDF.exe” was uploaded\nto VirusTotal from Pakistan. The file\nis a malicious program created by the\nthreat group Lazarus, which the threat\nactors send to bank employees after\ninteracting with them on social media.\nA similar program was used for gaining\naccess during the attack on Redbanc,\na Chilean interbank network. The file\nuploaded to VirusTotal was compiled\non October 31, 2018 and cannot be linked\nto the 2018 leaks, but it can explain the\nincidents in 2019.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### NEW TREND: JS SNIFFERS\n\n\nJS sniffers are one of the most effective\nmethods of compromising bank cards.\nA sniffer is a type of malicious code\nthat threat actors incorporate into their\nvictims’ websites to intercept data\nentered by users, such as bank card\nnumbers, names, addresses, logins,\nand passwords. Threat actors sell\nthe payment data they obtain or use\nit themselves to buy valuable goods.\n\nRiskIQ, together with Flashpoint, were\nthe first to analyze the activities of threat\nactors that use sniffers. They singled\n\n\nout 12 groups and gave them a common\nname: MageCart. Group-IB analyzed\nthe discovered sniffers, and—by applying\nproprietary analytical systems—exposed\nthe entire infrastructure and gained\naccess to the threat actors’ source\ncodes and tools. This approach helped\ndetect at least 38 different sniffer\nfamilies as at spring 2019. At the time\nof publishing this report, that number has\ngrown.\n\n\nEach sniffer family has unique\ncharacteristics and is most likely\nmanaged by different individuals. As all\nsniffers have similar functionalities,\nit is not practical for the same threat\ngroup to create two different sniffers.\n\n\n**List of JS-sniffer families analyzed in this report: 15 out of 38 discovered by Group-IB team**\n\nTokenLogin March 2016 Illum End of 2016 MagnetoName December 2017\n\nTokenMSN Mid 2016 WebRank End of 2016 ImageID End of 2017\n\nG-Analytics September 2016 ReactGet June 2017 GetBilling Start of 2018\n\nPreMage November 2016 PostEval Mid 2017 Qoogle April 2018\n\nFakeCDN November 2016 CoffeMokko September 2017 GMO May 2018\n\n\n###### How sniffers work\n\nStep 1: Gain access to a website\n\n- \u0007Option 1 — Gain access\nto the administrator panel by using\npassword-stealing malware.\n\n- \u0007Option 2 — Search for vulnerable\nwebsites (exploits of popular CMSs;\nknown vulnerabilities of service\nproviders). By using exploits, threat\nactors load a web shell, gain access\nto a website, and modify its files.\n\n- \u0007Option 3 — Purchase access\nto a website from another threat group.\n\nStep 2: Acquire a JS sniffer\n\n- Option 1 — Develop a JS sniffer.\n\n- \u0007Option 2 — Buy or rent a ready-made\nsolution on an underground forum.\n\nStep 3: Install a sniffer\n\nInstalled via a control panel or web shell,\na JS sniffer collects data and sends\nit to a host managed by the threat actor.\nSome sniffers use techniques that allow\nthem to remain unnoticed during manual\nchecks:\n\n- Add it to a legitimate script library.\n\n- \u0007Suspend JS sniffer activity\nwhen the developer console\nis being used (e.g. Chrome DevTools\nor Firefox Browser Toolbox).\n\n\nStep 4: Monetization\n\n- \u0007Option 1: Sell data to carders for\n$1–$5 per card. This is the easiest\nmethod as only the contact details\nof verified buyers are needed.\n\n- \u0007Option 2: Use stolen cards\nto purchase easily re-sellable\ngoods, such as gadgets, electronics,\nhome appliances, interior\nitems, clothes, and shoes.\n\nCollected payment and the\nvictim’s personal data are sent to the\nthreat actors’ server (a gate). To make\nit more complicated to detect the\nthreat actors’ server, the JS sniffer\nchain uses many levels of gates located\non different servers or hacked websites.\nIn some cases, however, the admin panel\nis located on the same host as the gate\nthat is used for collecting stolen data.\n\nThe threat actor's end server for\ntracking JS sniffer activity and exporting\nstolen data can be either a full-feature\nadministrator panel or a server for\nhosting database administration tools.\nFor example, administrator panel\nfeatures can be performed by tools such\nas Adminer or phpMyAdmin.\n\n\n**User**\n\n\n**Infection**\n**online store**\n\n**JS sniffer`s** **Payment**\n**Gate** **Gateway**\n\n\n**JS sniffer`s**\n**Administration panel**\n\n\n**Cybercriminal**\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Infection methods\n\nThreat actors use various methods\nto infect websites and inject malicious\ncode.\n\n###### Exploitation of CMS vulnerabilities\n\nMalicious code can be injected into\nthe code of online store websites\nby exploiting vulnerabilities in CMSs\ndeveloped specifically for online stores—\nMagento, OpenCart, and others.\n\n- \u0007Loading a web shell on a website\nby exploiting a vulnerability,\nwith subsequent changes\nto the website files.\n\n- \u0007Injecting the JS sniffer code\nby exploiting a vulnerability that allows\nmalicious code to be added to one\nof the site code blocks (e.g. a footer).\n\n###### Hacking of a website’s administrator panel\n\nJS sniffers can be installed by obtaining\naccess to a website’s administrator panel\nwith permission to edit files. The login and\npassword can be compromised through\nseveral methods:\n\n- \u0007stealers, i.e. programs that extract\npasswords saved in browsers;\n\n- \u0007malware for intercepting entered data\n(including logins and passwords);\n\n- brute force.\n\n###### Hacking of third-party services\n\nA sniffer can infiltrate a website through\nhacked third-party services, whose\nscripts work on the target website:\n\n- \u0007Hacking websites that provide\nservices for online stores (customer\nsupport chats or analytics and\nstatistics systems). By injecting\nmalicious code into the service\nscript code, a JS sniffer infiltrates\nthe code of online store websites.\n\n- \u0007Hacking the accounts of CDN services,\nwith the ability to modify scripts\nloaded from CDN to target websites.\n\n###### Supply chain attacks\n\nThe threat group that used the WebRank\nJS sniffer family often carried out attacks\non third-party sites that provided various\nservices for other websites. For example,\nby hacking into a web analytics system,\n\n\n**Other** **Magneto**\n\n###### 16,9% 67,6%\n\n**Shopify**\n\n**eSyndiCat** **1,9%**\n\n###### 2,3%\n\n**WordPress**\n\n###### 5,3%\n\n**OpenCart**\n\n###### 6,0%\n\nthe threat actors injected the JS sniffer\ncode into the web analytics script. The\nscript, which is loaded by many sites,\nwould load a bank card JS sniffer along\nwith itself.\n\nThis type of malware delivery can result\nin rival sniffer families being hacked. For\ninstance, during one wave of infections,\nthe operators of the WebRank sniffer\ngained access to the MagentoName\nJS sniffer code and added their malicious\ncode to it.\n\nAnother example is the attack on Feedify,\na real-time push notification service.\nBy injecting the JS sniffer code into\nthe code of a given file, the threat\nactor automatically uploaded the\nJS sniffer to all Feedify customers,\nand their sites were infected with the\nfeedbackembad-min-1.0.js script. The\nsniffer was injected into the Feedify\ncode on August 17, and was detected\nand removed on September 11. However,\nthe intruders infected the website again\non September 12.\n\nSupply chain attacks have proven\nsuccessful: more than 60% of the 300\nsites that download the Feedify script are\ne-commerce and therefore targets for\nthe WebRank JS sniffer family.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Target payment systems\n\nIn terms of architecture, each JS sniffer\nhas a client and a server part.\n\nThe client part of the JS sniffer\nis responsible for initial data\ncollection, which can be carried\nout in various ways:\n\n  - \u0007On a hardcoded list of names\nof payment form fields for\nvarious payment systems;\n\n  - \u0007Using a list of regular\nexpressions that define fields\nof interest to the JS sniffer and\ncontain sensitive information;\n\n  - \u0007According to the list\nof basic HTML elements\nused in the payment form.\n\nThe server part is the application\nthat the JS sniffer operator works\nwith.\n\nThe functions performed by the\nserver depend on how accurately\nthe client part determines the\ntype of data stolen. If the data\nis transmitted in an unprocessed\nform, the card number, CVV,\nexpiration date, etc. are identified\nin the administrative panel.\n\nProcessing data in the administrative\npanel is the most convenient option\nas it is easier for hackers to make\nchanges to the administrative panel code\nif necessary rather than to change the\ncode of the JS sniffer injected into the\nonline store website.\n\nMany JS sniffer families are not universal,\nhowever, and use unique options for\neach payment system, which requires\nmodifying and testing the script before\neach infection.\n\n###### Universal JS sniffers\n\n- Universal JS sniffer families steal\ninformation from payment forms and\ndo not require modifications tailored\nto specific websites. G-Analytics and\nWebRank JS sniffer families collect all\nthe content from the hardcoded list\nof HTML elements, which means that\n\n\nall the collected information is parsed\nin the administrative panels of these\nJS sniffers, on the server side.\n\n- \u0007WebRank JS sniffers search for\nelements such as “text”, “a”, “button”,\n“input”, “submit”, and “form” and create\nspecific event handlers for them all.\n\n- \u0007G-Analytics JS sniffers search for\nelements such as \"input\", \"select\",\n\"textarea\", and \"checkbox\". If the\nsearch results contain data matching\nthe credit card number’s regular\nexpression, the JS sniffer sends this\ninformation to the attackers’ server.\n\n###### JS sniffers for specific CMSs\n\nMost JS sniffer families detected were\ndeveloped to steal information from the\npayment forms within a specific CMS.\nThese JS sniffers search for specific fields\nby the list of names hardcoded in the\nJS sniffer source code. The fields could\ncontain the victim’s payment information.\n\nThe following JS sniffer families search\ndefault Magento fields:\n\n- PreMage;\n\n- MagentoName;\n\n- FakeCDN;\n\n- Qoogle.\n\nThe GetBilling JS sniffer family\nalso targets Magento websites, but\nit searches by name for forms, not fields.\nThe PostEval JS sniffer family targets\nOpenCart websites. These JS sniffers\nuse a hardcoded list of names that\ncorrespond to the fields in a payment\nform. The list of field names is used\nto search for the victim’s payment\ninformation.\n\n###### JS sniffer as a service\n\nEach individual JS sniffer family can\nrepresent a different service. When\nanalyzing underground forums\nintended for communication between\ncybercriminals, experts discovered\na large number of services offering\na comprehensive solution, including:\n\n- \u0007JS sniffer or utility for\ngenerating JS sniffers;\n\n- \u0007administrative panel for data\nprocessing and tracking\nJS sniffer activity;\n\n- manuals for infecting online store sites;\n\n- ready-made exploits to infect sites;\n\n- \u0007auxiliary utilities for vulnerability\nsearches and mass website infections.\n\n\nAnalysis of some JS sniffer families\nshowed that, in some cases, the domains\nused to store the JS sniffer code and\ncollect stolen data had been registered\nby different users. In other cases, the\ncode had been modified and various\nobfuscation methods and malicious\nactivity concealment techniques\nhad been used. This could indicate\nthat a separate family of JS sniffers\nis used by different threat actors, i.e.\nit is delivered as a service.\n\nIn other cases, a given threat\nactor’s activities were clearly observed,\nwhich could mean that it acts\nindependently of outside developers\nand uses exclusively its own products.\nThis implies that such threat actors\nhave at least one member with web\ndevelopment skills and knowledge\nof languages such as HTML, JavaScript,\nand PHP.\n\nThe cost of JS sniffers\n\n\u0007The cost of JS sniffers ranges\nfrom $250 to $5,000. Some\nservices offer the option\nto work in partnership: the client\nprovides access to the store and\nreceives 80% of the revenue,\nwhile the JS sniffer developer\nis responsible for providing hosting\nservers, technical support, and\nan administrative panel for the\nclient.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Infection scale and victims\n\nThe JS sniffer families detected were\nused to infect at least 2,440 online stores\nthat accept payment by bank card. The\ntotal daily number of visitors to all the\ninfected websites is more than 1.5 million\npeople.\n\n\nJS sniffers that are used to conduct\nthe most large-scale attacks\n\nDue to mass website infections\n(with the most visitors\nto sites infected by the families\nMagentoName and CoffeMokko),\nevery day more than 440,000\npeople visit the websites infected\nwith these JS sniffers. The\nJS sniffer family that comes third\nin terms of the number of websites\ninfected is WebRank, accounting\nfor 250,000 visitors.\n\n**MagnetoName**\n\n###### 57,757,7%\n\n\nMagnetoName 446 272\n\nCoffeMokko 440 776\n\nWebRank 259 953\n\nReactGet 192 329\n\nImageID 167 896\n\nIllum 79 330\n\nG-Analytics 52 114\n\nTokenLogin 37 152\n\nTokenMSN 28 137\n\nGMO 16 206\n\nPostEval 10 449\n\nQoogle 4 059\n\nPreMage 3 966\n\nFakeCDN 3 374\n\nGetBilling 2 659\n\n\nAnalysis of the sites showed that\nmore than half were infected with\nMagentoName, whose operators use\nvulnerabilities to inject malicious code\ninto the code of sites running on older\nversions of the CMS Magento. More than\n13% of infections involve WebRank, which\nis used in attacks on third-party services\nto inject malicious code into target sites.\nMoreover, 11% are infected by JS sniffers\nbelonging to the CoffeMokko family,\nwhose operators use obfuscated scripts\nthat search payment forms for specific\nfields by the list of names hardcoded\nin the JS sniffer source code. Such fields\ncould contain the victim’s payment\ninformation.\n\nBased on an analysis of the list of TLDs\n(top-level domains) of infected online\nstores, it can be concluded that attackers\nare generally interested in infecting\nwebsites from major developed\ncountries: the USA, the UK, Germany, etc.\n\n\nThe average number of visitors\nto infected websites for each JS sniffer\nfamily shows which JS sniffers are\nused to infect the most popular online\nstores. The average number of visitors\nto websites infected with Illum,\nG-Analytics, and TokenMSN is about\n3,000 people per day per site, while for\nMagentoName it is about 500 people.\n\n**Other**\n\n**ImageID** **5,9%**\n\n\n-----\n\nSimilarly to attacks on POS terminals,\nattackers mainly target banking\ncustomers in the USA. UK banks rank\nsecond, mainly due to a successful attack\non British Airways in late 2018 during\nwhich its resources were infected with\na JS sniffer. As a result, a $229 million fine\nwas imposed on British Airways for data\nleaks relating to more than 300,000\ncards.\n\n**Other**\n\n###### 16,6%\n\n.br\n\n###### 2,0%\n\n.in\n\n###### 2,2%\n\n.net\n\n###### 2,5%\n\n.de\n\n###### 2,9%\n\n.au\n\n###### 2,9%\n\n.uk\n\n###### 6,0%\n\n\nAnalysis showed that there are\n11 JS sniffer families that are behind the\nattacks on Asian website users:\n\n- MagentoName;\n\n- Inter;\n\n- addtoev Group;\n\n- Qoogle;\n\n- Illum;\n\n- CoffeMokko;\n\n- EUTag;\n\n- WebRank;\n\n- ImageID;\n\n- TokenLogin;\n\n- OnlineStatus.\n\n\nThe attackers mainly focused on websites\nof companies based in Singapore, China,\nand Malaysia.\n\n**Country** **Number of websites**\n\nSingapore 24\n\nChina 17\n\nMalaysia 15\n\nIndonesia 6\n\nVietnam 4\n\nThailand 4\n\nThe Philippines 4\n\n\n-----\n\n###### WEB PHISHING AND SOCIAL ENGINEERING\n\n\nWeb phishing, one of the oldest and\nsimplest types of fraud, is often used\nby attackers of all kinds. It is gradually\nreplacing complex attacks involving\nexpensive Trojans or hacking tools.\n\nOne of the reasons that web phishing\nattacks are so popular is because they\nare easy to conduct despite the fact that\nthey are continuously changing. Having\nanalyzed over three million links and\n27,000 unique phishing kits over the past\nyear, Group-IB experts identified the\nmain trends in this threat’s evolution.\n\n###### Anti-evasion techniques\n\nGiven that more and more companies\nprovide services for blocking phishing\nwebsites, phishing kit developers tend\nto sell them with built-in anti-evasion\nmechanisms:\n\n- \u0007Blocking by subnet: If a page request\nis sent from a subnets belonging\nto a company that provides phishing\ndetection services, phishing\ncontent will not be shown.\n\n- \u0007Blocking by user agent: Attackers\nanalyze the user agent and try\nto understand if the user is real.\nFor example, if the attack targets\nmobile device users, then visitors\nusing PC browsers will not receive\nphishing pages. Usually, phishing\nscripts check the user agent field\nby a list of predefined keywords.\n\n\n\n- \u0007Blocking by region: Attackers actively\nuse GeoIP databases; if users are not\nlocated in the targeted region, they will\nnot be forwarded to the phishing page.\n\n- \u0007Redirection to official websites:\nSpecial checks help attackers\nidentify suspicious users and\nredirect them to the attacked\nbrand’s official website or the website\nof another legitimate service instead\nof displaying phishing content.\n\n###### DNS hijacking\n\nLast year’s Group-IB Hi-Tech Crime\nTrends report predicted that DNS\nhijacking would actively evolve to help\nconduct phishing attacks even more\neffectively. Below is a reminder of how\nthis method works.\n\n1. \u0007Access the router in one of the\nfollowing ways:\n\n - \u0007Brute-force attacks: Companies\nthat provide routers for rent do not\ncare much about their security\nlevel, set default passwords, and\nenable access to their management\ninterfaces via the Internet.\n\n - \u0007Exploitation of known\nvulnerabilities: Updating home\nrouters is not easy. The support\ncycle for such devices is very short,\nand updates are often unavailable.\nEven in cases where updates\nexist, users rarely install them.\n\n\n2. \u0007Change the device DNS settings\nby writing the addresses of the hackercontrolled DNS servers into the router\nconfiguration. This means that instead\nof returning the IP address of the\nwebsite that the user wants to visit (for\nexample, an online banking page), the\nmalicious DNS server returns a forged\nIP address. In other words, malefactors\ntrick the browser into loading\na phishing webpage instead of the\nwebsite the user was looking for.\n\nIn September 2018, Qihoo 360\ndiscovered a mass campaign. In one\nweek, the security company identified\nmore than 100,000 compromised\nrouters, most of which were located\nin Brazil. The threat, called GhostDNS,\nwas active at least until May 2019. The\ncampaign mainly targeted customers\nof several banks in Brazil and the Netflix\nservice.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Phishing admin panel for a fake Amazon website** **Phishing admin panel for a fake Apple website**\n\n\nOnce the victim's data is collected,\nphishers usually perform one of the\nfollowing actions:\n\n- \u0007Send data via email (still the\nmost popular method).\n\n- \u0007Save data to a local text file, which\nthe criminal can retrieve from\na remote server in various ways.\n\n- \u0007Upload logs to a remote\nFTP server (rare).\n\nGiven that security systems have\nevolved, however, criminals must handle\ndata in real time. Moreover, in an effort\nto attract customers, criminals providing\nphishing as a service started offering\nuser-friendly management systems.\n\n\n**Admin panel for a banking phishing website**\n\nPhishers targeting banking customers\nhave started using panels for managing\nweb injects more actively. The panels\nhelp conduct attacks in real time, receive\none-time passwords from victims, and\nperform additional actions to confirm\nfinancial transactions. One of the most\npopular panels is U-Admin.\n\n\n**Admin panel targeting Russian banks**\n\n**Automated phishing framework**\n\n\n-----\n\nAn interesting example of phishing\nautomation was a phishing campaign\nthat targeted more than 200 banks,\nuniversities, and companies to collect\nemail addresses and passwords. Its\nparticularity was that the framework used\nwas automatically tailored to each victim.\n\n1. \u0007Links to the phishing page\nwere sent via email.\n\n2. \u0007If the victim clicked on the link,\ninformation about the email address\nfrom which the link was followed\nwas marked as a parameter.\n\n3. \u0007The phishing page scripts checked\nthe domain in the email address\nand made an API request to the\nserver to obtain data to be displayed\non the phishing page.\n\n4. \u0007By domain, the server determined\nwhether the user was of interest\nand which logo should be used\non the phishing page.\n\n###### Growth of social engineering attacks without the use of malware\n\nSocial engineering without using malware\nor phishing websites remains one of the\nmost widespread and popular schemes.\nCriminals have always used phone\ncalls, text messages, and social media\nto communicate with victims. As a result,\nthe victim provides the scammer with\nall the necessary information or installs\nremote access programs on their PC that\nhelp the attacker perform fraudulent\nactivity. A new, unprecedented scheme\nthat appeared this year tricks victims into\ninstalling remote control tools on their\nmobile device instead of their PC.\n\n\n5. \u0007If the user was of interest, the\nvictim was redirected to further\npages after entering the login and\npassword on the phishing page.\n\nA typical fraud scenario involves the\nfollowing:\n\n- \u0007The hacker calls posing as a bank\nemployee and informs the customer\nthat an attempt has been made\nto break into their online banking\naccount or withdraw funds.\n\n- \u0007The customer is told that the\nbank’s security team needs\nhelp with solving a technical\nissue to counter the fraud.\n\n- \u0007The victim is asked to urgently\ninstall a remote control tool on their\nsmartphone to protect the user.\n\n- \u0007Having obtained control of the\ndevice, the criminal withdraws funds\nthrough the mobile banking app.\n\n\nDuring calls, criminals use various tricks,\nsome of which are highly convincing,\nto win the victim's trust:\n\n- \u0007They make calls from official\nbank numbers using IP telephony\nby replacing the phone number\nthrough special programs.\n\n- \u0007They provide the transaction\nhistory and other information about\nthe customer, for example where\nthe victim lives (databases with\nsuch information are available for\npurchase on darknet forums).\n\n\n-----\n\n###### ATM TROJANS\n\nThe main and most dangerous threat\nto ATMs is logical attacks. As the final\nstage of targeted campaigns, logical\nattacks result in gaining remote control\nover ATMs. However, such schemes are\nonly available to advanced attackers.\n\nLow-skilled actors must still gain physical\naccess to ATMs to steal money. Their\nmain limitation is the ability to attack\nonly one ATM at a time, so the potential\ndamage from such threats is much lower.\n\nMalware is downloaded to specific\nATMs using CD-ROMs, USB flash\ndrives, or Raspberry Pi devices. Such\n“jackpotting” attacks require the\ninvolvement of three types of criminals:\norganizer/customer, software developer,\nand money mules.\n\nCompared to logical attacks, the\nlandscape of such threats is much\nsmaller. It continues to evolve actively.\n\n###### JavaDispCash\n\nThis Trojan was uploaded to VirusTotal\nfirst from Colombia, then from Mexico.\nUnlike similar tools, it infiltrates the\nATM application via JAVA Attach API\ninstead of using CNG, XFS, or JXFS. The\napproach to command and control is also\nunusual: an HTTP server is launched\non the ATM, which interprets certain\npaths as commands.\n\n\n/eva Check the transferred code on the ATM\n\n/mgr Show the list of all running classes in the attached Java virtual\nmachine, allowing the threat actor to call any function with arbitrary\narguments\n\n/core Upload a .jar file from the victim's file system\n\n/root Accept a POST request and forward its contents to cmd.exe for\nexecution\n\n\n###### New threats\n\n**Unnamed Trojan from Africa**\n\nIn April 2019, Group-IB experts\ndiscovered an interesting sample\nof an ATM Trojan from Africa. The\nprogram is designed to control ATMs\nthrough the pinpad: when the correct\nPIN code is entered, it interacts with the\ndispenser directly, and when a bank card\nwith a certain number is used, the threat\nactor can deplete the entire ATM.\n\nTo bypass whitelists, attackers used the\ncmd.dll file, which is similar to the cmd.\nexe command-line interpreter used\nin the ReactOS operating system.\n\n**Path** **Command description**\n\n/d Dispense banknotes\n\n\n**HelloWorld**\n\nIn January 2019, a user with the\nnickname “gookee” made a post on the\nunderground forum exploit.in about\nthe sale of new malware. The name\n“HelloWorld” was mentioned in the topic\nabout the sale of its previous, unfinished\nversion. The following versions of the\nprogram were for sale:\n\n- \u0007an executable file similar to “Cutlet\nMaker”, with a keygen or without;\n\n- \u0007an IMG image for saving\nit onto a flash drive;\n\n- a CD image;\n\n- a floppy disk image;\n\n- \u0007an ISO image for booting via\nPXE (under development).\n\nThe Trojan runs on all Wincor/Diebold\nNixdorf models released after 2001,\nwhich have MXFS/CSCW DLL files. The\ncost of the program is $2,000 for an .EXE\nfile or image, $3,000 for all options, and\n$10,000 for source codes.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Evolution of АТМ Trojans\n\n**Cutlet Maker**\n\nCutlet is one of the most widespread\nATM Trojans available for free. The tool\nhas been active since mid-2017. To date,\nmultiple malware variants have been\nspotted on hacking forums.\n\nIn December 2018, yet another version\nwas posted on a Russian-speaking forum.\nCutlet has been used to successfully\nattack Europe as well as Russia, and other\npost-Soviet countries.\n\n**WinPot (Cutlet V2)**\n\nIn May 2018, a user with the nickname\n“sl111” made a post on an underground\nforum about the sale of an ATM Trojan\nfor Wincor called “Cutlet Maker v2” (aka\nWinPot). The Trojan is sold as a bundle\ntogether with its source code. The cost\nof the program varies from 500 to 1,000\nUS dollars. Like its predecessor, the\nTrojan has been used to attack ATMs\nin Europe.\n\n**Cutlet Maker**\n\n**ATMii**\n\n\n**Ploutus**\n\nThis malware was originally for sale\nin 2016. It had been used in Mexico for\na long time; in 2018, it appeared in the\nUSA. Despite its age, Ploutus is still\nactive; since 2019, ads about its sale have\nbeen posted on hacker forums regularly.\n\n**ATMii**\n\nATMii was first discovered in April 2017.\nIts distinctive feature was targeting\nonly ATMs running on Windows 7 and\nWindows Vista. The malware's approach\nwas very peculiar because most\nATMs used Windows XP at the time.\nIn December 2018, ATMii was also\npublished on a Russian-speaking hacker\nforum.\n\n**WinPot (Cutlet V2)**\n\n**Alice**\n\n\n**Alice**\n\nThis Trojan has been known since\nNovember 2016. The tool reappeared\non underground forums in December\n2018, as had ATMii. Compared to the\nfree tool Cutlet Maker, Alice is less\nuser-friendly and has not been observed\nin attacks over the reporting period.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### PC TROJANS\n\nThe trend towards a decrease in the\nactivity of banking Trojans for PCs has\nonly intensified. Criminals have stopped\ndeveloping new theft techniques\ninvolving PC Trojans. The only\ncountry where these Trojans continue\nto be developed is Brazil.\n\n###### Old\n\nBackSwap, IcedID, Qbot, Gozi (ISFB,\nUrsnif), Trickbot, TinyNuke (aka NukeBot),\nGootkit,, Buhtrap, Dridex, Ramnit, Panda\nBanker, Retefe, Danabot, Osiris, Loki PWS\n\nBackSwap\n\nIcedID\n\nQbot\n\nGozi (ISFB, Ursnif)\n\nTrickbot\n\nTinyNuke (aka NukeBot)\n\nGootkit\n\nRTM\n\nButhrap\n\nDridex\n\nLokiPWS\n\nRamnit\n\nPanda Banker\n\nRetefe\n\nDanaBot\n\nOsiris\n\nBANKER.THBAIAI\n\nCamuBot\n\n[global]\n\n\nThe target list has not changed. Owners\nof banking botnets mainly focus\non 18 countries: Australia, Austria,\nBulgaria, Brazil, the UK, Germany, Spain,\nItaly, Canada, the Netherlands, Norway,\nPoland, Russia, the USA, Ukraine, France,\n\n\nSwitzerland, and Japan. The most active\nTrojans remain local, attacking users\nin 2 or 3 countries.\n\n|Old BackSwap, IcedID, Qbot, Gozi (ISFB, Ursnif), Trickbot, TinyNuke (aka NukeBot), Gootkit, , Buhtrap, Dridex, Ramnit, Panda Banker, Retefe, Danabot, Osiris, Loki PWS|New BANKER.THBAIAI, CamuBot|Disappeared Zeus, ZeusVM, Atmos, Corebot, UrlZone, Xbot, Toplel|\n|---|---|---|\n\n|Col1|Poland|Spain|USA|Canada|United Kingdom|The Netherlands|Germany|Bulgaria|Australia|Austria|France|post-Soviet countries|Russia|Japan|Switzerland|Norway|Ukraine|Brazil|Taiwan|Italy|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|BackSwap|||||||||||||||||||||\n|IcedID|||||||||||||||||||||\n|Qbot|||||||||||||||||||||\n|Gozi (ISFB, Ursnif)|||||||||||||||||||||\n|Trickbot|||||||||||||||||||||\n|TinyNuke (aka NukeBot)|||||||||||||||||||||\n|Gootkit|||||||||||||||||||||\n|RTM|||||||||||||||||||||\n|Buthrap|||||||||||||||||||||\n|Dridex|||||||||||||||||||||\n|LokiPWS|||||||||||||||||||||\n|Ramnit|||||||||||||||||||||\n|Panda Banker|||||||||||||||||||||\n|Retefe|||||||||||||||||||||\n|DanaBot|||||||||||||||||||||\n|Osiris|||||||||||||||||||||\n|BANKER.THBAIAI|||||||||||||||||||||\n|CamuBot|||||||||||||||||||||\n\n\n-----\n\n###### USA and Canada\n\nIn the USA, the threat landscape related\nto PC banking Trojans has not changed\nmuch: attacks have been mainly\nconducted using IcedID, Trickbot, and\nDridex and, to a lesser extent, Qbot,\nRamnit, Panda Banker, and Danabot.\nThe situation in Canada has always\nbeen similar to that in the USA, and\nonly the owners of one of the Gozi forks\nhave a particular interest in banking\ncustomers in Canada. IcedID continues\nto use web injections. Unlike many\nother banking Trojans, it employs the\nAutomatic Transfer System (ATS) to steal\nmoney from victims' bank accounts\nautomatically.\n\nIt is worth paying particular attention\nto the Trickbot Trojan. Over the past\nyear, it has been fitted with a new\nmodule for collecting passwords from\ninstalled apps and has been programmed\nto steal configuration files from SYSVOL\ndirectories on domain controllers. It has\nalso started employing Mimikatz and\nhas featured in fileless attacks and active\nmail-outs from compromised computers.\nThese functionalities can be used for\ntargeted attacks on large organizations.\nWe believe that, in the near future, a new\ngroup may emerge that will use Trickbot\nfor targeted attacks on banks rather than\ntheir customers.\n\n###### Europe\n\nEuropean banking customers are still\nbeing targeted by BackSwap, Gootkit,\nDanabot, Osiris, and TinyNuke tools.\nThe simple banking Trojan Retefe poses\na serious threat to northern European\ncountries.\n\nAll these Trojans are well known except\nBackSwap, which is relatively new. Over\nthe past year, the Trojan began attacking\nbanking customers—first Polish, then\nSpanish. In general, Poland is the only\nEuropean country in which attackers\nhave been noticeably more interested.\n\n###### Russia and other post-Soviet countries\n\nIn Russia, the \"homeland\" of most\nbanking Trojans, only one banking Trojan\ncontinues to be actively used: RTM. Its\nvictims are mainly customers of poorly\nprotected banks, however. The banking\nbotnet Toplel has stopped being used\nand no new thefts were detected this\nyear.\n\n\nThe owners of the botnet Buhtrap2\npreviously performed automated\ntransfers through the Russian\n1C accounting system. This scheme led\nto compromise being detected, however,\nwhich prevented criminals from carrying\nout the thefts. In February 2019, the\nhackers tried to revive their botnet, but\nthe financial outcome was unsatisfactory\nand they stopped their activity.\n\n###### APAC\n\nThe most attractive country for attackers\nin this region is Australia, where Gozi,\nTrickbot, Gootkit, Ramnit, and Danabot\nare all used to attack victims. The\nsecond most popular country is Japan,\nwhere the list of active Trojans includes\nGozi, Ramnit, Panda banker, and\nOsiris. Despite the high population and\ndeveloped banking services, attackers\nhave no interest in other countries in the\nregion.\n\n###### Latin America\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Brazil is becoming\nthe main source of new banking Trojans.\nHowever, they are used locally only\nand are most likely developed by local\nhackers. A distinctive feature of these\nTrojans is overlapping windows that\nemulate the operation of banking\napplications.\n\nMnuBot, discovered in the first half\nof 2018, is notable for the fact that its\ncomponent is a remote access Trojan that\nreceives commands from the Microsoft\nSQL database server. A configuration\nfile with a list of targeted banks is also\nreceived from the C&C server.\n\nCamuBot was first used for attack\npurposes in August 2018. Attackers took\nan atypical approach to its distribution.\nInstead of mass campaigns, they called\nvictims purporting to be bank employees\nand tricked them into visiting a phishing\nwebsite to download a “security” module.\nOnce downloaded to the victim's device,\nCamuBot creates a tunnel that allows\nattackers to direct their own traffic\nthrough the infected machine and use\nthe victim’s IP address when accessing\nthe compromised bank account.\nWhen the installation is complete,\na pop-up screen redirects the victim\nto a phishing website disguised as their\nbank’s online banking portal. The victim\nis asked to log into their account and\nunknowingly sends the credentials to the\nattacker.\n\n\nAnother banking Trojan was discovered\nin March 2019, tracked as BANKER.\nTHBAIAI. Below is a description\nof the entire toolset that scammers use\nto conduct attacks involving it.\n\n1. \u0007The first module infects the\ncomputer, then loads and executes\nPowerShell scripts that write .LNK\nfiles to the Startup folder and force\nthe computer to reboot. After the\nreboot, a fake login screen is displayed\nto intercept user credentials.\n\n2. \u0007The second Trojan is launched;\nit attempts to open Microsoft\nOutlook and obtain all the\nemail addresses stored therein.\nIf Outlook is not installed on the\ncomputer, this step is skipped.\n\n3. RADMIN is installed on the system.\n\n4. \u0007The last step is the installation\nof a fileless banking Trojan that targets\ncustomers of the Brazilian banks Banco\nBradesco, Banco do Brasil, and Sicredi.\n\n\nOsiris. Despite the high population and 4. \u0007The last step is the installation\ndeveloped banking services, attackers of a fileless banking Trojan that targets\nhave no interest in other countries in the customers of the Brazilian banks Banco\n\nBradesco, Banco do Brasil, and Sicredi.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Brazil is becoming\nthe main source of new banking Trojans.\nHowever, they are used locally only\nand are most likely developed by local\nhackers. A distinctive feature of these\nTrojans is overlapping windows that\nemulate the operation of banking\n\nMnuBot, discovered in the first half\nof 2018, is notable for the fact that its\ncomponent is a remote access Trojan that\nreceives commands from the Microsoft\nSQL database server. A configuration\nfile with a list of targeted banks is also\nreceived from the C&C server.\n\nCamuBot was first used for attack\npurposes in August 2018. Attackers took\nan atypical approach to its distribution.\nInstead of mass campaigns, they called\nvictims purporting to be bank employees\nand tricked them into visiting a phishing\nwebsite to download a “security” module.\nOnce downloaded to the victim's device,\nCamuBot creates a tunnel that allows\nattackers to direct their own traffic\nthrough the infected machine and use\nthe victim’s IP address when accessing\nthe compromised bank account.\nWhen the installation is complete,\na pop-up screen redirects the victim\nto a phishing website disguised as their\nbank’s online banking portal. The victim\nis asked to log into their account and\nunknowingly sends the credentials to the\n\n\n-----\n\n###### ANDROID TROJANS\n\nUsually, Android banking Trojans steal\nmoney using one of the following\ntechniques:\n\n- \u0007money transfers through\nhijacked SMS messaging;\n\n- rogue mobile banking apps;\n\n- \u0007collection of bank card data, logins and\npasswords by displaying fake windows.\n\nThe first two methods have serious\nlimitations as regards the extent of the\ntheft. Few banks provide SMS money\ntransfer services and the transfer limits\nare very low. The proliferation of fake\nbanking mobile applications requires\nconsiderable investment and effort\nto advertise and promote them. As such,\nthe use of fake windows has been\nthe most effective method. Phishing\nwindows are displayed on top of other\napps and require the user to enter the\nrelevant data.\n\n\nWhen security policies were tightened\nin updated versions of Android and\nfraudulent applications could no longer\ndisplay arbitrary windows, the attack\nscheme stopped being effective. Most\nAndroid Trojan developers were unable\nto adjust their malware to updates, which\nmeant that many effective Android\nTrojans stopped working. Some projects\nwere closed, others were abandoned\nby developers. The development of these\nTrojans slowed noticeably, leading to less\ndamage from their actions.\n\nIn the past, to confirm banking\noperations, banks used text messages.\nWith the widespread introduction\nof mobile applications, banks began\nto switch from text messages to PUSH\nnotifications. Transaction confirmation\ncodes are also delivered through\nPUSH notifications. Compared to text\nmessages, PUSH notifications have\n\n\nseveral key advantages: they are cheaper\nfor banks and safer against Android\nTrojans because all Android-based\nbanking Trojans are able to intercept text\nmessages. This was another reason why\nthe activity of Android banking Trojans\ndecreased.\n\nNevertheless, security measures\nused by banks can be bypassed\nusing the Accessibility Service, which\nis intended for people with disabilities.\nHaving received permission to use the\nAccessibility Service, the malicious\napplication can block other applications'\nwindows, control the device using voice\ncommands, listen to (rather than view)\ncontent, manage PUSH notifications,\ncovertly unlock the device, and perform\narbitrary actions, all the while keeping the\nscreen turned off.\n\n|Old Red Alert, Anubis, Asacub, Loki v2, TarkBot (Rotexy), Flexnet, Riltok|New Gustuff, Cerberus, CometBot, Exobot Compact, BasBanke|Disappeared Agent.sx, Granzy, Agent.BID, LimeBot, Sagawa, Maza-in, Alienbot, Rello, Easy, CryEye, Cannabis, Fmif, AndyBot, Nero banker, Exobot|\n|---|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Gustuff: ATS feature for Android\n\nThe Gustuff Trojan is an improved\nversion of the malware AndyBot,\ndeveloped by the same author. The\napplication’s features include: sending\ninformation about the infected device\nto the server, reading/sending text\nmessages, sending USSD requests,\nsetting up the SOCKS5 proxy, following\nlinks, displaying push notifications,\ntransferring files (including photos)\nto the server, displaying fake web pages,\nand resetting the device to factory\nsettings. The application also uses the\nAccessibility Service to interact with\nelements of windows in other apps\n\n###### New adjusted Trojans without ATS\n\nCerberus was put up for sale in June\n2019. Its features are similar to Gustuff’s.\nIt can also be used to manipulate PUSH\nnotifications from banks. The Cerberus\nTrojan uses enhanced self-defense\ntechniques:\n\n\nand perform actions that are crucial for\nhackers, such as focusing on the object,\nclicking on the object, and changing\nobject text content. For example, at the\nserver’s instruction, the Trojan is able\nto change text field values in banking\napps.\n\nGustuff has a unique feature that has\nnot been seen previously in malicious\nprograms for Android: an ATS\nmechanism, which works according\nto the following algorithm:\n\n- \u0007The Trojan sends a PUSH\nnotification to the user with the\nbanking app’s official icon.\n\n- \u0007Disable Google Play Protect\nand turn it off after a time period\nspecified in the admin panel;\n\n- \u0007Prevent the bot from being deleted,\nadministrator rights from being\ndisabled, and the Accessibility\nService from being turned off.\n\n\n\n- \u0007The user clicks on the\nPUSH notification.\n\n- The associated legitimate app opens.\n\n- The user logs in to the application.\n\n- \u0007On the server’s command, Gustuff\nautomatically fills payment\nfields for illicit transactions.\n\nThe price for leasing the “Gustuff Bot”\nis $800 per month. The author claims\nto take care of their own safety, which\nis why the bot does not operate in Russia,\npost-Soviet countries, or the USA.\n\n- \u0007Evasion of sandbox analysis\nusing accelerometer data.\n\nThe author prohibits the use of the Trojan\nin Russia and other post-Soviet countries.\n\nThe price for leasing the Trojan is $2,000\nper month.\n\n\n-----\n\n**CometBot emerged on hacking forums**\nin February 2019, when a user with the\nnickname “SickHavana” made a post\nabout renting out new malware for\nAndroid.\n\nThis Trojan’s features are much inferior\nto those of the programs described\nabove. However, it works on the latest\nAndroid versions. The offer only included\nready-made web fakes for German banks\nand one Spanish bank, with the possibility\nof a simple expansion to target banks\nin other regions.\n\n**The price for leasing the Trojan**\n**is $850 per month.**\n\n**CometBot**\n\n\nIn March 2019, Exobot Compact, the\nthird version of the infamous malware\nfor Android called Exobot, was put up for\nsale. In May 2018, the source code for\nExobot version 2 was made public. The\nnew version was completely rewritten\nand optimized compared to the one that\nwas publicly available. Exobot Compact\nruns on modern versions of Android\nup to Android 9.\n\nAs was the case with Gustuff, the author\nprohibits attacks in Russia and other\npost-Soviet countries and the USA,\nalthough the program has fake pages for\nU.S. banks.\n\n**The price for leasing the program**\n**is $1,500 per month.**\n\n\n**BasBanke is a new Android Trojan that**\ntargets banking customers in Brazil.\nBasBanke’s functionality is quite basic,\nbut its owners were able to place\nit on Google Play. As a result, it was\ndownloaded more than 10,000 times.\nThis malware can perform tasks such\nas keystroke logging, screen recording,\nand text message interception.\n\n\n**Exobot Compact**\n\n\n-----\n\n|Col1|Poland|Germany|Spain|Australia|Europe|The Netherlands|France|Hong-Kong|Turkey|India|USA|Russia|Ukraine|Italy|United Kingdom|Brazil|Post-Soviet countries|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|RedAlert *||||||||||||||||||\n|CometBot||||||||||||||||||\n|Exobot **||||||||||||||||||\n|Exobot Compact (Exobot 3) **||||||||||||||||||\n|Cerberus ***||||||||||||||||||\n|Loki v2||||||||||||||||||\n|Gustuff (aka AndyBot) ****||||||||||||||||||\n|Anubis||||||||||||||||||\n|Riltok||||||||||||||||||\n|Tarkbot (Rotexy)||||||||||||||||||\n|Flexnet||||||||||||||||||\n|Asacub||||||||||||||||||\n|Agent.BID||||||||||||||||||\n|BasBanke||||||||||||||||||\n\n\n \n**\n\n***\n\n****\n\n\nglobal\n\nmore than 200 targets in various countries\n\nexcept post-Soviet countries and the USA\n\nexcept post-Soviet countries\n\nhe use is prohibited in the post-Soviet countries and the USA\n\n\n-----\n\n### ABOUT GROUP-IB\n\n###### Group−IB is a leading provider of high‑fidelity adversary tracking & threat attribution framework, best‑in‑class anti‑APT and online fraud prevention solutions\n\n 16 years 60 000+ 1 000+ 300+\n\nof hands−on experience hours of incident response cybercrime investigations world−class cybersecurity\n\nexperience worldwide experts\n\n###### OUR CLIENTS\n\n|16 years of hands−on experience|60 000+ hours of incident response experience|1 000+ cybercrime investigations worldwide|300+ world−class c ybersecurity experts|\n|---|---|---|---|\n\n\n###### Our clients include banks, financial institutions,  oil and gas companies, telecoms, IT and cloud  service providers, e-commerce and FMCG  companies, fintech and blockchain startups.
