CISA, the\nFBI, and DOE responded to these campaigns with appropriate action in and around the time that they\noccurred. CISA, the FBI, and DOE are sharing this information in order to highlight historical tactics,\ntechniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by adversaries to target U.S. and international Energy Sector\norganizations.\n\nOn March 24, 2022, the U.S. Department of Justice unsealed indictments of three Russian Federal\nSecurity Service (FSB) officers and a Russian Federation Central Scientific Research Institute of\nChemistry and Mechanics (TsNIIKhM) employee for their involvement in the following intrusion\n[campaigns against U.S. and international oil refineries, nuclear facilities, and energy companies.[1]](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/four-russian-government-employees-charged-two-historical-hacking-campaigns-targeting-critical)\n\n**Global Energy Sector Intrusion Campaign, 2011 to 2018: the FSB conducted a multi-stage**\ncampaign in which they gained remote access to U.S. and international Energy Sector networks,\ndeployed ICS-focused malware, and collected and exfiltrated enterprise and ICS-related data.\n\nOne of the indicted FSB officers was involved in campaign activity that involved deploying\nHavex malware to victim networks.\nThe other two indicted FSB officers were involved in activity targeting U.S. Energy Sector\nnetworks from 2016 through 2018.\n**Compromise of Middle East-based Energy Sector organization with TRITON Malware, 2017:**\nRussian cyber actors with ties to the TsNIIKhM gained access to and leveraged TRITON (also\nknown as HatMan) malware to manipulate a foreign oil refinery’s ICS controllers. TRITON was\ndesigned to specifically target Schneider Electric’s Triconex Tricon safety systems and is capable\nof disrupting those systems. Schneider Electric has issued a patch to mitigate the risk of the\nTRITON malware’s attack vector; however, network defenders should install the patch and remain\nvigilant against these threat actors’ TTPs.\n\nThe indicted TsNIIKhM cyber actor is charged with attempt to access U.S. protected\ncomputer networks and to cause damage to an energy facility.\nThe indicted TsNIIKhM cyber actor was a co-conspirator in the deployment of the TRITON\nmalware in 2017.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis CSA provides the TTPs used by indicted FSB and TsNIIKhM actors in cyber operations against the\nglobal Energy Sector. Specifically, this advisory maps TTPs used in the global Energy Sector campaign\nand the compromise of the Middle East-based Energy Sector organization to the MITRE ATT&CK for\nEnterprise and [ATT&CK for ICS frameworks.](https://collaborate.mitre.org/attackics/index.php/Main_Page)\n\nCISA, the FBI, and DOE assess that state-sponsored Russian cyber operations continue to pose a\nthreat to U.S. Energy Sector networks. CISA, the FBI, and DOE urge the Energy Sector and other\ncritical infrastructure organizations to apply the recommendations listed in the Mitigations section of this\nadvisory and Appendix A to reduce the risk of compromise.\n\nFor more information on Russian state-sponsored malicious cyber activity, see CISA's Russia Cyber\nThreat Overview and Advisories webpage.

See the_ _[ATT&CK for Enterprise and](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/matrices/enterprise/)_ _[ATT&CK for ICS frameworks for all referenced](https://collaborate.mitre.org/attackics/index.php/Main_Page)_\n_threat actor tactics and techniques._\n\n**Global Energy Sector Intrusion Campaign, 2011 to 2018**\n\nFrom at least 2011 through 2018, the FSB (also known as Berserk Bear, Energetic Bear, TeamSpy,\nDragonfly, Havex, Crouching Yeti, and Koala) conducted an intrusion campaign against international\nand U.S. Energy Sector organizations. The threat actor gained remote access to and deployed\nmalware designed to collect ICS-related information on compromised Energy Sector networks, and\nexfiltrated enterprise and ICS data.\n\nBeginning in 2013 and continuing through 2014, the threat actor leveraged Havex malware on Energy\nSector networks. The threat actor gained access to these victim networks via spearphishing emails,\nredirects to compromised websites, and malicious versions of legitimate software updates on multiple\nICS vendor websites. The new software updates contained installations of Havex malware, which\ninfected systems of users who downloaded the compromised updates.\n\n\n-----\n\nHavex is a remote access Trojan (RAT) that communicates with a command and control (C2) server.\nThe C2 server deploys payloads that enumerate all collected network resources and uses the Open\nPlatform Communications (OPC) standard to gather information about connected control systems\ndevices and resources within the network. Havex allowed the actor to install additional malware and\nextract data, including system information, lists of files and installed programs, e-mail address books,\nand virtual private network (VPN) configuration files. The Havex payload can cause common OPC\nplatforms to crash, which could cause a denial-of-service condition on applications that rely on OPC\ncommunications. Note: for additional information on Havex, see to CISA ICS Advisory ICS Focused\nMalware and CISA ICS Alert [ICS Focused Malware (Update A).](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-14-176-02A)\n\nBeginning in 2016, the threat actor began widely targeting U.S. Energy Sector networks. The actor\nconducted these attacks in two stages: first targeting third-party commercial organizations (such as\nvendors, integrators, and suppliers) and then targeting Energy Sector organizations. The threat actor\nused the compromised third-party infrastructure to conduct spearphishing, watering hole, and supply\nchain attacks to harvest Energy Sector credentials and to pivot to Energy Sector enterprise networks.\nAfter obtaining access to the U.S. Energy Sector networks, the actor conducted network discovery,\nmoved laterally, gained persistence, then collected and exfiltrated information pertaining to ICS from the\nenterprise, and possibly operational technology (OT), environments. Exfiltrated information included:\nvendor information, reference documents, ICS architecture, and layout diagrams.\n\nFor more detailed information on FSB targeting of U.S. Energy Sector networks, See CISA Alert\n[Russian Government Cyber Activity Targeting Energy Sector and Other Critical Infrastructure Sectors.](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/TA18-074A)\n\nRefer to Appendix A for TTPs of Havex malware and TTPs used by the actor in the 2016 to 2018\ntargeting of U.S. Energy Sector networks, as well as associated mitigations.\n\n**Compromise of Middle East-based Energy Sector Organization with TRITON Malware, 2017**\n\nIn 2017, Russian cyber actors with ties to TsNIIKhM gained access to and manipulated a foreign oil\nrefinery’s safety devices. TsNIIKhM actors used TRITON malware on the ICS controllers, which\nresulted in the refinery shutting down for several days.\n\nTRITON is a custom-built, sophisticated, multi-stage malware affecting Schneider Electric’s Triconex\nTricon, a safety programmable logic controller (PLC) (also referred to as a safety instrumented system\n\n[SIS]), which monitors industrial processes to prevent hazardous conditions. TRITON is capable of\ndirectly interacting with, remotely controlling, and compromising these safety systems. As these\nsystems are used in a large number of environments, the capacity to disable, inhibit, or modify the\nability of a process to fail safely could result in physical consequences. Note: for additional information\non affected products, see to CISA ICS Advisory [Schneider Electric Triconex Tricon (Update B).](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/advisories/ICSA-18-107-02)\n\nTRITON malware affects Triconex Tricon PLCs by modifying in-memory firmware to add additional\nprogramming. The extra functionality allows an attacker to read/modify memory contents and execute\ncustom code, disabling the safety system.\n\nTRITON malware has multiple components, including a custom Python script, four Python modules,\nand malicious shellcode that contains an injector and a payload. For detailed information on TRITON’s\ncomponents, refer to CISA Malware Analysis Report (MAR): HatMan: Safety System Targeted Malware\n(Update B).\n\n\n-----\n\n**Note: the indicted TsNIIKhM cyber actor was also involved in activity targeting U.S. Energy Sector**\ncompanies in 2018, and other TsNIIKhM-associated actors have targeted a U.S.-based company’s\nfacilities in an attempt to access the company’s OT systems. To date, CISA, FBI, and DOE have no\ninformation to indicate these actors have intentionally disrupted any U.S. Energy Sector infrastructure.\n\nRefer to Appendix A for TTPs used by TRITON as well as associated mitigations.\n\n## Mitigations\n\n**Enterprise Environment**\n\nCISA, the FBI, and DOE recommend Energy Sector and other critical infrastructure organizations\nimplement the following mitigations to harden their corporate enterprise network. These mitigations are\ntailored to combat multiple enterprise techniques observed in these campaigns (refer to Appendix A for\nobserved TTPs and additional mitigations).\n\n**_Privileged Account Management_**\n\nManage the creation of, modification of, use of—and permissions associated with—privileged\naccounts, including `SYSTEM and root.`\n\n**_Password Policies_**\n\nSet and enforce secure password policies for accounts.\n\n**_Disable or Remove Features or Programs_**\n\nRemove or deny access to unnecessary and potentially vulnerable software to prevent abuse by\nadversaries.\n\n**_Audit_**\n\nPerform audits or scans of systems, permissions, insecure software, insecure configurations, etc.,\nto identify potential weaknesses.\n\n**_Operating System Configuration_**\n\nMake configuration changes related to the operating system or a common feature of the operating\nsystem that result in system hardening against techniques.\n\n**_Multifactor Authentication_**\n\nEnforce multifactor authentication (MFA) by requiring users to provide two or more pieces of\ninformation (such as username and password plus a token, e.g., a physical smart card or token\ngenerator) to authenticate to a system.\n\n**_Filter Network Traffic_**\n\nUse network appliances to filter ingress or egress traffic and perform protocol-based filtering.\nConfigure software on endpoints to filter network traffic.\n\n**_Network Segmentation_**\n\nArchitect sections of the network to isolate critical systems, functions, or resources. Use physical\nand logical segmentation to prevent access to potentially sensitive systems and information. Use\na demilitarized zone (DMZ) to contain any internet-facing services that should not be exposed\nfrom the internal network.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Limit Access to Resources over the Network_**\n\nPrevent access to file shares, remote access to systems, and unnecessary services. Mechanisms\nto limit access may include use of network concentrators, Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)\ngateways, etc.\n\n**_Execution Prevention_**\n\nBlock execution of code on a system through application control, and/or script blocking.\n\n**Industrial Control System Environment**\n\nCISA, the FBI, and DOE recommend Energy Sector and other critical infrastructure organizations\nimplement the following mitigations to harden their ICS/OT environment.\n\n**_Network Segmentation_**\n\nImplement and ensure robust network segmentation between IT and ICS networks to limit the\nability of cyber threat actors to move laterally to ICS networks if the IT network is compromised.\n\nImplement a network topology for ICS that has multiple layers, with the most critical\ncommunications occurring in the most secure and reliable layer. For more information refer\nto National Institute of Standard and Technology Special Publication 800-82: Guide to\nIndustrial Control Systems (ICS) Security. Further segmentation should be applied to\nportions of the network that are reliant on one another by functionality. Figure 5 on page 26\nof the [CISA ICS Defense in Depth Strategy document describes this architecture.](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)\nUse one-way communication diodes to prevent external access, whenever possible.\nSet up DMZs to create a physical and logical subnetwork that acts as an intermediary for\nconnected security devices to avoid exposure.\nEmploy reliable network security protocols and services where feasible.\nConsider using virtual local area networks (VLANs) for additional network segmentation, for\nexample, by placing all printers in separate, dedicated VLANs and restricting users’ direct printer\naccess. This same principle can be applied to segmentation of portions of the process for which\ndevices are used. As an example, systems that are only involved in the creation of one\ncomponent within an assembly line that is not directly related to another component can be on\nseparate VLANs, which allows for identification of any unexpected communication, as well as\nsegmentation against potential risk exposure on a larger scale.\nImplement perimeter security between network segments to limit the ability of cyber threat actors\nto move laterally.\n\nControl traffic between network segments by using firewalls, intrusion detection systems\n(IDSs), and rules for filtering traffic on routers and switches.\nImplement network monitoring at key chokepoints—including egress points to the internet,\nbetween network segments, core switch locations—and at key assets or services (e.g.,\nremote access services).\nConfigure an IDS to create alarms for any ICS traffic outside normal operations (after\nestablishing a baseline of normal operations and network traffic).\nConfigure security incident and event monitoring to monitor, analyze, and correlate event\nlogs from across the ICS network to identify intrusion attempts.\n\n**_ICS Best Practices_**\n\nUpdate all software. Use a risk-based assessment strategy to determine which ICS networks,\nassets, and zones should participate in the patch management program.\n\n\n-----\n\nTest all patches in out-of-band testing environments before implementation into production\nenvironments.\nImplement application allow listing on human machine interfaces and engineering workstations.\nHarden software configuration on field devices, including tablets and smartphones.\nReplace all end-of-life software and hardware devices.\nDisable unused ports and services on ICS devices (after testing to ensure this will not affect ICS\noperation).\nRestrict and manage remote access software. Enforce MFA for remote access to ICS networks.\nConfigure encryption and security for network protocols within the ICS environment.\nDo not allow vendors to connect their devices to the ICS network. Use of a compromised device\ncould introduce malware.\nDisallow any devices that do not live solely on the ICS environment from communicating on the\nplatform. ‘Transient devices’ provide risk exposure to the ICS environment from malicious activity\nin the IT or other environments to which they connect.\nMaintain an ICS asset inventory of all hardware, software, and supporting infrastructure\ntechnologies.\nMaintain robust host logging on critical devices within the ICS environment, such as jump boxes,\ndomain controllers, repository servers, etc. These logs should be aggregated into a centralized\nlog server for review.\nEnsure robust physical security is in place to prevent unauthorized personal from accessing\ncontrolled spaces that house ICS equipment.\nRegularly test manual controls so that critical functions can be kept running if ICS/OT networks\nneed to be taken offline.\n\n## Contact Information\n\nAll organizations should report incidents and anomalous activity to CISA 24/7 Operations Center at\n[report@cisa.gov or (888) 282-0870 and/or to the FBI via your local FBI field office or the FBI’s 24/7](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:report@cisa.gov)\n[CyWatch at (855) 292-3937 or CyWatch@fbi.gov.](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:CyWatch@fbi.gov)\n\n## References\n\n[1] https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/four-russian-government-employees-charged-two-historical-hackingcampaigns-targeting-critical\n\n[2] [https://collaborate.mitre.org/attackics/index.php/Software/S0003](https://collaborate.mitre.org/attackics/index.php/Software/S0003%C2%A0)\n\n[3] [https://collaborate.mitre.org/attackics/index.php/Software/S0003](https://collaborate.mitre.org/attackics/index.php/Software/S0003)\n\n[4] [https://collaborate.mitre.org/attackics/index.php/Software/S0013](https://collaborate.mitre.org/attackics/index.php/Software/S0013%C2%A0)\n\n## APPENDIX A: CAMPAIGN AND MALWARE TACTICS, TECHNIQUES, AND PROCEDURES\n\n**Global Energy Sector Campaign: Havex Malware**\n\n[Table 1 maps Havex’s capabilities to the ATT&CK for Enterprise framework, and table 2 maps Havex’s](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/matrices/enterprise/)\n[capabilities to the ATT&CK for ICS framework.
