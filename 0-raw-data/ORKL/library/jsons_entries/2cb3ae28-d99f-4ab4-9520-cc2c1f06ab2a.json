In Q2 2020, we detected\n\n9 percent more attacks than in Q1 2020. Most attacks in the first two quarters\n\nof the year happened in April and May, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n� The percentage of attacks targeting industrial companies has increased signif\nicantly. In attacks on organizations, industrial companies were attacked in 15\n\npercent of cases, compared to 10 percent in Q1. Ransomware operators and\n\ncyberespionage APT groups are among those who seem to be the most inter\nested in industrial companies.\n\n� Among social engineering attacks, 16 percent capitalized on the COVID-19 pan\ndemic. More than a third (36%) of such attacks were not related to any specific\n\nindustry, 32 percent targeted individuals, and 13 percent were aimed at govern\nment institutions.\n\n� In the cybercriminal world, the demand for credentials is growing. Of the total\n\namount of data stolen in attacks against organizations, the share of creden\ntials has doubled in comparison with Q1. The most common credential theft\n\nscenarios include exploitation of web vulnerabilities, phishing emails, malware\n\ninfection, and bruteforcing of credentials for services on the network perimeter\n\nof companies.\n\n� In attacks on organizations, exploitation of software vulnerabilities and config\nuration flaws accounted for 18 percent, compared to 9 percent in Q1. Internet\naccessible corporate network resources are especially attractive to attackers.\n\nCriminals have been actively exploiting vulnerabilities in remote access systems\n\nfrom Palo Alto, Pulse Secure, and Citrix.\n\n� Ransomware trojans were present in 39 percent of malware attacks on organ\nizations. A quarter of ransomware attacks on organizations targeted industrial\n\ncompanies. Attackers continue to threaten disclosure of stolen data if victims\n\nrefuse to pay. LockBit, Ragnar Locker, and Maze operators have joined forces\n\nin a so-called Maze cartel to sell stolen data.\n\n� Besides ransomware operators, other threat actors now blackmail victims with\n\ndisclosure of stolen data and the prospect of fines for violating the General\n\nData Protection Regulation (GDPR).\n\n[To protect from cyberattacks, we recommend following our guidelines for ensuring](https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/analytics/knowledge-base/what-companies-can-do-to-stay-safe/)\n\npersonal and corporate cybersecurity. Whether you continue to work remotely or\n\ngo back to your usual routine, remember that criminals are always on the look\nout for easy prey. They regularly update malicious tactics and techniques so that\n\ntheir actions remain unnoticed in infrastructure for a long time. A web application\n\nfirewall (WAF), proper incident management, deep analysis of network traffic, as\n\nwell as use of sandbox and SIEM solutions can help to detect attacks in time. SIEM\n\ncapabilities provide constant monitoring of infrastructure security incidents, de\ntection of sophisticated attacks on domains, and support for secure remote work.\n\n\n-----\n\n220\n\n200\n\n180\n\n160\n\n140\n\n120\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n\n### Statistics\n\nIn Q2, the number of attacks increased by 9 percent compared to Q1—and by 59 percent com\npared to Q2 2019. Significant world events consistently lead to increases in cybercrime, as they\n\nprovide fertile ground for social engineering attacks. April and May 2020 were record-break\ning in terms of successful cyberattacks. This sharp increase was spurred by epidemiological\n\nand economic crisis.\n\n###### 9% more cyberattacks than in Q1 2020\n\n206\n\n202 © Positive Technologies\n\n194\n\n167\n\n160 159\n\n152\n\n143\n141 141\n\n136\n132 132\n\n113\n\n112 111\n\n104\n\n91\n\n01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12\n\n2019 2020\n\n_Figure 1.

Sarwent enables RDP on compromised hosts and changes Windows\n\nFirewall settings to allow connections. It cannot be ruled out that the attackers will sell or rent\n\nout such access to other cybercriminals. In May we published an article in which we discussed\n\nthe illegal sale of access to corporate networks in more detail.\n\nMalware is refined not only to add new functionality, but to incorporate more sophisticated\n\ntechniques for bypassing protection. For example, specialists from the PT Expert Security\n\n[Center (PT ESC) detected an updated version of Calypso APT malware. The attackers](https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/analytics/calypso-apt-2019/)\n\nchanged the name of export functions in the main library and set an implausible compilation\n\ntime (supposedly in 2021). By doing so, they probably were trying to reduce the odds of be\ning spotted by antivirus software.\n\n_Figure 9. Implausible compilation time of Calypso malware_\n\nIn Q2 2020, PT ESC detected 13 attacks by the Gamaredon APT group. The group keeps\n\n[attacking Ukrainian government institutions.

Data stolen_\n\n### COVID-19 as a social engineering ruse\n\nIn Q2, attackers have been actively exploiting COVID-19 concerns. COVID-19 was leveraged\n\nin 16 percent of social engineering attacks. More than a third (36%) of such attacks were not\n\nrelated to any specific industry, while 32 percent of attacks targeted individuals. Government\n\ninstitutions were targeted in 13 percent of COVID-19 social engineering attacks. PT ESC\n\ndetected attacks involving Chinoxy malware against companies in Kyrgyzstan and Vietnam.\n\n\n-----\n\n[The attackers used the Royal Road exploit builder to create a document exploiting vulnerability](https://nao-sec.org/2020/01/an-overhead-view-of-the-royal-road.html)\n\n[CVE-2018-0798 in Equation Editor.

They\n\n[also created fake pandemic-related websites hosting malware disguised as useful information,](https://www.hackread.com/hackers-setup-fake-nhs-website-spread-malware/)\n\n[performed business email compromise attacks to steal money, and distributed malicious ap-](https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/fbi-anticipates-rise-in-business-email-compromise-schemes-related-to-the-covid-19-pandemic)\n\nplications. For example, attackers distributed the SLocker Android trojan disguised as an app\n\n[called Koronavirus haqida, which means \"About Coronavirus\" in Uzbek. The trojan locked the](https://labs.bitdefender.com/2020/05/android-slocker-variant-uses-coronavirus-scare-to-take-android-hostage/)\n\nscreen of the victim's phone, prompting to pay to regain control of the device. Another exam\n[ple is CryCryptor Android ransomware, which masqueraded as Covid-19 Tracer App to attack](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/06/24/new-ransomware-uses-covid19-tracing-guise-target-canada-eset-decryptor/)\n\nusers in Canada. In most cases, such mobile trojans are distributed via websites, which is why\n\nwe do not recommend installing applications from unofficial sources.\n\n### On the hunt for credentials\n\nThirty percent of all data stolen in attacks on organizations were credentials, an increase from\n\n15 percent in Q1. Corporate credentials are the most valuable kind of information for attack\ners. Criminals sell them on the darkweb or use them for further attacks, such as imitating the\n\nhacked company to send emails with malicious attachments. Databases with credentials of\n\nhacked companies' clients are also in high demand.\n\n15% 14%\n\n29%\n\nOnline services Science and education\n\n\n11%\n\n3%\n\n\nRetail\n\nHospitality and entertainment\n\nIT\n\nManufacturing and industry\n\n© Positive Technologies\n\n\nHealthcare\n\nFinance\n\nOther\n\nMultiple industries\n\n\n3% 5% 5% 7% 8%\n\n_Figure 19. Categories of victims of credential compromise (in attacks on organizations)_\n\n_Figure 20. Advertisement for corporate credentials on the darkweb_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 21. Advertisement for SSH access to a SIP telephony operator_\n\nHere we will review the most common scenarios of credential compromise attacks performed\n\nin Q2 2020.\n\n**1.** **Hacking of web resources and theft of credential databases.** In Q2, attackers primarily\n\ntargeted online services, e-shops, and service sector companies. In most cases, they ex\nploited web vulnerabilities or bruteforced passwords to access websites. For example, the\n\nShiny Hunters group posted an advertisement on the darkweb offering the databases of\n\n[dozens of companies. Among the victims were e-learning platform Unacademy, The Daily](https://www.hackread.com/tokopedia-hacked-login-details-sold-on-dark-web/)\n\nChronicle news website, the Knock CRM platform, and many others. A single database gen\n[erally costs between $1,000 and $2,000. However, the database of online store Tokopedia,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hacker-sells-91-million-tokopedia-accounts-cracked-passwords-shared/)\n\ncontaining information for 91 million accounts, was offered on a darkweb market for $5,000.\n\n**2.** **Phishing emails with links to fake authentication forms. Most often, attackers forge the**\n\nauthentication forms of Microsoft products, such as Office 365, Outlook, and SharePoint.\n\nHowever, at the peak of the pandemic in Q2, they also tried to steal credentials for audio and\n\n[videoconferencing platforms. In one such case, attackers deployed a phishing campaign](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/creative-skype-phishing-campaign-uses-googles-app-gtld/)\n\nagainst remote employees using Skype, sending them emails with fake Skype notifications.\n\nBy clicking a link in a phishing email, the victims landed on a fraudulent login page and were\n\n[asked to provide their credentials. Similar attacks hit users of Webex and Zoom.](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/remote-video-conferencing-themes-credential-theft-and-malware-threats)\n\n**3.** **Infection with credential-stealing malware. In most cases, it suffices for employees to**\n\nmerely open a malicious phishing attachment to get their company infected with malware.\n\nLately, in the footsteps of cybergroups, ransomware operators have also started hunting for\n\n[credentials. In Q2, Zaha Hadid Architects became a victim of Light ransomware. The crimi-](https://www.zdnet.com/article/hackers-threaten-to-leak-data-from-high-end-architecture-firm-zaha-hadid/)\n\nnals stole a large number of internal files and compromised employees' accounts.\n\n_[Figure 22. Fake Outlook login form used in a phishing attack against Turkish military vehicle manufacturer Otokar](https://twitter.com/issuemakerslab/status/1260888237683302400)_\n\n\n-----\n\n**4.** **Bruteforcing of credentials to services on the network perimeter. In the first two quarters**\n\nof 2020, such attacks have become especially relevant due to the global workforce’s shift\n\nto remote work, which made some services accessible from the Internet for the first time. In\n\n[April, cybersecurity specialists observed an increasing number of attacks across the globe](https://www.zdnet.com/article/kaspersky-rdp-brute-force-attacks-have-gone-up-since-start-of-covid-19/)\n\naimed at bruteforcing RDP credentials. In order not to fall victim to such attacks, it is vital\n\nto use strong passwords and multi-factor authentication, as well as enable RDP connec\ntions only over corporate VPNs. If you do not use RDP, we recommend closing port 3389.\n\nSpecially configured SIEM correlation rules help to detect bruteforce attacks on corporate\n\nremote access systems in time.\n\n_[Figure 23. Credential compromise incident (MaxPatrol SIEM interface)](https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/products/mpsiem/)_\n\n### Network perimeter resources  under attack\n\nIn Q2 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic and shift to remote work have led to an increase in\n\nattacks on vulnerabilities in web-accessible corporate services. As a result, the share of\n\nattacks exploiting software vulnerabilities and configuration flaws has increased to 18\n\npercent in Q2 (compared to 9% in Q1). Criminals pursued various goals, from installation of\n\nminers to cyberespionage on large companies' networks.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### In Q2 2020, hackers targeted the following vulnerabilities:\n\n� _CVE-2020-11651 and CVE-2020-11652 (SaltStack Framework)_\n\n� _CVE-2019-19781 (Citrix ADC, Gateway)_\n\n� _CVE-2019-11510 (Pulse Secure VPN)_\n\n� _CVE-2019-18935 (Progress Telerik UI)_\n\n� _CVE-2019-0604 (Microsoft SharePoint)_\n\n� _CVE-2020-0688 (Microsoft Exchange)_\n\nAttackers were especially hungry for remote access systems.

The second flaw](https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asaftd-path-JE3azWw43)\n\n[(CVE-2020-3259) allows an intruder to intercept a VPN user's session identifier and access](https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asaftd-info-disclose-9eJtycMB)\n\na company's internal network. To eliminate the vulnerabilities, update Cisco ASA to the most\n\nrecent version.\n\nSigns of compromise of remote access systems include multiple failed VPN connection at\ntempts, attempts to connect to hosts of critical subsystems from the VPN, enabled RDP ac\ncess on the firewall, and concurrent connections (parallel sessions). To detect such incidents,\n\nuse SIEM systems with fine-tuned security incident correlation rules.\n\n\n-----\n\n_[Figure 24. MaxPatrol SIEM detects connections to critical resources from VPN](https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/products/mpsiem/)_\n\nOnce information about a severe vulnerability is published, criminals immediately try to exploit\n\n[it. Only a few days after announcement of vulnerability CVE-2020-5902, uncovered by our](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-5902)\n\ncompany's expert in the F5 Networks BIG-IP application delivery controller, hackers tried to\n\n[exploit it. The vulnerability has the highest CVSS score. Note that APT groups may also be](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cve-2020-5902-helping-to-protect-against-the-f5-tmui-rce-vulnerability/)\n\ninterested in exploiting this flaw, meaning that companies that have not yet installed the vendor\n\nupdates are at risk. To block attacks aimed at exploiting these vulnerabilities, we recommend\n\nusing a web application firewall (WAF).\n\n### Ransomware collaboration\n\nRansomware is one of the fastest-growing varieties of cybercrime. It has become a common\n\npractice for attackers to threaten to disclose the stolen data unless the victim pays a ransom.\n\nMaze and Sodinokibi operators were the most active perpetrators of such attacks in Q2 2020.\n\nDoppelPaymer, NetWalker, Ako, Nefilim, and Clop are also among the leaders by number of\n\n[cyberextortion attacks. Some of them, like Ako, even implement a \"double extortion\" scheme](https://www.databreaches.net/ako-ransomware-operators-put-some-hurt-on-pain-management-doctors/)\n\nby demanding separate ransoms for decryption and non-disclosure of data.\n\n[To sell the stolen data, many ransomware operators create special data leak sites where they](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/list-of-ransomware-that-leaks-victims-stolen-files-if-not-paid/)\n\npublish a list of victims and the stolen information. Others publish the data on hacker forums.\n\nLockBit and Ragnar Locker went even further, teaming up with the \"industry leader\" hacking\n\ngroup Maze. The Maze operators now publish data stolen by other gangs on their data leak site.\n\n[Together, the gangs have formed the so-called Maze cartel.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-gangs-team-up-to-form-extortion-cartel/)\n\n[However, this is not the only possible collaboration scheme. Ransomware attackers often buy](https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/analytics/access-for-sale-2020/)\n\n[access to victim companies' networks from other criminals. The operators of NetWalker are](https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/analytics/access-for-sale-2020/)\n\n[recruiting affiliates to spread their ransomware by offering a commission on the ransom.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-recruits-affiliates-with-huge-payouts-automated-leaks/)\n\n\n-----\n\n24%\n\n3%\n\n3%\n4%\n\n\n10% 25%\n\n14% 17%\n\n\nManufacturing and industry\n\nHealthcare\n\nGovernment\n\nIT\n\n© Positive Technologies\n\n\nFinance\n\nRetail\n\nOther\n\nMultiple industries\n\n\n_Figure 25. Ransomware victim categories among organizations_\n\nDespite the need to share the proceeds, ransomware owners are still profiting handsomely. In\n\n[Q2 alone, they reaped millions of U.S. dollars. The University of California San Francisco paid](https://healthitsecurity.com/news/ucsf-pays-1.14m-to-netwalker-hackers-after-ransomware-attack)\n\n[$1.14 million in ransom after an attack by NetWalker ransomware.

The ransom, set at $21 million, was not paid. The hackers\n\n[then doubled the ransom and started to offer the data of A-list stars for sale. Criminals claim](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/revil-ransomware-found-buyer-for-trump-data-now-targeting-madonna/)\n\nto have a buyer ready for information about Donald Trump. In May, Sodinokibi held an online\n\nauction of the stolen data, the first lot being documents relating to Madonna.\n\n_Figure 26. Auction announcement on the Sodinokibi website_\n\n### Ransomware owners are not the only ones to demand ransom\n\nOther criminals have quickly caught up with the trend of demanding ransom for non-disclo\n[sure. For example, hackers are demanding a ransom from stores in order to not sell the stolen](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hacker-extorts-online-shops-sells-databases-if-ransom-not-paid/)\n\ndata to third parties. The $500 ransom they are asking is relatively modest compared to what\n\nthe Sodinokibi operators are trying to extort. Nevertheless, this business model can offer sig\nnificant profits: database owners are often willing to pay to protect their reputation, while the\n\ncriminals never run out of potential buyers.\n\n\n-----\n\nAbout Positive\nTechnologies\n\n\n[Another cybergroup is breaking into LenovoEMC network-attached storage devices, deleting](https://www.zdnet.com/article/a-hacker-gang-is-wiping-lenovo-nas-devices-and-asking-for-ransoms/)\n\nfiles, and demanding ransom of $200 to $275 to restore the data. Similar campaigns hit poorly\n\n[protected MongoDB databases in Q2. Attackers wipe the compromised databases and then,](https://www.zdnet.com/article/hacker-ransoms-23k-mongodb-databases-and-threatens-to-contact-gdpr-authorities/)\n\njust like ransomware operators, frighten victims with the potential of GDPR penalties unless a\n\nransom of $140 is paid. Note that even unskilled hackers can perform such attacks by using\n\nready-made scripts that allow them to search the Internet for devices with weak passwords or\n\nwithout password protection. It is therefore vital to ensure secure configuration of your sys\ntems and use strong passwords and two-factor authentication for critical resources\n\n### About the research\n\nIn this quarter's report, Positive Technologies shares information on the most important and\n\nemerging IT security threats. Information is drawn from our own expertise, outcomes of nu\nmerous investigations, and data from authoritative sources.\n\nIn our view, the majority of cyberattacks are not made public due to reputational risks. The re\nsult is that even organizations that investigate incidents and analyze activity by hacker groups\n\nare unable to perform a precise count. This research is conducted in order to draw the atten\ntion of companies and ordinary individuals who care about the state of information security\n\nto the key motives and methods of cyberattacks, as well as to highlight the main trends in the\n\nchanging cyberthreat landscape.\n\nIn this report, each mass attack (in which attackers send out a phishing email to many address\nes, for instance) is counted as a single incident. The terminology used in this report can be\n\n[found in our glossary.](https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/analytics/glossary/en/a/)\n\nFor 18 years, Positive Technologies has been creating innovative solutions for information security.
