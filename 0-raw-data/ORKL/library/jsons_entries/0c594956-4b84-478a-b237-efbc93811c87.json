Criminals steal\ncard data during online shopping. Who are behind these notorious hacks, how does it\nwork, and how have Magecart attacks evolved over time?\n\n[About Magecart](https://sansec.io/what-is-magecart)\n\nphoto by Oktarina Paramitha Sandy\n\nThe Indonesian police announced on Friday that they have arrested three alleged Magecart\nhackers on December 20th. The suspects are from Jakarta and Yogyakarta and are 23, 26\nand 35 years old. After the press conference, one suspect admitted on Indonesian\n\n\n-----\n\n[television that he had injected web skimmers into ecommerce stores since 2017 and only](https://www.metrotvnews.com/play/NleC6Ale-eksklusif-pengakuan-hacker-pembobol-situs-e-commerce)\nmade enough money to “buy a jacket”. The suspects face up to 10 years in prison under\narticle 363 of the Indonesian Criminal Code.\n\nThe Indonesian police reported that this group had intercepted payments for 12 (mostly\nEuropean) stores. The arrests carried out by Indonesian police were part of a coordinated\nInterpol anti-skimming campaign called Operation Night Fury with support from European\nand US cyberteams.\n\n[Joint press conference by Indonesian National Police & #INTERPOL on Operation](https://twitter.com/hashtag/INTERPOL?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\nNight Fury led by INTERPOL’s [#ASEAN Desk, sharing the successful arrest of 3](https://twitter.com/hashtag/ASEAN?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\nsuspects involved in JS-sniffer campaign compromising e-commerce websites to\n[steal credit card or online payment information pic.twitter.com/2C12fvZ92X](https://t.co/2C12fvZ92X)\n\n[— INTERPOL_Cyber (@INTERPOL_Cyber) January 24, 2020](https://twitter.com/INTERPOL_Cyber/status/1220678144404770817?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n## 571 stores hacked, suspects still at large\n\nSansec has been tracking the activity of this group for several years and has identified not\n12 but 571 hacks by the same individuals. These hacks could be attributed because of an\nodd message that was left in all of the skimming code:\n\n“Success gan !” translates to “Success bro” in Indonesian and has been present for years\non all of their skimming infrastructure.\n\nThe hackers registered a range of domain names for their skimming operations, some of\nthem clearly referring to their whereabouts or intentions. Here is a small sample:\n```\ntrustme.web.id\nbikin.id\nnganuenak.com (\"delicious\")\nbakulsemprul.com (a cafetaria on Kalimantan)\nadventurewar.com\nride4speed.com\nmagecart.net\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nFurthermore, we have observed similar hacks since the arrest at December 20th. The\nIndonesian police confirms that suspects from the same group are still at large, but would\nnot disclose further details. As of today, we found 27 stores that are still being skimmed\nusing the same code. Several exfiltration servers are still actively collecting intercepted\npayments, notably the brazen `magecart.net domain.`\n\n## End of Magecart?\n\nThis group had a serious impact on global ecommerce security in recent years, by\nskimming at least 571 hacked stores. However, they were responsible for just 1% of all\nMagecart incidents since 2017. Sansec estimates that there are yet another 40 to 50 more\nsophisticated individuals involved in web-skimming activity.\n\n## About us\n\nSansec was the first to publish about web skimming and has been tracking global skimming\nactivity since 2015. Our anti-skimming technology and fraud data are used by merchants,\nforensic investigators, financial anti-fraud teams and service providers.\n\n[Get in touch!](https://sansec.io/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#e1888f878ea192808f928482cf888e)\n\n[data-size=\"large\" > Follow @sansecio](https://twitter.com/sansecio)\n\n\n-----",
