However, the prizes never materialized, and the scheme generated a\nsprawling spam campaign that fed new traffic to the scam sites.\n\n\n-----\n\nImage: Group-IB (supplied)\nGroup-IB said the scheme targeted millions of users worldwide.\n\nThe company told The Record that after notifying the UN’s International Computing Centre,\nthey worked with “a wide network of regulators and service suppliers – domain name\nregistrars, hosting providers, associations, including FIRST, TRUSTED Introducer, APWG,\nScamadviser and many others” to take down the 134 sites.\n\nGroup-IB said the 134 scam sites were managed by a known threat actor going by the name\nof DarkPath.\n\n“After our blocking efforts, the scammers stopped using the WHO branding across their\nentire network,” a Group-IB spokesperson told The Record today.\n\nStill, despite the WHO-centered takedown, the group is still active. Group-IB says the threat\nactor still operates around 500 other sites impersonating other brands.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe security firm estimates the reach of these sites in the millions, with around 200,000\nusers landing on the scam sites each day.\n\nImage: Group-IB (supplied)\n\n\n-----\n\nImage: Group-IB (supplied)\nTags\n\n[Group-IB](https://therecord.media/tag/group-ib/)\n[scam](https://therecord.media/tag/scam/)\n[takedown](https://therecord.media/tag/takedown/)\n[UN](https://therecord.media/tag/un/)\n[United Nations](https://therecord.media/tag/united-nations/)\n[WHO](https://therecord.media/tag/who/)\n\nCatalin Cimpanu is a cybersecurity reporter for The Record.
