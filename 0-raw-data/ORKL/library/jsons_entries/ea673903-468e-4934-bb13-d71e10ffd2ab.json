Their choice is quite logical — they’re seeking direct\naccess to finances. The most recent manifestation of this trend is a spike in Trojan activity:\nspecifically, from Buhtrap and RTM. They have different functions and ways of spreading, but\nthe same purpose — to steal money from the accounts of businesses.\n\n\n-----\n\nBoth threats are particularly relevant to companies that work in IT, legal services, and smallscale production. Perhaps this can be explained by such companies’ much smaller security\nbudgets in comparison with companies working in the financial sector.\n\n## RTM\n\nUsually, RTM infects victims by using phishing mail. The letters mimic common business\ncorrespondence (including phrases such as “return request,” “copies of last month’s\ndocuments,” or “request for payment”). Clicking a link or opening an attachment leads to\nimmediate infection, giving operators full access to the infected system.\n\nIn 2017, our systems registered 2,376 users attacked by RTM. In 2018, we saw 130,000\ntargets. And with less than two months having elapsed so far in 2019, we’ve already seen\nmore than 30,000 users who encountered this Trojan. If the trend continues, it will top last\nyear’s record. For now, we can call RTM one of the most active financial Trojans.\n\nThe majority of RTM’s targets operate in Russia. However, our experts expect it to cross\nborders and eventually attack users in other countries.\n\n### Buhtrap\n\nThe first encounter with Buhtrap was registered back in 2014. At that time it was the name of\na cybercriminal group that was stealing money from Russian financial establishments — to\nthe tune of at least $150,000 per hit. After the source codes of their tools became public in\n2016, the name Buhtrap was used for the financial Trojan.\n\nBuhtrap resurfaced in the beginning of 2017 in the TwoBee campaign, where it served\nprimarily as means of malware delivery. In March of last year, it hit the news (literally),\nspreading through several compromised major news outlets in whose main pages malicious\nactors implanted scripts. This scripts executed an exploit for Internet Explorer in visitor’s\nbrowsers.\n\nA couple of months later, in July, cybercriminals narrowed down their audience and\nconcentrated on a particular user group: accountants working at small and medium-size\nbusinesses. For that reason, they created websites with information particularly for\naccountants.\n\nWe recall this malware because of the new spike, which began in late 2018 and is continuing\nto this day. In total, our protection systems prevented more than 5,000 Buhtrap attack\nattempts, 250 of them since the beginning of 2019.\n\nJust like last time, Buhtrap is spreading through exploits embedded in news outlets. As\nusual, Internet Explorer users are in the group at risk. IE uses an encrypted protocol to\ndownload malware from infected sites, and that complicates analysis and allows the malware\n\n\n-----\n\nto avoid notice by some security solutions. And yes, it still uses a vulnerability that was\ndisclosed back in 2018.\n\nAs a result of infection, both Buhtrap and RTM provide full access to compromised\nworkstations. This allows cybercriminals to change the files used for data exchange between\naccounting and banking systems. Those files have default names and no additional\nprotective measures, so attackers can change them at will. Estimating the damages is\nchallenging, but as we learned, the criminals are siphoning off assets in transactions that do\nnot exceed $15,000 each.\n\n### What can be done?\n\nTo protect your business from such threats, we recommend paying exceptional attention to\nthe protection of computers — such as those of accountants and management — that have\naccess to financial systems. Of course, all other machines need protection as well. Here are\nsome more practical tips:\n\nInstall security patches and updates for all software as soon as possible.\nForbid, to the extent possible, use of remote administration utilities on accountants’\ncomputers.\nProhibit the installation of any unapproved programs.\nImprove the general security awareness of employees who work with finances, but also\nfocus on antiphishing practices.\nInstall a protective solution with active behavioral analysis technologies such as\n[Kaspersky Endpoint Security for Business.](https://www.kaspersky.com/small-to-medium-business-security?icid=gl_kdailyplacehold_acq_ona_smm__onl_b2b_kasperskydaily_wpplaceholder_______)\n\n[finance](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/tag/finance/)\n[phishing](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/tag/phishing/)\n[trojans](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/tag/trojans/)\n\nShare article\n\nRelated\n\n\n-----",
