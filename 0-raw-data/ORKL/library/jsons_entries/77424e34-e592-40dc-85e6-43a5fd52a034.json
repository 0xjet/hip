In the\nmost recent string of attacks, Dragon\ry has targeted multiple US and European energy\ncompanies, successfully looting valuable process information in what appears to be the next\nstep in the cyberwarfare campaign against critical infrastructure organizations, after Stuxnet\nin 2010. Cybersecurity vendors have scrutinized the campaign and presented an analysis of the\nmalware employed by Dragon\ry to steal information from the infected computers. This short\npaper revisits the main points of this investigation and illustrates why the implementation of\na defense-in-depth strategy is key to successfully counter cyberthreats like Dragon\ry.\n\n\n-----\n\n# The Dragon\ry cyberespionage campaign\n\nThe Dragon\ry hacker group has successfully mounted a cyberespionage operation against\nUS and European companies, mainly in the energy sector. The group managed to install a\nremote access tool (RAT) in computers used for running Industrial Control Systems (ICS),\nand to harvest data from the infected machines utilizing a payload designed for a speci\fc\nindustrial protocol. According to Symantec [1], the Dragon\ry campaign appears to have\na much broader focus than the preceding Stuxnet campaign: \\While Stuxnet was narrowly\ntargeted at the Iranian nuclear program and had sabotage as its primary goal, Dragon\ry\nappears to have a much broader focus with espionage and persistent access as its current\nobjective with sabotage as an optional capability if required.\" There has been no proof that\nany sabotage capabilities were used by the Dragon\ry group to date, but capabilities may exist\nin the toolkits employed, representing possibly the scariest part of the story, as they could\npotentially open doors to dramatic scenarios. Was the stealing of industrial information from\nenergy companies only the \frst step of a destructive cyberwarfare campaign?\n\n### The attacker\n\nThe Dragon\ry hacker group (also known as Energetic Bear) appears to be in operation since\n2011. It initially targeted organizations in the defense and aviation industries in US and\nCanada, before moving their attention to US and Western European energy \frms in 2013.\nAn analysis of the malware code used in the campaign has shown that the group worked mostly\nduring Eastern European working hours (Monday through Friday from 9AM to 6PM, UTC+4\ntime zone), suggesting that most group members worked in that region. The complexity of\nthe operation leads many to believe that Dragon\ry is a well-funded, possibly state-sponsored\ngroup of adversaries.\n\n\n-----\n\n### The targets\n\nSo far, the campaign has resulted in the leakage of information from multiple organizations,\nmany of which operate in the energy sector, and range from electricity generation companies, electricity grid and petroleum pipeline operators, and industrial system and equipment\nproviders. The majority of the victims are located in Europe, followed by the US. Figure 1\nshows the top 10 countries by active infections (i.e. where the attacker has extracted information from infected computers).\n\nFigure 1: Top 10 countries by active infections [1]\n\nIn total, the number of infected machines that attempted to report to a malware command\nand control (C&C) server is approximately 1500 [2]. These numbers represent hosts that have\nbeen compromised and have established C&C communications, which does not necessarily\nrepresent the number of actual industrial control system hosts compromised (this will be\ndiscussed in more detail later in this paper). Precise information about the extent of the ICS\ncompromise is not available at the time of writing, but is expected to be signi\fcantly less\nthan shown in the reported chart.\n\n### Attack vectors\n\nDragon\ry used two pieces of malware in the attack; both were remote access tools (RATs)\ndesigned to carry out the cyberespionage operations. The RATs were distributed and reached\nthe victims' machines through three attack vectors:\n\n� E-mail campaign: selected executives and senior employees of targeted companies\nwould receive e-mails with a malicious PDF attachment containing the RAT. Symantec\nidenti\fed seven di\u000berent organizations targeted in this campaign; the number of emails\nsent to each organization ranged from 1 to 84 [1].\n\n� Watering hole attacks: these attacks targeted a number of legitimate websites likely\nto be visited by individuals working in the energy sector. Upon visiting one of the\ninfected websites, the visitor would be redirected to another compromised legitimate\nwebsite hosting an exploit kit. This exploit kit would in turn install the RAT on the\nvisitor's computer.\n\n� Software downloaded from ICS related vendors: Dragon\ry members managed to\nhack the websites of at least three di\u000berent ICS related vendors, and insert malware\n\n\n-----\n\ninto the legitimate software they were making available for download to their clients.\nThe malware would then be installed on the victim's computer upon download of the\ntrusted software or update. The targeted vendors are based in Germany, Switzerland,\nand Belgium. The \frst identi\fed software package to be Trojanized was used to provide\nVPN access to programmable logic controller (PLC) and similar devices. The second\ncompany manufactures a PLC type device, and had one of their communication drivers\nTrojanized. The third company included in this campaign develops ICS systems for\nprimarily renewable energy markets.\n\nDragon\ry employed these attack vectors in three successive phases of the campaign. The\ne-mail attacks were conducted between February and June 2013; they were followed by the\nwatering hole attacks beginning in June 2013 that included the compromise of ICS vendor\nwebsites. The \frst ICS vendor website was compromised for a period of six weeks during the\nperiod of June-July 2013, followed by the second vendor in January 2014. This second vendor\nwas able to identify the breach, notify a\u000bected users and mitigate the situation in about 10\ndays. It is estimated that around 250 downloads of the infected software occurred during this\nphase [3]. The \fnal ICS vendor website breach occurred in April 2014 and lasted two weeks.\n\n### Malware operation\n\nThe attackers employed two RATs to steal information from the infected computers and\nsend it to C&C servers under the control of the attackers. Both of these RATs provided the\ncapability of downloading and executing \fles remotely via the C&C servers:\n\n� The Havex RAT (also known as Backdoor.Oldrea): it allows the attacker to extract\ndata from the Outlook address book and ICS related software con\fguration \fles used\nfor remote access from the infected computer to other industrial systems. Furthermore,\nit gathers system information on the installed programs, local \fle lists, and available\ndrives.\n\n� Karagany (Trojan.Karagany): it allows the attackers to upload and download \fles\nfrom the infected computer and to run executable \fles. It also contains advanced\nfeatures for collecting passwords, taking screenshots, and cataloguing documents stored\non the victim's machine. Karagany was already available on the underground market,\nalthough the Dragon\ry group might have modi\fed the source code to best \fts its\npurposes.\n\nMost of the victims were infected with the Havex RAT; Karagany was identi\fed on only\n5% of the infected computers. Havex appears to be custom malware either written by the\nDragon\ry group itself or commissioned by them. Security analysts of F-Secure [2] have identi\fed and analyzed 88 variants of Havex, which contacted 146 C&C servers to communicate\nthe stolen information. The majority of the C&C servers host blogs and content management systems (primarily WordPress[1]), presumably compromised by the attackers using similar\nexploits. These numbers strengthen the belief that the operation is state-sponsored.\nFrom an operational viewpoint, certain payloads deployed with the Havex RAT exhibit\n\\ICS network sni\u000eng\" behavior. In particular, they attempt to enumerate and qualify the\ndevices in the local area network, and send the results back to the C&C servers. An analysis of\nthe malware executables highlights that the attackers were looking for OPC (Open Platform\nCommunications[2]) servers. OPC is a real-time data exchange protocol that supports bidirectional reading/writing of process variables, but does not provide more advanced capabilities\n\n[1http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=qCdMwtZ6](http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=qCdMwtZ6)\n2OPC was renamed from \\Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) for Process Control\" to \\Open Platform\nCommunications\" in November 2011.\n\n\n-----\n\nlike device con\fguration and \frmware updates. OPC is a standard way for process control\nsystems, applications and devices to interact with each other.\nIt is important to note that not all variants of the Havex RAT and its associated payloads\ncontained the code used to enumerate OPC services on a network. The observed payloads\ncontaining the ICS (OPC) components are believed to have originated only via the Trojanized\nsoftware downloads from the three mentioned ICS vendor websites. This conclusion is based\non analysis of malware referenced by F-Secure [2] and obtained through VirusTotal[3]. This\nmeans that the actual number of compromised ICS systems is likely much less than the\nidenti\fed number of hosts/sites infected by the Havex malware along.\nFigures 2 and 3 shows the relevant extract of the Havex payload containing the network\nand OPC enumeration code. Looking at the malware code, we can indeed see that it uses\nMicrosoft Component Object Model (COM) interfaces to detect whether the machines identi\fed during the network scan run OPC services. The two COM interfaces found in the code\nare the following:\n\n� IOPCServerList (CLSID = 13486D51-4821-11D2-A494-3CB306C10000)\n\n� IOPCServerList2 (IID = 9DD0B56C-AD9E-43EE-8305-487F3188BF7A)\n\nFigure 2: Extract from Havex Executable (taken from samples obtained from VirusTotal)\n\nFigure 3: Extract from Havex Strings (taken from samples obtained from VirusTotal)\n\nThe fact that Dragon\ry is gathering information about OPC servers and VPN connections\nto PLCs might indicate that the \fnal objective is to gain access to the PLCs themselves,\nwhich would enable the attackers to change, damage or disrupt the critical processes run by\nthe targeted organizations.\n\n[3https://www.virustotal.com/](https://www.virustotal.com/)\n\n\n-----\n\n# SilentDefense detects the malware used by Dragon\ry\n\nSecurityMatters' \ragship product SilentDefense ICS is capable of detecting Havex in multiple\nstages of its operation, immediately alerting the security team of the threat and enabling\nthe targeted victim to mitigate it before damage is done or sensitive information is disclosed.\nIn particular, SilentDefense ICS detects Havex both when it attempts to connect to the\nC&C server to download or upload \fles and information, and when it scans the network to\nenumerate devices. In the next paragraphs we illustrate how SilentDefense ICS would detect\nand alert about the Havex behavior.\n\n### The network Behavioral Blueprint\n\nSilentDefense ICS is a network monitoring and intrusion detection system that automatically\nmodels normal and acceptable network behavior and alerts whenever some network devices\nperform activities that diverge from their intended operation. SilentDefense ICS operates in\ntwo phases. First, it analyzes network communications and generates the network Behavioral\nBlueprint[TM]. The Behavioral Blueprint de\fnes communication patterns, protocols, message\ntypes, message \felds, and \feld values that are normal for the monitored process. A review\nof the Behavioral Blueprint immediately reveals network and system miscon\fguration (e.g.,\nrogue devices), unintended communications, and unusual \feld values employed in the network,\nin case Havex already infected some devices. After this setup phase, SilentDefense ICS can\nbe used for continuous monitoring to detect whenever network devices perform unintended\nactivities. In the case of Havex, these unintended activities are represented by the network\nscan and the communication with the C&C servers.\nFigures 4 and 5 show some examples of network Behavioral Blueprints as displayed by\nSilentDefense ICS. The examples represent the two \\types\" of Behavioral Blueprint that\nSilentDefense ICS can generate. In particular, Figure 4 shows the model of normal network\ncommunications automatically generated by SilentDefense ICS' LAN Communication Pro\fle\n(LAN CP) engine. The LAN CP reports the observed network communications in terms of\n\n\n-----\n\ncommunication patterns, protocols, and protocol message types normally used by the devices\nin the network. Note that this includes details of which device has communicated using which\n(D)COM interfaces. The controls implemented by the LAN CP make sure that whenever a\nnetwork device connects to an unusual IP address (e.g., the C&C server), or invokes a COM\ninterface that it has never used before or is not supposed to be used (e.g., the ones used by\nHavex), SilentDefense ICS raises an alert.\n\nFigure 4: An example of LAN Communication Pro\fler Behavioral Blueprint\n\nFigure 5 shows the model of normal protocol usage automatically generated by SilentDefense ICS' Deep Protocol Behavior Inspection (DPBI) engine. This model presents all \felds\n(e.g. message types) and \feld values that are normally used for a certain protocol within\nthe analysed network in the form of a protocol tree. The depicted tree was built for the\nDCOM protocol. On the right of the tree, we show how for each protocol \feld it is possible\nto observe in detail and edit the values observed. Again, the DPBI engine guarantees that if\nnetwork devices use unusual (D)COM \felds, the security team will immediately be alerted.\n\nFigure 5: An example of Deep Protocol Behavioral Inspection Behavioral Blueprint\n\n### Detection of network scan\n\nSilentDefense ICS can detect Havex through both LAN CP and DPBI engines. More precisely,\nthe LAN CP might raise an alert for two types of unusual network activities. The \frst is the\nnetwork scan performed by the infected machine (see Figure 3). In fact, when scanning\nthe network, the infected machine might connect to devices with which it normally does\nnot communicate, or is not supposed to communicate. The second unusual activity is the\ninvocation of the IOPCServer COM interfaces. These interfaces are typically used only when\nICS software is installed or updated on a certain device; at SecurityMatters' customers, we\nhave never observed the use of these interfaces during normal operations. Their invocation\n\n\n-----\n\nwould thus result in alert being generated by SilentDefense ICS. If the invocation of these\ninterfaces is followed by a communication with an unknown external IP address (e.g. the\nC&C server - as described in the following section), the host originating the communication\nis likely to be infected by Havex.\nFigure 6 shows an example of an alert generated by the LAN CP when it detects the\nuse of unusual COM interfaces. The unusual interfaces are indicated on the right: they are\nhighlighted in red and marked with a warning sign. On the left, the alert reports details of the\ndevices involved in the communication. This allows to immediately spot any devices infected\nby Havex (the \\source\" device).\n\nFigure 6: Alert generated by SilentDefense ICS when Havex invokes the COM interfaces to\nidentify OPC servers\n\nSimilarly, the DPBI engine would detect and report the use of unusual COM protocol\nelds (and/or values) by any infected device. The alert generated by the DPBI engine would\nindicate the \\source\" of the unusual communication, thus identifying the infected machine,\nand the branch of the protocol tree that is not part of normal operations.\n\n### Detection of communication with C&C server\n\nFurther to detecting the network scan, SilentDefense ICS' LAN CP engine would alert the\nsecurity team also whenever the infected machine attempts to communicate with the malware C&C server. In fact, the infected machine would connect to an IP address that is not\n\\whitelisted\" in the LAN CP model. This enables the security team to stop the communication before any sensitive network information is leaked, for instance by \\blacklisting\" the\nC&C IP in the company \frewall.\nFigure 7 illustrates an example alert generated by the LAN CP engine when a network\ndevice contacts an unusual IP address. The alert highlights in red and marks with a warning\nthe unusual IP address, which can be immediately blacklisted if not recognized by the security\nteam. Figure 7 illustrates an example alert generated by the LAN CP engine when a network\ndevice contacts an unusual IP address. The alert highlights in red and marks with a warning\nthe unusual IP address, which can be immediately blacklisted if not recognized by the security\nteam.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7: Alert generated by SilentDefense ICS when Havex communicates with the C&C\nserver\n\n\n-----\n\n# Conclusions and recommendations\n\nThe Dragon\ry hacker group is carrying out a cyberespionage campaign against energy companies in the US and Europe. So far, the campaign has resulted in the successful looting of\nstrategic information from the energy companies' networks. The malware employed in the\ncampaign, however, may give the attackers the capability to launch subsequent attacks with\ngreater consequences.\nIt is fundamental that critical infrastructure organizations start adopting more progressive\ncountermeasures to today's cyberthreats. The waiting time is over - it has been demonstrated\nmore than once that skillful attackers can easily penetrate critical infrastructure networks, with\nthe potential of causing immeasurable damages to the economy, security, and public safety\nand health of a country.\nWe believe that the implementation of a defense-in-depth strategy is key to successfully\ncounter the increasing cyberthreat. The \frst defensive layer is of course represented by\nrewalls and/or intrusion prevention systems, which keep out of a network the known and easyto-spot attacks. Cybersecurity vendors have already released signatures for their intrusion\nprevention and host-based solutions to detect and stop the malware used by Dragon\ry. As\nindicated by F-Secure, however, 88 variants of the Havex malware have been identi\fed so\nfar. Signatures might not o\u000ber protection to new variants released by Dragon\ry, or to the\nnext malware employed in their campaign. It is therefore vital that along with traditional\ncybersecurity solutions enterprises deploy a non-signature based network monitoring solution\nlike SilentDefense ICS, which does not rely on the knowledge of a threat to detect it and report\nit. SilentDefense ICS is unique in its kind, as no other solution is capable of automatically\nde\fning \\normal network operations\", and of analysing communications down to the values\nexchanged by network devices. This unique approach ensures protection from today's as well\nas tomorrow's threats.\n\n### Acknowledgments\n\nWe thank Damiano Bolzoni and Cli\u000b Gregory for their useful insights.\n\n\n-----\n\n### About SecurityMatters\n\nSecurityMatters is an international company with business in many critical infrastructure\nand industrial automation industries.
