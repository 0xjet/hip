Just\nmonths after the [APT32 watering hole activity against ASEAN-related websites was observed in Fall](https://securelist.com/apt-trends-report-q3-2017/83162/)\n2017, this new activity clearly indicates the association (ASEAN) clearly remains a priority collection\n[target in the region. This new Lotus Blossom campaign delivers a malicious RTF document posing as](https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/d3fc69a9f2ae2c446434abbfbe1693ef0f81a5da0a7f39d27c80d85f4a49c411/detection)\nan ASEAN Defence Minister's Meeting (ADMM) directory (decoy) that also carries an executable\n(payload) embedded as an OLE object, the Elise backdoor.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Elise backdoor is not new malware and has been successfully diagnosed in the past by Industry\nresearchers (e.g. [Palo Alto Unit 42's 2015 report) and more recently by Volexity and](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/apps/pan/public/downloadResource?pagePath=/content/pan/en_US/resources/research/unit42-operation-lotus-blossom) [Accenture.](https://www.accenture.com/t20180127T003755Z__w__/us-en/_acnmedia/PDF-46/Accenture-Security-Dragonfish-Threat-Analysis.pdf#zoom=50)\nEach of these are valuable resources to understanding the Elise malcode, infection\nprocess, and known capabilities of the backdoor. In addition, a current ANY.RUN playback of our\nobserved Elise infection is also available.\n\n[Upon opening of the MS Word document, our embedded file exploits CVE-2017-11882 to drop a](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/cve-2017-11882)\n[malicious fake Norton Security Shell Extension module, 'NavShExt.dll', which is then injected into](https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/6dc2a49d58dc568944fef8285ad7a03b772b9bdf1fe4bddff3f1ade3862eae79/detection)\niexplore.exe to install the backdoor, begin collection, and activate command and control.\n\n[Moving through the infection process, NetWitness Endpoint detects the initial exploit (CVE-2017-1182)](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/cve-2017-11882)\nin action as the Microsoft Equation Editor, 'EQNEDT32.exe', scores high for potentially malicious\nactivity. This same process was also flagged in our any.run playback.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Our malware then spins up an instance of 'iexplore.exe' and injects 'NavShExt.dll' into that process.](https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/6dc2a49d58dc568944fef8285ad7a03b772b9bdf1fe4bddff3f1ade3862eae79/detection)\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile this is happening, the malware establishes persistence by creating an autorun in the registry and\nthen also creates 'thumbcache_1CD60.db' at\n'Users\\admin\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Explorer\\' to store harvested data.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nAs the infection process completes, we now observe Elise network activity (e.g., exfil of victim data and\nC2) through a conveniently hidden instance of Internet Explorer.\n\nThis traffic was also observed in NetWitness Packets, as the malware verifies the host IP address prior\nto kicking off C2 out to [103.236.150[.]14, which is likely compromised infrastructure.](https://community.riskiq.com/search/103.236.150.14)\n\n\n-----\n\nTake note of the cookie set in this HTTP POST, because Lotus Blossom actors go to significant lengths\nto protect this data via both B64 encoding and AES encryption. The actual C2 for Elise takes place\nover \"cookie\" code and (rarely) body content.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nOther infections (from the identical payload) each generated their own decoy domains to populate the\n[host header, but in every case actually used the same hard-coded IP address, 103.236.150[.]14.](https://community.riskiq.com/search/103.236.150.14)\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nAfter our Elise infection had run for about a day, we were visited by the threat actor. While it's unclear\nexactly what the actor may have been looking for, our infected (sandboxed) machine was not it and the\nbackdoor was deleted.\n\n\n-----\n\nBased on both previous activity and this current Lotus Blossom campaign, it is clear that we\nare witnessing the continued rise of cyber tradecraft and activity from nation-states in the Southeast\nAsian theater.\n\nThanks to [Kent Backman,](https://community.rsa.com/rsa-users/50487) [Justin Lamarre, and](https://community.rsa.com/rsa-users/66061) [Ahmed Sonbol for their assistance with this research.](https://community.rsa.com/rsa-users/11862)\n\nThe following samples were used for this analysis:\n\nMalicious RTF\nDropper (SHA256): d3fc69a9f2ae2c446434abbfbe1693ef0f81a5da0a7f39d27c80d85f4a49c411\n[NavShExt.dll (SHA256): 6dc2a49d58dc568944fef8285ad7a03b772b9bdf1fe4bddff3f1ade3862eae79](https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/6dc2a49d58dc568944fef8285ad7a03b772b9bdf1fe4bddff3f1ade3862eae79/detection)\n\n\n-----",
