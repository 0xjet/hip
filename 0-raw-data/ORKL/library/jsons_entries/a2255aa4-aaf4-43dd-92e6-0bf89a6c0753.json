Like the [Wali backdoor, ShadowWali also targets Japanese businesses and](https://securelist.com/old-malware-tricks-to-bypass-detection-in-the-age-of-big-data/78010/)\nwas built by the xxmm malware toolkit. In fact, the same author can be attributed to both\nbackdoors. ShadowWali is likely an earlier version of Wali, making it Wali's \"older brother.\"\n\n[Check out the ServHelper backdoor for more research on backdoors.](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/threat-actor-ta505-targets-financial-enterprises-using-lolbins-and-a-new-backdoor-malware)\n\nIn this blog, we'll review the xxmm backdoor family and show the similarities between Wali\nand ShadowWali. In addition, we will provide new insights regarding the backdoor's postinfection phases.\n\n## The XXMM backdoor family\n\nWali is a backdoor used for targeted attacks. It gathers information about the compromised\nmachines and their networks, in addition to stealing sensitive information and credentials.\nWali’s operators use this information to move laterally in an organization and compromise\nmore machines. There are many similarities between the Wali and ShadowWali:\n\n\n-----\n\n**Same author:PDB paths found in the analyzed binaries indicate that both Wali and**\nShadowWali stem from the same author: user 123. The author likely built the\nbackdoors from three different Visual Studio projects (xxmm2, xxmm3,\nShadowWalker):\n\nC:\\Users\\123\\documents\\visual studio 2010\\Projects\\xxmm2\\Release\\test2.pdb\nC:\\Users\\123\\documents\\visual studio\n2010\\Projects\\xxmm2\\x64\\Release\\BypassUacDll.pdb\nC:\\Users\\123\\Documents\\Visual Studio\n2010\\Projects\\xxmm2\\Release\\loadSetup.pdb\nC:\\Users\\123\\Desktop\\xxmm3\\x64\\Release\\ReflectivLoader.pdb\nC:\\Users\\123\\Documents\\Visual Studio\n2010\\Projects\\shadowWalker\\x64\\Release\\BypassUacDll.pdb\n\nEvidence suggests that Wali’s author has been developing these backdoors and possibly\nother malware since 2015.\n\n**Same builder:Wali and its sibling backdoor were built using the xxmm builder. (see the**\nsection The xxmm builder dissected)\n\n## Similar tactics, techniques and procedures\n\n**Large inflated executables: Both backdoors have unusually large inflated binaries (ranging**\nbetween 50,000KB and 200,000KB). This is a tactic used to evade inspection by traditional\nantivirus software and other security products.\n\n**Process injection: Most samples were observed injecting malicious payloads to Internet**\nExplorer. However, ShadowWali was also observed injecting to LSASS.exe process and to\nexplorer.exe.\n\nA main differentiator between Wali and its sibling backdoor is that Wali’s loader comes with\nboth a 32-bit and 64-bit payload, while ShadowWali tends to deliver 32-bit payloads. Another\nkey difference is the style of the process injection technique. Both backdoors use different\nprocess injection techniques.\n\n\n-----\n\n**C2 Infrastructure---Legitimate and fake Japanese websites**\n\nMany of the C&C domains and IPs lead to legitimate Japanese and/or Japanrelated websites that had been compromised. Additionally, some of the C&C\ndomains that were observed are suspected to be fake websites that mimic the\n**sites of legitimate Japanese businesses.**\nThe compromised sites are almost exclusively written in PHP. This has to do with\none of the features of the xxmm builder, which supports communication over a\n**PHP Tunnel.**\nMany of the compromised sites are hosted by one of Japan’s largest hosting\n[companies: the GMO Internet Group, which has allegedly fallen victim to](https://www.gmo.jp/en/)\ncyberattacks [in the past.](https://japan.cnet.com/article/35097939/)\n\n## Wali backdoor\n\nThe Wali backdoor emerged in Japan in early 2016. It’s dubbed Wali because of the\nindicative strings found inside its binaries, as seen in the screenshot of the strings from a\ndecrypted Wali binary (SHA-1: 3603163413A8E4E03758C9FB7673E1866FF29CB5):\n\n## Wali’s Process Injection\n\nOne of the consistent characteristics of Wali is the injection of the malicious payloads (either\n32-bit or 64-bit) into a host process. As seen in our analysis of the xxmm builder (See the\nsection The xxmm builder dissected), the default host process of choice is Internet\nExplorer (iexplore.exe). The screenshot below, taken from a real attack attempt on one of our\nJapanese customers, shows Wali’s loader (srvhost.exe) injecting code into Internet Explorer.\nLet’s have a look at the injection detected by Cybereason:\n\n\n-----\n\nSrvhost.exe loader injecting to Internet Explorer. Visual taken from the Cybereason Platform.\n\nWali injection routine combines implementations of \"Reflective DLL injection\" along with\nanother injection technique. Wali’s author clearly borrowed code from Stephen Fewer’s\nfamous [ReflectiveDLLInjection project found on Github.](https://github.com/stephenfewer/ReflectiveDLLInjection)\n\n**Stephen Fewer’s Reflective DLL Injection code on Github:**\n\n**Excerpt taken from Wali's process injection routine:**\n\n\n-----\n\nHowever, a few alterations were made to the code to accommodate the 32-bit and 64-bit\npayload delivery. Following is a simplified flow of the injection routine, with main differences\nmarked in red:\n\n**CreateProcessA → OpenProcess → VirtualAllocEx → WriteProcessMemory →**\n**GetVersionEx → CreateRemoteThread/NtCreateThreadEx**\n\n## Step 1: Create iexplore.exe in suspended mode\n\nSince Wali’s author chose to inject to Internet Explorer---a host process that doesn’t\nnecessarily run all the time---Wali first needs to make sure the browser runs, and launches it\nin a suspended mode (creation flag = CREATE_SUSPENDED):\n\n## Step 2: Allocating two RWX regions in target process and injecting the payloads\n\n\n-----\n\nNext, the loader will allocate two RWX regions in the target process and write the 32-bit and\n64-bit payload respectively.\n\nIt's interesting to notice the size of the actual injected payloads---At 120KB to 144KB, the\nactual payloads are tiny compared to the 100MB to 200MB loader that’s inflated with junk\ncode.\n\n## Step 3: Determining OS version and executing a remote thread in target process\n\nDuring the final step of the injection routine, Wali's loader determines the OS version of the\ncompromised host. If the value of dwMajorVersion is lower than 6 (older than Vista), the\nloader will call CreateRemoteThread to execute the injected payload:\n\n\n-----\n\n[Otherwise, it will use the rare and undocumented NtCreateThreadEX API to execute the](http://securityxploded.com/ntcreatethreadex.php)\ninjected code. The motivation behind the version check is most likely to overcome Windows\n“Session Separation” mitigation introduced in Windows Vista:\n\n## C2 communication\n\nWali uses GET requests over HTTP port 80 to communicate with its C&C servers, which are\n**mostly compromised websites. Most samples have a set of three hard-coded URLs that**\nare decrypted at runtime. Wali will try to reach all three URLs, one after the other, until it\nreceives a response from the server:\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter communicating with the C&C server, Wali attempts do the following:\n\n1. Download a payload from the server using the URLDownloadToFileW API:\n\n2. Decrypt the payload:\n\n3. Parse the payload and execute it.\n\nWali can support different types of payloads from the C&C servers, including: PowerShell\ncommands and additional plugins. Even ShadowWali was delivered by some of\ncompromised C&C servers.\n\nThis screenshot was taken from one of subroutines in charge of parsing and executing the\npayloads, in this case PowerShell commands:\n\n\n-----\n\n## Analysis of Wali's C&C payloads\n\nThe Wali backdoor was observed downloading two different types of post-infection payloads:\n\n**Reconnaissance and Credential Theft Plugin: This payload executes a series of**\ncommands to gather information on the compromised host and its network\n[environment. In addition, it contains a Mimikatz module to dump locally stored](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz)\ncredentials.\n**xxmm malware: This is a variant of ShadowWali, which exhibits slightly different**\ncapabilities and a different persistence mechanism.\n\n## Payload one: Reconnaissance and credential theft plugin\n\nDuring an investigation, Cybereason analysts noticed that Wali attempted to download the\nfollowing payload after reaching one of its hard-coded URLs:\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce the payload is downloaded and decrypted in-memory, Wali writes its content to a\ntemporary file:\n\n**Sep9808.tmp - 2CE05CD6AF79B10F9EE8CBEBAE8D439FF0F30F60**\n\nThe temporary file is a binary file in 101MB size:\n\nThe file’s timestamp indicates that it was compiled in August 2016:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe downloaded payload performs a similar process injection routine as Wali, namely\ninjecting a malicious code to a new instance of iexplore.exe (memory address\n0x140000000):\n\nThe plugin executable size is considerably bigger than Wali’s payloads: 896KB as opposed\nto Wali’s 120KB to 140KB injected payloads.\n\n**0x140000000’s SHA-1: 1C822CB9B4AFA82099B8EF2B909204D9D8F4626D**\n\nThe payload launches a series of reconnaissance commands after it’s executed:\n\n**Ipconfig /all: TCP/IP configuration of all network adapters on the host.**\n**Netstat -ano: TCP and UDP connections, open ports and owner processes.**\n**Net user: Enumerating user accounts on the host.**\n**Systeminfo: Detailed configuration information about a computer and its**\noperating system.\n**find /i /n \"[Device Install\" C:\\windows\\inf\\setupapi.dev.log: Enumerating**\ndevices that are installed on the host.\n**reg query HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Enum\\USB**\n**/s: Enumerating USB drives.**\n\nReconnaissance commands found in the memory of the injected iexplore.exe\n\n\n-----\n\nLast but not least, the injected code will execute an embedded Mimikatz binary in order to\nsteal locally stored credentials and possibly perform lateral movement.\n\n## Payload two: Variant of ShadowWali\n\nOur investigation led us to a compromised Japanese site where the attackers uploaded their\nmalicious PHP code and the other xxmm payload (scommand.txt, SHA-1:\n52921e7b488ee1a48ca098247a07d17ce610c235).\n\n\n-----\n\nSimilar to the previous C&C payload, the scommand.txt file also contains an encrypted\npayload:\n\n\n-----\n\n**Scommand.txt SHA-1: 52921e7b488ee1a48ca098247a07d17ce610c235**\n\nAfter Wali uses the hard-coded decryption key to decrypt the payload in memory, it writes the\ndecrypted contents to a .tmp file in %temp% folder. Once the .tmp file is written to disk and\nexecuted, it will also create a batch file that will be used for self-deletion:\n\nThis self-deletion mechanism is consistent to both backdoors of the \"xxmm\" family, and is\nfound in the code of its \"loadsetup\" component:\n\nC:\\Users\\123\\Documents\\Visual Studio 2010\\Projects\\xxmm2\\Release\\loadSetup.pdb\n\n**Downloaded payload details:**\n\n**File name: rr2E9E.tmp (original name: test.exe)**\n\n**SHA-1: 133C7B74E35D9DCC3BD43764CB18E59C1B74190F**\n\n**PDB Path: C:\\Users\\123\\Documents\\Visual Studio**\n2010\\Projects\\shadowWalker\\x64\\Release\\BypassUacDll.pdb\n\n\n-----\n\nrr2E9E.tmp binary s file timestamp is from May 2016:\n\nThe resources section of the PE file contains two additional PE files:\n\n**102 (32bit payload)- 8123534DDE8AC4AF983DB302A06427AAB00EDD55**\n\n**105 (64bit payload) - BC725B8FF4446A72539F5C5B0532CC0264A51D9C**\n\n## ShadowWali: Another xxmm backdoor\n\n**ShadowWali is also a member of the xxmm backdoor family, written by the 123 author and**\ncan be considered Wali’s older brother. The timestamp of most of the observed backdoor\nsample dates back to 2015 and continues until mid-2016. Wali’s timestamps, meanwhile, run\nbetween 2016 and 2017. This could be viewed as either an older version of Wali or as a\nseparate, older project the 123 author developed.\n\nAlthough there are many similarities between the two siblings, they are also clear\ndifferences:\n\n**Strings Discrepancy: The indicative \"Wali\" string is not found on any of the samples**\nwe identified as ShadowWali. In fact, the binaries of ShadowWali contains many strings\nthat do not appear in Wali backdoor. At the same time, some of the strings that appear\nin ShadowWali samples, show resemblance to strings usually found in Metasploit’s\nMeterpreter payloads:\n\nStrings indicative of the xxmm backdoor family:\n\n\n-----\n\nStrings indicating the usage of stdapi functions, which are also found in Metasploit's\nMeterpreter:\n\n\n-----\n\n**Mostly 32-bit payloads: Most observed samples have 32-bit support, however, later**\nsamples also came with 64-bit support. This could be regarded as the missing link in\nthe evolution of Wali.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Different RC4 key: ShadowWali a slightly shorter hard-coded RC4 key (1234) as**\nopposed to Wali, which uses 12345.\n\n**Different PDB paths: ShadowWali contains different PDB paths than Wali:**\n\nC:\\Users\\123\\Documents\\Visual Studio\n2010\\Projects\\xxmm2\\Release\\loadSetup.pdb\nC:\\Users\\123\\Desktop\\xxmm3\\x64\\Release\\ReflectivLoader.pdb\nC:\\Users\\123\\Documents\\Visual Studio\n2010\\Projects\\shadowWalker\\x64\\Release\\BypassUacDll.pdb\n**Differences in process injection:**\n\nSome samples inject to LSASS.exe and explorer.exe instead of Internet Explorer.\nDifferent process injection routine, using different API calls.\n**Service-based persistence mechanism, as opposed to Wali’s tendency to use the**\nclassic registry autorun.\n\n## Analysis of the process injection routine\n\n\n-----\n\nShadowWali uses a [less common and evasive style of process hollowing, as opposed to](https://www.blackhat.com/docs/asia-17/materials/asia-17-KA-What-Malware-Authors-Don't-Want-You-To-Know-Evasive-Hollow-Process-Injection-wp.pdf)\nWali's injection routine that uses different APIs and also combines reflective DLL injection:\n\n**ShadowWali simplified injection routine** **Wali’s simplified injection routine**\n\n\n**CreateProcessA → VirtualAlloc →**\n**GetThreadContext → VirtualAllocEx →**\n**WriteProcessMemory →**\n**SetThreadContext → ResumeThread**\n\n\n**CreateProcessA → OpenProcess→**\n**VirtualAllocEx→ WriteProcessMemory→**\n**GetVersionEx → CreateRemoteThread /**\n**NtCreateThreadEx**\n\n\nExample of the last stage of ShadowWali’s process injection, showing\n_SetThreadContext/ResumeThread APIs which are used in that style of \"evasive process_\nhollowing:\"\n\n**Variation in injected host processes**\n\nAs opposed to Wali’s tendency of injecting to iexplore.exe, ShadowWali seems to exhibit\nmore variation, and we observed it injecting code to explorer.exe and LSASS.exe, as can be\nseen in the following example:\n\n**File Name: SMSvcHost.exe, SHA-1: 168524E2292E376B2036C41E691A434BAC3A89E**\n\n\n-----\n\n## Additional persistence mechanism\n\nIn addition to the previously documented persistence mechanism using the classic registry\nautorun (currentversion\\run), some samples showed a different persistence mechanism that\nis based on Windows Service as autorun, as can be seen below:\n\nFile: C:\\Program Files\\Common Files\\System\\reginie.exe\n\nSHA-1: 7DDEDADB81EE7A00F07F40686F078A7974E0C2D1\n\n**_HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\services\\swprv7_**\n\n## C&C payloads - Image file Steganography\n\nWhile analyzing the C&C communication of ShadowWali, it was noticed that some of the\ncompromised sites served image files with hidden code inside them:\n\nhxxp://[REDACTED].co.jp/magento/media/css/css.php\n\n\n-----\n\nThe image files all had one thing in common; at the end of the file, there was an appended\nsection containing the encrypted payload. The section begins with “###RRRR” and ends with\n“ZZZZ###:\"\n\nWhen the image is downloaded, ShadowWali will search for those start-end markers, and\nonce found, it will decrypt the payload between them. The decrypted payload results in a\nnew URL, leading to another domain:\n\nhxxp://[REDACTED]/data/plugin/upgrade.php?t0=000052ef&t1=0&t2=bb9c8e4d&t3=0\n\nThis is consistent with the built-in “changeURL” functionality found in the sample’s binary:\n\n\n-----\n\n## The xxmm builder dissected\n\nCybereason managed to obtain a copy of the xxmm builder, the tool with which the malware\nauthor \"123\" generated the xxmm family backdoors:\n\n**File Name: xxmm2_build.exe**\n\n**SHA-1: E5f5d64bf49b10dd4591907f34357be6cecf55b7**\n\n**[Fun fact: The icon of the “xxmm builder” was taken from “Batman: The Dark Knight Rises.”](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1345836/)**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe builder is written in C++ and was compiled in January 2015, which is consistent with the\nappearance of ShadowWali and the timestamps found in the samples’ executables.\n\nThe builder is part of the xxmm2 project and was also generated on user 123's machine, as\nindicated in the PDB path:\n\nAs seen in the builder’s main menu dialog, the builder consists of three steps to generate the\nbackdoors:\n\n## Step 1: Configure kernel module\n\nAlthough the word \"kernel\" suggests rootkit capabilities, the xxmm backdoor family operates\nin user-mode and was not observed implementing kernel-related rootkit capabilities.\n\nThis step is mainly used for:\n\n**Setting up encryption keys**\n**Configuring C2 communication**\n\nSteganography-based (payloads hiding in image files)\nPHP tunnel\n\nThis explains the previous observations of steganography using “.jpg” images. In addition, it\nclarifies another observation Cybereason made regarding the compromised websites which\nare written in PHP. Looking at the PHP Tunnel feature, this makes perfect sense:\n\n\n-----\n\n## Step 2: Configure loader/setup module\n\nThis step handles the following components of the malware:\n\n**Loader (mainly the injection routine)**\n**Persistence either by service or registry run key**\n**Configuring host process for injection. Notice the default value is iexplore.exe,**\nwhich is consistent with most of the observed “xxmm” backdoors.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Step 3: Generate trojan\n\nThe final step in the trojan generation handles configuration of both 32-bit and 64-bit\npayloads, as well as the auto-deletion code (loadSetup).\n\n\n-----\n\n## Connection to the ShadowWalker Rootkit\n\nThe name “ShadowWalker1.0” appears at the third step of the builder, and populates the\n“Destination File Path” field. The same name is found in the PDB path of some of\nShadowWali's samples. For example:\n\n**rr2E9E.tmp - 133C7B74E35D9DCC3BD43764CB18E59C1B74190F**\n\nThe [ShadowWalker1.0 rootkit was a proof-of-concept rootkit introduced by Sparks and Butler](https://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-jp-05/bh-jp-05-sparks-butler.pdf)\nat [Black Hat Japan in 2005. The code is now open source and can be found on Github.](https://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-jp-05/bh-jp-05-sparks-butler.pdf)\nShadowWalker1.0's rootkit functionality was not observed in any of the xxmm family\n**backdoors.**\n\nIt is not completely clear why the xxmm builder references the ShadowWalker rootkit.\nHowever, the builder's menu clearly indicates that it can support rootkit modules (probably\noptional). These indications are found in step 1 and 2 of the builder, with indicative names\nsuch as: \"kernel module\" and \"Kernel template\".\n\n## Conclusion\n\n\n-----\n\nThe xxmm backdoor family has been attacking Japanese targets since 2015. The backdoor\nfamily consists of two main backdoors and additional post-infection plugins used for\nreconnaissance, credential dumping and possibly lateral movement. In this research, we\nhave presented the similarities and differences between Wali and ShadowWali and proven\nthat they have one father, the 123 author. Whether it’s a case of two different backdoors or\nan evolution of one malware over two years is a matter of interpretation. To date, Wali and\nShadowWali are still actively targeting Japanese organizations.\n\nThe identity of the 123 author remains unknown. However, there are indications that suggest\nthat the threat actor behind Wali resides in Asia. From profiling perspective, the evidence\nshow that the 123 author has a penchant for adapting and customizing previously introduced\ntechniques and tools, such as the reflective loader, Metasploit modules and even the builder\nitself could be adapted from other builders.\n\nCompared to other modern backdoors, the xxmm backdoor family doesn’t stand out or seem\nvery sophisticated. However, the backdoors are proven to be effective as they successfully\ninfected dozens of endpoints over two years, while evading traditional security products. The\nbackdoors’ strongest feature is the inflated file sizes that can reach 200MB. The motivation\nbehind the inflated files probably stems from the author's perception that certain security\nsolutions might not inspect large files, which will then allow the inflated files to evade\ndetection.\n\n## IOCs\n\n**Wali payloads:**\n\n381a99c6abe218863f352a76941c9d3a4369740a\n\n878B77556EC3C3572D09F84CC2D8F60CD92F7D00\n\nD044B40D4121689A1AED655DA243D2917B866B6F\n\nA0F8CFDDB34CF44A5588903AF73F5152AF84C47E\n\n4F5748FCE8643B95DC15511816CD8045D0A470CC\n\n2CDE37F62202E4A0B3E6B600293563716E099413\n\n2E340AD74FB71D86787D2801055029C8C0E0DF5B\n\n9CC5BA99B05A0B26F04EE5F6A3EC4088B06C6B17\n\n802722295013D866855BDED0853D6AABC3A93A6F\n\n29bcc33d2b5b6ea192d1b87ab480f10d83406387\n\n\n-----\n\n**ShadowWali (xxmm):**\n\nC4E0035E6BB3C4A42DD593CB578D9563A2E4D0C7\n\n13F00E24157AF0F23558F400FACBB015606C4E38\n\n3A5975BE9B3E9B1909D0F8EFB6ADD0FFE84ADB76\n\n168524E2292E376B2036C41E691A434BAC3A89E1\n\n367C85179A30B20DB2163CDB0CEA6D17DD164C4A\n\n133C7B74E35D9DCC3BD43764CB18E59C1B74190F\n\n**xxmm builder:**\n\nE5f5d64bf49b10dd4591907f34357be6cecf55b7\n\n**C&C payloads:**\n\n2CE05CD6AF79B10F9EE8CBEBAE8D439FF0F30F60\n\n1C822CB9B4AFA82099B8EF2B909204D9D8F4626D\n\n52921e7b488ee1a48ca098247a07d17ce610c235\n\n**File names:**\n\nSrvhost.exe\n\nOledb32.exe\n\nRavRtlUpd.exe\n\nSMSvcHost.exe\n\nSpmapi.exe\n\n*Domains and IPs will be discussed in part two of the blog.\n\n\n-----\n\nAbout the Author\n\n**Assaf Dahan**\n\nAssaf has over 15 years in the InfoSec industry.
