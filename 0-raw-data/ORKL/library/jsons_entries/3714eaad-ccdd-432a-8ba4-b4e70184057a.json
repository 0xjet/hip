Intrigued by their findings, I conducted](https://blog.cyble.com/2023/04/26/threat-actor-selling-new-atomic-macos-amos-stealer-on-telegram/)\na personal investigation and gathered more information about AMOS infostealer. Initially, I\nplanned to conduct a technical analysis of the stealer and its infrastructure. However, delving\ndeeper into AMOS, I decided to shift the main focus and present the analysis of the threat\nactors behind the stealer instead. As you go with me on this journey, I hope you don’t get lost\nin my thought process. Let’s go.\n\n\n-----\n\nI started my investigation by locating the Telegram channel where the stealer was advertised.\nThe first Telegram channel was created on April 9th and has 366 subscribers. However, on\nApril 29th, the admin of the channel declared that they were leaving the project, transferring\nownership to the user @ping3r and a new coder, adding that he leaves it up to the users to\ndecide how to view it — as a selling point or circumstance. Later the same day, the second\nchannel related to AMOS was created, which currently has 1155 subscribers and where the\ncontact person is referenced as @ez360x ( I presume this is a new coder).Additionally, a\nsupport group was created, which currently has only 15 members. Interestingly, when I saw\nthe new channel, what struck me first was the channel’s avatar (see Figure 1). I couldn’t get\nover the feeling that I had seen this avatar somewhere before. I did some searching, and\nvoila — I found it.\n\n## Maybe XORacle?\n\nThe profile image is similar to the avatar of the malware development team — XORacle,\nwhich offers malware development services on one of the most popular Russian-speaking\nforums (see Figure 2). XORacle mentions in their advertisement that they have expertise in\ndeveloping various types of malware, including RATs, Stealers, Clippers, and Loaders, using\nRust and Go programming languages (AMOS was written in Go). They also offer malware\ndevelopment services for macOS. Coincidence or not, at this point I can only speculate\nabout the potential relation of XORacle to AMOS.\n\n## Possible connection to WhiteSnake stealer\n\nGoing back to Telegram, I browsed through the AMOS support group and noticed that out of\n[fifteen members, one of them was named @WhiteSnake (see Figure 3).WhiteSnake is a](https://blog.cyble.com/2023/02/24/new-whitesnake-stealer-offered-for-sale-via-maas-model/)\nstealer that emerged on the market in February 2023, targeting Windows and Linux\noperating system users. The user @WhiteSnake was an admin of the Telegram channel\nadvertising WhiteSnake stealer.\n\nFurther, WhiteSnake is present on the Russian-speaking forum. While browsing through it, I\nnoticed that WhiteSnake asked a user to message them privately in response to their\nquestion about the development of a macOS stealer (see Figure 4). Furthermore, on March\n17th, our user posted an interesting statement, citing — “Here lives Uzbek”( see Figure 5),\nwhich suggests that the user may be originally from Uzbekistan (remember this detail!).\n\nFigure 5. WhiteSnake’s profile on Russian-speaking web forum.\nAs I continued investigating, the next step was to check whether the stealer was advertised\nelsewhere on Telegram. Lucky me — it was. Although in my earlier examination ( two weeks\nago), I identified at least seven instances of AMOS advertisements on the various channels, I\nnoticed that earlier advertisements were removed from most channels except for one.\nAccident or not, it was still there. It was necessary since the earlier advertisements contained\n\n\n-----\n\na critical element — mentioning of another person associated with a channel — a user\nremoved later from all the posts on the channel — @line_liner (see Figure 6).Could\n**@line_liner be the primary coder of AMOS? Well, yes.**\n\nSo, right now we have three profiles of interest:@ping3r, @line_liner and @ez360x. Let’s\nlook into each and every one of them individually to see what we can find.\n\n## User 1: ping3r (Role — AMOS owner)\n\nThe first user of interest is @ping3r, who is the present owner of the AMOS stealer. After\nconducting some research, I found out that @ping3r is the owner of the private forum\nCOOKIE.PRO, which has been active since 2018. To join the forum, interested parties must\npay a fee ranging from $150 for users to $250 for sellers. The website also has a Telegram\ngroup with 3,633 members, where @ping3r is referred to as the admin(see Figure 8).\nAdditionally, @ping3r serves as an escrow on the forum COOKIE.PRO. The forum\nadvertises several familiar infostealers, including WhiteSnake and Titan.\n\nFigure 7. Atomic macOS advertisement on the COOKIE.PRO website\nFigure 8. Screenshot of COOCKIE.PRO Telegram group.\n\n## User 2: line_liner (Role — AMOS developer)\n\nThe next person of interest is @line_liner, who I believe was an admin of the first channel\nand a coder behind AMOS, and the mentioning of who was erased after the ownership of the\nstealer was transferred to another person. When I checked the Telegram of @line_liner, I\nnoticed an interesting detail in their profile picture: a traditional Uzbek hat called Tubeteika\n(see Figure 9). This makes me think there might be a connection between @line_liner and\nthe WhiteSnake developer. What if they are the same person? Intriguing, right?\n\n## User 3: ez360x (Role — new coder)\n\nLastly, @ez360x, new coder. Unfortunately, I found nothing about this user, but he seems to\nbe a “no less popular coder”. Could it be previously mentioned XORacle? At this point, I can\nonly guess.\n\n## Was it Titan after all?\n\nAs I delved deeper into the investigation for this article, I uncovered some additional\ninteresting information which contradicts or supports my previous statements. On May 11th,\na Telegram channel called Abbadon posted that on March 18th, the developer of Titan\nStealer ceased working on it and sold it to Aurora (another info-stealer). Additionally, it was\nmentioned that Aurora, who now owns Titan Stealer, focused entirely on operating Titan,\nceasing all Aurora operations as of May 1st. Furthermore, according to the information in the\n\n\n-----\n\nchannel — the original developer of Titan started working on developing Atomic macOS\nStealer (AMOS), which was later sold to a user named @ping3r (see Figure 11). Abbadon\nshared a screenshot of forwarded messages from @ping3r indicating the purchase of\nAMOS from Titan (see Figure 10).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAlthough Abaddon’s post, in a way, disproves my initial belief that WhiteSnake is the one\nwho developed AMOS, there is no solid evidence to state that they are not. What if\nWhiteSnake and Titan are the same people, after all? I don’t know it, but working on this\ninvestigation and having the AMOS as a case study shows the tight interconnectedness\nbetween the users behind the development of malicious software. There is a high chance\nthat the same person or team (like XORacle) might be behind several malicious software that\nwe know under different names. I won’t be surprised if they operate under the name of a\nlegitimate software company with an office, regular working hours and a coffee machine\nstanding in the corner. I hope you enjoyed being on this journey with me. See you!\n\n\n-----",
