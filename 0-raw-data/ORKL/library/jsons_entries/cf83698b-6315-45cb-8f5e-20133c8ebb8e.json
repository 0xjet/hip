    "plain_text": "# New \"SockDetour\" Fileless, Socketless Backdoor Targets U.S. Defense Contractors\n\n**[thehackernews.com/2022/02/new-sockdetour-fileless-socketless.html](https://thehackernews.com/2022/02/new-sockdetour-fileless-socketless.html)**\n\nFebruary 25, 2022\n\nCybersecurity researchers have taken the wraps off a previously undocumented and stealthy\ncustom malware called SockDetour that targeted U.S.-based defense contractors with the goal of\nbeing used as a secondary implant on compromised Windows hosts.\n\n\"SockDetour is a backdoor that is designed to remain stealthily on compromised Windows servers\nso that it can serve as a backup backdoor in case the primary one fails,\" Palo Alto Networks' Unit\n[42 threat intelligence said in a report published Thursday. \"It is difficult to detect, since it operates](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/sockdetour/)\nfilelessly and socketlessly on compromised Windows servers.\"\n\nEven more concerningly, SockDetour is believed to have been used in attacks since at least July\n2019, based on a compilation timestamp on the sample, implying that the backdoor successfully\nmanaged to slip past detection for over two-and-a-half years.\n\n\n-----\n\n[The attacks have been attributed to a threat cluster it tracks as TiltedTemple (aka DEV-0322 by](https://thehackernews.com/2021/12/cisa-warns-of-actively-exploited.html)\nMicrosoft), which is the designated moniker for a hacking group operating out of China and was\n[instrumental in exploiting zero-day](https://thehackernews.com/2021/09/cisa-warns-of-actively-exploited-zoho.html) [flaws in Zoho ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus and](https://thehackernews.com/2021/11/experts-detail-malicious-code-dropped.html)\nServiceDesk Plus deployments as a launchpad for malware attacks last year.\n\nThe ties to TiltedTemple come from overlaps in the attack infrastructure, with one of the commandand-control (C2) servers that was used to facilitate the distribution of malware for the late 2021\ncampaigns also hosting the SockDetour backdoor, alongside a memory dumping utility and\nnumerous web shells for remote access.\n\nUnit 42 said it unearthed evidence of at least four defense contractors targeted by the new wave of\nattacks, resulting in the compromise of one of them.\n\nThe intrusions also predate the attacks that occurred through compromised Zoho ManageEngine\nservers in August 2021 by a month. Analysis of the campaign has revealed that SockDetour was\ndelivered from an external FTP server to a U.S.-based defense contractor's internet-facing\nWindows server on July 27, 2021.\n\n\n-----\n\nCyberSecurity\n\n\n\"The FTP server that hosted SockDetour was a compromised Quality Network Appliance Provider\n(QNAP) small office and home office (SOHO) network-attached storage (NAS) server,\" the\nresearchers pointed out. \"The NAS server is known to have multiple vulnerabilities, including a\n[remote code execution vulnerability,](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/ech0raix-ransomware-soho/) [CVE-2021-28799.\"](https://thehackernews.com/2021/04/new-qnap-nas-flaws-exploited-in-recent.html)\n\nWhat's more, the same server is said to have been already infected with the QLocker ransomware,\nraising the possibility the TiltedTemple actor leveraged the aforementioned flaw to gain\nunauthorized initial access.\n\nSockDetour, for its part, is fashioned as a stand-in backdoor that hijacks legitimate processes'\nnetwork sockets to establish its own encrypted C2 channel, followed by loading an unidentified\nplugin DLL file retrieved from the server.\n\n\n-----\n\nThus, SockDetour requires neither opening a listening port from which to receive a connection nor\ncalling out to an external network to establish a remote C2 channel,\" the researchers said. \"This\nmakes the backdoor more difficult to detect from both host and network level.\"\n\nSHARE _�_ _�_ _�_ _�_ __\nSHARE _�_\n\n\n-----",
