Fast forward to late 2017 and the group continues to deploy its\nmalicious tools, including disk-wiping malware known as KillDisk, to attack a number of\ntargets.\n\nThe Lazarus Group gained notoriety especially after cyber-sabotage against Sony Pictures\nEntertainment in 2014. Fast forward to late 2017 and the group continues to deploy its\nmalicious tools, including disk-wiping malware known as KillDisk, to attack a number of\ntargets.\n\nOur analysis shows that the cybercriminals behind the attack against an online casino in\n[Central America, and several other targets in late-2017, were most likely the infamous](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/new-killdisk-variant-hits-financial-organizations-in-latin-america/)\nLazarus hacking group. In all of these incidents the attackers utilized similar toolsets,\nincluding KillDisk; the disk-wiping tool that was executed on compromised machines.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Lazarus toolset\n\nThe Lazarus Group was first identified in Novetta’s report [Operation Blockbuster in](https://www.operationblockbuster.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Operation-Blockbuster-Report.pdf)\n[February 2016; US‑CERT and the FBI call this group Hidden Cobra. These cybercriminals](https://www.us-cert.gov/HIDDEN-COBRA-North-Korean-Malicious-Cyber-Activity)\nrose into prominence with the infamous case of cyber-sabotage against Sony Pictures\nEntertainment.\n\nSome of the past attacks attributed to the Lazarus Group attracted the interest of security\n[researchers who relied on Novetta et al’s white papers with hundreds of pages describing](https://www.operationblockbuster.com/resources/)\nthe tools used in the attacks – [the Polish and Mexican banks;](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/02/16/demystifying-targeted-malware-used-polish-banks/) [the WannaCryptor outbreak;](https://www.malwaretech.com/2017/05/how-to-accidentally-stop-a-global-cyber-attacks.html)\n[phishing campaigns against US defense contractors, etc – and provides grounds for the](https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2017/08/unit42-blockbuster-saga-continues/)\nattribution of these attacks to the Lazarus Group.\n\nNote that the Lazarus toolset (i.e. the collection of all files that are considered by the\nsecurity industry as fingerprints of the group’s activity) is quite broad, and we believe there\nare numerous subgroups. Unlike toolsets used by some other cybercriminal groups, none of\nthe source code of any Lazarus tools has ever been disclosed in a public leak.\n\nOn top of custom tools, the Lazarus Group also leverages projects that are either available\nfrom GitHub or provided commercially.\n\n## Lazarus tools in casino attack\n\n\n-----\n\nIn this section, we review some of the tools that were detected on numerous servers and\nendpoints in the network of an online casino in Central America. These were used in\nconjunction with the destructive KillDisk samples described later. We explain why we\nbelieve they are linked to Lazarus. ESET detects known Lazarus malware as\nWin32/NukeSped or Win64/NukeSped.\n\nAlmost all of these tools are designed to run as a Windows service. Administrator privileges\nare necessary to achieve this, which means the attackers expected to have to have those\nprivileges at the time of tool design or compilation.\n\n### TCP backdoor\n\nWin64/NukeSped.W is a console application that is installed in the system as a service.\nOne of the initial execution steps is dynamically resolving the required DLL names, on the\nstack:\n\n\n-----\n\nLikewise, procedure names of Windows APIs are constructed dynamically. In this particular\nsample, they are visible in plaintext; in other past samples that we’ve analyzed they were\nbase64-encoded, encrypted or resolved on the stack character by character:\n\nBoth are typical traits of Lazarus malware. Another typical Lazarus backdoor characteristic\nis also seen in this backdoor: it listens on a specific port that it ensures is not blocked by the\nfirewall:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe backdoor supports 20 commands whose functionality is similar to previously analyzed\nLazarus samples (note that the command names here did not originate from the attackers\nbut were created by an ESET malware analyst):\n\nIt creates several files on the file system. The listening port is stored in a text file named\n%WINDOWS%\\Temp\\p. The file %WINDOWS%\\Temp\\perflog.evt contains a list of paths of\nbinary files to be injected, executed or written to the Registry depending upon the beginning\ncharacter:\n\nIn case of the “+” option, the output data of cmd.exe /c “%s 2>> %s” (or cmd.exe /c “%s >>\n%s 2>&1”) is logged to %WINDOWS%\\Temp\\perflog.dat.\n\n### Session hijacker\n\nWin64/NukeSped.AB is a console application that creates a process as another currently–\nlogged-in user on the victim’s system (similar to command number 17 from the previously\ndescribed TCP backdoor).\n\n\n-----\n\n[It is a Themida-protected variant of a sample described by Kaspersky. In our case, it was](https://securelist.com/files/2017/04/Lazarus_Under_The_Hood_PDF_final.pdf)\ninstalled as C:\\Users\\public\\ps.exe. It accepts three parameters.\n\nA static look shows the same file properties in both these samples: the same PE\ncompilation timestamp, identical Rich Header linker data (indicating that the linker was\nVisual Studio 2010 (10.00)), and part of the resources version info matches:\n\nWhile the PE timestamp and the resources are stolen from the legitimate Microsoft\nPREVHOST.EXE file from Windows 7 SP1, the linker data was not: the original Microsoft\nfile was compiled and linked by Visual Studio 2008 (9.00).\n\nOur consequent, dynamic analysis confirmed that this file – found in the compromised\ncasino’s network – is related to the session hijacker used in the Polish and Mexican attacks.\n\n### Loader/installer\n\nThis is a simple command line tool accepting several switches. Its purpose is to work with\nprocesses (injecting/killing a process by PID or by name), services (terminating/reinstalling\na service) or files (drop/remove). Its exact functionality depends on the parameters.\n\n## KillDisk variants\n\nKillDisk is a generic detection name that ESET uses for destructive malware with disk\nwiping capabilities, such as damaging boot sectors and overwriting then deleting (system)\nfiles, followed by a reboot to render the machine unusable. Although all KillDisk malware\nhas similar functionality, as a generic detection, individual samples do not necessarily have\nstrong code similarities or relationships. Such generic malware detections usually have\nmany “sub-families”, distinguished by the detection suffix (e.g. Win32/KillDisk.NBO in this\n\n\n-----\n\ncase). Sub-family variants that do have strong code similarities, are sometimes seen\nseparate cyberattacks and thus can help us make connections, as here. Other cases, for\n[example the directed cyberattacks against high-value targets in Ukraine in December 2015](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2016/01/03/blackenergy-sshbeardoor-details-2015-attacks-ukrainian-news-media-electric-industry/)\n[and December 2016, also employed KillDisk malware, but those samples were from](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2016/12/13/rise-telebots-analyzing-disruptive-killdisk-attacks/)\ndifferent KillDisk sub-families, so are most likely unrelated to these attacks.\n\nIn the Central American online casino case, we detected two variants of\nWin32/KillDisk.NBO in their network. This malware was detected on over 100 machines in\nthe organization. There are several possible explanations for its deployment, with the\nattackers covering their tracks after an espionage operation, or its direct use for extortion or\nsabotage, being the most probable. In any case, the impact against a single organization is\nlarge.\n\nBased on our telemetry, the simultaneous use of the detected Win32/KillDisk.NBO variants,\nand the other known Lazarus malware on the targeted network, we are confident this\nKillDisk malware was deployed by Lazarus, rather than by another, unrelated attacker.\n\nOur analysis of these two Win32/KillDisk.NBO variants revealed that they share many code\nsimilarities. Further, they are almost identical to the KillDisk variant used against financial\n[organizations in Latin America, as described by Trend Micro.](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/new-killdisk-variant-hits-financial-organizations-in-latin-america/)\n\nIn this online casino case, the KillDisk variants’ path was typically:\nC:\\Windows\\Temp\\dimens.exe\n\nThe actual embedded payload is injected into the system process werfault.exe:\n\n\n-----\n\nOne of the variants was protected using the commercial PE protector VMProtect in its 3\ngeneration, which made unpacking it trickier. The attackers most likely did not buy a\nVMProtect license but have rather used leaked or pirated copies available on the Internet.\n[Using protectors is common for the Lazarus group: during the Polish and Mexican attacks in](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/02/16/demystifying-targeted-malware-used-polish-banks/)\nFebruary 2017, they made use of Enigma Protector and some of the Operation Blockbuster\n[samples, reported by Palo Alto Networks, used an older version of VMProtect.](https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2017/08/unit42-blockbuster-saga-continues/)\n\n## Common Lazarus format strings\n\nAmong numerous typical characteristics that let us attribute the samples and attacks to\nLazarus, one worth pointing out for the sake of other researchers is format strings. The\ntable below lists formatting strings found in the aforementioned samples, as well as in many\nTCP backdoors linked with Lazarus:\n\n**Format String** **Lazarus Attack / Report**\n\n\ncmd.exe /c \"%s 2>> %s\"\n\ncmd.exe /c \"%s >> %s 2>&1\"\n\n\nThis case - online casino in\nCentral America\n\n\ncm%sx%s\"%s%s %s\" 2>%s Operation Blockbuster &\n\nWannaCryptor outbreak\n\n\nc%s.e%sc \"%s > %s 2>&1\"\n\n%sd.e%sc \"%s > %s 2>&1\"\n\n%s%s%s \"%s > %s 2>&1\"\n\nmd.e\n\nxe /c\n\n%sd.e%sc \"%s > %s\" 2>&1\n\n%sd.e%sc n%ssh%srewa%s ad%s po%sop%sing\nT%s %d \"%s\"\n\n\nOperation Blockbuster - The\nSequel\n\nOperation Blockbuster - The Saga\n\nOperation Blockbuster\n\n\n%s /c \"%s\" >%s 2>&1 Operation Blockbuster\n\ncmd.exe /c \"%s\" > %s 2>&1 The Polish and Mexican case\n\nBy itself, this might not seem to be a convincing clue, but checking these format strings\nagainst all the malware samples ever collected by ESET, the only results are from samples\nin suspected Lazarus operations. Hence, we conclude that these format strings represent a\nrelevant, static characteristic of the Lazarus Group’s modus operandi.\n\n## Additional tools\n\nThere are (at least) two widely available tools that the attackers in the online casino case\nalso used.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Browser Password Dump\n\nThis shady tool serves the purpose of recovering passwords from popular web browsers.\nHowever, it is a tool from December 2014, which uses old, well-known techniques.\nNevertheless, it can be used effectively on the current, latest versions of Google Chrome\n(64.0.3282.186), Chromium (67.0.3364.0), Microsoft Edge (41.16299.15.0) and Microsoft\nInternet Explorer (11.0.9600.17843). It does not work against recent versions of Firefox or\nOpera.\n\n## Mimikatz\n\nThese attackers also used a modified version of the infamous open-source tool Mimikatz,\nwhich is used for extracting Windows credentials. It accepts one parameter – the name of\nthe file in which to store the output. If no parameter is given then the output file is called\n~Temp1212.tmp located in the same directory as Mimikatz. The output contains hashes of\nthe Windows credentials of currently logged-in users. This tool is commonly used by various\n[APT groups and cybercriminals, for example by the Telebots group in the massive](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/06/30/telebots-back-supply-chain-attacks-against-ukraine/)\nDiskCoder.C (aka [NotPetya) outbreak, or in](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/06/27/new-ransomware-attack-hits-ukraine/) [Operation Buhtrap.](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2015/04/09/operation-buhtrap/)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Infection vector\n\nMost of the tools described above are downloaded and installed onto victim systems by\nmalicious droppers and loaders active in the initial stage of the attack. Moreover, we have\n[seen indicators that the attackers leveraged remote access tools, such as Radmin 3 and](https://www.radmin.com/)\n[LogMeIn, in order to control machines remotely.](https://www.logmein.com/)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis recent attack against an online casino in Central America suggests that hacking tools\nfrom the Lazarus toolset are recompiled with every attack (we didn’t see these exact\nsamples anywhere else). The attack itself was very complex, consisted of several steps,\nand involved tens of protected tools that, being stand-alone, would reveal little from their\ndynamics.\n\nUtilizing KillDisk in the attack scenario most likely served one of two purposes: the attackers\ncovering their tracks after an espionage operation, or it was used directly for extortion or\ncyber-sabotage. In any case, the fact that ESET products detected the malware on over\n100 endpoints and servers in the organization signifies a large-scale effort of the attackers.\n\n[Special thanks to Dávid Gábriš and Robert Lipovský.](https://www.welivesecurity.com/author/lipovsky/)\n\nImage Credit: © [Julliane Nova](https://julliane.deviantart.com/)\n\n**SAMPLES**\n\n\n-----\n\n**SAMPLES**\n\n429B750D7B1E3B8DFC2264B8143E97E5C32803FF Win32/KillDisk.NBO\n\n7DFE5F779E46855B32612D168B9CC5334F25B5F6 Win32/KillDisk.NBO\n\n5042C16076AE6346AF8CF2B40553EEEEA98D5321 Win64/NukeSped.W trojan\n\n(VMProtect-ed)\n\n7C55572E8573D08F3A69FB15B7FEF10DF1A8CB33 Win64/NukeSped.W trojan\n\n(Themida-protected)\n\nE7FDEAB60AA4203EA0FF24506B3FC666FBFF759F Win64/NukeSped.Z trojan\n\n(Themida-protected)\n\n18EA298684308E50E3AE6BB66D7321A5CE664C8E Win64/NukeSped.Z trojan\n\n(VMProtect-ed)\n\n8826D4EDBB00F0A45C23567B16BEED2CE18B1B6A Win64/NukeSped.AB trojan\n\n(Themida-protected)\n\n325E27077B4A71E6946735D32224CA0421140EF4 Win64/Riskware.Mimikatz.A\n\napplication\n\nD39311C74DEB60C736982C1AB74D6684DD1E1264 Win32/SecurityXploded.T\n\n(VMProtect-ed)\n\nE4B763B4E74DE3EF24DB6F19108E70C494CD18C9 Win32/SecurityXploded.T\n\n(Themida-protected)\n\n3 Apr 2018 - 03:00PM\n\n### Sign up to receive an email update whenever a new article is published in our Ukraine Crisis – Digital Security Resource Center\n\n Newsletter\n\n Discussion\n\n\n-----",
