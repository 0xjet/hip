This story hints at the answers to two now pressing questions:**\n\n**_How can established ransomware collectives utilize subsidiary groupsfor_**\n**_operations involving data exfiltration without also utilizing extortion tactics?_**\n\n**_What will happen to ransomware groups after Conti’s final shutdown?_**\n\nAdvIntel already published primary research regarding these trends, centered around the\ncase study of KaraKurt, (Enter KaraKurt: Data Extortion Arm of Prolific Ransomware\n**_Group, published April 18). Since these findings became public, AdvIntel’s intelligence team_**\nhas assembled its newest findings into another case: an in-depth analysis of BlackByte, the\n**Conti affiliate which was created for the sole purpose of maximizing Conti’s monetary**\n**data extortion.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_The 49ers Security Incident_**\n\nPosted on the group’s “shame blog” in a file labeled “2020 Invoices”, BlackByte’s operatives\nadvertised 292 megabytes of what was allegedly stolen financial data belonging to the NFL\nteam for download, available free of charge. That same day, a statement issued by the 49ers\nteam alluded to a “network security incident”—one which had apparently disrupted corporate\nIT systems, but had not affected stadium operations or ticketholders (meaning that there may\nnot have been a network lock). The data being offered was not vital to the 49ers’ operations,\nbut rather a sample, perhaps representing an early step in what could become exponentially\nhigher stakes for the team later on.\n\n\n-----\n\n_[Screenshot of the BlackByte page advertising the stolen data. Source: BleepingComputer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/nfls-san-francisco-49ers-hit-by-blackbyte-ransomware-attack/)_\n\n**_Attack Anatomy: BlackByte, or Something More?_**\n\nMedia outlets were quick to speculate on the nature of the attack, noting that BlackByte,\n[although positioned with a number of successful ransomware attacks under their belt, was](https://www.ic3.gov/Media/News/2022/220211.pdf)\nstill relatively inactive and decentralized as a group. The breach was notable more so for\nwidespread name recognition in regards to its victim, and how it contributed to public\nanxieties for increasingly common large-scale and high-profile ransomware attacks. After all,\n\n\n-----\n\nthe incident raised reasonable questions both in and out of the cybersecurity world—How\nhad this smaller, newer, less-organized group of cybercriminals managed to orchestrate a\nmajor data theft from one of the [most valuable franchises of a multi-billion dollar association?](https://www.nfl.com/photos/the-most-valuable-nfl-franchises-according-to-forbes-0ap3000000530683)\n\n**The answer is that BlackByte, as a collective, does not exist, at least not**\n**autonomously. Instead, it’s a working part of something larger, and not only in the**\norganizational sense.\n\nAlmost exactly two months prior to this breach on December 14, 2021, AdvIntel published its\ndaily Breach Pulse report via our private security platform, Andariel. Breach Pulse is an\never-updating early alert deliverable sent by AdvIntel to customers and Law Enforcement,\n_intended to notify them when related companies and organizations have experienced a_\n_security breach. The digital newsletter contains both the names and small amounts of_\nbackground information about entities that have experienced a detected security exposure,\nas well as a full list of domains included in the detected compromise. The bulletin is intended\nfor clients so they can take preemptive action before a breach worsens, tightening their\n_defenses as needed and notifying relevant parties._\n\n**_On December 14, 2021,_** **_AdvIntel’s Breach Pulse reported a direct network security_**\n**_breach (via Cobalt Strike) of the San Francisco 49ers football team._**\n\n\n-----\n\n_Redacted screenshots from the 2021-12-14 Breach Pulse sent to AdvIntel clients, from the_\n**_Andariel Database. Identifying information of adjacent compromises has been redacted. A_**\n_full report, containing specific IOCs and details about the scale of compromise is available_\n_[per request via support@advintel.tech.](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:support@advintel.tech)_\n\n**The attack developed through the following set of Cobalt Strike commands on the**\n**targeted 49ers host (the following actual executed commands are listed in chronological**\norder of execution during this incident).\n\nWith the use of Cobalt Strike, the Conti team who began the operation against the 49ers on\nDecember 14 were able to compromise the victim’s primary domain and get access to the\n_local shares and core network segments for several departments, including the team’s_\n\n\n-----\n\n_finance and accounting sectors. Using its unique adversarial insight, AdvIntel was not only_\n**able to spot the initial compromise by finding the Cobalt Strike intrusion but also**\n**identified the actor behind the attack (the likely Patient Zero), as well as the scale of**\n**the initial intrusion.**\n\nIt should be noted that Conti’s presence in the network shares enabled them to map internal\nfolders and identify critical information which could be then handled by other groups for\nexfiltration and data encryption. In this case, Conti used a Cobalt Strike beacon to move\n_laterally through a network silently in order to investigate it and map it to full capacity, rather_\nthan hit it directly.\n\n_AdvIntel identified at least 14 domain admins that were targeted. Several of the network_\n_shares accessed are shown in the above image, such as Accounting, Finance, and_\n**_Compensation Plans, along with numerous others, including:_**\n\nCompliance Management\n\n\n-----\n\nCorporate Partnerships\n\nEngineeringOps\n\nEquipment\n\nHuman Resources\n\nIT\n\nLegal\n\nPayroll-grp\n\nRecords Management\n\nSales\n\n_This reconnaissance and initial mapping operation is the most fundamental stage in any_\n_ransomware attack. If Conti’s presence had been addressed when it was reported in_\nDecember, the recent incident involving the 49ers would most likely never have taken place.\n\n**_Cut Off the Head & the Body Survives_**\n\nAdvIntel’s credible primary source confirmed that Conti was the true architect of the 49ers\nbreach. So how did BlackByte get their hands on the data?\n\nThe BlackByte-Conti liaison is more than just an organizational nuance—it is a use case for\na much bigger trend sweeping the threat landscape: that of ransomware groups creating\n_sub-divisions that are aimed exclusively at data exfiltration, without any encryption involved._\n\n\n-----\n\n_[From the FBI’s recent report on BlackByte. [Source]](https://www.ic3.gov/Media/News/2022/220211.pdf)_\n\nThe Conti syndicate is not what it was at the beginning of this year. The group, which has\nuntil recently been the largest and most enduring ransomware organization to continue well\ninto 2022 (with REvil being dissolved at the top of the new year), is quickly shattering.\n\n_Since 2021, AdvIntel has observed Conti creating multiple alliances with other ransomware_\n_groups. These dynamics accelerated Conti’s increasing disintegration, but at the same time_\n_enabled innovations to develop. One of the main innovations was the data exfiltration without_\n_encryption - tactics used by BlackByte in the 49ers case._\n\n\n-----\n\nIn November 2021, AdvIntel reported on Andariel that Conti had formed an alliance with\nfellow ransomware group HIVEwhile simultaneously attempting to negotiate similar\nagreements with both BlackCat and HelloKitty. Like a true criminal syndicate, Conti was\nfolding into smaller gangs for peripheral operations to outsource some of its “dirty work”, and\nby December, Conti and HIVE had infiltrated the networks of an area of over 500,000 in\nSouthern Italy.\n\nAt first glance, this may appear to cast a shadow of doubt on the notion of future\nransomware subsidiaries (AdvIntel has assessed that the reasoning behind the succession\n_of splits was due to the sanctions involved in belonging to a powerful and well-established_\n_syndicate) however, it is possible that this turn of events is instead illuminating the path to_\nransomware’s next evolution—one where fledgling subsidiary groups are poised to become\ncybercrime’s next major syndicates.\n\nBy handing over external commands on some of their smaller projects, Conti has, until\nrecently, been able to harness a far greater breadth of control while still ensuring financial\ngain from all of their targets, in addition to protecting themselves from business interruptions\nin the case of unforeseen circumstances, such as server failure.\n\n_AdvIntel has identified networks initially accessed by Conti on HIVE’s admin panel, listed as_\n_active targets._\n\n\n-----\n\nBy the beginning of 2022, the group s reliance on external brands for operations had begun\nto internalize: Instead of “networking”, trying to build solid business connections within the\nchaotic and perpetually shifting ecosystem of ransomware groups, Conti began to delegate\nfrom within, spawning in-house subgroups specifically designed for data exfiltration. This\nmethod was what eventually led to the creation of BlackByte, as well as a second case study\nfor Conti’s expansion, Karakurt.\n\n_[Karakurt emerged in December 2021 and quickly amassed records of over forty victims,](https://threatpost.com/extortion-karakurt-threat-ransomware/176911/)_\nbecoming known for the rapacity with which it moved from target to target. In 2022, AdvIntel\npublished a customer deliverable revealing that Karakurt had been supplied with both\n_network access and intelligence information prior to their credited compromises by none_\nother than Conti themselves. This was done in order to delegate Karakurt with cases in\nwhich data theft had to be performed, but not data encryption. The reasons for this decision\nare embedded in the inherent challenges of the locker-centric model, which have been\n[explored by AdvIntel in its public blog post, which details the Karakurt-Conti symbiosis as](https://www.advintel.io/post/enter-karakurt-data-extortion-arm-of-prolific-ransomware-group)\nwell as gives further context into the history and psychology of Conti’s various business\nventures.\n\nWhat is essential to note in the breach of the San Francisco 49ers is that Conti had already\n_meticulously mapped the network environment prior to the data theft before handing off the_\nfinal processes of the operation to BlackByte.\n\nAs relatively small and decentralized collectives that have rarely participated in large-scale\nattacks, it makes little sense for groups such as Karakurt or BlackByte to emerge alone,\nseemingly fully formed, from the ether of the criminal underground as a new wave of\nexpansionist cyber-predators. Without Conti’s interventionism at the head of a widespread\nrealm of ransomware operations, the logic of smaller, independent groups like BlackByte as\nlone actors begins to fall apart.\n\n**CONCLUSIONS**\n\n_What does this all mean for the future of the threat landscape?_\n\n\n-----\n\nAlthough we can only speculate for now, the diversification of Conti s criminal portfolio paired\nwith its shockingly swift dissolution does bring into question whether their business model will\nbe repeated among other groups.\n\nAlthough not a ransomware-focused threat group, the well-known adversarial collective\n**TrickBot did directly lead to the creation of Conti. Specifically, it was their “Overdose”**\ndivision that helped to spawn the threat group Ryuk, which later rebranded as Conti. Conti\ncontinued to grow on its own until, in a reversal of its original dynamic with TrickBot, the\nsyndicate essentially absorbed it into its own operations, turning TrickBot into a Conti\nsubsidiary itself.\n\n**This is a strong candidate for the projected future of ransomware groups: As groups**\ngrow in size and scope, they will begin to spawn business derivatives to handle some of their\nsmaller operations in return for assistance and resources. This, in turn, will allow those\nsubgroups to grow independently of the larger group, before extenuating circumstances,\nsuch as sanctions, struggles for power, or impending dissolution of the parent collective\neventually lead that subgroup to split off and become their own threat entity. Using this\nmethodology, affiliates will have more direct pathways to find future groups as their current\naffiliation begins to die—and then the cycle begins again.\n\nAs it stands, BlackByte is already coming into their own as an independent group, spurred on\nby Conti’s sudden fall from power. Only time will tell if they can someday grow into the space\n_left by the cybercriminal giant._\n\n**Recommendations & Mitigations**\n\nBlackByte is a data-stealing venture. Most mitigations should be directed at the\ndetection of abnormal network presence.\n\nSpecial emphasis should be placed on network investigation tools typical for Conti’s\nsub-divisions such as BlackByte, Black Basta, and Karakurt. These tools include:\n**Cobalt Strike sessions opened, Metasploit, and customized PowerShell**\n**commands since all these tools are ubiquitous for Conti attacks.**\n\n**Rclone is the main data exfiltration command-line interface. Rclone activity can be**\ncaptured through proper logging of process execution with command-line arguments.\n\n\n-----\n\n[For AdvIntel Customers]: Rclone commands can be tracked via the Andariel Cobalt\n**Strike index.**\n\n[For AdvIntel Customers]: Detailed instructions on how to search for data exfiltration\ncommands can be found in AdvIntel’s [Andariel Cookbook] Tracking Adversarial\n**_Data Exfiltration Attempts Using Andariel’s “Cobalt Strike Ransomware Breach_**\n**_Logs”_**\n\nAction and monitoring for network segmentation, network hierarchy, and abnormal innetwork behavior. BlackByte focuses on extensive lateral movement to be able to find\nthe most important shares containing data.\n\n_In addition to AdvIntel mitigations, the FBI has also published several recommended_\n_mitigations in regards to BlackByte. These mitigations include the following:_\n\nImplement regular backups of all data to be stored as air-gapped, passwordprotected copies offline. Ensure these copies are not accessible for modification or\ndeletion from any system where the original data resides.\n\nInstall and regularly update antivirus software on all hosts, and enable real-time\n**detection.**\n\nInstall updates/patch operating systems, software, and firmware as soon as\nupdates/patches are released.\n\n**Review domain controllers, servers, workstations, and active directories for new**\nor unrecognized user accounts.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Audit user accounts with administrative privileges and configure access controls**\nwith least privilege in mind. Do not give all users administrative privileges.\n\n**Disable unused remote access/Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) ports and monitor**\nremote access/RDP logs for any unusual activity.\n\nConsider adding an email banner to emails received from outside your organization.\n\n**Disable hyperlinks in received emails.**\n\nUse double authentication when logging into accounts or services.\n\nEnsure routine auditing is conducted for all accounts.\n\n**Ensure all the identified IOCs are input into the network SIEM for continuous**\nmonitoring and alerts.\n\n**Adversarial Assessment Summary [BlackByte]**\n\n**BlackByte [Threat Group]**\n\nMalware Type: Ransomware\n\nOrigin: Eastern Europe\n\nIntelligence Source: High Confidence\n\nFunctionality:\n\nData encryption\n\nData exfiltration\n\nBackup removal\n\nUtilization of legitimate software agents\n\nMITRE ATT&CK Framework:\n\nT1486 - Data Encrypted for Impact\n\nT1068 - Exploitation for Privilege Escalation\n\nT1083 - File and Directory Discovery\n\nT1140 - Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information\n\n\n-----\n\nT1489 - Service Stop\n\nDistribution:\n\nMicrosoft Exchange Server CVE\n\nCobalt Strike\n\nPowerShell\n\nPersistency: Very High\n\nInfection Rate: High\n\nDecrypter: Not Released\n\n**_Threat Assessment: Critical_**\n\nBlackByte is a Ransomware as a Service (RaaS) group that encrypts files on compromised\nWindows host systems, including physical and virtual servers.
