CrowdStrike noted that two big game hunting (BGH) adversaries, CARBON SPIDER](https://adversary.crowdstrike.com/en-US/adversary/carbon-spider/)\nand SPRITE SPIDER, were observed utilizing this technique with their respective\nransomware variants, Darkside and Defray777. Since then, CrowdStrike has observed a\n[significant uptrend in hypervisor jackpotting by other adversaries, including PINCHY SPIDER](https://adversary.crowdstrike.com/en-US/adversary/pinchy-spider/)\n\n\n-----\n\nand VIKING SPIDER. In this blog, we overview each new campaign CrowdStrike has\nobserved targeting ESXi systems and detail defensive controls that can be implemented to\nprotect these critical assets.\n\n## Babuk Locker\n\nIn March 2021, operators of Babuk Locker ransomware offered access to an ESXi variant as\npart of a sought-out partnership opportunity. In May 2021, CrowdStrike Services observed a\nvictim targeted with this ESXi variant. The ransomware appends the file extension\n```\n.babyk_esxi to files it encrypts, and creates a ransom note named How To Restore\nYour Files.txt . The ransom note contains two URLs: a victim-specific .onion URL for\n\n```\ncommunications, and one for the Babuk Locker dedicated leak site (DLS).\n\n## FERAL SPIDER and DeathKitty\n\nSince March 2021, FERAL SPIDER, the developers and operators of DeathKitty (aka\n_HelloKitty) ransomware added functionality to terminate and encrypt virtual machines running_\non a VMware ESXi hypervisor. If VMware ESXi targeting is enabled ( -e option), the\nransomware will only encrypt file extensions related to disk volumes and snapshots: . vmdk,\n```\n.vmsd and .vmsn . When executed with the -k argument, the ransomware will terminate\n\n```\nall running virtual machines using VMware ESXi’s command-line administration utility\n( esxcli ) prior to beginning the encryption process.\n\n## CYBORG SPIDER and Pysa\n\nSince May 2021, CYBORG SPIDER, the developers and operators of Pysa ransomware,\nhave targeted ESXi servers for encryption. After compromising an environment, CYBORG\nSPIDER operators move laterally to the hypervisors via HTTPS using the native ESXi root\naccount, where they enable SSH for a remote shell. The operators then use PuTTY and\nWinSCP to copy the ransomware to the `/tmp directory and execute the commands shown`\nin Table 1.\n\n**Command** **Description**\n\n`python --version` Check version of Python installed\n\n`cd /tmp/` Change to /tmp/ directory\n\n`chmod +x <FILENAME>` Add execute permission to Pysa script\n\n`./<FILENAME> /vmfs/volumes 4096` Execute Pysa against the VM datastore path\n\nTable 1. Pysa commands\n\n\n-----\n\nCrowdStrike observed multiple cases in which the Pysa ransomware script was tailored for\nthe version of Python installed on the ESXi, with Pysa filenames `27 and` `3 noted as highly`\nlikely to correspond with Python v2.7 or v3.x. The ransomware also appends the file\nextension `.pysa to files it encrypts, and creates a ransom note named`\n```\nRECOVER_YOUR_DATA.txt at the root ( / ) of the volume. The ransom note provides two\n\n```\nemail addresses, hosted on OnionMail and ProtonMail, for communications and includes\n_Pysa’s DLS .onion domain._\n\n## PINCHY SPIDER and REvix\n\nSince June 2021, PINCHY SPIDER has distributed a Linux ransomware variant named\n_REvix to target ESXi systems. The ELF binary uses the same encryption algorithm as_\nPINCHY SPIDER’s Windows REvil ransomware. The ransomware contains a JSON\nconfiguration block that specifies the ransom note filename and encrypted file extension to\nuse. For example, in a sample of REvix v1.1c, the ransomware was configured to append\nthe file extension `.rhkrc to encrypted files, and use the name` `rhkrc-readme.txt as the`\nransom note. By default, the ransomware will encrypt only the current directory and requires\nthe `--path option to specify the target folder (e.g.,` `/vmfs/ ), which is then recursively`\nenumerated. Prior to encryption, the ransomware executes the commands shown in Table 2.\n\n**Command** **Description**\n\n`pkill -9 vmx-*` Terminate any processes\nnamed vmx-*\n\n```\n esxcli --formatter=csv --format param=fields==\"WorldID,DisplayName\" vm process\n list | awk -F \"\\\"*,\\\"*\" {system(\"esxcli vm\n process kill --type=force --world-id=\" $1)}\n\n```\nTable 2. REvix commands\n\n\nList the running VMs on this\nsystem and force terminate\neach VM based on the\nenumerated list of World IDs\n\n\nIn July 2021, PINCHY SPIDER began distributing REvix v1.2a, which added execution of VM\ntermination functionality within a separate thread, and support for additional encryption types.\nIn mid-July 2021, PINCHY SPIDER’s DLS infrastructure went offline, leaving in question the\nfuture of these operations.\n\n## VIKING SPIDER and Ragnar Locker\n\nSince June 2021, VIKING SPIDER has deployed Ragnar Locker’s ELF binary to ESXi\nsystems via SSH using the native root account. VIKING SPIDER copies the binary to the\n```\n/tmp directory and issues the commands shown in Table 3.\n\n```\n**Command** **Description**\n\n\n-----\n\n`uname -a` Print all system information\n\n`esxcli system version get` Display the product name, version and build\ninformation\n\n`esxcli system hostname get` Display the fully qualified hostname of the ESXi host\n\n`esxcli system account list` List local user accounts\n\n```\nesxcli --formatter=csv vm\nprocess list\nesxcli vm process kill -w\n<WID> -t soft\n\n```\ne sxcli --formatter=csv vm\n```\nprocess list\nfind /vmfs/volumes/ -type f\n-name \"*.vmdk\"\n\n```\n\nList the running VMs on this system\n\nPerform a “soft” kill (clean shutdown) of the VM\nassociated with the given World ID\nThis command is repeated for each running VM to kill\n\nList the running VMs on this system (again) to confirm\nthey are all shutdown\n\nSearch for all virtual disk files within the VM datastore\npath\n\n\n`chmod a+x /tmp/<FILENAME>` Add execute permission to Ragnar Locker binary\n\n```\n/tmp/<FILENAME>\n/vmfs/volumes/<UUID>/\n\n```\n\nExecute Ragnar Locker against the VM datastore\npath\n\n\n`ps | grep <FILENAME>` Ensure Ragnar Locker process is running\n\nTable 3. Ragnar Locker commands\n\nThe ransomware appends the file extension `.crypted to files it encrypts, and creates a`\nransom note per encrypted file using the original filename appended with the extension\n```\n.crypted.README_TO_RESTORE . The ransom note includes a unique victim URL for live\n\n```\nchat communications via Tor, as well as VIKING SPIDER’s dedicated leak site (DLS) .onion\ndomain.\n\n## How to Protect Your Cluster\n\nListed below are CrowdStrike’s top five recommendations that organizations should\nimplement to mitigate the success or impact of hypervisor jackpotting.\n\n**Avoid direct access to ESXi hosts. Use the vSphere Client to administer ESXi hosts**\nthat are managed by a vCenter Server. Do not access managed hosts directly with the\nVMware Host Client, and do not change managed hosts from the Direct Console User\nInterface (DCUI). (Note: This is a VMware-specific recommendation.)\n\n\n-----\n\n**If direct access to an ESXi host is necessary, use a hardened jump server with**\n**multifactor authentication. ESXi DCUI access should be limited to a jump server**\nused for only administrative or privileged purposes with full auditing capabilities and\nmultifactor authentication (MFA) enabled.\n**Ensure vCenter is not exposed to the internet over SSH or HTTP. CrowdStrike has**\nobserved adversaries gaining initial access to vCenter using valid accounts or\nexploiting remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities (e.g., CVE-2021-21985).\nAlthough these vulnerabilities have been addressed by VMware, these services should\nnot be exposed to the internet to mitigate risk.\n**Ensure ESXi datastore volumes are regularly backed up. Specifically, virtual**\nmachine disk images and snapshots should be backed up daily (more frequently if\npossible) to an offsite storage provider.\n**If encryption activity is observed, do not shut down the ESXi hosts. If encryption**\nactivity is observed, system administrators may be tempted to reboot or shutdown\nVMs. Be aware that [ransomware is not able to modify locked files, and if a VM is still](https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/ransomware/)\npowered on, it will be considered locked. As a result, shutting down or rebooting VMs\nwill actually release the lock and allow the ransomware to encrypt the virtual disk files.\n\n[Additional ESXi security recommendations are available from VMware at](https://www.vmware.com/)\nhttps://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/com.vmware.vsphere.security.doc/GUIDB39474AF-6778-499A-B8AB-E973BE6D4899.html.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCrowdStrike has observed a significant uptrend in eCrime campaigns targeting VMware\nESXi hypervisors with ransomware to maximize encryption impact across a victim\nenvironment. This targeting modus operandi is becoming prevalent, with adversaries\ndeveloping and deploying ESXi ransomware variants, and in some cases seeking\npartnership opportunities with other operators or access brokers.\n\nCrowdStrike recommends that organizations review their ESXi security posture and\nimplement the specific defensive controls outlined in this blog to protect these critical assets.\n\n**Additional Resources**\n\n_To learn more about eCrime adversaries tracked by CrowdStrike Intelligence, visit the_\n_[CrowdStrike Adversary Universe.](https://adversary.crowdstrike.com/)_\n_To find out how to incorporate intelligence on threat actors into your security strategy,_\n_visit the_ _[Falcon X™ Threat Intelligence page.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/endpoint-security-products/falcon-x-threat-intelligence/)_\n_Learn about the powerful, cloud-native CrowdStrike Falcon® platform by visiting the_\n_product webpage._\n_[Get a full-featured free trial of CrowdStrike Falcon Prevent™ to see for yourself how](https://go.crowdstrike.com/try-falcon-prevent.html)_\n_true next-gen AV performs against today’s most sophisticated threats._\n\n\n-----",
