The adversary group\nresponsible for the campaign, which we named “Lotus Blossom,” is well organized and likely\nstate-sponsored, with support from a country that has interests in Southeast Asia. The\ncampaign has been in operation for some time; we have identified over 50 different attacks\ntaking place over the past three years.\n\n## Background and Findings\n\nUnit 42 has linked more than 50 individual attacks across Hong Kong, Taiwan, Vietnam, the\nPhilippines, and Indonesia to the Lotus Blossom group. These attacks share a number of\ncharacteristics, including:\n\nThey are against military and government targets\nSpearphishing is used as the initial attack vector\nThey use a custom Trojan backdoor named “Elise” to gain a foothold\nA decoy file appears during initial compromise with Elise, tricking users into thinking\nthey opened a benign file\n\nAttacks by the Lotus Blossom group rely heavily on the use of spearphishing emails that use\nenticing subject lines and legitimate-looking decoy documents to trick users into opening a\nmalware executable they think is a legitimate document. This document is usually a\npersonnel roster for a specific military or government office.\n\nWe believe that the Lotus Blossom group developed the Elise malware specifically to meet\nthe needs of the attack campaigns, and we’ve observed three variants across 50 samples\nduring the three-year period of these attacks. Elise is a relatively sophisticated tool, including\n\n\n-----\n\nvariants with the ability to evade detection in virtual environments, connect to command-andcontrol servers for additional instruction, and exfiltrate data.\n\nOperation Lotus Blossom is a prime example of how a well-resourced adversary will deploy\nadvanced tools, over an extended time period, sometimes years, in order to reach its goals.\nIn this case, the pattern of behavior suggests that the actors behind this group were nationstate sponsored, from a country with an interest in the government and military affairs of\nSoutheast Asian nations.\n\n[Unit 42 discovered this attack using the Palo Alto Networks AutoFocus service, which allows](http://media.paloaltonetworks.com/lp/autofocus/)\n[analysts to quickly find correlations among malware samples analyzed by WildFire. Palo Alto](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/technologies/wildfire.html)\n[Networks customers are protected from the malware used in Operation Lotus Blossom via](https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.PaloAlto-LotusBlossom)\nWildFire and our Security Platform’s [Threat Prevention capabilities (IPS signature 14358).](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/solutions/initiative/threat-prevention.html)\n\nWe recommend that other security practitioners review the Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)\nin the full report to ensure they have not been targets in this campaign, and add the\nappropriate security controls to prevent future attacks.\n\n[The full report on Lotus Blossom from Unit 42 can be downloaded here, which includes all](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/resources/research/unit42-operation-lotus-blossom.html)\nIOCs.
