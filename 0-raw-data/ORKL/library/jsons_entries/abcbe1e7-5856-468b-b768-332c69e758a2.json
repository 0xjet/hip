Without properly\nconfigured DMARC policies, malicious cyber actors are able to send spoofed emails as if they came\nfrom a legitimate domain’s email exchange.\n\nThe North Korean cyber actors have conducted spearphishing campaigns posing as legitimate\njournalists, academics, or other experts in East Asian affairs with credible links to North Korean\npolicy circles. North Korea leverages these spearphishing campaigns to collect intelligence on\ngeopolitical events, adversary foreign policy strategies, and any information affecting North Korean\ninterests by gaining illicit access to targets’ private documents, research, and communications.\n\nThis Joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) includes indicators of North Korean social engineering\n(page 4) for potential victims receiving spearphishing emails as well as mitigation measures (page 9)\nfor organizations who could be victims of North Korean impersonation.

The United States Government (USG) has observed sustained information-gathering\nefforts originating from North Korean cyber actors. North Korea’s premier military intelligence\norganization, the Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB), which has been sanctioned by the United\nNations Security Council, is primarily responsible for this network of actors and activities. The\nauthoring agencies of this advisory assess the principal goals of North Korea’s regime cyber program\ninclude maintaining consistent access to current intelligence about the United States, South Korea,\nand other countries of interest to impede any perceived political, military, or economic threat to the\nregime’s security and stability.\n\nThe USG and private sector cybersecurity companies currently track the specific set of North Korean\ncyber actors conducting these large-scale social engineering campaigns as Kimsuky, Emerald Sleet,\nAPT43, Velvet Chollima, and Black Banshee (herein referred to as Kimsuky). Kimsuky is\nadministratively subordinate to the 63[rd ]Research Center, an element within North Korea’s RGB, and\nhas conducted broad cyber campaigns in support of RGB objectives since at least 2012. Kimsuky\nactors’ primary mission is to provide stolen data and valuable geopolitical insight to the North Korean\nregime by compromising policy analysts and other experts. Successful compromises further enable\nKimsuky actors to craft more credible and effective spearphishing emails, which can then be\nleveraged against more sensitive, higher-value targets.\n\nThe authoring agencies seek to bring awareness of these campaigns to degrade or minimize the\neffectiveness of Kimsuky spearphishing operations. This advisory provides detailed information on\nhow Kimsuky actors exploit DMARC policies; red flags to consider when encountering common\nthemes and campaigns; and general mitigation measures for entities worldwide to implement to\nbetter protect against Kimsuky’s computer network exploitation (CNE) operations.\n\n## KIMSUKY’S OPERATIONS: DMARC POLICY NOT ENABLED\n\nDMARC is an email security protocol that authenticates whether an email message seemingly sent\nfrom an organization’s domain was legitimately sent from that organization’s domain. A DMARC\npolicy can be configured and applied to a domain to specify actions to be taken when email\nauthentication fails. When an organization securely configures a DMARC policy, it helps ensure\nmalicious actors, like Kimsuky, are unable to spoof the organization’s legitimate email domain when\nsending spearphishing messages to a target. A DMARC policy tells a receiving email server what to\ndo with the email after checking a domain’s Sender Policy Framework (SPF) and DomainKeys\nIdentified Mail (DKIM) records. Depending on if an email passes or fails SPF and DKIM, the email\ncan be marked as spam, blocked, or delivered to an intended recipient’s inbox.[1]\n\n1 SPF and DKIM are additional email authentication methods that separately provide layers of security on which\nDMARC protocols also rely. Together, DMARC, DKIM, and SPF function like a background check on email\nsenders, to make sure they really are who they appear to be. Email servers can mark emails as spam if there is\nno DMARC record, but DMARC provides clearer instructions on when to do so.\n\n\nFBI | State | NSA\n**TLP:CLEAR**\n\n\n-----\n\nFBI | State | NSA\n**TLP:CLEAR**\n\nNorth Korean cyber actors rely on social engineering techniques such as spearphishing—the use of\nfabricated emails tailored to deceive a target—as their primary vector for initiating a compromise and\ngaining access to a target’s device and networks. Kimsuky spearphishing campaigns begin with\nbroad research and preparation, including leveraging open source information to identify potential\ntargets of value and then creating tailored online personas to appear more realistic and appealing to\ntheir targets. The cyber actors may also use content from emails of previously compromised email\naccounts to enhance the seeming authenticity of their spoofed emails.\n\nIn addition to convincing email messages, Kimsuky cyber actors have been observed creating fake\nusernames and using legitimate domain names to impersonate individuals from trusted organizations,\nincluding think tanks and higher education institutions, to gain trust and build rapport with email\nrecipients. Spoofed emails do not come from the trusted organization’s actual domain email\nexchange, but rather from the actor-controlled email address and domain. Even if a skeptical recipient\nwanted to verify whether the sender was legitimate, the recipient email response would be sent back\nto a spoofed email address at the trusted domain. The ‘reply-to’ section of the email header would\nreveal the North Korean actor-controlled email address and domain, but it would still appear to be\nlegitimate.\n\nThe sample emails beginning on page 5 are real unedited examples of Kimsuky spearphishing\nattempts reported to the USG and contain spelling and other errors. The email headers of each\nsample are real excerpts that illustrate how technical analysis can be conducted. The names of\nindividuals and impacted entities have been redacted.\n\n\nFBI | State | NSA\n**TLP:CLEAR**\n\n\nIf you believe you have been targeted in one of these spearphishing campaigns, whether or\nnot it resulted in a compromise (particularly if you are a member of one of the targeted\n[sectors), please file a report with www.ic3.gov and reference #KimsukyCSA in the incident](http://www.ic3.gov/)\ndescription.\n\nPlease include as much detail as you can about the incident including the sender email\naddress and the text of the email message, specifying and links/URLs/domains. Please\nspecify whether you responded to the email, clicked on any links, or opened any\nattachments. Please retain the original email and attachments in case you are contacted by\nan investigator for further information.\n\n  - Please visit [www.ic3.gov](http://www.ic3.gov/) and use #KimsukyCSA in your submission.\n\n  - The U.S. Government also encourages victims to report suspicious activities,\nincluding any suspected North Korean cyber activities, to local FBI field offices.\n\n\n-----\n\nFBI | State | NSA\n**TLP:CLEAR**\n\n## RED FLAG INDICATORS\n\nSector targets should be aware of the following activity that may be indications or behaviors of\nmalicious North Korean cyber actors:\n\n     - Innocuous initial communication with no malicious links/attachments, followed by\ncommunications containing malicious links/documents, potentially from a different, seemingly\nlegitimate, email address\n\n     - Email content that may include real text of messages recovered from previous victim\nengagement with other legitimate contacts\n\n     - Emails in English that have awkward sentence structure and/or incorrect grammar\n\n     - Emails or communications targeting victims with either direct or indirect knowledge of policy\ninformation, including U.S. and ROK government employees/officials working on North Korea,\nAsia, China, and/or Southeast Asia matters; U.S. and ROK government employees with high\nclearance levels; and members of the military\n\n     - Email accounts that are spoofed with subtle incorrect misspellings of legitimate names and\nemail addresses listed in a university directory or an official website\n\n     - Malicious documents that require the user to click “Enable Macros” to view the document\n\n     - Follow-up emails within 2-3 days of initial contact if the target does not respond to the initial\nspearphishing email\n\n     - Emails purporting to be from official sources but sent using unofficial email services,\nidentifiable through the email header information being a slightly incorrect version of\nan organization’s domain\n\n\nFBI | State | NSA\n**TLP:CLEAR**\n\n\n-----\n\nFBI | State | NSA\n**TLP:CLEAR**\n\n**Sample Email 1:**\n\nBetween late 2023 and early 2024, North Korean cyber actors sent the following email to USG\nofficials and others at international organizations. Notably, a speaker fee is offered to further entice\nthe recipient. The body of the text also contains basic errors.\n\n\nFBI | State | NSA\n**TLP:CLEAR**\n\n\nSubject: [Invitation] US Policy Toward North Korea Conference\n\n\n-----\n\nFBI | State | NSA\n**TLP:CLEAR**\n\n**Sample Email Header 1:**\n\nIn the sample email header below, all referenced portions are highlighted. The email returns a “pass”\nfor the corresponding SPF and DKIM checks, implying the North Korean actor was successful in\ngaining access to a university’s legitimate email client to send the email. The DMARC protocol returns\nas “fail” because the sender’s email domain—presented as the domain of the legitimate think tank—\ndiffers from the SPF and DKIM records identified as a <legitimate university email host domain>\nand <legitimate university email account>, respectively. The “p=NONE” indicates that a DMARC\npolicy was set in which no email filtering action is taken on the message, despite the failed DMARC\nverification. This ultimately allows the spearphishing email to be delivered to the victim’s inbox.\nAdditionally, the North Korean actor edited the “Reply-To” email to route replies back to another\nseemingly legitimate, but fraudulent, account controlled by the actor.\n\nWhile the sender of the email and the organization’s email domain appear to be legitimate, the North\nKorean cyber actor exploited the organization’s weak and overly permissive, rather than specifically\ndefined, DMARC policy that allowed the North Korean actor to obfuscate the true sender domain.\n\nARC-Authentication-Results: i=l; mx.google.com\n\n**dkim=pass header.i=<legitimate university email account> header.s=defauIt**\nheader.b=pUMk3rBI;\n\n**spf=pass (google.com: domain of <legitimate university email host domain>**\ndesignates <IP address associated with university email host domain> as\npermitted sender) smtp.mailfrom=<legitimate university email host domain>;\n\n**dmarc=fail (p=none sp=none dis=none ) header.from=<spoofed domain of think tank>**\n\n…\n\nReceived: from evanger8 by box2239.bluehost.com with local (Exim 4.96.2)\n\n[(envelope-from <evanger8@box2239.bluehost.com>) id lrKTlk-OOOEeX-36 for <expert’s](mailto:evanger8@box2239.bluehost.com)\n**receiving email>; Mon, 01 Jan 2024 18:40:37 -0700**\n\nTo: <expert’s receiving email>\n\nSubject: [Invitation]\n\nX-PHP-Script: <legitimate university email account>/move/send/fooe.php for 59.6.130.254,\n59.6.130.254 X-PHP-Originating-Script: 1171:mail.php\n\nMIME-Version: 1.0\n\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8 Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\n\nFrom: <email address of legitimate think tank>\n\nCc:\n\nReply-To: <name of legitimate think tank staff> <spoofed account of legitimate think tank staff>\n\n\nFBI | State | NSA\n**TLP:CLEAR**\n\n\n-----\n\nFBI | State | NSA\n**TLP:CLEAR**\n\n**Sample Email 2:**\n\nIn November 2023, the authoring agencies received spearphishing reports of a North Korean cyber\nactor posing as a legitimate journalist and seeking comment from an expert on North Korea issues.\nImportantly, the North Korean actor openly notes they will not have access to the sending account\nand requests responses be sent to a fake personal account of the legitimate journalist. This novel\ntactic offers victims a plausible reason to respond to the alternative fake account.\n\n\nFBI | State | NSA\n**TLP:CLEAR**\n\n\n-----\n\nFBI | State | NSA\n**TLP:CLEAR**\n\n**Sample Email Header 2:**\n\nIn this case, the North Korean actor is able to exploit the absence of a DMARC policy that would have\nauthenticated the sending email address against the SPF check. The North Korean actor spoofed\nboth the name of a legitimate journalist and the real email domain of that journalist’s news media\noutlet as given in the “From” and “Sender” portions of the email’s header information. Similar to\nSample Email 1, the actor changed the “Reply-to” email address so that victim responses would be\nrouted to the account controlled by the North Korean actor.\n\n\nFBI | State | NSA\n**TLP:CLEAR**\n\n\n-----\n\nFBI | State | NSA\n**TLP:CLEAR**\n\n## MITIGATION MEASURES\n\nThe FBI, U.S. Department of State, and NSA recommend organizations implement the mitigations\nbelow to improve their cybersecurity posture of DMARC security policies. These mitigations align with\nthe Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs) developed by CISA and the National\nInstitute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The CPGs provide a minimum set of practices and\nprotections that CISA and NIST recommend all organizations implement. CISA and NIST based the\nCPGs on existing cybersecurity frameworks and guidance to protect against the most common and\nimpactful threats, tactics, techniques, and procedures. Visit CISA’s Cross-Sector Cybersecurity\nPerformance Goals for more information on the CPGs, including additional recommended baseline\nprotections. For email security specifically, CPG 2.M recommends enabling DMARC and setting it to\n“reject.”\n\nMissing DMARC policies or DMARC policies with “p=none” indicate that the receiving email server\nshould take no security action on emails that fail DMARC checks and allow the emails to be sent\nthrough to the recipient’s inbox. In order for organizations to make their policy stricter and signal to\nemail servers to consider unauthenticated emails as spam, the authoring agencies recommend\nmitigating this threat by updating your organization’s DMARC policy to one of these two\nconfigurations:\n\n     - “v=DMARC1; p=quarantine;”\n\n“p=quarantine” indicates that email servers should quarantine emails that fail DMARC, considering\nthem to be probable spam.\n\n     - “v=DMARC1; p=reject;”\n\n“p=reject” instructs email servers to block emails that fail DMARC, considering them to be almost\ncertainly spam.\n\nIn addition to setting the “p” field in DMARC policy, the authoring agencies recommend organizations\nset other DMARC policy fields, such as “rua” to receive aggregate reports about the DMARC results\nfor email messages purportedly from the organization’s domain.\n\n## DISCLAIMER\n\nThe information in this report is being provided “as is” for informational purposes only.
