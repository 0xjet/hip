Working with U.S.\ngovernment partners, DHS and FBI identified Internet Protocol (IP) addresses and other\nindicators of compromise (IOCs) associated with two families of malware used by the North\nKorean government:\n\na remote access tool (RAT), commonly known as Joanap; and\na Server Message Block (SMB) worm, commonly known as Brambul.\n\nThe U.S. Government refers to malicious cyber activity by the North Korean government as\nHIDDEN COBRA. For more information on HIDDEN COBRA activity, visit https://www.uscert.gov/hiddencobra.\n\nFBI has high confidence that HIDDEN COBRA actors are using the IP addresses—listed in\nthis report’s IOC files—to maintain a presence on victims’ networks and enable network\nexploitation. DHS and FBI are distributing these IP addresses and other IOCs to enable\nnetwork defense and reduce exposure to any North Korean government malicious cyber\nactivity.\n\nThis alert also includes suggested response actions to the IOCs provided, recommended\nmitigation techniques, and information on how to report incidents. If users or administrators\ndetect activity associated with these malware families, they should immediately flag it, report\nit to the DHS National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) or the\nFBI Cyber Watch (CyWatch), and give it the highest priority for enhanced mitigation.\n\nSee the following links for a downloadable copy of IOCs:\n\n[IOCs (.csv)](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/publications/TA18-149A.CSV)\n[IOCs (.stix)](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/publications/TA18-149A.stix.xml)\n\nNCCIC conducted analysis on four malware samples and produced a Malware Analysis\nReport (MAR). MAR-10135536.3 – RAT/Worm examines the tactics, techniques, and\n[procedures observed in the malware. Visit MAR-10135536.3 – HIDDEN COBRA RAT/Worm](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/AR18-149A)\n\n\n-----\n\nfor the report and associated IOCs.\n\n## Description\n\nAccording to reporting of trusted third parties, HIDDEN COBRA actors have likely been using\nboth Joanap and Brambul malware since at least 2009 to target multiple victims globally and\nin the United States—including the media, aerospace, financial, and critical infrastructure\nsectors. Users and administrators should review the information related to Joanap and\n[Brambul from the Operation Blockbuster Destructive Malware Report [1] in conjunction with](https://www.operationblockbuster.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Operation-Blockbuster-Destructive-Malware-Report.pdf)\nthe IP addresses listed in the .csv and .stix files provided within this alert. Like many of the\nfamilies of malware used by HIDDEN COBRA actors, Joanap, Brambul, and other previously\nreported custom malware tools, may be found on compromised network nodes. Each\nmalware tool has different purposes and functionalities.\n\nJoanap malware is a fully functional RAT that is able to receive multiple commands, which\ncan be issued by HIDDEN COBRA actors remotely from a command and control server.\nJoanap typically infects a system as a file dropped by other HIDDEN COBRA malware,\nwhich users unknowingly downloaded either when they visit sites compromised by HIDDEN\nCOBRA actors, or when they open malicious email attachments.\n\nDuring analysis of the infrastructure used by Joanap malware, the U.S. Government\nidentified 87 compromised network nodes. The countries in which the infected IP addresses\nare registered are as follows:\n\n\nArgentina\nBelgium\nBrazil\nCambodia\nChina\nColombia\n\n\nEgypt\nIndia\nIran\nJordan\nPakistan\nSaudi Arabia\n\n\nSpain\nSri Lanka\nSweden\nTaiwan\nTunisia\n\n\nMalware often infects servers and systems without the knowledge of system users and\nowners. If the malware can establish persistence, it could move laterally through a victim’s\nnetwork and any connected networks to infect nodes beyond those identified in this alert.\n\nBrambul malware is a brute-force authentication worm that spreads through SMB shares.\nSMBs enable shared access to files between users on a network. Brambul malware typically\nspreads by using a list of hard-coded login credentials to launch a brute-force password\nattack against an SMB protocol for access to a victim’s networks.\n\n**Technical Details**\n\n**Joanap**\n\n\n-----\n\nJoanap is a two-stage malware used to establish peer-to-peer communications and to\nmanage botnets designed to enable other operations. Joanap malware provides HIDDEN\nCOBRA actors with the ability to exfiltrate data, drop and run secondary payloads, and\ninitialize proxy communications on a compromised Windows device. Other notable functions\ninclude\n\nfile management,\nprocess management,\ncreation and deletion of directories, and\nnode management.\n\nAnalysis indicates the malware encodes data using Rivest Cipher 4 encryption to protect its\ncommunication with HIDDEN COBRA actors. Once installed, the malware creates a log entry\nwithin the Windows System Directory in a file named mssscardprv.ax. HIDDEN COBRA\nactors use this file to capture and store victims’ information such as the host IP address, host\nname, and the current system time.\n\n**Brambul**\n\nBrambul malware is a malicious Windows 32-bit SMB worm that functions as a service\ndynamic link library file or a portable executable file often dropped and installed onto victims’\nnetworks by dropper malware. When executed, the malware attempts to establish contact\nwith victim systems and IP addresses on victims’ local subnets. If successful, the application\nattempts to gain unauthorized access via the SMB protocol (ports 139 and 445) by launching\nbrute-force password attacks using a list of embedded passwords. Additionally, the malware\ngenerates random IP addresses for further attacks.\n\nAnalysts suspect the malware targets insecure or unsecured user accounts and spreads\nthrough poorly secured network shares. Once the malware establishes unauthorized access\non the victim’s systems, it communicates information about victim’s systems to HIDDEN\nCOBRA actors using malicious email addresses. This information includes the IP address\nand host name—as well as the username and password—of each victim’s system. HIDDEN\nCOBRA actors can use this information to remotely access a compromised system via the\nSMB protocol.\n\nAnalysis of a newer variant of Brambul malware identified the following built-in functions for\nremote operations:\n\nharvesting system information,\naccepting command-line arguments,\ngenerating and executing a suicide script,\npropagating across the network using SMB,\nbrute forcing SMB login credentials, and\n\n\n-----\n\ngenerating Simple Mail Transport Protocol email messages containing target host\nsystem information.\n\n**Detection and Response**\n\nThis alert’s IOC files provide HIDDEN COBRA IOCs related to Joanap and Brambul. DHS\nand FBI recommend that network administrators review the information provided, identify\nwhether any of the provided IP addresses fall within their organizations’ allocated IP address\nspace, and—if found—take necessary measures to remove the malware.\n\nWhen reviewing network perimeter logs for the IP addresses, organizations may find\ninstances of these IP addresses attempting to connect to their systems. Upon reviewing the\ntraffic from these IP addresses, system owners may find some traffic relates to malicious\nactivity and some traffic relates to legitimate activity.\n\n## Impact\n\nA successful network intrusion can have severe impacts, particularly if the compromise\nbecomes public. Possible impacts include\n\ntemporary or permanent loss of sensitive or proprietary information,\ndisruption to regular operations,\nfinancial losses incurred to restore systems and files, and\npotential harm to an organization’s reputation.\n\n## Solution\n\n**_Mitigation Strategies_**\n\nDHS recommends that users and administrators use the following best practices as\npreventive measures to protect their computer networks:\n\nKeep operating systems and software up-to-date with the latest patches. Most attacks\ntarget vulnerable applications and operating systems. Patching with the latest updates\ngreatly reduces the number of exploitable entry points available to an attacker.\nMaintain up-to-date antivirus software, and scan all software downloaded from the\ninternet before executing.\nRestrict users’ abilities (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications,\nand apply the principle of least privilege to all systems and services. Restricting these\nprivileges may prevent malware from running or limit its capability to spread through\nthe network.\n\n\n-----\n\nScan for and remove suspicious email attachments. If a user opens a malicious\nattachment and enables macros, embedded code will execute the malware on the\nmachine. Enterprises and organizations should consider blocking email messages from\nsuspicious sources that contain attachments. For information on safely handling email\nattachments, see [Using Caution with Email Attachments. Follow safe practices when](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-010)\n[browsing the web. See Good Security Habits and](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-003) [Safeguarding Your Data for](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/tips/ST06-008)\nadditional details.\nDisable Microsoft’s File and Printer Sharing service, if not required by the user’s\norganization. If this service is required, use strong passwords or Active Directory\n[authentication. See Choosing and Protecting Passwords for more information on](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-002)\ncreating strong passwords.\nEnable a personal firewall on organization workstations and configure it to deny\nunsolicited connection requests.\n\n**_Response to Unauthorized Network Access_**\n\n**Contact DHS or your local FBI office immediately. To report an intrusion and request**\nresources for incident response or technical assistance, contact DHS NCCIC\n[(NCCICCustomerService@hq.dhs.gov or 888-282-0870), FBI through a local field office, or](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:NCCICCustomerService@hq.dhs.gov)\n[FBI’s Cyber Division (CyWatch@fbi.gov or 855-292-3937).](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:CyWatch@fbi.gov)\n\n## References\n\n[[1] Novetta’s Destructive Malware Report](https://www.operationblockbuster.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Operation-Blockbuster-Destructive-Malware-Report.pdf)\n\n## Revisions\n\nMay 29, 2018: Initial version\n\nMay 31, 2018: Uploaded updated STIX and CSV files\n\n[This product is provided subject to this Notification and this](https://www.us-cert.gov/privacy/notification) [Privacy & Use policy.](https://www.dhs.gov/privacy-policy)\n\n**Please share your thoughts.**\n\n[We recently updated our anonymous product survey; we'd welcome your feedback.](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/CISA-cyber-survey?product=https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/TA18-149A)\n\n\n-----",
