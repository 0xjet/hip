Third party security researchers\nnamed the MuddyWater campaign as such because of the difficulties in attributing the attacks.\nHowever, given the nature of the targets, as well as the gathering and uploading of information to\nC&C servers, it appears that the attackers are mainly concerned with espionage activities — with\n[the Saudi Arabia’s National Cyber Security Center (NCSC) publishing an alert on their website](https://www.moi.gov.sa/wps/portal/ncsc/home/Alerts/!ut/p/z0/04_Sj9CPykssy0xPLMnMz0vMAfIjo8ziDQ1dLDyM3A18_M29XQwcnQKD3UyN3Y0dfQ30C7IdFQEpg6mA/)\nregarding the attacks.\n\nGiven the number of similarities, we can assume that there is a connection between these new\nattacks and the MuddyWater campaign. It also signifies that the attackers are not merely interested\nin a one-off campaign, but will likely continue to perform cyberespionage activities against the\ntargeted countries and industries.\n\n[Comparing the earlier MuddyWater campaign with this new one reveals some distinct similiarities:](https://reaqta.com/2017/11/muddywater-apt-targeting-middle-east/)\n\n**2017 MuddyWater Campaign 2018 “MuddyWater”**\n\n**Campaign**\n**Countries of Targeted** Georgia, India, Iraq, Israel, Turkey, Pakistan, Tajikistan\n**Organizations** Pakistan, Saudi Arabia Turkey\n\nUnited Arab Emirates, and the\nUSA\n\n\nsystemd Vulnerability Leads\n[to Denial of Service on](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/systemd-vulnerability-leads-to-denial-of-service-on-linux/)\nLinux\nqkG Filecoder: Self[Replicating, Document-](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/qkg-filecoder-self-replicating-document-encrypting-ransomware/)\nEncrypting Ransomware\nMitigating CVE-2017-5689,\n[an Intel Management Engine](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/mitigating-cve-2017-5689-intel-management-engine-vulnerability/)\nVulnerability\nA Closer Look at North\nKorea’s Internet\nFrom Cybercrime to\nCyberpropaganda\n\nSecurity Predictions for 2018\n\nAttackers are banking on\nnetwork vulnerabilities and\ninherent weaknesses to\nfacilitate massive malware\nattacks, IoT hacks, and\noperational disruptions.

Infection chain for the attack_\n\nOur research found malicious delivery documents (Detected by Trend Micro as\n**JS_VALYRIA.DOCT and W2KM_VALYRIA.DOCT) containing text and file names in the Tajik**\nlanguage attempting to target individuals working for government organizations and\ntelecommunication companies in Tajikistan. Each document uses social engineering to trick\npotential victims into clicking it to enable the macros and activate the payload. While some of the\npayloads we observed were embedded inside the document itself, some of the payloads were also\ndownloaded from the internet after the lure was clicked.There is a separate lure with a program key\ngenerator written in Java that was bundled with a Java downloader. However, the actual payload is\nthe same.\n\nSome examples of the lure documents used in the campaign can be seen below:\n\n_Figure 2. A sample document used in the campaign.

Another example of a header allegedly from the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Tajikistan_\n\nAfter enabling the macros and the payload executes, two files – an obfuscated Visual Basic script\n(Detected by Trend Micro as VBS_VALYRIA.DOCT), and an obfuscated PowerShell script\n(Detected by Trend Mico as TROJ_VALYRIA.PS) — are created in the ProgramData directory\nplaced in randomly-named directories. The purpose of the .VBS script is to execute the PowerShell\nscript. The path to the VBS script is added to the task scheduler as a form of persistence.\n\n_Figure 5. The installed backdoor and persistence script_\n\nIn other campaigns, two files are also dropped. One of them is the VBS script, however, the second\nfile is a base64 encoded text file, which, after decoding, results in the Powershell file, as in the\nprevious campaign. This is one simple layer of obfuscation, likely to avoid some antivirus\ndetections.\n\nThe latest change, drops three files – an.sct scriptlet file, an.inf file and a base64 encoded data file.\nThe scriptlet file and inf file use publicly available code for bypassing applockerCode examples are\nalso available on github.\n\nThe PowerShell script, which employs several layers of obfuscation, is divided into three parts.\n\nPart one contains global variables like paths, encryption keys, a list of a few hundred gates or\nhacked websites which serve as proxies:\n\n_Figure 6. The configuration portion of the PowerShell script_\n\nThe second part contains functions related to the encryption, which is a standard RSA encryption\nwith very small keys.\n\n\np\nMonero Miner Payloads\nCryptocurrency-Mining\n[Malware: 2018’s New](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/cryptocurrency-mining-malware-2018-new-menace/)\nMenace?\nNew AndroRAT Exploits\nDated Privilege Escalation\nVulnerability, Allows\nPermanent Rooting\n\nStay Updated\n\nEmail Subscription\n\n\nYour email here\n\n\nYour email here\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n-----\n\nwaiting for commands.

The clean command wipes drives C, D, E and F_\n\n**_C&C Communication_**\n\nThe communication is done via XML messages with the following supported ACTION commands:\n\nREGISTER\nIMAGE\nCOMMAND RESULT\nUPLOAD\nThe backdoor first finds out the machine IP address by querying the internet service\napi[.]ipify[.]org, which returns the IP address of the currently infected machine. This IP address is\nthen fed to another internet service called apinotes[.]com, which returns the location information of\nthe given IP address.\n\nThe backdoor then collects the system information about the infected machine such as the\nOperating System name, architecture, domain, network adapter configuration, and username. It then\nseparates each piece of information with **, and sends this system info as part of the REGISTER\nmessage:\n\n_Figure 8. The register message before encryption_\n\nA simple RSA algorithm with very small keys encrypts the message seen above. Let’s take the first\ncharacter as an example. Character “{” = 0x7B =123. Variable ${prIVATE} = 959, 713 from\nsection 1 of the PowerShell script has two values; the first number is the key and the second\nnumber is the modulus. By computing (123 ^ 959) mod 713 = 340 we get the encrypted value of\nthe first character (see number 340 in the figure below). The message above gets encrypted as\nshown in figure 9 below, then its contents are sent via post request to one of many hacked gates.\n\n_Figure 9. The register message after encryption_\n\nThe response to this message is another set of decimal numbers which can be decrypted by the\npublic key, which is stored in ${pUbLIC} = 37, 437 variable in part 1 of the PowerShell script.\n\n_Figure 10. The encrypted response to the register message_\n\nThe message above can be decrypted to:\n\n_{“STATUS”: “OK”, “TOKEN”: “d02153ffaf8137b1fa3bb852a27a12f8”}_\n\nThe XML message containing screenshot can be seen below. Note that the previously obtained\nSYSID that serves as a machine identifier, ACTION:”IMAGE” tells us that a base64 encoded\nimage will be followed in IMAGE field.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 11. The XML message with the screenshot_\n\nIt seems that the attackers are actively monitoring the incoming connections to the C&C. In one of\nour attempts, we sent an improper request to the C&C server, which replied with the following\nmessage: “Stop!!! I Kill You Researcher.” This level of personalized messaging implies that the\nattackers are monitoring what data is going to and from their C&C server.\n\n_Figure 12. When the threat actor discovers the researcher via an improper request_\n\n**_Another hidden message or a false flag?_**\n\nFor the PowerShell script, the first part contains a variable named dragon_middle, which is an array\ncontaining a few hundred URLs ending with connection.php that serve as proxies between victim\nand C&C. If communication with C&C fails, and if the PowerShell script is run from a command\nline, a few error messages written in simplified Mandarin Chinese are displayed, with a curious\nphrase that translates to “waiting for dragon”:\n\n无法访问本地计算机寄存器 (Unable to access local computer register)\n任务计划程序访问被拒绝 (Mission Scheduler access is denied)\n无法连接到网址，请等待龙 (Cannot connect to URL, please wait for dragon)\n无法连接到网址，请等待龙 (Cannot connect to website, please wait for dragon)\nThese messages may not reveal anything about the real attackers as the malware writers sometimes\nlike to embed false flags into their programs to confuse researchers. The syntax and grammar\nsuggest that the language could have been machine-translated rather than written by a native\nspeaker.\n\n**_Countermeasures and Trend Micro Solutions_**\n\nUsers unfamiliar with the various kinds of social engineering techniques might find it difficult to\ndistinguish a legitimate message from a malicious one – thus the need for education on identifying\nand mitigating phishing attacks especially if it involves organizations in sensitive industries such\n\n\n-----\n\ny g\n\n[Trend Micro™ Deep Discovery™ provides detection, in-depth analysis, and proactive response to](https://www.trendmicro.com/us/enterprise/security-risk-management/deep-discovery/)\ntoday’s stealthy malware, and targeted attacks in real time.
