None of these apps were available on\nthe official Google Play Store, suggesting they were likely distributed through actor-operated\n[watering holes or third-party app stores. Lookout previously reported on another surveillanceware](https://blog.lookout.com/commercial-surveillanceware-operators-latest-to-take-advantage-of-covid-19?utm_source=BL&utm_medium=BL&utm_campaign=WW-MU-MU-MU-MU-P_NON-SyrianCovidThreat_Blog)\ncampaign using COVID-19 related lures targeting Libya.\n\n_Applications from this surveillance campaign impersonate a variety of applications, with titles such_\n_as “Covid19”, “Telegram Covid_19”, “Android Telegram”, and “Threema Arabic” (an end-to-end_\n_encrypted messaging application), as well as a phone signal booster and OfficeSuite application._\n_Package names also allude to Syrian targeting, with names such as “com.syria.tel”, “syria.tel.ctu”,_\n_and “com.syriatel.ctu”._\n\n## Syrian Connections\n\nLookout researchers found 71 malicious Android applications connected to the same commandand-control (C2) server. The IP address of the C2 server is located in a block of addresses held\nby Tarassul Internet Service Provider, an ISP owned by – and sharing network infrastructure with\n[– the Syrian Telecommunications Establishment (STE) (Freedom House, 2018). STE has a](https://www.refworld.org/docid/5be16af6116.html)\nhistory of hosting infrastructure for the Syrian Electronic Army (SEA), a Syrian state-sponsored\n[hacking group. Notably, the C2 servers of SilverHawk, an Android malware family previously](https://i.blackhat.com/eu-18/Wed-Dec-5/eu-18-DelRosso-Under-the-SEA.pdf)\nreported on by Lookout researchers, were located on IP addresses belonging to STE.\n\nNot all applications in this campaign were completely scrubbed of sensitive information when they\nwere created. A large portion of the malicious applications are SpyNote samples, which store C2\ninformation, along with user inputted names, version numbers, and other information, in\n\n\n-----\n\nres/values/strings.xml. In the strings.xml files of these applications, 22 APKs reference “Allosh”, a\nname previously used in connection with a known Syrian Electronic Army persona.\n\nPrevious strings appearing in other malware associated with the Syrian Electronic Army contain\nthis name, such as “c:\\users\\allosh hacker\\documents\\visual studio\n[2012\\Projects\\allosh\\allosh\\obj\\Debug\\Windows.pdb” mentioned in reporting by Citizen Lab on the](https://citizenlab.ca/2014/03/maliciously-repackaged-psiphon/)\nSEA malicious repackaging of the Psiphon 3 circumvention tool, and “c:\\Users\\Allosh\nHacker\\Desktop\\Application\\obj\\Debug\\Clean Application.pdb” from pdb paths discovered in\nbinaries associated with SilverHawk infrastructure.\n\n_Screenshot of a strings.xml file, and all unique personas discovered in this campaign._\n\nThe Syrian Electronic Army has been active recently, with one of their Twitter accounts claiming\n[responsibility this month for DDoS attacks against Belgian media, as well as defacing PayPal and](https://twitter.com/Official_SEA7/status/1245805216756150273)\neBay websites as recently as April 7, 2020.\n\n_Two of the most recent claims by @Official_SEA7, one of the Syrian Electronic Army’s multiple_\n_Twitter accounts which has been active since 2013._\n\nSyrian authorities are known to heavily censor their country’s internet, with Syria ranking 174th on\n[Reporters Without Borders 2019 World Press Freedom Index. In addition, according to the 2018](https://rsf.org/en/syria)\nFreedom of the Net Report published by Freedom House, an NGO which conducts research and\n\n\n-----\n\nadvocacy on democracy, political freedom, and human rights, “In areas controlled by the\ngovernment, the Syrian Telecommunications Establishment (STE) serves as both an ISP and the\ntelecommunications regulator, providing the government with tight control over the internet\nInfrastructure. Furthermore, private fixed-line and mobile ISPs are required to sign a\nmemorandum of understanding to connect to the international internet via gateways controlled by\n[the Syrian Information Organization (SIO)” (Freedom on the Net 2018).](https://www.justice.gov/eoir/page/file/1181196/download)\n\n_After installation, the original Covid19 application hides its icon and only displays the newly_\n_installed Degree Measure application._\n\nThe newly installed application (com.finger.body.temperature.ap) is a benign prank - a fake digital\nthermometer that serves as a decoy. Meanwhile the malware continues to operate in the\nbackground.\n\n\n-----\n\n_The user holds down on the screen on the fingerprint and is informed that their body temperature_\n_is 35°C._\n\nSome AndoServer samples are purely surveillanceware that do not even pretend to be anything\nelse, while others, like this sample here, contain legitimate applications inside the malware, with\nthe benign APK hidden in the res/raw folder.\n\nAndoServer samples receive commands, and are capable of:\n\n\n## Taking a screenshot Getting battery levels and if the device is plugged in Reporting location (latitude and longitude) Getting a list of installed applications Launching an application specified by the malicious actor Checking the number of cameras on a device Choosing a specific camera to access\n\n\n## Creating a specific pop-up mes‐ sage (toast) Recording audio Creating a file on external storage Exfiltrating call logs Listing files contained in a spec‐ ified directory Calling a phone number Exfiltrating SMS messages Sending SMS to a phone number Exfiltrating the contact list Playing a ringtone and then sleeping\n\n\n-----\n\nAndoServer malware has its C2 domain or IP address hard coded into the source code. Each\nsample also has its own unique identifier string at the start of its communication with C2 servers,\nthat appears to be for the actor to monitor which application in their arsenal is responsible for the\ncompromise, as they can see the unique application installed by the specific victim. While not\nalways the case, some unique identifiers are similar to the name of the C2 domain, while other\ntimes they refer to the title of the application, highlighting another level of customization of this\nmalware.\n\n## Prevalence of Commercial Surveillanceware\n\nOf the malicious applications in this campaign, 64 of 71 are SpyNote samples, a well known\ncommercial surveillanceware family. The remainder belong to the SandroRat, AndoServer, and\nSLRat families, of which the latter two have not yet been publicly reported on.\n\nSLRat appears to have gained popularity since its developer first publicized it in May 2016,\nadvertising it as “the Best and Free android remote admin tool”, while AndoServer has not yet\nbeen seen for sale or mentioned on public forums. Based on samples ingested to date however,\nLookout researchers believe it is also a customizable Android malware that may be for sale, or\nonly known about and used by a smaller group of operators.\n\nGiven Syria’s history of censorship and past mobile and desktop surveillance campaigns, it\nshould come as no surprise that another campaign is active. SilverHawk actors initially entered\nthe mobile malware space using the commercial Android surveillanceware AndroRat, before\ncustomizing it and then developing their own mobile tooling. It is in line with known TTPs that a\nnew commercial or public spy tool might have been adopted and used by this actor as part of new\nsurveillance efforts, and there are likely more to be discovered.\n\n_Lookout has been ingesting samples from the AndoServer and SJRat families since 2016, and_\n_has seen a spike in activity towards the end of 2019._\n\n## IOCs (SHA1 hashes of the malicious apps):\n\n1aefc2ebaf1a78f23473ce6275b0b514bbcdfb08\n213b7f8c3f26a87b116927143289886742b979a1\n321682c8395216b6f71ac1f4a1188040bbddfeb4\n8cae26c899440f890a8faca2e63ba42c0195cd3b\n\n\n-----\n\nccb143b25cedf043a8be46a1f3c3f8a0a3e4c2b2\n61ecf4d82246a22dc2d390eca1e20abd6b961083\n1e30cc843a32db0296502795781f8064adbceee6\na07370617fa695b047359ac345375d05a7135da0\n915e3470e5ab85cb1fe565484b15004a19e88da6\n3bfa1b4d98c02c43e7b3af9e536dbcd79e0b9197\nd14bb8de94e6f6a733b0962c6d0847376286874f\n3c5fd8b163b32cde47dd50c4b61ab087c0cad8d4\n4dcc2d9ef4921b3eb4e4dc72dd3716520d558102\n07c1edf35c60ea6f2ff02df6e0bfa24abb3029c1\n50c607a138e33c8cbdcf2f617f61095b7efa06da\nb1a9bc32ece469d7e2d43e894e68cb3bec17ac82\n34cb80d4e5d19fcaf724b73aacfebbb19c79337e\nc21919c6064c739533878da39d0feaf83e99f586\na62250430da13436b80a62f6a1fee67ed0050e37\n246a17230dbe8a5c533231fa1da80d977985b111\n358653280acdfd84b6ca326c9b06d12878af69c8\n4ec39acfc6f3f9715d0d0e2b0a2f7121d617b605\n9f09a4868f61d174ad075e5acaa8d849294dbf69\n8952bdf2e3d777d01011e6f8619fca8835e8c434\nb9dffff37efbfb8e577ee242c8807db967704a0d\n5f6019eae4a16abd11d981b2da5d4ef05115a5c4\n0b7cf990bb0dc62dd44d9fa6410ca591dfe47a5d\n08162ad39a6237e4eebacf764a5ca6158816a86e\nf2fb9826da43f92ff69686f999f205502a33342c\nc2e5287433a0e3c7d059494e65b87c3c36f74a47\nc7405d85a78a62003494f398084cff8f1794e2ab\n16c9ef6ed5af0855a3e6b963ff9c2d65d70de11e\nbae5c56d3cd888ec19c42bf5d782de327d012a37\n34cc91ad64f52420b6e1531c097ac1602af1f089\n00455a4652faf751753b5ebfbb0656bee530f4ef\nb263eec151b11d0a6ebcfcf37b3b98458d2d530c\n18cc448d71437e7a72558f6680ff10fb234fc64f\n6a68f8d962adae7d767b6dfeb2d5b90be412b1f1\n0fdc50226a7eb9aee6e6422907425d4531290374\naa43f78a2667909546c3cd993a2940b076634379\n5b2e709dfc95e9fc4e4343b92c76cc2193acd49a\ne6962b122e14e59c7c88a25d405d6c653b31590e\n9c83fdecc8429bc278d03116ca9e2cff5013987e\n53653984310845988103051e7acf4ed336150b99\n18451fc0e8fbe878f242e7ee1834091c455f8fc1\n0f7bf07352b4d1852f651dda350fd446b3477740\n615863ce030f3de3e377352637d6ecc55dfd185a\nb46b241620a4d5682e9083ce726827fdbf4a96e5\nab259f11163ea51767a6b17855bc0e79a8ae96e4\n447165f88f951f8d26bc721f3047533a54f59ce0\n29e04da270da0a6bedfcaee3f6fe8251d6cdef31\n\n\n-----\n\n6cebf3c27fb348272b72041451b232f78190f83d\ne99ebc998ab63026b9b40fff55037c1b69a80369\nddf2b474a0ed1b47278d00872a84d2a2405cc33c\n01963c9c70102961cb8b424f623e9be32d7b255b\n8d664c9753f7bf65a8cce69dca5486971d1f06ca\n2d01b7691ce5647e60c566eda33166bf2e9bcc53\n44d8bc4406227aeec9711b74f771c05ddfd3d173\n0c04da70ba0771734f99eba05a5676713675d0e8\n37e11e1a45f166b16170e8d649c3b75ee93e90a8\ndbfbfe43f04c58bcf5daa71df61dcc354bbf2d27\ndc3778ffb7399e009a287983f0113e15fd8b227e\n1a0a65e6b4a2c42e5dc3d7db2179c04952a03948\n69f475024e006b51f7ec6a1990bad460fe9805f0\na32900a79d459da90e49ee8acf23dcfd03bfcb4b\n5c8bf130f8e5c7756674a6d376dd7f25fbded4e4\n\n\n-----",
