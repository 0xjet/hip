Good morning. The Subcommittee on Oversight and Research and Technology will come to order.\nWithout objection, the Chair is authorized to declare recess of the\nSubcommittee at any time.\nThis hearing will be entitled ‘‘Scholars or Spies: Foreign Plots\nTargeting America’s Research and Development.’’ I’m going to recognize myself for five minutes for an opening statement.\nAgain, good morning. Welcome to the joint Oversight and Research and Technology hearing ‘‘Scholars or Spies: Foreign Plots\nTargeting America’s Research and Development.’’ This hearing is\nan opportunity to address the vulnerability of U.S. academic institutions to the threat of foreign exfiltration of valuable science and\ntechnology research and development.\nExfiltration is a new word being used to describe the surreptitious removal of data, as well as R&D, both of which we’ll discuss\ntoday. We look forward to hearing from former government and\nprivate sector experts about the magnitude and consequences of\nthis threat. We are also interested in learning what actions must\nbe taken to prevent or mitigate this threat in the future without\nstifling the collaborative research activities that are critical to the\nUnited States academic sector.\nOver the past few years, case after case has been reported at our\nuniversities and colleges, all with similar themes. After obtaining\naccess to data and other valuable information, individuals, including professors, students, researchers and visitors—some with\nstrong ties to a foreign nation—attempt to take that knowledge to\nforeign governments, universities, or companies.\nAs a medical doctor myself, I found one case particularly concerning. A former associate professor at New York University, specializing in MRI technology, had been working on research sponsored by a grant from the National Institutes of Health. According\nto prosecutors in the initial charges, this individual colluded with\nrepresentatives from a Chinese-sponsored research institute and\nconcealed the fact that he patented technology developed with NIH\nfunds for the purpose of licensing it to a Chinese medical imaging\ncompany for literally millions of dollars.\nThis case and others demonstrate the targeting of the innovation\nand intellectual property from our country’s greatest minds and institutions and, in some cases, the ability for foreign nations to gain\neasy access by exploiting the lax security posture of our academic\ninstitutions.\nThe Science Committee has continuously engaged in vigorous\noversight of federally funded basic research and technology, particularly research with a clear path to commercialization and a direct benefit for U.S. businesses and government. A significant\namount of academic research and development is funded by the\nAmerican taxpayers. Just last year, the Federal Government spent\napproximately $1.5 billion on research and development, in addition to the even larger amount of funding provided by private sector U.S. companies and universities.\nIf this nefarious activity is aimed at recipients of federal grant\nprograms, then it is the American taxpayers that are unwittingly\nfunding the technological advancements and innovative break\n\n-----\n\n6\n\nthroughs that allow foreign nations to improperly gain a competitive economic advantage.\nChina has publicly proven itself to be the most aggressive in the\ntargeting of U.S. research over the past decade. China has heavily\ninvested increasing amounts of financial and physical resources to\nsupport a science and technology industry that is based on the\ntransfer of basic science, which allows that country to prioritize advanced development and commercialization over basic and fundamental research. Essentially, China steals our fundamental research and quickly capitalizes by commercializing the technology.\nWhile much of the discussion and examples used in today’s hearing may focus on China, I want to be clear that this committee is\nvery concerned about all foreign nations and agents that are inappropriately attempting to take advantage of America’s research and\ndevelopment. China’s efforts in particular have provided useful examples to analyze, mainly because of their open and aggressive tactics. However, the recent DOJ charges based on Iran’s actions are\nfurther confirmation that this problem is not confined just to\nChina, and we should assume a number of other bad actors are\nalso making similar attempts.\nTaking that into account, bolstering the cybersecurity of federal\ninformation systems has been among the Committee’s top priorities. I am hopeful that the discussion here today will highlight efforts to accomplish this objective and make prevention a priority of\nall recipients of taxpayer dollars. Whether physical or cybersecurity\nthreats, it is clear that our academic institutions are not taking all\nthe necessary steps to adequately protect this vital research.\nI look forward to the insight of our witnesses today, which will\nhelp us assess these important issues and determine whether additional questions need to be asked of our partners in the executive\nbranch, as well as in academia. We hope to better understand the\nnext steps that must be taken to safeguard the competitiveness\nand security of federally funded research and development, especially the role of U.S. academic institutes.\n\n[The prepared statement of Chairman Abraham follows:]\n\n\n-----\n\n7\n\n###### H\n\nFor Immediate Release Medic Contacts: Thea McDonald, Brandon VerVelde\nApril II, 2018 (202) 225-6371\n\n**Statement by Chairman Ralph Abraham (R-La.)**\n_Scholars or Spies:_ _Foreign Plots Targeting America's Research_ _and Development_\n\n**Chairman Abraham: This** hearing is an opportunity to address the vulnerability of U.S.\nacademic institutions to the threat of foreign exfiltralion of valuable science and technology\nresearch and development (R&D).

I now recognize the Ranking Member of the\nOversight Committee, the gentleman from Virginia, Mr. Beyer, for\nan opening statement.\nMr. BEYER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I’d like to thank you and\nChairwoman Comstock for holding this hearing.\nVigilance against espionage threats is important on all fronts\nfrom cybersecurity breaches to intelligence gathering by covert\noperatives on the ground.\nAs a committee, we’ve conducted numerous bipartisan investigations into cyber breaches. Our June hearing on WannaCry, for instance, gave us context into the recent Iranian attacks on hundreds\nof domestic and foreign universities. Hacking, however, is but one\ntool in a suite of techniques used by intelligence agencies to target\nU.S. universities.\nIn cases of academic-related espionage, student researchers are\nrecruited by a foreign government to study or do research at an\nAmerican institution and pass along sensitive scientific research\nand technology to the foreign government. American universities\nplay a critical role in driving fundamental research and developing\ninnovative technologies for our nation. The loss of this sort of data\ncan have tremendous economic consequences, endanger our national security, and diminish our technological lead in critical technologies.\nAlthough an essential tenet of academia is this open pursuit of\nscientific research professors, students, university scientists need to\nunderstand the potential value of their research to foreign adversaries. They should be properly educated about potential espionage\nthreats and trained on how to take appropriate security measures,\nwhether they’re online or at an international conference presenting\ntheir research findings.\nWhat I do not believe what we want to do, however, is pull the\nwelcome mat from under the more than 1 million foreign students\nto come to America to study every year, contributing more than $36\nbillion to our economy annually, and creating hundreds of thousands of U.S. jobs and contributing to America’s academic leadership. And having just finished paying for the third college education, I’m so grateful for the full tuitions that foreign students\npay, holding down at least a little bit the price that we have to pay.\nThe media has recently painted a poor picture of the academic\ncommunity being disinterested or naive about the potential security threats they face. I’m not sure this is an accurate portrait. The\nhigher education community has several vehicles they use to identify threats and train their members to take actions to mitigate\ntheir vulnerabilities to attack. These include the Research and\nEducation Network, Information Sharing and Analysis Center, the\nHigher Education Information Security Council, and the newly\nformed Omni Security Operations Center described as, quote, ‘‘a\npioneering initiative that helps higher education institutions reduce the impact of cybersecurity threats.’’ The new group that’s\nbased in Indiana University includes collaboration with Northwestern University, Purdue University, Rutgers, and the University of Nebraska Lincoln.\nCooperation in the security arena is critical, and I’m glad to see\nthis sort of cooperation emerging between universities. However,\n\n\n-----\n\n10\n\nthese universities also need the cooperation from the law enforcement and the intelligence community to help ensure that they’re\napprised of specific threats or risks.\nIn 2005, to help foster better lines of communication between the\nFBI and the U.S. academic community, the FBI created the National Security Higher Education Advisory Board originally composed of 15 Presidents and Chancellors of leading universities. But,\nunfortunately, this past February, the members of this board received a letter from the FBI announcing their decision to disband\nit. The letter praised the cooperation between intelligence agencies,\nlaw enforcement, and academia and said the FBI was exploring the\ncreation of a new board. Officials in the academic community, however, believe the board played an important role in helping universities understand the intelligent risks they face and were both surprised and disappointed this board was disbanded with no clear\nplan to replace it.\nSo, Mr. Chairman, I’m attaching this letter to my statement, as\nwell as a letter from the Association of American Universities, the\nAssociation of Public and Land Grant Universities, the American\nCouncil on Education, and the Council on Governmental Relations\nall regarding this important issue.\nChairman ABRAHAM. Without objection.\nMr. BEYER. Thank you.\n\n[The information appears in Appendix II]\nMr. BEYER. Balancing legitimate security risks with international scientific cooperation is critical to ensure that we address\nreal risks appropriately and thoroughly while not diminishing the\nbenefits we have obtained by opening our doors to foreign students\nand collaborating with international partners. We don’t stop using\ncomputers because they’re vulnerable; we take steps to make them\nsafer. Likewise, we cannot let concern over academic espionage\ncrowd out the multitude of benefits from the international exchange of scholarship.\nAmerica’s leadership in science and technology is highly dependent upon its openness to scholars from around the globe. Any action we take to respond to the threat of academic espionage must\ntake into account the value of cooperation. The intelligence community and the academic community should not be at odds but rather\nworking together to secure our sensitive research.\nSo I’m looking forward to hearing from our witnesses today about\nhow we can balance these two important issues regarding security\nand scholarship. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.\n\n[The prepared statement of Mr. Beyer follows:]\n\n\n-----\n\n11\n\nOPENING STATEMENT\n**Ranking Member DonaldS. Beyer (D-VA)**\n**of the Subcommittee on Oversight**\n\nHouse Committee on Science, Space, and Technology\nSubcommittee on Oversight\nSubcommittee on Research and Technology\n_\"Scholars or Spies: Foreign Plots Targeting America's Research and Development\"_\nAprill1,2018\n\nThank you, Chairman Abraham and Chairwoman Comstock.\n\nFirst, I would like to take a moment before digging into the topic of academic espionage to again\nimplore this Committee to take action on Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)\nAdministrator Scott Pruitt. Administrator Pruitt's unethical behavior, wasteful use of taxpayer\nmoney, and his ongoing efforts to undermine the EPA's mission of protecting our environment\nand public health warrant some serious congressional oversight. I have previously requested that\nChairman Smith bring Administrator Pruitt before the Science Committee to testify, as is\nstandard practice and now, amidst various scandals, this is more crucial than ever.\nAdministrator Pruitt's predecessor, Gina McCarthy, testified before this Committee on three\noccasions during the second term of the Obama Administration, testifying first just four months\nafter her confirmation. By comparison, Administrator Pruitt was confitmed 14 months ago, but\nhas yet to appear before the Committee. Pruitt cannot be allowed to continue to sell our nation's\nclean air and water to special interests without consequences- if the President refuses to hold\nhim accountable Congress must do its job and conduct meaningful oversight.\n\nTurning back to the topic of the day: vigilance against espionage threats is important on all\nfronts, from cybersecurity breaches to intelligence gathering by covert operatives on the ground.\nAs a committee, we have conducted numerous bipartisan investigations into cyber breaches.\nHacking, however, is but one tool used by intelligence agencies to target U.S. universities. In\ncases of academic-related espionage, a student or researcher is recruited by a foreign goverruncnt\nto study or do research at an American institution and passes along sensitive scientific research\nor technology to the foreign goverrunent. American universities play a critical role in driving\nfundamental research and developing innovative technologies for our nation.

Beyer (D-VA)**\n**of the Subcommittee on Oversight**\n\nHouse Committee on Science, Space, and Technology\nSubcommittee on Oversight\nSubcommittee on Research and Technology\n_\"Scholars or Spies: Foreign Plots Targeting America's Research and Development\"_\nAprill1,2018\n\nThank you, Chairman Abraham and Chairwoman Comstock.\n\nFirst, I would like to take a moment before digging into the topic of academic espionage to again\nimplore this Committee to take action on Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)\nAdministrator Scott Pruitt. Administrator Pruitt's unethical behavior, wasteful use of taxpayer\nmoney, and his ongoing efforts to undermine the EPA's mission of protecting our environment\nand public health warrant some serious congressional oversight. I have previously requested that\nChairman Smith bring Administrator Pruitt before the Science Committee to testify, as is\nstandard practice and now, amidst various scandals, this is more crucial than ever.\nAdministrator Pruitt's predecessor, Gina McCarthy, testified before this Committee on three\noccasions during the second term of the Obama Administration, testifying first just four months\nafter her confirmation. By comparison, Administrator Pruitt was confitmed 14 months ago, but\nhas yet to appear before the Committee. Pruitt cannot be allowed to continue to sell our nation's\nclean air and water to special interests without consequences- if the President refuses to hold\nhim accountable Congress must do its job and conduct meaningful oversight.\n\nTurning back to the topic of the day: vigilance against espionage threats is important on all\nfronts, from cybersecurity breaches to intelligence gathering by covert operatives on the ground.\nAs a committee, we have conducted numerous bipartisan investigations into cyber breaches.\nHacking, however, is but one tool used by intelligence agencies to target U.S. universities. In\ncases of academic-related espionage, a student or researcher is recruited by a foreign goverruncnt\nto study or do research at an American institution and passes along sensitive scientific research\nor technology to the foreign goverrunent. American universities play a critical role in driving\nfundamental research and developing innovative technologies for our nation. The loss of this sort\nof data can have tremendous economic consequences, endanger our national security, and\ndiminish our technological lead in critical technologies.\n\nAlthough an essential tenet of academia is its open pursuit of scientific research, professors,\nstudents and university scientists need to understand the potential value of their research to\nforeign adversaries.

I yield back.\n\n\n-----\n\n13\n\nChairman ABRAHAM. Thank you. And I now recognize the Chairman of the full committee, the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Lamar\nSmith.\nChairman SMITH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Also, I want to\nthank Chairwoman Comstock for letting me jump in ahead of her.\nI have a bill before the Judiciary Committee this morning that’s\nbeing marked up, so I’m going to need to excuse myself shortly, but\nI will be back to ask questions.\nMr. Chairman, foreign countries’ attempts to access and steal\nU.S. research and development pose an acute risk to our national\nand economic security. In recent months, the public has become\naware that we are under attack from foreign governments that\nwant to steal our technological secrets and scientific discoveries\nand use them for their own purposes.\nJust last month, the U.S. Department of Justice showed how serious the threat is. DOJ indicted nine Iranian nationals for breaking into university computer systems and stealing information and\nintellectual property worth billions of dollars. This brazen theft\nwas on behalf of the Iranian government and universities in Iran.\nThis was a widespread and concentrated campaign. Attackers\nhacked nearly 4,000 accounts of professors across 144 U.S. universities. According to informed sources, the attackers specifically targeted universities engaged in science, technology, and medical research.\nAccording to the Justice Department, U.S. universities spent\nmore than $3.4 billion on creating and developing the scientific information, academic data, and intellectual property that was stolen. Nearly $3.5 billion of U.S. research, some of which was funded\nby American taxpayers, was illegally taken and is now in the\nhands of a hostile foreign nation. This is just one example.\nUnfortunately, Iran is not the only threat. China has actively\nand aggressively targeted research and development at U.S. academic institutions for years. The Chinese Government has been\nvery clear about its long-range plans for achieving global domination in critical areas of science and technology. China, however, has\nbeen less than forthright about its methods, which include theft of\nconfidential information and technological secrets from U.S. companies, cyber attacks, and other forms of spying to undermine our national security and putting sleeper agents at our own research universities to steal our scientific breakthroughs.\nChinese efforts are concentrated in the areas that it has\nprioritized: artificial intelligence, medical science, and national security. By understanding China’s priorities and the lengths to\nwhich it is prepared to go, we can adopt an effective approach, but\nthe first step is recognizing the risks we face.\nThe intelligence community has warned about these threats for\nyears, ranging from cyber attacks to human manipulation to breakins. We know that foreign agents routinely target American students and educators in their priority areas. Faculty and administrators must be alert and educated to spot the warning signs of foreign operations. But many in academia have been unwilling to accept reality and unwilling to take any defensive measures to protect their researchers’ work, their universities’ scientific assets, and\ntaxpayers’ investments.\n\n\n-----\n\n14\n\nThe University of Texas recently rejected funding from the\nChina-United States Exchange Foundation, a China-based and government-connected foundation. The foundation is registered as a\nforeign agent representing China. The idea of a university taking\nsignificant funding from an organization controlled by a foreign\ngovernment would be contrary to the independence and safeguards\nneeded in academia. This action by the University of Texas was appropriate and the type of proactive oversight that needs to occur at\nother colleges.\nThe National Science Foundation’s grant guidance is clear: As\ngrant recipients, universities bear full responsibility for the management and results of federally funded projects. The recent indictments of Iranian student-spies and other incidents are clear warnings about the need for swift, strong action. This includes improved\ncybersecurity, educating researchers to anticipate attempts to steal\ntheir work, and more careful screening of those who come to the\nUnited States to study.\nI also look forward to hearing from our experts about how we can\nbuild appropriate defenses. On the one hand, we must maintain\nthe open and collaborative nature of academic research and development. On the other, we must protect our research and development from actors who seek to do us harm.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.

Thank you very much, Chairman Abraham and\nChairwoman Comstock, for convening this hearing today, and\nthanks to the panel that agreed to appear before us.\nAmerica’s superior academic institutions have drawn the best\nand the brightest from around the world, and we have benefited\ngreatly from their contributions. From 1960 to 2017, foreign immigrants who settled in America won 81 Nobel Prizes in chemistry,\nmedicine, and physics. In 2016, all six Americans who won Nobel\nPrizes in chemistry, physics, and economics were immigrants.\nMany of these immigrants came here as international students.\nAcademic and intellectual openness are key to the success of\nAmerican higher education and America’s leadership in science and\ntechnology. However, we do face legitimate and serious threats\nfrom foreign adversaries. They are targeting our scientific innovations and advanced technologies whether at our government-funded\nlaboratories, in our industries, or on the campuses of our universities. The theft of—plunder of our critical technologies must be\nclearly addressed and prevented.\nOur counterintelligence community must work hand-in-hand\nwith research institutions to help mitigate the risk of these threats.\nThese institutions need to be engaged in applying best practices in\ntheir approach to security and know how to identify acts of espionage.

It is vital to our national security.\nHowever, we need to be careful that any security measures do\nnot stifle the benefits our country realizes from legitimate international academic collaboration. At the same time, we should also\nexamine the reasons why universities find international students\nso attractive. Part of the reason is economic. Nationwide, States\nhave reduced levels of financial support to our respective public institutions of higher learning. Universities have responded by cutting financial aid and raising tuition fees.

Thank you, Ms. Johnson.\nI now recognize the Chair of the Research and Technology Subcommittee, Mrs. Comstock, for an opening statement.\nMrs. COMSTOCK. Thank you, Chairman Abraham, for holding a\nhearing on this important and serious issue. It would be easy to\nthink about the theft of information from American universities by\nforeign students to be the topic of a modern-day spy novel, but in\nfact it is a very real problem and, sadly, not a new one. My predecessor in the House, Representative Frank Wolf, also worked on\nthis important issue.\nAcademic institutions in the United States are valued for their\nopenness, innovation, and collaboration with domestic and international scientists. Our nation has long been a leader in science\nand technology research and development, and consequently, a\nmagnet for foreign scholars and scientists seeking to learn from\nand collaborate with the best.\nUnfortunately, various immoral actors have sought to exploit our\nopenness to steal American ingenuity and innovation and undermine our system. Such thefts can enable foreign nations to save\nthemselves billions in research and development costs and support\ntechnological advances that they may otherwise be unable to make\non their own in order to gain an industrial or, even more troubling,\na military advantage.\nThe FBI has been warning our academic community about these\nthreats for years, while also urging measures be taken to guard\nagainst such activity. Since much of the stolen information comes\nfrom research funded by federal agencies, these nations are ultimately stealing ideas and innovations from American taxpayers\nlike you and me, undermining the policy intent of federal funding\nfor such research in the first place. It is imperative that our academic institutions not close their eyes to the very real threat posed\nby foreign intelligence spies. They cannot be blinded by naivete or\nignorance when distinguishing between friend and foe.\nBut to be clear, the solution is not to shutter the doors of American universities and colleges to students, researchers, and professors from foreign nations. The vast majority of scholars who come\nto the United States do so to work with our citizens on scientific\ndiscoveries and breakthroughs based on an open exchange of ideas\nto benefit the scientific community and the world.\nFinding an appropriate balance between scientific openness and\nsecurity concerns is not new, nor is it easy, but it’s essential. As\nour world continues to be increasingly connected electronically,\nwith more devices that can be used to covertly take pictures or\nscans, it is getting easier for foreign criminals to steal our information.

Thank you, Mrs. Comstock.\nLet me introduce the witnesses now. Our first witness today is\nHonorable Michael Wessel, a Commissioner of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission. Mr. Wessel previously\nworked for the Federal Trade Deficit Commission in 1999 and\n2000. He’s spent more than 2 decades as a staffer for former House\nDemocratic leader Richard Gephardt. Mr. Wessel currently works\nfor the Alliance for American Manufacturing; Wessel Group, Inc.;\nand Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company. He holds a bachelor of arts\ndegree and a juris doctor degree from George Washington University.\nOur second witness is Honorable Michelle Van Cleave, the\nformer National Counterintelligence Executive. Ms. Van Cleave is\na former staffer of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee,\nserving as Counsel in 1989. More recently, she was Special Assistant to the Under Secretary for Policy and Senior Advisor to the\nSecretary of the Army for Homeland Defense within the Department of Defense from 2001 to 2003 before becoming the national\nCounterintelligence Executive under George W. Bush. Ms. Van\nCleave received both her bachelor’s and master’s of arts degrees in\ninternational relations from the University of Southern California.\nShe also earned her juris doctor from the University of Southern\nCalifornia School of Law.\nOur next witness is Mr. Daniel Golden. He’s an author of the\nbook Spy Schools. Mr. Golden is a Pulitzer Prize-winning writer\nwith his work regarding admissions preferences at prominent\nAmerican universities when he worked at the Wall Street Journal.\nHe is currently a Senior Editor with ProPublica and previously\nworked at Bloomberg News from 2009 to 2016. He received a bachelor’s degree from Harvard University. It’s good to have a Pulitzer\nPrize winner among us.\nOur fourth witness is Mr. Crane Hassold, Director of Threat Intelligence at PhishLabs. Mr. Hassold previously worked for the\nFederal Bureau of Investigations from 2004 to 2015 in a variety of\nanalyst positions. Since that time, he had been working with\nPhishLabs in a threat research role. He holds a bachelor of science\ndegree from James Madison University.\nI now recognize Honorable Michael Wessel for five minutes to\npresent his testimony.\n\n**TESTIMONY OF THE HONORABLE MICHAEL WESSEL,**\n**COMMISSIONER, U.S.-CHINA ECONOMIC**\n**AND SECURITY REVIEW COMMISSION**\n\nMr. WESSEL. Thank you, Chairs Abraham, Comstock, and Smith,\nRanking Members Beyer, Lipinski, and Johnson. It’s great to be\nhere before the committee, and it’s an honor to appear before you.\nMy name is Michael Wessel, and I’m a Commissioner on the\nU.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission. While appearing before you in my capacity as a Commissioner, the views I\nexpress are my own, although of course my views are informed by\nthe work I and my colleagues do.\nThis hearing is particularly timely in light of the President’s actions to confront China’s policies in the intellectual property arena.\nChina has stolen, coerced, and subsidized the massive transfer of\n\n\n-----\n\n25\n\nintellectual property to their country from the United States. These\nefforts have advanced their economic and military power.\nClearly, not everything is a zero-sum game. Advancements in\nscience, medicine, technology, and innovation can improve the lives\nof all people around the globe, but China is not as interested in advancing global interests as much as their own.\nChina has made their priorities public. Most important for this\nhearing is China’s Made in China 2025 Initiative, which identified\n10 key sectors the government would support to be global leaders\nin, which have significant economic and national security implications. They range from new energy vehicles to biotech, robotics,\nnext-generation information technology, and high-tech ships. China\nis using an all-of-government approach to stakeout dominant positions in the global market in these technologies with the commitment of hundreds of billions of dollars. China will do whatever it\ntakes legally or illegally to achieve its goals.\nMy colleagues will talk about many of the illegal means. I will\nfocus on some of China’s key public programs and their targeting.\nPerhaps the most well-known program is the propagation and\nfunding of Confucius Institutes all over the globe with roughly 100\nhere in the United States, as was noted earlier. They are purported\nto teach Chinese language, culture, and history. As Politico noted\nearlier this year, the Confucius Institutes’ goals are little less\nwholesome and edifying than they sound, and this by the Chinese\nGovernment’s own account.\nChina is willing to influence the current and future generations\nof American leaders, their views, and their research. Last week,\nTexas A&M terminated its Confucius Institute after Congressman\nMcCaul and Cuellar wrote that, quote, ‘‘These organizations are a\nthreat to our nation’s security by serving as a platform for China’s\nintelligence collection and political agenda.’’\nAnother significant program is known as Project 111. Under that\nprogram was the Thousand Talents program, which is designed to\nrecruit foreign experts in strategic sectors from the world’s top universities to come to China to assist in achieving their goals. The\ntarget is now 4,000 participants. Participants receive extensive\nbenefits, including a bonus payment of roughly $158,000, in addition to salaries based on previous levels.\nThe FBI’s Counterintelligence Strategic Partnership has warned\nthat these programs pose a threat to our nation’s academic community. And I quote, ‘‘Chinese talent programs pose a serious threat\nto U.S. businesses and universities through economic espionage\nand theft of intellectual property.’’ The different programs focus on\nspecific fields deemed critical to China to boost China’s national capability in S&T fields.\nThe size of the foreign student population of the United States\nis significant and raises interest—issues that merit attention. Of\nthe more than 1 million international students studying here,\nChina accounted for 32.5 percent of the total or roughly 350,000.\nChinese students have a significant presence on many campuses\nand in many labs where critical research is being done. Many of\nthese labs receive significant federal funding from the Department\nof Defense or the National Science Foundation. At the Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research Lab, roughly 20 percent of the Ph.D.\n\n\n-----\n\n26\n\nstudents are PRC nationals. At the University of Maryland’s Bing\nNano Research Group, 30 of the 38 postdoctoral researchers and\ngraduate students are from China. Every one of the visiting researchers and professors utilizing J visas are from China. The lab\nreceives support from 15 different federal agencies, including\nNASA, DARPA, the Air Force Office of Scientific Research, and the\nDepartment of Energy.\nBilateral scientific cooperation programs also bear attention as\nthere are questions about the real value of some of those programs\nto us. Sunlight is a great disinfectant, and today’s hearing is an important step in that process. Raising awareness to the potential\nrisks associated with China’s academic activities vis-a-vis U.S. interests is key. In my prepared testimony, I provided a number of\nrecommendations about actions that could be considered. In questions and answers I would be happy to talk about any of them.\nWe cannot allow the debate and actions on this issue to fuel the\ntargeting of Chinese people—citizens or people of Chinese descent.\nI believe that there can be broad bipartisan support for commonsense approaches that recognize the diversity strengthens, not\nweakens us. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n\n[The prepared statement of Mr. Wessel follows:]\n\n\n-----\n\n27\n\nPrepared Testimony\nof Michael Wessel\nbefore the joint\nOversight and Research and Technology Subcommittees\nHouse Science, Space and Technology Committee\n\nAprilll, 2018\n\nChairs Abraham and Comstock.

I am the only Commissioner who has served from the Commission's creation and have\nwitnessed this evolving relationship during that time.\n\nThe Commission is a somewhat unique body: We report to and support Congress. Each of the\nfour Congressional leaders appoint 3 members to the Commission for 2-year terms. In 7 of the\nlast l 0 years, we have issued unanimous reports. In the 3 years where it was not unanimous,\nthere was only one dissenting vote. In many ways, the challenges and opportunities posed by\nthe relationship with China have united us in our analysis.\n\nWhile appearing before you in my capacity as a Conunissioner, the views I express are my own,\nalthough, of course, my views are infonncd by the work I and my colleagues do.\n\nToday's hearing is very timely as China's leaders have solidified their power and, in tum, the\nability to fulfill their plans to become a global technology leader, if not the global technology\nleader in the not-too-distant future. China has well-developed and aggressive plans in this area.\nTheir plans are public and provide a clear roadmap for them to follow, and for us to assess.\n\n1\n\n\n-----\n\n28\n\nUnfortunately, until only the last two years. public policy leaders either largely ignored China's\npublic pronounc<:ments or simply didn't properly assess their competence and commitment in\nreaching those goals. That has been a huge mistake and has led to rapid advancements by China\nin ways that have been fueled by U.S. omissions and commissions.\n\nThis hearing is also particularly timely in light of the President's actions to confront Chinese\npolicies in the intellectual property arena. The press is writing about the threatened imposition\nof tariffs by both the U.S. and China, but has not focused sufficiently on the underlying issues\nthat have plagued U.S. businesses and innovators for years. This hearing, in part, will help to\nshed light on some of those issues.\n\nChina is committed to achieving its goals and will engage in legal means if possible, and illegal\nmeans, if necessary to achieve those goals. There are many areas that fall under the jurisdiction\nof this Subcommittee that bear on China's future success. and ours.\n\nCet1ainly, not everything is a zero-sum game. Important research and advancements in science.\nmedicine, technology and innovation can improve the lives of people all around the globe.\nThere is a global commons that must foster global participation by scientists and researchers\nallowing for sharing of basic and applied research. Many of the most troubling problems of\nyesterday, today and tomoiTOW will only be solved by collaboration.\n\nThat ongoing effort, unfm1unately, is being undermined by the activities and operations of the\nChinese govemment and those operating at its direction and on its behalf:\n\nWe must act to preserve our own technology and conti·ont China's predatory and protectionist\npolicies and actions if we are to ensure that that global commons can exist. That requires action\nnow.\n\nWe must ensure that action to address the policies and practices of the Chinese government and\nthose acting on its behalf or at its direction, does not devolve into approaches that undermine\nAmerican ideals and interests. We cannot allow the debate and actions on this issue to fuel the\ntargeting of Chinese citizens or people of Chinese descent.

The decision to take action to counter these policies is\nlong overdue. In the past, dialogue and pressure has been a substitute for action and, during that\ntime, China has dramatically enhanced its capabilities and is either a near peer, or peer, in many\ntechnology domains.\n\nWhen China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, many economists overestimated or,\nindeed, were limited by ideological blinders in thinking China would just continue to compete\nagainst the U.S. in low-value products likes toys and textiles. Last year, China ran a surplus in\nAdvanced Technology Trade (ATP) with the U.S. of $135.3 billion. The quantity and\ncomposition of our trade with China has changed dramatically since 200 I.\n\nSome of China's advances are the result of our naivete and policy mistakes.\n\nThe U.S. has essentially failed to address Chinese industrial policies since its membership in the\nWTO. Before that, as early as the mid-1990s, the U.S. took only limited acts against Chinese\nintellectual property rights violations. Over the years, several memorandums of understanding\nwere signed between our two countries meant to throttle back some of China's policies. But.\ntheir illegal acts continue and, indeed, increased in effectiveness. The China Commission has\ntracked these mistakes over the years. Numerous public and private reports have documented\nthese violations as well as these industrial policies and their cost to the U.S. in terms of\nproduction, johs and lost economic benefits.\n\nThe U.S. was na!ve in thinking that China wanted to be just like us when it acceded to the WTO.\nWe viewed the commitments from a \"Western\". free market. rulc-ot:law perspective. China\nsimply had and retains a different view of what its commitments meant or, perhaps, simply had\nno intention of abiding by the promises they were making.\n\nOur lopsided trade relationship with China has also fueled China's development and advances in\nthe science and technology arena. Since China joined the WTO, we have amassed an\naccumulated merchandise trade deficit of roughly $4.3 trillion. That is a transfer of wealth. It\nhas allowed China to make massive investments in its future- many of which are to our nation's\ndisadvantage.\n\nThere are policy errors we have made here that have made us vulnerable to many of China's\napproaches to advancing their aims. Regarding the specific topic of this hearing, the\nexploitation of U.S. academic institutions; public and private funding pressures have provided an\nincentive for our colleges and universities to embrace China's well-funded approach. As costs\nhave risen and budgets have not kept pace, the willingness of international students to pay the\n\n\n72 U.S. Nobel Prizes awarded in chemistry, medicine and physics, 25 or 35% of them, were\nawarded to immigrants.\n\nThe Administration's recent Section 301 investigation on the activities by China to force our\ncompanies to transfer their technology to gain market access, as well as protectionist policies and\noutright IP theft, documents some of this.

Regarding the specific topic of this hearing, the\nexploitation of U.S. academic institutions; public and private funding pressures have provided an\nincentive for our colleges and universities to embrace China's well-funded approach. As costs\nhave risen and budgets have not kept pace, the willingness of international students to pay the\n\n3\n\n\n-----\n\n30\n\nfull cost of tuition is a powerful incentive for their being admitted to our universities and\ncolleges. Coupled with generous funding for Confucius Institutes, grants and support for\nindividual professors and graduate students, suppott te)r individuals through the .. 1,000 Talents\nProgram .., as well as through other efforts; the temptations are great and China has capitalized on\nthe desire for funding.\n\nFunding limitations have put additional pressures on other research efforts and overall\ndevelopment ofS&T in the U.S. According to the National Science Foundation's 2018 Report\non Science and Engineering indicators, the U.S. remains the world's leader in S&T investment.\nbut that lead is shrinking as China's footprint grows. According to the report. U.S. R&D\nexpenditures were $496 billion while China was a close second at $408 billion, growing at an\naverage rate of 18% annually since 2000, as compared to only 4% annual growth in the U.S.\n\nAs I noted earlier, approaching the core issue before the Subcommittee today requires a\nrecognition of the impottance of international cooperation and engagement. But. it's also wa)\npast time to directly confront many of the specific programs and policies that China utilizes to\nadvance its own interests with the clear intent of doing so to the cost of U.S. interests.\n\nMy co-panelists today will speak to many of the specific actions and activities that threaten U.S.\ninterests. I will focus much of my attention on the policies and programs that provide the\nframework for the actions.\n\nConfronting China requires that we understand what their plans and programs are. They are\nquite public in their direction and goals. One only has to look at their 12'h and 131h Five Year\nPlans, the so-called China 2025 program and other public pronouncements.\n\nChina has made clear that they want to advance their own capabilities in a number of key sectors\nfor the fhturc. But, they are not simply satisfied with advances. In many areas, they want to\nensure that they have \"national\" champions who can dominate these sectors; they want to ensure\nthat they have the capabilities to source their own needs from indigenous companies and they\nwant to have companies that are significant players internationally.

According to the report. U.S. R&D\nexpenditures were $496 billion while China was a close second at $408 billion, growing at an\naverage rate of 18% annually since 2000, as compared to only 4% annual growth in the U.S.\n\nAs I noted earlier, approaching the core issue before the Subcommittee today requires a\nrecognition of the impottance of international cooperation and engagement. But. it's also wa)\npast time to directly confront many of the specific programs and policies that China utilizes to\nadvance its own interests with the clear intent of doing so to the cost of U.S. interests.\n\nMy co-panelists today will speak to many of the specific actions and activities that threaten U.S.\ninterests. I will focus much of my attention on the policies and programs that provide the\nframework for the actions.\n\nConfronting China requires that we understand what their plans and programs are.

One only has to look at their 12'h and 131h Five Year\nPlans, the so-called China 2025 program and other public pronouncements.\n\nChina has made clear that they want to advance their own capabilities in a number of key sectors\nfor the fhturc.

They arc prepared to do\nwhatever it takes to achieve these goals committing massive funds to accomplish them and\nengaging in legal and illegal activities in their pursuit.\n\nWhat has China Targeted?\n\nChina has targeted a broad range of industries for development and preferential status in their\nFive-Year Plans and other policy pronouncements.

Thank you, Mr. Wessel.\nI now recognize Honorable Michelle Van Cleave for five minutes\nto present her testimony.\n\n**TESTIMONY OF THE HONORABLE MICHELLE VAN CLEAVE,**\n**FORMER NATIONAL COUNTERINTELLIGENCE EXECUTIVE**\n\nMs. VAN CLEAVE. Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman, and Members of the Committee.\nI had the honor of serving as the first national head of U.S. counterintelligence. I was appointed by President Bush in 2003, and I\nhave spent the years since leaving office with a continuing sense\nof gratitude for the honor of having served in that capacity and a\ncontinuing sense of obligation to share what I learned. I’m especially grateful, therefore, for the opportunity to be here this morning to share some of these insights with you as they pertain to the\nsubject of today’s hearing.\nThe United States is a spy’s paradise. Our free and open society\nis tailor-made for clandestine operations. As this committee is so\nwell aware, American R&D, the engine for raw ideas and products\nand capabilities and wealth, is systematically targeted by foreign\ncollectors to fuel their business and industry and military programs\nat our expense.\nChina and Russia both have detailed shopping lists of targeted\nU.S. technologies and specific strategies for clandestine acquisition,\nranging from front companies to joint R&D projects to cyber theft\nto old-fashioned espionage. U.S. academic institutions with their\ngreat concentration of creative talents and cutting-edge research\nand open engagement with the world of ideas are an especially attractive environment for these kinds of activities.\nLet me say the numbers are frankly staggering. For every dollar\nwe invest, some $510 billion annually, we lose most if not all of\nthat equivalent amount to these kinds of illicit activities every\nyear. Each year, reports out of U.S. counterintelligence show numbers that are worse than the year before. Losses are growing, numbers of foreign collectors are growing, vulnerabilities are growing,\nand the erosion of U.S. security and economic strength is also\ngrowing.\nSo why don’t we do more to disrupt these operations before adversaries make off with our trade secrets, our national security secrets, and other valuable information? Let me ask you to hold that\nthought.\nThe last time I sat in this witness chair was five years ago at\nanother Oversight hearing on this very subject. In fact, Mr. Chairman, as we were sitting here having that hearing, the case that\nyou referenced, the MRI exfiltration at NYU, there were surveillance cameras watching them at that very moment. And toward\nthe end of that hearing, one of the members asked me very pointedly, ‘‘Isn’t there a way we can go on offense? Isn’t there a way?’’\n‘‘Yes,’’ I answered, ‘‘there is, but national security leadership must\nbe prepared to change the way we do the counterintelligence business if we are going to do that.’’ So today, I’d like to pick up at that\nbottom line and get to that point.\nUnlike most other nations in the world, the United States has\nnever had a national counterintelligence service. Instead, counter\n\n-----\n\n40\n\nintelligence grew up as part of the distributed responsibilities of\nthe three operational agencies—the FBI, whose principal responsibility is to find the spies here and put them in jail; the CIA, whose\njob is to make sure that their clandestine collection operates securely in all the realms in which it is asked to operate; and the\nmilitary services, who have to be worried about foreign intelligence\nthreats to our military operations abroad.\nAnd they’re all very good at what they do. But throughout our\nhistory, most of our history, there was no national head of counterintelligence to integrate all of these various activities or to provide\na common picture of the threat or to identify gaps or to warn of\nthese activities. And 16 years ago, the Congress took a look at this\nand said this isn’t working right. We have got to make some\nchanges.\nThe _Counterintelligence Enhancement Act of 2002_ was passed to\ncreate a national head of counterintelligence to integrate all these\nthings—to provide warning of foreign intelligence threats to the\nUnited States, to find ways of filling in the seams so that foreign\nespionage couldn’t exploit those seams, and to make sure that we\nwere aware of these kinds of strategic threats to our activities,\nthese kinds of R&D exfiltration, and broader threats to the United\nStates, information threats, cyber exploitation, influence operations. These were the things that the office that I headed was\nasked to worry about.\nAnd when I served in that job, we took a look at how CI was distributed in this country, and we said, you know, tinkering around\nthe edges isn’t going to do. We need to make substantial changes\nin the way we do these operations. We need to have a strategic\ncounterintelligence program that knits together different activities,\nthat characterizes a threat, that gets ahead of the threat, by understanding how these foreign intelligence services operate, how they\nare structured, how they’re tasked, and and what their\nvulnerabilities are so that we can get inside of them and stop them\nbefore they hurt us.\nUnfortunately, the strategy that President Bush issued to go\nforth and do these things in a proactive way was never implemented. Now, why is that? Well, it was signed in 2005. That was\nthe same year that the Director of National Intelligence Office was\nfirst created. There was a lot of new bureaucracy and many new\npriorities, which pulled away resources and direction from what we\nwere trying to do.\nAt the same time, the bigger problem was there was no real strategic counterintelligence program that the new law mandated, so it\nwas easy not to follow through on these things because there was\nno requirement in fact to do that.\nI know my time is short, but I do want to urge that we spend\na little time talking more about what can be done and how effective\nwe could be if we worked our counterintelligence as a strategic tool\nof the nation’s national security strategy. That possibility is open\nto us. And I will suggest to you that if we continue to just go along\nwith the old business model of how we’ve been working case by\ncase by case instead of going after the service proactively as a target, as I know our professional community in fact could do if national leadership gave them that direction, we will continue to have\n\n\n-----\n\n41\n\nthese unacceptable losses to our nation. Changes are possible. Good\nthings can happen, but leadership is required.

The advent of social media\nhas opened the door even wider. As FBI Director Christopher Wray explained before the\nSenate Intelligence Committee earlier this year,\n\nThe use of non-traditional collectors, especially in the academic settingwhether it's professors, scientists, students- we see in almost every field office\nthat the FBI has around the country. It's not just in major cities. It's in small\nones as well, it's across basically every discipline. And I think the level of naivete\non the part of the academic sector about this creates its own issues.\n\nThey're exploiting the very open research and development environment that\nwe have, which we all revere. But they're taking advantage of this. One of the\nthings we're trying to do is to view the Chinese threat as not just a whole of\ngovernment threat, but a whole-of-society threat, on their end. And I think it's\ngoing to take a whole-of-society response by us. It's not just the Intelligence\nCommunity, but it's raising awareness within our academic sector, within our\nprivate sector, as part of defense. 7\n\nRaising awareness is obviously an important part of the answer. But so is raising our ability to\nact. And that's not a private sector job; it's a U.S. government job.\n\nYear after year, we dutifully collect data about how much of our nation's wealth is\nhemorrhaging out the door through illicit foreign collection. For its part, the Congress properly\nattempts to raise awareness through hearings such as this, passes new legislation to strengthen\nlaw enforcement's reach and victims' legal recourse, gives the President sanctions authority,\nand advances security measures to protect against these activities. Yet, as important as they\nare, more robust security programs, awareness training, FOCI regulations, diplomatic\ndemarches and tech transfer laws alone- the current suite of our technology protection efforts\n-will never be enough to stop these massive programs of state-orchestrated technology theft.\n\nWhich brings me back to our hearing, five years ago. Toward the end, one of the Members\nasked pointedly, Isn't there a way we can _go on offense?_ Yes, I answered, there most certainly\nis- but national leadership must be willing to revamp our counterintelligence enterprise to get\nthere.\n\nToday I thought we might pick up where that conversation left off. To be sure,\ncounterintelligence is only one part of the policy mix that is needed to effectively counter illicit\ntechnology acquisition. But I have observed that the government's ability to identify and\ndisrupt foreign intelligence operations is the piece too often neglected in open discussions such\nas this ... or even within national security councils behind closed doors.\n\n\nU.S. academic institutions, with their great concentration of creative talent, cutting edge\nresearch endeavors, and open engagement with the world of ideas, are an especially attractive\nenvironment for foreign collectors targeting America's R&D wealth.

And that's not a private sector job; it's a U.S. government job.\n\nYear after year, we dutifully collect data about how much of our nation's wealth is\nhemorrhaging out the door through illicit foreign collection. For its part, the Congress properly\nattempts to raise awareness through hearings such as this, passes new legislation to strengthen\nlaw enforcement's reach and victims' legal recourse, gives the President sanctions authority,\nand advances security measures to protect against these activities. Yet, as important as they\nare, more robust security programs, awareness training, FOCI regulations, diplomatic\ndemarches and tech transfer laws alone- the current suite of our technology protection efforts\n-will never be enough to stop these massive programs of state-orchestrated technology theft.\n\nWhich brings me back to our hearing, five years ago. Toward the end, one of the Members\nasked pointedly, Isn't there a way we can _go on offense?_ Yes, I answered, there most certainly\nis- but national leadership must be willing to revamp our counterintelligence enterprise to get\nthere.\n\nToday I thought we might pick up where that conversation left off. To be sure,\ncounterintelligence is only one part of the policy mix that is needed to effectively counter illicit\ntechnology acquisition. But I have observed that the government's ability to identify and\ndisrupt foreign intelligence operations is the piece too often neglected in open discussions such\nas this ... or even within national security councils behind closed doors.\n\n7 h ttps://www. intelligence. sen ate. gov /hearings/open-hearing-worldwide-threats-hearing -1\n\nPage 3 of8\n\n\n-----\n\n45\n\nWhy is that?

Thank you, Ms. Van Cleave.\nI now recognize Mr. Daniel Golden for five minutes.\n\n**TESTIMONY OF MR. DANIEL GOLDEN,**\n**AUTHOR, SPY SCHOOLS**\n\nMr. GOLDEN. Thank you. I’d like to thank the Committee for inviting me and——\nChairman ABRAHAM. Mr. Golden, if you will push that button\nand put that mic on.\nMr. GOLDEN. Thank you. Thanks very much to the Committee\nfor inviting me. I’m delighted to be here with such distinguished\nfellow panelists. In fact, Michelle, I quote her prior congressional\ntestimony in my book Spy Schools.\nMy book examines both foreign and domestic espionage activity\nat U.S. universities, but my testimony today will focus on foreign\ntheft of federally funded academic research.\nThe number of foreign students and faculty has mushroomed\nover the past 40 years. In 2016, the number of international students at U.S. universities topped 1 million for the first time, almost\nseven times the total in 1975 and more than double the 2000 figure. And of course they were basically no Chinese students here before 1978.\nThe number of foreign-born scientists and engineers working at\nU.S. colleges and universities rose 44 percent between 2003 and\n2013, and in key technical fields like engineering and computer\nscience, American universities award more than half of their doctorates to international students.\nEducational globalization has many benefits: diverse perspectives\nin the classroom cross-cultural understanding, skilled labor for research, collaboration of the world’s best minds, and the advancement of learning. But there is an alarming side effect.\nGlobalization has transformed American universities into a frontline for espionage. Some small but significant percentage of international students and faculty come to help their countries gain recruits for clandestine operations, insights into U.S. Government\nplans, and access to sensitive military and civilian research. Academic solicitation defined as the use of students, professors, scientists, and researchers as collectors tripled from eight percent of\nall foreign efforts to obtain sensitive or classified information in fiscal year 2010 to 24 percent in 2014, according to the Defense Security Service.\nFor foreign intelligence services, a university offers a valuable\nand lightly guarded target. They can exploit the revolving door between academia and government. Today’s Professor of International Relations is tomorrow’s Assistant Secretary of State. They\ncan recruit naive students and guide them into the federal agency\nof their choice.\nAcademic research offers a vulnerable and low-risk target for foreign espionage. University laboratories are often less protected\nthan their corporate counterparts, reflecting a culture oriented toward collaboration. Typically, university researchers aren’t required to sign nondisclosure agreements, which run counter to the\nethic of openness. Open campuses also make it simple to gather intelligence. Spies with no academic affiliation can slip unnoticed\n\n\n-----\n\n51\n\ninto seminars, student centers, libraries, and cafeterias and befriend the computer scientist or Pentagon advisor sitting beside\nthem.\nAnd academia’s old-fashioned gentlemanly culture abets espionage. All it takes for professors in different countries to agree to\ncollaborate on research is a phone call, an email, or perhaps a\nhandshake at a conference. There’s not necessarily a contract that\nexplicitly spells out what data or equipment each side has access\nto. Many science students and faculty are unfamiliar with intellectual property safeguards.\nUniversity administrations largely overlook this threat in part\nfor financial and reputational reasons. They’re ramping up enrollment of full-paying international students an opening campuses\nabroad, which are often subsidized by the host countries.\nThe story of one Chinese graduate student at Duke University illustrates how vulnerable academic research is to foreign raiders\nand how little universities do to protect it. I came across this saga\nwhen, through a public records request, I obtained the agenda of\nan October 2012 meeting of the National Security Higher Education Advisory Board, which I heard today was recently disbanded. One agenda item stated that Duke University Professor\nDavid Smith, quote, ‘‘will discuss how, without his knowledge, a\nChinese national targeted his lab and published and exploited Dr.\nSmith’s research to create a mirror institute in China.’’ The episode\ncost Duke significantly in licensing, patents, and royalties, and\nkept Smith from being the first to publish groundbreaking research.\nI soon learned that Smith was a renowned researcher who had\nhelped launch the fast-growing field of meta-materials, artificial\nmaterials with properties not found in nature. His lab had invented\nthe first invisibility cloak ala Harry Potter, although it only concealed objects from microwaves, not the human eye, and that his\nlab had Pentagon funding to develop ways of making weapons invisible.\nAnd I identified the Chinese national as Ruopeng Liu, a former\ngraduate student in Smith’s lab. Through interviews with Smith\nand other lab members, I discovered that Liu had left a trail of specifics suspicious behavior, arranging for Chinese scientists to visit\nthe Duke lab and photograph its equipment, passing them data\nand ideas developed by unwitting colleagues at Duke, deceiving\nSmith into committing to work part-time in China by enlisting him\nunder false pretenses to participate in the brain-game program\ncalled Project 111 that Michael mentioned, and secretly starting a\nChinese website based on the work at Duke.\nAfter numerous warnings from other members of the lab and\nquestions from the Pentagon, Smith finally began to suspect Liu\nand took away his key to the lab, but Duke still gave him a doctorate. Liu noted in an interview for my book that the invisibility\nresearch was considered basic but the are advantages even to stealing open research, mainly saving time and avoiding mistakes. With\na mole in a U.S. university laboratory, researchers overseas can\npublish and patent an idea first, ahead of the true pioneers, and\nenjoy the consequent acclaim, funding, and surging interest from\ntop students and faculty. In fact, a foreign government may be\n\n\n-----\n\n52\n\neager to scoop up a fundamental breakthrough before its applications become so important that it’s labeled secret and foreign students lose access to it.\nUniversities should be more smarter and more sophisticated\nabout the intelligence ramifications of research collaborations, student and faculty exchanges, academic conferences, and international admissions. I’d like to see more training and courses in intellectual property rights, contractual agreements for cross-border\ncollaborations that spell out each side’s access to data and equipment, and orientation sessions for conferences on study-abroad programs that include tips on recognizing come-ons from intelligence\nagencies. And if students or alumni are exposed as foreign spies,\nuniversities should deny or revoke their degrees rather than looking the other way.\nAs Americans, we’re all concerned and rightly so about foreign\nintelligence services interfering in our elections. Like democratic\nelections, a robust, open, and intellectually curious system of higher education is a hallmark of our society we should take pains to\nprotect it as well. Thank you.\n\n[The prepared statement of Mr. Golden follows:]\n\n\n-----\n\n53\n\nHouse Science Committee testimony April !!/Daniel Golden\n\nI would like to thank the committee for inviting me. I am testifying in my personal capacity as\n\nthe author of\"Spy Schools: How the CIA, FBI, and Foreign Intelligence Secretly Exploit\n\nAmerica's Universities,\" rather than as a senior editor at Pro Publica.

Despite pursuing groundbreaking technologies for the Pentagon and the\n\nintelligence community, university laboratories are less protected than their\n\ncorporate counterparts, reflecting a culture oriented toward collaboration and\n\nprotection. Typically, university researchers aren't required to sign nondisclosure\n\nagreements, which run counter to the ethic of openness.\n\nOpen campuses make it simple to gather intelligence. Spies with no academic\n\n\n-----\n\n55\n\naffiliation can slip unnoticed into seminars, student centers, libraries, and cafeterias\n\n\naffiliation can slip unnoticed into seminars, student centers, libraries, and cafeterias\n\npretty much anywhere except laboratories conducting classified research - and\n\nbefriend the computer scientist or Pentagon adviser sitting beside them.\n\nAcademia's old-fashioned, gentlemanly culture also abets espionage. All it takes\n\nfor professors in different countries to agree to collaborate on research is a phone\n\ncall, an email, or perhaps a handshake at a conference. There's not necessarily a\n\ncontract that explicitly spells out what data or equipment each side has access to.\n\nMany science students and faculty are unfamiliar with intellectual property\n\nsafeguards. In one study, 21 percent of UCLA engineering graduate students\n\ncouldn't define a patent; 32 percent couldn't define a copyright; 51 percent\n\ncouldn't define a trademark; and 68 percent- more than two-thirds couldn't\n\ndefine a trade secret. Never contemplating the possibility of espionage, American\n\nprofessors sometimes comply with requests from acquaintances or strangers\n\noverseas for research advice, manuscript reviews, or unpublished data.\n\nUniversity administrations largely ignore the growing threat, in part for financial\n\nand reputational reasons. They're ramping up enrollment offull-paying\n\ninternational students, and opening campuses abroad, which are often subsidized\n\nby the host countries.\n\n\n-----\n\n56\n\nLike their institutions, individual professors may put global prestige ahead of\n\nintellectual property. John Reece Roth, an emeritus professor of electrical\n\nengineering at the University of Tennessee, was convicted in 2008 and sentenced\n\nto four years in prison for using graduate students from China and Iran on U.S. Air\n\nForce research that was off-limits to foreigners, and taking a laptop with restricted\n\nfiles to China.\n\nRoth wasn't a Chinese spy. He was simply proud of his renown there. He found it\n\nhard to believe that a country where two universities had named him an honorary\n\nprofessor, where his lectures drew large audiences, and where both volumes of his\n\nbook Industrial Plasma Engineering were available in translation, could have any\n\nduplicitous intent.\n\nA pivotal moment in educational globalization - and in the rise of academic spying\n\n--was China's opening to the West, and its decision in 1978 to begin sending\n\nstudents to the U.S, which was motivated largely by a desire to catch up in science\n\n\nLike their institutions, individual professors may put global prestige ahead of\n\nintellectual property.

Soon afterwards, the FBI began noticing signs of an increase in\n\ncampus spying, such as a spike in the use of copying paper.\n\nChina now accounts for almost one-third of international students in the US, and\n\n\n-----\n\n57\n\nabout 15% of foreign-born researchers and scientists. Again, the vast majority pose\n\n\nabout 15% of foreign-born researchers and scientists. Again, the vast majority pose\n\nno threat and, like other newcomers, infuse American universities with energy and\n\nfresh perspectives. Still, a study conducted for my book found that at least 30\n\npeople born or raised in China and charged since 2000 in U.S. courts with\n\neconomic espionage, theft of trade secrets and similar offenses attended American\n\ncolleges or graduate schools, including Harvard, Stanford, Columbia, and Cornell.\n\nThe story of one Chinese graduate student at Duke University illustrates how\n\nvulnerable academic research is to foreign raiders, and how little universities do to\n\nprotect it. I came across this saga when, through a public records request, I\n\nobtained the agenda of an October 2012 meeting of the National Security Higher\n\nEducation Advisory Board, which was established in 2005 as a forum for\n\nuniversity presidents and US intelligence officials to discuss matters of mutual\n\nimportance. One agenda item stated that Duke University professor David Smith\n\n\"will discuss how, without his knowledge, a Chinese national targeted his lab and\n\npublished and exploited Dr. Smith's research to create a mirror institute in China.\n\nThe episode cost Duke significantly in licensing, patents, and royalties and kept\n\nSmith from being the first to publish ground-breaking research.\"\n\nI soon learned that Smith was a renowned researcher who had helped launch the\n\nfast-growing field of meta-materials, or artificial materials with properties not\n\n\n-----\n\n58\n\nfound in nature; that his lab had invented the first \"invisibility cloak,\" though it\n\nonly concealed objects from microwaves, not the human eye; and that his lab had\n\nPentagon funding to develop ways of cloaking weapons. And I identified the\n\nChinese national as Ruopeng Liu, a former graduate student in Smith's lab.\n\nThrough interviews with Smith and other lab members, I discovered that Liu had\n\nleft a trail of suspicious behavior. He arranged for Chinese scientists to visit the\n\nDuke lab and photograph its equipment, and passed them data and ideas developed\n\nby unwitting colleagues at Duke. He deceived Smith into committing to work part\n\nfound in nature; that his lab had invented the first \"invisibility cloak,\" though it\n\nonly concealed objects from microwaves, not the human eye; and that his lab had\n\nPentagon funding to develop ways of cloaking weapons. And I identified the\n\nChinese national as Ruopeng Liu, a former graduate student in Smith's lab.\n\nThrough interviews with Smith and other lab members, I discovered that Liu had\n\nleft a trail of suspicious behavior. He arranged for Chinese scientists to visit the\n\nDuke lab and photograph its equipment, and passed them data and ideas developed\n\nby unwitting colleagues at Duke. He deceived Smith into committing to work part-\n\ntime in China by enlisting him under false pretenses to participate in a program\n\ncalled Project 111, which the Chinese government established in 2006 to spur\n\n\"scientific\" renewal of Chinese universities by recruiting famous scientists as\n\n\"overseas academic masters.\" And he secretly started a Chinese website based on\n\nthe work at Duke.\n\nTo be sure, it seems likely that Liu was poaching the research for his own benefit,\n\nrather than for Chinese intelligence. Also, he didn't explicitly broke the rules,\n\nmostly because there was no formal collaboration agreement and Duke's\n\nguidelines didn't anticipate this sort of situation. Still, his actions smacked of\n\neconomic espionage.\n\nAfter numerous warnings from other members of the lab, and questions from the\n\n\n-----\n\n59\n\nPentagon, Smith finally began to suspect Liu, and took away his key to the lab, but\n\nDuke still awarded Liu a doctorate. Coincidentally or not, a week after Liu' s\n\ndissertation defense, Duke trustees approved negotiations with Chinese officials to\n\nbuild a campus in the city of Kunshan, which would supply the land and facilities\n\nfor free. Once he had received his degree, Liu returned to China, where he used\n\nDuke's research to start a competing institute and business with Chinese\n\ngovernment support, and became a billionaire.\n\nIn an interview for my book, Liu defended himself by noting that the invisibility\n\nresearch was basic, not export-controlled or classified. \"I worked in fundamental\n\nresearch and published papers and they can be seen by anyone in the world,\" he\n\nsaid.\n\nYet there are advantages even to stealing open research: namely, saving time and\n\navoiding mistakes. With a mole in a U.S. university laboratory, researchers\n\noverseas can publish and patent an idea first, ahead of the true pioneers, and enjoy\n\nthe consequent acclaim, funding, and surge in interest from top students and\n\nfaculty. In fact, a foreign government may be eager to scoop up a fundamental\n\nbreakthrough before its applications become so important that it's labeled secret\nand foreign students lose access to it.

As Willie Sutton famously said when asked why he robbed\n\n\n-----\n\n62\n\nbanks, \"Because that's where the money is.\" While a university campus may have\n\nonly one or two professors of interest to an intelligence service, the right\n\nconference--on drone technology, perhaps, or ISIS- may have dozens.\n\nThe FBI warned American academics in 2011 to beware of conferences, citing this\n\nscenario: \"A researcher receives an unsolicited invitation to submit a paper for an\n\ninternational conference.

CRANE HASSOLD,**\n**DIRECTOR OF THREAT INTELLIGENCE, PHISHLABS**\n\nMr. HASSOLD. Thank you. Chairs Abraham and Comstock, Ranking Members Beyer and Lipinski, and Members of the Committee,\nthank you for the opportunity to appear before you today. My\nname’s Crane Hassold, and I’m the Director of Threat Intelligence\nat PhishLabs, a cybersecurity company based in Charleston, South\nCarolina. The purpose of my testimony today is to discuss my research and observations on the threat foreign actors pose to American academic institutions through the theft of research as a result\nof cyber attacks.\nFor background on who PhishLabs is and what we do, we were\nfounded in 2008, and one of our primary missions is to identify, understand, and mitigate cyber attacks where the primary attack vector is phishing. In 2017, we analyzed more than 1.3 million confirmed phishing sites and shut down more than 12,000 phishing attacks each month.\nFor more than 90 percent of targeted cyber attacks, the initial\nattack vector is phishing. Phishing is effective because it takes advantage of emotional responses that are inherent to human behavior such as fear, anxiety, and curiosity. Through phishing, threat\nactors can compromise personal and financial information, steal\ndata or intellectual property, and extort victims for financial gain.\nRelevant to today’s discussion, universities are particularly susceptible to risks associated with phishing attacks due to the sheer\nvolume of users that interact with our network. In December 2017,\nI identified a series of malicious domains hosting phishing sites,\ntargeting various universities in the United States and other countries. Unlike most other university phishing sites, these were\nuniquely crafted to mimic the login pages of university libraries.\nUsing a combination of technical analysis and open-source research, I identified hundreds of other phishing sites linked to the\nsame threat actors that had targeted other universities around the\nworld. To date, I’ve identified nearly 800 distinct phishing attacks\nlinked to this group, which we refer to by the name Silent Librarian dating back to September 2013. These attacks, which are significantly more sophisticated than most phishing attacks I’ve seen,\nhave targeted 300 different universities in 23 countries, including\n174 institutions in the United States. It is clear the universities\ntargeted by this group are not randomly selected. Targets in these\nphishing campaigns are generally prominent research technical or\nmedical universities.\nIn addition to universities, I also observed other notable nonacademic American institutions targeted by the group such as Los Alamos National Laboratory, the Electric Power Research Institute,\nand multiple major medical centers. Based on my research, the\npurpose of these attacks is to compromise university credentials\nand use those credentials to access and exfiltrate data from university resources such as academic research databases.\nI also identified one Iranian website that was used to monetize\nthe stolen credentials, which has been in operation since at least\n\n\n-----\n\n69\n\n2015 and, based on data shown from the site, has been visited\nmore than 1 million times.\nSince the beginning of my research into this group and their attacks, I have worked closely with the FBI to provide intelligence\ninto the group’s tactics and motivations. I have also partnered with\nREN–ISAC, an information-sharing clearinghouse for higher education institutions to notify targeted universities of imminent or recent phishing campaigns.\nAs referenced by a few members already, on March 23, 2018, the\nDepartment of Justice indicted nine Iranians associated with a\ncompany named the Mabna Institute. According to the indictment,\nthis group allegedly conducted phishing attacks against more than\n100,000 targets at international universities and private sector\ncompanies to steal more than 31 terabytes of academic data and intellectual property. The cost spent by American universities to procure resources compromised by the group is reportedly in excess of\n$3 billion.\nThe DOJ also alleges in the indictment that much of this malicious activity was conducted at the direction of the IRGC, one of\nthe Government of Iran’s primary intelligence collection entities.\nBased on the evidence detailed in the indictment, it is likely that\nthe Mabna Institute and Silent Librarian and are the same group.\nIt is also important to note that the indictment has not seemed\nto deter the group from continuing their malicious activities. As of\nthe date of this testimony, I’ve observed 27 new phishing sites created by the group since the indictment targeting 20 different universities, 10 of which are located in the United States.\nBased on my analysis of these attacks and conversations I’ve had\nwith members of the university security community, there are a\nrange of ways academic institutions can better prepare and respond to the cyber threats posed by malicious threat actors. Universities should accept credential phishing as a significant threat\nand focus on identifying ways to better protect their users against\nthem.\nUsers—universities should place more of a focus on fully mitigating phishing sites targeting their users rather than implementing quick responses like simply blocking access to malicious\nwebsites on an internal network that still leave open the opportunity for further compromise. And, like other institutions, universities should also invest more in security training that raises the\nawareness of students and faculty to potential cyber threats.\nThank you again for the opportunity to testify before you today,\nand I look forward to answering any questions.\n\n[The prepared statement of Mr. Hassold follows:]\n\n\n-----\n\n70\n\n\n1\n\n\n**Testimony of**\n\n**Crane Hassold**\n**Director of Threat Intelligence**\n**PhishLabs**\n\n**Before the**\n**U.S. House of Representatives**\n**Committee on Science, Space, and Technology**\n**Subcommittee on Oversight**\n**and**\n**Subcommittee on Research and Technology**\n\n**\"Scholars or Spies: Foreign Plots Targeting America's Research and Development\"**\n\n**Aprilll, 2018**\n\nChairman Abraham, Chairwoman Comstock, Ranking Members Beyer and Lipinski, and\nMembers of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today.

The purpose of my testimony is to discuss my\nresearch and observations on the threat foreign actors pose to American academic institutions\nthrough the theft of research.\n\n**An Overview of PhishLabs**\n\nPhishLabs was founded in 2008 and is a 24/7 managed security provider that protects against\nphishing attacks targeting employees and customers. Using a powerful combination of\nproprietary technology, specialized security operations, and deep threat intelligence, PhishLabs\nprovides a full range of services to detect these attacks, extract intelligence on the attack\n\n1\n\n\n-----\n\n71\n\noperations, and quickly mitigate the underlying infrastructure to stop the threat. This results in a\nreduction of risk posed by compromised systems, data breaches, and online fraud.\n\nThe vast majority of cyberattacks start by targeting and exploiting people. This is because every\norganization has people and, unlike technology, people cannot be patched to remove their\nvulnerability. To further understand the extent in which PhishLabs analyzes phishing related\ncyber threats, please consider the following over the past year:\n\nWe analyzed more than 1.3 million confirmed malicious phishing sites that resided on\nnearly 300,000 unique domains.\nWe investigated and mitigated more than 12,000 phishing attacks every month, and\nidentified the underlying infrastructure used in these attacks and shut them down.\nWe work on behalf ofleading financial institutions, social media sites, healthcare\ncompanies, retailers, insurance companies, and technology companies to fight back\nagainst phishing threats.\n\n**Why Phishing is a Persistent Problem**\n\nExploiting human vulnerabilities continues to be the most successful path for threat actors\ntargeting the assets of organizations and individuals. As organizations deploy more advanced\ntechnical security controls, cybercriminals will increasingly rely on a vulnerability that is more\ndifficult to patch the human. Phishing emails are effective because they capitalize on emotional\nresponses offered by the human psyche. Additionally, modem phishing is far more sophisticated\nthan it used to be. The attacks themselves so closely min·or the legitimate emails that even savvy\nInternet users fall victim. Threat actors are supported by a thriving cybcrcrime ecosystem of\ntools and services, enabling them to launch phishing attacks with ease and impunity. As a result,\naccording to the 2017 Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report 1, almost half of all data\nbreaches are caused by a phishing attack.\n\nEven though the methods and techniques evolve, phishing will persist as long as it is effective\nfor cybercriminals. According to the Anti Phishing Working Group (APWG), annual phishing\nvolume continues to risc 2 Over the years phishing has been deployed as the initial infection\nvector for ransomware, banking trojans, and other malware. It has been used in Business Email\nCompromise (BEC) campaigns which arc targeted email attacks that most often do not contain\nmalicious attachments, links, or exploits.

Universities are particularly\nsusceptible to risks associated with phishing attacks due to the sheer volume of users that interact\nwith the network. Additionally, higher education has not traditionally invested heavily in\nmitigation of threats posed by phishing. As long as cybercriminals are accessing what is desired,\nthreats will continue.\n\n**Silent Librarian: A Persistent Iranian Cyber Threat to American Universities**\n\nIn December 2017, I identified two separate malicious domains hosting a total of nearly two\ndozen phishing sites targeting various universities in the United States and other countries.\nGenerally, phishing sites targeting universities are presented as replicas of the university's\ngeneral login page. The phishing sites hosted on these two domains, however, were different.\nInstead of being crafted to target general university credentials, these phishing sites were\nspecifically crafted to mimic the login pages of university libraries. This unique difference\nindicated to me that the motivation of these phishing sites was significantly different that other\nuniversity-themed phishing attacks I had previously observed and caused me to begin conducting\nadditional research to better understand the purpose, scope, and characteristics of this threat.\n\nUsing a combination of technical analysis and open source research, I quickly identified\nhundreds of other phishing sites linked to the same threat actors that had previously targeted\nother universities around the world. Based on the clear threat posed by the threat actors\nresponsible for these attacks, I named the group, which is customary for significant threat groups\nin the cyber threat intelligence field, Silent Librarian. To date, I have identified nearly 800\ndistinct phishing attacks linked to this group dating back to September 2013. These attacks have\ntargeted more than 300 different universities in 23 countries, including 174 institutions in the\nUnited States.\n\nReviewing the list of targets, it is clear that they are not randomly selected. Universities targeted\nin Silent Librarian phishing campaigns are generally prominent research, technical, or medical\nuniversities. Some schools, in particular, have been targeted numerous times over the past fourand-a-half years. For example, Monash University, located in Australia, has been a popular\nSilent Librarian target. Monash has been targeted more than two dozen times by the group since\nthe beginning of2017. In addition to universities, this group has targeted notable non-academic\n\n3\n\n\nsend funds.

I have also partnered with the Research and Education Networking Information\nSharing and Analysis Center (REN-ISAC), an information sharing clearinghouse for higher\neducation institutions, to notify targeted universities of imminent or recent phishing campaigns.\n\n**Characteristics of Silent Librarian Phishing Attacks**\n\nPhishing attacks I have observed linked to Silent Librarian are incredibly sophisticated. Like a\nsignificant majority of most phishing attacks, email is the primary attack vector used by the\ngroup and the lures used to trick victims are remarkably authentic in appearance. Spelling and\ngrammar, two of the primary indicators of a malicious email, are nearly perfect. The message in\nthe lures is contextually legitimate, meaning it is an email a recipient could be reasonably\nexpected to receive. Most Silent Librarian lure emails contain spoofed sender email addresses,\nwhich make them appear as if they're coming from a legitimate source. Some of the phishing\nemails, though, have been sent from temporary Gmail addresses. A small number of lures have\neven been sent from what appear to be email accounts at various Turkish universities.\n\nEach of the Silent Librarian lures ends with a very realistic looking closing signature containing\ncontact infonnation for the target library. The information used to construct these signatures was\nlikely collected through open source research conducted by the group. In some cases, all of the\ncontact information can be found together on one wcbpage; however, some of the information is\nin different locations, indicating the actors have likely performed manual reconnaissance to\ngather the information.\n\nAt least a third of the Silent Librarian lures identified use fictitious personas to add a sense of\nauthenticity to the em ails. The names of these personas have evolved over time; however, the\ngroup has used the personas \"Sarah Miller\" and \"Susan Jackson\" frequently in recent campaigns.\nThe group also changes the names of the personas to match the location of the target university.\nFor example, a recent campaign targeting an Australian university used the persona \"Jonathon\nDixon,\" while the persona identity \"Shinsuke Hamada\" was previously used in an email lure\ntargeting a J apancse schooL\n\nOne of the most notable aspects of lures used in Silent Librarian phishing campaigns is that the\ngroup's tactics have only minimally changed over time. Outside the correction of a few minor\nspelling errors, the content of the phishing lures has remained incredibly consistent. The likely\n\n4\n\n\n-----\n\n74\n\nreason for this consistency is that the success rate of campaigns using these lures was high\nenough that there was no need for them to evolve.\n\nLike their lures, phishing sites created by Silent Librarian are very realistic. The URLs associated\nwith the phishing pages closely mirror the legitimate web addresses of the account login pages\nfor the target university libraries. Similarly, the content of Silent Librarian phishing pages is\nalmost identical to the legitimate target sites. To create such a realistic phishing page, members\nof the group likely scrape the original HTML source code from the legitimate library login page,\nthen edit the references to resources used to render the webpage (images, JavaScript, CSS, etc.)\nto point back to the original page, a common tactic among phishers.\n\nAt the beginning of 2017, the group began to obtain free SSL certificates for their phishing\npages. This emerging tactic3 exploits the general public's misunderstanding of the HTTP Secure\n(HTTPS) protocol to create more realistic-looking phishing pages. While HTTPS only indicates\nsecure communication to and from a website, poor security messaging and confusing browser\nindicators have led many web users to believe that HTTPS also means that a website is safe\nand/or legitimate 4\n\nAs a result of my research, I identified a website, Uniaccount[.]ir, that was used to sell at least\nsome of the credentials compromised in Silent Librarian phishing attacks. On the Uniaccount\nwebsite, visitors can purchase account credentials for dozens of universities around the world.\nMemberships are offered for access to variety of academic research databases and bulk access to\nthe \"best universities.\" Visitors to this site can also buy individual journal articles, ebooks, and\nstandards documents for a nominal price. This website has been in operation since at least early2015 and, based on data shown on the site, there have been more than one million visitors to the\npage.\n\n**Indictment of the Mabna Institute**\n\nOn March 23, 2018, the US Department of Justice (USDOJ) indicted nine Iranians associated\nwith a company named the Mabna Institute5 According to the indictment, this group allegedly\nconducted phishing attacks against international universities and private-sector companies to\nsteal academic data, intellectual property, and other propriety data. The indictment details how\nmore than l 00,000 accounts of professors had been targeted through the end of 2017. Nearly\n8,000 professor accounts were successfully compromised, which were used to exfiltratc a\nmassive amount of academic data, including journals, theses, dissertations, and electronic books.\n\n3 https://info.phishlabs.comlblog/quarter-phishing-attacks-hosted-https-domains\n4 https://info.phishlabs.com/blog/have-we-conditioned-web-users-to-be-phished\n5 https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/nine-iranians-chargcd-conducting-massive-cyber-theft-campaign-behalf**islamic**\n\n5\n\n\nreason for this consistency is that the success rate of campaigns using these lures was high\nenough that there was no need for them to evolve.\n\nLike their lures, phishing sites created by Silent Librarian are very realistic.

The USDOJ alleges that much of this\nmalicious activity was conducted on behalf of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC),\none of the government of Iran's primary intelligence collection entities.\n\nBased on my analysis of the details of the malicious activity outlined in the indictment, it is\nlikely that the Mabna Institute and Silent Librarian are the same group. In addition to sharing\nstrikingly similar attack techniques, an in-depth analysis of the Uniaccount website detailed\nabove indicates that it is likely administered by Mostafa Sadeghi, who was named in the\nindictment as a \"prolific Iran-based computer hacker who was an affiliate of the Mabna\nInstitute.\"\n\nIt is important to note that the indictment has not seemed to deter the group from continuing their\nmalicious activity. As of this date of this testimony, I have observed 27 new phishing sites\ncreated by the group since the indictment, targeting 20 different universities, ten of which are\nlocated in the United States.\n\n**The Impact of Phishing to American Universities**\n\nFor non-financial institutions, measuring the impact ofphishing can be difficult. Instead of being\nable to easily observe a financial loss caused by direct monetary theft, the impacts to these types\nof targets are more indirect. Much of the financial impact ofphishing attacks incurred by nonfinancial institutions is related to the costs associated with responding to and mitigating attacks,\nwhich includes customer support resources, remediation efforts, impact analysis, and legal fees.\nIn addition, phishing attacks are a significant threat to personal information, which can be used\nto facilitate additional crimes, such as identity theft and tax fraud.\n\nAs evidenced by the threat caused by the Silent Librarian campaigns, the impacts to academic\ninstitution caused by phishing attacks are even more complex. According to the USDOJ, the cost\nspent by American universities to procure and access the data and intellectual data compromised\nby the group was in excess of three billion dollars. Additionally, due to the massive amount of\ninformation sometimes exfiltrated from academic journal databases, access to these resources\nwere cut off to the entire university.\n\n**Recommendations and Solutions**\n\nBased on my analysis of these attacks and conversations I have had with members of the\nuniversity secmity community, there are a range of ways academic institutions can better prc\"Pare\nand respond to cyber threats posed by malicious threat actors. These solutions include accepting\nthe threat of credential phishing attacks, improving efforts to detect and mitigate phishing\ninfrastructure, and increasing awareness of cyber threats through security training.\n\n6\n\n\nIn total, more than 31 terabytes of data was stolen. The USDOJ alleges that much of this\nmalicious activity was conducted on behalf of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC),\none of the government of Iran's primary intelligence collection entities.\n\nBased on my analysis of the details of the malicious activity outlined in the indictment, it is\nlikely that the Mabna Institute and Silent Librarian are the same group. In addition to sharing\nstrikingly similar attack techniques, an in-depth analysis of the Uniaccount website detailed\nabove indicates that it is likely administered by Mostafa Sadeghi, who was named in the\nindictment as a \"prolific Iran-based computer hacker who was an affiliate of the Mabna\nInstitute.\"\n\nIt is important to note that the indictment has not seemed to deter the group from continuing their\nmalicious activity. As of this date of this testimony, I have observed 27 new phishing sites\ncreated by the group since the indictment, targeting 20 different universities, ten of which are\nlocated in the United States.\n\n**The Impact of Phishing to American Universities**\n\nFor non-financial institutions, measuring the impact ofphishing can be difficult. Instead of being\nable to easily observe a financial loss caused by direct monetary theft, the impacts to these types\nof targets are more indirect. Much of the financial impact ofphishing attacks incurred by non-\nfinancial institutions is related to the costs associated with responding to and mitigating attacks,\nwhich includes customer support resources, remediation efforts, impact analysis, and legal fees.\nIn addition, phishing attacks are a significant threat to personal information, which can be used\nto facilitate additional crimes, such as identity theft and tax fraud.\n\nAs evidenced by the threat caused by the Silent Librarian campaigns, the impacts to academic\ninstitution caused by phishing attacks are even more complex. According to the USDOJ, the cost\nspent by American universities to procure and access the data and intellectual data compromised\nby the group was in excess of three billion dollars. Additionally, due to the massive amount of\ninformation sometimes exfiltrated from academic journal databases, access to these resources\nwere cut off to the entire university.\n\n**Recommendations and Solutions**\n\nBased on my analysis of these attacks and conversations I have had with members of the\nuniversity secmity community, there are a range of ways academic institutions can better prc\"Pare\nand respond to cyber threats posed by malicious threat actors. These solutions include accepting\nthe threat of credential phishing attacks, improving efforts to detect and mitigate phishing\ninfrastructure, and increasing awareness of cyber threats through security training.\n\n6\n\n\n-----\n\n76\n\n_1._ _Acknowledge the Threat and Impact_\n\nGenerally, when people think of threats posed by cyber threat actors, particularly from foreign\nnation-state actors, they think of sophisticated malware-based attacks. Credential phishing\nattacks are viewed as nuisances that pose little to no risk to an organization. In most\norganizations, a significant amount of time and money is used to protect users from malicious\npayload-based attacks, less effort is placed on detecting and analyzing less technical threats, like\ncredential phishing.\n\nWhile my testimony today demonstrates the significant impact credential phishing attacks can\nhave on the academic community, these types of attacks have become more common across all\nindustries. In 2017, the number of credential phishing attacks posing as email login pages\nincreased dramatically, overtaking financial phishing attacks as the most popular targets for\ncybercriminals6. This increase was almost entirely driven by the sharp rise in the number of\nphishing attacks mimicking Microsoft Office365 pages. This shift in targeting clearly signifies\nthat cyber threat actors view credential phishing attacks as lucrative and meeting their goals.\n\nBecause these types of attacks are becoming a more popular fonn of attack and have been proven\nto be successful in previous campaigns targeting academic institutions, universities must accept\nthem as a significant threat and focus on identifying ways to better protect their users against\nthem.\n\n_2._ _Increase the Focus on Disntpting Phishing Infrastructure_\n\nBased on conversations I have had with colleagues in the academic community, it is my\nunderstanding that most universities respond to phishing attacks by simply blocking access to\nmalicious websites on their internal network. While this response can be implemented quickly,\nthis approach does not dismpt the attack and can still lead students and faculty to be\ncompromised.\n\nFirst, this response tactic assumes that all potential victims arc located on the university's\nnetwork at all times. Unfortunately, due to the transient nature of electronic communication and\nuse of mobile devices to access user email accounts, the probability that a malicious phishing\nemail is received by a student or faculty member outside of the university's internal network is\nsignificant.\n\n6 PhishLabs 2018 Phishing Trends &Intelligence Report (publication pending)\n\n7\n\n\n_1._ _Acknowledge the Threat and Impact_\n\nGenerally, when people think of threats posed by cyber threat actors, particularly from foreign\nnation-state actors, they think of sophisticated malware-based attacks.

At\nPhishLabs, one of our core services is identifying phishing sites and taking them offline through\nour partnerships with hosting providers. We focus on shutting down every step in the phishing\nattack chain to ensure that potential victims are unable to access the malicious content. As\nmentioned above, when not on the university's network, students and faculty lose the protection\nafforded from simply blocking a phishing sit internally. This exposes them to compromise\nbecause they would be able to still visit a phishing site in the absence of fully mitigating the\nmalicious infrastructure.\n\nBased the examples outlined above, universities should place more of a focus on fully mitigating\nphishing sites targeting their users rather than implementing quick responses that still leave open\nthe opportunity for account compromise.\n\n_3._ _Reduce Risk Profile Through Training and Mitigation_\n\nFighting back against phishing attacks starts with education. General security awareness training\nthat educates users on a broad range of risks is the first step in building a security vigilant\nculture. In our experience, traditional, once-a-year training is not the most effective method.\nUsers must be engaged through interactive, frequent training that educates and tests users.\nSecondly, due to the substantial risk presented by phishing, users must be conditioned to\nrecognize and report malicious emails.\n\nTo condition users phishing simulations that reflect real-world threats should be conducted on a\nfrequent basis. Immediate training should be administered if users take action as part of phishing\nsimulation, such as, clicking a link in an email or downloading an attachment. On the spot\ntraining must be short, memorable, and relevant.\n\nUniversity networks can be exposed not only by faculty and staff but also students. As ideal as it\nwould be to train everyone, it is more realistic to consider training faculty and staff at a\nminimum. As a result, employee reports of suspicious emails would enable faster detection of\nphishing attacks that make it past security controls and into user inboxes. This process however,\nrequires consistent and timely analysis of user-reported emails. Once the emails arc reported.\nthreat indicators must be fed into the existing security infrastructure to mitigate the risk. This\naction would significantly decrease the chance of others, that may not be trained, exposing the\nnetwork to threat actors. An effective program can transform people from being the most\nexploited vulnerability to a security asset.\n\nThank you again for the opportunity to testify before you today and I would be pleased to answer\nany questions.\n\n8\n\n\nSecond, this approach does nothing to disrupt the infrastructure of a phishing attack.

All of\nthe universities targeted in the Silent Librarian campaigns are generally prominent research,\ntechnical, or medical universities. Some schools in particular have been targeted numerous\ntimes over the past four-and-a-half years. For example, Monash University, located in\nAustralia, has been a popular Silent Librarian target. The university has been targeted more\nthan two dozen times by the group since the beginning of 2017. In addition to universities,\nSilent Librarian has also targeted non-academic institutions, such as Los Alamos National\nLaboratory, Electric Power Research Institute, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Ohio\nState Wexner Medical Center, and Thomson Reuters.\n\nSilent Librarian Lures\n\nOne of the notable aspects of Silent Librarian phishing campaigns is that their tactics have\nbarely changed over time. Outside the correction of a few minor spelling errors, the content\nof the phishing lures has remained incredibly consistent. The likely reason for this\nconsistency is that the success rate of campaigns using these lures was high enough that\nthere was no need for them to evolve.

We've written about how exactly you can\ndo this a bunch of times, so check out this post for an introduction.\n\nAt the same time, though, there are some things you can do right now to mitigate the threat\nof spear phishing attacks:\n\n**1) Issue guidance to faculty and students**\n\n\n-----\n\n95\n\nMost people don't think about phishing on a daily basis, and have very tittle chance of\nidentifying a sophisticated spear phishing attack based exclusively on its content. Thankfully,\nthough, there is one other way to spot malicious em ails designed to steal credentials: Links.\n\n\nMost people don't think about phishing on a daily basis, and have very tittle chance of\nidentifying a sophisticated spear phishing attack based exclusively on its content. Thankfully,\nthough, there is one other way to spot malicious em ails designed to steal credentials: Links.\n\nCredential theft campaigns rely on victims following embedded links, which take them to\nconvincing copies of the legitimate login pages they are expecting. To combat this, advise all\nfaculty and students to manually type in website URLs instead of following links in em ails.\nThat way, instead of being directed to a phishing site, they'll safely navigate to secure,\nlegitimate sites.\n\n**2) Request that suspicious emails be reported to your security team**\n\nAgain, we've written about this dozens oftimes; reported phishing emails are a thousand\ntimes better than deleted phishing em ails. It's advised that you set up a phishing-specific\nin box, and ask faculty members and students to forward any em ails they receive that seem\nsuspicious, or which ask them to follow embedded links to enter their login credentials.\nThese reported em ails can serve as an early warning mechanism, enabling you to get ahead\nof an incoming attack before it gets out of hand\n\n\n-----\n\n96\n\n###### Silent Librarian University Attacks Continue Unabated in Days Following\n Indictment\n\nPosted by Crane Hassold, Director of Threat Intelligence on Apr 5, '18\n\nFind me on:\nLinked In Twitter\n\nOn Friday, March 23, nine Iranian threat actors were\nindicted for stealing massive quantities of data from\nuniversities, businesses, and governments all over the\nworld.\n\nIf you've been following our blog (orthe news), you already\nknow the actors are associated with an organization called\nthe Mabna Institute, and are responsible for stealing more than 31 terabytes of data over the\npast four and a half years.

Thank you, Mr. Hassold.\nI thank all the witnesses for their testimony. I’m going to recognize myself for five minutes for questioning.\nMr. Wessel, Ms. Van Cleave, and Mr. Hassold, I think these\nquestions will go to you. Is it fair to say that the open and collaborative nature of U.S. academic institutions make them inherently\nvulnerable to the threat of foreign exfiltration? And if so, how do\nwe strike that balance in protecting our research and our systems\nwhile ensuring collaboration? Mr. Wessel, I’ll start with you.\nMr. WESSEL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think, as I pointed out\nin my testimony, we can identify what some of the high-value targets are and focus on those first so that we can look at critical\nareas of research that relate not only to the economic domain but\nChina’s national security desires, other countries’ national security\ndesires. One can do a gap analysis to determine whether, for example, China needs hot engine technology to be able to develop jet engines for their fighters.\nWe can then net back and look at some of those cooperative research programs, the labs here in the United States that are doing\nwork with cleared defense contractors or doing it on their own and\ntry and upscale what the systems in place are to ensure that our\nsystems are secure, to assess foreign students who are part of those\nlabs, and make sure we’re doing better analysis of their visas and\nthe connections they have, and to try and track where the information may or may not be going. So it’s threat analysis and using that\nto try and identify gaps and go forward. We also have a lot more\nto do beyond that.\nChairman ABRAHAM. Ms. Van Cleave?\nMs. VAN CLEAVE. Mr. Chairman, clearly, the academic community, as you describe it, is open and free, and value the free exchange of ideas and interaction of all peoples and that’s the way\nto advance our knowledge and understanding. Academia is very\nrich. It is very rich in creative people, it is very rich in people who\nare going to have significant relationships with other creative people throughout the country. And so from the standpoint of a foreign\nintelligence service, here’s an opportunity to do the basics of espionage. It is the opportunity to spot potential sources, to evaluate\nthose sources, to find people who know other people that can introduce them to significant potential sources. So for an espionage\nservice, is academia a great place to operate? Absolutely, it’s a\ngreat place to operate.\nMy point—my principal point to you is to say, look, yes, we need\nto have awareness. And awareness is significantly important, and\nthe more that all Americans can understand the extent to which\nthey don’t want to be taken advantage of by foreign actors, that is\nexcellent. But we have more to do as a government as well. It is\nclear to me that the advantage lies in being able to see inside of\nwhat the foreign intelligence service is after in the first place. If\nwe know who their people are and where they are and how they’re\noperating and we know they’re at this university but not that university, we have the advantage to protect ourselves and to disrupt\nwhat they’re doing much more effectively than if all of our eggs are\nin the defense basket.\nChairman ABRAHAM. Mr. Hassold, your take?\n\n\n-----\n\n105\n\nMr. HASSOLD. Thank you. I think from a traditional counterintelligence perspective, collaboration allows for things like source recruiting and things like my panelists previously have said, but\nfrom a cyber perspective, I believe that collaboration centralizes the\ninformation that’s used by universities from a research perspective\nthat allows for an inherent risk by pooling all of the data and research into one location that can be accessed by foreign adversaries. So I think from a cyber perspective it’s more of a sense of\ncentralizing the data and making the data more vulnerable for\nattackers.\nChairman ABRAHAM. All right. Thank you.\nMr. Wessel, in your testimony you stated that we needed to act\nto preserve our own technology and confront China’s predatory and\nprotectionist actions to ensure the existence of the global commons.\nHas the U.S. Federal Government taken steps to confront this at\nour academic institutions? How would you suggest we confront China’s actions? And what consequences do we take the appropriate\naction to do so?\nMr. WESSEL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Although that probably\nwould take me a day or two to respond, I don’t think we’ve done\nenough to send a message that—both to the Chinese and other nations but also to players here about the seriousness. As you probably recall, in May 2014, five PLA hackers were indicted for going\ninto a number of our major companies here, not universities but\nmajor companies. There’s no follow-up action to that. The indictment was sealed. Those five PLA hackers may not be able to come\nto Disneyland, but they’re doing quite well. So there have been few\ncosts to the Chinese or other nations for what they’re doing.\nYou talked about indictments, et cetera. There are some one-offs.\nWe have to do a much better job of identifying the critical technologies that China and other nations want and enhancing the\nsafeguards around those. And, as the President is doing now in\nterms of the theft and coercive taking of intellectual property by\nthe Chinese is make sure that there are sanctions that are effective\nand people understand that the overall framework has to change.\nSanctions to respond to the illegal activities need to be upgraded.\nThey need to be much more public. We also need to do a much better job of training those people here as to what the risks are.\nChairman ABRAHAM. Thank you. My time is up.\nMs. Esty, you’re recognized for five minutes.\nMs. ESTY. Well, thank you very much.\nAgain, I want to thank all of you for joining us here today. This\nis an extremely important topic.\nI represent Connecticut. I have Yale just to the south of me,\nUConn Medical Center to the north of me, and so these are very\nserious issues for the research institutions that I’m honored to represent.\nTo all of you, and based on the anecdotes you shared with us\nhere today, it seems like there’s a very serious lack of situational\nawareness of people in the academy. I have a husband who’s not\nin this field but has a lot of foreign students. He has grad students.\nWe increasingly in the STEM fields have—the vast majority of our\nstudents are foreign-born. We have benefited enormously by that\nopenness, but that makes us extremely vulnerable.\n\n\n-----\n\n106\n\nCan you try to drill down for us a little bit on what you think\nwe can do to raise that level of awareness within institutions that\nallows them the freedom that they are going to want to have and\nneed to have to share widely—that collaboration is important—but\nto be aware that with that openness comes a responsibility to be\nmore on guard? And I think frankly we have not been. People are\nbecoming aware of the phishing risks, but maybe not this broader\none, don’t really think that it’s possible that you might actually\nhave spies. It’s sort of not in the mindset of the academics. So how\ndo we preserve that openness but raise that awareness?\nAnd if you have thoughts of appropriate ways for us to do that,\nI think it’s really important because it’s not always laws that we\nneed to be passing. A lot of times it’s actually helping people do the\nright thing and being aware of what the risks are. Thank you.\nMr. GOLDEN. I’ll mention one or two things. Intellectual property\ncourses are, at most universities, confined to law schools, so there’s\ngenerally not access for, you know, science students to take them,\nand, as a result, studies have shown that relatively few graduates\nin fields like engineering or the sciences understand concepts like\nwhat is a trade secret. So I think having those kind of courses or\ntraining more broadly.\nAnd the other point I’d make is that, you know, universities have\nsecurity people and research security people, but they tend to be,\nyou know, dependent on professors and people in the classroom to\nreport something that they see that might, you know, seem amiss.\nAnd, you know, in fact one case that did happen that I looked\nat in my book where there were two scholars visiting Boston from\na university in China that’s partly run and funded by China’s intelligence ministry and the scholars were just kind of visiting all\nthese different universities. They didn’t really have an office at\nUMass Boston; they were just dropping in wherever they felt like\nit, the Northeastern research security people got a tip and, you\nknow, recognized that we better monitor what these two people are\ndoing. So—but they’re dependent on professors and grad students\nto let them know, and so training or understanding would be of\ngreat benefit there.\nMs. ESTY. Does anyone have courses already developed and is\nthat something you could maybe—may be that’s something that\nneeds to be done to do a mini course. Having been a law student,\na lot of law students don’t take intellectual property courses, so I\nthink you’re going to need to have something that’s a mini version\nthat’s accessible to people but to realize that these things have real\nvalue. You have a responsibility to safeguard it, and that’s part of\nyour basically fiduciary duty as a researcher and as a student to\nbe aware of that. And that if you see something, say something notion. I think there’s a lot of times people don’t know. And something may strike them as a little odd but they don’t realize like\nthat could mean something.\nAnd so maybe that’s something you can follow up with us with\nsome suggestions about developing curricula and things that we\ncould try to get help from the National Science Foundation and\nothers to work with our research institutions large and small to\nhave them be more aware of these are the kinds of things you\nmight see and you should be equipping your faculty to be aware\n\n\n-----\n\n107\n\nbecause, again, I think we’re concerned about clamping down on\nacademic freedom, and so this may lend itself to awareness at the\nvery least. So——\nMr. GOLDEN. Definitely. I’d be glad to.\nMs. ESTY. Well, thank you. I appreciate that. And I see my time\nis almost up. Thank you, and I yield back.\nMr. WESSEL. If I could just add quickly because it’s been noted\nby you, Mr. Chairman, and others that much of this research is\nfederally funded. It’s our—your constituents’ tax dollars. There can\nbe ties to that with the universities to make sure they are putting\nin place the kind of counterintelligence and other systems and education in place to make sure that their professors, their researchers, their students have a better understanding of what the threat\nfactors are.\nChairman ABRAHAM. Thank you. Mrs. Comstock?\nMrs. COMSTOCK. Thank you.\nThe Iran case demonstrates that nefarious foreign actors use\ncyber means to access valuable research and development, and numerous case studies in China, as was detailed, reveal that human\nintelligence is used to gain access. And the FBI has recognized two\nmethods: seeding operations and recruitment operations. So could\nyou discuss, any of you, any specific cases that fall into each of\nthese and the methods or means utilized by the foreign agents to\naccess and exfiltrate valuable R&D?\nMs. VAN CLEAVE. Well, I suspect Dan has a long list of particular\ncases that he can cite, but I just want to confirm that those methodologies, as well as others, are used systematically by foreign intelligence services not only on our campuses but, you know, elsewhere in the country to go after the things that they are interested\nin. And it isn’t casual. Sometimes there’s a misunderstanding that,\nyou know, maybe it’s just a casual undertaking. That’s not the\ncase.\nChina, for instance, and Russia as well, have very sophisticated,\nwhich is to say highly developed, acquisition strategies for where\nthey’re going, the things that they want, how they’re going to get\nthem. The cyber opportunities certainly are tremendous now, but\nold-fashioned espionage is still very much a part of these activities.\nAnd what that says to me as a counterintelligence professional is\nthat we have an opportunity. If we can gain the intelligence insights into what they’re doing and how they’re doing it, then we\nhave the chance to get inside of those operations in order to be able\nto degrade them or stop them or better protect ourselves.\nSo whether it’s cyber operations that would influence our democratic institutions and processes or whether it’s espionage, going\nafter our national security secrets or our laboratories or the research activities in academia, getting inside of those operations\ngives us the advantage. And that’s where we’ve been falling short.\nMrs. COMSTOCK. Okay. And are these actors being recruited and\nthen sent to the United States to infiltrate in some way when it’s\nactual people or are they being recruited by other—you know, here\ntrying to get—what is the recruitment process when it’s human intelligence?\nMs. VAN CLEAVE. All of the above.\nMrs. COMSTOCK. Right.\n\n\n-----\n\n108\n\nMs. VAN CLEAVE. Again, it looks at where are the opportunities,\nso you——\nMrs. COMSTOCK. They target—they go for what they want to access first——\nMs. VAN CLEAVE. Right.\nMrs. COMSTOCK. —and they build the plan——\nMs. VAN CLEAVE. Right.\nMrs. COMSTOCK. —around that?\nMs. VAN CLEAVE. So put yourself in their place. So if you are a\nChinese Government entity that is looking to develop next-generation ASAT capability and you know that these specific kinds of\ntechnologies are the subject of research at particular universities\nhere or in laboratories, what do you want to do? You want to be\nable to get close to the people who are close to that. You want to\nfind other ways in to try to acquire these technologies, and so\nyou’re going to use all of the means at your disposal in order to do\nthat. But it isn’t casual. You’re very serious about your objectives,\nand you know that this works quite well. The Russians, the same.\nThey used to build in—and they probably still do—the acquisition\nof Western technologies into their design plans for weapons systems. They knew they could get what they needed here, and so that\nwould be part of their planning activity. So that very much is still\ngoing on.\nMrs. COMSTOCK. Thank you. Mr. Golden?\nMr. GOLDEN. I could speak to this issue a little bit. I could give\nyou any number of cases. They’re not always where the government directly sends somebody or recruits somebody. As Michael\nmentioned, China has these very aggressive brain-game programs\nthat provide incentives for particularly researchers in the United\nStates of Chinese descent to come home and—with research that\nthey might not have come by honestly. And those programs have\nnot succeeded in recruiting sort of tenured professors at top-notch\nAmerican institutions. They don’t really want to go back to China\nno matter what the offer is. So they tend to appeal to sort of fringe\nprofessors at lesser institutions, maybe they don’t have tenure, and\nthe message to them is kind of don’t come home empty-handed. So\nthere’s kind of an incentive for them to bring something back.\nThere was a case involving a research assistant at Medical College of Wisconsin. Hua Jun Zhao, he basically—his professor had\ninvented kind of a cancer-fighting compound, and he applied for\none of these brain-game programs saying that he was the inventor.\nAnd the application he sent was basically a duplicate of a grant\nproposal that his professor had filed. So there’s that kind of case.\nIn the Duke case I mentioned, it’s not clear if Ruopeng Liu was\nactually working for the Chinese Government. More likely, he was\non his own knowing, that this would be welcomed when he got\nhome. You know, and in fact it was. He got heavily subsidized by\nthe government and he set up a business and an institute, you\nknow, but it still kind of, you know, theft of an American research\nthat he was enterprising enough to go after essentially.\nMrs. COMSTOCK. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nChairman ABRAHAM. Thank you, Mrs. Comstock.\nMr. Beyer, five minutes.\n\n\n-----\n\n109\n\nMr. BEYER. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. And look, before I dive into this, I just want to take a moment to again implore\nthis committee to provide oversight to EPA Administrator Pruitt.\nAdministrator Pruitt’s alleged unethical behavior, his wasteful use\nof taxpayer money, his ongoing efforts to undermine the EPA’s mission to protect our environment and our public health, this warrants serious Congressional oversight.\nI previously requested that Chairman Smith bring Administrator\nPruitt before the Science Committee to testify as to standard practice, and now, amid daily and abundant scandals, this is more crucial than ever.\nAdministrator Pruitt’s predecessor, Gina McCarthy, Mr. Chairman, as you know well, testified before this committee again and\nagain and again, once just on text messages to her husband. Administrator—in contrast, Administrator Pruitt has been confirmed\n14 months ago and he has yet to appear before the committee that\nhas oversight. He cannot be allowed to continue to sell our nation’s\nclean air and water to special interests without consequences even\nwithout our questions.\nAnd if the President refuses to hold him accountable, then Congress has to do its job. Science, Space, and Technology Committee\nneeds to do its job and conduct meaningful oversight.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman, for that digression.\nMr. Golden, your book gives lots of examples about how foreign\nintelligence agencies especially from China attempt to use various\nmethods to obtain sensitive research and technical information\nthrough the use of human sources, spies. Given the increasing\npower of digital tools to wage cyber warfare and collect colossal\namounts of data, for example, Mr. Zuckerberg, who’s over at the\nHouse Energy and Commerce Committee this morning, why do foreign intelligence agencies need human resources at all anymore?\nMr. GOLDEN. Thank you. That’s a good question and I don’t have\na definitive answer, but I think that cyber and human intelligence\ngathering should be seen as complementary rather than sort of as\nin competition. I mean, there are insights you can gain, secrets you\ncan find out that are not necessarily in the digital world so that,\nyou know, there’s a certain body of information that cyber and data\nhacking or gathering is vital to gain, but there’s still, you know,\nmany things that people don’t, you know, confide to email, don’t\nput down in writing, and can be gained by recruiting a source. And\nother things can also be done by human intelligence but not by\ncyber. For example, recruiting a graduate student and steering him\nto apply for a job in a given federal agency is not something that\nyou can do with a cyber attack, you know?\nMr. BEYER. Do you see any difference in the trade craft, for example, between China and Russia?\nMr. GOLDEN. I’m not sort of an expert more broadly beyond academia, but I would say that the China—most of the examples you\nfind in China or most of what I’ve learned have to do often with\ntargeting research, and the Russian examples more often have to\ndo with seeking political or economic secrets.\nMr. BEYER. Thank you very much.\nMr. Wessel, in your testimony you talked about the National Security Higher Education Advisory Board created in 2005. And we\n\n\n-----\n\n110\n\nlearned earlier the FBI disbanded it. Do you think when it existed\nthat it served a useful function, and how important is it to have\nthis regular communication between the law enforcement intelligence communities on the one hand and the academic communities on the other?\nMr. WESSEL. I think that is vital and it should be reinstated, and\nI think we need to find other ways of communicating and collaborating with our universities, especially, again, those with highvalue targets—that are high-value targets. There are lists of those\nuniversities that are engaged in classified research as it relates to\ndefense contracts, et cetera. There are some critical areas of cutting-edge research that we view as the future of America’s economy\nand our success. And the collaboration is vital. If we view the academic institutions as a principal threat vector, the government\nneeds to be doing much more to make sure that our universities\nare playing their role.\nMr. BEYER. To continue—thank you, Mr. Wessel—you suggested\nthat the Confucius Institute, their personnel should be required to\nregister as foreign agents under the Foreign Agents Registration\nAct. How does the Confucius Institute differ from the GoetheInstitut, the British Institute, Alliance Francaise?\nMr. WESSEL. I can’t say that I know all of those other entities,\nso I’m not sure I’m qualified to answer other than the Confucius\nInstitutes have a very clear role in extending China’s soft power at\na time when we find them to be challenging us on many fronts\nboth in terms of such issues as the South China Sea and geopolitical issues but also again militarily and economically. So with\nmy work on the China Commission, that’s what I focus on, not\nwhat some of the other countries are doing, so I’ll have to get back\nto you on that.\nMr. BEYER. Okay. All right.\nMr. GOLDEN. I could speak to the—that issue a little bit.\nMr. BEYER. Mr. Golden, only if the Chair—the new Chair—perhaps we will cycle back to it because my time is up.\nMr. GOLDEN. It’s okay.\nMr. BEYER. Thank you very much.\nMr. HIGGINS. [Presiding] Thank you. And the Chair—my Chairman has excused himself for a moment, so I’m going to recognize\nmyself for five minutes of questioning.\nMs. Van Cleave, just to clarify for the American people whom we\nserve, we’re understanding today, and based upon research of myself and my colleagues prior to this hearing, that the American people are funding, through university grants, the Federal Government harvests treasure from the American people to fund university grants that go to research and development programs at our\nuniversities. Those research and development programs designed to\nenhance the economic strength of America and the military might\nof America, the predominance of American university-level research, and that research is being stolen and harvested by foreign\nnationals and brought to their own nations in order to give those\nnations predominance, as paid for by the American people. So essentially the American people are funding the predominant position of foreign nations, is that correct?\nMs. VAN CLEAVE. Very well put, Mr. Chairman.\n\n\n-----\n\n111\n\nMr. HIGGINS. Let me ask you, regarding university grant applications for research and development, do those applications include\nany verification of policies or procedures that are in place at that\nuniversity to protect intellectual properties and to confirm that\nthey have cybersecurity systems in place and even general security\nsystems in place? Does a grant application right now include any\nsort of confirmation that that university has the ability or even the\nintent to protect the research and development that we would fund\nthrough that grant?\nMs. VAN CLEAVE. Certainly through classified research grants, I\nknow very careful restrictions like that are in place. I think some\nof my other panelists can speak to open grants.\nMr. HIGGINS. Comment?\nMr. WESSEL. Just——\nMr. HIGGINS. Mr. Wessel?\nMr. WESSEL. Just as it relates to nonpublic meaning, you know,\nwhen a pharmaceutical company goes to a research institute for\ncollaborative research on, you know, cancer drugs, et cetera, there\nare extensive documents about what security measures they may—\nthey must put in place, nondisclosure agreements, et cetera. My\nunderstanding is for a number of federal programs that does not\nexist.\nMr. GOLDEN. When research is export-controlled, you know, then\nit’s limited to certain countries so students need approval and some\nthat can’t get approval sometimes. Basic research, I don’t think\nthere’s many security provisions, although on the Duke case I mentioned, when they then published an article that showed that some\nof the funding was from the Chinese Government on this invisibility research, you know, the Pentagon funders got upset and contacted the professor and—who put a—who ended that, so there are\nsome monitoring there.\nMr. HIGGINS. Thank you for those answers. In my opinion, to my\ncolleagues I suggest that grant applications should include some\nverification of the levels of training and awareness that we are certainly highlighting today.\nMr. Hassold, through your work, you found that at least 144 universities were breached by Iranian hackers over the last five years.\nThese hackers took 31 terabytes—that’s my understanding—31\nterabytes of R&D-related materials. Were these universities being\ntargeted specifically because of the research conducted there?\nMr. HASSOLD. So those numbers came from the DOJ indictment.\nThe numbers that I have found is 174 American universities that\nhave been targeted by this group. The firsthand observations I’ve\nbeen able to see is that the purpose of that targeting was to get\naccess to the centralized academic databases that most American\nand most Western universities have access to to exfiltrate research\narticles from those databases. Of course, the—one of the clear indications based on the targets that have been selected in those attacks is the possibility that research specific to certain universities\nis exfiltrated. When you look at some of the targets, some of the\nhigh-profile targets that the U.S. Government works with, there’s\nthat possibility. I think that’s hinted at in the indictment but that\nis secondhand information that I have.\n\n\n-----\n\n112\n\nMr. HIGGINS. And do you agree that universities should provide\nproper training for their professors, researchers, and staff to defend\nagainst cyber threats? Do you agree with that assessment?\nMr. HASSOLD. Absolutely 100 percent.\nMr. HIGGINS. I would suggest to my colleagues that today’s hearing has made clear the extent to which our nation’s research and\ndevelopment is targeted and exposed, and witness testimony confirms this threat is real. We must ensure that universities are taking this threat seriously and understand the precautions being\ntaken to safeguard their equities. I believe we would greatly benefit\nas a nation by hearing from our universities on this matter, and\nI hope this committee continues to take action on this issue.\nMy time is expired. The Chair recognizes Ms. Bonamici from Oregon for five minutes.\nMs. BONAMICI. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and thanks\nto the Chairs and the Ranking Members and our witnesses for testifying today. I appreciate the concerns of course that were raised\nin the testimony and by our colleagues, but I also want to acknowledge the immense benefits economically, socially, and academically\nof welcoming foreign students to our academic institutions. This is\nabout finding the right balance.\nWhen informed of this hearing, my alma mater, the University\nof Oregon, was proud to point out that they have long sought international students not only for the intellectual and cultural diversity they bring but also for the opportunity to encourage American\nstudents to be more globally aware and engaged. With that in\nmind, I hope our focus today can be finding that appropriate balance to make sure that our universities are secure and vigilant but\nalso accessible hubs of learning and creative exchange.\nAnd I want to thank Ranking Member Beyer for asking about\nthe National Security Higher Education Board. It seems that that\nis something that we could work on together to make sure that\nthat is reconvened and operating because I know it’s been beneficial to universities in my home State and across the country.\nThat’s been a useful venue for the academic and security communities to discuss those challenges.\nI wanted to ask, we know that there are many American students who study abroad and academics as well working abroad who\ncould be vulnerable to recruitment or unwitting involvement in espionage by a foreign actor. So could any of you describe what, if\nanything, we’re doing to protect and prepare our students, professors, and researchers from being exploited when they are abroad?\nMr. Golden, you look like you are turning on your microphone.\nMr. GOLDEN. Good observation. The—thanks. You know, there’s\none renowned case in this field of Glenn Duffie Shriver who had\nbeen a student at Grand Valley State and soon after he graduated\nhe went to China—he went to China first in college in a studyabroad program and right after—and was recruited by Chinese intelligence and they—you know, they paid him to take the foreign\nservice exam but he failed and then they paid him to try and enter\nthe CIA and he was caught and imprisoned. And the FBI made a\nvideo about it called Game of Pawns and——\nMs. BONAMICI. Widely panned I might——\n\n\n-----\n\n113\n\nMr. GOLDEN. Yes, it wasn’t that well-received but it also—you\nknow, they tried to get universities to show it in their orientations\nfor study-abroad programs, and the universities, a lot of them objected. They felt they had limited orientation time. There’s a lot of\nthings to orient the students about, you know, local conditions,\nwhat do you do if you’re ill, stay away from drugs, whatever, and\nso most of them did not show it. Now that might have been a good\ndecision on aesthetic grounds, but, you know, there probably could\nbe some, you know, discussion of some kind of orientation for students before they go overseas, as well as for the professors——\nMs. BONAMICI. Right.\nMr. GOLDEN. —who lead those trips and because they are, you\nknow, playing in the other country’s territory and they are potential targets.\nMs. BONAMICI. I believe that was back in 2014 that video was\nmade. That could be something that we could discuss as well to\nmake sure that there is something meaningful.\nLast December, the White House released its national security\nstrategy that indicated that the Trump Administration plans to\nconsider restrictions on foreign STEM students from designated\ncountries to ensure that intellectual property is not transferred to\nour competitors. Mr. Golden, you were quoted in an Inside Higher\nEducation article responding to when FBI Director Christopher\nWray testified, and you said, quote, ‘‘The vast majority of Chinese\nstudents are just here to learn and maybe do research and they\nbring energy and intelligence and fresh perspective to American\nhigher education. They’re quite valuable. It would be wrong and\nunfair to assume that some very large proportion of them are here\nfor clandestine purposes.’’ And I appreciate that, and again, this is\nabout finding the balance.\nCan you talk about the concerns or the problems that might\ncome from casting an entire group of students, researchers, and\nprofessors from a particular country as a danger to national security based on that country of origin, and how might that hinder our\nability to attract the brightest minds around the world to study,\nconduct research, and work here in the United States?\nMr. GOLDEN. Sure. Yes, in general, the globalization of higher\neducation I think is a wonderful thing, and the advantages outweigh the drawbacks. And the students from China and other\ncountries, they come and, you know, many of them are extremely\nbright and wonderful researchers and contribute to research done\nin the United States. And in fact, you know, the great majority—\nalthough the percentage has gone down some, the great majority\nwho come over as graduate students or get their doctorates here\nstay here for, you know, at least five to ten years after or make\ntheir whole careers here. And then, you know, the research they\ndo, you know, redounds the benefit to the United States rather\nthan China.\nI mean, particularly since Tiananmen Square, that’s been the\ncase. And if you look at it in that light, China almost has—you\nknow, they’re losing so much talent that that’s why they’re having\nthese aggressive brain-drain programs and that’s why they feel\nprobably pressure to use espionage because, you know, so many of\ntheir best and brightest are making their greatest discoveries in\n\n\n-----\n\n114\n\nthe United States for the benefit of American universities and the\nAmerican economy and the American Government.\nSo, you know, I think it would be a mistake to, you know, turn\noff the faucet of bringing Chinese students to this country, and instead, that’s why we ought to look for more—other things such as,\nas I mentioned, intellectual property classes, more collaboration\nagreements that spell out what can and can’t be done on each side\nand those kinds of things because, you know, foreign students contribute a great deal to the United States in any number of ways.\nMs. BONAMICI. Thank you. I see my time is expired, but as I\nyield back, I want to note that there have been several topics here\nthat we could work on on a bipartisan basis to make sure that\nwe’re protecting our universities and our data. And thank you very\nmuch. I yield back.\nMr. HIGGINS. I thank my colleague.\nAnd Mr. Loudermilk from Georgia is recognized for five minutes\nfor questions.\nMr. LOUDERMILK. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I agree with\nMs. Bonamici. This is something that should be bipartisan. It is\nsomething definitely concerning to me, and it should be to not only\nevery member of this committee but Congress and those in the universities. This is a meeting of two areas of which I have experience\nand a great interest working in intelligence and technology in the\nAir Force.\nI was greatly concerned when it was mentioned that Sandia Labs\nhas been a target. Working with Sandia Labs in the past I know\nthe type of research and development they do, and it is definitely\nof a national security concern with me and even with other research institutions that I work with in this capacity and that I\nhave in my 20 years in the IT sector. This is an area that should\nhave much more attention than we are giving it right now.\nAnd, Mr. Golden, I want to congratulate you. There is a waiting\nlist for your book at the Library of Congress, which I am on, so apparently it is beginning to grow.\nMr. Hassold, as you’ve mentioned, you’ve conducted extensive\nwork on the Iranian breach at these institutions and provided the\nFBI with your findings. Can you walk us through how the Iranians\nwere able to breach these university systems?\nMr. HASSOLD. Sure. So with any phishing attack, it always starts\nwith the lure that is generally email-based. All of these attacks\nwere—had email-based lures. So they were sent out to a number\nof different students and faculty. Some were very targeted, as is\nreferenced in the indictment from a couple weeks ago. Some were\nmore general, sent to a wider range of students and faculty. When\nyou look at those lures, they are incredibly sophisticated. The spelling, grammar, the things that you traditionally look for to identify\npotentially malicious emails, everything there has been perfect.\nAnd one of the—I think the interesting and notable aspects of\nthem is that they have barely evolved over time. If you look at a\nlure from three years ago, I had—I found a lure from three years\nago that targeted American University, and I found another lure\ntargeting an Australian university just 3 or 4 months ago. The content of those emails were exactly the same. And I think one of the\n\n\n-----\n\n115\n\ninteresting parts of that is sort of it denotes the probable success\nrate that the threat actors had with using those lures.\nSo the lures were very sophisticated. They—if you look at some\nof the information that was contained within them, it’s clear that\nthey did probable manual reconnaissance to collect information\nthat is targeted to the university specifically that makes them more\npersuasive. From the lures, you go to the phishing sites themselves. The content of the phishing sites is a near replica of the legitimate login pages that someone would see if they’re going to the\nactual site. The URLs were patterned to look extremely similar to\nthe actual login page. And then after someone enters information\ninto those phishing pages, they would generally be sent off to what\nwe would call a drop email account, which is generally a temporary\nemail account where the compromise credentials are received.\nMr. LOUDERMILK. Okay. And if we could bring up—I’ve got a couple of slides—screenshots of the landing page.\n\n[Slide.]\n\n\n-----\n\n116\n\n\n-----\n\n117\n\nMr. LOUDERMILK. The one on the top is the actual University of\nPennsylvania library page. Actually, the top one is the phishing\nsite. I’m correct—corrected, and at the bottom is the actual. This\nis incredible. I mean, this is highly sophisticated. It indicated to\nme, looking at this, that this is not just a rogue actor. This has\nstate sponsorship. There is a lot of work gone into this, which, from\nthe technology standpoint or an IT standpoint, you’re only going to\nput this type of effort to go after a highly valued target and—which\nis really concerning.\nAnd based on your experience with this and the other work that\nyou’re doing, how vulnerable are these institutions as compared to,\nlet’s say, our business community or corporations? Are they more—\nis academia more vulnerable or less?\nMr. HASSOLD. I think one of the primary vulnerabilities for the\nacademic community is not that—is not that different than the—\nthan most other industries and most other businesses. I think the\nchallenge, as I said in my testimony, is that you have a number\nof different components that feed into the university network. You\nhave students, you have faculty, and then you have employees—\nMr. LOUDERMILK. Right.\nMr. HASSOLD. —and each of those need to have awareness and\ntraining. And by nature of the academic community, a lot of those\nmembers are transient, so the ability to train them and give them\nlike fully—a full awareness of the actual risks is much more challenging than some other businesses where most of the employees\nare sort of centralized and you have a better opportunity to train\nthem.\nMr. LOUDERMILK. Are they a softer target? And then a lot of\ntimes we look at often more effort is put into going after—well, if\nyou have two targets of high-value, you’re going to put more effort\nin the softer target than the harder. Are the universities a softer\ntarget than, let’s say, the corporations because of the—what you\njust laid out for us?\nMr. HASSOLD. I think that they hold sort of like—sort of like you\nmentioned, they hold specific value to the people who are targeting\nthem, so I don’t think they are softer and the technical defenses\nare that much worse than general businesses, but I think they hold\na certain value to the people who are targeting them that’s much\ndifferent than you look at the reasons that generally—general businesses are being targeted.\nMr. LOUDERMILK. Okay. I do have several other questions but I\nsee my time is expired, so if we do a second round or if somebody\nelse yields any, I’ll have a couple other questions for you.\nWith that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.\nMr. HIGGINS. I thank my colleague.\nAnd Mr. Lipinski from Illinois is recognized for five minutes for\nquestions.\nMr. LIPINSKI. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nAnd I want to thank the Chairman and Ranking Member for\nholding this hearing. Certainly this is a very important issue. I\nhave been very outspoken about the theft of intellectual property,\nespecially by Chinese actors, but others around the world. It’s a\ngreat threat to our economic security. I, though, think that we need\n\n\n-----\n\n118\n\nto make sure that we’re using a scalpel and not an ax to this problem.\nI appreciate Mr. Golden’s comments about the value of having\nforeign nationals come to study here in the United States. So many\nChinese have come here, as you mentioned, Mr. Golden, and have\ncontributed to the United States not just both research-wise and\nalso in regard to helping economically our nation.\nAs an academic, I understand that, you know, my impression is\nthat there is a lot more that can be done in order to make sure\nthat our academic researchers are aware of the threats that are out\nthere, nothing that I was doing—when I was doing my research\nwas—would’ve been of interest to anyone economically for espionage, but—or for any reason like that, but I know Mr. Golden had\nmentioned a few things that you think should be done to improve\nsecurity at universities and awareness by professors and students\nof potential intelligence threats they face.\nI want to know if there’s anything else that any of our panelists\nwanted to add that can be done that you think universities should\nbe doing, and is there any way to encourage universities to do more\nof improving awareness of faculty members, staff, and students at\nuniversities? Ms. Van Cleave?\nMs. VAN CLEAVE. Congressman, I understand that within the 56\nfield offices of the FBI one of their responsibilities is to be able to\nwork with universities within their jurisdictions to be able to raise\nawareness. So to have good relations between the field offices of the\nFBI and the universities is something where one would encourage\nuniversity leadership to take advantage of that kind of awareness\nopportunity that the Bureau represents, and we’ve asked them to\ntake on the job.\nBut I’d also like to interject something to sort of round out the\npicture here. We’ve talked about the value—the extraordinary\nvalue of having international students here on our campuses, and\nit’s good for us, it’s good for our student population, it’s good for\nAmerica generally to have them here. And we’ve also said it’s good\nfor the foreign students who come here. Their lives are enriched,\nand especially those who are coming from countries that may be\nclosed or may not have our freedoms and liberties.\nAnd we are welcoming them here and showing them perhaps a\ndifferent way, a new way of life, which leads me to interject this:\nThe foreign intelligence presence on our universities is not limited\nto trying to develop sources or trying to access our research. There\nis yet a third purpose behind their presence on our university campuses. For some countries that purpose is to enforce their security\nconcerns about their foreign nationals who are present there. So\nlook at it from the standpoint of those young students who may be\nhere experiencing new things, while at the same time, they know\nthey’re being watched. And that is something that I find to be troubling. So I think we should be also aware of that purpose of the\nforeign intelligence presence on our universities.\nMr. GOLDEN. That’s actually—I think Michelle makes a very\ngood point there because there’s always—there’s been a feeling at\nseveral universities I think that in some classes Chinese students\nmay be afraid to speak candidly for fear that other students are\nkeeping an eye on them and reporting back. You know, and there’s\n\n\n-----\n\n119\n\nbeen recent publicity about—I think it’s called the Chinese Student\nand Scholars Association and its connection to the Chinese Embassy. And I spoke to Derek Bok, the former President of Harvard,\nfor my book and he said that a professor at Harvard Law School\nat one point had come to him and said Chinese students were telling them they couldn’t speak candidly in class because of that fear.\nAnd Harvard tried to figure out what it could do about it and\ncouldn’t come up with anything.\nMr. LIPINSKI. Well, I was going to ask, what can be done about\nthat?\nMr. GOLDEN. Yes, he said they just didn’t have the capacity to\ntry and investigate that on their own. Harvard didn’t know what\nto do, so I don’t think they did much of anything. But it is another\nconcern of students feeling like they don’t have the freedom to\nspeak up.\nMr. LIPINSKI. And anyone else, any suggestions, recommendations, incentives that we could give to universities to make sure\nthat they are, you know, paying attention to all of these issues?\nMr. HASSOLD. I think one of the things that—one of the focuses\nis—that we talked about today is cooperation between universities\nand law enforcement. I think there also needs to be more cooperation between universities themselves. Mr. Beyer earlier brought up\nREN–ISAC, which is an absolutely fantastic resource that universities have access to. It’s very much a centralized repository of\nknowledge specifically for cyber attacks targeting universities. As\nI understand it, I’ve gotten to know the folks over there pretty well\nover the course of my research. Their operational team is only\nabout a half dozen people at this point, and they handle about, you\nknow, a couple hundred institutions. Those types of entities are—\nwould be much more valuable to the university as a whole so they\nunderstand what’s going on, targeting other universities and not\njust what’s going on targeting their own university.\nMr. LIPINSKI. Very good. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman,\nfor the extra time.\nMr. HIGGINS. I thank my colleague, and I recognize Mr. Marshall\nfrom Kansas for five minutes for questioning.\nMr. MARSHALL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My first question is\nfor Ms. Van Cleave.\nMs. Van Cleave, I’m a freshman Congressman, and one of my\njobs is trying to prioritize and figure out how big problems are.\nThere’s plenty of problems for us to solve. You know, our trade deficit was a $575 billion problem. I’ve been told that this intellectual\ntheft may be worth $500 billion, $1 trillion. Can you kind of put\na number to it or just a wild guess on how much is this impacting\nour country every year?\nMs. VAN CLEAVE. So the Intellectual Property Commission headed up by Admiral Blair and Ambassador Huntsman first met in\n2013 and issued a landmark report. They updated it just last year,\nand their estimate is $510 billion roughly in intellectual property\ntheft in the last year.\nMr. MARSHALL. And all that could basically buy down our trade\ndeficit. That’s amazing.\nI think I’ll go to Mr. Wessel next. Mr. Lipinski talked about\nusing a scalpel. I would talk about using a laser. If you were to\n\n\n-----\n\n120\n\nfocus on the companies that are the bad actors, the cheaters, the\npeople that are basically robbing our banks, what are we doing now\nto punish them? What could we do? Why aren’t we punishing these\npeople that are trying to steal—and stealing the bigger companies?\nIs anything happening?\nMr. WESSEL. There are some things happening at—you know,\nthe problem, as identified by the Commission and many others is\nongoing and, you know, there’s no way to get your hands around\nit all the time. But the failure to have significant ongoing sanctions\nhas sent a message that much of what goes on you can get away\nwith.\nYou may recall that President Xi and President Obama signed a\nmemorandum of understanding on the use of cyber espionage for\neconomic gain. The problem was that the Chinese don’t view economic gain as, you know, a separate inbox on the President’s desk.\nEconomic and national security are inextricably intertwined. So\npart of the problem is making sure we define the issue, we have\ncoherent responses, and that there are real sanctions and costs for\nwhat happened.\nI mentioned earlier about the indictments of the five PLA hackers for going into five U.S. companies, Westinghouse, a number of\nothers. The indictment was sealed. There’s been no follow-up action.\nMr. MARSHALL. And when you say sanctions, can we do sanctions\njust on companies rather than entire countries?\nMr. WESSEL. Yes, you can. I mean, we’ve had—there—in those—\nthat situation there was a tasking, meaning that certain companies\nask the Chinese Government for information or work with them to\nget it. The information was obtained through five PLA hackers and\ntransferred back to the companies. And then that was utilized. U.S.\nSteel filed a case at the ITC on this trying to have a sanction that\nwas ultimately ruled—the case was thrown out. There are ways of\nlooking at what has been taken, what has been applied in the market and sanctioning specific companies where also a broader problem that’s going to need a more general solution to.\nMr. MARSHALL. Give me an example of something that we as\nAmericans would consider intellectual theft that the Chinese\nwouldn’t, that it’s okay? That—you kind of mentioned something\nthere that I didn’t quite follow that.\nMr. WESSEL. No, when they were—after they signed the agreement, there was this view that China was going to limit its cyber\nincursions into the United States and the prohibition or the agreement was it was not going to affect economic issues. They wouldn’t\ndo it for economic gain. But China views their economic progress,\ntheir security, their growth rate as part of their national security.\nIf they can’t——\nMr. MARSHALL. So their means justifies the ends? It’s okay——\nMr. WESSEL. Correct.\nMr. MARSHALL. —to cheat as long as it benefits——\nMr. WESSEL. Correct. Their——\nMr. MARSHALL. —their national security so to speak?\nMr. WESSEL. Correct. And a different definition. They didn’t view\nit as economic espionage; they viewed it as——\nMr. MARSHALL. Yes.\n\n\n-----\n\n121\n\nMr. WESSEL. —enhancing their national security.\nMr. MARSHALL. Mr. Golden, what would you do to microfocus, to\nlaser in on the companies that are cheating?\nMr. HIGGINS. Would the gentleman turn his mic on, please?\nMr. MARSHALL. Okay.\nMr. GOLDEN. So I focused—my book is about espionage in academia and higher education——\nMr. MARSHALL. So, great. So people are espionaging intellectual\nproperty from universities. What would you do to punish them?\nWhat are we not doing? Why do we just turn her head and say it’s\nokay?\nMr. GOLDEN. Well, yes, that’s a good question Congressman, and\nI can speak to that. You’re right; there has been a number of examples where, you know, people have been caught spying, and the\nuniversities have not really punished them. For example, the case\na few years ago of the Russian illegals in the United States, the\n10 Russian illegals——\nMr. MARSHALL. Right.\nMr. GOLDEN. —the case that gave rise to the show The Americans, seven or eight of them had been in U.S. universities and one\nof them had gone to Columbia Business School, and evidence came\nout that her role there had been to recruit classmates and professors, and yet Columbia didn’t revoke her degree when it came out\nthat she wasn’t Cynthia Murphy, she was Lydia Guryeva and she\nwas working for Russia.\nMr. MARSHALL. We’re over my time. I’m sorry. I yield back the\nrest of my time. Thank you.\nMs. VAN CLEAVE. Mr. Chair, if I might interject, I need to correct\nthe record of an answer I just gave a moment ago. The $510 billion\nfigure which I cited in fact is the amount that we annually invest\nin R&D, but consulting my notes of the Huntsman-Blair Commission report, they had this to say last year: ‘‘We estimate that at the\nlow end the annual cost to the U.S. economy of several categories\nof IP theft exceeds $225 billion with the unknown cost of other\ntypes of IP theft almost certainly exceeding that amount and possibly as high as $600 billion annually.’’\nMr. MARSHALL. Six hundred billion?\nMs. VAN CLEAVE. Yes.\nMr. MARSHALL. Yes, thank you.\nMr. HIGGINS. I thank my colleagues, and if our panelists will accommodate us, we’ll have a second round of questioning if you can\nall stay. Thank you. I recognize myself for five minutes for questioning.\nMr. Wessel and Ms. Van Cleave, the China-United States Exchange Foundation, a China-based and government-connected foundation, is registered as a foreign agent representing China. Do you\nfind it concerning that some universities in the United States have\naccepted funding from this foreign agent, and how should universities handle outside organizations like this when it comes to potential funding? Mr. Wessel?\nMr. WESSEL. I find it very troubling and talk about that briefly\nin my testimony. It’s a function of a number of things, including\nthe funding problems I think was referred to earlier that we face\nwith higher education. They are seeking these funds. They are\n\n\n-----\n\n122\n\nseeking foreign students who often pay the full boat when they’re\napplying.\nI think, number one, we should be monitoring their activities.\nNumber two, we should be requiring that students who attend\nthose programs be informed of the nature of the sponsorship. The\ncurriculum, the personnel are chosen by the Chinese Government\nor those working for the Chinese Government, and their materials\nshould have a disclaimer on it so people understand that this is an\nattempt to influence and it’s essentially propaganda.\nMr. HIGGINS. Ms. Van Cleave?\nMs. VAN CLEAVE. It’s hard to add to that statement. I fully endorse what Michael said. This is a serious concern. Of course, it is\nalso an opportunity when we know that there’s a specific foreign\ninterest in a particular university. From a counterintelligence perspective, it shines a light that that nation-state has a particular interest here and is willing to invest money in it, but it’s small compensation for the risk presented.\nMr. HIGGINS. Is there enhanced vetting at the federal level for\na foreign exchange student out of a potential threat nation-state\nlike China where there’s examples of intellectual property theft? Is\nthere enhanced vetting at the federal level right now prior to the\nuniversity level?\nMs. VAN CLEAVE. Not that I am aware of. Others on the panel\nmay have a different insight on that——\nMr. HIGGINS. I think they should be.\nMs. VAN CLEAVE. —but as long as they’re meeting the requirement for the visa to be issued and they have the support of the university, we are a very open and welcoming country.\nMr. HIGGINS. Let me ask you each this question. How can the\nUnited States universities vet or conduct due diligence on potential\nChinese or other foreign partners that may have access to our laboratories and in our universities?\nMr. WESSEL. My view of that is that’s primarily a governmental\nrole and not the universities’ but that—where there are—again research that’s going on either with cleared defense contractors with\ngovernmental agencies where there’s federal money, there should\nbe a certain level of scrutiny.\nAnd to your earlier question, one of the problems we found at the\nChina Commission was that foreign students were coming in under\nvisas, for example, to study liberal arts, and once—and they would\nchange a semester later to physics, to computer sciences, et cetera,\nwhere there may be threats that we want to look at. Universities\nshould be responsible when the terms of a student’s participation\nat the university has changed, to talk to the authorities, inform\nthem, and then leave it to the authorities as to whether there\nshould be follow-up.\nMr. HIGGINS. Do you believe vetting at the federal level should\nbe tied to the intended course of study for foreign exchange students?\nMr. WESSEL. I believe the—for the target of the research—and\nso I’m focused more on the laboratory work that’s done rather than\njust the general teaching at a university, so a computer science\ncourse is one thing, but if that person goes into computer science\n\n\n-----\n\n123\n\nlab where there may be work on encryption, for example, that\nshould have higher scrutiny.\nMr. HIGGINS. And for federally funded university laboratories,\nshould there not be a responsibility to report that adjustment of\nthat student’s intended course of study?\nMr. WESSEL. Yes. As I said earlier, if they change the terms of\ntheir visas when they came here and what the situation they were\nsupposed to enter, if that changes, there should be information to\nthe Federal Government.\nMr. HIGGINS. Thank you for your answers.\nI recognize my colleague, Mr. Beyer, for five minutes for questions.\nMr. BEYER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, very much.\nYou know, the National Science Board recently released its biennial Science and Engineering Indicators report, and the basics is\nthat federal investment in basic research and development vis-a-vis\nthe United States, the Chinese are rapidly gaining ground on us.\nI talked to many of my friends in the medical field, and they just\ntalk about how much more they’re investing than we are. And of\ncourse this is unacceptable if we want to maintain our leadership\nin science and engineering.\nBut to the point of this commission, what role does persistent flat\nfunding of U.S. science research have on our reliance on cost-sharing with international partners or give us additional vulnerabilities\nin terms of espionage? Anyone want to grapple with that question?\nMr. WESSEL. I think it makes us vulnerable. There have been instances in the past, again, from the China perspective where there\nhave been investments by or attempted investments by Chinese entities, government-affiliated in our universities and those that\nhave, you know, stable funding in States where they’re a public\nuniversity where there have been budget cuts for any of a number\nof reasons, and there has been greater receptivity to those investments. That of course then opens up the underlying research to advantage other players. That has a serious cost to it.\nMr. BEYER. Great. Mr. Golden, some half-hour ago you wanted\nto jump in on the Goethe-Institut vis-a-vis—well, the Confucius Institute vis-&-vis Goethe, et cetera.\nMr. GOLDEN. Yes, thank you, Congressman, for giving me that\nopportunity. Well, one difference between the Confucius Institutes\nand these arms of other nations is that they tend to be on campus,\nwhereas the institutes of the French, German, British Governments tend to be off-campus. And, you know, the Confucius Institute courses at many universities they are not for academic credit\nbut at some universities they are, so they’re more, you know, integrated for whatever reason kind of into the academic environment\nand thus, you know, might be potentially more influential. And of\ncourse they’re also accompanied in some cases by quite a bit of\nmoney to the university.\nI was also going to say about them, you know, there was mentions of the foundation that is part of the Chinese Government. The\nConfucius Institute for all intents and purposes are an arm of the\nChinese Government. They’re from an affiliate of the Education\nMinistry. And the research for my book indicated that they’re not\nintended as an arm of espionage because it’s the Education Min\n\n-----\n\n124\n\nistry, but at times, the—China’s Intelligence Ministry does approach Directors and staff of Confucius Institute and ask them to\ngather information. And the FBI does as well. Both China and the\nUnited States are interested in using Confucius Institute personnel\nas intelligence assets because they’re so well-positioned.\nMr. BEYER. Okay. Thank you very much. You know, the National\nScience Foundation has had a long-standing policy of rarely doing\ndirect support for foreign organizations and that when they did, it\nwould have to be allocated only to the U.S. portion of a project. But\nin January this year, they revised its quote/unquote ‘‘proposal and\naward policies and procedures guide’’ to address all the international branches of American universities which are springing up\naround the world. And another revision calls for funding for a collaborative project involving foreign organizations, and they both\nnow require the proposal requesting funds for an international\nbranch or for a foreign organization to justify why the research activities cannot be performed on a U.S. campus or by a U.S. organization.\nDo you have any thoughts on National Science Foundation’s policy change from rarely doing it out of the United States to just now\nallowing it for foreign organizations and for—or for, say, the\nGeorge Mason campus in Qatar? Any thoughts?\nMr. WESSEL. My thought is I’d prefer—vastly prefer that it be occurring on U.S. university campuses, and if there’s a gap here that\nour government, NSF, and others work to fill that gap here rather\nthan through a foreign university collaboration.\nMr. BEYER. Yes. Well, thank you. You know, that’s sort of the\nhalf-point I wanted to make. On the one hand, the previous question, we want a—we keep hearing again and again that the National Science Foundation is able to award an ever-smaller percentage of its excellent proposals with money because there’s just not\nenough research money with this interesting change in policy, suggesting that they’re going to invest overseas rather than here. So—\nanyway, thank you very much.\nMr. Chair, I yield back.\nMr. HIGGINS. I thank my colleague and recognize Mr.\nLoudermilk for five minutes for questions.\nMr. LOUDERMILK. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate the additional time.\nMr. Hassold, I kind of want to circle back to where we left off\nin the previous questioning regarding the Iranian attacks on our\nuniversities. We were discussing whether or not they were softer\ntargets, and you explained that there’s more transition within the\nuniversities and a lot of corporate businesses. A follow-up on that\nis did these Iranian actors have the same success rate with nonacademic organizations, institutions as they did the academic?\nMr. HASSOLD. The outcomes of the attacks is something I do not\nhave insight into, as well as I believe the private organizations that\nwere targeted is something that’s only—that I only know of\nthrough the FBI—or the DOJ indictment.\nMr. LOUDERMILK. Okay. I appreciate that. Of the 31 terabytes\nthat’s been reported that was stolen, what type of data was contained in that?\n\n\n-----\n\n125\n\nMr. HASSOLD. That’s also something that’s—that I don’t have\nspecific knowledge into. I just know that they—that the targeting\nthat I observed was the academic research databases. I’m assuming\nthat much of that 31 terabytes came from that exfiltration data.\nMr. LOUDERMILK. Okay. And from what I’ve read, a lot of it is\nmedical research and R&D-type information. How do these universities respond? When you notify them or when they realize that\nthey’ve been a target of a phishing attack or an outside breach into\ntheir systems, how have they responded to these, specifically, the\nIranian attack?\nMr. HASSOLD. So since I’ve started researching the group and\ntheir attacks, every time I’ve identified a new American university\nthat’s been targeted, I have both contacted REN–ISAC to let them\nfilter the information through their specific context for universities,\nas well as when I’ve been able to identify a specific point of contact\nat a university, I directly informed them of potential phishing attack. REN–ISAC has been fantastic. They have—we’ve been in\ncommunication a significant amount, and they have confirmed that\nnotifications have gone out.\nI haven’t gotten response back from universities based on my\ncommunications. However, I wouldn’t really expect that. I would\nreally more expect them to take the information and try to mitigate\non their side. From what I understand with most phishing attacks,\nthe way a lot of universities deal with them is that they block the\nmalicious sites and most infrastructure on their internal networks,\nwhich is a quick way to deal with them. However, one of the issues\nwith that is if there is a user that is not network that tries to access the malicious sites, that same protection is not afforded to\nthem. So things like actually trying to mitigate the actual sites and\nshutting those sites down is an additional step that could be done\nto help prevent the damage caused by these types of attacks.\nMr. LOUDERMILK. Well, have you seen, are they reporting these\nIP addresses to have them blacklisted or do they communicate with\nother universities? I mean, the strength of these research universities is the collaboration on their research and development. Are\nthey collaborating with one another to highlight that, you know,\nwe’ve been subjected to a phishing attack, we’ve been—data has\nbeen breached? Are they going outside of their own infrastructure?\nI mean, I commend them. You know, you go into your gateway,\nyour firewall, you block that IP address, but from an IT perspective, there seems to be so many more things that could be done,\nhiding your page such as this so it’s not available to the public to\nreplicate that, that you have to be interior to the network to actually get to that page, reporting to your internet provider to have\nthe IP blacklisted, I mean, that’s one step that—of course, they can\nchange their IP addresses, but also education and collaborating\nwith other universities. I mean, do you see that they’re doing this\nand what other steps could they or should they be taking?\nMr. HASSOLD. I’m sure every university is different specifically\nhow they deal with these types of attacks. There are resources like\nREN–ISAC, which I’ve mentioned multiple times, that sort of is\nthat central place for intelligence and information-sharing that\nthey can use. I don’t know how much universities directly interact\n\n\n-----\n\n126\n\nwith one another, especially—I would assume that there would be\nsome sort of interaction.\nThere are some other defensive tactics that would probably stem\nthe effectiveness of these types of attacks like multifactor authentication that a lot of schools don’t utilize. And from what I’ve\nlearned with my discussions with university partners, as well as\nsome of the folks at REN–ISAC, the cost associated with implementing multifactor authentication is pretty significant, and a lot\nof universities don’t have the sources of funding to be able to pay\nfor things like that. But something like multifactor authentication\nwould be able to prevent some of these types of attacks after the\nfact by not allowing foreign actors to be able to login to the actual\nlegitimate pages.\nMr. LOUDERMILK. I appreciate that. And so as with any attack,\nit appears this could have been prevented by, you know—and hindsight is 20/20, but it could have been prevented.\nLast question. Are the universities taking this serious enough to\nprevent it from happening in the future? And I’ll open that up to\nanybody on the panel.\nMr. HASSOLD. That’s a good question. That would be a question\nI think would be better suited to be answered by the actual universities. I think they would probably have better insight into it. But\nI think this—these—this type of threat is so sophisticated that\ndealing with it would take significant resources to do and a significant planning and collaboration amongst the entire academic institution.\nMr. LOUDERMILK. Thank you. Anyone else care to—all right.\nWell, Mr. Chairman, thank you. I yield back.\nMr. HIGGINS. I thank my colleague.\nThis has certainly been an enlightening conversation we’ve engaged in today. I thank the witnesses for their valuable testimony\nand the Members for their questions.

From my experience and understanding,\nmembers of Federal Advisory Committees (other than designated\nrepresentatives of non-governmental organizations) serve as Special\nGovernment Employees. As such, they are subject to the Ethics in\nGovernment laws, including the laws governing conflicts of interest. My\nreading of those laws would suggest that working for a foreign entity with\ninterests contrary to those of the United States would be disqualifying. I am\nnot familiar with the case that you site, but on its face I find it a cause for\nconcern. At a minimum, the Committee may want to review the ethics laws\nto ensure that the prospect of foreign influence over federal advisory\ncommittee members is explicitly called out as a conflict of interest, and\nrigorously enforced.\n\n\n-----\n\n131\n\n_Responses by Mr. Daniel Golden_\n\n**HOUSE COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE, SPACE, AND TECHNOLOGY**\n\n\"Scholars or Spies: Foreign Plots Targeting America's Research and\n\nDevelopment\"\n\nMr. Daniel Golden, Author, Spy Schools\n\nQuestions Submitted by Ranking Member Daniel Lipinski,\nSubcommittee on Research & Technology.\nHouse Committee on Science.

These\noperations are a more indirect method of obtaining a desired objective that take\nconsiderably more time than a direct cyber attack to steal research material from\nour public institutions and private companies. We should always be identifying\nany way our adversaries could exploit our resources; however, in the future, the\nbiggest threats will likely come from the cyber attack surface.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Appendix II\n\nADDITIONAL MATERIAL FOR THE RECORD\n\n(133)\n\n\n-----\n\n134\n\nDOCUMENTS SUBMITTED BY REPRESENTATIVE DONALD S.

As part of the government-university partnership, U.S.\nuniversities share a responsibility with the federal government to ensure that research conducted\nunder their auspices contributes to our national defense and homeland security. Each must work to\nensure that the fruits of this research are appropriately secured and protected fi·om outside intrusion\nor theft by foreign actors and/or governments.\n\nTogether, our four associations represent all major U.S. research universities and higher\neducation institutions. Our member research universities share a vested interest with the\ngovernment in ensuring that intellectual property, proprietary information, trade secrets, sensitive\ndata, and other classified and/or otherwise controlled government information developed or\nhoused at our institutions is not susceptible to academic exfiltration, espionage, or exploitation.\nAccordingly, we welcome the oppottunity to continue to work constmctively and cooperatively\nwith Congress and the major national security agencies, including the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation (FBI), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the National Security Agency\n(NSA), and the Departments of Justice, Homeland Security, State, Defense, Commerce and\n**govetnment research agencies to protect legitimate national security interests associated with**\n**scientific research conducted at** **universities.**\n\nWe greatly appreciate past efforts by the federal government, such as programs launched by the\nU.S. Departments of Commerce and State, the FBI, and other security agencies, to engage with\nthe higher education community and to forge closer relationships between the academic and\nsecurity communities both at the local and national levels. The higher education community\nvalues the increased training and outreach efforts undertaken by the Commerce Departmenf s\nBureau of lnclustrv and Sccuritv ( BlS) to help ensure understanding of and compliance with\nexport control laws.
