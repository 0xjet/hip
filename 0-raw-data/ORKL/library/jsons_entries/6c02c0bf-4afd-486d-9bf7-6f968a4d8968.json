    "plain_text": "# France Ties Russia's Sandworm to a Multiyear Hacking Spree\n\n**wired.com/story/sandworm-centreon-russia-hack/**\n\nAndy Greenberg February 15, 2021\n\nThe Russian military [hackers known as Sandworm, responsible for everything from](https://www.wired.com/story/sandworm-kremlin-most-dangerous-hackers/)\n[blackouts in Ukraine to](https://www.wired.com/story/russian-hackers-attack-ukraine/) [NotPetya, the most destructive malware in history, don't have a](https://www.wired.com/story/notpetya-cyberattack-ukraine-russia-code-crashed-the-world/)\nreputation for discretion. But a French security agency now warns that hackers with tools and\ntechniques it links to Sandworm have stealthily hacked targets in that country by exploiting\nan IT monitoring tool called Centreon—and appear to have gotten away with it undetected\nfor as long as three years.\n\nOn Monday, the French information security agency ANSSI published an advisory warning\nthat hackers with links to Sandworm, a group within Russia's GRU military intelligence\nagency, had breached several French organizations. The agency describes those victims as\n\"mostly\" IT firms and particularly web hosting companies. Remarkably, ANSSI says the\nintrusion campaign dates back to late 2017 and continued until 2020. In those breaches, the\nhackers appear to have compromised servers running Centreon, sold by the firm of the same\nname based in Paris.\n\n\n-----\n\nThough ANSSI says it hasn t been able to identify how those servers were hacked, it found\non them two different pieces of malware: one publicly available backdoor called PAS, and\nanother known as Exaramel, which Slovakian cybersecurity firm ESET has spotted\nSandworm using in previous intrusions. While hacking groups do reuse each other's malware\n—sometimes intentionally to mislead investigators—the French agency also says it's seen\noverlap in command and control servers used in the Centreon hacking campaign and\nprevious Sandworm hacking incidents.\n\nThough it's far from clear what Sandworm's hackers might have intended in the years-long\nFrench hacking campaign, any Sandworm intrusion raises alarms among those who have\nseen the results of the group's past work. \"Sandworm is linked with destructive ops,\" says\nJoe Slowik, a researcher for security firm DomainTools who has tracked Sandworm's\nactivities for years, including an attack on the Ukrainian power grid where an early variant of\nSandworm's Exaramel backdoor appeared. \"Even though there's no known endgame linked\nto this campaign documented by the French authorities, the fact that it's taking place is\nconcerning, because the end goal of most Sandworm operations is to cause some\nnoticeable disruptive effect. We should be paying attention.\"\n\nANSSI didn't identify the victims of the hacking campaign. But a page of Centreon's website\n[lists customers including telecom providers Orange and OptiComm, IT consulting firm CGI,](https://www.centreon.com/en/company/resources/feedback-from-customers/)\ndefense and aerospace firm Thales, steel and mining firm ArcelorMittal, Airbus, Air France\nKLM, logistics firm Kuehne + Nagel, nuclear power firm EDF, and the French Department of\nJustice.\n\nIn an emailed statement Tuesday, however, a Centreon spokesperson wrote that no actual\nCentreon customers were affected in the hacking campaign. Instead, the company says that\nvictims were using an open-source version of Centreon's software that the company hasn't\nsupported for more than five years, and argues that they were deployed insecurely, including\nallowing connections from outside the organization's network. The statement also notes that\nANSSI has counted \"only about 15\" targets of the intrusions. \"Centreon is currently\ncontacting all of its customers and partners to assist them in verifying their installations are\ncurrent and complying with ANSSI’s guidelines for a Healthy Information System,\" the\nstatement adds. \"Centreon recommends that all users who still have an obsolete version of\nits open source software in production update it to the latest version or contact Centreon and\nits network of certified partners.\"\n\nSome in the cybersecurity industry immediately interpreted the ANSSI report to suggest\nanother [software supply chain attack of the kind](https://www.wired.com/story/russia-hack-supply-chain-reckoning/) [carried out against SolarWinds. In a vast](https://www.wired.com/story/russia-solarwinds-supply-chain-hack-commerce-treasury/)\nhacking campaign revealed late last year, Russian hackers altered that firm's IT monitoring\napplication and it used to penetrate a still-unknown number of networks that includes at least\nhalf a dozen US federal agencies.\n\n\n-----\n\nBut ANSSI s report doesn t mention a supply chain compromise, and Centreon writes in its\nstatement that \"this is not a supply chain type attack and no parallel with other attacks of this\ntype can be made in this case.\" In fact, DomainTools' Slowik says the intrusions instead\nappear to have been carried out simply by exploiting internet-facing servers running\nCentreon's software inside the victims' networks. He points out that this would align with\nanother warning about Sandworm that the NSA published in May of last year: The\nintelligence agency warned Sandworm was hacking internet-facing machines running the\nExim email client, which runs on Linux servers. Given that Centreon's software runs on\nCentOS, which is also Linux-based, the two advisories point to similar behavior during the\nsame timeframe. \"Both of these campaigns in parallel, during some of the same period of\ntime, were being used to identify externally facing, vulnerable servers that happened to be\nrunning Linux for initial access or movement within victim networks,\" Slowik says. (In contrast\nwith Sandworm, which has been widely identified as part of the GRU, the SolarWinds attacks\nhave also yet to be definitively linked to any specific intelligence agency, though security\nfirms and the US intelligence community have attributed the hacking campaign to the\nRussian government.)\n\nAlthough Sandworm has focused many of its most notorious cyberattacks on Ukraine—\nincluding the NotPetya worm that spread from Ukraine to cause $10 billion in damage\nglobally—the GRU hasn't shied away from aggressively hacking French targets in the past.\nIn 2016, GRU hackers posing as Islamic extremists destroyed the network of France's TV5\ntelevision network, taking its 12 channels off the air. The next year, GRU hackers including\n[Sandworm carried out an email hack-and-leak operation intended to sabotage the](https://www.wired.com/story/sandworm-russia-cyberattack-links/)\npresidential campaign of French presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron.\n\nWhile no such disruptive effects appear to have resulted from the hacking campaign\ndescribed in ANSSI's report, the Centreon intrusions should serve as a warning, says John\nHultquist, the vice president of intelligence at security firm FireEye, whose team of\nresearchers first named Sandworm in 2014. He notes that FireEye has yet to attribute the\nintrusions to Sandworm independently of ANSSI—but also cautions that it's too early to say\nthat the campaign is over. \"This could be intelligence collection, but Sandworm has a long\nhistory of activity we have to consider,\" says Hultquist. \"Any time we find Sandworm with\nclear access over a long period of time, we need to brace for impact.\"\n\n**_Update 2/16/21 1:20PM ET: This story has been updated with additional comment from_**\n_Centreon._\n\nMore Great WIRED Stories\n\n📩 The latest on tech, science, and more: [Get our newsletters!](https://www.wired.com/newsletter?sourceCode=BottomStories)\n[Premature babies and the lonely terror of a pandemic NICU](https://www.wired.com/story/preterm-babies-lonely-terror-of-a-pandemic-nicu/?itm_campaign=BottomRelatedStories_Sections_1&itm_content=footer-recirc)\n[The recession exposes the US’ failures on worker retraining](https://www.wired.com/story/recession-exposes-us-failures-worker-retraining/?itm_campaign=BottomRelatedStories_Sections_1&itm_content=footer-recirc)\n[Forget blood—your skin might know if you’re sick](https://www.wired.com/story/forget-blood-your-skin-might-know-if-youre-sick/?itm_campaign=BottomRelatedStories_Sections_1&itm_content=footer-recirc)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Why insider Zoom bombs are so hard to stop](https://www.wired.com/story/zoombomb-inside-jobs/?itm_campaign=BottomRelatedStories_Sections_1&itm_content=footer-recirc)\nHow to [free up space on your laptop](https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-free-space-on-your-laptop/?itm_campaign=BottomRelatedStories_Sections_1&itm_content=footer-recirc)\n🎮 WIRED Games: Get the latest [tips, reviews, and more](https://www.wired.com/tag/video-games/?itm_campaign=BottomRelatedStories_Sections_1&itm_content=footer-recirc)\nJ Want the best tools to get healthy?
