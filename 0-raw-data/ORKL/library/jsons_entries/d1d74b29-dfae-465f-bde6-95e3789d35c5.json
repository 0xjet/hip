Approximately two years ago, countless system administrators\nand IT teams were forced to work around the clock to address Nobelium’s attack on\nSolarWinds. And last year, they similarly targeted numerous IT supply chains in the hopes of\nbeing able to embed themselves once again deep inside IT networks. But fast forward to\ntoday, and the Nobelium group seems to have shifted their focus. This time, rather than\ntargeting software solutions, they have begun targeting embassies. While these attacks may\nnot impact the average Windows computer user, they do have potentially larger political\nramifications.\n\nFortiGuard Labs has uncovered evidence that the Nobelium group is impersonating someone\nassociated with the Turkish embassy in targeted email-based attacks. We will be analyzing\none such attack that uses Omicron/Covid-19 as a lure. Those working in or around embassies\nare urged to be extra diligent when opening emails.\n\nIn this blog, we will highlight techniques and code reuse by Nobelium. We will also highlight\nthe usage of JARM, which is a widely used technology created by Salesforce to fingerprint\nand track malicious servers.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1: Embassy email\nThe source email address seems to be a legitimate, albeit compromised email account of a\ngovernment department focused on social affairs. In tracing this, however, this email comes\nfrom a French-speaking country in Africa. It is disguised as coming from a Turkish embassy\nand sent to a Portuguese-speaking nation, although it is written in English.\n\nThe email itself comes with a .HTML file attachment. This file contains malicious JavaScript\ndesigned to create an .ISO file on the user’s computer. Figure 2 shows some similarities\nbetween a previous Nobelium attack and this current version.\n\nFigure 2: Malicious Javascript\nThe original [HTML Smuggling attack conducted by Nobelium used EnvyScout to convert a](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/006/)\ntext blob into an .ISO file. EnvyScout is one of the toolsets used as a dropper in spearphishing\nattacks by this APT group. As seen in Figure 2, both samples used an application type of “xcd-image.” This part of the attack has changed very little. However, Figure 3 below shows the\nfunction used to create the .ISO file has been streamlined from previous iterations.\n\nFigure 3: ISO creation\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce the .ISO file has been created on the user s machine, the attack requires a user to open\nthe file. By default, opening an .ISO file on modern versions of Windows causes it to mount\nthe file on the next available drive letter. Once mounted, the files can be seen. Figure 4 below\nshows this part of the attack chain.\n\nFigure 4: Mounted ISO files\nOne of the previous variants of the Nobelium attack was dated almost exactly one year prior\nto the current attack. Both versions contain malicious shortcuts that point to a DLL file. In\nthe current version, the DLL file inside the bin folder is named\n“DeleteDateConnectionPosition.dll.”\n\nIn the past, one of the payloads used was a Cobalt Strike beacon, and this is the case in this\ncurrent version. Given the current political situation, it is clearly in Russia’s best interest to\nknow what other governments are thinking, planning, and doing, and successful installation\nof a Cobalt Strike beacon provides a foothold into the embassies they are interested in\nmonitoring. To achieve this objective, the shortcut launches the DLL using an export named\n“DeleteDateConnectionPosition.”\n\nFigure 5: DLL Exports\nMany of the exports inside the DLL contain junk code. As such, debugging the malware is\nfaster than statically analyzing it. Once completed we discovered a C2 server, as shown\nbelow.\n\nFigure 6: Debugging the malicious DLL\nAccording to our sources, this server is not a shared server and the IP address only contains\nthe sinitude[.]com domain.\n\n## JARM Fingerprinting\n\n[For those unfamiliar with JARM, it is a technology developed by Salesforce to fingerprint](https://engineering.salesforce.com/easily-identify-malicious-servers-on-the-internet-with-jarm-e095edac525a)\nservers for the purposes of clustering. Specifically, JARM revolves around a server’s TLS\nimplementation. As further explained by Salesforce, it is not a secure crypto function, and as\na result, it may produce false positives. Nevertheless, it has been a fairly accurate way to\ngroup malicious servers into relevant clusters.\n\nThe JARM signature for sinitude[.]com has been found on numerous servers. Many of these\n[servers have also acted as Cobalt Strike beacon C2 servers. During the course of our](https://github.com/carbonblack/active_c2_ioc_public/blob/main/cobaltstrike/JARM/jarm_cs_202107_uniq_sorted.txt)\n[investigation, we found that this JARM signature was also found on C2 servers associated](https://80vul.medium.com/one-zoomeye-query-cleans-bazarloader-c2s-4b49a71ec10d)\nwith the malware family BazarLoader. BazarLoader, among other things, contains code and\napplication guardrails that makes sure it is not running on a Russian computer.\n\n\n-----\n\nBy looking at network traffic since the beginning of this year, we found that several IP\naddresses are connected to sinitude[.]com. However, our data indicates that only one IP\naddress (back in January) actually created a full connection to communicate with the C2.\nThis IP address is located in Kharkiv, the second largest city in Ukraine. This Kharkiv IP\naddress itself has communicated with unique malware families and is part of the TOR\nnetwork.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this latest attack, Nobelium has used techniques similar to those they have used in the\npast. Malicious emails remain the predominant way to infiltrate organizations, and Nobelium\ntakes advantage of that attack vector. The biggest difference now is the political landscape.\nWhile previous attacks carried out by Nobelium may have been more technical in nature, this\nlatest round has far more consequences on the political world stage.\n\n## Fortinet Protections\n\nThe FortiGuard Antivirus Service detects and blocks both the .ISO and DLL files as\nW64/CobaltStrike_Beacon.A!tr.\n\nThe FortiGuard Antivirus Service detects and blocks the malicious html email attachment as\nJS/Agent.ONO!tr.\n\nAll relevant network IOCs are blocked by the WebFiltering client.\n\n## MITRE TTPs\n\n**Initial Access**\n\nPhishing: Spearphishing Attachment T1566.001\n\n**Execution**\n\nCommand and Scripting Interpreter: JavaScript T1059.007\n\nUser Execution: Malicious File T1204.002\n\n**Defense Evasion**\n\nBuild Image on Host T1612\n\n\n-----\n\nDeobfuscate/Decode Files or Information T1140\n\nObfuscated Files or Information: HTML Smuggling T1027.006\n\n**Command and Control**\n\nApplication Layer Protocol: Web Protocols T1071.001\n\n**Impact**\n\nResource Hijacking T1496\n\n## IOCs\n\n**File IOCs**\n\nCovid.html (SHA2:\nA896C2D16CADCDEDD10390C3AF3399361914DB57BDE1673E46180244E806A1D0)\n\nCovid.iso (SHA2:\n3CB0D2CFF9DB85C8E816515DDC380EA73850846317B0BB73EA6145C026276948)\n\nDeleteDateConnectionPosition.dll (SHA2:\n6EE1E629494D7B5138386D98BD718B010EE774FE4A4C9D0E069525408BB7B1F7)\n\n**Network IOCs**\n\nSinitude[.]com\n\nJARM Signature:\n2ad2ad0002ad2ad0002ad2ad2ad2ade1a3c0d7ca6ad8388057924be83dfc6a\n\n_[Learn more about FortiGuard Labs global threat intelligence and research and the](https://www.fortinet.com/fortiguard/labs?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=FortiGuardLabs)_\n_[FortiGuard Security Subscriptions and Services portfolio.](https://www.fortinet.com/support/support-services/fortiguard-security-subscriptions/fortiguard-services-bundles.html?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=fortiguard-service-bundles)_\n\n\n-----",
