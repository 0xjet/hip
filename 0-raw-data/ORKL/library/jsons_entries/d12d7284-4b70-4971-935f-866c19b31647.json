The attacks targeted government and financial organizations in Australia,\nRussia, Belgium, Malaysia, Vietnam, and the Philippines.\n\n[Unit 42 continued to monitor these espionage campaigns and today reports that the Chinese](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/alloy-taurus)\nthreat actor uses new malware variants against targets in South Africa and Nepal.\n\n## PingPull on Linux\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Linux variant of PingPull is an ELF file that only 3 out of 62 anti-virus vendors currently\nflag as malicious.\n\nUnit 42 was able to determine it's a port of the known Windows malware by noticing\nsimilarities in the HTTP communication structure, POST parameters, AES key, and the\ncommands it receives from the threat actor's C2 server.\n\nThe commands the C2 sends to the malware are indicated by a single uppercase character\nin the HTTP parameter, and the payload returns the results to the server via a base64encoded request.\n\nThe parameters and corresponding commands are:\n\nA – Get the current directory\nB – List folder\nC – Read text file\nD – Write a text file\nE – Delete file or folder\nF – Read binary file, convert to hex\nG – Write binary file, convert to hex\nH – Copy file or folder\nI – Rename a file\nJ – Create a Directory\nK – Timestamp file with a specified timestamp in \"%04d-%d-%d %d:%d:%d\" format\nM – Run command\n\nUnit 42 comments that the command handlers used in PingPull match those observed in\n[another malware named 'China Chopper,' a web shell seen heavily used in attacks against](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-govt-china-sponsored-hackers-targeting-exchange-citrix-f5-flaws/)\nMicrosoft Exchange servers.\n\n## Sword2023 details\n\nUnit 42 also found a new ELF backdoor that communicated with the same command and\ncontrol server (C2) as PingPull.\n\nThis is a simpler tool with more basic functions like uploading files on the breached system,\nexfiltrating files, and executing a command with \"; echo <random number>\\n\" appended to it.\n\nThe echo command adds random data on the execution log, possibly to make analysis more\nchallenging or obfuscate its activity.\n\nUnit 42 discovered a second Sword2023 sample associated with a different C2 address\nimpersonating the South African military.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe same sample was linked to a Soft Ether VPN address, a product that Gallium is known\nto use in its operations.\n\n**Gallium's C2 map based on malware communication** _(Unit 42)_\nThe cybersecurity firm comments that this isn't a random choice, as in February 2023, South\nAfrica took part in joint military exercises with Russia and China.\n\nIn conclusion, Gallium continues to refine its arsenal and broadens its target range using the\nnew Linux variants of PingPull and the newly discovered Sword2023 backdoor.\n\nOrganizations must adopt a comprehensive security strategy to effectively counter this\nsophisticated threat rather than relying solely on static detection methods.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n['Bitter' espionage hackers target Chinese nuclear energy orgs](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/bitter-espionage-hackers-target-chinese-nuclear-energy-orgs/)\n\n[Winter Vivern APT hackers use fake antivirus scans to install malware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/winter-vivern-apt-hackers-use-fake-antivirus-scans-to-install-malware/)\n\n[YoroTrooper cyberspies target CIS energy orgs, EU embassies](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/yorotrooper-cyberspies-target-cis-energy-orgs-eu-embassies/)\n\n[SonicWall devices infected by malware that survives firmware upgrades](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/sonicwall-devices-infected-by-malware-that-survives-firmware-upgrades/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Newly exposed APT43 hacking group targeting US orgs since 2018](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/newly-exposed-apt43-hacking-group-targeting-us-orgs-since-2018/)\n\n[Bill Toulas](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/bill-toulas/)\n\nBill Toulas is a technology writer and infosec news reporter with over a decade of experience\nworking on various online publications.
