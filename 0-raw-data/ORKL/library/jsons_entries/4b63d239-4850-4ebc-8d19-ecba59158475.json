However, if you save the file on\nthe computer, it looks like a PDF document because the executable file has the PDF icon in the resource.\n\nOnce the malicious executable attachment is opened, the main payload is dropped in the victim machine and displays a\ndecoy file to the victim. Figure 2 shows the contents of the decoy file which is a PDF whose contents are an exact match\n[to an article published on Rostec’s website on January 30, 2018th](http://rostec.ru/news/rostekh-initsiiroval-pilotnyy-proekt-po-sozdaniyu-zhilishchno-stroitelnykh-kooperativov-dlya-rabotni/) . The article discusses new housing project plans by\nRostec and other state departments, and the benefits to the defence industry workers who are eligible for free housing\nunder the project.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nthe malware family have already been published, we will discuss some of the unique indicators and techniques the threat\nactor behind Bisonal employed in this campaign.\n\n## Malware Analysis\n\n**Malware Dropper**\n\nThe dropper executable file in the Russian attack hides the encrypted Bisonal DLL file and non-malicious decoy file at the\nend of its body. Once executed, the dropper decrypts the data blob using the RC4 cipher with the key, “34123412”, saves\nthem in the path shown below and executes them.\n\n**Type** **PATH** **SHA256**\n\nDropper N/A b1da7e1963dc09c325ba3ea2442a54afea02929ec26477a1b120ae44368082f8\nEXE\n\nBisonal C:\\Windows\\Temp\\pvcu.dll 1128D10347DD602ECD3228FAA389ADD11415BF6936E2328101311264547AFA75\nDLL\n\nRussian C:\\Windows\\Temp\\Комплексный F431E0BED6B4B7FFEF5E40B1B4B7078F2538F2B2DB2869D831DE5D7DF26EE6CD\nDecoy проект по созданию жилищноPDF строительных кооперативов для\n\nработников оборонки.pdf\n\n_Table 1. File hashes and paths targeting Russia_\n\nThe dropper then creates following registry entry to execute the Bisonal sample when the computer reboots:\n\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER \\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\”vert” = “rundll32.exe\nc:\\windows\\temp\\pvcu.dll, Qszdez”\n\n## Bisonal main module\n\nThe DLL (pvcu.dll) is Bisonal malware but using a different cipher for C2 communication that other publicly documented\n[samples. Booz Allen Hamilton in 2014 and AhnLab in 2015 reported on Bisonal using a simple XOR cipher to hide the C2](https://boozallenmts.com/resources/news/curious-korlia)\naddress strings in the body. The Bisonal sample we observed in this case employs the RC4 cipher with the key\n“78563412”. To date, all Bisonal samples we have seen using RC4 use this same key. The oldest sample we have dates to\n2014 so this variant has been in the wild for several years\n\n|Type|PATH|SHA256|\n|---|---|---|\n|Dropper EXE|N/A|b1da7e1963dc09c325ba3ea2442a54afea02929ec26477a1b120ae44368082f8|\n|Bisonal DLL|C:\\Windows\\Temp\\pvcu.dll|1128D10347DD602ECD3228FAA389ADD11415BF6936E2328101311264547AFA75|\n|Russian Decoy PDF|C:\\Windows\\Temp\\Комплексный проект по созданию жилищно- строительных кооперативов для работников оборонки.pdf|F431E0BED6B4B7FFEF5E40B1B4B7078F2538F2B2DB2869D831DE5D7DF26EE6CD|\n\n\n-----\n\nAPIs, such as HttpSendRequest() and InternetReadFile().\n\nThis Bisonal variant used in the latest attack communicates with one of the following hard-coded C2 addresses by using\nthe HTTP POST method on TCP port 443.\n\nkted56erhg.dynssl[.]com\neuiro8966.organiccrap[.]com\n\nThese domains are provided by a free DDNS service and both resolve to the same IP address, 116.193.155[.]38.\n\nWhen this Bisonal variant communicates with its C2, the malware sends an HTTP POST request with the static strings\n“ks8d” and “akspbu.txt”, and the IP address of the compromised machine. Figure 3 shows the initial HTTP POST request\nto the C2 server.\n\n\n-----\n\ny g g p g q g\nmalware variant. We have more than 230 samples of Bisonal in total and only 14 samples since 2014 use this incomplete\nUser Agent string. It is unclear whether the author forgot to add closing parenthesis while developing the code, or\nintentionally use this string for validating the connection to the C2 server. Either way, it can be a good Indicator in\nnetwork logs for a possible Bisonal infection.\n\n## C2 Communication\n\nAnother sign of the infection is the data being sent to the C2 server during the initial connection. Every time this variant\nof Bisonal communicates with its C2, it sends a unique id number and backdoor command in the first eight bytes. The\nmalware sends hardcoded DWORD values (0x10000 and 0x3E7) just for the initial connection and receives updated\nvalues from the C2 and uses them for further communication. As described above, all communications between this\nBisonal variant and C2 are encrypted by RC4 cipher with the static key “78563412”. As the result of enciphering static\nvalues, the backdoor always sends identical eight bytes of data (81b2a8977ea31b91) to the C2 first.\n\nSoon after receiving the initial beacon from the victim infected with Bisonal, the C2 replies with a session id number and\nbackdoor command. The session id number is consistent throughout the C2 communication. The malware then processes\nthe given command on the compromised system and sends the result back to C2 with the session id number and the\nbackdoor command number. Then the C2 replies with that same session id number. The backdoor waits five seconds and\nrestarts communication with the C2 with the same session id number.\n\nBelow is an example of the reply to the command, “get system info”. The actual traffic between the C2 and Bisonal\nsample is on the left side, and the decrypted payload is on the right side. The first DWORD (four bytes) is the given\nsession id, 0x00000003, and the next DWORD is a backdoor command, 0x000000C8. At offset 8 of the decrypted\npayload, there is a campaign or target code. In this sample, it is “0425god”.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4 Decrypted payload showing the target/campaign code_\n\nFollowing is the diagram of the session between Bisonal and C2.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5. Bisonal C2 communication flow_\n\nThe following table shows the list of backdoor commands this sample supports.\n\n**Command** **Meaning**\n\n0x000000C8 gets system info\n\n0x000000C9 gets running process list\n\n0x000000CA terminates process\n\n0x000000CB accesses cmd shell\n\n0x000000CD downloads file\n\n0x000000CF executes file\n\n0 000000D1 fil\n\n|Command|Meaning|\n|---|---|\n|0x000000C8|gets system info|\n|0x000000C9|gets running process list|\n|0x000000CA|terminates process|\n|0x000000CB|accesses cmd shell|\n|0x000000CD|downloads file|\n|0x000000CF|executes file|\n\n\n-----\n\n## g y\n\nPrevious reports have discussed Bisonal malware used in attacks against Japan, South Korea and Russia. This particular\nsample we found targeted an organization in Russia and there is a specific system language check for Cyrillic and no\nothers. When the backdoor receives the shell access command, it checks the code page of the compromised system. If\nit’s Cyrillic and the command to the shell is not ‘ipconfig’, the threat converts the command result text encoding from\nCyrillic to UTF-16. For any other code page the malware presumes the resulting text as default Windows ANSI code page\nand also converts it to UTF-16. It is not known why the malware author called out Cyrillic specifically when the malware\nwould convert any text to UTF-16. Windows ANSI code pages supports ASCII characters and non-ASCII values as the\ninternational characters depends on the OS language. UTF-16 can support maximum 1 million characters in Unicode. To\navoid corrupting Cyrillic (and other language) characters in the results, the developer added the code to the malware.\n\n\n-----\n\ny p g g p\n2012. The sample (43459f5117bee7b49f2cee7ce934471e01fb2aa2856f230943460e14e19183a6) contains the marker\nstring “bisonal” which is the origin of the malware name. This is one of the many reasons we strongly believe the latest\nsamples are variants of Bisonal.\n\n_Figure 7. ‘bisonal’ marker string_\n\n## Targeting South Korea\n\nWhile investigating other Bisonal samples we found another dropper submitted to an online malware database on March\n6. The original file name was “2018년 해양경찰청 공무원 (7급 9급) (2018.03.05).pdf.exe”. This translates to “2018 Korean\nCoast Guard Government Employee (Grade 7, Grade 9).pdf.exe” in English. Similar to the Bisonal variant targeting the\nRussian organization, this sample was also disguised as PDF document.\n\n_Figure 8. Malware disguised as PDF_\n\nThe dropper executable installs Bisonal and a decoy file in the paths shown in Table 3, below.\n\n|Type|PATH|SHA256|\n|---|---|---|\n|Dropper EXE|N/A|0641fe04713fbdad272a6f8e9b44631b7554dfd1e1332a8afa767d845a90b3fa|\n\n\nBisonal\nEXE\n\n\n%Temp%\\\n\n[random].tmp\n\n\n359835C4A9DBE2D95E483464659744409E877CB6F5D791DAA33FD601A01376FC\n\n\n-----\n\nPDF .exe].pdf\n\n_Table 3, File hashes and system installation paths targeting South Korea_\n\nThough the functionality of the two dropper samples look very similar, the dropper code of this sample is completely\ndifferent from the Russian targeting sample described above.\n\nThe dropper installs the Bisonal EXE file and decoy PDF file. These files are not encrypted and the offset to the EXE\nand PDF file in the dropper is appended at the end of the dropper file. In the Russian samples, the offset to these\nfiles is hardcoded in the code.\nThe file name of the decoy file is based on the dropper file name. The dropper code creates a PDF at the same\ndirectory, give the same name with itself to the decoy file, removes .exe and adds .pdf in the code. For example, if\nthe file name is ABCDEFG.pdf.exe, the decoy filename would be pdf.pdf.\nThe dropper also creates two VBS scripts in the %Temp% directory with a random 4 digits hexadecimal name. One\nof them opens the decoy PDF file. The other deletes the dropper and the VBS script itself.\n\nThe contents of the decoy PDF is a job descriptions with the South Korean Coast Guard. The original document was a\n[Hangul Word Processor(HWP) file posted on the South Korean Coast Guard website on March 5, 2018. Based on the](http://www.kcg.go.kr/kcg/news/recruit/?boardId=bbs_0000000000000095&mode=view&cntId=53&category=&pageIdx=2&searchCondition=all&searchKeyword=)\nmetadata we found in the PDF, we strongly believe that the attacker converted the HWP to PDF. Figure 8, below, shows\nmetadata added to the decoy file when converting the original file to PDF. The metadata indicates that the file was\ncreated with Adobe Distiller 8.00 (Windows) on March 6 by “조영태” (Cho Young Tae in English).\n\nInterestingly, the same creator name is found in the decoy PDF file of another sample of the Bisonal variant\n(dfa1ad6083aa06b82edfa672925bb78c16d4e8cb2510cbe18ea1cf598e7f2722) submitted to an online malware database\nin September 2014. This decoy is a contact list of Agriculture, Food, Rural Affairs, Oceans and Fisheries Committee of\nthe National Assembly of the Republic of Korea. According to the metadata, this file is also converted from an HWP\ndocument with same tool by same creator. Though we don’t know whether the creator is real or fake information, we\ncan say the attacker has not changed this tool and technique for years.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8. Metadata in the decoy file_\n\n## Main EXE\n\nThe installed EXE file is almost exactly the same as the DLL version of Bisonal variant used against the Russian\norganization. Following is a brief write-up of the Bisonal EXE’s behavior. There are only three differences from the DLL\nsample; creating a registry entry by itself, the C2 domain and the target or campaign code. The EXE’s behavior is\ndiscussed below.\n\nIt creates the registry entry,\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\”mismyou” = %Temp%[random].tmp\nto achieve persistence. In contrast, the DLL version does not create a registry entry because the dropper of the DLL\ndoes.\nIt decrypts the C2 domain address by using the RC4 cipher with the same key “78563412”.\nIt connects to hxxp://games.my-homeip[.]com:443/ks8d[ip address]akspbu.txt by using the HTTP POST method\nwith the same incomplete User Agent string “Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0; .NET CLR\n1.1.4322”\nIt sends the same initial beacon value of 81b2a8977ea31b91 to the C2 server.\nIt uses a different target or campaign code, “pmo”.\n\n\n-----\n\n|Year|Target Country|Campaign or Target Code|SHA256|Cipher|Bisonal Marker|Cyrillic/ ipconfig check|C2|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|2012|unidentified|1031|43459f5117bee7b49f2cee7ce934471e01fb2aa2856f230943460e14e19183a6|XOR|YES|YES|jennifer998.lookin[.]at, 196.44.49[.]154|\n|2014|South Korea|0919-1|dfa1ad6083aa06b82edfa672925bb78c16d4e8cb2510cbe18ea1cf598e7f2722|RC4|NO|YES|www.hosting.tempors.com|\n|2018|Russia|0425god|1128D10347DD602ECD3228FAA389ADD11415BF6936E2328101311264547AFA75|RC4|NO|YES|kted56erhg.dynssl[.]com, euiro8966.organiccrap[.]com|\n|2018|South Korea|pmo|359835C4A9DBE2D95E483464659744409E877CB6F5D791DAA33FD601A01376FC|RC4|NO|YES|games.my-homeip[.]com|\n\n\n_Table 4 Summary of the Bisonal samples in this blog_\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe attackers behind Bisonal have been active for at least 7 years, and the variant used against the Russian and South\nKorean targets discussed in this blog in the wild since 2014. Since the attackers frequently rewrite functions from\nscratch and avoid reusing infrastructures, some samples look very different from original Bisonal malware. However, as\nwe discussed in this blog, the same original piece of code referencing the malware name “bisonal” remains in at least\nsome samples.\n\nWe are still investigating the connection between the latest attacks discussed in this blog and the previous Bisonal\nattacks reported by industry colleagues. The high-level TTPs of the adversary behind these Bisonal samples matches with\nprevious Bisonal activity. The targets are military or defense industry in particular countries, it used DDNS for C2 servers,\nand tracked connections from their victims by using target or campaign codes, as well as disguising the malware as\ndocument file, and using a dropper to install the malware and decoy file. We currently believe one group is behind these\nattacks, and we continue to investigate.\n\nPalo Alto Networks customers are protected from this threat by:\n\nWildFire detects all Bisonal files with malicious verdicts\n[AutoFocus customers can track these samples with the Bisonal tag](https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.Bisonal)\nTraps blocks all of the files associated with Bisonal\n\n\n-----\n\n0641FE04713FBDAD272A6F8E9B44631B7554DFD1E1332A8AFA767D845A90B3FA\n\n**Bisonal SHA256:**\n\n43459F5117BEE7B49F2CEE7CE934471E01FB2AA2856F230943460E14E19183A6\n\nDFA1AD6083AA06B82EDFA672925BB78C16D4E8CB2510CBE18EA1CF598E7F2722\n\n1128D10347DD602ECD3228FAA389ADD11415BF6936E2328101311264547AFA75\n\n359835C4A9DBE2D95E483464659744409E877CB6F5D791DAA33FD601A01376FC\n\n**C2:**\n\njennifer998.lookin[.]at\n\n196.44.49[.]154\n\nwww.hosting.tempors[.]com\n\nkted56erhg.dynssl[.]com\n\neuiro8966.organiccrap[.]com\n116.193.155[.]38\n\ngames.my-homeip[.]com\n\n##### Got something to say?\n\n\n-----\n\n**Notify me of followup comments via e-mail**\n\n\nName (required)\n\n\nEmail (required)\n\n\nWebsite\n\n\nSUBMIT\n\n\nCOMPANY\n\n[Company](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/company)\n\n[Careers](http://jobs.jobvite.com/paloaltonetworks/)\n\n[Sitemap](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/sitemap)\n\n[Report a Vunerability](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/security-disclosure)\n\n\nLEGAL NOTICES\n\n[Privacy](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/legal-notices/privacy)\n\n[Terms of Use](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/legal-notices/terms-of-use)\n\n[Documents](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/legal-notices)\n\n[GDPR Readiness](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/legal-notices/gdpr)\n\n\nACCOUNT\n\n[Manage a Subscription](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/company/subscriptions)\n\n\n-----\n\n-----",
