The third party has backups with onion service keys,\" a threat actor known as\n\n\n-----\n\n0_neday posted to the hacking forum.\n\nThe threat actor went on to say that they found no signs of compromise to their servers but\nwill be shutting down the operation.\n\nThe threat actor then told affiliates to contact him for campaign decryption keys via Tox, likely\nso affiliates could continue extorting their victims and provide a decryptor if a ransom is paid.\n\n**XSS forum topic about REvil sites being hijacked**\nTo launch a Tor hidden service (an .onion domain), you need to generate a private and public\nkey pair, which is used to initialize the service.\n\nThe private key must be secured and only accessible to trusted admins, as anyone with\naccess to this key could use it to launch the same .onion service on their own server.\n\nAs a third party was able to hijack the domains, it means they too have access to the hidden\nservice's private keys.\n\nThis evening, 0_neday once again posted to the hacking forum topic, but this time saying\nthat their server was compromised and that whoever did it was targeting the threat actor.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Forum post stating the REvil server was compromised**\nAt this time, it is unknown who compromised their servers.\n\nAs Bitdefender and law enforcement gained access to the master REvil decryption key and\n[released a free decryptor, some threat actors believe that the FBI or other law enforcement](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/free-revil-ransomware-master-decrypter-released-for-past-victims/)\nhave had access to the servers since they relaunched.\n\nAs no one knows what happened to Unknown, it is also possible that the threat actor is trying\nto regain control over the operation.\n\n## REvil likely shut down for good\n\nAfter [REvil conducted a massive attack on companies through a zero-day vulnerability in the](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/revil-ransomware-hits-1-000-plus-companies-in-msp-supply-chain-attack/)\nKaseya MSP platform, the REvil operation suddenly shut down, and their public-facing\nrepresentative, Unknown, disappeared.\n\nAfter Unknown did not return, the rest of the REvil operators launched the operation and\nwebsites again in September using backups.\n\nSince then, the ransomware operation has been struggling to recruit users, going as far as\nto [increase affiliate's commissions to 90% to entice other threat actors to work with them.](https://twitter.com/y_advintel/status/1446528895537356825)\n\nWith this latest mishap, the operation in its current forum will likely be gone for good.\n\nHowever, no good thing lasts forever when it comes to ransomware, and we will likely see\nthem rebrand as a new operation shortly.\n\n_Thx to_ _[@_TheEmperors_ for the tip!](https://twitter.com/_TheEmperors_)_\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Darknet market Versus shuts down after hacker leaks security flaw](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/darknet-market-versus-shuts-down-after-hacker-leaks-security-flaw/)\n\n[Conti ransomware shuts down operation, rebrands into smaller units](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/conti-ransomware-shuts-down-operation-rebrands-into-smaller-units/)\n\n[The Week in Ransomware - May 6th 2022 - An evolving landscape](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-week-in-ransomware-may-6th-2022-an-evolving-landscape/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Conti, REvil, LockBit ransomware bugs exploited to block encryption](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/conti-revil-lockbit-ransomware-bugs-exploited-to-block-encryption/)\n\n[REvil ransomware returns: New malware sample confirms gang is back](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/revil-ransomware-returns-new-malware-sample-confirms-gang-is-back/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
