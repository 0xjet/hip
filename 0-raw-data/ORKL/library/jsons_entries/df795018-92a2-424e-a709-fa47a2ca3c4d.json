In the Bahamut report, we documented a capable actor interested in a\ndiverse set of political, economic, and non-governmental targets, which suggested espionage rather\nthan criminal intent. Bahamut was shown to be resourceful, not only maintaining their own Android\nmalware but running propaganda sites, although the quality of these activities varied noticeably.\n\nOur publication on the campaign coincided with a series of defacements and leaked emails related to\nQatar and its neighbors, the same types of targets that arose in our research. While we have found no\nevidence to link the group to these incidents, Bahamut provided a useful window into the activities\nrampant in the Gulf at a time when hacking has contributed to a regional diplomatic crisis. The\nincident further demonstrated the blurred lines in cybersecurity between attacks against human\nrights communities and espionage against diplomats, as well as the potential role of non-state actors\nin state-aligned cyber operations.\n\nAfter publication, the identified operations and malware domains were taken down. For three months\nthere was no apparent further activity from the actor. However, in the same week of September a\nseries of spearphishing attempts once again targeted a set of otherwise unrelated individuals,\nemploying the same tactics as before. Bahamut remains active, and its operations are more extensive\nthan first disclosed. Our primary contribution in this update is to implicate Bahamut in what are likely\ncounterterrorism-motivated surveillance operations, and to further affirm our belief that the group is a\nhacker-for-hire operation. Toward this we document a previously unnoticed link with a campaign\ntargeting South Asia that was published last year. This post extends the previous publication with\nrecent activity and lends more evidence to our past hypotheses about the political nature of its\noperations.\n\n### Overlap with Previous Campaigns\n\n\n-----\n\nlarger targeting of the attacks, the credential theft operations were found to cover a broad range of\ninterests in the Middle East, such as Turkish diplomats and Iranian political figures in the lead up to\nthe recent presidential election. As we noted then, these incidents stood out because they exceeded\nthe level of care and preparation seen in the everyday cybercrime. In our report, we also noted a\nsimilarity to the “Operation Kingphish” (http://medium.com/amnesty-insights/operation-kingphishuncovering-a-campaign-of-cyber-attacks-against-civil-society-in-qatar-and-aa40c9e08852)\ncampaign published by Amnesty International earlier this year. As we wrote then, compared to\nKingphish, Bahamut “operates as though it were a generation ahead in terms of professionalism and\nambition.”\n\nA more recent credential theft attempt provided the most credible link between the two campaigns\nthus far, and bolsters our hypothesis that the operations are related. Among a flurry of spearphishing\nattempts associated with Bahamut in recent weeks, one fake Google message directed its target to a\nunique domain (string2port[.]com) to steal login credentials. The string2port domain (registered in\nMay 2016) strongly reflects the ping2port[.]info domain (registered in September 2016) that was used\nin Kingphish against Qatar-focused labor rights advocates. The ping2port domain is now pending\ndeletion – abandoned due to discovery – but the previously unnoticed and related string2port has\nbeen reused. Given the similarities in tactics, administration of infrastructure, domains, and other\nfactors, it appears increasingly clear both campaigns against Middle Eastern diplomats and those\ndirected against human rights advocates are connected.\n\nThe similarities to other research is not limited to Kingphish, and includes a prolific campaign in\nSouth Asia. In our original post we noted that an expansive operation was evident from a search of\npotential domains based on common pattern in domain registration and hosting behavior (an AngloEuropean name sometimes followed by a number at mail.ru, often also found in the DNS ‘Start of\nAuthority’ record). Here too, we find multiple other candidate domains based on simple search\npatterns, although other email providers such as Pobox.sk are now more common. While we published\na number of domain names that were clearly malicious and similar to Bahamut, we did not post the\nfull list out of a concern of false positives. Included in these results was a domain i3mode[.]com,\nwhich used a Mail.ru contact email and was hosted on a network found in other Bahamut\nspearphishing attempts.\n\nWhois (i3mode[.]com):\n\n\nRegistrant Name: KEDRICK BROWN\nRegistrant Phone: +503.503226605642\nRegistrant Email: KEDRICK.BROWN.84@MAIL.RU\n\n\nThis domain appears in Kaspersky’s blog post “ (https://securelist.com/inpage-zero-day-exploit-usedto-attack-financial-institutions-in-asia/76717/)InPage zero-day exploit used to attack financial\n[institutions in Asia” (https://securelist.com/inpage-zero-day-exploit-used-to-attack-financial-](https://securelist.com/inpage-zero-day-exploit-used-to-attack-financial-institutions-in-asia/76717/)\ninstitutions-in-asia/76717/) from November 2016. That campaign targeted financial institutions with\nmalware that took advantage of a vulnerability in text processing software popular with Urdu and\nArabic speaking users. The domains in the InPage campaign match the same pattern of registration\nand hosting within Bahamut. The Urdu connection recalls our identification of Android malware\nposing as a Urdu Quranic reference. This thematic overlap also includes a relevant sample “Analysis\n\n\n-----\n\nanother subdomain that appeared to reference an Indian business newspaper (“mint-newsportal.hymnfork.com”).\n\nThis faint connection in domains and similar interests provides a first hint that Bahamut is more\nactive than we were previously aware and bolsters our hypothesis that the group is a hackers-for-hire\noperation.\n\n### Malware Campaigns in South Asia\n\nIn the Bahamut report, we discussed two domains found within our search that were linked with a\ncustom Android malware agent. This connection between the malware and credential theft was\nreinforced by some similarities in how the agent reported back to the attacker’s servers, and thus we\nfelt moderately confident about a link between the credential theft and the malware. After the\npublication of the original report, these sites were taken offline despite the fact that one agent was\neven updated a six days prior to our post (the “Khuai” application). Additionally, antivirus engines\nbegan to detect copies of this malware based on common patterns in development, including apps\nthat we were not aware of. Based on a search of public sources, we find three more malicious\napplications focused mostly on South Asia, including samples uploaded from India.\n\n\n-----\n\n(https://017qndpynh\nflywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/devoted.png)\nIncluded in the newly detected apps was one named “Devoted to Humanity,” which has been taken\ndown from the Play Store (devoted.to.humanity). Based on the name and domains used in the\ncommunications (“devotedtohumanity-fif[.]info”, which was registered in March 2016), it appears that\nthe application impersonates the “Falah-e-Insaniat Foundation” (FIF) that ostensibly operates as a\nreligious charity primarily in Pakistan. FIF is notable for its links to the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) terrorist\norganization, which has committed mass-casualty attacks in India in support of establishing Pakistani\ncontrol over the disputed Jammu and Kashmir border region. As a result of its connections to LeT and\ninternational pressure to crack down on Kashmiri jihadists, Pakistan placed FIF under on a terrorism\nwatch list in January 2017 (https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/222203-Pakistan-says-FIF-to-be\n\n-----\n\nintelligence motive for Bahamut’s espionage.\n\nThe “Devoted to Humanity” app also references an image hosted on domain voguextra[.]com, which\nappears to have been used to stage decoy documents\n(https://www.virustotal.com/#/url/a65bcd077ea0c098ae0bc88414a38f2cf4333cae40d704eb88dfa043\n\n(https://017qndpynh-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp\ncontent/uploads/2017/10/gps.png)\nThe Falah-e-Insaniat Foundation app is not the only Kashmir-related campaign associated with\nBahamut. Pivoting off the unique contact information used to register the FIF domain, “adgnad\n[dangda” and “adgnad@mail.ru (mailto:adgnad@mail.ru)”, we also find two more (“Android-Cloud.net”](mailto:adgnad@mail.ru)\nand “Kashmir-Weather-Info.com”) that were cohosted on the same server as the FIF site. The Kashmir\nWeather domain corresponds with a now-removed Android application with the similar set of\npermissions and tactics found in the previous malware (com.weather.kashmir). The purpose of the\n“Android-Cloud.net” domain is not currently known.\n\nIt is important to note that the domains had lapsed and were re-registered since they were first used.\nSo while they appear to be malicious, the current custody is unclear. The domains now purport\n(https://web.archive.org/web/20171025013449/http:/Kashmir-Weather-Info.com) to be for a\nplatform “Donkey Service” (“DoDoDonkey”), which provides a less than credible pitch:\n\n\n-----\n\n_We just get clean requests and never have to deal with malicious traffic or attacks on the_\n_Mobile infrastructure. We are the perfect partner for our business!_\n\n\nMuch of this text is copied from a customer quote about Cloudflare\n(https://web.archive.org/web/20171025013327/https:/www.cloudflare.com/gimlet/).\n\n(https://017qndpynh-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/mxi.png)\nAs with the “Khuai” Chinese-English translator malware in the previous post, other identified agents\nhave unclear targets, such as the “MXI Player” that was last updated August 2017 (mxiplayer[.]com).\nMXI Player appears to be a version of the Bahamut agent, designed to record the phone calls and\ncollect other information about the user (com.mxi.videoplay). After having been kicked off Play Store\nseveral times, it appears that Bahamut is now hosting its agent on the APKPure alternative app store.\nHowever, the malware retains certain design choices seen in previous attacks, for example around\nencryption and communications with the attacker server. As a result, it is already flagged as Bahamut\nby antivirus engines.\n\nMore interestingly, the MXI Player site also includes a Windows version of the application, which is a\nrebranded media player that also installs a malware agent posing as a software updater\n(mxiupdate.exe). A full write up of the Windows malware is not in scope of this article for the sake of\nbrevity and our intended contribution. A hash for the malware agent is provided in the appendix for\nthose interested. A cursory inspection of debugging artifacts and other details, such as an embedded\nfilesystem path referring to a template code project (“EmbeddedAssembly_1.3”), suggests that the\nagent is both rudimentary and custom designed.\n\nOne important trait worth noting is that the Windows malware’s communications strongly resembles\n\n\n-----\n\nBahamut’s Mixi Player malware (mxiplayer[.]com):\n\n\n/hdhfdhffjvfjd/gfdhghfdjhvbd�hj.php?p=1&g=[string]&v=N/A&s=[string]&t=[string]\n\n\nInPageCampaign malware (encrypzi[.]com):\n\n\n/fdjgwsdjgbfv/dbzkfgdkgbv�b.php?p=1&g=[string]&v=0&s=[string]\n\n\nThese repeated parallels further indicate a relationship between the Android malware operations and\nthe InPage-related espionage. In review, these connections include:\n\nOverlap between the extended network of domains relevant to Bahamut’s credential theft\ninfrastructure and malware domains in Kaspersky’s report;\n\nSimilarity in the format of beacons between Bahamut’s Windows agent and malware associated\nwith the InPage domains, and to a lesser extent even in the Android agent; and,\n\nCommonalities in targeted interests, namely the contested Kashmir region.\n\nOne curious trait of Bahamut is that it develops fully-functional applications in support of its\nespionage activities, rather than push nonfunctional fake apps or bundle malware with legitimate\nsoftware. These include translation and weather applications that involved requests to third-party\nAPIs and other user interactions. While much of the code appears to be copied and these applications\nare simple, Bahamut must spend a fair amount of time on operations that target a small number of\nindividuals. The content and app market descriptions of the three Android applications also recalls our\nprevious observation that the Bahamut actor appears to be fluent in English, albeit constrained either\ndue to not being native speakers or lack of professionalism.\n\n### Credential Theft in the Middle East\n\nBahamut has taken a more concerted effort to reduce exposure of their operations, preventing the\nresearch techniques that led to our cataloguing of their infrastructure and operations in the first post.\nOnce again, the attempts all originate from less reputable hosting companies and networks\n(AS44901, BelCloud Hosting Corporation). Spearphishing pages are now more resistant to\nenumeration attempts and appear to use a dedicated subdomain for one specific victim. The unique\nsubdomain appears to be automatically disabled after the “successful” phishing attempt in order to\ncover the trail of the attack (redirecting the user elsewhere or appearing to be a Google error page).\nThese pages have also increased their use of unicode replacements for letters and other font tricks as\na way to evade network filters or to deceive users (e.g. using r and n, “rn”, to appear like the letter “m”).\nAltogether an already stealthy actor has improved their operational profile.\n\n\n-----\n\n(https://017qndpynh-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/google-verify.png)\n\n(https://017qndpynh-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/elseif.png)\nCuriously, Bahamut appears to track password attempts in response to failed phishing attempts or to\nprovoke the target to provide more passwords. These passwords are hardcoded in the phishing page\nso that the login form will immediately return a “bad password” message if entered. This could be\ndesigned to trick the user into providing older passwords or alternative passwords used on other\nplatforms to provide a foothold into other services. The result is that Bahamut spearphishing pages\ninclude over two hundred possible real world passwords that appear to cover at least a couple of\ndozen likely victims.\n\nThe theme of the passwords provide indication of the types of targets and victims of Bahamut since\nour last encounter. Most of the domains clearly reflect a Middle Eastern audience, including referring\n\n\n-----\n\nArab countries. Further demonstrating its focus on the Middle East, the phishing page specifically\n(and exclusively) checks if the visitor’s browser is set to the Arabic language and redirects them to a\ntranslated page. Where targets are personally identifiable, these campaigns reflect an intimate\nunderstanding of the relationships and members of the policy and international relations sectors of\ncertain Gulf states – information that would not be readily accessible to a bystander, and targets that\nwould not be of interest outside of political motivations.\n\nThe recent incidents also involved a social engineering tactic well documented in the Kingphish\nreport: fictitious social media profiles. In Kingphish, a profile active on LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook\n(purporting to be an IT and business professional) approached labor rights advocates requesting help\non research about human trafficking.\n\nSimilarly, a [fictitious LinkedIn profile (https://www.linkedin.com/in/sophie-foster-65920b147/)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sophie-foster-65920b147/)\nnamed “Sophie Foster” attempted to simultaneously approach multiple targets of Bahamut’s phishing\nmessages. The Foster profile appears crafted for a professional Middle East related demographic,\nclaiming to have experience in public relations and international trade. Among connections to SOAS\nand LSE students, which appear to be cover related to her claimed educational background, the\nprofile has a clear theme in targets: journalists and public relations professionals in the Middle East,\nincluding individuals at Sky News Arabia and Al-Masry Al-Youm, and others in Egypt, Lebanon, Saudi,\nUAE, and Turkey. A two-year old Facebook profile exists (https://www.facebook.com/people/SophieFoster/100019404465464) for the persona, which has liked pages for Lebanese politicians and has a\nMail.ru account linked to it.\n\n\n-----\n\n(https://017qndpynh-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/sophie.png)\nBahamut spearphishing attempts have also been accompanied with SMS messages purporting to be\nfrom Google about security issues on their account, including a class 0 message or “flash text.”\n(http://devlib.symbian.slions.net/s3/GUID-CBFDD753-BAE3-5C40-B947-EB8CDA11CD23.html)\nThese text messages did not include links but are intended to build credibility around the fake service\nnotifications later sent to the target’s email address. The use of fake sender identifiers – especially\ncombined with the unusual flash text approach – could be effective, but once again Bahamut is\nbetrayed by its unusual English.\n\nBahamut also appears to be more aggressive in reconnaissance against targets. As it harvested\npotential addresses associated with targets, it would sended tailored or salacious messages with\n\n\n-----\n\n(e.g. Al Monitor) relevant to the region.\n\n(https://017qndpynh-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/fakemeails.jpg)\n### Conclusion and Implications\n\nGiven our increased confidence that Bahamut was responsible for targeting of Qatari labor rights\nadvocates and its focus on the foreign policy institutions other Gulf states, Bahamut’s interests are\nseemingly too expansive to be limited one sponsor or customer. However, those targets fall within\ncoherent themes. It is unclear which single client could be interested in both a Kashmiri organization\non a terrorism watchlist and Egyptian journalists. Thus far, Bahamut’s campaigns have appeared to be\nprimarily espionage or information operations – not destructive attacks or fraud. The targets and\nthemes of Bahamut’s campaigns have consistently fallen within two regions – South Asia (primarily\nPakistan, specifically Kashmir) and the Middle East (from Morocco to Iran). The targeting of\norganizations scrutinized ties to terrorism raises the stakes for the operation, and differentiate it from\nusual cybercrime. Targets outside of the Middle East tend to still have associations to Middle Eastern\nissues, such as a European investment firm active in a Gulf country and a foreign policy experts in the\nWest. We have not found evidence of Bahamut engaging in crime or operating outside its limited\ngeographic domains, although this narrow perspective could be accounted for by its\ncompartmentalization of operations.\n\nThere remains ample questions and research opportunities to be explored. While Bahamut has\nleveraged resources in Urdu and Arabic, it appears to be most comfortable in the English language\ndespite its uncommon grammar. While we note malicious domains that maintain a similar profile to\nBahamut that impersonate Qatari government email services, we have not found a direct connection\nto those campaigns, and there has been little indication of the targeting of Qatar within our\nmonitoring. We have not fully explored the extent of Bahamut’s operations, such as its Windows\nmalware agent or possible other Android malware. Moreover, the networks and tactics used within\nBahamut’s operations turn up suspicious sites that resemble the Times of Arab operation disclosed\npreviously – often Middle East focused news published in English that recirculate content on\ntechnology and politics with no clear attribution or purpose. These suspicious sites and those we can\naccount for as Bahamut repeatedly turn up a nexus with India, more so than the Middle East, despite\nattempts by the attackers to stay anonymous. Once again, our investigation only seems to be a limited\nwindow into a strange operation.\n\nThe proposition that a non-state hacker-for-hire operation could be used in pursuit of regional state\ninterests is not unusual. At this point most Middle Eastern governments have at least once procured\n\n\n-----\n\n5ff056538b7c_story.html?utm_term=.a1a5dd6c70e3) – a deal that was quashed by the U.S.\ngovernment. This reliance on contractors could indicate that such countries have been unable to\ndevelop their own in-house capacity, which would align with their general reliance on foreign military\nfirms (http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/15/world/middleeast/15prince.html). It is also worth noting\nthat while some government agencies may have acquired tools already, other entities such as local\npolice might still desire their own capabilities leading to overlaps. On the vendor side, in recent years\ncompanies such as the Indian-firm Aglaya have been implicated in selling full hacking as a service\n[(https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/d7ywvx/leaked-catalog-weaponized-information-](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/d7ywvx/leaked-catalog-weaponized-information-twitter-aglaya)\ntwitter-aglaya), rather than simply providing tools for government use. This parallels the unclear lines\nbetween cybercrime and espionage seen elsewhere, and hints that mercenary cyber operations are\nmore common than currently understood. Thus Bahamut warrants attention as an emblematic case of\nthe interest in cyber espionage in places such as the Middle East and the range of vendors willing to\nmeet that demand.\n\n### Acknowledgement\n\nWe appreciate the help from Tom Lancaster, who noticed the overlap with Kaspersky’s InPage report\nand an additional Android malware agent. Our prior publication also failed to acknowledge immensely\nvaluable input from a number of colleagues, including Nadim Kobeissi’s feedback on how the API\nendpoints on the Android malware were encrypted.
