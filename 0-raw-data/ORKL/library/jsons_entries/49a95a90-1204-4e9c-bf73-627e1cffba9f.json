In a recent campaign, the group was\nobserved making use of a new version of the IRC botnet, PwnRig cryptocurrency miner, and\nits generic infection script.\n\n8220 Gang is one of the many low-skill crimeware gangs we continually observe infecting\n[cloud hosts and operating a botnet and cryptocurrency miners through known vulnerabilities](https://www.sentinelone.com/cybersecurity-101/botnets/)\nand remote access brute forcing infection vectors. While the group has operated for years,\n[by mid 2021, the botnet was observed operating with roughly 2000 hosts globally. This](https://web.archive.org/web/20210910064125/https://www.lacework.com/blog/8220-gangs-recent-use-of-custom-miner-and-botnet/)\nmonth, we observed new campaigns utilizing long-running sets of infrastructure, bringing the\nbotnet numbers up to today’s figure of around 30,000 infected hosts.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Who Are the 8220 Gang?\n\n[8220 Gang, also known as 8220 Mining Group, was first publicly reported by Talos in 2018.](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/12/cryptomining-campaigns-2018.html)\nThe name 8220 Gang comes from the group’s original use of port 8220 for C2 network\ncommunications. The group has evolved somewhat from their original interests and the use\nof “WhatMiner”, which was forked from another group known as Rocke. The targeting of\nDocker, Hadoop, Redis, Drupal, and other services has been a continuing trend since their\nfirst discovery. Based on Talos’ discovery of Github repository details and infrastructure, the\ngroup is believed to be a Chinese-speaking threat actor.\n\nVictims of 8220 Gang are typically, but not exclusively, users of cloud networks operating\nvulnerable and misconfigured Linux applications and services. Attacks make use of SSH\nbrute forcing post-infection to automate local and global spreading attempts. Victims using\ncloud infrastructure (AWS, Azure, GCP, Aliyun, QCloud) are often infected via publicly\naccessible hosts running Docker, Confluence, Apache WebLogic, and Redis. Victims are not\ntargeted geographically, but simply identified by their internet accessibility. At the time of\nwriting, roughly 30,000 systems globally have been potentially infected with the 8220 Gang\nbotnet.\n\n## 8220 Cloud Botnet Infection Script\n\nThe infection script acts as the main code for the botnet to operate. Despite its lack of\ndetection evasion or obfuscation, the script appears to be highly effective at infecting targets.\nThe core functionality of the script has been widely reported on for a number of years as it\n\n\n-----\n\nhas been reused by many amateur cryptocurrency mining groups and profit-seeking\nindividuals. For that reason, researchers must be wary of attributing the script in its entirety\nto 8220 Gang.\n\nWe can summarize the script’s actions into the following buckets:\n\n1. Victim host preparation and cleanup, including the removal of common cloud security\n\ntools.\n2. IRC Botnet malware and miner download/configuration and remediation persistence.\n3. Tsunami IRC Botnet malware sample validation and connectivity.\n4. Internal network SSH scanner with lateral spreading capability.\n5. PwnRig cryptocurrency miner execution.\n6. Local SSH key collection, connectivity testing, and lateral spreading.\n\nThe script is notoriously ugly and often contains unused or outdated functions, allowing trivial\ntracking over time.\n\nNew and Old SSH\n\nScanning Functions\n8220 Gang and other groups who make use of this same infection script can be observed\nchanging it multiple times a month. In late June 2022, the group began making use of a\nseparate file they call “Spirit” to manage some of the SSH brute forcing functionality outside\nof the script. Spirit contains a list of approximately 450 hardcoded credentials for SSH brute\nforcing. The list includes combinations of the root username, and default Linux device and\napplication passwords.\n\n\n-----\n\nAnother evolution example is the use of block lists. 8220 Gang and others make use of block\nlists in the infection script to avoid infecting specific hosts, such as researcher honeypots,\nwhich may place their illicit efforts at risk. The method of implementing the block list has\nshifted from direct IPs listed in the script to a list in an additionally-downloaded file. The\nmethod of calling the list in the script varies across implementations.\n\nExample of blocklist functionality in recent infection scripts\nWhat we can conclude is that the trivial design of the script allows for simple attacker\nexperimentation, and it should not surprise researchers when specific functionality is added\nor reorganized.\n\n## Updated PwnRig Miner\n\n[PwnRig is a custom version of the open source XMRig miner that gained its name based on](https://web.archive.org/web/20210910064125/https://www.lacework.com/blog/8220-gangs-recent-use-of-custom-miner-and-botnet/)\nstrings the author used in its early versions. More recent versions of PwnRig continue to\nmake use of the same author name, while some functionality of the miner has been updated.\n\nPwnRig Miner Execution Options – XMRig Variant\nOne of the notable features of PwnRig is the fake pool request for government domains.\nEarly 2021 versions made use of `fbi.gov ; however, the latest version uses` `fbi.gov.br`\nand `161.148.164.31 . While the FBI subdomain is not real, the IP address is the active IP`\nhosting the `gov.br domain – the true Brazil federal government domain.`\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOver the past few years 8220 Gang has slowly evolved their simple, yet effective, Linux\ninfection scripts to expand a botnet and illicit cryptocurrency miner. From our observations\nthe group has made changes over the recent weeks to expand the botnet to nearly 30,000\n\n\n-----\n\nvictims globally. PwnRig, the IRC Botnet, and generic infection script are all incredibly simple\nand used opportunistically in the groups targeting.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n**Indicator**
