Despite taking basic operational security measures\n\nthrough changing the resolution status of command and control (C2)\n\ndomains in the immediate aftermath of this reporting, the group’s tactics,\n\ntechniques, and procedures (TTPs) remained consistent. RedDelta’s\n\npersistence is exemplified through resuming its targeting of both the\n\nVatican and the Catholic Diocese of Hong Kong mail servers within two\n\nweeks of the report publication. More widely, there has been new activity\n\nthat we attribute to the group in the form of PlugX samples featuring\n\ndecoy documents themed around Catholicism, Tibet-Ladakh relations,\n\nand the United Nations General Assembly Security Council, as well as\n\nadditional network intrusion activity targeting Myanmar government\n\nsystems and two Hong Kong universities.\n\n###### Key Judgments\n\n  - RedDelta continues to operate in line with Chinese strategic\n\npriorities. This is further exemplified by the group’s continued\n\ntargeting of the Vatican and Hong Kong Catholic Diocese,\n\nand the use of targeted decoy documents centered on topical\n\ngeopolitical issues of concern to the People’s Republic of\n\nChina (PRC), such as Catholicism within China and Tibet\nLadakh relations, in a manner consistent with cyberespionage\n\noperations.\n\n\n\n  - The group’s reuse of publicly reported infrastructure and TTPs is\n\nlikely indicative of a group experiencing operational success and\n\nhighlights a pragmatic approach to operational security, with\n\nRedDelta willing to continue to use publicly known infrastructure\n\nas long as access is maintained.\n\n###### Background\n\nOn July 28, 2020, Insikt Group [published research identifying](https://www.recordedfuture.com/reddelta-targets-catholic-organizations/)\n\nthat the Vatican and the Catholic Diocese of Hong Kong were among\n\nseveral Catholic Church-related organizations targeted by the suspected\n\nChinese-state sponsored threat activity group RedDelta. This series\n\nof suspected network intrusions also targeted the Hong Kong Study\n\nMission to China and The Pontifical Institute for Foreign Missions (PIME),\n\nItaly. Insikt Group assessed that the targeting of entities related to the\n\nCatholic church is likely indicative of Communist Party of China (CCP)\n\nobjectives in consolidating control over the “underground” Catholic\n\n[church, “sinicizing religions” in China, and diminishing the perceived](https://thediplomat.com/2017/10/chinese-communist-party-vows-to-sinicize-religions-in-china/)\n\ninfluence of the Vatican within China’s Catholic community.\n\nIn addition to the targeting of entities related to the Catholic\n\nChurch, Insikt Group also identified network intrusions impacting law\n\nenforcement and government entities in India, a government organization\n\nin Indonesia, and other unidentified targets across Myanmar, Hong Kong,\n\nand Australia. In this activity the group used multiple malware variants,\n\nincluding a customized PlugX variant referred to as “RedDelta PlugX,”\n\nCobalt Strike Beacon, and Poison Ivy.\n\n###### Threat Analysis\n\n RedDelta Cleaning Up Post-Publication\n\nFollowing the publication of the original RedDelta report on July\n\n28, 2020, the group took a number of evasive steps related to the\n\ninfrastructure used in the intrusions, including changing IP resolutions\n\nacross several of the identified command and control (C2) domains. For\n\nexample, less than one day after publication of the RedDelta research,\n\nall of the C2 subdomains identified within the “Poison Ivy/Cobalt Strike”\n\ncluster stopped resolving.\n\n###### Subdomain Previous Hosting IP Address\n\nweb.miscrosaft[.]com 154.213.21[.]207\n\nlib.jsquerys[.]net 154.213.21[.]70\n\nlib.hostareas[.]com 154.213.21[.]73\n\n_Table 1: “Poison Ivy Cluster” domains that stopped resolving the day after report_\n_publication._\n\nAdditionally, the hosting IP for the PlugX C2 domain cabsecnow[.]\n\ncom was switched from 167.88.180[.]32 to 103.85.24[.]149 on August\n\n3, 2020. However, this was not the case for all of the identified\n\ninfrastructure. Many of the PlugX C2 servers remained live and continued\n\nto be used across several of the intrusions identified within the initial\n\nreport. This contrast highlights the group’s willingness to continue to use\n\npublicly known infrastructure as long as access is maintained.\n\n|Subdomain|Previous Hosting IP Address|\n|---|---|\n|web.miscrosaft[.]com|154.213.21[.]207|\n|lib.jsquerys[.]net|154.213.21[.]70|\n|lib.hostareas[.]com|154.213.21[.]73|\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1: Network traffic between Catholic Diocese of Hong Kong and RedDelta C2 infrastructure._\n\n###### RedDelta Resumes Its Targeting of the Vatican and Hong Kong Catholic Diocese\n\nIn analyzing communications between targeted organizations and RedDelta\n\nC2 infrastructure using Recorded Future Network Traffic Analysis, we identified\n\nthat the network communications between Catholic church organizations ceased\n\nin the immediate aftermath of the report publication. However, this was short\nlived, and within 10 days, the group returned to its targeting of the Hong Kong\n\nCatholic Diocese mail server, and within 14 days, a Vatican mail server. This is\n\nindicative of RedDelta’s persistence in maintaining access to these environments\n\nfor gathering intelligence, in addition to the group’s aforementioned high risk\n\ntolerance.\n\n_Figure 2: Timeline of Recent RedDelta activity. (Source: Recorded Future)_\n\n\n[On September 10, 2020, China’s Foreign Ministry announced that the 2018](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/chinas-foreign-ministry-vatican-deal-has-been-implemented-successfully-76242)\n\nPRC-Holy See deal had been “implemented successfully”, with a renewal of the deal\n\n[expected to be announced in the coming weeks. The timing of this announcement](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-09/vatican-china-set-to-renew-deal-on-long-path-to-diplomatic-ties)\n\nwas preceded by RedDelta activity targeting the Vatican network dying down one\n\n[week prior, and follows a Rome visit in late August from Chinese foreign minister](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-italy-wang/senior-chinese-diplomat-wang-yi-says-must-avoid-a-new-cold-war-idUSKBN25L1PM)\n\nWang Yi, suggesting that the group’s intelligence tasking requirement may have\n\nbeen achieved or no longer required. In the interim period since our previous\n\nreport, it is unclear whether the group was able to successfully regain access to\n\nthe Vatican network. However, the attempts to do so, followed by the emergence\n\nof new RedDelta Catholic church-themed lure documents, again highlight the\n\nCCP’s focus on gaining increased oversight of the Catholic community within\n\nChina.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Further Targeting in Line With Chinese Strategic Interests\n\nRedDelta continues to target organizations aligned with China’s strategic\n\nand geopolitical interests. In previous reporting, we linked a series of network\n\nintrusions and phishing attempts targeting several Catholic church organizations\n\nto the group, which took place in advance of talks between the two states ahead of\n\nthe anticipated renewal of the 2018 China-Holy See deal. In the interim period, the\n\ngroup has used additional lures referencing Catholics within China, Tibet-Ladakh\n\nrelations, and the United Nations General Assembly Security Council to attempt\n\nto load PlugX on target machines.\n\n_Figure 3: “History of Tibet-Ladakh Relations and Their Modern Implications” PlugX decoy document._\n\n\nThe first sample is loaded in a similar manner as the samples described within\n\nthe previous RedDelta report. The first-stage DLL side-loading phase again uses\n\na legitimate Microsoft Word executable to side-load a first-stage DLL loader, with\n\nboth files initially stored inside a zip file. On this occasion, the zip file appears\n\nto have been stored on Google Drive, with the user likely directed to download it\n\nvia a spearphishing link. Following the first DLL side-loading phase, an encrypted\n\nPlugX DAT payload is retrieved from http://103.85.24[.]161/8.dat.\n\n\n-----\n\n_(malicious first-stage side-loaded DLL)_\n\n_Table 2: Contents of “History of Tibet-Ladakh Relations and Their Modern Implications.zip” for first_\n_stage DLL side-loading._\n\nUnlike previously identified RedDelta PlugX samples, this\n\none uses a legitimate Avast Proxy executable for the second\n\nDLL side-loading phase rather than the legitimate Adobe\n\nexecutable used in previously analyzed samples. When loaded\n\ninto memory, the PlugX payload uses www.systeminfor[.]com\n\nfor command and control — the same domain used across\n\nthe Catholic church-themed PlugX samples. Across all four\n\nnewly analyzed samples, the first stage DLL loader files\n\nshare an identical, uncommon import hash and rich header\n\nwith previously observed first stage RedDelta PlugX DLLs.\n\nThe loaded PlugX payload also matches the custom RedDelta\n\nPlugX variant previously described, using RC4 encryption for\n\nC2 communications with the same hardcoded RC4 passphrase\n\nand configuration block decoding function.\n\nIn this sample, the user is shown a decoy document\n\ntitled “History of Tibet-Ladakh Relations and Their Modern\n\nImplications,” as shown in Figure 3. Although the specific\n\ntargeting of this sample is unclear, the inclusion of the\n\n[reference to Ladakh is particularly interesting given the recent](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-53061476)\n\n[escalation in border tensions between China and India across](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-53061476)\n\nthis region, while Tibet remains a frequent target of Chinese\n\nstate-sponsored cyberespionage. Similar to several other\n\nRedDelta samples, the content of the decoy document is taken\n\n[from legitimate sources, in this case from a July 2020 article](https://thediplomat.com/2020/07/history-of-tibet-ladakh-relations-and-their-modern-implications/)\n\nby the Asia-Pacific current affairs news site, The Diplomat.\n\nThe second PlugX sample is loaded in an almost identical\n\nmanner to the Tibet-Ladakh one above, in this case retrieving\n\nthe encrypted PlugX DAT payload from http://103.85.24[.]158/\n\neeas.dat. The sample uses the same Adobe executable\n\nvulnerable to DLL side-loading seen in one of the Catholic\n\nchurch PlugX samples, and uses the Avast Proxy executable\n\nseen in the above Tibet-Ladakh sample for the second stage\n\nside-loading. On this occasion, the zip file appears to have\n\nbeen stored on Dropbox, and again, was likely delivered\n\nthrough spearphishing containing a malicious link. This PlugX\n\nsample again uses www.systeminfor[.]com for command and\n\ncontrol.\n\n_Figure 4: “Advance version of the 2020 Report of the Secretary-General on Peacebuilding and Sustaining Peace” PlugX decoy_\n_document snippet._\n\n|File Name|SHA256 Hash|\n|---|---|\n|History of Tibet-Ladakh Relations and Their Modern Implications.zip|ca59ad2becdfba8f308264ec336b07b­ c415ea34f36d9e84228eda97cd8f7ef5c|\n|History of Tibet-Ladakh Relations and Their Modern Implications.exe|6c959cfb001fbb900958441dfd8b262fb33e­ 052342948bab338775d3e83ef7f7 (legitimate Microsoft Word executable vulnerable to DLL side-loading)|\n|wwlib.dll|039bbe3f1d84efe3546f329aa1e4a42426c­ be7950f68caed3dfe85cca9b6ebe0 (malicious first-stage side-loaded DLL)|\n\n\n-----\n\n(malicious first stage side-loaded DLL)\n\n_Table 3: Contents of “Advance version of the 2020 Report of the Secretary-General on_\n_Peacebuilding and Sustaining Peace.zip” for first stage DLL side-loading._\n\n\nThe 18-page decoy document used in this sample (shown in Figure 4) purports\n\nto be an advanced unedited copy of the “2020 Report of the Secretary-General\n\non Peacebuilding and Sustaining Peace” authored by the United Nations General\n\nAssembly Secretary-General. However, the legitimate report was most likely\n\nobtained from the United Nations [website and doctored to add the “Advanced](https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N20/203/77/pdf/N2020377.pdf?OpenElement)\n\nUnedited Edition” classification and to change the date. The legitimate report was\n\nreleased on August 4, 2020, ahead of the Seventy-Fifth session of the General\n\nAssembly due to [take place in October. On its website, the UN](https://www.un.org/en/ga/sixth/75/75_session.shtml) [states that the](https://www.un.org/peacebuilding/content/2020-review-un-peacebuilding-architecture)\n\npaper will be the principal input into the 2020 Review of the UN Peacebuilding\n\nArchitecture and that the report is being prepared by a core group of UN entities.\n\nWhile the specific target of this particular sample is unclear, the use of public\n\ndocuments based on topical geopolitical issues as decoys has previously been\n\nseen in multiple RedDelta lures. Additionally, the DAT payload filename seen in this\n\nsample, titled eeas.dat, is possibly in reference to the European External Action\n\nService (EEAS), the diplomatic service and combined foreign and defence ministry\n\nof the European Union. Mustang Panda, a closely overlapping threat activity group,\n\n[has also previously used a United Nations Security Council-themed lure in historic](https://www.anomali.com/blog/china-based-apt-mustang-panda-targets-minority-groups-public-and-private-sector-organizations)\n\nactivity.\n\n|File Name|SHA256 Hash|\n|---|---|\n|Advance version of the 2020 Report of the Secretary-General on Peacebuilding and Sustaining Peace.zip|4f29180005f3c2e­ 776d1854722270287111ec073ab80dfc1b­ 4dc1bc0d9337ddf|\n|Advance version of the 2020 Report of the Secretary-General on Peacebuilding and Sustaining Peace.exe|c21bfc263890f02763f56b4e9f5cf­ 9113656cf09d7864b53ec2fd2024b­ dadd60 (legitimate Adobe executable vulnerable to DLL side-loading)|\n|acrord32.dll|eef56bfc68959c6eaa66ab6abcaaf8f­ b54aa5b5a7da0866d97a1effeae0952b8 (malicious first stage side-loaded DLL)|\n\n\n-----\n\nThe final two RedDelta PlugX samples again closely resemble the others,\n\nboth retrieving the DAT payload from http://103.85.24[.]158/hk097.dat, before\n\nultimately using quochoice[.]com for command and control.

Both Hong Kong and\n\nMyanmar have been historical targets of the closely overlapping group Mustang\n\n[Panda (1,2). In the interim period, we identified PlugX (C2 103.85.24[.]149) network](https://www.anomali.com/blog/china-based-apt-mustang-panda-targets-minority-groups-public-and-private-sector-organizations)\n\nintrusions likely targeting government systems in Myanmar that we attribute to\n\nRedDelta. This included a VPN login portal for a Myanmar government electronic\n\ndocument management system. We believe RedDelta conducted this activity\n\nfrom August 4 (and possibly earlier) through at least September 2, 2020. Access\n\nto these systems would likely be a valuable intelligence source for accessing\n\nelectronic documents stored on the system.\n\nIn addition to this new victim within Myanmar, we identified additional PlugX\n\n(C2 85.209.43[.]21 network intrusions likely targeting two Hong Kong universities.\n\nThis IP address currently hosts the domain ipsoftwarelabs[.]com, which was\n\n[previously noted within reporting on activity targeting Hong Kong using an older](https://insights.oem.avira.com/new-wave-of-plugx-targets-hong-kong/)\n\nPlugX variant. While metadata alone does not confirm a compromise, we believe\n\nthat both the high volume and repeated communications from hosts within these\n\ntargeted organizations to these C2s are sufficient to indicate a likely intrusion.\n\n###### Mitigations\n\n  - Configure your intrusion detection systems (IDS), intrusion prevention\n\nsystems (IPS), or any network defense mechanisms in place to alert on —\n\nand upon review, consider blocking illicit connection attempts from — the\n\nexternal IP addresses and domains listed in Appendix A.\n\n  - Ensure system configuration (including access control) for both internally\n\nand externally accessible systems is properly evaluated and that strong\n\npasswords are employed on all systems\n\n  - Practice network segmentation and ensure special protections exist for\n\nsensitive information, such as multi-factor authentication and extremely\n\nrestricted access and storage on systems only accessible via an internal\n\nnetwork.\n\n  - Disable basic and legacy authentication where possible, as these can\n\nallow attackers to bypass in-place security measures.\n\n  - Keep all software and applications up to date — in particular, operating\n\nsystems, antivirus software, and core system utilities.\n\n  - Filter email correspondence and scrutinize attachments for malware.\n\n  - Employ host-based controls; one of the best defenses and warning\n\nsignals to thwart attacks is to conduct client-based host logging and\n\nintrusion detection capabilities.\n\n  - Implement basic incident response and detection deployments and\n\ncontrols like network IDS, netflow collection, host logging, and web proxy,\n\nalongside human monitoring of detection sources.\n\n|File Name|SHA256 Hash|\n|---|---|\n|How Catholics Adapt to Changes in China A Missiological Perspective.zip|ba61ae5b49b12a941e7ef096b­ 4714f6a9dc5e43cb­ 28527749fa8425a75a315f4|\n|How Catholics Adapt to Changes in China A Missiological Perspective.exe|6c959cfb001fbb900958441dfd8b­ 262fb33e052342948bab­ 338775d3e83ef7f7 (legitimate Microsoft Word executable vulnerable to DLL side-loading)|\n|wwlib.dll|a64997b94ebfea461c95d445a4d13a­ a4c4bd49604451208746d95d10 6b677053 (malicious first stage side-loaded DLL)|\n\n|File Name|SHA256 Hash|\n|---|---|\n|Catholic Bishops call for urgent Cameroon peace talks.zip|4847d29dc1269b4da­ f68e59691e2832be­ 3d00aa6bade54330b2d­ 93610c6ff544|\n|Catholic Bishops call for urgent Cameroon peace talks.exe|6c959cfb001fbb900958441dfd8b­ 262fb33e052342948bab­ 338775d3e83ef7f7 (legitimate Microsoft Word executable vulnerable to DLL side-loading)|\n|wwlib.dll|3f1d0a0d31242bd40e6febbd­ d97a9e26cb79dc202bd4f­ 155c0a488a146b07dfa (malicious first stage side-loaded DLL)|\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Outlook\n\nRedDelta’s reuse of publicly reported infrastructure and TTPs highlights a\n\ncontrast in risk appetite across Chinese state-sponsored threat activity groups.\n\nWhereas some groups remain heavily active despite extensive public reporting\n\n(such as [APT41 and RedDelta), others drastically change behaviours or reduce](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/03/apt41-initiates-global-intrusion-campaign-using-multiple-exploits.html)\n\n[activity in response to public reporting, such as APT3.

In previous reporting, we highlighted the group’s targeting\n\nof entities such as religious organizations and non-governmental organizations\n\n(NGOs), which often lack the ability or will to adequately invest in security and\n\ndetection measures.

Where we\n\nhave identified a criminal entity connected to a particular country,\n\nwe will use the appropriate country color, and where that group may\n\nbe tied to a specific government organization, tie it to that entity\n\nspecifically.\n\nInsikt Group uses mathematical terms when naming newly\n\nidentified malware.\n\n\n###### INFRASTRUCTURE CAPABILITY\n\n VICTIM\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Appendix A — Indicators of Compromise\n\n_Figure 6: Maltego chart of newly identified RedDelta infrastructure and malware samples._\n\n\n-----\n\n|File Name|SHA256 Hash|\n|---|---|\n|History of Tibet-Ladakh Relations and Their Modern Implications.zip|ca59ad2becdfba8f308264ec336b07bc415ea34f36d9e84228eda97cd8f7ef5c|\n|wwlib.dll|039bbe3f1d84efe3546f329aa1e4a42426cbe7950f68caed3dfe85cca9b6ebe0|\n|wsc.dll|a1640a83373a8ce9e80734418ee0b10d48d3d0d823883a519849b50710c9f46a|\n|main.dat|c2652596fb983c2b4c9bd3daa97ad992650be070ce4a0d4fbbaba0eb4e43decc|\n|Advance version of the 2020 Report of the Sec­ retary-General on Peacebuilding and Sustaining Peace.zip|4f29180005f3c2e776d1854722270287111ec073ab80dfc1b4dc1bc0d9337ddf|\n|acrord32.dll|eef56bfc68959c6eaa66ab6abcaaf8fb54aa5b5a7da0866d97a1effeae0952b8|\n|wsc.dll|5a795c4b2a1a9c76791a516822ae0c9ec9d02780c41d2f6a6960a4ea15d68e34|\n|main.dat|f7a7eca072cb07af2a769bff4729478a9ec714c59e3c1c25410184014ccee18e|\n|How Catholics Adapt to Changes in China A Missio­ logical Perspective.zip|ba61ae5b49b12a941e7ef096b4714f6a9dc5e43cb28527749fa8425a75a315f4|\n|wwlib.dll|a64997b94ebfea461c95d445a4d13aa4c4bd49604451208746d95d106b677053|\n|wsc.dll|DAEDB4C0BB841423F66A67D169D6831075C4DF98D7823857BE76F280752127C7|\n|main.dat|E74182800EB247A9E0DFB7E6274DEC2839571B650143BCD30423ABE10F8DAAC4|\n|Catholic Bishops call for urgent Cameroon peace talks.zip|4847d29dc1269b4daf68e59691e2832be3d00aa6bade54330b2d93610c6ff544|\n|wwlib.dll|3f1d0a0d31242bd40e6febbdd97a9e26cb79dc202bd4f155c0a488a146b07dfa|\n\n\n-----\n\n###### About Recorded Future\n\nRecorded Future arms security teams with the only complete security intelligence\n\nsolution powered by patented machine learning to lower risk.
