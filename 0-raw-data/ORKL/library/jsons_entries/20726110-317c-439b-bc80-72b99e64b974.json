However, Symantec researchers analyzing two other attacks determined that the\nthe adversary went undetected on the network for as long as 250 days.\n\nUsing custom malware unknown to threat analysts played a key role in achieving this level\nof stealthiness.\n\nxPack is a .NET loader that fetches and executes AES-encrypted payloads, while it's also\ncapable to execute system commands and stage data for exfiltration.\n\nSymantec also spotted the following custom tools that accompanied xPack in this\ncamapaign:\n\n\n-----\n\n**EHAGBPSL – Custom C++ loader**\n**JpgRun – Custom C++ loader**\n**CheckID – Custom C++ loader based on a similar tool used by the BlackHole RAT**\n**NetSessionEnum – Custom SMB session enumeration tool**\n**ENCODE MMC – Custom bind/reverse file transfer tool**\nKerberos golden ticket tool based on the Mimikatz credentials stealer\n\nAntlion also used various off-the-shelf and living-off-the-land (LoL) tools in combination with\nthe above to achieve full operational capability without raising security flags.\n\nTools such as PowerShell, WMIC, ProcDump, LSASS, and PsExec were common in this\ncampaign, leaving crumbs of evidence that easily blend with ordinary operating\nsystem functions.\n\nFinally, the actors were also observed leveraging CVE-2019-1458 for privilege escalation\nand remote scheduling that helped execute the backdoor.\n\n[This vulnerability was recently included on CISA's list of actively exploited flaws, so it's still](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cisa-alerts-federal-agencies-of-ancient-bugs-still-being-exploited/)\nan attractive avenue for multiple adversaries.\n\n\"There is also evidence that the attackers likely automated the data collection process via\nbatch scripts, while there is also evidence of instances where data was likely staged for\nfurther exfiltration, though it was not actually observed being exfiltrated from the network,\"\n[explains Symantec](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/china-apt-antlion-taiwan-financial-attacks)\n\n\"In these instances, it appears the attackers were interested in collecting information from\nsoftware pertaining to business contacts, investments, and smart card readers.\"\n\nIn the attacks dissected by Symantec's analysts, xPack was initially used to collect basic\nsystem information and running processes, and then for dumping credentials.\n\nAfterwards, the actors returned periodically and launched xPack again to steal account\ncredentials from several machines in the compromised organizations.\n\n## Antlion still active and dangerous\n\nAntlion is believed to be involved in cyber-espionage activities since at least 2011, so this is\nan actor that has remained a threat to organizations for over a decade now.\n\nIts interest in targeting Taiwanese firms has political extensions and is in line with the\noperational strategy of most Chinese state-sponsored groups.\n\nAs detailed in Symantec's report, the particular campaign focused on dumping credentials\nfrom the compromised systems and then using them to move laterally.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt s possible that Antlion shared these credentials with other Chinese hacker groups that\nhad a different operational focus, as it is common for actors working for the same state to\ncollaborate.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Hackers target Russian govt with fake Windows updates pushing RATs](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-target-russian-govt-with-fake-windows-updates-pushing-rats/)\n\n[BPFDoor: Stealthy Linux malware bypasses firewalls for remote access](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/bpfdoor-stealthy-linux-malware-bypasses-firewalls-for-remote-access/)\n\n[Chinese ‘Space Pirates’ are hacking Russian aerospace firms](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/chinese-space-pirates-are-hacking-russian-aerospace-firms/)\n\n[Bitter cyberspies target South Asian govts with new malware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/bitter-cyberspies-target-south-asian-govts-with-new-malware/)\n\n[Hackers are now hiding malware in Windows Event Logs](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-are-now-hiding-malware-in-windows-event-logs/)\n\n[Antlion](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/antlion/)\n[APT](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/apt/)\n[Backdoor](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/backdoor/)\n[China](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/china/)\n[Hackers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/hackers/)\n[Taiwan](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/taiwan/)\n\n[Bill Toulas](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/bill-toulas/)\n\nBill Toulas is a technology writer and infosec news reporter with over a decade of\nexperience working on various online publications.
