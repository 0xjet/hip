SATAN,\nNemesis, Petya, RaaSberry, Shark, Data Keeper…the list goes on. However, the trend,\nespecially in the last year, has been for these services to become increasingly exclusive.\n[NEMTY Revenue & Zeppelin are two prime examples of this.](https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/meet-nemty-successor-nefilim-nephilim-ransomware/)\n\nStill, every now and then we stumble across a fully public service. It gets even more\ninteresting when that service offers a “seamless” experience across OS platforms.\nRansomware families with full feature parity across Windows, Linux and macOS do not pop\nup all that often, which brings us to today’s topic: the SMAUG RaaS (Ransomware as a\nService) offering.\n\n## SMAUG’s Differentiators\n\nThe SMAUG RaaS emerged towards the end of April 2020, and seems to have gained some\ntraction in the following months. SMAUG appears to be a robust and full-service RaaS, with\na few tweaks that set it apart from the others.\n\nCriminals who wish to become SMAUG “distributors” will likely be used to the offerings\nassociated with this type of service. The SMAUG operators currently charge a 20% service\nfee. However, there is also a registration fee which is quite steep when compared to other\n\n\n-----\n\nfully-public services. The current registration fee is .2 BTC, around $1800 USD at today s\nprices.\n\nThere are some possible exceptions to getting around the registration fee. On some forums\nwhere SMAUG is advertising, the developers state that free memberships (owing only the\nservice fees) will be given to the first five customers with a certain number of posts, and the\nability to prove their past work (attacks).\n\nPerhaps the most interesting differentiators are multi-platform support (all 64-bit) and the\ninclusion of a “Company Mode”, which allows for a single key to apply to an entire body of\ninfected ‘hosts’ (aka a targeted company). If the victim chooses to comply with the attackers,\nthen a single key can be used to decrypt (theoretically) all the encrypted hosts in that\nenvironment.\n\n\n-----\n\nSMAUG also has offline capabilities, meaning that the payload does not have to have any\namount of connectivity in order to execute and encrypt.\n\nSMAUG is designed to evade traditional AV products. Along with crypting/obfuscation, the\npayloads have been developed to have as minimal a footprint as possible.\n\nIt should be noted that SMAUG does not appear to include a native crypting/packing feature.\nConsequently, the developers advise attackers to further obfuscate their payloads. They note\nthe following within the Campaign configuration options of the SMAUG management\ninterface: “Even though the payload is stealthy it is recommended to use crypting service to\n_ensure the payload is undetectable by antivirus solutions.”_\n\nThe operators advertise a fully automated payment system, as well as highly customizable\ncampaigns. This allows attackers to streamline and organize multiple campaigns within the\nmanagement interface.\n\n\n-----\n\nMost RaaS operators offer a high level of “support” for their affiliates, and this one is no\ndifferent. SMAUG offers full support for both their customers and victims.\n\n## Customizable Malware, But Mind Your Targets\n\nIn SMAUG’s service advertisements, they state “Infecting CIS is forbidden and will result in a\n_ban” In this context, CIS is the ‘Commonwealth of Independent States’ aka the group of_\nindependent countries that were once part of the Soviet Union.\n\nCampaigns created by SMAUG are, as stated, fully customizable, allowing attackers to set\ntheir desired price (BTC), deadline/timing constraints, as well as the actual ransom note’s\nmessage.\n\nSMAUG-generated malware is designed to execute extremely fast. They tout this as follows:\n\n_“The payload utilizes multi-threaded native code which ensures the encryption is done before_\n_your victims can react to it.”_\n\n\n-----\n\nPayloads are generated directly in SMAUG s web-based management interface. While many\nRaaS offerings provide their own offline builder, this can often complicate the process, and\nlead to issues for the aspiring attackers. SMAUG works around this with their “simple web\nUI”. Victims are able to submit a single file for decryption for free. Beyond that, they must\ncomply with the ransom demands as set in the campaign.\n\nIndividual files are encrypted via AES-256. An RSA-2048 public key is used to encrypt the\nAES encryption key.\n\n## Go Payloads\n\nThe SMAUG payloads for Windows are obfuscated Go binaries. With that in mind, these\npayloads begin to bear a resemblance to other similar Ransomware services (ex: Project\nRoot).\n\n\n-----\n\nUpon launch the malware will drop a copy of itself into a local driver directory, such as:\n```\nC:WindowsSysWOW64drivers\nC:WindowsSystem32drivers\n\n```\nThe malware will then attempt to establish persistence via LoadAppInit_DLLs key in the\nregistry. For example,\n\n```\nHKLMSOFTWAREMicrosoftWindows NTCurrentVersionWindowsLoadAppInit_DLLs\n\n```\n\nThe SMAUG payloads contain additional functionality to gather system information and\nstored browser credentials. Encryption is achieved via simple AES-256, again similar to\n[Project Root and other Go-based ransomware services. Upon encryption, affected files will](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/behind-enemy-lines-looking-into-raas-project-root/)\nhave a lengthy extension added (e.g., `11bdd939-1d45-421c-9be0-0addcdc8181c )`\n\n\n-----\n\nA ransom note is deposited in all directories containing encrypted files. In our analyzed\nexample, the dropped ransom note was simply named “HACKED.TXT” with the following\ncontents:\n\n_“Your files have been encrypted using military grade encryption. They can never be_\n_accessed again without buying a decryption key. You can buy the decryption key at_\n_http://[redacted].onion. To access the site you need Tor Browser._\n\nto view site you can download torbrowser here – https://www.torproject.org/download/\nneed help?support [redacted]@secmail.pro”\n\nVictims are instructed, via the ransom note, to visit SMAUG’s onion-based portal for payment\ninstructions and processing.\n\n\n-----\n\nOddly enough, SMAUG appears to have one of the most “helpful” payment (aka extortion)\nportals we have seen. Their walkthroughs (for both victims and affiliates) are very thorough:\n\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusion\n\nProtecting your environment against threats like SMAUG is more critical than ever. In order\nto prevent loss of data and the consequences of a large-scale data breach, organizations\n[must rely on a modern, well maintained, and properly-tuned and trusted security solution.](https://www.sentinelone.com/platform/)\nPrevention is key with these attacks. Even in the event that the encryption/data-loss can be\nmitigated through decryptors, backups or rollbacks, victims still face the problem of their data\nbeing posted publicly. We encourage security teams to analyze and understand the threats\nand to take swift and appropriate action to prevent incidents occurring in the first place.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n**SHA1**\n\n929b10f78565660535a07917d144d00b0c117571\n\n**SHA256**\n\nF2363a355fe226cb2f7f1afa72daecc5edfe1cb0edc1295856fb3f874d941b6d\n\n**MITRE ATT&CK**\n\nData Encrypted for Impact [T1486](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1486/)\n\n[Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder T1547](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/001/)\n\n[Exfiltration Over C2 Channel T1041](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1041/)\n\n[Obfuscated Files or Information T1027](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Credentials from Password Stores T1555](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1555/)\nCredentials from Password Stores: Credentials from Web Browsers [T1555.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1555/003/)\n[Inhibit System Recovery T1490](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1490/)\n\n\n-----",
