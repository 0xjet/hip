Read all articles in the series here.](https://mwi.usma.edu/full-spectrum/)_\n\n_Special thanks to series editors Capt. Maggie Smith, PhD of the Army Cyber Institute and_\n_MWI fellow Dr. Barnett S. Koven._\n\nWhen it comes to America’s focus on great power competition, China and Russia loom large,\nmaking the analysis of these two competitors and their strategies a booming business for\nanalysts and practitioners alike. But while Russia’s “Gerasimov doctrine” (which is not really\na doctrine) and China’s “three warfares” are the focus of many articles, how these two states\nand their militaries act in cyberspace is less often discussed and less well understood.\nInformation operations play a central role to both the Russian and the Chinese ways of war,\nand cyber applications are a central mode by which information is applied as a tool of\n[warfare. China conceives of “informationized warfare,” with the space and cyber domains](https://jamestown.org/program/chinas-new-military-strategy-winning-informationized-local-wars/)\n\n\n-----\n\ndescribed as becoming the commanding heights of strategic competition. Make no mistake:\ndespite claims to the contrary, both China and Russia see themselves currently engaged in\ninformation warfare against the United States. This war is playing out principally in the cyber\nrealm. The military application of information as an instrument of war—in isolation and in\nconjunction with other tools—is a central component of these states’ modern approaches to\nwarfare. As Chief of the Russian General Staff General Valery Gerasimov himself observed,\nspecial operations forces leveraging information operations could be effectively employed to\n[“defend and advance [Russia’s] national interests beyond” its borders. China, for its part, has](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/02/world/europe/russia-hybrid-war-gerasimov.html)\ndeveloped and deployed dedicated information operations units skilled in cyberespionage\nand cyber-enabled information operations. This article serves to highlight some of the\ndifferences between how the United States, China, and Russia view cyberspace, and the\nways Russia and China are using cyberspace operations to engage the United States\nasymmetrically.\n\nOne way in which both Russia and China view cyberspace operations differently than the\nUnited States is through their use of domestic proxies to confront opponents. To the United\nStates, there is a clear bright line separating the employment of the state’s capabilities from\n[those of private US citizens in cyberspace. Both China and Russia have no qualms](https://dk.mors.si/Dokument.php?id=1801&lang=slv)\n[employing commercial companies, “patriotic hackers,” or](https://www.wired.com/story/russia-ira-propaganda-senate-report/) [cybercriminals on behalf of the](https://dk.mors.si/Dokument.php?id=1801&lang=slv)\nstate. Of course, both China and Russia leave just enough space between the state and\nthese proxy groups so that they can claim plausible deniability. Another important way in\nwhich the United States differs from China and Russia is in how it has organized its military\nto confront adversaries in cyberspace. In the United States, the government has divided\ncontrol over cyberspace. While it has created a military command for the cyberspace\ndomain, US Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM), it also rightfully allows information\noperations to intersect with each of the other commands. This means there is no particular\nUS military command in charge of information operations. Rather, all commands share\nresponsibility over this space. Russia and China view cyberspace very differently.\n\n**Russian Cyberspace Operations**\n\nFor Russia, a core tenet of successful information operations is to be at war with the United\nStates, without Americans even knowing it (and the Kremlin can and does persistently deny\n[it). The Kremlin views cyberspace holistically, to include electronic warfare, psychological](https://www.cna.org/cna_files/pdf/DOP-2016-U-014231-1Rev.pdf)\noperations, and information operations (including information warfare, or informatsionnaya\n_voina)._ [In Russia, the government has taken a much different view of cyberspace than the](https://fas.org/irp/world/russia/CBP-8430.pdf)\nUS government has, particularly the linking of cyberspace operations to special operations.\nThe Russian Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) of the General Staff has primacy in\nexternal cyberspace operations, to include espionage, information warfare, and offensive\ncyberspace operations. This comprehensive approach creates interesting synergies for the\nRussian military. In addition to the GRU, the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) has a\ndomestic operations division with an internal security and counterintelligence (CI) mission.\nThe FSB (the old KGB) also undertakes external cyberspace operations stemming from its\n\n\n-----\n\nCI responsibilities. As such, its external operations sometimes conflict with the GRU s\n[cyberspace operations due to poor coordination (indeed, poor coordination plagues Russian](https://www.rand.org/pubs/external_publications/EP68400.html)\nspecial operations in general). For example, both the GRU and FSB unknowingly targeted\nthe [Democratic National Committee at the same time for a hack-and-dump operation. The](https://www.cyberscoop.com/russia-obama-sanctions-dnc-hacks-gru-fsb/)\nfinal major Russian agency involved in cyberspace operations is the Foreign Intelligence\nService (SVR), which conducts espionage on behalf of the Russian state, and has become\n[quite adept at cyberespionage as recently evinced in the SolarWinds hack.](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF11718)\n\n[Unlike the United States, Russia is not known to have a definitive cyberspace strategy, policy](https://www.rand.org/pubs/external_publications/EP68319.html)\ndirective, or doctrine. Therefore, what researchers understand about Russian operations and\nactivities in cyberspace is derived from the writings of Russian military scholars and official\ndocuments, and even teaching materials at the nation’s various military academies. From\nthese sources, it is apparent that the Russian government views cyberspace primarily in\nterms of [“information confrontation” and the technical infrastructure used to control](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR2200/RR2237/RAND_RR2237.pdf)\n[information. To shape and control information, the Russian military takes a hybrid approach,](https://boozallen.com/content/dam/boozallen_site/ccg/pdf/publications/bearing-witness-uncovering-the-logic-behind-russian-military-cyber-operations-2020.pdf)\nintegrating “special operations forces and non-kinetic political, economic, or informational\nmeasures.” Therefore, cyber is a central component of the Kremlin’s hybrid warfare model, or\n[what Russia refers to as “asymmetric methods.”](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23296151.2016.1134964)\n\nRussian information operations are among the best in the world and Russia is not afraid to\nuse them. Indeed, Russia believes that the tools of information warfare must be brought to\n[bear early and often. To Russia, there is no distinction between information operations, to](https://www.cna.org/cna_files/pdf/DOP-2016-U-014231-1Rev.pdf)\ninclude those occurring in cyberspace, during times of war or peace. That said, by employing\ninformation operations before the start of a kinetic conflict, Russia may be able to achieve\ntheir desired strategic aims without having to resort to kinetic military operations. Even where\nit is still necessary to use kinetic force, information operations are nevertheless synergistic\nwith the application of military force, by, for example, degrading the resolve of the opposing\nmilitary force.\n\nControl of information has been critical throughout Russia’s authoritarian past, during tsarist\ntimes, continuing during the history of the Soviet Union, and now under the current\nkleptocratic regime. All of these authoritarian governments came to realize that when they\ncontrol information they can also shape the course of events within the country. Conversely,\nwhen they lose control of information, such as during the glasnost period, the government\ncannot control the narrative and may lose legitimacy among the population. Therefore, since\nRussia understands how susceptible it is to losing control over its own information space, it\nhas also come to realize how vulnerable other countries are in this space, especially those\ncountries that have deep societal cleavages. While Russia has become very proficient at\n[disinformation campaigns to exploit societal cleavages, it is most adept when it can amplify](https://books.google.com/books/about/Active_Measures.html?id=lWltDwAAQBAJ&source=kp_book_description)\nor augment existing homegrown narratives. For example, Russia has long sought to\nexacerbate racial tensions in the United States. Russia was also implicated in a\n[disinformation campaign to discredit the World Anti-Doping Agency as a “whole-of-society”](https://secondaryinfektion.org/download)\napproach (the operations include actors beyond the government) to highlight Western moral\n\n\n-----\n\nhypocrisy. More recently, Russian information operations headed by either the GRU or the\n[FSB have targeted left-leaning organizations, like Peace Data, and right-leaning platforms,](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-facebook-russia/duped-by-russia-freelancers-ensnared-in-disinformation-campaign-by-promise-of-easy-money-idUSKBN25T35E)\n[like Parler, to exacerbate existing tensions in the United States.](https://public-assets.graphika.com/reports/graphika_report_step_into_my_parler.pdf)\n\nCyberspace has become one area in which Russia has capitalized on the asymmetric power\nof operations and activities within the information space. As alluded to previously, the United\nStates and Russia understand the domain and how to employ effects in and through\ncyberspace very differently. As such, the United States and Russia are fundamentally at\n[odds over any sort of cyberspace rules of the road. This has particular significance in three](https://www.csis.org/analysis/responding-russia-deterring-russian-cyber-and-grey-zone-activities)\nareas: espionage, information warfare, and offensive cyberspace operations.\n\nRussian cyberspace espionage is conducted to gather not only intelligence relating to\nnational security, but also economic intelligence. Most recently, Russia was suspected of\n[attempting to hack into pharmaceutical companies in search of COVID-19 research data.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-microsoft-coronavirus-cyber/north-korean-russian-hackers-target-covid-19-researchers-microsoft-idUSKBN27T1WF)\n[This hacking activity is an unsurprising development. As stated by Gen. Gerasimov, Russia](https://www.armyupress.army.mil/Portals/7/military-review/Archives/English/MilitaryReview_20160228_art009.pdf)\nmust leverage all elements of national power, and this includes cyberespionage (and cyber[enabled economic warfare) to shape the information space and degrade an adversary’s](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/IF11625.pdf)\ncapabilities. One of the more infamous acts of Russian cyberespionage involved a cutout\n[group called the Shadow Brokers, which likely leveraged the work of the Russian](https://www.wired.com/story/eternalblue-leaked-nsa-spy-tool-hacked-world/)\ncybersecurity firm Kaspersky to locate NSA-developed malware. This malware was possibly\nfound among classified materials that a contractor brought home and operated on his\npersonally owned computer. The [EternalBlue exploits employed by Shadow Brokers](https://www.avast.com/c-eternalblue)\nsubsequently wreaked havoc across the world.\n\nWhen it comes to offensive cyberspace operations, or what the US military describes as\ndeny, degrade, disrupt, destroy, and manipulate (D4M) operations, the GRU is the primary\nactor. The GRU’s dominance makes sense given that the SVR and FSB are more focused\non espionage. However, since the GRU is a military organization first and not primarily\nconcerned with stealth, its offensive cyberspace operations are known for being blunt and\n[reckless, as seen in the NotPetya attack, the Saudi](https://www.wired.com/story/notpetya-cyberattack-ukraine-russia-code-crashed-the-world/) [petrochemical attack, or the attacks](https://www.wired.com/story/russia-sanctions-triton-malware/)\nagainst Ukraine’s [power grid. These types of aggressive cyber actions that cause real-world](https://books.google.com/books/about/Sandworm.html?id=ujxrDwAAQBAJ&source=kp_book_description)\neffects will allow Russia to be a formidable force when combined with its traditional strengths\nin information operations and the insights gleaned through cyberespionage.\n\n**Chinese Cyberspace Operations**\n\n[Much like Russia, China also sees information operations as central to its conception of](https://www.iiss.org/publications/strategic-dossiers/asiapacific-regional-security-assessment-2019/rsa19-07-chapter-5)\ncompetition in cyberspace. In fact, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)—and by extension\nits defender, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA)—views information operations via space,\n[cyber, and electronic warfare as the “tip of the spear” in any future conflict to shape the](https://cyberdefensereview.army.mil/Portals/6/Documents/CDR%20Journal%20Articles/The%20Strategic%20Support%20Force_Kania_Costello.pdf)\nnarrative and obtain information superiority, thereby paralyzing a more powerful enemy.\n\n\n-----\n\nChina further expanded upon its comprehension of cyberspace with the creation of the\n[Strategic Support Force (SSF) in 2015. Some analysts view the SSF as an enhanced](https://cyberdefensereview.army.mil/Portals/6/Documents/CDR%20Journal%20Articles/The%20Strategic%20Support%20Force_Kania_Costello.pdf)\nChinese counterpart to USCYBERCOM. The SSF not only focuses on the traditional D4M\noperations of USCYBERCOM, but has also added space, electronic, and psychological\nwarfare. Housing these different but complementary cyber-enabled capabilities within the\n[same command is expected to create synergies that these capabilities cannot achieve on](https://asianmilitaryreview.com/2020/01/china-broadens-cyber-options/)\ntheir own. Moreover, having a suite of functions under the same command during peacetime\n[will give the CCP and PLA the ability to seamlessly transition to an integrated campaign](https://cyberdefensereview.army.mil/Portals/6/Documents/CDR%20Journal%20Articles/The%20Strategic%20Support%20Force_Kania_Costello.pdf)\nduring wartime.\n\nWhile China has not openly published a cyberspace strategy, scholars and practitioners are\nin widespread agreement as to the CCP’s aims. It seeks to control the flow of information to\n[and within China to ensure domestic stability (and halt the efforts of “splittists” who seek the](https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/files.cnas.org/documents/CNAS_WarringState_Chang_report_010615.pdf?mtime=20160906082142&focal=none)\n[disintegration of the PRC), and preserve economic growth through commercial espionage.](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2018-08-13/when-china-rules-web)\nBy controlling dissent and driving economic growth, the CCP ensures that it is able to\nmaintain power.\n\nChina asserts that just as every state is the sovereign within its own borders, each should\n[likewise be the sovereign within its own cyberspace.

Due to the extensive cyberspace dragnet that\n[the CCP has put in place, the government is aware of the activities of these hackers and can](https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/files.cnas.org/documents/CNAS_WarringState_Chang_report_010615.pdf?mtime=20160906082142&focal=none)\n[stop them when it so desires. However, the CCP has also employed this hacker network as](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5765925)\nan extension of the state while at the same time retaining plausible deniability since these\npatriotic hackers are not formally part of the state apparatus.\n\nThe CCP’s firm hold on power is a function of both its ability to maintain economic growth\nand its control over the flow of information in China. This explains why both economic\n[cyberspace espionage and information operations have seen increased investment by the](https://fcw.com/articles/2019/05/06/china-information-warfare-dod-report.aspx)\nChinese military in recent years. Moreover, the CCP has leveraged China’s commercial\n\n\n-----\n\n[sector to support the state s interests, as seen with the Made in China 2025 plan that](https://fcw.com/articles/2019/05/06/china-information-warfare-dod-report.aspx)\nencourages Chinese companies to create dual-use technologies, which can also be\nemployed by the military. This coupling of the state and private enterprise is seen in China’s\nCyber Security Law and National Intelligence Law, the latter of which [necessitates that “any](https://www.aspistrategist.org.au/huawei-and-the-ambiguity-of-chinas-intelligence-and-counter-espionage-laws/)\norganization and citizen shall, in accordance with the law, support, provide assistance, and\ncooperate in national intelligence work, and guard the secrecy of any national intelligence\nwork that they are aware of.”\n\nThe Chinese state does not employ externally focused information operations nearly as\neffectively as their Russian counterparts. However, the Chinese state is constantly learning,\n[and likely gleaned a lot from Russia’s successful 2016 influence operations in the US](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2020/05/19/the-kremlins-disinformation-playbook-goes-to-beijing/)\npolitical space. Traditionally, the Chinese state focused the majority of its information\noperations internally in order to maintain stability. However, with the rise of Xi Jinping, China\n[has shifted some of their information operations from primarily being for domestic control to](https://fsi-live.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/sio-china_story_white_paper-final.pdf)\ninfluencing the external environment. This is most evident in China’s projection of a\n[newfound muscular international image, and in its defensiveness over COVID-19. All that](https://www.brookings.edu/techstream/how-chinas-wolf-warrior-diplomats-use-and-abuse-twitter/)\n[said, Chinese large-scale, external influence operations still need further refinement.](https://public-assets.graphika.com/reports/graphika_report_spamouflage.pdf)\n\n**Looking Ahead**\n\nIn short, Russia and China view information and cyberspace operations differently than the\nUnited States does, and they are designing their operations and cyberinfrastructure to\nengage the United States asymmetrically. As previously noted and despite persistent claims\nto the contrary, both states see themselves currently engaged in information warfare against\nthe United States. The military application of information as an instrument of war—in\nisolation and in conjunction with other tools—is a central component of these states’ modern\napproach to warfare, both today and into the foreseeable future.
