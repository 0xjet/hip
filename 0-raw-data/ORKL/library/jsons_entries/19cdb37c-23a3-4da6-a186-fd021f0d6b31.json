Generally, home routers\n**Internet of Things (IoT) devices, how it has changed the typical** are often used by cyber criminals to perform acts such as\n**perception of malware having a malicious nature, and what has** Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.

This is due to the fact that it serves\n\nI. INTRODUCTION one purpose – to protect the devices that it infects. By\n\nAccording to Fisher (2018), the composition of the word identifying weak, or unchanged passwords through hacking\n“malware” originates from the combination of “malicious”, and Telnet, and other protocols. It would then disable Telnet after\n“software”. It is used to depict the nature of software that is scanning for known malwares in the device to avoid further\ncreated with ill intentions such as intrusion of permission on a infections. Although there is potential in misusing the\ncomputer to steal personal information through the usage of a backdoor created by Wifatch, it was never put into use for\nbackdoor. Software that behaves in such a way that it wasn’t anything of sorts – which leads to experts believing that it was\nintended to could also be classified as a malware [1]. They part of the “IoT vigilantes” effort in securing devices that were\nexist in forms such as rootkits, spyware, Trojans, adwares, at risk [7].\nviruses, and worms – all of which are used to complete tasks\nsuch as stealing data that are protected, deleting, or even\nadding software without the user’s approval, or III. IMPACT ON IOT\nacknowledgement [2].\n\nIt has been reported that there were speculations whereby\n\nIn a modernized world, the need for a globalized devices, Wifatch was created in attempts to fend against surveillance by\nand network of machines that are capable of interacting with governmental agencies – for instance, National Security\none another is the basis of Internet of Things – which is also Agency (NSA). A comment left in the piece of code quoted\nknown as Internet of Everything. In simpler terms, IoT is from Richard Stallman in this malware hints on defending\ndefined as devices that are linked to the Internet, and are constitutional rights of the people. Knowing the nature of how\nequipped with sensors, and actuators [3] [4]. home routers could be used as a medium to spread updates\n\nwithout acknowledgement from the user – this malware will\n\nBy infiltrating a vulnerable Telnet authentication, Wifatch\n\nurge the device’s owner to make use of stronger passwords,\n\nuses a backdoor through routers at home to communicate with\n\naside from updating the current firmware as such ignorance\n\na Command & Control (C&C) server. What makes it unique is\n\ncould lead to future mishaps. In order to “prevent” certain\n\nthat although it is classified as a malware, it acts a guard\n\ndevices such as the CCTV (of which Wifatch is unable to\n\nagainst other forms of infection without any malicious intent to\n\n“protect” against other malwares), it was designed to reboot the\n\nits host – hence, it is categorized as a white – hat Trojan [5].\n\nsystem after a certain period of time - taking advantage of the\nfact that malwares in embedded systems are not as persistent,\nand that a reinstallation must take place for them to take effect.\n\nII. THE DISCOVERY Although it is concerning, the researchers have found that the\n\nIn 2014, an unusual activity was detected on a home router commands that were passed through the backdoor were\nby an independent security researcher in which the process cryptographically signed. In other words, this indicates that\nwas not part of the original device’s software. Upon further only the original author would be able to control what it does.\ninvestigation, an intricate, and sophisticated code - designed in In turn, this cuts the chances of the said malware of being\nPerl - was discovered that had caused the router to manipulated by malicious hijackers. Interestingly enough, the\ninvoluntarily connect to other infected network of peer – to – Internet is claimed to be at a safer state – all thanks to Wifatch\npeer devices. This was further investigated by Symantec by [8][9].\n\n\n-----\n\nIV. THE GOOD AND THE BAD\n\nKnown for its “good” intentions”, Symantec’s Mario\nBallano made a point that it could be manipulated to inflict\ndetrimental damage at any given time through its general –\npurpose back doors. It is still regarded as a malware since it\ninfects the device without the user’s consent. Relying on a\nmalware to “guard” one’s system would not exactly be a wise\nchoice, and thus it is still placed under careful watch [10].\n\nThe positives gained from Wifatch’s release:\n\n  - For educational purposes, and to encourage learning.\n\nThis is supported by the fact that the Perl code was not\nobscure, and that the creator was not concerned of\nhaving it being inspected, nor shared. The source code\nwas only compressed, and minified. Released version of\nit did not contain the private key, selected parts of the\nC&C, and infection code to prevent misuse [7].\n\n  - To promote better understanding in the need to heighten\n\nsecurity measures.\n\nIf in the wrong hands, the botnets are able to carry out\nDDoS attacks through the infected routers. Hence, it\nraises the issue in the importance of addressing default\nsecurity configurations before it is taken advantage of.\n\n  - Increasing security in general.\n\n  - Counteracting against illegal mining of Bitcoin.\n\n  - Saving bandwidth by cancelling out other malware\n\nscans.\n\n  - Reduces interruption of service, reboots, and overheat\n\nof device.\n\n  - Saving credentials from being stolen.\n\nIt is noted that the creation, and spread of the malware is\noriginally caused by the neglect of the user themselves:\n\n  - Leaving default security configurations, and passwords.\n\n  - Lack of concern, and awareness among users.\n\n  - Poor habit, and encouragement by Internet Service\n\nProviders (ISP) to retain original credentials for easier\nmaintenance.\n\n  - Insecure Telnet protocol.\n\nV. BACKGROUND\n\nInspired by Carna botnet, the idea of Wifatch was to\nchallenge the idea of not being able to create something of\nsimilar sorts whereby it challenges the existing security level\nof embedded devices. It is considered to be “virtually\nnonexistent”, and thus giving rise for the need to “protect”\nthese vulnerable users. As Carna botnet before it, it was\ncrucial to act against the vulnerability that existed.\n\n\nWith over a year spent on ways to reliably shut down the\nTelnet’s port, implementing malware detection, and functions\nfor disinfecting the system, on top of the technicalities within\nbootstrapping a botnet – everything within Wifatch’s\nfunctionalities was a challenge.\n\nWifatch was never meant to be kept a secret, and upon\nagreement of free licensing under General Public License – it\nwas made public. The creator firmly stated that although the\ncreated malware holds no ill intentions – users should not use\nthis as a form of comfort, and safety. The known issues, and\nsecurity holes must be dealt immediately. It does not utilize\n0day exploits, nor elaborate backdoors to infiltrate a system,\nand its target only comprises of unprotected devices.\n\nUsers are open to experiment with the codes available on\nalmost an x86 or AMD64 Linux Kernel by loading them on\nthe same directory with a stable network access in order to\nconnect to the P2P network with the option of obtaining the\nextension modules, and upgrading the bot. It will create a\ndatabase directory upon finding a suitable mountpoint. Users\nmust keep in mind that there is no warranty for self\nexperimentation. Not only that, users are encouraged to\nvolunteer to help as more reliable machines are needed in\norder to serve as a backend database for malware signatures.\nGenerally, this botnet requires a full network access to enable\nit to scan vulnerable devices. It is reachable via UDP, and TCP\nwith the range 32769 – 65534. Infections are carried out from\na centralized point, and only a single keypress is needed if\nanything goes sour.\n\nWhen asked if the same creator was behind Carna botnet,\nit was declined. Inspiration was derived from the collected\ndata of the said botnet. The team remains anonymous, though\ngoes by the name “The White Team”.\n\nVI. INFECTION STATISTICS\n\nFigure 1: Infected Architecture Breakdown [6]\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2: Infected Countries Breakdown [6]\n\nFigure 1 depicts the three major architectures that were\nfound to be infected with this malware. ARM architecture is\nmost prevalent as it is the most used firmware partnered with\ncomplimenting cores known to be used by multiple successful\ncompanies such as Apple, Nvidia, Qualcomm, and even\nSamsung Electronics. This is makes up the majority of mobile\ndevices, and embedded systems. MiPS is known to be used in\ngaming consoles, supercomputers, and even in automobiles.\nCertain embedded systems utilize SH4 in cellular phones, LCD\nTVs, and NAS. Whilst not included in the chart – it is reported\nthat X86, and PowerPC holds a miniscule percentage of 0.132\nof total infection percentage [6].\n\nBased on figure 2, the countries affected are listed down\naccordingly. However, it is to be noted that the percentage\nbreakdown may not be as depicted as the malware is removed\nupon resetting the said infected device. It may also become\ninfected after time if the router’s firmware is not up to date, or\nis still using its default password [6].\n\nVII. CONCLUSION\n\nWhile the creation is meant for good use, the users should\nnever grow too comfortable in relying on a white – hat\nmalware to take care of a security issue when it could have\nbeen issued with as simple as changing the default credentials\nof a router. As quoted by Harrington (n.d.), “Violating systems\nas a path to remediation is not the right way to go” [11].\n\nThere could never be a general consensus on whether or\nnot this malware holds more potential in harming, or\nprotecting one’s device. The debate lies in the nature of how\n\n\nsecure the device is to begin with. A protected hardware\nwould not have contracted the malware in the first place. An\ninvasion of privacy is still what it is even if it is doing no\nharm. In the end, there is little that could be done if not for the\nmindset of the users themselves to initiate the change.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n[1] Fisher, T. (n.d.). What Is Malware?
