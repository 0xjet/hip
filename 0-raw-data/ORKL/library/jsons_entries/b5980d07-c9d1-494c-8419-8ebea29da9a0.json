This attack\n[campaign used a new information stealer, detected by Symantec as Trojan.Laziok. Laziok](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2015-021115-3757-99)\nacts as a reconnaissance tool allowing the attackers to gather data about the compromised\ncomputers.\n\nThe detailed information enables the attacker to make crucial decisions about how to\nproceed further with the attack, or to halt the attack. During the course of our research, we\nfound that the majority of the targets were linked to the petroleum, gas and helium\nindustries, suggesting that whoever is behind these attacks may have a strategic interest in\nthe affairs of the companies affected.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1. Regions targeted by Trojan.Laziok_\n\n**How it begins**\nThe initial infection vector involves the use of spam emails coming from the moneytrans[.]eu\ndomain, which acts as an open relay Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) server. These\nemails include a malicious attachment packed with an exploit for the Microsoft Windows\nCommon Controls ActiveX Control Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2012-0158).\nThis vulnerability has been exploited in many different attack campaigns in the past, such\nas [Red October. Symantec and Norton products had protection in place against these](https://community.broadcom.com/symantecenterprise/viewdocument?DocumentKey=be39a836-d60e-40df-a975-4cdfa2a9a716&CommunityKey=1ecf5f55-9545-44d6-b0f4-4e4a7f5f5e68&tab=librarydocuments)\n[exploits at the time of the targeted attack as Bloodhound.Exploit.457 and](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2012-070622-4148-99) Web Attack:\nMicrosoft Common Controls CVE-2012-0158.\n\nIf the user opens the email attachment, which is typically an Excel file, then the exploit code\nis executed. If the exploit succeeds, it drops Trojan.Laziok, kicking off the infection process.\n\n**Infection**\nThe Trojan hides itself in the %SystemDrive%\\Documents and Settings\\All\nUsers\\Application Data\\System\\Oracle directory, making new folders and renaming itself\nwith well-known file names such as:\n\n\n-----\n\n%SystemDrive%\\Documents and Settings\\All Users\\Application\nData\\System\\Oracle\\azioklmpx\\search.exe\n%SystemDrive%\\Documents and Settings\\All Users\\Application\nData\\System\\Oracle\\azioklmpx\\ati.exe\n%SystemDrive%\\Documents and Settings\\All Users\\Application\nData\\System\\Oracle\\azioklmpx\\lsass.exe\n%SystemDrive%\\Documents and Settings\\All Users\\Application\nData\\System\\Oracle\\azioklmpx\\smss.exe\n%SystemDrive%\\Documents and Settings\\All Users\\Application\nData\\System\\Oracle\\azioklmpx\\admin.exe\n%SystemDrive%\\Documents and Settings\\All Users\\Application\nData\\System\\Oracle\\azioklmpx\\key.exe\n%SystemDrive%\\Documents and Settings\\All Users\\Application\nData\\System\\Oracle\\azioklmpx\\taskmgr.exe\n%SystemDrive%\\Documents and Settings\\All Users\\Application\nData\\System\\Oracle\\azioklmpx\\chrome.exe\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2. Overview of the Trojan.Laziok attack_\n\n\n-----\n\nTrojan.Laziok then begins its reconnaissance process by collecting system configuration\ndata such as:\n\nComputer name\nInstalled software\nRAM size\nHard disk size\nGPU details\nCPU details\nAntivirus software\n\nThe collected information is then sent to the attackers. Once the attackers received the\nsystem configuration data, including details of any installed antivirus software, they then\ninfect the computer with additional malware. In this campaign, the attackers distributed\n[customized copies of Backdoor.Cyberat and](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2013-092512-2827-99) [Trojan.Zbot which are specifically tailored for](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2010-011016-3514-99)\nthe compromised computer’s profile. We observed that the threats were downloaded from a\nfew servers operating in the US, UK, and Bulgaria.\n\nThe group behind the attack does not seem to be particularly advanced, as they exploited\nan old vulnerability and used their attack to distribute well-known threats that are available\nin the underground market. However, many people still fail to apply patches for\nvulnerabilities that are several years old, leaving themselves open to attacks of this kind.\nFrom the attacker’s perspective, they don’t always need to have the latest tools at their\ndisposal to succeed. All they need is a bit of help from the user and a lapse in security\noperations through the failure to patch.\n\n**Protection and prevention**\nSymantec and Norton products have the following protections against this campaign:\n\n**Antivirus**\n\n**Intrusion prevention system**\n\n**Gateway protection**\n\nTrojan.Mdropper\nOur antispam technology detects the emails through generic Brightmail Rules.\n\n**Best practices**\nUsers should also adhere to the following best practices to avoid malware infections\nthrough spam campaigns:\n\nAvoid clicking on links in unsolicited, unexpected, or suspicious emails.\nAvoid opening attachments in unsolicited, unexpected, or suspicious emails.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Use comprehensive security software, such as Symantec Endpoint Protection or](http://www.symantec.com/endpoint-protection/)\n[Norton Security, to protect yourself from attacks of this kind.](http://us.norton.com/)\nTake a security layered approach for better protection.\nKeep your security software up to date.\nApply patches for installed software on a timely basis.\n\n\n-----",
