At the time of the attacks\nand our engagement by the Albanian government, Microsoft publicly stated that “Microsoft is committed to helping our\ncustomers be secure while achieving more. During this event, we quickly mobilized our Detection and Response Team\n(DART) to help the Albanian government rapidly recover from this cyber-attack. Microsoft will continue to partner with Albania\nto manage cybersecurity risks while continuing to enhance protections from malicious attackers.” This blog showcases the\ninvestigation, Microsoft’s process in attributing the related actors and the observed tactics and techniques observed by DART\nand the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) to help customers and the security ecosystem defend from similar\nattacks in the future.\n\nMicrosoft assessed with high confidence that on July 15, 2022, actors sponsored by the Iranian government conducted a\ndestructive cyberattack against the Albanian government, disrupting government websites and public services. At the same\ntime, and in addition to the destructive cyberattack, MSTIC assesses that a separate Iranian state-sponsored actor leaked\nsensitive information that had been exfiltrated months earlier. Various websites and social media outlets were used to leak this\ninformation.\n\n\n-----\n\nThere were multiple stages identified in this campaign:\n\nInitial intrusion\nData exfiltration\nData encryption and destruction\nInformation operations\n\nMicrosoft assessed with high confidence that multiple Iranian actors participated in this attack—with different actors\nresponsible for distinct phases:\n\nDEV-0842 deployed the ransomware and wiper malware\nDEV-0861 gained initial access and exfiltrated data\nDEV-0166 exfiltrated data\nDEV-0133 probed victim infrastructure\n\nMicrosoft uses DEV-#### designations as a temporary name given to an unknown, emerging, or a developing cluster of threat\nactivity, allowing MSTIC to track it as a unique set of information until we reach a high confidence about the origin or identity of\nthe actor behind the activity. Once it meets the criteria, the DEV reference is converted to a named actor:\n\nMicrosoft assessed with moderate confidence that the actors involved in gaining initial access and exfiltrating data in the\nattack are linked to EUROPIUM, which has been publicly linked to Iran’s Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS) and was\ndetected using three unique clusters of activity. We track them separately based on unique sets of tools and/or TTPs;\nhowever, some of them may work for the same unit.\n\nInformation specific to Albania is shared with permission from the Albanian government.\n\nFigure 1. Threat actors behind the attack against the Albanian government\n\n## Forensic analysis\n\nEvidence gathered during the forensic response indicated that Iran-affiliated actors conducted the attack. This evidence\nincludes, but is not limited to:\n\nThe attackers were observed operating out of Iran\nThe attackers responsible for the intrusion and exfiltration of data used tools previously used by other known Iranian\nattackers\nThe attackers responsible for the intrusion and exfiltration of data targeted other sectors and countries that are\nconsistent with Iranian interests\nThe wiper code was previously used by a known Iranian actor\nThe ransomware was signed by the same digital certificate used to sign other tools used by Iranian actors\n\n### Intrusion and exfiltration\n\n\n-----\n\nA group that we assess is affiliated with the Iranian government, DEV 0861, likely gained access to the network of an Albanian\ngovernment victim in May 2021 by exploiting the CVE-2019-0604 vulnerability on an unpatched SharePoint Server,\nadministrata.al (Collab-Web2.*.*), and fortified access by July 2021 using a misconfigured service account that was a member\nof the local administrative group. Analysis of Exchange logs suggests that DEV-0861 later exfiltrated mail from the victim’s\nnetwork between October 2021 and January 2022.\n\nDEV-0861 was observed operating from the following IPs to exfiltrate mail:\n\n144[.]76[.]6[.]34\n176[.]9[.]18[.]143\n148[.]251[.]232[.]252\n\nAnalysis of the signals from these IPs, and other sources, indicated that DEV-0861 has been actively exfiltrating mail from\ndifferent organizations in the following countries since April 2020:\n\nFigure 2. Timeline of data exfiltration activities by DEV-0861\nThe geographic profile of these victims—Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and the UAE—aligns with Iranian\ninterests and have historically been targeted by Iranian state actors, particularly MOIS-linked actors.\n\nDEV-0166 was observed exfiltrating mail from the victim between November 2021 and May 2022. DEV-0166 likely used the\n[tool Jason.exe to access compromised mailboxes. A public analysis of Jason.exe can be found here. Note that this tool was](https://marcoramilli.com/2019/06/06/apt34-jason-project/)\nreportedly used by actors affiliated with MOIS.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3.\n\nScreenshot of the Jason.exe tool\n\n### Ransomware and wiper\n\nThe cyberattack on the Albanian government used a common tactic of Iranian state sponsored actors by deploying\nransomware first, followed by deployment of the wiper malware. The wiper and ransomware both had forensic links to Iranian\nstate and Iran-affiliated groups. The wiper that DEV-0842 deployed in this attack used the same license key and EldoS\nRawDisk driver as ZeroCleare, a wiper that Iranian state actors used in an attack on a Middle East energy company in mid2019. In that case, [IBM X-Force assessed that actors affiliated with EUROPIUM gained initial access nearly a year ahead of](https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/OAJ4VZNJ)\nthe wiper attack. The wiper attack was subsequently performed by a separate and unknown Iranian actor. This is similar to the\nchain of events Microsoft detected against the Albanian government.\n\nThe code used in this attack had the following properties:\n\n**Filename** **SHA-256**\n\ncl.exe e1204ebbd8f15dbf5f2e41dddc5337e3182fc4daf75b05acc948b8b965480ca0\n\nrwdsk.sys 3c9dc8ada56adf9cebfc501a2d3946680dcb0534a137e2e27a7fcb5994cd9de6\n\n\n-----\n\nEmbedded in the cl.exe wiper was the hex string\n‘B4B615C28CCD059CF8ED1ABF1C71FE03C0354522990AF63ADF3C911E2287A4B906D47D,’ which was the same license\nkey used for the EldoS RawDisk driver of the ZeroCleare wiper documented by IBM X-Force in 2019. The Eldos driver is a\nlegitimate tool that was also abused by the ZeroCleare wiper and was used to delete files, disks, and partitions on the target\nsystems. While ZeroCleare is not widely used, this tool is being shared amongst a smaller number of affiliated actors including\nactors in Iran with links to MOIS.\n\nThe ransomware payload used in this attack by the DEV-0842 operator had the following properties:\n\n**Filename** **SHA-256**\n\nGoXml.exe f116acc6508843f59e59fb5a8d643370dce82f492a217764521f46a856cc4cb5\n\nThis tool was signed with an invalid digital certificate from Kuwait Telecommunications Company KSC. This certificate had a\nSHA-1 thumbprint of 55d90ec44b97b64b6dd4e3aee4d1585d6b14b26f.\n\nMicrosoft telemetry indicates this certificate was only used to sign 15 other files—a very small footprint, suggesting the\ncertificate was not widely shared amongst unrelated actor groups. Multiple other binaries with this same digital certificate were\npreviously seen on files with links to Iran, including a known DEV-0861 victim in Saudi Arabia in June 2021:\n\n**Filename** **SHA-256**\n\nRead.exe ea7316bbb65d3ba4efc7f6b488e35db26d3107c917b665dc7a81e327470cb0c1\n\nIt’s not clear if Read.exe was dropped by DEV-0861 on this Saudi victim or if DEV-0861 also handed off access to the Saudi\nvictim to DEV-0842.\n\n## Additional indications of Iranian state sponsorship\n\nThe messaging, timing, and target selection of the cyberattacks bolstered our confidence that the attackers were acting on\nbehalf of the Iranian government. The messaging and target selection indicate Tehran likely used the attacks as retaliation for\n[cyberattacks Iran perceives were carried out by Israel and the Mujahedin-e Khalq (MEK), an Iranian dissident group largely](https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/article-708830)\nbased in Albania that seeks to overthrow the Islamic Republic of Iran.\n\n### Messaging\n\nThe attacker’s logo is an eagle preying on the symbol of the hacking group ‘Predatory Sparrow’ inside the Star of David\n(Figure 4). This signals the attack on Albania was retaliation for Predatory Sparrow’s [operations against Iran, which Tehran](https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/article-708830)\n[perceives involved Israel. Predatory Sparrow has claimed responsibility for several high-profile and](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/11/cyber-attack-hits-irans-transport-ministry-and-railways) [highly sophisticated](https://apnews.com/article/technology-middle-east-iran-dubai-b0404963ae23e5008439a0b607952de1)\n[cyberattacks against Iran state-linked entities since July 2021. This included a cyberattack that disrupted television](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/irans-state-broadcaster-says-it-was-hacked-10-seconds-2022-01-27/)\nprogramming of the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB) with images saluting MEK leaders in late January. Predatory\nSparrow forewarned about the attack hours ahead of time and claimed they supported and paid for it, indicating others were\ninvolved. Iranian officials blamed this cyberattack on the MEK and additionally blamed the MEK and Israel for a cyberattack\n[that used the same images and messaging against the Tehran municipality in June.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-27/iran-state-tv-says-exiled-dissidents-briefly-hacked-broadcasts)\n\nThe message in the ransom image indicates that the MEK, a long-standing adversary of the Iranian regime, was the primary\ntarget behind their attack on the Albanian government. The ransom image, like several posts by Homeland Justice, the group\novertly pushing messages and leaking data linked to the attack, asked “why should our taxes be spent on terrorists of Durres.”\n[This is a reference to the MEK, who Tehran considers terrorists, who have a large refugee camp in Durrës County in Albania.](https://en.mfa.ir/files/mfaen/s.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4. Ransomware image and Homeland Justice banner\nThe messaging linked to the attack closely mirrored the messaging used in cyberattacks against Iran, a common tactic of\nIranian foreign policy suggesting an intent to signal the attack as a form of retaliation. The level of detail mirrored in the\nmessaging also reduces the likelihood that the attack was a false flag operation by a country other than Iran.\n\nThe contact numbers listed in the ransom image (Figure 4), for example, were linked to multiple senior Albanian leaders,\nmirroring the cyberattacks on Iran’s railways and fueling pumps, which included a contact phone number belonging to\nthe Iranian Supreme Leader’s Office.\nThe messages in the information operations also emphasized targeting of corrupt government politicians and their\nsupport for terrorists and an interest in not harming the Albanian people (Figure 5). Similarly, the attack on Iranian steel\n[companies claimed to target the steel factories for their connections to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC)](https://twitter.com/GonjeshkeDarand/status/1541288345183158272?cxt=HHwWgIC88a7l4OMqAAAA)\n[while avoiding harm to Iranians. Another cyberattack on an Iranian airline in late 2021, which was claimed by](https://www.timesofisrael.com/blacklisted-iranian-airlines-targeted-in-cyberattack/)\nHooshyaran-e Vatan (meaning “Observants of the Fatherland” in Farsi), emphasized Tehran’s corruption and\nmisappropriation of money on IRGC activities abroad.\n\nFigure 5.\n\nMessage from Homeland Justice days after the cyberattack.\n\n### Timing\n\n\n-----\n\n[The cyberattack on July 15 occurred weeks after a string of cyberattacks on Iran, one week ahead of the MEK sponsored](https://www.iranintl.com/en/202207032504)\nFree Iran World Summit and aligned with other Iranian policy moves against the MEK, further bolstering the likelihood of\nIranian involvement. On July 16, the day after the cyberattack, Iran’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued [a statement](https://www.iranintl.com/en/202207162442)\ndesignating current and former American politicians for supporting the MEK. The Free Iran World Summit, which the Iranian\n[regime actively opposes, was canceled this year following warnings of possible terrorist threats to the Summit on July 21. A](https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/terror-threat-cancels-iranian-oppositions-summit-albania-87267980)\nfew days after the planned Free Iran World Summit, Iranian official press issued an editorial calling for military action against\nthe MEK in Albania. This string of events suggests there may have been a whole-of-government Iranian effort to counter the\nMEK from Iran’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to intelligence agencies, to official press outlets.\n\n### Target selection\n\nSome of the Albanian organizations targeted in the destructive attack were the equivalent organizations and government\nagencies in Iran that experienced prior cyberattacks with MEK-related messaging. This suggests the Iranian government\nchose those targets to signal the cyberattacks as a form of direct and proportional retaliation, a common tactic of the regime.\n\n## Parallel information operations and amplification\n\nBefore and after the Homeland Justice messaging campaign was launched, social media persona accounts and a group of\nreal-life Iranian and Albanian nationals known for their pro-Iran, anti-MEK views, promoted the campaign’s general talking\npoints and amplified the leaks published by the Homeland Justice accounts online. The parallel promotion of the Homeland\nJustice campaign and its central themes by these entities in the online space—before and after the cyberattack—suggests a\nbroad-based information operation aimed at amplifying the impact of the attack.\n\nAhead of the cyberattack, on June 6, Ebrahim Khodabandeh, a disaffected former MEK member posted [an open letter](https://web.archive.org/web/20220907003825/https:/www.nejatngo.org/en/posts/14089)\naddressed to Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama warning of the consequences of escalating tensions with Iran. Invoking\n[“[h]acking of Tehran municipal systems” and “gas stations,” Khodabandeh claimed that the MEK was the source of](https://www.npr.org/2021/10/27/1049566231/irans-president-says-cyberattack-was-meant-to-create-disorder-at-gas-pumps)\n“sabotaging acts against the interests of the Iranian people [sic]” and argued that these constituted “the hostile work of your\ngovernment” and has caused “obvious enmity with the Iranian nation [sic].”\n\nFour days later, on June 10, Khodabandeh and the Nejat Society, an anti-MEK NGO that he heads, hosted a group of\nAlbanian nationals in Iran. The group included members of another anti-MEK organization called the Association for the\nSupport of Iranians Living in Albania (ASILA)—Gjergji Thanasi, Dashamir Mersuli, and Vladimir Veis. Given the highly political\nnature of ASILA’s work on issues related to a group that Tehran considers a terrorist organization (the MEK), it is highly\npossible that this visit was conducted with sanction from the state. Upon their return from Iran, on July 12, Nejat Society said\n[Albanian police raided their offices and detained some ASILA members. While Nejat Society said this raid was a result of](https://archive.vn/zhR7m)\n[“false and baseless accusations,” according to local media the raid stemmed from possible connections to Iranian intelligence](https://nacionale.com/kulture/beteja-mes-muhaxhedineve-dhe-revolucionareve-ne-iran-eskalon-ne-panairin-e-librit-ne-durres)\nservices.\n\nFigure 6.\n\nASILA members in Iran in June 2022 Pictured from left are Gjergji Thanasi Ebrahim Khodabandeh Dashamir Mersuli and\n\n\n-----\n\nVladimir Veis.\nIn the wake of the cyberattack, on July 23, Thanasi and Olsi Jazexhi, another Albanian national who frequently appears on\n[Iran’s state-sponsored media outlet PressTV espousing anti-MEK positions, penned a second open letter addressed to then-](https://archive.vn/N8yZN)\nAlbanian President Ilir Meta, also published on Nejat Society’s website. This letter echoed Homeland Justice’s central claim—\nnamely that Albania’s continuing to host the MEK constituted a danger to the Albanian people. Jazexhi and Thanasi called on\nMeta to convene Albania’s National Security Council to “consider whether Albania has entered into a cyber and military\nconflict with the Islamic Republic of Iran.”\n\nIn May 2021, at around the same time that Iranian actors began their intrusion into Albanian government victim systems,\naccounts for [two anti-MEK](https://twitter.com/ali_pouladi) [social media personas, which do not appear to correspond to real people, were created on both](https://twitter.com/OliverCarol11)\nFacebook and Twitter. The accounts largely post anti-MEK content and engage with the social media accounts of some of the\nindividuals detailed above. These two accounts along with a third, older account, were among the first to promote posts from\nHomeland Justice accounts on Twitter, and all three dramatically increased the rate of anti-MEK posts after the mid-July 2022\ncyberattack became public.\n\nThere exists some additional evidence that the role of these personas extended beyond mere social media amplification and\ninto content production. One of the personas which repeatedly posted Homeland Justice content had previously written for the\n[now-defunct IRGC-linked American Herald Tribune and other fringe news sites, often in negative terms about the MEK. A](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/united-states-seizes-27-additional-domain-names-used-iran-s-islamic-revolutionary-guard-corps)\n[second persona account, meanwhile, may have attempted to contact at least one Albanian newspaper ahead of the hack-](https://web.archive.org/web/20220907002152/https:/twitter.com/ali_pouladi/status/1560161092231380994)\nand-leak, requesting “cooperation”, and the ability to publish with the outlet.\n\nThe parallel promotion of the Homeland Justice campaign and its central themes by these individuals and personas online\nboth before and after the cyberattack adds a compelling human dimension to the broader Homeland Justice influence effort.\nWhile there were no observed direct relationships between the threat actors responsible for the destructive attack and these\nmessaging actors, their actions raise questions worthy of further examination.\n\n## Observed actor activity\n\n[DART and MSTIC supported the post ransom and wiper attack analysis leveraging Microsoft 365 Defender and collection of](https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/siem-and-xdr/microsoft-365-defender)\nadditional forensic artifacts. Analysis identified the use of vulnerabilities to implant web shells for persistence, reconnaissance\nactions, common credential harvesting techniques, defense evasion methods to disable security products, and a final attempt\nof actions on objective deploying encryption and wiping binaries. The Iranian sponsored attempt at destruction had less than a\n10% total impact on the customer environment.\n\n### Access and implant\n\nBased on investigative analysis, starting in May 2021, actors exploited vulnerabilities of a public-facing endpoint to execute\narbitrary code that implanted web shells on the unpatched SharePoint server (Collab-Web2.*.*), as stated previously. These\ngeneric web shells provided the ability to upload files, download files, delete files, rename, execute commands with an option\nto run as specific user.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7.\n\nThe web shell console from the attacker’s point of view\nWeb shells were placed in the following directories:\n\nC:\\Program Files\\Common Files\\microsoft shared\\Web Server\nExtensions\\16\\TEMPLATE\\LAYOUTS\\evaluatesiteupgrade.cs.aspx\nC:\\Program Files\\Common Files\\microsoft shared\\Web Server Extensions\\16\\TEMPLATE\\LAYOUTS\\Pickers.aspx\nC:\\ProgramData\\COM1\\frontend\\Error4.aspx\n\n### Lateral movement and execution\n\nFollowing initial access and implant, the threat actor was observed using Mimikatz for credential harvesting and a combination\nof Impacket and Remote Desktop Clients for lateral movement efforts using the built-in administrator account. Unrecoverable\ntooling was identified, which highly suggests that reconnaissance efforts were present in the form of file names of\nexecutables, resident mailbox data, database, and user details. Similar actions by the threat actors observed by MSTIC and\nDART detail both custom and open-source tooling utilized for these efforts. Artifacts of tooling identified:\n\nIPGeter.exe\nFindUser.exe\nrecdisc.exe\nNetE.exe\nadvanced_port_scanner.exe\nmimikatz.exe\nshared.exe\nStored CSV and TXT files\n\n### Data collection\n\n\n-----\n\nDuring the period of October 2021 January 2022, the threat actors used a unique email exfiltration tool which interacted with\nthe Exchange web services APIs to collect email in a manner that masked the actions. The threat actors accomplished these\nactions by creating an identity named “HealthMailbox55x2yq” to mimic a Microsoft Exchange Health Manager Service account\nusing Exchange PowerShell commands on the Exchange Servers. The threat actors then added the account to the highly\nprivileged exchange built-in role group “Organization Management” to later add the role of “Application Impersonation”. The\n[ApplicationImpersonation management role enables applications to impersonate users in an organization to perform tasks on](https://docs.microsoft.com/exchange/applicationimpersonation-role-exchange-2013-help)\nbehalf of the user, providing the ability for the application to act as the owner of a mailbox.\n\n### Defense evasion\n\nPrior to launching the final stage of the attack, the threat actors gained administrative access to a deployed endpoint detection\nand response (EDR) solution to make modifications, removing libraries that affected the agents across the enterprise. In\naddition, a binary to disable components of Microsoft Defender Antivirus was propagated using custom tooling. The\ndistributed binary named disable-defender.exe queries for TokenElevation using the GetTokenInformation API and checks if\nthe process is running with elevated privileges. If the token is not running with elevated privilege, the binary prints “Must run\nas admin!\\n”. If the token is elevated, it queries TokenUser and checks if the SID is “S-1-5-18”. If the current process doesn’t\nrun under system context, it prints “Restarting with privileges\\n” and attempts to elevate the privilege.\n\nTo elevate the privilege, the binary checks if the TrustedInstaller service is enabled. To do this, it starts the service\n“SeDebugPrivilege” and “SeImpersonatePrivilege” to assign privileges to itself. It then looks for winlogon.exe process,\nacquires its token, and impersonates calling thread using ImpersonateLoggedOnUser/SetThreadToken. After impersonating\nas winlogon.exe, it opens TrustedInstaller process, acquires its token for impersonation and creates a new process with\nelevated privileges using CreateProcessWithTokenW.\n\nFigure 8.

The first method remote file copied the ransom binary GoXml.exe and a bat_\nfile that triggers the execution of the ransom or wiper on a user login. The second method was by remotely invoking the\nransom binary with the Mellona.exe tool, post SMB remote file copy.\n\nFigure 9.\n\nProcess Command lines for Mellona.exe used to distribute malware\n_win.bat – Batch file for ransom execution – Trojan:Win32/BatRunGoXml_\n\nExecutes the ransom binary from the All Users starts up folder and will be executed on the trigger of a user login.\n\nFigure 10.
