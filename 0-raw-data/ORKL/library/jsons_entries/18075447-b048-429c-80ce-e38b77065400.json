Those investments are paying off as\nthreat actors continue to target mobile users with successful campaigns.\n\n[In October, the Zimperium zLabs team informed the community about GriftHorse, a massive](https://blog.zimperium.com/grifthorse-android-trojan-steals-millions-from-over-10-million-victims-globally/)\nmobile premium service abuse campaign that compromised around 10 million victims\nglobally. In the pursuit of identifying and taking down similar financially motivated scams,\nzLabs researchers have discovered another premium service abuse campaign with\n**upwards of 105 million victims globally, which we have named Dark Herring. The total**\namount of money scammed out of unsuspecting users could once again be well into the\nhundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nThese malicious Android applications appear harmless when looking at the store\ndescription and requested permissions, but this false sense of confidence changes when\nusers get charged month over month for premium service they are not receiving via direct\ncarrier billing. Direct carrier billing, or DCB, is the mobile payment method that allows\nconsumers to send charges of purchase made to their phone bills with their phone number.\nUnlike many other malicious applications that provide no functional capabilities, the victim\ncan use these applications, meaning they are often left installed on the phones and tablets\nlong after initial installation.\n\nThreat intelligence on the active Dark Herring Android Scamware campaign revealed that\nthe date of publication of the apps dates back to March 2020. To date, Dark Herring is the\nlongest-running mobile SMS scam discovered by the Zimperium zLabs team.\n\nThese malicious applications were initially distributed through both Google Play and thirdparty application stores. Zimperium zLabs reported the findings to both Google and the web\nhosts, who verified the provided information and removed the malicious materials as part of\na coordinated takedown. At the time of publishing, the scam services and phishing\n**sites are no longer active, and Google has removed all the malicious applications**\n**from Google Play.**\n\n\n-----\n\nHowever, the malicious applications are still available on third-party app repositories, once\nagain highlighting the risk of sideloading applications to mobile endpoints and the need for\nadvanced on-device security.\n\n_Disclosure: As a key member of the Google App Defense Alliance, Zimperium scans_\n_applications before they are published and provides an ongoing analysis of Android_\n_apps in the Google Play Store._\n\nIn this blog, we will:\n\nCover the capabilities of the scamware;\nDiscuss the architecture of the applications;\nShow the communication with the C&C server; and\nExplore the global impact of this campaign.\n\n## Summary of Dark Herring Android Scamware\n\nThe Dark Herring mobile applications pose a threat to all Android devices by functioning as\na scamware that subscribes users to paid services, charging an average monthly premium\nof $15 USD per month. This campaign has targeted millions of users from over 70 countries\nby serving targeted malicious web pages to users based on the geo-location of their IP\naddress with the local language. This social engineering trick is exceptionally successful\nand effective as users are generally more comfortable with sharing information to a website\nin their local language.\n\nUpon infection, the Dark Herring-infected application communicates with the C&C server,\nexposing the victim’s IP address. Based on the geolocation of the IP address, the decision\nto target the victim for Direct Carrier Billing subscription or not is taken by using server-side\nlogic. The malware redirects the victim to a geo-specific webpage where they are asked to\nsubmit their phone numbers for verification. But in reality, they are submitting their phone\nnumber to a Direct Carrier Billing service that begins charging them an average of $15 USD\nper month. The victim does not immediately notice the impact of the theft, and the likelihood\nof the billing continuing for months before detection is high, with little to no recourse to get\none’s money back.\n\nThe threat actors responsible for Dark Herring generated and published almost 470\n**applications on the Google Play Store over a long period, with the earliest submission**\ndating to March 2020 and as recently as November 2021. The number of applications\nattributed to this campaign indicates that the motivated and persistent threat actors are\ncontinuously scaling up their architecture and resources to infect as many victims as\npossible to maximize their gains.\n\nZimperium zLabs researchers have noticed a pattern in the C&C communication, which\nsuggests that the threat actors have developed an infrastructure to handle the\ncommunication coming from several applications with unique identifiers and responding\n\n\n-----\n\naccordingly.\n\nThe download statistics reveal that more than 105 million Android devices had this\n**scamware installed, potentially falling victim to this campaign globally, possibly suffering**\nincalculable financial losses. The cybercriminal group behind this campaign has built a\nstable cash flow of illicit funds from these victims, generating millions in recurring revenue\neach month, with the total amount stolen potentially well into the hundreds of millions.\n\n## How does the Dark Herring Android Scamware work?\n\nOnce the Android application is installed and launched, a URL that acts as the first-stage\nendpoint is loaded into a webview. The URL can be retrieved from a hard-coded string, the\nresource strings, or decrypting a string. The first-stage URL is always an endpoint hosted\non Cloudfront. The initial GET request sent to the Cloudfront URL is shown in Figure 1.\n\nFigure.1: The GET request to first-stage URL containing the application’s package name\nThe response contains the links to JavaScript files hosted on AWS instances, and the\napplication fetches all the resources to proceed with the infection process, as shown in\nFigure.2.\n\nOne of such JS files instructs the application to get a unique identifier for the device by\nmaking a POST request to the “live/keylookup” API endpoint and then constructing a finalstage URL.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure.2: The response from the first-stage URL\n\nFigure.3: The JavaScript code from one of the endpoints retrieved from the first-stage URL\n\n\n-----\n\nThe baseurl variable, as seen in Figure 3, is used to make a POST request that contains\nunique identifiers created by the application to identify the device and the language and\ncountry details.\n\nFigure.4: The POST request containing the data about the victim’s device.\nThe response from the above endpoint contains the configuration for the application’s\nbehavior based on the victim’s details. A list of supported countries is found in the response\nthat indicates the targeted citizens of countries will be subject to subscription of the Direct\nCarrier Billing.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigures. 5: The response from the final-stage URL containing the configuration\n\n\n-----\n\nFigures. 6: The response from the final-stage URL containing the configuration\nBased on the configuration, the webpage displayed to the victim gets customized in terms\nof the language of the text, flag, and country code.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigures. 7: Prompting the victims to enter a phone number for subscription\n\n\n-----\n\nFigures. 8: Prompting the victims to enter a phone number for subscription\n\n\n-----\n\nFigures. 9: Prompting the victims to enter a phone number for subscription\n\n## The Threat Actors\n\n\n-----\n\n[Despite the similarities in approach between this campaign and GriftHorse, the Zimperium](https://blog.zimperium.com/grifthorse-android-trojan-steals-millions-from-over-10-million-victims-globally/)\nzLabs researchers have attributed this campaign to a new group of threat actors unaffiliated\nwith the GriftHorse attackers. Several differences in the core codebase and other indicators\nare unique to this campaign, along with infrastructure investments not seen before. The\nlevel of sophistication, use of novel techniques, and determination displayed by the threat\nactors has allowed them to have such a large distribution around the world.\n\nThe Dark Herring campaign is one of the most extensive and successful malware\ncampaigns by measure of the sheer number of applications that the zLabs threat research\nteam has witnessed in 2021. Its success is attributed mainly to the rarely seen combination\nof several features:\n\nNovel techniques undetected by any other AV vendors\nAround 470 scamware applications were used in the campaign\nUse of proxies as first-stage URLs\nThe geolocation of the users based on IP is used to identify potential victims.\nVetting of application users to identify potential victims\nUsing a sophisticated architecture to obfuscate the true intent\n\nProducing a large number of malicious applications and submitting them to app stores\npoints to an extensive, concerted effort by a well-organized group. These apps are not just\nclones of each other or other apps but are uniquely produced at a high rate to deceive\ntraditional security toolsets and the potential victims.\n\nThe commonality of the malicious code and where the apps connect to it is more often than\nnot the only common facet among the over 470 applications. The evidence also points to a\nsignificant financial investment from the malicious actors in building and maintaining the\ninfrastructure to keep this global scam operating at such a high pace.\n\nIn addition to over 470 Android applications, the distribution of the applications was\nextremely well-planned, spreading their apps across multiple, varied categories, widening\nthe range of potential victims. The apps themselves also functioned as advertised,\nincreasing the false sense of confidence.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 10: The categories of the applications as per the Google Play Store\n\n## The Victims of Dark Herring Scamware\n\nThe campaign is exceptionally versatile, targeting mobile users from 70+ countries by\nchanging the application’s language and displaying the content according to the current\nuser’s IP address. Due to the nature of Direct Carrier Billing, some countries might have\nbeen targeted with less success than others due to the consumer protections set in place\nby telcos. Based on the collected intel, the Zimperium zLabs team estimates that Dark\nHerring has attempted to infect over 105 million devices since March 2020. In the map\nbelow, 70 countries have been identified with targeted victims. In the map below, nations\nhighlighted in red have the highest risks to victims due to the lack of consumer protects\nfrom these types of Direct Carrier Billing scams.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 11: Heatmap of the over 105 million potential victims spread across over 70\ncountries\n\n## Zimperium vs. Dark Herring Android Scamware\n\nZimperium zIPS customers are protected against the Dark Herring Scamware through the\non-device malware detection, anti-phishing layers, and machine learning engine with the\ncomplete Zimperium mobile threat defense solution.
