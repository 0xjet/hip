    "plain_text": "# Ukrainian Cyber Lead Says ‘At Least 4 Types of Malware’ in Use to Target Critical Infrastructure and Humanitarian Aid\n\n**nextgov.com/cybersecurity/2022/03/ukrainian-cyber-lead-least-4-types-malware-are-targeting-ukrainian-**\ninstitutions/363558/\n\nHackers allegedly affiliated with Russia are persistently targeting Ukraine’s government,\nenergy and communications systems, and humanitarian efforts amid the ongoing invasion, a\nsenior Ukrainian cybersecurity official told reporters on Wednesday.\n\n“The attackers focus on critical infrastructure, both state-owned and private, and mainly with\na connection to land-to-air invasion. Especially weighing are attacks on the logistic circuits\nand supply of the food and humanitarian support for the cities, where civilians are shelled\nand bombed,” Victor Zhora, deputy chief of Ukraine’s information protection service,\nexplained. “So, this all is crucial for the prevention of humanitarian catastrophes and we see\nthese logistic circuits are being attacked with the cyberattackers—hackers—financed and\nbasically owned by the government of the Russian Federation.”\n\nZhora provided this information during an hour-long press briefing hosted by the State\nService of Special Communication and Information Protection of Ukraine, regarding\ncyberattacks the country faced between March 15 and March 22.\n\n\n-----\n\nObserved attackers are also targeting organizations that publish information about war\ncrimes online and at least four types of malware have been deployed. According to the\nofficial, they’re called HermeticWiper, IsaacWiper, CaddyWiper and Double Zero.\n\n“The attackers used phishing campaigns to deliver [certain wiper] malware and tried to bring\nsome disruption to Ukrainian IT systems,” Zhora said.\n\n[His statements come one day after President Joe Biden’s administration reiterated warnings](https://www.nextgov.com/cybersecurity/2022/03/white-house-warns-potential-russian-cyberattack-based-new-intel/363425/)\nthat the Russian government “is exploring options for potential cyberattacks” against America\nbased on evolving intelligence.\n\n[Moscow has largely rejected allegations that it is conducting malicious cyber pursuits amid](https://www.reuters.com/world/russia-rejects-claims-it-was-responsible-cyberattack-ukraine-2022-02-19/)\n[this conflict, and the Kremlin dismissed those White House claims.](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/kremlin-accuses-us-state-level-banditry-rejects-cyber-attack-plans-2022-03-22/)\n\nStill, Zhora noted that the Ukrainian government is supporting companies that might be\naffected, in response to what the country views as Russia-affiliated cyber incidents.\n\n“As far as we understand, the same approach—warning of businesses of this threat to come\n—is being taken by the United States, and to be prepared for the upcoming attacks from\nRussia is our recommendation as well—especially given the fact that some of the attacking\ngroups that we identified are behind the attacks on the European charity organizations\nworking with Ukrainian refugees,” he said. “Basically, we suppose that this is another proof of\nthe spread of cyberwar to NATO countries, since these charity organizations are European\norganizations which aim to help Ukrainian civilians to overcome this terrible situation.”\n\nMuch of Ukraine’s telecommunications infrastructure is privately owned, according to Zhora.\nIn his view, telecom professionals who continue operating “under these highly risky\nconditions” and restoring connections when they are broken mark “one of factors that\nprobably can explain the success of Ukrainian resistance.”\n\nBut the Ukrainian government is not organizing offensive cyber operations with others\nagainst Russia, he said.\n\n“So I cannot say that we are hacking back,” Zhora noted. “But, obviously, this is done by\nvolunteers and by citizens who have appropriate skills to do this.”\n\nX\n\nThis website uses cookies to enhance user experience and to analyze performance and\ntraffic on our website.
