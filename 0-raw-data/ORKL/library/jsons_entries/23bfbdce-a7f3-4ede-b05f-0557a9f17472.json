These reports\nprovide analysis on specific malware families or new samples, describe the activities of a\nparticular ransomware group, give general tips on how to prevent ransomware from working,\nand so on. Malware analysts and security professionals can learn a lot from these reports,\nbut not much of the content has an immediate or practical use. With the release of the report\n_Common TTPs of modern ransomware, Kaspersky experts have taken a different approach._\nWe want to familiarize the reader with the different stages of ransomware deployment, how\ncybercriminals use RATs and other tools across the various stages and what they aim to\nachieve. The report also provides a visual guide to defending against targeted ransomware\nattacks, using the most prolific groups as examples, and introduces the reader to the SIGMA\ndetection rules that we created.\n\n## What are the ransomware groups?\n\nFor the report we selected the eight most common ransomware groups:\n\n1. Conti/Ryuk\n2. Pysa\n3. Clop (TA505)\n4. Hive\n5. Lockbit2.0\n6. RagnarLocker\n7. BlackByte\n8. BlackCat\n\nWe analyzed in detail the attacks these groups perpetrated and employed techniques and\ntactics described in MITRE ATT&CK to identify a large number of shared TTPs. By tracking\nall the groups and detecting their attacks, we saw that the core techniques remain the same\nthroughout the cyber kill chain. The attack patterns revealed are not accidental because this\nclass of attack requires the hackers to go through certain stages, such as penetrating the\ncorporate network or victim’s computer, delivering malware, further discovery, account\nhijacking, deleting shadow copies, removing backups and, finally, achieving their objectives.\n\nTo highlight the common components and TTPs shared by the ransomware groups across\ndifferent attack patterns, we’ve created a common cyber kill chain diagram. It provides a\nvisual representation of the techniques and tactics used by different ransomware operators.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nOnce the incident data relating to the ransomware groups has been collected, we can\nidentify the TTPs characteristic of each of them and then superimpose these onto the shared\ncyber kill chain. The arrows indicate the sequence of specific techniques and the colours\nmark the individual groups that have been known to deploy these techniques.\n\n## Whom is the report for?\n\nThis report is written for SOC analysts, threat hunting teams, cyberthreat intelligence\nanalysts, digital forensics specialists and cybersecurity specialists that are involved in the\nincident response process and/or want to protect the environment they are responsible for\nfrom targeted ransomware attacks. Our main goal is to help with understanding how\nransomware groups generally operate and how to defend against their attacks.\n\nYou can use this report as a book of knowledge on the main techniques used by ransomware\ngroups, for writing hunting rules and for auditing your security solutions.\n\n## The report contains\n\nTactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) of eight modern ransomware groups:\nConti/Ryuk, Pysa, Clop (TA505), Hive, Lockbit2.0, RagnarLocker, BlackByte, and\nBlackCat\nA description of how different groups share more than half of the common components\nand TTPs, with the core attack stages being executed identically across groups\nA cyber kill chain diagram that combines the visible intersections and common\nelements of the selected ransomware groups and makes it possible to predict the\nthreat actors’ next steps\nA detailed analysis of each technique with examples of how they are being used by\nvarious groups and a comprehensive list of mitigations\nSIGMA rules based on described TTPs that can be applied to SIEM solutions\n\n**Fill the form below to download the Common TTPs of modern ransomware report**\n**(English, PDF)**\n\n[Cybercrime](https://securelist.com/tag/cybercrime/)\n[Malware Technologies](https://securelist.com/tag/malware-technologies/)\n[Ransomware](https://securelist.com/tag/ransomware/)\n[Targeted attacks](https://securelist.com/tag/targeted-attacks/)\n[TTPs](https://securelist.com/tag/ttps/)\n\nAuthors\n\n\n-----\n\nNikita Nazarov\n\nVasily Davydov\n\n[Natalya Shornikova](https://securelist.com/author/natalyashornikova/)\n\n[Vladislav Burtsev](https://securelist.com/author/vladislavburtsev/)\n\n[Danila Nasonov](https://securelist.com/author/danilanasonov/)\n\nThe hateful eight: Kaspersky’s guide to modern ransomware groups’ TTPs\n\nYour email address will not be published.
