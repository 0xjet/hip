Meaning,\n\nit doesn't resemble a \"fully exposed buttock.\"\nCriminals have compromised tens of thousands of Facebook accounts in the past few days\nusing malware that masquerades as a paint program for relieving stress.\n\n\"Relieve Stress Paint\" is available through a domain that uses Unicode representation to\nshow up as aol.net on search engines and in emails, researchers from security firm Radware\nsaid in a [post published Wednesday morning. (This query showed the trojan was also](https://blog.radware.com/security/2018/04/stresspaint-malware-campaign-targeting-facebook-credentials/)\navailable on a domain that was designed to appear as picc.com.) The researchers suspect\nthe malware is being promoted in spam emails.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Enlarge](https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/spoofed-websites.png)\nOnce installed, the malware acts as a legitimate paint program that changes colors and line\nsize with each user click. Behind the scenes, it copies Chrome data that stores cookies and\nany saved passwords for previously accessed Facebook accounts.\n\n[Enlarge](https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/facebook-data-theft.png)\nRadware\n\"Stresspaint,\" as Radware has dubbed the hidden program, continues to copy the Facebook\ncredentials each time a target opens Relieve Stress Paint and each time the computer\nrestarts. The data is sent to a command-and-control server. Radware researchers were able\nto access the command server's interface, which showed that more than 40,000 computers\nhad been infected by the malware in recent days. In the process, tens of thousands of\nFacebook accounts were compromised. The interface also compiled any payment details\ntied to an account, the number of friends the account had, and whether the account was\nused to manage a page.\n\nThe interface also included a section for viewing credentials for victims' Amazon accounts. It\nwas empty, leading Radware to suspect the attackers hadn't yet enabled code that would\nactually compromise those accounts. Radware also detected another variant of the malware\nand saw an indication of it in the control panel.\n\n## Stealth\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware was designed to copy the credentials in a way that wouldn t be detected by\nantivirus programs. The copying process, for instance, remained active for less than one\nminute. The malware didn't steal general credentials, and it copied cookies and saved\npasswords by querying copies of the original cookies and LoginData files rather than through\nother means.\n\nIt remains unclear precisely what the attackers did with data they obtained. Possibilities\ninclude selling the data in criminal forums, using it for identity theft or espionage, or using the\npayment data to buy goods or services on e-commerce sites.\n\nMore than five days earlier this week, the malware managed to infect nearly 34,000\ncomputers in two dozen countries.\n\n[Enlarge](https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/facebook-malware-infections.png)\nRadware\nSince then, more than 6,000 more infections have occurred.\n\nAnyone who may have been infected by this malware should immediately change their\n[password and should also check the security and login section of their Facebook settings for](https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=security)\nlogins by unrecognized computers. It's always a good idea to protect accounts with\nmultifactor authentication, but it's not yet clear if that protection would have prevented\nattackers in this campaign from accessing compromised accounts. Because the malware\nstole both passwords and cookies, it's possible the cookies allowed the attackers to bypass\nthe protection.\n\nIn a statement, Facebook officials wrote: \"We are investigating these malware findings and\nwe are taking steps to help protect and notify those who are impacted.\" A spokesman said it\nwasn't yet clear what effect the attacks had on accounts protected by multifactor\nauthentication.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis ability to infect 40,000 users and compromise tens of thousands of accounts indicates\nthe malware was developed professionally. It wouldn't be surprising to see this group strike\n[again.
