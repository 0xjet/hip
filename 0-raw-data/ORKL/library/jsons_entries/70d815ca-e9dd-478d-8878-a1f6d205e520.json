Although this\ncollaboration has primarily occurred between gangs developing and distributing well-known\nbanking Trojans, such as Emotet, TrickBot and IcedID, it does not stop there. In a new and\ndangerous twist to this trend, IBM X-Force Incident Response and Intelligence Services (IRIS)\nresearch believes that the elite cybercriminal threat actor ITG08, also known as FIN6, has\npartnered with the malware gang behind one of the most active Trojans — TrickBot — to use\nTrickBot’s new malware framework dubbed “Anchor” against organizations for financial profit.\n\nThe Anchor malware framework itself is not new and its origins date back to at least 2018. It\nappears to be tightly connected to TrickBot and is likely programmed by the same malware\n[authors that work on TrickBot. Cybersecurity firms SentinelOne and](https://labs.sentinelone.com/the-deadly-planeswalker-how-the-trickbot-group-united-high-tech-crimeware-apt/) [Cybereason have published](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/dropping-anchor-from-a-trickbot-infection-to-the-discovery-of-the-anchor-malware)\nreports in recent months describing Anchor as new malware developed by the TrickBot gang for\nuse in targeted attacks against enterprises, including a new PowerShell-based backdoor called\n[PowerTrick.](https://labs.sentinelone.com/top-tier-russian-organized-cybercrime-group-unveils-fileless-stealthy-powertrick-backdoor-for-high-value-targets/)\n\n## ITG08 and TrickBot — A Loaded Duo\n\nITG08/FIN6 is an organized cybercrime gang that has been active since 2015, primarily targeting\npoint-of-sale (POS) machines in brick-and-mortar retailers and companies in the hospitality\nsector across the U.S. and Europe. TrickBot is a banking Trojan that emerged in 2016 and has\nsince grown to be one of the top, and most sophisticated, Trojans being used by organized\ncybercrime gangs believed to be hailing out of Russia.\n\n[In the past six months, the Anchor backdoor malware, which includes a variant that](https://technical.nttsecurity.com/post/102fsp2/trickbot-variant-anchor-dns-communicating-over-dns)\ncommunicates over DNS (Anchor_DNS), has been used in targeted attacks on enterprise\nnetworks — including POS systems — following initial infection by the TrickBot Trojan. The way\norganizations are being attacked ties with typical ITG08 activity reported throughout the past few\nyears.\n\nThrough connecting our own findings with information from other security research reports, XForce IRIS has determined that the threat actor ITG08 has partnered with the TrickBot gang to\nuse that group’s PowerTrick and Anchor backdoor malware for attacks on high-profile targets.\nThis post provides more detail on that connection.\n\n## Tying ITG08 (FIN6) With Use of TrickBot’s Anchor Framework\n\nA past analysis by X-Force IRIS gave [extensive information about ITG08’s use of a backdoor](https://securityintelligence.com/posts/more_eggs-anyone-threat-actor-itg08-strikes-again/)\nknown as “More_eggs”. The gang’s relationship with the boutique underground provider selling\nthe [TerraLoader loader and More_eggs backdoor leads to direct evidence of its use of](https://medium.com/@quoscient/the-chicken-keeps-laying-new-eggs-uncovering-new-gc-maas-tools-used-by-top-tier-threat-actors-531d80a6b4e9)\nPowerTrick and Anchor.\n\nBringing this cybercrime seller back into the picture, SentinelOne researchers reported observing\na threat actor using PowerTrick and Anchor to download two samples developed and sold by the\nsame seller: a TerraLoader that installs the More_eggs backdoor and a TerraLoader that deploys\n\n\n-----\n\na signed Metasploit shellcode loader. The evidence provided below links these two samples to\nITG08.\n\n### More_eggs Sample Analysis\n\nX-Force IRIS is almost certain the TerraLoader and More_eggs samples were purchased by\nITG08 based on similarities with two other More_eggs samples. We encountered the first sample\nin 2019 during an investigation of attacks we attributed to ITG08. We found the second sample, a\nTerraloader dropping a More_eggs backdoor, in a public repository that also showed ties to the\nITG08 group.\n\n\n**TerraLoader**\n**/**\n\n**More_eggs**\n\n**sample**\n\n\nDownloaded by PowerTrick\n(SentinelOne)\n\n\nITG08 use in early 2019 (XForce IRIS)\n\n\nFound in VirusTotal\n\n\n**C2 Domain** drive.staticcontent[.]kz metric.onlinefonts[.]kz host.moresecurity[.]kz\n\n\n**Domain**\n\n**registration**\n\n**date**\n\n**Domain**\n\n**registration**\n\n**email**\n\n**More_eggs**\n**RKey**\n\n**TerraLoader**\n\n**compile**\n\n**date**\n\n\n2/28/2019 2/28/2019 2/28/2019\n\n[[email protected]](https://securityintelligence.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) [[email protected]](https://securityintelligence.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) [[email protected]](https://securityintelligence.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)\n\nZkY3egXBulkogSbGEHqdA ZkY3egXBulkogSbGEHqdA wearenotcobaltthanks\n\n3/18/2019 n/a 3/4/2019\n\n\n_Table 1: Comparison of three More_eggs samples and their command-and-control (C&C)_\n_domains_\n\nAll three C&C domains were created at the same time using the same email registration\naddress.\nTwo of the samples — the one downloaded by Anchor and the one attributed to ITG08 —\nuse the same RKey, which is used in part to encrypt communications with the C&C host.\nTwo of the TerraLoaders were compiled within two weeks of each other. The remaining\nTerraLoader could not be recovered.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe RKey in the final sample, wearenotcobaltthanks, is a reference to the Cobalt Gang\ngroup, which previously had used the More_eggs backdoor. X-Force IRIS has found a\nsimilar message in other More_eggs samples attributed to ITG08: a variable called\n“Researchers” with the content, “We are not cobalt gang, stop associating us with such\nskids!”\n\n### Metasploit Shellcode Loader Sample Analysis\n\nSentinelOne previously observed Anchor downloading a signed TerraLoader. That first step was\nfollowed by installing an Apache Bench executable hollowed out with a Metasploit loader\nshellcode that received an RC4 encrypted payload.\n\nX-Force IRIS lacks the sample hash or code-signing certificate to attribute this malware\ndefinitively to ITG08, but it is very similar to other samples we did attribute to the ITG08 group.\n\nIn 2019, X-Force IRIS observed ITG08 employ a signed Metasploit shellcode loader\nmasquerading as the Apache Bench application and containing a Comodo code-signing\ncertificate issued to “MAHTEM LTD.” The shellcode was loaded into memory and designed to\nreceive an RC4-encrypted buffer. This sample was used during an intrusion that featured the use\nof More_eggs.\n\nX-Force IRIS identified a signed TerraLoader in a public repository that also decrypts a shellcode\nloader masquerading as Apache Bench. The sample used a code-signing certificate issued to\n“D. Bacte Ltd.”, which we found in other samples that we attributed to ITG08 in some of our\nprevious investigations.\n\n## More Evidence of ITG08’s (FIN6) Fingerprints on TrickBot Malware\n\nFurther clues connect ITG08 to TrickBot and its operators’ other malware. Generally speaking,\nthe tactics used to deploy More_eggs in victim environments, as well as other threat actor\ntactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) used during these Anchor campaigns, are unusually\nconsistent with those used by ITG08.\n\n### More_eggs & TerraLoader Deployment\n\nAccording to SentinelOne, the threat actor used PowerShell to download and execute a\nTerraLoader that installed More_eggs. X-Force IRIS has observed ITG08 employ the same tactic\nwhereby it used PowerShell and Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to download and\nexecute TerraLoader, then install More_eggs on remote hosts. X-Force IRIS has not observed\nany other actors who use More_eggs employ this tactic. Those who do typically install\nMore_eggs only during the initial infection, after which they download additional malware or tools\nto proceed with their intrusion phase.\n\n### TTPs Consistent With ITG08\n\n\n-----\n\nIn a blog about the subject, researchers from Cybereason noted that many of the threat actor\nTTPs they observed while using the Anchor framework were consistent with FIN6 activity,\nincluding the targeting of POS systems and the use of tools such as Metasploit, Cobalt Strike\nand AdFind.\n\nX-Force IRIS has also encountered these TTPs in attacks that we attributed to ITG08. While\nthese TTPs alone are insufficient to attribute the activity to ITG08, they are nevertheless fully\nconsistent with ITG08 activity.\n\nOn a final note, X-Force IRIS is unaware of other threat actors deploying the combination of\nTerraLoader, More_eggs and Metasploit shellcode loaders in the manner described above. This\nactivity, combined with the additional TTPs attributed to ITG08, such as the use of Metasploit,\nCobalt Strike and AdFind while targeting POS systems, leads us to conclude with confidence\nthat ITG08 is one of the threat actors using TrickBot’s PowerTrick and the Anchor malware\nframework.\n\n## ITG08 Connecting to Evolve\n\nITG08’s partnership with the TrickBot gang to use its Anchor malware framework is the latest\nexample of a cybercriminal group that has repeatedly demonstrated its ability to adopt new\nmalware and adapt to changing circumstances that threaten the group’s ability to obtain illicit\nproceeds. In this respect, ITG08 behaves much like a commercial enterprise: adopting new\ntechnology, building strategic partnerships and grappling with changing markets by moving into\nnew “lines of business” while leveraging their core strengths and outsourcing those of other\ngroups.\n\nITG08’s partnership with the TrickBot gang not only provides the group with new malware and\npotential access to enterprises infected with the TrickBot Trojan; it also reveals additional\nevidence of the group’s strategy to partner with other threat actors and malware developers.\nThese varied relationships with elite cybercriminal actors and those who sell them tools, access\nand software allow ITG08 to continue to rely on its strengths in post-exploitation tactics, such as\nlateral movement, privilege escalation and data exfiltration, and outsource other attack vectors\nas needed.\n\nThe partnership with TrickBot is not the only evolution for ITG08. In recent years, this group has\nevolved to employ additional means to obtain illicit proceeds, including the targeting of ecommerce environments by injecting malicious code into online checkout pages of compromised\nwebsites in a modus operandi known as “Magecart.”\n\nITG08 also maintains established relationships with underground malware suppliers, such as the\none responsible for developing and selling the TerraLoader loader and More_eggs JScript\nbackdoor. ITG08 continues to benefit from its relationship with the developer behind More_eggs,\nwhose malware features very low antivirus detection rates and makes use of other methods to\nevade detection, such as bypassing application whitelisting.\n\n\n-----\n\n[ITG08 has also been targeting e-commerce environments with a technique known as online](https://usa.visa.com/dam/VCOM/global/support-legal/documents/fin6-cybercrime-group-expands-threat-To-ecommerce-merchants.pdf)\nskimming or grouped under what’s known as Magecart activity. In fact, ITG08 is the same group\nas [Magecart Group 6. This relatively new activity almost certainly is a response to the adoption](https://twitter.com/ydklijnsma/status/1167837317232377856)\nof EMV chips and point-to-point encryption.\n\n[ITG08 may also be part of attacks that deploy ransomware, such as Ryuk, LockerGoga and](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2019/04/pick-six-intercepting-a-fin6-intrusion.html)\n[MegaCortex, again in likely partnership with banking Trojan botnets, which could be a further](https://securityintelligence.com/posts/banking-trojans-and-ransomware-a-treacherous-matrimony-bound-to-get-worse/)\nattempt to move into new “markets” that do not rely on the need to monetize credit card data.\n\nFinancially motivated, adaptable, sophisticated and persistent, ITG08 is likely to remain one of\nthe most potent cybercriminal groups in this new decade.\n\n[Listen to a podcast episode on the impact of the ITG08 threat group](https://securityintelligence.com/media/exploring-the-impact-of-the-itg08-threat-group/)\n\n## Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)\n\n**More_eggs C&C:**\n\nhxxps://drive.staticcontent[.]kz/drive/info\n\nhxxps://metric.onlinefonts[.]kz/metric/inf\n\nhxxps://host.moresecurity[.]kz/host/info\n\n**Metasploit Shellcode Loaders:**\n\nd9a245f1fb502606c226c364aa1090f25916e68f5ff24ef75be87ad6a2e6dcc9\n\nd39f8aa90d54fd010484d7bb54c18549c3f03b02385020a35589dbe49e979bab\n\n**TerraLoaders dropping More_eggs:**\n\ndcf714bfc35071af9fa04c4329c94e385472388f9715f2da7496b415f1a5aa03\n\n49af65995e51d88bbe8b0d4be5a5df2692aa57800f1875a18ecbd3f483c8a094\n\n[Ole Villadsen](https://securityintelligence.com/author/ole-villadsen/)\nCyber Threat Hunt Analyst, IBM Security\n\nOle Villadsen is an analyst on the Threat Hunt & Discovery Team within IBM X-Force Incident\nResponse and Intelligence Services (IRIS), where he investiga...\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----",
