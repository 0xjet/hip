This page no longer\nexists, but at the time of the attack, it was distributing a file at hxxps://forums.iobit.com/free-iobit-license-promo.zip.\n\n[This zip file [VirusTotal] contains digitally signed files from the legitimate IObit License Manager program, but with the](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/2138091055ad48988e5b94a6ca95663ef715dbd36893e59d71269318bcf7aeb5/detection)\nIObitUnlocker.dll replaced with an unsigned malicious version shown below.\n\n**Malicious IObitUnlocker.dll**\n\n**DLL**\n\nSource: BleepingComputer\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen IObit License Manager.exe is executed, the malicious IObitUnlocker.dll will be executed to install the DeroHE ransomware\n[to C:\\Program Files (x86)\\IObit\\iobit.dll [VirusTotal]and execute it.](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/976af19ce19cd9dc4ff6fd7cb580c16fac25c046ad9fd529bf50451db6032727/detection)\n\nAs most executables are signed with IOBit's certificate, and the zip file was hosted on their site, users installed the\nransomware thinking it was a legitimate promotion.\n\n[Based on reports at IObit's forum and other forums [1,](https://malwaretips.com/threads/iobit-forum-hacked.106312/) [2], this is a widespread attack that targeted all forum members.](https://www.wilderssecurity.com/threads/iobit-forums-hacked.435960/)\n\n## A closer look at the DeroHE ransomware\n\nBleepingComputer has since analyzed the ransomware to illustrate what happens when executed on a victim's computer.\n\nWhen first started, the ransomware will add a Windows autorun named \"IObit License Manager\" that launches the \"rundll32\n\"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\IObit\\iobit.dll\",DllEntry\" command when logging in to Windows.\n\nEmsisoft analyst [Elise van Dorp, who also analyzed the ransomware, stated the ransomware adds the following Windows](https://twitter.com/themalwarequeen)\nDefender exclusions to allow the DLL to run.\n```\n@WMIC /Namespace:\\\\root\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Defender class MSFT_MpPreference call Add ExclusionPath=\\\"\n@WMIC /Namespace:\\\\root\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Defender class MSFT_MpPreference call Add ExclusionPath=\\\"\\Temp\\\\\"\n@WMIC /Namespace:\\\\root\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Defender class MSFT_MpPreference call Add ExclusionExtension=\\\".dll\\\"\n@WMIC /Namespace:\\\\root\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Defender class MSFT_MpPreference call Add ExclusionProcess=\\\"rundll32.exe\\\"\n\n```\nThe ransomware will now display a message box claiming to be from IObit License Manager stating, \"Please wait. It may take a\nlittle longer than expected. Keep your computer running or screen on!' The ransomware shows this alert to prevent victims from\nshutting off their devices before the ransomware finishes.\n\n**Fake alert to not turn off the computer**\n\nSource: BleepingComputer\nWhen encrypting victims, it will append the .DeroHE extension to encrypted files.\n\n**Files encrypted by the**\n\n**DeroHE ransomware**\n\n\n-----\n\nSource: BleepingComputer\nEach encrypted file will also have a string of information appended to the end of the file, as shown below. The ransomware may\nuse this information to decrypt files if a ransom is paid.\n```\n{\"version\":\"3\",\"id\":\"dERiqiUutvp35oSUfRSTCXL53TRakECSGQVQ2hhUjuCEjC6zSNFZsRqavVVSdyEzaViULtCRPxzRwRCKZ2j2ugCg5r9SrERKe7\n[{\"size\":193536,\"esize\":193564,\"offset\":0,\"rm\":\"Phj8vfOREkYPKA9e9qke1EIYOGGciqkQBSzfzg==\"}],\"ext\":\".png\"}\n\n```\n**Hex edit of an encrypted file**\n\nSource: BleepingComputer\nOn the Windows desktop, the DeroHE ransomware will create two files named FILES_ENCRYPTED.html, containing a list of all\nencrypted files, and the READ_TO_DECRYPT.html ransom note.\n\nThe ransom note has the title of 'Dero Homomorphic Encryption,' and promotes a cryptocurrency called DERO. This note tells\nthe victim to send 200 coins, worth approximately $100, to the listed address to get a decryptor.\n\n\n-----\n\n**DeroHE ransomware ransom note**\n\nSource: BleepingComputer\nEnclosed in the ransom note is the ransomware's Tor\nsite http://deropayysnkrl5xu7ic5fdprz5ixgdwy6ikxe2g3mh2erikudscrkpqd.onion, which can be used to make the payment.\n\nOf particular interest, the Tor site states that IObit can send $100,000 in DERO coins to decrypt all victims, as the attackers\nblame IObit for the compromise.\n\n\"Tell iobit.com to send us 100000 (1 hundred thousand) DERO coin to this address.\ndERopYDgpD235oSUfRSTCXL53TRakECSGQVQ2hhUjuCEjC6zSNFZsRqavVVSdyEzaViULtCRPxzRwRCKZ2j2ugCg26hRtLziwu\"\n\n\"After payment arrive, all encrypted computer (including yours) will be decrypted.

Your browser will begin to receive desktop notifications promoting adult\nsites, malicious software, and other unwanted content when subscribed.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Compromised IObit forum page**\n\nSource: BleepingComputer\nFurthermore, if you click anywhere on the page, a new tab will open showing advertisements for adult sites. Other site sections\nalso appear to be compromised as clicking on forum links redirect you to similar adult pages.\n\nAttackers compromised the forum by injecting a malicious script on all pages that are not found, as shown below.\n\n**Compromised IObit forum page**\n\nSource: BleepingComputer\nBleepingComputer has reached out to IObit with questions related to this attack but has not heard back.\n\n**_[Updated 01/19/20: A security researcher known as Ronny told BleepingComputer IOBit is using vBulletin 5.6.1 for their forum](https://twitter.com/RonnyTNL)_**\nsoftware.\n\n[This version of vBulletin has a known vulnerabily that allows remote attackers to gain control over the forum.](https://www.acunetix.com/vulnerabilities/web/vbulletin-5-6-1-nodeid-sql-injection/)\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[US Senate: Govt’s ransomware fight hindered by limited reporting](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-senate-govt-s-ransomware-fight-hindered-by-limited-reporting/)\n\n[Costa Rica declares national emergency after Conti ransomware attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/costa-rica-declares-national-emergency-after-conti-ransomware-attacks/)\n\n[New Black Basta ransomware springs into action with a dozen breaches](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-black-basta-ransomware-springs-into-action-with-a-dozen-breaches/)\n\n[American Dental Association hit by new Black Basta ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/american-dental-association-hit-by-new-black-basta-ransomware/)\n\n[Wind turbine firm Nordex hit by Conti ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/wind-turbine-firm-nordex-hit-by-conti-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[CryptoCurrency](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/cryptocurrency/)\n[Cyberattack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/cyberattack/)\n[Dero](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/dero/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[DeroHE](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/derohe/)\n[Forum](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/forum/)\n[Iobit](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/iobit/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.

We'll have to wait for an official word from iObit but using the Way Back Machine it shows\ntheir forum was using vBulletin 5.6.1 as of 01/12/2021 and the latest version from vBulletin is 5.6.4 back in Oct, 2020 which would appear to be 3 versions newer.\n\nAgain, I do not know if this is the reason. Only bringing it up in case someone else is running outdated vBulletin software\nyou should update it ASAP.\n\n[Lawrence Abrams - 1 year ago](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nYes, they are using an outdated version of vBulletin.
