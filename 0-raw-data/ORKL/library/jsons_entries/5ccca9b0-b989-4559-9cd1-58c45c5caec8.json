    "plain_text": "# Encrypted Chat Apps Doubling as Illegal Marketplaces\n\n**[nortonlifelock.com/blogs/research-group/chat-apps-illegal-marketplaces](https://www.nortonlifelock.com/blogs/research-group/chat-apps-illegal-marketplaces)**\n\n## Encrypted chat apps are gaining popularity worldwide due to their central premise of not sending user data to tech giants.\n\nSome popular examples include WhatsApp, Telegram and Signal. These apps have also\nbeen adopted by businesses to securely communicate directly to their users. Additionally,\nthese apps have been instrumental to subverting authoritarian regimes. For example,\n[Telegram has been used by pro-democracy dissidents to organize protests in Hong Kong,](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hongkong-telegram-exclusive/exclusive-messaging-app-telegram-moves-to-protect-identity-of-hong-kong-protesters-idUSKCN1VK2NI)\n[and communicate amongst themselves in Russia,](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/30/world/europe/russia-telegram-digital-resistance.html) [Belarus,](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/01/telegram-belarus-protesters-pressure-lukashenko) [Thailand, and](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-54598956) [Iran.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/iranians-turn-to-telegram-app-amid-protests-1514919114)\n\nHowever, we’ve found that encrypted chat apps are also being used by criminals to sell\n[illegal goods. Because content moderation is, by design, nearly impossible on these apps[1],](http://10.10.0.46/blogs/norton-labs/chat-apps-illegal-marketplaces#_ftn1)\nthey allow for an easy vector for dealers of illicit goods to communicate directly to customers\nwithout fear of law enforcement involvement. One example of this is Telegram, which\nprovides especially strong anonymity protections, which are useful for dissidents, but can\nalso be leveraged by criminals attempting to obscure their identities.\n\nIn our analysis, we found a wide variety of illegal goods are being sold on Telegram,\nincluding people’s personally identifiable information (PII), likely stolen gift cards, fake\ndocuments, pirated software, and tools to facilitate cybercrime such as distributed denial-of\n\n-----\n\nservice (DDoS) infrastructure. In recent months, we have also found several accounts\ndedicated to selling “COVID-19 vaccines,” targeting users in a variety of countries including\nthe United States, China, India, Malaysia, and Russia.\n\nCybercriminals sell illegal goods for a variety of reasons. Sometimes, the goods are fake or\ncounterfeit, leading to easy profits. In other cases, cybercriminals are trying to launder credit\ncards, or stolen gift cards, into money they can use.\n\n## Counterfeit Goods\n\nCounterfeit goods are a popular product on Telegram. We found many accounts and groups\ndedicated to selling a wide variety of counterfeit goods, including luxury watches and purses,\ndesigner clothes, and high-end electronics. For example, you can find a counterfeit Rolex for\nas little as $69 USD.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n## COVID-19 Vaccines\n\n\n-----\n\nIn recent months, with people anxious to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, criminals have\nattempted to take advantage of this stress by selling what they claim are COVID-19\nvaccines.\n\n## Gift Cards\n\nCybercriminals often launder ill-gotten gains such as stolen credit cards through the\npurchase and sale of gift cards. Other times, the gift cards are stolen directly through either a\npassword leak or via vulnerabilities in the gift card provider’s website. Those gift cards are\nthen sold at heavily discounted prices.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Fake Documents and Personal Information\n\nAnother popular genre of illicit goods on Telegram are fake documents and personal\ninformation. Fueled by major data breaches such as the one at Experian, data brokers have\namassed a shocking amount of personal information including social security numbers,\naddresses, phone number, bank account numbers, and more.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nSome accounts even strategically market their items for sale to coincide with newsworthy\nevents. We found a vendor offering hacked GameStop accounts around the time of that\nGameStop stock’s growth drew worldwide attention.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Tools to Facilitate Cyber-Crime\n\nInterestingly, we observed that cybercriminals are also selling a variety of tools and services,\n[including rental of DDoS infrastructure. We also found accounts marketing cheats for a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack)\nvariety of games, and services marketing themselves for users in India, Europe, Russia, the\nArab world, and North America.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n## Summary\n\nScammers, fraudsters and hucksters of illegal goods are usually ahead of the curve on the\nlatest technologies to provide a good experience for their customers. Therefore, we often see\nthese actors as early adopters of popular technologies (cybercriminals were also among the\nfirst to adopt cryptocurrencies such as BitCoin and Ethereum, which are now widely used by\nthe general public for entirely legal purposes). This case is no different, and our research\nsuggests that in the future, legitimate merchants may also adopt messaging apps and the\npeer-to-peer selling model they allow, similar to Telegram’s.\n\nInnovations from Norton Labs are for research, evaluation, and consumer feedback purposes.
