On Tuesday 2021-01-12, criminals started sending malicious spam (malspam) pushing\nHancitor again. Some people have already tweeted about this year's first wave of Hancitor. See the links below.\n\n[Today's diary reviews recent Hancitor activity from Tuesday 2021-01-12, where we also saw Cobalt Strike after the](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.cobalt_strike)\ninitial infection.\n\n_Shown above: Flow chart for recent Hancitor infection activity._\n\n**_The malspam_**\n\nOn Tuesday 2021-01-12, malspam spreading used the same fake DocuSign template we saw several times last\nyear. These emails have a link to a Google Docs page.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Shown above: Screenshot from one of the emails distributing Hancitor on Tuesday 2021-01-12._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Shown above: Link from the email redirects to a page that can generate a Word document for Hancitor._\n\n_Shown above: Word document with macros for Hancitor._\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Infection traffic_**\n\nAs you might expect, traffic to the Google Docs page and clicking on the link generates a great deal of related web\nactivity, mostly HTTPS traffic. Shortly after the Word document is sent, we find indicators of Hancitor and Cobalt\nStrike malware. I've always seen Cobalt Strike when I test Hancitor in an Active Directory (AD) environment. if\nyou're investigating an actual Hancitor infection, be aware that it will likely send Cobalt Strike if the victim host is\nsigned into an work environment that uses AD.\n\n_Shown above: Traffic caused by the Google Docs page before the infection filtered in Wireshark._\n\n_Shown above: Hancitor and Cobalt Strike traffic within an AD environment._\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)_**\n\nThe following are indicators associated with Hancitor infections from Tuesday 2021-01-12.\n\nDate/time of the six messages:\n\nTue, 12 Jan 2021 15:06:25 +0000 (UTC)\nTue, 12 Jan 2021 16:06:06 +0000 (UTC)\nTue, 12 Jan 2021 16:41:01 +0000 (UTC)\nTue, 12 Jan 2021 16:48:35 +0000 (UTC)\nTue, 12 Jan 2021 17:09:10 +0000 (UTC)\nTue, 12 Jan 2021 18:06:56 +0000 (UTC)\n\nIP addresses the malspam was received from:\n\nReceived: from digital-negative.com ([179.154.63.198])\nReceived: from digital-negative.com ([74.85.247.234])\nReceived: from digital-negative.com ([181.137.227.228])\nReceived: from digital-negative.com ([104.161.24.86])\nReceived: from digital-negative.com ([23.236.75.32])\nReceived: from digital-negative.com ([112.15.74.137])\n\nSpoofed sending addresses:\n\nFrom: \"DocuSign Signature Service\" <qybacy@digital-negative.com>\nFrom: \"DocuSign Signature and Invoice\" <iqinica@digital-negative.com>\nFrom: \"DocuSign Electronic Signature and Invoice Service\" <eupanic@digital-negative.com>\nFrom: \"DocuSign Electronic Signature \" <uvizao@digital-negative.com>\nFrom: \"DocuSign Signature Service\" <nuxzoj@digital-negative.com>\nFrom: \"DocuSign Electronic Signature Service\" <zwtmicy@digital-negative.com>\n\nSubject lines:\n\nSubject: You received notification from DocuSign Electronic Service\nSubject: You received notification from DocuSign Service\nSubject: You got notification from DocuSign Electronic Signature Service\nSubject: You got invoice from DocuSign Electronic Signature Service\nSubject: You got notification from DocuSign Service\nSubject: You received notification from DocuSign Electronic Signature Service\n\nLinks from the malspam:\n\nhxxps://docs.google[.]com/document/d/e/2PACX1vSEfjWipv61XyrbNDn1neBUGeHzEPM35pYN5QRYrpUy4X-sbHybYEZ7b6Zf8yGyA_1e4wNj452FD_O/pub\nhxxps://docs.google[.]com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTiMxxKYdtOy98JFAiBaNe1W-VVdRGcZOZurDYA1jhcatmcbcA8Uw7m_v4BvJ-H3o9m7ML_TtRNPQP/pub\nhxxps://docs.google[.]com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vShuUk4DvIVthVxqc8UIUgZ7hOQzBQ1Dop8sXP73qBfSJrlSrdIaZslExSyrr459kvaMmWbOAUkYii/pub\nhxxps://docs.google[.]com/document/d/e/2PACX1vRQ8skYzE8fzy9FnmU06fNCSEBTGwdYCxE1_NyLjxTCG7uEhpFtmI_IWAtk1FFmuQyAReDSuUCdyCFs/pub\nhxxps://docs.google[.]com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vT_UMMUFR8J8IbN7rthTdttvciBU-17slZ2anuIq4A8zT4xtF9ngzzyiEjlE8HSDZQ5tWu_w6HBFMf/pub\nhxxps://docs.google[.]com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQgYON0ZqbynIRhybfOxzkN8jUzIa-DkiYpKOTxKzhFaDt2miDJBp14XJw8lMPHtU1tkIXDcwquIr-/pub\n\n\n-----\n\nURLs that returned script to create the Word docs:\n\nhxxp://savortrading[.]com/toweringly.php\nhxxps://libifield.co[.]za/figs.php\nhxxps://expertcircles[.]co[.]uk/assotiation.php\nhxxps://libifield[.]co[.]za/oilcan.php\nhxxp://3.133.244[.]105/irs.php\n\n8 examples of downloaded Word docs (read: SHA256 hash -

This diary reviewed a recent infection on a vulnerable Windows host from malspam sent on Tuesday\n2021-01-12.\n\nDecent spam filters and best security practices should help most people avoid Hancitor infections. Default security\nsettings in Windows 10 and Microsoft Office 2019 should prevent these these infections from happening.\nHowever, it's a \"cat-and-mouse\" game, with malware developers developing new ways to circumvent security\nmeasures, while vendors update their software/applications/endpoint protection to address these new\ndevelopments. And malware distribution through email is apparently cheap enough to remain profitable for the\ncriminals who use it.\n\n[A pcap of the infection traffic, some emails, and malware associated with today's diary can be found here.](https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/2021/01/12/index.html)\n\n--Brad Duncan\nbrad [at] malware-traffic-analysis.net\n\nBrad\n\n433 Posts\nISC Handler\nJan 13th 2021\n\n\n-----",
