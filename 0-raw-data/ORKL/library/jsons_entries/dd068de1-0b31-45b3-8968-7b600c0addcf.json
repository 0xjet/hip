No other trial dates have been set.\n\n**Read more about cyber crime**\n\n[Global cyber crime worth $1.5tn a year, study reveals.](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252439584/Global-cyber-crime-worth-15tn-a-year-study-reveals)\n[Cyber threat to UK business greater than ever, report reveals.](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252438612/Cyber-threat-to-UK-business-greater-than-ever-report-reveals)\n[Economic impact of cyber crime is significant and rising.](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252435439/Economic-impact-of-cyber-crime-is-significant-and-rising)\n[Malicious insiders and DDoS attacks](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/450431236/Malicious-insiders-and-DDoS-attacks-cost-UK-business-the-most) [cost UK business the most.](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/450431236/Malicious-insiders-and-DDoS-attacks-cost-UK-business-the-most)\n\n**Read more on Hackers and cybercrime prevention**\n\n\n-----\n\nIntellectual property theft operation attributed to Winnti group\n\nBy: Sebastian Klovig Skelton\n\nCase study: Why it's difficult to attribute nation-state attacks\n\nBy: Isabella Harford\n\n\n-----\n\nFin7 hacker sentenced to 5 years in prison\n\nBy: Shaun Nichols\n\nUkrainian cyber criminal gets five years in jail\n\nBy: Alex Scroxton\n\nLatest News\n\n[Broadband Forum launches app-enabled services network gateway](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252520775/Broadband-Forum-launches-app-enabled-services-network-gateway)\n[NatWest replacing multiple customer service systems](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252520758/NatWest-replacing-multiple-customer-service-systems)\n[Amazon shareholders vote down audit of warehouse work conditions](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252520759/Amazon-shareholders-vote-down-audit-of-warehouse-work-conditions)\n[View All News](https://www.computerweekly.com/news)\n\n\n-----\n\nDownload Computer Weekly\n\nIn The Current Issue:\n\nGartner: It’s time to ‘unleash innovation’\nPrepare for a smart robot revolution\nDigitising customer engagement\n[Download Current Issue](https://www.computerweekly.com/ezine/Computer-Weekly/Set-innovation-free-and-make-great-ideas-a-reality)\n\n\n-----",
