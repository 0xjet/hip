Nothing could be further from the truth\n\n**[welivesecurity.com/2020/07/14/welcome-chat-secure-messaging-app-nothing-further-truth/](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/07/14/welcome-chat-secure-messaging-app-nothing-further-truth/)**\n\nJuly 14, 2020\n\nESET research uncovers a malicious operation that both spies on victims and leaks their\ndata\n\n[Lukas Stefanko](https://www.welivesecurity.com/author/lstefanko/)\n14 Jul 2020 - 11:30AM\n\n\n-----\n\nESET research uncovers a malicious operation that both spies on victims and leaks their\ndata\n\nWe discovered a new operation within a long-running cyber-espionage campaign in the\nMiddle East. Targeting Android users via the malicious Welcome Chat app, the operation\n[appears to have links to the malware named BadPatch, which MITRE links to the Gaza](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0337/)\n[Hackers threat actor group known also as Molerats.](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/actor/molerats)\n\nOur analysis shows that the Welcome Chat app allows spying upon its victims. However, it\nis not simple spyware. Welcome Chat is a functioning chat app that delivers the promised\nfunctionality along with its hidden espionage capacity.\n\nWe found this spyware being advertised to chat-hungry users (these apps are banned in\nsome countries in the Middle East region) on a dedicated website (see Figure 1). The fact\nthat the website is in Arabic conforms with the targeting of the whole campaign we believe\n[this operation belongs to. The domain was registered in October 2019; we couldn’t,](https://www.whois.com/whois/ephoneservices.club)\nhowever, determine when the website was launched.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1. The website of the malicious Welcome Chat app_\n\nThe malicious website promotes the Welcome Chat app, claiming it’s a secure chat platform\nthat is available on the Google Play store. Both claims are false. In regard to the “secure”\nclaim, nothing is further from the truth. Not only is Welcome Chat an espionage tool; on top\nof that, its operators left the data harvested from their victims freely available on the\ninternet. And the app was never available on the official Android app store.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2. Despite the caption stating “High quality, secure and available on Google Play”, the button_\n\n_leads to the installation file being downloaded directly from the malicious website_\n\n## Functionality/Analysis\n\nOnce the user downloads the app, it needs the setting “Allow installing apps from unknown\nsources” to be activated since the app was not downloaded from the Play Store.\n\nAfter installation, the malicious app will request the victim to allow permissions such as\nsend and view SMS messages, access files, record audio, and access contacts and device\nlocation. Such an extensive list of intrusive permissions might normally make the victims\nsuspicious – but with a messaging app, it’s natural they are needed for the app to deliver\nthe promised functionality.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3. Permission requests by Welcome Chat spyware_\n\nIn order to be able to communicate with other users of this app, the user needs to register\nand create a personal account (see Figure 4).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4. The Sign up/Login dialog of the Welcome Chat app_\n\nImmediately after receiving these permissions, Welcome Chat sends information about the\ndevice to its Command and Control (C&C) server and is ready to receive commands. It is\ndesigned to contact the C&C server every five minutes.\n\nOn top of its core espionage functionality – monitoring the chat communications of its users\n– the Welcome Chat app can perform the following malicious actions: exfiltrating sent and\nreceived SMS messages, call log history, contact list, user photos, recorded phone calls,\nthe GPS location of the device, and device info.\n\n## Trojanized or attacker-developed chat app?\n\nAn interesting question arises with functional trojan apps: is the app an attacker-trojanized\nversion of a clean app, or did the attackers develop a malicious app from scratch?\n\nIn both cases, it is easy for the attackers to spy on exchanged in-app messages as they\nwould – naturally – have the authorization keys to the user database.\n\nDespite the first option being typical for trojanized apps, we believe that in this particular\ncase, the second explanation is more probable.\n\nTypically, trojanized apps are created via a process of appending the malicious functionality\nto a legitimate app. The bad guys find and download a suitable app. After decompiling it,\nthey add the malicious functionality and recompile the now-malicious-yet-still-functioning\napp to spread it among their desired audience.\n\n\n-----\n\nThere is a major question mark with this option: to this day, we have not been able to\ndiscover any clean version of the Welcome Chat app. Not only can it not be found on any of\nthe Android markets we have on our radar; based on the binary matching algorithms in our\nsample classification systems, we haven’t found any clean app with this same chat\nfunctionality. Of interest in this regard is that a clean version of Welcome Chat, without the\nespionage functionality, was uploaded to VirusTotal in mid-February 2020 (hash:\n757bd41d5fa99e19200cee59a3fd1577741ccd82). The malicious version was first submitted\nto VirusTotal a week earlier.\n\nThis leads us to believe that the attackers developed the malicious chat app on their own.\nCreating a chat app for Android is not difficult; there are many detailed tutorials on the\ninternet. With this approach, the attackers have better control over the compatibility of the\napp’s malicious functionality with its legitimate functions, so they can ensure that the chat\napp will work.\n\n## Code analysis\n\nThe Welcome Chat espionage app seems to have targeted Arabic-speaking users: both the\ndefault website language and default in-app language are Arabic. However, based on\ndebug logs left in the code, strings, class and unique variable names, we were able to\ndetermine that most of the malicious code was copied from publicly available open source\ncode projects and code example snippets available on public forums.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5. The developer used different pieces of open source code to create the malicious app_\n\nIn some cases, the copied open source code is quite old – see Table 1. As a possible\nexplanation, all the listed examples come at the very top among the results of simple\ngoogling for the respective functionalities.\n\n_Table 1. The origins of the malicious code_\n\n**Functionality** **Source** **Age (years)**\n\nCall recording [open source, GitHub](https://github.com/hunterli/callrec/tree/master/src/com/cn6000/callrec) 8\n\nSMS stealing [open source, GitHub](https://github.com/tuenti/SmsRadar/tree/master/library/src/main/java/com/tuenti/smsradar) 6\n\nGoogle Maps coordinates [open source, Blogspot (plus other sources)](https://msql-php.blogspot.com/2015/11/google-map-v3-get-city-state-zipcode.html) 5\n\nGEO tracking [open source, GitHub](https://github.com/Artsu/GeoTrack/tree/master/src/fi/jyu/ties425/geotrack/util) 8\n\n\n-----\n\n**Functionality** **Source** **Age (years)**\n\nGPS tracking [open source, GitHub](https://gist.github.com/ertugrulozcan/70973144b1c582618a6c) 5\n\n## User data leak\n\nThe Welcome Chat app, including its infrastructure, was not built with security in mind. The\napp uploads all of the user’s stolen data to the attacker-controlled server via unsecured\nHTTP.\n\nTransmitted data is not encrypted and because of that, not only it is available to the\nattacker, it is freely accessible to anyone on the same network.\n\nThe database contains data such as name, email, phone number, device token, profile\npicture, messages and friends list – in fact, all the users’ data except for the account\npasswords can be found uploaded to the unsecured server.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6. The victim’s device uploads the user data to the app’s server_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7. User database leak_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8. Leaked user info_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 9. An example of an in-app message being freely accessible on the app’s unsecured server_\n\nOnce we discovered the sensitive information as being publicly accessible, we intensified\nour efforts to discover the developer of the legitimate chat app (i.e., the app the espionage\ntool was – eventually – a trojanized version of) to disclose the vulnerability to them. We\nfound neither the developer nor the app, convincing us that the app was built from the\nbeginning as malicious. Naturally, we made no effort to reach out to the malicious actors\nbehind the app.\n\n## Possible BadPatch connection\n\nThe Welcome Chat espionage app belongs to the very same Android malware family that\nwe identified at the beginning of 2018. That malware used the same C&C server, pal4u.net,\nas the espionage campaign targeting the Middle East that was identified in late 2017 by\n\n\n-----\n\n[Palo Alto Networks and named BadPatch. In late 2019, Fortinet described yet another](https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/badpatch-campaign-uses-python-malware.html)\nespionage operation focused on Palestinian targets with the domain pal4u.net among its\nindicators of compromise.\n\nFor these reasons we believe that this campaign with new Android trojans comes from the\nthreat actors behind the long-term BadPatch campaign.\n\n## Recommendation\n\nWhile the Welcome Chat-based espionage operation seems to be narrowly targeted, we\nstrongly recommend that users don’t install any apps from outside the official Google Play\nstore – unless it’s a trusted source such as a website of an established security vendor or\nsome reputable financial institution. On top of that, users should pay attention to what\npermissions their apps require and be suspicious of any apps that require permissions\nbeyond their functionality – and, as a very basic security measure, run a reputable security\napp on their mobile devices.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)\n\n**Hash** **ESET detection name**\n\nC60D7134B05B34AF08023155EAB3B38CEDE4BCCD Android/Spy.Agent.ALY\n\nC755D37D6692C650692F4C637AE83EF6BB9577FC Android/Spy.Agent.ALY\n\n89AB73D4AAF41CBCDBD0C8C7D6D85D21D93ED199 Android/Spy.Agent.ALY\n\n2905F2F60D57FBF13D25828EF635CA1CCE81E757 Android/Spy.Agent.ALY\n\n**C&C: emobileservices.club**\n\n## MITRE ATT&CK techniques\n\n**Tactic** **ID** **Name** **Description**\n\n\nInitial\nAccess\n\n\n[T1444](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1444/) Masquerade as\nLegitimate\nApplication\n\n\nWelcome Chat impersonates a legitimate chat\napplication.\n\nWelcome Chat listens for the\nBOOT_COMPLETED broadcast, ensuring that\nthe app's functionality will be activated every\ntime the device starts.\n\n\nPersistence [T1402](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1402/) App Auto-Start\nat Device Boot\n\n\n-----\n\n**Tactic** **ID** **Name** **Description**\n\n\nDiscovery [T1426](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1426/) System\nInformation\nDiscovery\n\nCollection [T1412](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1412/) Capture SMS\nMessages\n\n\n[T1430](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1430/) Location\nTracking\n\n[T1433](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1433/) Access\nCall Log\n\n[T1432](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1432/) Access\nContact\nList\n\n[T1429](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1429/) Capture\nAudio\n\n[T1533](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1533/) Data\nfrom\nLocal\nSystem\n\n\nWelcome Chat\nspies on the\ndevice's\nlocation.\n\nWelcome Chat\nexfiltrates call\nlog history.\n\nWelcome Chat\nexfiltrates the\nuser contact\nlist.\n\nWelcome Chat\nrecords\nsurrounding\naudio.\n\nWelcome Chat\nsteals user\nphotos stored\non device.\n\n\nWelcome Chat collects information about the\ndevice.\n\nWelcome Chat exfiltrates sent and received\nSMS messages.\n\nWelcome Chat uploads exfiltrated data using\nthe HTTP protocol.\n\n\nCommand\nand Control\n\n\n[T1437](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1437/) Standard\nApplication\nLayer Protocol\n\n\n14 Jul 2020 - 11:30AM\n\n### Sign up to receive an email update whenever a new article is published in our Ukraine Crisis – Digital Security Resource Center\n\n Newsletter\n\n\n-----\n\n### Discussion\n\n\n-----",
