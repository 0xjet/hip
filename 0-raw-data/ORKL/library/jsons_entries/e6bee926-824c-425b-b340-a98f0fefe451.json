These funds allegedly represent the proceeds\nof a May 8, ransom payment to individuals in a group known as DarkSide, which had\ntargeted Colonial Pipeline, resulting in critical infrastructure being taken out of operation. The\nseizure warrant was authorized earlier today by the Honorable Laurel Beeler, U.S. Magistrate\nJudge for the Northern District of California.\n\n“Following the money remains one of the most basic, yet powerful tools we have,” said\nDeputy Attorney General Lisa O. Monaco for the U.S. Department of Justice. “Ransom\npayments are the fuel that propels the digital extortion engine, and today’s announcement\ndemonstrates that the United States will use all available tools to make these attacks more\ncostly and less profitable for criminal enterprises. We will continue to target the entire\nransomware ecosystem to disrupt and deter these attacks. Today’s announcements also\ndemonstrate the value of early notification to law enforcement; we thank Colonial Pipeline for\nquickly notifying the FBI when they learned that they were targeted by DarkSide.”\n\n\n-----\n\nThere is no place beyond the reach of the FBI to conceal illicit funds that will prevent us\nfrom imposing risk and consequences upon malicious cyber actors,” said FBI Deputy\nDirector Paul Abbate. “We will continue to use all of our available resources and leverage our\ndomestic and international partnerships to disrupt ransomware attacks and protect our\nprivate sector partners and the American public.”\n\n“Cyber criminals are employing ever more elaborate schemes to convert technology into\ntools of digital extortion,” said Acting U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California\nStephanie Hinds. “We need to continue improving the cyber resiliency of our critical\ninfrastructure across the nation, including in the Northern District of California. We will also\ncontinue developing advanced methods to improve our ability to track and recover digital\nransom payments.”\n\nOn or about May 7, Colonial Pipeline was the victim of a highly publicized ransomware attack\nresulting in the company taking portions of its infrastructure out of operation. Colonial\nPipeline reported to the FBI that its computer network was accessed by an organization\nnamed DarkSide and that it had received and paid a ransom demand for approximately 75\nbitcoins.\n\nAs alleged in the supporting affidavit, by reviewing the Bitcoin public ledger, law enforcement\nwas able to track multiple transfers of bitcoin and identify that approximately 63.7 bitcoins,\nrepresenting the proceeds of the victim’s ransom payment, had been transferred to a specific\naddress, for which the FBI has the “private key,” or the rough equivalent of a password\nneeded to access assets accessible from the specific Bitcoin address. This bitcoin\nrepresents proceeds traceable to a computer intrusion and property involved in money\nlaundering and may be seized pursuant to criminal and civil forfeiture statutes.\n\nThe Special Prosecutions Section and Asset Forfeiture Unit of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for\nthe Northern District of California is handling the seizure, with significant assistance from the\nDepartment of Justice Criminal Division’s Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section\nand Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section, and the National Security Division’s\nCounterintelligence and Export Control Section. The Department components who worked\non this seizure coordinated their efforts through the Department’s Ransomware and Digital\nExtortion Task Force, which was created to combat the growing number of ransomware and\ndigital extortion attacks.\n\nThe Task Force prioritizes the disruption, investigation, and prosecution of ransomware and\ndigital extortion activity by tracking and dismantling the development and deployment of\nmalware, identifying the cybercriminals responsible, and holding those individuals\naccountable for their crimes. The Task Force also strategically targets the ransomware\ncriminal ecosystem as a whole and collaborates with domestic and foreign government\nagencies as well as private sector partners to combat this significant criminal threat.\n\n\n-----",
