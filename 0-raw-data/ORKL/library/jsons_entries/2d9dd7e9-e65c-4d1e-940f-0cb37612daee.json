    "plain_text": "# A LockerGoga primer and decrypters for Mira and Aurora ransomwares\n\n**[helpnetsecurity.com/2019/04/02/aurora-decrypter-mira-decrypter/](https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2019/04/02/aurora-decrypter-mira-decrypter/)**\n\nApril 2, 2019\n\nThere’s some good news for victims of the Mira and Aurora ransomwares: free decrypters\nhave been made available.\n\n\n-----\n\n## New decrypters\n\nF-Secure has released a decrypter for victims of the Mira ransomware. (You’ll known you’ve\nbeen hit if the encrypted files sport the .mira extension.)\n\n“Most often, decryption can be very challenging because of missing keys that are needed for\ndecryption. However, in the case of Mira ransomware, it appends all information required to\ndecrypt an encrypted file into the encrypted file itself,” the company explained.\n\n[The tool can be found here, and instructions on how to use it here.](https://download.f-secure.com/support/tools/Mira-decryptor/Mira%20Ransomware%20Decryptor.zip)\n\nBefore running the tool, users need to remove the ransomware from the computer, lest it\nencrypt the decrypted files again.\n\n“It is important to run the tool on the specific computer where the files were originally\nencrypted. This is because the recovery key for each files are calculated from the computer\nwhere the files got encrypted,” the company added.\n\nEmsisoft has released a decrypter for victims of the Aurora ransomware, aka Zorro, Desu,\nor AnimusLocker. (You’ll known you’ve been hit if the encrypted files sport the .Aurora,\n_.aurora, .animus, .ONI, .Nano, .desu or .cryptoid extension.)_\n\n\n-----\n\n[By the by, Michael Gillespie, security researcher and the creator of ID Ransomware, the](https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2016/04/12/id-ransomware/)\nonline tool that ransomware victims can use to identify the specific malware they’ve been hit\nwith, [has also released a decrypter for the Aurora ransomware earlier this year.](https://download.bleepingcomputer.com/demonslay335/AuroraDecrypter.zip)\n\n## About LockerGoga\n\nUnlike Mira and Aurora, the LockerGoga ransomware seems to have been flinged at\nspecific, high-profile targets.\n\n[The name became widely known after the recent Norsk Hydro attack. The company did not](https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2019/03/20/norsk-hydro-cyber-attack/)\nname the ransomware that hit them, but the Norwegian National Security Authority confirmed\nit is LockerGoga.\n\nThe Center for Internet Security has released a primer containing the most current\ninformation about the ransomware and known indicators of compromise.\n\n“LockerGoga reportedly targets other sectors, although a disproportionate amount of victims\n[reside in the industrial/manufacturing sector,” the organization pointed out. Known recent](https://www.cisecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/LockerGoga-Security-Primer.pdf)\nvictims include French engineering consulting firm Altran and U.S. chemical companies\nHexion and MPM Holdings (Momentive).\n\nAt this time, the initial intrusion vector is unknown, they say, but it seems that the\nransomware is unable to spread itself to other computers on the network.\n\nThey also pointed out that, in some cases, the victims won’t even be able to tell they’ve been\ntargeted with this specific malware.\n\n“Cisco’s Talos group observed that some LockerGoga variants forcibly log victims off their\ndevices. They are then unable to log back onto the device, which also means they may not\nsee the ransom note. Furthermore, in some cases the network interface on each system was\ndisabled and the local user account passwords were changed. This can cause confusion on\nthe victim’s end as to their issue’s root cause,” they noted.\n\n“If this is an intentional feature, then it is possible that the CTAs have both financial and\ndestructive motivations.”\n\nTheir advice for organizations is to make regular backups of their important files and make\nsure that they are able to recover from them.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----",
