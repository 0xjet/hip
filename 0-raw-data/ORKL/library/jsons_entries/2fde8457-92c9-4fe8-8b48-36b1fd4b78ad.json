The gang, first seen in May 2019, is behind high-dollar enterprise ransomware attacks. Unfortunately, the arrests had little impact, and several weeks later, in March 2021, Twisted Spider operations continued. Twisted Spider often makes headlines, but it’s not only due to their attacks. In June 2020, the gang issued a press release, claiming they joined forces with several other well-known ransomware attackers to create a criminal cartel. If this is true, this collaborative partnership, sharing resources and revenue, would pose a far greater threat to the community than attacks from smaller individual gangs by themselves.\n\n Analyst1 produced this report to address whether or not the Cartel actually exists, as well as to help analysts better understand and defend against advanced ransomware attackers. We conduct research and analysis to address the following goals:\n\n • Research and provide an analytical assessment to determine if the Cartel is real or a fabrication created to distract law enforcement and researchers.\n\n • Profile and assess each gang within the Cartel and determine their relationships with one another.\n\n • Identify the steps behind how each attacker breaches and extorts their victims. Understanding the attacker’s behavior and tactics will assist in formulating better defensive and mitigation processes.\n\n### Key Findings\n\n###### Analyst1 spent time digging through criminal marketplaces where Cartel gangs have a presence to research and analyze the criminal entities within the alleged Cartel. We explored the malware and tools the groups use, tracked their bitcoin transactions, and studied relevant reports from other researchers in the field alongside select media outlets.\n\n\n###### explored the malware and tools the groups use, tracked their bitcoin transactions, and studied relevant reports from other researchers in the field alongside select media outlets.\n\n Our research identified several key findings:\n\n 1. Analyst1 observed Cartel affiliated gangs distributing/posting victim data across leak websites belonging to other gangs within the Cartel. In other words, one gang\n\n\n-----\n\n###### breached and stole data from a victim and passed it to another gang to post publicly and negotiate with the victim.\n\n 2. Analyst1 observed multiple gangs within the Cartel coordinating via Cartel leak websites, including sharing tactics, command and control infrastructure, and sharing/ posting victim data.\n\n 3. Attackers are moving towards automating their attacks. Multiple gangs have added automated capabilities into their ransom payloads, allowing them to spread and infect their victims without human interaction.\n\n 4. Ransom demands continue to increase. Collectively, gangs in the Cartel generated hundreds of millions of dollars from ransomware and data extortion operations.\n\n 5. Several Cartel gangs offer Ransomware as a Service (RaaS), hiring hackers to  execute attacks while providing them with malware, infrastructure, and ransom negotiation services.\n\n 6. Attackers are becoming bolder ­— they are now conducting PR interviews with reporters, issuing press releases, and leveraging social media ads and call centers to harass and pressure victims into paying.\n\n 7. Attackers are reinvesting profits made from ransom operations to advance both tactics and malware to increase their success and revenue. Malware is updated regularly, adding new sophisticated features.\n\n 8. One gang, Wizard Spider, developed unique malware geared towards espionage. Analyst1 could not validate how Wizard Spider uses it in attacks. It’s existence  alone is troubling. We found no other gang in the Cartel that uses or develops espionage malware.\n\n We present other detailed findings and assess the overall Cartel theory in the conclusion of this report.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Cartel Overview\n\n###### Four ransomware gangs currently exist within the Cartel: Twisted Spider, Viking Spider, Wizard Spider, and the Lockbit Gang as seen in Figure 1 below.\n\n_Figure 1: Cartel breakdown_\n\n###### Note: The SunCrypt gang is no longer active, but they previously claimed allegiance to the Cartel and have since retired.\n\n The gangs who make up the Cartel originate from eastern Europe and primarily speak Russian, based on posts made to underground criminal forums. Interestingly, all of the gangs build checks and balances into their ransomware to ensure that the payload does not execute on Russian victims. Here, the malware checks if the system language matches a dialect spoken in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), which formerly made up the Soviet Union. Advanced attackers will often even purposely place false flags into their operations to lead investigators astray. However, the Cartel gangs do little to hide the fact they speak Russian, and they go out of their way not to target victims within affiliated Russian territories.\n\n### Timeline\n\n###### The Cartel emerged in May 2020; however, Twisted Spider began ransomware operations almost a year earlier, in August 2019. The group developed ransomware named Maze to use in its attacks. Twisted Spider is one of the first ransomware gangs to incorporate victim data theft and exposure to pressure victims to pay. Other ransomware gangs soon adopted the tactic, which is now widely used in big game hunting attacks. Several soon- to-be cartel affiliated organizations emerged prior to or during the year between Twisted Spider’s appearance and the Cartel’s formation. Figure 2 is a timeline of significant events leading to the Cartel’s establishment.\n\n\n###### almost a year earlier, in August 2019. The group developed ransomware named Maze to use in its attacks.

Each campaign utilized its own malware and infrastructure, primarily separate from one another.\n\n • Twisted Spider created online personas for each campaign, one using Maze and the other Egregor ransomware. The operators who make up the gang use these personas to talk to both the media and security researchers. During media interviews, they discuss their operations and relationships with other ransomware gangs.\n\n • Since its inception, the group has utilized Egregor and Maze ransomware to extort at least $75 million from private sector companies, local governments, and hospitals. We believe this figure to be much more significant, but we can only assess the publicly acknowledged ransom payments. Many victims never publicly report when they pay a ransom.\n\n • Twisted Spider uses a key (string/password) required for the Egregor payload to execute; this makes analysis difficult.\n\n • The gang uses the open-source tool RClone in conjunction with public infrastructure (FTP servers, Dropbox, etc.) to copy and exfiltrate victim data.\n\n • The gang claims to have created a cartel with other well-known ransomware gangs. However, they would later attempt to rescind this claim upon retiring their Maze operations and commencing the attacks using the Egregor payload. However, the evidence we discuss in the Cartel Assessment section of this report supports the theory that Twisted Spider and other gangs do work together. Both their retirement and backtracking on the Cartel affiliation after months of promoting it was likely an attempt to throw off researchers and law enforcement.\n\n\n###### attempt to throw off researchers and law enforcement.\n\n##### Twisted Spider Details\n\n###### Most criminals try to avoid drawing attention to themselves and their unlawful activities — but not Twisted Spider. The gang talks to the media, provide quotes for articles, and is willing to respond to security researchers. They even have a “Press” section on their data\n\n\n-----\n\n###### leak website, which they leverage to issue “Press Releases”. On more than one occasion, the gang communicated with the cybersecurity media organization Bleeping Computer.[1][,2]\n\n The first interaction took place after Twisted Spider attacked Canon, U.S.A., stealing and encrypting their data. The attack resulted in a double extortion attempt:\n\n • Extortion attempt #1: The gang held Canon’s data hostage through ransomware encryption. Only Twisted Spider had the decryption key necessary to restore the data to a usable state. If Canon did not pay the Ransom, the data would remain encrypted.\n\n • Extortion #2: Before executing the ransomware, Twisted Spider made a copy of Canon’s data, including internal communications and other information not intended for public release.\n\n To pressure Canon into paying the ransom, Twisted Spider threatened to release their data publicly. Afterward, Bleeping Computer reached out to Twisted Spider. Surprisingly enough, Twisted Spider responded to their questions. Bleeping Computer published quotes from the conversation in an article about ransomware attacks.[3] Similar interactions between the publication and Twisted Spider have continued, until the group transitioned to Egregor-based operations in the fall of 2020. Using the new ransom payload, the attacker also obtained new infrastructure for their data leak site and command and control operations. Since then, interview responses have ceased, and the new leak site did not include a “Press” page. This could have been due to the impending law enforcement investigation that led to arrests several months after Egregor operations began. In this moment, Twisted Spider may have realized that they should not be talking to reporters, and that they needed to operate with more discretion.\n\n When Twisted Spider developed Egregor, they built several upgraded capabilities into Egregor’s design. For example, the Egregor payload included an option requiring a password to execute the ransomware, unlike in Maze. The password feature provides its developer with an additional level of control. Without the correct password, the payload is rendered useless and will not run. This makes it extremely difficult to analyze and prevents its use by anyone other than Twisted Spider or their affiliates.\n\n\n###### prevents its use by anyone other than Twisted Spider or their affiliates.\n\n While researching Twisted Spider activity, Analyst1 attempted to determine how much revenue the group made through extortion. Unfortunately, while Twisted Spider frequently posts victims’ names, they do not post the ransom amount companies pay. However, according to Coveware — a ransomware mediation company — Twisted Spider demanded an average ransom of $693,333 in their operations.[4] During at least one extortion attempt, they attempted to extort 2 million dollars from Allied Universal.[5] If we\n\n\n-----\n\n###### use the average amount ($693k) and multiply that by the number of victims previously listed on their data leak sites, the group brought in over 75 million dollars. Through our research, Analyst1 found Twisted Spider ransom demands ranging from hundreds of thousands to several million per incident, which corresponds with the average ransom amount Coveware published. You may wonder why a company would pay such a large ransom, but oftentimes the cost of rebuilding after a ransom attack far outweighs the ransom itself. For example, when Twisted Spider attacked Cognizant — an I.T. services company — it cost 50 to 70 million dollars for them to rebuild their systems and restore the affected data.[6] While we never suggest paying an attacker, this example explains why some companies do still choose to pay.\n\n##### Attack Chain\n\n###### Figure 3 details the attack chain Twisted Spider uses to breach and extort victims.\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n1. Initial infection vector varies:\n  a. A phishing email delivers a malicious macro-enabled office document that\n    drops commodity malware like IcedID, Qbot, or Ursnif.\n  b. In other instances, the attacker uses Brute force tactics to exploit RDP on\n    vulnerable or misconfigured internet-facing devices.\n  c. The attacker also gains access by exploiting unpatched, vulnerable VPN\n    software.\n2. PowerShell commands are issued to download and compile CobaltStrike.\n3. CobaltStrike downloads and installs Mimikatz to collect credentials and gain\n  administrative privileges.\n4. In some instances, the hacktool SystemBC manages and executes the rest of\n  the attack. Once installed, the attacker uses the SystemBC control panel\n  to create scheduled tasks. The tasks issue scripts designed to identify and\n  collect administrative credentials necessary for privilege escalation. SystemBC\n  also provides proxy capabilities, encrypting the traffic between the victim\n  environment and the Command and Control (C&C) server.\n  A. In situations where the attacker used SystemBC credential theft scripts,\n    they did not use Mimikatz. \n5. Next, RClone is downloaded and used to copy victim data, and it is then\n  exfiltrated using attacker-provided scripts.[7] The scripts rely on FTP, WebDAV, or\n  Dropbox to facilitate the exfiltration, which eventually ends up in attacker  controlled infrastructure.\n6. Rclone is an open-source command-line tool that manages and syncs local files\n  (data) to a remote site. It is normally associated with syncing cloud data, but\n  the user can still configure any destination, which makes it useful for copying\n  victim data.\n7. The attacker uses Sharphound or AdFind to enumerate and identify vulnerable\n  components or misconfigurations of Active Directory.[8]\n  A. Sharphound is a tool that profiles Active Directory. It can discover\n    and gather detailed information about group policies, domains, users,\n    computers, and more.\n  B. Adfind is an open-source tool which queries and interacts with Active\n    Directory.\n\n```\n```\n      8. Using their new administrative privileges alongside the information they’ve\n        learned about the victim’s Active Directory domain, the attacker uses a Group\n        Policy Object to disable Windows Defender.\n      9. A batch file downloaded via CobaltStrike or SystemBC identifies and disables\n        various system and security services.\n      10. The script also issues a vssadmin command to delete shadow copies, thereby\n        preventing the victim from using recovery features to restore data.\n      11. The attacker distributes the Egregor payload throughout the environment.\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n12. In some attacks, Twisted Spider uses BitsAdmin to distribute the payload.[9]\n13. BitsAdmin is a Microsoft command-line tool that manages Windows Background\n  Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS). The service acts at the system level to\n  transfer data asynchronously. The attacker uses BitsAdmin to create jobs that\n  transfer and deliver the ransom payload via the BITS (service) to systems\n  throughout the environment.[10]\n14. Once the attacker disperses the payload across all systems, the payload\n  executes, encrypts data, and distributes the ransom note.\n15. In some attacks, the ransom note prints repeatedly from all printers within the\n  environment. In at least one attack, it printed tiny ransom notes onto receipt\n  tape from Point of Sale (PoS) systems.[11]\n\n###### Twisted Spider has encrypted victim data since its inception, but they did not incorporate data theft into their operations until May 2020. At the time, Twisted Spider was one of the few groups who used the double extortion tactic. Not only did Twisted Spider steal the data, but they also established their dedicated leak site (DLS) to “name and shame” the victim. Figure 4 below is a screenshot of posts Twisted Spider made on their website naming their victims and releasing stolen data.\n\n```\n_Figure 4: Egregor (Twisted Spider) ransomware hall of shame (data leak site)._\n\n\n###### So far, the attacker is professional even during ransom negotiations in which they directly communicate with the victims. However, perhaps their calm and professional candor is because things have gone their way up to this point. Despite Twisted Spider’s attempt to pressure the targeted organizations, not all victims paid. When initial victims did not pay, Twisted Spider calls the victim names in an online tantrum and makes further threats — much like a child who does not get their way. Figure 5 is an example of Twisted Spider issuing a press release insulting the victim.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5: Hole of the month press release!_\n\n###### Clearly, the rationale behind nominating a victim for “hole of the month” was to push for a victim to pay the ransom. Then, after being called “hole of the month”, the hurtful name-calling intensifies. Twisted Spider then deals the death blow and designates the victim as “clown of the month”. For an organized attacker who places time and care into compromising the victim in the first place, it seems odd to handle post-operation tactics and negotiations so childishly. Despite the odd turn of events after the ransom attack, Twisted Spider is still one of the most notorious and dangerous ransomware gangs  active today. \n\n##### Sekhmet Ties\n\n###### Like its predecessor, Maze, Egregor ransomware shares source code with older ransomware known as Sekhmet. In addition to this, all three variants use the Cha Cha stream cipher and the RSA 2048 encryption algorithm to encrypt victim files. Furthermore, each variant also has similar ransom notes. The developer likely created the original note that remained present across all three as a template — not due to collaboration between the gangs.\n\n\n_Figure 5: Hole of the month press release!_\n\n\n-----\n\n###### While it is unclear if Twisted Spider directly associates with the criminals behind the Sekhmet ransomware attacks, it is clear that they must have access to its source code in order to develop both Maze and Egregor malware variants. Furthermore, attacks involving all three variants also share several tactics. Here, both gangs conduct data extortion in addition to data encryption alongside hosting their websites to name and shame victims. However, these tactics were observed and publicly reported in ransomware attacks beginning in mid-2020. Since then, many enterprise ransomware attackers have adapted these tactics, making them too common to use as evidence for attribution purposes. As of March 2021, attacks involving Maze, Egregor and Sekhmet ransomware are ongoing. Analyst1 tracks the gangs behind the ransomware operation as two separate groups. Additionally, there is no evidence supporting the gang behind Sekhmet has an affiliation with the Cartel.\n\n Twisted Spider Group Facts:\n\n**•** `First known activity: September 2020`\n\n**•** `Motivation: Financial gain`\n\n**•** `Names: Twisted Spider`\n\n**•** `Historical affiliations: Twisted Spider previously used Maze ransomware with`\n```\n technical ties to Sekhmet.\n\n```\n**•** `Spoken language: Russian`\n\n**•** `DLS websites: Egreornews[.]com, newsegregor[.]top, wikiegregor[.]top,`\n```\n egregorwiki[.]top, egregor-support[.]com, egregor.top, egregorsup[.]com,\n egregoranrmzapcv.onion\n\n```\n**•** `C&C: amajai-technologies[.]industries (see Appendix for additional IOC’s)`\n\n**•** `Malware: Egregor ransomware, Maze ransomware (Retired), Qakbot,`\n```\n Commodity exploit kits\n\n```\n**•** `Ransom extension: 5 – 6 Random generated characters`\n\n**•** `Ransom note filename: RECOVER-FILES.txt (Egregor), DECRYPT-FILES.html (Maze)`\n\n\n-----\n\n# Viking Spider\n\n\n-----\n\n### Viking Spider\n\n###### Viking Spider first began ransom operations in December 2019, and they use ransomware known as Ragnar Locker to compromise and extort organizations.[12] Below are key findings identified while researching Viking Spider activity.\n\n • Viking Spider is the first ransomware attacker to install their own virtual machine (VM) into victim environments. They use this VM to evade detection, and they also use it as a launch point to execute the attack.\n\n • The gang is the first to use Facebook ads to pressure victims into paying the ransom.\n\n • Viking Spider outsources call centers in India to contact victims asking them to pay the ransom or risk data exposure.\n\n • Viking Spider uses Managed Service Provider (MSP) software to deliver malware and hacktools as well as provide remote access into victim environments.\n\n • Viking Spider is one of the few gangs who conduct DDoS attacks alongside ransom attacks to pressure victims to pay. Another Cartel gang first used this tactic, but Viking Spider quickly adopted it for their uses as well.\n\n • Viking Spider uses social media such as Twitter to shame non-paying victims publicly.\n\n##### Viking Spider Details\n\n###### Viking Spider is the most innovative gang within the ransom Cartel. For instance, the group was the first to use remote MSP software — such as ConnctWise and Kaseya — to gain remote access into target environments.[13] The legitimate use of the tool allows for the MSP to manage their client’s environment. During this time, the MSP can take inventory of endpoint systems, upload and download files, remotely access systems, and even more. Here, Viking Spider leveraged its capabilities to deliver malware and tools into the victim environment.\n\n\n###### Of course, Viking Spider introduced more novel tactics than simply the use of MSP remote management software. They also used the management software to download a Microsoft installer (MSI) instance of Oracle VirtualBox, a Windows XP virtual machine (VM), and the Ragnar Locker payload.[14] Once up and running, Viking Spider manages the attack from within the VM. No endpoint or antivirus protection runs on the virtual machine; this allows the attacker to hide their malware and hacktools. The attacker uses the Windows XP operating system, given that it does not utilize Windows Defender\n\n\n-----\n\n###### or other security resources included in current Windows operating systems. Now, the attacker has a hidden enclave within the target’s infrastructure wherein they can safely manage and execute the rest of the attack. We detail the attacker’s step-by-step process in the Viking Spider Attack Chain later in this report.\n\n Viking Spider’s creativity did not stop here though. Upon completing the ransom and data theft component of the attack, Viking Spider then purchased Facebook ads in order to publicize the breach and pressure victims into paying.[15] The gang hijacked legitimate Facebook accounts to make the purchase, ensuring that neither Facebook nor law enforcement could trace the ads back to the gang. The ads made it clear that Viking Spider would release or sell their sensitive data to other criminals if the victim did not pay.\n\n The ads had two effects: targeting victims and pressuring them further. First, Facebook ads can be marketed to a specific demographic, helping the attacker ensure the correct target audience viewed the ad. This guaranteed the media and general public would be aware that the company and their data were at risk of public exposure. Second, it encouraged secondary victims to pressure the compromised organization to pay the ransom. Secondary victims are the clients of the breached company whose data is now in Viking Spider’s control. According to Brian Krebs, a security blogger, the group even outsourced the task of threatening victims to an Indian call center on at least one occasion.[16] Employees at the call center placed calls to victims, encouraging them to pay or face having their data made public. It is hard to believe any legitimate company would take on this work, but in November 2020, this exact thing took place.\n\n If this was not enough, Viking Spider used Twitter to further name and shame victims. Previously, no ransomware attacker used Facebook ads — let alone hire a call center — to harass and pressure victims into paying. Eventually, Facebook shut the ads down, forcing the gang to use their DLS website to shame and pressure victims.\n\n Viking Spider recently began incorporating distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks into their operations. The SunCrypt Gang — also a part of the Cartel — was the first to implement the tactic which both Viking Spider and Twisted Spider adapted. Viking Spider even updated their “Rules” page, stating DDoS attacks will cease as long as the victim pays the ransom. Here, they spin this as a support effort to help breached companies discover and mediate the very same flaws in which Viking Spider used to compromise them in the first place.\n\n\n###### even updated their “Rules” page, stating DDoS attacks will cease as long as the victim pays the ransom.

Viking Spider uses brute force tactics to exploit vulnerable or\n    misconfigured internet-facing devices running the remote desktop protocol\n    (RDP) leading to initial access.\n  b. Another initial access tactic Viking Spider used was to exploit vulnerable\n    remote IT management tools such as ConnectWise and Kaseya to gain access,\n    deliver malware and steal victim data from the MSP customer’s environment.\n2. Using a PowerShell command, Viking Spider downloads and compiles CobaltStrike,\n  which is compiled in the victim system’s memory. This allows the attacker to\n  avoid detection.\n3. Next, Cobalt Strike downloads Mimikatz. Mimikatz collects/obtains account\n  credentials and escalates privileges. Here, Viking Spider needs the credentials\n  to obtain administrative privileges necessary to execute the attack further.\n4. Cobalt Strike downloads and runs a batch file which identifies network drives.\n5. A Microsoft installer (.msi) downloads and installs within the victim\n  environment.\n6. The MSI installs an Oracle VirtualBox hypervisor and a Windows XP-based virtual\n  machine, including the ransomware payload.[17]\n7. The virtual machine maps and connects to the network drives identified earlier\n  in the attack.\n8. The attacker copies data from the victim environment and exfiltrates it to\n  attacker-controlled infrastructure.\n9. The attack now continues and operates from the VM within the victim environment.\n10. The attacker uses another Batch, dispersed throughout the environment designed\n  to disable various security and system services.\n11. Using the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), the attacker deletes the\n  local shadow copies via the Windows Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS), preventing\n  the victim from restoring data.\n\n```\n```\n      12. The Ragnar ransomware payload disperses to systems throughout the environment\n        and executes.\n      13. Ransom note appears to the victim for payment.\n\n###### While analyzing Viking Spider’s data leak site, Analyst1 noticed the gang’s posts onto their “Wall of Shame” increased significantly in December 2020 and decreased in January and February 2021, as seen in Figure 8:  \n\n```\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8: Wall of shame posts by month (Oct 2020 – Feb 2021)_\n\n###### Of course, this could simply indicate Viking Spider is having success, and that victims are paying the ransom without elevating the need for “shaming” them. Keep in mind the gang claims to only “name and shame” victims who do not respond or pay within the allotted time given after ransom execution. However, it could also indicate a decrease in attacks for a re-tooling period, similar to how Twisted Spider attacks using the Maze payload decreased as they prepared to introduce the Egregor payload into their attack flow. A third scenario, it is also possible that Viking Spider could be supporting other Cartel operations, in which their actual attack volume would remain consistent. Regardless, there is no reason to believe Viking Spider is going away anytime soon.\n\n Viking Spider Group Facts:\n\n**•** `First known activity: December 2019`\n\n**•** `Motivation: Financial gain`\n\n**•** `Names: Ragnar Group, Viking Spider`\n\n**•** `Spoken language: Russian`\n\n**•** `DLS Websites: ragnarleaks[.]top, rgleak7op734elep.onion,`\n```\n rgleaktxuey67yrgspmhvtnrqtgogur35lwdrup4d3igtbm3pupc4lyd[.]onion,\n p6o7m73ujalhgkiv[.]onion\n\n```\n\n\n**•** `Malware: Ragnar Locker`\n\n**•** `Ransom extension: .RGNR`\n\n**•** `Ransom note filename: .ragnar_[Unique_ID]`\n\n\n-----\n\n# Wizard Spider\n\n\n-----\n\n### Wizard Spider\n\n###### Wizard Spider is the most experienced attacker. The gang began ransom operations in August 2018, and they connected to other criminal operations as early as 2016. Analyst1 identified the below key findings during our research into Wizard Spider:\n\n • Wizard Spider has conducted ransom operations previously, using Gogalocker and MegaCortex ransomware variants, both of which are now retired. They currently perform attacks with Ryuk and Conti Ransomware.\n\n • The gang works in multiple teams, conducting simultaneous operations with different ransom payloads. Additionally, they have more malware and hacktools than any other gang associated with the Cartel.\n\n • Wizard Spider developed unique malware known as Sidoh, which was geared towards espionage. Analyst1 could not validate how Wizard Spider uses Sidoh in attacks; however, its existence alone is troubling. We found no other gang in the Cartel that uses or develops espionage malware.\n\n • Conti Ransomware uses 32 CPU threads at once to defeat defenses and encrypt data much faster than any other variant.\n\n • As of February 2021, Ryuk Ransomware includes a new “wake-on-LAN” capability, which allows it to automatically discover and spread to victim systems in the target environment.\n\n\n###### which allows it to automatically discover and spread to victim systems in the target environment.\n\n##### Wizard Spider Details\n\n###### Wizard Spider uses more malware than any other gang associated with the Cartel. Figure 9 displays the malware used by the gang since their inception.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 9: Wizard Spider malware_\n\n###### Trickbot\n\n In the early activity, criminals conducted financial attacks using spam campaigns to deliver Trickbot, which was then purposed as banking malware. Wizard Spider has only taken responsibility for its ransomware attacks, making it unclear if they were the original gang behind the banking malware operations or if they acquired access to Trickbot after the fact. Regardless, Trickbot is one of Wizard Spider’s go to resources used in Ransom operations.\n\n One of the advantages Trickbot provides comes from its distribution method. For years, Trickbot spread through high volume mass “spray and pray” spam campaigns, making it extremely prevalent and infecting many systems globally. In 2018, Wizard Spider had no interest in banking-related attacks, but they realized that they could leverage the access Trickbot provides as an entry point to launch ransomware operations. With Trickbot’s prevalence in the wild, Wizard Spider did not need to spend time and resources on the initial compromise. Instead, they could cherry-pick victims already infected with Trickbot.\n\n\n###### Ransomware Payloads\n\n Using Trickbot’s access into victim environments, Wizard Spider first began conducting ransom operations with Ryuk ransomware. Ryuk originates from Hermes ransomware and shares code with both GogaLocker and MegaCortex ransomware families. Additionally, Ryuk, GogaLocker, and MegaCortex have all shared C&C infrastructure. Attacks involving all three payloads continued until late 2019 and into early 2020, when\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Gogalocker and MegaCortex operations ceased. Based on analysis of the attacks and the ties discussed, Wizard Spider is behind attacks involving each of the ransomware variants, and they are one of the few gangs that conduct attacks using more than one ransom payload concurrently.\n\n Then in August 2020, Wizard Spider joined the Ransom Cartel. Beyond their experience alone, Wizard Spider has more tools, malware, and sophisticated capabilities than any other Cartel gangs. For example, Conti ransomware uses 32 CPU threads to defeat defenses and encrypt victim data faster than any other variant to date. It also has other unique capabilities, and it can even selectively encrypt files. For instance, it can identify data stored locally vs shared over a network. This allows Wizard Spider to focus on network Wizard Spider has more tools, shares, which typically hold valuable data while malware, and sophisticated providing the attacker the option to leave non- capabilities than any essential data on local systems alone. Focusing other Cartel gangs. on “high value data” instead of “all data” increases operational efficiency and decreases encryption time. Another interesting feature Conti ransomware has is that it utilizes the Windows restart manager, thereby allowing Conti to open and close programs to encrypt their data. There have been several variants of Conti ransomware since its introduction, each adding features and capabilities.\n\n Wizard Spider developers worked on more than Conti ransomware alone, though. In Feb 2021, the gang upgraded their Ryuk variant by adding a self-spreading, worm-like capability to the payload. Wizard Spider used a legitimate “wake-on-LAN” technology to identify and infect other hosts on the network with the Ryuk payload. The feature further allowed the attacker to power-on offline systems connected to the victim network. This ensured Wizard Spider could access all victim systems, thereby maximizing ransom encryption throughout the environment.\n\n When Wizard Spider first began using Conti ransomware, Ryuk infections declined. Due to this, it looked as though Wizard Spider might be transitioning away from Ryuk. However, as discussed, gangs often make a public statement when they retire an operation, such as when Twisted Spider announced they intended to retire Maze operations. Several other known ransomware gangs outside the Cartel have done the same when transitioning and retooling their malware and infrastructure. Again, attackers likely do this as a ploy to throw off law enforcement and researchers. If the gang retires, they may believe we would not continue to investigate. Fortunately for the good guys, it usually does not take long to connect the dots when a new operation begins.\n\n\n###### as discussed, gangs often make a public statement when they retire an operation, such as when Twisted Spider announced they intended to retire Maze operations.

Fortunately for the good guys, it usually does not take long to connect the dots when a new operation begins.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### As time passed though, Wizard Spider made no announcement, and Ryuk operations continued at a diminished rate. The new Conti operation explains the decrease in Ryuk activity, but the recent payload update is evidence that Ryuk operations are not going away any time soon. In October 2020, Wizard Spider stopped using Trickbot in their attacks. This is likely due to multiple take-down attempts from Microsoft and the U.S. government. Unfortunately, the take-down attempts did not disrupt attacks for long, and Trickbot activity still continues. Regardless, at the time of this report Trickbot has not been seen used in conjunction with new Wizard Spider ransomware attacks.\n\n Further evidence of Wizard Spider conducting concurrent operations involving both Conti and Ryuk payloads surfaced in Jan 2021 . According to a report produced by the cyber security company ClearSky, a Bitcoin wallet used by Wizard Spider received payments from other wallets used in victim extortion attacks involving both Conti and Ryuk ransomware attacks.[18]\n\n • Address #1: 1NhNuPogvydJWfTGVp41Rgghqw8MNMjTh3\n\n • Address #2: bc1qtaqrv6eeh83vk2hz9myns9lysrzmm4j4366mmw\n\n • Address #3: bc1qff0xgtxm6ansnd7dpt9ptc5n0deh3zpw5f9s58\n\n The wallets made it easy to validate ClearSky’s findings and provides us with evidence that Wizard Spider is behind both operations.\n\n The Bazar Backdoor\n\n Like Trickbot, attackers use phishing emails to spread the Bazar backdoor. However, Bazar uses the Emercoin — a decentralized DNS resolution service — to provide the malware with the address to command-and-control infrastructure. The Emercoin service uses the .bazar domain (website-name.bazar), which no other provider can use. According to Emercoin’s website, due to the design being based on a decentralized model and built on block chain technology, the infrastructure cannot be revoked or suspended, thus making it attractive to cybercriminals:\n\n\n###### “Because of Emercoin’s secure and distributed blockchain the domain name records are completely decentralized and uncensorable and cannot be altered, revoked or suspended by any authority. Only a record’s owner can modify or transfer it to another owner, and a record’s owner is determined by whoever controls the private key to the associated payment address.” — Emercoin[19]\n\n\n-----\n\n###### The Anchor Backdoor\n\n Another resource in Wizard Spider’s toolbox is the Anchor backdoor. Wizard Spider uses Anchor to compromise Point of Sale (PoS) systems and steal related financial data such as credit card information. Unlike some of the other malware discussed, Anchor is second stage malware, which attackers introduce after the initial compromise of environments believed to have PoS data. Furthermore, it does not appear in each attack. Upon collecting the data, Anchor obfuscation techniques then combine with DNS tunneling to  exfiltrate data.\n\n Sidoh Malware\n\n One of the least-used but most interesting binaries in Wizard Spider’s arsenal is Sidoh malware.[20] According to CrowdStrike, Sidoh is not designed for financial gain, unlike the other resources discussed thus far. Instead, its developer designed Sidoh for information theft. Interestingly, CrowdStrike identified strings the tool uses to search for data with the terms “military, secret, clandestine, and government”. This type of tool is typically associated with nation-state attacks geared towards espionage. Naturally, this raises many questions about why Wizard Spider uses it. As an analyst, you have to ask yourself: why would a ransomware gang need espionage malware? Analyst1 intends to find out more in upcoming research, but based on Wizard Spider’s history of attacks, it does not add up. Additionally, based on initial analysis, Sidoh shares code with Ryuk ransomware. Here, this further supports the theory that Wizard Spider created it.\n\n##### Attack Chain\n\n###### Analyst1 believes that the Wizard Spider gang is broken up into several teams. Each of these teams facilitates its ransom operation involving Ryuk and Conti ransomware. Based on this, we believe the Wizard Spider gang is larger than other ransomware attackers, given that other attackers only execute one ransom operation at a time. Utilizing multiple teams would also explain why Wizard Spider uses several attack chains. While we document the two most recently observed with Ryuk and Conti payloads, Wizard Spider has at least five different attack chains in their playbook.\n\n\n###### document the two most recently observed with Ryuk and Conti payloads, Wizard Spider has at least five different attack chains in their playbook.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Ryuk Ransomware Attack Chain\n\n_Figure 10: Wizard Spider attack chain using Ryuk Ransomware_\n```\n1.

The attacker obtains account credentials through Trickbot’s credential theft\n  module, or alternatively, through the use of Mimikatz to acquire domain admin\n  credentials.\n7. In some instances, the attacker uses the domain controllers via their admin\n  access to spread ransomware across the network.\n8. Trickbot then collects email associated files/messages and sends them back to\n  the C&C.\n9. Trickbot or CobaltStrike downloads batch files.\n  a. The batch files purposed to identify and disable attacker-selected services.\n  b. The attacker deletes the local shadow copies via the Windows Volume Shadow\n    Copy Service (VSS), preventing the victim from restoring data.\n10. Trickbot downloads the Ryuk payload.\n11. The Ryuk ransomware payload uses a wake-on-LAN capability to identify other\n  hosts, wake offline systems, and deliver the ransomware to all systems.\n12. Finally, by executing the ransom payload, the victim’s data is encrypted\n  throughout the environment.\n13. The ransom note appears on systems across the victim’s environment.\n\n###### Conti Ransomware Attack Chain\n1. Wizard Spider sends a phishing email targeting the soon-to-be victim.\n2. Unlike phishing attempts from other gangs in the Cartel, Wizard Spider often\n  uses legitimate Google docs in the form of a URL present in the email body.\n  a. The phishing email encourages the user to click the URL, which then\n    downloads a malicious document. This delivers the Bazar backdoor onto the\n    victim system.\n3. Using Bazar malware’s capabilities, Wizard Spider downloads CobaltStrike and\n  several other hacktools into the environment.\n4. Bazar creates a scheduled task to run, thus ensuring its persistence.\n5. Cobalt Strike downloads and executes Mimikatz in the memory of the victim\n  system to elude detection.\n6. The attacker uses Mimikatz to steal victim credentials.\n\n```\n```\n         a. The Bazar malware can also steal credential information from victim\n          browsers, but it is unclear if Wizard Spider fully relied on this\n          capability, since Mimikatz also steals credentials.\n      7.

It is unclear why Wizard Spider uses the tactic with Conti ransomware but not the Ryuk payload. Also, as a direct result of poor attribution practices, many security vendors and the media claim that Conti replaces Ryuk, which based on the evidence present at this time, is simply not correct.\n\n Wizard Spider Group Facts\n\n**•** `First known activity: August 2018`\n\n**•** `Motivation: Financial gain`\n\n**•** `Names: Ryuk, Conti, GogaLocker, MegaCortex and Wizard Spider`\n\n\n\n**•** `Names: Ryuk, Conti, GogaLocker, MegaCortex and Wizard Spider`\n\n**•** `Spoken language: Russian`\n\n**•** `Website: Continews[.]best, Conti[.]news, Contirecovery.news`\n\n**•** `Malware: Ryuk Ransomware, Conti Ransomware, Gogalocker Ransomware (Retired),`\n```\n        MegaCortex Ransomware (Retired), Trickbot, Emotet, Bazar, Sidoh, and Anchor\n        malware\n\n```\n**•** `Ransomware extension: .CONTI, .RYK (MegaCortex and Gogalocker ransomware`\n```\n        families excluded intentionally)\n\n```\n**•** `Ransom note name: CONTI_README.txt, RyukReadMe.txt`\n\n\n-----\n\n# Lockbit Gang\n\n\n-----\n\n### Lockbit Gang\n\n###### The Lockbit Gang first came onto the enterprise ransomware scene in September 2020. Much like the other gangs discussed so far, Lockbit brings its own unique tactics to the ransomware game. Analyst1 found the following key findings while researching the Lockbit Gang:\n\n • The Lockbit Gang was the first to automate attacks, and they remain as the most efficient Cartel attacker.\n\n • Lockbit ransomware uses a self-propagation technique. Upon execution, it issues an ARP request to identify devices within the environment, and it then connects using the SMB protocol to spread. Once connected to a live host, it executes a PowerShell command that connects to attacker C&C infrastructure. At this point, it proceeds to download the ransom payload (often disguised as an image file).\n\n • At least once, the attacker overwrote the Master Boot Record (MBR), requiring a password to boot. The Lockbit Gang achieved this through the use of the open-source tool BCDedit. BCDedit is a command-line tool that can edit the boot configuration in M.S. Windows operating systems.\n\n • The Lockbit Gang conducts interviews about their attacks with news media.\n\n##### Lockbit Gang Details\n\n###### We mentioned the Lockbit Gang is the most efficient ransomware attacker to date. Most attackers spend days to weeks actively working in a victim’s network before executing the ransom payload. However, the Lockbit Gang has compromised victims and automates their attacks, allowing them to move from initial access to ransom execution in just a few hours. While their attacks are far more efficient, they require the Lockbit Gang to gain administrative access early in the attack.\n\n One such example of Lockbit’s efficiency comes from Darktrace. Darktrace is a leading AI cyber defense company, and in a February 2021 they identified a Lockbit attack. During this attack, the gang moved from initial breach to payload execution within two hours.[21] Fortunately, in this occurrence, Dark Trace’s technology allowed the victim to mitigate the attack, but this is not always the case. Again, this efficiency is significant, as it gives defenders far less time to identify when an attacker is present on their network. In regards to their methodology, the Lockbit Gang uses the ransomware, tools present in the environment, and a commodity keylogger in their attacks.\n\n\n###### One such example of Lockbit’s efficiency comes from Darktrace.

Again, this efficiency is significant, as it gives defenders far less time to identify when an attacker is present on their network. In regards to their methodology, the Lockbit Gang uses the ransomware, tools present in the environment, and a commodity keylogger in their attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 13: Lockbit Gang malware overview_\n\n###### The attacker also appears to be learning from mistakes in previous attacks, growing in sophistication. In early operations, the group used the file transfer protocol (FTP) to exfiltrate victim data. The problem with this tactic is that FTP transmits data in clear text. Moving large amounts of data from the victim environment could very easily draw attention to the attacker. In recent attacks however, the Lockbit Gang has changed tactics and switched to using an IPSEC tunnel to create an encrypted channel to exfiltrate victim data, eluding detection.\n\n The operational efficiency seen across attacks is not an afterthought with the Lockbit gang, but a primary focus. The streamlined capabilities seen in attacks began in the development phase of Lockbit ransomware. For example, its developer devised many features into its code design, automating portions of the attack chain using a worm-like capability to spread throughout the environment. Specifically, it leverages the Server Message Protocol (SMB) to identify other hosts and network shares within the target environment. Then, using batch files, Lockbit issues PowerShell commands from each discovered host, having them download, execute, and infect themselves with Lockbit’s ransom payload. Of course, there is more to the attack, which we discuss next in the Lockbit Attack Chain.\n\n##### Attack Chain\n```\n1. The attacker uses brute force techniques to exploit un-patched vulnerable VPN\n  software.\n  a. In the attack observed, the victim’s VPN software flaw resulted in the\n    attacker gaining access to a domain admin account.\n\n```\n```\n          attacker gaining access to a domain admin account.\n      2. Unlike all other attacks discussed, Lockbit attacks are automated. After\n        gaining initial access, the malware identifies a single host and delivers the\n        ransomware payload.\n      3. Using their administrative access, security services are disabled on the\n        infected host, such as Windows Defender and the system firewall.\n      4. A keylogger/screen capture tool (HAKOPS Keylogger) is also dropped on the\n        infected system that captures the victim’s keystrokes, takes screenshots, and\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n  transmits data once per day to an FTP server located in Ukraine.\n5. The malware instructs the victim system to delete local shadow copies via the\n  Windows Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSSADMIN) to prevent data restoration.\n6. Next, the ransomware instructs the victim system to transmit a broadcast\n  ARP request to all hosts in order to identify other systems present in the\n  environment.\n7. Now that the network is enumerated and systems and the servers have been\n  identified, the malware issues a PowerShell command instructing each of the\n  hosts to establish a connection with attacker-controlled infrastructure and\n  download an image (.PNG file) that drops a malicious PE.\n8. In other occurrences, the attacker downloads additional hacktools in order to \n  lock the user out of their desktop. This prevents the user from interfering\n  with the ransom encryption process once initiated.\n9. Upon execution, the downloaded binary installs Lockbit ransomware onto each\n  system identified in the previous discovery step.\n10. Finally, the ransomware encrypts the victim’s files and delivers the ransom\n  note.\n11. In one at least one attack, MBR is also encrypted on victim systems.\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n##### Attack Chain Two \n\n_Figure 15: Lockbit Attack Chain two (Derived from research first published by Sophos Security)[22]_\n```\n1. The specifics of the initial compromise with this particular attack chain\n  are unknown, but Lockbit likely uses other common vectors such as phishing\n  emails that deliver malicious lure docs. Interestingly, according to Sophos,\n  the victims they observed had no public (Internet) facing systems, but many of\n  their internal systems had poor security hygiene.\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n4. The next script instructs the victim to connect to Lockbit’s C&C server and\n  download yet another script. This script then copies and renames PowerShell.exe\n  and Microsoft Scripting Host, MSHTA.exe.\n5. Next, using the resources copied in the previous step, the attacker instructs\n  the system to create a task which uses Visual Basic to “invoke” a secondary\n  backdoor to ensure persistence.\n  a. Lockbit also uses a .LNK file, which is placed into the Windows startup\n    directory.\n  b. The .LNK file essentially downloads and compiles another backdoor onto the\n    victim system at startup.\n6. Several other downloaded modules check and disable security services and\n  applications, delete backup services, and conduct other attack related\n  functions.\n7. The backdoors communicate with Lockbit C&C servers, and depending on the\n  response, they will create an IPsec tunnel to copy and exfiltrate victim data.\n8. Finally, a PowerShell script invokes WMI to download and distribute the Lockbit\n  payload onto systems throughout the environment.\na. Ransom payload executes, displaying the ransom across the victim systems.\n\n###### After Lockbit completes the operation’s data theft and encryption phase, the double extortion stage begins. Like most other gangs in the Cartel, the Lockbit Gang hosts their own data leak site to name and shame the victim. Additionally, Lockbit adds a secure chat room on their website for victims to communicate during ransom negotiations. Historically, ransomware attackers used publicly available and free email accounts like Proton mail — a legitimate email service based on encryption and secure communications ­— to negotiate with victims. By using their own secure chat infrastructure to host negotiations, they leave no email trail for law enforcement to investigate. Essentially, this removed one more piece of evidence that could lead back to the individuals behind the gang.\n\n```\n\n_Figure 16: Trial decrypt and chat function on Lockbit’s data leak site._\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Amusingly, Lockbit presents themselves as a “support” service that, for a fee — AKA the ransom payment — will help the victim restore their data and even harden their security posture by disclosing the vulnerabilities discovered in the initial breach. Figure 17 displays Lockbit’s data leak website.\n\n_Figure 17: Lockbit’s data leak and wall of shame website._\n\n###### Unlike some of the other Cartel gangs discussed, the Lockbit Gang has not resorted to name-calling in their DLS, and they have remained professional regardless of payment.\n\n Despite these advanced tactics discussed, the Lockbit Gang struggled in early operations to establish itself amongst its peers before they joined the Cartel. A cybercriminal claiming to be a Lockbit affiliate — one who supported four months of ransom operations — claimed problems existed in the attack.[23] According to the affiliate, the problems surrounded the ransomware’s encryption method, and Lockbit Gang could not decrypt victim files. It is standard operating procedure across most enterprise ransomware attacks to decrypt a small number of files as proof that the encryption key will work once the victim pays. If the Lockbit Gang could not decrypt the victim files as proof, it is unlikely a victim would pay the ransom. Naturally, these problems resulted in a loss of profit. The affiliate did their part in the attack, and despite that they never got paid for their work. As an affiliate\n\n\n-----\n\n###### working for a RaaS provider, this is a big issue. Now, the Lockbit leak site provides a file decryption service, shown in Figure 16. Since the gang built the feature into their website they likely resolved the file decryption problem.\n\n Lockbit Gang Group Facts\n\n**•** `First known activity: September 2019`\n\n**•** `Names: Lockbit gang`\n\n**•** `Motivation: Financial gain`\n\n**•** `Spoken language: Russian`\n\n**•** `Website: lockbitkodidilol[.]onion, Lockbit-decryptor[.]com, Lockbit-decryptor[.]top,`\n```\n lockbitks2tvnmwk[.]onion\n\n```\n**•** `C&C: https://espet[.]se/images/rs35[.]png, https://espet[.]se/images/rs40.png,`\n```\n 142.91.170.6\n\n```\n**•** `Malware: Lockbit Ransomware, Hakops Keylogger`\n\n**•** `Ransom extension: .lockbit, .ABCD (legacy)`\n\n**•** `Ransom filename: Restore-My-Files.txt`\n\n\n-----\n\n# The SunCrypt Gang\n\n\n-----\n\n### The SunCrypt Gang\n\n###### The SunCrypt Gang began conducting ransomware attacks in October 2019. Analyst1 researched the attacks and progression of SunCrypt operations up to present day and found the following key findings:\n\n • SunCrypt is the first gang to introduce DDoS as an extortion tactic used in conjunction with enterprise ransomware attacks.\n\n • The SunCrypt Gang claimed affiliation with both Twisted Spider and the Cartel. Twisted Spider disputed both claims in an interview with Bleeping Computer.\n\n • SunCrypt ransomware uses the ChaCha20 stream cipher found in Twisted Spider’s Maze and Egregor ransomware payloads.\n\n • The SunCrypt gang’s ransomware communicated with two C&C IP addresses that Twisted Spider used and controlled in their Maze ransomware operations. These findings are significant, since Twisted Spider disputes the SunCrypt Gang’s Cartel affiliation claim.\n\n • Operations ceased in October 2020, but transfers from victims’ bitcoin wallets continued until November 2020.\n\n##### SunCrypt Details\n\n###### Much like any good reality TV show, drama ensued between the SunCrypt Gang and Twisted Spider after the gang publicly claimed affiliation to the Cartel. In late August 2020, Bleeping Computer publicly released the conversation between the two gangs, wherein each party told their side of the story. Bleeping Computer first reported that the SunCrypt Gang emailed them directly, detailing their new affiliation with the Ransom Cartel. Even stranger, six days after the publication, Twisted Spider contacted Bleeping Computer disputing the claims:\n\n\n###### “We do not have any connections with SunCrypt, it is a lie.”\n\n “We do not know why SunCrypt does it, but we believe it is a PR strategy, to send links to companies in chat that they are working with us as a pressure.”\n\n — Reported by Bleeping Computer[24]\n\n While Twisted Spider disputed SunCrypt’s claim, their story did not line up with the facts. Despite claiming that the two groups had no affiliation, SunCrypt and Twisted Spider\n\n\n-----\n\n###### actually shared C&C infrastructure. Advanced Intel’s Vitali Kremez first identified that both attackers leveraged IP addresses 91.218.114[.]30 and 91.218.114[.]31 for C&C in their attacks.[25] Further, Maze, Egregor (Twisted Spider), and SunCrypt (SunCrypt gang) payloads each use the\n SunCrypt is the first\n Cha Cha stream cipher to encrypt victim data.\n ransomware gang\n Just after the public dispute with Twisted Spider in to use DDoS attacks early September, the SunCrypt gang began to deploy in conjunction with DDoS attacks in conjunction with ransomware in its\n ransomware in its\n operations. As previously mentioned, SunCrypt is the\n operations\n first ransomware gang to use this tactic, and other gangs within the Cartel quickly adopted the strategy. Interestingly, despite claiming no affiliation with SunCrypt, Twisted Spider was the first to adopt the tactic. If having data encrypted and stolen was not enough, now victims had to deal with business loss due to their websites and services being unavailable to their customers. The downed services and unreachable websites may tip off victim clients and draw attention publicly; this of course places additional pressure on the victim to pay the ransom quickly.\n\n Strangely, the SunCrypt Gang disappeared shortly after the addition of the DDoS tactic and their public dispute with Twisted Spider. The gang appears to have abandoned operations, but oddly, their data leak sites remain up. Coincidentally, Twisted Spider terminated Maze ransomware operations around the same timeframe. However, in its closure, Twisted Spider took down their data leak site infrastructure. Let’s examine this idea a bit further: suppose a gang is closing down operations, or perhaps they are retooling for the next phase of its criminal activities. In that case, it only makes sense to remove any trace of their previous attacks and infrastructure. If for no other reason, taking down the infrastructure would prevent it from later being used as evidence against the gang. Similarly, this could prevent law enforcement from tracing the infrastructure back to the attacker. While affiliate hackers claim the SunCrypt Gang retired, the sudden departure after their dispute with Twisted Spider remains suspicious.\n\n\n###### Furthermore, Twisted Spiders and the SunCrypt Gang’s data leak sites have press release pages to communicate and make announcements. Why did the SunCrypt Gang not use their press release page to announce their retirement as other attackers have done? Figure 18 shows the last update to the press section of SunCrypt’s site.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 18: SunCrypt Press release webpage on their data leak site_\n\n###### Historically, both groups have reputations for talking to the media. When Twisted Spider retired Maze operations, they posted a press release to their website announcing their intention. In addition to not making a press release, the gang never reached out to the media or used social media to announce retiring operations in any way. Instead, they just disappeared in their prime. The only information about their retirement comes from Kela — an Israeli cyberthreat intelligence monitoring firm — who found SunCrypt affiliates (not the core gang) who commented on an underground forum, explaining that the SunCrypt program was closing.[26]\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Attack Chain\n\n_Figure 19: SunCrypt Gang attack chain_\n```\n1. The attacker gains initial access by using multiple vectors. The attacker\n  sent spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments or brute-forced RDP\n  connections on victim infrastructure.\n2. PowerShell commands issued to download and compile CobaltStrike in the memory\n  of the infected system.\n3. Next, CobaltStrike downloads Mimikatz and uses it to obtain administrative\n  credentials.\n4. The attacker copies and exfiltrates victim data.\n5. A batch script is downloaded and dispersed to systems throughout the environment.\n6. Scripts run, executing commands to delete shadow copies necessary for data\n  restoration.\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n###### Following the payment transactions from SunCrypt operations provides insight into the revenue generated from their attacks. One of the victims made two transactions involving a SunCrypt wallet address. The first was for one bitcoin; this is typically done in attacks to validate the transaction and wallets before sending larger amounts. In the second transaction, the victim paid the SunCrypt Gang over 31 bitcoin for a total of ~$350,000 (based on bitcoin currency value at the time the attack took place).\n\n_Figure 20: SunCrypt ransom payment in bitcoin (Constella Intelligence Hunter platform)_\n\n###### Of note, the attack involving this bitcoin wallet took place in September 2020, several weeks before SunCrypt ceased operations. However, the money was not moved out of the account until November 17th, almost two months after the gang disappeared. Yet another piece of evidence that does not add up.\n\n SunCrypt Gang Group Facts\n\n**•** `First known activity: October 2019`\n\n**•** `Motivation: Financial gain`\n\n\n_Figure 20: SunCrypt ransom payment in bitcoin (Constella Intelligence Hunter platform)_\n\n\n-----\n\n# Cartel Assessment\n\n\n-----\n\n### Cartel Assessment\n\n###### In November 2020, Twisted Spider — the gang who began the Cartel — announced that they were shutting down operations. In a further twist, they also claimed the Cartel never existed! In their last press release, Twisted Spider stated the Cartel was only real in journalists’ minds. Based on the events detailed throughout this paper and the specific ties between the Cartel gangs outlined next, Twisted Spider’s claims are untrue.\n\n The initial claim the gang was retiring was misleading. The tactics used in the attacks overlap in infrastructure, and the technical similarities between Egregor and Maze ransomware made for strong attribution. Clearly, Twisted Spider was behind both operations. The second claim stating the Cartel never existed was not as clear-cut.\n\n Twisted Spider, Viking Spider, Wizard Spider, the Lockbit gang, and the SunCrypt gang claimed they were a ransomware Cartel. Why would all of these criminal gangs speak out publicly, stating they had joined together? To further assess, Analyst1 looked to the evidence to make our own assessment.\n\n The first tie we found provided evidence that the groups are working together and sharing resources to extort victims. Several gangs compromised and stole victim data, which they passed on to Twisted Spider. Twisted Spider then posted the victim’s data and attempted to negotiate a ransom on their data leak site. This type of collaboration and sharing would not occur unless all three criminal elements had a trusted relationship with one another. Figure 21 below is a visualization of the Ties A and B which we discuss next.\n\n##### Tie A: Shared Data Leak Sites\n\n###### In May 2020, Viking Spider compromised MJ Brunner of brunnerworks.com. After the compromise, Viking Spider posted Brunner’s data to their leak site, ragnerleaks[.]top. A few weeks later in June 2020, Twisted Spider posted Brunner data on Viking Spider’s behalf along with threatening messages to their data leak site, mazenews[.]top. Not long after, a similar situation took place. This time, the Lockbit Gang breached and attempted to extort a target: the Smith Group. At the time however, the Lockbit Gang did not have a data leak site. In a continued effort to share Cartel resources, Twisted Spider posted the stolen data to their site, mazenews[.]top, on behalf of the Lockbit gang. Furthermore, Twisted Spider referenced both the Cartel and each member gang who originally stole the data on both occasions. Figure 22 shows the post below.\n\n\n###### after, a similar situation took place. This time, the Lockbit Gang breached and attempted to extort a target: the Smith Group.

Yet, beginning in October 2020 in their early operations, Twisted Spider used two IP addresses, 91.218.114[.]30\n\n\n-----\n\n###### & 31 for command-and-control infrastructure.[29,30] Ten months later, the SunCrypt Gang used the same IP addresses for command-and-control to deliver ransomware in their attacks. Granted, the tie would be stronger if the IP used in ransom operations took place during the same time frame. However, Twisted Spider used the 91.218.114.3X range for attacks over at least six months. The extended use and address range indicates that this was persistent infrastructure that Twisted Spider frequently used and controlled themselves. It is unlikely that the SunCrypt Gang would have access to the infrastructure if they did not have a trusted relationship with Twisted Spider. Table 1 below details the evidence supporting Tie B.\n\n**Sha2 Hash** **Ransomware** **Affiliation** **Date** **C&C**\n\n91514e6be3f581a77daa79e2a4905dcb Maze Twisted Spider 10/2019 91.218.114.30,\ndf6bdcc32ee0f713599a94d453a26fc1 91.218.114.31\n\nE3DEA10844AEBC7D60AE330F2730 SunCrypt SunCrypt gang 08/2020 91.218.114.30,\nB7ED9D18B5EEC02EF9FD4A394660E82E2219 91.218.114.31\n\n_Table 1: Shared IP space used as C&C for both Twisted Spider and the SunCrypt gang_\n\n###### Other Ties:\n\n Several other circumstantial and technical ties exist as well. These are weaker ties, and you should not use them for attribution on their own, but they are worth discussing collectively:\n\n • Maze and Egregor ransomware (Twisted Spider) SunCrypt ransomware (SunCrypt Gang) use the Cha Cha stream cypher to encrypt data.\n\n • All of the gangs build checks and balances into their ransomware to ensure the payload does not execute on Russian victims.\n\n • Gangs in the Cartel share and adapt each other’s tactics:\n\n • Double extortion technique (data theft and data encryption)\n\n • DDoS in conjunction with data theft and data encryption\n\n|Sha2 Hash|Ransomware|Affliiation|Date|C&C|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|91514e6be3f581a77daa79e2a4905dcb df6bdcc32ee0f713599a94d453a26fc1|Maze|Twisted Spider|10/2019|91.218.114.30, 91.218.114.31|\n|E3DEA10844AEBC7D60AE330F2730 B7ED9D18B5EEC02EF9FD4A394660E82E2219|SunCrypt|SunCrypt gang|08/2020|91.218.114.30, 91.218.114.31|\n\n\n\n###### • DDoS in conjunction with data theft and data encryption\n\n • Use of VM within victim environments to execute attacks and avoid detection\n\n • Use of data leak websites to name and shame victims\n\n • Additionally, each gang discussed has claimed affiliation to the Cartel. Some made claims to reporters while others posted on leak sites and social media.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Closing\n\n###### Analyst1 assesses that the Cartel is not an authentic entity, but instead a collective of criminal gangs who, at times, work together in ransom operations. There needs to be more than cooperation, resource, and tactic sharing between gangs for their partnership to qualify as a true Cartel, though. Profit-sharing is the primary element missing in the coalition of ransomware attackers discussed. Cartels are dangerous due to the large financial resources that profit-sharing provides.\n\n Analyst1 researched all known bitcoin wallets and their associated transactions associated with the gangs discussed. We followed the money trail and observed examples of victims paying a gang and gangs paying their affiliates, but we did not find any evidence that the gangs share profits with other gangs in the Cartel.\n\n We believe the gangs created the Cartel facade to appear larger, stronger more powerful to further intimidate victims into paying ransom demands. The illusion and public claims made about the Cartel achieved the desired effect; however, it also brought global attention from law enforcement and government entities. We believe this prompted Twisted Spider to lie about retiring, and this explains why they attempted to retract their Cartel affiliation. For the same reasons, Twisted Spider stopped communicating publicly, and they no longer use social media or press releases to voice their demands.\n\n Moving forward, Analyst1 believes these ransomware gangs will continue to work with one another. The working relationship, however, will likely continue to be done behind the scenes and not on a public level. Groups will continue to share tactics and resources, making them far more dangerous than if they were operating independently. Both ransomware and malware used to gain initial compromise will increase in their levels of sophistication and capability. Specifically, Analyst1 believes ransomware gangs will focus development efforts to automate attacks. The new capabilities gangs are introducing into their ransomware demonstrate that automation is essential. Analyst1 believes this trend will continue making ransomware operations more efficient and dangerous. As automation capabilities increase, the use of affiliate hackers will decrease. This means ransomware gangs do not have to share profits with affiliates, thus increasing the revenue derived from each attack. With the decrease in the timeframe it takes to execute each attack, Analyst1 believes the overall volume of attacks will grow, raising the number of victims extorted.\n\n\n###### automation capabilities increase, the use of affiliate hackers will decrease.
