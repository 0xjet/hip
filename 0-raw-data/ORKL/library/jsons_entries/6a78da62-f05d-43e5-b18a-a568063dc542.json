The](https://www.coveware.com/blog/q2-2020-ransomware-marketplace-report)\nsum has grown not only because of the continually increasing activity of ransomware\noperators, but also due to their efforts in finding new ways of monetizing their malicious\nactivities and threatening victims. These new TTPs include:\n\nStealing data and requesting double ransoms;\nCollaborating with other ransomware gangs;\nUsing stolen data to attack other victims;\nSelling stolen data on auctions;\nNotifying media, as well as victims’ partners and clients about leaks;\nScraping credit cards.\n\nNovel tactics were adopted not only by infamous gangs such as Maze and Sodinokibi\n(REvil), but also by less-popular runner-ups, such as Netwalker, Ragnar Locker, Ako, and\nothers.\n\nKELA is regularly monitoring these ransomware gangs’ blogs and observes an average of\n10-20 new victims each week – implying that the actual number of victims can be much\nhigher since we’re only seeing the victims who did not pay a ransom. In addition, there are\nthose who cooperated with cybercriminals and therefore did not appear in the blogs.\n\nThe following piece will focus on how the ransomware operators diversify their schemes and\nimplement so-called “marketing efforts,” related to threatening victims, in order to gain more\nprofits.\n\n## One Ransom Is Not Enough\n\nDuring the year 2020, it became clear that more and more ransomware gangs prefer to\n**steal the data before encrypting it, to use it as leverage in ransom negotiations. This**\nactivity includes outing some victims in specially-created blogs, as recently seen being done\nby [developers of the Avaddon ransomware or by those of Darkside – a rather new](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/avaddon-ransomware-launches-data-leak-site-to-extort-victims/)\nransomware in the game.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis tactic stems from the variety of the extortion activities used by various cybercriminal\ngroups in the past. For example, the notorious hacking group known as The Dark Overlord\n(TDO) had been hacking companies and stealing their data from 2016 till 2019. TDO’s\nvictims included Netflix, ABC, Disney, and other prominent organizations – a lot of their data\nwas leaked or sold after the companies refused to pay a ransom. Moreover, TDO was\nterrorizing US schools with various threats using a list of phone numbers for students,\nteachers, and school staffers. The group stopped its activity in 2019 but the extortion never\nstopped.\n\nA pioneer of the naming-and-shaming tactic is the Snatch team, which manages the\nransomware of the same name. In May 2019, the group went public with customer data\nbelonging to German IT company, Citycomp, which further exposed data related to BT,\nEricsson, Hugo Boss, and SAP. The gang created a website and released the data when\nCitycomp did not succumb to blackmail; later, the group published additional breaches. Now,\nthe Snatch gang doesn’t seem to be active in terms of intimidating the victims through their\nblog, but it’s still actively attacking organizations and encrypting files. However, other\nransomware gangs picked up the tactic.\n\nIn November 2019, the Maze team was observed making one of the first public double\nextortion cases affecting Allied Universal. After the company refused to pay, the Maze team\npublished 700 MB worth of data and files stolen from the company, as well as demanded a\nnew ransom that was 50% higher than the original one.\n\nPer our research, ransomware gangs, that are actively continuing to leak files on their blogs\n(meaning that they updated their websites at least once in the last two months), include*:\n\nAko\nAvaddon\nClop\nDarkside\nDopplepaymer\nMaze\nNefilim\nNetwalker\nPysa\nRagnar Locker\nSekhmet\nSodinokibi (REvil)\n\n*On the same day when this research was published, two more ransomware gangs\nannounced that they started their blogs – Conti and SunCrypt.\n\n\n-----\n\nThese ransomware strains include both exclusively managed ransomware and RaaS\n[(Ransomware-as-a-Service) type, which involves cooperating with initial access brokers for](https://ke-la.com/the-secret-life-of-an-initial-access-broker/)\ninitiating attacks and affiliates for performing them. The mentioned ransomware gangs have\ndifferent targets across different sectors and utilize very different TTPs. For example,\n[Sodinokibi uses mostly RDP compromise in conjunction with email phishing and software](https://www.coveware.com/blog/q2-2020-ransomware-marketplace-report)\nvulnerabilities, while Maze relies on phishing attacks as its main infection vector.\n\n**So how is all this activity connected to double ransoms?** **It appears that certain**\n**ransomware gangs from this list are now asking two separate ransoms: one for**\n**decrypting the files and another one for deleting the leaked data. For example, it was**\nmentioned when the Maze group offered discounts amid coronavirus: “Discounts are offered\nfor both decrypting files and deleting of the leaked data.”\n\nSome other ransomware gangs specified it in their blogs. For instance, Ragnar Locker\ndescribed such an offer in a post of one of the victims: “We made an offer for decryption and\nto delete all downloaded information without posting.” Ako also stated about one of the\nvictims: “Got only payment for decrypt – 350,000$. Payment for delete stolen files was not\nreceived.”\n\n_Maze website_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Ragnar Locker website_\n\n_Ako website_\n\n[The most recent example is a case of Blackbaud, a provider of software and cloud hosting](https://www.zdnet.com/article/cloud-provider-stopped-ransomware-attack-but-had-to-pay-ransom-demand-anyway/#ftag=RSSbaffb68)\nsolutions. The company managed to stop the attack and prevent encrypting of its files,\nthough it still had to pay ransom for deleting the data that the ransomware operators\nmanaged to steal (it’s not clear what ransomware was used in the attack). Thus, the\n**exfiltration of data is becoming a more profitable business model for ransomware**\n**operators, rather than just encrypting files.**\n\nAs 14 ransomware gangs are now stealing data and publishing it in their blogs, we can\nassume that more ransomware operators will adopt the tactic and will require double\nransoms. Possibly, some of them, specifically small-scale operations, will not create their\nown blogs, but rather collaborate with other gangs. This way they can make use of the stolen\ninformation and gain profit even if a victim refuses to pay; and this is the next rising trend.\n\n## Collaborate and Intimidate\n\n\n-----\n\nDrug cartels are old news; instead, ransomware cartels are intending to receive more\nprominent attention nowadays. Again, an innovator in this field is the Maze ransomware\ngang which formed the “Maze cartel” to publish leaks of other ransomware groups.\n\nOn June 2, 2020, Maze [announced a new collaboration between this group and the LockBit](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-gangs-team-up-to-form-extortion-cartel/)\nransomware team by adding files on a new victim as “provided by LockBit” and under the\nlabel of “Maze Cartel”. This data was stolen during the attack on international architectural\nfirm Smith Group – an attack that had actually been performed by the actors behind LockBit\nwho do not maintain their own blog.\n\n_Maze website_\n\nWhen answering a request from reporters, the Maze operators confirmed that they were\nworking with LockBit and added that another ransomware group would be joining this\ncooperation in a few days. This “other” group turned out to be Ragnar Locker, first\ndiscovered in December 2019 and, among other reasons, known for its attack on the\nPortuguese multinational energy giant Energias de Portugal (EDP).\n\n\n-----\n\nSo, on June 8, 2020, Maze published another breach under the Maze Cartel label on their\nblog, while the information already appeared a month earlier on Ragnar’s blog. The leaked\ndata belonged to marketing firm M.J. Brunner Inc, and BhiveLab – a marketing innovation\nlab, launched by M.J. Brunner; in addition, the same post featured their client SEI\nInvestments, though it was breached separately (it will be discussed in the following sections\nof this post).\n\n_Maze website_\n\nMoreover, RagnarLocker and Maze proceed to exchange the data. On June 12, 2020, the\nRagnarLocker group published files belonging to ST Engineering, previously breached by\nMaze, on its blog and stated that the leak was “provided by Maze”, making this collaboration\ntwo-sided. Specifically, the published data belonged to a subsidiary company, called VT San\nAntonio Aerospace, which provides aerospace services. As Maze revealed later, the\ncompany denied negotiations.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Ragnar Locker website_\n\nIt is not known if Maze used financial motivation to attract these two ransomware gangs to its\ncartel. Since Ragnar Locker did not only provide the data, but also shared some of Maze’s\ndata in its blog, we can assume that this cooperation is not about a vendor-buyer\nrelationship, where Maze could “buy out” victims as some sort of a collecting agency.\n\nPossible financial cooperation can be related to sharing a ransom payment if the outed victim\nstill decides to pay to prevent further leakage of the data, intimidated by joint activities of the\nransomware operators. If the ransom is not paid, the ransomware gangs could likely share\nprofits if they sell the stolen data on underground forums.\n\nHowever, based on the fact that these cooperation efforts were spotted over a month ago\nand we did not see any new postings, we can assume that “Cartel” was just another\nmarketing effort for ransomware gangs. It means that threat actors behind the\n**ransomware decided to jointly promote the leaks in order to intimidate victims, but it**\n**is hardly possible that they collaborated in terms of further monetizing the stolen**\n**data.**\n\nThis assumption is supported by the fact that there is no evidence of any actual real\ncooperation on the backend of things. For example, though LockBit doesn’t have its own\nblog, it still maintains an independent profile on forums which is being used for affiliate\n\n\n-----\n\nrecruitment. In its turn, Ragnar Locker s blog is still online and was updated with three new\nvictims to their site without any of Maze’s help. Between Ragnar Locker and LockBit, we did\nnot notice any signs of cooperation as well.\n\n[Sodinokibi, known as another experimenter in the ransomware scene (it also remains to be](https://www.coveware.com/blog/q2-2020-ransomware-marketplace-report)\nthe most common ransomware (while Maze has the second place in terms of activity), was\nnot spotted using this tactic. Probably, it is related to the fact it does not need additional\npromotion of its victims since it already has a big enough name with its GandCrab legacy.\nGandCrab was a ransomware operation that shut down in 2019 and was found to have many\nsimilarities with the Sodinokibi ransomware. The Sodinokibi developers claimed they were\naffiliates of GandCrab and obtained the ransomware’s source code.\n\nThough threat actors behind Sodinokibi were really active at the start, spotted\ncommunicating on forums and even leaking victims’ data, they significantly cut their\npresence on the forums after establishing the blog. Now they only continue to regularly\nrecruit affiliates, though the developers are quite picky: they prioritize teams with experience\nand accesses to networks.\n\n_User UNKN, which is considered to be Sodinokibi’s representative on a Russian-speaking underground_\n_forum, is looking for affiliates_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Another recruiting post written by Sodinokibi’s representative_\n\nLike its closest (though still far behind) rival Maze, Sodinokibi also implemented new tactics.\n[For example, recently they were spotted in the campaign scanning the networks of victims to](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/sodinokibi-ransomware-cobalt-strike-pos)\nscrape for credit card and point of sale (PoS) software. There are two possible reasons why\nSodinokibi were looking for PoS software. First, in an attempt to scrape credit card data and\nthen to use compromised cards or sell it to other cybercriminals. Second – just for encrypting\nthe PoS software as part of their attacks. Since this tactic is unclear and was not used by\nother ransomware, it is hard to be considered a trend, though Sodinokibi has a bunch of\ntricks on which we will elaborate further. However, there is another TTP related to\ncollaboration that needs to be explored prior to that.\n\n## Using Stolen Data to Attack Others\n\nAs was mentioned when Maze published data provided by Ragnar Locker, another company,\nnot mentioned in the original post, was featured among the victims. It was SEI Investments\nCompany, which appears to be a client of BHiveLab, as stated in the media: “Clients using\nthe new practice include Mars, SEI Investments and GlaxoSmithKline.”\n\nBack at that time, it was not clear whether SEI was attacked separately, or if the Maze\noperators simply noticed the company’s files in already stolen data from BHiveLab and M.J.\nBrunner and highlighted it as a marketing lure. However, after a few days, Maze clarified this\nvictim in its “official press release”, containing recommendations to refrain from working with\nnegotiators or decrypting files on one’s own after suffering the ransomware attack.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Maze website_\n\nAt the end of the press release, Maze mentioned that its member breached SEI Investments\ncompany using information previously stolen from BHiveLab and M.J. Brunner. This implies\nanother vector in ransomware gangs’ cooperation and another threat to all ecosystems\naround breached companies.\n\nCompanies that suffer ransomware attacks must also be wary of the potential impact it has\non their vendors, clients, or other partners. The related parties immediately become\nvulnerable to an attack as well – not just because of the leaked mutual data, but also\nbecause of potential compromise in the future. Maze stated it quite clearly in one of their\npress releases (from April 17, 2020; screenshot provided below): “We will use the information\ngotten to attack your clients and partners.”\n\n_Maze website_\n\n\n-----\n\nWe expect this trend growing, as ransomware gangs become more sophisticated and\ncapable of analyzing the stolen information not just from the focus of releasing and selling\ndata, but also with the intention of finding new initial attack vectors.\n\n## We Will Auction Your Data and Notify Your Partners\n\nModern ransomware gangs do not just use cartels to intimidate victims – they also invent\nnew threats on their own.\n\nIn June 2020, the Sodinokibi operators launched a new auction page used to sell their\nvictims’ stolen data, implying that victims’ partners will be interested in buying it. To\nparticipate in such an auction, a minimum deposit of 10% from the start price is required.\nAlso, auctioned data can be bought immediately at a “Blitz price” ranging from $50,000 to\n$42 million.\n\nAt the moment of writing the article, 15 auctions are active on Sodinokibi’s blog and not one\nof them received a top bid, leading to publishing the data of the lot. 22 auctions in total were\nheld to date, though once again there are no top bets available.\n\n_Sodinokibi website_\n\n\n-----\n\nSince the Sodinokibi gang still publishes the data if the auction was unsuccessful, it seems\nthat they do not consider these auctions as an effective way of increasing their income.\nPossibly, they see it as another means of pressuring their victims and prompting them to pay\nthe ransom. Thus, we do not expect other ransomware gangs to hold such auctions;\nhowever, it can be regarded as another trick in the growing list of new ways to intimidate the\nvictims.\n\n_Sodinokibi website where it is stated that non-sold data was published for free_\n\n**As one of these methods, we can also consider how the ransomware operators are**\n**strengthening their ransom requests by claiming that they will send the link to the**\n**blog to all customers, partners, investors, and other interested parties. Such a threat**\nhas been recently made by the same Sodinokibi gang in a post about a new victim where\nthey also addressed competitors and employees, inviting them to buy out the stolen data and\nsue the company.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Sodinokibi’s website_\n\nMaze also exhaustively stated their intentions in the aforementioned press release: they are\nthreatening to sell commercially valuable information on the darknet, notify media and stock\nexchanges about a breach and use the leaked information to attack clients and partners of\nvictims.\n\nNew players are keeping up with raising the stakes in their threats: the developers of new\nDarkside ransomware promised to store leaked data for six months and send notifications of\nthe leak to all partners and customers.\n\nTherefore, based on observed auctions and announcements meant to intimidate victims, we\n**can conclude that cybercriminals went from private threats, made in the negotiations**\n**with victims via chats, to public threats, which involve using both darknet and open**\n**sources and can intimidate victims much more.**\n\nTo sum up, all the analyzed ransomware gangs represent a new generation of cybercriminals\ncapable of evolving their tactics and diversifying their activities in order to gain more profit,\ntherefore posing a significant threat to all organizations. Thus, regular monitoring of\n\n\n-----\n\nransomware blogs can significantly benefit organizations and help them to reduce the risk of\nbeing attacked.\n\n\n-----",
