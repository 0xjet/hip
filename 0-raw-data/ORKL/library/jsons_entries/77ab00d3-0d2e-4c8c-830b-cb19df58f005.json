The vacuum was quickly filled, however. Forensic and\nmalware evidence was soon discovered connecting GandCrab’s malware to a new\nransomware variant which was about to wreak havoc on a global scale: REvil.\n\n[REvil’s rise was rapid. It has victimized enterprises and](https://www.wsj.com/articles/travelex-ransomware-outage-hits-foreign-currency-transactions-at-retail-banks-11578593249) [municipal governments alike, having](https://www.crn.com/news/security/connectwise-tool-used-as-entry-point-in-texas-ransomware-attack)\n[claimed 12.5% of the ransomware market share as of Q2 2019. By mid-May of this year, the](https://www.fidelissecurity.com/threatgeek/threat-intelligence/ransomware-post-gandcrab/)\n[threat actor behind REvil announced that it had infiltrated a major entertainment law firm’s](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/criminal-group-hacked-law-firm-threatens-release-trump-documents-n1208366)\ncomputer systems, and threatened to release information on U.S. President Donald Trump if\nthey did not receive a $42 million ransom. In this way, the REvil ransomware gang - now\n[reportedly considered a terrorist organization by the FBI - has become more than just a](https://pagesix.com/2020/05/14/la-law-firm-hackers-double-ransom-demand-threaten-donald-trump/)\nhacking collective. REvil now dominates the threat ecosystem as the ultimate extortionist\ncartel.\n\nThe recently reported attack against Grubman Shire Meiselas & Sacks was merely the latest\nin a series of high-profile ransomware incidents perpetrated by the group. In early June, for\n[instance, REvil attempted to auction off data from Agromart Group, a Canadian agricultural](https://www.cpomagazine.com/cyber-security/revil-ransomwares-stolen-data-auction-sets-precarious-precedent-amid-pandemic/)\ncompany; in mid-May, it was [announced that REvil had attacked Sherwood Food](https://cybriant.com/revil-ransomware-hackers-are-ramping-up-efforts/)\nDistributors, a food distribution company based in Detroit. Notably, REvil (as well as some\nother ransomware groups, such as Ragnarok) has proven particularly receptive to Citrix and\nremote desktop protocol (RDP) exploits, a tool, technique, and procedure (TTP) we will delve\ninto later in this report. For REvil to have reached its level of notoriety and impact, however, it\nrequired more than just technical talent. Fortunately for REvil and unfortunately for their\nvictims, the collective adopted a practice from their predecessor, GandCrab - reliance on\ndecentralized criminal networks.\n\n[In our previous reports, we observed how the GandCrab group revolutionized ransomware,](https://www.advanced-intel.com/post/digital-pharmacusa-part-ii-the-gandcrab-paradigm-shift)\nleveraging major criminal networks to conduct its activities. REvil has followed the same\npath. Their representative(s), known across the DarkWeb by the alias “UNKN”, does not act\nalone: they partner with other threat actors to bolster their own capabilities.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Force Multiplier Sheriff : An Expert In the Financial Sector & Citrix Breaches**\n\n[REvil has been explicitly interested in recruiting top talent on the DarkWeb since Fall 2019.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/sodinokibi-ransomware-builds-an-all-star-team-of-affiliates/)\nSpecifically, they were endorsed and supported by a hacker who uses the alias “Kerberos”;\nwe delve into “Kerberos” and their activities later in this report. “Kerberos” is a breach\nspecialist and REvil’s connection with the actor fits into a late-2019 trend, in which\nransomware groups and breach specialists collaborated in an effort to maximize profits.\n\nRecently, REvil has deepened their cooperation with members of the criminal underground,\nrecruiting specialized experts as force-multipliers for their enterprise. One of their main\naccomplices operates under the alias “Sheriff”; they are a rising star of the Russian-speaking\nunderground and specialize in attacks against banks, financial institutions, and government\nagencies.\n\nSheriff’s main TTPs center on the use of brute-forcing (a method that relies on software to\nguess many passwords, in the hopes of gaining access to an account) and credentialstealing malware. Historically, “Sheriff” has navigated compromised networks and admin\npanels and then exfiltrated data using SQL injections (a web-based attack reliant on\nnefarious code written in the SQL database querying language) and cross-site scripting\n(XSS) (an attack that targets victims’ web browsers). In their interactions with REvil,\nhowever, “Sheriff” has likely limited their activity to selling access to victims’ networks; REvil\nlikely uses this access to perform the actual data encryption and exfiltration.\n\nIn the past, Sheriff’s targets have included a major investment fund ($10 billion in assets)\nand a private U.S. security company. Over the last couple of weeks, they have actively\nexploited the Citrix remote desktop protocol (RDP), and advertised access to a number of\nhigh-profile/high-revenue entities, including several universities in Australia, Canada, and the\nUnited States; companies focused on security, long-distance passenger transportation,\nwarehouse materials, and cloud computing; and a “famous” European capital and cities in\nSpain and France.\n\nEarlier in June, “Sheriff” boasted Citrix RDP access to a European construction company\nfocused on oil projects, as well as access to 3,200 Cpanel accounts. Moreover, in May,\n“Sheriff” advertised administrative access to an e-commerce entity’s WordPress plugin, as\n\n\n-----\n\nwell as access to approximately 815,000 orders, and information on signatures, discounts,\nbonuses,” and “gifts”. Most recently, on July 6, 2020, “Sheriff” offered access to 62,000 eToro\naccounts.\n\n[As mentioned previously, “Sheriff” often pursues Citrix credentials to gain access to victims’](https://www.citrix.com/)\nnetworks. RDP, when used for non-illicit means, can serve as a useful way for information\ntechnology (IT) teams to access computer systems and diagnose problems. When used\nnefariously, however, RDP can allow unauthorized users to claim administrative control over\na victim’s computer system or associated network. There have been numerous instances –\nparticularly in recent months – in which nefarious actors have taken advantage of Citrix\nexploits.\n\n[In January 2020, for example, it was reported that the Ragnarok ransomware group had](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/01/nice-try-501-ransomware-not-implemented.html)\ntaken advantage of one such exploit, leading to attacks on dozens of FireEye customers.\nThere have also been recorded instances of REvil using Citrix exploits in ransomware\nattacks, such as [one against “German car parts manufacturer Gedia Automotive Group”.](https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/citrix-flaw-exploited-by/)\nConsidering “Sheriff” and REvil’s interaction in May 2020 (see below), “Sheriff’s” focus on\nCitrix exploits, and REvil’s previous use of such exploits, we assess that REvil is likely to use\nCitrix exploits again in future attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Image 1. UNKN, the head of REvil enters in an underground auction to purchase SHERIFF's_\n_with paying the Blitz (a price significantly higher than the initial bid price) and advice the other_\n_auction participates to not attempt to compete with them on this bid_\n\n“Sherrif’s” interactions with REvil, however, likely go beyond the group’s “UNKN” alias. REvil\nhas also likely contacted “Sheriff” under the name, “unknown”. “UNKN’s” increasing notoriety\nled to the deletion of REvil’s threats against President Trump on major DarkWeb forums.\nREvil may be using the “unknown” alias as a new identity in the wake of their “unmasking”.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe have identified this new alias in communications with Sheriff . Assuming unknown is a\nnew alias for REvil, “Sheriff’s” interactions with “unknown” are notable, given both threat\nactors’ notoriety and previous activity in the cybercriminal underground.\n\n\n-----\n\nImage 2: SHERIFF communicates with a possible alternative alias of REvil in order to\nprocess a high-profile access\n“Sheriff” is a high-profile threat actor focused on Citrix; their interactions with REvil amplify\nthe ransomware group’s threat to entities employing this kind of software, which is ubiquitous\nand widely used. Users of Citrix with RDP must remain wary of the software’s vulnerabilities,\n[be prepared to patch them when available and monitor and review network perimeters for](https://www.advanced-intel.com/post/achilles-hacker-behind-attacks-on-military-shipbuilders-unicef-international-corporations)\nany externally-exposed RDP servers.\n\n**Force Multiplier “energydrinkkk”: Expert In Attacks Against the Energy Sector**\n\nREvil has also proven closely aff0iliated with “Kerberos”, a high-profile threat actor who has\nendorsed REvil directly. “Kerberos” is active on the top-tier Russian-language forum, posting\nads for coders and solicitations for access to various firms’ networks/financial information.\nNotably, “Kerberos’” victim list includes a hospital, which follows a worrisome trend:\nhealthcare organizations have seen an uptick in attacks amidst the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nMoreover, “Kerberos”, likely an affiliate of REvil, has interacted with “energydrinkkk”, an\nunderground threat actor who targets companies in the energy industry. “Energydrinkkk”\nrecently posted a solicitation offering RDP access to a United Arab Emirates/Canada-based\nenergy company’s Microsoft Online workspace. “Energydrinkkk’s” RDWeb exploit allegedly\nprovides access to a company engineer’s workspace on Microsoft Online, which houses\ninternal communications, as well as information on company contracts and purchases.\n“Energydrinkkk” also claimed to be able to access company email, accessible through\nemployees’ personal computers. “Energydrinkkk” also alleges to have copied passwords and\napproximately 400 pieces of contact information (including postal addresses, names, and\ntelephone numbers).\n\nOn May 8th, “Energydrinkkk” expressed a desire to enable a ransomware attack against the\ncompany, and “Kerberos” – again, a likely affiliate of REvil – has subsequently responded in\nkind; “Kerberos” posted on May 20th that they were interested in buying “Energydrinkkk’s”\naccess for $1,500.\n\n\n-----\n\nImage 3: SHERIFF is one of the leading hackers in the Russian-speaking community\nspecializing on RDP and Citrix\n\n\n-----\n\nBoth Kerberos and Sheriff have expressed interest in RDP exploits. Kerberos, likely\nacting on behalf of REvil, has attempted to purchase such exploits; “Sheriff”, meanwhile, has\nsold such exploits to REvil. Given the fact that both “Sheriff” and “Kerberos” maintain interest\nin RDP attacks – particularly those targeting energy-focused companies – and considering\nthat both threat actors have recently interacted with known/likely representatives of REvil\nransomware, AdvIntel assesses that REvil poses a threat to the energy sector, in particular.\n\nImage 4: A high-profile REvil affiliate purchases SHERIFF Citrix access.\nThe threat actors’ other solicitations have focused on the e-commerce, financial, and\nhealthcare industries, and as a result, AdvIntel believes that REvil poses a credible threat to\nthese industries, as well. It should be noted, however, that the threat REvil poses to victims\n[goes beyond data encryption; REvil has been known to exfiltrate data to a public-facing blog,](https://krebsonsecurity.com/)\nindicating that even prepared with data backups, companies can still risk reputational\ndamage in the event of an attack.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nREvil’s recent activities in the cybercriminal underground significantly alter the ransomware\nthreat landscape.\n\n\n-----\n\nIts interactions with high-profile threat actors suggest a preference to work as part of a\n[network intrusion-focused criminal syndicate, which is an entirely novel business model to a](https://www.advanced-intel.com/post/netwalker-ransomware-group-enters-advanced-targeting-game)\nRussian-speaking ransomware community historically reliant on mass spearphishing. The\ngroup’s interactions with top-tier threat actors such as “Sheriff” and “Kerberos” indicate a\nproclivity for RDP exploits, particularly in the energy sector, but also in finance, security, and\neducation. Given REvil’s targets’ prominence and large revenue streams, it appears that\nREvil is now aiming for high-profile, high-reward attacks in critical industries.\n\nHere are some possible steps entities can take to prevent attacks and mitigate\nconsequences from REvil related breaches:\n\n1. entities whose data/networks have already been compromised must notify users of the\n\nbreach;\n\n2. companies must ensure reliable backups of all system files and communications;\n\n3. administrator rights should only be granted to users who absolutely require it;\n\n4. antivirus software – as well as its source databases – must be updated to the latest\n\nversion, and used to verify programs before executing them;\n\n5. access to unused system directories must be restricted; and\n\n6. firewalls must be installed on user workstations to filter incoming connections.\n\nREvil has gained substantial notoriety in the cybersecurity world, both for its connections to\nGandCrab malware and for its own nefarious activities in the criminal underground. After\nlikely learning from GandCrab on how to organize extended criminal networks, REvil is now\nenabled by other threat actors such as “Sheriff”, who sells its network access, and\n“Kerberos”, who allows REvil the privilege of its endorsement (and possibly, its affiliation).\n\nIn this way, REvil and the actors it interacts with form a cohesive, underground economy, in\nwhich victims – and the data they own – are the main commodity.\n\n_UPDATE: Image 1 of this report has been updated to correct a technical error. Image 1_\n_illustrates that REvil does not only communicate with SHERIFF but is willing to pay a top_\n_price in order to purchase underground auction bids offered by this threat actor._\n\n\n-----",
