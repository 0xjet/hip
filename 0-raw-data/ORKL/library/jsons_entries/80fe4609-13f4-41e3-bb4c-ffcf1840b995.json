I extracted the Trickbot binary located in a pcap from the\n[Any.run analysis of the associated malicious Word document.](https://app.any.run/tasks/cf13cf3f-db73-410c-b8a4-568fc3dcd45b)\n\nThe chain of events led from the email to --> link to a Word document --> enable Word\ndocument macro --> Smoke Loader --> Trickbot.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Shown above: Trickbot binary extracted from the Any.run pcap._\n\nI wanted to see what the Trickbot binary was doing, since I haven't looked at it in a while.\nThis blog post only reviews traffic and artifacts from a Windows host infected with the\nTrickbot binary, SHA256 hash\n[91f78068e996b1b32a3539746b6b683f5fa40e7be009b779c56e215b521df6c5.](https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/91f78068e996b1b32a3539746b6b683f5fa40e7be009b779c56e215b521df6c5/community)\n\n## TRICKBOT TRAFFIC\n\nTrickbot network traffic in February 2018 are similar to what I in this ISC diary I wrote in\nAugust 2017. The only difference is a Monero cryptocurrency miner (coin miner) in postinfection traffic in February 2018, which I hadn't noticed before.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Shown above: Trickbot traffic (from the Trickbot binary) on 2018-02-01._\n\nTrickbot SSL traffic is somewhat similar to what we've seen with Dridex SSL traffic in recent\nweeks. Today's Trickbot traffic triggered Emerging Threats alerts for ET TROJAN\nABUSE.CH SSL Blacklist Malicious SSL certificates detected (Dridex CnC), which I've seen\nwith Trickbot traffic before. More importantly, rules from the Snort subscriber's ruleset\ndetected Trickbot SSL certificates, which better fits what I saw on 2018-02-01.\n\n_Shown above: Snort alerts on Trickbot certificates in SSL traffic._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Shown above: Emerging Threats alerts on the infection traffic from Sguil using_\n_Suricata on Security Onion._\n\n_Shown above: Post-infection traffic caused by malware based on Monero (XMRig)_\n_coin miner._\n\n## FORENSICS ON THE INFECTED WINDOWS HOST\n\nMy Trickbot binary was named 2018-02-01-Trickbot-malware-sample.exe, and I ran it from\nthe user's AppData\\Local\\Temp directory. As we saw with Trickbot back in August 2017,\nthe malware copied itself to a new folder in the user's AppData\\Roaming directory. Today's\nfile was re-named, with some (but not all) of the characters in the file name shifted one\ncharacter. Like we saw back in August 2017, there's a file named group_tag. This time, it\ncontained the text: 3101uk. Below are images showing some of the artifacts.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Shown above: Artifacts on the infected Windows host._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Shown above: Per @VK_Intel, decoded Worm32Dll module is a Monero coin miner_\n_[(link).](https://twitter.com/VK_Intel/status/959194022735523841)_\n\n## FINAL WORDS\n\nLooks like Trickbot has changed a bit since I last examined it. Traffic and artifacts familiar,\nbut Trickbot has apparently jumped on the cryptocurrency bandwagon by adding a Monero\n(XMRig) coin mining module. I imagine someone will do a more in-depth write-up on the\nnew Trickbot, but I wanted to get some traffic and malware samples out.\n\nOnce again, here are the associated files:\n\n\n-----\n\n[Zip archive of the pcaps: 2018-02-01-Trickbot-infection-traffic.pcap.zip  9.5 MB](http://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/2018/02/01/2018-02-01-Trickbot-infection-traffic.pcap.zip)\n(9,472,261 bytes)\n[Zip archive of the malware: 2018-02-01-Trickbot-malware-samples.zip  542 kB](http://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/2018/02/01/2018-02-01-Trickbot-malware-samples.zip)\n(541,817 bytes)\n\nAll zip archives are password-protected with the standard password.
