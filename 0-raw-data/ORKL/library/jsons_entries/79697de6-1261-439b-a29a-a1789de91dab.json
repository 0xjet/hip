In the Preliminary Injunction Motion,\n\nMicrosoft seeks ex parte relief to disable the recently registered domains set forth in\n\n**Appendix** A to the Complaint. That will cease the irreparable harm resulting from\n\nDefendants’ conduct. Microsoft seeks relief under seal, with respect to the portion of the\n\nOrder disabling the domains in **Appendix** A to the Complaint, because advance public\n\ndisclosure or notice of that requested relief would allow Defendants to evade such relief and\n\n1\n\n\n-----\n\nfurther prosecution of this action, thereby perpetuating the irreparable harm at issue. The\n\nreasons for Microsoft’s request are set forth in detail in the Preliminary Injunction Motion\n\nfiled concurrently herewith. Therefore, Microsoft requests that the Ex Parte Motion to\n\nSupplement Preliminary Injunction Order and associated pleadings be sealed pending\n\nexecution of the ex parte relief sought in Microsoft’s Preliminary Injunction Order, in\n\nparticular disabling of the domains set forth in **Appendix** **A** to the Complaint. Microsoft’s\n\nrequested sealing order is narrowly tailored to impose the least restriction on the public’s\n\nright of access to information as possible. Microsoft requests that all sealed documents be\n\nimmediately unsealed upon execution of the portion of the Order disabling the domains set\n\nforth in **Appendix** **A** to the Complaint. As soon as that relief is executed, all papers will be\n\nmade available on the public docket.\n\n###### ARGUMENT\n\nThe right of access to court records is not absolute. _Nixon_ v. _Warner_ _Commc_ _'ns,_ _Inc.,_ 435\n\nU.S. 589, 597-98 (1978). Although both common law and the First Amendment afford the public\n\na qualified right of access to judicial proceedings. _In_ _re_ _Fort_ _Totten_ _Metrorail_ _Cases,_ 960 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 2, 5 (D.C. Cir. 2013), the D.C. Circuit has expressed doubts about whether the First\n\nAmendment right of access applies outside of the criminal context. _SEC_ v. _Am._ _Int’l_ _Grp.,_ 712\n\nF.3d 1,5 (D.C. Cir. 2013); _Ctr._ _for_ _Nat’I_ _Sec._ _Studies_ _v._ _DOJ,_ 331 F.3d 918, 935 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2003); _In_ _re_ _Reporters_ _Comm,_ _for_ _Freedom_ _ofthe_ _Press,_ 773 F.2d 1325, 1337 (D.C. Cir. 1985)\n\n(Scalia, J.) (doubting that the benefits of open criminal trials inure to civil suits between private\n\nparties).\n\nCompeting interests may outweigh the public’s common law right of access to judicial\n\nrecords. _United_ _States_ _v._ _Hubbard,_ 650 F.2d 293, 317-22 (D.C. Cir. 1980). Indeed, “[a] district\n\n2\n\n\n-----\n\ncourt has authority to seal and unseal documents as part of its ‘supervisory power over its own\n\nrecords and files. 995 United _Stales_ v. _Ring,_ 47 F. Supp. 3d 38, 40 (D.D.C. 2014) (quoting _Nixon_ _v._\n\n_Warner_ _Commons,_ _Inc.,_ 435 U.S. 589, 598 (1978)); _In_ _re_ _Nat’l_ _Broad._ _Co.,_ 653 F.2d 609, 613\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1981) (“Because of the difficulties inherent in formulating a broad yet clear rule to\n\ngovern the variety of situations in which the right of access must be reconciled with legitimate\n\ncountervailing public or private interests, the decision as to access is one which rests in the sound\n\ndiscretion of the trial court.”).\n\nUnder D.C. Circuit law, the district court should weigh the following when presented with\n\na motion to seal or unseal: “(1) the need for public access to the documents at issue; (2) the extent\n\n###### of previous public access to the documents; (3) the fact that someone has objected to disclosure,\n\nand the identity of that person; (4) the strength of any property and privacy interests asserted; (5)\n\nthe possibility of prejudice to those opposing disclosure; and (6) the purposes for which the\n\ndocuments were introduced during the judicial proceedings.” _Hubbard,_ 650 F.2d at 317-22;\n\n_Metlife,_ _Inc._ v. _Fin._ _Stability_ _Oversight_ _Council,_ 865 F.3d 661, 666 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (Garland,\n\nC.J.) (“[T]he Flubbard test has consistently served as our lodestar because it ensures that we fully\n\naccount for the various public and private interests at stake.”).\n\nThe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure also recognize the important public and judicial\n\ninterest in protecting confidential business information. _See_ Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(c)(1)(G)\n\n(empowering courts to order “that a trade secret or other confidential research, development, or\n\ncommercial information not be revealed or be revealed only in a specified way”). Likewise,\n\nSupreme Court and D.C. Circuit authority recognize the necessity of non-public ex parte\n\nproeeedings. _See_ _Granny_ _Goose_ _Foods,_ _Inc._ v. _Teamsters,_ 415 U.S. 423, 439, 94 S. Ct. 1113\n\n(1974) (“Ex parte temporary restraining orders are no doubt necessary in certain\n\n3\n\n\n-----\n\ncircumstances...”); _Carroll_ _v._ _President_ _and_ _Com’rs_ _ofPrincess_ _Anne,_ 393 U.S. 175, 180 (1968)\n\n(“There is a place in our jurisprudence for ex parte issuance, without notice, of temporary\n\nrestraining orders.”); _Omar_ v. _Harvey,_ 2006 WL 286861, at *1 (D.D.C. Feb. 6, 2006) (holding\n\nthat an ex parte restraining order is appropriate where plaintiff demonstrates notice would render\n\nfruitless further prosecution of the action); _Council_ _on_ _American-Islamic_ _Relations_ v. _Gaubatz,_\n\n667 F. Supp. 2d 67, 75 (D.D.C. Nov. 3, 2009) (noting that ex parte restraining orders may be\n\nappropriate in circumstances where notice is impossible).\n\nIn this case, Microsoft’s rights and interests in protecting its ability to obtain ex parte\n\ntemporary relief, and the necessity of sealing its pleadings in order to effectively disable the\n\ndomains in **Appendix** A to the Complaint, is paramount over any competing public interest to\n\n_immediate_ access to the information Microsoft requests be sealed. If Microsoft’s papers are not\n\nsealed, the relief sought would very likely be rendered fruitless, and there is a substantial risk\n\nDefendants would destroy evidence. Defendants are highly-sophisticated cybercriminals. They\n\naccess Microsoft’s services without authorization; hack into high-value computer networks;\n\ninstall malware on the networks to gain and maintain long-term, surreptitious access to that\n\nnetwork; and locate and exfiltrate sensitive information off of the networks. _See_ Preliminary\n\nInjunction Motion, filed contemporaneously herewith. If Defendants knew Microsoft sought the\n\nrelief set forth in the Preliminary Injunction Motion, they could quickly adapt the command and\n\ncontrol infrastructure used to secretly establish themselves on a victim’s network. _Id._ at 14.\n\nIn fact. Defendants have shown that this is their intention. Defendants continue to misuse\n\nMicrosoft’s trademarks and brand names to make their domains seem legitimate. Declaration of\n\nDavid Anselmi In Support Of Microsoft’s Motion to Supplement Preliminary Injunction Order\n\n(“Anselmi Deck”) ^ 4, set forth at **Appendix** **B** to this Brief Given Microsoft’s actions against\n\n4\n\n\n-----\n\nDefendants in this case, even disclosing that Microsoft has filed a Preliminary Injunction Motion\n\ngives Defendants the opportunity to change their command and control infrastructure, set forth at\n\n**Appendix** **A** to the Complaint.\n\nAdditionally, evidence shows that when the Phosphorus defendants become aware of\n\nefforts to mitigate or investigate their activities, they take steps to conceal their activities and to\n\nconceal the injury caused to their victims, making it more difficult for their victims to adequately\n\nassess the damage or take steps to mitigate that injury going forward. _Id._ ^ 32. For example, once\n\nDefendants become aware that domains in Phosphorus’ active infrastructure become known to\n\nthe security community, they abandon that infrastructure and move to new infrastructure that is\n\nused to continue their efforts to intrude upon the computers of existing victims and new victims.\n\n_Id._ In the last five years, Microsoft has brought similar cases against John Doe defendants who\n\nhave been conducting illegal activities through identifiable but movable infrastructures on the\n\nInternet very similar to that used by Phosphorus. Declaration of Gabriel M. Ramsey In Support\n\n###### Of Motion For Protective Order (“Ramsey Deck”) f 5, set forth at Appendix C to this Brief In\n\nfour of those cases, the defendants immediately attempted to either destroy evidence or move\n\ntheir command and control infrastructure upon detecting the legal action being taken against\n\nthem. _Id._ This underscores the risk that the Defendants in this case will take similar steps to\n\ndestroy evidence and move their command and control infrastructure in **Appendix** **A** if they are\n\ngiven notice of the Preliminary Injunction Motion. _Id._ ^ 6.\n\nThe harm that would be caused by the public filing of Microsoft’s Preliminary Injunction\n\nMotion would far outweigh the public’s right to access that information. There is no need for the\n\npublic to have immediate access to the Preliminary Injunction Motion and supporting documents\n\nwhile Microsoft is seeking ex parte relief with respect to the domains in **Appendix** **A** to the\n\n5\n\n\n-----\n\nComplaint, which will only be effective if these materials remain under seal. Applying the\n\nbalancing test set forth in governing law demonstrates that Microsoft’s interest in obtaining\n\neffective relief outweigh any immediate public right to disclosure.\n\nMicrosoft only seeks to seal such information for a limited period of time, until after\n\neffective ex parte temporary relief has been obtained, disabling the domains in **Appendix** **A** to\n\nthe Complaint. After such point, sealing will no longer be necessary, and Microsoft will\n\nImmediately commence efforts to provide Defendants notice of future hearings and service of\n\nrelated pleadings—at which point, all documents will be unsealed and the public will be given\n\nfull access to these proceedings. Microsoft, upon execution of the ex parte relief disabling the\n\ndomains in **Appendix** **A** to the Complaint, will file with the Clerk of the Court a Notice that the\n\ntemporary restraining order has been executed. The Clerk of the Court may then file all\n\ndocuments related to this request on the public docket.\n\nShould, however, the Court decide not to grant the ex parte relief Microsoft requests,\n\nMicrosoft asks that such materials remain sealed for an indefinite period, as public disclosure or\n\nnotice absent the ex parte relief requested would facilitate Defendants’ harmful and malicious\n\nInternet activities.\n\nGiven the limited period of sealing as an alternative that balances the public interest in\n\naccess with Microsoft’s important interests in maintaining these materials under seal for a brief\n\nperiod of time, granting the instant request to seal is warranted and consistent with the legal\n\nframework for addressing this issue.\n\n6\n\n\n-----\n\nDated: March 14, 2019 Respectfully submitted,\n\n###### /s/ Julia R.

**OF**\n**MICROSOFT’S** **APPLICATION** **FOR** **AN** **EMERGENCY** **EX** **PARTE** **TEMPORARY**\n**RESTRAINING** **ORDER** **AND** **ORDER** **TO** **SHOW** **CAUSE** **RE** **PRELIMINARY**\n**INJUNCTION**\n\nI, David Anselmi, declare as follows:\n\n1. I am a Senior Investigator in the Digital Crimes Unit of Microsoft Corporation’s\n\nLegal and Corporate Affairs Group. I make this declaration in support of Microsoft’s application\n\nfor an Emergency Ex Parte Temporary Restraining Order And Order To Show Cause Re\n\nPreliminary Injunction. I make this declaration of my own personal knowledge and, if called as\n\na witness, I could and would testify competently to the truth of the matters set forth herein.\n\n2. In my current role at Microsoft, I assess technical security threats to Microsoft\n\nand the impact of such threats on Microsoft’s business and customers. Prior to my current role, I\n\nworked as Senior Technologist, dealing with security of Microsoft’s online services. Among my\n\nresponsibilities were protecting Microsoft’s customer-facing online service assets from network-\n\nbased attacks. Prior to that, while also employed by Microsoft, I worked as a Senior\n\nTechnologist, dealing with protecting Microsoft’s corporate resources from network-based\n\n1\n\n\n-----\n\nattacks. Before joining Microsoft, I worked for Excell Data Corporation as a Program Manager\n\nperforming security firewall deployment, configuration, and administration. I am a graduate of\n\nthe United States Military Academy, West Point, and served for 27 years as a United States\n\nArmy Communications Electronics Officer (11 years active, 16 years reserve), attaining the rank\n\n###### of Lieutenant Colonel. I have been employed by Microsoft since February 1997.\n\n**I.** **OVERVIEW** **OF** **INVESTIGATION** **INTO** **PHOSPHORUS** **AND** **CONCLUSIONS**\n\n3. My declaration concerns an organization that is engaged in systematic criminal\n\nactivity on the Internet. Because the identities of the individuals behind the activity addressed in\n\nthis declaration are unknown, I therefore refer to them collectively by the codename that\n\nMicrosoft has assigned to this group: “Phosphorus.” Others in the security community who\n\nhave researched this group of actors refer to the group by other names, including “APT 35,”\n\n“Charming Kitten,” and “Ajax Security Team.” The defendants have been linked to an Iranian\n\nhacking group or groups. I have investigated the infrastructure described in this declaration and\n\nhave determined that the defendants have registered Internet domains using fictitious names and\n\nfictitious physical addresses that are purportedly located in multiple cities and countries.\n\nDefendants have registered domains using functioning email addresses by whieh they\n\ncommunicated with domain registrars in order to complete the registration process.\n\n4. Microsoft investigators have been monitoring and gathering information on the\n\nPhosphorus defendants. In the course of such investigation, I have been working with and\n\ndirecting a team that (1) engaged in the analysis and creation of “signatures” (which can be\n\nthought of as digital fingerprints) for the infrastructure used by the Phosphorus defendants, (2)\n\ndiscovered login activity into Microsoft services from Phosphorus-controlled infrastructure on\n\nthe Internet, (3) matched reported Phosphorus phishing email campaigns to registered domains,\n\n(4) monitored domain registrations associated with the Phosphorus-controlled email addresses\n\nand other pertinent WHOIS record information, (5) monitored infrastructure frequently utilized\n\nby the Phosphorus defendants in order to identify new domains being registered by the\n\nPhosphorus defendants, (6) have confirmed resolution settings to particular Internet service\n\n2\n\n\n-----\n\nproviders (ISPs) which have frequently been used by the Phosphorus defendants in the past, and\n\n(7) reviewed peer findings and public reporting on the Phosphorus defendants.\n\n5. As alluded in paragraph 4(1), the investigative team has developed methods to\n\nhelp us identify new domains registered by the Phosphorus actors. Particular features of the\n\nPhosphorus infrastructure have been identified and patterns of content, non-content, and\n\ntechnical features have been determined to be exclusively and specifically associated with the\n\nPhosphorus defendants. These features, when identified in the aggregate, provide a high level of\n\nconfidence that a given domain is a Phosphorus domain. Each such domain is manually\n\nreviewed in detail by one or more subject matter experts as necessary to ascertain whether it is,\n\nin fact, a Phosphorus domain. Based on this analysis, we have identified characteristics of the\n\nregistration and maintenance of certain domains which, when coupled with the nature of the\n\nactivities observed being carried out through the domains, are a reliable method to correlate such\n\ndomains to actions undertaken by the defendants.\n\n6. Based on our investigation and analysis, Microsoft has determined that the\n\nPhosphorus defendants specialize in targeting and stealing credentials of prominent users of the\n\nInternet. The Phosphorus defendants target Microsoft and non-Microsoft customers in both the\n\nprivate and public sectors, including businesses in a variety of different industries. Based on our\n\nresearch, the Phosphorus defendants have targeted Microsoft customers, political dissidents,\n\nactivist leaders, the Defense Industrial Base (DIB), journalists, and employees from multiple\n\ngovernment agencies, including individuals protesting oppressive regimes in the Middle East.\n\nFor example, attached as **Exhibit** **1** is a true and correct copy of a research report by security\n\nresearch firm FireEye regarding the Phosphorus group (which that firm has called “Ajax Security\n\nTeam”).\n\n7. The Phosphorus defendants’ objectives appear to be obtaining account credentials\n\nto later retrieve sensitive communications within the accounts. We believe that the Phosphorus\n\ndefendants have been active since 2013 and continue to pose a threat today and into the future.\n\n**II.** **PHOSPHORUS’** **METHOD** **OF** **COMPROMISING** **AND** **STEALING**\n\n**3**\n\n\n-----\n\n**INFORMATION** **FROM** **VICTIMS**\n\n8. The Phosphorus defendants typically attempt to compromise the personal (not\n\nwork) accounts of the targeted individuals through a technique known as “spear phishing.”\n\nSpear phishing attacks are conducted in the following fashion: After researching a victim\n\norganization, the spear phisher will identify individuals associated with that organization through\n\ngathering publicly available information and by social engineering. The spear phisher will then\n\ninitiate communications with the victim by using names, companies, and/or contents that are\n\nfamiliar to the victim. The ensuing communications exchanges are used to social engineer\n\ninformation, identify additional targets, entice a target into opening up a malicious attachment,\n\nand more. Microsoft has observed fake social networking profiles being created by Phosphorus\n\ndefendants which would obviously present significant leverage in carrying out such an attack.\n\nAttached as **Exhibit** **2** are true and correct copies of such fake social networking profiles, created\n\nby the Phosphorus defendants on the Linkedin social media service.\n\n9. Another technique utilized by the Phosphorus defendants is to send a targeted\n\nindividual an email speeifically crafted to appear as if there is an issue with the targeted\n\nindividual’s account. Phishing emails often use generic domain names that appear to be tied to\n\naccount activity and that require input of credentials for authentication. For example, domains\n\nsuch as service-accountrecoverv.com. The Phosphorus defendants send the targeted individual\n\nan email specifically crafted to appear as if there is an issue with the targeted individual’s\n\naccount. Through research and investigation, Microsoft has determined that the Phosphorus\n\ndefendants have used the domains listed in **Exhibit** **3** (which is also reflected as **Appendix** **A** to\n\nthe Complaint) in its command and control infrastructure. As can be seen in **Exhibit** **3,** the\n\nPhosphorus defendants sometimes also disguise their command and control domains by\n\nincorporating the names and trademarks of some well-known companies and organizations,\n\nincluding Microsoft’s “Microsoft” and Windows “Live” brands, as well as the “Linkedin” brand.\n\nFor example, the Phosphorus defendants use the domains com-microsoftonline.club. verification-\n\nlive.com. and verifv-linkedin.net.\n\n4\n\n\n-----\n\n10. The Phosphorus defendants’ use of Microsoft trademarks is meant to confuse\n\nvictims into clicking on links controlled by the Phosphorus defendants. When the user clicks on\n\nthe links, they are taken to deceptive web pages that induce the victim to type in their Microsoft\n\ncredentials, at which point the Phosphorus defendants obtain access to those credentials. This\n\nwill result in the threat actors being able to log into the victim’s account and access their email.\n\nThe Phosphorus defendants can also download a copy of the victim’s address book to be used for\n\nfuture targeting of additional intended victims. Not having safe emails impacts Microsoft’s\n\nbrands and services. Customers expect Microsoft to provide safe and trustworthy products and\n\nservices. There is a great risk that Microsoft’s customers, both individuals and the enterprises\n\nfor which they work, may incorrectly attribute these problems to Microsoft’s products and\n\nservices, thereby diluting and tarnishing the value of these trademarks and brands.\n\n11. The Phosphorus defendants send these emails from a variety of online email\n\nservices. As discussed above, there are multiple Phosphorus created domains mimicking\n\nMicrosoft brands, and those domains are clearly designed to be included in spear phishing emails\n\nas links to websites that the Phosphorus defendants have set up in advance and which they\n\ncontrol. When a victim clicks on the link in the email, his or her computer is connected with the\n\nPhosphorus-controlled website. The victim is then presented a copy of a webpage that appears to\n\nbe a login page for a webmail provider of which the victim is a subscriber. In fact, this is a fake\n\nlogin page that is designed to induce the user to type in their webmail credentials. If the victim\n\nenters the correct credentials, at that point the Phosphorus actors obtain the user’s credentials and\n\ncan thereafter access the user’s webmail account to steal email content and other information.\n\n12. **Figures** **1** **and** **2** below show copies of such webpages created by the Phosphorus\n\ndefendants, designed to look like legitimate Microsoft Outlook login pages;\n\n5\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Outlook Web App\n\n                                                                                                           - ’■ **:1** inni.r                                                                                                            -\n###### r :j p!'!' .t rn;:u: cr r I, li-ir -f\n\n                                                                - ■r _n_                                                                - ii'\n\nj\n\nI'l r/ii 'T **•»** '.i\ncro:.:lt _v\\:>_                                           - j\n\n###### Figure 1\n\n3^\n\n#■\n**E**\n\n###### Figure 2\n\n6\n\n\n-----\n\n13. Phosphorus targets other brands beyond Microsoft and purport to be password\n\nreset or account login pages of other companies. For example, the Phosphorus defendants use\n\nfake emails instructing users to click links and type in credentials, fake “Verify” buttons\n\nprompting users to type their credentials into fraudulent login pages and fake “Sign in” pages\n\ninstructing users to enter their user name and password. All of these methods are designed to\n\ninduce users to type in credentials. As seen above with respect to the fake Microsoft login pages\n\ninviting users to type in their Microsoft Outlook “User name” and “Password,” this scheme is\n\ntypical of the Phosphorus defendants’ activities. **Figures** **3** through 6 are further examples of\n\nthis tactic:\n\n**Figure** **3**\n\n**7**\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Figure 4\n\n**o**\n\n###### One account.

Upon successful compromise of a victim account, the Phosphorus defendants will\n\nnot only be able to log into the account and review the victim’s emails, but may also delete the\n\nspear phishing email that they previously sent to the user in an attempt to obfuscate their\n\nactivities.\n\n15. The Phosphorus defendants have targeted victims who are using Microsoft email\n\nservices, and Microsoft investigators have confirmed that Phosphorus defendants have intruded\n\ninto those accounts to steal information of Microsoft’s users. **Figures** **1** **and** **2** above\n\ndemonstrate the Phosphorus defendants targeting users of Microsoft’s Outlook email services.\n\n16. Microsoft investigators were also able to locate the control panel used by the\n\nPhosphorus defendants to create links sent to intended victims as well as to track successfully\n\ncompromised victims who clicked on those links, typed in their credentials and had those\n\ncredentials stolen by the defendants. Microsoft analysts identified the Phosphorus domain\n\nconfirm-session-identification.info which led to discovery of the control panel URL. This\n\ncontrol panel was accessed by a URL that was open and required no authentication. The control\n\npanel that the Phosphorus defendants used to monitor and control their access to victim accounts\n\n9\n\n\n-----\n\nwas present on the domain: confirm-session-identification.info. The domain confirm-session-\n\nidentification.info was registered on 10/17/2018 as seen in the WHOIS record from a commonly\n\nused domain research tool called Domaintools.com.

The Phosphorus defendants also intrude upon and cause injury to Microsoft and\n\nMicrosoft’s customers by damaging the customers’ computers and the software installed on their\n\ncomputers. In particular, the Phosphorus defendants have sent deceptive email messages to\n\nvictims, such as those discussed above, which include links to websites from which the\n\ndefendants install malicious software onto the victims’ computers. The defendants refer to the\n\nmalicious software as “Stealer.” Stealer, once installed, can record what the victim types on their\n\nkeyboard, take screenshots of what is on the victim’s computer screen, steal login credentials for\n\ninstant messaging account (including information about victims’ Microsoft-owned “Skype”\n\nmessaging accounts), email accounts, and other credentials. The Stealer software is installed\n\nfrom, and stolen information may be transferred to, defendants using command and control\n\ndomains such as those reflected in **Exhibit** **3.**\n\n21. The installation of this malicious software damages the victim’s computer and the\n\nWindows operating system on the victim’s computer. During the infection of a victim’s\n\ncomputer, the malicious Stealer software makes changes at the deepest and most sensitive levels\n\n###### of the computer’s Windows operating system. The consequences of these changes are that the\n\nuser’s version of Windows is essentially adulterated, and unknown to the user, has been\n\nconverted into a tool to steal credentials and sensitive information from the user. This inherently\n\ninvolves abuse of Microsoft’s trademarks and brands, and deceives users by presenting an\n\nunauthorized, modified version of Windows to those users. For example, the defendants create\n\nregistry key paths bearing the Microsoft “Windows” trademark, within the Microsoft operating\n\nsystem, including, among others:\n\n\"C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\rundll32.exe\" \"C:\\ Documents and\nSettings\\{USER}\\ApplicationData\\lntelRapidStart\\AppTransferWiz.dll\",#110\n\n22. Further, as seen in **Figure** **11** below, the Phosphorus defendants include metadata\n\nwithin the Stealer malicious software that expressly misrepresents that the software is created by\n\n“Microsoft” and that the software is a “Process for Windows.”\n\n13\n\n\n-----\n\n**File** **Version** **informiaUon**\n\nCDpyriCjh!\n\nPri;::i:<.'i-,:s ror WirKiov,:-;\n\nPro.- ‘'c.if VViricii\n\nSteaKir 0^*'\n\niMJi.CKO\n\n' _0_ ij 0\n\nProco^ P:ir V“ ,'y\n\nExifTool File Mocaaata\n\n                                                                                                                                                    - .i) 0,1)\n\n**u** ic;\n\nF^fC _(,.“■r_                                        - ifiri) 1',\n\nFicr >ft\n\nOx3c5tjlo\n\nPr!:ct;-ss fo!

PHOSPHORUS HAS ATTACKED MANY MICROSOFT CUSTOMERS IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA AND AROUND THE WORLD\n\n23. Through its investigation, Microsoft has determined that the Phosphorus\n\n###### defendants have targeted Microsoft customers in the District of Columbia and throughout the\n\n United States. In only the last few months alone, four new individual victims of the Phosphorus\n\n14\n\n\n-----\n\ndefendants’ email intrusion activities have been identified in the District of Columbia.\n\n**IV.** **HARM** **TO** **MICROSOFT** **AND** **MICROSOFT** **CUSTOMERS**\n\n24. Phosphorus irreparably harms Microsoft by damaging its reputation, brands, and\n\ncustomer goodwill. Microsoft is the provider of the Windows operating system and Outlook,\n\nHotmail, OneDrive and Office 365 email and cloud services, as well as a variety of other\n\nsoftware and services. Microsoft is the owner of the “Microsoft,” ’’Windows,” “Outlook,”\n\n###### “Windows Live,” “Hotmail,” “OneDrive” and “Office 365” trademarks. Trademark registrations\n\nfor marks infringed by the Phosphorus defendants are attached to Microsoft’s complaint as\n\n**Appendix** **B.** Microsoft has invested substantial resources in developing high-quality products\n\nand services. Microsoft has also invested, through its subsidiaries, in high value brands and\n\nservices such as the “Linkedin” brand and service. Due to the high quality and effectiveness of\n\nMicrosoft’s products and services and the expenditure of significant resources by Microsoft to\n\nmarket those products and services, Microsoft has generated substantial goodwill with its\n\ncustomers, has established a strong brand, and has developed the Microsoft name and the names\n\n###### of its products and services into strong and famous world-wide symbols that are well-recognized\n\nwithin its channels of trade. Microsoft has registered trademarks representing the quality of its\n\nproducts and service and its brand, including the trademarks listed above.\n\n25. Microsoft’s customers whose email accounts are compromised through the\n\ndefendants’ credential theft are damaged by these activities. Similarly, Microsoft’s customers\n\nwhose computers are infected with the malicious Stealer software are damaged by changes to\n\nWindows, which alter the normal and approved settings and functions of the user’s operating\n\nsystem, destabilize it, and enable unauthorized monitoring of the user and theft of user data.\n\n26. In effect, once infected, altered and controlled by the Stealer software, the\n\nWindows operating system ceases to operate normally and is now a tool of deception and theft\n\naimed at the owner of the infected computer. Yet they still bear the Microsoft Windows\n\ntrademark. This is obviously meant to mislead Microsoft’s customers, and it causes extreme\n\ndamage to Microsoft’s brands and trademarks.\n\n15\n\n\n-----\n\n27. Customers are usually unaware of the fact that their email accounts are\n\ncompromised, that their computers are infected, that they are being monitored by the defendants\n\nor that sensitive information is being stolen from them. Even if aware of an account intrusion or\n\nan infection of their computer, users often lack the technical resources or skills to resolve the\n\nproblem, allowing their accounts and computers to be misused indefinitely, as manual steps to\n\nchange account credentials or remove the malicious software may be difficult for ordinary users.\n\nThey may be futile to a degree too where the Phosphorus defendants have software installed to\n\nobserve the victim’s activities and attempts to remediate the intrusion. Even with professional\n\nassistance, cleaning an infected end-user computer can be exceedingly difficult, time-consuming,\n\nand frustrating. This demonstrates the extreme problems that the activities of the Phosphorus\n\ndefendants cause for Microsoft’s customers and the irreparable injury to both Microsoft and its\n\ncustomers. Microsoft and other members of the public must invest considerable time and\n\nresources investigating and remediating the defendants’ intrusion into accounts and computers.\n\n28. The activities of the Phosphorus defendants injure Microsoft and its reputation,\n\nbrand, and goodwill. Users subject to the negative effects of the Phosphorus defendants’ spear\n\nphishing emails sometimes incorrectly believe that Microsoft is the source of the problem, and\n\nthus there is a significant risk that Microsoft customers will be confused in this way in the future.\n\nThere is a great risk that Microsoft customers may incorrectly attribute these problems to\n\nMicrosoft and associate these problems with Microsoft’s products and services, thereby diluting\n\nand tarnishing the value of these trademarks and brands.\n\n**V.** **DISRUPTING** **PHOSPHORUS’** **ILLEGAL** **ACTIVITIES**\n\n29. The Phosphorus defendants’ illegal activities will not be easy to disrupt.\n\nEvidence indicates that the Phosphorus defendants are highly sophisticated, well-resourced,\n\norganized, and patient. The Phosphorus defendants specialize in targeting individuals in\n\norganizations holding sensitive data, by gathering extensive information about their employees\n\nthrough publicly available information and social media, using that information to fashion\n\nphishing attacks intended to trick those employees into compromising their credentials, and\n\n16\n\n\n-----\n\ndisguising its activities using the names and trademarks of Microsoft and other legitimate\n\ncompanies.\n\n30. The most vulnerable point in the Phosphorus defendants’ operations are a number\n\n###### of Internet domains through which the Phosphorus defendants obtain victim credentials, log into\n\ncompromised accounts, and review sensitive information from victim accounts. A core subset of\n\nthese is listed in **Appendix** **A** to the Complaint. These domains sometimes incorporate\n\ntrademarks that are owned by Microsoft or by other companies that have been informed of and\n\nhave no objection to Microsoft’s proposal to take possession of these domains. Granting\n\nMicrosoft possession of these domains will enable Microsoft to channel all communications to\n\nthose domains to secure servers, and thereby cut off the means by which the Phosphorus\n\ndefendants collect victim credentials. In other words, any time a user clicks on a link in a spear\n\nphishing email and provides their username and password, that information will be prevented\n\nfrom going to the defendants at the Phosphorus domains, because those domains will be hosted\n\non a Microsoft-controlled, secure server, beyond the control of defendants. While it is not\n\npossible to rule out the possibility that the Phosphorus defendants could use fall back\n\nmechanisms to evade the requested relief, redirecting this core subset of Phosphorus domains\n\nwill directly disrupt current Phosphorus infrastructure, mitigating risk and injury to Microsoft\n\nand its customers. The requested relief will also serve the public interest, in protecting\n\ncustomers of other web services companies who have consented to the relief sought in this\n\naction.\n\n31. I believe that the most effective way to suspend the injury caused to Microsoft, its\n\nconsumers, and the public, is to take the steps described in the [Proposed] Ex Parte Temporary\n\nRestraining Order and Order to show Cause Re Preliminary Injunction (“Proposed TRO”). This\n\nrelief will significantly hinder the Phosphorus defendants’ ability to compromise additional\n\naccounts and identify new potential victims to target. In the absence of such action, the\n\nPhosphorus defendants will be able to continue using this infrastructure to target new accounts,\n\nexposing potential new victims to the Phosphorus defendants’ malieious activities.\n\n17\n\n\n-----\n\n32. The Phosphorus defendants’ teehniques are designed to resist technieal mitigation\n\nefforts, eliminating easy technical means to curb the injury being caused. For example, once\n\ndomains in the Phosphorus defendants’ active infrastructure become known to the security\n\ncommunity, the defendants abandon that infrastructure and move to new infrastructure that is\n\nused to continue the Phosphorus defendants’ efforts to compromise accounts of new victims.\n\nFor this reason, providing notice to the Phosphorus defendants in advance of redirection of the\n\ndomains at issue would render attempts to disable the infrastructure futile. Further, when the\n\nPhosphorus defendants become aware of efforts to mitigate or investigate their activities, they\n\ntake steps to conceal their activities and to conceal the injury that has been caused to victims,\n\nmaking it more difficult for victims to adequately assess the damage or take steps to mitigate that\n\ninjury going forward. For this reason as well, providing notice to the Phosphorus defendants in\n\nadvance of redirection of the domains at issue would render attempts to mitigate the harm futile,\n\nor at least much more difficult for Microsoft. Piecemeal requests to disable these domains,\n\ninformal dispute resolution or notice to the defendants prior to redirecting the domains would be\n\ninsufficient to curb the injury. Based on my experience observing the operation of numerous\n\nintrusions such as those carried out by the Phosphorus defendants, and prior investigations and\n\nlegal actions involving such intrusions and actors, 1 believe that the Phosphorus defendants\n\nwould take swift preemptive action to conceal the extent of the victimization of Microsoft and its\n\ncustomers and to defend their infrastructure, if they were to learn of Microsoft’s impending\n\naction and request for relief\n\n33. I am informed and believe there have been prior instances where security\n\nresearchers or the government attempted to curb injury caused by actors carrying out intrusions\n\nsuch as those in this case, but allowed those actors to receive notice. In these cases, the actors\n\nquickly concealed the scope and nature of their intrusion, and moved the infrastructure to new,\n\nunidentified locations on the Internet and took other countermeasures causing the actors to\n\ncontinue their operations and destroying or concealing evidence of their operations. Indeed,\n\nCERTFA published a report on this actor group on December 13, 2018 **(Exhibit** **4).** Subsequent\n\n18\n\n\n-----\n\nto that report, the control panel cited in Figures 8 through 10 was updated to require\n\nauthentication. For all of these reasons, I believe that the only way to mitigate injury and disrupt\n\nthe most recent, active Phosphorus infrastructure, is to redirect the domains at issue prior to\n\nproviding notice to the defendants,\n\n34. I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United States of America\n\nthat the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.

Welcome\n\n[victim@gmail.com](mailto:victim@gmail.com) v\n\nThe Return of The Charming Kitten\n\n{■’C\n\n###### Abstract\n\n Phishing attacks are the most common form of infiltration used by Iranian state-backed\n\n hackers to gain access into accounts. Certfa reviews the latest campaign of phishing\n\n attacks that has been carried out and dubbed as “The Return of The Charming Kitten”.\n\n In this campaign, hackers have targeted individuals who are involved in economic and\n\n military sanctions against the Islamic Republic of Iran as well as politicians civil and\n\n\n-----\n\n###### human rights activists and journalists around the world.\n\n Our review in Certfa demonstrates that the hackers - knowing that their victims use two-\n\n step verification - target verification codes and also their email accounts such as Yahoo!\n\n and Gmail. As a result, Certfa believes the safest existing way to confront these attacks\n\n is using Security Keys such as YubiKey.\n\n Introduction\n\n In early October 2018, MDOugh, a Twitter user'', revealed phishing attacks of a group of\n\n Iranian hackers against US financial institution infrastructure. According to this user,\n\n these attacks could possibly be a reaction to new sanctions against Iran.\n\n The account mentioned a domain with the address accounts[-]support[.]services for the\n\n first time. This domain is linked to a group of hackers who are supported by the Iranian\n\n government, and that we believe have close ties with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard\n\n Corps (IRGC). ClearSky^ has previously published detailed reports on their activities.\n\n A month after these attacks, the administrators of accounts-support[.]services expanded\n\n their activities and started targeting civil and human rights activists, political figures and\n\n also Iranian and Western journalists.\n\n Methods of Attacks\n\n Cur investigation illustrates that the attackers are utilising different methods to carry out\n\n their attacks. These methods can be put into two categories:\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 1. Phishing attacks through unknown email or social media and messaging accounts\n\n 2. Phishing attacks through email or social media and messaging accounts of public\n\n figures, which have been hacked by the attackers\n\n We have also found that the hackers have collected information on their targets prior to\n\n the phishing attack. The hackers design specific plans for each target based on the level\n\n of targets’ cyber knowledge, their contacts, activities, working time, and their geographic\n\n situation.\n\n We also noticed that, unlike in previous phishing campaigns, in some cases the hackers\n\n did not change the password of their victims’ accounts in these latest attacks. This\n\n allows them to remain undetected and monitor a victim’s communications via their email\n\n in real time.\n\n Fake alerts of unauthorised access\n\n According to the samples of phishing attacks, the main trick used by these hackers to\n\n deceive their targets is that of sending fake alerts through email addresses such as\n\n notifications. maiiservices@gmaii[.]com, norepiy. customermails@gmail[.]com,\n\n customer]email-deiivery[.]info etc. stating that unauthorised individuals have tried to\n\n access their accounts.\n\n\n-----\n\nDo you recognise this activily?\n\n**!>•**\n\nl.tr,:- l-'-. Vi.l.ltlbi.l\n\n'40, I'; ACCOUNT\n###### fh\n\n[https://sites.google.com/'view/biahblahblah/blahblahblah](https://sites.google.com/'view/biahblahblah/blahblahblah)\n\n###### By using this method, attackers pretend that the email provider has sent security alerts\n\n to the targets and they should immediately review and restrict suspicious accesses.\n\n More details are available in the “Destination Link” section.\n\n Fake file sharing on Google Drive\n\n Sending links with titles such as share files from Google Drive has been one of the most\n\n common tricks that hackers have used in recent years. A unique point of these attacks\n\n in comparison with the previous ones is that they use Google Site^, which allows the\n\n hackers to show a fake download page of Google Drive, which tricks the users into\n\n thinking it’s a real Google Drive page.\n\n\n-----\n\n_&_ _G_ ' cjoocjie.com ...\n\n###### oql^\n\nDovmload link is fsady\n\nrsf\n\n###### For example, the hacker had used hxxps://sites.google[.]com/view/sharingdrivesystem\n\n to deceive the users and convince them the page is the authentic Google Drive as users\n\n can see google.com in the address bar of their browsers. Certfa has reported this link\n\n and similar links to Google and Google has now terminated them.\n\n By creating websites with the same design and look of Google Drive file sharing page,\n\n hackers pretend to be sharing a file with the user, which they should download and run it\n\n on their devices. They use hacked Twitter, Facebook and Telegram accounts to send\n\n these links and target new users. The truth is there is not any file and the hackers use\n\n this page to direct their targets to the fake Google login page, which the users enter\n\n their credential details including 2 factor authentication.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### The Attack Structure\n\n Most of these attacks are currently occurring through phishing emails. As a result, it\n\n would be useful to take a look the original content in recent phishing campaigns.\n\nstylejs'xx ity\" target\n\n                 - mg src\n\n_d_\n\nmg srcs:\"ht\n\nX\n\n###### 1. Destination fink\n\n 1.1. Trusted Stage: Internet users around the world consider Google’s main domain\n\n (google.com) to be a safe and secure address. The attackers misuse this fact and\n\n create fake pages on sites.google.com (which is a subdomain of Google) to deceive\n\n their targets. Google’s Site service gives its users an ability to show various contents on\n\n it. The attackers use this ability to send fake alerts and redirect their targets to insecure\n\n websites or embedded phishing pages as a iframe on those pages.\n\n\n-----\n\n**I** _iii_ I f / **attacker-** **domai** **n** **.com**\n\nMost users can easily detect the phishing website by looking at\n\nthe domain names and full URLs.\n\n**google.com**\n\nAttackers use Google's Site Service, which allows them to\n\ncreate web pages under site.google.com, to send safe and\n\nsecure looking links to their targets.\n\n**google.com**\n\nAfter creating websites on Google's Site service, the attackers\n\nsend links to their targets. These link can redirect their targets\n\nto malicious websites or steal their data directly.\n\n###### 1.2. Untrusted Stage: Since Google can quickly recognise and eliminate suspicious\n\n and malicious links on sites.google.com, the hackers use their own website. The links of\n\n phishing websites have similar patterns to a previous phishing campaign which was\n\n launched in the past years. For example, attackers use words such as “management”,\n\n customize”, “service”, “identification”, “session”, “confirm” etc. in the domains name and\n\n phishing URLs to deceive users who want to verify their website addresses.\n\n 2. Clickable image in emails\n\n The hackers use an image, instead of texts, in the body of their emails, to bypass\n\n Google’s security and anti-phishing system. For this purpose, attackers have also used\n\n\n-----\n\n###### third party services such as Firefox Screenshot\"^ to host their email images.\n\nSuspicious activity in your account\n\nin!\n\n                                                                                                        - \" t\n\ntjmix\n\nDo you recognize this activity?\n\n_!\\<r_ ACC\n\n###### 3. Hidden tracking image on emails\n\n The attackers use a separate hidden image in the body of the email to notify them when\n\n their targets open the email. This trick helps the hackers to act immediately after the\n\n target opens the email and clicks on the phishing link.\n\n Phishing Pages\n\n Apart from the content structure of the emails and phishing links, we are sure that\n\n attackers use a customized platform to create and store users’ credential details. We\n\n have also noticed that they have designed the phishing pages for both desktop and\n\n mobile versions of Google and Yahoo! mail services and they might use other services\n\n in the future.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### An interesting technique they have used in recent attacks was once their target enters\n\n their username and password, attackers check those credentials on-the-fly and if that\n\n information was given correctly, they then ask for 2-step verification code.\n\n In other words, they check victims’ usernames and passwords in realtime on their own\n\n servers, and even if 2 factor authentication such as text message, authenticator app or\n\n one-tap login are enabled they can trick targets and steal that information too.\n\n Figures 6 to 9 demonstrate some examples of the phishing pages, which have been\n\n sent to the targets by the Iranian hackers.\n\n**(1)** **e** **-** **☆**\n\n**e**\n\nWelcome\n\n9 viclimCygmail com v'\n\ny\n\nEnglfShfUnKed Kingdom) v\n\n**)**\n\n\n-----\n\n**<s>** **e** _ti_\n\nV..0 tMJ\n\n2-Step Verification\n\nThis extra step shows that it's realiy you trying to\n\nsign in\n\nI vlctinira)gf)iail com\n\n2-Step Verification\n\nA text message v.'ilh a 6-(iigit verification code v.'as just\nsent to “00\n\nDon't ask again on this conipulei\n\n\n-----\n\n**C^.** **e** **■\"**\n\n###### YAHOO/\n\n YAHOO/\n\nHello\nvitliin{ii)vali()o.i:oin\n\n\n-----\n\n**(i)** e .               - • t:?\n\n###### YAHOO/\n\n YAHOO/\n\nviciinioH'ahoo.coni\n\n**Enti‘1** **Account** **Key** **Code**\n\n( JkT.k \\(im jiiiiiiif (r!

Our latest findings show that for this\n\n phishing campaign in a relatively short period of time, (September to November 2018),\n\n they have used more than 20 domain names.

In spite of their efforts, we have uncovered\n\n enough evidence to prove that the attackers were using their real IP addresses (i.e\n\n 89.198.179[.]103 and 31.2.213[.] 18 from Iran during the preparation phase of their\n\n campaign).\n\n Also, some domain names and servers of this campaign are very similar to the\n\n methods, techniques and targets that been used by Charming Kitten, a group of hackers\n\n who are linked to the Iranian government. Consequently, we believe Charming Kitten\n\n and the Iranian hacker(s) belonging to this group have returned and launched new\n\n cyber attacks against various people around the world and with more focus on Israeli\n\n and American citizens.\n\n Conclusion\n\n Phishing attacks are the most popular method of stealing data and hacking account\n\n amongst Iranian hackers, but the most significant fact about this campaign is its timing.\n\n This campaign launched weeks before 4 November 2018 which is when the U.S.\n\n imposed new sanctions on Iran. This campaign tries to collect information by infiltrating\n\n the accounts of non-Iranian political figures and authorities who work on economic and\n\n military sanctions against Iran.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### In other words, hackers who are supported by the Iranian government pick their targets\n\n according to policies and international interests for the Iranian government and also\n\n where Iran wants to have impact indirectly.\n\n A a result, we propose a series of recommendations to tech companies, policymakers,\n\n civil society actors and internet users to effectively lessen the threat of this type of attack\n\n and even thwart them.\n\n Our recommendations to tech companies and policy makers:\n\n         - Stop using 2 factor authentication by text plain message/SMS.\n\n« Start using Security Keys (i.e. YubiKey) for 2 factor authentication for high ranking\n\n###### individuals who have sensitive jobs or activities.\n\n • Do not use one-tap login verification process.\n\n Our recommendations to civil society and the Iranian diaspora media:\n\n • Inform employees and colleagues about any phishing threats and encourage them\n\n to use Security Keys such as Yubikey for 2 factor authentication and activate\n\n Google’s Advanced Protection Program.\n\n • Always use company and institution email accounts instead of personal email for\n\n sensitive communications. Change Sender Policy Framework or SPF® settings\n\n according to the communication policy of the company/organisation such as\n\n restricting receiving emails from outside of the working network. For example, G\n\n Suite allows admins to block receiving emails from unauthorised address or\n\n domains^.\n\n • Encourage the public to enable 2 factor authentication on their account by mobile\n\n apps such as Google Authenticator.\n\n Our recommendations to users:\n\n • Do not click on unknown links. For reviewing suspicious activities on your account\n\n or change the password, instead of clicking on any link, you can go to your “My\n\n Account” settings from your email directly which is more safer.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### • Use email encryption such PGP for sensitive emails which prevent hackers reading\n\n your emails in the first place.\n\n • Do not store classified and sensitive information as a plain text in your mailbox.\n\n • HTTPS being before a domain names in a URL does not mean that the content of\n\n a website is secure or trusted - it’s just a secure extension of the HTTP protocol.\n\n Do not forget many phishing websites are currently operating under HTTPS\n\n protocol too.\n\n lOCs\n\n 178.162.132[.]65\n 190.2.154[.]34\n\n 190.2.154[.]35\n\n 190.2.154[.]36\n\n 190.2.154[.]38\n\n 46.166.151[.]211\n\n 51.38.87[.]64\n\n 51.38.87[.]65\n\n 51.68.185[.]96\n\n 51.38.107[.]113\n\n 95.211.189[.]45\n\n 95.211.189[.]46\n\n 95.211.189[.]47\n\n 213.227.139[.]148\n\n 54.37.241 [.]221\n\n 54.38.144[.]250\n\n 54.38.144[.]251 54.38.144[.]252 85.17.127[.]172\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 85.17.127[.]173\n\n 85.17.127[.]174\n\n 85.17.127[.]175\n\n 89.198.179[.]103\n\n 31.2.213[.]18\n\n accounts-support[.]services\n\n broadcast-news[.]info\n\n broadcastnews[.]pro\n\n com-identifier-servicelog[.]info\n\n com-identifier-servicelog[.]name\n\n com-identifier-userservicelog[.]com\n\n confirm-session-identification[.]info\n\n confirm-session-identifier[.]info\n\n confirmation-service[.]info\n\n customer-recovery[.]info\n\n customize-identity[.]info\n\n document-share[.]info\n\n document.support-recoverycustonners[.]services\n\n documentofficupdate[.]info\n\n documents.accounts-support[.]services\n\n documentsfilesharing[.]cloud\n\n email-delivery[.]info\n\n mobile-sessionid.customize-identity[.]info\n\n mobiles-sessionid.customize-identity[.]info\n\n my-scribdinc[.]online\n\n myyahoo.ddns[.]net\n\n notificationapp[.]info\n\n onlinemessenger.com-identifier-servicelog[.]name\n\n podcastmedia[.]online\n\n recoveryusercustomer[.]info\n\n session-management[.]info\n\n support-recoverycustomers[.]services\n\n\n-----\n\n###### continue-session-identifier[.]info\n\n mobilecontinue[.]network\n\n session-identifier-webservice,mobilecontinue[.]network\n\n com-messengersaccount[.]name\n\n invitation-to-messenger[.]space\n\n confirm-identification[.]name\n\n mobilecontinue[.]network\n\n mobile.confirm-identification[.]nanne\n\n services.confirm-identification[.]name\n\n mobile-messengerplus[.]network\n\n confirm.mobile-messengerplus[.]network\n\n com-messengercenters[.]name\n\n securemail.mobile-messengerplus[.]network\n\n documents.mobile-messengerplus[.]network\n\n confirm-identity[.]net\n\n identifier-sessions-mailactivityid[.]site\n\n activatecodeoption.ddns[.]net\n\n broadcastpopuer.ddns[.]net\n\n books.com-identifier-servicelog[.]name\n\n mb.sessions-identifier-memberemailid[.]network\n\n sessions-identifier-memberemailid[.]network\n\n sessions.mobile-messengerplus[.]network\n\n confirm-verification-process[.]systems\n\n accounts.confirm-verification-process[.]systems\n\n broadcastnews.ddns[.]net\n\n account-profile-users[.]info\n\n us2-mail-login-profile[.]site\n\n us2.login-users-account[.]site\n\n login-users-account[.]site\n\n live.account-profile-users[.]info\n\n signin.account-profile-users[.]info\n\n aol.account-profile-users[.]info\n\n\n-----\n\n###### • users-accountf.lsite\n\n Footnotes:\n\n1.

RAMSEY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR\n###### PROTECTIVE ORDER TEMPQIUIRILY SEALING DOCUMENTS\n\nI, Gabriel M, Ramsey, declare as follow:\n\n1. I am an attorney admitted to practice in the State of California and the District of\n\nColumbia. 1 am a partner at the law firm of Crowell & Moring LLP (“CrowelF’), counsel of record\n\nfor the Plaintiff m this matter, Microsoft Corporation (“Microsoft”). I make this declaration in\n\nsupport of Microsoft’s Motion for a Protective Order 'I'cmporarily Sealing Documents. I have\n\npersonal knowledge of the facts set forth in this declaration and, if called to testify as a witness,\n\ncould and would testify to the following under oath.\n\n**2,** This case arises out of the harmful and malicious Internet activities of DefendantS\n\nJohn Does 1 and 2 (collectively “Defendants”). I am informed and on that basis believe that\n\nDefendants are sophisticated cybercriminals who specialize in stealing sensitive information from\n\ncomputer networks. I am informed and on that basis believe that Defendants make unauthorized\n\naccess to Microsoft’s services and software, hack into a target’s computer network, and in\n\n1\n\n\n-----\n\nparticular Microsoft’s software, install malware on those networks giving them long-term and\n\nsurreptitious access to those networks, and then locate and exfiltratc sensitive information from\n\nthem.\n\n**3.** I am informed and believe that, for reasons explained in detail in the declaration of\n\nDavid Anselmi In Support Of Microsoft’s Application For Temporary Restraining Order And\n\nOrder To Show Cause For Preliminary Injunction (“TRO Application”), filed contemporaneously\n\nherewith, permitting Defendants to learn of these proceedings prior to execution of the temporary\n\nex parte relief sought in Microsoft’s Motion For Preliminary Injunction Order-—in particular the\n\nportion to disable the domains in Appendix A to that Order would preclude Microsoft’s ability to\n\nobtain effective relief against Defendants. This is because Defendants are highly sophisticated\n\ncybercriminals capable of quickly adapting the command and control infrastructure used to\n\nperpetrate Defendants unlawful conduct in order to overcome Microsoft's remediation efforts.\n\n4. 1 am informed and believe that, absent a protective order, there is a substantial risk\n\nthat Defendants will learn of these proceedings before the temporary ex parte relief to disable the\n\ndomains in Appendix A to the Preliminary Injunction Order can be effected and will take steps to\n\nevade the relief sought.\n\n**5** Over the past nine years, I, on behalf of Microsoft, have been involved with\n\nprosecuting twelve similar cases. 1 he.se cases all involved similar litigation strategies and claims\n\nand have involved John Doe defendants conducting illegal activities through identifiable but\n\nmovable online command and control infrastructures similar to that used by Phosphorus. In several\n\nof those cases, I personally observed that defendants also immediately took action to attempt to\n\ndefy and evade the court’s order as soon as they detected legal action being taken against them.\n\n6. Thus, given Defendants’ defiance of this Court’s injunctive orders and my past\n\nexperience with cases with very similar circumstance as those here, it is my belief that even\n\n**2**\n\n\n-----\n\ndisclosing that Microsoft has requested a Preliminary Injunctive Order to disable the domains at\n\nAppendix A to that order gives Defendants the opportunity to adapt the command and control\n\ninfrastructure so that they can continue to peipctrate their unlawful conduct. For this reason,\n\nMicrosoft respectfully requests that all documents filed in this case be temporarily sealed.\n\nI declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United States that the foregoing iIS\n\ntrue and correct to the best of my knowledge. Executed on this 14th day of March 2019, in\n\nWashington, D.C\n\n/\nGabnci fvff^Rarnsey\n\n3\n\n\n-----\n\n**IN** **THE** **UNITED** **STATES** **DISTRICT** **COURT**\n**FOR** **THE** **DISTRICT** **OF** **COLUMBIA**\n\n**)**\nMICROSOFT CORPORATION, a\n\n**)**\n\nWashington corporation,\n\n**)**\n\nPlaintiff, **)**\n\n**)**\nCivil Action No:\n**V.** **)**\n**)**\nJOHN DOES 1-2, CONTROLLING A\n\n**)**\n\nCOMPUTER NETWORK AND THEREBY **)** **FILED** **UNDER** **SEAL** **PURSUANT** **TO**\nINJURING PLAINTIFF AND ITS **LOCAL** **RULE** **5.1**\n\n**)**\n\nCUSTOMERS\n\n**)**\n**)**\nDefendants. **)**\n**)**\n**)**\n**)**\n\n**ORDER** **GRANTING** **MICROSOFT’S** **MOTION** **FOR** **A** **PROTECTIVE** **ORDER**\n**TEMPORARILY** **SEALING** **DOCUMENTS**\n\nBefore the Court is Microsoft’s Motion for a Protective Order Temporarily Sealing\n\nDocuments.

The\n\nmotion is granted, subject to any further consideration by the United States District Judge to\n\nwhom this case is randomly assigned.\n\n**I.** **LEGAL** **STANDARD**\n\n###### The starting point in considering a motion to seal court records is a strong presumption\n\nin favor of public access to judicial proceedings.” _Hardaway_ v. _D.C._ _Hous._ _Autk,_ 843 F.3d 973,\n\n980 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (quoting _EEOC_ v. _Nat’l_ _Children’s_ _Ctr.,_ _Inc.,_ 98 F.3d 1406, 1409 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1996)). Courts should consider six factors, originally identified in _United_ _States_ v. _Hubbard,_\n\n650 F.2d 293 (D.C. Cir. 1980), in determining whether that presumption may be overcome.\n\nincluding;\n\n(1) the need for public access to the documents at issue; (2) the extent of previous\npublic access to the documents; (3) the fact that someone has objected to disclosure.\n\n1 .\n\n\n-----\n\nand the identity ofthat person; (4) the strength of any property and privacy interests\nasserted; (5) the possibility of prejudice to those opposing disclosure; and (6) the\npurposes for which the documents were introduced during the judicial\nproceedings.”\n\n_Metlife,_ _Inc._ v. _Fin._ _Stability_ _Oversight_ _Council,_ 865 F.3d 661, 665 (D.C.

In“motionsto\n\nseal or unseal judicial records, the _Hubbard_ test has consistently served as our lodestar because it\n\nensures that we fully account for the various public and private interests at stake,” _Metlife,_ _Inc.,_\n\n865 F.3d at 666.\n\nIL DISCUSSION\n\nThe plaintiff, Microsoft, requests temporary sealing of its pleadings associated with the\n\ninstant _ex_ _parte_ Motion for a Preliminary Injunction. PL’s Mot. for Sealing Order (“PL’s Mot.”)\n\nat 1. Microsoft has filed the motion for a preliminary injunction “to prevent the activities of\n\n[defendants John Does 1 and 2] who are engaged in harmful and malicious Internet activities\n\ndirected at Microsoft, its customers, and the general public.” Pi’s Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for\n\nSealing Order (“PL’s Mem.”) at 1. Specifically, Microsoft seeks to “disable the recent registered\n\ndomains set forth in Appendix A to [its] Complaint,” _id._ and warns that “advance public\n\ndisclosure or notice of that requested relief would allow Defendants to evade such relief and\n\nfurther prosecution of this action, thereby perpetuating the irreparable harm at issue,” _id._ at 1—2.\n\nMicrosoft avers that its “rights and interests in protecting its ability to obtain ex parte temporary\n\nrelief, and the necessity of sealing its pleadings in order to effectively disable the domains .. ., is\n\nparamount over any competing public interest to _immediate_ access to the information Microsoft\n\nrequests to be sealed.” _Id._ at 4 (emphasis in original).\n\nMoreover, Microsoft suggests that if its “papers are not sealed, the relief sought would\n\nvery likely be rendered fruitless, and there is a substantial risk Defendants [elsewhere referred to\n\n. 2\n\n\n-----\n\nas ‘highly sophisticated cybercriminals’] would destroy evidence.” _Id._ Microsoft points to past\n\nexperience suggesting that when the “defendants become aware of efforts to mitigate or\n\ninvestigate their activities, they take steps to conceal their activities and to conceal the injury\n\ncaused to their victims, making it more difficult for their victims to adequately assess the damage\n\nor take steps to mitigate that injury. _Id._ at 5. This experience “underscores the risk that the\n\nDefendants in this case will take similar steps to destroy evidence and move their eommand and\n\ncontrol infrastructure ... if they are given notice of the” instant aetion. _Id._\n\nMicrosoft notes that it “only seeks to seal [its pleadings] for a limited period oftime, until\n\nafter effective ex parte temporary relief has been obtained, disabling the domains.. .. [after\n\nwhich] all documents will be unsealed and the public will be given full access to these\n\nproceedings.” _See_ _id._ at 6. If the United States District Judge to whom this case is assigned\n\ngrants Microsoft’s request to disable the defendants’ domains, Microsoft proposes to file a\n\nNotice with the Clerk of the Court when that order is executed, at which point the pleadings in\n\nthis matter may be unsealed. _Id._ at 2, 6; Pl.’s Mot. at 2.\n\nAt this early stage of the litigation, the Court is persuaded that the plaintiff has met its\n\nburden of showing that the interests in temporarily sealing this case outweigh the public interest\n\nin disclosure because sealing is necessary in order to protect evidence and to prevent the\n\ndefendants from taking steps to conceal their activities or any injuries caused to plaintiff or\n\nothers. Therefore, the Court grants the plaintiffs motion to seal this case.\n\n###### III. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, it is hereby\n\n###### ORDERED that the plaintiffs Motion for a Temporary Sealing Order is GRANTED;\n\nand it is further\n\n3\n\n\n-----\n\n###### ORDERED that this action, and all papers and pleadings filed in connection therewith,\n\n shall remain sealed until further Order of the Court; and it is further\n\n ORDERED that the plaintiff will be expected to discuss its proposal for the process of\n\n lifting the sealing order at the first scheduled Court conference on this matter.\n\n**SO** **ORDERED,**\n\n###### Date; March 14, 2019\n\n BERYL A. HOWELL Chief Judge\n\n**4**\n\n\n-----",
