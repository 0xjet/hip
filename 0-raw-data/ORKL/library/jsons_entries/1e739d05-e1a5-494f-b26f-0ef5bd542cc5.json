Albany International Airport's insurer reimbursed part of the ransom payment,\nwith a $25,000 deductible to be recovered from Logical Net.\n\n\"Thanks to the fast action by our IT department, airport operations during one of the busiest\ntravel periods of the year were not impacted and no passenger or airline data was acquired\nor accessed,\" Calderone added.\n\n\"Within hours the authority was able to resume all administrative functions with systems\nfunctioning as normal. We are grateful for the assistance provided by the New York State\nCyber Command, the FBI and our consultant ABS.\"\n\nBleepingComputer has contacted the Albany International Airport, Logical Net, and the\nSodinokibi actors asking for more details but has not yet heard back.\n\n## High-profile Sodinokibi victims\n\nInternational foreign currency exchange Travelex is another company hit by Sodinokibi on\n[New Year's Eve, with the company being forced to shut down all its systems \"to protect data](https://twitter.com/TravelexUK/status/1212840156480315401)\nand prevent the spread of the virus.\"\n\nFollowing the complete systems shut down, customers were unable to use the site or the\napp for transactions at around 1,500 Travelex locations across the world.\n\nWhile Travelex said in a statement that there is no evidence that any of its data was stolen\nin the attack, the Sodinokibi crew later told BleepingComputer that they copied over 5GB of\npersonal and financial data, including but not limited to names, dates of birth, social security\nnumbers, payment card info.\n\nThey also said that Travelex's backup files were also deleted and they will start publishing\nthe stolen data if the company doesn't pay the $3 million ransom in seven days.\n\nU.S. data center provider CyrusOne also had some of its systems encrypted by Sodinokibi\nRansomware in early December 2019, while hundreds of dental practices using the online\n[backup product DDS Safe had their files locked in August after the software's developer got](https://www.dentalrecord.com/dds-safe)\ninfected through its cloud management provider, [PercSoft.](http://www.percsoft.com/)\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[REvil ransomware returns: New malware sample confirms gang is back](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/revil-ransomware-returns-new-malware-sample-confirms-gang-is-back/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[US Senate: Govt s ransomware fight hindered by limited reporting](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-senate-govt-s-ransomware-fight-hindered-by-limited-reporting/)\n\n[US links Thanos and Jigsaw ransomware to 55-year-old doctor](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-links-thanos-and-jigsaw-ransomware-to-55-year-old-doctor/)\n\n[US offers $15 million reward for info on Conti ransomware gang](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-offers-15-million-reward-for-info-on-conti-ransomware-gang/)\n\n[The Week in Ransomware - May 6th 2022 - An evolving landscape](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-week-in-ransomware-may-6th-2022-an-evolving-landscape/)\n\n[AirPort](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/airport/)\n[New York](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/new-york/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n[REvil](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/revil/)\n[Sodinokibi](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/sodinokibi/)\n[USA](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/usa/)\n\n[Sergiu Gatlan](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/sergiu-gatlan/)\n\nSergiu Gatlan is a reporter who covered cybersecurity, technology, Apple, Google, and a\nfew other topics at Softpedia for more than a decade.
