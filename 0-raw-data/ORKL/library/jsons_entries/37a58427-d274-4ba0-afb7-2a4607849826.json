According to the World Economic\nForum Global Risks Report 2020, over the next 10\nyears, cyberattacks will be the second greatest\nrisk businesses will face.[1] While nation state cyber\nactivities tend to garner the most international\nattention, cybercriminals are responsible for the\nmajority of malicious activity on the internet –\ncybercrime is estimated at about 80%.[2] As a\nresult, reducing cyber risk means reducing and\nmitigating cybercrime.\n\nTraditionally, governments have been responsible\nfor combating crime. However, the unique realm\nof cyberspace has proved that governments do\nnot and will not have all the capabilities needed to\ncombat the cybercrime threat alone. In fact, many\nof the required capabilities reside in the private\nsector, such that private companies must be part\nof the solution. Enabling stronger operational\ncollaboration between the private and public\nsectors at the global level and combining their\nresources and capabilities are therefore crucial\nelements in reducing the risk posed by cybercrime.\nVarious significant collaborative initiatives exist, but\nthey remain fragmented and insufficient for current\nneeds. A paradigm shift in the way we collectively\naddress this challenge is thus required.\n\nThe World Economic Forum created the Partnership\nagainst Cybercrime initiative to address this global\nchallenge by exploring ways to amplify publicprivate cooperation against cybercrime and\novercome existing barriers to cooperation. The\ninitiative brought together key private and public\nstakeholders, including leading law enforcement\nagencies, international organizations, cybersecurity\ncompanies, service and platform providers, global\ncorporations and leading not-for-profit alliances.\n\nDespite the challenges of the passing year due to\nthe COVID-19 pandemic, the community showed\nnotable commitment to the task, driven by the\n\n\nmutual interests and benefits of working together\ntowards a shared goal. The members of the World\nEconomic Forum Partnership against Cybercrime\nWorking Group engaged in a series of virtual yet\nintense discussions that resulted in the three main\nrecommendations presented in this report. The\napproach chosen for this initiative was not only to\nunderstand the challenges, but to design forwardlooking and action-oriented solutions.\n\nThe first two sections of this report present the\nchallenge of cybercrime and the need to foster\npublic-private cooperation. The third and fourth\nsections lay out the principles and considerations\nformulated by the working group to support\ncollaborative action against cybercrime. The final\nsection outlines a potential global architecture to\nincrease existing efforts and facilitate the required\ncooperation.\n\nThis report highlights the commitment of an\nengaged, purpose-driven multistakeholder\ncommunity that continues to develop and\nimplement these concepts with the aim of reducing\ncybercrime globally. We hope it will encourage other\nlike-minded individuals and organizations to join us\nin advancing this critical mission.\n\n\n-----\n\n# Foreword\n\n### A public-private partnership against cybercrime is the only way to gain an edge over cybercriminals. This report provides key insights on how to achieve this together.\n\n\nJürgen Stock\nSecretary-General\nInternational Criminal Police\nOrganization (INTERPOL),\nLyon\n\n\nOf all the types of crime, cybercrime continues\nto increase at the fastest rate. According to\nINTERPOL’s recent assessment of the global\ncyberthreat landscape,[3] cybercriminals are\ndeveloping and boosting their attacks at an\nalarming pace, exploiting the fear and uncertainty\ncaused by the unstable social, economic and\nhealth situation around the world.\n\nWhile crimes such as burglary and assault are\nmore visible, cybercrime is largely hidden, leading\nmany people to underestimate its actual damage\nor the likelihood of becoming a victim. But the\neffects of cybercrime can be just as devastating as\nphysical crimes, impacting numerous individuals\nand organizations everywhere.\n\nTo address this threat, we must create barriers\nto entry, such as raising the cost of engaging\nin criminal activities and the overall risk for\ncybercriminals. Law enforcement agencies\nworldwide are actively investigating cybercrimes\nwith the aim of prosecuting cybercriminals.\n\n\nINTERPOL, through its Global Cybercrime\nProgramme, is facilitating law enforcement\ncooperation and promoting police capacities in the\nfield of cyber. But this is not enough.\n\nAgainst cybercrime, the solution can only come\nfrom public-private cooperation. The private\nsector plays a fundamental role in the ability to\nunderstand and act against cybercriminals. Only\nby ensuring that leading companies work side\nby side with law enforcement can we effectively\nrespond to the cybercrime threat.\n\nThe World Economic Forum is well positioned\nto promote this cooperation. With INTERPOL\nand other primary stakeholders from the\nprivate and public sectors, it has devised the\nrecommendations presented in this report.\nImplementing them and continuing to work\ntogether through the Partnership against\nCybercrime will drive momentum to amplify\ncollaboration in our joint fight against cybercrime.\n\n\n-----\n\n# Executive summary\n\n### The public and private sectors must work together to fight cybercrime. To do so, each needs to embrace effective ways of working together and foster needed alliances.\n\n\nCybercrime impacts everyone, from individuals\nto global corporations and critical infrastructures\nor governments. It causes immense, though not\nalways visible, damage to economies and societies.\nIt drastically undermines the benefits of the Fourth\nIndustrial Revolution, increases inequality and\nhinders international cyber stability efforts.\n\nAs in the case of any other crime, systematic\ncontainment efforts against cybercrime must\nalso include actions against the sources of the\nthreat. This can only be achieved through stronger\noperational collaboration between the private and\npublic sectors, leveraging private companies’\nunique position and capabilities in this field. While\nvarious significant collaborative initiatives exist, they\nremain fragmented and insufficient for current needs\nand an ever-evolving cybercrime threat landscape.\n\n[Following the 2016 work on Recommendations](http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Cybercrime_Principles.pdf)\n[for Public-Private Partnership against Cybercrime,](http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Cybercrime_Principles.pdf)\n[the World Economic Forum’s Partnership against](https://www.weforum.org/projects/partnership-against-cybercime)\n[Cybercrime initiative was launched in January](https://www.weforum.org/projects/partnership-against-cybercime)\n2020 to explore ways to amplify public-private\ncollaboration in cybercrime investigations and initiate\na paradigm shift in the way to collectively deal with\nthe growing impact of cybercrime. The initiative’s\nworking group included more than 50 representatives\nfrom leading public and private organizations.\n\nThis report presents the recommendations of the\nPartnership against Cybercrime Working Group in\nthree areas:\n\nPromoting principles for public-private\ncooperation to combat cybercrime\nThe working group defined six principles, to be\nendorsed by both law enforcement and private\ncompanies, which can enable sustainable,\nrepeatable and effective cooperation:\n\n– Embracing a shared narrative for collective\naction against cybercrime\n\n– Cooperating on the basis of long-term strategic\nalignment\n\n– Undertaking trust-building behaviours\n\n\n– Systematizing cooperation\n\n– Ensuring value for participation in the\ncooperation\n\n– Respecting concerns and challenges\n\nTaking collaborative action to disrupt\ncybercrime ecosystems\nThe working group also emphasized the need to\nexplore the full spectrum of possible courses of\naction to raise the costs and risk for cybercriminals,\nleveraging the respective expertise and capabilities\nof both the public and private sectors. Specifically,\npotential coordinated measures to disrupt and\ndismantle criminal activities at scale are insufficiently\nused. A decision to participate in such operations\nshould not be made lightly, but organizations should\nnot be paralysed by inaction. The Group highlighted\nkey considerations for decision-makers in assessing\nthese actions, to maximize the likelihood of success\nand minimize unnecessary risks.\n\nPartnering to combat global cybercrime\nTo increase existing efforts and fully harness the\npower of the private sector, facilitating sustainable\nand effective cooperation, the working group\nrecommends launching a three-level system\ncomprised of:\n\n– A global partnership, building on the existing\nForum initiative, to bring together international\nstakeholders to provide an overarching narrative\nand commitment to cooperate; foster interaction\nwithin a global network of entities that drive\nefforts to fight cybercrime; and facilitate\nstrategic dialogues and processes aiming to\nsupport cooperation and overcome barriers in\nthe long term.\n\n– Permanent Nodes, a global network of existing\norganizations that strive to facilitate publicprivate cooperation over time.\n\n– Threat Focus Cells, short-term, mission-driven\ngroups of partners that engage in concrete,\noperational, cooperative efforts. These cells will be\nhosted and maintained by the Permanent Nodes.\n\n\n-----\n\n### 1\n\n\n# The global challenge of cybercrime\n\n\n#### 1.1 The impact of cybercrime\n\nAn estimated 4.66 billion people around the world\ncurrently use the internet,[4] a number that has tripled\nin the past 12 years as connectivity has become\nmore accessible, and that will continue to increase.\nOur reliance on the use of computers and technology\nhas changed the way we conduct business,\ncommunicate and socialize, and technology is an\nindispensable part of all facets of life.\n\nHumans are increasingly dependent on the internet,\nyet our efforts to protect people, data, devices\nand the infrastructure of the internet itself from\ncybercriminals have not matched the threat they\npose. Cyber criminals steal an estimated $600\nbillion per year from governments, companies\nand individuals,[5] while the overall loss of company\nrevenues over the course of five years, from 2019\nto 2023, will reach $5.2 trillion.[6] In fact, cybercrime\nis one of the most disruptive and economically\ndamaging criminal activities. Not only does it cause\nsubstantial financial damages and pose a serious\nthreat to society and the global economy, it also\nhas indirect effects in undermining the public’s\nconfidence in digital transformation and overall trust\nin technology.\n\nOur connected world has become a lucrative\nplayground for cybercriminals who can launch\nattacks on victims in multiple countries and\njurisdictions with little fear of being caught. They\nuse malicious software programs and technical\ninfrastructure to steal funds, intellectual property\nand sensitive personal information. They carry out\nattacks on individual users, networks and corporate\nsystems to engage in an enormous amount of\nfraudulent and destructive activity. The tools and\n\n\nservices available to criminals as part of the crimeas-a-service model, which lowers the entry barrier\nto committing cybercrime and provides relatively\nsophisticated cyber capabilities to almost anyone\nwho is willing to pay, are also significantly increasing\nthe growing impact of cybercrimes.\n\nThe cybercrime threat landscape is quite diverse\nand dynamic. Threat actors range from individuals,\nto loosely connected cross-national collectives,\nto large organizations that in many cases enjoy a\ndegree of support, tolerance or even direction from\nnation states. Cybercriminals abuse encryption,\ncryptocurrencies, anonymity services and other\ntechnologies. Financially motivated cybercriminals\nconstantly innovate to increase their profits. In\naddition to financial crimes, criminals use internetbased infrastructure to uphold terrorism and drug\ntrafficking, and spread disinformation to destabilize\ngovernments and democracies.[7]\n\nAt the macro level, cybercrime is an enormous\nbarrier to digital trust, greatly undermining\nthe benefits of cyberspace and hindering\ninternational cyber stability efforts. In addition,\ncybercrimes increase global inequality, putting\nboth the corporations and governments with fewer\nresources at higher risk of falling prey to these\nactivities. Developing countries with weak legal\nand enforcement regimes as well as inadequate\ncapacity to mitigate cyberthreats are particularly\nexposed to these crimes. If not mitigated,\ncybercrimes could undermine these countries’\nefforts to formalize their economies using digital\ntechnologies, negatively impacting the anticipated\ndigital dividends.\n\n\n-----\n\ncybercriminals entice victims to provide their\npersonal data and download malicious content.\nAround two-thirds of member countries that\nresponded to the global cybercrime survey\nreported the significant use of COVID-19 themes\nfor phishing and online fraud since the outbreak.\n\n– Disruptive malware: A spike in ransomware\nattacks by multiple threat groups that had been\nrelatively dormant for the past few months\ntook place in the first two weeks of April\n2020. Investigations show that the majority of\nattackers accurately estimated the maximum\namount of ransom they could demand from\ntargeted organizations.\n\n– Malicious domains: With the increased\ndemand for medical supplies and information\non COVID-19, cybercriminals have significantly\nmultiplied registrations of domain names\ncontaining such keywords as “coronavirus” or\n“COVID”. In June 2020, 200,000 suspected\nmalicious domains existed, affecting more than\n80 countries around the world.\n\nEuropol’s series of reports have revealed similar\ntrends in European Union member states, including\nmore targeted attacks on the healthcare sector.\nThe agency’s reports also document the criminals’\nability to adapt to the crisis, as demonstrated by\nthe surge of counterfeit and fake products on\ndarknet marketplaces, including COVID-19 test\nkits, masks and pharmaceuticals. In parallel, they\nalso point to an increase in the amount of child\nabuse materials available on the darknet as well as\nin the access of illegal websites.\n\n\nSources: INTERPOL,\n“INTERPOL report shows\nalarming rate of cyberattacks\nduring COVID-19”, 4 August\n[2020, https://www.interpol.](https://www.interpol.int/News-and-Events/News/2020/INTERPOL-report-shows-alarming-rate-of-cyberattacks-during-COVID-19)\n[int/News-and-Events/](https://www.interpol.int/News-and-Events/News/2020/INTERPOL-report-shows-alarming-rate-of-cyberattacks-during-COVID-19)\n[News/2020/INTERPOL-](https://www.interpol.int/News-and-Events/News/2020/INTERPOL-report-shows-alarming-rate-of-cyberattacks-during-COVID-19)\n[report-shows-alarming-rate-](https://www.interpol.int/News-and-Events/News/2020/INTERPOL-report-shows-alarming-rate-of-cyberattacks-during-COVID-19)\n[of-cyberattacks-during-](https://www.interpol.int/News-and-Events/News/2020/INTERPOL-report-shows-alarming-rate-of-cyberattacks-during-COVID-19)\n[COVID-19; Europol, “Staying](https://www.interpol.int/News-and-Events/News/2020/INTERPOL-report-shows-alarming-rate-of-cyberattacks-during-COVID-19)\nsafe during COVID-19: What\nyou need to know”, 6 May\n[2020, https://www.europol.](https://www.europol.europa.eu/activities-services/staying-safe-during-covid-19-what-you-need-to-know)\n[europa.eu/activities-services/](https://www.europol.europa.eu/activities-services/staying-safe-during-covid-19-what-you-need-to-know)\n[staying-safe-during-covid-](https://www.europol.europa.eu/activities-services/staying-safe-during-covid-19-what-you-need-to-know)\n[19-what-you-need-to-know](https://www.europol.europa.eu/activities-services/staying-safe-during-covid-19-what-you-need-to-know)\n(both accessed 28 October\n2020).\n\n\nCybercriminals are developing and boosting\ntheir attacks at an alarming pace, exploiting the\nfear and uncertainty caused by the unstable\nsocial and economic situation caused by\nCOVID-19 around the world. At the same time,\nthe higher dependency on connectivity and\ndigital infrastructure due to the need for physical\ndistancing further expands the avenues of cyber\nintrusion and attack.\n\nTo maximize their financial gain and intended\ndamage, cybercriminals are shifting gears to\ntarget businesses, governments and critical\ninfrastructure that play a crucial role in responding\nto the outbreak. Concurrently, due to the sudden\nglobal shift to teleworking, organizations have\nhad to rapidly deploy remote systems, networks\nand applications. As a result, criminals are taking\nadvantage of the increased security vulnerabilities\narising from remote working to steal data, make\nprofits or cause disruption.\n\nThis occasion has also offered an irresistible\nopportunity for threat actors to perpetuate\ncybercrime on a global scale. Social engineering\ncampaigns using corporate logos have preyed on\nthe fear, uncertainty and doubt of unsuspecting\nusers.\n\nINTERPOL’s COVID-19 Cybercrime Analysis\nReport reveals several trends emerging as a result\nof the crisis, including:\n\n– Online scams and phishing: Threat actors\nhave revised their usual online scams and\nphishing schemes. By deploying COVID-19\nthemed phishing emails, often impersonating\ngovernment and health authorities,\n\n\n#### 1.2 The first steps to success\n\nThe primary solution to lowering the risk of\ncybercrime is to increase the cyber resilience of\npotential victims, meaning all internet-connected\norganizations and users. While resilience has been\nthe main focus of the cybersecurity market, law\nenforcement agencies are also supporting these\nefforts, by raising awareness[8] and providing alerts,[9]\nadvice and best practices.[10]\n\nThere are reasons to be optimistic on this frontier.\nRecent research shows an improvement in private\ncompanies’ approaches to prioritizing cyber hygiene\nand increasing investments in cyber resilience.[11]\nThis is also reflected in the growth of cyber\ninsurance markets.[12] The cybersecurity market also\ncontinues to grow, boosted by huge investments\nin innovation, including harnessing such advanced\n\n\ntechnologies as machine learning, robotic process\nautomation and cutting-edge encryption and\nmathematical methods.\n\nWhile cybersecurity efforts are mostly driven by\nmarket forces, more and more private companies\nare cooperating with other companies and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), significantly\nincreasing the overall capacity to address\ncyberthreats. This includes initiatives usually aimed\nat reducing the impact of the cybercrimes on their\nvictims. Leading examples are the Cybercrime\nSupport Network,[13] which helps individuals and\nbusinesses affected by cybercrimes deal with the\nchallenges, and Scamadviser,[14] which serves as\na global warning list of online scams with 2 million\nsites added every month by more than 50 partners.\n\n\n-----\n\nDue to the ever-increasing number of internet users\nworldwide, the risk and impact of cybercrime on\nindividuals and small and medium-sized enterprises\n(SMEs) globally are massive. Identity theft,\nromance scams, ransomware and business email\ncompromise are costing consumers and SMEs\nbillions with few resources available for prevention,\nresponse and recovery. Cybercrime victims need\na clear path to get support, just as victims of\nphysical crimes currently have. Unfortunately, few\ncountries have such services, notably the United\n\n\nKingdom, Australia, Canada and Israel, where\ncitizens and businesses can call one central phone\nnumber or online service to report an incident and\nreceive advice on how to respond and recover.\nGovernments and law enforcement agencies\nneed to define mandates for and ownership of the\nresponse. By increasing reporting and recovery\nresources, countries can decrease crime and\nrevictimization. The process needs to be clear for\nvictims, in line with a comprehensive response plan\ncreated by governments to support them.\n\n\nSeveral initiatives aim to make it harder for\ncybercriminals to operate and some reduce their\npotential rewards. The Europol-led No More\nRansom![15] project is a good example of a publicprivate initiative aimed at frustrating the cybercriminal\nbusiness model and ultimately reducing criminal\n\n###### B O X 3 The global threat of ransomware\n\nRansomware is a fast-evolving threat. Five\nyears ago, most ransomware attacks, with\nsome notable exceptions, were random with a\nsmall ransom designed to entice payment. This\nstrategy evolved into a business model in which\ncustomer service agents assist people with\nthe purchase of ransomware services and the\ndeposit of cryptocurrency profits, and ensure that\ndecryption keys work, to protect their reputation.\nMore recently, ransomware is targeted at specific\norganizations with large, customized demands\nbased on perceived affordability. The malware\nitself is now more sophisticated, designed to act\n\nNevertheless, as security and users are not perfect,\ncybercrime cannot be completely prevented.\nCybercriminals have proven highly adept at\nexploiting the digital ecosystem; the risk of getting\ncaught remains very low due to the anonymity\noffered by the internet and the jurisdictional\nchallenges of nationalized legal systems, whereas\nthe potential returns are very high. Moreover,\nthe profits from these malicious activities allow\ncontinuous improvements in the criminals’\n\n\nfinancial gain. Other efforts, such as the Global\nCyber Alliance[16] created by the New York County\nDistrict Attorney and the City of London Police\nCommissioner, focus on disrupting cybercriminals\nand the vulnerabilities they seek to exploit.\n\nand spread quickly and even exfiltrate people’s\ndata as added leverage for extortion. The “honour”\namong thieves that kept targets like hospitals and\ncritical infrastructure off the target list seems to\nhave crumbled. The best defence for ransomware\nis preparation: presume you will get hit, back up\nyour information resources, ensure continuity of\noperations in disruptions to the computer systems,\nand drill your response. Form your team in advance\nand include legal, technical and law enforcement\nmembers to connect you with initiatives, such as\n[Europol’s “No More Ransom!”, that have a cache](https://www.nomoreransom.org/)\nof free decryption tools and keys.\n\ncapabilities that often surpass the cybersecurity\ninvestments made by their targets.\n\nIn the long run, in order to reduce the global\nimpact of cybercrime and to systematically\nrestrain cybercriminals, cybercrime must\nbe confronted at its source by raising the\ncost of conducting cybercrimes, cutting the\nactivities’ profitability and deterring criminals by\nincreasing the direct risk they face.\n\n\n-----\n\nLaw enforcement agencies worldwide are already\nengaging in commendable efforts to address this\nthreat. Countless examples of successful action\nexist, although the general public is not usually\naware of them.[17]\n\nYet law enforcement agencies still face numerous\nchallenges as they adjust to fast-evolving digital\ncrimes. One key difficulty is limited visibility and the\nlack of information. Cybercrimes are likely to not be\nreported at all.[18,19] This situation is made worse by the\nanonymity and transnational nature of cybercrimes,\ncombined with a lack of common terminology and\nclassification of what constitutes cybercrime.\n\nCybercrimes are not considered violent crimes;[20]\nthey have a significant but almost non-measurable\nnational impact (mostly due to under-reporting). This\noften leads to under-prioritizing law enforcement\nefforts against cybercrime, the absence of clear\nnational cybercrime strategies and a shortage\nof resources invested for law enforcement. The\nlack of resources is particularly problematic when\naddressing cybercrime, which requires specific\ntools as well as personnel with technical skills and\nexpertise who tend to be expensive and in high\ndemand on the labour market.[21]\n\nMoreover, the borderless nature of cybercrime\nsignificantly challenges the structured premise of\ncriminal enforcement based on specific geography.\nIn the physical world, a crime occurs in a location\nwith the criminals physically present while, in\n\n\ncyberspace, criminals can live in one country, carry\nout crimes in another, leave evidence in a third while\nthe victim is living in a fourth. Tracking, arresting\nand prosecuting cybercriminals require international\ninformation sharing and cross-border operational\ncooperation, which are not always aligned with\nexisting legislative and operational frameworks.\nThese processes also require speed. Criminals\noperate around the clock and constantly improve\ntheir capabilities, while the sharing of information\nacross borders through mutual legal assistance\ntreaties tends to be painfully slow.\n\nIn response to these challenges, the international\ncommunity has also started taking action to\nenhance national law enforcement capabilities and\nfacilitate international cooperation on cybercrime;\nINTERPOL’s Global Cybercrime Programme and\nInnovation Centre in Singapore, Europol’s European\nCybercrime Centre and the Joint Cybercrime Action\nTaskforce hosted by the latter Centre are leading\nresults of these efforts, as are existing international\npolicy dialogues, such as the United Nations\nopen-ended intergovernmental expert group on\ncybercrime and the Council of Europe’s Cybercrime\nConvention Committee representing the State\nParties to the Budapest Convention.\n\nHowever, to date, conventional governmental\ncriminal justice efforts are proving too limited to\nmeet the challenge. Research in the United States,\nfor example, showed the likelihood that less than\n1% of cybercrime will result in arrest.[22]\n\n\n###### B O X 4 International and multilateral processes on cybercrime\n\n\n-----\n\nbeen a consensus priority area of the international\ncommunity, with prominent examples of global\ninitiatives led by the UN Office on Drugs and\n[Crime’s Global Programme on Cybercrime, the](https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/cybercrime/global-programme-cybercrime.html)\n\n\n[Council of Europe Cybercrime Programme Office,](https://www.coe.int/en/web/cybercrime/cybercrime-office-c-proc-)\nand INTERPOL’s Global Cybercrime Programme\nand Global Complex for Innovation, further to\nimportant bilateral and regional efforts.\n\n\n#### 1.4 The way forward\n\nThis threat is global – which implies that the solution\nmust also be a globally coordinated effort. There\nis no single solution to reducing the harm caused\nby cybercrime, but it is apparent that current\nefforts fall short. As long as the barriers to entry for\ncybercrime remain low and the prosecution risk for\nconducting cybercrimes is limited, cybercriminals\nwill continue to threaten societies and diminish trust\nin the digital economy.\n\n\nIt is inherently clear that a team is stronger than an\nindividual. Individually, businesses and government\norganizations continue to thwart cybercrime the\nbest way they can with some notable success.\nCyber resilience and cybersecurity are a shared\nresponsibility that involves everyone and, as\nsuch, requires an ongoing, holistic, systematic\nand coordinated approach. To improve the\nglobal security posture and to increase cyber\nresilience, however, the public and private\nsectors must work together.\n\n\n-----\n\n### 2\n\n\n# Public private cooperation against cybercrime\n\n\n#### 2.1 The unique role of private companies\n\nIn criminal investigations, law enforcement agencies First, preventing and investigating cyber incidents\ntogether with the judiciary traditionally comprise the requires significant technical skills and capabilities.\ncriminal justice process, with third parties outside Law enforcement agencies have different levels of\nthis structure only responding to legal demands capabilities in some areas than the private sector, or\nor requests for information.

Companies’ efforts to deal with concrete\nattacks most often entail actions to accelerate\n\n###### B O X 7 A framework for global cybersecurity efforts\n\nAddressing the three fundamental and unchanged\nelements of any cyberthreat – cyberattackers,\ncyberattack and cyber weakness – the framework\nrefers to three overarching, global cybersecurity\nstrategic goals:\n\n1. Reducing the cyberattack surface: Efforts\naim to raise the overall difficulty of conducting\ncyberattacks by reducing points of weakness\nacross systems and networks that could be\nexploited by malicious actors. In the context of\ncybercrime, this is mostly about increasing the\nsecurity and resilience of potential victims.\n\nLaw enforcement’s mission, somewhat separated\nfrom that, is to investigate the criminal act with the\naim of identifying, apprehending and prosecuting\nthe perpetrators. In some instances, however,\nprosecution may not be possible, but that does not\n\n\nidentifying and apprehending the perpetrators, which\nleads to a more substantial and lasting impact.\nHarnessing the private sector to work side by side\nwith law enforcement officials is therefore critical to\nsuccessfully combatting cybercriminals.\n\nrecovery and ensure business continuity, as well\nas eventually to prevent future malicious activities.\nUsing the World Economic Forum framework for\nglobal cybersecurity efforts,[23] this process could be\nillustrated as a continuous cycle, largely driven by\nmarket forces (Figure 1).\n\n2. Containing cyberattacks: Efforts aim to\ndisrupt the spread of cyberattacks and reduce\ntheir impact, usually through incident response\nand mitigation. In the context of cybercrime,\nthe cyberattacks are the materialization of the\ncrime.\n\n3. Restraining cyberattackers: Efforts directly\naddress the sources of the threat – individuals,\norganizations and states or, in general terms,\nthe offenders.\n\nmean that law enforcement has no role. It must still\nbe engaged to investigate, identify and assist victims,\nand determine if the seizure of a cybercriminal’s\nmoney or infrastructure is possible.\n\n\n-----\n\ngovernment agencies.\n\n###### F I G U R E 1 The gap in global cyber efforts\n\nEnforcement\n\nR E S T R A I N\nCyberattackers\n(The offenders)\n\nC O N TA I N R E D U C E\nGlobal Investigation Prevention Global attack\ncyberattacks surface\n(The crime) (The victims)\n\nResponse Detection\n\nSource: World Economic\nForum\n\nIt is necessary to bridge these two processes in a way that will leverage private-sector-led efforts\nand capabilities with enforcement efforts, in particular in leveraging private-sector investigations for\nenforcement activities and enhancing security efforts based on law enforcement insights.\n\n#### 2.3 Mutual benefit\n\n\nWhile the benefits of public-private cooperation for\nlaw enforcement organizations are obvious, private\norganizations may hesitate to engage without\nunderstanding the positive outcomes of the process.\nFirst and foremost, sophisticated customers expect\nprivate companies, particularly technology and\nfinancial companies, to be part of the fight against\ncrime. By participating in collaborative activities,\ncompanies can position themselves as leaders in the\nfield and active forces for good.\n\n\nAs part of the collaborative process, private-sector\ncompanies will gain access to information from\nboth law enforcement and other companies, thus\nincreasing their understanding of the threat. This\nadditional knowledge can allow the development\nof additional technical controls both internally or\nthrough products, allowing the company to protect\nits customers and understand the threats important\nto them.\n\n\n-----\n\nexperts can also lead to new findings that drive\nproduct innovation, open new avenues for threat\nresearch and build communication avenues that can\nbe used in the future to address issues outside of the\n\n\nof collective investigation and research can potentially\nimprove customer sentiment, drive innovation and\nbuild partnerships for future work.\n\n\n#### 2.4 The roadblocks: Challenges for public-private cooperation\n\n\nThe value of public-private partnerships is\nindisputable, yet connecting disparate organizations\nwith different missions and goals can be\ndifficult. Beyond the operational and cultural\nchallenges associated with cooperation, certain\npolicy considerations are major roadblocks to\ncooperation, on both sides:\n\n– For companies\n\nConflict of information sharing with data\nprotection and privacy laws: Two-way\ninformation sharing is a key component of\nany public-private cooperation. While sharing\nnon-personal data is sufficient in many cases,\noperations against malicious actors require\nadditional details, such as IP addresses, that\nstakeholders may be restricted from sharing\ndue to privacy laws and regulations (such as the\nEuropean General Data Protection Regulation\nand the US Electronic Communications\nPrivacy Act). The challenge may increase at the\ninternational level depending on the countries\nwhere the companies are based and their\nobligation to comply with national privacyrelated legislation that may limit their ability to\ncooperate internationally.\n\nAn unclear and diverse regulatory\nenvironment: In many cases, regulatory\nguidelines and rules are ambiguous and do not\nprovide a supportive environment for cooperation.\nCompanies need to take the initiative and\naccept certain risks associated with deciding\nwhich information, if any, and access to give to\nlaw enforcement personnel. While attempting\nto work against a shared threat, companies\nmay unintentionally violate regulations, for\nexample antitrust laws, or create liability risks for\nthemselves. This situation hinders companies’\nwillingness to cooperate.\n\nAgency problems and commercial\nsensitivities: Voluntary cooperation with law\nenforcement agencies may put companies\nat reputational and commercial risk, if they\nare perceived as acting at the behest of\ngovernments or jeopardizing privacy. In some\n\n\ncases, commercial interests and joint operation\nneeds may conflict.\n\n– For law enforcement agencies\n\nRestrictions on working with private\ncompanies: By law, most governments cannot\ntreat companies with similar competencies\nand services differently, as dissimilar treatment\ncould be perceived as offering a competitive\nadvantage, for example by providing access to\nprivileged information. Therefore, if collaboration\nwith the private sector is not specifically\nmentioned in their statutes, law enforcement\nagencies could argue that they cannot pursue\nefforts to cooperate.\n\nEvidence admissibility and availability:\nCompanies are willing to assist law enforcement\nagencies by sharing intelligence relevant to\nan investigation, but this information is not\nalways immediately admissible as evidence.\nThe challenge arises when the law enforcement\nagency requests to receive information\naccording to evidentiary standards (i.e. when\nrequesting evidence from the company), which\nin some cases causes companies’ unwillingness\nto share information. Moreover, regarding crossjurisdiction requests for electronic evidence\nfrom private service providers based in another\ncountry, the current international mechanism of\nmutual legal assistance is time-consuming and\nslower than the swift action needed to avoid the\nloss or change of electronic evidence.\n\nSensitive information handling: Law\nenforcement information relevant to a\ncybercrime investigation is often highly\nclassified and cannot be shared in a normal\nmanner (using email, etc.), posing challenges\nto law enforcement agencies’ ability to\nshare information with companies. Sharing\nthis information is necessary for meaningful\ncollaboration on investigations but adequate\nsecurity measures/controls and appropriate\ninformation-handling models must be in place to\nallow the sharing of information in a timely and\neffective manner.\n\n\n-----\n\nDespite these challenges, many examples\nof successful cooperation between private\ncompanies and law enforcement agencies\nexist, including collaboration initiated by a law\nenforcement agency, a company or a group of\ncompanies. INTERPOL and Europol are both\n\n###### B O X 8 Existing mechanisms for cooperation\n\n– Cyber Defence Alliance (CDA): A partnership\nbetween like-minded financial institutions to\njointly tackle the common threat of cybercrime\nby pooling resources, undertaking shared\nprojects and sharing intelligence in a trusted\nenvironment, to improve the cyber resilience of\nall members\n\n– Cyber Threat Alliance (CTA): A non-profit\norganization that facilities both automated\nand person-to-person cyberthreat intelligence\nsharing among private-sector cybersecurity\nproviders, and that builds partnerships with\ngovernment agencies to combat cyberthreats\n\n– Europol: A law enforcement agency that\nestablished the European Cybercrime\nCentre (EC3) in 2013 to strengthen the\nlaw enforcement response to cybercrime\nin the EU and thus help protect European\ncitizens, businesses and governments\nfrom cybercrimes.

Also crucial is to\nbuild structures that allow the creation of truly\ninternational efforts to address the global challenge.\n\n\n-----\n\n### 3\n\n\n# Promoting principles for public-private cooperation to combat cybercrime\n\n\n#### 3.1 The rationale\n\nSince the publication of the World Economic\n[Forum’s Recommendations for Public-Private](http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Cybercrime_Principles.pdf)\n[Partnership against Cybercrime in 2016, which](http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Cybercrime_Principles.pdf)\noutlines ways to encourage dialogues and\ncooperation to fight cybercrime, the Partnership\nagainst Cybercrime initiative has identified six\n\n\nprinciples for public-private cooperation against\ncybercrime. These principles provide a framework\nfor action-driven cooperation that can ensure\nsuccess and sustainability in collaborative activities\nwhile overcoming key challenges.\n\n\n###### Principle 1\n\n Principle 2\n\n Principle 3\n\n Principle 4\n\n\n###### Embracing a shared narrative for collective action against cybercrime\n\nThe cooperation should be based on a multistakeholder approach, in which different stakeholders, while\nrecognizing their different motivations, have joint ownership of a shared narrative and objective for the\ngreater good of reducing cybercrime across all industries and globally.\n\n###### Cooperating on the basis of long-term strategic alignment\n\nStakeholders need to commit to a long-term dialogue and to finding common ground for cooperation,\nbased on an improved understanding of their respective needs, goals and values. The collaboration should\ninclude identifying strategic barriers to the cooperation and ways to overcome them; understanding and\ndeconflicting respective priorities; recognizing new opportunities for cooperation and partnerships; and\ndeveloping new approaches and common knowledge in support of collaborative efforts.\n\n###### Undertaking trust-building behaviours\n\nSuccessful cooperation requires a certain level of trust that allows participants to feel comfortable in the\ncooperation. This trust can be achieved by building and maintaining an atmosphere of transparency,\nequity and fairness in all interactions. Joint decision-making and voluntary sharing are important elements\nin building this conducive atmosphere. Interacting regularly and discussing trust-hindering actions are also\nneeded to build trust over time.\n\n###### Systematizing the cooperation\n\nCooperation should be built on institutional relationships rather than on personal relations, leveraging the\nrespective advantages each sector brings and emphasizing common interests. This is needed both to develop\nsustainable cooperation that is not at risk when people change directions, and to improve cooperation when\ntrust and personal rapport are limited. When collaborating on concrete actions, it is important to facilitate\nimprovements by analysing successes and failures based on clearly defined objectives and expectations.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Principle 6\n\n\nCapturing both the cooperation’s concrete value as well as any other opportunities it creates is essential to\nensure continued commitment and increasing investments by all stakeholders. The mutual recognition of\nefforts is the easiest way to achieve this when successes can be communicated publicly. Moreover, twoway feedback during and following the collaboration can also optimize value creation for both sides, while\nthe cooperation should be supported and endorsed by their leadership to ensure that the value creation is\naligned with the public and the private sectors’ strategic interests.\n\n###### Respecting concerns and challenges\n\nAll the stakeholders should acknowledge and address each other’s privacy, legal and other governance\nand geopolitical limitations and concerns from the outset in order to pre-empt any roadblocks to the\ncooperation.\n\n\n###### B O X 9 A multilevel framework\n\n\n-----\n\n### 4\n\n\n# Taking collaborative action to disrupt cybercrime ecosystems\n\n\n#### 4.1 Taking action against cybercrime\n\n\nTraditional efforts to deter criminals have focused\non raising the risks to the individual criminal\nactor through attribution and prosecution by law\nenforcement agencies and the judiciary. This\napproach is of course the ultimate way to stop crime.\nIn the case of cybercrime, however, it is extremely\ndifficult to achieve this goal by these means alone,\nand the chances of inefficiency and failure are high.\nEven the exceptional efforts of international law\nenforcement agencies in recent years to investigate\ncybercrimes and prosecute cybercriminals, and their\nmany successes, have proven insufficient to lower\nthe rate of cybercrime. Most often, the operations\ninvolved in investigations and prosecutions against\ncybercrime do not combine public-sector efforts and\nprivate-sector capabilities. The investigations have\nalso shown that cybercrime does not resemble crime\nperpetrated in the physical world and thus cannot\nbe combated using traditional methods. Instead, a\nparadigm shift in the way the law enforcement and\nprivate-sector communities collaborate to address\nthis crime is required.\n\nAs mentioned, a promising way to deter\ncybercriminals is to raise the cost of engaging in\ncriminal activities. One indirect way to raise these\ncosts is to improve potential victims’ cybersecurity.\nBut, although this tactic is crucial, its results are\nlimited because criminals often find the weakest\nlinks in the cybersecurity chain.\n\nA more direct approach, with the potential for\nlarge-scale impact, is to disrupt cybercriminal\necosystems that contain infrastructures and assets.\nThis approach can include taking steps to restrict\nrevenue streams and prohibit the promotion of\nillegal sites and the hosting of criminal content.\nThese restrictions can be applied, for example,\nby seizing the merchant account used to accept\npayment for the fraudulent activity or the domain\nthat the illegal content is hosted on.\n\nDisruption focuses on massively disabling malicious\ntechnical infrastructure. Criminals who engage in\ncybercrime, such as business email compromise,\n\n\nintellectual property theft or tech support fraud,\nneed to lose their investments as quickly as they\nmake them. Quickly eliminating criminal investments\ncan inhibit their ability to execute the crime, which\nis especially needed when criminal activities pose\nan immediate danger to victims and society. In\nsome cases, it may also allow returning some of the\nlosses to the victims.\n\nPrivate-sector companies and their stakeholders\nare frequently the victims of cybercriminal conduct,\nbut they are also in a good position to lead\ndisruption efforts. Not only do private companies\nhave superior access to technical information\nand the capacity to identify, track and analyse\ncybercriminal activities, in many cases they have\nmore direct or indirect opportunity to dismantle the\ncyber infrastructures and assets criminals use.\n\nTo date, cybercrime enforcement has been a\npatchwork of government and private-sector efforts\nto stay one step ahead of sophisticated criminals.\nWhile law enforcement agencies are used to\nfocusing mostly on the more traditional attribution,\nasset seizure, arrest and prosecution approach,\nsome private companies have taken the lead on\nmore immediate preventive and disruptive measures,\neither unilaterally or through civil court action.\n\nEffective action against cybercrime can be achieved\nthrough well-coordinated collaboration between\nrelevant public and private actors, leveraging their\nexpertise and advantages, exploring all possible\ncourses of action and prioritizing joint action\nagainst the top threats. Private companies need\nto recognize that they have a significant role to\nplay in not only identifying criminal trends and\nactivities, but also in actively countering them, while\nlaw enforcement agencies need to acknowledge\nthe unique role private companies can play and\nembrace cooperation as a key option. By working\ntogether against cybercriminals, they can dismantle\nmalicious infrastructure, gather and preserve\nevidence for arrest and prosecution, and rescue\nand restitute lost assets.\n\n\n-----\n\nCertain disruption operations have already proven\nsuccessful. For example, in 2014, a global\neffort disabled the “GameOver Zeus” botnet\nand rescued over 1 million infected computers\nfrom criminal control. Similarly, through a publicprivate partnership in 2016, criminal control of\nthe “Avalanche” network was severed and over\n2 million infected computers were liberated.\n\n\nThese two examples show that the disruption of\na cybercriminal ecosystem substantially increases\nthe threat actors’ cost of conducting their activities,\nand protects the public. But such actions are too\ninfrequent and have taken too long. To effectively\ncombat cybercrime, disruptive operations must\nbe rapid and coordinated, applying a systematic\napproach and measuring their lasting impact.\n\n\n#### 4.2 Prioritizing disruption\n\nTo determine if disruption is the appropriate and\noptimal action, the threat should be evaluated\nto determine whether disabling the technical\ninfrastructure will mitigate or eliminate the threat.\nBut the determination is not either/or. In operations\ncoordinated by public- and private-sector actors,\na combination of traditional and disruptive\napproaches may work best. Working with the\ndisruptive model along with traditional techniques\nwill increase the costs for cybercriminals and their\nrisk of arrest. But this combination requires the\nparties involved to be pragmatic, and carefully and\nflexibly synchronizing the action to be taken.\n\nManaging and coordinating joint action raises\ncertain challenges and risks. To ensure successful\noperational cooperation, especially when the aim is\ndisruptive action, decision-makers should take into\naccount three key considerations:\n\nOperational objectives\nAt the operation’s outset, who should participate\nmust be considered first, including certain\nparticipants but possibly excluding others. Several\nfactors will make a difference in the decision:\nfor example, where the criminal actor(s) and\ninfrastructures are located, which law enforcement\nagencies are already investigating, what privatesector companies (that are tracking the threat or\nwhose services are being used by the criminal)\nhave a stake in the case, and where the victims are\nlocated. Taking into account geopolitical factors that\nmay influence the viability and eventual success of\nthe operation is also important.\n\nAfter participants are identified, they should\ndetermine the disruptive operation’s goal. The\nparticipants in this type of operation will play different\nroles and may have different goals and measures\nof success. Timely disruptions are important to\nprotect victims, and proper coordination can help\nto preserve all or most of the evidence needed\nfor prosecution. The diverse objectives can be\nreconciled, but the stakeholders must identify and\nshare their goals. They should recognize that their\nindividual goals may not be fully achievable but\nshould be willing to negotiate their role to support\nthe disruption of the criminal’s infrastructure.\n\n\nOnce it is assembled and its goals are set, the team\nwill need to sufficiently comprehend the criminal\nscheme and its infrastructure to be effective.\nTo design an effective disruption operation, the\ndecision-makers should be aware that the criminal\ninvestigation will not be the same as a traditional one.\nTraditional investigations are often narrowly restricted\nto attribution of responsibility and location of the\nunderlying criminal actor. The underlying criminal\ninfrastructure, however, is not necessarily tied solely\nto a single criminal actor or enterprise. Therefore,\nconsideration should be given to the operation’s\nappropriate scope, to achieve the biggest impact.\n\nLegal and policy factors\nTo effectively disrupt criminal infrastructure, the\njurisdiction(s) where the infrastructure is located\nshould be identified. The legal authority for a publicor private-sector entity to act in that jurisdiction then\nneeds to be clearly established. In some cases, a\npublic- or private-sector partner will inherently possess\nthe authority needed to act, although all actions\nshould be performed in compliance with human rights\nconsiderations and due process safeguards. In other\ncases, public- or private-sector actors will need to use\nthe authority of the courts. In cases where a criminal’s\ninfrastructure is located in a jurisdiction that does not\nallow coordinated action, the team may be able to\nidentify another jurisdiction that could provide the legal\nauthority to execute the disruption in a different way.\nFor example, if directly confiscating the infrastructure\nis not possible, seizing websites could be an effective\nalternative when the domain registrar is located within\nthe legal authority jurisdiction.\n\nIn addition to identifying the appropriate legal\nauthority, it is important to consider whether the\ndisruption could interfere with recognized rights to\nprivacy or privacy regulations. During the operation,\nall information sharing should occur in accordance\nwith applicable national privacy laws and\nagreements. All information should be secure, have\nlimited access and include documented procedures\nfor sharing. Therefore, relying upon existing sharing\ncentres and protocols may make sharing more\nefficient. Transparency regarding the operation, the\nlegal authorities involved and the results is essential,\nbut naming all participants may not be practical or\n\n\n-----\n\nand legitimate acts designed to disable a criminal s\ninfrastructure in order to protect the public.\n\nUnintended consequences\nMilitary wisdom suggests that “no battle plan\nsurvives first contact with the enemy”. Therefore,\nany disruptive action must take into account the\npotential for unintended consequences. Negative\nconsequences can result from dismantling a\ncriminal’s infrastructure, affecting those not involved\nin the criminal activity. For example, legitimate\nconsumers or businesses may unknowingly – often\nthrough compromise – use part of the criminal’s\ninfrastructure. Other government entities with\nlegitimate investigations related to national security\nor criminal activity could be at work. In almost all\noperations, unwitting victims who are using an\n\n\nalso have to consider their legal liability, as those\ninvolved in the disruption could be held responsible\nfor any damages. Careful consideration of possible\nunintended consequences to legitimate disruption\nactivities will help to minimize the possible damage,\nallow for proper notice and anticipate remediation.\n\nThe disruption will likely become public and, for the\nidentified team members, the publicity can result\nin retaliation by the criminals. In some instances,\na disruption could be viewed as a crime or hostile\nact. Importantly, public- and private-sector actors\nmust vigilantly monitor their systems to minimize\nany technical or financial harm and communicate\nappropriately with the public at large about what\nhas happened, while allowing stakeholders to\ncontrol their level of exposure.\n\n\n###### B O X 1 1 “How do you defeat a botnet?

In addition, the information gained from\noperations will allow victim identification and remediation\nand can protect the public from future harm.\n\nTo fully enjoy the benefits of collaborative action\nagainst cybercrime, suitable frameworks must be\nput into place to enable sustainable and effective\nrelations. Specifically, collaboration needs neutral\nand supportive spaces for considering these issues\nin a joint decision-making process.\n\n\n-----\n\n### 5\n\n\n# Partnering to combat global cybercrime\n\n\n#### 5.1 A global architecture for public-private cooperation against cybercrime\n\n\nDespite enormous investment from both the\npublic and private sectors, current global efforts\nto limit the growth of cybercrime are fragmented\nand insufficient. The systemic containment of\ncybercrime will only happen when the scope, scale\nand speed of public-private cooperation deepens,\nexpanding internationally and sustained over the\nlong term. The response to cybercrime requires an\nequally scalable approach. This section presents\nan architecture for carrying out actions based on\nthese principles, by forming a global network of\nstakeholders committed to the shared mission.\n\nIn facilitating cooperation, the problem is neither\na lack of willingness nor a shortage of operational\nplatforms. Law enforcement agencies, NGOs\n\n\nand private companies cooperate eagerly and\nfrequently. A significant number of collaborative\ninitiatives already exist, and multiple operational\nbodies dot the global cyber landscape. Instead, the\nproblem is that these efforts remain fragmented,\nunconnected and sporadic. No existing architecture\nfacilitates global, comprehensive and coordinated\nefforts against cybercrime, allows participants to act\nas equal partners, or takes into consideration both\npublic and private equities. But building on existing\nframeworks and lessons learned to date in the fight\nagainst cybercrime to shape such an architecture\ncould lead to a systematic transformation in the way\nthe respective capacities of the public and private\nsectors are leveraged, and to turning the tables on\ncybercriminals.\n\n\n#### 5.2 Building a successful architecture\n\n\nAs with many efforts in the information age, a\ngovernment-centric, hierarchical approach to\ncombatting cybercrime will not succeed. Global\npublic-private cooperation cannot be centrally\nmanaged by one organization. Regardless of other\nshortcomings, conflicting priorities among sovereign\nnations render such a structure unworkable.\nInstead, an effective architecture should take a\ndifferent form and have the following characteristics:\n\nA distributed structure: Like the internet itself,\nthe architecture should be distributed, comprised\nof autonomous elements and connected through\nmany different pathways. A distributed structure is\n\n\nthe only way to achieve the scope, scale and speed\nneeded to combat cybercrime.\n\nTrust: Trust is essential for successful cooperation.\nTrust is built up over time; nothing can replace\npersonal relationships or the confidence stemming\nfrom historical success. However, the architecture\nshould include operational processes designed\nto enhance confidence and trust when personal\nrapport has not yet been built among stakeholders.\nFor example, establishing business rules and using\ntechnology that provides stakeholders maximum\ncontrol over their data and assets enhance their\nwillingness to share.\n\n\n-----\n\nsectors, for example by illuminating potential\ndata and investigative opportunities in different\norganizations, while keeping the organization in full\ncontrol over its data.\n\nThe Cyber Defence Alliance (CDA) is currently testing\nthe use of a PET-enabled collaborative platform with\nfinancial institutions to improve their ability to identify\nfraud in data by interrogating each other’s systems\nfor suspicious cybercrime activity. If successful,\nthese trials may improve efficiency across\ninvestigation teams while maintaining appropriate\nprivacy requirements protecting the data.\n\n\nFor more information, see\nWorld Economic Forum,\nCyber Information Sharing:\nBuilding Collective Security,\nInsight Report, October\n2020.\n\n\nPrivacy enhancing technologies (PETs) are a set\nof emerging technologies that can fundamentally\nreduce the risks associated with collaboration\nand information sharing (particularly in regulated\nenvironments). Techniques, such as federated\nanalysis, homomorphic encryption and secure\nmultiparty computation, are allowing to compute\nover encrypted data and thus enabling to process\nqueries on each other’s data without ever learning\nwhat the other party’s data is.\n\nPETs can unlock enormous possibilities of joint\ninvestigations between the public and private\n\n\nFlexible design: An effective architecture must\ncover many different use cases and deal effectively\nwith regional variations. It must adapt to the varied\npublic-private relationships and cultures in different\ncommunities. What works in South-East Asia, for\nexample, will not directly apply to Europe.\n\nMultilevel: Experience shows that small, focused\ngroups are best at carrying out operational\nactivities. Further, different targets require different\nsmall-group compositions. Yet, these groups require\nlegal, technology and organizational infrastructure\nto succeed; large, permanent organizations are\nmuch more efficient at providing and maintaining\nsuch infrastructure. Thus, certain architectural\nelements need to be temporary, while others should\nbe permanent. The temporary elements come into\nexistence for a specific purpose, then expand or\ncontract as needed over the course of an activity,\nand disband. The permanent elements provide the\n“infrastructure” needed when a collaboration occurs\nin order to avoid inefficiencies or to “reinvent the\nwheel”.\n\n\nTransparent processes: Effective cooperation\nrequires processes that are transparent and\nrepeatable. These processes can be technical (e.g.\nagreeing to a standard for exchanging information),\nbusiness oriented (e.g. establishing standard\nprocedures for conducting meetings) or operational\n(e.g. deciding on the methods used to engage in and\ncoordinate actions among the members of the team).\n\nTransparent rules: The policies and business rules\ngoverning the collaboration framework should be\ntransparent and equitable (both in terms of the\nexpectations and the treatment of participants). They\nshould also incentivize team members to provide\ninformation, allocate resources and take action.\n\nEquity: The architecture should treat the interests\nof all participating organizations equally and should\nallow the goals, priorities and outcomes of a\nspecific cooperative activity to be set collectively; no\nsingle entity or side should dominate the process.\nBoth public- and private-sector team members\nshould take on leadership positions, depending on\nthe circumstances.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhat would an architecture against cybercrime\nincorporating these characteristics look like? One\nstructure suggested by the Partnership against\nCybercrime Working Group envisions a three-level\nsystem:\n\n– A global partnership, building on the existing\nForum initiative, to bring together international\nstakeholders to provide an overarching narrative\nand commitment to cooperate; foster interaction\nwithin a global network of entities that drive\nefforts to fight cybercrime; and facilitate\n\n###### F I G U R E 2 A global architecture for cooperation\n\n\nstrategic dialogues and processes aiming to\nsupport cooperation and overcome barriers in\nthe long term.\n\n– Permanent Nodes, a global network of existing\norganizations that strive to facilitate publicprivate cooperation over time.\n\n– Threat Focus Cells (TFC), short-term, missiondriven groups of partners that engage in concrete,\noperational, cooperative efforts. These cells will be\nhosted and maintained by the Permanent Nodes.\n\n\n###### Permanent Permanent Permanent Permanent Permanent Nodes Nodes Nodes Nodes Nodes\n\n\n-----\n\nA global partnership is needed to enhance\ncommitment and harness power towards\nsuccessful and rewarding collaboration, while\ninspiring renewed trust and confidence among the\nstakeholders through strategic alignment.\n\nThe partnership could be formed by building on\nthe existing World Economic Forum Partnership\nagainst Cybercrime initiative, which brings\ntogether an action-oriented community of leading\nstakeholders committed to the shared goal of\nacting collaboratively against cybercrime.\n\nThe Partnership against Cybercrime would provide\nthe needed strategic processes and would promote\nthree key objectives:\n\n– To foster a shared narrative to increase\ncommitment and affiliation\n\nLeaders in the public and private sectors need\nto recognize their responsibility and ability\nto restrain cybercrime through collaborative\naction. Private companies should commit and\ncontribute their capabilities to supporting the\ngreater good. Similarly, public agencies should\nrecognize the unique role private companies\ncan play and provide space for their leadership\nin collaborative efforts. This narrative would\nalso highlight the need for new approaches\nto combating cybercrime and the reasons\ntraditional models, even though necessary in\ngeneral, will not work in this context. Over time,\nembracing this shared narrative would allow\nstakeholders to increase their commitment and\nwillingness to cooperate as well as build trust\nand affiliation between them.\n\n– To amplify operational cooperation\n\nThe partnership would facilitate insight sharing\nand learning between the Permanent Nodes\n\n\nand stakeholders, enhancing the sustainability,\nglobal reach and effectiveness of the operational\nprocesses. The Permanent Nodes would share\nfeedback from their collaborative efforts and the\npartnership would support continuous learning\nand shared problem-solving. It would also\npromote improved cybercrime mapping, thereby\nidentifying new opportunities for cooperation,\nand would facilitate the development of shared\npriorities, as the different stakeholders will have\ndifferent perspectives on the global risks arising\nfrom cybercrime.\n\n– To improve stakeholders’ understanding of\nrespective interests, needs, goals, priorities\nand constraints\n\nMembers of the partnership would engage\nin an ongoing dialogue to better understand\ntheir different perspectives and to shed light on\nvarious elements that could potentially boost\nor hinder successful cooperation. A key effort\nwould be to explore ways to overcome the\nbarriers to cooperation, including working with\nrelevant policy-makers to better address policies\nor laws hindering effective collaboration against\ncybercrime.\n\nThis global partnership’s members would include\nthe Permanent Nodes, which would host the\ncooperative efforts; relevant national authorities;\nleading cyber-related service and platform\nproviders; large, cyber-mature private corporations;\nand highly targeted end users. The members\nwould assert their willingness to participate in\ncooperation efforts and to support the strategic\ngoals by endorsing the principles for public-private\ncooperation and the partnership’s objectives.\n\nAfter 2-3 years, the members of this partnership\nwould consider transforming it into an independent\nentity, an Alliance to Combat Global Cybercrime.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Permanent Nodes provide connectivity\nbetween the conceptual narrative developed at\nthe strategic level and the actions taken by the\nThreat Focus Cells. In particular, the Permanent\nNodes provide the capabilities needed to increase\nand sustain the Threat Focus Cells’ cooperative\nactivities over time and to keep them aligned with\nthe strategic goals. Neutral organizations, the\nPermanent Nodes would work with both public\nand private stakeholders equally, and would take\na leading role in initiating cooperative efforts and\nin incentivizing participants to provide information,\nallocate resources and take actions.\n\nTypical Permanent Nodes would be NGOs and\nnon-profit organizations that are already spurring\ncooperation between private companies and law\nenforcement agencies, such as the US National\nCyber-Forensics and Training Alliance (NCFTA),\nthe Cyber Threat Alliance (CTA), the Cyber\nDefence Alliance (CDA) and the Financial Services\nInformation Sharing and Analysis Center (FSISAC). INTERPOL and Europol, which are also\nleading international collaborations that include\nprivate companies, would also serve as important\nPermanent Nodes, allowing a much broader\nconnection with law enforcement agencies around\nthe world.\n\nThe Permanent Nodes’ key contributions would\ninclude:\n\nInfrastructure: The Permanent Nodes would\nprovide the underlying infrastructure needed to\nmake the Threat Focus Cells effective, such as\ncommunications capability, legal agreements,\nreporting mechanisms, office space, etc. Each\nactivity would not require new infrastructure\nand multiple Threat Focus Cells could use the\ninfrastructure at the same time.\n\n\nOperational rules: The Permanent Nodes would\nestablish, maintain and help enforce the Threat\nFocus Cells’ technical and non-technical operational\nrules, such as regulating the handling of shared\ninformation. These rules would require official,\nlegal arrangements, and should be transparent\nand equitable. Each Permanent Node may have a\ndifferent set of rules, depending on the nature of its\nmission and the stakeholders involved.\n\nOperational efficiency: The Permanent Nodes\nwould collaborate together to reduce the Threat\nFocus Cells’ potential overlaps or inefficiencies. They\nwould help each other identify trusted stakeholders\nto fill expertise and capability gaps, and develop and\nimplement the means to federate trust so the member\nof one Permanent Node may seamlessly participate in\nanother Permanent Node’s Threat Focus Cell.\n\nStrategic dialogue: The Permanent Nodes would\nenable the dialogue between stakeholders to ensure\na deeper understanding of the goals and priorities\nfor concrete operational opportunities. They would\nalso facilitate joint decisions on the goals of the\nThreat Focus Cells. The Permanent Nodes might\nalso ease joint decision-making processes, taking\ninto account operational objectives, legal and policy\nfactors, and unintended consequences, as well as\nother stakeholders’ concerns, such as their risk\nappetite, costs and reputational implications.\n\nIn this model, each Permanent Node would eventually\nsponsor and support many Threat Focus Cells\ncomprised of diverse participants in varying stages\nof action. Choosing which Permanent Node would\nsponsor a particular Threat Focus Cell would depend\non a variety of factors, including the Cell’s level of\nparticipant representation within a Permanent Node’s\nexisting membership or the threat’s disproportionate\nimpact on a Permanent Node’s home region.\n\n\n#### 5.6 Threat Focus Cells: The operational level\n\n\nUnder this architecture, the main operational unit\nwould be the Threat Focus Cells. These cells\nwould be temporary trust groups consisting of\nboth public- and private-sector organizations and\nthey would focus on discreet cybercrime targets\nor issues. Each cell would be sponsored and\nsupported by the Permanent Node best suited for\nthe task. The Threat Focus Cells should be able to\ndeliver operational outcomes faster than traditional\nlaw enforcement approaches — potentially in as\nlittle as 90 to 180 days. Each cell would be in\n“sprint” mode, reminiscent of the agile software\ndevelopment approach, and it would disband upon\ncompletion. While cell structures and processes\nmust be sufficiently flexible to accommodate\n\n\nthe varying needs of different collaborations,\nconsistency in a few key elements would support\nefficiency and interoperability:\n\nLeadership: Ideally, each Threat Focus Cell would\nbe led jointly by a private-sector participant, a\nlaw enforcement participant and a designated\nrepresentative of the sponsoring Permanent\nNode. The first two co-leads should be subject\nmatter experts and serve as the collaboration’s\ndriving force. The third co-chair would oversee\nthe collaboration’s administrative and supporting\nfunctions, such as systems access, logistics and\nreports, and would contribute on the substance.\n\n\n-----\n\nparticipation of the right organizations, or they will not\nachieve the desired scope and scale. At the same\ntime, too many participants can render the activity\nunwieldy or erode trust. Therefore, Threat Focus\nCells would typically include between 10 and 15\nindividual participants, based on their organizations’\nwillingness, resources and capabilities to contribute\nto the collaborative efforts. Private-sector participants\nwould typically represent organizations that can\nact to enhance cybersecurity on behalf of large\nconstituencies, that have unique access to relevant\ncybersecurity information and threat intelligence, or\nthat can contribute on an ecosystem-wide basis.\nSpecialists not affiliated with these organizations\nbut possessing needed subject matter expertise\ncould also be invited. Law enforcement members\nwould typically represent national-level agencies with\npending investigations into the cybercrime issues\nbeing considered. Other government participants\ncould come from network defence or sector-specific\nagencies, depending on the target and the nature of\nthe contemplated operations.\n\nGoals: All participants would need to agree on\nthe Threat Focus Cell’s desired outcomes. The\ngoals, priorities and outcomes for a cell should\nnot be driven by any single entity. In many cases,\nthe goal would be a culminating operation, which\ncould include an infrastructure takedown, public\n\n#### 5.7 Defining success\n\nMeasuring success in cybersecurity has always\nbeen challenging. In fact, the lack of effective,\nwidely accepted performance metrics has hindered\nthe field’s development since its inception.\nNevertheless, tracking progress is necessary to\ncorrect or adjust courses of action and report on\nsuccesses (or shortcomings). In addition, what\nconstitutes success varies over time: activities that\nare beneficial or necessary in the short term may\nbe insufficient in the long run. Therefore, identifying\nmetrics on which to focus over the short, medium\nand long terms is recommended.\n\nIn the short term (1 year), success would be\nmeasured by the ability to convene the community\nfor action and create the conditions for cooperation.\nThis step will lay the foundation for taking action.\nTo succeed in this effort, it is necessary to gather\nstakeholders in constructive and iterative dialogues\nand interactions, bridging the public-private,\noperational-policy and geopolitical gaps. One\nsimple way to gauge success is by the number of\nstakeholders embracing the shared narrative and\nthe principles for public-private cooperation.\n\nIn the medium term (2-3 years), success would\nbe measured by the number of concrete and\nsuccessful collaborative actions taken by the\nPermanent Nodes against cybercrime. This metric\n\n\nCell s aim could also be to scout a new threat.\nIdentifying and arresting cybercriminals can be\npart of a lengthy process and are subject to\nconsiderations outside a cell’s control. Thus, a longterm prosecution goal should not prevent the cell\nfrom taking other actions to protect customers and\nthe public. However, each cell would strive to help\nlaw enforcement agencies obtain the information\nand technical assistance needed to prosecute\nthose responsible for criminal activity.\n\nCollaboration methods: Initial or periodic in-person\nmeetings might be required to build trust, share\nsensitive information, establish roles, and set goals\nand timetables. The Threat Focus Cells would likely\nneed to operate using remote communication. The\nsponsoring Permanent Node would provide the\ninfrastructure and facilities to support this virtual work.\n\nOperational rules: Although the Threat Focus\nCells’ rules would vary, a few would be common to\nall cells to promote efficiency and interoperability.\nThe providing organization should clearly indicate\nhandling requirements on shared information, for\nexample, and the participants would agree to abide\nby those requirements. Additionally, participants\nshould agree not to take unilateral action prior to the\ncell’s culminating operation and to immediately raise\nany concerns to the Threat Focus Cell’s leadership.\n\nshould reflect the specific threats tackled – in\njoint actions or actions supported by different\nstakeholders. In addition, it would be necessary to\nadvocate for the policy processes that are needed\nto ensure successful and sustainable cooperation.\nSuccess does not necessarily mean a reduction\nof policy barriers, but the promotion of relevant\nsolutions.\n\nIn the long term, the goal is to reduce cybercrime to\nan economically sustainable level. But determining\nwhether the initiative has achieved this level of\nimpact will not be easy. Simple percentages are\nimpossible to calculate since the total amount of\ncybercrime in the world is not only unknown but\nis unquantifiable. As a result, gauging success will\nrequire proxy indicators. Some indicators that would\npoint towards a decrease in overall cybercrime\ninclude a decreasing number of reported incidents;\nlower estimates for the economic impact of\ncybercrime; an increasing number and frequency of\ndisruptive actions, including arrests and prosecution\nof cybercriminals; and a decreasing price for\ncriminal services (due to decreased demand) and\nan increasing price for others (due to increased\nrisk). One of the key tasks in its first few years\nwould be to identify the most relevant, measurable\nand verifiable proxy indicators and determine how\nto track them over time.\n\n\n-----\n\n# Conclusion\n\n#### Next step: implementation\n\n\nThe risk from cybercrime continues to grow,\naffecting everyone; current solutions are simply\nnot sufficient. As long as the entry barriers to\ncybercrime are critically low, people will continue to\nsuffer from its impact. Collaborative work is needed\nto make it harder for attacks to succeed and to\nmake the penalties much stronger so the costs to\nthe criminals outweigh the gains.\n\nBusinesses, governments, NGOs and international\norganizations must face the challenges associated\nwith cooperating against cybercrime head-on.\nThis report aims to help stakeholders overcome\nthe challenges and foster the operational and\nconceptual processes needed. Making them a reality\nwould be a significant step forward in this fight.\n\n\nIn the coming months, the Partnership against\nCybercrime Working Group will continue to\nprepare the implementation of these concepts and\nwiden the scope of the initiative’s efforts. Leading\ncompanies and law enforcement agencies are\ninvited to pledge their continued commitment and\nsupport to the effort to facilitate cooperation in the\nfight against cybercrime.\n\nThe suggested architecture could eventually evolve\ninto a newly envisioned, independent Alliance to\nCombat Global Cybercrime. In the interim, the\nWorld Economic Forum and key stakeholders will\nwork together to promote the desired processes\nand assess the validity of the concept.\n\nThe need to combat cybercrime is pressing and the\ntime to act is now.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### World Economic Forum\n\nTal Goldstein\nHead of Strategy, Centre for Cybersecurity\n\nNayia Barmpaliou\nHead of Public Policy and Initiatives, Centre for Cybersecurity\n\n###### Members of the Partnership against Cybercrime Working Group\n\nAccenture – Jacky Fox, Howard Marshall\n\nAmazon Web Services – Jordana Siegel\n\nBanco Santander – Oliver Gower, Thomas William Harvey, Marina Nogales Fulwood\n\nBank of America – Tomas Castrejon, Dan August\n\nBT Group – Kevin Brown, Daniel Lawrence, Alex Buckley\n\nCarnegie Endowment for International Peace – Tim Maurer\n\nCheck Point Software Technologies – Tim Otis\n\nCisco – Matthew Olney\n\nCouncil of Europe – Alexander Seger\n\nCredit Suisse – Jason Mallinder\n\nCyber Defence Alliance – Steven Wilson, Maria Vello\n\nCyber Threat Alliance – Michael Daniel, Jeannette Jarvis\n\nCybercrime Support Network – Kristin Judge, Nichole Dennis\n\nDeloitte – Rob Wainwright\n\nDXC – Mark Hughes\n\nEuropean Commission Directorate-General for Migration and Home Affairs – Cathrin Bauer-Bulst, René J.\nSteiner\n\nEuropol – Philipp Amann\n\nEY – Adam Malone, Keith Mularski\n\nForcepoint – Sean Berg\n\nFortinet – Derek Manky\n\nForum of Incident Response and Security Teams – Chris Gibson, Michael Bem\n\nGhana National Cyber Security Centre – Albert Antwi-Boasiako\n\nGlobal Cyber Alliance – Mary Kavaney\n\n\n-----\n\nHCL Technologies – Syam Thommandru\n\nINTERPOL – Craig Jones, Wookyung Jung\n\nIsrael National Cyber Directorate – Lavy Shtokhamer, Amit Ashkenazi\n\nMicrosoft – Amy Hogan-Burney\n\nNational Cyber-Forensics and Training Alliance – Matt LaVigna\n\nPalo Alto Networks – Ryan Gillis, MK Palmore, Sean Morgan\n\nPwC – Thierry Delville, Hugo Zylberberg\n\nSberbank Group/BI.ZONE – Dmitry Samartsev, Arina Pazushko\n\nSWIFT – Brett Lancaster\n\nTeam8 – Charles Blauner\n\nThird Way – Allison Peters\n\nTrafigura – Mark Swift\n\nUBS – Christian Karam, John Leo\n\nUnited Kingdom National Crime Agency – Cat Wharton, Fiona Johnson, Mike Hulett\n\nUnited States Department of Justice – John Lynch\n\nUnited States Federal Bureau of Investigation – Steven Kelly, Mike Shanahan\n\nUnited States Secret Service – Jonah Force Hill\n\nWorld Bank – David Satola, Conrad C.
