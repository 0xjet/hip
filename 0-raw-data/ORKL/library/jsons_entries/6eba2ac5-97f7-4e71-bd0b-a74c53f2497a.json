We revealed a\n[Chinese-based adversary we crypt as Anchor Panda, a group with very specific tactics,](http://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/whois-anchor-panda/index.html)\ntechniques, and procedures (TTPs) and a keen interest in maritime operations and naval\n[and aerospace technology. Last week we discussed Numbered Panda, a group that is also](http://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/whois-numbered-panda/index.html)\nbased out of China and is fairly well known to the security community, though by many\nnames. The goal in discussing that group was to illuminate the issues with the varied\nnaming systems for characterizing attackers. This week we want to make sure that we draw\nattention to the fact that there are adversaries active in computer network exploitation\nbesides those with a nexus to China.\n\n**Targeted attackers who are are not fulfilling a protracted collection requirement often**\n**go unnoticed by the larger security community. These adversaries conduct more**\ndiscreet or less-visible operations; this makes their presence and activities more difficult to\ncatch. The adversary we are focusing on this week fits into this category, and in fact has\n\n\n-----\n\nvery little to do with the objectives of the People s Republic of China. This week we are\ngoing to discuss Clever Kitten, whom, by virtue of several indicators, we have affiliated\n**with the Islamic Republic of Iran. Clever Kitten primarily targets global companies with**\nstrategic importance to countries that are contrary to Iranian interests.\n\nClever Kitten actors have a strong affinity for PHP server-side attacks to make access;\nthis is relatively unique amongst targeted attackers who often favor targeting a specific\nindividual at a specific organization using social engineering. Some attackers have moved\nto leveraging strategic web compromises. The reason for this is likely the availability of\nexploits against web browsers, which for a variety of reasons allows an attacker to bypass\nsecurity features such as Data Execution Prevention (DEP) or Address Space Layout\nRandomization (ASLR).\n\nThe technical details of these protections and subsequent bypasses is not the subject of\nthis post, and there are many great blogs and white papers available on that subject. This is\nnot to say other adversaries do not target web servers, but that this adversary seems to\n**favor targeting web servers.**\n\n## Clever Kitten’s Methods\n\n### RECONNAISSANCE\n\nA Clever Kitten attack starts with the use of a web vulnerability scanner to conduct\nreconnaissance. The scanner they favor was identified by artifacts left in web logs on\nvictimized servers. The scanner was identified as the Acunetix Web Vulnerability Scanner\nwhich is a commercial penetration testing tool that is readily available as a 14-day trial.\nClever Kitten unabashedly audits publicly facing websites looking for an exploitable page.\n\n### INSTALLATION\n\nOnce an exploitable page is identified, the actor will attempt to upload a PHP backdoor to\ngain remote access to the system. The PHP backdoor observed in these attacks is RC\nSHELL v2.0.2011.1009, which is publicly available. This adversary encrypts the backdoor\nand wraps it with an AES-256-bit function containing a password that decrypts the file when\nthe script is executed.\n\n### ACTIONS AND OBJECTIVES\n\nIn commodity-based attacks, the intent after the machine is compromised generally\nrevolves around stealing data from a database, uploading an exploit kit to deliver drive-by\nattacks, or simple defacement. In Clever Kitten’s attacks, the goal is lateral movement; this\nis an attempt to move further into the target environment in order to begin intelligence\n\n\n-----\n\ncollection. This activity is a longer tail for the actor than a spearphish; this is likely based on\nthe Clever Kitten background, which may be focused on web development/application\ntesting.\n\nIn order to move laterally, Clever Kitten may leverage additional vulnerability scanners or\nreconnaissance tools, but almost always will use a packet-sniffing utility in an attempt to\ncapture a login credential or network-based traffic that can be used to move deeper into the\nvictim organization. Clever Kitten’s goal is to eventually be able to masquerade as a\nlegitimate user by compromising credentials either through a pass-the-hash attack, or by\ndumping password hashes from a compromised host. Once these credentials are\ncompromised, Clever Kitten will authenticate as a legitimate user and slip into the noise of\nregular user authentications.\n\nUnfortunately, as we are still very much investigating Clever Kitten and their TTPs, the\nIntelligence Gain/Loss equation dictates that we not share too many indicators of these\nattacks at this time. We decided to highlight Clever Kitten for two reasons. The first is that\nthis adversary is not attributed to PRC, which we believe is important to occasionally\nhighlight, as it is not the only computer espionage actor.\n\nWithout going too deep into the rabbit hole, there are several indicators pointing to an\nIranian nexus, including language artifacts in the tool-marks used by the attacker, as well as\nnetwork activity tying this actor to a very specific location that we have high confidence in\nnot being spoofed. The second reason for highlighting Clever Kitten is that this is a rare\nsituation where we have the ability to provide an indicator around the reconnaissance\nphase of the adversaries’ activity.\n\nReconnaissance is frequently the hardest activity to identify and alert on by nature of the\nfact that targeted attackers may spend weeks or months reconnoitering a target, and by the\ntime the attack is detected and responded to, that data is not available for correlation, or it is\nso innocuous that it is impossible to tease out of logs.\n\nThe first Snort IDS rule provided below will detect Accunetix web scans, which, while in and\nof themselves are NOT indicative of Clever Kitten activity, may help organizations identify\nweb scans that may relate to a more serious problem. The second rule addresses the RC\nSHELL response that is sent from the victim in nearly every response to the attacker. The\nCrowdStrike Intelligence team received some great community feedback from the previous\nrule releases and will continue to use this feedback to deliver quality rules that can enable\nactionable intelligence.\n```\nalert tcp $EXTERNAL_NET any -> $HTTP_SERVERS any (msg:\"[CrowdStrike] Acunetix scan\"; flow: established, from_client; content:\"GET /acunetix-wvstest-for-some-inexistent-file\"; depth: 47; sid: XXX; rev: 1; )\nalert tcp $HTTP_SERVERS any -> $EXTERNAL_NET any (msg: \"[CrowdStrike] - RC\nWebshell Victim Enumeration Table Header\"; content: \"SYS</td>|0a|<td\nalign=\"center\" class=\"topt\">|0a|KERNEL</td>|0a|<td align=\"center\"\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\nclass= topt >|0a|USER</td>|0a|<td align= center class= topt >|0a|DISK\nTOTAL/FREE</td>\"; flow: established, from_server; sid: xxx; rev: 1;)\n\n## Other Iranian-based Adversaries\n\n```\n[Helix Kitten](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/meet-crowdstrikes-adversary-of-the-month-for-november-helix-kitten/)\n\n**_Curious about other nation-state adversaries?_** _[Visit our threat actor center to learn about](http://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/meet-the-adversaries/)_\n_the new adversaries that the CrowdStrike team discovers._\n\nBe sure to follow [@CrowdStrike on Twitter as we continue to provide more intelligence and](http://twitter.com/CrowdStrike)\nadversaries over the coming weeks.
