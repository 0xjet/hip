This key is\n'OgTD7co7NcYCoNj8NoYdPoR8nVFJBO5vs/kVkhelp2s=', as shown below.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Screenshot of alleged Kaseya REvil decryptor**\nWhen REvil ransomware victims pay a ransom, they receive either a decryptor that works for\na single encrypted file extension or a universal decryptor that works for all encrypted file\nextensions used in a particular campaign or attack.\n\nThe screenshot above is for a universal REvil decryptor that can decrypt all extensions\nassociated with the attack.\n\nTo be clear, while it was originally thought that the decryption key in this screenshot might be\nthe master 'operator' key for all REvil campaigns, BleepingComputer has confirmed that it is\nonly the universal decryptor key for victims of the Kaseya attack.\n\nThis was also confirmed by Emsisoft CTO and ransomware expert Fabian Wosar.\n\nThe REvil hardcoded operator public key is\n79CD20FCE73EE1B81A433812C156281A04C92255E0D708BB9F0B1F1CB9130635.\nThe leaked key generates public key\nF7F020C8BBD612F8966EFB9AC91DA4D10D78D1EF4B649E61C2B9ADA3FCC2C853.\nTherefore, the leaked key is not the operator private key.\n\n— Fabian Wosar (@fwosar) [August 11, 2021](https://twitter.com/fwosar/status/1425275409533476868?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n[BleepingComputer tested the leaked key by patching an REvil universal decryptor with the](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/c2cf2118550a0fd7f81fe9913fe36be24c03a0ae5430b94557e0ee71c550a58c/detection)\ndecryption key leaked in the screenshot.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Patching an REvil universal decryptor**\nAfter patching the decryptor, we encrypted a virtual machine with REvil ransomware\nsamples used in the Kaseya attack.\n\nAs shown in our video below, we then used our patched REvil Universal Decryptor to decrypt\nthe encrypted files successfully.\n\nSecurity firm [Flashpoint also confirmed that they could decrypt files encrypted during the](https://www.flashpoint-intel.com/blog/possible-universal-revil-master-key-posted-to-xss/)\nKaseya ransomware attack using this decryption key.\n\nWe also tried the decryptor on other REvil samples we have accumulated over the past two\nyears. The decryptor did not work, indicating it is not the master decryption key for all REvil\nvictims.\n\nIt is not clear why the Kaseya decryptor was posted on a hacking forum, which is an unlikely\nplace for a victim to post.\n\n\n-----\n\nHowever, BleepingComputer was told by numerous sources in the cybersecurity intelligence\nindustry that they believe that the poster is affiliated with the REvil ransomware gang rather\nthan a victim.\n\nRegardless of the reasons for it being posted, for those following the Kaseya ransomware\nattack, this is our first access to the universal decryptor key that Kaseya mysteriously\nreceived.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[The Week in Ransomware - May 6th 2022 - An evolving landscape](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-week-in-ransomware-may-6th-2022-an-evolving-landscape/)\n\n[Conti, REvil, LockBit ransomware bugs exploited to block encryption](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/conti-revil-lockbit-ransomware-bugs-exploited-to-block-encryption/)\n\n[REvil ransomware returns: New malware sample confirms gang is back](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/revil-ransomware-returns-new-malware-sample-confirms-gang-is-back/)\n\n[Austin Peay State University resumes after ransomware cyber attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/austin-peay-state-university-resumes-after-ransomware-cyber-attack/)\n\n[REvil's TOR sites come alive to redirect to new ransomware operation](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/revils-tor-sites-come-alive-to-redirect-to-new-ransomware-operation/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
