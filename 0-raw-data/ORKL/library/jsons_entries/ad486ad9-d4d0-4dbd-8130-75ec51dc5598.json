    "plain_text": "# Whois Numbered Panda\n\n**crowdstrike.com/blog/whois-numbered-panda/**\n\nAdam Meyers March 29, 2013\n\nLast week’s Intelligence blog post featured Anchor Panda, one of the many adversary\ngroups that CrowdStrike tracks. The adversary is the human component in an attack that\none should focus on. It is not sufficient to simply identify ‘Chinese-based hackers’; it is\nimportant to understand the adversary group that has targeted your enterprise and what\nintelligence they are there to collect. By understanding that there are multiple groups and\nthat they all have different tactics, techniques, and practices (TTPs), you can begin to\nunderstand the nature of the threat, what they are looking to collect, and raise the\noperational cost in order to make targeting your enterprise a costly and difficult endeavor.\n\nAttribution is a tricky subject with regard to incident response and intrusion investigation; it\ncan take years of research to get the home address or the location of the Technical\nReconnaissance Bureau (TRB) affiliated with the threat actor. We have to rely on the\ncategorization of the adversary and understanding their TTPs, victims, objectives, and prior\nart to fully evaluate the threat that adversary poses to us. Understanding the tasking orders\nthe adversary has received can be revealing of the adversary, who they are working for, and\ntheir future targeting objectives. If we understand that an adversary has targeted a high-tech\ncompany’s intellectual property, then when we encounter that adversary at a different\ntechnology company, we have a pretty good idea what they are after. Victims of a targeted\nattack by a “known” adversary benefit from understanding their intent in order to help gauge\nresponse and hopefully make strategic decisions about what is the appropriate\ncountermeasure. If the adversary is known to target mergers and acquisitions intelligence of\n\n\n-----\n\ncompanies involved in the Chinese market, then when that adversary shows up prior to, or\nduring, some M&A activity, the victim can begin to take actions to limit the effectiveness of\nthe compromised data, feed deceptive information or perhaps wage a formal complaint.\nWith this in mind, this week we are providing some indicators for a China based adversary\nwho we crypt as “NUMBERED PANDA.”\n\nNumbered Panda has a long list of high-profile victims and is known by a number of names\nincluding: DYNCALC, IXESHE, JOY RAT, APT-12, etc. Numbered Panda has targeted a\nvariety of victims including but not limited to media outlets, high-tech companies, and\nmultiple governments. Numbered Panda has targeted organizations in time-sensitive\noperations such as the Fukushima Reactor Incident of 2011, likely filling intelligence gaps in\nthe ground cleanup/mitigation operations. Screen saver files, which are binary executables\nand PDF documents, are common Numbered Panda weaponization tactics. One of the most\ninteresting techniques that Numbered Panda likes to use is to dynamically calculate the\nCommand and Control (C2) port by resolving a DNS. This effectively helps Numbered\nPanda bypass egress filtering implemented to prevent unauthorized communications on\nsome enterprises. The malware will typically use two DNS names for communication: one is\nused for command and control; the other is used with an algorithm to calculate the port to\ncommunicate to. There are several variations of the algorithm used to calculate the C2 port,\nbut one of the most common is to multiply the first two octets of the IP address and add the\nthird octet to that value. This is typically represented as: (A * B) + C – common values might\nbe 200.2.43.X, which would result in communication on port 443. Numbered Panda will\nfrequently use blogs or WordPress in the c2 infrastructure, which helps to make the network\ntraffic look more legitimate. CrowdStrike has observed Numbered Panda targeting high-tech,\ndefense contractors, media organizations, and western governments. The following intrusion\ndetection rules were written and tested by the CrowdStrike Global Threat Analysis Cell\n(GTAC) with performance and low false positives in mind – just remember to change the\nSignature ID (SID) in the IDS rules. Disclosure of this information went through the same\nIGL process as discussed in the [Whois Anchor Panda blog post.](http://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/whois-anchor-panda/index.html)\n```\nalert tcp $HOME_NET any -> $EXTERNAL_NET any (msg: \"[CrowdStrike]\nNUMBERED PANDA - Joy RAT Variant 1\"; flow: from_client,established;\ncontent: \"6YmV|7c 22|\"; depth: 6; sid: xxx; rev: 2; )\nalert tcp $HOME_NET any -> $EXTERNAL_NET any (msg: \"[CrowdStrike]\nNUMBERED PANDA - Joy RAT Variant 2\"; flow: from_client, established;\ncontent: \"Fyoj`U\"; depth: 6; sid: xxx; rev: 2;)\nalert tcp $HOME_NET any -> $EXTERNAL_NET any (msg: \"[CrowdStrike]\nNUMBERED PANDA - Joy RAT Variant 3\"; flow: from_client,established;\ncontent: \"yb|13|j[\"; depth: 5; sid: xxx; rev: 2;)\n\n```\nBe sure to follow [@CrowdStrike on Twitter as we continue to provide more intelligence and](http://twitter.com/Crowdstrike)\nadversaries over the coming weeks.
