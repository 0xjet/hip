    "plain_text": "Not so long ago, Kaspersky clients in the United States approached Kaspersky researchers with a request\n\nto investigate a new type of malicious software that they were able to recover from their organizations’\n\nservers. The malware calls itself Grabit and is distinctive because of its versatile behavior. Every sample\n\nwe found was different in size and activity from the others but the internal name and other identifiers\n\nwere disturbingly similar. The timestamp seems valid and close to the documented infection timeline. Our\n\ndocumentation points to a campaign that started somewhere in late February 2015 and ended in mid\nMarch. As the development phase supposedly ended, malware started spreading from India, the United\n\nStates and Israel to other countries around the globe.\n\nAll of the dozens of samples we managed to collect were programmed in Windows machine 32bit\n\nprocessor, over the Microsoft .NET Framework (Visual Basic/C#). Files were compiled over the course of\n\nthree days, between March 7th and 9th of 2015. The following chart illustrates how the group or individual\n\ncreated the samples, the size of each sample, the time of the day when each was compiled and the time\n\nlapses between each compilation.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe smallest sample (0.52Mb) and the largest (1.57Mb) were both created on the same day, which could\n\nindicate experiments made by the group to test features, packers and “dead code” implementations.\n\nLooking at the chart, it is interesting to see the modus operandi as the threat actor consistently strives to\n\nachieve a variety of samples, different code sizes and supposedly more complicated obfuscation.\n\nAlong with these different sizes, activities and obfuscation, a serious encryption algorithm was also\n\nimplemented in each one of them. The proprietary obfuscated string, methods and classes made it rather\n\nchallenging to analyze. ASLR is also enabled, which might point to an open source RAT or even a\n\ncommercial framework that packed the malicious software in a well written structure. This type of work is\n\nknown as a mitigation factor for threat actors to keep their code hidden from analysts’ eyes.\n\nDuring our research, dynamic analysis showed that the malicious software’s “call home” functionality\n\ncommunicates over obvious channels and does not go the extra mile to hide its activity. In addition, the\n\nfiles themselves were not programmed to make any kind of registry maneuvers that would hide them from\n\nWindows Explorer. Taking that into an equation, it seems that the threat actors are sending a “weak\n\nknight in a heavy armor” to war. It means that whoever programmed the malware did not write all the\n\ncode from scratch. A well trained knight would never go to war with a blazing shield and yet a stick for a\n\nsword.\n\nLooking into the “call home” traffic, the Keylogger functionality prepares files that act as a container for\n\nkeyboard interrupts, collecting hostnames, application names, usernames and passwords. However, the\n\ninteresting part lies here.\n\nThe file names contain a very informative string:\n\nHawkEye_Keylogger_Execution_Confirmed_<VICTIM> 3.10.2015 6:08:31 PM\n\n**HawkEye is a commercial tool that has been in development for a few years now; it appeared in 2014, as**\n\n[a website called HawkEyeProducts, and made a very famous contribution to the hacker community.](http://hawkeyeproducts.com/)\n\nIn the website, the product shows great versatility as it contains many types of RATs, features and\n\nfunctionality, such as the traditional HawkEye Logger or other types of remote administration tools like\n\nCyborg Logger, CyberGate, DarkComet, NanoCore and more. It seems to support three types of delivery:\n\nFTP, SMTP and Web-Panel.\n\nAs seen, the malware uses a number of RATs to control its victims or track their activity. One of the threat\n\n[actor’s successful implementations contained the well-known DarkComet. This convenient “choose your](https://threatpost.com/darkcomet-rat-used-new-attack-syrian-activists-081612/76919)\n\n\n-----\n\nvictim s machine. The DarkComet samples are more complicated than the traditional HawkEye logger.\n\nOne instance had a random key generator which sets an initialization vector of the first 4 bytes of the\n\nexecutable file and appends a random 5 byte key that unpacks another PE file, less than 20Kb in size. The\n\nPE file then contains another packer with an even more challenging obfuscation technique. The last\n\nsample we tested had still more complicated behavior. The code itself had the same obfuscation technique,\n\nthough traffic was not transferring in clear text. Stolen data was packed and sent encrypted over HTTP\n\nrandom ports. This means that the group is trying to produce other types of malicious samples with\n\ndifferent RATs.\n\nApproximately 10,000 stolen files have been collected. Companies based in Thailand and India had the\n\nlargest percentage of infected machines. By looking at the stolen credentials, it is very clear that employees\n\nsent the malware to one another, as stolen host names and internal applications are the same.\n\nThe following is the full chart, updated to May 2015:\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Malware distribution by country_**\n\nDemonstrating the effectiveness of their simple Keyloggers, one C2 (on May 15th) maintained thousands\n\nof victim account credentials from hundreds of infected systems.\n\nTo sum it up, Grabit threat actors did not use any sophisticated evasions or maneuvers in their dynamic\n\nactivity. It is interesting to see the major differences between the core development of the malware and the\n\nactual functionality it uses.\n\nSome malware samples used the same hosting server, and even the same credentials. Could it be that our\n\n\n-----\n\nmembers of the group are more technical than the others and some are more security oriented and aware\n\nof the risks they might expose themselves to.\n\n## Back to square one:\n\nFrom what we have seen so far, the malware is being delivered as a Microsoft Office Word (.doc) email\n\nattachment, containing a malicious macro called AutoOpen. This macro simply opens a socket over TCP\n\nand sends an HTTP request to a remote server that was hacked by the group to serve as a malware hub,\n\nbefore downloading the malware. In some cases the malicious macro was password protected, but our\n\nthreat actor might have forgotten that a .doc file is actually an archive and when that archive is opened in a\n\nconvenient editor of your choice, the macro strings are shown in clear-text.\n\nThe malware is in plain view, modifying commonplace registry entries, such as the startup configurations,\n\nand not covering its tracks. Its binaries are not deleted in most cases, and its communication is in clear\ntext, where the victim can sniff the communication and grab the FTP/SMTP server’s credentials.\n\nMalware derivatives are mainly located in:\n\nC:\\Users\\ <user> \\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\n\n**Phishing extensions: .doc**\n\n3f77403a64a2dde60c4962a6752de601d56a621a\n\n4E7765F3BF73AEC6E350F412B623C23D37964DFC\n\n**Icons: .pdf, .doc, .ttf, .xls, .ppt, .msg, .exe**\n\n**Stealer: .txt, .jpeg, .eml**\n\n**Additional Executable names:**\n\nAudioEndpointBuilder.exe\n\nBrokerInfrastructure.exe\n\nWindowsUpdate.exe\n\n**Malware extensions: .zip or .exe**\n\n9b48a2e82d8a82c1717f135fa750ba774403e972b6edb2a522f9870bed57e72a\n\nea57da38870f0460f526b8504b5f4f1af3ee490ba8acfde4ad781a4e206a3d27\n\n\n-----\n\n1948f57cad96d37df95da2ee0057dd91dd4a9a67153efc278aa0736113f969e5\n\n1d15003732430c004997f0df7cac7749ae10f992bea217a8da84e1c957143b1c\n\n2049352f94a75978761a5367b01d486283aab1b7b94df7b08cf856f92352166b\n\n26c6167dfcb7cda40621a952eac03b87a2f0dff1769ab9d09dafd09edc1a4c29\n\n2e4507ff9e490f9137b73229cb0cd7b04b4dd88637890059eb1b90a757e99bcf\n\n3928ea510a114ad0411a3528cd894f6b65f59e3d52532d3e0c35157b1de27651\n\n710960677066beba4db33a62e59d069676ffce4a01e63dc968ad7446158f55d6\n\n7371983a64ef9389bf3bfa8d2abacd3a909d13c3ee8b53cccf437026d5925df5\n\n76ba61e510a340f8751e46449a7d857a2d242bd4724d0d040b060137ab5fb31a\n\n78970883afe52e4ee846f4a7cf75b569f6e5a8e7a830d69358a8b33d186d6fec\n\n7c8c3247ffeb269dbf840c7648e9bfaa8cf3d375a03066b57773c48de2b6d477\n\n7f0c4d3644fdcd8ac5bc2e007bb5c3e9eab56a3d2d470bb796af88125cd74ac9\n\n**IP Addresses:**\n\n31.220.16.147\n\n204.152.219.78\n\n128.90.15.98\n\n31.170.163.242\n\n185.77.128.65\n\n193.0.200.136\n\n208.91.199.223\n\n31.170.164.81\n\n185.28.21.35\n\n185.28.21.32\n\n112.209.76.184\n\n\n-----",
