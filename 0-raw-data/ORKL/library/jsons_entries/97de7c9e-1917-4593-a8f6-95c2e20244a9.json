No So Much](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/holiday-lull-not-so-much)\nURLZone top malware in Japan, while Emotet and LINE Phishing round out the\nlandscape\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1: Relative TA544 message volume between February 2017 and June 2019_\n\n## Ursnif: The preferred malware payload of TA544\n\nUrsnif is a common banking Trojan that can:\n\nSteal stored data including passwords from banking websites via web injections,\nproxies and VNC connections\nUpdate itself or install modules remotely\n\nUrsnif has many variants and names such as Dreambot, ISFB, Gozi, and Papras; it is\ntypically distributed in high volume campaigns (hundreds of thousands or millions of\nmessages).\n\n**Ursnif 1000**\n\nUrsnif 1000, the affiliate ID that is most closely associated with TA544, is typically distributed\nin high-volume campaigns (hundreds of thousands of messages per day) that often target\nthe IT, technology, and marketing/ industries in Japan.\n\nMost Ursnif 1000 campaigns use a robust combination of geofencing techniques to verify\nthat users are located in Japan. Messages from these campaigns drop their payloads via\nMicrosoft Excel documents with macros, that when enabled, download URLZone (another\nbanking Trojan), which, in turn, download Ursnif 1000.\n\n**Ursnif 4779**\n\n\n-----\n\nUrsnif 4779 is typically distributed in moderate volume campaigns (tens of thousands of\nmessages per day) that often target technology, manufacturing, and IT verticals in Italy. Like\nUrsnif 1000, this variant is also associated with TA544.\n\nAdditionally, Ursnif 4779 shares much of its geofencing locale/language check techniques\nwith Ursnif 1000. Ursnif 4779 is deployed via one of two primary methods: (1) Microsoft\nExcel attachments with malicious macros, that, when enabled, install Ursnif along with a\ncomplex symmetric block cipher that is referred to as a “serpent key”, or (2) steganographic\nimages that conceal malicious PowerShell commands which install Ursnif.\n\n**Delivery**\n\nUrsnif delivery methods vary by circumstance, depending on the targeted vertical and\ngeography. Ursnif shares code with many other banking Trojans and the source code for an\nearlier version was distributed on online forums for free. Often, malware authors modify or\nadapt Ursnif code to serve particular purposes.\n\nUrsnif can be deployed as a primary or secondary payload. It may be delivered via\npassword-protected Zip files; Microsoft Office document attachments with malicious macros;\nor compressed JScript, JavaScripts, or Visual Basic scripts. However, the most common\nvectors for TA544 campaigns are messages with Microsoft Office documents that contain\nmacros, that, when enabled, install URLZone and/or Ursnif.\n\n**Trends**\n\nAs of 2019, Ursnif is one of the most prevalent banking Trojans in the threat landscape. In\nQ4 2018, we observed Ursnif consistently reaching peak message volume.\n\nBecause of Ursnif’s variable nature, it is difficult to identify trends in delivery strategies.\nPayload delivery is largely dependent on the threat actor, geography, and targeted verticals.\nHowever, recent TA544 campaigns typically deploy Ursnif via Microsoft Office attachments\nequipped with malicious macros that install the Ursnif banking trojan. Ursnif is sometimes\ndelivered as a standalone payload, but as in the case of TA544 with its campaigns in Japan,\nit is more often deployed with other malware including URLZone.\n\n## Objectives\n\nTA544 is a financially motivated actor that uses a variety of payloads to target both European\nand Asian geographies. Proofpoint researchers have been able to identify commonalities\nbetween the European and Asian campaigns, despite the differences in targeting and\ngeographic location.\n\nOne notable characteristic of TA544 is their use of steganography, which is the process of\nconcealing code within images. TA544 has implemented this strategy in recent Japanese\nand Italian campaigns, embedding steganographic images of pop culture references into\n\n\n-----\n\nattached Microsoft Office Documents. When the user enables the document macro, the\nobfuscated code downloads and installs malware, usually URLZone and/or Ursnif as noted\nabove.\n\n## Targeting\n\nTA544 has historically targeted Italy (ongoing), Japan (ongoing), Germany (defunct), Poland\n(defunct), and Spain (defunct). In addition to malware specifically chosen for each country,\neach region is targeted with appropriate language translations in email bodies, subjects,\nfilenames, and geographically relevant branding. Known targeted countries are listed in\nTable 1 below:\n\n**Country** **Language** **Malware** **Volume** **Verticals** **Notes**\n\n\nItaly\n(Active)\n\nPoland\n(Defunct)\n\n\nItalian Panda\n(Multiple\nVersions),\nChthonic,\nSmoke\nLoader, Ursnif\n(Multiple\nAffids)\n\n\nPolish Nymaim Medium\nVolume\n\n\nMedium\nVolume\n\n\nManufacturing and\nRetail\n\n\nProofpoint\nresearchers\nbegan\ntracking of\nTA544 with\ncampaigns\ntargeting Italy\nin February of\n2017 where it\nwas initially\ndiscovered.\nItaly has been\nregularly\ntargeted\nsince.\n\n\nManufacturing Campaigns\nbegan\nregularly in\nMarch of 2017\nand appear to\nhave gone on\nhiatus in May\nof 2018.\n\n\n-----\n\nGermany\n(Defunct)\n\nSpain\n(Defunct)\n\nJapan\n(Active)\n\n\nGerman Ursnif (1001),\nUrsnif (1002),\n\n\nJapanese URLZone\n\nUrsnif\n\n\nMedium\nVolume\n\n\nCampaigns\nbegan\nexperimentally\nin February of\n2017 and\nended in\nMarch of\n2017.\n\nCampaigns\nbegan\nexperimentally\nin August of\n2017 and\nended in\nSeptember of\n2017.\n\nCampaigns\nbegan\nexperimentally\nin December\nof 2017 using\nUrsnif and\nhave been\nregularly\ntargeted using\nURLZone and\nUrsnif as of\nJune of 2019.\n\n\nCastilian ZLoader Medium\nVolume\n\n\nHigh\nVolume\n\n\nTechnology,\n\nManufacturing, &\nHospitality\n\nTechnology,\nManufacturing &\nHospitality\n\nMarketing/advertising,\nTechnology, and IT\n\n\n_Table 1: Description of the countries with observed email campaigns._\n\n## Campaign History\n\nFigure 2 illustrates a high-level overview of TA544 campaign history in the five most\nimpacted geographies:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2: TA544 campaign history_\n\nProofpoint researchers began observing TA544 in Italy at the end of 2017, primarily\nleveraging Panda Banker. In March of 2017, TA544 briefly experimented in Germany with\nUrsnif variants but ceased activity in the region after only a short one-month period. Similarly,\nTA544 also targeted Spanish audiences with ZLoader during the summer of 2018. During\nthese experimental phases, TA544 conducted ongoing campaigns that targeted Polish\naudiences with Nymaim.\n\nBy September of 2018, TA544 began to focus its attacks on Japan, using standalone Ursnif\nvariants and/or URLZone which leads to Ursnif 1000 specifically. URLZone to Ursnif 1000\nremains the primary strategy for TA544 campaigns that target Japanese audiences. During\nthese ongoing Japanese-focused campaigns, TA544 gradually began replacing Panda\npayloads with Ursnif. The most recent Ursnif variants that TA544 uses to target Italian\naudiences are derivatives of Ursnif 4000 (4777, 4778, 4779, 4780; collectively referred to as\n4XXX).\n\n## Campaigns\n\nTA544 campaigns that target Japan often distribute messages with payment-themed subject\nlines such as:\n\n\"Re: 請求書の送付\" (\"Send invoice\")\n\"Re: 請求書送付のお願い\" (\"Request for billing\")\n\"契約書雛形のご送付\" (\"Sending the contract form\")\n\"ご案内[お支払い期限:06月18日]\" (\"Information [Payment Deadline: Jun. 18]\")\n\"請求書の件です。\" (\"Invoice\")\n\"請求書送付\" (\"Invoicing\")\n\n\n-----\n\nThese messages often contain a short, generic message about upcoming payment\ndeadlines, and typically contain Microsoft Excel Documents with macros, that when enabled,\ndownload and install URLZone and/or Ursnif 1000. These Excel document file names are\nusually a random collection of numbers:\n\n\"12345_0001.xls\" (random digits)\n\"1234_56_007.XLS\" (random digits)\n\"0001_123_4567.XLS\" (random digits)\n\n_Figure 3: An email with Microsoft Excel attachment that contains macros, that when enabled,_\n_download and install URLZone which leads to Ursnif 1000 (Japan, April 2019)_\n\nSome of these messages may also contain attached steganographic images of notable\nJapanese pop culture references. These images contain scripts that can fetch and install\nmalware (usually URLZone or Ursnif 1000) from malicious websites controlled by TA544.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4: Steganographic image that contains scripts that fetch Ursnif 1000 payloads from_\n_malicious websites controlled by TA544 (Japan, April 2019)_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5: Steganographic image that contains scripts that fetch Ursnif 1000 payloads from_\n_malicious websites controlled by TA544 (Japan, May 2019)_\n\nTA544 uses many of the same strategies to target Italian audiences. These campaigns utilize\nsimple social engineering mechanisms including payment themed subject lines.\n\nSome examples of subject lines include:\n\n\"documenti sig.\"\n\"Fattura per bonifico\"\n\"Fatturazione 123456\" (random digits)\n\"fatture scadute\"\n\nThese messages often contain a short, generic message about upcoming payment\ndeadlines, scanned invoices, or upcoming bill payments, and typically contain Microsoft\nExcel Documents with macros, that when enabled, download and install Ursnif 4XXX. These\nExcel document file names are usually a random collection of numbers paired with upcoming\ndates:\n\n\"(9)__2019__03_8765432F.XLS\" (random digit, month, random digits)\n\"20190321 D O C 98765_43.xls\" (today's date, random digits)\n\"FtDiff0000 000000D_M_S_987654.XLS\" (random digits)\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6: An email with Microsoft Excel attachment that contains macros, that when enabled,_\n_download and install Ursnif 4XXX (Italy, May 2019)_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7: Microsoft Excel attachment that contains macros, that when enabled, download_\n_and install Ursnif 4XXX (Italy, June 2019)_\n\nSome of these messages may also contain attached or linked steganographic images of\nnotable Italian pop culture references. These images contain scripts that can fetch and install\nan Ursnif payload from malicious websites controlled by TA544.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8: Steganographic image that contains scripts that fetch Ursnif 4XXX payloads from_\n_malicious websites controlled by TA544 (Italy, June 2019)_\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSince early 2017, TA544 has emerged as one of the most prolific and geographically focused\nthreat actors in the threat landscape, distributing tens of millions of malicious messages\nacross eight countries within the last two years. To date, TA544 has delivered more than six\nunique malware payloads (in several variations of each) in high-volume campaigns\n(hundreds of thousands of messages per day) to victims across western Europe and Japan.\n\nOriginally specializing in the Panda banking malware in Italy, it has since branched out to\nPoland, Germany, Spain, and Japan, using a variety of other malware including Chthonic,\nSmoke Loader, Nymaim, ZLoader, and finally URLZone in combination with Ursnif, both\nbanking Trojans. TA544 currently targets marketing/advertising, technology, and IT verticals\nin Japan, and manufacturing and retail verticals in Italy.\n\nGiven their recent behavior, we can expect TA544 to remain a prominent threat in Japanese\nand Italian geographies. There is no indication of TA544 abandoning their primary payload\ndelivery mechanism (malicious Microsoft Office VBA macros), although we have seen an\nincrease in the use of steganographic images.\n\nSubscribe to the Proofpoint Blog\n\n\n-----",
