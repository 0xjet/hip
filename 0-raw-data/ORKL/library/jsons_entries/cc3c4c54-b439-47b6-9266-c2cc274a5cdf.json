IHEATE is no different, and has its own unique behavior.**\n\n**The traffic below simulates the traffic between a IHEATE-affected machine and its C&C server. Traffic** **Email Subscription**\n\n**from the client to the server is in red; traffic from the server to the client is in blue. The C&C server has** **Your email here**\n**sent a /DISK command to the machine.**\n\n**_Figure 1. Captured IHEATE network traffic_**\n\n**The first part of the network traffic is from the client to the C&C server. It is as follows:**\n\n**1. The first six bytes make up the hardcoded portion of the encryption key. In this case, it is “36 59 6d**\n\n**56 7c 22”. We have seen different encryption keys in other IHEATE variants; in some variants this**\n\n**part is ten bytes long.**\n\n**2. The following eight bytes make up the randomly generated portion of the encryption key. Here it is**\n\n**“b0 84 e8 44 a4 55 85 c7”. In some samples, this portion is ten bytes long.**\n\n**3. The next two bytes say how long the encrypted data is, here it is “61 8a”. The contents are**\n\n**encrypted with RC4, using the randomly generated encryption key.**\n\n**4. Last is the data itself. This is also encrypted using RC4, with the hardcoded and randomly**\n\n**generated portions of the encryption key concatenated together.**\n\n**The second part is the response of the server to the client. It is described as follows:**\n\n**1. The encryption procedure is identical to that used by the client to talk to the server.**\n\n**2. The six-bit hardcoded portion of the encryption key** **_must be identical to the one used by the client_**\n\n**earlier. Otherwise, if the keys do not match, the connection is dropped.**\n\n**However, some newer IHEATE samples use yet another technique. These use asymmetric encryption:**\n\n**1. Before communicating with C&C server, the malware client generates a random session key.**\n\n**2. The client encrypts the session key using RSA-1024, using a public key hardcoded inside of**\n\n**malware.**\n\n**3. The client encrypts the data to be sent using a custom encryption routine.**\n\n**4. On top of this, the data sent to the C&C server is encrypted with RC4, using the previously**\n\n**generated session key,**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_File properties_**\n\n**The IHEATE sample with the “EMC112” identifier passes itself off as legitimate Media Player-related**\n\n**.DLL file, as can be seen below:**\n\n**_Figure 3. IHEATE pretending to be a Media Player .DLL file_**\n\n**_C&C Servers_**\n\n**IXESHE was known for using compromised hosts for its C&C servers, and IHEATE behaves similarly.**\n\n**The IHEATE sample with the “EMC112” identifier used the subdomain cknew[.]{abused domain}**\n\n**_[.]com as the location of its C&C server. This domain appears to contain the personal blog of the_**\n\n**original registrant, who has been using it since the domain was registered in 2004. We do not believe**\n**that the registrant is tied to IHEATE; instead we believe that his credentials were compromised so that**\n\n**threat actors could set up subdomains. This site was active briefly in the middle of 2015, but came back**\n\n**online at the start of 2016.**\n\n**Other IHEATE samples showed interesting behavior as well. In one case, the attackers planted a fake**\n\n**C&C server address in the code:**\n\n**_Figure 4. Fake C&C server in code_**\n\n**The address here is not an actual C&C address; instead it is used to calculate the port that the client**\n\n**will use (in this case, 443: (24*18)+11.) Other attacks are known to have used similar tactics as well.**\n\n**Other domains used by IHEATE also overlapped with servers used by IXESHE. Two domains**\n\n**(ipv6pro[.]root[.]sx and gimeover[.]psp-moscow[.]com) were used by IHEATE and resolved to the IP**\n**address 200[.]93[.]193[.]163. At approximately the same time, IXESHE also used the same server –**\n**except it did so by accessing the domain skype[.]silksky[.]com.**\n\n**_Conclusions_**\n\n**IXESHE and associated threats like IHEATE have not gone away, and they continue to evolve and**\n\n**change with the times. We will continue to monitor this threat and apprise our readers of any future**\n**developments.**\n\n\n-----\n\n### Related Posts:\n\n**[Shadow Force Uses DLL Hijacking, Targets South Korean Company](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/shadow-force-uses-dll-hijacking-targets-south-korean-company/)**\n\n**[DYRE Banking Malware Upsurges; Europe and North America Most Affected](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/old-banking-malware-resurfaces-europe-north-america-most-affected/)**\n\n**[Pawn Storm Targets German Christian Democratic Union](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/pawn-storm-targets-german-christian-democratic-union/)**\n\n**“Operation C-Major” Actors Also Used Android, BlackBerry Mobile Spyware Against**\n**Targets**\n\n**[ENTERPRISE](http://www.trendmicro.com/us/security-intelligence/enterprise-ransomware/index.html)** **»** **[SMALL BUSINESS](http://www.trendmicro.com/us/security-intelligence/small-business-ransomware/index.html)** **»** **[CONSUMER](http://www.trendmicro.com/us/home/consumer-ransomware/index.html)** **»**\n\n**Tags:** **[IHEATE](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/tag/iheate/)** **[IXESHE](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/tag/ixeshe/)**\n\n**[targeted attacks](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/tag/targeted-attacks/)**\n\n#### 0 Comments TrendLabs 1 Login\n\n**Recommend** **Share** **Sort by Best**\n\n### Start the discussion…\n\n**Subscribe** **Add Disqus to your site** **�** **Privacy**\n\n**[HOME AND HOME OFFICE](http://www.trendmicro.com/us/home/index.html)** **|** **[FOR BUSINESS](http://www.trendmicro.com/us/business/index.html)** **|** **[SECURITY INTELLIGENCE](http://www.trendmicro.com/us/security-intelligence/index.html)** **|** **[ABOUT TREND MICRO](http://www.trendmicro.com/us/about-us/index.html)**\n\n**[Asia Pacific Region (APAC): Australia / New Zealand, 中国, ⽇本, 대한민국](http://www.trendmicro.com.au/au/home/index.html)** **[, 台灣](http://tw.trendmicro.com/tw/home/index.html)** **[Latin America Region (LAR): Brasil, México](http://br.trendmicro.com/br/home/index.html)** **[North America Region (NABU): United States, Canada](http://www.trendmicro.com/us/index.html)**\n\n**[Europe, Middle East, & Africa Region (EMEA): France, Deutschland / Österreich / Schweiz, Italia, Россия, España, United Kingdom / Ireland](http://www.trendmicro.fr/)**\n\n**[Privacy Statement](http://www.trendmicro.com/us/about-us/legal-policies/privacy-statement/index.html)** **[Legal Policies](http://www.trendmicro.com/us/about-us/legal-policies/index.html)** **Copyright © 2016 Trend Micro Incorporated.
