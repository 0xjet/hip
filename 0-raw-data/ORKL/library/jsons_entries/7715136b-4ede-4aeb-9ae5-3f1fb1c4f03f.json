According to our research, it was used from 2015 to, at least, early 2020. We have\nseen Crutch on the network of a Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a country of the European\nUnion, suggesting that this malware family is only used against very specific targets as is\ncommon for many Turla tools..\n\nTurla is a cyberespionage group active for more than ten years. It has compromised many\ngovernments, especially diplomatic entities, all around the world, operating a large malware\n[arsenal that we have described in the last years.](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/03/30/carbon-paper-peering-turlas-second-stage-backdoor/#crayon-5d0255f768725183527568-1)\n\n## Attribution to Turla\n\nDuring our research, we were able to identify strong links between a Crutch dropper from\n[2016 and Gazer. The latter, also known as WhiteBear, was a second-stage backdoor used by](https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/eset-gazer.pdf)\nTurla in 2016-2017. Our analysis is based on the Crutch dropper with SHA-1\nA010D5449D29A1916827FDB443E3C84C405CB2A5 and the Gazer dropper with SHA-1\n1AE4775EFF21FB59708E8C2B55967CD24840C8D9. We identified the following\nsimilarities:\n\nBoth samples were dropped at C:\\Intel\\~intel_upd.exe on the same machine with a\nfive-day interval in September 2017\nBoth samples drop CAB files containing the various malware components\n\n\n-----\n\nThe loaders, dropped by the aforementioned samples, share clearly related PDB\npaths:\nC:\\Users\\user\\Documents\\Visual Studio\n2012\\Projects\\MemoryStarter\\Release\\Extractor.pdb and\nC:\\Users\\user\\Documents\\Visual Studio\n2012\\Projects\\MemoryStarter\\x64\\Release\\Extractor.pdb\nThe loaders decrypt their payloads using the same RC4 key:\nE8 8E 77 7E C7 80 8E E7 CE CE CE C6 C6 CE C6 68\n\nGiven these elements and that Turla malware families are not known to be shared among\ndifferent groups, we believe that Crutch is a malware family that is part of the Turla arsenal.\n\nAnother interesting observation is the presence of FatDuke and Crutch at the same time on\none machine. The former is a third-stage backdoor that we attributed to the Dukes/APT29\n[in our Operation Ghost report. However, we don’t have any evidence of interaction between](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2019/10/17/operation-ghost-dukes-never-left/)\nthese two malware families. It is possible that both groups independently compromised the\nsame machine.\n\n## Espionage activity\n\nAccording to ESET LiveGrid® data, Turla used the Crutch toolset against several machines\nof the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a country of the European Union. These tools were\ndesigned to exfiltrate sensitive documents and other files to Dropbox accounts Turla\noperators controlled.\n\nWe were able to capture some of the commands sent by the operators to several Crutch v3\ninstances, which is helpful to understand the goal of the operation. The operators were\nmainly doing reconnaissance, lateral movement and espionage.\n\nThe main malicious activity is the staging, compression and exfiltration of documents and\nvarious files, as shown in Figure 1. These are commands manually executed by the\noperators, thus not showing the automated collection of documents by the drive monitor\ncomponent described in a later section. The exfiltration is performed by another backdoor\ncommand and thus not shown in the examples below.\n\n\n-----\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n\ncopy /y \\\\<redacted>\\C$\\users\\<redacted>\\prog\\csrftokens.txt c:\\programdata\\ & dir /x\nc:\\programdata\\\n\ncopy /y \\\\<redacted>\\c$\\users\\user\\Downloads\\FWD___~1.ZIP %temp%\\\n\ncopy /y \\\\<redacted>\\c$\\docume~1\\User\\My Documents\\Downloads\\8937.pdf\n%temp%\n\n\"C:\\Program Files\\WinRAR\\Rar.exe\" a -hp<redacted> -ri10 -r -y -u -m2 -v30m\n\"%temp%\\~res.dat\" \"d:\\<redacted>\\*.*\" \"d:\\$RECYCLE.BIN\\*.doc*\" \"d:\\$RECYCLE.BIN\\*.pdf*\" \"d:\\$RECYCLE.BIN\\*.xls*\" \"d:\\Recycled\\*.doc*\" \"d:\\Recycled\\*.pdf*\"\n\"d:\\<redacted>\\*.pdf\"\n\n\n_Figure 1. Manual commands executed by the operators during the espionage phase_\n\nFinally, the operators have a certain sense of humor. At some point, they executed the\nfollowing command:\n\n1 mkdir %temp%\\Illbeback\n\n## Operators’ working hours\n\nIn order to have a rough idea of the working hours of the operators, we exported the hours\nat which they uploaded ZIP files to the Dropbox accounts they operate. These ZIP files\ncontain commands for the backdoor and are uploaded to Dropbox by the operators,\nasynchronously from the time at which the backdoor reads and executes their content.\nThus, this should show when the operators are working and not when the victim’s machines\nare active.\n\nWe collected 506 different timestamps and they range from October 2018 to July 2019.\nThey are plotted in Figure 2.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2. Working hours of Crutch operators based on the uploads to Dropbox_\n\nGiven the graph, the operators are likely to operate in the UTC+3 time zone.\n\n## Compromise / Malware delivery\n\nWe believe that Crutch is not a first-stage backdoor and is deployed after the operators have\nfirst compromised an organization’s network.\n\n[The first method consists in using a first-stage implant such as Skipper. In 2017, we saw](https://download.bitdefender.com/resources/media/materials/white-papers/en/Bitdefender-Whitepaper-PAC-A4-en_EN1.pdf)\nCrutch being deployed a few months after the computer was compromised by Skipper.\nThen, the malware operators also compromised other machines on the local network by\nmoving laterally.\n\n[The second method we have witnessed is the use of PowerShell Empire. We were not able to](https://github.com/EmpireProject/Empire)\nuncover how the malicious script arrived on the machine, but we believe it was through\nanother implant although a phishing document cannot be excluded. It should be noted that\nthe PowerShell Empire scripts were using OneDrive and Dropbox.\n\n## Crutch version 1 to 3\n\nFrom 2015 to mid-2019, the malware architecture used a backdoor communicating with\nDropbox and a drive monitor without network capabilities.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3 outlines the architecture of Crutch version 3. It includes a backdoor that\ncommunicates with a hardcoded Dropbox account using the official HTTP API. It can\nexecute basic commands such as reading and writing files or executing additional processes.\nIt persists via DLL hijacking on Chrome, Firefox or OneDrive. In some variants, we noticed\nthe presence of recovery C&C channels using either GitHub or a regular domain.\n\nThe second main binary is a removable-drive monitor that searches for files that have an\n[interesting extension (.pdf, .rtf, .doc, .docx). It then stages the files in an encrypted archive.](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v8/techniques/T1074/001/)\n\n_Figure 3. Architecture of Crutch v3_\n\n## Crutch version 4\n\nIn July 2019, we found a new version of Crutch. While we don’t have the developer’s version\nnumber, we believe it has evolved enough to qualify as version 4. This new version is an\nupdated version of the removable-drive monitor with networking capabilities.\n\nFigure 4 shows the architecture of Crutch v4. The main difference is that it no longer\nsupports backdoor commands. On the other hand, it can automatically upload the files\nfound on local and removable drives to Dropbox storage by using the Windows version of\nthe Wget utility.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4. Architecture of Crutch v4_\n\nThe working directory of this v4 is C:\\Intel where the following components are found:\n\noutllib.dll: The Crutch DLL\nfinder.exe: The genuine Outlook Item Finder from Microsoft Outlook (SHA-1:\n830EE9E6A1BB7588AA8526D94D2D9A2B491A49FA)\nresources.dll: Genuine DLL that is a dependency of finder.exe (SHA-1:\n31D82C554ABAB3DD8917D058C2A46509272668C3)\noutlook.dat: Crutch config file. It contains the Dropbox API token.\nihlp.exe: The genuine RAR utility (SHA-1:\nA92C801F491485F6E27B7EF6E52E02B461DBCFAA)\nmsget.exe: A clean version of the Wget utility for Windows (SHA-1:\n457B1CD985ED07BAFFD8C66FF40E9C1B6DA93753)\n\nAs Crutch v3, it persists using DLL hijacking. However, in this case the host application is\nan old Microsoft Outlook component that is dropped on the compromised system by the\noperators.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the past few years, we have publicly documented multiple malware families operated by\nTurla. Crutch shows that the group is not short of new or currently undocumented\nbackdoors. This discovery further strengthens the perception that the Turla group has\nconsiderable resources to operate such a large and diverse arsenal.\n\nCrutch is able to bypass some security layers by abusing legitimate infrastructure – here\nDropbox – in order to blend into normal network traffic while exfiltrating stolen documents\nand receiving commands from its operators.\n\n_[Indicators of Compromise can also be found on GitHub.
