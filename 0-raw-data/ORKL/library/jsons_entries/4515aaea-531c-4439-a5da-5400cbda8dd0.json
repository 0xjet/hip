The following list**\n\n**provides a summary of the threat actors TTPs, which we will cover in this blog:**\n\n**Actively attacking targets in Thailand, specifically government entities.**\n\n**Uses Bookworm Trojan as the payload in attacks.**\n\n**Has access to compromised servers that they use to download Bookworm.**\n\n**Known to use spear-phishing as the attack vector to compromise targets, but have access to**\n\n**compromised web servers that could facilitate strategic web compromise (SWC) as an attack**\n\n**vector in the future.**\n\n**Uses standalone Flash Player to play slideshows that contain pictures of current events in**\n\n**Thailand as decoy documents, but also use the legitimate Flash Player installation**\n\n**application as a decoy in some instances.**\n\n**Uses date codes to track campaigns or Trojan version. If date codes are indeed used for**\n\n**campaign identifiers, then the dates precede attacks or current event seen in decoys by 6 to**\n\n**18 days, which provides a glimpse into the development and operational tempo of this group.**\n\n**Use of large command and control (C2) infrastructure, which heavily favors dynamic DNS**\n\n**domains for C2 servers.**\n\n**Deployed Poison Ivy, PlugX, FFRAT and Scieron malware families.**\n\n**[Threat actors have delivered Bookworm as a payload in attacks on targets in Thailand. Readers](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2015/11/bookworm-trojan-a-model-of-modular-architecture/)**\n\n**who are interested in this campaign should start with our first blog that lays out the overall**\n\n**functionality of the malware and introduces its many components.**\n\n**Unit 42 does not have detailed targeting information for all known Bookworm samples, but we**\n\n**are aware of attempted attacks on at least two branches of government in Thailand. We**\n\n**speculate that other attacks delivering Bookworm were also targeting organizations in Thailand**\n\n**based on the contents of the associated decoys documents, as well as several of the dynamic**\n\n**DNS domain names used to host C2 servers that contain the words “Thai” or “Thailand”.**\n\n**Analysis of compromised systems seen communicating with Bookworm C2 servers also**\n\n**confirms our speculation on targeting with a majority of systems existing within Thailand.**\n\n**As mentioned in our previous blog on Bookworm, the Trojan sends a static date string to the C2**\n\n**server that we referred to as a campaign code. We believed that the actors would use this date**\n\n**code to track their attack campaigns; however, after continued analysis of the malware, we think**\n\n**these static dates could also be a build identifier for the Trojan. It is difficult to determine the**\n\n**exact purpose of these static date codes with our current data set, but we will cover both**\n\n**possibilities in the next sections. While we currently favor the theory that these dates act as**\n\n**campaign codes, we extracted the following unique date codes from all known Bookworm that**\n\n**suggests the threat actors began their campaign in June or July 2015:**\n\n**20150626**\n\n**20150716**\n\n**20150801**\n\n**20150818**\n\n**20150905**\n\n**20150920**\n\n\n## The Cybersecurity Canon: America the Vulnerable: Inside the New Threat Matrix of Digital Espionage, Crime, and Warfare\n\n**[posted by VoceComm on November 26, 2015](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/author/vocecomm/)**\n\n## People of Palo Alto Networks: Stephen Whyte\n\n**[posted by Justin Hall on November 25, 2015](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/author/justin-hall/)**\n\n## Attack Campaign on the Government of Thailand Delivers Bookworm Trojan\n\n**[posted by Robert Falcone on November 24, 2015](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/author/robert-falcone/)**\n\n## Customer Spotlight: A More Secure Cloud Means Better Service from Nexon\n\n**[posted by Leiann Bonnet on November 24, 2015](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/author/leiann-bonnet/)**\n\n## The Cybersecurity Canon: The Illusion of Due Diligence: Notes from the CISO Underground\n\n**[posted by Palo Alto Networks on November 24,](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/author/palo-alto-networks-staff/)**\n**2015**\n\n**[MORE →](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/archives/)**\n\n\n**Select a Category**\n\n**Select a Month**\n\n**[MORE →](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/archives/)**\n\n\n### 37\n\n\n-----\n\n**our previous blog, Bookworm is fairly complex based on its modular framework, which suggests**\n\n**that the threat actors would need to know the exact version of the Trojan they are**\n\n**communicating with in order to install appropriate supplemental modules.**\n\n**While a plausible premise, our data set does not fully support the hardcoded dates in Bookworm**\n\n**samples as a build identifier. To attempt to confirm the dates acting as a build ID, we extracted**\n\n**all of the modules for each Bookworm sample. We then compared the modules of each**\n\n**Bookworm sample that had the same date values. Most of the modules were identical amongst**\n\n**Bookworm samples using the same date string, but several samples had differing modules yet**\n\n**the same date string. For instance, Table 1 shows two sets of Bookworm samples with the**\n\n**“20150716” and “20150818” date codes that have completely different Leader.dll modules.**\n\n**Date Code** **Leader.dll Module** **Compile Date**\n\n**20150716** **e602a12e8173ca17ba4a0c6c12a094c1** **2015-07-18**\n\n**20150716** **4537257cb69a467a63c5a561825571f9** **2015-07-23**\n\n**20150818** **e6cb32805bc5d758a5ea1dcd3c05beb8** **2015-08-24**\n\n**20150818** **7065c709dd9dc7072dd5a5e2904c2d78** **2015-08-31**\n\n**Table 1 Two sets of Bookworm samples that share a sttic date cod but have different Leader**\n\n**modules**\n\n**If the Bookworm developers used the date code as a build identifier, it would suggest that a new**\n\n**date code would have been added to samples using the new Leader module. Due to these**\n\n**changes without a new date string, we believe the date codes are used for campaign tracking**\n\n**rather than a Bookworm build identifier. Unit 42 will continue to compare the date codes to the**\n\n**Bookworm modules in future samples and will modify our assessment if indications suggest the**\n\n**date string is indeed a build identifier.**\n\n**We believe that Bookworm samples use the static date string as campaign codes, which we**\n\n**used to determine the approximate date of each attack that we did not have detailed targeting**\n\n**information. We also compared these campaign codes to the date the attacks occurred or the**\n\n**date of the event seen in decoy documents to get a sense of the threat group’s internal**\n\n**operations.**\n\n**A number of the Bookworm samples include a decoy that is opened during installation of the**\n\n**malware in an attempt to disguise the compromise. The threat actors have used two types of**\n\n**decoys thus far: a legitimate Flash Player installation application and a standalone Flash**\n\n**application to display a photo slideshow. The use of a Flash Player installer, seen in Figure 1,**\n\n**suggests that the threat actors are using social engineering to instruct the victim to update or**\n\n**install the Flash Player application. The Bookworm campaign code “20150818” was used in all**\n\n**samples associated with these legitimate Flash Player installers.**\n\n**Figure 1 Adobe Flash Player Installer used as a Decoy**\n\n**Unit 42 has witnessed six decoy slideshows used in a Bookworm campaign targeting Thailand.**\n\n**All six of these decoy slideshows contain pictures that in some manner relate to Thailand. One**\n\n**known decoy includes an animation of what appears to be children in Thailand going to temple**\n\n**(Figure 2), which is associated with a spear-phishing attack on a branch of the Thailand**\n\n**government that occurred on July 27, 2015. The decoy’s filename is “wankaophansa.exe” that**\n\n**suggests the animation is regarding Wan Kao Phansa, which is a term for first day of the three**\n\n**month long rainy season. Wan Kao Phansa is a national holiday in Thailand, which in 2015**\n\n**started on July 31. The attack occurred four days before the actual holiday and had a campaign**\n\n**code of “20150716” which is eleven days before the attack took place**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 2 Decoy slideshow of children in Thailand celebrating Wan Kao Phansa**\n\n**or Buddhist Lent**\n\n**We do not have detailed targeting information on the attacks that delivered the remaining five**\n\n**decoy slideshows. To determine the approximate date of these attacks, we compared the**\n\n**Bookworm campaign code associated with each decoy slideshow and found that they coincide**\n\n**with the timeline of events seen in the photos in the decoy slideshows.**\n\n**Three of the decoys analyzed are related to the August 17, 2015 bombing near the Erawan**\n\n**Shrine in Bangkok, Thailand, as seen in Figures 3, 4 and 5. The campaign code “20150801” is**\n\n**associated with the decoy slideshow showing the graphic Erawan Shrine bombing (Figure 3),**\n\n**which is 16 days before to the actual event took place.**\n\n**Figure 3 Picture from Decoy Slideshow showing Erawan Shrine Bombing in Bangkok**\n\n**(http://metro.co.uk/2015/08/17/huge-explosion-in-central-bangkok-near-major-tourist-**\n\n**attraction-5347076/)**\n\n**The second bombing-related decoy, seen in Figure 4 contained pictures of the arrest of a**\n\n**bombing suspect named Adem Karadag. This arrest was made on August 29, 2015, which is 11**\n\n**days after the campaign code “20150818” that was associated with the decoy slideshow.**\n\n**Figure 4 Picture from a Decoy Slideshow Showing the Arrest of a Bomber**\n\n\n-----\n\n**for Thai police, which in this particular case took place on September 26, 2015. The campaign**\n\n**code “20150920” is associated with this decoy, which is six days before the actual event took**\n\n**place.**\n\n**Figure 5 Picture from Decoy Slideshow of Erawan Shrine Bombing Suspect at**\n\n**the Crime Scene**\n\n**Another decoy slideshow associated with the Bookworm attack campaign contains photos of an**\n\n**[event called Bike for Dad 2015. Bike for Dad is a cycling event that will be held on December 11,](https://bikefordad2015.com/)**\n\n**2015 to commemorate the King of Thailand Bhumibol Adulyadej’s 88th birthday. Many high**\n\n**profile figures in Thailand are promoting this event, such as the Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-**\n\n**cha who is seen in many of images in the decoy slideshow (Figure 6).**\n\n**Figure 6 Decoy Slideshow with Pictures Regarding Bike for Dad 2015**\n\n**[(http://www.m-society.go.th/ewt_news.php?nid=15002)](http://www.m-society.go.th/ewt_news.php?nid=15002)**\n\n**The campaign code “20150920” is associated with this decoy, which is a week prior to media**\n\n**articles announcing that the Crown Price of Thailand Maha Vajiralongkorn will lead the Bike for**\n\n**Dad 2015 event. At first, we believed the use of the Bike for Dad 2015 event was unrelated to**\n\n**the previous Erawin Shine bombing decoys. According to the same announcement article, the**\n\n**Crown Prince said that the bike route would pass the Ratchaprasong intersection, which is**\n\n**where the Erawin Shine bombing took place. Therefore, the threat actors using this within their**\n\n**social engineering attempts continues to follow the theme involving the bombing of the shrine in**\n\n**Bangkok, as it is undoubtedly still in the hearts and minds of the Thai people.**\n\n**The final remaining known decoy includes photos of Chitpas Tant Kridakon (Figure 7), who is**\n\n**known as heiress to the largest brewery in Thailand. Chitpas is heavily involved with Thailand**\n\n**politics and was a core leader of the People’s Committee for Absolute Democracy (PCAD),**\n\n**which is an organization that staged anti-government campaigns in 2013 and 2014. As recently**\n\n**as September 2015, Chitpas has been in the news for her attempts to become an officer in the**\n\n**Royal Thai Police force, which has caused protests due to her political stance. Two of the**\n\n**[images in the slideshow can be seen in an article that was published on September 20, 2015.](http://www.dailynews.co.th/crime/349204)**\n\n**These images were associated with the Bookworm campaign code “20150905”.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 7 Picture of Chitpas Tant Kridakon included in a Decoy Slideshow**\n\n**By comparing the campaign codes with the dates of known attacks or the date of the events**\n\n**shown in the decoys, we found that the campaign codes precede the attack or event dates by 6**\n\n**to 18 days. The campaign code date preceding the attack or associated events suggests that**\n\n**the threat actors perform development operations on their tools and then choose their decoy.**\n\n**These decoy documents also suggest that the threat actors actively track current news events**\n\n**and use photographs from the media to create their decoy slideshows.**\n\n**Unit 42 analyzed the systems communicating with the Bookworm C2 domains and found that a**\n\n**majority of the IP addresses existed within autonomous systems (ASN) located in Thailand. The**\n\n**pie chart in Figure 8 shows that the vast majority (73%) of the hosts are geographically located**\n\n**in Thailand, which matches the known targeting of this threat group. We believe that the IP**\n\n**addresses from Canada, Russia and Norway are analysis systems of antivirus companies or**\n\n**security researchers. The IP addresses in South Korea prove interesting and could suggest that**\n\n**this threat group has carried out an attack campaign on targets in locale as well. However,**\n\n**we’ve found no additional evidence to corroborate this theory.**\n\n**Figure 8 The Unique IP Addresses Seen Communicating with Bookworm C2 Emphasizes**\n\n**Attacks on Targets in Thailand**\n\n**We took the IP addresses seen communicating with Bookworm C2 servers and obtained their**\n\n**geographic coordinates using an IP geolocation database and plotted them on a map, as seen**\n\n**in Figure 9. A majority of the IP addresses in Thailand have coordinates in the Bangkok**\n\n**metropolitan area, with one in the southern town of Pattini and one in the Phanat Nikhom**\n\n**District of the Chonburi Province. IP geolocation systems are not perfectly accurate, but the**\n\n**data suggests that most of the compromised hosts exist near the largest city of Bangkok. This**\n\n**grouping of compromised hosts also aligns with the known targeting, as Bangkok and**\n\n**Nonthaburi is where a majority of the government of Thailand exists.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 9 Map Showing GeoIP Locations of Compromised Hosts Grouped in the Bangkok**\n\n**Metropolitan Area**\n\n**Bookworm-related infrastructure created by threat actors mainly involves the use of dynamic**\n\n**domains, however, an early sample used a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) owned by the**\n\n**actor. The actors also appear to have access to legitimate servers that they use to host**\n\n**Bookworm and other related tools for attacks. Overall, the Bookworm infrastructure overlaps**\n\n**with the infrastructure hosting C2 servers used by various attack tools, including FFRAT, Poison**\n\n**Ivy, PlugX, and others.**\n\n**Unit 42 has seen threat actors hosting Bookworm and other related tools on legitimate websites,**\n\n**which suggests the actors have unauthorized access to these servers. We have witnessed**\n\n**Bookworm samples hosted on a website belonging to the following organizations:**\n\n**Two branches of government in Thailand**\n\n**Thai Military**\n\n**A Taiwanese Labor Association**\n\n**Three of the four compromised webservers have been breached in the past with each being**\n\n**[listed on Zone-h as being defaced, while the remaining site was defaced by the](https://www.zone-h.org)**\n\n**TURKHACKTEAM, according to a Google cache from November 11, 2015. The specific details**\n\n**of how the actors gained access to these sites is unclear, however, one site has a publicly**\n\n**accessible form that would allow visitors to upload files to the webserver (Figure 8). Unit 42**\n\n**believes that threat actors could have uploaded Bookworm to this server using this form. It is**\n\n**also possible that the threat actors uploaded an ASP shell to gain further control over this**\n\n**webserver. We also speculate that these threat actors may use strategic web compromises**\n\n**(SWC) as an attack vector in future campaigns using their unauthorized access to webservers.**\n\n**Figure 10 Publicly Accessible Form to Upload Files to Server Seen Hosting Bookworm Trojan**\n\n**The site hosting this file upload form belongs to one of the organizations targeted with**\n\n**Bookworm. This may suggest that the threat actors used this webserver to pivot from the**\n\n**webserver into the internal network.**\n\n**The domains hosting Bookworm C2 servers (see Indicators of Compromise section of our**\n\n**[Bookworm blog) connect to a larger infrastructure that the threat actors are using to host C2](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2015/11/bookworm-trojan-a-model-of-modular-architecture/)**\n\n**servers for other tools in their toolset. So far, Unit 42 has seen infrastructure overlaps with**\n\n**[servers hosting C2 servers for samples of the FFRAT, PlugX, Poison Ivy and Scieron Trojans,](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2014-072320-5920-99)**\n\n**suggesting that the threat actors use these tools as the payload in their attacks.**\n\n**Unit 42 enumerated the threat infrastructure related to Bookworm and created a chart to**\n\n**visualize connected entities to its current attack campaign. The infrastructure is fairly complex**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 11 Infrastructure Overlaps connecting Bookworm to samples of the PlugX, Poison Ivy**\n\n**and FFRAT Trojans**\n\n**The overlap between Bookworm, PlugX and Poison Ivy samples involves the use of the Smart**\n\n**Installer Maker, which is a common technique used by this threat group. In one particular case, a**\n\n**sample of the Smart Installer Maker (MD5: 6741ad202dcef693dceb98b0a10c49fc) installed both**\n\n**a PlugX and Poison Ivy Trojan that communicated with domains that resolved to an IP address**\n\n**(119.205.158.70) that also resolved a Bookworm C2 domain (sswmail.gotdns[.]com). This IP**\n\n**address was also used to resolve a domain (qemail.gotdns[.]com) that actors used to host a C2**\n\n**server for another Trojan known as FFRAT. We observed another direct overlap in a C2 domain**\n\n**(ubuntudns.sytes[.]net) used for both Bookworm and FFRAT.**\n\n**As previously mentioned, the infrastructure related to Bookworm is fairly complex with many**\n\n**connections to domains hosting C2 servers for other tools.
