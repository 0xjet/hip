ThreatConnect Research identified several probable Ryuk domains\nbased on consistencies with infrastructure identified in Incident 20200930A: Domains\nRegistered Through MonoVM Used with Cobalt Strike and other recent incidents. Those\nconsistencies include naming similarities, registration through NameCheap, and reuse of the\nsame CIDR blocks for hosting. However, those consistencies are not unique and SSL\ncertificates have not been created for most of the domains, nor do we have any information\non Cobalt Strike or Bazar communicating with this infrastructure. New SSL certificates or\nrelevant malicious file behavior consistent with the previously identified infrastructure would\nhelp increase our confidence in the assessed relationship to Ryuk. The identified\ninfrastructure include the following:\n\nThe identified infrastructure includes the following:\n\n[viewdrivers[.]com (prev.](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/host.xhtml?host=viewdrivers.com&owner=Common%20Community) [188.116.36[.]155,](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/address.xhtml?address=188.116.36.155&owner=Common%20Community) [45.153.240[.]222)](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/address.xhtml?address=45.153.240.222&owner=Common%20Community)\n\n[service1updater[.]com (prev.](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/host.xhtml?host=service1updater.com&owner=Common%20Community) [185.117.75[.]193,](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/address.xhtml?address=185.117.75.193&owner=Common%20Community) [45.153.240[.]178)](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/address.xhtml?address=45.153.240.178&owner=Common%20Community)\n\n[godofservice[.]com (prev.](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/host.xhtml?host=godofservice.com&owner=Common%20Community) [194.36.188[.]154,](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/address.xhtml?address=194.36.188.154&owner=Common%20Community) [45.153.240[.]246)](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/address.xhtml?address=45.153.240.246&owner=Common%20Community)\n\n[driverdwl[.]com (prev.](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/host.xhtml?host=driverdwl.com&owner=Common%20Community) [194.36.188[.]45,](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/address.xhtml?address=194.36.188.45&owner=Common%20Community) [45.153.240[.]220)](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/address.xhtml?address=45.153.240.220&owner=Common%20Community)\n\n[driver1updater[.]com (45.153.240[.]157)](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/host.xhtml?host=driver1updater.com&owner=Common%20Community)\n\n[driver1master[.]com (45.153.240[.]194)](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/host.xhtml?host=driver1master.com&owner=Common%20Community)\n\n[checktodrivers[.]com (45.153.240[.]240)](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/host.xhtml?host=checktodrivers.com&owner=Common%20Community)\n\n[boost-yourservice[.]com (45.153.240[.]138)](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/host.xhtml?host=boost-yourservice.com&owner=Common%20Community)\n\n[backup1master[.]com (45.153.240[.]136)](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/host.xhtml?host=backup1master.com&owner=Common%20Community)\n\n[backup1helper[.]com (prev.](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/host.xhtml?host=backup1helper.com&owner=Common%20Community) [45.153.240[.]133,](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/address.xhtml?address=45.153.240.133&owner=Common%20Community) [45.153.241[.]1)](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/address.xhtml?address=45.153.241.1&owner=Common%20Community)\n\nWe identified several additional possible Ryuk domains based on consistencies with Incident\n20200930A. At least two of the domains were also identified in behavioral information for\nCobalt Strike executables, similar to those in the aforementioned Incident. The domains’\nconsistencies include naming similarities, registration through NameCheap, and reuse of the\nsame CIDR blocks for hosting.
