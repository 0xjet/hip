The goal of ICS-CERT is to reduce industrial control systems (ICS) risks within and across all critical infrastructure sectors by coordinating efforts among Federal, state, local, and tribal governments, as well as industrial control systems owners, operators, and vendors. ICS-CERT coordinates activities to reduce the likelihood of success and the severity of the impact of cyber-attacks against critical infrastructure control systems.\n\n This report provides trend analysis for all vulnerabilities reported to ICS-CERT in FY 2015. Most notably, researchers found that 52 percent came from improper input validation and permissions, privileges, and access controls. While this high percentage may indicate a pressing cy- bersecurity gap, it is also possible that it merely reflects the type of vu - nerabilities targeted by researchers reporting to ICS-CERT. The majority of reported vulnerabilities for FY 2015 came from the Energy, Critical Manufacturing, and Water and Wastewater Sectors.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### CONTENTS\n\n###### 1.

SCOPE­\n\nThe intent and scope of this report is to provide a summary of the Department of Homeland\nSecurity’s (DHS) National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) / Industrial\nControl Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team (ICS-CERT) vulnerability coordination efforts\nperformed in FY 2015.\n\n#### 2. ICS-CERT VULNERABILITY HANDLING PROCESS\n\nThe ICS-CERT vulnerability handling process involves five basic steps:\n\n**1. ­­** **Detection and Collection: ICS-CERT obtains vulnerability information in three ways: ICS-CERT**\nvulnerability analysis, monitoring public sources of vulnerability information, and direct notification of vulnerabilities to ICS-CERT by vendors and independent security researchers. After\nreceiving a report, ICS-CERT will perform an initial surface analysis in order to eliminate duplicate reports and false alarms. ICS-CERT then combines and catalogs the remaining vulnerability\nreports with all private and publicly available information.\n\n**2.** **Analysis: Once ICS-CERT has catalogued the vulnerabilities, vendor and ICS-CERT analysts**\nwork to understand the vulnerabilities by examining and identifying the issues, as well as the\npotential threat.\n\n**3.** **Mitigation Coordination: After validating a reported vulnerability, ICS-CERT will continue to**\nwork with the vendor on mitigation, including possible patch issuance. Researchers then have the\nopportunity to validate solutions prior to publication.\n\n**4.** **Application of Mitigation: ICS-CERT will work with the vendor to allow sufficient time for end**\nusers to obtain, test, and apply mitigation strategies prior to disclosure. This time window is vari­\nable depending on the circumstances of the vulnerability and the impact to critical infrastructure.\n\n**5.** **Disclosure: After gathering the technical and threat information related to the vulnerability,**\nICS-CERT will notify asset owners about the vulnerability through the publication of an\nICS-CERT advisory.\n\nICS-CERT attempts to coordinate all reported vulnerabilities with the associated vendor. While the\ngoal of ICS-CERT efforts is the timely sharing of vulnerability information, a number of factors may\naffect the schedule of disclosure. These factors may include the following:\n\n###### • The severity of the vulnerability,\n\n • Its potential impact to critical infrastructure, public health, and safety,\n\n • The availability of immediate mitigations,\n\n • Whether the information has already been publicly released, and\n\n • The vendor’s estimation of time required for the creation, test, and application of a\n patch or upgrade.\n\nIn cases where a vendor is unresponsive, or will not establish a reasonable timeframe for remediation,\nICS-CERT may disclose vulnerabilities, regardless of the existence or availability of patches or work­\narounds from the associated vendors.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis section provides additional detail regarding the development and improvement of ICS-CERT\ncapabilities in FY 2015, including total vulnerability reports, key researchers, and time from vulnerability\nidentification to the successful closure of vulnerability reports.\n\n#### 3.1   Vulnerability Reporting and Resolution\n\nICS-CERT receives vulnerability reports from vulnerability researchers, industrial control system\n(ICS) vendors, and national Computer Emergency Readiness Team’s (CERT). ICS-CERT opens a ticket\nwhen someone reports a vulnerability. ICS-CERT serves as the facilitator between vulnerability research­\ners and the associated vendor. After the opening of a ticket, vendors will typically validate the vulnerabil­\nity and create a patch or other mitigations, which the researcher may then validate. After validation of the\nmitigation, vendors will distribute the patch to their customers. ICS-CERT will not release an advisory\ndescribing the vulnerability until after the vendor’s customers have been given time to patch their systems\n(this period is known as a “patch window”). If appropriate, ICS-CERT will publish an alert before the\nvendor has released a mitigation. For example, if someone has already released information about the vul­\nnerability ICS-CERT will publish an alert before the patch window. After a patch window has expired or,\nalternatively, if it is evident that the vendor will not provide mitigation, the ticket is closed (“resolved”). ­­\n\nAdvisories provide timely information about current security issues, vulnerabilities, and exploits. An\nICS-CERT [advisory is intended to provide awareness to or solicit feedback from critical infrastructure](https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/advisories)\nowners and operators concerning ongoing cyber events or activities with the potential to impact critical\ninfrastructure computing networks. An advisory contains information from the researcher’s initial report,\nvalidation of the vulnerability, a description of the vulnerability including exploitation impact, and mitigations steps that asset owners can apply. ICS-CERT issues an advisory after the vulnerability coordination\nprocess has occurred. This means the researcher has contacted ICS-CERT before issuing a public notific tion of their findings.\n\nICS-CERT intends for its [alerts](https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/alerts) to provide timely notification to critical infrastructure owners and\noperators concerning threats or activity with the potential to impact critical infrastructure computing\nnetworks. ICS-CERT produces alerts based on a vulnerability discovery and the vendor’s validation and\nuses them to rapidly disseminate information about a vulnerability that someone has publicly released\nwithout coordination.\n\nIn 2015, ICS-CERT produced 197 advisories with 22 initially published to the United States Comput­\ner Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) Portal and 16 alerts with four initially published to the Portal.\nFigure 1 shows the number of alerts and advisories published by ICS-CERT from FY 2010 through FY\n2015, and Figure 2 shows the number of tickets resolved for the same period.\n\n\n-----\n\n63 Advisories\n\n52 Alert\n\n40\n\n38\n\n50\n\n18\n\n22 16\n\n0 2\n\n0\n\n2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015\n\nFigure 1.

Number of tickets created and resolved by ICS-CERT from FY 2010 through FY 2015.\n\nThe increase in the number of vulnerabilities reported is significantly la ger than the tickets created.\nThe disparity is a result of researchers conducting an in-depth assessment prior to submitting a vulnera­\nbility report. In the course of its work, ICS-CERT may create tickets that it later merges or eliminates be­\ncause of issues of applicability. Figure 3 shows the number of ICS vulnerabilities reported to ICS-CERT\nin FY 2015.\n\n\n300\n\n250\n\n239\n\n189 198 [201]\n\n200\n\n163 164 177\n152\n\n145\n\n150\n\n100\n\n25\n\n50 43 28\n\n3\n\n0\n\n2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015\n\n\n-----\n\n190 Vulnerabilities\n\n200\n\n100\n\n37\n0\n\n0\n\n2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015\n\n###### Figure 3. Number of vulnerabilities reported to ICS-CERT 2009 through FY 2015.\n\nIndependent researchers report vulnerabilities directly to ICS-CERT, which helps coordinate com­\nmunications between the researcher and vendor. As previously mentioned, ICS-CERT will not publish\nan advisory with vulnerability details until the vendor has released a fix to its customers. The following\nfigures display the length of time from when ICS vendors received notification of vulnerabilities unti\ntheir tickets were resolved (Figure 4).\n\n\n500\n\n427\n\n400\n\n300\n\n245\n\n209 203\n190\n\n200\n\n100\n\n37\n0\n\n0\n\n2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Number of Days for Ticket Resolution\n\n\n0-50 days (4 percent)\n50-100 days (2 percent)\n\n100-150 days (10 percent)\n\n150-200 days (17 percent)\n\n150-200 days (15 percent)\n>200 days (12 percent)\n\n100-150 days (14 percent)\n\n100-150 days (14 percent)\n\n150-200 days (7 percent)\n\n\n150-200 days (3 percent)\n\n100-150 days (8 percent)\n\n50-100 days (12 percent)\n\n>200 days (12 percent)\n\n150-200 days (13 percent)\n\n\n2010\n\n2012\n\n\n>200 days\n(20 percent)\n\n0-50 days\n(57 percent)\n\n\n>200 days\n(67 percent)\n\n\n100-150 days (16 percent) 50-100 days\n(25 percent)\n\n2014\n\n>200 days (21 percent)\n\n0-50 days\n(36 percent)\n\n150-200 days (18 percent)\n\n50-100 days\n(17 percent)\n\n100-150 days (8 percent)\n\nFigure 4.

The Vulnerability Coordination Team closed 35 tickets older than 365 days in FY 2015.\nThis represents 76 percent of the tickets open for over 365 days. This success is attributable to elevating\nthe visibility of the vulnerability to the vendor’s management level.\n\n\n0-50 days\n(34 percent)\n\n50-100 days\n(25 percent)\n\n\n-----\n\nSome vulnerability researchers publish vulnerabilities without giving the vendor a chance to provide\nmitigation to its customers. The general trend, however, is that more ICS vulnerability researchers are\nwaiting to publish vulnerabilities that could impact critical infrastructure until the vendor has had an op­\nportunity to mitigate them.

In addition, ICS-CERT collaborates\nwith international and private sector CERTs, such as the Japan CERT, ICST (Taiwan National Informa­\ntion and Communication Taskforce), and Siemens ProductCERT. The vulnerability researchers who have\nreported the most vulnerabilities in FY 2015 to the ICS-CERT are listed below:\n\n###### • Rupp, Maxim 28\n\n • Sanchez, Ivan 13\n\n • Bolshev, Alexander 11\n\n • Sood, Aditya K 10\n\n • Darshanam, Praveen 7\n\n • Ganeshen, Karn 6\n\n • Wightman, Reid 4\n\n • Jartelius, Martin 3\n\nOnly three independent researchers from previous years have submitted vulnerabilities in FY 2015:\n\n###### • Rios, Billy;\n\n • Crain, Adam; and\n\n • Brown, Jeremy.\n\n\n92.8\n\n100\n\npercent\n\n83.6\npercent\n\n80 80.6\n\npercent\n\n72.0 71.5\npercent percent 68.8\n\n60 percent\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015\n\n\n-----\n\ning vendors are ranked in order of vulnerabilities they self-reported in FY 2015:\n\n1.

SEVERITY OF ICS VULNERABILITIES\n\n[The security industry standard for scoring the severity of a vulnerability is the Common Vulnerability](http://www.first.org/cvss)\n[Scoring System (CVSS). ICS-CERT gives vulnerabilities a CVSS score to help asset owners assess the](http://www.first.org/cvss)\nrisk a given vulnerability poses to their organization. Figure 8 shows the percentage of ICS vulnerabilities\nwith low, medium, and high CVSS scores. Figure 7 shows that the average CVSS scores reported to\nICS-CERT dropped from 8.50 in FY 2010 to 6.85 at the end of FY 2015.\n\n##### Severity of ICS Vulnerabilities\n\n\nFY 2014\n\n\nFY 2015\n\n\nLow (0-3.9) (.4 percent)\n\n\nLow (0-3.9) (8 percent)\n\n\nMedium\n(4-6.9) High\n(29 percent) (7-10)\n(43 percent)\n\nHigh Medium\n(7-10) (4-6.9)\n(70.6 percent) (49 percent)\n\nFigure 6.

The changes from previous years show an increase in all types with the exception of improper\ninput validation.\n\nImproper input validation vulnerabilities occur when software does not validate input properly;\nan attacker is able to craft the input in a form that is not expected by the rest of the application. This can\nlead to parts of the system receiving unintended input, which may result in altered control flo, arbitrary\ncontrol of a resource, or arbitrary code execution.\n\nPermissions, privileges, and access control is when an authorization policy is defined, individual or\nsets of users are defined, and applications or processes that can perform actions on a resource such as a\ndatabase are defined. This can be very granular with an authorization policy. Administrators can control\ncertain actions, such as whether individuals or groups can read, create, modify (write), or delete.\n\nImproper control of a resource vulnerabilities occur when the software does not maintain, or incor­\nrectly maintains, control over a resource throughout its lifetime of creation, use, and release.\n\n[Credentials management is a broad administrative area that deals with identifying individuals in a](http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/answer/A-broader-definition-of-identity-governance)\nsystem and controlling their access to resources within that system by associating user rights and restric­\ntions with the established identity.\n\nIndicator of poor code quality vulnerabilities occur when the code has features that do not directly\nintroduce a weakness or vulnerability, but indicate that the product has not been carefully developed or\nmaintained.\n\n#### ICS Vulnerabilities\n\n\nFY 2010-2014\n\nCryptographic Issues\n(1 percent)\n\nIndicator of Poor Code\nQuality (5 percent)\n\nCredentials Management\n(18 percent)\n\nImproper Credentials\nInput Validation Management\n(44 percent) (19 percent)\n\nImproper Control\nof a Resource\n(12 percent)\n\nPermissions, Privileges,\nand Access Controls\n(20 percent)\n\nFigure 9.

CONCLUSION/SUMMARY\n\nSince its establishment, ICS-CERT has actively worked toward improving and enhancing cybersecu­\nrity postures within the ICS community by sharing control systems-related security incidents and mitiga­\ntion measures. During this time, the group has become more effective and efficient sharing threat informa­\ntion and coordinating vulnerability alerts with researchers, vendors, and the ICS community at large.\n\nAs the ICS community continues to adopt new technology, it is imperative that public and private\npartnerships continue to work toward the improved situational awareness of the community as a whole.\nICS-CERT urges organizations and asset owners to continue to monitor ICS-CERT advisories and alerts\nand implement mitigation strategies that will improve the cybersecurity of the nation’s critical infrastruc­\nture.\n\n\n-----\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security\n\nOffice of Cybersecurity and Communication\n\n[National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center](https://www.dhs.gov/national-cybersecurity-and-communications-integration-center)\n\n1-888-282-0870\n\n[Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team](https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/)\n\n\n-----",
