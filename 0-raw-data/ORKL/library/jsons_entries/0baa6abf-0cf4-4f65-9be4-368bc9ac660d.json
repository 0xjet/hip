APT34, Gamaredon, and Transparent Tribe are a few samples of the](https://blog.yoroi.company/research/karkoff-2020-a-new-apt34-espionage-operation-involves-lebanon-government/)\nrecently uncovered campaigns, the latter was spotted after four years of apparent inactivity.\nCybaze-Yoroi ZLab decided to study in depth a recent threat attributed to a North Korean APT\ndubbed Kimsuky.\n\nThe Kimsuky APT group has been analyzed by\n[several security teams. It was first spotted by](https://securelist.com/the-kimsuky-operation-a-north-korean-apt/57915/)\nKaspersky researcher in 2013, recently its activity\n[was detailed by ESTsecurity.](https://blog.alyac.co.kr/2737)\n\nWe decided to analysed the activity of the group\n[after noticing a tweet of the user “@spider_girl22”](https://twitter.com/spider_girl22/status/1233198285747154944)\nin February 28th 2020.\n\nFigure 1: tweet on 28 February 2020\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\n\n-----\n\nUnlike other APT groups using long and complex infection chains, the Kimsuky group leverages a\nshorter attack chain, but at the same time, we believe it is very effective in achieving a low\ndetection rate.\n\nThe infection starts with a classic executable file with “scr” extension, an extension used by\nWindows to identify Screensaver artifacts. In the following table are reported some information\nabout the sample.\n\n#### Hash 757dfeacabf4c2f771147159d26117818354af14050e6ba42c‐ c00f4a3d58e51f\n\n Threat Kimsuky loader\n\n\n#### Brief Description\n\n\n#### Scr file, initial loader\n\n\n#### Ssdeep 12288:APWcT1z2aKqkP/mANd2JiEWKZ52zfeCkIAYfLeXcj6uuLl:uhT1z 4q030JigZUaULeXc3uLl\n\nTable 1: Information about initial loader with .scr extension\n\nUpon execution, the malware writes a file named “<random_name>.tmp.db” inside the\n“%AppData%\\Local\\Temp” path through the usage of the Microsoft Utility “regsvr32.exe”.\n\nFigure 2: Written file (AutoUpdate.dll) in the “%AppData%\\Local\\Temp” path\n\nDespite the “.db” extension, the written file is actually a well formed DLL that acts as the second\nstage of the malware infection. Static information of DLL are shown below:\n\n#### Hash caa24c46089c8953b2a5465457a6c202ecfa83ab‐ bce7a9d3299ade52ec8382c2\n\n Threat Kimsuky second stage\n\n\n#### Brief Description\n\n\n#### DLL used by the Kimsuky group as second stage\n\n\n#### Ssdeep 6144:6lhe64TNUalJMRRfS5mABlakVxOfLnePfcNl6GwUDuL/:6zfeCk‐ IAYfLeXcj6uuL\n\nTable 2: AutoUpdate.dll Information\n\nThe dll is then copied into the folder “%AppData%\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Defender\\” and it\nis renamed into “AutoUpdate.dll”.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe “AutoUpdate.dll” library then gains persistence by setting the following registry key\n“HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\RunOnce\\WindowsDefender”. The name\nand the path used by the attacker is absolutely tricky, because they reference to Windows\nDefender:\n\nFigure 3: registry key set for persistence .\n\nFurthermore, exploring the content of the folder “%AppData%\\Local\\Temp” path, we observed\nanother temporary file created and immediately removed dubbed “<random_name>.tmp.bat”. By\nanalyzing its contents, we noticed that it is used to delete the initial artifact (scr) and file itself.\n\nFigure 4: Content of the bat script.\n\nIn order to hide the malicious operation and avoid raising suspicion, a legit document is created in\nthe same folder containing the “.scr” file, the document is named “이력서양식.hwp”. Translating its\nname from Korean to English language, is possible to obtain the “CV Form” string. The name and\nother information about the document are the following:\n\n#### Hash d21523b7b8f6584305a0a6a83cd65c8ce0777a42ab781c35aa06c46c91f504b4\n\n Threat Kimsuky legit document\n\n\n#### Brief De‐ scrip‐ tion\n\n Ss‐ deep\n\n\n#### Legit document used to divert attention on the malware in “hwp” extension\n\n 192:zXEKVs7kRvm+1FsO2ui/VpIkCnH5QVSV9VahhU:r3YkA+1aJuk‐ WQVS9avU\n\n\nTable 3: Information about legit document with “.hwp” extension\n\nAs implied by the file name (CV Form), the document contains a CV form with empty fields, as\nshown in the following figure.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6: Legit document overview\n\n### Bypassing AV Detection\n\nAn interesting behaviour is the “explorer.exe” injection performed by the “AutoUpdate.dll” in order\nto avoid AVs detection. Digging in the malicious code, it is possible to see the methods used to\nperform this operation. First of all, the malware sets the right privileges, as reported in the\nfollowing image.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7: Privilege set for the correct injection\n\nOnce obtained the necessary privileges, the malware is able to proceed with the injection. As\n[described by the analysis published by elastic, the malware writes the path to its malicious DLL in](https://www.elastic.co/blog/ten-process-injection-techniques-technical-survey-common-and-trending-process)\nthe virtual address space of another process through the “VirtualAllocEx” function. In this case,\nthe target process is “explorer.exe”, it ensures the remote process loads it by creating a remote\nthread inside it.\n\n\n-----\n\nTo perform these operations, first of all the malware needs to know the Process ID of the target,\nthis is performed through the navigation of all processes tree. This task can be executed using\n[the Tool Help Library Windows API family using CreateToolhelp32Snapshot(), Process32First(),](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/toolhelp/tool-help-library)\nand Process32Next() API. Then, the malware calls VirtualAllocEx() to allocate a space to write\nthe path to the malicious DLL, then it calls WriteProcessMemory() to write the DLL path inside\nthe allocated memory.\n\nAfter that, the malware calls the CreateRemoteThread() API to link the thread newly created to\nthe host process (explorer.exe). Parts of the described logic are shown in the below figure:\n\nFigure 8: API used for injection\n\nTwo components are implanted in the “explorer.exe” process. In the following tables are\npresented some information about the two DLLs extracted.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Hash bbad65136d73cbd5262bc88571677b5434ceb54fc1103f2133757‐ dae2ec4b47b\n\n Threat Injected DLL\n\n\n#### Brief Descrip‐ tion\n\n\n#### First injected DLL\n\n\n#### Ssdeep 3072:AFSYAyju5JpkC7xfYZo9cPqvTV+ql4yFa+zB+K+H/kocFAQUG5R: AFJ0qC7xAZliT004+p10fkoefUG5\n\nTable 4: Information about first DLLinjected in explorer.exe process\n\n#### Hash 817e‐ f0d9d3584977d1114b7e92012b653d339434a90967cbe8016899801f3751\n\n Threat Injected DLL\n\n\n#### Brief Descrip‐ tion\n\n\n#### Second injected DLL\n\n\n#### Ssdeep 3072:AFSYAyju5JpkC7xfYZo9cPqvTV+ql4yFa+zo+K+H/kocFAnRG5R:AF J0qC7xAZliT004+p00fkoegRG5\n\nTable 5: Information about second DLL injected in explorer.exe process\n\nComparing the ssdeep of the two DLLs is possible to notice several overlaps between the two\nlibraries, a circumstance that confirms a high “similarity” between them. Below are highlighted the\ndifferent portions of the hash:\n\n#### 3072:AFSYAyju5JpkC7xfYZo9cPqvTV+ql4yFa+z *\n\n +K+H/kocFAnRG5R:AFJ0qC7xAZliT004+p * 0fkoe * RG5\n\nThere are tiny differences between the DLLs as shown below performing a simple binary diffing\nanalysis.\n\nDue to these differences between the two DLLs, we decided to continue the analysis on one of\nthem. Digging into the DLL, we notice that every time a function has to be performed by the\nmalware, it relies on a recurrent decryption routine, which decodes the strings containing the\nactual instruction and executes it. An example of the decryption routine is reported in the following\nfigure on top right:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 10: Decryption flow graph\n\nEvery 15 minutes, the malware contacts the C2\n(suzuki.]datastore.]pe.]hu) and sends back the\ninformation about the compromised machine, as reported\nin the previous figure. In particular, three HTTP requests\nare made using different URLs paths and different UserAgent fields for each request. An example of the C2\nregistration is the following:\n\n\nFigure 11: Parts of subroutines used to\n\nperform network communication\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 12: Network traffic performed by the malware\n\n## Conclusion\n\nDuring our Threat Intelligence activities, we discovered a new malware implant compatible with\n[the previous campaigns of Kimsuky APT actor. According to the ESTsecurity firm, the initial](https://blog.alyac.co.kr/2737)\ndropper contains two malicious resources embedding the malicious DLLs, however, in our sample\nthere aren’t.\n\nDespite these little differences, we can affirm with good confidence that the Threat Actor is\nKimsuky due to strong similarities with the TTPs.\n\n## Indicator of Compromise\n\nHashes:\n\n757dfeacabf4c2f771147159d26117818354af14050e6ba42cc00f4a3d58e51f\ncaa24c46089c8953b2a5465457a6c202ecfa83abbce7a9d3299ade52ec8382c2\nbbad65136d73cbd5262bc88571677b5434ceb54fc1103f2133757dae2ec4b47b\n817ef0d9d3584977d1114b7e92012b653d339434a90967cbe8016899801f3751\nC2:\n\nsuzuki.]datastore.]pe.]hu\nPersistence:\n\nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\RunOnce\\WindowsDefender\n\n\n-----\n\n### Yara Rules\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nimport \"pe\"\nrule loader {\n  meta:\n   description = \"Yara rule for the initial loader SRC\"\n   author = \"Yoroi - ZLab\"\n   last_updated = \"2020-03-02\"\n   tlp = \"white\"\n   category = \"informational\"\nstrings:\n    $a1 = \" goto Repeat1\"\n          $a2 = {84 58 43 F4 39 1B 96 32 E4 2D 63}\n          $a3 = {89 04 4D 30 7A 05 10 41 EB E8 8B}\n          $a4 = {80 A1 B2 F7 15 DE F0 7E 35 75}\n          $a5 = {9C 0E 57 4C 77 B1 0E 06 08 5E}\n  condition:\n   uint16(0) == 0x5A4D and pe.number_of_sections == 5 and 3 of ($a*) \n}\nimport \"pe\"\nrule AutoUpdate_dll {\n  meta:\n   description = \"Yara rule for the AutoUpdate_dll\"\n   author = \"Yoroi - ZLab\"\n   last_updated = \"2020-03-02\"\n   tlp = \"white\"\n   category = \"informational\"\nstrings:\n    $a1 = {48 8B 3F 48 83 78 18 10 72}\n          $a2 = {36 42 35 45 35 41 42 33 42 41 39}\n          $a3 = { DD E7 FE DA C6 F7 F9 8D 7D F9 }\n          $a4 = \"1#SNAN\"\n          $a5 = \"d$4D9L$t\"\n          $a6 = \"DllRegisterServer\"\n          $a7 = \"DllUnregisterServer\"\n  condition:\n   uint16(0) == 0x5A4D and pe.number_of_sections == 6 and (4 of ($a*)) \n}\nimport \"pe\"\nrule injectedDLL {\n  meta:\n   description = \"Yara rule for the injected DLL\"\n   author = \"Yoroi - ZLab\"\n   last_updated = \"2020-03-02\"\n   tlp = \"white\"\n   category = \"informational\"\nstrings:\n    $a1 = {41 80 3E 5E 89 45 A4 75 08 49}\n          $a2 = {60 03 50 02 30 58 68 01 00 70}\n          $a3 = {98 F7 02 00 7B 44 00 00 91 44}\n          $a4 = \"/?m=b&p1=\"\n          $a5 = \"&p2=b\"\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n          $a6 = \"/?m=a&p1=\"\n          $a7 = \"AUAVAWH\"\n  condition:\n   uint16(0) == 0x5A4D and pe.number_of_sections == 6 and (4 of ($a*)) \n}\nrule legit_DOC {\n  meta:\n   description = \"Yara rule for the Legit DOC\"\n   author = \"Yoroi - ZLab\"\n   last_updated = \"2020-03-02\"\n   tlp = \"white\"\n   category = \"informational\"\nstrings:\n    $a1 = \"HWP Document File\"\n          $a2 = \"UPcfZrc\"\n          $a3 = {D1 A9 30 1A 5D C1 16 41 15 DA DF 54}\n          $a4 = {B4 D5 31 1B F9 66 7C 56 5A 15}\n          $a5 = {30 30 F8 18 18 F8 00 00 E0 00 00 C8}\n          $a6 = {DC 66 43 0C 53 00 65 00 63 00}\n          $a7 = {05 00 48 00 77 00 70 00 53 00 75 00 6D 00 6D}\n  condition:\n   all of them \n}\n\n```\n\n-----",
