You need law to punished rapists and you also need\nmeans to enforce the law and other measurements to prevent rape. Defense in depth.\n\nAnyway, the node-ipc author will get punished by the community and by law if victims sue\nhim. Further cursing him or fighting each other here will not help anyone, just like what he\nhas done, and certainly will not solve the underlying security issue.\n\n\n-----\n\nAlways sandboxing nodejs applications suggested above could be a solution, but expecting\nevery developer to do proper sandboxing every time simply just isn't scalable. Instead, NPM\ncould do more to eliminated a large number of security issues.\n\nFor this specific one, most packages shouldn't touch the filesystem, so a static analysis of\nimporting the `fs module could prevent it. node-ipc seems only use the` `fs module to read`\nthe config before, which is questionable in itself.\n\nCopy link\n\n### mocsy commented Mar 19, 2022 •\n edited\n\nThanks [@noblehng.

The entire OSS security model\ndepends on reviews. If those don't happen the model is broken. Maybe that's where we\nneed to improve.\n\nThe easiest way is like Russ Cox suggested, don't automatically use the latest version of all\ndependencies. Then if it is not in your direct dependencies, you could expect someone else\nto test the new version in a sandbox before update this dependency, so you are not affected.\nOr less people are affected, at least. But this method probably couldn't prevent targeted\nattack like this one.\n\nThen there is the static analysis and other automatic testings way that can be done by the\npackage manager hub before publishing, like those app stores.\n\nThe best way would be to have a dedicated security team to audit updates for core/popular\npackages before publishing, but that would need the industry to fund it.\n\nCopy link\n\n### mgag commented Mar 20, 2022\n\n\n-----\n\n[@RIAEvangelist is a hero!](https://github.com/RIAEvangelist)\nCause there's no such thing as 'an ordinary people' there, in Russia.

This is not only NPM and JS problem. Probably if package\ncrosses some critical mass of usage then it should start to go through review system before\npublished in package managers. I would say that even Log4j could have used something like\nthat where this \"code safety\" organization tries to find vurneabilities or malicious pieces of\ncode before it gets to shipped to those who haven't done proper dependency locking.\n\nI understand [@RIAEvangelist point partly as well and this dependency is biggest platform he](https://github.com/RIAEvangelist)\nhad available to use to express his opinion. Creating file on desktop would have been just\nannoyance and I guess the backlash wouldn't have been as big. Deleting files was pretty\nbad if I wouldn't have done that but for really showing your dislike the easiest and a lot less\n\n\n-----\n\nharmful way would have been to just check if IP in x country and then put in log message\nand not run functions of that dependency. That would still have been annoying, but not as\ndestructive as deleting files.\n\nIt is and will be problem in OSS. The supply-chain poisoning will be a problem if there is\nsome conflict in author's interests and we all have our own opinions. Currently only way for\nyou not to be affected by them would be to not use 3rd party dependencies or lock versions\nto known and safe packages. First one would mean a lot of reinventing wheel for companies\nand slowing innovation. Second one is what developers should do and bump versions only\nafter verified. It also could slow down development a bit, but not as much.\n\nFrom Brandon's repo comments I am really disappointed in IQ of dev community.\n\nThe harassment of his employee, Swatting, etc. is not ok still. If you have proof that the\ncode change he did caused harm, then gather it and sue him.\nDistribution of this package and \"Malware\" in my eyes lies on NPM and software that\nhas it as dependency. Technically he did not push the package to you, but you pulled\nfrom package manager.\nTalking about children's hospital now suddenly not working and respirators not\nworking... Huh? Why would they use node in respirator system or in any life-critical\nsystem at all.\nThe claim about some American NGO losing all it's files seems fake to me, just to blow\nthings out of portions. For that to happen that NGO has to make so many mistakes to\nmake it possible to lose all the data in 1 go, like lack of backups and developing and\nbuilding code with no review or test process in production servers. In order for\nmalicious package to get to production servers there should be some kind of\ndevelopment process that involves test period. If either one of those is missing or\nbroken, then it is not package that is at fault, but business process first. Yes package\nshould not contain such code, but to blame repo maintainer in series of issues in\norganization where package author has no say in changing seems wrong.\nPersonal insults, calling names is something that was done in elementary school and is\nseen as sign if immaturity than intelligence. Intelligent people insult in more subtle\nways. So show you are smart and mature. I personally thought software developers\nwere supposed to be smart people, but for now some rotten apples have broken that\nillusion.\nThere were some comments about journalists and different other profession people\nbeing affected... I do not see quite how, the most likely for you to be affected is when\nyou had Unity Hub installed or doing software development. Unity Hub issue is them\nnot doing proper dependency management. I do not see how this package would have\ngotten to all those journalists computers, are they part-time JS developers?\n\nWhoever thinks the ordinary Russian citizen is innocent and should not suffer because of\ntheir leader, then think, why does ordinary Ukrainian has to suffer because of leader of some\nother country Ordinary Russian is in that case less innocent than ordinary Ukrainian\n\n\n-----\n\n[@ShikiSuen one journalist shows how people of whole nation are? He seems like one rotten](https://github.com/ShikiSuen)\napple to ruin the bunch. His name is not Ukrainian, from the looks I doubt he is part of\nUkrainian culture or should be listened as representative of whole nation. Ukrainian president\nis chosen to be the \"face\" of whole nation and I have not heard him calling for genocide.\nFrom what I have seen is that he asks for Russian troops to go back to russia to save their\nlives because Ukrainians will protect themselves in Ukraine. There is difference in protecting\nyour own country and attacking another one. In current case Russian army is the one who\nhas bombed and killed Ukrainian people, including children, while children of Russia are safe\nin Russia.\n\nCopy link\n\n### ShikiSuen commented Mar 23, 2022 •\n edited\n\n[@krisavi The massacre in the East Ukraine started years ago prior to Russian invasion.](https://github.com/krisavi)\n\nI'm not about to blame Zelensky for that since Zelensky doesn't have enough control to what\nhappened there.\n\nThe Azov Battalion is the one to blame.\n\nWhat I can hope is that the Azov Battalion gets evaporated as earlier as possible so Russian\ntroops can be pulled out ouf Ukraine earlier.\n\nThe war itself is a disaster, still.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nCopy link\n\n### majorendian commented Mar 23, 2022\n\n[@krisavi It won't affect OSS. This is strictly a JS/NPM problem. I am unsure why you people](https://github.com/krisavi)\nthink this, maybe you could elaborate.\n\nIn general, the issue is with package managers of any sort. We have traded convenience for\nsecurity.\n\nCopy link\n\n### majorendian commented Mar 23, 2022\n\nOn a side note, if this malware wasn't OSS, it would very likely be deleting files to this day.\nSo even though it is malware, because its open source, people could identify the issue\nfaster. Just image this package to be closed-source proprietary software. The damage would\nbe continuing, and we wouldn't be here discussing it.\n\nCopy link\n\n### Uzlopak commented Mar 23, 2022\n\n[@krisavi](https://github.com/krisavi)\n\nHow do you test for Russian IP in the EU or USA? Do you test your code for every region in\nthe world?\n\nCopy link\n\n### Zei33 commented Apr 12, 2022\n\nPackage managers are built on a certain level of trust. It's unethical and sets a dangerous\nprecedent in the developer community to convert your package into malware. If you want to\nmake a statement, put a big disclaimer in the README. You can send a message without\nputting everyone at risk.\n\nThis could easily go wrong and affect people outside of the targets. Not every developer\nworks for a big corporation with measures in place to deal with this kind of disaster. You\ncould easily be wiping out months of work for a little mom-and-pop business in New Zealand,\ninnocent people that don't know any better.\n\nNow every popular package developer that has a statement to make will be thinking about\nthis kind of tactic. It's the same with faker.js and unfortunately, any developer that does this\nwill be damaged goods for the rest of their career.\n\n\n-----\n\nCopy link\n\n### xsrvmy commented Apr 23, 2022\n\nOn the topic of making statements, there was an incident over two years ago as well where\npackages started displaying ads when installed, which was NPM soon declared be\ndisallowed.\n\nFor me personally though, the most unsettling thing about this attack is that node-ipc is\nactually run on personal computers by hobbiest vue users, and it might have been able to\ndelete synced OneDrive, Dropbox, etc. files.\n\nCopy link\n\n### Disquse commented Apr 23, 2022\n\nGiven how much idiotic conspiracy theorists here, Russian propaganda works well even\noutside of Russia. This is really sad for me as a Russian, that even outside of this\ninformation prison people manage to fall to the most obvious lies.\n\n[Sign up for free to join this conversation on GitHub.
