Blog](https://cybersecurity.att.com/blogs)\n\nMarch 21, 2013 | [Jaime Blasco](https://www.alienvault.com/blogs/author/jaime-blasco)\n**Summary**\n\nDuring the last few years, we have been publishing about a group of hackers who have focused on targeting DIB (Defence\nIndustrial Base) and other government organizations:\n\n- [Another Sykipot sample likely targeting US federal agencies](https://www.alienvault.com/blogs/labs-research/another-sykipot-sample-likely-targeting-us-federal-agencies)\n\n[- Are the Sykipot’s authors obsessed with next generation US drones?](https://www.alienvault.com/blogs/labs-research/are-the-sykipots-authors-obsessed-with-next-generation-us-drones)\n\n[- Sykipot variant hijacks DOD and Windows smart cards](https://www.alienvault.com/blogs/labs-research/sykipot-variant-hijacks-dod-and-windows-smart-cards)\n\n[- Sykipot is back](https://www.alienvault.com/blogs/labs-research/sykipot-is-back)\n\nSykipot are a highly skilled group of individuals who have exploited a wide range of zeroday vulnerabilities in the last few\nyears including:\n\n**CVE** **Date** **Product**\n\nCVE-2007-0671 2007-02-02 Microsoft Excel\n\nCVE-2009-3957 2010-12-01 Adobe Reader\n\nCVE-2010-0806 2010-05-04 Internet Explorer\n\nCVE-2010-2883 2010-09-08 Adobe Reader\n\nCVE-2010-3654 2010-10-28 Adobe Flash Player\n\nCVE-2011-2462 2011-12-06 Adobe Reader\n\nIn this blog post we will unveil the new vulnerabilities that this group have used using during the last 8 months and we will\npublish the new infrastructure they have used. We will expose several examples of the campaigns they have launched and\nnew versions of the Sykipot backdoor they have used to access the compromised systems. We have found evidences that\nshow they have exploited at least the following vulnerabilities during the last few months:\n\n**CVE** **Date** **Product**\n\nCVE-2012-1889 06/13/2012 MSXML/Internet Explorer\n\nCVE-2012-1723 06/12/2012 Java 7\n\nCVE-2012-4969 09/16/2012 Microsoft Internet Explorer\n\nCVE-2013-0640 02/12/2012 Adobe Acrobat Reader\n\nSeveral times the date of the exploit was a few days after the vulnerability had been disclosed and there wasn’t a patch\nreleased by the vendor.\n\n**Campaigns**\n\nIn the past most of the campaigns which we found related to the Sykipot actors were based on SpearPhishing mails with\nattachments that exploited vulnerabilities in software like Microsoft Office, Adobe Flash, Adobe PDF and some times Internet\nExplorer. During the last 8-10 months we have seen a change and the number of SpearPhishing campaigns which have\n\n\n-----\n\nincluded a link instead of an attachment and this has increased. Once the victim clicks in the link the attackers will use\nvulnerabilities in Internet Explorer, Java, etc to access the system.\n\nSome examples of the campaigns they have launched are detailed below.\n\n**gsasmartpay.org - 2012-06-20**\n\nThe last summer, we found a malicious site that the Sykipot actors set up to try and phish government employees. When the\nvictim visited the link the following page appeared:\n\nAs we can see it shows the information\npresent in [https://smartpay.gsa.gov/.](https://smartpay.gsa.gov/)\n\n“The GSA SmartPay program,\nestablished in 1998, is the largest\ncharge card program in the world\nserving more than 350 federal\nagencies, organizations, and Native\nAmerican tribal governments. In FY10,\napproximately 98.9M transactions were\nmade and $30.2B were charged using\nthe GSA SmartPay charge cards,\ncreating $325.9M in refunds.”\n\n“Eligibility for the program is determined by the GSA SmartPay Contracting Officer. Federal agencies, departments, tribal\norganizations, and approved non-federal entities can apply to obtain charge card services under the GSA SmartPay program.”\n\nIf we take a look at the malicious files we will find that it was exploiting CVE-2012-1889 in the background:\n\nDuring the exploitation it will load the\nfollowing files as well:\n\nwww[.]gsasmartpay[.]org/cardholders/login/movie[.]swf?\napple=AA969692D8CDCD959595CC859183918F83909692839BCC8D9085CD83868D808784CC919584E2E2E2E2\n\nwww[.]gsasmartpay[.]org/cardholders/login/deployJava[.]js\n\nwww[.]gsasmartpay[.]org/cardholders/login/faq[.]htm\n\nWe are not going to show how this vulnerability is exploited since we have showed it in previous blog posts, you can find a\n[good description here.](http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/cve-2012-1889-action)\n\nsearching-job.net is another domain registered by the Sykipot actors (registered by thomas7610@yahoo.com on 06-20-2012)\nthat was also serving the same exploit at that time:\n\nwww[.]searching-job[.]net/list/verification/deployJava[.]js\n\n\n-----\n\nwww[.]searching job[.]net/list/verification/faq[.]htm\n\nwww[.]searching-job[.]net/list/verification/index[.]htm\n\nwww[.]searching-job[.]net/list/verification/movie[.]swf?\napple=AA969692D8CDCD959595CC91878390818A8B8C85CF888D80CC8C8796CD848B8E878E8B9196CC868396E2E2E2E2\n\nwww[.]searching-job[.]net/account_list/verification/index[.]htm\n\nApart from gsasmartpay.org we have found several domains registered by the Sykipot actors that they have probably used to\nphish users in the last few months. Some of the most suspicious ones are detailed below:\n\n- aafbonus.com registered by janagreen2000@yahoo.com on 06-19-2012\n\n[Probably related to American Advertising Federation - http://www.aaf.org/](http://www.aaf.org/)\n\n- nceba.org registered by jimgreen200088@yahoo.com on 07-24-2012\n\nProbably related to U.S. BANKRUPTCY ADMINISTRATOR - [http://www.nceba.uscourts.gov/](http://www.nceba.uscourts.gov/)\n\n- pdi2012.org registered by alcott.churchill@yahoo.com on 08-18-2011\n\nProbably related to PDI 2012, the premier training event hosted by the American Society of Military Comptrollers\n\n- hudsoninst.com registered by alcott.churchill@yahoo.com on 11-26-2012\n\n[Probably related to the Hudson Institute - http://www.hudson.org/](http://www.hudson.org/)\n\nHudson Institute is a nonpartisan, independent policy research organization dedicated to innovative research and analysis that\npromotes global security, prosperity, and freedom.\n\n**CVE-2012-4969 - Internet Explorer**\n\nIn September last year, the Sykipot actors registered several domains to exploit a vulnerability in Internet Explorer (CVE-20124969).\n\n- resume4jobs.net registered by james.wade1@yahoo.com on 03-08-2012\n\nURL’s involved:\n\nhttp://www[.]resume4jobs[.]net/account/1024486[.]html\n\nhttp://www[.]resume4jobs[.]net/account/embed[.]htm\n\nhttp://www[.]resume4jobs[.]net/jobs[.]exe Sykipot malware that uses info[.]resume4jobs[.]net as the C&C\n\n- paypal1.dns1.us - Dynamic DNS provider\n\nURL’s involved:\n\nhttp://paypal1[.]dns1[.]us/account/1024486[.]html\n\nhttp://paypal1[.]dns1[.]us/account/embed[.]htm\n\n- pollingvoter.org registered by jimgreen200088@yahoo.com on 06-11-2012\n\nURL’s involved:\n\nhttp://www[.]pollingvoter[.]org/ne2012/vote/embed[.]htm\n\nhttp://www[.]pollingvoter[.]org/life[.]exe Sykipot malware that uses www[.]betterslife[.]com as the C&C\n\n- skyruss.net registered by joneluxara@yahoo.com on 04-17-2012\n\nURL’s involved:\n\n\n-----\n\nhttp://social[.]sns[.]skyruss[.]net/variety/index[.]html\n\nhttp://forum[.]skyruss[.]net/articles/embed[.]htm\n\n**CVE-2012-1723 - Java 7**\n\nIn August, they were exploiting a vulnerability in Java (CVE-2012-1723) to gain access to the victim’s systems. It seems they\nwere using the Metasploit version of the exploit.\n\nSome examples are:\n\n- slashdoc.org registered by jessantt@gmail.com on 05-21-2012\n\nURL’s involved:\n\nhttp://www[.]slashdoc[.]org/default[.]jar\n\nhttp://www[.]slashdoc[.]org/index[.]html\n\nThe index.html page loads the malicious Java applet and it passes the payload they want to execute using the data parameter\n(the value is hex encoded):\n\nIn this case the host\nwww[.]photosmagnum[.]com was used\nas the C&C server.\n\n                                           - nceba.org registered by\njimgreen200088@yahoo.com on 0724-2012\n\nURL’s involved:\n\nhttp://www[.]nceba[.]org/newsroom/article/news201207240251[.]html\n\nhttp://www[.]nceba[.]org/newsroom/article/default[.]jar\n\nUsing www[.]betterslife[.]com as the C&C server.\n\n- milstars.org registered by slyan8024@gmail.com on 06-20-2012\n\nURL’s involved:\n\nhttp://milstars[.]org/view/default[.]jar\n\n**CVE-2013-0640 - PDF Exploit targeting Japanese victims**\n\nWe found the Sykipot actors using the latest Adobe Acrobat exploit (CVE-2013-0640) a few weeks ago.\n\nThe version of the exploit is the same that we found in our latest blog post:\n\n- [Latest Adobe PDF exploit used to target Uyghur and Tibetan activists](https://www.alienvault.com/open-threat-exchange/blog/latest-adobe-pdf-exploit-used-to-target-uyghur-and-tibetan-activists/)\n\nThe Javascript code inside the PDF file is very similar to the one found in the Itaduke samples but part of the initial variables\nand the obfuscation has been removed from the original one.\n\nOnce the PDF is opened the following lure file is displayed to the victim:\n\nBased on the content of the lure document the potential victims seem to be somehow related to the Japanese Ministry of\n**Health, Labour and Welfare**\n\nOnce the infection takes place the following files are created on the system:\n\nDOCUME~1ADMINI~1LOCALS~1Temppfilede.dat 5ED3A94354F27BC7AF0FEF04F89D8EB8\n\n\n-----\n\nDOCUME~1ADMINI~1LOCALS~1mpr.dll 84EFAFF343CF7A34D2A0D847A1E5FD50\n\nDOCUME~1ADMINI~1LOCALS~1setm.ini 00051F392350128BA4DD4CA10F44DDEF\n\nDOCUME~1ADMINI~1LOCALS~1 emp.dll BEA84BE4BFE236652F6A4E382B21A96F\n\nThe file setm.ini contains the configuration of Sykipot in this case:\n\n[srv_info]\n\nsleeptime=3600000\n\nurl=bassball[.]peocity[.]com (C&C server)\n\nscexe=rsvp.exe\n\nscdll=mpr.dll\n\nrunexe=run.exe\n\nmark=0304adbh\n\nThe following actions take place in the system:\n\ncmd /c reg add HKCUSOFTWAREMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionRun /v start /t REG_SZ /d [sykipot_payload_file].exe startup /f (persistence)\n\n\n-----\n\nSeveral functions are called within the Sykipot s DLL:\n\n[sykipot_payload_file].exe -startupEx\n\n[sykipot_payload_file].exe -startup1\n\ncmd /c [sykipot_payload_file].exe -startup\n\nThen the malicious payload will be injected into Internet Explorer.\n\nThe malware will communicate with the C&C server once in a while using SSL and the well known communication paths of\nprevious Sykipot payloads:\n\n/kys_allow_put.asp?type=\n\n/kys_allow_get.asp?name=\n\nAs we showed in the past most of the Sykipot samples used the key “19990817” for encryption.In this sample we have found\na new key “20120709” that is also a date.\n\n**Infrastructure**\n\nAlong with the blog post we are making a list of new domains public that weren’t mentioned in previous Sykipot research:\n\nUnique malicious domains:\n\npeocity.com\nrusview.net\nskyruss.net\ncommanal.net\nnatareport.com\nphotogellrey.com\nphotogalaxyzone.com\ninsdet.com\ncreditrept.com\npollingvoter.org\ndfasonline.com\nhudsoninst.com\nwsurveymaster.com\nnhrasurvey.org\npdi2012.org\nnceba.org\nlinkedin-blog.com\naafbonus.com\nmilstars.org\nvatdex.com\ninsightpublicaffairs.org\napplesea.net\nappledmg.net\nappleintouch.net\nseyuieyahooapis.com\nappledns.net\nemailserverctr.com\ndailynewsjustin.com\nhi-tecsolutions.org\nslashdoc.org\nphotosmagnum.com\nresume4jobs.net\nsearching-job.net\nservagency.com\n\n\n-----\n\ngsasmartpay.org\ntech-att.com\n\n[We are releasing Snort rules to detect queries to the malicious domains in your network:](https://github.com/jaimeblasco/AlienvaultLabs/tree/master/malware_analysis/Sykipot)\n\nThanks to EmergingThreats\nhttp://www.emergingthreats.net/ [no\nlonger available] for the help.
