In addition to the inherent time pressure of its\nmarketplace, a feature on the site that appeals to phishers is the mail relay function. In the\nservice of safety and anonymity, Craigslist lets people seeking or offering things send an\nemail through the system to anyone else. What the recipient sees for a sender’s address is\n<a long hex string>@<subdomain>.craigslist.org. Craigslist knows the identities of everyone,\nbut unless a correspondent discloses details, they are perfectly anonymous to others on the\nsystem.\n\nThis situation suits phishers just fine. They can shoot their poisoned arrows from behind a\nlocal mail proxy. And shoot they did — a number of times in early October.\n\n### Quick Takes: Attack Flow Overview\n\n\n-----\n\nType: phishing\nVector: fakes notifications sent from Craigslist\nPayload: malware hosted on abused OneDrive page\nTechniques: brand impersonation, abuse of the legitimate website\nPlatform: Gsuite and Office365\nTarget: Gsuite & Microsoft users\n\n### The Attack\n\nIn early October, several INKY users received real Craigslist email notifications informing\nthem that a published ad of theirs included “inappropriate content” and violated Craigslist’s\nterms and conditions. The notifications gave false instructions on how to avoid having their\naccounts deleted.\n\nIn our analysis, we learned that a common thread among recipients of this particular phish\nwas the fact that they were active Craigslist users. The notifications were “real” in the sense\nthat they really did come from a Craigslist domain, but they were fake in the sense that\nCraigslist itself, either its humans or its machines, did not intend to send them. Without\nverification from Craigslist, we can't be sure, but it appears as if Craigslist was compromised\nsince the recipients were not random (they posted ads on the platform) and the emails\noriginated from Craigslist.\n\nA sample email looked like this:\n\n_That_\n\n_big purple button looks pretty tempting._\n\n\n-----\n\nHowever, if a recipient tried to rectify this supposed problem by clicking on the big purple\nbutton, they were taken to a customized document uploaded to Microsoft OneDrive. It\nappears as if bad actors were able to manipulate the email’s HTML to create that button and\nlink it to OneDrive. Recipients were then instructed to use the “Download” link on OneDrive\nto fill out the form and return it to violations@craiglist.org.\n\nHovering over the link revealed a Russian domain (myjino[.]ru).\n\n_Victims who clicked saw “The online version is not available at the moment” and were asked_\n_to download the form_\n\nClicking on the link automatically downloaded a zip file named “form_148400455210012021.zip.”\n\nUncompressing the file revealed a macro-enabled spreadsheet named “form_148400455210012021.xls,” a document that had already been flagged by security vendors.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Not a good spreadsheet_\n\nThe spreadsheet impersonated DocuSign and also used Norton and Microsoft logos to imply\nthat the file was safe. DocuSign does not in fact have a service called “DocuSign Protect\n[Service.\" The company itself observed this particular misuse of its brand in a posting on the](https://www.docusign.com/trust/alerts/alert-new-phishing-campaign-observed-0)\nalerts section of its website from November 2020. It does have a service named “DocuSign\nProtect and Sign.”\n\n\n-----\n\n_Not DocuSign, nor Norton, much less Microsoft_\n\nUsers who clicked on “Enable Editing” and “Enable Content” bypassed Microsoft Office\nsecurity controls and allowed the macros to be executed.\n\nWe confirmed malicious activity in a malware sandbox. Files were created and modified. The\nmalware also attempted to make external connections to download more components or\nexfiltrate data, but these attempts received a “404 not found” error.\n\n\n-----\n\n_View_\n\n_from the sandbox_\n\nThe error was likely due to a mistake on the part of the bad actors, or it's possible that the\nmalicious content was discovered on those hosts and had already been taken down.\n\nIf this attack had been successful, some of the possible outcomes could have been:\n\nThe installation of a remote access tool;\nA full-blown ransomware attack;\n[The launching of Emotet to compromise an email account and use it to spam other](https://www.malwarebytes.com/emotet)\nrecipients;\nThe exfiltration of saved login credentials from a browser; or\n[The installation of a keylogger.](https://securelist.com/keyloggers-how-they-work-and-how-to-detect-them-part-1/36138/)\n\n### Techniques\n\nSent from an authentic Craigslist IP address (208.82.237.105), these attacks looked like real\nCraigslist email notifications, which, because they appeared to be legitimate, were able to\npass standard email authentication (SPF, DKIM, and DMARC).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Header analysis showing legit sender_\n\nIn this case, the recipient (the potential victim) had indeed posted a help-wanted listing,\nseeking a housekeeper in Moscow.\n\n_Indication of original Craigslist posting_\n\nThe phishers were able to manipulate the Craigslist email system to send a fake violation\nnotification to that individual. Since the URL to resolve the issue hosted a customized\ndocument placed on Microsoft OneDrive, it did not appear on any threat intelligence feed,\nallowing it to slip past most security vendors.\n\n### Recap of Techniques:\n\nBrand impersonation — a macro-enabled spreadsheet festooned with logos of\nDocuSign, Microsoft, and Norton implies safety and trust\nAbuse of cloud and web resources — bad actors send fake violation emails from\nCraigslist and lead victims to a legitimate but abused Microsoft OneDrive site that hosts\na customized document with a malware download link\nMalware — macro-enabled spreadsheet manipulates files, attempts to download more\nmalware from an external source to infect the victim’s machine\n\n### Best Practices: Guidance and Recommendations\n\n\n-----\n\nRecipients should be on the lookout for unusual requests. A red flag ought to go up right\naway if a violation notice comes in that doesn’t correspond to any recipient behavior on the\nplatform in question.\n\nAnother red flag is the mixing of platforms. It doesn’t make sense to resolve a Craigslist\nissue through a document uploaded to OneDrive.\n\nRecipients should also be suspicious about the indirect way they are being asked to sign the\nform. Proper protocol would have the form attached directly to the email rather than requiring\na trip up to OneDrive and an additional link-click there.\n\n_Fresh Phish examples were discovered and analyzed initially by Bukar Alibe, Data Analyst,_\n_INKY_\n\nLook for the next edition of INKY’s Fresh Phish blog coming soon.\n\n## About INKY\n\nHeadquartered in College Park, Maryland, INKY leads the industry in mail protection\npowered by unique computer vision, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.
