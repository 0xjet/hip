GandCrab has some interesting features not seen\nbefore in a ransomware, such as being the first to accept the DASH currency and the first to\nutilize the Namecoin powered .BIT tld.\n\n[First discovered by security researcher David Montenegro, researchers quickly jumped in to](https://twitter.com/CryptoInsane)\nanalyze the ransomware and post their results on Twitter. This article will dive into what has\nbeen discovered by myself and other researchers.\n\nUnfortunately, at this time there is no way to decrypt files encrypted by GandCrab for free.\nThis ransomware is being researched, though, and if any new information is released we will\nbe sure to update this article.\n\nFor now, if you wish to discuss GandCrab you can this article's comments section or our\n[dedicated GandCrab Help & Support Topic.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/t/669484/gandcrab-ransomware-help-support-topic-gdcb-gdcb-decrypttxt/)\n\n\n-----\n\n## GandCrab being distributed through the Rig exploit kit\n\n[According to exploit kit researchers nao_sec and Brad](https://twitter.com/nao_sec) [Duncan, GandCrab is currently being](https://twitter.com/malware_traffic)\ndistributed through a malvertising campaign called Seamless that then pushes the visitors to\nthe RIG exploit kit. The exploit kit will then attempt to utilize vulnerabilities in the visitor's\nsoftware to install GandCrab without their permission.\n\n[Hi @anyrun_app, you're agile! I found](https://twitter.com/anyrun_app?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [#GandCrab, from](https://twitter.com/hashtag/GandCrab?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [#Seamless campaign (only gate4)🤔](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Seamless?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n[https://t.co/bt0GgJsfbF](https://t.co/bt0GgJsfbF)\nCC: [@VK_Intel](https://twitter.com/VK_Intel?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [@James_inthe_box](https://twitter.com/James_inthe_box?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [@malware_traffic](https://twitter.com/malware_traffic?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n— nao_sec (@nao_sec) [January 26, 2018](https://twitter.com/nao_sec/status/956819846699696128?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nIf the exploit kit is able to install the ransomware, the victim will probably not realize they are\ninfected until it is too late.\n\n## GandCrab is the first ransomware to use the Dash Currency\n\nA first for ransomware is GandCrab's use of the DASH currency as a ransom payment. Most\nfile encrypting ransomware families have exclusively used Bitcoin as the ransom payment\nmethod. Lately, some ransomware infections have been moving to Monero and even\nEthereum.\n\n[This is the first time, though, that we have seen any ransomware ask for DASH as the](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dash_(cryptocurrency))\npayment. This is most likely due to DASH being built around privacy and thus harder for law\nenforcement to track the owners of the coins.\n\n\n-----\n\n**DASH Current as Payment**\n\nThe GandCrab developers are currently asking for 1.54 DASH, which is approximately $1,170\nUSD at today's prices.\n\n## GandCrab utilizes NameCoin's .BIT TLD\n\nAnother interesting feature is GandCrab's use of the NameCoin .BIT top-level domain. .BIT\nis not a TLD that is recognized by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers\n[(ICANN), but is instead managed by NameCoin's decentralized domain name system.](https://namecoin.org/)\n\nThis means that any software that wishes to resolve a domain name that uses the .BIT tld,\nmust use a DNS server that supports it. GandCrab does this by making dns queries using\nthe a.dnspod.com DNS server, which is accessible on the Internet and can also be used to\nresolve .bit domains.\n\nGandCrab uses these .bit domains as addresses for its Command & Control servers.\nInterestingly, the domain servers used by this ransomware contain names that you might\nrecognize.\n```\nbleepingcomputer.bit\nnomoreransom.bit\nesetnod32.bit\nemsisoft.bit\ngandcrab.bit\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n[After the publication of this story, the NameCoin developers issued a statement explaining](https://www.namecoin.org/2018/01/30/recent-reports-ransomware-using-namecoin-missing-real-story.html)\nthat even though the GandCrab devs tried to use NameCoin DNS for their command &\ncontrol servers, they did not set it up correctly. Instead the NameCoin developers stated\nthat dnspod.com was just allowing the use of .bit domains even though it is not a TLD\nrecognized by ICANN.\n\n## How GandCrab encrypts a computer\n\nWhen GandCrab is first launched it. will attempt to connect to the ransomware's Command\n& Control server. As this server is hosted on one of Namecoin's .bit domains, it has to query a\nname server that supports this TLD.\n\nIt does this by querying for the addresses of the following domains using the command\n**nslookup [insert domain] a.dnspod.com. This command queries the a.dnspod.com**\nname server, which support the .bit TLD, for one of the domains below.\n```\nbleepingcomputer.bit\nnomoreransom.bit\nesetnod32.bit\nemsisoft.bit\ngandcrab.bit\n\n```\nIf the victim's machine is unable to connect to the C2 server, then the ransomware will not\nencrypt the computer. It will, though, continue running in the background trying to get the IP\naddress for the C2 and connect to it.\n\nOnce it is able to resolve the domain, it will connect to the C2 server's IP address. It is not\nknown at this time what data is being sent and retrieved, but the C2 is most likely sending the\npublic key that should be used to encrypt the files.\n\nDuring this process, the ransomware will also connect\nto http://ipv4bot.whatismyipaddress.com/ to determine the public IP address of the victim.\n\nBefore GandCrab encrypts the victim's files it will first check for certain processes and\nterminate them. This will close any file handles that are open by these processes so that they\n[can be properly encrypted. According to security researcher Vitali Kremez, the list of](https://twitter.com/VK_Intel)\nprocesses that are terminated are:\n```\nmsftesql.exe, sqlagent.exe, sqlbrowser.exe, sqlservr.exe, sqlwriter.exe, oracle.exe,\nocssd.exe, dbsnmp.exe, synctime.exe, mydesktopqos.exe, agntsvc.exeisqlplussvc.exe,\nxfssvccon.exe, mydesktopservice.exe, ocautoupds.exe, agntsvc.exeagntsvc.exe,\nagntsvc.exeencsvc.exe, firefoxconfig.exe, tbirdconfig.exe, ocomm.exe, mysqld.exe,\nmysqld-nt.exe, mysqld-opt.exe, dbeng50.exe, sqbcoreservice.exe, excel.exe,\ninfopath.exe, msaccess.exe, mspub.exe, onenote.exe, outlook.exe, powerpnt.exe,\nsteam.exe, thebat.exe, thebat64.exe, thunderbird.exe, visio.exe, winword.exe,\nwordpad.exe\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nGandCrab will now begin to encrypt the victim s files and will target only certain file\n[extensions. According to researcher Pepper Potts, the list of extensions are:](https://twitter.com/P3pperP0tts)\n```\n1cd, .3dm, .3ds, .3fr, .3g2, .3gp, .3pr, .7z, .7zip, .aac, .ab4, .abd, .acc, .accdb,\n.accde, .accdr, .accdt, .ach, .acr, .act, .adb, .adp, .ads, .agdl, .ai, .aiff, .ait,\n.al, .aoi, .apj, .apk, .arw, .ascx, .asf, .asm, .asp, .aspx, .asset, .asx, .atb,\n.avi, .awg, .back, .backup, .backupdb, .bak, .bank, .bay, .bdb, .bgt, .bik, .bin,\n.bkp, .blend, .bmp, .bpw, .bsa, .c, .cash, .cdb, .cdf, .cdr, .cdr3, .cdr4, .cdr5,\n.cdr6, .cdrw, .cdx, .ce1, .ce2, .cer, .cfg, .cfn, .cgm, .cib, .class, .cls, .cmt,\n.config, .contact, .cpi, .cpp, .cr2, .craw, .crt, .crw, .cry, .cs, .csh, .csl, .css,\n.csv, .d3dbsp, .dac, .das, .dat, .db, .db_journal, .db3, .dbf, .dbx, .dc2, .dcr,\n.dcs, .ddd, .ddoc, .ddrw, .dds, .def, .der, .des, .design, .dgc, .dgn, .dit, .djvu,\n.dng, .doc, .docm, .docx, .dot, .dotm, .dotx, .drf, .drw, .dtd, .dwg, .dxb, .dxf,\n.dxg, .edb, .eml, .eps, .erbsql, .erf, .exf, .fdb, .ffd, .fff, .fh, .fhd, .fla,\n.flac, .flb, .flf, .flv, .flvv, .forge, .fpx, .fxg, .gbr, .gho, .gif, .gray, .grey,\n.groups, .gry, .h, .hbk, .hdd, .hpp, .html, .ibank, .ibd, .ibz, .idx, .iif, .iiq,\n.incpas, .indd, .info, .info_, .ini, .iwi, .jar, .java, .jnt, .jpe, .jpeg, .jpg, .js,\n.json, .k2p, .kc2, .kdbx, .kdc, .key, .kpdx, .kwm, .laccdb, .lbf, .lck, .ldf, .lit,\n.litemod, .litesql, .lock, .log, .ltx, .lua, .m, .m2ts, .m3u, .m4a, .m4p, .m4v, .ma,\n.mab, .mapimail, .max, .mbx, .md, .mdb, .mdc, .mdf, .mef, .mfw, .mid, .mkv, .mlb,\n.mmw, .mny, .money, .moneywell, .mos, .mov, .mp3, .mp4, .mpeg, .mpg, .mrw, .msf,\n.msg, .myd, .nd, .ndd, .ndf, .nef, .nk2, .nop, .nrw, .ns2, .ns3, .ns4, .nsd, .nsf,\n.nsg, .nsh, .nvram, .nwb, .nx2, .nxl, .nyf, .oab, .obj, .odb, .odc, .odf, .odg, .odm,\n.odp, .ods, .odt, .ogg, .oil, .omg, .one, .orf, .ost, .otg, .oth, .otp, .ots, .ott,\n.p12, .p7b, .p7c, .pab, .pages, .pas, .pat, .pbf, .pcd, .pct, .pdb, .pdd, .pdf, .pef,\n.pem, .pfx, .php, .pif, .pl, .plc, .plus_muhd, .pm!, .pm, .pmi, .pmj, .pml, .pmm,\n.pmo, .pmr, .pnc, .pnd, .png, .pnx, .pot, .potm, .potx, .ppam, .pps, .ppsm,\n.ppsx,.ppt, .pptm, .pptx, .prf, .private, .ps, .psafe3, .psd, .pspimage, .pst, .ptx,\n.pub, .pwm, .py, .qba, .qbb, .qbm, .qbr, .qbw, .qbx, .qby, .qcow, .qcow2, .qed, .qtb,\n.r3d, .raf, .rar, .rat, .raw, .rdb, .re4, .rm, .rtf, .rvt, .rw2, .rwl, .rwz, .s3db,\n.safe, .sas7bdat, .sav, .save, .say, .sd0, .sda, .sdb, .sdf, .sh, .sldm, .sldx, .slm,\n.sql, .sqlite, .sqlite3, .sqlitedb, .sqlite-shm, .sqlite-wal, .sr2, .srb, .srf, .srs,\n.srt, .srw, .st4, .st5, .st6, .st7, .st8, .stc, .std, .sti, .stl, .stm, .stw, .stx,\n.svg, .swf, .sxc, .sxd, .sxg, .sxi, .sxm, .sxw, .tax, .tbb, .tbk, .tbn, .tex, .tga,\n.thm, .tif, .tiff, .tlg, .tlx, .txt, .upk, .usr, .vbox, .vdi, .vhd, .vhdx, .vmdk,\n.vmsd, .vmx, .vmxf, .vob, .vpd, .vsd, .wab, .wad, .wallet, .war, .wav, .wb2, .wma,\n.wmf, .wmv, .wpd, .wps, .x11, .x3f, .xis, .xla, .xlam, .xlk, .xlm, .xlr, .xls, .xlsb,\n.xlsm, .xlsx, .xlt, .xltm, .xltx, .xlw, .xml, .xps, .xxx, .ycbcra, .yuv, .zip\n\n```\nWhile encrypting files, Kremez's analysis showed that GandCrab will skip any files whose full\npathname contain the following strings:\n```\n\\ProgramData\\, \\Program Files\\, \\Tor Browser\\, Ransomware, \\All Users\\, \\Local\nSettings\\, desktop.ini, autorun.inf, ntuser.dat, iconcache.db, bootsect.bak,\nboot.ini, ntuser.dat.log, thumbs.db, GDCB-DECRYPT.txt, .sql\n\n```\nWhen encrypting files, the ransomware will append the .GDCB extension to the encrypted\nfile's name. For example, test.jpg would be encrypted and renamed to test.jpg.GDCB.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Encrypted GDCB Files**\n\nAt some point, the ransomware will relaunch itself using the command\n\"C:\\Windows\\system32\\wbem\\wmic.exe\" process call create \"cmd /c start\n**%Temp%\\[launched_file_name].exe\". If a user does not respond Yes to the below**\nprompt, it will continuously display the UAC prompt.\n\n**UAC Prompt**\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen the ransomware has finished encrypting the computer, victim s will find ransom notes\nlocated through the computer. This ransom note is named GDCB-DECRYPT.txt and\ncontains information on what happened to the victim's files and a list of TOR gateways that\ncan be used to access the payment site.\n\n**GandCrab GDCB-DECRYPT.txt Ransom Note**\n\nWhen a user goes to the listed site, they will be presented with a site called\nGandCrab Decryptor. This site provides information such as the ransom amount, the DASH\naddress to send payment to, a support chat, and a free decryption of one file.\n\n\n-----\n\n**GandCrab Decryptor**\n\nAs already stated, unfortunately there is no way to decrypt the files for free at this time. If you\nneed help or would like to discuss this ransomware, you can do so in our dedicated\n[GandCrab Help & Support Topic.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/t/669484/gandcrab-ransomware-help-support-topic-gdcb-gdcb-decrypttxt/)\n\n## How to protect yourself from the GandCrab Ransomware\n\nIn order to protect yourself from ransomware, it is important that you use good computing\nhabits and security software. First and foremost, you should always have a reliable and tested\nbackup of your data that can be restored in the case of an emergency, such as a ransomware\nattack. With a good backup, ransomware has no effect on you.\n\nYou should also have security software that incorporates behavioral detections to combat\nransomware and not just signature detections or heuristics. For example, Emsisoft Anti[Malware and Malwarebytes Anti-Malware both contain behavioral detection that can prevent](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/malwarebytes-anti-malware/)\nmany, if not most, ransomware infections from encrypting a computer.\n\n\n-----\n\nLast, but not least, make sure you practice the following security habits, which in many cases\nare the most important steps of all:\n\nBackup, Backup, Backup!\nDo not open attachments if you do not know who sent them.\nDo not open attachments until you confirm that the person actually sent you them,\n[Scan attachments with tools like VirusTotal.](https://www.virustotal.com/#/home/upload)\nMake sure all Windows updates are installed as soon as they come out! Also make sure\nyou update all programs, especially Java, Flash, and Adobe Reader. Older programs\ncontain security vulnerabilities that are commonly exploited by malware distributors\nand exploit kits. Therefore it is important to keep them updated.\nMake sure you use have some sort of security software installed that uses behavioral\ndetections or white list technology. White listing can be a pain to train, but if your\nwilling to stock with it, could have the biggest payoffs.\nUse hard passwords and never reuse the same password at multiple sites.\n\nFor a complete guide on ransomware protection, you visit our How to Protect and Harden a\nComputer against Ransomware article.\n\n**Update 2/8/18 10:46 AM: Updated articles to include information from the NameCoin**\ndevelopers regarding how the GandCrab devs did not properly configure the C2 domains\nusing NameCoin.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[New ‘Cheers’ Linux ransomware targets VMware ESXi servers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-cheers-linux-ransomware-targets-vmware-esxi-servers/)\n\n[SpiceJet airline passengers stranded after ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/spicejet-airline-passengers-stranded-after-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[US Senate: Govt’s ransomware fight hindered by limited reporting](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-senate-govt-s-ransomware-fight-hindered-by-limited-reporting/)\n\n[New RansomHouse group sets up extortion market, adds first victims](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-ransomhouse-group-sets-up-extortion-market-adds-first-victims/)\n\n[Ransomware attack exposes data of 500,000 Chicago students](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-attack-exposes-data-of-500-000-chicago-students/)\n\n## IOCs\n\n### GandCrab Hashes:\n```\naedf80c426fb649bb258e430a3830d85\n6866d8d8bf8565d94e0e1479978cf1e5\n379e149517f4119f2edb9676ec456ed4\n\n## GandCrab Network Communication:\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n92.53.66.11/curl.php?token \nipv4bot.whatismyipaddress.com\nhttp://gdcbghvjyqy7jclk.onion\nhttp://gdcbghvjyqy7jclk.onion.top/         \nhttp://gdcbghvjyqy7jclk.onion.casa/         \nhttp://gdcbghvjyqy7jclk.onion.guide/          \nhttp://gdcbghvjyqy7jclk.onion.rip/                         \nhttp://gdcbghvjyqy7jclk.onion.plus/                \n\n## GandCrab Files:\nGDCB-DECRYPT.txt\n\n GandCrab Ransom Note:\n---= GANDCRAB =--Attention!\nAll your files documents, photos, databases and other important files are encrypted\nand have the extension: .GDCB \nThe only method of recovering files is to purchase a private key.
