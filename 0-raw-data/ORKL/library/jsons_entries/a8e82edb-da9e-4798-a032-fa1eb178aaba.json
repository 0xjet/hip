    "plain_text": "# SolarWinds CEO apologizes for blaming an intern, says attack may have started in January 2019\n\n**[therecord.media/solarwinds-ceo-apologizes-for-blaming-an-intern-says-attack-may-have-started-in-january-2019/](https://therecord.media/solarwinds-ceo-apologizes-for-blaming-an-intern-says-attack-may-have-started-in-january-2019/)**\n\nMay 19, 2021\n\nCorporate keynotes at the annual RSA Conference are generally uneventful PR\nopportunities for executives and vendors. But the chief executive of SolarWinds on\nWednesday gave a candid assessment of the company’s supply chain compromise,\napologizing for the way the company initially blamed the incident on an intern and providing\nnew details about the timing of the attack.\n\nSudhakar Ramakrishna, the former CEO of Pulse Secure who took the top job at SolarWinds\nin January 2021, also said he was advised by friends and colleagues to “back out” of the\ncompany and find another job when it became clear around the time of his hiring that a\nsupply chain attack targeting the company’s Orion software had potentially infected\nthousands of organizations, including several government agencies.\n\nRamakrishna recounted an early conversation he had with William Bock, who sits on the\ncompany’s board of directors, about his decision to stay on. “I felt that continuity and urgency\nwas important in this situation. Having a new CEO come in… could be time consuming,” he\n\n\n-----\n\nsaid. I felt the right decision was to continue on as CEO given the needs of the company\nand customers.”\n\nSimilarly, when asked about Tim Brown, the company’s CISO since 2017, Ramakrishna said\nhe wasn’t interested in making a scapegoat out of the security team. “I do not like to flog\nfailures… While I acknowledge and accept that if you want to be an ‘action-oriented CEO,’\nyou fire a bunch of people, but I don’t think that does justice,” he said.\n\n“Just as CEOs get a lot of credit when things go well… I think CISOs get undo discredit\n\n[when things go poorly], and I felt I should not be doing the norm or what is stereotypical in\nthese situations, and went about my own way,” he added.\n\nCISOs, CEOs, CIOs and other top executives at Target, Equifax, Uber, Capital One and\nseveral other companies have either resigned or been fired following security breaches in\n[recent years. A common joke in the cybersecurity industry is that a CISO’s job is to be fired](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/yes-cisos-should-expect-get-fired-simon-legg/)\nafter such incidents.\n\nSolarWinds CEO Sudhakar Ramakrishna at a February Congressional hearing.\nRamakrishna also apologized for the way the company blamed an intern for using a weak\npassword—solarwinds123—during early testimony before congress. When asked about the\npassword by Rep. Rashida Tlaib during a joint hearing by the House Oversight and\nHomeland Security committees, former SolarWinds CEO Kevin Thompson said the\n[password was “a mistake that an intern made.” Ramakrishna also told lawmakers that the](https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/26/politics/solarwinds123-password-intern/index.html)\npassword was from an intern’s Github account.\n\n“What happened at the congressional hearing where we attributed this to an intern was not\nappropriate and is not what we’re about,” Ramakrishna said during his RSA talk. “You want\nyour employees, including interns, to make mistakes and learn from those mistakes and get\nbetter.”\n\n\n-----\n\nOn the topic of the breach itself, Ramakrishna also gave additional details about the timeline\nof the attack. The group behind the compromise, which the U.S. government has attributed\nto Russia’s foreign intelligence service, “may have been in our environment as early as jan\n2019… doing very early recon activities,” Ramakrishna said. The company has said that it\nbelieved hackers initially accessed SolarWinds’ systems as early as September 2019.\n\nTags\n\n[RSA](https://therecord.media/tag/rsa/)\n[SolarWinds](https://therecord.media/tag/solarwinds/)\n[supply chain attack](https://therecord.media/tag/supply-chain-attack/)\n[SVR](https://therecord.media/tag/svr/)\n\nAdam is the founding editor-in-chief of The Record by Recorded Future.
