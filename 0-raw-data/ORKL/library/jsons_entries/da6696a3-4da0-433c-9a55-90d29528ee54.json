Our most recent research takes two email addresses evoking the\nname of one of the most prominent bulletproof hosting providers on earth and ties them to\nnewly discovered batches of Magecart infrastructure. From there, we show how this\ninfrastructure overlaps with previously reported Magecart activity and highlight some\ncommon Magecart operator practices that can help researchers identify skimming\ninfrastructure.\n\n**Media Land is King**\n\nMeda Land LLC is a bulletproof hosting company that's become a powerhouse in the\ncybercriminal underworld. The service is run by Ukrainian Alexander Alexandrovich\n[Volosovik (aka Yalishanda), who in July 2019, Brian Krebs named one of the most prolific](https://krebsonsecurity.com/tag/media-land-llc/)\nbulletproof hosters in the world.\n\nVolosovik, who touts his company on cybercrime forums, advertises its ability to host all\nmanner of illicit sites and infrastructure. RiskIQ analysis shows that Media Land is also a\ndriving force in the Magecart ecosystem. Magecart groups use Media Land-registered\ndomains to carry out a massive amount of skimming and phishing attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\nMedia Land appears to be so ubiquitous that it rears its head in Magecart infrastructure even\nwhen it's not directly hosting a skimming domain, possibly used to bolster credibility among\ncybercriminals.\n\nOur researchers have tied together significant swaths of Magecart infrastructure linked to the\n[name 'Julio Jaime.' The name was first publicly documented by a Sucuri report from August](https://blog.sucuri.net/2019/08/skimmers-and-phishing.html)\nof 2019, which noted Julio Jaime's use of 'Media Lend, LLC,' a name evoking the infamous\nservice provider as the registrant organization on some WHOIS records. RiskIQ connects\n[Media Lend, LLC to 180 malicious domains.](https://community.riskiq.com/search/whois/organization/Media%20Lend,%20LLC)\n\nJulio Jaimes owns two email addresses that also include 'Media Land.' Together,\n[medialand.regru@gmail[.]com and](https://community.riskiq.com/search/whois/email/medialand.regru@gmail.com) [medialand.webnic@gmail[.]com have been used to](https://community.riskiq.com/search/whois/email/medialand.webnic@gmail.com)\nregister thousands of domains created for skimming and phishing. RiskIQ has tied the latter,\n[medialand.webnic@gmail.com, to at least 98 domains, including several Magecart skimming](https://community.riskiq.com/search/whois/email/medialand.webnic@gmail.com)\ndomains.\n\nThe former, [medialand.regru@gmail[.]com, appears to be unknown to the threat intelligence](https://community.riskiq.com/search/whois/email/medialand.regru@gmail.com)\ncommunity until now. We used our [Internet Intelligence Graph to connect the Magecart](https://www.riskiq.com/blog/external-threat-management/internet-intelligence-graph/)\ndomains registered by these emails to several skimmers. Since December of 2018, RiskIQ\nhas observed this email address used to register over 1,000 domains intended or actively\nused for skimming, phishing, and other malicious activities.\n\n**What's in a Name?**\n\n[RiskIQ's Internet Intelligence Graph connects 'Julio Jaime' to more than 240 domains, most](https://community.riskiq.com/search/whois/name/Julio%20Jaime)\nof which they developed for phishing attacks targeting end-users of financial institutions,\nsuch as the Bank of Ireland, and users of various services, such as Microsoft O365. These\nalso include domains RiskIQ has flagged for hosting Magecart card skimmers. You can see\ntwo examples, [cdnpack[.]net and](https://community.riskiq.com/search/cdnpack.net) [gstaticapi[.]com in RiskIQ Community.](https://community.riskiq.com/search/gstaticapi.com)\n\nJulio Jaime also links to Magecart activity previously reported by RiskIQ. One of the domains\n[tied to the email address medialand.webnic@gmail.com includes jquerycloud[.]com. Our](https://community.riskiq.com/search/whois/email/medialand.webnic@gmail.com)\n[December analysis of the Meyhod skimmer shows that our systems observed it on](https://community.riskiq.com/article/14924d61)\njquerycloud[.]com.\n\nThe domain jquerycloud[.]com was hosted on the same IP address as another domain,\n[statexplore[.]com. On November 27, 2020, the WHOIS record for statexplore[.]com changed](https://community.riskiq.com/search/statexplore.com)\n[to use the email address medialand.webnic@gmail.com with the name Mihael Smith (an](https://community.riskiq.com/search/whois/email/medialand.webnic@gmail.com)\n[apparent misspelling of Michael) in lieu of 'Julio Jaime.' In our Inter Skimmer Kit post from](https://community.riskiq.com/article/30f22a00)\nSeptember 2020, we noted similar use of random names for registrations, which is common\namong Magecart operators. However, in RiskIQ data, this misspelled name only associates\nwith the two ‘Media Land’ email address covered in this report.\n\n**More Magecart Ties**\n\n\n-----\n\nIn [our November analysis on new variants of the Grelos skimmer, we highlighted the domain](https://community.riskiq.com/article/8c4b4a7a)\n[facebookapimanager[.]com and connected it to several other Magecart domains with a](https://community.riskiq.com/search/facebookapimanager.com)\ndistinct cookie. Via the cookie, we connected facebookapimanager[.]com to another domain,\n[googleapimanager[.]com, which was registered by medialand.regru@gmail[.]com, the email](https://community.riskiq.com/search/googleapimanager.com/whois)\naddress belonging to the threat actor behind 'Julio Jaime' and 'Mihael Smith.’\n\nVisualization of Magecart infrastructure connectivity\n\n[Googleapimanager[.]com was also linked to RacoonStealer info stealer via a shared IP](https://www.cyberark.com/resources/threat-research-blog/raccoon-the-story-of-a-typical-infostealer)\n[address, which RiskIQ systems saw dropped from 217.8.117[.]89/theCCnew/index.php via](https://bazaar.abuse.ch/sample/31b85fde884193b976d6cae2209bd2c95f13d6de5d0ff4206612a8768a0c65d6/)\n[our Crowdstrike intelligence integration. According to Ben Cohen at CyberArk, \"Racoon is](https://www.cyberark.com/resources/threat-research-blog/raccoon-the-story-of-a-typical-infostealer)\nused to steal sensitive and confidential information including login credentials, credit card\ninformation, cryptocurrency wallets and browser information…\" and is often delivered\nthrough phishing campaigns or exploit kits.\n\n**Scale your Defense in Response**\n\nMagecart attacks have skyrocketed, with RiskIQ detecting new attacks every few minutes.\nWith more and more researchers looking into this growing threat, the massive scope of\nMagecart's cybercrime empire and its mind-boggling intricacies is finally being exposed. In\nresponse, organizations must have the intelligence necessary to scale their defense to meet\nthis growing threat and be aware of how Magecart affects its attack surface.\n\nFrom just two email addresses, RiskIQ’s Internet Intelligence Graph was able to unearth\nlarge swaths of Magecart infrastructure and connect them to other activity, a key capability in\nprotecting your organization from this top web-based threat. Be sure to check-in on RiskIQ's\nThreat Intelligence portal as we continue to track Magecart and publish the intelligence that\ncan help you defend your organization.
