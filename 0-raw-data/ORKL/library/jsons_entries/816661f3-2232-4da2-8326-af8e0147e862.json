We analyzed the Mach-O sample and found it to be a new malware family\ntargeting the Mac OS platform. We also eventually found samples compiled for the\nLinux platform that belongs to the same malware family.\n\nWe noticed that a chat application named MiMi retrieved the rshell executable, an app\n[we came across recently while investigating threat actor Earth Berberoka. We noticed](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/exposing-earth-berberoka-a-multiplatform-apt-campaign-targeting-online-gambling-sites)\nIron Tiger controlling the servers hosting the app installers of MiMi, suggesting a supply\nchain attack. Further investigation showed that MiMi chat installers have been\ncompromised to download and install HyperBro samples for the Windows platform and\nrshell samples for the Mac OS platform. While this was not the first time the technique\n[was used, this latest development shows Iron Tiger’s interest in compromising victims](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/12/10/luckymouse-ta428-compromise-able-desktop/)\nusing the three major platforms: Windows, Linux, and macOS.\n\nInfection vector\n\nMiMi (mimi = 秘密 = secret in Chinese) is an instant messaging application designed\nespecially for Chinese users, with implementations for major desktop and mobile\noperating systems: Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS. The desktop versions are\n[developed with the help of ElectronJS framework, which is a cross-platform framework](https://www.electronjs.org/)\nbased on Node.js, allowing the developers to create applications with HTML, Javascript\n(JS), and CSS.\n\n[We already came across an abuse of this application during the Earth Berberoka](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/exposing-earth-berberoka-a-multiplatform-apt-campaign-targeting-online-gambling-sites)\ninvestigation. However, compared to Earth Berberoka’s routine wherein the threat actor\nset up a fake website to deliver a malicious chat application, in this instance Iron Tiger\ncompromised the server hosting the legitimate installers for this chat application for a\n\n\n-----\n\nsupply chain attack. Contrary to the fake website, the links to the mobile versions of the\napplication for Android and iPhone worked. Also, we could not find anything malicious\nin the latest Windows installer.\n\nIn June, we were able to download the macOS installer for the 2.3.2 version of MiMi\nchat and verified it as genuine. After downloading it again later, we found that the\ninstaller was replaced with a malicious version retrieving the rshell sample. This was\nproof that the attackers had direct access to the installers‘ host server, and that they were\nmonitoring the versions published by the MiMi app developers in order to quickly insert\na backdoor.\n\nFigure 1. Downloaded installer before (left) and after (right) malware\n\nembedding\n\nIn this case, we can see that it took an hour and a half for the attackers to modify the\nlegitimate installer and add malicious code to it. For older versions, it took the attackers\none day to inject its modifications.\n\nThe modification occurs in the electron-main.js file, which contains a block of code\nbeginning with “eval(function(p,a,c,k,e,d)”, suggesting we are dealing with Dean\nEdwards packer.\n\nFigure 2. Malicious Javascript code inserted into 2.3.2.dmg targeting macOS\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3. Deobfuscated malicious Javascript code\n\nOnce deobfuscated, we saw that the inserted code downloads rshell from the IP address\n139[.]180[.]216[.]65 and executes it once run on the macOS platform. The delivered\nrshell malware is a new family we will discuss in a later section.\n\nAfter looking at previous versions of this installer, we found that the first compromised\nversion was 2.3.0, built on May 26, 2022, while the previous version (2.2.10, published\non May 6, 2022) was clean. This led is to our first assumption that Iron Tiger had access\nto the Mimi chat developer's backend between the two dates in May.\n\nHowever, a further look at our telemetry revealed older installers that have been\ncompromised, this time aimed at Windows OS. Version 2.2.0 and 2.2.1 (both built on\nNovember 23, 2021), had similar additions to the electron-main.js file.\n\nFigure 4. Malicious Javascript code inserted into 2.2.0.exe targeting Windows OS\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5. Deobfuscated malicious JavaScript code from 2.2.0.exe\n\nWe saw that one executable, one dynamic link library (DLL), and one binary file were\nbeing downloaded into the temporary directory before running the executable. This is\nthe typical way that this threat actor loads its files, exploiting DLL side-loading\nvulnerabilities in legitimate and usually signed executables. In this case, the exploited\n[executable belongs to the DESlock+ product, as described last year when we analyzed](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_no/research/21/d/iron-tiger-apt-updates-toolkit-with-evolved-sysupdate-malware-va.html)\nanother Iron Tiger campaign, using malware HyperBro.\n\nMalware analysis\n\n**rshell**\n\nThe rshell executable is a standard backdoor and implements functions typical of similar\nbackdoors:\n\n1. Collect OS information and send it to command and control (C&C) server\n2. Receive commands from the C&C server to execute\n3. Send command execution results back to the C&C\n\nWe found multiple samples of this particular backdoor, with some of them in the MachO format (macOS platform), while others were in the ELF format (Linux platform). The\noldest sample we found was uploaded in June 2021, with the first victim reported in\n\n\n-----\n\nmid-July 2021.\n\nThe OS information collection routine gathers the following information:\n\nGUID: (randomly generated guid, stored in /tmp/guid)\n[computer name: uname (nodename)](https://ss64.com/osx/uname.html)\n[IP addresses: (getifaddrs)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/getifaddrs.3.html)\nmessage type: login\n[username: _getpwuid (pw_name)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/getpwuid.3p.html)\n[version: uname (release)](https://ss64.com/osx/uname.html)\n\n[Once collected, the backdoor “packs” them into a Binary JSON (BSON) message and](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSON)\nsends it over TCP to the C&C in clear (unencrypted) form.\n\nFigure 6. Deserialized BSON packet (and displayed as JSON)\n\nwith login message containing OS information\n\nThe message received from the C&C is also in BSON format and contains the following\nfields:\n\n|Type|Subtype|Explanation|\n|---|---|---|\n|Cmd|Init|Start new shell|\n|Cmd|close|Kill shell|\n|Cmd|data|Commands to execute in shell|\n|File|Init|List root / directory|\n|File|Dir|List directory|\n|File|down|Prepare file for downloading|\n|File|read|Read file (transfer bytes)|\n|File|close|Close file|\n|File|upload|Prepare file for uploading|\n|File|write|Write file (transfer bytes)|\n\n\n-----\n\n|File|Del|Delete file|\n|---|---|---|\n\n\nTable 1. Type and subtype of packets received from\n\nthe C&C\n\nThe client also regularly sends a packet of type ‘keepalive’ to the C&C.\n\nRunning the DMG installer on a macOS machine, the user is shown several warnings\nbefore the trojanized app is installed and run. At first, Safari web browser asks the user\nto allow downloads from the given website. After choosing “Allow,” downloading, and\nexecuting the DMG installer, another warning message about an unverified developer is\ndisplayed.\n\nTo override this warning, the user must open\n“System Preferences” and “Security & Privacy”\ntabs and click on “Open Anyway.”\n\nFigure 7. Unverified developer warning\nwith the “Open” button noticeably missing\n\nFigure 8. Security & Privacy tab to allow running apps from unverified developers\n\nAfterward, one more warning about the unverified developer is displayed. This time,\nhowever, the “Open” button appears in the prompt so the application can finally start.\n\nWe confirmed that both the legitimate and the malicious versions of the chat installer\nwere unsigned, which means the users of MiMi chat were probably used to all these\nextra steps to finally install the application despite all the macOS watchguards.\n\n\n-----\n\n**HyperBro**\n\nThe HyperBro malware family has been around\n[since 2017 and has been extensively analyzed. It](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/emissary-panda-attacks-middle-east-government-sharepoint-servers/)\nwas updated in mid-2019, which we described\n[in detail in our Operation DRBControl paper.](https://documents.trendmicro.com/assets/white_papers/wp-uncovering-DRBcontrol.pdf)\n\nThe version used in this campaign is no\ndifferent from what we already described in our\n[previous Iron Tiger investigation. The only](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_no/research/21/d/iron-tiger-apt-updates-toolkit-with-evolved-sysupdate-malware-va.html)\nnoteworthy element is the Authenticode\nsignature of dlpprem32.dll, which is signed by a\n(now) revoked certificate belonging to “Cheetah\nMobile Inc.” The said company was formerly\nknown as Kingsoft Internet Software Holdings\nLimited, wherein during our previous\ninvestigation on the group, we already found\none HyperBro DLL signed by a certificate\nbelonging to Kingsoft.\n\nTargets\n\nFigure 9. Unverified developer warning\n\nWe found 13 different targets while following\n\nwith the “Open” button enabled\n\nour sensors‘ data. The only targeted countries\nwere Taiwan and the Philippines: five targets of\nHyperBro (four in Taiwan and one in the Philippines). Meanwhile, we found eight\ntargets for rshell: six in Taiwan, one in the Philippines, and one being in Taiwan and the\nPhilippines.\n\n\nWhile we were unable to identify all the targets, these targeting demographics\ndemonstrate a geographical region of interest for Iron Tiger. Among those targets, we\ncould only identify one of them: a Taiwanese gaming development company.\nInterestingly, we found a sample from the Reptile rootkit framework in that same\ncompany, as well as network requests to a subdomain that belongs to Earth Berberoka’s\ninfrastructure.\n\nWe also noticed network requests from a Taiwanese IT development company to the\nsubdomain trust[.]veryssl[.]org, and the subdomain center.veryssl[.]org is a C&C for\none of the rshell samples we found. This suggests the company could be compromised by\nthe same threat actor.\n\nTimeline\n\nJune 2021: Oldest Linux rshell sample found\nNovember 2021: Threat actor modified version 2.2.0 of Windows MiMi chat\ninstaller to download and execute HyperBro backdoor\n\n\n-----\n\nMay 2021: Threat actor modified version 2.3.0 of Mac OS MiMi chat installer to\ndownload and execute “rshell” backdoor\n\nAttribution and conclusion\n\nWe attribute this campaign to Iron Tiger for multiple reasons. First, the dlpprem32.dll\nfile linked to HyperBro shares certain characteristics (specifically imphash, RICH\nheader) with previous samples already attributed to the group. Also, the file names\ninvolved in the decoding and loading of HyperBro are similar to those we witnessed\nduring our investigation last year.\n\nSecond, one of the Linux rshell samples used the IP address 45[.]142[.]214[.]193 as its\nC&C. In 2020, that IP address had a particular reverse DNS:\n_[nbaya0u2[.]example[.]com. During our Operation DRBControl investigation, we found](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/br/security/news/cyber-attacks/operation-drbcontrol-uncovering-a-cyberespionage-campaign-targeting-gambling-companies-in-southeast-asia)_\na HyperBro sample that had 138[.]124[.]180[.]108 as its C&C. This second IP address\nhad nbaya0u1[.]example[.]com as its reverse DNS. However, as the rshell sample was\nfound in 2021, we initially did not find this correlation strong enough to attribute the\nrshellmalware family to Iron Tiger.\n\nDespite the fact that same state-sponsored threat actors tend to share their malware\ntools (such as gh0st, PlugX, and Shadowpad), this is not the case for HyperBro as far as\nwe know. The fact that we found this malware being used in this campaign is an\nadditional indicator pointing towards Iron Tiger.\n\nWe also found some links to Earth Berberoka. From one of the victims where we found\n[an rshell sample, we also found a binary belonging to the Reptile rootkit framework, a](https://github.com/f0rb1dd3n/Reptile)\nrootkit identified as part of the arsenal of Earth Berberoka. We also noticed network\ncommunications from this victim to a subdomain of Earth Berberoka, suggesting it could\nhave been previously compromised by this threat actor. We noticed a different system in\nthe same situation, as well as the network connections to the subdomain\n_trust[.]veryssl[.]org domain name. One of the rshell samples had center[.]veryssl[.]org_\nas the C&C. Both findings suggest that those victims could be compromised by both\nthreat actors, or that Earth Berberoka is actually a subgroup of Iron Tiger. As a\nreminder, while investigating Earth Berberoka, we found multiple links to Iron Tiger\n[that we detailed in our research.](https://documents.trendmicro.com/assets/white_papers/wp-operation-earth-berberoka.pdf)\n\nIndicators of Compromise (IOCs)\n\n[You will find the list of IOCs here.](https://www.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/research/22/h/iron-tiger-compromises-chat-application-mimi,-targets-windows,-mac,-and-linux-users/IOCs-IronTiger-compromises-chat-application-mimi-targets-windows-mac-linux-users.txt)\n\n\n-----",
