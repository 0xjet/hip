Companies in the sector are facing a growing risk of having their services interrupted or losing data. The threat to energy firms is only likely to increase in the coming years as new developments, such as further extensions of smart grids and smart metering expose more infrastructure to the Internet. Equipment that is not connected to the Internet and other networks is not immune to threats and there has already been a number of successful attacks against isolated systems. Operators of critical infrastructure, as well as energy utility companies, need to be aware of these threats and prepare accordingly.\n\n The threat to energy firms comes from several different sources. In some cases, espionage from competitors is the primary motive, with data on new projects, exploration and finances being targeted. Disruption and destruction are the goals of other attacks. Some instances appear to be state sponsored, such as the disruption of the Iranian nuclear program by the Stuxnet worm in 2010, one of the attacks that began this trend. Others appear to be the work of hacktivists with political or environmental agendas. Internal attackers, like disgruntled employees, are also a major source of attacks that often lead to service disruption. The majority of the actors behind these attacks have grown more sophisticated in the way they attack.\n\n During the monitoring period from July 2012 to June 2013, we observed an average of 74 targeted attacks per day globally. Of these, nine attacks per day targeted the energy sector. Accounting for 16.3 percent of all attacks, the energy sector was the second most targeted vertical in the last six months of 2012, with only the government/public sector exceeding it with 25.4 percent of all attacks. The high ranking was mainly due to a major attack against a global oil company, which we observed in September 2012. However, in the first half of 2013 the energy sector continued to attract a high proportion of attacks, ranking in fifth place with 7.6 percent of targeted attacks.\n\n Not all of the attacks analyzed used highly sophisticated tools. Most of them could have been prevented by following best practice guidelines for protecting the IT infrastructure and the industrial components, indicating that despite high revenues and strategic importance,\n\n\n-----\n\n### INTRODUCTION\n\n## Many power utilities companies fear disruptive attacks the most, regardless of whether it is done by internal or external attackers.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Introduction\n\nThe number of targeted cyberattacks in general has risen in the past few years. In addition to this, the rate of\nattack exposure has also risen, with more companies becoming aware of attacks, expecting them and searching\nfor indications of compromise. It is not a new phenomenon, but its importance has grown. The Council on\nForeign Relations, a US think tank, reported that energy companies, including oil and gas producers, were often\nthe focus of targeted attacks during summer 2012. In May 2013 the US Department of Homeland Security\n(DHS) warned of an increase in sabotage attacks against US energy companies located in the Middle East. The\ngovernment had tracked multiple attacks and issued a warning together with the Industrial Control Systems\nCyber Emergency Response Team (ICS-CERT). A report by the US Congress supported this picture, stating that\nmany power utilities companies were under constant or daily attack through cyberspace. Taking into account\nthat successful breaches of critical infrastructures are still rare and that these numbers included generic\nmalware infections, it nevertheless highlights the potential for cyberattacks in the energy sector.\n\nAs in most sectors, attackers are often after valuable information. For example, we have seen attackers target\nintellectual property such as technology for photovoltaic research and wind turbines, or data on gas field\nexploration. Information such as this is of high value and can generate huge profits for attackers or their\nsponsors. The same information can also be misused for an act of sabotage. Many power utilities companies fear\ndisruptive attacks the most, regardless of whether it is done by internal or external attackers. The energy sector\nhas a high potential for critical disruption through sabotage attacks. Any interruption to the power grid would\ncause substantial chaos and cascading effects resulting in financial loss.\n\nIn the past there have been quite a few attacks that included targets in the energy sector. Some of these were\n[more focused, like Stuxnet, Duqu, Shamoon/Disttrack and Night Dragon. Others saw power companies targeted](http://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/w32_stuxnet_dossier.pdf)\n[among many other sectors, such as Hidden Lynx, Nitro, Flamer, Net Traveler and Elderwood to name a few.](http://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/hidden_lynx.pdf)\nOne of the biggest examples, and a game changer for many organizations, was Stuxnet. This targeted sabotage\nattack, which is believed to have been aimed against uranium enrichment facilities in Iran, made clear what\ncould be done through cyberattacks.\n\nIt is also clear that the energy sector is not exempt from the generic attacks that every company faces, such\nas ransomware that locks PCs or financial Trojans that attempt to steal passwords and credit card details. For\nexample, such a case happened in May 2013, when a small fuel distribution company in North Carolina fell\n[victim to a cyberheist that transferred US$800,000 from the company’s bank account. Such threats spread](http://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/05/nc-fuel-distributor-hit-by-800000-cyberheist/)\nbroadly and might impact any person, regardless of their employer. These attackers aim at infecting as many\ncomputers as possible in order to maximize their chances of profits. These attacks can include nonspecific data\nbreaches where employee or customer records get stolen, as happened to the US Department of Energy in July\n2013.\n\nFor this paper we focused on email data from targeted attacks between July 2012 and June 2013. Even though\nwatering holes are becoming more frequently used in targeted attacks, it is unfortunately quite difficult to\nreliably map these to individual campaigns. A blocked drive-by download attempt does not give any indication\nif it was a targeted attack or just general noise. In quite a few cases we see the same common malware, like\nPoison Ivy, being used by generic attackers and by targeted attacks. In such cases the sole difference between a\nsophisticated targeted attack and a generic one lies in the person commanding the malware.\n\n\n-----\n\n### EXPOSED SYSTEMS: ONLINE AND OFFLINE\n\n## Experts predict that billions of smart meters and sensors will be installed worldwide over the next ten years.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Exposed systems: Online and offline\n\nHistorically most industrial control systems (ICS) and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems\nwere in separated networks not connected to the Internet or any other network. Unfortunately this security\nthrough segregation approach does not fully protect against cyberattacks. In reality, networks are rarely\ncompletely isolated. Often some configuration updates are periodically installed or log files are transferred. If\nsystems are not directly connected, the method of choice for these types of interactions is usually through a USB\nstick or a non-permanent modem connection, which provides a way into the restricted networks. This allows\nmalware to spread into such isolated networks as demonstrated many times by threats such as Stuxnet.\n\nIf networks are truly segregated, this would mean that there would be no software updates installed, leaving\nold vulnerabilities open. There are also issues around processes. For example, the revocation lists for digital\ncertificates are seldom updated and therefore certificates which are no longer valid cannot be checked properly\nand would still be accepted.\n\nWith the increasing desire for connectivity now reaching industrial plants, many operators have started to\nconnect their ICS to the Internet. New adapters can bridge to older technology which was never intended to be\ncontrolled over the Internet, allowing it to be connected easily. This allows for efficient centralized monitoring\nand, to some extent, remote control of equipment.\n\nDepending on the type of machinery controlled through the human-machine interface (HMI) of the ICS, not all\nmodifications are possible. Some systems are physically connected in a pure read-only mode for monitoring.\nAnd even if they are fully connected, some turbines have physical limitations or emergency systems based on\nphysical effects that cannot be overridden by the digital controller. Thus, not all Hollywood scenarios of open\nflood gates or turbines that fly through the air are possible. However, sabotage attacks that damage equipment\nare definitely possible, as has already been demonstrated. In the future, more systems are going to implement\nthe failsafe switches in software, opening up the vector for malware attacks.\n\nAn additional source of concern is that some countries have started to open the energy market for smaller\nprivate contributors. This means that almost anyone can use mini power plants like water, wind or photovoltaic\nsites to feed energy back into the power grid. Often these operators do not have a full IT staff supporting\nthe facilities at hand, which might lead to more vulnerable installations. Furthermore they may deploy new\ntechnology which might be untested and contain some unknown vulnerabilities. While these smaller sites make\nup only a small portion of the grid, new decentralized power input feeds are a challenge for the balance of the\npower grid as well and need to be carefully monitored. Small outages or changes can have a domino effect for\nthe whole power grid.\n\n[To increase the exposure of energy firms even further, sites like SHODAN, which is essentially a search engine](http://www.shodanhq.com/)\nfor devices, enable anyone to easily find exposed controllers on the Internet. Of course not all of the industrial\ncontrol systems connected to the Internet are critical systems or even real ones. Some researchers have started\nto create honey pot systems in order to study the attackers, which have apparently already attracted attackers\nlike the Comment Crew/APT1 group, who have broken into these decoy systems.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Smart grid: A new potential avenue of attack\n\nSmart grids and smart metering are\nbringing significant change to\nthe world’s power systems.\nExperts predict that\nbillions of smart meters\nand sensors will be\ninstalled worldwide\nover the next ten\nyears. They enable\nutility companies\nto measure energy\nconsumption at a\nmore granular\nlevel, creating\nbetter flow\npatterns and\nenabling\ndifferent\nprices for\nconsumption\nbased on\nthe time of day and\nlocation. This development\nbrings new opportunities, as well\nas new challenges.\n\nAs with any connected infrastructure, it is important to\nsecure the network and its endpoint on multiple levels. There have\nalready been proof of concept attacks that demonstrate how smart meters could be manipulated to send\nback false information or report incorrect billing IDs, leading to power theft.\n\nIn addition to the issue of securing these devices, smart grids will produce a huge amount of data which,\ndepending on regulations, will need to be kept for audits. Some of this data may be sensitive and could raise\nprivacy concerns if not properly protected. This could easily grow to petabytes of data that needs to be safely\nstored and managed.\n\nIt is beyond the scope of this paper to address all the challenges associated with smart grids and smart meters.\n[Symantec has created a dedicated whitepaper for this topic: How to protect critical infrastructure, mitigate fraud](http://www.symantec.com/en/au/content/en/us/enterprise/executive_report/b-how-to-protect-critical-infrastructure.en-us.pdf)\n[and guarantee privacy. As a member of the CRISALIS project, Symantec is following these developments closely](http://www.symantec.com/en/au/content/en/us/enterprise/executive_report/b-how-to-protect-critical-infrastructure.en-us.pdf)\nand is helping to secure critical infrastructure together with partners from academia and different industry\nsectors.\n\n\n-----\n\n### HISTORY OF DISCOVERED ATTACKS\n\n## There have been numerous cyberattacks against the energy sector over the past few years.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### History of discovered attacks\n\nThere have been numerous cyberattacks against the energy sector over the past few years. Not all of them were\nthe work of sophisticated attackers; some incidents were just collateral damage caused by malware infections or\nbad configuration issues. These incidents highlight the fact that such attacks can happen and that they can have\nreal life consequences.\n\n##### 2013\n\nIn 2013 part of the Austrian and German power grid nearly broke down after a control command was\naccidentally misdirected. It is believed that a status request command packet, which was broadcast from a\nGerman gas company as a test for their newly installed network branch, found its way into the systems of the\nAustrian energy power control and monitoring network. Once there, the message generated thousands of reply\nmessages, which generated even more data packages, which in turn flooded the control network. To stop this\nself-inflicted DDoS attack, part of the monitoring and control network had to be isolated and disconnected.\nFortunately the situation was resolved without any power outages.\n\n##### 2008\n\nIn 2008, Tom Donahue, a senior Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) official told a meeting of utility company\nrepresentatives that cyberattacks had taken out power equipment in multiple cities outside the United States.\nIn some cases the attacker tried to extort money from the energy companies, threatening them with further\nblackouts.\n\n##### 2003\n\nIn 2003 the safety monitoring system of the Ohio nuclear power plant apparently went offline for several hours\ndue to a Slammer worm infection. Fortunately the power plant was already offline due to maintenance and the\ninstalled secondary backup monitoring system was unaffected by the worm. Nevertheless the incident raised\nsafety concerns.\n\nAt the beginning of 2003 a marine terminal in Venezuela was targeted by a sabotage attack. Details of this attack\nare scarce and vague, but it seems that during a strike an attacking group managed to get access to the SCADA\nnetwork of the oil tanker loading machinery and overwrote programmable logic controllers (PLCs) with an empty\nprogram module. This halted machinery, preventing oil tankers from loading for eight hour till the unaffected\nbackup code was reinstalled on the PLCs. The attack was not too sophisticated as it was easily spotted. A small\nmodification of the PLC code instead would probably have gone unnoticed for a long time.\n\n##### 2001\n\nIn 2001 an attack took place against California’s power distribution center, which controls the flow of electricity\nacross California. Due to apparently poor security configuration, the attacker was able to compromise two Web\nservers that were part of a developer network and penetrate further from there. Fortunately the attackers were\nstopped before they managed to attack any systems which were tied into the transmission grid for the Western\nUnited States.\n\n##### 2000\n\nAccording to Russian officials, the largest natural gas extraction company in the country was successfully\nattacked in 2000. The attackers used a Trojan to gain access to the control for the gas pipelines. Through this\nswitchboard, the flow for individual gas pipelines could have been modified, which would easily have caused\nwidespread disruption.\n\n\n-----\n\nAside from these incidents, there have also been a number of more serious and well-documented targeted\nattacks against the energy sector:\n\n##### Stuxnet\n\nThe Stuxnet incident and its relatives Duqu, Flamer and Gauss are some of the most talked-about cases of\ntargeted attacks. As far as we know today, the Stuxnet operation began in November 2005 with the registration\nof the command and control (C&C) servers used in the attacks. The first recorded appearance of what we now\ncall Stuxnet version 0.5 was in November 2007. Since then, a handful of different versions have been found and\nanalyzed. Stuxnet 1.x is based on what is now known as the “tilded” platform; whereas Stuxnet 0.5 is based\non the Flamer framework. The code segments and programming style differ, which indicates that two different\nprogramming teams were most likely responsible for the different branches of Stuxnet. Thorough investigation\ninto the mechanism and functions of this threat started in July 2010. Stuxnet is the first known autonomous\nthreat to target and sabotage industrial control systems to such an extent.\n\nStuxnet is a sophisticated piece of malware, which uses seven vulnerabilities to spread and infect its targets.\n[The most notable vulnerability is the Microsoft Windows Shortcut ‘LNK/PIF’ Files Automatic File Execution](http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/41732)\n[Vulnerability (CVE-2010-2568), which allows it to auto-execute on USB drives. Spreading through infected](http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/41732)\nportable media drives allowed it to also infect networks isolated by air gaps that are unreachable from the\nInternet. This was most likely the first infection vector used by Stuxnet. In addition, it is able to infect Step7\nproject files, which are used to control Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs). This allowed the worm to infect\ncomputers whenever the engineer exchanged the project files. Besides this, it also spread through network\nshares, a printer spooler vulnerability, an old Windows RPC (remote procedure calls) vulnerability and a known\npassword in the WinCC database. In the end, Stuxnet propagated further than its authors probably intended. We\nhave monitored more than 40,000 infected IP addresses in 155 countries. Many of those systems are most likely\njust collateral damage and were not intended to be infected by the attackers. For example multiple computers at\nChevron were infected by Stuxnet, without any damage being done.\n\nPart of the malware code was signed with stolen digital certificates making it harder to detect by security tools.\nTo hide its activity even further, Stuxnet executed slightly different infection routines depending on the security\nsoftware installed on the target. On the USB drive itself, the malware would hide its own files and even delete\nitself from it after three successful propagations. Tricks like these, to make the detection of the malware more\ndifficult, are now frequently used in modern targeted attacks.\n\nStuxnet’s payload focused on PLCs, which are used to control different industrial components. The target of the\nStuxnet operation is believed to be a uranium enrichment facility in Iran. The sabotage payload disrupted and\npartially destroyed the cascaded high frequency gas centrifuges. The early version of Stuxnet targeted the S7-\n417 PLCs and modified its valve settings. Closing the valves at certain points in time would lead to an increase\nof pressure that could damage the equipment. The later version of the threat focused on the S7-315 PLCs,\nmanipulating the spinning frequency of the rotating motors. By speeding the centrifuges up and slowing them\ndown repeatedly, the output quality could be spoiled and the centrifuges themselves could be damaged. The\npayload would only become active if the fingerprint in the found PLC setup matched a given configuration setup.\nThis minimized the collateral damage at other facilities and showed that the attackers had in-depth knowledge\nof the targeted uranium enrichment facilities. To avoid detection by personnel monitoring the human machine\ninterface (HMI) of the plant, the threat recorded measurement readings during normal operation and played\nthose back in a loop.\n\n##### Night Dragon\n\nOperation Night Dragon, which was uncovered in 2010, is a typical example of global oil companies being\ntargeted, but this time not with the aim of disruption in mind. The attacks started in late 2009 and were directed\nat finding project details and financial information about oil and gas field exploration and bids.\n\nThe attackers started by compromising public facing Web servers through SQL injection and installing Web\nshells on them. Once they had control over the server they used common hacking tools to harvest local\n\n\n-----\n\npasswords, dump password hashes, sniff authentication messages and exploit internal active directory\nconfiguration. This allowed them to move on to other internal computers using the gathered passwords. In\naddition, spear phishing messages were used to compromise additional computers. The attackers did not use\nany zero-day vulnerabilities during their attacks. Rather they used publicly available tools for each individual job.\n\n[On compromised computers a common Backdoor.Trojan was installed that communicated back to the](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2001-062614-1754-99)\nC&C server, allowing remote access to the computer. This allowed the attacker to find and extract valuable\ninformation.\n\n##### Shamoon/Disttrack\n\nIn August 2012 an extremely destructive cyberattack hit an estimated 30,000 computers at one of the largest oil\n[producers of the world in Saudi Arabia. The W32.Disttrack malware used in this attack, also known as Shamoon,](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2012-081608-0202-99)\nconsists of three components: a dropper, a wiper and a reporter module.\n\nThe dropper component is responsible for creating all the required files on the system, registering a service\ncalled “TrkSvr” in order to start itself with Windows. It also attempts to copy itself to accessible network shares\nand execute itself remotely if successfully copied.\n\nThe wiper component is only activated when a hardcoded configuration date has been passed. This enables a\ncoordinated, “time bomb” scenario. The module then drops a legitimate and digitally signed device driver that\nprovides low level disk access from user space. The malware collects file names and starts overwriting them\nwith a JPEG image or 192KB blocks of random data. At the end Disttrack finishes the computer off by wiping the\nmaster boot record with the same data.\n\nThe reporter component is responsible for sending back a HTTP GET request to the C&C server. It reports the\ndomain name, IP address and number of files overwritten.\n\nBy acquiring user credentials and gaining access to the domain controller the attackers were able to push the\nmalware on to many systems before they triggered the destructive payload. Disttrack’s secondary goal may have\nbeen to steal valuable information from infected computers, but the main intent was to render the computers\nunusable by wiping the operating system and master boot record, causing disruption and downtime at the\ntargeted company. Although wiping is also frequently used to destroy evidence of the attack and make forensics\nmore difficult. The malware does not contain any payload against ICS, like Stuxnet does for PLCs, and is not as\nsophisticated. According to the company, no computer related with the production or distribution of oil was\naffected, since the operational network is separated and specially protected.\n\nOne group that claimed responsibility for the attack posted on Pastebin that it was an anti-oppression hacker\ngroup. The attack was prompted by disappointment with some of the regimes in the Middle East, the group said.\nTrue or not, this shows that it is not necessarily only state-sponsored attackers who are carrying out disruptive\nattacks. Sabotage attacks usually fall into the orbit of hacktivists, who seek attention rather than profit. Some\nsources reported that the attackers had help from insiders, which would explain the so far unclear infection\nvector.\n\nSoon after this attack became known, a Qatari gas company was attacked in a similar way.\n\n\n-----\n\n### SPEAR PHISHING ATTACKS IN THE ENERGY SECTOR\n\n## A spear phishing attack consists of an email with either a malicious attachment or a link to a malicious website.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Spear phishing attacks in the energy sector\n\nSpear phishing is, along with watering hole attacks, one of the most common attack vectors used to\nattack companies. The attacks are simple to carry out. They often follow the same pattern, starting with a\nreconnaissance phase to gather all publicly available information. This is followed by the incursion phase of\nbreaking in and compromising computers. After that comes the discovery phase, where the attacker gathers\npasswords and maps the internal network. The final stage is capture and exfiltration, where the valuable\ninformation is copied and sent back to the attacker. The last phase may also involve a disruption attack if the\ngoal is sabotage. For a more detailed analysis of the attack phases, see Appendix C.\n\nA spear phishing attack consists of an email with either a malicious attachment or a link to a malicious website.\nSuch emails are sent in bulk to a handful of key users. These waves are often repeated till enough people fall for\nthe bait and compromise their computers. For analysis on the social engineering themes used, attack details and\nattachment types used, see Appendix A.\n\n##### New Year’s campaign\n\nSome of the spear phishing campaigns are smaller in scale and are focused on specific targets. For example, on\nJanuary 1, 2013 a global energy research company was targeted.\n\nA wave of spear phishing emails were sent from two Freemailer accounts to 291 individuals at the targeted\ncompany. All receiving email addresses started with a letter between G and R, covering half of the alphabet.\nWhether there was a second wave of emails using the other half of the alphabet or whether the attackers only\ngot their hands on part of the address book remains unknown.\n\nAll emails had either the subject line “2013,Obama QE4! Merry Christmas !” or “2013,Obama QE4!”. It is\ncommon to see spear phishing attacks take place around holidays, as people are receiving more emails during\nthese times and are less likely to perform due diligence while opening them. All of the emails contained the same\n[Trojan.Dropper disguised as an attachment with the filename AVP.dll.](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2002-082718-3007-99)\n\nThe malware itself drops a malicious Downloader “clbcatq.dll” into a newly created “wuauclt” directory, posing\nas Windows update and taking advantage of the DLL search order hijack weakness in order to load the malicious\ncode in Windows. The same family of dropper has been used in previous targeted attacks against other sectors,\nindicating that a group with multiple interests is behind the attacks. The back door provided full access to the\ncompromised computers.\n\nA week later, on January 7, 2013, the group attacked the same company again. Seventy emails were sent to\n58 individuals using either “2012-13 NFL Playoffs Schedule” or “Re: 2012-13 NFL Playoffs Schedule” as a\nsubject line. In this wave, the attackers used a similar AVP.dll to the one used before. In some of the emails, an\nadditional CHM file with an old exploit was used in an effort to maximize the chances of a successful infection.\n\nAfter this second wave, the attack ceased. It is unknown if the attackers successfully retrieved the information\nthey were seeking, if they installed other back door Trojans or gained passwords that allowed them to directly\naccess the computers, or if they have given up on the target.\n\n##### Greek oil campaign\n\nA global oil company, with offices around the world, had been under continuous attack for some time, but in\nSeptember 2012 we noticed an upsurge in activity, with 34 times more suspicious emails than on average. This\nprovided a clear indication that something suspicious was going on. At the end of this wave of emails, a hotel\nchain, a rental car company and two financial institutions were also targeted by the same attacker. This may\nhave been an attempt to find further information that could be used in a future social engineering attack against\nthe oil company.\n\nIn total, 136 email accounts at the oil company were targeted. A regional sales manager in Greece received\n\n\n-----\n\n412 emails over the\n12 month period,\nwith 155 different\nattachments. A HR\nperson in the same\ncountry received\nthe second largest\namount of emails with\n90 in total. Seventeen\nother people were\ntargeted between 70\nand 90 times, many in\nthe same region. The\nrest of the targeted\npeople received less\nthan five emails each,\nin what seems to have\n\n_Figure 1. Number of emails targeting the company per day_\n\nbeen an undirected\nspraying in the hope\nthat at least some would fall for the bait. Clearly the one person that received the highest volume of emails was\ndeemed to be of high value to the attackers. Possible explanations for the attack could be that a competitor\nwanted to know more about some upcoming deal or details on the oil field exploration, but this would be highly\nspeculative.\n\nThe spear phishing emails came from 234 spoofed addresses. They were made to appear to be linked to the\ncompany in relation to the subject and attachment chosen. Many of the emails came from the same country as\nthe main targeted sales manager.\n\nThe emails all contained malicious attachments. None of them linked to third party sites for drive-by downloads.\nOf the attachments, 1,588 had a .exe extension. Of those, 842 had a .pdf.exe extension. The malware chosen\n[was a variant of the Poison Ivy Trojan Backdoor.Darkmoon and, in some minor cases, Trojan droppers that would](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2005-081910-3934-99)\ndownload additional malware. The attackers did not use any zero-day exploits to drop a payload.\n\nThe social engineering messages concentrated mainly around the following two themes:\n\nE-books and newspapers:\n\n        - E-Book.pdf.exe\n\n        - BusinessWeek.pdf.exe\n\n        - Financial Times E-Paper.pdf.exe\n\n        - The Economist Print Edition.pdf.exe\n\n        - The NY Times In Print.pdf.exe\n\nFree desktop tools:\n\n        - Babylon9 - Greek.exe\n\n        - Google Desktop Translator.exe\n\n        - SMS Free Sender Desktop.exe\n\n        - BBC iPlayer.exe\n\n        - Sticky Notes Desktop.exe\n\nOnce installed, the back door would create a registry run key in order to restart with Windows and connect to\none of three C&C servers located in Greece. The last C&C server has been used since 2010 in similar attacks\nagainst other companies. Other sub-domains at the same free host and DNS service have been used by other\ngroups to spread malware in the past.\n\n        - updates.zyns.com\n\n        - amazoaws.dyndns-office.com\n\n        - msupdate.3utilities.com\n\n\n-----\n\nThe chosen names of the C&C server domains imitates legitimate services in a bid to be overlooked by the system\nadministrators when checking their logs.\n\nThe back door provides full remote access to the compromised computers, allowing for extraction of any data. It is\nunknown if the attackers succeeded in their goal and if valuable information has been extracted. The attacks did not\ncompletely disappear, but the email volume decreased significantly to only a few emails per week afterwards.\n\n#### Motivation and origin\n\nAs with all targeted attacks, there are many different groups of attackers operating in this field. These attacks cannot\nbe attributed to only one group or geographical region. We have seen individuals, competitors, hacktivist groups\nand possible state sponsored agents carrying out attacks against energy companies. Some of the attacks have been\npurely opportunistic, seeking any valuable information available. Other campaigns look like they were planned over a\nlengthy period and carried out methodically with a clear goal in mind.\n\nThe attackers tend to go after valuable information, including maps of new gas fields or research on efficient\nphotovoltaic generators. This information can be of great value to competitors or nations that want to make progress\nin the same field. Another motivation for attackers is to profit from the information stolen by blackmailing the\ncompany.\n\nThe same information can be used to carry out sabotage attacks designed to disrupt ICSs, as the energy sector is\nalso a primary target for sabotage attacks which will not generate direct profit for the attacker. A competitor might\nbe interested in generating bad press and bad customer experience for a rival company, in order to win some new\nclients.\n\n[For example, in January 2013 a group claiming to be related to Anonymous posted access details for what they said](http://www.technewsdaily.com/7459-anonymous-how-israeli-power-stations.html)\n[were Israeli SCADA systems for power plants and other systems. Meanwhile, “Operation Save the Arctic” targeted](http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2012/07/16/Anonymous-Hacker-Leaks-Employee-Email-Accounts-of-Oil-Companies-to-Support-Greenpeace-Campaign)\nmultiple oil companies around the globe in protest against drilling plans in the Arctic.\n\nDisgruntled employees are also a source of attacks that should not be underestimated. With their knowhow about\ninternal critical processes and systems they often know how to inflict serious damage. They may be able to perform\nsystem modifications that could go unnoticed for a long periods.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Protection and mitigation\n\nFor all regular client computers, the well-established best practice guidelines apply. These computers are often\nthe first ones to be attacked. Once compromised, the attacker will use these computers and try to explore deeper\ninto internal networks. Securing and hardening of deployed operating systems with a working strategy for patch\ndeployment is important. Reoccurring security awareness training can help users to identify social engineering\nattempts and prevent them from falling victim to them in the first place.\n\nThe company can perform penetration testing on Web and network applications but also on ICSs to identify and\nremedy any vulnerability. For examples Web applications should be tested against SQL injection attacks. This can\nalso help confirm if applied polices are followed through, if the patch level is correct on all computers and if systems\nare compliant.\n\nCompanies can monitor the Internet for information about attacks in the same vertical and apply lessons learned\nwhere possible.\n\nIn addition, different layers of security products can help achieve better overall protection.\n\n**• Security Information and Event Manager system (SIEM): Using a SIEM can help correlate all related alerts in**\none place. This centralized view can be cross referenced with threat intelligence data to generate prioritization and\nan action plan. Painting the bigger picture of the overall security state can reveal previously unnoticed attacks.\nFor example failed login attempts on internal servers could indicate a password breach. This includes logging of\ncritical systems and synchronization of time among multiple systems.\n\n**• Ingress and egress filtering: Filtering the network traffic with firewalls, content filters and IPS allows the control**\nof data flows. This can prevent attackers from reaching internal systems. It is important to also monitor outbound\ntraffic, as data exfiltration is a key point for cyberespionage. It should be noted that with the increased use of\ncloud services and mobile devices, some traffic might never pass through the company’s gateways. Where traffic\nblocking is too disruptive at least monitoring should be implemented.\n\n**• Data loss prevention (DLP): DLP solutions can track the access and flow of critical information and prevent it**\nfrom leaving the company or encrypt it automatically.\n\n**• Endpoint protection: Depending on the usage pattern of the computer, different solutions are available to protect**\nthe endpoint. Antivirus solution with proactive detection methods like behavioral analysis and reputation scanning\ncan prevent unknown malware from installing itself. HIPS (host based intrusion prevention systems), behavioral\nlockdown or whitelisting can protect computers from any kind of unwanted tampering without the need of\nconstant updates.\n\n**• System protection: For non-standard IT systems, hardening can increase the security. On industrial systems**\nwhich are not often updated or that cannot be updated, exploitation can be prevented with the help of lockdown\nsolutions like Symantec Critical System Protection (CSP). Through policies, only trusted system applications are\nallowed to run. ICS should be regularly checked and upgraded if new firmware exists. Where this is not possible\nHIPS and behavioral lockdown tools can be used to secure computers.\n\n**• Email filtering: Proper email filtering can prevent many spear phishing attempts from reaching users. They can**\nhelp minimize the risk of an untrained user falling for social engineering tricks.\n\n**• Authentication: Some of the ICS contain hardcoded passwords and, wherever possible, these should be changed.**\nICS frequently use weakly authenticated protocols that allow for impersonation attacks. Where possible those\nauthentication methods should be upgraded or at least closely monitored. Strong authentication or PKI should be\nused where applicable.\n\nIndustrial control systems (ICS) should be specially protected and monitored. The control system and control\nnetwork should be secured. Where possible, ICS should be separate from the Intranet. Isolating these networks alone\nis often not enough to protect the control network, but it can make it more difficult for attackers to succeed. For\nsome systems it can make sense to have a plan to quickly disconnect or separate critical machines in the event of a\ndetected cyberattack.\n\n\n-----\n\n### CONCLUSION\n\n## In the second half of 2012, the energy sector was the second most targeted with 16 percent of all the targeted attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nCyberespionage campaigns and sabotage attacks are becoming increasingly common, with countless threat\nactors attempting to gain a foothold in some of the best protected organizations. At this stage, roughly\nfive targeted attacks per day are being mounted on firms in the energy sector. These attacks have become\nincreasingly sophisticated, although the capabilities and tactics used by these threat actors vary considerably.\n\nIn the second half of 2012, the energy sector was the second most targeted with 16 percent of all the targeted\nattacks. This strong increase was mainly due to a large scale attack against one global oil company. In the first\nhalf of 2013, the energy sector was ranked fifth with 7.6 percent of all attacks focused on this sector. In general\nwe have observed that attackers are becoming more efficient and focusing on smaller operations that attract\nless attention.\n\nThe attackers tend to go after valuable information – such as maps of a new gas field – but the sector is also\na major target for sabotage attacks, which will not generate direct profit for the attacker. Such disruptive\nattacks do already happen and may lead to large financial losses. State sponsored agents, competitors, internal\nattackers or hacktivists are the most likely authors of such sabotage attacks.\n\nFortunately, there have not been many successful sabotage attacks against energy companies to date. However,\nthe increasing number of connected systems and centralized control for ICS systems means that the risk\nof attacks in the future will increase. Energy and utility companies need to be aware of these risks and plan\naccordingly to protect their valuable information as well as their ICS or SCADA networks.\n\n\n-----\n\n### APPENDIX\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Appendix\n\n##### A. Spear phishing\n\n###### Social engineering themes used\n\nSocial engineering is an essential part of spear phishing campaigns. A cleverly chosen, enticing message may prompt\nthe user into opening an attachment. It is evident that most attackers are carefully selecting the themes that they\nuse for their attacks. Some groups use real news stories and copy the text directly from the newspaper websites.\nOthers try to appeal to personal hobbies in order to get the user’s attention.\n\nIn the energy sector the most commonly used theme for spear phishing emails was money related (e.g. “Wage Data\n2012”) followed by sports related themes (e.g. “2012-13 NFL Playoffs Schedule”).\n\nAs an example, the subject line “Wage Data 2012” was used in 944 emails, sent from 26 different email addresses\nto targets in nine different sectors. The attack was carried out over eight days and used the same infected Microsoft\nWord document in every instance.\n\nIn general any topic can be used in a social engineering attempt, which makes it even harder for regular users to spot\nthe attacks. Here are a few examples of subject lines used, listed by category:\n\n**Contact detail updates:**\n\n        - Updated Corporate & Regional Office Contact Information\n\n        - Updated Information For Contact List\n\n        - Address Change\n\n**Event and conference details:**\n\n        - The Energy and Economic Summit 2012\n\n         - 12th Annual International Conference on Politics & International\n\n        - Fw: Doha Climate Change Conference - November 2012\n\n        - US Energy Information Administration Invitation\n\n**Global news stories:**\n\n       - BREAKING NEWS PHOTOS,BEIJING\n\n        - President Obamas Asia Policy and Upcoming Trip to the Region\n\n        - DoD Protection of Whistleblowing Spies\n\n        - U.S. Engagement in the Pacific\n\n**Money related:**\n\n       - Acknowledge Payment\n\n        - Payroll Invoice for week ending 02/15/2013 - 09509\n\n        - Bank Details/Swift Code Error\n\n        - Unable to process your most recent Payment\n\n**Sport related:**\n\n        - 2012 NFL Schedule\n\n        - 2012-13 NFL Playoffs Schedule\n\n        - 2012-08-02 Thursdays sixth day of the 2012 Olympic Games\n\n        - London 2012 Medal Top 10\n\n**Lifestyle related:**\n\n        - 125 Best Foods for Men\n\n         - 2013 Lingerie Calendar... discover your deepest desires!\n\n\n-----\n\n         - 8 Minutes to a Longer Life\n\n**Special interest groups:**\n\n        - Shamoon Upgrade Edition Malware Might Be Flame Copycat!\n\n         - CyberAlert: Cyberattacks spread in banks all over the world\n\n         - 3D printing technology used in Chinese fighter jets\n\n        - 2013 Defense Industries Manufacturing\n###### Spear phishing attack details\n\nIn the last six month of 2012 the average\nnumber of targeted attacks observed per\nday was 87 (with 14 in the energy sector).\nIn the first six month of 2013 the average\nnumber decreased to 60 targeted attacks\nper day (five in the energy sector). The\nspike in August and September 2012\nis mostly related to a large scale attack\nagainst a global oil company. The increase\nin May 2013 was due to multiple attacks\nagainst financial services, public sector\nand IT service organizations.\n\nThe government and public sector was\nquantitatively the most attacked sector,\nwith 25.4 percent of all targeted attacks\nfalling in this sector for the last half of\n2012 and 24 percent for the first half of _Figure 2: Number of targeted attacks per day_\n2013. The energy sector accounted for 7.6\npercent of all targeted attacks, making it\nthe fifth most targeted sector in the first six month of 2013. This was a big decrease from 16.3 percent of all attacks\nin the last half of 2012, when it was the second most attacked sector. This spike in 2012 is mainly due to a large\nattack campaign against a global oil company which took place in September 2012.\n\nOn average we saw\n18.6 mail accounts\nbeing attacked for\nany given target\ncompany in the\nlast half of 2012\n(60.7 in the energy\nsector) and 5.6 email\naccounts in the first\nhalf of 2013 (10 in\nthe energy sector).\nOverall, we see a\ntrend of the attacker\nconducting more\nfocused attacks\nagainst fewer\nindividuals. This\ngenerates less noise\nand the risk of getting\nnoticed or discovered\nis smaller. These\nemails are sent in\n_Figure 3: Top 10 of targeted attacks by vertical sectors_\nsmall bursts and then\n\n\n-----\n\nrepeated against a changing\ntarget space till enough\ncomputers are compromised.\n\n###### Attachment types used\n\nHalf of all the attachments\nanalyzed used an extension that\nwould run directly when double\nclicked. This old method is still\nthe most common scheme used.\nOf all attachments analyzed,\n38 percent were .exe and 12\npercent were .src files. In total\nonly 6 percent used double\nextensions like .pdf.exe to fool\n\n_Figure 4: Average number of mail accounts targeted per company_\n\nthe user. It should also be noted\nthat 23 percent were Microsoft\nWord documents using some exploit to execute custom code on the computer.\n\nThere were also some more exotic\nextensions used like AutoIt scripts\n(.au3) and ZX-Edit files (.zed), but\nthese are the exception rather\nthan the rule. It might be that the\nattackers tried to bypass some email\nfiltering software by experimenting\nwith different attachment types.\nSometimes even older exploits like\n[the Microsoft DirectX DirectShow](http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/35616)\n[Length Record Remote Code](http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/35616)\n[Execution Vulnerability (CVE-](http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/35616)\n2009-1539) in .mp4 files are still\noccasionally used. This indicates\nthat either not all attackers have\nthe knowhow to use newer exploits\nthat are publicly available or they\nspeculate that the target has not\npatched all computers. Some of\nthe attackers do not seem to be too\nsophisticated. For example they used\n“www.[COMPANY-NAME].com.exe” as\nan attachment name, clearly missing\nthat the “.com” at the end would be\nsufficient to run it and the additional\n“.exe” was not needed.\n\n_Figure 5: Extensions used in targeted attack emails_\n\n\n-----\n\n##### B. Visualization with TRIAGE\n\nTo identify a series of targeted attacks that are likely performed by the same individuals, we have used a novel attack\n[attribution methodology named TRIAGE. Developed by Symantec Research Labs, TRIAGE is data mining software that](http://www.symantec.com/about/profile/researchlabs.jsp)\nrelies on multi-criteria decision analysis and intelligent data fusion algorithms to reliably link different attacks to the\nsame source. This framework has been developed in order to automate cyberintelligence tasks and reduce the time\nneeded to get insights into organized cybercrime activities. By enabling rapid analysis of large security data sets,\nSymantec analysts can then quickly and more efficiently attribute various waves of cyberattacks to a specific attack\ncampaign likely run by the same individuals.\n\n_Figure 6: Graph view of attack wave against company targeted in the New Year’s campaign_\n\n[The TRIAGE framework was recently enhanced with novel visualizations thanks to VIS-SENSE, a European research](http://www.vis-sense.eu/)\nproject aiming at developing visual analytics technologies for network security applications.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7: Visualization graph of the Greek oil campaign_\n\nSince its original conception, TRIAGE has been\nsuccessfully used to analyze the behavior of\ncybercriminals involved in various types of Internet\nattack activities, such as rogue antivirus websites [1],\nspam botnets operations [2], scam campaigns [3] and\ntargeted attacks performed via spear phishing emails\n\n[4,5].\n\n##### C. Phases of targeted attacks\n\nAs with any other targeted attacks, attacks against\nthe energy sector often follow the same pattern. It\ncan be broken down in different phases of attack. It\nshould be noted that we have seen attackers modify\ntheir behavior and exceptions from the norm and this\nis possible especially if the target company has special\ncircumstances or security measures in place.\n\n_Figure 8: Typical phases of targeted attacks_\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Reconnaissance phase\n\nDuring this phase the attacker tries to learn as much as possible about the targeted organization.\n\nInformation sources often include social networks, job posting sites and press releases. This enables the attacker\nto learn the contact details of possible target individuals as well as context that can be used in social engineering\nscenarios. The attacker will often create a list of implemented security software used at the targeted company\nfrom whatever information is available. These investigations often start completely passively without any direct\ncontact with the company, since there are many data sources publicly available. Subsequently the attacker can use\nmore interaction if needed. Some attackers go through all the effort of creating a fake social media account and\nbefriending key employees. After a period of small talk, to create a false sense of security, such a connection can\nthen be used to pass on an infected document or find out about some key information. Depending on the targeted\nlocation, physical reconnaissance and eavesdropping may also be used.\n\n###### Incursion phase\n\nThe actual break-in occurs during this phase. The attacker usually compromises the network by delivering targeted\nmalware to vulnerable systems or employees. There are two main avenues of attack. One is to send spear phishing\nemails, where a link to a malicious website or a malicious attachment is delivered using social engineering\ntechniques. The second method, which is gaining traction, is watering hole attacks, where the attacker infects a\nwebsite that has a high likelihood of being visited by the intended victim. By using IP address filters before infecting\nany visitor of such sites, the attacker can reduce the number of infected systems and bring it to a manageable\nquantity which can be assessed manually at another time.\n\n[Some groups carefully plan watering hole attacks. For example the Hidden Lynx group stopped using a zero-day](http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/hidden-lynx-professional-hackers-hire)\nvulnerability in a large watering hole attack after Microsoft released details on the vulnerability. This helped to cover\ntheir activities and avoid unwanted attention. A few days later the group resumed the watering hole attack again,\nthis time using a different exploit.\n\nFor more difficult targets, man-in-the-middle attacks can be used. These can be performed either at the same\nphysical location, posing as a genuine Wi-Fi hotspot or through supply chain attacks. This can enable the attacker to\nswap an update of legitimate software for a maliciously crafted version. Once the victim installs the genuine looking\nupdate, the attacker effectively gains control over the computer. Due to the complexity of such an attack, they are\nrarely used. Depending on the skills of the attacker and the time available, the attacker might also attack systems at\nthe perimeter, such as Web servers, and try to break in from there.\n\nThe malware used is not always sophisticated. Sometimes a regular off-the-shelf back door Trojan is used. In\nthese cases the person behind the malware orchestrating the commands is what makes the difference between a\ntargeted attack and a broad generic infection. Having said this, on very unique targets, we will often see the use\nof a specifically designed piece malware, such as in the case of Stuxnet. Depending on the protection measures\nimplemented by the target, the attackers may also digitally sign their malware creation. In the past there have been\nquite a few cases where code signing certificates were stolen and later misused to sign malware in order to pass it\nunnoticed to high value targets.\n\n###### Discovery phase\n\nOnce the attacker has a foothold on one system, the next step is to create a plan for lateral movement through the\nnetwork until the interesting data is found. With more specialized teams of attackers, we can often observe that the\ninfected system is first analyzed to ensure that it is of interest to them. With watering hole attacks especially, it can\nhappen that computers that were not targeted get infected. Infected computers need to be assessed by the attacker\nand, if necessary, removed to keep the profile, and with that the chances of exposure, low.\n\nOne of the obvious tasks performed by attackers is to install key loggers, dump local credentials, search local\nstorage for saved accounts and sniff the network for passwords. Any account detail can be useful to them. Domain\nadministrator passwords are of especially high value, as they can help greatly in moving further through the Intranet.\nOften small scripts or even manual commands are used to comb through local files and create network mappings.\nSimple system commands can help the attacker to learn about installed security tools, saved links to internal\n\n\n-----\n\nplatforms and local address books.\nOnce new systems are identified the\nattacker will attempt to hop onto\nthem as well. In some instances\nthey might even use zero-day\nvulnerabilities to spread further into\nthe network.\n\nOne method which is gaining more\nrelevance is the hijacking of local\nsoftware distribution systems for\nfurther distribution. This can either\nbe proprietary systems, such as the\n[case of Trojan.Jokra in South Korea,](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2013-032014-2531-99)\nor OS-specific, such as hijacking\nWindows Update, in the case of\nFlamer. Once the attackers have\nsuccessfully managed to create\nand distribute their own package, _Figure 9: Typical commands used during discovery phase_\nthey can easily infect all connected\nsystems at once. Especially in cases\nof wiping attacks, such Trojan.Jokra, this is a very efficient way to disrupt as many computers as possible.\n\nIf the target is assumed to be in a separated network not connected to the Internet, the malware used might try and\nautonomously infect removable drives, like USB sticks, or project files for PLCs. This could allow the malware to be\nmanually introduced to the destination network, without the knowledge of the carrier, essentially jumping air gaps\ninto isolated networks.\n\nAt the end of the discovery phase the attackers should know the internals of the infected networks and have\nidentified systems with interesting data or with connected industrial control systems.\n\n###### Capture/exfiltration phase\n\nThe capture and exfiltration phases are not always present. If the sole goal of the attackers is to cause a disruption\nthey may directly jump to a destructive payload. However, in most cases information is extracted first, which in turn\nallows the sabotage to be constructed more efficiently at a later phase.\n\nIn this phase the interesting data is gathered and sent back to the attackers. This can be done with different levels of\nsophistication. The simple attacks compress the files and upload them through FTP or through a HTTP POST request\nto a remote drop server. More sophisticated attackers obfuscate the data by XOR-ing it, encrypting it with proper\nasymmetric encryption or embedding it into media files using steganography to hide the data from traffic inspection.\nIn addition to this, the amount of data sent and the timing can be chosen in a smart way. For example, some malware\nsamples will send the data in smaller bursts so as not to swamp the network or generate network spikes that might\nattract attention. Since most employees use laptops, the malware can use location awareness to detect if the\ncompromised computer is outside of the corporate network and send the data once it’s directly connected to the\nInternet, such as from a Wi-Fi hotspot at an airport. This might allow the traffic to bypass perimeter security and\nreceive less scrutiny. In some instances the infected computer might not have a direct connection to the Internet. In\nsuch cases, a previously compromised computer in the DMZ can act as a proxy, forwarding all the collected data.\n\n###### Disruption phase\n\nThis is when any destructive payload is launched. If the attackers are only after information this phase might not\nhappen at all. The targets and the goals for disruption attacks can be very different, there is no such thing as one-\nsize-fits-all for disruption attacks. For example, Stuxnet was tailored to attack a specific uranium enrichment facility\nand would not work against a different target.\n\nIn recent times, wiper Trojans have been popular in attacks against the energy sector. The malware deletes all files\n\n\n-----\n\non a computer and then deletes the master boot record, rendering the computer unusable. This can happen on\nany operating systems and we have seen scripts for different UNIX flavors being used as well. Depending on\nthe disaster recovery plan in place, these computers can be remotely recovered. However, there may still be an\noutage while the computers are being restored.\n\n#### Resources\n\n[1] Marco Cova, Corrado Leita, Olivier Thonnard, Angelos D. Keromytis, and Marc Dacier.
