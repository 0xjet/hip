In a three month span,\nwe have observed over 15,000 HTTP requests from malicious documents, the majority of\nwhich were Microsoft Excel spreadsheets carrying an extension. Based on this increasing\n[trend, we believe that IcedID will emerge as an incarnation of Emotet after its disruption.](https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/world%E2%80%99s-most-dangerous-malware-emotet-disrupted-through-global-action)\n[IcedID has also been recently reported to deploy ransomware operations, moving towards a](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2021/02/melting-unc2198-icedid-to-ransomware-operations.html)\nmalware-as-a-Service (MaaS) model to distribute malware.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Threat Intelligence Analysis\n\nOur in-house threat intelligence systems provide us intelligence on the latest threats, threat\nactors and campaigns through an osquery-based sandbox. The threat research team\nregularly monitors these systems to ensure robust coverage, also ingesting the latest\nintelligence and indicators into our integrated Threat Intelligence provided in the Uptycs\nSecurity Analytics Platform.\n\nFrom January 1, 2021 through March 31, 2021, we identified over 15,000 HTTP requests\nfrom over 4,000 similar malicious documents (see Figure 1).\n\n_[Figure 1: Threat Intelligence system HTTP requests cluster. (Click to see larger version.)](https://f.hubspotusercontent00.net/hubfs/2617658/Blog%20post%20-%20Q1%202021-%20IcedID/IcedID%20-%20Image%201.png)_\n\n93% of these malicious office documents belong to a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet file\ncarrying extensions xls or xlsm (see Figure 2).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2: Malicious document types._\n\nThe Microsoft Excel spreadsheet files (.xlsm, xls) were carrying the names:\n\noverdue\nclaim\ncalculation\ninform\nrefusal\ncomplaint and compensation claim\n\nThese files appeared with randomly appended names like\nClaim_331903057_03292021.xlsm.\n\nThe http request of the malicious documents consisted of a second stage executable file (PE\n\n- EXE/DLL) with a fake extension dat, jpg and gif (see Figure 3).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3: Second stage PE file with fake extensions like dat,gif and jpg._\n\nThe fake extensions were the second stage payload of Qakbot and IcedID malware families.\nQakbot and IcedID are generally distributed via email lures containing malicious office\ndocuments as an attachment. The next stage executables (PE - EXE/DLL) are downloaded\nvia compromised websites with fake extensions.\n\n## Technical Analysis: XLSM files Excel 4.0 Macros\n\nA majority of these Microsoft Excel spreadsheet documents were in xlsm format. One such\nxlsm document that recently hit our in-house osquery-based sandbox was titled,\n“Claim_331903057_03292021.xlsm” (Hash 43226874cd34010fa7c8286974174b5e261677ed0b48ed0632903112f68720a8).\n\nUpon execution, the xlsm file presented a message to enable content to view the message.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4: Message Upon Execution of Claim_331903057_03292021.xlsm. (Click to see\n_larger version.)_\n\nEnabling the content allows the embedded Excel 4 macro formulas to execute. Upon\ninvestigation we identified three interesting techniques used to hinder analysis:\n\n1. Hiding macro formulas in three different sheets\n2. Masking the macro formula using a white font on white background\n3. Shrinking the cell contents and making the original content invisible\n\n_Figure 5: Hidden macro found in Claim_331903057_03292021.xlsm. (Click to see larger_\n_version.)_\n\n\n-----\n\nUpon unmasking the anti-analysis techniques, the Excel 4 macro formula used for\ndownloading the IcedID loader payloads was revealed.\n\n_[Figure 6: Unhidden XLM 4 macros - the IcedID payload URL’s.

These DLL files are executed using - \"rundll32 DllName,\nDllRegisterServer\".\n\nThe IcedID loader then retrieves information about the victim PC and sends it over the C2\nserver in an encoded form, as shown in Figures 7 and 8.\n\n_Figure 7: IcedID loader encoding routine._\n\n\n-----\n\n_[Figure 8: IcedID loader http request headers.

We\nrecommend the following measures for enterprise users and administrators to identify and\nprotect against such attacks:\n\nDeploy a multi-layered and real-time detection solution to label, classify, score and\nprioritizes incidents.\nRegularly monitor the suspicious processes, events, and network traffic spawned on\nthe execution of any suspicious documents arriving from untrusted sources.\nAlways be cautious in opening documents from unknown or untrusted sources.\nKeep systems updated with the latest releases and patches.\n\nCredits: Thanks to our Uptycs Team members [Rohit Bhagat for making enhancements with](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rohit-bhagat-a06880172/)\n[clustering in our threat intelligence portal and Siddharth Sharma for the analysis.](https://in.linkedin.com/in/siddhaarth-sharma)\n\n## IOCs\n\n**Hashes**\n\n7152b279e52e2c6fc0f1cfdafcdccfb45285805de1600d47b28cddac9a1c2bb1\n\n57494b5bbe886b1fa00dc81f3f835be03769ed2d7eddd7833991ef57d2c45a2d\n\n072c80376261caa87677abfb9dfc268ef0ef49e1611c1c554368a3501231ad6e\n\nf13f315f4c463e582676a253e6b1a3f487e4f98c2bc6bb40f072dae005020d9b\n\n0bcf2c56c5d3a2c17d1789ac4f3e22b43279957864f30170183e235fa555b4fc\n\nf151ec5b824c7c7eef1e2178c2701353cdf349ac32db5ba09d17474093f77abf\n\nc29b93cf7a5134d0569d325fce06472e511c9f244781e05f9ec1efab261faa64\n\n7a9f6247087a03c17273a1d44dc996d93035220d8fa01b7c7d6f29e73481397b\n\nac7ffe03290d646f0d6b2b70d72bdf5ddec6ea68518a46a43f6cadb8405d55c1\n\n6962c82ca95e3804e022e42c91f1708f8912a7d798d9baccaaa13bc4a04065d3\n\n62db4784c54b77efaacdc85bd6ef2eabb45dcd5f8eec6b3495047b74304fa004\n\ncc804b05d5af7ba2fb752fee78584d8961261900645cc3ceecadd81c3408914b\n\n27f39954ae5f9a1be4a456ed55dbd4b56194729ebb1f23f66c0bdb08ecdf3a20\n\ncf3bff21932f3b9b0a615aa768b6458880b5bee596567b88fd9bc62949dd9ce1\n\n\n-----\n\na76722baf26a2d18dcee08a70df303b8cc330cddb3acc94719b57dd8c12f02cd\n\nf561cc1cc2e6284a37479f53771fff1bab0af7fcf3257a6900489807d896d00f\n\n51d5f805abac585c1cb686c3b87d1597a8ae66c0a3a83f15a5f3143a1197b8e4\n\n249c42bf328ab7cc321da48fcc9d2ba3ffb8afb160776f961554adf8605f894e\n\nd62bff7ef25d08b4d57333e3b7afd9ef8aba7ecdd5e5c2ccdb6351d3808e3e32\n\n14b50bfa149def72f5dc08d27dfff8bd0204d8b8e28c0757327ea1189414c130\n\n4531a5ed6fb4a6ff8bb556305f2a85dd8e3b6f5100c1188223725d50a75ba61d\n\na1c74b07693b5c505edf3682a1c0703229eff8e71b3d61718b59c06e993df226\n\n**URLs**\n\nmissimokotov[.]space\n\nmetaflip[.]io\n\npartsapp[.]com[.]br\n\nusaaforced[.]fun\n\nagenbolatermurah[.]com\n\ntajushariya[.]com\n\ncolumbia[.]aula-web[.]net\n\nTag(s): [malware,](https://www.uptycs.com/blog/tag/malware) [threat intelligence,](https://www.uptycs.com/blog/tag/threat-intelligence) [threat research](https://www.uptycs.com/blog/tag/threat-research)\n\n## Uptycs Threat Research\n\nResearch and updates from the Uptycs Threat Research team.\n\nConnect with the author\n\n\n-----",
