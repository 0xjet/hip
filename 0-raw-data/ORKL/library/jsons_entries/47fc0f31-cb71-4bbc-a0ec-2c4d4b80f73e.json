While TA542, the actor](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/corporate-blog/post/emotet-leverages-coronavirus-and-greta-thunberg-again-while-coronavirus-threats)\nbehind Emotet, has sent messages to local, state, and other government recipients,\nhistorically they have not directly leveraged political themes in their messaging.\n\nOn October 1, 2020, we observed thousands of Emotet email messages with the\nsubject “Team Blue Take Action” sent to hundreds of organizations in the US. The message\n[body is taken directly from a page on the Democratic National Committee's website, with the](https://democrats.org/team-blue/)\naddition of a line requesting that the recipient open the attached document.\n\nAttached is a malicious Word document, “Team Blue Take Action.” The Word doc contains\nmacros which, if enabled by the intended recipient, will download and install Emotet. The\ncurrent second stage payload we’ve observed following Emotet is Qbot \"partner01\" and The\nTrick \"morXXX\" (e.g., \"mor125\").\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1: ”Team Blue Take Action” lure containing malicious Word doc attachment_\n\nSample of additional related subjects observed includes:\n\nValanters 2020\n\nDetailed information\n\nList of works\n\nVolunteer\n\nInformation\n\nSample of additional related filenames observed includes:\n\nTeam Blue Take Action.doc\n\nList of works.doc\n\nValanters 2020.doc\n\n\n-----\n\nDetailed information.doc\n\nVolunteer.doc\n\n[The shift to using politically themed lures comes days after the first of several 2020 US](https://www.nytimes.com/article/presidential-debate-calendar.html)\nPresidential debates. The debate received widespread media coverage, and as Election Day\ndraws nearer, many voters are likely feeling compelled to volunteer for political causes or for\nthe election in some way. However, it’s unlikely that this shift is driven by any specific political\nideology. Like earlier use of COVID-19 or Greta Thunberg lure themes, TA542 is attempting\nto reach as many intended recipients as possible by capitalizing on a popular topic.\n\n\"Team Blue Take Action.doc\" document SHA256:\n21cda873bff60530ae094d7906219b5c0cc5d98e808f8608962886683fc37504\n\nSubscribe to the Proofpoint Blog\n\n\n-----",
