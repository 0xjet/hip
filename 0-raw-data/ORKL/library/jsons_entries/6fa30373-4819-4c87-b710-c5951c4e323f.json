While DarkSide\nhas folded since the attack, the affiliates that fueled the gang’s successful\nRansomware-as-a-Service operation are likely continuing their activity.\nUsing Maltego and information from Intel 471’s reporting and forum data, we can\nidentify six aliases with connections to DarkSide.\nIdentifying affiliates is critical to fully understanding the ransomware ecosystem and\nthose who contribute to it\n\n\n-----\n\n## About DarkSide Ransomware 🔗\n\nThe attack against Colonial Pipeline represents one of those rare moments where\ncybersecurity crosses over into mainstream news. In early May, Americans and others\n[around the world watched as oil prices in the US spiked, the criminal gang involved](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gas-prices-shortages-worsen-colonial-pipeline-ransomware-attack/)\nscrambled to [distance itself from the appearance of being in the pocket of Russia, and](https://www.wired.com/story/darkside-ransomware-colonial-pipeline-response/) the\nfirm behind one of the US’s largest pipeline systems forked over a multimillion dollar ransom\nto their network’s hijackers.\n\nIn the midst of this, the DarkSide ransomware gang shut down their operations and went\nunderground, seemingly spooked by the high level of scrutiny the group has received. The\ngroup took down its public-facing “name-and-shame” blog and their cryptocurrency wallets\nwere drained.\n\nJust because DarkSide shuttered operations does not mean that those who have worked\nalongside DarkSide are retreating. Many of the most potent ransomware gangs in 2021\noperate using a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) model, where crews behind the\ndevelopment and maintenance of the ransomware partner with freelance cybercriminals in\norder to break into corporate and other high-value networks. These freelancers, typically\nreferred to as “affiliates,” are responsible for the ransomware’s distribution. These affiliates\nare temporary partners of the ransomware gang and may work for several ransomware\ngangs at a given time. Profits from the criminal scheme are divvied up between the gang\nand the affiliate, with the affiliate typically taking a larger share of the proceeds.\n\nFollowing the Colonial Pipeline incident, it appears that the DarkSide gang as we currently\nknow it has, at least for the moment, closed down shop. Many of their affiliates, however,\nare likely to continue operating, reaching out to other ransomware gangs in order to\nmonetize their access.\n\n[Using Maltego and Intel 471 data, we can begin to form a picture of some of the known](https://www.maltego.com/transform-hub/intel-471/)\nDarkSide affiliates.\n\n## Identifying Affiliates Using Intel 471 Reporting 🔗\n\nTo start, we will examine reports authored by Intel 471 that mention DarkSide. We will insert\na phrase Entity and label it “DarkSide.” From there, we will use the Transform [Intel 471]\n**Phrase to Report. This will give us numerous reports that mention “DarkSide.”**\n\nIn order to protect the TTPs employed by Intel 471 researchers, we have obfuscated some\nof the details that appear in this blog. We are hoping that by showing this process, however,\nwe can share what’s possible when Maltego and Intel 471 are used together to power\n\n\n-----\n\ninvestigations.\n\n_Image 1: Intel 471 reports that contain mentions of “DarkSide.”_\n\nThere are many different reports that are returned. For the sake of this investigation, we will\nfocus on the intelligence reports (with the INFOREP label) and delete all the others. We\nnow have 19 intelligence reports:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Image 2: Intelligence reports – labeled “INFOREP” – that contain mentions to DarkSide. We_\n_focus on intelligence reports in order to try to ensure that the data is most relevant to_\n_DarkSide (and not a broader trend report)._\n\nNow we must determine which of these reports are actually related to the DarkSide gang\nand their affiliates. When we view some of the reports directly in Intel 471’s Titan portal, we\nsee that a handful of the reports only mention DarkSide in passing; for instance, one report\nstates that a certain threat actor has “denied using the DarkSide ransomware.”\n\nIn order to work with the content most relevant to DarkSide, we will search for reports that\ncontain the word “DarkSide” in their titles (and not only mentioned in the report body). We\ncan do this by pressing CTRL + F (CMD +F on a mac) to open the finder bar and typing\n“DarkSide”. This will now highlight all the reports, along with our initial phrase Entity, that\ncontain the word “DarkSide” in the report’s title. In order to select the reports that DON’T\nmention DarkSide in the title, we can click on the “Invert Selection” button (beneath\n“Select All” and “Select None” on Maltego’s investigate tab). Let’s delete those nine\nEntities that do not contain the word “DarkSide” in the report’s title. We will also delete one\nadditional report in which DarkSide is mentioned as an alias of a threat actor, and not\nrelated to the ransomware gang.\n\nNote: if your results are a little different here, make sure that your finder search bar is NOT\nsearching for the term “DarkSide” within the properties of the Entities by ensuring that\n“Properties” is unchecked in the finder bar.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Image 3: Results of reports that include the word “DarkSide” in their title._\n\nWe now have nine intelligence reports authored by analysts at Intel 471 that appear to\ndiscuss the DarkSide ransomware gang.\n\n## Extracting Information on Relevant Threat Actors from Intel 471 Reports 🔗\n\nWe have nine intelligence reports that we’ve deduced are mostly likely to be related to the\nransomware gang and their affiliates. We will now run the Transform [Intel 471] Report to\n**Entities. This Transform will return lots of cool data from the reports, including emails,**\ndomains, Bitcoin addresses, and more.\n\n_Image 4: Various interesting Entities are returned to us from the reports; we are just going_\n_to focus on the aliases._\n\n\n-----\n\nFor this moment though, we just want to concentrate on the aliases that are returned. An\nalias here is the username of a threat actor. There are 62 aliases returned, and we want to\ndetermine which among those are the most relevant threat actors. There are multiple ways\nan analyst can approach this problem; in this example, we will see which threat actors are\nmentioned in multiple intelligence reports. We will “Select by Type -> Alias” and click the\n“Add Parents” button. Now we have selected all the aliases, as well as the intelligence\nreports that mention those aliases. We want to copy that information to a new graph.\n\n_Image 5: The light green Entities represent intelligence reports, while the dark green_\n_Entities are aliases mentioned in that report. There are lots of aliases on this graph, so we_\n_must cut through the noise and identify the most relevant._\n\nWe can see several threat actors mentioned across multiple reports, while others are only\nmentioned in one report. We are not as interested in those threat actors who have only\nbeen written about in a single report, as these individuals are likely less important in relation\nto DarkSide. We can remove those from the graph by hitting “Select Leaves” and deleting\nthem. Now we have aliases that have been mentioned in at least two intelligence reports,\nleaving us with eight aliases.\n\n_Image 6: Eight aliases appear in multiple DarkSide-related intelligence reports. The names_\n_of the threat actors who have not been publicly identified are substituted here with the_\n_placeholder “Threat Actor #x.”_\n\nSome of these aliases are associated with DarkSide operators, such as “DarkSide” and\n“darksupp.” The other six aliases, however, likely belong to threat actors closely linked to\nthe group, as they were mentioned in multiple intelligence reports about DarkSide\nransomware. It’s possible that these may be affiliates of the gang.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusion 🔗\n\nWe have identified eight threat actors who appear to be affiliates of the DarkSide\nransomware crew. We can dig into those threat actors more – investigating which forums\nthey are on, who their associates may be, what other ransomware gangs they may have\nbeen affiliated with, and how they might be gaining access to these environments.\n\nWhile it is important to track ransomware gangs, it is also critical that we track RaaS\naffiliates. RaaS affiliates hold an important position in the ransomware ecosystem because\nof their specialization in getting a foothold in the networks of valuable targets. Their roles\nalso allow them to enjoy a lot of flexibility, moving easily between ransomware gangs should\none disappear or even just offer a more lucrative payment structure.\n\nIntel 471 reporting can help us better contextualize who these individuals are, while Intel\n471 forum data can allow us to see what these threat actors are sharing with their\ncybercriminal peers. Maltego allows us to take this trove of data and speed up our ability to\nconduct analysis as we pivot between different types of data. With Intel 471 and Maltego\ntogether, we can quickly identify and subsequently track these affiliates as the move\nbetween gangs and continue their illicit operations.\n\n[Don’t forget to follow us Twitter and](https://www.twitter.com/MaltegoHQ) [LinkedIn and](https://www.linkedin.com/company/maltego) [sign up to our email newsletter to stay](https://www.maltego.com/newsletter-signup/)\nupdated on new use cases, tutorials, and event information!\n\n\n-----",
