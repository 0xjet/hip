In particular, over the last\nyear or two, we have seen an expansion of ‘mainstream’ ransomware even further into the\ndata extortion and theft realm. It is one thing to have files encrypted, but having to treat every\nransomware infection as a breach adds multiple new layers of complexity for victims of these\ncampaigns. This is especially complex with GDPR and similar legal and compliance hurdles\nto now figure in.\n\n[Ransomware families like Maze, CLOP,](https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/maze-ransomware-update-extorting-and-exposing-victims/) [DoppelPaymer, Sekhmet, and](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/yara-hunting-for-code-reuse-doppelpaymer-ransomware-dridex-families/) [Nefilim/Nephilim are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNxEXujw0HM)\nexamples of threats which, upon infection, result in this complex issue for their victims. While\n[Maze, DopplePayer & REvil tend to get the bulk of media coverage, Nephilim is another](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFWbYSDQMco&t=65s)\nfamily which has very quickly risen to prominence with multiple damaging campaigns that\nthreaten to publish victims’ sensitive information in the event they fail to ‘cooperate’ with the\nattacker’s demands.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Overview\n\nNefilim emerged in March 2020 and shares a substantial portion of code with another\nransomware family, NEMTY. The exact relationship between the actors behind NEMTY and\nNefilim/Nephilim is less than clear.\n\nNEMTY launched in August of 2019 as a public affiliate program, and has since gone\nprivate. Current data indicates that rather than the same actors being behind both families, it\nis more likely that those behind Nephilim ‘acquired’ necessary code out of NEMTY in one\nway or another.\n\nThe two primary differences between Nefilim and NEMTY are the payment model, and the\nlack of a RaaS operation. Nefilim instructs victims to contact the attackers via email, as\nopposed to directing them to a TOR-based payment portal. To add even more confusion to\nthe family tree, Nefilim appears to have evolved into ‘Nephilim’, and the two are technically\nsimilar, differentiated primarily by extension and artifacts in encrypted files.\n\nHowever, there is also intelligence indicating that NEMTY has continued and forked into a\nnew ‘NEMTY Revenue’ version. This comes after the actors behind NEMTY announced that\nthey would be taking the threat private (no more publicly accessible RaaS operation).\n\n\n-----\n\nTechnically, Nephilim is not dissimilar from other well-known ransomware families. The\nprimary method of delivery is currently vulnerable RDP services. Once the attackers have\ncompromised the environment via RDP, they then proceed to establish persistence, to locate\nand exfiltrate additional credentials where possible, and then to deliver the ransomware\npayloads to their intended targets.\n\n## Nephilim Encryption Protocols\n\nIn the Nephilim samples we have analyzed the actual file encryption is handled via a tagteam of AES-128 and RSA-2048. Note, the original vendor behind Nefilim/Nephilim\nadvertises it as such as well.\n\nSpecific files are encrypted using AES-128. At that point, an RSA-2048 public key is used to\nencrypt the AES encryption key. The public key is subsequently embedded in the\nransomware executable payloads. This is one area that differs from pure NEMTY, which is\nknown to have used different key lengths. For example, prior versions of NEMTY have used\nRSA-8192 as a “master key” for encryption of target configuration data along with the rest of\nthe keys (src: [Acronis).](https://www.acronis.com/en-us/blog/posts/threat-analysis-nemty-ransomware-and-fake-paypal-site)\n\nWe are also aware of variants of NEMTY that utilize an RSA-1024 public key for processing\nthe AES encryption key. Also, with earlier versions of NEMTY, there was variance across\nhow files of specific size ranges were handled. Later versions of NEMTY (aka NEMTY\n[REVENUE 3.1) utilize AES-128 in counter mode, along with RSA-2048 for encrypting the](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7e2f/3c9060256bd7b0a4749c39cf6032736037f5.pdf)\nAES keys.\n\nAt this time only the actors behind Nephilim are able to decrypt affected files. That is to say,\nthere are no known flaws or methods to bypass the attackers’ safeguards on the encrypted\nfiles.\n\n## Nephilim Post-infection Behavior\n\nAfter infection, encrypted files are given the `.Nefilim or` `.NEPHILIM extension. A`\nsimilarly named ransom note is deposited in directories containing encrypted files.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn some cases, with Nephilim, the ‘NEPHILIM-DECRYPT.txt’ will only be written to\n~AppDataLocalVirtualStore. Location and name of the locally-stored desktop wallpaper\nvaries. In recent Nephilim infections, the alternate desktop image is written to %temp% with\nthe filename ‘god.jpg’.\n\n## Strings, Distinguishing Traits\n\nAnother hallmark of Nephilim is the use of embedded strings and compiler paths to send\n“subtle messages”, primarily to researchers and analysts it would seem. For example, the\nfollowing compiler path can be found in these samples (both compiled on April 7, 2020):\n```\nb8066b7ec376bc5928d78693d236dbf47414571df05f818a43fb5f52136e8f2e\nfcc2921020690a58c60eba35df885e575669e9803212f7791d7e1956f9bf8020\n\n```\nWhile the sample\n```\nd4492a9eb36f87a9b3156b59052ebaf10e264d5d1ce4c015a6b0d205614e58e3\n\n```\nfrom March 2020 contains additional jabs at specific AV vendors.\n\n\n-----\n\n[This sample was also referenced by @malwrhunterteam in a](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam/status/1247495429505323008) [March 13th tweet.](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam/status/1247495429505323008)\n\n## Name & Shame Strategy\n\nNefilim/Nephilim also threatens to publish sensitive information from the infected\nenvironments in the event that the victim refuses to cooperate with the attackers’ demands,\nas evidenced in this typical Nephilim ransom note.\n\n\n-----\n\nAttempting to negotiate, or refusal to pay, fall under the category of non-compliance. To date,\ntwo companies have been published on Nephilim’s “shaming” websites (clearnet and TORbased). It is worth noting that initially, all the companies listed on their site were oil and\nenergy companies. However, between April 23 and April 27, 2020, the group has added\nthree additional victims to the site. One of these is another large oil and gas company, and\nthe other two are classified as “Apparel and Fashion” and “Engineering and Construction\nServices”.\n\nMultiple other familles follow this same practice, which turns “basic” ransomware infections\ninto full (and sometimes catastrophic) data breaches. Other well known families embracing\nthis model are Maze, REvil, DoppelPaymer, CLOP, Sekhmet, and more recently, [Ragnar. We](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ragnarlocker-ransomware-hits-edp-energy-giant-asks-for-10m/)\nnote that Nefilim/Nephilim is also one of the families that has “vowed” not to attack medical\n[entities, nonprofits and other “critical” entities during the current pandemic.](https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/threat-intel-update-cyber-attacks-leveraging-the-covid-19-coronavirus-pandemic/)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nProtecting your environment against threats like Nephilim is more critical than ever. In order\nto prevent loss of data and the consequences of a large-scale data breach, organizations\n[must rely on a modern, well maintained, and properly-tuned and trusted security solution.](https://www.sentinelone.com/platform/)\nPrevention is key with these attacks. Even in the event that the encryption/data-loss can be\nmitigated through decryptors, backups or rollbacks, victims still face the problem of their data\nbeing posted publicly. We encourage our customers to analyze and understand the threats\nand to take swift and appropriate action to prevent incidents occurring in the first place.\n\n[SentinelOne Endpoint Protection detects and prevents malicious actions associated with](https://www.sentinelone.com/platform/)\nNEMTY, Nefilim, and Nephilim.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\nFor convenience, we provide both SHA256 and SHA1 hashes below.\n\n**SHA256**\n8be1c54a1a4d07c84b7454e789a26f04a30ca09933b41475423167e232abea2b\nb8066b7ec376bc5928d78693d236dbf47414571df05f818a43fb5f52136e8f2e\n3080b45bab3f804a297ec6d8f407ae762782fa092164f8ed4e106b1ee7e24953\n7de8ca88e240fb905fc2e8fd5db6c5af82d8e21556f0ae36d055f623128c3377\nb227fa0485e34511627a8a4a7d3f1abb6231517be62d022916273b7a51b80a17\n3bac058dbea51f52ce154fed0325fd835f35c1cd521462ce048b41c9b099e1e5\n353ee5805bc5c7a98fb5d522b15743055484dc47144535628d102a4098532cd5\n5ab834f599c6ad35fcd0a168d93c52c399c6de7d1c20f33e25cb1fdb25aec9c6\n52e25bdd600695cfed0d4ee3aca4f121bfebf0de889593e6ba06282845cf39ea\n35a0bced28fd345f3ebfb37b6f9a20cc3ab36ab168e079498f3adb25b41e156f\n7a73032ece59af3316c4a64490344ee111e4cb06aaf00b4a96c10adfdd655599\n08c7dfde13ade4b13350ae290616d7c2f4a87cbeac9a3886e90a175ee40fb641\n\n\n-----\n\nD4492a9eb36f87a9b3156b59052ebaf10e264d5d1ce4c015a6b0d205614e58e3\nB8066b7ec376bc5928d78693d236dbf47414571df05f818a43fb5f52136e8f2e\nfcc2921020690a58c60eba35df885e575669e9803212f7791d7e1956f9bf8020\n\n**SHA1**\n4595cdd47b63a4ae256ed22590311f388bc7a2d8\n1f594456d88591d3a88e1cdd4e93c6c4e59b746c\n6c9ae388fa5d723a458de0d2bea3eb63bc921af7\n9770fb41be1af0e8c9e1a69b8f92f2a3a5ca9b1a\ne99460b4e8759909d3bd4e385d7e3f9b67aa1242\ne53d4b589f5c5ef6afd23299550f70c69bc2fe1c\nc61f2cdb0faf31120e33e023b7b923b01bc97fbf\n0d339d08a546591aab246f3cf799f3e2aaee3889\nbbcb2354ef001f476025635741a6caa00818cbe7\n2483dc7273b8004ecc0403fbb25d8972470c4ee4\nd87847810db8af546698e47653452dcd089c113e\nE94089137a41fd95c790f88cc9b57c2b4d5625ba\nBd59d7c734ca2f9cbaf7f12bc851f7dce94955d4\nf246984193c927414e543d936d1fb643a2dff77b\nd87847810db8af546698e47653452dcd089c113e\n\n\n-----",
