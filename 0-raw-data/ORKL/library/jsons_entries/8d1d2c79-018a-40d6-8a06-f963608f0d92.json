Ash was popular too.\nStretching back to April 2016, she'd befriended a lot of individuals, as many as 500, with\nsimilar interests. Her looks almost certainly helped her apparent popularity.\n\nAsh was thrown off of Facebook earlier this year, though. Not for any obvious infraction. But\nbecause Facebook had been handed proof by SecureWorks researcher Allison Wikoff that\n[convinced them Ash was a fake. Not only that, her persona has been tied by Wikoff to one of](https://www.secureworks.com/research/the-curious-case-of-mia-ash)\n\n\n-----\n\nIran s busiest cyberespionage groups, known as OilRig.\n\nAlongside profiles across LinkedIn and DeviantArt, Ash was one of the most developed fakes\nWikoff had ever seen in her years researching spy activity on the web. “What we’ve seen in\nthe past is just a fake LinkedIn profile, but this had LinkedIn, Facebook, a Blogger profile, two\ndomains, two email addresses, and WhatsApp. Traditionally we haven’t seen across the\nboard,\" Wikoff told Forbes.\n\nAccording to the researcher, Ash was active shortly after a surge in hacker activity from\nOilRig in December, as [previously reported by Forbes. Using stolen images of a real young](https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2017/02/15/oilrig-iran-hackers-cyberespionage-us-turkey-saudi-arabia/)\nwoman from Romania, Ash reached out to an employee of a targeted organization in the\nMiddle East, the name of which SecureWorks isn’t reporting, sharing an interest in\nphotography, shifting initial contact from her LinkedIn profile with more than 500 connections\nto her Facebook account. A relationship, albeit a fake one, was established, with chats over\nWhatsApp too. (Forbes and SecureWorks have attempted to contact the woman whose\nimages were used, but with no success).\n\nEventually, she sent an email to the unwitting target, containing an Excel file, a supposed\nsurvey to do with photography. She asked him to open it on his corporate network, which he\ndid. Then OilRig’s signature malware, known as PupyRAT, attempted to run and steal\npasswords for the corporate network. Fortunately, in that case, the security products of the\norganization sprung into action and prevented any data loss.\n\nDespite the failure of the attack, Ash provides proof that OilRig has become adept at creating\nfake online personas. Wikoff says Ash tried and in many cases succeeded in grooming a\nrange of technical individuals working for Middle East and Africa, most working in the oil and\ngas field. She was convincing enough to befriend an oil and gas cybersecurity pro with 10\nyears experience, according to Wikoff.\n\n**Fake news from Iran?**\n\nBut Ash was one of a large number of fake profiles developed by Iranian-linked hacker\ngroups over recent years, as they hone their craft. In recent months they've been\nexperimenting with fake news outlets too. A separate group believed to be of Iranian origin,\nknown as Charming Kitten, set up the blandly-named BritishNews, spamming a significant\namount of content earlier this year, up to a sudden stop in April, according to a report handed\nto Forbes by Israeli security firm ClearSky.\n\nThe fake agency used stolen content from across the web and was designed to draw in\ntargets to visit the official BritishNews website, from where malware would be delivered. The\nfake agency had a fake employee too. Again, LinkedIn was key to creating the persona,\nthough it's unclear just who Charming Kitten was trying to target with BritishNews.\n\nThe only employee of the fake BritishNews agency, according to ClearSky.\n\n\n-----\n\nClearSky\n\nClearSky also reported on another fake profile earlier this week, believed to have been\nestablished by yet another Iranian-linked hacker crew called CopyKitten. Back in 2013, the\ncrew had set up a handful of Facebook profiles to spread links to a copy of Israeli news site\nHaaretz. One Facebook fraud, named Amanda Morgan, was still active up to this month and\nwas also promoting a fake news service called Emet Press. No malware were delivered over\nthe sites and ClearSky believes they were only set up to establish trust. Most have now had\ntheir social sites cut down, others simply remain dormant, said ClearSky head of intelligence\nEyal Sela.\n\nIran's use of personas isn't new. Historically, Iran's defense and intelligence units have long\n[been linked to social media-led campaigns. The Newscaster attacks of 2014, for instance,](http://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/iranian-cyberspies-pose-as-journalists-online-to-ensnare-their-targets/d/d-id/1269270)\nsaw myriad LinkedIn personas set up profiles posing as journalists. It's only the quality of the\nfakes that's increasing.\n\n**Facebook response**\n\nFor its part Facebook has been responsive to requests to remove fake profiles. Alex Stamos,\nchief security officer for Facebook, told Forbes the company would be taking more of a\nmanual approach rather than relying on automated technologies for dealing with nation statesponsored fakes.\n\n\"A lot of that work ... is more about looking for the patterns of malicious behavior that are\nexpressed by those kinds of grooming attacks by advanced nation state adversaries,\"\nStamos said. \"That would be more of a manual process that's helped by automation.\"\n\nWith Iran not giving up on its social exploitation, expect that game of whack-a-mole to\ncontinue.\n\n[Follow me on Twitter.
