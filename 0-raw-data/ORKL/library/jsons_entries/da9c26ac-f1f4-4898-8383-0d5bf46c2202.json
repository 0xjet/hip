Part 2\n\n**securelist.com/i-am-hdroot-part-2/72356/**\n\nAuthors\n\n[Dmitry Tarakanov](https://securelist.com/author/dmitryt/)\n\nSome time ago while tracking Winnti group activity we came across a suspicious 64-bit\nsample. It was a standalone utility with the name HDD Rootkit for planting a bootkit on a\ncomputer. Once installed the bootkit infects the operating system with a backdoor at the early\nbooting stage. The principles of this bootkit’s work, named HDRoot, have been described in\nthe first part of our article. During our investigation we found several backdoors that the\nHDRoot bootkit used for infecting operating systems. These backdoors are described in this\npart of the article.\n\n## Backdoors\n\nSince the backdoor installed with the use of HDRoot might be arbitrary, we can’t describe\nwhat malware is run by HDRoot bootkit in every case where it might be found. But at least\nwe have managed to collect two types of malware that were identified while tracking\nHDRoot. The first one was extracted manually from the hard drives of victims where HDRoot\nwas detected and who contacted us for the help with combating the infection. Another one\nwas found in a standalone dropper that contained both HDRoot and the installed backdoor.\n\n### 1st type backdoor\n\n\n-----\n\n**MD5** **Size** **Linker** **Compiled on**\n\n**C0118C58B6CD012467B3E35F7D7006ED** 113’152 10.00 2012-12-19 17:14:21\n\n**Property** **Value**\n\nFileVersion 6.1.7601.17514 (win7sp1_rtm.101119-1850)\n\nFileDescription ProfSvc\n\nInternalName ProfSvc\n\nOriginalFilename ProfSvc.dll\n\nLegalCopyright © Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.\n\nProductName Microsoft Windows Operating System® ®\n\nCompanyName Microsoft Corporation\n\nThis is the malware family known as server-side Derusbi, which we observed during several\nWinnti-related incidents. Usually this is a DLL with the internal name OfficeUt32.dll and\nexported functions like:\n\n_DllRegisterServer_\n\n_DllUnregisterServer_\n\n_ServiceMain_\n\n_SvchostPushServiceGlobals_\n\n_WUServiceMain_\n\n___crt_debugger_hook_\n\nThis list of functions can differ slightly from version to version. The main DLL includes other\nmalware components in its body, usually maintained in the XOR-ciphered form:\n\n\n-----\n\n_The structure for maintaining additional modules_\n\nThe Derusbi samples installed with the use of the HDRoot bootkit contained a Remote Shell\nmodule and network driver.\n\nThe installation routine is implemented in the exported function “DllRegisterServer“. When\ncalled, this function performs the following actions:\n\nIt copies itself to the folder “%System32%wbem“, with a name consisting of “ntfs” +\nthree random letters, and a “.mof” extension, for example “ntfsqwe.mof“, and sets the\nyear to 2005 in the date attributes of the file.\nIt puts a string with its own path to the “ServiceDll” value in the registry that associates\nwith the “iphlpsvc” or “wuauserv” system service depending on Windows version, and\nsaves the original value of “ServiceDll” in encrypted form to the “Security” parameter of\nthe same registry key. It executes the malware on system startup.\nAfter the malware service has started, it starts the original system service that was\nreplaced, running the dynamic link library associated with the service specified in the\n“Security” parameter during malware installation.\n\nThe malware stores its configuration data in encrypted form in the “Security” value of the\n_HKLMSOFTWAREMicrosoftRpc registry key. It contains a unique computer identifier, and the_\nsignature for matching incoming C&C server packets.\n\nThe malware can either connect to the C&C server directly if it is specified in the settings\nblock in its body or work in listening mode if no C&C server is defined. The samples related\nto the HDRoot bootkit we found worked in listening mode.\n\n### 1st type backdoor: the driver\n\n\n-----\n\n**MD5** **Size** **Linker** **Compiled on**\n\n**C8DAF9821EBC4F1923D6DDB5477A8BBD** 37’264 9.00 2012-12-19 17:08:53\n\n**Property** **Value**\n\nFileVersion 6.1.7601.17514 (win7sp1_rtm.101119-1850)\n\nFileDescription Partition Management Driver\n\nInternalName partmgr.sys\n\nOriginalFilename partmgr.sys\n\nLegalCopyright © Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.\n\nProductName Microsoft Windows Operating System® ®\n\nCompanyName Microsoft Corporation\n\n(The driver was signed on December 19, 2012 17:11:14 with the stolen certificate of South\nKorean online gaming company XL Games. The certificate was revoked on Jun 21, 2013. Its\nserial number is: 7b:d5:58:18:c5:97:1b:63:dc:45:cf:57:cb:eb:95:0b).\n\nThe main malware DLL decrypts, drops and runs the rootkit as a file\n_“%System32%DriversLst_Update.sys”. The driver at the very beginning of the process_\nremoves all registry values created during its launch and the actual driver file. The rootkit\nconceals malicious network activity from popular network monitoring tools by hooking the\n_IRP_MJ_DIRECTORY_CONTROL service routine of “DeviceTcp” or “Drivernsiproxy” system_\nobjects. It also hides the file “windowssystem32wiarpc.dll” from user-mode applications by\nhooking the IRP_MJ_DIRECTORY_CONTROL service routine of the file system driver\n_“FileSystemNtfs”._\n\nIf the malware works in listening mode, the rootkit is also engaged in the communication\nroutines. It sniffs all incoming network packets and searches them for a specially crafted\nsignature. If found, it redirects these packets to the listening socket opened by the main\nmalware module. The main module creates a network socket on a random port on all\nnetwork interfaces. If the rootkit pushes a network packet that matches the predefined\nsignature, the main malware module will process it. This network packet includes command\ncode and the module ID that has to perform that command. Known versions of the malware\nrecognize five modules with different commands:\n\n\n**Module**\n**ID**\n\n\n**Supported commands**\n\n\n-----\n\n0x80 Services management: list of services, creating, starting, stopping, deleting\nservices\n\nManage running processes: terminating, retrieving module file name, processes\ntoken\n\nRegistry management\n\n0x81 Execution of arbitrary files or shell commands on infected system\n\n0x82 Traffic redirection via port forwarding: infected host is used as proxy\n\n0x84 Browsing the file system, uploading/downloading files\n\n0x240 Main module control: removing the main module, stopping the main module,\ndownloading and starting DLL from the remote server (this DLL will be saved in\n_%TEMP% as “tmp1.dat”), starting network proxy_\n\n### 1st type backdoor: remote shell library\n\n**MD5** **Size** **Linker** **Compiled on**\n\n**1C30032DC5435070466B9DC96F466F95** 13’360 10.00 2012-12-19 17:12:12\n\n**Property** **Value**\n\nProductVersion 6.1.2600.1569\n\nProductName Microsoft Windows Operating System® ®\n\nCompanyName Microsoft Corporation\n\nFileDescription Microsoft update\n\nFileVersion 6.1.2600.1569\n\nAs was mentioned earlier, besides a network driver there was only one additional module\nincluded in the discovered versions of the Dersubi samples related to HDRoot – Remote\nShell. The main malware module decrypts, drops and runs it as the file\n_“%Systemroot%Helpperfc009.dat”. This is the DLL with the internal name Office.dll and one_\nexported function R32. The library is run by executing the following command line:\n\n_rundll32.exe %Systemroot%Helpperfc009.dat R32 <random_number>_\n\nwhere <random_number> is a pre-shared value generated by the main module.\n\nThe Remote Shell library creates two named pipes used to communicate with the main\nmodule:\n\n\n-----\n\n_pipeusb<random_number>i_\n_pipeusb<random_number>o_\n\nThe command line from the operator for execution is expected to come through the pipe\n_pipeusb<random_number>o. When this command comes a new process is created to_\nexecute it in the working directory %SystemDrive%. Standard input of the process that has\njust been created is set to be obtained from the pipe pipeusb<random_number>o, while\noutput and STDERR are redirected into the parallel pipe pipeusb<rando_number>i. This\nmeans input to the executing program comes from an operator and the program’s output\ngoes back to him, framing an effective backdoor channel.\n\n### 2nd type backdoor: the dropper\n\n**MD5** **Size** **Linker** **Compiled on**\n\n**755351395AA920BC212DBF1D990809AB** 266’240 6.00 2013-11-18 19:23:12\n\nWe were able to spot a sample that turned out to be a one-click installer of the backdoor with\nthe use of HDRoot. This is a Win32 executable compiled on 18 November 2013 according to\nits data stamp in the header. The executable includes resources “102” and “103” of custom\ntype “MHM”. These are the executable of HDRoot installer and the installed backdoor.\n\nThe role of the installed backdoor is played by the executable maintained as the resource\n_“102” and dropped as the file %windir%bootmgr.exe. (Running a few steps forward we have_\nto say that formally it’s not a backdoor but a downloader.) The tool “HDD Rootkit” which is the\nresource “103” is dropped as %windir%hall32.exe. Then the dropper runs the following\ncommand line:\n\n_%windir%hall32.exe inst %windir%bootmgr.exe c:_\n\nthat instructs the HDRoot installer named hall32.exe to install the HDRoot bootkit onto the\nhard drive where disk C: is located with subsequent running of the downloader bootmgr.exe\non system start-up.\n\nThere are other files specified in the dropper’s body that it checks for in the file system or\nwhich the malware uses in intermediate procedures:\n\n_%windir%system32midimapbits.dll_\n\n_%windir%system32mpeg4c32.dll_\n\n_%windir%bootmgr.dat_\n\n## The downloader\n\n**MD5** **Size** **Linker** **Compiled on**\n\n\n-----\n\n**11E461ED6250B50AFB70FBEE93320131** 69’632 6.00 2013-11-18 19:22:30\n\nThe downloader bootmgr.exe was also compiled on 18 November 2013 like the dropper.\nAccording to the list specified in its body, it downloads files by following URLs and runs them:\n\n_http://www.gbutterfly.com/bbs/data/boot1.gif_\n\n_http://www.btdot.com/bbs/data/boot1.gif_\n\n_http://boot.ncook.net/bbs/data/boot1.gif_\n\n_http://www.funzone.co.kr/bbs/data/boot1.gif_\n\n_http://www.srsr.co.kr/bbs2/data/boot1.gif_\n\nIf anything is available via these URLs, it is dropped onto the disk with one of the following\nfile names and run:\n\n_%windir%v3update000.exe_\n\n_%windir%v3update001.exe_\n\n_%windir%v3update002.exe_\n\nThe downloader checks the size of the dropped file and only runs it if it is greater than 20896\nbytes.\n\nIt turned out that this is a double downloader: it maintains another sample with downloading\nfunctionality in its body. The malware drops it with the file name %windir%svchost.exe and\nsubsequently runs it with the parameter “install”. For some reason, immediately after running\nthe 2nd downloader the malware stops the work of the Internet Connection Sharing service\nwith the command line:\n\n_cmd.exe /c net stop sharedaccess_\n\nThere are other files specified in the downloader’s body that it checks for in the file system:\n\n_%windir%system32midimapbits.dll_\n\n_%windir%system32mpeg4c32.dll_\n\n_%windir%winurl.dat_\n\n## The 2nd downloader\n\n**MD5** **Size** **Linker** **Compiled on**\n\n**ACC4D57A98256DFAA5E2B7792948AAAE** 22’016 6.00 2013-11-18 19:06:32\n\nThis malware is able to recognize two parameters: “install” and “remove”. In the installation\nbranch it creates the auto-starting “Winlogon” service with the description “Provides\n_automatic configuration for the 802.11 adapters” and adjusted to run its own executable. The_\n\n\n-----\n\n_remove parameter obviously leads to the deleting of this service._\n\nWhile running, the service decrypts the list of URLs included in its body and tries to\ndownload the content by addresses formed by appending “default.gif” to the URLs from the\nlist. This is a complete decrypted list of URLs:\n\n_http://www.netmarble.net/_\n_http://www.nexon.com/_\n_http://www.tistory.com/start/_\n_http://m.ahnlab.com/_\n_http://www.joinsmsn.com/_\n_http://fcst.co.kr/board/data/media/_\n_http://www.hangame.com/_\n_http://www.msn.com/_\n_http://adw.naver.com/_\n_http://www1.designrg.com/_\n_http://www.topani.com/_\n_http://www.nate.com/_\n_http://www.v3lite.com/_\n_http://www1.webschool.or.kr/_\n_http://snsdate.gndot.com/_\n_http://www.srsr.co.kr/bbs2/data/_\n_http://funzone.co.kr/bbs/data/_\n_http://www.moreuc.com/_\n_http://www1.ncook.net/_\n\nAs you can see, this list includes sites of legitimate and trusted parties and they are unlikely\nto maintain malware components. Because every site is generally not malicious, some of\nthem were probably compromised, or else the malware would not have been functional.\n\nThe content is downloaded into the file %windir%image.jpg. But this is only an intermediate\nstage. It should be a text file that is parsed by the malware. The first line of that file should\ncontain only numbers greater than 139; if not, the malware skips processing that content.\nThe second line is for the URL the malware should use to download an executable and the\nthird line specifies the file name for the downloaded executable that is dropped into the file\nsystem. After downloading the malware restores 2 bytes “MZ” at the very beginning of the\ndropped file and runs it.\n\nAt the same time as it is downloading, the malware tries to remove specific antivirus\nsoftware. On finding an uninstall command line in the registry the malware runs it and by\nmanipulating the user interface buttons of the application it tries to remove three AV\nproducts: AhnLab’s V3 Lite, AhnLab’s V3 365 Clinic and ESTsoft’s ALYac. Although there is a\n\n\n-----\n\nprocess for those products only, the malware also includes inactive functions to disable\nNaver Vaccine and McAfee Security Center. The origin of those vendors clearly suggests\nthat the malware was intended for targets in South Korea.\n\nSince the malware is already quite old we have not been able to download any relevant\nmaterial from the URLs specified both in the 1st and 2nd downloaders. Servers have been\nresponding with nothing or pages stating the absence of content.\n\n## Earlier discovery\n\nWe were not actually the first AV company to encounter HDRoot malware face to face. At the\n[end of 2013 South Korean AhnLab issued a comprehensive report on the ETSO Hacking](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2015/10/20081758/1401223631603288.pdf)\ngroup based on incident response cases their digital forensic team was working on. ETSO\nmalware, according to AhnLab’s classification, mostly corresponds to Winnti malware as we\ndetect it. During their analysis AhnLab’s engineers discovered infected MBRs that, according\nto their description (pages 14-15, chapter “2.5 Maintain Network Presence”), sound like the\nresult of an HDRoot bootkit installer at work:\n\n_[AhnLab’s HDRoot scheme of work](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2015/10/20081806/1401223631603288-1.pdf)_\n\nAlso, we know about incident handlers not necessarily from AV companies that are\nacquainted with the HDD Rootkit utility. However, when it comes to detection, despite the fact\nthat this dangerous threat is quite old, antivirus products were not that good at detecting it.\n\n## Statistics\n\n\n-----\n\nAs expected, HDRoot infections prevail in Winnti s traditional region of primary interest –\nSouth East Asia, especially South Korea, according to KSN. But other parts of the world\nhave also been affected and the extent and impact of this threat may be significant.\n\n_HDRoot-related malware hits_\n\nIt’s important to point out that the numbers don’t represent the nature of the targets. It means\nthat by simply looking at the numbers we can’t see what sort of companies were attacked.\nHence, the map may present a different story from the reality in terms of probable damage\nfor a particular country.\n\nFor example, we were involved in mitigating an HDRoot infection in two major companies in\nRussia and the UK where the malware was discovered on multiple servers with the use of\nour products. In both cases, the damage due to infection could be very significant, especially\nin Russia where many of the company’s customers could have been affected. However, on\nthe map Russia is shown as having suffered just a single hit, while the UK has 23 attacked\nsystems.\n\nAlthough we have not found many malware families installed using HDRoot, and attribute\nknown HDRoot-related activity to Winnti, we continue to assume that this bootkit may be\nused in multiple APT. We already know about an overlap in Winnti activity and other APT\nfrom previous incidents. Taking into account the HDRoot installer’s nature as a standalone\ntool, it’s very possible that this bootkit could be in the hands of other threat actors.\n\nWe detect HDRoot malware with following verdicts:\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Hacktool.Win32.HDRoot_**\n**_Hacktool.Win64.HDRoot_**\n**_Rootkit.Win32.HDRoot_**\n**_Rootkit.Win64.HDRoot_**\n**_Trojan.Boot.HDRoot_**\n\nBackdoors and downloaders related to HDRoot bootkit:\n\n**_Backdoor.Win64.Winnti_**\n**_Trojan.Win32.Agentb.aemr_**\n**_Trojan.Win32.Genome.amvgd_**\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n### Samples hashes\n\n_2c85404fe7d1891fd41fcee4c92ad305_\n\n_4dc2fc6ad7d9ed9fcf13d914660764cd_\n\n_8062cbccb2895fb9215b3423cdefa396_\n\n_c7fee0e094ee43f22882fb141c089cea_\n\n_d0cb0eb5588eb3b14c9b9a3fa7551c28_\n\n_a28fe3387ea5352b8c26de6b56ec88f0_\n\n_2b081914293f415e6c8bc9c2172f7e2a_\n\n_6ac4db5dcb874da2f61550dc950d08ff_\n\n_6ae7a087ef4185296c377b4eadf956a4_\n\n_e171d9e3fcb2eeccdc841cca9ef53fb8_\n\n_ae7f93325ca8b1965502b18059f6e46a_\n\n_e07b5de475bbd11aab0719f9b5ba5654_\n\n_d200f9a9d2b7a44d20c31edb4384e62f_\n\n_cc7af071098d3c00fdd725457ab00b65_\n\n_c0118c58b6cd012467b3e35f7d7006ed_\n\n_c8daf9821ebc4f1923d6ddb5477a8bbd_\n\n_755351395aa920bc212dbf1d990809ab_\n\n_11e461ed6250b50afb70fbee93320131_\n\n_acc4d57a98256dfaa5e2b7792948aaae_\n\n_1c30032dc5435070466b9dc96f466f95_\n\n_7d1309ce050f32581b60841f82fc3399_\n\n_b10908408b153ce9fb34c2f0164b6a85_\n\n_eb3fbfc79a37441590d9509b085aaaca_\n\n_3ad35274cf09a24c4ec44d547f1673e7_\n\n_f6004cfaa6dc53fd5bf32f7069f60e7a_\n\n_c5d59acb616dc8bac47b0ebd0244f686_\n\n_e19793ff58c04c2d439707ac65703410_\n\n\n-----\n\n_4dc2fc6ad7d9ed9fcf13d914660764cd_\n_8062cbccb2895fb9215b3423cdefa396_\n_c7fee0e094ee43f22882fb141c089cea_\n_d0cb0eb5588eb3b14c9b9a3fa7551c28_\n\n### Files\n\n_%windir%twain.dll_\n\n_%windir%systemolesvr.dll_\n\n_%windir%msvidc32.dll_\n\n_%windir%helpaccess.hlp_\n\n_%windir%syswow64C_932.NLS_\n\n_%windir%syswow64C_20949.NLS_\n\n_%windir%syswow64irclass.dll_\n\n_%windir%syswow64msvidc32.dll_\n\n_%windir%syswow64kmddsp.tsp_\n\n_%windir%tempsvchost.exe_\n\n_%System32%wbemntfs<3 random chars>.mof_\n\n_%System32%DriversLst_Update.sys_\n\n_%Systemroot%Helpperfc009.dat_\n\n_%windir%bootmgr.exe_\n\n_%windir%hall32.exe_\n\n_%windir%system32midimapbits.dll_\n\n_%windir%system32mpeg4c32.dll_\n\n_%windir%bootmgr.dat_\n\n_%windir%v3update000.exe_\n\n_%windir%v3update001.exe_\n\n_%windir%v3update002.exe_\n\n_%windir%svchost.exe_\n\n_%windir%winurl.dat_\n\n_%windir%image.jpg_\n\n[APT](https://securelist.com/tag/apt/)\n[Bootkit](https://securelist.com/tag/bootkit/)\n[Cyber espionage](https://securelist.com/tag/cyber-espionage/)\n[Digital Certificates](https://securelist.com/tag/digital-certificates/)\n[HDRoot](https://securelist.com/tag/hdroot/)\n[Malware](https://securelist.com/tag/malware/)\n[Malware Descriptions](https://securelist.com/tag/malware-descriptions/)\n[Rootkits](https://securelist.com/tag/rootkits/)\n[Targeted attacks](https://securelist.com/tag/targeted-attacks/)\n[Winnti](https://securelist.com/tag/winnti/)\n\n\n-----\n\nAuthors\n\n[Dmitry Tarakanov](https://securelist.com/author/dmitryt/)\n\nI am HDRoot!
