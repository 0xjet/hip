    "plain_text": "# Bold ad campaign\n\n**blog.group-ib.com/awc**\n\n06.08.2021\n\nAWC joins illicit carding business by offering 1 Mln compromised cards for free\n\nSergey Kokurin\n\nUnderground Markets Analyst Group-IB\n\nOn August 2, Group-IB Threat Intelligence & Attribution system detected an unconventional\npost on several carding forums. A user, nicknamed AW_cards posted links to a file\ncontaining 1 million pieces of stolen payment records. The file offered for free contained\n\n\n-----\n\ncompromised card details from over 1 000 banks in more than 100 countries, including India,\nMexico, the US, Australia, Brazil, and etc.\n\nThe post immediately sparked Group-IB researchers' interest, because cybercriminals in the\ncarding community rarely offer so many cards for free. It's especially unusual for a previously\nunknown market player. The analysis of the file revealed that this huge batch of\ncompromised cards had not appeared on other underground forums.\n\nFurther research revealed that the post was nothing but a very bold ad to scale up the user\nbase of newly established card shop All World Cards, which joined the carding market in May\n2021. Group-IB researchers found out that the alleged owners of the card shop had\nlaunched a massive promo campaign in the underground to advertise their new platform,\nwhich, in addition to a huge database giveaway, included a writing contest for other\ncybercriminals with a cash prize of USD 15,000.\n\nThis post analyzes the latest 1 mln stolen bank card record database as well as the short\nhistory of the All World Cards card shop and the activity of its alleged owners who are most\nlikely not the newbies of the carding business.\n\n**\"An extraordinary act of generosity\"**\n\nOn August 2, 2021, the same message was posted on two carding forums \"crdclub\" and\n\"xss.\" The user nicknamed \"AW_cards\" in what they called \"An extraordinary act of\ngenerosity\" uploaded a database containing 1 million payment records, some of which\nincluded email addresses and phone numbers.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1 - Screenshot from xss forum (AW_cards: We publish 1,000,000 bank cards to the\npublic. Valid at 3%. All material from 2018-2019. Promotion of unprecedented generosity\nfrom the AllWorld.Cards store) Source: Group-IB Threat Intelligence & Attribution system\n\nFigure 2 - Screenshot from Group-IB Threat Intelligence & Attribution system\n\nIt is noteworthy that a day after the publication, the post was edited. The \"Valid parameter\"\n(which stands for the share of valid bank cards that cybercriminals can monetize) was\nincreased from 3% to 20% of cards in the entire batch.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3 - Screenshot from \"xss\" forum\n\nFigure 4 - Screenshot from \"xss\" forum (Xss forum user: \"With only 3% validity, are these\nССs generated?\")\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5 - Screenshot from Group-IB Threat Intelligence & Attribution system\n\nNevertheless, according to Group-IB's findings, despite the post author's claim that the cards\nwere compromised from 2018-2019, 97% of the records in the database are still valid. In the\nentire batch Group-IB researchers found 810 expired cards, 30 of them expired in June\n2021, 780 in July 2021. At least 27,112 cards are set to expire in August 2021. It can be\nassumed that most of the invalid cards have been removed from the database, or it is newer\nthan declared by the author of the post.\n\nGroup-IB researchers established that the database's owner used several file sharing\nservices to upload it. The database was contained in a password-protected zip archive with a\ntext file containing 1 million lines with the following lines:\n\nCard number;\nExpiration date;\nCVV / CVC code;\nName of the card holder;\nCountry;\nState;\nCity;\nThe address;\nZip code;\nEmail and phone for some entries\n\nHowever, not all of the above fields were available for every record in the database.\n\nAccording to Group-IB's Threat Intelligence team, more than 200,000 (22%) of compromised\npayment cards were from the Indian banks, followed by Mexican (9%), US (9%), and\nAustralian (8%) financial institutions. The distribution of cards in the batch by the country of\nthe issuing bank is shown on Figure 6 below.\n\nGroup-IB continues the outreach campaign to inform the affected financial organizations so\nthat they can take the necessary steps to mitigate potential impact of the compromised data.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6 - Graph of compromised bank card data distribution by country\n\nAccording to the findings, 77% of the cards in the batch were debit cards, 23% were credit\ncards, and the rest accounted for less than 1 percent.\n\nFigure 7 - Graph of compromised bank card data distribution by type\n\nThe distribution of compromised bank card data by the payment systems is roughly the\nsame: Visa cards accounted for 48%, while Mastercard cards stood at 47%. At least 4%\n(more than 39 000 cards) belonged to \"RuPay\" — the national payment system of India\n\n\n-----\n\nAnother 1% of the cards belonged to American Express, the rest of the systems accounted\nfor less than a percent. At least 58% of records in the batch are \"standard\" or \"classic\" cards,\n7% more are \"gold\" and 6% are \"platinum\" cards. It is interesting to note that 8,050 cards\nhave a \"corporate\" postscript.\n\nFigure 8 - Graph of compromised banks card data distribution by payment system\n\nMore than 600,000 lines with a correctly filled email address have been discovered. Among\nthem, email addresses with the domain names of government organizations and banks were\nfound.\n\nSome of the compromised bank card records had IP addresses mentioned for them. Thus, at\nleast 26,451 cards had IP addresses, but only 24,443 of them were unique.\n\nA total of 77 cards from the entire list do not correspond to the Luhn algorithm (the algorithm\nfor checking if the number on a plastic card is correct).\n\nJudging by the analysis of Group-IB TI&A, less than 2% of the cards from the database\noverlap with the bank card data previously offered for sale on any underground resources,\n[including cards from recent Swarmshop and BriansClub leaks. It should be also noted that](https://blog.group-ib.com/swarmshop)\n[some of the cards are related to malicious campaigns involving CoffeMokko JS-sniffers and](https://blog.group-ib.com/coffemokko)\nother similar groups. But in any case, such a small percentage only suggests that the cards\nposted in this database were not previously published on other public sources.\n\nFurther analysis of the activity of the user kicknamed \"AW_cards\" revealed that they are the\nauthor of the newly established All World Cards card shop.\n\n**All World Cards**\n\n\n-----\n\nFor the entire observation period, 3.8 million bank cards were offered for sale in this card\nshop. At least 2.6 million out of them are available for purchase at time of the publication.\n\nIt can be assumed that 1 mln cards offered for free were previously placed on the card shop\nitself. For a new card shop, this amount of sales in 2 months is too high.\n\nFigure 9 - \"All World Cards\" card shop login page\n\n\"All World Cards\" is an underground credit card data marketplace. The first appearance of\nthis card shop on the forums was recorded on May 31, 2021.\n\nFigure 10 -Screenshot from \"xss\" forum (AW_cards: \"Dear users, we present the All World\n_Cards bank cardshop\")._\n\nIt was a message promoting the opening of the card shop.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe card shop s owners are active on several forums using two nicknames AW_cards and\n\"AW_support.\" From these two accounts, they post news about card database updates and\nanswer users' questions.\n\nFigure 11 - Screenshot from \"crdclub\" forum\n\nThe card shop's owners are very active in advertising their forum. For 2 months, more than\n400 messages were posted from both accounts.\n\nOn August 2, 2021, a message about the recruitment of card sellers appeared on the \"xss\"\nforum.\n\n\n-----\n\nPicture 12 - Screenshot from \"xss\" forum (AW_cards: \"We recruit suppliers of bank cards\")\n\nAnother unusual promotional move was the sponsorship of a contest for users who were\nasked to submit articles about penetration tests, the bypassing of security solutions,\nvulnerabilities and other hacking related topics. The organizers claimed to draw a $15,000\nprize for users on the xss forum.\n\nFigure 13 - Screenshot from \"xss\" forum (Xss forum admin: \"We are starting ARTICLES\n_COMPETITION # 6 \"XSS Hot Summer\". With our already usual prize fund - $ 15,000. \")_\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 14 - Screenshot from Group-IB Threat Intelligence & Attribution system\n\nThis topic on the forum appeared 5 days after the first message from the owner of the card\nshop. Most likely, \"AW_cards\" talked about this contest with the \"xss\" administrator even\nbefore the card shop was launched.\n\nFigure 15 - Screenshot from \"xss\" forum (Xss forum admin: \"Competition sponsor Sponsor\n_AW_cards.\"_\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 14 - Screenshot from Group-IB Threat Intelligence & Attribution system\n\nDespite the fact that \"All World Cards\" is a new name among card shops, its owner is not\nnew to the business of selling cards and administering such resources.\n\nAW_cards has also written reviews in several threads with already published articles.\n\nFigure 16 - Screenshot from Group-IB Threat Intelligence & Attribution system\n\nFigure 17 - Screenshot from \"xss\" forum (AW_cards: \"It looks like a winner. Good luck in the\n_competition!\")_\n\nIt is also worth noting that the \"AW_cards\" account on the \"xxs\" forum has a deposit of 0.27\nBitcoin ($ 8,500 at the August 2021 exchange).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 18 - User page form \"xss\" forum\n\nThis deposit can be spent on various transactions on the forum, but it can also serve as\ninsurance and used to pay damages in case the deposit owner cheats on someone.\n\nMaking a deposit is most likely also some kind of advertisement, as forum users are more\nlikely to trust accounts with deposit.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThis is a unique case in which a new name for the marketplace business is using such a\nlarge financial investment to advertise its own cardshop. A total of 1 million cards offered for\nfree is a unique case.\n\nDespite the new name, the actions of the owners of the card shop to promote the new\nplatform indicate that they are likely to be no strangers to this business. Since the creation of\nthe market 2 months ago, more than 3.8 million cards have been placed on a card shop and\nmore than 2.6 million are now on sale. Not all of the currently existing card shops can\nprovide such an amount of compromised data.\n\nSuch a generous offer may indicate that \"All World Cards\" came into this business seriously\nand for a long time. This is most likely not the last time we hear about this card shop.\n\n\n-----",
