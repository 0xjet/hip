Together with an outside cybersecurity firm, the Company is\nconducting an investigation into the circumstances of the activity to determine its nature,\nscope, duration and impacts. The Company’s preliminary analysis indicates that foreign\ngovernment involvement may be associated with this activity, and that data was taken. To the\nCompany’s knowledge, its systems housing customer and financial data were not affected.\nThe Company is remediating the issue, and to date has not experienced any related\ninterruptions to its business operations or systems. Based on its investigation to date, the\nCompany believes the activity is contained. At this time, the Company is unable to estimate\nthe expenses it will incur in connection with its investigation and remediation efforts.\"\n\n## Possibly linked to China-backed threat actors\n\nWSJ who [first reported on the incident states the breach affected major news arms of the](https://www.wsj.com/articles/cyberattack-on-news-corp-believed-linked-to-china-targeted-emails-of-journalists-others-11643979328?st=yrhf72fjgcuccqv&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink)\nconglomerate including The Wall Street Journal, New York Post, and the company's U.K.\nnews operation.\n\nAccording to WSJ's report, the incident allowed threat actors to access emails and\ndocuments of some News Corp employees, including journalists.\n\nA statement provided by Mandiant explains that the cyber attack is possibly linked to Chinabacked threat actors.\n\n\"Mandiant assesses that those behind this activity have a China nexus, and we believe they\nare likely involved in espionage activities to collect intelligence to benefit China's interests,\"\nsays David Wong, vice president of incident response at Mandiant.\n\nWhile disclosing further risks to its IT infrastructure, News Corp stressed, the cyber risk\ninsurance policy it has in place may not be sufficient \"to cover all losses from any breaches\"\nthat have occurred or may occur in the future.\n\n\n-----\n\nCyber risk insurance has also become more difficult and expensive to obtain, and the\ncompany cannot be certain that its current level of insurance or the breadth of its terms and\nconditions will continue to be available on economically reasonable terms,\" states News\n[Corp in its quarterly filing.](https://investors.newscorp.com/node/11716/html)\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Hackers target Russian govt with fake Windows updates pushing RATs](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-target-russian-govt-with-fake-windows-updates-pushing-rats/)\n\n[General Motors credential stuffing attack exposes car owners info](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/general-motors-credential-stuffing-attack-exposes-car-owners-info/)\n\n[Ransomware attack exposes data of 500,000 Chicago students](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-attack-exposes-data-of-500-000-chicago-students/)\n\n[Chinese ‘Space Pirates’ are hacking Russian aerospace firms](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/chinese-space-pirates-are-hacking-russian-aerospace-firms/)\n\n[Engineering firm Parker discloses data breach after ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/engineering-firm-parker-discloses-data-breach-after-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[Ax Sharma](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/ax-sharma/)\n\nAx Sharma is a Security Researcher and Tech Reporter.
