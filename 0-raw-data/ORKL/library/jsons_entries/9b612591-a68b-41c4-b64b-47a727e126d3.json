The system was infected after the](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language))\n[user was redirected to a compromised bogus site, where JavaScript code caused an applet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)\ncontaining an exploit to load. An executable file was saved on the local machine, which was\nused to download and run malicious code from a remote location. The malware also\nswitched between various servers for optimized load balancing. Each bot was given a unique\nID that was sent to the control server.[6] The trojan, however, would only infect the user\nvisiting the infected web page, meaning other users on the computer were not infected\nunless their user accounts had been infected separately.[11]\n\n## Resolution\n\n\n[Oracle, the company that develops Java, fixed the vulnerability exploited to install Flashback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Corporation)\non February 14, 2012.[8] However, at the time of Flashback's release, Apple maintained the\nMac OS X version of Java and did not release an update containing the fix until April 3, 2012,\n\n[12] after the flaw had already been exploited to install Flashback on 600,000 Macs.[13] On\n\nApril 12, 2015, the company issued a further update to remove the most common Flashback\nvariants [14] [The updated Java release was only made available for Mac OS X Lion and Mac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_Lion)\n\n\n-----\n\n[OS X Snow Leopard; the removal utility was released for Intel versions of Mac OS X Leopard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_Snow_Leopard)\nin addition to the two newer operating systems. Users of older operating systems were\nadvised to disable Java.[12] There are also some third party programs to detect and remove\nthe Flashback trojan.[13] Apple worked on a new process that would eventually lead to a\nrelease of a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) for Mac OS X at the same time it would be\navailable for Windows, Linux, and Solaris users.[15] As of January 9, 2014, about 22,000\nMacs were still infected with the Flashback trojan.[16]\n\n## See also\n\n References\n\n1. ^ This is the name used in Apple's built-in anti-malware software XProtect.
