The hackers hijacked download links on**\n**the website causing visitors to download a dangerous banking trojan, Win32.Bolik.2,**\n**and the Trojan.PWS.Stealer (KPOT stealer) along with the editing software.**\n\nVSDC is a popular, free software for editing video and sound. According to SimilarWeb\nstatistics, monthly visits of the VSDC website come close to 1.3 million users. However, the\nsecurity measures taken by the website’s developers often turn out to be insufficient for such\ntraffic volume, which endangers a large number of people.\n\n\n-----\n\nLast year unknown hackers gained access to the administrative side of the VSDC website\nand replaced the download links. Instead of the editing software, users received a JavaScript\nfile, which then downloaded the AZORult Stealer, X-Key Keylogger and the DarkVNC\nbackdoor. The VSDC team stated that they closed the vulnerability, but recently we received\ninformation about additional cases of infection through their website.\n\nAccording to our researchers, the VSDC developer’s computer has been compromised\nseveral times since the previous incident. One such hack led to the website being\ncompromised again between 2019-02-21 and 2019-03-23. This time hackers took a different\napproach to spreading the malware: they embedded a malicious JavaScript code inside the\nVSDC website. Its task was to determine the visitor’s geolocation and replace download links\nfor users from the UK, USA, Canada and Australia. Native website links were substituted by\nlinks to another compromised website:\n\nhttps://thedoctorwithin[.]com/video_editor_x64.exe\nhttps://thedoctorwithin[.]com/video_editor_x32.exe\nhttps://thedoctorwithin[.]com/video_converter.exe\n\nUsers that downloaded software from that website also received a dangerous banking trojan,\nWin32.Bolik.2. Same as its predecessor, **[Win32.Bolik.1, this malware has qualities of a](https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Win32.Bolik.1&lng=en)**\nmulticomponent polymorphic file virus. Trojans of this family are designed to perform web\ninjections, traffic intercepts, key-logging and stealing information from different bank-client\nsystems. At the moment we have information on at least 565 cases of infection with this\ntrojan via videosoftdev.com site. It’s worth mentioning that so far only Dr.Web products\nsuccessfully detect all the trojan’s components.\n\nAdditionally, on 22.03.2019 the attackers changed the Win32.Bolik.2 trojan to another\nmalware, a variation of the Trojan.PWS.Stealer, KPOT Stealer. This trojan steals information\nfrom browsers, Microsoft accounts, several messengers and some other programs. In just\none day it was downloaded by 83 users.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe VSDC developers were notified about the threat; and at the present moment, download\nlinks were restored to the originals. However, Doctor Web experts recommend that all VSDC\nusers check their devices with our antivirus.\n\n[Indicators of compromise](https://github.com/DoctorWebLtd/malware-iocs/tree/master/VSDC)\n\n[#banker](https://news.drweb.com/hashtag/?q=banker) [#banking_trojan](https://news.drweb.com/hashtag/?q=banking_trojan) [#virus](https://news.drweb.com/hashtag/?q=virus)\n\n[What is the benefit of having an account?](https://www.drweb.com/user/advantages/?lng=en)\n\n## Tell us what you think\n\nTo ask Doctor Web’s site administration about a news item, enter @admin at the beginning\nof your comment.
