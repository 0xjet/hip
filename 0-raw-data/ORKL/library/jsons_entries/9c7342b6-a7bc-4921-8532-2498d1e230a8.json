Wikileaks, remember when you challenged us to hack\nyou?\n\nYes, it was OurMine up to their old tricks again, fresh from compromising the social media\n[accounts of football teams FC Barcelona and](https://grahamcluley.com/barcelona-social-media-hacked/) [Real Madrid.](http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/football/real-madrid-welcomes-lionel-messi-after-online-twitter-facebook-account-gets-hacked-4814347/)\n\n**Sign up to our newsletter**\n\nSecurity news, advice, and tips.\nWhy would OurMine want to target WikiLeaks? Well, there isn’t much love lost between\nthem, following the alleged personal details of members of the hacking group were published\n[online was followed by a DDoS attack against the whistle-blowing site in 2016.](https://hotforsecurity.bitdefender.com/blog/wikileaks-knocked-offline-in-ongoing-feud-between-ourmine-hacking-gang-and-anonymous-14918.html)\n\nThe good news for WikiLeaks this time was that things weren’t quite as bad as they might\nhave first appeared.\n\nYou see, the WikiLeaks website hadn’t been hacked.\n\nInstead, OurMine had managed to alter WikiLeaks’s DNS records\n(held by a third-party registrar) to direct anyone who tried to visit\nwikileaks.org to visit a different IP address which definitely wasn’t\nunder the control of Julian Assange and his cronies.\n\nWas that too nerdy for you? Think of it this way. The internet has\n‘telephone directories’, known as DNS (Domain Name System)\nrecords, that translate website names (such as wikileaks.org) into\na numeric address (such as 95.211.113.131) that the internet\nunderstands.\n\n\n-----\n\nChange the numbers in the telephone directory, and anyone trying to get to wikileaks.org\ncould end up somewhere else entirely.\n\nThis kind of domain hijacking isn’t a new threat – past victims have included such well-known\n[services as WhatsApp and anti-virus firm](https://grahamcluley.com/whatsapp-hacked-offline/) [AVG – but it’s a very effective way to embarrass an](https://grahamcluley.com/avg-website-palestinian-hackers/)\norganisation publicly, and even (in the worst cases) attempt to scam visitors or redirect them\nto malware.\n\nAnd while your website’s domain records are under someone else’s control it’s not only\npossible that your website visitors are being redirected, but also that emails being sent to\nyour organisation are being sent somewhere else entirely too.\n\nWe don’t know how OurMine managed to access WikiLeaks’s DNS records, but past\nexperience has shown that their typical modus operandi is simply to log in using their victim’s\npassword.\n\nIf that happened in this case then it’s possible that someone at WikiLeaks was either\nphished, had an easy-to-guess password, fell victim to some spyware, or made the mistake\nof reusing the same password in different places.\n\nAlternatively, the attackers might have used social engineering to trick WikiLeaks’s DNS\nprovider into handing over the credentials, or simple requested that a password reset link be\nsent to a compromised email address.\n\nFor this reason, many DNS registrars offer additional levels of security beyond passwords –\nsuch as registry locking and two-factor authentication (2FA) – to better protect the critical\ndata they store about your website.\n\nFor instance, the DNS registrar I use for grahamcluley.com is DNSimple which has been\n[supporting 2FA since 2012.](https://support.dnsimple.com/articles/two-factor-authentication/)\n\n\n-----\n\nEven if a malicious hacker has managed to determine the password for your company’s 2FAprotected account at the DNS registry, they shouldn’t be able to access it because they don’t\nknow your one-time numeric PIN.\n\nOf course, it’s always possible that an attacker might exploit a vulnerability in your DNS\nregistrar’s systems to fiddle with your website’s records, perhaps without needing to know\nyour password or bypass 2FA. But such attacks are by their very nature much rarer.\n\nIf you own a website, take advantage of the security features that your DNS registrar offers\nyou – or find an alternative registrar who will do more to protect your account.\n\nAnd if you’re the administrator of the WikiLeaks website, just be grateful that OurMine was\nfeeling more mischievous than malicious – as this attack could have been much more\nserious.\n\n_[Found this article interesting?
