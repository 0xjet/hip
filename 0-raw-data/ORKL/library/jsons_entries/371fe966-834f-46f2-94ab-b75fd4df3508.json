In response,\nACSC said that it would review the findings and communicate with the organizations involved if it found that these had been\ncompromised.\n\nIn our [report published in July 2022, we discussed Gootkit loader’s updated tactics and fileless delivery of Cobalt Strike and other](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/22/g/gootkit-loaders-updated-tactics-and-fileless-delivery-of-cobalt-strike.html)\nmalicious payloads. The group’s recent campaign indicates it has more tricks up its sleeve.\n\n[To push the infection to the next phase of the routine, Gootkit loader abused VLC Media Player, a legitimate product that was also](https://www.videolan.org/)\n[used by APT10. We discuss important findings in the next section.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/chinese-hackers-abuse-vlc-media-player-to-launch-malware-loader/)\n\nInfection timeline\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. Gootkit loader’s infection timeline\nKey findings\n\n**Use of SEO poisoning targeting the Australian healthcare industry**\n\nThe samples we examined targeted the keywords “hospital”, “health”, “medical”, and “enterprise agreement”, paired with\nAustralian city names. Also targeted were names of specific healthcare providers across Australia. While continuously targeting\nthe legal sector with the keyword \"agreement,\" Gootkit loader has recently expanded its assaults to the healthcare industry.\n\n[In October 2022, a private health insurance company in Australia reported a cyberattack resulting in a breach of approximately 9.7](https://www.medibank.com.au/health-insurance/info/cyber-security/customer-notice/)\nmillion customer data. Although the recent campaign might remind us of this incident, the technique the malicious actors used in\nthe initial access to the insurance company's attack was not disclosed in its official website report. As well, there is no evidence to\nsuggest a possible link between the two campaigns, as dummy content for SEO poisoning might have been hosted prior to the\nattack on the Australian healthcare organizations.\n\n**Abuse of VLC Media Player**\n\nThe abuse of VLC Media Player, a widely used legitimate tool, is another key feature of this attack. VLC Media Player is one of the\n[most popular pieces of software with over 3.5 billion downloads for Windows alone. In the past, there have been reports of a](https://www.videolan.org/press/videolan-20.html)\nsimilar abuse by APT10. The malware authors sideloaded the following malicious DLL to abuse VLC Media Player and\nmanipulated it as a part of Cobalt Strike:\n\n   -   msdtc.exe (renamed “VLC Media Player” and a legitimate file)\n\n   -   libvlc.dll (malicious, detected as Trojan.Win64.COBEACON.SWG)\n\nNeither were originally installed on the victim’s computer but were introduced by the malicious actor in the infection chain.\n\n**Timeline analysis**\n\n**Initial access: Malicious file download by SEO poisoning**\n\n[As previously reported by Red Canary, the malicious ZIP file name and the JavaScript (JS) file name that it contained used words](https://redcanary.com/blog/gootloader/)\nthat were deemed as top search queries with a strong correlation to the word “agreement”\n\n\n-----\n\nWe observed SEO poisoning in one of the cases that we probed. Two contaminated search results marked in red appeared on the\nfirst page for search terms that include the word “agreement”. Here, we saw words related to Australia, such as the name of a\nlocal medical group and “Brisbane”, in addition to medical terms such as “hospital”, “nursing”, and “midwifery”.\n\nFigure 2. Contaminated search results by SEO poisoning; specific group names are masked\nUpon accessing the site, the user is presented with a screen that has been made to look like a legitimate forum, as shown in\nFigure 3. Users are led to access the link so that the malicious ZIP file can be downloaded.\n\nFigure 3. The page impersonating a forum that leads users to download a malicious ZIP file to trigger the infection\nFigure 4 shows one of the samples we identified during our investigation. We can see that the ZIP file and JS file names contained\nkeywords separated by a space or an underscore, with five random numbers for the ZIP and three or five letters for the JS file,\nenclosed in parentheses and appended to the end of the file name. The name of the target organization can be found in the\nnames of the scheduled task that was created.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4. Chain of malicious files with file names and Gootkit loader\n\nfeatures\nNote that characteristics such as search words in the file names and scheduled task names help identify this threat. To this day,\nwe continue to see a strong correlation between the word “agreement” and targeted medical domains in specific regions (confined\nto Australia in this campaign), as shown in Figure 2. Figure 4 shows a palpable correlation with generic words.\n\n**Evasion**\n\nSites that direct users to download malicious files due to SEO poisoning look like legitimate WordPress sites that have been\ncompromised and abused. Twitter user [@GootLoader Sites pointed out that some compromised sites have already been abused](https://twitter.com/GootLoaderSites/status/1593971561194831873)\nfor this purpose and that there is an analysis evasion mechanism.\n\nWe have indeed observed analysis evasion in the samples. The compromised site hosts several pages containing words\ncharacteristic of those used for SEO poisoning. Users unwittingly open the URL of a contaminated search result, and once they\naccess the counterfeit forum screen, they find that it displays SEO content when they access the same URL for a while.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5. SEO content to increase search rankings is displayed in the same URL as the fake forum screen.\n**File comparison**\n\nIn addition, the malicious JavaScript inserts its code into a legitimate JS file at random segments on the compromised websites.\n[Figure 6 shows an old JavaScript toolkit from here.](https://philogb.github.io/jit/)\n\nFigure 6. File comparison of the original file versus the file infected by Gootkit loader\nThe entries in green represent the inserted function to the original JavaScript for malicious purposes.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7. File comparison to show\n\ninserted codes\n**Obfuscation**\n\nObfuscation is not only a technique for evading analysis but also a useful way to help identify malicious actors. The obfuscation\nmethods used in the samples also show features of Gootkit loader's current activities, which will help security teams to detect this\nthreat.\n\nFigure 8 shows a part of the malicious JS file. The second anonymous function uses numbers, lowercase letters (from a to z), and\nuppercase letters (from A to Z) for obfuscation, with a few numbers and no readable words. The third anonymous function uses\nmainly lowercase letters (from a to z) and uppercase letters (from A to Z) for obfuscation. Numbers rarely appear but still seem to\nserve a function. In addition, the content to be executed is piped and shuffled with readable words, while other readable words can\nalso be seen in some places.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8. A section of the file named How_to_sign_a_letter_on_behalf_of_a_company (jpwri).js\n[Figure 9 shows the pipe-separated and shuffled part of the executed content with readable words, deobfuscated by JS NICE.](http://jsnice.org/)\n\nFigure 9. The content to be\n\nexecuted is piped and shuffled with readable words\n**First stage of infection: Setting a scheduled task for persistence**\n\nThe goal of the first stage of infection is to set a scheduled task for persistence.\n\nAfter the user downloads the malicious ZIP file and the JS inside it is executed, a scheduled task is created and executed in the\nflow as shown in Figure 4. The JS file registered in the scheduled task will be called by wscript.exe as a short name for Windows\n8.3.\n\nFor example, C:\\Users\\[username]\\AppData\\Roaming\\Entrust Security Store\\Object Relations.js was called as\n_C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\wscript.EXE OBJECT~1.JS._\n\nLike the initial JavaScript that was executed, this newly dropped JS file is also heavily obfuscated.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 10. Code snippet from Object Relations.js\nAnother surprising feature of the JavaScript that was used is its unusually large file size at an estimated 50 megabytes. The large\nnumber of bytes is filled with a string of characters. The purpose is unclear, but it might be aimed at interfering with file handling\nand analysis.\n\nHere is the execution chain of the script:\n\nScheduled task → wscript.exe → cscript.exe→ PowerShell\n\nThereafter, C&C access is performed from the PowerShell.\n\nFigure 11. A portion of the decoded code as captured by a Windows Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI) event\n**C&C access**\n\nA process launched from a scheduled task runs a PowerShell script and retrieves files for subsequent engagement from the\nserver that abused WordPress on the legitimate site.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe process has top level domains for various countries and has the file name xmlrpc.php directly under it. It appears to have 10\nURLs per script, all of which are potential destinations. Several random attempts will be made from these.\n\n**Waiting time**\n\nThe second stage of infection takes place after the waiting time. While waiting, the scheduled task performed approximately two\nC&C accesses per day, with no additional processes executed after the C&C accesses. We observed the waiting time to be\nseveral hours and in some cases, two days.\n\nThis latency, which clearly separates the initial infection stage from the second stage, is a distinctive feature of Gootkit loader's\noperation. Currently, operations in the second stage observed at the same season are similar. Therefore, it does not appear, for\nnow, that multiple threat actors are entering the operation from this second stage.\n\n**Second stage of infection: Use of Cobalt Strike**\n\nUpon successful connection to the C&C server and when the waiting time is over, msdtc.exe and libvlc.dll are dropped. The file\nname msdtc.exe impersonates the name of a legitimate Windows component; the entity is a legitimate VLC Media Player.\n\nFigure 12. File information related\n\nto the hash of msdtc.exe\nThe legitimate file, msdtc.exe (which is VLC Media Player renamed) loads libvlc.dll with its function as a module related to Cobalt\nStrike with the DLL sideloading technique. From this point onward, msdtc.exe acts as a part of Cobalt Strike while still being a\nvalid signed and legitimate executable program.\n\nFigure 13. OAT detection related to DLL sideloading\n**Post-Cobalt Strike infection**\n\n\n-----\n\nWe investigated the process memory dump of the msdtc.exe runtime that loads libvlc.dll with [1768.py, a tool to analyze Cobalt](https://isc.sans.edu/diary/rss/29014)\n[Strike beacons created by Didier Stevens. The result shows that C&C for this Cobalt Strike was 193[.]106[.]191[.]187 and spawns](https://isc.sans.edu/handler_list.html#didier-stevens)\nto dllhost.exe.\n\nFigure 14. Config dump from Cobalt Strike process\n**Process injection**\n\nWe took a closer look at the processes, particularly dllhost.exe and wabmig.exe, and found that they were spawned from the\nabused VLC Media Player that became the host to malicious code execution through process injection and then became a beacon\nfor Cobalt Strike and its subsequent activities.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 15.\n\nProcess chain showing activities related to msdtc.exe\n**Abuse of legitimate tools**\n\nNote that in addition to VLC Media player, which was introduced at the beginning of the second stage, both dllhost.exe and\n_wabmig.exe, are legitimate files._\n\nThe abuse of legitimate tools has become a common practice, likely aiming for effects such as misleading, misunderstanding, and\nbeing overlooked as power-consuming from the human perspective, as well as evading detection by antiviruses (both pattern\ndetection and behavior monitoring) from the technical perspective.\n\n**Discovery**\n\nThe malicious actors introduced the following additional tools to facilitate discovery:\n\nPSHound.ps1: Detected as HackTool.PS1.BloodHound.C for SharpHound and executed via Cobalt Strike.\n\nsoo.ps1: Detected as Trojan.Win32.FRS.VSNW0EK22\nMultiple outbound connections to internal machines toward ports 389, 445, and 3268\nPort 445: Remote network share SMB\nPort 389, 3268: LDAP ports\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 16.\n\nTelemetry showing outbound traffic to ports 389, 445, and 3268\n**Credential access**\n\nThe file krb.txt was created by one of the injected processes that contains Kerberos hashes for several accounts. Given that we\ndid not see any dumping activity in the process telemetry, the dumping process transpired in the memory; it did not introduce a\nnew tool or an executable file to do the dumping.\n\n**Impact**\n\nThe final payload is unknown for this case since we detected it and responded to it while it was in the middle of the infection chain.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOur monitoring of Gootkit loader activity that uses SEO poisoning has revealed that the malicious actors behind it are actively\nimplementing their campaign. The threats targeting specific job sectors, industries, and geographic areas are becoming more\naggressive. In addition to the continued targeting of the legal sector with the word \"agreement”, we also found that the current\noperation has also clearly sharpened its targeting capability by including the words \"hospital\", \"health\", \"medical\", and names of\nAustralian cities.\n\nThe abuse of VLC Media Player by APT10 has been reported in the past, which might have brought attention to some security\nteams of such an abuse. DLL sideloading has become a classic method in APT operations, and it no longer comes as a surprise\nfor threat researchers to find it being used in similar campaigns. However, the abuse of legitimate tools has become commoditized\ntoday and has been observed in non-APT operations as well.\n\nTo mitigate the impact of cyberthreats, it is necessary to know that these tactics and techniques are in the wild. In this case,\nsearch engine results might be contaminated to download malicious files by SEO poisoning, and legitimate tools might perform\nmalicious behavior because they have been abused. Therefore, security teams should always consider the possibility of DLL\nsideloading or the injection of malicious code, as the abuse of legitimate tools has become commonplace.\n\nGiven that technical solutions are updated as new attack methods are discovered, we recommend security teams to configure\ntheir security solutions and follow industry best practices. Moreover, if there is a gap between the trending tactics and the technical\nsolutions due to timing, the security team's work, human observation, and decisions might be needed.\n\nEven if an organization’s security solutions are configured correctly, there might be instances when this is not enough to ward off\nthreats. Malicious actors can deploy new and more advanced variants of the malware using techniques that can evade detection,\nso your organization’s security operations center (SOC) team and threat analysts should be able to effectively spot any malicious\n\n\n-----\n\nactivity in your network to address it in a timely manner.\n\n**Security recommendations**\n\n_For targeted industries:_\n\nAs noted in this blog, Gootkit loader is currently targeting the Australian healthcare industry in addition to the legal sector. It is not\neasy to escape the methods of an adversary, but in this case, it might be effective to inform users that this is the case.\n\nNotifying people in the targeted legal sector and the Australian healthcare industry that their search results might be poisoned and\ntraining them by showing them the screenshots in Figures 2 and 3 might help mitigate damage. Along with this, security products\nmust be properly configured and kept up to date.\n\n_For security teams:_\n\nWhen adversaries abuse a legitimate tool, the techniques they use can vary, but the malicious code must be prepared, loaded,\nand run. Legitimate tools themselves might be difficult to detect, but traditional antivirus software can detect the files containing\nmalicious code, while extended detection and response (EDR) or human incident response can mitigate the impact by spotting it.\n\nAs we saw in this case, one such event is the detection of libvlc.dll, which was sideloaded by VLC Media Player. This type of DLL\nsideloading is usually performed by a code-signed process loading an unsigned, unknown DLL. Observations done in this context\ncan also help security teams to address the threat.\n\nThe process injection of the wabmig.exe tool is also another noteworthy technique in this operation. For process injection, the\nmalicious code does not exist as a standalone file but only in memory. Since wabmig.exe is a standard address book import tool\nthat comes with Windows, it is not expected to be used frequently in modern enterprise environments. For this reason, consider\nthe launch of wabmig.exe itself as an initial sign of abuse. Note that abuse of wabmig.exe for the usage of Cobalt Strike has also\n[been reported in the Follina case from Microsoft.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2021/09/15/analyzing-attacks-that-exploit-the-mshtml-cve-2021-40444-vulnerability/)\n\n_For web administrators:_\n\nMeanwhile, web administrators should keep in mind that running a vulnerable WordPress site can result in being part of such a\n[threat. Therefore, following the latest security best practices when building a website is crucial. As described in Hardening](https://wordpress.org/support/article/hardening-wordpress/)\nWordPress, do not get plug-ins or themes from untrusted sources. Restrict yourself to the WordPress.org repository or well-known\ncompanies. And, of course, make sure your plug-ins are always updated.\n\nTo know if your website is affected by this threat, look at the number of pages with words like \"agreement\" that are being\ngenerated. If your site has a number of pages with such content, this can be an indication that the site has been compromised and\nyou should act promptly to contain any damage that the attack might have caused.\n\n**Trend Micro Solutions**\n\nWe recommend security solutions that provide comprehensive protection for your enterprise to keep this and other threats at bay.\n\n[Trend Micro Vision One™ helps security teams gain an overall view of attempts in ongoing campaigns by providing them with a](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/business/products/detection-response.html)\ncorrelated view of multiple layers such as email, endpoints, servers, and cloud workloads.
