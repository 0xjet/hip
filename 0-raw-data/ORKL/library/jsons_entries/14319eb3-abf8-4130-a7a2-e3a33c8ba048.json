The group is\nalso known by the various malware variants it uses (Ryuk, Trickbot, and Conti, among others).\nIt is a financially motivated cybercrime group first identified in 2017, and may be one of\nthe wealthiest groups currently in operation, with total assets easily in excess hundreds of\nmillions of dollars.\n\nThe group’s extraordinary profitability allows its leaders to invest in illicit research and\ndevelopment initiatives. Wizard Spider is fully capable of hiring specialist talent, building new\ndigital infrastructure, and purchasing access to advanced exploits. It has also apparently\ninvested in its own panel-hosting cracking application and hired telephone operators to\ncold-call victims and scare them into paying.\n\nThe PTI team has been actively tracking the Wizard Spider group since releasing our first\npublic report in November 2021. This prevented hundreds of ransomware attacks and\nnotified more than 128000 victims that were targeted by the group. These victims include\ndefense and aerospace companies, food producers, supply chain providers, hospitals,\ngovernment agencies, and critical infrastructure providers. We obtained visibility into critical\nelements of the group’s infrastructure and collected vital data on its kill chain, as shown below.\n\nIntrusion\n\nBazarLoader\n\nServer Backup\n\nCracking\n\nStation\n\nExtortion\n\nQBot SystemBC Cobalt Strike\n\nServer\n\nEncryption\n\nServer\n\nPublic Leak\n\nServer\n\nLocker\nSoftware\n\n**Figure 1.

The PTI team has been collecting data on\nWizard Spider’s operations since publishing its first report on Conti in November 2021.\n\nOur team has discovered valuable new information about Wizard Spider and its relationship\nto other cybercrime groups and software producers. This report contains technical analysis\non Wizard Spider’s capabilities and its command structure, which includes a complex set of\nsub-teams divided into software-specific groups. Wizard Spider is capable of managing\nattacks from start to finish using its own distributed capabilities, assigning pre-attack\npreparations to certain teams and post-exploitation tasks to others.\n\n\n#### Spam Download Infection\n\n\n#### SystemBC Cracking\n\n\n#### Breach Encryption\n\n\n#### 160M 5.5M 650K 128K ~750 ~100 ~5\n\n**Figure 2. Risks to contain Wizard Spider’s attack at each stage.**\n\nThis report will help organizations prepare for highly coordinated cyberattacks that use\ndistributed command structures to exploit high-value targets. Its insights will help security\nprofessionals protect sensitive data and assets from the multiple exploitation stages that\ncharacterize a Wizard Spider attack. Note that risks and costs to contain these attacks\nincrease at later stages, as shown in Figure 2.\n\nThe PRODAFT Threat Intelligence team is publishing this data now to help information\nsecurity leaders detect and respond to attacks that use malware variants in Wizard Spider’s\ntechnology stack. Recent public leaks about the threat actors behind Conti ransomware\nhave pushed our publication deadline ahead of schedule. The PTI team has extensively\ncovered Conti ransomware in the past, and is now extending that investigation by publishing\nnew data and insights into the inner workings of Wizard Spider.\n\n5 / 35\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document and its contents shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged information of PRODAFT and shall\n\nbe subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in the General Data Protection Regulation and Personal\n\nData Protection Law No. 6698. It shall be noted that PRODAFT provides this information “as is” according to its findings, without\n\npro iding an legall applicable arrant regarding completeness or acc rac of the contents Therefore neither this report\n\n\n-----\n\n### 3 Technical Analysis\n\nThis section outlines the tools, techniques, and tactics Wizard Spider uses to carry out\nits attacks. It contains vital information about the group’s distribution mechanism, locker\nsample, intrusion server, extortion server, backup storage, and the hash cracking station.\n\nBased on our observations, the team’s attack starts with the mass-scale spam campaign\nusing QBot and proxy malware (SystemBC) with the help of compromised business email\nconversations. Then, another team uses domain-based selection to pinpoint the valuable\ntargets for their ransom demands and deploy Cobalt Strike for lateral movement activities.\nIf the intrusion team successfully obtains the domain admin privilege, they deploy Conti’s\nransomware strain. This section provides our findings on their operational environment.\n\n#### 3.1 Hypervisor Encryption Server\n\nDuring the investigation, the PTI team discovered a unique system used by the Wizard\nSpider’s sub-team that targets the hypervisor servers (e.g., VMWare ESXi) with the Conti\nransomware strain. After threat actors exfiltrate data from their victim’s servers, they prepare\nand upload a special locker software on their own Locker Software Server. This locker\nsoftware directly targets hypervisor servers and encrypts them, leaving a ransom note on\nthe desktop, in the characteristic style of a typical Conti ransomware attack.\n\nFurther investigation revealed that the attackers directly scanned and exploited hundreds of\nVMware vCenter servers with Log4j (CVE-2021-44228) vulnerabilities.[3] Interestingly, several\nscanner IP addresses were also used as Cobalt Strike C2 servers in the subsequent attacks.\n\n**3.1.1** **Auto-Locker Deployment**\n\nAt the time of our analysis, the PTI team detected and performed detailed analysis on\nthe following Hypervisor Encryption Server.\n\n**Username** **IP** **Country** **ISP**\npp 194.37.97.134 United States M247 Ltd\n\n**Table 1. Hypervisor encryption server details.**\n\nThe PTI team’s investigation into the target host allowed us to gain access to Wizard\nSpider’s auto-encryption panel. The panel expects several input to perform their\ntasks. By inputting victim access credentials obtained via SOCKS IPs, threat actors\ncould drop locker malware directly onto victim’s devices and servers. The SOCKS proxy IP\naddresses that were used generally connect with Cobalt Strike servers used by Wizard Spider.\n\nIf this locker attack fails, threat actors will reuse the same locker software for other attacks.\nEach of the fields on the panel has a specific role to play encrypting victims’ servers.\n\n6 / 35\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document and its contents shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged information of PRODAFT and shall\n\nbe subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in the General Data Protection Regulation and Personal\n\nData Protection Law No. 6698.

If the feature is specified, the malware ”forks”, terminating the parent\nprocess and continuing with a ”child” process on the victim system.\n\nThen, the malware makes the necessary adjustments for encryption. Reverse engineering\nstudies showed that the malware performs ”initialization” with the ”Public Key” in ASN.1 format\nusing the ”CryptoPP” library.\n\n**Figure 6. Locker software initialization of encryption method.**\n\nAt the last stage, the malware uses a ”callback” function for all the files it finds and follows\nthe path specified in the ”path” argument. This ”callback” function checks whether the\n”–prockiller” feature is activated. The ”–prockiller” feature searches for processes with names\nspecified in the ”/proc” file system and checks if the related file is executable. The malware\nimmediately terminates every named process it finds in the file system. After the process\nchecking stage, the malware checks the extensions it contains. If the file extension is on the\nlist, the malware will refuse to encrypt that type of file. Figure 7 shows the locker parameters\nobtained from ContiLeaks and verifies our findings.\n\n**Figure 7.

We identified several intrusion servers belonging to Wizard Spider threat\nactors. They contain tactics, techniques, and procedures of threat actors, purchased\nzero-day exploits, connected server addresses, Bitcoin addresses marked for payment, and\nvarious sensitive data on their operational environment. Threat actors kept notes to share\nbetween the teams in the form of encrypted ZIP files.\n\n**3.2.1** **Intrusion Servers**\n\nDuring the investigation of Wizard Spider’s intrusion servers, the PTI team obtained\nvisibility into multiple critical elements of the group’s infrastructure. We obtained valuable\ninformation on tools, user manual files, and existing techniques, tactics, and procedures that\nthreat actors use to test and attack victims’ systems.

The most recent one is the Log4j\nvulnerability mentioned in previous sections. During the PTI team’s analysis of Wizard Spider’s\nintrusion servers, our analysts determined that the Wizard Spider team purchased and used\nzero-day exploits from other threat actors and used current and public vulnerabilities. This\nfinding was corroborated with the information published by Contileaks as well. For simplicity,\nonly some of the samples are showed in this section. However, entire toolkit data can be\nshared with the researchers upon request.\n\nUpon detailed analysis of files on the intrusion server, the PTI team detected a domain named\n**hidusi.com in emergency.html file. Examining the domain logs of the file, our team determined**\nthat Wizard Spider was currently managing a server that exploited the CVE-2021-40444\nzero-day vulnerability.[5] This zero-day vulnerability impacts Microsoft Word and Microsoft\nExplorer with malicious documents that deliver a customized version of Cobalt Strike BEACON.\n\n**Figure 11. Example usage of CVE-2021-40444 exploit.**\n\nIn addition, a file named zero.exe was discovered on the same server. Upon analysis, it\nappeared to establish a connection with the Security Account Manager’s database on the\ntarget system with administrator’s account credentials using ZeroLogon vulnerability. To\ntrigger the corresponding exploit, the threat actor must provide the following parameters :\nTarget IP Address, Domain Controller Name, Domain Name, and Admin Username. The same\nexploit and its usage can be found in ContiLeaks’s public release (internal TrickBot forum).\n\n**Figure 12.

This system stores cracked hashes, updates threat\nactors on the cracking status and shows the results of cracking attempts on other servers.\nThe system can crack the LM:NTLM hashes, cached domain credentials, Kerberos 5\nTGS-REP/AS-REP tickets, KeePass files, MS Office 2013 files, and other types of common\nhashes. Moreover, the cracking station features the following five elements :\n\n1. The hash value (MD5, SHA1, etc.) that the attackers wish to crack.\n2. Description text that reflects individual victim information.\n3. Priority value, which allows attackers to focus on high-value targets first.\n4. Status text shows how the cracking process is going.\n5. The result field contains the decrypted version of the hash value.\n\n**Figure 13. Management panel of the Cracking Station.**\n\nFigure 13 shows the management screen of the cracking station. While analyzing the hashes\ninserted into the database by attackers, we detected a lot of Russian comments (as shown\nin Figure 14). Apparently teams use comments as a simple communication tool. In addition\nto communication, the privileged users track the activity to determine the workload of the\nthreat actors. Therefore, the cracking station plays a crucial role in the team’s operational\nenvironment.\n\n**Figure 14.

Internal conversation between the threat actors on the cold-calling system.**\n\nThe PTI team successfully detected and analyzed the cold-calling system developed\nby the threat actors (as shown in Figure 16). This system is used to store reports of calls,\nhelping various sub-teams coordinate when pressuring victims further. Types of information\nregarding each call are;\n\n1. The unique victim name set by threat actors.\n2. Timestamp of the ransomware attack.\n3. The group ID of the user responsible.\n4.

We detected several storage servers containing the victim’s data during the\nPTI team’s investigation. Interestingly, we identified several folders belonging to the victims\nwho agreed to pay the ransom. This finding is an excellent example that we should not trust\nransomware operators. Table 6 shows the excerpt list of the storage servers.\n\n**Type** **IP** **Country** **ISP**\nWebDAV Extortion 51.91.7.70 France OVH SAS\nWebDAV Extortion 141.94.143.79 France OVH SAS\nWebDAV Extortion 141.94.162.156 France OVH SAS\nFTP Extortion 199.127.63.16 United States RELIABLESITE\nFTP Extortion 104.243.34.234 United States RELIABLESITE\nFTP Extortion 104.243.42.138 United States RELIABLESITE\nBackup 46.148.235.93 Russia SELECTEL\n\n**Table 6. Excerpt list of the storage servers.**\n\n**3.3.1** **REvil Relation**\n\nThe extortion servers periodically transfer their data to a backup server in Russia, which has\na considerable disk size (~26TB). One of the most striking findings is that some of the victims\nin the backup storage were attacked by the REvil ransomware gang around Q1/2021. It\npresents a worrying example of the collaboration between the ransomware gangs. However,\nwe do not have any further information to confirm whether the Wizard Spider team carried\nout these attacks or the stolen data transferred from REvil’s servers into backup storage.\n\n**3.3.2** **Proxy Network**\n\nThe PTI team determined that threat actors manage victim extortion processes and file\ntransfers through a proxy network using WebDAV service, as some of the parts of them are\nshown in Table 7.\n\n**WebDAV Username** **IP** **Country** **ISP**\ncantankerousnesss 85.25.246.169 Germany Host Europe GmbH\nsecularized 51.178.131.223 France OVH SAS\nflotations 45.147.160.196 Netherlands G-Core Labs\nwells 45.147.160.5 Netherlands G-Core Labs\nefeminatef 45.147.160.5 Netherlands G-Core Labs\nerratums 45.147.160.5 Netherlands G-Core Labs\n\n**Table 7.

They even provide access to newly added\nextortion servers through Wireguard instead of accessing them externally. The below lines\nshow the sample Wireguard config file.\n\n```\n[Interface]\nAddress = 10.1.2.1/24\nListenPort = 51871\nPrivateKey = <redacted>\n[Peer]\nPublicKey = <redacted>\nAllowedIPs = 10.1.2.2/32\nEndpoint = 45.147.160.5:51902\nPersistentKeepalive = 25\n\n```\n\n**Console 1. Sample Wireguard config file.**\n\nThe team uses a publicly available Croc tool to transfer the FTP or VPN configuration files\napart from the private keys. They attempt to hide their traces by setting a relay server at the\n**81.4.109.61 (RamNode -Netherlands) IP address. This relay server contains multiple instances**\nrunning on different ports (9009, 9010, 9011, 9012, and 9013). The PTI team observed threat\nactors regularly transferring configuration files for operational needs. Some of the observed\nexecuted Croc commands are listed below :\n\n## • [croc –pass xxx –relay ”81.4.109.61:9009” send /etc/vsftpd]\n • [croc –pass xxx –relay ”81.4.109.61:9009” send vsftpd]\n • [croc –pass xxx –relay ”81.4.109.61:9009” send vsftpd.conf vsftpd.userlist]\n • [croc –pass xxx –relay ”81.4.109.61:9009” send server.pem]\n • [croc –pass xxx –relay ”81.4.109.61:9009” send .confs.tar.gz]\n\n**3.3.4** **QBot Relation**\n\nWhile investigating QBot’s database, the PTI team observed that the threat actors\nobtained several PST files from the Wizard Spider’s extortion servers. The PST files contained\nemail information used in phishing campaigns and critical file detection tasks. The QBot\npanel occasionally parses these PST files obtained from victims, including victims who have\npaid the ransom, to send targeted spam emails. The resulting files are added directly to this\ndatabase and transferred to remote servers via FTP.\n\n20 / 35\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document and its contents shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged information of PRODAFT and shall\n\nbe subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in the General Data Protection Regulation and Personal\n\nData Protection Law No. 6698.

Our infrastructure analysis revealed a\ngreat deal of exclusive, never-before-seen information regarding the group and its technical\ninfrastructure, in addition to the following information :\n\n## • [Highly-secret credentials/documents for at least 30+ victims.]\n • [400+ different binaries including BazarLoader, Qbot, PowerShell scripts, Cobalt Strike]\nbeacons, executable files, exploits, and custom toolkits.\n\n## • [VPN and file transfer tool’s configurations files.]\n • [750+ victim’s kerberos tickets, domain admin passwords, hashes, etc.]\n • [Anonymous credentials used for operational needs.]\n • [5 bitcoin addresses likely owned by a threat actor who plays a role processing victim]\npayments.\n\nThe PTI team observed that one of the threat actors (prince) intended to use following\nbitcoin addresses. Our investigation revealed that some of these bitcoin addresses are\nused in VerifiedForum (elite underground forum), HydraMarket (darknet market), LuxSocks\n(anonymous proxyprovider), and several exchange services like Cryptex, WikiExchange,\nBinance, Bizlato, and ChangeHero.\n\n**Address** **TX** **Received/Balance**\nbc1qfngle3n86u0f6elxesz2tt8curdvn3q0er9whf 48 0.24/0\nbc1q6d045gs6s7f75wmsdcdzdzzn94smjatxgytxdl 137 5.04/0.0007\nbc1quf2fc75jw8nsfpf8fryunwsvpltxmw7adfxw8f 28 0.11/0.047\n3E9GY29xu7CBLsiRjgnHivkSmsRt2vCGNA 2 0.001/0\n3JE7ipFTGaQ9jzJto5gmsuP2pxHCDCoUWw 2 0.002/0\n\nAlthough this particular threat actor uses Rclone, Rsync, and Mega configurations in\nencrypted zip files, the PTI team successfully obtained access to all of these files.

AUCH (Autorenprofile für die Untersuchung von Cyberkriminalität\nCH) is our recently developed deep neural networks empowered author profiling technology.\nAUCH can analyze the language of cybercriminals to reveal important information regarding\ntheir identities. It operates based on data and cyber-insight we have acquired over the\nyears with our unparalleled proactive approach against cybercrime. Our initial report [1] on\nthe Conti cybercrime group covered the possible connections to the Russian Federation\nand the Russian language, and we have extended our earlier analysis in this report and\nreinforced our attribution.\n\n**Figure 20.

Our inference engine recognized the suspected connections\nand concluded that a native Russian speaker wrote the statements. AUCH exploits the\nrecent developments in XAI (Explainable artificial intelligence) to generate human-friendly\nexplanations on the gradient and attention level to provide our threat intelligence analysts\nwith the necessary information to work towards robust cyber-attribution.

The final\nprediction of our system, the Russian language, is known to be lacking the use of determiners.\nThe inconsistent use of determiners is a well-known mistake amongst English L2 speakers.\n\n**3.5.2** **Grammaticality**\n\n**Conti Statement : We will use our resources in order to strike back if the well-being and**\nsafety of peaceful citizens (will) be at stake due to American cyber aggression.\n\nThe profiler points out the faulty tense sequence in the dependent clause of the conditional\nsentence.\n\n**3.5.3** **Choice of Vocabulary**\n\n**Conti Statement : Therefore, it did not publish in free access.**\n\nIn this example, the inference engine pays special attention to the phrases ”did not publish”\nand ”free access.” It seems to be the leading cue for our final inference of the Russian\nlanguage. This situation can be explained by the literal translation of the Russian sentence\n(в свободном доступе.). On the other hand, a native speaker of English would probably\nprefer the sentence ”It was not published freely/publicly/in the public domain.”\n\n\nAUCH is currently a preliminary stage research project supported by the Swiss\nInnovation Agency, Innosuisse. We collaborate with our partners at the University\nof Zurich to integrate cutting-edge linguistics research into cybersecurity. In the\nupcoming months, we will be able to showcase more features we work on to support\nour investigations and consolidate our scientific approach against cybercrime.\n\n\n24 / 35\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document and its contents shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged information of PRODAFT and shall\n\nbe subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in the General Data Protection Regulation and Personal\n\nData Protection Law No. 6698.

Almost all of the group’s targets are enterprise-level corporations.\nWe were able to use this data to glean insight into some of the behavioral patterns,\nworkflows, and activity timelines characteristic of Wizard Spider threat actors.\n\n#### 4.1 Victim Statistics\n\nWizard Spider uses a cluster of SystemBC servers to control thousands of client devices\naround the world.[6] If a victim appears to be a valuable target, threat actors will deploy\nCobalt Strike or similar software to escalate privileges and move laterally through the network.\n\nThe PTI team identified more than 128036 SystemBC victims in total. The SystemBC victim\ndata shows Wizard Spider threat actors mostly targeted Russia 20.5% and the United States\n**12.9%. Although it is seen that threat actors statistically identify victims originating from Russia**\nat a high rate, none of them are encountered in the Cracking or Encryption stages of the\nattack cycle. All details regarding victim origins are shown in Figure 21.\n\n**Figure 21. SystemBC victim distribution by country (Total Victim : 128036).**\n\nWhile these two countries are by far the most popular targets, it’s worth pointing out that other\nmajor economies like China, India, and Brazil are also well represented. Wizard Spider has a\nsignificant presence in almost every developed country in the world, and many emerging\neconomies as well.\n\n25 / 35\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document and its contents shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged information of PRODAFT and shall\n\nbe subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in the General Data Protection Regulation and Personal\n\nData Protection Law No. 6698.

While\nthere is activity stretching back to the end of 2021, it mostly represents small-scale attacks.\nThese could be experiments designed to test and fine-tune various aspects of Wizard\nSpider’s operation, because full-scale attacks targeting thousands of users at a time began\nshortly thereafter, in late January and early February. After a short pause, a major initiative\ntook place at the end of February, resulting in tens of thousands of new victims by early\nMarch. Figure 22 depicts the monthly victim statistics.\n\n**Figure 22.

The PTI team was able to track cracking station\nactivity timelines and generate a chart showing peak usage hours.\n\nInterestingly, it looks like relatively few threat actors made use of Wizard Spider’s specialty\ncracking tool. There is a slight increase in users logging on weekday afternoons, but\nnot enough to indicate regular, sustained use. It’s also likely that users did not have to\nremain logged into the cracking station long when using it, making overall activity look scarce.\n\n**Figure 23. Activity graph of cracking station.**\n\n27 / 35\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document and its contents shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged information of PRODAFT and shall\n\nbe subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in the General Data Protection Regulation and Personal\n\nData Protection Law No. 6698.

New indicators of compromise will give threat intelligence\noperatives better visibility into Wizard Spider attack patterns, improving operational security\nacross the board.\n\nIt’s difficult to overestimate the impact of publishing these findings on a group as large and\nwell-funded as Wizard Spider. With hundreds of thousands of devices infected and a highly\ndistributed professional workflow, even the most conservative estimates indicate Wizard\nSpider commands hundreds of millions of dollars in assets.\n\nThe Wizard Spider team has shown itself capable of monetizing multiple aspects of its\noperations. It is responsible for an enormous quantity of spam on hundreds of millions of\nmillions of devices, as well as concentrated data breaches and ransomware attacks on\nhigh-value targets. We’ve quantified the scale of each attack stage in Figure 2.\n\nThe PRODAFT Threat Intelligence team continues to research Wizard Spider’s capabilities\nand infrastructure to identify new and better defenses against its attacks. Security\nprofessionals and enterprise IT leaders can use this data to catch early indicators of\ncompromise that correspond to Wizard Spider operations and the tactics of the various\nsub-teams it works with, including the Conti ransomware group.\n\n28 / 35\n\nDISCLAIMER : This document and its contents shall be deemed as proprietary and privileged information of PRODAFT and shall\n\nbe subjected to articles and provisions that have been stipulated in the General Data Protection Regulation and Personal\n\nData Protection Law No. 6698.
