On one hand, they may burn\nthe leaked tool since it got either publicly known or it facilitates the analysis of the tool\nsignificantly. On the other hand, it transfers capabilities to other, possibly lower-skilled\nactors. In my new blog post I analyze a newer version of Ursnif, which has been turned into\nan exploration tool and downloader. Because: In case of malicious software, source code\nleaks are very remarkable events. But first a small classification to get started. A notable\n\n\n-----\n\nexample from the cyber security history was the leak of the exploit code Eternal Blue (CVE2017-0144) in 2017. This very powerful remote exploit empowered many lower-skilled actors\nto conduct intrusions with ease.\n\nSuch leaks have occurred every now and then and they will most likely continue to occur in\nthe years to come. The leak of the banking Trojan Zeus definitely shaped the malware\nlandscape during the 2010s. Its source code was leaked in 2010. What followed was a\nplethora of offspring that share the same code base with the original Zeus banking Trojan.\nFor instance, the [zeusmuseum lists 28 families including Citadel, Pandabanker, and more](https://zeusmuseum.com/)\nrecently Zloader. Many families continued to operate as banking Trojans like their ancestor\n[but some of them adopted another purpose like the downloader Zloader.](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.zloader)\n\nBesides the Zeus source code leak, there are many more interesting leaks, each of them\ndeserves its own story. In this blog article, I focus on another malware family whose source\ncode got leaked in 2014. This family is called Ursnif (also known as Gozi2/ISFB). Ursnif is a\nfully-fledged banking Trojan. There has been many great technical as well as historical work\n[on this family in the recent years. For instance, Maciej Kotowicz wrote a very good write-up](https://lokalhost.pl/txt/isfb_still.live.and.licking.Botconf2016.pdf)\n[on this family in 2016 and the podcast “Malicious Life” produced two episodes about the](https://malicious.life/gozi-and-the-rise-of-malware-as-a-service/)\nhistory of Gozi, the ancestor of Ursnif. Today, the source code of Ursnif can be easily found\non the Internet. Many actors took this solid code base and based their work on it.\n\nIn this blog post, I analyze a recent Ursnif variant, which was repurposed to be a\nreconnaissance tool and downloader. It is a modern variant utilizing techniques like LOLBins,\nComponent Object Model (COM) interfaces to instrument the Internet Explorer and as a\nconsequence bypass local proxies as well as Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)\nto interact with the operating system in place of native Win32 APIs. Campaigns associated\nwith this variant start with a cascade of several layers of obfuscation, which ensures that the\ndetection rate is very low, even several days after a campaign has started. This variant plays\nan important role in these campaigns which appear to be targeted cybercrime attacks.\n\nIt was [first publicly mentioned in August 2019, which is in line with the registration dates of](https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/ursnif-variant-spreading-word-document.html)\nsome associated domains and it gained momentum in autumn and winter 2019/2020.\nRecently, a [blog article scrutinized one of its campaigns in April 2020, pointing out its use of](https://thedfirreport.com/2020/04/24/ursnif-via-lolbins/)\n[LOLBins. In a nutshell, LOLBins stands for “Living Off the Land Binaries”, which means to](https://lolbas-project.github.io/)\nutilize system tools that are already on a target system in order to carry out nefarious\n[purposes. For instance, there are dozens of Windows system tools that can be utilized to](https://lolbas-project.github.io/)\ndownload files, dump credentials, or execute other binaries. As a consequence, attacks do\nnot need to bring their own tools and may hide their traces in other legitimate uses of these\ntools.\n\nTo the best of my knowledge, it is not yet tracked under its own name. Since the Ursnif\nvariant that I will look into in this blog article makes use of LOLBins and there is already a\n[reference to this (“Ursnif via LOLbins”), I will refer to it as LOLSnif in the following.](https://thedfirreport.com/2020/04/24/ursnif-via-lolbins/)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Digging Deeper into A Recent Campaign\n\nAt first, I will look into a recent LOLSnif campaign started on 2020-04-07 in order to get an\nidea of the actors TTPs. Later, I will zoom out and review recent activity of other campaigns\nof the associated actor.\n\nEach campaign begins with a cascade of several layers of obfuscation. It all starts with a\nspam email that contains an encrypted ZIP archive. The mail mentions the password for\ndecryption and encourages the recipient to open it.\n\nThe next layer is a 1.34 MB sized, heavily obfuscated JavaScript file called\n“my_presentation_v8s.js”\n(4d98790aa67fb14f6bedef97f5f27ea8a60277dda9e2dcb8f1c0142d9619ef52). Its first\n[submission to VirusTotal was on 2020-04-07 and its initial detection rate was very low. This](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/4d98790aa67fb14f6bedef97f5f27ea8a60277dda9e2dcb8f1c0142d9619ef52/detection/f-4d98790aa67fb14f6bedef97f5f27ea8a60277dda9e2dcb8f1c0142d9619ef52-1586270067)\nJavaScript file ultimately drops a PE executable with file name “UtBuefba.txt“ as well as a\ntext file to “AppData\\Local\\Temp”. The text file contains what appears to be an eight\ncharacter long ASCII key that the PE executable requires to unpack properly. This might be a\nway to thwart analysis if only the PE executable is shared.\n\nThe DLL is first launched via “regsvr32.exe -s [redacted]\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\\\UtBuefba.txt”.\nThe option “-s” stands for silent registration, which does not show a dialog box. Even though\n[DLLs to be loaded with regsvr32 are required to comprise the exports “DllRegisterServer”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regsvr32)\nand “DllUnregisterServer”, this DLL does not export them. It has just a regular DLL entry\npoint. However, this file unpacks an APlib-compressed Ursnif DLL. This DLL\n(e3d89b564e57e6f1abba05830d93fa83004ceda1dbc32b3e5fb97f25426fbda2) is not known\non VirusTotal as of 2020-04-17.\n\nBefore I continue with the analysis of the DLL, let me note that the techniques that the actor\nutilizes in their cascade of obfuscated layers ensure very low detection rates of their tools\nwithin the first days.\n\n## Dissecting LOLSnif\n\nThe DLL that I unpacked in the previous section is part of a recent fork of Ursnif, which I will\nrefer to as LOLSnif in the following. LOLSnif comprises two main components: the loader\nand the worker component. The first drops the latter. Both are PE DLLs with slightly broken\nheaders, where the DOS header magic number (“MZ”) as well as the PE header magic\nnumber (“PE”) are overwritten. While this may hinder some sandbox solutions to properly\ndump the payloads, this can be easily fixed. Notably both are x86 binaries. During my\nresearch I did not find any x64 binaries related to this malware.\n\n### The Loader\n\n\n-----\n\nThe unpacked DLL\n(e3d89b564e57e6f1abba05830d93fa83004ceda1dbc32b3e5fb97f25426fbda2) comprises\ntwo exports: the DLL entry point and DllRegisterserver that is required for DLL registration\nwith regsvr32. It resembles an Ursnif loader and uses the same configuration mechanism (JJ\nstructure).\n\nThe following screenshots illustrates a JJ structure right beneath the section listing of the PE\nheader. Each configuration section starts off with the magic number 0x4A4A (“JJ”) and holds\nan offset to the data as well as a CRC32 tag to describe the data type (e.g. additional\n[payload). A profound introduction into the configuration format of Ursnif can be found here.](https://labs.sentinelone.com/writing-malware-configuration-extractors-isfb-ursnif/)\n\nJJ structure\n\nThe loader comprises two configuration sections. The first section is an “INSTALL_INI” that is\nrequired to install the payload of the second section. The second section contains an APlibcompressed DLL that is the actual worker. Before this second DLL is unpacked the loader\nchecks whether the operating system has a Russian or Chinese localization. If so, then the\nloader silently stops its operation.\n\n### The Worker\n\nLOLSnif’s worker still resembles an original Ursnif worker. For instance, the general structure\nof the project is still preserved. This includes peculiarities like the configuration storage using\nJJ structures and the encrypted “.bss” section that holds strings and other data that deserves\nprotection. Although there are some slight changes to the encryption algorithm. However,\nthere are several interesting enhancements that I will detail later on.\n\nIts configuration format is the same as its ancestor. The following screenshot shows a\nconfiguration blob that is highlighted with colors. Its first part compromises structures with\noffsets to strings and information on the data type. At the end of the blob (grey area) are\nthese strings stored. For instance, the area highlighted in blue contains the command and\ncontrol server addresses. This area is followed by a list of public DNS server. Notably this\nblob contains configuration parameters for a DGA (Domain Generation Algorithm), e.g. the\ndomain where to download keywords for domain generation (constitution[.]org). However,\nLOLSnif does not comprise any functionality to generate domain names.\n\nConfiguration blob\n\nAs its ancestor Ursnif, LOLSnif comes with a encrypted “.bss” section that holds, for\nexample, strings. This section is decrypted on startup. However, the decryption algorithm\ndiffers slightly from the original code base. The following screenshot depicts the decryption\nalgorithm. The decryption key is still based on the sample’s compilation date, which is hardcoded in the binary. However, there are some modifications to this key. Also, the original\nUrsnif utilized a rolling XOR algorithm, where LOLSnif’s algorithm is based on add / sub\n[instructions The full list of decrypted strings can be found in Appendix B (pdf 121 5 KB)](https://www.telekom.com/resource/blob/600078/0a7581ca22c85e654a49eeb2cd302c02/dl-20200511-lolsnif-appendix-b-en-data.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\nDecryption algorithm\n\nFurthermore, some strings do not have references. Hence, they are dead and not needed.\nWhile this may be an issue with the disassembler, this is rather an issue with the code. The\nstrings are defined in Ursnif's code as macros (see header file “Common/cschar.h”).\nTherefore, the authors of the malware must keep track of them. This may suggest that this\nfunctionality is not yet implemented, or the author forgot to clean up all unused functionality\nlike in the DGA example.\n\nThe interaction with the registry is implemented in two ways: via native Win32 APIs (e.g.\nRegOpenKey, RegEnumKey, RegCloseKey) and via Windows Management Instrumentation\n(WMI). There are wrapper functions that take a Boolean argument in order to decide whether\nto use the Win32 API or WMI. For instance, the following screenshot shows a wrapper\nfunction for setting a string value of a registry key. The first argument (annotated as\n“use_wmi” in the disassembly) determines the use of native API or WMI.\n\nWrapper function\n\nLOLSnif seems to be only built for x86. However, it clearly anticipates that it will run on x64\nplatforms as well. For instance, it utilizes the flag “__ProviderArchitecture” to request data\nfrom [a 64 bit WMI provider as an 32 bit application.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wmisdk/requesting-wmi-data-on-a-64-bit-platform)\n\nAnother interesting aspect is that LOLSnif makes extensive use of COM interfaces. It was\nreported that this malware instruments the Internet Explorer via IWebBrowser in order to\ncontact its Command and Control servers (CC). This tactic allows it to bypass any proxy\nconfiguration in a cooperate network since Internet Explorer typically knows how to talk to\nthe proxy. LOLSnif anticipates that there might be invalid certificate warnings since it\nsearches in the DOM via IHTMLElement for the string “invalidcert”. If it encounters this string,\nthen it confirms the warning to send the payload to the CC server. However, the current\nsample does not utilize https but rather plain http. Furthermore, the malware sets Internet\nExplorer as standard browser in order to avoid any popups during operation.\n\n[This Ursnif variant makes use of LOLBins (as also pointed out in this blog). For instance,](https://thedfirreport.com/2020/04/24/ursnif-via-lolbins/)\nLOLBins are utilized to start the malware from the registry (mshta.exe + powershell.exe).\nFurthermore, LOLSnif is capable of download and execute further modules as well as\n[payloads. For instance, a recent blog post mentions that the associated actor dropped a](https://thedfirreport.com/2020/04/24/ursnif-via-lolbins/)\nCobalt Strike BEACON as well as a legitimate TeamViewer VNC client.\n\n## Zooming Out: Tracking LOLSnif’s /api1 Activity Throughout the Last Months\n\nBased on the campaign that I observed in April 2020, I pivoted to track LOLSnif activity\nthroughout the last months. There are several links we can leverage to find more samples\n[and domains. Appendix A (pdf, 93.0 KB) lists all IoCs that I found during my investigation.](https://www.telekom.com/resource/blob/600076/ff2f4f0adcfcef604c1f8aa0c3a615e2/dl-20200511-lolsnif-appendix-a-en-data.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\nFirst, the string decryption algorithm of LOLSnif differs from the original code base.\nTherefore, I hunted for more samples based on this algorithm. This yielded several samples\nfrom which I was able to extract the configuration. The following table shows the unique\nconfigurations that I was able to find.\n\n\nHash (SHA256\nprefix)\n\n\nBotnet\nID\n\n\nServer\nID\n\n\nSerpent Key Compilation Timestamp\n\n\n8d700ea 1000 730 W7fx3j0lFvOxT2kF Thu Oct 31 14:55:25\n2019 UTC\n\nc206f90 2000 730 W7fx3j0lFvOxT2kF Wed Dec 4 16:56:24\n2019 UTC\n\n7307f15 3000 730 W7fx3j0lFvOxT2kF Wed Feb 19 11:18:20\n2020 UTC\n\nf48e634 2000 730 U7yKaYwFde7YtppY Wed Feb 19 11:18:24\n2020 UTC\n\n8ffe59d 3000 730 W7fx3j0lFvOxT2kF Wed Apr 1 17:32:33\n2020 UTC\n\nAll samples share the same server ID (730) and the same RSA key (not listed here). There\nare three botnet IDs (1000, 2000, 3000) that follow an increasing pattern with each\ncampaign. Their compilation timestamps seem to be legit. All but the last share the domain\n”wensa[.]at” or a subdomain of it. As we later will see, the actor utilized this domain for\nroughly six months. The serpent CBC key is “W7fx3j0lFvOxT2kF” in all cases but one. This\noutlier belongs to the botnet ID 2000, which has the key “U7yKaYwFde7YtppY”. Interestingly,\nthere are two samples that were compiled within four seconds on 2020-02-19, which\nsuggests that there is some form of build automation.\n\nAnother way is to pivot on the CC infrastructure. First, all samples use “/api1” as part of their\nURLs, e.g. “been.dianer[.]at/api1”. Second, all domains but one uses the “.at” TLD. There is\none TOR “.onion” domain “6buzj3jmnvrak4lh.onion”. If we utilize passive DNS information\nregarding the already known domains / IPs, then we find further interesting information.\nThere are many domains that the associated actor utilized for several months. The domain\n“wensa[.]at” was probably utilized for the longest time, roughly six months.\n\nThe following timeline shows the unique configurations and some of the domains. The\nsamples are described by their SHA256 prefix and their serpent CBC key prefix, e.g.\n8d700ea W7. The domains have a first seen date (FS) and some of them a last seen date\n\n\n-----\n\n(LS). The domains lamanak[.]at and kamalak[.]at that the actor probably registered at the\nvery beginning of their operation are still from time to time associated with IPs of their\ninfrastructure. Furthermore, I suppose that the aforementioned wensa[.]at domain was\nreplaced by the pipen[.]at domain in March 2020.\n\nTimeline\n\nThe associated actor does either not care about OpSec or is very sure of their capabilities\nsince they are reusing domains and IPs several times and they utilize them sometimes for\nvery long periods of time.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this blog, I’ve scrutinized a recent Ursnif variant to which I refer as LOLSnif and its recent\nactivity. The associated actor possibly conducts targeted cybercrime operations that are still\nongoing. At the heart of these campaigns is a variant of the Ursnif Trojan that was\nrepurposed as a downloader and reconnaissance tool to meet the actor’s special needs.\n\nThe techniques utilized by this actor such as LOLBins, heavy obfuscation, as well as COM\ninterfaces and the TTPs observed by others in later stages of an attack such as utilization of\npost exploitation frameworks (Cobalt Strike) and VNC clients (TeamViewer) suggest that this\nactor is involved in targeted attacks. The attacks are ongoing since month without much\npublic attention. This maybe the reason why the associated actor reuses domains and IPs\nover and over again.\n\nNevertheless, this actor should not be overlooked and maybe more data in the future (e.g.\nfrom Incident Response Engagements) helps to shed some light on the ultimate goal of this\nactor.\n\n### Appendix A: IoCs (pdf, 93.0 KB)\n\n Appendix B: Full Dump of Decrypted Strings (pdf, 121.5 KB)\n\n[More informationCybersecurity: TA505’s Box of Chocolate](https://www.telekom.com/en/blog/group/article/cybersecurity-ta505-s-box-of-chocolate-597672)\n\n[Cybersecurity: Dissecting Emotet - part one](https://www.telekom.com/en/blog/group/article/cybersecurity-dissecting-emotet-part-one-592612)\n\n[Cybersecurity: Dissecting Emotet - part two](https://www.telekom.com/en/blog/group/article/cybersecurity-dissecting-emotet-part-two-596128)\n\n[Media information: Telekom presents current figures on cyber security](https://www.telekom.com/en/media/media-information/archive/telekom-presents-current-figures-on-cyber-security-573050)\n\n[Media information: The Global Guardian never sleeps](https://www.telekom.com/en/media/media-information/archive/the-global-guardian-never-sleeps-582556)\n\n\n-----",
