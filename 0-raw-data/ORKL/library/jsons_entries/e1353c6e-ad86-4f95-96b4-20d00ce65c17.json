    "plain_text": "**REPORT**\n# Operation 99\n\n## North Korean State Sponsored Supply Chain Attack on Tech Innovation\n\n\n## Executive Summary\n\n**The SecurityScorecard STRIKE team has uncovered an ongoing cyberattack targeting software developers, orchestrated by**\n**the Lazarus Group, a North Korean state-sponsored hacking unit. Identified on January 9th and named Operation 99, this**\n**campaign builds on tactics seen in past Lazarus operations, such as the 2021 Operation Dream Job, but with a sharper focus**\n\n**on infiltrating development environments.**\n\n**Unlike the fake job descriptions aimed at defense contractors in Operation Dream Job, Operation 99 targets developers in**\n**Web3 and cryptocurrency fields. Attackers pose as recruiters on platforms like LinkedIn, enticing victims with project tests or**\n**code reviews. Victims are tricked into cloning malicious Git repositories that connect to a command-and-control (C2) server,**\n**initiating a series of data-stealing implants.**\n\n**Once deployed, these implants extract source code, secrets, cryptocurrency wallet keys, and other sensitive data from**\n**development environments. This campaign emphasizes the increasing risk to developers in high-stakes industries, where**\n**intellectual property and digital assets are prime targets for the purpose of financial gains.**\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n### Sophisticated Targeting of Developers\n\n**The Lazarus Group is targeting software developers with a specialized focus on those seeking freelance work in Web3 and**\n**cryptocurrency sectors. Unlike previous campaigns like Operation Dream Job, which targeted job seekers with fake job**\n**descriptions, Operation 99 lures developers with coding projects tied to fake recruitment schemes. Attackers create deceptive**\n**LinkedIn profiles and direct victims to clone malicious GitLab repositories. These repositories exploit the trust of victims,**\n**compromising their systems and enabling the theft of high-value data.**\n\n**This tactic demonstrates a deliberate evolution in Lazarus Group’s strategy, shifting from broad phishing attempts to targeted**\n**attacks on a critical link in the tech supply chain: developers.**\n\n### Multi-Stage Malware with Modular Design\n\n**The attackers use a layered malware delivery system with modular components that adapt to different targets. Downloaders**\n**like Main99 retrieve and execute payloads such as Payload 99/73, brow99/73, and MCLIP, which perform tasks including:**\n\n**•** **Keylogging and clipboard monitoring.**\n\n**•** **File exfiltration from development environments.**\n\n**•** **Browser credential theft.**\n\n**This modular framework enables the malware to function across multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.**\n**By embedding the malware into developer workflows, the attackers aim to compromise not only individual victims but also the**\n**projects and systems they contribute to.**\n\n\n-----\n\n### Advanced Command and Control (C2) Infrastructure\n\n**The campaign uses sophisticated C2 infrastructure hosted at Stark Industries LLC to deploy payloads and maintain control**\n**over compromised systems. These servers use heavily obfuscated Python scripts, often compressed with ZLIB, to evade**\n**detection. The infrastructure dynamically tailors malware for specific targets, ensuring compatibility with the victim’s operating**\n**system and environment.**\n\n**This adaptability demonstrates the Lazarus Group’s technical capability to execute precise attacks, making detection and**\n**mitigation significantly more challenging.**\n\n### Focused Theft of Developer and Cryptocurrency Data\n\n**The malware specifically targets data from software development environments, including:**\n\n**•** **Source code.**\n\n**•** **Secrets and configuration files.**\n\n**•** **Cryptocurrency-related assets like wallet keys and mnemonics.**\n\n**By compromising developer accounts, attackers not only exfiltrate intellectual property but also gain access to cryptocurrency**\n**wallets, enabling direct financial theft. The targeted theft of private and secret keys could lead to millions in stolen digital**\n**assets, furthering the Lazarus Group’s financial goals.**\n\n**The customization of payloads for high-value targets reflects a strategic intent to exploit the intersection of technology and**\n**cryptocurrency, aligning with the group’s history of using stolen data to fund North Korea’s regime.**\n\n### Campaign\n\n**By analyzing netflow data, the STRIKE team has been able to identify impacted victims across the globe, highlighting the**\n**extensive reach of this campaign.**\n\n**Global Impacted Victims**\n\n**This time, the impersonation involves a fake recruiter falsely claiming to represent COIN Property for a cryptocurrency-related**\n**project. However, the supposed recruiter does not exist. As of January 10th, the fraudulent LinkedIn profile has been taken**\n**down and is no longer accessible.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**This time, the impersonation involves a fake recruiter falsely claiming to represent COIN Property for a cryptocurrency-related**\n**project. However, the supposed recruiter does not exist. As of January 10th, the fraudulent LinkedIn profile has been taken**\n**down and is no longer accessible.**\n\n**Fake Recruiter Profile**\n\n**We also observed the adversary impersonating the COO at Cowchain sending a follow up email from the email**\n**cowchain610@gmail.com.**\n\n**The repository masquerades as the codebase for a coin voting and promotion system purportedly associated with the**\n**company COIN Property. The README file further instructs victims to clone a GitLab repository named \"coin promoting**\n**Webapp.\"**\n\n**This analysis delves deeper into the broader context, uncovering the tactics and implants used to target developers. Building**\n**on our investigation of a similar campaign from a few months ago, this research explores the capabilities of these implants,**\n**their methods of targeting, and how they extract data from infected victims.**\n\n\n-----\n\n### Comparison to October Attack\n\n**[STRIKE analyzed a campaign that was conducted against Software Developers back in October 2024. This attack is similar](https://securityscorecard.com/blog/inside-a-north-korean-phishing-operation-targeting-devops-employees/)**\n**to the previous campaign that used C2 servers with component downloads over port 1224. However the previous operation,**\n**while it used similar TTPs, we did notice the delivery and obfuscation to be very different.**\n\n**For example the file downloaded from the BROW end-point**\n**(see the analysis later) is different between the October 2024 attack**\n**and Jan 2025 attack. We won’t compare every function or every**\n**component from the previous attack, but highlight some of the**\n**differences. Functionally, they accomplish the same thing, however**\n**some of their techniques differ. The decoded BROW file for October**\n**also does not utilize sType and gType values for campaign and**\n**variants.**\n\n\n**In the October file the hostname function for the C2 is different and**\n**it obfuscates the C2 address, while the latest attack uses that is**\n**clear text.**\n\n**In the October campaign the implant implemented a self destruction**\n**mechanism, which is not present in this latest attack.**\n\n### C2 Infrastructure Analysis\n\n\n**October Campaign**\n\n**Implant self destruction**\n\n\n**When the code from the repository is executed, it establishes a connection to the IP address 5[.]253[.]43[.]122, which is**\n**hosted by the provider Stark Industries Solutions Ltd. The domain it resolves to is vm3462807.stark-industries.solutions,**\n**indicating that its a VM. This IP address hosts an Apache server configured to deliver various payloads, which appear to be**\n**intended as the second-stage execution on the victim's machine.**\n\n**Based on the scan data from our Internet collections this is a Windows machine running an Apache hence the directory**\n**exposure leak observed later in our analysis. The server appeared to contain a directory D:\\backend+server\\assets\\payload\\**\n**which is interesting as there may be custom backend server code that is running the operations and enabling interaction with**\n**victims.**\n\n**Furthermore, interacting with the server over port 1224 reveals behavior consistent with serving targeted payloads.**\n**Specifically, querying the server results in payloads named in the format pay5346_<numeric>. While no results were returned**\n**for the numeric suffix 30, we successfully downloaded pay5346_31 and pay5346_32 as well as many others that had a similar**\n**naming convention.**\n\n**Payload not found, but reveals some information about the directory**\n\n\n-----\n\n**In other directories there were obfuscated scripts following the same pattern main5346_221_<numeric>, that was found**\n**with the payload scripts. These directory paths and naming conventions all tie into campaign and version identifiers. So for**\n**example 5346 may be a version and 221 is a sub-variant, later we see in the analysis that these values are configured in the**\n**scripts. The server doesn’t have directory traversal enabled, rather the backend is set up to deliver specific payloads if you**\n**know the exact path.**\n\n**Additionally, we successfully downloaded a script called main5346_224, which contains a heavily obfuscated Base64 string**\n**compressed using ZLIB.**\n\n**Main script not found, but reveals some information about the directory**\n\n**The actual python script being returned by the server is an obfuscated script loader, below is just a short example of what this**\n**function looks like. The base64 string in this script is reversed (the order of the characters are backwards) in order to obfuscate**\n**and make it harder for analysis. The input to this script is the large base64 block which it then reverses it, decodes the base64,**\n**de-compresses it using ZLIB and finally executes the resulting output on the target system.**\n\n\n#### _ = lambda __ : __import__('zlib').decompress(__import__('base64'). b64decode(__[::-1]));exec((_)(b'==Qd1IcSf8/fffu/adrfcIp3opDuzpv'))\n\n\n**To further complicate matters the script is encoded at a depth of 65 layers, each stage decodes an additional compressed**\n**reverse order base64 string. The final resulting file is a human readable Python script which is the actual malware. We**\n**discovered (as covered later in the analysis) the original function used to obfuscate the payloads and components. We will**\n**describe its behavior here and how it works.**\n\n**Original Obfuscator function**\n\n\n-----\n\n**The string RandVar = ? is replaced with a Randomized value.**\n\n**The input script data is repeatedly obfuscated using a combination**\n**of ZLIB compression, base64 encoding and string reversal.**\n\n**The general steps it takes**\n\n**•** **The scripts data is encoded into UTF-8 bytes**\n\n**•** **The bytes are compressed with ZLIB**\n\n**•** **The compressed bytes are base64 encoded**\n\n**•** **The resulting base64 string is string reversed**\n\n**The obfuscation process is applied multiple times in a loop. Each**\n**layer wraps the previous one in an exec statement so the obfuscated**\n\n**script will unwrap itself. At the end it results in a script that can**\n**unpack itself, deobfuscate and execute final payload.**\n\n**Since the obfuscation method was unknown and this code was**\n**also obfuscated, STRIKE developed a script to decode the multiple**\n**layers. By analyzing the Python scripts, we can identify aspects**\n**of the code that provide insights into the methods and content**\n**delivered to the victim.**\n\n### Delivery of Payloads\n\n\n**Obfuscation loop**\n\n**Resulting script**\n\n\n**Once you have decoded the Python scripts there are two variables hardcoded. These variables contain the main version and**\n**sub-variant. Our hypothesis is that the malicious git repo contained one of these initial downloaders.**\n\n**The sType and gType variables in pay99_71.py for example are used as parameters to customize the HTTP GET requests to**\n**the C2 server. They form part of the URL path (e.g., /payload/99/71), allowing the attacker to identify the campaign (sType)**\n**and specify the target group, payload type, or version (gType). These parameters enable the C2 server to deliver tailored**\n**payloads based on the context provided by the script, making the attack more dynamic and adaptable. This mechanism**\n**also allows attackers to manage different payloads and campaigns without modifying the script, enhancing the flexibility and**\n**scalability of their operations.**\n\n### Implant Analysis\n**Main5346**\n\n**We analyzed the downloaded file main5346_224.py, which was heavily obfuscated and compressed to around 65 layers,**\n**ultimately yielding a downloader. This framework shares significant similarities with Main99, functioning as a modular**\n**downloader. The script appears to exist in multiple versions, differentiated by the sType and gType values, with two distinct**\n**variations identified so far: 5346 and 99. It constructs URLS dynamically using the sType and gType values. In this case there**\n**are three different components downloaded and executed from the C2 server.**\n\n**•** **Payload: Endpoint /payload/5346/224**\n\n**•** **Browse: Endpoint /brow/5346/224**\n\n**•** **Mclip: Endpoint /mclip/5346/224**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Notably, the framework is designed to detect the operating system of the target device (macOS or Windows) and dynamically**\n**download the appropriate payload, showcasing its adaptability and platform-specific targeting capabilities.**\n\n**Opening function from main5346_224.py with Payload downloader**\n\n**sType and gType configurations**\n\n**Downloader function for MCLIP and BROW**\n\n\n-----\n\n### Main99\n\n**Main99 is a variant of Main5346.**\n\n**Main99 is a modular downloader malware designed to retrieve and execute additional payloads from a Command and Control**\n**(C2) server at 5.253.43.122. Main99 relies entirely on the functionality of the downloaded modules, making it simpler and**\n**more lightweight. It specifically retrieves three distinct payloads (payload, brow, and mclip) and executes them, storing files**\n**in a hidden directory (~/.n2) for persistence. Main99 acts purely as a downloader, with no direct malicious actions, but its**\n**structured approach suggests it is part of a broader and more coordinated malware delivery system.**\n\n**The script communicates with a remote server at http://5.253.43.122:1224 to fetch and execute payloads based on**\n**predefined identifiers. It uses HTTP requests to specific endpoints (/payload, /brow, /mclip) to download malicious files, stores**\n**them in a hidden directory, and executes them stealthily on the target system.**\n\n**The script has three functions—download_payload, download_browse, and download_mclip—each responsible for**\n\n**downloading files from specific endpoints (/payload, /brow, /mclip) on the remote server. After downloading, it executes**\n**the files stealthily using subprocess.Popen. This process ensures the malicious payloads are fetched and run without user**\n**consent or notification.**\n\n**Main Code indicating C2**\n\n**The primary payload downloader function is outlined below. This function is responsible for downloading the**\n**pay<numeric>_<numeric>.py script and executing it on the target system. It includes logic to determine whether the operating**\n**system is macOS and adjusts its behavior accordingly.**\n\n**Payload Download function**\n\n\n-----\n\n### Payload5346\n\n**A component downloaded (pay5346_224.py) by**\n**Main5346 and executed as the primary payload. This**\n**implant performs system data collection (OS details,**\n**hostname, version, username and UUID). This implant**\n**communicates to a remote server over ports 1224**\n**and 2242 which are hardcoded into the implant code.**\n**The implant uses HTTP requests to send data to**\n**the server and retrieve commands. The attacker can**\n**interact in real-time with the infected systems through**\n**a persistent connection.**\n\n**Some of the endpoints it will interact with.**\n\n**•** **/keys: Sends system and network information.**\n\n**•** **/uploads: Uploads files from the victim's**\n**machine.**\n\n**•** **/brow: Downloads additional payloads.**\n\n**Function to send collected system information to the**\n**C2.**\n\n**There is also a function to search for sensitive files and**\n**upload them to a C2.**\n\n**This function shown below copies the clipboard and**\n**sends it via commands such as SSH_CLIP to the C2.**\n\n**Run Copy Clipboard**\n\n\n**Function to send system information to C2**\n\n**Function to upload a file**\n\n**Searching for sensitive files**\n\n\n-----\n\n**SSH clip function**\n\n**The implant also has the capability of receiving and executing arbitrary commands from the C2, indicating more than just data**\n**exfiltration. It creates a persistent connection over port 2242 to maintain a persistent connection with the victim.**\n\n**Persistent client connection function**\n\n**The following function will listen for commands from the self.cmds dictionary.**\n\n**Listening function**\n\n\n-----\n\n**The commands are mapped in the Shell class using the self.cmds dictionary. Each integer represents a command code,**\n**mapped to a corresponding handler function. What commands can the actual implant receive? There are several commands**\n\n**Extracted command dictionary from Shell function**\n\n**The shell function for commands**\n\n\n-----\n\n**it can receive from the C2.**\n\n**SSH_OBJ can execute arbitrary commands on the infected system (cd, ls, dir). Can run programs or scripts. Sends the**\n**output back to the C2 server.**\n\n**1.** **SSH_CMD terminates all Python processes on the infected machine.**\n\n**2.** **SSH_CLIP sends the clipboard data stored in the e_buf value to the C2.**\n\n**3.** **SSH_RUN downloads and executes a payload from the /brow endpoint on the C2**\n\n**4.** **SSH_UPLOAD handles file uploads to the C2 server**\n\n**5.** **SSH_KILL terminates specific browsers (chrome and brave)**\n\n**6.** **SSH_ANY downloads and executes a specific tool (AnyDesk) or payload from /adc endpoint**\n\n**7.** **SSH_ENV searches and uploads environment related files (API keys, passwords,secret, config, etc)**\n\n**The implant has the capability of executing 3rd stage payloads via the BROW endpoint. The URL is constructed dynamically**\n**based on sType and gType values such as /brow/<sType>/<gType>.**\n\n**Function to download 3rd stage payload**\n\n**The following function describes the execution logic of the implant determining multi platform such as Windows, MacOS**\n**and Linux.**\n\n**Payload execution function**\n\n\n-----\n\n### Payload 99_31, Payload99_71 & Payload99_73\n\n**A component downloaded (pay99_31.py & pay99_71) by Main99 and executed as the primary payload. This payload is**\n**functionally the same as pay5346_224.py that was downloaded by Main5346. The only difference is sType and gType**\n**variables that indicate campaigns and target groups that we are speculating. Furthermore, pay99_73.py is also functionally**\n**the same as pay5346_224.py.**\n\n### Brow 99_73\n\n**We were able to successfully download brow99_73.py from the /brow end-point on the C2 server. This is downloaded in the**\n**payload main functions via the brow_down function.**\n\n**We will provide an analysis here of the implant and its capabilities and how it is different from the other pay files. This script**\n**downloaded was particularly interesting as it contained two implants at different stages of the de-obfuscation process.**\n**The first implant was successfully decoded after stage 65 and the implant is designed to target browsers and extract**\n**sensitive information. The implant brow99 targets MacOS, Linux and Windows and contains functions to both extract saved**\n**passwords, but also to decrypt them as well.**\n\n**This implant targets major browsers and will extract the encrypted password content.**\n\n**Function to extract the content from these Browsers**\n\n\n-----\n\n**The implant has the capability of decrypting the passwords for various operating system browsers. The following is the**\n**function to get the encryption key for Windows based browsers. It is using the Windows API win32crypt.CryptUnprotectData**\n**to decrypt the Browsers master key.**\n\n**Get encryption key for Windows**\n\n**On Windows, decryption will involve extracting the AES key, deriving the initial vector (IV) and decrypting the data using AES-**\n**GCM or the CryptrUnprotectData function. The following is the function that performs this.**\n\n**Windows Browser password decryption.**\n\n**The process for Linux based systems is a bit different and the keys are accessed in a different manner. The implant will get the**\n**encryption key from GNOME keyring via secretstorage. The following function will get the encryption key for the browser.**\n\n**Get encryption key for Linux based Browsers**\n\n\n-----\n\n**On Linux machines, the process to decrypt a password involves reading from the Login Data from the SQLite DB. It will then**\n**perform decryption using AES.**\n\n**Decrypt Linux Browser Passwords**\n\n**The decryption process for MacOS is the same as Linux, however extracting the encryption key is a bit different. The saved**\n\n**password will be retrieved from the keychain using the security command.**\n\n**MacOS get encryption key**\n\n**The saved password is processed using PBKDF2 to derive the AES key. The following is the function that will decrypt the**\n**keychain to an AES key.**\n\n**MacOS Keychain Decryption**\n\n\n-----\n\n**The following function will prepare the data to be sent to the C2 server. Further it will format the encrypted data into a human**\n**readable string.**\n\n**Function to prepare data for C2**\n\n**The implant will combine the decrypted data (self.pretty_print) with the browsers file path to create a content string (cc). This is**\n**an example of what the content could look like for the variable CC**\n\n**Example**\n\n**This function described above is called to assemble the data into a human readable string to be sent to the C2.**\n\n**Format the decrypted data into human readable**\n\n**Finally the implant is sending the data via HTTP post to the C2 based on the hardcoded host values.**\n\n**Hardcoded C2 hosts**\n\n\n-----\n\n### MCLIP\n\n**The MCLIP implant (mclip15_99.py) was successfully obtained from the C2 server which is downloaded by Main99 and**\n**Main5346. The main functionalities of this code is keyboard and clipboard monitoring and exfiltration. The C2 server is**\n**also different, but also hosted at the same provider (Stark Industries LLC). This c2 appears to be specifically established**\n**to interact with this MCLIP implant. This implant communicates over port 1224 to 95[.]164[.]7[.]171 and is configured to**\n**use sType 15 and gType 99 which appears to be part of the 99 operation. The following is an analysis of this implant and its**\n**general capabilities. The code is organized into two parts, keyboard hooking, logging and transmission to C2 and similarly for**\n**clipboard.**\n\n**The following is the function to hook the keyboard and monitor keyboard activity.**\n\n**Keyboard hooking process**\n\n**The implant will save the data and send it to the C2 server via the /api/clip endpoint. The following is the function that will save**\n**the captured data and send it to the C2.**\n\n\n-----\n\n### Unknown Code\n\n**Later in the obfuscated script (brow15_99.py) after encoding stage 115 is another rather large sophisticated Python implant,**\n**which appears to be incomplete and cut-off. What’s interesting is the Python script contains the original obfuscator that was**\n**used to create the obfuscation on the files downloaded from the C2.**\n\n**Obfuscation Function**\n\n**The implant appears to be getting some payload from XOR encrypted Pastebin URLs.**\n\n**Function to decode the URLs**\n\n**Further, it makes a bunch of references to a TSUNAMI payload which STRIKE hasn’t analyzed, and its role is unknown. It**\n**decodes an array of URLs using the following XOR which in return presents a bunch of Pastebin URLs.**\n\n**XOR encryption function**\n\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**The ongoing \"Operation 99\" campaign orchestrated by the Lazarus Group exemplifies the increasing sophistication and**\n**adaptability of state-sponsored cyber threats. By targeting software developers interested in Web3 and cryptocurrency**\n**sectors, the attackers exploit a critical link in the technology supply chain. Their use of fake recruitment schemes, malicious**\n**Git repositories, and modular malware frameworks underscores their strategic focus on high-value data, including source**\n**code, configuration files, and cryptocurrency credentials.**\n\n**The campaign's reliance on obfuscated, multi-stage implants and dynamic payload delivery highlights the advanced**\n**capabilities of the adversary. The identified Command and Control (C2) infrastructure further demonstrates their ability to tailor**\n**attacks across different operating systems while maintaining operational stealth.**\n\n**This campaign not only reaffirms the persistent threat posed by the Lazarus Group but also serves as a stark reminder of the**\n**vulnerabilities within developer ecosystems. As these attacks evolve, it is critical for organizations and developers to adopt**\n**proactive security measures, including enhanced code repository verification, robust endpoint defenses, and heightened**\n**vigilance against social engineering tactics. The STRIKE team's findings contribute valuable insights into mitigating these**\n**complex threats and safeguarding the technology community against future attacks.**\n\n\n-----",
