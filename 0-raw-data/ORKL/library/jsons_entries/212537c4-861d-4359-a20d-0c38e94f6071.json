REvil affiliates can collect up to 70 percent of the ransom payment while\nREvil operators collect the rest. This is how REvil has historically operated its ransomwareas-a-service model.\n\n## How REvil allegedly cuts out affiliates according to… its former affiliates\n\nREvil, a sophisticated Russian-speaking ransomware group, frequently works with affiliates\nwho provide them with access to networks—and negotiate with victims on REvil’s behalf—for\na cut of the ransom. REvil affiliates can collect up to 70 percent of the ransom payment while\nREvil operators collect the rest. This is how REvil has historically operated its ransomwareas-a-service model.\n\n\n-----\n\nREvil s tactics have recently come under renewed scrutiny. Threat actors operating on XSS\nand Exploit are currently reacting to evidence that REvil included a secret backdoor in its\nransomware code—allegedly enabling the ransomware group to steal illicit ransom proceeds\nfrom its affiliates.\n\nOn September 20, a threat actor allegedly unearthed a “cryptobackdoor” in REvil’s sample\ncode and posted the finding on Exploit, an illicit high-tier Russian-language forum. The\nbackdoor code enables REvil the capability of restoring encrypted files on its own—without\nthe involvement of the affiliates it originally hired.\n\n[Flashpoint analysts note that the backdoor was likely exposed months ago. However, the](https://twitter.com/fwosar/status/1411281334870368260?s=20)\nSeptember 20 leak represents what appears to be the first time concrete evidence of REvil’s\ntactics have been made public.\n\n[REvil can also allegedly hijack chats with victims and cut off discussions with its affiliates in](https://threatpost.com/how-revil-may-have-ripped-off-its-own-affiliates/174887/)\norder to collect full shares of the ransom without sharing the proceeds.\n\nThe subsequent fallout within the threat actor community offers the very organizations and\nindividuals they target a window into the types of important chatter that can arise in the\ncybercriminal underground; insights into evolving relationships and behavioral codes among\nthreat actors; and lens into whether arbitration is a realistic and viable possibility when\ndealing with major ransomware groups.\n\n## Making sense of the chatter\n\nThe threat actor Signature—who had previously requested US $7 million in an arbitration\ndispute on Exploit—re-hashed their argument after the REvil backdoor was revealed.\n\nAs a result, Signature started a new Exploit thread, saying that they knew all along about\nREvil’s scamming tactics and claiming the revelations lend credence to Signature’s\narbitration claim. With the revelation of the parallel chat and the code backdoor, it is possible\nthat an REvil operator had logged into the Signature chat posing as the victim company and\nabruptly ended the negotiations to collect all the ransom on their parallel chat, just as\nSignature alleged in May.\n\nFlashpoint REvil1Exploit post outlining REvil’s “cryptobackdoor,” taken from the Flashpoint\nplatform. (Image: Flashpoint)\nLockBitSupp, the [LockBit ransomware representative on Exploit, chimed in to say that many](https://www.flashpoint-intel.com/blog/what-does-lockbit-want-decrypting-an-interview-with-the-ransomware-collective/)\nREvil affiliates share suspicion towards REvil.\n\nSome illicit community members reacted with derision to the new evidence presented\nagainst REvil, pointing to a greater internal fissure growing between groups of affiliated\nthreat actors.\n\n\n-----\n\nOne Exploit user said that this is the first time the are hearing of major ransomware groups\nstealing profits from their alleged partners. The user compared REvil’s behavior to scamming\nmethods used by low level carders.\n\nAnother Exploit user said they were tired of “lousy partner programs” used by ransomware\ncollectives “you cannot trust” and further speculated that REvil would survive and thrive\nregardless of whether their reputation takes a real hit among fellow threat actors.\n\nCybersecurity analysts at Flashpoint note that animosity towards ransomware-involved threat\n[actors has been ongoing since high-profile ransomware attacks caused increased law](https://www.flashpoint-intel.com/blog/where-do-cybercriminals-stand-on-ransomware/)\nenforcement scrutiny toward cybercriminal communities.\n\n## Arbitration\n\nOther users have also expressed pessimism regarding the underground community’s ability\nto handle REvil’s alleged behavior. One threat actor on XSS said that “the Devil himself will\nnot be able to figure out” arbitration cases against REvil since the matter has gotten too\ncomplicated—and that arbitration might be prohibited anyway because some forums have\n[purportedly instituted a ransomware ban.](https://www.flashpoint-intel.com/blog/avoslocker-ransomware-advertise-and-recruit/)\n\nAnother threat actor echoed these sentiments that opening up arbitration cases against REvil\nwould be useless, like “arbitrat[ing] against Stalin.”\n\n## Reduce ransomware risk and see Flashpoint intelligence in action\n\nWhen organizations, such as financial institutions and law enforcement agencies, gain\ninsight into the operational dynamics of malicious cybercriminal communities, they can better\nunderstand threat actor TTPs; access potentially vital observations in real-time; leverage that\ninformation to thwart a ransomware attack.\n\n[Sign up for your risk-free 90-day trial and see how Flashpoint can provide you with the](https://www.flashpoint-intel.com/free-trial)\nactionable threat intelligence you and your entire team need to identify and respond to\nthreats targeting your organization. When equipped with Flashpoint Intelligence, your team\nhas immediate access to collections across illicit online communities ranging from private\nforums and illicit marketplaces to encrypted chat services channels to gain insight into threatactor activity on a global scale.\n\n\n-----",
