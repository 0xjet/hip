The announcement, however, was not getting the attention it deserved until Air India, one of SITA's customers, reported a\nmassive passenger data breach on May 21 caused by an earlier attack against SITA. Between March and May, various airline companies,\nincluding Singapore Airlines, Malaysia Airlines, and others, disclosed data breaches. All of those companies were SITA customers.\nAfter Air India revealed the details of its security breach, it became clear that the carriers were most likely dealing with one of the biggest\nsupply chain attacks in the airline industry's history.\n\nUsing its external threat hunting tools, Group-IB's Threat Intelligence team attributed the Air India incident with moderate confidence\nto the Chinese nation-state threat actor known as APT41. The campaign was codenamed ColunmTK.\n\n**In this blog post you will find:**\n\nPreviously unknown details about the ColunmTK campaign\n\nConnections between the SITA security incident and the Air India data breach\n\nEvidence of compromised workstations and exfiltration of 200 MB of data from Air India's network\n\nDescriptions of TTPs used during the ColunmTK campaign\n\nConnections between APT41 and the infrastructure used during the ColunmTK campaign\n\n\n-----\n\nThe potential ramifications of this incident for the entire airline industry and carriers that might yet discover traces of ColunmTK in\ntheir networks are significant. To help companies detect and hunt for ColunmTK, we have provided a full list of indicators of\ncompromise (IOCs) that we retrieved. MITRE ATT&CK, MITRE Shield, and recommendations are available at the end of this blog post.\n\nGroup-IB's Threat Intelligence team informed CERT India and Air India of its findings so that they can take the necessary steps to\nmitigate the threat.\n\n**Background**\n\n[On May 21, Air India, India's flag carrier, published an official statement on their website about a data breach. The announcement](https://www.airindia.in/images/pdf/Data-Breach-Notification.pdf)\nrevealed that the breach was caused by a February incident at the airline's IT service provider, SITA PSS, which is responsible for\nprocessing customers' personally identifiable information (PII). It came to light that the SITA cyberattack affected 4,500,000 data\nsubjects globally, including data related to Air India's customers.\n\nShortly after Air India's public announcement, the database allegedly related to their security breach was put up for sale on an\nunderground market at USD 3,000.\n\n[According to Group-IB's Threat Intelligence & Attribution system, the alleged database was published on a fraudulent resource known](https://www.group-ib.com/intelligence-attribution.html)\nfor reselling data that has been published on various data-leak websites. Because the database had never surfaced anywhere on the dark\nweb, nor in the public domain, Group-IB researchers considered it fake and decided to instead look deeper into what had been known\nabout the actual attack and discovered that the post about listing with Air India's alleged data had nothing to do with what happened in\nreality. Group-IB's Threat Intelligence team soon realized that they were dealing with a sophisticated nation-state threat actor, rather\nthan another financially motivated cybercriminal group.\n**Compromise of Air India's network**\n\nIn mid-February 2021, Group-IB's Threat Intelligence & Attribution system detected infected devices that were part of Air India's\ncomputer network. Starting from at least February 23, 2021, a device inside the company's network communicated with a server with\nthe IP address 185[.]118[.]166[.]66. According to Group-IB's Network Graph, this server has hosted Cobalt Strike, a popular postexploitation framework, since December 11, 2020 (we will come back to it a little later).\n\n\n-----\n\nLifetime of a Cobalt Strike tag in Group-IB's Network Graph\n\nThe patient zero that started communicating with the C&C server was a device named SITASERVER4 with the local IP address\n172[.]16[.]11[.]103. Based on how it is named, it is fair to assume that the device is related to a SITA data processing server.\n\nAfter the attackers established persistence in the network and obtained passwords, they began moving laterally. The threat actor\ncollected information inside the local network, including names of network resources and their addresses.\n\nBelow are examples of commands that were used for lateral movement:\n\n**Date** **Device name** **Command**\n\n\n03/02/21 06:43\nPM\n\n03/03/21 02:05\nAM\n\n\nWEBSERVER3 wmic /node:172.16.2[.]114 /user:[REDACTED] /password:[REDACTED] process call create\n\"c:\\users\\Public\\install.bat\".\n\nAILOAPOTHDT076 ping AILCCUALHSV002.\n\n\nThe results of some commands:\n\n\n**Host**\n\nAILCCUALHSV002\n\n- 172[.]24[.]3[.]24\n\n\n**Shell**\n**Command** **Command Result**\n\nipconfig/all Windows IP Configuration Host Name . . . . . . . . . . . . : AILCCUALHSV002 Primary Dns\nSuffix . . . . . . . : ad[.]airindia[.]in Node Type . . . . . . . . . . . . : Hybrid IP Routing Enabled. . . . .\n. . . : No WINS Proxy Enabled. . . . . . . . : No DNS Suffix Search List. . . . . . : ad[.]airindia[.]in\n\n\n-----\n\n**Host**\n\nAILCCUALHSV001172[.]24[.]3[.]22\n\n\n**Shell**\n**Command** **Command Result**\n\n\nsetspn -T\nad[.]airindia[.]in\n-Q */* | findstr\nSQL\n\n\nMSSQLSvc/AILDELCCPDT011.ad[.]airindia[.]in\nMSSQLSvc/AILDELCCPDT011.ad[.]airindia[.]in:1433\nMSSQLSvc/AILDELCCPDT017.ad[.]airindia[.]in\nMSSQLSvc/AILDELCCPDT017.ad[.]airindia[.]in:1433\nMSSQLSvc/AILDELCCPDT018.ad[.]airindia[.]in\nMSSQLSvc/AILDELCCPDT018.ad[.]airindia[.]in:1433\nMSSQLSvc/AASBOMCGODT009.ad[.]airindia[.]in:1433\nMSSQLSvc/AILDELCCPDT020.ad[.]airindia[.]in\nMSSQLSvc/AILDELCCPDT020.ad[.]airindia[.]in:1433\nMSSQLSvc/AILDELCCPDT023.ad[.]airindia[.]in\nMSSQLSvc/AILDELCCPDT032.ad[.]airindia[.]in:1433\nMSSQLSvc/AILDELCCPDT032.ad[.]airindia[.]in\nMSSQLSvc/AILDELCCPDB01.ad[.]airindia[.]in:17001\nMSSQLSvc/AILDELCCPDB01.ad[.]airindia[.]in:PDWTDSSERVER\nMSSQLSvc/MAAAUCDT614.ad[.]airindia[.]in\nMSSQLSvc/AILMAAAUCDT614.ad[.]airindia[.]in\nMSSQLSvc/AILDELGSDDT406.ad[.]airindia[.]in\nMSSQLSvc/AILBOMAPTDT107.ad[.]airindia[.]in MSSQLSvc/TRCOM.ad[.]airindia[.]in:1433\nMSSQLSvc/ATLDELGSDDT027.ad[.]airindia[.]in\nMSSQLSvc/AILOAPDITDT008.ad[.]airindia[.]in:1433\nMSSQLSvc/AILOAPDITDT008.ad[.]airindia[.]in\nMSSQLSvc/AILDELCCPDT041.ad[.]airindia[.]in\nMSSQLSvc/AILDELCCPDT041.ad[.]airindia[.]in:1433\nMSSQLSvc/AILMAAAUCDT179.ad[.]airindia[.]in\n\n\nThe attackers exfiltrated NTLM hashes and plain-text passwords from local workstations using hashdump and mimikatz.The attackers\ntried to escalate local privileges with the help of BadPotato malware. BadPotatoNet4.exe was uploaded to one of the devices inside the\nvictim's network under the name SecurityHealthSystray.exe. According to our data, at least 20 devices from Air India's network were\ncompromised during the lateral movement stage. The attackers used DNS-txt requests to connect the bots to the C&C server. The\nfollowing domains were used for DNS tunneling.\n\n\n-----\n\nns2[.]colunm[.]tk;\n\nns1[.]colunm[.]tk.\n\nThe name of the campaign, ColunmTK, is derived from these initially discovered domains.\n\nIt was also found that the attackers extracted 23,339,032 bytes of data from the following devices:\n\nSITASERVER4\nAILCCUALHSV001\nAILDELCCPOSCE01\nAILDELCCPDB01\nWEBSERVER3\n\nAccording to Group-IB's Threat Intelligence & Attribution data, the compromised devices were located in different subnets, which may\nindicate that the compromise affected various segments of Air India's network.\n\nAccording to Group-IB's records, the attack on Air India lasted for at least 2 months and 26 days. It took the attackers 24 hours and 5\nminutes to spread Cobalt Strike beacons to other devices in the airline's network.\n\nColunmTK Timeline\n\nThe initial attack vector remains unknown. However, the evidence showing that the first device that started communicating with the\nadversary-controlled C&C server was a SITA server and the fact that SITA notified Air India about its security incident give reasonable\nground to believe that the compromise of Air India's network was the result of a sophisticated supply chain attack, which might have\n[started with SITA. If this conclusion is true, it would affect other SITA customers, which the company claims make up about 90% of the](https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/23/air-india-passenger-data-breach-reveals-sita-hack-worse-than-first-thought/)\nworld's airline businesses.\n**Connections with APT41**\n\n\n-----\n\nGroup-IB researchers believe with moderate confidence that the ColunmTK campaign was carried out by APT41, a prolific Chinesespeaking nation-state threat actor. APT41, also known as WICKED SPIDER (PANDA), Winnti Umbrella, and BARIUM, is believed to\nhave been engaging in state-sponsored espionage in China's interests as well as committing financially motivated cybercrimes.\nAccording to Group-IB's Threat Intelligence & Attribution system, the threat actor has been active since at least 2007.\n\n[APT41 is known for stealing digital certificates for its cyber espionage operations. India is a frequent target of Chinese nation-state](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/prime/technology-and-startups/chinas-state-sponsored-hackers-are-targeting-indias-infrastructure-and-silence-may-not-be-golden-/primearticleshow/82245441.cms)\nadversaries.\n\nWhen analyzing the network infrastructure of the C&C-server involved in the cyberattack against Air India, Group-IB's Threat\nIntelligence & Attribution system revealed that the threat actor used a specific SSL certificate, which was detected on five hosts only.\n\n**IP address** **Location** **ASN** **Organization**\n\n185.118.164[.]198 RU AS44493 Chelyabinsk-Signal LLC\n\n104.224.169[.]214 US AS19181 IT7 Networks Inc\n\n45.61.136[.]199 US AS53667 BL Networks\n\n185.118.166[.]66 RU AS44493 Chelyabinsk-Signal LLC\n\n149.28.134[.]209 SG AS20473 Vultr Holdings, LLC\n\nNetwork relations between hosts with a specific fingerprint presented in Group-IB's Threat Intelligence & Attribution system\n\nLet's take a closer look at these five IP addresses.\n\n[One of them, 45[.]61[.]136[.]199, was attributed to APT41(aka Barium) by Microsoft in their recent research.](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-sentinel/hunting-for-barium-using-azure-sentinel/ba-p/1875913)\n\nIt is worth looking at another IP address from the list: 104[.]224[.]169[.]214. This IP address was used as an A record for two domains:\nserver04[.]dns04[.]com and service04[.]dns04[.]com. The IP address was also used to host the Cobalt Strike framework and shared an\nSSL certificate, b3038101fd0e8b11c519f739f12c7e9b60234d3b, with ColunmTK's IP address 185.118.166[.]66. When analyzing the\n\n\n-----\n\ndns04[.]com subdomains, we found that these domains were parked at the IP address 127.0.0.1 on the same date: April 15, 2021.\nAccording to Group-IB researchers, APT41 usually parks their domains for some time at 127.0.0.1 after their campaigns are over.\n\nNetwork relations between hosts parked at 127.0.0.1.\nSource: Group-IB Threat Intelligence & Attribution\n\nAnother interesting domain is service[.]dns22[.]ml. This domain shared the SSL certificate\nb3038101fd0e8b11c519f739f12c7e9b60234d3b with ColunmTK's IP address and was parked at 127.0.0.1 on January 15, 2021. Security\n[researchers found that the IP address 104[.]224[.]169[.]214 was used as the IP address for a shellcode loader in APT41's earlier](https://ptsecurity.com/ww-en/analytics/pt-esc-threat-intelligence/higaisa-or-winnti-apt-41-backdoors-old-and-new/)\ncampaigns, in which the domain service[.]dns22[.]ml was also used.\n\n[Group-IB researchers discovered a file named \"Install.bat\" (SHA1-7185bb6f1dddca0e6b5a07b357529e2397cdee44).
