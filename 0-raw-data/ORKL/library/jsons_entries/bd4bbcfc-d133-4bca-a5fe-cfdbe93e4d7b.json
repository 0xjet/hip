As a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS)\n[operation, BlackCat can be rented by criminal affiliates to infect and extort targets, with the](https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/ransomware/ransomware-as-a-service-raas/)\nmalware's developers typically getting a cut of the ransom.\n\n\n-----\n\nGiven that the affiliates are individually responsible for compromising their victims systems\nand deploying the actual ransomware binaries, \"it is likely that attacks carried out by the\nsame ransomware family may differ in techniques and procedures,\" Talos's Tiago Pereira\nand Caitlin Huey noted. In other words, affiliates infect victims in different ways with the same\nransomware.\n\nAt the same time, RaaS operators often make training materials, general techniques, and\ntools available to affiliates – as shown by the documents leaked from the Conti ransomware\ngang – so you'd expect to see some similarities in the attacks carried out by these\nmiscreants.\n\nStill, each ransomware strain should have its own command-and-control (C2) systems, and\nyet overlapping C2 resources were seen in BlackMatter and BlackCat infections, fueling\nrumors of strong ties between the two. The Talos team further speculated that \"a BlackMatter\naffiliate was likely an early adopter – possibly in the first month of operation – of BlackCat.\"\n\nThis is interesting because it sheds some light on the interconnected networks of criminals\nmenacing organizations. It's also useful to know what to look out for when defending against\nor gaining early detection of this kind of ransomware.\n\nThose rumors of a close connection began as soon as BlackCat caught the attention of\ncybersecurity vendors and researchers. The MalwareHunter Team [tweeted about the](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam/status/1468713125457371139)\nransomware group in December and other threat intelligence groups, such as S2W out of\nSouth Korea, reported similarities between some of configuration fields used by both\nBlackCat and BlackMatter.\n\nHowever, there also were differences. For instance, BlackCat was written in Rust, while\nransomware from both DarkSide and BlackMatter – the latter a rebranded DarkSide group –\n[were written in C/C++, S2W wrote in an analysis.](https://medium.com/s2wblog/blackcat-new-rust-based-ransomware-borrowing-blackmatters-configuration-31c8d330a809)\n\n**[Speaking of malware... Pradeo says it has spotted an Android app installed more than](https://blog.pradeo.com/spyware-facestealer-google-play)**\n100,000 times from the Google Play Store that has a trojan in it called Facestealer. This\nsocially engineers victims into handing over their Facebook login details, which are passed to\na Russian server. The app in question was Craftsart Cartoon Photo Tools, which has since\nbeen removed by Google. If for some reason you have it installed, get rid of it.\n\n[Mandiant has documented the activities of a team it's called UNC2891 and its targeting of](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/unc2891-overview?s=03)\nSolaris systems with backdoors dubbed TINYSHELL and SLAPSTICK and a rootkit called\nCAKETAP. It is believed CAKETAP was used to alter messages on ATM networks to pull off\nfraudulent withdrawals from banks using bogus payment cards. UNC2891, we're told, is\nskilled on Unix and Linux-flavored machines, is financially motivated, and has gone for years\nundetected in large systems.\n\n[A BlackCat representative in a February interview with Recorded Future said the two groups](https://therecord.media/an-alphv-blackcat-representative-discusses-the-groups-plans-for-a-ransomware-meta-universe/)\nhad a \"connection\" but that BlackCat was not a rebranding of BlackMatter\n\n\n-----\n\nThe representative also said BlackCat is an affiliate of other RaaS groups, and that they took\nknowledge from other outfits. If true, BlackCat is an example of vertical business expansion –\ncontrolling the upstream supply chain by making a service better suited for their needs and\nadding another potential avenue for revenue, the Talos researchers wrote.\n\nVertical expansion also is a business strategy when there is distrust in the supply chain.\n\n\"There are several cases of vulnerabilities in ransomware encryption and even of backdoors\nthat can explain a lack of trust in RaaS,\" they wrote. \"One particular case mentioned by the\nBlackCat representative was a flaw in DarkSide/Blackmatter ransomware allowing victims to\ndecrypt their files without paying the ransom. Victims used this vulnerability for several\nmonths, resulting in big losses for affiliates.\"\n\n### Double blow\n\nBlackCat – also known as ALPHV – is being used in double-ransomware attacks, where the\nfiles not only are encrypted but victims are threatened with public disclosure of the files if the\nransom isn't paid. BlackCat first appeared in November 2021 and has infected several\ncompanies in different parts of the world. That said, more than 30 percent of the\ncompromises have hit US-based companies, according to Talos.\n\nWhen comparing the BlackMatter intrusion in September and the BlackCat one in December,\nthe Talos team believed the pair of cyber-attacks were run by the same affiliate. Both raids\nwent the usual way: an initial compromise followed by exploration and data exfiltration,\npreparation, and then execution of the extortionware.\n\nThere were further similarities: for both the BlackMatter and BlackCat infections, the methods\nto achieve persistence – a reverse SSH tunnel and scheduled tasks – were the same as well\nas lateral movements and the C2 domain. In addition, local and domain user credentials\nwere collected on some key systems by dumping the LSASS process memory and extracting\nthe credentials with Microsoft Sysinternals Procdump and Dumpert.\n\n\"In both attacks, before the actual execution of the ransomware, the attackers performed\nseveral actions preparing systems to make the execution as successful as possible,\" the\nresearchers wrote. \"On the day of the attack, the attacker logged in to the domain controller\nand opened the group policy management interface. The attackers then dropped and\nexecuted a file named 'apply.ps1.' We believe this script created and prepared the group\npolicy to cause the execution of the ransomware throughout the domain.\"\n\nThe researchers admitted they still don't know how tightly related BlackCat is to BlackMatter,\nbut that given the overlapping tools, techniques, and infrastructure of the two infections, they\nhave \"moderate confidence\" that BlackMatter affiliates were probably among the early\nadopters of BlackCat.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs we have seen several times before, RaaS services come and go, they wrote. Their\naffiliates, however, are likely to simply move on to a new service. And with them, many of\ntheir TTPs [techniques, tactics and procedures] are likely to persist.\" ®\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\nBig Tech loves talking up privacy – while trying to kill privacy legislation\n\nStudy claims Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, Microsoft work to derail data rules\n\n[Thomas Claburn in San Francisco Fri 27 May 2022 // 21:48 UTC](https://www.theregister.com/Author/Thomas-Claburn)\nAmazon, Apple, Google, Meta, and Microsoft often support privacy in public\nstatements, but behind the scenes they've been working through some common\norganizations to weaken or kill privacy legislation in US states.\n\n[That's according to a report this week from news non-profit The Markup, which said the](https://themarkup.org/privacy/2022/05/26/tech-industry-groups-are-watering-down-attempts-at-privacy-regulation-one-state-at-a-time)\ncorporations hire lobbyists from the same few groups and law firms to defang or drown\nstate privacy bills.\n\nThe report examined 31 states when state legislatures were considering privacy\nlegislation and identified 445 lobbyists and lobbying firms working on behalf of Amazon,\nApple, Google, Meta, and Microsoft, along with industry groups like TechNet and the\nState Privacy and Security Coalition.\n\n[Continue reading](https://www.theregister.com/2022/05/27/big_tech_privacy/?td=keepreading-btm)\n\n\n-----\n\nSEC probes Musk for not properly disclosing Twitter stake\n\nMeanwhile, social network's board rejects resignation of one its directors\n\n[Katyanna Quach Fri 27 May 2022 // 21:26 UTC](https://www.theregister.com/Author/Katyanna-Quach)\nAmerica's financial watchdog is investigating whether Elon Musk adequately disclosed\nhis purchase of Twitter shares last month, just as his bid to take over the social media\ncompany hangs in the balance.\n\n[A letter [PDF] from the SEC addressed to the tech billionaire said he \"[did] not appear\"](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1418091/000000000022003713/filename1.pdf)\n[to have filed the proper form detailing his 9.2 percent stake in Twitter \"required 10 days](https://www.theregister.com/2022/04/04/elon_musk_twitter/)\nfrom the date of acquisition,\" and asked him to provide more information.
