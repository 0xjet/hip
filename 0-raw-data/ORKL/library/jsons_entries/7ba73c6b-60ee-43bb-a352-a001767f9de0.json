Now, one crime group has\nstarted using hacked Facebook accounts to run ads publicly pressuring their ransomware\nvictims into paying up.\n\nOn the evening of Monday, Nov. 9, an ad campaign apparently taken out by the Ragnar\nLocker Team began appearing on Facebook. The ad was designed to turn the screws to the\nItalian beverage vendor Campari Group, which [acknowledged on Nov. 3 that its computer](https://ftaonline.com/news/campari-group-vittima-di-un-attacco-malware)\n[systems had been sidelined by a malware attack.](https://www.zdnet.com/article/italian-beverage-vendor-campari-knocked-offline-after-ransomware-attack/)\n\nOn Nov. 6, Campari issued a follow-up statement saying “at this stage, we cannot completely\nexclude that some personal and business data has been taken.”\n\n“This is ridiculous and looks like a big fat lie,” reads the Facebook ad campaign from the\nRagnar crime group. “We can confirm that confidential data was stolen and we talking about\nhuge volume of data.”\n\n\n-----\n\nThe ad went on to say Ragnar Locker Team had offloaded two terabytes of information and\nwould give the Italian firm until 6 p.m. EST today (Nov. 10) to negotiate an extortion payment\nin exchange for a promise not to publish the stolen files.\n\nThe Facebook ad blitz was paid for by Hodson Event Entertainment, an account tied to\n[Chris Hodson, a deejay based in Chicago. Contacted by KrebsOnSecurity, Hodson said his](http://www.djchrishodson.com/)\nFacebook account indeed was hacked, and that the attackers had budgeted $500 for the\nentire campaign.\n\n“I thought I had two-step verification turned on for all my accounts, but now it looks like the\nonly one I didn’t have it set for was Facebook,” Hodson said.\n\nHodson said a review of his account shows the unauthorized campaign reached\napproximately 7,150 Facebook users, and generated 770 clicks, with a cost-per-result of 21\ncents. Of course, it didn’t cost the ransomware group anything. Hodson said Facebook billed\nhim $35 for the first part of the campaign, but apparently detected the ads as fraudulent\nsometime this morning before his account could be billed another $159 for the campaign.\n\nThe results of the unauthorized Facebook ad campaign.

A spokesperson for Facebook said the company is\nstill investigating the incident. A request for comment sent via email to Campari’s media\nrelations team was returned as undeliverable.\n\nBut it seems likely we will continue to see more of this and other mainstream advertising\nefforts by ransomware groups going forward, even if victims really have no expectation that\n[paying an extortion demand will result in criminals actually deleting or not otherwise using](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/11/why-paying-to-delete-stolen-data-is-bonkers/)\nstolen data.\n\n**[Fabian Wosar, chief technology officer at computer security firm Emsisoft, said some](https://www.emsisoft.com/)**\nransomware groups have become especially aggressive of late in pressuring their victims to\npay up.\n\n“They have also started to call victims,” Wosar said. “They’re outsourcing to Indian call\ncenters, who call victims asking when they are going to pay or have their data leaked.”\n\n\n-----",
