The adversary later](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/how-crowdstrike-stops-revil-ransomware-from-kaseya-attack/)_\n[opened up Darkside to affiliates through a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) program,](https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/ransomware/ransomware-as-a-service-raas/)\nallowing other actors to use the ransomware while paying CARBON SPIDER a portion of the\nreceived ransom.\n\nThe [first part of this two-part blog series explored CARBON SPIDER’s initial BGH campaigns](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/carbon-spider-embraces-big-game-hunting-part-1/)\nin depth. This blog discusses the Darkside ransomware incident at U.S. oil pipeline system\nColonial Pipeline in May 2021 and how CARBON SPIDER responded to fallout from this\nevent. Despite the termination of the Darkside program, the adversary continued malware\ndistribution campaigns and subsequently introduced the BlackMatter RaaS. Due to numerous\ntechnical overlaps with Darkside, BlackMatter is attributed to CARBON SPIDER.\n\n## Colonial Pipeline Incident\n\n\n-----\n\nOn May 8, 2021, Colonial Pipeline disclosed that it had been the victim of a ransomware\nincident the day before; however, it would be several days until the FBI indicated that1\nColonial Pipeline fell victim to Darkside ransomware. On May 9, 2021, a ransom payment of2\napproximately $4.4 million USD (75 BTC) was made to a probable Darkside affiliate. The\nU.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) later announced the seizure of the affiliate’s portion of this\npayment.3\n\nOn May 10, 2021, CARBON SPIDER posted a response to media attention to the Colonial\nPipeline incident on the Darkside dedicated leak site (DLS) stating they are “apolitical,” do\nnot participate in “geopolitics,” and that their “goal is to make money, and not creating\nproblems for society.” The post further mentioned a vetting process for all victims, providing\nfurther evidence that the Colonial Pipeline incident was conducted by an affiliate rather than\nthe core CARBON SPIDER group. These statements were likely made in an attempt to\ncorrect certain public speculation that the attack was politically motivated.\n\nA statement on May 13, 2021 — purportedly from CARBON SPIDER — claimed the\nadversary group lost access to the Darkside DLS, payment servers and content delivery\nnetwork (CDN) servers. The statement also claimed CARBON SPIDER servers had been\nblocked “at the request of law enforcement agencies.” Since then, CrowdStrike Intelligence\nhas not observed any new valid Darkside samples, indicating this date marked the end of the\n_Darkside RaaS. Separately on May 13, 2021, several forum administrators banned posts_\nrelating to [ransomware, likely to avoid media attention.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/ransomware/)\n\n## Subsequent CARBON SPIDER Operations\n\nDespite Darkside’s termination, CARBON SPIDER did not cease their operations or entirely\nabandon prior tooling. On May 25, 2021, CrowdStrike Falcon Complete and Falcon\n[OverWatch detected a SQL injection incident that delivered a PowerShell (PS) stager tracked](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/how-crowdstrike-stopped-an-sql-injection-campaign/)\nby CrowdStrike Intelligence as Demux.\n\nFrom May 31 through June 29, 2021, CARBON SPIDER used malicious Microsoft Excel and\nWord documents as well as Leo VBS to distribute an updated version of JSS Loader. This\nversion of JSS Loader — written in C++, compared to its .NET progenitor — introduced a\nnew packer.\n\nOn July 9 and 12, 2021, CARBON SPIDER used malicious Microsoft Word documents to\ndistribute the Harpy backdoor. These documents used Windows 11 Alpha-themed content\nidentical to lure content used in a JSS Loader campaign (Figure 1).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. JSS Loader/Harpy document content\n\nIn this campaign, after Harpy successfully contacted its command-and-control (C2) server, a\nJavaScript system enumeration module was delivered and executed by Harpy. This\nenumeration module strongly resembles a PS system enumeration module written for the\n_Domenus suite, providing evidence that both tools share a common developer._\n\nIn June 2021, a probable CARBON SPIDER actor deployed the open-source Hidden Tear\nransomware during a ransomware operation. This incident was attributed to CARBON\nSPIDER based on prior use of the Demux stager and the Sekur Remote Access Tool (RAT)\nto establish persistent access, in addition to Cobalt Strike. This incident marks the first known\nCARBON SPIDER ransomware campaign following the Colonial Pipeline incident; CARBON\nSPIDER likely chose to use Hidden Tear to avoid attracting additional attention.\n\n## BlackMatter\n\nOn 21 July 2021, a Russian-language forum member named BlackMatter sought to purchase\naccess to a variety of corporate networks. The actor specifically expressed interest in the\nU.S., Canada, Australia and the UK, and expressed disinterest in targeting medical or\ngovernment institutions. Subsequent CrowdStrike Intelligence analysis confirmed that\n_BlackMatter is provided to affiliates via a RaaS program, similar to Darkside._\n\nWindows PE and Linux ELF versions of BlackMatter were subsequently obtained and\nanalyzed. Extensive coding similarities indicate BlackMatter is highly likely the successor to\n_Darkside. Windows version overlaps include:_\n\nBuilding an import address table at runtime using dynamic function resolution\nUsing aPLib to decompress the embedded ransomware configuration\nOverlaps in configuration formats and multiple configuration items\n\n\n-----\n\nUsing the same file encryption system, including using Salsa20 to encrypt files through\na randomly generated state matrix and protecting the state matrix with an embedded\nRSA-1024 key\nUsing two HTTP C2 requests before and after file encryption containing system\ninformation and encryption statistics\nUsing Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) for shadow copy deletion\n\nLinux version overlaps include:\n\nA Red Hat Linux build environment\nBeing written in C++ and compiled using GCC with statically linked libcurl, Boost and\nCryptoPP libraries\nUsing the CryptoPP `RandomPool random number generator to produce symmetric`\nkeys\nUsing an embedded RSA-4096 public key to protect generated symmetric keys\nUsing an embedded configuration that specifies an RSA-4096 public key, an allowlist of\nfile extensions to encrypt, a thread count to use during encryption, a debug log file path\nand C2 domains\nAll BlackMatter extension allowlist values exist within Darkside’s configuration\nPerforming a C2 request via cURL containing embedded system information\nPlacing a hard-coded URL containing a unique URL string within the ransom note to\nthe victim payment portal\nThe ability to stop ESXi virtual machines using `esxcli`\nThe ability to enumerate ESXi volumes for encryption using `esxcli`\n\n_BlackMatter ransom notes direct victims to communicate via a portal hosted on Tor. If victims_\ndo not pay ransom demands, stolen files are typically posted on a DLS that is also hosted on\nTor. CrowdStrike Intelligence has identified BlackMatter victims spanning numerous sectors\nacross North and South America, Asia and Europe.\n\n## Conclusion and Outlook\n\nCrowdStrike Intelligence assesses CARBON SPIDER is highly likely behind the development\nof BlackMatter and operating the BlackMatter RaaS. This assessment carries high\nconfidence based on the extensive amount of technical overlaps between Darkside and\n_BlackMatter. CARBON SPIDER’s resilience and launch of BlackMatter shortly following the_\ntermination of Darkside demonstrates how difficult it is to disrupt cybercrime adversaries and\ntheir operations. The potential profits from ransomware are evidently worth risking potential\nlaw enforcement actions. Without fundamental changes in the economics of cybercrime,\nCARBON SPIDER and other actors will likely continue to provide RaaS programs to affiliates.\n\n### Indicators of Compromise\n\n\n-----\n\n**Type** **SHA256 Hash**\n\n\n_JSS Loader_\nC++\nversion\n\n_BlackMatter_\nWindows\n\n_BlackMatter_\nLinux\n\n```\n1414704797a7ecbbd0fb0ae48207bdef367697eafddd70fd646e4662a77a30d6\n\n```\n```\n22d7d67c3af10b1a37f277ebabe2d1eb4fd25afbd6437d4377400e148bcc08d6\n\n```\n```\n6a7b7147fea63d77368c73cef205eb75d16ef209a246b05698358a28fd16e502\n\n```\n\nTable 1.

High confidence in the quality and quantity of source information supporting a\njudgment does not imply that that assessment is an absolute certainty or fact. The\njudgment still has a marginal probability of being inaccurate.\n**Moderate Confidence: Judgments are based on information that is credibly sourced**\nand plausible, but not of sufficient quantity or corroborated sufficiently to warrant a\nhigher level of confidence. This level of confidence is used to express that judgments\ncarry an increased probability of being incorrect until more information is available or\ncorroborated.\n**Low Confidence: Judgments are made where the credibility of the source is uncertain,**\nthe information is too fragmented or poorly corroborated enough to make solid analytic\ninferences, or the reliability of the source is untested. Further information is needed for\ncorroboration of the information or to fill known intelligence gaps.\n\n### Endnotes\n\n1. https[:]//www.colpipe[.]com/news/press-releases/media-statement-colonial-pipeline\nsystem-disruption\n2. https[:]//www.fbi[.]gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/fbi-statement-on-compromise-of\ncolonial-pipeline-networks\n3. https[:]//www.justice[.]gov/opa/pr/department-justice-seizes-23-million-cryptocurrency\npaid-ransomware-extortionists-darkside\n\n**Additional Resources**\n\n_[For more intel about CARBON SPIDER, visit the CrowdStrike Adversary Universe.](https://adversary.crowdstrike.com/en-US/adversary/carbon-spider/)_\n_To find out how to incorporate intelligence on threat actors into your security strategy,_\n_visit the_ _[Falcon X™ Threat Intelligence page.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/endpoint-security-products/falcon-x-threat-intelligence/)_\n_Learn about the powerful, cloud-native CrowdStrike Falcon® platform by visiting the_\n_product webpage._\n\n\n-----\n\n_[Get a full-featured free trial of CrowdStrike Falcon Prevent™ to see for yourself how](https://go.crowdstrike.com/try-falcon-prevent.html)_\n_true next-gen AV performs against today’s most sophisticated threats._\n\n\n-----",
