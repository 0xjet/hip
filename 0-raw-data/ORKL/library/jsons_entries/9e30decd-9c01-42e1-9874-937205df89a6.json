For many parents\nand their children, it’s also time to go back to school—whether they’re ready for summer to\nbe over or not.\n\nUnfortunately, some scammers exploit the back-to-school season for their own nefarious\npurposes. Like most financially-motivated cybercrime, business email compromise (BEC)\nattacks are generally industry agnostic, meaning attackers don’t specifically target certain\nindustries or companies. Rather, financially-motivated cybercriminals try to maximize their\nreturn on investment by casting a wide net of potential victims.\n\nHowever, our Abnormal team has identified a specific group bucking this trend, which we call\nChiffon Herring. The group has been active since at least March 2022 and mainly targets\nlocal school districts and universities in the United States.\n\n\n-----\n\nTheir targets have ranged from large public universities to small community colleges, and\nfrom sprawling urban school districts to an individual all-girls preparatory school. Based on\nour research, Chiffon Herring actors are likely located in Nigeria and South Africa, both of\nwhich are typical hotbeds for BEC scammers.\n\n## A Background on Payroll Diversion\n\n[Payroll diversion is a popular form of business email compromise where an attacker targets](https://intelligence.abnormalsecurity.com/unique-attacks/executive-impersonated-in-payroll-diversion-scheme)\na human resources administrator and impersonates an employee (usually an executive) to\nrequest a change to the employee’s direct deposit account information.\n\nIn its early days, payroll diversion attacks almost exclusively targeted organizations in the\nUnited States. But in recent years, these attacks have shifted and are now targeting\nemployees across the world—specifically in Western Europe and Australia.\n\nThe payroll diversion landscape is primarily driven by the use of mule accounts, or accounts\nthat receive fraudulent funds, at non-traditional financial technology institutions. Accounts\nlinked to prepaid cards or third-party apps like Green Dot or CashApp make up an\noverwhelming percentage of the mule accounts associated with payroll diversion attacks.\n\n## Setting the Hook: A Look at Chiffon Herring’s Emails\n\nChiffon Herring is notably unique in that the group almost exclusively targets local school\ndistricts and universities.\n\nThe general structure of an attack from this group is similar to many other payroll diversion\nattacks. However, instead of impersonating company executives, Chiffon Herring generally\nposes as non-executive employees like teachers and professors and sends the attacks to\nthe department head at a university or office staff at a school district. Because their names\nand email addresses are publicly listed on most school websites, these individuals can be\nincredibly easy to impersonate and target.\n\nAn initial email from Chiffon Herring indicates the impersonated teacher has recently\nchanged banks and needs to update their direct deposit information. The email also\nmentions that the previous account will be inactive a few days before the next payday,\ninjecting some urgency into the request.\n\n_Example of an initial Chiffon Herring email_\n\n[A notable tactic used by Chiffon Herring is spoofing the email address of the teachers they](https://abnormalsecurity.com/glossary/email-spoofing)\nimpersonate, which makes the email seem as if it’s coming from a teacher’s legitimate email\naccount. Behind the scenes, however, the reply-to address is a Gmail or mail.com account\ncontrolled by the attacker, which is where any subsequent communications would be sent.\n\n\n-----\n\nSchools can often be an easier target for attackers because they are unlikely to have\nstringent cybersecurity protocols—unlike large enterprises or government entities. In the\ncase of the institutions targeted here, there is either no published DMARC record in place or\nit is not configured to reject unauthorized senders. This allows the attackers to use the exact\ndomain and thus bypass legacy systems that check only for this header information to detect\nattacks.\n\nIn addition to spoofing impersonated teacher email addresses, an analysis of email headers\nreveals Chiffon Herring also leverages GoDaddy infrastructure to send the attacks. The\n“Workspace Webmail 6.12.10” user agent string referenced in the headers indicates the\nemails are coming from GoDaddy’s webmail service, and the domains referenced in the\nheader “return-path” field signals a potentially compromised domain. The abuse of GoDaddy\ndomains to send malicious email campaigns is a longstanding problem that has been around\nfor years.\n\n_Header analysis of a Chiffon Herring email_\n\n## Reeling It In: Where the Stolen Teacher Paychecks Go\n\nIf a targeted employee responds to the initial email from Chiffon Herring, the attack moves\ninto the second stage. In this stage, the attacker provides details for a mule account to which\nthey want the impersonated teacher’s paycheck diverted.\n\nOur team conducts [active defense engagements with BEC actors to better understand the](https://cybernews.com/editorial/ex-fbi-analyst-goes-undercover-to-catch-crooks/)\nfull cycle of BEC attacks, including identifying mule accounts scammers use to receive\nfraudulent funds. In this case, we were able to identify one of the accounts associated with\nthis group.\n\n_Chiffon Herring email containing mule account information_\n\nChiffon Herring almost exclusively provides Green Dot accounts as an initial “replacement”\ndirect deposit account, which are generally linked to prepaid cards. Prepaid cards are\ncommonly used in payroll diversion attacks because many card issuers offer the option to\nreceive direct deposits up to 48 hours before a payday. This means that the threat actors\nhave access to the diverted funds for multiple days before the teacher even realizes anything\nis wrong.\n\nThe accounts are also relatively easy to open. A prepaid card can be obtained at a big box\nstore like Walmart, and then once the card is “registered,” a checking account is created that\ncan be used to receive funds. An account can also be opened online using a fake identity\nand the new account details are emailed to a scammer.\n\n## Securing Schools Against Cybercrime\n\n\n-----\n\nThreat actors continue to execute these attacks because they work. They have spent years\nperfecting the writing of these emails to make them look as legitimate as possible. And\nbecause they are not often the target of coordinated cyberattacks, many schools may not be\naware that they are being targeted by these scams.\n\nTo ensure protection against payroll diversion attacks, it is critical that all staff (and\nparticularly those in finance and human resources) are trained to detect the signs of phishing\nattacks. They should be reminded to read through emails carefully, and pay close attention to\nthe email addresses to make sure they are actually coming from the sender—especially\nwhen discussing something related to finances.\n\nIt’s also important to implement an email security solution that can detect signs of attacks\nand block malicious emails before they reach their intended recipient. Innovative solutions\nuse behavioral AI to analyze identity and content and then separate legitimate messages\nfrom dangerous threats. By baselining known-good behavior and detecting anomalies,\nmodern email security solutions can block the socially-engineered attacks that bypass legacy\nsystems.\n\n**_See how Abnormal protects educational organizations from the full spectrum of_**\n**_attacks._** **_[Request a demo today.](https://abnormalsecurity.com/demo?PS=organic%20website)_**\n\n## Appendix: Observed Email Addresses Linked to Chiffon Herring BEC Attacks\n\nadleymarcc565[@]gmail[.]com\n\nbankroll630[@]gmail[.]com\n\nbarbara.hiring[@]gmail[.]com\n\nbriannanicholas81[@]gmail[.]com\n\ncaseybrown847[@]gmail[.]com\n\ndeloreschapman6[@]gmail[.]com\n\ndirecttdepositoffice00[@]email[.]com\n\ngatekelvin2229[@]gmail[.]com\n\n\n-----\n\nginalocker9[@]gmail[.]com\n\ngodchoice088[@]gmail[.]com\n\ngtaylor9833[@]gmail[.]com\n\nhellen.brown18[@]yahoo[.]com\n\njilllain777[@]gmail[.]com\n\njohnrazoo820[@]gmail[.]com\n\nkathygros1313[@]gmail[.]com\n\nlarryeppler8[@]gmail[.]com\n\nlaurastiles1010[@]gmail[.]com\n\nlaureljames750[@]gmail[.]com\n\nluigi.cuneo45[@]gmail[.]com\n\nmariastewart314[@]gmail[.]com\n\nmathgradee[@]gmail[.]com\n\nmeetfish59[@]gmail[.]com\n\nmichealfought21[@]gmail[.]com\n\nmsadwick1[@]gmail[.]com\n\nmydirecttdeposittofffice[@]mail[.]com\n\nofficeink[@]mail[.]com\n\n\n-----\n\npayrollnetwork20[@]gmail[.]com\n\nrandal200lo[@]gmail[.]com\n\nreplydirectmail[@]gmail[.]com\n\nroselynnbrandon[@]gmail[.]com\n\nsadwicksandra[@]gmail[.]com\n\nshelbybilby2[@]gmail[.]com\n\nsmithanderson027[@]gmail[.]com\n\nsodibambam[@]yahoo[.]com\n\nsteverosewoodautomotive[@]gmail[.]com\n\nsureska57[@]mail[.]com\n\ntj602432[@]gmail[.]com\n\ntraymond231[@]gmail[.]com\n\nwdoris938[@]gmail[.]com\n\nwhelane28[@]gmail[.]com\n\nwilliamssamuel1232[@]gmail[.]com\n\nwilliamssarah3213[@]gmail[.]com\n\n\n-----",
