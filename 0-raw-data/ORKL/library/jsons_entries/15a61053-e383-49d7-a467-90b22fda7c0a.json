    "plain_text": "# UKRAINE: Timeline of Cyberattacks\n\n**cyberpeaceinstitute.org/ukraine-timeline-of-cyberattacks**\n\nFebruary 24, 2022\n\nAgainst the backdrop of the military invasion of Ukraine, the CyberPeace Institute is tracking\nhow cyberattacks and operations are, and have been, targeting critical infrastructure and\ncivilian objects.\n\nIn recent weeks there has been a significant escalation in the number of reported\ncyberattacks against Ukrainian institutions, organizations, including humanitarian NGOs, and\nthe wider population. Ukraine is no stranger to being on the receiving-end of cyberattacks\nand the timeline below tracks the most significant incidents to date.\n\n[The importance of tracking cyberattacks in Ukraine](https://cyberpeaceinstitute.org/ukraine-timeline-of-cyberattacks)\nThe tracking of cyberattacks and incidents as they become public is important in order to\nrecord these attacks and identify – where possible – the harm and risks for civilian\npopulations. Cyberattacks affect people and risk lives. In the future, it will be important to use\nthe information on cyberattacks to identify developments or clarifications of the law in relation\nto the use of cyber operations in armed conflicts, and for accountability including in any\nfuture judicial proceedings.\n\n[Harm caused by cyberattacks during an armed conflict](https://cyberpeaceinstitute.org/ukraine-timeline-of-cyberattacks)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe targeting of critical infrastructure raises particular concern as this infrastructure is\nessential for the survival of the civilian population. Attacks on infrastructure such as energy,\nwater, healthcare, financial institutions, transport and communication services can have\ndevastating consequences on the civilian population. NGOs responding to the humanitarian\nneeds of the population in Ukraine and neighboring countries are targeted by cyberattacks in\norder to disrupt their activities.\n\nBeyond the risks to critical infrastructure and civilian objects, cyberattacks sow distrust and\nlimit access to accurate information or spread false information. They can also be highly\ndisruptive and create a sense of fear and uncertainty and even lead to the eventual\ndisplacement of people.\n\n[Civilian populations are protected under international humanitarian law](https://cyberpeaceinstitute.org/ukraine-timeline-of-cyberattacks)\nThe important legal principles of distinction (distinguish at all times between military\nobjectives and civilian objects) and proportionality (prohibit attacks expected to cause\nexcessive civilian harm) have a direct bearing on cyber operations during armed conflicts in\norder to protect the civilian population against the effects of such operations.\n\n[Frequently Asked Questions on the laws of armed conflict with a focus on cyber.](https://cyberpeaceinstitute.org/news/ukraine-conflict-faq-about-cyberattacks/)\n\n[Ukraine conflict and the work of the CyberPeace Institute](https://cyberpeaceinstitute.org/ukraine-timeline-of-cyberattacks)\nThe CyberPeace Institute’s mission is to reduce the scale and frequency of cyberattacks\n[against vulnerable communities, provide assistance and advocate for](https://cyberpeaceinstitute.org/assisting-humanitarian-ngos/) respect of laws and\nnorms. Thus, documenting cyberattacks is important to understand the harm caused to\npeople. The [CyberPeace Builders program is a trustworthy volunteer network designed to](https://cyberpeaceinstitute.org/cyberpeacebuilders/)\nhelp humanitarian NGOs strengthen their cybersecurity.\n\n[Factsheet on Ukraine conflict and the work of the CyberPeace Institute.](https://cyberpeaceinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/Fact-Sheet_Ukraine.pdf)\n\n[Call for Support from the CyberPeace Institute](https://cyberpeaceinstitute.org/ukraine-timeline-of-cyberattacks)\nCrucial to the work of the Institute are open source research by our small team of experts.\nCan you support the Institute’s data collection?\n\nIf you have the capabilities to support our ongoing work to collect data on cyberattacks\nrelated to the armed conflict in Ukraine and/or cases of cyberattacks against the\nhealthcare sector and humanitarian NGOs, we would appreciate hearing from you.\nWe seek online volunteers who can dedicate a few hours of their time and expertise to\nsupport the work of the Institute.\n[Find out more by contacting [email protected].](https://cyberpeaceinstitute.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#debdb7aa9ebda7bcbbacaebbbfbdbbb7b0adaab7aaabaabbf0b1acb9)\n\n\n-----",
