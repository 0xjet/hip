    "plain_text": "# Threat profile: Egregor ransomware is making a name for itself\n\n**[blog.malwarebytes.com/ransomware/2020/12/threat-profile-egregor-ransomware-is-making-a-name-for-itself/](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/ransomware/2020/12/threat-profile-egregor-ransomware-is-making-a-name-for-itself/)**\n\nPieter Arntz December 15, 2020\n\n## What is Egregor?\n\nEgregor ransomware is a relatively new ransomware (first spotted in September 2020) that\nseems intent on making its way to the top right now. Egregor is considered a variant of\n[Ransom.Sekhmet based on similarities in obfuscation, API-calls, and the ransom note.](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/detections/ransom-sekhmet/)\n\nAs we’ve reported in the past, affiliates that were using Maze ransomware started moving\n[over to Egregor even before the Maze gang officially announced they were calling it quits.](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/ransomware/2020/11/maze-ransomware-gang-announces-retirement/)\nEgregor has already targeted some well-known victims like Barnes & Noble, Kmart and\nUbisoft.\n\n## How does Egregor spread?\n\nThe primary distribution method for Egregor is Cobalt Strike. Targeted environments are\n[initially compromised through various means (RDP probing,](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/exploits-and-vulnerabilities/2020/10/brute-force-attacks-increasing/) [phishing) and once the](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/glossary/phishing/) Cobalt\nStrike beacon payload is established and persistent, it is then used to deliver and launch the\nEgregor payloads.\n\n_First part of_\n\n_the Egregor ransom note_\nBut since Egregor is a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operation with multiple affiliates, the\ndelivery and weaponization tactics can vary. We’ve also seen it being spread via phishing\nemails recently. The attack typically unfolds in two steps: initial compromise with email lure\nthat drops [Qakbot, followed by the actual Egregor ransomware. The latter is deployed](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/detections/worm-qakbot/)\nmanually by the attackers who have previously gained access as a result of the initial\ncompromise.\n\n\n-----\n\n[There have also been some reports of Egregor utilizing CVE-2020-0688 (a remote code](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-0688)\nexecution flaw in Microsoft Exchange). Some sources also report the possible exploitation of\n[CVE-2018-8174 (VBScript Engine), CVE-2018-4878 (Adobe Flash Player), and CVE-2018-](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-8174)\n15982 (Adobe Flash Player).\n\nThe most common attack method seems to entail an initial spray-and-pray tactic, after which\nthe threat actors make a selection of the available openings. They will obviously go for the\neasiest and most profitable ones based on primary reconnaissance data from the first stage\nof the attack. They will then try to enlarge their foothold on the breached network and look for\nthe data and servers that are most critical for the victim. This will give the attackers extra\nleverage and a bigger chance to cash in their ransom demand.\n\nEgregor does not seem to have a geographical preference, even though Sekhmet has\nseemed to focus on the US in the past 7 weeks.\n\n_Sekhmet attacks in the last 7 weeks_\n\n_per country_\n\n## Egregor threatens to leak exfiltrated data\n\nAccording to the ransom note, if the ransom is not paid by the company within 3 days, and\naside from leaking part of the stolen data, the attackers will announce the breach through\nmass media so the company’s partners and clients will know that the company was\nvictimized\n\n\n-----\n\n_Part 2_\n\n_of the Egregor ransom note_\nIn all three the cases we mentioned earlier, the attackers published information on a leak site\nshowing that they had accessed files during the attack, but didn’t necessarily reveal source\ncode or anything particularly sensitive.\n\n_Announcements of leaked data on the Egregor website_\n\n\n-----\n\n## Education by the hands-on experts\n\nA very typical trait of the Egregor ransomware is that the attackers offer to educate their\nvictims in order to help them escape future attacks.\n\n_Part 3_\n\n_of the Egregor ransom note_\nCybersecurity advice is promised to those victims that pay the ransom as an extra bonus.\nWhat these recommendations look like is unknown at the time of writing. A truthful\nexplanation about how the victim in question was infected, infiltrated, and how data was\nexfiltrated would certainly help in a forensic investigation of the incident.\n\n## Egregor victim Randstad\n\nOne of the latest victims seems to be Netherlands-based Randstad, one of the largest\n[recruitment- and head-hunting agencies in the world. In its press release, Randstad](https://tools.eurolandir.com/tools/Pressreleases/GetPressRelease/?ID=3845464&lang=en-GB&companycode=nl-rand&v=ticker)\nspecifically calls out Egregor as the attacker.\n\n“We believe the incident started with a phishing email that initiated malicious software to be\ninstalled,” a Randstad spokesperson said in an email.\n\n_The_\n\n_listing on the Egregor site confirms the attack_\nThe press release confirms the stolen data but is unclear about the exact content.\n\n\n-----\n\nTo date, our investigation has revealed that the Egregor group obtained unauthorized\nand unlawful access to our global IT environment and to certain data, in particular\nrelated to our operations in the US, Poland, Italy and France. They have now published\nwhat is claimed to be a subset of that data.”\n\nDepending on the stolen data, and given the line of business, the content could be very\nsensitive and confidential. According to Randstad, the company was able to limit the impact,\nand the stolen data are in particular related to their operations in the US, Poland, Italy and\nFrance.\n\nThird party cybersecurity and forensic experts were engaged to assist with the investigation\nand remediation of the incident.\n\n## IOCs\n\n**Tor Onion URLs:**\n\negregorwiki.top\nwikiegregor.top\nsekhmet.top\nsekhmetleaks.top\n\n**SHA256 hashes:**\n\n4c9e3ffda0e663217638e6192a093bbc23cd9ebfbdf6d2fc683f331beaee0321\naee131ba1bfc4b6fa1961a7336e43d667086ebd2c7ff81029e14b2bf47d9f3a7\n\n**Ransom note:**\n\nRECOVER-FILES.txt (some parts of the ransom note can be seen in the article)\n\n\n-----",
