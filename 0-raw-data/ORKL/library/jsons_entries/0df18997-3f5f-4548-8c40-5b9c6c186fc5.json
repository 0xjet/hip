The malware’s vendor, who went\nby the online moniker Gosya, was a Russian-speaking member who introduced himself as\n[the developer of Nuclear Bot, or NukeBot, a modular banking Trojan.](https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/collection/Nuclear-Bot-NukeBot-aka-Micro-Banking-Trojan-8b18e7c897b6be1575ddebec42f1d456)\n\nConsidering the demand for commercially available malware in the cybercrime community,\nthis malware should have been accepted very eagerly. But instead, its developer’s user\naccount was banned from multiple forums. In March 2017, the source code was leaked,\napparently by the developer himself.\n\nWhat led to this leak, and what impact can we expect as a result?\n\n## Gosya Comes to Town\n\nIn cybercrime forums, and especially in the more closed and Russian-speaking communities,\nmembers earn credibility by following certain customary steps. To begin, they must be\nintroduced by a known member and vetted by the community according to what they can\noffer. Most importantly, they must gain the trust of the administrators running the board.\n\n[When Gosya joined underground communities, he apparently did not follow all the customary](https://securityintelligence.com/the-dark-web-marketplace-a-shopping-center-for-attackers/)\nsteps. He was introduced by a known member but took some wrong turns from there.\n\n\n-----\n\nImmediately upon joining, Gosya began advertising a new banking malware for sale.\nAccording to X-Force research observations, he did not have the malware tested and\ncertified by forum admins, nor did he provide any test versions to members. At the same\ntime, he was attacked by existing competition, namely the FlokiBot vendor, who wanted to\nget down to the technical nitty gritty with him and find out if Gosya’s claims about his\nmalware’s capabilities were indeed viable.\n\nIn posts where he replied to challenging questions, Gosya got nervous and defensive, raising\nsuspicion among other forum members. This was likely a simple case of inexperience, but it\ncost him the trust of potential buyers.\n\nFor his next wrong move, Gosya started selling on additional forums under multiple\nmonikers. When fraudsters realized that the same person was trying to vend under different\nnames, they got even more suspicious that he was a ripper, misrepresenting or selling a\nproduct he does not possess. The issue got worse when Gosya changed the malware’s\nname to Micro Banking Trojan in one last attempt to buy it a new life.\n\nThat was the point when Gosya was banned in the forums where he was attempting to sell\nhis bot.\n\n[Read the white paper: Shifting the balance of power with cognitive fraud prevention](https://www-01.ibm.com/marketing/iwm/dre/signup?source=mrs-form-9451&S_PKG=ov54550%20)\n\n## Was NukeBot Ever Real?\n\n[The notable part of this case is that NukeBot is an actual banking malware. It is a functional,](https://securityintelligence.com/security-in-banking-are-you-facing-the-right-direction/)\nmodular Trojan that comes with a web-based admin panel to control infected endpoints. The\nmalware is capable of webinjections and does not fall short of other, similar code by much.\n\n_Figure 1_ _NukeBot’s Web-Based Admin Panel_\n\nWhen NukeBot had a test server up, it was captured and analyzed by Arbor Networks, which\n[blogged about it in December 2016. Based on this analysis, the malware was a functional](https://www.arbornetworks.com/blog/asert/dismantling-nuclear-bot/)\nand viable code from the get go.\n\nIBM X-Force researchers also analyzed NukeBot, specifically because Gosya claimed it was\n[able to circumvent IBM Security’s antifraud protection product, Trusteer Rapport. These](https://www.ibm.com/software/products/en/trusteer-rapport)\nclaims were dispelled by X-Force, which determined that NukeBot did not affect Rapport at\nany point in its development. X-Force researchers also concluded that NukeBot was not a\nfake product and that its developer was not being taken seriously due to the way he\nintroduced the malware, not because it was a hoax.\n\n## A Bruised Ego and a Malware Code Leak\n\n\n-----\n\nBanned from the underground venues where he planned to sell NukeBot and distrusted by\nmembers of the cybercrime community, NukeBot’s developer was likely struggling to come to\nterms with months of hard work amounting to nothing.\n\nIn mid-March 2017, X-Force researchers noticed that NukeBot’s code was leaked in a webbased source code management platform and made available for anyone to pick it up. This\nmove appears to have been the action of the developer, not an intentional leak by another\nparty.\n\nWhat could this mean? An educated guess would be that Gosya was disappointed with the\ndistrust he faced in the underground and decided to release the main module of the malware\nfor others to test and attest to.\n\nIn Gosya’s arguments with the FlokiBot developer, the latter boasted the number of Google\nresults that appear when one searches the FlockiBot value. Gosya may think the malware\nwill get picked up by more experienced operators and start appearing in attacks in the wild —\nand in additional security blogs.\n\nWith yet another [malware source code out in the open, the most likely scenario is that](https://securityintelligence.com/news/leaked-source-code-may-lead-to-more-banking-trojan-attacks-researchers-warn/)\nNukeBot code will be recompiled and used by botnet operators. Parts of it may be embedded\ninto other malware codes, and we are likely to see actual NukeBot fraud attacks in the wild in\nthe coming months.\n\nIt’s also possible that Gosya will be readmitted to the same forums from which he was\nbanned, this time as an authorized vendor. He may even deliver on previous promises to\nsupply new modules for the malware.\n\n## Code Leaks Mean More Malware\n\nWe know from previous incidents, such as the Zeus, Gozi and Carberp leaks, that publicly\navailable source code makes for more malware. This is often incorporated into existing\nprojects. X-Force researchers noted that NukeBot is likely to see the same process take\nplace in the wild, especially since its code is not copied from other leaked malware, per the\ndeveloper’s claims.\n\nAt this time, NukeBot has not been detected in real-world attacks and does not have defined\ntarget lists. This situation is likely to change in the near future.\n\nTo help stop threats such as NukeBot before they ever cause damage, banks and service\nproviders can use adaptive solutions to detect infections and protect customer endpoints.\nFighting evolving malware threats can be made easier with the right malware detection\nsolutions. With protection layers designed to address the ever-changing threat landscape,\nfinancial organizations can benefit from malware intelligence that provides real-time insight\ninto fraudster techniques and capabilities.\n\n\n-----\n\nConsumers wishing to protect themselves from malware infections on endpoints and mobile\n[devices are invited to read our best practices page.](https://securityintelligence.com/mitigating-malware-modern-mobile-world/)\n\n[Read the white paper: Shifting the balance of power with cognitive fraud prevention](https://www-01.ibm.com/marketing/iwm/dre/signup?source=mrs-form-9451&S_PKG=ov54550%20)\n\n[Limor Kessem](https://securityintelligence.com/author/limor-kessem/)\nExecutive Security Advisor, IBM\n\nLimor Kessem is an Executive Security Advisor at IBM Security.
