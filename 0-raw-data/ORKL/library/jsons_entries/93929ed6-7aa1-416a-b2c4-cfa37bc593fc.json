    "plain_text": "# Cooperative Efforts To Shut Down Virut Botnet\n\n**[spamhaus.org/news/article/690/cooperative-efforts-to-shut-down-virut-botnet](https://www.spamhaus.org/news/article/690/cooperative-efforts-to-shut-down-virut-botnet)**\n\nDuring the past few weeks, Spamhaus has worked hard to shut down a botnet called \"Virut\".\n\n**Virut take down**\n\nVirut is a worm that spreads through removable drives such as USB sticks and network\nshares, but it also has file infection capabilities it uses to spread itself. Virut was first detected\nin 2006 and became a serious threat with an estimated size of more than 300,000\ncompromised computers. Cybercriminals are using several dozen domain names, mainly\nwithin the .pl ccTLD (Poland), but also within the .ru ccTLD (Russia) and the .at ccTLD\n(Austria). These domains are registered by the operators of Virut to control the botnet. In the\npast few months, Virut has started to drop ZeuS (ebanking Trojan) and Kehlios (Spambot)\nonto computers infected with Virut as part of their Pay Per Install business model (PPI).\n\nDue to Virut's persistence, there have already been a couple of take down efforts in the past.\nHowever, none of those efforts have been successful thus far. The most recent take down\neffort was in December 2012, wherein Spamhaus managed to have suspended all the Virut\ndomain names registered through various Polish registrars within the .pl ccTLD.\nUnfortunately, the Virut botnet gang managed to get the malicious botnet domain names\n[moved to a new registrar called home.pl quickly.](https://home.pl/)\n\nIn past few days, Spamhaus has been in close contact with the sponsoring registrar\n[(home.pl), the Polish Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT.pl) to get the domain](https://www.cert.pl/)\nnames suspended. In cooperation with the Polish CERT and the registrar home.pl, we\nmanaged to get all the Virut domain names within the .pl ccTLD sinkholed.\n\n[In addition, Spamhaus reached out to the Austrian CERT and the Russian based Company](http://cert.at/)\n_Group-IB_ [CERT-GIB to shut down the remaining Virut domains within the .at and .ru ccTLDs.](http://www.cert-gib.ru/)\nIn cooperation with Spamhaus, and due to the evidence and intelligence provided by\nSpamhaus, CERT-GIB was able to shut down all the Virut domains within the .ru ccTLD\nwithin a few hours.\n\nThe last remaining stronghold for the Virut C&C domains is the .at ccTLD. Having alerted\nboth nic.at and the Austrian CERT multiple times about this issue we hope that they can\nsoon follow the examples set by the work done with .pl and .ru.\n\n**The important role of registries and registrars**\nThe Virut takedown effort clearly illustrates the important and meaningful role registries and\nregistrars can play in the fight against cybercrime in general. Domains often are a critical part\nof malicious infrastructure and by being proactive their efforts can contribute a lot to online\n\n\n-----\n\nsafety. We therefor urge registries and registrars to add clauses to the registration contracts\nthat allow them to take action in cases where the domains involved are clearly only used for\nbad purposes.\n\n**International cooperation to address cyber-threats**\nHow long the shut-down of Virut will last this time is unknown. However, we remain\ncommitted to continue the fight against cyber threats. The recent Virut take down is a good\nmodel for the future: the internet has no borders, and the community can only fight\ncybercrime successfully with international cooperation and coordination. Spamhaus will\ncontinue to work with its partners around the globe to follow its mission, protecting internet\nusers from cyber threats.\n\n**Further reading**\n[CERT.pl: NASK shuts down dangerous Virut botnet domains](https://www.cert.pl/news/6666/langswitch_lang/en)\n[Symantec: Snapshot of Virut Botnet After Interruption](http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/snapshot-virut-botnet-after-interruption)\n[Symantec: W32.Virut](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2007-041117-2623-99)\n[Microsoft: Win32/Virut](http://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/threat/encyclopedia/entry.aspx?name=win32%2fvirut)\n\n\n-----",
