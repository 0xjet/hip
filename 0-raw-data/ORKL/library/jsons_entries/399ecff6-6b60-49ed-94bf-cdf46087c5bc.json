    "plain_text": "# The Duties Beyond Assisting the Public: Darknet Threats Against Canadian Health & Support Organizations\n\n**ke-la.com/duties-beyond-assisting-the-public/**\n\nMay 10, 2020\n\nAs if a global pandemic crisis isn’t enough, organizations focused on the health and support\nof citizens have been forced to combat not only a widespread virus (and the public needs\nthat come with it), but also threats coming at them from the underground world. As the\npandemic continues to affect all types of both private- and government-affiliated\norganizations worldwide, KELA’s Cyber Intelligence Center took a look into various assets\npertaining to Canadian health and support organizations to assess how their attack surfaces\nmay be affected. This blog post will highlight just a couple of darknet findings that our team\nhas detected, which exemplify how threat actors are targeting these types of organizations in\nCanada.\n\n## Exploring New Victims\n\nAs COVID-19-related scams continue to rise, actors behind cheque fraud have now\nexpanded their portfolio, targeting a new group of victims — Canadian relief programs. Take\nthe Canadian Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) for example. Our analysts at KELA\n\n\n-----\n\ndiscovered various offerings for cheques claimed to resemble those of CERB, inviting\nfraudsters to profit by receiving potential funding. It works very simply. Threat actors make\nthese cheques ready to use by offering buyers either scans or prints of lookalike government\ncheques, which they then can deposit into their “drop” accounts, preferably via mobile\ndeposit.\n\nHere’s a peak into some of the CERB offerings that were available last week on a credible\nand well-known Canadian-focused underground market:\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n## Exploring New Markets\n\nFamiliar and “everyday” threats are targeting very sensitive organizations during this crisis,\nbut there are some rather “new” threat types booming as well. In addition to the botnet\nmarkets, hacking forums, instant messaging platforms, and other underground sites that\nKELA automatically monitors, KELA’s technologies now gather intelligence from automated\nshops that sell access to compromised servers.\n\nWe dived into a market of this type and detected webshell access to a subdomain of the one\nof the largest hospitals in Toronto (among other health-related organizations) for sale. The\nfortunate threat actor that purchases this can instantly be granted access to remotely control\nthe hospital’s server at any time, which in turn enables them to perform a variety of different\nactions depending on the breached server purchased. To state an example, let’s take\nsomething very common that’s been hitting many headlines recently – ransomware attacks.\nBeing granted access to controlling one’s servers from a distance can, among other things,\nlead to a ransomware attack, therefore placing organizations in a high-risk situation amid all\nother COVID-19 issues they are faced with. Organizations – especially those related to the\nhealthcare sector – cannot afford even the smallest potential cyber attack as they deal with\nlarger, more critical issues.\n\n\n-----\n\n_These are two examples of webshell access for sale pertaining to two different health-related_\n_organizations in Canada. These listing were posted in a remote access marketplace. KELA’s_\n_[DARKBEAST indexes data from this market, among others, and allows users to search through them in](https://ke-la.com/our-solutions/)_\n_real-time._\n\n## What Can We Do?\n\nLet’s state the truth: threat actors – for the most part – aren’t on pause with much of the rest\nof the world. So, the real question asked is How can security practitioners develop some\n_level of protection as COVID-19 continues? The key here is for organizations to establish_\nand maintain resiliency – in our case, with targeted threat intelligence monitoring. These\nprofessionals should be investing all efforts in monitoring their sensitive assets as seen by\nthe underground community, in an aim of deterring potential cyberattacks against them. With\nproactive monitoring, organizations related to the health and support of citizens can focus\ntheir efforts on dealing with citizen-focused issues during these unprecedented times.\n\nInterested in learning more about how you can receive real-time targeted intelligence straight\nfrom KELA’s data lake?
