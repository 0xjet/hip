In\n2020, the group used Manuscrypt in attacks on defense enterprises in different countries.\nThese attacks are described in the report “Lazarus targets defense industry with\nThreatNeedle“.\n\nCuriously, the data exfiltration channel of the malware uses an implementation of the KCP\nprotocol that has previously been seen in the wild only as part of the APT41 group’s toolset.\nWe dubbed the newly-identified malware PseudoManuscrypt.\n\n[The PseudoManuscrypt loader makes its way onto user systems via a MaaS platform that](https://encyclopedia.kaspersky.com/glossary/malware-as-a-service-maas/?utm_source=securelist&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=termin-explanation)\ndistributes malware in pirated software installer archives. One specific case of the\nPseudoManuscrypt downloader’s distribution is its installation via the Glupteba botnet\n(whose main installer is also distributed via the pirated software installer distribution\nplatform). This means that the malware distribution tactics used by the threat actor behind\nPseudoManuscrypt demonstrate no particular targeting.\n\n\n-----\n\nDuring the period from January 20 to November 10, 2021, Kaspersky products blocked\nPseudoManuscrypt on more than 35,000 computers in 195 countries of the world. Such a\nlarge number of attacked systems is not characteristic of the Lazarus group or APT attacks\nas a whole.\n\nTargets of PseudoManuscrypt attacks include a significant number of industrial and\ngovernment organizations, including enterprises in the military-industrial complex and\nresearch laboratories.\n\nAccording to our telemetry, at least 7.2% of all computers attacked by the PseudoManuscrypt\nmalware are part of industrial control systems (ICS) used by organizations in various\nindustries, including Engineering, Building Automation, Energy, Manufacturing, Construction,\nUtilities, and Water Management.\n\nThe main PseudoManuscrypt module has extensive and varied spying functionality. It\nincludes stealing VPN connection data, logging keypresses, capturing screenshots and\nvideos of the screen, recording sound with the microphone, stealing clipboard data and\noperating system event log data (which also makes stealing RDP authentication data\npossible), and much more. Essentially, the functionality of PseudoManuscrypt provides the\nattackers with virtually full control of the infected system.\n\n[More information on PseudoManuscrypt is available on the Kaspersky ICS CERT website.](https://ics-cert.kaspersky.com/reports/2021/12/16/pseudomanuscrypt-a-mass-scale-spyware-attack-campaign/)\n\n[Data theft](https://securelist.com/tag/data-theft/)\n[Industrial control systems](https://securelist.com/tag/industrial-control-systems/)\n[Lazarus](https://securelist.com/tag/lazarus/)\n[Malware Descriptions](https://securelist.com/tag/malware-descriptions/)\n[Malware Statistics](https://securelist.com/tag/malware-statistics/)\n[Malware Technologies](https://securelist.com/tag/malware-technologies/)\n[Phishing](https://securelist.com/tag/phishing/)\n[Spyware](https://securelist.com/tag/spyware/)\n\nAuthors\n\n[Kaspersky ICS CERT](https://securelist.com/author/icscert/)\n\nPseudoManuscrypt: a mass-scale spyware attack campaign\n\nYour email address will not be published.

In this report we describe how the MoonBounce\nimplant works and how it is connected to APT41.\n\n## The BlueNoroff cryptocurrency hunt is still on\n\nIt appears that BlueNoroff shifted focus from hitting banks and SWIFT-connected servers to\nsolely cryptocurrency businesses as the main source of the group’s illegal income.\n\nSubscribe to our weekly e-mails\n\nThe hottest research right in your inbox\n\n\n-----\n\n-----",
