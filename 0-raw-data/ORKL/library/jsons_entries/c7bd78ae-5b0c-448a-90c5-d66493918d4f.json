These malicious actors could use these forums to also spread disinformation\nsuggesting successful cyber operations have compromised election infrastructure and\nfacilitated the “hacking” and “leaking” of U.S. voter registration data.\n\nIn reality, much U.S. voter information can be purchased or acquired through publicly\navailable sources. While cyber actors have in recent years obtained voter registration\ninformation, the acquisition of this data did not impact the voting process or the integrity of\nelection results. In addition, the FBI and CISA have no information suggesting any\n\n\n-----\n\ncyberattack on U.S. election infrastructure has prevented an election from occurring,\ncompromised the accuracy of voter registration information, prevented a registered voter\nfrom casting a ballot, or compromised the integrity of any ballots cast.\n\nRecommendations\n\nSeek out information from trustworthy sources, verify who produced the content, and\nconsider their intent.\nRely on state and local election officials for information about voter registration\ndatabases and voting systems.\nView early, unverified claims with a healthy dose of skepticism.\nVerify through multiple reliable sources any reports about compromises of voter\ninformation or voting systems, and consider searching for other reliable sources before\nsharing such information via social media or other avenues.\nReport potential election crimes—such as disinformation about the manner, time, or\nplace of voting—to the FBI.\nIf appropriate, make use of in-platform tools offered by social media companies for\nreporting suspicious posts that appear to be spreading false or inconsistent information\nabout voter information or voting systems.\n\nThe FBI and CISA coordinate closely with federal, state, and local election partners and\nprovide services and information to safeguard U.S. voting processes and maintain the\nintegrity of U.S. elections. Both organizations urge the American public to critically evaluate\nthe sources of the information they consume and to seek out reliable and verified\ninformation.\n\nThe FBI is responsible for investigating malign foreign influence operations and malicious\ncyber activity targeting election infrastructure and other U.S. democratic institutions. CISA is\nresponsible for protecting the nation’s critical infrastructure from physical and cyber threats\nand has provided voluntary guidance, training, exercises, and other resources to help state\nand local election officials secure their voter registration systems and data.\n\nVictim Reporting and Additional Information\n\nThe FBI encourages the public to report information concerning suspicious or criminal\n[activity to their local field office (www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices) or to the FBI’s Internet](https://www.ic3.gov/Home/Egress?url=https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices)\n[Crime Complaint Center (www.ic3.gov).
