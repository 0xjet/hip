The\nKelihos.c version mostly infects computers through Facebook by sending users of the\n[website malicious download links. Once clicked, a Trojan horse named Fifesoc is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_horse_(computing))\n[downloaded, which turns the computer into a zombie, which is part of the botnet.[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombie_(computer_science))\n\nOn 24 November 2015 a Kelihos botnet event occurred causing widespread false positives\nof blacklisted IPs:\n\n\n-----\n\nNovember 24, 2015 Widespread false positives\n\nEarlier today, a very large scale Kelihos botnet event occurred - by large scale, many\nemail installations will be seeing in excess of 20% kelihos spam, and some will see\ntheir inbound email volume jump by a volume of as much as 500%. This isn't an\nunusual thing normally, the CBL/XBL has been successfully dealing with large scale\nKelihos spam spikes like this, often daily, for years.\n\nThe email was allegedly from the US Federal Reserve, saying something about\nrestrictions in \"U.S. Federal Wire and ACH online payments.\" Not only was the notice\nitself fraudulent, the attached Excel spreadsheet (.xls) contained macro instructions (a\ndownloader) to download a Windows executable virus, most likely Dyreza or Dridex\nmalware.\n\n\nThe detection rules initially deployed by the CBL unfortunately were insufficiently\ndetailed, and listed a number of IP addresses in error.″[19]\n\n[An affidavit unsealed on 5 February 2018, showed Apple's unexpected role in bringing the](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.)\n[Russian spam king to justice. Peter Levashov allegedly ran the Kelihos botnet under the](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Levashov)\nalias \"Severa\", renting out access to spammers and other cybercriminals. But despite\nLevashov's significant efforts at anonymity, court records show that federal agents had been\n[surveilling his iCloud account since 20 May 2016, funneling back crucial information that may](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICloud)\nhave led to his arrest. The standing federal iCloud warrant would have given authorities a\n[running tab of IP addresses used to log in to the account, which could easily have tipped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address)\nthem off to his vacation in [Barcelona, Spain, and was arrested at the request of US law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona)\nenforcement and extradited to the United States for prosecution.[20]\n\n## Structure, operations and spread\n\n\n[The Kelihos botnet is a so-called peer-to-peer botnet, where individual botnet nodes are](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer)\ncapable of acting as command-and-control servers for the entire botnet. In traditional nonpeer-to-peer botnets, all the nodes receive their instructions and \"work\" from a limited set of\nservers – if these servers are removed or taken down, the botnet will no longer receive\ninstructions and will therefore effectively shut down.[21] Peer-to-peer botnets seek to mitigate\nthat risk by allowing every peer to send instructions to the entire botnet, thus making it more\ndifficult to shut down.[2]\n\n[The first version of the botnet was mainly involved in denial-of-service attacks and](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDoS#Distributed_attack) email\n[spam, while version two of the botnet added the ability to steal Bitcoin wallets, as well as a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin)\n[program used to mine bitcoins itself.[2][22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#Mining) Its spam capacity allows the botnet to spread itself\n[by sending malware links to users in order to infect them with a Trojan horse, though later](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware)\nversions mostly propagate over social network sites, in particular through Facebook.[16][23] A\nmo[24] re comprehensive list of the Kelihos spam can be found in the following research paper.\n\n\n-----\n\nU.S. v. Levashov Search Warrant (Unsealed)\n\n## Arrest and extradition\n\nOn 2 February 2018, the [United States Department of Justice announced that a Russian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice)\n[national has been extradited from Spain and will be arraigned in Connecticut on charges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain)\nstemming from his alleged operation of the Kelihos botnet. Peter Yuryevich Levashov, 37,\nalso known as Pyotr Levashov,[25] Petr Levashov, Peter Severa, Petr Severa and Sergey\n[Astakhov, of St. Petersburg, was detained on 7 April 2017 in Barcelona, when he was](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona)\narrested by Spanish authorities based upon a criminal complaint and arrest warrant issued in\nthe United States District of Connecticut.[26] On 3 February 2018, he pleaded not guilty to the\n[charges of wire and email fraud,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mail_and_wire_fraud) [hacking,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Fraud_and_Abuse_Act#Criminal_offenses_under_the_Act) [identity theft and](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_theft_in_the_United_States) [conspiracy after appearing before](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_against_the_United_States)\n[a federal judge in the U.S. state of Connecticut.
