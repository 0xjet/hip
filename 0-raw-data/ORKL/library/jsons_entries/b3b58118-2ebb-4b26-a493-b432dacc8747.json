The Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA)\nis composed of five main service branches, the PLA Ground Force, PLA Navy, PLA Air\nForce, Second Artillery Corps, and the PLA Reserved Force. China has one of the world’s\nlargest military forces, with 2.3 million active members, a reserve force of 800,000, and a\nparamilitary force of 3.9 million, for a grand total of approximately 7 million members. The\nPLA has tried to transform itself from a land based power, to a smaller, mobile, high tech\npower that is capable of reaching beyond its borders (Annual Report to Congress 2007;\nChina's National Defense in 2006).\n\nDuring the 1980’s paramount leader Deng Xiaoping pushed for quality over quantity, and the\nmilitary was reduced by one million members. In 1993, President Jiang Zemin officially\nannounced a Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA) a part of the national military strategy for\nmodernization. RMA is a theory about the future of warfare, often connected to\ntechnological and organizational recommendations for change in the United States military\nand others. RMA is tied to modern information, communications, space technology, and\ntotal systems integration. Careful observation of US involvement in the Kosovo,\nAfghanistan, and Iraqi wars, furthered China’s interest in network-centric warfare and\nasymmetric warfare, the former successfully used by the US, and the latter successfully used\nagainst the US. At the turn of the century, the bulk of China’s traditional military force\nremained 1950s to 1970s era technology imported and reverse engineered from Russia.\nChina is seeking to modernize this force. The size of China’s traditional force will shrink, as\nfewer numbers are needed when new technology is introduced (Cordesman and Kleiber 2006;\nCorpus 2006; Moore 2000).\n\n28\n\n\n-----\n\nChina’s defence budget has increased dramatically over the last 15 years. The official\nmilitary budget of China was US$57 billion in 2008, making it the second largest military\nbudget in the world. By contrast, the largest is the US with $623 billion, and the third largest\nis Russia with $50 billion. Japan, South Korea, and India are the next largest spenders in the\nAsia Pacific region with $41 billion, $21 billion, and $19 billion, respectively (World Wide\nMilitary Expenditures 2007). China’s annual defence budget increases at approximately the\nsame rate as its annual GDP, with an average increase of 9% per year since 1996 (Pike 2008;\nChina's National Defense in 2006). However, China’s total military spending may be far\ngreater than the official figures reported. Foreign acquisitions, research and development of\ndual use science and technology, national security, construction, and emergency response and\ndisaster relief, are a few examples of expenditures which may fall under non-military\nheadings but directly relate to the advancement of the military. The US Department of\nDefence estimates China’s total military-related spending for 2007 could be between $97\nbillion and $139 billion. Think tanks and academic institutions report a wide range of\nestimates for China’s defence budget, using varying methodologies and sources, however\nmost arrive at the same conclusion: China significantly under-reports its defence expenditures\n(Annual Report to Congress 2008; International Assessment and Strategy Center 2005).\n\n**Ground Force**\n\nThe PLA Ground Force (PLAGF) is the world’s largest, with 1.25 million personnel, or about\n70% of the PLA’s total manpower (Annual Report to Congress 2008). Approximately\n400,000 of these troops are based in the three military regions (MRs) opposite Taiwan.\nAccording to the 2008 Military Balance of the International Institute for Strategic Studies\n(IISS), the PLAGF comprises 18 group armies which include 9 armoured divisions, 3\nmechanised infantry divisions, 24 motorised infantry divisions, 15 infantry divisions, two\namphibious assault divisions, one mechanised infantry brigade, 22 motorised infantry\nbrigades, 12 armoured brigades, 7 artillery divisions, 14 artillery brigades, and nine antiaircraft artillery missile brigades. China’s military doctrine places an emphasis on electronic\nand information warfare, long-range precision strikes, surface-to-air missiles, special\noperations forces, army aviation helicopters, and satellite communications. The PLAGF\ncontinues to reduce its overall size, opting for a more high tech and mobile force (China's\nNational Defense in 2006).\n\nWhile much of the equipment remains antiquated, China is continually upgrading. This\nincludes approximately 200 Type 98 and Type 99 main battle tanks now deployed to units in\nthe Beijing and Shenyang MRs. As many as 6,000 tanks were produced by China in the\n1960’s. From the early 1970’s to 2000, China’s tank inventory remained around 10,000.\nThis was mostly composed of old Soviet tanks and Chinese versions of old Soviet designs.\nChina continually upgraded over the decades, but was always one step behind the current\nSoviet models. The Chinese-produced versions of the Soviet T-54A (Type 59 and Type 69)\naccount for over two-thirds of the total PLA tank inventory. While retiring some of the older\nType 59/69 series and replacing them with the second generation Type 88 and Type 96, the\nPLA is also upgrading the remaining Type 59/69 series tanks with new technologies\nincluding improved communication and fire-control systems, night vision equipment,\nexplosive reactive armour, improved power plant, and gun-fired anti-tank missiles so that\nthey can remain in service as mobile fire-support platforms. China’s newest tank, the Type\n99, entered PLA service in 2001. Maintenance of such a massive force becomes a problem,\nand many of China’s tanks may have fallen into disrepair. This may also be a push for\nmodernizing to a smaller but more effective force (Armoured Fighting Vehicles 2008).\n\n29\n\n\n-----\n\nThe PLAGF’s hand guns further illustrate China’s attempts to modernize and catch up by\nmeans of foreign acquisition and reverse engineering. Most of China’s weapons are derived\nfrom Soviet models acquired before the Sino-Soviet split in late 1950s and early 1960s.\nExamples include Soviet or Russian small arms like the Mosin-Nagant series rifles and\ncarbines, the SKS carbine, the AK-47 assault rifle, the RPD light-machine gun, the Tokarev\nTT33 pistol, and the DShK heavy machine gun. The PLA’s main infantry rifle, the QBZ-95\nis derived from the Russian AK-47, and the Chinese Type 56 Assault Rifle is a direct copy,\nalbeit locally produced and with a permanently attached bayonet with a more sword-like,\nstiletto style. The Chinese Type 56 Assault Rifle, a locally produced version of the SKS, also\ndiffers from its Russian counterpart by having a permanently attached bayonet. The Chinese\nType 56 was mass produced from the 1960’s to 1980’s and was exported to many states\naround the world (Small Arms 2008).\n\n**Navy**\n\nThe People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) is composed of 250,000 personnel divided into\nthree major fleets, the North Sea Fleet, East Sea Fleet, and South Sea Fleet, each containing\nsurface ships, submarines, naval air force, coastal defence, and marine units. China’s naval\nforce includes 57 attack submarines, 55 medium and heavy amphibious ships, and 49 coastal\nmissile patrol craft. A priority has been placed on anti-air capabilities with improvements in\nover-the-horizon targeting, range, and accuracy in surface-to-air missiles. “Taking\ninformationization as the goal and strategic focus in its modernization drive, the Navy gives\nhigh priority to the development of maritime information systems, and new-generation\nweaponry and equipment” (China's National Defense in 2006). As a part of PLAN’s\nmodernization program, PLAN has been developing blue water navy capabilities.\n\nPLAN does not currently have an aircraft carrier. However, evidence suggests they are\npursing such technology and have the capability to construct one. Renovation to a former\nSoviet Kuznetsov-class aircraft carrier may be used for training purposes, and the Chinese\nhave expressed interest in acquiring Russian Su-33 carrier-borne fighters. The ex-Australian\ncarrier Melbourne also provided research for the PLAN as it was towed to China for scrap.\nRussian assistance, coupled with an already capable ship building infrastructure, could allow\nPLAN to rapidly develop an aircraft carrier. The PLAN's ambitions include operating out to\nthe first and second island chains, extending operations to the South Pacific near Australia,\nnorth to the Aleutian Islands, and west to the Strait of Malacca towards the Indian Ocean\n(Annual Report to Congress 2008).\n\nChina’s submarine fleet is derived from outdated Russian technology and is seeking to\nbecome a more modern and smaller force. Early Chinese submarines were domestically\nproduced versions of the Soviet Romeo class submarine, which were only capable of coastal\npatrols with deployment to sea limited to a few days per year. One Romeo was modified to\ncarry six YJ-1 (C-801) anti-ship missiles, but it had to surface to fire them. The Chinese\nMing class submarines produced in the 1970s were not much better, other than being of\nnewer construction. This was followed by the Song class submarine, which had a\nstreamlined hull and can be fitted with anti-ship missiles capable of being fired while\nsubmerged. China returned to purchasing subs in the late 1990s with the Russian Kilo class\nsubmarine. The Type 041 Yuan Class is the newest diesel-electric submarine in the PLAN.\nIts design incorporates parts of the Song class and Russian Kilo class submarines. The Yuan\nclass has five torpedo tubes capable of launching indigenous torpedos as well as Russian\n\n30\n\n\n-----\n\ndesigned torpedos, and it is believed to have anti-ship missiles. This ship was designed to\nreplace the aging Romeo and Ming class submarines which currently form the backbone of\nthe PLAN’s submarine fleet (Chinese Submarines 2008; see also China’s Navy 2007).\n\nChinese produced Han class nuclear submarines were plagued with problems. A follow-on\nType 093 nuclear submarine was developed with experience from the Han class and further\nassistance from Russian submarine builders, such as advanced wielding and construction\ntechniques. Despite being armed with new Chinese wire-guided torpedoes; the Type 093’s\noverall capability remains comparable to Russian technology of the late 1970s. Nevertheless,\nChina continues to make progress and the true level of Russian assistance lacks transparency\n(Smith 2001). Further, the Type 093 may have benefited from German fuel cell technology\nand French design, which could allow for two to three weeks of submerged operations\nwithout having to surface to recharge batteries. Internet-source photos of Type 039s under\nconstruction also show Chinese mastery of advanced multi-layer rubber/polymer hull\ncoatings that greatly reduce hull-radiated noise while limiting the effectiveness of activesonar detection (Chinese Submarines 2008).\n\nChina maintains a fleet of approximately 28 destroyers, 48 frigates, and 30 ocean-capable fast\nattack craft. The frigates were designed for anti-surface warfare, and lacking significant selfdefence. Chinese-built destroyers include the Luhu class, the Luhai class, and the Luda\nI/II/III, from oldest to newest, respectively. The Luhai and Luda class are armed with a\nbattery of guns, torpedos, mortars, optional helicopter pads, and domestically built Crotale\nSAMs which were built from designs provided by France in the 1980s. Construction of the\nLuhai class was delayed from the mid 1980s to the mid 1990s due to construction of frigates\nfor the Thai Navy. The most powerful addition to the PLAN is the Russian-built\nSovremenny class destroyers. These include MOSKIT anti-ship missiles and KASHTAN\ncombined gun/missile ship defence systems. While these designs are non-stealth 1970s\nRussian technology, outdated by current designs, they provided the PLAN with modern antiship, anti-air, and anti-submarine systems. The most recent Sovremenny acquisitions carry 8\nSunburn supersonic sea-skimming ASM and the SA-N-7 Gadfly, which will give PLAN\nlimited naval air-defence capability. Up to this point, China only possessed short-range\nSAMs of French or domestic design (Surface Combatants 2008; IISS 2008).\n\nImprovements in stealth design of the PLAN’s ships further the notion that China seeks to\nmodernize by purchasing or clandestinely obtaining technology from other states, reverse\nengineering that technology, and then attempting to make upgraded domestically produced\nversions. According to Frank Moore of the Institute for Defence and Disarmament Studies:\n\nThe PLA developed new stealthy warships benefiting from Russian or Ukrainian design\nadvice, weapons, electronics and other systems, plus new computer aided design methods\nwhich speeded their development. By 2002 it was possible to observe the construction of\nthree new classes of warships via Chinese internet sources ... the No. 168 class, which\narmed with Russian SHTIL SAMs, Russian radar, Kamov Ka-28 ASW helicopters and\nChinese C-802/803 anti-ship missiles, and powered by Ukrainian gas turbine engines. Soon\nafter two No. 170 class destroyers were launched. These featured large phased array radar\nsimilar in appearance to the U.S. AEGIS system... Most likely the new \"AEGIS\" radar comes\nfrom the Ukrainian KVANT bureau and is a newly-developed active phased array radar with a\nbroad search range of about 150km ... In 2003 [PLAN] launched two Type 054 stealthy\nfrigates. Some sources indicate production was halted at two ships pending the completion of\na new Russian SAM... In early 2004 internet-source pictures of a model of this new variant,\napparently from a Chinese shipbuilding exhibition, confirmed that it will feature a new verticallaunched SAM and be outfitted with Russian radar and missile guidance systems. The Type\n054 is also powered by co-produced French-designed SEMT Pielstick marine diesel engines.\n\n31\n\n\n-----\n\nA fourth stealthy warship emerged in April 2004: a new fast-attack craft (FAC). Now being\nproduced at two or three shipyards, this new FAC utilizes a wave-piercing catamaran (twin)\nhull design, which improves stability at high speeds even in rough seas. It is based on a\ndesign obtained from the Australian fast-ferry firm AMD... [with] radar-absorbing materials\napplied to the hull. (Moore 2000).\n\nNot only does this illustrate China’s use of foreign technology, it also demonstrates the\ncomplexity of modern warfare. These are highly sophisticated weapons, weapons pieced\ntogether from multiple sources, the existence of which was leaked onto the internet.\n\n**Air Force**\n\nThe People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) is the third largest air force in the world\nbehind the United States and Russia. The PLAAF employs 250,000 personnel and 1,762\ncombat aircraft (IISS 2008). The Soviet Union helped found the PLAAF in 1949, providing\naircraft in 1951, and production technology and pilot training in 1953. China gained limited\nair combat experience during the Korean War. In 1956 China began assembling its own\naircraft based on Soviet design, such as the J-2, J-5, and J-6, copies of the MiG-15, Mig-17,\nand Mig-19 respectively. The Sino-Soviet split was a significant setback to the PLAAF as\nwas resource competition with the missile and nuclear divisions of the military. China’s\naircraft industry received a boost during the Vietnam War by providing aircraft for North\nVietnam.\n\nDuring the 1980s, the PLAAF underwent significant restructuring, opting for a more\nstreamlined force and increased training. Due to the Sino-Soviet Split, the PLAAF turned to\nWestern states for military expertise. Western states saw China as a counterbalance to the\nSoviet Union; however support dissolved following the 1989 Tiananmen Square incident.\nReverse engineering of Soviet weaponry continued with the Chinese aircraft F-7 being an\nillegitimate copy of the MiG-21, and the F-8 incorporating various Soviet designs.\nGorbachev’s 1989 visit to China marked an end to the Sino-Soviet split. The newborn and\neconomically struggling state of Russia used the transfer of military technology and expertise\nto China as a way to sustain its own aerospace industry (Moore 2000).\n\nThe collapse of The Soviet Union, and concerns over a Taiwan conflict that could draw in the\nUnited States, reinvigorated the PLAAF’s modernization program. In the 1990s, China\nbegan development of fourth generation fighters, including the J-10 and a collaboration with\nPakistan on the JF-17. China continued focusing on improved pilot training and retiring\nobsolete aircraft, preferring quality over quantity. The PLAAF is currently developing its\nown fifth generation stealth craft and increasing Command, Control, Communications,\nComputers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems for all its\nfighters.\n\nIn addition to jet fighter aircraft, “China is upgrading its B-6 bomber fleet (originally adapted\nfrom the Russian Tu-16) with a new variant which, when operational, will be armed with a\nnew long-range cruise missile” (Annual Report to Congress 2008). China is also developing\nAirborne Early Warning and Control (AEW&C) aircraft utilizing Russian and possibly Israeli\ntechnology; and is making progress in tanker aircraft used for in-flight refuelling and airlift\nplanes. These are important steps in obtaining the capability to conduct operations beyond\nChina’s borders (China's National Defense in 2006; Allen 2005).\n\n32\n\n\n-----\n\nProduction of indigenous Chinese aircraft has been lacklustre. Most of the designs require\nforeign expertise which is then reverse engineered. The technology obtained is often one\ngeneration old at the time of acquisition, as states do not want to give up their advantage.\nFurther, to reverse engineer they not only need the aircraft itself, but also high-precision and\ntechnologically advanced machine tools, electronics and components, skilled personnel, and\nfacilities. By the time the technology is fully understood, and indigenous versions produced,\nthe aircraft may be two or three generations behind the latest models of the world’s advanced\nmilitary forces. China is not alone in this difficulty. Except for the five largest industrial\narms producers (France, Germany, Russia, the UK, and the US), other countries that have\nattempted to produce indigenously designed combat aircraft, such as Israel, South Africa,\nIndia, Taiwan, and South Korea, have abandoned their efforts and returned to importing\nsystems from one of the five main producers. One reason is the economy of scale involved\nwith financing research, development, and production of all of the systems and sub-systems\nthat compose modern combat aircraft (Moore 2000; see also Allen, Krumel and Pollack\n1995). Despite these difficulties, China remains committed to producing indigenous aircraft.\nContinued purchase of foreign technology demonstrates that the Chinese believe reverse\nengineering and then upgrading is the best approach to establish themselves as a selfsufficient producer in the future. In other words, the PRC aspires to become one of the elite\nweapons producers, but it does not want to wait for the infrastructure to evolve; it wants to\nleapfrog these capabilities.\n\n**Space**\n\nThe PLA is responsible for the Chinese space program. China was the fifth nation in the\nworld to place a satellite in orbit, the third nation to put a human into space, and the third\nnation to successfully test an anti-satellite weapon (ASAT) capable of destroying an enemy\nsatellite in low earth orbit. China’s manned space activities have received substantial support\nfrom Russia. This can be seen in the design of the Shenzhou spacecraft, which closely\nresembles the Russian Soyuz spacecraft. Although China’s commercial space program has\nutility for non-military research, it also demonstrates space launch and control capabilities\nthat have direct military application. All taikonauts have been selected from members of the\nPLAAF, and the PLA has deployed space-based systems for military purposes. These\ninclude imagery intelligence satellite systems such as the ZiYan series and JianBing series,\nsynthetic aperture satellites (SAR) such as JianBing-5, the BeiDou satellite navigation\nnetwork, and secured communication satellites such as FengHuo-1. China launched its 100th\nLong March series rocket in 2007, and continues to put more sophisticated and diverse\nsatellites into orbit. The PRC is developing the Long March 5, an improved heavy-lift rocket\nthat will be able to lift larger reconnaissance satellites into low-earth orbit or communications\nsatellites into geosynchronous orbits by 2012. It expects to replace all foreign-produced\nsatellites in its inventory with indigenously produced sun-synchronous and geo-stationary\nmodels by 2010 (Annual Report to Congress 2008; Center for Strategic and International\nStudies 2003).\n\nMany of China’s space assets are dual use, having financial and prestige benefits in addition\nto military applications. The Ziyuan-2 series, the Yaogan-1 and -2, the Haiyang-1B, the\nCBERS-1 and -2 satellites, and the Huanjing satellites, offer ocean surveillance, disaster and\nenvironmental monitoring, and high resolution imaging in the visible, infrared, and radar\nspectrums. New electro-optical satellites are capable of penetrating night and weather with a\n1/10 meter resolution, providing near continuous targeting data for the PLA forces. In the\narena of navigation and timing, China has five BeiDou satellites with 20 meter accuracy over\n\n33\n\n\n-----\n\nthe region. The PRC also uses the Russian GLONASS navigation system and is a primary\ninvestor in the European Union’s Galileo navigation system. China has developed small\nsatellite design and production facilities, and is developing microsatellites, satellites which\nweigh less than 100 kilograms. These satellites offer remote sensing, imagery, and radar, and\ncould allow China to rapidly replace or expand its satellite force in the event of war or a\ndisruption to the network. The country is also improving its ability to track and identify\nforeign satellites, which is an essential component in the event of counter-space operations.\nChina’s successful test of an ASAT weapon demonstrates an ability to strike enemy assets in\nlow earth orbit. This acts as a deterrent to conflict and demonstrates the PRC’s commitment\nto relatively low-cost asymmetric warfare (International Assessment and Strategy Center\n2005).\n\n**Second Artillery Corps**\n\nThe Second Artillery Corps (SAC) controls the PLA’s nuclear and conventional missile\nforces. Weapons from the SAC are subsequently filtered to other branches of the PLA.\nItems such as the land attack cruise missile (LACM) may be used by the PLAAF on H-6\nbombers, or by the PLAN on Type 093 nuclear submarines. China's total nuclear arsenal is\nestimated to be between 120 and 250. China maintains a “no first use” policy; however, the\nambiguous nature of declaratory policies leave open the option for first strike if China’s\nleaders believe their national security or the CPC are under threat.\n\nChina began developing nuclear weapons in the late 1950s with the help of Soviet assistance.\nAfter the Sino-Soviet split in the late 1950s, China continued its development on its own and\nmade significant progress. The People’s Republic detonated its first atomic bomb in 1964,\nmaking it the fifth state to do so, following the United States, Russia, the United Kingdom,\nand France. With the addition of India and Pakistan, and possibly Israel and North Korea,\nChina remains only one of nine states with a nuclear capability. China launched its first\nnuclear missile in 1966, and detonated its first hydrogen bomb in 1967. Short-range ballistic\nmissile (SRBM) capability was obtained with the development of the Dongfeng-1, mediumrange ballistic missile (MRBM) capability with the Dongfeng-2, intermediate-range ballistic\nmissile (IRBM) capability with the Dongfeng-3, and limited intercontinental ballistic missile\n(ICBM) capability with the Dongfeng-5 (Missile and Space Programme 2008; Second\nArtillery Corps 2000).\n\nIt is estimated that China has 24-36 liquid fuelled ICBMs capable of striking the US and\napproximately 100-150 IRBMs capable of striking Russia and Eastern Europe.  China also\npossesses approximately 1,000 SRBMs with ranges between 300 and 600 km. Beijing is\ncontinually upgrading the range, accuracy, and payload capability of its SRBMs at a rate of\n100 new missiles per year. Its most current missile, the Dongfeng-31A is a solid fuel ICBM\nwith a range of 11,200km. It is road mobile, and has multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs). As noted above, China possesses submarine-launched ballistic\nmissiles (SLBMs) on its SSBN submarines. The PLAAF also has bombers capable of\ndelivering nuclear bombs. However, they would be unlikely to break through the modern air\ndefence systems of advanced military powers. The SAC has sought to improve its retaliatory\nstrike capability by hardening missile silos, developing mobile launchers, and increasing\nrange, accuracy, and response time of its missile system (Annual Report to Congress 2008;\nsee also Wortzel 2007).\n\n34\n\n\n-----\n\nChina’s non-nuclear missile arsenal continues to develop anti-access/area denial capabilities.\nThese include the land attack cruise missile (LACM) DH-10, the Russian SUNBURN antiship cruise missile (ASCM), the Russian SIZZLER supersonic ASCM, and indigenous\nversions of anti-ship missiles based on their own MRBMs. The acquisition of Russian arms\ndemonstrates China’s continued commitment to technology transfer and reverse engineering.\nThus, “The DH-10 will be similar in size and capability to the U.S. TOMOHAWK, in part\nbecause the PLA has been collecting parts of this U.S. cruise missile from Iraq and\nAfghanistan. The PLA has obtained at least six Russian Kh-55 cruise missiles from the\nUkraine, and reportedly, has benefited from Israeli cruise missile technology associated with\nthe DELILAH anti-radar missile” (Moore 2000). Asymmetric warfare, another tendency of\nthe PLA, is shown by its research into manoeuvring re-entry vehicles (MaRV), decoys, chaff,\njamming, thermal shielding, and ASAT weapons that will strengthen deterrence and strike\ncapabilities.  Many of these technologies can also be used to defeat, deter, or stymie US\nattempts at a National Missile Defence shield. By examining the weapons and deployment of\nthe SAC, China’s perceived primary threats can be identified. The majority of the SAC’s\nSRBMs are opposite Taiwan. DF-11 Mod 1s are capable of carrying thermobaric and cluster\nmunitions as well as high-explosives. In addition, they may carry radiofrequency/electromagnetic pulse (EMP) warheads which, if used in sufficient numbers, could\ndisable electronic communications and electric power networks (Annual Report to Congress\n2008).\n\n**People’s Armed Police**\n\nThe People’s Armed Police (PAP) is no longer the official fifth service branch of the PLA;\nhowever it remains an integral part of Chinese defence. The line between military operations\nagainst foreign elements and operations of internal security are often blurred. This can be\nseen all the way down to the PAP uniforms which differ only slightly from PLAGF, often\nleading foreigners to mistake them as soldiers. In contrast, public security officers wear dark\ngray or blue uniforms more common among Western police forces. Much of the PAP force\nwas absorbed directly from the PLA. They use a similar rank structure, and they obey the\nPLA’s general regulations. PAP guards are also recruited at the same time and through the\nsame procedures as PLA soldiers. The PAP has a dual command structure including the\nCentral Military Commission (CMC) and the State Council through the Ministry of Public\nSecurity. By law the PAP is not part of the PLA; however, their interconnection is\nunavoidable, and the PAP will play an important role as domestic or non-military issues\nbecome intertwined with traditional military issues (People's Armed Police Force\nOrganisation 2007; Tkacik 2007).\n\nThe PAP is a paramilitary force primarily responsible for law enforcement. China’s National\nDefence White Paper, published in 2006, lists the total strength of the PAP at 660,000. The\nIISS Military Balance of 2008 lists an estimated 1.5 million (IISS 2008). The PAP has its\norigins in the PLA, which was originally tasked with both defending China from foreign\nthreats and providing internal security. While the two share much in common, China\neventually decided the differences were greater than the similarities. The PAP's primary\nmission is internal security. They are responsible for guarding government buildings at all\nlevels, including party and state organisations, foreign embassies, consulates, and airports.\nThe PAP provides personal protection to senior government officials, and performs security\nfunctions for major corporations and public events – including its much-publicized role in the\n2008 Beijing Olympics (see Paramilitary Olympics 2008). Additionally, the PAP maintains\nmultiple counter-terrorism units, sea and land border security forces, fire fighting units, and\n\n35\n\n\n-----\n\nhas a role in the protection of forests, gold mines, hydroelectric facilities, and highway\ninfrastructure. The secondary mission of the PAP is external defence, and in times of war\nPAP internal security units can act as light infantry supporting the PLA in local defence\nmissions. Similarly, the PLA can fill in for the PAP and has done so during the Cultural\nRevolution, the Tiananmen Square incident, and flooding of the Yellow River (People's\nArmed Police Force Organisation 2007; China's National Defense in 2006; People’s Armed\nPolice 2005).\n\n**Military Intelligence**\n\nThe General Staff Department carries out staff and operational functions for the PLA and is\nresponsible for implementing military modernization plans. It serves as the headquarters for\nthe PLAGF and contains directorates for the PLAN, PLAAF, and SAC, as well as a\ndepartment for electronic warfare. The General Staff Department also includes subdepartments for artillery, armoured units, communications, engineering, mobilization,\noperations, politics, training, and surveying. Direct control over the four military branches is\nsub-divided among the General Staff Department and regional commanders; however the\nGeneral Staff Department can assume direct operation control at any time. The General Staff\nDepartment is under the control of the Central Military Commission (General Staff\nDepartment 1997).\n\nThe Second Department of the General Staff Headquarters is responsible for collecting\nmilitary intelligence. This includes military attachés at Chinese embassies abroad,\nclandestine agents to conduct espionage, and the analysis of publicly available data published\nby foreign countries. The Second Department oversees military human intelligence\n(HUMINT), open source intelligence (OSINT), and satellite and aerial imagery intelligence\n(IMINT) which it disseminates to the Central Military Commission and various branches.\nThe Second Department has increased its focus on scientific and technological military\nintelligence gathering. The Third Department of the General Staff Headquarters is\nresponsible for monitoring the telecommunications of foreign militaries and producing\nreports based on the military information gathered. China operates the most extensive signals\nintelligence (SIGINT) network of all the countries in the Asia-Pacific region. Since the\n1950s, the Second and Third Departments have maintained a number of secondary and higher\nlearning institutions for producing recruits, particularly in foreign languages. The Third\nDepartment not only intercepts communication of foreign militaries, but also those of the\nPLA, thereby maintaining control and supervision over the different branches and\ncommanders within all of the military regions (Second Intelligence Department 2005,\nGeneral Staff Department 1997).\n\nOther branches of the General Staff Department include the Fourth Department and the\nGeneral Political Department (GPD). The Fourth Department (ECM and Radar) is\nresponsible for electronic intelligence (ELINT) including electronic countermeasures and\nmaintaining databases on electronic signals. The GPD is responsible for overseeing the\npolitical education required for advancement within the PLA and controls the PLA’s internal\nprison system. The International Liaison Department, a branch within the GPD, conducts\npropaganda, psychological operations (PSYOPS), and counter-espionage against foreign\nintelligence. As with the PAP, many of the departments within the General Staff Department\nappear to have significant overlap. The structural details are beyond the scope of this study;\nhowever, they are worth noting, as they pertain to the discussion below of cyber warfare.\n\n36\n\n\n-----\n\n**Technology Transfer**\n\nChina continues to pursue the acquisition of foreign military technology. Beijing is in\nongoing negotiations with Moscow to obtain multiple weapons systems, and in 2007 signed\narms agreements worth $150 million. Israel has previously supplied advanced military\ntechnology to China. However, under pressure from the US, Israel began to implement strict\nmilitary export regulations. China is attempting to remove an embargo placed on lethal\nmilitary export from the EU. This embargo was a response to the Tiananmen Square\nincident. Opinion on removing the embargo remains divided among EU member states.\nAccording to the 2008 Annual Report to Congress on China’s Military:\n\nChina continues a systematic effort to obtain dual-use and military technologies from abroad\nthrough legal and illegal commercial transactions. Many dual-use technologies, such as\nsoftware, integrated circuits, computers, electronics, semiconductors, telecommunications,\nand information security systems, are vital for the PLA’s transformation into an informationbased, network-enabled force.\n\nBetween 1995 and 2008, several high profile cases of Chinese espionage against the US\nsurfaced. These attempts targeted aerospace programs, space shuttle design, F-16 design,\nsubmarine propulsion, C4ISR data, high-performance computers, nuclear weapons design,\ncruise missile data, semiconductors, integrated circuit design, and details of US arms sales to\nTaiwan. Targeted organisations include Northrop Grumman, NASA, Los Alamos\nLaboratories, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Sun Microsystems, and various defence installations.\nThe Chinese do not limit themselves to high value targets or an elite group of agents. They\nobtain any data which may be of value, including legally obtained documents or OSINT,\nwhich may help them piece together the larger picture. China utilizes a decentralized\nnetwork of students, business people, scientists, diplomats, and engineers from within the\nChinese Diaspora. The majority of these individuals have legitimate purposes within the host\nstate; however they are recruited at a later date, or asked for small pieces of information or\nfavours which can seem harmless in scope to the individual. Attempts are also made to\npurchase interests within high technology companies, as well as win political favour with\ngovernment officials. For example, there have been repeated allegations that President Bill\nClinton’s decision to sell sophisticated computer and satellite technology to China was\ninfluenced by campaign contributions (Appel 2004; Cooper 2006; Grier 2005; Jordan 2008;\nWarrick and Johnson 2008; Lynch 2007; Cox Report 1999; McLaughlin 1999; PRC\nAcquisitions of US Technology 1998).\n\nChina’s use of espionage to obtain foreign military technology is not restricted to the US. In\n2007, the head of a Russian rocket and space technology company was sentenced to 11 years\nfor passing sensitive information to China. An alleged agent who defected in Belgium\nclaimed hundreds of Chinese spies were working within Europe’s industries. These\nallegations coincided with an arrest in France for illegal database intrusion of the automotive\ncomponents manufacturer Valeo, and a guest researcher in Sweden arrested for stealing\nunpublished and unpatented research. Further, Chinese diplomat Chen Yonglin defected to\nAustralia in 2005, claiming there were over 1,000 Chinese secret agents and informants\nwithin Australia (Luard 2005; Isachenkov 2007). Espionage and technology transfer prosper\nin cyber warfare, where being physically present is not required, and attribution becomes\nincreasingly difficult. It also falls in line with China’s strategy of leapfrogging. By acquiring\nforeign military knowledge, China can quickly catch up and begin working at a comparable\nlevel, rather than investing the large amounts of time and effort it would take to acquire this\nknowledge independently.\n\n37\n\n\n-----\n\n**Doctrine/Strategy**\n\nChinese military doctrine and strategy remain focused on modernization. Beijing has not\nexplicitly laid out an official grand strategy. This may be due to disagreement within the\ngovernment, or done intentionally to hide true motives and avoid being bound by them.\nMuch of the writings published by the PRC are contradictory or ambiguous, using modern\nand ancient foundations, while being disseminated by varied sources. However, several\npoints which are continually emphasized may point to a general consensus. These include\nmodernization of weapons, equipment and training; accelerating the RMA; improving\neducation and training of the PLA and the CPC; “informationized” (xinxihua) warfare; and\nscientific development. China seeks to maintain domestic and regional stability while\ndeveloping its economic, military, technologic, scientific, and soft power. It also seeks a\nbalance between military and economic development, believing they are mutually dependant.\nBeijing maintains its One China Policy in relation to Taiwan, and claims sovereignty over the\nParcel and Spratly islands and adjacent waterways (China's National Defense 2006).\n\nDeng Xiaoping, representing second generation leadership after Mao, sought to avoid\ninternational responsibilities and limitations, as they could slow down development of the\nmilitary and economy. The third generation leadership of Jiang Zemin did look outward,\npromoting a multipolar world in the face of the post-Cold War unipolarity under the US, just\nas fourth generation leader Hu Jintao promoted the ideology of a Harmonious World (hexie\n_shijie) which places more emphasis on international relations (Lam 2004; Zheng and Tok_\n2007). However the PRC continues to avoid concrete stances through concepts of noninterference, diversity, and equality. It compares itself to other states through Comprehensive\nNational Power (CNP - _zonghe guoli), using qualitative and quantitative values, and not_\naccepting traditional Western categorizations (see Pillsbury 2000). For example, China\nincludes the economy, soft power, and domestic stability as factors of CNP. This is\nimportant, because it shows a correlativity which holds relevance for cyber warfare.  Under\nCNP the economy, soft power, and domestic stability can be seen as military matters.\nFurther, maintaining the status quo in regards to Taiwan and the Spratly islands may not be\nChina’s long-term intention, but rather a way to stall efforts while it builds up military\nstrength, strength which can include economic and international influence.\n\nDespite not wanting to become embroiled in concrete commitments to military strategy,\nChinese leaders cannot ignore the interconnectedness of the modern world, and they have\nrealized the necessity of international cooperation. For example, the need for resources has\nfuelled China’s global presence. The PRC is the world’s second largest importer of\npetroleum. As the country’s economy grows and the middle class expands, the demand for\nfossil fuel resources will continue to grow. This creates a need for sound international\nrelations with exporting nations and the need for securing transportation routes, such as the\nStrait of Malacca and the South China Sea. These are intertwined with the politics and\nmilitary affairs of the states involved. Competition with the US for these resources has often\nled to China making agreements with nations the US opposes on several points, such as\nAngola, Chad, Egypt, Indonesia, Iran, Kazakhstan, Nigeria, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Sudan,\nVenezuela, and Yemen (Hanson 2008; Brookes 2006).\n\nBeijing may be using these countries simply because there is less competition for resource\naccess in the case of these suppliers. However, the result is often international criticism of\nChina as these states may be violating human rights or supporting terrorism. Moreover,\n\n38\n\n\n-----\n\nBeijing’s methods of befriending these exporters comes into question, especially in regards to\narms being traded or availability of finance which may be supporting controversial policies.\nChina currently lacks the power projection to protect critical sea lanes from disruption or to\ndeter international criticism. Crucial to extended power projection is the blue water navy\nwhich would benefit from online technology transfer and the further development of C4ISR.\nOnline PSYOPS and media warfare would enhance China’s soft power. Beijing believes that\neconomic growth is critical to military development; economic growth creates a greater\nenergy demand, which in turns creates a greater military demand, thus the two form a\npositive feedback loop (Ikenberry 2008; China's National Defense in 2006).\n\nWhile Beijing recognizes the need for international cooperation, it remains cautious. The\ncountry suffered greatly from foreign incursions within the last century. Colonialism by\nWestern powers, Japanese occupation in World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War,\nand border conflicts with India, the Soviet Union, and Vietnam are all kept fresh through\nChina’s historical discourse. Despite China’s long history, these events are of special note as\nthey are within living memory, and these events were present during the founding and\nduration of the CPC’s rule.\n\nEnsuring the survival of the CPC shapes China’s strategic outlook. In order to bolster\ndomestic support for policies, nationalism has been emphasized over communist ideology.\nThis can be seen with government organised protests against Japan over visits by Japanese\nleaders to WWII war shrines and protests against the publishing of Japanese school text\nbooks which downplay Japan’s atrocities against the Chinese. These protests often coincide\nwith other strategic interests, such as territorial disputes in the East China Sea, which are\noften unbeknownst to the casual observer or participant. The mobilization of nationalism can\nalso be seen during the holding of a US reconnaissance plane in 2001, and the mistaken\nbombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade in 1999. The 2008 Olympics further\ndemonstrated how China could garner national support in the face of a widening wealth gap,\nforced relocation, corruption, and environmental degradation. These events demonstrate a\nstrategic value in public manipulation through nationalism; one that is interconnected with\nmilitary affairs, and one which is increasingly turning to online assets (see Faiola 2005).\n\nSeveral conclusions can be drawn from the status of the PLA. China is committed to\nmodernizing its military, primarily through the purchase or illicit acquisition of foreign\ntechnology and subsequently reverse engineering that technology so it can be produced\ndomestically. The PLA has placed an importance on trimming down its size, favouring\nquality over quantity. The PLA’s weaponry often lags one or two generations behind that of\nWestern military powers. However, the total force base still poses a significant deterrent, and\nestablishes China as a dominant power within the Asia-Pacific Region. China lacks force\nprojection beyond its region, primarily do to the lack of a blue water navy and aircraft carrier\nfleet, but also due to limits in missile technology and air-defence penetration, and opposition\nby foreign powers such as the United States. China seeks to become self-sufficient in many\nof these key capabilities. Once they have leapfrogged and are no longer trying to catch up,\nthe Chinese will no longer need such widescale technology transfer, and they will possess the\nmight to shape the international system, rather than be bound by one that was created by\nforeign powers.\n\n39\n\n\n-----\n\n**2.** **A New Era**\n\nHistory has demonstrated that the advantage often goes to those who develop a technology\nfirst. The great naval voyages of Ming admiral Zhang He were unprecedented for their time\nand helped establish China as a suzerain of the wider Asian region. However, the mid-15th\ncentury saw China retreat to xenophobic and isolationist policies that paved the way towards\nChina’s decline and opened the door for colonialism (see Dick 2006). This lesson has not\nbeen lost among Chinese officials, and it is often used to spur initiatives such as their stated\ndesire to be the first to mine the moon for helium-3 (China’s Space Program 2005). The\ninformation revolution has given more power to individuals and increased globalization\nthrough the interconnectedness of economies, rapid dissemination of news, and improved\naccess to communication and information of all types. Any attempt to compete on a global\nlevel without the use of these technologies would place the PRC at a significant military and\nfinancial disadvantage. For this reason, the benefits of electronic reliance outweigh the risks\ninvolved. Further, it is impossible for a state to develop a defence against cyber warfare\nwithout simultaneously learning how to execute attacks themselves.\n\nThe US is the sole superpower, making it a benchmark for military competitiveness. Beijing\nalso views the US as a potential adversary, in particular due to perceptions of the US military\nattempting to encircle China with bases in nearby states and opposition to China’s\nmodernization goals, to concerns over any forceful application of the One China Policy, and\nto concerns over a range of internal affairs issues. China seeks to learn from US mistakes and\nsuccesses, using American expertise and field-tested military experience to accelerate\nChina’s development. The People’s Republic also focuses on weaknesses in the US military\nin order to improve upon the American example and to expose asymmetric advantages. For\nthese reasons it is important to examine where the US is headed in military thinking and\ndevelopment, as China is likely to follow (Derene 2008; Lasker 2005; Liang Xiangsui 1999).\n\n**Network-Centric Warfare**\n\nThe US has viewed the internet as a potential tool of warfare since its inception. Arpanet, a\nprecursor of modern internet, was heavily funded by the US military, with a particular\nemphasis on its research collaboration benefits. Despite fears of cyber terrorism post 9/11,\nthe US continues to place increasing reliance on the internet as a security tool. This can be\nseen in the restructuring of US intelligence agencies and the creation of new online exchange\nsuch as Intellipedia and A-Space (Shaughnessy 2008; Magnuson 2006). Militarily, the\ninformation revolution has given rise to an increasing reliance on situational awareness,\nweather monitoring, surveillance, communication, and precision strikes. Chinese military\nstrategists have made special note of the US reliance on, and dominance with, electronic\nmeans in the Kosovo, Afghanistan, and Iraqi conflicts (Tellis 2007; Center for Strategic and\nInternational Studies 2003; Liang and Xiangsui 1999).\n\nSince the 1990s the US has put emphasis on developing network-centric warfare (NCW).\nNCW seeks to translate an information advantage, enabled in part by information technology,\ninto a military advantage through the networking of well informed, geographically-dispersed\nforces. Originally described as a system of systems, it includes intelligence sensors,\ncommand and control systems, and precision weapons that enable enhanced situational\nawareness, rapid target assessment, and distributed weapon assignment. In essence, NCW\ntranslates to information superiority, which requires the reduction of hard categorization,\nbecause compartmentalizing military branches can stem the flow of information. In 2001, the\n\n40\n\n\n-----\n\nPentagon began investing in peer-to-peer software as a means to spread information while\nsupplying redundancy and robustness. The US Department of Defense has sought the\ncreation of the Global Information Grid (GIG) as a backbone of NCW. All advanced\nweapons platforms, sensor systems, and command and control centres are eventually to be\nlinked via the GIG. Collecting, processing, storing, disseminating, and managing classified\nsecurity information on demand will be made globally available to soldiers, policymakers,\nand support personnel to achieve information superiority (Alberts 2002; Alberts, Garstka, and\nStein 2000).\n\nVice President Richard Cheney stated in 2004:\n\nWith less than half of the ground forces and two-thirds of the military aircraft used 12 years\nago in Desert Storm, we have achieved a far more difficult objective . . . . In Desert Storm, it\nusually took up to two days for target planners to get a photo of a target, confirm its\ncoordinates, plan the mission, and deliver it to the bomber crew. Now we have near real-time\nimaging of targets with photos and coordinates transmitted by e-mail to aircraft already in\nflight. In Desert Storm, battalion, brigade, and division commanders had to rely on maps,\ngrease pencils, and radio reports to track the movements of our forces. Today, our\ncommanders have a real-time display of our armed forces on their computer screen\n(Raduege 2004).\n\n**Information Operations**\n\nIn 2003, under the direction of former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, the US\nexpanded on NCW in a document titled the _Information Operations Roadmap. Now_\ndeclassified, it was obtained under the Freedom of Information Act by George Washington\nUniversity’s National Security Archive. Information Operations (IO) calls for NCW to\nbecome a core military branch along with the Army, Navy, Air Force, Intelligence, and\nSpace. To accomplish this it requires the development of a comprehensive education\nprogram to enlist new recruits, and an overhaul of the organizational structure of current\nmilitary branches in an attempt to break down barriers that hinder information exchange and\nprogress. IO activities include PSYOPS troops who try to manipulate the adversary’s\nthoughts and beliefs, military deception and disinformation, media warfare, electronic\nwarfare (EW), and computer network operations (CNO). Thus Information Operations\nRoadmap stands as an another example of the US commitment to transform military\ncapabilities to keep pace with emerging threats and to exploit new opportunities afforded by\ninnovation and rapidly developing information technologies.\n\nIO seeks to “dominate the electromagnetic spectrum”, in an attempt to “deny, degrade,\ndisrupt, or destroy a broad range of adversary threats, sensors, command and control and\ncritical support infrastructures” (Information Operations Roadmap 2003). The document\nnotes that PSYOPS and manipulating the thoughts of populations through media and internet\nrequire constant observation during peacetime, otherwise in the event of conflict, a state\nwould not be sufficiently engrained into the information culture to utilize them fully. This\ncan be seen with the emergence of patriotic hackers, the advancement of social media, and\nthe rapid evolution of memetics, slang, and subcultures, all of which will be discussed further\nbelow (List of Internet Phenomenon 2008; Pang 2008; Slashdot Subculture 2008; Slashdot\nTrolling Phenomenon 2008). IO includes defence, attack, and reconnaissance as vital\ncomponents (Information Operations Roadmap 2003).\n\nIO seeks to put out a political message in coordination with any traditional military assault. It\nplaces an emphasis on finding, and clandestinely promoting, favourable media from third\n\n41\n\n\n-----\n\nparties, so as to appear more credible. IO also seeks to establish a legal framework to defend\nagainst cyber attacks and cyber reconnaissance, as well as establish rules of engagement for\nconducting cyber attack. For example, how much certainty is required in identifying the\nsource of an attack before responding? If an attack is being routed through multiple\ncomputers, is it acceptable to attack the intermediary computer? This would halt the attack\nbut it would harm or destroy a computer which may have been infected without the owner’s\nknowledge or consent. Additionally, an intangible computer attack can result in significant\ntangible loss, but does this warrant the use of traditional military weapons as a response?\n\n**Future Combat Systems**\n\nAnother US project that is gaining attention and closely resembles NCW and IO is Future\nCombat Systems (FCS). FCS places a particular emphasis on advanced robotics, including\nUnmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs), Unmanned Aerial Combat Vehicles (UCAVs), NonLine of Sight Launch Systems, and Unattended Systems. This system of systems seeks to\nmake warfare as networked as the internet, as mobile as a mobile phone, and as intuitive as a\nvideo game. The highly interconnected nature of FCS can even be seen in its development,\nutilizing 550 contractors in 41 US states. While the US has yet to determine a definitive\nname for this new type of information based, highly networked, and highly technological\nwarfare, it is clear that the US government has spent a significant amount of time and money\nseeking to make it a reality. US Army officials have already stated that they intent to change\nFCS’s name, because they believe the name is inappropriate, stating ‘the future is now’ (FCS\nWatch 2008; Future Combat Systems 2008; Baard 2007; Klein 2007; Gannon 2001).\n\nSome of the complex logistical problems inherent in such an undertaking include: finance\nallocation, giving the approval for use to commanders, inter-agency cooperation, a common\nvernacular, rules of engagement, and adhering to the program’s stated goals. The US is\ncontinually modernizing its cyber force, creating new hacker units, conducting cyber war\nexercises, and diversifying and limiting the number of access points that could be used for an\nattack (Waterman 2008; Greenberg 2007). And the US is not alone, ‘more than 120 countries\nalready have or are developing such computer attack capabilities’ (GOA 1996). Information\nwarfare is being adopted by all modern nations and competition is mounting.\n\n**Informationization**\n\nChina’s 2006 white paper on national defence places an emphasis on the informationization\nof the military. “Informationization” (xinxihua) means improving the PLA’s ability to use\nthe latest technologies in command, intelligence, training, and weapon systems. New\nautomatic command systems linked by fibre-optic internet, satellite and new high-frequency\ndigital radio systems, allow for more efficient joint-service planning and command, while\nalso enabling a reduction in layers of command. The PLA’s move towards information\ntechnology can be seen with the use of new space-based surveillance and intelligence\ngathering systems, ASATs, anti-radar, infrared decoys, and false target generators. PLA\nsoldiers are using decision simulators, a low-light automatic tracking system for helicopters,\nand a battlefield artillery/mortar fuse jamming system derived from Russian technology.\nOSINT on China’s military continually makes note of informationization and the related, if\nnot identical, fields of cyber warfare, information warfare, CNO, and EW. “Priority is given\nto R&D of new and high-tech weaponry and equipment, and endeavours to achieve\nbreakthroughs in a number of key technologies and leapfrogging technological progress, thus\nspeeding up weaponry and equipment modernization” (China's National Defense 2006).\n\n42\n\n\n-----\n\nInformationization includes increased education of soldiers in cyber warfare and NCW, a\nreorganization of military branches and command system, and integrating joint operations.\nThe PLA is improving the information network for military training, and has built more\nvirtual laboratories, digital libraries and digital campuses to provide distance learning and\nonline teaching and training. University courses have emerged for cyber attack and defence,\na study of hacker methods, computer virus design and application, and network security\nprotocols (Annual Report to Congress 2008). Following the Russian example, China is\nengaging in the debate of defining cyber warfare, in part through the Shanghai Cooperation\nOrganization, in order to have a hand in the shaping of a legal framework and rules of\nengagement related to this new warfare. The PLA is pursuing a comprehensive\ntransformation from a mass army designed for protracted wars of attrition on its territory to\none capable of fighting and winning short duration, high intensity conflicts along its\nperiphery against high-tech adversaries (Annual Report to Congress 2008) – an approach that\nChina refers to as preparing for “local wars under conditions of informationization” (China's\nNational Defense 2006).\n\n**Exponential Growth and Unrestricted Warfare**\n\nOne view on twentieth century patterns of unrestricted warfare has noted:\n\nThe names Watt and Edison are nearly synonymous with great technical inventions, and\nusing these great technological masters to name their age may be said to be reasonable.\nHowever, from then on, the situation changed, and the countless and varied technological\ndiscoveries of the past 100 years or so makes it difficult for the appearance of any new\ntechnology to take on any self importance in the realm of human life. While it may be said that\nthe formulations of \"the age of the steam engine\" and \"the age of electrification\" can be said\nto be names which reflect the realities of the time, today, with all kinds of new technology\ncontinuously beating against the banks of the age so that people scarcely have the time to\naccord them brief acclaim while being overwhelmed by an even higher and newer wave of\ntechnology, the age in which an era could be named for a single new technology or a single\ninventor has become a thing of the past. This is the reason why, if one calls the current era\nthe \"nuclear age\" or the \"information age,\" it will still give people the impression that you are\nusing one aspect to typify the whole situation. (Qiao Liang & Wang Xiangsui 1999).\n\nIt is important to stop for a moment and ponder the rapid advancement in military weaponry.\nNew weaponry and concepts are easily dismissed as science fiction, yet the integration of\nmobile phones and the internet in 2008 would resemble science fiction to someone in the\n1980s. Reports of research and development may be noted momentarily before being\nsubsumed in a busy, informationally-competitive world. For the purpose of this study, it is\nuseful to acknowledge them in passing as they show the rapid advancement in science and\ntechnology, where military weapons are headed, and the increasing complexity and\ncooperation involved in their development and use. Current militarily-applicable science and\ntechnology, under development or already in use, include: augmented reality (Bonsor 2008);\nbiotechnology; genetics; giving soldiers internal/biologic infrared, night vision, radar, and\nsonar capability (Block 2006); GPS; force fields (Hershkovitch 1998); invisibility cloaks\n(Mark 2008; Winkler 2003); microwave guns (Beam It Right There Scotty 2005);\nnanotechnology; neuroscience; positron bombs (Davidson 2004); robotic exoskeletons\n(Berkeley Bionics Human Exoskeleton 2007; Yeates 2007); space-based weapons such as\nANGELS (Lewis 2005) and Rods from God (Adams 2004); telepathy (Braukus 2004; Put\nYour Mobile Where Your Mouth Is 2002); thought control of internet surfing and electronic\n\n43\n\n\n-----\n\ndevices (New Technology Operated by Thought 2007); unmanned ground combat vehicles\n(Bloom 2008); and unmanned combat aerial vehicles (Pike 2008).\n\nAdding further to this complexity, Unrestricted Warfare, a book by two PLA senior colonels,\nQiao Liang and Wang Xiangsui, claims that warfare is no longer strictly a military operation,\nand that the battlefield no longer has boundaries. Unrestricted Warfare was published by the\nPLA Literature and Arts Publishing House in Beijing in February 1999. According to the\nFBIS translation editor, the book ‘was endorsed by at least some elements of the PLA\nleadership’ and an interview with one of the authors was published in the CPC Youth\nLeague’s official daily newspaper on June 28, 1999. Thus while the book is not entirely\nbacked by the PLA, especially the older generation, like the ‘half empty, half full’ glass\nanalogy, it does have some official backing and hence a degree of legitimacy as a document\nassisting analysis as to where the PLA is headed and how asymmetric tactics against a\nsuperior hi-tech military might be employed.\n\nEnvironmental concerns, human rights in regard to weapons of mass destruction, and the\nincreasingly intertwined economies and political structures of globalization all have an\nimpact on modern warfare. Sheer might of weaponry can no longer guarantee victory under\nthese conditions. US extravagance in weaponry has been shown to stymie in the face of\nguerrilla warfare in Vietnam and Iraq. Under limited warfare, asymmetric warfare has seen a\nresurgence in use and value. Terrorist groups such as Al Qaeda employ guerrilla tactics and\nmake use of the internet and financial institutions to subvert traditional warfare (Levinson\n2008; Yassin 2008). No single weapon can deliver a decisive victory, and weapons have\nbeen replaced by weapons systems. For example, the patriot missile relies on multiple\ntechnologies working in concert, from satellites to the missile itself, with data being relayed\naround the world. Modern militaries have become reliant on electronic sophistication. The\nauthors of Unrestricted Warfare assert that war has not disappeared, but its appearance has\nchanged and its complexity has increased (Qiao and Wang 1999).\n\n**Non-Traditional Threats**\n\nIncreasing interdependence among states has increased the danger of non-traditional security\nthreats, including the spread of disease, environmental damage, international terrorist groups,\ninternational crime, acquisition and transportation of energy and resources, natural disasters,\nand intertwined economies that can have an impact on social and political issues. For\nexample, modern transportation has made it possible for criminals to traverse the globe with\nrelative ease. The internet allows them to transfer or hide money across the globe and to\ncovertly communicate beyond the jurisdiction of their enemies. Natural disasters or\ncommunicable diseases are no longer something which can be kept quiet as information\nradiates out through global media, causing damage to soft power factors, tourism, business,\nand international scrutiny (China's National Defense in 2006).\n\nThe line between military and non-military, soldier and civilian, is being blurred. Terrorism\nis the most common example: the 2001 plane hijackings in the US, the Madrid train\nbombings in 2004, and the London bombings in 2005 to name just a few key examples.\nThese lack an easily identifiable enemy to target, they cross territorial boundaries and use\nasymmetric attacks. Further blurring the line are the Sarin gas attacks on the Tokyo subway\nby disciples of the Aum Shinri Kyo, the actions of currency speculators in relation to the East\nAsian financial crisis, drug cartels, the mafia, media moguls who can influence the opinion of\na mass audience, or industrial polluters who affect the economy and health of their\n\n44\n\n\n-----\n\nneighbours. These events can cause damage and disruption equal to war, but there is no\nforeign military or state against which to go to war. The individuals involved may be from\nmultiple states and acting without government sponsorship.\n\nAnother form of non-traditional threat comes from hackers. Hackers tend not to have\nmilitary training, they may or may not have a political agenda, and they are capable of\ncausing massive damage with nothing more than an off-the-shelf computer and an internet\nconnection. For example, two British teenagers were able to access files on ballistic weapons\nresearch of the US. They then took control of US air force computers and proceeded to\nintrude into other military and government installations, making it appear as though the US\nmilitary was hacking other states (Hacking U.S. Government Computers from Overseas\n2001). The rapid advancements in technology and globalization are opening new and\ncomplex ways to subvert security. In 2008, a group of 11 people managed to steal 45 million\nusers’ bank and credit card details, resulting in a loss of more than $256 million. The group\nmembers were from diverse, yet cyber-advanced, geographical locations, including: Belarus,\nEstonia, China, Ukraine, and the US. Their unprecedented feat was accomplished by sitting\noutside of TJX retail stores and hacking into the store’s wireless network. This illustrates\nasymmetry, emerging technology security risks, globalization, and the enhanced vulnerability\nof commercial targets as opposed to direct military targets (Malone 2008; Almeida 2006).\n\n**Combination**\n\nTo be militarily successful in this new era will require the ability to combine operations.\nCombining weapons has been used throughout military history. Horses, armour, stirrups, and\nswords are not as effective when used individually. Their combination can create synergy,\nwhere the combined strength is greater than the individual parts. During the Gulf War, the\nUS combined the old A-10 ground attack aircraft with the new Apache helicopter to create a\n“lethal union” (Qiao and Wang 1999). By dropping leaflets and publicizing video of\nprecision strike weaponry, the US combined PSYOPS and media warfare as well. The US\nhas pursued additional combinations of traditional and non-traditional attack methods.\nDuring the 1979 Iran Hostage Crisis, the US initially tried traditional military force, but when\nthis attempt failed they froze Iran’s foreign assets, imposed an arms embargo, supported Iraq\nwith weaponry and training, and began diplomatic negotiations. When all these channels\nwere used together, the crisis finally came to an end. The Americans have also employed\nnon-traditional attacks against non-traditional enemies. For example, they used hacking\nmethods to search for and cut off the bank accounts of Osama Bin Laden in various states\n(Musharbash 2008; Vallence 2008).\n\nChina has demonstrated its commitment to such combinations. It seeks to develop military\nmodernization and economic growth in tandem, with an emphasis on science and technology.\nChina’s 2006 defence white paper puts forth a goal to “work for close coordination between\nmilitary struggle and political, economic, diplomatic, cultural and legal endeavours”, using\n“strategies and tactics in a comprehensive way. . .” Also noted is the importance of taking\npart in international organizations, such as ASEAN+Three, the Shanghai Cooperation\nOrganization, WTO, IMF, and the International Olympic Committee. These open up\ndiplomacy, aid in soft power, and give China a voice in determining the legal framework of a\nglobalized world (Ikenberry 2008; China's National Defense in 2006).\n\nTo learn how to conduct cyber security, the Chinese must have a full understanding of how\nattacks are conducted; therefore they will learn offence along with the defence - the two are\n\n45\n\n\n-----\n\ninseparable. China has repeatedly stated its goal of military modernization, and cyber\nwarfare is where modern militaries are headed. However, cyber warfare would unlikely be\nused alone. It could be used simultaneously with a traditional attack, perhaps as a first blow\nto take an opponent off guard, or in tandem with multiple non-traditional attacks, such as\nPSYOPS and economic operations, or variants of each. Additional combined tactics that will\nbe discussed in the following sections include cyber attack, cyber reconnaissance, and market\ndominance.\n\n**Internal Security**\n\nAs seen with the lack of division between the PLA and PAP, the Chinese defence white\npaper’s stated goal of developing the military and economy in tandem, and with the blurring\nof lines in Unrestricted Warfare, China cannot ignore the full spectrum of impact that\nInformation Communication Technologies (ICT) will have, including that within its borders.\nChina’s internet population has risen to 210 million people (Anick 2008; Bridis 2008). And,\nas of 2007, China possessed over 500 million mobile phones. China has become a world\nleader in the communications industry, and 3G and 4G technology are increasing the ability\nfor mobile phones to supplant a personal computer for online activities. On the one hand ICT\nsupports economic, scientific, and technology development; on the other it creates a nontraditional security threat.\n\nSocial networking services can be used as a tool to further nationalistic goals. These goals\nmay include the spread of political ideology, propaganda, and disinformation. As seen with\nthe US Information Operations Roadmap, PSYOPS are an integral component of cyber\nwarfare. Operatives can sway audiences by presenting well thought out arguments or by\naltering opposing views; they may also manipulate democratized news by artificially inflating\nvotes using scripts (Cuban 2008). Recent informationization military courses offered at\nWuhan University include “An introduction to US and Taiwanese social information\nsystems” suggesting that China has already recognized the benefits of utilizing social\nnetworking externally (China’s Proliferation Practices, and the Development of Its Cyber and\nSpace Warfare Capabilities 2008).\n\nAdditionally, online users are increasingly volunteering to enter large amounts of personal\ndata, which can, and has been, used for prosecutions (Use of Social Network Websites in\nInvestigations 2008; WFTV 2008; Layer 8 2007). Users do so to enjoy the social service it\nprovides, either not realizing, or unconcerned, that the government is simultaneously gaining\naccess to a self-imposed Big Brother. Not only can China use this information to its benefit,\nbut also it must secure it from being used by an adversary, such as its use for identifying\npotential espionage and subversive assets. In terms of stemming anti-government agendas,\nstate agencies censor blogs, bulletin boards, email, and forums. Internet Service Providers\n(ISPs) often take it upon themselves to censor users, because they are held legally responsible\nfor any customer who violates the law. Internet cafés are required to keep detailed records of\ntheir customers. In addition, “every Chinese person who signs up for internet service must\nregister with his or her local police department within 30 days” (China and Internet\nCensorship 2006).\n\nAs China’s economy continues to grow, personal electronic devices are becoming more\naccessible to Chinese citizens. Products such as personal computers, high speed internet\nconnections, mp3 players, large hard drives for storage, gaming systems, and advanced\nmobile phones fuel a desire for more software and entertainment. This will enhance\n\n46\n\n\n-----\n\ninternational criticism of Chinese copyright infringements _and it will make it difficult for_\nChina to prevent the spread of Western culture (French 2006; People’s Daily Online 2006;\nPirates of the Orient 2006). Increased connectivity also increases the capability of people to\nconduct subversive activities that endanger state security. This may include, “Signing online\npetitions, calling for reform and an end to corruption, planning to set up a pro-democracy\nparty, publishing rumours about SARS, communicating with groups abroad, opposing the\npersecution of the Falun Gong and calling for a review of the 1989 crackdown on the\ndemocracy protests . . .” (Kumar 2006). Other emerging non-traditional threats include mob\nmentality, consumer price manipulation, domestic hacker groups who can damage and\ninterfere with the Chinese government or drag it into conflict with other states, and the\nsecurity of the identity and financial details of a growing online consumer market (Delio\n2001).\n\nIn addition to China’s economy being directly linked to military issues, so too are domestic\nthreats, soft power, and the control of information. Readily available free web sources, such\nas blogs, photo uploading, video uploading, Podcasts, torrents, and RSS feeds, have given\npowers to individuals that were once restricted to large media outlets. Social networking\nsites allow for the spread of this information across the globe at speeds exceeding traditional\nmass media, and they are capable of reaching larger markets. These social networking\nservices, often referred to as Web 2.0, are noted for their ability for people to collaborate and\nshare information online, particularly emphasizing real-time dynamic displays,\ninterconnectedness, and being a part of a larger community. China maintains strict\ngovernment control over television, newspapers, and radio; therefore these new forms of\ndistribution pose a threat to China’s control. Censorship of the internet by China, known as\nthe Great Firewall, can be seen in the banning of foreign sites, such as Blogger and Voice of\nAmerica, as well as a wide range of search terms and images the government deems a threat\nto national security or counter-productive to the political party. During the 2007 uprising in\nTibet, China blocked access to the video website YouTube (Richards 2008), and on multiple\noccasions it has been accused of using Photoshop to digitally alter photos in its favour\n(Pasternack 2008; Yue 2008). With the increasing popularity and economic success of Web\n2.0, coupled with China’s global presence (prestige and international scrutiny) it is unlikely\nthat the Chinese government will ban these new forms of news distribution on a permanent\nbasis. However, it will seek to understand and entrench itself within the emerging system.\n\nChina has struggled to cope with internal and external cyber dissidents. This includes prodemocracy movements and the dissemination of sensitive information such as the spread of\nSARS and human rights abuses. Pro-democracy activists Li Yibing and Jiang Lijun of Hong\nKong used virtual dead drops to secretly pass messages, such as a plot to “disrupt the 16th\nCommunist Party Congress by phoning the police with a false bomb alert” (Reporters\nWithout Borders 2006). Each member knew the user name and password to a single email\naccount. They would save messages as drafts, allowing the other member to log in and read\nit at a later point. This avoided detection, because no message was ever sent. This represents\nan asymmetric advantage provided by new technology; however China demonstrated its\nprowess in using the same technology to combat the cyber-dissidents by using international\ncooperation, internet laws, and online eavesdropping. Activists can use the internet to build\ncoalitions, create e-petitions, and organize protests, using elements such as maps, lookouts,\nand live broadcasts. Foreign bloggers using commercially available satellite imagery have\ncompromised Chinese military secrets on numerous occasions. These non-governmental\nbloggers have uncovered a Chinese site used for developing submarine technology, a training\nfacility used to prepare for a potential conflict with India, and the construction of a fourth\n\n47\n\n\n-----\n\nsatellite and missile launch facility in Hainan (Reporters Without Borders 2006; Yahoo\nimplicated in third cyberdissident trial 2006).\n\nDetermined Chinese internet users are finding ways around The Great Firewall. One popular\nway is to use proxy relays. A proxy server acts as an intermediate; it allows them to access\nbanned sites through servers that are based abroad. Other techniques include using\nspecifically designed software, circumventors, tunnelling, encryption, and cached pages.\nSeveral foreign organizations have voluntarily taken on the task of circumventing China’s\ncensorship and making this information public. Among the groups that may have breached\nThe Great Firewall are the University of Cambridge, the University of Toronto, M.I.T.,\nunderground hackers (presumably doing it just for the challenge), and groups formed by\nChinese defectors. Software such as Dynapass, Ultrasurf, Freegate and Garden Networks are\nused by approximately 100,000 people in China to gain access to news and information that\nis blocked by the firewall. With the increasing interconnectivity of modern times, China\nmust actively defend against these internal threats or risk having collateral damage to the\nmilitary, soft power, economy, and political integrity (China Tightens Vice on Internet 2006).\n\nDespite some drawbacks, it is in China’s best interest to promote the growth of the internet as\nit will boost the economy, improve education, and keep the nation competitive in the 21[st]\ncentury. New freedoms for expressing political opinion will be counterbalanced by new\nmeans of censorship and means to reduce a widening digital and social divide. The Chinese\ngovernment must be moderate in its approach to censorship and the digital divide or it runs\nthe risk of widespread dissent resulting from increasing socio-economic/rural-urban\ndisparities. The impact of the internet on China’s near future will be one of expanded\ngrowth, a complex interaction of balances, and a constant adaptation to evolving technologies\nfrom within pre-established ideologies. The following sections will further demonstrate how\nthe average internet user is becoming intertwined with military activity.\n\n**3.** **Cyber Reconnaissance and Attack**\n\nNCW, IO, FCS, and Informationization are not identical to cyber attack and cyber\nreconnaissance; however they significantly overlap. The first four, discussed above, tend to\ndeal with the hi-tech advancement of traditional military assets, PSYOPS, and media warfare\n– all of which rely on the internet in some form. The lexicon is continuing to develop, having\nat times included the terms: total dimensional warfare, expeditionary forces, command and\ncontrol warfare, information warfare, full spectrum dominance, and electronic warfare.\nCyber attack may be thought of as hacking with the intent to destroy or disrupt. This could\ninclude the physical destruction of a computer, deleting/re-writing of files, or knocking a\nnetwork or service offline. Cyber reconnaissance is the collection of data, also known as\ncyber espionage or network intrusion. This may include technology transfer or intelligence,\nsuch as troop locations or weaknesses that could be used in an attack. In many cases a hacker\ngoes from reconnaissance to attack at will. Here all six will be addressed – NCW, IO, FCS,\nInformationization, Cyber Attack, and Cyber Reconnaissance - as components of cyber\nwarfare (China’s Proliferation Practices, and the Development of Its Cyber and Space\nWarfare Capabilities 2008).\n\nThis section will examine cyber reconnaissance with an emphasis on Chinese examples and\nmilitary applications. In addition to China’s stated goal of informationization and the quasiofficially endorsed book, Unrestricted Warfare, this section will show that foreign allegations\n\n48\n\n\n-----\n\nand widespread network intrusions suggest China is developing a cyber warfare capability.\nCyber warfare fits with China’s established patterns of asymmetry and technology transfer.\nIn order to grasp why Beijing would pursue cyber warfare as a means of leapfrogging, it is\nessential to acknowledge the skills of hacking. Hackers utilize a wide range of tools with\nhighly sophisticated techniques, the scope of which is beyond this article; however some\nbasic understanding is necessary. Hacking is capable of causing massive damage with little\nfunding, it is difficult to detect and defend against, it provides a high level of deniability, and\nit eliminates the problem of geographical distance.\n\n**Security Hacking**\n\nA common method used in cyber reconnaissance and attack is the security exploit. A\nsecurity exploit is a prepared application that takes advantage of a known weakness. It is a\npiece of software, data, or commands that utilize a bug, glitch, or vulnerability to cause an\nunintended or unanticipated behaviour to occur on computer software, hardware, or\nelectronic devices. This can allow the attacker to take control of the computer, permitting its\nuse for other tactics, such as DDoS discussed below. An exploit may be used to gain lowlevel entrance to a computer, after which a hacker can search for further exploits to attain\nhigh-level access such as system administrator (root). This tactic is known as privilege\nescalation. Once exploit vulnerability has been identified by security experts, a patch will be\nissued. For this reason hackers try to keep known exploits secret. These are known as zero\nday exploits, and hackers may catalogue large numbers of them for their own use or to be\nsold on the black market (Hines 2008). In 2006, Taiwan was hit with “13 PLA zero-day\nattacks”, for which it took Microsoft 178 days to develop patches (Tkacik 2007).\n\nVulnerability scanners may be used to identify exploits. One such scanner known as a port\nscanner automates the process of finding weaknesses of computers on a network. These\ncheck to see which ports on a specified computer are ‘open’, available to access, and\nsometimes will detect what program or service is listening on that port. Turning from\nreconnaissance to attack, once an open port is found, large quantities of data can be sent in an\nattempt to cause a buffer overflow. This can cause exposure of data, memory loss, and/or a\ncrash within the compromised system.\n\nThe primary means to identify computers used in cyber warfare is the IP address. An IP\naddress is a numerical identification that network management assigns to devices\nparticipating in a computer network utilizing the Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) for\ncommunication between nodes. In essence, each computer has its own unique IP address.\nThe Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) is responsible for\nglobal IP address allocation. ICANN, a non-profit organisation operating in the US, is under\ncontract with US Department of Commerce and previously with US Department of Defense.\nDespite this identification tool, hackers can mask their identity by using proxy servers.\nInformation is routed through multiple computers, only showing each computer’s identity to\nthe next in line. For example, a Chinese hacker could route his or her activity through a\ncomputer in Brazil, which routes its activity through Russia. The computer in Russia could\nbe used to attack a computer in the US, and the US would see it as an attack from Russia.\nPerhaps through painstaking effort the American investigators can identify that the Russian\ncomputer was a proxy, but then they are led to Brazil. If they manage to go from Brazil to\nChina, they are still unsure whether China was the originator or simply another link in the\nchain. Proxy servers can be rented or obtained through compromised systems. Additionally,\n\n49\n\n\n-----\n\nfree software such as Tor (The Onion Router), encryption, tunnelling protocol, and wireless\naccess points (hotspots) add additional anonymity.\n\nA spoofing attack is when a person or program fools another into thinking it is someone or\nsomething else. One example is the man-in-the-middle attack, in which person C gets person\nA to believe they are person B, and they get person B to believe they are person A, thus\ngaining access to information sent in both directions. This is accomplished by monitoring\npackets sent from A to B (often involving a packet sniffer), guessing their sequence and\nnumber, knocking them out with a SYN attack, and injecting packets from C. Firewalls may\ndefend against these attacks, if they have been configured to only accept IP addresses from\nthe intended correspondent.\n\nWebpage spoofing, known as phishing, imitates a webpage such as a bank’s website. When\nthe user enters their data, such as passwords and usernames, the fake website catalogues their\ninformation. Webpage spoofing is often used in conjunction with URL spoofing, using an\nexploit to display a false URL, and DNS cache poisoning to direct the user away from their\nintended site and then back again when the data has been collected. As a precaution some\nwebsites require a user to arrive at their login page from a specified referrer page, but these\nreferrer pages may also be spoofed. During the 2008 Olympics net users in China received a\nhigh volume of email spam offering video highlights of the games. Clicking on the links\nbrought users to spoofed CNN pages which asked them to download a codec to watch the\nvideos; once installed the computer was compromised and become a part of the Rustock\nbotnet, i.e. an automated ‘robot’ running on the web to generate false headlines that entice\npeople to load harmful code (Miller 2008; Hi-tech Thieves Target Olympics 2008).\n\nSpoofing may also be used defensively. For example, the Recording Industry Association of\nAmerica (RIAA) has practised spoofing on peer to peer networks. The RIAA floods these\ncommunities with fake files of sought-after material. This deters down loaders by means of\nfear and by wasting their time and bandwidth. This could be employed in the same manner\nby militaries, or as a source of disinformation. A similar defensive tactic, known as a honey\npot, lures criminals in by offering sought-after data or what appears to be a compromised\nnetwork. The honey pot is designed to collect data on the intruder, while giving away\nnothing, or giving away something that is perceived as an acceptable loss to gain something\ngreater in return.\n\nAttackers may also compromise a computer or network by using a Trojan horse, often known\nsimply as a Trojan. A Trojan appears to perform a desirable function, while secretly\nperforming malicious functions. Trojans can be used to gain remote access, destroy data,\ndownload data, serve as a proxy, falsify records, or shut down the target computer at will.\nThe Pentagon, defence-related think tanks, and defence-related contractors were the target of\na combined spoofing and Trojan attack in 2008. Trojans were hidden in email attachments\ndesigned to look as if they were sent from a reliable source. The Trojan was designed to bury\nitself into the system, covertly gather data, and send it to an internet address in China. Due to\nthe ability of hackers to route their activity through foreign computers, security experts were\nunable to determine if China was the final destination, if it was an attempt at framing China,\nor if it was a state-sponsored activity (Waterman 2008).\n\nThis was not the first time US research facilities received spoofed emails with Trojans\npurportedly from China. In 2005 the Oak Ridge National Laboratory and Los Alamos\nNational Laboratory became infected. No classified information was believed to have been\n\n50\n\n\n-----\n\nobtained; however personal information of visitors from the years 1990 to 2004 was\ncompromised. This included names, date of birth, and social security numbers. These two\nresearch facilities were originally constructed for sensitive nuclear weapons research during\nWWII. Today they are used ‘for research in numerous areas including national security,\nnanotechnology, advanced materials, and energy’ (Lasker 2005). In general, Cyber\nreconnaissance may be an attempt to attain victory conditions before battle. These intrusions,\nif undetected, allow intruders to identify vulnerabilities for future cyber attack. The cost of\nprobing computer networks is low, given the lack of attribution, requiring as few as one\nhacker, and the ability to work from remote locations using off-the-shelf hardware.\n\nA rootkit is a toolkit hidden on a compromised computer. The rootkit can be a diverse set of\nprograms, but invariably is designed to hide the fact that the computer has been compromised\nand defending itself once detected. These rootkits often hide themselves as seemingly\ninnocuous drivers or kernel modules, depending on the details of the operating system and its\nmechanisms. In addition to covering the tracks of an intruder, they can allow easier access in\nthe future by opening backdoors. They may also include an arsenal of sniffers, key loggers,\nand tools that relay email chat conversations. Rootkits may also serve as a staging ground for\nemail spam distribution and DDoS attacks as a part of a larger botnet. In 2005, it was\nrevealed that Sony BMG included rootkit software on their CDs. This software altered the\nWindows OS to allow access to the computer by anyone aware of the rootkits existence,\npresumably to enforce copyright protection. This example shows that corporations, too, can\nbe a part of cyber attack or reconnaissance, furthering China’s desire to create its own\nsoftware and establish market dominance as opposed to being subjected to the US’s.\nNumerous source codes for ready-made rootkits can be found on the internet. In 2006,\nalleged Chinese hackers infiltrated “the Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and\nSecurity, which manages export licensing of military-use products and information” using\nrootkits to allow privilege escalation. The agency spent millions of dollars on new, clean,\nhardware and software, because they could not restore the integrity of the compromised\nnetwork (Tkacik 2007).\n\nA virus is a self-replicating program that spreads by inserting copies of itself into other\nexecutable code or documents. The original virus may modify the copies, known as a\nmetamorphic virus, making its destruction more difficult (similar to genetic diversity). A\nvirus can spread from one computer to another through the internet, email, the network file\nsystem, or removable medium such as a USB drive. Damage caused by viruses include\ndeleting files, damaging programs, reformatting the hard drive, and disrupting or debilitating\nthe system completely. Viruses may also be used as PSYOPs or demoralizers by presenting\ntext, video, or audio messages to the computer user. In order to replicate, a virus must be\nallowed to execute code and write to memory. For this reason, many viruses attach\nthemselves to executable files, such as Word and pdf documents, or html links. Some viruses\ntry to avoid detection by killing the tasks associated with antivirus software before it can\ndetect them. The Panda Burning Incense Virus is an example of cyber warfare posing an\ninternal security threat to China, and it set a legal precedent for pursuing and prosecuting\nhackers (Lemon 2007).\n\nLike a virus, a worm is also a self-replicating program. A worm is a program or suite of\nprograms that attempts to scan a network for vulnerable systems and automatically exploit\nthose vulnerabilities. Some worms work passively, sniffing for usernames and passwords and\nusing those to compromise accounts, installing copies of themselves into each such account,\nand typically relaying the compromised account information back to the intruder through a\n\n51\n\n\n-----\n\ncovert channel. Many worms have been designed only to spread, and do not attempt to alter\nthe systems through which they pass. However, the Morris worm and Mydoom showed that\nnetwork traffic and other unintended effects can cause major disruption. A ‘payload’ is code\ndesigned to do more than spread the worm - it might delete files on a host system, encrypt\nfiles for extortion, send documents via email, or destroy the target computer by rendering it\nunusable.\n\nThe Code Red and Code Red II worms were the most successful worms in internet history,\ncausing nearly $2 billion in damages and infecting over 600,000 computers. The worms,\nwhich may have originated from a university in Guangdong, China (United States General\nAccounting Office 2001), attacked computers running Microsoft’s IIS web server and\nexploited a buffer overflow. Home computers were largely unaffected; however any attempt\nat infection caused them to crash. The worms created slow downs in internet speed, knocked\nwebsites and networks offline, and defaced websites with the phrase “Hacked by Chinese!” although Chinese involvement was never confirmed. The attacks may have been statesponsored, they may have been underground hackers and script kiddies, or they may have\nbeen a combination of the two. A script kiddie is not an expert in computer security. They\nuse pre-packaged automated tools written by others and found online, such as WinNuke\napplications, Back Orifice, NetBus, Sub7, Metasploit, and ProRat. Even though script\nkiddies lack sophistication, and they are looked down on by the hacker culture, they still pose\na significant security risk. When media attention is drawn to internet incidents, it is often\nfollowed by individuals seeking to participate without any coordinated effort or instructions\nto do so. Code Red II had a slightly different payload that could open a backdoor, leaving the\ncomputers vulnerable to further exploitation (Schwartz 2007; Cost of 'Code Red' Rising\n2001).\n\nThe Code Red worms coincided with the collision of a US reconnaissance plane and a\nChinese fighter jet, in which the Chinese pilot died, and known as the Hainan or EP-3\nIncident. Patriotic Chinese hackers defaced dozens of US military and computer industry\nwebsites. Patriotic US hackers responded with inflammatory web page defacements,\ncomment spamming, posting of photoshopped derogatory pictures, and probably were the\nsource of the Code Blue Worm (Delio 2001). Code Blue sought out systems infected by\nCode Red and reprogrammed them to launch attacks against targets based in mainland China.\nIn particular, it launched DDoS attacks against the Chinese security firm NS Focus. These\ntype of attacks could be used clandestinely against one’s own country to spur nationalism. Or\ncyber attacks could be used by a third party state, or organization, to create conflict between\nexternal states to further some masked goal. For example, Iran could benefit by creating\ntension between the US and China through an attack prior to a US proposed UN resolution, in\nwhich China has veto power (Onley and Wait 2006; Delio 2001).\n\nIn 2004, the Myfip worm probably originated from IP addresses in the Chinese municipality\nof Tianjin (Brenner 2005). This worm stole pdf files, with later variants targeting Microsoft\nWord documents, schematics, and circuit board layouts. Among the victims were Bank of\nAmerica, BJ’s Wholesale Club, and Lexis-Nexis. The worm not only stole intellectual\nproperty, such as product designs, but also took customer lists and databases. Identifying the\nnumber of companies affected poses difficulties as they do not wish to further damage their\nbusiness by coming forward. To do so can damage consumer confidence and require the\n\n52\n\n\n-----\n\nimplementation of costly security measures. Businesses may also be oblivious to the number\nof previous infections and potential data loss as they simply update their patches and move on\n(Brenner 2005).\n\nA denial-of-service (DoS) attack or distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack is an attempt\nto make a computer resource unavailable to its intended users. This is accomplished by\nflooding the target with data requests, so that it cannot respond to legitimate traffic, or so that\nit responds so slowly that it is rendered useless. DDoS attacks may be conducted by a\ncollective of individuals, often co-ordinating their efforts, or by a network of computers\nunder the control of a single attacker. Such networks are called botnets, with each computer\nin the botnet being known as a bot, or a zombie. These computers have been taken control of\nby malicious users without the knowledge of the owner, usually through a rootkit, Trojan, or\nvirus. Sobig and Mydoom are examples of worms which created zombies. A botnet's\noriginator, known as a bot herder, can control the group remotely, usually through a means\nsuch as IRC, and usually for nefarious purposes. Infected zombie computers are used to send\nemail spam, to host contraband data such as child pornography, or to engage in distributed\ndenial-of-service attacks as a form of extortion. The services of a bot herder can be rented on\nthe black market. One estimate suggested that Chinese hackers have 750,000 zombie\ncomputers in the US alone (Waterman 2007). A similar, but non-malicious, phenomenon\ninvolving the banding together of excess computer power can be seen in the Search for ExtraTerrestrial Intelligence (SETI@home), or Stanford University’s protein folding simulations\n(Folding@home).\n\nDoS and DDoS attacks can prevent an internet site or service from functioning temporarily or\nindefinitely. DOS attacks can also lead to problems in the network branches around the\nactual computer being attacked. For example, the bandwidth of a router between the internet\nand a local area network may be consumed by an attack, compromising not only the intended\ncomputer, but also the entire network. If the attack is conducted on a sufficiently large scale,\nentire geographical regions of internet connectivity can be compromised without the\nattacker's knowledge or intent by incorrectly configured or flimsy network infrastructure\nequipment. Scripts can be set up to automate the process, and subtle variations of these\nattacks, such as smurf attacks, fraggle attacks, teardrop attack, ping flood, SYN flood, IRC\nfloods, banana attack, Fork bomb, pulsing zombie, and nuke exemplify their sophistication.\nVarious DoS-causing exploits such as buffer overflow can confuse server-running software\nand fill the disk space or consume all available memory or CPU time. A permanent denialof-service (PDoS), also known loosely as phlashing, is an attack that damages a system so\nbadly that it requires replacement or reinstallation of hardware. Unlike the DDoS, a PDoS\nattack exploits security flaws in the remote management interfaces of the victim's hardware,\nbe it routers, printers, or other networking hardware. These flaws leave the door open for an\nattacker to remotely ‘update’ the hardware firmware to a modified, corrupt or defective\nfirmware image, therefore bricking the device and making it permanently unusable for its\noriginal purpose. The PDoS is a hardware-targeted attack which can be much faster and\nrequires fewer resources than using a botnet in a DDoS attack.\n\nIt is important to note the difference between a DDoS and DoS attack. If an attacker mounts\na smurf attack from a single host it would be classified as a DoS attack. In fact, any attack\ndirected against computer availability would be classified as a DoS attack. On the other\nhand, if an attacker uses a thousand zombie systems to simultaneously launch smurf attacks\nagainst a remote host, this would be classified as a DDoS attack. Several botnets have been\nfound and removed from the internet. Dutch police located and disbanded a 1.5 million node\n\n53\n\n\n-----\n\nbotnet, and the Norwegian ISP Telenor disbanded a 10,000 node botnet (Keizer 2005;\nLeyden 2004). Large, coordinated international efforts to shut down botnets have also been\ninitiated, such as Operation Spam Zombies, which included agencies from 25 different states\n(Operation Spam Zombies 2005). It has been estimated that up to one quarter of all personal\ncomputers connected to the internet may become part of a botnet. And an estimated 50% of\nall pirated Windows programs contain pre-installed Trojans. China is renowned for its use of\npirated Windows programs. This is a cause for concern for China as it bogs down internet\nand computer efficiency. It also could make Chinese computers susceptible to international\ncondemnation, if their computers are used via proxy. Further, it demonstrates to China the\nvalue of developing its own operating systems for domestic and world markets, either to\navoid such problems, or to create them for others (Weber 2007).\n\nThere are also hybrids. A worm can install a rootkit, and a rootkit might include copies of one\nor more worms, packet sniffers, or port scanners. A rootkit or virus may be used to conduct a\nDoS attack, and compromising the system may include some traditional social engineering\n(HUMINT). So all of these terms have somewhat overlapping usage and they are often\nmisused by mainstream media. The depth of security hacking goes far beyond the examples\ngiven here. These examples serve as an introduction to the level of sophistication with which\ncomputers can be compromised, illustrating the difficulty in providing defence. They also\ndemonstrate the high level of damage that can be caused by a small group of individuals who\nwork with little funding. This adds to the lack of attribution as it does not require the funding\nand support of a military, making state-sponsored hacking easy to deny. In combination with\nanonymity tools and the ability to hide intrusions, security hacking provides a high level of\nstealth and asymmetry.\n\n**Military Applications of Hacking**\n\nThe USA’s paramount position and its heavy reliance on computers have made it a prime\ntarget. For this reason it has some of the most extensive information on cyber attacks. The\nUnited States has had millions of computers infected at a cost in the billions of dollars.\nHackers may be lone teenagers searching for fun or curiosity or state-sponsored intelligence\ngathering and technology transfer, the determination of which is highly problematic.\nFrequently hit targets include the US Department of Defense, the Pentagon, NASA, Los\nAlamos Laboratories, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon, Harvard\nUniversity, California Institute of Technology, and a wide range of think tanks, defence\ncontractors, military installations, and high profile commercial corporations. The attacks\nhave come from across the globe and identifying and prosecting those responsible has proven\ndifficult (Greenberg 2007; Hacking U.S. Government Computers from Overseas 2001).\n\nThese hackers have been able to steal classified data, such as naval codes, information on\nmissile guidance systems, personnel performance reports, weapons development, and\ndescriptions of the movement of equipment and personnel. Jonathan (“c0mrade”) James\ndownloaded $1.7 million worth of software used to control the International Space Station’s\nlife support. Dutch teenagers stole information on the Patriot rocket launching system, and\nthe Navy’s Tomahawk cruise missile, and tried to sell it to Iraqi officials during the Gulf War\n– Iraq thought it was a hoax and declined (Miklaszewski 1999). Hackers have\ncommandeered US commercial, educational, and military computers and used them in attacks\nagainst other nations, including Taiwan. Hackers can cause an immense amount of damage\nto a state, stealing information, deleting and changing files, transferring capital, and\n\n54\n\n\n-----\n\ndestroying programs or entire networks (Hacking U.S. Government Computers from\nOverseas 2001; Christensen 1999; Qian and Wang 1999).\n\nIn 2001 and 2002 Gary (“Solo”) McKinnon probed US Army, Navy, Air Force, Department\nof Defence, and NASA computers causing $700,000 worth of damage, taking down a\nnetwork of 2,000 computers, accessing classified data, deleting and re-writing files. He\naccomplished this on his own from his home in London using commercially available\nsoftware and a dial up connection. McKinnon claims he was searching for proof that the US\nis hiding information about UFOs and an anti-gravity propulsion system. This illustrates the\nrelative ease with which intrusions can take place, the difficulty of determining whether or\nnot it is a state-sponsored action, and a lack of legal framework for timely response. With\nsuch attacks occurring so frequently to vital industries, the US, with the largest military\nbudget in the world, has inevitably developed a means to defend against them, which by\nassociation means they have also developed the means to conduct cyber reconnaissance and\ncyber attacks itself. China, too, is the subject of frequent attacks, albeit less publicized, and it\nwill want to remain competitive with US military capabilities (Boyd 2008; Bruno 2008).\n\n**Titan Rain**\n\nA coordinated series of attacks against US installations are strong indicators that China is\ndeveloping a cyber warfare capability. The attacks which ran from 2003 to 2006 were\ndesignated ‘Titan Rain’. They targeted US defence and aerospace installations, Sandia\nNational Laboratories, Lockheed Martin, Redstone Arsenal, the Department of Defense, and\nNASA, gathering sensitive military data. The United Kingdom also reported being attacked\nby the Titan Rain hackers. Much of the data stolen was not classified; however it was not\nmeant for public or foreign consumption, nor was it meant for unlicensed use. For example,\nthe US military’s classified data is typically not connected to the broader internet, but\nsensitive information such as logistics support for the armed forces is. This can provide\nvaluable insight into field tested experience, as well as expose possible weaknesses to an\nadversary (Brenner 2007; Espiner 2005).\n\nIn addition to the unauthorized gathering, the US is concerned that enough of this data could\nbe used to piece together a larger picture, one that would be considered classified. Among\nthe information gathered were “a stockpile of aerospace documents with hundreds of detailed\nschematics about propulsion systems, solar panelling and fuel tanks for the Mars\nReconnaissance Orbiter . . . specs for the aviation-mission-planning system for Army\nhelicopters, as well as Falconview 3.2, the flight-planning software used by the Army and Air\nForce” (Thornburgh 2005). Although the majority of data appears to have been benign, its\nmassive quantity may one day prove to include items that the US deems classified at a later\ndate. These attacks could be a staging ground, testing US defences, for future operations of a\nmore serious nature.\n\nTitan Rain demonstrated how China could use cyber warfare as an asymmetric tactic (Norton\nTaylor 2007). Apparently, a team of hackers, estimated to number between 6 to 30, would\ntake control of US defence computers, copy everything on the hard drive within 30 minutes,\nand send that data to zombie computers in South Korea, Hong Kong, or Taiwan, where it was\nsubsequently routed to computers in the Chinese province of Guangdong. The ability to\nroute the data makes it difficult to prove the attacker’s identity. While it is believed China\nwas responsible, there is no certainty that the data was not further routed to another location.\nAdditionally, those computers may have been under remote control by a separate\n\n55\n\n\n-----\n\ngovernment, or the hackers may not have been state-sponsored. The attacks themselves were\nnot particularly sophisticated, requiring only minimal training with commercially available\nproducts. The instructions on how to conduct such attacks are widely available on the\ninternet itself (Delio 2001). But attempts to identify the attackers would require the\nburdensome task of sending covert agents to physically identify the source.\n\nBy using the virtual world, hackers are able to traverse great distances without leaving their\nstation. On the night of November 1, 2004, Titan Rain members scanned, broke into, and\nretrieved data from defence installations in Arizona, Virginia, California, and Alabama (in\nthat order) all within a period of six hours. Once attackers gain control of US computers,\nthrough methods such as Trojans, they can not only shut down the system, they can also\nconduct attacks using those computers. This could be used to raise condemnation of the US,\nas it would appear the US is attacking other states (Graham 2005; Thornburgh 2005). While\nproof is non-existent, some US officials believe that the PLA was responsible (Norton-Taylor\n2007). Chinese military doctrine repeatedly discusses “the importance of penetrating an\nadversary's military logistics and personnel networks. Furthermore, the multiple intrusions\ninto what nuisance and criminal hackers would regard as boring, mundane networks-networks that do not offer the treasure trove of credit card numbers, bank accounts, and\nidentity data that criminal hackers typically seek-- suggest a military purpose” (Tkacik 2007).\n\n**Further Evidence of Build-up**\n\nAttacks under the code name Titan Rain have ceased. However, OSINT suggests that cyber\nattacks from China persist. From 2005 to 2007, the US State Department, Bureau of Industry\nand Security, DoD, National Nuclear Security Administration, Department of Homeland\nSecurity, Boeing, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, and defence-related think\ntanks had intrusions from Chinese ISPs (China’s Proliferation Practices and the Development\nof Its Cyber and Space Warfare Capabilities 2008; Leyden 2007, Tkacik 2007, Almeida\n2006). Sensitive but non-classified data continues to be harvested; items such as emails and\nthe ‘names and other personal information on more than 1,500 employees’ (Onley and Wait\n2006). Attacks from Chinese ISPs have forced entire networks to be taken offline or\nreplaced. In 2005 alone, ‘the Pentagon logged more than 79,000 attempted intrusions’ (Reid\n2007). Cyber reconnaissance and attacks from Chinese IP addresses had become so frequent\nand aggressive that US President George W. Bush raised the subject to Chinese President Hu\nJintao at the APEC summit in 2007.\n\nThe difficulty of attribution in cyber attacks, such as proxies, botnets, non-state-sponsored\nhackers, and a lack of legal framework to pursue them, means these attacks may not have\ncome from China; however the accusations alone are evidence that China will want to\ndevelop a cyber warfare capability. China now has the world’s largest internet population, so\nin terms of volume, China has the most targets to defend. Chinese officials have stated that\nthey are the victim of ‘massive and shocking losses of state and military secrets via the\nInternet’ (Leyden 2007). Foreign states wishing to use cyber warfare against the US may\nrecognise the focus being placed on China and use Chinese computers to conduct their own\nreconnaissance and attacks by using botnets or proxies based there. Further, denouncements\nby the US may indicate that retaliatory responses are in the works and that the US will use\nallegations of Chinese incursions to bolster support for increasing US cyber warfare\ncapability, thereby putting China further behind in military competitiveness. Damage to\nChina’s soft power, particular in relation to ICT, may affect China’s economy by making\ninvestors cautious and export controls/legal bureaucracy more stringent. PSYOPS campaigns\n\n56\n\n\n-----\n\nand media warfare, of the type outlined by the US Information Operations Roadmap\n(discussed above), may help China regain its lost credibility. These are elements of cyber\nwarfare, but viewed as less offensive than reconnaissance and direct cyber3 attack.\n\n**Non-US Foreign Allegations**\n\nThe US is not alone in accusing China of using cyber warfare. In 2007 and 2008, China was\npublicly accused of hacking into government facilities by officials in Australia, France,\nGermany, India, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, and the UK (Basu 2008; Goodin 2008;\nHa 2008; Leyden 2007; Marquand 2007). The number of countries under Chinese attack\ncould be far greater as some may not know that they are under attack, may not wish to reveal\ntheir weakness due to a loss of soft power and consumer confidence, or they do not wish to\nupset China as a valuable trading partner. Hans Elmar Remberg, Vice President of the\nGerman Office for the Protection of the Constitution (Germany’s domestic intelligence\nagency) stated that “across the world the PRC is intensively gathering political, military,\ncorporate-strategic and scientific information in order to bridge their technological gaps as\nquickly as possible” (Tkacik 2007).\n\nUnlike HUMINT, cyber warfare provides a lack of definitive attribution, makes distance\nnearly irrelevant, allows for the mass accumulation of data in a short span of time, and at a\nsmall cost in comparison to traditional espionage or military activities. Cyber attacks, such as\nan incident that shut down the UK House of Commons, may only be small scale test runs,\nprobing, or reconnaissance blunders, meaning that the true scope of cyber attack has yet to be\nseen (Norton-Taylor 2007). Cyber reconnaissance appears to be the most beneficial tool of\ncyber warfare. Beyond finding exploitation points in the military for future attack, the\ncommercial sector allows China the opportunity to skip generations of research and\ndevelopment efforts, levelling the playing field in science and technology, and by association\nboosting economic and military might. Chinese hackers have even gone after British\nparliamentiary files on human rights issues, showing a potential interest in relation to soft\npower, globalization, international condemnation, and the legal apparatus. As _Unrestricted_\n_Warfare has shown, there are no boundaries in relation to such military operations._\n\n**4.** **Case Studies: Estonia, Georgia and Chanology**\n\nThe 2007 cyber attacks against Estonia, Georgia and Project Chanology are examples of\nlarge-scale cyber attacks. The Estonian attacks were the first to show how cyber attack\nagainst a state provides a debilitating effect at a low cost, a lack of attribution, a lack of legal\nframework in defence, world-wide attention, and may point to a new arm of traditional\nattack. The Russo-Georgian war of August 2008 was even more sophisticated and intense\nthan the Estonian case, showing the maturation of the process. Project Chanology reveals\nhow the collective masses can use online tools to emerge as a powerful force without a\ncentral leadership. This can be harnessed by military power through the tactics described in\nIO (Information Operations, see above). And as a matter of internal security, Chanologystyle movements must be carefully observed as they pose a non-traditional threat. Estonia\nand Chanology are an emerging expression of warfare that is fuelled by new powers afforded\nby the internet, but spills over into the real world, not only through financial loss and media\ncoverage (soft power), but also in the form of volatile protests, disruption, mob mentality, and\nthe capability of drawing governments and militaries into unwanted actions.\n\n57\n\n\n-----\n\n**Estonia**\n\nIn 2007, the Estonian government relocated a Soviet-era war memorial and bronze statue in\nTallinn, stating that the memorial symbolised Soviet occupation. The Russian government\ncondemned the relocation, claiming it was a tribute to those who fought in World War II.\nThe relocation sparked protests which resulted in 150 injuries, one death, and a month-long\ncyber war campaign. Estonian websites including parliament, banks, ministries, schools, and\nnewspaper outlets were attacked with DDoS attacks and web page defacements. Some\nwebsites also redirected users to images of Soviet soldiers and quotations from Martin Luther\nKing about resisting evil. Hackers who hit the ruling Reform Party's website left a fake\nmessage that the Estonian prime minister and his government were asking for Russian\nforgiveness and promising to return the statue to its original site (The Cyber Raiders Hitting\nEstonia 2007).\n\nThese attacks garnered world-wide attention. The Russian government was directly accused\nby media outlets and the Estonian Prime Minister Andrus Ansip. Russia had the motive and\nthe means for such an attack. However, there was no direct evidence to suggest that the\nattacks were state-sponsored. There was evidence that some of the IP addresses used in the\nattacks belonged to Russian government officials, and instructions on how to carry out cyber\nwarfare did circulate on Russian websites. However, the source of DDoS attacks could have\nbeen masked by using proxies or botnets that are located across the globe. Neither NATO\nnor European Commission experts were able to find any proof of official Russian\ngovernment participation. Further, the Russian government denounced Estonia’s claims and\nrefused to participate in any type of investigation (Bright 2007; Estonia Fines Man for 'Cyber\nWar' 2008; Estonia Hit by Moscow Cyber War 2007).\n\n**Debilitating Effect at a Low Cost**\n\nThe effects of the cyber attacks were magnified as Estonia is one of the most internet-savvy\nstates in the European Union (The Cyber Raiders Hitting Estonia 2007). The Estonian\ngovernment has pursued a paperless society, or e-government, and web-based banking.\nSlowing down, or halting, banking services and newspaper outlets that rely on advertising\nrevenue strains the economy. This happens not only through a direct loss in revenue, but also\nwith a reduction in productivity, lost efficiency, diverting resources, escalating frustration,\nand lost consumer and investor confidence. Estonia also uses the internet to elect\nparliamentary officials, file their taxes and, via mobile phone, shop or pay for parking. In\nsome cases, website administrators simply blocked access from foreign states. While this\nwas effective in curbing the attacks, it completely cut off banking services to Estonians\noutside of the country, vital to Estonian business people abroad. Spam emails inundated\ngovernment officials’ inboxes, halting online communication from the Parliament’s email\nserver. Officials closed off large portions of their network to keep more vital areas online. A\ngovernment briefing site was given high priority while the president’s website was sacrificed.\nThe 10 largest swarms of data requests by the hackers absorbed 90 megabits per second for\nup to 10 hours each, straining Estonia’s networks. It was ‘equivalent to downloading the\nentire Windows XP operating system every six seconds for 10 hours’ (Landler and Markoff\n2007). The cyber attacks on Estonia came close to shutting down the country’s digital\ninfrastructure. While these may seem more of a disruption than a collapse, the effects radiate\nout into society (Bright 2007; Estonia Hit by Moscow Cyber War 2007).\n\n58\n\n\n-----\n\nThe month-long campaign caused companies to put resources into alternative infrastructure,\nsuch as going back to traditional mail, relying on telephones, fax, and libraries, and reenforcing alternative methods of payment. As well as the cost of material infrastructure,\nthese type of cyber attacks cause a loss in productivity. This includes paying more people to\nstaff bank tellers, increased traffic on the streets, and long lines at retail outlets. Newspaper\noutlets, telephone companies, and product distributors, have grown accustomed to using\nonline tools, and now rely heavily on them. While this might be a boon for some industries,\nthe whole restructuring process weakens the nation in the short term. The cyber attacks are\ncomparable to the damage caused to industry (beyond tangible infrastructure) by flooding or\nblizzards. It places a nation in a state of flux, and leaves it more vulnerable to a traditional\nattack.\n\nDDoS attacks offer an enemy country an effective low cost assault with high deniability. The\nmajority of attacks on Estonia were DDoS, clogging its servers, switches, and routers.\nAnalysis from Arbor Networks revealed thousands of bots were used against Estonia from\nlocations as diverse as the US, Vietnam, Peru, and China. The cost to a state wanting to\nestablish botnets is minimal, requiring only one person, an internet connection, and a basic\ncomputer. While the information for conducting such attacks can be found online, it is more\nlikely someone with expertise, such as non-government hacker groups, would be involved in\nsecuring the rental of a botnet. This still keeps the number at a minimum, and hackers can\nfind alternative ways to fund the rental of servers with high bandwidth, such as credit card\ntheft (Waterman 2007; The Cyber Raiders Hitting Estonia 2007).\n\n**Deniability**\n\nDetermining the source of DDoS attacks is a difficult task, as they can be conducted with\nproxies or botnets. Even if an IP address is obtained, there is no certainty that that was the\ntrue source of the attack and not one link in a chain of computers or simply a compromised\ncomputer being used unbeknownst to the owner. Message boards and chat rooms located on\nRussian websites served as a meeting place for attackers, a place to coordinate their time of\nattack, discuss targets, and recruit others. Because these individuals can be scattered across\nthe globe, it is difficult to assign a group identity to them. The web host may not be aware\nthat plans are being laid on their website, or they may not realise the scope of such plans.\nThese discussions can appear as a childish prank, overshadowing the serious repercussions of\nthe actions taking place, with no individual feeling responsible to put a stop to it.\n\nThe Estonia cyber attacks raised debate as to whether they were sponsored by the Russian\ngovernment. Some believed the attacks were too sophisticated to be the work of individuals\nor even organised crime. Others believed the attacks were endorsed and guided by the\nRussian government, but thought they were not directly involved – using online operatives\nand media warfare as mentioned in IO. Russia has been accused in the past of sponsoring\n‘web brigades’ - cyber attack teams - that conduct PSYOPS, disinformation, spamming, and\ncyber bullying, such as revealing an enemy’s personal details (Polyanskaya 2006). From the\nperspective of officials from the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team and the\nPentagon’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the attacks were not conducted by\nsophisticated means, nor were they state-sponsored. The attackers used commercially\navailable off-the-shelf computers and scripts that are readily available on the internet\n(Waterman 2007). Data from the Arbor Networks Active Threat Level Analysis System\n(ATLAS) indicated that the attacks were conducted by multiple distributed botnets which\nappeared to have been acting independently (Kerner 2007). Even if the attacks were traced to\n\n59\n\n\n-----\n\nRussian government computers there was no certainty that those computers had not been\ntaken over by remote hackers. It would also seem foolish for the Russian government to use\nits own computers for such an attack, especially when it has the expertise to mask its identity,\nunless doing so was masking its identity (knowing that you know I know). Johannes Ullrich,\nchief research officer of the Bethesda, stated: “Attributing a distributed denial-of-service\nattack like this to a government is hard. It may as well be a group of bot herders showing\npatriotism, kind of like what we had with Web defacements during the US-China spy-plane\ncrisis [in 2001]” (Brenner 2007).\n\nAs evidence of the Estonia case continued to be examined, the consensus was that the\nRussian government was not directly involved. It appeared to have been “hacktavists” or\nsimply a mass number of individuals upset over the relocation of the statue. Plans for the\nattacks were posted on internet forums, message boards, and chat groups prior to the attacks,\nincluding detailed instructions on how to send disruptive messages and which Estonian\nwebsites to use as targets. The discussion of proposed attacks had become so popular that it\nwas indexed by Google, causing a Google search for the topic to return these incendiary\nwebsites at the top of its search results, bringing them to the attention of even more people.\nDespite being aware of these discussions prior to the attacks, Estonia could do little to stop\nthem. Estonian officials could not identify the individuals discussing attacks, as online (not\nreal) names were used, and obtaining IP addresses would involve going after the website\nadministrator and foreign ISP – a task with which mega-corporations such as the MPAA and\nRIAA have difficulty, despite their massive funding and even when going after domestic IP\naddresses. Further, there is no certainty that an individual participating in the discussion will\nact on his or her comments, there were mass numbers of people involved (each with a\ndifferent IP address, ISP, and host state to deal with), and there is no solid legal apparatus in\nplace to deal with such an undertaking. Nonetheless, there was a growing and visible threat.\n\nEstonian officials may have been better off devoting their resources to plant online\noperatives. These operatives could have placed well thought out comments to try and sway\nthe crowd. Rather than spending all resources on physical prevention, some resources could\nbe used to train operatives in PSYOPS, mob mentality, propaganda, and logical deterrents\nsuch as subtly mentioning flaws in their arguments, or the consequences of participating in\nsuch an attack. In order to be effective this would also require an in-depth understanding of\ninternet subcultures (List of Internet Phenomena 2008; Pang 2008; Slashdot Subculture 2008;\nSlashdot Trolling Phenomenon 2008). Subtle techniques, such as self-deprecating humour,\ncan sway the crowd’s emotions and train of thought (Landler and Markoff 2007). Russian\ngovernment involvement may have been as an instigator, knowingly or not, as “there [were]\nanti-Estonian sentiments, fuelled by Russian state propaganda, and the sentiments were\nvoiced in articles, blogs, forums and the press” (The Cyber Raiders Hitting Estonia 2007).\nThis could be a type of outsourcing of activity that provides a low cost attack with high\ndeniability. Once in the hands of an unwitting mob, the tools necessary are readily available\nand the means are simple, thereby coordinating a massive data request simultaneously. On an\nindividual level it takes very little effort, yet as a combined whole it has devastating effect\nwith emergent sophistication. This small individual role, may also cause participants to feel\nless responsible (Estonia Fines Man for 'Cyber War' 2008).\n\n**Legality**\n\nIn addition to the difficulty of identifying the source of a cyber attack, a lack of legal\nframework to deal with such an attack makes it exceedingly problematic. Only one person\n\n60\n\n\n-----\n\nhas been charged and convicted in connection with the Estonian attacks. Dmitri\nGalushkevich was fined 17,500 kroons for attacking the Reform Party website. Galushkevich\nadmitted to his assault on the site, and he is believed to have acted alone. Several leads in\nidentifying other potential participants in the Estonian attacks relied on Russian cooperation.\nEstonia made a formal investigation assistance request under a Mutual Legal Assistance\nTreaty (MLAT) between the states. Moscow appeared as though it would help, but after a\ndelay in action, it ultimately refused to cooperate, stating that the proposed investigation was\nnot covered by the MLAT. Further, the Head of the Russian Military Forecasting Centre\nstated that the attacks against Estonia had not violated any international agreements because\nno such agreements exist (Alo 2007; Sobrale 2007). A pro-Kremlin youth movement called\nThe Commissar of the Nashi, claimed responsibility for some of the attacks – however, the\ngroup is located within Moldova and Transnistria which are beyond the jurisdiction of\nInterpol and no MLAT applies. This severely hampers the investigation as pursuing all-EU\narrest warrants for these suspects would be largely a symbolic gesture (Commissar of Nashi\n2007; Estonia Fines Man for 'Cyber War' 2008; Ministry of Internal Affairs 2007).\n\n**International Publicity**\n\nRegardless of whether the attacks were state-sponsored, the Estonian incident brought cyber\nwarfare to the attention of the global community. The case was studied intensively by many\ncountries and military planners, since it was believed to have been state-sponsored and a\nmodern example of a large-scale attack. Experts from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\n(NATO), the European Commission, and organisations from the US and Israel were\ndispatched to offer assistance and collect first hand analysis of the event. The implications\nare far reaching: “For NATO, the attack may lead to a discussion of whether it needs to\nmodify its commitment to collective defense, enshrined in Article V of the North Atlantic\nTreaty” (Landler and Markoff 2007). There is no precedence for an attack of this type. If a\nstate’s communications centre is attacked by a missile, it is considered an act of war. But\nwhat is the response to a cyber attack on that same installation, with the same debilitating\neffect? The Estonian attacks have encouraged the development of a NATO Cybernetic\nDefence Centre in Estonia. This is an extension of Estonia’s 1996 push for the expansion of\ncomputer and network infrastructure in Estonia, nicknamed the Tiger’s Leap (Bright 2007; A\nCyber-Riot 2007; Estonia Has No Evidence of Kremlin Involvement 2007).\n\n**Georgia**\n\nThe 2008 war between Russia and Georgia over South Ossetia appeared to mirror the\nEstonian attacks, hinting that cyber warfare may become a standard addition to traditional\nwarfare, whether that be state-sponsored or not. Hours after fighting broke out, “Russian\nhackers had established a site, StopGeorgia.ru, where visitors could view a list of Georgian\nwebsites being targeted, showing which sites had been successfully brought down, and\ndownload a simple program that enabled their own computer to join the attack” (Waterman\n2008). The attacks included DDoS attacks from six different botnets against government and\nnews websites, webpage defacements, spamming, the distribution of Georgian officials’\nemail addresses, and distribution of a list of Georgian websites with known security flaws.\nThe level of sophistication and intensity of the Georgian attacks surpassed that of the\nEstonian attacks, showing that capability is increasing. Russian-based hackers tried to halt\nthe Georgian hacker community from responding, by taking down the two highest-profile\nGeorgian hacker sites, hacker.ge and warez.ge, in their initial assault (Waterman 2008).\nHowever, Georgian hackers did respond, going after Russian news sites, and in some cases,\n\n61\n\n\n-----\n\nspoofing those sites to redirect traffic to pro-Georgian news sources (Coleman 2008; Griggs\n2008). Georgian officials asserted that the Russian military was behind the attacks, but they\ncould not provide concrete evidence. Regardless, it represents a new aspect to warfare that\nmust be taken into account. Patriotic cyber attacks may now accompany all traditional wars.\nIf this is not shaped according to government objectives, it runs the risk of undermining\noperations. For example, patriotic cyber attacks could damage soft power, they could incite\ndamaging retaliatory attacks, and they could drag state powers into conflict.\n\n**Chanology**\n\nChina may wish to tap into the power of a broader range of internet users, those who are not\ngovernment sponsored, nor skilled hackers, yet have wide-ranging knowledge of the internet\nthrough frequent use. In one view:\n\nI've always argued that I do not believe the patriotic hackers are dedicated government\nagents, but I do believe that they are treated as useful idiots by the Chinese regime, and that\nthe Chinese regime has figured out a rough method, using the propaganda apparatus, to\nshape the behavior of these patriotic hacker groups, many of whom are getting older and\ngoing from black hat to gray hat to white hat, and they want wives and jobs and houses, and\nthe only way to get certified as an information security professional in China is to be certified\nby the ministries of public and state security. (China’s Proliferation Practices, and the\nDevelopment of Its Cyber and Space Warfare Capabilities 2008)\n\nA powerful array of tools is openly available to anyone with an internet connection, and they\nrequire little effort to learn. Free web-space, image and video uploading sites, such as blogs,\nFlickr and YouTube, give anyone with an internet connection multimedia sharing tools that\nrival traditional media. Social networking sites, such as Facebook and Digg, provide\nadditional means to spread this information to a massive audience which, given enough\npopularity, draws in the traditional media as well. China can use propaganda and PSYOPs to\ninfluence this crowd, using it as a political tool. For example, it can be used to organise\nprotest and cyber attacks denouncing Japan’s lack of remorse for WWII atrocities, to criticize\nFalun Gong followers, or to rally support for the One China Policy (Faiola 2005). Project\nChanology gives insight into how these non-hacker internet users can come together towards\na common goal of disruption using the rapid growth of available internet capabilities. It also\nillustrates a growing need to understand these emergent communities as they pose a nontraditional security threat.\n\nProject Chanology was a series of cyber attacks and real life protests organised over the\ninternet against the Church of Scientology (CoS). The CoS is the largest organization\ndevoted to the practice and promotion of the Scientology belief system. They are often\ncriticized as being a cult which tries to exploit people for financial gain. A loose group of\ninternet users named Anonymous orchestrated attacks against the CoS using multiple image\nboards, such as 4chan, 7chan, 12chan, 420chan, and 711chan, as well as supplementary\nwikis, IRC channels, YouTube, Facebook, Slashdot, Digg, and Encyclopaedia Dramatica.\nUsers of the channels are collectively known as Anonymous, or anon, due to the website’s\nuse of anonymous posting; however their internet networks extend beyond the image boards.\nA large and diverse population of internet users identify with the name Anonymous, many\nhaving differing viewpoints and objectives. This point is often lost on the media, who\nmistakenly believe Anonymous represents a cohesive group. Anonymous is connected, but\nthe nodes which connect each member are not the same, and therefore they do not all rally to\nthe same cause.\n\n62\n\n\n-----\n\nProject Chanology was officially launched in the form of a video posted on YouTube on\nJanuary 21, 2008. The video stated that the attacks where in response to Scientology’s\ninternet censorship, dubious recruitment tactics, saturating of disaster areas to ‘help’ victims,\nand overall belief system. Of particular contention was Scientology’s forced removal of a\nleaked Tom Cruise video interview, in which he expounded his love for Scientology.\nAdditional complaints against the CoS include the removal of leaked Scientology belief\ndocuments (part of a 10-year legal battle against Karin Spaink and several ISPs), and the\nattempted removal of the newsgroup alt.religion.scientology from Usenet, which led the\nhacker group Cult of the Dead Cow to declare war on the Church of Scientology as early as\n1995. Anonymous’s stated intent was to ‘expel the church from the internet’ and to ‘save\npeople from Scientology by reversing the brainwashing’. This was followed by DDoS\nattacks, black faxes, prank calls, false deliveries to CoS buildings, the dissemination of\nChurch leaders personal information (telephone numbers, social security numbers, and\naddresses), and the publishing of the contended leaked material on a wide range of websites.\n\nProject Chanology members grew to approximately 9,000 people. They successfully took\ndown the Scientology website on January 18, 2008 with a mid-range DDoS attack. By\ncomparison a botnet can launch a simultaneous attack from 50,000 computers. Nonetheless,\nAnonymous managed to cripple the Scientology website for a period of two weeks. In\nresponse to the attacks, the CoS moved its internet domain to a more secure provider. The\noriginal declaration of war video, which utilized a synthesized voice, was viewed over two\nmillion times within 18 days of its release. Project Chanology garnered mainstream media\ncoverage on an international scale. Mainstream media’s attention created an unintended\nDDoS attack by drawing more attention to the CoS website. Anonymous further raised\nquestions about Scientology’s actions, including the death of Lisa McPherson, a scientologist\nwho died in 1995, for which the CoS was previously under federal investigation.\nAnonymous used a Google bomb technique to make the Scientology.org website the first\nresult in a Google search for ‘dangerous cult’ (McMillan 2008; O’Connell 2008; Vamosi\n2008; Cook 2008; Single 2008; Ramadge 2008; The Passion of Anonymous 2008).\n\nUtilizing a wide range of online communication tools, and a new YouTube video titled “Call\nto Action”, Anonymous coordinated a series of protests. In the video anon states: ‘We have\nno leaders, no single entity directing us.’ On February 10, 2008, approximately 7,000 people\nprotested throughout 100 cities in 14 countries. Protesters wore Guy Fawkes masks from the\nV for Vendetta film, and made Rick Astley's pop single \"Never Gonna Give You Up\", a\ntheme song for the protests against Scientology. The seemingly bizarre and childish\nbehaviour of Anonymous is a part of their cohesion, a subculture of memes, slang, and\nhumour. A second series of protests began on March 15, 2008, with approximately 7,000 to\n8,000 protestors throughout 100 cities in 10 countries. CoS has not released an official\nestimate of the financial damage caused by Project Chanology. However, they have publicly\nstated that they were forced to increase online security, hired off-duty police officers to\nprovide physical security at their churches, and have suffered increasing negative press and\nscrutiny from the US Federal Bureau of Investigation. CoS has denounced Anonymous as\ncyber terrorists and Anonymous has since switched its campaign to go after Scientology’s\ntax-exempt status.\n\nChina could use online operatives to incite this type of internet based ‘mob’. It could be used\nconstructively within China, such as undermining the Falun Gong, or destructively against an\nenemy country, such as inciting protests against pro-democracy Taiwanese leadership.\n\n63\n\n\n-----\n\nAdditionally, these online communities pose a security threat, and should therefore be\nexamined if only as a means of deterrence. As mentioned in IO, this sort of emergent mob is\nnot one that can be quickly understood. To be used as a military tool, China would need a\ndeep understanding of the asset’s culture. In the case of Anonymous, this equates to a heavy\nreliance on inside jokes, slang, internet and pop culture. Anonymous uses humour to unite\nand to obfuscate logic and responsibility. Credence within the group may come from inside\njokes and creativity, rather than sound information – they even revel in their own failure.\nInternet communities can lack a centre of command, and be composed of serious, moderate,\nand casual participants, all of whom may change their level of participation on a whim.\n\n**5.** **Assassin’s Mace**\n\nAssassin’s Mace, or shashoujian, is used in Chinese military writings to describe a weapon or\ntactic ‘which can deliver decisive blows in carefully calculated surprise moves and change\nthe balance of power’ (Johnston 2002). Similar concepts can be seen throughout China’s\nhistory, from Sun Zi’s (tr. 1963) _The Art of War to Mao Zedong’s (tr. 2000)_ _On Guerrilla_\n_Warfare. An assassin’s mace gains strength by ignoring pre-established rules of conduct. It_\nhas many similarities to asymmetric warfare, such as being a novel way to level the playing\nfield, but it differs in that it is a decisive weapon, aimed at incapacitating an enemy,\n‘suddenly and totally’ (Navrozov 2005). China possesses several asymmetric, highly\ndevastating weapons, such as a limited but modernising nuclear weapons capacity, China’s\nASAT capability, and its electromagnetic pulse (EMP) capability. However each of these has\nconsiderable drawbacks. For example, human rights and environmental concerns have\nrelegated nuclear weapons to the role of deterrent and introduced limited warfare. By using\ncyber warfare, China could achieve the same asymmetric destructive power while bypassing\nthe drawbacks.\n\nIt is unlikely that China would use kinetic kill weaponry, such as its direct ascent ASAT, in\nan attempt to disrupt US space based assets. To disrupt US satellite dominance would require\na massive sky clearing operation, because the US has constellations of satellites with multiple\nredundancy. The US GPS provides tactical communication and precision navigation, making\nit a desirable target – however, the GPS uses at least five space satellite constellations. When\none is destroyed, others can be manoeuvred to fill holes in the net. Not all of these satellites\nare within striking range at any given time. This means a sky clearing operation would take a\nsignificant amount of time, thereby revealing Beijing’s intentions. This would cause\ninternational dispute due to space debris, and allow the US to manoeuvre its other satellites\nout of harm’s way. It would risk retaliation in which China would be at a disadvantage.\nAdditionally, there is no guarantee an attempt would be successful, as each launch requires\nprecise targeting, and China’s ASAT has only been tested once. It is more likely China\nwould attempt to knock out the corresponding relay stations on Earth by using a cyber attack.\nChinese tacticians have focused on neutralising the uplinks and downlinks of the space-based\nsystems through diverse forms of cyber attack including simple DoS attack. This gives the\nadvantages of deniability and low cost. It would remove distance from the equation, allowing\nmultiple targets to be taken out simultaneously regardless of location, and it would remove\ninternational condemnation and/or involvement (Waterman 2008; Tellis 2007; International\nAssessment and Strategy Center 2005).\n\nChina could destroy a vast majority of US electronics, including computers, cars, phones, and\nthe power grid, using EMP weaponry. This is something of which all nuclear armed states\n\n64\n\n\n-----\n\nare capable by means of high altitude nuclear explosions, taking as few as three to blanket the\ncontinental US (Electromagnetic Pulse 2005). Open source materials have shown the US,\nChina, France, and Russia all using an EMP burst as a surprise first strike in war games\n(China’s Proliferation Practices, and the Development of Its Cyber and Space Warfare\nCapabilities 2008; Winn 2008; Nock and Lizun 2007; Qian and Wang 1999). However, it is\nunlikely China would use such brute-force tactics. Using a high altitude atomic burst would\ncause international outrage as it violates an international treaty, it damages the environment,\nand it indiscriminately disrupts everything in its blast radius. Alternatively, shutting down\nthe US power grid, production lines, water utilities, chemical plants, telecommunications, and\ntransportation routes is possible through cyber attack, and it would provide the benefit of\ndeniability. Details on how such an attack would be conducted are scarce in OSINT as\ngovernments do not wish to publicize their weaknesses or give away their assets. It is\nimportant however that they do acknowledge them, since any computer system which is\nconnected to the internet is vulnerable to attack. In 2008, the CIA reported that multiple\ncities outside the US had their electrical power shut off by hackers. The reports were vague,\nsupposedly due to security concerns; however it was reported that the attacks came from\nonline, through the internet, not by physical means (Bridis 2008; McMillan 2008).\n\n**Weapons of Mass Disruption**\n\nOSINT continually points to cyber warfare being capable of crippling a state’s electric power\ntransmission, transportation systems, and communications systems (Phone Phreaking 2008;\nWeber 2008; Trahan 2008; McMillan 2007; Tkacik 2007; Reid 2007; Robson 2004;\nMiklaszewski 1999). If the Russian government was behind the cyber attacks on Estonia, it\ndid not use such a dramatic assault. The Russians may simply have been testing their cyber\nwarfare capabilities, saving their most devastating capability for when it is needed most, as it\nmay only work once. Such an attack would cripple the flow of goods, effectively starving the\npopulation and shutting down business. Evidence that such a possibility exists can be seen\nacross the globe. In 1997, a teenager shut down air and ground communication at a US\nairport in Massachusetts, and in 2000, the Russian government announced that hackers had\nsucceeded in taking control of the world’s largest natural gas pipeline network, Gazprom, by\nusing a type of Trojan. In 2000, Vitek Boden took control of a sewage pumping station in\nAustralia. He remotely triggered the release of a million litres of sewage into public\nwaterways (Barker 2002). Computers and manuals seized in Al Qaeda training camps\ncontained large amounts of SCADA information related to dams and critical infrastructure.\nIn 2003, the Slammer Worm took a US nuclear power plant’s safety monitoring system\noffline, and the Blaster Worm was connected with a massive blackout in the Eastern US\n(Maynor and Graham 2006).\n\nThe United States is particularly vulnerable as much of the communication, manufacturing,\nwater, transportation, and energy infrastructure is owned by the private sector, as opposed to\nChina and Russia where infrastructure is predominantly in the hands of the government\n(Greenemeier 2007). The relative ease with which the Titan Rain attacks were conducted\nmake private sector computer networks look like an easy target (Almeida 2006). The\ngovernment and defence installations are heavily funded for security, whereas the private\nsector is not. Initially the US power grid control systems were on closed networks (not\nconnected to the internet). However, over time companies began deciding it was too costly to\nmaintain separate networks. The internet became essential for operations, meaning they\nwould need two separate systems for operation, one connected and one not. Through the\ndecision-making process companies decided it was cheaper to have only the one that was\n\n65\n\n\n-----\n\nconnected, but focus on keeping it secure. Over time security became lax, and no network\nthat is connected can be entirely secure. Many of these systems do not support\nauthentication, encryption, or basic validation protocols; of those that do support them, most\nrun with security features disabled (Maynor and Graham 2006). In addition to the internet,\nSCADA systems may be compromised through outdated modems used for maintenance\npurposes, wireless access points, or roaming notebooks. Further, power companies may buy\nand trade power amongst themselves, so loopholes designed to check available capacity have\nprovided another entry point (Winkler 2007). The vulnerability of the private sector’s\ncomputer network, due to a lack of understanding or a lack of incentive, provides China (or\nother cyber-capable groups) with the opportunity to cripple US infrastructure.\n\n**Point of Sale**\n\nUsing a modern fuel service station as a parallel for a cyber attack on commercial\ninfrastructure, one can see the debilitating effects of a cyber attack. Magnetic stripe cards\nhave replaced tangible notes as the primary method of payment. By overwhelming a bank\nthrough something as simple as a DDoS attack, an adversary could knock the point of sale\nbanking system offline. Few service stations are equipped to handle this for duration longer\nthan one day, and the Estonian attacks demonstrated a month-long capability. Lines in the\nstore would grow as the speed of transactions dramatically slowed. Nearby ATMs would be\ntaxed as people begin withdrawing more notes. As the ATM runs out of its supply of money,\nan internal alert is sent to notify the ATM provider to send an armoured car to restock the\nmachine. This would require additional workflow, disrupting a fine tuned system of\nallocated staff hours and drivers. The long lines at the register would disrupt the productivity\nand efficiency of working customers who are unaccustomed to the long wait, and it would\nradiate frustration and anger throughout the community.\n\nAs the service line grows and employees struggle to keep up, the amount of store theft (fuel\nand merchandise) increases. More hours would be allocated to review surveillance footage,\nand the local police would be inundated with cases of theft. Panic may ensue, as seen with\nsmall disruptions at service stations, comparable to the temporary collapse of Optus\ntelecommunications or the temporary collapse of Westpac banking (Streem 2008). A\nsustained disruption could lead to mob mentality. The fragility of social order was\ndemonstrated in 2008 when fuel price increases led to widespread violent protests across the\nglobe, including Argentina, Belgium, France, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Portugal, South\nKorea, Spain, Thailand, and the UK (Arrests Following Jakarta Fuel Price Increases 2008;\nBanerjee and Zappei 2008; Cowell 2008; Fuel Demo Adds To Road Taxes Row 2008;\nIndonesia: Growing Fuel Price Protests Meet Repression 2008; Thai Truckers Join Global\nFuel Price Protest 2008).\n\nAlternatively, the registers themselves are operated by using the internet and could be\ntargeted. China could bypass banking systems, energy providers, transportation systems, or\ncommunications systems and go after the less guarded, and less funded, point-of-sale\nsoftware. Few service stations remain in the western world that use unconnected registers, as\nit would be difficult to remain competitive. Similarly, there are few competitors in the\nservice station industry due to strong competition. This means there are only a small group\nof service station vendors within a large city, and all of the computers within those companies\nare running off of the same network. The six largest non-state owned energy companies,\nknown as super majors, are: Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell, BP, Chevron Corporation,\nConocoPhillips, and Total SA. These six companies control the vast majority of service\n\n66\n\n\n-----\n\nstations (SBDCNET 2001). This is sometimes obscured by the use of alternative store\nnames, despite being contracted to a supermajor, or the continued use of an old company\nname despite having been bought out by a supermajor. This illustrates a lack of diversity in\nthe retail industry. By attacking only a few targets, an entire city’s service stations could be\nknocked offline. There are a limited number of independent operators within a typical city;\nhowever their numbers are too few to facilitate the influx of customers from the larger\ncompetitors.\n\nWithout the online register, PLUs (price look-up codes) cannot scan and prices would have to\nbe manually added. Any extended duration of this process could shutdown a store, and\ndepending on the system, fuel may not be able to be dispensed without the computer. Service\nstations are not known for their sophistication in computer defence as they routinely tighten\nbudgets to their limits and they have not seen a need to harden this infrastructure. As\ncommunity hostility rises, employees may resign due to stress. It would be difficult training\nnew employees during this time with extended lines and the employees themselves suffering\nan inability to access fuel. New staff would also cause lost time and money for training. All\ndelivery trucks create online invoices sent and received by the service station. Assuming\nthey are able to maintain the fuel for their trucks, they would be forced to adapt to old\nmethods of interaction and record keeping. A store’s stock might also suffer shortages from\nhoarding of products due to panic in the community.\n\nThese systems could be attacked solely online, or operatives could be placed into the store to\nlearn the system’s weaknesses and install malware directly. Operations could be expanded\nbeyond a service station to attack grocery and a wide range of retail outlets. Rather than\ngoing after the transport of goods, it may be easier to disrupt them online at their point of\nsale. The effects would radiate outward, knocking down additional infrastructure unable to\nhandle the increased stress. A service station is only one example of weak commercial\ninfrastructure that relies on computers to operate. If China could gain market dominance in\nthe point of sale software industry, or in the registers used for sales, it would gain an even\ngreater access to disruption. This disruption could be used as a deterrent, as blackmail, or as\na force multiplier in traditional warfare.\n\n**Market Dominance**\n\nChina may seek to establish market dominance in the production of ICT software and\nhardware as a means of increasing its cyber warfare capability. On an infrastructure level,\nChina could seek to control ownership of submarine cable infrastructure allowing it further\naccess to cyber reconnaissance or the option of shutting down portions of internet\nconnectivity during times of war (Whitney 2008; Of Cables and Conspiracies 2008). Further,\nif China could unseat Microsoft as the industry standard in software, it could install\nbackdoors, latent viruses, or remotely triggered ex-filtration devices. This type of tactic was\nexamined in section 3, above (Cyber Reconnaissance and Attack), with Sony BMG’s use of\nrootkits. China used legal and financial prowess to convince Microsoft to teach its software\nengineers how to insert their own software into Window’s applications. As a part of the\nChinese argument for doing so, was an insistence that Microsoft Windows was a secret tool\nof the US government. By providing China with “skeleton keys” to the Windows Operating\nSystem, inadvertently China was given advanced knowledge on how to infiltrate foreign\ncomputers and craft advanced exploits (Marsal 2008; Tkacik 2007).\n\n67\n\n\n-----\n\nUS concerns over Chinese market dominance have begun to surface. In 2006, the State\nDepartment banned the purchase of computers from the Lenovo Group, the Chinese firm that\nacquired the IBM personal computing division, following penetrations using a zero-day flaw\nin Microsoft software. China is also growing in the field of microchips, something other\nstates need for defence related electronics. Not only could China embed exploits, but also\ndominance in this field gives it access to critical individuals and information through\npartnership, such as a chance to liaise with industry insiders, come close to sensitive\ninformation and hardware, and conduct social engineering or HUMINT. In 2003, the Huawei\nShenzhen Technology Company was charged with stealing secrets and wholesale pirating of\nCisco software, a US company. In 2007, Huawei then attempted to buy 3Com, a US\ncompany which supplies the US government with security software, routers, and servers.\nIndia turned down a $60 million Huawei investment deal in 2005 after concerns over cyber\nreconnaissance, noting that Huawei is the same company that conducts sweeping and\ndebugging of the Chinese embassy. India’s Defence Ministry stated ‘the choice was between\ncheap Chinese equipment and national security’ (Tkacik 2007).\n\nChina consistently reverse engineers ICT hardware and software in an attempt to maintain a\nstronghold on its own markets. This can be seen with the reverse engineering of Skype\nProtocol and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), and ‘knock offs’ of the iPhone (VoIP\nWkiBlog 2006). The One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) project, which has the potential to\nrapidly spread internet connectivity to China’s remaining population, uses an open source\noperating system and software, helping to free China from US owned Microsoft. Yet China\nhas denounced the sale of OLPC, promoting instead various domestic versions that were\nreversed engineered from the OLPC model. Further, the Chinese have secured\nmanufacturing rights to produce OLPC within China even though they do not intend to\npromote OLPC sales domestically (O’Brien 2008). China also has a history of reverse\nengineering websites that become popular and profitable in the Western world; examples\ninclude clones of YouTube, Google, MySpace, Facebook, Wikipedia, and eBay being\nYoQoo, Baidu, Baidu Space, Xiaonei/Zhanzuo, Baidu Baike/Hoodong, and Taobao\nrespectively (Marshall 2008; Wei 2008; Burns 2006).\n\n**Peacetime Operations**\n\nDuring peacetime, China is likely to rely on cyber reconnaissance to gather information and\ncatalogue exploits/weaknesses in the US military and infrastructure. Automobile companies,\nfood services, oil companies, financial institutions, and telecommunications all play a vital\nrole in supporting military operations, as well as housing technological advances, expertise,\nand inside information which could prove useful for leapfrogging (Winkler 2005).\nTechnology transfer allows China to skip years of costly research and development, and it\nremoves the competitive edge of foreign militaries and companies (Tkacik 2007). In\nunrestricted fashion, China may also seek advantage during peacetime to battle military\nexport restrictions of the EU, purchase vital capital in the US financial system, and help\nshape the international legal structure being developed for cyber warfare. Cyber\nreconnaissance against US military logistics networks could reveal force deployment\ninformation, such as the names of ships deployed, readiness status of various units, timing\nand destination of deployments, and rendezvous schedules. It could also reveal the details of\nweaponry sold to Taiwan.\n\nChina has repeatedly shown interest in the US Unclassified but Sensitive Internet Protocol\nRouter Network (NIPRNet) (China’s Proliferation Practices, and the Development of Its\n\n68\n\n\n-----\n\nCyber and Space Warfare Capabilities 2008). NIPRNet is used to exchange unclassified but\nsensitive information between internal users. The network is connected to the broader\ninternet to improve collaboration between scientists and officers located in different\norganizations and in remote locations. This means it can provide intruders with data such as\n‘ballistic weapons research, aircraft and ship design, military payroll, personnel records,\nprocurement, modelling of battlefield environments, and computer security research’ (Lewis\n1994). The US places classified military information on the Secret Internet Protocol Router\nNetwork (SIPRNet) and secret information on the Joint Worldwide Intelligence\nCommunications System (JWICS). While these networks are not connected to the internet,\nexamining NIPRNet may give insight into the contents through cross talk, or it may provide a\nmeans of escalating privileges, providing information on how to access SIPRNet and JWICS\neither directly or indirectly via an asset.\n\n**Taiwan**\n\nChina can use the internet to manipulate the Taiwanese populace, either to set up for an\nattack, or to undermine Taiwan independence peacefully and avoid conflict altogether. This\nmay include PSYOPS/propaganda, recruitment and identification of sympathizers, or\ncataloguing of cyber and defence weaknesses. For example, an internet rumour in 1999 that\na Chinese Su-27 had shot down a Taiwan aircraft caused the Taipei stock market to drop\nmore than two percent in less than four hours. An earthquake in 1999 and a typhoon in 2001\nrevealed weaknesses in Taiwan’s telecommunications, electric power, and transportation\ninfrastructure; weaknesses which could be targeted in physical sabotage. Further, a landslide\nrevealed that the loss of a single power grid tower is capable of knocking out 90 percent of\nthe power grid in the central mountainous region. Building information, including the\nlocation of the President’s office, and daily activities, are openly available on the internet.\nThis is even more significant given the lack of security present during the 2004 assassination\nattempt on President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu (China’s Proliferation\nPractices, and the Development of Its Cyber and Space Warfare Capabilities 2008; Taiwan\nAssassin 2004).\n\nIn the event of a Taiwan conflict, China could use cyber attacks to delay US involvement\nlong enough for Taiwan to capitulate. For example, China could go after the US logistical\napparatus, using information gained via NIPRNet, in order to delay the force deployment\nphase. This would include the organization of forces, food supplies, uniforms, and/or\ncommunication which are often organised through networks that are connected to the\ninternet. Cyber attack could also delay re-supply to the region by misdirecting stores, fuel,\nand munitions, corrupting or deleting inventory files, and thereby hindering mission\ncapability. If the Chinese lack the capability to find exploits in NIPRNet, they could simply\nconduct DDoS attacks to bring it down long enough for a Taiwanese surrender. While\ndelaying the US, China could use traditional military forces in concert with cyber warfare\nagainst Taiwan. The cyber warfare component could include online PSYOPS, media\nwarfare, special forces aided by cyber reconnaissance information, and cyber attacks against\nTaiwan’s point of sale and banking infrastructure.\n\n**6.** **Conclusion**\n\nThis research has shown that China seeks to leapfrog in military competitiveness by utilizing\ncyber warfare. Chinese military doctrine places an emphasis on asymmetric attack. Cyber\n\n69\n\n\n-----\n\nwarfare epitomizes this a low cost means of levelling the playing field. Cyber attack strikes\nat a superior adversary’s weakness – in the case of the US, a heavy reliance on hi-tech\ncomputerized weaponry and a civilian population reliant on an unsecured computer\ninfrastructure. Cyber reconnaissance follows China’s tradition of technology transfer and\nreverse engineering for domestic production as a means of leapfrogging. Cyber\nreconnaissance gives the added benefit of providing deniability, low cost, a lack of legal\nframework against it, and the removal of geographical distance. Foreign allegations, such as\nthe Titan Rain incursions, suggest China is making rapid progress in cyber reconnaissance\nand attack capabilities. The PRC openly states in its National Defense White Paper that it is\nseeking informationization and modernization of the PLA. This follows the US, China’s\nperceived greatest threat, in its pursuit of NCW, IO, and FCS. Cataloguing adversary\nweaknesses not only provides an asymmetric advantage in the event of a conflict, it also acts\nas a deterrent while China catches up in traditional military might. By utilizing cyber\nreconnaissance, China can accelerate its advancement in hi-tech weaponry. Unrestricted\nwarfare has shown a blurring of the lines between military and non-military spheres. China\ncan tap into the power of its online population for military purposes, such as seen in the\nEstonian, Georgian and Chanology case studies. Following the US example of IO, China can\nleverage the internet as a means of boosting soft power. Using cyber reconnaissance, the\nChinese can gain market dominance in the fields of ICT.  This will provide increased cyber\nsecurity, by removing foreign influence, and it will provide improved cyber offence, such as\npre-installed exploits or ownership of internet infrastructure. Market dominance also relates\nto financial gain, which China has stated is intrinsically related to military capabilities and\nstrategic interests.\n\n**References**\n\n[Adams, Eric. 2004.
