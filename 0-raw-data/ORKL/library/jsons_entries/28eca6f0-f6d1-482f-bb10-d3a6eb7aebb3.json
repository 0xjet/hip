This attack is thought\nto be of Chinese origins and utilized the Winnti backdoor.\n\nThe company behind the highly popular TeamViewer remote desktop software told German\npublisher Der Spiegel that the attack was discovered before the threat group was capable\nof doing any damage, with experts and investigators failing to find any evidence of data\nbeing stolen during the security incident.\n\nAlso, no evidence was found that the hackers were able to compromise or steal source\ncode even though they had access to it, according to TeamViewer .\n\nBackdoors which might have been planted during the 2016 attack have also been removed\nafter a data center overhaul and all systems \"completely checked, cleaned up and\n[repositioned\" at the end of 2016 according to the Der Spiegel report.](https://www.spiegel.de/plus/teamviewer-wie-hacker-das-deutsche-vorzeige-start-up-ausspionierten-a-00000000-0002-0001-0000-000163955857)\n\nWhen asked by BleepingComputer about when and how the breach was discovered,\nTeamViewer said they detected the attack before any major damage was done.\n\n\n-----\n\nLike many technology leaders, TeamViewer is frequently confronted with attacks by\ncybercriminals. For this reason, we continuously invest in the advancement of our IT\nsecurity and cooperate closely with globally renowned experts and institutions in this field.\n\nIn autumn 2016, TeamViewer was target of a cyber-attack. Our systems detected the\nsuspicious activities in time to prevent any major damage. An expert team of internal and\nexternal cyber security researchers, working together closely with the responsible\nauthorities, successfully fended off the attack.\"\n\nSeeing that the hackers were not able to steal any data during the attack,\nTeamViewer decided not to publish a security breach notification to inform the users of the\nincident.\n\nRegarding the reasons behind the decision to not disclose the breach, a TeamViewer\nspokesperson further told BleepingComputer that based on consultation with relevant\nauthorities and advisors, it was decided that it was not necessary to disclose the attack.\n\nIndependent experts conducted a thorough investigation using all IT forensic\nresources available and found no evidence that the security of our users or their IT systems\nwas affected in any way.\n\nTogether with the relevant authorities and our security advisors, we came to the\njoint conclusion that informing our users was not necessary and would have been\ncounterproductive to the effective prosecution of the attackers. Against this backdrop, we\ndecided not to disclose the incident publicly in the interest of the global fight against\ncybercrime and thus also in the interest of our users.\n[Attackers have also used the Winnti malware against ThyssenKrupp in 2016 and Bayer in](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/asian-hackers-stole-technical-trade-secrets-from-german-steelmaker-thyssenkrupp/)\n2018, with ThyssenKrupp CERT investigators monitoring their activity and discovering that\nthe hackers were only interested in stealing technical trade secrets.\n\nIn the case of the attack against the largest drugmaker from Germany, investigators from\nthe [DCSO cybersecurity group — set up by Bayer with help from Allianz, BASF and](https://twitter.com/DCSO_de)\nVolkswagen — were also able to keep an eye on the group's activity since the initial\ninfiltration in early-2018 until March 2019 and also concluded that the hackers were not able\nto steal any data.\n\n## Service outage due to DoS attack during the summer of 2016\n\nOn June 1, 2016, TeamViewer issued a press release acknowledging a service outage\ncaused by a denial-of-service attack (DoS) which targeted the TeamViewer DNS server\ninfrastructure.\n\nThis statement followed multiple user reports claiming that attackers took control of their\ncomputers using TeamViewer and using their PayPal accounts to either make online\n[purchases or steal money — a list was also created to track all the reported incidents](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Cmxz2VHMKsi96WZ3enTGuXShmXcW8Vg5sYFaXK8kmxg/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n\n-----\n\nSome of the victims also claimed that the attackers successfully compromised their\nTeamViewer accounts even though they used unique very long passwords or had TwoFactor Authentication enabled, leading them to believe that TeamViewer's computing\n[systems were hacked [1,](https://www.reddit.com/r/teamviewer/comments/4m4a5n/psa_2factorauthentication_use_it/d3snp7k) [2,](https://www.reddit.com/r/teamviewer/comments/4jr9qn/hacked_trough_teamviewer_1800_spent_on_paypal/d3a5tcf) [3].](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/4m7ay6/teamviewer_has_been_hacked_they_are_denying/)\n\nHowever, in their press release, TeamViewer blamed the account hacks reported by its\nusers on \"Careless use of account credentials remains to be a key problem for all internet\nservices. This particularly includes the use of the same password across multiple user\naccounts with various internet services.\"\n\nTeamViewer also mentioned the possibility of some users having unintentionally\ndownloaded and installed programs infected with malware which could have allowed\nattackers to \"virtually do anything with that particular system – depending on how intricate\nthe malware is, it can capture the entire system, seize or manipulate information, and so\nforth.\"\n\nAfter the user uproar caused by the \"careless\" word used in the June 1 press release,\n[Teamviewer apologized for using the word through public relation manager, Axel Schmidt.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/teamviewer-apologizes-but-still-say-they-were-not-compromised/)\n\nTeamViewer also stated that the hacks reported by users might have had something to do\nwith the Backdoor. TeamViewer malware besides the initial mention of stolen password\ncredentials.\n\nWhen asked if there is any connection between the account hacks reported in 2016 and the\njust disclosed breach, TeamViewer told BleepingComputer that there is no connection.\n\nNo. The cyber-attack on TeamViewer is in no way connected to this.\n\nThe corresponding reports are presumably related to a theft of large amounts of data from\npopular internet services (e.g. LinkedIn) in the same year. If affected users had been using\nidentical passwords for third-party services, such as TeamViewer, it was possible for\nattackers to abuse them for unauthorized access attempts.\n\nTeamViewer generally recommends using unique passwords for different services and\nsetting up a two-factor authentication to effectively prevent this kind of attack.\n\n## The Winnti Umbrella\n\nWhile there is no attribution for the hacking group behind the 2016 attack TeamViewer just\nconfirmed, multiple hacking groups collectively known by experts as the Winnti Umbrella\naccording to ProtectWise 401 TRG, have been using the Winnti malware during their\nattacks.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe [groups come under various names (i.e.,Winnti Group, PassCV, APT17, Axiom, LEAD,](https://401trg.com/burning-umbrella/)\nBARIUM, Wicked Panda, and GREF) but Winnti Group is the first known to have used the\nWinnti backdoor during their campaigns.\n\nAs Kaspersky's GReAT [full report on the Winnti Group from 2013 says, \"The main objective](http://kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/vlpdfs/winnti-more-than-just-a-game-130410.pdf)\nof the group is to steal source code of online game projects as well as digital certificates of\nlegitimate software vendors.\"\n\nBARIUM, another Winnti Umbrella threat group, which mainly targets software and gaming\n[companies [1,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/shadowhammer-targets-multiple-companies-asus-just-one-of-them/) [2] and is still active as shown by its involvement in Operation](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/game-development-companies-backdoored-in-supply-chain-attacks/)\nShadowHammer could be the most probable candidate for this attack.\n\nKaspersky also found evidence that connected the methods and tools used as\npart of [Operation ShadowHammer with the ones employed in the supply chain](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/asus-live-update-infected-with-backdoor-in-supply-chain-attack/)\nattacks [against CCleaner and](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ccleaner-compromised-to-distribute-malware-for-almost-a-month/) [NetSarang from 2017, with the threat actor behind the latter](https://securelist.com/shadowpad-in-corporate-networks/81432/)\n[already having been identified as BARIUM by ESET,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/game-development-companies-backdoored-in-supply-chain-attacks/) [Microsoft, and other](https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/barium.pdf) security\nresearchers.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[GitHub: Attackers stole login details of 100K npm user accounts](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/github-attackers-stole-login-details-of-100k-npm-user-accounts/)\n\n[Hackers target Russian govt with fake Windows updates pushing RATs](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-target-russian-govt-with-fake-windows-updates-pushing-rats/)\n\n[Iranian hackers exposed in a highly targeted espionage campaign](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/iranian-hackers-exposed-in-a-highly-targeted-espionage-campaign/)\n\n[Bitter cyberspies target South Asian govts with new malware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/bitter-cyberspies-target-south-asian-govts-with-new-malware/)\n\n[Hackers display “blood is on your hands\" on Russian TV, take down RuTube](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-display-blood-is-on-your-hands-on-russian-tv-take-down-rutube/)\n\n[Hackers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/hackers/)\n[Security Breach](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/security-breach/)\n[TeamViewer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/teamviewer/)\n[Winnti](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/winnti/)\n\n[Sergiu Gatlan](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/sergiu-gatlan/)\n\nSergiu Gatlan is a reporter who covered cybersecurity, technology, Apple, Google, and a\nfew other topics at Softpedia for more than a decade.
