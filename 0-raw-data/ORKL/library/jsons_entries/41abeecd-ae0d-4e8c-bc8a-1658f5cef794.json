Naylor\n\n[Zach Dorfman, Kim Zetter, Jenna McLaughlin and Sean D. Naylor](https://www.yahoo.com/author/zach-dorfman-kim-zetter-jenna)\nJuly 15, 2020, 4:00 AM·13 min read\n\nIn this article:\n\nOops!\n\nSomething went wrong.\n\nPlease try again later.\n\nDonald Trump\n\n45th President of the United States\n\nThe Central Intelligence Agency has conducted a series of covert cyber operations against\nIran and other targets since winning a secret victory in 2018 when President Trump signed\nwhat amounts to a sweeping authorization for such activities, according to former U.S.\n\n\n-----\n\nofficials with direct knowledge of the matter.\n\nThe secret authorization, known as a presidential finding, gives the spy agency more\nfreedom in both the kinds of operations it conducts and who it targets, undoing many\nrestrictions that had been in place under prior administrations. The finding allows the CIA to\nmore easily authorize its own covert cyber operations, rather than requiring the agency to get\napproval from the White House.\n\nUnlike previous presidential findings that have focused on a specific foreign policy objective\nor outcome — such as preventing Iran from becoming a nuclear power — this directive,\ndriven by the National Security Council and crafted by the CIA, focuses more broadly on a\ncapability: covert action in cyberspace.\n\nThe “very aggressive” finding “gave the agency very specific authorities to really take the\nfight offensively to a handful of adversarial countries,” said a former U.S. government official.\nThese countries include Russia, China, Iran and North Korea — which are mentioned\ndirectly in the document — but the finding potentially applies to others as well, according to\nanother former official. “The White House wanted a vehicle to strike back,” said the second\nformer official. “And this was the way to do it.”\n\nPresident Trump and the CIA. (Photo illustration: Yahoo News; photos: AP(3), Getty Images)\n\nThe CIA’s new powers are not about hacking to collect intelligence. Instead, they open the\nway for the agency to launch offensive cyber operations with the aim of producing disruption\n— like cutting off electricity or compromising an intelligence operation by dumping\n[documents online — as well as destruction, similar to the U.S.-Israeli 2009 Stuxnet attack,](https://news.yahoo.com/revealed-how-a-secret-dutch-mole-aided-the-us-israeli-stuxnet-cyber-attack-on-iran-160026018.html)\nwhich destroyed centrifuges that Iran used to enrich uranium gas for its nuclear program.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe finding has made it easier for the CIA to damage adversaries critical infrastructure, such\nas petrochemical plants, and to engage in the kind of hack-and-dump operations that\nRussian hackers and WikiLeaks popularized, in which tranches of stolen documents or data\nare leaked to journalists or posted on the internet. It has also freed the agency to conduct\ndisruptive operations against organizations that were largely off limits previously, such as\nbanks and other financial institutions.\n\nAnother key change with the finding is it lessened the evidentiary requirements that limited\nthe CIA’s ability to conduct covert cyber operations against entities like media organizations,\ncharities, religious institutions or businesses believed to be working on behalf of adversaries’\nforeign intelligence services, as well as individuals affiliated with these organizations,\naccording to former officials.\n\n“Before, you would need years of signals and dozens of pages of intelligence to show that\nthis thing is a de facto arm of the government,” a former official told Yahoo News. Now, “as\nlong as you can show that it vaguely looks like the charity is working on behalf of that\ngovernment, then you’re good.”\n\nThe CIA has wasted no time in exercising the new freedoms won under Trump. Since the\nfinding was signed two years ago, the agency has carried out at least a dozen operations\nthat were on its wish list, according to this former official. “This has been a combination of\ndestructive things — stuff is on fire and exploding — and also public dissemination of data:\nleaking or things that look like leaking.”\n\nSome CIA officials greeted the new finding as a needed reform that allows the agency to act\nmore nimbly. “People were doing backflips in the hallways [when it was signed],” said\nanother former U.S. official.\n\nBut critics, including some former U.S. officials, see a potentially dangerous attenuation of\nintelligence oversight, which could have unintended consequences and even put people’s\nlives at risk, according to former officials.\n\nThe involvement of U.S. intelligence agencies in hack-and-dump activities also raises\nuncomfortable comparisons for some former officials. “Our government is basically turning\ninto f****ing WikiLeaks, [using] secure communications on the dark web with dissidents,\nhacking and dumping,” said one such former official.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe CIA declined to comment or respond to an extensive list of questions from Yahoo News.\nThe National Security Council did not respond to multiple written requests for comment.\n\nWhile the CIA has been pushing for years to expand its cyber authorities, Russia’s\ninterference in the 2016 election led Obama officials to grasp for new ways to retaliate\nagainst the Kremlin. High-level discussions included proposals for the CIA to dump\nembarrassing hacked information about Russian officials online, as well as to destroy\nRussian servers, according to former officials.\n\nBut just days away from launching operations in the late summer of 2016, intelligence\n[operatives were told to stand down, according to former officials. The decision to do so was](https://www.yahoo.com/news/stand-obama-team-blew-response-russian-meddling-100024634.html)\nmade at the highest levels of the Obama administration, according to a former senior\nnational security official.\n\nDuring the early days of the Trump administration, intelligence officials were hopeful that the\npresident would give the go-ahead to those operations. But senior Trump officials weren’t\ninterested in retaliating against Russia for the election interference, according to a former\nofficial. “It was radio silence,” the former official said. “It all dissipated, went to nothing.”\n\nWhile plans for immediate cyber retaliation against Russia faded, discussions about\nexpanding the CIA’s cyber authorities continued to accelerate under Trump. For years, the\nCIA had bristled under what some intelligence officials considered onerous barriers to covert\naction in cyberspace that prevented it from even proposing many operations, according to\nformer officials.\n\nWhen it came to covert action, “you always had the two camps [inside the CIA],” said Robert\nEatinger, who served at the CIA for 24 years, including a stint as the agency’s top lawyer.\nThere were “those who felt that their hands were too tied, and those who felt the restrictions\nwere wise and appropriate,” recalled Eatinger, who said he has no knowledge of the CIA\ncyber finding signed by Trump and wouldn’t discuss specific incidents that occurred during\nhis time with the agency.\n\nAdvocates for greater cyber authorities gained the upper hand in these debates under the\nTrump administration, which encouraged the CIA to stretch its prior authorities to pursue\nmore aggressive offensive cyber operations — particularly against Iran. “Trump wanted to\npush decision making to the lowest possible denominator,” said a former intelligence official.\n\n\n-----\n\nMike Pompeo made that point clear after Trump made him CIA director in January 2017.\nPompeo’s message, the former official said, was: “We don’t want to hold you up, we want to\nmove, move, move.”\n\nA current senior intelligence official, who declined to discuss specific U.S. government\noperations or policies, called Trump-era interest in offensive operations “phenomenal.” The\nCIA, the National Security Agency and the Pentagon “have been able to play like we should\nbe playing in the last couple years,” the current official said.\n\nJohn Bolton’s appointment as national security adviser in April 2018 gave another boost to\nthose seeking to ease restrictions on cyber operations. “We needed to scrap the Obama-era\nrules and replace them with a more agile, expeditious decision-making structure,” Bolton\nwrites in his recently published memoir, “The Room Where It Happened.” Part of this\ninvolved strengthening the U.S. government’s “clandestine capabilities” in cyberspace\nagainst “nonstate actors” and others, he writes.\n\nIn September 2018, Bolton announced that Trump had signed a presidential directive easing\nObama-era rules governing military cyber operations. Although the administration disclosed\nthe existence of that directive — known as National Security Presidential Memorandum 13\n— the underlying rules of engagement for military cyber operations remain secret. The\nadministration also kept secret the CIA finding, which gave the agency its new authorities.\n\nThe CIA’s new cyber powers prompted concerns among some officials. “Trump came in and\nway overcorrected,” said a former official. Covert cyber operations that in the past would\nhave been rigorously vetted through the NSC, with sometimes years-long gaps between\nformulation and execution, now go “from idea to approval in weeks,” said the former official.\n\nFormer officials declined to speak in detail about cyber operations the CIA has carried out as\na result of the finding, but they said the agency has already conducted covert hack-anddump actions aimed at both Iran and Russia.\n\nFor example, the CIA has dumped information online about an ostensibly independent\nRussian company that was “doing work for Russian intelligence services,” said a former\nofficial. While the former official declined to be more specific, BBC Russia reported in July\n2019 that hackers had breached the network of SyTech, a company that does work for the\nFSB, Russia’s domestic spy agency, and stolen about 7.5 terabytes of data; the data from\nthat hack was [passed to media organizations.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2020/03/21/putins-secret-intelligence-agency-hacked-dangerous-new-cyber-weapons-target-your-devices/#2e712396778a)\n\n\n-----\n\nIn another stunning hack-and-dump operation, an unknown group in March 2019 posted on\nthe internet chat platform Telegram the names, addresses, phone numbers and photos of\nIranian intelligence officers allegedly involved in hacking operations, as well as hacking tools\nused by Iranian intelligence operatives. That November, the details of 15 million debit cards\nfor customers of three Iranian banks linked to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps were\nalso dumped on Telegram.\n\nAlthough sources wouldn’t say if the CIA was behind those Iran breaches, the finding’s\nexpansion of CIA authorities to target financial institutions, such as an operation to leak bank\ncard data, represents a significant escalation in U.S. cyber operations. Under prior\nadministrations, senior Treasury Department officials argued successfully against leaking or\nwiping out banking data, according to former officials, because it could destabilize the global\nfinancial system. These were operations the “CIA always knew were an option, but were\nalways a bridge too far,\" said a former official. “They had been bandied about at senior levels\nfor a long time, but cooler heads had always prevailed.\"\n\nThe new cyber finding further emboldened the CIA’s operations against Iran, according to\nformer officials. Even before Trump signed the directive, administration officials were already\nencouraging the CIA to aggressively interpret preexisting secret Iran-related authorities to\nhelp prosecute the administration’s “maximum pressure” campaign against Tehran. Using the\nCold War strategy of rolling back the Soviet Union as inspiration, senior Trump national\nsecurity officials believed that destabilizing Iran within its borders would force the regime to\ncease its adventurism abroad and, perhaps, collapse.\n\nThe maximum-pressure campaign includes punishing economic sanctions, but has also\ninvolved CIA cyberattacks on Iranian infrastructure, said former officials. “It was obvious that\ndestabilization was the plan on Iran,” said one former official, and Trump administration\nofficials were eager to have the CIA conduct destructive cyber operations against targets\ninside that country. Bolton “wanted another tool, he wanted another hammer. He was looking\nat Stuxnet and how to be mean to Iran, so that was probably attractive to him,” said another\nsource.\n\nThe Trump administration was able to lean on extensive legal powers for covert action\nagainst the Islamic Republic that were already on the books, including a presidential finding\ndating back at least to the early 2000s devoted to counterproliferation — in other words,\npreventing a nuclear-armed Iran, according to former officials. Another long-standing Iran\n\n-----\n\nfocused presidential finding authorizes the CIA to counter Tehran s influence in the Middle\nEast, in particular by combating Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and by supporting\ngroups in the region opposed to the regime, according to former U.S. officials.\n\nNeither these two Iran-related findings, nor the new cyber finding, mention regime change as\na stated goal, according to former officials. Over time, however, the CIA and other national\nsecurity officials have interpreted the first two Iran findings increasingly broadly, with covert\nactivities evolving from their narrow focus on stopping Tehran’s nuclear program, they said.\nThe Iran findings have been subject to “classic mission creep,” said one former official.\n\nFatigue from having to continually beat back Iran’s nuclear progress gradually led U.S.\nofficials to take an even more aggressive approach that began to resemble a regime change\nstrategy, according to former officials. The thinking became “If we can impact the regime,\nthen no bomb,” said another former official. “We’re playing semantics — destabilization is\nfunctionally the same thing as regime change. It’s a deniability issue,” the former official said.\n\nWhile the CIA’s new powers expand the agency’s ability to target Iran and other foreign\nadversaries, they also present potential pitfalls, according to former officials. The CIA and the\nPentagon have long tussled over authorities in cyberspace, and these coordination issues\nwill only become more critical now, according to former officials — especially when U.S.\nmilitary operatives online unknowingly run up against their counterparts from the CIA.\n\n“If you’re doing something on someone’s network and you have friendly forces also on the\nnetwork, you don’t want to have fratricide,” said a former senior military intelligence official.\nEven inside the U.S. intelligence community, the CIA has a reputation for secrecy, according\nto former officials. The CIA’s “deconfliction is poor, they’re not keeping people in the loop on\nwhat their cyber operations are,” said another former official.\n\n\n-----\n\nSome former officials even worry about the oversight of cyber operations within the CIA.\nAgency cyber operatives “weren’t always transparent” about their activities, said a former\nsenior official. “It was a problem. There were times I was surprised.”\n\nThis more permissive environment may also intensify concerns about the CIA’s ability to\nsecure its hacking arsenal. In 2017, WikiLeaks published a large cache of CIA hacking tools\n[known as “Vault 7.” The leak, which a partially declassified CIA assessment called “the](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/elite-cia-unit-that-developed-hacking-tools-failed-to-secure-its-own-systems-allowing-massive-leak-an-internal-report-found/2020/06/15/502e3456-ae9d-11ea-8f56-63f38c990077_story.html)\nlargest data loss in CIA history,” was made possible by “woefully lax” security practices at the\nCIA’s top hacker unit, the assessment said.\n\nEatinger, the former top CIA attorney, who retired in 2015, said it’s unclear to him whether\nthe new cyber finding would be a return to the agency’s more freewheeling days of the\n1980s, or something that goes even further. Either way, it’s a “big deal,” he said.\n\nRemoving NSC oversight of covert operations is a significant departure from recent history,\naccording to Eatinger. “I would look at the intel community as the same as the military in that\nthere should be civilian control of big decisions — who to go to war against, who to launch an\nattack against, who to fight a particular battle,” he said. “It makes sense that you would have\nthat kind of civilian or non-intelligence civilian leadership for activities as sensitive as covert\naction.”\n\nRegardless, these expansive new cyber powers may become a lasting legacy of the Trump\nadministration, solidifying the greater role the CIA has long coveted in a key arena, and\nproviding the agency with authorities it has desired for three presidential administrations.\n\n“People thought, ‘Hey, George W. Bush will sign this,’ but he didn’t,” said a former official.\nCIA officials then believed, “‘Obama will sign it.’ Then he didn’t.”\n\n“Then Trump came in, and CIA thought he wouldn’t sign,” recalled this official. “But he did.”\n\n**_____**\n\n**Read more from Yahoo News:**\n\nAfter a Black protester is killed in Omaha, witnesses claim a rushed investigation\nignored signs of the shooter's allegedly racist past\n\n[After months of being silenced, CDC is easing back into public view](https://news.yahoo.com/after-months-of-being-silenced-the-cdc-is-easing-back-into-public-view-090053863.html)\n\nYahoo News/YouGov July 4 poll: A staggering 62 percent of Americans no longer see\nAmerica as Ronald Reagan's 'shining city on a hill'\n\n[What is voter fraud?
