Still, its infections have disrupted vital Ukrainian systems.\n\nCrowdstrike was quick to spot a weakness in the cryptographic schema of the GO-written\nstrain and offered a script to decrypt the files encrypted by HermeticRansom (aka\nPartyTicket).\n\n\"The ransomware contains implementation errors, making its encryption breakable and\nslow. This flaw suggests that the malware author was either inexperienced writing in Go or\ninvested limited efforts in testing the malware, possibly because the available development\n[time was limited,\" explains Crowdstrike in a new blog post released on Tuesday.](http://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/how-to-decrypt-the-partyticket-ransomware-targeting-ukraine/)\n\nAs BleepingComputer explained on Twitter, the HermeticRansom contains numerous\npolitically oriented string names in the ransomware binary, ransom note, and contact emails\n(vote2024forjb@protonmail com and stephanie jones2024@protonmail com)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware itself has functions/project names that appear to reference the\n403ForBiden meme:\n\n_/C_/projects/403forBiden/wHiteHousE.primaryElectionProcess\n_/C_/projects/403forBiden/wHiteHousE.GoodOffice1\nC:/projects/403forBiden/main.go\n[main.voteFor403 pic.twitter.com/gcLmHscZbl](https://t.co/gcLmHscZbl)\n\n[— BleepingComputer (@BleepinComputer) February 24, 2022](https://twitter.com/BleepinComputer/status/1496915676711329798?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nHermeticRansom was never meant to serve as a modern ransomware strain that would lay\nthe ground for double extortion, inflicting financial and reputational damage.\n\n## Still a danger\n\nThe above doesn't mean that HermeticRansom infections don't impact the targeted\nmachines.\n\nOn the contrary, this strain can still encrypt valuable files outside the Program Files and\nWindows folders, using an RSA-2048 key.\n\nThe ransom note seen by the victims has a typical form and content, asking them to contact\na ProtonMail address to acquire a decryptor.\n\n**HermeticRansom/PartyTicket ransom note**\n\n\n-----\n\n## New decryptor recovers files\n\nAlthough Crowdstrike's script is reliable, it's not easy for everyone to use it in this situation.\nTo make it easier, Avast has [released a GUI decryptor that makes it easier to decrypt files](http://decoded.avast.io/threatresearch/help-for-ukraine-free-decryptor-for-hermeticransom-ransomware/)\nencrypted by HermeticRansom.\n\nAlso, the tool offers the option to backup the encrypted files to avoid ending up with\nirreversibly corrupted files if something goes wrong with the encryption process.\n\n**Avast's graphical decryptor**\nFor a step-by-step guide on how to use the decryptor, you can [start from here.](https://decoded.avast.io/threatresearch/help-for-ukraine-free-decryptor-for-hermeticransom-ransomware/#howto)\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Free decryptor released for Yanluowang ransomware victims](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/free-decryptor-released-for-yanluowang-ransomware-victims/)\n\n[Hackers use Conti's leaked ransomware to attack Russian companies](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-use-contis-leaked-ransomware-to-attack-russian-companies/)\n\n[Clop ransomware gang is back, hits 21 victims in a single month](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/clop-ransomware-gang-is-back-hits-21-victims-in-a-single-month/)\n\n[BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware asks $5 million to unlock Austrian state](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/blackcat-alphv-ransomware-asks-5-million-to-unlock-austrian-state/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Windows 11 KB5014019 breaks Trend Micro ransomware protection](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-11-kb5014019-breaks-trend-micro-ransomware-protection/)\n\n[Decryptor](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/decryptor/)\n[HermeticRansom](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/hermeticransom/)\n[HermeticWiper](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/hermeticwiper/)\n[PartyTicket](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/partyticket/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n[Ukraine](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ukraine/)\n\n[Bill Toulas](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/bill-toulas/)\n\nBill Toulas is a technology writer and infosec news reporter with over a decade of\nexperience working on various online publications.
