    "plain_text": "# Chrome targeted by Magnitude exploit kit\n\n**blog.malwarebytes.com/exploits-and-vulnerabilities/2021/10/magnitude-ek-has-been-spotted-targeting-the-chrome-**\nbrowser/\n\nPieter Arntz October 21, 2021\n\nExploit kits (EK) are not as widespread as they used to be. One of the reasons is likely that\nmost exploit kits targeted software that is hardly ever used anymore. Internet Explorer,\nSilverlight, and Flash Player to name a few, have been deprecated, replaced, and quickly\nlost their user-base.\n\nSo, just when you start thinking there is one less threat to worry much about, researchers\nhave found an exploit kit with a keen interest in Chrome. Which, from a business point of\nview, makes a lot of sense, since Chrome is close to becoming not just a market leader, but\nalmost a monopolist in the browser market.\n\nChrome has, at the time of writing, a market share of around 65%. The only other browser\nthat reaches a market share that is over 10% is Safari. So if you are in the business of\ncompromising browsers that visit your website or watch your advertisement, having Chrome\nusers on your target list is a big plus.\n\nOr, as Malwarebytes’ Director of Threat Intelligence, Jérôme Segura, put it:\n\n“The future of exploit kits is via Chrome exploits. This could either be an anomaly or\nthe beginning of a new era with big implications for the years to come.”\n\n\n-----\n\n## Magnitude EK\n\n[Enter the Magnitude exploit kit. Researchers have found that the Magnitude EK is actively](https://twitter.com/AvastThreatLabs/status/1450476708939767815)\nusing two vulnerabilities to exploit Chromium-based browsers. Magnitude is used in\nmalvertising attacks to infect victims who visit compromised websites and its payload of\nchoice is the [Magniber ransomware.](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2018/07/magniber-ransomware-improves-expands-within-asia/)\n\n## The vulnerabilities\n\n[CVE-2021-21224 is described as a type confusion in V8 in Google Chrome prior to](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-21224)\n90.0.4430.85 which allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code inside a sandbox via\na crafted HTML page. V8 is Google’s open source high-performance JavaScript and\n[WebAssembly engine. This vulnerability was patched in April.](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2021/04/stable-channel-update-for-desktop_20.html)\n\n[CVE-2021-31956 is a Windows NTFS Elevation of Privilege (EoP) vulnerability. This](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-31956)\nvulnerability can be used in combination with CVE-2021-21224 to escape the Chromium\n[sandbox. This vulnerability was patched in June.](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2021-31956)\n\n## PuzzleMaker\n\n[Practically the same combination of vulnerabilities was described in June when Microsoft](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/exploits-and-vulnerabilities/2021/06/microsoft-fixes-seven-zero-days-including-two-puzzlemaker-targets-google-fixes-serious-android-flaw/)\nfixed seven zero-days, including the CVE-2021-131956 we mentioned earlier. Back then, the\nattacker using these vulnerabilities was dubbed PuzzleMaker. At the time it was unknown\nwhich Chrome vulnerability was used by the attacker, but it’s highly likely that it was the\nsame as Magnitude has been found leveraging now.\n\n## Payload\n\nThere is no malicious payload attached to the Magnitude exploits yet, the attack just\nexfiltrates the victim’s Windows build number. But reportedly, this is Magnitude EK’s standard\nprocedure to test out new exploits, so this could change quickly if they start to see positive\nresults.\n\n## How to protect yourself\n\nIt is only on rare occasions that we write about vulnerabilities and then tell you there isn’t\nmuch to worry about. But in this case, the only people that have anything to worry about are\nWindows users that browse the web using Chrome or Chromium based browsers (like\nEdge), but have disabled its automatic updates and haven’t updated since April. You would\nalso have to run on a non-updated Windows system since June, or run Chrome with the –no_sandbox switch (not recommended). And even then all that would happen if you ran across_\nthe Magnitude EK (which usually focuses on South Korea) is getting fingerprinted.\n\nBut you do understand that you should update your OS and browser nonetheless, right?\n\n\n-----\n\n## Enable automatic updates\n\nIf you want to save yourself the trouble of manually installing updates, there are a few things\nyou can do. For Google Chrome (under Windows) you can choose this page as one of the\ntabs that opens when you run the browser: chrome://settings/help. If there has been an\nupdate since the last time you closed your browser, this page will alert you and initiate a\ndownload of the update.\n\nIn Windows 10 you can select the Start button, then select Settings > Update & security >\n_Windows Update. Select Advanced options, and then under Choose how updates are_\n_installed, select Automatic (recommended)._\n\nStay safe, everyone!\n\n\n-----",
