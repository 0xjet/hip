These four\ninterconnected malware tools are elements of much larger mAPT (mobile advanced\npersistent threat) campaigns originating in China, and primarily targeting the Uyghur ethnic\nminority. Activity of these surveillance campaigns has been observed as far back as 2013. 1\n\nThe primary aim of these apps is to gather and exfiltrate personal user data to attackeroperated command-and-control servers. Each malware tool has its own unique data\n[gathering priorities and techniques, as detailed in our full report. Many samples of these](https://www.lookout.com/documents/threat-reports/us/lookout-uyghur-malware-tr-us.pdf)\nmalware tools were trojanized legitimate apps, i.e., the malware maintained complete\nfunctionality of the applications they were impersonating in addition to its hidden malicious\ncapabilities.\n\n\n-----\n\nLookout has found evidence that the malware predominantly targeted Uyghurs, but also, to a\nlesser extent, Tibetans. These two groups are reportedly the main focus of China’s “counterterrorism” activity. 2 Titles and in-app functionality of samples, such as “Sarkuy” (Uyghur\nmusic service), “TIBBIYJAWHAR” (Uyghur pharmaceutical app) and “Tawarim” (Uyghur ecommerce site) show that the majority of this activity focused on Uyghurs.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nThe Chinese government’s “Strike Hard Campaign against Violent Terrorism” (严厉打击暴力\n恐怖活动专项行动),which launched in mid-2014, led to the creation of the National Security\nStrategic Guidelines, the National Security Law and the Counterterrorism Law in 20153. We\nnoticed that there was a dramatic increase in the number of samples we observed after\nthese directives and initiatives were enacted.\n\n\n-----\n\n[As described in our report, the past activity of this mAPT is connected to previously reported](https://www.lookout.com/documents/threat-reports/us/lookout-uyghur-malware-tr-us.pdf)\ndesktop APT activity in China4, which is linked to GREF, a China-based threat actor also\nknown as APT15, Ke3chang, Mirage, Vixen Panda and Playful Dragon.\n\nWe noticed that campaigns by this mAPT are also active outside of China, based on the\nlanguages and services targeted by the malware samples. For example, titles such as\n“Turkey Navigation”, “A2Z Kuwait FM Radio”, ” اﺧﺒﺎر ﺳﻮرﯾﺎ” (“Syria(n) News”) may suggest\ntargets in Turkey, Kuwait and Syria respectively. Our research found that at least 14 different\ncountries may be affected by the campaigns. 12 of these are on the Chinese government’s\nofficial list of “26 Sensitive Countries,” which according to public reporting5, are used by\nauthorities as targeting criteria.\n\nThere are at least four other Android tools in the same mAPT actor’s mobile surveillance\narsenal. They are publicly known as HenBox 6, PluginPhantom 7, Spywaller 8, and\nDarthPusher 9, which have been previously observed targeting Chinese-speaking individuals\nand those of the Uyghur ethnic minority.\n\nThe surveillance apps of these campaigns were likely distributed through a combination of\ntargeted phishing and fake third-party app stores. They are not available on Google Play.\nUsers of the Lookout mobile security products are protected from these threats.\n\n1. https://citizenlab.ca/2013/04/permission-to-spy-an-analysis-of-android-malware\ntargeting-tibetans/\n[2. https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Terrorism/SR/OL_CHN_18_2019.pdf](https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Terrorism/SR/OL_CHN_18_2019.pdf)\n3. https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/Research/Chinas-Response-to-Terrorism\nCNA061616.pdf\n4. https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2014/09/forced-to-adapt-xslcmd\nbackdoor-now-on-os-x.html\n\n\n-----\n\n5. https://www.hrw.org/report/2018/09/09/eradicating-ideological-viruses/chinas\ncampaign-repression-against-xinjiangs\n[6. https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-henbox-chickens-come-home-roost/](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-henbox-chickens-come-home-roost/.xml)\n7. https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-pluginphantom-new-android-trojan-abuses\ndroidplugin-framework/\n[8. https://blog.lookout.com/spywaller-mobile-threat](https://blog.lookout.com/spywaller-mobile-threat.xml)\n[9. https://thehackernews.com/2015/03/Xiaomi-Mi-4-malware.html](https://thehackernews.com/2015/03/Xiaomi-Mi-4-malware.html.xml)\n\nLookout Threat Advisory customers are given regular updates and analyses on threat\nresearch such as this one.
