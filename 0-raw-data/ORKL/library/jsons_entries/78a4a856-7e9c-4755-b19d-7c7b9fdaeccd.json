In late June\n2022, this evolution resulted in campaigns utilizing what Proofpoint informally calls MultiPersona Impersonation (MPI), a subset of Impersonation noted in Proofpoint's Email Fraud\nTaxonomy framework. In MPI, TA453 takes their targeted social engineering to a new level,\ntargeting researchers with not just one actor-controlled persona but multiple. This technique\n[allows TA453 to leverage the psychology principle of social proof to prey upon its targets and](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/mind-brain-and-technology/202005/why-were-all-followers)\n\n\n-----\n\nincrease the authenticity of the threat actor s spear phishing. Proofpoint has previously\nobserved this technique from advanced business email compromise actors such as TA2520\n(Cosmic Lynx).\n\nIt is important to note that for the purposes of this blog, Proofpoint refers to each of the\nTA453 personas by the sender name. While Proofpoint has previously observed TA453 using\ncompromised email accounts to send phishing emails, Proofpoint has no specific indication\nthat these spoofed individuals were victimized by TA453. Additionally, Proofpoint regularly\nsees TA453 pair the same spoofed person with different actor-controlled email addresses.\n\n## Typical TA453 Activity\n\nIn what Proofpoint researchers consider a standard TA453 campaign, the threat actor\n[masquerades as an individual, such as a journalist or policy adjacent individual, working to](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/above-fold-and-your-inbox-tracing-state-aligned-activity-targeting-journalists)\ncollaborate with the intended target. Historically, TA453 has targeted academics,\npolicymakers, diplomats, journalists, and human rights workers. Benign conversations that\neventually lead credential harvesting links are hallmarks of TA453 activity. Proofpoint has\nobserved limited instances of TA453 deploying malware.\n\nIn almost all cases, TA453 would engage in one-to-one conversations with their targets but\nthis changed in mid-2022.\n\n## Times are Changing: TA453's Multiple Personalities\n\nProofpoint researchers observed a shift in TA453's approach starting in June 2022. In this\nfirst campaign (Figure 1), TA453 started the conversation masquerading as \"Aaron Stein,\nDirector of Research at FRPI.\" The actor included a variety of questions intended to generate\na dialogue about Israel, the Gulf States, and the Abraham Accords. While these questions\nare generally meant to establish a pretext for sending a follow-up credential harvesting link or\nto deliver a malicious document, it is also possible they represent intelligence questions\ntasked to TA453.\n\nIn the email, TA453's \"Aaron Stein\" launched the threat actor's use of Multi-Persona\nImpersonation (MPI) by referring to and including a \"Richard Wike, director of global attitudes\nresearch at PEW Research Center\" on the CC line.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1. TA453 email posing as an \"Aaron Stein, Director of Research at FRPI.\"_\n\nA day after the initial email, \"Richard Wike\" responded (Figure 2) to the email thread likely in\nan attempt to establish the veracity of the request and solicit a response from the target. In\nthis case, no malicious documents or links were observed.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2. TA453 follow-up email using another persona._\n\n**Bringing Up BadBlood: In late June 2022, TA453 reached out to a target specializing in**\ngenome research as \"Harald Ott\" and cc'd two other actor-controlled accounts, \"Claire Parry,\nAssistant Director at the Centre for Universal Health in Chatham House's Global Health\nProgramme\" and \"Dr. Andrew Marshall, chief editor of Nature Biotechnology,\" which made\nthis impersonation attempt a three to one MPI using organ regeneration as a lure. When the\ntarget replied to the initial email, \"Harald\" delivered a OneDrive link that downloaded a\nmalicious Word doc named Ott-Lab 371.docx. The SHA256 for the file is\nf6456454be8cb77858d24147b1529890cd06d314aed70c07fc0b5725ac84542b. Proofpoint\nassesses this document represents the latest iteration of TA453's exploitation of Remote\n[Template Injection previously reported by PwC. The template and its macros,](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/cybersecurity/cyber-threat-intelligence/old-cat-new-tricks.html)\ndubbed Korg by Proofpoint, will be discussed later in this report.\n\n_Figure 3. Screenshot of TA453 using one of its cc'd personas to further the ruse targeting a_\n_medical researcher._\n\nWhile the targeting of medical personnel, specifically those involved in genome research, is\nnot a frequent area of focus for TA453, it is not the first time this actor has demonstrated an\ninterest in this type of research. In December 2020, TA453 conducted a phishing campaign\n[targeting medical researchers, as detailed in Proofpoint's BadBlood blog.](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/badblood-ta453-targets-us-and-israeli-medical-research-personnel-credential)\n\n**Group Project: In June 2022, TA453's \"Carroll Doherty\" persona reached out to a prominent**\nacademic involved in nuclear arms control about a possible US versus Russia clash. This\ncampaign ended up representing an evolution of TA453's MPI technique as the persona did\n\n\n-----\n\nnot stop at reaching out to just one target but reached out to two targets at the same\nuniversity. \"Carroll\" also cc'd three other TA453 personas on the email: \"Daniel Krcmaric,\"\n\"Aaron Stein,\" and \"Sharan Grewal.\"\n\n_Figure 4. Timeline of TA453's Group Project email campaign._\n\nOne of the targets responded initially to the outreach email but then ghosted \"Carroll.\" After\nthe target failed to respond for a little over a week, \"Carroll\" kindly provided a OneDrive link\nto the article referenced in the original email (Figure 5). The link downloaded a document\ntitled “The possible US-Russia clash.docx\" SHA256:\n16a961475a88313478bc2406d6b442be9809e64ea9e2a4754debcce9200cf36b.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5. Screenshots of \"Carroll\" persona sending the target a malicious OneDrive link and_\n_password._\n\n\"Carroll\" sent the password separately and followed up with the target to let them know the\ndocument is secure because it cannot be read without the password. Four days later, one of\nthe cc'd TA453 personas, \"Aaron Stein,\" dropped \"Carroll\" from the email thread, apologized\nto the target, and resent the same OneDrive link and password (Figure 6).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6. A cc'd TA453 persona attempting to convince a target of the legitimacy of the_\n_campaign._\n\nSimilar to the document sent by \"Harald,\" this document also used remote template injection\nto download Korg.\n\n## Korg—TA453's Latest Remote Template Injection\n\nAs noted above, some of TA453's campaigns delivered OneDrive links that hosted malicious\ndocuments. The documents are the latest version of the TA453 remote template injection\ndocuments [discussed by PwC in July 2022. The password protected documents downloaded](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/cybersecurity/cyber-threat-intelligence/old-cat-new-tricks.html)\nthe macro enabled template documents from 354pstw4a5f8.filecloudonline[.]com. Proofpoint\nobserved multiple campaigns reusing that specific filecloudonline[.]com host. The\ndownloaded template, dubbed Korg by Proofpoint, has three macros: Module1.bas,\nModule2.bas, and ThisDocument.cls. The macros collect information such as username, list\nof running processes along with the user's public IP from my-ip.io and then exfiltrates that\ninformation using the Telegram API.\n\nAt this time, Proofpoint has only observed the beaconing information and has not observed\nany follow-on exploitation capabilities. The lack of code execution or command and control\ncapabilities within the TA453 macros is abnormal. Proofpoint judges that infected users may\nbe subject to additional exploitation based on the software identified on their machines.\n\n## Attribution\n\nProofpoint continues to assess that TA453 operates in support of the Islamic Revolutionary\nGuard Corps (IRGC). This assessment is based on a variety of evidence, including overlaps\n[in unit numbering between Charming Kitten reports and IRGC units as identified by PwC,](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/cybersecurity/cyber-threat-intelligence/old-cat-new-tricks.html#insights)\nthe [US Department of Justice indictment of Monica Witt and IRGC-affiliated actors, and](https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1131726/download)\n[analysis of TA453 targeting compared to reported IRGC-IO priorities.](https://www.terrorism-info.org.il/en/the-intelligence-organization-of-the-irgc-a-major-iranian-intelligence-apparatus/)\n\n\n-----\n\nProofpoint tracks multiple subgroups of TA453 differentiated primarily by victimology,\ntechniques, and infrastructure. Some subgroups in their typical campaigns will engage in\nbenign conversations with targets for weeks before delivering malicious links. Conversely,\nanother subgroup tends to immediately send a malicious link in the initial email.\n\nWhile the mere presence of specific indicators does not definitively condemn an email as\nTA453, indicators of a possible TA453-linked persona include:\n\nUse of Gmail, Outlook, Hotmail, or AOL email address instead of institutional email\nIncluding other \"personal email accounts\" in the conversation\nReplying to blank email\nAsking to collaborate on research about issues relating to the Middle East\nOffering a Zoom call (often resulting in a credential harvesting link)\nSending unsolicited collaboration \"draft\" attachments\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAll threat actors are in constant states of iterating their tools, tactics, and techniques (TTPs),\nadvancing some while deprecating others. The use of MPI by TA453, while the group's latest\ntechnique, is likely to continue to evolve and morph as this group hunts for intelligence in\nsupport of the IRGC. Proofpoint researchers have already started to observe this potential\nnext step with TA453 attempting to send a blank email, then respond to the blank email all\nwhile including all their \"friends\" on the CC line. This is likely the threat actor's attempt at\nbypassing security detection.\n\nResearchers involved in international security, particularly those specializing in Middle\nEastern studies or nuclear security, should maintain a heightened sense of awareness when\nreceiving unsolicited emails.For example, experts that are approached by journalists should\ncheck the journalist’s or their publication’s website to see if the email address belongs to\nthem.\n\n[Previous Blog Post](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/chasing-currents-espionage-south-china-sea)\nSubscribe to the Proofpoint Blog\n\n\n-----",
