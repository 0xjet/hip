SCANdalous—a.k.a. Scannah Montana a.k.a. Scanny\nMcScanface a.k.a. “Scan I Kick It? (Yes You Scan)”—had another name before today that,\nfor legal reasons, we’re keeping to ourselves. A special thanks to our legal team who is\nalways looking out for us, this blog post would be a lot less fun without them. Strap in folks.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nAdvanced Practices is known for using primary source data obtained through Mandiant\nIncident Response, [Managed Defense, and product telemetry across thousands of FireEye](https://www.fireeye.com/resources/the-forrester-wave-managed-detection-and-response-q1-2021)\nclients. Regular, first-hand observations of threat actors afford us opportunities to learn\nintimate details of their modus operandi. While our visibility from organic data is vast, we also\nderive value from third-party data sources. By looking outwards, we extend our visibility\nbeyond our clients’ environments and shorten the time it takes to detect adversaries in the\nwild—often before they initiate intrusions against our clients.\n\n[In October 2019, Aaron Stephens gave his “Scan’t Touch This” talk at the annual FireEye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1tEOkY-7JE)\n[Cyber Defense Summit (slides available on his Github). He discussed using network scan](https://github.com/aaronst/talks/blob/master/scanttouchthis.pdf)\ndata for external detection and provided examples of how to profile command and control\n(C2) servers for various post-exploitation frameworks used by criminal and intelligence\norganizations alike. However, manual application of those techniques doesn’t scale. It may\nwork if your role focuses on one or two groups, but Advanced Practices’ scope is much\nbroader. We needed a solution that would enable us to track thousands of groups, malware\nfamilies and profiles. In this blog post we’d like to talk about that journey, highlight some\nwins, and for the first time publicly, introduce the project behind it all: SCANdalous.\n\n**Pre-SCANdalous Case Studies**\n\nPrior to any sort of system or automation, our team used traditional profiling methodologies\nto manually identify servers of interest. The following are some examples. The success we\nfound in these case studies served as the primary motivation for SCANdalous.\n\n_APT39 SSH Tunneling_\n\nAfter observing APT39 in a series of intrusions, we determined they frequently created\n[Secure Shell (SSH) tunnels with PuTTY Link to forward Remote Desktop Protocol](https://www.fireeye.com/resources/bypassing-network-restrictions-through-rdp-tunneling)\nconnections to internal hosts within the target environment. Additionally, they preferred using\nBitVise SSH servers listening on port 443. Finally, they were using servers hosted by\nWorldStream B.V.\n\nIndependent isolation of any one of these characteristics would produce a lot of unrelated\nservers; however, the aggregation of characteristics provided a strong signal for newly\nestablished infrastructure of interest. We used this established profile and others to illuminate\n[dozens of servers we later attributed to APT39, often before they were used against a target.](https://www.fireeye.com/resources/apt39-iranian-cyber-espionage-group-focused-on-personal-information)\n\n\n-----\n\n_APT34 QUADAGENT_\n\nIn February 2018, an independent researcher shared a sample of what would later be named\nQUADAGENT. We had not observed it in an intrusion yet; however, by analyzing the\ncharacteristics of the C2, we were able to develop a strong profile of the servers to track over\ntime. For example, our team identified the server 185.161.208\\.37 and domain rdppath\\.com\nwithin hours of it being established. A week later, we identified a QUADAGENT dropper with\nthe previously identified C2. Additional examples of QUADAGENT are depicted in Figure 1.\n\n\nQUADAGENT C2 servers in the Shodan user interface\n\n\nFigure 1: QUADAGENT C2 servers in the Shodan user interface\nFive days after the QUADAGENT dropper was identified, Mandiant was engaged by a victim\nthat was targeted via the same C2. This activity was later attributed to APT34. During the\ninvestigation, Mandiant uncovered APT34 using RULER.HOMEPAGE. This was the first time\nour consultants observed the tool and technique used in the wild by a real threat actor. Our\n\n\n-----\n\nteam developed a profile of servers hosting HOMEPAGE payloads and began tracking their\ndeployment in the wild. Figure 2 shows a timeline of QUADAGENT C2 servers discovered\nbetween February and November of 2018.\n\n\nTimeline of QUADAGENT C2 servers discovered throughout 2018\n\n\nFigure 2: Timeline of QUADAGENT C2 servers discovered throughout 2018\n_APT33 RULER.HOMEPAGE, POSHC2, and POWERTON_\n\nA month after that aforementioned intrusion, Managed Defense discovered a threat actor\nusing RULER.HOMEPAGE to download and execute POSHC2. All the RULER.HOMEPAGE\nservers were previously identified due to our efforts. Our team developed a profile for\nPOSHC2 and began tracking their deployment in the wild. The threat actor pivoted to a novel\nPowerShell backdoor, POWERTON. Our team repeated our workflow and began illuminating\nthose C2 servers as well. This activity was later attributed to APT33 and was documented in\nour [OVERRULED post.](https://www.fireeye.com/resources/overruled-containing-a-potentially-destructive-adversary)\n\n\n-----\n\n**SCANdalous**\n\n_Scanner, Better, Faster, Stronger_\n\nOur use of scan data was proving wildly successful, and we wanted to use more of it, but we\nneeded to innovate. How could we leverage this dataset and methodology to track not one or\ntwo, but dozens of active groups that we observe across our solutions and services? Even if\nevery member of Advanced Practices was dedicated to external detection, we would still not\nhave enough time or resources to keep up with the amount of manual work required. But\nthat’s the key word: Manual. Our workflow consumed hours of individual analyst actions, and\nwe had to change that. This was the beginning of SCANdalous: An automated system for\nexternal detection using third-party network scan data.\n\nA couple of nice things about computers: They’re great at multitasking, and they don’t forget.\nThe tasks that were taking us hours to do—if we had time, and if we remembered to do them\nevery day—were now taking SCANdalous minutes if not seconds. This not only afforded us\nadditional time for analysis, it gave us the capability to expand our scope. Now we not only\nlook for specific groups, we also search for common malware, tools and frameworks in\ngeneral. We deploy weak signals (or broad signatures) for software that isn’t inherently bad,\nbut is often used by threat actors.\n\nOur external detection was further improved by automating additional collection tasks,\nexecuted by SCANdalous upon a discovery—we call them follow-on actions. For example, if\nan interesting open directory is identified, acquire certain files. These actions ensure the\nteam never misses an opportunity during “non-working hours.” If SCANdalous finds\nsomething interesting on a weekend or holiday, we know it will perform the time-sensitive\ntasks against the server and in defense of our clients.\n\nThe data we collect not only helps us track things we aren’t seeing at our clients, it allows us\nto provide timely and historical context to our incident responders and security analysts.\nTaking observations from Mandiant Incident Response or Managed Defense and distilling\nthem into knowledge we can carry forward has always been our bread and butter. Now, with\nSCANdalous in the mix, we can project that knowledge out onto the Internet as a whole.\n\n_Collection Metrics_\n\nLooking back on where we started with our manual efforts, we’re pleased to see how far this\nproject has come, and is perhaps best illustrated by examining the numbers. Today (and as\nwe write these continue to grow), SCANdalous holds over five thousand signatures across\nmultiple sources, covering dozens of named malware families and threat groups. Since its\ninception, SCANdalous has produced over two million hits. Every single one of those, a\npiece of contextualized data that helps our team make analytical decisions. Of course, raw\nvolume isn’t everything, so let’s dive a little deeper.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen an analyst discovers that an IP address has been used by an adversary against a\nnamed organization, they denote that usage in our knowledge store. While the time at which\nthis observation occurs does not always correlate with when it was used in an intrusion,\nknowing when we became aware of that use is still valuable. We can cross-reference these\ntimes with data from SCANdalous to help us understand the impact of our external detection.\n\nLooking at the IP addresses marked by an analyst as observed at a client in the last year, we\nfind that 21.7% (more than one in five) were also found by SCANdalous. Of that fifth,\nSCANdalous has an average lead time of 47 days. If we only consider the IP addresses that\nSCANdalous found first, the average lead time jumps to 106 days. Going even deeper and\nexamining this data month-to-month, we find a steady upward trend in the percentage of IP\naddresses identified by SCANdalous before being observed at a client (Figure 3).\n\nPercentage of IP addresses found by SCANdalous before being marked as\nobserved at a client by a FireEye analyst\n\n\nFigure 3: Percentage of IP addresses found by SCANdalous before being marked as\nobserved at a client by a FireEye analyst\n\n\n-----\n\nA similar pattern can be seen for SCANdalous average lead time over the same data (Figure\n4).\n\n\nAverage lead time in days for SCANdalous over the same data shown in Figure 3\n\n\nFigure 4: Average lead time in days for SCANdalous over the same data shown in Figure 3\nAs we continue to create signatures and increase our external detection efforts, we can see\nfrom these numbers that the effectiveness and value of the resulting data grow as well.\n\n**SCANdalous Case Studies**\n\nToday in Advanced Practices, SCANdalous is a core element of our external detection work.\nIt has provided us with a new lens through which we can observe threat activity on a scale\nand scope beyond our organic data, and enriches our workflows in support of Mandiant.\nHere are a few of our favorite examples:\n\n_FIN6_\n\n\n-----\n\nIn early 2019, SCANdalous identified a Cobalt Strike C2 server that we were able to\nassociate with FIN6. Four hours later, the server was used to target a Managed Defense\nclient, as discussed in our blog post, Pick-Six: Intercepting a FIN6 Intrusion, an Actor\nRecently Tied to Ryuk and LockerGoga Ransomware.\n\n_FIN7_\n\nIn late 2019, SCANdalous identified a BOOSTWRITE C2 server and automatically acquired\nkeying material that was later used to decrypt files found in a FIN7 intrusion worked by\nMandiant consultants, as discussed in our blog post, Mahalo FIN7: Responding to the\nCriminal Operators’ New Tools and Techniques.\n\n_UNC1878 (financially motivated)_\n\n[Some of you may also remember our recent blog post on UNC1878. It serves as a great](https://www.fireeye.com/resources/the-cycle-of-adversary-pursuit)\ncase study for how we grow an initial observation into a larger set of data, and then use that\nknowledge to find more activity across our offerings. Much of the early work that went into\ntracking that activity (see the section titled “Expansion”) happened via SCANdalous. The\nquick response from Managed Defense gave us just enough information to build a profile of\nthe C2 and let our automated system take it from there. Over the next couple months,\nSCANdalous identified numerous servers matching UNC1878’s profile. This allowed us to\nnot only analyze and attribute new network infrastructure, it also helped us observe when\nand how they were changing their operations over time.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThere are hundreds more stories to tell, but the point is the same. When we find value in an\nanalytical workflow, we ask ourselves how we can do it better and faster. The automation we\nbuild into our tools allows us to not only accomplish more of the work we were doing\nmanually, it enables us to work on things we never could before. Of course, the conversion\ndoesn’t happen all at once. Like all good things, we made a lot of incremental improvements\nover time to get where we are today, and we’re still finding ways to make more. Continuing to\ninnovate is how we keep moving forward – as Advanced Practices, as FireEye, and as an\nindustry.\n\n**Example Signatures**\n\nThe following are example Shodan queries; however, any source of scan data can be used.\n\n**Used to Identify APT39 C2 Servers**\n\nproduct:“bitvise” port:“443” org:“WorldStream B.V.”\n\n**Used to Identify QUADAGENT C2 Servers**\n\n“PHP/7.2.0beta2”\n\n\n-----\n\n**RULER.HOMEPAGE Payloads**\n\nhtml:“clsid:0006F063-0000-0000-C000-000000000046”\n\n\n-----",
