Our research team has been tracking this threat for many months in order to understand its intrinsic details. In\nthis paper, we focus in particular on the command-and-control (C&C) design of the AZORult malware – we discuss our fi ndings\nrelated to the C&C design and some security issues that we have identifi ed.\n\nThe research:\n\n - Unveils the design of C&C operations, specifi cally the design of the C&C panels.\n\n - Uncovers inherent security vulnerabilities in the AZORult C&C panels that will help us to collect advanced intelligence\nregarding the attacker-controlled portals.\n\n - Provides intelligence that can be used in security products to generate advanced analytics and to detect malicious\ncommunication with the C&C panels.\n\n### BACKGROUND\n\nAZORult has been widely used to steal sensitive information from infected systems, the stolen information subsequently being\nused for nefarious purposes. A number of research teams have already presented their analyses of the malicious nature of the\nbinary installed on the end-user systems, detailing the techniques and tactics used by the malware itself. Some of the previous\nresearch work includes:\n\n - The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) [1] released an analysis of AZORult malware characteristics and\nhow the malware has been used in attacks that scam end-users by spreading fake messages related to COVID-19.\n\n  - _Kaspersky [2] highlighted how the AZORult malware campaign has been used to target end-users to steal VPN credentials._\n\n  - _Trend Micro [3] has also presented an analysis of the working nature of AZORult malware._\n\n  - _Palo Alto Networks [4] highlighted the use of earlier versions of AZORult malware in collaboration with the Fallout_\nexploit kit.\n\n### UNDERSTANDING THE DESIGN OF THE AZORULT C&C PANEL\n\nIn this section, we will dig deeper into the design of the AZORult C&C panel and elaborate on the most important functions and\nfeatures of the C&C panel. If you are interested in understanding the advanced architecture of C&C panels, please refer to the\nresearch related to SpyEye [5] and our empirical analysis [6] of HTTP-based C&C panels.\n\n**AZORult C&C web panel layout**\n\nLet’s fi rst take a look at how the C&C panel of AZORult looks when deployed on a server and exposed to the Internet. Figure 1\nshows the AZORult C&C panel. The web panel is very basic in its design and uses a simple HTML web form functionality.\n\nLooking at the panel and admin.php fi le, the web panel simply prompts a basic HTML web form and asks for a password.\nNo username HTML form fi eld is available as the C&C panel only requires the password to authenticate the user. There is no\nprotection against brute-force attacks in the form of a CAPTCHA either.\n\n\n-----\n\nVIRUS BULLETIN  www.virusbulletin.com\n\n**AZORult C&C panel components**\n\n\n_Figure 1: AZORult live C&C panel._\n\n\nIn Table 1, we take a look at the different components of the C&C panel.\n\n**Component** **Description**\n\nadmin.php This component confi gures the settings of the C&C panel including error handling, authentication,\nauthorization, database confi guration, and others.\n\nindex.php The main landing page of the C&C panel from where access is granted to the botnet operator.\n\nconfi g.json A component that defi nes confi guration settings that the bot uses to communicate with the C&C panel. The\nconfi guration settings are embedded directly into the binary (exe or dll) and the same binary is distributed to be\ninstalled on the infected end-user systems.\n\nfunctions.php Supporting functions such as error_reporting, base64Decrypt, traffi c_decrypt, etc. are defi ned in this\ncomponent.\n\nguest.php A component that provides restricted access, i.e. guest or anonymous, to the specifi c functionality of the C&C\npanel capabilities.\n\nmaxmind.php A component that allows the C&C to use geolocation databases to map bot IP addresses to locations across the\nInternet.\n\nbin.bin A binary component which is encrypted and encoded in nature and generated for specifi c functionality to\ntrigger additional infections on the infected end-user system.\n\ndump.sql A basic component that allows bulk dumping of SQL data by running specifi c SQL queries.\n\n_Table 1: AZORult C&C panel components._\n\n|Component|Description|\n|---|---|\n|admin.php|This component confi gures the settings of the C&C panel including error handling, authentication, authorization, database confi guration, and others.|\n|index.php|The main landing page of the C&C panel from where access is granted to the botnet operator.|\n|confi g.json|A component that defi nes confi guration settings that the bot uses to communicate with the C&C panel.

The code is presented\nbelow:\n\nfunction Auth(){\n\nif (@$_POST['auth']==\"1\"){\n\nsleep(\n\n2);\n\nif (@$_POST['password']==ADMIN_PWD)\n\n{\n\nheader('Set-cookie: pwd='.md5($_POST['password'].$_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'].\"\").'; httpOnly' );\n\nheader(\"Location: \".$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']);\n\n};\n\n};\n\n};\n\nAuth();\n\nif((@$_COOKIE[\"pwd\"]) != md5(ADMIN_PWD.$_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'].\"\")) die(FileToString('./html/login.html'));\n\nMain(); ?>\n\nIf you look at the code above, you will notice that the HTTP POST request is processed and the parameter ‘password’ is checked\nagainst the known administrative password (ADMIN_PWD). If the supplied password matches the admin password, the ‘Set-Cookie’\nheader is generated with the required values to set up the session. The ‘Set-Cookie’ header contains the ‘pwd’ parameter, which\ncontains the MD5 hash of the password concatenated with the user-agent string supplied by the client (browser). The ‘Set-Cookie’\nheader is transmitted back to the browser and the session is authenticated. If the MD5 hash value is tampered with, the session is\nkilled. The important point to note here is that the MD5 hash actually contains the admin password of the portal.\n\n**CSRF token generation**\n\nLet’s look at how the AZORult C&C panel generates CSRF tokens for protecting against cross-site application attacks. The code\nbelow presents how the CSRF token is created:\n\n$CSRF_TOKEN = md5(\"yukd894as98d4v\".md5(ADMIN_PWD.$_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'].\"\"));\n\nIf you scan the code above, you will notice that the CSRF token is an MD5 hash of the hard-coded string ‘yukd894as98d4v’\nappended with the MD5 hash of the session token. This shows that the CSRF token is a hash of the combination of a pre-populated\nrandom string and a session token.\n\n**Stolen password data storage and retrieval in C&C panel**\n\nIn this section, we will look into the type of data stored in the C&C panel database. The data here refers to the credentials and\nsensitive information stolen from the infected end-user systems running the AZORult bot.\n\n\n-----\n\nVIRUS BULLETIN  www.virusbulletin.com\n\nThe ‘p_soft_type’ parameter in the code refers to the different types of client software that are susceptible to infection and\nextraction of credentials by the AZORult bot. These include browsers, FTP clients, mail clients, and instant messaging (IM)\nclients. You can cross-check this information in the leaked ‘confi g.json’ fi le as part of the information disclosure vulnerability\ndiscussed later. Figure 2, taken from the AZORult C&C panel, shows how the information extracted using ‘p_soft_type’ parameters\nis shown in the form of reports, i.e. password type stats.\n\n_Figure 2: Exposed password type stats._\n\nFurther, the code below highlights how the C&C panel manages and stores the stolen passwords collected from infected systems.\nThis information is extracted from the database and displayed in a structured format in the C&C panel so that the AZORult\noperator can analyse and use the information.\n\nfunction ShowPasswordsPage(){\n\nforeach ($_GET as $value) {\n\nif (is_array($value)) die(); }\n\n$link = mysqli_connect(DB_HOST, DB_USER, DB_PASS, DB_NAME);\n\n$query=\"SELECT passwords.p_soft_name,\n\npasswords.p_p1,\n\npasswords.p_p2,\n\npasswords.p_p3,\n\npasswords.r_id\n\nFROM passwords, reports\n\nWHERE reports.r_id=passwords.r_id AND passwords.p_soft_name<>''\";\n\nif(isset($_GET['search'])\n\nif(strlen($_GET['search'])>0)\n\n$query .= \" AND LOCATE('\".mysqli_real_escape_string($link, $_GET['search']).\"', concat_ws('|', passwords.p_\nsoft_name, passwords.p_p1, passwords.p_p2,passwords.p_p3,passwords.r_id))\";\n\n-- Truncated -\nif(isset($_GET['soft_type1'])) {if ($_GET['soft_type1']==\"1\") $query .=\" \";}\n\nelse $query .=\" AND passwords.p_soft_type<>1\";\n\nif(isset($_GET['soft_type2'])) {if ($_GET['soft_type2']==\"1\") $query .=\" \";}\n\nelse $query .=\" AND passwords.p_soft_type<>2\";\n\nif(isset($_GET['soft_type3'])) {if ($_GET['soft_type3']==\"1\") $query .=\" \";}\n\nelse $query .=\" AND passwords.p_soft_type<>3\";\n\nif(isset($_GET['soft_type4'])) {if ($_GET['soft_type4']==\"1\") $query .=\" \";}\n\nelse $query .=\" AND passwords.p_soft_type<>4\";\n\nif(isset($_GET['r_id'])) {if (($_GET['r_id']<>\"\") and (is_numeric($_GET['r_id']))) $query .=\" AND\n\npasswords.r_id=\".mysqli_real_escape_string($link, $_GET['r_id']);};\n\nif(isset($_GET['inc_il'])) if ($_GET['inc_il']==\"1\")\n\n{\n\n$query .= \" AND ( \";\n\n\n-----\n\nVIRUS BULLETIN  www.virusbulletin.com\n\n$links = explode(\"\\r\\n\", FileToString(\"./links.txt\"));\n\nforeach ($links as $key => $value) {\n\n//echo $value;\n\n$query .= \"(passwords.p_p1 LIKE '\".mysqli_real_escape_string($link, $value).\"') OR\";\n\n}\n\n$query = substr($query,0,-2};\n\n$query .= \" ) \";} $query .=\" ORDER BY passwords.p_soft_type, passwords.p_soft_name\";\n\n--- Truncated -\nThe code above reveals exactly how the AZORult C&C panel runs different database SQL queries to dump the stolen passwords\nin the form of reports to be consumed by the AZORult operator. Let’s look into some of the information disclosure vulnerabilities\nthat we discovered during the course of this research.\n\n### AZORULT C&C PANEL VULNERABILITIES\n\nIn this section, a number of AZORult C&C panel security vulnerabilities are presented that leak information about the panel and\nits inherent confi guration.\n\n**Unrestricted access to confi guration fi le**\n\nAZORult has a built-in security confi guration issue that allows end-users to access the confi guration fi le on the fl y. This means\nthat any end-user can access this fi le in an unauthenticated manner. The fi le is named ‘confi g.json’ by default. The confi guration of\nbroad privileges allows any anonymous user to access this fi le. Figure 3 highlights the exposed confi guration of the C&C panel.\n\n_Figure 3: Accessing the confi guration fi le in an unauthenticated manner._\n\nIt is important to decode the output present in the confi guration fi le presented below.\n\n{\n\n\"isDouble\": true,\n\n\"isSavedPasswords\": true,\n\n\"isBrowserData\": true,\n\n\"isBrowserHistory\": true,\n\n\"isWallets\": true,\n\n\"isSkype\": false,\n\n\"isTelegram\": false,\n\n\"isSteam\": false,\n\n\"isScreenshot\": true,\n\n\"isDelete\": false,\n\n\"fi les\": {\n\n\"0\": {\n\n\n-----\n\nVIRUS BULLETIN  www.virusbulletin.com\n\n\"fgName\": \"MQ==\",\n\n\"fgPath\": \"JVVTRVJQUk9GSUxFJVxEZXNrdG9wXA==\",\n\n\"fgMask\": \"Ki50eHQsKi5kb2MqLCoueGxzKg==\",\n\n\"fgMaxsize\": \"MzA=\",\n\n\"fgSubfolders\": true,\n\n\"fgShortcuts\": false,\n\n\"fgExceptions\": \"\"\n\n},\n\n\"1\": {\n\n\"fgName\": \"Mg==\",\n\n\"fgPath\": \"JVVTRVJQUk9GSUxFJVxEb2N1bWVudHNc\",\n\n\"fgMask\": \"Ki50eHQsKi5kb2MqLCoueGxzKg==\",\n\n\"fgMaxsize\": \"MzA=\",\n\n\"fgSubfolders\": true,\n\n\"fgShortcuts\": false,\n\n\"fgExceptions\": \"\"\n\n}\n\n},\n\n\"loader\": {}\n\nLet’s decode the values fi rst to understand more about the confi guration parameters.

With this\ninformation, extensive intelligence can be built without reversing the AZORult binary. Additionally, a number of IoCs can be\ngenerated to detect the presence of AZORult malware in the system and further eradicate infections accordingly.\n\n**Guest and anonymous access allows traffi c stats**\n\nAnother interesting security issue that has been identifi ed is the exposure of a successful infection stats web page to\nunauthenticated users. Figure 4 highlights one such example of the real-world AZORult C&C panel.\n\n_Figure 4: Infection stats fi le can be viewed by guests._\n\n|Confi guration parameter|Encoded value if any|Decoded value|Details|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|fgName|MQ==|1|Potentially used to defi ne the fi le name and numbering|\n|fgPath|JVVTRVJQUk9GSUxFJVxEZXNrdG9wXA==|%USERPROFILE%\\ Desktop\\|Directory path on the end-user system where the fi le is stored|\n|fgMask|Ki50eHQsKi5kb2MqlCoueGxzKg==|*.txt, *.doc**.xls*|File types supported for writing data and processing|\n|fgMaxsize|MzA==|30|Defi nes the size of the fi le|\n|fgSubfolders|true|true|Interacts with subfolders on the end-user system.|\n|fgShortcuts|false|false|Supporting fi le shortcuts|\n|fgExceptions|\"\"|null|Handling and reporting any exceptions|\n\n\n-----\n\nVIRUS BULLETIN  www.virusbulletin.com\n\nFrom an intelligence point of view this information is crucial because it reveals how many bots are connecting back to the\ndeployed C&C panel and includes information such as types of browsers compromised, binary types, country stats, infected\noperating systems, and more. This information helps threat researchers and threat responders determine the risk level associated\nwith this C&C panel and actions that need to be taken to minimize the impact.\n\n**I nformation disclosure via default PHP pages**\n\nOne of the other information security issues that exists in the deployment of C&C panels is the presence of default PHP pages in\nthe same web directory as that in which C&C web components are hosted. This is not a security issue of the C&C panel itself,\nbut a side effect of the deployment in which additional software packages such as PHP, MySQL, etc. are required to run the C&C\npanel. Figure 5 shows an example of an exposed PHP web page discovered on the AZORult C&C deployment.\n\n_Figure 5: Exposed PHPInfo web pages hosted in the C&C panel web directory._\n\nThe default PHP info web page reveals information about the underlying architecture that is running AZORult C&C panels. The\ninformation includes but is not limited to:\n\n - The confi gured PHP version.\n\n - Installed operating system and its version.\n\n - Signifi cant details of the PHP confi guration.\n\n - Information about the internal IP addresses.\n\n - Details about the server environment variables.\n\n - Installed and loaded PHP extensions and their confi gurations.\n\nThe above information helps gain an understanding of the architecture and installed software that is used to deploy C&C panels.\n\n### GE NERATING THREAT INTELLIGENCE\n\nUsing an offensive approach to threat research can help to build threat intelligence as discussed below:\n\n - Vulnerabilities in C&C panels reveal the weaknesses that exist in the server-side software used by the botnet (malware)\noperators to command and control the malicious code running on compromised systems.\n\n\n-----\n\nVIRUS BULLETIN  www.virusbulletin.com\n\n - Information from C&C panels can help to build indicators of compromise (IoCs). For example, the malicious code residing\non the compromised systems connects back to C&C panels. Knowing the server-side information about the C&C panel, we\ncan scan and dissect the network traffi c to detect potential infections. Another example is that the leaking of information\nabout compromised systems on the Internet helps us to identify how many active infections are running, including the type of\noperating systems, target browsers, etc.\n\n - Understanding the design of C&C internals helps us to gain intelligence on how the information (credentials, client\ninformation, etc.) stolen from the end-user systems is stored and managed by the botnet operators. In fact, most important is\nwhere exactly the stolen information is stored in the database on the C&C infrastructure.\n\n - Intelligence gained from the C&C panels can be used to feed back into security solutions in order to detect and prevent\nmalware infections on the fl y in an automated manner.\n\n - The intelligence can also be used to build 360 degree threat profi les, conducting threat analytics and empirical analysis for\ncorrelating other sets of threats in order to understand the threat landscape better.\n\n - Intelligence can also be used to build security features to conduct data science (DS) and machine learning (ML) experiments\nfor detecting potential anomalies related to specifi c threats.\n\nOverall, in order to combat advanced threats, an offence-to-defence (OTD) approach to research is the need of the hour.\n\n### CO NCLUSION\n\nIn this paper we discussed the C&C panel design of AZORult malware including a number of information disclosure\nvulnerabilities that result from insecure authentication mechanisms in place. The information leakage via the C&C panel reveals\na lot of signifi cant intelligence about the AZORult threat. Potential fl aws in C&C infrastructure owned by the malware operators\npresent useful threat intelligence to defend against ongoing active threats in the wild.\n\n### REFERENCES\n\n[1] AZORult Malware.
