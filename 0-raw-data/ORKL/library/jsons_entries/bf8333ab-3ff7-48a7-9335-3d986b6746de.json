Things that will give me insights into\nhow users act as they go about their daily activities. Having done this for a while now I can\nsay that people typically like routines as they go about their work, but how they go about their\nwork is largely dictated by their job role. Examples may be the developer that often creates\narchive files or the sales person that authenticates from multiple locations per day.\n\nOperating under the assumption that people will generally look the same from day to day it\nwould make sense to understand why someone may deviate from their normal routine,\nespecially from a security context. One way we can do this is to measure their own, unique\nbehavior and apply some anomaly detection to highlight days of interest.\n\nFor the example I'm going to show, I wanted to focus on insider from a data theft standpoint,\nbut this method can be applied to many different scenarios as long as you can define the\npoints of interest to observe. The hypothesis that I'm using for insider data theft is:\n\n1. Users who knowingly steal data will often use deceptive actions.\n\n2. They will perform actions that are new or rare for them.\n\n3. They will use uncommon exfiltration paths.\n\n4. Rare actions across multiple phases can be identified.\n\nThe phases (categories) I'm using here are Deception, data staging and exfiltration.\n\nBelow I'm pasting screenshots of the relevant portion of the Jupyter notebook I'm using. The\ncool thing about using Jupyter is it's independent of the log source. I can use this as long as\nthe data can be exported or accessed via api. Code blocks below are commented to\ndescribe the function.\n\nBelow is an example rule from an external rule file.\n\n\n-----\n\nBelow would be the output from the anomaly detection.\n\nThe fields that are being measured are:\n\nRule_1 - Rule_6: Detection rules from rules file\nArchive_Count: The number of archives created by day\nMail_Count: The number by day of emails sent to a personal email provider with an\nattachment\nRename_Count: The number of files renamed in a day\nNTU_Count: The number of files uploaded to an external source in a day\nWeighted: The sum by day of additional values given to rule detections\nDay_Count: The total count of all events by day\n\nThis method won't tell you 100% that anomaly is malicious. But you may be able to infer\nwhat the user was doing and the likely hood of needing further investigation. An example\nmay be 2 archive events + 2 email events may result in 2 zip files being emailed to a\npersonal email address. That may or may not need investigating depending on the users\nrole.\n\n\n-----",
