The group has added new malware tools to its arsenal.\n\n[Another attack campaign that we had discovered in March 2021 (ref. blog), seems to be part](https://www.seqrite.com/blog/new-spear-phishing-campaign-using-army-welfare-education-societys-scholarship-form/)\nof the more extensive SideCopy campaign. The spear-phishing attack campaign used the\nArmy Welfare Education Society’s scholarship form as a lure.\n\nThe second wave of SideCopy uses COVID-19 as a lure, which is not unique since, in the last\nyear & a half, the COVID-19 theme has been used in numerous cyber-attacks. However, this\nis the first time that the COVID-19 theme is being used in the SideCopy campaign.\n\nIn most cases, successful execution of the attack would result in deploying a Remote\nAdministration Tool. If a RAT gets installed, the attackers will get unrestricted access to the\nmachine and steal sensitive data from these agencies.\n\n\nAdministration Tool. If a RAT gets installed, the attackers will get unrestricted access to the\nmachine and steal sensitive data from these agencies.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### TECHNICAL ANALYSIS\n\nEmail with C&C\nmalicious Server\nattachments\n\n\nRAR/ZIP\nArchive\n\n\nCustom\nC#\nImplant\n\n\n###### Vector-1 : LNK payload\n\n\nExecution\n\nLNK File HTA\nExtension File\nSpoofed\n\nDownload and open\nDecoy File\n\n_(Vector-1: Execution Chain)_\n\n_(Initial Intrusion via LNK file)_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe initial intrusion chain begins with a spear-phishing email that attempts to lure users\ninto extracting the attached zip archive. Upon extraction, the user would see a document\nfile that is an extension spoofed LNK file. If the user opens the document, the LNK payload\ngets launched and initiates the malicious activities in the background. To ensure the user is\nnot suspicious, a decoy document is presented to the user.\n\n###### HTA Payload\n\n_(660427971b04313c2ebf2410f9ba4f67c5f1d8ecc472be6c709546a12dc97f7d)_\n\nOnce the LNK file is launched, it downloads the HTA payload from a compromised domain\nand executes it via mshta.exe. This HTA file is responsible for showing the decoy document\nto the user. In addition, it drops an executable of ReverseRAT on disc and executes it.\n\n###### Custom C# Implant - ReverseRAT\n\nThe APT group carefully chooses their targets, upgrades tools in their arsenal based on the\ntargets, and mainly uses limited but effective functionality in being evasive.\n\nMost of the backdoors used in the campaign are NJRat; however, in one specific case, we\ncame across a new payload written in C#, which installs an implant enabling attacker to\nexamine the target and install other backdoors. This implant appears to be an advanced\n[version of the implant that we analyzed in our previous write-up.](https://www.seqrite.com/blog/new-spear-phishing-campaign-using-army-welfare-education-societys-scholarship-form/)\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Stage-1:\n\n_(solaris.exe - 864dc421ddda3032938a5f1753ebc4d24c6250cd201204c4024012fe2b8a460a)_\n\nWe noticed attackers are using a custom payload to drop the final implant, encrypted with\nTriple-DES in ECB mode, on disc with persistence via AutoRun registry key.\n\n###### Stage2:\n\n_(inithost.exe - ee2cc931d5b4bad780abb0e5cee7d9bb51916035e4cce0e8239fe0a444ed523d)_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe stage 2 is an implant with some extra features which work on\nthe attacker’s command. This includes the following:\n\n**No.** **Features** **Command**\n\n1 Download And Execute DW\n\n2 Update The Working Binary UPDATE\n\n3 Self-Kill CLOSE\n\n4 Capture Screenshots RD+ and RD\n###### Stage 2 features in detail\n\nThis implant has additional features as compared to the previous version. This continuous\nenhancement of the attack tools shows that the attack group is active and is developing\ntools to target potential victims better.\n\n###### Feature - Download and Execute\n\n_(Stage 2: Download and Execute)_\n\nThe download and execute routines are different from the previous version. The code has\nbeen made simpler and smaller than before. The base64 encoded staged binary is fetched\nfrom C2 and decoded and saved on disc in folder “wininets” before execution.\n\n|No. 1|Features Download And Execute|Command DW|\n|---|---|---|\n|2|Update The Working Binary|UPDATE|\n|3|Self-Kill|CLOSE|\n|4|Capture Screenshots|RD+ and RD-|\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Feature - Update the working binary\n\n\n_(Stage 2: Update Binary)_\n\n\nThe implant updates itself on commands issued by C2. The update mechanism is simple:\n\n- The implant fetches the updated version\n\n- Writes it to the current working directory with the name “jingo.exe.”\n\n- Stops the current process of working binary\n\n- Closes sockets\n\n- Starts a newly updated binary while killing itself\n\n###### Feature - Self-Kill\n\n\n_(Stage 2: Self-Kill)_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe implant can kill itself if the target is not of interest to the attacker. The command\npushed from C2 “CLOSE” is meant to kill the connection. It, however, does not clear all the\nartifacts of persistence, so the attacker regains connection once the system is rebooted.\n\n###### Feature - Capture Screenshots\n\n\n_(Stage 2: Screenshot Capture)_\n\n\nReverseRAT can capture screenshots on the victim’s machine. Method “Capture” accepts\ntwo parameters as integers - dimension width and height of the JPEG - provided by C2 in\ncommand. Once the function completes its job, it encrypts the image with AES with ECB\nmode and sends it back to C2.\n\n###### Vector - 2: NJRAT - Lure Names with Extension Spoofing\n\nC&C Server\n\n\nEmail with\nmalicious\nattachments\n\n\nSFX file inside Zip Archive SFX file : Phase-3 of winhosti.exe\n\nNationwide Covid-19\nVaccination Registration.pdf.exe\n\n_(Vector 2: Execution Chain)_\n\n\n-----\n\n_(NJRAT Configuration)_\n\n\nThrough telemetry, we noticed NJRat connecting to “149.248.52.61”. Further analysis\nshowed that the RAT came via a zip file containing an SFX archive, which dropped a\nVBScript. This VBScript launched the C# variant of NJRAT connecting to the host mentioned\nabove on port 87. After doing further research, we noticed that it's a code reused from\nGitHub.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### ATTRIBUTION\n\n##### 1. MachineID\n\nSince releasing our previous [report](https://www.seqrite.com/resources/operation-sidecopy) on Operation SideCopy in September 2020, we have\nbeen monitoring the activities of this attack group. We noticed that the group kept using the\nsame machine to create most of their payloads:\n\n_(A sample from campaign in 2020)_\n\n_(Sample used in this campaign)_\n\nThe above images show that the attacker used the same machine (with ID\n“desktop-g1i8n3f”) to create these LNK files. This clearly points to the current attack also\nbeing part of the SideCopy campaign.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### 2.  The ReverseRAT payload connects to Ips hosted on CONTABO. Transparent Tribe,\nthe group believed to be behind Operation SideCopy, uses CONTABO to host pay\nloads or serve as C&C.\n\n##### 3.  In a previous investigation, we observed that most hosts used in the SideCopy\ncampaign resolve to subdomains having “VMI” and “VDM” strings at the beginning.\nThe same is the case in this attack as well.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### 4.  The whois information from the hosts indicate that the attack mentioned in our\n[previous blog (ref. blog) related to spear-phishing campaign using Army Welfare](https://www.seqrite.com/blog/new-spear-phishing-campaign-using-army-welfare-education-societys-scholarship-form/)\nEducation Society’s scholarship form is part of the same group.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### EXPANSION IN OPERATIONS\n\nSideCopy seems to be expanding its campaign to other countries as well. During our\nanalysis, we came across a sample that appears to have come from a USA-based entity.\n\n\n_(65ae52ac448a011701c4f077449112329b79f23f758524dd753dfe757c52f508 - abc.hta)_\n\n\nThis sample is also generated from the same machine (machine with ID “desktop-g1i8n3f”).\nUpon execution, it launches an HTA payload and opens a decoy document.\n\n\n-----\n\n_(Document opened once all stages are executed-_\n_7751776f35e5eae53c4d6a3e5bc216f8cc3bcdafa856b6dd6b1c18f982615448_\n\n\nThe payload connects back to IP address “149.248.52.61”, which is the same as the other\nidentified samples.\n\nThe EXIF data of the decoy file shows that it was created on 2020-08-25T04:01:00Z. This\nindicates that actors are using this host for at least the second half of 2020.\n\n[Ref: https://www.cenjows.in/upload_images/pdf/E-Scan-01-15-Aug-2020.pdf](https://www.cenjows.in/upload_images/pdf/E-Scan-01-15-Aug-2020.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\n#### FINDING THE REAL ATTACKER\n\nBased on our telemetry intelligence and data from VirusTotal, we determined that the\nattackers were leveraging compromised websites that targeted organizations would\ngenerally access. This shows that attackers did detailed reconnaissance before launching\nthe campaign.\n\nBy data analysis, we came across the type of individuals that the campaign is targeting. In\naddition, we also identified types of websites that are being used to host attack artifacts &\nserve as Command & Control servers. This gave us a pivot, and we landed on two\ncompromised websites where C2s were active and accessible.\n\n\n_(PHP script serving payloads to targeted victims based on the User-Agent)_\n\n\nBy analyzing accessible artifacts from these compromised websites, we uncovered that the\nthreat actor is managing the campaign through a PHP script. Attackers use phishing emails\nto lure targeted individuals to these websites, where the PHP script serves the malicious\npayload based on user-agent info. In this example, Windows users are targeted. If the\nuser-agent includes the string “Windows NT 10” or “Windows NT 6.3”, the actual payload is\nserved. Otherwise, the decoy payload is done.\n\n\n#### FINDING THE REAL ATTACKER\n\n\n-----\n\nAlong with that, visitor logs are also saved in a text file. Over time, attackers may serve\ndifferent payloads via the same PHP script for repeated visitors. This shows the level of\nsophistication of this campaign.\n\n\n_(Sample Victim Data Logs)_\n\n\nEach campaign is monitored, and victim attributes are maintained in text and CSV files:\n\n1. IP Address\n\n2. Timestamp at which the payload was served\n\n3. User-Agent info\n\n\n-----\n\nHere is an example of the type of lure being used in phishing mails.\n\nWe identified the following IP addresses through further data analysis, pointing to entities\nin Telecom, Power, and Finance sectors as potential targets. This is likely a subset of targets,\nthough, as we suspect that several other government entities are being targeted in this\ncampaign.\n\n\n**1.** **223.31.174.169**\n\n\n**2.** **164.100.43.40**\n\n\n**3.** **120.57.112.139**\n\n\n**4.** **120.57.112.246**\n\n\n**5.** **59.97.128.246**\n\n\n**6.** **117.201.89.40**\n\n\n**7.** **120.56.119.125**\n\n\n**8.** **117.197.175.43**\n\n\n**9.** **106.215.252.198**\n\n\n-----\n\n#### HANDLER ATTRIBUTION - CONNECTING THE DOTS\n\nDuring the data analysis from C2 servers, we found a specific IP in almost all the logs. In fact,\nin both the C2 servers that we analyzed, this particular IP was the first entry. We believe this\nIP belongs to the test machine from which attackers validate whether their setup works\nfine.\n\n_(IP found as first entry in logs on C2 servers)_\n\nAnalyzing publicly available information on IP address 182.191.210.191 tells us that IP is\nlocated in Pakistan and is provided by PTCL (Pakistan Telecommunications Company Ltd.)\n\n\n-----\n\n#### CONCLUSION\n\nTransparent Tribe attack group has been linked with Pakistan in the past as well. The\nevidence presented in this paper goes on to strengthen that claim even further.\n\nIn the current campaign, SideCopy/Transparent Tribe is once again targeting critical\ngovernment entities in India. The attack tools & methods have also been enhanced to make\ndetection difficult. This shows that this attack group is well funded and actively improves\nattack mechanisms to infiltrate the target entities.\n\nWe advise our customers to be aware of such attacks, set up necessary cybersecurity\ncontrols, follow good cybersecurity practices, train their employees on cyber risks, and keep\nmonitoring their environment for anything suspicious.\n\n|MITRE ATT&CK MATRIX|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|Sphere Phishing: LNK payload|T1204.002|\n|Hosted HTA file Execution via mshta.exe|T1218.005|\n|Command And Control|TA0011|\n|AES encrypted communication|T1573.001|\n|Information Collection of Infected Host|T1082|\n|Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder|T1547.001|\n|njRAT|S0385|\n\n\n-----\n\n#### TABLE FOR IoCs\n\n|SFX: 84609f9e443225a23cca8ab6be910c207d220bb430fd543d0724eaae8f7df592|director_general_level_border_coord ination_conference.pdf.exe|\n|---|---|\n|1afb690159f041ce4f0af3618ebd1cef4597d3d94bd249c4644b8e359f46199d|Indian Army Restructring And Re-Organization.pdf.exe|\n|f17fd9ff93d1b3db6c3e4463d5ca5c11b99827890c58721d2860df75d4323705|Phase-3 of Nationwide Covid-19 Vaccination Registration.pdf.exe|\n|c79ab21cf7fc23b9a096c4d9aa5b7cd02d968b8dfc58b137c2df44b1e55307b6|Kavach-Release-win.exe|\n|d5a109f147a4c051b993026dd24fa97f9eeacd26e3ec5595ade2316de733b712|4f1c460608a80b82094bf9c87f31e03 2.virus|\n|5aa238299b3d28da0cf4a46fce5ed6cf34db72c554f030fa03be3aea567336ac|Covid-Instr-2-21-DGMO-61.jpg .exe.bin|\n|LNK: 7f800784b00354dd15eee129317a63bd3f7bb25622e898c873603e5b142cbb09|Covid Vaccination On Emergency Basis for All Employees and their Familes.pdf.lnk|\n|df47ca45bdf2f910a0ebae49d29549240066f77d0abb735cf1afe41368cb0d85|Cir-Bfg-Int-May21-Summary.docx.lnk|\n|24469a7f1f33cdecf507824a773814b5f3190c81acaf04d06c168ccbf71b2ee8|Covid Vaccination.pdf.lnk|\n|54759951089f44a3918e164b8bf29c8f388cfd41f9930f81b8103852947fed93|Call-for-Proposal-DGSP-COAS-Chair- Excellance.pdf.lnk|\n|8a10797ac7f84d09cfb4cb3a6a1e75473dc81dab757c0000036a861575216e5c|DATE-OF-NEXT-INCREMENT-ON-UP -GRADATION-OF-PAY-ON-01-JAN-A ND-01-JUL.pdf.lnk|\n|ee58d8ecc5dce13f4eee1e6164654f82a5eb339dc3c6e023b69ea7d6df5b930f|Posting (AllTypes), Promotions, and Other Record Wing Matters.pdf.lnk|\n|e16153ee38bc971c4fd94f4d35996d0ef41a33bb53d5028170da48712904a3e7|ETPBs Speed_Post_Booking.pdf.lnk|\n|91cbd850c6ac25ad762eb256ab432c45af78737cb3fb042f6fd8b3ece9a96dfb||\n|HTA : a00813028306c519829ca3b2f16357124aa77b998c9c6cc6f16c00c24503eace|shell.php|\n|660427971b04313c2ebf2410f9ba4f67c5f1d8ecc472be6c709546a12dc97f7d|course.hta|\n|65ae52ac448a011701c4f077449112329b79f23f758524dd753dfe757c52f508|abc.hta|\n|f927d3aec7a84b45d8b6e4f871cf4d4c462143079b31f7d07214754cfb04cb0a|style7.css.hta|\n|df173424d830588307eb70c50c5811cac66d8daf03f53d610cc0129ba5d30167|hta.10|\n|46e2595644f26bea7b6ad5b332ab04ee93cedb603717696ff82494f5217bdb97|hta.7|\n\n\n-----\n\n#### TABLE FOR IoCs\n\n|ReverseRAT Implant Dropper: 864dc421ddda3032938a5f1753ebc4d24c6250cd201204c4024012fe2b8a460a|solaris.exe|\n|---|---|\n|259e0acea693e80af641925c2f881842e8aa979d770cc34a1769065028dd9d74|solaris.exe|\n|31564bd50713e63a6d4cb749048f7908b5f7629d2ef950b7240f85d734a32ceb|system.exe|\n|205a59ac9ca1e976a5923d79051d887694c2156c253ec204f96d7385eca35284|Ivew.exe|\n|ReverseRAT Implant: ee2cc931d5b4bad780abb0e5cee7d9bb51916035e4cce0e8239fe0a444ed523d|solaris1.exe|\n|b7ce2df21b8a9e8cba08e86700f435d42937b07d2103d9191767737de67ea82b|sigma.exe|\n|74d708dd367a18c2555f1e82b739b188e7d9722c28fef139eddd3d55abdc23b5|Def.exe|\n|96d87548a3b4cdc83dcd1e13e093a50c60073c74ee4a3bf4ed94689efc044974|slug.exe|\n|NJRat 0.7d: a8768e632a5c8fbb7c7b201f1e6df6362ed48d77efa74c62eaa900e0e73eebee|wintask.exe|\n|5d52f58a75bbe7519bbcae8333e91b5dbcc8459bb23bb01d077d5c51954c0ef8|wintask.exe|\n|8e3f04d34dfb35e685f6785c406ab5ffdad15ba376c8ac584bf25c7a7b3b547a|winwnet.exe|\n|1dab360111d8a0f59674bc5c725b88edac598dd7e0171ab7c3bc5416d45e6e89|winhosti.exe|\n|eb688e9d721c561fe334147c66679bbd988da10c06704a15f048b97a9f6b0f7f Domains: 5-135-125-106.cinfuserver[.]com|winonet.exe|\n|ikiranastore[.]com||\n|londonkids[.]in||\n|iiieyehealth[.]com||\n|imenucard[.]com||\n|Rarebooksocietyofindia[.]org||\n|Vedicwisdom[.]in||\n|vmi281634.contaboserver.net||\n|vmi433658.contaboserver.net IP: 164.68.104.126||\n|178.79.161.146||\n|149.248.52.61||\n|182.73.189.238||\n|5.135.125.106 DLLs: 6cae885bcdd3139fd87c65ea817daa4b586cfd257a8127d8af3422b99e61f123|hta.dll|\n\n\n-----",
