We call this technique “tainted leaks.”\n\nThe operation against the journalist led us to the discovery of a larger phishing\noperation, with over 200 unique targets spanning 39 countries (including members of 28\ngovernments). The list includes a former Russian Prime Minister, members of cabinets\nfrom Europe and Eurasia, ambassadors, high ranking military officers, CEOs of energy\ncompanies, and members of civil society.\n\nAfter government targets, the second largest set (21%) are members of civil society\nincluding academics, activists, journalists, and representatives of non-governmental\norganizations.\n\nWe have no conclusive evidence that links these operations to a particular Russian\ngovernment agency; however, there is clear overlap between our evidence and that\npresented by numerous industry and government reports concerning Russian-affiliated\nthreat actors.\n\n## Summary\n\nThis report describes an extensive Russia-linked phishing and disinformation campaign. It\nprovides evidence of how documents stolen from a prominent journalist and critic of Russia\nwas tampered with and then “leaked” to achieve specific propaganda aims. We name this\ntechnique “tainted leaks.” The report illustrates how the twin strategies of phishing and tainted\nleaks are sometimes used in combination to infiltrate civil society targets, and to seed mistrust\nand disinformation. It also illustrates how domestic considerations, specifically concerns about\nregime security, can motivate espionage operations, particularly those targeting civil society.\nThe report is organized into four parts described below:\n\n\n-----\n\nagainst David Satter, a high-profile journalist. We demonstrate how material obtained during\nthis campaign was selectively released with falsifications to achieve propaganda aims. We\nthen highlight a similar case stemming from an operation against an international grantmaking\nfoundation, headquartered in the United States, in which their internal documents were\nselectively released with modifications to achieve a disinformation end. These “tainted leaks”\nwere demonstrated by comparing original documents and emails with what Russia-linked\ngroups later published. We conclude that the tainting likely has roots in Russian domestic\npolicy concerns, particularly around offsetting and discrediting what are perceived as “outside”\nor “foreign” attempts to destabilize or undermine the Putin regime.\n\n**[PART 2: A TINY DISCOVERY describes how the operation against Satter led us to the](https://citizenlab.ca/2017/05/tainted-leaks-disinformation-phish/#part2)**\ndiscovery of a larger phishing operation, with over 200 unique targets. We identified these\ntargets by investigating links created by the operators using the Tiny.cc link shortening service.\nAfter highlighting the similarities between this campaign and those documented by previous\nresearch, we round out the picture on Russia-linked operations by showing how related\ncampaigns that attracted recent media attention for operations during the 2016 United States\npresidential election also targeted journalists, opposition groups, and civil society.\n\n**[PART 3: CONNECTIONS TO PUBLICLY REPORTED OPERATIONS outlines the](https://citizenlab.ca/2017/05/tainted-leaks-disinformation-phish/#part3)**\nconnections between the campaigns we have documented and previous public reporting on\nRussia-linked operations. After describing overlaps among various technical indicators, we\ndiscuss the nuance and challenges surrounding attribution in relation to operations with a\nRussian nexus.\n\n**[PART 4: DISCUSSION explores how phishing operations combined with tainted leaks were](https://citizenlab.ca/2017/05/tainted-leaks-disinformation-phish/#part4)**\npaired to monitor, seed disinformation, and erode trust within civil society. We discuss the\nimplications of leak tainting and highlight how it poses unique and difficult threats to civil\nsociety. We then address the often-overlooked civil society component of nation-state cyber\nespionage operations.\n\n## Introduction: Tainted Leaks & Civil Society Targets\n\nRussia-linked cyber espionage campaigns, particularly those involving targeting around the\n2016 U.S. elections, and more recently the 2017 French election, have dominated the media in\nrecent months. As serious as these events are, often overlooked in both media and industry\nreports on cyber espionage is a critical and persistent victim group: global civil society.\n\nA healthy, fully-functioning, and vibrant civil society is the antithesis of non-democratic rule,\nand as a consequence, powerful elites threatened by their actions routinely direct their\npowerful spying apparatuses toward civil society to infiltrate, anticipate, and even neutralize\ntheir activities. Unlike industry and government, however, civil society groups typically lack\nresources, institutional depth, and capacity to deal with these assaults. For different reasons,\nthey also rarely factor into threat industry reporting or government policy around cyber\n\n\n-----\n\nepidemic” of targeted digital attacks on civil society, in this case involving widely reported\nRussian-affiliated cyber espionage operations. Our report underscores the domestic roots of\nthese foreign operations, and how concerns over regime security and domestic legitimacy can\nfactor into Russian threat modeling and espionage targeting, both at home and abroad.\n\n### Patient Zero for the Investigation: David Satter\n\nOur investigation began with a single victim: David Satter, a high-profile journalist, Rhodes\nScholar, and critic of the Kremlin. In 2013, Satter was banned from Russia, allegedly for\n[“flagrant violations” of visa laws, but which most attribute to his investigative reporting on](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/13/russia-expels-american-journalist-david-satter)\n[Russian autocracy. Satter is known for his book, Darkness at Dawn, which investigated the](https://www.amazon.ca/Darkness-Dawn-Russian-Criminal-State/dp/0300105916)\npossible 1999 conspiracy involving the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) in a series of\nbombings of Russian apartment buildings that was used as a justification for the second\nChechen War and which facilitated the rise to power of Vladimir Putin.\n\nOn October 7, 2016 Satter fell victim to a targeted phishing campaign, and mistakenly entered\nhis password on a credential harvesting site. Satter’s e-mails were stolen and later published\nselectively, and with intentional falsifications, as we will describe in this report. While we cannot\nconclusively attribute the theft of Satter’s emails to one particular threat actor, nor do we have\nconcrete details on the process by which his stolen emails were falsified and made their way\ninto the public domain, we uncover and analyze several pieces of evidence to help\ncontextualize the tainted leaks, while at the same time linking the infiltration of his email to a\nmuch wider cyber espionage campaign that has a Russian nexus.\n\n### Tainted Leaks: Disinformation 2.0\n\nFollowing the compromise of his account, Satter’s stolen e-mails were selectively modified,\nand then “leaked” on the blog of CyberBerkut, a self-described pro-Russian hacktivist group.\nThis report introduces the term “tainted leaks” to describe the deliberate seeding of false\ninformation within a larger set of authentically stolen data.\n\nWe examine in detail how a report sent to the National Endowment for Democracy (NED)\nabout Radio Liberty’s Russian investigative reporting project (contained in the emails stolen\nfrom Satter) was carefully modified with false information prior to being released. We show\nhow this manipulation created the false appearance that prominent Russian anti-corruption\nfigures, including Alexei Navalny, were receiving foreign funding for their activities. (Alexei\nNavalny is a well-known Russian anti-corruption activist and opposition figure). We also note\nhow the document was used in an effort to discredit specific reports about corruption among\nclose associates of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nIn addition, whoever tainted the document also made reference to an article that had not yet\nbeen published at the time the document was “leaked.” This timing strongly suggests advance\nknowledge of the publication of an upcoming piece of investigative journalism concerning\n\n\n-----\n\nand would not have been widely known. This may suggest that the operators had access to\nother, ongoing surveillance operations.\n\nOnce the tainted leak was released, Russian state-owned media and others reported that the\n[document showed a CIA-backed conspiracy to start a “colour revolution” in Russia.1](https://citizenlab.ca/2017/05/tainted-leaks-disinformation-phish/#1) The\ntainted leak was also reported as evidence that the reports on corruption within Putin’s inner\ncircle represented part of a deliberate disinformation campaign on behalf of foreign interests.\n\n[The timing and substance of the tainting coincides with reported fears among Putin and his](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/27/world/europe/in-protests-kremlin-fears-a-young-generation-stirring.html)\nclose associates that revelations about their wealth and its sources could trigger protests and\nuprisings within Russia, like those lead by Navalny in recent months and years.\n\nTainted leaks pose complex challenges to the victims of breaches, as well as representing a\n[potent and troubling method of disinformation. Part 1 describes the leak tainting in greater](https://citizenlab.ca/2017/05/tainted-leaks-disinformation-phish/#part1)\ndetail, and **[Part 4: Discussion provides an analysis of the risks posed by the tactic.](https://citizenlab.ca/2017/05/tainted-leaks-disinformation-phish/#part4)**\n\n### Pandora’s Un-Shortening: High Value Targets Emerge\n\n\nWhile investigating the suspicious messages sent to Satter, we determined that Tiny.cc, the\nlink-shortening service used by the operators to phish credentials, had predictable features\nthat enabled us to discover some other links likely used by the same operators. We developed\na technique to discover some of these links, and ultimately collected 223 malicious links\n[representing 218 unique targets.2](https://citizenlab.ca/2017/05/tainted-leaks-disinformation-phish/#2) We have been able to identify the real identity of\napproximately 85% of the targets. Of the set we identified, we found targets from at least 39\ncountries.\n\nOne thread that links the targets is that their professional activities connect them to issues\nwhere the Russian government has a demonstrated interest. In some cases, the targets are\nRussians, ranging from an ex-Prime Minister, to journalists who investigate corruption, to\npolitical activists. Many more targets are from, posted to, or involved in extractive industries in\ncountries and areas where the Russian government has an economic and strategic interest,\nsuch as former Soviet states. Still others are likely to be working on issues on the other side\nof the negotiating table from Russia, whether as part of United Nations operations, NATO, or\ncivil service. Perhaps unsurprisingly, one of the largest groups of targets are high-ranking\nmilitary and government personnel and elected officials in Ukraine.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1: Map showing countries that targets of the phishing campaign are linked to [click\nfor hi-res]\n\nIn other cases, for instance, the wife of a military attache, individuals appear to be targeted\nbecause of their proximity to high value targets. In others, we have identified a large number of\nindividuals who appear to be targeted because they received support, in the form of a\nfellowship, from a particular US-based grantmaker.\n\nSome notable target categories include:\n\nPoliticians, public servants and government officials from Afghanistan, Armenia, Austria,\nCambodia, Egypt, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Peru, Russia, Slovakia,\nSlovenia, Sudan, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, Uzbekistan and Vietnam\nDiplomatic personnel from numerous embassies, up to and including ambassador level,\nas well as their family members\nCivil society members including very high profile critics of the Russian president, as well\nas journalists and academics\nSenior members of the oil, gas, mining, and finance industries of the former Soviet states\nUnited Nations officials\nMilitary personnel from Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Greece, Latvia,\nMontenegro, Mozambique, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Sweden, Turkey, Ukraine, and the\nUnited States, as well as NATO officials\n\n\n-----\n\n[structure, and objectives (Part 2 outlines how we discovered the targets). After government](https://citizenlab.ca/2017/05/tainted-leaks-disinformation-phish/#part2)\ntargets, the second largest set (21%) are members of civil society like academics, activists,\njournalists, and representatives of non-governmental organizations.\n\nFigure 2: Some high-value targets\nwho received phishing emails\n\n#### The Importance of Civil Society Targets\n\nThe data presented in Figure 3 underscore the extent to which civil society groups are being\ntargeted in numbers equivalent to those seen with the more classic ‘cyber espionage’ sectoraligned targets such as military, government, and industry.\n\nAmongst the civil society targets, more than half were journalists, many of whom are\nprominent contributors to Russian language news outlets such as Vedomosti, Slon/Republic,\nNovaya Gazeta, and the BBC Russian Service.\n\nWhile providing a detailed analysis of the civil society targets or an outline of their areas of\nactivity would undoubtedly jeopardize their privacy, we can safely reflect on two notable\npatterns that emerge from such an analysis.\n\n\n-----\n\nknown for their public efforts towards shining a light on the Russian government and its\nactivities. From publishing articles that outline fraud or corruption, to general activism in\nsupport of electoral reform, many of the civil society targets seem to have been singled out for\nthe perception that their actions could pose a threat to the Putin regime.\n\n**Figure 3: Breakdown of discovered targets into broad categories**\n\nAnother notable commonality found during analysis of the civil society targets of these\ncampaigns is the near perfect alignment between their areas of activity and the geopolitical\nconflicts in which Russia is a known or suspected belligerent, or party to the conflict.\nSpecifically, the focus areas of the civil society targets span geographic boundaries, including\nconflict areas such as Syria, Afghanistan, Ukraine, and others.\n\nWe also found that several dozen of the targeted individuals had as a thread in common that\nthey had received a fellowship from a single funder focused on the region.\n\n### Notification\n\nThe large and diverse target group presented notification challenges. Our process for notifying\npotential victims involved the following considerations and steps:\n\nFor targets affiliated with governments or government-affiliated organizations (such as\nNATO or the United Nations), or businesses in a particular country, we passed\ninformation on targets’ names and email addresses to the relevant Computer Emergency\nResponse Team (CERT)\nIf many targets shared an organizational affiliation, but not a single employer, we\n\n\n-----\n\n## Part 1: How Tainted Leaks Are Made\n\n_We examine how stolen materials from Satter’s inbox were turned into tainted leaks and_\n_released by CyberBerkut, and then examine a similar operation against the Open Society_\n_Foundations._\n\nTo make a clean comparison between real and fake, and illustrate exactly how tainting takes\nplace, we obtained original, genuine documents and e-mails from David Satter, a victim of a\nbreach, and compared them with the tainted versions. We then describe a prior case of tainted\nleaks: internal documents belonging to the Open Society Foundations were stolen, then later\n[released with tainting similar to Satter’s, also by CyberBerkut.3](https://citizenlab.ca/2017/05/tainted-leaks-disinformation-phish/#3)\n\nIn both cases the breach victims were working with US-based organizations which had\nprograms specializing in Russia. The tainting appeared to have two objectives: cause the\nprograms to appear more subversive of Russia than they were, and discredit specific\nopposition individuals and groups critical of Russian President Putin and his confidants.\n\n### The Case of David Satter\n\nOn October 5, 2016, a phishing email was sent to the Gmail address of David Satter (See:\n**[Patient Zero: David Satter). This phishing email was crafted with a specific ruse designed to](https://citizenlab.ca/2017/05/tainted-leaks-disinformation-phish/#patientzero)**\nlook like a security warning from Google, suggesting to the recipient that an unknown thirdparty has obtained their Gmail account password (see Figure 4).\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 4: Phishing Email 1, mimicking a genuine message from Google**\n\nThe phishing email is designed to trick the recipient into clicking on the ‘Change Password’\nbutton. Clicking on this link would direct the victim’s web browser to a link hosted on the URL\n[shortening service Tiny.cc. The operator disguised the link by using an open redirect hosted by](https://sites.google.com/site/bughunteruniversity/best-reports/openredirectsthatmatter)\nGoogle. This open redirect allowed the operators to create a URL that, superficially, appears to\nbe hosted by Google:\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/tiny.cc/(redacted)\n\nUnfortunately, the ultimate destination of this shortened URL was changed to a benign\nwebpage before we were able to examine this phishing email. However, as we will outline in\n**[Part 2 of this report, there is sufficient evidence available to suggest the original destination.](https://citizenlab.ca/2017/05/tainted-leaks-disinformation-phish/#part2)**\n\nAnalysis of the email headers revealed that the message was sent with the Russian email\nservice Yandex, using email account g.mail2017[@]yandex.com.\n\n#### A Second Phishing Email\n\nTwo days later, on October 7, 2016, Satter received a second email that used an identical\ndeception to the first attempt detailed above.\n\n\n-----\n\nagain, similar to Email 1, Citizen Lab found that the originally configured redirection target for\nthis link had been removed.\n\nAnalysis of the email headers in this second phishing attempt show that the message was sent\nwith the web-based email service ‘mail.com’, using email account annaablony[@]mail.com.\n\n**Figure 5: Phishing Email 2**\n\n#### Unauthorized Access\n\nOn October 7 2016, shortly after receiving the email, Satter reports having clicked on the\nchange password link in Email 2, and recalls being redirected to what he now realizes was in\nfact a credential phishing page which appeared to be a legitimate Google sign-in page.\nUnfortunately, Satter had temporarily disabled 2-factor authentication on his account, making\nthe compromise possible.\n\n[Shortly after entering his credentials, Satter’s Gmail account activity page recorded an](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/45938?hl=en&ref_topic=3394218)\nunauthorized login event. The data logged by Google indicated that the login session\n[originated from an IP address in Romania (Figure 6). In Part 2 we will show that the server](https://citizenlab.ca/2017/05/tainted-leaks-disinformation-phish/#part2)\nassociated with this IP address was also hosting the fake Google login page where Satter\nsubmitted his account credentials. Thus it is likely that this malicious server was configured to\nautomatically download the email contents from any compromised accounts (see Figure 7).\n\n\n-----\n\n**account activity page**\n\n[In Part 2](https://citizenlab.ca/2017/05/tainted-leaks-disinformation-phish/#part2) of this report we will outline how the\nphishing links sent to Satter led us to discover\na much wider campaign that included 218\ndistinct targets from government, industry,\nmilitary, and civil society. In the following section, we provide context concerning the\ndisinformation campaign that was conducted around material stolen from Satter’s email\naccount and published on the blog of CyberBerkut, a pro-Russian hacktivist collective.\n\n**Figure 7: How a phishing campaign against Satter became a tainted leaks operation**\n\n## Analyzing a Tainted Leak\n\n_This section compares an original document obtained by Citizen Lab with a tainted document_\n_published online, and used as part of a disinformation campaign. We describe the tainting in_\n_detail, and analyse the likely objective._\n\nSeveral documents from Satter’s emails were posted by CyberBerkut at the same time without\nobservable manipulation. However, one document showed extensive evidence of tainting. The\ntainted leak was a report authored by Satter describing Radio Liberty’s Russian Investigative\nReporting Project. The document was modified to make Satter appear to be paying Russian\njournalists and anti-corruption activists to write stories critical of the Russian Government.\nImportantly, we do not know the process through which the stolen document made its way\nfrom Satter’s inbox to the CyberBerkut release. In the CyberBerkut version, the document is\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 8: CyberBerkut post dated October 22, 2016 showing the narrative**\n**[accompanying the tainted leak document (highlighted with arrow). [Archived copy]](https://web-beta.archive.org/web/20161023062016/http://www.cyber-berkut.org/)**\n\nThe original document lists a series of articles from Radio Liberty exclusively that are part of\nthe project. The articles concern a range of topics: history, economics, and politics. Radio\n_Liberty is a U.S. government international broadcaster, founded in 1951 to broadcast news and_\ninformation into the Soviet Union. It merged with Radio Free Europe in 1976, who now\ntogether are incorporated as a 501(c)(3), funded and overseen by the United States’\nBroadcasting Board of Governors.\n\nThe tainted document modifies the text to appear to be a report on a much larger (nonexistant)\nproject to pay for articles by a range of authors, which would subsequently be published by a\nrange of media outlets. The deceptively inserted articles, almost all of which are genuine\npublications, focus on corruption within Putin’s friends and inner circle. The work of Alexei\nNavalny, a prominent Putin critic, is repeatedly emphasized. The full tainted document is in\n**[Appendix A.](https://citizenlab.ca/2017/05/tainted-leaks-disinformation-phish/#appendixa)**\n\n#### Taint 1: Making reporting look like a secret influence operation\n\nThe operators modified the document’s scope in an attempt to create the appearance of a\nwidespread media campaign. They did this by removing or modifying mentions of Radio Liberty\nthroughout the document.\n\n**Figure 9: Text in red was removed, creating the impression of a wide media campaign,**\n**not the programming of a specific news source.**\n\nOther content, such as discussions of specific translators working for Radio Liberty are\nsimilarly removed to preserve the fiction.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 10: The document was further tweaked to create the impression of a larger**\n**campaign. A note about a translator was also removed as it would contradict the**\n**impression**\n\nWe believe that by removing specific references to Radio Liberty, the perpetrators are aiming\nto give the impression of a broader subversive campaign not limited to a single news\norganization. Doing so allows the perpetrators to falsely associate non-US funded\norganizations, such as independent NGOs, to appear to be linked as part of this larger,\nfictitious program.\n\n**Figure 11: Further tainting to remove mentions of Radio Liberty**\n\nFinally, a clause is deleted at the end of the document concerning the risks of writing “without\nthe protection of a full time job” (Figure 11). This deletion may simply be the tainters removing\nan inconvenient sentence that refers to Radio Liberty, but it also may be an attempt to make\nthe activity look more “cloak and dagger.”\n\n#### Taint 2: Discrediting specific journalists and Kremlin critics\n\nThe original document included a list of 14 articles published as part of the Russian\nInvestigative Project at Radio Liberty. The tainted document includes 24. The operators not\nonly added to the list, but also tweaked the Radio Liberty articles to further the impression of a\nlarger campaign.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 12: Six of the ten added articles. All blue text was added to the original as part of**\n**the tainting. The objective is to make these reports appear to have been supported by**\n**the project.**\n\nTen additional articles were added. Although the original list of publications covered a\nvariety of themes, the added set primarily focuses on issues of corruption, and the wealth of\nthose in Putin’s circle. The articles, written for a range of publications, all share a theme:\ncorruption and personal enrichment by those close to Putin and the Russian Government (See\n**[Appendix A).](https://citizenlab.ca/2017/05/tainted-leaks-disinformation-phish/#appendixa)**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 13: People and Topics of articles added in the tainting. Images: Wikipedia, Radio**\n**[Free Europe, Reuters [click for hi-res]](https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Article-subject-topics-1.png)**\n\nOf special interest are the insertions of Alexei Navalny, a prominent Russian anti-corruption\nactivist and opposition figure whose work, and Anti-corruption Foundation, receives\nwidespread domestic and international attention. By repeatedly adding his reporting to the\ndocument, the tainting creates the appearance of “foreign” funding for his work. This theme\nalso figured prominently in the disinformation campaign surrounding the original publication, on\nOctober 22, 2016, of the tainted document by CyberBerkut (See: Disinformation Campaign\nSurrounding the Tainted Document).\n\n#### Taint 3: Claimed foreknowledge\n\nAn article by Russian journalist Elena Vinogradova describing issues involving “senior Russian\nofficials and businessmen” was also added as part of the tainting, which goes on to state that\n[it will be published by Russian-language news service Vedomosti on October 24-25.4](https://citizenlab.ca/2017/05/tainted-leaks-disinformation-phish/#4)\n\n**Figure 14: Tainting that suggests the operators had advanced knowledge of a news**\n**report**\n\n\n-----\n\noccurred on October 22 2016, slightly before this date.\n\nThe apparent foreknowledge suggests that the individuals responsible for the tainting had\nadvance knowledge of the content and publication date of a piece of investigative journalism,\nwhich may mean the operators had access to intelligence or surveillance reports concerning\nthe activities of the Elena Vinogradova.\n\nWe identified at least one individual among the set of targets of the phishing campaign whose\naccount might have provided this information, however we were not able to confirm a\ncompromise.\n\nImportantly, we were not able to find concrete evidence of the publication of an article\nmatching the description added in the tainting. It is possible that existence of the article was a\nfabrication, or the result of misplaced speculation by the individuals responsible for the\ntainting.\n\n#### Taint 4: Modifying the Time Frame and Supporting Details\n\nThe timeframe and number of publications are increased, perhaps to give the impression of a\nlonger and more intense campaign. Changes are also made to accommodate a wide range of\narticles not published by Radio Liberty but by other parties.\n\n**Figure 15: Dates and numbers changed to accommodate ten more articles**\n\nText that mentions specific dates in the original document that would not accommodate the\narticles that have been falsely added is also changed to support the new fiction.\n\n#### Disinformation Campaign Surrounding the Tainted Document\n\nThe tainted version of the stolen document was released online by CyberBerkut, which\nrepresents itself as a group of pro-Russian hacktivists. CyberBerkut provided the framing\n[narrative for the tainted document in a post on October 22, 2016: they were releasing the](https://web-beta.archive.org/web/20161023062016/http://www.cyber-berkut.org/)\ndocument to provide evidence that the United States was attempting to support a “colour\nrevolution” in Russia. In the CyberBerkut narrative, David Satter was an agent directing the\npublication of articles critical of the Russian government.\n\n\n-----\n\n**[Figure 16: RIA Novosti, Russia’s state operated news agency, reporting the Cyber](https://ria.ru/radio_brief/20161024/1479859708.html)**\n**Berkut’s release of the tainted leaks**\n\nRussia’s state operated news agency RIA Novosti, as well as Sputnik Radio, picked up the\nnarrative, and gave voice to a number of sources who claimed that the “leak” was evidence\nthat the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) was attempting to foment a “colour\nrevolution.” The document was cited in a _[RIA Novosti report as providing evidence of “over](https://ria.ru/radio_brief/20161024/1479859708.html)_\n20” reports intended to discredit the Russian president, and his entourage. The “colour\n[revolution” narrative was echoed in this SM News report, and by](https://sm-news.ru/news/analitika/za-bochku-varenya-korzinu-pechenya/) _[Vesti.lv, among others.](http://www.telegraf.lv/news/v-rossii-ssha-gotovyat-gosperevorot)_\n\nMeanwhile, other Russian-language sources claimed that the document discredited Navalny’s\n[Anti-corruption Foundation by showing that its articles were actually ordered by David Satter.](http://infreactor.org/47652-kiberberkut-rassledovaniya-navalnogo-zakazyval-gosdep)\n\n### The Open Society Foundations Case\n\n\n-----\n\non the “leak” branded site DC Leaks, alongside a wide range of materials stolen from other\norganizations. DC Leaks worked directly with some online outlets, and provided exclusive\naccess to their materials to some, as well as achieving substantial media impact.\n\nThe redundant releases enable a comparison of documents between the two leaks using\npublic materials. The DC Leaks dump included the release of untainted stolen documents that\nhad been previously released as part of a tainted leak by Cyber Berkut. An article in Foreign\nPolicy used this dump to identify several cases of leak tainting. We were able to verify each of\ntheir observations, as well as identifying additional elements of tainting.\n\nWe then contacted OSF’s IT staff, who provided us with the original genuine documents which\nwe were able to use as the basis for further comparisons, and to authenticate the documents\nposted on DC Leaks. Taken together, the tainting appears designed to create the impression\nthat several groups and media outlets, including Alexei Navalny’s Foundation for Fighting\nCorruption, are supported by OSF.\n\nAs with the Satter case, the tainting appears to have a primarily domestic focus, and to be\naimed at de-legitimizing figures like Navalny by making it appear that they are the recipients of\nillicit, foreign funding. This is a view that Navalny, one of the targets of the tainting, has also\n[expressed to Foreign Policy.](https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/08/22/turns-out-you-cant-trust-russian-hackers-anymore/)\n\n#### A Budget Document\n\n[First, CyberBerkut released a tainted budget document to make it appear as if OSF was](http://www.cyber-berkut.ru/docs/Eliz+Master+Budget+HRGGP+Russia+update+11-09-2012.pdf)\nfunding Alexei Navalny’s Foundation for Fighting Corruption.\n\n**Figure 17: Tainted Budget Document: the second row was added to make it appear as if**\n**OSF was funding Navalny’s Foundation for Fighting Corruption**\n\nThe tainters may have been working quickly, resulting in a small error, in which a dollar amount\nwas substituted for “Approved Date.”\n\n#### Proposed Strategy Document\n\n[Second, a proposed funding strategy document was similarly modified to include the](http://www.cyber-berkut.ru/docs/Russia+-+2014-2017+Proposed+Strategy.pdf)\nFoundation for Fighting Corruption in a list of groups to receive OSF support.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 18: Proposed Strategy Document showing the location where the tainted**\n**document is modified to include mention of the Foundation for Fighting Corruption**\n\nThe tainting resumed later in the document, when several media outlets (Echo Moscow,\n_RosBusinessConsulting, and Vedomosti) were also added to the document, apparently to_\ncreate the perception that they had received the support of OSF.\n\n**Figure 19: A second section in the same document showing once more how several**\n**media outlets, including Echo Moscow, RosBusinessConsulting, and Vedomosti have**\n**been added.**\n\nThe second instance of tainting in the strategy document also introduced a slight grammatical\nerror when the tainters neglected to remove “an” before changing “news site” to the plural\n“news sites.”\n\n#### Document Addressing the NGO Law\n\n[Finally, in a document addressing grantees and Russia’s NGO law, tainting was again](https://www.hrw.org/russia-government-against-rights-groups-battle-chronicle)\n[performed to add Navalny’s Foundation for Fighting Corruption. The tainting also purported to](http://www.cyber-berkut.ru/docs/RP+Grantee+NGO+Law+Decision+Chart.pdf)\nshow the foundation receiving money via Yandex, a widely-used Russian platform offering an\nonline payment service.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 20: Tainted document, once more showing the addition of Navalny’s Foundation**\n**for Fighting Corruption**\n\nTaken together, both the tainted document stolen from David Satter, and the tainted OSF\ndocuments paint a picture of a competent adversary working to achieve several objectives,\nincluding discrediting domestic critics of Russia’s government and president, while\n[simultaneously attempting to embarrass foreign funders with activities in Russia. In Part 4 we](https://citizenlab.ca/2017/05/tainted-leaks-disinformation-phish/#part4)\ndiscuss the significance of tainted leaks as a disinformation technique.\n\n## Part 2: A Tiny Discovery\n\n_Beginning with the shortened link sent to David Satter, we identified a predictable feature in_\n_how the link shortener (Tiny.cc) generated its shortened URLs. This enabled us to identify over_\n_200 additional targets of the same operation described in_ **_[Part 1. This section describes the](https://citizenlab.ca/2017/05/tainted-leaks-disinformation-phish/#part1)_**\n_process used to enumerate these targets, and further describes the links between this_\n_operation and other publicly-reported Russian-linked phishing campaigns._\n\n[In September 2016, ThreatConnect published a blog post documenting phishing attempts](https://www.threatconnect.com/blog/russia-hacks-bellingcat-mh17-investigation/)\nagainst contributors to the citizen journalism website Bellingcat and its founder Eliot Higgins.\nThe targeted contributors were actively engaged in reporting on the Russian involvement in the\nJuly 17, 2014 downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17. ThreatConnect attributed these intrusion\n[attempts to Fancy Bear (aka APT28), a threat actor widely believed to be directly linked to the](https://www.crowdstrike.com/wp-content/brochures/FancyBearTracksUkrainianArtillery.pdf)\nRussian government. In an October update to this post, ThreatConnect documented an\nadditional spear phishing attempt against a Bellingcat contributor.\n\nThis latest credential phishing attempt was largely similar to the first email sent to David Satter\n(see **[Part 1, The Case of David Satter). Both emails were sent at 10:59am EST using the same](https://citizenlab.ca/2017/05/tainted-leaks-disinformation-phish/#part1)**\nsending address: g.mail2017[@]yandex.com. In addition, both shared a fake Gmail footer that\nwas distinctively modified from Gmail’s original footer.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 21: Footer from the phishing emails sent to Bellingcat and David Satter showing**\n**a distinctive misspelling (possibly to avoid spam filtering)**\n\nIn both cases the malicious links embedded in these phishing emails were configured to\n[redirect the targets to addresses hosted on the URL shortening service Tiny.cc. As](http://tiny.cc/)\nThreatConnect showed, the Tiny.cc link used against the Bellingcat contributor actually\nredirected the victim to another shortened URL, this one hosted by a different shortening\nservice: TinyURL.com. Ultimately, this series of link redirections led to a malicious credential\nphishing page hosted at the following URL:\n\nhxxp://myaccount.google.com-changepasswordsecuritypagesettingmyaccountgooglepagelogin.id833[.]ga\n\n**Table 1: Domain hosting the credential phishing page**\n\n[Using PassiveTotal, we examined the historic DNS resolution data for this domain name. The](https://passivetotal.org/)\nresults revealed that at the time of these phishing attempts, the domain id833[.]ga resolved to\nIP address 89.40.181[.]119 – the same Romanian IP address used to access David Satter’s\nemail account on October 7 (see Part 1, The Case of David Satter).\n\nThis evidence suggests that the Bellingcat contributor and David Satter were both targeted by\nthe same spear phishing campaign; this linkage will be explored further in the next section.\n\n### Tiny.cc Enumeration\n\nIn examining the Tiny.cc shortened URLs found within the spear phishing emails sent to David\nSatter, we became curious as to the structure of how such links were constructed.\n\nTiny.cc provides a shortening service which allows users to create succinct URLs that redirect\nto some defined, usually long, website address. By way of example, we created a Tiny.cc\nshortened URL which redirects to a recent Citizen Lab report:\n\n[http://tiny.cc/bj87iy -> https://citizenlab.ca/2017/02/bittersweet-nso-mexico-spyware/](http://tiny.cc/bj87iy)\nIn this example, the Tiny.cc shortcode would be bj87iy. In the Tiny.cc application back-end\ndatabase, this hash uniquely resolves to the target address of:\n\nhttps://citizenlab.ca/2017/02/bittersweet-nso-mexico-spyware/\n\nAfter conducting tests, we determined that these shortcodes are assigned in a sequential\nmanner. For example, using the Tiny.cc API call for creating a shortened URL, we\nprogrammatically generated 8 links with a one-second delay between each call. The resulting\nshortcodes generated (in order) were as follows:\n\n\n-----\n\n73q6iy\n93q6iy\ne4q6iy\np4q6iy\nr4q6iy\nt4q6iy\n24q6iy\n\nAfter conducting numerous similar tests, we determined that shortcodes constructed within\nsmall temporal windows would be lexically close in the sense of the following ‘base36\nalphabet’ sequence:\n\na,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l,m,n,o,p,q,r,s,t,u,v,w,x,y,z,0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\n\nSuccessive shortcodes are constructed by iterating the leftmost character through this base36\nalphabet. Once all 36 characters have been exhausted, this leftmost character reverts to the\ninitial value of ‘a’, with the second character then iterating one position according to the same\nalphabet. This iterative process continues for each position of the shortcode (see Figure 22),\nenabling us to consider the shortcodes as a sort of base36 ‘counter’.\n\n**Figure 22: Enumerating the base36 shortcodes used by tiny.cc**\n\nGiven this understanding of the shortcode design, we can measure the notional ‘distance’\nbetween any pair of shortcodes. For example, the distance between the shortcodes bj87iy\nand cj87iy would be 1, and the distance between bj87iy and bk87iy would be 36.\n\n\n-----\n\nextension, how close in time they were generated. We will revisit this notion of distance below.\n\nUsing this design knowledge, we considered the Tiny.cc shortcodes found in the October 5 and\n7 phishing emails sent to David Satter. Using these as a starting point, we enumerated\napproximately 4000 adjacent shortcodes for each, and then examined the target web\naddresses to which these short links redirected. From this large list, we extracted all of the\nassociated destination links (see Figure 23) which redirected to the malicious phishing domain\ndescribed above in Table 1.\n\n**Figure 23: Some of the phishing links discovered during enumeration of the Tiny.cc**\n**shortcodes**\n\nThis enumeration led us to discover evidence suggesting that David Satter and the unnamed\nBellingcat journalist were but two targets of a much larger credential phishing campaign.\n[Notably, as mentioned above in Part 1: A Second Phishing E-mail, when we checked the](https://citizenlab.ca/2017/05/tainted-leaks-disinformation-phish/#part1)\nparticular Tiny.cc shortcode received by Satter, the unshortened link to the phishing page had\nbeen replaced with a benign URL: myaccount.google[.]com.\n\nWe were unable to conclusively determine the reason for this substitution. One theory\nsuggests that the campaign operators mistakenly shortened incorrect destination URLs, while\nanother posits that once the operators had successfully compromised a target’s account, they\nwould inoculate the Tiny.cc link provided in the phishing email. Indeed, in the same batch of\nenumerated shortcodes from the October campaign, we found four additional shortcodes which\nalso pointed to myaccount.google[.]com.\n\n### Decoding the targets\n\nWe examined the “unshortened” URLs of shortcodes that were adjacent to the one sent to\nSatter, and discovered 25 distinct destination addresses of the form:\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/tinyurl.com/(redacted)\n\nThese addresses were redirects which leveraged the previously mentioned, Google-hosted,\nopen redirect page (google.com/amp/) to send a user to a link on the TinyURL.com shortening\n\n\n-----\n\nhxxp://myaccount.google.com-changepasswordsecuritypagesettingmyaccountgooglepagelogin.id833[.]ga/security/signinoptions/password\n\nThis domain, discussed above and noted in Table 1, at the time the phishing emails were sent,\nresolved to the Romanian IP address used to access Satter’s Gmail account (see Part 1).\n\nIn order to bolster the social engineering aspect of these fake Gmail login pages, the operator\nused a series of base64-encoded URL parameter values in order to display the target’s email\naddress, and in some cases the target’s name and Google profile image, into the appropriate\nfields on the fake login page.\n\n**Figure 24: TinyURL preview of a second level redirect of a phishing link**\n\nThe following example URL illustrates the use of these parameters (Figure 25):\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 25: URL parameter decoding from a phishing link**\n\nBy virtue of this pattern of URL parameters, we were able to determine the precise target of\neach of the phishing links we discovered during our enumeration process. The significance of\n[this pattern of URL parameters will be revisited below in Part 3.](https://citizenlab.ca/2017/05/tainted-leaks-disinformation-phish/#part3)\n\n### Digging Deeper\n\nExtending the search for suspicious URLs by fully enumerating the entire six-character\n[shortcode sequence space in the above manner proved to be intractable.5](https://citizenlab.ca/2017/05/tainted-leaks-disinformation-phish/#5) However, the same\nThreatConnect report discussed above also documented a previous APT28-attributed phishing\nattempt against Bellingcat journalist Aric Toler. On June 16, 2016, Toler was sent a strikingly\nsimilar Google-themed phishing email containing a Tiny.cc shortcode. Following the same\nprocess outlined above, we enumerated the shortcodes adjacent to the one published by\nThreatConnect.\n\nIn doing so, we discovered another group of targets – 198 target email addresses in total. In\nthis earlier campaign, the unshortened URLs pointed directly to the likely phishing page\n(Figure 26):\n\n**Figure 26: URL parameters in June campaign against Aric Toler**\n\nNotably, these links appear to be hosted on the Google Blogger service, and while these\npages were already taken offline when we attempted to examine them, the same characteristic\nURL parameterization can be observed.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Pandora’s Un-Shortening: Civil Society Targets Emerge).](https://citizenlab.ca/2017/05/tainted-leaks-disinformation-phish/#pandorasunshortening)\n\n### Testing the Lure\n\nWe measured the distance between successive malicious Tiny.cc shortcodes seen in the June\nand October campaigns (Figure 27). In doing so, we observed fairly consistent distances\nbetween the shortcodes, perhaps indicating that the operators were generating these links via\nan automated process. However, one shortcode stood out, and we suspected this may have\nbeen a manual operator test.\n\n**Figure 27: The anomalous distance of 305 immediately stood out from the average of**\n**8.2, drawing our attention to the shortened link**\n\nAccording to the parameters obtained from the phishing URL associated with this anomalous\nshortcode, we were able to decode the Gmail account targeted with this phishing link:\n\n\n-----\n\nEmail Address myprimaryreger[@]gmail.com\n\nFull Name Åhlén ﺧﺴﺮوي\n\nGoogle+ Profile Picture\n\n**Table 2: URL parameter values decoded**\n\nThis Google account, myprimaryreger[@]gmail.com, was also used in the registration of at\n[least one other domain name which was linked in prior research to known or suspected APT28](https://www.threatconnect.com/blog/how-to-investigate-incidents-in-threatconnect/)\nactivity. Such connections, while circumstantial, further support the link to Russia-based threat\nactors.\n\nIn **[Appendix B we provide a brief description of why we think the account is being used by the](https://citizenlab.ca/2017/05/tainted-leaks-disinformation-phish/#appendixb)**\noperator, and how the account uses Google Plus posts to embed images into phishing e-mails.\n\n## Part 3: Connections to Publicly Reported Operations\n\n_This section outlines the connections and overlaps between the operation described in this_\n_report and other, publicly-reported Russian-affiliated cyber espionage campaigns._\n\nThe operator test uncovered during our enumeration of the Tiny.cc shortcodes (see **Testing**\n**the Lure above), provides a circumstantial link to APT28, however there are other potential**\nlinks. In this section, we outline other comparisons between this campaign and other publicly\nreported operations that have a Russian nexus. We identify marked similarities to a collection\nof phishing links now attributed to one of the most publicly visible information operations in\nrecent history: the targeting of the 2016 US Presidential Campaign.\n\n### A Bit More Abuse\n\nThe phishing URLs in this campaign were encoded with a distinct set of parameters using\nbase64. When clicked, the links provided key information about the targets to the phishing\nwebsite. An identical approach to parameters and encoding (see Figure 28 below) has been\nseen before: in the March 2016 phishing campaign that targeted Hillary Clinton’s presidential\ncampaign and the Democratic National Committee. This similarity suggests possible code reuse: the two operations may be using the same phishing ‘kit’.\n\n[The campaign that targeted the DNC also included the same Google security-themed phishing](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/how-hackers-broke-into-john-podesta-and-colin-powells-gmail-accounts)\n[ruse, and abused another URL shortening service, Bit.ly. In June 2016 Dell SecureWorks](http://bit.ly/)\n\n\n-----\n\nSecureWorks researchers were able to enumerate and analyze the targets of this campaign,\nthus allowing them to describe the victimology:\n\n_“individuals in Russia and the former Soviet states, current and former military and government_\n_personnel in the U.S. and Europe, individuals working in the defense and government supply_\n_chain, and authors and journalists — but also included email accounts linked to the November_\n_2016 United States presidential election”_\n\nThis victimology strikes an immediate parallel to the target listing we have uncovered in our\nenumeration of the Tiny.cc URLs.\n\n**Figure 28: Bitly link and ultimate phishing page address sent to John Podesta, former**\n**chairman of the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, in March 2016**\n\n### Domain Schema Commonalities\n\nWe found similarities in domain naming, and subdomain structures, between this campaign\nand operations linked to APT28.\n\nThe domain used in the campaign targeting Satter was id833[.]ga. At the time of the\ncampaign, this domain name was pointed to a server at IP address 89.40.181[.]119. Using\nPassiveTotal, we observed other domain names sharing a similar naming scheme also\ndirected at this IP: id834[.]ga, and id9954[.]gq. While we did not observe any phishing links\nfor these alternate domains, there were identical subdomains registered for both:\n\n**Domain** **Sub-Domain**\n\nid833[.]ga myaccount.google.com-changepassword-securitypagesettingmyaccountgooglepagelogin\n\nid834[.]ga myaccount.google.com-changepassword-securitypagesettingmyaccountgooglepagelogin\n\nid9954[.]gq myaccount.google.com-changepassword-securitypagesettingmyaccountgooglepagelogin\n\nThis domain / subdomain naming schema is also extremely close to one featured in\n[Mandiant’s 2017 M-Trends report, in a phishing operation, linked to APT28, which targeted](https://www.fireeye.com/current-threats/annual-threat-report/mtrends.html)\n\n\n-----\n\nDomain linked to this campaign:\n**myaccount.google.com-changepassword-**\n**securitypagesettingmyaccountgooglepagelogin.id833[.]ga**\nDomain mentioned by Mandiant, linked to APT28:myaccount.google.com**changepassword-securitypagesettingmyaccountgooglepage.id4242[.]ga**\n\nThe similarities in naming and subdomain structure are immediately apparent. The two\ndomains (id833[.]ga and id4242[.]ga) also share a common name server. However, we were\nnot able to find specific registration overlaps between the domains or servers.\n\nFurthermore, during the campaign period, the domain identified by Mandiant, id4242[.]ga\nresolved to 89.32.40[.]238. This IP also resolves to a range of other suspicious domains with\nhighly similar naming schemas to those connected to the infrastructure used against Satter.\nThe link used to phish John Podesta, as depicted above, also shares distinct naming and\nsubdomain similarities with domains linked to the phishing operation against Satter (see Figure\n28):\n\nDomain targeting Podesta, linked to APT28: hxxp://myaccount.google.comsecuritysettingpage[.]tk\n\nDuring the campaign in March 2016, this domain was hosted at IP address 80.255.12[.]237\n\nPublications from numerous private industry groups attribute 89.32.40[.]238 and\n**80.255.12[.]237 (as well as related domains) to APT28. While we are able to point out that**\nthere are significant commonalities in domain naming and subdomain structure between the\ncampaign targeting Satter and domains linked to these IPs, we are not able to make a more\nconclusive technical link to APT28.\n\n[While industry groups as well as the U.S. government have publicly connected APT28 with](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2014/10/apt28-a-window-into-russias-cyber-espionage-operations.html)\nRussian state actors, we are not able to use infrastructure analysis alone to conclusively\nconnect the operation against Satter to a particular state sponsor. Connecting this\ninfrastructure to a specific government would require additional evidence which is not, to our\nknowledge, available in the public domain.\n\n### The Challenge of Attribution\n\nWhile the order of events surrounding the phishing, credential theft, and eventual leak of\ntainted documents belonging to David Satter would seem to point to CyberBerkut, the\ncharacteristics of Russian information operations make the task of attribution to a state\nsponsor challenging. As a consequence, there is no “smoking gun” connecting the evidence\nwe have assembled to a particular Russian government agency, despite the overlaps between\nour evidence and that presented by numerous industry and government reports concerning\nRussian-affiliated threat actors.\n\n\n-----\n\noperators, and the high number of independently operating, overlapping, and sometimes\ncompeting spy agencies and security services all of whom work within a broad culture of barely\nconcealed corruption. As one study on Russia notes, Russia’s many security agencies “are\ngranted considerable latitude in their methods, unconstrained by the concerns of diplomats or\nthe scrutiny of legislators.”\n\n[Russia’s approach to the use of proxy actors in the criminal underworld in particular is](https://academic.oup.com/jcsl/article/21/3/383/2566739/Proxies-and-Cyberspace)\ninformed by a very elaborate strategy around information operations and control. Although this\nstrategy has roots that go back deep into Soviet (and even earlier Russian) history, it was more\n[fully elaborated as a component of hybrid warfare, also known as the Gerasimov doctrine or](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?publication_year=February+2013&pages=1-2&author=Valery+Gerasimov&title=Tsennost%E2%80%99+nauki+v+predvidenii)\n[“non-linear warfare,” and infused with deeper resources after the ‘color revolutions,’ the 2011](http://foreignpolicy.com/2014/05/05/how-putin-is-reinventing-warfare/)\nMoscow protests, and upon reflection of the events of the Arab Spring. The overall Russian\n[approach has been described as a form of “guerrilla geopolitics” in which “a would-be great](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09592318.2015.1129170?scroll=top&needAccess=true)\npower, aware that its ambitions outstrip its military resources, seeks to leverage the\nmethodologies of an insurgent to maximise its capabilities.” Cultivating organized criminal\ngroups is a fundamental component of this approach, as evidenced in the annexation of\nCrimea which was undertaken in coordination with criminal elements who provided “political\nand military muscle.” Russian security officers are also known to routinely dabble in the\nproceeds of underworld criminal operations for illicit revenue of their own, and as a result can\neven prioritize criminal over national security concerns.\n\nIn the digital arena, this doctrine is manifest in the cultivation of Internet-focused organized\ncriminal groups who operate partially on behalf of or in support of the Putin regime, and\n[partially oriented around their own pecuniary gain in online financial fraud and other schemes.](https://www.wired.com/2017/03/russian-hacker-spy-botnet/)\n[There is evidence Russian hackers are being given wide latitude to undertake criminal](https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/03/16/world/europe/russian-hacker-fsb-agent-dmitry-dokuchaev.html?_r=1&referer&utm_content=buffer43117&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer)\nactivities as long as it conforms to Russian security agencies’ wishes. Multiple Russianaffiliated operators could compromise the same target unwittingly and without seeming\ncoordination. This “piling on” around a target further complicates attribution. This\ncomplex proxy strategy, as well as the multiple, competing agencies behind the proxies, is\noften lost or overlooked when companies and government agencies jump quickly to attribution\naround Russian cyber espionage.\n\nWhile it is possible that a proxy actor is implementing the front-end collection component of the\nphishing campaign we are describing, the scale of the targeting also suggests a wellresourced actor, such as a nation state. The thread linking all of the targets is their connection\nto issues that the Russian government cares about. The targets are people whose positions or\nactivities give them access to, or influence over, sensitive information of specific interest to\nRussia. This links an otherwise extremely diverse target set, which ranges from domestic\nKremlin critics and journalists, to anti-corruption investigators, foreign government personnel,\nand businesspeople.\n\nThe data collected from such a campaign would come in more than a dozen languages, and\nconcern a diverse range of political, military, and policy issues from at least 39 countries and\n\n\n-----\n\neffective post-collection analysis of the stolen data. Even greater resources would be required\nto analyse, and in some instances carefully modify in a short timeframe, the contents of stolen\nemail and cloud-storage accounts for the purposes of seeding disinformation via tainted leaks.\n\nThe diversity and presumed cost of analyzing the stolen data along with the clear Russian\nnexus for the targets is only circumstantial evidence of a Russian connection. It should be\nevaluated in the context of the other pieces of circumstantial evidence we present, including\nthe overlaps in tactics with known Russia-linked actors, and the prominent role of\nCyberBerkut.\n\n## Part 4: Discussion\n\n_In this section, we examine the troubling relationship between espionage and disinformation,_\n_particularly in its latest digital manifestation, and elaborate on how civil society is particularly at_\n_risk from such new tactics._\n\n### Tainted Leaks: A New Trend\n\nThe recent theft and disclosure of documents (branded as a “leak”) from the presidential\ncampaign of Emmanuel Macron is the highest profile case in which it appears that falsified\ndocuments were inserted amongst real, stolen documents. The documents falsely implied a\nrange of improper or questionable activities. The false stories implied by these documents\n[were then highlighted in campaigns promoted with twitter bots and other techniques. The leak-](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-election-cyber-idUSKBN1820QO)\n[branded release had followed the release, several days earlier, of a quickly-debunked story,](http://observers.france24.com/en/20170505-france-elections-macron-lepen-offshore-bahamas-debunked)\nsupported by falsified documents, alleging that Macron held foreign bank accounts.\n\nIn the case of the leak-branded releases during the 2016 US presidential election, the publiclyavailable evidence connecting these releases with Russian-affiliated cyber operations is\nlargely circumstantial, but compelling. It is reported, and highly probable, that stronger\n[evidence is available in classified venues. Building on initial reports by Trend Micro that the](https://www.justsecurity.org/35989/dhsfbi-report-russian-hacking-predictable-failure/)\n[Macron campaign was targeted by APT28,’ follow-up reports have pointed to Russian](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cyber-attacks/espionage-cyber-propaganda-two-years-of-pawn-storm)\n[involvement in the breach, and the tainted leaks.](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/09/world/europe/hackers-came-but-the-french-were-prepared.html)\n\nThe Macron case continues to develop, and many elements are still uncertain, including\nwhether the Macron campaign was deliberately seeding their own communications with false\n[documents, intended to slow down operators’ analysis pipeline. However, it is not the first case](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/09/world/europe/hackers-came-but-the-french-were-prepared.html)\nin which evidence or claims of tainted leaks have surfaced.\n\nDocuments stolen from the Open Society Foundations, which had been the victim of a breach,\nwere modified and then released in a tainted leak by CyberBerkut in a post dated November\n21 2015. The tainting included careful alterations, such as modifying budget documents, to\nmake it appear that certain Russian civil society groups were receiving foreign funding. The\ncase became publicly visible because elements of the same stolen set were re-released on the\nl k b d d b it “DC L k ” ith t th t i ti\n\n\n-----\n\nthen tainted, materials were edited, spliced, and deleted, while new text was added.\n**Fiction was added to fact to create a hybrid “tainted leak.” The tainted leak told a series of**\nnew, false stories, intended not only to discredit Satter, but to support domestic narratives\nfamiliar to many Russians: of foreign interference, and of a foreign hand behind criticism of the\ngovernment.\n\n#### Falsehoods in a Forest of Facts\n\nRecent leaks by genuine whistleblowers, as well as “leak”-branded releases of materials stolen\nby cyber espionage operations (e.g. “DC Leaks” or “Macron Leaks”) are appealing because\nthey appear to provide an un-filtered peek at people speaking privately. Like an intercepted\nconversation, they feel closer to the “truth,” and may indeed reveal unscripted truths about\npeople and institutions. It is hard not to be curious about what salacious details might be\ncontained within them. In the 2016 United States presidential election, it was evident that the\nrelease, although clearly intended to influence the election, was viewed by most media\norganizations as having intrinsic newsworthiness, and thus the contents of leaks were often\nquickly amplified and repeated.\n\nThe potential of leaks to attract attention makes large dumps of stolen materials fertile ground\nfor tainting. A carefully constructed tainted leak included in a set of real stolen material is\nsurrounded by documents that, by juxtaposition, indirectly signal that it is legitimate. This could\nhelp the tainted leak survive initial scrutiny by reporters and others seeking corroboration.\nCoupled with a media strategy, or social-media amplification campaign that selectively\nhighlights the fake or the narrative that the fake supports, leak tainting poses a serious problem\nto both the victim of the breach, and whoever is implicated by the disinformation.\n\nThe spread of disinformation can contribute to cynicism about the media and institutions at\nlarge as being untrustworthy and unreliable, and can cultivate a fatigue among the population\nabout deciphering what is true or not. By propagating falsehoods, the aim is not necessarily to\nconvince a population that the falsehood is true (although that outcome is desirable) but rather\nto have them question the integrity of all media as equally unreliable, and in doing so “foster a\nkind of policy paralysis.”\n\n#### Tainted Leaks Place a Unique Burden on Breach Victims\n\nShould a tainted document gain traction, there is a burden on the victim of the disinformation to\nprove that the leaks are not genuine. This challenge may be difficult. Victims of breaches may\nbe unable, unwilling, or forbidden to release original documents. Moreover, they may not wish\nto be drawn into fact-checking their own stolen data. This problem is likely to be especially true\nif the operators behind the tainted leaks have chosen documents that are themselves\nsensitive.\n\nA Russian anti-corruption activist whose name has been seeded into such sensitive reports\nmay not be able to convince the original victim of the breach to release the authentic\n\n\n-----\n\nthemselves.\n\nMeanwhile, members of the public do not have the ability to carefully verify the integrity of\nsuch dumps, either as a whole, or specific documents within them. Indeed, even journalists\nreporting on accusations or falsehoods may be unable to obtain explicit confirmation of which\nexact material has been faked. If a tainted document is carefully constructed from real,\nverifiable elements, it may be especially difficult to identify as a fake. Even if journalists do the\nhard digging and analysis, they may not be able to publish their results in a timely enough\nfashion to matter. By the time their work is complete, the false information may have\nembedded itself into the collective consciousness.\n\n[Disinformation can persist and spread unless concerted measures are taken to counter it.](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-experimental-political-science/article/div-classtitledisplacing-misinformation-about-events-an-experimental-test-of-causal-correctionsdiv/69550AB61F4E3F7C2CD03532FC740D05)\n[Even more insidious is the fact that studies have found that attempts “to quash rumors](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-political-science/article/rumors-and-health-care-reform-experiments-in-political-misinformation/8B88568CD057242D2D97649300215CF2)\nthrough direct refutation may facilitate their diffusion by increasing fluency.” In other words,\nefforts to correct falsehoods can ironically contribute to their further propagation and even\nacceptance.\n\nNot all tainted leaks work as intended to cause maximum harm. Almost immediately following\nthe “Macron Leaks,” the Macron campaign responded quickly, and stated that the “leaks”\nincluded fakes. In the fast-moving media environment in the days before voting, this move may\nhave led to uncertainty about the factual nature of the release in the minds of many journalists,\ndimming enthusiasm to quickly report ‘finds.’ Amplification of the “leaks” was further blocked\n[by a “recommendation to media” by the French electoral authority to not “relay” the leaks. The](http://www.cnccep.fr/communiques/cp14.html)\nauthority pointed to the presence of fakes, and warned of possible legal implications for\nreporting the story.\n\n[Following the voting, staff from the Macron campaign claimed in the media that the stolen](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2017/05/06/did-macron-outsmart-campaign-hackers)\ndocuments also likely contained fakes created by the campaign, designed to waste the time of\nintruders. This claim also cast further doubt on the veracity of any documents contained in the\n“leaks.”\n\n#### Tainted Leaks: Old Methods, New Tactics\n\nStealing digital information for intelligence purposes is a well-known and commonly practiced\ntactic used by states. However, a unique aspect of Russian cyber espionage distinguishing it\nfrom other governments is the public release of exfiltrated data intended to embarrass or\ndiscredit adversaries. Known as “kompromat”, this type of activity is common in Russia, and\nwas previously used by the Soviet Union, and is evident in the publication of emails on\nWikileaks related to United States officials involved in the 2016 U.S. presidential election\ncampaign.\n\nReleasing Satter’s e-mails could be roughly described as kompromat. However, with his\ncooperation we were able to identify a second feature of the release: the deliberate tampering\nwith the content of his messages. This mixing of fact and falsehood is thus also a\n\n\n-----\n\nIn Russian / Soviet military doctrine, the practice of deliberately propagating forged documents\n[and disinformation is known as “dezinformatsiya”, referring to manipulation of information in](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/604084/russian-disinformation-technology/)\nthe service of the propagation of falsehoods. Although practiced for decades by Russia and\nthe Soviet Union, the use of dezinformatsiya in connection with cyber espionage is a new and\ntroublesome frontier in structured digital disinformation.\n\n### Why Target Civil Society?\n\nOur investigation identified civil society targets inside and outside of Russia. This targeting is\n[consistent with a general consensus on how the Russian regime thinks: whether domestic or](http://fpc.org.uk/fsblob/1786.pdf)\nforeign, civil society is treated as a threat to the regime, its extended kleptocracy, and the\nsovereignty of the country.\n\nThere are at least two reasons why civil society factors highly into Russian perceptions of\nthreats. First, independent civil society groups can create difficulties for the regime by\nspotlighting corruption and abuse of power, speaking freely about issues the government\nwould rather keep in the shadows, and mobilizing people into organized opposition.\n\nThose unfamiliar with the Russian experience may overlook a second motivation, which is\ndrawn from the larger Russian narrative of humiliation and defeat at the hands of the United\nStates and its allies at the end of the Cold War. Some Russian leaders, especially those tied\nto the old Soviet system, resent US triumphalism, and see local civil society (except for those\nunder their direct control) as instruments of US and western interference in Russian domestic\n[politics. For example, Putin used the term “active measures” to describe the actions of then-](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/06/opinion/for-putin-disinformation-is-power.html)\nSecretary of State Hillary Clinton during the 2011 Moscow demonstration. This narrative of\n[Russia as a “besieged fortress” is used as justification for the repression and targeting of civil](https://books.google.ca/books?id=w-WqCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA188&lpg=PA188&dq=russia+besieged+mark+galeotti&source=bl&ots=sPESrA6ri7&sig=QWCDpvxBpbu_BIl9orC7cmGQ_T8&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj4jYSeitnTAhUL7IMKHavnC94Q6AEIMDAC#v=onepage&q=russia besieged mark galeotti&f=false)\nsociety groups both inside Russia proper, in the former Soviet spaces, and abroad.\n\nWhile often overlooked by western media and policymakers, this threat model translates in\npractice into targeted digital surveillance operations on civil society, both domestically and\nabroad. Of special concern to the government are NGOs, journalists, and activists that are\nseen as having links to the West and / or are funded by western governments. Many of the\ntargets of this campaign are connected in some degree to United States-based think tanks and\nfellowships.\n\nOf equal concern to the government, however, are the actions of domestic NGOs and\nindividuals. As our report shows, a principal motivation for the targeting of David Satter and\nthe tainting of leaks derived from materials stolen from him was to falsely portray local Russian\ngroups as having affiliations and even funding ties to western organizations and the U.S.\ngovernment.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTainted leaks are a growing and particularly troublesome addition to disinformation tactics and\n\n\n-----\n\npolitical party and candidate for election directly. The target of the tainting was roughly the\nsame entity that suffered the breach. In the cases we analyzed, however, tainted leaks were\nused to discredit third parties who had not been the victims of the original breach. This\ndifference highlights yet another facet of the growing trend of leak-branded releases, and the\nchallenges they pose.\n\nTainted leaks—fakes in a forest of facts—test the limits of how media, citizen journalism, and\nsocial media users handle fact checking, and the amplification of enticing, but questionable\ninformation. As a tactic, tainted leaks are an evolution of much older strategies for\ndisinformation, and like these earlier strategies, pose a clear threat to public trust in the\nintegrity of information. Interestingly, while the tainting we describe appears to have a primarily\ndomestic aim, to discredit elements of the Russian opposition, it is readily applied globally.\n\nThe report identified a phishing campaign with over 200 unique targets from 39 countries. We\ndo not conclusively attribute the technical elements of this campaign to a particular sponsor,\nbut there are numerous elements in common between the campaign we analyzed and that\nwhich has been publicly reported by industry groups as belonging to threat actors affiliated with\nRussia.\n\nGiven Russia’s well-known preference for the use of proxy actors, it would be highly unlikely\nthat a group such as ours, which relies on open source information, would be able to discover a\nconclusive link in a case like this. However, it is worth reiterating that the resources of a\ngovernment would likely be necessary to manage such a large and ambitious campaign, given\nthe number of languages spoken by targets, and their areas of work. The group includes a\nformer Russian Prime Minister, a global list of government ministers, ambassadors, military\nand government personnel, CEOs of oil companies, and members of civil society from more\nthan three dozen countries.\n\nThe targets we found are connected to, or have access to, information concerning issues in\nwhich the Russian government has a demonstrated interest. These issues range from\ninvestigations of individuals close to the Russian president, to the Ukraine, NATO, foreign\nthink tanks working on Russia and the Crimea, grantmakers supporting human rights and free\nexpression in Russia, and the energy sector in the Caucasus.\n\nConsidering this primary Russian focus, as well as the technical evidence pointing to overlaps\nand stylistic similarities with groups attributed to the Russian government, we believe there is\nstrong circumstantial—but not conclusive—evidence for Russian government sponsorship of\nthe phishing campaign, and the tainted leaks.\n\nThe civil society targets of this operation deserve special attention. At least 21% of the targets\nfrom our set were journalists, activists, scholars and other members of civil society. All too\noften, threats against civil society groups receive second-billing in industry reporting and media\ncoverage of government-linked operations.\n\n\n-----\n\nfor grantmakers, several dozen targets all held the same fellowship, from the same\norganization. This common affiliation suggests that they may have been targeted because of\ntheir relationship with the grantmaker.\n\nWe hope this report will encourage others to engage in further research into the techniques\nused to propagate tainted leaks, as well as serving as a reminder of the often under-reported\npresence of civil society targets among government-linked phishing and malware operations.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nSpecial thanks to David Satter, Raphael Satter, and the Open Society Foundations for\ncooperating and providing us with materials necessary to conduct the investigation.\n\nThanks to the Citizen Lab team who provided review and assistance, especially Bill Marczak,\nMasashi Crete-Nishihata, Etienne Maynier, Adam Senft, Irene Poetranto, and Amitpal Singh.\n\nWe would like to thank additional researchers for comments and feedback including Jen\nWeedon, Alberto Fittarelli, Exigent Petrel and TNG.\n\nSupport for Citizen Lab’s research on targeted threats comes from the John D. and Catherine\nT.
