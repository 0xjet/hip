At the same time, Bitcoin alternatives like Monero and Ethereum continue their overall upward trend in value (Figure 1), putting them\nsquarely in the crosshairs of threat actors looking for quick profits and anonymous transactions. Because obtaining these cryptocurrencies\n[through legitimate mining mechanisms is quite resource-intensive, cybercriminals are stealing them, demanding ransomware payments in](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-japan-cryptocurrency-cybercrime/exclusive-coincheck-hackers-trying-to-move-stolen-cryptocurrency-executive-idUSKBN1FJ28Y)\nthem, and [harnessing other computers to mine them for free. Recently, Proofpoint researchers have been tracking the massive Smominru](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/dialing-dollars-coinminers-appearing-malware-components-standalone-threats)\nbotnet, the combined computing power of which has earned millions of dollars for its operators.\n\n_Figure 1: Monero cryptocurrency values (top) and relative values of major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, over the past year (bottom)_\n\n**Analysis**\n\nSince the end of May 2017, we have been monitoring a Monero miner that spreads using the EternalBlue Exploit (CVE-2017-0144). The miner\nitself, known as Smominru (aka Ismo [6]) has been well-documented [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [10], so we will not discuss its post-infection behavior.\nHowever, the miner’s use of Windows Management Infrastructure is unusual among coin mining malware.\n\nThe speed at which mining operations conduct mathematical operations to unlock new units of cryptocurrency is referred to as “hash power”.\nBased on the hash power associated with the Monero payment address for this operation, it appeared that this botnet was likely twice the size\nof Adylkuzz [9]. The operators had already mined approximately 8,900 Monero (valued this week between $2.8M and $3.6M). Each day, the\nbotnet mined roughly 24 Monero, worth an average of $8,500 this week (Figure 2).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2: Smominru Stats and Payments on the MineXMR mining pool_\n\nWe could also see that the average hash rate to date this year was quite high (Figure 3):\n\n_Figure 3: Smominru hash rate history on MineXMR_\n\n[At least 25 hosts were conducting attacks via EternalBlue (CVE-2017-0144 SMB) to infect new nodes and increase the size of the botnet. The](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-0144)\nhosts all appear to sit behind the network autonomous system AS63199. Other researchers also reported attacks via SQL Server [3], and we\n[believe the actors are also likely using EsteemAudit (CVE-2017-0176 RDP), like most other EternalBlue attackers. The botnet’s command and](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-0176)\ncontrol (C&C) infrastructure is hosted behind SharkTech, who we notified of the abuse but did not receive a reply.\n\nWith the help of abuse.ch [7] and the ShadowServer Foundation [8], we conducted a sinkholing operation to determine the botnet size and\nlocation of the individual nodes. The botnet includes more than 526,000 infected Windows hosts, most of which we believe are servers. These\nnodes are distributed worldwide but we observed the highest numbers in Russia, India, and Taiwan (Figures 4 and 5).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4: Geographic distribution of Smominru nodes_\n\n\n-----\n\n_gu e 5 Co ce t at o_ _o S_ _o_ _u_ _odes_ _o d_ _de_\n\nWe contacted MineXMR to request that the current Monero address associated with Smominru be banned. The mining pool reacted several\ndays after the beginning of the operation, after which we observed the botnet operators registering new domains and mining to a new address\non the same pool. It appears that the group may have lost control over one third of the botnet in the process (Figure 6).\n\n_Figure 6: Smominru adapting to the sinkholing and returning to two thirds of its hash rate with a new Monero mining address_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7: Smominru statistics and payments associated with their new mining address_\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCryptocurrencies have been used by cybercriminals for years in underground markets, but in the last year, we have observed standalone coin\nminers and coin mining modules in existing malware proliferate rapidly. As Bitcoin has become prohibitively resource-intensive to mine outside\nof dedicated mining farms, interest in Monero has increased dramatically. While Monero can no longer be mined effectively on desktop\ncomputers, a distributed botnet like that described here can prove quite lucrative for its operators.\n\nBecause most of the nodes in this botnet appear to be Windows servers, the performance impact on potentially critical business infrastructure\nmay be high, as can the cost of increased energy usage by servers running much closer to capacity. The operators of this botnet are\npersistent, use all available exploits to expand their botnet, and have found multiple ways to recover after sinkhole operations. Given the\nsignificant profits available to the botnet operators and the resilience of the botnet and its infrastructure, we expect these activities to continue,\nalong with their potential impacts on infected nodes. We also expect botnets like that described here to become more common and to continue\ngrowing in size.\n\n**Acknowledgement**\n\nWe would like to thank abuse.ch and ShadowServer for their help.\n\n**References**\n\n[1]
