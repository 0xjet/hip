The unified organization comprises at least four distinct groups,**\nincluding the Ghost Caliphate Section, Sons Caliphate Army (SCA), Caliphate Cyber\n**Army (CCA), and the Kalashnikov E-Security Team. Other groups potentially involved with**\nthe United Cyber Caliphate are the Pro-ISIS Media group Rabitat Al-Ansar (League of\n**Supporters) and the Islamic Cyber Army (ICA).[1]** Evidence does not support the direct\ninvolvement of the Islamic State leadership. It suggests external and independent\ncoordination of Pro-ISIS cyber campaigns under the United Cyber Caliphate **(UCC) name.**\n\n\n\n[2] [Investigations also display alleged links to Russian Intelligence group, APT28, using the](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APT28)\n\nname as a guise to wage war against western nations.[3][4]\n\n## Concerns\n\n\nThe group's actions have included online recruiting, website defacement, social media\nhacks, [denial-of-service attacks, and doxing with 'kill lists.'[5][6][7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack) The group is classified as\nlow-threat and inexperienced because their history of attacks requires a low level of\nsophistication and rely on publicly available hacking tools.[8][9]\n\nExperts raised doubts about the source and nature of data from released 'kill lists' containing\npersonal information about U.S. Military personnel claimed stolen from hacked U.S.\ngovernment servers. There is no evidence that the United Cyber Caliphate (UCC)\ncompromised U.S. systems. The data included public, unclassified, and often outdated\ninformation about civilians, non-U.S. citizens, and others built from old data breaches or web\nscraped data.[10][11]\n\n\nU.S., French, and German intelligence Investigated attacks following the French Television\nChannel TV5Monde hack and The U.S. CENTCOM Twitter attack. All three countries linked\nactions by the United Cyber Caliphate (UCC) to **[APT 28, a Russian intelligence group.[3][4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APT_28)**\n\n\n-----\n\n## History\n\nThe group first emerged in hacking operations against U.S. websites in January 2015 as the\n**Cyber Caliphate Army** **(CCA).[1]** In March 2015, the Islamic State published a \"kill list\" on a\nwebsite that included names, ranks, and addresses of 100 U.S. military members.[12]\n\n\nA pattern of similar attacks emerged after the media coverage. At least 19 individual 'kill\nlists,' including personal information of American, Canadian, and European citizens released\nbetween March 2015 and June 2016.[13] On April 4, 2016, all four groups united as the\n**United Cyber Caliphate (UCC).[14]**\n\nIn June 2016, the [Middle East Media Research Institute found and revealed to the media an](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East_Media_Research_Institute)\nalleged list of approximately 8,300 people around the world as potential lone-wolf attack\ntargets.[15]\n\n## Successful attacks since mid-2014\n\n\nAustralian airport website defaced.[16]\nFrench [TV5Monde live feed hacked, social media hacked and defaced with the](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV5Monde)\nmessage \"Je Suis ISIS\".[17] French investigators later discounted this, instead\n[suspecting the involvement of a hacking group, APT28, allegedly linked to the Russian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APT28)\ngovernment.[18]\nISIS hacks Swedish radio station and broadcasts recruitment song [19]\nUnited States' military database hacked in early August and data pertaining to\napproximately 1400 personnel posted online.[20]\nTop secret British government emails hacked. The emails pertained to top cabinet\nministers. The intrusion was detected by GCHQ.[21]\nFebruary 28, 2016, Caliphate Cyber Army (CCA) carried out the bizarre hack on the\nwebsite of Solar UK, a company in the historic town of Battle, England. Customers\nwere being diverted to a web page featuring the ISIS logo accompanied by a string of\nchilling threats. “Fear us,” the page warned. “We are the Islamic Cyber Army”.\nOn April 15, 2016 (Friday), Islamic State hackers under the name UCC successfully\nhacked 20 Australian websites in a coordinated attack on Australian business. Some of\nthe websites redirected to the website containing their content.[22]\nIn early April 2017, UCC released a kill list of 8,786 people.[23]\nIn mid 2019, Islamic State affiliated hacking group hijacked 150 targeted Twitter\nhandles using an unknown vulnerability.[24]\n\n## References\n\n\n1. ^ a b _[Alkhouri, Laith (2016). \"Hacking for ISIS: The Emergent Cyber Threat Landscape\"](https://fortunascorner.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Flashpoint_HackingForISIS_April2016-1.pdf)_\n\n_(PDF).
