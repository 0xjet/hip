This is an older malware that was previously connected to a](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/threat-encyclopedia/malware/trojan.win32.glupteba.ta)\n[campaign named Operation Windigo and distributed through exploit kits to Windows users. In 2018, a security company reported that the](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2014/03/18/operation-windigo-the-vivisection-of-a-large-linux-server-side-credential-stealing-malware-campaign/)\n[Glupteba botnet may have been independent from Operation Windigo and had moved to a pay-per-install adware service to distribute it in the](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/pop-up-ads-and-over-a-hundred-sites-are-helping-distribute-botnets-cryptocurrency-miners-and-ransomware/)\nwild. The activities of the actors behind Glupteba have been varied: they were suspected of providing proxy services in the underground, and\n[were identified as using the EternalBlue exploit to move into local networks and run Monero (XMR) cryptocurrency miners.](https://s.tencent.com/research/report/482.html)\n\nAfter looking into the recent variant of the Glupteba dropper delivered from the malvertising attack, we found that the dropper downloaded two\nundocumented components aside from the Glupteba malware:\n\nA browser stealer that can steal sensitive data, for example, browsing history, website cookies, and account names and passwords from\nbrowsers and send the information to a remote server.\n[A router exploiter that attacks MikroTik routers in local network with the CVE-2018-14847 vulnerability. It will schedule a task on the](https://blog.mikrotik.com/security/winbox-vulnerability.html)\nrouter for command and control (C&C) and upload the stolen administrator credentials to a remote server. A compromised router will be\nconfigured as a SOCKS proxy to relay malicious traffic, matching the original purpose of the Glupteba botnet on Windows.\n\nIn addition, an interesting feature we found inside the Glupteba dropper can retrieve the latest C&C domain from Bitcoin transactions. We\nexplain this feature further in the next sections. It seems the operators are still improving their malware and may be trying to extend their proxy\nnetwork to internet of things (IoT) devices.\n\n[Figure. 1](https://blog.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/migrated/security-intelligence-migration-spreadsheet/trendlabs-security-intelligence/2019/09/Glupteba-01.jpg)\n\n_Figure 1. Glupteba campaign attack flow_\n\n[Figure. 2](https://blog.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/migrated/security-intelligence-migration-spreadsheet/trendlabs-security-intelligence/2019/09/Fig-2.png)\n\n_Figure 2. Pop-up malvertising on file-sharing websites downloaded Glupteba dropper_\n\n**Analysis of the Glupteba dropper**\n\nThe downloaded dropper binary is packed with a custom packer, written in Go programming language, and compiled to executable. The\ndropper first initializes ‘config information’ by acquiring current application information, operating information, hardware information, as well as\nsome information hardcoded in binary. It creates a registry key HKEY_USERS\\<sid>\\Software\\Microsoft\\TestApp to store all the acquired\ninformation. The result of running the config initialization function is shown in the figure below.\n\n[Figure. 3](https://blog.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/migrated/security-intelligence-migration-spreadsheet/trendlabs-security-intelligence/2019/09/Fig-3.png)\n\n_Figure 3. Registries created by the Glupteba dropper_\n\nThen, the function sendParentProcesses acquires machine_guid from the registry, as well as distributor id and campaign id from the file name,\nproduct identification (PID), and names of parent processes. It then embeds this information in a POST request, encrypts it with an AES cipher,\nand uploads to the C&C server: hxxps://<server>/api/parent-processes.\n\nAfter that, the dropper checks if process is elevated and running as a SYSTEM user. If process is not elevated, it tries to exploit the fodhelper\nmethod to get it elevated. If it is elevated but not running as a SYSTEM user, it uses the “Run as Trusted Installer” method, likely inspired by\n[this code, which uses a stolen winlogon process token to run process as SYSTEM.](https://github.com/nfedera/run-as-trustedinstaller/blob/master/run-as-trustedinstaller/main.cpp)\n\n\n-----\n\ne a d oppe b a y as e bedded a e oot t d e s used o d g es a d p ocesses ( o 3 sys, o 6 sys,\nWinMonFs32.sys, WinMonFs64.sys, WinMonprocessmonitor32.sys, WinMonProcessMonitor64.sys, WinmonSystemMonitor-10-64.sys,\nWinmonSystemMonitor-7-10-32.sys, WinmonSystemMonitor-7-64.sys) and a few other tools taken from GitHub used to help installing the\n[necessary drivers (dsefix.exe and](https://github.com/hfiref0x/DSEFix) [patch.exe.) Function executeTask processes these main commands:](https://github.com/hfiref0x/UPGDSED)\n\nhide Hide task PID using embedded WinMon\n\nupdate Terminate and remove current version, replace with new version\n\ncleanup Uninstall\n\nFunction mainInstall checks for installed antivirus (AV) programs, adds firewall rules, and adds defender exclusions.\n\nFunction mainPoll regularly polls the C&C server for new commands. It sends a POST request to hxxps://<server>/api/poll. POST parameters\nlook like the following (before encryption):\n\nchallenge=e94e354daf5f48ca&cloudnet_file=1&cloudnet_process=1&lcommand=0&mrt=1&pgdse=0&sb=1&sc=0&uuid=&version=145&wup_\n\nThe query is AES 256-encrypted.\n\nFinally, function handleCommand implements backdoor functions.\n\n**Function** **Task**\n\nupdate\n\nget_app_name\n\nis_admin\n\nprocess_is_running Queries “SELECT Name FROM Win32_Process WHERE Name =”\n\nexec\n\ndownload\n\nrun\n\nrun-v2\n\nexit\n\nupdate Download and execute file\n\nupdate-data POST internal config to /bots/update-data\n\nupdate-cloudnet Download file from hxxp://nxtfdata[.]xyz/cl.exe, replaces cloudnet.exe file, which is Glupteba\n\nstop-wup Stop XMR mining\n\nstop-wupv Stop XMR mining\n\nstop-mrt\n\nnotify Establish heartbeat, notification to URL with a given time interval, notifyHTTP, notifyH, notifyG, notifyS, notifyTCP,\nnotifyTLS, notifyUDP\n\nnotify-host Host for notification\n\nevent-exists if Global\\\\<event name> exists\n\nmutex-exists if Global\\\\<mutex name> exists\n\nregistry-get-startup HKEY_USERS\\%s\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\n\nverify-signature Verify signature of PE file\n\n\nregistry-get-startupsignatures\n\nverify-processessignatures\n\n\nVerify signatures of PE files from startup\n\nEnumerate processes, verify signatures\n\n\nget-unverified-files Calls VerifyProcessesSignatures and RegistryGetStartupSignatures, reports unverified files\n\nget-stats-wup Query hxxp://localhost:3433/, GET cryptominer stats, wup.exe is the open-source miner for XMR\n\n\n-----\n\nupload-file File upload\n\nupdate-service Download and run service\n\nget-logfile-proxy Read file \\\\proxy\\\\t\n\ninstall Download and run file, sendInstallReport\n\nget-logfile-i2pd Read file \\\\i2pd\\\\i2pd.log\n\nsc Take screenshot\n\nupdate-cdn Update C2\n\ndiscover-electrum Use hardcoded Electrum wallet; read blockchain transaction data\n\n\ndiscoverblockchaincome\n\n\nUse hardcoded Bitcoin address, discover new C2 domain encrypted in bitcoin transaction data\n\n\n**Notable C&C update capability**\n\nThe backdoor mostly has standard capabilities, but one interesting feature stands out: This malware can update its C&C server address\nthrough the blockchain via the function discoverDomain.\n\nThe discoverDomain function can be run either by sending a backdoor command, or automatically by the dropper. DiscoverDomain first\n[enumerates Electrum Bitcoin wallet servers using a publicly available list, then tries to query the blockchain script hash history of the script with](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spesmilo/electrum/master/electrum/servers.json)\na hardcoded hash.\n\n[Fig 1](https://blog.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/migrated/security-intelligence-migration-spreadsheet/trendlabs-security-intelligence/2019/09/1-body.png)\n\nThis command then reveals all the related transactions.\n\n[Fig 2](https://blog.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/migrated/security-intelligence-migration-spreadsheet/trendlabs-security-intelligence/2019/09/2-body.png)\n\n[Then each transaction is parsed, searching for the OP_RETURN instruction.](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/OP_RETURN)\n\n[Fig 3](https://blog.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/migrated/security-intelligence-migration-spreadsheet/trendlabs-security-intelligence/2019/09/3-body.png)\n\nThe pieces of data followed by OP_RETURN instruction are then used as parameters for AES decryption routine — the first 12 bytes are used\nas the AES GCM tag, and the following 32 bytes are the encrypted data. The 32-byte long AES key is hardcoded in binary file.\n\n[Fig 4](https://blog.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/migrated/security-intelligence-migration-spreadsheet/trendlabs-security-intelligence/2019/09/4-body.png)\n\nTherefore, 0f8f7cd39e1a5231b49f986b877befce0c2f558f0c1a9844833ac702cb3eba6e gets decoded to venoxcontrol[.]com, which is the\ncurrent C&C server at the time of writing this publication.\n\nThis technique makes it more convenient for the threat actor to replace C&C servers. If they lose control of a C&C server for any reason, they\nsimply need to add a new Bitcoin script and the infected machines obtain a new C&C server by decrypting the script data and reconnecting.\n\n**Browser stealer component**\n\nOne observed component from the recent Glupteba variant is called “updateprofile”, which is a browser profile, cookies, and password\nextractor. The Chrome, Opera, and Yandex browsers are targeted — cookies, history, and other profile files are zipped and uploaded to the\ninformation collection server to path /api/log. Similar to the main dropper, this component is also written in Go, compiled to be executable, and\npacked with a UPX packer.\n\nAnother version of the browser stealer is called “vc.exe”. Its goal is to extract browser passwords and cookies and post the extracted data to\nthe information collection server to path /bots/post-en-data?uuid=.\n\n**Router exploiter component**\n\nAnother component we found downloaded by the Glupteba dropper is a router exploiter, which is also developed with Go language. It looks\ninto the default gateway of the victim’s network. The list of default IP gateways is obtained by calling WMI command “SELECT\nDefaultIPGateway FROM Win32_NetworkAdapterConfiguration WHERE IPEnabled = true”.\n\nIn addition to these addresses, the following three default addresses are added: 192.168.88.11, 192.168.0.1, 192.168.1.1.\n\nOnce the component successfully connects to the device listening on port 8291, it then attempts to exploit the device with the CVE-201814847 vulnerability, which affects the RouterOS system used on MikroTik routers. The exploit code was likely inspired by this code on exploitdb. It allows the attackers to grab the administrator’s credentials from unpatched routers. The grabbed account names and passwords are\nstored in a JSON object, encrypted, and POSTed to /api/router path of the C&C server.\n\n\n-----\n\ng 5\n\nOnce credentials are successfully obtained, a task is added to the scheduler of the router. There are three methods implemented to add a\nscheduler task: using WinBox protocol, using SSH, or using API.\n\n[Figure. 4](https://blog.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/migrated/security-intelligence-migration-spreadsheet/trendlabs-security-intelligence/2019/09/Fig-4.png)\n\n_Figure 4. Example of scheduled task added by Glupteba campaign to compromised MikroTik routers_\n\nThe router exploiter component scheduled a task named “U6” on compromised routers for command and control. The task will regularly check\na C&C URL every 10 minutes and execute the content downloaded from it. The C&C URL is appended with a unique UUID, which is the same\nas the bot ID of Glupteba on the victim’s machine. The URL usually returns an HTTP 404 error; but when the bot master sends a command, it\n[returns an RSC file, which is the format of the RouterOS configuration.](https://wiki.mikrotik.com/wiki/Manual:Configuration_Management)\n\nThe file is the command from the bot master to control the router. In the attack we analyzed, we saw the C&C server send multiple RSC files\nstep by step to configure the compromised router to be a SOCKS proxy. Here are the steps:\n\nThe first configuration changed the period of “U6” task schedule from 10 minutes to every 15 seconds.\n\n[Fig 6](https://blog.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/migrated/security-intelligence-migration-spreadsheet/trendlabs-security-intelligence/2019/09/6-body.png)\n\nThe second configuration disabled services, including winbox, telnet, api, and api-ssl. This is most likely to prevent the router from being\ncompromised by other attackers through the same vulnerability. Then it opened the SSH and SOCKS services, which are listening on\nrandomly assigned ports, and created a firewall rule to accept external connection to the SOCKS port.\n\n[Fig 7](https://blog.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/migrated/security-intelligence-migration-spreadsheet/trendlabs-security-intelligence/2019/09/7-body.png)\n\nThe third configuration removed the existing SOCKS access list on the compromised router.\n\n[Fig 8](https://blog.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/migrated/security-intelligence-migration-spreadsheet/trendlabs-security-intelligence/2019/09/8-body.png)\n\nThe fourth configuration added a new SOCKS access list to limit the service so that it only accepts connections from specified IP ranges.\nThese ranges are probably where the attackers’ servers are.\n\n[Fig 9](https://blog.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/migrated/security-intelligence-migration-spreadsheet/trendlabs-security-intelligence/2019/09/9-body.png)\n\n**Relayed traffic on compromised routers**\n\nAfter the above-mentioned setups, the compromised router became a SOCKS proxy for the attackers to relay traffic. We monitored a\ncompromised router to see what kind of traffic is transferred. The first remote connection routed through the SOCKS proxy is from a server,\nwhich likely belongs to the attackers. This server queries “http://ip-api[.]com/json”, which returns the IP address of the current SOCKS proxy\nserver. This query is sent repeatedly, probably to monitor the SOCKS proxy service.\n\nAfter the first check on the router status, we started seeing different servers with two types of traffic connected to the proxy. The first one is\n[spam traffic. We saw a remote server establish SMTP connections to different mail servers through the SOCKS proxy of compromised routers.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol)\nIf a mail server accepted the connection, that remote server started to send spam mail. The spam mail delivered seems to be related to the\n[notorious “Canadian Pharmacy” spam.](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2011/01/battling-the-zombie-web-site-armies/)\n\n[Figure. 5](https://blog.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/migrated/security-intelligence-migration-spreadsheet/trendlabs-security-intelligence/2019/09/Fig-5.png)\n\n_Figure 5. Example of spam traffic sent through a compromised router_\n\n[Figure. 6](https://blog.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/migrated/security-intelligence-migration-spreadsheet/trendlabs-security-intelligence/2019/09/Fig-6.png)\n\n_Figure 6. “Canada Pharmacy” website redirected from spam mail_\n\nBesides the spam traffic, we saw other traffic from a set of remote servers that were repeatedly connecting to Instagram. However, the traffic\nsent through was protected by HTTPS encryption. We can’t decrypt it and don’t know what exactly these connections are for. One theory is\n[that it is the password-reuse attack hitting Instagram. It was previously reported to be one type of malicious traffic proxied through the](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/03/22/glupteba-no-longer-windigo/)\nGlupteba botnet.\n\n[Figure. 7](https://blog.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/migrated/security-intelligence-migration-spreadsheet/trendlabs-security-intelligence/2019/09/Fig-7.png)\n\n_Figure 7. Example of Instagram connection (HTTPS-encrypted) relayed by a compromised router_\n\nAs mentioned, Glupteba still seems to be evolving and adding capabilities. New techniques, such as updating C&C servers through data\nobtained from Bitcoin transactions, show that the malicious actors behind this malware are adopting little-used techniques to try and keep their\nmalware active. Since it is already proven to be an information stealer and a proxy for malicious spam, users and enterprises should be wary\nof this threat.\n\n**Security recommendations**\n\n\n-----\n\na e t s g s a desp ead t eat t at ca a ect use s a d bus esses a e u t aye ed app oac to secu ty s po ta t o t e\ngateway, endpoints, networks, and servers.
