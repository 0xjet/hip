By comparison, the compilation date for the\nversion in Fortinet’s analysis is April 30, 2021.\n\nThe researchers noticed that Diavol ransomware collected basic information from the\ninfected system and generated a System or Bot ID that help the attacker track multiple\nintrusions from affiliates in the ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operation.\n\nDiavol ransomware’s Bot ID format includes the hostname, username, and Windows version\nof the compromised system, and a global unique identifier (GUID). The format is “almost\nidentical” to the one generated by TrickBot malware, the analysts note.\n```\n[hostname]-[username]_W[windows _version].[guid]\n\n```\n[A very similar Bot ID pattern has been seen with Anchor DNS, another piece of malware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/lazarus-hackers-use-trickbot-to-infect-high-end-victims/)\nattributed to the TrickBot gang, the researchers say in their report.\n\nThe victim IDs are important for malware operators because they can track the success of\nvarious campaigns and let affiliates know about it.\n\n“This is why these specific formatting and naming conventions could potentially point to the\n[group responsible for the initial deployment” - IBM X-Force](https://securityintelligence.com/posts/analysis-of-diavol-ransomware-link-trickbot-gang/)\n\nThe researchers also note that the HTTP headers for the command and control (C2) server\ncommunication were “set to prefer Russian language content,” also favored by TrickBot\noperators.\n\nAnother clue pointing to the Russian threat actors is code for checking the language on the\ncompromised system to filter out victims in Russia or the Commonwealth of Independent\nStates (CIS) region.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile Fortinet did not find this language check code in the Diavol ransomware sample they\nanalyzed, IBM says that they found indications in the development version that such code\n“may have been present or intended to be developed, even if it was not activated in the\ncompiled samples.”\n\n“A list of four-character hexadecimal strings was identified in the development sample. These\nstrings are unused within the compiled code but were recognized as potentially being\nlanguage code identifiers, and further analysis confirmed that all are related to Russian and\nCommonwealth of Independent States languages” - IBM X-Force\n\nGiven the different development stages in the two Diavol ransomware variants and when\nthey were found, it is clear that the malware is evolving.\n\nIBM X-Force did not find definitive evidence to tie Diavol ransomware to the TrickBot gang\nbut discovered new signs suggesting a connection.\n\nBut between their report and Fortinet’s finding that the malware functions in a very similar\nway as Conti, the attribution balance seems to tilt visibly towards TrickBot.\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n[Google exposes tactics of a Conti ransomware access broker](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/google-exposes-tactics-of-a-conti-ransomware-access-broker/)\n\n[New Bumblebee malware replaces Conti's BazarLoader in cyberattacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-bumblebee-malware-replaces-contis-bazarloader-in-cyberattacks/)\n\n[TrickBot cybercrime group linked to new Diavol ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/trickbot-cybercrime-group-linked-to-new-diavol-ransomware/)\n\n[The Week in Ransomware - May 20th 2022 - Another one bites the dust](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-week-in-ransomware-may-20th-2022-another-one-bites-the-dust/)\n\n[Conti ransomware shuts down operation, rebrands into smaller units](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/conti-ransomware-shuts-down-operation-rebrands-into-smaller-units/)\n\n[Ionut Ilascu](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/ionut-ilascu/)\n\nIonut Ilascu is a technology writer with a focus on all things cybersecurity.
