    "plain_text": "# Threat Actors Prey on Eager Travelers\n\n**[fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/threat-actors-prey-on-eager-travelers](https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/threat-actors-prey-on-eager-travelers)**\n\nJune 2, 2022\n\nSitting on a sunny beach full of sparkling sand. Exploring the jungle looking for exotic\nanimals and plants. Diving into a deep blue sea where sunlight has a difficult time reaching.\nPartying all night at clubs in a city you have never been to. Holding hands with friends\naround a campfire singing Kumbaya. Eating warm food and drinking coffee in a cave in a\nsnowy mountain.\n\nThose are some of what recently seemed to be unattainable travel fantasies that many\npeople around the globe have been dreaming of since Covid-19 started to rapidly spread in\nearly 2020. We’ve come a long way since then. Today, vaccinations and quarantining have\nled some governments to soften some of the regulations that have restricted how we live our\neveryday lives. Such eased regulations include eliminating travel restrictions so tourists can\nfill those delayed dreams.\n\n\n-----\n\nHowever, it s essential for eager travelers to understand that malicious actors are just as\neager to leverage that feeling of liberty to deliver malware. This blog will provide a few\nexamples of such attacks that FortiGuard Labs recently discovered.\n\n**Affected Platforms: Windows**\n**Impacted Parties: Windows users**\n**Impact: Controls victim’s device and collects sensitive information**\n**Severity Level: Medium**\n\n## Adversaries Pushing Unsanitary Itineraries\n\nItineraries are one of the must-haves for most travelers. Without one, they won’t know when,\nhow, and where to go, where to stay, and when and how to come home. An itinerary can also\nprovide details on how much time travelers have at the destination so they can plan\nactivities.\n\n### AsyncRAT\n\nFortiGuard Labs recently discovered a malicious file called “itinerary.zip” that was hosted on\ndc5b-163-123-142-137[.]ngrok[.]io.\n\nInside the archive file is a file entitled,\n“Itinerary.pdf_____________________________________________.exe”, which is really an\n.exe file disguised as a PDF. Hiding an .exe extension behind a long series of underscores is\na classic trick that threat actors have used for decades. The fact it is still being used today\nindicates that the trick still has some success. While we do not know how victims were\ndirected to the file, it’s an easy guess that a travel-related email or website was used to lure\nthe victims to the file’s location.\n\nRunning the .exe file installs AsyncRAT on the victim’s machine. AsyncRAT is an opensource Remote Access Trojan (RAT) written in .NET that has been used in a number of\nattacks. FortiGuard Labs has previously posted a blog on a spearphishing campaign that\ndelivered AsyncRAT:\n\n[Spear Phishing Campaign with New Techniques Aimed at Aviation Companies](https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/spear-phishing-campaign-with-new-techniques-aimed-at-aviation-companies)\n\nAsyncRAT provides remote access to attackers and allows them to remotely monitor and\ncontrol a compromised machine through a secure encrypted connection. The RAT’s features\ninclude keylogging, taking screenshots, and uploading and downloading files. This installed\nversion of AsyncRAT connects to its C2 servers located at “znets[.]ddns[.]net” and\n“dnets[.]ddns[.]net”. In an attempt to further hinder analysis, this AsyncRAT variant uses\nmultiple .NET obfuscators such as Xenocode, Babel, Yano, DotNetPatcher,\nCryptoObfuscator, Dotfuscator, SmartAssembly, Goliath, NineRays, and 198 Protector V2.\n\n\n-----\n\nFurther investigation revealed that itinerary.zip was not the only file hosted on dc5b-163-123142-137[.]ngrok[.]io. The files travel_details.iso, activities_and_dates.iso, and Itinerary.exe\nwere also on the same domain and they also install AsyncRAT variants that connect to the\nsame C2 servers.\n\nAn ISO file (often called an ISO image) is an archive file that contains the identical content\n(i.e. the folder and file hierarchy) of a physical disc such as a CD, DVD, or Blu-ray. ISO files\nused to require third-party software to open. However, the file type is now supported natively\nin Windows, starting in Windows 8. Unfortunately, this provides another infection method to\nthe attackers. Furthermore, the .iso file format avoids being tagged with the Mark-of-the-Web\n(MOTW). MOTW forces saved webpages to run in the security zone of the location the page\nwas saved from as a security measure. Files that are tagged with MOTW also usually go\nthrough additional safety checks, such as Microsoft Defender’s SmartScreen and various AV\nscanning engines. This variant of AsyncRAT hides itself inside the .iso file format to dodge\n[extra scanning and is a known technique.](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1553.005)\n\nOnce the ISO image is mounted (typically done by simply double-clicking it), the victim needs\nto manually run the exe file in the mounted ISO to get infected with AsyncRAT.\n\nAnother AsyncRAT sample, “Booking details.exe“, was observed in early February 2022. All\nof these samples have travel-themed filenames, which is a clear indication that the attacker\nspecifically targeted travelers.\n\nFigure 1. Files inside the mounted ISO images\n\n### Netwire RAT\n\nNetwire RAT is another malware being delivered via a travel-themed infection vector.\nFlight_Travel_Intinery_Details.js is a malicious file FortiGuard Labs recently came across.\nGiven the file was hosted on an oft-abused Discord CDN, combined with the filename, leads\nus to surmise that the malicious javascript was likely distributed through a link in an email or\nan attached document file associated with travel.\n\nThe javascript (.js) file eventually drops Update.exe, which is a variant of Netwire RAT that\nconnects to its C2 server at kingshakes1[.]linkpc[.]net. This C2 server appears to have been\nused by Netwire RAT since May 2021 at the latest. Netwire RAT is a commodity Remote\nAccess Trojan designed to work on Windows, OSX, and Linux. Just like AsyncRAT, Netwire\nRAT takes control of the compromised machine and performs malicious activities such as\ndata exfiltration and reconnaissance.\n\n## Colombian Military Under Attack\n\n### Quasar RAT\n\n\n-----\n\nAnother example of a travel-themed cyberattack arrived in what appears to be a\nspearphishing attack against a military organization in Colombia.\n\nThe email has “Solicitud de Reserva para Mayo 2022” (English translation: “Reservation\nRequest for May 2022”) as the email subject, with “RESERVA.ISO” as an attachment.\n\nFigure 2. Screenshot of the email with a malicious ISO file sent to a military organization in\nColombia\n\nThe message reads in English:\n\n_Good afternoon,_\n\n_I hope you are well._\n\n_I am [removed] from the Product Dept. of AMV Travel._\n\n_I would like to request a reservation for 5 rooms in which we will be staying for a week._\n_Please find attached the details of the reservation._\n\n_Thank you very much._\n\n_I am waiting for your reply to continue._\n\nWhile an ISO file was also used in this attack, the payload is a different Remote Access\nTrojan, “Quasar RAT”. The use of Quasar RAT is not surprising because this RAT has a\nhistory of being used for cyberespionage in number of targeted attacks reported in blogs\nfrom various security vendors. One such example is in a blog, “Uncovering New Activity By\nAPT10”, published by FortiGuard Labs in October 2019, where the APT10 threat actor group\ntargeted government and private organizations with Quasar RAT. Because the malware is an\nopen-source RAT and has been observed to have been widely used, CISA released\n[“Analysis Report (AR18-352A)” on Quasar RAT in February 2019.](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/analysis-reports/AR18-352A)\n\nQuasar RAT is an open-source commodity RAT. As such, it’s not a unique tool for threat\nactors to have in their arsenal. The RAT is advertised to run on various versions of Windows\nOS (Windows 10, Windows 8/8.1, Windows 7, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2019,\nWindows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 and Windows Server 2008). Older versions of\nQuasar RAT also work on older Windows OS versions. It supports features typical of Remote\nAccess Trojans. These include:\n\nKeylogging\nPassword recovery/stealing from common Web browsers and FTP Clients\nUpload/download & execute files\nCollect system information\nRemote desktop\nRegistry editor\n\n\n-----\n\nLike the AsynRAT attack, the Quasar RAT ISO file gets mounted when the ISO file is doubleclicked. The victim must then manually run the malicious executable file “RESERVA.exe” to\nstart the infection process.\n\nFigure 3. Malicious RESERVA.exe in the mounted ISO file\n\nThe installed Quasar RAT connects to the C2 server at opensea-userreward[.]serveusers[.]com (DDNS). Fortinet’s telemetry, as well as OSINT, did not observe\nany connections to the DDNS over the past three months. This could indicate that the attack\nwas unsuccessful.\n\nInterestingly, FortiGuard Labs also discovered another Quasar RAT sample that shares the\nsame resource section and the same C2 address. This sample was submitted from Hong\nKong the day after the malware that was sent to a Colombian military service became public.\nWhile no evidence could be gathered to connect the samples to a single threat actor, given\nthe similarities in the samples, it is possible that the same attacker targeted an organization\nin Hong Kong.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe attacks described in this blog are not complicated. All that is needed is for the victim to\nmanually run a plain executable file manually to get infected. What is unique is that for the\npast two years, most opportunities for travel and vacation were taken away due to COVID.\nAnd now that the liberty to travel is back, threat actors are exploiting the enthusiasm people\nhave to get out and explore again.\n\nAlways practice cyber security hygiene, and bon voyage!\n\n## Fortinet Protections\n\nFortiGuard Labs has AV coverage in place for the malicious file samples in this report as:\n\nMSIL/VRN.WN!tr\nMSIL/Injector.VRI!tr\nMSIL/Kryptik.YVP!tr\nMSIL/Agent.CJR!tr\nJS/Agent.OOU!tr\nW32/VBKrypt.C!tr\n\nFortinet customers are also protected from this malware through FortiGuard’s Web Filtering,\nFortiMail, FortiClient, FortiEDR, and CDR (content disarm and reconstruction) services.\n\nIn addition to these protections, Fortinet has multiple solutions designed to help train users to\nunderstand and detect phishing threats:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe [FortiPhish Phishing Simulation Service uses real-world simulations to help organizations](https://www.fortinet.com/products/phishing-simulation)\ntest user awareness and vigilance to phishing threats and to train and reinforce proper\npractices when users encounter targeted phishing attacks.\n\nWe also suggest that organizations have their end users go through our FREE NSE\ntraining: [NSE 1 – Information Security Awareness.
