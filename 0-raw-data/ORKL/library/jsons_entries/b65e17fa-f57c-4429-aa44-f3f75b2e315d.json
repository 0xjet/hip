This may involve the loss of critical data and consumer confidence, as well as profits\n\n\nCERT Australia is at the forefront of the Australian Government’s support in helping protect Australian\nbusinesses from cyber attacks, and providing assistance on request.\n\nThe annual survey is an important part of CERT Australia understanding the cyber threat environment, so\nwe can continue providing businesses with the best cyber security advice and support possible.\n\nFor example, findings from the survey indicate that the most vulnerable part of a business to cyber threat\nwas the internal network. This may include a range of system vulnerabilities, such as weaknesses in\nauthentication, unused and unpatched services, as well as insecure devices – all of which make it easier\nfor unauthorised access to the network.\n\nIf cyber criminals do gain access to a network, this leaves a business open for exploitation. One of the\nprimary ways to do this is through targeted emails, or ‘spear phishing’, reported as the main cyber\nsecurity incidents experienced.\n\nAnother interesting finding was that the main motivation for a cyber attack was deemed to be a competitor\nseeking commercial advantage. This aligns with the cyber threat of most concern to businesses, which is\ntheft or breach of confidential information or intellectual property.\n\nOne finding of potential concern is that businesses reported no compromises of mobile devices. Yet recent\nreports from leading IT security companies state there has been a large increase in mobile malware attacks.\n\nI encourage all businesses to read this report, note the range of vulnerabilities identified, and address\nthe areas for improvement.\n\nI would also like to thank the businesses that took the time to respond to the survey – it takes a partnership\napproach between business and government to boost Australia’s cyber resilience.\n\n\n-----\n\nISBN: 978-1-925118-22-3\n\n© Commonwealth of Australia 2014\n\nAll material presented in this publication is provided under a Creative Commons\nAttribution 3.0 Australia licence (www.creativecommons.org/licenses).\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this means this licence only applies to material as\nset out in this document.\n\nThe details of the relevant licence conditions are available on the Creative\nCommons website as is the full legal code for the CC BY 3.0 AU licence\n(www.creativecommons.org/licenses).\n\n**Use of the Coat of Arms**\n\nThe terms under which the Coat of Arms can be used are detailed on the It’s an\nHonour website (www.itsanhonour.gov.au).\n\n**Contact us**\n\nEnquiries regarding the licence and any use of this document are welcome at:\n\nCommercial and Administrative Law Branch\nAttorney-General’s Department\n3–5 National Cct\nBARTON ACT 2600\nCall: 02 6141 6666\n\nEmail: copyright@ag.gov.au\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Contents\n\n\n##### Contents\n\n\n###### Executive summary 2\n\n Table of trends – 2012 to 2013  5\n\n Introduction  6\n\n About the survey 7\n\n Respondents  8\n\n Cyber security measures 10\n\n Cyber security incidents 22\n\n Case study – compromised websites 26\n\n Case study – international assistance  32\n\n Reporting cyber security incidents 34\n\n Concerns about and responses to cyber threats 37\n\n About CERT Australia 44\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Executive summary\n\n\n##### Executive summary\n\n\n## The 2013 CERT Australia Cyber Crime and Security Survey was designed and conducted to obtain a better understanding of how cyber incidents are affecting the businesses that partner with CERT Australia\n\nThese are the businesses that form part of Australia’s systems of national interest, including\ncritical infrastructure. They underpin the social and economic wellbeing of the nation and deliver\nessential services, including banking and finance, communications, energy, resources, transport\nand water.\n\nThe findings from this survey build on the baseline data from the 2012 CERT Australia Cyber Crime\n_and Security Survey. The findings provide a more comprehensive picture of the current cyber_\nsecurity measures businesses have in place, the recent cyber incidents they have identified, their\nreporting of them, and their concerns about cyber threats.\n\nThe findings also identify potential vulnerabilities and areas where organisations can make\nimprovements to strengthen their cyber resilience.\n\nResponses were received from 135 partner businesses. Importantly, they are continuing to take\ncyber security seriously. This is essential for individual businesses and their clients, as well as\nthe industry sector, and the business community more broadly.\n\nOverall, organisations have good cyber security measures in place, including policies and standards,\nas well as a range of technologies and mitigation strategies. Of note, 79% of organisations report\nthey are implementing the Top 4 mitigation strategies released by the Australian Signals Directorate\n(ASD). However, the use of application whitelisting (one of the Top 4) as a mitigation strategy\nis relatively low.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt is important that strong cyber security measures are in place, as there has been an overall increase\nin the number of cyber security incidents identified by organisations – from 56 organisations in\n2012 to 76 organisations in 2013.\n\nMost of the incidents were in the form of targeted emails, followed by virus or worm infection\nand trojan or rootkit malware. This is consistent with the finding that respondents viewed cyber\nsecurity incidents to be targeted at their organisation, rather than random or indiscriminate.\n\nOf concern, 61% of organisations do not have cyber security incidents identified on their risk\nregister. This may be linked with the identified need for management and CEOs to improve their\nIT security skills and practices – and perhaps awareness.\n\nOf note, the number of organisations that chose not to report cyber security incidents to an outside\nagency has increased – from 44% in 2012 to 57% in 2013.\n\nResponses indicate that Australian businesses are yet to be convinced about the benefit of\nreporting, but also that many incidents are considered too minor to report.\n\nThis finding reinforces the need for CERT Australia and other agencies to actively promote the\nbenefits of reporting cyber security incidents.\n\n### Importantly, Business is\n# ‘Taking \n### Cyber security Seriously\n\n# ’\n\n\n### Importantly, Business is\n# ‘Taking \n### Cyber security Seriously\n\n# ’\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Key findings\n\n\nFindings from the survey reveal a range of concerns and potential vulnerabilities\n\n- 61% of organisations do not have cyber security incidents identified in their risk register\n\n- 13% of organisations using Windows XP did not have plans to migrate to other software\nbefore April 2014\n\n- only 27% of organisations had increased expenditure on IT security in the previous 12\nmonths – a decrease of 25% from 2012\n\n- 16% of organisations have no staff dedicated to IT security, and the majority (72%) of large\norganisations (200+ employees) only have small IT security areas (1-5 full time staff)\n\n- 42% of organisations with a physical presence in other countries do not consider the\ninternationally connected networks within their organisational IT security posture.\n\nAreas for improvement have also been identified\n\n- 95% of respondents think general staff need to improve their IT security skills and/or practices\n\n- 91% of respondents think management need to improve their IT security skills and/or practices\n\n- more than 60% of respondents think IT staff, the CEO and the board of directors need to\nimprove their IT security skills and/or practices\n\n- the main internal factors that contributed to cyber security incidents were staff errors and/\nor omissions (57%) and poor security culture (50%)\n\n- the main external factors that contributed to cyber security incidents were targeted attack\n(51%) and third party risks and/or vulnerabilities (49%).\n\n\n-----\n\n##### TRENDS – 2012 TO 2013\n\nThe following table provides the survey findings from 2012 and 2013 that are directly measurable.\nThese findings are referenced throughout this report.\n\n\n22% 56%\n\n52% 27%\n\n64% 83%\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Introduction\n\n\n##### Introduction\n\n\n## The 2013 Cyber Crime and Security Survey was conducted by Australia’s national computer emergency response team, CERT Australia (the CERT)\n\nThe CERT is the primary point of contact in the Australian Government for cyber security issues\naffecting major Australian businesses.\n\nThe CERT is part of the Commonwealth Attorney-General’s Department, with offices in Canberra\nand Brisbane. It is a trusted source of information and advice on cyber security issues. It is not a\nregulator, its services are free, and it does not compete with commercial services in the market.\n\nThe CERT also works in the Cyber Security Operations Centre, sharing information and working\nclosely with the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, the Australian Federal Police,\nand the Australian Signals Directorate.\n\nIn addition, it is part of the global network of CERTs in both business and government, and leverages\nthose relationships to protect Australian business.\n\nThese partnerships with government agencies and international counterparts mean the CERT\nis very well connected and informed, so it is best placed to help businesses protect themselves\nfrom cyber attacks.\n\nFrom late 2014, CERT Australia will be co-located within the Australian Cyber Security Centre\nwith other operational cyber security agencies.\n\nOne of the challenges the CERT faces is gaining a better understanding of the impact of malicious\nonline activity and how well businesses are placed to respond.\n\nWhile there are an increasing number of cyber crime and security incidents, the true extent of\nthese threats is difficult to determine.\n\nTo help understand what is happening on this front, the inaugural CERT Australia Cyber Crime\n_and Security Survey was conducted in 2012._\n\nAs the cyber picture is constantly changing, the CERT is conducting annual national surveys\nto look for trends over time. This assists the Australian Government to develop an informed\nunderstanding about cyber security issues affecting the nation.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### About the survey\n\n\n##### About the survey\n\n\n## The 2013 survey aims to build on the baseline findings from 2012 and form a\nmore comprehensive understanding of how cyber incidents are affecting the businesses that\npartner with the CERT.\n\nIn line with the 2012 survey, the 2013 survey aims to gain a picture of the\n\n    - business – general description\n\n    - current cyber security measures in place\n\n    - recent cyber security incidents identified, and\n\n    - reporting of cyber security incidents.\n\nAdditional questions were included in the 2013 survey to gain a more comprehensive understanding\nof each of the above categories. Further, the 2013 survey seeks to understand business concerns\nabout cyber threats.\n\nThe survey was produced and conducted by the CERT and was hosted online by WebSurvey. It\nconsisted of 26 questions, both closed and open ended.\n\nTo ensure the most accurate and informed responses were obtained, questions were asked to\nbe completed by the Chief Information Officer and/or an IT security officer in each organisation.\n\n\nRespondents were assured that all answers are anonymous.\n\n\n### CERT AUSTRALIA is gaining\n# ‘a better\n### understanding of the impact of malicious online activity\n\n# ’\n\n\n### CERT AUSTRALIA is gaining\n# ‘a better\n### understanding of the impact of malicious online activity\n\n\n-----\n\n##### R e s po n d e n t s\n\n\n##### R e s po n d e n t s\n\n\n#### Industry sector\n\n\nResponses were received from 135 organisations, from more than 12 industry sectors. The\ngreatest representation was from defence (24%), followed by energy (16%), banking and finance\n(13%), government (12%), and other (11%).\n\nNote\n\n    - ‘defence’ refers to defence contractors or members of the defence industry\nsecurity program (DISP)\n\n    - ‘government’ refers mostly to government-business enterprises (ie critical\ninfrastructure), and\n\n    - ‘other’ includes businesses in legal services, airport management, gaming/\nmedia and entertainment, and software development.\n\nFigure 1 provides a breakdown of the sectors\nthat responded to the survey.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Contract to government\n\nAround half the responding organisations (56%) contract or provide services to government.\nThese organisations may therefore be responsible for protecting their own information and\ngovernment information.\n\n#### Size of the business\n\nMost respondents (74%) were from large organisations (200+ employees), with 20% being from\nmedium sized organisations (20 – 200 employees), and 6% being from small organisations\n(less than 20 employees).\n\n### Respondents are aware of\n# ‘the need for \n### IT Security Staff to keep their skills and knowledge up to date ’\n\n\n### Respondents are aware of\n# ‘the need for \n### IT Security Staff to keep their skills and knowledge up to date\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Cyber security measures\n\n\n##### Cyber security measures\n\n\n## Cyber security involves the prevention and detection of the unauthorised access, use or impairment of an organisation’s network data or systems\n\nTo maximise cyber resilience, modern organisations layer security defences for their IT systems\nto reduce the chance of a successful attack. This concept is known as defence-in-depth and\nseeks to manage risk with multiple defensive strategies, so that if one layer of defence turns\nout to be inadequate, another layer will hopefully prevent a full breach.\n\nThe multiple defence mechanisms layered across an organisation’s network infrastructure\nprotect data, networks, and users. A well-designed and implemented defence-in-depth strategy\ncan help system administrators identify internal and external attacks on a computer system\nor network.\n\n#### IT security area\n\nResults indicate that 84% of responding organisations have IT security areas. Of those, 89% have\ninternal IT security teams, and 11% outsource their IT security.\n\nWhether internal or outsourced, 74% of the IT security areas are reportedly small (1 -5 full time\nequivalent staff), 5% are medium (5 – 15 full time equivalent staff) and 5% are large (15+ full\ntime equivalent staff).\n\nOf concern, 16% of respondents reported their organisation did not have an IT security area – with\nno staff dedicated to this role.\n\nAlso of note, most of the large organisations (72%) have small IT security areas.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### International presence\n\nFindings indicate that 65% of responding organisations are based solely in Australia, while 35%\nhave a physical presence in other countries.\n\nOf those with a physical presence in other countries, 42% do not consider the internationally\nconnected networks as part of their IT security posture.\n\nThis finding is of concern, as all organisations with a physical presence and IT network in other\ncountries need to consider internationally connected networks as part of their IT security posture.\n\n#### IT security policies\n\nOrganisations were asked what type of IT security policies they use.\n\nResults indicate that basic security policies are being applied by the majority of surveyed organisations.\n\nFor example, 94% deploy user access management, 90% have business continuity/disaster recovery\nplans, 87% use change control, 82% have automated system backups, 81% have documented\nstandard operating procedures, and 81% have an incident management or response plan.\n\nWhile the majority of organisations report they have these security policies, there are also areas\nfor improvement. For example, less than 60% of respondents use cryptographic controls, and\naround 50% of respondents have plans in place for the management of removable computer\nmedia, such as USB memory drives.\n\nIn addition, only 25% of respondents reported having a forensic investigation plan. These plans\nhelp monitor use of the IT systems, provide mechanisms to recover lost data, and provide ways\nto protect information on systems.\n\nFigure 2 provides a breakdown of security policies being used by responding organisations.\n\n\n-----\n\nuser access management\n\nbusiness continuity/disaster recovery plans\n\nchange controls\n\nautomated system backups\n\nincident management/incident response plans\n\ndocumented standard operating procedures\n\nmonitoring system access & use\n\nmalicious software response\n\nsystem auditing\n\nnetwork access control\n\nclock synchronisation\n\ncryptographic controls\n\nmanagement of removable computer media\n\nagreed security architecture\n\ndefined system availability standards\n\nforensic investigation plan\n\nother\n\n\n**Figure 2 – breakdown of security policies being used**\n\n**0%** **10%** **20%** **30%** **40%** **50%** **60%** **70%** **80%** **90%** **100%**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Comparison with the 2012 Cyber Crime and Security Survey results**\n\nThe 2013 findings are similar to those of the 2012 survey.\n\nIn 2012, the majority of organisations reported applying basic security policies. These included\nuser access management, system backups, documented standard operating procedures and\nexternal network access control.\n\nIn 2012, the areas for improvement also included having plans in place for the management of\nremovable computer media, using cryptographic controls and having a forensic plan.\n\nComparison of results does indicate some improvement in the application of IT security policies,\nwith an increase in the number of organisations using cryptographic controls (from 25% in 2012\nto 60% in 2013) and having a forensic plan in place (from 12% in 2012 to 25% in 2013).\n\n#### IT security standards\n\nWhen asked if their organisation uses external IT security standards or frameworks\n\n    - 83% of respondents reported ‘yes’\n\n    - 13% of respondents reported ‘no’\n\n    - 4% of respondents reported they ‘did not know’.\n\nOf the organisations that use external IT security standards or frameworks, most use ISO/IEC\n27001 (83%), followed by PCI DSS[1] (42%), ISO/IEC 3100 (29%) and vendor specific standards (27%).\n\nFigure 3 provides a breakdown of the external standards being used by responding organisations.\n\n1This is the IT security standard commonly used by organisations using credit card data.\n\n\n-----\n\n**90%**\n\n**80%**\n\n**70%**\n\n**60%**\n\n**50%**\n\n**40%**\n\n**30%**\n\n**20%**\n\n**10%**\n\n**0%**\n\n\n**Figure 3 – breakdown of external standards being used**\n\n**Comparison with the 2012 Cyber Crime and Security Survey results**\n\n\nThe 2013 findings differ in some respects from those of the 2012 survey.\n\nComparison of results indicates an increase in the application of IT security standards and frameworks.\n\nThere has been an overall increase in the number of organisations applying IT security standards\n(from 64% in 2012 to 83% in 2013), and a decrease in the number of organisations that do not\napply IT security standards (from 25% in 2012 to 13% in 2013).\n\nSpecifically, there has been an increase in the number of organisations using ISO 27001 – from\n50% in 2012 to 83% in 2013. This standard states it is mandatory for management to examine\ntheir organisation’s IT security risks to form a risk mitigation system, and to ensure that the\ncontrols applied are current for the needs of the business.\n\nThe number of organisations adhering to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard\n(PCI DDS) has also increased – from 20% in 2012 to 42% in 2013.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Risk register\n\nWhen asked if the threat factor of cyber security incidents had been identified in their organisation’s\nrisk register\n\n    - 39% of respondents reported ‘yes’\n\n    - 61% of respondents reported ‘no’.\n\nThis finding is of concern and indicates an area for improvement, as all organisations should\nfactor the risk of a cyber security incident into their business continuity planning.\n\nA risk register is used to record any and all identified risks, as well as incidents and analysis of\nmitigations. This provides IT security teams with a better understanding of the threat landscape,\nso they can develop stronger mitigation strategies to protect their systems.\n\nManagement within organisations also need to ensure that, to be truly resilient in relation to\nthe spectrum of risks that could affect their organisation, cyber security incidents have been\nfactored into the risk register, and appropriate measures are taken to mitigate those risks.\n\n#### IT security technologies\n\nOrganisations were asked what type of IT security technologies they use.\n\nMore than 90% of respondents reported using anti-spam filters, anti-virus software, traditional\nfirewalls (network based), physical access control, email attachment filtering, remote access\nVPNs, and operating system patch management.\n\nMore than 80% reported using password complexity rules, digital certificates, and web filtering/\ncontent inspection.\n\nMore than 70% reported using privileged account restrictions, and application patch management.\n\nMore than 60% also reported using internal network segregation, IDS/IPS (network based), multifactor\nauthentication (such as smart cards, tokens, biometrics), and traditional firewalls (host based).\n\nOnly 30% of respondents reported using application whitelisting (one of the Top 4 mitigation strategies).\nAs ASD states, implementing application whitelisting across an entire organisation can be daunting.\nAs a first step, ASD recommends deployment to high-value and often targeted employees such as\nexecutive officers and their assistants.\n\nFigure 4 provides a breakdown of the IT security technologies being used by responding organisations.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 4 – breakdown of IT security technologies being used**\n\n\nanti-Spam filters\n\nTraditional firewalls -network based\n\nphysical access control\n\nOperating system patch management\n\nremote access VPNs\n\nemail attachment filtering\n\npassword complexity rules\n\ndigital certificates\n\nweb filtering/content inspection\n\nprivileged account restrictions\n\napplication patch management\n\ninternal network segregation\n\nIds/ips - network based\n\nmultifactor authentication\n\ntraditional firewalls - host based\n\ncentralised logging and/or siEm\n\nfile encryption\n\nrole based access control (rbac)\n\nnetwork encryption\n\nlayer 7 or web application firewalls\n\nremovable media management\n\nids/ips - host based\n\napplication whitelisting\n\ndata loss prevention (dlp)\n\nother\n\n\n**0%**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Comparison with the 2012 Cyber Crime and Security Survey result**\n\nThe 2013 findings are similar to those of the 2012 survey.\n\nFor example, in 2012 more than 90% of responding organisations also reported using antivirus\nsoftware, spam filters and firewalls. More than 80% also reported using access control and\nvirtual private networks.\n\nWhile many organisations are using a range of IT security technologies, results from both 2012\nand 2013 indicate that some organisations need to strengthen their IT security by adopting a\ndefence-in-depth approach.\n\n#### IT security skills and training\n\nRespondents were asked about the IT security training and qualifications of the IT security staff\nin their organisation.\n\nResponses indicate that 79% of organisations have IT security staff with at least five years’\nexperience working in IT security.\n\nMore than 65% of organisations have IT security staff with tertiary level IT qualifications.\n\nAround 60% of organisations have IT security staff with either vendor certifications, vendor\nneutral certifications or who have participated in ad hoc courses.\n\nFindings indicate that 7% of organisations have IT security staff with no form of IT security\ntraining or qualification.\n\nRespondents were also asked if other staff in their organisation need to improve their IT\nsecurity skills and/or practices\n\n    - 95% of respondents reported this need for general staff\n\n    - 91% of respondents reported this need for management\n\n    - 66% of respondents reported this need for IT staff\n\n    - 63% of respondents reported this need for the CEO\n\n    - 62% of respondents reported this need for the board of directors.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Comparison with the 2012 Cyber Crime and Security Survey results**\n\nThe 2013 findings differ in some respects from those of the 2012 survey.\n\nComparison of results indicates an improvement in the IT security skills of IT security staff.\n\nFor example, there has been an increase in the number of IT security staff with vendor certifications\n(from 50% in 2012 to 60% in 2013) and at least five years’ experience working in IT security\n(from 35% in 2012 to 79% in 2013).\n\nHowever, these results also indicate that some organisations still need to improve the skill set\nof their IT security staff.\n\nComparison of results also indicates an increased need for all staff in organisations to improve\ntheir IT security skills and/or practices.\n\nFor example, an increase in this need was identified for general staff (from 70% in 2012 to 95%\nin 2013), management (from 70% in 2012 to 91% in 2013), and the board of directors (from 48%\nin 2012 to 62% in 2013).\n\nOf note, the 2013 survey also asked and identified this need for IT staff and CEOs.\n\n#### IT security expenditure\n\nWhen asked if their organisation had increased expenditure on IT security in the previous 12 months\n\n    - 73% of respondents reported ‘no’\n\n    - 27% of respondents reported ‘yes’.\n\nOf those organisations that had increased expenditure on IT security, the majority was on\ntechnical security controls (87%), followed by risk assessments (56%). Expenditure was also\nmade on IT security training (38%), consultants (38%) and additional IT security staff (13%).\n\nFigure 5 provides a breakdown of expenditure on IT security.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 5 – breakdown of expenditure on IT security**\n\n\n**90%**\n\n**80%**\n\n**70%**\n\n**60%**\n\n**50%**\n\n**40%**\n\n**30%**\n\n**20%**\n\n**10%**\n\n\n**0%**\n\n**Comparison with the 2012 Cyber Crime and Security Survey results**\n\n\nThe 2013 findings differ from those of the 2012 survey.\n\nOf concern, results indicate a large decrease in expenditure on IT security.\n\n\nThe number of organisations that increased expenditure on IT security decreased from 52% in\n2012 to 27% in 2013.\n\n\n-----\n\nSimilarly, the number of organisations that did not increase expenditure increased from 42%\nin 2012 to 73% in 2013.\n\nThe 2013 survey also asked how expenditure was increased, identifying it was mostly on\ntechnical security controls (87%).\n\n#### Australian Signals Directorate’s Top 4 strategies\n\nRespondents were asked if the IT security staff in their organisation are aware of the Top 4 of\nthe 35 strategies for mitigating cyber intrusions, released by ASD\n\n    - 79% of respondents reported ‘yes’\n\n    - 16% of respondents reported ‘no’\n\n    - 5% of respondents reported ‘don’t know’.\n\nImportantly, results also indicate that respondents who are aware of the Top 4, are implementing\nthese mitigation strategies\n\n    - 100% patch operating system vulnerabilities\n\n    - 98% minimise the number of users with administrative privileges\n\n    - 93% patch applications\n\n    - 23% use application whitelisting.\n\nThe Top 4 are mandatory for Australian Government agencies, and CERT Australia also advises\nbusinesses to use the strategies.\n\nThe findings indicate that few organisations use application whitelisting as a mitigation strategy.\nThis is consistent with the finding that only 30% of respondents reported using application\nwhitelisting as a type of IT security technology.\n\nAs noted earlier, implementing application whitelisting across an entire organisation can be\ndaunting – but it has significant benefits. As a first step, ASD recommends deployment to highvalue and often targeted employees such as executive officers and their assistants.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Windows XP – end of life\n\nWhen asked if their organisation uses Windows XP\n\n    - 47% of respondents reported ‘yes’\n\n    - 52% of respondents reported ‘no’\n\n    - 1% of respondents reported ‘don’t know’.\n\nWhen asked if their organisation is aware that technical assistance for Windows XP would no\nlonger be freely available after 8 April 2014\n\n    - 97% of respondents reported ‘yes’\n\n    - 2% of respondents reported ‘no’\n\n    - 1% of respondents reported ‘don’t know’.\n\nOf the organisations using Windows XP, the majority (79%) planned to migrate to other software\nbefore April 2014.\n\nOf concern, 13% of the organisations using Windows XP did not have plans to migrate to other software\nbefore April 2014, and 8% didn’t know if their organisation had such IT security plans in place.\n\nOrganisations that still use Windows XP after 8 April 2014 are at an increased risk of network\nvulnerability and compromise, as the software is no longer being supported or patched.\n\nAnecdotal reports indicate that cyber criminals have been ‘stockpiling’ new XP attacks, waiting\nfor support to end.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Cyber security incidents\n\n\n##### Cyber security incidents\n\n\n## Respondents were asked about the number and type of cyber security incidents identified on their networks in the previous 12 months\n\nRespondents were also asked about the origin and possible motives for the attacks, as well as\nwhy the attacks may have been successful.\n\nCyber security incidents were considered to be those that harmed the confidentiality, integrity\nor availability of a network’s data or systems.\n\n#### Number of incidents\n\nRespondents were asked if any cyber security incidents had been identified on their networks\nin the previous 12 months.\n\nResults indicate that 56% of organisations did identify one or more cyber security incident in\nthe previous 12 months, while 44% did not.\n\nThis finding may reflect that a number of cyber intrusions have gone undetected by some\norganisations, or that their definition of an incident is different. Anecdotal evidence available to\nthe CERT suggests that some businesses are unaware of the full scope of unauthorised activity\non their networks.\n\nFigure 6 provides a breakdown of the number of cyber security incidents identified by organisations\nin the previous 12 months.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Comparison with the 2012 Cyber Crime and Security Survey results**\n\nThe 2013 findings differ from those of the 2012 survey.\n\nResults indicate an overall increase in the number of cyber security incidents identified by\norganisations – from 56 organisations in 2012 to 76 organisations in 2013.\n\nThis result may indicate an increased awareness or improvement in the ability of organisations\nto detect cyber intrusions. It may also indicate a preference for organisations to anonymously\nreport experiencing cyber security incidents, such as through this survey.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Types of incidents\n\nOf the respondents who reported their organisation had identified cyber security incidents in\nthe previous 12 months, they assessed the main types were\n\n    - 63% - targeted emails\n\n    - 52% - virus or worm infection\n\n    - 46% - trojan or rootkit malware\n\n    - 35% - theft of mobile devices\n\n    - 26% - unauthorised access\n\n    - 17% - ransomware\n\n    - 17% - distributed denial of service\n\n    - 17% - unauthorised access to information from an insider.\n\nThese findings may help organisations decide where to place additional resources to protect their\ninformation assets.\n\nInterestingly, the main incident identified was targeted emails. These are socially engineered\nemails that are designed to assist an adversary in gaining a foothold on a network undetected,\nto extract valuable company or client information.\n\nSuch ‘spear phishing’ emails appear to be from a known source – but the links and attached files\nare designed to by-pass security and create an entry point onto a network.\n\nThis method is particularly effective in organisations where cyber resilience is not part of the\nculture – providing a timely reminder that all staff have a role to play in cyber security.\n\nAlso of interest – and concern – is that there were no reports of mobile devices being compromised\n– yet, recent reports from leading IT security companies state there has been a large increase in\nmobile malware attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7 provides a breakdown of the type of cyber security incidents identified by organisations\nin the previous 12 months.\n\n**Figure 7 – breakdown of the type of cyber security incidents**\n\nTargeted emails\n\nvirus or worm infection\n\ntrojan or rootkit malware\n\ntheft of mobile devices\n\nunauthorised access\n\ntheft or breach of confidential information\n\ndistributed denial of service attack\n\nransomware\n\nunauthorised access to information from an insider\n\ndenial of service attack\n\ndon’t know\n\nscareware\n\nunauthorised access to information from an outsider\n\nother\n\ntheft or loss of intellectual property\n\nunauthorised data modification\n\ncompromise of mobile devices\n\n**0%** **10%** **20%** **30%** **40%** **50%** **60%** **70%**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Comparison with the 2012 Cyber Crime and Security Survey results**\n\nThe 2013 findings are similar to those of the 2012 survey.\n\nIn 2012, the main types of incidents identified also included theft of a notebook, tablet or mobile\ndevices, virus or worm infection, trojan or rootkit malware, unauthorised access and denial of\nservice attack.\n\nThe 2012 survey did not identify or list ‘targeted emails’ as a type of incident.\n\n\n###### Case study – compromised websites\n\nCERT Australia regularly provides a range of Australian businesses with assistance in\ncleaning up compromised websites.\n\nIt is common for malicious individuals to compromise legitimate websites to facilitate\ncyber crime.\n\nThe compromises are often invisible to users, yet remain harmful to anyone viewing the\npage, including the owner of the website.\n\nFor example, a hacker may infect a website with obfuscated or disguised code, which can\ndownload and install malware that records keystrokes on visitors’ computers. The hacker\ncan then steal credit card numbers or login credentials for their email accounts, online\nbanking and cloud services.\n\nThe owner of a website is responsible for keeping it clean of malware. However, not all website\nowners are equipped with the technical knowledge and skill to keep their websites secure.\n\nFor example in late 2013, CERT Australia contacted a registered domain owner, to report\nthat a small business website had been compromised by malware.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Case study – compromised websites continued\n\nMalware (malicious software) is used to disrupt computer operation, gather sensitive\ninformation, or gain access to computer systems. It typically includes viruses, worms,\nspyware, and trojan horses.\n\nUnsure of how to remediate the website, the domain owner contacted the CERT\nAustralia hotline to discuss the issue and seek further advice.\n\nOne of CERT Australia’s technical advisors provided guidance on how to detect malicious\ncontent on the website, and also a step-by-step action plan on how to clean the website.\n\nThis case study highlights how CERT Australia assists Australian businesses in keeping\ntheir websites clean and secure, which helps protect the business, its customers and\nany visitors to the site.\n\n\n#### Apparent motives of incidents\n\nAttribution is always difficult. Where respondents think an attack may have come from, may\nnot be where it actually originated.\n\nMany respondents indicated they did not know the origin of the cyber security incidents experienced.\nOthers attributed the incidents to internal factors such as staff errors and/or omissions and a\npoor security culture, as well as external factors such as targeted emails.\n\nRespondents who reported their organisation had experienced cyber security incidents in the\nprevious 12 months were asked about the apparent motives or reasons for the attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn priority order, the main apparent motives were\n\n    - competitor seeking commercial advantage\n\n    - malicious damage\n\n    - using the system for further attacks\n\n    - personal grievance\n\n    - issue motivated/hacktivism\n\n    - other (including carelessness, lack of attention and negligence)\n\n    - don’t know\n\n    - illicit financial gain\n\n    - random or indiscriminate.\n\nThe main motive for attack – a competitor seeking commercial advantage – relates to the theft\nof intellectual property. There are a range of actors involved in this form of cyber crime – some\nbenefit directly, while others sell the information.\n\nWhatever the motive or reason for a cyber attack, it is important that an organisation understands\nenough about the incident to determine\n\n    - the vulnerabilities on their network\n\n    - what data may have been accessed, and\n\n    - what needs to be done to increase the protections of\ntheir network.\n\nFigure 8 provides a breakdown of the apparent motives or reasons for the cyber security incidents\nexperienced by organisations in the previous 12 months.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 8 – breakdown of apparent motives for cyber security incidents**\n\na competetitor seeking commercial advantage\n\npersonal grievance\n\nusing the system for further attacks\n\nmalicious damage\n\nother\n\nissue motivated/hacktivism\n\ndon’t know\n\nillicit financial gain\n\nrandom, indiscriminate attack\n\n**0%** **10%** **20%** **30%** **40%** **50%** **60%** **70%** **80%** **90%** **100%**\n\n**Comparison with the 2012 Cyber Crime**\n\n**and Security Survey results**\n\n\n**0%** **10%** **20%** **30%** **40%** **50%**\n\n\nThe 2013 findings are similar to those of the 2012 survey.\n\nIn 2012, respondents also viewed cyber security incidents to be targeted at\ntheir organisation, indicating a shift from previous views or conceptions that\nmost attacks are random or indiscriminate.\n\nWhether targeted or random, building organisational resilience to cyber\nsecurity incidents requires constant awareness and action.\n\n\n### CERT Australia assists\n# ‘Australian\n### businesses in keeping their websites clean and secure ’\n\n\n### CERT Australia assists\n# ‘Australian\n### businesses in keeping their websites clean and secure\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Contributing factors to the incidents\n\nRespondents were asked what internal factors may have contributed to the cyber security\nincidents identified by their organisation in the previous 12 months.\n\nThe main factors were staff errors and/or omissions (57%), followed by poor security culture\n(50%), unpatched or unprotected software (48%) and misconfigured systems, applications or\nnetwork devices (48%).\n\nLack of technical security controls (41%) and lack of IT security staff (22%) were also considered\nto be contributing factors.\n\nFigure 9 provides a breakdown of the internal factors that may have contributed to the cyber\nsecurity incidents experienced by organisations in the previous 12 months.\n\n\n**Figure 9 – breakdown of internal factors contributing to cyber security incidents**\n\n**60%**\n\n**50%**\n\n**40%**\n\n**30%**\n\n**20%**\n\n**10%**\n\n\n**0%**\n\n\n-----\n\nRespondents were also asked what external factors may have contributed to the cyber security\nincidents experienced by their organisation in the previous 12 months.\n\nThe main factors were targeted attack (51%), followed by third party risks and/or vulnerabilities\n(49%), sophisticated attackers (38%), powerful automated attack tools (36%) and volume of\nattacks (31%).\n\nFigure 10 provides a breakdown of the external factors that may have contributed to the cyber\nsecurity incidents experienced by organisations in the previous 12 months.\n\n**Figure 10 – breakdown of external factors contributing to cyber security incidents**\n\n\n**60%**\n\n**50%**\n\n**40%**\n\n**30%**\n\n**20%**\n\n**10%**\n\n**0%**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Comparison with the 2012 Cyber Crime and Security Survey results**\n\nThe 2013 findings are similar to those of the 2012 survey.\n\nIn 2012, the main contributing factors also included the use of powerful automated attack tools,\nunpatched or unprotected software, misconfigured systems, applications or network devices,\nsophisticated attackers, lack of technical security controls and poor security culture.\n\nIt is encouraging that businesses recognise both internal and external factors can contribute\nto cyber security incidents.\n\nThis highlights the need for organisations to have comprehensive cyber security measures in\nplace and to look out for a range of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n###### Case study – international assistance\n\nEarly in 2014, CERT Australia was contacted by a large Australian financial institution,\nrequesting assistance regarding three phishing websites.\n\nWhile the websites looked to be authentic, they were fraudulent. They were set up (most\nlikely by financially motivated cyber crime gangs) to look like the institution’s website in\norder to steal customer login credentials (usernames and passwords).\n\nOnce criminals have valid login credentials, they can hack into accounts and transfer\nfunds to other accounts. Many also sell the information to other cyber criminals.\n\nUnderstandably, the financial institution was keen to have the phishing websites taken down.\n\nAs the sites were hosted in a foreign jurisdiction, the organisation required assistance\nfrom CERT Australia, which has strong links with its international counterparts.\n\nCERT Australia confirmed that the phishing websites were still online and then contacted\nthe national computer emergency response team in the foreign jurisdiction, requesting\nthat the sites be taken down.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Case study – international assistance continued\n\nThe foreign national CERT reported the phishing websites to the relevant internet service\nproviders for action and remediation – and they were taken down.\n\nThis case study is a good example of how CERT Australia’s international partnerships\nhelp protect Australian businesses.\n\nAs Australia’s national computer emergency response team, CERT Australia participates\nin a number of international cyber security communities and has established cooperative\nagreements with a range of other national CERTS.\n\nFor example, CERT Australia has a direct working relationship with government, business\nand academic CERTS around the world, through the Forum for Incident Response and\nSecurity Teams (FIRST).\n\nCERT Australia is also a member of the International Watch and Warning Network (IWWN)\nand the Asia Pacific CERT (APCERT) Organisation.\n\n\n### CERT Australia’s\n# ‘international\n### partnerships help protect Australian businesses\n\n\n# ’\n\n\n### CERT Australia’s\n# ‘international\n### partnerships help protect Australian businesses\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Reporting cyber security incidents\n\n\n##### Reporting cyber security incidents\n\n\n## Respondents who stated their organisation had experienced cyber security incidents in the previous 12 months (56% of responding organisations) were asked about reporting the incident\n\n#### Reporting of incidents and to whom\n\nRespondents were asked if the cyber security incidents had been reported and if so, to whom.\n\nResults indicate that 57% of respondents did not report cyber security incidents\nto any outside agency, and 9% did not know if the incidents were reported.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Reasons for not reporting\n\nRespondents who did not report cyber security incidents were asked why. The main reasons were\n\n    - 44% - ‘there are no benefits of reporting’\n\n    - 44% - ‘other’\n\n    - 20% - ‘the attackers probably wouldn’t get caught &/or prosecuted’\n\n    - 16% - ‘did not know’\n\n    - 12% - ‘negative publicity for the organisation’.\n\n‘Other’ reasons for not reporting included that the incidents and the consequences were\nminor, and that the incidents were reported internally and managed by corporate policy.\n\n**Comparison with the 2012 Cyber Crime and Security Survey results**\n\nThe 2013 findings are similar to those of the 2012 survey.\n\nIn 2012, just under half the respondents had not reported cyber security incidents. Their reasons\nalso included there being no benefits of reporting, that the attacker probably wouldn’t get caught\nand/or prosecuted, and that the incidents were minor.\n\nComparison of results indicates a decrease in the number of organisations reporting cyber\nsecurity incidents to an outside agency – from 54% in 2012 to 34% in 2013.\n\nThese findings reinforce the need for the CERT and other agencies to actively promote the\nbenefits of reporting cyber security incidents.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe CERT works on a partnership and trust basis with business, and encourages the voluntary\nand timely reporting of cyber security incidents. This allows the CERT to form a more accurate\nview of cyber security threats and make sure that businesses receive the right help and advice.\n\nAll information provided to the CERT is held in the strictest confidence.\n\nTo report an incident, phone the hotline 1300 172 400 or email info@cert.gov.au\n\nThe CERT has also produced a one page guide for business, on investigating cyber security\nincidents. It outlines the key considerations and actions that businesses need to take, if a\ncyber security incident is to be investigated by law enforcement.\n\nThe guide is available at www.cert.gov.au/faq\n\n### These findings reinforce\n\n# ‘the need for\n\n### the CERT and other agencies to actively promote the benefits of reporting cyber security incidents.\n\n# ’\n\n\n### These findings reinforce\n\n# ‘the need for\n\n### the CERT and other agencies to actively promote the benefits of reporting cyber security incidents.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Concerns about and responses to cyber threats\n\n\n##### Concerns about and responses to cyber threats\n\n\n## All respondents were asked a series of questions about the cyber actors and threats of most concern to their organisation, and the responses to cyber threats they consider most important\n\nThis information aims to ascertain areas of future concern, to assist with understanding the\ntrending of cyber security incidents.\n\nThis information will also help the CERT in providing the most valuable services and advice to\nbusiness partners.\n\n#### Cyber actors of most concern\n\nIn terms of their organisation, respondents were asked which cyber actors concern them the most.\n\nThese are not necessarily the actors that have been involved in previous cyber security incidents\n– but are of future concern to organisations.\n\nThe main actors are\n\n    - 59% - issue motivated groups or hacktivists\n\n    - 54% - organised criminal syndicates\n\n    - 52% - trusted insiders\n\n    - 43% - individuals\n\n    - 42% - the intelligence services of some foreign governments\n\n    - 6% - other (included business competitors and disgruntled employees).\n\n\n-----\n\nThese findings indicate that issue motivated groups or hacktivists are of most concern.\n\nIf targeting critical infrastructure, these actors could cause significant harm and disruption,\nnot only to the organisation but to the broader social and economic wellbeing of the nation.\n\nWhile traditional attacks by this category of cyber actors has involved defacement and\ndistributed denial of service attacks, more recent activity has also involved domain name\nsystem (DNS) redirection.\n\nOrganised criminal syndicates and trusted insiders also rated highly as cyber actors of concern.\n\n\nFigure 12 provides a breakdown of the cyber actors of most concern to organisations.\n\n**Figure 12 – breakdown of cyber actors of most concern**\n\n\n**70%**\n\n**60%**\n\n**50%**\n\n**40%**\n\n**30%**\n\n**20%**\n\n**10%**\n\n**0%**\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Cyber threats of most concern\n\nIn terms of their organisation, respondents were asked which cyber threats concern them the most.\n\nThe main threats are theft or breach of confidential information (68%), unauthorised access (67%),\nunauthorised access to information from an outsider (65%) and unauthorised access to information\nfrom an insider (51%).\n\nThese threats are followed by theft or loss of intellectual property (48%), trojan or rootkit malware\n(47%), targeted emails (46%), unauthorised data modification (46%), virus or worm infection (43%)\nand theft of mobile devices (36%).\n\nThese findings indicate a range of cyber threats are of concern to organisations. Theft or breach of\nconfidential information and unauthorised access to information – from both insiders and outsiders\n– appear to be of most concern.\n\nInterestingly, targeted emails are of concern although perhaps not to the extent they should be, as\nfindings from this survey indicate this was the main type of cyber security incident experienced by\norganisations. A successful targeted email is often the precursor to theft or breach of confidential\ninformation and a number of other listed consequences of cyber threats.\n\nFigure 13 provides a breakdown of the cyber threats and consequences of most concern to organisations.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 13 – breakdown of cyber threats of most concern**\n\ntheft or breach of confidential information\n\nunauthorised access\n\nunauthorised access to information from an outsider\n\nunauthorised access to information from an insider\n\ntheft or loss of intellectual property\n\ntrojan or rootkit malware\n\nunauthorised data modification\n\nTargeted emails\n\nvirus or worm infection\n\ntheft of mobile devices\n\ndistributed denial of service attack\n\ndenial of service attack\n\ncompromise of mobile devices\n\nransomware\n\nscareware\n\nother\n\ndon’t know\n\n**0%** **10%** **20%** **30%** **40%** **50%** **60%** **70%** **80%**\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Vulnerable parts of organisations\n\nRespondents were asked which parts of their organisation are most vulnerable to cyber threats.\n\nThe main vulnerability reported is the internal network (51%), followed by externally facing systems\n(45%), public website (43%), mobile devices being compromised (35%), remote access (34%), mobile\ndevices being stolen (34%) and gateway environment (31%).\n\nThese vulnerabilities were followed by concerns about vulnerabilities in supervisory control and data\nacquisition (SCADA) systems (23%), partner networks (22%) and cloud (22%).\n\nFindings indicate that protecting an organisation’s internal network, or methods of accessing that\nnetwork is of paramount importance to the majority of respondents.\n\nAn internal network may have a range of system vulnerabilities, such as weaknesses in authentication,\nunused and unpatched services, as well as insecure routers and switches – all of which make it easier\nfor unauthorised access to the network.\n\nIf cyber criminals do gain access to a network, it is open for exploitation. This aligns with the finding\nthat targeted emails, or ‘spear phishing’, were the main cyber incidents experienced by organisations.\n\nInterestingly, mobile devices being compromised is considered a vulnerability. This is inconsistent with\nthe earlier finding, which indicates organisations did not experience this type of cyber security incident\n– refer to figure 7 (0% of mobile devices being compromised).\n\nThe findings also indicate that organisations have a range of cyber security vulnerabilities, highlighting\nthe need for comprehensive cyber security and risk management plans and procedures.\n\nFor example, while the vulnerability of SCADA systems was considered to be relatively low, the\nconsequences of a compromise to these and other industrial control systems may be severe – over\nand above that of other compromises.\n\nSCADA systems are used in much of the critical infrastructure that underpins essential services, such\nas those delivered by the water, electricity, communications, gas and transport sectors. They also\nperform major roles in the manufacturing and resource sectors.\n\nFigure 14 provides a breakdown of the parts of organisations most vulnerable to cyber threats.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 14 – breakdown of parts of organisations most vulnerable to cyber threats**\n\ninternal network\n\nother externally facing systems\n\npublic website\n\nmobile devices being compromised\n\nmobile devices being stolen\n\nremote access\n\ngateway environment\n\nscada\n\ncloud\n\npartner networks\n\nmanaged devices\n\ndata centre\n\nsupply chains\n\nother\n\n**0%** **10%** **20%** **30%** **40%** **50%** **60%**\n\n#### The most important responses to cyber threats\n\nRespondents were asked what they thought were the most important responses to cyber threats.\n\nThe main responses were senior leadership support (76%), training (72%), technical controls (64%),\nculture change (59%) and procedural controls (53%).\n\n\n-----\n\nThese were followed by intelligence sharing (50%), risk management processes (48%) and industry\ncollaboration (39%).\n\nThese findings indicate that an organisation’s social and behavioural responses, as well as technical\nresponses are important for cyber security.\n\nOf note, senior leadership support, training and culture change were identified as priorities.\n\n\nFigure 15 provides a breakdown of the most important responses to cyber threats.\n\n**Figure15 – breakdown of most important responses to cyber threats**\n\n\n**80%**\n\n**70%**\n\n**60%**\n\n**50%**\n\n**40%**\n\n**30%**\n\n**20%**\n\n**10%**\n\n**0%**\n\n\n-----\n\n##### About CERT Australia\n\n\n##### About CERT Australia\n\n\n## As Australia’s national computer emergency response team, the CERT works to ensure that all Australians and Australian businesses have access to information on how to better protect their information technology environment from cyber based threats and vulnerabilities\n\nThe CERT is the primary point of contact for cyber security incidents impacting on Australian networks.\n\nThe CERT is keen to highlight and reinforce the importance of business taking cyber security\nseriously. This not only means being aware of cyber threats but also putting effective controls\nand safeguards into practice. In Australia, it’s now publicly acknowledged that cyber operations\nare one of the most rapidly evolving threats to our national security.\n\nThe CERT encourages business to be prepared before an incident occurs. This involves a\nbusiness knowing its network, understanding the value of its information, and understanding\nhow both are protected.\n\nThe CERT also encourages business to understand what constitutes normal behaviour on its\nnetwork. By knowing this, the business is more likely to detect unusual behaviour.\n\nBeing prepared before an incident occurs also involves having operational relationships in\nplace with those who can assist, such as the CERT and law enforcement agencies. Having such\ncontacts already established helps with the efficient and effective sharing of information for\nprevention – and if necessary, mitigation.\n\nReporting incidents to the CERT is important. It allows the CERT to make sure that businesses\nreceive the right help – all information provided to the CERT is held in the strictest confidence.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe CERT is the entry point into government for Australian businesses. It works in the Cyber\nSecurity Operations Centre, sharing information and working closely with the Australian Security\nIntelligence Organisation, the Australian Federal Police, and the Australian Signals Directorate.\n\nIn addition, it is part of the global network of CERTs in both business and government, and\nleverages those relationships to protect Australian business.\n\nThese partnerships with government agencies and international counterparts mean the CERT\nis very well connected and informed, so it is best placed to help businesses protect themselves\nfrom cyber attacks.\n\nFrom late 2014, CERT Australia will be co-located within the Australian Cyber Security Centre\nwith other operational cyber security agencies.\n\nThe CERT is also a strong point of referral, which can lead to some very positive outcomes in\nterms of resolution and prosecution.\n\nAs such, the important messages for businesses are to\n\n    - continue taking cyber security seriously by implementing effective controls\n\n    - partner with the CERT before an incident occurs, and\n\n    - report cyber incidents to the CERT.\n\nTo report an incident\n\n    - call the CERT Australia hotline on 1300 172 499, or\n\n    - email info@cert.gov.au\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Guidance from the CERT\n\nBe prepared before an incident occurs.\n\nMake cyber security part of your risk management and resilience structures and planning.\n\nTrain your staff to use good cyber security practices as part of their daily work.\n\nThe CERT recommends\n\n    - patching applications and operating systems\n\n     - limiting the number of users with administrative privileges\n\n     - using multifactor authentication for critical systems, and\n\n     - using strong passwords/passphrases.\n\nThe CERT has also developed a publication on the top cyber security tips for small to medium\nbusiness – available at www.cert.gov.au/advice\n\nIn addition, it advises businesses to consider the 35 strategies for mitigating cyber intrusions\nreleased by ASD – refer to www.asd.gov.au/infosec/top35mitigationstrategies.htm\n\n#### Case studies\n\nThe case studies in this report provide examples of how partnering with government through\nthe CERT enhances the cyber security of Australian networks.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----",
