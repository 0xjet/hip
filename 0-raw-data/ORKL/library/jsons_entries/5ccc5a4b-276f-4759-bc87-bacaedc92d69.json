Since then, it showed a steady activity, encrypting and**\n**exfiltrating its victim’s data and threatening their victims to leak their information to**\n**pressure them into paying a ransom. Unlike other RaaS (Ransomware-as-a-Service)**\ndouble extortion groups, Vice Society focuses on getting into the victim system to\n**deploy ransomware binaries sold on Dark web forums. This is likely a way for this group**\nto save resources in developing its own ransomware.\n\nSEKOIA.IO investigations show they are currently leveraging the Zeppelin ransomware\ntargeting Windows systems, while HelloKitty samples were retrieved from their campaigns\ntargeting Linux systems at the end of 2021. We also believe the group representatives are\nEnglish native speakers.\n\n## Analysis\n\nThe Vice Society group mainly targets small or middle-sized companies in human-operated\n[double-extortion campaigns.](https://blog.sekoia.io/eternityteam-a-new-prominent-threat-group-on-underground-forums/)\n\nSince its launch and until mid-June 2022, the group claimed campaigns targeting at least 88\nvictims, all of whom are still listed on their dedicated data leak site (DLS).\n\nWhile some ransomware gangs refrain from targeting healthcare, government and education\norganisations, Vice Society was not observed applying such restrictions. This group notably\ntargets public school districts and other academic institutions, as 26.1% of the victims listed\non their data leak site are educational-related entities. The group also shows a strong focus\non the health sector.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1. Evolution of publicly disclosed ViceSociety ransomware attacks_\n\nWhen asked by BleepingComputer why it targets healthcare organisations, the group\nresponded with the following message: “Why not? They always keep our private data open.\n\n[…] they don’t even try to protect our data. They have billions of government money. […]\nUSA president gave a big amount to protect government networks and where is their\nprotection? Where is our protection? If the IT department doesn’t want to do their job we will\ndo ours and we don’t care if it is a hospital or university.”\n\n_Figure 2. Sectors most impacted by the Vice Society ransomware group_\n\n73.9% of known victims of this cybercriminal group are located in France, the United States\nof America, the United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, Germany and Brazil.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3. Countries most impacted by the Vice Society ransomware group, by increasing_\n_number of attacks_\n\nVice Society Data Leak Site onion displays an old style design and old HTML coding style, it\nis written in UK English language oftentimes showing a cynical sense of humour. We assess\nthis threat group possibly impersonates a British persona as part of their TTPs.\n\n_Figure 4. Samples of cynical messages published alongside victims’ leak_\n\nVice Society group operators leverage very common pentesters skills, as described by Talos\nin one of their report. Exploiting publicly available vulnerabilities (such as PrintNightmare) to\nperform remote code execution seems to be the most advanced technique the group has\nbeen observed using. Additionally, Vice Society does not resort to self developed\ncapabilities.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5. Vice Society ransom note left by a ransomware sample_\n\nBased on their ransom note, SEKOIA.IO found several samples embedding this note. While\nthe ransom notes evolved over time, their principal point of contact (vsociety[.]official@onionmail[.]org) and DLS remain the same.\n\n[Oldest samples from 2021 are HelloKitty ransomware for Linux (ELF binaries), and most](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fbi-hellokitty-ransomware-adds-ddos-attacks-to-extortion-tactics/)\nrecent ones (June 2022) are Zeppelin ransomware. The Zeppelin samples masquerade as\nlegitimate Windows processes and seem to be linked to the PrintNightmare vulnerability\nexploitation. They are customised for Vice Society (besides the ransom note) with the file\nencrypted extension using the format “.v-society.XXX-XXX-XXX”, which is consistent with\nother ransomware operators using the Zeppelin ransomware.\n\nThe Zeppelin ransomware is offered as a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) on several\nRussian-speaking cybercrime forums (such as XSS, BHF, DarkMarket, IFUD). The\nransomware developers behind Zeppelin goes under the name “buransupport” and its\npresence on several underground forums dates back to at least May 2019.\n\nOn 5 November 2019, the actors behind the “buransupport” moniker began to advertise a\nransomware variant called Zeppelin. At first, the goal was to share the builder in order to\nobtain some reviews of the new Zeppelin encrypter (based on the VegaLocker and Buran\nmalware).\n\nIn June 2021, “buransupport” was advertising an affiliate program for its “Offline ransomware\nZeppelin”.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6. Zeppelin offline crypto-locker advertisement on a cybercrime forum on 13 June_\n_2021_\n\nThe author of the publication describes the ransomware functionalities, including “a robust\ncrypto algorithm using global and session key + random file keys, scanning of all local drives\nand all available network paths, high speed, termination of some processes to release open\nfiles, possibility to encrypt files without extensions change”.\n\n“Buransupport” is still present and active on cybercrime forums, but no activity related to the\nZeppelin ransomware was reported in 2022.\n\nSEKOIA.IO assess that the Vice Society group is currently staying under the radar, likely as\na way to not attract Law Enforcement Agencies (LEA)’s attention and continue their activities\nin the long term.\n\nAs for the low number of ViceSociety related samples found in public repositories SEKOIA.IO\nassess it is possibly linked to the lack of cybersecurity resources of their main targeted\nverticals – healthcare and education. An other possible explanation, as described by Talos, is\nthat their Defensive evasion techniques (e.g. deleting security logs), limit the possibility of\ninvestigating during post-incident.\n\n## Vice Society ransomware IOCs\n\n**HelloKitty samples from end of 2021 (for Linux) with Vice Society ransom note:**\n```\n78efe6f5a34ba7579cfd8fc551274029920a9086cb713e859f60f97f591a7b04\n754f2022b72da704eb8636610c6d2ffcbdae9e8740555030a07c8c147387a537\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n**Recent samples (may 2022), using Zeppelin ransomware with the Vice Society ransom**\n**note.
