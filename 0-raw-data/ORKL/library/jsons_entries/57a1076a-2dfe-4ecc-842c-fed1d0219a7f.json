In the second half of 2020, the campaign improved its effectiveness by\nadopting dynamic DNS services and spreading messages with phishing URLs that infected victims with the fake Chrome\n[application MoqHao.](https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/android-banking-trojan-moqhao-spreading-via-sms-phishing-south-korea/)\n\nSince January 2021, however, the McAfee Mobile Research team has established that Roaming Mantis has been\ntargeting Japanese users with a new malware called SmsSpy. The malicious code infects Android users using one of two\nvariants depending on the version of OS used by the targeted devices. This ability to download malicious payloads based\non OS versions enables the attackers to successfully infect a much broader potential landscape of Android devices.\n\n## Smishing Technique\n\nThe phishing SMS message used is similar to that of recent campaigns, yet the phishing URL contains the term “post” in\nits composition.\n\n_Japanese message: I brought back your luggage because you were_\n_absent. please confirm. hxxps://post[.]cioaq[.]com_\n\n_Fig: Smishing message impersonating a notification from a logistics company. (Source:_ _[Twitter)](https://twitter.com/KEMSAN/status/1357535432813105153)_\n\nAnother smishing message pretends to be a Bitcoin operator and then directs the victim to a phishing site where the user\nis asked to verify an unauthorized login.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Japanese message: There is a possibility of abnormal login to your_\n\n_[bitFlyer] account. Please verify at the following URL: hxxps://bitfiye[.]com_\n\n_Fig: Smishing message impersonating a notification from a bitcoin operator. (Source:_ _[Twitter)](https://twitter.com/wadaonechan/status/1367349692611186695)_\n\nDuring our investigation, we observed the phishing website hxxps://bitfiye[.]com redirect to hxxps://post.hygvv[.]com. The\nredirected URL contains the word “post” as well and follows the same format as the first screenshot. In this way, the actors\nbehind the attack attempt to expand the variation of the SMS phishing campaign by redirecting from a domain that\nresembles a target company and service.\n\n## Malware Download\n\nCharacteristic of the malware distribution platform, different malware is distributed depending on the Android OS version\nthat accessed the phishing page. On Android OS 10 or later, the fake Google Play app will be downloaded. On Android 9\nor earlier devices, the fake Chrome app will be downloaded.\n\n_Japanese message in the dialog: “Please update_\n_to the latest version of Chrome for better security.”_\n\n_Fig: Fake Chrome application for download (Android OS 9 or less)_\n\n_Japanese message in the dialog: “[Important]_\n_Please update to the latest version of Google Play_\n_for better security!”_\n\n_Fig: Fake Google Play app for download (Android OS 10 or above)_\n\n\n-----\n\n[Because the malicious program code needs to be changed with each major Android OS upgrade, the malware author](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/10/behavior-changes-10)\nappears to cover more devices by distributing malware that detects the OS, rather than attempting to cover a smaller set\nwith just one type of malware\n\n## Technical Behaviors\n\nThe main purpose of this malware is to steal phone numbers and SMS messages from infected devices. After it runs, the\nmalware pretends to be a Chrome or Google Play app that then requests the default messaging application to read the\nvictim’s contacts and SMS messages. It pretends to be a security service by Google Play on the latest Android device.\nAdditionally, it can also masquerade as a security service on the latest Android devices. Examples of both are seen below.\n\n_Japanese message: “At first startup, a dialog_\n_requesting permissions is displayed. If you do not_\n_accept it, the app may not be able to start, or its_\n_functions may be restricted.”_\n\n_Fig: Default messaging app request by fake Chrome app_\n\n_Japanese message: “Secure Internet Security. Your device_\n_is protected. Virus and Spyware protection, Anti-phishing_\n_protection and Spam mail protection are all checked.”_\n\n_Fig: Default messaging app request by fake Google Play app_\n\nAfter hiding its icon, the malware establishes a WebSocket connection for communication with the attacker’s command\nand control (C2) server in the background. The default destination address is embedded in the malware code. It further\nhas link information to update the C2 server location in the event it is needed. Thus, if no default server is detected, or if\nno response is received from the default server, the C2 server location will be obtained from the update link.\n\nThe MoqHao family hides C2 server locations in the user profile page of a blog service, yet some samples of this new\nfamily use a Chinese online document service to hide C2 locations. Below is an example of new C2 server locations from\nan online document:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Fig: C2 server location described in online document_\n\nAs part of the handshake process, the malware sends the Android OS version, phone number, device model, internet\nconnection type (4G/Wi-Fi), and unique device ID on the infected device to the C2 server.\n\nThen it listens for commands from the C2 server. The sample we analyzed supported the commands below with the\nintention of stealing phone numbers in Contacts and SMS messages.\n\nCommand String Description\n\n通讯录 Send whole contact book to server\n\n收件箱 Send all SMS messages to server\n\n拦截短信&open Start <Delete SMS message>\n\n拦截短信&close Stop <Delete SMS message>\n\n发短信& Command data contains SMS message and destination number, send them via infected device\n\n_Table: Remote commands via WebSocket_\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWe believe that the ongoing smishing campaign targeting Asian countries is using different mobile malware such as\n[MoqHao,](https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/android-banking-trojan-moqhao-spreading-via-sms-phishing-south-korea/) [SpyAgent, and](https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/moqhao-related-android-spyware-targeting-japan-and-korea-found-on-google-play/) [FakeSpy. Based on our research, the new type of malware discovered this time uses a modified](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/fakespy-masquerades-as-postal-service-apps-around-the-world)\ninfrastructure and payloads. We believe that there could be several groups in the cyber criminals and each group is\ndeveloping their attack infrastructures and malware separately. Or it could be the work of another group who took\nadvantage of previously successful cyber-attacks.\n\nMcAfee Mobile Security detects this threat as Android/SmsSpy and alerts mobile users if it is present and further protects\nthem from any data loss.
