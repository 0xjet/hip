This is due to a large\n\nnumber of APT attacks against individual organizations and\n\nentire industries.\n\n� There were 11 very active groups. Their attacks targeted mostly\n\ngovernment institutions, industry, and finance.\n\n� Payment card information comprised a third of all data stolen\n\nfrom organizations (32%). This is 25 percentage points more than\n\nin the previous quarter. We believe the reason for this increase\n\nto be two-fold: the busy winter holiday purchasing season, plus\n\nthe progressively growing number of MageCart attacks coupled\n\nwith the second wave of attacks on Click2Gov.\n\n� Ransomware attacks are highly dangerous. The share of\n\nsuch attacks among malware infections was 36 percent for\n\norganizations and 17 percent for individuals (in the previous\n\nquarter, these were 27% and 7%, respectively).\n\n� A new trend in ransomware is to publish the stolen information\n\nif the victim refuses to pay up. We believe this is because more\n\nand more companies back up their data and have no need to\n\npay for decryption. Malefactors are adjusting accordingly, and\n\nnow threaten their victims with all the potential consequences of\n\ndisclosure of personal data, which is subject to the protections of\n\nthe European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Statistics\n\nIn the last quarter of 2019 the percentage of attacks aimed at data theft and attacks for direct financial\n\ngain remained practically the same as in the previous quarter.\n\n\n6% 1% 60%\n\n\n29% 2% 69%\n\n\n© Positive Technologies\n\nAccess to information\n\nFinancial profit\n\nHacktivism\n\nCyberwar\n\n\n33%\n\n\nin attacks in attacks\non organizations on individuals\n\nFigure 1. Attackers' motives\n\n\nIn the last quarter of 2019, payment card information made up a third (32%) of all information stolen\n\nfrom organizations. This is several times more than in the previous quarter (7%). This was to be expected.\n\nOn the one hand, people make a lot of online purchases in the run-up to the winter holidays. On the other\n\nhand, this jump is related to the rapidly growing number of MageCart attacks on thousands of online\n\nstores, combined with a second wave of attacks on the Click2Gov service used by many Americans to\n\npay their utility bills.\n\nThe percentage of attacks on individuals fell almost by half versus the previous quarter, and is now only\n\n10 percent of all attacks. Credentials make almost half (40%) of all data stolen from individuals, same\n\nas in the previous quarter. One of the common ways of tricking users into disclosing their credentials\n\nis a phishing email with link to a fake log-in page. But email security gateway can block the link, which\n\n[forces attackers to invent new schemes. For instance, instead of a link, they can attach an HTML file](https://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/Phishing+with+a+selfcontained+credentialsstealing+webpage/25580/)\n\nwhich is supposedly a payment document. If the user opens that file, JavaScript inside generates an\n\nauthentication form in the user's browser, without any suspicious redirections to a different site. When\n\nthe credentials are entered, the script sends the credentials to the attackers.\n\n\n7% 4% 1% 7%\n\n\n32%\n\n\n20% 16% 40%\n\n\n© Positive Technologies\n\nPayment card information\n\nPersonal data\n\nCredentials\n\nMedical records\n\nCorporate secrets\n\nClient databases\n\nPersonal correspondence\n\nOther\n\n\n11%\n\n\nin attacks in attacks\non organizations on individuals\n\n15% 23%\n\n24%\n\nFigure 2. Types of data stolen\n\n\nThe percentage of targeted attacks remains high. Two-thirds of attacks (67%) were targeted. Hackers\n\nattacked specific companies or an industry of interest. As a result, we see fewer attacks in the \"multiple\n\nindustries\" category (26 percent in early 2019 vs. 14 percent at year-end).\n\n\n-----\n\nThe list of the top five target industries remains stable: government, industry, healthcare, finance, and\n\neducation. At the same time, we see a two-fold increase in attacks on IT companies and retail. We will\n\ntalk about high-profile attacks of this kind later on.\n\nBlockchains became less popular as a target as the year went on, approaching just 1 percent. But this\n\ndoes not mean that cryptowallet owners are free from danger. For instance, the site of the Monero\n\n[cryptocurrency was compromised in the last quarter of 2019. Attackers uploaded malware masked as a](https://github.com/monero-project/monero/issues/6151)\n\nlegitimate cryptocurrency wallet.

Victim categories among organizations\n\nIn almost a quarter of cases (23%), the threat for individuals came from their mobile devices. Users make\n\nthings easier for attackers by downloading questionable software. In the last quarter of 2019, a number\n\n[of Apple users who wanted to jailbreak their devices fell victim to cybercriminals. When the checkra1n](https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/dhaub2/discussion_warning_there_is_a_fake_website_for/f3lovb4/)\n\nutility was released in fall 2019, it allowed using a hardware vulnerability to jailbreak all iPhones up to\n\niPhone X inclusive, as well as some iPads. Since checkra1n does not depend on the iOS version, this\n\n[jailbreak method rapidly gained popularity with both mobile users and security researchers. We advise](https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/analytics/mobile-application-security-threats-and-vulnerabilities-2019/)\n\n[against performing any kind of jailbreak since doing so weakens device protections against malware.](https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/analytics/mobile-application-security-threats-and-vulnerabilities-2019/)\n\n[Cybercriminals were fast to make use of the popularity of checkra1n. Cisco Talos researchers discovered](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2019/10/checkrain-click-fraud.html)\n\nthe fake website checkrain[.]com, which was used to distribute a mobileconfig file masked as checkra1n.\n\nWhen installed and launched, this file imitated the jailbreak procedure. Then users were informed that\n\nthey needed to download certain mobile apps to complete the procedure. Hackers used the fake\n\ncheckra1n to promote those apps and make more people download them.\n\n© Positive Technologies\n\n\n18% 5% 4% 73%\n\n\n23% 5% 3% 44%\n\n\nComputers, servers,\nand network equipment\n\nWeb resources\n\nin attacks in attacks Humans\non organizations on individuals IoT\n\nMobile devices\n\nPOS terminals and ATMs\n\n25%\n\nFigure 4.

In Q4 2019, victims included schools, medical\n\ninstitutions, industrial facilities, governments, and IT companies. The most aggressive ransomware\n\n[operators were Sodinokibi, Maze, Ryuk, and Bitpaymer. In Spain alone, at least three companies](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-attacks-hit-everis-and-spains-largest-radio-network/)\n\n[(consulting firm Everis, radio company Cadena SER, and manufacturing company TECNOL) fell victim](https://twitter.com/1ZRR4H/status/1201483886179565568)\n\nto the latter two groups.\n\nMore and more companies realize the threat of ransomware and are paying more attention to making\n\nbackups in case of an attack. As a result, ransomware operators have to keep thinking of new ways\n\nto make their victims pay the ransom. For instance, the operators of Maze copy sensitive data to their\n\nservers before encrypting it, and then threaten to disclose it to the general public unless the victim\n\n[pays up. Two such victims are Allied Universal, with a requested ransom of 300 bitcoins, and Southwire,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/allied-universal-breached-by-maze-ransomware-stolen-data-leaked/)\n\nwhose data was \"valued\" at 850 bitcoins. In both cases, the companies refused to pay the ransom, and\n\n[the attackers followed through on their threat. The files of both companies ended up on the web.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/maze-ransomware-publishes-14gb-of-stolen-southwire-files/)\n\n\n2% 10% 24%\n\n\n3% 2% 1% 7%\n\n9%\n\n\n36%\n\n\n2%\n\n9%\n\n\nin attacks in attacks\non organizations on individuals\n\n\n20% 22%\n\n7% 79%\n\n4%\n\n10%\n\n\n5%\n\n10%\n\n\n10%\n\n\n12% 14% 17%\n\n\n© Positive Technologies\n\nSpyware\n\nAdware\n\nBanking trojans\n\nRATs\n\nRansomware\n\nDroppers\n\nMultifunctional malware\n\nMiners\n\nOther\n\n© Positive Technologies\n\nEmail\n\nCompromised servers\nand workstations\n\nWebsites\n\nOfficial app stores\n\nChat and SMS messages\n\nFake updates\n\nOther\n\n\nFigure 8.

Malware distribution methods\n\n\n-----\n\nThe majority (79%) of malware infections at companies started with phishing emails. These emails can\n\nbe sent as a part of a mass attack or tailored to the target. Company-specific phishing emails usually\n\ncome from APT groups. As part of threat monitoring and research, the Positive Technologies Expert\n\n[Security Center (PT ESC) recorded attacks by such APT groups as TA505, Sofacy (APT28), Donot](https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/about/news/ta505-rising-to-become-worlds-most-dangerous-cybercriminal-group/?sphrase_id=70960)\n\n[(APT-C-35), Cloud Atlas, Bronze Union (LuckyMouse, APT27), Leviathan (APT40), Bisonal, Gamaredon,](http://blog.ptsecurity.com/2019/11/studying-donot-team.html)\n\n[SongXY, Cobalt, and RTM throughout the last quarter of 2019. Some of these groups send malicious](https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/analytics/cybersecurity-threatscape-q4-2017/?sphrase_id=70962)\n\ndocuments with very believable decoy texts. For instance, attacks by the Cloud Atlas group featured a\n\ntext in Russian about the geopolitical confrontation between China and the United States in the field of\n\nartificial intelligence.\n\nFigure 10. Fragment of document sent by Cloud Atlas\n\n###### Social engineering\n\nOftentimes, attackers manipulate people’s emotions to deliver malware. Emails are one way to accomplish\n\nthis. In Q4 2019, 54 percent of attacks used social engineering combined with malware. Users need to\n\nbe especially careful with their inboxes during the holiday season. Holidays are when attackers send\n\n[phishing emails most actively. For instance, prior to Thanksgiving in the U.S., attackers sent out emails](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/beware-of-thanksgiving-ecard-emails-distributing-malware/)\n\nwith supposed greeting cards. The attachments actually delivered malware, such as Emotet, to the\n\nvictims' computers. Mass emails with fake party invitations containing Emotet were also sent out at\n\n[Halloween and Christmas.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/emotet-trojan-brings-a-malware-scare-with-halloween-emails/)\n\nEven if you do not click suspicious links and do not open suspicious attachments, do not think you are\n\n[immune. In Q4 2019, hackers took advantage of the workings of the Microsoft OAuth API to perform](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/phishing-attack-hijacks-office-365-accounts-using-oauth-apps/)\n\nphishing attacks. The OAuth protocol allows issuing an access token to third-party apps without needing\n\nto know credentials. The attack went as follows. A phishing email contains a link to a file supposedly\n\non OneDrive or SharePoint. But after clicking the link and entering credentials, the user gets a form\n\nrequesting access to an Office 365 account. An inattentive victim can provide all requested rights with\n\na single click. And then attackers receive access to the user's contact list, files, and correspondence.\n\n\n-----\n\nExtortion emails are not a new trick, but they still\n\n[pay off well. For instance, Check Point estimates](https://www.zdnet.com/article/phorpiex-botnet-made-115000-in-five-months-just-from-mass-spamming-sextortion-emails/)\n\nthat operators of the Phorpiex botnet made about\n\n$115,000 in five months by sending such emails. As\n\nproof of compromise, attackers obtain their victims'\n\npasswords from breached databases and include\n\nthe passwords in the message. Payment for non\ndisclosure of sensitive data is usually in bitcoins.\n\n[However, Cofense points out that attackers have](https://cofense.com/new-phishing-sextortion-campaign-using-alternative-crypto-currencies-evade-detection/)\n\nstarted requesting payment in alternate currencies,\n\nsuch as litecoins (LTC). The reason is that messages\n\ncontaining bitcoin wallet addresses are often blocked\n\nby email security gateways precisely to prevent such\n\nextortion attempts. Some cybercriminals having\n\ntaken to putting bitcoin wallet addresses in emails in\n\n[the form of QR codes.](https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2019/12/24/sextortionists-return-for-christmas-price-goes-down-threats-go-up/)\n\n###### Hacking\n\n\n[Figure 11. Request from phishing app O365](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/phishing-attack-hijacks-office-365-accounts-using-oauth-apps/)\n[Access](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/phishing-attack-hijacks-office-365-accounts-using-oauth-apps/)\n\n\n[Vulnerability CVE-2019-0708 (also known as BlueKeep) is now being used in real attacks to deliver miners.](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-0708)\n\nHowever, we think that in the future this vulnerability could be used by hackers in other campaigns as\n\nwell, including APT attacks.\n\n[In October, Wallarm experts reported a vulnerability in PHP 7 (CVE-2019-11043) allowing execution](https://lab.wallarm.com/php-remote-code-execution-0-day-discovered-in-real-world-ctf-exercise/)\n\n[of arbitrary commands on nginx servers supporting PHP-FPM. Cloud storage company NextCloud,](https://php-fpm.org/)\n\n[whose clients were at risk, released guidance on how to protect against the new threat. However, not all](https://nextcloud.com/blog/urgent-security-issue-in-nginx-php-fpm/)\n\n[NextCloud administrators took security measures in time, and after a short while there were reports of](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-nextcry-ransomware-encrypts-data-on-nextcloud-linux-servers/)\n\nNextCry ransomware attacks. This malware targets and infects NextCloud servers vulnerable to CVE\n2019-11043. The vulnerability was new, so antivirus software could not detect the first NextCry attacks.\n\nThis enabled infection to occur.\n\nHacking can be used together with social engineering, as in the case of browser vulnerabilities. In\n\n[November, it was found that scammers were actively exploiting a vulnerability in Mozilla Firefox in](https://twitter.com/jeromesegura/status/1191856352429133824?ref_src=twsrc%5etfw|twcamp%5etweetembed|twterm%5e1191857500561104896|twgr%5e&ref_url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-tech-support-scam-attackers-use-this-firefox-bug-to-lock-up-your-screen/)\n\nattacks where they pretend to be technical support personnel. Users of the vulnerable browser were\n\nlured (such as by emails) to visit a hacker-controlled web resource. When the user visits, the browser\n\nis blocked with a pop-up window stating that the user must contact technical support or buy certain\n\nsoftware. The trick is not new, but it still works.\n\n###### Web attacks\n\n[Web resources remain a target for hacktivists. In the U.S. state of Ohio, hackers attacked an electronic](https://www.dispatch.com/news/20191126/ohio-election-day-cyber-attack-attempt-traced-to-panama)\n\n[voting system on election day, November 5, with an attempted SQL injection.](https://www.dispatch.com/news/20191126/ohio-election-day-cyber-attack-attempt-traced-to-panama)\n\nCorporate websites are also attractive to hackers. Attackers hope to obtain client databases, payment\n\ncard information, and credentials of site users. If the attackers succeed in stealing sensitive data, the\n\nvictim company has to notify the affected users and take measures to prevent further attacks. For\n\ninstance, a breach of personal data of online store clients forced smartphone manufacturer OnePlus\n\n[to launch a bug bounty program and partner with HackerOne. The breach was caused by a web](https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/were-opening-a-new-bug-bounty-program-and-partnering-with-security-platform-hackerone.1155756/)\n\n[vulnerability the details of which are still undisclosed.](https://www.zdnet.com/article/smartphone-maker-oneplus-discloses-data-breach/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Hackers can also use web vulnerabilities for denial of service (DoS) attacks. Cisco specialists reported](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2019/12/ASA-Bug-Attacked-In-The-Wild.html)\n\n[an increase in attempts to exploit vulnerability CVE-2018-0296 in the Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-0296)\n\nand Firepower Appliance firewall web administration interface. The vulnerability allows rebooting\n\nattacked devices remotely and without logging in, by sending specially crafted HTTP requests. It also\n\n[allows reading system information with directory traversal. The vulnerability was reported back in mid-](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html)\n\n2018, but remains a workhorse for hackers.\n\n###### Credential compromise\n\nAttackers search the Internet for accessible network devices with weak passwords to infect with malware\n\n[and add to their botnets for cryptocurrency mining or DoS attacks.

The\n\n[Muhstik botnet targets routers with Tomato firmware which have the default password \"admin\".](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/muhstik-botnet-attacks-tomato-routers-to-harvest-new-iot-devices/)\n\nThere are other ways for hackers to monetize credentials obtained in massive brute-force attacks. One\n\noption is to sell the data on the darkweb. But often attackers publish such databases for free. The owner\n\n[of one DDoS-for-hire service published a list of credentials for Telnet for over 515,000 servers, routers,](https://www.zdnet.com/article/hacker-leaks-passwords-for-more-than-500000-servers-routers-and-iot-devices/)\n\nand IoT devices on a hacker forum.

We described them in detail a year ago.](https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/analytics/cybersecurity-threatscape-2018-q4/)\n\nIn Q4 2019, these attacks occurred again. Authorities in eight cities stated that those who paid utility bills\n\nvia the service between late August and November were affected.\n\n[Figure 15. Geographic distribution of attacks on Click2Gov (yellow: first wave of attacks, blue: new wave of attacks)](https://geminiadvisory.io/second-wave-of-click2gov-breaches-hits-united-states/)\n\n\n-----\n\nGovernment institutions are still targeted by APT groups. In the last quarter of 2019, the Gamaredon\n\n[APT group remained active. In November and December, PT ESC registered 17 attacks by this group,](https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/analytics/cybersecurity-threatscape-2019-q3/)\n\ntargeting state institutions and military and defense-related organizations in Ukraine. The group now\n\nuses a different method of payload delivery. In their previous attacks, they sent documents with macros.\n\n[At the end of the year, though, they used template injection, which allows avoiding antivirus detection.](https://ired.team/offensive-security/initial-access/phishing-with-ms-office/inject-macros-from-a-remote-dotm-template-docx-with-macros)\n\nWith this method, the document does not contain OLE objects or macros. Instead, it contains a link to\n\na malicious template document automatically downloaded from the attackers' server. That documents\n\ncontains a macro that saves a malicious Visual Basic script (VBScript) to the startup folder. The\n\nmacro also modifies the registry value responsible for warning the user of macro execution. After this\n\nmodification, all macro documents will run automatically.\n\nFigure 16. Infection with template injection as used in Gamaredon attacks\n\nFigure 17. Documents from Gamaredon emails with embedded link to template document with macro\n\n\n-----\n\nIn December, PT ESC detected traces of three attacks on government institutions in Mongolia, South\n\nKorea, and Russia by the Bisonal group. Malicious emails from the group used RTF documents with an\n\n[exploit for vulnerability CVE-2018-0798. The documents were generated with builder 8.t, which is also](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-0798)\n\nused by other APT groups such as Goblin Panda, IceFog, and SongXY.\n\nFigure 18. Documents from emails by Bisonal\n\nThe SongXY group also attacks government institutions. PT ESC registered three attacks in Q4 2019:\n\ntwo on Ukrainian government institutions and one on Russian ones. Both Bisonal and SongXY used RTF\n\n[documents with an exploit for vulnerability CVE-2018-0798.

Attack targets Figure 23. Data stolen\n\nThe RTM group is still actively attacking industrial companies in Russia and the CIS. However, they also\n\nsend malicious emails to government institutions, banks, and scientific and educational institutions. PT\n\nESC detected 25 malicious mailings by the group during the fourth quarter. Starting in June 2019, RTM\n\nstarted calculating the server IP address with logical operations based on the amount of a transaction\n\nreceived by a certain Bitcoin wallet. In mid-December 2019, RTM changed the algorithm for obtaining IP\n\naddresses. Now every malware sample contains two Bitcoin wallet numbers, and the calculation is based\n\non the latest outgoing transactions from the first wallet to the second one. The change had a minimal\n\neffect on the group's code, but gave the attackers protection from spoofing of their C2 server addresses.\n\nFigure 24. Phishing message from the RTM group to an industrial company\n\nIn Q4 2019, APT attacks targeted industrial companies not only in Russia and the CIS, but also in\n\nthe United States, South Korea, Japan, Indonesia, Turkey, and Germany. Experts from Section 52 at\n\n[CyberX detected targeted attacks on industry in which attackers sent phishing emails for delivering the](https://cyberx-labs.com/blog/gangnam-industrial-style-apt-campaign-targets-korean-industrial-companies/)\n\nSepar infostealer. It is believed that Separ can be used to steal intellectual property and passwords for\n\naccessing industrial systems.\n\nThe APT33 group is also actively attacking industrial companies. This group makes heavy use of password\n\nspraying, in which they test multiple weak passwords in attacks on a large number of accounts. At\n\n[CyberwarCon, a Microsoft speaker presented findings from monitoring of the APT group. Experts say](https://www.wired.com/story/iran-apt33-industrial-control-systems/)\n\nthat in recent months the number of attacked organizations went down to 2,000, but the number of\n\naccounts the attackers tried to hack at each of these organizations increased dramatically.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Financial institutions\n\nMalware use\n\nSocial engineering\n\nHacking 3%\n\n\n© Positive Technologies\n\n94%\n\n94%\n\n\nOther\n\n\n6%\n\n0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100%\n\nFigure 25. Financial institutions: attack methods used in Q4 2019\n\n\nIn Q4, PT ESC detected 12 mailings from the Cobalt group to financial institutions.\n\nFigure 26. Phishing email from the Cobalt group\n\nThe group uses different types of malicious attachments,\n\nsuch as RTF documents with exploits, Microsoft Office\n\n[documents with macros, and VHD (Virtual Hard Drive)](https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/cert/2019/09/the-dangers-of-vhd-and-vhdx-files.html)\n\nfiles. The last one is a new format for Cobalt's malicious\n\nemails. It works only on Windows 7 and later. When the\n\nVHD file is opened, it is automatically mounted as a drive.\n\nThen Windows Explorer opens the malicious content, and\n\nall the user has to do is launch it. Payloads used by Cobalt\n\nin Q4 included CoolPlants, CobInt, COM-DLL-Dropper,\n\nand a JScript backdoor.\n\nFigure 27. Malicious VHD\nimage attachment\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 28. Document with embedded malicious macro\n\nThe TA505 group also attacks financial institutions. The attackers are not tied to any specific geographic\n\nlocation. According to PT ESC, in Q4 the group attacked financial institutions in the United States,\n\nColumbia, India, and the Czech Republic. Attachments to malicious emails from TA505 deliver the Get2\n\nloader, which in turn downloads the FlawedGrace and SDBbot backdoors, as well as the Snatch loader,\n\nto infected computers.\n\nFigure 29. Phishing email from TA505 to a Czech bank\n\nIn addition to financial institutions, targets of TA505 included IT companies, industry, and universities.\n\nBesides the malware mentioned already, the group still uses CryptoMix ransomware, EmailStealer\n\nmalware for filtering files by extension and stealing email accounts, a utility to disable Windows Defender\n\nand launch the payload, and a modified ServHelper backdoor. On top of that, TA505 has started using\n\nAZORult spyware.\n\nA new infostealer called Raccoon appeared on the darkweb in April 2019 and is rising in popularity. In\n\nQ4 2019, operators of Raccoon attacked employees of banks. To avoid detection by email systems,\n\n[attackers send phishing emails from a corporate account compromised earlier. In late October, emails](https://cofense.com/raccoon-stealer-found-rummaging-past-symantec-microsoft-gateways/)\n\ncontained a link to a malicious image hosted on Dropbox. Raccoon is distributed as MaaS (malware as a\n\nservice) for $200 a month. Developers update the malware regularly and add new features.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 30. Update announcement from Raccoon developers\n\n###### IT\n\nIn Q4, the percentage of attacks on IT companies increased to 8 percent of all attacks on organizations,\n\ncompared to 3 percent in Q3. Large IT companies are an attractive target for ransomware operators,\n\nwhich is hardly surprising. If an IT service provider is compromised, the provider will lose clients, who will\n\nbe concerned about infrastructure integrity. This danger is enough to make IT companies pay the ransom.\n\n© Positive Technologies\n\n\nMalware use\n\nSocial engineering\n\nWeb attacks\n\nHacking\n\n\n11%\n\n11%\n\n\n61%\n\n\n50%\n\n\nCredential compromise 7%\n\nOther\n\n\n14%\n\n\n14% 4% 82%\n\n\n0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100%\n\nFigure 31.

Data stolen\n\n\n-----\n\nThe General Data Protection Regulation states that personal data must be protected against unauthorized\n\n[or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage (integrity and confidentiality).](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-5-gdpr/)\n\nIn Q4 2019, we saw a new trend. Ransomware operators force their victims to pay the ransom by saying\n\nthat if the stolen personal data is disclosed, the company will pay much more under the GDPR. For\n\n[instance, CyrusOne, one of the largest American hosting providers, was attacked with ransomware](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ransomware-attack-hits-major-us-data-center-provider/)\n\n(presumably Sodinokibi). Attackers threatened to disclose the stolen data if the victim refused to pay.\n\nFigure 34. Announcement on the darkweb about attack on CyrusOne\n\n[IT companies, such as Synoptek and Complete Technology Solutions, were also hit by Sodinokibi in Q4.](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/12/ransomware-at-it-services-provider-synoptek/)\n\nAt the start of the quarter, hackers attacked the website of Extendware, a company that develops\n\nextensions for sites run on the Magento CMS. Attackers injected a keylogger into the sales pages.\n\n[Specialists believe this may be a supply chain attack. Hackers could have injected the malware not only](https://sansec.io/labs/2019/10/07/magento-plugin-vendor-compromised/)\n\ninto the Extendware site, but into the extensions as well. Such an attack could potentially compromise\n\n[all Extendware clients. In mid-2019, we already wrote about supply chain attacks against IT companies.](https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/analytics/cybersecurity-threatscape-2019-q2/)\n\nThis trend persisted throughout 2019, and will probably continue in 2020. Another example of a supply\n\nchain attack was seen against Volusion, an e-commerce platform developer. We will go in to greater\n\ndetail on the attack slightly later.\n\n###### Retail\n\n© Positive Technologies\n\nWeb attacks 50%\n\nMalware use 41%\n\nSocial engineering 36%\n\nCredential compromise 9%\n\nHacking 5%\n\n0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100%\n\nFigure 35.

Attack targets Figure 37. Data stolen\n\n[At the start of the quarter, hackers involved in attacks collectively referred to as MageCart compromised](https://twitter.com/jknsCo/status/1188770129217314816)\n\nSixth June, an online clothes store developed on Magento. Attackers injected a JavaScript sniffer (a\n\nscriptlet for stealing payment card information) into the site. To make the sniffer harder to detect, the\n\nhackers registered a domain name (mogento[.]info) that could be easily confused with that of Magento.\n\nThe fake web resource was used to distribute malicious components and receive the stolen payment\n\ncard information.\n\n###### What is MageCart?\n\nMageCart is a class of attacks on payment-enabled websites, such as online stores. MageCart is also\n\nused to refer to the hacker groups behind these attacks. In this attack, hackers compromise a site\n\nand inject a special JavaScript script (\"sniffer\") into the payment page. When a user enters payment\n\ncard information on the compromised site, the sniffer sends this information to the hackers' server.\n\nThese attacks are sometimes called web skimming.\n\nWeb skimming is so widespread now that different MageCart groups sometimes attack the same site\n\n[independently of each other. For instance, PerimeterX concluded that sniffers similar to those found in](https://www.perimeterx.com/blog/multiple-magecart-groups-attacking-simultaneously/)\n\nthe attack on Sixth June were installed on five other websites, including PEXSuperstore.com. Yet they\n\nalso found another sniffer at PEXSuperstore.com, presumably installed by a different group of attackers.\n\n[Same as in the previous quarter, there were MageCart supply chain attacks. For instance, one group](https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/analytics/cybersecurity-threatscape-2019-q3/)\n\n[compromised the Google Cloud storage of Volusion and injected a sniffer which was automatically pushed](https://www.zdnet.com/article/hackers-breach-volusion-and-start-collecting-card-details-from-thousands-of-sites/)\n\nto Volusion-based online stores. The estimated number of victims ranges from 6,500 to 20,000 sites.\n\nWhen compromising online resources and installing JavaScript sniffers, attackers do their best to evade\n\ndetection. For instance, in the case of Volusion, attackers used the domain name volusion-cdn[.]com\n\nto mask illegitimate data transfer as communication with Volusion servers. The same trick was used\n\nin attacks on Magento-based stores. Another trend in hiding JavaScript sniffers is to make their code\n\n[as small as possible. In Q4 2019, Malwarebytes detected attacks in which just a single line of code was](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/web-threats/2019/11/web-skimmer-phishes-credit-card-data-via-rogue-payment-service-platform/)\n\ninjected. That line downloaded a JavaScript sniffer from payment-mastercard[.]com, an address that\n\nbelonged to the attackers.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Figure 38. Link to a fake payment data input form injected into the compromised site](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/web-threats/2019/11/web-skimmer-phishes-credit-card-data-via-rogue-payment-service-platform/)\n\nIt was also found that the domain name payment-mastercard[.]com was involved in other attacks. That\n\ndomain was used to load a fake form for payment data input, imitating the input form of a legitimate\n\npayment service provider. After the user entered payment information into the phishing form, the data\n\nwent to the attackers' server, and the user was redirected to the original page of the provider.\n\nRetail companies must keep in mind that they can become victims of ransomware just like any other\n\n[industry. For instance, in Q4 2019 Arrigo Automotive Group lost $250,000 in this kind of attack.](https://heliontechnologies.com/2020/01/02/automotive-news-ransomware-is-an-escalating-problem-for-dealers/)\n\nAPT groups attack retail companies, too. For example, PT ESC detected APT attacks by the TA505\n\ngroup against retail companies in Japan.\n\nFigure 39. Email from TA505 to a Japanese retail company\n\n\n-----\n\n##### What companies can do to stay safe\n\n###### Use proven security solutions\n\n� Centrally manage software updates and patches. To prioritize update plans\n\ncorrectly, the most pressing security threats must be taken into account.\n\n� Install antivirus software with a sandbox for dynamically scanning files and the\n\nability to detect and block threats in the corporate email system, such as malicious\n\nemail attachments, before they are opened by employees. Ideally, antivirus software\n\nshould simultaneously support solutions from multiple vendors and have the ability\n\nto detect signs of hidden or obfuscated malware, as well as block malicious activity\n\nacross diverse data streams: email, web traffic, network traffic, file storage, and\n\nweb portals. Whatever solution you select, it should be able to check files both in\n\nreal time and retrospectively, by automatically re-scanning files when signature\n\ndatabases are updated to detect previously unknown threats.\n\n� We also recommend using SIEM solutions for timely detection and effective\n\nresponse to information security incidents. This will help identify suspicious activity,\n\nprevent infrastructure hacking, detect attackers' presence, and enable prompt\n\nmeasures to neutralize threats.\n\n� Automated tools for analyzing security and identifying software vulnerabilities.\n\n� Deploy web application firewalls as a preventive measure.\n\n� Detect sophisticated targeted attacks in real time and in saved traffic with deep\n\ntraffic analysis. Using such solutions will allow you to detect previously unnoticed\n\nattacks and monitor network attacks in real time, including use of malware\n\nand hacking tools, exploitation of software vulnerabilities, and attacks on the\n\ndomain controller. Such an approach quickly identifies attacker presence in the\n\ninfrastructure, minimizes the risk of loss of critical data and disruption to business\n\nsystems, and decreases the financial damage caused by attackers.\n\n� Employ specialized anti-DDoS services.\n\n###### Protect your data\n\n� Encrypt all sensitive information. Do not store sensitive information where it can\n\nbe publicly accessed.\n\n� Perform regular backups and keep them on dedicated servers that are isolated\n\nfrom the network segments used for day-to-day operations.\n\n� Minimize the privileges of users and services as much as possible.\n\n� Use a different username and password for each site or service.\n\n� Use two-factor authentication where possible, especially for privileged accounts.\n\n###### Do not allow weak passwords\n\n� Enforce a password policy with strict length and complexity requirements.\n\n� Require password changes every 90 days.\n\n� Replace all default passwords with stronger ones that are unique and meet strict\n\npassword policy requirements.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Monitor the security situation\n\n� Keep software up to date. Do not delay installing patches.\n\n� Test and educate employees regarding information security.\n\n� Make sure that insecure resources do not appear on the network perimeter.\n\nRegularly take an inventory of Internet-accessible resources, check their security,\n\nand remediate any vulnerabilities found. It is a good idea to monitor the news for\n\nany new vulnerabilities: this gives a head start in identifying affected resources and\n\ntaking necessary measures.\n\n� Filter traffic to minimize the number of network service interfaces accessible to an\n\nexternal attacker. Pay special attention to interfaces for remote management of\n\nservers and network equipment.\n\n� Regularly perform penetration testing to identify new vectors for attacking internal\n\ninfrastructure and evaluate the effectiveness of current measures.\n\n� Regularly audit the security of web applications, including source-code analysis,\n\nto identify and eliminate vulnerabilities that put application systems and clients at\n\nrisk of attack.\n\n� Keep an eye on the number of requests per second received by resources.\n\nConfigure servers and network devices to withstand typical attack scenarios (such\n\nas TCP/UDP flooding or high numbers of database requests).\n\n###### Help clients to stay safe\n\n� Improve security awareness among clients.\n\n� Regularly remind clients how to stay safe online from the most common attacks.\n\n� Urge clients to not enter their credentials on suspicious websites and to not give\n\nout such information by email or over the phone.\n\n� Explain what clients should do if they suspect fraud.\n\n� Inform clients about security-related events.\n\n##### How vendors can \n\n secure their products\n\n� All the measures described for organizations, plus:\n\n� Implement a secure development lifecycle (SDL).\n\n� Regularly audit the security of software and web applications, including source\ncode analysis.\n\n� Keep web servers and database management systems up to date.\n\n� Do not use libraries or frameworks with known vulnerabilities.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### How users can avoid falling victim\n\n###### Do not skimp on security\n\n� Use only licensed software.\n\n� Maintain effective antivirus protection on all devices.\n\n� Keep software up to date. Do not delay installing patches.\n\n###### Protect your data\n\n� Back up critical files. In addition to storing them on your hard drive, keep a copy on\n\na USB drive, external disk, or a backup service in the cloud.\n\n� Use an account without administrator privileges for everyday tasks.\n\n� Use two-factor authentication where possible, such as for email accounts.\n\n###### Do not use trivial passwords\n\n� Use complex passwords consisting of at least eight hard-to-guess letters, numbers,\n\nand special characters. Consider using a password manager (secure storage with\n\npassword generation feature) to create and store passwords securely.\n\n� Do not re-use passwords. Set a unique password for each site, email account, and\n\nsystem that you use.\n\n� Change all passwords at least once every six months, or even better, every two to\n\nthree months.\n\n###### Be vigilant\n\n� Scan all email attachments with antivirus software.\n\n� Be mindful of sites with invalid certificates. Remember that data entered on such\n\nsites could be intercepted by criminals.\n\n� Pay close attention when entering passwords or making payments online.\n\n� Do not click links to unknown suspicious sites, especially if a security warning appears.\n\n� Do not click links in pop-up windows, even if you know the company or product\n\nbeing advertised.\n\n� Do not download files from suspicious sites or unknown sources.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### About the research\n\nIn this annual report, Positive Technologies shares information on the most\n\nimportant and emerging IT security threats. Information is drawn from\n\nour own expertise, outcomes of numerous investigations, and data from\n\nauthoritative sources.\n\nFor the purposes of this report, any particular mass incident (such as a\n\nvirus attack in which criminals send phishing messages to a large number of\n\ntargets) is counted as one unique security threat. Terms used in this report:\n\n� A cyberthreat is a combination of factors and circumstances that create\n\nthe risk of information security compromise. In this report, we look at\n\ncyberthreats in terms of the actions of malefactors in cyberspace who\n\nattempt to breach an information system in order to steal money or\n\ndata, or with other intentions potentially causing harm to government,\n\nbusiness, or individuals. Attacker actions may be directed against the\n\ntarget company's IT infrastructure, workstations, mobile devices, other\n\nequipment, or at people as a factor in cyberspace.\n\n� A cyberattack consists of unauthorized actions targeting information\n\nsystems by cybercriminals leveraging techniques and software to obtain\n\naccess to information, impair the normal functioning or availability of\n\nsystems, or to steal, alter, or delete information.\n\n� An attack target is the target of unauthorized actions by cybercriminals.\n\nIn cases when social engineering is used to obtain information directly\n\nfrom an individual, client, or employee, the attack target is \"Humans.\" On\n\nthe other hand, when social engineering is part of an attempt to place\n\nmalware on corporate infrastructure or on the computer of an individual,\n\nthe attack target is \"Computers, servers, and network equipment.\"\n\n� Attack motive is the overall goal of cybercriminals. If an attack results in\n\ntheft of payment card information, the motive is \"data theft.\"\n\n� Attack methods are a set of techniques used to achieve a goal. For\n\ninstance, an attacker might perform reconnaissance, detect vulnerable\n\nnetwork services available for connection, exploit vulnerabilities, and\n\nget access to resources or information. For the purposes of this report,\n\nsuch a process is referred to as \"hacking.\" Credential compromise and\n\nweb attacks were placed in separate categories for greater granularity.\n\n� Victim categories are the economic sectors in which the attacked\n\ncompanies operate (or individuals, if the attack was indiscriminate with\n\nrespect to employer). For example, the \"Hospitality and entertainment\"\n\ncategory includes companies providing paid services, such as consulting\n\nagencies, hotels, and restaurants. The \"Online services\" category includes\n\nplatforms where users can fulfill their needs online, such as ticket and\n\nhotel aggregator websites, blogs, social networks, chat platforms and\n\nother social media resources, video sharing platforms, and online games.\n\nLarge-scale cyberattacks affecting more than one industry (most often,\n\nmalware outbreaks) have been placed in the \"Multiple industries\" category.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn our view, the majority of cyberattacks are not made public due to\n\nreputational risks. The result is that even organizations that investigate\n\nincidents and analyze activity by hacker groups are unable to perform a\n\nprecise count. This research is conducted in order to draw the attention of\n\ncompanies and ordinary individuals who care about the state of information\n\nsecurity to the key motives and methods of cyberattacks, as well as to\n\nhighlight the main trends in the changing cyberthreat landscape.\n\n#### Group profiles\n\nAPT-C-35 (Donot, SectorE02), active since 2016, attacks organizations in\n\nSouth Asia: Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, and\n\ncountries of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. The attackers take the\n\nguise of governmental institutions, military entities, and telecom companies.\n\nAPT28 (Fancy Bear, Sofacy), a cyberespionage group, has been active\n\nsince at least 2004. The group became widely known after a series of\n\nattacks in the leadup to the 2016 U.S. presidential elections. In 2017 and\n\n2018 the group attacked international organizations, military and defense\n\ncontractors, and government institutions in Europe and South America. The\n\ngroup uses a variety of tools, including some of their own making.\n\nAPT40 (Leviathan, TEMP.Jumper, TEMP.Periscope) has been known\n\nfor spyware campaigns since 2013. This group attacks transport and\n\ngovernment, science, education, and IT companies in Western Europe,\n\nNorth America, and Southeast Asia.\n\nBisonal is known for developing the malware of the same name. Its history\n\ndates back to 2014. The group attacks companies mostly in Russia, South\n\nKorea, and Japan.\n\nBronze Union, also known as TG-3390, LuckyMouse, APT27, or Emissary\n\nPanda, has been involved in cyberespionage attacks since 2010. To gain\n\na foothold on networks, the group often uses watering hole attacks: they\n\ntarget the websites frequented by targeted users and place malware on the\n\nwebsites in order to automatically infect visitors' computers. Currently the\n\ngroup targets governmental entities and companies involved in industry,\n\nmilitary manufacturing, energy, aerospace, and other high-tech fields\n\naround the world.\n\nCloud Atlas has been known since 2014 for their attacks on various\n\ncompanies in Russia, Central Asia, and Europe (especially Portugal).\n\nCobalt has been known since 2016 for its attacks on financial institutions.\n\nThe group started off by stealing from banks in CIS countries. Since 2017, it\n\nhas expanded its range of targets to include banks in Eastern Europe and\n\nSoutheast Asia. The group was named after Cobalt Strike, the penetration\n\ntesting software used by the group to develop attacks within target\n\nnetworks. Its primary method of breaching corporate networks is phishing\n\nmessages with malicious files in various formats: executable files, Microsoft\n\nOffice documents with macros or exploits, LNK files, and passworded\n\narchives containing executable files.\n\n\n-----\n\nGamaredon has been active since 2013. The attackers focus exclusively\n\non Ukrainian governmental entities: the C2 servers perform filtering\n\nby geographic region. In their attacks, the group uses a chain of scripts\n\nto download the Ultra VNC remote management utility to the victim's\n\ncomputer. They use a self-developed framework named Pteranodon for\n\nfull-fledged management of infected hosts. With it, the attackers can\n\ncollect information about the system and users, steal passwords, run scripts\n\nand commands, and exfiltrate information to remote servers.\n\nThe history of RTM dates back to 2016. The group attempts to access\n\ncorporate bank accounts and steal funds. They use phishing messages\n\nto obtain access to corporate networks. Since the very start, the group\n\nhas used a consistent format in such messages. Positive Technologies\n\ndata indicates that in 2018 alone, the group carried out 59 mailings, the\n\nrecipients of which included financial institutions. In 2019, the group moved\n\nto use of the Bitcoin blockchain. Most targets are financial institutions,\n\nalthough cases have also included industry, government, and IT-related\n\norganizations. In addition, the group has used .bit domains for some of their\n\nC2s. The .bit zone is powered by the Namecoin blockchain, which acts as\n\na censor-proof and confiscation-resistant alternative to traditional DNS\n\nregistrars. Experts at the PT Expert Security Center were able to use the\n\nblockchain architecture to devise an algorithm for monitoring registration\n\nof new domains by RTM and changes in their IP addresses. This enabled\n\nwarning financial institutions and the security community of new C2 servers\n\nin a matter of minutes (or sometimes even before) they entered use by the\n\nattackers.\n\nSongXY was discovered in 2017 by Positive Technologies experts. The\n\ngroup's victims include at least 17 companies from Russia, Japan, Mongolia,\n\nBelarus, the United States, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan,\n\nand Ukraine. The group attacks defense and industry. They use emails to\n\ndeliver Lurid and Gh0st malware that can steal data, take screenshots, and\n\nrecord audio from the victim's microphone.\n\nTA505 has operated since 2014. The group's targets include major financial,\n\nmanufacturing, transportation, and governmental entities in Canada, South\n\nKorea, the United Kingdom, the United States, and dozens of other countries.\n\nPhishing messages are the group's main method for penetrating target\n\nnetworks. With each new wave of attacks, the group has made qualitative\n\nchanges to its toolkit and advanced to more sophisticated techniques\n\nfor maintaining stealth. Since 2014, the group's arsenal has included the\n\n[Dridex banking Trojan, Neutrino botnet, and several families of ransomware,](http://blog.ptsecurity.com/2019/08/finding-neutrino.html)\n\nincluding Locky, Jaf, and GlobeImposter. Since spring 2018 the group has\n\nused the FlawedAmmyy remote access Trojan, and since late 2018, the new\n\nServHelper backdoor.\n\n\n-----\n\nAbout\nPositive Technologies\n\n\nPositive Technologies is a leading global provider of enterprise security solutions for vulnerability and compliance management,\nincident and threat analysis, and application protection.
