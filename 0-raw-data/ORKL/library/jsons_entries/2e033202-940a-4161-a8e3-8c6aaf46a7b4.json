They have also said ‘Nothing made by a human can avoid personal\nexpression’ (Hrant Papazian). Anomali Labs has conducted an in-depth study of the unique object dimensions present in\nweaponized RTF exploits used in phishing attacks. Through this research we have found that, like typographers, the\ndevelopers of malicious RTF weaponizers leave behind a unique fingerprint on the malicious phishing attachments they\ncreate. This fingerprint can be found in the unique height and width of the malicious objects present in a phishing\nattachment. So, if God can be found in the kerning, we, as threat researchers, believe that attribution is in the object.\n\n\n-----\n\nRTF files are among the most popular file formats used in phishing attacks today. Anomali Labs has tracked the unique\nobject dimensions present in 22 RTF exploits for CVE-2018-8570, CVE-2018-0802, CVE-2017-11882, CVE-2017-0199,\nCVE-2014-1761 and CVE-2012-0158 to gain insight into the adversary’s weaponization process. By identifying the height\nand width of malicious RTF objects and creating YARA signatures to track them, analysts have identified APT campaigns\nrelated to three distinct Chinese APT groups (Temp.Periscope, Temp.Trident and Goblin Panda), one South Asian APT\n(Sidewinder), and the cybercriminal campaigns of a known Pakistani APT group (Gorgon Group/Subaat). This paper will\ncover basic RTF object metadata structure, how this data, when unique, can be used to track threat actors, and an in-depth\ncase study of Chinese and Indian APTs utilizing a shared RTF phishing weaponizer to carry out diverse espionage\ncampaigns across Asia and Central Europe.\n\n## Exploit supply chain & the need for weaponizer attribution\n\nThe use of weaponized exploits in targeted phishing attacks continues to be among the most popular and effective\ntechniques observed by cybersecurity researchers today. The 2019 Verizon DBIR report cites ‘Email Attachment’ as the top\nmalware infection vector in incidents and reports that Office documents and Windows applications are the most common\ninfection vectors [1]. Among the Office documents utilized in cyber attacks, RTF file format is often used for phishing\nattachments and is regularly observed in espionage campaigns linked to prominent Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)\nadversaries. Rich Text Format (RTF) is a proprietary document file format created by Microsoft which has found popularity\nsince its creation in 1987. The ubiquity of RTF attachments in APT attacks has led researchers to conduct an in-depth\nanalysis of hundreds of weaponized RTF exploit files. This analysis has resulted in the development of a repeatable\nprocess for tracking the malicious files created by RTF phishing weaponizers and has introduced visibility into the threat\nactors’ supply chain for these weaponizer tools. Often, scripted phishing weaponizers will create malicious documents with\npredictable object dimensions for certain Common Vulnerability Exposures (CVEs). Based on these artifacts, it is possible\nto develop YARA detection signatures to allow analysts to study the spread and dissemination of phishing weaponizers\nacross the threat landscape. With this visibility into the weaponization phase of the cyber kill chain, researchers can\nunderstand the origination point of weaponizers, which is invaluable for threat actor attribution. Additionally, the ability to\ndetect and track these RTFs is highly advantageous to infosec organizations as it provides attack visibility during the\ndelivery phase of a potential intrusion.\n\nThis paper presents a new technique for attributing RTF weaponizers using object dimensions. Researchers have studied\nmore than 6,000 malicious RTF samples and have been able to group and attribute more than 27 different RTF\nweaponizers using object dimensions. An RTF weaponizer for CVE-2017-11882, CVE-2018-0802 and CVE-2018-0798,\ndubbed ‘Royal Road’, was discovered being used in espionage campaigns, and ultimately released into the commodity\nthreat landscape. Royal Road is believed to have originated amongst a group of Chinese APTs conducting espionage\ncampaigns from 2017 to 2019. In 2018, it was observed being used by the Indian APT actor Sidewinder, and in 2019 it was\nseen being adopted by cybercriminal actors. The diffusion of custom weaponizers like Royal Road, from exclusive usage\nby its developers or purchasers through to its ultimate emergence as a commodity tool, will be explored as a recurring\npattern which we refer to as the ‘Weaponizer Life Cycle’.\n\n## RTF exploitation\n\nRich Text Format was developed by Microsoft from 1987 until 2008, and remains supported by Windows, Mac and Linux\noperating systems. The RTF format was created to enable cross-platform document interchange. This file format has, for\nyears, been a popular target for vulnerability researchers and exploit developers because it can host different object types.\nThe object types include: annotations, fonts, pictures, OLE and SWF. This allows adversaries to deliver exploits from\ndifferent object types, often by attaching RTF files to phishing emails. The versatility of the RTF format for exploit delivery\nfrom different object types has given rise to the following popular CVEs:\n\nCVE-2014-1761\nCVE-2015-7645\nCVE-2016-4117\nCVE-2016-1019\nCVE-2017-0199\nCVE-2017-8570\nCVE-2017-11882\nCVE-2018-0802\nCVE-2018-0798\n\n\n-----\n\n## RTF tracking and attribution techniques\n\nThere are many aspects of RTF files that can be used to conduct analysis or track weaponized exploits for attribution\npurposes. In this paper we will focus on four specific techniques that can provide insight into both adversary operators and\nadversary supply chains. These four techniques include the tracking of RTF metadata, shellcode, obfuscation, encoding\nartifacts and object dimensions.\n\n### Metadata & author name\n\nIn addition to accommodating objects, RTF files can include metadata ‘Tag ID’ values that can be used to support threat\nactor attribution. Specifically, analysis of the metadata tag IDs for ‘author’, ‘company’, ‘operator (last modified by)’, ‘title’ and\n‘vern’ (internal version number) associated with RTF phishing attachments can provide string values that can be leveraged\nas indicators of compromise. These metadata tag IDs should be recorded and attributed to a threat actor if observed in\nmultiple campaigns over time, alongside additional overlapping IoCs or tactics techniques and procedures (TTPs).\nMetadata tag ID values can be observed in the strings of the RTF as well as through proprietary analysis tools such as\n_VirusTotal Enterprise in the description section of an uploaded malware binary. The tag values for author and operator_\nfields are derived from the machine used to create the RTF phishing attachment. In some instances, if the operator is using\nan application like Microsoft Office to create a weaponized phishing attachment, file compilation will apply the author value\nassociated with the operator’s application to the created malicious file. Additionally, a unique value for the ‘vern’ or internal\nversion number will be applied to all malicious phishing attachments created by that code base. The example shown in\nFigure 1 from the VirusTotal interface demonstrates a recurring metadata author value that was used by a CVE-2012-0158\nphishing weaponizer attributed to the Chinese Goblin Panda APT, also known as Conimes. This technique has been\nexplored at length in a SANS CTI Summit presentation on the topic [2].\n\nFigure 1:\n\nVirusTotal user interface showing RTF metadata author ‘Tag ID’ and strings.\n\nAlthough RTF metadata tag ID tracking is a useful method, over time, to develop attribution based on RTF attachments in\ntargeted campaigns, there are limitations to this technique. In many cases RTF metadata is fleeting and trivial to alter from\ncampaign to campaign. Often these values are updated to mimic regionally specific personnel at targeted organizations\nand changed to the native languages spoken by the targets. Additionally, RTF metadata tags are not mandatory values that\nmust be included upon the compilation of an RTF file. In some cases adversaries have removed RTF metadata tag IDs\nfrom weaponized RTF attachments upon updating a phishing weaponizer. Based on the inconsistent and non-essential\nnature of RTF metadata as a social engineering mechanism in weaponized RTFs, this tracking method provides the best\nvisibility, over multiple campaigns, of the operator’s personas and possible targeting intention, while being a fleeting\nindicator of compromise.\n\n### Shellcode\n\nCertain characteristics of the shellcode used to exploit a vulnerability targeted by a malicious RTF can be used to track\ncertain RTF weaponizers. The most common characteristic of shellcode would be certain Return Oriented Programming\n(ROP) gadgets being used by the exploit or the technique used to drop and execute the payload. While these\ncharacteristics are usually permanent and rarely changed, it is usually difficult to develop YARA rules to automatically track\nthem.\n\n### Obfuscation artifacts\n\nThe Office RTF parser and RTF file specification is very flexible from a development standpoint. One of the most flexible\nfeatures of an RTF file is the allowance of cascading objects, which can represent data in different formats and escape\ncharacters. Exploit developers make use of this functionality to build obfuscated payloads that are still valid when rendered\n\n\n-----\n\nin Office, but which can evade AV engines by representing malicious internal content in formats other than what is most\ncommonly used in AV static signature detection. This has the beneficial secondary outcome of making it harder for analysts\nto extract or analyse the malicious payload.\n\nActors often deploy scripts to insert custom obfuscation gadgets into their malicious RTFs. Using these gadgets as strings\nin YARA signatures is a very useful method for tracking RTFs created for certain campaigns or actors. There are multiple\narticles and papers discussing RTF obfuscation in detail [3, 4]. Figures 2 to 4 show some examples of RTF obfuscation\ngadgets that can be used to track malicious RTFs.\n\nFigure 2:\n\nObfuscation gadget present in Royal Road weaponizer version 2.\n\nFigure 3:\n\nExample of obfuscation gadget used in malicious RTFs.\n\nFigure 4:\n\nExample of obfuscation gadget used in malicious RTFs.\n\n### Object dimensions and phishing weaponizers\n\nCVEs and exploits are often purchased from digital black markets as Python scripts that can be used to weaponize a lure\ndocument. Alternatively, weaponizers have been known to be developed as internal tools for APT organizations. Based on\nthe popularity of Word for rendering email attachments, threat actors usually build their lure ‘.doc’ using a normal Office\napplication and then use the acquired script to inject the malicious RTF object into the lure document once it has been\ncreated.\n\nBased on RTF specifications, any object that has a graphical representation (which will most commonly be rendered in\n_Word) needs to specify the object dimension as part of the RTF object header. This is to say that the object height and_\nwidth for graphic representation are included in the strings of the compiled RTF file to ensure that an error will not occur\nwhen attempting to load the object. Table 1 includes a list of the object dimensions and attributes that can be included in an\nRTF object header at the time of compilation.\n\nObject size, position,\ncropping and scaling\n\n**\\objhN** **_N is the original object height in twips, assuming the object has a graphical representation._**\n\n**\\objwN** **_N is the original object width in twips, assuming the object has a graphical representation._**\n\n**\\objsetsize** Forces the object server to set the object’s dimensions to those specified by the client.\n\n|Object size, position, cropping and scaling|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|\\objhN|N is the original object height in twips, assuming the object has a graphical representation.|\n|\\objwN|N is the original object width in twips, assuming the object has a graphical representation.|\n\n\n-----\n\n**\\objalignN** **_N is the distance in twips from the left edge of the objects that should be aligned on a tab stop._**\nThis is needed to place Equation Editor equations correctly in line.\n\n**\\objtransyN** **_N is the distance in twips the objects should be moved vertically with respect to the baseline._**\nThis is needed to place MathType equations correctly in line.\n\n**\\objcroptN** **_N is the top cropping distance in twips._**\n\n**\\objcropbN** **_N is the bottom cropping distance in twips._**\n\n**\\objcroplN** **_N is the left cropping distance in twips._**\n\n**\\objcroprN** **_N is the right cropping distance in twips._**\n\n**\\objscalexN** **_N is the horizontal scaling percentage._**\n\n**\\objscaleyN** **_N is the vertical scaling percentage._**\n\nTable 1: Object dimensions and attributes that may be present in RTF header.\n\nIf the malicious RTF exploit object has a graphical representation (most phishing attachments do), the object dimensions\nare crafted inside the weaponizer script and included in the strings of the malicious RTF exploit. An extended study of\nmultiple RTF weaponizers and malicious RTF files targeting numerous vulnerabilities proved that the object dimension are\nvery often unique numbers. Specifically, the object height and width were frequently found to be unique and it was\nobserved that they never changed across the usage of certain weaponizers, even in instances when the weaponizer was\nbeing utilized by multiple actors deploying diverse shellcode. Whereas the RTF obfuscation and final delivered payload\nmay change, the RTF object dimensions were found to remain constant.\n\nInterestingly, RTF object dimensions are rarely used by anti-virus (AV) engines to detect malicious RTF files. This current\nlack of object dimension-based detection may be why developers do not need to change object dimension to bypass AV\nengines. On the other hand, metadata, obfuscation and shellcode (all used in other attribution techniques) tend to be\nchanged regularly by actors attempting to bypass AV detection. We noticed in multiple cases that, even when the actors\nwere very successful in updating their weaponizer to provide better AV detection evasion, a simple YARA rule tracking the\nobject dimension was able to find the malicious RTF created by a new version of the weaponizer. Figure 5, is the strings\nsection from a malicious RTF sample created by the Royal Road RTF weaponizer. We successfully tracked samples\ncreated by this weaponizer via a YARA rule to detect the unique object dimensions. The static AV detections in VirusTotal,\nwhich are shown in Figure 6, failed to detect many of these samples with accuracy. Specifically, in the sample included in\nFigure 6, only one AV engine identified the sample as an exploit for CVE-2017-11882. Adversaries were likely able to\nevade AV detection by manipulating the shellcode and employing updated obfuscation techniques. The use of YARA\nsignatures to detect object dimensions for phishing weaponizers provides researchers with a way to identify malicious\nRTFs that is independent of adversary obfuscation attempts.\n\nFigure 5:\n\nObject dimension strings from a Royal Road version 2 sample.\n\n|\\objtransyN|N is the distance in twips the objects should be moved vertically with respect to the baseline.

Of the over 6,000 malicious RTF files analysed, 4,445 contained unique object dimensions.\nThis demonstrates how distinct object dimensions are per weaponized RTF sample and reinforces that a cluster of shared\nobject dimensions between samples is an indication that they were likely created by the same weaponizer.\n\n### Comparing RTF attribution techniques: pros and cons\n\n**Technique** **Pros** **Cons**\n\nMetadata and author Operator-centric Trivial to change\nname (fleeting & Provides context via social engineering Not required in all weaponized files\noperator‑centric) content and language of targets (‘human Regularly evolving\n\nfingerprint’)\n\nCan be used to track specific campaigns\n\nActor-specific\n\nEasy to track\n\nRTF obfuscation artifacts Unique to shellcode developer Regularly evolving with high turnover so\n(evolving & supply-chain- Supply-chain-centric threat actors can bypass AV detection\ncentric) Can facilitate attribution and correlations\n\nbetween threat actors\n\nEasy to track using YARA rules\n\nShellcode (permanent & A more permanent actor artifact to track Complex to create a signature, specifically\noperator-centric) Usually specific to a single actor utilizing YARA rules to track shellcode\n\nDifficult for actors to change entirely\n\nObject dimensions Very specific to weaponizer developer & Does not provide operator visibility\n(permanent & supply- exploit supplier If multiple actors are using the weaponizer it\nchain-centric) Does not change regularly does not provide deeper attribution to a\n\nAllows attribution of a shared exploit specific group\nsupply chain\n\nMaps relations between different\nconnected groups\n\nTable 2: Comparison of RTF attribution techniques.\n\n|Technique|Pros|Cons|\n|---|---|---|\n|Metadata and author name (fleeting & operator‑centric)|Operator-centric Provides context via social engineering content and language of targets (‘human fingerprint’) Can be use d to track specific campaigns Actor-specific Easy to track|Trivial to change Not required in a ll weaponized files Regularly evolving|\n|RTF obfuscation artifacts (evolving & supply-chain- centric)|Unique to shellcode developer Supply-chain-centric Can facilitate attribut ion and correlations between threat actors Easy to track using YA RA rules|Regularly evolving with high turnover so threat actors can bypass AV detection|\n|Shellcode (permanent & operator-centric)|A more permanent actor artifact to track Usually specific to a single actor Difficult for actors to change enti rely|Complex to create a signature, specifically utilizing YARA rules to track shellcode|\n|Object dimensions (permanent & supply- chain-centric)|Very specific to weaponizer developer & exploit supplier Does not chang e regularly Allows attribution of a shar ed exploit supply chain Maps relation s between different connected groups|Does not provide operator visibility If multiple actors are using the wea ponizer it does not provide deeper attribution to a specific group|\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7: Quadrant view of permanence versus operational visibility in RTF attribution techniques.\n\n## The Royal Road weaponizer\n\nResearchers have identified a unique phishing weaponizer that, to date, has been utilized in Chinese and South Asian APT\ntargeted attacks, as well as in cybercriminal campaigns. The weaponizer, which has been dubbed ‘Royal Road’, is believed\nto be a code base capable of creating weaponized RTF exploits complete with believable lure content for CVE-2017-11882,\nCVE-2018-0802 and CVE-2018-0798. This weaponizer has primarily been used by Chinese APT actors in espionage\ncampaigns supporting intelligence requirements for the Belt and Road Initiative in Central Asia, Russia, Vietnam and\nMongolia, but also with the targeting of US maritime, academic and defence sectors. Specifically, the weaponizer can be\nidentified by the unique object dimensions objh2180/objw300 appearing in the malicious RTF’s strings. Further variations of\nthis weaponizer can be identified by the object data which follows the object dimensions, the metadata associated with the\nRTF files, and an examination of post-exploitation infection techniques utilized by disparate threat actors.\n\nVersions of the Royal Road tool weaponize RTF files to exploit CVE-2017-11882, CVE-2018-0802, and CVE-2018-0798,\nwhich affect the Microsoft Equation Editor. CVE-2017-11882 and CVE-2018-0802 were patched by Microsoft in November\n2017 and January 2018, respectively. The lesser‑known CVE-2018-0798 was also patched in January 2018. Since then,\nRTF files exploiting these vulnerabilities in malspam campaigns pushing malware like LokiBot and Formbook have been\nwell documented. By now, exploits for Equation Editor vulnerabilities are old news, and more than 1,000 samples have\nbeen submitted to VirusTotal since November 2017. Chinese APT threat actors adapted these popular vulnerabilities into\nexploits immediately following their disclosure by Microsoft. The use of a specific weaponizer to exploit well-known\nvulnerabilities allows analysts both to attribute In-the-Wild (ItW) samples and to gain insight into the supply chain\nassociated with numerous APTs across international boundaries.\n\n## Distinguishing between Royal Road versions\n\nAll identified weaponized RTF samples created by the Royal Road tool were found to share the unique RTF object\ndimensions objh2180/objw300. This shared dimension allowed us to draw connections between diverse samples created\nby the tool, as variation exists between different versions of the weaponizer which include unique object data spanning five\ndistinct versions Additionally two distinct methods for executing post-exploitation payloads were found which serve as the\n\n\n-----\n\nprimary method for distinguishing between Chinese APT activity and activity associated with the Sidewinder APT. Finally,\nfurther variation was identified and documented in the methods used amongst disparate Chinese APTs to perform DLL\nside-loading following execution.\n\nFour distinct clusters of Chinese APT activity have been observed utilizing RTF files that contain the Royal Road unique\nobject dimensions. Version 1 utilizes the object data string objw2180\\objh300{\\*\\objclass Equation.3}{\\*\\objdata\n01050000020000000B0000004571756174 and exploits CVE-2017-11882. Versions 2 and 4 utilize the object data string\nobjw2180\\objh300{\\objdata 554567{\\*\\objdata 01050000020000000B0000004571756174696F6E2E and exploit both CVE2017-11882 and CVE-2018-0802. Several of these APT groups have utilized exploits for both CVE-2017-11882 (two\nversions) and CVE-2018-0802 at different times, representing a shared and evolving supply chain between Chinese threat\nactors. Version 4 of the Royal Road weaponizer was observed being utilized by the Sidewinder APT group, using the object\ndata string objw2180\\objh300{\\objdata 554567{{\\*\\objdata 1389E614020000000B0000004571756174696F6E2 to exploit\nCVE-2017-11882. This string is highly similar to the object data string from Royal Road versions 2 and 4.\n\nA fifth variation of the Royal Road builder was also observed in use by Chinese APT actors. The analysed RTF files share\nthe same object dimension (objw2180\\objh300) as used to track the RTF weaponizer. However, in this case the samples\nwere not exploiting CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802. After further analysis, it was discovered that the RTF files were\nexploiting the CVE-2018-0798 vulnerability in Microsoft’s Equation Editor (EQNEDT32). CVE-2018-0798 does not appear\nto be commonly exploited in the wild, even though is more reliable than its better-known Equation Editor RCE counterparts.\nIts reliability is rooted in its efficacy among all Microsoft Word versions that include the Equation Editor. Its counterparts\nCVE-2017-11882 and CVE-2018-0802 are limited to specific versions based on the patches that have been deployed.\nCVE-2017-11882 is only exploitable on an unpatched version prior to its fix, and CVE-2018-0802 is only exploitable on the\nversion released to fix CVE-2017-11882. In contrast, a threat actor utilizing CVE-2018-0798 has a higher likelihood of\nsuccess because it is not limited by version.

Goblin Panda (Conimes) has historically targeted Vietnam,\nutilizing Royal Road RTF phishing attachments to deliver a payload identified as ‘QCRat’. This payload is identifiable via\nthe vulnerable McAfee DLL that was utilized for DLL side-loading (QCLite.dll and QCConsol.exe). This group has\nsubsequently utilized additional malicious PE files side-loaded by legitimate dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) as well as\nPowerShell scripts in phishing campaigns to deliver malware families including Newcore RAT and Gh0st. Royal Road RTF\nsamples are often attributable to Conimes by their distinctive Vietnamese language lures and file names, as well as through\nrecognizable post-infection DLL side-loading techniques.\n\n|Actor|Targeting|Potential motivation|Methodology|Unique tools|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n\n\nGoblin Panda\n(Conimes)\n\n\nVietnam and Southeast\nAsia\n\n\nEspionage aligned\nwith commercial and\nSouth China Sea\nissues\n\n\nRTF phishing followed by\nshellcode executed via an OLE\npackage dropping distinctive\nsource file 8.t\n\n\nQCRat Gh0st\nNewcore\n\n\n-----\n\n|Temp.Periscope (APT40, Leviathan, MudCarp)|US Defence; maritime; academic institutions; international & political organizations|Intellectual property theft and military espionage|RTF phishing followed by shellcode executed via an OLE package dropping distinctive source file 8.t|DadBod EvilTech AirBreak HomeFry MurkyTop|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Nomad Panda & Dagger Panda (Temp.Trident, Icefog)|Mongolia and Central Asia|Economic espionage for Belt & Road Initiative|RTF phishing followed by shellcode executed via an OLE package dropping distinctive source file 8.t|Fucobha Icefog (shared) Gh0st|\n|Temp.Hex (The Maudi Surveillance Operation [5])|Mongolia|Local Chinese interests, human rights activists, Mongolian diplomatic affairs|RTF phishing followed by shellcode executed via an OLE package dropping distinctive source file 8.t|FireShadow Poison Ivy Maudi Tool Suite PlugX|\n|APT responsible for the Reaver malware|SE Asia and India.

This was the first group\nobserved utilizing the Royal Road weaponizer, however, it appears to have ceased using it around December 2017\nfollowing patch adoption for CVE-2017-11882.\n\nTemp.Trident (Dagger Panda & Nomad Panda, Icefog) has historically targeted the Mongolia region (Dagger Panda)\nalongside Russia and Central Asia (Nomad Panda), likely as part of economic espionage efforts in support of the Chinese\nBelt and Road Initiative. Versions of the custom payload ‘Fucobha’ or ‘Icefog’, which was first identified in 2013, have been\nidentified as part of these campaigns. These campaigns have also leveraged more common payloads utilized by Chinese\nAPT groups like Gh0st RAT. Historically, Royal Road RTF samples attributed to this APT have included distinctive RTF\nmetadata author information that recurs across campaigns.\n\nThe APT group responsible for the Reaver and Sun Orcal malware is also believed to utilize the Royal Road exploit builder.\nThis group was the first to be observed utilizing Royal Road v4, which exploited CVE-2018-0802. Historically, this group is\nknown to target groups that oppose the Chinese governmental doctrine of ‘One China’. The targeted groups are often\nreferred to as ‘the Five Poisons’ and include acolytes of Falun Gong, Muslim Uyghurs, supporters of Chinese democracy,\nsupporters of an independent Taiwan, and Tibetans. Since these groups consist primarily of dissidents, the geography\nassociated with Reaver and Sun Orcal targeting is diverse and is believed to be any location where these populations\nreside. Researchers at Cylance publicized Reaver RTF exploits built using the Royal Road tool in May 2019 and reinforced\nthe observation of tool sharing among Chinese APT groups at that time [6].\n\nAnother Chinese APT group known to target Mongolia has been identified through this research. The APT known as\nTemp.Hex and the Maudi Surveillance Operation has been observed utilizing the Royal Road v5 weaponizer. In addition to\nthese distinct Chinese APTs using a common RTF weaponizer, they all share a common post-exploitation execution\ntechnique. Rather than downloading and executing a malicious file, the RTF document drops and executes shellcode via\nan encoded OLE package which then drops a distinctive source file named ‘8.t’ to execute a payload. This method was\nidentified earlier by security analysts in open sources. Anomali Threat Research identified the presence of the unique\nobject dimension objw871\\\\objh811\\\\objscalex8\\\\objscaley8 in RTF files involved with this post-exploitation method.\nSignature alerts for this object’s dimensions indicate the use of the 8.t exploitation technique. The presence of both a\nshared phishing weaponizer and a shared post-exploitation execution technique between these groups is indicative of a\nsignificant TTP overlap. It is noteworthy that, after the use of the 8.t source file that is dropped to the temp directory,\ndifferent files, registries and DLLs are used to execute the malicious payload on the host. The weaponizer and exploitation\ntechniques are shared, but different post‑infection techniques and payloads are utilized. Varying degrees of overlap have\nbeen observed between the post-exploitation techniques of the five Chinese APTs using the Royal Road weaponizer.\n\nAn attribution timeline of publicly available samples is shown in Figure 8.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8:\n\nAttribution timeline of public Royal Road RTF samples.\n\nUnlike the Chinese groups, limited use of the Royal Road weaponizer by the Indian APT actor Sidewinder has been\nobserved. Only version 3 of the weaponizer and three total samples have been observed. Specifically, the RTF exploit for\nCVE-2017-11882 utilized by Sidewinder contains the string objw2180\\objh300{\\objdata 554567{{\\*\\objdata\n1389E614020000000B0000004571756174696F6E2. These dimensions and format are notably similar to the format\nobserved in the Royal Road CVE-2017-11882 v2 tool used by Chinese groups with only the object data obfuscation gadget\nvarying between the samples. The post-exploitation methodology used by the Sidewinder operators deviates completely\nfrom what is utilized by other APT groups. The RTF downloads and executes a payload via an HTA file. The Sidewinder\nAPT has historically targeted organizations linked to the Pakistani Military and is believed by security researchers to be an\nactor associated with Indian espionage interests, possibly operating as a contractor in the space. However, the use of\nweaponized RTF files with unique object dimensions in phishing campaigns relies on the successful exploitation of CVE2017-11882, in which the opened RTF file downloads and executes HTA files on the victim’s machine. Primarily English\nlanguage phishing files that utilize topics involving the military borders of India, China and Pakistan were weaponized and\nrequired execution by the victim to pull down additional files including a malicious HTA file. Once the HTA file was\ndownloaded from a C2 domain and executed, a PowerShell payload contained in the HTA file was executed on the victim’s\nsystem. Another noteworthy aspect of the use of the Royal Road weaponizer by the Sidewinder APT is that it was\nextremely brief. Three samples have been identified from mid-2018. Subsequent Sidewinder campaigns have been\nidentified which suggest that the group is no longer utilizing RTF files as their initial phishing attachments, but are rather\nusing ‘.docx’ files which download RTFs that exploit the Equation Editor exploit CVE-2017-11882. These new RTFs do not\ncontain object dimensions.\n\n\n-----\n\nUtilization of the Royal Road weaponizer v5 exploiting CVE 2018 0798 was attributed to Temp.Trident (Nomad Panda and\nDagger Panda), Conimes (Goblin Panda) and Temp.Hex. Researchers were able to identify multiple samples of malicious\nRTF documents using this weaponizer in the wild. However, determining a precise date of first use is challenging. Some of\nthe analysed samples have a creation date of 19 November 2017 (five days after a patch was released for CVE-201711882) – however, that date appears to be manipulated based on the recent compilation dates of the payloads observed,\nmany of which date to 2019. Researchers place a likely date of first usage in the wild around October 2018 based on a\nsample (e228045ef57fb8cc1226b62ada7eee9b) with a VirusTotal submission date of 29 October 2018 with the RTF\ncreation time of 23 October 2018. This earliest observed sample has been attributed to Conimes. Multiple samples\nanalysed by security researchers that we associate with CVE-2018-0798 have been mentioned in previous instances and\ndetection signatures by others in the security community. We believe that some of these samples were misattributed to\nCVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802 based on their exploitation of the Equation Editor, despite being classified as CVE2018-0798.\n\n## Commodity actors adopt Royal Road\n\nAfter the brief utilization of Royal Road by the Sidewinder APT and its continuous utilization by Chinese APT groups, a new\npattern of usage emerged. On 10 March 2019, analysts discovered a new man-in-the-middle (MitM) phishing campaign\nthat appeared ultimately to deliver the Formbook malware via CVE-2017-11882 RTF exploits. The campaign delivered\nmalicious attachments to users in the address books of compromised victims. These weaponized RTF attachments\nincluded the object dimensions of the Royal Road weaponizer, objw2180\\\\objh300, along with additional object dimensions\nobjw1479\\\\objh975.\n\nFigure 9:\n\nUnique object dimensions present in weaponized commodity RTF attachments.\n\nThe malicious emails, while sharing a broad geographic clustering, did not appear to be targeted in nature because victims\nexisted in different sectors and the phishing lures were found to have commodity purchase order and invoice themes. The\nuse of the Formbook malware in MitM phishing attacks is not unique in itself. However, the tool that threat actors used to\nweaponize RTF phishing attachments for this campaign had only previously been used by the Chinese and Indian APT\nactors noted previously.\n\nA similar campaign was observed on 6 May 2019 utilizing a tariff-themed phishing lure. After the user had executed the\nmalicious RTF attachment it exploited CVE-2017-11882. This gave access to the svchost.exe and wmiprvse.exe processes\nvia Remote Process Calls (RPCs). Wmiprvse.exe then spawns a command line shell as a child process that is used to\nexecute the file ‘~afer125419.tmp’. This file is created on the host by a Visual Basic script that was previously downloaded\nfrom the Pastebin URL pastebin[.]com/raw/9t3R1Ng5 by the malicious RTF.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 10:\n\nVBScript used to create malicious ~afer125419.tmp file.\n\nIn some samples from this campaign, the VBScript was found within a malicious HTA file that was downloaded directly from\na C2 domain by the initial malicious RTF rather than from the above-referenced Pastebin URL. Notably, each of the\nmalicious RTF files includes the RTF metadata author tag ‘n3o’. This metadata information has been associated with\nmalicious purchase order and invoice phishing campaigns since at least 2017. Specifically, the ‘n3o’ metadata author tag\nhas been present in identified RTF phishing files that exploited Equation Editor vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-11882 and CVE2018-0802) from both May 2018 [7] and December 2018.\n\nThe adoption of Royal Road by an additional commodity actor occurred in April 2019. The object dimensions\nobjw2180\\\\objh300 were seen in a malspam campaign which appears to have delivered the commodity ransomware Osiris,\nwhich is an older variant of the Locky ransomware. The campaign leveraged IT themes within its phishing lures and\nspecifically referenced a Samsung printer [8]. The weaponized RTFs all included the metadata author tag ‘wuyan’ and\nincluded phishing lure themes from invoices, to payment documents and purchase orders. ‘Wuyan’ is also a known\nmetadata author tag that has been associated with commodity campaigns that did not utilize the Royal Road weaponizer.\n\n## Weaponizer life cycle\n\nPhishing weaponizers are created, sold and distributed in the cyber threat landscape in a similar fashion to zero-day\nvulnerabilities and proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits. Like zero-day exploits, a weaponizer tool consisting of code that builds\nphishing exploits that target vulnerabilities has the most value (both in monetary and operational terms) prior to a\nvulnerability’s disclosure. During this period often a single sophisticated actor is seen developing a weaponizer for a zeroday that has been identified through targeted vulnerability research. Upon a vulnerability’s disclosure by a PoC or product\nvendor, a period of rapid tool development by multiple actors often occurs during the time when a vulnerability is unpatched\n(‘1 Day’) and during the initial 90 days following the release of a patch. Ninety days is a common duration for patch\nimplementation at large enterprises, however, patching may occur faster or slower based on criticality prioritization within\nan organization. The current US Department of Defense Cybersecurity Discipline Implementation Plan strives to have all\nsystems patched within 21 days of patch release and provides for the network removal of high-risk unpatched devices after\na 120-day period [9]. During the initial patch-adoption period, targeted phishing attacks for a disclosed vulnerability will\nhave a high success rate based on the limited degree of deployed patches in the threat landscape. Therefore, the largest\nnumber of new weaponizers for a specific vulnerability will be observed during this period.\n\nFollowing the initial patch-adoption period, continued adoption, innovation, and diffusion of weaponizer tools is often\nobserved with usage by less sophisticated actors including cybercriminal and commodity adversaries involved with\nmalspam distribution. This adoption of once-sophisticated weaponizers by unsophisticated actors is accompanied by a\ndecrease in the effectiveness of the targeted attacks that make use of the weaponizer because the number of patched\nmachines rises over time. Although less effective in targeted attacks, late-stage weaponizer usage for large-scale,\nuntargeted commodity campaigns like malspam allow additional value to be derived from a weaponizer like Royal Road.\nLate-stage actor adoption of such tools can be further driven by the publication of research that may include both samples\nand code writeups, allowing adversaries to adopt or recreate the published weaponizer.\n\nThe diagram shown in Figure 11 maps the adoption of the Royal Road weaponizer for CVE-2017-11882, CVE-2018-0802\nand CVE-2018-0798 by multiple APT and cybercriminal adversaries. Royal Road has not been found to be a tool that\nexploited these CVEs as zero days CVE 2017 11882 and CVE 2018 0802 were disclosed in the threat landscape and\n\n\n-----\n\npatched by Microsoft in close succession. It is likely that sophisticated APT groups like Temp.Periscope immediately began\ndeveloping or purchased a functional weaponizer for CVE-2017-11882 in the days following disclosure. This conclusion is\nbased on the first functional Royal Road sample being observed just four days after the disclosure of CVE-2017-11882.\nConimes/Goblin Panda was also seen utilizing the same weaponizer and post-infection DLL hijacking methodology within\nthe initial 90-day patching cycle. Meanwhile, the APT group responsible for Reaver malware was found to be utilizing a\nfunctional exploit for CVE-2018-0802 created by the Royal Road builder within 90 days of initial exploit disclosure.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 11:\n\nRoyal Road adoption timeline.\n\nFollowing the initial patching period, new variations of the Royal Road weaponizer began to emerge, with Goblin Panda\nand Nomad Panda deploying an updated version that exploited CVE-2017-11882. These Chinese APT groups were\nsubsequently observed adopting the Royal Road weaponizer version that now exploited CVE-2018-0802, first used by the\nReaver Group. The Sidewinder APT, which is believed to originate from South Asia, was also seen briefly utilizing a\ndifferent version of the Royal Road weaponizer for CVE-2017-11882 following the initial 90 days after patch disclosure\n\n\n-----\n\nThe usage of the Royal Road version 4 weaponizer for CVE 2018 0802 persisted past the initial patching period and also\ncontinued following Anomali’s publication regarding the Royal Road tool that was released in February 2019 [10].\nInterestingly, in the period following publication, an additional cluster of phishing emails using Royal Road version 5 were\nidentified targeting Mongolian speakers that appeared to be related to a Chinese APT group referred to as Temp.Hex by\n_FireEye and the Maudi Surveillance Operation by Norman Shark. Specifically, a Royal Road RTF attachment named_\n‘Цэргийн багийн 8 ээлж ашиглагдах утасны дугаарын жагсаалт.doc’, which translates to ‘List of telephone numbers to be\nused in the 8th Military Team.doc’ (1e78ebbfb5fd1ee66f44030d52f80806d184e6daa00dd7aaa1a30b53c629912d) was\nfound to utilize the C2 mtanews.vzglagtime[.]net, which resolved to the IP 217.69.8[.]255 at the time of analysis [11]. The\nsame IP was observed to be the C2 host used by a FIRESHADOW malware payload in a campaign in January 2019 which\n_FireEye attributed to Temp.Hex and identified as targeting Mongolian transportation and telecommunications sectors._\nAdditionally, another RTF file that FireEye associates with that January campaign (5cc1272272a6de91e1c43832f289c73f)\nutilizes the same post-infection mechanism for DLL side-loading as the above Royal Road sample. The samples drop the\nencoded 8.t file to the temp folder. When this file is decoded it is the malicious executable winhelp.wll. The malicious EXE\nis then copied to the following directory as %APPDATA%\\Intel\\Intel(R) Processor Graphics\\RasTls.dll and side-loaded\nusing the legitimate executable IntelGraphicsController.exe. It is worth noting that the malicious executable file name\n‘winhelp.wll’ has historically been observed in campaigns linked to Dagger Panda and Nomad Panda as well.\n\nWhile the functional CVE-2017-11882 and CVE-2018-0802 were in rapid development by the groups Conimes,\nTemp.Periscope and Reaver following their initial disclosure, a slower adoption was observed for CVE-2018-0798. This\nvulnerability, which also targeted the Equation Editor, was utilized by threat actors following the initial 90-day disclosure\nperiod. Although the exact date of actor adoption is not known for CVE-2018-0798 samples, since the earliest testing\nsamples appear to be timestomped with dates from 2017, we believe ItW samples emerged in October 2018. The version 5\nRoyal Road weaponizer identifiable by the obfuscation gadget string objw2180\\objh300\\objdata\\object\n5154\\781\\'e56\\'2f7\\objdata 01050000020000000b0000004571756174696f6e2e33000000000000000000002e0000d01 was\nseen twice in October 2018. This use continued intermittently until April 2019. Following this adoption, Royal Road version\n5 exploiting CVE-2018-0798 weaponized RTF files became more ubiquitous among the APT groups, with Temp.Hex and\nTemp.Trident incorporating the tool in their tactics.\n\nFinally, following the Anomali publication on the Royal Road weaponizer, and for the first time since its initial emergence in\nNovember 2017, the Royal Road object dimensions began to appear in commodity campaigns delivering malicious RTF\nfiles weaponized for CVE-2017-11882. Appearing first in March 2019 and continuing until June 2019, the timing of this\nrelease in the commodity landscape is striking. Although unsubstantiated at this time, it is possible that, following the\n_Anomali publication about the Royal Road weaponizer, the exploit was released or sold for use by an exploit broker to_\ncommodity actors. Whereas the value of an exploit builder is greatest when no one knows of the vulnerability, its value is\nlowest when in-depth knowledge and detection signatures for a tool have been published. Researchers reiterate that this\npossibility remains unsubstantiated at this time and recognize that adoption of such a tool by both commodity and Indian\nAPT actors could be the result of reverse engineering a sample encountered through fourth/Nth-party collection.\nIntermittent use of the Royal Road weaponizer in commodity phishing campaigns does not inform the origin of the tool as\nbeing created by an exploit broker or an APT developer. However, its commodity emergence does suggest an attempt to\nderive broader value from a tool following an open-source publication which previously documented it as part of multiple\nAPT toolkits.\n\n## Additional threat activity clusters based on RTF object dimensions\n\nResearchers identified an additional 26 clusters of activity identifiable by their unique object dimensions, as show in Figure\n12. It is believed that each of the unique object dimensions and their correlated activity represent a phishing weaponizer\nbeing utilized in the wild. The identified activity includes additional weaponizers utilized by the APT groups responsible for\nthe Reaver malware and the criminal campaigns dubbed ‘Gorgon Group’ by Palo Alto Networks (believed to be associated\nwith the Pakistani APT group Subaat) [12, 13]. Several commodity and unidentified weaponizers were observed that are\nprimarily in use as part of malspam and banking trojan campaigns. Additionally, three public phishing weaponizers were\nidentified in open source as PoCs or GitHub projects which have been utilized in a range of campaigns including both\ncybercriminal and APT activity.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 12:\n\n26 additional RTF weaponizers identified using unique object dimensions.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe application of RTF attribution techniques across over 6,000 samples has ultimately identified 27 RTF weaponizers, 18\nmonths of targeted APT activity spanning six adversaries, and has demonstrated the value derived from the analysis of\nunique object dimensions. While the continued analysis of other aspects of the RTF file format – including metadata,\nshellcode and obfuscation – remains valuable, object dimensions provide a unique visibility into weaponizer tool usage in\nthe threat landscape. The relative ease and significant return of YARA signatures tracking these dimensions provides\nnetwork defenders a high-veracity, repeatable method for identifying malicious RTF phishing attachments. This high-value\nboon to defenders is augmented by the long-term strategic context that tracking object dimension can offer as part of threat\nactor profiling. Should these object dimensions remain relatively obscure in the static detections employed by anti-virus\nsignatures and therefore insignificant in the eyes of threat actors, we believe that attribution will remain in the object.\n\n## References\n\n[[1] 2019 Data Breach Investigations Report.
