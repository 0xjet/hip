Olympic Destroyer was a cyber-sabotage attack based on the\nspread of a destructive network worm. The sabotage stage was preceded by reconnaissance\nand infiltration into target networks to select the best launchpad for the self-replicating and selfmodifying destructive malware.\n\nWe have previously emphasized that the story of Olympic Destroyer is different to that of other\nthreat actors because the whole attack was a masterful operation in deception. Despite that,\nthe attackers made serious mistakes, which helped us to spot and prove the forgery of rare\nattribution artefacts. The attackers behind Olympic Destroyer forged automatically generated\nsignatures, known as Rich Header, to make it look like the malware was produced by Lazarus\nAPT, an actor widely believed to be associated with North Korea. If this is new to the reader,\n[we recommend a separate blog dedicated to the analysis of this forgery.](https://securelist.com/the-devils-in-the-rich-header/84348/)\n\nThe deceptive behavior of Olympic Destroyer, and its excessive use of various false flags,\nwhich tricked many researchers in the infosecurity industry, got our attention. Based on\nmalware similarity, the Olympic Destroyer malware was linked by other researchers to three\nChinese speaking APT actors and the allegedly North Korean Lazarus APT; some code had\nhints of the EternalRomance exploit, while other code was similar to the Netya\n[(Expetr/NotPetya) and BadRabbit targeted ransomware. Kaspersky Lab managed to find](https://securelist.com/schroedingers-petya/78870/)\nlateral movement tools and initial infection backdoors, and has followed the infrastructure used\nto control Olympic Destroyer in one of its South Korean victims.\n\nSome of the TTPs and operational security used by Olympic Destroyer bear a certain\n[resemblance to Sofacy APT group activity. When it comes to false flags, mimicking TTPs is](https://securelist.com/a-slice-of-2017-sofacy-activity/83930/)\nmuch harder than tampering with technical artefacts. It implies a deep knowledge of how the\nactor being mimicked operates as well as operational adaptation to these new TTPs. However,\nit is important to remember that Olympic Destroyer can be considered a master in the use of\nfalse flags: for now we assess that connection with low to moderate confidence.\nWe decided to keep tracking the group and set our virtual ‘nets’ to catch Olympic Destroyer\nagain if it showed up with a similar arsenal. To our surprise it has recently resurfaced with new\nactivity.\n\nIn May-June 2018 we discovered new spear-phishing documents that closely resembled\nweaponized documents used by Olympic Destroyer in the past. This and other TTPs led us to\nbelieve that we were looking at the same actor again. However, this time the attacker has new\ntargets According to our telemetry and the characteristics of the analyzed spear-phishing\n\n\n-----\n\nand Ukraine. They continue to use a non-binary executable infection vector and obfuscated\nscripts to evade detection.\n\n_Simplified infection procedure_\n\n## Infection Analysis\n\nIn reality the infection procedure is a bit more complex and relies on multiple different\ntechnologies, mixing VBA code, Powershell, MS HTA, with JScript inside and more\nPowershell. Let’s take a look at this more closely to let incident responders and security\nresearchers recognize such an attack at any time in the future.\n\nOne of the recent documents that we discovered had the following properties:\n\nMD5: 0e7b32d23fbd6d62a593c234bafa2311\nSHA1: ff59cb2b4a198d1e6438e020bb11602bd7d2510d\nFile Type: Microsoft Office Word\nLast saved date: 2018-05-14 15:32:17 (GMT)\nKnown file name: Spiez CONVERGENCE.doc\n\nThe embedded macro is heavily obfuscated. It has a randomly-generated variable and function\nname.\n\n_Obfuscated VBA macro_\n\n\n-----\n\nsame technique used in the original Olympic Destroyer spear-phishing campaign.\n\nIt starts a new obfuscated Powershell scriptlet via the command line. The obfuscator is using\narray-based rearranging to mutate original code, and protects all commands and strings such\nas the command and control (C2) server address.\n\nThere is one known obfuscation tool used to produce such an effect: Invoke-Obfuscation.\n\n_Obfuscated commandline Powershell scriptlet_\n\nThis script disables Powershell script logging to avoid leaving traces:\n\nIt has an inline implementation of the RC4 routine in Powershell, which is used to decrypt\nadditional payload downloaded from Microsoft OneDrive. The decryption relies on a hardcoded\n32-byte ASCII hexadecimal alphabet key. This is a familiar technique used in other Olympic\nDestroyer spear-phishing documents in the past and in Powershell backdoors found in the\ninfrastructure of Olympic Destroyer’s victims located in Pyeongchang.\n\n\n-----\n\n[/caption]\n\nThe second stage payload downloaded is an HTA file that also executes a Powershell script.\n\n_Downloaded access.log.txt_\n\nThis file has a similar structure to the Powershell script executed by the macro in spearphishing attachments. After deobfuscating it, we can see that this script also disables\nPowershell logging and downloads the next stage payload from the same server address. It\nalso uses RC4 with a pre-defined key:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe final payload is the Powershell Empire agent. Below we partially provide the http stager\nscriptlet for the downloaded Empire agent.\n\nPowershell Empire is a post-exploitation free and open-source framework written in Python\nand Powershell that allows fileless control of the compromised hosts, has modular architecture\nand relies on encrypted communication. This framework is widely used by penetration-testing\ncompanies in legitimate security tests for lateral movement and information gathering.\n\n## Infrastructure\n\nWe believe that the attackers used compromised legitimate web servers for hosting and\ncontrolling malware. Based on our analysis, the URI path of discovered C2 servers included\nthe following paths:\n\n/components/com_tags/views\n/components/com_tags/views/admin\n/components/com_tags/controllers\n/components/com_finder/helpers\n/components/com_finder/views/\n/components/com_j2xml/\n/ t / t t/ t ll /\n\n\n-----\n\n[system, Joomla:](https://github.com/joomla/joomla-cms)\n\n_Joomla components path on Github_\n\nUnfortunately we don’t know what exact vulnerability was exploited in the Joomla CMS. What\nis known is that one of the payload hosting servers used Joomla v1.7.3, which is an extremely\nold version of this software, released in November 2011.\n\n_A compromised server using Joomla_\n\n## Victims and Targets\n\nBased on several target profiles and limited victim reports, we believe that the recent operation\nby Olympic Destroyer targets Russia, Ukraine and several other European countries.\nAccording to our telemetry, several victims are entities from the financial sector in Russia. In\naddition, almost all the samples we found were uploaded to a multi-scanner service from\nEuropean countries such as the Netherlands, Germany and France, as well as from Ukraine\nand Russia.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Location of targets in recent Olympic Destroyer attacks_\n\nSince our visibility is limited, we can only speculate about the potential targets based on the\nprofiles suggested by the content of selected decoy documents, email subjects or even file\nnames picked by the attackers.\n\nOne such decoy document grabbed our attention. It referred to ‘Spiez Convergence’, a bio[chemical threat research conference held in Switzerland, organized by SPIEZ LABORATORY,](https://www.labor-spiez.ch/en/lab/)\n[which not long ago was involved in the Salisbury attack investigation.](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/15/salisbury-attack-russia-claims-chemical-weapons-watchdog-manipulated-findings)\n\n\n-----\n\n_Decoy document using Spiez Convergence topic_\n\nAnother decoy document observed in the attacks (‘Investigation_file.doc’) references the nerve\nagent used to poison Sergey Skripal and his daughter in Salisbury:\n\n\n-----\n\nSome other spear-phishing documents include words in the Russian and German language in\ntheir names:\n\n9bc365a16c63f25dfddcbe11da042974 Korporativ.doc\nda93e6651c5ba3e3e96f4ae2dd763d94 Korporativ_2018.doc\ne2e102291d259f054625cc85318b7ef5 E-Mail-Adressliste_2018.doc\n\n\n-----\n\n_A message in Russian encouraging the user to enable macro (54b06b05b6b92a8f2ff02fdf47baad0e)_\n\nOne of the most recent weaponized documents was uploaded to a malware scanning service\nfrom Ukraine in a file named ‘nakaz.zip’, containing ‘nakaz.doc’ (translated as ‘order.doc’ from\nUkrainian).\n\n_Another lure message to encourage the user to enable macro_\n\nAccording to metadata, the document was edited on June 14th. The Cyrillic messages inside\nthis and previous documents are in perfect Russian, suggesting that it was probably prepared\nwith the help of a native speaker and not automated translation software.\n\nOnce the user enables macro, a decoy document is displayed, taken very recently from a\nUkrainian state organization (the date inside indicates 11 June 2018). The text of the\n[document is identical to the one on the official website of the Ukrainian Ministry of Health.](http://moz.gov.ua/article/ministry-mandates/nakaz-moz-ukraini-vid-11062018--1103-pro-vnesennja-zmin-do-rozpodilu-likarskih-zasobiv-dlja-hvorih-u-do--ta-pisljaoperacijnij-period-z-transplantacii-zakuplenih-za-koshti-derzhavnogo-bjudzhetu-ukraini-na-2016-rik)\n\n\n-----\n\n_Decoy document inside nakaz.doc_\n\nFurther analysis of other related files suggest that the target of this document is working in the\nbiological and epizootic threat prevention field.\n\n## Attribution\n\nAlthough not comprehensive, the following findings can serve as a hint to those looking for a\nbetter connection between this campaign and previous Olympic Destroyer activity. More\ninformation on overlaps and reliable tracking of Olympic Destroyer attacks is available to\nsubscribers of Kaspersky Intelligence Reporting Services (see below).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Similar obfuscated macro structure_\n\nThe documents above show apparent structural similarity as if they were produced by the\nsame tool and obfuscator. The highlighted function name in the new wave of attacks isn’t in\nfact new. While being uncommon, a function named “MultiPage1_Layout” was also found in\nthe Olympic Destroyer spear phishing document (MD5:\n5ba7ec869c7157efc1e52f5157705867).\n\n_Same MultiPage1_Layout function name used in older campaign_\n\n## Conclusions\n\nDespite initial expectations for it to stay low or even disappear, Olympic Destroyer has\nresurfaced with new attacks in Europe, Russia and Ukraine. In late 2017, a similar\nreconnaissance stage preceded a larger cyber-sabotage stage meant to destroy and paralyze\ni f t t f th Wi t Ol i G ll l t d l h i t d\n\n\n-----\n\nreconnaissance stage that will be followed by a wave of destructive attacks with new motives.\nThat is why it is important for all bio-chemical threat prevention and research companies and\norganizations in Europe to strengthen their security and run unscheduled security audits.\n\nThe variety of financial and non-financial targets could indicate that the same malware was\nused by several groups with different interests – i.e. a group primarily interested in financial\ngain through cybertheft and another group or groups looking for espionage targets. This could\nalso be a result of cyberattack outsourcing, which is not uncommon among nation state actors.\nOn the other hand, the financial targets might be another false flag operation by an actor who\nhas already excelled at this during the Pyeongchang Olympics to redirect researchers’\nattention.\n\nCertain conclusions could be made based on motives and the selection of targets in this\ncampaign. However, it is easy to make a mistake when trying to answer the question of who is\nbehind this campaign with only the fragments of the picture that are visible to researchers. The\nappearance, at the start of this year, of Olympic Destroyer with its sophisticated deception\nefforts, changed the attribution game forever. We believe that it is no longer possible to draw\nconclusions based on few attribution vectors discovered during regular investigation. The\nresistance to and deterrence of threats such as Olympic Destroyer should be based on\ncooperation between the private sector and governments across national borders.\nUnfortunately, the current geopolitical situation in the world only boosts the global\nsegmentation of the internet and introduces many obstacles for researchers and investigators.\nThis will encourage APT attackers to continue marching into the protected networks of foreign\ngovernments and commercial companies.\n\nThe best thing we can do as researchers is to keep tracking threats like this. We will keep\nmonitoring Olympic Destroyer and report on new discovered activities of this group.\n\nMore details about Olympic Destroyer and related activity are available to subscribers of\n[Kaspersky Intelligence Reporting services.
