As of October, there have been a combined total of\n384,748 victims from XLoader and FakeSpy attacks globally.\n\nBy: Lorin Wu, Ecular Xu November 26, 2018 Read time: ( words)\n\nXLoader and FakeSpy are two of the most prevalent malware families that emerged from the\nmobile threat landscape recently. We first [reported about XLoader in April 2018 when it used](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/xloader-android-spyware-and-banking-trojan-distributed-via-dns-spoofing/)\nDomain Name System (DNS) cache poisoning/DNS spoofing to victimize users with\nmalicious Android apps that steal PII and financial data and install additional apps.\n[Meanwhile, we released our findings on FakeSpy in June after it infected Android users via](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/fakespy-android-information-stealing-malware-targets-japanese-and-korean-speaking-users/)\n[SMS phishing or SMiShing to launch info-stealing attacks.](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/definition/smishing)\n\nAs of October, there have been a total of 384,748 victims from XLoader and FakeSpy attacks\nglobally, with the majority of victims coming from South Korea and Japan.\n\n[Figure 1. Monthly infection count for XLoader and FakeSpy attacks this year](https://blog.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/migrated/security-intelligence-migration-spreadsheet/trendlabs-security-intelligence/2018/11/figure_1_monthly_infection_count_fakespy_xloader.jpg)\n\nFigure 1. Monthly infection count for XLoader and FakeSpy attacks this year\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen we released our initial findings on XLoader and FakeSpy, they appeared to have\nnothing to do with each other. However, our new research uncovered clues that could\nindicate that they are either being operated by the same threat actor group or that their\noperators are affiliated with each other.\n\n**XLoader and FakeSpy posed as legitimate apps of a Japanese home delivery service**\n**company**\n\nThe first clue that led to the discovery of the connection between XLoader and FakeSpy is\nwhen the former was observed disguising as a legitimate app of a major Japanese home\ndelivery service company in June. Interestingly, almost all FakeSpy variants posed as the\nabovementioned Japanese apps to steal sensitive information from users.\n\nDigging deeper into the activities of XLoader and FakeSpy, we learned that they use the\nsame ecosystem to deploy malware. We used VirusTotal to search for an XLoader sample\n(bf0ad39d8a19b9bc385fb629e3227dec4012e1f5a316e8a30c932202624e8e0e) in July and\nlearned that the sample was downloaded from a malicious domain posing under the name of\nthe said home delivery service company. When we analyzed a FakeSpy sample\n(ba5b85a4dd70b96f4a43bda5eb66e546facc4e3523f78a91fc01c768c6de5c24) over a month\nlater, we discovered that it was downloaded from the same malicious domain.\n\nFigure 2. VirusTotal showing details of an XLoader sample coming from domain of a\nJapanese home delivery service company\n\nFigure 2. VirusTotal showing details of an XLoader sample coming from the abovementioned\ndomain\n\n[Figure 3. A FakeSpy sample was found to have been downloaded from the same domain](https://blog.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/migrated/security-intelligence-migration-spreadsheet/trendlabs-security-intelligence/2018/11/Figure_3_FakeSpy_Domain.jpg)\n\nFigure 3. A FakeSpy sample was found to have been downloaded from the same domain\n\nMultiple XLoader and FakeSpy samples also showed the same results. As of this writing, we\nidentified 126 domains that XLoader and FakeSpy shared for deploying malware (see\ncomplete IoC list in the research paper).\n\nIn addition, we saw similarities in XLoader and FakeSpy’s methods involving their C&C\naddresses. Some of their variants abuse social media user profiles to hide their real C&C\naddresses.\n\nFigure 4. XLoader hiding its real C&C address in a social media user profile. Note: Through\nactive cooperation with vendors that own the involved domains mentioned in this research,\nthe user profile pages and accounts have been blocked.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5. The IP address is written on social media profiles, always starting with ^^ and ends\nwith $$. When the app is launched, it will access the page and parse contents to get the real\nC&C address.\n\n**The Yanbian Gang connection**\n\nAnalyzing the code structure and behavior of XLoader and FakeSpy, we were able to\ncorrelate the latter’s samples to those of the [Yanbian Gang, a Chinese cybercriminal](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/mobile-malware-gang-steals-millions-from-south-korean-users/)\ngroup infamous for stealing money from account holders of South Korean banks.\n\nAside from the fact that FakeSpy and Yanbian apps targeted online banking users in Japan\nand South Korea, we also learned that both operators used malware with similar code:\n\n[Figure 6. Code from a Yanbian Gang app](https://blog.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/migrated/security-intelligence-migration-spreadsheet/trendlabs-security-intelligence/2018/11/Figure_6_Yanbian_code.jpg)\n\nFigure 6. Code from a Yanbian Gang app\n\n[Figure 7. Code from a FakeSpy app](https://blog.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/migrated/security-intelligence-migration-spreadsheet/trendlabs-security-intelligence/2018/11/Figure_7_FakeSpy_code.jpg)\n\nFigure 7. Code from a FakeSpy app\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8. The malicious app from the Yanbian Gang (top) and a FakeSpy sample (bottom)\nshare similar metadata containing the infected devices’ information and C&C server path.\n\nWHOIS results revealed that the registrants of FakeSpy and XLoader's shared malicious\ndomains (for the fake apps of the Japanese home delivery service company) are from China.\nThe registrants’ phone numbers also appear to originate from the Jilin Province, which was\nknown as the Yanbian Gang members’ location.\n\nConsidering all information gathered from our research, we can speculate that the Yanbian\nGang has possible connections to FakeSpy and XLoader. However, it could just also mean\nthat two different sets of threat actors or groups are using the same service or deployment\ninfrastructure. Nevertheless, the prevalence of XLoader and FakeSpy should remind users to\n[always follow best practices on mobile security.](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/mobile-safety/best-practices-securing-your-mobile-device)\n\nFor more details on XLoader and FakeSpy’s behavior, targets, infrastructure, attack vectors,\nand how they evolved over the years, check out our research paper titled “The Evolution of\n_XLoader and FakeSpy: Two Interconnected Android Malware Families.”_\n\nContent added to Folio\n\n\n-----",
