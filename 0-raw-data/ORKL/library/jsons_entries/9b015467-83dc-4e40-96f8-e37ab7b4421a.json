According to BR, a high-ranking German official said the actors behind Winnti continue to be highly\nactive. For their investigation, BR and NDR interviewed more than 30 people: company staff, IT security experts,\ngovernment officials, and representatives of security authorities. The goal of the attackers was to collect information on\nthe organisational charts of their targets, cooperating departments, IT systems of business units, and trade secrets.\nInvestigations showed that the hackers were, however, implementing poor operational security (OPSEC) practices. For\nexample, they wrote the names of the companies they wanted to spy on directly into their malware.\n\nInitially, the collective behind Winnti was motivated by financial gain and the gaming sector was especially targeted. For\nexample, by 2011, one of their victims was Gameforge, a company that offers so-called freemium games: while playing the\ngames is free, it is possible to buy virtual items/money with real money. The Winnti hackers were able to directly access\nGameforge’s databases and modify accounts to become ‘virtually’ richer.\n\nThen, by 2014, the Winnti malware code was no longer limited to game developers. According to Costin Raiu from\nKaspersky, ‘Nine years ago, things were much more clear-cut. There was a single team, which developed and used Winnti.\nIt now looks like there is at least a second group that also uses Winnti.’ According to BR, the second group’s job is mainly\nindustrial espionage. For example, BR says they found evidence that, in 2014, the Winnti hackers broke into the networks\nof Henkel, a manufacturer of many industrial products, including adhesives for industrial applications. Interestingly, in\n2019, two French adhesives manufacturers, Covesto and Bostik, were reportedly infected by Winnti.\n\nThe Winnti malware has also reportedly infected political targets (Hong Kong, Tibet). Hackers have also used Winnti for\nthe collection of large sets of personal data from Marriott and Lion Air customers. According to BR findings, victims of\nWinnti malware include the following:\n\n**Sector** **Targets** **Likely motive**\nGaming Gameforge, Valve Financial gain\nSoftware Teamviewer\n\nTechnology Siemens, Sumitomo, Thyssenkrupp\nIndustrial espionage\nPharma Bayer, Roche\nChemical BASF, Covestro, Shin-Etsu\nGovernment Hong Kong\nPolitical espionage\nGovernment (via Telecom) Possibly the ‘Central Tibetan Administration’ via a telecom provider\nHotels Marriott\nPersonal data collection\nAirline Lion Air\n\n### Comments\n\nThe case of Winnti is an excellent illustration of a malware initially developed for cybercriminal purposes and which has\nsince been repurposed for cyber-espionage. Although it is not exactly known how it has been shared, it is highly likely that\nseveral hacking groups have used this malware. This tactic indeed offers an excellent means of anonymising operations\nand making attribution difficult. This also gives one plausible explanation for the poor OPSEC practises observed from\nWinnti users. Although it is likely that some Winnti attacks are state-sponsored and support Chinese government\nobjectives, we cannot rule out that other, non-Chinese, hackers have also used the malware.\n\nIn an attempt to distinguish cybercriminal and cyber-espionage activities, industry reporting has given several different\nnames to group(s) using Winnti such as Winnti group, Wicked Spider, Wicked Panda, APT17, APT22, Barium, Axiom,\nDeputy Dog, Dogfish, ShadowHammer, and Blackfly.\n\n1 [https://web.br.de/interaktiv/winnti/english/](https://web.br.de/interaktiv/winnti/english/)\n2 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAX)\n\nCERT-EU, CERT for the EU Institutions, Bodies and Agencies\n[https://cert.europa.eu](https://cert.europa.eu/)\n\n|Sector|Targets|Likely motive|\n|---|---|---|\n|Gaming|Gameforge, Valve|Financial gain|\n|Software|Teamviewer|Industrial espionage|\n|Technology|Siemens, Sumitomo, Thyssenkrupp||\n|Pharma|Bayer, Roche||\n|Chemical|BASF, Covestro, Shin-Etsu||\n|Government|Hong Kong|Political espionage|\n|Government (via Telecom)|Possibly the ‘Central Tibetan Administration’ via a telecom provider||\n|Hotels|Marriott|Personal data collection|\n|Airline|Lion Air||\n\n\n-----",
