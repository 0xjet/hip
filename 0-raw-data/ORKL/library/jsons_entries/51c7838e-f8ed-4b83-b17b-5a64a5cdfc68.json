This family of ransomware is written in Go and generates encrypted files with\nthe .google extension.\n\nSpotted in April 2020, GoGoogle ransomware has several peculiarities.\n\nFirst of all, it is written in Golang, a programming language that has grown popular among\nransomware creators as of late. Secondly, the two versions of GoGoogle use two distinct\nencryption methods, depending on the size of the files to be encrypted. While one version\nexclusively uses XOR-based encryption, the other uses XOR for files larger than 1MB and\nRSA 1024 for smaller files.\n\nThis decryptor currently solves infections for .google files encrypted with the XOR method.\nAn updated decryptor to become available in the future will handle the RSA 1024 scenario as\nwell.\n\n**How to use this tool**\n\n**Step 1: Download the decryption tool below and save it on your computer.**\n\n[Download the GoGoogle decryptor](http://download.bitdefender.com/am/malware_removal/BDGoGoogleDecryptor.exe)\n\n**Step 2: Double-click the file (previously saved as BDGoGoogleDecryptor.exe) and allow it to**\nrun.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Step 3: Select “I Agree” in the License Agreement screen**\n\n**Step 4: Select “Scan Entire System” if you want to search for all encrypted files, or just add**\nthe path to your encrypted files.  We strongly recommend you also select “Backup files”\nbefore starting the decryption process. Then press “Scan”.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe “test folder” must contain two pairs of original/encrypted files which will be used to\ndetermine the decryption type. It is essential that this folder only contains two pairs:\n\n-1 pair of encrypted/original files, both smaller than 1 MB.\n-1 pair of encrypted/original files, both larger than 2 MB.\nNOTE: Some versions of GoGoogle are known for irrecoverably altering files under 2MB.\n\nUsers may also check the “Overwrite existing clean files” option under “Advanced options” so\nthe tool will overwrite possible present clean files with their decrypted equivalent.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe tool can also run silently, via a command line. If you need to automate deployment of\nthe tool inside a large network, you might want to use this feature.\n\n-  -help - provides information on how to run the tool silently (this information will be written\nin the log file, not on console)\n\n-  start - this argument allows the tool to run silently (no GUI)\n\n-  -path - this argument specifies the path to scan\n\n-  -test - this argument specifies the test path where should be a pair of original/encrypted\nfiles\n\n-  o0:1 - enables Scan entire system option (ignoring -path argument)\n\n-  o1:1 - enables Backup files option\n\n-  o2:1 - enables Overwrite existing files option\n\n**Examples:**\n\nBDGoGoogleDecryptor.exe start -path:”C:\\” -> the tool starts with no GUI and scan C:\\\nBDGoGoogleDecryptor.exe start o0:1 -> the tool starts with no GUI and scan entire system\nBDGoGoogleDecryptor.exe start o0:1 o1:1 o2:1 -> the tool scans the entire system, backup\nthe encrypted files and overwrite present clean files .\n**Acknowledgement:**\n\n\n-----\n\nThis product includes software developed by the OpenSSL Project, for use in the OpenSSL\nToolkit (http://www.openssl.org/)\n\n**TAGS**\n\n[anti-malware research](http://10.10.0.46/blog/labs/tag/antimalware-research/) [free tools](http://10.10.0.46/blog/labs/tag/free-tools/)\n\n**AUTHOR**\n\n## Bitdefender\n\nThe meaning of Bitdefender’s mascot, the Dacian Draco, a symbol that depicts a mythical\nanimal with a wolf’s head and a dragon’s body, is “to watch” and to “guard with a sharp eye.”\n\n[View all posts](http://10.10.0.46/blog/labs/author/bitdefenderteam/)\n\n\n## Bitdefender\n\nThe meaning of Bitdefender’s mascot, the Dacian Draco, a symbol that depicts a mythical\nanimal with a wolf’s head and a dragon’s body, is “to watch” and to “guard with a sharp eye.”\n\n[View all posts](http://10.10.0.46/blog/labs/author/bitdefenderteam/)\n\n\n-----",
