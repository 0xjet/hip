However, that is not enough. True cybersecurity experts need answers to a wider](https://www.kaspersky.com/true-cybersecurity?redef=1&reseller=gl_truecs_acq_ona_smm__onl_b2b_blog_ban_______)\n\n\n-----\n\nrange of questions. What was the purpose of the attack? Did attackers succeed? What tools\nwere involved in the attack? Where else were similar methods and programs used?\n\nAnswers to these questions help with forecasting the further development of trends, and\nmost important, help with prompt response to future attacks of the same authorship or\ncampaigns that employ the same code. That is why it is important not only to study the mode\nof action of modern cybercriminals, but also to understand the methods of all earlier attacks.\nAs a company that’s been engaged in information security for 20 years, we understand this\nas few others can.\n\nThat is why our experts, aided by researchers from King’s College London, have carefully\nstudied Moonlight Maze — one of the first widely known cyberespionage campaigns, active\nsince at least 1996. It is of particular interest because several independent experts from\ncountries have voiced the proposition that it is associated with a much more modern — and\n[still active — group, the authors of the Turla APT attack.](https://securelist.com/analysis/publications/65545/the-epic-turla-operation/)\n\nEven the story of how our experts got the information about Moonlight Maze deserves\nspecial mention. Initially, in the late nineties, all of the investigation materials were classified\nby US law enforcement agencies, and so inaccessible to researchers. However, in an\nattempt to cover their tracks, the attackers used an extensive network of proxy servers\nworking in various universities and libraries in the United States, as well as at least one\nserver in England. On the English server, the local system administrator, who worked on the\ncase with London police and the FBI, activated the logging of all activities. And those logs\nsurvived to our times. As a result, our experts got a unique time capsule containing a\ndetailed record of all the attacker’s actions.\n\nWatch Video At:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/9RorL9y70GU\n\n\n-----\n\nPerhaps the most interesting finding of their research is the backdoor that was used in\nMoonlight Maze. It was based on the Unix program LOKI2, which was released in 1996 and\nallowed transmission of data via covert channels. Linux backdoors were also employed in\nTurla, which Kaspersky Lab first detected in 2014. And those backdoors were built on the\nbasis of LOKI2 as well. Code created more than 20 years ago is still used by modern actors,\nalbeit in a slightly updated form.\n\n[You can find a full study on Securelist, along with a brief excursion into the history of this](https://securelist.com/blog/sas/77883/penquins-moonlit-maze)\nAPT (which reads like a good detective story).\n\nThe takeaway here is nothing new: You have to know the past to understand the present.\n[Therefore, while conducting investigations of new cyberincidents, our experts call on](https://www.kaspersky.com/advert/enterprise-security/intelligence-services?redef=1&THRU&reseller=gl_kbusinesspost_pro_ona_smm__onl_b2b_kbusiness_lnk_______)\nknowledge accumulated for more than 20 years.\n\nIn addition, this story is a good reminder to those who still believe that Linux platforms are\ninherently safe. They are wrong. And their mistake is already at least 21 years old.\n\n[APT](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/tag/apt/)\n[Moonlight Maze](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/tag/moonlight-maze/)\n[SAS](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/tag/sas/)\n[SAS 2017](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/tag/sas-2017/)\n[True Cybersecurity](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/tag/true-cybersecurity/)\n[Turla](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/tag/turla/)\n\nShare article\n\nRelated\n\n\n-----",
