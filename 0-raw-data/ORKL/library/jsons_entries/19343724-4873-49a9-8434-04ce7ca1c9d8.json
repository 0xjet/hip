    "plain_text": "# Marine Safety Information Bulletin\n\nCommandant MSIB Number: 10-19\nU.S. Coast Guard Date: December 16, 2019\nInspections and Compliance Directorate Contact: Mr. Charles Blackmore\n2703 Martin Luther King Jr Ave, SE, STOP 7501 Phone: (202) 372-1109\nWashington, DC 20593-7501 E-Mail: charles.t.blackmore@uscg.mil\n\n## Cyberattack Impacts MTSA Facility Operations\n\nThe purpose of this bulletin is to inform the maritime community of a recent incident involving a\nransomware intrusion at a Maritime Transportation Security Act (MTSA) regulated facility. Forensic\nanalysis is currently ongoing but the virus, identified as “Ryuk” ransomware, may have entered the\nnetwork of the MTSA facility via an email phishing campaign. Once the embedded malicious link in the\nemail was clicked by an employee, the ransomware allowed for a threat actor to access significant\nenterprise Information Technology (IT) network files, and encrypt them, preventing the facility’s access\nto critical files. The virus further burrowed into the industrial control systems that monitor and control\ncargo transfer and encrypted files critical to process operations. The impacts to the facility included a\ndisruption of the entire corporate IT network (beyond the footprint of the facility), disruption of camera\nand physical access control systems, and loss of critical process control monitoring systems. These\ncombined effects required the company to shut down the primary operations of the facility for over 30\nhours while a cyber-incident response was conducted.\n\n[For more information on Ryuk ransomware, please visit: https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/current-](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/current-activity/2019/06/28/ncsc-releases-advisory-ryuk-ransomware)\n[activity/2019/06/28/ncsc-releases-advisory-ryuk-ransomware.](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/current-activity/2019/06/28/ncsc-releases-advisory-ryuk-ransomware)\n\nAt a minimum, the following measures may have prevented or limited the breach and decreased the time\nfor recovery:\n\n  - Intrusion Detection and Intrusion Prevention Systems to monitor real-time network traffic\n\n  - Industry standard and up to date virus detection software\n\n  - Centralized and monitored host and server logging\n\n  - Network segmentation to prevent IT systems from accessing the Operational Technology (OT)\n\nenvironment\n\n  - Up-to-date IT/OT network diagrams\n\n  - Consistent backups of all critical files and software\n\nThe Coast Guard recommends facilities utilize the National Institute of Standards and Technology\n(NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) and NIST Special Publication 800-82 when implementing a\nCyber Risk Management Program.\n\nThe Coast Guard urges maritime stakeholders to verify the validity of the email sender prior to\nresponding to or opening any unsolicited email messages. Additionally, facility owners and operators\nshould continue to evaluate their cybersecurity defense measures to reduce the effect of a cyber-attack.\n\n\n-----\n\nFor more information on ransomware-related best practices and other resources please visit the\n[Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) ransomware resource page at: https://www.us-](https://www.us-cert.gov/Ransomware)\n[cert.gov/Ransomware.](https://www.us-cert.gov/Ransomware)\n\nAs a reminder, suspicious activity and breaches of security, including breaches of telecommunications\nequipment, including computer, system and network security measures which support functions\ndescribed in the facility security plan or could contribute to a Transportation Security Incident (TSI),\nmust be reported to the National Response Center (NRC) at (800) 424-8802. For additional guidance on\n[the defining and reporting of cyber incidents refer to CG-5P Policy Letter 08-16, “Reporting Suspicious](https://homeport.uscg.mil/Lists/Content/Attachments/2676/CG-5P%20Policy%20Letter%2008-16_3.pdf)\n_Activity and Breaches of Security.”_\n\nThe Coast Guard encourages companies and their facilities to remain vigilant in the identification and\nprompt reporting of suspicious cyber-related activities. Questions pertaining to this bulletin may be\ndirected to the Coast Guard Office of Port & Facility Compliance’s Domestic Ports Division (CG-FAC1) at (202) 372-1109.\n\n-uscg\n_This release has been issued for public information and notification purposes only._\n\n\n-----",
