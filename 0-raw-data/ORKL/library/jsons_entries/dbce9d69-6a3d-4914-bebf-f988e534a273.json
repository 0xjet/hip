In this blog post we'll analyze two specific incidents apparently targeting\n\n**victims in Vietnam and in India and we'll describe the capabilities of the custom backdoor being used**\n\nthat for convenience (and to our knowledge, for a lack of an existing name) we call KeyBoy, due to a\n\nstring present in one of the samples.\n\nWe'll describe how the attackers operate these backdoors, provide some scripts useful to further\n\ninvestigate the campaign as well as meanings to detect infections or scout for additional samples.\n\n## Exploits and Payloads\n\nWe encountered the first document exploit called \"THAM luan- GD- NCKH2.doc\" a few days ago, which\n\nappears to be leveraging some vulnerabilities patched with MS12-060. When opened with a vulnerable\n\nversion of Microsoft Word, the exploit will initiate the infection routine and display the legitimate\n\ndocument that follows:\n\n\n-----\n\nand researching scientific topics. We have no knowledge on the identity of the target, but we can assume\n\nhe might part of the Vietnamese academic community. The document is named to Nguyen Anh Tuan,\n\nwhich is presented as author of this crafted text.\n\nFollowing are the hashes of the exploit file:\n\n**THAM luan- GD- NCKH2.doc**\n\n**Hash** **Value**\n\nMD5 161c840748df9b49fda878394398425a\n\nSHA1 e3cc84a4dc66e43453a039c3c983fcef92eafa7d\n\nSHA256 5ba8c42807bee050aa474fe3c876936d196c65dca9895ccd2e317133188c905e\n\n30bb6c3bcb797b8ebe5ab4bef59173ba358ea6713ea26cbc0147c37b99a54eca62f09475299a44c3\nSHA512\n98679f84fa87dc6dff084a185543945f123fb34236fa825b\n\nWhen executed the exploit initially creates and launches a dropper at location %Temp%\\svchost.exe\n\nwith the following hashes:\n\n**svchost.exe**\n\n**Hash** **Value**\n\nMD5 1f4d22e5131a66aa24f44eb0d4f1b54d\n\nSHA1 2c8a144331ec124755413f31a83e21015c74f2ec\n\nSHA256 1c076413cca929b7004863f1a3992afda665786d6e179b9886ddeb8062194049\n\n6a73333ca96ce0db7fa62eec34987070b823d95618e9c5e36ac0486927270794790d957ebc40c513\nSHA512\n23941ed22acded5ecfa3e9acd88f2c66a6619fa6793231ea\n\nThis payload then creates a DLL file in system32 called CREDRIVER.dll, which is in fact the actual\n\n**backdoor:**\n\n**CREDRIVER.dll**\n\n**Hash** **Value**\n\nMD5 2df60de8cb6b9fe7db1ea10581cfcda4\n\nSHA1 fb8057595f2bb53331620c717775751df781c151\n\nSHA256 ba4863d8a22864fa50a32aa85bc808371f05e8953167d34251cbd779d33e2d6d\n\n5907c682e1cce4ce2aae3a165abefd40e7de4c4befefe895204ee59f9efd11ef75f894cd535597fe\nSHA512\n698de80f6ee4e361234c96a0454c490b4faa69869191ed81\n\nWe also identified another document exploiting CVE-2012-0158, but this time apparently targeting some\n\nIndian individuals.

Resilience on the system is guaranteed**\n\nby the use of such service which will be executed at every start up.\n\nNote that the Indian attack does not make use of this middle-stage dropper, but directly installs and\n\nlaunches the Windows service instead.\n\nThis backdoor has several features including:\n\n1. **Steal credentials from Internet Explorer**\n\n2. **Steal credentials from Mozilla Firefox**\n\n3. Install a keylogger for intercepting credentials on Google Chrome\n\n4. Operate in an interactive mode to allow the attacker to perform additional investigation on the\n\ncompromised system and exfiltrate data.\n\nFollowing you can see the portion of the code where the backdoor, after having verified which version of\n\nMozilla Firefox is installed on the system, decides which technique to use to recover the credentials from\n\nthe browser's local storage.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn older versions of Firefox, credentials were stored in several .txt files in %AppData%\\Mozilla\\Firefox,\n\nwhile in most recent ones they are stored in a SQLite database. In the following snipped you see the SQL\n\nstatement to extract the data:\n\nJust in the same way, the backdoor attempts to collect password autocomplete from Internet Explorer:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe backdoor also creates a separate thread that installs a Windows hook procedure on message\n\nWH_KEYBOARD_LL, through which it can intercept keystrokes. We believe this is mainly used to\n\nintercept credentials from other browsers, specifically Google Chrome:\n\n## Analysis of the Protocol\n\nThe backdoor tries to contact the following domains until it gets a response from an active one:\n\n\n-----\n\ncpnet.phmail.us\n\nimlang.phmail.org\n\nThe Indian backdoor tries to contact the following domains instead:\n\ncresy.zyns.com\n\npreter.epac.to\n\nbackto.ddns.name\n\nIn the first set of domains they are either registered with Whois proxy services or with fake identities. In\n\nthe second set they are making use of a dynamic DNS service by ChangeIP.com.\n\nFollowing are traces collected from passive DNS data relevant to the hosts involved in these attacks:\n\n**Domain** **First Seen** **Last Seen** **IPs** **ASN**\n\nMay 21st May 25th 199.193.66.51 (TTL: 6939 - HURRICANE - Hurricane\nsilence.phdns01.com\n2013 2013 1800) Electric, Inc.\n\nMay 10th May 24th 199.193.66.51 (TTL: 6939 - HURRICANE - Hurricane\ncpnet.phmail.us\n2013 2013 1800) Electric, Inc.\n\nMay 22nd May 23rd 199.193.66.51 (TTL: 6939 - HURRICANE - Hurricane\nimlang.phmail.org\n2013 2013 1800) Electric, Inc.\n\nMarch 9th April 19th 199.193.66.51 (TTL: 6939 - HURRICANE - Hurricane\nvtt.phdns01.com\n2013 2013 1800) Electric, Inc.\n\nMay 31st May 31st 1.235.10.28 (TTL: 9318 - HANARO-AS Hanaro\npreter.epac.to\n2013 2013 30) Telecom Inc.\n\nMay 18th May 28th 113.160.44.154\npreter.epac.to 45899 - VNPT-AS-VN VNPT Corp\n2013 2013 (TTL: 30)\n\nThis is an initial request that the backdoor would send out on port 443 to an active C&C:\n\n00000000 c4 4c 87 3f 11 1e c4 1a 2c a9 12 1a 19 61 82 de |.L.?....,....a..|\n\n00000010 19 26 f8 de bd 26 de 19 b0 19 1a 95 a1 dd 2b 6d |.&...&........+m|\n\n00000020 c2 1a 82 b0 19 eb 47 b0 26 47 b0 26 20 82 eb ca |......G.&G.& ...|\n\n00000030 bd 26 ca 82 54 1a d0 c2 87 38 a1 20 82 b0 19 eb |.&..T....8. ....|\n\n00000040 b0 54 b0 19 1a 00                 |.T....|\n\nAt the time of the analysis all the C&C servers were not responding, we started reverse engineering the\n\ncommunication protocol and noticed that it simply used a multiply with 0x69 to encode the traffic sent to\n\nthe controllers.

Recently the growth of amount\n\n\n-----\n\n**opportunistic carpet bombings rather than ninja strikes. It s common to observe attacks pulled**\n\noff successfully without any particular sophistication in place, including the incidents described in this\n\npost.\n\nIt's also getting quite difficult to attribute the attacks to any state-sponsored unit, both because there's a\n\ngeneric lack of strong evidence in such incidents (which is why we refrained from making any statement\n\non the origin of these intrusions) but frankly also because almost anybody could operate such\n\n**campaigns and be reasonably successful. The only differentiation between actors at this point exclusively**\n\nrelies on identifying the motivations and the context.\n\nBeware though, just because these attacks are conceptually targeted, it doesn't necessarily mean that they\n\nshould have a higher priority than any other threat on your security program. Our suggestion remains the\n\nsame: identify your core assets, recognize the most impactful threats to such assets and inform and protect\n\nyourself accordingly.\n\n[This research was brought to you by Claudio Guarnieri and Mark Schloesser from Rapid7 Labs.](http://twitter.com/botherder)\n\n\n-----",
