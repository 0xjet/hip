Mahan in the District of Nevada. Chiochiu is a\nnational of the Republic of Moldova, but resided in the United States during the period of the\nconspiracy. His plea came just over a month after the co-founder and administrator of\nInfraud, Sergey Medvedev of Russia, separately pleaded guilty on June 26. Sentencing for\nChiochiu has been scheduled for Dec. 11.\n\n\n-----\n\nInfraud was an Internet-based cybercriminal enterprise engaged in the large-scale\nacquisition, sale, and dissemination of stolen identities, compromised debit and credit cards,\npersonally identifiable information, financial and banking information, computer malware, and\nother contraband.\n\n“Over the course of seven years, Infraud and its alleged conspirators created a sophisticated\ncybercriminal racketeering scheme that victimized individuals, merchants, and financial\ninstitutions to the tune of over half a billion dollars in losses,” said Acting Assistant Attorney\nGeneral Brian C. Rabbitt of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. “The Justice\nDepartment is committed to unmasking cyber criminals and their criminal organizations that\nuse the internet for fraudulent schemes.”\n\n“HSI and our partners are at the forefront of combating financial crimes and illicit activities\nspread on the Internet,” said Special Agent in Charge Francisco Burrola for the U.S.\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Las Vegas\nOffice. “While criminal operators may continue to grow the reach of their criminal activity,\nultimately they do not escape the reach of law enforcement. We continue to investigate,\ndisrupt, and dismantle hidden illegal networks that pose a threat in cyberspace.”\n\nAccording to the indictment, the Infraud Organization was created in October 2010 by\nMedvedev and Svyatoslav Bondarenko, aka “Obnon,” “Rector,” and “Helkern,” 34, of\nUkraine, to promote and grow interest in the Infraud Organization as the premier destination\nfor “carding” —purchasing retail items with counterfeit or stolen credit card information — on\nthe Internet. Under the slogan, “In Fraud We Trust,” the organization directed traffic and\npotential purchasers to the automated vending sites of its members, which served as online\nconduits to traffic in stolen means of identification, stolen financial and banking information,\nmalware, and other illicit goods. It also provided an escrow service to facilitate illicit digital\ncurrency transactions among its members and employed screening protocols that purported\nto ensure only high quality vendors of stolen cards, personally identifiable information, and\nother contraband were permitted to advertise to members. In March 2017, there were\n10,901 registered members of the Infraud Organization.\n\nBondarenko currently remains a fugitive.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Chiochiu provided guidance to other Infraud members on the\ndevelopment, deployment, and use of malware as a means of harvesting stolen data. As\npart of his plea agreement, Chiochiu admitted to authoring a strain of malware known to the\ncomputer security community as “FastPOS”.\n\nDuring the course of its seven-year history, the Infraud Organization inflicted approximately\n$2.2 billion in intended losses, and more than $568 million in actual losses, on a wide swath\nof financial institutions, merchants, and private individuals, and would have continued to do\nso for the foreseeable future if left unchecked.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe investigation was conducted by the Las Vegas Office of U.S. Immigration and Customs\nEnforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations and the Henderson, Nevada Police\nDepartment. The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Central District of California also provided\nassistance with Chiochiu’s case. Deputy Chief Kelly Pearson and Trial Attorneys Chad W.\nMcHenry and Alexander Gottfried of the Criminal Division’s Organized Crime and Gang\nSection are prosecuting the case.\n\nThe year 2020 marks the 150th anniversary of the Department of Justice.
