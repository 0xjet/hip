For the casual,\ntech-savvy person it’s probably the ultra-high definition of recent years’ TV models.\nFor anyone who has been using a computer since the dawn of the PC era, it might\nmean a ‘demo’ program: a small piece of low-level code that creates outstanding\n(for the system it runs on, at least) 3D visuals on screen. For the less tech savvy one,\nit might just mean good old cash. Curiously, both of these last two definitions can be\napplied to our latest investigation.\n\n[When we discovered UDPoS last year, we had mixed views on both it and recent](https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/x-labs/udpos-exfiltrating-credit-card-data-dns)\nPoint-of-Sale (POS) malware in general. On one hand we didn’t really expect\nanything new in terms of POS malware, on the other, we could easily identify the\nunderlying reasons why these threats are still popular.\n\n\nUDPoS was a warning sign that the POS portion of the threat landscape is still\nsomething to keep an eye on. Meanwhile, events such as Kroll Cyber Security\n[revealing PinkKite – a new POS based threat, although with little to no tangible](https://threatpost.com/new-pos-malware-pinkkite-takes-flight/130428/)\n[information available - and activities on the infamous Joker’s Stash site made us](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/05/will-the-real-jokers-stash-come-forward/)\ndig deeper.\n\n###### Tiny + Loader\nFor more than a year we have been tracking a delivery mechanism built around\nvery small components created purely in assembly. It’s not entirely uncommon\nto see malware code created in such a way, however trends of recent years have\nbeen towards the usage and adoption of high-level languages (C/C++/C#/Delphi/\nJava/GO etc) rather than low-level coding. Generally, with high bandwidth internet\nconnections and powerful desktops there is little benefit in putting extra effort into\nhand crafting assembly: the difference in both delivery and execution time won’t\ngenerally be noticeable. Still, it was evident that someone still has a taste for more\ntraditional methods of writing malware.\n\n###### Delivery\nDuring our investigation we haven’t come across samples being delivered as the\nprimary payload (or email attachment) of an attack. Instead, they’ve been delivered as\nan additional payload alongside well-known banking trojan families such as Emotet\nor IcedID. Long term tracking provided us the opportunity to gather various samples\nand components of the Tiny ecosystem, as a result we have now analyzed over\n2000 unique samples. These components fall into four main categories: ‘loaders’,\n‘mappers’, ‘cleaners’ and ‘scrapers’, with loaders reflecting about 95% of the total\npopulation and all of the components falling into the 2-7kb range. We will elaborate\nmore on the function of the different components later.\n\n\n##### Forcepoint X-Labs has been collecting samples of Point-of-Sale (POS) malware that stood out for their hand crafted nature, were written in assembly code and were very small in size (2-7kB).\n\n\n-----\n\nTinyPOS: An analysis of a Point-of-Sale malware ecosystem [forcepoint.com](https://www.forcepoint.com/)\n\n###### How it works\n\n**The loader**\nIt all starts with the delivery of a small loader called TinyLoader, an obfuscated\nexecutable with simple – yet powerful – downloader functionality. Upon execution,\nit will first brute force its own decryption key (a 32- bit value, meaning this takes a\nfraction of second on modern PCs) before using this to decrypt the main\nprogram code.\n\nThe core functionality of the decrypted code is communication with a set of\nhardcoded C2 servers by IP and port. If the C2 is active, it will provide what is\neffectively a piece of shellcode, encrypted by another 32-bit constant. This shellcode\nis not ‘fire and forget’: it instead sees the loader establish a semi-interactive two-way\ncommunication with the C2.\n\n[Note that the earliest traits and mentions of TinyLoader go back to as far as 2015.](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/AbaddonPOS-A-New-Point-Of-Sale-Threat-Linked-To-Vawtrak)\n\n**The shellcode**\nThe shellcode’s first action is to download snippets of a longer piece of code into\nmemory in multiple steps, concatenate them, and execute the resulting program\nonce the code is complete.\n\nThe first payload built this way enumerates through the process list of the victim’s PC,\nflagging every process which is not included in a hardcoded blacklist. This blacklist\nconsists mainly of system process names stored in a shortened four-character\nlong format. The list of processes is then sent back to the C2 and the loader begins\nbuilding another piece of in-memory shellcode.\n\nThis second piece of code is an HTTP-based downloader that awaits further\nparameters that specify what to download, from where, and where to save it on the\nlocal system. Often the executable downloaded here is another TinyLoader pointing\nto yet another IP/port combination. This method seems to serve no specific purpose\nother than making the execution chain longer and potentially breaking dynamic\nanalysis environments. If the victim’s PC meets the desired criteria – for example it’s a\nPOS system – then another payload will be delivered and executed.\n\n\n-----\n\nTinyPOS: An analysis of a Point-of-Sale malware ecosystem [forcepoint.com](https://www.forcepoint.com/)\n\n\n**The POS payload - scrapers**\nCode-wise the POS component is very similar to the loader, except there is no\nadditional encryption, as whenever it is delivered the operators are almost certain due to the pre-filtering above - that a valuable target has been identified.\nThis component works like any other POS memory scraper: opening processes based\non either a predefined black or whitelist of process names, creating a new thread\n[for each matching one and scanning their full memory range for Track 1 and Track 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_7813)\n[credit card data. If such data is found, first it will be verified by the Luhn algorithm for](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm)\nintegrity, then it will be encrypted by a pre-defined key (another 32 or 64-bit value\nstored in the POS binary itself) and either sent to yet another C2 identified, again, by\nIP/port combination or it will be saved locally.\n\nNote the process name – the one data was stolen from - added at the end of\nthe record.\n\n**The mappers**\nThere is a special component type that we have chosen to call ‘mappers’. Their main\npurpose is to gather information about the PC and the environment it was executed\non. That’s done by making a map of active processes (either all running processes\nor just those from a pre-defined black or whitelist, depending on the sample) and\nlooking for local system (i.e. Autorun registry keys, Image path for active processes)\nand network related information. Processes are flagged differently depending on\nwhether they could be opened or not.\n\nFor the network reconnaissance capability, the execution of the ‘net view’ command\nwas implemented in a non-standard way by utilizing named pipes instead of simply\nexecuting a command shell. We believe ‘mappers’ help the operators gather\nextensive knowledge of different POS system layouts and also to deploy campaigns\ntargeting only specific retailers.\n\n\n###### Example of Track 1 data: %B4XXXXXXXXXXXXXX2^DOE/JO HN^13051010000000010000000 03000000?\n\n Example of Track 2 data: ;5XXXXXXXXXXXX XX2=1103101000000300001?\n\n Example of stolen Track 2 data before encryption: 4000000000000002=190110100 00012300000 *test_pos.exe\n\n\n**Figure 2: Example of the process blacklist embedded into shellcode**\n\n\nSome of the mapping samples contain no less than 200+ unique POS process\nnames in their embedded whitelist. To put that into perspective, a merchant will\ntypically buy one model of POS terminal to use across their business, with these\nsolutions generally covering both hardware and software components. As there are\nno trial editions of POS software bundles freely available on the internet, gathering\ninsights of the components is no easy job. Judging by the sheer numbers, it’s safe\nto assume that many years of background research and information gathering is\n\n\n-----\n\nTinyPOS: An analysis of a Point-of-Sale malware ecosystem [forcepoint.com](https://www.forcepoint.com/)\n\n**The cleaners**\nAs their name suggests, these components are responsible for cleaning up leftover\ncontent once the operation was finished. Such content can be running processes,\nAutorun registry keys, scheduled tasks and files in specific folders on the filesystem.\nJust like mappers, these modules are also customized for specific needs and won’t\nalways include every type of cleanup. Some would only kill a specific process and\ndelete the corresponding executable while others might do all and also send the\nreport of the successful – or failed - cleaning back to a C2.\n\n**Obfuscation and anti-analysis techniques**\nWhile the individual components of the Tiny ecosystem can hardly be considered\nchallenging from an analysis standpoint, they still utilize some basic obfuscation and\nanti-debug tricks. Note that not all of the techniques are utilized by every component,\nthe early stage downloaders were meant to be protected more. Some techniques\nwhich were identified are as follows:\n\n→ Call / Push obfuscation\n\n→ Fake API calls\n\n→ Junk instructions\n\n→ Imports by hash\n\n→ Icon resource randomization\n\n→ VS_VERSION_INFO randomization\n\n→ Dynamic loading of all imported API functions\n\n→ Simple encryption layer added after compilation\n\n\n**Figure 3: Example of Call / Push obfuscation**\n\n\n-----\n\nTinyPOS: An analysis of a Point-of-Sale malware ecosystem [forcepoint.com](https://www.forcepoint.com/)\n\n###### The infrastructure\nThere are more than a dozen IP addresses utilized by the operators, however most\nused in older campaigns are either out of service or have been recycled by now. Even\nthough the ports used to change frequently (sometimes within a day) the IPs for\nongoing campaigns are static. There are certain port numbers reserved for specific\nactivities; for example port 17771 is always used by the memory scraper modules for\ndata exfiltration.

Lots of POS\napplications are still based on POSReady 2009 (Windows XP based) or POSReady 7\n(Windows 7 based) platforms, both of these are reaching their EOL in the upcoming\nmonths or years (see table below).\n\nThere is a new Windows 10 based POS platform called Windows IoT Enterprise, but\nmigration and license costs can be challenging for many merchants.\n\n**PRODUCT** **EXTENDED SUPPORT END DATE**\n\n###### Windows Embedded POSReady 2009 4/9/2019\n\n Windows Embedded POSReady 7 10/12/2021\n\n Windows 10 IoT Enterprise 2015 LTSB 10/14/2025\n\n Windows 10 IoT Enterprise 2019 LTSC 1/9/2029\n\nOn top of that, POS systems often have some sort of remote access application\ninstalled for remote management and troubleshooting. This could enlarge the attack\nsurface as lost, stolen or unchanged default credentials might provide access for the\nadversaries. In certain cases, if standard database engines are deployed and data is\nstill stored without any encoding or encryption, it might also provide the ability for the\nmemory scraper module to not only intercept current transactions but also historical\nones. Several TinyPOS samples contains SQL and MySQL related names (“sqlser”,\n“mysqld“) in their process whitelist.\n\n**The hardware side**\nOn the other side, hardware-based restrictions and outdated standards are an even\ngreater concern. Magnetic strips (Track 1/2 type of data) are still being utilized due to\nthe lack of EMV support world-wide. The EMV standard was originally written about\n25 years ago, but adoption is much slower than expected.\n\n**The liability factor**\nThere are numerous types of credit card fraud, with POS-based theft making up only\none, shrinking piece of the whole. As total loss climbed up into the range of billions of\n[dollars, banks were looking for a way to shift liability over to the merchants. In reality](https://www.creditcardinsider.com/learn/chip-and-signature-chip-and-pin-emv-cards/#who-s-responsible-for-fraud-with-emv-cards)\nthis means since 1 January 2005 (EU) and 1 October 2015 (U.S.) merchants\n[are liable for all non EMV based transactions. As a result, adoption of EMV has](https://www.emvco.com/about/deployment-statistics/)\nincreased momentum in the EU, but it is still lagging behind in other regions (mainly\nU.S. and Asia).\n\n**The human factor**\nAn unfortunate side effect in the form of human (im)patience is also contributing\nto slower adoption of EMV. Swiping of a card is a quick and convenient way of\nmaking payments compared to entering at least four digits on a keypad. There are\ncertain regions of the globe where people are reluctant to remember yet another\nPIN and don’t wish to be slowed down by the process. For them, new and emerging\ncontactless payment methods will be welcome. While some of these are still asking\nfor a PIN for transactions over a certain limit such as PayPass (and that limit mayvary\n\n|PRODUCT|EXTENDED SUPPORT END DATE|\n|---|---|\n|Windows Embedded POSReady 2009|4/9/2019|\n|Windows Embedded POSReady 7|10/12/2021|\n|Windows 10 IoT Enterprise 2015 LTSB|10/14/2025|\n|Windows 10 IoT Enterprise 2019 LTSC|1/9/2029|\n\n\n-----\n\nTinyPOS: An analysis of a Point-of-Sale malware ecosystem [forcepoint.com](https://www.forcepoint.com/)\n\n\n**The connectivity issue**\nPOS terminals can utilize different ways of communication for both in and outbound\nconnections. Depending on the nature of the retailer, some might have strictly\nEthernet cabling, but the likelihood of using Wi-Fi and 3/4G based communication\nis becoming more widespread. There are certain scenarios, i.e. taxis, where cabling\nis just not an option. Also, depending on the total number of terminals used and the\nnetwork infrastructure, there might be servers dedicated to proxy requests towards\nthe bank instead of every terminal having a direct connection. Whenever there is an\nunfiltered direct internet connection, there is a higher risk of data exfiltration\ngoing unnoticed.\n\n###### Forks of a common codebase\nOne of the obvious questions is whether TinyPOS and PinkKite are really different\nmalware families. The short answer is no, they are not different malware families.\nWhile it wouldn’t take a significant amount of time for cybercriminals to recreate the\nassembly source code of the components by reversing existing samples, there are\ncertain improvements to the codebase - especially to the memory scraper code –\nwhich can be found in both.\n\nThe main difference lies in the method of data exfiltration. TinyPOS variants aim for\ndirect exfiltration over the internet, connecting to a pre-defined C2 and encrypting\ncredit card data by a 32-bit key. The PinkKite approach is used in scenarios where\ndirect exfiltration is not an option. Under such circumstances credit card data will be\neither stored on the local filesystem or the local network and encryption is done by a\n64-bit key. The exfiltration process will be manual and will require persistence on the\ngiven system to access the previously saved data. As many PinkKite samples contain\ninternal network addresses along with login credentials, it’s safe to assume operators\nof the malware are gaining these by hacking into target systems after the initial\nreconnaissance stage.\n\n**Figure 4: Example of code evolution in the memory scraper module**\n\n\n##### All of the factors mentioned on the left, are in play when it comes to a merchant’s ability – and willingness – to protect against POS based attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\nTinyPOS: An analysis of a Point-of-Sale malware ecosystem [forcepoint.com](https://www.forcepoint.com/)\n\n###### Protecting against POS fraud\n\n**Individuals**\nFirst of all, you should make sure that your credit or debit card is EMV compliant. If\nit’s not then your only option is to use the magnetic strip and most of the time that\nalso requires you to hand over your card to a 3rd party. Reaching out to the issuer\nof the card and negotiating a replacement – EMV-based, or one even supporting\ncontactless payment - prior to the original expiration date is highly advised.\n\n**Merchants**\nThe most important thing is to confirm the various connectivity options to and from\nthe POS terminals prior to securing other aspects of the network. If the only option for\nterminals to reach out to the bank is through a proxy and no direct internet connection\nis provided, that can greatly reduce the chance of immediate data exfiltration. Also, in\ncase maintaining and upgrading the terminals is handled by an external party, try to\nlimit having open ports only for the duration of the scheduled sessions.\n\n###### Conclusion\nAs we can see it doesn’t take hundreds or thousands of kilobytes of code to steal\nvaluable credit card data on a large scale. The Tiny ecosystem is built from simple yet\neffective components – each one being responsible for a dedicated task – written in a\nlow-level programming language that only very few programmers (i.e. people working\nwith embedded systems) consider their ‘weapon of choice’.\n\nWhile Swipe-and-Sign exists as an authentication option for card-present\ntransactions, POS malware like TinyPOS will continue to be effective. We strongly\nrecommend that retailers and banks aggressively pursue a faster move to EMV (at\nleast Chip-and-Signature, preferably Chip-and-PIN).\n\nIt is also recommended that an audit be performed on any system storing and\ntransmitting personal data in relation to how that data is managed and stored. The\ngoal should be to make it harder for credit card data to be extracted from the retailer’s\nsystems. This includes while in transit.\n\n\n-----\n\nTinyPOS: An analysis of a Point-of-Sale malware ecosystem [forcepoint.com](https://www.forcepoint.com/)\n\n###### Indicators of Compromise
