    "plain_text": "# NSA: Russia's Sandworm Hackers Have Hijacked Mail Servers\n\n**[wired.com/story/nsa-sandworm-exim-mail-server-warning/](https://www.wired.com/story/nsa-sandworm-exim-mail-server-warning/)**\n\nAndy Greenberg May 28, 2020\n\nA warning that hackers are exploiting vulnerable email servers doesn't qualify as an unusual\nevent in general. But when that warning comes from the National Security Agency, and the\nhackers are some of the most dangerous state-sponsored agents in the world, run-of-the-mill\nemail server hacking becomes significantly more alarming.\n\nOn Thursday, the NSA issued an advisory that the Russian hacker group known as\nSandworm, a unit of the GRU military intelligence agency, has been actively exploiting a\nknown vulnerability in Exim, a commonly used mail transfer agent—an alternative to bigger\nplayers like Exchange and Sendmail—running on email servers around the world. The\nagency warns that Sandworm has been exploiting vulnerable Exim mail servers since at\nleast August 2019, using the hacked servers as an initial infection point on target systems\nand likely pivoting to other parts of the victim's network. And while the NSA hasn't said who\nthose targets have been, or how many there are, Sandworm's history as one of the most\naggressive and destructive hacking organizations in the world makes any new activity from\nthe group worth noting.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe still consider this to be one of the most, if not the most aggressive and potentially\ndangerous actor that we track,\" says John Hultquist, the director of intelligence at FireEye,\nwho also led a team at iSight Partners when that company first discovered and named\nSandworm in 2014.\n\nHultquist notes that Sandworm, whose identity as Unit 74455 of the GRU was confirmed for\nthe first time by the US and UK governments in February, was responsible for blackoutinducing cyberattacks in Ukraine in 2015 and 2016, the NotPetya worm that inflicted an\nunprecedented $10 billion in damage globally in 2017, and also the attacks on multiple US\nstate election boards in 2016 that represented one element of Russia's meddling in the\npresidential election that year. \"The election is right around the corner, and this is an actor\nthat was involved in the 2016 incidents. We’re very concerned they’ll be involved again in\nthis election,\" says Hultquist. \"This is an actor that’s been involved in election-related hacking\nin the past and the most important, destructive attack in history. Any development involving\nthem is worth watching.\"\n\nAccording to the NSA, Sandworm has used a vulnerability in the mail transfer agent Exim,\nrevealed in June of last year, that allows an attacker to merely send a malicious email to the\nserver and immediately gain the ability to run code on the server remotely. In its intrusions,\nthe NSA warns, Sandworm has used that foothold to add its own privileged users to the\nserver, disable network security settings, update secure shell configurations to give its\nhackers more remote access, and run a script on the server to enable further steps to\nexploiting the target network.\n\nIt's not clear from the advisory what Sandworm's motivation may be in its mail server attacks\n—whether the ultimate intention of the hackers has been espionage, the sort of hacking-andleaking operation the GRU carried out in 2016, or reconnaissance for the sort of sabotage\n[attacks it has used against everyone from Ukrainian government agencies and utilities to the](https://www.wired.com/story/russian-hackers-attack-ukraine/)\n[2018 Olympics. But Jake Williams, a former NSA hacker and founder of the security firm](https://www.wired.com/story/untold-story-2018-olympics-destroyer-cyberattack/)\nRendition Infosec, says that a vulnerable mail server represents a powerful pivot point for\nhackers, since it's both exposed to the internet and can allow them to dig deeper into the\nnetwork once the server is compromised. \"Once you’re inside the perimeter, it can talk to\neverything,\" Williams adds. A hacked mail server can also intercept all incoming mail, and in\nsome cases allow hackers to dig through historical mail archives as well: \"From an attacker\nstandpoint, it puts you in a very good position in the network to cause all kinds of mischief. \"\n\nWilliams also says that despite the vulnerability having been patched last summer, he's\nfound in his own security assessments that mail transfer agents often lack updates, in part\nbecause administrators are reluctant to take email systems offline to patch them: \"We see a\nlot of patching deficit in mail servers.\" What's more, Williams recalls noting at the time the\nExim bug was exposed that it represented a particularly tempting vulnerability for intruders.\n“This vulnerability is absolutely trivial to exploit,” he says.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe NSA recommends that administrators patch their Exim software immediately, comb their\ntraffic logs for signs of exploitation, and segment their networks to make it harder for\nintruders to exploit their initial compromise of a mail server. But the naming of Sandworm\nspecifically as the group exploiting the Exim bug may also be part of a larger effort to call out\nand deter the GRU's wanton hacking activities. In February, the US State Department and\nthe UK's National Cybersecurity Center jointly condemned Sandworm's cyberattacks on the\n[country of Georgia that took down thousands of websites, as well as TV broadcasters last](https://www.wired.com/story/us-blames-russia-gru-sweeping-cyberattacks-georgia/)\nfall. Those statements also represented the first government confirmation of Sandworm's\nidentity as Unit 74455 of the GRU, a part of its Main Center for Special Technologies, or\nGTsST.\n\n\"They've shown a repeated willingness to flout international norms, and they’ve been\ninvolved in some of the most effective attacks in history,\" says FireEye's Hultquist. If the\nWest hopes to hold Russia to those norms ahead of the 2020 election, among other potential\ntargets, better perhaps to call out a rash of mail server hacking now than to wait for an\nOctober surprise.\n\nMore Great WIRED Stories\n\n[How to sleep when the world is falling apart](https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-sleep-anxiety/?itm_campaign=BottomRelatedStories_Sections_3&itm_content=footer-recirc)\nWhy humans totally [freak out when they get lost](https://www.wired.com/story/why-humans-totally-freak-out-when-they-get-lost/?itm_campaign=BottomRelatedStories_Sections_3&itm_content=footer-recirc)\nSilicon Valley [rethinks the (home) office](https://www.wired.com/story/silicon-valley-rethinks-home-office-twitter-slack/?itm_campaign=BottomRelatedStories_Sections_3&itm_content=footer-recirc)\n26 Animal Crossing tips to [up your island game](https://www.wired.com/story/animal-crossing-new-horizons-tips/?itm_campaign=BottomRelatedStories_Sections_3&itm_content=footer-recirc)\n[Covid-19's scary blood clots aren't that surprising](https://www.wired.com/story/covid-19s-scary-blood-clots-arent-that-surprising/?itm_campaign=BottomRelatedStories_Sections_3&itm_content=footer-recirc)\n👁 Is the brain a [useful model for AI?
