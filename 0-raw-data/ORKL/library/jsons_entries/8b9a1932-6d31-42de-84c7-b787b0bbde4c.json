A partial analysis of the \"GermanWiper\"\nRansomware\n\n[Today someone posted about a Ransomware attack on the local chat plaform Jodel (don't](https://jodel.com/)\njudge please, as you know the sketchy corners of the web get you the best samples :D)\nwhich instantly peaked my interest. What I got was this email and the two attached files.\n\nThe two attached files Applicant Name - Lebenslauf Aktuell.doc.lnk and Applicant Name _Arbeitszeugnisse Aktuell.doc.lnk are made to look like Microsoft Office Documents but are_\nactually just Windows File Shortcuts and can easily be parsed with the LNK Parser @\nGoogle Code. The output looks like this:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe person who provided me with this data was kind enough to also include the ransom\nnote, which is, unlike most ransomware strains out there in the wild wild cyber west, not a txt\nFile but rather a HTML file. It includes links to bitcoin exchanges, a hardcoded wallet address\nand asks for 0.15038835 BTC as a ransom. Just like the E-Mail it is written in spotless\n[german but without Umlauts (ä,ö,ü). A cleaned sample can be found here Communication](https://dissectingmalwa.re/other/clean.html)\nwith the attacker's server at 173.33.106.120 (hosted at OVH) is done via a php script at the\nbottom of the ransom note. Since the server was not reachable at the time of analysis I could\nnot take a closer look at neither the script nor the dropped .hta file that is run via the\npowershell command in the .lnks.\n\nThe most worrying thing about this sample is the \"encryption\" though. Every file touched by\n_GermanWiper is overwritten with zeros. A list of file extensions used by the wiper can be_\nfound on [pastebin. Because of this behaviour the malware was dubbed \"GermanWiper\" by](https://pastebin.com/rUGpEBfD)\n[Michael Gillespie (@Demonslay335). The BleepingComputer Forum post discussing this](https://twitter.com/demonslay335)\n[strain can be found here.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/t/701735/germanwiper-ransomware-with-random-extensions-08kja-avco3-oqn1b/)\n\n\n-----\n\nA not-so-Happy Ending: Encrypted files will not be recoverable and if you are a victim please\nspend your money somewhere else and not on the ransom.\n\n## Update: A look at the dropped executable\n\nGermanWiper available @ https://malshare.com/sample.php?\naction=detail&hash=36ccd442755d482900b57188ae3a89a7 sha256\n_41364427dee49bf544dcff61a6899b3b7e59852435e4107931e294079a42de7c_\n\n\n-----\n\nAs a first step I like to run my samples through \"Detect it easy\" to get a first look at what to\nexpect. Not a huge discovery, but it interesting none the less that the executable was likely\ncompiled with Visual Studio 2010.\n\n\n-----\n\nLet's check the entropy of the sample to see if it is packed. Heavy obfuscation is a rare sight\nfor ransomware, but running your executable through a packer or crypter of some sort might\navoid detection through already existing signatures and ransom campaigns often ship more\nthan one version of their executable.\n\n\n-----\n\nA quick test to see how much effort the attackers have put into it is to try to unpack it with\nupx, but no such luck in this case:\n\nI'm not quite sure why, but the attackers set an Amazon Logo as a file icon for the malware.\nMaybe to lure the victim into clicking on it ?\n\nWith\n\nthis sample we also get to see a new domain for a control server at\nexpandingdelegation[.]top (8.208.13.24) in the ransom note, so this sample might already be\npart of a second wave since it was still dropping the executable today (02.08.2019).\n\n\n-----\n\nA couple of noteworthy events after running the sample in a virtual machine: The\nRansomware runs vssadmin.exe to delete system restore points and shadow copies.\nFurthermore this command will disable recovery options at system startup, but not without\nfirst asking the victim for their approval first (how nice of them).\n\nThe seemingly arbitrary\n\nprocess description of the GermanWiper process might be a handy string to keep in mind for\nidentification of samples in the future.\n\nTo display the ransomnote after system startup it creates two entries in the start menue..\n\n..and an entry to open the html\n\nRansom-File in the msconfig autostart.\n\n\n-----\n\n## IOCs\n\n### Files\n```\nwiper.exe --SHA1--> 8cd96603cdd2637cf5469aba8ed2b149c35ef699\nArbeitszeugnisse - Lebenslauf - Doris Sammer.zip --SHA1-->\n058ad51c8eb86545a5424c0b021235da3bbce1c8\nDoris Sammer - Arbeitszeugnisse Aktuell.doc.lnk --SHA1-->\n2d8f89693d14b9ea7a056bced983dfc88fe76105\nDoris Sammer - Lebenslauf Aktuell.doc.lnk --SHA1-->\n77d5224fc02999b04ab79054aad23b0f6213b7eb\n\n Malspam Domains\napplicant.name[at]rasendmail.com\napplicant.name[at]stadtmailer.com\napplicant.name[at]nrwmail.com\napplicant.name[at]mailplatz.com\n\n Dropper URLs/IPs\n173.33.106[.]120\nmoneymaker[.]software\nexpandingdelegation[.]top\n\n Skipped Folders and Filenames\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\nautorun.inf\nboot.ini\nbootfont.bin\nbootsect.bak\ndesktop.ini\niconcache.db\nntldr\nntuser.dat\nntuser.dat.log\nntuser.ini\nbootmgr\nbootnxt\nthumbs.db\nWindows\nrecycle.bin\nmozilla\ngoogle\nboot\napplication data\nappData\nprogram files\nprogram files (x86)\nprogramme\nprogramme (x86)\nprogramdata\nperflogs\nintel\nmsocache\nSystem Volume Information\n\n```\n[Thanks again to @Demonslay335,](https://twitter.com/demonslay335) [@James_inthe_box and all the other researchers who](https://twitter.com/James_inthe_box)\ncontributed to the anlysis of this threat.
