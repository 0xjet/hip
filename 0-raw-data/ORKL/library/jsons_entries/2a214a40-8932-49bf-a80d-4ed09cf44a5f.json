Additionally, all strings are encrypted and Windows API function calls are\nobfuscated, while anti-execution measures also exist.\n\n**Windows API call obfuscation** _(ESET)_\nPersistence is achieved by adding a new registry entry to\n“Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run”, while the newly created directories that\nhost the malware components are marked as “hidden” and “system.”\n\nThe additions of this new version are spotted on the RAT aspect of Korplug, where its\nauthors have added more commands and features.\n\nThe commands supported by the first handler of the particular Korplug variant are the\nfollowing:\n\n**Ping – start listening for commands**\n**GetSystemInfo – gather and send system information**\n**ListenThread – start a new threat that listens for commands for the second handler**\n**ResetConnection – reset connection to C2**\n**Uninstall – delete added registry keys, remove all malware components and delete**\nthe created folders\n**Stop – disable registry key and exit**\n\nThe second handler listens to a different set of commands that concern the RAT’s\nfunctionality and are thus more advanced than the first set, which is used for basic\nreconnaissance.\n\nThe list of this second group is extensive, but some indicative examples are commands to\nlist drives and directories, read and write files, execute commands on a hidden desktop,\nand start an interactive remote cmd.exe session.\n\n\n-----\n\nESET believes Mustang Panda will continue to improve its toolset, making it more potent\nand stealthy, while special attention has to be paid to phishing emails that appear very\nrealistic.\n\nBeing a Chinese actor that has shown signs of serving higher political espionage interests,\nits targeting scope should remain relatively stable.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Chinese state-backed hackers now target Russian state officers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/chinese-state-backed-hackers-now-target-russian-state-officers/)\n\n[Hackers target Russian govt with fake Windows updates pushing RATs](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-target-russian-govt-with-fake-windows-updates-pushing-rats/)\n\n[New stealthy Nerbian RAT malware spotted in ongoing attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-stealthy-nerbian-rat-malware-spotted-in-ongoing-attacks/)\n\n[Emotet botnet switches to 64-bit modules, increases activity](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/emotet-botnet-switches-to-64-bit-modules-increases-activity/)\n\n[Phishing campaign targets Russian govt dissidents with Cobalt Strike](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/phishing-campaign-targets-russian-govt-dissidents-with-cobalt-strike/)\n\n[China](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/china/)\n[Cyber-espionage](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/cyber-espionage/)\n[Mustang Panda](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/mustang-panda/)\n[Phishing](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/phishing/)\n[RAT](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/rat/)\n[ta416](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ta416/)\n[Trojan](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/trojan/)\n\n[Bill Toulas](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/bill-toulas/)\n\nBill Toulas is a technology writer and infosec news reporter with over a decade of\nexperience working on various online publications.
