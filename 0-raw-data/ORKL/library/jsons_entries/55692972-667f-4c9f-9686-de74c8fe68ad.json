Governments are doing their best to mitigate such a virus while people are stuck home working\nremotely using their own equipment.\n\nIn that scenario, jackals are luring people using every dirty way to attack their private devices. At home it’s hard to have advanced protection\nsystems as we have in companies. For example it’s hard to have Intrusion Prevention Systems, proxies, advanced threat protection,\nautomated sandbox and again advanced end-point protections letting personal devices more vulnerable to be attacked. In this reality ruthless\nattackers abuse of this situation to attack digitally unprotected people.\n\nToday many reports are describing how infamous attackers are abusing such an emergency time to lure people by sending thematic email\ncampaign or by using thematic IM within Malware or Phishing links. Following few of them that I believe would be a nice reading:\n\n[Today I want to contribute to such a blog-roll analyzing a new spreading variant that hit my observatory. I want to “spoil” the conclusions now,](https://marcoramilli.com/cyber-threat-trends/)\nbut it’s getting pretty sad if an APT group makes use of its knowledge to take advance from today’s situation.\n\n## Stage 1\n\nThe first stage is a fake PDF file. It looks like a real PDF, it has a hidden extension and a nice PDF icon, but it really isn’t a PDF, it’s actually a\n.lnk file, or in other words a “Microsoft Linking File”.\n\nSha256 95489af84596a21b6fcca078ed10746a32e974a84d0daed28cc56e77c38cc5a8\n\nThreat Dropper and Execution\n\nSsdeep 24576:2D9JuasgfxPmNirQ2dRqZJuH3eBf9mddWoX+KIKoIkVrI:2DzuOxPm0iZLKIKRkq\n\nDescription Fake PDF file used to run initial infection chain\n\nOpening up the .lnk file we might appreciate a weird linking pattern. Two main sections: one is a kind of header where it is possible to observe\ncommands, and the other section is a big encoded payload.\n\n\n-----\n\n.lnk file\nOnce beautified the first section it looks easier to understand what it does. It basically copies itself into a temporary folder (through `cmd.exe ),`\nit extracts bytes from its body (from section two), it decodes such a bytes from Byte64 (through `msoia.exe ) and it places the extracted`\ncontent into the temporary user folder. It deflates the content (through `expand ) and it finally it executes a javascript file (through` `wscript )`\nwhich was included into the compressed content. The following image shows the beautified code section of the analyzed file.\n\nBeautified .lnk file\n\nIt is quite nice to see how the attacker copied `certutils from local system, by using` `(*ertu*.exe) in order to avoid command line`\ndetection from public sandboxes. Indeed many sandboxes have signatures on certutils, since it’s quite a notorious tool used by some\nattackers, so that avoiding the behavior signature match it would take a lower score from public sandboxes.\n\n## Stage 2\n\nStage 1 carved Stage 2 from its body by extracting bytes and decoding them using base64 encoding. The new stage is a Microsoft\ncompressed CAB file described in the following table.\n\nSha256 f74199f59533fbbe57f0b2aae45c837b3ed5e4f5184e74c02e06c12c6535f0f9\n\nThreat Malware Carrier/Packer/Compressor\n\nSsdeep 24576:CkL6X/3PSCuflrdNZ4J00ZcmNh3wsAR36Mge:vLK/fS200ZcYh3kqpe\n\nDescription Microsoft CAB bringing contents\n\nExtracting files from Microsoft CAB we observe 6 more files entering in the battlefield:\n```\n   20200308-sitrep-48-covid-19.pdf . The original PDF from WHO explaining the COVID-19 status and how to fight it.\n   3UDBUTNY7YstRc.tmp . PE32 Executable file (DLL)\n   486AULMsOPmf6W.tmp . PE32 Executable (GUI)\n   9sOXN6Ltf0afe7.js . Javascript file (called by .lnk)\n   cSi1r0uywDNvDu.tmp . XSL StyleSheet Document\n   MiZl5xsDRylf0W.tmp . Text file including PE32 file\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nStage e ecutes t e Ja asc pt c uded t e C e `9sO` `6 t 0a e` `js pe o` s a ct e Object ca to `Sc` `pt S e` o de\nto execute Windows command lists. Once” deobfuscated” and beautified the command line looks like the following (9sOXN6Ltf0afe7.js\npayload beautified) . The attacker creates a folder that looks like a “file” by calling it `cscript.exe trying to cheat the analyst. Then the`\nattacker populates that folder with the needed files to follow the infection chain.\n\n9sOXN6Ltf0afe7.js payload “deobfuscated”\n\n[A special thought goes to WINRM.VBS which helped the attacker to execute Signed Script Proxy Execution (T1216). According to Microsoft:](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/winrm/)\n“WINRM is the CLI interface to our WS-MGMT protocol. The neat thing about this is that you can call it from PowerShell to manage remote\nsystems that don’t have PowerShell installed on them (including Server Core systems and Raw hardware).” The attacker also places a file\ncalled `Wordcnvpxy.exe on the OFFICE12 folder. We will analyze it in a few steps but at that stage we might observe that is the “last call”`\nbefore luring the victim by showing the good PDF file (also included in the CAB). But according with `9sOXN6Ltf0afe7.js the first run is on`\n```\nWsmPty.xsl which is the renamed version of cSi1r0uywDNvDu.tmp .\n\n## Stage 3\n\n```\nStage 3 is run by stage 2 and it is a XSL (StleSheet Office file) wrapping a VBScript object.\n\nSha256 9d52d8f10673518cb9f19153ddbe362acc7ca885974a217a52d1ee8257f22cfc\n\nThreat Payload Extractor and Command Executor\n\nSsdeep 96:46Pdv3fOYCeeapSCDIKufYS2VGsBu746WJCSmCZyAcGghF:fh3fOYneaLDIgnNEFCZyAcGsF,\n\nDescription Decode Additional Stage by using coding charsets and XOR\n\nThe following VBScript is run through `cscript.exe, It’s an obfuscated and xor-encrypted payload. The encryption is performed by a simple`\nxor having as `key the single byte` `0 while the encoding procedure is a multi conversion routine which could be summarized as follows:`\n\n**chr(asc(chr(“&h”&mid(x,y,2))))**\n\n\n-----\n\nVBScript Stage3\nThe attacker tried to confuse the analyst by reusing variable names in private or local contexts, but after a couple of minutes, you might\neventually come out with the following decryption loop.\n\nDecryption Loop\n\nIf you run it against the embedded payload you will eventually see a new stage: Stage 4. A brand new script targeting old version of MSOffice.\n\n## Stage 4\n\nStage 4 is decoded and run by Stage 3. That stage runs an attacker version of MSOSTYLE.exe copied from Stage 2. It hijacks method on an\nold office 2007 component (Office Data Provider for – MSOSTYLE.exe).\n\nSha356 7f230a023a399b39fa1994c3eaa0027d6105769fffaf72918adebf584edc6fe0\n\nThreat Persistence and Execution\n\nSsdeep 48:zKxYaDzzXRrVHyMqHeIyJwlLGvTlGrbaTFGNT93TPTxGVhTG6TWWWsKj390C9nEm:zKxjDRt+e1sGvJG3aRGNNDtGLLqP5j3\n\nDescription Set persistence on the target system (Script File)\n\nThe following image shows the decrypted and decoded Stage. It’s quite clear the attacker wants to get persistence on the target machine and\nto run additional payload by abusing `MSOSTYLE.exe (old component) placed in the “right folder” from stage 2. The persistence is guaranteed`\nby adding a link called `Accessories.lnk inside the startup windows folder pointing to:` `MiZl5xsDRylf0W.tmp .`\n\n\n-----\n\nPowershell\n\nStage 4\n\n## Stage 5\n\nStage 5 is activated by Stage 2 but only after the execution of Stage 3 and Stage 4. Stage 5 is a multi-step session composed by the following\nadditional artifacts: (i) `3UDBUTNY7YstRc.tmp renamed by Stage 2 into` `OINFO12.OCX and (ii)` `MiZl5xsDRylf0W.tmp renamed by Stage 2`\ninto `Wordcnvpxy.exe . Every single artifact is available after the execution of Stage 2 into the crafted folder called:` `OFFICE12 from the user`\nhome.\n\nSha256 604679789c46a01aa320eb1390da98b92721b7144e57ef63853c3c8f6d7ea85d\n\nThreat Remote Control, depending on usage\n\nSsdeep 536:/4yuzgQ5WugrQ+SccIp1t4xO67y5qHae:gyuzgKwr9bB1t4xO67y5j,\n\nDescription Office Data Provider for WBEM, not malicious but accountable.\n\nMSOSTYLE.EXE is an old Microsoft Office Data Provider for WBEM. Web-Based Enterprise Management (WBEM) comprises a set of\nsystems-management technologies developed to unify the management of distributed computing environments. So it could not be considered\nmalicious, but it could be considered accountable of the entire infection chain.\n\nSha256 a49133ed68bebb66412d3eb5d2b84ee71c393627906f574a29247d8699f1f38e\n\nThreat PlugX Command Execution\n\n\n-----\n\nSsdeed 768:jxmCQWD+TAxTRh40XfEDDnFt4AczonsT:MC5bw+zosT\n\nDescription A runner plus Command Execution, Pluging Manager\n\nAt the time of writing only three AVs detect `OINFO12.OCX as a malicious file. Rising AV is actually the only company which attributes it to a`\n[well-known PlugX sample. According with Trend Micro, the PlugX malware family is well known to researchers having samples dating back to](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/plugx-new-tool-for-a-not-so-new-campaign/#)\nas early as 2008. PlugX is a fully featured Remote Access Tool/Trojan (RAT) with capabilities such as file upload, download, and modification,\nkeystroke logging, webcam control, and access to a remote cmd.exe shell.\n\nOINFO12.OCX VT coverage\nTaking it on static analysis it will expose three callable functions: DeleteOfficeData ( 0x10001020 ), GetOfficeData ( 0x10001000 ) and\n**EntryPoint** `0x100015ac ).`\n\nBoth of the methods DeleteOfficeData and GetOfficeData looks like recalling a classic method to hijacking old Office Parser (take a look to\n[here and figure 3 in here ) to execute commands.](https://marcoramilli.com/2019/01/30/spreading-csv-malware-over-google-sheets/)\n\nDeleteOfficeData (0x10001020)\n\n**GetOfficeData ( 0x10001000 )**\n\nIndeed if run from its Entry Point, the DLL executes `Wordcnvpxy.exe (as it is the default plugin component). The executable DLL must be in`\nthe same path of `Wordcnvpxy.exe and it needs to have such a filename (imposed by Stage 2 and hardcoded into the library). On the other`\nside of the coin if commands are passed through stdin, it executes the given parameters as commands.\n\n\n-----\n\nNo Input Commands, Wordcnvpxy\n\nexecution\nThe following image shows when parameters are given and Commands are executed.\n\nCommands Execution\nFinally we have `Wordcnvpxy.exe which is run in the same stage (Stage 5) by` `OINFO12.OCX . At the time of writing, it is well-known from`\nstatic engines, it looks like a standard backdoor beacon-ing to own command and control installed as PlugX module.\n\n\n-----\n\nSha256 002c9e0578a8b76f626e59b755a8aac18b5d048f1cc76e2c12f68bc3dd18b124\n\nThreat PlugX, Backdoor\n\nSsdeep 1536:9/dlJMLIU94EYayTdHP6rUkn16O41yWCzB:93JsZxePUAFgWCz\n\nDescription Probably one of the last stages, beaconing VS C2 and executing external commands\n\nWordcnvpxy VT coverage\nThe sample uses dynamic function loading avoiding static enumeration and guessing. It grabs information on the victim, PC-name, username,\nIP-location and send them to C2 as a first beacon.\n\nDynamic Loading function calls\n\nThe used Command and Control resolves to the following URL `hxxp://motivation[.]neighboring[.]site/01/index.php`\n\nCommand and Control\n\nUnfortunately the attacker has shut down everything few hours after I started my analysis, so that I do not have more information about\n[network, commands and additional Plugins. However the overall structure reminds me PlugX RAT as nicely described here.](https://www.lastline.com/labsblog/an-analysis-of-plugx-malware/)\n\n## Attribution\n\n[According to MITRE (BTW thank you @Arkbird_SOLG for the great suggestions](https://twitter.com/Arkbird_SOLG) **on attribution) PlugX is a well known RAT attributed to**\nChina’s APT. **[APT27 (aka Emissary Panda) are the mostly notable APT group that used it. Moreover (thanks to @Arkbird_SOLG) “[…] on](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/actor/emissary_panda)**\nChina culture, hijacking method are a mandatory knowledge for a job like pentesting […]” which could enforce the theory of APT27\n\n\n-----\n\n**U** a a a e t at ug s today a ope sou ce, a d a a a e t at t s s ot e oug o att but o deed t e te t o t e\ntitle is to put doubts on that attribution by the usage of “?” (question mark). On one hand PlugX historically has been attributed to APT27 but on\nthe other hand it’s public. So it’s hard to say Yes or Not, for such a reason the intent of this blog post is: Is APT27 Abusing COVID-19 To Attack\nPeople ?!. It’s an Open question not a position.\n\nWe all are passing a bad time. COVID-19 caused many death and is threatening entire economies. Please, even if you are an attacker and\nyou gain profit from you infamous job, stop cyber attacks against peoples that are suffering this pandemic and rest. Ethics and compassion\n**should be alive – even behind you monitors.**\n\n## IoC\n\n95489af84596a21b6fcca078ed10746a32e974a84d0daed28cc56e77c38cc5a8 (original .lnk)\nf74199f59533fbbe57f0b2aae45c837b3ed5e4f5184e74c02e06c12c6535f0f9 (Stage 2)\n9d52d8f10673518cb9f19153ddbe362acc7ca885974a217a52d1ee8257f22cfc (Stage 3)\n7f230a023a399b39fa1994c3eaa0027d6105769fffaf72918adebf584edc6fe0 (Stage 4)\na49133ed68bebb66412d3eb5d2b84ee71c393627906f574a29247d8699f1f38e (Stage 5/a)\n002c9e0578a8b76f626e59b755a8aac18b5d048f1cc76e2c12f68bc3dd18b124 (Stage 5/b)\nhxxp://motivation[.]neighboring[.]site/01/index.php (C2)\n\n## Yara (auto)\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nrule MiZl5xsDRylf0W {\n  meta:\n   description = \"yara -
