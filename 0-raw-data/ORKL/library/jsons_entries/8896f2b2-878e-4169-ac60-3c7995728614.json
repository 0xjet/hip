We mainly focus on Iris, but the](https://www.domaintools.com/products/iris?utm_source=Blog&utm_campaign=IOC) [April edition also delved](https://www.domaintools.com/resources/webinars/hunting-threat-actors-lifts-my-spirits?utm_source=Blog&utm_campaign=IOC)\nbriefly into [PhishEye. We do these mini-training-sessions with recent adversary campaign](https://www.domaintools.com/products/phisheye?utm_source=Blog&utm_campaign=IOC)\ninfrastructure as the example data, often expanding beyond published indicator lists to find\nnew domains and IP addresses that are likely tied to identified campaigns (or clustered\nactivities that may or may not have formal campaign classifications).\n\nOh, and we quaff tasty beverages too.\n\nFor May, the beverage was the delicious but often cheaply-made Mai Tai. Here’s the recipe:\n\n\n-----\n\nIf you’re like me, most of the Mai Tais you’ve had over the years were almost certainly made\nfrom a pre-mix which was probably about 85% sugar. [The recipe above is from a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bazi0j_4RhM)\n[speakeasy in New York called PDT, and they know how to make drinks the right way.](http://www.pdtnyc.com/)\nSalud!\n\n## I’ve Finished My Investigation: Now What?\n\nThe training for May covered various ways to take the data you’ve developed in Iris and\nmake it available for further actions, which could range from the defensive (building\nfirewall/IPS rules, building detections) to the administrative (generating reports for\nmanagement, GRC, etc) to the collaborative (sharing investigations with other Iris users, or\nsharing indicators with trust groups or law enforcement). Iris provides five distinct ways to\nshare information.\n\nTo illustrate this, we looked at infrastructure related to a campaign FireEye has called\n[“Ghostwriter,” by a group they call UNC1151. It’s a cyber espionage group targeting several](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2021/04/espionage-group-unc1151-likely-conducts-ghostwriter-influence-activity.html)\nspecific countries, and a big part of their TTPs involves stealing credentials and then posing\nas the victims, posting on their social media accounts. They target victims of significance so\nas to spread their messages (mainly anti-NATO) as broadly as possible. We took a couple\n[of indicators posted by Kyle Ehmke on May 13, and expanded from them to develop a list of](https://twitter.com/kyleehmke)\ndozens of domains that have a lot in common with confirmed UNC1151 infrastructure. Many\nof these domains have not at this point been put on block lists, but their nefarious purposes\nare pretty clear.\n\n## Breadcrumbs, But With a Difference\n\n\n-----\n\nThe screenshot below shows the Search History in Iris. It forms a sort of breadcrumb trail of\neach pivot or new search you take during the course of your investigation. The nodes of the\ntrail can carry various pieces of information. In the example, we’ve got the first node in\nfocus, which has the two domains that Kyle posted on the 13th. Some of the other nodes\nhave a little number on them. That number shows one of the methods of sharing\ninformation in Iris: it represents the number of notes the investigator has pinned to that step\nof the investigation.\n\nIris Search History with annotated nodes\n\nOne of the nodes has the number 2 on it, and a star. The star can be added to any node to\ncall it out as significant, and the two notes (which we’ll see in a moment) give context on\nwhy that step of the investigation is useful.\n\n“But wait,” you might be thinking. “How is that sharing?” Here’s how: Iris allows you to share\nan investigation with other Iris users in your DomainTools group. If you work on a team and\nmore than one of you investigates infrastructure in Iris, the notes you create can be seen by\nyour co-investigators.\n\n\n-----\n\nInvestigation Share Button\n\n\n-----\n\nNotes for collaborators or\n\nfor documentation\n\nYou can share the investigation as read-only, read+add, or read+add+delete, depending on\nhow much control you want to give your colleagues.\n\n## Pass the Hash\n\n[No, that’s not a drug reference, nor is it a reference to a cyber adversary technique. Rather,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pass_the_hash)\nIris allows you to export a hash of any query, so that another Iris user who may not be part\nof your group can look at the same query that you ran. When you share in this way, the\nother party does not see investigation notes or any of your search history (breadcrumbs),\nbut they do see the results of the same query that you had made.\n\n\n-----\n\nSearch hash export and\n\nimport controls\n\n## Reporting for Duty\n\nSometimes a formal investigation report is required, whether for leadership, peers, or just\nas part of a documentation requirement in your organization. Iris allows you to generate a\n.pdf report that shows the investigative steps you took and various manifestations of the\ndata you uncovered, including indicator lists, search hashes, and detailed domain\ninformation. The description of the investigation (which you can see in the screenshot\nbelow) as well as any notes you added along the way are recorded in the .pdf report. A\n[sample report will be linked along with this blog for your perusal.](https://www.domaintools.com/content/iris-report-unc-1151-domains.pdf?utm_source=Blog&utm_campaign=IOC)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Machine-Readable Exports\n\nYou might also wish to share the indicators you developed in Iris with others who will use\nthe data programmatically. Iris allows you to export the data to a .csv file, or to STIX\nversions 1.2 or 2.0. The latter is particularly useful for users in ISACs or other trust groups.\nThe .csv export can be used for generation of detections or firewall rules. The .csv export’s\ncolumns will show whatever columns you have active in the Pivot Engine. For some use\ncases, you might choose to show only the domain and IP address columns, and for others\nyou might want everything.\n\n\n-----\n\nIris results exported as .csv\n\n## Choose Your Export\n\nWhich way you export or share data from Iris depends on your needs and whom you’re\nsharing the data with. Below is one way to think about it, but your own needs might\nrearrange some of the check marks.\n\n\n**Law**\n**Enforcement**\n\n\n**Leadership**\n**or GRC**\n\n\n**Trust**\n**Group**\n\n\n**Security**\n**Admins /**\n**DX**\n**Engineering**\n\n\n**Business**\n**Ecosystem**\n\n\n**Iris**\n**Users**\n**in**\n**Your**\n**Grou**\n\n\n**.pdf Report**\n\n\n**.csv Export**\n\n\n**STIX Export**\n\n\n**Query Hash**\n\n\n**Investigation**\n\n\nIf you missed the live IOC webinar, you can revisit it [here, and you can sign up for future](https://www.domaintools.com/resources/webinars/hunting-threat-actors-is-sub-lime?utm_source=Blog&utm_campaign=IOC)\n[installments here.
