While it is important to never click on the link(s) or download the\nattachment(s) of any suspicious email, if the recipient interacts with the link, it downloaded the malware Lampion.\n\nThe Lampion banking trojan has been around since 2019, but this is the first time it has been analyzed by the PDC. While\nit has not yet been determined who exactly is behind the malware, it is known for using a VBS loader. Fortunately, threat\nactors have been spotted by PDC analyst using a new form of delivery for that very VBS file. Using the trusted cloud\nplatform used for payments, WeTransfer, threat actors are attempting to gain the trust of users while taking advantage of\nthe service provided by the popular site. By leveraging a trusted payment site, it’s not surprising to see threat actors align\ntheir email message for this process. A well-conditioned user quickly reported this email that mitigated the threat of the\nmalware infection.\n\n_Figure 1: Email Body_\n_English translation: Good afternoon, I send proof of payment and documents on the link: hXXps://we[.]tl/t-pNvQIG8UJS I_\n_subscribe with high esteem and best regards_\n\nIn Figure 1, the threat actor used a very simple email message to engage the recipient. The strongest tactic taken would is\nspoofing a legitimate company, which could potentially be a result of compromised credentials. The email sent to the\nrecipient is sent a proof of payment and other documents, which are accessible at the URL hXXps://we[.]tl/t-pNvQIG8UJS.\nWhen the recipient interacts with the URL they are directed to the page where they can download a ZIP file containing the\ndocuments referenced in the email.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2: Contents of the ZIP File_\n\n_Figure 3: Strings from the First Wscript Process Once the ZIP file is downloaded, its contents can be extracted to reveal a_\nfolder containing the two files seen in Figure 2. The VBS file, Comprovativo de pagamento de fatura_517-TEG_22-082022 20-09-24_28.vbs, is the file of concern as this launches the script, to lead the malicious process. Next, it will initiate a\nwscript process. Analyzing the strings in the memory of this process will result in finding references to two different VBS\nfiles, seen in Figure 3. This initial process created these files in the AppData\\Local\\Temp and AppData\\Roaming\ndirectories. There are four VBS files created in total, each with random letters as a filename. The scripts in\nAppData\\Roaming are less relevant. One file appears to be empty or was deleted during the process while the other is\nsmall with minimal functionality. The script, xjfgxhakusp.vbs, in AppData\\Local\\Temp is far more important.\n\n_Figure 4: URLs Leading to DLLs\nWhile there are two VBS files in AppData\\Local\\Temp, the smaller script is only meant to_\ninitiate the other, larger script, xjfgxhakusp.vbs. It is a strange extra step taken by the threat actor. Upon running the larger\nscript, another wscript process is initiated. This second wscript process reaches out to the two payload URLs in Figure 4.\nBoth download the final DLL files. The bottom URL will download a password protected ZIP which holds the DLL, but the\npassword is hardcoded into the malicious process itself. The DLLs are then finally injected into the memory. As a banking\nTrojan, the Lampion mainly looks to steal the targets valuable information.\nWhile email security continues to evolve to protect the organization, threat actors are constantly looking for opportunities to\nland in the inbox. This is why it is critical to provide your users with simulations aligned with the latest threats. Customers\nof the Cofense PDC can ease or confirm their suspicions by reporting suspicious emails to the PDC where an analyst will\nanalyze the email for emerging threats.
