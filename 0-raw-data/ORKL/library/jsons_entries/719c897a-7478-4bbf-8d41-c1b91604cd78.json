    "plain_text": "# Teslacrypt Spam Campaign: “Unpaid Issue…”\n\n**[blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2016/03/teslacrypt-spam-campaign-unpaid-issue/](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2016/03/teslacrypt-spam-campaign-unpaid-issue/)**\n\nMalwarebytes Labs March 18, 2016\n\nWe have all seen the current upsurge in Ransomware attacks. It has been covered on an\ninternational scale, with new variants appearing at a very fast pace, some target Windows,\nsome target Macs and some have cross platform capabilities.\n\nRecently a major healthcare organization fell victim to Ransomware, and surely there are\nmore high profile victims to come. Enterprises face an ever growing threat landscape and the\nmajority of businesses do not report or acknowledge having become a victim of\nRansomware. This is due to the possible repercussions, such as loss of customer\nconfidence, degraded reputation and embarrassment, which leads to an inevitable loss of\nprofit and business.\n\nCyber-criminals are aware of these repercussions and have crafted their attacks to include\nthreats such as releasing specific information related to victims, as we saw with Chimera\nRansomware, utilizing a type of cyber-extortion to ensure they achieve their objective of\nbeing paid the ransom. Cyber criminals select targets that may give in to their demands, and\ntargeting a major health care organization is more than likely going to generate a paid\nransom.\n\n\n-----\n\nCyber criminals continue to use exploit kits to infect victims with ransomware but they also\nuse MALSPAM emails to lure possible victims – a key vector into an enterprise environment\nthat lacks the proper security controls, and one with insufficient information security training\nfor end users. Some examples are email messages claiming to be in regards to an overdue\nbill or invoice, utilizing such terminology in the subject line and given file name, such as\ninvoice.zip or payment_doc_298427.zip\n\nThe email seen below is an example how the orchestrated attack is carried out (thanks to\n[Conrad Longmore for the email example):](http://blog.dynamoo.com/)\n```\nFrom: Jennie bowles Date: 10 March 2016 at 12:27 Subject: GreenLand Consulting –\nUnpaid Issue No. 58833\nDear Client!

Upon\nrunning this specific malicious script/downloader I was greeted by Teslacrypt ransomware\n(69.exe) from hellomississmithqq[.]com / IP: 54.212.162.6 (both currently blocked by\nMalwarebytes Anti-Malware Malicious Website protection).\n\nObfuscated malicious script/downloader above\nMalicious script file: 858dc7fac3580c69d6086ac4d5d148a3\n\n\n-----\n\nFiddler capture showing download of 69.exe (Teslacrypt Ransomware file)\n\n**Teslacrypt file 69.exe: 1E0B12117190A08B89F4200CB79DAE5E**\n\nAfter 69.exe is downloaded by the malicious script downloader, it executes, encrypts\ntargeted files and issues an HTTP POST to its Command and Control.\n\nData sent to Command and Control about newly infected system\n\nNoted below are some of the associated domains / IPs identified from the above sample.\nThis Teslacrypt ransomware campaign has recently morphed into a hybrid Teslacrypt / Locky\nransomware campaign. The aforementioned domain hellomississmithqq[.]com was seen\nserving up both Teslacrypt and Locky Ransomware on 10 March 2016).\n\n**Identified command and control:**\n\nmultibrandphone[.]com\nvtechshop[.]net\nsappmtraining[.]com\nshirongfeng[.]cn\ncontrolfreaknetworks[.]com\ntele-channel[.]com\n\n**Associated IP addresses with hellomississmithqq[.]com:**\n\n46(dot)108.108.182\n54(dot)212.162.6\n78(dot)135.108.94\n134(dot)19.180.8\n202(dot)120.42.190\n216(dot)150.77.21\n142(dot)25.97.48\n202(dot)120.42.190\n\n**Other domains that have been identified in this on-going campaign:**\n\n\n-----\n\nJoecockerhereqq[.]com\nblizzbauta[.]com\nyesitisqqq[.]com\nhowareyouqq[.]com\nthisisitsqq[.]com\nblablaworldqq[.]com\nfromjamaicaqq[.]com\nhellomydearqq[.]com\nwitchbehereqq[.]com\narendroukysdqq[.]com\nitisverygoodqq[.]com\ngoonwithmazerqq[.]com\nhelloyoungmanqq[.]com\ninvoiceholderqq[.]com\nmafianeedsyouqq[.]com\nmafiawantsyouqq[.]com\nsoclosebutyetqq[.]com\nisthereanybodyqq[.]com\nlenovomaybenotqq[.]com\nlenovowantsyouqq[.]com\nhellomississmithqq[.]com\nthisisyourchangeqq[.]com\nwww.thisisyourchangeqq[.]com\ngutentagmeinliebeqq[.]com\nhellomisterbiznesqq[.]com\n\nRansomware is not going away, on the contrary it is becoming more and more prevalent with\nnew variants coming out at a fast pace and targeting multiple platforms.\nIt is recommended that users are using anti-malware protection, especially one that has a\n[website protection option. Malwarebytes has an Anti-Ransomware Beta product that blocks](https://forums.malwarebytes.org/topic/177751-introducing-malwarebytes-anti-ransomware/)\nmost Ransomware attacks. Furthermore it is recommended that users are ever vigilant and\nnot click on URL links in suspicious emails, and do not open any files contained in these\nemails. Ensure to keep proper backups as most Ransomware deletes Windows shadow\ncopies.\n\n[Malwarebytes Anti-Malware detects this Teslacrypt sample and its malicious website](https://www.malwarebytes.org/antimalware/)\nprotection blocks the download domain / Command & Control domains as well.\n\n[Andres](https://twitter.com/MlwrHpstr)\n\n\n-----",
