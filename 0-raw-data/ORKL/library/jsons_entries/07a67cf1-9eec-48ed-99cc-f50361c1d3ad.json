On\nMarch 17th, the same actors behind those attacks set up a new website with associated\n\n\n-----\n\nsocial media profiles for a fake company called SecuriElite.\n\nThe new website claims the company is an offensive security company located in Turkey that\noffers pentests, software security assessments and exploits. Like previous websites we’ve\nseen set up by this actor, this website has a link to their PGP public key at the bottom of the\n[page. In January, targeted researchers reported that the PGP key hosted on the attacker’s](https://twitter.com/richinseattle/status/1354088047520997390?s=20)\nblog acted as the lure to visit the site where a browser exploit was waiting to be triggered.\n\nSecuriElite website\n\nThe attacker’s latest batch of social media profiles continue the trend of posing as fellow\nsecurity researchers interested in exploitation and offensive security. On LinkedIn, we\nidentified two accounts impersonating recruiters for antivirus and security companies. We\nhave reported all identified social media profiles to the platforms to allow them to take\nappropriate action.\n\n\n-----\n\nActor controlled LinkedIn profiles\n\nActor controlled Twitter profiles\n\nTweet from SecuriElite announcing new company\n\nAt this time, we have not observed the new attacker website serve malicious content, but we\n[have added it to Google Safebrowsing as a precaution.](https://safebrowsing.google.com/)\n\n[Following our January blog post, security researchers successfully identified these actors](https://enki.co.kr/blog/2021/02/04/ie_0day.html)\nusing an Internet Explorer 0-day. Based on their activity, we continue to believe that these\nactors are dangerous, and likely have more 0-days. We encourage anyone who discovers a\n\n\n-----\n\nChrome vulnerability to report that activity through the Chrome Vulnerabilities Rewards\nProgram submission process.\n\n## Actor controlled sites and accounts\n\n**Fake Security Company Website:**\n\nwww.securielite[.]com\n\n**Twitter Profiles:**\n\nhttps://twitter.com/alexjoe9983\nhttps://twitter.com/BenH3mmings\nhttps://twitter.com/chape2002\nhttps://twitter.com/julia0235\nhttps://twitter.com/lookworld0821\nhttps://twitter.com/osm4nd\nhttps://twitter.com/seb_lazar\nhttps://twitter.com/securielite\n\n**LinkedIn Profiles:**\n\nSecuriElite - https://www.linkedin.com/company/securielite/\nCarter Edwards, HR Director @ Trend Macro - https://www.linkedin.com/in/carteredwards-a99138204/\nColton Perry, Security Researcher - https://www.linkedin.com/in/colton-perry6a8059204/\nEvely Burton, Technical Recruiter @ Malwarebytes - https://www.linkedin.com/in/evelyburton-204b29207/\nOsman Demir, CEO @ SecuriElite - https://www.linkedin.com/in/osman-demir307520209/\nPiper Webster, Security Researcher - https://www.linkedin.com/in/piper-webster192676203/\nSebastian Lazarescue, Security Researcher @ SecuriElite https://www.linkedin.com/in/sebastian-lazarescue-456840209/\n\n**Email:**\n\ncontact@securielite.com\nosman@securielite.com\nsubmit@securielite.com\n\n**Attacker Owned Domains:**\n\n\n-----\n\nbestwing[.]org\ncodebiogblog[.]com\ncoldpacific[.]com\ncutesaucepuppy[.]com\ndevguardmap[.]org\nhireproplus[.]com\nhotelboard[.]org\nmediterraneanroom[.]org\nredeastbay[.]com\nregclassboard[.]com\nsecurielite[.]com\nspotchannel02[.]com\nwileprefgurad[.]net\n\nPOSTED IN:\n\n[Threat Analysis Group](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/%20)\n\n\n-----",
