Concerned about a cybersecurity\nthreat that would have the potential to destroy physical assets and human lives, many looked\n\n\n-----\n\nto sound the alarm in industrial organizations, tracking the vulnerabilities that could lead to a\ncompromise in operational technology networks.\n\nA variety of attacks in that realm took place over the years, whether launched in nation-state\n[conflicts across the globe or as an apparent amateur challenge. Most recently,](https://www.wired.com/story/russian-hackers-attack-ukraine/)\ncybercriminals who deploy ransomware targeted a large U.S. refined products pipeline\nsystem, causing disruption to its operations and making headlines across the world. The\nattack reportedly only affected IT networks but had the potential to spread to operational\nzones and upstream to the overall supply chain — an attack scenario that could be much\nmore damaging.\n\nUnlike many attacks on industrial organizations that have been connected to adversarial\nnation-states, it seems that the pipeline attack might be a cybercrime case motivated by a\nlarge bounty. The group suspected in this hit goes by the name “DarkSide.”\n\n[IBM Security X-Force data shows that ransomware has become the number one threat type](https://www.ibm.com/security/data-breach/threat-intelligence)\nX-Force responded to in 2020 accounting for 23% of actual attacks that impacted\norganizations. Of those, our incident response data shows 59% of attacks were doubleextortion cases, where in addition to having their data encrypted, victims were also\nthreatened with data being leaked unless they paid for a decryption key by a specified\ndeadline.\n\nX-Force incident response data further shows that ransomware attacks were the most\ncommon threat to organizations that use operational technology (OT) in 2020. Sectors we\nexamined in our data include manufacturing, oil and gas, transportation, utilities,\nconstruction, and mining, where ransomware attacks accounted for 33% of all attacks we\nresponded to. This trend suggests that threat actors may be finding organizations with OT\nnetworks to be particularly attractive for ransomware attacks precisely because of the costly\ndowntime and impact on a wider ecosystem and on individual consumers.\n\n## Who is on the DarkSide?\n\nIn August 2020, a new ransomware gang announced its entry into the cybercrime arena. In\nno less than a “press release” of sorts, its operators declared they had developed the perfect\nransomware tool because other codes they used in the past were not up to the task. The\npost appeared on the group’s [TOR domain where the newcomers also advised they were not](https://www.torproject.org/)\ninexperienced cybercriminals and acted as former affiliates to other successful gangs,\nmaking millions of dollars in the process. The malware itself has small similarities to the\n[GandCrab and Sodinokibi ransomware, as does the ransom note’s template. Another](https://securityintelligence.com/posts/sodinokibi-revil-ransomware-disrupt-trade-secrets/)\nsimilarity is that DarkSide is designed to avoid computers where a language layout\ncorresponds with one of 17 countries from the former Soviet Union, adding Syrian Arabic —\nanother similarity to Sodinokibi. When looking for affiliates to join their ranks, tech-savvy\nRussian speakers need apply. They further stress that they are not interested in “English\n\n\n-----\n\nspeaking personalities.  DarkSide has also noted that while they plan to target\norganizations, they would aim for those who ‘can pay’ and spare healthcare, schools, nonprofits, and government.\n\n## New Group, Old TTPs\n\n[Like other gangs that operate modern ransomware codes, such as Sodinokibi and Maze,](https://securityintelligence.com/posts/sodinokibi-revil-ransomware-disrupt-trade-secrets/)\nDarkSide blends crypto-locking data with data exfiltration and extortion. If they are not initially\npaid for a decryption key, the attackers threaten to publish confidential data they stole from\nthe victim and post it on their dedicated website, DarkSide Leaks, for at least 6 months.\nWhen a ransom note appears on an encrypted networked device, the note also\ncommunicates a TOR URL to a page called “Your personal leak page” as part of the threat\nthat if the ransom is not paid, data will be uploaded to that URL. Ransom is demanded in\nBitcoin or Monero. If it is not paid by a specific initial deadline, the amount doubles.\n\n_Figure 1: A “Welcome to the Dark” ransom note_\n\nA favorite entry point appears to be connecting via RDP on port 443 typically routing via a\n[TOR browser. This is concurrent with a trend X-Force has been observing in similar attacks](https://securityintelligence.com/posts/multifactor-authentication-changing-threat-landscape/)\non organizational networks where attackers opt to scan and exploit targets rather than using\ncompromised credentials.\n\nMimikatz and Cobalt Strike are part of the DarkSide attackers’ arsenal. Used in postexploitation, Cobalt Strike stagers help attackers control infected devices. ‘Stagers’ are tiny\nprograms that download the larger Beacon payload and pass control to it.\n\nDifferent parts of the attack are manually performed by an attacker, typically using familiar\nyet extensive living-off-the-land tactics. In cases of weakly secured or unmonitored servers,\nattackers were able to easily expand their ability to collect data and move laterally. Using\n[Windows Active Directory tools, some cases lead to a DCSync attack that can end in the](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/006/)\n[exposure of all AD data to the attacker and subsequent Golden Ticket attacks](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1558/001/)\n\n\n-----\n\nIn various DarkSide attacks, systems, where an EDR solution was installed were avoided.\n\n## Need for Speed — DarkSide v2.0\n\nMost ransomware operators understand that they need speed to encrypt as much data as\npossible as quickly as they can. They, therefore, opt to use symmetric encryption for that first\nphase and then encrypt the first key with an asymmetric key. In DarkSide’s case, they claim\nto have come up with an accelerated implementation; the malware uses the Salsa20 stream\ncipher to encrypt victim data. They include an 80-byte public RSA-1024 key embedded in the\nmalware’s executable file and use it to encrypt the Salsa20 matrix. If implemented correctly, it\nis not possible to break this key and victims will have to find other ways to get their data back\nto an operational state.\n\nInterestingly, to assure victimized organizations that they can make good on their decryption\n[promises, DarkSide advertised their ability to provide the “fastest ever decryption speed.”](https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/darkside-20-ransomware-fastest/)\n\nThe malware can attack both Windows and Linux environments, making enterprise servers\njust as ‘encryptable’ as an employee’s endpoint. DarkSide can also attack virtual machines\nand encrypt data on their hard drives.\n\nWhere DarkSide attackers do take their time is the first stage of the attack. They do not\ninitiate the encryption process until they have attained other objectives that can help them\nmaximize eventual leverage on the victim, such as mapping networks and backups, setting\nup user access they can work with, and exfiltrating data they plan to leak later if they are not\npaid.\n\n## A Self-Confessed Financially Motivated Attack\n\nThe past decade saw ransomware evolve from a nuisance into one of the most impending\nrisks CISOs and security leaders must reckon with, no matter the sector they operate within.\nThe urgent need for incident response plans and capabilities has increased exponentially\nand has proven to be essential to mitigating risk, impact, and long-term results of cyberattacks.\n\n[Disruption, extortion, and sometimes destruction are the hallmarks of cyber attackers out to](https://securityintelligence.com/posts/from-state-sponsored-attackers-to-common-cybercriminals-destructive-attacks-on-the-rise/)\ndemand a ransom, as the phenomenon grows over time. Ransomware attacks have been\n[denounced and warned against by industry leaders and government officials alike. While](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-049a)\naddressing the U.S. Congress, former CISA director Chris Krebs noted that with raging\nransomware attacks “we are on the cusp of a global digital pandemic driven by greed.”\n\n[The group, when asked about their motivations, responded on social media that their aims](https://twitter.com/darktracer_int/status/1391735232991092738)\nwere financial.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe are apolitical, we do not participate in geopolitics, do not need to tie us with a\ndefined government and look for other our motives.\n\nOur goal is to make money, and not creating problems for society.\n\nFrom today we introduce moderation and check each company that our partners want\nto encrypt to avoid social consequences in the future.”\n\n_Figure 2: Source: DarkTrace_\n\nThe growing number of ransomware incidents around the globe has made this a critical issue\nfor national governments. As this attack continues to unfold, experts say fuel prices in the\nU.S. are likely to rise 2-3% starting May 10th, but the impact will continue to increase for as\nlong as the pipeline is offline. A government-issued emergency waiver allows for the\ntemporary delivery of fuel products via ground transportation until the pipeline’s operations\nare restored.\n\n## Adopting a Zero Trust Approach to Reduce Risk\n\nZero trust is a framework that assumes a complex network’s security is always at risk to\nexternal and internal threats. It helps organize and strategize a thorough approach to counter\nthose threats.\n\nBy assuming that every connection and endpoint is considered a threat, a zero trust\napproach leans on a framework that protects against these threats, whether external or\ninternal, even for those connections already inside. In a nutshell, a zero-trust network:\n\n\n-----\n\nLogs and inspects all corporate network traffic\nLimits and controls access to the network\nVerifies and secures network resources\n\nTo expand, the zero-trust security model is designed so that data and resources are\ninaccessible by default. Users can only access them on a limited basis under the right\ncircumstances, known as least-privilege access. A zero-trust security model verifies and\nauthorizes every connection, such as when a user connects to an application or software, to\na data set via an application programming interface (API). It requires that the interaction\nmeets the conditional requirements of the organization’s security policies. A zero-trust\nsecurity strategy also authenticates and authorizes every device, network flow, and\nconnection based on dynamic policies, using context from as many data sources as\npossible. Learn more about IBM Security’s [zero trust approach.](https://www.ibm.com/security/zero-trust)\n\nX-Force is advising organizations to be on alert for growing ransomware attacks and to be\nprepared with offline backups while implementing network segmentation and applying critical\npatches to reduce the risk. Companies also need to test detection capabilities with adversary\nsimulation and red teaming, as well as rehearse and test incident response plans to identify\ngaps, so they can limit the spread of an attack if and when one happens.
