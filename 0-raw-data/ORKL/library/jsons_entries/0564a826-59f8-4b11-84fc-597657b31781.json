In recent attacks they set up a fake VPN Web Portal and targeted at\n\nleast �ve Israeli IT vendors, several �nancial institutes, and the Israeli Post Of�ce.\n\nLater, the attackers set up two fake websites pretending to be a University of Oxford conference sign-up\n\npage and a job application website. In these websites they hosted malware that was digitally\n\nsigned with a valid, likely stolen code signing certi�cate\n\nBased on VirusTotal uploads, malicious documents content, and known victims – other targeted\n\norganisations are located in Turkey, Qatar, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Lebanon.\n\n## Fake VPN Web Portal\n\nIn one of the recent cases, the attackers sent the following email to individuals in targeted\n\norganisations:\n\nThe email was sent from a compromised account of an IT vendor. Similar emails were sent from other\n\nIT vendors in the same time period, suggesting the attackers had a foothold within their networks, or at\n\nleast could get access to speci�c computers or email accounts.\n\nThe link provided in the malicious email led to a fake VPN Web Portal:\n\nUpon logging in with the credentials provided in the email, the victim is presented with the following\n\n\nIranian Threat Agent OilRig Delivers Digitally\n\n[Signed Malware, Impersonates University of](http://www.clearskysec.com/oilrig/)\n\nOxford\n\nAttacks Against Customer Service Centers by\n\nImpersonation of Potential Clients\n\nBusiness Email Compromise fraud Against Global\n\nShipping Companies\n\nMagecart – a malicious infrastructure for stealing\n\npayment details from online shops\n\n[Operation DustySky - Part 2](http://www.clearskysec.com/dustysky2/)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe victim is asked to install the “VPN Client” (an .exe �le), or, if download fails, to download a password\n\nprotected zip (with the same .exe �le inside).\n\n[The “VPN Client” is a legitimate Juniper VPN software bundled with Helminth, a malware in use by the](http://telussecuritylabs.com/threats/show/TSL20160530-07)\n\nOilRig threat agnet:\n\nJuniperSetupClientInstaller.exe\n\n[6a65d762fb548d2dc56cfde4842a4d3c (VirusTotal link)](https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/a367ccb9ca5a958d012e94ae8122feda9a1a7f23a0c84e2bc5ee35c834900b61/analysis/1483354486/)\n\nIf the victim downloads and installs the �le, their computer would get infected, while the legitimate VPN\n\nsoftware is installed. The legitimate and the malicious installations can be seen in the process tree\n\nwhen the �le is run in a Cuckoo sandbox. Malicious processes are marked red (click image to enlarge):\n\nThe following malicious �les are dropped and run:\n\nC:\\ProgramData\\{2ED05C38-D464-4188-BC7F\nF6915DE8D764}\\OFFLINE\\9A189DFE\\C7B7C186\\main.vbs\n\ndcac79d7dc4365c6d742a49244e81fd0\n\nC:\\Users\\Public\\Libraries\\RecordedTV\\DnE.ps1\n\n7fe0cb5edc11861bc4313a6b04aeedb2\n\nC:\\Users\\Public\\Libraries\\RecordedTV\\DnS.ps1\n\n3920c11797ed7d489ca2a40201c66dd4\n\n“C:\\Windows\\System32\\schtasks.exe” /create /F /sc minute /mo 3 /tn\n\n“GoogleUpdateTasksMachineUI” /tr C:\\Users\\Public\\Libraries\\RecordedTV\\backup.vbs\n\n7528c387f853d96420cf7e20f2ad1d32\n\nCommand and control server is located in the following domain:\n\ntecsupport[.]in\n\nA detailed analysis of the malware is provided in [two](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/05/the-oilrig-campaign-attacks-on-saudi-arabian-organizations-deliver-helminth-backdoor/) [posts by Palo Alto networks and in a](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/10/unit42-oilrig-malware-campaign-updates-toolset-and-expands-targets/) [post by](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2016/05/targeted_attacksaga.html)\n\nFireEye, which wrote about previous campaigns by this threat agent.\n\n(Note that Juniper networks was not compromised nor otherwise involved in the attack, except for the\n\nattackers using its name and publicly available software).\n\n## Digitally signed malware\n\nThe entire bundle (VPN client and malware) was digitally signed with a valid code signing certi�cate\n\nissued by Symantec to AI Squared, a legitimate software company that develops accessibility software:\n\n\n-----\n\nThumbprint: 92B8C0872BACDC226B9CE4D783D5CCAD61C6158A\n\nSerial number:62 E0 44 E7 37 24 61 2D 79 4B 93 AF 97 46 13 48\n\nThis suggest that the attackers had got a hold of an AI Squared signing key, potentially after\n\ncompromising their network. Alternatively, the attackers might have got Symantec to issue them a\n\ncerti�cate under AI Squared’s name.\n\n## University of Oxford impersonation\n\nThe attackers registered four domains impersonating The University of Oxford.\n\n**oxford-symposia[.]com, is a fake Oxford conference registration website. Visitors are asked to**\n\ndownload the “University Of Oxford Job Symposium Pre-Register Tool”:\n\nThe downloaded �le (which is also signed with an AI Squared certi�cate), is a fake registration tool built\n\nby the attackers:\n\nOxfordSymposiumRegTool.exe\n\nf77ee804de304f7c3ea6b87824684b33\n\nIf run by the victim, their computer would get infected, while they are shown this registration process:\n\n\n-----\n\nNote that after completing the “registration process”, the victim is asked to send the form to an email\n\naddress in oxford-careers[.]com, which also belongs to the attackers.\n\nPreviously the fake website linked to the following documents in a third fake Oxford domain, oxford[.]in:\n\nhttp://oxford[.]in/downloads/ls1.doc\n\nhttp://oxford[.]in/downloads/ls2.doc\n\nhttp://oxford[.]in/downloads/ls3.doc\n\nhttp://oxford[.]in/downloads/ls4.do\n\nThe documents were unavailable during our research, and their content is unknown to us.\n\nThe attackers used a forth domain, oxford-employee[.]com, to host an “Oxford Job application” website:\n\ni i k d “ l d C C ” i d “ i i i f O f d ff” C C i\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen run, the victim is again presented with a tool created by the attackers, this time a “University Of\n\nOxford Of�cial CV Creator”:\n\nBoth samples mentioned in this section had the following domain used for command and control:\n\nupdater[.]li\n\n## Other incidents\n\nIn an earlier incident, the attackers sent a malicious excel �le impersonating Israir, an Israeli Airline (the\n\ncontent of the �le was copied from the company’s public website and we have no indication of it\n\nbeing compromised or targeted):\n\nIsrael Airline.xls\n\n197c018922237828683783654d3c632a\n\nThe �le had a macro that if enabled by the user would infect its computer.\n\n**In other incidents the attackers used the following �les:**\n\nSpecial Offers.xls / Salary Employee 2016.xls\n\nf76443385fef159e6b73ad6bf7f086d6\n\npic.xls\n\n3a5fcba80c1fd685c4b5085d9d474118\n\n\n-----\n\ncv.xls\n\n72e046753f0496140b4aa389aee2e300\n\nusers.xls\n\n262bc259682cb48ce66a80dcc9a5d587\n\nEmployee Engagement Survey.xls\n\n726175e9aba421aa0f96cfc005664302\n\nJuniperSetupClientInstaller.exe\n\nf8ce7e356e09de6a48dca9e51421b6f6\n\nProject_Domain_No337.chm\n\n[1792cdd0c5397ff5df445d73276d1a50 (undetected as malicious by any antivirus on VirusTotal)](https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/8cb80ac1f955bac9ccf67e843ddc15322b4aa70e8c98269a8a98a02df4cbd8b7/analysis/)\n\ngcaa_report_series15561.chm\n\n[d50ab63f4034c6f5eb356e3326320e66 (undetected as malicious by any antivirus on VirusTotal)](https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/172b407b28dff5b2f1110545758f15185668c305b0b371c02c8870770f4f7e7a/analysis/)\n\n## Infrastructure overlap with Cadelle and Chafer\n\n[In December 2015, Symantec published a post about “two Iran-based attack groups that appear to be](https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/iran-based-attackers-use-back-door-threats-spy-middle-eastern-targets)\n\nconnected, Cadelle and Chafer” that “have been using Backdoor.Cadelspy and Backdoor.Remexi to spy\n\non Iranian individuals and Middle Eastern organizations”.\n\nBackdoor.Remexi, one of the malware in use by Chafer, had the following command and control host:\n\n87pqxz159.dockerjsbin[.]com\n\nInterestingly, IP address 83.142.230.138, which serve as a command and control address for an OilRig\n\nrelated sample (3a5fcba80c1fd685c4b5085d9d474118), was pointed to\n\nby 87pqxz159.dockerjsbin[.]com as well.\n\nThis suggest that the two groups may actually be the same entity, or that they share resources in one\n\nwhy or another.\n\n## Indicators of compromise\n\n[Indicators �le: oilrig-indicators.csv (also available on PassiveTotal)](http://www.clearskysec.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/oilrig-indicators.csv)\n\nThe graph below depicts the OilRig infrastructure (click to enlarge):\n\n### Acknowledgments\n\n[This research was facilitated by PassiveTotal for threat infrastructure analysis, and by MalNet for](https://www.passivetotal.org/)\n\n[malware research .
