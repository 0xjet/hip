Spicy Hot Pot is a browser hijacking rootkit that changes a user’s homepage to point to a page controlled by the malware operator, in addition to uploading memory dumps from a machine to a predefined server and incorporating a local update feature to ensure it can remain updated. Usually a browser hijacker would do this through malicious executables or registry keys that change the user’s homepage; however, Spicy Hot Pot takes this one step further by using two kernel-mode drivers that are dropped to disk and installed during the infection process to remain stealthy.\n\n These kernel drivers have a number of functions, such as hindering security software by intercepting their callback functions, collecting any memory dumps created on the system from a specific directory, and giving the malware operator the ability to update the malware as they see fit. In addition, one of the kernel drivers acts as a minifilter, which gives it the ability to intercept and modify any user input or output requests. One of the functions of this driver is to intercept any attempts by a user to display the malicious files, effectively making them invisible.\n\n This particular piece of malware is primarily focused on Chinese users. This is inferred based on 1) it was found dropped from a number of keygen/activation tools used to “crack” or illegitimately activate Microsoft products that are developed with Chinese language packs, and 2) this malware is specifically targeting\n\n\n-----\n\n### common antivirus software used in China. Although more can be said about this piece of malware, this blog post aims to give a quick overview of Spicy Hot Pot, its capabilities and how it can be manually removed from a host without the need for third-party software.\n\n## The Initial Detection\n\n### In June 2020, the CrowdStrike Falcon Complete™ team received a machine learning (ML) alert that a suspicious binary called “baofeng15.0” attempted to run in a customer’s environment. This had the below SHA256 hash:\n```\n    498ed725195b5ee52e406de237afa9ef268cabc4ef604c363aee2e78b3b13193\n\n After analyzing this binary, the determination was made that it is bundled with a browser hijacking rootkit. This rootkit is known to date back as early as December 2019 and remains prevalent with new variants being discovered to date.\n\n Starting with dynamic analysis of the binary in question, it was revealed that it dropped nine items of interest (seven executables and two filter drivers) before disabling hibernation mode on the machine. A recreation of this activity after disabling preventions can be seen below using CrowdStrike Falcon’s process execution tree.\n\n```\nFigure 1. Spicy Hot Pot as seen in the CrowdStrike Falcon process execution tree (click image to enlarge)\n\n### This detection raises a number of questions due to the context and location of dropped binaries when run on a Windows 10 machine.\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n%localappdata%\\Microsoft\\Event Viewer\\wccenter.exe\n\n```\n\n### On Windows 7, the drivers fall into “Media Player” instead of “WindowsApps.” In addition, this made a number of registry modifications to the local machine’s software hive:\n```\n   Software\\Microsoft\\Helicarrier\\st\\stemp\n   Software\\Microsoft\\Helicarrier\\Channel\n   Software\\Microsoft\\DirectX\\DvVersion\n   Software\\Microsoft\\DirectX\\PvVersion\n   Software\\Microsoft\\DirectX\\RvVersion\n   Software\\Microsoft\\Helicarrier\\dp\n   Software\\Microsoft\\Helicarrier\\ca\n   Software\\Microsoft\\Helicarrier\\dr\n   Software\\Microsoft\\Helicarrier\\eu\n   Software\\Microsoft\\Helicarrier\\fd\n   Software\\Microsoft\\Helicarrier\\ap\n\n One important item to note is the presence of a new baofeng15.0.exe binary with a different hash. This was far more widespread than the binary that was just run and had a creation timestamp dating back four years:\n\n```\n```\n2016-01-13 13:19:34\n\n```\n\n### Based on this, it’s likely that an older cracking tool has been repackaged with this malware and distributed online by the malware operator. The other eight files dropped are signed by a few different signing certificates issued to “Beijing JoinHope Image Technology Ltd.” Unique samples found have different validity timeframes for their signing certificates, showing validity issued anywhere from 1 minute to 10 years ago. At the time of writing, all had expired; however, they were still able to be successfully installed due to exceptions to driver signing enforcement.\n\n File Name Signing Certificate\n\n`DvLayout.exe` Valid From  12:00 AM 05/16/2014\n### Valid To    11:59 PM 05/16/2015\n\n`wccenter.exe` Valid From  12:00 AM 05/16/2014\n### Valid To    11:59 PM 05/16/2015\n\n`wrme.exe` Valid From  12:00 AM 02/08/2010\n### Valid To    11:59 PM 02/07/2020\n\n`wuhost.exe` Valid From  12:00 AM 02/08/2010\n### Valid To    11:59 PM 02/07/2020\n\n`wdlogin.exe` Valid From  04:23 AM 08/22/2020\n### Valid To    04:23 AM 08/22/2020\n\n\n-----\n\n`_J861.exe` Valid From  12:00 AM 02/08/2010\n### Valid To    11:59 PM 02/07/2020\n\n`baofeng15.0.exe` Not Signed\n\n`KMDF_LOOK.sys` Valid From  02:21 AM 06/13/2020\n### Valid To    02:21 AM 06/13/2020\n\n`KMDF_Protect.sys` Valid From  12:00 AM 05/16/2014\n### Valid To    11:59 PM 05/16/2015\n\n  Table 1. Validity timeframes for the files dropped by Spicy Hot Pot\n\n Comparing this signing certificate to a public repository of malware samples reveals hundreds of unique malware samples, indicating that the creator of this malware (or someone with access to these signing certificates) is in no rush to stop using certificates issued to this entity. Many pieces of malware signed by this entity contained similar debugging (pdb) locations in their debug strings.\n\n Binary PDB\n```\n KMDF_LOOK.sys G:\\SVN\\源码\\驱动\\LookFile\\KMDF_LOOK\\Release\\KMDF_LOOK_64.pdb\n KMDF_Protect.sys G:\\SVN\\源码\\驱动\\protect\\KMDF_Protect\\Release\\KMDF_Protect_64.pdb\n wdlogin.exe D:\\Work\\Install_Driver\\Driver_helper\\Release\\wdlogin.pdb\n wrme.exe D:\\Work\\Install_Driver\\Driver_helper\\Release\\wrme.pdb\n wccenter.exe D:\\Work\\Install_Driver\\Driver_helper\\Release\\wccenter.pdb\n _J861.exe E:\\work\\Icon_Report\\Release\\_service.pdb\n wuhost.exe D:\\Work\\Install_Driver\\Driver_helper\\Release\\wuhost.pdb\n\n Table 2. Debugging locations found in Spicy Hot Pot malware\n\n To a normal user, the kernel drivers dropped to disk are completely invisible. This is because not only are they renamed and installed on infection, but through their installation they begin to act as a rootkit — and one of the drivers hides the malware files from being shown on disk. This extends to making the executables dropped to disk invisible. We can see the different filtering capabilities of this driver from analyzing pseudo-code of the file\n\n```\n```\nKMDF_Protect.sys.\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2. Minifilter being registered\n\nFigure 3. Searching for .sys and `.exe files to filter on`\n\n### In addition to this, KMDF_Protect.sys checks for any executables running with known binary names from Qihoo 360 software.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4. Checking for antivirus software attempting to run\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5. Strings used in preventing antivirus software from loading scanning modules\n\n### This also adds a shutdown callback for persistence. At shutdown, the driver attempts to write back the location of wccenter.exe to the system’s “RunOnce” key so that it runs again on boot. As this is performed by the kernel-mode driver, this modification isn’t shown by common registry monitoring tools.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6. Persistence through a shutdown function callback\n\n### If we compare this to KMDF_LOOK.sys, we can see that its primary function is to hijack the user’s homepage and delete process callbacks to security software.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7. Hardcoded URLs for the browser hijacking component\n\n### It should be noted that both drivers masquerade as legitimate service names to remain stealthy:\n\n Driver Malicious Service Name Masqueraded Legitimate Service Name\n\n`KMDF_Protect.sys` iaLPSS1z iaLPSSi*: Intel Serial IO Driver\n\n`KMDF_LOOK.sys` LSI_SAS2l LSI_SAS2: LSI SAS GEN 2 Driver (StorPort)\n\n### Briefing over other components of this malware:\n```\n   DVLayout.exe is used to install the rootkit. This creates the Mutex “DVLayout.”\n   _J861.exe is used to gather system information of the infected client, including serial number,\n\n and has a number of networking functions that support the operation of this malware. This temporarily creates a service called “R.”\n   wccenter.exe communicates with KMDF_Protect.sys using a named device created called\n   \\\\Device\\\\iaLPSS1z and is used to run wdlogin.exe, wuhost.exe and wrme.exe .\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8. `wccenter.exe startup execution`\n```\nwuhost.exe is used to update the rootkit drivers and modules as required. It creates the Mutex “Update” and\n\n### contacts one of the following domains to fetch this update:\n\n https[:]//du[.]testjj[.]com https[:]//da[.]testiu[.]com https[:]//db[.]testyk[.]com\nwrme.exe is used to download and start or install modules such as wuhost.exe and wdlogin.exe in addition\n\n to gathering information about the operating system. It creates the Mutex “DLreport.”\nwdlogin.exe is used to find any dump file ending with dmp in the %SystemRoot%\\minidump directory,\n\n compress it, and upload it to one of the above servers at the endpoint /api/v1/post_dump. This is likely for troubleshooting any blue screen errors that may be caused by the rootkit. It creates the Mutex “dumping.”\n\n## Investigation with Endpoint Detection and Response Data\n\n### Using CrowdStrike Falcon’s telemetry via our Endpoint Activity Monitoring (EAM) application, we’re able to see the infection actions taking place when protections are disabled. This includes file writes of _J861.exe,\nKMDF_Protect.sys, KMDF_LOOK.sys, and their associated driver loads.\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nFigure 9. File events as seen in CrowdStrike Falcon’s EAM Application (click image to enlarge)\n\nFigure 10. DriverLoad events as seen in the CrowdStrike Falcon EAM application (click image to enlarge)\n\n### By checking the registry and filter drivers on this host through CrowdStrike Falcon’s Real Time Response (RTR) capability, we can locate the kernel drivers running and the dropped binaries to prove they reside on disk, given that we know their name and location. This works even though Spicy Hot Pot filters user input and output requests to make the files invisible to a normal user of Windows.\n\nFigure 11. Rootkit drivers as seen through Real Time Response (RTR)\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 12. Rootkit service as seen through Real Time Response (RTR)\n\n### Figure 13. Rootkit service as seen through Real Time Response (RTR)\n\n## The Remediation\n\n### Spicy Hot Pot, like many other rootkits, utilizes kernel filter drivers that once started cannot be stopped by a user. These filter drivers prevent removal of registry keys, services or the kernel drivers themselves that are associated with the infection. Due to this, removing Spicy Hot Pot malware remotely can be quite challenging. Remediating a rootkit often requires doing so from a machine that is powered off or booted into safe mode; however, we can remove a rootkit such as Spicy Hot Pot without going to these extremes by making sure it cannot run at startup.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Spicy Hot Pot places the malicious filter drivers within the WindowsApps folder, which, in addition to the “Event Viewer” or “Media Player” folder, is what is being filtered on. If you rename the folder, the filter drivers immediately become visible.\n\nFigure 14. Rootkit drivers visible after renaming WindowsApps folder\n\n### This can be done even when the kernel filters are running, but the filter drivers cannot be removed by a user as they’re still running and protected.\n\nFigure 15. Protected in-use kernel drivers that cannot be removed\n\n### After renaming the folder, if you restart an infected system, the path that is referenced by the kernel filter driver services no longer exists, and the drivers will fail to load. At this point, the drivers and associated malicious executables can be removed, and the folder renamed to “WindowsApps” once more. The services and registry keys associated with the rootkit can also be removed now.\n\nFigure 16. Rootkit driver removal as seen through Real Time Response (RTR)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusion\n\n### This post touched on a common browser hijacker being distributed with tools designed to illegitimately activate Microsoft products. It highlights some of the concerns associated with running “cracking” tools on a machine, and why it’s important to monitor and prevent not only unknown executables that are running, but also drivers that are loaded by an operating system and any minifilters present.\n\n By fusing CrowdStrike Falcon’s detection and prevention capabilities, enriched endpoint telemetry, Real Time Response capability and the expertise of the CrowdStrike Falcon Complete team, you’re uniquely positioned with the capability to detect, investigate, understand and respond to unknown threats within your environment 24/7, 365 days of the year.\n\n## Indicators\n\n### Type Name/Purpose Indicator\n\n SHA256 baofeng15.0 498ed725195b5ee52e406de237afa9ef268cabc4ef604c363aee2e78b3b13193\n\n SHA256 DvLayout.exe 551c4564d5ff537572fd356fe96df7c45bf62de9351fae5bb4e6f81dcbe34ae5\n\n SHA256 wccenter.exe 17095beda4afeabb7f41ff07cf866ddc42e49da1a4ed64b9c279072caab354f6\n\n SHA256 wrme.exe 7e489f1f72cac9f1c88bdc6be554c78b5a14197d63d1bae7e41de638e903af21\n\n SHA256 wuhost.exe eb54cd2d61507b9e98712de99834437224b1cef31a81544a47d93e470b8613fc\n\n SHA256 wdlogin.exe 7c0fdee3670cc53a22844d691307570a21ae3be3ce4b66e46bb6d9baad1774b8\n\n SHA256 _J861.exe c83e6b96ee3aa1a580157547eae88d112d2202d710218f2ed496f7fe3d861abc\n\n SHA256 baofeng15.0.exe c5802c7fbad5cdf257bcc0f71e8b1c8853e06da411133b5dc78bd6c891f27500\n\n SHA256 KMDF_LOOK.sys 39764e887fd0b461d86c1be96018a4c2a670b1de90d05f86ed0acb357a683318\n\n SHA256 KMDF_Protect.sys ab0418eb1863c8a2211d06c764f45884c9b7dbd6d1943137fc010b8f3b8d14ae\n\n Domain Update/C2 du[.]testjj[.]com\n\n Domain Update/C2 da[.]testiu[.]com\n\n Domain Update/C2 db[.]testyk[.]com\n\n Domain Hijacking Domain gndh333[.]top\n\n Mutex wrme.exe DLreport\n\n Mutex wdlogin dumping\n\n Mutex wuhost Update\n\n Mutex DVLayout DVLayout\n\n## MITRE ATT&CK Mapping®\n\n\n-----\n\n### Tactic Technique Sub-Technique ID\n\n Reconnaissance Search Open Websites/Domains Search Engines T1593.002\n\n\n### Resource Development\n\n Resource Development\n\n\n### Acquire Infrastructure Domains T1583.001\n\n Obtain Capabilities Digital Certificates T1588.004\n\n\n### Initial Access Supply Chain Compromise Compromise Software Supply Chain\n\n\n### T1195.002\n\n T1547.001\n\n\n### Persistence Boot or Logon Autostart Execution\n\n Persistence Create or Modify System Process\n\n\n### Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder\n\n\n### Windows Service T1543.003\n\n\n### Defense Evasion Rootkit – T1014\n\n Defense Evasion Impair Defenses Disable or Modify Tools T1562.001\n\n Defense Evasion Masquerading Invalid Code Signature T1036.001\n\n Defense Evasion Masquerading Masquerade Task or Service T1036.004\n\n\n### Defense Evasion Masquerading Match Legitimate Name or Location\n\n\n### T1036.005\n\n\n### Collection Automated Collection – T1119\n\n\n### Command and Control\n\n\n### Encrypted Channel Asymmetric Cryptography T1573.002\n\n\n### Exfiltration Automated Exfiltration – T1020\n\n Exfiltration Exfiltration Over C2 Channel – T1041\n\n Impact Defacement Internal Defacement T1491.001\n\n Impact Service Stop – T1489\n\n## Yara Rules\n\n### /*  YARA Rule Set  Author: jai-minton  Date: 2020-11-01  Identifier: SpicyHotPot  Reference: https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/author/jai-minton/  copyright = “(c) 2020 CrowdStrike Inc.” *//* Rule Set —————————————————————– */\n```\n rule SpicyHotPot_wdlogin {\n meta:\n description = \"SpicyHotPot -
