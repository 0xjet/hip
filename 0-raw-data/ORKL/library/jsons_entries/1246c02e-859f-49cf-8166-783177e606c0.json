    "plain_text": "# Deconstructing a Cybersecurity Event\n\n**dragos.com/blog/deconstructing-a-cybersecurity-event/**\n\nBlog Post\n\nBy Dragos, Inc.\n\n05.10.23\n\n\nMay 10, 2023\n\n\n-----\n\nOn May 8, 2023, a known cybercriminal group attempted and failed at an extortion scheme\nagainst Dragos. No Dragos systems were breached, including anything related to the\nDragos Platform.\n\nDragos has a culture of transparency and a commitment to providing educational material\nto the community. This is why it’s important to us to share what happened during a recent\nfailed extortion scheme against Dragos in which a cybercriminal group attempted to\ncompromise our information resources. We want to share this experience with the\ncommunity, describe how we prevented it from being much worse, and, hopefully, help destigmatize security events.\n\nThe criminal group gained access by compromising the personal email address of a new\nsales employee prior to their start date, and subsequently used their personal information to\nimpersonate the Dragos employee and accomplish initial steps in the employee onboarding\nprocess. The group accessed resources a new sales employee typically uses in SharePoint\nand the Dragos contract management system. In one instance, a report with IP (internet\nprotocol) addresses associated with a customer was accessed, and we’ve reached out to\nthe customer.\n\nWe investigated alerts in our corporate Security Information & Event Management (SIEM)\nand blocked the compromised account. We promptly activated our incident response\nretainer with Crowdstrike and engaged our third-party Monitoring, Detection & Response\n(MDR) provider to manage incident response efforts. We are confident that our layered\nsecurity controls prevented the threat actor from accomplishing what we believe to be their\nprimary objective of launching ransomware. They were also prevented from accomplishing\nlateral movement, escalating privileges, establishing persistent access, or making any\nchanges to the infrastructure.\n\n## Timeline\n\n\n-----\n\nA known TTP of this criminal group is to deploy ransomware. After they failed to gain\ncontrol of a Dragos system and deploy ransomware, they pivoted to attempting to extort\nDragos to avoid public disclosure. Below are samples of various messages sent to Dragos\nexecutives.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe next activity was to expand tactics to include references to family members and\ncontacts.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe cybercriminal continued to escalate their messages, Dragos did not engage.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe cybercriminal continued reaching out to multiple publicly known Dragos contacts to\nelicit a response.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe cybercriminal’s texts demonstrated research into family details as they knew names of\nfamily members of Dragos executives, which is a known TTP. However, they referenced\nfictitious email addresses for these family members. In addition, during this time, the\ncybercriminal contacted senior Dragos employees via personal email.\n\nOur decision was that the best response was to not engage with the criminals.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile the external incident response firm and Dragos analysts feel the event is contained,\nthis is an ongoing investigation. The data that was lost and likely to be made public because\nwe chose not to pay the extortion is regrettable. However, it is our hope that highlighting the\nmethods of the adversary will help others consider additional defenses against these\napproaches so that they do not become a victim to similar efforts.\n\n## MITRE ATT&CK Mapping\n\n**Tactic** **Technique** **Procedure**\n\nTA0001 T1078 Leverage Valid Accounts\n\nTA0006 T1621 Multi-Factor Authentication Request Generation\n\nTA0007 T1526 Cloud Service Discovery\n\nTA0009 T1530 Collect Data from Cloud Storage\n\nTA00010 T1567 Exfiltration Over Web Service\n\nTA0042 T1586.002 Compromise Email Accounts\n\nTA0043 T1593 Search Open Websites/Domains\n\nT1591.004 Gather Victim Org Information: Identify Roles\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\nIP Addresses\n```\n144[.]202[.]42[.]216\n162[.]33[.]179[.]126\n\n```\nEmail Address\n```\ndragos.negotiations[@]proton.me\n\n## Lessons Learned\n\n```\nIn response to this event, we added an additional verification step to further harden our\nonboarding process and ensure that this technique cannot be repeated.\n\nEvery thwarted access attempt was due to multi-step access approval. We are evaluating\nexpanding the use of this additional control based on system criticality.\n\nPositive outcomes further reinforce our resolve to not engage or negotiate with\ncybercriminals.\n\n\n-----\n\nVerbose system activity logs enabled the rapid triage and containment of this security\nevent.\n\n## Recommendations\n\nHarden Identity & Access Management infrastructure and processes\nImplement separation of duties across the enterprise\nApply the principle of least privilege to all systems and services\nImplement multi-factor authentication everywhere feasible\nApply explicit blocks for known bad IP addresses (like those shown above)\nScrutinize incoming emails for typical phishing triggers, including the email address,\nURL, and spelling\nEnsure continuous security monitoring is in place, with tested incident response\nplaybooks\n\nAgain, our investigation is ongoing, and we will reach out directly if we learn of additional\neffects on our customers. In the meantime, if you have questions, please send them to\nDragos’s Office of the CISO at [ciso-office@dragos.com.](mailto:ciso-office@dragos.com)\n\n\n-----",
