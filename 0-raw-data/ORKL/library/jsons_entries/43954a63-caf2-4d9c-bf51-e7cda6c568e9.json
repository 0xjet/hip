That’s our shorthand for the use of](https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/attackers-are-increasingly-living-land)\noperating system features or legitimate network administration tools to compromise victims’\nnetworks. The purpose of living off the land is twofold. By using such features and tools,\nattackers are hoping to blend in on the victim’s network and hide their activity in a sea of\nlegitimate processes. Secondly, even if malicious activity involving these tools is detected, it\ncan make it harder to attribute attacks. If everyone is using similar tools, it’s more difficult to\ndistinguish one group from another. Most attack groups do still create and leverage custom\nmalware, but it tends to be employed sparingly, reducing the risk of discovery.\n\n## Finding the needle in the haystack\n\nThis doesn’t mean espionage attacks are now going undiscovered, but it does mean that\nthey can take longer for analysts to investigate. This is one of the reasons why Symantec\n[created Targeted Attack Analytics (TAA), which takes tools and capabilities that we’ve](https://resource.elq.symantec.com/LP=5847?cid=70138000001MFtXAAW)\ndeveloped for our own analysts and makes them available to our Advanced Threat\nProtection (ATP) customers. TAA leverages advanced artificial intelligence and machine\nlearning that combs through Symantec’s data lake of telemetry in order to spot patterns\nassociated with targeted attacks. Its advanced AI automates what previously would have\ntaken thousands of hours of analyst time. This makes it far easier for us, and for our\ncustomers, to find that “needle in the haystack.”\n\nIt was TAA that led us to the latest cyber espionage campaign we’ve uncovered. Back in\nJanuary 2018, TAA triggered an alert at a large telecoms operator in Southeast Asia. An\nattacker was using PsExec to move laterally between computers on the company’s network.\nPsExec is a Microsoft Sysinternals tool for executing processes on other systems and is one\nof the most frequently seen legitimate pieces of software used by attackers attempting to live\noff the land. However, it’s also widely used for legitimate purposes, meaning malicious use of\nPsExec can be difficult to spot.\n\nTAA not only flagged this malicious use of PsExec, it also told us what the attackers were\nusing it for. They were attempting to remotely install a previously unknown piece of malware\n[(Infostealer.Catchamas) on computers within the victim’s network.](https://www.symantec.com/security-center/writeup/2018-040209-1742-99)\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. Targeted Attack Analytics leverages machine learning to spot malicious activity\nassociated with targeted attacks and alerts the customer.\nArmed with this information about the malware and living off the land tactics being used by\nthis group of attackers whom we named Thrip, we broadened our search to see if we could\nfind similar patterns that indicated Thrip had been targeting other organizations. We\nuncovered a wide-ranging cyber espionage campaign involving powerful malware being\nused against targets that are a cause for concern.\n\nWe identified three computers in China being used to launch the Thrip attacks. Thrip’s motive\nis likely espionage and its targets include those in the communications, geospatial imaging,\nand defense sectors, both in the United States and Southeast Asia.\n\n## Eye on the sky: Thrip’s targets\n\nPerhaps the most worrying discovery we made was that Thrip had targeted a satellite\ncommunications operator. The attack group seemed to be particularly interested in the\noperational side of the company, looking for and infecting computers running software that\nmonitors and controls satellites. This suggests to us that Thrip’s motives go beyond spying\nand may also include disruption.\n\nAnother target was an organization involved in geospatial imaging and mapping. Again, Thrip\nseemed to be mainly interested in the operational side of the company. It targeted computers\nrunning MapXtreme Geographic Information System (GIS) software which is used for tasks\nsuch as developing custom geospatial applications or integrating location-based data into\nother applications. It also targeted machines running Google Earth Server and Garmin\nimaging software.\n\nThe satellite operator wasn’t the only communications target Thrip was interested in. The\ngroup had also targeted three different telecoms operators, all based in Southeast Asia. In all\ncases, based on the nature of the computers infected by Thrip, it appeared that the telecoms\ncompanies themselves and not their customers were the targets of these attacks.\n\nIn addition, there was a fourth target of interest, a defense contractor.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2. Thrip, spying on communications, mapping, and defense targets\n\n## Attempting to hide in plain sight\n\nThrip uses a mixture of custom malware and living off the land tools to perform its attacks.\nThe latter include:\n\n\n-----\n\n**PsExec: Microsoft Sysinternals tool for executing processes on other systems. The**\ntool was primarily used by the attackers to move laterally on the victim’s network.\n**PowerShell: Microsoft scripting tool that was used to run commands to download**\npayloads, traverse compromised networks, and carry out reconnaissance.\n**Mimikatz: Freely available tool capable of changing privileges, exporting security**\ncertificates, and recovering Windows passwords in plaintext.\n**WinSCP: Open source FTP client used to exfiltrate data from targeted organizations.**\n**LogMeIn: Cloud-based remote access software. It’s unclear whether the attackers**\ngained unauthorized access to the victim’s LogMeIn accounts or whether they created\ntheir own.\n\nAll of these tools, with the exception of Mimikatz (which is almost always used maliciously),\nhave legitimate uses. For example, PowerShell is widely used within enterprises and the vast\nmajority of scripts are legitimate. Similarly, PsExec is frequently used by systems\nadministrators. However, in this case, it was Thrip’s use of PsExec that drew our attention.\nThrough advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning, TAA has trained itself to spot\npatterns of malicious activity. While PsExec itself may be innocuous, the way that it was\nbeing used here triggered an alert by TAA. In short, Thrip’s attempts at camouflage blew its\ncover.\n\nWhile Thrip now makes heavy use of living off the land tactics, it also employs custom\n[malware (Infostealer.Catchamas), particularly against computers of interest. Catchamas is a](https://www.symantec.com/security-center/writeup/2018-040209-1742-99)\ncustom Trojan designed to steal information from an infected computer and contains\nadditional features designed to avoid detection.\n\n## Highly targeted espionage operation\n\nFrom the initial alert triggered by TAA, we were able to follow a trail that eventually enabled\nus to see the bigger picture of a cyber espionage campaign originating from computers\nwithin China and targeting multiple organizations in the U.S. and Southeast Asia. Espionage\nis the group’s likely motive but given its interest in compromising operational systems, it\ncould also adopt a more aggressive, disruptive stance should it choose to do so.\n\n## Protection\n\nThe following protections are in place to protect customers against Thrip attacks:\n\n**File-based protection**\n\n[Infostealer.Catchamas](https://www.symantec.com/security-center/writeup/2018-040209-1742-99)\n[Hacktool.Mimikatz](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2012-042615-3731-99)\n\n**Network protection products**\n\n\n-----\n\nMalware Analysis Appliance detects activity associated with Thrip\nCustomers with Webpulse-enabled products are protected against activity associated\nwith Thrip\n\n**Threat intelligence**\nIn addition to file-based protection, customers of the DeepSight Intelligence Managed\nAdversary and Threat Intelligence (MATI) service have received reports on Thrip, which\ndetail methods of detecting and thwarting activities of this group.\n\n## File Attachments\n\n[Thrip IOC listTXT564 bytes](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/sites/default/files/2018-06/Thrip_IOCs.txt)\n\n## Further reading\n\nTo find out more about Targeted Attack Analytics (TAA), read our whitepaper Targeted Attack\n[Analytics: Using Cloud-based Artificial Intelligence for Enterprise-Focused Advanced Threat](https://resource.elq.symantec.com/LP=5847?cid=70138000001MFtXAAW)\nProtection\n\n## About the Author\n\n### Threat Hunter Team\n\n**Symantec**\n\nThe Threat Hunter Team is a group of security experts within Symantec whose mission is to\ninvestigate targeted attacks, drive enhanced protection in Symantec products, and offer\nanalysis that helps customers respond to attacks.\n\n## Want to comment on this post?\n\n\n-----",
