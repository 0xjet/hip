In the face of massive disruption brought about by the COVIDdriven social, economic and technological shifts of 2020, adversaries\n\n##### Frefined their tradecraft to become even more sophisticated and brazen. The result\n\nwas a series of high-profile attacks that rocked many organizations and, on their\nown, represented watershed moments in cybersecurity.\n\nAs organizations scrambled at the start of 2021 to protect supply chains and\ninterconnected systems in the face of the incredibly sophisticated Sunburst attack,\nadversaries exploited zero-day vulnerabilities and architectural limitations in legacy\nsystems like Microsoft to leave many reeling. At the same time, eCrime syndicates\nrefined and amplified big game hunting (BGH) ransomware attacks that ripped\nacross industries, sowing devastation and sounding the alarm on the frailty of our\ncritical infrastructure.\n\nFor security teams already dealing with an ongoing skills shortage, these issues\nproved challenging enough on their own. But the strain on security teams was\namplified even more at the end of the year when the ubiquitous Log4Shell\nvulnerability threatened a complete security meltdown.\n\nUnderstanding these events gives visibility into the shifting dynamics of adversary\ntactics, which is critical for staying ahead of today’s threats. This is the context\nthat the CrowdStrike 2022 Global Threat Report delivers. Developed based on the\nfirsthand observations of our elite CrowdStrike Intelligence and Falcon OverWatch™\nteams, combined with insights drawn from the vast telemetry of the CrowdStrike\nSecurity Cloud, this year’s report provides crucial insights into what security teams\nneed to know about an increasingly ominous threat landscape.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Enterprise risk is coalescing around three critical areas:\n Endpoints\n and cloud workloads Identity Data\n\n\nAmong the details you’ll learn in this year’s report:\n\n**[How state-sponsored adversaries targeted IT and cloud service providers\n]**\n**to exploit trusted relationships and supply chain partners**\n\n**[How state-sponsored adversaries weaponized vulnerabilities to evade ]**\n**detection and gain access to critical applications and infrastructure**\n\n**[How sophisticated adversaries exploited stolen credentials and identities ]**\n**to amplify ransomware BGH attacks and infiltrate cloud environments**\n\n**[How malicious actors intensified attacks on critical cloud infrastructure ]**\n**with new, sophisticated approaches**\n\nOur annual report also paints a picture that shows enterprise risk is coalescing\naround three critical areas: endpoints and cloud workloads, identity and data. Threat\nactors continue to exploit vulnerabilities across endpoints and cloud environments,\nand ramp up innovation on how they use identities and stolen credentials to bypass\nlegacy defenses — all to reach their goal, which is your data. CrowdStrike has\nobserved that 62% of attacks comprise non-malware, hands-on-keyboard activity.\nAs adversaries advance their tradecraft in this manner to bypass legacy security\nsolutions, autonomous machine learning alone is not good enough to stop dedicated\nattackers.\n\nCrowdStrike is relentless in our drive to keep you ahead of adversaries today and\ninto the future. To meet the adversaries head-on, we’re unifying a modern approach\nto security with a platform that connects the machine both to the identity and the\ndata to deliver full Zero Trust protection. As adversaries shift to targeting cloud\nworkloads, we’re providing deep visibility and proactive security across the entire\ncloud-native stack. To alleviate the burden of the constant cycle of patching,\nwe’re prioritizing the vulnerabilities that create the most risk. And for the most\nsophisticated attacks, we’ve delivered powerful new extended detection and\nresponse (XDR) capabilities to help overwhelmed security teams automate response\nand reduce the time it takes to hunt across domains.\n\n2021 taught us that no matter how much adversity we face, the adversary will not\nrest. Attacks are growing more destructive, causing mass disruption in all aspects\nof our daily lives. But this is the challenge we’ve accepted and a fight that we will\n_win together. I hope you find this report informative and that it gives you the same_\nclarity of purpose it gives me: to be unrelenting in our drive to stop adversaries from\nstopping business and our way of life.\n\n**George Kurtz**\n\nCrowdStrike CEO and Co-Founder\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Table of Contents\n\n\n###### 5\n\n 7\n\n 8\n\n\n###### Introduction\n\n Naming Conventions\n\n Threat Landscape Overview\n\n 2021 Themes\n\n Ransomware and the Ever-adaptable Adversary\n\n Iran and the New Face of Disruptive Operations\n\n China Emerges as Leader in Vulnerability Exploitation\n\n Log4Shell Sets the Internet on Fire\n\n Increasing Threats to Cloud Environments\n\n\n###### 11 2021 Themes\n\n 11 Ransomware and the Ever-adaptable Adversary\n\n 14 Iran and the New Face of Disruptive Operations\n\n 16 China Emerges as Leader in Vulnerability Exploitation\n\n 19 Log4Shell Sets the Internet on Fire\n\n 22 Increasing Threats to Cloud Environments\n\n 26 Conclusion\n\n 27 Recommendations\n\n 29 About CrowdStrike\n\n 30 CrowdStrike Products and Services\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Introduction\n\n\n###### In 2021, targeted intrusion adversaries continued to adapt to the changing operational opportunities and strategic requirements of technology and world events.\n\n\ns we reflect upon 2021, two overarching themes come to the forefront:\nadaptability and perseverance. Businesses are finding paths forward\nwith new technologies and solutions, adapting in the face of adversity\nand persevering in spite of uncertainty as we continue to navigate the\nchallenges of living through a global pandemic. While these issues will ultimately A\nlead to strength and innovation in organizations around the world, they will also\ncreate new risks and vulnerabilities that can be exploited.\n\nCyber adversaries kept pace in 2021 with many adapting to a changing target\nlandscape. This trend was perhaps best exemplified by the shifts observed in\nthe 2021 eCrime ecosystem, which — while remaining vast and interconnected —\ncomprises many criminal enterprises that exist to support big game hunting (BGH)\nransomware operations. Notably, adversaries in 2021 were able to circumvent\nactions that threatened cessation of their operations, and some even resorted\nto rebranding as a result. Despite new approaches taken by law enforcement,\nincluding attempts to seize ransom payments and criminal funds before they\nreached adversaries’ hands, CrowdStrike Intelligence observed an 82% increase in\nransomware-related data leaks in 2021, compared to 2020. This increase, coupled\nwith other data leaks, is a stark reminder of the value that adversaries place on\nvictim data.\n\nIn 2021, targeted intrusion adversaries continued to adapt to the changing\noperational opportunities and strategic requirements of technology and world\nevents. Russian, Chinese, Iranian and North Korean adversaries were all observed\nemploying new tradecraft or target-scopes meant to respond to global trends.\nThis included: Russia’s targeting of IT and cloud service providers to exploit\ntrusted relationships; China’s weaponization of vulnerabilities at scale to facilitate\ninitial access efforts; Iran’s use of ransomware to blend disruptive operations with\nauthentic eCrime activity; and Democratic People's Republic of Korea’s (DPRK) shift\nto cryptocurrency-related entities in an effort to maintain illicit revenue generation\nduring economic disruptions caused by the pandemic.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 21\n Newly named aversaries\n\n 45%\n Increase in interactive intrusion campaigns\n\n 170+\n Total adversaries tracked\n\n 82%\n Increase in ransomware- related data leaks\n\n\nGovernments are also adapting. This year, CrowdStrike Intelligence debuted two\nnew adversary animals — WOLF and OCELOT — to label targeted intrusions\nemanating from Turkey and Colombia, respectively. The presence of these\nnew adversaries underscores the increase in offensive capabilities outside of\ngovernments traditionally associated with cyber operations, and highlights the\nvariety of actor end goals. Private sector offensive actors (PSOAs), such as NSO\n_Group and Candiru, continued to serve as hackers-for-hire throughout 2021,_\nproviding governments with substitute or supplemental capabilities and further\nenlarging the global actor space.\n\nIn the hacktivist landscape, CrowdStrike Intelligence observed the continued\ndevelopment of grassroots operations and a proliferation of established hacktivist\ngroups across the world. The rise of Belarusian group Cyber Partisans since\nlate 2020, the expanded role and diversification of the broader Iranian hacktivist\necosystem, and the growing participation of various hacktivists in response to\nWestern political developments all exemplify this trend.\n\nAs our adversaries adapt, so do we. CrowdStrike Intelligence offered an unparalleled\nlevel of coverage throughout 2021, adding 21 named adversaries and raising the\ntotal of tracked actors across all motivations to over 170. CrowdStrike Intelligence\ncontinues to expand coverage of threat landscapes beyond targeted intrusion,\neCrime and hacktivist mission areas; in 2021, we increased support for vulnerability\nintelligence and mobile intelligence across all our products.\n\nIn 2021, CrowdStrike launched Falcon Intelligence Recon+ as a companion\nservice for Falcon Intelligence Recon™. Falcon Intelligence Recon+ analysts\nmanage monitoring, triaging, assessing and mitigating threats across the criminal\nunderground. They also assess and recommend effective mitigation steps, helping\ncustomers act decisively and proactively to prevent and detect future attacks.\nCrowdStrike's Falcon Intelligence Elite service was also expanded in 2021 to\nprovide a single point of contact for onboarding, product integration, intelligence\nclarification, personalized threat briefing and intelligence research. Falcon\nIntelligence Elite analysts continue to provide proactive notifications of threats to\nCrowdStrike customer organizations.\n\nThe CrowdStrike 2022 Global Threat Report summarizes the entirety of analysis\nperformed by the CrowdStrike Intelligence team throughout 2021, including\ndescriptions of notable themes, trends and significant events in cybersecurity. This\nanalysis, combined with case studies from the Falcon OverWatch™ managed threat\nhunting team, demonstrates how threat intelligence and proactive hunting can\nprovide a deeper understanding of the motives, objectives and activities of these\nactors — information that can empower swift proactive countermeasures to better\ndefend your valuable data now and in the future.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Naming Conventions\n\nThis report follows the naming conventions instituted by CrowdStrike to categorize\nadversaries according to their nation-state affiliations or motivations. The following\nis a guide to these adversary naming conventions.\n\n|Adversary|Nation-state or Category|\n|---|---|\n|BEAR|RUSSIA|\n|BUFFALO|VIETNAM|\n|CHOLLIMA|DPRK (NORTH KOREA)|\n|CRANE|ROK (REPUBLIC OF KOREA)|\n|JACKAL|HACKTIVIST|\n|KITTEN|IRAN|\n|LEOPARD|PAKISTAN|\n|LYNX|GEORGIA|\n|OCELOT|COLOMBIA|\n|PANDA|PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA|\n|SPIDER|ECRIME|\n|TIGER|INDIA|\n|WOLF|TURKEY|\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Threat Landscape Overview\n\n eCrime Breakout Time\n\n1 hour 38 minutes\n\n**Today’s eCrime adversaries move with speed and**\n**purpose in pursuit of their objectives.**\n\nThe CrowdStrike Falcon OverWatch team measures\nbreakout time — the time an adversary takes to move\nlaterally from an initially compromised host to another host\nwithin the victim environment. Our analysis of the breakout\ntime for hands-on eCrime intrusion activity in 2021 — where\nsuch a metric could be derived — revealed an average of\njust 1 hour 38 minutes.\n\nThis number is essentially unchanged from what was\nreported by CrowdStrike’s Falcon OverWatch team in the\nCrowdStrike 2021 Threat Hunting Report, when breakout\ntime for eCrime actors was measured at 1 hour 32 minutes.\neCrime adversaries continue to show a high degree of\nsophistication as evidenced by the speed at which they can\nmove through a victim environment, leaving a very short\nwindow for defenders to respond.\n\n###### Adversary Tactics\n\n\nDetections indexed by the CrowdStrike Security Cloud in Q4 2021\n\n**Adversaries continue to show**\n**that they have moved beyond malware.**\n\nAttackers are increasingly attempting to accomplish\ntheir objectives without writing malware to the\nendpoint. Rather, they have been observed using\nlegitimate credentials and built-in tools — an\napproach known as “living off the land” (LOTL) — in\na deliberate effort to evade detection by legacy\nantivirus products. Of all detections indexed by the\nCrowdStrike Security Cloud in the fourth quarter of\n2021, 62% were malware-free.\n\n\nMalware-Free Malware\n\n###### 62% 38%\n\n\n-----\n\nIn 2021, OverWatch tracked steadily increasing numbers of interactive intrusion\ncampaigns. Compared to 2020, OverWatch observed a near 45% increase in the\nnumber of such campaigns, and uncovered more in the fourth quarter than in any\nother quarter.\n\n###### Interactive Intrusion Activity Over Time\n\neCrime Targeted Hacktivist Unattributed\n\nQ1 2020 Q2 2020 Q3 2020 Q4 2020 Q1 2021 Q2 2021 Q3 2021 Q4 2021\n\n**Figure 1. Quarterly Growth in Interactive Intrusion Campaigns by Threat Type, Q1 2020**\nto Q4 2021\n\n###### Types of Threat Activity\n\n|Types of Threat Activity|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|eCrime|Financially motivated criminal intrusion activity|\n|Targeted|State-sponsored intrusion activity that includes cyber espionage, state-nexus destruction attacks and generating currency to support a regime|\n|Hacktivist|Intrusion activity undertaken to gain momentum, visibility or publicity for a cause or ideology|\n|Unattributed|Insufficient data were available to make a confident attribution|\n\n\nQ2 2020 Q3 2020 Q4 2020 Q1 2021 Q2 2021 Q3 2021 Q4 2021\n\n\n-----\n\nFinancially motivated eCrime activity continues to dominate the interactive intrusion\nattempts tracked by OverWatch. Intrusions attributed to eCrime accounted for\nnearly half (49%) of the observed activity, while targeted intrusions accounted for\n18%, hacktivist activity was responsible for 1% and the remaining 32% of attacks\nremain unattributed. The distribution of these figures is similar to that of 2020.\n\n###### Interactive Intrusion Campaigns by Threat Type 2020 vs. 2021\n\neCrime Hacktivist Targeted Unattributed\n\n###### 2021 2020\n\n 13% 34%\n 18% 32%\n\n 1% 49%\n 1% 52%\n\n\neCrime Hacktivist Targeted Unattributed\n\n###### 2020\n\n 34%\n 32%\n\n 49%\n 52%\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 2021 Themes\n Ransomware\n and the\n Ever-adaptable\n Adversary\n\nThe growth and impact of BGH in 2021 was a palpable force felt across all sectors\nand in nearly every region of the world. Although some adversaries and ransomware\nceased operations in 2021, the overall number of operating ransomware families\nincreased. CrowdStrike Intelligence observed an 82% increase in ransomwarerelated data leaks in 2021, with 2,686 attacks as of Dec. 31, 2021, compared to 1,474\nin 2020. These figures, coupled with other data leaks, highlight how valuable victim\ndata is to adversaries.\n\n###### Increase in ransomware- related data leaks in 2021\n#### %\n### 82\n\n###### Number of attacks\n\n3,000\n\n2,500\n\n###### 2,686\n\n2,000\n\n1,500\n\n1,000 **1,474**\n\n500\n\n0\n\n2021 2020\n\n**Figure 2.

Comparison of Data Leaks by Sector (Top 10), 2020 vs. 2021**\n\nAt times, the BGH landscape has been unpredictable, and adversaries have not\nalways been able to immediately gauge the success or outcome of their ransomware\noperations. This change in landscape fluidity was observed following operations\nthat targeted large organizations and resulted in attention and action from the\nhighest levels of U.S. government and law enforcement, causing some adversaries to\nrebrand or even deactivate their tools.\n\n\nThe impact of government and law enforcement action on eCrime operations was\n[also observed in the CrowdStrike eCrime Index (ECX). For example, increased](https://adversary.crowdstrike.com/en-US/ecrime-index-ecx/)\nmedia and law enforcement attention after the Colonial Pipeline and JBS Foods\nincidents conducted by CARBON SPIDER and PINCHY SPIDER affiliates resulted in\na reduction in data leaks and access broker advertisements, which caused the ECX\n[to dip, recover and remain volatile to date. For more detail, read this blog.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/how-big-game-hunting-ttps-shifted-after-darkside-pipeline-attack/)\n\nNew tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) used in data theft attacks in 2021\naided adversaries in extorting their victims. For example, adversaries such as\nBITWISE SPIDER avoided using publicly available exfiltration tools by developing\ntheir own. Another major development was increased data theft and extortion\nwithout the use of ransomware, leading to the establishment of new marketplaces\ndedicated to advertising and selling victim data.\n\n\nHowever, one key theme highlighted throughout 2021 is that adversaries will\ncontinue to react and move operations to new approaches or malware wherever\npossible, demonstrating that the ever-adaptable adversary remains the key threat\nwithin the eCrime landscape.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Falcon OverWatch \n\n\n###### Case Study\n\n|Col1|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|||\n|||\n|||\n|||\n|||\n|||\n\n\n###### Case Study\n\n WIZARD SPIDER Accesses Multiple Servers\n During Targeted BGH Operation\n\nWIZARD SPIDER was a prolific figure on the ransomware scene in 2021. With a wealth of custom tooling at their\ndisposal and proficiency at using native utilities to progress their intrusions, WIZARD SPIDER identified and developed\na successful business model. OverWatch uncovered this threat actor in an intrusion against an organization in the\nengineering vertical. The TTPs observed throughout this intrusion were consistent with targeted BGH activity seen from\nWIZARD SPIDER in the past. The intrusion spanned four domain controllers and two valid accounts.\n\n**Domain**\n**Controller**\n\n**Count: 1**\n\n###### Defense Evasion and Discovery\n\nWIZARD SPIDER utilized RDP to authenticate into a\nWindows Domain Controller via a valid domain account.\nThe Falcon sensor raised the first of multiple detections\n\nwhen malware was injected into the legitimate MSTSC\nprocess by a custom shellcode loader, ShellStarter. Falcon **Persistence**\n\nOverWatch uncovered the adversary leveraging two\n\nThe threat actor created a scheduled task to\n\nnative utilities, BITSadmin and Rundll32, to download and\n\nexecute ShellStarter at a later date, potentially with\n\nexecute their custom tooling. OverWatch hunters quickly\n\nthe intent to reinfect the victim.\n\nzeroed in on uncovering the activity’s context, armed with\n\nCrowdStrike Falcon® sensor telemetry providing insights\ninto the associated process trees. A notification was then\n\npushed to the victim organization. **Domain**\n\n**Controller**\n**Count: 2**\n\n###### Credential Access\n\nMinutes later, WIZARD SPIDER moved laterally using RDP\nto access a second domain controller using the same valid\n\n###### Command and Control (C2)\n\ncredentials. Here they used the built-in Ntdsutil utility to\n\nThe actor pushed a rogue DLL file to another server harvest credentials by copying the NTDS database.\nbefore executing the DLL using the Microsoft signed\nbinary Rundll32. In this instance, the WIZARD SPIDER tool,\n_AnchorDNS, was used to perform C2 connections over the_\n\nDNS protocol. Multiple encoded DNS requests were sent **Domain**\n\noutbound to the C2 nameserver. **Controller**\n\n**Count: 3**\n\n**Domain** **Lateral Movement**\n**Controller**\n\n**Count: 4** WIZARD SPIDER moved laterally to a third domain controller\n\nthrough a Windows administrative share and set AnchorDNS to\n\n###### Persistence run as a service using native tooling.\n\nActing on CrowdStrike's notifications, the victim\norganization’s incident response took over at this point and\n\nbegan eliminating the actor within the environment. During\nremediation, OverWatch identified WIZARD SPIDER returning\n\nto a fourth domain controller using a new administrator\naccount. OverWatch rapidly notified the victim, and the actor\n\nwas once again removed from the environment.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CrowdStrike Intelligence is currently tracking several adversaries and activity clusters that are engaged in lock-and-leak operations.\n\n\nSince late 2020, multiple Iran-nexus adversaries and activity clusters have adopted\nthe use of ransomware as well as “lock-and-leak” disruptive information operations\n(IO) to target multiple organizations within the U.S., Israel and the greater Middle\nEast and North Africa (MENA) region. Lock-and-leak operations are characterized\nby criminal or hacktivist fronts using ransomware to encrypt target networks and\nsubsequently leak victim information via actor-controlled personas or entities.\nSince they inauthentically operate as a criminal or hacktivist entity, these types\nof operations conduct activity beneath a veneer of deniability. Through the use\nof dedicated leak sites, social media and chat platforms, these actors are able to\namplify data leaks and conduct IO against target countries.\n\nAt present, CrowdStrike Intelligence is tracking several adversaries and activity\nclusters that are engaged in lock-and-leak operations. Based on available data,\nPIONEER KITTEN was the first adversary to switch from conducting likely traditional\ntargeted intrusion operations to lock-and-leak activities in 2021. Following that,\nSPECTRAL KITTEN (aka BlackShadow), the ChaoticOrchestra activity cluster (aka\n_Deus) and the SplinteredEnvoy activity cluster (aka Moses Staff) were observed_\nprimarily targeting Israeli entities with lock-and-leak operations throughout 2021\nusing multiple ransomware families.\n\nIn contrast to the publicity-seeking operations and lock-and-leak campaigns\nobserved throughout 2021, disruptive activity associated with the NEMESIS KITTEN\nadversary lacked a distinct messaging component and largely operated discreetly.\nNEMESIS KITTEN conducted wide-ranging scanning and exploitation operations\nto establish footholds in various networks, and in select instances, conducted\nransomware operations using BitLocker, a likely unique ransomware variant called\n_SunDawn, and, in one case, a custom wiper._\n\nThe use of high-profile lock-and-leak operations, as well as the more subdued but\npervasive NEMESIS KITTEN activity, provides Iran with an effective capability to\ndisruptively target its rivals in the region and abroad. Given the success of these\noperations, Iran will likely continue to use disruptive ransomware into 2022.\n\n\n###### 2021 Themes\n Iran and the New Face of Disruptive Operations\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Falcon OverWatch \n\n\n###### Case Study\n\n|Col1|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|||\n||l|\n|||\n|||\n\n\n###### NEMESIS KITTEN Thwarted at Every Turn\n\nIn late 2021, OverWatch uncovered a hands-on intrusion against a South American technology entity. The observed\nTTPs, along with the use of specific tooling including the Fatedier Reverse Proxy tool, were consistent with activity\npreviously attributed to the threat actor tracked by CrowdStrike Intelligence as NEMESIS KITTEN. The actor’s efforts\nwere largely unsuccessful because they were blocked at every turn by the Falcon sensor.\n\n###### Defense Evasion\n\nThe actor was observed making numerous\nattempts to disable Windows Defender, including\n\nmodifying the Windows registry to disable\nWindows Defender real-time monitoring and using\n\nPowerShell to create a scheduled task configured\n\nto use the Set-MpPreference cmdlet to impair\nWindows Defender protections. This was the first\nof multiple attempted attack techniques blocked by\n\n###### Persistence and C2\n\nthe Falcon sensor.\n\nThe actor attempted to create a scheduled task to\ndownload and execute the Fatedier Reverse Proxy tool\nconfigured to communicate with known NEMESIS KITTEN\nC2 infrastructure. This attempt was prevented by the\nFalcon sensor. In an attempt to establish persistence, the\nactor created a new local user account, then added the\naccount to the Administrators and Remote Desktop Users\nlocal groups. The adversary then set the account password\nto never expire. Additionally, the actor unsuccessfully\nattempted to modify the registry to enable inbound RDP\n\n###### Discovery connections.\n\nAfter the failed attempts to establish persistence\nand C2, NEMESIS KITTEN undertook host and user\n\nreconnaissance, which included efforts to locate\n\nDomain Controller-related information.\n\n###### Credential Access\n\nFinally, the actor attempted to perform credential harvesting\nby modifying the registry to enable WDigest and allow for the\nstorage of credentials in plain text. The actor then attempted\nto use PowerShell, along with Rundll32, to launch\n```\n                                     comsvcs.dll with minidump and extract contents of\n\n```\nLocal Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS). This\nattempt proved unsuccessful as well, thanks to the advanced\ncapabilities of the Falcon sensor.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 2021 Themes\n China Emerges as Leader in Vulnerability Exploitation\n\nCrowdStrike Intelligence observed China-nexus actors deploying exploits for new\nvulnerabilities at a significantly elevated rate in 2021, when compared to 2020.\n\nIn 2020, CrowdStrike Intelligence confirmed the exploitation by China-nexus\nactors — including WICKED PANDA — of two vulnerabilities published in 2020:\nCVE-2020-14882 (Oracle WebLogic) and CVE-2020-10189 (Zoho ManageEngine).\nIn 2021, CrowdStrike Intelligence confirmed China-nexus actor exploitation of\n12 vulnerabilities published in 2021, affecting nine different products. Ten named\nadversaries or activity clusters were linked to the exploitation of these vulnerabilities\nand a number of other incidents were identified in which activity was likely linked to\nunnamed Chinese actors.\n\nChinese actors have long developed and deployed exploits to facilitate targeted\nintrusion operations; however, 2021 highlighted a shift in their preferred exploitation\nmethods. For years, Chinese actors relied on exploits that required user interaction,\nwhether by opening malicious documents or other files attached to emails or visiting\nwebsites hosting malicious code. In contrast, exploits deployed by these actors in\n2021 focused heavily on vulnerabilities in internet-facing devices or services.\n\n## 2021\n\n###### China-nexus actors exploited 12 published vulnerabilities\n 2020 China-nexus actors exploited 2 published vulnerabilities\n\n\n###### 2020\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 2021 Themes China Emerges as Leader in Vulnerability Exploitation\n\nIn 2021, Chinese actors focused significant attention on a series of vulnerabilities in\nMicrosoft Exchange — now collectively known as ProxyLogon and ProxyShell — and\nused them to launch intrusions against numerous organizations worldwide. Chinese\nadversaries also continued to exploit internet-routing products such as VPNs and\nrouters for both infrastructure acquisition and initial access purposes. Enterprise\nsoftware products hosted on internet-facing servers were also popular targets.\nCrowdStrike Intelligence observed Chinese actors exploit products for initial access in\na range of intrusions such as Zoho ManageEngine, Atlassian Confluence and GitLab.[1]\n\nActivity from China-nexus actors in 2021 highlighted their range of exploitacquisition capabilities. Chinese targeted intrusion actors likely independently\ndeveloped a number of the observed exploits or acquired them from in-country\nsecurity researchers. In particular, the Tianfu Cup hacking competition demonstrates\nthe significant exploitation development talent within China’s hacker community.\nExploits submitted at the Tianfu Cup have later been acquired by Chinese targeted\nintrusion actors for use in their operations. In several 2021 incidents, Chinese actors\ndemonstrated an ability to rapidly operationalize public proof-of-concept (POC)\nexploit code for newly acknowledged vulnerabilities.\n\n**Figure 4. Timeline of Zero-day Exploits Deployed by China-nexus Actors in 2021**\n\n1 Relevant zero-day vulnerabilities exploited in connection to this activity affected Zoho ManageEngine\n(CVE-2021-40539, CVE-2021-44515 and CVE-2021-440077), Atlassian Confluence (CVE-2021-26084)\nand GitLab (CVE-2021-22205)\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Falcon OverWatch \n\n\n###### Case Study\n\n|Col1|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|||\n|||\n|||\n|||\n|||\n\n\n###### Suspected PANDA Exploits Microsoft Exchange Server Vulnerabilities Against Think Tank\n\nFalcon OverWatch uncovered a targeted threat actor conducting a hands-on intrusion against a Europe-based think tank.\nThe activity, which spanned multiple Windows-based hosts, began after the successful exploitation of a known Microsoft\nExchange vulnerability. The adversary employed several notable TTPs in an effort to secure a persistent foothold in\nthe victim environment. The adversary also showed a particular interest in gathering credential information, using four\ndistinct credential dumping and harvesting techniques.\n\n###### Initial Access\n\nThe adversary gained initial access to the primary host\n\nfollowing the successful compromise of the Microsoft\n\nExchange application pool MSExchangeOWAAppPool.\nOverWatch hunters promptly discovered this malicious **Discovery**\n\naccess after seeing the Microsoft IIS worker process\n\nInitial access was immediately followed by attempts\n```\n       w3wp.exe writing an unknown executable on the host,\n```\nat broad host- and user-based reconnaissance\n\nwith malicious scripts being written to a web directory.\n\noperations.\n\nThis activity included command execution indicative\nof China Chopper web shell usage, triggering an initial\n\nFalcon detection.\n\n###### Execution\n\nOperating as the SYSTEM user, the adversary deployed\nmultiple instances of the China Chopper web shell and\nattempted to execute them via PowerShell beneath the\n\n###### Persistence and Lateral Movement IIS worker process w3wp.exe, but they were immediately\n\ndetected by the Falcon sensor.

The adversary was able to use\n\nRundll32 to successfully load their implant WmiAd.dll,\nwhich was configured to beacon to an adversary-controlled\n\nIP. The adversary also configured a scheduled task to\npersist the implant execution by setting it to launch on **Credential Access**\nhost startup. The adversary then moved laterally, using\n\nThe adversary attempted multiple LOTL techniques to extract\n\ncompromised credentials to authenticate to three hosts of\n\nthe contents of the LSASS memory space and seek credential\n\ninterest. They then copied their working implant file to the\n\ninformation stored in files.\n\nhosts and created a scheduled task to preserve access.\n\nThe second attempt involved the use of the Microsoft\nSysinternals tool ProcDump. The third attempt saw the\nadversary leverage their own tooling, executing a loader that\nwas then used to launch a probable credential dumping binary.\nFinally, the adversary used the findstr command to search\nfor credential-related information contained in .xml files on a\nremote share.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 2021 Themes\n Log4Shell\n Sets the Internet on Fire\n\nRoutine discovery, disclosure and subsequent exploitation of a series of high-profile\nvulnerabilities occurred throughout 2021. Due to the number of potentially affected\nendpoints, Log4Shell received more attention than any other vulnerability.\n\nApache’s Log4j2 is an ubiquitous logging library used by many web applications.\nA vulnerability reported in November 2021 and tracked as CVE-2021-44228 and\n“Log4Shell” can be exploited by remote attackers to inject arbitrary Java code into\naffected services. Specially crafted requests may result in access to the system,\ndelivery of malware or acquisition of sensitive data such as user credentials.\n\nBetween Dec. 9-31, 2021, a variety of groups incorporated Log4Shell exploitation\ninto their arsenal (Figure 5). Opportunistic eCrime actors aggressively engaged\nin widespread Log4Shell exploitation most commonly affiliated with commodity\nbotnet malware (e.g., Muhstik). However, other eCrime-focused actors — including\naffiliates of DOPPEL SPIDER and WIZARD SPIDER — adopted Log4Shell as an\naccess vector to enable ransomware operations. Additionally, state-nexus actors,\nincluding NEMESIS KITTEN and AQUATIC PANDA, were also affiliated with probable\nLog4Shell exploitation before the end of 2021.\n\n\nLog4Shell exploitation before the end of 2021.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 2021 Themes Log4Shell Sets\n the Internet on Fire\n\nLog4j2 RCE\nreported\nto Apache\n\n###### NOV\n\n Log4Shell Zero-day\n\n Log4Shell in the Wild\n\n**Figure 5.**\n\n###### STAY UP-TO-DATE ON LOG4SHELL Visit the CrowdStrike Log4j/\"Log4Shell\" Vulnerability Learning Center.\n\n\nPartial\n\nPROPHET\n\nfix CVE-2021-44228\n\nSPIDER\nuses Log4Shell\n\n###### DEC\n\nThe initial wave of opportunistic Log4Shell attacks was very simple, and each exploit\nwas structured nearly identically. However, achieving reliable remote code execution\n(RCE) via CVE-2021-44228 on various impacted platforms potentially requires the\nactor to tailor the Log4Shell exploit for a specific target. While this adds effort, this\ntailoring has not prevented actors such as AQUATIC PANDA from leveraging more\nspecific versions of CVE-2021-44228 exploits. In particular, CrowdStrike Intelligence\nand industry sources linked Log4Shell exploitation to the compromise of VMware\nproducts.\n\nDue to the widespread nature of the Log4j2 logging library, it is difficult to assess\nwhich products are vulnerable and ensure they are protected against exploitation.\nTargeting of CVE-2021-44228 by criminal threat groups is increasing and will\ncontinue into 2022.\n\nMany state-operated actors are likely to integrate Log4Shell exploits into their\ntoolchain, since this logging library provides a method through which actors can gain\naccess to target environments via vulnerable entry point systems or move laterally\nby exploiting internal servers on already compromised networks. This assessment\nis based on the vulnerability’s massive prevalence. However, all impacted products\ncannot be exploited with the same technique, and tailoring of exploits for specific\ntargets may be required.\n\nCrowdStrike Intelligence assesses that actors will continue to integrate increasingly\neffective exploit chains to rapidly achieve RCE. This assessment is made with\nmoderate confidence based on the substantial number of incidents facilitated by\nmultistage exploit chains — such as ProxyShell and ProxyLogon — that proved\ncommonplace during 2021.\n\n\n###### Log4Shell Zero-day\n\n Log4Shell in the Wild\n\n\n-----\n\n|Col1|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|||\n|||\n|||\n|||\n\n\n###### Falcon OverWatch \n Case Study\n\n PROPHET SPIDER Leverages Log4j Exploit for Attempted Credential Harvesting from a Cloud Workspace Service\n\nPROPHET SPIDER is a prolific access broker with a track record of successfully leveraging known vulnerabilities to\ngain access to web servers and cloud services in order to harvest credentials. OverWatch recently uncovered a hands-\non intrusion against a U.S.-based financial services entity following the successful compromise of a VMware Horizon\nweb component. Observed TTPs were consistent with those previously seen from PROPHET SPIDER and included the\nretrieval of tooling from an actor-controlled IP, along with host and domain reconnaissance.\n\n###### C2 and Persistence\n\nUpon initial access to the host, PROPHET SPIDER\n\nimmediately leveraged obfuscated PowerShell\nto download a wget binary, which they then used\nto download a custom proxy tool. The suspicious\nPowerShell activity triggered an initial Falcon sensor\ndetection, and OverWatch hunters created additional\n\nnotifications on the actor’s activity.\n\n###### Discovery\n\nPROPHET SPIDER performed host and\nactive directory reconnaissance, including the\nenumeration of domain trust information along with\nactive directory topology and replication status.\n\n###### Execution and Discovery\n\nPROPHET SPIDER used the Windows Command\nshell to launch their custom proxy tool, winntaa.exe.\n\nOnce executed, they leveraged it to conduct more\ndiscovery operations, including gathering information\n\non domain trusts and running processes.\n\n###### Defense Evasion\n\nPROPHET SPIDER proceeded to delete their tooling\nfrom the host in an effort to prevent artifact recovery\noperations.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 2021 Themes\n Increasing Threats to Cloud Environments\n\nCloud-based services now form crucial elements of many business processes,\neasing file sharing and collaboration. However, these same services are increasingly\nabused by malicious actors in the course of computer network operations (CNO),\na trend that is likely to continue in the foreseeable future as more businesses seek\nhybrid work environments. Common cloud attack vectors used by eCrime and\ntargeted intrusion adversaries include cloud vulnerability exploitation, credential\ntheft, cloud service provider abuse, use of cloud services for malware hosting and\nC2, and the exploitation of misconfigured image containers.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 2021 Themes Increasing Threats\n to Cloud Environments\n\n\n###### Cloud Vulnerability Exploitation\n\nMalicious actors tend to opportunistically exploit known RCE vulnerabilities in server\nsoftware, typically scanning for vulnerable servers without focusing on particular\nsectors or regions. After initial access, actors may deploy a variety of tools. Wider\ncriminal exploitation of cloud services for initial access includes the exploitation of\nAccellion FTA vulnerabilities. Since January 2021, multiple companies have selfdisclosed breaches related to the exploitation of such vulnerabilities.\n\nVMware has also been targeted by threat actors, including CVE-2021-21972 — a\ncritical vulnerability impacting VMware ESXi, vCenter Server and Cloud foundation\nproducts. Targeting this vulnerability provides a simple and reliable method for\nexploitation that threat actors can use across multiple host-operating systems,\nattack vectors and intrusion stages. Multiple adversaries, particularly BGH actors,\nhave likely leveraged this vulnerability.\n\n###### Credential Theft\n\nCredential-based intrusions against cloud environments are among the more\nprevalent exploitation vectors used by eCrime and targeted intrusion adversaries.\nCriminal actors routinely host fake authentication pages to harvest legitimate\nauthentication credentials for cloud services such as Microsoft Office 365 (O365),\nOkta or online webmail accounts. Actors then use these credentials to attempt to\naccess victim accounts.\n\nAccess to cloud-hosted email or file-hosting services can also facilitate espionage\nand theft of information. In April 2021, CrowdStrike observed COSMIC WOLF\ntargeting victim data stored within the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud\nenvironment. The adversary compromised the AWS environment via a stolen\ncredential that allowed the operator to interact with AWS using the command line.\nEmploying this technique, the adversary altered security group settings to allow\ndirect SSH access from malicious infrastructure.\n\n###### Cloud Service Provider Abuse\n\nAdversaries have leveraged cloud service providers to abuse provider trust\nrelationships and gain access to additional targets through lateral movement from\nenterprise authentication assets hosted on cloud infrastructure. If an adversary\ncan elevate their privileges to global administrator levels, they may be able to pivot\nbetween related cloud tenants to further their access.\n\nThis issue is particularly significant if the initially targeted organization is a managed\nservice provider (MSP). In this case, global administrator access can be used to\ntake over support accounts used by the MSP to make changes to their customer\nnetworks, thereby creating multiple opportunities for vertical propagation to many\nmore networks. This technique was used by COZY BEAR throughout 2020, with\nevidence of continued intrusion in MSP networks continuing into 2021.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Malware Hosting and\n Command and Control\n\nBoth eCrime and targeted intrusion adversaries extensively leverage legitimate cloud\nservices to deliver malware; targeted actors also use these services for command\nand control. This tactic has the advantage of being able to evade signature-based\ndetections, because top-level domains of cloud hosting services are typically trusted\nby many network scanning services. Using legitimate cloud services, including chat\napplications, can enable adversaries to evade some security controls by blending\ninto normal network traffic. Moreover, using cloud-hosting providers for C2 allows\nthe adversary to switch or remove payloads from an affiliated C2 URL with ease.\n\n###### Exploitation of Misconfigured\n Image Containers\n\nCriminal actors have periodically exploited improperly configured Docker containers.\nDocker images are templates used for creating containers. These images can be\nused either on a standalone basis, for users to directly interact with a tool or service,\nor as the parent to another application. Because of this hierarchical mode, if an\nimage has been modified to contain malicious tooling, any container derived from it\nwill also be infected.\n\nIn 2021, CrowdStrike Intelligence reported on the malware family Doki, which uses\ncontainers as both an initial infection vector and as a means for parallel track\ntasking. Once malicious actors gain access, they can abuse these escalated\nprivileges to accomplish lateral movement and then proliferate throughout the\nnetwork.\n\nCrowdStrike Intelligence has also continued to track adversary operations involving\nthe access and modification of constituent parts of Kubernetes clusters. Kubernetes\nis an open-source container-orchestration system that automates the deployment,\nscaling and management of applications and their associated shared resources.\nFalcon OverWatch has observed increasing adversary interest in Kubernetes\nclusters operating within corporate environments. The Kubernetes framework\nis a complex system comprising a number of constituent parts allowing ample\nopportunity for misconfiguration that could provide an adversary with initial access\nto one component and subsequent lateral propagation opportunities that provide\naccess to desired resources.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Threat Highlight:\n Russian Adversaries Look to the Cloud\n\n FANCY BEAR\n\nThe FANCY BEAR adversary is associated with the 85th Main Center of the Special\nServices (aka Military Unit 26165) of Russia’s Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU).\nEarlier in its operational lifespan, when conducting victim exploitation and credential\ncollection, the adversary extensively used spear-phishing emails containing\nmalicious documents or links that redirected to malicious infrastructure. However,\nafter multiple exposures of its operations — particularly by the U.S. Department of\nJustice (DOJ) in 2018 — FANCY BEAR appears to have reevaluated their operational\ntradecraft and decreased their use of malware while shifting toward increased use\nof credential-harvesting tactics including both large-scale scanning techniques and\nvictim-tailored phishing websites.\n\nCredential harvesting plays a significant role in FANCY BEAR’s acquisition of\nintelligence and primary access into target organizations or individuals. Adapting\nto the trend of public and private entities increasingly hosting parts of their internal\ninfrastructure (e.g., email, internal chat, or identity and device-management services)\nvia cloud services, the adversary has targeted numerous cloud-based email\nproviders with a variety of collection methodologies throughout 2021. Examples\nof targeted email providers include enterprise services such as Microsoft 365 or\nGSuite, as well as webmail services more likely used by individuals. The adversary’s\ncredential-collection operations have technically matured over the years while\nmaintaining a consistently high volume and tempo.\n\n###### COZY BEAR\n\nThroughout 2021, COZY BEAR also repeatedly demonstrated a high level of\npost-exploitation proficiency, particularly involving the enumeration of, and lateral\nmovement within, cloud environments. During a CrowdStrike Services investigation,\nCOZY BEAR operators were identified using authentication cookie theft to bypass\nmultifactor authentication (MFA) restrictions implemented on target networks. This\ntechnique leverages existing local network access and has been used to access\nuser accounts in possession of enterprise cloud service privileges. This technique\nhighlights the adversary’s ability to use a range of post-compromise activities to\nexpand their access and maximize intelligence collection.\n\nFuture operations consistent with this cluster of COZY BEAR-associated activity are\nhighly likely to continue mirroring this behavior, particularly through the successive\nidentification and compromise of user accounts that are assigned administrative\nor special privileges on cloud services and tenants. This assessment is made with\nmoderate confidence based on the increasing application of MFA restrictions\non cloud service access and the consistency of COZY BEAR-related operations\nidentified to date.\n\n\nmaintaining a consistently high volume and tempo.\n\n###### COZY BEAR\n\nexpand their access and maximize intelligence collection.\n\nidentified to date.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Conclusion\n\n\n###### CrowdStrike Intelligence continues to provide industry-leading actor profiles, malware analysis and campaign tracking through its suite of intelligence reporting products and coverage of threat landscapes.\n\n\nIn 2021, CrowdStrike Intelligence observed adversaries continue to adapt to security\nenvironments impacted by the ongoing COVID pandemic. These adversaries are\nlikely to look at novel ways in which they can bypass security measures to conduct\nsuccessful initial infections, impede analysis by researchers and continue tried-andtested techniques into 2022.\n\nBGH operations will continue to dominate the eCrime landscape in 2022, likely\nsignificantly increasing their use of ransomware from ransomware-as-a-service\n(RaaS) operations in an effort to allow for a wider array of adversarial skill sets.\nThe access broker market will also continue as an avenue for ransomware\noperators to gain victims, removing the initial access step and allowing swifter\ndeployment of malware.\n\nTargeted intrusion adversaries are expected to continue to capitalize on trends\nin technology and the broader threat landscape throughout 2022 in attempts to\nmaximize impacts while minimizing effort. (In 2021, this behavior was reflected in\nIran’s shift to disruptive ransomware, China’s emphasis on vulnerability exploitation —\noften at scale — to achieve initial access to victims, and Russia’s targeting of cloud\nservice providers and environments.) Cloud-related threats are particularly likely\nto become more prevalent and to evolve, given that targeted intrusion adversaries\nare expected to continue prioritizing targets that provide direct access to large\nconsolidated stores of high-value data.\n\nAs today’s world continues to increasingly rely on mobile devices, some adversaries\nwill continue to diversify their tool arsenal to include mobile malware — either to\nmake money and/or collect sensitive information. Similarly, adversaries will continue\nto seek weaknesses in platforms used by their targets in 2022; opportunities to\nexploit vulnerabilities will be capitalized upon once they are discovered. Through\nthe coming year, adversaries are expected to continue to react to vulnerability\nidentification and seek to gain access to their targets through exploitive means as\nquickly as possible.\n\nIn response to these evolving threats, CrowdStrike Intelligence continues to provide\nindustry-leading actor profiles, malware analysis and campaign tracking through its\nsuite of reporting products and coverage of threat landscapes spanning targeted\nintrusion, eCrime, hacktivist, vulnerability and mobile threat intelligence.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Recommendations\n\n\n# 01\n\n 02 03\n\n 04\n\n\n###### Protect All Workloads\n\nAn organization is only secure if every asset is protected. You must secure all\ncritical areas of enterprise risk: endpoints and cloud workloads, identity and data.\nLook for solutions that deliver hyper-accurate detections, automated protection\nand remediation, elite threat hunting and prioritized observability of vulnerabilities.\nEstablish strong IT hygiene with an asset inventory and consistent vulnerability\nmanagement. Remember, it’s impossible to defend systems you don’t know are\nthere.\n\n###### Know Your Adversary\n\nThere is a human behind every cyberattack. If you know the adversaries that\ntarget the industry or the geolocation your organization resides in, you can prepare\nyourself to better defend against the tools and tactics they employ.\n[CrowdStrike Falcon Intelligence identifies today’s bad actors and exposes their](https://www.crowdstrike.com/endpoint-security-products/falcon-x-threat-intelligence/)\nplaybook to enable security teams to proactively optimize preventions, strengthen\ndefenses and accelerate incident response.\n\n###### Be Ready When Every Second Counts\n\nSpeed often dictates success or failure. It’s especially true in cybersecurity where\nstealthy breaches can occur in a matter of hours with devastating consequences.\nSecurity teams of all sizes must invest in speed and agility for their daily and\ntactical decision making by automating preventive, detection, investigative and\nresponse workflows with integrated cyber threat intelligence directly observed from\nthe front lines.\n\n###### Stop Modern Attacks\n\nNearly 80% of cyberattacks leverage identity-based attacks to compromise\nlegitimate credentials and use techniques like lateral movement to quickly evade\ndetection. CrowdStrike Falcon Identity Threat Protection enables hyper-accurate\nthreat detection and real-time prevention of identity-based attacks, combining the\npower of advanced AI, behavioral analytics and a flexible policy engine to enforce\nrisk-based conditional access.\n\n\n-----\n\n# 05\n\n 06\n\n 07 08\n\n 09\n\n\n###### Adopt Zero Trust\n\nAs adversaries want to monetize their activity, they target their victim’s data seeking\npayoffs through ransom and extortion, and will even auction data to the highest\nbidder. Because today’s global economy requires data to be accessible from\n[anywhere at any time, it is critical to adopt a Zero Trust model. The CrowdStrike](https://www.crowdstrike.com/resources/white-papers/guide-to-frictionless-zero-trust-for-modern-enterprises/)\n[Zero Trust solution connects the machine to the identity and the data to deliver full](https://www.crowdstrike.com/zero-trust/)\nZero Trust protection.\n\n###### Monitor the Criminal Underground\n\nAdversaries congregate to collaborate using a variety of hidden messaging platforms\nand dark web forums. In addition to monitoring your own environment, security teams\nmust be vigilant and monitor activity within the criminal underground. Leverage digital\n[risk monitoring tools like Falcon Intelligence Recon to monitor imminent threats to](https://www.crowdstrike.com/products/threat-intelligence/falcon-x-recon/)\nyour brand, identities or data. Get advance warnings of active threats and use this\nvisibility to prevent data leak incidents and costly ransomware attacks.\n\n###### Eliminate Misconfigurations\n\nThe most common causes of cloud intrusions continue to be human errors such as\nomissions introduced during common administrative activities. It’s important to set\nup new infrastructure with default patterns that make secure operations easy to\nadopt. This strategy ensures that new accounts are set up in a predictable manner,\neliminating common sources of human error. Also, make sure to set up roles and\nnetwork security groups that keep developers and operators from needing to build\ntheir own security profiles and accidentally doing it poorly.\n\n###### Invest in Elite Threat Hunting\n\nCrowdStrike has observed that 62% of attacks comprise non-malware, hands-onkeyboard activity. As adversaries advance their tradecraft in this manner to bypass\nlegacy security solutions, autonomous machine learning alone is not good enough to\nstop dedicated attackers. The combination of technology with expert threat hunters\nis absolutely mandatory to see and stop the most sophisticated threats. Top-quality\n[managed services such as Falcon Complete and Falcon OverWatch can help you](https://www.crowdstrike.com/endpoint-security-products/falcon-complete/)\nclose the growing cyber skills gap with the expertise, resources and coverage\nneeded to augment your team.\n\n###### Build a Cybersecurity Culture\n\nWhile technology is clearly critical in the fight to detect and stop intrusions, the\nend user remains a crucial link in the chain to stop breaches. User awareness\nprograms should be initiated to combat the continued threat of phishing and\nrelated social engineering techniques. For security teams, practice makes perfect.\nEncourage an environment that routinely performs table top exercises and red/\nblue teaming to identify gaps and eliminate weaknesses in your cybersecurity\npractices and response.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### About CrowdStrike\n\n[CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.
