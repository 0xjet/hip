However, this may differ from one system to another.\n\nFortunately, the malicious executable is detected by most popular antivirus products on the\nmarket. A [scan on VirusTotal shows that it is detected by 36 out of 68 antivirus engine.](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/a127323192abed93aed53648d03ca84de3b5b006b641033eb46a520b7a3c16fc/detection)\n\n## Homoglyph attack\n\n\n-----\n\nAt a first look, the web page seems genuine as cybercriminals used visuals and the\nstructure present on the original page.\n\nTo add to the deception, the cybercriminals also use what is known as homograph domain\nname spoofing for links to various sections of the site (Help & Contact, Fees, Security,\nApps, and Shop).\n\nThe crooks achieved this by using in the domain name Unicode characters from different\nalphabets. To distinguish between them, browsers automatically translate them into\n[Punycode. In this case, what in Unicode looks like paypal.com translates to 'xn--ayal-](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punycode)\nf6dc.com' in Punycode.\n\n[Security researcher Vitali Kremez analyzing this variant of Nemty ransomware noted that it](https://twitter.com/VK_Intel)\nis now at version 1.4, which comes with minor bug fixes.\n\nOne thing the researcher observed is that the \"isRU\" check, which verifies if the infected\ncomputer is in Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, or Ukraine, has been modified. In\nthe latest version, if the result of the check is positive, the malware does not move with the\nfile-encrypting function, the researcher told BleepingComputer.\n\ncredit: [Vitali Kremez](https://twitter.com/VK_Intel/status/1170785426875064325?s=20)\nComputers outside these countries, though, are a target and will have their files encrypted\nand their shadow copies deleted.\n\nNemty ransomware has been present on cybercriminal forums for some time but it emerged\non the radar of the infosec community towards the end of August, when security researcher\n[Vitali Kremez published details of his analysis. The expert noticed in the code messages](https://twitter.com/VK_Intel)\nand references that made the malware stand out.\n\n\n-----\n\n[BleepingComputer tests showed that the ransom demand was 0.09981 BTC, which is about](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-nemty-ransomware-may-spread-via-compromised-rdp-connections/)\n$1,000, and that the payment portal is hosted in the Tor network for anonymity.\n\nAt the end of August, another security researcher, [Mol69, saw Nemty being](https://twitter.com/tkanalyst) distributed via\nRIG EK, which is probably an odd choice considering that exploit kits are on the brink of\nextinction as they target products that are on their death bed: Internet Explorer, Flash\nPlayer.\n\nAccording to Yelisey Boguslavskiy of Advanced Intelligence, Nemty was received with \"with\nextreme skepticism and aggression\" on a cybercriminal forum, which is normal in that\ncommunity. This may also influence its success, which is nothing compared to what\n[Sodinokibi ransomware currently enjoys.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/a-look-inside-the-highly-profitable-sodinokibi-ransomware-business/)\n\n**Update [09/08/2019, 18:00 EST]: Article updated with new information from security**\nresearcher Vitali Kremez.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[New Bumblebee malware replaces Conti's BazarLoader in cyberattacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-bumblebee-malware-replaces-contis-bazarloader-in-cyberattacks/)\n\n[BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware asks $5 million to unlock Austrian state](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/blackcat-alphv-ransomware-asks-5-million-to-unlock-austrian-state/)\n\n[Intuit warns of QuickBooks phishing threatening to suspend accounts](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/intuit-warns-of-quickbooks-phishing-threatening-to-suspend-accounts/)\n\n[Windows 11 KB5014019 breaks Trend Micro ransomware protection](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-11-kb5014019-breaks-trend-micro-ransomware-protection/)\n\n[Industrial Spy data extortion market gets into the ransomware game](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/industrial-spy-data-extortion-market-gets-into-the-ransomware-game/)\n\n[Nemty Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/nemty-ransomware/)\n[PayPal](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/paypal/)\n[Phishing](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/phishing/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n\n[Ionut Ilascu](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/ionut-ilascu/)\n\nIonut Ilascu is a technology writer with a focus on all things cybersecurity.
