Sowbug has been seen mounting classic espionage attacks by stealing**\n\n**documents from the organizations it infiltrates.**\n\n**Symantec saw the first evidence of Sowbug-related activity with the discovery in March 2017**\n\n**of an entirely new piece of malware called Felismus used against a target in Southeast**\n\n**Asia. We have subsequently identified further victims on both sides of the Pacific Ocean.**\n\n**While the Felismus tool was first identified in March of this year, its association with Sowbug**\n\n**was unknown until now. Symantec has also been able to connect earlier attack campaigns**\n\n**with Sowbug, demonstrating that it has been active since at least early-2015 and may have**\n\n**been operating even earlier.**\n\n**To date, Sowbug appears to be focused mainly on government entities in South America**\n\n**and Southeast Asia and has infiltrated organizations in Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador, Peru,**\n\n\n**Like 3**\n\n\n-----\n\n**order to maintain a low profile.**\n\n##### Who are #Sowbug? New #espionage group very focused on foreign policy,\n\n diplomatic targets\n\n**[CLICK TO TWEET](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Who+are+%23Sowbug%3F+New+%23espionage+group+very+focused+on+foreign+policy%2C+diplomatic+targets&source=threatintel&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.symantec.com%2Fconnect%2Fblogs%2Fsowbug-cyber-espionage-group-targets-south-american-and-southeast-asian-governments&via=threatintel&related=symantec)**\n\n#### Highly targeted intrusions\n\n**Some clues about the motivation and interests of the attackers can be found in their**\n\n**activities after compromising victims. For example, in a 2015 attack on one South American**\n\n**foreign ministry, the group appeared to be searching for very specific information.**\n\n**The first evidence of its intrusion dated from May 6, 2015 but activity appeared to have**\n\n**begun in earnest on May 12. The attackers appeared to be interested in one division of the**\n\n**ministry that is responsible for relations with the Asia-Pacific region. They attempted to**\n\n**extract all Word documents stored on a file server belonging to this division by bundling**\n\n**them into a RAR archive by running the following command:**\n\n**cmd.exe /c c:\\windows\\rar.exe a -m5 -r -ta20150511000000 -v3072 c:\\recycler\\**\n\n**[REDACTED].rar \"\\\\[REDACTED]\\*.docx\" \\\\[REDACTED]\\*.doc.**\n\n**Interestingly, the command specified that only files modified from May 11, 2015 onwards**\n\n**should be archived.**\n\n**The attackers appear to have successfully extracted the archive because an hour later they**\n\n**returned, this time attempting to extract all documents modified from May 7, 2015, an extra**\n\n**four days’ worth of data. Presumably they either didn't find what they were looking for in the**\n\n**initial incursion, or else noticed something in the documents they stole earlier that prompted**\n\n**them to hunt for more information.**\n\n**The attackers didn’t stop there. Their next move was to list any remote shared drives and**\n\n**then attempt to access remote shares owned by the specific government office they were**\n\n**targeting, again attempting to extract all Word documents. In this case, they searched for**\n\n**any documents modified from May 9 onwards. The attackers then seemed to broaden their**\n\n**interest, listing the contents of various directories on remote shares, including one belonging**\n\n**to another division of the South American foreign ministry, this one responsible for relations**\n\n**with international organizations. They also deployed two unknown payloads to the infected**\n\n**server. In total, the attackers maintained a presence on the target’s network for four months**\n\n**between May and September 2015.**\n\n\n##### Who are #Sowbug? New #espionage group very focused on foreign policy,\n\n diplomatic targets\n\n**[CLICK TO TWEET](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Who+are+%23Sowbug%3F+New+%23espionage+group+very+focused+on+foreign+policy%2C+diplomatic+targets&source=threatintel&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.symantec.com%2Fconnect%2Fblogs%2Fsowbug-cyber-espionage-group-targets-south-american-and-southeast-asian-governments&via=threatintel&related=symantec)**\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Network traversal: Keeping a low profile\n\n**Sowbug frequently maintains a long-term presence on the networks of targeted**\n\n**organizations, sometimes remaining inside a victim environment for up to six months. One**\n\n**of the tactics it uses to avoid drawing attention to itself is impersonating commonly used**\n\n**software packages such as Windows or Adobe Reader. It has never attempted to**\n\n**compromise the software itself. Rather, it gives its tools file names similar to those used by**\n\n**the software and places them in directory trees that could be mistaken for those used by the**\n\n**legitimate software. This allows the attackers to hide in plain sight, as their appearance in**\n\n**process listings is unlikely to arouse suspicion.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Felismus backdoor on one of its computers, Computer A, using the file name adobecms.exe**\n\n**in CSIDL_WINDOWS\\debug. From there, it installed additional components and tools to a**\n\n**directory named CSIDL_APPDATA\\microsoft\\security.**\n\n**The attackers then began to perform reconnaissance activities on Computer A via cmd.exe,**\n\n**collecting system-related information, such as the OS version, hardware configuration, and**\n\n**network information. They then performed some further reconnaissance, attempting to**\n\n**identify all installed applications on the computer. They returned four days later, creating a**\n\n**sub-directory called “common” in the Adobe directory of the Program Files folder, i.e.**\n\n**c:\\Program Files\\Adobe\\common, and installed another tool in this sub-directory, again**\n\n**named adobecms.exe. This was possibly an updated version of the backdoor.**\n\n**The attackers’ network reconnaissance appeared to be successful because a second**\n\n**computer of interest in the organization was identified and compromised. The attackers then**\n\n**returned to Computer A, installing another executable called fb.exe. This file appears to be**\n\n**used to copy Felismus across the network to other computers and there is evidence that the**\n\n**attackers used it to attempt to infect at least two more computers.**\n\n**The attackers took further measures to remain under the radar by carrying out their**\n\n**operations outside of standard office hours. In this case, the attackers maintained a**\n\n**presence on the target’s network for nearly six months between September 2016 and March**\n\n**2017.**\n\n#### Infection vectors\n\n**How Sowbug performs its initial infiltration of a target’s network remains unknown. In some**\n\n**cases, there was no trace of how Felismus made its way onto compromised computers,**\n\n**meaning it was likely deployed from other compromised computers on the network. In other**\n\n**attacks, there was evidence that Felismus was installed using a tool known as Starloader**\n\n**(detected by Symantec as Trojan.Starloader). This is a loader that installs and decrypts data**\n\n**from a file called Stars.jpg. Additionally, Starloader was also observed deploying additional**\n\n**tools used by the attackers, such as credential dumpers and keyloggers.**\n\n**It is still unknown how Starloader is installed on the compromised computer. One possibility**\n\n**is that the attackers use fake software updates to install files. Symantec has found evidence**\n\n**of Starloader files being named AdobeUpdate.exe, AcrobatUpdate.exe, and**\n\n**INTELUPDATE.EXE among others. These were used to create versions of the Felismus**\n\n**backdoor as well as other tools.**\n\n#### Global threat\n\n**While cyber espionage attacks are often seen against targets in the U.S., Europe, and Asia,**\n\n\n-----\n\n**active cyber espionage operations has increased steadily in recent years and the**\n\n**emergence of Sowbug is a reminder that no region is immune to this kind of threat.**\n\n#### Protection\n\n**Symantec customers are protected against Sowbug and Symantec has also made efforts to**\n\n**notify identified targets of its operations.**\n\n**Customers with Intelligence Services or WebFilter-enabled products are protected against**\n\n**activity associated with the Sowbug group.
