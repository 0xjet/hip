This scheme spreads credentials to alleged private\nBitcoin investment platforms and lures victims with the promise of withdrawing hundreds of\nthousands of dollars worth of cryptocurrency from an already established account on the\nplatform(s).\n\nWhile being very similar to traditional Advance Fee Fraud schemes, this set of campaigns is\nmuch more sophisticated from a technical standpoint, is fully automated, and requires\nsubstantial victim interaction. The use of cryptocurrency, in this case, is also notable for the\nfollowing reasons:\n\nIt provides anonymity for both the attacker and the victim. Specifically for the victim,\nthey may find it appealing that the money would be acquired anonymously and taxfree.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt indicates that the threat actor is targeting individuals that are somewhat technically\nsavvy as they will need to be comfortable handling Bitcoin and a digital wallet.\n\n## Campaign Details\n\nProofpoint researchers detected the first of these campaigns in May 2021 using a\ncoins45[.]com landing page while the most recent version started in July 2021 and directs\npotential victims to securecoins[.]net.\n\nAccording to Proofpoint visibility, each of the email campaigns has been sent to anywhere\nfrom tens to hundreds of recipients around the globe, and emails from the same campaign\ncontain the same credential pairs—user id and password—for all recipients. It appears that\nmultiple people can log in with the same user id and password if they log in from a different\nIP address and browser. However, once they change the password, as detailed in the next\nsection, and add in a phone number, the account becomes unique, and victims will not see\nany trace of other victims’ activities.\n\n## A Walkthrough of the Scheme\n\nThis cluster of Advance Fee Fraud activity begins like any other type of business email\ncompromise, with an email designed to get the attention of the recipient. The emails all\nappear similar to the one shown in Figure 1, which attempts to lure victims with the promise\nof a hefty amount of money. In this case, that amount is 28.85 Bitcoin or about $1,350,119\nUSD (as of 26 August 2021).\n\n_Figure 1. Sample of the initial email sent to intended victims._\n\n**Step 1 - Logging In**\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce a victim is successfully enticed by the monetary promise in the email, they will be\ntempted to try to log in to the noted Bitcoin wallet website using the provided credentials. The\ncustomer ID and password work to access the site; however, as soon as a victim logs in,\nthey are prompted to change the password and add a recovery phone number for security\n(Figure 2).\n\n_Figure 2. Change password and enable multi-factor authentication prompt._\n\nThis step may be intended to provide a false sense of security to the victim as they could see\nit as a sign of legitimacy given the emphasis on protecting the account via multi-factor\nauthentication, which is considered a security best practice.\n\nOnce the victim follows through with this step, being guided to take over the account, they\nreceive an automated call to the phone number they provided, giving the one-time password\n(OTP) to enable the additional account security. The OTP codes are sent from one of two\nnumbers: +44 2045 383250 (UK number) or +1 (201) 379 6348 (US number).\n\nAfter inputting the OTP, the website confirms the account has been secured as seen in\nFigure 3.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3. Confirmation of account security after the victim has changed the password and_\n_established multi-factor authentication via phone._\n\nTo provide even more reassurance to the victim, the account secured confirmation notes that\nthe only way to get in touch with the platform support service is via the internal messaging\nsystem through the now secured account. Great! Whoever was the owner of the account\nprior to the victim now has no control over it. The victim can now go ahead and try to empty\nthose 28.85 BTC into their wallet.\n\n**Step 2 – Inside the Platform**\n\nNavigating around the account, a victim can find a couple of messages from the alleged\n“previous owner” of the account, Figures 4 through 6.\n\n_Figure 4._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5._\n\n_Figure 6._\n\nThe information provided in the messages indicates that this platform is completely\nanonymous, making it the perfect place to take some BTC from. The user account area\nshows there is no need to enter any name or address. The victim is only allowed to enter a\nphone number and an optional email address. The page also notes the last time the victim\nlogged in and mentions that the IP address is never stored, putting a technically savvy victim\neven more at ease.\n\n**Step 3 – Withdrawing the Funds**\n\nAs depicted in Figure 7, the account shows some BTC has been deposited and withdrawn in\nthe past, making it appear as if the account is functional. Navigating to the “Withdraw” entry\nin the menu a victim can try to transfer some funds out of the platform; however the platform\n\n\n-----\n\nstates that the first transfer out of any portfolio must be 0.0001 BTC (about $4.75 USD as of\n26 August 2021) to ensure everything works as expected from both sender/receiver ends.\n\nAs the victim proceeds and submits a transfer request, the transfer appears in the queue.\nAfter roughly 40 minutes, the transfer option appears to work! The victim starts to receive\nconfirmations of the transfer along with the amount appearing in their personal wallet. The\nplatform also appears to be updated in real time (Figure 7).\n\n_Figure 7._\n\nUnfortunately for the victim, when they try to take out the rest of the BTC they hit a wall\n(Figure 8).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8. Notification that there is a monetary minimum for withdrawal from the account._\n\nIt is at this time that the platform informs the victim that, to help them save money, the\naccount owner specified a minimum withdrawal amount of 29.029 BTC at the time the\naccount was created. Thus, the victim cannot withdraw anything less than that amount. The\nvictim will now likely conclude the only way to get those 28.9999 BTC is by transferring\nenough BTC to the platform (anything greater than 0.0291 BTC) to reach a balance of at\nleast 29.029 BTC, as specified. At that point, the victim will be able to empty the whole\naccount, right?\n\nWrong! While Proofpoint researchers were unable to verify, we assess with high confidence\nthat the final transfer would not work, leaving the victim’s wallet 0.029 BTC lighter. That\namount is almost insignificant compared to the alleged account balance; however, it still\nrepresents about $1400 USD (as of 26 August 2021).\n\n**Additional Platform Functionality**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Bitcoin platform also has a Portfolio section that appears functional and shows previous\nportfolio activity. If a victim were to try to create a portfolio, they would be required to wire at\nleast 0.25 BTC or the equivalent in fiat currency via the “Deposit” section of the site.\nProofpoint researchers only tested the cryptocurrency transfer option, which the platform\nprovided a new BTC address for the transfer of funds and generated a new “invoice” that\nappeared in the dashboard as awaiting payment. While Proofpoint researchers did not follow\nthrough with transferring any cryptocurrency to the platform, we expect that it would have\nbeen a successful transaction.\n\nThere is also an option to convert BTC to fiat and to wire that amount to a victim’s chosen\nbank account. To do so, the victim would have to create a new beneficiary, providing their full\nname, country, and address required, and add that individual’s SWIFT and IBAN number for\npayment. Interestingly, this option appears to be fully functioning with the platform employing\na properly implemented IBAN parsing. Proofpoint researchers first tried entering random\nletters and numbers as IBAN and SWIFT, but that did not work until we provided a real\nSWIFT/IBAN pair.\n\n## An Ever-Evolving Platform\n\nThe platform appears to be under active development. The threat actors in August 2021\nadded an additional step to force prospective victims to pay money upfront before being able\nto log in and access the account. After changing the log in password and setting up multifactor authentication, the victim must agree to a yearly fee of 0.0005 BTC, as seen in Figure\n9.\n\n_Figure 9._\n\n\n-----\n\nProofpoint researchers assess that this change will reduce the chances of this scheme\ncontinuing to be successful because the intended victim is not given the chance to engage\nwith the platform and buy in to its legitimate-appearing features. Accounts whose password\nand phone number have been changed prior to August 5, 2021, however, are still able to\nlogin and use the platform without being requested this additional fee.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nUsing the incentive of monetary gain is always a timely and effective method of tempting\npotential victims into engaging in elaborate Advance Fee Fraud schemes. The reliance on\nrobust interaction by the potential victim, in this instance, may serve as a disincentive but\nalso enables the threat actor to bypass some automated threat detection services. Proofpoint\nresearchers expect the threat actor to continue with this activity and to evolve their tactics in\nfuture campaigns with an eye on increasing their rate of success.\n\n**Indicators of Compromise**\n\n**Indicator** **Description**\n\nquetta@pec[.]org[.]pk Email sender\n\nmarketing@thetenders[.]com Email sender\n\ninfo@kenmascs[.]com Email sender\n\ninfo@coin45[.]com Email sender\n\ninfo@securecoins[.]net Email sender\n\ninquiry@rosaritoindustries[.]com Email sender\n\ncoin45@mail[.]com Email sender\n\ncrypto@adminsupport[.]com Email sender\n\ncryptoadmin@adminsupport[.]com Email sender\n\ncryptoadmin@supportsystem[.]com Email sender\n\n\n-----\n\nadmin1@coin45[.]com Email sender\n\nbitcoinfunds@mail[.]com Email sender\n\nbitcoinadmin@supportsystem[.]com Email sender\n\ncoin1@efeasy[.]cloud Email sender\n\ncoin2@efeasy[.]cloud Email sender\n\ncoins4@efeasy[.]cloud Email sender\n\ncoins5@efeasy[.]cloud Email sender\n\ncoins6@efeasy[.]cloud Email sender\n\ncoins7@efeasy[.]cloud Email sender\n\nadm@onlinemsc[.]xyz Email sender\n\ncoins45@onet[.]eu Email sender\n\nadm1@efeasy[.]cloud Email sender\n\nho@almasroor[.]com Email sender\n\ny.kirimura@nihonplant[.]jp Email sender\n\nm-iwasaki@wtw[.]co[.]jp Email sender\n\nsales@mphgroup[.]uk Email sender\n\nadm@caretis[.]gr Email sender\n\ninfo@mail[.]com Email sender\n\n\n-----\n\n015-0000@mfchmao[.]ru Email sender\n\n0786306834loans@gmail[.]com Email sender\n\n210231@itapemirimcorp[.]com[.]br Email sender\n\nBitcoin@adminsupport[.]com Email sender\n\nChabanova.O@mfua[.]ru Email sender\n\nJohn.Conkle@tempursealy[.]com Email sender\n\na.bellantuono@aslfg[.]it Email sender\n\na.petelin@sct[.]ru Email sender\n\naccount@densen[.]dk Email sender\n\nadmin@nanoptika[.]ru Email sender\n\nalessandra.lara@grupocanopus[.]com[.]br Email sender\n\nalthuis@huissier-justice[.]fr Email sender\n\naoperry925@gmail[.]com Email sender\n\nasapreps1.uce.report@gmail[.]com Email sender\n\nbarclays.payout@gmail[.]com Email sender\n\nbitcoin@adminsupport[.]com Email sender\n\nbitcoin@support[.]com Email sender\n\nchernichenko_av@krsk[.]irgups[.]ru Email sender\n\n\n-----\n\ncs1.nissan.snp@grupocanopus[.]com[.]br Email sender\n\ndanny.trom@ehess[.]fr Email sender\n\ndavide@barbanoarredamenti[.]it Email sender\n\ndimvagia@otenet[.]gr Email sender\n\ne.skalova@mercedes-kanavto[.]ru Email sender\n\neloglogs@palletsolutions[.]ca Email sender\n\neshayko@guit[.]omskportal[.]ru Email sender\n\nfabio.dattanasio@tbsit[.]com Email sender\n\nfaithkingsley@vivaldi[.]net Email sender\n\ngaliullin.r@mercedes-kanavto[.]ru Email sender\n\ngeorge@sunrisehouse[.]com Email sender\n\ninfo@ig-conseil[.]com Email sender\n\nk.iwakabe@nde[.]co[.]jp Email sender\n\nkst91178@gmail[.]com Email sender\n\nmamedova.nn@ocsial[.]com Email sender\n\nno-reply@kgsha[.]ru Email sender\n\nno-reply@mail[.]com Email sender\n\nno-reply@oaed[.]gr Email sender\n\n\n-----\n\nnoreply@marketleader[.]com Email sender\n\nnoreply@techradarportal[.]se Email sender\n\no.dorodniaia@sct[.]ru Email sender\n\nottt33754@gmail[.]com Email sender\n\noyu.kocheva@vtc-service[.]ru Email sender\n\nphilip.stephenson@oracle[.]com Email sender\n\npope@mail[.]com Email sender\n\nregina@urosa[.]com Email sender\n\nrosaj@remax-alliance-houston-tx[.]com Email sender\n\nrosangelab@hc[.]ufu[.]br Email sender\n\nsergio.abreu@scml[.]pt Email sender\n\nsmtpfox-ucvhy@crismedina[.]com[.]br Email sender\n\nyangjiang@cmagency[.]com[.]cn Email sender\n\nbc1qtrle8939dcu39hqfh0jt0y25d4wxqvt60f7pj8 Platform’s Bitcoin sending address\n\n1ApdtuAoGvDi8BLK9CaZFSw8Ku9go6Mwdb Platform’s Bitcoin sending address\n\nsecurecoins[.]net Campaign landing page\n\ncoins45[.]com Campaign landing page\n\ncoinmace[.]net Campaign landing page\n\n\n-----\n\ncoinomac[.]com Campaign landing page\n\nfortcoin[.]net Campaign landing page\n\nSubscribe to the Proofpoint Blog\n\n\n-----",
