During the examination, our analysts extracted and studied a malicious sample, which\nturned out to be one of the backdoors used by the hacker group known as Winnti.\n\nWe already came across the malware Winnti uses when we studied the ShadowPad backdoor\nsamples that we found in the compromised network of a state institution in Kyrgyzstan. In\naddition, earlier in the same network, we found another specialized backdoor called PlugX,\nwhich has many intersections with ShadowPad in the code and network infrastructure. A\n[separate material was devoted to the comparative analysis of both families.](https://news.drweb.com/show/?lng=en&i=14048)\n\nIn this study, we analyze the uncovered malicious module, explore its algorithms and features,\nand define its connection with other well-known tools of the Winnti APT group.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Main features\n\nOn the infected device, the malicious module was located in the system directory C:\n```\n\\Windows\\System32 as oci.dll. Thus, the module was prepared for launch by the MSDTC\n\n```\n(Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator) system service using the DLL Hijacking method.\nAccording to our data, the file got to the computers in May 2020, but the method of initial\ninfection remains unknown. The Event Log contained records of the creation of services designed\nto start and stop MSDTC, as well as for the backdoor execution.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe also found traces of other services running that had random names. Their files were located\nin directories like C:\\Windows\\Temp\\<random1>\\<random2>, where random1 and\n```\nrandom2 are strings of random length and random Latin characters. At the time of the study,\n\n```\nthese services’ executable files were missing.\n\nAn interesting find was a service that indicates the use of a smbexec.py utility for remote code\n[execution from the Impacket set. The attackers used this tool to establish remote access to the](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket)\ncommand shell in a semi-interactive mode.\n\nThe studied malicious sample was added to the Dr.Web virus database as BackDoor.Spyder.1.\nIn one of the discovered Spyder samples, the debug logging functions and messages remained.\nMessages used when communicating with the C&C server contained the string \"Spyder\".\n\n\n-----\n\nThe backdoor is notable for a number of interesting features. First, oci.dll contains the main\nPE module, but with missing file signatures. Erasing the header signatures was presumably done\nto obstruct the backdoor detection in the device's memory. Secondly, the payload itself does\nnot carry malicious functionality, but serves to load and coordinate additional plug-ins received\nfrom the С&С server. With these plug-ins, the backdoor performs its main tasks. Therefore, this\nfamily has a modular structure, just like the other backdoor families used by Winnti — the\npreviously mentioned ShadowPad and PlugX.\n\nAnalysis of Spyder's network infrastructure revealed a link to other Winnti attacks. In particular,\nthe infrastructure used by the Crosswalk and ShadowPad backdoors described in the Positive\n[Technologies study corresponds with some of the Spyder samples. The graph below clearly](https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/analytics/pt-esc-threat-intelligence/higaisa-or-winnti-apt-41-backdoors-old-and-new/)\nshows the identified intersections.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe analyzed sample of BackDoor.Spyder.1 is notable primarily because its code does not\nperform direct malicious functions. Its main tasks are to covertly operate within the infected\nsystem and establish communication with the control server and then wait for operator\ncommands. At the same time, it has a modular structure that allows the operator to scale its\ncapabilities, providing any functionality depending on the needs of the attackers. The plug-ins\nmake the considered sample similar to ShadowPad and PlugX, which, together with the\nintersections in their network infrastructures, allows us to conclude that it is used by Winnti.\n\n### BackDoor.Spyder.1 operating routine\n\nA backdoor written in C++ and designed to run on 64-bit Microsoft Windows operating\nsystems. It is used for targeted attacks on information systems, collecting information about an\ninfected device, loading functional malicious modules, coordinating their work, and providing\ncommunication with the C&C server. In the infected system, it exists as a DLL file and is loaded\nby the system service using the DLL Hijacking method. After injection, it functions in the\ncomputer's RAM.\n\nThe backdoor is a malicious DLL file. The function names in its export table duplicate the\nexported functions of the apphelp.dll system library.\n\n\n-----\n\nOn the infected computer, the backdoor file was located in C:\\Windows\\System32\\oci.dll\ncatalog. The file’s original name from the export table is dll. It was loaded by the MSDTC\nsystem service using the DLL Hijacking method (Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator\nService).\n\nFrom a functional point of view, the sample is a loader for the main payload, which is stored in\nthe .data section as a DLL, with some elements of the DOS and PE headers equal to zero.\n\n\n-----\n\n**The loader operation**\n\nLoading is performed in a function designated as malmain_3 and called from the DLL entry\npoint via two transitional functions.\n\nFirst, the header signatures are checked. If they are not standard, the ERROR_BAD_EXE_FORMAT\nerror value is set; however, this action does not affect the loader operation in any way.\n\nThe memory for the image is then allocated according to the\n```\nIMAGE_NT_HEADERS64.OptionalHeader.SizeOfImage value, and the loader_struc\n\n```\nauxiliary structure is formed.\n```\nstruct loader_struc\n{\n IMAGE_NT_HEADERS64 *pPE_header;\n LPVOID ImageBase;\n HMODULE *p_imported_modules\n QWORD number_of_imported_modules\n HMODULE (__stdcall *pLoadLibrary)(LPCSTR lpLibFileName);\n FARPROC (__stdcall *pGetProcAddress)(HMODULE hModule, LPCSTR lpProcName);\n BOOL (__stdcall *pFreeLibrary)(HMODULE hLibModule);\n QWORD unk;\n};\n\n```\nThis is followed by the standard process of loading the PE module into memory and calling the\nloaded module's entry point (DllMain) with the DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH argument, and after\nexiting it, calling it again with DLL_PROCESS_DETACH.\n\n**The main module operation**\n\nIn the main module, the values of all signatures required for the correct file loading are equal to\nzero.\n\n- IMAGE_DOS_HEADER.e_magic\n\n- IMAGE_NT_HEADERS64.Signature\n\n\n-----\n\n- IMAGE_NT_HEADERS64.FileHeader.Magic\n\nIn addition, TimeDateStamp and section names also have a null value. The remaining values\nare correct, thus after manually editing the necessary signatures, the file can be downloaded for\nanalysis as a proper PE module.\n\nThe analysis of the main module is complicated, since atypical methods of calling functions are\n[periodically used. The UT hash library is used for storing and processing structures. It allows one](https://github.com/troydhanson/uthash)\nto convert standard C structures to hash tables by adding a single member of the\n```\nut_hash_handle type. All library functions, such as adding elements, search, delete, etc., are\n\n```\nimplemented as macros, which leads them to be forcibly inlined by the compiler in the code of\nthe main (calling) function.\n\n[The mbedtls library is used to interact with the C&C server.](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbedtls)\n\n**DllMain function**\n\nAt the beginning of execution, the Global\\\\BFE_Notify_Event_{65a097fe-6102```\n446a-9f9c-55dfc3f45853}, event, execution mode (from the configuration), and the\n\n```\ncommand line are checked, then the operating threads are started.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe module has an embedded configuration with the following structure:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe hash field contains a value that can be an identifier. This value is used when communicating\nwith the C&C server and can be represented as a\n```\nb2e4936936c910319fb3d210bfa55b18765db9cc string, which is the same length as the\n\n```\nSHA1 hashes.\n\nThe string field contains a single character string: 1.\n```\nCA_cert is a certificate of the certificate authority in the DER format. It is used to establish a\n\n```\nconnection to the C&C server over the TLS 1.2 protocol.\n\n\n-----\n\nCertificate information can be found in the Addendum No. 1 to the study.\n\nThe DllMain function enables for the creation of multiple operating threads depending on a\nnumber of conditions.\n\n- Main thread — thread_1_main\n\n- New server request thread — thread_2_get_new_C2_start_communication\n\n- Encrypted module execution thread — thread_4_execute_encrypted_module\n\nFor execution, the value of the builtin_config.exec_mode parameter must be non-zero.\n\n- If the builtin_config.exec_mode value is 1 or 2, and the process command line\ncontains the -k netsvcs substring, the main thread and the thread for getting the new C&C\nserver address are started;\n\n- If builtin_config.exec_mode is equal to 2, a thread that decrypts and runs the module\nstored in the system is started;\n\n- If the value is 3, the main thread and the thread for getting the new C&C server address are\nstarted.\n\nIn the examined sample, the value of the exec_mode parameter is 3.\n\n**The main thread**\n\nFirst, the backdoor checks the OS version then prepares a structure for initializing functions and a\nstructure for storing a certain configuration fields. The procedure looks artificially complicated.\n\n\n-----\n\n3 pointers to functions are inserted to the funcs_struc structure of the funcs_1 type that\nwill be called in turn inside the init_global_funcs_and_allocated_cfg function.\n\nIn the set_global_funcs_by_callbacks function, each initializer function is called in turn.\n\nThe general order of structure forming is as follows:\n\n1) Two structures are passed to each function: the first contains pointers to some functions; the\nsecond is empty.\n\n2) Each function transfers function pointers from one structure to another.\n\n3) After calling the initializer function, the function pointers are moved from the local structure\nto the global array of structures at a certain index.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs a result, after all the unusual transformations, a certain number of global structures that are\ncombined into a single array remain.\n\nUltimately, the function call can be represented as follows.\n\nThe use of complex transformations like copying local structures with functions and transferring\nthem to global structures is probably intended to complicate the analysis of a malicious sample.\n\nThe backdoor then uses the UT hash library to generate a hash table of service structures\nresponsible for storing the network connection context, connection parameters, etc.\n\nBelow is the fragment of the hash table generation code.\n\nIt is worth noting that the hash table contains a signature value that allows one to determine the\nlibrary used: g_p_struc_10->hh.tbl->signature = 0xA0111FE1;.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe backdoor in question is characterized by the distribution of relevant fields and data across\nseveral structures created specifically for this purpose. This feature makes it difficult to create\nmeaningful names for structures during analysis.\n\nAfter the preparatory steps, the backdoor proceeds to initialize the connection to the C&C\nserver.\n\n**Initializing the connection to the C&C server**\n\nIt is noteworthy that the program code associated with the network connection contains its own\nerror codes, in addition to the codes from the mbedtls library.\n\nA list of error codes found in the sample.\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter a series of preparatory actions, the backdoor resolves the address of the C&C server stored\nin the configuration and retrieves the port. Addresses in the configuration are stored as strings:\n```\nkoran.junlper[.]com:80 and koran.junlper[.]com:443. Next, the program creates a\n\n```\nTCP socket for the connection. After that, it creates a context for the secure connection and\nperforms a TLS handshake.\n\nAfter establishing secure connection, the backdoor expects a packet with a command from the\nC&C server. The program works with two packet formats:\n\n1. The packet received after processing the TLS protocol is a \"transport\" packet.\n\n2. The packet received after processing the transport packet is a \"data\" packet. It contains the\ncommand ID and additional data.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe transport packet header is represented by the following structure.\n```\nstruct transport_packet_header\n{\n DWORD signature;\n WORD compressed_len;\n WORD uncompressed_len;\n};\n\n```\nThe data is placed after the header and packed by the LZ4 algorithm. The backdoor checks the\nvalue of the signature field. It must be equal to 0x573F0A68.\n\nAfter unpacking, the resulting data packet has a header in the following format.\n```\nstruct data_packet_header\n{\n WORD tag;\n WORD id;\n WORD unk_0;\n BYTE update_data;\n BYTE id_part;\n DWORD unk_1;\n DWORD unk_2;\n DWORD len;\n};\n\n```\nThe tag and id fields together define the backdoor action, which means they denote the\ncommand ID.\n\nThese header structures are used in both directions of interaction.\n\nThe order of processing server commands:\n\n1. Client verification\n\n2. Sending the information about the infected system\n\n3. Processing commands by IDs\n\nThere is a variable that stores the state of the dialog in the structure responsible for\ncommunicating with the C&C server. Therefore, before directly executing commands, performing\nthe first two steps is required, which can be considered as a second handshake.\n\n**A verification step**\n\nTo perform the verification step, the values of the tag and id fields in the primary packet\nreceived from the C&C server must be equal to 1.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe verification process is as follows:\n\n1. The backdoor forms a buffer from an 8-byte array that follows the packet header and the\nhash_id field taken from the configuration. The result can be represented as the structure:\n```\n  struct buff\n  {\n    BYTE packet_data[8];\n    BYTE hash_id[20];\n  }\n\n```\n2. The SHA1 hash of the data in the resulting buffer is calculated. The result is placed in the\npacket (after the header) and sent to the server.\n\n**Sending system information**\n\nThe next packet received from the C&C server must have the tag value equal to 5 and id value\nequal to 3. The system data is formed as a sysinfo_packet_data structure.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe sysinfo_packet_data.id field contains a 0x19C0001 constant.\n\nThe sysinfo_packet_data.block_1.bot_id value is extracted from the registry. The\nbackdoor locates it in the instance parameter of the\n```\nSOFTWARE\\Clients\\Mail\\Hotmail\\backup key, which, in turn, depending on the\n\n```\nprivileges, can be located in the HKLM or HKCU sections.\n\nIf the value is missing, a random GUID is generated using UuidCreate, then formatted as a\n```\nXXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXX string and saved. If the ID already existed, the\nsysinfo_packet_data.block_1.bot_id_created parameter is assigned the 1 value. If\n\n```\nthe ID was created, the parameter is assigned the 2 value.\n\nThe sysinfo_packet_data.block_1.cpu_arch parameter value:\n\n- 1 — x86\n\n- 2 — x64\n\nThe process of determining the MAC address and IP address values by the backdoor is\nnoteworthy. First, the program searches for the network interface through which the largest\nnumber of packets passed, then gets its MAC address and searches for the IP address of this\ninterface.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe OS version is encoded with a value from 1 to 13 (0 if an error occurs, starting with 5.0 and\nthen ascending the version.\n\nThe sysinfo_packet_data.block_1.cfg_string field contains the string value from\nthe backdoor configuration, which is equal to the character 1.\n\n**Processing commands**\n\nAfter the verification step and sending the system information, BackDoor.Spyder.1 begins\nprocessing the main commands. Unlike most backdoors, whose commands are quite specific\n(pick up a file, create a process, etc.), in this instance, they are more of a service nature and\nrepresent instructions for storing and structuring the received data. In fact, all these service\n\n\n-----\n\ncommands are aimed at loading new modules in PE format, storing them, and calling certain\nexported functions. It is worth noting that the modules and their information are stored in\nmemory in the form of hash tables using UT-hash.\n\n**tag** **id** **Description**\n\n6 1 Send the number of received modules to the server.\n\n2 Save the parameters of the received module in memory.\n\n3 Save the body of the module in the memory.\n\n4 Load a previously saved module. The search is performed in the hash table by the\nID obtained from the packet with the command. The module is loaded into\nmemory, its entry point is called, then the addresses of the 4 exported functions\nare obtained, which are stored in the structure for further call. Call the exported\nfunction No. 1.\n\n5 Call the exported function No. 4 of one of the loaded modules, then unload it.\n\n6 Send in response a packet consisting only of the data_packet_header header,\nin which the unk_2 field is 0xFFFFFFFF.\n\n7 Call the exported function No. 2 of one of the loaded modules.\n\n8 Call the exported function No. 3 of one of the loaded modules.\n\n5 2 Send information about the current connection parameters to the server.\n\n4 - Presumably, the exported function No. 1 can return a table of pointers to\nfunctions, and the program calls one of these functions at this command.\n\nAfter processing each packet received from the server, the backdoor checks the difference\nbetween the two values of the GetTickCount result. If the value exceeds the specified\nreference value, it sends the 0x573F0A68 signature value to the server without any additional\ndata and transformations.\n\n|tag|id|Description|\n|---|---|---|\n|6|1|Send the number of received modules to the server.|\n||2|Save the parameters of the received module in memory.|\n||3|Save the body of the module in the memory.|\n||4|Load a previously saved module.

To request this URL, the program can use both the system proxy\nand the HTTP proxy provided in the configuration. The request is made using the\n```\nInternetOpenUrlA WinHTTP API.\n\n```\nThe response must be a Base64-encoded string between two markers: DZKS and DZJS. It\nshould be noted that a similar algorithm and markers were used in the PlugX family\n[(BackDoor.PlugX.28, BackDoor.PlugX.38).](https://vms.drweb.com/virus/?i=21507745&lng=en)\n\nThe decoded string is decompressed using the RtlDecompressBuffer function, resulting in\nthe address of the new C&C server and the port to connect to.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Encrypted module execution thread**\n\nIf the exec_mode configuration parameter is set to 2 and the command line contains -k\n```\nnetsvcs, the backdoor creates a separate thread to execute the module stored in the file.\n\n```\nTo do this, the backdoor searches for the C:\\Windows\\System32\\1.update file at first. If\nsuch a file exists, the program reads it and decrypts it.\n\nThis file contains the path to an encrypted file containing a DLL module that the backdoor reads,\ndecrypts, and loads.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Features of the x86 version\n\nThe version of the backdoor designed to run on 32-bit Microsoft Windows operating systems is\ndetected by Dr.Web as a BackDoor.Spyder.3 (83e47dbe20882513dfd1453c4fcfd99d3bcecc3d).\nThe main difference of this modification is the presence of debug messages. The list of debug\nmessages can be found in the Addendum No 2 to the study.\n\nMessages are recorded on the log file located in the %WINDIR%\\temp\\deskcpl.ttf\ndirectory. Depending on the initialization parameters, they can be output using\n```\nOutputDebufStringA or encrypted using a simple XOR operation with byte 0x62.\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nMessages related to communication with the C&C server and command processing are output\nusing the OutputDebugStringA function. It is noteworthy that for such messages, the\n```\n[Spyder] prefix is used.\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n### Addendum No. 1 CA_cert information (certificate for establishing a connection with the C&C server)\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n### Addendum No. 2.
