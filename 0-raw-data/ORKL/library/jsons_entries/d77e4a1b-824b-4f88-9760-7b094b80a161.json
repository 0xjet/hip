Yet in terms of ambition and intention, CRASHOVERRIDE sought to attain greater and more\nserious impacts than 2015. Based on analysis of the various payloads, CRASHOVERRIDE attempted\nto create a far more widespread outage than 2015 and stage a potential destructive event as the final\nstep in the attack sequence. Despite seemingly thorough analysis of CRASHOVERRIDE, including\nin public presentations at events such as Black Hat,[5] significant implications behind the event –\nespecially its intended scope and potential outcome – remain largely ignored.\n\nIn this paper, we will explore the CRASHOVERRIDE event from a different perspective. Instead of\nlooking at what happened at Ukrenergo station “North” in December 2016 following\nCRASHOVERRIDE’s execution, we will explore what the attackers, identified as ELECTRUM,[6] likely\nsought to achieve given the design and configuration of software deployed in the victim environment.\nAttackers made many mistakes in designing and deploying CRASHOVERRIDE and related impact\nmodules. However the scope and implications for this attack’s intentions are cause for deep concern\namong electric utility operators. By exploring and understanding what CRASHOVERRIDE tried but\nultimately failed to achieve, relevant ICS asset owners and operators can prepare for better\ninstrumented and executed future attacks and prevent potentially destructive results.\n\n# CRASHOVERRIDE in Review\n\nSeveral sources have reviewed the CRASHOVERRIDE event: from malware-focused analysis on the\nmodular ICS-manipulating framework[7] to an overview of the intrusion lifecycle leading up to\n\n1 **[CRASHOVERRIDE: Analysis of the Threat to Electric Grid Operations – Dragos; Anatomy of an Attack:](https://dragos.com/wp-content/uploads/CrashOverride-01.pdf)**\n**[Detecting and Defeating CRASHOVERRIDE – Joe Slowik, Dragos (Virus Bulletin 2018)](https://www.virusbulletin.com/uploads/pdf/magazine/2018/VB2018-Slowik.pdf)**\n2 **[Win32/Industroyer: A New Threat for Industrial Control Systems – Anton Cherepanov, ESET](https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Win32_Industroyer.pdf)**\n3 **[Industroyer: Biggest Threat to Industrial Control Systems since Stuxnet – Anton Cherepanov and Robert](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/06/12/industroyer-biggest-threat-industrial-control-systems-since-stuxnet/)**\nLipovsky, ESET\n4 **[Ukraine’s Power Outage was a Cyber Attack: Ukrenergo – Pavel Polityuk, Oleg Vukmanovic, Stephen](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-cyber-attack-energy-idUSKBN1521BA)**\n[Jewkes, Reuters; The Ukrainian Power Grid was Hacked Again – Kim Zetter, Motherboard; Analysis of the](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/bmvkn4/ukrainian-power-station-hacking-december-2016-report)\n**[Cyber Attack on the Ukrainian Power Grid – Robert M.

Each of these reports and their analyses largely focus on observed\nitems following events at substation “North” in Ukrenergo. Although hewing to observed events, such\nanalysis neglects significant aspects of what the attacker likely sought to achieve in this attack but\nfailed to successfully execute.\n\n**_Figure 1: CRASHOVERRIDE Event Attack Flow_**\n\nCRASHOVERRIDE impacted electric transmission operations resulting in an outage of approximately\nan hour in Kiev, Ukraine – noticeably smaller in both scale and duration than the 2015 attack.[9] While\nthe 2015 event took place through manual manipulation of systems via compromised remote logons\nto control system workstations, the 2016 event leveraged the CRASHOVERRIDE framework to\nencode ICS manipulation within software. This aspect represents a significant development in\nattacker tradecraft. Encoding ICS attacks in software enables the attack to scale far better than\nmanual system interaction. Reviewing log data and other artifacts associated with the\nCRASHOVERRIDE event revealed that the intended scale of the attack was far larger than 2015 but\nalso significantly different from what attackers ultimately achieved.\n\nCRASHOVERRIDE targeted electric transmission control systems across multiple communication\nprotocols – IEC-101,[10] IEC-104,[11] IEC-61850,[12] and OPC-DA[13] – with a very simple yet effective\nobjective: to change the physical state of breakers and related equipment from “closed” (allowing\npower to flow) to “open.” There is some variation in effects in CRASHOVERRIDE. Options exist for a\ndirect state change to the flow of power or for “strobing,” meaning continuously switching between\n\n8 **[Anatomy of an Attack: Detecting and Defeating CRASHOVERRIDE – Joe Slowik, Dragos (Virus Bulletin](https://www.virusbulletin.com/uploads/pdf/magazine/2018/VB2018-Slowik.pdf)**\n2018).

However, only immediate “open” and “close” effects appear to have been\nused in the victim’s environment.\n\nWhile seemingly a simple “on-off” switch in functionality, the implementation of these standards\nrequires more than a direct, one-step shift from one logical state to another for successful\ncommunication and state alteration. Achieving actual physical manipulation of the targeted RTU or\nother system requires logical messaging following discrete, required steps. An accurate\nunderstanding of the specific protocol targeted – as well as the vendor’s actual implementation of the\nprotocol – requires knowing the “statefulness” of a given protocol’s communications for proper\ninteraction.[14]\n\nComputer science includes a notion of statefulness for programming and communication, where\nprotocols can either be stateful or stateless. Stateful protocols are designed to record or consider\npreceding events in the communication stream, while stateless events can ignore or need not\nconsider such items.[15] As an example, TCP with its handshake and session management represents\na stateful protocol, whereas UDP streams are stateless in nature.\n\nCRASHOVERRIDE’s functionality is based on a semi-modular construct where different effects\nmodules perform protocol-specific communications, usually executed from a common launcher.\nBased on the implementation of CRASHOVERRIDE’s effects modules, the developers were either\nunaware of or failed to properly implement appropriate stateful communications in their software for\nspecific ICS communication protocols. Although potentially indicative of either poor testing or\nunderstanding of the targeted systems and underlying protocols, such errors are hardly rare or unique\ngiven complex systems and varying vendor implementations of more general protocol standards.[16]\nOne possibility for this error may be test environment. Protocol emulators in software, such as the\npublicly-available IEC Server project,[17] do not enforce statefulness and associated communication\ntimeouts. Physical hardware will employ such items in line with the vendor-specific implementations\nof the relevant communication standard. As a result of either equipment limitations, error, or sheer\nignorance, the actual receiving system in the victim environment of CRASHOVERRIDE’s execution\nwould either reject the communication as invalid given improper implementation of stateful standards,\nor ignore for similar reasons. The impact (or lack of effect) can be compared to an invalid TCP\nhandshake with the resulting absence of actual communication.\n\nThis aspect of CRASHOVERRIDE is important. When reviewing intended targeting within the victim\nenvironment, the number of control systems identified for manipulation is large and more widespread\nthan the actual outage. Based on available data from the event, at least seven OPC servers with\nmultiple managed OPC instances each were targeted along with at least eight IEC-101 controllers\nand over 400 control points for IEC-104 communication.[18] Additionally, all observed instances of the\nIEC-61850 attack module swept the local subnet for applicable hosts and attempted to disrupt based\n\n14 **[Stateful Protocol Hunting: What It IS, Why It Matters, How to Do It – Dan Gunter and Dan Michaud-Soucy,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTczBtb2ReU)**\nDragos (CS3STHLM 2018)\n15 **[Protocol State – Information and Communications Security (Google Books); “Program State” – Dictionary](https://books.google.com/books?id=oCyqpdVVtfwC&lpg=PA89&dq=%22stateless%20protocol%22&pg=PA89#v=onepage&q=%22stateless%20protocol%22&f=false)**\nof Computer Science, Engineering, and Technology (Google Books)\n16 **[Analyzing Operational Behavior of Stateful Protocol Implementations for Detecting Semantic Bugs –](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8023160)**\nEndadul Hoque, Omar Chowdhury, Sze Yiu Chau, Critina Nita-Rotaru, and Ninghui Li, 47[th] Annual IEEE/IFIP\nInternational Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (2017)\n17 **[IEC Server – jkl (Sourceforge)](https://sourceforge.net/p/iecserver/wiki/Home/)**\n18 Cited figures based on non-public sources and incident artifacts made available to Dragos for analysis in 2018.\n\n_©2019 Dragos, Inc.

Based on this information and targeting intention, CRASHOVERRIDE attempted a\nwidespread outage across hundreds of individual control systems, aiming for a disruptive impact that\nwould be orders of magnitude larger than the 2015 event.\n\nEssentially: ELECTRUM attempted to manipulate many systems via CRASHOVERRIDE to create a\nwidespread electric transmission disruption. Yet across all four protocols and all related systems\ninvolved in controlling operations, the effect was relatively minimal in terms of actual outage and\nquickly restored due to Ukrenergo’s ability to manually reclose impacted breakers. While ambitious in\nscope and reach, CRASHOVERRIDE’s actual impact can be judged as a failure.\n\nYet simply stopping at ELECTRUM’s failure to successfully execute a widespread transmission\ninterruption obscures several interesting elements following attempted disruption operations. Similar\nto the 2015 incident, CRASHOVERRIDE deployed a wiper module to impede recovery and (in this\nspecific case) delete configuration and related files to hamper restoration on infected SCADA\nsystems. This portion of the attack appears to have executed successfully, and produced a situation\nwhere operators lost control and view over ICS operations in the environment. This is a non-trivial\nimpact as it limits the flexibility of remote operations and coordination, while potentially masking subtle\nissues in the transmission environment given loss of remote view into operations.\n\nThe above wiper impact was then followed by an interesting action that was largely overlooked in\ninitial analysis: an attempted denial of service attack using a publicly-known vulnerability on four\nSiemens SIPROTEC protective relays in the operating environment. At this point, ELECTRUM’s\nattack sequence sought to de-energize transmission equipment, create a loss of control and loss of\nview impact on SCADA systems controlling this equipment, and then aimed to remove relay protection\non the de-energized transmission lines. Given Ukrenergo’s ability and willingness to resort to manual\nrestoration operations, absent complete view into the ICS environment’s state, CRASHOVERRIDE\nescalates from an immediate disruption of electric transmission to creating a potentially unstable or\nunsafe system state at time of manual service restoration. To analyze and understand this aspect of\nthe 2016 Ukraine event and its significance, one must understand protective relays and their role in\nelectric operations.\n\n# Protective Relays in Electric Utility Operations\n\nProtective relays play a vital role in electric utility operations. Protective relays use advanced\nalgorithms to protect transmission or generation equipment from harmful conditions. Ultimately, “the\nfunction of protective relaying is to cause the prompt removal from service of any element of a power\nsystem when it suffers a short circuit, or when it starts to operate in any abnormal manner that might\ncause damage or otherwise interfere with the effective operation of the rest of the system.”[19] Relay\nlocations are highlighted in the below diagram (Figure 2), relative to locations in electric generation,\ntransmission, and distribution operations.\n\n19 **[The Art & Science of Protective Relaying – C.

Modern digital protective relay systems perform a variety of diagnostic and\nmonitoring functions to make this possible. They identify items from current to voltage to frequency\nand safeguard electric systems from anomalous, potentially destructive behavior, while providing\noutput and feedback to end users. A high-level overview of such activity is shown in Figure 3. Key to\ndigital relays is the ability to perform precisely the right action within incredibly small time increments\nto preserve the integrity of the protected system.[20]\n\n20 **[Millisecond, Microsecond, Nanosecond: What Can We Do with More Precise Time? - Edmund O.](https://cdn.selinc.com/assets/Literature/Publications/Technical%20Papers/6712_MillisecondMicrosecond_EOS_20160208_Web2.pdf?v=20170706-211233)**\nSchweitzer, III, David E.

Specific relay technology exists\nfor both electric transmission (where relays protect and normalize the flow of electricity to transformers\nand related equipment)[23] and generation (where relays prevent potential swings in several factors,\nincluding rotation frequency).[24] Examples of protective relay applications include phase distance\nprotection for generating assets; initiating protection in event of breaker failure; transformer and\ntransmission system coordination to protect against overcurrent conditions; and protecting generator\nassets against frequency abnormalities.[25]\n\nCoordination among protected assets and grid components is necessary to ensure system-wide\nstability in light of individual site protection actions.[26] While protective relays work to isolate\ntransmission or generation from damage, such automated responses during times of electric system\nstress or distributed disruption can create positive-feedback loops resulting in widespread\ndislocation.[27] In these extreme circumstances, widespread impacts are possible, such as the USCanada 2003 power event and the Italian blackout of 2003, irrespective of grid protection\n\n21 **[What is a Protection Relay – Littelfuse](https://www.littelfuse.com/products/protection-relays-and-controls/protection-relays/protection-relay-pages/what-is-a-protection-relay.aspx)**\n22 **[Digital Protection for Power Systems – A.

Had\nrelays functioned properly, the faulted line would have been isolated and de-energized, preserving\nthe functionality of the rest of the substation. Ultimately, when properly controlled and implemented,\nprotective relays ensure electric service stability and protect physical assets from a variety of natural\nor unnatural fluctuations.\n\n# Post-CRASHOVERRIDE Effects\n\nAfter interrupting the flow of electricity in the victim environment, CRASHOVERRIDE proceeds to a\ncombination loss of visibility- and loss of control-directed disruption. This is illustrated in Figure 4.\n\n**_Figure 4: CRASHOVERRIDE Post-Disruption Effects_**\n\nAt first glance, the impact of the above sequence of events is felt primarily by service restoration and\nrecovery – manipulating SCADA/DCS devices to inhibit reboot and control and deleting configuration\n\n28 **[Relay Performance During Major System Disturbances – Demetrios Tziouvaras (Schweitzer Engineering](https://cdn.selinc.com/assets/Literature/Publications/Technical%20Papers/6244_RelayPerformance_DT_20060914_Web.pdf?v=20160503-225618)**\n[Laboratories); Final Report on the August 14, 2003 Blackout in the United States and Canada: Causes](https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/oeprod/DocumentsandMedia/BlackoutFinal-Web.pdf)\n**[and Recommendations – US-Canada Power System Outage Task Force; Final Report of the Investigation](https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/oeprod/DocumentsandMedia/BlackoutFinal-Web.pdf)**\n**[Committee on the 28 September 2003 Blackout in Italy – UCTE](https://www.entsoe.eu/fileadmin/user_upload/_library/publications/ce/otherreports/20040427_UCTE_IC_Final_report.pdf)**\n29 **[ConEd: Failed Relay Systems, not Transmission Equipment, Caused NYC Blackout – UtilityDive;](https://www.utilitydive.com/news/coned-failed-relay-systems-not-transmission-equipment-caused-nyc-blackou/558830/)**\n**[ConEd Starts to Shed Light on Why NYC Got Plunged Into the Dark – Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-07-15/after-times-square-goes-dark-nyc-s-coned-faces-more-heat)**\n30 **[ConEd Ties NYC Blackout to Bad Wiring Job Done 11 Years Ago – Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-07-29/coned-ties-nyc-blackout-to-a-bad-wiring-job-done-11-years-ago)**\n\n_©2019 Dragos, Inc.

This series of events is non-trivial and tremendously disruptive, but as\nindicated by Ukrainian response to the 2015 event, asset owners can and showed a willingness to\nquickly move into manual system operations at impacted sites in order to restore impacted services\nas quickly as possible. What sets the 2016 event apart in intention – if not in actual impact – was the\nfar-larger scale of disruption designed in the CRASHOVERRIDE effects modules, which as previously\ndescribed aimed to cause a very large-scale interruption in transmission services across hundreds of\ndevices.\n\nThe above widespread impact alone makes manual service restoration (in a scenario where the attack\nsucceeds as designed) difficult given the number of devices manipulated. Yet this is only a half-way\npoint in the overall attack logic, as the last stage of the sequence of events – functionally disabling the\nSIPROTEC protective relays – is most interesting from both an operational and attack impact\nassessment. In terms of attack progression, attackers performed a denial of service (DoS) against\nprotective relays _after_ opening system breakers and removing operator visibility into system\noperations through the wiper attack. Removing protection from an unenergized line at first seems\nnonsensical as, at this stage, there is nothing to actually protect. But the real focus of impact instead\nhinges on a combination of widespread transmission disruption combined with an assumption based\non previous observation of Ukrainian restoration operations that finds asset owners would move to\nrestore service as quickly as possible through manual means despite loss of visibility into actual\nsystem status.\n\nAttacking protective relays can quickly cause severe consequences including “islanding” events\nrelated to grid self-protection actions and the potential for equipment damage due to faults absent\nprotection.[31] However, it appears ELECTRUM in the CRASHOVERRIDE scenario (as designed)\naimed to create an unsafe, unstable condition for reconnected transmission lines at the moment of\nphysical restoration. In this scenario, manually closing breakers opens up the possibility of overcurrent\nscenarios absent digital protection. The vulnerability targeted in the DoS executable, CVE-2015-5374,\nperforms a functional DoS as opposed to a network accessibility DoS.[32] Given these conditions,\nCRASHOVERRIDE evolves from an immediate disruption event to a delayed potential physical\ndestruction attack. As shown in Figure 5, the disruption of transmission through remote terminal unit\n(RTU) manipulation is a precursor to a final, more serious stage: inhibiting protection systems so when\nservice is restored, the target circuit is no longer safe and is subject to damage.\n\n31 **[Anti-Islanding and Smart Grid Protection – Stephen Evanczuk (Digi-Key Electronics)](https://www.digikey.com/en/articles/techzone/2015/jun/anti-islanding-and-smart-grid-protection)**\n32 **[Advisory ICSA-15-202-01 Siemens SIPROTEC Denial-of-Service Vulnerability – US-CERT](https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/advisories/ICSA-15-202-01)**\n\n_©2019 Dragos, Inc.

The effect\ntriggered is practical and useful in legitimate firmware update instances given the limited resources\navailable to legacy SIPROTEC devices (especially for memory). However, when activated, the\nimpacted SIPROTEC no longer performs designed protective functions – including overcurrent\nprotection[33] – on the relevant transmission lines even if still present, powered on, and network\naccessible. Essentially the receiving device is placed in an inoperative holding pattern for future\ninstructions. When triggered outside of normal or intended operations, this is a mission kill impact from\nthe perspective of the targeted SIPROTEC relay. The SIPROTEC is still present on the network but\nno longer performing intended functions due to the exploit. The result is an unprotected link in electric\ntransmission, with normal safeguards disabled.\n\nThe exploit condition is triggered by a single crafted UDP packet to UDP 50000 with the byte sequence\nshown in part in Figure 6. Sending this sequence will put SIPROTEC 4 and SIPROTEC Compact\ndevices before version 4.25 into the non-functional standby mode described in the previous\nparagraph.

August 15, 2019_ _10_\n\n\n-----\n\nAlthough ELECTRUM properly implemented the DoS condition in a binary targeting SIPROTEC\ndevices within the Ukrenergo network, the adversary made a coding mistake in overall communication\nimplementation affecting the executable’s functionality. Specific IP addresses – presumably for four\nSIPROTEC devices within the victim network – are hard-coded in the DoS binary employed in the\nCRASHOVERRIDE event. Yet when executed, the addresses are read backwards during\ncommunication socket creation. This is shown in Figure 7 with specific addresses obfuscated. While\nall devices reside on the same subnet as other control systems targeted in CRASHOVERRIDE’s\nmanipulation of transmission systems, the lack of endian awareness in socket creation results in\nnonsensical communications and makes the precise implementation of the SIPROTEC DoS in\nCRASHOVERRIDE inert.\n\n**_Figure 7: Packet Capture of Denial of Service Module Traffic_**\n\n# Implications for Protective Relay Denial of Service Attack\n\nAssessing the intended state of events when the SIPROTEC devices were supposed to be disabled\nreveals worrying ambitions. It highlights CRASHOVERRIDE as a deeply serious attack, albeit one\nthat failed in its goals due to various errors or mistakes noted earlier. Since ELECTRUM failed to\ndisable the protective relays used at the victim site and did not manipulate as many RTUs as intended,\nunderstanding what the group was attempting to achieve is conjecture – but sufficient information\nexists to make informed judgment on what the group’s ultimate goal was in 2016.\n\nELECTRUM disabled protective equipment after disconnecting breakers via logical means. Attackers\nthen deployed measures such as the service wiping and remapping to inhibit logical recovery, while\nalso rendering various SCADA devices non-functional eliminating accurate understanding,\ndiagnostics, and remote operations of the transmission site. According to analysis of the 2015 Ukraine\nevent, Ukrainian authorities possess and are willing to execute manual recovery procedures in the\nevent of emergencies in electric utility operations. While in a state of logical loss of view, protective\nrelays are still powered on and notionally active but the ability to ascertain their status is inhibited, if\nnot completely removed, given the overall status of the utility’s network during what was designed to\nbe a massive transmission and control disruption event. As such, operators are placed in a situation\nwhere they attempt to restore operations to normal as quickly as possible in a degraded operational\nenvironment without having an accurate picture of that environment’s current status – including the\nfunctionality of protection systems on lines about to be reconnected.\n\nWhen transmission equipment is reconnected to the overall electric utility network with no protective\nrelay in place, the range of potential outcomes is concerning, and expands the scope of impacts\nbeyond immediate transmission disruption. The most obvious potential effect, provided ELECTRUM\nsucceeded in its full-scale transmission interruption, is a surge when equipment is reconnected with\n\n_©2019 Dragos, Inc. All rights reserved. [Protected] Non-confidential content. August 15, 2019_ _11_\n\n\n-----\n\nno protection in place. This scenario produces a possible overcurrent event on the reconnected line\nwith the potential (depending on other backup and physical protection systems) to cause physical\ndamage to transmission equipment. Given that CRASHOVERRIDE was designed to cause a massive\ntransmission disruption by manipulating hundreds of devices, manual reconnection (taking place at a\nslower, more deliberate pace than what would be possible through normal SCADA operations)\nessentially connects a few lines at a time, resulting in potential overcurrent on the handful of\nreconnected lines during restoration. Normally, circumstances such as these would result in a fault\nand recovery through relay protection. But given the attack design, such protections are removed from\noperations allowing for potentially destructive scenarios to play out.\n\nOf note, the above represents a most-likely ELECTRUM intention in executing the\nCRASHOVERRIDE attack – but it is not clear that such an attack would be successful in an actual\noperating environment. The presence of various system redundancies and physical protection\nmechanisms may have mitigated against a potential destructive scenario at the Ukrenergo site. More\ngenerally, impacts at a specific site will depend upon a litany of other factors – such as redundant\nrelays and the presence and functionality of backup protection devices – making generalization from\nCRASHOVERRIDE to any transmission site difficult to impossible. However, the overall sequence of\nevents indicates clear intentions on the part of ELECTRUM to place the targeted transmission site\ninto an unsafe and potentially dangerous state. Given the intended (if unrealized) scale of\nCRASHOVERRIDE’s impact to transmission operations, the potential load at time of reconnect would\nhave been significant, and potentially amenable to a scenario resulting in physical damage to\ntransmission equipment, producing a longer-lasting outage due to the need for repairs and\nreplacement gear.\n\nThe combination of de-energizing transmission, eliminating process view and control, disabling\nprotective systems, and knowing the victim’s recourse to manual restoration of operations identifies a\ncomplex, multi-stage attack designed to do far more than simply interrupt the flow of electricity for a\nlimited period of time. Instead, analyzing CRASHOVERRIDE as it was designed shifts the event from\na largely logical, network-focused incident to the unique realm of cyber-induced, physical damage\nevents so far only successfully achieved by Stuxnet. If CRASHOVERRIDE worked as ELECTRUM\nmost likely intended, the potential outage would have been more widespread than 2015 given the\nnumber of transmission devices targeted. Additionally, the duration of the outage may have stretched\nto months or longer if disabling protection prior to system restoration yielded physical damage to\ntransmission operations. While the actual efficacy of CRASHOVERRIDE – even if it had worked as\nintended – remains unclear given a myriad of other controls and safeguards in electric transmission,\nthe sequence of steps executed clearly demonstrates a more complex and concerning attack than\npast electric service disruptions.\n\n# Lessons from CRASHOVERRIDE as a Protection Attack\n\nVarious pieces of CRASHOVERRIDE and artifacts associated with targeting suggest ELECTRUM’s\nintentions exceeded the effects of the 2015 event, but they failed due to poor understanding or\nimplementation of ICS communication protocols within the victim’s environment. Even if all items\ndeployed worked as intended, fundamental aspects of electric transmission and substation design\nmay have prevented the scenario playing out as likely desired. However, focusing on ELECTRUM’s\nfailures obscures the worrying ambition behind CRASHOVERRIDE. By timing a transmission outage\nwith both a loss of control and loss of view attack and disabling protective relays on impacted circuits,\n\n_©2019 Dragos, Inc. All rights reserved. [Protected] Non-confidential content. August 15, 2019_ _12_\n\n\n-----\n\nELECTRUM aimed for a far more significant and long-lasting effect: physical degradation or\ndestruction of transmission equipment, with the desire to produce impacts lasting months instead of\nhours.\n\nELECTRUM failed in its attack for various reasons, but the event still provides multiple, actionable\nlessons to electric utility operators from generation to transmission to distribution. Operators must\nrecognize adversaries have moved beyond switching things off and employing some mechanisms to\ndelay recovery to targeting the fundamental protection systems underpinning electric utility operations.\nThis element of protection-focused attack is also observed in more recent events such as TRISIS.[35]\nWhile both CRASHOVERRIDE and TRISIS failed in their execution (and may have both been\nprevented by other safeguards within the targeted systems), they demonstrate clear intention and\nwillingness on the part of adversaries to expand operations in ICS environments to potential physically\ndestructive scenarios. The implications for such attacks are significant and severe. In the rush to\nrestore transmission in CRASHOVERRIDE, operators can inadvertently enable physical destruction\nif attackers successfully subvert protection mechanisms and operator visibility into protection systems.\n\nQuickly and accurately diagnosing ICS impacts and effectively responding to disruptive events\nrequires efforts to increase visibility, monitoring, and root cause analysis capability. In the case of\nCRASHOVERRIDE, identifying the combination of breaker manipulation with protective relay\ncommunication can alert asset owners that an adversary is attempting to set up the necessary\npreconditions for a potential destructive event. This is an example of a threat behavior analytic\ncombining multiple observables that can be used to quickly detect, disposition, and respond to\nsequences of events in ICS environments.[36] In this fashion, the victim can properly grasp the scope\nand potential implications of the outage given the detected sequence of events, allowing for a more\nmeasured response than simply rushing to manually restore operations as quickly as possible – with\nthe possibility of producing an unsafe operating environment.\n\nAt an even higher level, detecting or responding to CRASHOVERRIDE effectively across the scope\nof the ICS cyber kill chain of events necessary to actually enable and execute an attack yields even\nmore defensive possibilities. Marrying IT-centric information highlighting ELECTRUM’s penetration of\nthe control system network with subsequent ICS-specific communication can accelerate root cause\nanalysis of subsequent disruption events. This also provides operators with sufficient visibility and\nknowledge (even absent disabled SCADA equipment) to identify the event as a likely coordinated\nattack across multiple layers of grid operations. From this, utilities can take appropriate action and\ncaution in responding to events and restoring operations. Furthermore, the victim will then possess\nknowledge on the full scope of the intrusion and subsequent attack, to ensure complete network\nrecovery and remediation to prevent a potential re-compromise of the environment.\n\nLastly, asset owners and operators may discount CRASHOVERRIDE’s and ELECTRUM’s aims,\ngiven multiple failures in attack implementation and some fundamental misunderstandings of electric\nutility operations and safeguards. Yet adopting such a stance is not only misguided, but dangerous.\nThe progression of attacks from the mostly-manual 2015 Ukraine event to the increased automation\n\n35 **[TRISIS Malware – Dragos;](https://dragos.com/wp-content/uploads/TRISIS-01.pdf)** **[Attackers Deploy New ICS Attack Framework “TRITON” and Cause](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/12/attackers-deploy-new-ics-attack-framework-triton.html)**\n**[Operational Disruption to Critical Infrastructure – Blake Johnson, Dan Caban, Marina Krotofil, Dan Scali,](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/12/attackers-deploy-new-ics-attack-framework-triton.html)**\nNathan Brubaker, and Christopher Gloyer, FireEye\n36 **[Threat Analytics and Activity Groups – Joe Slowik, Dragos; Indicators and ICS Network Defense – Joe](https://dragos.com/blog/industry-news/threat-analytics-and-activity-groups/)**\nSlowik, Dragos\n\n_©2019 Dragos, Inc.

CRASHOVERRIDE itself may have fallen short of its intentions, but ELECTRUM (and other\nadversaries) will learn from this event and adapt in future operations. CRASHOVERRIDE’s\nshortcomings demonstrate the complexity and sophistication of cyber attacks on ICS networks to\nproduce physical impacts – but CRASHOVERRIDE’s existence clearly signals adversary intent and\ndesire to develop such capabilities. ICS asset owners and operators must take such attempts\nseriously, and deploy defenses before attackers are able to deploy a fully-functional, ICS-aware attack\nin the future.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nCRASHOVERRIDE was a failure in operations, especially when viewed from the perspective of actual\nimpacts relative to the 2015 Ukraine power event. Yet further analysis of the event and its implications\nreveals a far more complex, nuanced, and concerning attack than its precursor. Through an attempted\nmulti-stage manipulation of transmission operations, ICS visibility, and ultimately protection systems,\nELECTRUM sought to create the preconditions for a possible physically-destructive event when the\nvictim restored operations. While actual predictions of CRASHOVERRIDE’s impact had it worked\ncorrectly is a matter of conjecture, the adversary’s intent appears clear after analyzing all stages of\nthe attack – establishing circumstances to create an unsafe, potentially destructive scenario within the\nvictim transmission equipment.\n\nThe victim in 2016 avoided a worst-case scenario. Moving forward, electric utility operators must be\naware of how adversaries executed this attack and its implications for operations. By adopting a\nwhole-of-attack approach to reviewing what ELECTRUM tried but failed to do, ICS asset owners and\noperators can begin developing and deploying the required visibility, resilience, and response\nmeasures needed to cope with an attack like CRASHOVERRIDE.\n\n# Acknowledgments\n\nAs with so many things, this paper would not have been possible without the efforts and assistance\nof others.
