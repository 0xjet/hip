By 2015, Kaspersky\n[documented 500 malware infections by the group in at least 42 countries, while](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware)\nacknowledging that the actual number could be in the tens of thousands due to its selfterminating protocol.[5][6]\n\n[In 2017, WikiLeaks published a discussion held within the CIA on how it had been possible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vault_7)\nto identify the group.[7] One commenter wrote that \"the Equation Group as labeled in the\nreport does not relate to a specific group but rather a collection of tools\" used for hacking.[8]\n\n\n## Discovery\n\nAt the Kaspersky Security Analysts Summit held in Mexico on February 16, 2015, Kaspersky\nLab announced its discovery of the Equation Group. According to Kaspersky Lab's report,\nthe group has been active since at least 2001, with more than 60 actors.[9] The malware\nused in their operations, dubbed EquationDrug and GrayFish, is found to be capable of\n[reprogramming hard disk drive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk_drive) [firmware.[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmware) Because of the advanced techniques involved\nand high degree of covertness, the group is suspected of ties to the NSA, but Kaspersky Lab\nhas not identified the actors behind the group.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Probable links to Stuxnet and the NSA\n\nIn 2015 Kaspersky's research findings on the Equation Group noted that its loader,\n[\"Grayfish\", had similarities to a previously discovered loader, \"Gauss\",[repository]](https://github.com/loneicewolf/Gauss-Src) from another\nattack series, and separately noted that the Equation Group used two zero-day attacks later\nused in [Stuxnet; the researchers concluded that \"the similar type of usage of both exploits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet)\ntogether in different computer worms, at around the same time, indicates that the EQUATION\ngroup and the Stuxnet developers are either the same or working closely together\".[10]: 13\n\n\n### Firmware\n\n[They also identified that the platform had at times been spread by interdiction (interception of](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdiction)\n[legitimate CDs sent by a scientific conference organizer by mail),[10]: 15 and that the platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mail)\n[had the \"unprecedented\" ability to infect and be transmitted through the hard drive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_drive) [firmware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmware)\nof several major hard drive manufacturers, and create and use hidden disk areas and virtual\ndisk systems for its purposes, a feat which would require access to the manufacturer's\n[source code to achieve,[10]: 16–18 and that the tool was designed for surgical precision, going](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code)\nso far as to exclude specific countries by IP and allow targeting of specific usernames on\n[discussion forums.[10]: 23–26](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discussion_forum)\n\n\n### Codewords and timestamps\n\nThe NSA codewords \"STRAITACID\" and \"STRAITSHOOTER\" have been found inside the\n[malware. In addition, timestamps in the malware seem to indicate that the programmers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timestamps)\nworked overwhelmingly Monday–Friday in what would correspond to a 08:00–17:00 (8:00\nAM - 5:00 PM) workday in an Eastern United States time zone.[11]\n\n### The LNK exploit\n\n\nKaspersky's global research and analysis team, otherwise known as GReAT, claimed to have\nfound a piece of malware that contained Stuxnet's \"privLib\" in 2008.[12] Specifically it\ncontained the LNK exploit found in Stuxnet in 2010. Fanny is classified as a worm that\naffects certain [Windows operating systems and attempts to spread laterally via network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows)\n[connection or USB storage.[repository]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Serial_Bus) Kaspersky stated that they suspect that the Equation\nGr[4] oup has been around longer than Stuxnet, based on the recorded compile time of Fanny.\n\n### Link to IRATEMONK\n\n\n-----\n\n[The NSA's listing of its Tailored Access Operations program named IRATEMONK from the](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tailored_Access_Operations)\n[NSA ANT catalog.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSA_ANT_catalog)\n[F-Secure claims that the Equation Group's malicious hard drive firmware is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-Secure) [TAO program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tailored_Access_Operations)\n\"IRATEMONK\",[13] one of the items from the [NSA ANT catalog exposed in a 2013 Der](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSA_ANT_catalog)\n_Spiegel article.
