    "plain_text": "# Treasury Sanctions Russian Government Research Institution Connected to the Triton Malware\n\n**home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm1162**\n\nOctober 23, 2020\n\n**Washington – Today, the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control**\n(OFAC) designated, pursuant to Section 224 of the Countering America’s Adversaries\nThrough Sanctions Act (CAATSA), a Russian government research institution that is\nconnected to the destructive Triton malware. The Triton malware — known also as TRISIS\nand HatMan in open source reporting — was designed specifically to target and manipulate\nindustrial safety systems. Such systems provide for the safe emergency shutdown of\nindustrial processes at critical infrastructure facilities in order to protect human life. The cyber\nactors behind the Triton malware have been referred to by the private cybersecurity industry\nas “the most dangerous threat activity publicly known.”\n\n“The Russian Government continues to engage in dangerous cyber activities aimed at the\nUnited States and our allies,” said Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin. “This Administration will\ncontinue to aggressively defend the critical infrastructure of the United States from anyone\nattempting to disrupt it.”\n\nIn recent years, the Triton malware has been deployed against U.S. partners in the Middle\nEast, and the hackers behind the malware have been reportedly scanning and probing U.S.\nfacilities. The development and deployment of the Triton malware against our partners is\nparticularly troubling given the Russian government’s involvement in malicious and\n\n\n-----\n\ndangerous cyber-enabled activities. Previous examples of Russia s reckless activities in\ncyberspace include, but are not limited to: the NotPetya cyber-attack, the most destructive\nand costly cyber-attack in history; cyber intrusions against the U.S. energy grid to potentially\nenable future offensive operations; the targeting of international organizations such as the\nOrganization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and the World Anti-Doping Agency;\nand the 2019 disruptive cyber-attack against the country of Georgia.\n\n**Triton Malware**\n\nIn August 2017, a petrochemical facility in the Middle East was the target of a cyber-attack\ninvolving the Triton malware. This cyber-attack was supported by the State Research\n**Center of the Russian Federation FGUP Central Scientific Research Institute of**\n**Chemistry and Mechanics (TsNIIKhM), a Russian government-controlled research**\ninstitution that is responsible for building customized tools that enabled the attack.\n\nThe Triton malware was designed to target a specific industrial control system (ICS)\ncontroller used in some critical infrastructure facilities to initiate immediate shutdown\nprocedures in the event of an emergency. The malware was initially deployed through\nphishing that targeted the petrochemical facility. Once the malware gained a foothold, its\noperators attempted to manipulate the facility’s ICS controllers. During the attack, the facility\nautomatically shut down after several of the ICS controllers entered into a failed safe state,\npreventing the malware’s full functionality from being deployed, and prompting an\ninvestigation that ultimately led to the discovery of the malware. Researchers who\ninvestigated the cyber-attack and the malware reported that Triton was designed to give the\nattackers complete control of infected systems and had the capability to cause significant\nphysical damage and loss of life. In 2019, the attackers behind the Triton malware were also\nreported to be scanning and probing at least 20 electric utilities in the United States for\nvulnerabilities.\n\n**TsNIIKhM is being designated pursuant to Section 224 of CAATSA for knowingly engaging in**\nsignificant activities undermining cybersecurity against any person, including a democratic\ninstitution, or government on behalf of the Government of the Russian Federation.\n\nAs a result of today’s designation, all property and interests in property of TsNIIKhM that are\nin or come within the possession of U.S. persons are blocked, and U.S. persons are\ngenerally prohibited from engaging in transactions with them. Additionally, any entities 50\npercent or more owned by one or more designated persons are also blocked. Moreover, nonU.S. persons who engage in certain transactions with TsNIIKhM may themselves be exposed\nto sanctions.\n\n[View identifying information on the entity designated today.](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/recent-actions/20201023)\n\nUse featured image\n\nOff\n\n\n-----",
