According to the ransom\nnote, if the ransom is not paid by the company within 3 days, and aside from leaking part of\nthe stolen data, they will distribute via mass media where the company's partners and clients\nwill know that the company was attacked.\n\nThe sample we analyzed has many anti-analysis techniques in place, such as code\nobfuscation and packed payloads. Also, in one of the execution stages, the Egregor payload\ncan only be decrypted if the correct key is provided in the process' command line, which\nmeans that the file cannot be analyzed, either manually or using a sandbox, if the exact\n\n\n-----\n\nsame command line that the attackers used to run the ransomware isn t provided.\nFurthermore, our team found the \"Egregor news\" website, hosted on the deep web, which\nthe criminal group uses to leak stolen data.\n\nAt the time of this advisory, there is at least 13 different companies listed in their \"hall of\nshame\", including the global logistic company GEFCO, which suffered a cyber attack last\nweek. Egregors' ransom note also says that aside from decrypting all the files in the event\nthe company pays the ransom, they will also provide recommendations for securing the\ncompany's network, \"helping\" them to avoid being breached again, acting as some sort of\nblack hat pentest team.\n\n**About Appgate**\n\nAppgate is the secure access company that provides cybersecurity solutions for people,\ndevices and systems based on the principles of Zero Trust security.
