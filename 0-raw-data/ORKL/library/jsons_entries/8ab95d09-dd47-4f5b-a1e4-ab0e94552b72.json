In a\nsubsequent attack almost six weeks later this foothold was used to deploy the RYUK\nransomware on the victim network.\n\nThis attack marks the first instance Truesec has observed of the combination of FIN7\ntools and the RYUK ransomware, indicating a change in pattern for FIN7 attacks. Up\nuntil now FIN7 has not been associated with ransomware attacks. This also suggests a\ncloser collaboration between FIN7 and the RYUK group, also known as WIZARD\nSPIDER or FIN6, than has been previously known by Truesec.\n\nIt is possible FIN7 simply sold the access to the RYUK group, but it is probable that FIN7\nand WIZARD SPIDER are more closely affiliated and may be part of the same organized\ncrime network.\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nThreat actors are constantly evolving and changing their methods. FIN7 is a\nfinancially motivated threat group that in the past has targeted the retail, restaurant, and\nhospitality sectors since mid-2015. They are known to use the CARBANAK RAT for mailhijacking and point-of-sale attacks.\n\nThis summer Truesec observed an attacker that used the tools and techniques of FIN7,\nincluding the CARBANAK RAT, to take over the network of an enterprise. Later this\nfoothold was used to deploy the RYUK ransomware on the victim network.\n\nThis attack marks the first instance Truesec has observed of the combination of FIN7\ntools and the RYUK ransomware, indicating a change in pattern for FIN7 attacks. Up\nuntil now FIN7 has not been associated with ransomware attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\nGiven that ransomware is now the preferred technique for financially motivated attacks,\nit is not surprising that FIN7 also switch to ransomware. The attack also indicates\nthat FIN7 now collaborates with the RYUK group, also known as WIZARD SPIDER or\nFIN6, in financially motivated attacks.\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\n\n### Stage 1 – The Phishing\n\nThe first part of the attack was a phishing email claiming to be from UPS.\n\n_Figure 1 – phishing mail_\n\nThe link in the email redirected the victim to a sharepoint URL that\ndownloads a ZIP file, “Data .zip”, which included a VBS script in the archive, which in\nturn dropped another script that launched a JavaScript backdoor on the\n\n\n-----\n\n[victim machine. Using a VBS script to drop JavaScript is a known method used by](https://blog.morphisec.com/fin7-not-finished-morphisec-spots-new-campaign)\nFIN7 and similar groups.\n\n### Stage 2 – The take over\n\n**JavaScript backdoor**\n\n[This appears to be the same as the JavaScript backdoor in an article by Morphisec from](https://blog.morphisec.com/fin7-not-finished-morphisec-spots-new-campaign)\nNovember 2018. As described in the article this was used by FIN7 to deploy\nthe CARBANAK RAT.\n\nThe backdoor connected to domain sephardimension[.]com. Some of the functions of the\nJavaScript backdoor are illustrated below.\n\n_Figure 2 – Part of JavaScript backdoor_\n\n_Figure 3 – Part of JavaScript backdoor_\n\n_Figure 4 – Part of JavaScript backdoor_\n\n\n-----\n\n[These functions are clearly later versions of the code illustrated in the article](https://blog.morphisec.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blog_images/18-Q4/FIN7-11.png?width=600&name=FIN7-11.png)\nby Morphisec.\n\nFrom the JavaScript backdoor on the compromised client, the threat actor began\nperforming typical escalation attempts in the Active Directory.\n\n**PowerShell RAT**\n\nOnce the attacker had ensured they\nhad admin privileges, they launched RunPsExec against several clients and servers to\ninstall a second malicious code, a PowerShell RAT, previously unknown to Truesec. The\nPowerShell RAT connected to another malicious\ndomain: hxxps://besaintegration[.]com/gate.\n\nThe PowerShell RAT includes functions to retrieve basic system information and\nprovides capabilities to start and manage arbitrary commands as background jobs.\n\nThe different functions are illustrated below.\n\n_Figure 5 – Part of PowerShell RAT_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6 – Part of PowerShell RAT_\n\n_Figure 7 – Part of PowerShell RAT_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8 – Part of PowerShell RAT_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 9 – Part of PowerShell RAT_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 10 – Part of PowerShell RAT_\n\n**CARBANAK RAT**\n\nThe last action the attacker performed at this stage\nwas to also install the CARBANAK RAT as an additional backdoor onto domain\ncontrollers of the victim network. The attacker downloaded an obfuscated script that\nwhen executed, loads a DLL file in memory and executes it through reflection methods.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 11 – Decompressed script_\n\nIt then connects to Command-and-Control server 170.130.55[.]85:443 in order\n[to download the malware configuration file anunak_config which is a known component](https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/new-carbanak-anunak-attack-methodology/)\nof the CARBANAK RAT. Once the CARBANAK RAT was installed, it would beacon to the\nsame C2 server.\n\nOnce the actor had deployed the PowerShell RAT and CARBANAK RAT, no further\naction was taken on the compromised network for several weeks.\n\n### Stage 3 – The Reconnaissance\n\n**Cobalt Strike**\n\nThe third stage of the attack began several weeks after the initial compromise and lasted\nabout a week. The attacker deployed Cobalt Strike on the network and began\nreconnaissance and data discovery on the network. This part of the attack was conducted\n\n\n-----\n\nfrom a completely different infrastructure than the first two stages.\n\n**Data theft**\n\nDuring this stage, the attacker also exfiltrated data from the victim network. The\nexfiltration was done using the SmartFTP Client that connected\nto an IP address controlled by the attacker.\n\nThe names of some of the files that were exfiltrated were found in the file “UnlockerList.txt”. This file is part of the IObit Unlocker software, installed by the attacker, likely\nto facilitate the ransomware execution or file copy operations by unlocking locked files.\n\n### Stage 4 – The Ransomware\n\n**RYUK Ransomware**\n\nA week after the attacker had begun reconnaissance of the network and\nexfiltrated the data they wanted; they deployed the RYUK ransomware. The\nRansomware was deployed using both manual and scripted methods.\n\nThe high-level description of the staging procedure is summarized below:\n\n1. Identify server hostnames and IP addresses in the domain\n2. Prepare batch file to disable protections and security software (kill.bat)\n3. Prepare RYUK ransomware (svchost.exe)\n4. Copy kill.bat\n\n5. Disable User Account Control\n6. Run kill.bat\n\n7. Copy RYUK ransomware (svchost.exe)\n8. Run RYUK ransomware (svchost.exe)\n\nSteps 4-8 were performed on all identified servers in the victim network, using both IP\naddress and hostname. Remote code execution was achieved with two methods: remote\nWMI command execution and using Microsoft Sysinternals’ utility PsExec.\n\n## CONCLUSIONS\n\nThe first two stages of the attack, when the attacker took over the network, clearly bears\nthe mark of the criminal threat actor known as FIN7. Both the JavaScript\nbackdoor and the way it was installed, and CARBANAK RAT are tools that have been\nattributed to FIN7. No attempt to identify resources in the network was made at this\ntime, once the attacker had control of the network.\n\nThe subsequent stages, in which data was stolen and a ransomware was\ndeployed, occurred almost six weeks after the initial compromise. This part of the\nattack was done using tools and techniques that are indicative of the\n\n\n-----\n\n[RYUK ransomware group, also known as WIZARD SPIDER or FIN6.](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0446/)\nThis was also conducted from an entirely different infrastructure than the initial\nstages attributed to FIN7.\n\nThe progress of the attack clearly indicates that different stages of the attack were\nconducted by different teams. It’s possible that the FIN7 group are now more focused on\njust gaining access and then let a team from the RYUK group take over and deploy\nransomware.\n\nThis suggests a closer collaboration between FIN7 and the RYUK group than has been\npreviously known by Truesec. It is possible FIN7 simply sold the access to the RYUK\ngroup, but it is probable that the two groups have even stronger ties.\n[The RYUK group are known to contract affiliates to gain foothold for their ransomware](https://intel471.com/blog/ransomware-as-a-service-2020-ryuk-maze-revil-egregor-doppelpaymer/)\nattacks.\n\nIt consequently seems possible that FIN7 and WIZARD SPIDER are now both part of the\nsame sprawling organized crime network.\n\n## Appendix – IOC\n\n**domains**\n\ndmnadmin[.]com\n\nsendbits.m2stor4ge[.]xyz\n\nmyrric-uses.singlejets[.]com\n\nbesaintegration[.]com\n\nsephardimension[.]com\n\n**IP addresses**\n\n\n-----\n\n45.11.180.14\n\n45.11.180.76\n\n45.11.180.83\n\n45.91.93.89\n\n46.166.161.104\n\n46.166.161.159\n\n170.130.55.85\n\n185.163.45.185\n\n185.212.44.231\n\n185.212.47.100\n\n193.178.169.203\n\n194.76.225.76\n\n194.76.225.77\n\n194.76.225.78\n\n194.76.225.79\n\n194.76.226.202\n\n195.2.93.17\n\n**MD5 hashes**\n\n10AA7B8AB8D0D1C650FFFE01AFB90CEE\n\n19ADFCD1E2B02D655531CE53B39CDD79\n\n166686D538EC9A0E0550347149AAC4CC\n\nBDED054D3176EEFEEDB4470DF9EE4716\n\nD1092764732C9A9B88AAAD727D1D4F94\n\n9836248A42FF7FA89AE8D6D849D361F7\n\nBA86E99056C33A4B64B08DADE708B041\n\n0C392BC26565BDD41B7A663EFD60BF0C\n\n1643B85E7F459C6FFE1E5AB9EBB53F93\n\nC1BE2260C7673096D8F083AE69DFF5D0\n\n\n-----\n\n**SHA256 hashes**\n\nFCAAF4B85C42BEC0426CE7A827F437C3CF0E2C502A393DD8C3C327F035FE1A2C\n\n1BBE96A888C6E3A52CDB0676F38A8A379A72E6F4ADE58F101A0559C7AD6F99C7\n\n53430ABD76A5CFCFADA4962CD8925B2E32620C44A8863B445BA145F42DBFEA64\n\nB49CA670CD9CEF54A5F372375BD6CA1BE7B68FD68535D6498374970CD69AAAE2\n\nD9A6DD7216FAAFC65D419D09B6B7B5DDF24991A1F65F23113DDE40D4936EEA55\n\n992785A27987A99B2B1EE0475457A0E548F5DD704429C3528C335C315FF089F5\n\n363775EC196DC5F5C435068B4237C42C2038BD15EF40FD453FA1F49C827BDAF2\n\n8141F47A1EE8453AC01DAACB16CAB2D18B37A9045EDC5F20C9019D4327576704\n\nA428716A6891C67CD70DD17769158060298B431F06A483A1E34D58D71F2B34DB\n\n\n-----",
