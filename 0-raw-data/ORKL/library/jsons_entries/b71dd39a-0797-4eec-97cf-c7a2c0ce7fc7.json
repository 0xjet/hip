Following this naming convention, we opted to name the\n[strain we found piggybacking on the wiper, HermeticRansom. According to analysis done](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/how-to-decrypt-the-partyticket-ransomware-targeting-ukraine/)\nbyCrowdstrike’s Intelligence Team, the ransomware contains a weakness in the crypto\nschema and can be decrypted for free.\n\nIf your device has been infected with HermeticRansom and you’d like to decrypt your files,\nclick here to skip to the How to use the Avast decryptor to recover files\n\n### Go!\n\nThe ransomware is written in GO language. When executed, it searches local drives and\nnetwork shares for potentially valuable files, looking for files with one of the extensions\nlisted below (the order is taken from the sample):\n```\n  .docx .doc .dot .odt .pdf .xls .xlsx .rtf .ppt .pptx .one.xps .pub .vsd\n .txt .jpg .jpeg .bmp .ico .png .gif .sql.xml .pgsql .zip .rar .exe .msi\n .vdi .ova .avi .dip .epub.iso .sfx .inc .contact .url .mp3 .wmv .wma .wtv\n .avi .acl.cfg .chm .crt .css .dat .dll .cab .htm .html .encryptedjb\n\n```\nIn order to keep the victim’s PC operational, the ransomware avoids encrypting files in\nProgram Files and Windows folders.\n\nFor every file designated for encryption, the ransomware creates a 32-byte encryption key.\nFiles are encrypted by blocks, each block has `1048576 ( 0x100000 ) bytes. A maximum`\nof nine blocks are encrypted. Any data past `9437184 bytes ( 0x900000 ) is left in plain`\n\n\n-----\n\ntext. Each block is encrypted by `AES GCM symmetric cipher. After data encryption, the`\nransomware appends a file tail, containing the `RSA-2048 encrypted file key. The public`\nkey is stored in the binary as a `Base64` encoded string:\n\nEncrypted file names are given extra suffix:\n\n```\n.[vote2024forjb@protonmail.com].encryptedJB\n\n```\n\nWhen done, a file named “ read_me.html ” is saved to the user’s `Desktop folder:`\n\nThere is an interesting amount of politically oriented strings in the ransomware binary. In\naddition to the file extension, referring to the re-election of Joe Biden in 2024, there is also a\nreference to him in the project name:\n\n\n-----\n\nDuring the execution, the ransomware creates a large amount of child processes, that do\nthe actual encryption:\n\n## How to use the Avast decryptor to recover files\n\nTo decrypt your files, please, follow these steps:\n\n[1. Download the free Avast decryptor.](https://files.avast.com/files/decryptor/avast_decryptor_hermeticransom.exe)\n2. Simply run the executable file. It starts in the form of a wizard, which leads you\n\nthrough the configuration of the decryption process.\n3. On the initial page, you can read the license information, if you want, but you really\n\nonly need to click “ Next “\n\n\n-----\n\n1. On the next page, select the list of locations which you want to be searched and\n\ndecrypted. By default, it contains a list of all local drives:\n\n\n-----\n\n1. On the final wizard page, you can opt-in whether you want to backup encrypted files.\n\nThese backups may help if anything goes wrong during the decryption process. This\noption is turned on by default, which we recommend. After clicking “ Decrypt ”, the\ndecryption process begins. Let the decryptor work and wait until it finishes.\n\n\n-----\n\n## IOCs\n\nSHA256: `4dc13bb83a16d4ff9865a51b3e4d24112327c526c1392e14d56f20d6f4eaf382`\n\n[Tagged asanalysis,](https://decoded.avast.io/tag/analysis/) [decryptors,](https://decoded.avast.io/tag/decryptors/) [malware,](https://decoded.avast.io/tag/malware/) [ransomware,](https://decoded.avast.io/tag/ransomware/) [reversing](https://decoded.avast.io/tag/reversing/)\n\n\n-----",
