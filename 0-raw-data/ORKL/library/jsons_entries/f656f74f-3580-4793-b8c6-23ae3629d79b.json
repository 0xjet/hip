    "plain_text": "# Countering hack-for-hire groups\n\n**[blog.google/threat-analysis-group/countering-hack-for-hire-groups/](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/countering-hack-for-hire-groups/)**\n\nShane Huntley June 30, 2022\n\n[Threat Analysis Group](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/)\n\nAs part of TAG's mission to counter serious threats to Google and our users, we've published\nanalysis on a range of persistent threats including government-backed attackers, commercial\nsurveillance vendors, and serious criminal operators. Today, we're sharing intelligence on a\nsegment of attackers we call hack-for-hire, whose niche focuses on compromising accounts\nand exfiltrating data as a service.\n\nIn contrast to commercial surveillance vendors, who we generally observe selling a capability\nfor the end user to operate, hack-for-hire firms conduct attacks themselves. They target a\nwide range of users and opportunistically take advantage of known security flaws when\nundertaking their campaigns. Both, however, enable attacks by those who would otherwise\nlack the capabilities to do so.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe have seen hack-for-hire groups target human rights and political activists, journalists, and\nother high-risk users around the world, putting their privacy, safety and security at risk. They\nalso conduct corporate espionage, handily obscuring their clients’ role.\n\nTo help users and defenders, we will provide examples of the hack-for-hire ecosystem from\nIndia, Russia, and the United Arab Emirates and context around their capabilities and\npersistence mechanisms.\n\n## How Hack-For-Hire Operations Work\n\nThe hack-for-hire landscape is fluid, both in how the attackers organize themselves and in\nthe wide range of targets they pursue in a single campaign at the behest of disparate clients.\nSome hack-for-hire attackers openly advertise their products and services to anyone willing\nto pay, while others operate more discreetly selling to a limited audience.\n\nFor example, TAG has observed Indian hack-for-hire firms work with third party private\ninvestigative services — intermediaries that reach out for services when a client requires\nthem — and provide data exfiltrated from a successful operation. This is detailed in depth in\n[today’s Reuters investigation into the Indian hack-for-hire ecosystem. We have also](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-hackers-litigation/)\nobserved Indian hack-for-hire firms work with freelance actors not directly employed by the\nfirms themselves.\n\nThe breadth of targets in hack-for-hire campaigns stands in contrast to many governmentbacked operations, which often have a clearer delineation of mission and targets. A recent\ncampaign from an Indian hack-for-hire operator was observed targeting an IT company in\nCyprus, an education institution in Nigeria, a fintech company in the Balkans and a shopping\ncompany in Israel.\n\n## Recent Hack-for-Hire Campaigns\n\n**India**\n\nSince 2012, TAG has been tracking an interwoven set of Indian hack-for-hire actors, with\n[many having previously worked for Indian offensive security providers Appin and](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324634304578539462436752602) [Belltrox.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-cyber-mercenaries-exclusive/exclusive-obscure-indian-cyber-firm-spied-on-politicians-investors-worldwide-idUSKBN23G1GQ)\n\nOne cluster of this activity frequently targets government, healthcare, and telecom sectors in\nSaudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain with credential phishing campaigns.\nThese credential phishing campaigns have ranged from targeting specific government\norganizations to AWS accounts to Gmail accounts.\n\n\n-----\n\nSample AWS phishing email\n\nSample AWS phishing page\n\n\n-----\n\nTAG has linked former employees of both Appin and Belltrox to Rebsec, a new firm that\nopenly advertises corporate espionage as an offering on its company website.\n\nRebsec’s offerings as per the company’s website\n\n**Russia**\n\nWhile investigating a 2017 credential phishing campaign that targeted a prominent Russian\nanti-corruption journalist, we discovered the Russian attacker targeting other journalists,\npoliticians across Europe, and various NGOs and non-profit organizations. But what stuck\nout during this investigation was the breadth of targeting, which also included individuals that\nhad no affiliation with the selected organizations, and appeared to be regular, everyday\ncitizens in Russia and surrounding countries. This hack-for-hire actor has been publicly\nreferred to as ['Void Balaur'.](https://documents.trendmicro.com/assets/white_papers/wp-void-balaur-tracking-a-cybermercenarys-activities.pdf)\n\nThese campaigns were similar regardless of target, consisting of a credential phishing email\nwith a link to an attacker-controlled phishing page. The lures ranged from fake Gmail and\nother webmail provider notifications to messages spoofing Russian government\norganizations. After the target account was compromised, the attacker generally maintained\npersistence by granting an OAuth token to a legitimate email application like Thunderbird or\n[generating an App Password to access the account via IMAP. Both OAuth tokens and App](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en)\nPasswords are revoked when a user changes their password.\n\n\n-----\n\nRussian hack-for-hire phishing email\n\n\n-----\n\nRussian hack-for-hire phishing site\n\nDuring our early investigation, TAG discovered the attacker’s public website (no longer\navailable) advertising account hacking capabilities for email and social media services. The\nsite claimed to have received positive reviews on Russian underground forums such as\nDublikat and Probiv.cc. Over the past five years, TAG has observed the group targeting\naccounts at major webmail providers like Gmail, Hotmail, and Yahoo! and regional webmail\nproviders like abv.bg, mail.ru, inbox.lv, and UKR.net.\n\n\n-----\n\nPricing list from hacknet-service.com in 2018\n\n**United Arab Emirates**\n\nTAG is also tracking a hack-for-hire group now based in the United Arab Emirates that is\nmostly active in the Middle East and North Africa. They have primarily targeted government,\neducation, and political organizations including Middle East focused NGOs in Europe and the\n[Palestinian political party Fatah. Amnesty International has also reported on their campaigns.](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/research/2018/12/when-best-practice-is-not-good-enough/)\n\nThe group commonly uses Google or OWA password reset lures to steal credentials from\ntargets, often using the MailJet or SendGrid API to send phishing emails. Unlike many hack[for-hire actors that use open source phishing frameworks like Evilginx or](https://github.com/kgretzky/evilginx2) [GoPhish, this group](https://github.com/gophish/gophish)\n[uses a custom phishing kit that utilizes Selenium, a self described 'suite of tools for](https://www.selenium.dev/)\nautomating web browsers.' Previously described by Amnesty, this phishing kit has remained\nunder active development over the past five years\n\n\n-----\n\nGoogle Security Alert phishing page\n\nAfter compromising an account, the actor maintains persistence by granting themselves an\nOAuth token to a legitimate email app like Thunderbird, or by linking the victim Gmail\n[account to an attacker-owned account on a third-party mail provider. The attacker would then](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/add-your-other-email-accounts-to-outlook-com-c5224df4-5885-4e79-91ba-523aa743f0ba)\nuse a custom tool to download the mailbox contents via IMAP.\n\n[This group also has links to the original developers of H-Worm, also known as njRAT. In](https://blog.morphisec.com/hworm-houdini-aka-njrat)\n[2014, Microsoft filed a civil suit against the developer, Mohammed Benabdellah, for the](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/microsoft_blog/microsoft-takes-on-global-cybercrime-epidemic-in-tenth-malware-disruption)\ndevelopment and dissemination of H-Worm. Benabdellah, who also goes by the moniker\nHoudini, has been actively involved in the day-to-day development and operational\ndeployment of the credential phishing capabilities used by this group since its inception.\n\n## Protecting Our Users\n\nAs part of our efforts to combat serious threat actors, we use results of our research to\nimprove the safety and security of our products. Upon discovery, all identified websites and\n[domains were added to Safe Browsing to protect users from further harm. We encourage](https://safebrowsing.google.com/)\n[any high risk user to enable Advanced Protection and](https://landing.google.com/advancedprotection/) Google Account Level Enhanced Safe\nBrowsing and ensure that all devices are updated. Additionally, our CyberCrime Investigation\nGroup is sharing relevant details and indicators with law enforcement.\n\n\n-----\n\nTAG is committed to sharing our findings as a way of raising awareness with the security\ncommunity, and with companies and individuals that might have been targeted. We hope that\nimproved understanding of the tactics and techniques will enhance threat hunting capability\nand lead to stronger user protections across the industry.\n\n_With contributions from Winnona DeSombre_\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n**UAE hack-for-hire Group Domains:**\n\nmyproject-login[.]shop\nmysite-log[.]shop\nsupp-help[.]me\naccount-noreply3[.]xyz\ngoolge[.]ltd\ngoolge[.]help\naccount-noreply8[.]info\naccount-server[.]xyz\nkcynvd-mail[.]com\nmail-goolge[.]com\nkcynve-mail[.]com\n\n**Indian hack-for-hire Group Domains:**\n\ndtiwa.app[.]link\nshare-team.app[.]link\nmipim.app[.]link\nprocesss.app[.]link\naws-amazon.app[.]ink\nclik[.]sbs\nloading[.]sbs\nuserprofile[.]live\nrequestservice[.]live\nunt-log[.]com\nwebtech-portal[.]com\nid-apl[.]info\nrnanage-icloud[.]com\napl[.]onl\ngo-gl[.]io\n\n**Russian hack-for-hire Group Domains:**\n\nlogin-my-oauth-mail[.]ru\n\n\n-----\n\noauth-login-accounts-mail[.]ru\nmy-oauth-accounts-mail[.]ru\nlogin-cloud-myaccount-mail[.]ru\nmyaccounts-auth[.]ru\nsecurity-my-account[.]ru\nsource-place-preference[.]ru\nsafe-place-smartlink[.]ru\nsafe-place-experience[.]ru\npreference-community-place[.]ru\n\nPOSTED IN:\n\n[Threat Analysis Group](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/%20)\n\n\n-----",
