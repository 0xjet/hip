That\nDLL is a RedLine stealer payload that connects to the command-and-control server via TCP\nto get instructions on what malicious tasks it has to run next on the newly compromised\nsystem.\n\n\n-----\n\n_RedLine execution and loading chain (HP)_\n\n## Outlook\n\nAlthough the distribution site is down now, nothing stops the actors from setting up a new\ndomain and restarting their campaign. In fact, this is very likely already happening in the wild.\n\nWindows 11 is a major upgrade that many Windows 10 users cannot get from the official\ndistribution channels due to hardware incompatibilities, something that malware operators\nsee as an excellent opportunity for finding new victims.\n\nAs BleepingComputer reported in January, threat actors are also leveraging Windows'\nlegitimate update clients to execute malicious code on compromised Windows systems, so\nthe tactics reported by HP are hardly surprising at this point.\n\nRemember, these dangerous sites are promoted via forum and social media posts or instant\nmessages, so don’t trust anything but the official Windows upgrade system alerts.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Microsoft adds Office subscriptions to Windows 11 account settings](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-adds-office-subscriptions-to-windows-11-account-settings/)\n\n[Sophos antivirus driver caused BSODs after Windows KB5013943 update](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/software/sophos-antivirus-driver-caused-bsods-after-windows-kb5013943-update/)\n\n[Windows admins frustrated by Quick Assist moving to Microsoft Store](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/windows-admins-frustrated-by-quick-assist-moving-to-microsoft-store/)\n\n[Microsoft: Sysrv botnet targets Windows, Linux servers with new exploits](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-sysrv-botnet-targets-windows-linux-servers-with-new-exploits/)\n\n[New cryptomining malware builds an army of Windows, Linux bots](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-cryptomining-malware-builds-an-army-of-windows-linux-bots/)\n\n[Bill Toulas](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/bill-toulas/)\n\n\n-----\n\nBill Toulas is a technology writer and infosec news reporter with over a decade of experience\nworking on various online publications.
