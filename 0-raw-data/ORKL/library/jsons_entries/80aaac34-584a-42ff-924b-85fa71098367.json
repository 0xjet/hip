None of them include source code for malware. Instead, they contain images of source code\nof unknown origins, images of command and control server backends, and images listing past hacked victims.\n\n[Multiple cyber-security firms, such as Chronicle, FireEye, and Palo Alto Networks, confirmed the authenticity of this first leak. Security](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/behind-the-scenes-with-oilrig/)\n[researchers from ClearSky Security and Minerva Labs have confirmed this last batch.](https://twitter.com/GelosSnake/status/1124386041736105984)\n\nWith two additional leaks hitting the airwaves, the theory that we are witnessing a well-orchestrated campaign to expose Iran's hacking\noperations looks now more valid than ever.\n\nThe perpetrators may be hoping that the political fallout from exposing Iran's hacks would damage the country's relations with neighbors,\nforeign political allies, and private sector companies that may rethink their operations and relations with the Iranian government.\n\n### MuddyWater leak\n\nThis was the second leak to emerge in the public eye after the Lab Dookhtegam leak that occurred on Telegram last month. A group calling\nthemselves the Green Leakers took responsabillity.\n\nThe group still operates two Telegram channels and two different Dark Web portals where they are selling data they claim is from the\noperations of the MuddyWater APT (APT = advanced persistent threat, a name used to describe government-backed hacking groups).\n\n\n-----\n\nIran MuddyWaters dark web\n\n\nImage: ZDNet\n\n\n-----\n\nIran MuddyWaters on Telegram\n\n\nImage: ZDNet\nBecause this data was put up for sale, the leakers did not release any tools for free, like Lab Dookhtegam in the first leak. Instead, they posted:\n\n- images showing the source code of a command and control (C&C) server used by the MuddyWater APT'\n\n- images of MuddyWater C&C server backends --which also included unredacted IP addresses of some of MuddyWater's victims.\n\n\n-----\n\nIran Rana C&C backend leak\n\n\nImage: ZDNet\nBecause the leakers have revealed only a small sample of data in the form of screenshots, the jury is still out on the authenticity of this leak;\nhowever, it cannot be discounted for the time being.\n\nBoth ZDNet and Minerva Labs have been keeping an eye on this leak for new developments, but besides having the Telegram channels\nsuspended and having to create new ones, nothing new has been shared for a few days now.\n\n### Rana Institute leak\n\nThe third leak involving data of Iranian cyber-operations, which ZDNet has been tracking for almost a week, occurred on a website on the\npublic Internet written in Persian and on a Telegram channel.\n\nThe leakers dumped small snippets from documents labeled \"secret\" that appeared to have originated with the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence\nand which described the Rana Institute, a contractor hired for cyber-espionage operations.\n\n\n-----\n\nU e t e a eged uddy ate ea, t s o e as bee e ed by secu ty esea c e s t C ea S y Secu ty, so e o t e ead g e pe ts\nIranian hacking operations.\n\nThe leaked documents are a treasure trove of threat intelligence for APT researchers, and expose the activities of a new group whose\nactivities have never been described or even spotted until today, despite being active since 2015.\n\n\"These documents contain lists of victims, cyber-attack strategies, alleged areas of access, a list of employees, and screenshots from internal\n[websites relevant to espionage systems,\" ClearSky said in a report published a few hours ago.](https://www.clearskysec.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Iranian-Nation-State-APT-Leak-Analysis-and-Overview.pdf)\n\n\"The documents shed light on some aspects of the group's activity, notably: tracking Iranians, tracking Iranian citizens outside of Iran, and the\ngroup's members.\"\n\n\nIran Rana leak on the clear web\n\n\nImage: ZDNet\n\n\n-----\n\ne ebs te e e ost o t e a a ea as pub s ed co ta ed t e pe so a deta s o a a st tute e be s, a o g t a s e o\ninformation about past campaigns --most of which focused on hacking airlines to retrieve passenger manifests, and hacking travel booking\nsites to retrieve reservations and payment card numbers.\n\nBut in addition to airlines and booking sites, the group also targeted insurance, IT, and telecom firms, as well as government agencies and\ndepartments from all over the world.\n\n\nIran Rana target countries\n\n\nImage: ClearSky Security\nPer the leaked documents, the Rana hackers were also asked to develop malware, with the most notable project that was assigned to their\nteam being of developing malware capable of damaging SCADA industrial control systems --similar to Stuxnet or Shamoon.\n\n\"The project was unsuccessful and did not achieve its goals despite a large budget,\" ClearSky researchers said.\n\n### Achieving their goals\n\n\n-----\n\ny e pos g t e a a g oup, t appea s t at t e ea e s oe e t ey a e a e ac e g t e goa o sabotag g a s cybe esp o age\noperations.\n\nWith hacking tools out in the open and with past campaigns exposed to the whole world, Iran's hacking groups will have to re-tool and focus on\nnew campaigns going forward, potentially delaying any current or planned hacking efforts --exactly what the leakers may have wanted.\n\n**Data leaks: The most common sources**\n\n### Related cybersecurity coverage:\n\n\n-----",
