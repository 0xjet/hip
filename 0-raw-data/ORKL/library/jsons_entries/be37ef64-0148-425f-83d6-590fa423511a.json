It is fully functional on Windows, and partially functional on OS\nX and Linux. This trojan is currently considered low risk as it is not known to have infected\nusers, and it does not run without root permissions. Jacksbot has the usual backdoor\nfunctionality, including the following capabilities:\n\ngathering system information\ntaking screenshots\nperforming denial of service attacks\ndeleting files\nstealing passwords (including specifically Minecraft passwords)\nvisiting remote URLs, likely to perform Clickfraud\n\n\n-----\n\n_This code is looking for Minecraft passwords._\n\nIt appears likely that this trojan is intended to be dropped by another component that has not\nyet been identified. The present component will exit with an error message if the Java\narchive is not run with root permissions. There is also no functionality to trick the user into\nrunning the file. We will post additional information about the threat as more is discovered.\n\n[Intego VirusBarrier users with up-to-date virus definitions are protected from this threat,](https://www.intego.com/virusbarrier)\nwhich is detected as Java/Jacksbot.A.\n\n\n-----",
