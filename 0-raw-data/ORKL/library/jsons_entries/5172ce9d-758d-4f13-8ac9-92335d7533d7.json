In this article, we’ll explore the use of\ndeploying one version of an app to gain the Play Store’s\n“trust” before issuing a malicious update of that same\napplication. Campaigns using versioning commonly\ntarget users’ credentials, data, and finances. In an\nenterprise environment, versioning demonstrates a need\nfor defense-in-depth principles, including but not limited\nto limiting application installation sources to trusted\nsources such as Google Play or managing corporate\ndevices via a mobile device management (MDM)\nplatform.\n\n### Evading Detection through Versioning\n\nWe thoroughly evaluate apps on the Google Play Store\n[and estimate that less than 1% of all downloads from](https://transparencyreport.google.com/android-security/store-app-safety)\n\n\nGoogle Play are Potentially Harmful Applications (PHAs).\nWhen Google Play identifies indications of malicious\nfunctionality in applications, we take appropriate\nenforcement actions that may include removal of apps\nand termination of developer accounts.\n\nOne way malicious actors attempt to circumvent\nGoogle Play’s security controls is through versioning.\nVersioning occurs when a developer releases an\ninitial version of an app on the Google Play Store that\nappears legitimate and passes our checks, but later\nreceives an update from a third-party server changing\nthe code on the end user device that enables\nmalicious activity.\n\nOne common form of versioning is using dynamic\ncode loading (DCL). DCL is defined as an app which\ndownloads and loads code files from untrusted\nsources.\n\n6\n\n\n-----\n\n**[For more information, visit gcat.google.com](http://gcat.google.com)**\n\n###### (Mobile Apps Evading Cloud Enterprise Detection, cont’d.)\n\n_An app distributed via Google Play may not modify, replace, or update itself using any method other than_\n_Google Play’s update mechanism. Likewise, an app may not download executable code (for example, dex,_\n_JAR, .so files) from a source other than Google Play._\n[Play Policy Center](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9888379?hl=en#:~:text=An%20app%20distributed%20via%20Google,source%20other%20than%20Google%20Play.)\n\n[Apps engaging in DCL violate Google Play Deceptive Behavior policy and may be categorized as a backdoor.](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9888077?visit_id=638200273350597826-1646989331&rd=1)\n\n**Malicious Patch**\n\n**Attacker Infrastructure**\n\n**• Base app not**\n\n**Patches** **detected as PHA**\n\n**DCL**\n\n**• Patches delivered**\n\n**Download**\n\n**through Play Store**\n\n**and Update**\n\n**not detected as PHA**\n\n\n**Attacker**\n\n**Dev**\n**Community**\n\n\n\n**• Enterprise-specific**\n**Play Store policy**\n**permits app installation**\n\n**• DCL avoids Play Store**\n**based detection.**\n\n\n**Play Store**\n**Enterprise Policy**\n\n**Fig 1. DCL circumvention of Play Store based security controls to patch malicious behaviors into already-installed applications.**\n\n\n7\n\n\n-----\n\n**[For more information, visit gcat.google.com](http://gcat.google.com)**\n\n\n###### (Mobile Apps Evading Cloud Enterprise Detection, cont’d.)\n\n\nGoogle conducts rigorous PHA screening on\napplications and their patches through the Play Store;\nhowever, DCL circumvents some of those controls. For\nenterprise environments, the most reliable detection\nof this type of attack rests in the enterprise policy\nand configurations (through tooling such as Android\nEnterprise, as detailed in the mitigations section)\nwhere the DCL delivery can be detected or the\nresultant malicious behavior post-update.\n\n### Malware: Sharkbot\n\n[DCL (aka MITRE T1407) enables attackers to download](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1407/)\nand execute code not included in the original\napplication after installation. The technique enables an\nattacker to evade static analysis and pre-publication\nchecks by the Google Play Store.\n\nOne well-known malware variant using this technique\nis SharkBot. SharkBot is a banking malware that\ninitiates money transfers from compromised devices\nusing the Automated Transfer Service (ATS) protocol.\nThe variants of SharkBot that appeared on Google\nPlay had reduced functionality, a common tactic threat\nactors use to help their apps look less suspicious to\nPlay Store detection systems. Once a user downloaded\nthe app, the app would download a full version of the\nmalware.\n\n### Mitigations\n\nIt takes a defense-in-depth approach to tackle\nthese issues:\n\n- The best way to avoid downloading malware to\nyour Android device is to make sure that you only\ninstall applications from trusted sources such as the\nGoogle Play Store. We continuously monitor apps in\n\n\nthe Play Store and seek to ensure that the apps are\nnot malicious or abusing the trust of our users. You\ncan learn more about the security of the Google\n[Play Store through our Transparency Report.](https://transparencyreport.google.com/android-security/store-app-safety)\nWe also recommend keeping your device’s software\nup-to-date.\n\n- For a holistic mobile device management solution,\n\n[Android Enterprise provides a suite of tools to](https://support.google.com/work/android/answer/6095397?ref_topic=6151012)\nmanage the distribution of devices and their\napplications across your enterprise. This can\nprovide increased visibility of device status and\nvaluable security monitoring capabilities. Whether\nyou choose a third party Enterprise Mobility\nManagement (EMM) solution or work with Google’s\nEndpoint Management, ensure that the relevant\nlogging can be monitored from centralized security\ntooling to layer both endpoint state and runtime\nsecurity monitoring. Whichever MDM you choose to\nimplement, ensure that it is kept up to date with the\nlatest detection rulesets in order to identify knownmalicious applications and behaviors.\n\n- [Application allowlists, as part of a custom](https://apps.google.com/supportwidget/articlehome?article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.google.com%2Fa%2Fanswer%2F6089179&assistant_id=generic-unu&product_context=6089179&product_name=UnuFlow&trigger_context=a)\nWorkspace Marketplace for your enterprise, can\nensure that only pre-approved applications can\nbe installed on enterprise devices. Whilst the\napplications on the allowlists may still be involved\nin DCL attacks, limiting the available applications to\nonly trusted developers may significantly reduce the\nlikelihood.\n\n- Especially in support of application allowlists,\nensure that the applications allowed are only from\nknown and reputable developers. If applications\nare required from less trusted sources, consider\nenforcing more strict supply chain monitoring and\ncontrols of those applications..\n\n8\n\n\n-----\n\n**[For more information, visit gcat.google.com](http://gcat.google.com)**\n\n## Identifying Compromised Customer Domains and IPs on Google Cloud\n\n\nWe encourage all Google Cloud customers to\nperiodically examine their domains and IPs for\nmalicious activity. Protecting online reputations –\navoiding “spam” and associated denylist-type of labels\n– will ensure uninterrupted online interactions with\nsuch assets.\n\nUsing 2022-23 VirusTotal and Mandiant data, we\ndiscovered 13 customer domains and one IP hosted\non Google Cloud that were compromised in Q1 2023[1].\nEach of the uncovered 13 websites had at least one\nmalicious file downloaded from it, while the one IP had\nbi-directional communications with external malware,\nusing ports above the well-known port range (i.e.\nnumbering 1024-65535).\n\n\nCustomers can mitigate such risks by using a variety of\ngovernance controls, including:\n\n- Installing endpoint protection tools, to prevent the\nstorage of malicious files;\n\n- Performing vulnerability scans on external and\ninternal cloud infrastructure to identify suspicious\nassets and rectify uncovered vulnerabilities;\n\n- Examining cloud logs and improving credential\nmanagement to identify and fix existing and original\nrisks that may have precipitated such compromises.\n\nCustomers can also use the new methodology\nwe discuss in this article to identify the unique\ncharacteristics of their compromised domains and IPs\nfor a more robust and focused mitigation.\n\n9\n\n\n-----\n\n###### (Compromised Customer Websites, cont’d.)\n\n##### Identifying Compromised Customer Assets\n\n**Compromised Domains**\n\nTo identify compromised domains, we searched\nVirusTotal for domains that had malware downloaded\nfrom them in Q1 2023[2]. We reduced this set to\ndomains hosted on Google Cloud IPs, and reduced\nfurther to domains that Mandiant classified as\nsuspicious or malicious. We finally reduced this result\n\n\n**[For more information, visit gcat.google.com](http://gcat.google.com)**\n\nset to domains likely belonging to Google Cloud\ncustomers. The below is an illustration from the\nVirusTotal UI of a general domain with malicious file\ndownloads associated with it. Of note, customers\ncan also analyze their own domains this way using\n[the VirusTotal UI and VirusTotal API. General VirusTotal](https://developers.virustotal.com/reference/overview)\n[API documentation and specific VirusTotal UI and API](https://developers.virustotal.com/reference/overview)\n[usage documentation can be used to examine such](https://blog.virustotal.com/2023/02/monitoring-infrastructure.html)\ndomains.\n\n\n_1 The VirusTotal and Mandiant data and analysis used in this article, is accessible to any regular user through standard customer-facing VirusTotal and Mandiant APIs._\n\n_2 In this article, “malware” identified by using VirusTotal is software having malicious “verdicts” issued by at least 5 VirusTotal anti-virus engines._\n\n\n10\n\n\n-----\n\n###### (Compromised Customer Websites, cont’d.)\n\n**Compromised IPs**\n\nWe also searched VirusTotal for malware\ncommunicating with IP addresses, which responded\nto such requests over ports greater than 1023. We\nwere looking for ‘dialogue’ between cloud instances\nand malware as opposed to for example port scans,\nor other potentially coincidental reasons why\nmalware might communicate with a particular IP.\nCommunicating above the well-known port range\nmakes for a possibly easier investigation, rather than\nexamining communications over well-known ports\nused by many services/users.\n\n\n**[For more information, visit gcat.google.com](http://gcat.google.com)**\n\nVirusTotal detonates malware submitted by users\nin sandboxes hosting Intrusion Detection Systems\n(IDSs) which monitor the sandboxes’ inbound\nand outbound traffic. We searched VirusTotal for\ntriggered IDS rules containing remote Google Cloud\nIP ‘source ports’ > 1023, indicating that Google Cloud\nIPs were responding to the sandboxed malware\nover registered/ephemeral ports. The example\nbelow illustrates a VirusTotal search result in which a\nmalicious file communicates with a general IP – which\nresponds to the malware on port 6606. (Customers\ncan also use the VirusTotal API to search across many\nmalware files potentially communicating with their IPs,\nand responding over ports > 1023).\n\nWe reduced our initial set of general IPs responding\nto malware to just responding Google Cloud IPs, and\nreduced the list further to just IPs Mandiant classified\nas suspicious/malicious, as well as to IPs belonging\nonly to Google Cloud clients.\n\n11\n\n\n-----\n\n**[For more information, visit gcat.google.com](http://gcat.google.com)**\n\n###### (Compromised Customer Websites, cont’d.)\n\n**Results**\n\nUltimately, we found 13 compromised domains likely belonging to Google Cloud customers and malware having\nbi-directional communications with one compromised customer-owned IP. After further analyzing these entities\nusing VirusTotal and Mandiant data, they could be characterized as follows:\n\n_13 domains_\n\n\n22 malicious files were downloaded from the 13 malicious domains. The files were characterized as:\n\n- Mandiant confirms that one of the downloaded files is the malware STORMKITTY\n\n- Almost half the files are for the Windows OS\n\n- The diverse files types include Rich Text Format, EXE, Javascript, HTML, Powershell, Text file, and Microsoft Word files\n\n\n13 domains Mandiant classified the 13 domains as:\n\n        - 1 suspect domain\n\n        - 12 malicious domains\n\n\nMandiant categorized the domains as (note: not all domains have\na categorization; and one domain can also have more than one\ncategorization):\n\n- “malware”: 4\n\n- “phishing”: 6\n\n- “malware/download location”: 3\n\n\nThe 13 domains were spread over 8 Google Cloud customer IPs\n\n\n_1 IP Address_\n\n\nMandiant classified the IP\nas malicious\n\n\n2 malicious files were communicating with the IP, and getting\nresponses over ports > 1023\n\n- VT characterized both files as MetasploitShellCode, and further\ncharacterized one file as CobaltStrike software\n\n\n12\n\n\n-----\n\n###### (Compromised Customer Websites, cont’d.)\n\n**Suggested Mitigations for Google Cloud Customers**\n\nWe recommend customers take the following actions\nto monitor and prevent such malicious activities in\ntheir environments.\n\n1. Configure endpoint protection tools to examine\nand remove malicious files and processes in their\ninstances.\n\n2. Investigate any malicious communications occurring\nover all ports (registered/ephemeral in particular,\nbut well-known as well). Malicious activity occurring\nin an instance can be identified by signing up and\n[using anomaly-detection tools like Event Threat](https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/concepts-event-threat-detection-overview)\n[Detection in Security Command Center Premium.](https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/concepts-event-threat-detection-overview)\nOverall, any open ports participating in suspect\ncommunications that don’t need to stay open\nshould be closed; and any involved software behind\nthe ports should be removed or re-configured, as\nrequired.\n\n3. Perform vulnerability scans; patching instance\nvulnerabilities in a timely fashion.\n\n4. Examine domains, IPs, and ports in VirusTotal and\nMandiant. From a defense in depth perspective, not\nall endpoint protection, intrusion detection, and/\nor other tools will detect all malware (e.g. malware\nsignatures may have not yet been updated in a\ngiven AV platform; file downloads may appear\ninconspicuous until broader context is associated\nwith them; etc). VirusTotal and Mandiant tooling\nprovide additional malicious activity identification,\nwhich other tools might occasionally miss.\n\n5. Malicious files can often be downloaded into or\ncommunicate with cloud infrastructure because\nof poor credential management (e.g. attackers\ncompromising weak instance passwords, and\n\n\n**[For more information, visit gcat.google.com](http://gcat.google.com)**\n\ninstalling malicious software in the instance; service\naccount credentials accidentally being uploaded\nto Github–permitting attackers scraping them to\nperform certain instance management with the\ncorresponding service account; etc. See article #1 in\nthis journal on general credential abuse statistics that\nunderpin Google Cloud instance compromises). To\nthis end–customers should strengthen their Identity\nand Access Management practices–such as enforcing\ncomplex passwords, and scanning their source code\nfor hardcoded credentials before checking it into\nrepos. More generally, customers can try to examine\nthe root cause of malware downloaded into their\nGoogle Cloud-hosted domains or having bidirectional\ncommunications with their Google Cloud IPs by using\n[Chronicle. Feeding their instance’s DNS resolution,](https://cloud.google.com/chronicle/docs/overview)\n[firewall, system activity and other Google Cloud logs](https://cloud.google.com/chronicle/docs/data-ingestion-flow)\ninto Chronicle, customers can explore Chronicle’s\nmerged data ‘views’ to look for infection vectors\nwhich possibly originally led to their compromised\nassets. If found, associated infrastructure gaps can be\nexamined, and relevant controls installed as required.\n\n[6. Use the Mandiant Digital Threat Monitoring (DTM)](https://www.mandiant.com/advantage/digital-threat-monitoring)\ntool, to identify any compromised domains and IPs.\nDTM tracks compromised online assets, as mentioned\nor resold in dark web channels. If customers identify\ntheir own assets with DTM, an incident response\nprocess should be launched to investigate and\nmitigate the associated threats.\n\n13\n\n\n-----\n\n**[For more information, visit gcat.google.com](http://gcat.google.com)**\n\n## Telecommunications Industry Profile: How Zero Trust with Cloud Adoption Can Help Mitigate Threats\n\n\n_This is the first article in a new series from our research_\n_and analysis team exploring the implications of_\n_cloud services adoption and security across various_\n_industries.

Source: Google Security Blog.](https://security.googleblog.com/2021/12/understanding-impact-of-apache-log4j.html)**\n\n[Among the threats highlighted are dependencies and during the Apache Log4j vulnerabilities (1, 2), 17,000](https://osv.dev/vulnerability/GHSA-7rjr-3q55-vv33)\n[packages were impacted (as of December 2021) either as a direct or indirect dependency as depicted in Figure](https://security.googleblog.com/2021/12/understanding-impact-of-apache-log4j.html)\n[2. These vulnerabilities and an Executive Order led to the emergence of a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) – an](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/)\ninventory of software in the codebase which helps organizations reduce their risk and secure their software.\nWhile thinking of dependencies like a tree structure is easier to understand, in reality, the relationship is more\ncomplicated, as illustrated in Figure 3 with an example from the javascript framework Express 4.18.2 dependencies\n(gray colored nodes) interrelated and represented on a graph. When available, organizations should review\nand regularly audit the SBOM of third-party software or services to assure they are not at risk for any critical\nvulnerabilities.\n\n**Figure 3.

Organizations can create their own artifacts\nor use those provided by other organizations and\nthe community. There are various public artifact\nregistries available as well as each of the major Cloud\nService Providers (CSPs) offering a managed artifact\nrepository.\n\n[Research from SysDig uncovered 1,652 malicious](https://sysdig.com/blog/analysis-of-supply-chain-attacks-through-public-docker-images/)\n[images on Docker Hub, the world’s largest artifact](https://sysdig.com/blog/analysis-of-supply-chain-attacks-through-public-docker-images/)\nrepository, where the most common types were\ncryptomining images followed by embedded secrets\nsuch as SSH or API keys allowing attackers to gain\naccess to containers once deployed. There were also\ninstances of typosquatting masquerading as legitimate\nsoftware such as ubuntu, golang, and drupal. These\nmalicious images can impact customers in various\nways such as increased cloud costs due to utilization\nfrom cryptomining to data loss from exfil and leaked\ncredentials.\n\n### Cloud Marketplaces\n\nCSPs also offer marketplaces that host containers,\nVM images, Software as a service (SaaS) applications,\nand more. In the case of Google Cloud, customers\nare billed from one central location and containers\nand VMs are distributed from Google-managed\ninfrastructure. Google scans VMs and containers for\nvulnerabilities however once deployed in a customer’s\nenvironment, it is the responsibility of the customer to\ncontinue scanning for vulnerabilities which highlights\nthe importance of vulnerability management.\n\n\nIn the case of managed SaaS services, under the\n[shared responsibility model customers are responsible](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/framework/security/shared-responsibility-shared-fate#shared_responsibility)\nfor access controls and the data shared with thirdparty applications. Some of these SaaS offerings are\nmulti-cloud management tools that can help monitor,\nmanage, and optimize cloud resources and operate\nby customers granting the tool access to their cloud\nenvironment with the use of IAM permissions and\nservice accounts. Though many follow the principle\nof least privilege and some only require read-only\naccess, there is still an inherent risk that bad actors\nmay target these third-party services which have been\ngranted persistent access to an organization’s cloud\nenvironment.\n\n### Managed Service Providers (MSPs)\n\nMSPs allow organizations to outsource their\ninformation technology (IT) to third parties to actively\nmanage the day to day services such as infrastructure\nor security. These relationships often require privileged\naccess and network connectivity to their customers.\n\nThere are several instances where attackers have\ngained access to organizations through MSPs\nexploiting the trusted relationship that is often\nscrutinized less than other methods defenders are\n[monitoring. The U.S. and other nations released a joint](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa22-131a)\n[advisory specifically about these threats to MSPs and](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa22-131a)\nimpact to their customers. Two well known examples\nof this include the SolarWinds and Kaseya breaches.\n[Mandiant attributed the SolarWinds compromise](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/unc2452-merged-into-apt29)\nfrom December 2020 to APT29, a Russia-based\nespionage group, and noted “Since 2020, APT29\nincreasingly sought to exploit trust relationships\nbetween customers and third parties“. Over 18,000\n\n26\n\n\n-----\n\n**[For more information, visit gcat.google.com](http://gcat.google.com)**\n\n###### (Leveraging third-party services while reducing risk, cont’d.)\n\norganizations were impacted with the trojan in\nSolarWinds Orion software. Kaseya was attacked\nby the REvil ransomware operators and in a press\n[release noted that only 50 customers were impacted](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/07/06/2257884/0/en/Kaseya-Responds-Swiftly-to-Sophisticated-Cyberattack-Mitigating-Global-Disruption-to-Customers.html)\nby the cyberattack, however given that most of their\ncustomers are MSPs, this resulted in 800 to 1,500\norganizations being impacted.\n\n### OAuth Apps\n\n\nOther prevalent distribution channels for extending\nfunctionality are browser extensions and OAuth\napps – both of which require end user consent and\npresent granularly scoped permissions. One of the\nmethods OAuth apps are distributed are through\nmarketplaces such as Google Workspace Marketplace\nand Microsoft’s AppSource however the apps can also\nbe distributed and installed outside of marketplaces.\n[The apps on the Workspace Marketplace use OAuth](https://workspace.google.com/marketplace)\nscopes to grant granular access to an end-user’s\naccount once they’ve consented by the user or a\nWorkspace administrator deploying an app for its\ndomain users. Figure 4 is an example of a Google\nWorkspace app with ~1M installs and the associated\npermissions it requires. This particular app requests\n[restricted scopes which would require additional](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/production-readiness/restricted-scope-verification#security-assessment)\n[verification by Google and an independent security](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/production-readiness/restricted-scope-verification#security-assessment)\nassessment of the application before publication.\n\n\n**Figure 4. Example of permissions from the OAuth application**\n**[Folgo for Google Drive with ~1M installs. Source: Google](https://workspace.google.com/marketplace)**\n**[Workspace Marketplace.](https://workspace.google.com/marketplace)**\n\n\n27\n\n\n-----\n\n**[For more information, visit gcat.google.com](http://gcat.google.com)**\n\n###### (Leveraging third-party services while reducing risk, cont’d.)\n\n\nOne of the most prominent examples of OAuth\n[abuse was described in Mandiant’s M-Trends 2017](https://www2.fireeye.com/rs/848-DID-242/images/RPT-M-Trends-2017.pdf)\nreport regarding the 2016 presidential election, where\nattackers created a malicious OAuth app called “Google\nScanner.” Attackers sent phishing emails with a link to\nregister the app, and once the user consented, the\nattackers had access to the user’s emails in Gmail and\nfiles in Google Drive. This risk has since been mitigated\nwith the additional verification process linked above\nthat triggers when restricted scopes are requested.\n\nA more recent example of how OAuth apps could be\nleveraged to attack organizations includes a recently\n[fixed bug dubbed GhostToken where researchers](https://astrix.security/ghosttoken-exploiting-gcp-application-infrastructure-to-create-invisible-unremovable-trojan-app-on-google-accounts/)\ndemonstrated how an attacker could make an invisible\nand unremovable OAuth app by repeating a process of\ndeleting and restoring a Google Cloud project hosting\nthe OAuth app. However, depending on the scopes\nrequested, apps that have not been verified and\nreviewed by Google would present end-users with an\n[unverified app warning prior to consent.](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/7454865)\n\nOAuth applications can request single access tokens\n[or persistent refresh tokens, which can allow an app to](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/bps-for-mitigating-gcloud-oauth-tokens#how_an_attacker_can_use_compromised_oauth_tokens)\nbypass multi-factor authentication. The default Google\nWorkspace setting for enterprise accounts is to allow\nusers to install any app available in the Marketplace\n– however, depending on the scope requested (nonsensitive, sensitive, and restricted), Google enforces\ndifferent requirements to protect users and reduce the\nrisk of malicious apps in the Marketplace. For instance,\nthe ability to read all Google Drive files or emails in\nGmail (restricted scope) triggers a more rigorous\nreview and approval process for developers, including\n[a software security assessment with over 70 controls.](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/9110914#sec-assess&zippy=%2Csecurity-assessment)\nAdditionally, app developers can opt into the highest\ntier of independent security reviews to earn a userfacing badge.\n\n\n### Browser Extensions\n\nPublic browser extensions are another example of\nthird-party resources that can get integrated into\norganizations’ environments. Extensions are usually\ndistributed from online marketplaces however many\nbrowsers, including Chromium based ones, also allow\nusers to manually download and side-load extensions\n(CRX files). Extensions can be granted various\npermissions such as the following with an example\nscreenshot in Figure 5:\n\n- Read and change all your data on all websites\n\n- Read and modify data you copy and paste\n\n- Capture content of your screen\n\n- Read your browsing history\n\n**Figure 5. Example of a Chrome extension, MetaMask, and**\n**[associated permissions.

When installed,\nthe extension would look for information from gift\nbalance-related websites that users visited, such\nas Target and Nordstrom, and capture the gift card\nnumbers.\n\n### Integrated Development Environment (IDE) Extensions\n\nRecently, bad actors were also observed injecting\nmalicious code into IDE extensions. Checkpoint\nrecently identified VS Code extensions that were\n[stealing PII and enabling backdoors, and Aqua even](https://blog.checkpoint.com/securing-the-cloud/malicious-vscode-extensions-with-more-than-45k-downloads-steal-pii-and-enable-backdoors/)\ndeployed a proof of concept extension into the VS\n[Code marketplace which was downloaded over](https://blog.aquasec.com/can-you-trust-your-vscode-extensions)\n[1,000 times within 48 hours masquerading as another](https://blog.aquasec.com/can-you-trust-your-vscode-extensions)\npopular extension.\n\nWhen evaluating third-party resources, organizations\nare encouraged to perform vendor security audits –\nincluding partnering with privacy and legal teams to\nreview privacy policies and terms of service. When\ncontrols are available, organizations should exercise\nenforcing policies – such as the case in Chrome\nEnterprise and Google Workspace – and continually\nmonitor and audit the usage of third-party apps and\nservices to ensure the supply chain has not been\ncompromised prior to reaching its intended consumer\nor after trust has been established.\n\n\n### Mitigations\n\n##### Supply Chain Threats\n\nGoogle, Mandiant, and the security community have\nreleased various resources organizations can leverage\nto help secure their software supply chains which\ninclude:\n\n- [Open Source Insights provides an accurate view of](https://deps.dev/)\nthe complete dependency graph with information\nabout security vulnerabilities, licenses, recent\nreleases, and more.\n\n[• Google Cloud published a software supply chain](https://cloud.google.com/software-supply-chain-security/docs/overview)\n[security guide with links to additional resources and](https://cloud.google.com/software-supply-chain-security/docs/overview)\nCloud services to aid in security of the supply chain.\n\n- The US government released guidance through the\n\n[Enduring Security Framework, CISA’s Security-by-](https://media.defense.gov/2022/Sep/01/2003068942/-1/-1/0/ESF_SECURING_THE_SOFTWARE_SUPPLY_CHAIN_DEVELOPERS.PDF)\n[Design and -Default, and NIST’s Secure Software](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-04/principles_approaches_for_security-by-design-default_508_0.pdf)\n[Development Framework (SSDF).](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-218/final)\n\n[• Google’s Open source vulnerability database along](https://osv.dev/)\n[with Mandiant’s Vulnerability Intelligence provide a](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/enhanced-vulnerability-intelligence)\ncatalog of advisories to help organizations manage\nand prioritize vulnerabilities in their environments.\n\n- Google Cloud offers OS Vulnerability scanning\n[with VM Manager and Security Command Center](https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/concepts-vulnerabilities-findings#vm_manager)\nPremium.
