In the 2012 attacks, infected computers had their master boot\nrecords wiped and replaced with an image of a burning US flag. The latest attacks instead\nused a photo of the body of Alan Kurdi, the three year-old Syrian refugee who drowned in\nthe Mediterranean last year.\n\n### Carefully planned operation\n\nThe attackers appear to have done a significant amount of preparatory work for the\noperation. The malware was configured with passwords that appear to have been stolen\nfrom the targeted organizations and were likely used to allow the threat to spread across a\ntargeted organization’s network. How the attackers obtained the stolen credentials is\nunknown.\n\nThe malware had a default configuration that triggered the disk-wiping payload at 8:45pm\nlocal time on Thursday, November 17. The Saudi Arabian working week runs from Sunday\nto Thursday. It would appear that the attack was timed to occur after most staff had gone\n\n\n-----\n\nhome for the weekend in the hope of reducing the chance of discovery before maximum\ndamage could be caused.\n\n### How Shamoon works\n\nShamoon uses a number of components to infect computers. The first component is a\ndropper, which creates a service with the name ‘NtsSrv’ to remain persistent on the\ninfected computer. It spreads across a local network by copying itself on to other\ncomputers and will drop additional components to infected computers. The dropper comes\nin 32-bit and 64-bit versions. If the 32-bit dropper detects a 64-bit architecture, it will drop\nthe 64-bit version.\n\nThe second component is the wiper, which drops a third component, known as the Eldos\ndriver. This enables access to the hard disk directly from user-mode without the need of\nWindows APIs. The wiper uses the Eldos driver to overwrite the hard disk with the\naforementioned photos of the Syrian boy.\n\nThe final component is the reporter. This is responsible for handling communications with\na command and control (C&C) server operated by the attackers. It can download\nadditional binaries from the C&C server and change the pre-configured disk-wiping time if\ninstructed by the C&C server. It is also configured to send a report verifying that a disk has\nbeen wiped to the C&C server.\n\n### Back with a bang\n\nAlthough attacks involving destructive malware such as Shamoon are relatively rare, they\ncan be highly disruptive for the targeted organization, potentially knocking mission-critical\ncomputers offline.\n\nWhy Shamoon has suddenly returned again after four years is unknown. However, with its\nhighly destructive payload, it is clear that the attackers want their targets to sit up and take\nnotice.\n\n### Protection\n\nSymantec and Norton products protect against Shamoon with the following detections:\n\n**Antivirus**\n\n**Intrusion prevention system**\n\nStatistics\n\n\n-----\n\n0 Favorited\n\n1 Views\n\n0 Files\n\n0 Shares\n\n0 Downloads\n\n## Tags and Keywords\n\n Related Entries and Links\n\nNo Related Resource entered.\n\n\n-----",
