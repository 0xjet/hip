Viewed through typical models such as the\n[Lockheed-Martin Cyber Killchain, (shown below) network infrastructure observables factor](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/cyber/cyber-kill-chain.html)\ninto nearly every stage of the intrusion lifecycle as either a critical dependency or an\nenabling factor.\n\n\n-----\n\nYet while commonly referred to and almost universally present, network infrastructure\nobservables—specifically domain names and IP addresses—are also frequently derided as\natomic, minimally enriched items for defensive purposes. This paper will show that such a\nview is mistaken and misguided—but only if we expand our understanding of network\ninfrastructure observables and their characteristics.\n\nA thorough examination of network observables shows differentiation between minimally\nenriched indicators and composite objects which enable more in-depth understanding and\nanalysis. By adopting the latter view, a seemingly atomic object such as a domain name\nyields a number of linked observations, which enable further analysis and pivoting. By\nfollowing this methodology, defenders can use a relatively small set of observations to build\na robust picture of adversary tendencies and unearth additional campaigns and adversary\nobservations.\n\n## Indicators and Atomic Objects\n\n\n-----\n\nInformation security operations live through the ingestion, analysis, and disposition of\n[technical observations. Frequently called “indicators of compromise” (IOCs), these](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2013/12/openioc-series-investigating-indicators-compromise-iocs.html) [items](https://taosecurity.blogspot.com/2018/11/the-origin-of-term-indicators-of.html)\nare in theory [composite objects consisting of observations, descriptions, and metadata. Yet](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2014/03/investigating-indicators-compromise-iocs-part-ii.html)\nin practice, “IOC” refers to a [debased,](https://pylos.co/2018/05/16/indicators-and-network-defense/) [diminished version of the original concept. Rather](https://threatpost.com/misunderstanding-indicators-of-compromise/117560/)\nthan containing built-in contextuality, IOCs instead are reduced to mere observables in\nisolation: an IP address, a domain name, a hash value.\n\nWhile (debased) IOCs still drive much of everyday network security operations, they are\nincreasingly derided by analysts and industry representatives. Examples include calls to\n[emphasize adversary behaviors over specific technical observations for defense, or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMtq3-YEVxo)\n[theoretical constructs such as the Pyramid of Pain representing the “staying power” of](http://detect-respond.blogspot.com/2013/03/the-pyramid-of-pain.html)\ndifferent types of observations.\n\nWhile these arguments are generally correct and insightful for improving the practice of\ninformation security, such developments come with an implicit and often ignored cost. In the\nrush to embrace behavior-based, tactics-techniques-procedures (TTP) focused defense,\nthe value of indicators and their nature may be left behind.\n\nA more thorough understanding of just what exists within an indicator allows us to explore in\ngreater detail the nature and basis for that indicator’s existence. Just as an atom, while\nrepresenting the fundamental building block of matter, contains subatomic particles that\ndefine its characteristics, the same is true for bare indicators. With further analysis and\nenrichment, we can discover greater details and gain an improved understanding of these\nobservations.\n\n## Nature of Network Infrastructure\n\n\n-----\n\nNetwork infrastructure observables are those artifacts related to intrusion events or\nadversary activity linked to delivery, communication, control, and exfiltration among other\nitems. Although not exhaustive, examples of network infrastructure observables include\ndomain names, IP addresses, and SSL/TLS certificates. As shown below, these items are\ninterrelated as they pertain to different aspects of the same overall communication scheme:\nan IP hosts a domain that uses an SSL/TLS certificate to encrypt traffic.\n\nAt first glance, these items appear to be unitary, atomic indicators. As such, they would\nappear to require enrichment and context outside of themselves to have lasting, meaningful\nvalue for understanding adversary behaviors and tendencies. However, further investigation\nof these items indicates a more complex nature with multiple subcomponents and\ncharacteristics that identify these items, under proper analysis, as composite objects.\n\nAs shown in the updated image, infrastructure observables contain a wealth of data when\nproperly analyzed and observed. Extending the comparison to atoms made above, each\ntype of network observable effectively “breaks down” into a mixture of subcomponents.\nUnderstanding and analyzing these items, their relationships, and patterns of composition\nyields insights into adversary behaviors which extends and deepens the value of a “bare”\nnetwork indicator.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Domain Names\n\nA [domain name is a natural language, human-readable item designed as a reference to a](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/internet-domain-name)\nmachine-focused IP address hosting content online. While content or services can be\naccessed simply through an IP address, domains facilitate the process and allow for a\ncertain degree of “branding” or uniqueness through their name.\n\nThe domain itself is not a unitary object though. Rather, the domain consists of several\ncomponents or identifying metadata that can be used to “fingerprint” or gain further insight\ninto the domain’s nature or creation. In addition to any hosting information related to the\ndomain and its use, covered below, the following items represent characteristics of a\ndomain that analysts and defenders can leverage:\n\n**Domain Registrar: In order to create and take ownership of a domain, an individual**\n[or entity needs to work through a registrar to secure a domain through one of the](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/glossary/what-is-a-domain-name-registrar/)\n[registries managing the desired Top Level Domain (TLD - e.g., “.com”). Registrars](https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/registries/registries-en)\ndiffer widely in terms of pricing, client scrutiny, and other aspects. As a result of these\ncharacteristics and infrastructure preferences, threat actors may prefer or primarily\nleverage certain registrars over others for infrastructure creation.\n**Domain Registrant: Domains are created by a given registrant. While this**\ninformation was historically quite useful, as such information would include contact\nemail addresses and other information that could be used to fingerprint infrastructure\n[creation, the increasing adoption of privacy protection services and the impact of the](https://www.namecheap.com/security/what-is-domain-privacy-definition/)\nEuropean Union’s [General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) have](https://gdpr-info.eu/) [greatly restricted](https://www.icann.org/dataprotectionprivacy)\nsuch information at present. Nonetheless, commonality in privacy protection services\nacross registrations can still be used as a weak link to tie together various domains.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Name Server: Domain resolution to an IP address requires an authoritative name**\nserver in order to translate requests. Identifying name servers associated with\n[registration—especially specific authoritative servers—can reveal patterns of](https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/what-is-the-difference-between-authoritative-and-recursive-dns-nameservers)\ninfrastructure creation and adversary tendencies.\n**Domain Naming Theme or Convention: In** [one of my previous posts, I described](https://www.domaintools.com/resources/blog/extrapolating-adversary-intent-through-infrastructure?utm_campaign=analyzing-network-infrastructure-as-composite-objects&utm_source=Blog)\nhow actual domain name selection may be used to infer adversary intent as well as\nadversary tendencies. Threat actors must pick something for a domain name, whether\nthis is a randomly-generated string, an item matching a theme, or a name matching a\ntarget or campaign. Identifying these themes or conventions can be a surprisingly\nuseful mechanism to differentiate domain registrations and identify commonalities for\nan actor.\n\nThe totality of these above items defines a domain. Just as they are components that\nrepresent the domain, they are also items that can be used to search for similarly-structured\nor created infrastructure. For example, an adversary may consistently use the same\ncombination of name server, registrar, and registration privacy protection service that can\nenable pivoting and identification of additional adversary infrastructure.\n\nAs seen in the DomainTools Iris Investigate screenshot below, these items can be readily\nidentified and used for pivoting purposes.\n\n\n-----\n\n### IP Addresses\n\nIP addresses are the identifying schema for Internet Protocol (IP) traffic and are used to\ndesignate specific machines or servers to receive traffic. While domain names are not\nnecessary for network communication, IP addresses are required for IP-based\ncommunication. An active, communicating domain will always be paired with an IP address,\nwhile an IP address need not have a related domain to ensure communication between\nhosts.\n\nWhile IP addresses are one of the most commonly seen indicators in CTI reporting, just like\ndomains IP addresses hide multiple subcomponents that identify aspects of adversary\ntendencies and behaviors:\n\n**Hosting Provider: Adversaries need to find reasonably private, non-attributable**\nhosting for network infrastructure. Options include any of the major cloud service\nproviders from [Amazon Web Services to](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/) [DigitalOcean; smaller](https://www.digitalocean.com/about/) [virtual private server](https://searchservervirtualization.techtarget.com/definition/virtual-private-server)\n[(VPS) providers; or utilizing services such as CloudFlare to mask true hosting from](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/what-is-cloudflare/)\nmonitoring parties.\n**Hosting Location: In addition to hosting providers, threat actors also have a degree**\nof choice over hosting location. Cloud, VPS, and other providers typically own\ninfrastructure located in various countries. Adversaries can leverage location\nspecificity for purposes ranging from avoiding potential geographic-based traffic\nfiltering to taking advantage of the legal system of the hosting country to maximize\nprivacy or make defender investigations more difficult.\n**Server Type: Infrastructure still needs a system on which to run, and the choice of**\noperating system (OS) and version can also be used to fingerprint adversary\ntendencies. Threat actors can decide between various flavors of Linux to different\nversions of Windows for the underlying OS. Identifying particular tendencies—\nespecially when related to exposed system services, described below—can reveal\npatterns of activity that can be used to identify or disposition new infrastructure.\n**Server Services: To function as a command and control (C2) or other node, a server**\nmust listen on some service. The most direct and basic would be HTTP or HTTPS, in\nwhich case we as defenders can identify the web server type, version, and, in the\ncase of HTTPS, server SSL/TLS certificates (described further below). Identifying\nnon-standard or atypical services, especially for unique or custom C2 frameworks,\ncan further enable identification and tracking.\n\nTo illustrate the above concepts, the suspicious domain “adverting-cdn[.]com” is hosted on\na dedicated server at 213.252.246[.]23. Within DomainTools Iris Investigate, we can identify\nthe IP address, hosting provider, and hosting location:\n\n\n-----\n\n[Using an internet scanning and enumeration tool such as Shodan, we can further](https://www.shodan.io/)\ninvestigate the server to identify services and fingerprint the server’s OS:\n\nBased on the above, we can identify a suspicious-looking domain hosted using a specific\nservice in Lithuania, exposing HTTP and SSH as well as HTTP over TCP 8000, and\nallowing us to fingerprint the server as a Debian Linux machine. Using this information, we\ncould work to identify further infrastructure through both domain and server characteristics.\n\n### SSL/TLS Certificates\n\nFinally, adversaries (as well as most legitimate web services) frequently employ standard\n[encryption using the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or](https://www.digicert.com/ssl/) [Transport Layer Security (TLS)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/transport-layer-security-tls/)\nprotocols. While adversaries can certainly use custom encryption or encoding protocols for\ntraffic, the ubiquity of SSL/TLS-wrapped communications and the limited visibility into such\ncommunications for most organizations make the publicly-available standard both very\neffective and significantly cheap for threat actors to deploy.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs a form of [public key cryptography, SSL/TLS encryption depends upon certificates for](https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/deep-dive-end-end-encryption-how-do-public-key-encryption-systems-work)\nfunctionality. Certificates can be tracked through various data points, as they typically\nfeature identifying information related to the certificate owner, such as organization or\nlocation.\n\nCertificates can take a variety of forms from self-signed, untrusted items to certificates\n[created through free and unvetted services (such as Let’s Encrypt) or sources which](https://letsencrypt.org/about/)\nperform some degree of vetting when issuing them. While resulting metadata will vary\ndepending on the issuer and the certificate, there is a rich history in using certificate\ncharacteristics to track adversary behavior, such as legacy [APT28 or](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0007/) [Fancy Bear](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/who-is-fancy-bear/) certificate\nand infrastructure activity.\n\nLooking at the suspicious domain european-who[.]com, we discover a free certificate\n[associated with cPanel services. As such, there is limited data to pivot off of although we](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/service-configuration/manage-service-ssl-certificates/84/)\ncan note the limited certificate information and use of a free service to identify this as\npotentially suspicious, while the certificate hash value provides a way to track the use of this\nspecific item.\n\nEven though in this case we have limited information for direct pivoting, just identifying the\nuse of self-signed, built-in cPanel certificates can be used to differentiate and identify further\ninfrastructure discovered through domain- or IP-based analysis Identifying another network\n\n\n-----\n\nobject with similar domain or IP characteristics that also deploys similar SSL/TLS certificate\ncreation tendencies can allow us to link infrastructure and begin understanding adversary\nbehaviors.\n\n## Composite Details and Pivoting\n\nIn addition to pivoting within different types of infrastructure characteristics, as shown in the\ndiagram below, understanding of adversary infrastructure tendencies enables pivoting\nbetween items as well.\n\nIn this view, insight into domain creation can reveal infrastructure hosting tendencies, which\ncan be leveraged to identify additional domains. Or a persistent pattern in SSL/TLS\ncertificate creation yields additional domains which in turn map to additional infrastructure.\n\nHowever, while the discovery of new indicators is enticing and potentially useful for defense,\nthis represents an intermediate objective as part of a larger process. Instead of merely\nattempting to identify more IOCs, cyber threat intelligence (CTI) analysts should leverage\nthis work as a means to identify fundamental adversary tendencies which can be used to\ncontinuously identify and disclose infrastructure over time. Indicators will certainly be\nproduced through this work, but they represent an output of a more fundamental process of\nidentifying and observing ground-truth adversary behaviors in creating network\ninfrastructure.\n\n### Example: Late 2020 Ryuk Activity\n\nTo see an example of the above, we can look at the recent episode of Ryuk ransomware\nincidents across [multiple hospital and health care provider systems in the United States,](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/Ryuk-FBI-DHS-ransomware-healthcare/588019/)\n[linked to a group referred to as UNC1878 by information security company FireEye. While](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/10/kegtap-and-singlemalt-with-a-ransomware-chaser.html)\n[utilizing malware and droppers such as BazarLoader and](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/bazarloader-used-to-deploy-ryuk-ransomware-on-high-value-targets/) [BazarBackdoor, Ryuk deployers](https://threatpost.com/trickbot-bazarbackdoor-malware-arsenal/156243/)\nstill required C2 infrastructure to control and further expand infections in victim\n\n\n-----\n\n[environments. Based on information released by FireEye and Kyle Ehmke from](https://twitter.com/kyleehmke)\n[ThreatConnect, and confirmed by multiple additional parties, the UNC1878 network](https://threatconnect.com/)\ninfrastructure activity encompassed several hundred domains created from summer 2020\n[through October 2020. (Please see the linked file for IOCs.)](https://gist.github.com/joeslowik/c925b31f29841f6dac9a2b6ec321d796)\n\nWhile seemingly overwhelming, the above domains contained a number of commonalities:\n\n1. Similar registration patterns used over time.\n2. Preference for a limited number of hosting providers.\n3. Consistency in SSL/TLS certificate characteristics.\n\nFor example UNC1878-linked domain “drive-boost[.]com” features the following\ncharacteristics:\n\nBreaking these observables down, we see the following:\n\nUse of consistent naming “theme” reflecting IT-related concepts or items (e.g.,\n“driver”).\n\n\n-----\n\nUse of the Namecheap registrar.\nConsistent use of WhoisGuard privacy protection service.\nConsistent use of registrar-servers[.]com DNS server.\n\nWhile the above items individually are quite common, taken together they allow us to begin\nfiltering likely related items. Looking at hosting ISP patterns, shown above in a DomainTools\nIris Investigate visualization, reveals additional characteristics—namely four distinct “waves”\nor series of activity centered around the following providers:\n\nPrivate Layer Inc., located in Switzerland.\nPsychz Networks, located in the United States.\nFrantech Solutions, located in the United States.\nCombahton GmbH, located in Germany.\n\n\n-----\n\nNow we have a better way of clustering known activity, and potentially identifying new,\nsimilar items. But even further options exist within a subset of domains that feature an\nexisting SSL/TLS certificate. For example, looking at “driver-boosters[.]com” shows the\nfollowing certificate information:\n\nIn this case, we see a certificate pattern using a Locality Name of “Texas” and an\nOrganization Name of “lol” for a self-signed certificate. Diving into certificate information\nyields over 100 items which, when looked at in conjunction with other items documented\nabove, allows for high confidence attribution to UNC1878 activity.\n\nThrough this process, we have identified a set of characteristics denoting UNC1878\ninfrastructure. This can be used both for post-incident attribution to determine what entity\nmay be responsible for a breach. Additionally, such methodologies can be used through\ndatasets such as DomainTools and search tools such as Iris Investigate to proactively and\n\n\n-----\n\npreemptively identify infrastructure as it is created. In this fashion, CTI becomes more\nattuned to adversary tendencies and characteristics while also enabling more direct,\nproactive support to network defense operations through continuous identification of\nadversary infrastructure.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhile network infrastructure indicators and observables are typically viewed as atomic\nobjects, seeing these items as composites enables powerful analysis able to keep pace\nwith adversary evolution. By understanding the fundamental nature of items such as\ndomain names, IP addresses, and SSL/TLS certificates, analysts can begin understanding\nfundamental adversary tendencies and tradecraft. When done well, such actions enable\ndefenders to not only accurately disposition new infrastructure as it is discovered, but also\nto identify new infrastructure as it is created to boost defensive operations.\n\nWhile this process can be quite powerful in identifying and tracking adversary operations,\nwe must also note limitations to this methodology. For example, adversaries may leverage\ncompromised, legitimate infrastructure for communications and similar activity in order to\nhide their tracks and confuse analysis. This is an increasing trend for many threat actors,\nwhich can throw off analytical techniques such as those described above. However, even in\n\n\n-----\n\nthese cases, possibilities exist such as identifying underlying server or software\ncommonalities which may be indicative of a vulnerability exploited to gain access to the\nlegitimate server. These commonalities can enable similar types of pivoting to what was\ndiscussed previously with respect to adversary-owned-and-operated infrastructure.\n\nBy viewing indicators as not just isolated objects but as composites containing multiple\ncomponents that can be used to better understand the nature, purpose, and composition of\nthe indicator, CTI analysts can unlock a greater understanding of adversary operations.\nFurthermore, while this article is limited to network observables, the same fundamental\nconcepts are equally applicable to host and file-based indicators as well. By further refining,\nresearching, and enriching indicators, CTI analysts can continuously push the envelope of\nthreat understanding and threat detection, enabling both a better understanding of past\nevents and potential identification of new threat vectors from known adversaries as they\nemerge.\n\nTo learn how to identify and track adversary operations in DomainTools Iris Investigate, visit\nour product page.\n\n[Learn More](https://www.domaintools.com/products/iris/?utm_campaign=analyzing-network-infrastructure-as-composite-objects&utm_source=Blog)\n\n\n-----",
