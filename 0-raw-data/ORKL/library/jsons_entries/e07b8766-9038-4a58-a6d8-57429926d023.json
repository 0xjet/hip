Their operations\n\n                                    - Various reported Iranian social engineering attacks share\n\nappear to use many of the studied “principles of influence” and\n\napproaches, including recruitment offers, offers to solicit\n\noverlap with human intelligence (HUMINT) recruitment practices,\n\ntargets for journalistic purposes or political analysis,\n\nboth of which influence social engineering methodologies.\n\nromantic engagements, and supposed anti-government\n\nResearch on the Iranian government’s strategic and tactical activism.\napproaches to the offensive and defensive “Soft War” also\n\n                                   - The use of foreign languages and knowledge of foreign\n\nsuggests that social engineering is an indispensable element of\n\nsocieties and cultures will continue to play a central role\n\nthe government’s cyber capabilities, which it has relied on for\n\nin targeted social engineering attacks. Iranian APTs are\n\nat least a decade. Tehran views the ability for a foreign power\n\nimproving their command of major languages such as\n\nto incite domestic upheaval as being as dangerous as a military\n\nEnglish and major European, Middle Eastern, and South\n\nattack on its territory. Equally so, the ability to foment social\n\nAsian languages.\n\nunrest internationally is a capability at its disposal to attack\nits perceived enemies. Understanding and dissecting foreign\nsocieties, languages, cultures, and political systems has enabled\nTehran to leverage social engineering in ways comparable to\nRussian threat activity groups.\n\nLarge-scale social engineering campaigns have predominantly\nbeen executed by APT35, Tortoiseshell, and APT34, and their\nassociated sub-groups. While their operations do not diminish\nthose run by other advanced persistent threat groups (APTs),\nthese 3 Iran-nexus groups have depicted substantial tradecraft\noverlaps in how they target their victims. These include the\nuse of charismatic sock puppets, the lure of prospective job\nopportunities, solicitation by journalists, and masquerading as\nthink tank experts seeking opinions. These are just some of the\npersonas which these 3 Iranian APTs have continued to use\nsince the first major disclosure on Iranian social engineering —\nOperation Newscaster — was publicly reported in 2014.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Background\n\nThe growth of Iranian social engineering can be traced to\nIranian hacker forums, with many including sub-threads on the\ntechniques necessary to target unsuspecting victims. Some\nof the earliest examples include the “Simorgh Security Team”,\namong the first to differentiate social engineering from other\nhacking disciplines.[1] Members of that group claimed that a social\nengineer must be persuasive, articulate, and possess strong\nanalytical and intelligence gathering skills.\n\nSocial engineering, a component of Iran’s defensive and\noffensive cyber capabilities embedded in pro-government Iranian\ncyber doctrine, can be traced to institutionalized ideologies\n[such as the “Soft War” ( .)جنگ نرم](https://www.csis.org/analysis/united-states-soft-war-iran) The concept of Soft War was\n[established as far back as 2010 and aims to counter subversion,](https://jamestown.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/TM_008_44.pdf?x23987)\nor political, religious, economic, and cultural ideals that may lead\nto the destabilization and fall of the Islamic Republic. These goals\nare likely achieved by networks of trusted experts rooted deeply\nin Iran’s military and intelligence organizations.\n\nFor example, the commander of the Islamic Revolutionary\nGuard Corps (IRGC) in Kerman province (Sarullah Corps)\nrecognized the role of repatriating Iranian “elites” in countering\nenemy influence and disinformation campaigns,[2] declaring\nthem key in the struggle against “the disproportionate soft\nwar and psychological operations [PSYOPS] of the enemy”.\nIn this context, elites refer to highly educated Iranians close\nto the regime who have been directed to seek education and\nemployment opportunities abroad.\n\nThe IRGC and its auxiliary force the Basij, as well as the\nMinistry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS), have cemented their\nrole in the field to counter the Soft War since 2010; they have\nestablished multiple operational bases that, at least in name, are\ndedicated to the Soft War, such as the Baqiatallah al-Azam Social\nand Cultural Base ()قرارگاه بقیةاهلل االعظم .The Baqiatallah base is\ncurrently headed by the former commander of the IRGC, General\nMohammad Ali Jafari, who on this matter claimed in November\n2021 that the Islamic Republic’s enemies aimed to destroy it and\nthat “soft, cultural, and media wars” were harder to combat than\na kinetic war.[3]\n\n1 http[:]//www.webhostingtalk[.]ir/showthread.php?t=65453\n2 https[:]//www.tasnimnews[.]com/fa/news/1400/08/27/2610378/\n3 https[:]//www.isna[.]ir/news/1400081108669\n\n\nOpen source [analysis has referred to Tehran’s strategic](https://jamestown.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/TM_008_44.pdf?x23987)\nthreat perceptions within this space. As early as 2010, Iran\nviewed social media platforms as “elements of a cyber warfare\nthreat … particularly in the way rumors are spread online to\n‘stir up’ discord within Iran”, following its own threats to the\n[establishment that arose from the 2009 Green Movement. Iran](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/iran/2019-06-14/irans-green-movement-never-went-away)\nhas proven to strategically leverage the same threat calculus,\nalong with the other Big Four (Russia, China, and to a lesser\nextent North Korea) adversarial nations, against its adversaries,\nincluding the US government.\n\nOperationally, Iranian social engineering depicts a strong\nemphasis on the use of foreign languages and cultures to\nexecute defensive and offensive campaigns against domestic\nfoes, such as anti-revolutionary fronts like the Mojahedeen Khalq\nOrganization (MEK) and the National Council of Resistance of Iran\n(NCRI), and nations which Iran perceives to be its adversaries: the\nUS, the UK, Israel, and Saudi Arabia. Pro-government operators\nunderstand adversarial societies and cultures well enough to\nmimic them; this capability manifests, whether successful or not,\nin information operations, psyops, and cyber intrusions.\n\n#### Threat Analysis\n\nThe cases below outline several successful and unsuccessful\nsocial engineering attacks by Iranian operatives. Some cases are\nassociated with cyber intrusion or credential phishing operations,\nothers with influence and psychological operations. Most cases\nwere reported by cyber research groups such as ClearSky,\nCitizenLab, and Proofpoint. In some cases, anti-government\nreporting provided additional examples of social engineering\ntradecraft.\n\nThe reporting is also marked by the different naming\nconventions (cryptonyms) associated with Iranian APT groups.\nThese predominantly involve APT35, Tortoiseshell, and APT34,\nwhich are tracked by multiple industry vendors with different\ncryptonyms. These APTs also have their own subgroups, such\nas UNC788 and LYCEUM, which at times complicates attribution\nanalysis attempts. To simplify associations, we have included a\ndeconfliction table below.\n\nAs part of this research, we selected these 3 Iranian APT\ngroups due to various social engineering cases that have been\npublicly reported and their ability to provide insight on attack\ntradecraft.\n\n\n-----\n\nHelix Kitten (CrowdStrike), Cobalt Gypsy\n\nAPT34 (FireEye) (Secureworks), OilRig (PaloAlto), LYCEUM\n\n(Secureworks)\n\n_Table 1: APT cryptonym deconfliction table (Source: Recorded Future)_\n\n##### The Approach\n\nExtensive studies discuss social engineering tradecraft (that\n[is, persuasion principles) and its effects on human psychology.](https://doi.org/10.1002/jip.1482)\nThe principles considered to be key drivers are “authority”,\n“conformity”, “reciprocity”, “commitment”, “scarcity”, and “liking”\n(flattery). Applications from such studies are readily visible in\nthe Iranian social engineering approach. For example, in the\n[study, commitment is defined as the “likelihood of sticking to](https://doi.org/10.1002/jip.1482)\na cause or idea after making a promise or adhesion … which\nincreases the likelihood of compliance”. The process of liking\n“puts that person in a favourable position” where “People tend\nto like others who are similar in terms of interests, attitudes, and\nbeliefs”, while with reciprocity “the target feels indebted to the\nrequester for making a gesture and even the smallest gift puts\nthe requester in an advantageous position”.\n\nIranian methodologies apply many of these techniques to\ntheir attacks; some commence with a sense of authority and\ninfuse reciprocity, while others use flattery to hook the target\nbefore escalating to a commitment phase. Notably, the process of\ncommitment is observed among all of the threat actor interactions\nwith victims discussed in this report, with benign documents\nbeing shared to establish trust and initiate the psychological\nmechanism of compliance with an attacker’s request. Flattery,\nor the prospect of being courted by a charismatic persona or\nhigh-profile recruiter, is another common tactic, technique, and\nprocedure (TTP) used by various Iranian APTs.\n\n\nIn lesser cases, challenging conventional thought or making\nprovocative and factually inaccurate statements is a reverse\npsychology trick to draw in and engage a target. For example,\nIranian APTs may impersonate a news reporter or claim to be an\nexpert from a reputable think tank. Under this guise, they may\nstate something a target is likely to hold an opposing analytical\nview on in the hope of eliciting a response from the target. As\n[described by one reputed Iran analyst, this tactic was used in](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/05/20/how-iranian-hackers-tried-phish-me/)\nan attack which eventually aimed to have the target to proceed\nto a fake login portal where their credentials would be stolen:\n\n_The email from a prominent Israeli think tank_\n_offered some provocative suggestions on US_\n_policy towards China. “We must understand_\n_that China is at war with the United States”,_\n_[it declared, citing the covid-19 pandemic as](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/05/20/coronavirus-update-us/?itid=lk_inline_manual_3)_\n_evidence. Its authors recommended that the_\n_Trump administration set up a team of “top_\n_China experts” such as Stephen K. Bannon_\n_and former House speaker Newt Gingrich_\n_to confront “Red China” in the wake of the_\n_coronavirus crisis._\n\nWhen the target did not reply, the attackers chose to\nescalate, first, by sending a new email depicting spoofed\ncorrespondence in Hebrew from an analyst the target held a\nprofessional working relationship with. When the target again\ndid not respond, the attackers sent a new email impersonating\n“a president of a prominent Washington think tank offering his\ncritiques of the paper”.\n\n|APT|Industry Names|\n|---|---|\n|APT35 (FireEye)|Charming Kitten (CrowdStrike), Phosphorus (Microsoft), TA453 (Proofpoint), UNC788 (Mandiant/FireEye), ITG18 (IBM X-Force)|\n|Tortoiseshell (Symantec)|Imperial Kitten (CrowdStrike), TA456 (Proofpoint), Curium (Microsoft)|\n|APT34 (FireEye)|Helix Kitten (CrowdStrike), Cobalt Gypsy (Secureworks), OilRig (PaloAlto), LYCEUM (Secureworks)|\n\n|APT|Common Techniques|Col3|Col4|Col5|Col6|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|APT35|Soliciting Opinions (Journalistic or Other)|Enlist Immediate Action/ Google Recovery|Romantic Engagement|Greetings/ Seemingly Benign Engagements|Engaging Professional Counterpart|\n|Tortoiseshell|Romantic Engagement|Professional Opportunity||||\n|APT34|Romantic Engagement|Professional Opportunity|Online Survey|||\n\n\nUnattributed\n\nactivity\n\n\nElicit\nAssistance\n\n\nEngaging as\n\na Dissident\n\n\nProfessional\nOpportunity\n\n\nEngaging as a\nPolitical Activist\n\n\n-----\n\n_[Figure 1: Operation Newscaster fake personas and their social media presence (Source: iSight)](https://paper.seebug.org/papers/APT/APT_CyberCriminal_Campagin/2014/2014.05.28.NewsCaster_An_Iranian_Threat_Within_Social_Networks/file-2581720763-pdf.pdf)_\n\nThe examples listed in this report also correlate to some\npublicized HUMINT principles and agent recruitment techniques.\n[Following the MICE or RASCLS frameworks, the use of financial](https://www.cia.gov/resources/csi/studies-in-intelligence/volume-57-no-1/an-alternative-framework-for-agent-recruitment-from-mice-to-rascls/)\nrewards, or surreptitiously stimulating the target’s ego, have\nproven to be traits that many Iranian social engineering attacks\nhave adopted. The comparative study also suggests that target\nmanipulation reportedly depends on the “principles of influence\nand persuasion and they [recruitment case officers] have learned\nhow to manipulate without appearing to be manipulative”. A direct\nexample of this is the case of Mona Rahman from the Endless\nMayfly campaign, where the operators attempted to piggyback\non negative Saudi sentiment to recruit a social media audience\nto a physical protest.\n\n\n##### Social Engineering Components\n\nWhile Iranian social engineering attacks vary between\ngroups, and many use open source or bespoke malware, some\nobservable traits remain constant. The characteristics of Iranian\noperations focus on the theft of credentials, delivery of malicious\nprograms, or delivery of fake information as part of broader\ninfluence operations.\n\n##### Phishing for Credential Theft\n\nCredential theft is among the most prevalent and consistent\nelements of Iranian social engineering operations. For example,\nthe operators associated with Charming Kitten develop extensive\ninfrastructure networks to enable authentication-themed\ncredential theft activity. These domains mimic popular services\nsuch as Google, Hotmail, and Yahoo, as well as countless\nspoofed login portals associated with information technology\n(IT) and high-tech groups, telecommunications providers and\ninternet service providers (ISPs), private business, and public\noffices associated with multiple governments.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe authentication-themed domains discovered by Insikt\nGroup replicate much of the known tradecraft used by Charming\nKitten throughout 2021. Similar to the previous examples, the\noperators predominantly register domains using the .site, .online,\n.top, .mobi, .network, and .info Top Level Domains (TLDs). The\ndomains investigated are predominantly registered using the\nOnlineNIC or Namecheap service. Furthermore, in continuation\nwith its known TTPs, Insikt Group research revealed a continued\nreliance on OVH and Hetzner GmbH hosting providers.\n\n##### Strategic Web Compromise\n\nIn 2021, at least one Iranian social engineering campaign\nwas marked by strategic web compromise (SWC) activity to lead\nintrusion operations against their victims. The group responsible\n(see the TA453 campaign below) compromised a legitimate\nwebsite to steal credentials from targets.\n\n##### Malicious Applications\n\nMalicious applications form a component of the social\n[engineering threat. Industry research has reported throughout](https://securityintelligence.com/posts/itg18-operational-security-errors-plague-iranian-threat-group/)\n2021 that a malicious application they dubbed LittleLooter was\nused for attack operations. Another sample was detected and\n[reported by Google’s Threat Analysis Group in October 2021.](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/countering-threats-iran/)\nThe applications are used to target victims from various sectors\ninside and outside Iran. These applications are delivered to\nvictims via social engineering attacks, sometimes involving the\noperators directly engaging with victims.\n\n##### Malicious Documents\n\nAlmost every major social engineering campaign in this\nreport suggests that highly targeted operations revolve around\ndisseminating malicious documents to enable intrusions. The\nthreat actors have used both open source and bespoke malware,\nsuch as PupyRAT and LEMPO (LIDERC), respectively, to launch\nattacks.\n\n##### Fake News Outlets and Journalists\n\nSince the discovery of the [Newscaster network, Iranian](https://paper.seebug.org/papers/APT/APT_CyberCriminal_Campagin/2014/2014.05.28.NewsCaster_An_Iranian_Threat_Within_Social_Networks/file-2581720763-pdf.pdf)\nsocial engineering activities have revolved around the use\nof journalistic personas, malicious fake news websites (see\nAPT35 below), or the dissemination of disinformation to trick or\nmanipulate targets (see Influence Operations below). As noted\nin this report, Iranian operators have been identified on various\noccasions assuming the personas of journalists or activists when\nconducting intrusion or influence operations against targets.\nIranian influence operations have similarly been tracked and\n[disrupted by industry researchers, social media organizations,](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/report-suspected-iranian-influence-operation)\n[and the US government.](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/united-states-seizes-domain-names-used-iran-s-islamic-revolutionary-guard-corps)\n\n\n##### Charismatic Personas\n\nThe use of charismatic personas has been a formative\ncharacteristic of Iranian social engineering campaigns. Almost\nevery case discussed in this report refers to at least one\nfabricated profile used to target unsuspecting victims. In some\ncases, the profiles were so successful (see Mia Ash) that a\nvictim, potentially acting under the false illusion of a romantic\nengagement, provided their personal details to register domains\nused by the threat actor.\n\n##### Social Engineering Campaigns\n\n Phosphorus\n\nOn November 16, 2021, Microsoft’s Threat Intelligence Center\n[(MSTIC) outlined its observations of Iranian threat actor activity](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/11/16/evolving-trends-in-iranian-threat-actor-activity-mstic-presentation-at-cyberwarcon-2021/)\nwithout giving specific operational examples. Prime among the\ngroups MSTIC observed were Phosphorus and Curium. MSTIC\nreported that Phosphorus was increasingly devoting more\ntime to engage with its victims by sending benign questions\nand engaging in several “back-and-forth conversations” before\nsending an “interview request” with links masquerading as Google\nMeeting invites. Insikt Group has identified similar examples that\nfocused on the use of the IMO chat service (Figure 3).\n\nMSTIC analysis revealed that Phosphorus operators have\nbecome more aggressive with their targets, “almost demanding\na response”. On November 20 and 24, 2021, threat actors\nimpersonated a well-known New York Times Bureau Chief\nThomas Erdbrink, who has covered Iran, in an attempt to target a\ndissident activist, Mahsa Alimardani (Figure 3). While the MSTIC\ndisclosure is not likely related to the Erdbrink impersonation\nattempt, it highlights the group’s ongoing attempts to target\nits victims notwithstanding public disclosures against it.\nAdditionally, impersonating journalists is a well-reported tactic\nused by the operators associated with the Iran-nexus group\n(additional evidence in Appendix).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2: Typical social-engineering example of an email-led interview request (Source: social_\n_media)_\n\nA day after the MSTIC disclosure, the advocacy group\nUnited Against Nuclear Iran (UANI) [claimed cyber operators](https://www.iranintl.com/en/20211117594887)\nassociated with the Iran-nexus group targeted its organization.\nIt specifically claimed that “its leadership and members of its\nAdvisory Board’’ were targeted by the group by procuring “data\noutside of the public realm, [and] impersonated our leadership\nin communications with former senior officials of the US\ngovernment, and attempted to harvest Gmail credentials”. The\nimpersonation of stakeholders is, as noted throughout many of\nthe cases associated with the APT, a predominant characteristic\nof the APT group.\n\n_Figure 3: URLScan of a suspected Charming Kitten-linked domain identified by Insikt Group led to a_\n\n\n_[login page for IMO chat video (Source: URLScan)](https://urlscan.io/result/30eee832-6d8d-4cb0-91c1-3192abbe059d/#summary)_\n\nAccording to MSTIC, Curium, which highly likely overlaps\nwith Tortoiseshell, uses more long-term tradecraft. Curium\nengages via social media or professional networking accounts,\nand will exchange multiple benign files with the victim prior to\nsending a malicious document. The act of exchanging files and\nvisual content is, according to MSTIC, a process of lowering the\nvictim’s guard. Additional information and a well-known case are\ncited in the coverage of TA456 below. Again, throughout many\nof the reported social engineering examples, Iranian operators\nregularly interact with their victims. For strategic, long-term\ntargets, groups like Curium and APT34 have proven to attempt\nto establish trust and multiple attack vectors to ensure access\nto their victim.\n\n##### TA453\n\nThe threat actor tracked by Proofpoint, which it classifies as\nTA453, was highly active throughout 2020 and 2021. The group\nreleased 2 reports on their attempts to social engineer research\nprofessionals in the US, UK, and Israel during the reporting time\nframe. Between December 2020 and March 2021, the group was\ndetected launching spearphishing attacks against senior US and\nIsraeli researchers associated with the medical sciences sector\nin a campaign dubbed BadBlood. More specifically, the victims\nof the campaign worked in genetic, neurological, and oncological\nresearch. No live engagements with victims were reported;\nhowever, Proofpoint evidence suggests the operators spoofed\nthe persona of an Israeli physicist and used that as a front to\ntarget at least 25 other senior researchers in the US and Israel.\n\nThe lure used — a report on Israel’s nuclear capabilities — was\nbenign and unrelated to the medical sciences sector. Proofpoint\nclaimed the operators used known spearphishing techniques,\nsuch as sending emails with the purported assessment on Israel’s\nnuclear capabilities attached to them, to steal the victim’s email\ncredentials. It is unknown what follow-on activity transpired\nafter successful credential theft or whether the end goal was\nto penetrate the medical sector or use their access to victim\naccounts to target other members of their networks beyond\nmedical research.\n\n\n-----\n\nTA453 was detected again targeting senior researchers\nthroughout 2021 in an operation dubbed SpoofedScholars.\nAs part of this campaign, the threat actors masqueraded as\nscholars from the University of London’s School of Oriental and\nAfrican Studies (SOAS). The fake personas targeted experts in\nforeign policy, journalism, and academia that focused on Middle\nEast politics. The effort was reported as an attempt to garner\nstrategic insight on the possible effects of future relations vis-avis Tehran. This effort by TA453 operatives revealed that it was\ndriven to establish extensive relations with targets, communicate\nwith them, and then drive them to a conference registration link\nhosted on a compromised website. The compromised website\nbelonged to SOAS Radio, which likely contributed to appearing\nas a legitimate action.\n\n_[Figure 4: A fake invite sent to a victim of Operation SpoofedScholars (Source: Proofpoint)](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/operation-spoofedscholars-conversation-ta453)_\n\n##### TA456\n\nIn late July 2021, Proofpoint disclosed a campaign on TA456\n[called “I Knew You Were Trouble”. The campaign reported](https://www.proofpoint.com/au/blog/threat-insight/i-knew-you-were-trouble-ta456-targets-defense-contractor-alluring-social-media)\nby Proofpoint also overlapped with [Facebook’s own action,](https://about.fb.com/news/2021/07/taking-action-against-hackers-in-iran/)\nreported in mid-July 2021, against this threat actor group. The\nsocial engineering component is reported to have involved the\ncreation of a fictitious social media persona, “Marcella (Marcy)\n\n\nFlores”. The targets were US defense contractors operating\nin the Middle East and subcontractors associated with larger\ndefense companies. Facebook’s report highlighted the nature of\nthe likely connected broader campaign, which involved different\naccounts posing as “recruiters and employees of defense and\naerospace companies from the countries their targets were\nin...Other personas claimed to work in hospitality, medicine,\njournalism, NGOs and airlines”.\n\nThe persona is categorized as a traditional “honey trap”\noperation, where charisma and an attractive image are used to\n[entice unsuspecting targets. It is reported that honey traps are](https://cisomag.eccouncil.org/deloitte-hack-iranian-hackers-lured-firms-employee-via-facebook-honey-trap/)\na TTP historically used by Iranian threat actor groups to target\nenterprises.\n\nHoney traps are a historically common TTP used by Iranian\n[threat actor groups to target enterprises.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2017/10/05/facebook-fake-hacks-deloitte-employee-iran-cyber-spies-suspected/?sh=33b275ce188c)\n\nThe fake profile identified by Proofpoint is likely to have\nbeen active for at least 2 years, established in late May 2018.\nAt least 1 victim of the “Marcy” honey trap had been in direct\ncommunication with the fake profile since November 2020;\nhowever, they officially became Facebook “friends” in 2019,\nwhich reveals the methodical and long-term strategic approach\nTA456 operators adopted to engage with high-value targets.\n\n_[Figure 5: The fake profile used to target US defense contractors (Source: Proofpoint)](https://www.proofpoint.com/au/blog/threat-insight/i-knew-you-were-trouble-ta456-targets-defense-contractor-alluring-social-media)_\n\nMarcy eventually also used a fake Gmail account associated\nwith the front to deliver malware, known as LEMPO (LIDERC).\nAccording to the research, private and corporate accounts were\naffected by TA456’s operation.\n\n\n-----\n\n_[Figure 6: Example of email used to deliver malware to the victim (Source: Proofpoint)](https://www.proofpoint.com/au/blog/threat-insight/i-knew-you-were-trouble-ta456-targets-defense-contractor-alluring-social-media)_\n\n##### Charming Kitten\n\nCharming Kitten is one of the most widely reported Iranian\nthreat activity groups with a strong focus on social engineering\nto target its victims. Above we covered its overlapping campaign\ntracked as TA453, while below we highlight the activities tied to\nthe group from other vendors.\n\n\nThroughout 2021, social engineering attacks emanating\nfrom Charming Kitten operations employed much of their known\n[tradecraft. This included the use of phishing to enable credential](https://blog.certfa.com/posts/charming-kitten-christmas-gift/)\ntheft operations and invitations to conduct interviews, as noted\nearlier (for example, IMO chat). A recurrent aspect of their\ncredential theft activity was the use of SMS for smishing attacks,\nusing traditional Google security or Google recovery messages.\nThis activity likely took place in parallel with the establishment\nof attacker-controlled infrastructure.\n\nIn 2020, ClearSky Security released its third edition of\n[“The Kittens Are Back in Town”, a report detailing persistent](https://www.clearskysec.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Kittens-are-Back-in-Town-3.pdf)\nattempts by Charming Kitten operators to engage directly with\nvictims. The objective of the engagement was to drive victims to\nencrypted chat platforms, such as WhatsApp, and onward to join\nfake video conferences where, presumably, the victims would fall\nfurther down the chain of compromise. All of the detected cases\nbegan with spearphishing emails; the attackers developed fake\npersonas that spoofed real journalists and fake email accounts\n[to enable the ruse. The group has spoofed major news entities,](https://blog.certfa.com/posts/fake-interview-the-new-activity-of-charming-kitten/)\nincluding the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, CNN, and\nDeutsche Welle.\n\n\n_Fi_ _7 E_ _l_ _f_ _i hi_ _tt_ _k (L ft)_ _d G_ _l_ _S_ _it_ _(Ri ht) b_ _Ch_ _i_ _Kitt_ _(S_ _C_ _tf_ _L b)_\n\n\n-----\n\n_[Figure 8: The attackers brazenly attempt a call as part of their first interaction with the victim (Source: ClearSky)](https://www.clearskysec.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Kittens-are-Back-in-Town-3.pdf)_\n\n\nFigures 9 and 10 depict a conversation between the attackers\nand a victim, revealing persistent attempts to engage, even when\nvictims did not respond to the attackers’ lure.\n\nBeyond persistence and a sense of authority (“I am Yalda …\nfrom Deutsche Welle”) the attackers employed other techniques\nto strengthen their relationship with victims. This included\nflattery (“we invited you as a special speaker”), and a form of\nreciprocity (the sign-up walkthrough) which potentially made\nthe target feel indebted to the attacker for “assistance” offered.\nAs noted in the Mitigation section, multiple social engineering\ntechniques depend on human psychology to aid the attacker\nthrough their plot.\n\n\n##### APT35\n\nIn February 2019, the US Department of Justice (DoJ)\n[unsealed an indictment against a former US Air Force Intelligence](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/16/us/monica-witt-iran.html)\nOfficer, Monica Elfriede Witt, and APT35. Witt, after defecting\nto Iran, cooperated with its intelligence and cyber operatives\nto supply classified and compromising information against US\nintelligence agents. Four years before the indictment, members of\nAPT35 established a fake Facebook profile under the name “Bella\nWood” to enable the operation. The operators used the Facebook\naccount to send a friend request to a US intelligence officer\ndeployed to Afghanistan for a US Central Command (CENTCOM)\njoint intelligence unit. APT35 operators also used an email, bella.\nwood87@yahoo[.]com, to contact the same intelligence officer.\nThe following is an account of their engagements:\n\n\n-----\n\n_[Figure 9: The correspondence shows the attacker’s persistence toward the victim (Source: ClearSky)](https://www.clearskysec.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Kittens-are-Back-in-Town-3.pdf)_\n\n_Hello my dear ... invitation card sent to you_\n_by email I got this pretty card accept me as a_\n_kind friend._\n\n_I’ll send you a file including my photos but u_\n_should deactivate your anti virus to open it_\n_because i designed my photos with a photo_\n_album software, I hope you enjoy the photos_\n_i designed for the new year, they should be_\n_opened in your computer honey._\n\nAPT35 continued to execute social engineering attacks\nas part of the same operation against US intelligence officers.\nPresumably due to the information they had collected as part of\ntheir cooperation with Witt, they created a fake Facebook profile\nthat impersonated another US intelligence officer. According to\nthe indictment, the attackers also used information and pictures\nfrom the officer’s real account to enable their operation. The\nIran-nexus group continued their activities, using the fake profile\nto engage with another 2 US intelligence officers, including\nattempts to disseminate malware via Facebook and penetrating\na closed Facebook group of other US intelligence officers. APT35\noperatives also led a watering-hole attack against US officers\nusing a fake news website and devised spoofed domains used\nto launch credential theft spearphishing attacks.\n\n\n##### APT34/COBALT GYPSY\n\n**_Hard Pass and Rebecca Watts_**\n\nThe Hard Pass campaign was [reported by FireEye in July](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/hard-pass-declining-apt34-invite-to-join-their-professional-network)\n2019 and captured Iran-nexus operatives highly likely associated\nwith APT34 that impersonated a member of Cambridge\nUniversity called “Rebecca Watts”. The operators behind Watts\ndeveloped and used a LinkedIn profile to engage professionals\nin the utilities, government, and oil and gas sectors.\n\nThe operators used the profile first to seek candidate\nresumes and then used the established trust to send back\nan Excel spreadsheet with an embedded exploit. Notably, the\nlanguage used by the operators also claimed that Watts was\nrushed when sending the request to access the spreadsheet,\nwhich could excuse the allegedly native English speaker from\nmaking grammatical errors. Under normal circumstances, such\ngrammatical errors as shown in Figure 11 may raise suspicion from\na native English speaker. The group used the image of Cambridge\nUniversity with a top-level domain that mimicked the institution’s\ndomain-naming convention. With little to no knowledge of the\ninstitution’s real domain structure, an unsuspecting victim would\nnot have easily identified the ruse.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 10: The “Hard Pass” campaign revolved around the use of a fake recruiter profile (Source:_\n_[FireEye)](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/hard-pass-declining-apt34-invite-to-join-their-professional-network)_\n\nThe use of LinkedIn mimics APT34’s use of social media to\ndeliver malicious documents to unsuspecting victims and is likely\npart of the group’s attempts to evade security technologies to\nblock malicious email traffic.\n\n**_“Mia Ash”_**\n\nIn July 2017, SecureWorks [reported one of the first known](https://www.secureworks.com/research/the-curious-case-of-mia-ash)\npublic cases of a long-term social engineering operation\nassociated with APT34/Cobalt Gypsy. The case focused on\nthe use of a traditional honey trap sock puppet to deceive an\nemployee of a targeted company. Mia Ash reportedly contacted\nthe target via LinkedIn, claiming she was “part of an exercise\nto reach out to people around the world”. The operators behind\nAsh used the receptiveness of the victim to establish a virtual\nrelationship, exchanging professional and personal information,\na technique also used at great lengths in the Marcy Flores\ncampaign outlined previously. The relationship spread to social\nmedia through a “friendship” on Facebook but also continued via\nemail and via WhatsApp. Two months after the initial exchange,\na PupyRAT-laden Excel document was sent to the personal email\nof the victim.\n\n\n_[Figure 11: A captured screenshot of the fake LinkedIn profile of Mia Ash (Source: Secureworks)](https://www.secureworks.com/research/the-curious-case-of-mia-ash)_\n\nAccording to Secureworks, “Victim A”, a target of the Mia\nAsh campaign with approximately 10 years of experience in the\noil and gas, aviation, and telecommunications sectors, possibly\nshared his personal information to register domains for the\nattackers. Secureworks provided the following hypotheses to\nexplain the act:\n\n  - Victim A registered a domain for Mia Ash, and the threat\n\nactor reciprocated by registering a domain for Victim A\nto keep Victim A as an active, unknown participant in the\nthreat actor’s operations.\n\n  - The threat actor compromised Victim A’s accounts.\n\n  - Victim A registered both domains as a romantic or\n\nfriendly gesture.\n\n  - Domains were registered using fraudulent information.\n\n  - Victim A works for the threat actor.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Social Engineering and Dissidents\n\n**_Targeting Dissidents and the Diaspora_**\n\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran uses social engineering to target\nentities and individuals they perceive to be threats or enemies of\nthe state. In some instances, their operations have proven to be\nsuccessful, brazen, and apparently meticulously planned. Some\nreported cases involve targeting dissidents living in the United\nStates, with plans of extracting them to Iran to face prosecution\nby the Islamic Republic, as noted most recently in a July 2021\n[unsealed indictment by the US Department of Justice. The case](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/iranian-intelligence-officials-indicted-kidnapping-conspiracy-charges)\ndetails revealed Iranian intelligence services established a ruse\nthat concealed their motives and hired a private intelligence\ngroup in North America to conduct surveillance against a\njournalist, human rights activist, and author living in Brooklyn,\nNew York. The case revealed that MOIS agents, or individuals\nassociated with the organization, claimed to represent a private\nparty in Dubai and that the targets of the intelligence operations\nhad stolen or owed money to the client in the UAE. As part of\nthe plot, MOIS agents provided contact information, including\na telephone number with a UAE country code, to convince the\nprivate investigator that the request was coming from the UAE.\nThe following is an excerpt from the indictment, which cites the\nstatement from the attackers:\n\n_I am contacting you on behalf of a client_\n_looking [for] a missing person from Dubai,_\n_UAE who has fled to avoid debt repayment._\n_We require your services to conduct a_\n_surveillance on potential address of missing_\n_person… Will need high quality pictures/video_\n_of persons living in the address and cars they_\n_drive._\n\nOther major cases involve using the profile of [journalists](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-hackers-exclusive-idUSKBN1ZZ1MS)\nto target diaspora Iranians involved in various sectors, or to\ntarget dissident activists, such as Ruhollah Zam. Zam, the former\nleader of the dissident news group AmadNews, was tricked into\nleaving France, where he had asylum, in October 2019 to travel\n[to Iraq. Reportedly, the IRGC’s Intelligence Organization (IRGC-](https://www.timesofisrael.com/how-iran-lured-a-dissident-from-france-to-his-execution/)\nIO) took responsibility for the operation. Open source reporting\n[suggests he was duped into believing he was to interview Iraq’s](https://www.timesofisrael.com/how-iran-lured-a-dissident-from-france-to-his-execution/)\nmost senior Shia leader, Ayatollah Ali Sistani. Supposedly, the\ninterview was a prelude to the establishment of a new television\nchannel sponsored by an “individual claiming to be an Iranian\nbusinessman”. Upon his arrival, he was captured by pro-regime\nelements that transferred him to Iranian custody. Zam was\n[executed by the Islamic Republic in December 2020.](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-55285301)\n\n\nThe lesser-known case of Asal Kaviani ( عسل کاویانی,)\nreported by a Persian-language anti-government source, also\nreveals the Iranian system’s ability to set up ruses against its\ntargets. According to the dissident report, Kaviani contacted\nthe anti-government source, revealing she was the sister of\nan IRGC cyber engineer. In exchange for a government-issued\nlaptop presumably full of information regarding the IRGC’s cyber\nprograms, Kaviani wanted the source to help her brother escape\nfrom the organization.\n\n_Figure 13: Iranian dissident report highlights social engineering attack by Iranian government. For a_\n_full translation, see Appendix (Source: Iranian dissident reporting)_\n\nThe dissident organization claimed that while highly\nsuspicious of Kaviani, they entertained the approach for 3\nmonths to gather more information. Kaviani proposed a physical\nexchange with the dissident organization to provide the laptop\nas proof; the encounter was supposed to take place at a wellknown metro stop in Tehran. The dissident organization claimed\nthat the exchange was aborted due to an increased chance that\nthe meeting was in fact a counterintelligence sting operation. No\nadditional information was supplied to verify the attempt, except\nfor screenshots of emails allegedly written by Kaviani (Figure 14).\n\nIf in fact a targeted operation, the incident reveals the group\nwas acutely aware of the dissident source’s efforts to report\non the activities of the IRGC, its personnel, and its cyber wing,\nthe IRGC-Electronic Warfare and Cyber Defense Organization\n(IRGC-EWCD).\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Social Engineering and Influence Operations\n\nSocial engineering operations, albeit not traditional ones,\nhave also started to become increasingly intertwined with\ninfluence operations in what Iranian strategists would term the\noffensive Soft War. The identified incidents suggest Iranian threat\nactors operating for entities linked to APTs are adopting fake\npersonas and attempting to use them to influence behaviors.\nIn at least one related case, the dissemination of malware also\npotentially occurred when a sock puppet account was linked to\nAndroid and Windows-based malware.\n\n##### Proud Boys\n\nOn November 18, 2021, the US Department of Justice, in\ncoordination with the US Department of the Treasury, unsealed\nan indictment and designated for sanctions Iranian companies\nand nationals associated with cyber intrusions and US elections\ninterference, respectively. The Department of Justice specifically\nindicted Seyyed Mohammad Hosein Musa Kazemi and Sajjad\nKashian, both members of Iranian entity Eeleyanet Gostar,\nnow known as Emennet Pasargad, for a “targeted, coordinated\ncampaign to erode confidence in the integrity of the US electoral\nsystem and to sow discord among Americans”. The operation\nwas devised by those indicted and impersonated the far-right\nAmerican extremist group the Proud Boys.\n\n_[Figure 14: Proud Boys email sent to Democratic voters (Source: Pensacola News)](https://www.pnj.com/story/news/2020/10/21/escambia-pensacola-voters-threatening-emails-proud-boys-vote-trump-election/3717125001/)_\n\n\n##### Anti-Dissident Operations\n\n[In December 2020, Treadstone71 issued a report on a large-](https://www.treadstone71.com/index.php/intel-briefs/irgcinfluenceops)\nscale coordinated social media operation run by the IRGC, the\nBasij, and MOIS to penetrate and influence Farsi-language\naudiences that converged around a real-life conference. The\noperation targeted entities affiliated with the NCRI and MEK\nand involved members of these agencies masquerading as\nregime opponents. Their objective was to blend in as members\nof opposition movements or general diaspora Iranians and\nmanipulate and misinform online discussions. From there, they\nused their position apparently to support general, high-level\nanti-government statements but in actuality to target antigovernment movements and personalities such as the MEK\nand NCRI. This aspect of their tradecraft was likely devised\nto prevent increased skepticism and suspicion of the target\naudiences versus the cyber operator’s sock puppet.\n\n##### Endless Mayfly\n\nAnother efficacious example of Iran’s social engineering\ncapabilities relating to information operations is represented\nin the Endless Mayfly campaign. The campaign was [disclosed](https://citizenlab.ca/2019/05/burned-after-reading-endless-mayflys-ephemeral-disinformation-campaign/)\nby CitizenLab in May 2019 and represents one of the more\naggressive publicly known campaigns run by Iranian operatives.\nIn this campaign, the use of fake personas, fake news sites, and\npotentially malware converged for disinformation and intrusion\nactivities. Among the many fake profiles, one was identified\nof “Mona A. Rahman”, a self-proclaimed political analyst and\nwriter. The profile held anti-Saudi Arabian government views and\ncovered the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. The profile engaged\nwith real-life activists to incite physical protests. In the latter\nstages of the Endless Mayfly campaign, the Mona Rahman profile\nalso directly engaged with activists and critics.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe majority of the Endless Mayfly campaign focused on\ninfluence activity and disinformation efforts, but a smaller\ncomponent also revealed how a domain was linked to malware\nsamples. The website associated with the domain, according to\nCitizenLab, “hosted inauthentic profiles and tweets for prominent\nfigures… [including] spoofed tweets by Turkish Prime Minister\nRecep Tayyip Erdoğan and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin\nSalman”. At the time of writing, CitizenLab researchers could\nnot confirm whether the identified malware was used to target\nvictims via the Endless Mayfly network.\n\n##### Mitigations Against Social Engineering\n\n Strategic\n\n  - Establish robust policies and carry out social engineering\n\nand anti-phishing awareness exercises to help detect\nand prevent attacks.\n\n  - Create testing environments to ensure the workforce is\n\ncertified to counter social engineering attacks.\n\n  - Provide social media best practices awareness training to\n\nhelp mitigate the possibility that employees inadvertently\nrelease confidential information.\n\n  - Ensure that effective two-factor authentication (2FA)\n\nmechanisms are in place to help stop social engineering\nattacks.\n\n\n##### Operational/Tactical\n\n  - Iranian operators have repeatedly used fake charismatic\n\nprofiles or those that impersonate recruitment offers\nto engage with victims. Treat all unrecognized social or\nprofessional correspondence as suspicious.\n\n  - Attackers aim to drive victims to platforms where they\n\nare empowered, via a malicious program or otherwise.\nAvoid unsolicited requests to establish communication\nthrough additional methods, especially unapproved chat\nor messaging applications.\n\n  - “Cold-calling”, either via email or social media, is a\n\nprime method Iranian social engineering operators use\nto engage with victims. Be on the lookout for signs of\ninauthentic or reused material, as the social engineer will\nattempt to emulate these common practices.\n\n  - Some reported cases of social engineering and\n\nphishing aim to create a sense of fear or emergency\n(for example,“Google Security Team” messages). If you\nreceive any message that appears urgent, pause and\nevaluate the situation before reacting.\n\n  - The use of SMS phishing has been associated with\n\nIranian social engineering attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Outlook\n\nSince the first reports emerged in 2014, Iranian social\nengineering campaigns have persisted and continued to innovate.\nWhile many of the early operations, such as Newscaster, were\nlittered with rudimentary grammatical mistakes and weak\noperational security, these defects have disappeared. Those\nperpetrating the social engineering attacks are now executing\noperations impersonating high-ranking think tank directors,\njournalists, business officials, scientists, anti-government threat\nactors, and even government officials. This characteristic of\ntheir operations has not diverged extensively and is expected\nto continue, as they mimic their targets or attempt to establish\nrelationships with them based on professional interests.\n\nWith time, the operators are likely to continue to improve their\napproach and ability to target their victims. It is highly likely that\nthese approaches will focus on tried and tested methods, such\nas using a journalistic persona, soliciting interviews and analytic\nopinions, and sharing reports with targets to enable credential\ntheft operations. Social engineering will also likely continue to\nevolve as long-term operations as depicted by the TA456 “I Knew\nYou Were Trouble” campaign. With the growing role of social\nmedia among younger generations, fake and imposter accounts\nmay even take on a more significant role and may even employ\n[deep fake technologies.](https://graphika.com/reports/operationffs-fake-face-swarm/)\n\nAlthough the adoption of new technologies such as deep\nfakes is likely, threat actor operations may also be limited in\nscope by these technologies. For example, it is unclear whether\nAPT groups will adopt “deep fakes” to facilitate intrusions or\nonly for influence operations, similar to the Proud Boys election\ninterference activity.\n\n\nIranian operators are also expected to become more\ncompetent in using foreign languages in social engineering\nattacks. As depicted in the large-scale Proud Boy operation,\nthreat activity groups are ready to engage with large audiences,\neven during periods of increased scrutiny. Their capabilities have\nalso spread well beyond the English language, as depicted in\nvarious influence and cyberattack operations around the world\nthat incorporated Arabic, Spanish, French, Hebrew, and Turkish,\namong others. This suggests that a supply of foreign-language\ncapable or trained operatives is tasked with social engineering\noperations.\n\nOpen source reporting indicates that APT35 is more likely\nto attempt to drive victims to engage with them in one-on-one\ndialogues in the future. While Insikt Group cannot verify such\nassessments, industry reporting has supplied ample evidence of\nthe group’s desire to engage with victims. Additionally, the use\nof malicious software is also highly likely to continue to enable\nthis activity in the future, as the group and others like it attempt\nto hook their targets.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Appendix\n\n_[Source: Certfa Lab](https://blog.certfa.com/posts/fake-interview-the-new-activity-of-charming-kitten/)_\n\n\n-----\n\nKaviani Email:\n\n_Hello,_\n\n_I’m Asal, thank you for your good reporting.
