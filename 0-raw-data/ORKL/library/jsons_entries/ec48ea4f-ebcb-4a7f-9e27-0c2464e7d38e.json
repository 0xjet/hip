Since that time, many cybercriminals has adopted it and augmented with their](https://threatpost.com/zeus-source-code-leaked-051011/75217/)\nown ideas. Recently, among the payloads delivered by exploit kits, we often find Terdot.A/Zloader – a downloader installing on the victim\nmachine a ZeuS-based malware.\n\n[The payload is very similar to the malware described in this article and referenced under the name Sphinx. However, after consulting with other](https://securityintelligence.com/brazil-cant-catch-a-break-after-panda-comes-the-sphinx/)\n[researchers (special thanks to Matthew Mesa), we got proven that the bot that is sold as Sphinx is very different (sample). Since there are](https://twitter.com/mesa_matt)\nmany confusions about the naming, we decided to stick to the name Terdot Zloader/Zbot.\n\nIn this post we will have a look at the features and internals of this malware. As we will see, the dropped package consists not only of malicious\nfiles – but also legitimate applications, used for the malicious purpose.\n\n## Analyzed sample\n\n[d45b8a20a991acd01d2ff63735fc1adf – original executable #1](https://virustotal.com/en/file/952418768f698fc731d52e06a9d25c45486ebc21f31586f025ebe98d6f998f66/analysis/)\n\n[950368afb934fd3fd5b2d4e6704b757b – original executable #2](https://virustotal.com/en/file/c4b894094c08ea234a2a2652f77383f4a22c5402918c330a7ad6f39520dcc53c/analysis/)\n\n[fca092aca679edd9564d00e9640f939d – original executable #3](https://virustotal.com/en/file/9ee649300ee66768afdb2b8866d504e802bd40fd8e4125667bb0f0e2bb6d339f/analysis/)\n\n[ae1d1f4597f76912d7bd9962b96eecbb – loader (unpacked)](https://virustotal.com/en/file/611d0954c55a7cb4471478763fe58aa791dc4bbf345d7b5a96808e6d1d264f96/analysis/)\n\n[268fd83403da27a80ab1a3cf9ac45b67 – payload.dll (injected into explorer)](https://virustotal.com/en/file/bd44645d62f634c5ca65b110b2516bdd22462f8b2f3957dbcd821fa5bdeb38a2/analysis/1483378919/)\n\n[6c34779503414210378371d250a3a1af – client32.dll (Zbot downloaded and injected into msiexec, and into browsers)](https://virustotal.com/en/file/f76e614723432398d1b7d2c4224728204b3bd9c5725e8200a925e8cbf349344c/analysis/1483379079/)\n\n[f9373dc232028da52ad33b017e33bbd3 – original executable #4](https://virustotal.com/en/file/7aa5318a4cf3534ee34f0c542620c03608a95040e8a44ac71150c8e48e6e7ddc/analysis/)\n\n## Distribution\n\n[Most of the analyzed samples were dropped from SundownEK – some of the campaigns are described in details here: 28 Dec 2016,](https://twitter.com/jeromesegura/status/813807695337664512) 6 Jan\n2017, and [18 Jan 2017. However, we also encountered cases when the Terdot.A/Zloader was dropped by the malicious email attachment.](http://www.broadanalysis.com/2017/01/18/sundown-exploit-kit-from-88-99-41-189-and-93-190-143-185-delivers-terdot-a-zloader/)\n\n## Behavioral analysis\n\nAfter the sample is run, we can see it deploying explorer and then terminating. It is easy to guess, that it injected some malicious modules\nthere.\n\n\n-----\n\ne attac a debugge to t e e p o e p ocess, e ca see t e jected s e code, a o g t a e e (pay oad d ) e te est g\nand unusual thing, typical for this Zloader is, that the DLL does not start at the beginning of the memory page, but after the shellcode:\n\nIf we have an internet connection, the Zloader will load the second stage (the main bot) and inject it into msiexec.exe.\n\nThe injected module beacons to the CnC and downloads other modules. Observed patterns of the gates:\n```\n/FE8hVs3/gs98h.php\n/bdk/gate.php\n\n```\nThe communication is encrypted:\n\n\n-----\n\nC C espo ds t a e e t e odu e o t e a a e (c e t3 _d )_ o oade dec ypts t t e e o y a d jects u t e a te a\nwhile we can see the explorer terminating and another program being deployed: msiexec. The initial malware executable is deleted.\n\nAttaching debugger to msiexec, we can find the Zbot (client32.dll) implanted and running in the process space.\n\nFrom inside of the injected module another internet connection is made, and some new elements are being downloaded and dropped\n(including legitimate applications like certutil and php – their role will be described further). The same client32.dll is also injected in browsers.\n\nThe module deployed inside msiexec.exe is used as a supervisor. It opens TCP sockets locally and communicates with the modules injected in\nbrowsers, in order to monitor opened pages.\n\n\n-----\n\n**MitM**\n\nThe main module of the bot downloads and drops some new elements into the %TEMP% folder. Surprisingly, those files are non-malware. We\n[can see the certutil application (0c6b43c9602f4d5ac9dcf907103447c4) along with it’s dependencies – legitimate DLLs.](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc732443(v=ws.11).aspx)\n\nIn the same folder, there is also some alien certificate (filename, as well as the name of the issuer is randomly generated).\n\n\n-----\n\nThe certificate is installed with the help of the certutil, for the purpose of Man-in-the-Middle attacks (in such cases they are also called Man-inthe-Browser).\n\nExample – a command line deployed during tests:\n```\n\"C:\\Users\\tester\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\certutil.exe\" \n-A -n \"otdarufyr\" \n-t \"C,C,C\" -i \"C:\\Users\\tester\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\nedea.crt\" \n-d \"C:\\Users\\tester\\AppData\\Roaming\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Profiles\\be7dt337.default\"\n\n```\nIt is easy to guess that this malware targets web browsers. Indeed, if we run a browser and try to visit some site over HTTPS, we will see that\nthe original certificates are replaced by the malicious one. See examples below – draw attention that the subject of the certificate contains the\nvalid domain – only the issuer field can let us recognize, that the certificate is not legitimate:\n\nSatander MitB on Firefox:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe browser claims that the connection is secure – but when we see the details, we can find, that the connection is “protected” by the fake\ncertificate dropped by the malware:\n\nFacebook MitB on InternetExplorer:\n\n\n-----\n\nBrowsers do not alert about any inconsistency – and the user who was not vigilant enough to check the details of the certificate, may easily get\ndeceived…\n\nIf we attach a debbugger into the running browser, we can see that the same client32.dll is injected there – along with some more code used\nfor API redirections.\n\n**Persistence**\n\nIn addition to the content dropped in %TEMP%, we can see some new folders with random names created in %APPDATA%:\n\n\n-----\n\nInteresting fact is that one of them contains legitimate php.exe (see on VirusTotal: [php.exe,](https://virustotal.com/en/file/0ea0dbcbf78a85b47ec9c98c1fd7c8ff9a71a9986cd6fcf953a1b2f15609d349/analysis/) [php5ts.dll).](https://virustotal.com/en/file/018e13cab4c50261776dc7f641f1c3dd1000cafa21759bac221765663efce806/analysis/)\n\n…and some obfuscated php code:\n\nThis file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

It is\nresponsible for connecting with the CnC and downloading the main malicious module, that is the Zbot.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Zbot – client32.dll**\n\nThe second stage is also a DLL – this time it is injected into msiexec.exe as well as into browsers:\n\n**Attacked targets**\n\nThe bot injects itself into the most popular browsers, in order to hook their API:\n\n\n-----\n\nIt excludes from the attack computers with Russian language installed – but instead of doing it silently, like most of the malware – it is very\nopenly announcing this fact:\n\nThe SQL part\n\n[Inside the bot we can find references to an SQL release from the end of 2016 (see SQLite Release 3.15.1 On 2016-11-04):](https://www.sqlite.org/releaselog/3_15_1.html)\n```\n2016-11-04 12:08:49 1136863c76576110e710dd5d69ab6bf347c65e36\n\n```\nPresence of those references confirms, that the bot is pretty new, and probably under active development.\n\nWe can also see many SQL queries and related error messages among the strings:\n\n\n-----\n\nThey are used to read and manipulate browser cookies, that are stored in form of SQLite databases.\n\nQueries deployed:\n\n\n-----\n\nMan-in-the-Browser\n\nThe main module injected into msiexec opens local TCP sockets that are used to communicate with the module injected into browser.\n\nAll the communication between the browser and particular website is first bypassed by client32.dll injected into msiexec.\n\nLike many Zbots, Terdot not only spy but also allows to modify the displayed content, by “WebInjects” and “WebFakes”.\n\n\n-----\n\nS tes t at a e go g to be oo ed a e spec ed by co gu at o a p e o t e ta get st o o e o t e sa p es s o s, t at t e a\n[interest of the attackers are various banks: https://gist.github.com/hasherezade/4db462af582c079b0ffa059b1fd2c465#file-targets-txt](https://gist.github.com/hasherezade/4db462af582c079b0ffa059b1fd2c465#file-targets-txt)\n\nWebinjects are implemented by adding malicious scripts (specialized for a specific target) into the content of the website.

Feature-wise it is similar to other bankers. However, I think it deserved some attention because of it’s\nrecent popularity. It has been prepared with attention to details, so we may suspect that it is a work of professionals. It is actively developed,\ndistributed and maintained – so, the probability is high, that we will be seeing it more in the future.\n\n_This was a guest post written by Hasherezade, an independent researcher and programmer with a strong interest in InfoSec.
