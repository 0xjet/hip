    "plain_text": "# FIREBALL – The Chinese Malware of 250 Million Computers Infected\n\n**[blog.checkpoint.com/2017/06/01/fireball-chinese-malware-250-million-infection/](http://blog.checkpoint.com/2017/06/01/fireball-chinese-malware-250-million-infection/)**\n\nJune 1, 2017\n\nCheck Point Threat Intelligence and research teams recently discovered a high volume\nChinese threat operation which has infected over 250 million computers worldwide. The\ninstalled malware, Fireball, takes over target browsers and turns them into zombies.\nFireball has two main functionalities: the ability of running any code on victim computers–\ndownloading any file or malware, and hijacking and manipulating infected users’ web-traffic\nto generate ad-revenue. Currently, Fireball installs plug-ins and additional configurations to\nboost its advertisements, but just as easily it can turn into a prominent distributor for any\nadditional malware.\n\nThis operation is run by Rafotech, a large digital marketing agency based in Beijing.\nRafotech uses Fireball to manipulate the victims’ browsers and turn their default search\nengines and home-pages into fake search engines. This redirects the queries to either\nyahoo.com or Google.com. The fake search engines include tracking pixels used to collect\nthe users’ private information. Fireball has the ability to spy on victims, perform efficient\nmalware dropping, and execute any malicious code in the infected machines, this creates a\nmassive security flaw in targeted machines and networks.\n\nKEY FINDINGS\n\nCheck Point analysts uncovered a high volume Chinese threat operation which has\ninfected over 250 million computers worldwide, and 20% of corporate networks.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware, called Fireball, acts as a browser-hijacker but and can be turned into a\nfull-functioning malware downloader. Fireball is capable of executing any code on the\nvictim machines, resulting in a wide range of actions from stealing credentials to\ndropping additional malware.\nFireball is spread mostly via bundling i.e. installed on victim machines alongside a\nwanted program, often without the user’s consent.\nThe operation is run by Chinese digital marketing agency.\nTop infected countries are India (10.1%) and Brazil (9.6%)\n\n_Figure 1: Fireball Infection Flow_\n\n250 MILLIONS MACHINES AND 20% OF CORPORATE NETWORKS WORLDWIDE\nINFECTED\n\nThe scope of the malware distribution is alarming. According to our analysis, over 250\nmillion computers worldwide have been infected: specifically, 25.3 million infections in\nIndia (10.1%), 24.1 million in Brazil (9.6%), 16.1 million in Mexico (6.4%), and 13.1 million in\nIndonesia (5.2%). The United States has witnessed 5.5 million infections (2.2%).\n\nBased on Check Point’s global sensors, 20% of all corporate networks are affected . Hit\nrates in the US (10.7%) and China (4.7%) are alarming;but Indonesia (60%), India (43%)\nand Brazil (38%) have much more dangerous hit rates.\n\n\n-----\n\nAnother indicator of the incredibly high infection rate is the popularity of Rafotech s fake\nsearch engines. According to Alexa’s web traffic data, 14 of these fake search engines are\namong the top 10,000 websites, with some of them occasionally reaching the top 1,000.\n\n_Figure 2: Fireball Global Infection Rates (darker pink = more infections)_\n\nIronically, although Rafotech doesn’t admit it produces browser-hijackers and fake search\nengines, it does (proudly) declare itself a successful marketing agency, reaching 300 million\nusers worldwide – coincidentally similar to our number of estimated infections.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3: Rafotech’s Advertisement on the Company’s Official Website_\n\nA BACKDOOR TO EVERY INFECTED NETWORK\n\nFireball and similar browser-hijackers are hybrid creatures, half seemingly legitimate\nsoftware (see the GOING UNDER THE RADAR section), and half malware. Although\nRafotech uses Fireball only for advertising and initiating traffic to its fake search engines, it\ncan perform any action on the victims’ machines These actions can have serious\nconsequences. How severe is it? Try to imagine a pesticide armed with a nuclear bomb.\nYes, it can do the job, but it can also do much more.\n\nThese browser-hijackers are capable on the browser level. This means that they can drive\nvictims to malicious sites, spy on them and conduct successful malware dropping.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, Fireball displays great sophistication and quality evasion\ntechniques, including anti-detection capabilities, multi-layer structure and a flexible C&C– it\nis not inferior to a typical malware.\n\nMany threat actors would like to have a fraction of Rafotech’s power, as Fireball provides a\ncritical backdoor, which can be further exploited.\n\nGOING UNDER THE RADAR\n\nWhile the distribution of Fireball is both malicious and illegitimate, it actually carries digital\ncertificates imparting them a legitimate appearance. Confused? You should be.\n\n\n-----\n\nRafotech carefully walks along the edge of legitimacy, knowing that adware distribution is\nnot considered a crime like malware distribution is. How is that? Many companies provide\nsoftware or services for free, and make their profits by harvesting data or presenting\nadvertisements. Once a client agrees to the installment of extra features or software to\nhis/her computer, it is hard to claim malicious intent on behalf of the provider.\n\nThis gray zone led to the birth of a new kind of monetizing method – bundling. Bundling is\nwhen a wanted program installs another program alongside it, sometimes with a user’s\nauthorization and sometimes without. Rafotech uses bundling in high volume to spread\nFireball.\n\n_Figure 4: Bundling in Action_\n\nAccording to our analysis, Rafotech’s distribution methods appear to be illegitimate and\ndon’t follow the criteria which would allow these actions to be considered naïve or legal. The\nmalware and the fake search engines don’t carry indicators connecting them to Rafotech,\nthey cannot be uninstalled by an ordinary user, and they conceal their true nature.\n\nSo how do they carry digital certificates? One possibility is that issuers make their living\nfrom providing certificates, and small issuers with flexible ethics can enjoy the lack of clarity\nin the adware world’s legality to approve software such as Rafotech’s browser-hijackers.\n\nTHE INFECTION MODEL\n\n\n-----\n\nAs with other types of malware, there are many ways for Fireball to spread. We suspect that\ntwo popular vectors are bundling the malware to other Rafotech products – Deal Wifi and\nMustang Browser – as well as bundling via other freeware distributors: products such as\n“Soso Desktop”, “FVP Imageviewer” and others.\n\nIt’s important to remember that when a user installs freeware, additional malware isn’t\nnecessarily dropped at the same time. If you download a suspicious freeware and nothing\nhappens on the spot, it doesn’t necessarily mean that something isn’t happening behind the\nscenes.\n\nFurthermore, it is likely that Rafotech is using additional distribution methods, such as\nspreading freeware under fake names, spam, or even buying installs from threat actors.\n\nAs with everything in the internet, remember that there are no free lunches. When you\ndownload freeware, or use cost-free services (streaming and downloads, for example), the\nservice provider is making profit somehow. If it’s not from you or from advertisements, it will\ncome from somewhere else.\n\n_Figure 5: Deal Wifi Installation Screen_\n\nHOW CAN I KNOW IF I AM INFECTED?\n\n\n-----\n\nTo check if you re infected, first open your web browser. Was your home-page set by you?\nAre you able to modify it? Are you familiar with your default search engine and can modify\nthat as well? Do you remember installing all of your browser extensions?\n\nIf the answer to any of these questions is “NO”, this is a sign that you’re infected with\nadware. You can also use a recommended adware scanner, just to be extra cautious.\n\n_Figure 6: trotux.com; a Fake Search Engine Run by Rafotech_\n\nTHE RED BUTTON IN THE WRONG HANDS\n\nIt doesn’t take much to imagine a scenario in which Rafotech decides to harvest sensitive\ninformation from all of its infected machines, and sell this data to threat groups or business\nrivals. Banking and credit card credentials, medical files, patents and business plans can all\nbe widely exposed and abused by threat actors for various purposes. Based on our\nestimated infection rate, in such a scenario, one out of five corporations worldwide will be\nsusceptible to a major breach. Severe damage can be caused to key organizations, from\nmajor service providers to critical infrastructure operators to medical institutions. The\npotential loss is indescribable, and repairing the damage caused by such massive data\nleakage (if even possible) could take years.\n\nRafotech holds the power to initiate a global catastrophe and it is not alone. During our\nresearch we’ve tracked down additional browser-hijackers that, to our understanding, were\ndeveloped by other companies. One such company is ELEX Technology, an Internet\nServices company also based in Beijing produces products similar to those of Rafotech.\n\n\n-----\n\nSeveral findings lead us to suspect that the two companies are related, and may be\ncollaborating in the distribution of browser-hijackers or in trading customers’ traffic. For\nexample, an adware developed by ELEX, named YAC (“Yet Another Cleaner”) is suspected\nto be connected to Rafotech’s operation, dropping its browser-hijackers.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn this research we’ve described Rafotech’s browser-hijackers operation – possibly the\nlargest infection operation in history. We believe that although this is not a typical malware\nattack campaign, it has the potential to cause irreversible damage to its victims as well as\nworldwide internet users, and therefore it must be blocked by security companies.\n\nThe full distribution of Fireball is not yet known, but it is clear that it presents a great threat\nto the global cyber ecosystem. With a quarter billion infected machines and a grip in one of\nevery five corporate networks, Rafotech’s activities make it an immense threat.\n\nHOW DO I REMOVE THE MALWARE, ONCE INFECTED?\n\nTo remove almost any adware, follow these simple steps:\n\n1.
