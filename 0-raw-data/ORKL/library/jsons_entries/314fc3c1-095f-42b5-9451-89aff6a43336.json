Unit 42 created the moniker\n“PKPLUG” for the threat actor group, or groups, behind these and other documented attacks\nreferenced later in this report. We say group or groups as our current visibility doesn’t allow us to\ndetermine with high confidence if this is the work of one group, or more than one group which\nuses the same tools and has the same tasking. The name comes from the tactic of delivering\nPlugX malware inside ZIP archive files as part of a DLL side-loading package. The ZIP file format\ncontains the ASCII magic-bytes “PK” in its header, hence PKPLUG.\n\nWhile tracking these attackers, Unit 42 discovered additional, mostly custom malware families\n[being used by PKPLUG beyond that of just PlugX. The additional payloads include HenBox, an](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-henbox-chickens-come-home-roost/)\n[Android app, and Farseer, a Windows backdoor. The attackers also use the 9002 Trojan, which is](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/farseer-previously-unknown-malware-family-bolsters-the-chinese-armoury/)\nbelieved to be shared among a small subset of attack groups. Other publicly available malware\nseen in relation to PKPLUG activity includes Poison Ivy and Zupdax.\n\nDuring our investigations and research into these attacks, we were able to relate previous attacks\ndocumented by others that date back as far back as six years ago. Unit 42 incorporates these\nfindings, together with our own, under the moniker PKPLUG and continue to track accordingly.\n\nIt’s not entirely clear as to the ultimate objectives of PKPLUG, but installing backdoor Trojan\nimplants on victim systems, including mobile devices, infers tracking victims and gathering\ninformation is a key goal.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe believe victims lay mainly in and around the Southeast Asia region, particularly Myanmar,\nTaiwan, Vietnam, and Indonesia; and likely also in various other areas in Asia, such as Tibet,\nXinjiang, and Mongolia. Based on targeting, content in some of the malware and ties to\ninfrastructure previously documented publicly as being linked to Chinese nation-state adversaries,\nUnit 42 believes with high confidence that PKPLUG has similar origins.\n\n# Targeting\n\nBased on our visibility into PKPLUG’s campaigns and what we’ve learned from collaborating with\nindustry partners, we believe victims lay mainly in and around the Southeast Asia region.\nSpecifically, the target countries/provinces include (with higher confidence), Myanmar and Taiwan\nas well as (with lower confidence), Vietnam and Indonesia. Other areas in Asia targeted include\n[Mongolia, Tibet and Xinjiang. This blog, and the associated Adversary Playbook, provides further](https://pan-unit42.github.io/playbook_viewer/?pb=pkplug)\ndetails including: the methods used for malware delivery, the social engineering topics of decoy\napplications and documents and the Command & Control (C2) infrastructure themes.\n\n[Indonesia, Myanmar and Vietnam are ASEAN members, contributing towards intergovernmental](https://asean.org/asean/asean-member-states/)\ncooperation in the region. Mongolia, specifically the independent country also known as Outer\nMongolia, has a long-standing and complex relationship with the PRC. Tibet and Xinjiang are\n[autonomous regions (AR) of China that tend to be classified by China’s ethnic minorities, granted](https://www.sporcle.com/blog/2019/04/what-are-the-autonomous-regions-of-china/)\nthe ability to govern themselves but ultimately answering to the People’s Republic of China\n(PRC). Tibet and Xinjiang are the only ARs, from five, where the ethnic group maintains a majority\nover other populations.\n\nMost, if not all, of the seven countries or regions, are involved in some way with Beijing’s Belt and\nRoad Initiative (BRI) designed to connect 71 countries across Southeast Asia to Eastern Europe\n[and Africa. The path through Xinjiang is especially important to the BRI’s success, but is more](https://thegeopolitics.com/china-and-xinjiang-the-fate-of-bri/)\n[often heard of due to conflicts between the Chinese government and the ethnic Uyghur](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/chinas-crackdown-uighurs-xinjiang)\npopulation. News of the BRI is peppered with stories of success and failure, of countries for and\nagainst the BRI and of countries pulling out of existing BRI projects.\n\n[Further tensions in the region are attributed to ownership claims over the South China Sea,](https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2018/08/asia/south-china-sea/)\nincluding fishing quotas and the yet unproven oil and gas reserves. At least three of the target\ncountries mentioned (Malaysia, Taiwan and Vietnam) have laid claim to parts of these waters, and\nsome use the area for the vast majority of their trade. Foriegn militaries also patrol, attempting to\nkeep the area open.\n\nTaiwan, which isn’t an AR and doesn’t appear to be actively involved with the BRI, has its own\n[long-standing history with the PRC — a recent $2.2 billion arms sale with the U.S. may](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2019/07/10/china-demands-us-cancel-arms-sale-taiwan.html)\nexacerbate matters.\n\n# Timeline\n\nBefore continuing, it’s worth highlighting our research and others relating to the intrusion set that\nwe refer to as PKPLUG. This section documents prior work surrounding cyber attacks relating to\nPKPLUG. The following figure illustrates the chronological order of the publications — highlighting\nsome key findings from each.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs you can see from the timeline, PKPLUG has been active for six years or more with a variety of\ntargets and methods of delivery and compromise.\n\n_Figure 1. Timeline of publications and key findings relating to PKPLUG_\n\nPlease note: the dates shown on the horizontal timeline bar in Figure 1 above relate to the\npublishing date, not the campaign dates, although some were fairly close together. As an\nexample to illustrate the difference in dates, HenBox was discovered in 2018 but has samples\nranging from 2015 through to this week. PlugX and Poison Ivy are still doing the rounds and their\n[use by different groups is well known. Whether they relate to PKPLUG is another matter.](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0013/)\n\n[#1: In November 2013, Blue Coat Labs published a report describing a case of attacks against](https://web.archive.org/web/20161017235500/https://www.bluecoat.com/security-blog/2013-11-25/plugx-used-against-mongolian-targets)\nMongolian targets using PlugX malware. Like so many other attacks using PlugX over the past\ndecade or more, Blue Coat noted the DLL side-loading technique used to launch the malicious\npayload via legitimate, signed applications. Their report also documented the group’s use of an\nexploit against software vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office. In this case, using a weaponized Word\ndocument saved as a Single File Web Page format — usually having an mht file extension — in\norder to exploit CVE-2012-0158 to drop and execute a signed WinRAR SFX archive containing\nthe side-loading package and PlugX payload. Considering all the malware related to PKPLUG\nthat Unit 42 has analyzed, the use of such exploits appears to be less common than a spearphishing technique making use of social engineering to lure victims into running their malware.\n\n[#2: A report published in April 2016 by Arbor Networks detailed recent cyber attacks using Poison](https://web.archive.org/web/20160618095613/https://www.arbornetworks.com/blog/asert/recent-poison-iv/)\nIvy malware against targets in Myanmar and other countries in Asia over the previous twelve\nmonths.\n\nThey noted phishing emails using ASEAN membership, economics and democracy-related topics\nto weaponize documents delivering the Poison Ivy payloads. While Arbor didn’t know the exact\nvictims, they inferred suspect targets based on the content of emails and associated malware.\nDLL side-loading was also mentioned as the method to install the malware.\n\n[#3: Unit 42 published research that reported attacks using the 9002 Trojan delivered through](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit-42-attack-delivers-9002-trojan-through-google-drive/)\nGoogle Drive. The download originated with a spear-phishing email containing a shortened URL\n\n\n-----\n\nredirection using HTTP also contains information about the victim who received the spear-phish\nand clicked the link. In this case, the information related to a well-known politician and human\nrights activist in Myanmar. The filename of the ZIP archive also related to initiatives in the country,\nas did the decoy document contents. The ZIP file contained a DLL side-loading package abusing\na Real Player executable signed by RealNetworks, Inc. in order to load the 9002 payload.\n\n[#4: In March 2017, researchers published a report in Japanese (later translated into English) that](http://blog.0day.jp/p/english-report-of-fhappi-freehosting.html)\ndescribed attacks seen by VKRL — a Hong Kong-based cybersecurity company — that were\nusing spear-phishing emails with URLs using GeoCities Japan to deliver malware. The content of\nthe website contained encoded VBScript that executed PowerShell commands to download a\nMicrosoft Word document from the same GeoCities site, as well as another encoded PowerShell\nscript closely resembling PowerSploit — a PowerShell post-exploitation framework for pentesters\nthat’s available on GitHub — that was responsible for decoding and launching a Poison Ivy\npayload.\n\nAnother GeoCities account was found hosting similar packages, including one targeting Mongolia\nbased on the contents of the decoy documents. The contents of the file, assuming a victim clicked\non the URL in the spear-phishing email, resembles the structure used in a technique known as\nAppLocker Bypass whereby trusted Windows executables can be used to execute malicious\npayloads.\n\n[#5: In early 2018, Unit 42 discovered a new Android malware family that we named “HenBox” and](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-henbox-chickens-come-home-roost/)\nis tracking over 400 related samples dating back as far as late 2015, and continuing to present\nday. HenBox often masquerades as legitimate Android apps and appears to primarily target the\nUyghurs — a minority Turkic ethnic group that is primarily Muslim and lives mainly in the Xinjiang\nUyghur Autonomous Region in Northwest China and also targets devices made by Chinese\nmanufacturer Xiaomi.\n\nSmartphones are the dominant form of internet access in the region and hence make good\ntargets for such malware. Once installed, HenBox steals information from a myriad of sources on\nthe device including harvesting outgoing phone calls to numbers with an “+86” prefix — the\ncountry code for the PRC — and accessing the device microphone and cameras.\n\nDuring investigations, data revealed an older version of HenBox had been downloaded from the\nuyghurapps[.]net website, which appears to be third-party Android app store serving the Uyghur\ncommunity based on the domain name, language of the site and app content hosted. HenBox\nwas masquerading as an another app — DroidVPN — which was also embedded within HenBox\nand installed post-infection.\n\n#6: Based on further investigations and pivoting around HenBox infrastructure, Unit 42 discovered\na previously-unknown Windows backdoor Trojan called Farseer. Farseer also uses the DLL sideloading technique to install payloads — this time favoring a signed Microsoft executable from\nVisualStudio to appear benign. A VBScript component is used, via a registry persistence hook, to\nlaunch the Microsoft executable and the Farseer payload during the user login process. In earlier\nFarseer variants, we saw decoy documents being used, including one case of a PDF containing a\nnews article relating to Myanmar. Mongolia also appears to be a target based on telemetry\nprovided by an industry partner of ours.\n\n\n-----\n\nFurther information relating to these publications, together with respective Indicators of\nCompromise (IoC) and Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) used, are available in the\n[PKPLUG Adversary Playbook.](https://pan-unit42.github.io/playbook_viewer/?pb=pkplug)\n\n# Tying It All Together\n\nThe following Maltego image shows the vast majority of known infrastructure and some of the\nknown malware samples related to PKPLUG, and the chart continues to grow as we discover\nmore about this adversary. The indexed shapes that overlay the figure provide a reference back\nto the published work chronology mentioned above.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2. PKPLUG Maltego diagram highlighting published research_\n\nOverlaps between the different campaigns documented, and the malware families used in them,\nexist both in infrastructure (domain names and IP addresses being reused, sometimes in multiple\ncases) and in terms of malicious traits (program runtime behaviors or static code characteristics\nare also where relationships can be found or strengthened).\n\nFigure 3 below shows a very simplified view of the six core publications again, as per Figure 2\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3. Simplified Maltego diagram showing high-level ties_\n\nThe C2 infrastructure blogged by Blue Coat Labs in their publication (#1) “PlugX used against\nMongolian targets” included ppt.bodologetee[.]com has infrastructure ties microsoftwarer[.]com\nthrough a shared IPv4 with parent domain bodologetee[.]com. Domain microsoftwarer[.]com was\nfound after threat hunting based on facts provided in publication (#4) “”FHAPPI” Campaign:\nFreeHosting APT PowerSploit Poison Ivy” in relation to the FHAPPI campaign.\n\nThe FHAPPI campaign (#4) was documented as using PowerShell and PowerSploit code in order\nto infect victims with Poison Ivy, but very similar code was also found around PlugX malware,\nsome of which had C2 communication with logitechwkgame[.]com. Domain\nlogitechwkgame[.]com was documented by Unit 42 in publication (#3) “Attack Delivers 9002\nTrojan Through Google Drive” as the C2 for the 9002 Trojans analyzed. FHAPPI is also\nconnected through another malware using C2 infrastructure that relates, through a shared IPv4\naddress, to microsoftdefence[.]com, which malware documented in Arbor Networks’ publication\n(#2) “Poison Ivy Activity Targeting Myanmar, Asian Countries” also used for C2 communication.\nOther Poison Ivy samples also related to the campaigns documented by Arbor Networks used\ndomain webserver.servehttp[.]com for C2 communication. Said samples also shared overlaps in\nruntime characteristics with other Poison Ivy samples that have been analyzed and confirmed as\nhaving C2 communications with certain domains that relate to both Blue Coat Labs’ publication\n(#1) and Unit 42’s research into Farseer malware and their publication (#6) “Farseer: Previously\nUnknown Malware Family bolsters the Chinese armoury”. Domains include\nyahoomesseges[.]com and outhmail[.]com, tcpdo[.]net, queryurl[.]com and cdncool[.]com\nrespectively. The same registrant of yahoomesseges[.]com – mongolianews@yahoo[.]com – also\nregistered ppt.bodologetee[.]com mentioned slightly earlier.\n\nSome HenBox malware has used domain cdncool[.]com as well for its C2 communications, as\ndocumented in Unit 42’s publication (#5) “The Chickens Come Home to Roost.” Domain\n\nd l[ ] i th t d t l t H B d F i b t l th h\n\n\n-----\n\nPoison Ivy malware, to the campaigns documented by Blue Coat Labs and Arbor Networks.\nHenBox is also connected through a third-level domain update.queryurl[.]com to queryurl[.]com\nthat has been used for C2 communications by some Farseer samples.\n\nOther overlaps, mainly in infrastructure also exist (as seen in Figure 2 above) but are difficult to\ndescribe in a blog like this, hence using Maltego. Figure 3, as mentioned earlier, is a simplified\ndiagram to highlight some core overlaps.\n\n# PKPLUG’s Adversary Playbook\n\n[Unit 42 has previously described and published Adversary Playbooks you can view using our](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-introducing-the-adversary-playbook-first-up-oilrig/)\n[Playbook Viewer. To recap briefly, Adversary Playbooks provide a Threat Intelligence package in](https://pan-unit42.github.io/playbook_viewer/)\nSTIX 2.0 that include all IoCs for known attacks by a given adversary. In addition, said packages\nalso include structured information about attack campaigns and adversary behaviours — their\n[TTPs) — described using Mitre’s ATT&CK framework.](https://attack.mitre.org/)\n\n[The Adversary Playbook for PKPLUG can be viewed here, and the STIX 2.0 content behind that](https://pan-unit42.github.io/playbook_viewer/?pb=pkplug)\n[can be downloaded from here. The Playbook contains several Plays (aka campaigns; instances](https://github.com/pan-unit42/playbook_viewer/blob/master/playbook_json/pkplug.json)\nof the Attack Lifecycle) that map, for the most part, to published research previously mentioned in\nthis blog. There exists Plays including specific details from publications by Blue Coat Labs, Arbor\nNetworks, our publication on the 9002 Trojan, and the FHAPPI campaign. HenBox has two Plays\n— one for the known attack compromising a third-party app store to deliver the malware and\nanother containing all other HenBox data. A similar single campaign exists for Farseer containing\nall related data.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nEstablishing a clear picture and understanding about a threat group, or groups, is virtually\nimpossible without total visibility into every one of their attack campaigns. Based on this, applying\na handle or moniker to a set of related data — such as network infrastructure, malware behavior,\nactor TTPs relating to delivery, exfiltration, etc. — helps us to better understand what it is we’re\ninvestigating. Sharing this information — with a handle, in this case PKPLUG — especially in a\nstructured, codified manner a la Adversary Playbooks, should allow others to contribute their\nvantage points and enrich said data until the understanding of a threat group becomes lucid.\n\nBased on what we know and what we’ve gleaned from others’ publications, and through industry\nsharing, PKPLUG is a threat group, or groups, operating for at least the last six years using\nseveral malware families — some more well-known: Poison Ivy, PlugX, and Zupdax; some are\nless well-known: 9002, HenBox, and Farseer. Unit 42 has been tracking the adversary for three\nyears and based on public reporting believes with high confidence that it has origins to Chinese\nnation-state adversaries. PKPLUG targets various countries or provinces in and around the\nSoutheast Asia region for multiple possible reasons as mentioned above, including some\n[countries that are members of the ASEAN organisation, some regions that are autonomous to](https://asean.org/asean/asean-member-states/)\n[China, some countries and regions somewhat involved with China’s Belt and Road Initiative, and](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/ng-interactive/2018/jul/30/what-china-belt-road-initiative-silk-road-explainer)\n[finally, some countries that are embroiled in ownership claims over the South China Sea.](https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2018/08/asia/south-china-sea/)\n\nThe Playbook Viewer helps to highlight some of the more common TTPs used by PKPLUG but,\nbased on our visibility, spear-phishing emails to deliver payloads to their victims is very popular.\n\n\n-----\n\napplications, however this technique was less commonly used compared with social engineering\nto lure the victim into opening attachments. DLL side-loading seems almost ubiquitous as a\nmethod to install or run their payloads, though perhaps more recently, PowerShell and\nPowerSploit is also being considered. Other TTPs are described in the STIX 2.0 package and\npresented in the Viewer.\n\nThe use of Android malware shows intent to get at targets where perhaps traditional computers,\noperating systems and ways of communicating are different from previous targets.\n\nPalo Alto Networks detects customers are protected by these threats through the following:\n\nCustomers using AutoFocus can view this activity by using the following tags:\n[PKPlug](https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.PKPlug)\nAll malware identified are detected as malicious by WildFire and Traps\n\n# Indicators of Compromise\n\nIndicators of compromise relating to PKPLUG can be found in the Adversary Playbook through\n[the Playbook Viewer itself, or indirectly from the STIX 2.0 JSON file powering it.](https://github.com/pan-unit42/playbook_viewer/blob/master/playbook_json/pkplug.json)\n\n## Get updates from Palo Alto Networks!\n\nSign up to receive the latest news, cyber threat intelligence and research from us\n\n[By submitting this form, you agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge our Privacy Statement.](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/legal-notices/terms-of-use)\n\n\n-----",
