Organizations should increase vigilance and evaluate their capabilities, encompassing planning, preparation,\ndetection, and response, for such an event. This section is focused on the threat of malware using enterprise-scale distributed propagation\nmethods and provides recommended guidance and considerations for an organization to address as part of their network architecture,\nsecurity baseline, continuous monitoring, and incident response practices.\n\nCISA and the FBI urge all organizations to implement the following recommendations to increase their cyber resilience against this threat.\n\n**Potential Distribution Vectors**\n\nDestructive malware may use popular communication tools to spread, including worms sent through email and instant messages, Trojan\nhorses dropped from websites, and virus-infected files downloaded from peer-to-peer connections. Malware seeks to exploit existing\nvulnerabilities on systems for quiet and easy access.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware has the capability to target a large scope of systems and can execute across multiple systems throughout a network. As a\nresult, it is important for organizations to assess their environment for atypical channels for malware delivery and/or propagation throughout\ntheir systems. Systems to assess include:\n\nEnterprise applications – particularly those that have the capability to directly interface with and impact multiple hosts and endpoints.\nCommon examples include:\n\nPatch management systems,\nAsset management systems,\nRemote assistance software (typically used by the corporate help desk),\nAntivirus (AV) software,\nSystems assigned to system and network administrative personnel,\nCentralized backup servers, and\nCentralized file shares.\n\nWhile not only applicable to malware, threat actors could compromise additional resources to impact the availability of critical data and\napplications. Common examples include:\n\nCentralized storage devices\n\nPotential risk – direct access to partitions and data warehouses.\nNetwork devices\n\nPotential risk – capability to inject false routes within the routing table, delete specific routes from the routing table,\nremove/modify, configuration attributes, or destroy firmware or system binaries—which could isolate or degrade availability of\ncritical network resources.\n\n**Best Practices and Planning Strategies**\n\nCommon strategies can be followed to strengthen an organization’s resilience against destructive malware. Targeted assessment and\nenforcement of best practices should be employed for enterprise components susceptible to destructive malware.\n\n**_Communication Flow_**\n\nEnsure proper network segmentation.\nEnsure that network-based access control lists (ACLs) are configured to permit server-to-host and host-to-host connectivity via the\nminimum scope of ports and protocols and that directional flows for connectivity are represented appropriately.\n\nCommunications flow paths should be fully defined, documented, and authorized.\nIncrease awareness of systems that can be used as a gateway to pivot (lateral movement) or directly connect to additional endpoints\nthroughout the enterprise.\n\nEnsure that these systems are contained within restrictive Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs), with additional segmentation\nand network access controls.\nEnsure that centralized network and storage devices’ management interfaces reside on restrictive VLANs.\n\nLayered access control, and\nDevice-level access control enforcement – restricting access from only pre-defined VLANs and trusted IP ranges.\n\n**_Access Control_**\n\nFor enterprise systems that can directly interface with multiple endpoints:\n\nRequire multifactor authentication for interactive logons.\nEnsure that authorized users are mapped to a specific subset of enterprise personnel.\n\nIf possible, the “Everyone,” “Domain Users,” or the “Authenticated Users” groups should not be permitted the capability to\ndirectly access or authenticate to these systems.\nEnsure that unique domain accounts are used and documented for each enterprise application service.\n\nContext of permissions assigned to these accounts should be fully documented and configured based upon the concept of\nleast privilege.\nProvides an enterprise with the capability to track and monitor specific actions correlating to an application’s assigned\nservice account.\nIf possible, do not grant a service account with local or interactive logon permissions.\n\nService accounts should be explicitly denied permissions to access network shares and critical data locations.\nAccounts that are used to authenticate to centralized enterprise application servers or devices should not contain elevated\npermissions on downstream systems and resources throughout the enterprise.\nContinuously review centralized file share ACLs and assigned permissions.\n\nRestrict Write/Modify/Full Control permissions when possible.\n\n**_Monitoring_**\n\n\n-----\n\nAudit and review security logs for anomalous references to enterprise level administrative (privileged) and service accounts.\n\nFailed logon attempts,\nFile share access, and\nInteractive logons via a remote session.\nReview network flow data for signs of anomalous activity, including:\n\nConnections using ports that do not correlate to the standard communications flow associated with an application,\nActivity correlating to port scanning or enumeration, and\nRepeated connections using ports that can be used for command and control purposes.\nEnsure that network devices log and audit all configuration changes.\n\nContinually review network device configurations and rule sets to ensure that communications flows are restricted to the\nauthorized subset of rules.\n\n**_File Distribution_**\n\nWhen deploying patches or AV signatures throughout an enterprise, stage the distributions to include a specific grouping of systems\n(staggered over a pre-defined period).\n\nThis action can minimize the overall impact in the event that an enterprise patch management or AV system is leveraged as a\ndistribution vector for a malicious payload.\nMonitor and assess the integrity of patches and AV signatures that are distributed throughout the enterprise.\n\nEnsure updates are received only from trusted sources,\nPerform file and data integrity checks, and\nMonitor and audit – as related to the data that is distributed from an enterprise application.\n\n**_System and Application Hardening_**\n\nEnsure robust vulnerability management and patching practices are in place.\n\nCISA maintains [a living catalog of known exploited vulnerabilities that carry significant risk to federal agencies as well as public](https://cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities)\nand private sectors entities. In addition to thoroughly testing and implementing vendor patches in a timely—and, if possible,\nautomated— manner, organizations should ensure patching of the vulnerabilities CISA includes in this catalog.\nEnsure that the underlying operating system (OS) and dependencies (e.g., Internet Information Services [IIS], Apache, Structured\nQuery Language [SQL]) supporting an application are configured and hardened based upon industry-standard best practice\nrecommendations. Implement application-level security controls based on best practice guidance provided by the vendor. Common\nrecommendations include:\n\nUse role-based access control,\nPrevent end-user capabilities to bypass application-level security controls,\n\nFor example, do not allow users to disable AV on local workstations.\nRemove, or disable unnecessary or unused features or packages, and\nImplement robust application logging and auditing.\n\n**_Recovery and Reconstitution Planning_**\n\nA [business impact analysis (BIA) is a key component of contingency planning and preparation. The overall output of a BIA will provide an](https://www.ready.gov/business-impact-analysis)\norganization with two key components (as related to critical mission/business operations):\n\nCharacterization and classification of system components, and\nInterdependencies.\n\nBased upon the identification of an organization’s mission critical assets (and their associated interdependencies), in the event that an\norganization is impacted by destructive malware, recovery and reconstitution efforts should be considered.\n\nTo plan for this scenario, an organization should address the availability and accessibility for the following resources (and should include\nthe scope of these items within incident response exercises and scenarios):\n\nComprehensive inventory of all mission critical systems and applications:\n\nVersioning information,\nSystem/application dependencies,\nSystem partitioning/storage configuration and connectivity, and\nAsset owners/points of contact.\nContact information for all essential personnel within the organization,\nSecure communications channel for recovery teams,\nContact information for external organizational-dependent resources:\n\nCommunication providers,\nVendors (hardware/software), and\nOutreach partners/external stakeholders\nService contract numbers – for engaging vendor support,\nOrganizational procurement points of contact,\n\n\n-----\n\nOptical disc image (ISO)/image files for baseline restoration of critical systems and applications:\n\nOS installation media,\nService packs/patches,\nFirmware, and\nApplication software installation packages.\nLicensing/activation keys for OS and dependent applications,\nEnterprise network topology and architecture diagrams,\nSystem and application documentation,\nHard copies of operational checklists and playbooks,\nSystem and application configuration backup files,\nData backup files (full/differential),\nSystem and application security baseline and hardening checklists/guidelines, and\nSystem and application integrity test and acceptance checklists.\n\n**_Incident Response_**\n\nVictims of a destructive malware attacks should immediately focus on containment to reduce the scope of affected systems. Strategies for\ncontainment include:\n\nDetermining a vector common to all systems experiencing anomalous behavior (or having been rendered unavailable)—from which a\nmalicious payload could have been delivered:\n\nCentralized enterprise application,\nCentralized file share (for which the identified systems were mapped or had access),\nPrivileged user account common to the identified systems,\nNetwork segment or boundary, and\nCommon Domain Name System (DNS) server for name resolution.\nBased upon the determination of a likely distribution vector, additional mitigation controls can be enforced to further minimize impact:\n\nImplement network-based ACLs to deny the identified application(s) the capability to directly communicate with additional\nsystems,\n\nProvides an immediate capability to isolate and sandbox specific systems or resources.\nImplement null network routes for specific IP addresses (or IP ranges) from which the payload may be distributed,\n\nAn organization’s internal DNS can also be leveraged for this task, as a null pointer record could be added within a DNS\nzone for an identified server or application.\nReadily disable access for suspected user or service account(s),\nFor suspect file shares (which may be hosting the infection vector), remove access or disable the share path from being\naccessed by additional systems, and\nBe prepared to, if necessary, reset all passwords and tickets within directories (e.g., changing golden/silver tickets).\n\nAs related to incident response and incident handling, organizations are encouraged to report incidents to the FBI and CISA (see the\nContact section below) and to preserve forensic data for use in internal investigation of the incident or for possible law enforcement\n[purposes.

The binaries are\npredominantly `.Net and are obfuscated. Obfuscation varies; some of the binaries contain multiple layers of obfuscation. Analysis`\nidentified multiple uses of string reversal, character replacement, base64 encoding, and packing. Additionally, the malicious binaries\ncontain multiple defenses including VM checks, sandbox detection and evasion, and anti-debugging techniques. Finally, the sleep\ncommand was used in varying lengths via PowerShell to obfuscate execution on a victim’s network.\nAll Microsoft `.doc files contain a malicious macro that is base64 encoded. Upon enabling the macro, a PowerShell script runs a sleep`\ncommand and then downloads a file from an external site. The script connects to the external website via HTTP to download an\nexecutable. Upon download, the executable is saved to `C:\\Users\\Public\\Documents\\ filepath on the victim host.`\nAn identified zip file was found to contain the Microsoft Word file macro_t1smud.doc. Once the macro is enabled, a bash script runs a\nsleep command and the script connects to `htxxps://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/w32/putty.exe .
