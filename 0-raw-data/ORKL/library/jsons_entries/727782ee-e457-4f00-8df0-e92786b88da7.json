Secureworks says hackers from Iran similar to those indicted in\n[March have been trying to steal credentials. ( Flickr user daniyal62)](https://flic.kr/p/G5yUdE)\nWritten by [Patrick Howell O'Neill](https://www.cyberscoop.com/author/oneill/)\n\nAug 24, 2018 | CYBERSCOOP\nA mass credential-stealing campaign by hackers linked to the Iranian government and\ntargeting 76 universities around the world was discovered this month by Secureworks, an\nAtlanta-based cybersecurity company owned by Dell.\n\nThe campaign involved 16 domains, 300 spoofed websites and fake login pages, 76 targeted\nuniversities and 14 countries including the United States, Canada, United Kingdom and\nJapan, the company announced.\n\n“Universities are attractive targets for threat actors interested in obtaining intellectual\nproperty,” Secureworks’ researchers said on Friday. “In addition to being more difficult to\nsecure than heavily regulated finance or healthcare organizations, universities are known to\ndevelop cutting-edge research and can attract global researchers and students.”\n\n\n-----\n\nThe campaign is ongoing with the most recent domain having been registered on Aug. 19.\n\nCarried out by hackers that Secureworks researchers dub Cobalt Dickens, this campaign\n[used some of the same infrastructure as the Iranian hackers indicted by the United States in](https://www.cyberscoop.com/us-government-indicts-iran-mabna-institute/)\nMarch 2018, according to the company’s research, indicating a strong link to Tehran.\n\nNine Iranian nationals were indicted on March 23 for allegedly hacking into the networks of\nmultiple U.S. universities, government agencies and businesses in an effort to steal\nintellectual property and use the high bandwidth networks for future operations. Deputy\nAttorney General Rod Rosenstein said the hackers, who stole more than 31 terabytes of\ndata from U.S. targets, acted at the command of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps.\n\nThe hackers work for the Mabna Institute, a quasi-government technology firm in Iran.\n\n“We’re focusing on people who support IRGC (Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps) in some\nof their cyber operations,” a senior U.S. official told CyberScoop in March. “They have this\ndual personality where they’ve been hacking for profit as well as hacking information, which\nthey sell to the Iranian government, as well as provide capabilities to the Iranian\ngovernment.”\n\nIn addition to the shared infrastructure, the researchers at Secureworks pointed to the similar\ngoals and tactics.\n\n“The targeting of online academic resources is similar to previous cyber operations by\nCOBALT DICKENS, a threat group associated with the Iranian government,” the researchers\nwrote. “In those operations, which also shared infrastructure with the August attacks, the\nthreat group created lookalike domains to phish targets and used credentials to steal\nintellectual property from specific resources, including library systems.”\n\n\n-----",
