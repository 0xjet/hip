This\nactivity involved access to the Department’s Microsoft O365 email environment.\n\nAfter learning of the malicious activity, the OCIO eliminated the identified method by which\nthe actor was accessing the O365 email environment. At this point, the number of potentially\naccessed O365 mailboxes appears limited to around 3-percent and we have no indication\nthat any classified systems were impacted.\n\nAs part of the ongoing technical analysis, the Department has determined that the activity\nconstitutes a major incident under the Federal Information Security Modernization Act, and is\ntaking the steps consistent with that determination. The Department will continue to notify\nthe appropriate federal agencies, Congress, and the public as warranted.\"\n\nComponent(s):\n\n[Office of Public Affairs](http://www.justice.gov/opa/)\nPress Release Number:\n\n\n-----\n\n21-11\n\n\n-----",
