How malware has evolved over the last 10 years\n\n**ptsecurity.com/ww-en/analytics/antisandbox-techniques/**\n\n## Contents\n\n Introduction\n\nIn most cases, hackers \"case out\" their targets before attacking. They do this by collecting\ninformation about the system and internal network, which gives an idea of how they can\nprofit from an attack and helps to plan further actions. Of course, the attackers need to be\nsure they have accessed a real workstation on a company's infrastructure, and not a mere\nsandbox—a virtual environment designed to analyze the behavior of executable files. That is\nwhy modern malware has capabilities for detecting and evading protection mechanisms, as\nwell as for hiding malicious functionality if run in a sandbox or code analyzer.\n\nWe have analyzed 36 malware families used by at least 23 APT groups around the world\nduring the period from 2010 through the first half of 2020. The selection was made based on\n[MITRE data and information about new malware samples analyzed by the PT Expert](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1497/)\nSecurity Center.\n\nIn this research, we will show how sandbox evasion techniques have evolved in the last 10\nyears.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhat is a sandbox\n\nSandboxes run a file in an isolated virtual environment, analyze the actions performed by the\nfile, and issue a verdict that answers the all-important question: is the file safe or not?\nSandboxes can be agent-based or agentless.\n\n\nAgentbased\nsandboxes\n\nAgentless\nsandboxes\n\n\nThe virtual machine has a built-in agent (special process) that manages the\nsystem, in addition to getting and passing events and artifacts of interest.\nWhen a new process is generated, the sandbox intercepts API function calls\n(changes to an address in process memory or changes to code in a function\nbody).\n\nThis approach has one significant drawback: the sandbox needs to conceal\nand protect agent-related objects from malware.\n\nThese sandboxes use second level address translation (SLAT), a form of\nhardware-assisted virtualization built into CPUs. AMD processors support\nSLAT through Rapid Virtualization Indexing (RVI), while Intel's\nimplementation is known as Extended Page Table (EPT).\n\nExtended page tables are nested between the guest physical memory and\nthe host virtual memory. This allows to do the following:\n\nExamine memory pages of the guest machine.\nIdentify important parts (for example, parts containing addresses or\ncode of kernel functions).\nMark selected pages to separate EPT memory access rights from guest\nmachine access rights.\nIntercept attempts to access marked memory regions (if this happens,\nan EPT violation error will occur and the guest machine will be\nstopped).\nAnalyze the memory state and extract information about an event.\nMark the memory page anew to return it to the correct state.\nRestore operation of the guest machine..\nAll these actions are observed from outside the sandbox: malware\ncannot detect that it is being watched.\n\n\n## Executive summary\n\nSandbox evasion and anti-analysis techniques are found most frequently in remote access\ntools (accounting for 56% of the malware in our dataset) and loaders (14%). These types of\nmalware are used to perform reconnaissance and gather information about the target\n\n\n-----\n\nsystem. If attackers spot that their malware is running inside a virtual environment, they will\nnot continue their attack and will not download the payload. Instead, they will attempt to\nmaintain stealth by terminating execution of the malware.\n\nFigure 1. Types of malware\n\n69 percent of the malware samples in our dataset were used for cyberespionage. Such\nattacks require staying invisible on a victim's system for extended periods, which is why\nattackers look for ways to maintain long-term, stealthy persistence.\n\nFigure 2. Attacker motives\n\nTo detect virtual machines (sandboxes), attackers send WMI queries (25% of malware in the\ndataset), perform other environment checks (33%), or check which processes are running\n(19%). Attackers can also use information about the virtualization environment to plan their\nfuture efforts.\n\nFigure 3. Popular sandbox evasion and anti-analysis methods (percentage of malware)\n\nIt is getting more and more difficult to perform static analysis of malicious files by matching\nsuspicious files with known signatures and hash sums, because malware authors are using\ncode obfuscation to impede analysis attempts. That is why we recommend analyzing file\nbehavior in a sandbox.\n\n## Evolution of anti-sandbox techniques\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4. Sandbox evasion and anti-analysis methods used by malware in 2010–2020\n[Download Timeline](https://www.ptsecurity.com/upload/corporate/ww-en/images/analytics/article-316541/TimeLine_eng.pdf)\n\nTo evade sandboxes and analysis tools, the same malware may use different methods in\ndifferent years. Threat actors also try to combine multiple methods. If one method does not\nwork and is intercepted by the sandbox, the malware can still use other signs to determine\nwhether it is running in a virtual environment and, if so, terminate itself in time to avoid\ndiscovery.\n\nAPT group [Ke3chang (also known as APT15) used the MyWeb backdoor in 2010, BS2005in](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0004/)\n[2014, and Okrum in 2016–2019. They used a number of methods for evading and detecting](https://welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ESET_Okrum_and_Ketrican.pdf)\nvirtual machines and code analyzers. They checked for human interaction by waiting for\nthree left clicks or locating the cursor position, and determined the amount of physical\nmemory by calling GetGlobalMemoryStatusEx or by sending WMI queries.\n\nHere are several more examples:\n\n### ROKRAT\n\n\n-----\n\n**Type: RAT**\n\n**Group:** [APT37, active since 2012](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0067/)\n\n**Target: organizations in South Korea**\n\n**Infection vector: phishing (phishing emails with malicious HWP attachments exploiting**\nvulnerability CVE-2013-0808)\n\n**Motive:espionage**\n\n**Sandbox evasion and anti-analysis methods used** **2016** **2018**\n\n\nChecking whether the SbieDll.dll, Dbghelp.dll, Api_log.dll, or Dir_watch.dll\nlibraries are loaded\n\nObtaining the value of the SystemBiosVersion key of the\nHARDWARE\\DESCRIPTION\\System registry branch\n\nUsing the NOP (No Operation) instruction as padding in self-modifying code\nto protect from debuggers\n\n\n**+** **+**\n\n**+** **-**\n\n**+** **-**\n\n\nCalling the IsDebuggerPresent function to detect debugging **-** **+**\n\nCalling the GetTickCount function twice to check for step-through execution **-** **+**\n\nChecking for the file C:\\Program Files\\VMware\\VMware Tools\\vmtoolsd.exe **-** **+**\n\n### RogueRobin\n\n**Type: RAT**\n\n**Group:** [DarkHydrus, active since 2016](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0079/)\n\n**Target: government agencies and educational institutions in the Middle East**\n\n**Infection vector: phishing (malicious Microsoft Office documents distributed via Google**\nDrive)\n\n**Motive: espionage**\n\n**Sandbox evasion and anti-analysis methods used** **2018** **2019**\n\nSending WMI queries to get the BIOS version and manufacturer **+** **+**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Sandbox evasion and anti-analysis methods used** **2018** **2019**\n\n\nSending WMI queries to check the number of CPU cores; the value must\nexceed 1\n\nSending WMI queries to check the amount of physical memory; the value\nmust be at least 2,900,000,000 bytes\n\n\n**+** **+**\n\n**+** **+**\n\n\nChecking the number of running processes for Wireshark and Sysinternals **+** **+**\n\nObfuscating a PowerShell script with Invoke-Obfuscation **+** **+**\n\nChecking for debuggers in each DNS request **-** **+**\n\n### Remcos\n\n**Type: RAT**\n\n**Group:** [Gorgon Group, active since 2018](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0078/)\n\n**Target: government organizations in Russia, the United Kingdom, Spain, and the United**\nStates\n\n**Infection vector: phishing (emails with malicious Microsoft Word documents exploiting**\nvulnerability CVE-2017-0199)\n\n**Motive: espionage**\n\n**Sandbox evasion and anti-analysis methods used** **2018** **2019**\n\nChecking for obsolete SbieDll.dll system artifact **+** **-**\n\nEncrypting source code with RC4 and Base64 algorithms **+** **+**\n\nChecking active processes for vmtoolsd.exe and vbox.exe **-** **+**\n\n\nCalling the IsDebuggerPresent function to check whether the process that\ncalls the function is being run in a debugger context\n\n\n**-** **+**\n\n\n-----\n\nIn 2018–2019, the number of malware families using sandbox evasion techniques increased.\nHowever, this statistic is likely explained by the fact that experts now investigate malware\nsamples more often.\n\nAttackers [who sell malware on the darkweb also offer functionality for detecting and evading](https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/analytics/advanced-persistent-threat-apt-attack-cost-report/)\nsandboxes and antivirus tools, as well as for countering analysis and debugging. The starting\nprice for malware with built-in sandbox evasion is $30. Additional protection from detection\nby sandboxes and antivirus solutions costs $20.\n\nFigure 5.

Advertisement for malware with built-in virtualization evasion functionality\n\n## Popular virtualization evasion techniques\n\n### Checking running processes\n\nUsed in EvilBunny, FinFisher, PlugX, Remcos, RogueRobin, Smoke Loader, PipeMon,\nSnake\n\nOne fifth of malware analyzes the list of running processes to detect a virtual environment.\nFor example:\n\nThe [EvilBunny RAT continues execution only if at least 15 processes are running.](https://web.archive.org/web/20150311013500/http:/www.cyphort.com/evilbunny-malware-instrumented-lua/)\n[PlugX (a backdoor widely used by APT groups over the last 10 years) checks if](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-paranoid-plugx/)\nVMware Tools are running in background by searching for processes named\n\"vmtoolsd\".\n[Remcos, used by Gorgon Group in phishing attacks against governments, searches for](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/08/picking-apart-remcos.html)\n\"vmtoolsd\" and \"vbox.exe\" in the list of active processes.\n\nFigure 8.\n\nSearching for vmtoolsd (Remcos)\n\n### WMI queries\n\n\n-----\n\nUsed in BadPatch, Fin7, GravityRAT, OopsIE, Pony, RogueRobin\n\nSince 2016, malware developers have been actively using WMI queries Windows\nManagement Instrumentation (WMI) is a technology for centralized management of\nWindows-based infrastructures. to access devices, accounts, services, processes, network\ninterfaces, and other programs. Of the malware in question, 25 percent makes use of them.\nIn most cases, the attackers are trying to find out the model of hard drive or motherboard, as\nwell as OS and BIOS versions.\n\n[GravityRAT uses an interesting method to detect virtual environments. By sending the](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/04/gravityrat-two-year-evolution-of-apt.html)\nSELECT * FROM MSAcpi_ThermalZoneTemperature WMI query, it checks the CPU\ntemperature: if the malware is being run on a physical machine, the temperature value will be\nreturned. But if the system responds with \"ERROR\" or \"Not Supported,\" this means that the\nmalware is running in a virtual environment.\n\nFigure 9. Output for the query SELECT * FROM MSAcpi_ThermalZoneTemperature on a\nphysical machine\n\nFigure 10. Output for the query SELECT * FROM MSAcpi_ThermalZoneTemperature in a\nvirtual environment\n[WMI queries have also been used by the OilRig group (APT34, Helix Kitten), which for more](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0049/)\nthan five years has targeted a variety of industries, including government, finance, energy,\n[and telecommunications, primarily in the Middle East. The group's backdoor OopsIE sends](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-oilrig-targets-middle-eastern-government-adds-evasion-techniques-oopsie/)\nthe WMI query SELECT * FROM Win32_Fan to check the state of the CPU fan. This query\nshould return a class that provides statistics on the CPU fan. The backdoor checks whether\nthe response is empty, which would indicate a virtual environment.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 11. Output for the query SELECT * FROM Win32_Fan on a physical machine\n\nFigure 12. Output for the query SELECT * FROM Win32_Fan in a virtual environment\n\n### Registry key values checks\n\nUsed in CozyCar, Smoke Loader, FinFisher, GravityRAT, ROKRAT\n\nSome malware (14 percent) reads registry key values and looks for substrings in them that\nsuggest a virtual machine. For example:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe [Smoke Loaderbanking trojan, used by TA505, checks registry key values in](https://research.checkpoint.com/2019/2019-resurgence-of-smokeloader/)\nSystem\\CurrentControlSet\\Enum\\IDE and System\\CurrentControlSet\\Enum\\SCSI to\nsearch for substrings that match QEMU, VirtualBox, VMware, or Xen virtualization\nproducts. Smoke Loader (Smoke Bot) is offered for sale on the darkweb. The complete\nmalware package costs $1,650.\n\nFigure 13. Smoke Bot banking malware for sale\n\nFigure 14. Price of Smoke Bot banking malware on the darkweb\n\n[FinFisher verifies that HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Cryptography\\MachineGuid does](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2018/03/01/finfisher-exposed-a-researchers-tale-of-defeating-traps-tricks-and-complex-virtual-machines/)\nnot equal \"6ba1d002-21ed-4dbe-afb5-08cf8b81ca32\";\nHKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\DigitalProductId does not\nequal \"55274-649-6478953-23109\", \"A22-00001\", or \"47220\", and that\nHARDWARE\\Description\\System\\SystemBiosDate does not contain \"01/02/03\".\n\n\n-----\n\n[CozyCar used by APT29, checks the registry key values in](https://securelist.com/the-cozyduke-apt/69731/)\nSOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall for security products to\navoid.\n\n### Other environment checks\n\nIn addition to checking running processes, registry key values, and sending WMI queries,\n[malefactors can check the environment in other ways. For example, the RTM (Redaman)](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/russian-language-malspam-pushing-redaman-banking-malware/)\nbanking trojan checks for the following files and directories on C:\\ and D:\\ drives:\n\ncuckoo,\nfake_drive,\nperl,\nstrawberry,\ntargets.xls,\ntsl,\nwget.exe,\n*python*.\n\nThe existence of any of these files or directories indicates that the malware is running in a\nsandbox or a code analyzer.\n\n[APT37 (also known as ScarCruft, Group123, and TEMP.Reaper) has modified its ROKRAT](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0067/)\nbackdoor over the last several years. In addition to checking registry key values, this\nmalware also checks whether the file C:\\Program Files\\VMware\\VMware Tools\\vmtoolsd.exe\nexists and whether the following code analyzer and debugger DLLs have been loaded:\n\nSbieDll.dll,\nDbghelp.dll,\nApi_log.dll,\nDir_watch.dll.\n\nCorrectly configuring virtual machines is enough to stop the following attacker technique.\n[PoetRAT, remote access malware, used in targeted attacks against ICS and SCADA](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2020/04/poetrat-covid-19-lures.html)\nsystems in the energy sector, checks the hard disk size to determine whether it is running in\na sandbox environment. Since the malware assumes that sandboxes have hard drives of\nless than 62 GB, it can be tricked by allocating more space for the virtual machine.\n\n### Does a sandbox have to detect all evasion techniques\n\nNot all sandbox evasion methods are easy to detect. Some checks—such as file path, MAC\naddress, date and time, and operation execution time—strongly resemble legitimate actions.\nDetection may generate a large number of false positives and interfere with proper\nfunctioning of other programs. This, however, does not mean that malware will remain totally\ninvisible. Sandboxes do not have to catch each and every evasion technique, since malware\n\n\n-----\n\nhas many other attributes that can be detected at other stages of operation. That said, the\nmore techniques the sandbox sees, the greater the chances of detecting new malware\nsamples and applying this information to counter cyberthreats.\n\n## Anti-analysis and anti-debugging\n\nTo slip past antivirus programs for as long as possible, malefactors try to prevent analysis of\nmalware by security professionals. They do so by using code obfuscation and antidebugging techniques.\n\nIn 2019, the [Remcos RAT added an anti-debugging method to its arsenal. If the loader](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/19/h/analysis-new-remcos-rat-arrives-via-phishing-email.html?utm_source=trendmicroresearch&utm_medium=socal)\ndetects a debugger in the system after calling the IsDebuggerPresent function, it displays the\nmessage \"This is a third-party compiled AutoIt script\" and terminates execution.\n\nThe authors of [FinFisher spyware went to great effort to obfuscate malicious code and](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2018/03/01/finfisher-exposed-a-researchers-tale-of-defeating-traps-tricks-and-complex-virtual-machines/)\nimpede analysis. For example, opcode 0x1A should represent a JB (Jump if below) function,\nbut is implemented through a set carry (STC) instruction followed by a JMP to the dispatcher\ncode which will verify the carry flag condition set by STC.\n\nFigure 15. Example of an obfuscation technique (FinFisher)\n[To check for the step-through execution normally used by debuggers, EvilBunny calls](https://web.archive.org/web/20150311013500/http:/www.cyphort.com/evilbunny-malware-instrumented-lua/)\nNtQuerySystemTime, GetSystemTimeAsFileTime, and GetTickCount. It calls each function\ntwice to calculate a delta and performs a sleep operation between the first and second calls.\nIf any of the three deltas is below 998 milliseconds, execution will terminate.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 16. Double calling of\n\nfunctions (EvilBunny)\nIt is getting more and more difficult to perform static analysis of malware and identify\nattributes of malicious files by matching them with signatures and hash sums. That is why, in\naddition to static analysis, we recommend running suspicious files in a virtual environment to\nanalyze their behavior.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n\n-----\n\nAttackers constantly modify their malware to evade detection for as long as possible. In this\nrespect, APT groups do especially well. To collect information about the victim's\ninfrastructure, attackers prefer using malware with built-in functionality for detecting and\nevading virtual machines and code analyzers. In addition, loaders and remote access tools\nsold on the darkweb have built-in basic sandbox evasion functions, or at least this is what\ntheir sellers claim.\n\nIn recent years, malware authors have been trying especially hard to evade code analyzers.\nHackers do all they can to hide malicious functionality from security researchers and\nminimize the likelihood of detection of malware based on known indicators of compromise.\nTraditional defenses may not be able to detect malicious programs. To detect modern\nmalware, we recommend analyzing file behavior in a secure virtual environment. By using a\nsandbox, you also enrich your IOC database and can leverage this information to better\nrespond to cyberthreats. By updating all your protection tools with the latest IOCs, you can\ndetect even new malware versions if hackers attempt a second attack on your infrastructure.\nFor example, if attackers compile a new malware version but forget to change the command\nand control (C2) address, the newer malware will still be detected because of the identical\naddress.\n\nSandboxes have already learned to thwart the majority of popular evasion techniques. Even\nif hackers use methods that resemble legitimate processes, such as checking the current\ndate and time, malware will most likely reveal itself by other signs a sandbox will be able to\ndetect. Hackers constantly refine their tools, change sandbox detection techniques, and use\nmultiple techniques at the same time. In parallel, sandboxes must be flexible enough and\neasily adapt to new challenges by imitating a real workstation. A sandbox must hide its\npresence well in order to prevent malware from terminating early and successfully collect\nindicators of compromise.\n\n\n-----",
