    "plain_text": "# Hydrochasma: Previously Unknown Group Targets Medical and Shipping Organizations in Asia\n\n**symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/hydrochasma-asia-medical-shipping-intelligence-**\ngathering\n\nShipping companies and medical laboratories in Asia are being targeted in a likely\nintelligence-gathering campaign that relies exclusively on publicly available and living-offthe-land tools.\n\nHydrochasma, the threat actor behind this campaign, has not been linked to any previously\nidentified group, but appears to have a possible interest in industries that may be involved in\nCOVID-19-related treatments or vaccines.\n\nThis activity has been ongoing since at least October 2022. While Symantec, by Broadcom\nSoftware, did not see any data being exfiltrated in this campaign, the targets, as well as some\nof the tools used, indicate that the most likely motivation in this campaign is intelligence\ngathering.\n\n## Attack Chain\n\nThe infection vector used by Hydrochasma was most likely a phishing email. The first\nsuspicious activity seen on machines is a lure document with a file name in the victim\norganization’s native language that appears to indicate it was an email attachment:\n\n_[TRANSLATED FROM THE ORIGINAL] Product Specification-Freight-Company_\n_Qualification Information wps-pdf Export.pdf.exe_\n\nAnother lure document appears to be mimicking a resume:\n\n_[TRANSLATED FROM THE ORIGINAL] [REDACTED] University-Development_\n_Engineer.exe_\n\nFollowing initial access on one machine, the attackers were seen dropping Fast Reverse\nProxy (FRP), a tool that can expose a local server that is sitting behind an NAT or firewall to\nthe internet. This drops a legitimate Microsoft Edge update file:\n\n_%TEMP%\\MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe_\n\nAnother file, %TEMP%\\msedgeupdate.dll, is then seen on victim machines. But this file is\nactually Meterpreter, a tool that is part of the Metasploit framework and which can be used\nfor remote access.\n\nOther tools that were subsequently seen on this victim’s network included:\n\n\n-----\n\n**Gogo scanning tool: An automated scanning engine originally designed for use by**\nred teams.\n**Process Dumper (lsass.exe): A tool that allows attackers to dump domain**\npasswords.\n**Cobalt Strike Beacon: An off-the-shelf tool that can be used to execute commands,**\ninject other processes, elevate current processes, or impersonate other processes, and\nupload and download files. It ostensibly has legitimate uses as a penetration testing tool\nbut is invariably exploited by malicious actors.\n**AlliN scanning tool: A pentesting scan tool that can be used for lateral penetration of**\nthe intranet.\n**Fscan: A publicly available hacktool that can scan for open ports and more.**\n**Dogz proxy tool: A free VPN proxy tool.**\n\nA shellcode loader and a corrupted portable executable (PE) file were also deployed on this\nvictim’s network.\n\nOther tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) observed being used in this campaign\nincluded:\n\n**SoftEtherVPN: The presence of this tool was what first prompted Symantec**\nresearchers to investigate this activity. It is free, open-source, and cross-platform VPN\nsoftware.\n**Procdump: Microsoft Sysinternals tool for monitoring an application for CPU spikes**\nand generating crash dumps, but which can also be used as a general process dump\nutility.\n**BrowserGhost: A publicly available tool that can grab passwords from an internet**\nbrowser.\n**Gost proxy: A tunneling tool.**\n**Ntlmrelay: An NTLM relay attack allows an attacker to intercept validated**\nauthentication requests in order to access network services.\n**Task Scheduler: Allows tasks to be automated on a computer.**\n**Go-strip: Used to make a Go binary smaller in size.**\n**HackBrowserData: An open-source tool that can decrypt browser data.**\n\nThe tools deployed by Hydrochasma indicate a desire to achieve persistent and stealthy\naccess to victim machines, as well as an effort to escalate privileges and spread laterally\nacross victim networks.\n\nWhile Symantec researchers didn’t observe data being exfiltrated from victim machines,\nsome of the tools deployed by Hydrochasma do allow for remote access and could potentially\nbe used to exfiltrate data. The sectors targeted also point towards the motivation behind this\nattack being intelligence gathering.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe lack of custom malware used in this attack is also notable. Relying exclusively on livingoff-the-land and publicly available tools can help make an attack stealthier, while also\nmaking attribution more difficult. Symantec did not see evidence to link this activity to a\nknown actor, prompting us to create the new actor identity of Hydrochasma for those behind\nthis activity.\n\n## Protection/Mitigation\n\n[For
