See the ATT&CK for Enterprise version 7](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/enterprise/)_ _for all referenced threat_\n_actor tactics and techniques._\n\n### SUMMARY\n\nThis joint cybersecurity advisory was coauthored by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security\nAgency (CISA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Department of Health and Human\nServices (HHS). This advisory describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by\ncybercriminals against targets in the Healthcare and Public Health Sector (HPH) to infect systems\nwith ransomware, notably Ryuk and Conti, for financial gain.\n\nCISA, FBI, and HHS have credible information of an increased and imminent cybercrime threat to\nU.S. hospitals and healthcare providers. CISA, FBI, and HHS are sharing this information to provide\nwarning to healthcare providers to ensure that they take timely and reasonable precautions to protect\ntheir networks from these threats.\n\n#### Key Findings\n\n  - CISA, FBI, and HHS assess malicious cyber actors are targeting the HPH Sector with TrickBot\nand BazarLoader malware, often leading to ransomware attacks, data theft, and the disruption\nof healthcare services.\n\n  - These issues will be particularly challenging for organizations within the COVID-19 pandemic;\ntherefore, administrators will need to balance this risk when determining their cybersecurity\ninvestments.\n\n### TECHNICAL DETAILS\n\n#### Threat Details\n\nThe cybercriminal enterprise behind TrickBot, which is likely also the creator of BazarLoader\nmalware, has continued to develop new functionality and tools, increasing the ease, speed, and\nprofitability of victimization. These threat actors increasingly use loaders—like TrickBot and\nBazarLoader (or BazarBackdoor)—as part of their malicious cyber campaigns. Cybercriminals\n\n_To report suspicious or criminal activity related to information found in this Joint Cybersecurity Advisory, contact_\n_your local FBI field office at_ _www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field,_ _or the FBI’s 24/7 Cyber Watch (CyWatch) at_\n_(855) 292-3937 or by e-mail at_ _CyWatch@fbi.gov._ _When available, please include the following information_\n_regarding the incident: date, time, and location of the incident; type of activity; number of people affected; type of_\n_equipment used for the activity; the name of the submitting company or organization; and a designated point of_\n_contact. To request incident response resources or technical assistance related to these threats, contact CISA at_\n\n_central@cisa.gov._\n\n_This document is marked TLP:WHITE. Disclosure is not limited. Sources may use TLP:WHITE when information_\n_carries minimal or no foreseeable risk of misuse, in accordance with applicable rules and procedures for public_\n_release. Subject to standard copyright rules, TLP:WHITE information may be distributed without restriction._\n_For more information on the Traffic Light Protocol, see_ _[http://www.us-cert.gov/tlp/.](http://www.us-cert.gov/tlp/)_\n\nPage 2 of 22 | Prod ct ID AA20 302A\n\n\nCISA | FBI | HHS\n\n\n-----\n\nCISA | FBI | HHS\n**TLP:WHITE**\n\ndisseminate TrickBot and BazarLoader via phishing campaigns that contain either links to malicious\nwebsites that host the malware or attachments with the malware. Loaders start the infection chain by\ndistributing the payload; they deploy and execute the backdoor from the C2 server and install it on the\nvictim’s machine.\n\n##### TrickBot\n\nWhat began as a banking trojan and descendant of Dyre malware, TrickBot now provides its\noperators a full suite of tools to conduct a myriad of illegal cyber activities. These activities include\ncredential harvesting, mail exfiltration, cryptomining, point-of-sale data exfiltration, and the\ndeployment of ransomware, such as Ryuk and Conti.\n\nIn early 2019, FBI began to observe new TrickBot modules named Anchor, which cyber actors\ntypically used in attacks targeting high-profile victims—such as large corporations. These attacks\noften involved data exfiltration from networks and point-of-sale devices. As part of the new Anchor\ntoolset, TrickBot developers created anchor_dns, a tool for sending and receiving data from victim\nmachines using Domain Name System (DNS) tunneling.\n```\n   anchor_dns is a backdoor that allows victim machines to communicate with command and control\n\n```\n(C2) servers over DNS to evade typical network defense products and make their malicious\ncommunications blend in with legitimate DNS traffic. anchor_dns uses a single-byte XOR cipher to\nencrypt its communications, which have been observed using key 0xB9. Once decrypted, the string\n```\n   anchor_dns can be found in the DNS request traffic.\n\n###### TrickBot Indicators of Compromise\n\n```\nAfter successful execution of the malware, TrickBot copies itself as an executable file with a 12character (includes .exe), randomly generated file name (e.g. mfjdieks.exe) and places this file in\none of the following directories.\n\n     - C:\\Windows\\\n\n     - C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\\n\n     - C:\\Users\\[Username]\\AppData\\Roaming\\\n\nOnce the executable is running and successful in establishing communication with C2s, the\nexecutable places appropriate modules downloaded from C2s for the infected processor architecture\ntype (32 or 64 bit instruction set), to the infected host’s %APPDATA% or %PROGRAMDATA% directory, such\nas %AppData\\Roaming\\winapp. Some commonly named plugins that are created in a Modules\nsubdirectory are (the detected architecture is appended to the module filename, e.g., importDll32 or\n```\n   importDll64):\n\n```\n     - `Systeminfo`\n\n     - `importDll`\n\n     - `outlookDll`\n\n     - `injectDll with a directory (ex. injectDLL64_configs) containing configuration files:`\n```\n        o dinj\n        o sinj\n\n```\nPage 3 of 22 | Prod ct ID AA20 302A\n\n\nCISA | FBI | HHS\n\n\n-----\n\nCISA | FBI | HHS\n**TLP:WHITE**\n```\n        o dpost\n\n```\n     - `mailsearcher with a directory (ex. mailsearcher64_configs) containing configuration file:`\n```\n        o mailconf\n\n```\n     - `networkDll with a directory (ex. networkDll64_configs) containing configuration file:`\n```\n        o dpost\n\n```\n     - `wormDll`\n\n     - `tabDll`\n\n     - `shareDll`\n\nFilename client_id or data or FAQ with the assigned bot ID of the compromised system is created\nin the malware directory. Filename group_tag or Readme.md containing the TrickBot campaign IDs is\ncreated in the malware directory.\n\nThe malware may also drop a file named anchorDiag.txt in one of the directories listed above.\n\nPart of the initial network communications with the C2 server involves sending information about the\nvictim machine such as its computer name/hostname, operating system version, and build via a\nbase64-encoded GUID. The GUID is composed of /GroupID/ClientID/ with the following naming\nconvention:\n```\n   /anchor_dns/[COMPUTERNAME]_[WindowsVersionBuildNo].[32CharacterString]/.\n\n```\nThe malware uses scheduled tasks that run every 15 minutes to ensure persistence on the victim\nmachine. The scheduled task typically uses the following naming convention.\n```\n   [random_folder_name_in_%APPDATA%_excluding_Microsoft]\n   autoupdate#[5_random_numbers] (e.g., Task autoupdate#16876).\n\n```\nAfter successful execution, anchor_dns further deploys malicious batch scripts (.bat) using\nPowerShell commands.\n\nThe malware deploys self-deletion techniques by executing the following commands.\n\n     - `cmd.exe /c` `timeout 3 && del C:\\Users\\[username]\\[malware_sample]`\n\n     - `cmd.exe /C PowerShell \\\"Start-Sleep 3; Remove-Item`\n```\n      C:\\Users\\[username]\\[malware_sample_location]\\\"\n\n```\nThe following domains found in outbound DNS records are associated with anchor_dns.\n\n     - `kostunivo[.]com`\n\n     - `chishir[.]com`\n\n     - `mangoclone[.]com`\n\n     - `onixcellent[.]com`\n\nThis malware used the following legitimate domains to test internet connectivity.\n\n     - `ipecho[.]net`\n\n     - `api[.]ipify[.]org`\n\nPage 4 of 22 | Prod ct ID AA20 302A\n\n\nCISA | FBI | HHS\n\n\n-----\n\nCISA | FBI | HHS\n**TLP:WHITE**\n\n     - `checkip[.]amazonaws[.]com`\n\n     - `ip[.]anysrc[.]net`\n\n     - `wtfismyip[.]com`\n\n     - `ipinfo[.]io`\n\n     - `icanhazip[.]com`\n\n     - `myexternalip[.]com`\n\n     - `ident[.]me`\n\nCurrently, there is an open source tracker for Trickbot C2 servers located at\n###### https://feodotracker.abuse.ch/browse/trickbot/.\n\nThe anchor_dns malware historically used the following C2 servers.\n\n     - `23[.]95[.]97[.]59`\n\n     - `51[.]254[.]25[.]115`\n\n     - `193[.]183[.]98[.]66`\n\n     - `91[.]217[.]137[.]37`\n\n     - `87[.]98[.]175[.]85`\n\n###### TrickBot YARA Rules\n\n\nCISA | FBI | HHS\n\n```\nrule anchor_dns_strings_filenames {\n\n```\n```\n  meta:\n\n```\n```\n    description = \"Rule to detect AnchorDNS samples based off strings or\nfilenames used in malware\"\n\n```\n```\n    author = \"NCSC\"\n\n```\n```\n    hash1 = \"fc0efd612ad528795472e99cae5944b68b8e26dc\"\n    hash2 = \"794eb3a9ce8b7e5092bb1b93341a54097f5b78a9\"\n    hash3 = \"9dfce70fded4f3bc2aa50ca772b0f9094b7b1fb2\"\n    hash4 = \"24d4bbc982a6a561f0426a683b9617de1a96a74a\"\n\n```\n```\n  strings:\n\n```\n```\n    $ = \",Control_RunDLL \\x00\"\n\n```\n```\n    $ = \":$GUID\" ascii wide\n    $ = \":$DATA\" ascii wide\n\n```\n```\n    $ = \"/1001/\"\n\n```\n```\n    $ = /(\\x00|\\xCC)qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm(\\x00|\\xCC)/\n    $ = /(\\x00|\\xCC)QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJKLZXCVBNM(\\x00|\\xCC)/\n\n```\nPage 5 of 22 | Prod ct ID AA20 302A\n\n\n-----\n\nCISA | FBI | HHS\n**TLP:WHITE**\n\n\nCISA | FBI | HHS\n\n```\n    $ = \"start program with cmdline \\\"%s\\\"\"\n\n```\n```\n    $ = \"Global\\\\fde345tyhoVGYHUJKIOuy\"\n\n```\n```\n    $ = \"ChardWorker::thExecute: error registry me\"\n\n```\n```\n    $ = \"get command: incode %s, cmdid \\\"%s\\\", cmd \\\"%s\\\"\"\n\n```\n```\n    $ = \"anchorDNS\"\n\n```\n```\n    $ = \"Anchor_x86\"\n    $ = \"Anchor_x64\"\n\n```\n```\n  condition:\n\n```\n```\n    (uint16(0) == 0x5A4D and uint16(uint32(0x3c)) == 0x4550) and 3 of them\n\n```\n```\n}\n\n```\n```\nrule anchor_dns_icmp_transport {\n\n```\n```\n  meta:\n\n```\n```\n    description = \"Rule to detect AnchorDNS samples based off ICMP transport\nstrings\"\n\n```\n```\n    author = \"NCSC\"\n\n```\n```\n    hash1 = \"056f326d9ab960ed02356b34a6dcd72d7180fc83\"\n\n```\n```\n  strings:\n\n```\n```\n    $ = \"reset_connection <- %s\"\n\n```\n```\n    $ = \"server_ok <- %s (packets on server %s)\"\n\n```\n```\n    $ = \"erase successfully transmitted packet (count: %d)\"\n\n```\n```\n    $ = \"Packet sended with crc %s -> %s\"\n\n```\n```\n    $ = \"send data confimation to server(%s)\"\n\n```\n```\n    $ = \"data recived from <- %s\"\n\n```\n```\n    $ = \"Rearmost packed recived (id: %s)\"\n\n```\n```\n    $ = \"send poll to server -> : %s\"\n\n```\n```\n  condition:\n\n```\n```\n    (uint16(0) == 0x5A4D and uint16(uint32(0x3c)) == 0x4550) and 3 of them\n\n```\n```\n}\n\n```\n\nPage 6 of 22 | Prod ct ID AA20 302A\n\n\n-----\n\nCISA | FBI | HHS\n**TLP:WHITE**\n\n\nCISA | FBI | HHS\n\n```\nrule anchor_dns_config_dexor {\n\n```\n```\n  meta:\n\n```\n```\n    description = \"Rule to detect AnchorDNS samples based off configuration\ndeobfuscation (XOR 0x23 countup)\"\n\n```\n```\n    author = \"NCSC\"\n\n```\n```\n    hash1 = \"d0278ec015e10ada000915a1943ddbb3a0b6b3db\"\n    hash2 = \"056f326d9ab960ed02356b34a6dcd72d7180fc83\"\n\n```\n```\n  strings:\n\n```\n```\n    $x86 = {75 1F 56 6A 40 B2 23 33 C9 5E 8A 81 ?? ?? ?? ?? 32 C2 FE C2 88 81\n?? ?? ?? ?? 41 83 EE 01 75 EA 5E B8 ?? ?? ?? ??

The loader and backdoor work closely\ntogether to achieve infection and communicate with the same C2 infrastructure. Campaigns using\nBazar represent a new technique for cybercriminals to infect and monetize networks and have\nincreasingly led to the deployment of ransomware, including Ryuk. BazarLoader has become one of\nthe most commonly used vectors for ransomware deployment.\n\nDeployment of the BazarLoader malware typically comes from phishing email and contains the\nfollowing:\n\n  - Phishing emails are typically delivered by commercial mass email delivery services. Email\nreceived by a victim will contain a link to an actor-controlled Google Drive document or other\nfree online filehosting solutions, typically purporting to be a PDF file.\n\n  - This document usually references a failure to create a preview of the document and contains a\nlink to a URL hosting a malware payload in the form of a misnamed or multiple extension file.\n\n  - Emails can appear as routine, legitimate business correspondence about customer\ncomplaints, hiring decision, or other important tasks that require the attention of the recipient.\n\n  - Some email communications have included the recipient’s name or employer name in the\nsubject line and/or email body.\n\nThrough phishing emails linking users to Google Documents, actors used the below identified file\nnames to install BazarLoader:\n\n  - `Report-Review26-10.exe`\n\n  - `Review_Report15-10.exe`\n\n  - `Document_Print.exe`\n\n  - `Report10-13.exe`\n\n  - `Text_Report.exe`\n\nBazar activity can be identified by searching the system startup folders and Userinit values under the\n```\nHKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon registry key:\n%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\adobe.lnk\n\n```\nPage 11 of 22 | Prod ct ID AA20 302A\n\n\n-----\n\nCISA | FBI | HHS\n**TLP:WHITE**\n\nFor a comprehensive list of indicators of compromise regarding the BazarLocker malware, see\n[https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/10/kegtap-and-singlemalt-with-a-ransomware-](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/10/kegtap-and-singlemalt-with-a-ransomware-chaser.html)\n[chaser.html.](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/10/kegtap-and-singlemalt-with-a-ransomware-chaser.html)\n\n##### Indicators\n\nIn addition to TrickBot and BazarLoader, threat actors are using malware, such as KEGTAP,\nBEERBOT, SINGLEMALT, and others as they continue to change tactics, techniques, and\nprocedures in their highly dynamic campaign.[1] The following C2 servers are known to be associated\nwith this malicious activity.\n\n     - `45[.]148[.]10[.]92`\n\n     - `170[.]238[.]117[.]187`\n\n     - `177[.]74[.]232[.]124`\n\n     - `185[.]68[.]93[.]17`\n\n     - `203[.]176[.]135[.]102`\n\n     - `96[.]9[.]73[.]73`\n\n     - `96[.]9[.]77[.]142`\n\n     - `37[.]187[.]3[.]176`\n\n     - `45[.]89[.]127[.]92`\n\n     - `62[.]108[.]35[.]103`\n\n     - `91[.]200[.]103[.]242`\n\n     - `103[.]84[.]238[.]3`\n\n     - `36[.]89[.]106[.]69`\n\n     - `103[.]76[.]169[.]213`\n\n     - `36[.]91[.]87[.]227`\n\n     - `105[.]163[.]17[.]83`\n\n     - `185[.]117[.]73[.]163`\n\n     - `5[.]2[.]78[.]118`\n\n     - `185[.]90[.]61[.]69`\n\n     - `185[.]90[.]61[.]62`\n\n     - `86[.]104[.]194[.]30`\n\n     - `31[.]131[.]21[.]184`\n\n     - `46[.]28[.]64[.]8`\n\n     - `104[.]161[.]32[.]111`\n\n     - `107[.]172[.]140[.]171`\n\n     - `131[.]153[.]22[.]148`\n\n     - `195[.]123[.]240[.]219`\n\n     - `195[.]123[.]242[.]119`\n\n1 FireEye: [Unhappy Hour Special: KEGTAP and SINGLEMALT With a Ransomware Chaser](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/10/kegtap-and-singlemalt-with-a-ransomware-chaser.html?&web_view=true)\n\nPage 12 of 22 | Prod ct ID AA20 302A\n\n\nCISA | FBI | HHS\n\n\n-----\n\nCISA | FBI | HHS\n**TLP:WHITE**\n\n     - `195[.]123[.]242[.]120`\n\n     - `51[.]81[.]113[.]25`\n\n     - `74[.]222[.]14[.]27`\n\n#### Ryuk Ransomware\n\nTypically Ryuk has been deployed as a payload from banking Trojans such as TrickBot.[2] Ryuk first\nappeared in August 2018 as a derivative of Hermes 2.1 ransomware, which first emerged in late 2017\nand was available for sale on the open market as of August 2018. Ryuk still retains some aspects of\nthe Hermes code. For example, all of the files encrypted by Ryuk contain the HERMES tag but, in some\ninfections, the files have .ryk added to the filename, while others do not. In other parts of the\nransomware code, Ryuk has removed or replaced features of Hermes, such as the restriction against\ntargeting specific Eurasia-based systems.\n\nWhile negotiating the victim network, Ryuk actors will commonly use commercial off-the-shelf\nproducts—such as Cobalt Strike and PowerShell Empire—in order to steal credentials. Both\nframeworks are very robust and are highly effective dual-purpose tools, allowing actors to dump clear\ntext passwords or hash values from memory with the use of Mimikatz. This allows the actors to inject\nmalicious dynamic-link library into memory with read, write, and execute permissions. In order to\nmaintain persistence in the victim environment, Ryuk actors have been known to use scheduled tasks\nand service creation.\n\nRyuk actors will quickly map the network in order to enumerate the environment to understand the\nscope of the infection. In order to limit suspicious activity and possible detection, the actors choose to\nlive off the land and, if possible, use native tools—such as net view, net computers, and ping—to\nlocate mapped network shares, domain controllers, and active directory. In order to move laterally\nthroughout the network, the group relies on native tools, such as PowerShell, Windows Management\nInstrumentation (WMI), Windows Remote Management, and Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). The\ngroup also uses third-party tools, such as Bloodhound.\n\nOnce dropped, Ryuk uses AES-256 to encrypt files and an RSA public key to encrypt the AES key.\nThe Ryuk dropper drops a .bat file that attempts to delete all backup files and Volume Shadow\nCopies (automatic backup snapshots made by Windows), preventing the victim from recovering\nencrypted files without the decryption program.\n\nIn addition, the attackers will attempt to shut down or uninstall security applications on the victim\nsystems that might prevent the ransomware from executing. Normally this is done via a script, but if\nthat fails, the attackers are capable of manually removing the applications that could stop the attack.\nThe RyukReadMe file placed on the system after encryption provides either one or two email\n\n2 See the United Kingdom (UK) National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) advisory, [Ryuk Ransomware Targeting](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/ryuk-advisory)\n[Organisations Globally, on their ongoing investigation into global Ryuk ransomware campaigns and associated](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/ryuk-advisory)\nEmotet and TrickBot malware.\n\nPage 13 of 22 | Prod ct ID AA20 302A\n\n\nCISA | FBI | HHS\n\n\n-----\n\nCISA | FBI | HHS\n**TLP:WHITE**\n\naddresses, using the end-to-end encrypted email provider Protonmail, through which the victim can\ncontact the attacker(s). While earlier versions provide a ransom amount in the initial notifications,\nRyuk users are now designating a ransom amount only after the victim makes contact.\n\nThe victim is told how much to pay to a specified Bitcoin wallet for the decryptor and is provided a\nsample decryption of two files.\n\nInitial testing indicates that the RyukReadMe file does not need to be present for the decryption script\nto run successfully but other reporting advises some files will not decrypt properly without it. Even if\nrun correctly, there is no guarantee the decryptor will be effective. This is further complicated because\nthe RyukReadMe file is deleted when the script is finished. This may affect the decryption script unless\nit is saved and stored in a different location before running.\n\n[According to MITRE, Ryuk](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/software/S0446/) uses the ATT&CK techniques listed in table 1.\n\n_Table 1: Ryuk ATT&CK techniques_\n\n**Technique** **Use**\n\n_[System Network Configuration](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1016)_ Ryuk has called `GetIpNetTable` in attempt to identify all\n_[Discovery [T1016]](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1016)_ mounted drives and hosts that have Address Resolution\n\nProtocol entries.\n\n_[Masquerading:](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1036)_ _[Match Legitimate](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1036/005)_ Ryuk has constructed legitimate appearing installation folder\n_[Name or Location [T1036.005]](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1036/005)_ paths by calling `GetWindowsDirectoryW` and then inserting a\n\nnull byte at the fourth character of the path.

Evaluating continuity and capability will help\nidentify continuity gaps. Through identifying and addressing these gaps, organizations can establish a\nviable continuity program that will help keep them functioning during cyberattacks or other\nemergencies. CISA, FBI, and HHS suggest HPH Sector organizations review or establish patching\nplans, security policies, user agreements, and business continuity plans to ensure they address\ncurrent threats posed by malicious cyber actors.\n\n#### Network Best Practices \n\n     - Patch operating systems, software, and firmware as soon as manufacturers release updates.\n\n     - Check configurations for every operating system version for HPH organization-owned assets\nto prevent issues from arising that local users are unable to fix due to having local\nadministration disabled.\n\n     - Regularly change passwords to network systems and accounts and avoid reusing passwords\nfor different accounts.\n\n     - Use multi-factor authentication where possible.\n\n     - Disable unused remote access/Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) ports and monitor remote\naccess/RDP logs.\n\n     - Implement application and remote access allow listing to only allow systems to execute\nprograms known and permitted by the established security policy.\n\n     - Audit user accounts with administrative privileges and configure access controls with least\nprivilege in mind.\n\n     - Audit logs to ensure new accounts are legitimate.\n\n     - Scan for open or listening ports and mediate those that are not needed.\n\n     - Identify critical assets such as patient database servers, medical records, and teleheatlh and\ntelework infrastructure; create backups of these systems and house the backups offline from\nthe network.\n\n     - Implement network segmentation. Sensitive data should not reside on the same server and\nnetwork segment as the email environment.\n\n     - Set antivirus and anti-malware solutions to automatically update; conduct regular scans.\n\n#### Ransomware Best Practices\n\nCISA, FBI and HHS do not recommend paying ransoms. Payment does not guarantee files will be\nrecovered. It may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other\ncriminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities. In addition to\nimplementing the above network best practices, the FBI, CISA and HHS also recommend the\nfollowing:\n\n     - Regularly back up data, air gap, and password protect backup copies offline.\n\n     - Implement a recovery plan to maintain and retain multiple copies of sensitive or proprietary\ndata and servers in a physically separate, secure location.\n\n#### User Awareness Best Practices\n\nPage 16 of 22 | Prod ct ID AA20 302A\n\n\nCISA | FBI | HHS\n\n\n-----\n\nCISA | FBI | HHS\n**TLP:WHITE**\n\n     - Focus on awareness and training. Because end users are targeted, make employees and\nstakeholders aware of the threats—such as ransomware and phishing scams—and how they\nare delivered. Additionally, provide users training on information security principles and\ntechniques as well as overall emerging cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities.\n\n     - Ensure that employees know who to contact when they see suspicious activity or when they\nbelieve they have been a victim of a cyberattack. This will ensure that the proper established\nmitigation strategy can be employed quickly and efficiently.\n\n#### Recommended Mitigation Measures\n\nSystem administrators who have indicators of a TrickBot network compromise should immediately\ntake steps to back up and secure sensitive or proprietary data. TrickBot infections may be indicators\nof an imminent ransomware attack; system administrators should take steps to secure network\ndevices accordingly. Upon evidence of a TrickBot infection, review DNS logs and use the XOR key of\n```\n   0xB9 to decode XOR encoded DNS requests to reveal the presence of anchor_dns, and maintain and\n\n```\nprovide relevant logs.\n\n### GENERAL RANSOMWARE MITIGATIONS — HPH SECTOR\n\n_This section is based on CISA and Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC)'s_\n_[Joint Ransomware Guide, which can be found at https://www.cisa.gov/publication/ransomware-guide.](https://www.cisa.gov/publication/ransomware-guide)_\n\nCISA, FBI, and HHS recommend that healthcare organizations implement both ransomware\nprevention and ransomware response meaures immediately.\n\n#### Ransomware Prevention\n\n##### Join and Engage with Cybersecurity Organizations\n\nCISA, FBI, and HHS recommend that healthcare organizations take the following initial steps:\n\n     - Join a healthcare information sharing organization, H-ISAC:\n```\n        o Health Information Sharing and Analysis Center (H-ISAC): https://h\n```\n[isac.org/membership-account/join-h-isac/](https://h-isac.org/membership-account/join-h-isac/)\n```\n        o Sector-based ISACs - National Council of ISACs:\n\n```\n[https://www.nationalisacs.org/member-isacs](https://www.nationalisacs.org/member-isacs)\n```\n        o Information Sharing and Analysis Organization (ISAO) Standards Organization:\n\n```\n[https://www.isao.org/information-sharing-groups/](https://www.isao.org/information-sharing-groups/)\n\n     - Engage with CISA and FBI, as well as HHS—through the HHS Health Sector Cybersecurity\nCoordination Center (HC3)—to build a lasting partnership and collaborate on information\nsharing, best practices, assessments, and exercises.\n\n`o CISA: cisa.gov,` [https://us-cert.cisa.gov/mailing-lists-and-feeds,](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/mailing-lists-and-feeds) [central@cisa.gov](mailto:central@cisa.gov)\n`o FBI: ic3.gov,` [www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field,](http://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field) [CyWatch@fbi.gov](mailto:CyWatch@fbi.gov)\n`o HHS/HC3: http://www.hhs.gov/hc3,` HC3@HHS.gov\n\nPage 17 of 22 | Prod ct ID AA20 302A\n\n\nCISA | FBI | HHS\n\n\n-----\n\nCISA | FBI | HHS\n**TLP:WHITE**\n\nEngaging with the H-ISAC, ISAO, CISA, FBI, and HHS/HC3 will enable your organization to receive\ncritical information and access to services to better manage the risk posed by ransomware and other\ncyber threats.\n\n##### Follow Ransomware Best Practices\n\nRefer to the best practices and references below to help manage the risk posed by ransomware and\nsupport your organization’s coordinated and efficient response to a ransomware incident. Apply these\npractices to the greatest extent possible based on availability of organizational resources.\n\n     - It is critical to maintain offline, encrypted backups of data and to regularly test your backups.\nBackup procedures should be conducted on a regular basis. It is important that backups be\nmaintained offline or in separated networks as many ransomware variants attempt to find and\ndelete any accessible backups. Maintaining offline, current backups is most critical because\nthere is no need to pay a ransom for data that is readily accessible to your organization.\n```\n        o Use the 3-2-1 rule as a guideline for backup practices. The rule states that three\n\n```\ncopies of all critical data are retained on at least two different types of media and at\nleast one of them is stored offline.\n```\n        o Maintain regularly updated “gold images” of critical systems in the event they need to\n\n```\nbe rebuilt. This entails maintaining image “templates” that include a preconfigured\noperating system (OS) and associated software applications that can be quickly\ndeployed to rebuild a system, such as a virtual machine or server.\n```\n        o Retain backup hardware to rebuild systems in the event rebuilding the primary system\n\n```\nis not preferred.\n\n          - Hardware that is newer or older than the primary system can present installation or\ncompatibility hurdles when rebuilding from images.\n\n          - Ensure all backup hardware is properly patched.\n\n     - In addition to system images, applicable source code or executables should be available\n(stored with backups, escrowed, license agreement to obtain, etc.). It is more efficient to\nrebuild from system images, but some images will not install on different hardware or\nplatforms correctly; having separate access to needed software will help in these cases.\n\n     - Create, maintain, and exercise a basic cyber incident response plan and associated\ncommunications plan that includes response and notification procedures for a ransomware\nincident.\n```\n        o Review available incident response guidance, such as CISA’s Technical Approaches\n\n```\nto Uncovering and Remediating Malicious Activity https://us[cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-245a.](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-245a)\n\n     - Help your organization better organize around cyber incident response.\n\n     - Develop a cyber incident response plan.\n\n     - [The Ransomware Response Checklist, available in the CISA and MS-ISAC Joint](https://www.cisa.gov/publication/ransomware-guide)\n[Ransomware Guide, serves as an adaptable, ransomware- specific annex to organizational](https://www.cisa.gov/publication/ransomware-guide)\ncyber incident response or disruption plans.\n\nPage 18 of 22 | Prod ct ID AA20 302A\n\n\nCISA | FBI | HHS\n\n\n-----\n\nCISA | FBI | HHS\n**TLP:WHITE**\n\n     - Review and implement as applicable MITRE’s Medical Device Cybersecurity: Regional\nIncident Preparedness and Response Playbook\n[(https://www.mitre.org/sites/default/files/publications/pr-18-1550-Medical-Device-](https://www.mitre.org/sites/default/files/publications/pr-18-1550-Medical-Device-Cybersecurity-Playbook.pdf)\n[Cybersecurity-Playbook.pdf).](https://www.mitre.org/sites/default/files/publications/pr-18-1550-Medical-Device-Cybersecurity-Playbook.pdf)\n\n     - Develop a risk management plan that maps critical health services and care to the necessary\ninformation systems; this will ensure that the incident response plan will contain the proper\ntriage procedures.\n\n     - Plan for the possibility of critical information systems being inaccessible for an extended\nperiod of time. This should include but not be limited to the following:\n```\n        o Print and properly store/protect hard copies of digital information that would be\n\n```\nrequired for critical patient healthcare.\n```\n        o Plan for and periodically train staff to handle the re-routing of incoming/existing\n\n```\npatients in an expedient manner if information systems were to abruptly and\nunexpectedly become unavailable.\n```\n        o Coordinate the potential for surge support with other healthcare facilities in the greater\n\n```\nlocal area. This should include organizational leadership periodically meeting and\ncollaborating with counterparts in the greater local area to create/update plans for their\nfacilities to both abruptly send and receive a significant amount of critical patients for\nimmediate care. This may include the opportunity to re-route healthcare employees\n(and possibly some equipment) to provide care along with additional patients.\n\n     - Consider the development of a second, air-gapped communications network that can provide\na minimum standard of backup support for hospital operations if the primary network becomes\nunavailable if/when needed.\n\n     - Predefine network segments, IT capabilities and other functionality that can either be quickly\nseparated from the greater network or shut down entirely without impacting operations of the\nrest of the IT infrastructure.\n\n     - Legacy devices should be identified and inventoried with highest priority and given special\nconsideration during a ransomware event.\n\n     - [See CISA and MS-ISAC's Joint Ransomware Guide](https://www.cisa.gov/publication/ransomware-guide) for infection vectors including internetfacing vulnerabilities and misconfigurations;
