    "plain_text": "# Big Game Hunting on the Rise Again According to eCrime Index\n\n**[crowdstrike.com/blog/big-game-hunting-on-the-rise-again-according-to-ecrime-index/](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/big-game-hunting-on-the-rise-again-according-to-ecrime-index/)**\n\nCrowdStrike Intelligence Team October 12, 2021\n\n**_This announcement is part of the Fal.Con 2021 CrowdStrike Cybersecurity_**\n**_Conference, Oct. 12-14._** **_[Register now for free to learn all about our exciting new](https://www.crowdstrike.com/falcon/)_**\n**_products, partnerships and latest intel!_**\n\nThe eCrime ecosystem is an active and diverse economy of financially motivated threat\nactors engaging in a myriad of criminal activities to generate revenue. CrowdStrike\n[Intelligence maintains the CrowdStrike eCrime Index (ECX) to provide a composite score for](https://adversary.crowdstrike.com/)\ntracking changes to this ecosystem. The ECX is composed of several key observables\ncovering different aspects of criminal activity that are combined using a mathematical model.\n\nSince a CARBON SPIDER _[DarkSide affiliate infected Colonial Pipeline in May 2021,](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/how-big-game-hunting-ttps-shifted-after-darkside-pipeline-attack/)_\n[CrowdStrike Intelligence observed big game hunting (BGH) adversaries slow or cease their](https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/cyber-big-game-hunting/)\nactivity and change their tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs), resulting in a downward\ntrend in the ECX. However, in recent weeks, the ECX has mirrored a resurgence in BGH\nransomware data leaks and demonstrated an uptick in activity.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Surge in Data Leaks\n\nIn the week prior to the Colonial Pipeline incident, BGH ransomware incidents that resulted\nin data leaks had reached an all-time high of 92. Following the incident, many ransomware\nfamilies significantly reduced their operational tempo or ceased operations, likely in an\nattempt to avoid the increased scrutiny that ransomware campaigns attracted. Figure 1\n[illustrates the ransomware data leak activity observed since the CARBON SPIDER affiliate](https://adversary.crowdstrike.com/en-US/adversary/carbon-spider/)\nColonial Pipeline infection (highlighted in white).\n\nFigure 1. Number of BGH ransomware data leaks by week since the Colonial Pipeline incident\n\nThe reduction of incidents following the week beginning May 3, 2021, is likely attributed to a\ncombination of factors:\n\nIncreased scrutiny of ransomware threat actors\nBanning of forum activity related to ransomware operations\n[The reported retirement of adversaries, such as CIRCUS SPIDER (Netwalker) and](https://falcon.crowdstrike.com/intelligence/actors/circus-spider)\n[RIDDLE SPIDER (Avaddon)](https://falcon.crowdstrike.com/intelligence/actors/riddle-spider)\n[The disappearance of prolific threat actors, such as PINCHY SPIDER (REvil)](https://adversary.crowdstrike.com/en-US/adversary/pinchy-spider/)\nDisruption within certain groups, such as the operators of Babuk Locker, who have split\ninto multiple groups and diversified their respective offerings\n\n\n-----\n\nHowever, in the past few weeks, CrowdStrike Intelligence has observed ransomware data\nleak incidents reach 90 — representing the highest peak since the dip. This surge in data\nleaks is very likely due to the return of PINCHY SPIDER’s REvil ransomware as a service\n(RaaS), the increase in CARBON SPIDER’s BlackMatter RaaS activity, and the prolific\noperational tempo of LockBit RaaS, which is responsible for 220 data leaks since it returned\nin July 2021; the LockBit data leaks account for more than 36% of the leaks since their huge\nresurgence.\n\nCrowdStrike Intelligence has also observed forum activity from or associated with BGH\nactors continuing, despite restrictions put in place by admins in July 2021. Some notable\ntopics observed include:\n\nRaaS projects and other posts related to ransomware partnerships continue to be\nposted and advertised in forums.\nGroups such as LockBit have recently advertised they were looking for penetration\ntesters for “red team operations” in a style of language designed to mirror that found in\nlegitimate cybersecurity job postings.\nSeparately, other actors have resorted to advertising ransomware partnerships on\nRAMP — a forum purportedly established by Babuk Locker operators specifically for\nransomware-related chatter.\n\n## ECX Reflections\n\nWhile the ECX models a wide range of data points within the eCrime marketplace, it is clear\nthat a recent surge in data leaks is reflected in the ECX. Also having a significant impact on\nthe ECX is the number of high ransom demands. For example, PINCHY SPIDER REvil\naffiliates have been observed issuing a ransom demand of $80 million USD, and CARBON\nSPIDER’s BlackMatter affiliates have been observed demanding as much as $60 million\nUSD in the past weeks. The combination of these factors has resulted in a significant\nincrease in the ECX (Figure 2).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2. ECX values by week since the Colonial Pipeline incident\n\n## Outlook\n\nAttempts by the Biden administration to put political pressure on the Russian government to\nassist in clamping down on BGH actors do not appear to have borne fruit. Although some\ngroups have stated they will avoid targeting certain sectors, these pledges have proven to be\nrather limited.\n\nDespite increased law enforcement attention following a REvil attack on the U.S.-based food\nprocessing company JBS in May 2021, some BGH actors remain willing to continue targeting\nmajor and possibly critical companies. For example, on Sept. 18, 2021, a BlackMatter\noperator attempted to ransom a North American agricultural cooperative for more than $11\nmillion USD despite this business being clearly identified as critical infrastructure by the U.S.\nDepartment of Homeland Security.\n\nThe CrowdStrike Intelligence ECX is mathematically calculated using multiple tracked\nobservables. Over the past few weeks, the increase of ransomware data leaks — and a\nconsistent number of high ransom demands — has resulted in a substantial upward trend,\nwhich is likely to continue in the short term. This assessment is made with moderate\nconfidence based on the continuation of BGH actors restoring to their prior operational\ntempo, as well as new and existing ransomware operators emerging and maturing.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe ECX remains a valuable tool used to identify significant events affecting the eCrime\necosystem. The ECX provides an easily referenced index to mark areas of disruption or\nchange in the eCrime ecosystem in real time.\n\n[Monitor the ECX regularly in the CrowdStrike Adversary Universe to make sure you stay up-](https://adversary.crowdstrike.com/)\nto-date on eCrime trends.\n\n**Additional Resources**\n\n_[Learn how Falcon X Recon™ mitigates digital risk from the deep, dark web and](https://www.crowdstrike.com/products/threat-intelligence/falcon-x-recon/)_\n_beyond._\n_Read about BGH adversaries tracked by CrowdStrike Intelligence in 2020 in the_\n_[CrowdStrike 2021 Global Threat Report.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/resources/reports/global-threat-report/)_\n_To find out how to incorporate intelligence on threat actors into your security strategy,_\n_visit the_ _[Falcon X™ Threat Intelligence page.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/endpoint-security-products/falcon-x-threat-intelligence/)_\n_Learn about the powerful, cloud-native CrowdStrike Falcon® platform by visiting the_\n_product webpage._\n_[Get a full-featured free trial of CrowdStrike Falcon Prevent™ and learn how true next-](https://go.crowdstrike.com/try-falcon-prevent.html)_\n_gen AV performs against today’s most sophisticated threats._\n\n\n-----",
