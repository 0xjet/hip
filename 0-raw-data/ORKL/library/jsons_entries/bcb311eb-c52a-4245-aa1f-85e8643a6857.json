Introduction to Passive backdoors\n\nPassive backdoors are implants designed to be stealthier than common backdoors, especially by\navoiding listening on ports or pinging back to a Command and Control server.\n\nThese backdoors are not novel, one of the first sample being `cd00r from` _phenoelit, a passive_\nbackdoor waiting for a TCP port knocking sequence, dating back to 2000 [1].\n\nPassive backdoors are also used by some of the most advanced attackers, such as Duqu2 with their\n```\nportserv.sys driver, the famous Equation Group with their Bvp47 or DewDrop implant [2, 3], or the\n\n```\n_Turla threat group with their Uroburos rootkit that we previously analyzed [11]._\n\nThis kind of backdoor has several advantages:\n\n  - They cannot be detected by tools such as netstat because they don’t open network ports\n\n  - They can be activated by piggybacking on already opened ports (for example, a packet sent\nto a legitimate HTTP listening port will trigger the backdoor)\n\n  - They are inactive unless activated by the attacker.\n\nWhile not as complex as `Bvp47, this backdoor provided the attackers with simple yet powerful`\ncapabilities, such as a remote access to the infected systems.\n\n## II. Capabilities\n\nThis backdoor family uses a BPF filter in order to await a trigger packet, and depending on the\nreceived command will either send a ping back, launch a bind shell, or connect a remote shell to the\nattacker provided IP address.\n\nThe implant expects to be launched as the privileged root user, and uses a lock in order to avoid\nbeing launched several times. The attacker took special attention to make the lock’s filename\nappears legitimate, and used several of these filenames across the samples. Some of them can be\nfound in the IOCs Annex of this article.\n\n## III. Persistence\n\nThe binary does not implement any kind of persistence. We assume that the attacker will provide the\npersistence by modifying configuration files on the targeted system during installation.\n\n## IV. Protection techniques\n\nThe malware uses several techniques in order to avoid detection, these techniques varying between\nsamples. Some of them relaunched from memory, in order to avoid traces on the file system, while\nothers modified their access and modification timestamp.\n\n\nThe binary does not implement any kind of persistence.

Some of them relaunched from memory, in order to avoid traces on the file system, while\n\n\n-----\n\n## V. In memory launch\n\nSome of the samples copied themselves in the `/dev/shm folder with a custom filename, before`\nrelaunching the copied sample. This technique avoid leaving traces on the target file system, and\nensures the binary is completely removed on reboot.\n\n## VI. Process renaming\n\nThe malware will rename itself using the `prctl function with the argument` `PR_SET_NAME, and a`\nrandom legitimate-looking name.\n\nThese names are hardcoded in the binary, and vary between the samples.\n\nA partial list of used process names can be found in annex of this article.\n\n## VII. Timestomping\n\nIn some of the samples, a function dubbed set_time was called to alter the access and modification\ntimestamp of the binary using the `utimes function. The timestamp used was always set to`\n```\n0x490a083c (2008-10-30T20:17:16).\n\n## VIII. Command and Control\n\n```\nThe command and control mechanism of this backdoor is relatively simple, it waits for a trigger\npacket, then depending on the command, will establish a bind shell, a reverse shell, or send a reply to\nthe attacker.\n\n## IX. BPF filter analysis\n\n_Berkeley Packet Filter, or BPF, is a technology dating back to the early 90s which was initially designed_\nto filter network packets.\n\nThis filtering subsystem is documented in the Linux kernel [5, 6], and is used under the hood by tools\nsuch as tcpdump.\n\nThis technology was also used by implants such as dewdrop from the Equation toolset [3].\n\nBPF packet filters are implemented using a custom bytecode consisting of about two dozen opcodes,\nall following the same pattern: {opcode, jt, jf, k}.\n\nOnce compiled, such a filter can be instantiated using either `libpcap (pcap_setfilter), or the`\nstandard library function setsockopt using the SO_ATTACH_FILTER option.\n\nIn the case of this backdoor, the latter was chosen, and the BPF bytecode is included in binary form\nin the sample.\n\nThe pseudo-code of the filter installation and packet parsing loop look like this:\n\n```\n      dewdrop from the Equation toolset [3].\n\n```\nBPF packet filters are implemented using a custom bytecode consisting of about two dozen opcodes,\n```\n{opcode, jt, jf, k}.\n              libpcap (pcap_setfilter), or the\n\n```\nusing the SO_ATTACH_FILTER option.\n\nIn the case of this backdoor, the latter was chosen, and the BPF bytecode is included in binary form\n\nThe pseudo-code of the filter installation and packet parsing loop look like this:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nsock_fprog fprog;\n [...]\n // Simplified copy loop\n memcpy(&stored_data, &filter_bytecode, 0x1e * 8);\n [...] \n fprog.len = 0x1e;\n fprog.filter = &stored_data;\n // Create a raw socket\n hSocket = socket(AF_PACKET,SOCK_RAW,(uint)uVar1);\n if ((hSocket < 1) || (iVar2 = setsockopt(hSocket, 1, SO_ATTACH_FILTER, &fprog,\nsizeof(sock_fprog)), iVar2 == -1)) {\n  return;\n }\n while( true ) {\n  do {\n   do {\n    memset(received_buffer,0,0x200);\n    recvfrom(dwCMD,received_buffer,0x200,0,(sockaddr *)0x0,(socklen_t *)0x0);\n    // Now, parse the packet\n [...]\n\n```\nWe chose to dump it from the sample, and developed a BPF processor for Ghidra [7] to disassemble\nit. This processor will be released shortly after some more testing :)\n\nThe disassembled graph is the following:\n\n\n-----\n\n2) Triage between UDP / TCP or ICMP traffic\n3) Get the first 2 bytes of packet data\n4) Check if these 2 bytes looks like a trigger packet (0x5293 for TCP, 0x7255 for UDP and ICMP)\n5) Return the packet if true\n\nWhile searching for similar samples, we also found a Solaris variant of this malware. This variant did\nnot use the setsockopt function, but instead relied on libpcap to install its filter. This time the filter\ncould be found in text form, which confirmed our analysis of the BPF byte code:\n\n```\n(udp[8:2]=0x7255) or (icmp[8:2]=0x7255) or (tcp[((tcp[12]&0xf0)>>2):2]=0x5293)\n\n```\n\nWe can deduce from this that the backdoor can be triggered by three different means:\n1) An UDP packet starting with the bytes 0x7255\n2) An ICMP packet also starting with the bytes 0x7255\nA TCP packet starting with the bytes 0x5293.\n\n## X. Passwords / commands\n\nIf a packet is matched by the filter, it is returned to the malware process in order to be parsed. The\nexpected format is the following:\n```\n               +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+\n               | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |\n               +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+\n               | MAGIC |PADDING|PING IP ADDRESS|\n               +-------+-------+---------------+\n               | PORT | PASSWORD (OR COMMAND) |\n               +-------+-----------------------+\n               | PASSWORD (continued)     |\n               +-------------------------------+\n\n```\nThe processing function will extract the command string from the packet, and compare it to a set of\nhardcoded names, such as\n\n- `justtryit,` `justrobot,` `justforfun, which will establish a bind shell on ports 42391 to`\n42491;\n\n- `socket or sockettcp for establishing a reverse shell to an IP address provided in the packet.`\nBy default, the implant will send the character 1 (encoded as 0x31) to the IP address provided in the\npacket.\n\nBoth the bind shell and the reverse shell processes are renamed (often as\n```\n/usr/libexec/postfix/master). The attacker is also provided with a clean environment, the\n\n```\nfollowing environment variables being set:\n\n- `PROMPT`\n\n- `HISTFILE=/dev/null (this avoids leaving traces in Bash history files)`\n\n- `MYSQL_HISTFILE=/dev/null`\n\n- `PS1=[\\u@\\h \\W]\\\\$`\n\n- `HOME=/tmp or HOME=/`\n\n\nfor establishing a reverse shell to an IP address provided in the packet.\n```\n     1 (encoded as 0x31) to the IP address provided in the\n\n```\nreverse shell processes are renamed (often as\n\n). The attacker is also provided with a clean environment, the\n\n(this avoids leaving traces in Bash history files)\n\n\n-----\n\nIt should be noted that some of the latest variants of the malware are no longer using keywords such\nas socket for triggering its capabilities, but are using MD5 hashes. It may imply that the attacker has\nimproved their implant in order to be more resilient or secure.\n\nThe whole behavior of the implant can be summarized in the following schema:\n\n_Implant behavior_\n\n## XI. Encryption\n\nIf the malware launches the bind shell or the reverse shell, it will encrypt its traffic using the `RC4`\nalgorithm. The key used is simply the received command as seen in the previous part (such as socket\nor justforfun).\n\n## XII. Aside note: a backdoor’s bug\n\nThere is a slight bug in the malware developer code, which will trigger only if the backdoor is\nlaunched when the server is receiving a lot of traffic.\n\nThis bug was documented in [8], and is due to the fact that the socket can receive traffic before the\nBPF filter is applied.\n\n\n-----\n\n## XIII. Conclusion\n\nThe idea behind this backdoor was neither new nor complicated. However, it provided the attacker\nwith critical capabilities against the targeted networks. It also allowed them to remain stealthy for a\nlong time.\n\nThe attacker was regularly updating its toolset with new keywords, improving a little bit its implant\nwith each release by changing their command names, their process names, or their filenames in\norder to avoid trivial detection.\n\n## XIV. Other publications\n\nWhile finishing this article and a set of slides presented at an event in early May, we noticed an\nunusual number of rescans of this malware family. This was due to the fact that security researcher\n_@GossiTheDog tweeted a corresponding hash [9]._\n\nThis malware family seems to be tracked by PwC as BPFDoor used by the Red Menshen threat actor,\nand we look forward to their presentation at Troopers 2022 [10]!\n\n## XV.
