The facts set forth in this affidavit are based upon\n\nmy personal observations, my training and experience, and\n\ninformation obtained from various law enforcement personnel and\n\nwitnesses. This affidavit is intended to show merely that there\n\nis sufficient probable cause for the requested warrant and does\n\nnot purport to set forth all of my knowledge of or investigation\n\ninto this matter.\n\n\n-----\n\n4.\n\n\n**II.** **BACKGROUND OF AFFIANT**\n\n**III.** **STATEMENT OF PROBABLE CAUSE**\n\n\n**A.** **Introduction**\n\n5. The FBI is investigating the Qakbot malicious software\n\n(“malware”) and its associated botnet.[1] The Qakbot malware is\n\ncontrolled by a cybercriminal organization, and its operators\n\nuse Qakbot to target critical industries worldwide. The malware\n\nis primarily spread to victims through spam email messages that\n\ncontain malicious attachments or hyperlinks. After the initial\n\ninfection, the victim computer is effectively controlled by the\n\nQakbot administrators, and the Qakbot malware can deliver both\n\n1 A botnet is a network of computers (each a “bot”) that\nhave been infected with malicious software (here, Qakbot) and\nare being controlled as a group without the owners’ knowledge,\nfor example, to send spam messages to other potential victims.\nQakbot is known by various other names, including Qbot and\nPinkslipbot.\n\n\n-----\n\ncommands and further malware to the computer. As of June 2023,\n\nthere were approximately 200,000 active Qakbot victim computers\n\nlocated in the United States and approximately 700,000 victim\n\ncomputers worldwide.[2]\n\n6. As described below, the FBI has gained access to much\n\nof the Qakbot infrastructure, including computers used by\n\nadministrators of the botnet (the “Qakbot Admin Computers”), and\n\nthrough that access developed a thorough understanding of the\n\noperation of the Qakbot botnet. The FBI has developed a\n\nsoftware file that will be downloaded by victim computers\n\nthroughout the world, including the active victim computers\n\nlocated in the United States. The file will provide the victim\n\ncomputers with new instructions that will untether them from the\n\nQakbot botnet and prevent the Qakbot administrators from further\n\ncommunicating with the infected computers. The process of\n\ndelivering the file to the victim computers will also provide\n\nthe FBI the ability to gather evidence about the malware\n\ninfection, and to collect IP address and routing information\n\nsufficient to identify the victim computer and provide\n\nnotification to the user of the computer about the remote search\n\nauthorized by the proposed warrant.\n\n2 The FBI has identified the IP addresses of many putative\nvictim computers. An IP address is a numerical address used to\nroute traffic on the internet. A single IP address can manage\ninternet traffic for more than one computer or device, such as\nwhen a router in one’s home routes traffic to one’s desktop\ncomputer, as well as one’s tablet or smartphone, while all using\nthe same IP address to access the internet. Based on publicly\navailable records and IP address geolocation, the FBI can\ndetermine the geographic region where devices using a specific\nIP address are likely to be located.\n\n\n-----\n\n**B.** **The Qakbot Malware and Botnet**\n\n7. Qakbot’s operators and administrators offer other\n\ncybercriminal groups access to the botnet for a fee, an\n\narrangement that I know from my experience is common among cyber\n\ncriminals. From this and other FBI investigations, I know that\n\nQakbot has been used as an initial means of infection by many\n\nprolific ransomware groups in recent years, including, but not\n\nlimited to, Conti, ProLock, Egregor, REvil, MegaCortex, and\n\nBlack Basta. Ransomware groups typically gain access to a\n\nvictim computer or computer network, steal victim data, and then\n\nencrypt the victim computers making them unusable. The\n\nransomware actors then extort the victims, seeking payment to\n\n(1) return access to the victim computers; and/or (2) stop the\n\nrelease of the victim’s stolen data on the internet. These\n\npayments are typically demanded in cryptocurrency.\n\n8. The FBI has identified hundreds of victims worldwide\n\nwho have suffered harm due to Qakbot-delivered malware and\n\nassesses that those losses measure in the tens of millions of\n\ndollars. For example, between October 2021 and April 2023,\n\nrecords found on a Qakbot Admin Computer show the payment of\n\nfees to Qakbot administrators corresponding to ransoms paid by\n\nvictims totaling approximately $58 million. Qakbot infections\n\nhave led to harm to victims worldwide, including in the Central\n\nDistrict of California. Below are two examples:\n\na. In June 2021, a company (“Victim A”) located in\n\nwas the victim of a Conti\n\nransomware attack. The FBI’s investigation into the incident\n\n\n-----\n\nshowed that at least one computer on Victim A’s network was\n\ncompromised with Qakbot malware and data was transferred from\n\nthe victim’s network. In August 2021, Victim A arranged,\n\nthrough a third party, to pay a ransom of approximately $100,000\n\nin Bitcoin, a type of cryptocurrency. Information from the\n\nQakbot Admin Computers shows that in September 2021, a Qakbot\n\nadministrator provided a Bitcoin address for payment in\n\nconnection with the ransoming of Victim A. Approximately\n\n$48,000 in Bitcoin was deposited to that Bitcoin address on the\n\nsame day. The funds were subsequently moved to a cryptocurrency\n\nwallet known to the FBI to be controlled by the Qakbot\n\nadministrators.\n\nb. In February 2023, a company (“Victim B”) located\n\nin was the victim of a Black\n\nBasta ransomware attack. The FBI’s investigation into that\n\nincident showed that a computer on Victim B’s network was\n\ninfected with Qakbot in February 2023. Victim B reported losses\n\nrelated to the ransomware incident of more than $10 million.\n\nVictim B paid a ransom of approximately $3 million in Bitcoin to\n\nregain access to their encrypted computers.\n\n9. The Qakbot administrators use a system of tiered\n\nservers, described here as Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3, to\n\ncontrol and communicate with the Qakbot malware installed on\n\ninfected computers. Tier 1 servers are computers infected with\n\nQakbot that have an additional software “supernode” module\n\ninstalled that make them part of the control infrastructure for\n\nthe botnet. Some Tier 1 servers are believed to be located in\n\n\n-----\n\nthe United States. The Tier 2 and Tier 3 servers are rented and\n\ncontrolled by the Qakbot administrators and are not located in\n\nthe United States. The primary purpose of the Tier 1 and Tier 2\n\nservers is to forward communications containing encrypted data\n\nbetween Qakbot infected computers and the Tier 3 server, which\n\ncontrols the botnet.\n\n10. Qakbot malware installed on infected computers\n\ncontains a list of approximately 10-20 Tier 1 servers identified\n\nby IP address. At regular intervals, ranging from one to four\n\nminutes, the Qakbot malware directs victim computers to attempt\n\nto communicate with each Tier 1 server on the list in sequence.\n\nAfter establishing a communication channel with a Tier 1 server,\n\nthe malware uses the victim computer to send and receive\n\nmessages to the Tier 3 server through the Tier 1 and Tier 2\n\nservers. Using the Tier 3 server, the Qakbot administrators—or\n\nothers to whom they have sold access—send instructions to\n\ninfected computers. Those instructions can include downloading\n\nand installing on the victim computer a new version of the\n\nQakbot malware or other malware, including ransomware. All of\n\nthese communications are encrypted using keys known to the\n\nQakbot administrators (and, as a result of this investigation,\n\nto the FBI).\n\n**C.** **Remote Access, Searches, and Seizures**\n\n11. The FBI has\n\nidentified the IP addresses of approximately 700,000\n\ncomputers worldwide that had an active Qakbot infection between\n\nSeptember 2022 and June 15, 2023. Of those, approximately\n\n\n-----\n\n200,000 infected computers appeared to be both currently\n\ninfected and located in the United States.\n\n12. These computers have been identified as infected with\n\nthe Qakbot malware because they communicated over the internet\n\nwith servers that are part of the Qakbot botnet. The Qakbot\n\nmalware contains a list of Tier 1 servers, as well as the keys\n\nto encrypt communications with those servers. Only infected\n\ncomputers, therefore, are capable of successfully communicating\n\nwith the Qakbot Tier 1, Tier 2 and Tier 3 servers.\n\n13. Infected computers located in the United States\n\nconstitute “protected computers” within the meaning of Rule\n\n41(b)(6)(B) and 18 U.S.C. § 1030(e)(2)(B) because they are used\n\nin or affecting interstate or foreign commerce or communication,\n\nbased on their connection to the internet. The infected\n\ncomputers have been damaged within the meaning of Rule\n\n41(b)(6)(B) and 18 U.S.C. § 1030(e)(8) because the Qakbot\n\nmalware has impaired the integrity and availability of data,\n\nprograms, systems, and information on the infected computers.\n\n14. The thousands of infected computers with IP addresses\n\nthat were geolocated in the United States appeared to be located\n\nin five or more judicial districts, including, but not limited\n\nto the following: Central District of California, Eastern\n\nDistrict of California, Northern District of California,\n\nSouthern District of California, Eastern District of New York,\n\nSouthern District of Florida, Northern District of Illinois,\n\nDistrict of Nevada, Southern District of Texas, and Eastern\n\nDistrict of Virginia.\n\n\n-----\n\n15. Through its investigation, the FBI has gained a\n\ncomprehensive understanding of the structure and function of the\n\nQakbot botnet. Based on that knowledge, the FBI has developed a\n\nmeans to identify infected computers, collect information from\n\nthem about the infection, disconnect them from the Qakbot\n\nbotnet, and prevent the Qakbot administrators from further\n\ncommunicating with those infected computers. This warrant would\n\nauthorize certain aspects of that identification and search\n\nprocess as described below:\n\na. First, the FBI will identify the current Tier 1\n\nservers (which are also Qakbot infected victim computers) based\n\non information collected by the FBI .\n\nb. Second, an FBI-controlled computer will contact\n\neach of those Tier 1 servers using commands built into the\n\nQakbot malware and Qakbot encryption keys known to the FBI. The\n\nFBI will instruct each Tier 1 server to download and install an\n\nFBI-created module that replaces the “supernode” module in the\n\nalready-installed Qakbot malware (“FBI Supernode Module”). The\n\nFBI Supernode Module contains a new encryption key that will\n\nmake it impossible for the Qakbot administrators to communicate\n\nwith the Tier 1 servers. The proposed warrant would authorize\n\nreplacement of the “supernode” module to allow the FBI to\n\ncommunicate with and search infected computers that make up the\n\nbotnet. The proposed warrant therefore also authorizes law\n\nenforcement officers to seize or copy from the infected\n\ncomputers electronically stored information related to the\n\nQakbot malware, including encryption keys and server lists used\n\n\n-----\n\nby the Qakbot administrators to communicate with computers that\n\nare part of the Qakbot infrastructure.\n\nc. Third, the FBI will contact each of those Tier 1\n\nservers using commands built into the Qakbot malware. The FBI\n\nwill instruct those Tier 1 servers to communicate with an FBI\ncontrolled server (the “FBI Server”)[3] instead of the Qakbot\n\nTier 2 servers. At this point all communications from infected\n\nbotnet computers will be routed through the Tier 1 servers to\n\nthe FBI Server, rather than to the Qakbot Tier 2 and Tier 3\n\nservers.\n\nd. Fourth, infected computers subject to this\n\nwarrant that make up the botnet would then communicate with the\n\nFBI Server instead of the Tier 3 server. As noted above, the\n\nQakbot malware instructs the infected computers to contact the\n\nTier 3 server every one to four minutes. When those infected\n\ncomputers contact the FBI Server, the server will instruct them\n\nto download a second file created by law enforcement (“the\n\nQakbot Uninstaller”). This warrant would authorize this action,\n\nwith the intent that computers in the United States that are\n\ninfected with the Qakbot malware will download the Qakbot\n\nUninstaller from the FBI Server via the FBI-controlled Tier 1\n\nservers. The proposed warrant therefore authorizes law\n\nenforcement officers to seize or copy from the infected\n\ncomputers electronically stored information related to the\n\nQakbot malware, including IP addresses and routing information,\n\n3 Depending on technical requirements the FBI may deploy a\ngroup or cluster of servers to perform the function of the FBI\nServer.\n\n\n-----\n\nnecessary to determine whether the infected computer continues\n\nto be controlled by the Qakbot botnet.\n\n16. The FBI Server will be a dead end. It will not\n\nfurther route or relay communications received from the infected\n\ncomputers. It will not capture content from the infected\n\ncomputers. However, the FBI Server will collect the IP address\n\nand associated routing information of the infected computers for\n\nvictim notification purposes. To facilitate that capture, U.S.\n\nauthorities will also seek separate pen register / trap and\n\ntrace orders pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §§ 3121 et seq. for the FBI\n\nServer.\n\n17. The FBI Supernode Module and the Qakbot Uninstaller do\n\nnot collect content from the infected computers, nor do they\n\nalter the functionality of the infected computers’ operating\n\nsystems, files, or software, except as expressly provided in\n\nthis affidavit. The FBI Supernode Module and the Qakbot\n\nUninstaller do not remediate malware that was already installed\n\non the infected computer through Qakbot, such as ransomware or\n\nother malware that steals financial credentials. However, the\n\nQakbot Uninstaller is designed to prevent additional malware\n\nfrom being installed on the infected computer through the Qakbot\n\nbotnet by untethering the victim computer from the botnet.\n\n18. The FBI has extensively tested the FBI Supernode\n\nModule and the Qakbot Uninstaller to ensure that they operate\n\nproperly and do not impact any other files or services on the\n\ninfected computer. The FBI has also conducted a technical\n\nevaluation of the computer source code of these files to ensure\n\n\n-----\n\nthat they will not adversely affect the victim computers or non\nQakbot software operating on those victim computers.\n\n**IV.** **TIME AND MANNER OF EXECUTION**\n\n19. I request, pursuant to Rule 41(e)(2), that the Court\n\nauthorize the distribution of the FBI Supernode Module and the\n\nQakbot Uninstaller to computers infected with Qakbot malware in\n\nthe United States for a period of fourteen days..\n\n20. Because infected computers may attempt to communicate\n\nwith the servers that are part of the Qakbot botnet\n\ninfrastructure at any time, good cause exists to permit the\n\nexecution of the requested warrant at any time in the day or\n\nnight.\n\n**V.** **DELAYED NOTIFICATION**\n\n21. I request, pursuant to Rule 41(f)(3) and 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 3103a(b), that the Court authorize the officers executing this\n\nwarrant to delay notice until thirty days after the collection\n\nauthorized by the warrant has been completed, including\n\nextensions. There is reason to believe that providing immediate\n\nnotification of the warrant may have an adverse result, as\n\ndefined in 18 U.S.C. § 2705. Providing immediate notice to the\n\nsubscriber or user of the infected computer would seriously\n\njeopardize the ongoing investigation, as such a disclosure would\n\nlikely become known to the Qakbot administrators and would give\n\nthem an opportunity to destroy evidence, change patterns of\n\nbehavior, notify confederates, and flee from prosecution. See\n\n18 U.S.C. § 3103a(b)(1). The proposed search warrant does not\n\nauthorize the seizure of any tangible property. See 18 U.S.C.\n\n\n-----\n\n§ 3103a(b)(2). Further, to the extent that the warrant\n\nauthorizes the seizure of any wire or electronic communication\n\n(as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 2510) or any stored wire or\n\nelectronic information, there is reasonable necessity for the\n\nseizure for the reasons set forth above. See id.\n\n22. In the event that providing notice to the subscriber\n\nor user of the infected computer no longer seriously jeopardizes\n\nthe ongoing investigation, U.S. authorities will take steps to\n\nprovide such notification earlier than thirty days after the\n\ncollection authorized by the warrant has been completed,\n\nincluding extensions.\n\n**VI. CONCLUSION**\n\n23. For all the reasons described above, there is probable\n\ncause for a warrant to use remote access to search electronic\n\nstorage media described in Attachment A and to seize or copy\n\nelectronically stored information described in Attachment B.\n\nAttested to by the applicant in\naccordance with the requirements\nof Fed.
