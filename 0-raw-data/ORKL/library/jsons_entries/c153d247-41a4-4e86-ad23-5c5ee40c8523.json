    "plain_text": "# CASE STUDY: OPERATION AURORA\n\n\nTriumfant has performed extensive research into the behaviors of the recent attack directed at Google called Operation\nAurora. This case study provides a detailed description of how Triumfant would detect, analyze and remediate the attack\non an endpoint machine running the Triumfant agent.\n\nIn the interest of full disclosure, Triumfant had no direct interaction with the attack either directly on Triumfant’s own\nendpoints or indirectly through a Triumfant customer. The analysis is based on detailed information collected through a\nvariety of publically available research performed by reliable sources that performed hands-on analysis of the attack.\nBased on this research, Triumfant is fully confident that our software would have detected the attack and built a\nremediation that would have restored the machine to its pre-attack condition.\n\nThe Operation Aurora attack falls squarely into one of the classes of attacks that Triumfant excels at detecting: targeted\nattacks engineered to evade traditional network and endpoint protections. While the actual attack vector used was not\nexceptionally sophisticated, the attack was created to have a digital signature that would not be detected by antivirus\ntools. The attack also took steps to protect and obscure itself from detection once it infected a machine. The case study\nsteps through the process in four parts: initial detection, diagnosis, the assimilation of data about the attack into the\nTriumfant knowledge base, and remediation of the affected machine.\n\n### Detection\n\nThe malicious code used by Operation Aurora created several service keys during three specific steps: execution of the\ndropper, the first stage of installation, and the second stage of installation. Some of these keys are subsequently deleted\nbut at least one was persistent. The appearance of one or more of these keys would be interpreted as a marker of\npotential malicious activity by the Triumfant real-time malware scan and would therefore trigger the detection process. [i]\n\nThe first step in the detection process would be a request by the agent to the server requesting permission for the agent\nto execute a full scan of the machine. The purpose of this scan is to capture all of the changes to that machine since the\nprevious scan results were processed as part of the normal agent/server interaction that occurs every 24 hours. The\nTriumfant server would respond within seconds, authorizing the scan and throttling up the agent to complete the scan as\nrapidly as possible, collecting all 200,000 plus attributes in under a minute. The resulting scan would captures the state\nof the machine immediately after infection, providing the raw material for diagnosis so the analytics could verify the\nmachine is under attack and identify all of the primary and secondary artifacts of the attack.\n\n### Diagnosis\n\nThe Triumfant server would receive the full scan, recognize that it was executed as a result of suspicious behavior, and\nimmediately compare it to the adaptive reference model (the unique context built by our patented analytics). The result\nof this comparison would be a set of anomalous files and registry keys. The fact that the files and keys associated with\nOperation Aurora have random names would guarantee that they would be perceived as anomalous despite the fact that\nhumans might tend to confuse them with legitimate Windows services. Further analysis would then be applied to the\nanomaly set to identify important characteristics and functional impacts. In this case the salient characteristics are an\nanomalous service and a number of anomalous system32 files.\n\nThe discovery of an anomalous service would cause the Triumfant server to build a probe to be sent to the agent for\nexecution to gather more data to complete the analysis. In this case, the probe would contain a list of all of the\nanomalous attributes found by the server during its analysis. Such probes leverage a series of correlation functions\ndesigned to partition the anomalous attributes associated with an attack into related groups. For Operation Aurora\nthese correlation functions would group all of the anomalous attributes and then perform a risk assessment on this\ngroup. In this specific case, this analysis would find that the malicious attack is communicating over the internet.\n\nThe cumulative results of the correlation and risk assessment would then be sent back to the Triumfant server. This new\ninformation is then processed and classified as an “Anomalous Application” with a complete analysis of the changes that\ncomposed the attack. This data would show the full set of changes associated with the attack such as files, registry keys,\n\n\n-----\n\n# CASE STUDY: OPERATION AURORA\n\n\nprocesses, ports, services, and event logs that were added, changed, or deleted as part of the attack. The data about the\nattacks would be posted at the console and the Triumfant server would alert the appropriate personnel based on the\nestablished reporting and alert protocols. Personnel could then access the correlated attack information and the\ncorresponding risk assessment who could then take appropriate actions including the ability to save the analysis to\nreadily share the data with CIRT and forensics teams.\n\n### Knowledge Base\n\nTriumfant has the ability to save the analysis from any anomalous activity and leverage that data to create what\nTriumfant calls a Recognition Filter that becomes a permanent part of the knowledge base contained in the adaptive\nreference model. These Recognition Filters have a number of benefits. First, they provide a very precise mechanism for\nstoring and sharing knowledge about an incident. Second, they allow the system to search for any other instances of\nthat particular condition on other machines. Third, they enable the operator to pre-authorize automatic responses such as automatic remediation - should that incident be detected in the future.\n\nIn the case of Operation Aurora, an analyst could save the analysis and build a filter specifically about this attack. Once\nbuilt, the filter could be used to check other endpoint machines (the entire population or specified groups) for\ninfection. This mechanism uses acquired knowledge to address broad attacks before they have the chance to spread\nbeyond their initial penetration. These filters are also more resilient than digital signatures because they use wildcarding\nto continue to detect the attack even as it morphs its basic signature over time to avoid traditional signature based tools.\n\n### Remediation\n\nThe ability to identify and correlate all of the changes associated with any attack provides a depth of information that\nenables Triumfant to build a contextual and situational remediation that surgically and reliably removes the components\nof that attack without reimaging the machine. This remediation is built to exactly match the attributes of the anomalous\napplication, in this case Operation Aurora, on an attribute by attribute basis.\n\nFor Operation Aurora, Triumfant would construct a remediation to address all of the changes associated with the attack,\nrestoring the altered attributes to their pre-attack condition. This includes the changes Aurora makes to affected\nmachine’s configuration settings to either execute or hide itself. The files added to the machine would be deleted, and\nany files deleted or corrupted would be remediated using Triumfant’s patent pending donor technology.[ii]\n\n### Summary\n\nOperation Aurora is illustrative of the targeted and well engineered attacks that characterize the evolving threats\nbusinesses and government agencies face daily. Based on the available data regarding Operation Aurora, Triumfant can\nsay with confidence that Resolution Manager would have detected the attack, identified changes associated with the\nprimary and collateral damage done to the affected machines, and used that data to build a remediation to address the\nspecific elements of the attack. Within five minutes of the infection Triumfant would have analyzed the attack and\ncreated a remediation to return the machine to its pre-attack condition pending confirmation by the administrator.  This\nability to detect and remediate the attacks that evade traditional endpoint protections demonstrates the unique\ncapabilities of Triumfant’s technology.\n\ni Triumfant uses two continuous scan cycles. One is a scan for markers of malicious activity that runs approximately\nevery thirty seconds. The second is a continuous scan of every attribute on the machine that identifies and collects\nchanges to those attributes and communicates them to the server on a 24 hour reporting cycle.\n\nii Triumfant leverages the knowledge contained in the adaptive reference model to find another machine that has the\nproper version of corrupted or missing files – validated to the specific release number and MD5 hash - and uses that\nmachine as a donor to repair the affected machine. This technology is patent pending.\n\n\n-----",
