This is the first campaign targeting the region since 2017._\n\n## Overview\n\nProofpoint researchers began tracking a prolific actor (referred to as TA542) in 2014 when\nreports first emerged about the appearance of the group’s signature payload, Emotet (aka\nGeodo) [1][2]. TA542 consistently uses the latest version of this malware, launching\nwidespread email campaigns on an international scale that affect North America, Central\nAmerica, South America, Europe, Asia, and Australia.\n\nEarlier versions of Emotet had a module that was used to commit banking fraud, specifically\ntargeting German, Austrian, and Swiss banks [7], and for years, the malware was widely\nclassified as a banking Trojan. However, later versions of Emotet no longer loaded its own\nbanking module, and instead loaded third party banking malware. More recently, we have\nobserved Emotet delivering third-party payloads such as Qbot, The Trick, IcedID, and\nGootkit. Additionally, Emotet loads its modules for spamming, credential stealing, email\nharvesting, and spreading on local networks.\n\nTA542 typically distributes high volume email campaigns consisting of hundreds of\nthousands or even millions of messages targeting all industries. TA542 is currently one of the\nmost prolific actors in the entire threat landscape. With TA542’s international reach and high\nvolume campaign strategy, we expect Emotet use to continue to grow in the upcoming\nquarters.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1: Indexed volume of email messages containing Emotet, TA542’s signature payload_\n_(from 5/1/17-5/1/19)_\n\n## Evolution of Emotet\n\nVersion 1 of Emotet originated around May 2014 as a banking Trojan, which at first was only\nknown to load its own banking module targeting German and Austrian banks [1][2].\n\nVersion 2 was detected in fall 2014, when it began using the Automatic Transfer System\n(ATS), and had a modular structure with a spamming module, banking module, DDoS\nmodule, and address book stealing module [7].\n\nVersion 3 of Emotet appeared in January of 2015, containing stealth modifications designed\nto prevent its detection by anti-malware defenses, and soon began targeting Swiss banks [7].\n\nVersion 4 was initially observed around December 1, 2016, spreading via the RIG 4.0 exploit\nkit [9]. Proofpoint researchers next observed it spreading via emails with links to zipped\nexecutables or JScript in February 2017. Starting in April 2017, TA542 began consistently\ndistributing this version in high-volume campaigns. This version does not use its own\nbanking module, but primarily loads other modules and third-party banking malware.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2: Timeline of major milestones in TA542 activity_\n\n## Emotet Modules\n\nSince its introduction, Emotet has used a number of modules:\n\nMain module: Downloads other modules from a command and control (C&C) server.\n\nSpam module: This module has been present in most versions of Emotet. The spam module\nfacilitates the continued spread of the Emotet botnet by sending out emails with links or\nattachments that lead to Emotet. “Distribution is performed using previously scraped mail\naccounts, which are sent to each spambot” from the C&C [8].\n\nCredential stealing: This module has been present in most versions of Emotet. In version 4, it\nsteals credentials from web browsers and mail clients, using NirSoft tools Mail PassView and\nWebBrowser PassView [8].\n\nSpreader module: The network spreader module, introduced in September 2017,\nenumerates network resources. It attempts to connect to them “as the currently logged on\nuser before jumping into the bruting portion of the code.” [10] The brute force attack happens\nby enumerating available logins and attempting passwords from a hardcoded list. For every\nsuccessful login, a file is copied into the new network folder. A service is configured on the\nremote system to execute the file.\n\nEmail harvesting: This module was introduced in October 2018. It exfiltrates email content\nfrom the infected machines to the C&C. Specifically targeted components of email include\nthe email subject, body, the name of the sender and the receiver, along with his or her\ncorresponding email address. This information is only stolen for emails sent/received in the\nlast 180 days. “If the body is longer than 16384 characters, it is truncated to this size plus the\nstring ...” [6].\n\n\n-----\n\nAddress book stealer: This module, first seen in 2017, performs a relationship analysis\nbetween sender and recipient in the current user’s Outlook data file. It extracts the name and\naddress list from each profile’s address book and then undergoes a recursive scan on each\nemail stored in the data file. Information about each sender and recipient is extracted, which\nis then used to make inferences about the relationship and refine its targeting, that is then\npassed to the spam module. [11]\n\nDDoS module: No longer active, a module from early versions of Emotet [7].\n\nBanking module: No longer active, a module from early versions of Emotet [7].\n\n## Delivery\n\nAs with many threat actors monitored by Proofpoint researchers, TA542 leverages social\nengineering mechanisms to increase infection rates. They frequently use stolen branding\nand urgent subject lines in order to deceive potential victims. They also compose emails in\nthe appropriate language for the targeted country. TA542 uses a variety of social engineering\nmechanisms and strategies, but the most common are described below.\n\nEmail Subjects\n\nTA542 primarily uses generic subject lines that usually refer to transactions, payments, and\ninvoices. Examples include: “ACH Payment Info”, “Payment Notification”, “Transaction for\nyour invoice”, “Overdue payment”, “Paid Invoices”, “Sales Invoice”, “Status update”,\n“Document needed”, “New Order”, “Receipt for your invoice”.\n\nEmail Body\n\nOften, the body of the message is simple, and consists of only a few sentences. Email\nbodies usually include brief verbiage about missed or upcoming payments, incoming\nfinancial statements, or invoices. However, Proofpoint researchers have observed more\nsophisticated examples in which TA542 included stolen company branding.\n\nEmail Thread Hijacking\n\nThread hijacking is a technique in which threat actors reply to existing benign email\nconversations with a malicious attachment or URL. Since early April 2019, TA542 began to\nconsistently utilize this technique to distribute Emotet, sending what appear to be replies to\nlegitimate emails [4][5]. While the technique is not novel or original, it is still effective because\nas victims have seen these email chains before, they may believe that they are interacting\nwith a person they trust, making them more inclined to open attachments and links in the\nmessage body.\n\nThe appearance of thread hijacking followed reports of a new module that can steal emails\nfrom the victim’s machines in October 2018 [5].\n\n\n-----\n\nBrand Abuse\n\nTA542 abuses the branding of dozens of high-profile companies, including them in the body\nof the email, Microsoft Word document attachments, PDF attachments, and in the malicious\nURL paths. Commonly abused brands include shipping companies (such as DHL and UPS),\ntelecommunication companies (such as T-Mobile and O2), large financial institutions (such\nas TD Bank, Barclays, and RBC) and others.\n\nHoliday Lures\n\nTA542 also drafts holiday-themed lures to target consumers during major holidays.\nProofpoint researchers have observed seasonal upticks in TA542 Emotet activity, especially\naround Christmas, Thanksgiving, Black Friday, and Cyber Monday, likely targeting holiday\nshoppers.\n\nGeographical targeting\n\nTA542 frequently targets certain core geographies such as Germany, United Kingdom,\nUnited States, and Latin America. TA542 also targets other countries, but less consistently.\nEach region is targeted with appropriate language translations in email bodies, subjects,\nfilenames, and geographically relevant branding. Known targeted countries are listed in\nTable 1 below:\n\n**Country** **Language** **Note**\n\nGermany German Consistently targeted\n\nAustria German Intermittently targeted: First targeted in 2015; since then\nintermittently targeted until April 9, 2019, when we began to\nobserve regular targeting\n\nSwitzerland German Intermittently targeted: First targeted in 2015; since then\nintermittently targeted until April 9, 2019, when we began to\nobserve regular targeting\n\n\nUnited\nKingdom\n\nUnited\nStates\n\n\nEnglish Consistently targeted\n\nEnglish Consistently targeted\n\n\nCanada French Intermittently targeted\n\n\n-----\n\nJapan Japanese Proofpoint observed campaigns on April 12-16, 2019\n\n\nChina,\nHong\nKong,\nTaiwan\n\n\nChinese Proofpoint observed campaigns on April 12-16, 2019\n\n\nAustralia English Proofpoint observed several campaigns in April 2019\n\n\nLatin\nAmerica\n\n\nSpanish,\nPortuguese\n\n\nProofpoint regularly observes countries targeted in this region,\nincluding: Mexico, Uruguay, Argentina, Colombia, Chile,\nBolivia, Paraguay, Brazil, Ecuador, Costa Rica, El Salvador,\nGuatemala\n\n\nCaribbean Spanish Countries such as the Dominican Republic\n\nPoland Polish Last observed in 2017\n\n_Update: Proofpoint researchers detected a campaign targeting_\n_Poland on May 15, 2019_\n\n_Table 1: Description of the countries with observed Emotet email campaigns. Note that this_\n_list is not considered exhaustive._\n\n## Example Emails\n\nThis section highlights email lures from some of the more notable TA542 campaigns.\n\nThe figure below shows the following email messages:\n\nGerman language email targeting Switzerland containing a malicious URL on April 29,\n2019 (top left).\nEnglish language email targeting the United States and utilizing thread hijacking on\nApril 30, 2019 (top right).\nChinese language email targeting Taiwan on April 12, 2019. This email is notable\nbecause, for a few days in April, TA542 experimented with targeting this region as well\nas China, Hong Kong, and Australia (bottom left).\nSpanish language email targeting a company in the Dominican Republic on May 3,\n2019. This particular email is notable because, while Latin American countries are\nfrequently targeted, the neighboring Caribbean countries are rarely targeted (bottom\nright).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3: Example emails showing a variety of geographic targeting by TA542, including_\n_language localization_\n\nThe example emails below show the seasonal customization used in the days leading up to\nChristmas and Black Friday in 2018:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4: Example emails showing holiday email lures_\n\n## Attachments / URLs\n\nThe malicious content included in the emails sent by this threat actor is generally either a\nURL or an attachment, although Proofpoint researchers have observed some instances in\nwhich both were included at the same time. The actor maintains a diverse arsenal of\nattachments and URLs in order to vary their attacks. TA542 frequently uses some formats,\nsuch as attached Microsoft Word documents with macros and URLs linking to similar\ndocuments. The actor uses other formats such as PDFs and JScript intermittently. Finally,\nformats such as password-protected Zip files containing Microsoft Word documents appear\nto be experimental and it remains to be seen if they will be adopted for broader use.\n\nAttachments\n\nThe following is a list of known types of email attachments used by TA542. All types of\nattachments are first-stage downloaders that attempt to download the Emotet payload or\nanother intermediary downloader, as in the case of PDFs, from one of several (typically five)\nhardcoded payload URLs. Many unique attachments can contain the same set of payload\nURLs. TA542 also exchanges the URL sets several times a day.\n\nMicrosoft Word documents with macros\nPDFs with links to Microsoft Word documents with macros\nPDFs with links to Zip archives with JScript files inside\nPassword-protected Zip archives with JScript files inside\n\n\n-----\n\nPassword-protected Zip files containing Microsoft Word documents\n\nURLs\n\nThe following is a list of known types of URLs that the actor embeds in the emails. The URLs\nare frequently hosted on compromised vulnerable sites, including vulnerable WordPress\ninstallations. The actor typically adds a nested structure of one or more folders on the\ncompromised site and hosts a malicious PHP script that initiates the download of the\npayload. The folder names are sometimes synchronized with the rest of the campaign\ntheme, and might use stolen branding.\n\nURLs linking to Microsoft Word documents with macros\nURLs linking to Zipped Microsoft Word documents with macros\nURLs linking to Jscript\nURLs linking to Zipped JScript\nURLs linking to Zipped executables (not used since 2017)\n\nExperiments\n\nApril 3, 2019: First use of password-protected Zip files containing JScript. The actor\nhas intermittently used this technique several more times.\nApril 4, 2019: First use of password-protected Zip files containing Microsoft Word\ndocuments. At the time of writing of this analysis, the actor has only used this method\nonce.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5: TA542 most commonly uses Microsoft Word documents with macros. The actor_\n_periodically updates the visual lure used in the document. This collage shows many of the_\n_lures used._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6: PDF attachment examples used by this threat actor. The actor commonly abuses_\n_branding of large financial institutions, telecommunications companies, and more in the_\n_PDFs_\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn the last two years, TA542 has become one of the most prolific threat actors in the overall\nthreat landscape. Leveraging a robust Botnet known as Emotet, TA542 orchestrates highvolume, international email campaigns that distribute hundreds of thousands or even millions\nof messages per day. They use Emotet to download third-party banking malware such as\nThe Trick, IcedID, and Gootkit, and to facilitate the continued spread of their botnet via a\nnumber of modules. As TA542 continues to operate at near-global scale, we can expect\nEmotet use to grow in the upcoming quarters.\n\n## References\n\n[1] https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/new-banking-malware-usesnetwork-sniffing-for-data-theft/\n\n[2] [https://web.archive.org/web/20140708121405/https://www.abuse.ch/?p=7930](https://web.archive.org/web/20140708121405/https:/www.abuse.ch/?p=7930)\n\n\n-----\n\n[3] https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/proofpoint-threat-report-banking-trojansdominate-malware-landscape-first-months\n\n[4] https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/nz/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/furtheremotet-evolution-operators-hijacking-existing-email-threads-to-deliver-malware\n\n[5] https://cofense.com/emotet-gang-switches-highly-customized-templates-utilizing-stolenemail-content-victims/\n\n[6] https://www.kryptoslogic.com/blog/2018/10/emotet-awakens-with-new-campaign-of-massemail-exfiltration/\n\n[7] [https://securelist.com/the-banking-trojan-emotet-detailed-analysis/69560/](https://securelist.com/the-banking-trojan-emotet-detailed-analysis/69560/)\n\n[8] [https://www.cert.pl/en/news/single/analysis-of-emotet-v4/](https://www.cert.pl/en/news/single/analysis-of-emotet-v4/)\n\n[9] [https://twitter.com/kafeine/status/804360636847321088](https://twitter.com/kafeine/status/804360636847321088)\n\n[10] https://www.fidelissecurity.com/threatgeek/threat-intelligence/emotet-network-spreadercomponent/\n\n[11] [https://www.gdata.de/blog/2017/10/30110-emotet-beutet-outlook-aus](https://www.gdata.de/blog/2017/10/30110-emotet-beutet-outlook-aus)\n\nSubscribe to the Proofpoint Blog\n\n\n-----",
