The initial vector information was found on Twitter.](https://twitter.com/blackorbird/status/1404752748919156737)**\nThis RAT disguises as famous Indian dating applications like Trendbanter, Rita, Ponam\nand instant messaging applications like SignalLite and HangOn.\n\nLet us analyse one of the famous dating application “Trendbanter”.\n\nFigure 1: Trendbanter App\nOnce installed the “Trendbanter” APK disguises as a legitimate WhatsApp app icon in the\napp drawer to trick the user to open the app, however the app’s internal appinfo shows the\noriginal app name, “TrendbanterNew”as shown in Figure 2.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2: Fake WhatsApp Icon created by Trendbanter\nIt then proceeds to set “android:debuggable=true” from theAndroidManifest.xml, which\nmakes it easier for the threat actor to access the application data and can even run\narbitrary code under that application permission. as shown in Figure 3.\n\nFigure 3: Debuggable app permission from AndroidManifest.xml\nUpon execution, the installed app’s device gets registered with Firebase C&C with the\nfollowing details such as ipaddr, rip (remote ip), manufacturer’s name, phone model, OS\nversion, IMEI, phone number and location information as shown in Figure 4.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4: Register Device Details with Firebase C&C\nPJobRAT then proceeds to abuse the Android Accessibility Service to steal WhatsApp\nmessages and contacts as shown in Figure 5.\n\nFigure 5:\n\nSteals data from WhatsApp\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6: Steals contact Information\nPJobRAT uses two modes of communication.\n\n**Mode 1**\n\nTo establish a C&C channel this malware uses the Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)\nwhich is a mobile application development platform that allows threat actors to send\ninstructions from the server to the client using the PUSH message function. This allows the\nthreat actor to trigger and execute RAT commands by PUSH notification.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7: Firebase Cloud Message Communication\nThe C&C commands list is as shown in Figure 8.\n\n**Mode 2**\n\n\nFigure 8: RAT commands\n\n\nElse, this Trojan then uploads harvested files to the remote server via a HTTP request.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 9: Uploading the collected information to the server\nThis RAT also searches for the files having the extensions .pdf, .doc, .docx, .xls, .xlsx,\n.ppt, .pptx, to upload to the C&C Server as shown in Figure 10.\n\nFigure 10: Uploading files to C&C server\nAlso collects the following information from the victims’ device and uploads it to the server:\n\nAddress book\n\nAudio files\n\nImage files\n\n\n-----\n\nList of available files in external storage\n\nList of installed Apps\n\nPhone number\n\nSMS information\n\nVideo files\n\nWIFI and Geo information\n\nAt K7, we protect all our customers from such threats.
