The global hacking campaign went after a diverse range of\ntargets, from video game companies and telecommunications enterprises to universities and\nnon-profit organizations. The five individuals were reportedly connected to the hacking group\nknown as APT41. At the time of writing, they remain fugitives, but two Malaysian citizens\nhave been arrested for aiding the hackers.\n\n\n-----\n\nThree related indictments unsealed by the Justice Department laid out the group s wide\nrange of malicious activities, including crypto-jacking and ransomware attacks. Most of the\nactivities appear to have been done for profit, but some were for espionage purposes.\n\nJustice officials say that the group's intrusions allowed the hackers to steal source code,\ncustomer account data, and personally identifiable information (PII). Other notable activities\ninclude defrauding video game companies by manipulating in-game resources, and\nlaunching a ransomware attack on the network of a non-profit organization dedicated to\ncombating global poverty.\n\nThe hackers used publicly available exploits and common vulnerabilities, which are listed in\nthe [official report. They also employed sophisticated hacking techniques to gain and maintain](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/seven-international-cyber-defendants-including-apt41-actors-charged-connection-computer)\naccess to the victim's computer networks. The official report outlined how the team used\n\"supply chain attacks\" in which they compromised software providers and modified the code\nthey were giving their customers. This also allowed the threat actors to compromise the\ncustomers and spread their influence further.\n\nThis is not the first time that APT41 activities have been scrutinized — the group has been\nactive for some time. Just last May, Trend Micro connected the group to ransomware attacks\non Taiwanese organizations. The new ransomware family, which we dubbed ColdLock, is\npotentially destructive as it appears to target databases and email servers for encryption.\n\nThe attack chain of ransomware incidents in Taiwan\n\nThe Trend Micro Research team investigated the ColdLock ransomware attack, which\nactually targeted the energy industry in Taiwan. The ransomware attack chain is outlined in\nFigure 1; however, we currently do not know the initial arrival vector of this threat into a\npotential victim's network. Our analysis focused on the way the attacker spreads the\nransomware to infect as many machines as possible.\n\n1. The threat actor enters a victim's network environment and obtains the account\n\nusername and password of the company headquarters' active directory server.\n2. After logging in to the active directory server, the threat actor modifies the active\n\ndirectory server group policy object — this includes a request that all domain account\nmembers create a scheduled task and execute the malware.\n3. In the final step, the other subsidiary active directory servers and all the endpoint\n\nmachines will download the scheduled task and execute the ransomware.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure.1 The attacker uses an Active Directory (AD) scheduled task to deploy the\nransomware in the customer environment.\nScheduled tasks play a very important role in this incident. The threat actors use a scheduled\ntask command to spread and infect a victim's environment. The screenshot in Figure 2\nshows how the threat actor uses SMB and internal IIS Web Service to copy \"lc.tmp\" (the\nmain ransomware loader in this incident) to other victims' host machines. After that, the\nPowerShell command executes the main ransomware loader.\n\nFigure 2. How a scheduled task delivers the malware to a victim's environment\n\n\n-----\n\nThe right tool for the job\n\nBefore the ransomware attack, the attacker was likely already hiding in the victims'\nenvironments for some time. We found the same customized loaders installed as Windows\nservices in every victim's environment, and those infected machines were in positions that\nallowed them to reach other machines under the subnets.\n\nThe loaders decrypted the next-stage payloads, which were either embedded inside itself or\nstored on the disk as separate files. The next-stage payloads were CobaltStrike in this series\nof incidents. After the loader and payload pairs were successfully installed, the attacker\nstarted poking around the environments with tools like password dumpers and HTTP\ntunneling tools — then the ransomware attacks were launched one month later.\n\nMore than just a single occurrence\n\nDuring the investigation, we discovered more incidents that are possibly related to the one\ndiscussed above. We did this by checking the indicator overlap and the C&C infrastructure\noverlap. Based on the distribution of the linked indicators, the attacker(s) appears to be\ninterested in energy, retail, and telecom companies, mainly in Southeast Asia. They mostly\nconduct espionage activities — lurking in the environments for a long period and packing the\ndata that interested them. They also seem to be updating the backdoors and toolsets they\nuse.\n\nPossible link to Chinese espionage\n\nThe C&C server 104[.]233[.]224[.]227 was hosted under a small hosting service with only 64\nIPs under it. The IP range was registered to an address in Inner Mongolia, China. The C&C\nserver was abandoned several days after the incidents, and now the IP is hosting a\nSimplified-Chinese site.\n\nTrend Micro Solutions\n\nSophisticated hacking groups have versatile tools and are persistent threats.
