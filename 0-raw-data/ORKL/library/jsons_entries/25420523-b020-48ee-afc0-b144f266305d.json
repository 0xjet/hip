A spokesperson for the Rome Holy\nSee did not want to comment.\n\n## The complicated China-Vatican relations\n\nRelations between China and the Vatican have improved in recent years but are still on thin ice. The two broke all diplomatic ties in 1951. At\nthe time, Beijing's fledgling communist rule begun cracking down on all religious groups with the aim of bringing local leadership structures\nunder the Communist Party's control.\n\nAfter the fallout, China began appointing its own party-approved bishops across the country, a move that split the Chinese Catholic community.\n\nA part continued attending masses at official government-mandated churches with party-imposed bishops, while the other attended\nunderground churches -- unrecognized by both China and the Vatican, but believed to have operated all these years with the Holy See's\nblessing.\n\nRelations between the China and the Holy See eventually thawed in the 2000s, as China sought a more prominet role in international affairs,\nand both parties began brokering an agreement of collaboration.\n\nThe agreement, [signed in September 2018, allowed the Pope to resume the Vatican's control over the Chinese Catholic Church by giving it the](https://www.lastampa.it/vatican-insider/en/2018/09/22/news/holy-see-and-china-sign-agreement-on-the-appointment-of-chinese-bishops-1.34046960)\npower to appoint bishops -- with the caveat that the bishops also had to receive a green light from by the Communist Party.\n\n[This agreement stands to be renewed in September later this year, and Hong Kong Holy See officials have used it as a reasoning point not to](https://cruxnow.com/vatican/2020/06/vatican-agreement-with-china-likely-to-be-renewed-archbishop-says/)\nshow public support for the protests, fearing Chinese leadership might isolate the Chinese Catholic Community again, as they did in previous\ndecades.\n\n_Article updated to remove a link to a report about the Hong Kong Archbishop of the Anglican Church that was erroneously cited. ZDNet regrets_\n_the error._\n\n**The world's most famous and dangerous APT (state-developed) malware**\n\n\n-----",
