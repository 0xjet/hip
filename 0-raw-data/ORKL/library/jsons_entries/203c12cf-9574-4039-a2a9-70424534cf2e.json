In 2021, Hydra accounted for an estimated 80%\nof all darknet market-related cryptocurrency transactions, and since 2015, the marketplace\nhas received approximately $5.2 billion in cryptocurrency.\n\nThe seizure of the Hydra servers and cryptocurrency wallets containing $25 million worth of\nbitcoin was made this morning in Germany by the German Federal Criminal Police (the\nBundeskriminalamt), in coordination with U.S. law enforcement.\n\n“The Justice Department will be relentless in our efforts to hold accountable those who\nviolate our laws – no matter where they are located or how they try to hide their crimes,” said\nAttorney General Merrick B. Garland. “Together with our German law enforcement partners,\nwe have seized the infrastructure of the world’s largest darknet market, but our work is far\n\n\n-----\n\nfrom over. We will continue to work alongside our international and interagency partners to\ndisrupt and dismantle darknet markets, and to hold those who commit their crimes on the\ndark web accountable for their acts.”\n\n“The Department of Justice will not allow darknet markets and cryptocurrency to be a safe\nhaven for money laundering and the sale of hacking tools and services,” said Deputy\nAttorney General Lisa O. Monaco. “Our message should be clear: we will continue to go after\ndarknet markets and those who exploit them. Together with our partners in Germany and\naround the world, we will continue our work to disrupt the ecosystem that allows these\ncriminal actors to operate.”\n\nHydra was an online criminal marketplace that enabled users in mainly Russian-speaking\ncountries to buy and sell illicit goods and services, including illegal drugs, stolen financial\ninformation, fraudulent identification documents, and money laundering and mixing services,\nanonymously and outside the reach of law enforcement. Transactions on Hydra were\nconducted in cryptocurrency and Hydra’s operators charged a commission for every\ntransaction conducted on Hydra.\n\nIn conjunction with the shutdown of Hydra, the department also announced criminal charges\nagainst Dmitry Olegovich Pavlov, 30, a resident of Russia, for conspiracy to distribute\nnarcotics and conspiracy to commit money laundering, in connection with his operation and\nadministration of the servers used to run Hydra.\n\n“This coordinated action sends a clear message to anyone attempting to operate or support\nan online criminal enterprise under the cover of the dark web,” said U.S. Attorney Stephanie\nM. Hinds for the Northern District of California. “The dark web is not a place criminals can\noperate with impunity or hide from U.S. law enforcement, and we will continue to use our\nsophisticated tools and expertise to dismantle and disable darknet markets. This action also\nunderscores the importance of international law enforcement collaboration. We thank\nGerman authorities and the Bundeskriminalamt, the German Federal Criminal Police Office,\nfor its valued assistance in this case.”\n\n“The darknet has been a key online marketplace for the sale of deadly drugs worldwide,”\nsaid Administrator Anne Milgram of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). “The\navailability of illicit substances and money laundering services offered by Hydra threaten the\nsafety and health of communities far and wide. Criminals on the darknet hide behind the\nillusion of anonymity, but DEA and our partners across the globe are watching. We will\ncontinue to investigate, expose, and take action against criminal networks no matter where\nthey operate. I commend the extraordinary investigative efforts of DEA’s Miami\nCounternarcotic Cyber Investigations Task Force, Cyber Support Section, and Special\nOperations Division, and the teamwork from federal and international law enforcement\npartners that led to this action.”\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Hydra darknet site provided a platform for criminals who thought they were beyond the\nreaches of law enforcement to buy and sell illegal drugs and services,” said Chief Jim Lee of\nIRS-Criminal Investigation. “Our Cyber Crimes Unit once again used their cryptocurrency\ntracking expertise to help take down this site and identify the criminal behind it. Denying\ncriminals a space to operate freely to conduct their nefarious activities is the first step in\nstopping this activity from happening altogether.”\n\n“The successful seizure of Hydra, the world's largest darknet marketplace, dismantled digital\ninfrastructures which had enabled a wide range of criminals – including Russian cyber\ncriminals, the cryptocurrency tumblers and money launderers that support them and others,\nand drug traffickers,” said FBI Director Christopher Wray. “Today’s announcement is a\ntestament to the strength and potency of our law enforcement partnerships here and around\nthe world – and another example of our strategy to broadly target the entire illicit ecosystem\nthat drives and enables crime.”\n\n“The U.S. Postal Inspection Service is dedicated to protecting the United States mail from\nbeing used to transport illegal drugs and illicit goods available on the darknet,” said Chief\nPostal Inspector Gary R. Barksdale of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service National\nHeadquarters. “The seizure of the criminal marketplace, Hydra Market, reflects the effective\ncollaboration of law enforcement to stop criminal enterprises from their illicit activity. The\nPostal Inspection Service will continue to work with our federal partners to end these criminal\norganizations regardless of where they are.”\n\n“The dismantling of the Hydra Market, the dark web’s largest supplier of illicit goods and\nservices, sends a message to these electronic criminal kingpins that think they can operate\nwith impunity,” said Special Agent in Charge Anthony Salisbury of Homeland Security\nInvestigations (HSI) Miami. “HSI will continue to work with our U.S. and international law\nenforcement partners to target these transnational criminal organizations who attempt to\nmanipulate the anonymity of the dark web to push their poison all over the world.”\n\nAccording to the indictment, vendors on Hydra could create accounts on the site to advertise\ntheir illegal products, and buyers could create accounts to view and purchase the vendors’\nproducts. Hydra vendors offered a variety of illicit drugs for sale, including cocaine,\nmethamphetamine, LSD, heroin and other opioids. The vendors openly advertised their\ndrugs on Hydra, typically including photographs and a description of the controlled\nsubstance. Buyers rated the sellers and their products on a five-star rating system, and the\nvendors’ ratings and reviews were prominently displayed on the Hydra site.\n\nHydra also featured numerous vendors selling false identification documents. Users could\nsearch for vendors selling their desired type of identification document – for example, U.S.\npassports or drivers’ licenses – and filter or sort by the item’s price. Many vendors of false\nidentification documents offered to customize the documents based on photographs or other\ninformation provided by the buyers.\n\n\n-----\n\nNumerous vendors also sold hacking tools and hacking services through Hydra. Hacking\nvendors commonly offered to illegally access online accounts of the buyer’s choosing. In this\nway, buyers could select their victims and hire professional hackers to gain access to the\nvictims’ communications and take over the victims’ accounts.\n\nHydra vendors also offered a robust array of money laundering and so-called “cash-out”\nservices, which allowed Hydra users to convert their bitcoin (BTC) into a variety of forms of\ncurrency supported by Hydra’s wide array of vendors. In addition, Hydra offered an in-house\nmixing service to launder and then process vendors’ withdrawals. Mixing services allowed\ncustomers, for a fee, to send bitcoin to designated recipients in a manner that was designed\nto conceal the source or owner of the bitcoin. Hydra’s money laundering features were so indemand that some users would set up shell vendor accounts for the express purpose of\nrunning money through Hydra’s bitcoin wallets as a laundering technique.\n\nStarting in or about November 2015, Pavlov is alleged to have operated a company,\nPromservice Ltd., also known as Hosting Company Full Drive, All Wheel Drive and\n4x4host.ru, that administered Hydra’s servers (Promservice). During that time, Pavlov,\nthrough his company Promservice, administered Hydra’s servers, which allowed the market\nto operate as a platform used by thousands of drug dealers and other unlawful vendors to\ndistribute large quantities of illegal drugs and other illicit goods and services to thousands of\nbuyers, and to launder billions of dollars derived from these unlawful transactions.\n\nAs an active administrator in hosting Hydra’s servers, Pavlov allegedly conspired with the\nother operators of Hydra to further the site’s success by providing the critical infrastructure\nthat allowed Hydra to operate and thrive in a competitive darknet market environment. In\ndoing so, Pavlov is alleged to have facilitated Hydra’s activities and allowed Hydra to reap\ncommissions worth millions of dollars generated from the illicit sales conducted through the\nsite.\n\nThe DEA’s Miami Field Division, FBI, IRS-CI, U.S. Postal Inspection Service, and HSI\ninvestigated the case.\n\nThe U.S. investigation was conducted with support and coordination provided by the\nDepartment of Justice’s multi-agency Special Operations Division and the Joint Criminal\nOpioid and Darknet Enforcement (JCODE) Team.\n\nTrial Attorneys C. Alden Pelker and Christen M. Gallagher of the Criminal Division’s\nComputer Crime and Intellectual Property Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Claudia A.\nQuiroz and Robert S. Leach for the Northern District of California are prosecuting the case.\n\nIn addition to the critically important efforts of the German Federal Criminal Police, significant\nassistance was provided by the Justice Department’s Office of International Affairs and the\nU.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia. Assistance was also provided by the\nJustice Department’s National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team.\n\n\n-----\n\n_An indictment is merely an allegation, and the defendant is presumed innocent until proven_\n_guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law._\n\nAttachment(s):\n\n[Download Pavlov Indictment](https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1490906/download)\nTopic(s):\n\nCybercrime\n\nPress Release Number:\n\n22-327\n\n\n-----",
