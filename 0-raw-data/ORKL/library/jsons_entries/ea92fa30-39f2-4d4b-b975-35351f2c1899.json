    "plain_text": "# How to use the Emsisoft Decrypter\n for Philadelphia\n\n**IMPORTANT! Make sure you remove the malware from your system first. Otherwise, it will**\n\n**repeatedly lock your system or encrypt files. Any reliable antivirus solution can do this for you. If**\n\n**your system was compromised through the Windows Remote Desktop feature, we also**\n\n**recommend changing all passwords of all users that are allowed to login remotely and check the**\n\n**local user accounts for additional accounts the attacker might have added.**\n\nThe decrypter requires access to a file pair consisting of one encrypted file and the original, unencrypted\n\nversion of the encrypted file to reconstruct the encryption keys needed to decrypt the rest of your data.\n\nPlease do not change the file names of original and encrypted file, as the decrypter may perform file\n\nname comparisons to determine the correct file extension used for encrypted files on your system.\n\n## How to decrypt your files\n\n1. Download the decrypter from the same site that provided this “How To” document.\n\n2. Once downloaded, select your file pair, and drag and drop it with your mouse onto the\n\ndecrypter executable:\n\n3. Once the mouse key is released, the decrypter will start to reconstruct the required encryption\n\nparameters. Depending on the ransomware, this process can take a significant amount of time:\n\n\n-----\n\n4. The decrypter will display the reconstructed encryption details once the recovery process\n\nfinished. The display is purely informational to confirm that the required encryption details have\nbeen found:\n\n5. The license terms will show up next, which you have to agree to by clicking the “Yes” button:\n\n\n-----\n\n6. Once the license terms are accepted, the primary decrypter user interface opens:\n\n7. By default, the decrypter will pre-populate the locations to decrypt with the currently connected\n\ndrives and network drives. Additional locations can be added using the “Add” button. Also, the\nobject list accepts files and locations to be added via drag and drop.\n\n8. Decrypters typically offer various options depending on the particular malware family. The\n\navailable options are located in the Options tab and can be enabled or disabled there. You can\nfind a detailed list of the available Options below.\n\n\n-----\n\n9. After you added all the locations you want to decrypt to the list, click “Decrypt” to start the\n\ndecryption process. The screen will switch to a status view, informing you about the current\nprocess and decryption status of your files:\n\n10. The decrypter will inform you once the decryption process is finished:\n\n\n-----\n\nIf you require the report for your personal records, you can save it by clicking the “Save log”\nbutton. You can also copy it straight to your clipboard to paste it into emails or forum posts if\nyou are asked to.\n\n## Available decrypter options\n\nThe decrypter currently implements the following options:\n\n  - **Keep encrypted files**\nSince the ransomware does not save any information about the unencrypted files, the decrypter\ncan’t guarantee that the decrypted data is identical to the one that was previously encrypted.\nTherefore, the decrypter by default will opt on the side of caution and not remove any\nencrypted files after they have been decrypted. If you want the decrypter to remove any\nencrypted files after they have been processed, you can disable this option. Doing so may be\nnecessary if your disk space is limited.\n\n\n-----",
