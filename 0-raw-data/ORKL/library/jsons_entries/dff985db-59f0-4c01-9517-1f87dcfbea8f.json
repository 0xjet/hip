The sender claimed it to be a false-positive that inflicts a significant impact on their business.\n\nFigure 1: The email we received from Packity Networks alleged CTO.\n\nAt the time, the file at the link was classified as malicious only by Fortinet and Dr.Web sandbox.\n\nFigure 2: Detections in VirusTotal for setup.exe at the time we received the email.\n\nEven though, at first glance, the request seemed innocent, and almost no other security vendor had flagged the file, we always investigate\nsuch requests thoroughly before complying. Our investigation led to the discovery of a new group we called “Netbounce” and it exposed\ntheir [malware delivery infrastructure. What made this stand out among others is their unique set of tools and techniques. We were able to find](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/malware?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=2021-q1-malware)\nseveral variants developed in-house by this group, each serving a different purpose.\n\nIn this blog post, we’ll present the measures taken by the Netbounce group to make the campaign look as legitimate as possible, and the\nactions FortiGuard Labs took to discover the real intentions of this threat actor.\n\n## The Cover Story\n\nBefore starting to analyze the sample, the first thing to notice is that the link from the email (hxxps://packity.com/setup.exe) had no reference\non the company’s website, including no visible hyperlinks, no mentions of the file or similar names, etc. Moreover, an “official” installer can be\nfound via another URL on the site: hxxps://www.packity.com/pub/desktop/Packity-latest.exe.\n\nAs can be seen in the following table, these installers are entirely different.\n\nFile Name setup.exe packity-latest.exe\n\nProgramming Language GO NSIS installer, deploys NodeJS application\n\n\n-----\n\nFile Size 7MB 40MB\n\nBehaviour No user interaction Installer with UI\n\nTable 1: Key differences between the official installer and setup.exe from the link.\n\nHowever, this alone is not a very solid indicator as there may be legitimate reasons for the discrepancy, such as the installed application\ndownloading and using that setup.exe file later on. Also, the two executables didn’t exhibit any obvious malicious behavior, and both were\nvalidly signed with the same certificate issued to “Secured Network Stack”.\n\nBut the background checks we conducted on Secured Network Stack and Packity Networks Inc. yielded no results; there were no registered\ncompanies or official reference to these entities, nor we could find any employee profiles online. However, based on a twitter\naccount, Packity seems to have had some online presence besides their website for at least two years, and we found reviews for the software.\n\nFigure 3: setup.exe digital signature information from VirusTotal.\n\n### Suspicious Code Signature\n\nEven though the executables were signed with the same certificate, we noticed that the certificate was issued with an unrelated email\naddress, session123@me.com. The certificate was issued on September 2nd 2020, so we searched for older certificates used by Packity\n[and found an older installer. Comparing the older signature confirmed that the contact information is indeed unrelated to the company.](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/99a2ea40cb7823838f0c936f10afad859909b66f673d640e255f0f9c6f075278)\n\nFigure 4: Signature information of the old installer (left) and current (new) Secured Network Stack signatures used to sign the executables.\n\nThe “@me.com” domain only belongs to Apple mail accounts created before September 19th, 2012, as can be seen on the Apple support\nwebsite:\n\nFigure 5: Apple support site addressing the @me.com email domain.\n\nAlthough it may seem odd that a different email was used, the new certificate was issued exactly when the previous certificate expired, on\nSeptember 3rd 2020, which may hint it’s not malicious.\n\nA keen reader may also have noticed that the signature with the new certificate doesn’t have a timestamp countersignature. This is highly\nuncommon when signing code, and the “official” setup file from the website does have a timestamp. Because of this, our suspicions were still\nnot resolved.\n\n### Diving into the Binary\n\nAs mentioned earlier, executing setup.exe did not provide any clear-cut malicious indicators. However, we did observe the following actions:\n\n1. Copied itself to “C:\\Windows\\Net Helper\\net-helper.exe”.\n2. Created a service called “Net Helper” with the copied file.\n3. Started the service and exited the process.\n4. The new service process then attempted to connect to hxxps://update.netbounce.net/check every 5 minutes.\n\nThis behavior is abnormal for an installer, since a) no user interaction occurs, b) new folders are normally not created in C:\\Windows and c) no\nactual files of the program are unpacked and the installer just copies itself.\n\nLooking at the code, we could see it is written in the Go programming language and has a function named equinoxUpdate. According to its\nwebsite, Equinox “helps you build, package and distribute self-updating Go apps to your customers” offers paid hosting plans, and provides an\n[open-source client SDK.](https://github.com/equinox-io/equinox)\n\nFigure 6: Equinox documentation.\n\nIn fact, aside from setting persistency, most of the functionality of the executable is basically the Equinox client using a hardcoded AppId “test”.\nThere were no other references to the equinox namespace, meaning it was used with source code and not just as an imported package, so we\nchecked for any changes made to it. And we found that in addition to the updated URL listed above, the HTTP User-Agent header was set to\n“Netbounce/1.0”.\n\nChanging the URL effectively means the public Equinox servers won’t be used but that by using the same protocol the update mechanism\nmight still appear legitimate.\n\nAt the time of our analysis, the update mechanism did not download anything. However, it's possible the threat actor simply reserved the\noption to use it and deliver malicious payloads in the future.\n\n### Quick Recap\n\n\n-----\n\nt t s stage, e t a oadb oc e e e e a y e d oo g d cato s s etc y co pa y, e ecutab es c ac e e e ces o t e\ncompany’s website, digital signatures with shady attributes, and an application without any substantial functionality. But as suspicious as it\nappeared to be, we didn’t have any concrete proof it was indeed malicious. At this point, we decided to try to find other files that were signed\nusing the same certificate, hoping to get a new lead.\n\n## Revealing the Real Story\n\nWe were able to track down additional samples that shared similar properties to the one we received in the email. Among them, we identified\nsamples compiled for Linux and MacOS, as well as actual malicious capabilities.\n\n[A sample found in the wild under the name “Net Helper GUI.exe” was nearly identical in all properties:](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/d39bf5430c25f74f110514e5b06b62623e0d2bde7edc700098fe930d09144c3d/detection)\n\nFile size: 7MB\nProgramming language: Go\nExecution path: %windir%\\Net Helper\\ net-helper.exe\nFirst seen: 2/14/2021\n\nBindiffing the executable confirmed that both samples have the same author; moreover, it revealed that it has additional functionality:\n\nExact function matches: 5074.\nPartial function matches: 29.\n_Net Helper GUI.exe only functions: 164 (new functionality)._\n_Setup.exe only functions: 34 (none contain real functionality)._\n\nAnalyzing the differences, we observed that the function main_run has additional code on the branch that runs when the service has not yet\nbeen installed. Prior to installing the service, the function “main_setupNetUpdater'' is called to download and execute a next-stage payload via\nan HTTP GET request to boostfever.com. With the URL path and domain are hardcoded, the subdomain is either:\n\n1. A randomly generated UUID - hxxp://0857a813-72ca-4a70-883a-3b555f6bf3c1.boostfever.com/progwrapper.exe\n2. The hardcoded “cdn” string - hxxp://cdn.boostfever.com/progwrapper.exe\n\nWe’ll elaborate on progwrapper.exe in a later section.\n\nFigure 7: Graph view of main_run with the added basic blocks (highlighted).\n\nBefore running the payload, it is also made persistent on the machine via Registry for each time the current user logs on with a new\nsession: HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\net-helper.\n\nWe found such downloaders were contained inside archives and MSI installers. Placing this functionality right after verifying that the service\nisn’t installed makes sense with this possible infection vector as that’s the case when the sample executes on the system for the very first time.\n\nThe Equinox client was used as an imported package, so the namespace is found intact, along with the default URL\n(https://update.equinox.io/check) and User-Agent (EquinoxSDK/1.0). A hardcoded AppId (app_6EE4wBvjBhS) was used across all the\nsamples we detected. After the 5 minutes timer elapses in the service, an update is pulled from the Equinox servers.\n\nThe updated file is another variant of “Net Helper”. It has the modified Equinox client, like in setup.exe, but the AppId is generated using the\nmachine’s serial number. We will refer to these samples as post-update variants.\n\n### Reverse Proxy\n\nAnother functionality incorporated in various samples, pre and post update, is reverse proxy, which effectively grants its operator a foothold\ninside compromised networks while bypassing perimeter firewall policies. Potentially, its purpose may also be to use infected machines as hop\npoints when conducting operations against targets in other organizations.\n\n[This capability was implemented using the open-source Tunnel package. When the service runs, an HTTP GET request is sent to an external](https://github.com/koding/tunnel)\nserver, for instance, hxxp://connect.netbounce.net/manage.json, to obtain the address of the proxy server for inbound communication. Once\nthe sample connects to the specified server, the operator can start proxying HTTP/TCP connections through the compromised machine.\n\nThe name of the package in the compiled binaries is “netbounce” or “proxy”. Off the shelf, the package supports redirecting traffic only on the\nlocal host; in our case, the victim’s machine. The malware authors changed the code to allow them to connect to other machines, per\nspecification.\n\nFigure 8: The disassembly of TCPProxy.Proxy function against the original source code.\n\n### MacOS and Linux Variants\n\nUsing the Go programming language allows the threat actor to easily extend their operations to MacOS and Linux, as it is simple to compile\nthe source code to a different operating system.\n\n\n-----\n\no acOS, e ou d a app cat o pac age t a post sta sc pt t at do oads a p e update a a t t t e sa e a dcoded qu o\nAppId (app_6EE4wBvjBhS). It also includes the reverse proxy functionality with the same management URL\n(hxxp://connect.netbounce.net/manage.json).\n\nFigure 9: The post install script included in the package.\n\nFor post-update samples we observed, there were no additional updates pulled from the netbounce.net domain. Leveraging the fact that the\nEquinox client was used to communicate with this server, we figured out the URLs that serve files in response to valid update requests.\nThrough that, we issued requests on our own and were able to obtain an ELF sample we classified as a post-update variant.\n\n## Program Wrapper\n\nCircling back to the progwrapper.exe executable, we identified it was also developed in Go. It sends an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded\nURL (hxxp://cdn.boostfever.com/ex.json), which returned the following JSON object in response:\n\nFigure 10: ex.json from the response.\n\nDepending on the “type” field, it checks if a file or a registry key does not exist in the provided path and proceeds to download and execute the\nfile from the “download_url”. The function main_downloadAnotherExecutable also exists in “Net Helper GUI.exe”. The code is shared and has\njust one small difference that is not related to the functionality itself.\n\nIn this case, output40.exe is the final payload. It's packed with a multistage packer. Following unpacking, we discovered different stealers being\ndelivered from this infrastructure, such as Vidar and FickerStealer. We observed different variants of the packer, and so we estimate it is a part\nof this delivery infrastructure as well. After unpacking, the payload is executed in memory using reflective loading or Process Hollowing.\n\nIt is interesting to note that FickerStealer’s first action is to create the file “Trackingfolder084\\start.txt”. The string is hardcoded in the binary,\nwhich hints at an intimate relationship between it and the Netbounce infrastructure.\n\nA newer version of progwrapper.exe added a basic remote command execution capability, which can be used instead of the download and\nexecute. This variant also uses a different hardcoded domain, t1.xofinity.com, over HTTPS, and the responses are encrypted with the AES\nalgorithm. Oddly enough, the HTTP User-Agent header is set to “Netbounce/1.0”.\n\n## Connecting the Dots\n\n“Netbounce” is used as a domain name, as a User-Agent, and for custom packages in the source code. Its possible source code is shared by\ndifferent actors; however, overlaps in the network infrastructure makes it possible to cluster all the activity together to one entity.\n\nWHOIS records for installcdn-aws.com, boostfever.com, jumpernode.com, and uptime66.com show they were all registered by the same entity.\n\nThey have the same active subdomains, like cdn, download, update, and proxy. Other subdomains have a similar pattern, where they are\nformatted as “<single char>1”: c1.boostfever.com, u1.boostfever.com, t1.xofinity.com, m1.uptime66.com.\n\nAll IPs for the domains resolve to the same subnet - 195.181.160.0/20. Some servers are also hosted by different domains:\n\n195.181.169.92: dl.installcdn-aws.com, u1.boostfever.com, t1.xofinity.com.\n195.181.164.195: cdn.boostfever.com, cdn.netbounce.net, proxy.netbounce.net, connect.netbounce.net, proxy.jumpernode.com, connect.jum\n\nLooking at passive DNS records, we get some idea for the progression of the campaign over the few last weeks. The following table shows the\nresolution history of domains that pointed to 195.181.164.212, providing another indication that all the domains are operated by the same\nentity.\n\n**Date resolved** **Domain name**\n\n2021-02-23 m1.uptime66.com\n\n2021-02-16 xofinity.com\n\n2021-02-15 p1.boostfever.com\n\nTable 2: DNS resolution history to 195.181.164.212.\n\nWe generated a heat map of infections across the world using FortiGuard threat intelligence data:\n\nFigure 11: Heat map of infected victims by country.\n\n## Summary\n\n\n-----\n\ns e ca pa g as detected a ost ed ate y a te t sta ted, e e t oug t e t eat acto too a ot o easu es to appea as\nlegitimate as possible to evade detection:\n\nUsed a real, even though shady, company to masquerade the activity.\nUsed valid certificates that looked very similar to the original certificates used by the company.\nEmployed a legitimate update service, Equinox, as part of the infection chain.\n\nThe threat actor was convinced that the cover was good enough to send us an email pointing us directly to their executable in an attempt to\ntrick us to whitelist it.\n\nThe initial sample we got is only one part of a rather elaborate, multistage infection mechanism that can be activated at any point in time, with\nthe final payload customized according to the attacker’s discretion.\n\nFigure 12: The infection chain stages.\n\nThe rich and versatile open-source ecosystem of the Go programming language, along with its cross-platform support, surely cut down heavily\non the threat actor’s work time and costs.\n\nAfter we proved this is a part of a malicious campaign, we kept digging and found many additional related samples, and some of the samples\nwere signed with certificates issued to other shady companies.\n\nWe’ll dive into technical details of FickerStealer in a follow up blog.\n\n## Fortinet Protections\n\n**FortiEDR**\n\n[FortiEDR detects and blocks payloads delivery from this infrastructure out-of-the-box without any prior knowledge or special configuration.
