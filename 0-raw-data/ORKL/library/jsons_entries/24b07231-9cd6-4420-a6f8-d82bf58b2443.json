As we have shared\npreviously, we have observed the threat actor using both backdoor and other malware implants to establish sustained access to\naffected networks. As part of our commitment to transparency and intelligence-sharing in the defender community, we continue to\n[update analysis and investigative resources as we discover new tactics and techniques used by the threat actor.](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2020/12/21/december-21st-2020-solorigate-resource-center/)\n\n## Introducing NOBELIUM\n\nMicrosoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) is naming the actor behind the attacks against SolarWinds, the SUNBURST backdoor,\nTEARDROP malware, and related components as NOBELIUM.\n\nRecent investigations have identified three new pieces of malware being used in late-stage activity by NOBELIUM. This blog provides\ndetailed analysis of these malware strains to help defenders detect, protect, and respond to this threat. We continue to partner with\nFireEye to understand these threats and protect our mutual customers. FireEye’s analysis of the malware used by NOBELIUM is\nhere.\n\nMicrosoft discovered these new attacker tools and capabilities in some compromised customer networks and observed them to be in\nuse from August to September 2020. Further analysis has revealed these may have been on compromised systems as early as June\n2020. These tools are new pieces of malware that are unique to this actor. They are tailor-made for specific networks and are\nassessed to be introduced after the actor has gained access through compromised credentials or the SolarWinds binary and after\nmoving laterally with TEARDROP and other hands-on-keyboard actions.\n\n\n-----\n\nThese capabilities differ from previously known NOBELIUM tools and attack patterns, and reiterate the actor s sophistication. In all\nstages of the attack, the actor demonstrated a deep knowledge of software tools, deployments, security software and systems\ncommon in networks, and techniques frequently used by incident response teams. This knowledge is reflected in the actor’s\noperational decisions, from the choice of command-and-control (C2) infrastructure to the naming of scheduled tasks used to maintain\npersistence.\n\nWith this actor’s established pattern of using unique infrastructure and tooling for each target, and the operational value of maintaining\ntheir persistence on compromised networks, it is likely that additional components will be discovered as our investigation into the\nactions of this threat actor continues.\n\n## New NOBELIUM malware\n\nMaintaining persistence is critical for any threat actor after gaining access to a network. In addition to the backdoor in the SolarWinds\nsoftware, NOBELIUM has been observed using stolen credentials to access cloud services like email and storage, as well as\ncompromised identities to gain and maintain access to networks via virtual private networks (VPNs) and remote access tools.\nMicrosoft assesses that the newly surfaced pieces of malware were used by the actor to maintain persistence and perform actions on\nvery specific and targeted networks post-compromise, even evading initial detection during incident response.\n\n## GoldMax\n\nThe GoldMax malware was discovered persisting on networks as a scheduled task impersonating systems management software. In\nthe instances it was encountered, the scheduled task was named after software that existed in the environment, and pointed to a\nsubfolder in ProgramData named after that software, with a similar executable name. The executable, however, was the GoldMax\nimplant.\n\nWritten in Go, GoldMax acts as command-and-control backdoor for the actor. It uses several different techniques to obfuscate its\nactions and evade detection. The malware writes an encrypted configuration file to disk, where the file name and AES-256 cipher\nkeys are unique per implant and based on environmental variables and information about the network where it is running.\n\nGoldMax establishes a secure session key with its C2 and uses that key to securely communicate with the C2, preventing nonGoldMax-initiated connections from receiving and identifying malicious traffic. The C2 can send commands to be launched for various\noperations, including native OS commands, via psuedo-randomly generated cookies. The hardcoded cookies are unique to each\nimplant, appearing to be random strings but mapping to victims and operations on the actor side.\n\nObserved GoldMax C2 domains are high-reputation and high-prevalence, often acquired from domain resellers so that Whois records\nretain the creation date from their previous registration, or domains that may have been compromised. This tactic complements\nNOBELIUM’s operational security strategy as these domains are more likely to be overlooked by security products and analysts\nbased on their perceived long-lived domain ownership. Put simply, several domains we have shared as GoldMax C2 domains are\nonly associated with NOBELIUM after the time they were re-sold or compromised – and Microsoft has provided that indicator context\nwhere it is available to us.\n\nUpon execution, GoldMax retrieves a list of the system’s network interfaces; the malware terminates if it is unable to do so or no\nnetwork interface is configured. It then attempts to determine if any of the network interfaces has the following hardcoded MAC\naddress: c8:27:cc:c2:37:5a. If so, it terminates.\n\n_Figure 1. HardwareAddr.String() call, hardcoded MAC address, and os.Exit() call_\n\n\n-----\n\n### Configuration file\n\nGoldMax is designed to store its configuration data in an encrypted file named features.dat.tmp. The file name varies in different\nversions of GoldMax, but in all observed variants, the configuration file carries a .tmp file extension and is located in the same\ndirectory as GoldMax. The first time GoldMax is run, it uses a set of embedded default values to create and populate its configuration\nfile on disk. The next time GoldMax runs, instead of using its embedded configuration data, it loads the configuration data from its\nconfiguration file stored on the file system.\n\nThe data from the configuration file typically matches the default configuration data embedded in GoldMax, since the embedded data\nwas initially used to create the configuration file. However, GoldMax comes with a command-and-control feature that allows its\noperators to dynamically update its configuration data on the fly. When this happens, GoldMax overwrites the existing data in its\nconfiguration file with the new configuration data received from its operators, so the next time GoldMax is run, it uses the most up-todate version of its configuration data to initialize its runtime settings.\n\nThe configuration data is encrypted using the AES-256 encryption algorithm, CFB encryption mode, and the following cipher key:\n_4naehrkz5alao2jd035zjh3j1v1dvyyc (key varies in different versions of GoldMax). The AES encrypted configuration data is then_\nBase64-encoded using the custom Base64 alphabet\n“ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789-_” before it is stored in the configuration file on the\nfile system. When run, GoldMax decodes (Base64) and decrypts (AES-256) the configuration data to reveal a custom data structure\ncomprised of the following dynamically generated and hardcoded values (delimited by ‘|’):\n\n_Figure 2. Data structure of the GoldMax configuration data_\n\nGoldMax proceeds to parse the data structure depicted above and uses the values within to initialize its runtime settings and variables\nused by its different components.\n\nIf the configuration file is not present on the system, (i.e., the first time it runs), GoldMax uses dynamically generated and embedded\nvalues to create and populate the data structure depicted above. It then uses the same AES encryption methodology to encrypt the\ndata structure. After encrypting the data structure, GoldMax proceeds to Base64 encode the encrypted data structure and removes all\ninstances of ‘=’ from the Base64 encoded string. It then creates a configuration file on the file system (e.g., features.dat.tmp) and\nstores the Base64 encoded data in the configuration file.\n\n### Activation date\n\nGoldMax’s configuration data contains an execution activation/trigger date, stored as an ASCII Unix/Epoch time value as shown in the\nconfiguration data section above, that is essentially meant to function as an “activate after x date/time” feature. After loading its\nconfiguration data, GoldMax checks the current date-time value of the compromised system against the activation date from the\nconfiguration data.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3. Inline Unix() function and EPOCH comparison of the current and activation date/time_\n\nIf an activation date-time value is specified in the configuration data (i.e., not set to ‘0’) and the activation date-time occurs on or\nbefore the current date-time of the compromised system, GoldMax commences its malicious activities. Otherwise, GoldMax\nterminates and continues to do so until the activation date is reached. If no activation date is specified in the configuration data (i.e.,\nfield set to ‘0’), the malware commences its malicious activities straightaway.\n\nIn all versions of GoldMax analyzed during our investigation, the activation date is initially set to ‘0’. However, through its commandand-control feature, the operators can dynamically update the activation date using a specific C2 command, in which case the new\nactivation date is stored in the configuration file and is checked each time GoldMax runs.\n\n### Decoy network traffic\n\nGoldMax is equipped with a decoy network traffic generation feature that allows it to surround its malicious network traffic with\nseemingly benign traffic. This feature is meant to make distinguishing between malicious and benign traffic more challenging. If the\ndecoy network traffic feature is enabled (set to ‘1’ in the configuration data), GoldMax issues a pseudo-random number of decoy\nHTTP GET requests (up to four) for URLs pointing to a mixture of legitimate and C2 domain names and/or IP addresses. The exact\nURL for each request is pseudo-randomly selected from a list of 14 hardcoded URLs. An example URL list comprised of 14 legitimate\nand C2 URLs is shown below:\n\n_Figure 4. Hardcoded URLs from which GoldMax selects up to four to issue HTTP requests for_\n\nAs shown above, some of the decoy URLs point to the domain name of the actual C2 (e.g., onetechcompany[.]com). However, the\nparticular HTTP resources referenced in the URLs above (e.g., style.css, script.js, icon.ico, etc.) are known to the C2 as being decoy\nresources that serve no role in the regular C2 communication between GoldMax and its C2.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Referer value for each decoy HTTP request is also pseudo randomly selected from a list of four legitimate domain names. For\nexample, we have seen the following in various combinations to make up lists of four domains: www[.]mail[.]com, www[.]bing[.]com,\n_www[.]facebook[.]com, www[.]google[.]com, www[.]twitter[.]com, www[.]yahoo[.]com, etc. For demonstration purposes, an example_\ndecoy HTTP GET request is included below (the Connection and User-Agent HTTP headers and their values are manually added to\neach request by GoldMax and remain the same across all decoy HTTP requests, regardless of the destination URL):\n\n_Figure 5. Sample decoy HTTP GET request_\n\n### RSA session key\n\nThe next step in the execution cycle involves establishing a secure session key between GoldMax and its C2 server. GoldMax first\nrequests a session key from its C2 server by sending an HTTP GET request that contains a custom HTTP Cookie value that is unique\nto each implant. The Cookie value is comprised of the following dynamically generated and hardcoded values:\n\n_Figure 6. HTTP Cookie value in HTTP GET request_\n\nAn example request containing the custom Cookie value is shown below:\n\n_Figure 7. Sample HTTP GET request with the custom Cookie value_\n\nThe User-Agent and Connection values above are hardcoded in the HTTP request. The Referer value is pseudo-randomly selected\nfrom a list of four legitimate domain names using various combinations of the following: www[.]mail[.]com, www[.]bing[.]com,\n_www[.]facebook[.]com, www[.]google[.]com, www[.]twitter[.]com, www[.]yahoo[.]com, etc._\n\nIn response to the request above, GoldMax expects to receive an HTTP 200 response containing a very specific and hardcoded\nASCII string (e.g., “uFLa12nFmKkjrmjj”). The seemingly random-looking string is typically 10-16 bytes long (after all leading and\ntrailing white space has been removed). It can best be described as a “shared secret” between the C2 and each individual implant\n(the string varies in different versions of GoldMax). It serves as an acknowledgement that the C2 server has received GoldMax’s\nrequest for a new a session key. If GoldMax does not receive the expected string, it sleeps for a random amount of time and repeats\n(indefinitely) the process described above to obtain the expected string from its C2 server, or until the GoldMax process is terminated.\n\nAfter receiving the expected string, GoldMax sleeps for up to 14 seconds before proceeding. If the decoy traffic option is enabled in\nthe configuration data, GoldMax issues a pseudo-random number of HTTP GET requests (as described under the decoy network\ntraffic section above). GoldMax then issues a new HTTP GET request to its C2 server containing a new set of hardcoded Cookie\nvalues.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8. Sample HTTP GET request showing hardcoded Cookie values_\n\nThe only observed difference between the first and second HTTP GET requests is the value of the second Cookie highlighted above\n(example values: iC0Pf2a48 from the first request vs. J4yeUYKyeuNa2 from the second request above). In response to the request,\nGoldMax receives an encrypted RSA session key (Base64-encoded). Each version of GoldMax contains an RSA private key which\nGoldMax proceeds to decode (using pem.Decode()) and parse (using x509.ParsePKCS1PrivateKey()). GoldMax uses\n_rsa.DecryptOAEP() with the parsed private key to decrypt (using RSA-OAEP) the RSA-encrypted session key received from its C2_\nserver. From this point on, the session key is used to encrypt data sent between GoldMax and its C2 server.\n\n### C2 commands\n\nAfter establishing a session key, GoldMax reaches out to its C2 server to receive, decrypt (AES-256), parse, and execute commands.\nTo retrieve an encrypted C2 command from its C2 server, GoldMax sends an HTTP GET request. This HTTP GET request only\ncontains a single Cookie value, which matches the Cookie value used during the session key establishment process (the User-Agent\nand Connection headers and values are hardcoded, as before):\n\n_Figure 9. Sample HTTP GET request containing a single Cookie value_\n\nIn response to the request above, GoldMax receives an encrypted (AES-256) and encoded (Base64 using custom Base64 alphabet)\nC2 command. The command is encrypted using the session key established between GoldMax and its C2 server. After decoding and\ndecrypting the C2 command, GoldMax proceeds to parse the C2 command.\n\nC2 commands are represented as seemingly random alphanumerical ASCII strings (e.g., “KbwUQrcooAntqNMddu4XRj”) that are\nunique to each implant but known to the C2 server. The C2 commands allow the operator to download and execute files on the\ncompromised system, upload files from the compromised system to the C2 server, execute OS commands on the compromised\nsystem, spawn a command shell, and dynamically update GoldMax’s configuration data. These dynamic updates to Goldmax\nconfiguration data enable ability to set a new activation date, replace the existing C2 URL and User-Agent values, enable/disable\ndecoy network traffic feature, and update the number range used by its PRNG.\n\nIt is worth noting that all observed versions of GoldMax were compiled with the Go compiler version 1.14.2 (released in April 2020). In\nall observed versions, the main Go source code file for GoldMax was located under the following directory: /var/www/html/builds/. The\nGo packages and libraries used during the compilation process of GoldMax were mostly located under the /var/www/html/go/src/\ndirectory (e.g., /var/www/html/go/src/net/http/http.go).\n\n## Sibot\n\n[Sibot is a dual-purpose malware implemented in VBScript. It is designed to achieve persistence on the infected machine then](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/t0aew7h6(v=vs.85))\ndownload and execute a payload from a remote C2 server. The VBScript file is given a name that impersonates legitimate Windows\ntasks and is either stored in the registry of the compromised system or in an obfuscated format on disk. The VBScript is then run via a\nscheduled task.\n\nSibot reaches out to a legitimate but compromised website to download a DLL to a folder under System32. In observed instances the\nDLL is downloaded to C:\\windows\\system32\\drivers\\, renamed with a .sys extension, and then executed by rundll32. The scheduled\ntask calls an MSHTA application to run Sibot via the obfuscated script. This simplistic implementation allows for a low footprint for the\n\n\n-----\n\nactor, as they can download and run new code without changes to the compromised endpoint by just updating the hosted DLL. The\ncompromised website used to host the DLL is different for every compromised network and includes websites of medical device\nmanufacturers and IT service providers.\n\nWe have observed three variants of this malware, all of which are obfuscated:\n\n**Variant A is the simplest of the three. It only installs the second-stage script in the default registry value under the registry key**\n_HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\sibot._\n**Variant B registers a scheduled task named Sibot and programmed to run daily. This task, which is saved by Windows in the file**\n_C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\Microsoft\\Windows\\WindowsUpdate\\sibot, runs the following command-line daily:_\n\nThe registry key referenced in this command-line contains the second-stage script.\n\n**Variant C is a standalone version of the second-stage script. However, while the second-stage script from Variant A is designed**\nto be executed from the registry, this variant is designed to run from a file.\n\n_Figure 10. Sibot variants_\n\n### The second-stage script\n\nThe purpose of the second-stage script is to download and run a payload from a remote server. The script can be customized with the\nfollowing parameters:\n\nCommand-line with which to run the payload\nDirectory where the payload is installed\nURL of the C2 server containing the payload to download\nHTTP request to use for the download (e.g., GET)\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen run, the first thing the script does is to retrieve a GUID associated to a LAN connection present on the machine by leveraging\nthe interface offered by the WMI Class Root\\Microsoft\\Homenet\\HNet_Connection. If a LAN connection is not available, the script\ndefaults to a hardcoded GUID. This GUID is later communicated to the C2. It’s possible that the threat actor used this GUID to verify\nthat the threat is running in a desirable environment, i.e., a real machine with LAN connections available. The next step of the secondstage script is to check if the machine is configured to use proxies, and if so, to get the address of a proxy. The script uses the\nStdRegProv WMI class to read the configuration data from the registry key\n_HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Internet Settings\\ProxyServer and extract a valid proxy server._\n\nAt this point, the script establishes an HTTP connection to the C2 server. It sets the user-agent and the connection GUID as HTTP\nheader variables, then sends the HTTP request. In both versions of the script, the request is GET. If the server response is comprised\nonly of the same GUID that the malware sent, the script deletes itself. In the case of the second-stage script from Variant A, the script\ndeletes the registry key where it is installed. In the case of Variant C, the script deletes the file from which it is running. If instead the\nserver responds with any data other than the GUID, the second-stage script decrypts the data and saves it as a file. In both variants\nof the second-stage script, the payload is a DLL with a .SYS extension and saved in the %windir%\\system32\\drivers folder. Finally,\nthe script uses the Win32_Process WMI class to execute the payload DLL via the rundll32.exe utility.\n\nWhile the script is running in the context of a script host process (e.g. wscript.exe), the actions carried out through the WMI interface\noriginates from the WMI host process (WmiPrvSe.exe). This effectively breaks the process chain between the action’s origin (the\nscript host) and its execution (the WMI host), making it more difficult to trace back events to their true origin. Forensic analysis is also\nhindered by the lack of correlation between the execution of the second-stage script and the events it carries out via WMI.\n\nThe following Python script can be used to decode encoded strings observed in Sibot samples analyzed in this report.\n```\nPython\nencoded = '<ENCODED STRING'\ndecoded = ''\ni = 0\nwhile i < len(encoded):\na = int(chr(ord(encoded[i]) - 17))\ni += 1\nb = int(chr(ord(encoded[i]) - 17))\nif a * 10 + b < 32:\ni += 1\nc = int(chr(ord(encoded[i]) - 17))\ndecoded += chr(a * 100 + b * 10 + c)\nelse:\ndecoded += chr(a * 10 + b)\ni += 1\nprint(decoded)\n\n## GoldFinder\n\n```\nAnother tool written in Go, GoldFinder was most likely used as a custom HTTP tracer tool that logs the route or hops that a packet\ntakes to reach a hardcoded C2 server. When launched, the malware issues an HTTP request for a hardcoded IP address (e.g.,\n_hxxps://185[.]225[.]69[.]69/) and logs the HTTP response to a plaintext log file (e.g., loglog.txt created in the present working_\ndirectory). GoldFinder uses the following hardcoded labels to store the request and response information in the log file:\n\nTarget: The C2 URL\nStatusCode: HTTP response/status code\nHeaders: HTTP response headers and their values\nData: Data from the HTTP response received from the C2\n\nAn example log entry using a sample date is shown below:\n\n_Figure 11. Sample log entry_\n\nIf the response is not an HTTP 200 (OK) response and contains an HTTP Location field (indicating a redirect), GoldFinder recursively\nfollows and logs the redirects until it receives an HTTP 200 response, at which point it terminates. If a Location header is present in\nthe response and the Location value starts with the string “http”, GoldFinder extracts the Location URL (i.e., redirect URL) and issues\n\n\n-----\n\na new HTTP GET request for the redirect URL. It again logs the request and its response in the plaintext log file:\n\n_Figure 12. Sample log file_\n\nIf GoldFinder receives an HTTP 200 status code in response to the request above, indicating no more redirects, it terminates.\nOtherwise, it recursively follows the redirect up to 99 times or until it receives an HTTP 200 response, whichever occurs first.\n\nWhen launched, GoldFinder can identify all HTTP proxy servers and other redirectors such as network security devices that an HTTP\nrequest travels through inside and outside the network to reach the intended C2 server. When used on a compromised device,\nGoldFinder can be used to inform the actor of potential points of discovery or logging of their other actions, such as C2\ncommunication with GoldMax.\n\nGoldFinder was compiled using Go 1.14.2, released in April 2020, from a Go file named finder.go with the following path:\n_/tmp/finder.go. The Go packages and libraries used during the compilation process of GoldFinder were mostly located under the_\n_/var/www/html/go/src/ directory (e.g., /var/www/html/go/src/net/http/http.go)._\n\n## Comprehensive protections for persistent techniques\n\nThe sophisticated NOBELIUM attack requires a comprehensive incident response to identify, investigate, and respond.
