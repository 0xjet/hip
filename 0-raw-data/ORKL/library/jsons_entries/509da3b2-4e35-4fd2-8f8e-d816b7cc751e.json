OpcJacker is an interesting piece of malware, since its\nconfiguration file uses a custom file format to define the stealer’s behavior. Specifically, the\nformat resembles custom virtual machine code, where numeric hexadecimal identifiers\npresent in the configuration file make the stealer run desired functions. The purpose of using\nsuch a design is likely to make understanding and analyzing the malware’s code flow more\ndifficult for researchers.\n\nOpcJacker’s main functions include keylogging, taking screenshots, stealing sensitive data\nfrom browsers, loading additional modules, and replacing cryptocurrency addresses in the\nclipboard for hijacking purposes.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. The OpcJacker infection chain\nWe’ve observed OpcJacker being distributed via different campaigns that involve the\nmalware being disguised as cryptocurrency-related applications and other legitimate\nsoftware, which the threat actors distribute through fake websites. In the latest (February\n2023) campaign involving OpcJacker, the infection chain began with malvertisements that\nwere geofenced to users in Iran. The malvertisements were disguised as a legitimate VPN\nservice that tricked its victims into downloading an archive file containing OpcJacker.\n\nThe malware is loaded by patching a legitimate DLL library within an installed application,\nwhich loads another malicious DLL library. This DLL library then assembles and runs\nshellcode — the loader and runner of another malicious executable — and OpcJacker from\nchunks of data stored in data files of various formats, such as Waveform Audio File Format\n(WAV) and Microsoft Compiled HTML Help (CHM). This loader has been in use for over a\n\n\n-----\n\nyear since it was [previously described and named as the Babadeda crypter. The threat actor](https://blog.morphisec.com/the-babadeda-crypter-targeting-crypto-nft-defi-communities)\nbehind the campaign implemented a few changes in the cryptor itself, then added a\ncompletely new payload (a stealer/clipper/keylogger).\n\nWe noticed that OpcJacker mostly drops (or downloads) and runs additional modules, which\n[are remote access tools — either the NetSupport RAT or a hidden virtual network computing](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.netsupportmanager_rat)\n[(hVNC) variant. We also found a report sharing information on a loader called “Phobos](https://www.malwaretech.com/2015/09/hidden-vnc-for-beginners.html)\nCrypter” (which is actually the same malware as OpcJacker) being used to load the Phobos\nransomware.\n\n## Delivery\n\nAs mentioned in the introduction, we observed OpcJacker being distributed through several\ndifferent campaigns that usually involve fake websites advertising seemingly legitimate\nsoftware and cryptocurrency-related applications, but are actually hosting malware. As these\ncampaigns deliver a few other different malware in addition to OpcJacker, we believe that\nthey are most likely to be different pay-per-install services leveraged by OpcJacker’s\noperators.\n\nIn the latest campaign from February 2023, we noticed OpcJacker being distributed via\nmalvertisements geotargeting Iran. These malvertisements were linked to a malicious\nwebsite disguised as a website for a legitimate VPN software. The site’s content was copied\nfrom the website of a legitimate commercial VPN service — however, the links were modified\nto link to a compromised website hosting malicious content.\n\nThe malicious website checks the client’s IP address to determine whether the victim uses a\nVPN service. If the IP address is not from a VPN service, it then redirects the victim to the\nsecond compromised website to lure them into downloading an archive file containing\nOpcJacker. Note that the attack will not proceed if the intended victim is using a VPN service.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2. An example of a malvertisement designed to deliver OpcJacker\n[Furthermore, we also found a bunch of ISO images and RAR/ZIP archives containing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_disc_image)\nmodified installers of various pieces of software that all lead to the loading of OpcJacker.\nThese installers, which were previously used by other campaigns, were hosted on various\nhacked WordPress-powered websites or software development platforms like GitHub. A\n[possible reason why threat actors favor the use of ISO files is to bypass Mark-of-the-Web](https://redcanary.com/blog/iso-files/)\nwarnings.\n\nThe following are some file name examples we found:\n\nCLF_security.iso\nCloudflare_security_setup.iso\nGoldenDict-1.5.0-RC2-372-gc3ff15f-Install.zip\nMSI_Afterburner.iso\ntigervnc64-winvnc-1.12.0.rar\nTradingViewDesktop.zip\nXDag.x64.rar\n\n## Babadeda crypter\n\nNote that the file names mentioned in this section often change between different installers.\nHowever, their overall functions remain the same.\n\nAfter the installer drops all the necessary files, it then loads the main executable file\n(RawDigger.exe), which is a clean legitimate file.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3. A list of\n\nfiles dropped by the installer; while most of them are clean legitimate files, some are patched\nor malicious files\nThe executable file loads a DLL library that includes patched imports (librawf.dll).\n\nFigure 4.\n\nA list of imported DLL libraries; the highlighted library was patched to load another malicious\nDLL library\nThe patched DLL’s (librawf.dll, which is connected to the legitimate app RawDigger, a raw\nimage analyzer) import address table was further patched to include two additional DLL\nlibraries. In the figure below, notice how the FirstThunk addresses (of the newly added\nlibraries) start with 001Dxxxx instead of the 0012xxxx used in the FirstThunk addresses from\nthe original libraries.\n\nFigure 5.\n\nA patched import address table\n\n\n-----\n\nThe highlighted library in Figure 5 (libpushpp.dll) is then loaded and executed. Its main task\nis to open one of the data files (hm) and load the first stage shellcode stored inside.\n\nFigure 6. Malicious library\n\nopening a data file\nThe offset and size of the first stage shellcode is hardcoded into the DLL library.\n\nFigure 7. Malicious\n\nlibrary copying the first stage shellcode from offset 0x37D50; the size of the shellcode is\n0x75A bytes\nIn newer versions of the Babadeda crypter, another DLL library (mdb.dll, from the fake VPN\ninstaller) is loaded into memory, after which a hardcoded, randomly selected block of\nmemory is overwritten with the first stage shellcode. Note that this change is just a small\ndetail and has no influence on the first stage shellcode’s overall function.\n\nFigure 8. The legitimate\n\nlibrary (mdb.dll) is loaded into memory, after which the first stage shellcode (0x7B5 bytes) is\ncopied into the library’s memory space\nThere is a configuration table containing offsets of encrypted chunks followed by their\nrespective sizes at the end of the first stage shellcode. The first stage shellcode then\ndecrypts and combines all chunks to form the second stage shellcode (a loader) and the\nmain malware (OpcJacker with the ability to load additional malicious modules).\n\nFigure 9.\n\nConfiguration table of the first stage shellcode\nThe configuration table starts with at least eight of the same characters (the red colored “*” in\nFigure 9, but different characters may be used in other samples), followed by the total length\nof the data file (green color; length of hm = 0x1775e0 = 1537504 bytes), the encryption key\n(yellow color; 0x18), the number of chunks in the second stage of the shellcode (brown color;\n\n\n-----\n\n0x07), and finally, by the number of chunks in the main malware (white color; 0x08). The list\nof 0x07 (red bracket) and 0x08 (blue bracket) is equivalent to fifteen addresses and sizes of\neach chunk.\n\nAt the beginning of the data file (hm), we can see the [(WAV) file header as it tries to mimic a](https://docs.fileformat.com/audio/wav/)\n[WAVE file format. Note that the data file can be a different file format, since we also observed](https://docs.fileformat.com/audio/wav/)\nCHM being used.\n\nFigure 10. Data file that starts with a WAV header\nMain stealer component (OpcJacker)\n\nThe main malware component (OpcJacker) is an interesting stealer that first decrypts and\nloads its configuration file. The configuration file format resembles a bytecode written in a\ncustom machine language, where each instruction is parsed, individual opcodes are\nobtained, and then the specific handler is executed.\n\nWhen analyzing the custom bytecode, we noticed the following patterns:\n\nASCII strings were encoded as 01 xx xx xx xx <string bytes>; where xx xx xx xx is the length\nof the string.\n\nFigure 11.\nEncoded ASCII string inside the configuration file\nSimilarly, [wide character strings started with byte 02, while binary arrays started with byte 03.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_character)\n\nFigure 12.\n\nEncoded UNICODE string inside the configuration file\n\nFigure 13.\n\nEncoded binary array inside the configuration file\nThe configuration file format is a sequence of instructions where instruction starts with three\n4-byte little-endian (DWORD) numbers. The first number is the virtual program counter, the\nsecond is likely the parent instruction’s virtual program counter, while the third is the handler\nID (code to be executed in the virtual machine), followed by data bytes or additional handler\nIDs.\n\nBased on these observations, we wrote an instruction parser, from which we were presented\nwith the following output. Although our observations and understanding of the virtual\nmachine’s internal implementation was incomplete, the parser gave us a good understanding\n\n\n-----\n\nof what behavior was defined in the configuration file.\n\nThe decrypted and decoded configuration file starts with the initialization of certain system\nvariables, with “test” and “rik” likely being campaign IDs. The configuration file dropped by\nSHA256 c5b499e886d8e86d0d85d0f73bc760516e7476442d3def2feeade417926f04a5\ncontains different keywords “test” and “ilk” as campaign IDs. Meanwhile, the configuration file\ndropped by the latest campaign from February 2023 (SHA256\n565EA7469F9769DD05C925A3F3EF9A2F9756FF1F35FD154107786BFC63703B52)\ncontains the keywords “test_installs” and “yorik.”\n\nFigure 14. Initialization\n\ncommands\nThen initialization of clipboard replacement functionality (clipping) follows.\n\nFigure 15. Clipboard replacer (clipper) initialization\nLater, the variable “exe” is initialized with executable file bytes (see the 4d 5a 90 = MZ\nmarker). This executable is a remote access tool.\n\nFigure 16. The embedded module (PE EXE format)\nThe malware sets up persistence via registry run and task scheduler methods. Note the\n_$itself_exe variable used for holding the file name of the current process._\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 17. Method for setting persistence\nThe malware then starts the clipper function, that is, it monitors the clipboard for\ncryptocurrency addresses and replaces them with its own cryptocurrency addresses\ncontrolled by the attackers.\n\nFigure 18. The clipper function\nFinally, the virtual_launch_exe function runs the previously embedded executable, which we\nobserved to be RATs, either the NetSupport RAT, the NetSupport RAT downloader, or hVNC.\n\nFigure 19. Function to run the embedded executable file\n\n\n-----\n\n## Handler IDs in custom virtual machines\n\nAs can be observed in the third column (or decoded “command” variable) in a few of the\nprevious screenshots, the virtual machine implements numerous internal handlers. Most of\nthese are related to various data manipulations. We list a few of the notable handlers that\nhave specific high-level functionalities in Table 1. The functions the stealer implements\ninclude the following: clipping (clipboard content replacement), keylogging, file execution and\nlisting, killing processes, stealing chromium credentials, detecting idleness, and detecting\nvirtual machines. However, during our testing scenarios, we observed the stealer mostly just\nsets the persistence and delivers additional modules (remote access tools).\n\n**Handler ID** **Function**\n\n0x3E9 Used for persistence (registry; HKCU)\n\n0x3EA Used for persistence (registry; HKLM)\n\n0x3EB Used for persistence (startup folder)\n\n0x3EC;0x3ED Used for persistence (task scheduler)\n\n0x7d1 Lists files\n\n0x579 Starts clipper\n\n0x57A Stops clipper\n\n0x12d Puts the machine into sleep mode\n\n0x385 Terminates process\n\n0x387 Exits process\n\n0x388; 0x38B Runs PE executable\n\n0x389 Runs shellcode\n\n0x38A Runs PE executable export routine\n\n0x76D Gets current committed memory limit (ullTotalPageFile)\n\n0x76E Gets the amount of actual physical memory (ullTotalPhys)\n\n0x641 Steals sensitive data from Chromium\n\n0x259 Checks if the machine is idle and if the cursor is not moving\n\n0x25B Checks if the machine is idle and if no new process is being created\n\n0x25D Checks if the machine idle and if no new window is being created\n\n\n-----\n\n0x835 Starts keylogger\n\n0x836 Starts keylogger for a certain period\n\n0x837 Stops keylogger\n\n0x839 Copies data (likely logs) then return 0x83a (klogs)\n\n0x1F5 Retrieves VMWare via CPUID\n\n0x1f7 Searches for 'virtual' in SYSTEM\\\\ControlSet001\\\\Services\\\\disk\\\\Enum\n\n0x83A Writes file(s) to klogs//\n\n0x89a Writes file(s) to screenshots\\\\\n\n0x596 Writes to clp\\clp_log.txt\n\n0xf6 Writes file(s) to chromium_creds\\\\\n\n0xCE Copies files to filesystem\\\\\n\n0x321 Creates messagemonitor window, which needed for the clipper\n\n0x322 Destroys messagemonitor window, which is needed for the clipper\n\n0x5DC Gets environment ID\n\n0x5E0 Runs GetModuleFileNameW, which is needed for resolving $itself_exe\n\nTable 1.

This single file is not enough, however, as the NetSupport tool\nneeds additional DLL libraries and a configuration file. Note that these missing files have\nalready been dropped by the modified installer into the installation directory.\n\nFor researchers, the most important file is called client32.ini, which contains important\nsettings such as gateway addresses, gateway keys (GSK), and ports.\n\nFigure 21.

Code generating hVNC packet\n\nmagic\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIt seems that OpcJacker’s operator is motivated by financial gain, since the malware’s\nprimary purpose is stealing cryptocurrency funds from wallets. However, its versatile\nfunctions also allow OpcJacker to act as an information stealer or a malware loader, meaning\nit can be used beyond its initial intended use.\n\nThe campaign IDs we found in the samples, such as “test” and “test_installs”, indicate that\nOpcJacker could still be under development and testing stages. Given its unique design\ncombined with a variety of VM-like functionalities, it’s possible that the malware could prove\nto be popular with threat actors, and therefore could see use in future threat campaigns.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n[The indicators for this blog entry can be found here.](https://www.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/research/23/c/new-opcjacker-malware-distributed-via-fake-vpn-malvertising/ioc-new-opcJacker-malware-distributed-via-fake-vpn-malvertising.txt)\n\n\n-----",
