Normally, third party software would be disabled on a\ncomputer that had been rebooted into Safe Mode, but these attackers clearly intended to\ncontinue to remotely access and control the targeted machines unimpeded.\n\n\n-----\n\nAvos Locker deployment tools were stored in a backup server under a directory named a.\nAttackers run the files remotely, so they’re never written to the filesystem of the targeted\nmachines.\nIt isn’t clear whether a machine that had been set up in this way – with AnyDesk set to run\nunder Safe Mode – would even be remotely manageable by its legitimate owner. The\noperator of the machine might need to physically interact with the computer in order to\nmanage it.\n\n[In some instances we’ve also seen the attackers employ a tool called Chisel, which creates a](https://github.com/jpillora/chisel)\ntunnel over HTTP, with the data encrypted using SSH, that the attackers can use as an\nsecure back channel to the infected machine.\n\nThere are also other indications that, in some of the attacks, there had been lateral\nmovement and other indicators of malicious behavior which were saved in the Event Logs of\nsome machines.\n\nFor example, this batch file was created on the same machine were it was run, just prior to\nthe attack.\n\n\n-----\n\nAnd in this case, there’s an Event Log entry that shows a base64-encoded PowerShell script\nbeing executed, with the results being output to a file called execute.bat, which is then run,\nand finally deleted.\n\nIn another Event Log entry, there’s a record of a port being set up as a proxy on the targeted\nmachine, which would theoretically help the attackers conceal any lateral movement by\nrouting all commands through the proxy computer.\n\nWe’re also investigating the use by Avos of a Linux ransomware component that targets\nVMware ESXi hypervisor servers by killing any virtual machines, then encrypting the VM\nfiles. The above command was used to iterate and terminate any virtual machines that were\nrunning on the hypervisor. It still isn’t clear how the attackers obtained the administrator’s\ncredentials needed to enable the ESX Shell or access the server itself.\n\n## Deploy like an IT pro\n\nThe attackers also appear to have leveraged another commercial IT management tool\nknown as PDQ Deploy to push out Windows batch scripts to machines they planned to\ntarget. Sophos Rapid Response has created a chart that highlights the consequences of one\nof these batch files running. The batch files are run before the computer is rebooted into Safe\nMode.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nThese batch scripts orchestrate stages of the attacks and lay the groundwork for the final\nphase in which the threat actors deploy the Avos Locker ransomware. One of the batch\nscripts we recovered was called Love.bat (shown above), which was pushed out to\nmachines on the network by the PDQDeployRunner service. We also saw batch files named\n**update.bat or lock.bat with small variations in them.**\n\nThese orchestration scripts modified or deleted Registry keys that effectively sabotaged the\nservices or processes belonging to specific endpoint security tools, including the built-in\nWindows Defender and third party software from companies such as Kaspersky, Carbon\nBlack, Trend Micro, Symantec, Bitdefender, and Cylance. The script disables Windows\nUpdate and attempts to disable Sophos services, but the tamper protection feature prevents\nthe batch script from succeeding.\n\nThe attackers also used the batch script to create a new user account on the infected\nmachine (newadmin) and give it a password (password123456), and add it to the\nAdministrators user group. They then set the machine to automatically log in when it reboots\ninto Safe Mode. The attackers also disable certain registry keys used by some networks to\ndisplay a “legal notice” upon login. Disabling these features reduces the chance that the\nautomatic login will fail because a dialog box waiting for a human to click it is holding up the\nprocess.\n\nThe Avos Locker batch script, recovered from a target’s network\nThe penultimate step in the infection process is the creation of a “RunOnce” key in the\nRegistry that executes the ransomware payload, filelessly, from where the attackers have\nplaced it on the Domain Controller. This is a similar behavior to what we’ve seen IcedID and\n\n\n-----\n\nother ransomware do as a method of executing malware payloads without letting the files\never touch the filesystem of the infected computer.\n\nAvos Locker’s final set of commands before a reboot\nThe final step in the batch script is to set the machine to reboot in Safe Mode With\nNetworking, and to disable any warning messages or ignore failures on startup. Then the\nscript executes a command to reboot the box, and the infection is off to the races. If for\nwhatever reason the ransomware doesn’t run, the attacker can use AnyDesk to remotely\naccess the machine in question and try again manually.\n\n## Guidance and detection\n\nWorking in Safe Mode makes the job of protecting computers all the more difficult, because\nMicrosoft does not permit endpoint security tools to run in Safe Mode. That said, Sophos\nproducts behaviorally detect the use of various Run and RunOnce Registry keys to do things\nlike reboot into Safe Mode or execute files after a reboot. We have been refining these\ndetections to reduce false positives, as there are many completely legitimate tools and\nsoftware which use these Registry keys for normal operations.\n\nRansomware, especially when it has been hand-delivered (as has been the case in these\nAvos Locker instances), is a tricky problem to solve because one needs to deal not only with\nthe ransomware itself, but with any mechanisms the threat actors have set up as a back door\ninto the targeted network. No alert should be treated as “low priority” in these circumstances,\nno matter how benign it might seem. The key message for IT security teams facing such an\nattack is that even if the ransomware fails to run, until every trace of the attackers’\n**AnyDesk deployment is gone from every impacted machine, the targets will remain**\n**vulnerable to repeated attempts. In these cases, where the Avos Locker attackers set up**\naccess to their organization’s network using AnyDesk, the attackers can lock out the\ndefenders or run additional attacks at any time as long as the attackers’ remote access tools\nremain installed and functional.\n\nVarious activities by the threat actors were detected (and blocked) by the behavioral\ndetection rules Exec_6a and Exec_15a. Intercept X telemetry showed that the CryptoGuard\nprotection mechanism was invoked when the ransomware attackers tried to run their\nexecutable. Sophos products will also detect the presence of Chisel (PUA), PSExec (PUA),\nand PSKill (PUA), but may not automatically block these files, depending on the local\npolicies set up by the Sophos admin.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\n\n-----\n\nSophosLabs and Rapid Response gratefully acknowledges the assistance of Fraser Howard,\nAnand Ajjan, Peter Mackenzie, Ferenc László Nagy, Sergio Bestulic, and Timothy Easton for\ntheir help with analysis and threat response.\n\n\n-----",
