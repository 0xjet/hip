The conglomerate, which has been linked to Iran’s Ministry of Intelligence and\nSecurity by the [U.S. Cyber Command, has been now identified as multiple different](https://www.cybercom.mil/Media/News/Article/2897570/iranian-intel-cyber-suite-of-malware-uses-open-source-tools/)\nsubgroups acting under the name of MuddyWater rather than one unified threat actor.\n\n## How and when the cyberattacks happened\n\nThe hacker group has reportedly been targeting these countries using a Windows script file\n(WSF) based remote access trojan (RAT) deemed “SloughRAT” by Cisco Talos. Using this\nform of malware, MuddyWater has attempted to conduct espionage, steal intellectual\nproperty and commit ransomware attacks against countries in the Arabian Peninsula the\ngroup has zeroed in on. The malicious actors attempted two campaigns against Turkey in\nNovember 2021, and targeted Armenia in June of the same year using the same types of\nWindows executable files.\n\nIn April 2021, Cisco Talos observed that this group also launched an attack against Pakistan\nvia two different delivery systems – one employing a PowerShell-based downloader to\naccept and execute additional PS1 commands from the C2 server and another using\n\n\n-----\n\nmalware document infection point that claimed to be part of a court case in Pakistan.\n\nThe group, also known as “MERCURY” or “Static Kitten”, has been active since at least\n2017, and is known for utilizing ransomware in their previously attempted attacks. According\nto the cybersecurity firm, the threat group has been known to use domain name system\n(DNS) attacks on its intended victims by using “PowerShell, Visual Basic and JavaScript\nscripting along with living-off-the-land binaries (LoLBins) and remote connection utilities to\nassist in the initial stages of the infection.”\n\n**SEE:** **[Google Chrome: Security and UI tips you need to know (TechRepublic Premium)](https://www.techrepublic.com/resource-library/downloads/google-chrome-security-and-ui-tips-you-need-to-know/?r=45645463)**\n\n## MuddyWater as a collection of groups\n\nCredit: Cisco Talos\n\n\n-----\n\nAccording to Cisco Talos findings, the hacking group s Variety of lures and payloads —\nalong with the targeting of several different geographic regions — strengthens our growing\nhypothesis that MuddyWater is a conglomerate of sub-groups rather than a single actor.”\n\nThe cybersecurity firm believes that the hacking group is a combination of smaller teams,\ntargeting specific regions such as the Arabian Peninsula and Asia utilizing the different types\nof attacking techniques above. While MuddyWater is incorporated by smaller sub-groups,\nCisco Talos believes that some of these teams are contracted out for attacks by the leaders\nand organizers of MuddyWater. One reason for this belief is that there have been unique\nstrings and watermarks identified as being shared between MuddyWater and the\nPhosphorus/Charming Kitten APT groups.\n\nThese shared techniques among these smaller teams are seemingly preferred by threat\nactors in certain regions, making them identifiable as not belonging to the same areas as\nother attacks by the collective. The two preferred methods of attacks highlighted by the\ncybersecurity firm were the SloughRAT Windows executable file, and the Ligolo reverse\ntunneling tool which was used against Middle Eastern countries in March 2021.\n\n**SEE:** **[Password breach: Why pop culture and passwords don’t mix (free PDF)](https://www.techrepublic.com/resource-library/whitepapers/password-breach-why-pop-culture-and-passwords-don-t-mix-free-pdf/)**\n**(TechRepublic)**\n\n## How to secure yourself and your business\n\nWhile this hacker group has been specifically targeting regions and countries throughout the\nworld, cyber threats remain an important thing to keep in mind for both individuals and\n[organizations. With this in mind, it is important to be ready with both antivirus software and](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/best-antivirus-software/)\nextremely thorough training to make sure that systems have not been compromised and\nemployees are aware of the online risks to avoid being victimized.\n\n### Cybersecurity Insider Newsletter\n\nStrengthen your organization's IT security defenses by keeping abreast of the latest\ncybersecurity news, solutions, and best practices.\n\n\n-----\n\nDelivered Tuesdays and Thursdays\n\n## Account Information\n\n Share with Your Friends\n\nMuddyWater targets Middle Eastern and Asian countries in phishing attacks\n\nYour email has been sent\n\nShare: MuddyWater targets Middle Eastern and Asian countries in phishing attacks\n\n[Security](https://www.techrepublic.com/topic/security/)\n\n## Editor's Picks\n\nImage: Andy Wolber\n\nSoftware\n### Best cloud backup services and solutions 2022\n\nThese 11 cloud-to-cloud solutions back up your organization’s data so you’ll be covered\nin the event of deletions, malware or outages.
