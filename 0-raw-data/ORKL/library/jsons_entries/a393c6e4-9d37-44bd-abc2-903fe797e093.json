This malspam is pretending to photos being\nsent to the recipient and will have a subject line that starts in a similar way to \"Emailing:\nIMG_20171221_\".\n\n**GlobeImposter MalSpam**\n\nThese malspam emails contain7zip (.7z) archive attachments that are named after a camera\nphoto's filename such as IMG_[date]_[number]. These 7z files contain a obfuscated .js file\nthat when double-clicked on will cause the GlobeImposter ransomware to be downloaded\nfrom a remote site and executed.\n\nAn example of this JS installer can be seen below.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Obfuscated JS Installer**\n\nAfter the executable is downloaded, it will be executed and the GlobeImposter ransomware\nwill begin to encrypt the computer. When encrypting files on the computer it will append the\n..doc extension to encrypted file's name. For example, a file called 1.doc would be renamed\nto 1.doc..doc.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Encrypted Folder**\n\nWhen GlobeImposter encrypts files it will also create a ransom note named\n**Read___ME.html in each folder a file is encrypted.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Ransom Note**\n\nThis ransom note contains instructions to use Tor to go to the\nhttp://n224ezvhg4sgyamb.onion/sup.php onion site. This site then tells you to contact them\nto receive payment instructions and to decrypt one file for free. It also lists the email\nserver5@mailfence.com as a way to contact them.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Tor Payment Site**\n\nIt also contains a link to a support site where you can send them a message.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Tor Support Site**\n\nUnfortunately, at this time there is no way to decrypt GlobeImposter files for free. For\nsupport or help with this ransomware infection, you can ask in our dedicated GlobeImposter\nRansomware Support topic.\n\n## How to protect yourself from the GlobeImposter Ransomware\n\nIn order to protect yourself from the GlobeImposter Ransomware you should use standard\nsecurity practices. This includes using good computing habits and security software. First\nand foremost, you should always have a reliable and tested backup of your data that can be\nrestored in the case of an emergency, such as a ransomware attack.\n\nYou should also have security software that incorporates behavioral detections to combat\nransomware and not just signature detections or heuristics. For example, Emsisoft Anti[Malware and Malwarebytes Anti-Malware both contain behavioral detection that can prevent](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/malwarebytes-anti-malware/)\nmany, if not most, ransomware infections from encrypting a computer.\n\nLast, but not least, make sure you practice the following security habits, which in many cases\nare the most important steps of all:\n\n\n-----\n\nBackup, Backup, Backup!\nDo not open attachments if you do not know who sent them.\nDo not open attachments until you confirm that the person actually sent you them.\n[Enable the showing of file extensions.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/how-to-show-file-extensions-in-windows/)\nIf an attachment ends with .js, .vbs, .exe, .scr, or .bat, do not open them for any reason.\n[Scan attachments with tools like VirusTotal.](https://www.virustotal.com/#/home/upload)\nMake sure all Windows updates are installed as soon as they come out! Also make sure\nyou update all programs, especially Java, Flash, and Adobe Reader. Older programs\ncontain security vulnerabilities that are commonly exploited by malware distributors.\nTherefore it is important to keep them updated.\nMake sure you use have some sort of security software installed that uses behavioral\ndetections or white list technology. White listing can be a pain to train, but if your\nwilling to stock with it, could have the biggest payoffs.\nUse hard passwords and never reuse the same password at multiple sites.\n\nFor a complete guide on ransomware protection, you visit our How to Protect and Harden a\nComputer against Ransomware article.\n\n[A big thanks to Eric Taylor of IT-Simplified for pointing out the malspam campaign.](https://twitter.com/ITSimplifie)\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[New ‘Cheers’ Linux ransomware targets VMware ESXi servers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-cheers-linux-ransomware-targets-vmware-esxi-servers/)\n\n[SpiceJet airline passengers stranded after ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/spicejet-airline-passengers-stranded-after-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[US Senate: Govt’s ransomware fight hindered by limited reporting](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-senate-govt-s-ransomware-fight-hindered-by-limited-reporting/)\n\n[New RansomHouse group sets up extortion market, adds first victims](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-ransomhouse-group-sets-up-extortion-market-adds-first-victims/)\n\n[Ransomware attack exposes data of 500,000 Chicago students](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-attack-exposes-data-of-500-000-chicago-students/)\n\n## IOCs\n\n### Doc GlobeImposter Variant Hashes:\n```\nSHA256: 15e8c986c4602c61a474b51d250e03d5bb178eabc8c5a82a242c1a0fa2227704\n\n Doc GlobeImposter Variant Associated Files:\nRead___ME.html\n\n Doc GlobeImposter Variant Network Connections:\nhttp://n224ezvhg4sgyamb.onion/sup.php\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n### Doc GlobeImposter Variant Email addresses:\n```\nserver5@mailfence.com\n\n Doc GlobeImposter Variant Ransom Note:\nYour files are Encrypted!\nFor data recovery needs decryptor.\nIf you want to buy a decryptor click \"Buy Decryptor\"\nBuy Decryptor\nIf not working, click again. \nFree decryption as guarantee.\nBefore paying you can send us 1 file for free decryption.\nIf you can not contact, follow these two steps:\n1.
