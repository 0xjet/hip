This time by Netwalker, who is asking a $14 million ransom for the\ndecryption key and to not release several terabytes of stolen data.\n\nEnel is one of the largest players in the European energy sector, with more than 61 million\ncustomers in 40 countries. As of August 10, it ranks 87 in Fortune Global 500, with a\nrevenue of almost $90 billion in 2019.\n\n## Enel hit with Netwalker Ransomware attack\n\n[In early June, Enel's internal network was attacked by Snake ransomware, also referred to](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/power-company-enel-group-suffers-snake-ransomware-attack/)\nas EKANS, but the attempt was caught before the malware could spread.\n\n\n-----\n\nOn Octber 19th, a researcher shared a Netwalker ransom note with BleepingComputer that\nappeared to be from an attack on Enel Group.\n\n**Netwalker ransom note for Enel Group**\nIncluded in the ransom note, was a link to a http://prnt.sc/ URL that showed data stolen\nfrom the attack. Based on the names of the employees in the folders, it was determined that\nthe attack was on Enel Group.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Screenshot of stolen data shared in ransom note**\nBleepingComputer emailed Enel Group last week regarding the attack but never heard\nback.\n\nA few days later, Netwalker confirmed that the victim was Enel Group after they added a\nmessage to their support chat, stating \"Hello Enel. Dont be afraid to write us.\"\n\n\n-----\n\n**Netwalker chat section for Enel victim page**\nTypically, if the company does not engage the ransom operator in any way, the ransom\ndoubles after a while. It appears that this is what happened with Enel, too, as the private\nchat provided by the attacker has no conversation from the company.\n\nThe attacker used this channel to announce that they would initiate the first step towards\nleaking the stolen data. This means publishing proof that they have the goods, an attempt\nto pressure the company into paying the ransom, which is now $14 million (1234.02380000\nBTC).\n\n\n-----\n\n**$14,000,000 million ransom demand**\nToday, the Netwalker ransomware gang added Enel Group to their data leak site and\nshared screenshots of unencrypted files from the company during this month's cyberattack.\n\n\n-----\n\nAccording to Netwalker, they stole about 5 terabytes of data from Enel and are ready to\nmake public a piece of it in a week. They also said they would \"analyze every file for\ninteresting things\" and publish it on their leak site.\n\nThis tactic is meant to add pressure and force payment from the victim company. In many\ncases, this works to the advantage of the attacker.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware asks $5 million to unlock Austrian state](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/blackcat-alphv-ransomware-asks-5-million-to-unlock-austrian-state/)\n\n[Windows 11 KB5014019 breaks Trend Micro ransomware protection](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-11-kb5014019-breaks-trend-micro-ransomware-protection/)\n\n[Industrial Spy data extortion market gets into the ransomware game](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/industrial-spy-data-extortion-market-gets-into-the-ransomware-game/)\n\n[New ‘Cheers’ Linux ransomware targets VMware ESXi servers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-cheers-linux-ransomware-targets-vmware-esxi-servers/)\n\n[SpiceJet airline passengers stranded after ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/spicejet-airline-passengers-stranded-after-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[Netwalker](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/netwalker/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n\n[Ionut Ilascu](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/ionut-ilascu/)\n\nIonut Ilascu is a technology writer with a focus on all things cybersecurity.
