For the first time, this report\nshows how these expectations have now become a reality, detailing a Russian criminal\norganization we call Cosmic Lynx.\n\nWe have observed more than 200 BEC campaigns linked to Cosmic Lynx since July\n2019, targeting individuals in 46 countries on six continents. Unlike most BEC groups that\nare relatively target agnostic, Cosmic Lynx has a clear target profile: large, multinational\norganizations. Nearly all of the organizations Cosmic Lynx has targeted have a significant global\npresence and many of them are Fortune 500 or Global 2000 companies. The target employees\nof Cosmic Lynx are senior-level executives. Like other BEC groups, it seems Cosmic Lynx\nidentifies employees to target based on their title. Three quarters of employees targeted by\nCosmic Lynx hold the titles of Vice President, General Manager, or Managing Director.\n\n\nCosmic Lynx employs a dual impersonation scheme. The pretext of their attacks is that the\ntarget organization is preparing to close an acquisition with an Asian company as part of a\ncorporate expansion. First, they impersonate a company’s CEO, asking the target employee to\nwork with “external legal counsel” to coordinate the payments needed to close the acquisition.\nThen, Cosmic Lynx hijacks the identity of a legitimate attorney at a UK-based law firm whose\njob it is to facilitate the transaction. Cosmic Lynx prefers to use mule accounts in Hong Kong to\nreceive stolen funds. The group is actively resistant to using mule accounts in the United States,\nbut has provided secondary accounts located in Hungary, Portugal, and Romania.\n\nCosmic Lynx exploits DMARC controls to spoof the email addresses of impersonated CEOs,\nmaking their attacks appear much more authentic. For organizations that have implemented an\nestablished DMARC policy set to reject (p=reject) or quarantine (p=quarantine), Cosmic Lynx\nmodifies the display name impersonating a CEO to include their email address, which still gives\nit the look that the email is coming from the CEO’s account.\n\nDomains registered by Cosmic Lynx are named in a way to mimic secure email and network\ninfrastructure (e.g., secure-mail-gateway[.]cc, encrypted-smtp-transport[.]cc, mx-secure-net[.]\ncom). The mailbox referenced in a Cosmic Lynx email address usually references celestial\nbodies, like planets and stars--hence the “Cosmic” in Cosmic Lynx-- similar to the naming\nconvention of some SMTP or DNS name servers.\n\nTo make their infrastructure more resilient and mask their identity in Whois records, Cosmic\nLynx has registered a number of their domains with NiceVPS, a bulletproof hosting and\nanonymous domain provider. Cosmic Lynx’s infrastructure has also been linked to other types\nof malicious activity, including Emotet and Trickbot banking Trojans, Android click fraud\nf\n\n\ncom).

In doing so,\nwe collect rich intelligence that allows us to better understand cybercriminal group operations,\nuncover the identities of those involved in the criminal schemes, discover and track the\nevolution of their methods over time, and unravel the financial infrastructure they use to launder\nstolen proceeds.\n\nOver the last year, ACID has identified more than 200 BEC campaigns targeting businesses\nall over the world that are attributed to a sophisticated group of BEC actors we refer to as\n“Cosmic Lynx.” This report details the tactics used by the group as well as our assessment\nabout the attribution of the group’s location.\n\nThe pretext used in nearly all Cosmic Lynx BEC attacks is that the company is preparing to\nclose an acquisition with an Asian company as part of corporate expansion. Impersonating the\ncompany’s CEO, Cosmic Lynx asks the target employee to work with “external legal counsel”\nto coordinate the payments necessary to close the acquisition. Of course, due to the sensitive\nnature of this acquisition, the target employee is asked to keep the details of this transaction\nconfidential until it has been finalized.\n\n\n-----\n\nOne of the first things that stands out in a Cosmic Lynx attack is that they are extremely wellwritten. Unlike most BEC emails that are riddled with misspelled words and grammatical errors,\nCosmic Lynx emails are usually very detailed and written in nearly perfect English. In some\ncases, Cosmic Lynx uses words that are likely not in most people’s vocabulary, like “accretive”\nand “synergistic,” and uses them in their proper context. It should be noted that although\nCosmic Lynx’s targets are located all over the world, nearly all of the emails sent by the group\nare written in English. The only exception to this we have identified were a handful of emails\nwritten in French that were sent to a few targets in France.\n\nOnce the “CEO” has introduced the request to the target employee, the next step in a Cosmic\nLynx attack is to introduce the “lawyer” that will be assisting with the payments for the fake\nacquisition. The “lawyer” generally introduces himself in a separate email and gives the target a\ngeneral overview of how the transaction will proceed.\n\n\nimpersonated by Cosmic Lynx are based in the United Kingdom.\n\n\nimpersonated by Cosmic Lynx are based in the United Kingdom.\n\n\n**5**\n\n\n-----\n\nIntroductory email from the “lawyer” in a Cosmix Lynx attack.\n\n\nCosmic Lynx employs two strategies to make communications from the impersonated lawyer\nmore convincing. First, the group registers a domain that closely resembles the law firm’s actual\ndomain and create an email address on this domain to communicate with a target. For example,\nif an attorney’s real email address is john.doe@lawfirm.com, Cosmic Lynx would create an\naccount like john.doe@lawfirmllp.com to communicate with an employee.\n\n\nlawyer, a link to the legitimate law firm’s website, and a confidentiality disclaimer. An analysis\n\n\nSecond, to mimic the impersonated attorney’s communication patterns as closely as possible,\n\n\n-----\n\n“Lawyer” signature in Cosmic Lynx email.\n\n\nThe final phase of a Cosmic Lynx BEC attack is getting the target employee to send one or\nmore payments to mule accounts controlled by the group. A characteristic of Cosmic Lynx\nattacks that sticks out is the amount of money they request. The average amount requested in\n[most executive impersonation BEC attacks is $55,000. Cosmic Lynx, on the other hand, asks for](https://www.agari.com/cyber-intelligence-research/e-books/q1-2020-report.pdf#page=9)\nhundreds of thousands, sometimes millions of dollars.\n\nBased on our engagements with the group, it is clear their preference is to have a target send\npayments to mule accounts located in Hong Kong, which has become a common source of\ninternational mule accounts over the past few years. In every successful engagement we have\ninitiated with Cosmic Lynx, the initial mule account they have provided to us has been located\nin Hong Kong.\n\n\nTo better understand how a BEC threat actor will adapt, we commonly give them reasons why\na payment to their first mule account is not possible. In typical cases, BEC actors who originally\nprovide an international bank account will follow up with a secondary mule account that is\nlocated in the US or the same country as the target. For Cosmic Lynx, though, they seem to\nbe consciously resistant to provide mule accounts in certain countries, like the US. Even when\nwe give them no other options, the group actively refuses to disclose mule accounts in the US.\nThis could mean that either the group does not have a supply of mules in the US or for other\nreasons, they prefer not to use bank accounts in the US to receive illicit funds. Outside Hong\nKong, secondary accounts provided by Cosmic Lynx have been located in Hungary, Portugal,\nand Romania.\n\n\nand Romania.\n\n\nThis could mean that either the group does not have a supply of mules in the US or for other\nreasons, they prefer not to use bank accounts in the US to receive illicit funds.

They are\nmore interested in identifying employees who have access to money, regardless if they work\nfor a small, five-person company or an organization with thousands of employees. In contrast,\nCosmic Lynx has a clear target preference: large, multinational organizations. Nearly all of the\ntarget organizations we have identified have a global presence and many of them are Fortune\n500 or Global 2000 companies. These target organizations are headquartered in 20 countries;\nhowever, because most of the organizations are global, employees targeted by Cosmic Lynx\nBEC campaigns are located in 46 countries on six continents. Even employees in countries not\ntypically seen in phishing campaign targeting sets, like Namibia and Mongolia, were targeted by\nCosmic Lynx.\n\n\nMap of Cosmic Lynx targets.\n\n\n-----\n\nTo identify employees to target with BEC attacks, groups generally use legitimate commercial\nservices that allow them to conduct a finely tuned search for employees based on a number\nof variables, such as title, location, and company revenue. Based on a review of employees\ntargeted by Cosmic Lynx, it is clear that they are using a similar service to identify targets\nspecifically by their title.\n\nAll of the employees targeted in Cosmic Lynx BEC campaigns are senior-level employees at\na company. Three quarters of employees targeted hold the titles of Vice President, General\nManager, or Managing Director at a company. Other positions explicitly targeted by Cosmic\nLynx include CEO (generally, subsidiary or country-level CEOs), CFO, and President. Because\nCosmic Lynx is focused on large, global companies, another interesting aspect of their attacks\nis that they rarely target employees multiple times. Instead, they will target employees with the\nsame title at a company located in different countries.\n\n\nManaging Director\n\nVice President\n\n\nGeneral Manager\n\nCEO\n\nCFO\n\n\nPresident\n\nOther\n\n\n-----\n\n## Hitting D-MARC\n#### How Cosmic Lynx Exploits DMARC Controls\n\n[The DMARC standard was created to prevent malicious actors from directly spoofing an](https://www.agari.com/insights/ebooks/getting-started-with-dmarc/)\norganization’s domain when sending an email. The standard was published in 2012 and\nallows organizations to authenticate legitimate email messages and sources for their emailsending domains and publish explicit policies that instruct mailbox providers what to do with\ninauthentic messages. The most aggressive DMARC policy is “reject” (p=reject), which means\nthat email messages that do not pass DMARC authentication will be rejected by a mail server\nand not delivered to a user. In essence, with an effective DMARC policy at reject, cybercriminals\nare not able to directly spoof an organization’s domain.\n\n\nWhile spoofed domains can be used to create very realistic-looking phishing emails, very few\n[BEC attacks leverage spoofed domains. In our latest quarterly Email Fraud & Identity Deception](https://www.agari.com/cyber-intelligence-research/e-books/q1-2020-report.pdf)\n[Trends report, we found that 96% of all BEC attacks used free webmail accounts or registered](https://www.agari.com/cyber-intelligence-research/e-books/q1-2020-report.pdf)\ndomains to send malicious emails.\n\nCosmic Lynx, though, is part of the 4% of attacks to exploit organizations that do not have an\nestablished DMARC policy. This enhances the authenticity of their emails by directly spoofing\nthe email addresses of CEOs when possible. Based on our analysis of historical Cosmic Lynx\nattacks, it is clear that the group is aware of which target organizations have implemented an\neffective DMARC policy and which organizations have not.\n\n\nIf a company has not implemented a DMARC policy or has a policy set to monitor-only\n(p=none), Cosmic Lynx will directly spoof the CEO’s email address and set the Reply-To\nemail to their operational email account they use to actually correspond with a victim. If an\norganization has an established DMARC policy set to reject or quarantine (p=quarantine),\nCosmic Lynx will not spoof the sending email address. Instead, the group changes the display\nname impersonating the CEO to include their email address, which still gives the look that the\nemail is coming directly from the CEO’s account (e.g., “John Smith - jsmith@acme.com”).\n\n\n-----\n\nSpoofed (top) vs. non-spoofed (bottom) Cosmic Lynx emails.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Exploiting a Pandemic\n#### How Cosmic Lynx Has Leveraged COVID-19 in Their Attacks\n\nPhishing attacks exploiting the COVID-19 pandemic started to skyrocket in March 2020.\n[Malware campaigns, credential phishing lures, and BEC attacks all started adopting COVID-19](https://www.agari.com/email-security-blog/covid-19-credential-phishing-scams-coronavirus/)\nthemes as a way to increase the success rate of their attacks. Cosmic Lynx was no different.\n\n\nIn late-March, the group began inserting language referencing the pandemic into their BEC\ncampaign emails as a social-engineering icebreaker that preceded their main request. Because\nCOVID-19 has impacted nearly everyone in the world, it afforded Cosmic Lynx an opportunity\nto disarm a target’s suspicions by building rapport with them at the beginning of an initial email\nregardless of where the target was located. Some of the pandemic-themed content used by\nCosmic Lynx included the following:\n\n\nwith the COVID-19 virus has all of us worried.\n\n\nI trust this emails (sic) finds you safe and well. The current situation\n\n\n-----\n\nAs the peak of the pandemic passed for most countries by late-May, Cosmic Lynx shifted their\ntone and began referencing the reopening of global economies as an introduction to their\nemails. Like the earlier references to COVID-19, these introductions are meant to get a target to\nput down their defenses before the Cosmic Lynx actor gets to what they really want. Some of\nthe introductions used by Cosmic Lynx after the COVID-19 peak included the following:\n\nAs the world emerges from lockdown restrictions, we are\ncautiously optimistic that the worst is finally behind us.\n\n“As countries around the world gradually ease lockdown\nrestrictions and companies resume business, we must now\nlook beyond the crisis and position ourselves for the economic\nrecovery.”\n\n“The last many weeks have been very challenging but the worst is\nmost likely over as normalcy is gradually returning with countries\neasing restrictions. We anticipate a robust rebound in the economy\nand are seizing the opportunity to further develop our business.”\n\nPrior to the global rise of COVID-19, Cosmic Lynx’s emails were rather generic, which makes\ntheir pivot to pandemic themes that much more notable. Like many cybercriminals out there,\nthis indicates they are savvy enough to pay attention to global events and adapt their attacks\nto exploit them.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n## Putting the “Cosmic” in Cosmic Lynx\n#### A Look at Cosmic Lynx’s Operational Infrastructure\n\nAttacker infrastructure is another one of the key differences between Cosmic Lynx and other\nBEC groups. While most BEC actors tend to gravitate to free webmail accounts or remotelyhosted cloud services, Cosmic Lynx consistently chooses to host their own email infrastructure\nwith a small number of hosting providers. By hosting, managing, controlling, and running\ntheir own email infrastructure, Cosmic Lynx is able to be more resistant to law enforcement\noperations which may target their campaigns.\n\n\n##### Putting the “Cosmic” in Cosmic Lynx\n\nEmail addresses created by Cosmic Lynx to send their campaigns seem to mimic secure email\nand network infrastructure. The mailbox referenced in a Cosmic Lynx email address (the part\nof an email address before the “@”) usually references celestial bodies, like planets and stars-hence the “Cosmic” in Cosmic Lynx--similar to the naming convention of some SMTP or DNS\nname servers. Examples of these mailbox names include “smtp-mars,” “mx-taurus,” “tls-sirius,”\nand gateway-mercury.”\n\n\nSimilarly, domains registered by Cosmic Lynx are named in a way to impersonate secure email\ninfrastructure (e.g., secure-mail-gateway[.]cc, encrypted-smtp-transport[.]cc, mx-secure-net[.]\ncom). In some cases, Cosmic Lynx has referenced Fortinet, a US-based cybersecurity that\noffers endpoint security and secure email gateway products, in their domains (e.g., fortinethost-protection[.]cc, fortinet-server[.]cc, fortinet-gateway[.]cc).\n\n_See Appendix A for a full list of domains linked to Cosmic Lynx attacks._\n\n\n##### Manipulating Email Flow, Not Just for Email Engineers\n\nMost BEC actors simply purchase a domain or use a free webmail account, with attackers\nfrequently cycling through accounts and domains as they’re taken down. Cosmic Lynx\npurchases domains too; however, they put much more work and effort into securing the\ninfrastructure from outsiders investigating the domains.\n\n\ninfrastructure from outsiders investigating the domains.\n\n\nflow. After Cosmic Lynx registers their domain for a specific campaign, the attackers point the\ntop-level domain (TLD) at Cloudflare to make the domain appear more legitimate. Next, the\nattackers create a subdomain to use as the MX record, or the place where emails will be sent\n\n\nCosmic Lynx makes heavy use of DNS MX records for their email accounts to manipulate mail\n\n\n-----\n\nThis is a key differentiator when comparing traditional BEC actors and Cosmic Lynx, as true\nunderstanding of how email flow and editing DNS records is a skill that far exceeds traditional\nBEC actors.\n\n##### DMARC: Not Just for the Good Guys\n\n\nWhile Cosmic Lynx is more than happy to spoof email infrastructure to target an organization\nwith a BEC attempt, the attackers aren’t fans of having someone else spoof their infrastructure.\nCosmic Lynx is able to monitor for any attempts at spoofing their domain by using properlyconfigured DMARC policies on their domain infrastructure. In a vast majority of cases, Cosmic\nLynx DMARC domains are configured to send spoofs to abuse@[domain], with variations\nincluding legal@[domain] and dmarc@[domain]. By using these email accounts, not only\ndoes Cosmic Lynx receive a copy of any person trying to spoof them, but they could fool\nunsuspecting users into reporting fraud attacks to them, too.\n\nAdditionally, if DMARC is not enabled, anyone is able to spoof the origins of the sending\ndomain. By having this security feature disabled, spam bots and other parties are able to piggyback on the reputation of the sending domain, which would negatively impact the reputation of\nthe sending domain. In the case of Cosmic Lynx, their entire existence in the BEC space relies\non emails landing in the inboxes of users, and if their delivery domains have poor Senderbase\nReputation Scores (SBRS), most security appliances will refuse or flag these emails as being\nsuspicious.\n\n\n**17**\n\n\nCosmic Lynx DMARC policies.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Fortifying Infrastructure with Bulletproof Hosting\n\nIn order to make their infrastructure more resilient and mask their identity in WHOIS records,\nCosmic Lynx has registered a number of their domains with NiceVPS, a bulletproof hosting and\nanonymous domain provider. Based on a review of other domains registered with NiceVPS, it is\nclear that the service caters to cybercriminals.\n\n\nNiceVPS homepage.\n\n\nInstead of using basic Whois privacy when registering a domain, NiceVPS registers a domain\non their customers’ behalf with their anonymous domain name service, adding an additional\nlayer of anonymity between the domain and Cosmic Lynx. Instead of showing masked\nregistrant details, a domain’s Whois record will just show contact details for NiceVPS, under the\norganization name “Nice IT Services Group Inc.” NiceVPS also does not require registrants to\nprovide any personal information when registering a domain and purchases can be made using\nbitcoin, making it even harder to track someone’s identity.\n\n\nAnonymous domain service from NiceVPS.\n\n\n**18**\n\n\n-----\n\nTo make the infrastructure more friendly for scammers, NiceVPS makes use of a warrant canary,\nwhich will let users know if information has been subpoenaed or requested by law enforcement.\nIf the warrant canary is not updated after a pre-determined period of time, this will tip the users\nof the infrastructure off that law enforcement intervention may be happening, giving attackers\ntime to react and clean up their tracks.\n\n\nNiceVPS warrant canary message.\n\n\n##### Trickbot, Emotet, and BEC...Oh My!\n\nOne of the more notable aspects of Cosmic Lynx’s BEC infrastructure is its links to other types\nof malicious activity, particularly malware infrastructure. Because Cosmic Lynx controls their\ninfrastructure so closely, this may indicate deeper connections to the criminal underground that\nhave not been observed by previous BEC actors.\n\n\n[click fraud malware](https://blog.zimperium.com/fake-play-market-zimperiums-z9-social-engineering-attack-vectors/)\n\n\nto Cosmic Lynx infrastructure pointed to the IP address, a sample of Trickbot, one of today’s\nmost active banking Trojans, was seen making SSL connections to this IP address, indicating\n\n\nThis time frame overlaps with two other domains, adsclubpartners[.]ru and 00xff[.]net, hosted\n\n\nprotection[.]cc and cx[.]fortinet-gateway[.]cc, were hosted on IP address 46[.]249[.]62[.]202.\n\n\n-----\n\nPCAP of Trickbot sample connecting to 93[.]158[.]208[.]104 (Source: VirusTotal).\n\n\nBetween March 2020 and April 2020, one of Cosmic Lynx’s mail servers, mail[.]mx-securenet[.]com, was hosted on IP 139[.]162[.]120[.]155. Between October and December 2019,\nmultiple malicious word documents linked to the Emotet banking Trojan were observed being\ndownloaded from the IP address.\n\nBetween January 2020 and February 2020, one of Cosmic Lynx’s mail servers, vs[.]mxgateway-host[.]cc resolved to IP address 46[.]249[.]59[.]67. Around June 2019, this IP address\nwas hosting Azorult malware, which is capable of stealing chat messages, browser history,\nand financial information. Between March 2019 and October 2019, this IP address also hosted\nmrgreen[.]ws, a carding marketplace that has been in operation since 2014.\n\n\nbecause we generally do not see these types of links with other BEC groups.\n\n\nmrgreen[.]ws, a carding marketplace that has been in operation since 2014.\n\n\nto more sophisticated malicious activity across multiple service providers is notable, though,\n\n\nMalware authors and other cybercriminals frequently cycle through infrastructure and in some\n\n\n-----\n\n## Who is Cosmic Lynx?\n#### Exposing Cosmic Lynx’s Russian Origin\n\n[Historically, a vast majority of BEC attacks have originated from actors in Nigeria. Looking](https://www.agari.com/insights/whitepapers/behind-the-from-lines/)\nat Cosmic Lynx’s attacks, though, it is clear they are a different breed than other active\ncybercriminal groups conducting BEC operations. Our assessment finds that Cosmic Lynx is\nlikely composed of Russia-based actors, based on analysis of their attacks and infrastructure.\n\n\nThe first piece of evidence that ties back to a Russian nexus is the time/date stamp in the\nemail headers of some of the Cosmic Lynx attacks. Generally, the Date field in an email header\nreflects the time and date an email was sent and usually includes a UTC offset. While this UTC\noffset can be modified by either the sender or routing infrastructure, in many cases this offset\nwill reflect the time zone of the sender. For many of the Cosmic Lynx attacks we have analyzed,\nthe UTC offset in the email headers are set to +0300 (MSK), which corresponds to Moscow\nStandard Time. Moscow Standard Time is only observed in the eastern parts of Russia, as well\nas Belarus and very small parts of Georgia and Ukraine. Since none of the routing infrastructure\nused by Cosmic Lynx or their targets are located in Russia, and it is unlikely an actor would\nspoof an MSK offset, we assess that this is the likely time zone of the sender(s) of these\nmessages.\n\n\nCosmic Lynx email header with Moscow Standard Time UTC offset.\n\n\nAs we discussed earlier, some of the infrastructure used by Cosmic Lynx to send BEC emails\noverlaps with infrastructure used by Trickbot and Emotet malware, which is believed to be tied\nto Russian actors. In addition to these potential connections, we have also observed multiple\ninstances where IP addresses linked to Cosmic Lynx’s BEC domain have overlapped with\ninfrastructure used to host Russian fake document websites. These sites, which seem to be\ncatering to individuals in Russia and Ukraine, sell a variety of false Russian-language documents,\nsuch as diplomas, birth certificates, and death certificates.\n\n\ncatering to individuals in Russia and Ukraine, sell a variety of false Russian-language documents,\n\n\noverlaps with infrastructure used by Trickbot and Emotet malware, which is believed to be tied\nto Russian actors.

During one of our engagements\nwith Cosmic Lynx, they sent us a document containing wire transfer instructions for a payment,\nas well as a fake non-disclosure agreement. A review of the metadata of these documents\nshows they were last saved by user “Serge Devant” prior to being sent to us. Serge Devant\nis the name of a DJ from Saint Petersburg, Russia. While the name of this user can be easily\nchanged to reflect any name, using the name of a Russian DJ, regardless of whether it is\nlegitimate or not, is notable. It should be noted that we have no evidence that the real Serge\nDevant is associated with Cosmic Lynx activity.\n\n\nWhile none of these pieces of evidence on their own would warrant a solid attribution case, we\n\n\nbelieve looking at the totality of evidence together builds a strong circumstantial argument that\n\n\nsome, if not all, Cosmic Lynx actors are based in Russia.\n\n\n**23**\n\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBusiness email compromise has become the predominant cyber\nthreat businesses face today. Since 2016, businesses have lost at least\n[$26 billion as a result of BEC attacks and, based on the most recent](https://www.ic3.gov/media/2019/190910.aspx)\n[FBI IC3 report, losses from BEC attacks grew another 37 percent in](https://pdf.ic3.gov/2019_IC3Report.pdf)\n2019, accounting for 40 percent of all cybercrime losses over the\ncourse of the year. Evidence that more sophisticated threat groups\nare adding BEC to their attack repertoire should concern everyone.\nUnlike traditional BEC groups, Cosmic Lynx has demonstrated the\ncapability to develop much more complex and creative attacks\nthat sets them apart from other more generic BEC attacks we see\neveryday.\n\n\nSince 2016, businesses\nhave lost at least\n### $26B\n\nas a result of BEC\nattacks\n\n\nTo protect against threats like these, organizations first need to\nunderstand and accept the state of today’s cyber threat landscape.\nMost email-based threats today, like BEC attacks, are very simple\nsocial engineering attacks that are technically unsophisticated. To\neffectively protect against these threats, companies need to make\nsure they have defenses in place that are equipped to detect identity\ndeception attacks that traditional inbound filters are not accustomed\nto handling. Additionally, organizations should have good internal\nprocesses in place, so payment requests, regardless of source, are\nverified before they are processed.\n\n\nlosses from BEC\nattacks grew another\n\n### 37%\n\n\nin 2019, accounting for\n### 40%\n\nof all cybercrime\nlosses over the course\nof the year\n\n\n-----\n\n## Appendix A:\n#### Domains Used in Cosmic Lynx BEC Attacks\n\n\ncloud-front-gateway[.]cc\n\nconfidential-privileged[.]com\n\n\nsecure-email-server[.]cc\n\nsecure-email-server[.]net\n\n\nemail-gateway-host[.]cc\n\nencrypted-gateway[.]cc\n\n\nsecure-email-service[.]com\n\nsecure-mail-cast[.]com\n\n\nencrypted-host[.]cc\n\nencrypted-mail-gateway[.]cc\n\nencrypted-mail-server[.]com\n\n\nsecure-mail-gateway[.]cc\n\nsecure-mail-host[.]cc\n\n\nencrypted-network[.]cc\n\nencrypted-smtp-transport[.]cc\n\n\nsecure-mail-host[.]com\n\nsecure-mail-net[.]cc\n\n\nsecure-mail-net[.]com\n\nsecure-mail-provider[.]cc\n\n\neu-1-host-protection[.]cc\n\nfortinet-gateway[.]cc\n\n\nfortinet-host-protection[.]cc\n\nfortinet-host[.]cc\n\n\nsecure-mail-provider[.]com\n\nsecure-mail-server[.]cc\n\n\nsecure-mx-gateway[.]cc\n\nsecure-mx-host[.]com\n\n\nfortinet-protection[.]cc\n\nfortinet-server[.]cc\n\n\nmail-transport-agent[.]cc\n\nmail-transport-gateway[.]cc\n\n\nsecure-mx-provider[.]cc\n\nsecure-mx-server[.]cc\n\n\nmail-transport-host[.]cc\n\nmail-transport-protection[.]cc\n\n\nsecure-mx-service[.]cc\n\nsecure-server-smtp[.]cc\n\n\nsecure-smtp-delivery[.]cc\n\nsecure-smtp-gateway[.]cc\n\nsecure-smtp-host[.]cc\n\n\nmx-gateway-host[.]cc\n\nmx-secure-email-host[.]cc\n\n\nmx-secure-email-server[.]cc\n\nmx-secure-net[.]com\n\n\nsecure-smtp-host[.]com\n\nsecure-smtp-provider[.]cc\n\n\nsmtp-gateway-host[.]cc\n\nsmtp-secure-gateway[.]cc\n\n\nsecure-email-provider[.]com\n\n\nnode-protection[.]cc\n\nprivileged-secured[.]com\n\n\nsecure-smtp-server[.]cc\n\nsecure-smtp-server[.]com\n\n\nsecure-email-net[.]cc\n\nsecure-email-provider[.]cc\n\n\nsecure-email-net[.]cc\n\n\nsmtp-secure-service[.]cc\n\nsmtp-server-relay[.]com\n\n\nsmtp-gateway-host[.]cc\n\nsmtp-secure-gateway[.]cc\n\n\nsecure-smtp-service[.]cc\n\nsecure-smtp-service[.]com\n\nsecure-ssl-sec[.]com\n\n\nnode-protection[.]cc\n\nprivileged-secured[.]com\n\n\n-----\n\n## Appendix B:\n#### IP Addresses Associated with Cosmic Lynx Mail Servers\n\n\n5[.]133[.]179[.]37\n\n5[.]133[.]179[.]43\n\n5[.]133[.]179[.]55\n\n23[.]95[.]97[.]12\n\n23[.]95[.]97[.]19\n\n23[.]95[.]97[.]30\n\n23[.]95[.]97[.]37\n\n23[.]95[.]97[.]47\n\n23[.]95[.]97[.]52\n\n23[.]95[.]97[.]58\n\n45[.]90[.]58[.]30\n\n46[.]19[.]137[.]132\n\n46[.]19[.]137[.]138\n\n46[.]19[.]137[.]142\n\n\n94[.]242[.]206[.]195\n\n94[.]242[.]206[.]204\n\n\n94[.]242[.]206[.]210\n\n94[.]242[.]206[.]219\n\n94[.]242[.]206[.]68\n\n95[.]154[.]199[.]159\n\n95[.]154[.]199[.]191\n\n\n134[.]119[.]191[.]53\n\n139[.]162[.]120[.]155\n\n139[.]162[.]184[.]177\n\n139[.]162[.]199[.]16\n\n\n46[.]249[.]59[.]122\n\n46[.]249[.]59[.]67\n\n46[.]249[.]59[.]81\n\n\n139[.]162[.]97[.]171\n\n172[.]105[.]175[.]51\n\n172[.]105[.]213[.]70\n\n172[.]105[.]39[.]21\n\n\n46[.]249[.]59[.]99\n\n46[.]249[.]62[.]202\n\n46[.]249[.]62[.]207\n\n\n172[.]105[.]40[.]251\n\n172[.]105[.]67[.]170\n\n179[.]43[.]159[.]20\n\n179[.]43[.]160[.]34\n\n\n46[.]249[.]62[.]213\n\n46[.]249[.]62[.]239\n\n\n194[.]5[.]250[.]131\n\n194[.]5[.]250[.]133\n\n194[.]5[.]250[.]195\n\n194[.]5[.]250[.]220\n\n\n51[.]75[.]223[.]210\n\n\n89[.]105[.]202[.]103\n\n89[.]105[.]202[.]79\n\n\n94[.]242[.]206[.]153\n\n94[.]242[.]206[.]166\n\n\n94[.]242[.]206[.]153\n\n94[.]242[.]206[.]166\n\n\n212[.]38[.]166[.]4\n\n\n212[.]38[.]166[.]4\n\n\n212[.]38[.]166[.]184\n\n212[.]38[.]166[.]199\n\n212[.]38[.]166[.]34\n\n\n89[.]105[.]202[.]103\n\n89[.]105[.]202[.]79\n\n\n-----\n\n## Appendix C:\n#### Email Subject Lines Used in Cosmic Lynx BEC Campaigns\n\n\nJuly 2019 -
