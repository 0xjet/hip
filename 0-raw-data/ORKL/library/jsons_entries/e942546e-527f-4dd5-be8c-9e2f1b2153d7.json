CISA has observed these—and other threat\nactors with varying degrees of skill—routinely using open-source information to plan and\nexecute cyber operations. CISA leveraged the MITRE Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and\nCommon Knowledge (ATT&CK®) and Pre-ATT&CK frameworks to characterize the TTPs\nused by Chinese MSS-affiliated actors. This product was written by CISA with contributions\nby the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\nChinese MSS-affiliated cyber threat actors use open-source information to plan and\nconduct cyber operations.\nChinese MSS-affiliated cyber threat actors use readily available exploits and exploit\ntoolkits to quickly engage target networks.\nMaintaining a rigorous patching cycle continues to be the best defense against the\nmost frequently used attacks.\nIf critical vulnerabilities remain unpatched, cyber threat actors can carry out attacks\nwithout the need to develop custom malware and exploits or use previously unknown\nvulnerabilities to target a network.\nThis Advisory identifies some of the more common—yet most effective—TTPs\nemployed by cyber threat actors, including Chinese MSS-affiliated cyber threat actors.\n\n[Click here for a PDF version of this report.](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/AA20-258A-Chinese_Ministry_of_State_Security-Affiliated_Cyber_Threat_Actor_Activity_S508C.pdf)\n\n## Technical Details\n\nThrough the operation of the National Cybersecurity Protection System (NCPS) and by\nfulfilling its mission as the national risk advisor, CISA has observed Chinese MSS-affiliated\ncyber threat actors operating from the People’s Republic of China using commercially\navailable information sources and open-source exploitation tools to target U.S. Government\nagency networks.\n\n\n-----\n\nAccording to a recent U.S. Department of Justice indictment, MSS-affiliated actors have\ntargeted various industries across the United States and other countries—including high-tech\nmanufacturing; medical device, civil, and industrial engineering; business, educational, and\ngaming software; solar energy; pharmaceuticals; and defense—in a campaign that lasted\n[over ten years.[1] These hackers acted for both their own personal gain and the benefit of](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-chinese-hackers-working-ministry-state-security-charged-global-computer-intrusion)\n[the Chinese MSS.[2]](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-chinese-hackers-working-ministry-state-security-charged-global-computer-intrusion)\n\nAccording to the indictment,\n\n_To conceal the theft of information from victim networks and otherwise evade detection, the_\n_defendants typically packaged victim data in encrypted Roshal Archive Compressed files_\n_(RAR files), changed RAR file and victim documents’ names and extensions (e.g., from “.rar”_\n_to “.jpg”) and system timestamps, and concealed programs and documents at innocuous-_\n_seeming locations on victim networks and in victim networks’ “recycle bins.” The defendants_\n_frequently returned to re-victimize companies, government entities, and organizations from_\n_which they had previously stolen data, in some cases years after the initial successful data_\n_theft. In several instances, however, the defendants were unsuccessful in this regard, due to_\n_the efforts of the FBI and network defenders._\n\nThe continued use of open-source tools by Chinese MSS-affiliated cyber threat actors\nhighlights that adversaries can use relatively low-complexity capabilities to identify and\nexploit target networks. In most cases, cyber operations are successful because\nmisconfigurations and immature patch management programs allow actors to plan and\nexecute attacks using existing vulnerabilities and known exploits. Widespread\nimplementation of robust configuration and patch management programs would greatly\nincrease network security. It would also reduce the speed and frequency of opportunistic\nattacks by forcing threat actors to dedicate time and funding to research unknown\nvulnerabilities and develop custom exploitation tools.\n\n## MITRE PRE-ATT&CK® Framework for Analysis\n\nIn the last 12 months, CISA analysts have routinely observed Chinese MSS-affiliated actors\nusing the following PRE-ATT&CK® Framework TTPs.\n\n**Target Selection and Technical Information Gathering**\n\n_Target Selection_ [[TA0014] is a critical part of cyber operations. While cyber threat actors’](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/tactics/TA0014/)\nmotivations and intents are often unknown, they often make their selections based on the\ntarget network’s security posture. Threat actors can use information sources such as\nShodan, the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure (CVE) database, and the National\n[Vulnerabilities Database (NVD).[3][4][5]](https://www.shodan.io/)\n\n\n-----\n\nShodan is an internet search engine that can be used to identify vulnerable devices\nconnected to the internet. Shodan queries can also be customized to discover specific\nvulnerabilities on devices, which enables sophisticated cyber threat actors to use\nrelatively unsophisticated techniques to execute opportunistic attacks on susceptible\ntargets.\nThe CVE database and the NVD contain detailed information about vulnerabilities in\napplications, appliances, and operating systems that can be exploited by cyber threat\nactors if they remain unpatched. These sources also provide risk assessments if any of\nthe recorded vulnerabilities are successfully exploited.\n\nThese information sources have legitimate uses for network defense. CISA analysts are able\nto identify Federal Government systems that may be susceptible to exploitation attempts by\nusing Shodan, the CVE database, and the NVD to enrich NCPS information. Unlike threat\nactors, CISA takes the necessary actions to notify network owners of their exposure in order\nto prevent an impending intrusion or quickly identify intrusions as they occur.\n\nWhile using these data sources, CISA analysts have observed a correlation between the\npublic release of a vulnerability and targeted scanning of systems identified as being\nvulnerable. This correlation suggests that cyber threat actors also rely on Shodan, the CVE\ndatabase, the NVD, and other open-source information to identify targets of opportunity and\nplan cyber operations. Together, these data sources provide users with the understanding of\na specific vulnerability, as well as a list of systems that may be vulnerable to attempted\nexploits. These information sources therefore contain invaluable information that can lead\ncyber threat actors to implement highly effective attacks.\n\nCISA has observed Chinese MSS-affiliated actors using the techniques in table 1 to gather\ntechnical information to enable cyber operations against Federal Government networks\n(Technical Information Gathering [[TA0015]).](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/tactics/TA0015/)\n\n_Table 1: Technical information gathering techniques observed by CISA_\n\n**MITRE**\n**ID** **Name** **Observation**\n\n\n[T1245](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1245/) Determine\nApproach/Attack\nVector\n\n[T1247](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1247/) Acquire Open\nSource Intelligence\n(OSINT) Data Sets\nand Information\n\n\nThe threat actors narrowed the attack vectors to relatively\nrecent vulnerability disclosures with open-source exploits.\n\nCISA observed activity from network proxy service\nInternet Protocol (IP) addresses to three Federal\nGovernment webpages. This activity appeared to enable\ninformation gathering activities.\n\n\n-----\n\n**MITRE**\n**ID** **Name** **Observation**\n\n\n[T1254](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1254/) Conduct Active\nScanning\n\n\nCISA analysts reviewed the network activity of known\nthreat actor IP addresses and found evidence of\nreconnaissance activity involving virtual security devices.\n\n\n**Technical Weakness Identification**\n\nCISA analysts consistently observe targeting, scanning, and probing of significant\nvulnerabilities within days of their emergence and disclosure. This targeting, scanning, and\nprobing frequently leads to compromises at the hands of sophisticated cyber threat actors. In\nsome cases, cyber threat actors have used the same vulnerabilities to compromise multiple\norganizations across many sectors. Organizations do not appear to be mitigating known\nvulnerabilities as quickly as cyber threat actors are exploiting them. CISA recently released\nan alert that highlighted the top 10 vulnerabilities routinely exploited by sophisticated foreign\n[cyber threat actors from 2016 to 2019.[6]](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-133a%20)\n\nAdditionally, table 2 provides a list of notable compromises by Chinese MSS-affiliated actors\nwithin the past 12 months.\n\n_Table 2: Significant CVEs targeted by Chinese MSS-affiliated actors in the last 12 months_\n\n**Vulnerability** **Observations**\n\n\nCVE-20205902: F5\nBig-IP\nVulnerability\n\nCVE-201919781: Citrix\nVirtual\nPrivate\nNetwork\n(VPN)\nAppliances\n\n\nCISA has conducted incident response engagements at Federal\nGovernment and commercial entities where the threat actors exploited\nCVE-2020-5902. This is a vulnerability in F5’s Big-IP Traffic Management\nUser Interface that allows cyber threat actors to execute arbitrary system\ncommands, create or delete files, disable services, and/or execute Java\n[code.[7]](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-206a%20)\n\nCISA has observed the threat actors attempting to discover vulnerable\nCitrix VPN Appliances. CVE-2019-19781 enabled the actors to execute\n[directory traversal attacks.[8]](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-031a%20)\n\n\n-----\n\n**Vulnerability** **Observations**\n\n\nCVE-201911510: Pulse\nSecure VPN\nServers\n\nCVE-20200688:\nMicrosoft\nExchange\nServer\n\n\nCISA has conducted multiple incident response engagements at Federal\nGovernment and commercial entities where the threat actors exploited\nCVE-2019-11510—an arbitrary file reading vulnerability affecting Pulse\nSecure VPN appliances—to gain access to victim networks. Although\nPulse Secure released patches for CVE-2019-11510 in April 2019, CISA\nobserved incidents where compromised Active Directory credentials were\n[used months after the victim organization patched their VPN appliance.[9]](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-107a%20%20)\n\nCISA has observed the actors exploiting CVE-2020-0688 for remote code\nexecution to enable email collection of targeted networks.\n\n\nAdditionally, CISA has observed Chinese MSS-affiliated actors using the techniques listed in\ntable 3 to identify technical weaknesses in Federal Government networks (Technical\n_[Weakness Identification [TA0018]).](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/tactics/TA0018/)_\n\n_Table 3: Technical weakness identification techniques observed by CISA_\n\n**MITRE**\n**ID** **Name** **Observation**\n\n\n[T1288](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1288/) Analyze\nArchitecture\nand\nConfiguration\nPosture\n\n[T1291](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1291/) Research\nRelevant\nVulnerabilities\n\n**Build Capabilities**\n\n\nCISA observed the cyber actors scanning a Federal Government\nagency for vulnerable web servers. CISA also observed the\nthreat actors scanning for known vulnerable network appliance\nCVE-2019-11510.\n\nCISA has observed the threat actors scanning and\nreconnaissance of Federal Government internet-facing systems\nshortly after the disclosure of significant CVEs.\n\n\nCISA analysts have observed cyber threat actors using command and control (C2)\ninfrastructure as part of their cyber operations. These observations also provide evidence\nthat threat actors can build and maintain relatively low-complexity capabilities, such as C2, to\n[enable cyber operations against Federal Government networks (Build Capabilities [TA0024]).](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/tactics/TA0024/)\nCISA has observed Chinese MSS-affiliated actors using the build capabilities summarized in\ntable 4.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Table 4: Build capabilities observed by CISA_\n\n**MITRE**\n**ID** **Name** **Observation**\n\n\n[T1352](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1352/) C2 Protocol\nDevelopment\n\n[T1328](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1328/) Buy Domain\nName\n\n[T1329](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1329/) Acquire and / or\nuse of 3rd Party\nInfrastructure\n\n[T1346](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1346) Obtain/Re-use\nPayloads\n\n[T1349](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1349) Build or Acquire\nExploit\n\n\nCISA observed beaconing from a Federal Government entity\nto the threat actors’ C2 server.\n\nCISA has observed the use of domains purchased by the\nthreat actors.\n\nCISA has observed the threat actors using virtual private\nservers to conduct cyber operations.\n\nCISA has observed the threat actors use and reuse existing\ncapabilities.\n\nCISA has observed the threat actors using a variety of opensource and publicly available exploits and exploit code to\ncompromise Federal Government networks.\n\n\n## MITRE ATT&CK Framework for Analysis\n\nCISA has observed sophisticated cyber threat actors, including Chinese MSS-affiliated\nactors, using commercial and open-source tools to conduct their operations. For example,\nthreat actors often leverage internet software repositories such as GitHub and Exploit-DB.\n\n[[10][11] Both repositories are commonly used for legitimate development and penetration](https://www.github.com%20/)\ntesting and developing open-source code, but cyber threat actors can also use them to find\ncode to enable nefarious actions.\n\nDuring incident response activities, CISA frequently observed Chinese government-affiliated\nactors using the open-source tools outlined in table 5.\n\n_Table 5: Common exploit tools CISA observed used by Chinese MSS-affiliated actors_\n\n**Tool** **Observations**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Tool** **Observations**\n\n\nCobalt\nStrike\n\nChina\nChopper\nWeb\nShell\n\n\nCISA has observed the threat actors using Cobalt Strike to target commercial\nand Federal Government networks. Cobalt Strike is a commercial penetration\ntesting tool used to conduct red team operations. It contains a number of tools\nthat complement the cyber threat actor’s exploitation efforts, such as a\nkeystroke logger, file injection capability, and network services scanners. CISA\nobserved connections from a Federal Government agency to multiple IP\naddresses possibly hosting Cobalt Strike team servers.\n\nCISA has observed the actors successfully deploying China Chopper against\norganizations’ networks. This open-source tool can be downloaded from\ninternet software repositories such GitHub and Exploit-DB. China Chopper is a\nweb shell hosted on a web server. It is mainly used for web application attacks,\nand it is configured in a client/server relationship. China Chopper contains\nsecurity scanners and can be used to upload files and brute-force passwords.\n\n\n[Mimikatz](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/software/S0002/) CISA has observed the actors using Mimikatz during their operations. This\nopen-source tool is used to capture account credentials and perform privilege\nescalation with pass-the-hash attacks that allow an attacker to pass captured\n[password hashes and authenticate to network devices.[12]](https://www.varonis.com/blog/what-is-mimikatz/%20)\n\nThe following sections list the ATT&CK Framework TTPs routinely employed by Chinese\ngovernment-affiliated actors to conduct cyber operations as observed by CISA analysts.\n\n**Initial Access**\n\nIn the last 12 months, CISA has observed Chinese MSS-affiliated actors use spearphishing\nemails with embedded links to actor-owned infrastructure and, in some cases, compromise\nor poison legitimate sites to enable cyber operations.\n\nCISA has observed the threat actors using the Initial Access [[TA0001] techniques identified](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/tactics/TA0001/)\nin table 6.\n\n_Table 6: Initial access techniques observed by CISA_\n\n**MITRE ID** **Name** **Observation**\n\n\n[T1204.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1204/001/) User\nExecution:\nMalicious Link\n\n\nCISA has observed indications that users have clicked\nmalicious links embedded in spearphishing emails that the\nthreat actors sent\n\n\n-----\n\n**MITRE ID** **Name** **Observation**\n\n\n[T1566.002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1566/002) Phishing:\nSpearphishing\nLink\n\n[T1190](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1190) Exploit PublicFacing\nApplication\n\n\nCISA analyzed network activity of a Federal Government\nentity and concluded that the threat actors sent a malicious\nemail weaponized with links.\n\nCISA has observed the actors leveraging CVE-2019-19781\nto compromise Citrix Application Delivery Controllers.\n\n\nCyber threat actors can continue to successfully launch these types of low-complexity\nattacks—as long as misconfigurations in operational environments and immature patch\nmanagement programs remain in place—by taking advantage of common vulnerabilities and\nusing readily available exploits and information.\n\n**Execution**\n\nCISA analysts continue to observe beaconing activity indicative of compromise or ongoing\naccess to Federal Government networks. This beaconing is a result of cyber threat actors\nsuccessfully completing cyber operations that are often designed around emergent\nvulnerabilities and reliant on existing exploitation tools, as mentioned in this document.\n\n[CISA has observed Chinese MSS-affiliated actors using the Execution [TA0002] technique](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/tactics/TA0002/)\nidentified in table 7.\n\n_Table 7: Execution technique observed by CISA_\n\n**MITRE**\n**ID** **Name** **Observation**\n\n\n[T1072](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1072) Software\nDeployment\nTools\n\n**Credential Access**\n\n\nCISA observed activity from a Federal Government IP address\nbeaconing out to the threat actors’ C2 server, which is usually an\nindication of compromise.\n\n\nCyber threat actors also continue to identify large repositories of credentials that are\navailable on the internet to enable brute-force attacks. While this sort of activity is not a direct\nresult of the exploitation of emergent vulnerabilities, it demonstrates that cyber threat actors\ncan effectively use available open-source information to accomplish their goals. Further, a\nthreat actor does not require a high degree of competence or sophistication to successfully\ncarry out this kind of opportunistic attack.\n\n\n-----\n\nCISA has observed Chinese MSS-affiliated actors using the Credential Access [[TA0006]](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/tactics/TA0006/)\ntechniques highlighted in table 8.\n\n_Table 8: Credential access techniques observed by CISA_\n\n**MITRE ID** **Name** **Observation**\n\n\n[T1003.001](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1003/001/) Operating System (OS)\nCredential Dumping:\nLocal Security Authority\nSubsystem Service\n(LSASS) Memory\n\n[T1110.004](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1110/004) Brute Force: Credential\nStuffing\n\n**Discovery**\n\n\nCISA observed the threat actors using Mimikatz in\nconjunction with coin miner protocols and\nsoftware. The actors used Mimikatz to dump\ncredentials from the OS using a variety of\ncapabilities resident within the tool.\n\nCISA observed what was likely a brute-force\nattack of a Remote Desktop Protocol on a publicfacing server.\n\n\nAs with any cyber operation, cyber threat actors must be able to confirm that their target is\nonline and vulnerable—there are a multitude of open-source scanning and reconnaissance\ntools available to them to use for this purpose. CISA consistently observes scanning activity\nacross federal agencies that is indicative of discovery techniques. CISA has observed\nChinese MSS-affiliated actors scanning Federal Government traffic using the discovery\ntechnique highlighted in table 9 (Discovery [[TA0007]).](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/tactics/TA0007/)\n\n_Table 9: Discovery technique observed by CISA_\n\n**MITRE**\n**ID** **Name** **Observation**\n\n\n[T1046](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1046/) Network\nService\nScanning\n\n**Collection**\n\n\nCISA has observed suspicious network scanning activity for\nvarious ports at Federal Government entities.\n\n\nWithin weeks of public disclosure of CVE-2020-0688, CISA analysts identified traffic that was\nindicative of Chinese MSS-affiliated threat actors attempting to exploit this vulnerability using\nthe Collection [[TA0009] technique listed in table 10.](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/tactics/TA0009/)\n\n_Table 10: Collection technique observed by CISA_\n\n\n-----\n\n**MITREMITRE**\n**IDID** **NameName** **ObservationObservation**\n\n\n[T1114](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1114) Email\nCollection\n\n\nCISA observed the actors targeting CVE-2020-0688 to collect emails\nfrom the exchange servers found in Federal Government\nenvironments.\n\n\n**Command and Control**\n\nCISA analysts often observe cyber threat actors using external proxy tools or hop points to\nenable their cyber operations while remaining anonymous. These proxy tools may be\ncommercially available infrastructure as a service (IaaS) or software as a service (SaaS) in\nthe form of a web browser promising anonymity on the internet. For example, “The Onion\nRouter” (Tor) is often used by cyber threat actors for anonymity and C2. Actor’s carefully\nchoose proxy tools depending on their intended use. These techniques are relatively low in\ncomplexity and enabled by commercially available tools, yet they are highly effective and\noften reliant upon existing vulnerabilities and readily available exploits.\n\nCISA has observed Chinese MSS-affiliated actors using the Command and Control [[TA0011]](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/tactics/TA0011/)\ntechniques listed in table 11.\n\n_Table 11: Command and control techniques observed by CISA_\n\n**MITRE ID** **Name** **Observation**\n\n\n[T1090.002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1090/002) Proxy: External\nProxy\n\n[T1090.003](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1090/003) Proxy: Multi-hop\nProxy\n\n[T1573.002](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1573/002) Encrypted\nChannel:\nAsymmetric\nCryptography\n\n## Mitigations\n\n\nCISA observed activity from a network proxy tool to 221\nunique Federal Government agency IP addresses.\n\nCISA observed activity from Tor that has resulted in\nconfirmed compromises of internet-facing Federal\nGovernment agency systems.\n\nCISA observed activity from Tor that has resulted in\nconfirmed compromises of internet-facing Federal\nGovernment agency systems.\n\n\nCISA asserts with high confidence that sophisticated cyber threat actors will continue to use\nopen-source resources and tools to target networks with a low security posture. When\nsophisticated cyber threat actors conduct operations against soft targets, it can negatively\n\n\n-----\n\nimpact critical infrastructure, federal, and state, local, tribal, territorial government networks,\npossibly resulting in loss of critical data or personally identifiable information.\n\nCISA and the FBI recommend that organizations place an increased priority on patching the\nvulnerabilities routinely exploited by MSS-affiliated cyber actors. See table 12 for patch\ninformation on the CVEs mentioned in this report.
