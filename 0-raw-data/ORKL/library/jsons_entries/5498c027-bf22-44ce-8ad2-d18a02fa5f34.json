Intrinsec’s CTI team decided to analyse these campaigns to unveil details of the attack chain\nwhich could be leveraged to anticipate further threats. As we will later describe in this report, by\nanalysing the infrastructure of the malware and its network communications, we were able to discover\na previously unknown Autonomous System that currently hosts a wide range of other malicious\nactivities.\n\n© I t i\n\n\n-----\n\n## Matanbuchus & Co: Code Emulation and Cybercrime Infrastructure Discovery\n\n TLP: CLEAR PAP: CLEAR\n\n\n# I - Strategical Intelligence\n\n### 1. Attribution\n\nThe loader leveraged for these campaigns was named “Matanbuchus” by its developer “BelialDemon”\nand is currently being sold to a limited number of clients for 10,000 dollars a month on an underground\nforum.\n\n_Figure 1. Thread of the Matanbuchus loader on Exploit._\n\nWe believe that the main client of this loader is the **Black Basta ransomware affiliate** **TA577. This**\naffiliate is [known](https://redcanary.com/threat-detection-report/threats/qbot/) for having deployed **QakBot and** **Cobalt Strike for both initial access and post**\n[exploitation purposes. In a campaign reported](https://www.esentire.com/blog/june-2022-qakbot-campaign) by eSentire and dating from June 2022, a Cobalt Strike\nbeacon loaded by QakBot communicated with two C2 servers (“extic[.]icu” and “reykh[.]icu”) which\nwere also [reported](https://github.com/pr0xylife/Matanbuchus/blob/main/Matanbuchus_16.06_2022.txt) by threat researchers Pr0xylife and [Brad Duncan](https://isc.sans.edu/diary/Malspam+pushes+Matanbuchus+malware+leads+to+Cobalt+Strike/28752) in a Matanbuchus campaign from\nthe same month.\n\n[In March 27[th], the Cryptolaemus team reported](https://twitter.com/Cryptolaemus1/status/1772757743062913152) a PikaBot and DarkGate campaign launched by TA577\nthat used the same techniques as a Matanbuchus campaign dating from 20 days earlier. As it can be\nobserved on the figure below, the Excel template and the method used to download the second stage\nfrom a Samba server is the same for the two campaigns.\n\n_Figure 2. Phishing templates that were used in both campaigns operated by TA577._\n\n© I t i\n\n\n-----\n\n## Matanbuchus & Co: Code Emulation and Cybercrime Infrastructure Discovery\n\n TLP: CLEAR PAP: CLEAR\n\n\n# II - Tactical Intelligence\n\n### 1. Tactics, Techniques and Procedures\n\n1.1. Malspam campaign\n\nThe campaign was launched on March 7[th] and started with an Excel document attached to an email.\nAn image on the document lures the user to click on an “Open” button to correctly display its content.\nInstead, it downloads and runs a JavaScript file named “Open_Document.PDF.js” hosted on a Samba\nserver with the IP “5.252.177[.]213”.\n\n_Figure 3. Content of the Excel document._\n\nThe purpose of the JavaScript file is to download a Matanbuchus DLL named “50k.png” and hosted on\n“988.skins[.]com/admin/view/stylesheet/50k.png”. This DLL is saved on the disk under the name\n“50.cpl” and launched with the [Living of the Land](https://lolbas-project.github.io/lolbas/Binaries/Control/) binary “control.exe” for evasion purposes. Launching\nthe malware with this process is an option advertised on the Matanbuchus thread on Exploit.\n\nOnce executed, the Matanbuchus DLL communicates with two C2 addresses,\n“muagol[.]com/Traffic/link/posting/index.php” and “gulappa[.]com”, to send information about the\ninfected host in a POST request. The data is encrypted and base64 encoded. It contains information\nlike the amount of RAM on the machine, the privileges of the user, the number of CPUs, the domain\nname, the computer’s name, and the MAC address.\n\n_Figure 4. Content of the POST request sent to the C2 by the Matanbuchus DLL._\n\n© I t i\n\n\n-----\n\n## Matanbuchus & Co: Code Emulation and Cybercrime Infrastructure Discovery\n\n TLP: CLEAR PAP: CLEAR\n\n\n1.2. Google ads campaign\n\nOn March 26[th], Unit42 [tweeted](https://twitter.com/Unit42_Intel/status/1772988284571877807) about a campaign abusing Google ads to push a malicious website\n“treasurybanks[.]org”, pretending to be an American bank that can recover unclaimed funds for the\ncitizens of the United States. Once on the website, the user is lured to download a report on how he\ncan claim those funds. The downloaded file is a ZIP archive named “q-report-53394.zip” containing a\nmalicious JavaScript named “q-report-60033.js”.\n\n_Figure 5. The malicious website appears as an ad after a search on Google._\n_Source:_ _[https://twitter.com/Unit42_Intel/status/1772988284571877807/photo/2.](https://twitter.com/Unit42_Intel/status/1772988284571877807/photo/2)_\n\nOnce executed by the user, the JavaScript file would download an .MSI installer that would download\nthe main **Matanbuchus DLL. As reported by Unit42 in its tweet, a** **DanaBot executable was then**\ndelivered on the host.\n\nThe creator of Matanbuchus is indeed promoting a discount of 1,000 dollars on his loader for users\nthat are already clients of DanaBot. The actor behind this campaign could have taken advantage of this\noffer as both malwares were deployed on the infected machine.\n\n_Figure 6. Message that appears on the thread of the Matanbuchus loader, where a discount is proposed for DanaBot clients._\n\nOne user on Exploit with the nickname “kaptoxa” publicly claimed that he was a client of Matanbuchus\nand DanaBot by complementing both malwares. Despite this information we could not associate this\nuser to the observed campaign.\n\n_Figure 7. Comments made by the user “kaptoxa” on the Matanbuchus and DanaBot threads on the forum “Exploit”._\n\n© I t i\n\n\n-----\n\n## Matanbuchus & Co: Code Emulation and Cybercrime Infrastructure Discovery\n\n TLP: CLEAR PAP: CLEAR\n\n\nThe domain hosting the Matanbuchus DLL “sweetapp[.]page” that is downloaded by the .MSI installer,\nwas hosted on what we believe to be a bulletproof Autonomous System based in Russia named\n“Komkov Vadim Aleksandrovich” (AS216234). Intrinsec’s CTI team listed the netblocks of this AS in\nthe “Indicators of compromise” section of this report.\n\n### 2. Code Analysis\n\n2.1. First stage JavaScript\n\nUpon clicking on the “Open” button in the Excel table, a JavaScript file is downloaded from\n“\\\\5.252.177[.]213\\share\\Open_Document.PDF.js” [(VirusTotal) and executed by](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/c66e705f800b30f591505be1c429c2e01b7851eb60bda14767d9d871151822e5) **wscript.exe. This**\nscript is slightly obfuscated as it mainly contains commented text about the war in Ukraine. Within\nthese comments are actual pieces of code that will be extracted and executed later.\n\n_Figure 8. Content of the JavaScript file mainly comments._\n\nAt the very end of the file are three obfuscated functions:\n\n    - One is used to retrieve the current script name,\n\n    - One is used to read the file’s content,\n\n    - One is used to regex the file’s content to retrieve the actual code and execute it.\n\n© I t i\n\n\n-----\n\n## Matanbuchus & Co: Code Emulation and Cybercrime Infrastructure Discovery\n\n TLP: CLEAR PAP: CLEAR\n\n\n_Figure 9. Obfuscated (left) and deobfuscated (right) parsing of the next stage script._\n\nThis next stage script contains code to download, save, and run another next stage from\n[“hxxps://988skins[.]com/admin/view/stylesheet/50k.png” (VirusTotal). This file is the Matanbuchus](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/url/bd66ac5f5b7f0f4f206ac2de67c38578b859c9ce6153024165cb52350b29a061)\nDLL, which is actually executed as a control panel file (.CPL) by passing it to control.exe as an argument.\n\n_Figure 10. Obfuscated (top) and deobfuscated (bottom) next stage script which downloads and executes Matanbuchus._\n\n© I t i\n\n\n-----\n\n## Matanbuchus & Co: Code Emulation and Cybercrime Infrastructure Discovery\n\n TLP: CLEAR PAP: CLEAR\n\n\n[It is interesting to note that a very similar technique was described](https://embee-research.ghost.io/latrodectus-script-deobfuscation/) recently by Embee Research. This\narticle is about a Latrodectus kill chain involving a JavaScript file filled with comments and a regex\nfunction to parse and execute relevant instructions.\n\n2.2. Main payload: Matanbuchus DLL\n\nThe main payload is a 32-bit Windows Portable Executable, compiled with Microsoft Visual C/C++\nversion 19.\n\n_Figure 11. Output of Detect It Easy._\n\nIts control flow is heavily obfuscated by useless instructions, and it contains several obfuscation\ntechniques such as dynamic API resolving, API hashing and string encryption, which we will detail later.\n\nIt contains three interesting exported functions:\n\n    - The entry point,\n\n    - DllRegisterServer,\n\n    - DllUnregisterServer.\n\n_Figure 12. Matanbuchus's exported functions._\n\nAll the other exports do not contain any analysis worthy code.\n\nFirst, we began by looking at the entry point, as it is the function executed when calling control.exe.\nBy following the execution flow dynamically in the debugger, we came upon a switch-case statement\nbased on fwdReason.\n\n© I t i\n\n\n-----\n\n## Matanbuchus & Co: Code Emulation and Cybercrime Infrastructure Discovery\n\n TLP: CLEAR PAP: CLEAR\n\n\n_Figure 13. Switch-case statement based on fdwReason._\n\nAs a reminder, fdwReason is an argument of the DllMain function. It is an unsigned integer indicating\n[why the DLL is being called. It can have the following values (additional information here):](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/dlls/dllmain)\n\n    - 0: DLL_PROCESS_DETACH\n\n    - 1: DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH\n\n    - 2: DLL_THREAD_ATTACH\n\n    - 3: DLL_THREAD_DETACH\n\nAs the DLL is loaded by control.exe, the value for fdwReason in our case is 1.\n\nFollowing the execution flow, we came upon an interesting function. Its role is to call all the functions\nreferenced within a certain address range in the data section.\n\n_Figure 14. Specific functions calling._\n\nAmong the function calls we found some interesting ones. One of those is used to retrieve a pointer\nto the TEB (Thread Environment Block) and stores it in a global variable. Other function calls are used\nto decrypt specific strings:\n\n    - DllResgisterServer, the name of an export\n\n    - hxxps://selevkis[.]app/useraccount.aspx, a URL\n\n    - hxxps://muagol[.]com/useraccount.aspx, a URL\n\n© I t i\n\n\n-----\n\n## Matanbuchus & Co: Code Emulation and Cybercrime Infrastructure Discovery\n\n TLP: CLEAR PAP: CLEAR\n\n\nThese URLs all host the same file (Matanbuchus DLL) under a different name (useraccount.aspx)\nmimicking an ASP.NET file name, which is usually used in the context of Microsoft IIS servers (Internet\nInformation Services).\n\nThese decrypting functions always follow the same scheme: an encrypted string construction on the\nstack for obfuscation, followed by the writing of this string in a global variable (.data section). Once\nthat is done, the actual decryption is made by passing the address of the encrypted string, its length, a\nkey and a bit shift to a function.\n\n_Figure 15. String decryption mechanism._\n\nWe were able to decrypt these strings dynamically using the debugger by setting a breakpoint right\nafter the decrypting function is called.\n\n_Figure 16. Dynamically decrypting strings using x64dbg._\n\nHowever, this function to decrypt strings is called 28 times (not only 3 times). Using the debugger, we\nwere not able to reach these calls due to anti-debugging techniques that we were not able to bypass.\n\n_Figure 17. Example of an anti-debug technique using assembly instruction INT 3 (opcode 0xCC)._\n\n© I t i\n\n\n-----\n\n## Matanbuchus & Co: Code Emulation and Cybercrime Infrastructure Discovery\n\n TLP: CLEAR PAP: CLEAR\n\n\n[To solve this problem and still be able to decrypt the strings, we used the emulation tool Dumpulator.](https://github.com/mrexodia/dumpulator)\nWe were then able to run the code and get the output of the decrypting function. Here is an example\nof a code section we were able to emulate that place two function calls:\n\n    - One to build the encrypted string,\n\n    - One to decrypt it.\n\n_Figure 18. Example of a string built and decrypted._\n\nTo be able to use Dumpulator, we must begin by generating a dump of a running process containing\nthe DLL. x64dbg contains such a feature, using the minidump command:\n\n_Figure 19. Creating a dump that will be used by Dumpulator._\n\nOnce done, all we had to do was write a script and give it the start and end addresses of the emulation.\n\n_Figure 20. Dumpulator script to decrypt a string._\n\n© I t i\n\n\n-----\n\n## Matanbuchus & Co: Code Emulation and Cybercrime Infrastructure Discovery\n\n TLP: CLEAR PAP: CLEAR\n\n\nTo go a little further, we added this functionality to an IDA plugin. Here is an extract of the code we\nused:\n\n_Figure 21: Extract of our IDA plugin to emulate x86 assembly using Dumpulator._\n\nHowever, this did not go exactly as planned, as a call (probably anti-analysis function) in the first\nfunction call (that we called “build_enc_str”) returned an error in the emulation:\n\n© I t i\n\n\n-----\n\n## Matanbuchus & Co: Code Emulation and Cybercrime Infrastructure Discovery\n\n TLP: CLEAR PAP: CLEAR\n\n\n_Figure 22. Where we had an error during the emulation._\n\nTo fix this issue, we have replaced all the instructions contained in this function by NOP instructions\n(opcode 0x90).\n\n_Figure 23. NOP-ed instructions to bypass the function. Error in the image, the last instruction \"POP EBP\" was not actually_\n\n_NOP-ed._\n\n_Figure 24. Patching the dump file using HXD._\n\n© I t i\n\n\n-----\n\n## Matanbuchus & Co: Code Emulation and Cybercrime Infrastructure Discovery\n\n TLP: CLEAR PAP: CLEAR\n\n\nOnce patched, the plugin (and emulation script) could execute correctly, and we were able to decrypt\nthe strings.\n\n_Figure 25: Using of our IDA plugin for x86 emulation based on Dumpulator to decrypt LoadLibraryA string._\n\nThe next stage was to find an easy way to locate interesting functions. To do so, we thought of creating\na list of all the functions sorted by the number of times they are called. This would indeed show if an\nencryption or a hashing function is used many times.\n\nWe then were able to write an IDA script for this purpose:\n\n_Figure 26. IDA script to list all the functions by the number of times they are called._\n\nThis enabled us to locate a function we called “resolve_hashed_api”, which is used to locate the\naddresses of Windows APIs from a hashed value directly within the client-side code. This technique is\ncalled API hashing. It starts by iterating over the InMemoryOrderModuleList structure of the Ldr to find\nthe base address of the DLL which contains the API (usually kernel32.dll), then iterates over all the\n\n© I t i\n\n\n-----\n\n## Matanbuchus & Co: Code Emulation and Cybercrime Infrastructure Discovery\n\n TLP: CLEAR PAP: CLEAR\n\n\nexported functions of the DLL, computes the hash and checks it against the given value. If the hash\nvalues match, the address of the API is returned.\n\n_Figure 27. Function used to locate an API given its hashed value._\n\n[The hashing algorithm used is called FNV-1a for Fowler-Noll-Vo. We were able to reverse the hashes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fowler%E2%80%93Noll%E2%80%93Vo_hash_function)\n[using HashDB. Here is an example for the resolution of VirtualAlloc:](https://hashdb.openanalysis.net/)\n\n_Figure 28. Reversing VirtualAlloc's FNV-1a hash using HashDB._\n\n© I t i\n\n\n-----\n\n## Matanbuchus & Co: Code Emulation and Cybercrime Infrastructure Discovery\n\n TLP: CLEAR PAP: CLEAR\n\n\nBelow is an example of how this function is called: it receives a hash value as parameters, and its result\nis stored in a global variable and returned.\n\n_Figure 29. Use the resolve API function to find the address of VirtualAlloc API._\n\nIn addition to this hashing technique, a different one is used where the name of the API is decrypted\nusing the function analysed above then the address of the API is located using the Export Directory\nTable of the DLL. The function takes the address of the DLL and the decrypted name of the export,\nlocates the Export Directory Table within the DLL, and the iterates over all the exports to find a match.\n[Corkami’s PE102 poster was of great help to identify the different fields of the Export Directory Table.](https://github.com/corkami/pics/blob/669facbb0b6a977f959ae6473b8346e98cf23f53/binary/PE102.png)\n\n_Figure 30. Another technique used by Matanbuchus to resolve APIs dynamically._\n\nTo wrap it up, this sample was heavily obfuscated, we identified:\n\n    - Control flow obfuscation,\n\n    - Debugger and anti-vm traps,\n\n    - API hashing,\n\n    - String encryption.\n\n© I t i\n\n\n-----\n\n## Matanbuchus & Co: Code Emulation and Cybercrime Infrastructure Discovery\n\n TLP: CLEAR PAP: CLEAR\n\n\nWe believe that it has the functionality to load itself by re-downloading in order to call a different\nexport (DllRegisterServer or DllUnregisterServer). Given the exports names, we can assume that it can\nbe launched through regsvr.exe, which would call these exports directly.\n\nAbout network communications, we were able to identify two main functions. One is probably used to\ndownload itself and the other to load additional components. These functions leverage Windows APIs:\n\n    - InterntOpenA\n\n    - InterntOpenUrlA\n\n    - InternetCloseHandle\n\n    - InternetOpenW\n\n    - InternetReadFile\n\n    - InterntOpenUrlW\n\n© I t i\n\n\n-----\n\n## Matanbuchus & Co: Code Emulation and Cybercrime Infrastructure Discovery\n\n TLP: CLEAR PAP: CLEAR\n\n\n### 3. Infrastructure Analysis\n\n3.1. Finding future campaigns with Mihail Kolesnikov\n\nAmong the C2 that were used for the March 7[th] campaign, all domains that had a TLD in “.app” had\nthe value “Mihail Kolesnikov” in the “Registrant Organization” field of their Whois.\n\nBy pivoting on this value, we could find other domains with the same TLD:\n\n  - selevkis[.]app\n\n  - gulappa[.]app\n\n  - musarno[.]app\n\n  - modenetwork[.]app\n\n  - juprewards[.]app\n\n  - blastreward[.]app\n\n  - somakop[.]app\n\n[Some domains like “musarno[.]app” were indeed hosting a Matanbuchus DLL (VirusTotal) and its](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/aa0687832273122eb77be11e11a34bc40f533e38bbbf65262a4bd8fab3987301/)\ncontrol panel. At the time of writing, the domain is currently not detected on VirusTotal with a score\nof 0. This DLL was communicating with another domain “somakop[.]app”, with the same Registrant\nOrganization value in its Whois information.\n\n_Figure 31. Login page of the Matanbuchus control panel hosted on one of the C2._\n\nWe already encountered the name “Mihail Kolesnikov” upon an investigation that we conducted on\nSnatch ransomware and that we shared with our clients the 14[th] of April 3023. Indeed, while\nilluminating the Snatch ransomware backend infrastructure, we found that this pseudonym registered\nhundreds of domains recently. A new domain related to Snatch has been registered since our first\nreport (filesnatchcloud[.]pro).\n\nWe could link a fraction of those domains with medium-high confidence to ICEDID malversing landing\n**domains. Our analysis suggests that the backend infrastructure of Snatch relies on a fast flux service**\nthat frequently rotates IP addresses that we could link to other threats such as the ransomware called\n**RansomEXX but also the Magecart group. It could be used as (DNS) based evasion technique blending**\nthe traffic into a pool of hosts acting as reverse proxies and shielded via bulletproof autonomous\nsystems.\n\n© I t i\n\n\n-----\n\n## Matanbuchus & Co: Code Emulation and Cybercrime Infrastructure Discovery\n\n TLP: CLEAR PAP: CLEAR\n\n\nThe pivot around **“Mihail Kolesnikov” tied to malversing phishing campaigns was then cross-**\ncorrelated by **KrebsonSecurity in a public** [article](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/09/snatch-ransom-group-exposes-visitor-ip-addresses/) dating from September 2023. In this paper, **Brian**\n**Krebs also mentions that “Mihail Kolesnikov” was used to register many phishing websites with the**\nsame TLD “.top and .app […] to mimic the domains of major software companies”. Is also mentioned\nin the same article that many stealers fuelling the top tier Russian speaking ransomware ecosystem\nwere disseminated via such campaigns.\n\nWe could also find that the clear-web version of the Hunters International ransomware group’s DLS\n(huntersinternational[.]org) that recently emerged, was registered with the same name. Rakesh\nKrishnan cross-correlated that link [publicly](https://infosecwriteups.com/identity-of-hunters-international-ransomware-gang-dls-exposed-b287350a707f) the 5th of February 2023, while reporting on potential\n_“persona/fake identity adopted by Hunters International […] with a strong connection to Nigeria”._\n[Sentinelone](https://www.sentinelone.com/anthology/hive/) [stated that Hunter’s international is a reemergence since October 2023 of the defunct](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-department-justice-disrupts-hive-ransomware-variant)\n[Hive ransomware brand. The reverse malware analyst ritvina (@rivitna2)](https://twitter.com/rivitna2/status/1715345562034225621) [substantiated such](https://twitter.com/rivitna2/status/1715345562034225621)\n[statement](https://twitter.com/rivitna2/status/1715345562034225621) by connecting Hive ransomware V6 endowed by [sophisticated hybrid encryption](https://twitter.com/rivitna2/status/1606831626843029504)\n[mechanism](https://twitter.com/rivitna2/status/1606831626843029504) to the one exhibiting Hunter’s international ransom notes. [Bushidotoken assessed that “at](mailto:https://twitter.com/BushidoToken/status/1715368444806275182mailto:@BushidoToken)\n_least 60%” of the code was reused from Hive ransomware. Another indication of such rebrand,_\n[published by Valéry Marchive, is the fact that Hunters international faked its wall of shame records](https://www.lemagit.fr/actualites/366579533/Ransomware-Hunters-International-apparait-recycler-des-donnees-volees-par-Hive)\nwith recycled victims of Hive; this phenomenon is [often encountered](mailto:https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/ransomware-evolution-how-cheated-affiliates-are-recycling-victim-data-for-profit/) in the ransomware ecosystem.\n\nSince “Mihail Kolesnikov” continues to register domains related to various malicious activities,\nfollowing its activities could be used to anticipate the creation of C2 or phishing pages used in future\ncampaigns, as we did with Matanbuchus to preempt ransomware attacks.\n\n3.2. Hosting the Matanbuchus C2s on Russians Bulletproof Autonomous\nSystems\n\nConcerning the C2 hosting infrastructure, the threat actor used two bulletproof hosting services,\n“Chang Way Technologies Co. Limited” (AS57523), registered in Honk-Kong but with servers located\nin Russia, and “Proton66 OOO” (AS198953), registered in Russia with servers located in Russia.\n\n**AS name** **C2 domain** **C2 IP**\n\nChang Way Technologies Co.

Limited”, as it already caught the\n[attention of threat researcher Joshua Penny in a Medium blog post that he wrote in November 2023.](https://medium.com/@joshuapenny88/hostinghunter-series-chang-way-technologies-co-limited-a9ba4fce0f65)\nIn the blog post, Joshua detailed the network infrastructure of the Autonomous Systems and the\nvarious malicious activities that it allowed on its servers. Additionally, he unveiled the two names of\nthe services offering those servers: “BEARHOST” and “UNDERGROUND”, both advertised on\nunderground forums and Telegram.\n\nBelialDemon, the author of Matanbuchus, is indeed a long-time partner of this bulletproof hosting\nservice. In the figure below, he gives excellent feedback on the BEARHOST thread, and also declares\nthat he uses the service for malware hosting.\n\n_Figure 32.Message posted by BelialDemon._\n\nThey had a previous partnership on an older loader project from 2020 operated by BelialDemon and\nnamed “TriumphLoader”. On the thread of the project, BEARHOST stated that they were official\npartners and that all clients of TriumphLoader would get a 10% discount on all the servers offered by\nhis service.\n\n_Figure 33. Message posted by BEARHOST._\n\nWe will instead focus on the second Autonomous System “Proton66 OOO” as we did not find much\nliterature on its activities and infrastructure.\n\n© I t i\n\n\n-----\n\n## Matanbuchus & Co: Code Emulation and Cybercrime Infrastructure Discovery\n\n TLP: CLEAR PAP: CLEAR\n\n\n3.2.1. Proton66 OOO – AS198953\nThe autonomous system was allocated under RIPE on April 6[th], 2023, and is composed of five IPv4\nranges, totalling 1280 IPv4, exclusively attributed to machines located in Saint Petersburg, Russia,\nwhich is also where the company is based.\n\n_Figure 34. Location of open services on the IPs owned by Proton66 OOO according to Shodan._\n\n[The figure below is taken from the bgp.tools](https://bgp.tools/) IPv4 heat map, where each of the blue pixels represents\na responsive IPv4 from their respective range, that was attributed to a server.\n\n_Figure 35. IPv4 ranges owned by Proton66 OOO._\n\n© I t i\n\n\n-----\n\n## Matanbuchus & Co: Code Emulation and Cybercrime Infrastructure Discovery\n\n TLP: CLEAR PAP: CLEAR\n\n\n2021 whois details of the ranges, connection with Resheniya LLC and Unitel LLC:\n\n_Figure 36. List of the IPv4 ranges owned by Proton66 and their respective description from 2021._\n\nCuriously, the MX server “91.226.31[.]34” that registered the domain for the Unitel LLC website\n“unitele[.]ru”, also registered two domains “proton.net[.]ru” and “proton.org[.]ru”. Due to the\nproximity of their name with Proton66, we could assess with low confidence that both Proton66 and\nUnitel LLC are operated by the same entity.\n\n3.2.2. Websites infected with SocGholish\nDuring our investigation, we observed around 400 legitimate websites redirecting to a URL hosting a\nJavaScript file “marvin-occentus[.]net/statistic/js/stat.js” hosted on the Proton66 owned IP,\n“91.212.166[.]21”, and that we believe to be the first stage for a SocGholish infection. For example,\non the figure below, the website on a US-based educational had this specific URL in the source code of\nits main page. The “stat.js” script redirects to the domain “pluralism.themancav[.]com” that is used\nto fingerprint the user’s machine in order for the next stage to be displayed according to the\ninformation gathered by the script. As we described in a previous report regarding this threat, the\nsecond stage of SocGholish consists of fake Chrome or Firefox pages luring the user to update his\nbrowser by downloading an infected JavaScript file.\n\n_Figure 37. Example of a legitimate website hosting a malicious JavaScript used as a first stage for a SocGholish infection._\n\n[Once downloaded, the fake update JavaScript file (VirusTotal) communicates with a pool of domains](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/2d5b7d765f63d1a470c614636d1e5ed3f19ab56e96d0f22d7531fc8bf139341b/relations)\nused as C2s and hosted on the same IP (166.1.173[.]27) as the domain used to display the fake page.\n\n© I t i\n\n\n-----\n\n## Matanbuchus & Co: Code Emulation and Cybercrime Infrastructure Discovery\n\n TLP: CLEAR PAP: CLEAR\n\n\nRegarding the nature of the infected websites, there seems to be no specific sector of choice, as we\nobserved industries of all kinds having their website compromised (see “Indicators of compromise\nsection”). The threat actor seemed to have no guilt about infecting cancer research institutes and other\nhealth related entities with the SocGholish redirector script.\n\n_Figure 38. Websites of cancer research institutes infected with the first stage of SocGholish._\n\nDemocrats’ websites\n\nInterestingly, we found two infected websites belonging to Democrats’ associations in the USA used\nto support upcoming elections. As we cannot clearly prove that they were specifically targeted, we can\nmake the hypothesis with low confidence that **SocGholish could be used for both widespread**\ninfections and more targeted ones.\n\n_Figure 39. Two websites promoting the American Democratic party infected with SocGholish._\n\n© I t i\n\n\n-----\n\n## Matanbuchus & Co: Code Emulation and Cybercrime Infrastructure Discovery\n\n TLP: CLEAR PAP: CLEAR\n\n\nFrance Targeting\n\nSome specific Ips like 193.143[.]1.54 of Proton66 were hosting many phishing pages created with the\nPlesk service that were spoofing packages tracking services like UPS, Chronopost and the French health\nsystem “Ameli”.\n\n_Figure 40. List of domains hosted on a Proton66 owned Ipv4._\n\nThese campaigns are usually sent through SMS spamming and the groups operating those attacks tend\nto be services offered on Telegram.\n\n_Figure 41. Example of an SMS spam campaign targeting France._\n\n# Conclusion\n\nAs Intrinsec’s CTI team observed with the Matanbuchus campaigns, old loaders can still be relevant\nand used by high tier threat actors like the initial access broker TA577. Focusing on the infrastructure,\npart of those attacks can unveil wide networks of different threats as we described with SocGholish\nand the phishing pages hosted with Plesk on seemingly bulletproof Russian hosting services like\nProton66 OOO. Blocking IP ranges from those Autonomous Systems can prevent initial access attempts\nincluding phishing, SEO, watering hole attacks, and further steps of an intrusion like network\ncommunications with potential command-and-control servers.\n\n© I t i\n\n\n-----\n\n## Matanbuchus & Co: Code Emulation and Cybercrime Infrastructure Discovery\n\n TLP: CLEAR PAP: CLEAR\n\n\n# III - Actionable content\n\n### 1.
