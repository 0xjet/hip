Traditional malware designed to run\non all platforms as well as mentorship and hacking services are still\nheavily present. But with time come new innovations—ones that are\nnow gaining popularity among China’s tech-savviest crooks. New\nhardware and channels have gone beyond being mere proofs of concept\n(PoCs) to become the working models driving the cybercrime trends in\nChina today.\n\nWe saw increased Chinese underground activity over a 10-month period.\nChinese-speaking cybercriminals, regardless of nationality, continued\nto abuse popular Web services like the instant-messaging (IM) app, QQ,\nto communicate with peers. Through these channels, they offer botnet\nservices used to instigate distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks along\nwith products like exploit kits.\n\nOur past explorations of the Chinese underground, including their thriving\nmobile underground[2], showed how quickly cybercriminals adapted to\ntechnological advancements and existing trends. 2015 was no different,\nas evidenced by the presence of several recently developed leaked-data\nsearch engines.\n\nWe have also seen the production and sale of new hardware like point-of-\nsale (PoS) and automated teller machine (ATM) skimmers. These come with\ntraining services that teach cybercriminals how to use the said hardware.\nSkimmers like these offer cybercriminals a lucrative business model that\ncan negatively affect small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs).\n\nThe presence of these offerings show just how well the Chinese underground\nhas not only kept up with events in the real world, but how it is also leading\nthe way in terms of cybercriminal innovation. Other markets—especially\nthose in regions with frequent data-breach- or PoS-related cases—may\nsoon follow.\n\n\n-----\n\nSECTION 1\n\n### Leaked-data search engines: Intel gathering made easy  for criminals\n\n\n-----\n\n## Leaked-data search engines: Intel gathering made easy for criminals\n\nThe Deep Web is simply the vast and hidden section of the Internet that is not accessible via search\n\nengines[3]. A huge chunk of the Deep Web deals with cybercriminal activities and illegal services, a part of\n\nwhich has to do with leaked personal data, including addresses and other sensitive information.\n\nThe recent spate of data breaches has resulted in a surplus of data dumps for sale on underground\n\nwebsites[4]. These dumps contain personally identifiable information (PII) and credit card credentials (now\n\nsold in bulk, irrespective of brand). PayPal, poker, and even Uber accounts can now also be found via\n\nleaked-data search engines, a first in the Chinese and other underground markets.\n\nThe data leaked underground allows attackers to commit crimes like financial fraud, identity and intellectual\n\nproperty theft, espionage, and even extortion. Armed with sensitive or potentially damaging information\n\non a politician, for instance, like leaked personal details on an extramarital affair website, a cybercriminal\n\ncan discredit the target who may be lobbying for the approval of, say, the national cybercrime bill.\n\n###### Free search engines and forums\n\nCnSeu (cnseu.pw/) is a forum for trading leaked data. Users buy and sell leaked data using forum coins\n\nor credit points that can be purchased on Alipay with corresponding amounts in RMB (RMB 1 = 10 forum\n\ncoins = ~US$0.16*).\n\n_* Currency exchange rate as of 26 October 2015 was used for all conversions in this paper (US$1 = RMB 6.34)_\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 1: CnSeu provides users a means to communicate with peers_**\n_about various topics related to cybercrime resources, tutorials, and tools_\n\nWhile forums have been keeping cybercriminals connected with one another, they managed to come up\n\nwith even more ways to offer stolen data. SheYun, a search engine specifically created to make leaked\n\ndata available to users, is one such way.\n\n\n**_Figure 2: SheYun’s search database contains leaked data ranging from bank account credentials_**\n_to poker account information; users simply have to provide usernames (输入用户名), QQ details,_\n_and email addresses to avail of its services_\n\n\n-----\n\nSheYun also has a government database that its users can get information from, and ironically, a privacy\nprotection feature for those who wish to prevent certain data from appearing as search results.\n\n**_Figure 3: SheYun users who wish to prevent certain information from appearing as search results_**\n_can avail of its privacy-protection feature, which costs RMB 100 (~US$16) per keyword;_\n_a message saying details are protected by the engine’s protection service (抱歉，此账号已加入SheYun_\n隐私保护服务，详情请看) appears each time keywords pointing to them are used\n\n###### Premium products and services\n\nIn 2013, the most popular Chinese underground offerings were compromised hosts, DDoS attack tools\n\nand services, and remote access Trojans (RATs)[5].\n\nThis year, we discovered new product and service offerings in the Chinese underground. These include\n\nsocial engineering toolkits, comprehensive tool sets required to carry out successful social engineering\n\nattacks.\n\nSocial Engineering Master (社工大师) is one such tool. It allows cybercriminals to search through leaked\n\ndata, send spoofed emails, and create fake IDs using templates, among others, for a meager sum of\n\n~RMB 317 (US$50). Users who access Social Engineering Master are automatically redirected to an\n\nonline payment page if they want to avail of its products and services.\n\n\n**_Figure 3: SheYun users who wish to prevent certain information from appearing as search results_**\n_can avail of its privacy-protection feature, which costs RMB 100 (~US$16) per keyword;_\n_a message saying details are protected by the engine’s protection service (抱歉，此账号已加入SheYun_\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 4: Social Engineering Master’s comprehensive list of features include the ability to obtain_**\n_data (MD5 hashes, PII, and mobile numbers) from dumps, QQ groups, and hotel registers, along with_\n_templates for phishing emails and fake IDs as well as fake WeChat, Alipay, and QQ Wallet balances; it_\n_also comes with exploit kits, phishing websites, and Trojan downloaders, among other cybercrime tools_\n\n**_Figure 5: Social Engineering Master’s main interface contains links to pages where its various features_**\n_(password [查密码], hotel check-in data [开房记录], QQ group data [查Q关系], all other data [查老密], old_\n_password [查老密], and people queries [搜索找人]; social engineering tools [社工搜索]; email-spoofing_\n_templates [邮件发送]; fake government [身份证正反] and online ID creation tools [身份伪造]; a social_\n_engineering dictionary [社工字典]; fake Alipay [支付宝], WeChat [微信], and QQ Wallet [QQ钱包] balance-_\n_modification tools; as well as ready-made exploit kits [网马], QQ Trojans [QQ木马], phishing kits_\n\n_[钓鱼程序], and downloaders [下载者]) can be accessed_\n\n\n**_Figure 4: Social Engineering Master’s comprehensive list of features include the ability to obtain_**\n_data (MD5 hashes, PII, and mobile numbers) from dumps, QQ groups, and hotel registers, along with_\n_templates for phishing emails and fake IDs as well as fake WeChat, Alipay, and QQ Wallet balances; it_\n_also comes with exploit kits, phishing websites, and Trojan downloaders, among other cybercrime tools_\n\n\n-----\n\nApart from SheYun, paid engines that allow users to search for cybercriminal offerings also abound.\n\nPassBase is one example of such.\n\n**_Figure 6: Using PassBase costs RMB 68 (~US$11) per year; its home page warns users_**\n_about using dangerous query search terms (请不要使用危险字符查询)_\n\n**_Figure 7: TuoMiMa’s service also costs RMB 68 (~US$11)_**\n_to access its database of dumps, much like SheYun’s_\n\n\n**_Figure 6: Using PassBase costs RMB 68 (~US$11) per year; its home page warns users_**\n_about using dangerous query search terms (请不要使用危险字符查询)_\n\n\n-----\n\nSECTION 2\n\n### Carding: Ever-thriving  criminal enterprise backed  by innovation\n\n\n-----\n\n## Carding: Ever-thriving criminal enterprise backed by innovation\n\nThe noncash transaction volume in China has drastically grown over the past two years, made apparent\n\nby the adoption of electronic and mobile payment means. Alongside countries in the “emerging Asia”\n\ngroup[6], China is expected to register a 27% noncash payment growth rate, driven by increased Internet\n\nuse and mobile payment transactions.\n\nCybercriminals quickly jumped on the noncash payment bandwagon. They now offer carding devices like\n\nPoS and ATM skimmers to interested buyers at fairly reasonable prices.\n\nDespite the development of mobile payment systems as PoS terminal alternatives, most SMBs still favor\n\nthe use of PoS systems for receiving payment. SMBs have thus become easy carding scheme targets.\n\nCarding has to do with unsavory forums and websites involved in the increasingly regimented process of\n\nstealing and laundering credit card information[7].\n\nVarious publicly accessible websites sell PoS, ATM, and credit card pocket skimmers. Skimmers refer to\n\ndevices that extract data from payment card magnetic strips[8]. In a previously published in-depth study\n\nof PoS malware[9], we said skimmers cannot be readily mass deployed for maximum effectiveness; the\n\nChinese underground has now proven otherwise.\n\nCredit card fraud made headlines in February last year, when an individual from Hangzhou was tried\n\nin the United States (US) for a successful spam run[10] that cost card providers roughly RMB 5,130,000\n\n(~US$808,855).\n\n\n-----\n\n###### PoS skimmers\n\nWe found PoS skimmers on the business-to-business (B2B) e-commerce site, 1688.com. These devices\n\nwere bought by retailers who then resell them to small businesses that are always on the lookout for the\n\nmost reasonable prices. These resellers may or may not know that the gadgets they are peddling have\n\nbeen tampered with.\n\nManufacturer/ Reseller sells the Retailer sells goods Customer pays for\nCybercriminal sells device bought to to a customer. goods bought via a\nthe tampered device a retailer. credit card; ends up\nto a reseller. getting his/her card\n\ninformation stolen.\n\nCredit card information goes to the cybercriminal.\n\n**_Figure 8: Typical modus operandi that PoS skimmer sellers use_**\n\n**_Figure 9: PoS skimmers are sold for RMB 5,000 (~US$788) each on lzise.com;_**\n_the site is run by a cybercriminal who specializes in selling customized PoS terminals_\n_that look no different from those that have not been tampered with, but come with a_\n_special chip that allows criminals to authorize otherwise unauthorized purchases_\n\n\n-----\n\nSome of the PoS skimmers sold underground even have an SMS-notification feature. This allows\n\ncybercriminals to instantly get their hands on stolen data via SMS every time the tampered devices are\n\nused. Cybercriminals do not even have to physically collect stolen information from installed devices,\n\nallowing them greater flexibility and convenience. They can also more easily expand their operational\n\nscope by merely installing their skimmers into more PoS devices across stores, countries, and even\n\nregions.\n\nSuch was the case that made the news just this August[11]. A company reportedly sold the modified devices\n\nto a number of small restaurants and hotels. Investigators found 1,100 sets of stolen card information\n\nstored in the company’s servers. Despite the small number of stolen credit card records, the scammers\n\nwere still able to cost victims a fairly significant amount—RMB 1.5 million (~US$236,507).\n\n**_Figure 10: PoS skimmer with an SMS-notification feature sold for RMB 8,000 (~US$1,261)_**\n_on 1688.com; the device has been modified to allow cybercriminals to instantly receive_\n_credit card numbers (including card verification values [CVVs]) via SMS when used_\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 11: Even chip-and-personal identification number (PIN) card users are unsafe, as some PoS_**\n_skimmers come with PIN pad skimmers that also have SMS-notification features_\n\n**_Figure 12: PoS skimmers with SMS-notification features instantly send stolen data_**\n_in the format shown above (PIN and credit card number) to cybercriminals_\n\n\n-----\n\n###### ATM skimmers\n\nIn March 2014, we saw a cybercriminal produce and sell ATM skimmers and fake PoS terminals in several\n\nunderground forums[12]. These fraud-enabling devices reportedly originated from China. The sale of such\n\ndevices continued and thrived. What is more worrisome though is that our fear then—that mass production\n\nof fraud-enabling devices could very well ensue—has seemingly come true.\n\n**_Figure 13: ATM skimmers cost RMB 4,000 (~US$631) each; these came installed with a microchip_**\n_that records payment card track data or the confidential information stored on a card’s_\n_magnetic strip, along with a microcamera that allows cybercriminals to obtain a victim’s PIN_\n\nATM PIN skimmers are also commonly sold on B2B websites, offering cybercriminals more ways to\n\nsuccessfully carry out bank fraud and actual theft. For a sum of RMB 2,000 (~US$315), fraudsters can\n\nuse these as keypad overlays in order to more effectively steal victims’ PINs. These come with a small\n\nmemory chip that saves all captured PINs that cybercriminals can physically retrieve in order to gather the\n\ninformation they need to complete their fraudulent acts.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 14: ATM PIN skimmer sold on the e-commerce website, lzise.com, for RMB 2,000 (~US$315)_**\n\n###### Pocket skimmers\n\nMass-produced pocket skimmers come in handy for crooks who do not wish to physically tamper with\n\nATMs and PoS terminals in order to steal. These are small and so easily go unnoticed. An unscrupulous\n\nstore staff member can, for instance, swipe an unwitting customer’s card on a pocket skimmer in order to\n\nsteal track data that he/she can later use for fraud.\n\n**_Figure 15: Pocket skimmers are sold for RMB 900 (~US$142) on 1688.com’s digital appliances section_**\n\n\n-----\n\nPocket skimmers are small magnetic card readers that can store track data from up to 2,048 payment\n\ncards. They do not need to physically be connected to a computer in order to work. They do not even\n\nrequire an external power supply and can read the data stored on the magnetic strip of any kind of credit\n\ncard. All stored information can then be downloaded onto a connected computer.\n\n**PoS skimmers**\n\nCan come equipped with an SMS-notification feature\nthat instantly sends stolen data to cybercriminals\n\n**ATM skimmers**\n\nHave two components that allow cybercriminals to\nsteal victims’ card data and PINs\n\n**Pocket skimmers**\n\nPortable card readers that capture all of the data\nstored in the magnetic strip of payment cards\n\n**_Figure 16: Skimmers produced and sold in the Chinese underground_**\n\n###### Skimmer tutorials and materials\n\nHardware specially made to instigate crime are not the only offerings in the Chinese underground. Training\n\nservices and materials that would-be cybercriminals can make use of also abound.\n\nWe found underground dealings in phpBB, an open source forum where users traded information\n\non carding device training and materials. Aided by our Deep Web Analyzer[13], we were able to locate\n\nTor文交流论坛, a website on The Onion Router (TOR) where the phpBB forum was hosted. Access to TOR\n\nis blocked in China so the network is hardly used. But since carding has become such a hot commodity\n\nin the country, related products and services have cropped up in TOR sites.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 17: Forum post where carding courses are offered in exchange for bitcoins_**\n_(2BTC [~US$569.58] ** per “bible,” a guide to carding, that will made available in_\n\n_two weeks’ time; buyers are guaranteed to get returns on their investment after_\n_a week or two); discounts are offered to previous customers; ads for domestic_\n_and international credit card track data are also seen_\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 18: Forum post that offers the “Alpha02 CARDING Christmas Version (学院圣诞版)” bible, which_**\n_teaches users to use carding hardware and software for 0.3BTC (~US$85.44; 50% off discounted rate)_\n\nSimilar offerings that can be used to abuse Internet of Things (IoT) devices can also be seen in the\n\nChinese underground. Readily available devices and knowledge shared in anonymous forums will usher\n\nin a new wave of more skilled and confident cybercriminals in China.\n\n\n-----\n\nSECTION 3\n\n### Market offerings:  As robust as they are unique\n\n\n-----\n\n## Market offerings:  As robust as they are unique\n\nSince 2012, we have been providing updated lists of the products and services peddled in the Chinese\n\nunderground. These offerings are available to any enterprising criminal from anywhere in the world.\n\nMost of the wares we spotted were designed to target Chinese citizens. Americans, Europeans, and the\n\nJapanese may experience monetary losses as well since credit card dumps from their countries are also\n\nsold in the Chinese underground. Local cybercriminals can either use the credit card data for their own\n\npersonal gain or sell them to other buyers.\n\nWe also noted that bulletproof hosting still plays a significant role in Chinese cybercriminal marketplace.\n\nSeveral local phishing sites as well as sites that sell counterfeit wares all rely on these hosting services\n\nto stay up. It’s also possible that leaked-data search engines use such services to store the data dumps.\n\nTake a look at the Chinese underground’s latest offerings with updated prices from 2013 to 2014 or 2015.\n\n###### Services\n\nNote that prices in green text under the 2014–2015 column indicate increases while those in blue indicate\n\ndecreases.\n\n|Service|Details|2013 price|2014–2015 price|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Apple App Store app-rank boosting|Into the top 25 free apps list|US$3,400|US$7,248|\n||Into the top 50 free apps list|US$2,300|US$4,097|\n||Into the top 100 free apps list|US$980|US$2,521|\n||Into the top 150 free apps list||US$1,891|\n||Into the top 5 paid apps list|US$9,800|US$4,097|\n||Into the top 10 paid apps list|US$6,400|US$3,466|\n||Into the top 25 paid apps list|US$3,400|US$2,836|\n\n\n-----\n\n|Service|Details|2013 price|2014–2015 price|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Botnet rental|With 100 Windows 2003 or 2008 bots|US$48|US$24|\n|Carding tutorial|||US$0.30–570|\n|Cracking|Encrypted .RAR, .ZIP, .DOC, .XLS, and .EXE files|US$45|US$44|\n||Protected dongles|US$807–12,919|US$788–12,605|\n||Software registration codes|US$161|US$158|\n||Software user-number limitations|US$242|US$236|\n|DDoS attack|100Mbps; 100–2,000 bots (monthly subscription)|US$95–596|US$79|\n|Dedicated server hosting|With DDoS protection (monthly subscription)|US$81–775|US$284–10,669|\n|Document copy rework||US$19|US$19|\n|Email spamming|20,000 email addresses|US$161|US$47|\n||50,000 email addresses|US$323|US$95|\n|Hacking|QQ and WeChat accounts|US$48–129|US$79|\n||Personal email accounts|US$48|US$47|\n||Corporate email accounts|US$81|US$95|\n||Sina Weibo accounts|US$48|US$63|\n|iMessage® spamming|20,000 messsages||US$205|\n||50,000 messages||US$433|\n||80,000 messages||US$630|\n|Privacy protection on leaked-data search engines|||US$11–16|\n|Programming|RAT toolkits|US$161|US$158|\n||Trojans|US$323–8,075|US$315–7,878|\n|Proxy server hosting|Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), HTTP Secure (HTTPS), or Socket Secure (SOCKS) (monthly subscription)|US$0.16–16|US$15|\n|Security software checking|Makes sure malware are not detected by security software|US$13–19|US$13–19|\n\n\n-----\n\n|Service|Details|2013 price|2014–2015 price|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|SMS spamming|10,000 text messages||US$126|\n||80,000 text messages||US$882|\n||100,000 text messages||US$945|\n|Trojan toolkit access|Fengtian remote access toolkit (monthly subscription)||US$47|\n||MBZ remote access Toolkit (annual subscription)||US$95|\n|Virtual private network (VPN) server hosting|Monthly subscription|US$3|US$3|\n\n\n###### Products\n\nNote that prices in green text under the 2014–2015 column indicate increases while those in blue indicate\n\ndecreases.\n\n|Product|Details|2013 price|2014–2015 price|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|ATM PIN skimmers|||US$315|\n|ATM skimmers|||US$1,261|\n|Banking credential packages|Includes ATM cards, IDs, dongle passwords, and subscriber identity module (SIM) cards||US$126–158|\n|Fake websites|QQ, TaoBao Bank of China, and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC)|US$81|US$79|\n||Various online games|US$16–32|US$16–32|\n||Online game trading sites|US$81–97|US$79–95|\n|Leaked data packages|||US$0.16|\n|Local third-party app (for Android™) popularity boosters|10,000 downloads|US$7|US$8–16|\n||100 comments||US$32|\n|Pocket skimmers|||US$142|\n|PoS skimmers|||US$788|\n|Scanned fake documents|Chinese, US, and Canadian passports|US$5|US$5|\n\n\n-----\n\n|Product|Details|2013 price|2014–2015 price|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Serial keys|Windows® 10 Pro||US$2|\n||Microsoft™ Office® 2016||US$6|\n||AutoCAD® 2015||US$12|\n|Sina Weibo popularity boosters|10,000 followers||US$7–161|\n||5,000 tweets||US$55|\n||1,000 comments||US$8–63|\n||5,000 votes (for awards, maybe)||US$55–79|\n|Social engineering toolkits|||US$50|\n|Traffic|500 Internet Protocol (IP) addresses per day|US$0.26|US$0.25|\n||1,000 IP addresses per day|US$0.42|US$0.41|\n||5,000 IP addresses per day|US$2|US$2|\n||10,000 IP addresses per day|US$5|US$5|\n||50,000 IP addresses per day|US$38|US$37|\n||100,000 IP addresses per day|US$95|US$92|\n||500,000 IP addresses per day|US$473|US$462|\n|Trojans|QQ account stealers|US$32|US$32|\n||TaoBao account stealers|US$323|US$315|\n\n\n-----\n\n###### References\n\n1.
