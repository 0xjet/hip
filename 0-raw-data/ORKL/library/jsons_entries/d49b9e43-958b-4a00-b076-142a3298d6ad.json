They went\nafter employees of the victim organizations with spearphishing emails, which were used to\ninstall backdoor tools for remote access to networks, according to the indictment. After\nlocating the information they wanted to steal, Wang and Doe allegedly extracted the data by\nbundling it in encrypted archiving files and then routing the data through multiple computers\nback to China.\n\nIn the case of Anthem, Wang and Doe bided their time in devising their attack, according to\nprosecutors, surveying the health insurer’s enterprise data center, which housed the PII,\nthroughout October and November 2014.\n\nMatt Gorham, assistant director of the FBI’s Cyber Division, credited the\ncommunication between victim organizations and the bureau in tracking down the alleged\nculprits.\n\n“Because the victim companies promptly notified the FBI of malicious cyber activity, we were\nable to successfully investigate and identify the perpetrators of this large-scale, highly\nsophisticated scheme,” Gorham said in a statement.\n\nAn Anthem spokesperson could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\n\n-----",
