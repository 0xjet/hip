The\nfollowing industries have been observed being targeted thus far:\n\nNGOs\nResearch Institutions\nGovernment Agencies\nInternational Agencies\n\nThe campaign’s phishing e-mails purported to originate from the USAID government agency and contained a malicious link that resulted in an\nISO file being delivered. This file contained a malicious LNK file, a malicious DLL file, and a legitimate lure referencing foreign threats to the\n2020 US Federal Elections.\n\nThis blog post provides details on the observed activity and outlines possible justification that this campaign could be related to APT29.\n\n## Phishing Email Campaign\n\nThe original e-mails looked like the following:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1. Phishing e-mails sent to numerous organizations_\n\nVolexity also observed a smaller campaign from the same sender with largely the same content several hours earlier, but with the subject line\n\"USAID Special Alert!\". Most of the hyperlinks in the e-mail are of the following format.\n\nhttps://r20.rs6[.]net/tn.jsp?\nf=001R6x5duwxLa513iT3wolVtyZj3Ojypr9nwPwZKB3X68SGRFzUVNUR4MdENUXj_c4poo1hx_rFF79P1NsazEFONIrA9G0ypkCwKTRfL95fp3xUyuceYYrPAtcDp20R1wmw-XZ197ks1FH22V3BIcZYlAfIHdUZQ3M&c=[Random Data]&ch=[Random\nData]&__=[Victim Email]\n\nWhile each link was consistent in a given e-mail, parts of the e-mail varied.\n\nThe “rs6.net” domain is used by Constant Contact e-mail marketing software to track click-throughs on links, meaning the attacker should be\nable to map the success of their campaign. On the newsletter page of USAID's website, their sign-up link is through Constant Contact. As a\nresult of using this software, the attacker is able to generate a more convincing spear-phish e-mail. Additionally, the e-mail appears to originate\n[from USAID; however, news-related e-mails from this organization are traditionally sent via the [email protected] e-mail address.](https://www.volexity.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)\n\nWhen a recipient clicks the Constant Contact URL referenced above, their network request will be redirected to the following URL:\n\nhttps://usaid.theyardservice[.]com/d/[Victim Email]\n\nThis network request will initiate a download for the malicious ISO file “ICA-declass.iso” to the victim's system. The same file is delivered to\nevery user irrespective of their e-mail or referring URL.\n\n## Delivered Malware\n\nThe malware in question is provided as an ISO file, which acts as a container for embedded files. This ISO has the following properties:\n\n\n-----\n\n**SHA1** bf7b36c521e52093360a4df0dd131703b7b3d648\n\n**Modification Date** 2021:05:25 13:37:24-04:00\n\n**Volume Name** ICA_DECLASS\n\nISO files are similar to archives and can contain several embedded files. They have been popular with criminal threat actors as alternatives to\nZIP and RAR files for some time. The following files were present within the ISO:\n\n**Filename** **SHA1 Hash**\n\nICA-declass.pdf 738c20a2cc825ae51b2a2f786248f850c8bab6f5\n\nReports.lnk 1cb1c2cd9f59d4e83eb3c950473a772406ec6f1a\n\nDocuments.dll 1fb12e923bdb71a1f34e98576b780ab2840ba22e\n\n[The PDF file appears to have been pulled directly from the dni.gov website and acts as a decoy; its contents are shown in Figure 2.](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/reports-publications/reports-publications-2021/item/2192-intelligence-community-assessment-on-foreign-threats-to-the-2020-u-s-federal-elections)\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2. PDF lure included within the malware_\n\nIf a user opened the embedded LNK file, it would run the Document.dll file and use its exported function “Open”.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3. Parsed LNK file embedded within ISO_\n\nIt should be noted that nearly all of the metadata from the LNK file has been removed. Typically, LNK files contain timestamps for creation,\nmodification, and access, as well as information about the device on which they were created.\n\nThe DLL included in the ISO has the following attributes:\n\n**SHA1 Hash** 1fb12e923bdb71a1f34e98576b780ab2840ba22e\n\n**Filename** Document.dll\n\n**Compile Timestamp** 2019-04-27 18:24:28 UTC\n\n**File Type** PE32+ executable (DLL) (GUI) x86-64, for MS Windows\n\n**PDB String** C:\\Users\\dev\\Desktop\\나타나게 하다\\Dll6\\x64\\Release\\Dll6.pdb\n\nWhile the PDB string contains the Korean word for “develop,” Volexity does not believe Korean-speaking threat actors or developers are\nresponsible for this malware family. Volexity instead believes this to be a false flag. Additionally, the compile timestamp dating to the year 2019\nis likely to have been falsified.\n\nThe DLL is equipped with a number of anti-sandbox and anti-vm checks based on the presence of registry keys commonly found in Virtual\nMachine environments, as shown in Figure 4:\n\n_Figure 4. Decompiled virtual machine checks found within the malicious DLL_\n\n\n-----\n\nte t ese c ec s a e passed, t e a a e de ob uscates a pay oad by pp g t e o de o bytes t t O ce de ob uscated, t e pay oad\nis executed within the same process.

This malware\nfamily, which Volexity has named \"FRESHFIRE\", uses specific attributes on the infected hostname to decrypt and execute data received from\na remote C2 server.\n\nThis second-stage DLL has the following attributes:\n\n**SHA1 Hash** 38c99e8cd95f28b8d79b758cb940cf139e09f6ae\n\n**Filename** DbgView.dll\n\n**Compile Timestamp** 2021:05:25 9:32:14 UTC\n\n**File Type** PE32+ executable (DLL) (Console) x86-64, for MS Windows\n\n**Original Filename** goog.dll\n\nThe exported function \"WaitPrompt\" of this DLL launches the malicious behavior. The malware begins by attempting to open a mutex with the\nname \"UlswcXJJWhtHIHrVqWJJ\". If this mutex already exists on the system the malware will exit, otherwise it will proceed. The malware then\nqueries the file attributes of the file \"C:\\dell.sdr\" and appends data from these file attributes to the above mutex name. This combined string is\nthen hashed with MD5 and used to generate a Triple DES decryption key.\n\nFigure 5. Encryption routine leveraged by the malware\n\n[The sample then uploads a timestamp to Firebase and downloads a blob from Firebase storage. This data is base64 decoded and decrypted](https://firebase.google.com/)\nusing the generated key. Then, the data is executed in a separate thread, and an HTTP DELETE request is sent to the Firebase storage\naddress used to download the payload.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6. Decryption routine used to decrypt the remote payload\n\nThe following URLs are observed in use by this malware:\n```\n   refreshauthtoken-default-rtdb.firebaseio[.]com/root/time/%d/%s.json\n   refreshauthtoken-default-rtdb.firebaseio[.]com/root/data/%d/%s.json\n\n```\nVolexity was able to capture an encrypted payload from the Firebase URL and are currently in the process of analyzing it.\n\n## Attribution\n\nWhile Volexity cannot say with certainty who is behind these attacks, it does believe it has the earmarks of a known threat actor it has dealt\nwith on several previous occasions. However, a number of attack attributes are consistent with previous tactics used by APT29:\n\nThe use of an [archive file format containing an LNK to deliver the initial payload (2018)](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2018/11/not-so-cozy-an-uncomfortable-examination-of-a-suspected-apt29-phishing-campaign.html)\nThe use of a [US election-themed lure document sent from a spoofed US government source address (2016)](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/2d2fa32f928f8abf31b9e79153422d65fe72cd5ad0d1f815a9d2ffa42fc8d224/relations)\nThe use of [CobaltStrike with a custom malleable profile as an initial payload (2018)](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2018/11/not-so-cozy-an-uncomfortable-examination-of-a-suspected-apt29-phishing-campaign.html)\nThe relatively widespread nature of the campaign, with many targets receiving the same spear phishing content at the same time\n\nNotably, in the 2018 case, FireEye highlighted the same MAC address had been used to create the LNKs observed in 2016 and 2018, while\nthe newest LNK detailed in this blog post has had this metadata scrubbed. This is perhaps an indication that the attacker is learning from\npublic reports on their work.\n\nFrom an infrastructure point of view, the domains used bear some similarity to the Dark Halo campaign reported by Volexity. In the case of\nDark Halo, domains were bought at auction or through marketplace transactions which meant they appeared to be created long ago in WHOIS\nrecords. This is the case again with the domains used for command and control in these attacks. Following the Volexity publication, it has been\nalleged that the Dark Halo campaign was also the work of APT29; however, Volexity has not reached that conclusion at this time.\nVolexity cannot be completely certain this new activity is the work of APT29, but it is believed with moderate confidence that it is.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nVolexity believes the APT29 threat actor is likely responsible for a phishing campaign against numerous organizations within the United States\nand Europe. It is currently unclear how many organizations have been targeted, but several of Volexity's customers—as well as a number of\norganizations submitting to VirusTotal—have been attacked.\n\nAfter a relatively long hiatus with no publicly detailed spear phishing activity, APT29 appears to have returned with only slight changes to its\nhistorical TTPs. In this instance, the attacker purports to be from USAID, enticing victims into clicking an embedded file to download and\nexecute a malicious ISO file. In doing so, the CobaltStrike Beacon implant is executed, providing remote access to the attackers.\n\nAt the time of writing, all files involved have relatively low static detection rates on VirusTotal. This suggests the attacker is likely having some\nsuccess in breaching targets.\n\nOrganizations are encouraged to perform the following actions to protect against this threat:\n\nBlock the following network indicators identified as part of this phishing campaign:\n\ntheyardservice[.]com\nworldhomeoutlet[.]com\n83.171.237.173\n192.99.221.77\nrefreshauthtoken-default-rtdb[.]firebaseio.com\nRefer to the Appendix for a list of file hashes that may be used for blocking\nUse the provided YARA rules in the Appendix to detect the malware observed in this blog post\n\n## Appendix A - YARA Rules\n\n\n-----\n\nu e apt_ _ p op_ d 9\n{\n\nmeta:\n\n[author = \"[email protected]\"](https://www.volexity.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)\ndate = \"2021-05-25\"\ndescription = \"A loader for the CobaltStrike malware family, which ultimately takes the first and second bytes of an embedded file, and\nflips them prior to executing the resulting payload.\"\nhash = \"ee42ddacbd202008bcc1312e548e1d9ac670dd3d86c999606a3a01d464a2a330\"\n\nstrings:\n\n$s1 = \"irnjadle\"\n$s2 = \"BADCFEHGJILKNMPORQTSVUXWZY\"\n$s3 = \"iMrcsofo taBesC yrtpgoarhpciP orived r1v0.\"\n\ncondition:\n\nall of ($s*)\n\n}\n\nrule trojan_win_cobaltstrike : Commodity\n{\n\nmeta:\n\n[author = \"[email protected]\"](https://www.volexity.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)\ndate = \"2021-05-25\"\ndescription = \"The CobaltStrike malware family.\"\nhash = \"b041efb8ba2a88a3d172f480efa098d72eef13e42af6aa5fb838e6ccab500a7c\"\n\nstrings:\n\n$s1 = \"%s (admin)\" fullword\n$s2 = {48 54 54 50 2F 31 2E 31 20 32 30 30 20 4F 4B 0D 0A 43 6F 6E 74 65 6E 74 2D 54 79 70 65 3A 20 61 70 70 6C 69 63 61 74 69\n6F 6E 2F 6F 63 74 65 74 2D 73 74 72 65 61 6D 0D 0A 43 6F 6E 74 65 6E 74 2D 4C 65 6E 67 74 68 3A 20 25 64 0D 0A 0D 0A 00}\n$s3 = \"%02d/%02d/%02d %02d:%02d:%02d\" fullword\n$s4 = \"%s as %s\\\\%s: %d\" fullword\n$s5 = \"%s&%s=%s\" fullword\n$s6 = \"rijndael\" fullword\n$s7 = \"(null)\"\n\ncondition:\n\nall of them\n\n}\n\nimport \"pe\"\n\nrule apt_win_freshfire : APT29\n{\n\nmeta:\n\n[author = \"[email protected]\"](https://www.volexity.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)\ndate = \"2021-05-27\"\ndescription = \"The FRESHFIRE malware family.
