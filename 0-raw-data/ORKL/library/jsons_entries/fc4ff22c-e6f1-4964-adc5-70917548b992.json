This actor has engaged in prolific spear phishing of government\nand defense entities in Central and Southwest Asia. The spear phishing emails and attached malicious macro documents\ntypically have geopolitical themes. When successfully executed, the malicious documents install a backdoor we track as\nPOWERSTATS.\n\nOne of the more interesting observations during the analysis of these files was the re-use of the latest AppLocker bypass,\nand lateral movement techniques for the purpose of indirect code execution. The IP address in the lateral movement\ntechniques was substituted with the local machine IP address to achieve code execution on the system.\n\n**Campaign Timeline**\n\n\n-----\n\nIn this campaign, the threat actor s tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) shifted after about a month, as did their\ntargets. A brief timeline of this activity is shown in Figure 1.\n\n\nTimeline of this recently observed spear phishing campaign\n\n\nFigure 1: Timeline of this recently\n\nobserved spear phishing campaign\nThe first part of the campaign (From Jan. 23, 2018, to Feb. 26, 2018) used a macro-based document that dropped a VBS\nfile and an INI file. The INI file contains the Base64 encoded PowerShell command, which will be decoded and executed\nby PowerShell using the command line generated by the VBS file on execution using WScript.exe. The process chain is\nshown in Figure 2.\n\n\n-----\n\nProcess chain for the first part of the campaign\n\n\nFigure 2: Process chain for the\n\nfirst part of the campaign\nAlthough the actual VBS script changed from sample to sample, with different levels of obfuscation and different ways of\ninvoking the next stage of process tree, its final purpose remained same: invoking PowerShell to decode the Base64\nencoded PowerShell command in the INI file that was dropped earlier by the macro, and executing it. One such example\nof the VBS invoking PowerShell via MSHTA is shown in Figure 3.\n\n\n-----\n\nVBS invoking PowerShell via MSHTA\n\n\nFigure 3: VBS invoking\n\nPowerShell via MSHTA\nThe second part of the campaign (from Feb. 27, 2018, to March 5, 2018) used a new variant of the macro that does not\nuse VBS for PowerShell code execution. Instead, it uses one of the recently disclosed code execution techniques\nleveraging INF and SCT files, which we will go on to explain later in the blog.\n\n**Infection Vector**\n\nWe believe the infection vector for all of the attacks involved in this campaign are macro-based documents sent as an\nemail attachment. One such email that we were able to obtain was targeting users in Turkey, as shown in Figure 4.\n\n\n-----\n\nSample spear phishing email containing macro-based document attachment\n\n\nFigure 4: Sample spear phishing\n\nemail containing macro-based document attachment\nThe malicious Microsoft Office attachments that we observed appear to have been specially crafted for individuals in four\ncountries: Turkey, Pakistan, Tajikistan and India. What follows is four examples, and a complete list is available in the\nIndicators of Compromise section at the end of the blog.\n\nFigure 5 shows a document purporting to be from the National Assembly of Pakistan.\n\n\n-----\n\nDocument purporting to be from the National Assembly of Pakistan\n\n\nFigure 5: Document purporting to\n\nbe from the National Assembly of Pakistan\nA document purporting to be from the Turkish Armed Forces, with content written in the Turkish language, is shown in\nFigure 6.\n\n\n-----\n\nDocument purporting to be from the Turkish Armed Forces\n\n\nFigure 6: Document purporting to\n\nbe from the Turkish Armed Forces\nA document purporting to be from the Institute for Development and Research in Banking Technology (established by the\nReserve Bank of India) is shown in Figure 7.\n\n\n-----\n\nDocument purporting to be from the Institute for Development and Research in\nBanking Technology\n\nFigure 7: Document purporting to\n\nbe from the Institute for Development and Research in Banking Technology\nFigure 8 shows a document written in Tajik that purports to be from the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of\nTajikistan.\n\n\n-----\n\nDocument written in Tajik that purports to be from the Ministry of Internal Affairs of\nthe Republic of Tajikistan\n\nFigure 8: Document written in\n\nTajik that purports to be from the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Tajikistan\nEach of these macro-based documents used similar techniques for code execution, persistence and communication with\nthe command and control (C2) server.\n\n**Indirect Code Execution Through INF and SCT**\n\nThis [scriptlet code execution technique leveraging INF and SCT files was recently discovered and documented in](https://bohops.com/2018/02/26/leveraging-inf-sct-fetch-execute-techniques-for-bypass-evasion-persistence/)\nFebruary 2018. The threat group in this recently observed campaign – TEMP.Zagros – weaponized their malware using\nthe following techniques.\n\nThe macro in the Word document drops three files in a hard coded path: C:\\programdata. Since the path is hard coded,\nthe execution will only be observed in operating systems, Windows 7 and above. The following are the three files:\n\n**Defender.sct – The malicious JavaScript based scriptlet file.**\n**DefenderService.inf – TheINF file that is used to invoke the above scriptlet file.**\n**WindowsDefender.ini – The Base64 encoded and obfuscated PowerShell script.**\n\nAfter dropping the three files, the macro will set the following registry key to achieve persistence:\n\n**\\REGISTRY\\USER\\SID\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersio**\n\n**n\\Run\\\"WindowsDefenderUpdater\" = cmstp.exe /s c:\\programdata\\DefenderService.inf**\n\nUpon system restart, cmstp.exe will be used to execute the SCT file indirectly through the INF file. This is possible\nbecause inside the INF file we have the following section:\n\n[UnRegisterOCXSection]\n\n%11%\\scrobj.dll,NI,c:/programdata/Defender.sct\n\nThat section gets indirectly invoked through the DefaultInstall_SingleUser section of INF, as shown in Figure 9.\n\n\n-----\n\nIndirectly invoking SCT through the DefaultInstall_SingleUser section of INF\n\n\nFigure 9: Indirectly invoking SCT\n\nthrough the DefaultInstall_SingleUser section of INF\nThis method of code execution is performed in an attempt to evade security products. FireEye MVX and HX Endpoint\nSecurity technology successfully detect this code execution technique.\n\n**SCT File Analysis**\n\nThe code of the Defender.sct file is an obfuscated JavaScript. The main function performed by the SCT file is to Base64\ndecode the contents of WindowsDefender.ini file and execute the decoded PowerShell Script using the following\ncommand line:\n\npowershell.exe -exec Bypass -c\niex([System.Text.Encoding]::Unicode.GetString([System.Convert]::FromBase64String((get-content\nC:\\\\ProgramData\\\\WindowsDefender.ini)\n\nThe rest of the malicious activities are performed by the PowerShell Script.\n\n**PowerShell File Analysis**\n\nThe PowerShell script employs several layers of obfuscation to hide its actual functionality. In addition to obfuscation\ntechniques, it also has the ability to detect security tools on the analysis machine, and can also shut down the system if it\ndetects the presence of such tools.\n\nSome of the key obfuscation techniques used are:\n\n**Character Replacement: Several instances of character replacement and string reversing techniques (Figure 10)**\nmake analysis difficult.\n\n\n-----\n\nCharacter replacement and string reversing techniques\n\n\nFigure 10: Character replacement\n\nand string reversing techniques\n\n**PowerShell Environment Variables: Nowadays, malware authors commonly mask critical strings such as “IEX”**\nusing environment variables. Some of the instances used in this script are:\n\n$eNv:puBLic[13]+$ENv:pUBLIc[5]+'x'\n($ENV:cOMsPEC[4,26,25]-jOin'')\n**XOR encoding: The biggest section of the PowerShell script is XOR encoded using a single byte key, as shown in**\nFigure 11.\n\n\n-----\n\nPowerShell script is XOR encoded using a single byte key\n\n\nFigure 11: PowerShell script is\n\nXOR encoded using a single byte key\nAfter deobfuscating the contents of the PowerShell Script, we can divide it into three sections.\n\nSection 1\n\nThe first section of the PowerShell script is responsible for setting different key variables that are used by the remaining\nsections of the PowerShell script, especially the following variables:\n\nTEMpPAtH = \"C:\\ProgramData\\\" (the path used for storing the temp files)\nGet_vAlIdIP = [https://api.ipify.org/ (used to get the public IP address of the machine)](https://api.ipify.org/)\nFIlENAmePATHP = WindowsDefender.ini (file used to store Powershell code)\nPRIVAtE = Private Key exponents\nPUbLIc = Public Key exponents\nHklm = \"HKLM:\\Software\\\"\nHkcu = \"HKCU:\\Software\\\"\nValuE = \"kaspersky\"\nSYSID\nDrAGon_MidDLe = [array of proxy URLs]\n\nAmong those variables, there is one variable of particular interest, DrAGon_MidDLe, which stores the list of proxy URLs\n(detailed at the end of the blog in the Network Indicators portion of the Indicators of Compromise section) that will be used\nto interact with the C2 server, as shown in Figure 12.\n\n\n-----\n\nDrAGon_MidDLe stores the list of proxy URLs used to interact with C2 server\n\n\nFigure 12: DrAGon_MidDLe\n\nstores the list of proxy URLs used to interact with C2 server\nSection 2\n\nThe second section of the PowerShell script has the ability to perform encryption and decryption of messages that are\nexchanged between the system and the C2 server. The algorithm used for encryption and decryption is RSA, which\nleverages the public and private key exponents included in Section 1 of the PowerShell script.\n\nSection 3\n\nThe third section of the PowerShell script is the biggest section and has a wide variety of functionalities.\n\nDuring analysis, we observed a code section where a message written in Chinese and hard coded in the script will be\nprinted in the case of an error while connecting to the C2 server:\n\n\n-----\n\niranian-ttps-phishing-code\n\n\nThe English translation for this message is: “Cannot connect to website, please wait for dragon”.\n\nOther functionalities provided by this section of the PowerShell Script are as follows:\n\nRetrieves the following data from the system by leveraging Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) queries\nand environment variables:\n\nIP Address from Network Adapter Configuration\nOS Name\nOS Architecture\nComputer Name\nComputer Domain Name\nUsername\n\nAll of this data is concatenated and formatted as shown in Figure 13.\n\n\n-----\n\nConcatenated and formatted data retrieved by PowerShell script\n\n\nFigure 13: Concatenated and\n\nformatted data retrieved by PowerShell script\n\nRegister the victim’s machine to the C2 server by sending the REGISTER command to the server. In response, if\nthe status is OK, then a TOKEN is received from the C2 server that is used to synchronize the activities between the\nvictim’s machine and the C2 server.\n\nWhile sending to the C2 server, the data is formatted as follows:\n\n@{SYSINFO = $get.ToString(); ACTION = \"REGISTER\";}\n\nAbility to take screenshots.\n\nChecks for the presence of security tools (detailed in the Appendix) and if any of these security tools are discovered,\nthen the system will be shut down, as shown in Figure 14.\n\n\n-----\n\nSystem shut down upon discovery of security tools\n\n\nFigure 14: System shut down\n\nupon discovery of security tools\n\nAbility to receive PowerShell script from the C2 server and execute on the machine. Several techniques are\nemployed for executing the PowerShell code:\n\nIf command starts with “excel”, then it leverages DDEInitiate Method of Excel.Appilcation to execute the code:\n\n\n-----\n\niranian-ttps-phishing-code1\n\n\nIf the command starts with “outlook”, then it leverages Outlook.Application and MSHTA to execute the code:\n\n\n-----\n\niranian-ttps-phishing-code2\n\n\nIf the command starts with “risk”, then execution is performed through DCOM object:\n\n\n-----\n\niranian-ttps-phishing-code3\n\n\nFile upload functionality.\n\nAbility to disable Microsoft Office Protected View (as shown in Figure 15) by setting the following keys in the\nWindows Registry:\n\nDisableAttachmentsInPV\nDisableInternetFilesInPV\nDisableUnsafeLocationsInPV\n\n\n-----\n\nDisabling Microsoft Office Protected View\n\n\nFigure 15: Disabling Microsoft\n\nOffice Protected View\n\nAbility to remotely reboot or shut down or clean the system based on the command received from the C2 server, as\nshown in Figure 16.\n\n\n-----\n\nReboot, shut down and clean commands\n\n\nFigure 16: Reboot, shut down and\n\nclean commands\n\nAbility to sleep for a given number of seconds.\n\nThe following table summarizes the main C2 commands supported by this PowerShell Script.\n\n**C2 Command** **Purpose**\n\nreboot Reboot the system using shutdown command\n\nshutdown Shut down the system using shutdown command\n\nclean Wipe the Drives, C:\\, D:\\, E:\\, F:\\\n\nscreenshot Take a screenshot of the System\n\nupload Encrypt and upload the information from the system\n\nexcel Leverage Excel.Application COM object for code execution\n\noutlook Leverage Outlook.Application COM object for code execution\n\nrisk Leverage DCOM object for code execution\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n\n-----\n\nThis activity shows us that TEMP.Zagros stays up-to-date with the latest code execution and persistence mechanism\ntechniques, and that they can quickly leverage these techniques to update their malware. By combining multiple layers of\nobfuscation, they deter the process of reverse engineering and also attempt to evade security products.\n\nUsers can protect themselves from such attacks by disabling Office macros in their settings and also by being more\nvigilant when enabling macros (especially when prompted) in documents, even if such documents are from seemingly\ntrusted sources.\n\n**Indicators of Compromise**\n\nMacro based Documents and Hashes\n\n**SHA256 Hash** **Filename**
