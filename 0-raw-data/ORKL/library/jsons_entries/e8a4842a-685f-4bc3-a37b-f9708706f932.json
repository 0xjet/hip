This domain\ntakeover allows Microsoft and its partners to sinkhole the malicious traffic and analyze it to\nidentify further victims.\n\n**DNS**\n\n**lookup of C2**\n\n## FireEye and Microsoft create a Sunburst kill switch\n\nToday, [Brian Krebs was the first to reveal that FireEye, Microsoft, and Godaddy collaborated](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/12/malicious-domain-in-solarwinds-hack-turned-into-killswitch/)\nto create a kill switch for the Sunburst malware.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn a statement also sent to BleepingComputer, FireEye explains that they used\nthe avsvmcloud[.]com takeover to create a kill switch that unloads the Sunburst malware on\ninfected machines.\n\n\"SUNBURST is the malware that was distributed through SolarWinds software. As part of\nFireEye's analysis of SUNBURST, we identified a killswitch that would prevent SUNBURST\nfrom continuing to operate.\"\n\n\"Depending on the IP address returned when the malware resolves avsvmcloud[.]com,\nunder certain conditions, the malware would terminate itself and prevent further execution.\nFireEye collaborated with GoDaddy and Microsoft to deactivate SUNBURST infections.\"\n\n\"This killswitch will affect new and previous SUNBURST infections by disabling SUNBURST\ndeployments that are still beaconing to avsvmcloud[.]com,\" FireEye told BleepingComputer\nin a statement.\n\nWhile FireEye does not provide specific details regarding the kill switch, we can see how\nthe kill switch works from their previous analysis.\n\nAs part of this collaboration, GoDaddy has created a wildcard DNS resolution so that any\nsubdomain of avsvmcloud[.]com resolves to 20.140.0.1. This is illustrated by a DNS lookup\nfor a made-up subdomain, as shown below.\n\n**Wildcard DNS resolution for avsvmcloud[.]com**\nDue to this wildcard DNS resolution, when an infected machine tries to connect to its\ncommand and control server under the avsvmcloud[.]com domain, the subdomain will\nalways resolve to the 20.140.0.1 IP address. As this IP address is part of the 20.140.0.0/15\nrange that is on the malware block list, it will cause the malware to terminate and prevent\nitself from executing again.\n\nMicrosoft IP address ranges were likely added to the block list to prevent their security\noperations from detecting the malicious activity.\n\n\n-----\n\nFireEye warned that this kill switch would only terminate the original Sunburst infection.\nOrganizations that were already breached by the threat actors likely have different methods\nto access the victim's network.\n\n\"However, in the intrusions FireEye has seen, this actor moved quickly to establish\nadditional persistent mechanisms to access to victim networks beyond the SUNBURST\nbackdoor. This killswitch will not remove the actor from victim networks where they have\nestablished other backdoors. However, it will make it more difficult to for the actor to\nleverage the previously distributed versions of SUNBURST,\" FireEye warned about the kill\nswitch.\n\nIf is not known if the victims identified via the sinkhole/kill switch are being notified that they\nare compromised.\n\nBleepingComputer has contacted Microsoft with questions related to the kill switch but was\ntold they had nothing to share at this time.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Microsoft: Windows 11 22H2 has reached RTM with build 22621](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-windows-11-22h2-has-reached-rtm-with-build-22621/)\n\n[DuckDuckGo browser allows Microsoft trackers due to search agreement](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/duckduckgo-browser-allows-microsoft-trackers-due-to-search-agreement/)\n\n[Microsoft tests new Windows 11 Desktop search that only works with Edge](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-tests-new-windows-11-desktop-search-that-only-works-with-edge/)\n\n[Get more from Microsoft Office with this training suite deal](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/offer/deals/get-more-from-microsoft-office-with-this-training-suite-deal/)\n\n[Microsoft releases first ISO image for new Windows 11 Dev builds](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-releases-first-iso-image-for-new-windows-11-dev-builds/)\n\n[Command and Control](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/command-and-control/)\n[Kill Switch](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/kill-switch/)\n[Microsoft](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/microsoft/)\n[SolarWinds](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/solarwinds/)\n[Solorigate](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/solorigate/)\n[Sunburst](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/sunburst/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
