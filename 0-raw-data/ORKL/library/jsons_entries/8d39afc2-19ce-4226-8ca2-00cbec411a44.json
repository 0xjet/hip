Root Cause and Scope\n\nCapcom worked with multiple companies including major security vendors and IT specialist companies to carry out an\ninvestigation into the devices and transmission logs affected in the attack. As a result of carrying out this investigation,\nCapcom has found that the incident occurred as described in the following summary. Further, as stated in previous\nannouncements, the Company has been coordinating both domestically and overseas with law enforcement and related\norganizations, while also continually reporting and corresponding on a timely basis with the authorities that oversee the\nprotection of personal information in each country.\n\nAccording to the IT specialists, unauthorized access to the Company’s internal network was acquired in October 2020\nthrough a cyberattack carried out on an older backup VPN (Virtual Private Network) device that had been maintained at\nits North American subsidiary (Capcom U.S.A., Inc.). At that time, the Capcom Group, including the North American\nsubsidiary, had already introduced a different, new model of VPN devices; however, due to the growing burden on the\nCompany’s network stemming from the spread of COVID-19 in the State of California, where this North American\nsubsidiary is located, one of the aforementioned older VPN devices remained solely at this North American subsidiary as\nan emergency backup in case of communication issues, and it became the target of the attack. The device in question has\nalready been removed from the network at this time.\n\nThe IT specialists determined that following this, some devices were compromised at both the Company’s U.S. and\nJapanese offices through the affected old VPN device at the Company’s North American subsidiary, leading to the theft\nof information. While the Company had existing perimeter[*1] security measures in place and, as explained below, was in\nthe processes of adopting defensive measures such as a SOC[*2] service and EDR[*3], the Company had been forced to\nprioritize infrastructure improvements necessitated by the spread of COVID-19. As a result, the use of these measures was\nstill in the process of being verified (not yet implemented) at the time this matter took place.\n\nFollowing the final stage of the attack, some devices at both the Company’s U.S. and Japanese offices were infected\nwith ransomware on November 1, 2020 beginning at approximately 11 PM (JST), resulting in the files on affected devices\nbeing encrypted. Beginning in the early morning hours of November 2, 2020 some of the Capcom Group networks\nexperienced issues that affected access to certain systems, including email and file servers. While the Company halted\ncertain operations, it worked to quickly restore them. The above is a broad explanation of the incident from the external\nspecialist companies, who have provided Capcom with the conclusion that the incident was a malicious, multi-faceted\nattack that would be difficult to defend against.\n\n*1: Security measures that include placing a firewall at the perimeter between external networks and internal networks.\n\n*2: Acronym standing for Security Operation Center. A SOC service is a system that monitors systems and networks around the clock, and supports the detection,\n\nanalysis and handling of attacks.\n\n*3: Acronym standing for Endpoint Detection and Response. A system that introduces software to detect unusual activity on devices such as the PCs and servers\n\nutilized by end-users and supports quick responses to issues.\n\n2\n\n\n-----\n\n3. Security Measures to Prevent Reoccurrences\n\nIn addition to the Company’s existing perimeter security measures, following the incident, Capcom has taken a variety\nof measures to strengthen existing security with the aim of preventing any reoccurrence. This includes the introduction of\nan SOC service, which continuously monitors external connections, and EDR, which allows for early detection of unusual\nactivity on devices. Below are explanations of both the measures Capcom has taken to address the incident and those it\nplans to carry out, as of the time of this announcement.\n\ni. Technical Measures\n\n[Implementation complete] (list of major items only)\na. Leading software company carried out cleaning of all compromised devices\nb. Reverified the safety of all VPN devices and that security measures are complete (further, old VPN device at\n\nNorth American subsidiary described above has been disposed of)\nc. Introduced SOC (Security Operation Center) service in order to monitor external connections around the clock\nd. Introduced the latest EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) to provide early detection of unusual activity and\n\ncomputer virus infection on devices\ne. Reviewed accounts used for business purposes\nf. Further improved management methods for VPN and other devices, including those pertaining to long-term\nstorage of logs to facilitate a quick response in the case that an incident occurs\n\n[Implementation planned]\nWhile Capcom has been informed by external specialist companies and the Information Technology Security\nOversight Committee that items a.~f. above are in line with current best practices, it is possible that new threats\nand methods of attack could be created. Going forward, Capcom will continue to take various measures to address\nany such future developments with direction from the Information Technology Security Oversight Committee.\n\nii. Organizational Measures\n\n[Implementation complete]\na. Launched the Information Technology Security Oversight Committee in the latter half of January 2021 in order\n\nto receive recommendations on a continuous basis from external experts based on the latest trends, with an aim\nto procure external checks and the swift accumulation of knowhow regarding strengthening cyber security\n(including data protection for securing personal information, etc.). Externally, there are four[*4] Committee\nmembers who consist of two university professors who are cyber security experts, one lawyer who is an expert\non both cyber security and the Act on the Protection of Personal Information, and one certified public accountant\nthat is an IT system audit specialist; internally, one director as well as three technicians who oversee security\nand networks participate. The Committee plans to continue to regularly hold meetings to strengthen protection\nstandards.\nb. Established the Information Technology Surveillance Section in December 2020, a new section directly under\n\nthe Information Technology Security Oversight Committee, which gathers information regarding cyber security\nand builds knowledge of preventative measures to make recommendations, etc.\nc. Strengthened the system for regular verification, including for the adoption of tools, in the management of\n\naccounts used for business purposes.\nd. Constructed system to further raise awareness of security and the management of personal information at the\n\nGroup overall.\n\n[Implementation planned]\nBuild out and regulate a system for further strengthening security based on the PDCA cycle\n\n*4: Prof. Tetsutaro Uehara of Ritsumeikan University; Hisamichi Okamura, attorney-at-law, of Cyber Law Japan Eichi\nLaw Offices; Prof. Atsuo Inomata of Osaka University; Mitsuhiko Maruyama, Partner at PwC Consulting LLC.\n\n3\n\n\n-----\n\n4. Compromised and Potentially Compromised Information\n\ni. Information verified to have been compromised\nSince the January 12, 2021 announcement, the cumulative total for information verified to have been\ncompromised since this investigation began decreased by 766 people, down to 15,649 people.\n\nii. Potentially compromised data\nThere have been no changes following the January 12, 2021 announcement.\n\nAs described in previous announcements, none of the at-risk data contains credit card information. All online\ntransactions etc. are handled by a third-party service provider on a separate system (not involved in this attack), and as\nsuch Capcom does not maintain any such information internally.\n\nAdditionally, the areas that were impacted in the incident are unrelated to those systems used when connecting to the\ninternet to play or purchase the company’s games online, which utilized and continue to utilize either an external thirdparty server or an external server (not involved in this attack). As such, these systems were outside the scope of the incident,\nand it remains safe for Capcom customers or others to connect to the internet to play or purchase the company’s games\nonline.\n\nFurther, regarding the total number of people whose data was potentially compromised, because a portion cannot\nspecifically be ascertained due to issues including logs having been lost as a result of the attack, Capcom has included the\nmaximum number of individuals whose data was maintained on all potentially compromised servers. Additionally, the\ncompany has not been able to confirm any damages, etc. resulting from actual misuse of the compromised information at\nthis point in time. (For information regarding ransom demands made to the company, see “6. Regarding Capcom’s\nAwareness of Ransom Demands,” below.)\n\n5. Support for those whose personal information has been confirmed to have been compromised and those whose\n\ninformation has potentially been compromised\n\ni. Capcom is notifying those whose personal information or corporate information has been confirmed to have\nbeen compromised to discuss the background of this incident and current situation.\n\nii. For individuals who wish to inquire about compromised personal information, as has been described in\nprevious announcements, please contact the following support desks in your country or region:\n\nJapan: Capcom Data Security Incident Support Line (Japanese only)\n\nTel. (toll-free): Game customer inquiries 0120-400161\nGeneral inquiries 0120-896680\nHours: 10:00 AM – 8:00 PM\n\nNorth America: Capcom USA Customer Support Page\n\nwww.capcom.com/support\n\nEMEA: Capcom Europe Customer Support\n\nfeedback@capcom.com\n\nThe number of inquiries the company has received in Japan has been declining: In the month prior to this announcement,\nthe daily average was 0.2 inquiries per day; in the week prior to this announcement, the daily average was 0.1 inquires per\nday.\n\n4\n\n\n-----\n\n6. Regarding Capcom’s Awareness of Ransom Demands\n\nWhile it is true that the threat actor behind this attack left a message file on the devices that were infected with\nransomware containing instructions to contact the threat actor to negotiate, there was no mention of a ransom amount in\nthis file. As explained in previous announcements, Capcom consulted with law enforcement and determined to not engage\nthe threat actor in negotiations; the Company in fact took no steps to make contact (see the company’s November 16, 2020\nannouncement), and as such Capcom is not aware of any ransom demand amounts.\n\nWhile there have been no changes to the most recent forecast for the Capcom Group’s consolidated business results (for\nthe fiscal year ended March 31, 2021), the company will swiftly make an announcement in the case that any further\ndisclosure is necessary.\n\nCapcom would once again like to reiterate its deepest apologies for any complications or concerns caused by the incident.\nAs a company that handles digital content, it is treating this incident with the utmost seriousness, and will take the\nappropriate action to address any requests or directions provided by law enforcement and other relevant authorities in each\ncountry. At the same time, Capcom will endeavor to further strengthen its management structure while coordinating with\nthe relevant organizations to pursue its legal options regarding criminal acts.\n\n\n**Inquiries regarding the above information may be directed to:**\n\n**Press Contact**\nNorth & South America: https://press.capcom.com\nEurope, Middle East & Africa: https://www.capcomeuro-press.com\n\n**Customer Support**\nNorth & South America: www.capcom.com/support\nEurope, Middle East & Africa: feedback@capcom.com\n\n**Investors**\nPublic Relations and Investor Relations Section\n(Tel)+81-6-6920-3623 (Fax) +81-6-6920-5108\n\n**Business Partners**\nPlease contact the representative department with which you work\n\n\n5\n\n\n-----",
