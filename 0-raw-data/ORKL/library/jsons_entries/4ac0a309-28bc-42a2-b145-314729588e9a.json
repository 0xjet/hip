However, security researchers can find the service’s link by doing a ROT13 of the string_\n_sggxvg.pbz_\n\n## Step 1: Registering to the Service: Surfing the Underground\n\nWhen we encountered the link, we attempted to register on the platform. However, as shown in Figure 1, we\nneeded a coupon code, creating barriers of entry for curious individuals who were not serious customers, like\nus.\n\nFigure 1 – Registration Webpage for the Obfuscation Service\n\nUsing the [Sixgill and](https://www.cybersixgill.com/) [Flared Systems darknet monitoring platforms, we found coupon codes on several](https://flare.systems/)\n[underground forums. Indeed, the service was advertised on HackForum,](https://hackforums.net/) [xss.is (previously DamageLab),](https://xss.is/search/1827157/?q=fttkit&o=date)\n\n\n-----\n\n[procrd.top and the closed/registration forums alligator-cash and](https://procrd.top/) [exploit.in. Figure 2 displays an advertisement](https://exploit.in/)\nfor the service on the HackForum platform.\n\nFigure 2 – Advertisement for the Obfuscation-as-a-Service on HackForums\n\nAs mentioned in the advertisement, the APK obfuscation service is supposed to offer a “fully automated\nservice for protection of Android applications”. It says it has an API integration and offers a wide range of\nobfuscation techniques to avoid detection and thus enhance the protection of APKs.\nWe used a coupon available in the advertising posts to register for the service. The service was available both\nin English and Russian (although only the Russian version worked properly) and the prices for obfuscation\nvaried depending on the bundle chosen, from USD 20 for one APK to unlimited APKs for USD 850 per month.\n\n## Step 2: Obfuscation and Deobfuscation\n\nTo uncover the obfuscation techniques, we selected the “three-applications bundle for USD 50” and\nobfuscated three applications; they are displayed in Table 1.\nThe Android Locker and SMS-Stealer were chosen for two reasons. First, their source code did not use any\nobfuscation, so it was easy for us to interpret the application’s behavior. Second, they were both flagged as\n[highly malicious on VirusTotal, which meant that it would make sense to use the service from a malware](http://www.virustotal.com/)\noperator’s perspective.\n\nThe third adware application was chosen because its malicious behavior was not obvious. When uploaded on\n[VirusTotal, only one antivirus flagged it as adware. We wanted to assess if we would see different results](http://www.virustotal.com/)\ndepending on the maliciousness of the applications.\n\n**APK** **SHA1 – Original** **SHA1 – Obfuscated**\n\n\n**Android**\n**Locker**\n\n**SMS-**\n**Stealer**\n\n\na48fea41f84dc357ff164b7f2f35e8f09bb8305d 3d81adfef37e817ceb0a45d62d314af1eba27374\n\n98bb4315a5ee3f92a3275f08e45f7e35d9995cd2 d9872e32b5f4cda4aea7beed32ae3f23c753987b\n\n\n**Adware** 4c3a1103960780cc890831280b37ea3a20754fad 494e7942be0ca873ea49e5cf33bed10aa1e7faf7\n\nTable 1 – Original and Obfuscated Applications\n\n\n-----\n\nComparing the results of the three APKs, we noticed that the obfuscation was the same, which confirmed that\nthe service was automated. Thus, for simplicity purposes, we present below the results for the first APK, the\nAndroid locker.\n\n### Step 2.1 Automated Analysis to Compare Android Locker Original and Obfuscated Files\n\n[We started by conducting an automated analysis using MobSF to compare the results between the original](https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF)\nAndroid Locker and the obfuscated one. The results are presented in Table 2.\n\nThe obfuscation process was good enough to hide vulnerabilities found in the original file, thus increasing the\nsecurity score of the obfuscated file to 100/100, compared to 75/100 for the original file.\n\nThe service also changed the Package and Main Activity names to random strings, making the obfuscated file\nlook suspicious at first sight. The number of services and activities also increased in the obfuscated file\ncompared to the original one. The number of activities went from 2 to 10 and the number of services went\nfrom 1 to 3, making the obfuscated file more complex and potentially running more tasks in the background.\nOverall, the automated analysis hinted that the obfuscated file may look more suspicious than the original one.\n\nTable 2 – Automated Analysis Comparing the Android Locker Original File with the Obfuscated one\n\n### Step 2.2 Reverse Engineering the Obfuscated Locker Application\n\nWe were fortunate enough to have a great reverse-engineer in our team: Vit Sembera. Moreover, Vit had\n[already uncovered part of the obfuscation process in March 2020 when he investigated an application related](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/dissecting-geost-exposing-the-anatomy-of-the-android-trojan-targeting-russian-banks/)\nto the [Android banking Trojan Geost.](https://www.virusbulletin.com/blog/2019/10/vb2019-paper-geost-botnet-story-discovery-new-android-banking-trojan-opsec-error/)\n\nAt the time, we all thought that he was reverse engineering a Geost application, while what he was doing was:\nfiguring out the obfuscation service to access the Geost application afterward.\n\nIn terms of the reverse engineering results, the service creates a Dalvik executable dropper and launcher (first\nstage) that opens and decrypts a second stage Dalvik executable (named radio.ogg and located in a\n/tracksfolder in all obfuscated samples), representing the original APK with partially obfuscated symbol names.\n\n\n-----\n\nAll strings in the first stage are encrypted with the RC4 algorithm using a hard-encoded private key that\nchanges on each APK. The obfuscated APK makes a special effort at hiding the RC4 decryption code and the\nsecond stage loader. Fortunately, the RC4 function does not keep its internal state, making it easier to decrypt\nall the strings separately after the key is found.\n\nThe various obfuscation techniques, to prevent a malware analyst from finding the second stage Dalvik\nexecutable, include complex string splitting, the use of decoy strings and methods to lure the analyst on lowhanging fruits, as well as nested junk flow control structures that increased the amount of code to analyze by a\nfactor of nearly 200.\n\n**For further information, Vit summarized the reverse engineering results on the blog titled** **From Geost**\n**to Locker: Monitoring the Evolution of Android Malware Obfuscation.**\n\nFollowing this analysis, we wanted to dig deeper, which led us to expose the service’s popularity, efficiency,\nand potential profitability.\n\n## Step 3: Exposing the Service’s Potential Popularity, Efficiency and Profitability\n\n### Service Popularity\n\nThrough the reverse engineering results, it was easy to fingerprint the service. We leveraged the power of\n[VirusTotal and conducted two Retrohunt jobs that asked:](http://www.virustotal.com/)\n\n_Are there files currently submitted on VT that are: “apks”, “zip” or “jar” with an embedded “radio.ogg” file?_\n\n**Yes! There are!**\n\nThe first job was launched on June 22nd, 2020, and another on October 14th, 2020. The first job yielded\n2,172 files, and we could decompile 1,051 of them. The second job yielded 2,051 files from which we could\ndecompile 2,006 of them. We thus had 3,057 APKs potentially related to the service.\n\n**Are these Obfuscated APKs? Validating the Dataset**\n\nWe decompiled all the applications and extracted information on each of them. We found that all manifest files\nhad Package name, Main activity as well as activity and service names that were long random strings just like\nour own obfuscated files. The radio.ogg file was also stored in a /tracks folder for all of them, just like our three\napplications. We concluded with confidence that these applications were all related to the obfuscation service.\n[For future reference, their SHA1 hashes are available on GitHub.](https://github.com/GoSecure/malware-ioc)\n\n**Yes, these 3,057 applications are related to the obfuscation service!**\n\n[Figure 3 shows the number of applications found on VirusTotal through time. The x-axis represents the latest](http://www.virustotal.com/)\n[date an application was last scanned for analysis on VirusTotal. The flat line represents the pause between the](http://www.virustotal.com/)\ntwo Retrohunt jobs.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3 – Applications Scanned on VirusTotal related to the Obfuscation Service\n\nFigure 3 illustrates that applications related to the obfuscation service are submitted to VirusTotal almost daily,\nwith the peak 216 applications happening on July 24th, 2020.\n\n### Uncovering the Clientele\n\nLeveraging this dataset, we aimed at digging deeper: are these applications from the same group? We noticed\nthat specific files in the /res/values folders of the obfuscated applications leaked information (such as\nstrings.xml and ids.xml files). In these files, the variable names were randomly generated, but specific strings\ndisplayed in the applications were in clear text, as shown in Figure 4. The structure of the ids.xml files also did\nnot change.\n\nFigure 4 – Extract of strings.xml File of an Obfuscated Application\n\nWe leveraged these files, extracting the first strings of characters displayed in the “strings.xml” file and\nevaluating the structure of ids.xml files. We then grouped APKs together if they had the same first string in\nstrings.xml or the same structure in the ids.xml file or both.\nThis yielded seven distinct groups and an eighth group, encompassing all outliers. We investigated further by\n[taking a sample of a dozen APKs from each group and analyzed them in apklab.io.](https://www.apklab.io/) [Apklab.io is a mobile-](https://www.apklab.io/)\nthreat intelligence platform created and maintained by Avast, that displays results of APK dynamic analysis.\n\n[From each group, the dozen of APKs analyzed via apklab.io ended up behaving similarly: connecting to the](https://www.apklab.io/)\nsame domains or to similar domains (like ccc1ccc.ru and bbb1bbb.ru) and once the second stage was\nlaunched, exposing similar patterns of behaviors.\n\nTable 2 briefly presents the results for each group, including the application names (most likely faked), the\nnumber of APKs in each group, and some insights from the dozens of applications investigated. Obviously, we\ncannot confirm that each group found in the sample represents a specific client using the service, but the\npreliminary analysis shows that the service is used by several actors involved in spreading malicious\n\n\n-----\n\napplications related to malware. For example, the fourth group represents APKs that connect to the rakason.ru\n[domain, which was found to be related to the flexnet malware, and one group of APKs is associated with](https://twitter.com/verovaleros/status/1268244469251543042)\n[domains that were linked to another Android Banking Trojan botnet. The seven groups could also represent](https://twitter.com/rebensk/status/1269233752397557760)\nseveral types of APKs belonging to one client.\n\nWhat we can conclude from this analysis is that these APKs do not belong to thousands of clients, but rather a\nfew number of them (most likely less than ten).\n\n\n**Group** **Application Name** **N.**\n**APKs**\n\n\n**Insights on samples investigated**\n\n\n**1** Flash Player, Instagram\nShared\n\n**2** Sistem Güncelleştirmesi\n(System Update)\n\n**3** Android Guncelleme\n(Android Update),\nBrowser Guncellemesi\n(Browser Update)\n\n**4** МОД (много денег) –\nMOD (a lot of money)\n\n**5** FlashPlayer, Romance\nMod, Spotify++\n\n**6** Flash Player, GoogleGPS,\nAndroid Guncellemesi\n(Android Update), Google\nUpdate & more\n\n\n1,697 Samples investigated communicated with DNS address\nstatic.66.170.99.88.clients.your-server.de via HTTP\n\n416 Samples investigated connected via HTTP to one of these\ndomains: orucakacdkkaldi.com (104.217.127.209), ba2a.com\n(108.187.35.84), selammigo34.com (34.91.209.109) and\ngunaydinmorroc.com (104.217.127.131) .\n\n251 Samples investigated connected via HTTPS to one of these\ndomains: hnoraip.world, kalyanshop.best,\ndontworryman.club,\nPlaceoftomcat.club.

We first compared](https://www.virustotal.com/)\nthe original and obfuscated files related to our investigation. The results are shown in Table 5.\n\n**Original** **Obfuscated**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Android Locker APK** 27/65 engines 16/65 engines\n\n**SMS-Stealer APK** 29/65 engines 13/65 engines\n\n**Adware APK** 1/65 engine 10/65 engines\n\nTable 5 – Antivirus Detections Obfuscated and Non-Obfuscated Files\n\nAs shown in Table 5, the Android Locker and the SMS-stealer APKs were detected by 42% and 45% of the\nantiviruses respectively. Using the obfuscation service decreased the detection to 25% and 20% respectively.\nThus, the service is efficient at reducing the detection rate when the file is malicious by nearly half. On the\nother hand, the detection rate for the adware APK increased from one to ten.\nSeeing an increase in detections for the adware APK raised questions. Thus, to investigate further, we\nobfuscated an application that was absolutely not malicious: the function of the application was to print “Hello\nWorld”. The original application had no detection, but once obfuscated, 8 antiviruses out of 65 flagged\n**it as malicious, even tagging it as a ‘dropper’ and a ‘banker’. Such findings confirmed that non-malicious**\napplications could see their detection rate increase when using the obfuscation service, leading us to\nhypothesize that the potential clients of the service are individuals involved in developing highly malicious\n[applications. We then looked at the applications found on VirusTotal and inquired: are these APKs flagged as](http://www.virustotal.com/)\n**malicious as well?**\n\n**Turned out that yes, without a doubt!**\n\nThey were all flagged as malicious, the minimum number of detections was 8, just like the benign application\n[above, and the maximum number of detections was 32. On average, the APKs found on VirusTotal were](http://www.virustotal.com/)\nflagged as malicious by 18 antiviruses (with a standard deviation of 4.79). Figure 6 shows the range of\ndetections depending on groups.\n\nFigure 6 – Detection Variation by Groups\n\nFigure 6 shows that the average detection rate differed depending on APK groups. To ensure that this finding\nwas not just a visual approximation, we computed a series of tests of mean differences and found that there\nexist significant mean differences in detection rates between each group!\n\n**There are significant differences in detection rates for each APK group, hinting again that these**\n**groups could represent different clients.**\n\n### Estimating Revenue Potential of Maintaining an Obfuscation-as-a-Service Platform\n\n\n-----\n\nOne of our final tasks was to assess the service potential revenue considering only the applications found on\n[VirusTotal. The obfuscation service offered different price categories. The most expensive option was to](http://www.virustotal.com/)\nobfuscate one file for USD 20. The cheapest option (if one had many applications to obfuscate) allowed\nunlimited access to the service for USD 850 per month. Figure 7 shows the different price bundles offered in\nRussian.\n\nFigure 7 – Obfuscation-as-a-Service Prices\n\nTo estimate revenues, we followed this strategy: for all groups that have hundreds of scanned APKs scattered\nthroughout the period of study, we consider the number of months each group operated and count an API\nprice bundle of $850 per month. For the remaining groups that have only a few APKs uploaded at different\npoints in time, we considered the highest price: USD 20 per APK.\n**Following this pricing strategy, we estimate that the operators behind the obfuscation-as-a-service**\n**platform would have made USD 22,490 for the APKs found on** **[VirusTotal.](http://www.virustotal.com/)**\n\nAnother strategy was to create an interval taking into account the highest and the lowest prices. Considering\nthat all the applications would have been purchased at the price of USD 20 per APK, then those behind the\nobfuscation-as-a-service platform would have made USD 61,060. Considering, on the other hand, that all\nobfuscated applications would have been purchased with one API access through six months of operation,\nthen those behind the obfuscation-as-a-service platform would have made only USD 5,100. The first\napproximation, USD 22 490, is situated closer to the lower bound of the interval and seems to be a better\napproximation of what the administrators would have made because it considers API accesses for APKs\ngrouped together due to their similarities. It is unlikely that malware authors would pay a full price of USD 20\nper APK for each file in these groups. Whether this amount can be considered substantive depends on where\none is positioned in the world.\n\n### Market Ecosystem\n\nLastly, we wanted to position the obfuscation-as-a-service within its market ecosystem. Using the Sixgill\n[DarkNet monitoring tool as well as the Flare.System one, we searched potential competitors leveraging the](https://flare.systems/)\nkeyword “crypt” (which was the “slang” word used by Geost operators to talk about the service). We found,\nsince January 2020, six potential competitors, advertising “APK crypt service” on different underground\nforums, as shown in Table 6.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe prices advertised by each competitor were higher than the service we investigated. Moreover, none of\nthem offered an automated platform with API access. Instead, they all asked potential clients to contact them\nvia messaging applications like Jabber or Telegram.\n\nThese competitors seem to conduct their obfuscations manually, rather than automatically (explaining their\nhigher prices). This also means that the obfuscation-as-a-service investigated may have had a competitive\nedge by offering an “automated service”.\n\n\n**Service or**\n**User**\n\n**Competitor**\n**1**\n\n**Competitor**\n**2**\n\n**Competitor**\n**3**\n\n**Competitor**\n**4**\n\n**Competitor**\n**5**\n\n**Competitor**\n**6**\n\n\n**Forum** **Date** **Prices**\n\nXSS August 2020 $30 for 1 APK\n$80 for 4 APKs (1 week)\n$135 for 12 APKs (1 week)\n$250 for 25 APKs (1 week)\n$300 for 45 APKs (1 week)\n\n\nSKYNETZONE CHAT telegram\ngroup\n\n\nXSS\nClub2crd\nDark Market\nDevil Team CenterClub\n\n\nJanuary\n2020\n\n\n$20 for 1 APK\n$100 for weekly submission with max 10\nAPKs/day\n\n\nClub2crd August 2020 $100 for 1 APK\n\nHackforums July 2020 $25 for 1 APK\n$70 for 3 APKs\n$99 for 5 APKs\n\n\nUfolabs October\n2020\n\n\nNovember\n2020\n\n\n$30 for 1 APK\n$150 for 4 APKs (1 week)\n$350 for 12 APKs (1 week)\n$550 for 25 APKs (1 week)\n$1000 for 45 APKs (1 week)\n\n$150 for 4 APKs (1 week)\n$350 for 12 APKs (1 week)\n$550 for 25 APKs (1 week)\n$1000 for 45 APKs (1 week)\n\n\nTable 6 – Obfuscation-as-a-Service Competitors\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOverall, we conclude that the obfuscation-as-a-service platform provides a medium quality obfuscation\nservice. Indeed, a lot of work has been put into automating the obfuscation process, yet a few mistakes made\nit easier to fingerprint the obfuscation. We also believe that the platform’s clientele is formed of individuals\ndeveloping highly malicious applications. Indeed, the service is only efficient at reducing detection for such\napplications.\nCurrently, the platform has been down since late August 2020. Yet, obfuscated APKs with the same\n[obfuscation techniques are still being uploaded on VirusTotal as of November 2020. Possibly, the applications](http://www.virustotal.com/)\n[scanned by VirusTotal are applications obfuscated before the platform’s shutdown or the operators are still](http://www.virustotal.com/)\nactive without the web platform.\n\nAs a last note, we hope that this work can be helpful to security analysts and reverse engineers who face\nobscure applications every day.\n\n\n-----\n\n_[The hash of each obfuscated APK found on VirusTotal is available on GitHub.](http://www.virustotal.com/)_\n\n\n-----",
