The installed payload is a bot client (embedded in the\ndropper). It seeks the /tmp directory path, extracted embedded binary data and creates file\n**\"/tmp/fileXXXXXX\" (X= combination permutated strings), i.e: \"fileCo70r0\", then it saves the**\nexecutable code into dropped ELF bot binary.\n\nThe dropped ELF binary is the payload, a DDOS bot client, that is having basic stuff like\nremote execution, receiving bot commands, encrypted traffic functions, etc), see below for\ndetail.\n\nThe interesting part for the dropper is, after dropping the payload, it installs persistence\nstartup to \"/etc/cron.hourly/0\" and lastly executed the dropped binary and then cleaned-up\nitself. The dumped the embedded ELF is with the hash :\n**269029c1554b13c3eccfaacf0196ff72 (you can check this hash after you drop / extract**\nembedded part).\n\n**How to detect by behavior in a glance:**\n\nThe dropped binary is a bot client that will print \"IVEBEENEXECUTED\" on execution, and\nmade below networking:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n1. listening to (bind to 127.0.0.1) TCP/12645 < likely a command receiver port\n2. callback to C2 (bind to LOCALIP:HIGHPORTS) at 209.126.69.167:2020 (IP = AS6428\nRiver City Internet Group, Primary Networks, USA)\n\n```\nPS: The source of this infection is also from USA network: 104.244.72.54 on AS53667 at\nPonyNET, honeypots detected it:\n```\n104[.]244[.]72[.]54/RHOMBUS.sh4\n104[.]244[.]72[.]54/RHOMBUS.x86\n104[.]244[.]72[.]54/RHOMBUS.arm5\n104[.]244[.]72[.]54/RHOMBUS.x86_64\n104[.]244[.]72[.]54/RHOMBUS.mpsl\n\n```\nInteresting strings in the embedded (or) the dropped binary, aka the payload is:\n```\n0xZ6c8 48 47 %s %s HTTP/1.1\\r\\nHost: %s\\r\\nConnection: close\\r\\n\\r\\n\n0x_1bd 5 4 \\b\\n\\n\\n\n0x_1d0 9 8 hlLjztqZ\n0x_220 21 20 npxXoudifFeEgGaACScs\n0x_235 8 7 +0-#'I\n0x_2a8 15 14 Unknown error\n0x_2c0 8 7 Success\n0x_e1d 8 7 /bin/sh\n\n```\nsome_ encrypted strings are intact, you can \"grep\" these:\n```\n0x_6f8 7 6 {inod\\f\n0x_6ff 5 4 snnu\n0x_704 10 9 0110biho\\f\n0x_70e 9 8 edg`tmu\\f\n(etc)\n\n```\n**So, What is this threat anyway?**\n\nWe were suspecting this ELF dropper is a part of [a new ELF/linux DDoSer w/new installer](https://twitter.com/malwaremustd1e/status/1238047495172673536)\n[possibilities were varied, maybe CLOUDSNOOPER or, and, well, in the end it is just a](https://news.sophos.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/CloudSnooper_report.pdf)\ndropper to drop \"another\" DDoSer bots. (one of a kind of: Gafgyt, Kaiten, Mirai and such) just\nanother new coded one.. Made by skids in DDoS ecosystem.\n\n**How the payload works in general:**\n\nThe payload has these functions:\n\n1. C2 command receiver\n2. Execution of DoS attack variations\n3. Sending data to C2 of compromised device\n4. Has a remote command execution that can be used to execute downloaded file or\n\ncrafted pushed command\n[5. Encryption to process config and receive-transmission comm.](https://twitter.com/malwaremustd1e/status/1238406598541766657)\n\n\n-----\n\nIn detail it works as follows:\n\nAfter [static reversing & decrypting payloads distributed via the dropper, and also](https://twitter.com/malwaremustd1e/status/1237939384185307138)\n[decrypting/analyzing more recent samples distributed w/o dropper it shows that the](https://twitter.com/malwaremustd1e/status/1238076597116141568)\nconnection to C2 will trigger the real activity of this bot (decryption of transmission data,\nprocessing receiving commands, and offensive execution for five DOS variation attacks of\ncommands, including one of them are sub packeting forged \"urg\", ack\", rst\", \"fin\", \"psh\"\n**attacks, other is with the \"0\" or \"1\" sub attack types, and there's also L7 flood spoofing**\n**for HTTP/1.1 too).**\n\nThe transmission data is using encryption (XOR'ed basis), that's also used for processing\nembedded & hard coded config in the bot client, and also the pushed one through the\nlistening port.\n\nActivities invoked are not only processing bot command but involving the command\n**execution triggered by \"sh -c\" in the system compromised by this bot.**\n\nC2 will be sent (with write method) by encrypted data through connected socket from the bot\nclient, contains data of bot info and networking (IP) with this string:\n```\n\"jm:%s:%d OR \"jm:_:%d\n\n```\nThe infrastructure used by the adversaries to spread the payload and as C2 is listed so far\nas follows, you should block these:\n```\n209.126.69.167 | I167.datasoft.ws. |6428 | 209.126.64.0/20 | CDM | US \n45.135.134.132 | |51659 | 45.135.134.0/23 | ASBAXET | RU \n167.172.128.4  | |14061 | 167.172.128.0/20 | DIGITALOCEAN-ASN | US \n205.185.122.243 | google-public-dns-a.google.com.(fake) |53667 | 205.185.112.0/20 |\nPONYNET | US \n\n```\nStill, I haven't got enough time to check on this thoroughly, currently busy w/other works too,\nI am sure I am still missing one or two, so please add or comment, I will update the info\nregularly.\n\nLet's call this new threat as \"RHOMBUS\".
