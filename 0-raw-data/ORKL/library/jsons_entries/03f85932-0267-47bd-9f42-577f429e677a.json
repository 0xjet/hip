    "plain_text": "# FakeSpy Targets Japanese and Korean-Speaking Users\n\n**blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/fakespy-android-information-stealing-malware-targets-japanese-**\nand-korean-speaking-users/\n\nJune 19, 2018\n\nSpoofing legitimate mobile applications is a common cybercriminal modus that banks on\ntheir popularity and relies on their users’ trust to steal information or deliver payloads.\nCybercriminals typically use third-party app marketplaces to distribute their malicious apps,\n[but in operations such as the ones that distributed CPUMINER,](https://blog.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/17/j/coin-miner-mobile-malware-returns-hits-google-play.html) [BankBot, and](https://blog.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/17/i/bankbot-found-google-play-targets-ten-new-uae-banking-apps.html) [MilkyDoor,](https://blog.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/17/d/dresscode-android-malware-finds-successor-milkydoor.html)\nthey would try to get their apps published on Google Play or App Store. We’ve also seen\n[others take a more subtle approach that involves SmiShing to direct potential victims to](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/us/security/definition/smishing)\nmalicious pages. Case in point: a campaign we recently observed that uses SMS as an entry\npoint to deliver an information stealer we called FakeSpy (Trend Micro detects this threat\nANDROIDOS_FAKESPY.HRX).\n\nFakeSpy is capable of stealing text messages, as well as account information, contacts, and\ncall records stored in the infected device. FakeSpy can also serve as a vector for a banking\ntrojan (ANDROIDOS_LOADGFISH.HRX). While the malware is currently limited to infecting\nJapanese and Korean-speaking users, we won't be surprised if it expands its reach given the\nway FakeSpy’s authors actively fine-tune the malware’s configurations.\n\nAttack Chain\n\nWould-be victims will first receive a mobile text message masquerading as a legitimate\nmessage from a Japanese logistics and transportation company urging recipients to click the\nlink in the SMS, as shown in Figure 1. The link will redirect them to the malicious webpage,\n\n\n-----\n\nand clicking any button will prompt users to download an Android application package (APK).\nThe webpage also has a guide, written in Japanese, on how to download and install the app.\n\nFigure 1: Sample SMSs containing links to the malware\n\nFurther analysis indicates that this campaign also targets South Korean users, and has been\nactive since October 2017. To Korean users, the information-stealing malware appears as an\napp for several local consumer financial services companies. When targeting Japanese\nusers, it poses as apps for transportation, logistics, courier, and e-commerce companies, a\nmobile telecommunications service, and a clothing retailer.\n\nFigure 2: The malicious webpage with instructions on downloading and installing the\napplication\n\nFigure 3: Screenshots of the malicious apps in Korean (left) and Japanese (center, right)\n\n**_Technical Analysis_**\n\nFakeSpy’s configurations, such as the command-and-control (C&C) server, are encrypted to\nevade detection. Once launched, FakeSpy will start monitoring for text messages that the\naffected device receives. These SMS messages are stolen and uploaded to the C&C server.\nTo send commands via JavaScript, FakeSpy also abuses JavaScript bridge\n[(JavaScriptInterface) to invoke the app’s internal functions by downloading then running](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/JavascriptInterface)\nJavaScript from a remote website. FakeSpy’s commands include adding contacts to the\ndevice, setting it to mute, resetting the device, stealing stored SMS messages and device\ninformation, and updating its own configurations.\n\nFigure 4: FakeSpy’s encrypted configurations\n\nFigure 5: How FakeSpy uploads stolen text messages to the C&C server\n\nFigure 6: FakeSpy using JavaScriptInterface to send commands\n\nFigure 7: Traffic from which attackers send the command to update FakeSpy’s configurations\n\n**FakeSpy as a vector for a banking trojan**\n\nApart from information theft, FakeSpy can also check for banking-related applications\ninstalled in the device. If they match FakeSpy’s apps of interest, they are replaced with\ncounterfeit/repackaged versions that imitate the user interfaces (UI) of their legitimate\ncounterparts It phishes for the users’ accounts by ironically notifying users that they need to\n\n\n-----\n\nkey in their credentials due to upgrades made on the app to address information leaks. It\nalso warns users that their account will be locked. The stolen information is sent to the C&C\nserver once the users click on the login button. Besides online banking apps, it also checks\nfor apps used for digital currencies trading and e-commerce.\n\nFigure 8: Code snapshot showing FakeSpy checking for legitimate banking-related apps\nand replacing them with fake versions\n\nFigure 9: UI of the malicious app that phishes the user’s banking credentials\n\nFigure 10: Code snippets showing how the malicious app steals banking credentials\n\n**Evading Detection**\n\nFakeSpy’s author uses different approaches to hide and update the C&C servers. It abuses\nsocial media by writing the IP address on a Twitter profile whose handles are regularly\nmodified. The IP address starts with ^^ and ends with $$. When FakeSpy launches, it will\naccess the Twitter page and parse its contents to retrieve the C&C IP address. FakeSpy’s\nauthor also abuses forums and open-source dynamic domain tools in a similar manner. To\nfurther evade detection, the C&C server address configured into the apps are updated at\nleast once per day. It’s also worth noting that the cybercriminals behind FakeSpy are active,\nat least based on their activities on forums and the related URLs they register to host their\nmalware.\n\nFigure 11. The Twitter pages that FakeSpy accesses to get the C&C IP address\n\nFigure 12: FakeSpy using a forum (top) and dynamic domain tool (bottom) to hide the C&C\nserver\n\n**Best Practices**\n\n[SMiShing is not a novel attack vector, but with social engineering, it can lure or compel](https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/Smishing-is-the-New-Cyber-Scam-that-Targets-Your-Text-Messages-432634773.html?linkId=39427288)\n[victims into handing out personal or corporate data, or direct them to malware-hosting](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/-infosec-guide-bring-your-own-device-byod)\nwebsites. Users should practice good security hygiene: think before clicking, download only\nfrom official app stores, and regularly update credentials and the device’s OSs and apps.\nCheck for telltale signs of phishing, such as grammar errors or certain characters used to\nspoof a legitimate URL, and more importantly, beware of unsolicited messages that seem to\ngive a sense of unwanted urgency.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe ve coordinated with the affected organizations about this threat.
