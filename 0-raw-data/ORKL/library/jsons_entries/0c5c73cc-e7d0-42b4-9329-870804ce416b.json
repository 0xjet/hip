More recently, we have also seen this technique deliver the banking\nTrojan Mekotio, as well as AsyncRAT/NJRAT and Trickbot, malware that attackers utilize to\ngain control of affected devices and deliver ransomware payloads and other threats.\n\nAs the name suggests, HTML smuggling lets an attacker “smuggle” an encoded malicious\nscript within a specially crafted HTML attachment or web page. When a target user opens\nthe HTML in their web browser, the browser decodes the malicious script, which, in turn,\nassembles the payload on the host device. Thus, instead of having a malicious executable\npass directly through a network, the attacker builds the malware locally behind a firewall.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1. HTML smuggling overview_\n\nThis technique is highly evasive because it could bypass standard perimeter security\ncontrols, such as web proxies and email gateways, that often only check for suspicious\nattachments (for example, EXE, ZIP, or DOCX) or traffic based on signatures and patterns.\nBecause the malicious files are created only after the HTML file is loaded on the endpoint\nthrough the browser, what some protection solutions only see at the onset are benign HTML\nand JavaScript traffic, which can also be obfuscated to further hide their true purpose.\n\nThreats that use HTML smuggling bank on the legitimate uses of HTML and JavaScript in\ndaily business operations in their attempt to stay hidden and relevant, as well as challenge\norganizations’ conventional mitigation procedures. For example, disabling JavaScript could\nmitigate HTML smuggling created using JavaScript Blobs. However, JavaScript is used to\nrender business-related and other legitimate web pages. In addition, there are multiple ways\nto implement HTML smuggling through obfuscation and numerous ways of coding\nJavaScript, making the said technique highly evasive against content inspection. Therefore,\norganizations need a true “defense in depth” strategy and a multi-layered security solution\nthat inspects email delivery, network activity, endpoint behavior, and follow-on attacker\nactivities.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe surge in the use of HTML smuggling in email campaigns is another example of how\nattackers keep refining specific components of their attacks by integrating highly evasive\n[techniques. Microsoft Defender for Office 365 stops such attacks at the onset using dynamic](https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/threat-protection/office-365-defender)\nprotection technologies, including machine learning and sandboxing, to detect and block\nHTML-smuggling links and attachments. Email threat signals from Defender for Office 365\n[also feed into Microsoft 365 Defender, which provides advanced protection on each domain](https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/threat-protection/microsoft-365-defender)\n—email and data, endpoints, identities, and cloud apps—and correlates threat data from\nthese domains to surface evasive, sophisticated threats. This provides organizations with\ncomprehensive and coordinated defense against the end-to-end attack chain.\n\nThis blog entry details how HTML smuggling works, provides recent examples of threats and\ntargeted attack campaigns that use it, and enumerates mitigation steps and protection\nguidance.\n\n## How HTML smuggling works\n\nHTML smuggling uses legitimate features of HTML5 and JavaScript, which are both\nsupported by all modern browsers, to generate malicious files behind the firewall.\nSpecifically, HTML smuggling leverages the HTML5 “download” attribute for anchor tags, as\nwell as the creation and use of a JavaScript Blob to put together the payload downloaded\ninto an affected device.\n\nIn HTML5, when a user clicks a link, the “download” attribute lets an HTML file automatically\ndownload a file referenced in the “href” tag. For example, the code below instructs the\nbrowser to download “malicious.docx” from its location and save it into the device as\n“safe.docx”:\n\nThe anchor tag and a file’s “download” attribute also have their equivalents in JavaScript\ncode, as seen below:\n\nThe use of JavaScript Blobs adds to the “smuggling” aspect of the technique. A JavaScript\nBlob stores the encoded data of a file, which is then decoded when passed to a JavaScript\nAPI that expects a URL. This means that instead of providing a link to an actual file that a\nuser must manually click to download, the said file can be automatically downloaded and\nconstructed locally on the device using JavaScript codes like the ones below:\n\n\n-----\n\nToday’s attacks use HTML smuggling in two ways: the link to an HTML smuggling page is\nincluded within the email message, or the page itself is included as an attachment. The\nfollowing section provides examples of actual threats we have recently seen using either of\nthese methods.\n\n## Real-world examples of threats using HTML smuggling\n\nHTML smuggling has been used in banking malware campaigns, notably attacks attributed\nto DEV-0238 (also known as Mekotio) and DEV-0253 (also known as Ousaban), targeting\n[Brazil, Mexico, Spain, Peru, and Portugal. In one of the Mekotio campaigns we’ve observed,](https://twitter.com/MsftSecIntel/status/1418706920152522753)\nattackers sent emails with a malicious link, as shown in the image below.\n\n_Figure 2. Sample email used in a Mekotio campaign. Clicking the link starts the HTML_\n_smuggling technique._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3. Threat behavior observed in the Mekotio campaign_\n\nIn this campaign, a malicious website, hxxp://poocardy[.]net/diretorio/, is used to implement\nthe HTML smuggling technique and drop the malicious downloader file. The image below\nshows an HTML smuggling page when rendered on the browser.\n\n_Figure 4. HTML smuggling page of the Mekotio campaign. Note how the “href” tag_\n_references a JavaScript Blob with an octet/stream type to download the malicious ZIP file._\n\nIt should be noted that this attack attempt relies on social engineering and user interaction to\nsucceed. When a user clicks the emailed hyperlink, the HTML page drops a ZIP file\nembedded with an obfuscated JavaScript file.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5. ZIP file with an obfuscated JavaScript file_\n\nWhen the user opens the ZIP file and executes the JavaScript, the said script connects to\nhxxps://malparque[.]org/rest/restfuch[.]png and downloads another ZIP file that masquerades\nas a PNG file. This second ZIP file contains the following files related to DAEMON Tools:\n\n_sptdintf.dll – This is a legitimate file. Various virtual disc applications, including_\nDAEMON Tools and Alcohol 120%, use this dynamic-link library (DLL) file.\n_imgengine.dll – This is a malicious file that is either Themida-packed or VMProtected_\nfor obfuscation. It accesses geolocation information of the target and attempts\ncredential theft and keylogging.\nAn executable file with a random name, which is a renamed legitimate file “Disc Soft\nBus Service Pro.” This legitimate file is part of DAEMON Tools Pro and loads both\nDLLs.\n\nFinally, once the user runs the primary executable (the renamed legitimate file), it launches\nand loads the malicious DLL via DLL sideloading. As previously mentioned, this DLL file is\nattributed to Mekotio, a malware family of banking Trojans typically deployed on Windows\nsystems that have targeted Latin American industries since the latter half of 2016.\n\n## HTML smuggling in targeted attacks\n\nBeyond banking malware campaigns, various cyberattacks—including more sophisticated,\ntargeted ones—incorporate HTML smuggling in their arsenal. Such adoption shows how\ntactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) trickle down from cybercrime gangs to malicious\nthreat actors and vice versa. It also reinforces the current state of the underground economy,\nwhere such TTPs get commoditized when deemed effective.\n\nFor example, in May, Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) published a detailed\nanalysis of a new sophisticated email attack from NOBELIUM. MSTIC noted that the spearphishing email used in that campaign contained an HTML file attachment, which, when\n\n\n-----\n\nopened by the targeted user, uses HTML smuggling to download the main payload on the\ndevice.\n\nSince then, other malicious actors appeared to have followed NOBELIUM’s suit and adopted\nthe technique for their own campaigns. Between July and August, open-source intelligence\n(OSINT) community signals showed an uptick in HTML smuggling in campaigns that deliver\nremote access Trojans (RATs) such as [AsyncRAT/NJRAT.](https://www.menlosecurity.com/blog/isomorph-infection-in-depth-analysis-of-a-new-html-smuggling-campaign/)\n\nIn September, we saw an email campaign that leverages HTML smuggling to deliver\nTrickbot. Microsoft attributes this Trickbot campaign to an emerging, financially motivated\ncybercriminal group we’re tracking as DEV-0193.\n\nIn the said campaign, the attacker sends a specially crafted HTML page as an attachment to\nan email message purporting to be a business report.\n\n_Figure 6. HTML smuggling page attached in a Trickbot spear-phishing campaign_\n\nWhen the target recipient opens the HTML attachment in a web browser, it constructs a\nJavaScript file and saves the said file in the device’s default Downloads folder. As an added\ndetection-evasion technique against endpoint security controls, the created JavaScript file is\npassword-protected. Therefore, the user must type the password indicated in the original\nHTML attachment to open it.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7. HTML attachment constructs a password-protected downloader JavaScript in the_\n_browser_\n\nOnce the user executes the JavaScript, it initiates a Base64-encoded PowerShell command,\nwhich then calls back to the attacker’s servers to download Trickbot.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8. HTML smuggling attack chain in the Trickbot spear-phishing campaign_\n\nBased on our investigations, DEV-0193 targets organizations primarily in the health and\neducation industries, and works closely with ransomware operators, such as those behind\nthe infamous Ryuk ransomware. After compromising an organization, this group acts as a\nfundamental pivot point and enabler for follow-on ransomware attacks. They also often sell\nunauthorized access to the said operators. Thus, once this group compromises an\nenvironment, it is highly likely that a ransomware attack will follow.\n\n## Defending against the wide range of threats that use HTML smuggling\n\nHTML smuggling presents challenges to traditional security solutions. Effectively defending\nagainst this stealthy technique requires true defense in depth. It is always better to thwart an\nattack early in the attack chain—at the email gateway and web filtering level. If the threat\nmanages to fall through the cracks of perimeter security and is delivered to a host machine,\nthen endpoint protection controls should be able to prevent execution.\n\n[Microsoft 365 Defender uses multiple layers of dynamic protection technologies, including](https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/threat-protection/microsoft-365-defender)\nmachine learning-based protection, to defend against malware threats and other attacks that\nuse HTML smuggling at various levels. It correlates threat data from email, endpoints,\nidentities, and cloud apps, providing in-depth and coordinated threat defense. All of these are\nbacked by threat experts who continuously monitor the threat landscape for new attacker\ntools and techniques.\n\n[Microsoft Defender for Office 365 inspects attachments and links in emails to detect and alert](https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/threat-protection/office-365-defender)\non HTML smuggling attempts. Over the past six months, Microsoft blocked thousands of\nHTML smuggling links and attachments. The timeline graphs below show a spike in HTML\nsmuggling attempts in June and July.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 9. HTML smuggling links detected and blocked_\n\n_Figure 10.

Thousands of suspicious behavioral\nattributes are detected and analyzed in emails to determine a phishing attempt.
