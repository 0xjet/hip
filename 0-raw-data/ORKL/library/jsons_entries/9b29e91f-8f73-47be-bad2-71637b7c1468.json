    "plain_text": "# Kaspersky Lab Uncovers ‘Operation NetTraveler,’ a Global Cyberespionage Campaign Targeting Government-Affiliated Organizations and Research Institutes\n\n**kaspersky.com/about/press-releases/2013_kaspersky-lab-uncovers--operation-nettraveler--a-global-cyberespionage-**\ncampaign-targeting-government-affiliated-organizations-and-research-institutes\n\nMay 26, 2021\n\n**Malicious NetTraveler Toolkit Infects 350 High-Profile Victims for Data Theft and**\n**Surveillance**\n\n[Today Kaspersky Lab’s team of experts published a new research report about NetTraveler,](http://www.securelist.com/en/blog/8105/NetTraveler_is_Running_Red_Star_APT_Attacks_Compromise_High_Profile_Victims)\nwhich is a family of malicious programs used by APT actors to successfully compromise\nmore than 350 high-profile victims in 40 countries. The NetTraveler group has infected\nvictims across multiple establishments in both the public and private sector including\ngovernment institutions, embassies, the oil and gas industry, research centers, military\ncontractors and activists.\n\nAccording to Kaspersky Lab’s report, this threat actor has been active since as early as\n2004; however, the highest volume of activity occurred from 2010 – 2013. Most recently, the\nNetTraveler group’s main domains of interest for cyberespionage activities include space\nexploration, nanotechnology, energy production, nuclear power, lasers, medicine and\ncommunications.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Infection Methods:\n\nAttackers infected victims by sending clever spear-phishing emails with malicious\nMicrosoft Office attachments that are rigged with two highly exploited vulnerabilities\n(CVE-2012-0158 and CVE-2010-3333). Even though Microsoft already issued patches\nfor these vulnerabilities they’re still widely used for exploitation in targeted attacks and\nhave proven to be effective.\nThe titles of the malicious attachments in the spear-phishing emails depict the\nNetTraveler group’s dogged effort of customizing their attacks in order to infect highprofile target. Notable titles of malicious documents include:\n\nArmy Cyber Security Policy 2013.doc\nReport - Asia Defense Spending Boom.doc\nActivity Details.doc\nHis Holiness the Dalai Lama’s visit to Switzerland day 4\nFreedom of Speech.doc\n\n## Data Theft & Exfiltration:\n\nDuring Kaspersky Lab’s analysis, its team of experts obtained infection logs from\nseveral of NetTraveler’s command and control servers (C&C). C&C servers are used to\ninstall additional malware on infected machines and exfiltrate stolen data. Kaspersky\nLab’s experts calculated the amount of stolen data stored on NetTraveler’s C&C\nservers to be more than 22 gigabytes.\nExfiltrated data from infected machines typically included file system listings, keyloggs,\nand various types of files including PDFs, excel sheets, word documents and files. In\naddition, the NetTraveler toolkit was able to install additional info-stealing malware as a\nbackdoor, and it could be customized to steal other types of sensitive information such\nas configuration details for an application or computer-aided design files.\n\n## Global Infection Statistics:\n\nBased on Kaspersky Lab’s analysis of NetTraveler’s C&C data, there were a total of\n350 victims in 40 countries across including the United States, Canada, United\nKingdom, Russia, Chile, Morocco, Greece, Belgium, Austria, Ukraine, Lithuania,\nBelarus, Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, China, Mongolia, Iran, Turkey, India, Pakistan,\nSouth Korea, Thailand, Qatar, Kazakhstan, and Jordan.\nIn conjunction with the C&C data analysis, Kaspersky Lab’s experts used the\nKaspersky Security Network (KSN) to identify additional infection statistics. The top ten\ncountries with victims detected by KSN were Mongolia followed by Russia, India,\nKazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, China, Tajikistan, South Korea, Spain and Germany.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Additional Findings\n\nDuring Kaspersky Lab’s analysis of NetTraveler, the company’s experts identified six\n[victims that had been infected by both NetTraveler and Red October, which was](https://www.securelist.com/en/analysis/204792262/Red_October_Diplomatic_Cyber_Attacks_Investigation#8)\nanother cyberespionage operation analyzed by Kaspersky Lab in January 2013.\nAlthough no direct links between the NetTraveler attackers and the Red October threat\nactors were observed, the fact that specific victims were infected by both of these\ncampaigns indicates that these high-profile victims are being targeted by multiple threat\nactors because their information is a valuable commodity to the attackers.\n\nTo read Kaspersky Lab’s full research analysis, including indicators of compromise,\nremediation techniques and details of NetTraveler and its malicious components, please visit\n[Securelist.](http://www.securelist.com/en/blog/8105/NetTraveler_is_Running_Red_Star_APT_Attacks_Compromise_High_Profile_Victims)\n\n_Kaspersky Lab’s products detect and neutralize the malicious programs and its variants used_\n_by the NetTraveler Toolkit, including Trojan-Spy.Win32.TravNet and_\n**_Downloader.Win32.NetTraveler. Kaspersky Lab’s products detect the Microsoft Office_**\n_exploits used in the spear-phishing attacks, including Exploit.MSWord.CVE-2010-333,_\n**_Exploit.Win32.CVE-2012-0158._**\n\nKaspersky\nMalicious NetTraveler Toolkit Infects 350 High-Profile Victims for Data Theft and Surveillance\n\n\n-----\n\n-----",
