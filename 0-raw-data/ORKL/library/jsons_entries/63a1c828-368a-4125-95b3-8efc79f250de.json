Meet ScarCruft’s Dolphin\n\n**[welivesecurity.com/2022/11/30/whos-swimming-south-korean-waters-meet-scarcrufts-dolphin/](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2022/11/30/whos-swimming-south-korean-waters-meet-scarcrufts-dolphin/)**\n\nNovember 30, 2022\n\nESET researchers uncover Dolphin, a sophisticated backdoor extending the arsenal of the ScarCruft APT\ngroup\n\n[Filip Jurčacko](https://www.welivesecurity.com/author/fjurcacko/)\n30 Nov 2022 - 11:30AM\n\nESET researchers uncover Dolphin, a sophisticated backdoor extending the arsenal of the ScarCruft APT\ngroup\n\nESET researchers have analyzed a previously unreported backdoor used by the ScarCruft APT group. The\nbackdoor, which we named Dolphin, has a wide range of spying capabilities, including monitoring drives\nand portable devices and exfiltrating files of interest, keylogging and taking screenshots, and stealing\ncredentials from browsers. Its functionality is reserved for selected targets, to which the backdoor is\ndeployed after initial compromise using less advanced malware. In line with other ScarCruft tools, Dolphin\nabuses cloud storage services – specifically Google Drive – for C&C communication.\n\nDuring our investigation, we saw continued development of the backdoor and attempts by the malware\nauthors to evade detection. A notable feature of earlier Dolphin versions we analyzed is the ability to modify\nthe settings of victims’ signed-in Google and Gmail accounts to lower their security, most likely to maintain\naccess to victims’ email inboxes.\n\nIn this blogpost, we provide a technical analysis of the Dolphin backdoor and explain its connection to\npreviously documented ScarCruft activity. We will present our findings about this new addition to\nScarCruft’s toolset at the [AVAR 2022 conference.](https://aavar.org/cybersecurity-conference/index.php/whos-swimming-in-south-korean-waters-meet-scarcrufts-dolphin/)\n\n**Key points in this blogpost:**\n\nESET researchers analyzed Dolphin, a previously unreported backdoor used by the ScarCruft APT\ngroup.\nDolphin is deployed on selected targets only; it searches the drives of compromised systems for\ninteresting files and exfiltrates them to Google Drive.\nThe backdoor was used as the final payload of a multistage attack in early 2021, involving a wateringhole attack on a South Korean online newspaper, an Internet Explorer exploit, and another ScarCruft\nbackdoor, named BLUELIGHT.\n\n\n-----\n\nSince the initial discovery of Dolphin in April 2021, ESET researchers have observed multiple\nversions of the backdoor, in which the threat actors improved the backdoor’s capabilities and made\nattempts to evade detection.\nA notable feature of earlier Dolphin versions we analyzed is the ability to modify the settings of\nvictims’ signed-in Google and Gmail accounts to lower their security.\n\n## ScarCruft profile\n\nScarCruft, also known as APT37 or Reaper, is an espionage group that has been operating since at least\n2012. It primarily focuses on South Korea, but other Asian countries also have been targeted. ScarCruft\nseems to be interested mainly in government and military organizations, and companies in various\nindustries linked to the interests of North Korea.\n\n## Dolphin overview\n\nIn 2021, ScarCruft conducted a watering-hole attack on a South Korean online newspaper focused on\nNorth Korea. The attack consisted of multiple components, including an Internet Explorer exploit and\nshellcode leading to a backdoor named BLUELIGHT, reported by [Volexity and](https://www.volexity.com/blog/2021/08/17/north-korean-apt-inkysquid-infects-victims-using-browser-exploits/) [Kaspersky.](https://securelist.com/apt-trends-report-q2-2021/103517/)\n\nIn those reports, the BLUELIGHT backdoor was described as the attack’s final payload. However, when\nanalyzing the attack, we discovered through ESET telemetry a second, more sophisticated backdoor,\ndeployed on selected victims via BLUELIGHT. We named this backdoor Dolphin based on a PDB path\nfound in the executable.\n\nWhile the BLUELIGHT backdoor performs basic reconnaissance and evaluation of the compromised\nmachine after exploitation, Dolphin is more sophisticated and manually deployed only against selected\nvictims. Both backdoors are capable of exfiltrating files from a path specified in a command, but Dolphin\nalso actively searches drives and automatically exfiltrates files with extensions of interest to ScarCruft.\n\nFigure 1 provides an overview of the attack components leading to the execution of the Dolphin backdoor.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1. Overview of the attack components leading to the execution of the Dolphin backdoor_\n\n\n-----\n\n## Dolphin analysis\n\nAnalysis of Dolphin’s components and their capabilities is provided in the following section.\n\nThe analysis is based on the first version of the backdoor that we found, 1.9 (based on a string found in the\ncode) with additional information about changes in newer versions. A summarized description of the\nversion changes can be found in the Dolphin evolution section.\n\n### Dolphin installer\n\nEnsuing sections describe the installer and loader components responsible for the execution of the Dolphin\nbackdoor in the analyzed attack scenario.\n\nIt is worth noting that this installer and the deployed loader are not exclusive to Dolphin, and were\npreviously seen used with other ScarCruft malware.\n\nThe installer shellcode follows these main objectives:\n\nDownload and deploy a Python interpreter\nGenerate and deploy a loading chain with its payload\nEnsure persistence of the loading chain\n\nThe installer downloads a CAB file from OneDrive, containing a legitimate Python 2.7 interpreter. The CAB\nis unpacked to %APPDATA%, and depending on architecture, the interpreter ends up in one of the\nfollowing directories:\n\n%appdata%\\Python27(32)\\\n%appdata%\\Python27(64)\\\n\nThe installer generates two file paths for loading-chain components, <loader_step_1> and\n<loader_encrypted_step_2>, with the format <base_dir>\\<inf_name>\\<dll_name>.\n\n<base_dir> is randomly selected from\n\n%PROGRAMDATA%\n%PUBLIC%\n%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\n%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Windows\n%LOCALAPPDATA%\n%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Microsoft\n%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Windows\n\n<inf_name> and <dll_name> are randomly selected from existing filenames (without extension) in\n%windir%\\inf\\*.inf and %windir%\\system32\\*.dll.\n\nTo generate Step 1 of Loader, it uses a script template that is filled with randomly generated names\n(variables, function). The template with generated example is shown in Figure 2.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2. Step 1 template and generated example_\n\nThe script is then written to <loader_step_1>.\n\nStep 2 (embedded in the installer) containing the rest of the loading chain, including the payload, is\nencrypted with a one-byte XOR key derived from the current time and written to\n<loader_encrypted_step_2>.\n\nIn order to persist the start of the loading chain, the installer sets a Run registry value:\n\nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\\n<random_run_name>\\”%appdata%\\Python27({32|64})\\pythonw.exe” “<loader_step_1>”\n“<loader_encrypted_step_2>”\n\nThe <random_run_name> is randomly selected from existing filenames matching %WINDIR%\\inf\\*.inf,\ndiscarding the .inf extension.\n\nTo start the loading chain after installation, it creates a one-time scheduled task.\n\n### Dolphin loader\n\nThe Dolphin loader consists of a Python script and shellcode.\n\nStep 1, the Python script, reads a specified file, XOR-decrypts its contents, and executes the resulting\nshellcode.\n\nStep 2, shellcode, creates a host process (random CLI executable from %WINDIR%\\System32\\*.exe),\nXOR-decrypts further shellcode carried within itself, and injects it into the created process.\n\nStep 3, another shellcode, XOR-decrypts an embedded PE file – the Dolphin backdoor – and loads and\nexecutes it using a custom PE loader.\n\n### Dolphin backdoor\n\nDolphin is a backdoor that collects information and executes commands issued by its operators. The\nbackdoor is a regular Windows executable, written in C++. It communicates with Google Drive cloud\nstorage, which is used as its C&C server.\n\nWe named the backdoor Dolphin based on a PDB path found in the executable:\n\nD:\\Development\\BACKDOOR\\Dolphin\\x64\\Release\\Dolphin.pdb\n\n**Persistence**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe backdoor periodically checks and creates its own persistence by making sure that Step 1 of the loader\nis run every time the system is started, via a registry Run value, in the same way as in the installer:\n\nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\\n<random_run_name>\\”%appdata%\\Python27({32|64})\\pythonw.exe” “<loader_step_1>”\n“<loader_encrypted_step_2>”\n\n**Capabilities**\n\nThe following basic information about the computer and the backdoor is collected:\n\nCurrent backdoor configuration\nUsername\nComputer name\nLocal and external IP address\nList of installed security products\nRAM size and usage\nResult of check for debugger and other inspection tools (such as Wireshark)\nOS version\nCurrent time\nMalware version\n\nDolphin downloads commands, issued by its operators, from Google Drive storage and executes them.\nAfter execution, the output of commands is uploaded. Most of Dolphin’s capabilities are controlled through\ncommands.\n\nThe most relevant capabilities are described below.\n\n**_File exfiltration_**\n\nBy default, Dolphin searches all non-fixed drives (USBs), creates directory listings and exfiltrates files by\nextension. This search can be extended to fixed drives (HDDs), via dedicated commands.\n\nThe following file extensions of interest, specific to media, documents, emails, and certificates, are\nspecified in the default configuration:\n\njpg, doc, xls, ppt, hwp, url, csv, pdf, show, cell, eml, odt, rtf, nxl, amr, 3gp, m4a, txt, msg, key, der, cer, docx,\nxlsx, pptx, pfx, mp3\n\nBesides this automatic search, specific files can be exfiltrated.\n\nIn the newer versions, the default search was extended to fixed drives. The command to get specific files\nwas improved, by caching/storing it in the configuration until completion.\n\n**_Portable devices_**\n\nAmong regular drives, Dolphin also searches portable devices such as smartphones, using the Windows\nPortable Device (WPD) API. It creates directory listings and exfiltrates files. This functionality appeared to\nbe under development in the first version we found, for several reasons:\n\nRelying on a hardcoded path with a username that likely doesn’t exist on the victim’s computer\nMissing variable initialization – some variables are assumed to be zero-initialized, or dereferenced as\npointers without initialization\nMissing extension filtering\n\n\n-----\n\nThe code is heavily based on Microsoft s Portable Devices COM API [code sample.](https://github.com/microsoft/windows-classic-samples/tree/main/Samples/PortableDeviceCOM)\n\nApart from automatic search, the operators can specify individual files to be exfiltrated from portable\ndevices.\n\nIn newer versions, this capability was finished and improved by adding extension filtering. For unknown\nreasons, the command to retrieve specific files from portable devices was removed.\n\n**_Keylogging and screenshots_**\n\nDolphin logs keystrokes for windows with titles containing substrings specified in its configuration. The\ndefaults are chrome and internet explore (sic). This is done via the GetAsyncKeyState API, with keystrokes\nbeing logged along with the window name and current time. Screenshots are also taken at a configurable\ninterval; the default is once every 30 seconds.\n\nScreenshots and keylogging are enabled by default, and can be toggled via a command.\n\n**_Shellcode_**\n\nDolphin can receive shellcode for execution. The shellcode is stored in the registry, under one of the\nfollowing keys:\n\nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Themes\\Classic\\<random_number>\nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\OneDrive\\Update\\<random_number>\nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Internet Settings\\HttpsSoftware\\Microsoft\\Internet\nExplorer\\Zone\\<random_number> (two subkeys as one, likely a coding error)\n\nIt can be executed either locally or in a specified separate process that is created and injected.\n\nIn the newer versions, the shellcode is stored in files instead of the registry, and the stored shellcode is\nloaded and executed on Dolphin’s startup, which was not the case in version 1.9 (the original version we\nanalyzed).\n\n**_Shell commands_**\n\nDolphin can execute shell commands; this is done via the popen API and their output is retrieved.\n\n**_Stealing credentials_**\n\nDolphin can retrieve credentials from browsers in the form of saved passwords and cookies. The following\nbrowsers are supported:\n\nChrome\nEdge\nInternet Explorer\n\nIn version 2.2, this capability was removed, presumably to avoid detection. It was later restored in version\n3.0, but in a different form. It is now dynamically received from the C&C in the form of shellcode.\n\n**_Google account_**\n\nAnother one of Dolphin’s commands modifies the settings of the currently logged-in Google account,\nlowering its security relative to default settings. It steals the existing cookie of the logged-in account from\nthe browser and crafts requests that modify the settings.\n\nFirst, it enables access to Gmail via the IMAP protocol by sending an HTTP POST request to:\n\n\n-----\n\nhttps://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?ik=<GM_ID_KEY>&at=\n<GM_ACTION_TOKEN>&view=up&act=prefs\n\nThen it enables “less secure app access” by sending an undocumented RPC request via an HTTP POST\nto:\n\nhttps://myaccount.google.com/_/AccountSettingsUi/data/batchexecute\n\nThese modifications are referred to as “thunder access” in the backdoor, likely being a reference to the\nThunderbird email client. Accessing their victims’ inboxes with a third-party client via IMAP probably helps\nScarCruft operators maintain access to the victims’ emails after stealing credentials, which may not be\nenough on their own, due to Google’s detection of suspicious login attempts.\n\nThis feature was found in versions 1.9 and 2.0 of the backdoor; it is not present in versions 2.2 or 3.0.\n\n**_Data staging_**\n\nDolphin exfiltrates data to Google Drive storage, staging the data in encrypted ZIP archives before upload.\nThe backdoor also maintains a list of files in the form of MD5 hashes, in order to avoid uploading the same\nfile multiple times. This list can be reset via a dedicated command.\n\n**Configuration**\n\nThe backdoor contains an initial default configuration that is persisted on first run and loaded on\nsubsequent runs. It is stored in the file %ProgramData%\\<variable_cfg_name>.inf, where\n<variable_cfg_name> is randomly selected from existing filenames matching %windir%\\inf\\*.inf. The\ncontent is encrypted using AES CBC with random 16-byte keys and IVs, which are stored at the file’s\nbeginning. The configuration uses JSON format, with hash-like keys. An example of a decrypted\nconfiguration is shown in Figure 3.\n\n_Figure 3. Dolphin backdoor configuration_\n\nThe configuration can be modified through commands. It contains, among others, the following:\n\nEncryption keys\nCredentials for Google Drive API access\nWindow titles to keylog\n\n\n-----\n\nList of file extensions to exfiltrate\n\n## Dolphin evolution\n\nSince the initial discovery of Dolphin in April 2021, we have observed multiple versions of the backdoor, in\nwhich the threat actors improved the backdoor’s capabilities and made attempts to evade detection. Figure\n4 summarizes the versions seen; a more detailed description of the version changes is provided below.\n\n_Figure 4. Dolphin evolution timeline_\n\n**November 2021 – version 2.0**\n\nVersion 2.0 introduced the following changes to the version found in April 2021:\n\nDynamic resolution of suspicious APIs instead of static imports (for example GetAsyncKeyState)\nadded\nShellcode capability finished and improved\n\nPersisted shellcode stored in files instead of registry\nPersisted shellcode loaded and executed on Dolphin startup (previously missing)\nPortable device file exfiltration capability finished and improved\n\nExfiltration by extensions added\nRecognition of internal memory and SD cards (from device ID) added\nCommand to get files from portable devices effectively a NOP\nDevice/drive detection and file exfiltration improved\n\nDolphin now unconditionally creates directory listings and exfiltrates files by extension every 30\nminutes for all drives and devices (fixed drives, removable drives, portable devices). Previously,\nit was just for removable drives; fixed drives were disabled by default and the code used for\naccessing portable devices was buggy and broken.\n\n**December 2021 – version 2.2**\n\nChanges introduced in version 2.2 focused mainly on detection evasion. The credential-stealing capability\nand commands related to it – the credential stealing and Google account commands – were removed. Most\nstrings in this version are base64 encoded.\n\n\n-----\n\n**January 2022 version 3.0**\n\nIn version 3.0, the code was reorganized and classes renamed, with capabilities remaining unchanged.\nThe base64-encoded strings were plaintext again in this version. We observed the following additional\nchanges:\n\nCommand to steal credentials restored in a different form; it now executes shellcode from the C&C\nCommand to get files from portable devices completely removed\nCommand to get files from drives is now cached/stored in the configuration until completion. If\ninterrupted (for example by computer shutdown), it is done on the next run. This is also useful in the\ncase of removable drives that may not be connected when the command is issued.\nInternet connection check added (https://www.microsoft.com); no malicious code is executed if offline\n\nThe differences between versions 2.2 and 3.0, especially the discrepancy in string encoding, suggest the\npossibility that the versions were being developed in parallel by different people.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nDolphin is another addition to ScarCruft’s extensive arsenal of backdoors abusing cloud storage services.\nAfter being deployed on selected targets, it searches the drives of compromised systems for interesting\nfiles and exfiltrates them to Google Drive. One unusual capability found in prior versions of the backdoor is\nthe ability to modify the settings of victims’ Google and Gmail accounts to lower their security, presumably\nin order to maintain account access for the threat actors. During our analysis of multiple versions of the\nDolphin backdoor, we saw continued development and attempts to evade detection.\n\n_For any inquiries about our research published on WeLiveSecurity, please contact us_\n_at_ _[threatintel@eset.com.](mailto:threatintel@eset.com)_\n_ESET Research also offers private APT intelligence reports and data feeds.
