Websites for the City of Tulsa,\nthe Tulsa City Council, Tulsa Police, and the Tulsa 311 websites are also down for\nmaintenance.\n\nThe City's phone systems are up and running, and anyone who needs to conduct business\nwith the City can do so over the phone.\n\nIn a Facebook post, the City states that customer information has not been compromised.\nAs most ransomware operations steal data before deploying their ransomware, some\namount of files was stolen.\n\n\"The City of Tulsa is experiencing technical difficulties on many outward facing programs\nthat help serve the citizens of Tulsa due to a ransomware attack. No customer information\nhas been comprised, but residents will not be able to access City websites and there will be\n[delays in network services,\" says a post to the Tulsa Police Department's Facebook page.](https://www.facebook.com/tulsapolice/posts/10158140013203663)\n\nRansomware has become a scourge on US interests, with new attacks disclosed daily and\nvictims paying million-dollar ransoms.\n\nTo help combat the increasing threat of ransomware, a Ransomware Task Force has been\ncreated to analyze the problem and provide recommended solutions to lawmakers.\n\nThese solutions range from mandatory disclosure of ransom payments to an internationally\ncoordinated effort to help organizations prevent and respond to ransomware attacks.\n\nAttacks on critical infrastructure have also become a significant concern in light of last\nweek's [cyberattack on the largest US fuel pipeline by the DarkSide ransomware gang.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/largest-us-pipeline-shuts-down-operations-after-ransomware-attack/)\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n[Costa Rica declares national emergency after Conti ransomware attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/costa-rica-declares-national-emergency-after-conti-ransomware-attacks/)\n\n[New Black Basta ransomware springs into action with a dozen breaches](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-black-basta-ransomware-springs-into-action-with-a-dozen-breaches/)\n\n[American Dental Association hit by new Black Basta ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/american-dental-association-hit-by-new-black-basta-ransomware/)\n\n[Wind turbine firm Nordex hit by Conti ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/wind-turbine-firm-nordex-hit-by-conti-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[Hackers use Conti's leaked ransomware to attack Russian companies](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-use-contis-leaked-ransomware-to-attack-russian-companies/)\n\n[Cyberattack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/cyberattack/)\n[Oklahoma](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/oklahoma/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n[Tulsa](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/tulsa/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
