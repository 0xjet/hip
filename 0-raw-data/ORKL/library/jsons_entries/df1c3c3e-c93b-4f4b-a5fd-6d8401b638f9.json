Victims of interest are then\ninfected with additional malware including Gh0st RAT to steal credentials for cryptocurrency\nwallets and exchanges, enabling the Lazarus Group to conduct lucrative operations stealing\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. We also discovered what appears to be the first publicly\ndocumented instance of a nation-state targeting a point-of-sale related framework for the\ntheft of credit card data in a related set of attacks. Moreover, the timing of the point-of-sale\nrelated attacks near the holiday shopping season makes the potential financial losses\nconsiderable.\n\nWith activity dating at least to 2009, the Lazarus Group has consistently ranked among the\nmost disruptive, successful, and far-reaching nation-state sponsored actors. The March 20,\n2013 attack in South Korea, the [Sony Pictures hack in 2014, the successful theft of $81](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Pictures_hack)\nmillion from the Bangladesh Bank in 2014, and perhaps most famously this year’s [WannaCry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WannaCry_ransomware_attack)\nransomware attack and its global impact have all been attributed to the group. The Lazarus\nGroup is widely accepted as being a North Korean state-sponsored threat actor by numerous\n[organizations in the information](https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/McAfee-Labs-10-Days-of-Rain-July-2011.pdf) [security industry,](https://www.kaspersky.com/about/press-releases/2017_chasing-lazarus-a-hunt-for-the-infamous-hackers-to-prevent-large-bank-robberies) [law enforcement agencies, and](https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/update-on-sony-investigation) [intelligence](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/19/world/asia/nsa-tapped-into-north-korean-networks-before-sony-attack-officials-say.html)\n[agencies around the world.](https://www.scmagazineuk.com/pyongyang-calling-gchq-also-now-pins-wannacry-on-north-korea/article/669070/)\n\nThe group has increasingly focused on financially motivated attacks and appears to be\ncapitalizing on both the increasing interest and skyrocketing prices for cryptocurrencies. The\nLazarus Group’s arsenal of tools, implants, and exploits is extensive and under constant\n\n\n-----\n\n[development. Previously, they have employed DDoS botnets,](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA17-164A) [wiper malware to temporarily](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/12/inside-the-wiper-malware-that-brought-sony-pictures-to-its-knees/)\nincapacitate a company, and a [sophisticated set of](https://securelist.com/files/2017/04/Lazarus_Under_The_Hood_PDF_final.pdf) [malware targeting the SWIFT banking](https://baesystemsai.blogspot.com/2016/04/two-bytes-to-951m.html)\nsystem to steal millions of dollars.\n\n[In this research we detail a new implant dubbed PowerRatankba, a PowerShell-based](https://www.proofpoint.com/sites/default/files/pfpt-us-wp-north-korea-bitten-by-bitcoin-bug.pdf)\nmalware variant that closely resembles the original Ratankba implant. We believe that\nPowerRatankba was likely developed as a replacement in Lazarus Group’s strictly financially\nmotivated team’s arsenal to fill the hole left by Ratankba’s discovery and very public\n[documentation earlier this year.](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/ratankba-watering-holes-against-enterprises/)\n\nWe also provide a brief timeline of events related to the malicious activity and describe the\nvarious delivery methods that Lazarus Group utilized to infect victims with PowerRatankba\n(Fig. 1). We then detail the inner workings of PowerRatankba and how it is utilized to deliver\na more fully capable backdoor to interesting victims (Fig. 1). Following that, we share details\non a new and emerging threat targeting the point-of-sale industry that we have dubbed\nRatankbaPOS (Fig. 1). Finally, we explain our high-confidence attribution to Lazarus Group.\n\n_Figure 1: Flow of PowerRatankba activity from victims to the Lazarus Group operators_\n\nWhile this report has introduced several new additions to Lazarus Group’s ever-growing\narsenal, including a variety of different attack vectors, a new PowerShell implant and Gh0st\nRAT variant, as well as an emerging point-of-sale threat targeting South Korean devices,\nthere are two key takeaways from this research:\n\n\n-----\n\nAnalyzing a financially motivated arm of a state actor highlights an often overlooked or\nunderestimated aspect of state-sponsored attacks; in this case, we were able to\ndifferentiate the actions of the financially motivated team within Lazarus from those of\ntheir espionage and disruption teams that have recently grabbed headlines.\nThis group is now appears to be targeting individuals rather than just organizations:;\nindividuals are softer targets, often lacking resources and knowledge to defend\nthemselves and providing new avenues of monetization for a state-sponsored threat\nactor’s toolkit.\n\nMoreover, both the explosive growth in cryptocurrency values and the emergence of new\npoint-of-sale malware near the peak holiday shopping season provide an interesting example\nof how one state-sponsored actor is following the money, adding direct theft from individuals\nand organizations to the more “traditional” approach of targeting financial institutions for\nespionage that we often observe with other APT actors.\n\n**To read more,** **[download the full report.](https://www.proofpoint.com/sites/default/files/pfpt-us-wp-north-korea-bitten-by-bitcoin-bug.pdf)**\n\nSubscribe to the Proofpoint Blog\n\n\n-----",
