REUTERS/Carlos Barria\n\n\n-----\n\nThose failures provided a rare opportunity for the U.S. government to identify and publicly\nannounce blame for a malicious cyber operation in a matter of days, something that usually\nrequires months of technical analysis and supporting intelligence.\n\n“Either they made a dumb mistake or wanted to get caught,” said a senior U.S. government\nofficial, who asked not to be identified. “We are not concerned about this activity being some\nkind of false flag due to other supporting evidence. This was Iran.”\n\nAttribution to Iranian hackers does not necessarily mean a group is working at the behest of\nthe government there. Iranian officials denied the U.S. allegations.\n\n“These accusations are nothing more than another scenario to undermine voter confidence\nin the security of the U.S. election, and are absurd,” said Alireza Miryousefi, spokesman for\nIran’s mission to the United Nations in New York.\n\nOn Wednesday, U.S. Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe said Russia and Iran\nhave both tried to interfere in the campaign for the Nov. 3 election. U.S. intelligence agencies\nare still analyzing exactly who in Iran commanded the operation and its intent, three of the\nsources said.\n\nWithin hours of the video being circulated this week, which purported to come from a\nAmerican far-right group known as The Proud Boys, intelligence officials and major email\n[platform providers, such as Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google and Microsoft Corp MSFT.O,](https://www.reuters.com/companies/GOOGL.O)\nbegan closely analyzing computer code that appeared in the hackers' video.\n\nWhile the emails, which demanded that voters change their party affiliation to the Republican\nParty and vote for President Donald Trump or “we will come after you,” appeared to come\nfrom an official-looking Proud Boys email address, the address was inauthentic, security\nanalysts said. The Proud Boys denied they were behind the messages.\n\nHow security analysts used intelligence from the video to attribute the email scheme has not\nbeen previously reported.\n\nA Microsoft spokesperson declined to comment on the company’s collaboration with law\nenforcement. A Google statement on Wednesday night said the activity was “linked to Iran.”\nA Google spokesperson said on Thursday the company was in contact with the FBI.\n\n## ATTEMPTS TO BLUR\n\nDespite attempts to blur aspects of the video to hide their identity, the hackers were unable\nto obfuscate all of the incriminating information, the sources said.\n\nThe video showed the hackers’ computer screen as they typed in commands and pretended\nto hack a voter registration system. Investigators noticed snippets of revealing computer\ncode, including file paths, file names and an internet protocol (IP) address.\n\n\n-----\n\nSecurity analysts found that the IP address, hosted through an online service called\nWorldstream, traced back to previous Iranian hacking activity, the sources said.\n\nAnalysts then cross-referenced those clues left in the video with data from other intelligence\nstreams, including communications interceptions, the government official said.\n\n“This public disclosure of attribution to Iran by the government has been done with\nbreakneck speed, compared to the usual process that takes months and often years,” said\nDmitri Alperovitch, a co-founder and former CTO of cybersecurity company CrowdStrike.\n\nTwo cybersecurity experts, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not\nauthorized to talk to the press, independently said they had seen Iranian hackers use\ninfrastructure from Dutch-based Worldstream to launch cyberattacks in recent months.\n\nWorldstream’s chief legal operations officer Wouter van Zwieten said in a statement that the\naccount associated with the IP in question was suspended after Reuters got in touch and\nthat the Dutch National Cyber Security Center was looking into the matter.\n\n“They’ve just informed us that the particular IP address is now officially registered by them\nand ready for investigation under Dutch Law,” van Zwieten said. The National Cyber Security\nCenter confirmed that Worldstream had been in touch and that it had logged the case but\ndeclined further comment.\n\nVan Zwieten said the server used by the hackers was only commissioned on Oct. 6 and had\nnot drawn any complaints until now. The company said it had no access to the content on its\nservers.\n\nIn addition to sending thousands of emails to voters in states including Florida, the hackers\nalso attempted to share links to the video via fake accounts on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nSocial media analytics firm Graphika said two Twitter accounts began posting links to the\nvideo on Tuesday evening and attempted to get the attention of some media and political\norganizations.\n\nOne account described itself as “Trump’s Soldier” and shared a link to the video with the\ncomment “It seems they hacked voting system.”\n\nA Twitter spokeswoman said: “We acted quickly to proactively and permanently suspend a\nsmall number of accounts and limit the sharing of media specific to this coordinated\ncampaign.”\n\nFacebook said: “We disrupted an attempt by a single fake account to seed information\nrelated to what appears to be an influence operation primarily focused on spreading false\nclaims via email.”\n\n\n-----\n\nReporting by Christopher Bing and Jack Stubbs; Additional reporting by Raphael Satter in\nWASHINGTON, Joseph Menn in SAN FRANCISCO and Michelle Nichols in NEW YORK;\nediting by Grant McCool, Cynthia Osterman and Rosalba O’Brien\n\nOur Standards: [The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.](http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html)\n\nfor-phone-onlyfor-tablet-portrait-upfor-tablet-landscape-upfor-desktop-upfor-wide-desktop-up\n\n\n-----",
