    "plain_text": "# Andromeda under the microscope\n\n**blog.avast.com/andromeda-under-the-microscope**\n\n[Threat Intelligence Team 6 Apr 2016](https://blog.avast.com/author/threat-intelligence-team)\n\nAndromeda is one of the longest running and most prevalent malware families to have\nexisted.\n\n## Andromeda is one of the longest running and most prevalent malware families to have existed. Andromeda was first discovered in late 2011 and it probably evolved from ngrBot/DorkBot. Throughout its existence, the groups behind Andromeda have used various methods to spread the malware and infect users.\n\nWe have seen Andromeda spread via spam email campaigns with infected files attached\n[(doc, xls, pdf, zip.), through illegal download sites, warez (infected cracks, keygens, ..), or](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warez)\ninfecting users via other phishing campaigns.\n\n## Infection vector\n\n\n-----\n\nIn recent months, the authors have mainly focused on spreading Andromeda via exploit kits\n(Neutrino, Nuclear, Angler,..) located on compromised websites or advertisement services.\nThese exploit kits are mainly found on a dubious sites (p0rn, warez, video streaming sites,\nshare sites etc.) but occasionally appear on trusted sites as well.\n\nAndromeda binary files are almost always stored on hacked websites, but we have also\ndiscovered files hosted on a few dedicated servers that only host malware. Not only have we\nseen Andromeda appear on hacked websites, but we have also seen its plugins being\ndistributed on SourceForge.net, a repository that hosts 7zip, VLC player, OpenOffice,\nFileZilla and other popular open source projects.\n\n## Andromeda’s core anatomy\n\nThis analysis covers the latest variant of Andromeda samples, which began spreading since\nthe beginning of this year. The authors have not made many changes to Andromeda’s core\nbinary file, but they are constantly changing the PE packer/obfuscator in the top most layer.\nAndromeda uses various PE packers of different quality to avoid AV detections. Some\npackers also contain other anti-vm/emul/debug tricks. We’ve seen a packer very similar to\nZbot (based on its source code), obfuscated Visual Basic and .NET binaries and even a few\ncustom packers reminiscent of Dridex included in the Andromeda variant.\n\nAndromeda’s authors put a lot of effort into diversifying their portfolio of infection droppers\nand to disable, or at least complicate the sample submission and exchange between AV\ncompanies and their regular process used to scan and thoroughly analyze files. To achieve\nthis, they update the custom packers daily and as a bonus, they bloat the binaries with more\nthan 70 MB of garbage. This strategy can either significantly prolong the sample upload (on\n\n\n-----\n\na slow connection) or cause an overflow of scan/submit limits of some antivirus scanning\nengines (or online scanning services respectively). On the other hand, this trick is suspicious\nand it can help to heuristically detect the file.\n\n## Zbot-like packer in detail\n\nAndromeda’s top-layer packer is interesting and deserves a closer look. The packer is very\nsimilar to that of Zbot, based on the source code. The encrypted payload is stored inside the\n“.rsrc” section as the “raw data”.\n\nThe Andromeda payload is twice encrypted with custom encryption and compressed by the\nRtlCompressBuffer API function with LZ compression (0x002 COMPRESSION_FORMAT_LZNT1). The custom encryption uses random seed values and\ngeneric obfuscation with lots of SMC (self-modificated code) and junk instructions.\n\nFirst payload custom encryption:\n\n\n-----\n\nSecond encryption:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe decrypted data is then ready for a decompression via the significant\nRtlDecompressBuffer API function.\n\n## Payload Loader\n\nUnder all of the obfuscated layers, we found a typical Andromeda payload loader binary. The\nentire loader is very minimalistic (~20kB) and includes the final malware payload in\ncompressed (Aplib) and encrypted (RC4) form and hardcoded config structure.\n\n## Loader config structure\n\nThe structure is hardcoded right before the encrypted payload that is 0x28h (40) bytes long\nand it contains seven values:\n\n\n-----\n\nRC4 key for payload decryption (first 16 bytes).\nPayload size (dword).\nPayload CRC32 hash (dword).\nHeap allocation size for decompressed payload data (dword).\nEntry point of decompressed payload (dword).\nPointer to decompressed payload data section (dword).\nSize of decompressed payload data section (dword). This value is unused by loader.\n\nEntire config structure is located at the beginning of “.rdata” section (VA offset:\n0x00402000h).\n\n## Loader API hashes\n\nIt’s interesting that Andromeda’s loader binary has no imports (in PE directories). The\npayload loader uses only the ntdll.dll library and all imported API functions are hardcoded as\ncustom hash values.\n\nThe malware obtains a handle of the ntdll.dll library via a PEB_LDR_DATA (contains the\nbase address of ntdll and kernel32) trick, well known from many shellcodes:\n\nHashing algorithm is trivial and combines XOR and ROL operations over API names (ASCII).\n\nAll API hashes are stored at the beginning of “.text” section (VA offset 0x00401000h) as\nDWORD values.\n\n\n-----\n\n**loader_api_hashes.png**\n\n\nThe authors seem to be very experienced native subsystem and low-level programmers and\nhave deep knowledge of the AV detection methods. This malware uses very uncommon API\nfunctions in low-level form (Nt/Rtl), which is probably used to avoid standard API\nmonitors/tracers, sandboxes and other dynamic analysis tools with predefined API lists or\nwell known API combinations patterns.\n\n### List of all hashes and resolved API functions:\n\n**Hash value** **API function**\n\n0AB48C65 LdrLoadDll\n\n\n-----\n\nDE604C6A RtlDosPathNameToNtPathName_U\n\n925F5D71 RtlFreeAnsiString\n\nEFD32EF6 LdrProcessRelocationBlock\n\nB8E06C7D RtlComputeCrc32\n\n831D0FAA RtlExitUserThread\n\nA62BF608 NtSetInformationProcess\n\n102DE0D9 NtAllocateVirtualMemory\n\n7CD8E53D NtFreeVirtualMemory\n\n6815415A NtOpenFile\n\nE7F9919F NtQueryDirectoryFile\n\n64C4ACE4 NtClose\n\n028C54D3 memcpy\n\n82D84ED3 memset\n\n## Payload encryption & compression\n\nThe final Andromeda payload is compressed with Aplib and encrypted with RC4 stream\ncipher. The encrypted payload is verified with a hardcoded CRC32 hash and proceeds to\ndecryption if this check passes.\n\nRC4 decryption followed by Aplib decompression:\n\n\n-----\n\n## Final payload fixups\n\nOnce the payload is decrypted and unpacked, it’s necessary to relocate it to its new base\naddress, because it is not a position independent code. This is done through another\nuncommon API call - LdrProcessRelocationBlock - which is a function used only internally by\nthe system to relocate loaded PE modules.\n\nThe API function takes a pointer to a relocation record and information about the old and\nnew base address. First relocation record is stored at the beginning of payload data section.\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter processing each relocation record, the LdrProcessRelocationBlock function returns a\npointer to the next record. This makes it possible to traverse to the end of relocations (there’s\na terminating null, which signals that there’s nothing else to process).\n\nThe last step in the loader part is the API function preparation for the final Andromeda\npayload. All API functions are represented by the same custom hash form (XOR+ROL)\ndescribed earlier.\n\nThere is also a little config structure located right after the relocation records. The first value\nof this structure is a custom hash (DWORD) of the DLL file name. The second value is offset\nto the final payload (DWORD), where resolved API functions will be stored. The custom\nhashes (DWORD) of API functions from DLL terminated with 0x0000h are also stored.\n\nThe algorithm for resolving the DLL file name from the hash is similar to resolving API\nhashes, but it also contains lower-case transformation.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe loader uses a very uncommon method to search and load resolved DLL files. All steps\nare made through low-level API and the authors use the same method with PEB_LDR_DATA\nstructure as described above. The loader uses returned UNICODE string from the\nFullDllName value this time.\n\nThis unicode string with the full DLL path is used as an argument for the\nRtlDosPathNameToNtPathName_U API function, which transforms the unicode file path\nstring into following unicode format:\n\n_“\\??\\C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\ntdll.dll\"_\n\nThis string is used to extract the fully qualified path and the “*.dll” file mask and pass them to\nthe NtQueryDirectoryFile API function, which then enumerates libraries in the system\ndirectory. Each library name is hashed and compared with stored custom hashes. If the\nhashes are equal, the DLL file is directly loaded via the LdrLoadDll API function and the\nloader continues to resolve API function names from hard-coded hashes.\n\nFinally, the loader writes all the resolved function pointers to the payload. The payload itself\nuses a more sophisticated API redirection method, which first copies an instruction from the\nparticular API function to the final payload, then executes it and redirects back to the original\nAPI function’s second instruction. This technique is known as stolen bytes. The authors use\nJMP instructions 0xEB and 0xE9 for this trick.\n\n\n-----\n\nExample of the API redirection:\n\nThese mangled calls of API functions made our analysis harder, because the debugger\ncannot correctly identify/resolve the names of the API functions when they are called this\nway.\n\n### List of all used API functions inside final payload:\n\n\n-----\n\nntdll.dll isdigit, memcpy, memset, NtDelayExecution, NtMapViewOfSection,\nNtQueryInformationProcess, NtQuerySection, NtUnmapViewOfSection,\npow, RtlComputeCrc32, RtlImageHeader, RtlRandom, RtlWalkHeap,\n_allmul, _alloca_probe\n\nws2_32.dll closesocket, connect, FreeAddrInfoW, getaddrinfo, getsockname, htonl,\nioctlsocket, recv, sendto, socket, WSACloseEvent, WSACreateEvent,\nWSAEventSelect, WSAStartup\n\nkernel32.dll CloseHandle, CopyFileW, CreateEventW, CreateFileMappingA,\nCreateFileW, CreateProcessW, CreateThread, CreateToolhelp32Snapshot,\nDeleteFileW, ExitProcess, ExitThread, ExpandEnvironmentStringsW,\nFlushInstructionCache, FreeLibrary, GetCurrentProcess,\nGetEnvironmentVariableW, GetFileTime, GetModuleFileNameW,\nGetModuleHandleA, GetModuleHandleW, GetProcAddress,\nGetProcessHeap, GetSystemTimeAsFileTime, GetThreadContext,\nGetTickCount, GetVersionExW, GetVolumeInformationW,\nGetWindowsDirectoryW, GlobalAlloc, GlobalFree, GlobalLock,\nGlobalReAlloc, GlobalSize, GlobalUnlock, HeapDestroy, LoadLibraryA,\nLoadLibraryW, LocalFree, lstrcatW, lstrcmpiW, lstrcpy, lstrcpyW, lstrlen,\nlstrlenW, MapViewOfFile, Module32FirstW, Module32NextW, MoveFileExW,\nMultiByteToWideChar, NTDLL.RtlAllocateHeap, NTDLL.RtlFreeHeap,\nNTDLL.RtlGetLastWin32Error, NTDLL.RtlSizeHeap, OpenEvenW,\nProcess32First, Process32Next, QueueUserAPC, ResumeThread,\nSetEnvironmentVariableW, SetErrorMode, SetEvent, SetFileAttributesW,\nSetFileTime, Sleep, TerminateProcess, UnmapViewOfFile, VirtualAlloc,\nVirtualFree, VirtualProtect, WaitForSingleObject, WriteFile\n\nadvapi32.dll AdjustTokenPrivileges, CheckTockenMembership,\nConvertStringSecurityDescriptorToSecurityDescriptorA,\nConvertStringSidToSidA, GetSidSubAuthority, GetSidSubAuthorityCount,\nGetTokenInformation, LookupPrivilegeValueA, OpenProcessToken,\nRedEnumValueW, RegCloseKey, RegCreateKeyExW, RegDeleteValueW,\nRegFlushKey, RegOpenKeyExW, RegQueryValueExW, RegSetKeySecurity,\nRegSetValueExW\n\nuser32.dll FindWindowA, GetKeyboardLayoutList, mouse_event, SendMessageA,\nwsprintfA, wsprintfW\n\nshell32.dll ShellExecuteExW\n\nole32.dll CoInitialize, CreateStreamOnHGlobal\n\n\n-----\n\nwinhttp.dll WinHttpCloseHandle, WinHttpConnect, WinHttpCrackUrl, WinHttpOpen,\nWinHttpOpenRequest, WinHttpQueryHeaders, WinHttpReadData,\nWinHttpRecieveResponse, WinHttpSendRequest, WinHttpSetOption\n\ndnsapi.dll DnsExtractRecordsFromMessage_W, DnsFree,\nDnsWriteQuestionToBuffer_W\n\nshlwapi.dll PathFindFileNameW, PathQuoteSpacesW, PathRemoveBackslashW,\nPathRemoveFileSpecsW, StrChrW, StrRChrW, StrToIntW\n\nAs you can see, the authors use many uncommon or undocumented API functions.\n\nThere are some special cases matched by RegEx, where the authors use NTDLL.Rtl\nfunctions from the kernel32.dll library and the Andromeda loader had to load the ntdll.dll\nagain and use proper pointers for the Rtl API functions.\n\nAfter resolving all hard-coded DLLs and API functions, the loader continues to final payload\nEntry Point.\n\n## Final Andromeda payload\n\nAlthough the final payload is very small (~24 kb), the code is very complex and sophisticated.\nThe authors, again, use a variety of anti-emul and anti-vm tricks.\n\n\n-----\n\nAt the very beginning, Andromeda disables Windows error notifications via the SetErrorMode\nAPI function with 0x8007h parameter, which means SEM_FAILCRITICALERRORS,\nSEM_NOALIGNMENTFAULTEXCEPT, SEM_NOGPFAULTERRORBOX,\nSEM_NOOPENFILEERRORBOX.\n\n## Anti-VirtualMachine protection\n\nAndromeda uses a simple and well-known anti-vm trick that compares the names of running\nprocesses with a “black list” of prohibited process names stored as CRC32 hashes.\n\n### List of forbidden process names:\n\n99DD4432 vmwareuser.exe\n\n2D859DB4 vmwareservice.exe\n\n64340DCE vboxservice.exe\n\n63C54474 vboxtray.exe\n\n349C9C8B sandboxiedcomlaunch.exe\n\n3446EBCE sandboxierpcss.exe\n\n5BA9B1FE procmon.exe\n\n3CE2BEF3 regmon.exe\n\n3D46F02B filemon.exe\n\n\n-----\n\n77AE10F7 wireshark.exe\n\n0F344E95D netmon.exe\n\n2DBE6D6F prl_tools_service.exe\n\n0A3D10244 prl_tools.exe\n\n1D72ED91 prl_cc.exe\n\n96936BBE sharedintapp.exe\n\n278CDF58 vmtoolsd.exe\n\n3BFFF885 vmsrvc.exe\n\n6D3323D9 vmusrvc.exe\n\n0D2EFC6C4 python.exe\n\n0DE1BACD2 perl.exe\n\n3044F7D4 avpui.exe\n\nThis procedure is implemented through the classic API functions, CreateToolhelp32Snapshot\nand Process32First / Process32Next. If the malware reveals a forbidden running process,\nthe execution flow ends in an infinite loop.\n\n\n-----\n\nAn interesting feature is the possibility of creating a special key in the registry, which allows\nAndromeda to infect the system even with a running blacklisted processes.\n\nThe process blacklisting functionality is ignored when “is_not_vm” key is present inside the\n\"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \\ SOFTWARE \\ Policies\" registry and when the proper UserID\n(DWORD) is set.\n\n## Persistence\n\nThe techniques to persist the infection and to camouflage the Andromeda PE binary among\nregular system binaries are well designed. All communication goes through an injected\nsystem application - msiexec.exe, which is a part of the standard Windows Installer.\n\nAndromeda copies itself to the %ALLUSERPROFILE% folder and renames the binary to \"ms\n_{random [az] {5}}.exe” where the UserID is used as a seed for the RtlRandom API function._\n\n\n-----\n\nLater, the resulting file’s attributes are set to “FILE_ATTRIBUTE_HIDDEN” and\n“FILE_ATTRIBUTE_SYSTEM” (+h +s) and the file time is set to the file time obtained from\nthe original msiexec.exe file. The well known functions - GetFileTime and SetFileTime are\nused.\n\nAnother trick used by the authors is deleting the NTFS stream bound to the file. They call the\nDeleteFile API to remove the :Zone.Identifier flag from the newly created ms*.exe file (to\nbypass the “File Downloaded from the Internet” warning).\n\n**zoneidentifier.png**\n\nIn the next step, Andromeda prevents the displaying of hidden files via the registry key\n\"Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\Advanced\" and sets proper “Hidden”\nand “ShowSuperHidden” values.\n\nFinally, Andromeda creates a new value (UserID) inside the\n“Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\Explorer\\Run” registry key and sets\nthe path to the previously created “ms*.exe” file. After that, it protects the value by changing\nthe permissions through Security Descriptors. Andromeda tries to avoid modifications or\ndeleting of this value, however, modern AV engines are able to bypass this restriction.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Injection of msiexec.exe and system API function hooks\n\nThe entire final payload is injected to a newly created msiexec.exe process and activated via\nthe ResumeThread API function. The original payload process is terminated after a new\nthread activation and the malware only continues from the injected msiexec.exe process.\n\n\n-----\n\nAndromeda also injects ntdll.dll and ws2_32.dll system libraries. Inside ntdll.dll Andromeda\nhooks the NtMapViewOfSection API function and replaces it with a jump to payload, and\nalso hooks the GetAddrInfoW API function inside the ws2_32.dll library.\n\nBoth API hooks are resolved inside the payload and then jump to the affected API functions\nafter being replaced by jmp instructions.\n\nPart of the resolved code for the GetAddrInfoW API function by payload:\n\n\n-----\n\n## Language exclusions\n\nAnother interesting feature is the detection of keyboard layout settings. If Andromeda detects\nthe Russian, Ukrainian, Belarusian or Kazakh keyboard, it sets a special flag that disables\nthe infection, persistence, NTP traffic and injection of ntdll and ws2_32 libraries.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware is also completely removed from the infected machine if it detects one of these\nkeyboard layouts.\n\n## NTP traffic\n\nAndromeda uses hardcoded NTP (Network Time Protocol) domains to obtain the current\ntime, which is received by the “Transmit Timestamp”, if this connection isn’t successful the\ncurrent time is obtained from infected computer.\n\nThe hardcoded NTP domains are africa.pool.ntp.org, asia.pool.ntp.org, europe.pool.ntp.org,\n_oceania.pool.ntp.org and pool.ntp.org as the last attempt if the other domains fail. NTP traffic_\nuses port 123.\n\nThe malware verifies if the size of the received data is 0x30h (48) bytes and first parses\nDWORD from the “Transmit Timestamp” value.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis value is increased by 0x7C558180h and the result is used as an argument of the\n“aStart” function exported by a plugin.\n\n\n-----\n\nIf all connections to the NTP domains fail, an argument for the aStart function is computed by\nthe payload via the following algorithm based on the result of the GetSystemTimeAsFileTime\nAPI function, instead of the Transmit Timestamp value from the NTP request.\n\nThe “compute_aStart_arg” function algorithm:\n\n## Obtain local IP via sockaddr struct\n\n[Andromeda uses a very uncommon method to obtain local IP addresses of infected](https://www.avast.com/c-how-to-find-ip-address)\nmachines.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware tries to connect various legal servers on port 80 with a crafted socket and\nobtain the infected machine’s IP address from the sockaddr structure via the getsockname\nAPI function.\n\nThe resolved value is used as “la” parameter for C&C requests.\n\nList of domains that Andromeda tries to connect to in the following\norder: update.microsoft.com, microsoft.com, bing.com, google.com, yahoo.com\n\n## C&C communication\n\nAll communication is RC4 encrypted and uses HTTP/1.1 in the raw data format “ContentType: application/octet-stream” with predefined “Mozilla/4.0” User-Agent.\n\nAndromeda contains a hard-coded RC4 key, which is used for C&C server communication,\nfor the downloaded plugin decryption and also for decrypting hard-coded C&C URLs where\nthe key is used backwards.\n\nAll values are hardcoded to a structure located in the beginning of payload data. The first\nvalue is BID (Botnet/BuildID), which is also used as a parameter for C&C requests. RC4 key\nis hard-coded between random junk data and is followed by encrypted C&C URLs. The first\nbyte of each encrypted URL is the length of data and it is used as a pointer to the next\nencrypted URL. Zero byte indicates the end of an encrypted URL data block.\n\n\n-----\n\n## C&C JSON requests\n\nAndromeda uses JSON format for all communication with C&C servers encrypted with RC4.\n\nThe malware includes two types of JSON requests and one command object.\n\n## Infection report / Ask for action request\n\n{\"id\":%lu,\"bid\":%lu,\"os\":%lu,\"la\":%lu,\"rg\":%lu}\n\n\n**JSON**\n**item**\n\n\n**Name** **Info**\n\n\nid User ID Computed from VolumeSerialNumber of infected machine\nHDD.\n\nbid Botnet/Build ID Hard-coded inside Andromeda payload.\n\n\n-----\n\nos OS version Version of current operating system.\n\nla Local IP address Obtained from sockaddr structure.\n\n\nrg Administrator\nrights\n\nLive example:\n\n\nSet 1 if malware process runs under an administrator\naccount.\n\n\n{\"id\":1839815145,\"bid\":8384538,\"os\":65889,\"la\":168732589,\"rg\":0}\n\n## Received command object from C&C server\n\n[sleep_before_request, {unused_object}, [TaskID, RequestType, URL,..]..]\n\n**Object item** **Info**\n\nsleep_before_request Sleep time in minutes before send next request to the C&C server,\nthe most common value is 60.\n\n{unused_object} When this object is found, it is skipped.

It’s one of the most prevalent malware families\nand nothing indicates that it will disappear anytime soon. The authors are skilled\nprogrammers and operators, recently updating plugins, maintaining entire systems and\nlooking for new infected domains with Exploit Kits. Analyzing Andromeda's very complex\necosystem is a challenging task, but we're investigating it further. Stay tuned for the next blog\npost!\n\n\n-----",
