The activity was identified through_\n_a combination of large-scale automated network traffic analytics and analysis_\n_derived from open source reporting. Data sources include the Recorded Future_\n_Platform, SecurityTrails, DomainTools, PolySwarm, Farsight, Shodan, Censys, Team_\n_Cymru’s Pure Signal™ and other common open-source tools and techniques. The_\n_report will be of most interest to individuals engaged in strategic and operational_\n_intelligence relating to the activities of the Russian government in cyberspace and_\n_network defenders. Some technical details from our original research have not_\n_been included in this report version in order to protect tracking techniques and_\n_ongoing research into NOBELIUM activity._\n\n#### Executive Summary\n\nRecorded Future’s Insikt Group continues to monitor\nRussian state-sponsored cyber espionage operations targeting\ngovernment and private sector organizations across multiple\ngeographic regions. From mid-2021 onwards, Recorded Future’s\nmidpoint collection revealed a steady rise in the use of NOBELIUM\ninfrastructure tracked by Insikt Group as SOLARDEFLECTION,\nwhich encompasses command and control (C2) infrastructure.\nIn this report, we highlight trends observed by Insikt Group while\nmonitoring SOLARDEFLECTION infrastructure and the recurring\nuse of typosquat domains by its operators.\n\nA key factor we have observed from NOBELIUM operators\ninvolved in threat activity is a reliance on domains that emulate\nother brands (some legitimate and some that are likely fictitious\nbusinesses). Domain registrations and typosquats can enable\nspearphishing campaigns or redirects that pose a threat to victim\nnetworks and brands.\n\nUsing a combination of proactive adversary infrastructure\ndetections, domain analysis techniques, and Recorded Future\nNetwork Traffic Analysis, we have determined that NOBELIUM’s\nuse of SOLARDEFLECTION infrastructure overlaps with other\ncommon infrastructure tactics, techniques, and procedures\n(TTPs) previously attributed to the group by multiple\norganizations including Microsoft, Fortinet, Sekoia, and Volexity.\nPrevious open source reporting also highlighted NOBELIUM’s use\nof cracked versions of the Cobalt Strike penetration testing tool.\n\n\n#### Key Judgments\n\n  - Insikt Group is confident that the identified\n\nSOLARDEFLECTION infrastructure can be attributed to\nthe threat activity group publicly reported as NOBELIUM;\nthis confidence is based on the use of overlapping\nnetwork infrastructure previously attributed to NOBELIUM\nin public reporting, as well as unique variations of Cobalt\nStrike traditionally used by the group.\n\n  - Broader themes in SOLARDEFLECTION C2 typosquats\n\nhave included the misuse of brands across multiple\nindustry verticals, particularly in the news and media\nindustries.\n\n  - Cobalt Strike servers related to SOLARDEFLECTION\n\nmonitoring that were also previously linked to NOBELIUM\nactivity used modified server configurations, likely in an\nattempt to remain undetected from researchers actively\nscanning for standard Cobalt Strike server features.\n\n  - NOBELIUM has made extensive use of typosquat\n\ndomains in SSL certificates and will likely continue to use\ndeceptive techniques, including typosquat redirection,\nwhen using Cobalt Strike tooling.\n\n#### Background\n\nAnalysis of recent and historical domains attributed to\nNOBELIUM broadly demonstrates the group’s familiarity with, and\ntendency to emulate, a variety of media, news and technology\nproviders. The group has abused dynamic DNS resolution to\nconstruct and resolve to randomly generated subdomains for\nits C2s or root domains to mislead victims. The key aspect\nto these attacks is the use of either email addresses or URLs\nthat look similar to the domain of a legitimate organization.\nPotentially harmful domain registrations and typosquats can\nenable spearphishing campaigns or redirects that pose an\nelevated risk to a company’s brand or employees. A successful\nspearphish is dependent on factors such as the quality of the\nmessage, the credibility of the sender address, and, in the case\nof a redirecting URL, the credibility of the domain name. Insikt\n[Group has previously observed other Russian nexus groups using](https://www.recordedfuture.com/us-election-russia-threats/)\ntyposquatting in support of operations, such as those aimed\nat the 2020 presidential elections, to increase confidence in\nthe validity of the fraudulent login portal used to harvest victim\ncredentials. This tactic has also been [reported recently in](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2021/02/gamaredonactivities.html)\nopen sources in connection with intrusions targeting entities in\nUkraine, likely in support of Russia’s invasion of the country.\n\n\n_This report profiles the unique infrastructure used by Russian state-_\n_sponsored threat activity group NOBELIUM. The activity was identified through_\n_a combination of large-scale automated network traffic analytics and analysis_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1: SOLARDEFLECTION Domain Registration reference in the Recorded Future Platform (Source: Recorded Future)_\n\n\nInsikt Group assesses that NOBELIUM is a threat activity\ngroup operating in line with the objectives of Russia’s Foreign\nIntelligence Service (SVR). The SVR is tasked with providing the\npresident of the Russian Federation, the Federal Assembly, and\nthe government with the intelligence they need to make decisions\nin the areas of politics, the economy, military strategy, scientifictechnical strategy, and the environment. Russia’s SVR defines\nitself as separate by allowing the Russian Main Intelligence\nDirectorate (GRU) to [focus on military intelligence operations,](https://web.archive.org/web/20010331062154/http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2001/3/22/141340.shtml)\n[while the SVR focuses on political intelligence; this is, however,](https://meduza.io/en/feature/2018/11/06/what-is-the-gru-who-gets-recruited-to-be-a-spy-why-are-they-exposed-so-often)\na very high-level view of these operations. The SVR conducts\nits affairs by collecting information via public and private means,\nwith the intended goal of gathering strategic information from\norganizations and individuals who in turn influence strategic\npolicy and decision-makers in targeted countries.\n\nIn 2021, Volexity published [research outlining a suspected](https://www.volexity.com/blog/2021/05/27/suspected-apt29-operation-launches-election-fraud-themed-phishing-campaigns/)\nAPT29 phishing operation that targeted non-governmental\norganizations (NGOs), research institutions, governments,\nand international bodies using election fraud-themed lures\npurporting to be sent from the United States Agency for\nInternational Development (USAID), a government agency.\nThe same day, Microsoft also published [research on wider](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/05/27/new-sophisticated-email-based-attack-from-nobelium/)\nTTPs used in the same campaign and attributed the activity to\nNOBELIUM, the group behind the SolarWinds [intrusions. This](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-with-sunburst-backdoor.html)\n[campaign targeted sensitive diplomatic and government entities](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/05/28/breaking-down-nobeliums-latest-early-stage-toolset/)\nas early as February 2021. They believe the threat actor used\nthis information to launch other highly targeted attacks as part\nof their broader campaign. Additional research confirmed that\na cluster of infrastructure monitored by Insikt Group under the\ndesignation SOLARDEFLECTION since 2021 overlaps with this\nprevious reporting. Ongoing detections within the Recorded\nFuture Command and Control security feed assisted in confirming\nthe registration of new typosquat domains tied to NOBELIUM\noperations. More notably, we have confirmed that several newly\nidentified typosquats continue to adopt the naming conventions\nor themes that were originally flagged as likely being associated\n[with NOBELIUM reporting as early as 2020.](https://www.sekoia.io/en/nobeliums-envyscout-infection-chain-goes-in-the-registry-targeting-embassies/)\n\n\nThe Recorded Future Platform automatically detects\ntyposquatted domains; each newly created domain entity is\nevaluated for typosquatting-style similarity to other domains\nobserved by Recorded Future. An example of this is the\nSOLARDEFLECTION typosquat displayed in Figure 1, which\nbased on the domain’s spelling was very likely an attempt by\nNOBELIUM operators to emulate the T-Mobile brand. A review\nof the frequency in which SOLARDEFLECTION domains were\nregistered over the past two years confirmed NOBELIUM’s\ntendency to register domains in cycles, occasionally taking short\nhiatuses which at times likely coincided with new open source\nreporting attributing several domains to NOBELIUM activity (as\ndepicted within the Recorded Future timeline below).\n\nInsikt Group proactively detects SOLARDEFLECTION\ninfrastructure through an in-depth understanding of the\ninfrastructure TTPs that the group employs (detailed further\nbelow within the Infrastructure TTPs section). Additionally, the\nCommand and Control data set enables us to enrich and identify\nany SOLARDEFLECTION IPs that we have categorized as “positive\nC2”. We then analyze network communications to investigate\nhow the C2 is interacting with infected machines or how it is\nbeing administered by the adversary. SOLARDEFLECTION C2s\ncan be reviewed from within the Recorded Future Platform’s\nCommand and Control data set.\n\n#### Threat Analysis\n\n##### SOLARDEFLECTION Overview\n\nNOBELIUM employs a wide range of bespoke tooling\ndeveloped in a variety of programming languages, demonstrating\na substantial research and development effort in support of\nits cyber operations. The threat group also makes good use\nof publicly available commodity tools such as Cobalt Strike to\nhinder attribution efforts. NOBELIUM exhibits highly developed\noperational security practices in its tradecraft, aimed at\ndisrupting researchers’ efforts in associating their malware and\ninfrastructure to the group. Using a combination of proactive\nC2 detections, domain analysis, and network traffic analysis,\nwe have determined that SOLARDEFLECTION servers share\ncommon infrastructure TTPs, enabling us to confidently cluster\nand attribute these servers to NOBELIUM.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2: SOLARDEFLECTION Typosquat Registration Timeline (Source: Recorded Future Data)_\n\nUsing current DNS records and passive DNS sources,\nwe resolved IPs for newly registered domains tracked as\nSOLARDEFLECTION since January 2022 and reviewed SSL\ncertificate information associated with these IPs. As a result,\nwe discovered several domains via SOLARDEFLECTION tracking\n(see Appendix A) and a continued trend of using both Namesilo\nand Namecheap for domain registration. The reason behind the\npreference for these registrars is unknown; all domains collected\nunder SOLARDEFLECTION had domain privacy options enabled.\n\nAnalysis of the domains covered under SOLARDEFLECTION\nhighlighted a trend around the use of themed domains, primarily\nemulating entities within the media and news industry, as well\nas a smaller nexus around business development-themed\n[domains. Both of these themes have been documented in open](https://www.sekoia.io/en/nobeliums-envyscout-infection-chain-goes-in-the-registry-targeting-embassies/)\nsource reporting in connection with known NOBELIUM activity.\nThe reason behind these theme choices is not fully understood\nbeyond the suspected attempt to masquerade as other brands\nto appear legitimate to targets.\n\n\n##### LUNARREFLECTION\n\nWhile developing our original detection logic for\nSOLARDEFLECTION, we observed a secondary cluster of\ninfrastructure that deviated technically from the main cluster.\nHowever, it contained domains bearing similarities to those used\nwithin SOLARDEFLECTION, and we believe this cluster is also likely\nmanaged by NOBELIUM operators. The similarities include the\nuse of registrars Namecheap and Namesilo and domain themes\nthat overlap with those identified within SOLARDEFLECTION\ndomain registrations. Recorded Future tracks this secondary\ncluster under the name LUNARREFLECTION. An aggregation of\ndiscovered LUNARREFLECTION C2s is provided in Appendix A.\n\nAs seen in the industry breakdown in Figure 4 below, there is\na similar trend among LUNARREFLECTION domains that emulate\nentities within the news and media industries. However, given\nthe volume of SOLARDEFLECTION and LUNARREFLECTION\ntyposquats in these industries, it is important to emphasize\nthat the industry being emulated does not necessarily equate\nto that industry being targeted. Domains themed around news\nand media industry contacts are very likely to be used to target\nentities across a wider spectrum of industries, including those\nthat have been consistently of interest to NOBELIUM operators,\n[such as government embassies.](https://www.sekoia.io/en/nobeliums-envyscout-infection-chain-goes-in-the-registry-targeting-embassies/)\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3: Breakdown of industries being emulated within SOLARDEFLECTION typosquats (Source: Recorded Future)_\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Infrastructure TTPs\n\nRecorded Future continues to monitor NOBELIUM by distilling\nvast swaths of open source and technical data and combining it\nwith analysts’ intimate knowledge of attacker tradecraft. Network\nTraffic Analysis analytics enable users to investigate and track\nsuspected targeted intrusion activity derived from validated\ntechnical data sources. We apply a series of filters and algorithms\nto spot suspicious network traffic concerning these detected\nmalicious servers, highlighting possible targeted intrusion\nactivity. Intelligence Card extensions within the Recorded Future\nPlatform then allow users to enrich this information further using\ndata from close partners such as SecurityTrails, thereby enabling\n[Recorded Future Threat Intelligence module users to efficiently](https://www.recordedfuture.com/license-options/)\nmap out prospective adversary campaigns.\n\nOver the course of our research, Insikt Group observed\nmultiple uncommon characteristics unique to NOBELIUM that\nserve as distinguishable hallmarks in terms of our potential to\ntrack this activity long term. The elements described below are\nsome of the trackable characteristics which have been found\nto be used when investigating NOBELIUM-linked infrastructure\nwith the resulting derived infrastructure covered under\nSOLARDEFLECTION and LUNARREFLECTION.\n\nW h e n a n a l y z i n g S O L A R D E F L E C T I O N - a n d\nLUNARREFLECTION-related HTTP banner data, significant\nmistakes were observed and were found to be consistent\nacross all related discovered infrastructure. A related trend\ninvolves the consistent use of specifically customized SSL\ncertificates. Although these customizations are not unique to\nonly SOLARDEFLECTION and LUNARREFLECTION instances\non their own, the particular curation style of these certificates\nis uncommon and is a practice found consistently across all\ndiscovered infrastructure.\n\nAlso found consistently in SOLARDEFLECTION and\nLUNARREFLECTION infrastructure is a mismatch between\nthe SSL certificate Subject CN (Common Name) and the 302\nredirection location. Further investigation of the redirect location\ndomain shows that the referenced URI is a legitimate resource\nfor a fully functioning website; however, the Subject CN-related\ndomain is typically found to have no significant website data\nassociated with it.\n\n\n##### Activity Spotlight: Role of Cobalt Strike\n\nSome of the key characteristics used for SOLARDEFLECTION\nand LUNARREFLECTION have been the prevalent use of specific\nCobalt Strike instances, including custom payload configurations,\nunique SSL certificates, and the likely use of [cs2modrewrite](https://github.com/threatexpress/cs2modrewrite)\n[to obfuscate C2 traffic. Cobalt Strike servers previously linked](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2020/12/solarwinds-supplychain-coverage.html)\nto NOBELIUM activity used modified server configurations\nto remain undetected by security researchers monitoring for\n[standard Cobalt Strike server features. NOBELIUM has made](https://www.recordedfuture.com/cobalt-strike-servers/)\nextensive use of typosquat domains in SSL certificates and has\nused deceptive techniques including redirection when using\nCobalt Strike tooling.\n\nAnalyzing infrastructure clustered under SOLARDEFLECTION\nand LUNARREFLECTION revealed hallmarks that pointed to the\n[likely use of cs2modrewrite, a modification technique for Cobalt](https://github.com/threatexpress/cs2modrewrite)\nStrike-based infrastructure [developed by members of](https://github.com/threatexpress) [Threat](http://threatexpress.com)\n[Express, an information security blog “created by red teamers,](http://threatexpress.com)\npenetration testers and security professionals”.\n\n[Details of the functionality of cs2modrewrite from its GitHub](https://github.com/threatexpress/cs2modrewrite/blob/master/readme.md)\nrepository state, “This project converts a Cobalt Strike profile to\na functional mod_rewrite .htaccess or Nginx config file to support\nHTTP reverse proxy redirection to a Cobalt Strike TeamServer.\nThe use of reverse proxies provides protection to backend\nC2 servers from profiling, investigation, and general internet\nbackground radiation”. Infrastructure linked to cs2modrewrite\ninstances can be set up in several different ways, including\nseparating the hosting of the reverse proxy server and Cobalt\nStrike server, or co-hosting the reverse proxy and Cobalt Strike\non the same server.\n\nOf particular interest in the repository is the file “cs2nginx.\npy”, which was last updated February 5, 2020, and whose\ncomment description states, “Converts Cobalt Strike profiles to\nNginx config file format (/etc/nginx/nginx.conf)”. The resulting\nNginx configs will “Attempt to serve files locally if they exist”,\n“Proxy any matching URIs to the C2 server”, and “Redirect any\nnon-matching requests to a specified redirection domain along\nwith the original URI”.\n\nAnalysis of cs2nginx functionality and comments reveals\noptions for modification to Nginx Cobalt Strike servers that match\ninfrastructure discovered via SOLARDEFLECTION. Insikt Group\nidentified several methods of identifying network infrastructure\nused by NOBELIUM in their intrusion operations, based on the\n[information published by Microsoft and analysis of the groups’](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/05/28/breaking-down-nobeliums-latest-early-stage-toolset/)\ninfrastructure TTPs such as banner data.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 5: cs2modrewrite Redirection method (Source: Maltego)_**\n\n##### Recurring Use of COSMICNODE\n\nAnalysis of NOBELIUM infrastructure identified multiple\nloader samples written using unique unpacking code used to\ndeploy Cobalt Strike Beacons and shellcode that Insikt Group\ninternally tracks as COSMICNODE. COSMICNODE is likely an\nevolution of the family [tracked by Sentinel One in connection](https://labs.sentinelone.com/noblebaron-new-poisoned-installers-could-be-used-in-supply-chain-attacks/)\nwith NobleBaron and by Microsoft as NativeZone. Microsoft\nhas previously [stated that NativeZone encompasses multiple](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/05/28/breaking-down-nobeliums-latest-early-stage-toolset/)\ninstances of NOBELIUM’s custom Cobalt Strike loaders, making\nit an umbrella term for any variant, to include one of the several\nnamed families detailed further below. COSMICNODE typically\nuses rundll32.exe to load and execute follow-on payload(s).\n\n\nAs of this publication, the COSMICNODE family continues\nto use new anti-analysis, encryption, and obfuscation methods\nto disguise the Cobalt Strike payloads and hamper static\ndetection of the COSMICNODE implants. NOBELIUM has [used](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/05/28/breaking-down-nobeliums-latest-early-stage-toolset/)\nAES encryption, byte swapping, multi-stage XOR encoding, and\nother obfuscation methods, suggesting a deep understanding of\nhow to hinder defender efforts to detect and analyze payloads.\nMalleable Cobalt Strike C2 Profiles enable operators to customize\nthe details of the command and control protocol used. The Cobalt\nStrike payloads have predominantly used one of two watermarks\nassociated with leaked builds, 1359593325 or 305419896, and\nthe [standard jQuery malleable profile that helps traffic blend](https://github.com/threatexpress/malleable-c2/blob/master/jquery-c2.3.11.profile)\nin by mimicking legitimate services. The previously mentioned\ntheme around typosquats of news-related entities carried over\ninto both SOLARDEFLECTION and LUNARREFLECTION C2 server\nURLs that contained similar strings pertaining to “news” or “info”\ntopics, including:\n\n - sampledomain[.]com,/news/update/aaa\n\n - sampledomain[.]com,/news_indexedimages_autrzd/\n\nInfrastructure that did not meet the criteria for either\nSOLARDEFLECTION or LUNARREFLECTION, but matched\nsignaturing for cs2modrewrite instances, which are likely to be\nCobalt Strike servers, are aggregated in Appendix A.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Victimology\n\nWith the finite data available to Recorded Future surrounding\nthis campaign, limited conclusions can be drawn regarding\nvictimology. Through behavioral profiling of network traffic to\nadversary infrastructure, we were able to determine a clear and\nconsistent pattern of SOLARDEFLECTION operators relying on\nTor to obfuscate network traffic.\n\nOverlaps with the HTML variant of EnvyScout detailed by\n[Sekoia[.]io and findings from other researchers provide invaluable](https://www.sekoia.io/en/nobeliums-envyscout-infection-chain-goes-in-the-registry-targeting-embassies/)\ninsight into likely lures such as those suspected to have targeted\nmultiple embassies. Following this first discovery, other similar\nHTML files reported by Sekoia confirmed a possible targeting\ntheme centered on “Covid information” based on the title of an\nHTML file they attributed to this campaign. This aligns with the\n[themes of the phishing emails they attributed to this campaign,](https://www.sekoia.io/en/nobeliums-envyscout-infection-chain-goes-in-the-registry-targeting-embassies/)\nlikely targeting embassies that pretended to be providing a status\nupdate about embassy operations in response to the pandemic.\n\n\n#### Mitigations\n\nThe delivery of the Cobalt Strike Beacon malware and the\nC2 communication (defined by the malleable C2 profile) are best\ndetected using intrusion detection systems (IDS) like Snort. We\nrecommend that users conduct the following measures to detect\nand mitigate activity associated with SOLARDEFLECTION:\n\n  - Configure your intrusion detection systems (IDS),\n\nintrusion prevention systems (IPS), or any network\ndefense mechanisms in place to alert on — and upon\nreview, consider blocking connection attempts to and\nfrom — the external IP addresses and domains listed in\nthe appendix.\n\n  - Recorded Future proactively detects and logs malicious\n\nserver configurations in the Command and Control\nSecurity Control Feed. The Command and Control list\nincludes tools used by NOBELIUM and other Russian\nstate-sponsored threat activity groups. Recorded Future\nclients should alert on and block these C2 servers to\nallow for detection and remediation of active intrusions.\n\n  - Recorded Future Threat Intelligence (TI), Third-Party\n\n[Intelligence, and SecOps Intelligence module users can](https://www.recordedfuture.com/license-options/)\nmonitor real-time output from Network Traffic Analysis\nanalytics to identify suspected targeted intrusion activity\ninvolving your organization or key vendors and partners.\n\n#### ● Monitor for domain abuse, such as typosquat\n domains spoofing your organization, through the Recorded Future Brand Intelligence (BI) module. The SecurityTrails extension is available to any customer that has a subscription to the Threat Intelligence or Brand Intelligence modules. The LogoType source and alerting is exclusive to the BI module, though the TI module does have ac­ cess to the data via the Advanced Query Builder.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Outlook\n\nAs tensions continue to rise in Eastern Europe, we expect\nto see a continuation of cyber operations being conducted by\nRussian-nexus groups, likely including NOBELIUM, in line with\nnational strategic interests. Russia will likely also continue to\nexert influence over other governments, which may lead to\nadditional computer network operations aimed at furthering\nstrategic advantage. Typosquatting is likely to remain an integral\ntechnique for multiple threat entities supporting Russian national\ninterests in the near future. Insikt Group has already observed\n[groups that support these interests weaponize domains themed](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ukraine-security-agency-warns-of-ghostwriter-threat-group-activity-phishing-campaigns/)\naround Russia’s invasion of Ukraine to great effect. This likely\nincludes not only the domains belonging to one organization,\nbut third-party partners and vendors with enterprise network\naccess.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Appendix A — Indicators\n\nThe following tables contain domains deemed or assessed as malicious under the heading “X.509 Certificate Domain\n(Typosquat)”, and their non-malicious associated redirect domains, under the heading “Location Domain”. All domains detailed\nin these tables should not be used to infer targeting of their respective affiliation.
