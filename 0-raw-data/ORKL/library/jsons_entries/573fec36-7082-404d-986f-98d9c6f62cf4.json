More recently, we have also seen an increase in activity**\n\n**targeting Ukraine.**\n\n**Back in 2011-2012, the group used a relatively tiny implant (known as “Sofacy” or SOURFACE) as its**\n\n**[first stage malware. The implant shared certain similarities with the old Miniduke implants. This led us](https://securelist.com/blog/incidents/31112/the-miniduke-mystery-pdf-0-day-government-spy-assembler-0x29a-micro-backdoor/)**\n\n**to believe the two groups were connected, at least to begin with, although it appears they parted ways**\n\n**[in 2014, with the original Miniduke group switching to the CosmicDuke implant.](https://securelist.com/blog/incidents/64107/miniduke-is-back-nemesis-gemina-and-the-botgen-studio/)**\n\n**At some point during 2013, the Sofacy group expanded its arsenal and added more backdoors and**\n\n**tools, including CORESHELL, SPLM (aka Xagent, aka CHOPSTICK), JHUHUGIT (which is built with**\n\n**code from the Carberp sources), AZZY (aka ADVSTORESHELL, NETUI, EVILTOSS, and spans across**\n\n**four to five generations) and a few others. We’ve seen quite a few versions of these implants and they**\n\n**were relatively widespread for a time**\n\n\n-----\n\n# mostly military and government entities in NATO countries\n\n**[Tweet](https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsecurelist.com%2Fblog%2Fresearch%2F72924%2Fsofacy-apt-hits-high-profile-targets-with-updated-toolset%2F&text=%23Sofacy+group+has+been+active+since+2008%2C+targeting+mostly+military+and+government+entities+in+NATO+countries)**\n\n**Earlier this year, we noticed a new release of the AZZY implant which, at the time, was largely**\n\n**undetected by anti-malware products. We observed several waves of attacks using this version, most**\n\n**recently in October. The new waves of attacks also included a new generation of USB stealers**\n\n**deployed by the Sofacy actor, with the first versions dating back to February 2015, and which appear to**\n\n**be geared exclusively towards high profile targets.**\n\n**In the months leading up to August, the Sofacy group launched several waves of attacks relying on**\n\n**zero-day exploits in Microsoft Office, Oracle Sun Java, Adobe Flash Player and Windows itself. For**\n\n**instance, its JHUHUGIT implant was delivered through a Flash zero-day and used a Windows EoP**\n\n**exploit to break out of the sandbox.

This separate malware was installed by an unknown attack as**\n\n**“AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\msdeltemp.dll” (md5:**\n\n**CE8B99DF8642C065B6AF43FDE1F786A3).**\n\n**The top level malware, CE8B99DF8642C065B6AF43FDE1F786A3 (named by its authors**\n\n**“msdeltemp.dll” according to internal strings, and compiled July 28th, 2015) is a rare type of the Sofacy**\n\n**AZZY implant. It has been modified to drop a separate C&C helper, (md5:**\n\n**8C4D896957C36EC4ABEB07B2802268B9) as “tf394kv.dll“.**\n\n**The dropped “tf394kv.dll” file is an external C&C communications library, compiled on July 24th, 2015**\n\n**and used by the main backdoor for all Internet-based communications.**\n\n**_Decrypted configuration block of the C&C helper library “tf394kv.dll“_**\n\n\n-----\n\n**communication functions moved to an external DLL file. In the past, the Sofacy developers modified**\n\n**earlier AZZY backdoors to use a C&C server encoded in the registry, instead of storing it in the**\n\n**malware itself, so this code modularisation follows the same line of thinking.**\n\n**In addition to the new AZZY backdoors with side-DLL for C&C, we observed a new set of data-theft**\n\n**modules deployed against victims by the Sofacy group. Among the most popular modern defense**\n\n**mechanisms against APTs are air-gaps — isolated network segments without Internet access, where**\n\n**[sensitive data is stored. In the past, we’ve seen groups such as Equation and Flame use malware to](https://securelist.com/blog/research/68750/equation-the-death-star-of-malware-galaxy/)**\n\n**steal data from air-gapped networks. The Sofacy group uses such tools as well.**\n\n**The first versions of these new USB stealer modules appeared around February 2015 and the latest**\n\n**appear to have been compiled in May 2015. Older versions of these USBSTEALER modules were**\n\n**previously described by our colleagues from ESET.**\n\n**One example of the new Sofacy USBSTEALER modules is 8b238931a7f64fddcad3057a96855f6c,**\n\n**which is named internally as msdetltemp.dll.**\n\n**This data theft module appears to have been compiled in May 2015 and is designed to watch**\n\n**removable drives and collect files from them, depending on a set of rules defined by the attackers. The**\n\n**stolen data is copied into a hidden directory as “%MYPICTURES%\\%volume serial number%“, from**\n\n**where it can be exfiltrated by the attackers using one of the AZZY implants. More details on the new**\n\n**USB stealers are available in the section on technical analysis.**\n\n**Over the last year, the Sofacy group has increased its activity almost tenfold when compared to**\n\n**previous years, becoming one of the most prolific, agile and dynamic threat actors in the arena. This**\n\n**activity spiked in July 2015 when the group dropped two completely new exploits an Office and Java**\n\n\n-----\n\n**At the beginning of August, Sofacy began a new wave of attacks, focusing on defense-related targets.**\n\n**As of November 2015, this wave of attacks is ongoing. The attackers deploy a rare modification of the**\n\n**AZZY backdoor, which is used for the initial reconnaissance. Once a foothold is established, they try to**\n\n**upload more backdoors, USB stealers as well as other hacking tools such as “Mimikatz” for lateral**\n\n**movement.**\n\n# Over the last year, the #Sofacy group has increased its activity almost tenfold, that spiked in July 2015\n\n**[Tweet](https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsecurelist.com%2Fblog%2Fresearch%2F72924%2Fsofacy-apt-hits-high-profile-targets-with-updated-toolset%2F&text=Over+the+last+year%2C+the+%23Sofacy+group+has+increased+its+activity+almost+tenfold%2C+that+spiked+in+July+2015)**\n\n**Two recurring characteristics of the Sofacy group that we keep seeing in its attacks are speed and the**\n\n**use of multi-backdoor packages for extreme resilience. In the past, the group used droppers that**\n\n**installed both the SPLM and AZZY backdoors on the same machine. If one of them was detected, the**\n\n**other one provided the attacker with continued access.**\n\n**As usual, the best defense against targeted attacks is a multi-layered approach. Combine traditional**\n\n**anti-malware technologies with patch management, host intrusion detection and, ideally, whitelisting**\n\n**and default-deny strategies. According to a study by the Australian DSD, 85% of the targeted attacks**\n\n**analysed could have been stopped by four simple defense strategies. While it’s impossible to achieve**\n\n**100% protection, in practice and most cases all you have to do is increase your defenses to the point**\n\n**where it becomes too expensive for the attacker – who will just give up and move on to other targets.**\n\n**More information about the Sofacy group is available to customers of** **[Kaspersky Intelligent Services.](http://www.kaspersky.com/business-security/entrp/apt)**\n\n**Is there a ‘silver bullet’ to protect yourself against Sofacy?
