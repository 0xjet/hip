The UK and US are\ncalling out Russia’s malicious behaviour, to enable our international partners and\nbusinesses at home to better defend and prepare themselves against this kind of\naction.\n\nThe UK will continue to work with allies to call out Russia’s malign behaviour where we\nsee it.\n\nThe UK can today also reveal for the first time that Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service\n(SVR) was behind a series of cyber intrusions, including the SolarWinds compromise.\n\n\n-----\n\nGCHQ s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) assess that it is highly likely the SVR was\nresponsible for gaining unauthorised access to SolarWinds “Orion” software and subsequent\ntargeting.\n\nThese incidents are part of a wider pattern of cyber intrusions by the SVR who have\npreviously attempted to gain access to governments across Europe and NATO members.\n\nSince the SolarWinds vulnerability was uncovered, NCSC have been conducting extensive\nactivity to understand and mitigate the compromise. While the overall impact on the UK of\nthe SVR’s exploitation of this software is low, the NCSC has identified a low single digit\nnumber of public sector organisations targeted through the SolarWinds vulnerability. The\ngovernment, including the NCSC, has been working hard to ensure those affected were\nrapidly mitigated.\n\nIn addition, the UK government is today making available further information about the SVR’s\n[cyber programme available here](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/russia-uk-exposes-russian-involvement-in-solarwinds-cyber-compromise)\n\nMedia enquiries\n\n[Email newsdesk@fcdo.gov.uk](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:newsdesk@fcdo.gov.uk)\n\nTelephone 020 7008 3100\n\nContact the FCDO Communication Team via email (monitored 24 hours a day) in the first\ninstance, and we will respond as soon as possible.\n\nWe use some essential cookies to make this website work.\n\nWe’d like to set additional cookies to understand how you use GOV.UK, remember your\nsettings and improve government services.\n\nWe also use cookies set by other sites to help us deliver content from their services.\n\n\n-----",
