Later on, the malware variant will\nstart the endless loop, querying for the GUID-named file in a certain folder on the C&C server.

In an endless loop, the malware variant queries a given path on the C&C server, trying to\n\ndownload a GUID-named file with commands to execute.\n\n**Other MuddyWater campaigns in the first half of 2019**\n\nThe MuddyWater threat actor group has been actively targeting victims with a variety of tricks, and they\nseem to keep on adding more as they move forward with new campaigns. The campaign that used\nPOWERSTATS v3 is not the only one we found with new tricks. We observed other campaigns that\nchanged their delivery methods and dropped file types. Notably, these campaigns have also changed\npayloads and publicly available post-exploitation tools.\n\n\n-----\n\n|2019-01|Macros|EXE|SHARPSTATS|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|2019-01|Macros|INF, EXE|DELPHSTATS|\n|2019-03|Macros|Base64 encoded, BAT|POWERSTATS v2|\n|2019-04|Template injection|Document with macros|POWERSTATS v1 or v2|\n|2019-05|Macros|VBE|POWERSTATS v3|\n\n\n2019-01 Macros INF, EXE DELPHSTATS\n\n2019-03 Macros Base64 encoded, BAT POWERSTATS v2\n\n2019-04 Template injection Document with macros POWERSTATS v1 or\n\nv2\n\n2019-05 Macros VBE POWERSTATS v3\n\nTable 1. MuddyWater’s delivery methods and payloads in 2019 1H\n\nIn January 2019, we discovered that the campaign started using SHARPSTATS, a .NET-written\nbackdoor that supports DOWNLOAD, UPLOAD, and RUN functions. In the same month,\nDELPHSTATS, a backdoor written in the Delphi programming language, emerged. DELPHSTATS\n\nqueries the C&C server for a .dat file before executing it via the Powershell.exe process. Like\nSHARPSTATS, DELPHSTATS employs custom PowerShell script with code similarities to the one\nembedded into the former.\n\nFigure 8. SHARPSTATS can be used to collect system information by dropping and executing a\n\nPowerShell script.\n\nFigure 9. The code in DELPHSTATS that queries a certain directory on the C&C server. It’s where\n\noperators upload additional payload.\n\nWe came across the heavily obfuscated POWERSTATS v2 in March 2019. An earlier version of this\nbackdoor decodes the initial encoded/compressed blocks of code, while an improved version appeared\nlater on. The latter heavily uses format strings and redundant backtick characters. The function names\nin the earlier version were still somehow readable, but they were completely randomized in later\n\nversions.\n\nFigure 10. Obfuscated POWERSTATS v2\n\nAfter deobfuscation, the main backdoor loop queries different URLs for a “Hello server” message to\nobtain command and upload the result of the run command to the C&C server.\n\n\n-----\n\n|Name of the Post-Exploitation Tool|Programming language/Interpreter|\n|---|---|\n|CrackMapExec|Python, PyInstaller|\n|ChromeCookiesView|Executable file|\n|chrome-passwords|Executable file|\n|EmpireProject|PowerShell, Python|\n|FruityC2|PowerShell|\n|Koadic|JavaScript|\n|LaZagne|Python, PyInstaller|\n|Meterpreter|Reflective loader, executable file|\n|Mimikatz|Executable file|\n|MZCookiesView|Executable file|\n|PowerSploit|PowerShell|\n|Shootback|Python, PyInstaller|\n|Smbmap|Python, PyInstaller|\n\n\nWe also observed MuddyWater s use of multiple open source post-exploitation tools, which they\n\ndeployed after successfully compromising a target.\n\n**Name of the Post-Exploitation Tool** **Programming language/Interpreter**\n\n[CrackMapExec](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/CrackMapExec) Python, PyInstaller\n\n[ChromeCookiesView](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/chrome_cookies_view.html) Executable file\n\n[chrome-passwords](https://github.com/adnan-alhomssi/chrome-passwords) Executable file\n\n[EmpireProject](https://github.com/EmpireProject) PowerShell, Python\n\n[FruityC2](https://github.com/xtr4nge/FruityC2) PowerShell\n\n[Koadic](https://github.com/zerosum0x0/koadic) JavaScript\n\n[LaZagne](https://github.com/AlessandroZ/LaZagne) Python, PyInstaller\n\n[Meterpreter](https://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/about-meterpreter/) [Reflective loader, executable file](https://github.com/stephenfewer/ReflectiveDLLInjection)\n\n[Mimikatz](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz) Executable file\n\n[MZCookiesView](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/mzcv.html) Executable file\n\n[PowerSploit](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit) PowerShell\n\n[Shootback](https://github.com/aploium/shootback) Python, PyInstaller\n\n[Smbmap](https://github.com/ShawnDEvans/smbmap) Python, PyInstaller\n\nTable 2. Tools used by MuddyWater campaigns over the years.\n\nThe delivery of the EmpireProject stager is notable in one of the campaigns that we monitored. The\n\n[scheme involves the use of template injection and the abuse of the CVE-2017-11882 vulnerability. If](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-11882)\nthe email recipient clicks on a malicious document, a remote template is downloaded, which will trigger\n\nthe exploitation of CVE-2017-11882. This will then lead to the execution the EmpireProject stager.\n\nFigure 12. Clicking on the malicious document leads to the abuse of CVE-2017-11882 and the\n\nexecution of the EmpireProject stager.\n\nAnother campaign also stands out for its use of the LaZagne credential dumper, which was patched to\ndrop and run POWERSTATS in the main function.\n\nFigure 13. LaZagne has been patched to drop and run POWERSTATS in the main function. See added\n\n_intimoddumpers() function. Note the typo in the function name – its INTI, not INIT._\n\n**Conclusion and security recommendations**\n\nWhile MuddyWater appears to have no access to zero-days and advanced malware variants, it still\n\nmanaged to compromise its targets. This can be attributed to the constant development of their\nschemes.\n\nNotably, the group’s use of email as an infection vector seems to yield success for their campaigns.
