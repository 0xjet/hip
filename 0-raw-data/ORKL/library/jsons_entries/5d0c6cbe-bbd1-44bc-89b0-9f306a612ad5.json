As the investigation progressed, Talos came to understand that this campaign\n\n\n-----\n\nwas associated with the ChristinaMorrow text message spam scam previously spotted in\nAustralia.\n\nAlthough this malware's credential-harvest mechanism is not particularly sophisticated, it\ndoes have an advanced self-preservation mechanism. Even though this is not a traditional\nremote access tool (RAT), this campaign seems to target mainly private users. Aside from\nthe credential stealing, this malware also includes features like the theft of users' contact list,\ncollecting phone numbers associated names, and files and photos on the device. But that\ndoesn't mean companies and organizations are out of the woods. They should still be on the\nlookout for these kinds of trojans, as the attackers could target corporate accounts that\ncontain large amounts of money.\n\nThe information collected by the malware and the control over the victim's mobile device\nallows their operators to perform more complex social engineering attacks. A motivated\nattacker can use this trojan to harvest usernames and passwords and then reuse them to\nlogin into the organization's system where the victim works. This is a good example where\ntwo-factor authentication based on SMS would fail since the attacker can read the SMS.\nCorporations can protect themselves from these side-channel attacks by deploying client[based two-factor authentication, such as Duo Security.](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/adaptive-multi-factor-authentication.html)\n\nOne of the most impressive features of this malware is its resilience. If the command and\ncontrol (C2) server is taken down, the malicious operator can still recover the malware\ncontrol by sending SMS messages directly to the infected devices. This makes the taking\ndown and recovery of the network much harder and poses a considerable challenge for\ndefenders.\n\n## The campaign\n\nThe malware's primary infection vector is SMS. Just like the old-school mail worms that used\nthe victim's address book to select the next victims, this banking trojan's activation cycle\nincludes the exfiltration of the victim's address book. The trojan will receive instructions from\nthe C2 to spread.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Spread command from C2_\n\nThe victim receives the command sendSMSMass. Usually, this message targets four or five\npeople at a time. The body contains a message and URL. Again, the concept is that new\nvictims are more likely to install the malware if the SMS comes from someone they know.\nWhen a victim tries to access the URL in the SMS body, the C2 will check if the mobile\ndevice meets the criteria to receive the malware (see infrastructure section). If the device\ndoes not meet the criteria, it won't receive any data, otherwise, it will be redirected to a\nsecond server to receive a copy of the malware to install on their device.\n\nThe domain on this campaign was registered on Jan. 19, 2019. However, Talos has identified\nthat was used at least since November 2018. During the investigation, Talos was also able to\ndetermine that the same infrastructure has been used to deploy similar campaigns using\ndifferent versions of the malware.\n\n\n-----\n\nDistribution of victims.\n\nTalos assess with high confidence that this campaign is targeting Australian financial\ninstitutions based on several factors. Our Umbrella telemetry shows that the majority of the\nrequest comes from Australia and the majority of the phone numbers infected have the\ninternational indicative for Australia. Finally, the specific overlays are designed for Australian\nfinancial institutions, and Australia is one of the geographic regions that is accepted by the\nC2.\n\n_DNS queries distribution over time_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe campaign doesn't seem to be growing at a fast pace. Our data shows, on average,\nabout three requests per hour to the drop host. This request is only made upon installation,\nbut there is no guarantee that it will be installed. This data, when analyzed with the number\nof commands to send SMSs that Talos received during the investigation, lead us to conclude\nthat the malicious operator is aggressively spreading the malware, but that doesn't seem to\nresult in the same number of new infections.\n\n_Examples of the overlays available to the malware_\n\nAbove, you can see examples of the injections that distributed to the malware as part of this\nspecific campaign.\n\nWhile doing our investigation we were able to identify other malware packages with different\nnames. Some of these might have been used on old campaigns or were already prepared for\nnew campaigns.\n\n## Malware technical details\n\n[During our investigation, researchers uncovered a malware known as \"Gustuff.\" . Given the](https://www.cyberscoop.com/gustuff-malware-mobile-banking-apps/)\nlack of indicators of compromise, we decided to check to see if this was the same malware\nwe had been researching. Our Threat Intelligence and Interdiction team found the Gustuff\nmalware being advertised in the Exploit.in forum as a botnet for rent. The seller, known as\n\"bestoffer,\" was, at some point, expelled from the forum.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Gustuff advertising screenshot_\n\nThe companies advertised in the image above were from Australia, which matches up with\nthe campaign we researched. The screenshots provided by the author align with the\nadvertised features and the features that we discovered while doing our analysis.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Admin panel_\n\nThe administration panel shows the application configuration, which matches the commands\nfrom the C2.\n\n_Country selection_\n\nThe administration console screenshots also show the ability to filter the results by country.\nIn this case, \"AU\" is the code shown, which is Australia.\n\n\n-----\n\nBased on this information, Talos assesses with high confidence that the malware is the same\nand this is, in fact, the Gustuff malware.\n\n### Design\n\nIn the manifest, the malware requests a large number of permissions. However, it doesn't\nrequest permissions like BIND_ADMIN. To perform some of its activities, the malware does\nnot need high privileges inside the device, as we will explain ahead.\n\n_Permissions in the manifest_\n\nThis malware is designed to avoid detection and analysis. It has several protections in place,\nboth in the C2 and the malware's code. The code is not only obfuscated but also packed.\nThe packer, besides making the static analysis more complex, will break the standard\ndebugger.\n\n_Manifest activity declaration_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Class list inside the dex file_\n\nThe main malware classes are packed, to a point where the class defined in the manifest\nhas a handler for the MAIN category that does not exist in the DEX file.\n\n_Error when trying to debug the malware using the Android Studio IDE._\n\nOne of the side effects of this packer is the inability of Android Studio IDE to debug the code.\nThis happens because the IDE executes the code from the Android debug bridge (ADB) by\ncalling the activity declared in the manifest by name. Since the class does not exist at\nstartup, the application does not run on the debugger. Although Talos analyzed the unpacked\nversion of the code, the packer analysis is beyond the scope of this post.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Check code for emulators_\n\nAs part of its defense, the malware payload first checks for emulators to prevent analysis on\nsandboxes. It checks for different kinds of emulators, including QEMU, Genymotion,\nBlueStacks and Bignox. If the malware determines that is not running on an emulator, it then\nperforms additional checks to ensure that it won't be detected.\n\n_Code to check the existence of SafetyNet Google API_\n\nIt also checks if the Android SafetyNet is active and reporting back to the C2. This helps the\n\n\n-----\n\nC2 define what actions it can do before being detected on the mobile device.\n\n_List of anti-virus packages that are checked_\n\nThe payload goes a long way to protect itself and checks for anti-virus software installed on\nthe mobile device. The trojan uses the Android Accessibility API to intercept all interactions\nbetween the user and the mobile device.\n\nThe Android developer documentation describes the accessibility event class as a class that\n\"represents accessibility events that are seen by the system when something notable\nhappens in the user interface. For example, when a button is clicked, a view is focused, etc.\"\n\nFor each interaction, the malware will check if the generator is a package that belongs to the\nanti-virus list, the malware will abuse another feature of the Accessibility API. There is a\nfunction called \"performGlobalAction\" with the description below.\n\nAndroid documentation describes that function as \"a global action. Such an action can be\nperformed at any moment, regardless of the current application or user location in that\napplication. For example, going back, going home, opening recents, etc.\"\n\n[The trojan calls this function with the action GLOBAL_ACTION_BACK, which equals the](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/accessibilityservice/AccessibilityService.html%23GLOBAL_ACTION_BACK)\npressing of the back button on the device, thus canceling the opening of the anti-virus\napplication.\nThe same event interception is used to place the webview overlay when the user tries to\naccess the targeted applications, allowing it to display its overlay, thus intercepting the\ncredentials.\n\nThe beaconing only starts after the application is installed and removed from the running\ntasks.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Beaconing information_\n\nThe ID is generated for each installation of the malware, while the token remains unique.\nSome of the checks performed previously are immediately sent to the C2, like the safetyNet,\nadmin and defaultSMSApp. The beaconing is sent to the URL\nhttp://<SERVER>/api/v2/get.php with an interval of 60 seconds.\n\n_Answer from the C2_\n\nThe C2 will check the country field, if it's empty or if the country is not targeted, it will reply\nwith a \"Unauthorized\" answer. Otherwise, it will return a JSON encoded \"OK,\" and if that is\nthe case, the command to be executed.\n\n\n-----\n\n_List of available commands_\n\nThe command names are self-explanatory. The command will be issued as an answer to the\nbeaconing, and the result will be returned to the URL http://<SERVER>/api/v2/set_state.php\n\n\n-----\n\n_Example of the command \"changeServer\"_\n\nThe commands are issued in a JSON format, and the obfuscation is part of the malware\ncode and not added by the packer. It is a custom obfuscation partly based on base85\nencoding, which is in itself unusual, in malware. Base85 encoding is usually used on pdf and\npostscript documentsThe configuration of the malware is stored in custom preferences files,\nusing the same obfuscation scheme.\n\n### Activation cycle\n\nAs we have explained above, the malware has several defence mechanisms. Beside the\nobfuscation and the environment checks, the malware also has some interesting antisandbox mechanisms.\n\nAfter installation, the user needs to run the application. The user needs to press the \"close\"\nbutton to finish the installation. However, this won't close the application, it will send it to the\nbackground, instead. While the application is in the background, although the service is\nalready running, the beaconing will not start. The beaconing will only start after the\napplication is removed from the background, ultimately stopping it. This will be the trigger for\nthe service to start the beaconing.\n\nAs mentioned previously, the beaconing is done every 60 seconds. However, no command is\nreceived from the C2 until the inactiveTime field (see beaconing information image above)\nhas at least the value of 2000000. This time resets every time the user performs some\nactivity.\n\nAfter the checks, the malware becomes active, but first, it goes through seven steps, each\none calling a different command:\n\n\n-----\n\n1. uploadPhoneNumbers: Exfiltrates all phone numbers that are in the contact list. Aside\n\nfrom the natural value of phone numbers associated with the names of their owners.\nUsing the SMS has an initial infection vector is another possibility for the exfiltration.\nOne of the purposes of the exfiltration of the contact list is to use them to attack other\nvictims using SMS as an initial vector.\n2. checkApps: Asks the malware to see if the packages sent as parameters are installed.\n\nThe malware contains a list of 209 packages hardcoded in its source code. However,\nthe C2 can send an updated list.\n\n_List of packages received from the C2_\n\n3. adminNumber: Setup of the admin phone number. In our case, the administrator phone\n\nnumber belongs to a mobile network in Australia.\n\n_Phone number for administration_\n\n4. changeServer: At this point, the malware changes the C2 to a new host, even though\n\nthe API and communication protocol continues to be the same.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Change server request_\n\nThe URL's for the new server is obfuscated, preventing easy network identification.\n\n5. changeActivity: This command will set up the webview to overlay any of the target\n\nactivities.\n\n_changeActivity command_\n\nThe webview injects are not hosted on the C2, they are hosted on a completely\ndifferent server.\n6. params: This command allows the malicious operator to change configuration\n\nparameters in the malware. During this stage of the activation cycle, the malware\nincreases the beaconing time to avoid detection.\n\n_Command to change the beaconing_\n\n7. changeArchive: The final command of the activation cycle is the download of an\n\narchive. This archive is stored in the same host has the webviews. The archive is a ZIP\ncontaining several files, which is protected with a password.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Change archive command_\n\nAfter this activation cycle, the malware will start the collection of information activities and\ndissemination.\n\n### Malicious activity\n\nOnce the activation cycle ends, the trojan will start its malicious activities. These activities\ndepend on the device configuration. Depending if the victim has any of the targeted\napplications, the anti-virus installed or geographic location, the malware can harvest\ncredentials from the targeted applications, exfiltrate all personal information or simply use the\nvictim's device to send SMS to spread the trojan\n\nThe malware deploys overlaying webviews to trick the user and eventually steal their login\ncredentials. These are adapted to the information the malicious operator wants to retrieve.\nThe first webview overlay is created on step 6 of the activation cycle.\n\n_Pin request overlay_\n\n\n-----\n\nThis overlay asks the user to provide their PIN to unlock the mobile device, which is\nimmediately exfiltrated to the C2. The last step of the activation cycle is the download of a\npassword-protected ZIP file. This file contains all HTML, CSS and PNG files necessary to\ncreate overlays. Talos found 189 logos from banks to cryptocurrency exchanges inside the\narchive, all of which could be targeted. The archive also contained all the necessary codes to\ntarget Australian financial institutions. The overlays are activated by the malicious operator\nusing the command changeActivity, as seen on step 5 of the activation cycle. In this case, we\ncan see that the HTML code of the overlay is stored in the C2 infrastructure. However, since\nthe archive that is downloaded into the device has all the necessary information and the\nmalicious actor has access to the device via SMS, the malicious operator can keep its\nactivity even without the C2 infrastructure.\n\n### Infrastructure\n\nThe infrastructure supporting this malware is rather complex. It is clear that on all stages\nthere are at least two layers.\n\nThe infrastructure has several layers, although not being very dynamic, still has several\nlayers each one providing some level of protection. All the IP addresses belong to the same\ncompany Hetzner, an IP-hosting firm in Germany.\n\n## Coverage\n\n\n-----\n\n[Cisco Cloud Web Security (CWS) or
