On March 3, 2021, the same samples were served\n[from a third IP address, with the addition of an exploit leveraging CVE-2021-22502. Furthermore, on March 13, an exploit](https://github.com/pedrib/PoC/blob/master/advisories/Micro_Focus/Micro_Focus_OBR.md)\ntargeting [CVE-2020-26919 was also incorporated into the samples.](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26919)\n\nThe attacks are still ongoing at the time of this writing. Upon successful exploitation, the attackers try to download a malicious\nshell script, which contains further infection behaviors such as downloading and executing Mirai variants and brute-forcers.\n\n[Palo Alto Networks Next-Generation Firewall customers with](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/next-generation-firewall) [Threat Prevention,](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/secure-the-network/subscriptions/threat-prevention) [WildFire and](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/secure-the-network/wildfire) [URL Filtering security](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/threat-detection-and-prevention/web-security)\n[subscriptions, as well as AutoFocus can detect and block all the exploit attempts from this kind of malware family.](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cortex/autofocus)\n\n## Vulnerabilities Being Exploited\n\nFive known vulnerabilities and three unknown vulnerabilities were exploited in this attack. Upon successful exploitation, the\nwget utility is invoked to download a shell script from the malware infrastructure. The shell script then downloads several Mirai\nbinaries compiled for different architectures and executes these downloaded binaries one by one.

List of vulnerabilities._\n\n**Exploit Payloads**\n\n1. VisualDoor: SonicWall SSL-VPN Remote Command Injection Vulnerability\n\n\nUnknown\n\n\nFigure 1. VisualDoor SonicWall SSL-VPN exploit payload.\nThe exploit of SonicWall SSL-VPN targets an old version of Bash, which is vulnerable to ShellShock. An attacker can send a\ncrafted Common Gateway Interface (CGI) request to a particular shell script leading to an unauthenticated remote code\nexecution (RCE) vulnerability.\n\n2. CVE-2020-25506: D-Link DNS-320 Firewall Remote Command Execution Vulnerability\n\nFigure 2. D-Link DNS-320 exploit payload.\nThe exploit targets a command injection vulnerability in a system_mgr.cgi component. The component does not successfully\nsanitize the value of the HTTP parameters f_ntp_server, which in turn leads to arbitrary command execution.\n\n3. CVE-2021-27561 and CVE-2021-27562: Yealink Device Management Pre-Auth ‘root’ Level Remote Code Execution\nVulnerability\n\nFigure 3. Yealink Device exploit payload\n\n\n-----\n\nThe exploit works by chaining a pre auth Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability and a command injection\nvulnerability, making it possible to execute commands as root without authentication, simply by sending an HTTPS request to\nthe remote target.\n\n4. CVE-2021-22502: Micro Focus Operation Bridge Reporter (OBR) Remote Code Execution\n\nFigure 4. Micro Focus Operation Bridge Reporter exploit payload.\nThe exploit works due to the unsanitized use of the “username” and “password” parameters in requests made to the\nLogonResource API. The vulnerability can be exploited to allow unauthenticated RCE as root on the OBR server.\n\n5. CVE-2019-19356: Netis WF2419 Wireless Router Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\n\nFigure 5. Netis WF2419 exploit payload.\nThe exploit targets an RCE vulnerability in a diagnostic tool utility. An authenticated attacker can perform command execution\nvia multiple vulnerable parameters such as IP address or domain name.\n\n6. CVE-2020-26919: Netgear ProSAFE Plus Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\n\nFigure 6. Netgear ProSAFE exploit payload.\nThe exploit targets debug web sections and an attacker can execute system commands through it. This is due to lack of\nproper checks on access controls leading to RCE with administrator privileges.\n\n7. Unidentified vulnerability (lang parameter command injection)\n\nFigure 7. Unidentified vulnerability exploit payload.\nThe exploit of an unidentified vulnerability targets a command injection vulnerability in certain components. The component\ndoes not successfully sanitize the value of the HTTP parameter lang, which in turn leads to arbitrary command execution.\n\n\n-----\n\n8. Unidentified vulnerability (key parameter command injection)\n\nFigure 8. Unidentified vulnerability exploit payload.\nThe unknown exploit targets the login CGI script, where a key parameter is not properly sanitized leading to a command\ninjection.\n\n9. Unknown vulnerability (op_type parameter command injection)\n\nFigure 9. Unidentified vulnerability exploit payload.\nThis exploit targets the op_type parameter, which is not properly sanitized leading to a command injection. It has been\nobserved in the past being used by Moobot, however the exact target is unknown.\n\n## Malware Behaviors\n\n**Binary** **Functionality**\n\nlolol.sh After deleting some key folders from the target machine (such as ones containing the existing scheduled jobs,\nas well as startup scripts), this script downloads the “dark” binaries explained below, saves them to a\nmisleadingly named file “nginx” and tries to run each one. Since the “dark” binaries downloaded are each\ncompiled for a different architecture, only the one compatible with the target machine would actually execute.\nFollowing that, it schedules a job that would (supposedly) run every hour to rerun the lolol.sh script. However,\nthe cron configuration is incorrect. This would have been an attempt to ensure the process is re-launched in\ncase it crashes or is killed for some other reason.\n\nFinally, several packet filter rules are created to block incoming traffic directed at commonly used ports like the\nstandard SSH, HTTP and telnet ports, among others. This is probably to make maintenance of and remote\naccess to the affected system more challenging for an administrator.\n\nIn one of the two observed versions of the script, it also downloads and runs the “install.sh” script described\nbelow.\n\ninstall.sh This script downloads GoLang v1.9.4 onto the target system and adds it to the system path. In addition, it also\ninstalls the GoLang standard SSH package and zmap (a common network-scanning package).\nIt also downloads the “nbrute” binaries and the “combo.txt” file described below. As was the case for the\nprevious script, the “nbrute” binaries downloaded are each compiled for a different architecture, increasing the\nprobability of compatibility with the target machine.\n\nFinally, zmap is run to scan port 22, and IPs found with port 22 open are sent as input to the nbrute binary.\n\n\nnbrute.\n\n[arch]\n\n\nThese binaries are written in GoLang and mainly serve the purpose of brute-forcing the various credentials\nfound in “combo.txt” while initiating an SSH connection with a certain IP.\n\n\ncombo.txt Plain text file containing numerous combinations of credentials (often default credentials on devices).\n\n\ndark.\n\n[arch]\n\n\nThese binaries are based on the Mirai codebase, and mainly serve the purpose of propagation – either using\nthe exploits described in the section above, or by brute-forcing SSH connections using some hard-coded\ncredentials in the binary.\nThe key used for the standard Mirai byte-wise XOR encryption routine is 0xbaadf00d.\n\n\n_Table 2 Malware behaviors_\n\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe IoT realm remains an easily accessible target for attackers. Many vulnerabilities are very easy to exploit and could, in\nsome cases, have catastrophic consequences.
