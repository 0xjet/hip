This ransomware shows\nthat new threat actors are continuing to enter the ransomware market at a rapid pace due to\nthe lucrative nature of this business model. As a result, greater numbers of unique\nransomware families are emerging at a faster rate. This sometimes results in complex\nvariants emerging or in other cases, like this one, less sophisticated ones. In many cases\nthese new ransomware threats share little resemblance to some of the more established\noperations in their approach to infecting systems, encrypting/removing files, or the way in\nwhich they attempt to coerce victims into complying with their ransom demands.\n\nRanscam is one of these new ransomware variants. It lacks complexity and also tries to use\nvarious scare tactics to entice the user to paying, one such method used by Ranscam is to\ninform the user they will delete their files during every unverified payment click, which turns\nout to be a lie. There is no longer honor amongst thieves. Similar to threats like AnonPop,\nRanscam simply delete victims’ files, and provides yet another example of why threat actors\ncannot always be trusted to recover a victim’s files, even if the victim complies with the\nransomware author’s demands. With some organizations likely choosing to pay the\n\n\n-----\n\nransomware author following an infection, Ranscam further justifies the importance of\nensuring that you have a sound, offline backup strategy in place rather than a sound ransom\npayout strategy. Not only does having a good backup strategy in place help ensure that\nsystems can be restored, it also ensures that attackers are no longer able to collect revenue\nthat they can then reinvest into the future development of their criminal enterprise.\n\n## Infection Details\n\n### Ransom Note\n\nThe first thing a compromised user would likely notice is the ransom note that is displayed by\nthe malware, and it is interesting for several reasons. First, it purports to have moved the\nuser’s files to a “hidden, encrypted partition” rather than simply leaving the files encrypted in\ntheir current storage location. Additionally, it is displayed by the malware after each reboot\nfollowing the initial compromise. It consists of a JPEG that is temporarily stored on the user’s\ndesktop, as well as two framed elements that are remotely retrieved using Internet Explorer\neach time the note is displayed.\n\nIn the lower portion (which is the portion rendered using elements gathered from various web\nservers using Internet Explorer), rather than directing users to an external location to verify\ntheir payment it contains a clickable button that when pressed claims that it is verifying\n\n\n-----\n\npayment. It will then display a verification failure notice and the ransom note threatens to\ndelete one file each time the button is clicked without payment having been submitted.\n\nWhat is actually occurring is the malware is simply making two HTTP GET requests to obtain\nthe PNG images that it uses to simulate the verification process. There is no actual\nverification occurring.\n\nThe unfortunate reality is, all of the user’s files have already been deleted and are\nunrecoverable by the ransomware author as there is no capability built into Ranscam that\nactually provides recovery functionality. The author is simply relying on “smoke and mirrors”\nin an attempt to convince victims that their files can be recovered in hopes that they will\nchoose to pay the ransom. The lack of any encryption (and decryption) within this malware\nsuggests this adversary is looking to ‘make a quick buck’ - it is not sophisticated in anyway\nand lacks functionality which is associated with other ransomware such as Cryptowall.\n\n### What Actually Happens\n\nThis ransomware is packaged as a .NET executable that is signed using a digital certificate\nissued by reca[.]net. On the sample analyzed, this digital certificate appears to have been\nissued on July 06, 2016.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen the victim executes this file, it performs several actions to maintain persistence on the\nsystem. First, it copies itself into %APPDATA%\\ and uses Task Scheduler to create a\nscheduled task that is configured to start itself each time the system is started. Additionally, it\nunpacks and drops an executable into %TEMP%\\.\n\nThe executable called by this scheduled task uses the Windows Command Processor to call\na batch file which is responsible for the majority of the destructive activity associated with this\nransomware.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe batch file simply iterates through several folders within the victim’s file system, mainly\nuser profile folders as well as several defined application directories, however instead of\nencrypting the victim’s files, it simply deletes all contents.\n\nThe script also performs several other destructive actions on the infected system, including\nthe following:\n\nDeleting the core Windows executable responsible for System Restores\nDeleting shadow copies\nDeleting several registry key associated with booting into Safe Mode\n\n\n-----\n\nSetting registry keys to disable Task Manager\nSetting the Keyboard Scancode Map\n\nThe script then uses powershell to facilitate the retrieval of the JPEG used to render the\nransom note.\n\nOnce the aforementioned activities are completed, the script then forces a system shutdown.\nThese activities are repeated each time the system boots up following the infection, with the\nscheduled task calling the malware to check for new files in various directories and deleting\nthem if they exist, displaying the ransom note and eventually forcing a system shutdown.\n\nAn open file listing from the web server hosting the contents used by the ransom note is\nbelow. We identified this on one of the threat actor’s web servers which used a default\nconfiguration - no attempt was (or has) been made by the attacker to obfuscate this data.\n\nDuring our analysis we were “coincidentally” unable to successfully perform the required\nBitcoin transaction and requested that the ransomware author send us payout instructions\nvia an email we registered.\n\nShortly after making our request, we received the following email:\n\n\n-----\n\nWe then decided to see what we could find out about this threat actor by asking them to help\nus out with submitting the payout.\n\nA couple of hours later we received the following response with further instructions as well as\nthe “helpful” recommendation that we make the payment prior to bank closure the following\nday.\n\nUnfortunately we were unable to elicit further communication from the threat actor, however\nthis highlights the continued willingness of ransomware operations to provide ongoing\ntechnical support to victims to maximize the likelihood that they will receive payouts.\n\nThe adversaries decided using Bitcoin would be a sensible approach as they most likely\nbelieve the anonymity factor can be employed and that they can’t get caught, however, one\nmajor opsec failure was featured here, address re-use. The attackers provided and used the\nsame wallet address for all payments and for all samples Talos encountered. The address in\nquestion was:\n\n1G6tQeWrwp6TU1qunLjdNmLTPQu7PnsMYd\n\n\n-----\n\nWe reviewed all transactions associated with this address and found a total of $277.61 had\nbeen transacted suggesting the attackers have used this wallet previous to releasing this\nshoddy implementation of ransomware -- we based this on the fact that the digital signature\nused to sign this executable was issued on July 6th. There have been no transactions\nassociated with this wallet since 29th June 2016.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAs Ranscam shows, threat actors cannot simply be trusted and often use deception as a\nmeans to achieve their objective, which in this case is convincing victims to pay out. This is\nbecause they never intended on providing a means to retrieve or recover the victim’s files in\nthe first place.\n\nCurrently the Ranscam campaign does not appear to be widespread and there have been no\nlarge-scale email spam campaigns currently leveraging this scareware. Ranscam shows the\ndesire of adversaries to enter the ransomware/scareware arena. They do not need to use\nnovel attacks or even fully functional ransomware, as seen here, this appears to be an\namateur malware author and is not a sophisticated campaign. The main component of\nRanscam is scaring victims into paying, and they do not even manage to facilitate that at\ntimes due to failures in the frame rendering used to deliver their malware payment screen.\n\nThe key takeaway Talos would like to offer is that a comprehensive backup solution which\ncan offer a realistic recovery time objective (RTO) is key to battling ransomware. Maintaining\nthe ability to bring an infected system back to a known-good configuration as quickly as\npossible should be the goal. This ensures that adversaries do not benefit from revenue\nstreams that they can use to further refine their tactics, techniques and procedures.\n\nAdditionally, these backups should be tested at a regular periodicity to ensure that they\nremain functional, effective, and continue to meet the needs of the organization as those\nneeds may change over time.\n\nBy paying ransomware authors, organizations are contributing to the proliferation of\nransomware by providing threat actors with the capital necessary to mature their capabilities\nand infect future victims. Additionally, organizations that pay their attackers make themselves\na target for future compromise if they are not successful in or otherwise lack the capability\nneeded to ensure that they have fully eradicated the source of their initial compromise. They\nalso identify themselves as organizations that are willing to pay ransoms, thus they may be\ntargeted more often as threat actors know that they have a higher likelihood of making\nmoney by successfully infecting them.\n\n## Coverage\n\nAdditional ways our customers can detect and block this threat are listed below.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) is ideally suited to prevent the execution of the](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/security/amp-firepower-software-license/tsd-products-support-series-home.html)\nmalware used by these threat actors.\n[CWS or](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/cloud-web-security/index.html) [WSA web scanning prevents access to malicious websites and detects malware](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/web-security-appliance/index.html)\nused in these attacks.\n[The Network Security protection of IPS and](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/intrusion-prevention-system-ips/index.html) [NGFW have up-to-date signatures to detect](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/asa-next-generation-firewall-services/index.html)\nmalicious network activity by threat actors.\n[ESA can block malicious emails sent by threat actors as part of their campaign.](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/email-security-appliance/index.html)\n\n## Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)\n\n### Hashes:\n\n9541fadfa0c779bcbae5f2567f7b163db9384b7ff6d44f525fea3bb2322534de   (SHA256)\n\n7a22d6a14a600eee1c4de9716c3003e92f002f2df3e774983807a3f86ca50539  (SHA256)\n\nB3fd732050d9b0b0f32fafb0c5d3eb2652fd6463e0ec91233b7a72a48522f71a  (SHA256)\n\n### Hosts Contacted:\n\ns3-us-west-1[.]amazonaws[.]com  54.231.237.25\n\ncrypted[.]site88[.]net            31.170.162.63\n\npublicocolombiano[.]com        192.185.71.136\n\nwww[.]waldorftrust[.]com       205.144.171.114\n\ncryptoglobalbank[.]com         31.170.160.179\n\n### Files Dropped:\n\n%APPDATA%\\winstrsp.exe\n\n%TEMP%\\winopen.exewinopen.exe\n\n### Registrant Email:\n\n\n-----\n\ncryptofinancial[@]yandex[.]com\n\n\n-----",
