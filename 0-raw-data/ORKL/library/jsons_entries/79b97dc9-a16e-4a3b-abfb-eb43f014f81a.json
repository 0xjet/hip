In early 2015,\n\n#### T\n\nwe came across stealthy malware—which we\ncall HAMMERTOSS—from an advanced\npersistent threat group that we suspect the\nRussian government sponsors. We designate\nthis group APT29.\n\nUsing a variety of techniques—from creating an\nalgorithim that generates daily Twitter handles\nto embedding pictures with commands—the\ndevelopers behind HAMMERTOSS have devised\na particularly effective tool. APT29 tries to\nundermine the detection of the malware by\nadding layers of obfuscation and mimicking\n\n\nthe behavior of legitimate users. HAMMERTOSS\nuses Twitter, GitHub, and cloud storage services\nto relay commands and extract data from\ncompromised networks.\n\n###### Using a variety of techniques—from creating algorithms that generate daily Twitter handles to embedding pictures with commands—the developers behind HAMMERTOSS have devised a particularly effective tool. \n\n\n-----\n\n###### HAMMERTOSS works by:\n\n\nWhile none of these tactics are new, the combination of these\ntechniques piqued our interest.\n\n\n-----\n\n# APT29KALININGRAD\nTIME\n MOSCOW\nTIME\n SAMARA\nTIME YEKATERINBURG TIME\n OMSK\nTIME\n KRASNOYARSK TIME\n IRKUTSK\nTIME\n\n|KALININGRAD TIME|MOSCOW TIME|SAMARA TIME|YEKATERINBURG TIME|OMSK TIME|KRASNOYARSK TIME|IRKUTSK TIME|YAKUTSK TIME|VLADIVOSTOK TIME|SREDNEKOLYMSK TIME|KAMCHATKA TIME|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n||||||||||||\n||||||||||||\n|(UTC + 02/MSK-1)|(UTC + 03/MSK)|(UTC + 04/MSK+1)|(UTC + 05/MSK+2)|(UTC + 06/MSK+3)|(UTC + 07/MSK+4)|(UTC + 08/MSK+5)|(UTC + 09/MSK+6)|(UTC + 10/MSK+7)|(UTC + 11/MSK+8)|(UTC + 12/MSK+9)|\n\n\nAPT29 has been operating in its current form\nsince at least late 2014. We suspect the Russian\ngovernment sponsors the group because of\nthe organizations it targets and the data it\nsteals.  Additionally, APT29 appeared to cease\noperations on Russian holidays, and their work\nhours seem to to align with the UTC +3 time\nzone, which contains cities such as Moscow\nand St. Petersburg.\n\nWhile other APT groups try to cover their\ntracks to thwart investigators, very few groups\nshow the same discipline and consistency.\n\n\nSimilarly, few groups display the ability to adapt\nto network defenders’ attempts to mitigate its\nactivity or remove it from victim networks. For\nexample, APT29 almost always uses anti-forensic\ntechniques, and they monitor victim remediation\nefforts to subvert them. Likewise, the group\nappears to almost solely uses compromised\nservers for CnC to enhance the security of its\noperations and maintains a rapid development\ncycle for its malware by quickly modifying tools to\nundermine detection. These aspects make APT29\none of the most capable APT groups that we track.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### INTRODUCING HAMMERTOSS\n\n\ne first identified\nHAMMERTOSS in early\n2015. APT29 likely used\n\n#### W\n\nHAMMERTOSS as a backup for their two\nprimary backdoors to execute commands\nand maintain access if the group’s principal\ntools were discovered. We have identified\ntwo HAMMERTOSS variants that give\nAPT29 alternative ways to communicate\nwith the malware. The developer appears\nto name these variants uploader and\n_tDiscoverer.[1] Both variants are written_\nin the C# programming language. Each\n\n\nvariant uses different methods to acquire\nCnC instructions, either by directly\naccessing a hard-coded website or\naccessing Twitter as an intermediary.\n\n- _Uploader is preconfigured to use a_\n\nhard-coded server for its CnC. It goes\nto a specific URL to obtain an image\nwith a specific file size.\n\n- _tDiscoverer uses an additional layer of_\n\nobfuscation by first going to Twitter to\nobtain a CnC URL, before visiting the\nURL to acquire its target image.\n\n\nWe will focus on tDiscoverer in this report.\n\n###### Five Stages of HAMMERTOSS\nWe have broken down the malware\ncommunication process into five stages\nto explain how the tool operates,\nreceives instructions, and extracts\ninformation from victim networks. The\nstages include information on what\nAPT29 does outside of the compromised\nnetwork to communicate with\nHAMMERTOSS and a brief assessment\nof the tool’s ability to mask its activity.\n\n\n**2** TWEETS1\n**1**\n\n**bobby** **Tweets** Tweet & replies\n@1abBob52b **bobby Follow @1abBob52b  doctorhandbook.com #101docto[•] July 29**\n\n2. HAMMERTOSS visits the\nassociated Twitter account\nand looks for a tweet with\na URL and a hashtag that\nindicates the location and\nminimum size of an image file.\n\n**3**\n\n3. HAMMERTOSS visits\nthe URL and obtains an\n\n**4** image.\n\n4. The image looks normal,\nbut actually contains hidden\nand encrypted data using **010111101101\n111011011110** **Note: The images are**\nsteganography. **010111101\n10 010111101** stock photography and were not used by the\n\nHAMMERTOSS decrypts the\n\ngroup.\n\nhidden data to obtain commands.\n\n\nTWEETS\n\n\n-----\n\n###### STAGE 1:\n The Communication Process Begins with Twitter\n\n\nTWEETS\n\n\n**Figure 1: HAMMERTOSS calls out to a Twitter handle**\n\n|3a.

APT29’s operator does not register the handle. HAMMERTOSS waits until the next day to begin the process again.||\n\n\nAMMERTOSS first looks for\ninstructions on Twitter.\n\nThe malware contains an\n\n### H\n\nalgorithm that generates a daily Twitter\nhandle, which is an account user ID.\nTo create the handles, the algorithm\nemploys a basename, such as “Bob,” and\nappends and prepends three CRC32\nvalues based on the date. For example,\n“1abBob52b” would have the URL:\nhxxps://twitter.com/1abBob52b. Each\nHAMMERTOSS sample will create a\ndifferent Twitter handle each day.\n\n\nAPT29 knows the algorithm used to\ngenerate the handles and chooses\nto register a Twitter handle and post\nobfuscated instructions to the handle’s\nURL before the malware attempts to\nquery it. If a particular day’s handle\nis not registered and the URL for that\nday is not found, HAMMERTOSS will\nwait until the next day to attempt to\ncommunicate with another handle.\n\n\nAPT29 typically configures\nHAMMERTOSS to communicate\nwithin certain restrictions, such as\nonly checking the Twitter handle on\nweekdays or after a specified start date.\nThis allows the malware to blend in to\n“normal” traffic during the victim’s work\nweek or to remain dormant for a period\nof time before activating.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### STAGE 2:\n Tweeting a URL, Minimum File Size of an Image,\n and Part of an Encryption Key\n\nIf APT29’s operator has registered that\nparticular day’s handle, he will tweet a URL\nand hashtag.\n\nTWEETS\n\n###### 1\n\n bobby Tweets Tweet & replies @1abBob52b\n\n**bobby @1abBob52b  [•] July 29**\nFollow doctorhandbook.com #101docto\n\nURL: In the case above,\nthe tweet instructs\nHAMMERTOSS to download\nthe content hosted at the\nspecified URL, including any f APT29 has registered that day’s Twitter handle,\nimages on the page.

Many of these are\nunregistered, as APT29 chooses\nto register a particular day’s\nhandle as needed and ahead of\nan anticipated HAMMERTOSS\nbeacon. This small number of\nregistered accounts allows\nthe group to maintain a small\nfootprint.\n\nOther tools use Twitter to relay\ninstructions, including:[2]\n\n - MiniDuke, a Windows-based\n\nbackdoor that is a suspected\nRussian tool\n\n - the Sninfs botnet\n\n - Flashback, a Mac-based\n\nbackdoor\n\nMiniDuke behaves similarly\nto HAMMERTOSS by not only\nusing Twitter for CnC, but also\nby downloading image files\ncontaining encrypted, appended\ncontent.\n\n\n2“Miniduke still duking it out.” ESET Security. 20 May 2014. http://www.welivesecurity.com/2014/05/20/miniduke-still-duking/ Balazs, Biro, Christian Istrate, and Mairus Tivaradar.

We have observed URLs lead to specific GitHub\n\n#### H\n\naccounts or compromised websites.\n\nWe will use Github for the next part in our example. Once\nHAMMERTOSS obtains the GitHub URL from its daily Twitter\naccount, it visits the URL and downloads the contents of the\npage, including any image files.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### STAGE 4:\n APT29 Employs Basic Steganography\n\n1. HAMMERTOSS\ndownloads the image\nfrom the specified URL,\nretrieves the image **1**\nfrom Internet Explorer’s\nbrowser cache, and\nbegins the process of\ndecryption.\n\nAMMERTOSS downloads the\ncontents of the website to\nInternet Explorer’s browser cache\n\n#### H\n\nand searches the cache for any images **010111101101\n111011011110\n 3**\n\n**010111101**\n\nat least as large as the offset specified in **10 010111101**\nthe tweet from Stage 2.\n\nWhile the image appears normal,\nit actually contains steganographic\ndata. Steganography is the practice of\nconcealing a message, image, or file\nwithin another message, image, or file. In\nthis case, the image contains appended\nand encrypted data that HAMMERTOSS\nwill decrypt and execute. The data may\ninclude commands or login credentials to\n\n3. HAMMERTOSS decrypts the image using a hard-coded key\n\nupload a victim’s data to a cloud storage appended with the characters obtained from the tweet in Stage 2.\nservice. HAMMERTOSS locates the\nencrypted data at the offset specified in\nthe tweet in Stage 2. It decrypts the data End of File Marker\nusing a key comprised of hard-coded\ndata from the malware binary appended\nwith the characters from the tweet.\n\n\n**010111101101\n 3**\n**111011011110**\n**010111101**\n**10 010111101**\n\n\n**Figure 5: Encrypted data appended beyond**\nthe FF D9 JPEG End of File marker\n\n\n###### End of File Marker\n\n\n###### APT29 ADDING STEGANOGRAPHY\n AS ANOTHER LAYER OF OBFUSCATION\n\n\nWe have observed only a few\nAPT groups using steganography.\nHAMMERTOSS uses\nsteganography by appending\ndata to an image file after the\nimage’s end of file marker. This\ntechnique would be readily\ndetectable if someone was\nchecking for it. However, the\n\n\nappended data is encrypted, so\neven if detected, the investigator\nwould be unable to decrypt the\ndata without key material from\ntwo sources: the malware binary\nand the current tweet.\n\nIndicative of APT29’s discipline,\nthe group ensures that if\nnetwork defenders discover\n\n\nthe images, the defenders still\nrequire the malware sample,\ncorresponding Twitter handle,\nand tweet with the additional\nkey material to decrypt the tool’s\ninstructions. All of the samples\nwe have observed have used\ndifferent encryption keys to\ndecrypt the appended content.\n\n\n**Figure 5:**\nthe FF D9\n\n###### APT29 ADDING\n OF OBFUSCATION\n\n\n-----\n\n###### STAGE 5:\n Executing Commands and Uploading Victim Data\n\n|Col1|APT29’s operator creates the cloud storage account and can obtain the victim’s data from the cloud storage service.|\n|---|---|\n|||\n\n\n**1**\n\n\n**Figure 6: Executing Commands and Removing Data**\n\n\n**1**\n\n**2**\n\n2. HAMMERTOSS is capable of uploading victim\ndata to a cloud storage service.\n\n\nhe encrypted data in the image may include\ninstructions to execute commands via\nPowerShell, execute a direct command or\n\n#### T\n\nfile, or save an executable to disk and execute it.\n\nIn several cases, the commands directed\nHAMMERTOSS to upload information from\nvictim networks to accounts on cloud storage\nservices using login credentials received in\n\n\nStage 4. In our GitHub example, the decrypted\ndata instructed the backdoor to obtain a list of\nrunning tasks—reconnaissance on the victim\nnetwork—and upload it to a specific account on a\ncloud storage service using the login credentials.\nAPT29 can then easily obtain the extracted\ninformation from the cloud storage service at\ntheir convenience.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CONCLUSION\n Difficulty Identifying Accounts, Discerning Legitimate and Malicious Traffic, and Locating the Payload\n\n\nAMMERTOSS undermines network\ndefenders’ ability to identify Twitter\naccounts used for CnC, discern malicious\n\n#### H\n\nnetwork traffic from legitimate activity, and\nlocate the malicious payloads downloaded by\nthe malware.\n\n - Identifying daily potential Twitter accounts\n\nrequires network defenders to have access to\nthe associated HAMMERTOSS binary and to\nreverse engineer it to identify the basename\nand the algorithm used to create the potential\naccounts. Monitoring malicious tweets from\nthese accounts is difficult as each sample is\ncapable of generating hundreds of potential\nTwitter accounts annually, and APT29 may\nonly register a small number of those accounts\nfor CnC.\n\n - Employing legitimate web services that are\n\nwidely allowed in organizations’ networks—\nsome of which use Secure Sockets Layer\nconnections that ensure the communications\nare encrypted—makes it harder for network\ndefenders to discern between malicious and\nlegitimate traffic.\n\n - Using steganography and varying the image size\n\nmakes the target payload—the image containing\nthe appended, encoded commands—less\npredictable. Even if the network defenders are\nable to predict or identify the target payloads,\nthey need the associated HAMMERTOSS\nsample and relevant tweet containing the\nrelated encryption key information to decrypt\nthe contents.\n\n\n###### APT29: AN ADAPTIVE AND DISCIPLINED THREAT GROUP\nHAMMERTOSS illustrates APT29’s ability to adapt\nquickly during operations to avoid detection and\nremoval. For example, if an organization blocks\naccess to GitHub, APT29 could easily redirect\nHAMMERTOSS to download an image with\nencrypted instructions from another website.\nSimilarly, if an organization starts monitoring\nTwitter activity on their network, APT29 could\neasily switch to using the Uploader variant of\nHAMMERTOSS, which does not use Twitter and\ncommunicates directly to a specified URL. If an\norganization identifies the handle generation\nalgorithm and attempts to research old Twitter\naccounts, tweets, or secondary URLs, APT29\ncould easily delete previously used accounts or the\nlocations where images were stored.\n\nWhile each technique in HAMMERTOSS is not\nnew, APT29 has combined them into a single piece\nof malware. Individually, each technique offers\nsome degree of obfuscation for the threat group’s\nactivity. In combination, these techniques make it\nparticularly hard to identify HAMMERTOSS or spot\nmalicious network traffic; determine the nature\nand purpose of the binary; discern the malware’s\nCnC method and predict its CnC accounts; capture\nand decode second-stage CnC information; and\npinpoint and decrypt the image files containing\nmalware commands. This makes HAMMERTOSS\na powerful backdoor at the disposal of one of the\nmost capable threat groups we have observed.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### To download this or other\n\n FireEye Threat Intelligence reports,\n\n visit: https://www.fireeye.com/reports.html\n\n\n[FireEye, Inc. | 1440 McCarthy Blvd. Milpitas, CA 95035 | 408.321.6300 | 877.FIREEYE (347.3393) | info@fireeye.com | www.fireeye.com](mailto:info%40FireEye.com)\n\n© 2015 FireEye, Inc.
