First\n[discovered by SenseCy on darkweb forums and later by Michael Gillespie through his ID-](https://twitter.com/SenseCyBlog/status/778866702410915840)\nRansomware platform, Princess Locker encrypts a victim's data and then demands a hefty\nransom amount of 3 bitcoins, or approximately $1,800 USD, to purchase a decryptor. If\npayment is not made in the specified timeframe, then the ransom payment doubles to 6\nbitcoins\n\nNot much is known about Princess Locker other than having seen a few encrypted files and\n[ransom notes uploaded to ID-Ransomware. From what has been gather gathered, when a](https://id-ransomware.malwarehunterteam.com/)\nperson is infected, the ransomware will encrypt the victim's files and then append a random\nextension to encrypted files and a unique ID is created for the victim. This ID, extension, and\nencryption is then most likely sent up to the ransomware's Command & Control server.\n\n\n-----\n\nRansom notes are also created and displayed, which are named\n**!_HOW_TO_RESTORE_[extension].TXT**\nand !_HOW_TO_RESTORE_[extension].html.\n\nThese ransom notes contain the victim's ID and links to the TOR payment sites where a\nvictim can login to see payment information.\n\n## The Princess Locker Payment Site\n\nThe Princess Locker payment site is your standard ransomware site with no special\nfeatures. When victim's access the Princess Locker payment site they will be greeted with a\n[page asking them to select a language that looks almost identical to Cerber's language](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-cerber-ransomware-not-only-encrypts-your-data-but-also-speaks-to-you/)\nselection page.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Language Selection Screen**\n\nThey will then be presented with a login prompt where they need to enter the victim ID\nprovided in the ransom note. Once logged in they will see the main payment site, which\ncontains information such as the ransom amount, the bitcoin address to send payment to,\nand the answers to common questions.\n\nThe payment site also provides the ability to decrypt 1 file free. Unfortunately, since we do\nnot have a sample of the ransomware, and I didn't want to waste a victim's free decryption, I\ndo not know if this feature works or not.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Princess Locker Payment Site**\n\n**Free File Decryption**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe one item that is missing from the payment site is a support page that victim s can use to\ncontact the malware developers. If this ransomware goes into wider distribution, I would not\nbe surprised to see one added.\n\nWe are still actively looking for a sample of this ransomware, so if one is encountered, please\n[upload it here.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/submit-malware.php?channel=168)\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Indian airline SpiceJet's flights impacted by ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/indian-airline-spicejets-flights-impacted-by-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[US Senate: Govt’s ransomware fight hindered by limited reporting](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-senate-govt-s-ransomware-fight-hindered-by-limited-reporting/)\n\n[New RansomHouse group sets up extortion market, adds first victims](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-ransomhouse-group-sets-up-extortion-market-adds-first-victims/)\n\n[Ransomware attack exposes data of 500,000 Chicago students](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-attack-exposes-data-of-500-000-chicago-students/)\n\n[The Week in Ransomware - May 20th 2022 - Another one bites the dust](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-week-in-ransomware-may-20th-2022-another-one-bites-the-dust/)\n\n[Princess Locker](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/princess-locker/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
