White\n Hammer was expelled in March 2014,[[13]] and in\n\n the following months Patriot left the organization\n along with many UNA-UNSO members.[[14]]\n\n In June 2014 one of the groups was assigned by\n\n the Interior Ministry to surveil Mariupol after it\n\n captured the city from Russian-backed\n insurgents.[[15][16]]\n\n Right Sector's political ideology has been\n characterized as nationalist,[[17][18]]\n ultranationalist,[[19][20]] neofascist,[[21]] right-wing,[[22]]\n or far right.[[23][24][25][26]] Right Sector was the\n\n second-most mentioned political group in Russian\n\n media during the first half of 2014; Russian state�\n TV depicted it as neo-Nazi.[[27][28]] The Associated\n\n Press found no evidence that the group had\n committed hate crimes.[[20]] In the 2014 Ukrainian\n\n parliamentary election Yarosh as a Right Sector\n\n candidate won a parliament seat by winning a\n single-member district with 29.8% of the votes.[[29]]\n\n Right Sector spokesperson Boryslav Bereza as\n\n\n#### Right Sector\n**Правий сектор**\n\n**Slogan** **God!

The name is derived from the group's effort to protect the right\n side of the Euromaidan protestors at one point during the protests.[[35]]\n\n## History [ edit ]\n\n### Origins [ edit ]\n\n#### Right Sector formed in late November 2013 as a\n\n confederation of streetfighting soccer fans and right-�\n\n wing nationalist groups: Patriot of Ukraine (Andriy\n\n Belitsky), the Social-National Assembly, Trident\n\n (Dmytro Yarosh), UNA–UNSO (Yuriy Shukhevych),\n White Hammer, and Carpathian Sich.[[11][12][36][37][38]]\n\n The BBC reports that Right Sector's Kiev organization\n\n is primarily formed by Russian-speaking soccer fans\n\n\n#### who share nationalist views.[[39][40][41]]\n\n The organization views itself within the tradition of\n\n Uk i i ti h th Uk i i I t\n\n\n**Dmytro Yarosh, Tryzub's leader and**\n**the former leader of Right Sector.**\n\n\n-----\n\n#### the Axis.

He was then offered the position of\n\n deputy head of the National Security Council but\n rejected it as being beneath him.[[51]]\n\n In February 2014, Yarosh and the Israeli ambassador\n\n to Ukraine agreed to establish a \"hotline\" to prevent\n\n\n#### provocations and coordinate actions when issues\n arise.[[52][53]] The group assists in the protection of\n Jewish sites in Odessa.[[54]]\n\n Russia has cited attacks by Right Sector on Russian\n\n\n**Activists in Odessa holding Right**\n**Sector banner with ship-anchor design,**\n**9 February 2014**\n\n\n#### speakers and Jews as the main reason it sent troops into Crimea.[[20]]\n\n On 7 March 2014, Tarasenko told Interfax-Ukraine that the \"informal movement\" would be\n transforming itself into a political party at a congress on 15 March.[[55]][[][need quotation to verify][]]\n\n On 11 March 2014, Russian Duma opposition leader Valery Rashkin called on Russian special\n\n services to \"liquidate\" Yarosh and Right Sector's leader for West Ukraine, UNA–UNSO member\n Oleksandr Muzychko.[[56]] He said that Muzychko had fought for Chechen separatists against\n\n Russian troops and been charged with banditry.

Others said that they later heard two shots fired near the cafe.�[57] Ukraine's Interior\n\n Ministry stated that he was shot after opening fire on police and Sokil special forces.

Yarosh denied his organization's involvement and claimed that he could not\n have given orders to picket \"the man who helped Euromaidan\".[[76]][[][need quotation to verify][]]\n\n On 15 October 2014 around 125 masked men with Right Sector insignia blocked the company\n\n Zaporizhstal; Right Sector denied involvement in this blockade and labelled it as an attempt to\n discredit the organization.[[77]]\n\n In the 26 October 2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election Yarosh as a Right Sector candidate\n\n won a parliament seat by winning single-member district number 39 located in Vasylkivka Raion\n with 29 76% of the votes [[29]] The party had competed in 35 districts [[78]] Yarosh did not join a\n\n\n-----\n\n#### district in Kiev with 29.44% of the votes.[[6]] Bereza also did not join a faction.

Two people were killed. According to President\n\n Poroshenko's parliamentary faction leader Yuriy Lutsenko, these events \"result[ed from] the\n\n conflict of interests between illegal armed groups and a mafia overtly cooperating with law�\n enforcers.\" [[81]] Some local leaders indicated the conflict ensued when Right Sector forces�\n\n attempted to clamp down on the lucrative illegal cigarette smuggling trade to Western Europe,\n\n in which local law enforcement have been complicit. Immediate fallout from the events included\n\n the sacking of the leadership of the local Zakarpatya district customs service. Ukrainian MP\n Mykhailo Lanyo, fingered in the smuggling ring, reportedly fled Ukraine.�[[82]] Right Sector leader\n\n Yarosh called for calm, and denied that Right Sector troops were being withdrawn from eastern\n Ukraine.[[83][84][85][86]]\n\n### Contemporary situation [ edit ]\n\n#### Yarosh resigned as Right Sector leader on 11 November 2015. [[31]] Late December 2015 he\n announced that he was forming a new political party that would start in February 2016.[[87]]\n\n## Paramilitary operations [ edit ]\n\n#### Right Sector seized military weaponry from an\n\n Interior Ministry arsenal in western Ukraine, near\n\n Lviv, towards the end of the Maidan revolution. Right\n\n Sector delivered some weapons to Ukrainian\n\n authorities in the aftermath of the revolution, and\n kept others.[[88]]\n\n Following the collapse of the Yanukovych\n\n\n#### government, with police having largely abandoned\n\n the streets of Kiev, groups of young men, including\n\n members of Right Sector, patrolled them armed\n\n mostly with baseball bats and sometimes with\n guns.[[47]]\n\n\n**Yarosh (right) meets Donbas Battalion**\n**commander Semen Semenchenko, 12 July**\n**2014**\n\n\n#### According to Yarosh, Right Sector has recruited retired officers of the interior ministry and the�\n\n security agencies. He told Newsweek that \"as in any army\" it has specialists who are trained to\n use S-300 antiaircraft missiles.[[10]]\n\n### Ukrainian Volunteer Corps [ edit ]\n\n#### Right Sector has its own volunteer battalion that is fighting in the �War in Donbass.[[89]] It was\n formed late April 2014.[[68]] On 19 July 2014 Right Sector said it was ready to contribute 5,000\n people to fight, if the military provided suitable combat equipment.�[[90]]\n\n Right Sector lost twelve fighters when ambushed outside �Donetsk in August 2014. Yarosh, the\n group's leader, vowed his group would avenge the deaths.[[91]] On 17 August 2014 Right Sector\n\n accused the Interior Ministry of harbouring counterrevolutionary forces seeking to destroy the\n Ukrainian volunteer movement.[[92]] It said that Deputy Interior Minister Vladimir Yevdokimov's\n\n followers among the police had illegally searched or detained dozens of Right Sector volunteers\n and confiscated weapons they had taken in combat.�[[93]] Interior Minister Arsen Avakov replied,\n\n saying that he had already submitted a request to President Poroshenko that Yevdokimov be\n dismissed.[[94]]\n\n\n-----\n\n**Fighters of the Ukrainian Volunteer Corps (DUK)**\n\n\n#### Right Sector's military unit includes about fifty citizens of Russia and Belarus.�[[95]] Members\n\n come from all parts of Ukraine, including the Donbass and Crimea; Russia; other former Soviet\n\n republics; and Western countries.\n\n Ideologically, Volunteer Corps members' political views range from the far right to liberalism to\n\n the far left, including anarchists. Members are Christians, Muslims, Buddhists, Jews, pagans\n and atheists, and include both men and women of all ages.[[96]]\n\n In December 2015, group leader Dmytro Yarosh announced that the 5th and 8th battalions, and\n\n the medical battalion, would be incorporated into the Armed Forces of Ukraine following his\n departure from Right Sector.[[97]] The UVC, if possible, would become part of the National Guard\n\n of Ukraine and will in the near future report to the Ministry of Internal Affairs or would be merged\n\n as part of the Ukrainian Ground Forces.\n\n## Ideology [ edit ]\n\n### Description by the party [ edit ]\n\n#### The party's ideology is based on the Ukrainian national idea.[[1]] The party believes that idea of a\n\n nation is more broad than the concept of people as ethnos, yet nothing even close to the\n cosmopolitan concept of \"political nation\".[[1]] Nation is a conscious and effective unity of people\n united around the idea of freedom that is based on ethno-social and spiritually cultural factors.[[1]]\n\n Ukrainian nationalism is\n\n An ideology of national freedom, freedom of people\n and person[[1]]\n An idea and cause in the name of Ukraine[[1]]\n\n An ideology of defense, preservation, and state\n assertion of the Ukrainian nation[[1]]\n A philosophy of national existence [[1]]\n\n\n**March in Kiev on anniversary of the**\n\n\n-----\n\n#### based on protection, development, and revival of the\n nation based on national imperative or absolute order.[[1]]\n\n According to its literature, an idealistic worldview is intrinsic to Ukrainian nationalism. [[1]]\n\n### Descriptions in scholarly work [ edit ]\n\n#### Scholars Andreas Umland and Anton Shekhovstov have written that Right Sector formed as a\n\n loose collection of small groups, outside parliament, that were ultraconservative and included a\n neo-Nazi fringe.[[37]] According to researcher Alina Polyakova, one of Right Sector's constituent\n\n groups, Tryzub, is composed of radical, right-wing nationalists. She writes that the Patriots of\n\n Ukraine, another constituent group, has organized attacks against foreigners or international\n\n students, and is connected to neo-fascist ideology and symbolism; scholar Volodymyr\n Ishchenko describes the group as neo-Nazi.[[98]] Polyakova describes the ideology of the UNA UNSO as nationalist, and sometimes including aspects of anarchism.[[][citation needed][]]\n\n Shekhovstov has written that Patriot of Ukraine and Social National Assembly, which are racist\n\n and engage in real or symbolic violence against minorities, also oppose alcohol and drug\n use.[[99]] (Also) according to Shekhovtsov \"The main peculiarity of the Ukrainian far right is that\n\n its main enemy is not immigrants or national minorities, as often happens with the EU-based far\n right, but the Kremlin\".[[100]]\n\n### Descriptions in the press [ edit ]\n\n#### Right Sector has been described by BBC News as a \"Ukrainian nationalist group\" [[19]] and an\n \"umbrella organization of far-right groups\".[[101]] Time has described it as a \"radical right-wing\n group ... a coalition of militant ultra-nationalists\",[[23]] with an ideology that \"borders on fascism\".[[8]]\n\n The New York Times has described it as a \"nationalist group\" and a \"coalition of once-fringe\n Ukrainian nationalist groups\".[[18]]\n\n The Guardian has identified it as a \"nationalist Ukrainian group\";�[[102]] Reuters as a \"far-right\n nationalist group\";[[103]] Agence France Presse as a \"far-right\" group; [[26]] and the Wall Street\n Journal as an \"umbrella group for far-right activists and ultranationalists\". [[104]]\n\n Die Welt, the New York Times, and Le Monde Diplomatique have described some of Right\n\n Sector's constituent groups as radical right-wing, neofascist, or neo-Nazi, but also that is\n distanced itself from antisemism.[[21][36][39]]\n\n Writing for Foreign Policy, Hannah Kozlowska stated that Russian propaganda tried to\n\n demonize the Ukraine government and build a case for the annexation of Crimea by depicting\n\n Right Sector as a powerful neo-Nazi force bent on taking over the government. During the first�\n\n half of 2014, Right Sector was the second-most mentioned political group in online Russian\n mass media.[[27]]\n\n The Associated Press has called it a \"radical ultranationalist group ... demonized by Russian\n state propaganda as fascists\".[[20]] The AP reported that it had found no evidence of hate crimes\n by the group.[[20]]\n\n The Russian News & Information Agency has portrayed Right Sector as a \"radical far right\n\n opposition group\" and said that \"Russian state media have tried to cast the demonstrations as a\n predominantly Fascism-inspired movement\".[[24]]\n\n The RT (formerly Russia Today) TV News network has portrayed it as a \"Ukrainian radical neo fascist\" group.[[67]]\n\n### Other Ukrainians and political parties [ edit ]\n\n#### In an interview, Yarosh stated that Right Sector and Svoboda \"have a lot of common positions\n\n\n-----\n\n#### stating: We are enemies to those saying that there [is] no Ukraine, or Ukrainians, or …\n Ukrainian language.\"[[106]]\n\n According to journalist Oleg Shynkarenko, Yarosh has indicated that Right Sector opposes\n homosexuality and has also implied that the right of the nation trumps human rights.[[12]] The\n\n New York Times has written that \"Right Sector, a coalition of ultranationalist and in some cases\n\n neo-Nazi organizations,\" has attempted to distance itself from anti-Semitism, citing Yarosh's\n pledge to fight �racism in Ukraine.[[36]] According to Spiegel Online, Dmytro Yarosh has stated that\n\n anti-semitism is not a part of Right Sector's ideology.\n\n Tarasenko has stated that the group has no \"phobias\", that it respects every other nation, and\n that it supports the nation state model.[[106]]\n\n Some Ukrainians in southern and eastern Ukraine view Right Sector negatively and accuse its\n members of carrying out a war against the regions on behalf of the government in Kiev.[[107]] The\n\n group took part in demonstrations in support of Israel in the city of Dnipropetrovsk on 28 July\n\n 2014, saying, \"We, like Israel, learn unity; learn to love and defend their country, at war with the\n most heinous and vile enemy - terrorism.\"[[108]]\n\n### Attitude towards Europe [ edit ]\n\n#### Right Sector's website says that its members distrust the \"imperial ambitions\" of both Russia\n and the West.[[109]] Yarosh told Spiegel Online that anti-Christian organizations are in active\n\n operation in the EU and that the European Commission (rather than the member nation) has\n control of lifestyles such as gay marriage.[[110]] He does not see Europe or NATO as a potential\n partner and believes that they are part of a coalition against Ukraine.[[110]]\n\n Right Sector is the only Ukrainian activist group that opposes joining the European Union. It\n regards the EU as an \"oppressor\" of European nations.[[40]]\n\n### Domestic policy [ edit ]\n\n#### Right Sector has the position that the population should keep and bear arms, as in\n Switzerland.[[106]] Yarosh told the New York Times that the organization's lawyers were drafting a\n bill modeled on Swiss notions of firearms possession.�[88]\n\n### Moral issues [ edit ]\n\n#### According to historian and political scientist Andreas Umland Right Sector is ultra-Christian\n conservative and radical nationalist.[[3]]\n\n On 2 June 2015 the party sent an open letter to Kiev Mayor Vitali Klitschko asking him to cancel\n a pride parade to be held two days later citing \"danger of provocations\". [[111]] The letter also\n\n quoted Major Archbishop of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church Sviatoslav Shevchuk stating\n \"Ukraine rejects the false values as gender ideology\".[[112]] The letter also claimed Europeans still\n\n have an ambiguous attitude about \"LGBT\" stating \"in Poland abortion is banned in general, not\n to mention same-sex marriages\".[[112]] In a Facebook post Right Sector leader Yarosh claimed\n\n the gay pride parade “spit on the graves of those who died and defended Ukraine”; and he\n\n promised that the group’s members will “put aside other business in order to prevent those who\n\n hate family, morality, and human nature, from executing their plans.

It\n states that its main goal is to create a Ukrainian united independent state.[[][citation needed][]]\n\n According to Tryzub, its enemies in achieving this goal are ″imperialism and chauvinism,\n\n fascism and communism, cosmopolitanism and pseudo-nationalism, totalitarianism and anarchy,\n any evil that seeks to parasitize on the sweat and blood of Ukrainians″.[[121]]\n\n### Ukrainian National Assembly – Ukrainian National Self-Defense [ edit ]\n\n#### Main article: Ukrainian National Assembly – Ukrainian People's Self-Defence\n\n The Ukrainian National Assembly – Ukrainian National\n\n Self-Defense (UNA–UNSO) is a Ukrainian political\n\n organization perceived as far-right in Ukraine and\n abroad.[[122][123]][[][needs update][]] The faction supplied a\n\n volunteer battalion that in 1993 participated in the War\n\n in Abkhazia, which was depicted in a documentary film�\n\n \"Shadows of War\" by Georgiy Gongadze.

However, these battalions were legal parts of\n\n various Ukrainian security agencies, most of them serving\n\n under the Ministry of Defense or the Ministry of Interior.\n\n Their volunteers were required to follow orders of the\n\n commanders appointed to these agencies. In May 2014\n\n the group became registered as a social organization\n under Ukrainian law.[[124][125]]\n\n The status of the Volunteer Ukrainian Corps is not official.�\n\n## References [ edit ]\n\n**1. ^ [a]** **_[b]_** **_[c]_** **_[d]_** **_[e]_** **_[f]_** **_[g]_** **_[h]_** **_[i]_** **_[j]_** **_[k]_** **Ideology of Tryzub and Right**\n\n**Sector** **Right Sector website**\n\n\n**UNA-UNSO members in Kiev,**\n**January 26, 2014**\n\n\n**Volunteer Ukrainian Corps**\n**(DUK), a paramilitary wing of the**\n**Right Sector, among the Donetsk**\n**airport defenders**\n\n\n-----\n\n**3. ^  http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/equal-**\n\n**[rights-for-gays-still-distant-dream-in-ukraine-](http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/equal-rights-for-gays-still-distant-dream-in-ukraine-390865.html)**\n\n**390865.html** **, Kyiv Post (11 June 2015)**\n\n**4.** **^** **(Ukrainian)** **[Elected People's Deputies of Ukraine](http://web.archive.org/web/20150125143242/http://www.cvk.gov.ua/pls/vnd2014/wp611?PT001F01=910)** **.**\n\n**Central Election Commission of Ukraine**\n\n**5.** **^** **[Кандидати, яких обрано депутатами рад](http://www.cvk.gov.ua/wvm2015/pvm002pt001f01=100pt00_t001f01=100.html)** **.**\n\n**_www.cvk.gov.ua (in Ukrainian). 15 November 2015._**\n\n**Retrieved 15 November 2015.**\n\n**6. ^ [a]** **_[b]_** **_[c]_** **(Ukrainian)** **Candidates and winner for the seat in**\n\n**[constituency 213 in the 2014 Ukrainian parliamentary](http://vibori2014.rbc.ua/ukr/okrug/volynskaya-oblast/odnomandatny-213)**\n\n**election** **, RBK Ukraine**\n\n**(Ukrainian)** **[Boryslav Bereza very short bio](http://vibori2014.rbc.ua/ukr/person/bereza-borislav-efimovich)** **, RBK**\n\n**Ukraine**\n\n**Video of first brawl in Verkhovna Rada becomes a�**\n\n**YouTube hit** **, Kyiv Post (5 December 2014)**\n\n**7.** **^ Shuster, Simon (21 February 2014).** **\"Ukraine**\n\n**parliament’s deal leads to an uneasy peace\"** **.
