The](https://tria.ge/220916-nvj7wafff5)\nISO file contained a lure document, written in Ukrainian, that\nmasquerades as a request for discounts on fuel for citizens of the\nOleksandrivka Raion (district), an area in Donetsk. Additionally,\nthe ISO file delivers an executable that deploys both Colibri\nLoader and Warzone RAT to the target machine.\n\nColibri Loader, first reported by Insikt Group in August\n2021, is a commodity malware leased on XSS Forum by the user\n“c0d3r_0f_shr0d13ng3r”. It is written in assembly and C to target\nWindows operating systems without any dependencies. On March\n11, 2022, Cloudsek researchers [described Colibri Loader as “a](https://cloudsek.com/in-depth-technical-analysis-of-colibri-loader-malware/)\ntype of malware that is used to load more types of malware into\nthe infected system” which has “multiple techniques that help\navoid detection”. On April 5, 2022, Malwarebytes researchers\n[also reported on the operations of the Colibri Loader and further](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-intelligence/2022/04/colibri-loader-combines-task-scheduler-and-powershell-in-clever-persistence-technique/)\ndetailed its functionality, including its ability to “deliver and\nmanage payloads onto infected computers”.\n\nWarzone RAT (also known as Ave Maria Stealer) is a popular\ncommodity remote access tool (RAT) that has been in active\ndevelopment since 2018. It is sold on underground forums\nand on the developer’s website, warzone[.]ws. The malware is\nadvertised as a full-featured RAT developed in C/C++ that claims\nto be “easy to use and highly reliable.”\n\n\n##### Threat and Technical Analysis\n\nInsikt Group used intelligence provided by CERT-UA to\ndiscover further infrastructure linked to UAC-0113. The information\nuncovered suggests that it is highly likely that this threat group\nis continuing to masquerade as telecommunication providers\noperating within Ukraine. While monitoring the infrastructure,\nInsikt Group observed a malicious ISO file embedded in the\nHTML code, suggesting that domains and related IP addresses\nhave likely already been, or are soon to become, operationalized.\n\n###### Infrastructure\n\nA domain noted in CERT-UA’s June [report on UAC-0113,](https://cert.gov.ua/article/405538)\ndatagroup[.]ddns[.]net, was likely masquerading as the Ukrainian\ntelecommunications company Datagroup.

The domain ett[.]ddns[.]net is\nlikely a spoof of the legitimate domain for EuroTransTelecom\nLLC, ett[.]ua, a Ukrainian telecommunications operator. This\nnew infrastructure has several overlaps with the infrastructure\nnoted in the CERT-UA reports, such as the use of the Dynamic\nDNS provider NO-IP with a domain masquerading as a\ntelecommunications provider operating in Ukraine, the use of\na TLS certificate from a free TLS certificate provider, and a\nserver banner that shares similarities with the banner seen on\nIP address 31[.]7[.]58[.]82 shown above in Figure 2.\n\n###### darkett[.]ddns[.]net\n\nIn addition to the ett[.]ddns[.]net domain, SecurityTrails\nbanner [data identifies a similarly named domain, darkett[.]](https://securitytrails.com/app/sb/ip/103.150.187.121/ports)\nddns[.]net, hosted on the same IP address, 103[.]150[.]187[.]121,\nas ett[.]ddns[.]net.

The web page features the Ukrainian-language text\n“ОДЕСЬКА ОБЛАСНА ВІЙСЬКОВА АДМІНІСТРАЦІЯ” which\ntranslates as “Odesa Regional Military Administration”, along\nwith “File is downloaded automatically” in English as shown in\nFigure 9 below.\n\n**_Figure 9: Screenshot of 103[.]150[.]187[.]121 (Source: URLScan)_**\n\n\nContained within the HTML of the webpage is a Base64encoded [ISO file that is deployed via the HTML smuggling](https://tria.ge/220916-nvj7wafff5)\ntechnique. This ISO file is set to auto-download when the website\nis visited. Figure 10 below shows the HTML content of the file.\n\n1 As part of the ongoing tracking of UAC-0113 activity, Insikt Group has\nidentified that as of September 5th, 2022, the staging servers, kievstar[.]online,\nand IP address 103[.]150[.]187[.]121 have been updated and are now serving\nnew malicious lure files via HTML smuggling. The newly identified lure files\nmasquerade as a “password leak” and deliver Eternity Stealer malware.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 10: The HTML content for the IP address 103[.]150[.]187[.]121 (with Base64-encoded data_**\n_removed), August 8, 2022 (Source: URLScan)_\n\nInsikt Group inspected the web page’s HTML, and identified\nembedded JavaScript, which assists in the malicious ISO delivery\nbehavior of the page. Testing the functionality of the for loop on\nlines 26 to 28 does not change the Base64-encoded data held\nin the variable “binary”. The for loop attempts to take away the\ninteger value 11 from the characters that make up the Base64\nstring. JavaScript will produce an error when attempting to\nsubtract an integer from a char, resulting in its value not being\nupdated. The Base64 contents of the variable “binary” will be\nexactly the same after going through the for loop, making it\nredundant, and the Base64 data will still correctly decode to\nan ISO file.\n\nThe purpose of the inclusion of this routine by UAC-0113\ncould be due to operator error, as its functionality serves no\npurpose because strings are immutable objects in JavaScript.\n\n[Of note, a report by Palo Alto’s Unit42 details a similar HTML](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/cloaked-ursa-online-storage-services-campaigns/)\nSmuggling routine used by APT29 in a separate campaign to\ndownload an ISO file, shown below in Figure 11. APT29’s original\nuse of this routine was for a binary array, which helps to\npotentially illuminate UAC-0113’s redundant for loop’s original\npurpose. APT29’s HTML and JavaScript code has similar overlaps\nwith the UAC-0113 linked sample shown in Figure 10 above.\n\n\n_Figure 11 : Screenshot of HTML content, used by APT29, from hXXps://porodicno[.]ba/wp-content/_\n_Agenda[.]html (with the array of decimal values of obfuscated payload abbreviated with the use of_\n_[“......”) (Source: URLScan)](https://urlscan.io/result/5ebffdb2-792b-45fd-87c1-78f075200272/dom/)_\n\nAPT29’s correctly functioning for loop routine can be seen on\nlines 11-13 shown in Figure 11 above and further detailed in Figure\n12 below, which is used to subtract the integer 17 from each of\nthe decimal values in the variable “d”, which deobfuscates the\nmalicious ISO payload.\n\nFurther comparison of the 2 routines highlights some\ncosmetic changes, possibly to frustrate security researchers and\nhinder signaturing of these functions.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_[Figure 12: Screenshot of the for loop used by APT29 in hXXps://porodicno[.]ba/wp-content/Agenda[.]html (Source: URLScan)](https://urlscan.io/result/5ebffdb2-792b-45fd-87c1-78f075200272/dom/)_**\n\n**_Figure 13: Screenshot of the for loop used by UAC-0113 in 103[.]150[.]187[.]121 (Source: URLScan)_**\n\n\nIt is currently unknown why there is a similarity overlap\nbetween the 2 threat actor groups’ use of this ISO delivery\nfunctionality; one hypothesis is that UAC-0113 took inspiration\nfrom or directly copied this functionality from open source\nreporting on APT29, or that the same open source resource was\nused as a codebase.\n\n###### Malware Analysis\n\nAn analysis of the UAC-0113 ISO file and its content was\nconducted by Insikt Group and is detailed in the following\nsections.\n\n\n###### 3_ЗАЯВА-на-отримання-компенсації.iso\n\nA Base64-encoded ISO file, titled “3_ЗАЯВА-на-отриманнякомпенсації.iso” (SHA256: [1c6643b479614340097a8071c9f](https://tria.ge/220916-nvj7wafff5)\n[880688af5a82db7b6e755beafe7301eea1abf) was found within](https://tria.ge/220916-nvj7wafff5)\nthe HTML of IP address 103[.]150[.]187[.]121.

The first PE file is a copy of Colibri\nLoader that is written to “C:\\ProgramData\\conhost.exe” and\nexecuted. The second PE file is a copy of WarzoneRAT that is\ninjected into a spawned copy of jfilyg7.exe via process hollowing.\n\n2 https[:]//fr3d[.]hk/blog/colibri-loader-back-to-basics\n\n\n### Colibri Loader\n\n\nColibri Loader’s conhost.exe process follows a similar pattern\nas jfilyg7.exe, as shown in Figure 18 below. It decrypts a PE file\npayload, spawns a copy of itself, and then uses process hollowing\nto execute the payload. The injected payload is another instance\nof Colibri Loader that is used to communicate with its C2 server\nand establish persistence on the victim machine.\n\nFor persistence, Colibri Loader drops a copy of itself in\n“%APPDATA%\\Local\\Microsoft\\WindowsApps” folder as GetVariable.exe.

The Get-Variable cmdlet is\nused as part of PowerShell’s initialization; however, PowerShell\nsearches for the cmdlet using the default path (containing the\nWindowsApps directory) first, and therefore executes the Colibri\npayload instead of the legitimate Get-Variable cmdlet.\n\nFinally, the Colibri Loader process begins communication\nwith its C2. To do this, it generates a UID3 based on the victim\nmachine’s serial number and sends it via a “check” command to\nthe C2. Once the C2 responds, it follows up with an “update”\ncommand to provide the C2 with information about the victim\nmachine. It then sends a “ping” command that is used to check\nfor further instructions from the C2, such as downloading a new\npayload or cleaning up an infected system.\n\nA full configuration extraction of the Colibri Loader sample\nis provided below in Table 2.

It employs 2 methods: a batch file placed in\nthe user’s Startup folder and a registry run key.\n\nWarzone RAT drops a copy of itself in the “ApplicationData”\n[alternate data stream (ADS) of a file named “Documents” located](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2015/07/introduction-to-alternate-data-streams)\nin the user’s Documents folder. A batch file named “programs.\nbat” is also created and placed in the user’s “%AppData%\\\nRoaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup”\nfolder. This file contains commands to loop through another\nADS stored in the “programs.bat” file named “start” and\nexecutes each line within the stream. The “programs.bat:start”\nADS contains a wmic command to create a process from the\nDocuments:ApplicationData ADS. The full contents of the\nprograms.bat file and its start ADS are provided in Figures 20\nand 21.\n\nfor /F “usebackq tokens=*” %%A in (“C:\\\nUsers\\<user>\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\\n```\nStart Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\programs.bat:start”)\n\n```\ndo %%A\n\n_Figure 20: Contents of Warzone RAT’s programs.bat file (Source: Recorded Future)_\n\nwmic process call create ‘”C:\\Users\\<user>\\\nDocuments\\Documents:ApplicationData”’\n\n_Figure 21: Contents of Warzone RAT’s programs.bat:start ADS (Source: Recorded Future)_\n\nFor the other persistence method, Warzone RAT drops a copy\nof itself in the user’s Documents folder as MSCommonDriver.exe\nand sets the registry run key shown below to the dropped file’s\npath. The file name MSCommonDriver.exe has also previously\n[been used by UAC-0113 during their deployment of DarkCrystal](https://cert.gov.ua/article/405538)\nRAT.\n\n|Item|Value|\n|---|---|\n|Version|1.2.0|\n|Botnet|Build1|\n|C2 Addresses|hXXp://zpltcmgodhvvedxtfcygvbg­ jkvgvcguygytfigj[.]cc/gate.php|\n||hXXp://yugyuvyugguitgyuigtfyutdtogh­ ghbbgyv[.]cx/gate.php|\n\n\n-----\n\n\\REGISTRY\\MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\\n```\nCurrentVersion\\Run\\MSCommonDriver\n\n```\n_Figure 22: Warzone RAT’s registry run key used for persistence (Source: Recorded Future)_\n\nThe MSCommonDriver.exe is also executed and then begins\ncommunicating with the Warzone RAT C2 located at darkfox[.]\nddns[.]net on port 443.\n\n**Domain** **Port**\n\ndarkfox[.]ddns[.]net 443\n\ndarksea[.]ddns[.]net 443\n\n_Table 3: Extracted Warzone C2 configuration (Source: Recorded Future)_\n\n###### ЗАЯВА/3_ЗАЯВА-на-отримання-компенсації- додаткової-знижки-сімям-загиблих2.doc\n\nA decoy document, titled “3_ЗАЯВА-на-отриманнякомпенсації-додаткової-знижки-сімям-загиблих2.doc”, found\ninside the folder “ЗАЯВА”, is shown in Figure 23. The document\nis opened via the commands executed by the aforementioned\nLNK file ЗАЯВА-на-отримання-компенсації.lnk. The folder and\ndocument translate from Ukrainian to English as “APPLICATION”\nand “3_APPLICATION-for-receiving-compensation-additionaldiscount-for-the-families-of-the-deceased2.doc”, respectively.\n\nThe document itself does not engage in malicious activity\nbut is used to hide the operations undertaken by the malicious\nLNK file. The Ukrainian-language text details that the document\nis an application for citizens to request discounts on fuel from\nthe head of the Zaporozhye Regional Department for Social\nProtection in the Oleksandrivka Raion (district), an area in\nDonetsk.\n\n\n###### Colibri Loader and Warzone Rat C2 Analysis\n\n Colibri Loader C2 Servers\n\nNetwork analysis of the Colibri Loader sample\nreveals communication to 2 distinct domains,\nyugyuvyugguitgyuigtfyutdtoghghbbgyv[.]cx, which as of\nAugust 1, 2022, resolves to IP address 65[.]108[.]213[.]210, and\nzpltcmgodhvvedxtfcygvbgjkvgvcguygytfigj[.]cc, which between\nJune 28, 2022, and up until July 28, 2022, also resolved to the\naforementioned IP address 65[.]108[.]213[.]210.

Users should conduct the\nfollowing measures to detect and mitigate activity associated\nwith these pieces of malware:\n\n  - Configure your intrusion detection systems (IDS),\n\nintrusion prevention systems (IPS), or any network\ndefense mechanisms in place to alert on — and upon\nreview, consider blocking connection attempts to and\nfrom — the external IP addresses and domains listed in\nthe appendix.\n\n  - Recorded Future Hunting Packages can be used to\n\nhunt for the presence of malicious files associated with\nWarzone RAT and Colibri Loader. YARA rules for each\nmalware family can be found in Appendix D.\n\n  - Recorded Future proactively detects malicious server\n\nconfigurations and provides means to block them in\nthe Command and Control Security Control Feed. The\nCommand and Control Feed includes tools used by\nUAC-0113 and other Russian state-sponsored threat\nactivity groups. Recorded Future clients should alert on\nand block these C2 servers to allow for detection and\nremediation of active intrusions.\n\n  - Recorded Future Threat Intelligence (TI), Third-Party\n\n[Intelligence, and SecOps Intelligence modules users can](https://www.recordedfuture.com/license-options/)\nmonitor real-time output from Network Traffic Analysis\nanalytics to identify suspected targeted intrusion activity\ninvolving your organization or key vendors and partners.\n\n  - Monitor for domain abuse, such as typosquat domains\n\nspoofing your organization, through the Recorded\n[Future Brand Intelligence (BI) module. The SecurityTrails](https://www.recordedfuture.com/license-options/)\nextension is available to any customer that has a\nsubscription to the Threat Intelligence or Brand\nIntelligence modules. The LogoType source and alerting\nis exclusive to the BI module, though the TI module does\nhave access to the data via the Advanced Query Builder.\n\n|MikroTik Winbox: index: advtool.dll: 6.49.6 dhcp.dll: 6.49.6 hotspot.dll: 6.49.6 mpls.dll: 6.49.6 pim.dll: 6.49.6 ppp.dll: 6.49.6 roteros.dll: 6.49.6 roting4.dll: 6.49.6 secure.dll: 6.49.6 system.dll: 6.49.6 wlan6.dll: 6.49.6 list: advtool.jg: 6.49.6 dhcp.jg: 6.49.6 hotspot.jg: 6.49.6 icons.png: 6.49.6 icons24.png: icons32.png: mpls.jg: 6.49.6 pim.jg: 6.49.6 ppp.jg: 6.49.6 roteros.jg: 6.49.6 roting4.jg: 6.49.6 secure.jg: 6.49.6 wlan6.jg: 6.49.6|Col2|MikroTik Winbox: index: advtool.dll: 6.46.8 dhcp.dll: 6.46.8 hotspot.dll: 6.46.8 mpls.dll: 6.46.8 ppp.dll: 6.46.8 roteros.dll: 6.46.8 roting4.dll: 6.46.8 secure.dll: 6.46.8 system.dll: 6.46.8 wlan6.dll: 6.46.8 list: advtool.jg: 6.46.8 dhcp.jg: 6.46.8 hotspot.jg: 6.46.8 icons.png: 6.46.8 mpls.jg: 6.46.8 ppp.jg: 6.46.8 roteros.jg: 6.46.8 roting4.jg: 6.46.8 secure.jg: 6.46.8 wlan6.jg: 6.46.8|\n|---|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Outlook\n\nInsikt Group continues to track UAC-0113 infrastructure\nobserving changes in TTPs as its operations diversify across\nUkraine, this time with a significant focus on telecommunication\nproviders.
