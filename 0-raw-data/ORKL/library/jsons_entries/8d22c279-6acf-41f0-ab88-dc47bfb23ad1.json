Using data from [ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) and extortion](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/definition/ransomware-as-a-service-raas)\ngroups’ leak sites, Trend Micro’s open-source intelligence (OSINT) research, and the Trend\nMicro™ Smart Protection Network™, we mapped out the ransomware threat landscape of\nthe first quarter (from Jan. 1 to March 31) of 2022. We tracked ransomware activity with a\nfocus on the malicious actor groups behind the three ransomware families that pulled in the\n[highest numbers of successful attacks during this period: the notorious LockBit and Conti,](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/ransomware-spotlight/ransomware-spotlight-lockbit)\n[and the rising player BlackCat.](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/22/d/an-investigation-of-the-blackcat-ransomware.html)\n\n## Ransomware threats post year-on-year growth\n\nOur telemetry showed that during this three-month span, we detected and blocked a total of\n4,439,903 ransomware threats across email, URL, and file layers. This is a 36.6% increase\nin overall ransomware threats from the previous quarter (the fourth quarter of 2021), and a\n\n\n-----\n\n4.3% year-on-year rise (from the first quarter of 2021).\n\nThe number of RaaS and extortion groups grew by 63.2% in the first quarter of 2022 over the\nsame period the previous year, an increase that inevitably led to more organizations falling\nprey to ransomware activity. According to the ransomware groups’ leak sites, which recorded\nattacks on successfully compromised organizations that refused to pay the ransom,\nransomware victims rose by 29.2% year-on-year.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. The numbers of active RaaS and extortion groups and of victim organizations of\nsuccessful ransomware attacks in the first quarter of 2021 and the first quarter of 2022\n\n_Source: RaaS and extortion groups’ leak sites_\n\n## LockBit, Conti, and BlackCat’s for-hire attacks prevail\n\n\n-----\n\nThe three ransomware families that laid claim to the highest numbers of successful attacks in\nthe first quarter of 2022 were all widely known for operating under the RaaS model. Based\non data from the leak sites of their operators, 35.8% of these attacks were attributed to\nLockBit, while 19% belonged to Conti and 9.6% to BlackCat.\n\nFigure 2. The top three ransomware families used in successful RaaS and extortion attacks\nin terms of victim organizations in the first quarter of 2022\n\n_Source: RaaS and extortion groups’ leak sites_\n\nBased on our ransomware data, which tracked detections of ransomware attempts to\ncompromise organizations, LockBit and Conti were among the top 10 families detected in the\nentire first quarter of 2022. Meanwhile, BlackCat was among the top 10 ransomware families\ndetected in February and March 2022.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3. The numbers of ransomware file detections of LockBit, Conti, and BlackCat in\nmachines in each month of the first quarter of 2022\n\n_Source: Trend Micro™ Smart Protection Network™_\n\nOf the three, only Conti was among the top active ransomware families in the first quarter of\n2021, based on RaaS and extortion groups’ leak sites. In fact, Conti was first among them in\nthat period, racking up a victim count of 105. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)\nestimates that the group behind Conti, which Trend Micro tracks as [Water Goblin, has](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/22/c/cyberattacks-are-prominent-in-the-russia-ukraine-conflict.html)\namassed more than 1,000 victims and payouts amounting to over US$150 million as of\nJanuary 2022, making it one of the costliest ransomware families ever documented.\n\nRaaS providers like LockBit, detections of which were at their highest in the first quarter of\n2022 in February, have become an even more formidable threat since incorporating double\nextortion in their playbooks Under double extortion ransomware actors not only encrypt\n\n\n-----\n\ntheir victims data and demand payment in exchange for restoration of access, but they also\nput additional pressure on victims by threatening to release the data if the ransom is not\npaid. LockBit operators relied on this tactic after they took credit for an attack on France’s\nMinistry of Justice in January 2022, threatening to publish sensitive ministry data on the dark\nweb upon failure of payment.\n\nRelative to Conti and LockBit, BlackCat (aka AlphaVM, AlphaV, or ALPHV) is a newcomer; it\n[was first reported in November 2021 by researchers from MalwareHunterTeam. But what](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/125459/cyber-crime/blackcat-ransomware.html)\n[sets it apart from many other RaaS operators is its use of triple extortion, a tactic where](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/blackcat-ransomware/)\n[ransomware actors threaten to launch distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks on their](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/definition/distributed-denial-of-service-ddos)\nvictims’ infrastructure on top of leaking their data unless the ransom is paid. BlackCat\n[demands millions of US dollars in bitcoin or monero from its victims. It is shaping up to be a](https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/blackcat-ransomware-highly-configurable-rust-driven-raas-on-the-prowl-for-victims/)\nmajor contender in the underground marketplace, thanks to its generous payouts to its RaaS\n[affiliates, who can earn as much as 90% of paid ransoms.](https://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/aggressive-blackcat-ransomware-on-the-rise)\n\nBlackCat, which our detections showed was most active in the first quarter of 2022 in\nFebruary, has [successfully compromised at least 60 organizations around the world as of](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fbi-blackcat-ransomware-breached-at-least-60-entities-worldwide/)\nMarch. BlackCat is also notable for being the first professional ransomware family to be\nwritten in Rust. This is a major selling point for BlackCat, as Rust is considered a more\nsecure programming language that is capable of concurrent processing. As a cross-platform\nlanguage, Rust also makes it easier for threat actors to tailor malware to different operating\nsystems like Windows and Linux.\n\n## Ransomware attackers set their sights on small and medium-size businesses\n\nSmall businesses are often subjected to a huge volume of cyberattacks because malicious\n[actors believe that they have fewer resources to counter cyberthreats, while medium-size](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/threat-landscape/small-and-midsize-businesses-face-greater-cybersecurity-risks-and-challenges)\nones make compelling targets because they possess comparatively valuable assets.\n\nAccording to its leak site data, Conti staged attacks primarily on medium-size organizations\n(with 201 to 1,000 employees), accounting for 41.9% of its successful attacks in the first\nquarter of 2022, with the rest of its attacks evenly split between small businesses (with at\nmost 200 employees) and large enterprises (with more than 1,000 employees).\n\nIn contrast, 65.5% of LockBit’s successful attacks in the first quarter of 2022 affected small\nbusinesses, followed by medium-size companies at 20.5% and large enterprises at 10.5%.\nSimilarly, BlackCat victimized mostly small businesses in the first quarter of 2022, making up\n57.6% of its successful attacks, with medium-size organizations and large enterprises\nconstituting 25.4% and 17%, respectively.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4. The distribution by organization size of LockBit, Conti, and BlackCat’s successful\nattacks in terms of victim organizations in the first quarter of 2022\n\n_Source: LockBit, Conti, and BlackCat’s leak sites, and Trend Micro’s OSINT research_\n\n## Government, finance, and manufacturing industries grapple with onslaught of attacks\n\n\n-----\n\nOur telemetry showed that government agencies and financial companies consistently\nranked in the top three industries in terms of ransomware file detections from January to\nMarch 2022, followed by organizations in the manufacturing and fast-moving consumer\ngoods (FMCG) industries. Ransomware actors continued to beset government organizations,\nwhich also contended with high quantities of ransomware detections in the fourth quarter of\n2021.\n\nFigure 5. The top three industries in terms of ransomware file detections in machines in each\nmonth of the first quarter of 2022\n\n_Source: Trend Micro Smart Protection Network_\n\nOrganizations in finance and IT remained common targets of RaaS and extortion groups. In\na repeat of the first quarter of last year, ransomware groups’ leak sites showed that these\ntwo industries sustained the most attacks in the first quarter of 2022. Ransomware groups\n[have typically been drawn to financial companies not only for their valuable data, but also](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/modern-ransomware-shake-up-banking-government-transportation-sectors-in-1h-2021#IndustriesAsBigGameTargets)\nbecause their attack surface continues to expand as a result of increased connectivity and a\nmore distributed workforce.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6. The top 10 industries affected by successful RaaS and extortion attacks in terms of\nvictim organizations in the first quarter of 2022\n\n_Source: RaaS and extortion groups’ leak sites, and Trend Micro’s OSINT research_\n\nOur detections were more or less consistent with our findings from ransomware groups’ leak\nsites, where financial organizations bore the brunt — 12.7% — of LockBit’s successful\nattacks in the first quarter of 2022. The construction and manufacturing industries each made\nup 9.5% of LockBit’s victim count in the same period. This count included one of the world’s\nlargest tire manufacturers, which LockBit compromised in February.\n\n**Industry** **Victim count**\n\n\n-----\n\nFinance 28\n\nConstruction 21\n\nManufacturing 21\n\nIT 16\n\nProfessional services 16\n\nOthers 118\n\n**Total** **220**\n\nTable 1.

One notable Conti attack occurred in January,\nagainst [a Taiwanese electronics company that supplies components to the likes of Apple,](https://threatpost.com/conti-deadbolt-delta-qnap-ransomware/178083/)\nDell, and Tesla. Fortunately, only noncritical systems were affected, but the company’s highprofile clientele gives an idea of how ransomware attacks have the potential to also affect a\nvictim’s big-name clients.\n\n**Industry** Victim count\n\nManufacturing 15\n\nMaterials 12\n\nProfessional services 10\n\nConstruction 9\n\nIT 8\n\nOthers 63\n\nTotal **117**\n\nTable 2.

Additionally, the\nfinance and legal services industries each experienced 10.2% of BlackCat’s successful\nattacks. One organization that fell victim to BlackCat’s activity was [a Swiss aviation business,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/blackcat-alphv-claims-swissport-ransomware-attack-leaks-data/)\nwhich suffered a data leak in February that included the company’s internal memos and\ninformation on job applicants.\n\nIndustry Victim count\n\nProfessional services 8\n\nFinance 6\n\nLegal services 6\n\nApparel and fashion 5\n\nMaterials 5\n\nOthers 29\n\nTotal **59**\n\nTable 3.

The top 10 countries affected by successful RaaS and extortion attacks in terms of\nvictim organizations in the first quarter of 2022\n\n_Source: RaaS and extortion groups’ leak sites, and Trend Micro’s OSINT research_\n\nThe bulk — 40.5% — of LockBit’s victims in the first quarter of 2022 were organizations\nlocated in Europe, followed by those in North America at 34.1% and those in Asia-Pacific at\n10.9%. In particular, the US, Italy, and France experienced the most LockBit attacks. Even\n[though most of LockBit’s victims were based in Europe, the FBI noted in February that](https://www.zdnet.com/article/fbi-watch-out-for-lockbit-2-0-ransomware-heres-how-to-reduce-the-risk-to-your-network/)\n[LockBit’s latest known version, LockBit 2.0, was designed to identify and exclude Eastern](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/h/lockbit-resurfaces-with-version-2-0-ransomware-detections-in-chi.html)\nEuropean organizations from its attacks. LockBit’s previous version also had an automated\n\n\n-----\n\nvetting process that screened out systems in Russia and countries belonging to the\nCommonwealth of Independent States, possibly as a means of avoiding prosecution in these\ncountries.\n\nFigure 8. The top regions affected by LockBit’s successful attacks in terms of victim\norganizations in the first quarter of 2022\n\n_Source: LockBit’s leak site and Trend Micro’s OSINT research_\n\nIn February, Conti, which has [many members located in Russia, weighed in on the Russia-](https://www.wired.com/story/conti-ransomware-russia/)\n[Ukraine conflict and expressed its intent to retaliate against anyone who would stage](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/22/c/cyberattacks-are-prominent-in-the-russia-ukraine-conflict.html)\ncyberattacks on Russia. This might explain, in part, the regional distribution of its activity in\nthe first quarter of 2022: Organizations in North America were the most affected by its\n\n\n-----\n\nsuccessful attacks, making up 49.6% of its victims, whereas those in Europe accounted for\n41.9% and those in the Asia-Pacific region made up 6%. Most of Conti’s victims were in the\nUS, Germany, and the UK.\n\nFigure 9. The top regions affected by Conti’s successful attacks in terms of victim\norganizations in the first quarter of 2022\n\n_Source: Conti’s leak site and Trend Micro’s OSINT research_\n\nLike Conti, BlackCat focused its activity in the first quarter of 2022 on victims located in North\nAmerica, where 50.8% of its successful attacks took place. Its victims in Europe and AsiaPacific accounted for 25.4% and 18.6%, respectively. More specifically, it homed in on\ntargets in the US and Italy. In the first quarter of 2022, BlackCat was responsible for\nheadline-making attacks on prominent European companies, including a German fuel\ndistribution firm and [an Italian high-end fashion brand.](https://www.secureblink.com/cyber-security-news/moncler-group-becomes-the-first-victim-of-alphv-(blackcat)-raas-following-the-data-leak)\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 10.

Organizations should have policies in place that**\nrequire employees who access or store company data on their devices to enable\nmultifactor authentication, so that any sensitive information in these devices cannot be\neasily accessed.\n**Back up data. As much as possible, organizations should follow the “3-2-1 rule” to**\nprotect their important files: Create at least three backup copies in two different file\nformats, with one of those copies stored off-site.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Keep systems up to date. Organizations should update all of their applications,**\noperating systems, and other software as soon as patches are released by vendors\nand developers. Doing so can help prevent ransomware actors from exploiting\nvulnerabilities to gain access to organizations’ systems.\n**Verify emails before opening them. Organizations should train their employees to**\navoid downloading attachments or clicking on embedded links in emails from senders\nthey do not recognize, as malicious actors bank on these as means to install\nransomware.\n**Follow established security frameworks. Organizations can develop cybersecurity**\nstrategies based on the security frameworks created by the Center of Internet Security\n(CIS) and [the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The security](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework)\nmeasures and best practices laid out in these frameworks can serve as a guide for\norganizations’ security teams as they design their own threat mitigation plans.\n\nOrganizations can augment their cybersecurity infrastructure with multilayered detection and\nresponse solutions that can anticipate and respond to ransomware movements before\n[operators can carry out an attack. One such solution is Trend Micro Vision One™, which is](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/business/products/detection-response.html)\nequipped with extended detection and response (XDR) capabilities that gather and\nautomatically correlate data across multiple security layers — including email, endpoints,\nservers, cloud workloads, and networks — to avert ransomware attack attempts.\n\nOrganizations can also benefit from solutions with network detection and response (NDR)\ncapabilities, which can give them greater visibility over their network traffic. Among these\n[solutions is Trend Micro Network One™, which provides security teams with the critical](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/business/products/network.html)\nnetwork telemetry they need to form a clearer picture of their environment, accelerate their\nresponse, and prevent future attacks.\n\nThe supplementary data sheet for this report, including data from RaaS and extortion groups’\nleak sites, Trend Micro’s OSINT research, and the Trend Micro Smart Protection Network,\n[can be downloaded here.](https://documents.trendmicro.com/assets/pdf/datasheet-ransomware-in-Q1-2022.pdf)\n\n**_With contributions by Matsugaya Shingo_**\n\nHIDE\n\n**Like it?
