This campaign infected victims with Sakula malware**\n\n**variants that were signed with stolen certificates. Investigation into this activity led to associations�**\n\n**with the adversary known to CrowdStrike as DEEP PANDA.**\n\n**On 31 July 2014, an executable was identified, which, at the time, was not detected by any anti-�**\n\n**virus products. When this file was executed, it caused the victim to view a website by using the�**\n\n**ShellExecute() API to open a URL. The site’s domain name was meant to spoof that of a site set**\n\n**up to provide information on an alumni event for a U.S university. This page requested that the**\n\n**visitor download an Adobe-related plugin in order to view the content. The downloaded plugin file�**\n\n**included a variant of Sakula malware. [1]**\n\n\n-----\n\n**technique most commonly associated with PlugX activity. In the aforementioned university-**\n\n**related incidents, a legitimate executable named MediaSoft.exe (MD5 hash:**\n\n**d00b3169f45e74bb22a1cd684341b14a) loaded a file named msi.dll (MD5 hash:�**\n\n**ae6f33f6cdc25dc4bda24b2bccff79fe), which, in turn, was used to load the Sakula executable**\n\n**(MD5 hash: 0c2674c3a97c53082187d930efb645c2). This final executable was also signed with a�**\n\n**certificate assigned to an organization called DTOPTOOLZ Co., Ltd.�**\n\n**Command-and-Control (C2) communications in this incident went directly to IP address**\n\n**180.210.206.246; a sample GET request is below:**\n\n**Further investigation revealed similar activity stretching back to at least April 2014, when similar**\n\n**TTPs were used to target a healthcare organization and a U.S.-based IT company with high-**\n\n**profile clients in the defense sector. Two other incidents were also identified in August 2014�**\n\n**targeting a company in the DIB and a Mongolian government entity.**\n\n**All incidents in this campaign were similar in that they utilized malicious droppers masquerading**\n\n**as installers for legitimate software applications like Adobe Reader, Juniper VPN, and Microsoft**\n\n**ActiveX Control. They display progress bars that make it appear as if the specified software is�**\n\n**being updated or installed.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**In addition, the droppers all directed victims to login pages for services specific to the target�**\n\n**organization like webmail, document sharing, or corporate VPN. In all cases except one, the**\n\n**victims were directed to legitimate login pages. The one exception was a case in which victims**\n\n**were sent to a login page hosted on a domain that spoofed that of the legitimate one. It is unclear**\n\n**whether redirecting victims to these login pages was part of credential-collection activity or merely**\n\n**meant to deceive victims into believing that the activity was legitimate.**\n\n**Example of a Login Page that Victims were Redirected to**\n\n**The campaign appeared to be over by the end of August, but a file was recently discovered that�**\n\n**suggests it may be ongoing. The intended target again appeared to be a Mongolian government**\n\n**entity, and the file masqueraded as an installer for Microsoft ActiveX software. It dropped the�**\n\n**side-loaded Sakula malware just like in the other incidents; however, in this instance, the Sakula**\n\n**payload was signed with a certificate assigned to a different organization, Career Credit Co., Ltd.�**\n\n**The malware used the domain www[.]xha-mster[.]com for C2 which was created in mid-**\n\n**September and is registered with the email address wendellom@yahoo.com and registrant name**\n\n**“tonyy starke” (hence the name, Ironman-related title for this blog).**\n\n**Below is a chart showing the relevant relationships to this DEEP PANDA campaign.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**The bottom of the chart shows an infrastructure connection between an IP address**\n\n**(198.200.45.112) used this campaign and also used in recently observed DEEP PANDA activity.**\n\n**Association with Recent Scanbox Activity**\n\n**In September 2014, CrowdStrike Intelligence identified a malicious file signed with the�**\n\n**DTOPTOOLZ Co., Ltd. certificate. Analysis of this file revealed it to be Derusbi malware (a favorite�**\n\n**RAT of DEEP PANDA) that used the domain vpn[.]foundationssl[.]com for its C2. At the time of**\n\n**discovery, CrowdStrike did not attribute the file to DEEP PANDA based on the malware alone,�**\n\n**but the use of the DTOPTOOLZ certificate to sign a malware variant known to be heavily used by�**\n\n**this adversary makes it likely that this signed Derusbi sample is also attributable to DEEP**\n\n**PANDA.**\n\n**In a recent public report from** **[PWC, another foundationssl[.]com domain was linked to activity](http://pwc.blogs.com/cyber_security_updates/2014/10/scanbox-framework-whos-affected-and-whos-using-it-1.html)**\n\n**involving the Strategic Web Compromise (SWC) framework more commonly known as**\n\n**Scanbox. In that operation, the Scanbox code was placed on the website of a U.S.-based think**\n\n**tank and utilized the malicious domain, news[.]foundationssl[.]com. The use of the two**\n\n**_foundationssl[.]com subdomains suggests that the same adversary (in this case DEEP PANDA)_**\n\n**was responsible for the signed Derusbi malware file and the think tank SWC activity.�**\n\n**[Furthermore, CrowdStrike publicly reported on DEEP PANDA targeting of think tanks in July](http://blog.crowdstrike.com/deep-thought-chinese-targeting-national-security-think-tanks/)**\n\n**2014.**\n\n**If you want to hear more about DEEP PANDA and their tradecraft or any of the other adversaries**\n\n**that CrowdStrike tracks, please contact:** **[sales@crowdstrike.com](mailto:sales@crowdstrike.com)**\n\n**[1] In February 2014, CrowdStrike publicly reported on a campaign that leveraged Sakula**\n\n\n-----\n\n## ← December CrowdCast: Rockin’ Around Your Unsecured Network\n\n\n## Cloud-Based Security: The Next Generation of Defense for the Good Guys\n →\n\n\n## Recent Posts\n\n The Imperative for Proactive Incident Response in 2015 and Beyond\n\n**November 3, 2015**\n\n## Why Your Business Environment Should Drive Cybersecurity\n\n\n-----\n\n|M|T|W|T|F|S|S|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|||||||1|\n|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|\n|9|10|11|12|13|14|15|\n|16|17|18|19|20|21|22|\n|23|24|25|26|27|28|29|\n|30|||||||\n\n\n## Archives\n\n### N O V E M B E R 2 0 1 5\n\n**M** **T** **W** **T** **F** **S** **S**\n\n**1**\n\n**[2](http://blog.crowdstrike.com/2015/11/02/)** **[3](http://blog.crowdstrike.com/2015/11/03/)** **4** **5** **6** **7** **8**\n\n**9** **10** **11** **12** **[13](http://blog.crowdstrike.com/2015/11/13/)** **14** **15**\n\n**16** **17** **[18](http://blog.crowdstrike.com/2015/11/18/)** **19** **20** **21** **22**\n\n**23** **24** **25** **26** **27** **28** **29**\n\n**30**\n\n**[« Oct](http://blog.crowdstrike.com/2015/10/)**\n\n\n## Recent Comments\n\n\n-----",
