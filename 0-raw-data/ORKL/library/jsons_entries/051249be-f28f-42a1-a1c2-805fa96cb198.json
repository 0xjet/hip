In this blog post I’ll show you somenew techniques that they’ve\nrecently adopted to increase their financial gain and to improve their operational security.\n\nCybersecurity: This TA505 threat acteur is active at least since 2014.Thomas Barabosch\ngives an overview of the hacking tools that TA505 currently uses.\n\nTA505 is a cybercrime threat actor that conducts Big Game Hunting operations. In short, Big\nGame Hunting means selectively targeting organizations with ransomware in order to\nachieve huge ransom payouts Today organizations should treat ransomware events also as\n\n\n-----\n\ndata breaches since ransomware actors steal data before encrypting it and leverage this\ndata during the negotiation phase. If the victim organization does not pay the ransom,\nransomware gangs publish the stolen data on their data leak websites. TA505 runs their own\ndata leak website “CL0P^-LEAKS”. In addition to these Big Game Hunting operations, there\nis also a possible connection to another, [more targeted activity cluster, which is closely](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/01/stomp-2-dis-brilliance-in-the-visual-basics.html)\nrelated to TA505. Want to dive deeper here?\n\nSince the beginning of June 2020, TA505 continues their operation with massive spam\ncampaigns. Within a couple of days, they have run several campaigns: on 2020-06-02 and\n2020-06-03, they started by targeting Germany, on 2020-06-04 and 2020-06-05, I observed\nthem targeting Canada, and on 2020-06-08 as well as 2020-06-12, they ran a rather broad\ncampaigns targeting many countries worldwide including Europe (Germany, Slovakia, UK)\nand America (USA). In this blog post, I review the recently observed activities and point out\nsome interesting changes.\n\n## Same TTPs with some interesting changes\n\nThe TTPs that I have observed since the return of TA505 align mostly with the TTPs from\nearlier this year. To sum up, the initial attack vector is still spam. This spam carries a HTML\nfile that redirects the victim via compromised websites to a XLS maldoc. The maldoc\n[comprises macros and asks the victim to enable them. Once enabled, the XLS maldoc drops](https://www.telekom.com/en/blog/group/article/cybersecurity-ta505-s-box-of-chocolate-597672)\n[their downloader called Get2, which in turn downloads their Remote Administration Tool](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.get2)\n(RAT) [SDBBot. From this point on, we must assume that a human operator explores the](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.sdbbot)\n[local network and as an ultimate goal may deploy the ransomware Clop. This is common in](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.clop)\ntoday’s [human-operated ransomware attacks.](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/03/05/human-operated-ransomware-attacks-a-preventable-disaster/)\n\nSo far, so good. But there are some notable changes that I observed within the last months.\nSince the beginning of this year, their HTML redirectors that they attach to their spam mails\nmimic the DDoS protection service of Cloudflare in order to make the victim believe that they\nare redirected by a legitimate service.\n\nDDoS protection service of Cloudflare.\n\nSince this month, they added the Google service “reCAPTCHA” to these HTML redirectors.\nOn one side, this increases credibility from the victim’s point of view. On the other side, this\nhinders automatic analysis of their infrastructure by sandbox systems and individual\nresearchers.\n\nGoogle service “reCAPTCHA”.\n\nAnother interesting change is that TA505 jumped on the data leak bandwagon. Today,\nransomware actors steal data from victim networks before they actually conduct the\nransomware attack. During the negotiation phase of the ransom, these actors utilize this\nstolen data in order to increase the pressure on the victim and threaten to publish the data if\n\n\n-----\n\nthe victim does not pay. TA505 created their data leak website CL0P -LEAKS for exactly\nthis purpose. As a consequence, victims of these recent TA505 campaigns should not only\ntreat this as a ransomware event but they should also prepare for a possible data breach.\n\nData leak website “CL0P^-LEAKS”.\n\n## SDBBot beefs up with Certificate Pinning\n\n[SDBBot is TA505’s currently preferred RAT, which they use during the human-operated](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.sdbbot)\nphase of their ransomware attacks. During the spam campaigns that I observed in June\n2020, they continued to distribute SDBBot to their victims.\n\nSDBBot went through a number of iterations when looking at its version numbers. For\ninstance, samples that TA505 distributed in November 2019 were tagged with version\nnumber 2.3. The samples that they distributed in June 2020 are tagged with version number\n3.9.\n\nOne addition that stroke my eye was the addition of Transport Layer Security (TLS) to ensure\ncommunication security. TLS is definitely on the rise in malware. It is estimated that almost\none quarter of malware utilizes TLS for its communication. SDBBot’s actual implementation\n[is based on the open source TLS library “Mbed TLS”. While using TLS is not out of the](https://tls.mbed.org/)\n[ordinary for malware in 2020, SDBBot comes with certificate pinning, which is not very](https://owasp.org/www-community/controls/Certificate_and_Public_Key_Pinning)\ncommon for Windows-based cybercrime malware. In a nutshell, the malware comes with an\nembedded X509 certificate that is associated with its command and control (CC) server.\nWhen the malware connects to its CC server, it checks if the server’s X509 certificate\nmatches its embedded certificate. If it does not match, then the malware refuses to talk to the\nCC server. The following screenshot shows the embedded X509 certificate observed in a\nSDBBot samples from 2020-06-08.\n\nEmbedded X509 certificate observed in a SDBBot samples from 2020-06-08.\n\nThe use of TLS and certificate pinning has three consequences. First, the communication\nbetween bot and CC server is cryptographically protected and eavesdropping is not possible\nwithout intrusive measures. Second, the certificate pinning ensures that bots cannot be taken\nover by claiming the CC server’s domain. Third, the reverse engineering of the malware’s\ncommunication protocol is more difficult since analysts have to patch the embedded\ncertificate in order to make the malware talk to them.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTA505 is back and they probably will not go away soon. They continue with mostly the same\nTTPs that they utilized since at least Summer 2019. However, they naturally evolve and\nadjust their tactics to ensure constant success of their operations. On the one hand, they\n\n\n-----\n\njumped on the data leak bandwagon with their website CL0P -LEAKS . On the other hand,\nthey continue to improve their tools like SDBBot, which gained new features like certificate\npinning.\n\n## Appendix: List of IoCs\n\nIoC Description\n\ne3f57d7d933d19d190ff27ec455875ac SDBBot installer x86, version 3.9\n\na66e9afbba9b0f014d0774070b59c79e SDBBot installer x64, version 3.9\n\ns77657453-onedrive[.]com SDBBot domain (2020-06-12)\n\ns89065339-onedrive[.]com SDBBot domain (2020-06-12)\n\ns3-ap-southeast-1-amazonaws[.]com SDBBot domain (2020-06-02)\n\ns3-ap-southeast-2-amazonaws[.]com SDBBot domain (2020-06-02)\n\n[On topicCybersecurity: TA505’s Box of Chocolate](https://www.telekom.com/en/blog/group/article/cybersecurity-ta505-s-box-of-chocolate-597672)\n\n[Cybersecurity: Dissecting Emotet - part one](https://www.telekom.com/en/blog/group/article/cybersecurity-dissecting-emotet-part-one-592612)\n\n[Cybersecurity: Dissecting Emotet - part two](https://www.telekom.com/en/blog/group/article/cybersecurity-dissecting-emotet-part-two-596128)\n\n[Media information: Telekom presents current figures on cyber security](https://www.telekom.com/en/media/media-information/archive/telekom-presents-current-figures-on-cyber-security-573050)\n\n[Media information: The Global Guardian never sleeps](https://www.telekom.com/en/media/media-information/archive/the-global-guardian-never-sleeps-582556)\n\n\n-----",
