    "plain_text": "# CyOps Lighthouse: Vidar Stealer\n\n**cynet.com/blog/cyops-lighthouse-vidar-stealer/**\n\nJanuary 12, 2023\n\nThe Darknet is home to many underground hacking forums. In these forums, cybercriminals\ntalk freely: Sharing stories, tactics, success stories, and failures. Their conduct allows us to\npeek into the politics and ethics of those groups and actors, as they talk about recent\nactivities.\n\nCyOps Lighthouse aims to shed a light on those dark places. Apart from the underground\nforums, we will also provide information regarding ongoing ransomware groups’ publications\nand worthy mentions from the last month.\n\n## Vidar Stealer – the attacker’s perspective\n\n Executive summary:\n\nVidar stealer is a malware that is offered for sale in the MAAS (Malware as a service) model.\n\nIt is present since 2018, and it is a variant of the “Arkei stealer”.\n\nVidar is currently one of the top stealers that are available for sale and is responsible for a\nlarge sum of compromised credentials offered for sale on underground forums and\nmarketplaces.\n\n## Analysis:\n\n\n-----\n\nVidar stealer works as a MAAS, but unlike other stealers where buyers need to set their C2\nand operate from it, all Vidar admin operations are done via a dedicated website, that can be\naccessed either with a dedicated Onion address or a regular “Clearnet” website, when\nentering the main URL we are greeted with the following:\n\nAn ode to Vidar, son of Odin and the god of vengeance.\n\nOnce we add the “Login” prompt to the URL, we can see Vidar’s operator login page:\n\nUpon successful login, we will be greeted with the main Vidar panel:\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nThe default login will show us the Dashboard, a summary of all the operations taken by the\noperator, the number of infected machines, geolocation, Builder version (Updates\nautomatically), the current funds available at the crypto wallet, and all the stealers’ options\nand possibilities on the left.\n\nThe “Logs” section is divided into several subcategories:\n\n“All logs” is like the dashboard, it will show all logs in a given timeframe, with emphasis on\nthe log contents:\n\n“Files” will show all files that were exfiltrated by the stealer:\n\n\n-----\n\nPasswords is self-explanatory, and Logs for download will show all logs that are ready for\ndownload.\n\nAs Vidar aims to be a “One stop shop”, it also provides the operators with a “Services” panel,\nwhere they can filter and sign in directly to any SMTP/Banking/Cpanels/WordPress websites\nthat were found in the logs.\n\nMoving over the “Workers” (Active bots) and “Statistics”, the settings panel is one of the most\nimportant assets of an operator.\n\nUnder the main page, an operator can decide what assets to target on the infected host, as\nwell as set rules for “Grabber” – file exfiltration module, or “Loader” – set a rule for a followup activity on infected hosts.\n\nSettings:\n\nGrabber (Specify files type, max size, and folders to exfiltrate data):\n\n\n-----\n\nLoader:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe “Builder” tab related to creating an executable from the panel, can be adjusted to set\nmultiple running campaigns with different targets in mind, it also includes all the “Builder\nupdates” – any constant updates that are pushed by the Vidar team:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe builder tab is also where operators activate their subscription, according to the required\ntimeframe:\n\n## Conclusion:\n\nVidar is among the top info stealers on the MAAS market.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt offers multiple Follow up activities as seen above, and all in the same Operator panel, this\nmakes their pricing a bit higher than other info stealers, but as the operation is going for a\nlong period, Vidar has already amassed a reputation of a reliable malware.\n\nAs we noticed in May 2022, Vidar is also one of the main sources for info stealer logs on\nunderground markets like “Russian Marketplace”:\n\nVidar, like other info stealers, is not “just” a stealer, it is responsible for most compromised\ncredentials offered on the darknet and can also be used as a loader for Ransomware to\nfollow up after a successful infection.\n\n**We strongly believe that unless an OPSEC mistake was to happen from the Vidar**\n**team, they will remain a top threat to reckon with in 2023.**\n\n\n-----",
