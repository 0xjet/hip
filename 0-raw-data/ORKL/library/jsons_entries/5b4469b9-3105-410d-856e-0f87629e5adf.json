Start the Fire: Hacktivists Increasingly Claim Targeting of OT Systems\n\n**[mandiant.com/resources/blog/hacktivists-targeting-ot-systems](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/hacktivists-targeting-ot-systems)**\n\nIn January 2023, the Anonymous affiliated hacktivist group, GhostSec, claimed on social\nmedia to have deployed ransomware to encrypt a Belarusian remote terminal unit (RTU)—a\ntype of operational technology (OT) device for remote monitoring of industrial automation\ndevices. The actors’ stated intention was to demonstrate support for Ukraine in the ongoing\nRussian invasion. Researchers, OT security professionals and media outlets analyzed the\nclaims and concluded that the actor overstated the implications of the alleged attack.\n\nAlthough there was no significant impact in this particular incident, the event highlights the\nincreasing need for a wider discussion regarding the extent of risk hacktivists pose to OT\nenvironments. For the last several years, Mandiant has tracked various hacktivists' claims of\ntargeting OT systems claiming physical damage as a result. Exacerbated by geopolitical\n\n\n-----\n\ntensions in different regions—such as Russia s ongoing invasion of Ukraine—these actors\nhave recently intensified their activity, resulting in more frequent claims and new avenues to\nimpact targets.\n\nIn most cases, hacktivists’ claims are exaggerated or unsubstantiated. The number of false\nclaims is at times challenging to debunk. However, despite the inaccuracy of most claims,\nwhen hacktivist activity targeting OT becomes commonplace, the likelihood of actual and\neven substantial OT incidents increases. The risk is higher for organizations that are\nperceptibly associated with political events or social disputes based on geographic location,\nnationality, language, or industry of relevance.\n\nIn this blog post, Mandiant offers a comprehensive analysis of recent hacktivist activity\ntargeting OT systems. Mandiant was able to leverage information from previously\nundisclosed and known incidents to discuss the potential implications for OT defenders.\nAwareness about emerging hacktivism trends helps OT defenders to prioritize\ncountermeasures and differentiate state-sponsored fronts leveraging the hacktivism cloak.\n\n## Hacktivists Increasingly Claim to Target and Impact OT\n\nIn 2021, Mandiant published a blog post describing an increasing trend in low sophistication\ncompromises where actors targeted internet-exposed assets across multiple industries. Most\nof the cases we analyzed were seemingly conducted for financial or opportunistic\nmotivations. But others were conducted with ideological motivations by hacktivist groups\nclaiming to target OT devices or releasing training tutorials to inform other actors how to\nattack OT systems.\n\nOne year later in 2022, Mandiant observed more than twice as many hacktivist claims\ntargeting OT as compared to 2021. The majority of cases Mandiant tracked in 2022 were\nconducted by actors in support of Ukraine—although we also observed instances in favor of\nRussia. Additionally, Mandiant noted an interesting trend where hacktivist actors focused\ntheir targeting on organizations in the Middle East, likely in response to political tensions in\nthe region. Figure 1 illustrates some relevant keywords we observed across different\nhacktivist claims.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1: Common keywords observed across hacktivist claims\nWhile in most cases, Mandiant was not able to fully validate the actors’ claims, we assess\nwith moderate confidence that hacktivist actors have more often than not, overstated the\neffects and impact of their attacks. In other cases, it is possible hacktivists provided\nquestionable claims about their independence or non-affiliation with government-sponsored\ngroups.\n\nNevertheless, in the majority of the cases, the actors provided evidence of at least being\nproficient in accessing unidentified internet-exposed OT assets. It is important to note that\nthere are also multiple other cases, wherein the actors targeted IT assets from OT\norganizations, however for the purpose of this analysis, we are not including those instances.\n\n## Trends in Hacktivist Activity Targeting OT\n\nThroughout 2022, the majority of hacktivist claims that Mandiant observed targeting OT\nfollowed similar techniques, tactics and procedures (TTPs) and behavioral patterns. The\nactors often leveraged similar social media and messaging channels and targeted victims in\nthe same way.\n\nMost often, the hacktivists likely gained initial access via insecure, internet accessible\ndevices or public-facing applications. This allowed them to execute actions via commandline, or graphical user interfaces (See the Appendix for a list of MITRE ATT&CK for ICS\ntactics and techniques used by hacktivists targeting OT). While these types of techniques\nhave historically been used to conduct low sophistication OT compromises, we recently\nobserved some unique trends that indicate changes from baseline activity.\n\n### Hacktivists Increasingly Use Public Forums and Social Media Platforms to Post Claims\n\n\n-----\n\nHistorically, hacktivist claims of compromising OT systems were distributed exclusively\nacross closed audiences via underground forums or private communication channels.\nHowever, recent claims have also been promoted via dedicated assets affiliated with the\nactors on public forums and popular social media platforms. These methods help the actors\nto gain public attention via media and specialized publications, enabling them to leverage\nclaimed OT compromises to grow their reputations, gain notoriety, and spread their promoted\nmessaging across broader audiences. A negative effect of this trend is that the amplification\nof such activity can also inspire other actors to build offensive OT-oriented capabilities.\n\n### Hacktivists Support Both International and Domestic Political Narratives\n\nMost recent OT-oriented hacktivist activity was allegedly conducted in response to\ngeopolitical events—with the vast majority of that activity targeting Russia as a result of its\ninvasion in Ukraine, as well as targeting Israeli regional policies. These hacktivists often\ndepicted their OT-oriented operations as contributing to militias fighting on behalf of Ukraine\nor Palestine.\n\nThe most active group we tracked in 2022 was Team OneFist (also known as Joint Cyber\nCenter). Team OneFist issued multiple claims via social media, alleging to conduct attacks\nagainst power plants, an airport, uninterruptible power supply (UPS systems), a paper mill,\nand SCADA systems, among others. The actor’s promoted narrative suggests the group’s\nmain motivation is to target Russian organizations in support of Ukraine.\n\nFigure 2: Social media posts claiming Team OneFist involvement in attack targeting Russian\npaper mill\nAlthough most messaging associated with hacktivist claims appeared responsive to\ngeopolitical developments, we observed at least one case where the actor opposed domestic\npolicies in the United States. In July 2022, the threat actor \"SiegedSec\" targeted U.S.-based\n\n\n-----\n\nIP addresses with exposed ICS ports to protest abortion restrictions in the United States. The\nattack was part of a broader Anonymous-related hacktivism campaign known as Operation\nJane (aka #OpJane).\n\n### Some Hacktivists Leverage Known OT Exploits to Target Victims Assets\n\nRecently, we have observed hacktivist groups leveraging specialized exploits and exploit\nmodules to increase the likelihood of impacting OT devices. Such evolution in hacktivist\ntechniques results both from the existence of an active community sharing knowledge, and\nthe increasing availability of resources shared publicly to interact with OT.\n\nFor example, in June and July 2022, actors \"GhostSec\" and \"SiegedSec\" targeted OT assets\nin the U.S., Israel, and Russia using OT-oriented exploit modules. The actors leveraged an\nIEC-104 and EtherNet-IP CIP Metasploit modules, and a custom Modbus-based tool dubbed\n\"Killbus\" (Figure 3).\n\nFigure 3: EtherNet/IP CIP Metasploit module commands executed by hacktivists\nIn other cases, actors exploited known vulnerabilities to reach their target. For example, in\nJune 2022, pro-Ukraine threat actor Team OneFist targeted a cellular router allegedly\nsupporting OT in Russia by exploiting a known cross-site request forgery (CSRF)\nvulnerability in the system that leads to remote code execution.\n\n\n-----\n\nBetween April and July 2022, multiple hacktivist groups targeted ELNet OT assets in Israel,\npossibly by exploiting a missing authentication vulnerability reported in the assets' web\nconsoles. We have not identified evidence indicating formal collaboration between these\nactors, but it is possible that mutual awareness of each other’s activity prompted interest in\nreusing similar vulnerabilities to target their victims.\n\n### Hacktivists Share Documentation of Physical Incidents to Gain Credibility\n\nIn most of the hacktivist claims we tracked, the actors leveraged documentation, such as\nvideos or screenshots, to provide evidence of their actions and gain credibility. Often, the\nactors shared images of real physical incidents to claim responsibility for the destruction of\nassets – even if they were not caused by their attacks. This is likely a strategy used by actors\nto help bring attention to their political and social messaging.\n\nFor example, in July 2022, Iraqi group Altahrea Team claimed it was responsible for a fire at\nthe Orot Yosef power plant in the Negev in southern Israel. The actor shared a video of the\nfire to illustrate their claim (Figure 4). A couple days later, GhostSec shared a video of a\nphysical incident at a hydro-power plant in Russia and claimed credit for the incident. The\nactor noted their recent activity targeting internet-accessible electricity assets in Russia as\nproof of their claims. In both cases, we found no evidence connecting the hacktivist actions\nto the physical incidents.\n\nFigure 4: Video of a physical incident shared by hacktivists to claim authorship\n\n\n-----\n\nIn June 2022, Team OneFist claimed to have disabled a cellular router supporting OT in\nRussia. The actor took advantage of a publicly reported physical incident at a nearby power\nplant and claimed that it was the result of their operation. However, the primary cause of the\noutage was reportedly a fire at a different power plant situated nearly 400 miles away.\n\nThis trend illustrates a common challenge for OT security professionals, which is the limited\nunderstanding of the field outside of specialized industry cliques and the lengthy process\nrequired to conduct root-cause analysis. As we observe an increasing number of claims from\nactors taking responsibility for physical damage, OT defenders require more resources to\nfilter what information is relevant. Additionally, other information operations actors could\npotentially leverage such claims to further their own objectives in targeting a given\npopulation.\n\n### Some Actors Emphasize Intent to Avoid Impacts to or Endanger Human Safety\n\nSome hacktivist actors have also claimed to avoid impacts to human safety. However, there\nis no evidence to verify their intentions. It is plausible that the hacktivists emphasized safety\neither because of the perception of OT-oriented attacks as potentially harmful or simply to\nimprove their reputation and gain sympathy from their audiences.\n\nOne example was the case of GhostSec in July 2022, which claimed to cause an incident at\na power plant in Russia. The actor then claimed the attack was \"executed with 0 casualties in\nthe actual explosion due to our proper timing while performing our attacks\" (Figure 5).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5: Hacktivists emphasizing\n\ntheir alleged cyber-physical attack avoided human casualties\nAnother example is the self-proclaimed hacktivist Predatory Sparrow–also known as\nUNC4368–which in June 2022, claimed to conduct cyber attacks against three steel\nmanufacturers in Iran, alleging it destroyed physical infrastructure. The actor shared a video\nshowing an explosion in a manufacturing facility and emphasized the attack was carried out\ncarefully to protect innocent individuals. We note that the techniques used by Predatory\nSparrow in prior incidents are more complex than those from other hacktivists. This may\nindicate collaboration or sponsorship from sophisticated actors.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6: Screenshot from video uploaded by Predatory Sparrow to provide evidence of the\nattack\nWhile less common, we have also observed self-proclaimed hacktivists claiming direct intent\nto endanger human safety. On Jan. 29, 2023, Arabic-speaking hacktivist group `Force\nElectronic Quds` (FEQ) claimed several attacks against OT in Israel. In a post from one of\nthose attacks, the actor shared screenshots from systems that allegedly belonged to\nchemical facilities. The post threatened the company’s employees and stated they “will never\nhesitate to melt your bodies with chemicals”.\n\n## Hacktivists Target OT to Make Political Statements\n\nHacktivism leverages cyber threat activity as a means to convey political or social narratives.\nAs such, any attempts to inflict damage on a victim may only be a means to this end or one\nof multiple objectives. Historical hacktivist activity has largely focused on simpler attacks that\nare intended to get the attention of broad audiences, such as website compromises or denial\nof service attacks. The shift in hacktivist activity to also target OT can be explained by\nmultiple factors:\n\nAttacks against OT systems are often perceived as impactful, given their potential to\ndamage or modify physical processes. Prioritizing higher-profile targets increases the\nlikelihood that an actor will attract the public’s attention even if they do not damage OT\nsystems or if their compromise results in trivial impacts. Similarly to information\noperations campaigns, these types of hacktivist claims can also serve to undermine the\npublic’s trust in governments and organizations.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn some cases, targeting OT systems enables actors to participate and offer support for\na cause from distant locations, such as during armed conflicts. This is illustrated by\nself-proclaimed hacktivist groups that currently conduct cyber operations in opposition\nor in favor of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\nSelf-proclaimed hacktivist cyber operations have also been used in the past to conceal\nstate-sponsored activity and provide nation-states with plausible deniability—enabling\nstates to conduct attacks with a lower risk of repercussions. An example is XakNet\nTeam, which Mandiant has assessed with moderate confidence to be operating in\n[coordination with APT28 actors. Given that hacktivist claims are often difficult to verify,](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/apt28-a-window-into-russias-cyber-espionage-operations)\nnation-states can also use them to conduct false-flag operations.\nSome hacktivist actors have likely been inspired by prior cyber threat activity related to\nboth [low sophistication compromises and high-impact OT-oriented threat activity.](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/increasing-low-sophistication-operational-technology-compromises)\n\n## Situational Awareness to Prevent Hacktivist Compromises\n\nIn 2022, Mandiant observed a significant increase in the number of instances where\nhacktivists claimed to target OT. While we observed activity across different regions, most of\nthese cases were conducted by actors that have mobilized surrounding the Russian invasion\nof Ukraine. The implication of this is that the increase in hacktivism activity targeting OT may\nnot necessarily become consistent over time. However, it does illustrate that during political,\nmilitary, or social events, OT defenders face a heightened risk.\n\nThese risks are also exacerbated by the quick evolution of hacktivist actors that have\nexperimented with new tools and exploits during the war in Ukraine. The information and\nknowledge about OT compromises, which has been produced and shared during the last\nyear, will likely help reduce the learning curve for different actors interested in targeting OT.\nThis may increase the complexity of low sophistication compromises even after the end of\nthe war. It is also possible that other more sophisticated actors will copy hacktivist techniques\nto limit the risk of facing consequences when targeting OT, or to support other types of\ninformation operations.\n\nAsset owners and operators should maintain situational awareness of trends in hacktivist\nthreat activity targeting OT systems to anticipate potential risks. We also highlight that most\noften, hacktivist threat activity can be prevented following common best practices for remote\naccess to critical and internet-accessible systems.\n\nMandiant Threat Intelligence customers have access to the full list of incidents referred to in\nthis blog post.
