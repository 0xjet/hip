This is not the first time we have seen\nan active Webex campaign, however, as [we have noted before. It is actually an attack](https://cofense.com/new-phishing-campaign-spoofs-webex-target-remote-workers/)\nmethod that became increasingly common as non-essential workers were pushed into\nremote working conditions due to the pandemic. The previous Webex phish utilized\n\n\n-----\n\nimplications of vulnerabilities and SSL certificate fixes for Webex, but this one takes a more\nsubtle approach: acting as a Webex event invite.\n\n_Figure 1: Email Body_\n\nThe email shown in Figure 1 looks like a relatively normal Webex event invite at a glance.\nThis email is a simple Webex invite that anyone who uses Webex may be accustomed to.\nThis invite says that the user has been invited to the event “Leadership&Muscles,” the host is\n“Online Leader” and, although it is vague, the mentions of “Leadership” and “Online Leader”\n\n\n-----\n\nmay have most users determine this has to do with work and – without typical phishing\nlanguage urging them to join – many may not feel so threatened; they may opt to join the\nmeeting out of curiosity.\n\nAnd should a user think to hover-check the button to “join a meeting,” the URL that will show\nas a preview will be: hxxp://idbrokerwebex[.]com\n\nDespite the threat actor’s attempts to make this email seem legitimate, however, the subject\nof the email already appears off compared to what is seen in the body – a Portuguese\nsubject paired with an English body? If that does not reveal the true nature of this email then\nthe threat actor’s carelessness with the From and Sender fields will. Although it is obvious\nthere was an attempt to make the email appear as though it is coming from Webex with the\n[inclusion of “[email protected],” the real sender email is next to it:](https://cofense.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)\namericacentral02[@]eliteddi[.]com.\n\nLooking into the domain eliteddi.com, we can see that it was recently registered, as seen in\nFigure 2.\n\n_Figure 2: Domain Registration Information for eliteddi.com_\n\nThis was perhaps done in a bid to give themselves a domain to use for sending emails.\nWhen utilizing their own registered domains, this gives the threat actor a legitimate DKIM,\nSPF and DMARC to bypass resources. This domain was presumably also used as practice\nin setting up this attack because, as noted in Figure 3, the domain is also the host to the\n\n\n-----\n\nsame Webex phish. Because the domain eliteddi[.]com is not part of the actual email itself,\nand isn’t actually a part that a user would typically interact with, it can be assumed that this\ndomain was part of the threat actor’s practice attempt before launching this attack.\n\n_Figure 3: Webex phish found on the sender domain eliteddi[.]com_\n\nTaking a look at the URL found embedded into the email itself we can see that this URL\nlooks much more legitimate than the one seen in the threat actor’s practice attempts. This\nfraudulent domain was also recently registered according to information found on its\ncorresponding WhoIs record, as seen in Figure 4.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4: Domain information for idbrokerwebex[.]com_\n\nOne thing to note for this fraudulent domain is that the threat actor has tried to mimic a\nreal Webex URL, one that is typically just a quick redirect when logging into Webex Teams,\nbut would still be a familiar site to users. The small difference between the legitimate and the\nphishing URLs, though, is a simple “.” separating idbroker from webex – a small mistaken\nmistype of a user trying to get to this domain can lead to a huge mistake in this case.\n\nThe phish itself can be noted in Figure 2.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5-6: Phishing Page_\n\nThe Webex phish similar to this has utilized the same template when phishing for\ncredentials, essentially a perfect copy of Webex’s login page. This page does not have any\nnoticeable flaws in grammar anywhere or weird formatting. In fact, even the URL in the\naddress bar does not give anything away immediately should a user glance at it for any sort\nof validation.\n\n\n-----\n\nCompared to the phishing page seen hosted on the threat actor s practice domain noted\nabove, this one actually has a certificate for the site that, in turn, adds a lock in the address\nbar which, to most, indicates that a site is “secure.” This is a relatively common addition,\nespecially with the use of website builders that give creators a certificate to work\nwith. However, as noted numerous times in other blogs, threat actors are using\nthat perception to trick users into trusting their phishing attacks.\n\nThe second step of this attack can be noted in Figures 7-8. This step acts more as a\ndistraction mechanism, as the page looks like any other Webex event registration page. Here\nthe user would input any amount of information as long as the fields are required, then move\non to the final confirmation page. While this page is more than likely just an attempt to put\nany suspicions the user had initially to rest, this page also has the potential to garner more\ninformation about the user.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7-8: “Event” Registration_\n\n**Indicators of Compromise**\n\nNetwork IOC IP\n\nhxxp://eliteddi[.]com 192.185.214.103\n\nhxxp://idbrokerwebex[.]com 216.172.161.34\n\n**All third-party trademarks referenced by Cofense whether in logo form, name form or product form,**\n**or otherwise, remain the property of their respective holders, and use of these trademarks in no**\n**way indicates any relationship between Cofense and the holders of the trademarks.
