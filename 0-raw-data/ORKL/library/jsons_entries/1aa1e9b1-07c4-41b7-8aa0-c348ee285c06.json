The majority of targets were NATO-aligned nation states, although several\nformer USSR nation states were also targeted. The attacks primarily deployed variants of the\n[Zebrocy tool, which we have previously analyzed. A smaller subset of the delivery](https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/2018/06/unit42-sofacy-groups-parallel-attacks/)\n[documents delivered Cannon or a Zebrocy Delphi variant as reported by ESET. Since we](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/11/20/sednit-whats-going-zebrocy/)\nbegan tracking the use of Zebrocy going back to mid-2015, we have observed a significant\nincrease in frequency of deployment of this tool. Compared to other backdoor tools\nassociated with the Sofacy group, the use of Zebrocy in attack campaigns is far more\nwidespread.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe cluster of activity we detail in this blog revolves primarily around a common author name\nused in each of the delivery documents: Joohn. Our initial sample of interest was the delivery\ndocument using the crash list(Lion Air Boeing 737).docx filename, which delivered the\nZebrocy tool. By leveraging our AutoFocus threat intelligence platform in conjunction with\n[data collected from VirusTotal, we were able to pivot from artifacts discovered in the](https://www.virustotal.com/)\nmetadata and behaviors to discover the Cannon tool, as well as a number of additional\ndelivery documents, payloads, and targets. The attack vector for all of these attacks appears\nto be via spear-phishing, using email accounts registered to legitimate email providers\ninstead of spoofed email addresses or previously compromised accounts. The account\nnames visually look similar to legitimate government organization names or other trusted\nthird-party entities. The delivery documents were functionally all the similar, using the remote\ntemplate function in Microsoft Word to retrieve a malicious macro from the first stage C2 and\nultimately loading and executing an initial payload. The majority of delivery documents\ncontain a generic lure image requesting the victim enable macros with no additional content,\nthe adversaries seemingly relying solely on lure filenames to entice victims to launch the\nmalicious document.\n\nIn all, we intercepted nine weaponized documents spanning from October 17, 2018 through\nNovember 15, 2018 all sharing the same Joohn author name and delivering variants of either\nZebrocy or Cannon. The target radius of our dataset spans four continents, covering\ngovernment agencies at the federal level all the way to local government agencies. We also\nconducted timeline analysis using the collected data which allowed us to discover how the\nSofacy group timed their attacks in the Dear Joohn campaign and also how they may have\ncrafted their attacks using automated tools.\n\nAttack Details\n\nBeginning on October 17, 2018, we collected a total of nine delivery documents sent to a\nmultitude of organizations around the world. The targets included a foreign affairs\norganization in North America, foreign affairs organizations in Europe, as well as government\nentities in former USSR states. We also discovered evidence of possible targeting of local\nlaw enforcement agencies around the world, covering North America, Australia, and Europe.\nOur telemetry also showed possible targeting of NGOs, marketing firms, as well as\norganizations in the medical industry. The attack vector of these attacks was all via spearphishing, using email accounts registered to the free email provider Seznam, a popular web\nservices provider located in the Czech Republic. An example can be seen in Figure 1.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1 Example spear-phishing email delivered in Dear Joohn attacks_\n\nIn this campaign, the Sofacy group appears to have relied heavily on filenames to lure\nvictims into launching the weaponized documents. Filenames ranged from topics alluding to\nBrexit, the Lion Air crash, and recent rocket attacks in Israel. The full list of filenames we\nwere able to collect can be seen in Table 1. Although the filenames appeared to be highly\ntargeted and pertinent to the victims, the actual lure content of the documents were far more\ngeneric as seen in Figure 2.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2 Generic lure image_\n\nIn November 2018, the adversary shifted tactics and began implementing non-generic lure\ncontent for their weaponized documents. We collected three samples heavily targeting\nNATO-aligned nation states at this time, using three different lures as seen in Figure 3.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3 Targeted lure content_\n\nIn one of the documents, the victim is presented with what appears to be an obfuscated\ndocument with the NATO EOD seal and text alluding to the targeted nation state. Unpacking\nthe document revealed that the unobfuscated image was a screenshot of a cover page\nregarding a NATO workshop in the targeted nation state. The other two documents had very\nsimilar lures to each other, presenting garbled text to the target with instructions for the victim\non how to properly view the document. Interestingly, one of them contained instructions in\nRussian, which may indicate the intended target was a Russian speaking nation-state.\n\n\n-----\n\nEach of these weaponized documents used the same tactic for their attacks. Upon opening\nthe document, it leveraged the ability of Microsoft Word to retrieve a remote template to then\nload a malicious macro document as seen in Figure 4.\n\n_Figure 4 Microsoft Word attempting to download the remote template_\n\nIf the C2 server is active at the time the document is opened, it will successfully retrieve the\nmalicious macro and load it in the same Microsoft Word session. The victim will then see a\nprompt to Enable Content as with any malicious macro document as seen in Figure 5. If the\nC2 server is not active at this time, the download will fail and the victim will not receive a\nprompt to Enable Content as no macro is downloaded.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5 Remote template document requesting the user to click \"Enable Content\" to run_\n_macro_\n\nClustering\n\nThe delivery documents used in the October and November waves shared a large number of\nsimilarities, as seen in Table 1, which allowed us to cluster the activity together. Most notably,\nthe author name Joohn was used repeatedly in each delivery document. There was a slight\ndeviation in the November grouping, where the three samples we collected still used the\nJoohn author name for the last modified field but reverted to a default USER/user author\nname for the creator field.\n\n\n**Hash** **Filename** **Created**\n**By**\n\n\n**Last**\n**Modified**\n**By**\n\n\n**Remote**\n**Template**\n**Location**\n\n\n**R**\n**T**\n**H**\n\n\nc20e5d56b3.. 1500029.docx Joohn Joohn 185.203.118[.]198 8\n\nabfc14f7f7..

All C2s used in the Dear Joohn campaign were IPbased and examining the infrastructure did not provide significant overlap or relationships\nwith previous Zebrocy or Sofacy infrastructure. A visual representation of the Dear Joohn\ncampaign can be seen in Figure 6.\n\n_Figure 6 Relational diagram of artifacts_\n\n\n-----\n\nWe created a timeline of the activity based off the data we collected, and found that the\nattack dates were tightly clustered into two waves in mid- to late-October and in midNovember as we see in Figure 7 using the timestamps from Table 3.\n\n\n**Filename** **Created**\n**On**\n\n\n**First**\n**Seen**\n\n10/18/18\n07:38\n\n10/25/18\n08:15\n\n11/01/18\n06:50\n\n11/01/18\n11:41\n\n10/18/18\n08:47\n\n10/24/18\n07:38\n\n11/14/18\n05:14\n\n11/15/18\n06:28\n\n11/15/18\n12:31\n\n\n**Total Time**\n**(In Days)**\n\n37.1\n\n44.12\n\n51.1\n\n51.3\n\n0.4\n\n6.2\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n\nPassport.docx\ninstruction.docx\n\n\n9/11/18\n04:22\n\n\nDN_325_170428_DEA...invitation.docx 9/11/18\n04:22\n\n\ncrash list(Lion Air Boeing 737).docx\nБурханов.docx\n\n\n9/11/18\n04:22\n\n\nЗаявление.docx 9/11/18\n04:22\n\n1500029.docx 10/18/18\n06:59\n\n2018_10_13_17_15_21.docx 10/18/18\n06:59\n\nRocket attacks on Israel.docx 11/13/18\n12:17\n\n\nBrexit 15.11.2018.docx\nDIP 89 OIC Condemns 14 Nov\nAttacks.docx\n15.11 attacks.docx\n\n\n11/14/18\n14:17\n\n\n**Last**\n**Modified**\n\n10/13/18\n08:21\n\n10/13/18\n08:21\n\n10/13/18\n08:21\n\n10/13/18\n08:21\n\n10/18/18\n07:00\n\n10/18/18\n07:00\n\n11/13/18\n10:46\n\n11/15/18\n04:50\n\n11/15/18\n04:50\n\n\n201811131257.docx 11/14/18\n14:33\n\n\n_Table 3 Timestamps of delivery documents (all times in UTC)_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7 Dear Joohn timeline_\n\nBased off the timestamps we have, four delivery documents were initially created on\nSeptember 11, 2018 04:22 UTC. These four were then all modified on the same date and\ntime on October 13, 2018 08:21. Having three different C2 locations embedded inside these\ndelivery documents while maintaining the exact same timestamping may indicate the use of\nan automated tool. Using a command line based penetration testing toolkit such as Phishery\ncould allow for simple scripting to generate multiple documents all at the same time with\ndifferent inputs. From there, there was an average of a two-week gap until these documents\nwere first seen in the wild. In total, these four documents had an average of roughly 46 days\nfrom initial creation to attack. Based on the modular nature of the Dear Joohn campaign\nattacks, the lengthy amount of time from initial creation to attack may suggest the campaign\nwas not yet ready for deployment due to additional development required for the remote\ntemplates, payloads, or infrastructure. Another possible scenario is that the adversary may\nhave had a certain timeframe they desired to execute the attack, and from the timeline it is\nclear there were two distinct targeting time frames, one from mid to late October 2018 and\nthe other in mid-November 2018. As the campaign progressed, the operational tempo of the\nDear Joohn campaign increased, with the total time from document creation to first seen\ndropping down to an average of roughly two days.\n\nWhen comparing the provided timestamps of the delivery documents to the timestamps for\nthe remote template documents from Table 2, we find that the time to attack is directly\ncorrelated to the last time the templates are modified. On average, there was a 13.8 hour\ngap between when the template document was last touched by the operator and when the\ndelivery document is first observed in the wild. This leads us to believe that the generation of\nthe delivery documents were indeed part of a staging effort, first with the initial creation of the\ndocument, modification to it to communicate with a C2, then generating a remote template\ndocument just prior to launching the actual attack.\n\n\n-----\n\nAnalysis using timestamps is not always conclusive however. One of the documents we\nexamined with the filename Rocket attacks on Israel.docx (SHA256: 34bdb5b364..)\ncontained inconsistent creation and last modified timestamps, with the last modified\ntimestamp occurring before the creation timestamp. A possible explanation for this is that the\ndocument was copied to another system with an incorrectly set system time, then saved with\nthe incorrect time. This document was also the first of the mid-November cluster which used\nthe user/USER author name instead of Joohn, further supporting the scenario of the\ndocument being copied between systems.\n\nThe Payloads\n\nThe delivery documents in this attack campaign loaded remote templates whose macros\ninstalled a variety of first-stage payloads. With the notable exception of the Cannon tool, the\nfirst-stage tools are all variants of the Zebrocy Trojan. The Zebrocy variants delivered in this\ncampaign were written in several different languages, including Delphi, C# and VB.NET.\nInformation on the first-stage payloads delivered in this attack are listed in Table 4.\n\n**SHA256** **Compiled** **Variant** **C2**\n\n5173721f30.. 10/23/18 C# Zebrocy 145.249.105[.]165\n\n61a1f3b4fb.. 11/1/18 C# Cannon sahro.bella7[at]post.cz\n\n6ad3eb8b56.. 6/19/92 Delphi Zebrocy 188.241.58[.]170\n\n9a0f00469d.. 10/25/18 C# Zebrocy 145.249.105[.]165\n\nb41480d685.. 6/19/92 Delphi Zebrocy 109.248.148[.]42\n\nc91843a69d.. 6/19/92 Delphi Zebrocy 185.203.118[.]198\n\ne5aece694d.. 11/13/18 VB.NET Zebrocy 109.248.148[.]42\n\n_Table 4 Payloads delivered in related attacks_\n\nThe Delphi variant of Zebrocy delivered in this attack campaign are very similar to the Delphi\n[downloader discussed in our previous Zebrocy research published in June 2018. While this](https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/2018/06/unit42-sofacy-groups-parallel-attacks/)\nDelphi variant was known, the C# and VB.NET variants delivered in this attack campaign\nwere previously unknown. An interesting note on these payloads is that all the Delphi\npayloads delivered in this campaign were packed with UPX, while none of the other payloads\nwere packed. While we can only speculate on the specific reason, it is likely Sofacy packed\nonly the Delphi variants in an attempt to increase evasion as the Delphi variant of Zebrocy is\nknown and has been widely analyzed.\n\n\n-----\n\nBy collecting and analyzing additional Cannon samples, we believe we have also found a\nCannon variant written in Delphi. We have seen Sofacy using multiple languages to create\nvariants of the Zebrocy Trojan, so it seems fitting that the group would create additional\nvariants of Cannon in multiple programming languages as well.\n\nC# Cannon\n\nSince our [initial blog that introduced the Cannon tool, we were able to collect more samples](https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/2018/11/unit42-sofacy-continues-global-attacks-wheels-new-cannon-trojan/)\nof Cannon to get a better understanding of its origins. It appears that the first known sample\nof Cannon was created on April 18, 2018 and since then there has been at least seven\nadditional samples. Table 5 shows the known Cannon samples, their compilation time and\nthe email accounts used for its C2 communications.\n\n**SHA256** **Compiled** **C2 account** **POP3S Account** **SMTPS Accounts**\n\n861b6bc1f9.. 4/18/18 sym777.g kae.mezhnosh vebek.morozh30\ng0r7tsa45s\n\nmarvel.polezha\n\n4405cfbf28.. 5/14/18 sym777.g kae.mezhnosh vebek.morozh30\ng0r7tsa45s\n\nmarvel.polezha\n\n174effcdee.. 6/15/18 sym777.g kae.mezhnosh vebek.morozh30\ng0r7tsa45s\n\nmarvel.polezha\n\na23261e2b6.. 6/22/18 sym777.g kae.mezhnosh vebek.morozh30\ng0r7tsa45s\n\nmarvel.polezha\n\n651d5aab82.. 10/19/18 sym777.g kae.mezhnosh vebek.morozh30\ng0r7tsa45s\n\nmarvel.polezha\n\n68df0f924c.. 10/22/18 sym777.g kae.mezhnosh vebek.morozh30\ng0r7tsa45s\n\nmarvel.polezha\n\n\n-----\n\n61a1f3b4fb.. 11/1/18 sahro.bella7 trala.cosh2 Bishtr.cam47\nLobrek.chizh\n\nCervot.woprov\n\n_Table 5 Gathered C# Cannon samples_\n\nAs mentioned in our initial blog, the actor controlled email address acting as the C2 was\nsahro.bella7[at]post.cz, but all previous samples of Cannon used sym777.g[at]post.cz. Also,\nall previous samples of Cannon used an account name of kae.mezhnosh to receive emails\nfrom the actor, while using the accounts vebek.morozh30, g0r7tsa45s and marvel.polezha to\n_send emails to the actor._\n\nAs we reported in our previous analysis of Cannon, the tool logs into an email account using\nPOP3S and checks for emails with a specific filename that it will save to the system and\nexecute. The initial sample we analyzed looked for an attachment with a filename of\nauddevc.txt, but other Cannon samples have looked for the following filenames instead:\n\nDelphi Cannon\n\nWhile searching for additional Cannon samples, we discovered another tool that used emails\nfor its C2 communications. The initial overlap was based on the filename wmssl.exe, which\nwas seen as an executable name that Cannon would move the wmssl.txt attachment to\ninstall and execute a secondary payload. Initial analysis indicated this may have been a\ntenuous connection; however, after we gathered additional samples of Delphi Cannon, we\ndiscovered additional relationships. Table 6 shows Delphi Cannon samples we gathered,\nincluding the sample 215f7c08c2.. that is very similar to the Trojan discussed in ESET’s\nresearch.\n\n**SHA256** **Compiled** **C2 email** **POP3S Account**\n\n5a02d4e5f6.. 1/23/18 heatlth500@ambcomission[.]com trash023@ambcomission[.]\n\nd06be83a40.. 2/21/18 heatlth500@ambcomission[.]com trash023@ambcomission[.]\n\n78adc8e5e4.. 2/28/18 heatlth500@ambcomission[.]com trash023@ambcomission[.]\n\n054c5aa73d.. 3/3/18 heatlth500@ambcomission[.]com trash023@ambcomission[.]\n\ncac630c11c.. 4/18/18 N/A N/A\n\n\n-----\n\necc5805898.. 5/4/18 heatlth500@ambcomission[.]com trash023@ambcomission[.]\n\n215f7c08c2.. 6/14/18 rishit333@ambcomission[.]com tomasso25@ambcomission\n\n_Table 6 Gathered Delphi Cannon Samples_\n\nThe compilation times in Table 6 suggests that the Delphi variant of Cannon predates the\noriginally reported version, as the first known Delphi sample was compiled in January 2018\nand the first known Cannon sample was compiled in April 2018. The Delphi variant of\nCannon does not use legitimate web-based email services for its C2 communications,\ninstead opting to use email accounts at an actor owned domain, ambcomission[.]com. This\n[actor controlled domain links to a larger Sofacy infrastructure as reported by ThreatConnect.](https://threatconnect.com/blog/finding-nemohost-fancy-bear-infrastructure/)\nEven though Delphi Cannon uses POP3S and SMTPS for its C2 communications like\nCannon, it is arguably easier to defend against as it uses an actor owned domain that\ndefenders can easily block and not a legitimate email provider such as Seznam.\n\nThe oldest known sample of the Delphi variant (SHA256: 5a02d4e5f6…) provided us a much\nstronger linkage between this Delphi Cannon and Cannon, as this sample collects system\ninformation and sends it to the C2 email address, which includes the path of the running\nprocess appended to the string Running place. The screenshot in Figure 8 of the inf method\nwithin a Cannon sample (SHA256: 4405cfbf28...) shows the information gathered that is\nexfiltrated to the C2 via email, specifically with RunningPlace and LogicalDrives header\nstrings:\n\n_Figure 8 inf method used by Cannon_\n\nWhen comparing the two Cannon variants, we found a method within a Delphi Cannon\nsample (SHA256: 5a02d4e5f6...) showing the use of Running place and Logical_Drivers as\nheader strings to the system information it is collecting and sending to the C2 via email.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile not an exact match, Figure 9 shows these similar header strings and strengthens our\nhypothesis that the two variants are indeed related:\n\n_Figure 9 Similarities of Delphi Cannon and Cannon_\n\nAs seen in Table 6, one of the Delphi Cannon samples (SHA256: cac630c11c..) does not\nhave any associated email addresses, as the sample does not seem to have any C2\nfunctionality. Instead, this sample reads “tasks” from a file named ta.bin that another\nunknown tool then must write to and handle C2 functionality. It is also interesting that this\nspecific sample has the same resource name (L30) that contains the same encrypted email\naddresses as the other samples in Table 6 using heatlth500@ambcomission[.]com as a C2\nemail (such as ecc5805898..) but does not contain any code to access the resource or\ndecrypt its contents.\n\nVB.NET Zebrocy Variant\n\nThe VB.NET variant (SHA256: e5aece694d..) is very similar to other known Zebrocy\nvariants. It includes the storage volume serial number within the URL it uses as its C2\nbeacon, which it obtains using the Scripting.FileSystemObject object to call GetDriveName\nfrom the path stored in Environment.SpecialFolder.LocalApplicationData. It then uses the\n\n\n-----\n\nstorage volume obtained from the GetDriveName function and calls GetDrive to get the\nSerialNumber of the storage device. The VB.NET variant then gathers system information\nand running processes like other Zebrocy variants by running the following commands:\n\nsysteminfo & tasklist\n\nThe URL used to send the system information, running processes and a screenshot to the\nC2 server is:\n\nhxxp://109.248.148[.]42/agr-enum/progress-inform/cube.php?res=[serial number]\n\nThe VB.NET variant of Zebrocy uses an HTTP POST request to the URL above to transmit\nthe gathered data, of which is included within the HTTP POST data that is structured as\nfollows (notice the spaces before and after ampersand “&”):\n\ndata=[system information and running processes] & arg=[screenshot in BMP format]\n\nC# Zebrocy Variant\n\nThe C# variant of Zebrocy is similar to other variants in functionality, but also has several\nunique attributes that are worth discussing. Like other Zebrocy tools, the C# variant gathers\nthe storage volume serial number to use in outbound beacons to the C2 server. In this\nparticular variant, the tool uses the Windows API function GetVolumeInformation to get the\nserial number of the C: drive. This variant of Zebrocy also takes a screenshot that it will\ntransmit to the C2 server in JPEG format.\n\nThe most notable change to this variant of Zebrocy, other than the programming language\nused, is the way the tool gathers the system information and running processes. Instead of\nusing systeminfo and tasklist commands, the C# variant of Zebrocy uses WMI queries to\ngather this information. The tool runs the following list of WMI queries:\n\nwmic logicaldisk get Caption, Description,VolumeSerialNumber,Size,FreeSpace\nwmic diskdrive get Model, SerialNumber\nwmic computersystem get Manufacturer, Model, Name, SystemTypec\nwmic os get Caption, OSArchitecture, OSLanguage,SystemDrive,MUILanguages\nwmic process get Caption,ExecutablePath\n\nThe URL used to send the system information, running processes and a screenshot to the\nC2 server is:\n\nhxxp://145.249.105[.]165/resource-store/stockroom-center-service/check.php?fm=[serial\nnumber]\n\nThe C# variant of Zebrocy uses an HTTP POST request to the URL above to transmit the\ngathered data, of which is included within the HTTP POST data that is structured as follows:\n\n\n-----\n\nspp=[system information from WMI queries] &spvg=[screenshot in JPEG format]\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Sofacy group continues their attacks on organizations across the globe using similar\ntactics and techniques. We observed them carrying out attacks via spear-phishing emails in\nlate October through November, often leveraging current events within filenames to entice\nrecipients to open the malicious attachments. The group clearly shows a preference for using\na simple downloader like Zebrocy as first-stage payloads in these attacks. The group\ncontinues to develop new variations of Zebrocy by adding a VB.NET and C# version, and it\nappears that they also have used different variants of the Cannon tool in past attack\ncampaigns.\n\nPalo Alto Networks customers are protected by attacks discussed in this blog by:\n\nAll delivery documents and payloads discussed are detected with malicious verdicts
