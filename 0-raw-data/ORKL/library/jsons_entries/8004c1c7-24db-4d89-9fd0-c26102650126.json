Packing up her_\n_bag, she goes to turn off her computer monitor and no-_\n_tices an update waiting patiently on her screen: “Flash_\n_Player might be out-of-date. The version of_\n_this plug-in on your computer might not_\n_include the latest security updates.” Liv_\n_clicks ‘Yes’ to begin the update and_\n_hurriedly steps out of her cubicle._\n_As she moves quietly down the_\n_fall, her laptop fan whirs as it_\n_visits specific URLs before_\n_downloading a file called_\n_“install_flash_player.exe,”_\n_and, covertly, the Trojan._\n_Karagany.B backdoor._\n\n_Liv has no reason to sus-_\n_pect that this software up-_\n_date is different from any_\n_other but it allows attackers_\n_to quickly install additional_\n_tools on her device. Leveraging_\n_passwords and usernames stolen_\n_through an earlier phishing campaign_\n_against Liv’s firm, the intruders move_\n_quickly across the entire company’s network_\n_and proceed to take screenshots of sensitive windows_\n_and capture images of the company’s grid operation_\n_control panels. What might have seemed like a harmless_\n_software update is actually part of a multiphase cam-_\n_paign that could have allowed attackers to stop the flow_\n\n\n_of electricity to thousands of businesses and homes in_\n_the United States._\n\n_This malware isn’t fictional. From 2015 to 2017, an extensive_\n_[campaign called Dragonfly 2.0 saw “Trojanized” software](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/dragonfly-energy-sector-cyber-attacks)_\n_updates alongside phishing emails and watering hole_\n_attacks used to gain access to the networks of_\n_more than twenty energy sector firms in_\n_the United States and in Europe.[1] In an_\n_alarming echo of the 2015 attacks_\n_on Ukraine’s energy grid, the at-_\n_tackers obtained_ _[operational](https://www.wired.com/story/hackers-gain-switch-flipping-access-to-us-power-systems/)_\n_[control of several firms’ net-](https://www.wired.com/story/hackers-gain-switch-flipping-access-to-us-power-systems/)_\n_works, giving them the capa-_\n_bility to sabotage the energy_\n_access of thousands of US_\n_users.[2] Using compromised_\n_third-party software, attack-_\n_ers gained a_ _[foothold in](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/pan9wn/hackers-hijacked-asus-software-updates-to-install-backdoors-on-thousands-of-computers)_\n_operating systems over the_\n_course of the campaign.[3]_\n\n_Liv wasn’t being careless. Up-_\n_dating software regularly is con-_\n_sidered best practice. Yet imper-_\n_sonating updates by trusted third-_\n_party vendors provided the DragonFly_\n_attackers access to major firms in the en-_\n_ergy sector. The software supply chain presents_\n_a significant source of risk for organizations from critical_\n_infrastructure companies to government security agencies_\n_but the state of security in this supply chain doesn’t match_\n_up to the risk. There are opportunities for the policy commu-_\n_nity and industry to work together to address the problem._\n\n\n1 Broadcom, “Dragonfly: Western Energy Sector Targeted by Sophisticated Attack Group,” Symantec Enterprise Blogs/Threat Intelligence, October 20,\n[2017, https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/dragonfly-energy-sector-cyber-attacks.](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/dragonfly-energy-sector-cyber-attacks)\n2 [Andy Greenburg, “Hackers Gain Direct Access to US Power Grid Controls,” WIRED, September 6, 2017, https://www.wired.com/story/hackers-gain-switch-](https://www.wired.com/story/hackers-gain-switch-flipping-access-to-us-power-systems/)\n[flipping-access-to-us-power-systems/.](https://www.wired.com/story/hackers-gain-switch-flipping-access-to-us-power-systems/)\n3 [Kim Zetter, “Hackers Hijacked ASUS Software Updates to Install Backdoors on Thousands of Computers,” VICE, March 25, 2019, https://www.vice.com/](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/pan9wn/hackers-hijacked-asus-software-updates-to-install-backdoors-on-thousands-of-computers)\n[en_us/article/pan9wn/hackers-hijacked-asus-software-updates-to-install-backdoors-on-thousands-of-computers.](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/pan9wn/hackers-hijacked-asus-software-updates-to-install-backdoors-on-thousands-of-computers)\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Executive Summary\n\nociety has a software problem. Since Ada Lovelace\ndeployed the first computer program on an early\nmechanical device in the 1840s, software has\nspread to every corner of human experience. Our\n\n# Swatches now have Internet connections, combat aircraft\n\ncome with more code than computer operating systems,\nand every organization from the Internal Revenue Service to\nan Etsy storefront relies on software to serve their customers. No longer confined merely to computers, embedded\nsoftware now controls the operation of complex power generators, medical hardware, the behavior of automotive brake\npedals, and planetary scale datasets. As one commentator\n[put it, “software is eating the world.”[4]](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460)\n\nWith software come security flaws and a long tail of updates\nfrom vendors and maintainers. Unlike a physical system that\nis little modified once it has left the factory, software is subject to continual revision through updates and patches. This\nmakes the supply for code long and subject to myriad flaws,\nboth unintentional and malicious. The private sector’s aggregated risk from software supply chain compromises continues to grow. Ever more feature-rich software is finding its way\ninto a widening array of consumer products and enterprise\nservices, enlarging the potential attack surface. Organizations\nincreasingly outsource IT management and services to cloud\ncomputing and managed service providers (MSPs), raising\nthe likelihood that a given firm will be impacted by an attack\ntargeting one of these providers, like the successful penetra[tion of eleven Saudi MSPs in 2018.[5] A similar kind of concen-](https://www.zdnet.com/article/cybersecurity-new-hacking-group-targets-it-companies-in-supply-chain-attack-campaign/)\ntration is present in software development where firms can\nbuy pre-built code from a third parties for complex or widely\nencountered tasks. Trek Networks, a US company, builds\nsoftware to allow Internet of things (IoT) devices to communi[cate over the Internet. In 2020, it was informed of nineteen](https://www.jsof-tech.com/ripple20/)\n[critical vulnerabilities in its products.[6] These vulnerabilities in](https://www.jsof-tech.com/ripple20/)\none company’s software impacted products from nearly a\ndozen other manufacturers, like Intel and Caterpillar, potentially affecting hundreds of millions of devices.\n\nThe public sector, particularly defense organizations, assumes even greater risk. A generation of Western defense\n\n\nsystems, led by those in the United States, benefit from the\nadvantages of Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) procurement. Under a COTS model, defense organizations look\nto buy and repurpose or build from available commercial\ncomponents to reduce cost, limit technological lag, and\nimprove development speed. For the United States, COTS\nsoftware has underpinned a generation of Department of\nDefense (DoD) systems, leveraging everything from miniaturized low-cost GPS receivers to high-bandwidth satellite data links with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and\ngrowing dependence on open-source software (OSS) in\nlogistics and maintenance systems. A flaw in widely used\nsoftware could undermine the DoD’s ability to interpret and\nwork with large quantities of sensor data. This attack could\n[be innocuous and go undetected for months, like a 2017](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/09/devs-unknowingly-use-malicious-modules-put-into-official-python-repository/)\n[incident in which malicious code was substituted for legiti-](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/09/devs-unknowingly-use-malicious-modules-put-into-official-python-repository/)\nmate samples in the Python Package Manager.[7]\n\nSoftware supply chain security remains an underappreciated domain of national security policymaking. The debate\nover 5G and telecommunications security, for example, has\nfocused largely on hardware manufacturing and deployment, yet it is software in these devices that determines\ndata’s confidentiality and path through the global Internet.\nThe push for open architecture in telecommunications, the\nOpen Radio Access Network (ORAN) model, and industry\ntrends toward network function virtualization mean even\nmore hardware functionality will shift to software—making\nsoftware supply chain security a critical competitive dimension. Exclusive focus on hardware security has resulted in\nmissed opportunities for policy makers. Continued inaction\nto secure software supply chains risks compromising important intelligence, defense, and public policy programs\nand will undermine the long-term innovative potential of\nalready faltering US technology dominance.\n\nSoftware supply chain attacks are popular, they are impactful, and are used to great effect by states, especially China\n[and Russia. High-profile attacks like NotPetya have forced](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/07/heavily-armed-police-raid-company-that-seeded-last-weeks-notpetya-outbreak/)\npolicy makers to confront the importance of software\nsupply chains, but only episodically and without leading\n\n\n4 [Marc Andreessen, “Why Software Is Eating the World,” Wall Street Journal, August 20, 2011, https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB100014240531119034809045](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460)\n[76512250915629460.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460)\n5 [Danny Palmer, “Cybersecurity: New Hacking Group Targets IT Companies in First Stage of Supply Chain Attacks,” ZDNet, September 18, 2019, https://](https://www.zdnet.com/article/cybersecurity-new-hacking-group-targets-it-companies-in-supply-chain-attack-campaign/)\n[www.zdnet.com/article/cybersecurity-new-hacking-group-targets-it-companies-in-supply-chain-attack-campaign/.](https://www.zdnet.com/article/cybersecurity-new-hacking-group-targets-it-companies-in-supply-chain-attack-campaign/)\n6 [Sean Lyngaas, “‘Ripple’ Effect: Flaws Found in Protocols Impact Everything from Printers to Infusion Pumps,” CyberScoop, June 16, 2020, https://www.](https://www.cyberscoop.com/ripple-treck-vulnerabilities-jsof-forescout/)\n[cyberscoop.com/ripple-treck-vulnerabilities-jsof-forescout/.](https://www.cyberscoop.com/ripple-treck-vulnerabilities-jsof-forescout/)\n7 [Dan Goodin, “Devs Unknowingly Use ‘Malicious’ Modules Snuck into Official Python Repository,” Ars Technica, September 16, 2017, https://arstechnica.](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/09/devs-unknowingly-use-malicious-modules-put-into-official-python-repository/)\n[com/information-technology/2017/09/devs-unknowingly-use-malicious-modules-put-into-official-python-repository/.](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/09/devs-unknowingly-use-malicious-modules-put-into-official-python-repository/)\n\n\n-----\n\nto long-term security improvements.[8] Improved technical security measures could raise the cost of attacks, but\nthe United States and its allies must respond to systemic\nthreats and counter the efforts of states to undermine trust\nin software. The cost of these attacks is as much an issue\nfor states in the European Union (EU) and Asia as it is for\nthe United States. This report’s first trend discusses patterns of state attacks against the software supply chain to\nmotivate several recommendations on new alliance models and operational collaboration.\n\nThe security of the software supply chain matters as much\nas the codebase first delivered to a customer but receives\ncomparably less attention and formal treatment in policy\nthan secure development practices or vulnerability discovery. This report evaluates 115 software supply chain\nattacks and vulnerability disclosures collected from public\nreporting covering the past ten years. All of these incidents\nare based on public blogs, write-ups, and media articles\nso do not include private disclosures of attacks which\nnever made it to the public domain. As such, even these\ntrends likely undercount the frequency of attacks on certain high-value targets and are biased away from regions\nthroughout the Global South that receive less focus from\nthe cybersecurity industry. This report identifies five trends\nin software supply chain attacks over the past decade and\noffers three clusters of recommendations to address, mitigate, and counter them. The five trends identified are:\n\n**Deep Impact from State Actors: States have targeted soft-**\nware supply chains with great effect, alone constituting\n\n\nalmost a quarter of this report’s dataset.[9 ]The majority of\ncases surveyed here did, or could have, resulted in remote\ncode execution. We found that states were more likely to\nhijack updates, a comparatively sophisticated distribution\nvector. Several of these cases, like the Dragonfly 2.0 attacks on energy sector targets, are representative of longer campaigns rather than single events. While there are\nexamples from Egyptian, Indian, Iranian, North Korean,\nand Vietnamese actors, Russia and China were far and\naway the most frequent. Examples: CCleaner,[10] NotPetya,[11]\nKingslayer,[12] SimDisk,[13] and ShadowPad.[14]\n\n**Hijacking Updates: These attacks were generally car-**\nried out by states or extremely capable actors. Updates\nthat were signed either by stolen or forged certificates\ncarried malware to targets. The advanced malware often\ncontained components allowing it to spread further from\nthe infected machine either along networks or in hardware. These attacks were more likely to encrypt data,\ntarget physical systems, or extract information, and, generally, were far more sophisticated than app store components. Examples: Flame,[15] Stuxnet,[16] CCleaner 1 and 2,[17]\nNotPetya,[18] Adobe pwdum7v71,[19] Webmin,[20] and PlugX.[21]\n\n**Undermining Code Signing: The technique relies on pub-**\nlic key cryptography and a certificate system to ensure\nthe integrity of updates and the identity of their authors.\nOvercoming its protections is a critical step in any supply chain attack, enabling anything from simple alterations\nof open-source code to complex nation-state espionage\ncampaigns.

The malicious code they spread\nusually stole victims’ data and occasionally tried to target payment information. The actors were usually criminals, and their attacks were generally quickly discovered.\n**Examples: Cdorked/Darkleech,[25] RubyGems Backdoor,[26]**\nHackTask,[27] Colourama,[28] JavaScript 2018 Backdoor,[29] and\n2017 PyPI repository attack.[30]\n\n**App Store Attacks: These attacks used the Google Play**\nStore, Apple’s App Store, and other third-party app distributors to spread malware to mobile devices. Usually, the\napps were designed by attackers to appear legitimate,\nthough some were legitimate apps that they managed to\ncompromise. The malicious apps tended to run adware,\nsteal payment information, and extract data sent to a server\noperated by the attackers. Most perpetrators were criminals, though some state-backed tracking also occurred.\n**Examples: Sandworm’s Android attack,[31] ExpensiveWall,[32]**\nBankBot,[33] Gooligan,[34] and XcodeGhost.[35]\n\nThese trends show software supply chain attacks are\npopular and impactful. They exploit natural seams between organizations and abuse relationships where users\nexpect to find trustworthy code. These attacks are also\nimpactful—targeting the supply chain for code can help\n\n\nmagnify the value of a breach and sow distrust in widely\nused open-source projects. Second, these attacks can\ndrive compromise deep into organization’s technology\nstack, undermining development and administrative tools,\ncode-signing, and device firmware. And, third, software\nsupply chain attacks have strategic utility for state actors\nand have been used to great effect, especially by Russian\nand Chinese groups. This trend is likely to continue and\nshould motivate action from US policy makers.\n\nThe implication for national security policymakers and the\ncybersecurity community across the US and allies is that\nchange is necessary to raise the cost, and lower the impact, of software supply chain attacks. New efforts should\nuse existing security controls and make them accessible\nand low cost for developers. Policymakers should drive\nnew resources and support to open source projects and\nenable better software supply chain security. Civil society\nand the cybersecurity standards community hold great potential to help sustain these changes once initiated, especially for open source. The US and allies need to pursue\nnew approaches to joint activity across the Atlantic and\nPacific to counter state threats and facilitate more effective long-term investigations of criminal actors. Traditional\nalliance structures may be insufficient to address threats\nto major industry players and software supply chains relied\non by intelligence and defense departments and agencies.\n\nThis report offers three clusters of recommendations to\npolicy makers and industry to address the insecurity of the\nsoftware supply chain. **First, improve the baseline.

Perhaps the most useful thing the policy community can do is offer support for widely compatible standards and tools to reduce the burden of secure software\nsupply chain management on developers and project owners. Best practices are not effective in isolation, and\nbelow a certain threshold it is difficult to profile\nwhich vendors and project owners enforce\ngood security practices. The recommendations in this report focus on bringing\nthe best of public and private sector\nsupply chain security tools into the\npublic domain, aligning these tools\nwith widely supported standards,\nand calling out key stakeholders to\nhelp share both how to adopt and\nassess against them.\n\n**Second, better protect open source.**\nOpen-source code forms the basis of\nmost enterprise systems and networks.\nEven large proprietary projects, like the\nWindows operating system, are built on top\nof huge quantities of open-source code. The security of open-source projects, and the apparent ease with\nwhich attackers can introduce insecure code, is a continuing\nconcern. The fluidity with which anyone can commit code to\nan open-source project is at once a core strength and glaring weakness. The policy community must support efforts\nto secure open-source projects, or it will watch a critical and\ninnovative ecosystem wither.\n\n**Third, counter systemic threats. Trust is the critical coin of**\nthe realm and the United States must work with international\npartners to protect against deliberate efforts to undermine\nsoftware supply chains. Efforts by states to impersonate\n\n\nsoftware vendors undermines defender’s ability to patch\nflaws in code and improve the security of software through\nthe entirety of its lifecycle. This lifecycle is critical to sustaining the national security advantages granted by current\nand near-future technologies like sensor fusion networks,\nautonomous supply chains, and “smart” devices. Failure to\nprotect the ability to trust software could cripple the\nbenefits gained from it. These recommendations zero in on systemic threats to trust and\nhighlight new institutional responses from\nthe US and allies to mitigate the activities of states like Russia and China.\nTransoceanic responses are needed\nto protect the software supply chain\nand the US can extend existing\npartnerships to support more effective joint attribution and collaboration with allies.\n\nCompromising the software supply\nchain enables attackers to deliver\nmalicious code in the guise of trusted\nprograms. This can be a terribly effective\ntechnique to spread an attack widely and\nin targeting well-secured systems. These risks\nare particularly acute for the national security community\nwhose ability to churn through huge quantities of surveillance data, run complex weapon systems, and support\nmodern logistics systems is dependent on software, most\nof it developed outside of government. The solution is not\npanic nor is it a moonshot, but rather renewed focus on\nsoftware supply chain security practices, new investment\nfrom public and private sectors, and revisions to public\npolicy that emphasize raising the lowest common denominator of security behavior while countering the most impactful attacks.

Introduction\n\nhe state of security in the software supply chain is\ninadequate and, in some critical respects, getting\nworse. The policy community must refocus on this\ntopic amidst competing national security priorities\n\n# Tand do more to incentivize and support private sector se\ncurity. Failure to do so creates new and systemic national\nsecurity risks for the United States and its allies. Attackers\ncapitalizing on vulnerable software supply chains are able\nto compromise trusted software and important cybersecurity protections to impact large numbers of critical systems.\n\nSignificant economic output depends on the security\nof software every day—the sudden shift to remote\nwork is exemplary of this dependence. Without reliable\nvideo conferencing, email, and file sharing, much of the\nworld’s knowledge work would slow to a crawl. Even\nintangible capacities, like our capacity to innovate, rely\nin large part on digital tools to collaborate, coordinate,\nand revise. All of these tasks are dependent on software. Critical defense systems are equally dependent\non software. Digitized logistics processes, the ability\nto work with massive quantities of data, semiautonomous sensors, and munitions all depend on a chain of\n\n\ndigital logic embedded in software programs. Part of\nthe F-35’s own software supply chain, the Autonomous\n[Logistics Information System (ALIS), is plagued with vul-](https://www.pogo.org/analysis/2020/03/uncorrected-design-flaws-cyber-vulnerabilities-and-unreliability-plague-the-f-35-program/)\nnerabilities and testing gaps, potentially compromising\nthe entire weapons platform.[36] The supply chain for\nthese physical products is a recognized priority, but the\nsoftware enabling these systems must be as well.\n\nSoftware supply chain attacks are not an esoteric or\nisolated tactic, as this report and its associated dataset\nshows; they are popular, impactful, and have been used\nto great effect by state actors. In this dataset, we have collected 115 instances, going back a decade, of publicly reported attacks on the software supply chain or disclosure\nof high-impact vulnerabilities likely to be exploited in such\n[attacks.[37 ]Each instance of an attack or vulnerability was](http://attacks.ii)\ncoded with incident name, date, victim, and likely source,\nwhile categorizing the basic technical characteristics of\neach.

We draw no conclusions as to the frequency of attacks or vulnerabilities for this population, only trends\nwithin this dataset, and can make no claims of statistical significance as a result.\n\n\n-----\n\ndataset, we include vulnerabilities that would enable the\ninjection or distribution of malicious code rather than what\nwould be found in the code’s payload, the means of access\nrather than the harmful payloads. Figure 2 shows the distribution of attacks versus disclosures in the dataset across\nimpacted codebases.\n\nThese incidents reveal a stunning diversity—there are as\nmany potential target types in the supply chain as there\nare types of software. Certain categories have consistently\nbeen in the crosshairs for years now: software updates,\nfirmware, and third-party apps. In this dataset, others are\nbeing targeted more today than in the past. For instance,\nas smartphones become ubiquitous, mobile apps, both\nattacker-made and attacker-infiltrated, have become increasingly popular targets—as have open-source libraries\non which much software relies.\n\nFigure 3 uses an abstracted model to show the distribution\nof the 115 attacks in our dataset and disclosures across\na notional software supply chain. There is no good way\nto concisely represent software development and this\ngraphic is not intended to capture all of the intricacies\nof the process. This representation of a waterfall-style\nmodel matches with much of the software captured in the\nstudy. Agile development methodologies like software\nDevelopment/IT Operations (DevOps) and Development/\nSecurity/Operations (DevSecOps) are important but are\nalso no magic solution for software supply chain security\nissues. These Agile approaches and the philosophy of\ncontinuous integration create new opportunities to quickly\npropagate risk through a codebase.\n\n\nWhile there are attacks through this supply chain model,\nthe figure highlights their concerning concentration against\napp stores, update processes, OSS projects, and around\ncode signing. Incidents within these types often shared\nattack vectors, codebases, and distribution vectors, and\nwere carried out by similar actors with similar goals. Figure\n3 underlines just how many different opportunities exist to\nundermine a software supply chain.\n\nThe purpose of this dataset is to compile a variety of software supply chain attacks and discovered vulnerabilities,\nand to catalogue the different characteristics of each incident. While the dataset is not exhaustive, we took care\nto use consistent definitions and typologies throughout.\nWe defined attacks as occurring when attackers access\nand edit software somewhere in a software development\nsupply chain, compromising a target farther up on the\nchain, by inserting their own malicious code. Disclosures\nthat came alongside an ongoing attack were coded as an\nattack. Attacks don’t require any public disclosure of a vulnerability, only public notice of the attack itself. Software\nsupply chain vulnerabilities are any software vulnerability\nthat, if exploited, would comprise an attack. This flexibility includes a wide variety of critical vulnerabilities, so we\nlimited their scope to those that would enable injection of\nmalicious code, not just compound the effects of an attack’s payload.\n\nAll incidents were collected via manual online search for\nmedia articles, industry reporting, and researcher write-ups\nof incidents, using information in the public domain. As a\nresult, the dataset here is a lower bound on the population\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 3.

To analyze trends\nin these attacks and disclosures, we established five key\nmeasures to better understand the different elements of\nsupply chain compromise: attack vector, distribution vector, affected codebase, impact, and supply chain potential.\nNone of these five measures is exclusive: a single entry in\nthe database can have multiple insertion points or methods, distribution vectors, and so on. Information on an entry’s date, responsible actor, downstream target, links to\nrelevant articles, and a paragraph of technical summary\nwas also included.

There are clear and critical policy gaps that exist in\nsecuring our software supply chains. Users are increasingly vulnerable, whether it be as a result of malicious\napps in app stores, forged digital certificates, or vulnerable\nopen-source code frameworks.\n\nMoreover, this issue is not limited to the United States.\nState attackers have regularly employed software supply\nchain intrusions to attack the United States and its allies.\nGovernments around the world are increasingly dependent\non open-source and commercial off-the-shelf software for\nsystems relevant to national security, and are exposed to\n\n\n38 _[Breaking Trust: Shades of Crisis Across an Insecure Software Supply Chain, Atlantic Council, accessed July 15, 2020, https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/breaking-trust/)_\n[breaking-trust/.](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/breaking-trust/)\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Coding the Dataset\n\n\n**Date: Best estimated start date of the attack.

The global nature of software supply chains and the international character of\nthreats make it imperative for the United States to work\nwith partners in the private sector and allies around the\nworld to address this security challenge.\n\nThis report offers a series of recommendations that call\nfor a coalition response to the systemic threats posed by\nsoftware supply chain attacks and vulnerabilities.

The remainder of this report discusses five trends in the attacks and disclosures surveyed,\nincluding the damaging use of software supply chain attacks\nby a handful of major adversaries of the United States, efforts to undermine code-signing processes and hijack software updates, and the popularity of attacks on open-source\nprojects and app stores.

Attacks on the Software Supply Chain\n\n\nsoftware supply chain attack occurs when an\nattacker accesses and modifies software in the\ncomplex software development supply chain to\ncompromise a target farther down on the chain\nby inserting their own malicious code. These inserts can A\nbe used to further modify code by obtaining system permissions or to directly deliver a malicious payload. Modern\nsoftware products contain a vast number of dependencies\non other code, so tracking down which vulnerabilities compromise which products is a nontrivial organizational and\ntechnical feat. There are efforts underway to make tracking\nthese dependencies, and discovering them in the event of\nan incident, more straightforward. The most widely recognized is the Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) multi-stakeholder initiative coordinated by the US Department of\nCommerce, which remains in development.\n\nSoftware supply chain attacks take advantage of established channels of system verification to gain privileged\naccess to systems and to compromise large networks.\nThey undermine foundational tenets of trust in software\ndevelopment. Even with the increased exposure gained\n\n\nby these high-profile attacks, we are only just beginning to\nunderstand how wide-reaching the impact can be.\n\nThe code that attackers and researchers target has\nchanged over time within this dataset. Figure 4 shows\nthe distribution of codebases targeted by these incidents,\nwhile Figure 5 shows that distribution over time. Mobile\napps have grown more frequent in the dataset, especially\nthose created by attackers and marketed as legitimate. For\ninstance, in 2017, the Android app [Lovely Wallpaper hid](https://blog.checkpoint.com/2017/09/14/expensivewall-dangerous-packed-malware-google-play-will-hit-wallet/)\nmalware under the guise of providing phone background\nimages.[41] The malware would gain device permissions and\ncharge users’ accounts for “premium” services they had\nnot signed up for. It, and at least fifty other apps hiding the\nsame payload, infected as many as 4.2 million devices, and\nsuccessors continued to infiltrate the Google Play Store\nafter the original offenders were removed.\n\nThird-party firmware is also an increasingly popular target\nfor attackers and researchers alike—a particularly troublesome development given the inherent difficulty of patching firmware and its ability to make privileged edits and\n\n\n41 Check Point, “ExpensiveWall: A Dangerous ‘Packed’ Malware on Google Play That Will Hit Your Wallet,” Check Point Blog, accessed June 15, 2020,\n[https://blog.checkpoint.com/2017/09/14/expensivewall-dangerous-packed-malware-google-play-will-hit-wallet/.](https://blog.checkpoint.com/2017/09/14/expensivewall-dangerous-packed-malware-google-play-will-hit-wallet/)\n\n\n-----\n\navoid much anti-malware program detection.

This section\ndiscusses trends in known state software supply chain attacks supported by publicly reported attribution, focused\non four actors: Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea. The\ndata in this report also include incidents linked to Egypt,\nIndia, the United States, and Vietnam, for a total of 27 distinct attacks.\n\n**Russia**\n\n[Russian actors were responsible for the 2017 NotPetya at-](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/07/heavily-armed-police-raid-company-that-seeded-last-weeks-notpetya-outbreak/)\n[tack,[46] one of the most destructive software supply chain](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/07/heavily-armed-police-raid-company-that-seeded-last-weeks-notpetya-outbreak/)\nattacks to date. Four of the five attacks attributed to Russia\nin our dataset involved initial insertion of malicious code\ninto a third-party app, made possible by gaining access to\nan account with editing permissions. After inserting a malicious payload, Russia relied on diverse means to distribute\nthis code, including hijacked updates, a worm component,\nphishing, and a hardware component. Notably, every attack involved multiple vectors for distribution.\n\nInterestingly, three of the five attacks involved downstream targets in the energy sector. For instance, the 2015\nDragonfly 2.0 attack relied on a variety of vectors—including spear-phishing, watering-hole-style attacks, and\nTrojanized software updates—to obtain network credentials from targets in the US, Swiss, and Turkish energy\n[sectors.[47] Launched by Russian APT Energetic Bear, at-](https://www.eweek.com/security/dragonfly-2.0-hackers-targeting-the-energy-sector-symantec-finds)\ntackers were able to gain operational control of interfaces\nthat power company engineers use to send commands\n\n\nto equipment like circuit breakers, giving them the ability\nto stop the flow of electricity into homes and businesses\nin the United States. Russian attackers similarly [compro-](https://ics.sans.org/media/E-ISAC_SANS_Ukraine_DUC_5.pdf)\n[mised Ukraine’s power grid in 2015, interrupting service to](https://ics.sans.org/media/E-ISAC_SANS_Ukraine_DUC_5.pdf)\n225,000 customers in a complex infrastructure attack that\ninvolved spear phishing, credential stealing, malware insertion, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks on call\ncenters, and firmware attacks.[48] Russia has repeatedly engaged in software supply chain attacks against Ukrainian\nentities or programs since 2015, in line with its practice of\ntesting cyber war tactics in Ukraine.\n\n**China**\n\nOf the state actors featured in the dataset, China has conducted the most software supply chain attacks (eleven)\nand demonstrated the greatest level of consistency in attack and distribution methods. The earliest case attributed\nto Chinese actors was in 2011, suggesting that China has\nbeen targeting software supply chains earlier than other\nstate actors. Most Chinese attacks relied on a third-party\napplication for their initial insertion point; in the majority of\ncases, the affected code was found in an update server.\nChinese attacks were notably consistent in the method of\ndistribution: eight of eleven cases relied on hijacked updates to distribute malicious code, while several cases relied on supply chain service providers. For instance, in the\n[2017 Kingslayer attack, Chinese attackers (likely APT31) tar-](https://www.itworldcanada.com/article/canadian-cyber-firm-confirms-it-was-the-victim-described-in-rsa-investigation/390903)\ngeted a Windows IT admin application to include malicious\ncode under a valid signature, which could spread either\nby updating or downloading the application.[49] The attack\ncompromised a huge list of higher-education institutions,\nmilitary organizations, governments, banks, IT and telecom\nproviders, and other enterprises, as the malware installed\na secondary package that could up- and download files,\nexecute programs, and run arbitrary shell commands. With\nrespect to impact, Chinese attacks tended to be of vast\nscale, gaining access to the personal data of millions of\nusers, or impacting hundreds of companies.\n\nChinese software supply attacks are aimed more at corporate entities; eight attacks had companies and dependent\nusers as their downstream targets. Given that all Chinese\nattacks resulted (or could have resulted) in data extraction,\nthis data is consistent with continuing US concerns about\nChinese intellectual property theft and economic espionage.

Trump’s administration in its first\nyear in office.\n\n**North Korea**\n\nThe dataset features one software supply chain attack\nlikely linked to North Korea—the 2013 [compromise of](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/threat-encyclopedia/web-attack/124/trend-micro-investigates-june-25-cyber-attacks-in-south-korea)\n[two file-sharing services’ auto-update features in order to](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/threat-encyclopedia/web-attack/124/trend-micro-investigates-june-25-cyber-attacks-in-south-korea)\nlaunch a DDoS attack on South Korean government websites.[51] The attack was launched by the cyber adversary\n[responsible for the “DarkSeoul” attack on South Korean](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/21/world/asia/south-korea-computer-network-crashes.html)\nbanking and media in March 2013 and is consistent with\nother attacks by the group in the past.[52] This group has\npreviously launched cyberattacks on days of historical significance in the United States and South Korea. The attack\nfeatured in the dataset occurred on June 25, the anniversary of North Korea’s invasion of South Korea in 1950, which\nmarked the start of the Korean War. In early 2013, North\nKorea also conducted an underground nuclear missile test\nand, in response to tightening sanctions by the United\nNations in March, cut off communications with South Korea,\nthreatened to launch a preemptive nuclear strike against\nthe United States and South Korea, and pledged to restart\nits Yongbyon nuclear plant to provide material for its weapons program. The high-profile nature of the software attack\non June 25 and the extensive damage it caused may accordingly be seen in the context of North Korea’s escalation\nof military provocations at the time.\n\nTechnical elements of the attack are also indicative of\nmethods attributed to the adversary and North Korea\nmore generally. The attack targeted a third-party app and\nwas distributed through a hijacked software update. The\ndropped malware also allowed for remote code execution\nand established a botnet to carry out a DDoS attack, consistent with North Korea’s history of launching DDoS attacks\n(e.g., by North Korean APT Hidden Cobra). It is important\nto note that the adversary’s targeting of IP addresses that\n\n\nserve as DNS name servers demonstrates careful research\ninto the target in order to maximize damage, an approach\nalso seen in the March 2013 “DarkSeoul” attack.\n\n**Iran**\n\nThe dataset features one software supply chain attack\nweakly attributed to Iran—the 2020 [Kwampirs malware](https://www.zdnet.com/article/fbi-warns-about-ongoing-attacks-against-software-supply-chain-companies/)\n[campaign targeting companies in the industrial control sys-](https://www.zdnet.com/article/fbi-warns-about-ongoing-attacks-against-software-supply-chain-companies/)\ntems sector, especially the energy industry.[53] The attack\ninitially targeted supply chain software providers through\nexploitation of default passwords. The attackers distributed the Kwampirs Remote Access Trojan (RAT) through\nsupply chain software vendors who would install infected\ndevices on the target’s network. The attack resulted, or\nlikely resulted, in backdoor access and data extraction.\nThe Kwampirs RAT was previously deployed in 2018 by a\ngroup called Orangeworm in similar attacks against supply\nchain software companies in the healthcare sector, and\ndifferent entities feeding into the healthcare supply chain.\nWhile these attacks and the current campaign have not\nbeen directly attributed to Iran, the Kwampirs malware was\nfound to contain numerous similarities to the Shamoon data-wiping malware used by Iranian-linked APT33, and also\nemployed in multiple attacks against the energy sector.\nFireEye, a California-based cybersecurity firm, noted that\ntargeting of organizations involved in energy and petrochemicals reflects a common interest and continuing\nthread among suspected Iranian threat groups. Previous\nreports suggest Iranian actors have targeted energy sector\norganizations headquartered in the United States, Saudi\nArabia, and South Korea in an attempt to gain insight into\nregional rivals and potential competitors.\n\n**Other State Attacks**\n\nOther state actors have also engaged in software supply\nchain attacks; this dataset features incidents attributed to\n[the United States, India, Egypt, and Vietnam. Stuxnet[54]—](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2011/03/stuxnet-201104)\nwidely attributed to the United States and Israel—was one\nof the earliest examples to use stolen certificates and potentially one of a handful to leverage a hardware vector to\ncompromise.

In 2013, PassFreely enabled bypass of the](https://www.wired.com/2015/02/nsa-firmware-hacking/)\nauthentication process of Oracle Database servers and access to SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial\nTelecommunication) money transfer authentication. In\n2015, the EquationDrug & GrayFish programs used versions of nls_933w.dll to communicate with a C&C server\nto flash malicious copies of firmware onto a device’s hard\ndisk drive, infecting 500 devices. Both attacks involved a\nsupply chain service provider as a distribution vector.\n\nThe United States is generally distinguished\nfrom several of the other states highlighted here by formulation and operation of due process constraints on\nhow attacks like these are developed, targeted, and deployed. One\nformer senior US national security official [reflected of Stuxnet,](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2011/03/stuxnet-201104)\n“If a government were going to\ndo something like this, a responsible government, then it would\nhave to go through a bureaucracy,\na clearance process… It just says\nlawyers all over it”.[57] The operational\nconstraints imposed by democratic accountability and the trend toward what\n[Peter Berkowitz labeled the “lawyering of](https://www.hoover.org/research/lawyering-war)\n[war”[58] offer some meaningiful distance between](https://www.hoover.org/research/lawyering-war)\nthe United States and several of the other states on this\nlist, though those distinctions blur where legal protections\n[are ignored or interpreted beyond the bounds of accepted](https://www.cnet.com/news/court-finds-fbi-use-of-nsa-database-violated-americans-fourth-amendment-rights/)\nlogic.[59]\n\nThe attacks attributed to the other three states notably all\ninvolved attacker applications uploaded to a proprietary\napp store, leading to data extraction and often remote code\nexecution. A January 2020 attack involving three malicious\napps on Google Play Store was linked to APT SideWinder\n(previously attributed to India). The attack exploited a serious zero-day vulnerability through which the CallCam,\nCamero, and File CryptManager apps, once downloaded,\ncould extract extensive machine data, including screenshots, and send them to a C&C server. The Egyptian government is believed to have been involved in a hacking\ncampaign against Egyptian human rights activists, in which\nattackers crafted applications that used OAuth Phishing,\ngenerating fake requests for access to Google, Yahoo,\nHotmail, and Outlook accounts before stealing emails.\n\n\nThe attack also led to 5,000 downloads of malicious mobile apps from the Google Play Store that would enable\nattackers to view call log information. Finally attackers connected to Vietnam-linked APT 32 (OceanLotus), used a variety of techniques to sneak malware into various browser\ncleanup apps on the Google Play Store; the attack sent\ndevice specs to a C&C server, allowing the attackers to\ndownload custom-designed malware onto target devices,\nlikely for espionage. Three attacks from 2011 and 2012\n(Duqu, Flame, Adobe code signing hack) have not\nbeen attributed to a particular state, but likely\ninvolved state actors based on the highly\nsophisticated and targeted nature of the\nattacks. These attacks relied on a variety of attack and distribution vectors,\nand were some of the most destructive attacks in the dataset.\n\nAs discussed in the introduction,\nthis report’s findings constitute\na lower bound on the total population of supply chain attacks and\ndisclosures. The dataset’s contents\nare shaped by the limitations of publicly available research on software\nsupply chain security—both in the scope\nand geographical focus of research efforts.\nAccordingly, the dataset focuses on incidents involving state actors traditionally covered in cybersecurity\nresearch, namely, China and Russia, North Korea, and Iran\nwhile understating those from countries in the developing\nworld and Global South.\n\n###### 2.2 Abusing Trust: Code Signing\n\nCode-signing issues were among the most prolific attack\nvectors in our analysis, with many attacks stemming from\nself-signed certificates, broken signing systems, and poorly\nsecured account access as Figure 6 shows. A significant\nportion of this dataset deals with code signing and how\nattackers bypass its protections. They occur in both the development and design stage as well as at deployment with\nhijacked updates and compromised deployment servers, a\nsub-set discussed in detail in the next section.\n\nCode signing is crucial to analyzing software supply chain\nattacks because, used correctly, it ensures the integrity of\ncode and the identity of its author.

If code signing were unassailable,\nthere would be far fewer software supply chain attacks as\napplications could assert code was unmodified and coming straight from the authentic source without concern.\n\nBut there are issues with code signing, so there are software supply chain attacks, and understanding the mechanism is crucial. Code signing is an application of public\nkey cryptography and the trusted certificate system to ensure code integrity and source identity. When code is sent\nto an external source, it usually comes with a signature\nand a certificate. **The signature is a cryptographic hash**\nof the code itself that is encrypted with a private key. The\nconsumer uses the public key associated with the code\nissuer to decrypt the hash and then hashes their copy of\nthe code. If their hash matches the decrypted hash, they\nknow their copy of the code is the same as the code that\nwas hashed and encrypted by the author. The certificate\nis a combination of information that generally includes the\nname of the certificate authority (CA), the name of the software issuer, a creation and expiration date, and the public\nkey associated with their private key. It provides the CA’s\n\n\nassurance to the consumer that the issuer of the code has\nthe private key that is cryptographically connected to the\nlisted public key. The software issuer alone possesses the\nprivate key. The system’s cryptography is similar to that of\nthe certificate system behind TLS/SSL encryption (HTTPS\nconnections), but distinct in its application. (Read more on\nthe difference between code-signing certificate and SSL\n[certificate here[60]).](https://comodosslstore.com/resources/code-signing-certificate-vs-ssl-certificate-whats-the-difference/)\n\nThere are several ways attackers can bypass these systems. The above description is a simplification. There is a\nchain of certificate authority dependencies: certificates can\nexpire; there are a variety of algorithms used to sign code,\nsome good and others bad; authors can fail to secure their\nprivate keys; vetting certificate requesters is challenging;\nand more. These complexities add vulnerabilities to the\nsystem. Attackers can modify code before it is signed by\nthe issuer, meaning the code would be legitimately signed\nand still malicious. Attackers can compromise weak cryptography, which would allow them to forge a digital signature without needing to steal private keys. Attackers can\neven steal or buy private keys, allowing them to validly sign\nmalware themselves. Sometimes organizations simply leak\nthe private key by accident. Finally, some parts of computer architecture, like certain firmware drivers, were not\ndesigned with security in mind and do not even use code\n\n\n60 [“Code Signing Certificate vs SSL Certificate: What’s the Difference?” Comodo SSL Store, n.d., https://comodosslstore.com/resources/code-signing-](https://comodosslstore.com/resources/code-signing-certificate-vs-ssl-certificate-whats-the-difference/)\n[certificate-vs-ssl-certificate-whats-the-difference/.](https://comodosslstore.com/resources/code-signing-certificate-vs-ssl-certificate-whats-the-difference/)\n\n\n-----\n\nsigning. All of these options are reflected in the dataset’s\nattack vector variable.\n\nFor the purpose of this dataset, the difference between\nstealing private keys and certificates is negligible. The private key is the part of a certificate that is kept secret by the\nsoftware issuer, and the part that is stolen when the phrase\n“stolen/purchased certificate” is used. The two phrases are\ninterchangeable in most literature as well. A more technical\n[breakdown can be found here,[61] but an attacker obtaining](https://www.thesslstore.com/blog/heres-what-happens-when-your-private-key-gets-compromised/)\na legitimate certificate means that they got its associated\nprivate key.\n\nAttacks that compromise the code signing system are extremely potent—they get a victim’s system to run malicious\ncode from an apparently legitimate source with significant\nauthority to modify system files. As such, they have been\non the rise recently and are a fundamental dimension of\nsoftware supply chain attacks. (Read more about stolen\n[certificate trends here[62] and here[63]).](https://www.ciodive.com/news/stolen-digital-certificates-are-hackers-latest-weapon-of-choice/415804/)\n\nCode-signing vulnerabilities are troubling because, if used\nsuccessfully, they let attackers impersonate any trusted\nprogram and bypass some modern security tools. They\nalso sow uncertainty about the authenticity of the very\nsame patches and updates software developers use to fix\nsecurity holes in their code. In January 2020, the United\nStates’ National Security Agency (NSA) broke with precedent and disclosed [CVE-2020-0601 to Microsoft.[64] The](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-014a)\nbug is lodged in the Windows cryptographic libraries and\nallows attackers to forge the digital certificates that attest\nto an object’s identity. Developers sign their code to authenticate it as their own. This gives users a way to identify\nknown and authentic code from that which is unknown and\npossibly malicious. Browsing online to a bank? There is a\ndigital certificate at the other end of the connection which\nvalidates the bank’s website is what it purports to be.\nRunning a software program from a company like Adobe\nor Microsoft on your computer? The operating system can\ncompare that software’s digital signature with the developers’ to determine whether it is authentic or a malicious\nderivative. Code signing is an important process for establishing trust in the software supply chain.\n\n\nThe abuse of code signing is also not a recent phenom[enon. In 2012, Adobe publicly warned about an attack on](https://www.zdnet.com/article/adobe-code-signing-infrastructure-hacked-by-sophisticated-threat-actors/)\nits systems that allowed attackers to create malicious files\ndigitally signed with a valid Adobe certificate.[65] A malicious\nactor had compromised an internal Adobe build server,\ngiving it access to internal code-signing infrastructure and\nthe ability to create malware indistinguishable from legitimate Adobe software. One of the earliest examples of\nusing code signing to disguise malware as legitimate software, the Adobe compromise begat a trend. Attacks using\nstolen or altered code signatures are littered throughout\nthis paper’s dataset.\n\nIn addition to stealing or forging certificates, attackers can\nalso buy them from vendors online. These certificates could\nhave been obtained through system access, but they can\nalso come from mistakes (certificate authorities, or CAs, can\nbe tricked into giving attackers legitimate certificates), insiders (employees with access to keys can sell them), or resellers (intermediate certificate issuers who require far less\ndue diligence). The marketplaces are limited by the number\nof legitimate certificates issued, but they have been growing. The more expensive the certificate, the more trusted it\nis. The cost of a certificate is anywhere up to approximately\n$1,800 for an Extended Validation certificate issued by\nSymantec in 2016. CAs can revoke certificates that have\nbeen compromised and issue new ones, but the systems of\nreporting, intermediaries, and automatic revocation checks\nare slow to close security gaps. Moreover, without purchasing them off the black market and risking being defrauded,\nit is hard to know when certificates have actually been compromised until they are used in an attack.

The majority of hijacked updates in\nthis report’s dataset were used to spread malicious code\nto third-party applications as new versions of existing software and open-source dependencies spread malware inserted into open-source libraries. One example is GOM\nPlayer, a free media application.

In the case of the Monju reactor facility, this information was more than 40,000 internal\nemails.\n\nThe Monju attack demonstrated the pernicious ease of a\ncompromised update. Attackers were able to capitalize on\nthe trust users placed in updates. Compromise required\nlittle more than the press of a button on a seemingly legitimate update to spread the attack. Despite likely not being\nan intentional target, the Monju reactor facility fell victim to\nan attack on a widely popular but simple media player—underlining how the tangled nature of software supply chains\ncan easily bring innocuous code to high-consequence targets.

Looking\nacross the software supply chain, there are a variety of\ntypes of codebase interleaving in a complex web of dependencies. Even larger-scale proprietary projects like\nthe Windows operating system integrate large amounts\nof open-source code. How these projects are built and\nmanaged can shed light on the feasibility of widely adopting best practices for things like code integrity and longterm updates.\n\nThere are two significant, and distinct, cultures of software\ndevelopment: open-source and proprietary. Both shaped\nby the principles of their communities and the legal sta[tus of their products. Proprietary software is code owned](http://metispartners.com/ip-basics/informal-ip/proprietary-software-code/)\nby a single individual or organization.[73] Some of the most\nwell-known examples of proprietary code are Microsoft\n\n\nWindows, Adobe Flash Player, Skype, and Apple’s iOS.\nApple’s iOS is developed in house, a product of the\nCupertino giant’s design, market research, and myriad\ndevelopment teams. Thus, the vast majority of software\nproduced for iOS is controlled, updated, licensed, and sold\nby Apple without outside development.\n\n[In contrast, an open-source community is defined as “an](https://timreview.ca/article/410)\ninteracting, self-governing group involved in creating innovation with members contributing toward a shared goal\nof developing free/libre innovation.”[74] Open-source developers voluntarily collaborate to develop software that is\nvaluable to them or their organization. Open source has\nbecome the [bedrock of technological innovations like](https://techcrunch.com/2014/02/13/please-dont-tell-me-you-want-to-be-the-next-red-hat/)\ncloud computing, software-as-a-service, next generation\ndatabases, mobile devices, and a consumer-focused\nInternet.[75] Figure 10 aggregates this evolving attack surface by looking at just attacks and vulnerabilities targeting\nproprietary versus OSS codebases.\n\nMost open-source projects do _not_ follow strict organizational structures, instead relying on self-organization and a\ncollaborative approach to drive software innovation and development.

An npm publisher, Azer, removed 273\npackages from the online JavaScript repository, including left-pad, a simple but commonly relied on\nprogram that pads a string with zeros on its left. So\nmany programs relied on Azer’s left-pad, or programs that relied on left-pad, or programs that relied on programs relying on left-pad (ad nauseam)\nthat hundreds of failures per minute occurred before npm republished the package two hours later,\nleading some users to claim that Azer “broke the\nInternet.”\n\n\nintellectual property in order to create and benefit from a\nlarger marketplace of ideas.[76] Open source has given rise to\na complex social web, with some supportive of limited and\ngeneral copyrights even for code which is never sold, and\nothers objecting to anything less than free software. Richard\nStallman, founder of the GNU project and co-founder of the\nLeague for Programming Freedom, is famously quoted as\nsaying “free software is a political movement; open source is\na development model.”[77] Stallman believes that, like speech,\npeople should be free to code whatever and whenever they\nwant.\n\nThere are two major types of OSS. Project or community-based OSS is the most common example: a distributed\ncommunity of developers who continuously update and\nimprove a codebase.\n\nRuby is a classic example of open-source development.\nIt is a community-based open-source codebase created\nin 1995 by Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto with a focus on\n[“simplicity and productivity.”[78] Twitter, Hulu, Shopify, and](https://www.houseofbots.com/news-detail/3957-1-python-vs-ruby-which-is-better-for-every-programmer-and-why)\nGroupon are just a few well-known sites built with Ruby.\n\n\nIndividuals can manage their own packages and dependencies on a day-to-day basis to ensure their quality. Using\na collection of package, version, and gem managers, as\nwell as the web framework Ruby on Rails, the Ruby codebase is diverse and constantly growing. Attacks on Ruby\nfeature in four different incidents in the dataset includ[ing a March 2019 attack on the “strong_password” gem](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1owqdOhyw3szhcgnEoJrFmxu2Z7Sf-WTTSoI4f_6kTTc/edit)\nwhich inserted a backdoor into code used to evaluate the\nstrength of passwords on websites. The gem was downloaded more than 500 times before a single developer\nauditing the code noticed the change.\n\nThe second, less intuitive type of open-source project is\ncommercial open-source software (COSS). The major difference between the two is that COSS has an owner with\nfull copyright, patents, and trademarks despite its development by a broader community. Up until its purchase by IBM\nin 2019, Red Hat was the largest COSS entity in the world.\nThe company runs and operates an eponymous distribution (version) of the Linux operating system. Linux has ex[isted since 1991 and is found[79] in everything from cars and](https://pagely.com/blog/citizen-guide-open-source-community/)\nhome appliances to supercomputers. [Red Hat maintains](https://techcrunch.com/2014/02/13/please-dont-tell-me-you-want-to-be-the-next-red-hat/)\nprofitability by giving away its OSS, but charging customers for support, maintenance, and installation.[80]\n\nWhile proprietary code is owned by a single entity code\nand generally sold for profit, it can include open-source\nelements either directly or as part of a network of software\naround the product. MacOS is famously based in large part\non the FreeBSD (Berkeley Software Distribution) version of\n[Unix, and Windows 10 now includes a Microsoft-developed](https://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-10-is-getting-a-microsoft-built-linux-kernel/)\nversion of the full Linux kernel.[81]\n\nThe open-source development model is extremely flexible and can achieve all sorts of software functionality\nthrough a multitude of different development communities. Apache software is developed and maintained by\nthe Apache Software Foundation and is the most widely\n[used free web server in the world, running 67 percent of](https://pagely.com/blog/citizen-guide-open-source-community/)\nall web servers.[82] OpenSSL is a software toolkit that implements the Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Secure\n[Sockets Layer (SSL) protocols The project is maintained by](https://www.openssl.org/community/)\ndesignated management and technical committees, and\n\n\n76 J.V.

Figure 11 illustrates the distribution of targeted code\ntypes, including open-source software, by different types\nof attackers.[86]\n\nAttacks on OSS have grown more frequent in recent years.\nIn February 2020, two accounts uploaded more than 700\npackages to the Ruby repository and used typosquatting\nto achieve more than 100,000 downloads of their malware,\nwhich redirected Bitcoin payments to attacker-controlled\nwallets. Many of these attacks remain viable against users\nfor weeks or months after software is patches because of\nthe frequency with which open source projects patch and\nfail to notify users. Repositories and hubs can do more to\n\n\nhelp, providing easy to use tools for developers to notify\nusers of changes and updates and shorten the time between when a vulnerability is fixed and users notified.\n\n###### 2.5 Downloading Trouble: App Hubs/Stores under Attack\n\nApp hubs/stores were a popular means of disseminating\nsoftware supply chain attacks in our analysis. The stores\nare a common feature of the software ecosystem and how\nmany users interact with the software supply chain on a\nregular basis. They serve as a marketplace for products\nand updates from third-party developers. Some apps fulfill specific functions, like advanced graphing calculators\nor audio editing suites. Others integrate different services\nlike the Google Drive and Gmail apps for iOS. A few enable features relying on access to multiple devices, like\ntwo-factor authentication. Still more provide a window to\nmassively popular platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and\nSnapchat, which are sometimes only accessible from mobile devices.

Malware obfuscation techniques have continued to evolve, and the\nvolume of apps that need screening has also increased.\n\nApp store attacks generally unfold in one of three ways.\nAttackers can build their own apps, designed to appear\nlegitimate, perhaps providing wallpapers, tutorial videos,\n\n\nor games. Hidden in those applications, which might function as advertised, is malicious software. Sometimes when\nattackers create their own apps, they try to impersonate\nlegitimate ones either through typosquatting or by posing as updates (the difference being that the latter will\nnot provide functionality to the user). One example is the\n[ExpensiveWall attack, named after one of several apps](https://blog.checkpoint.com/2017/09/14/expensivewall-dangerous-packed-malware-google-play-will-hit-wallet/)\nthat attackers uploaded to the Google Play Store, Lovely\nWallpaper, which provided background images for mobile\nusers.[89] The malicious software in the apps evaded Google\nPlay’s screening system using encryption and other obfuscation techniques. The malware, once downloaded,\ncharged user accounts and sent fraudulent premium SMS\nmessages, driving revenue to the attackers. It could also\nbe easily modified to extract sensitive data and even microphone recordings from victims’ machines. The malware\nwas eventually found in more than 50 apps cumulatively\ndownloaded between 1 and 4.2 million times before they\nwere removed from the store (installed apps remained on\ndevices until users opted to remove them).\n\n\n87 [Avi Bashan, “Mobile Security: Why App Stores Don’t Keep Users Safe,” Dark Reading, March 24, 2016, https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities---](https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities---threats/mobile-security-why-app-stores-dont-keep-users-safe/a/d-id/1324829)\n[threats/mobile-security-why-app-stores-dont-keep-users-safe/a/d-id/1324829; Catalin Cimpanu. ”Open-Source Spyware Makes It on the Google Play](https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities---threats/mobile-security-why-app-stores-dont-keep-users-safe/a/d-id/1324829)\n[Store,” ZDNet, August 22, 2019, https://www.zdnet.com/article/open-source-spyware-makes-it-on-the-google-play-store/.](https://www.zdnet.com/article/open-source-spyware-makes-it-on-the-google-play-store/)\n88 [Jeremy Hsu, “The Strava Heat Map and the End of Secrets,” WIRED, January 29, 2018, https://www.wired.com/story/strava-heat-map-military-bases-](https://www.wired.com/story/strava-heat-map-military-bases-fitness-trackers-privacy/)\n[fitness-trackers-privacy/; Foeke Postma, “Military and Intelligence Personnel Can Be Tracked with the Untappd Beer App,” Bell?ngcat, May 18, 2020,](https://www.wired.com/story/strava-heat-map-military-bases-fitness-trackers-privacy/)\n[https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2020/05/18/military-and-intelligence-personnel-can-be-tracked-with-the-untappd-beer-app/; “Threat Research,”](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2020/05/18/military-and-intelligence-personnel-can-be-tracked-with-the-untappd-beer-app/)\n[VMWare Carbon Black, accessed June 15, 2020, https://www.carbonblack.com/threat-research/; Niraj Chokshi, “Hack of Quest Diagnostics App Exposes](https://www.carbonblack.com/threat-research/)\n[Data of 34,000 Patients,” New York Times, December 12, 2016, https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/12/us/hack-of-quest-diagnostics-app-exposes-data-of-](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/12/us/hack-of-quest-diagnostics-app-exposes-data-of-34000-patients.html?_r=0)\n[34000-patients.html?_r=0.](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/12/us/hack-of-quest-diagnostics-app-exposes-data-of-34000-patients.html?_r=0)\n89 Check Point, “ExpensiveWall.”\n\n\n-----\n\nAttackers can also repackage apps, meaning they take a\nlegitimate app, add their own malicious code, and then\nbundle it as a complete item for download, usually on third[party sites. In one case, attackers repackaged Android ver-](https://threatpost.com/malicious-pokemon-go-app-installs-backdoor-on-android-devices/119174/)\nsions of Pokémon Go to include the DroidJack malware,\nwhich could access almost all of an infected device’s data and send it to an attacker C&C\nserver by simply asking for extra app permissions.[90] The attackers placed the\nmalware-infested app on third-party\nstores to take advantage of the\ngame’s staggered release schedule, preying on users looking for\nearly access to the game.\n\nThere is also publicly available\nevidence that groups compromise\nthe software used to build apps,\nalso known as software development kits (SDKs), allowing them to\ninject malware into legitimate apps as\nthey are created. Whatever the model,\nmalicious actors make an effort to obfuscate\ntheir malware to evade detection by app store curators. Compromising development tools used to build apps\nfor those stores provides tremendous scale in a software\n[supply chain attack. One example is the XcodeGhost mal-](https://www.wired.com/2015/09/hack-brief-malware-sneaks-chinese-ios-app-store/)\n[ware, first detected early in the fall of 2015.[91] Xcode is a](https://www.wired.com/2015/09/hack-brief-malware-sneaks-chinese-ios-app-store/)\ndevelopment environment used exclusively to create iOS\nand OS X apps. Typically, the tool is downloaded directly\n\n\nfrom the App Store, but it is available elsewhere on the\nweb outside Apple’s review. A version of Xcode found on\nBaidu Yunpan, a Chinese file-sharing service, came embedded with malicious logic that modified apps created\nin the development environment. Each app created with\nXcodeGhost relayed information about a customer’s device once the app had been downloaded, such as time, location, name of\ndevice, and network type. It also allowed attackers to phish credentials,\nopen URLs, and access a device’s\nclipboard, which can often contain\npassword and payment information. This version of Xcode was\nlater dubbed XcodeGhost.\n\nMultiple apps created with XcodeGhost were accepted into Apple’s\nApp Store, including malicious versions of WeChat, WinZip, and China\nUnicom Mobile Office, eventually impacting more than 500 users. XcodeGhost\naptly demonstrates the significance of app\nstores as a distribution method. While Apple’s\nApp Store is generally more rigorously policed, we recorded four successful attacks targeting it compared\nwith more than a dozen against Google Play Store and\nother third-party distributors.

The sustained growth of software supply\nchain attacks is caused at a technical level by con\n# Stinued failure to secure code integrity. Attackers continue\n\nto find ways to access accounts and bypass code signing,\napp stores struggle to verify the innocuity of all their software, developers embed insecure design choices at the\nlowest level of computing, and vendors have difficulty fully\ngrasping the scope of their software dependencies and\nreliance on supply chain service providers. These are complex technical challenges with neither easy nor immediate\nsolutions, and they further complicate the lapse in policy\nprogress to secure a supply chain that has grown critical\nto industry and national security.\n\nThe most disconcerting trend of this entire\ndataset is the consistency with which\nthese attacks occur against sensitive\nportions of the supply chain—this is\nnot a new problem. A [2010 report](https://resources.sei.cmu.edu/library/asset-view.cfm?assetid=9337)\nfrom Carnegie Mellon University’s\nSoftware Engineering Institute\nprofiled the DoD’s concern that\n“security vulnerabilities could be\ninserted into software.”[92]\n\nProgress to improve the security of\nthese supply chains has been halting\nfor a multitude of reasons. Open-source\nprojects continue to play a central role in\nenabling new software products and services,\nand fill critical gaps in the security architecture of\nthe Internet. Despite this, efforts to better resource and\nsecure these projects, like the Linux Foundation’s Core\nInfrastructure Initiative, remain too few and under-resourced\nrelative to the problem. Standards and existing security\ntools are too often applied with a “check-once-at-one-pointin-time” mindset. Scanning for vulnerabilities and working to\nremediate them is a constant process. Auditing the trust of\nan update channel, verifying the integrity of new code in a\nproduction environment, and assessing risks from third parties and open-source packages must be ongoing activities.\n\nPolicy efforts which proliferate practices, protocols, standards, and codes of conduct which can’t be automated or\n\n\nwhich are not straightforward to implement at compile or\ncommit time are insufficient to the problem. Software developers thrive on tools and dynamic means to implement\ncontrols on their code. Some public sector agencies have\nbegun to better acknowledge this. The NSA recently open\nsourced a well-featured reverse engineering tool called\nGhidra alongside a host of small programs to ingest and\nanalyze large security datasets. This is far from the norm,\nhowever, and more can be done both to tie security standards efforts to automation and tooling as well as push for\nmore DoD, Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and\nNSA tools to be open sourced and made publicly useful.\n\nMany of these recommendations focus on the role of DHS’\nCybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency\n(CISA) and could be improved through CISA’s\ncollaboration with the NSA’s still new\nCybersecurity Directorate. While there\nare flashes of sibling rivalry between\nthe two, together they would leverage a significantly deeper pool of\ntechnical expertise and security\nacumen than alone. Failure to collaborate would impact not only\nefforts to improve open-source\nsecurity but also the proposed\nimprovements to baseline software supply chain security and efforts to counter systemic threats. In\nmany cases we advocate for a CISA or\nNSA role in particular efforts but there is\nsubstitutability.\n\nThe United States and its allies cannot afford drive-by reforms. Sustained improvement is necessary. The power of\nthe software supply chain is how it enables rapid and often\nlow-cost change in the functionality of complex systems.\nThis same rapidity can be the undoing of users and organizations. Policy makers should focus on supporting industry\nefforts to improve the supply chain security baseline and\ncollaborate to reduce the impact of state attacks. Risk is\nthe name of the game—not bought completely away or\nmitigated through whiz bang technology but managed deliberately, thoughtfully, and consistently. In this the report\nowes an intellectual debt to numerous prior efforts but particularly three reports, the New York Cyber Task Force’s\n\n\n92 Robert J. Ellison, John B. Goodenough, Charles B. Weinstock, and Carol Woody, “Evaluating and Mitigating Software Supply Chain Security Risks,”\n[Carnegie Mellon University’s Software Engineering Institute, May 2010, https://resources.sei.cmu.edu/library/asset-view.cfm?assetid=9337.](https://resources.sei.cmu.edu/library/asset-view.cfm?assetid=9337)\n\n\n-----\n\n_Building a Defensible Cyberspace[93], MITRE’s_ _Deliver_\n_Uncompromised[94], and the Carnegie Endowment Cyber_\nPolicy Initiative’s ICT Supply Chain Integrity: Principles for\n_Governmental and Corporate Policies[95]._\n\nSoftware will continue to “eat” the world and these recommendations are meant to support that—enabling more effective risk management and improved security practices\nbroadly to raise the baseline cost of software supply chain\nattacks and reduce the impact of the most consequential:\n\n###### 3.1 Improve the Baseline\n\nSoftware supply chain attacks and disclosures that exploit\nvulnerabilities across the lifecycle of software in this dataset are too cheap relative to the harm they can impose.\nFor example, while software updates are the critical channel to bring updates and patches to software users, they\nhave been hijacked consistently over the past decade.\nThe problem is generally not developers brewing their\nown cryptographic protections or poorly implemented accepted protocols but failing to rigorously implement basic\nprotections for their networks, systems, and build servers.\n\nThis cluster of recommendations is intended to reduce\nthe complexity and burden of implementing secure software supply chain practices across organizations and software projects of all sizes. The central pillar is a new “Life\nCycle Security Overlay” for Special Publication (SP) 80053 developed by the National Institute of Standards and\nTechnology (NIST), which integrates other identified industry best practices. SP 800-53 is one of the most complete\nbodies of security controls and has global visibility through\nthe Cybersecurity Framework. SP 800-53 is not perfect; it\nlocks in an impact-centric model of auditing and assurance\nand often trades compliance for risk management, but it\nis a tool in hand and far more useful today than an as-yet\nundeveloped specification many years out.\n\nRaising the cost of software supply chain attacks should\ncenter on providing the whole of industry, from SAP and\nMicrosoft down to a three-person LiDAR startup, easy-touse tools and well-defined reference implementations for\nmajor cloud and IT vendors that make rigorous security\n\n\nas low-effort and cheap as possible. Efforts to build an assessable maturity model, identify reference implementations for this Overlay, and build an open-source tooling to\nsupport these implementations all build from the Overlay\nitself. These would provide resources to developers as well\nas a framework to measure software supply chain security\nperformance in federal contracting, opening the possibility that such measures could trickle down into the private\nsector and be enforced within segments of the technology\nmarketplace. These steps also support implementation of\nrecommendations made by others on improving operational coordination and developing security metrics necessary to “build solutions that scale at least cost for greater\nsecurity.”[96] Finally, this section calls for an organization to\nmaintain the value of these tools over time, collecting, curating, and caring for the most useful long into the future.\n\n\n**FIRST**\n\n\n93 [New York Cyber Task Force.

Conclusion\n\nupply chain security risk is growing and increasingly manifesting as harm to software users. There\nare many steps between the codebase they first\ncompromise and their final targets, so the distribu\n# Stion vectors of attack—how they ripple across the supply\n\nchain—are just as varied as the first point of impact, though\nthe two are often connected. Popular methods of attack\ninclude taking advantage of automated updates, compromising software development applications, and sneaking\ninto mobile app stores. Even the act of infiltrating the supply chain with malware is intricate, involving stealing or\nforging code-signing certificates, breaking into developer\naccounts, or unearthing hardcoded default passwords.\n\nSoftware supply chain attacks are first and foremost about variety—a variety of attackers\nranging from undergraduate students to\nthe world’s most sophisticated state\noffensive cyber groups, of targets\nthat range from uranium enrichment\ncentrifuges to mobile video games,\nand of impacts that can result in\nmulti-billion-dollar losses, rampant\ndata interception, or absolutely\nnothing. The supply chains underlying final products grow longer\nand less linear over time. In this interconnected software environment,\nsuccessful attacks migrate away from\nthe final targets that harden their own\nvulnerabilities and toward the weakest links\nin those chains. The soft spots that software\nsupply chain attacks target remain minimally protected\nbecause of the technical challenges of recognizing the full\nscope of a product’s code dependencies and the policy\nchallenges of coordinating disclosure and patching.\n\nA consistent pattern of attacks and disclosures target software supply chains. Despite this, these supply chains remain\npoorly secured and policy maker attention on supply chain\nissues is distracted by the 5G debate. This ignores a critical national security risk posed by insecure software supply chains, namely: the accumulated harm to private sector\n\n\nfirms impacted by untrustworthy code and a generation of\ndefense systems reliant on commercial software. Software\nsupply chain attacks are popular, they are impactful, and\nthey have been used to great effect by major US adversaries. This report surveyed a decade of software supply chain\nattacks and disclosures—115 incidents in all—to develop\na picture of the problem and develop five trends as software supply chain attacks are used to big effect, break the\nchain, abuse trust, poison the well, and download trouble.\nBuilding on these trends, the report recommends the policy community improve the baseline of software security for\nall organizations, better protect open source, and counter\nhigh-consequence supply chain threats.\n\nIt would be a grave mistake to equate software\nsupply chain attacks to a new weapon system in an opponent’s arsenal—they are a\nmanifestation of opportunity as much\nas intent, attacking secure targets\nby compromising weaknesses in\nconnected neighbors and vendors.\nExisting gaps in best practices, and\npoor adoption of these best practices, have granted these software\nsupply chain attacks unnerving\nsustainability. There are even signs\nthat the most fruitful software supply\nchain targets in firmware and at the\nheart of major cloud service providers\nhave yet to peak in popularity.\n\nThe implication of this for the technology industry and cybersecurity policymaking community is a\ncrisis in waiting. For the national security establishment,\nattacks on the software supply chain threaten a generation of technology acquisitions and undermine the COTS\nmodel of development. As the recommendations of this\nreport bear out, change is necessary and feasible but it\nwill require concentrated purpose and clarity of outcome\nat a time when both are in short supply. This report finds\nevidence that the past decade has seen software supply\nchain attacks become only more common and effective.\nWithout action, the next decade may be worse.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### About the Authors\n\nDr. Trey Herr is the director of the Cyber Statecraft Initiative under the Scowcroft Center for\nStrategy and Security at the Atlantic Council.
