It displayed a fake security warning from Windows\nDefender Antivirus within a Microsoft Word document. The fake alert also copied logos stolen\nfrom three other real firms.\n\nAccording to the template, the sender supposedly encrypted the Word document with\n‘corporative firewall.’\n\nIt then instructed the user to decrypt the document’s contents by clicking ‘Enable Content’\nand enabling macros.\n\nCompliance with that request caused the document’s malicious macros to execute and to\ninstall Emotet malware on the victim’s computer.\n\n## What Is Emotet?\n\nEmotet is a complex trojan that commonly operates as a downloader of other malware\nsamples. In the attack described above, Emotet downloaded QBot onto the victim’s\ncomputer when installed.\n\n[During the summer of 2020, both Malwarebytes and](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/trojans/2020/07/long-dreaded-emotet-has-returned/) [Check Point observed a resurgence of](https://blog.checkpoint.com/2020/08/07/julys-most-wanted-malware-emotet-strikes-again-after-five-month-absence/)\nEmotet activity after those responsible for the trojan had seemingly gone quiet for five\nmonths.\n\nEmotet’s handlers didn’t hold back in the months that followed. At the beginning of October\n2020, for instance, the [U.S. Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency revealed in an](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-280a)\nadvisory that it had detected 16,000 alerts pertaining to Emotet since July of that year.\n\n[The warning arrived just days after Bleeping Computer spotted an attack campaign in which](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/emotet-malware-takes-part-in-the-2020-us-elections/)\nEmotet capitalized on the interest surrounding the 2020 U.S. presidential election by sending\nout emails that referenced a legitimate Democratic National Convention initiative.\n\n## QBot Malware’s Busy Year\n\nQBot also had its fair share of fun last year.\n\nBack in June, for instance, [F5 Labs spotted a dedicated campaign in which digital attackers](https://www.f5.com/labs/articles/threat-intelligence/qbot-banking-trojan-still-up-to-its-old-tricks)\nused a browser hijack or redirection to target banks in the United States with the informationstealing trojan.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Things ramped up in August when QBot entered Check Point s monthly top 10 malware](https://blog.checkpoint.com/2020/09/09/august-2020s-most-wanted-malware-evolved-qbot-trojan-ranks-on-top-malware-list-for-first-time/)\n[index for the first time at 10th place. That same month, researchers at the security firm](https://research.checkpoint.com/2020/exploring-qbots-latest-attack-methods/)\nrevealed that they had witnessed the malware using a new “email collector module” to\nextract email threads from a victim’s Outlook client and to upload that data to a remote server\nunder its attackers’ control.\n\nBy the [following month, this new trick had helped QBot to climb to sixth place on Check](https://blog.checkpoint.com/2020/10/07/september-2020s-most-wanted-malware-new-info-stealing-valak-variant-enters-top-10-malware-list-for-first-time/)\nPoint’s malware list.\n\nIn [November, QBot followed the example of Emotet by wading into the 2020 presidential](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/cybercrime/2020/11/qbot-delivered-via-malspam-campaign-exploiting-us-election-uncertainties/)\nelection. In this case, email attackers used claims of election tampering to trick people into\nopening corrupted Excel files.\n\n## How to Defend Against QBot Malware\n\nThe persistence of threats such as QBot and Emotet highlights the need for defenses\nagainst email-borne malware. They can do this by regularly testing their employees’\nawareness with phishing attacks and by using role-based employee education to instruct the\nentire workforce about the types of threats that might enter their inboxes.\n\nAt the same time, consider developing dedicated incident response plans, processes and\nteams. These could help reduce the harm of a successful email attack that might be carrying\na malware payload. To make sure they’re protected, you should test those processes and\nplans on a regular basis.\n\n[Antivirus |](https://securityintelligence.com/tag/antivirus/) [Malware |](https://securityintelligence.com/tag/malware/) [Windows](https://securityintelligence.com/tag/windows/)\n[David Bisson](https://securityintelligence.com/author/david-bisson/)\nContributing Editor\n\nDavid Bisson is an infosec news junkie and security journalist.
