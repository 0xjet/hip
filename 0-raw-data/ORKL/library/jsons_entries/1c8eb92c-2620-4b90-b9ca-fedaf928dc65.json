Friday, August 24, 2018 By: Counter Threat Unit Research Team_\n\nIn August 2018, members of university communities worldwide may have been providing\naccess to more than just homework assignments.\n\n\n-----\n\nSecureworks® Counter Threat Unit™ (CTU) researchers discovered a URL spoofing a login\npage for a university. Further research into the IP address hosting the spoofed page revealed\na broader campaign to steal credentials. Sixteen domains contained over 300 spoofed\nwebsites and login pages for 76 universities located in 14 countries, including Australia,\nCanada, China, Israel, Japan, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United\nStates (see Figure 1).\n\n_Figure 1. Countries with targeted universities. The darker the color, the higher the number of_\n_affected universities. (Source: Secureworks)_\n\nAfter entering their credentials into the fake login page, victims were redirected to the\nlegitimate website where they were automatically logged into a valid session or were\nprompted to enter their credentials again. Numerous spoofed domains referenced the\ntargeted universities' online library systems, indicating the threat actors' intent to gain access\nto these resources.\n\nCTU™ researchers were unable to confirm functionality of all identified spoofed pages\nbecause some of the domains were not accessible at the time of analysis. Many of the\ndomains were registered between May and August 2018, with the most recent being\nregistered on August 19. Domain registrations indicate the infrastructure to support this\ncampaign was still being created when CTU researchers discovered the activity.\n\nMost of the domains observed in this campaign resolved to the same IP address and DNS\nname server. A domain registered in May 2018 also contained subdomains spoofing\nuniversity targets. These subdomains redirected visitors to spoofed login pages on other\nattacker-controlled domains.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe pain of parting is nothing to the joy of meeting again.\n\n— Nicholas Nickleby by Charles Dickens\n\nThe targeting of online academic resources is similar to previous cyber operations by\nCOBALT DICKENS, a threat group associated with the Iranian government. In those\noperations, which also shared infrastructure with the August attacks, the threat group created\nlookalike domains to phish targets and used credentials to steal intellectual property from\nspecific resources, including library systems. In March 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice\n[indicted the Mabna Institute and nine Iranian nationals in connection with COBALT DICKENS](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/nine-iranians-charged-conducting-massive-cyber-theft-campaign-behalf-islamic-revolutionary)\nactivity occurring between 2013 and 2017. Many threat groups do not change their tactics\ndespite public disclosures, and CTU analysis suggests that COBALT DICKENS may be\nresponsible for the university targeting despite the indictments of some members.\n\nUniversities are attractive targets for threat actors interested in obtaining intellectual property.\nIn addition to being more difficult to secure than heavily regulated finance or healthcare\norganizations, universities are known to develop cutting-edge research and can attract global\nresearchers and students. CTU researchers have contacted various global partners to\naddress this threat.\n\nThis widespread spoofing of login pages to steal credentials reinforces the need for\norganizations to incorporate multifactor authentication using secure protocols and implement\ncomplex password requirements on publicly accessible systems. CTU researchers\nrecommend that clients implement training programs to educate users about security threats,\nincluding guidance for recognizing and reporting suspicious emails.\n\nCTU researchers have identified indicators for this threat (see Table 1). Note that IP\naddresses can be reallocated. The domains and IP address may contain malicious content,\nso consider the risks before opening them in a browser.\n\n**Indicator** **Type** **Context**\n\n\nanvc.me Domain\nname\n\neduv.icu Domain\nname\n\njhbn.me Domain\nname\n\n\nHosting phishing website used by COBALT DICKENS\n\nHosting phishing website used by COBALT DICKENS\n\nHosting phishing website used by COBALT DICKENS\n\n\n-----\n\nnimc.cf Domain\nname\n\nuncr.me Domain\nname\n\nunie.ga Domain\nname\n\nunie.ml Domain\nname\n\nunin.icu Domain\nname\n\nunip.cf Domain\nname\n\nunip.gq Domain\nname\n\nunir.cf Domain\nname\n\nunir.gq Domain\nname\n\nunir.ml Domain\nname\n\nunisv.xyz Domain\nname\n\nuniv.red Domain\nname\n\nuntc.me Domain\nname\n\n\nHosting phishing website used by COBALT DICKENS\n\nHosting phishing website used by COBALT DICKENS\n\nHosting phishing website used by COBALT DICKENS\n\nHosting phishing website used by COBALT DICKENS\n\nHosting phishing website used by COBALT DICKENS\n\nHosting phishing website used by COBALT DICKENS\n\nHosting phishing website used by COBALT DICKENS\n\nHosting phishing website used by COBALT DICKENS\n\nHosting phishing website used by COBALT DICKENS\n\nHosting phishing website used by COBALT DICKENS\n\nHosting phishing website used by COBALT DICKENS\n\nHosting phishing website used by COBALT DICKENS\n\nHosting phishing website used by COBALT DICKENS\n\n\n-----\n\nuntf.me Domain\nname\n\nunts.me Domain\nname\n\nunvc.me Domain\nname\n\nebookfafa.com Domain\nname\n\nlib-service.com Domain\nname\n\n\nHosting phishing website used by COBALT DICKENS\n\nHosting phishing website used by COBALT DICKENS\n\nHosting phishing website used by COBALT DICKENS\n\nHosting subdomains associated with COBALT DICKENS\nphishing targets\n\nHosting subdomains associated with COBALT DICKENS\nphishing targets\n\n\n208.115.226.68 IP address Hosting suspicious and phishing domains used by\nCOBALT DICKENS\n\n_Table 1.
