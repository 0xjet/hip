The framework contains numerous features which we\nassess may be utilized in the enablement of malicious activities.\n\nThe technical entry bar for the framework is purposefully kept low, which has served to\ncreate an active community of content developers and contributors, with actors in the\nunderground economy advertising their time for the creation of bespoke tooling.\n\nThe framework warranted further research due to the high number of distinct threat groups\nwho include it in their toolkits.\n\n## Introduction\n\nDuring three recent (and separate) investigations into command and control (C2)\ninfrastructure for [Bumblebee loader, and](https://www.securityweek.com/new-bumblebee-malware-loader-used-several-cybercrime-groups) [BlackGuard and](https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/analysis-blackguard-new-info-stealer-malware-being-sold-russian-hacking) [RedLine stealers, our analysts](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/new-redline-stealer-distributed-using-coronavirus-themed-email-campaign)\nobserved connections from the C2s to a tool repository / marketplace called Bablosoft.\n\n**Figure 1:**\n\n**Overview of Observed Relationships**\n\n\n-----\n\nLooking into open-source reporting, we found that other vendors had previously come across\nBablosoft in their investigations:\n\n[General research by F5 Labs into credential stuffing attacks](https://www.f5.com/labs/articles/threat-intelligence/2021-credential-stuffing-report)\n[Research by NTT into the toolkit utilized by GRIM SPIDER](https://hello.global.ntt/-/media/ntt/global/insights/white-papers/grim-spider-white-paper.pdf)\n\n**Figure 2:**\n\n**Screenshot from the NTT Analysis of GRIM SPIDER Infrastructure**\n\nIn this blog post, we will examine Bablosoft in further detail, providing our hypotheses on the\nthreat actor use cases for the tools on offer, and highlighting links to other threat activity.\n\n## Bablosoft\n\n Insight from Open Source\n\nReferences to Bablosoft first appeared within public forums during late 2016, when the ‘main’\ndeveloper – who goes by the moniker Twaego – posted about the release of a tool entitled\n**_BrowserAutomationStudio (BAS)._**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 3:**\n\n**Twaego’s First Post About Bablosoft and BrowserAutomationStudio**\n\nAs can be discerned from the advert, the purpose of BAS is to provide users with an easy-touse framework for the creation of bots, including “spammers” and a “credentials checker”.\n\nReviewing this and other public threads on BAS / Bablosoft, it is clear the tool was well\nreceived by the community, for several reasons:\n\nThe tool is free – although a premium version with additional features is available\nThe developer (Twaego) actively works on community feedback/requests to improve\nthe tool\nUsers can share applications/scripts through the Bablosoft community page\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 4:**\n\n**An Example of the Bablosoft Script Repositories**\n\nThe postings also provided further insight into some of the tool’s capabilities; browser\nemulation, mimicking of human behavior (keyboard and mouse), proxy support, a mailbox\nsearch feature, and the ability to load data from file/URL/string. Features which have caught\nthe eye of several distinct threat actor operations.\n\nIn underground forums we have identified users ‘offering their services’ for the creation of\nbespoke scripts for BAS, for example to interact with the Telegram API, or the development\nof “bruters” and “recruiters”.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 5:**\n\n**Posting by ‘BasCoder’ on the XSS Forum**\n\nIn the post above, the user BasCoder provides an overview of a business-like service,\ninclusive of a ‘free consultation’, with projects priced from $20 depending on scale. We\nidentified a ‘thank you’ post from another user who appeared to have used BasCoder’s\nservices for a BAS-related project.\n\n**Figure 6:**\n\n**‘Customer’ Feedback Post on the XSS Forum**\n\nThe customer in this case, a user called n1ppyyy, is a now-banned but formerly active\nmember of the XSS forum who engaged in numerous topics indicative of an interest or\ninvolvement in malicious activity.\n\n## Insight from Threat Telemetry\n\nIn the cases of the Bumblebee, BlackGuard and RedLine C2s, we observed connections to\n**_downloads.bablosoft[.]com (resolving to 46.101.13.144). Threat telemetry for this IP_**\naddress provides an insight into the general user base for Bablosoft, with the majority of\n\n\n-----\n\nactivity coming from locations in Russia and Ukraine (based on WHOIS information).\n\n**Figure 7:**\n\n**Most Frequently Observed Country Codes**\n\nAs for Twaego (the ‘owner’ of Bablosoft), their profile summary indicates they are from Kiev,\nUkraine.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 8:**\n\n**Twaego User Profile Summary**\n\nWe were able to corroborate this information based on management activity to several\nelements of the Bablosoft infrastructure, sourced from a single Ukrainian-assigned IP\naddress. In addition, the IP was also involved with management connections to a number of\nhosts on TCP/27017 – commonly associated with MongoDB.\n\n**Figure 9:**\n\n**Overview of Bablosoft Backend Infrastructure**\n\n## Malicious Use Cases\n\n\n-----\n\nAs previously highlighted, we observed the Bumblebee, BlackGuard and RedLine C2 IPs\nconnecting to the ‘downloads’ subdomain of bablosoft[.]com, with the assumption that the\noperators were downloading tools for use in threat activities.\n\nFor the BlackGuard and RedLine C2s there are several use cases for BAS which may be\napplicable. For example, we identified a ‘gmail accounts checker’ which the threat actors\nmight utilize for assessing the validity of stolen credentials.\n\n**Figure 10:**\n\n**BAS Gmail Checker Tool**\n\nWhilst examining threat telemetry for other elements of the Bablosoft infrastructure, we\nidentified several hosts associated with cryptojacking malware making connections to\n**_fingerprints.bablosoft[.]com. The Fingerprint element of the BAS service allows users to_**\nalter their browser fingerprint, a function likely used by these particular actors as a means of\nanonymizing or normalizing their activity.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 11:**\n\n**Attribution of Cryptojacking Infrastructure**\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBased on the number of actors already utilizing tools offered on the Bablosoft website, we\ncan only expect to see BAS becoming a more common element of the threat actor’s toolkit.\nAs referenced by F5 Labs in their report on credential stuffing – “One of the reasons we\n_expect to see more of BAS is because of the Bablosoft community and how easy the_\n_software makes it to redistribute and sell work.”._\n\n\n-----\n\nAn unofficial Telegram group, entitled Bablosoft – BAS chat (BABLOSOFT – ЧАТ ПО\nБАСУ), retains a membership of over 1,000 users, further highlighting the level of community\nactivity around the tool. This group appears to be used predominantly by Russian speakers,\nto share updates on new features, scripts and tips.\n\n**Figure 12:**\n\n**Unofficial Bablosoft Telegram Group**\n\n**IOCs**\n\nBumblebee C2:\n\n**45.147.229.177**\n\nBlackGuard Panel C2:\n\n**185.173.157.26**\n\nRedLine Controller C2:\n\n**91.243.59.61**\n\n\n-----",
