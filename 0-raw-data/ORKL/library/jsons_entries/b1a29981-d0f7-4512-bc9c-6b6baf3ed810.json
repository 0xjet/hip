There is no traction among the Anonymous collective in Islamic countries, like during the TurkHackTeam “OpSweden.”\n\n- Their operation is instead amplified in the Russian hacktivism sphere by #Infinity Hackers Group, #KILLNET, and #ANONYMOUS RUSSIA.\n\n- Uses the site check-host[.]net to check the status of their channel, the same as KillNet, Passion Net, and other Russian hacktivist groups.\n\n- The group claims that the “Sudanese help Russia because Russia helped Sudan.”\n\n- Most posts are made in English and Russian, but not Arabic.1\n\n- User location for the Telegram account is listed as Russia.Image 3:Registration Data on the Anonymous Sudan ChannelWhenthe Anonymous Sudan account was first created on Telegram, the group’s only activitywas a short statement that the group would attack “enemies of Sudan” and then a few posts amplifying posts by Russian hacktivist groups KillNet and Anonymous Russia.Below is an example of a post from Anonymous Sudan amplifying a pro-Russian message from KillNet.1Since claims that Anonymous Sudan may be tied to Russia, the actor has apparently begun to update their posts, including adding some Arabic text, in an attempt to disguise the origin. Until recently however all posts have been in English and Russian only.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n2www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/a/EQzrm2/ryska-och-turkiska-hackare-samverkade-efter-koranbranningen\n\n\n-----\n\nhttps://www.secure.instagram.com/p/Cnghb2VDMQ2/6https://thecyberexpress.com/anonymous-sudan-vs-us/\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----",
