However, as the \"bot is\ndead\" they are moving Conti from TrickBot to BazarBackdoor as the primary way of gaining\ninitial access.\n\n“After being “acquired” by Conti, [TrickBot leaders] are now rich in prospects with secure\nground beneath them, and Conti will always find a way to make use of the available talent” [AdvIntel](https://www.advintel.io/post/the-trickbot-saga-s-finale-has-aired-but-a-spinoff-is-already-in-the-works)\n\nEver since its launch, the Conti operation maintained a code of conduct that allowed it to rise\nas one of the most resilient and lucrative ransomware groups, unfazed by law enforcement\ncrackdowns on its competitors.\n\nAdvIntel says that the group was able to run their normal cybercriminal business by adopting\na “trust-based, team-based” model instead of working with random affiliates that would cause\naction from law enforcement due to the organizations they hit.\n\nWhile TrickBot malware detections will become less common, AdvIntel's recent findings\nshow that the operation is not finished and it just moved to a new control group that takes it\nto the next level with malware better suited for high-value targets.\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n[Google exposes tactics of a Conti ransomware access broker](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/google-exposes-tactics-of-a-conti-ransomware-access-broker/)\n\n[New Bumblebee malware replaces Conti's BazarLoader in cyberattacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-bumblebee-malware-replaces-contis-bazarloader-in-cyberattacks/)\n\n[The Week in Ransomware - May 20th 2022 - Another one bites the dust](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-week-in-ransomware-may-20th-2022-another-one-bites-the-dust/)\n\n[Conti ransomware shuts down operation, rebrands into smaller units](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/conti-ransomware-shuts-down-operation-rebrands-into-smaller-units/)\n\n[The Week in Ransomware - May 13th 2022 - A National Emergency](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-week-in-ransomware-may-13th-2022-a-national-emergency/)\n\n[Ionut Ilascu](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/ionut-ilascu/)\n\n\n-----\n\nIonut Ilascu is a technology writer with a focus on all things cybersecurity.
