FireEye assesses that\nAPT32 leverages a unique suite of fully-featured malware, in conjunction with\n\ncommercially-available tools, to conduct targeted operations that are aligned with\n\nVietnamese state interests.\n\n### APT32 and FireEye’s Community Response\n\nIn the course of investigations into intrusions at several corporations with business\n\ninterests in Vietnam, FireEye’s Mandiant incident response consultants uncovered\n\nactivity and attacker-controlled infrastructure indicative of a significant intrusion\n\ncampaign. In March 2017, in response to active targeting of FireEye clients, the team\n[launched a Community Protection Event (CPE) – a coordinated effort between Mandiant](https://www2.fireeye.com/WEB-Community-Protection-Security-Numbers.html)\n\n\n-----\n\np p g q\ntools and phishing lures. This focused intelligence and detection effort led to new\n\nexternal victim identifications as well as providing sufficient technical evidence to link\ntwelve prior intrusions, consolidating four previously unrelated clusters of threat actor\n\nactivity into FireEye’s newest named advanced persistent threat group: APT32.\n\n### APT32 Targeting of Private Sector Company Operations in Southeast Asia\n\nSince at least 2014, FireEye has observed APT32 targeting foreign corporations with a\nvested interest in Vietnam’s manufacturing, consumer products, and hospitality sectors.\n\nFurthermore, there are indications that APT32 actors are targeting peripheral network\nsecurity and technology infrastructure corporations.\n\nHere is an overview of intrusions investigated by FireEye that are attributed to APT32:\n\nIn 2014, a European corporation was compromised prior to constructing a\nmanufacturing facility in Vietnam.\n\nIn 2016, Vietnamese and foreign-owned corporations working in network security,\ntechnology infrastructure, banking, and media industries were targeted.\n\nIn mid-2016, malware that FireEye believes to be unique to APT32 was detected on\nthe networks of a global hospitality industry developer with plans to expand\n\noperations into Vietnam.\nFrom 2016 through 2017, two subsidiaries of U.S. and Philippine consumer products\n\ncorporations, located inside Vietnam, were the target of APT32 intrusion operations.\n\nTable 1 shows a breakdown of APT32 activity, including the malware families used in\neach.\n\nYear Country Industry Malware\n\nNetwork\n2014 Vietnam WINDSHIELD\n\n|Year|Country|Industry|Malware|\n|---|---|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\n|2015|Vietnam|Media|WINDSHIELD|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|2016|Philippines|Consumer products|KOMPROGO WINDSHIELD SOUNDBITE BEACON|\n|2016|Vietnam|Banking|WINDSHIELD|\n|2016|Philippines|Technology Infrastructure|WINDSHIELD|\n|2016|China|Hospitality|WINDSHIELD|\n|2016|Vietnam|Media|WINDSHIELD|\n|2016|United States|Consumer Products|WINDSHIELD PHOREAL BEACON SOUNDBITE|\n\n\nTable 1: APT32 Private Sector Targeting Identified by FireEye\n\n### APT32 Interest in Political Influence and Foreign Governments\n\nIn addition to focused targeting of the private sector with ties to Vietnam, APT32 has\n\n\n-----\n\nj gg g y\ntactics consistent with APT32 operations.\nIn 2014, APT32 leveraged a spear-phishing attachment titled “Plans to crackdown on\nprotesters at the Embassy of Vietnam.exe,\" which targeted dissident activity among\nthe Vietnamese diaspora in Southeast Asia. Also in 2014, APT32 carried out an\n\nintrusion against a Western country’s national legislature.\nIn 2015, SkyEye Labs, the security research division of the Chinese firm Qihoo 360,\n[released a report detailing threat actors that were targeting Chinese public and](http://blogs.360.cn/blog/oceanlotus-apt)\nprivate entities including government agencies, research institutes, maritime\n\nagencies, sea construction, and shipping enterprises. The information included in the\nreport indicated that the perpetrators used the same malware, overlapping\ninfrastructure, and similar targets as APT32.\nIn 2015 and 2016, two Vietnamese media outlets were targeted with malware that\nFireEye assesses to be unique to APT32.\n\nIn 2017, social engineering content in lures used by the actor provided evidence that\nthey were likely used to target members of the Vietnam diaspora in Australia as well\nas government employees in the Philippines.\n\n### APT32 Tactics\n\nIn their current campaign, APT32 has leveraged ActiveMime files that employ social\n\nengineering methods to entice the victim into enabling macros. Upon execution, the\ninitialized file downloads multiple malicious payloads from remote servers. APT32 actors\ncontinue to deliver the malicious attachments via spear-phishing emails.\n\nAPT32 actors designed multilingual lure documents which were tailored to specific\nvictims. Although the files had “.doc” file extensions, the recovered phishing lures were\nActiveMime “.mht” web page archives that contained text and images. These files were\n\nlikely created by exporting Word documents into single file web pages.\n\nTable 2 contains a sample of recovered APT32 multilingual lure files.\n\nActiveMime Lure Files MD5\n\n\n-----\n\n|告.doc (2017 Statistical Report on Staff Salary and Allowances)|5458a2e4d784abb1a1127263bd5006b5|\n|---|---|\n|Thong tin.doc (Information)|ce50e544430e7265a45fab5a1f31e529|\n|Phan Vu Tutn CV.doc|4f761095ca51bfbbf4496a4964e41d4f|\n|Ke hoach cuu tro nam 2017.doc (2017 Bailout Plan)|e9abe54162ba4572c770ab043f576784|\n|Instructions to GSIS.doc|fba089444c769700e47c6b44c362f96b|\n|Hoi thao truyen thong doc lap.doc (Traditional Games)|f6ee4b72d6d42d0c7be9172be2b817c1|\n|Giấy yêu cầu bồi thường mới 2016 - hằng.doc (New 2016 Claim Form)|aa1f85de3e4d33f31b4f78968b29f175|\n|Hoa don chi tiet tien no.doc (Debt Details)|5180a8d9325a417f2d8066f9226a5154|\n|Thu moi tham du Hoi luan.doc (Collection of Participants)|f6ee4b72d6d42d0c7be9172be2b817c1|\n|Danh sach nhan vien vi pham ky luat.doc (List of Employee Violations)|6baafffa7bf960dec821b627f9653e44|\n\n\nNội-dung-quả ng-cá o.doc\n(Internal Content Advertising)\n\n\n471a2e7341f2614b715dc89e803ffcac\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Base64 encoded ActiveMime data also contained an OLE file with malicious macros.\nWhen opened, many lure files displayed fake error messages in an attempt to trick users\ninto launching the malicious macros. Figure 1 shows a fake Gmail-theme paired with a\nhexadecimal error code that encourages the recipient to enable content to resolve the\n\nerror. Figure 2 displays another APT32 lure that used a convincing image of a fake\nWindows error message instructing the recipient to enable content to properly display\ndocument font characters.\n\nFigure 1: Example APT32 Phishing Lure – Fake Gmail Error Message\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2: Example APT32 Phishing Lure – Fake Text Encoding Error Message\n\nAPT32 operators implemented several novel techniques to track the efficacy of their\nphishing, monitor the distribution of their malicious documents, and establish persistence\n\nmechanisms to dynamically update backdoors injected into memory.\n\nIn order to track who opened the phishing emails, viewed the links, and downloaded the\nattachments in real-time, APT32 used cloud-based email analytics software designed for\nsales organizations. In some instances, APT32 abandoned direct email attachments\naltogether and relied exclusively on this tracking technique with links to their\nActiveMime lures hosted externally on legitimate cloud storage services.\n\nTo enhance visibility into the further distribution of their phishing lures, APT32 utilized\nthe native web page functionality of their ActiveMime documents to link to external\nimages hosted on APT32 monitored infrastructure.\n\nFigure 3 contains an example phishing lure with HTML image tags used for additional\ntracking by APT32.\n\nFigure 3: Phishing Lure Containing HTML Image Tags for Additional Tracking\n\n\n-----\n\nwith email tracking software, APT32 was able to closely track phishing delivery, success\n\nrate, and conduct further analysis about victim organizations while monitoring the\ninterest of security firms.\n\nOnce macros were enabled on the target system, the malicious macros created two\nnamed scheduled tasks as persistence mechanisms for two backdoors on the infected\nsystem. The first named scheduled task launched an application whitelisting script\n\nprotection bypass to execute a COM scriptlet that dynamically downloaded the first\nbackdoor from APT32’s infrastructure and injected it into memory. The second named\n\nscheduled task, loaded as an XML file to falsify task attributes, ran a JavaScript code\nblock that downloaded and launched a secondary backdoor, delivered as a multi-stage\n\nPowerShell script. In most lures, one scheduled task persisted an APT32-specific\n\nbackdoor and the other scheduled task initialized a commercially-available backdoor as\nbackup.\n\nTo illustrate the complexity of these lures, Figure 4 shows the creation of persistence\n\nmechanisms for recovered APT32 lure “2017年员工工资性津贴额统计报告.doc”.\n\nFigure 4: APT32 ActiveMime Lures Create Two Named Scheduled Tasks\n\nIn this example, a scheduled task named “Windows Scheduled Maintenance” was created\n[to run Casey Smith’s “Squiblydoo” App Whitelisting bypass every 30 minutes. While all](http://subt0x10.blogspot.com/2016/04/bypass-application-whitelisting-script.html)\n\npayloads can be dynamically updated, at the time of delivery, this task launched a COM\n\nscriptlet (“.sct” file extension) that downloaded and executed Meterpreter hosted on\nimages.chinabytes[.]info. Meterpreter then loaded Cobalt Strike BEACON, configured to\n\n[communicate with 80.255.3[.]87 using the Safebrowsing malleable C2 profile to further](https://github.com/rsmudge/Malleable-C2-Profiles/blob/master/normal/safebrowsing.profile)\nbl d i ith t k t ffi A d h d l d t k d “S h d l d D f ”\n\n\n-----\n\ncommunicate with the domains blog.panggin[.]org, share.codehao[.]net, and\n\nyii.yiihao126[.]net.\n\nFigure 5 illustrates the chain of events for a single successful APT32 phishing lure that\n\ndynamically injects two multi-stage malware frameworks into memory.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5: APT32 Phishing Chain of Events\n\nThe impressive APT32 operations did not stop after they established a foothold in victim\n\nenvironments. Several Mandiant investigations revealed that, after gaining access,\nAPT32 regularly cleared select event log entries and heavily obfuscated their\n\nPowerShell-based tools and shellcode loaders with Daniel Bohannon’s InvokeObfuscation framework.\n\nAPT32 regularly used stealthy techniques to blend in with legitimate user activity:\n\nDuring one investigation, APT32 was observed using a privilege escalation exploit\n(CVE-2016-7255) masquerading as a Windows hotfix.\n\nIn another investigation, APT32 compromised the McAfee ePO infrastructure to\ndistribute their malware as a software deployment task in which all systems pulled\n\nthe payload from the ePO server using the proprietary SPIPE protocol.\n\nAPT32 also used hidden or non-printing characters to help visually camouflage their\nmalware on a system. For example, APT32 installed one backdoor as a persistent\n\nservice with a legitimate service name that had a Unicode no-break space character\nappended to it Another backdoor used an otherwise legitimate DLL filename\n\n\n-----\n\nAPT32 appears to have a well-resourced development capability and uses a custom suite\n\nof backdoors spanning multiple protocols. APT32 operations are characterized through\ndeployment of signature malware payloads including WINDSHIELD, KOMPROGO,\n\nSOUNDBITE, and PHOREAL. APT32 often deploys these backdoors along with the\ncommercially-available Cobalt Strike BEACON backdoor. APT32 may also possess\n\n[backdoor development capabilities for macOS.](https://www.alienvault.com/blogs/labs-research/oceanlotus-for-os-x-an-application-bundle-pretending-to-be-an-adobe-flash-update)\n\nThe capabilities for this unique suite of malware is shown in Table 3.\n\nMalware Capabilities\n\nCommand and control (C2)\n\ncommunications via TCP raw sockets\nFour configured C2s and six configured\n\nports – randomly-chosen C2/port for\ncommunications\n\nRegistry manipulation\n\nGet the current module's file name\nGather system information including\n\nWINDSHIELD registry values, user name, computer\n\nname, and current code page\n\nFile system interaction including\ndirectory creation, file deletion, reading,\n\nand writing files\nLoad additional modules and execute\n\ncode\n\nTerminate processes\nAnti-disassembly\n\nFully-featured backdoor capable of\n\nprocess file and registry management\n\n|Malware|Capabilities|\n|---|---|\n|WINDSHIELD|Command and control (C2) communications via TCP raw sockets Four configured C2s and six configured ports – randomly-chosen C2/port for communications Registry manipulation Get the current module's file name Gather system information including registry values, user name, computer name, and current code page File system interaction including directory creation, file deletion, reading, and writing files Load additional modules and execute code Terminate processes Anti-disassembly|\n\n\n-----\n\n|Col1|Retrieving information about the|\n|---|---|\n||infected system|\n|SOUNDBITE|C2 communications via DNS Process creation File upload Shell command execution File and directory enumeration/manipulation Window enumeration Registry manipulation System information gathering|\n|PHOREAL|C2 communications via ICMP Reverse shell creation Filesystem manipulation Registry manipulation Process creation File upload|\n\n\nBEACON (Cobalt\nStrike)\n\n\nPublicly available payload that can\ninject and execute arbitrary code into\n\nprocesses\nImpersonating the security context of\n\nusers\nImporting Kerberos tickets\n\nUploading and downloading files\nExecuting shell commands\n\nConfigured with malleable C2 profiles\n\nto blend in with normal network traffic\nCo-deployment and interoperability\n\n\n-----\n\nTable 3: APT32 Malware and Capabilities\n\nAPT32 operators appear to be well-resourced and supported as they use a large set of\n\ndomains and IP addresses as command and control infrastructure. The FireEye iSIGHT\n\nIntelligence MySIGHT Portal contains additional information on these backdoor families\nbased on Mandiant investigations of APT32 intrusions.\n\nFigure 6 provides a summary of APT32 tools and techniques mapped to each stage of\n\nthe attack lifecycle.\n\nFigure 6: APT32 Attack Lifecycle\n\n### Outlook and Implications\n\nBased on incident response investigations, product detections, and intelligence\n\nobservations along with additional publications on the same operators, FireEye assesses\nthat APT32 is a cyber espionage group aligned with Vietnamese government interests.\n\nThe targeting of private sector interests by APT32 is notable and FireEye believes the\n\n\n-----\n\nultimately erode the competitive advantage of targeted organizations. Furthermore,\nAPT32 continues to threaten political activism and free speech in Southeast Asia and the\n\npublic sector worldwide. Governments, journalists, and members of the Vietnam\ndiaspora may continue to be targeted.\n\nWhile actors from China, Iran, Russia, and North Korea remain the most active cyber\n\nespionage threats tracked and responded to by FireEye, APT32 reflects a growing host\n\nof new countries that have adopted this dynamic capability. APT32 demonstrates how\naccessible and impactful offensive capabilities can be with the proper investment and\n\nthe flexibility to embrace newly-available tools and techniques. As more countries utilize\ninexpensive and efficient cyber operations, there is a need for public awareness of these\n\nthreats and renewed dialogue around emerging nation-state intrusions that go beyond\npublic sector and intelligence targets.\n\n### APT32 Detection\n\nFigure 7 contains a Yara rule can be used to identify malicious macros associated with\nAPT32’s phishing lures:\n\n\n-----\n\nTable 4 contains a sampling of the infrastructure that FireEye has associated with APT32\nC2.\n\nC2 Infrastructure\n\n103.53.197.202 104.237.218.70 104.237.218.72\n\n185.157.79.3 193.169.245.78 193.169.245.137\n\n23.227.196.210 24.datatimes.org 80.255.3.87\n\nblog.docksugs.org blog.panggin.org contay.deaftone.com\n\ncheck.paidprefund.org datatimes.org docksugs.org\n\neconomy.bloghop.org emp.gapte.name facebook-cdn.net\n\ngap-facebook.com gl-appspot.org help.checkonl.org\n\nhigh.expbas.net high.vphelp.net icon.torrentart.com\n\nimages.chinabytes.info imaps.qki6.com img.fanspeed.net\n\njob.supperpow.com lighpress.info menmin.strezf.com\n\nmobile.pagmobiles.info news.lighpress.info notificeva.com\n\n|C2 Infrastructure|Col2|Col3|\n|---|---|---|\n|103.53.197.202|104.237.218.70|104.237.218.72|\n|185.157.79.3|193.169.245.78|193.169.245.137|\n|23.227.196.210|24.datatimes.org|80.255.3.87|\n|blog.docksugs.org|blog.panggin.org|contay.deaftone.com|\n|check.paidprefund.org|datatimes.org|docksugs.org|\n|economy.bloghop.org|emp.gapte.name|facebook-cdn.net|\n|gap-facebook.com|gl-appspot.org|help.checkonl.org|\n|high.expbas.net|high.vphelp.net|icon.torrentart.com|\n|images.chinabytes.info|imaps.qki6.com|img.fanspeed.net|\n|job.supperpow.com|lighpress.info|menmin.strezf.com|\n\n\n-----\n\np g g g g\n\nseri.volveri.net ssl.zin0.com static.jg7.org\n\nsyn.timeizu.net teriava.com timeizu.net\n\ntonholding.com tulationeva.com untitled.po9z.com\n\nupdate-flashs.com vieweva.com volveri.net\n\nvphelp.net yii.yiihao126.net zone.apize.net\n\nTable 4: Sampling of APT32 C2 Infrastructure\n\n[This entry was posted on Sun May 14 18:00 EDT 2017 and filed under Nick Carr, Attack,](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research.html/category/etc/tags/fireeye-blog-authors/nick-carr)\n\n[Malware, and APT.](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research.html/category/etc/tags/fireeye-blog-tags/malware)\n\n|seri.volveri.net|ssl.zin0.com|static.jg7.org|\n|---|---|---|\n|syn.timeizu.net|teriava.com|timeizu.net|\n|tonholding.com|tulationeva.com|untitled.po9z.com|\n|update-flashs.com|vieweva.com|volveri.net|\n|vphelp.net|yii.yiihao126.net|zone.apize.net|\n\n\n-----\n\n## Sign up for email updates\n\nGet information and insight on\ntoday's advanced threats from the\n\nleader in advanced threat\n\nprevention.\n\nFirst Name Last Name\n\nEmail Address\n\nCompany Name\n\nExecutive Perspective\nBlog\n\nThreat Research Blog\n\nProducts and Services\nBlog\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\n\n-----\n\n[About FireEye](https://www.fireeye.com/company/why-fireeye.html)\n\n[Customer Stories](https://www.fireeye.com/customers.html)\n\n[Careers](https://www.fireeye.com/company/jobs.html)\n\n[Partners](https://www.fireeye.com/partners.html)\n\n[Investor Relations](http://investors.fireeye.com/)\n\n[Supplier Documents](https://www.fireeye.com/company/supplier.html)\n\n\n[Newsroom](https://www.fireeye.com/company/newsroom.html)\n\n[Press Releases](https://www.fireeye.com/company/press-releases.html)\n\n[Webinars](https://www.fireeye.com/company/webinars.html)\n\n[Events](https://www.fireeye.com/company/events.html)\n\n[Awards and Honors](https://www.fireeye.com/company/awards.html)\n\n[Email Preferences](https://www2.fireeye.com/manage-your-preferences.html)\n\n\n[Incident?](https://www.fireeye.com/company/incident-response.html)\n\n[Report Security Issue](https://www.fireeye.com/company/security.html)\n\n[Contact Support](https://www.fireeye.com/support/contacts.html)\n\n[Customer Portal](https://csportal.fireeye.com/secur/login_portal.jsp?orgId=00D3000000063LS&portalId=06030000000pSNE)\n\n[Communities](https://community.fireeye.com/welcome)\n\n[Documentation Portal](https://docs.fireeye.com)\n\n\n[Threat Reseach](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research.html)\n\n[Products and Services](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/products-and-services.html)\n\n[Executive Perspectives](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/executive-perspective.html)\n\nThreat Map\n\n[View the Latest Threats](https://www.fireeye.com/cyber-map/threat-map.html)\n\n\n1 877 347 3393\n\nStay Connected\n\n## \n\n\nCopyright © 2018 FireEye, Inc.
