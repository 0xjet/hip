This\nannouncement continues the parade of devastating memory-space exploits including\n[EternalBlue and](https://businessinsights.bitdefender.com/hypervisor-introspection-defeated-enternalblue-a-priori?hsLang=en-us) [BlueKeep.](https://businessinsights.bitdefender.com/bluekeep-exploit-code-released-blocked-by-hypervisor-introspection?hsLang=en-us)\n\nSecurity Advisory ADV200001 | Microsoft Guidance on Scripting Engine Memory Corruption\nVulnerability\n\nCVE-2020-0674 is a recently discovered browser vulnerability in the Microsoft scripting\nengine that allows for remote code execution (RCE) on Internet Explorer browsers from\nmalicious JavaScript (.js) files. The exploit carries Microsoft’s highest severity rating of\n\n\n-----\n\nCritical and it affects Internet Explorer versions 9, 10, and 11.\n\n[Microsoft, DHS Warn of Zero-Day Attack Targeting IE Users](https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities---threats/microsoft-dhs-warn-of-zero-day-attack-targeting-ie-users/d/d-id/1336851)\n\nBitdefender has confirmed that this critical vulnerability is being actively exploited in the wild.\nSecurity researchers in Bitdefender Labs have obtained and analyzed multiple samples to\nexplore its tactics, techniques, and procedures. We have independently verified that 2\ndistinct executable payloads are unleashed by the exploit and currently in circulation:\n\n[785a48daa5d6d3d1abbc91eeecf9943a0fa402084cea4e66e6c2e72c76107b86](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/785a48daa5d6d3d1abbc91eeecf9943a0fa402084cea4e66e6c2e72c76107b86/detection)\n[53f213309adce8b2bab567a16fd1bb71cc1199c65ac384345d0877ad1e9798a2](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/53f213309adce8b2bab567a16fd1bb71cc1199c65ac384345d0877ad1e9798a2/detection)\n\nBelow are Bitdefender’s analysis and key findings concerning the exploitation of CVE-20200674 in the wild. We also demonstrate the successful detection and defeat of this dangerous\nexploit in virtual datacenter systems protected by Bitdefender Hypervisor Introspection (HVI)\n—including standard desktops, servers, and VDI desktops. HVI prevents this type of exploit,\nclosing the gap between the time exploit code is used in the wild and the time the systems\nare patched.\n\n_Hypervisor Introspection intercepts and denies the attempt to access and overwrite protected_\n_memory areas._\n\n\n-----\n\nInstead of scanning millions of malware samples, Bitdefender Hypervisor Introspection\ndetects all known memory attack techniques—few in number and only visible at the\nhypervisor level—identifying advanced and zero-day attacks as easily as any known exploit,\npreventing the malicious behavior from executing. HVI requires no signature updates, since\nthe common attack techniques remain relatively constant, even as the tools and procedures\n[change with each specific attack. Bitdefender Labs maintains constant vigilance, keeping](https://labs.bitdefender.com/)\npace with new techniques and adding them to HVI’s detection stack.\n\nBitdefender Hypervisor Introspection | Stop Advanced Targeted Attacks and Prevent\nBreaches\n\n**Key Findings**\n\n1. Malicious URLs from phishing links contain multiple JavaScripts, each operating on a\n\ndifferent version of Windows to exploit CVE-2020-0674\n\n1. When the RCE memory-space exploit is successful, the scripts download and run two\n\ndistinct executable files in memory with the privileges of the logged-in user\n\n1. The attack attempts to access a protected memory area, to write data to read-only\n\nmemory, and to execute arbitrary code from a non-executable area such the heap\nstack or process stack\n\nWatch Video At:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/HQvWgu1H8rY\n\n[Impact of Virtualization Security on Your VDI Environment White Paper](https://businessresources.bitdefender.com/white-paper-impact-of-virtualization-security-on-vdi?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D53397196458516633242084807775356394450%7CMCORGID%3D0E920C0F53DA9E9B0A490D45%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1571268674&hsLang=en-us)\n\n**Conclusions**\n\n\n-----\n\nHypervisor Introspection is essential in the virtual datacenter, where built-in protection\nagainst new memory exploits and other advanced attacks using well-known exploit\ntechniques cannot come at the expense of VM efficiency, density, or performance. Don’t rely\non vendor software patches to keep you safe, as the attackers will always be one step\nahead. Instead, proactively take away their operating space with HVI and set your defenses\non the high ground of memory space. Bitdefender has demonstrated proactive prevention of\n[memory vulnerabilities and exploits time and again—from EternalBlue to](https://businessinsights.bitdefender.com/hypervisor-introspection-defeated-enternalblue-a-priori?hsLang=en-us) [BlueKeep and more](https://businessinsights.bitdefender.com/bluekeep-exploit-code-released-blocked-by-hypervisor-introspection?hsLang=en-us)\n—proving that proactive defense with denial is always better than reactive detection.\n\n[For further information on Bitdefender Hypervisor Introspection, please download our](https://www.bitdefender.com/business/enterprise-products/hypervisor-introspection.html?cid=blog%7Cb%7Chubspot%7Ccve-2020-0674)\n[datasheet or contact us](https://download.bitdefender.com/resources/media/materials/hypervisor-introspection/en/Bitdefender-Spearhead-Datasheet-HVI-A4-en_EN-v2017-print.pdf?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D75232358847128348543750170813579057834%7CMCORGID%3D0E920C0F53DA9E9B0A490D45%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1580947036) [here.](https://www.bitdefender.com/business/inquire/?cid=blog%7Cb%7Chubspot%7Ccve-2020-0674)\n\n\n-----",
