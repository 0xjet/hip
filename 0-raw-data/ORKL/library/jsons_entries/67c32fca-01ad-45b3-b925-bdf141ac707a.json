    "plain_text": "# OPERATION HANGOVER |Executive Summary\n\n## Unveiling an Indian Cyberattack Infrastructure\n\n### This report details a sophisticated cyberattack infrastructure that appears to originate from India,\n\n conducted by private threat actors with no evidence of state-sponsorship. It has likely been in\n\n operation for over three years, primarily as a platform for surveillance against targets of national\n\n security interest that are mostly based in Pakistan and possibly in the United States. It is also\n\n used for industrial espionage against the Norwegian telecom corporation Telenor and other civil\n ian corporations. Evidence points to professional project management and outsourcing of key\n\n tasks, including some by freelance programmers.\n\n On March 17, 2013 a Norwegian newspaper reported that the country’s telecommunications giant\n\n Telenor had filed a criminal police case for an unlawful computer intrusion. Spear phishing\n\n emails targeting upper management appeared to be the source of the infection\n\n Through extensive analysis, security analysts at Norman Shark in conjunction with our partners,\n\n quickly uncovered a previously unknown and sophisticated infrastructure for targeted attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Cybe a ac Objec_ _es_\nThe primary purpose of this long-running, global command-and-control network appears to be surveillance against national security interests. Privatesector industrial espionage in fields as diverse as natural resources, telecommunications, law, food & restaurants, and manufacturing is likely a secondary purpose of this network.\n\n_Target Selection_\nBased on analysis of IP addresses collected from criminal data stores discovered during the investigation, it appears that potential victims have been targeted in over a dozen countries, most heavily represented by Pakistan, Iran, and the\nUnited States. Targets include government, military, and civilian organizations\n\n_Highly-Targeted Social Engineering Tactics_\nSpear phishing to carefully-selected target individuals was the primary attack\nvector identified in the investigation. The attackers went to great lengths to\nmake the social engineering aspects of the attack appear as credible and applicable as possible.\n\nIn many cases, decoy files and websites were used, specifically geared to the\nparticular sensibilities of regional targets including cultural and religious subject matter. Victims would click on what appeared to be an interesting document, and begin the long-running infection cycle.\n\n_Exploit Tools and Techniques_\nDespite all of the recent media attention on so-called “zero-day” exploits encompassing brand new, never-before-seen attack methods, Operation Hangover\nappears to have relied exclusively upon well-known, previously identified vulnerabilities in Java, Word documents, and web browsers.\n\nFavored methods include documents infected with malicious code, along with\ndirection to malicious websites with names deliberately similar to legitimate\ngovernment, entertainment, security related, and commercial sites. Often the\nuser would be presented with a legitimate document or software download they\nwere expecting to see, along with an unseen malicious download.\n\n_Infrastructure Development_\nOperation Hangover utilizes a very extensive and sophisticated command-andcontrol infrastructure, likely developed over many months or years by numerous developers. Our investigation revealed evidence of professional project\nmanagement practices used to design frameworks, modules, and subcomponents. Individual malware authors were assigned certain tasks, and components were “outsourced” to what appear to be freelance programmers.\n\n_Attribution of Responsibility_\nIn recent months, much focus has been on China – including both statesponsored and individual actors – but Operation Hangover contains notable\nhallmarks of originating exclusively in India. We base this attribution with a\nvery high degree of confidence on our extensive analysis of IP addresses, website domain registrations, and text-based identifiers contained within the malicious code itself. All indications point to private syndicates of threat actors\nfollowing their own motivations, with no direct evidence of state-sponsorship\nby the Indian government or by any other nation.\n\n\n### ATTACK OVERVIEW\n\n                 - · ·\n\nDiscovery of a security breach at\nNorway-based Telenor uncovered a\nlong running, sophisticated global\ncyberattack infrastructure that likely\ncontinues to this day.\n\n**Cyberattack Objectives**\n\n  - National security interests\n\n  - Industrial espionage\n\n**Target Selection**\n\n  - Primarily Pakistani and US-based\n\ntargets\n\n  - Business targets\n\n**Highly-Targeted Social Engineer-**\n**ing Tactics**\n\n  - Executables disguised as docu\nments\n\n  - Malicious web downloads\n\n**Exploit Tools and Techniques**\n\n  - Known vulnerabilities only\n\n  - No use of zero-day exploits\n\n**Infrastructure Development**\n\n  - Evidence of professional project\n\nmanagement\n\n  - Outsourcing of development\n\n**Attribution of Responsibility**\n\n  - Individual actors likely based in\n\nIndia\n\n  - Private data security firms hired\n\nto build specific infrastructure\ncomponents\n\n  - No evidence of state-sponsored\n\nactivity\n\n\n**Contact information:**\n\nGary Thompson, 925.768.2400\nTim Johnson, 415.385.9537\n[norman@claritycommunications.us](mailto:norman@claritycommunications.us)\n\n\n-----",
