In recent months, the [mysterious group has been releasing hacking](https://www.pcworld.com/article/3108531/security/suspected-spycraft-not-hacktivism-swirls-around-alleged-nsa-hack.html)\ntools allegedly taken from the NSA, and security researchers say they actually work.\n\nFriday’s leak includes an archive describing the internal architecture at EastNets, a Dubaibased anti-money laundering company that also offers services related to SWIFT, the\nfinancial banking network.\n\nThe leaked files show the NSA was allegedly targeting EastNets in Dubai, Belgium, and\nEgypt.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Among the documents is a PowerPoint presentation designated as top secret. It mentions](https://github.com/DonnchaC/shadowbrokers-exploits/blob/master/swift/JFM_Status.pptx)\n“ongoing collection” from servers owned by financial institutions in the United Arab Emirates,\nYemen, Kuwait, Palestine, and Bahrain.\n\nThe files appear to include logs from 2013 that show the NSA was also targeting oil and\ninvestment companies across the Middle East.\n\nIf the files are real, the exposed information represents a threat to the SWIFT network, said\nMatt Suiche, founder of security firm Comae Technologies, who has been looking over the\nleaked files.\n\nShadow brokers\nA slide from a powerpoint presentation allegedly taken from the NSA.\n\n“This is the first time to date that so much information had been published on how a SWIFT\n[Service Bureau actually works and its internal infrastructure,” he wrote in a blog post.](https://medium.com/@msuiche/the-nsa-compromised-swift-network-50ec3000b195)\n\nHowever, EastNets [called reports that it had been hacked “totally false and unfounded.” The](http://www.eastnets.com/News_Details/17-04-14/No_credibility_to_the_online_claim_of_a_compromise_of_EastNets_customer_information_on_its_SWIFT_service_bureau.aspx)\ncompany has checked its servers and found no compromise or any vulnerabilities.\n\n“The photos shown on Twitter, claiming compromised information, is about pages that are\noutdated and obsolete, generated on a low-level internal server that is retired since 2013,”\nthe company said in a statement.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe group behind the leak, the Shadow Brokers, didn t clearly explain why they dumped the\nfiles. But in addition to the documents, the hackers also released what appears to be an\narsenal of Windows-based hacking tools -- some of which target previously unknown\nvulnerabilities.\n\n[“This isn't a data dump, this is a damn Microsoft apocalypse,” tweeted a security researcher](https://twitter.com/hackerfantastic/status/852922058707263489)\nwho goes by the name Hacker Fantastic.\n\nResearchers are still pouring over the leaked documents, but they’ve noticed the tools target\nWindows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows 7 and 8, among other software products such\nas Lotus Notes, now called IBM Notes. Any hackers can now download the tools and learn\nfrom them.\n\nOn Friday, Microsoft also said it was still studying the leak, and it “will take the necessary\nactions to protect our customers.”\n\nIn a short [posting written in broken English, the Shadow Brokers warned on Friday they had](https://steemit.com/shadowbrokers/@theshadowbrokers/lost-in-translation)\nmore files to dump.\n\n[Earlier this month, the group reappeared after a hiatus and wrote a blog post criticizing U.S.](https://medium.com/@shadowbrokerss/dont-forget-your-base-867d304a94b1)\nPresident Donald Trump for ordering an airstrike in Syria and “abandoning” his voters.\n\n“Maybe if all surviving WWIII, theshadowbrokers be seeing you next week,” the group wrote\non Friday.\n\nSecurity researchers say the group’s latest leak is the most damaging one to date. “It's a\n[huge slap on the face of NSA,” said Bulgarian antivirus expert Vesselin Bontchev in an email.](https://bontchev.nlcv.bas.bg/)\n\n_[Tell us what you think.
