In its most recent campaign from late](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0040/)\n\nNovember to early December 2021, Patchwork has used malicious RTF files to drop a variant of the BADNEWS (Ragnatela) Remote Administration Trojan (RAT).\n\nWhat is interesting among victims of this latest campaign, is that the actor has for the first time targeted several faculty members whose research focus is on molecular\n\nmedicine and biological science.\n\nInstead of focusing entirely on victimology, we decided to shade some light on this APT. Ironically, all the information we gathered was possible thanks to the threat actor\n\ninfecting themselves with their own RAT, resulting in captured keystrokes and screenshots of their own computer and virtual machines.\n\n### Ragnatela\n\nWe identified what we believe is a new variant of the BADNEWS RAT called Ragnatela being distributed via spear phishing emails to targets of interest in Pakistan.\n\nRagnatela, which means spider web in Italian, is also the project name and panel used by Patchwork APT.\n\n\n-----\n\n### (/)\n\n\nWe use cookies to help us enhance your online experience.

If that sounds good, click “Accept All Cookies” or\n\n\nFigure 1: Patchwork’s Ragnatela panel\n\nRagnatela RAT was built sometime in late November as seen in its Program Database (PDB) path “E:\\new_ops\\jlitest __change_ops -29no – Copy\\Release\\jlitest.pdb”. It\n\nfeatures the following capabilities:\n\nExecuting commands via cmd\n\nCapturing screenshots\n\nLogging Keystrokes\n\nCollecting list of all the files in victim’s machine\n\nCollecting list of the running applications in the victim’s machine at a specific time periods\n\nDowning addition payloads\n\nUploading files\n\nFigure 2: Ragnatela commands\n\nIn order to distribute the RAT onto victims, Patchwork lures them with documents impersonating Pakistani authorities. For example, a document called EOIForm.rtf was\n\nuploaded by the threat actor onto their own server at karachidha[.]org/docs/.\n\n\n-----\n\n### (/)\n\n\nWe use cookies to help us enhance your online experience.

We can deduce the file was created on December 9 2021 based on the source path information.\n\n\n-----\n\n### (/)\n\n\nWe use cookies to help us enhance your online experience.

We can see them running both\n\nVirtualBox and VMware to do web development and testing. Their main host has dual keyboard layouts (English and Indian).\n\nFigure 9: Virtual machine running on top of threat actor’s main computer\n\nOther information that can be obtained is that the weather at the time was cloudy with 19 degrees and that they haven’t updated their Java yet. On a more serious note, the\n\nthreat actor uses VPN Secure and CyberGhost to mask their IP address.\n\n\n-----\n\n### (/)\n\n\nWe use cookies to help us enhance your online experience.

While they continue to use the same lures and RAT, the group has shown interest in a new kind\n\nof target. Indeed this is the first time we have observed Patchwork targeting molecular medicine and biological science researchers.\n\nThanks to data captured by the threat actor’s own malware, we were able to get a better understanding about who sits behind the keyboard. The group makes use of virtual\n\nmachines and VPNs to both develop, push updates and check on their victims. Patchwork, like some other East Asian APTs is not as sophisticated as their Russian and\n\nNorth Korean counterparts.\n\n### Indicators of Compromise\n\nLure\n\nkarachidha[.]org/docs/EOIForm.rtf\n\n5b5b1608e6736c7759b1ecf61e756794cf9ef3bb4752c315527bcc675480b6c6\n\nRAT\n\njli.dll\n\n3d3598d32a75fd80c9ba965f000639024e4ea1363188f44c5d3d6d6718aaa1a3\n\nC2\n\nbgre[.]kozow[.]com\n\nRelated\n\n\nAPT36 jumps on the coronavirus bandwagon,\ndelivers Crimson RAT\n\nMarch 16, 2020\nIn \"Threat analysis\"\n\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE\n\n\nAPTs and COVID-19: How advanced persistent\nthreats use the coronavirus as a lure\n\nApril 9, 2020\nIn \"Threat analysis\"\n\n\n[LazyScripter: From Empire to double RAT](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/malwarebytes-news/2021/02/lazyscripter-from-empire-to-double-rat/)\n\nFebruary 24, 2021\nIn \"Malwarebytes news\"\n\n\n-----\n\n### (/)\n\n\nWe use cookies to help us enhance your online experience.
