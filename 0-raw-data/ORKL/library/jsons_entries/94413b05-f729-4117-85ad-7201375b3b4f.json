Earlier this year, the activities of\nthe Lazarus group in South Korea were discussed and analyzed, as they managed to\n[compromise accounts on various South Korean cryptocurrency exchanges. More recently,](https://www.coindesk.com/report-north-korea-targets-south-koreas-bitcoin-exchanges-cyber-attacks/)\n[they were seen targeting a United Kingdom-based cryptocurrency exchange. In this blog, we](http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/66780/apt/lazarus-apt-cryptocurrency.html)\nwill show and explain our analysis of the infrastructure used in the cyber attack described in\nthe Proofpoint report.\n\n## The Start: Lazarus Group's IDN Phishing for Infections\n\nIn early November, Proofpoint uncovered a large active phishing campaign that sent out\nmessages about fake Bitcoin Gold (BTG) wallet software. The actors abused IDN registration\nattempting to impersonate the official bitcoingold.org website using sender IDN domains and\n\n\n-----\n\nthe decoded notations. Below are four examples of domain names registered for this\ncampaign:\n\n**IDN version** **Decoded version**\n\nxn--bitcoingod-8yb.com bitcoingou013ed.com\n\nxn--bitcoigold-o1b.com bitcoiu0146gold.com\n\nxn--bitcoingld-lcb.org bitcoingu00f6ld.org\n\nxn--bitcingold-hcb.org bitcu00f6ingold.org\n\nThe domains shown above appeared in our crawl data, meaning we had a full copy of the\nwebpage and any metadata present on it. We’ll take a look at xn--bitcingold-hcb.org which, in\nour data, looked identical to the genuine site:\n\nAbove, the fake page set up by the Lazarus group is on the left. Note the download button\nand pushed down ‘Roadmap button,' which do not appear on the official site on the right,\nwhich has a logo and roadmap button instead. The actors copied the index page from the\nofficial Bitcoingold website and modified it, but they still link to the CSS, Javascript, and\nimage resources of the official website, which we can see in the source of the page:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe information above is really valuable to our investigation. As RiskIQ stores host pairs for\nsites that point to each other in a parent or child relationship. We can call upon this data set\nfor the official Bitcoingold website and see at least two of the fake websites in its parent Host\nPair set:\n\n**Note: We filtered on parent relationships to see hosts that pointed to bitcoingold.org, not**\n_hosts bitcoingold linked to itself._\n\nAs reported by Proofpoint, the \"download\" button linked to a backdoored PyInstaller\ninstallation that was set up to download a version of the PowerRatankba implant. The button\nwas linked via an onclick event to a JavaScript function:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe invoked script redirects the user to the file download:\n\nThe file downloaded here was seen with the following SHA256 hash:\n_eab612e333baaec0709f3f213f73388607e495d8af9a2851f352481e996283f1_\n\nBesides Bitcoingold, the Lazarus group performed the same kind of IDN ‘attack’ against the\nElectrum Bitcoin wallet website. The actors created the IDN website, xn--electrm-s2a.org, to\nserve as a fake software installation page similar to the Bitcoingold clone:\n\n\n-----\n\nInterestingly, Lazarus left some information in the source of the page that shows that they\nused the ‘HTTrack’ website copier tool, as well as the date (Friday, November 17th at\n03:27:29 GMT as per our crawl data) they copied the Electrum website:\n\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusions\n\nDefenders with access to internet data collected by crawlers can detect unknown threats at\nthe source and track how they change and spread. Correlating threat data extracted from a\nbroad set of data sources across channels reveals the risk posed to an organization by a\nsingle piece of infrastructure—and how it’s used within a broader context. As can be seen\nfrom the above analysis, RiskIQ’s crawling infrastructure, indexed web data sets, and\nanalyst-focused analysis platform allows organizations to quickly and effectively identify the\nscale of these strategic compromises and provide visibility that improves an organization’s\nability to defend their network.\n\nInterested in crawling specific parts of the Internet with RiskIQ technology? Now you can\ntask our virtual users to work for you at scale. RiskIQ offers URL crawling through our\nSecurity Intelligence Services (SIS), so you can capture the same kind of data we used in\n[this post.

We have some suspected hosts that are potentially\nrelated to this campaign, but we don’t have proof (yet), these are not listed, but we will keep\nan eye out for any confirmed activity.\n\nBelow list does not include IOCs obtained from Proofpoint’s malware analysis, those are\navailable in their report or from the full list of IOCs is available in our RiskIQ Community\nProject: https://community.riskiq.com/projects/03e1e06f-4644-3b0e-7721-682b928d2001?\nguest=true&_ga=2.250911174.117879041.1513562791-1318539965.1474487244\n\n**Domain**\n\nxn--electrm-s2a.org\n\nxn--btcongold-g5ad.com\n\n\n-----\n\nxn--btcongold-54ad.com\n\nxn--bitcoingod-8yb.com\n\nxn--bitcoingld-lcb.org\n\nxn--bitcoigold-o1b.com\n\nxn--bitcingold-hcb.org\n\nxn--bitcin-zxa.org\n\n## Subscribe to Our Newsletter\n\nSubscribe to the RiskIQ newsletter to stay up-to-date on our latest content, headlines,\nresearch, events, and more.\n\nBase Editor\n\n\n-----",
