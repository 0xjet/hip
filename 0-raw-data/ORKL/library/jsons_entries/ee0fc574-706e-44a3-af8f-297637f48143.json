    "plain_text": "# Move fast and commit crimes: Conti’s development teams mirror corporate tech\n\n**intel471.com/blog/conti-leaks-ransomware-development**\n\nThere has been a long-lasting trope about cybercriminals for nearly two decades: young men\nsitting alone in a dark basement, hopped up on energy drinks and EDM basslines, crafting\ncode into the wee hours of the morning in the hopes their malware will net them millions of\ndollars after they hack their way into the world’s leading companies. This idea has creeped\ninto the information security industry’s mindset, mainly that it’s nearly impossible to stop\nthese kinds of criminals, who work in small teams or by themselves, because they don’t have\nto follow the corporate norms that are put in place to protect organizations.\n\nThe recent Conti leaks flip this narrative on its head. Researchers with Intel 471 have found\n[that the ransomware group’s development operations mirror that of most technology-focused](https://intel471.com/glossary/ransomware)\ncompanies: scores of employees separated by divisions, building “products'' with commonlyused tools, and a focus on tech-savvy concepts like “continuous integration” and “continuous\ndelivery.” By mirroring the corporate culture of most technology companies, it changes the\nparadigm for organizations that need to protect themselves. Instead of the idea that a rag-tag\ngroup of tech-minded marauders are outmaneuvering organizations’ security teams, the\nreality is that ransomware gangs are devoting time, effort, manpower and money on a\nbusiness-like level for the sole purpose of extorting legitimate businesses.\n\n## Crime needs lots of code\n\nIntel 471 estimates that at one point Conti included as many as 150 members, with different\ndepartments and teams working on a variety of projects. Conti’s backbone was the\ndevelopment team, with subdivisions responsible for building malware, testing its\nfunctionality, and recruiting and onboarding new employees. Each team has “subteams”\nresponsible for their own tasks and projects, including a team specifically working on the\nBazarBackdoor and TrickBot malware. It also included coders developing malware crypters,\nfront- and back-end environments, TrickBot web-injects and various other modules.\n\nThere were at least eight “senior” developers who were responsible for different ransomware\n[builds, while also floating between teams responsible for other malware, crypting services,](https://intel471.com/glossary#:~:text=the%20target%20network.-,Crypting,-The%20act%20of)\nand support projects. Senior developers also reached out to various affiliates for “customer\nservice,” discussing particular attacks and providing various ransomware builds and\ndecrypters.\n\nTeam leaders placed specific focus on the crypting efforts, which was created to keep\nmalware hidden from antivirus software and cybersecurity experts. As many as 13 developers\nworked on crypting services, from development to testing to source code review.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe development team also supported other semi-legitimate projects the group leadership\npromoted in addition to malware, including the idea of launching a “private social network”\nfor cybercriminals and a blockchain platform similar to the BNB Chain exchange.\n\n## Business as usual\n\nThe Conti group tasked team members to recruit developers on legitimate freelance\nmarketplaces as well as underground cybercrime forums. Human resource representatives\nand respective team managers usually told newcomers they would be going to work on\n“illegal” projects and taught them about operational security measures. Some employees\nwere comfortable with what was presented to them, while others struggled with finding the\nright level of operational security. Here is a sample of two conversations with new employees:\n\nThe average salary of a developer was about US $2,000 a month, and those who performed\nwell and met project deadlines received bonuses. The group offered awards, bonuses and\nopportunities for career growth. However, bosses were vocal with those who underperformed\nand threaten to penalize developers’ earnings if they did not meet benchmarks:\n\n\n-----\n\n## Even criminals have customer service\n\nThe Conti team apparently had members who engaged with clients, discussing inquiries and\neliminating bugs that would appear in the malware:\n\nThe same person who chided poor performance among other developers was also tasked with\nreaching out to clients in a sales engineer capacity. The following conversation shows him\ninstructing a customer on what to check before using new builds in future schemes:\n\n## All in a day’s work\n\nThe conversations uncovered by Intel 471 could arguably be found in any legitimate\norganization that depends on code development to be operationally successful. Given that the\nconversations were happening in an organization devoted to cybercrime serves as evidence\nthat ransomware gangs are not fly-by-night operations. These groups are organized enough\nto know that they need time to remain a lucrative endeavor and multiple levels of technical\ntalent to meet those goals. By understanding how closely ransomware gangs mirror\n\n\n-----\n\nlegitimate technology firms, security teams can formulate their defensive posture and\nestablish to the rest of their organization’s operations what needs to be done in order to keep\ntheir enterprise safe.\n\n\n-----",
