The open directory is\nhosted on sfoodfeedf[.]org at www.sfoodfeedf[.]org/wp-includes/Requests/Cookie/\n\n_Shown above: The open directory at sfoodfeedf[.]org._\n\n[@ps66uk already mentioned a file named purchase order.iso which is an ISO file containing](https://app.any.run/tasks/efc05239-00c1-4d7f-91be-bf1daa0f777a/)\nan executable file for AZORult. However, I found another one in the same directory named\n201907060947039062.iso. Further analysis showed it was also AZORult, like the other ISO\nfile.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Shown above: Getting the other ISO file._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Shown above: Extracting the EXE file from the ISO on a Windows 7 host._\n\nIn previous AZORult infections in my lab, the malware usually deleted itself after an initial\nexfiltration of data. This one repeatedly did callback traffic, and there was a .vbs file made\npersistent on my infected Windows host during the infection. This is apparently a more\n[recent variant of AZORult dubbed AZORult++ as described by Kaspersky Labs and followed-](https://securelist.com/azorult-analysis-history/89922/)\nup by [BleepingComputer. It's called AZORult++ because it's now compiled in C++ after](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-azorult-legacy-lives-on-hello-azorult-/)\nformerly being compiled in Delphi.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Shown above: Traffic from the infection filtered in Wireshark._\n\n_Shown above: TCP conversations from my infected Windows host._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Shown above: An example of the AZORult callback traffic._\n\n_Shown above: This AZORult EXE was compiled with C++, a characteristic of AZORult++._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Shown above: VBS file made persistent on my infected Windows host._\n\n**_Malware indicators_**\n\nSHA256 hash:\ned7c0a248904a026a0e3cabded2aa55607626b8c6cfc8ba76811feed157ecea8\n\nFile size: 1,232,384 bytes\nFile description AZORult EXE\n[Any.Run analysis](https://app.any.run/tasks/ff16f2b1-62a0-4fc2-9c86-5f3c39168314)\n[CAPE sandbox analysis](https://cape.contextis.com/analysis/85125/)\n[Reverse.it analysis](https://www.reverse.it/sample/ed7c0a248904a026a0e3cabded2aa55607626b8c6cfc8ba76811feed157ecea8)\n\n**_Final words_**\n\n\n-----\n\n[Earlier this month on 2019-07-01, I saw an AZORult sample (also compiled in C++) which](https://app.any.run/tasks/3d8c2ef8-7aa9-462d-bf17-930f066fc274/)\ndid the expected two HTTP post requests to exfiltrate data, then deleted itself from my\ninfected host. Today's example proves there can be some variation in AZORult infection\nactivity.\n\n--Brad Duncan\nbrad [at] malware-traffic-analysis.net\n\nKeywords:\n\n[1 comment(s)](https://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/Recent+AZORult+activity/25120/)\n\nJoin us at SANS!
