    "plain_text": "# Nasty Escobar Banking Trojan Is Targeting Google Authenticator Codes For Android\n\n**[hothardware.com/news/escobar-banking-trojan-targets-mfa-codes](https://hothardware.com/news/escobar-banking-trojan-targets-mfa-codes)**\n\nLane Babuder March 14, 2022\n\n[home](https://hothardware.com/) [News](https://hothardware.com/news)\n\nby **[Lane Babuder — Monday, March 14, 2022, 01:58 PM EDT](https://hothardware.com/author/lane-babuder)**\n\n\n-----\n\nDid you ever think you would have a digital drug lord in the palm of your hand? No, we're not\n[talking about a game. We're talking about malware that aims to steal your banking](https://hothardware.com/tags/malware)\ninformation. A new variant of the Abrebot malware has been nicknamed \"Escobar\" after its\npackage name.\n\nWith the package name of com.escobar.pablo, the malware includes a number of the same\nfeatures and code as another one named Aberebot. Researchers at Cyble, a security\nresearch organization, found the malware by scouring a cybercrime-oriented forum. The\nfeature set includes remote view, phishing overlays, screen captures, text-message\ncaptures, and even multi-factor authentication capture.\n\nAll of those features are used in tandem with an attempt to steal a user's banking\ninformation. This malware even goes so far as to disguise itself as McAfee antivirus\nsoftware, and even uses the McAfee logo as its icon. Masquerading as security software is\nnothing new—in fact, we recently reported on malware that was packaged directly inside of a\n[fully functioning 2-factor authentication app.](https://hothardware.com/news/delete-authenticator-android-app-banking-malware)\n\n\n-----\n\n_List Of Permissions That Escobar Malware Can Abuse_\n\nThe full list of dangers of this particular malware is extensive. Not only can it do what was\noutlined above. It can also bypass your screen lock and even send text messages to your\nentire contact list. It also can record audio from the microphone, get your location, and\ninitiate phone calls. The malware even has the capability of checking the phone's access to\ndata, such as if you turned off mobile data and turn it back on again.\n\nThe absolute biggest threat though is that it can even read from the official Google\nAuthenticator app, without user interaction, by directly interfacing with it to capture any codes\nthat might be used during a login process.\n\nHow can you protect yourself from such a nasty piece of work? Well, so far the malware\ndoes not look to have been included in any official distribution via the Play Store. So don't do\nany side-loading of APKs that you don't trust, or don't side-load at all. Watch your mobile and\nWi-Fi data on your device and if there are any apps you don't recognize using extra data,\nlook into them.\n\nIf you have any legitimate malware detecting apps, pay attention to their notices. If you\nbelieve you've been infected, unfortunately, the best way to eradicate is a factory reset. So,\nrun a backup of anything you deem important on your device (be careful not to include the\n\n\n-----\n\n[malware of course) and run your factory reset. The researchers even recommend removing](https://blog.cyble.com/2022/03/10/aberebot-returns-as-escobar/)\nyour SIM card because of the data interaction and capabilities of this app to re-activate your\nmobile data connection without user interaction.\n\nIf you find fraudulent behavior on your banking or financial accounts you should immediately\ncontact the associated institution. You should also change your passwords on anything\nassociated. Additionally, while it is a best practice to not share passwords across accounts,\nwe know full well that people will do this anyway. If any passwords are shared with the\nassociated account it is best to change passwords on all of them.\n\n**Tags:** [Android,](https://hothardware.com/tags/android) [Malware,](https://hothardware.com/tags/malware) [security,](https://hothardware.com/tags/security) [trojan](https://hothardware.com/tags/trojan)\n\n\n-----",
