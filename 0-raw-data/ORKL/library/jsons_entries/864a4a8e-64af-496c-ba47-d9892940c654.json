Telegram, an encrypted messaging\napp, has been used as a secure communications tool by Islamic State.\n\nWhat's more, users of messaging platforms like Signal, Telegram, Pidgin, and Discord\n[should also beware of this malware, according to a recent report by ZDNet.](https://www.zdnet.com/article/meet-blackguard-a-new-infostealer-peddled-on-russian-hacker-forums/)\n\nBlackGuard also targets wallet browser extensions, including Metamask, Ronin wallet, and\nBinance, to name a few.\n\n\n-----\n\nOn top of that, the password-stealing malware would also attempt to steal the data of\ncryptocurrency wallet users, namely, LitecoinCore, AtomicWallet, Electrum, Ethereum,\nExodus, and a lot more.\n\nZDNet said in the same report that the malware would attempt to harvest the wallet address\nand private keys of the users of these crypto platforms.\n\nIt attempts to steal data from users of massive VPN apps, such as OpenVPN, ProtonVPN,\nand NordVPN.\n\nFor email clients, BlackGuard will only attempt to crack the accounts of Outlook users.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that the malware also includes the giant gaming platform,\nSteam, to its list of targeted apps.\n\n**Related Article: New Crypto-Stealing Malware Targets Android, iOS Users | Beware of**\n**These Fake Digital Wallets**\n\n**_This article is owned by Tech Times_**\n\n**_Written by Teejay Boris_**\n\nⓒ 2021 TECHTIMES.com All rights reserved.
