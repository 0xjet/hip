As the number of attacks against ICS overall is increasing, adversaries with specific interest in\noil and gas companies remain active and are evolving their behaviors. Dragos recently discovered a new activity\ngroup targeting this space, HEXANE, bringing the total number of ICS-targeting activity groups Dragos tracks\nto nine, five of which directly target oil and gas. Activity groups are discussed in detail in this report.\n\nA disruption event from a cyberattack at an oil and gas facility can occur at any point across the three major\nstages of oil and gas operations: upstream, midstream, or downstream. From exploration and production to\ncustomer distribution, operational technology (OT) environments are in close proximity to information\ntechnology (IT) networks. As adversaries that target ICS environments improve their capabilities, they can more\neasily execute difficult attacks that cause operational disruptions or environmental damage. Due to the political\nand economic impact, and direct effect on civilian lives and infrastructure, the oil and gas industry has a high\nrisk for ICS targeted destruction and disruption campaigns originating from a cyberattack.\n\nThis report provides a snapshot of the threat landscape as of August 2019 and is expected to change in the\nnear future as adversaries and their behaviors evolve.\n\n## Key Findings\n\n   - The ICS security risk to global oil and gas is high and increasing, led by numerous intrusions into ICS\nnetworks for reconnaissance and research purposes, and adversary use of destructive malware at oil\nand gas facilities.\n\n   - Oil and gas remains at high risk for a destructive loss of life cyberattack due to its political and economic\nimpact and highly volatile processes. Dragos assesses that state-associated actors will increasingly\ntarget oil and gas and related industries to further political, economic, and national security goals.\n\n   - One significant threat includes active supply chain compromises by activity groups targeting original\nequipment manufacturers, third-party vendors, and telecommunications providers.\n\n   - Oil and gas entities should understand the behaviors and capabilities of activity groups targeting\nelectric utilities as these adversaries may shift or expand targeting to include additional energy sectors.\n\n   - Cybersecurity visibility in oil and gas operational environments remains severely lacking allowing\nintrusions to dwell longer and cyber root cause analysis after an incident to remain elusive.\n\n   - The complete “energy infrastructure” (oil and gas, electric, etc) of all countries are at risk and companies\nand utilities are facing global adversaries. Cyberattacks are an increasing means to project power in the\nenergy domain. Traditional oil, natural gas, electric, and others can no longer be viewed as separate\nsectors to protect but rather as a single interconnected infrastructure.\n\n\n# Global Oil and Gas Cyber Threat Perspective\n\nASSESSING THE THREATS, RISKS, AND ACTIVITY GROUPS AFFECTING THE GLOBAL OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY\n\nAugust 2019\n\n\n-----\n\n## Activity Groups Targeting Oil and Gas\n\nDragos tracks five activity groups[1] targeting oil and gas. There are no Activity Group naming convention\nstandards—some are associated with malware while others refer to those deploying the malware or a specific\ncampaign. Dragos does not speculate on the identity of Activity Groups and none should be implied.\n\n**XENOTIME caused the disruption at an oil and gas facility in the Kingdom of Saudi**\nArabia in August 2017 using the destructive TRISIS framework, specially tailored to\ninteract with Triconex safety controllers. The TRISIS attack represented an escalation\nof ICS attacks due to its potential catastrophic capabilities and consequences. In 2018\nXENOTIME activity expanded to include oil and gas companies in Europe, the US,\nAustralia, and the Middle East; electric utilities in North America and the APAC region;\nas well as devices beyond the Triconex controllers. This group also compromised\nseveral ICS vendors and manufacturers, providing a potential supply chain threat.[2]\n\nAssociated Group: Temp.Veles[3]\n\n**MAGNALLIUM has targeted petrochemical and aerospace manufacturers since at**\nleast 2013. The activity group initially targeted an aircraft holding company and energy\nfirms based in Saudi Arabia, but expanded their targeting to include entities in Europe\nand North America. MAGNALLIUM’s capabilities appear to still lack an ICS-specific\ncapability, and the group remains focused on initial IT intrusions.[4]\n\nAssociated Groups: APT 33, Elfin[5]\n\n**CHRYSENE developed from an espionage campaign that first gained attention after**\nthe destructive Shamoon cyberattack in 2012 that impacted Saudi Aramco. The\nactivity group targets petrochemical, oil and gas, and electric generation sectors.\nTargeting has shifted beyond the group’s initial focus on the Gulf Region and the\ngroup remains active and evolving in more than one area.[6]\n\nAssociated Groups: APT 34, GREENBUG, OilRig[7]\n\n1 Dragos categorizes ICS-targeting activity into activity groups based on observable elements that include an adversary’s methods of operation,\ninfrastructure used to execute actions, and the targets they focus on. The goal, as defined by the Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis, is to delineate\nan adversary by their observed actions, capabilities, and demonstrated impact– not implied or assumed intentions. These attributes combine to create\na construct around which defensive plans can be built. At this time, two activity groups possess ICS-specific capabilities and tools to cause disruptive\nevents: XENOTIME and ELECTRUM.\n\n2 https://dragos.com/resource/xenotime/\n3 https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0088/\n4 https://dragos.com/resource/magnallium/\n5 https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0064/\n\n6 https://dragos.com/resource/chrysene/\n7 https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0049/\n\n\n_©2019 Dragos, Inc. All rights reserved. [Protected] Non-confidential content. July 29, 2019_\n\n\n_2_\n\n\n-----\n\n**HEXANE targets oil and gas and telecommunications in Africa, the Middle East, and**\nSouthwest Asia. Dragos identified the group in May 2019. Dragos can only publicly\nshare limited information about this newly-identified activity group at this time.[8]\n\nAssociated Groups: CHRYSENE, OilRig\n\n**DYMALLOY is a highly aggressive and capable activity group that has the ability to**\nachieve long-term and persistent access to IT and operational environments for\nintelligence collection and possible future disruption events. The group’s victims\ninclude electric utilities, oil and gas, and advanced industry entities in Turkey, Europe,\nand North America.[9]\n\nAssociated Groups: Dragonfly 2.0, Berserk Bear[10]\n\n## Threats to Energy Infrastructure\n\nOil and gas entities should realize that a threat to one ICS entity is a threat to all energy infrastructure. No\nlonger are individual threats exclusive to oil and gas, electric, nuclear, or natural gas. As evidenced by\nXENOTIME’s expansion from solely focusing on oil and gas to targeting electric utilities, individual verticals\ncannot ignore threats to other ICS entities if they are not specifically targeted because an adversary’s interests\nand targeting can be highly variable.[11]\n\nDragos observes a trend of threat proliferation among ICS-targeting adversaries. Cyberattacks on critical\ninfrastructure are becoming easier to execute by governments investing in offensive cyber operations, and the\ntools and capabilities required to achieve a disruptive or destructive impact will become ubiquitous. A parallel\ncan be drawn between traditional weapons proliferation including nuclear capabilities, and cyberattacks and\nweaponized malware or toolkits in the cyber realm. Additionally, the spread of commodity IT hardware and\nsoftware into ICS networks increases the attack surface providing ingress opportunities via techniques familiar\nto the adversary.\n\nTherefore, all energy-related entities should be familiar with malicious activity across the energy sectors.\n\n## Activity Groups Targeting Electric\n\nSome of the activity groups Dragos tracks focus on electric utility; these related entities and do not currently\ndemonstrate a specific interest in targeting oil and gas verticals. However, oil and gas and related energy firms\nshould be aware of the below activity groups as their interests and targeting may shift to include not only\n\n8 https://dragos.com/resource/hexane/\n9 https://dragos.com/resource/dymalloy/\n10 https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0074/\n11 https://dragos.com/blog/industry-news/threat-proliferation-in-ics-cybersecurity-xenotime-now-targeting-electric-sector-in-addition-to-oil-and-gas/\n\n\n_©2019 Dragos, Inc.

July 29, 2019_\n\n\n_3_\n\n\n-----\n\nand maritime.\n\n**ELECTRUM currently focuses on electric utilities and mostly targets entities in Ukraine.**\nIt is responsible for the disruptive CRASHOVERRIDE event in 2016.[12] Due to the overlap\nof vendor technologies and relationships in the supply chain with electric utilities, the\npotential for collateral impact in an electric-targeting event is a risk to oil and gas.\nSeveral ICS entities experienced this consequence in the 2017 NotPetya supply chain\ncompromise that impacted companies worldwide. Intelligence firms determined the\nSANDWORM group was responsible for the NotPetya event, and Dragos assesses\nELECTRUM is an offshoot of SANDWORM.[13]\n\nAssociated Group: SANDWORM[14]\n\n**RASPITE targets electric utilities in the US and government entities located in the**\nMiddle East. Dragos also identified additional victims in Saudi Arabia, Japan, and\nWestern Europe, but has not identified new RASPITE activity since mid-2018. Although\nDragos has not observed direct targeting of oil and gas firms, such entities experienced\ncollateral impact from this group’s watering hole activity, thus RASPITE remains a risk\nto oil and gas.[15]\n\nAssociated Group: Leafminer[16]\n\n**ALLANITE targets business and ICS networks in the US and UK electric utility sectors.**\nThe group maintains access to victims to understand the operational environment and\nto stage for potential disruptive events. There is no indication ALLANITE has a\ndisruptive or damaging capability or intent at this time.[17]\n\nAssociated Groups: PALMETTO FUSION,[18] Dragonfly 2.0, Berserk Bear\n\n**COVELLITE compromised networks associated with electric energy, primarily in**\nEurope, East Asia, and North America. The group lacks an ICS-specific capability at this\ntime. While technical activity linked to COVELLITE behaviors exist in the wild, there has\nbeen no evidence or indications this group remains active from an ICS-targeting\nperspective.[19]\n\nAssociated Group: Lazarus Group[20]\n\n12 https://dragos.com/resource/anatomy-of-an-attack-detecting-and-defeating-crashoverride/\n13 https://dragos.com/resource/electrum/\n14 https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0034\n15 https://dragos.com/resource/raspite/\n16 https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0077/\n\n17 https://dragos.com/resource/allanite/\n18 https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA17-293A\n19 https://dragos.com/resource/covellite/\n20 https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0032\n\n\n_©2019 Dragos, Inc.

July 29, 2019_\n\n\n_4_\n\n\n-----\n\n## Oil and Gas Operational Segments Threat Perspective\n\n### Upstream \n\nUpstream ICS and process control network (PCN) operations are where exploration for oil and gas fields, drilling\nwells, and establishing production infrastructure occurs.[21]\n\n**THREAT LANDSCAPE**\n\nNo observed adversary has demonstrated the intent or capability to target upstream exploration and\nproduction operations. The greatest concern for upstream compromise is through telecommunications,\ncellular networks, and satellite connections because it is an adversary’s most effective likely avenue of gaining\naccess to upstream operations, including wellheads and drilling operations.\n\n**ASSESSMENT**\n\nThe oil and gas upstream segment threat environment is relatively small compared to other oil and gas\nsegments. The most likely ICS/PCN target in the upstream segment will be focused on the production portion\nof upstream operations, though the potential for economic espionage is a far greater threat in the exploration\nenterprise network. The technology involved in exploration and production (E&P) would require adversaries to\ndevelop highly specialized capabilities to operate and interact in this ICS/PCN network environment.\n\n### Midstream\n\nMidstream ICS/PCN operations provide the link between upstream production and downstream refining. Major\nmidstream assets include field gathering systems, processing plants, pipelines, maritime transportation, rail\ntransportation, and storage.[22]\n\n**THREAT LANDSCAPE**\n\nIn the current threat landscape, no adversary has demonstrated the intent, motivation, or capabilities to target\nmidstream ICS/PCN environments. The adversary most likely able to develop these capabilities is XENOTIME.\nHowever, adversaries have conducted cyber operations targeting transport and business operations at oil and\ngas entities to an unknown extent – for instance, in April 2018, attackers targeted electronic data interchanges\n(EDI) at multiple US energy companies causing disruptions to business operations.[23]\n\n**ASSESSMENT**\n\nThe oil and gas midstream segment threat environment is an emerging attack surface. Dragos assesses with\nhigh confidence new activity groups will target midstream segments in the future due to its critical role between\nproduction and refining. The most likely ICS/PCN target in the midstream segment is the pipeline transportation\nportion of midstream operations. A secondary focus will also involve maritime and rail, although rail threats\n\n21 https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/upstream.asp\n\n22 https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/midstream.asp\n23 https://www.eenews.net/stories/1060078327\n\n\n_©2019 Dragos, Inc. All rights reserved. [Protected] Non-confidential content. July 29, 2019_\n\n\n_5_\n\n\n-----\n\nthemselves.\n\n### Downstream\n\nDownstream ICS/PCN operations focus largely on refining crude oil and raw natural gas, but also includes\nconsumer distribution.[24]\n\n**THREAT LANDSCAPE**\n\nIn the current threat landscape, several adversaries have demonstrated the intent and capability to target\ndownstream environments, specifically in refining. XENOTIME has demonstrated the capability to access,\noperate, and conduct attacks in the downstream refining operational area. HEXANE, MAGNALLIUM, and\nCHRYSENE activity group operations have facilitated initial access in downstream IT network environments.\nAt this time, these groups are not observed to have an ICS-specific disruptive capability but such activity could\nbe a precursor to an attack on ICS operations.\n\n**ASSESSMENT**\n\nDragos assesses with high confidence that the oil and gas downstream segment threat environment is\ncurrently the largest and most active at this time. The most likely ICS/PCN target in the downstream segment\nwill be refining operations. The nature and role of refining facilities are a high value target for adversaries. This\nis due in part to centralization of operations and resources, technical complexity, presence of extensive ICS,\nand the increased possibility for damage or destruction from highly volatile processes.\n\n## Regional Assessment[25]\n\n### North America\n\nOf the nine activity groups, five target North American entities, including oil and gas focused groups XENOTIME,\nMAGNALLIUM, and DYMALLOY. In recent months, Dragos identified an increase in activity targeting North\nAmerican entities by groups generally focused on oil and gas. Following recent increasing tensions between\nthe US and Iran, Dragos identified MAGNALLIUM activity targeting US government and financial organizations\nas well as oil and gas companies attempting to gain access to computers at target organizations.[26] Dragos\nexpects this activity to continue.\n\nDragos continues to track XENOTIME activity targeting North American oil and gas. XENOTIME activity enabling\npotential supply chain compromise could affect entities in this region. Compromising hardware and software\nICS vendors poses a threat to all ICS entities regardless of region due to global production and distribution of\nICS equipment.\n\n24 https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/downstream.asp\n\n25 Dragos does not perform attribution on threats. However, when other third-parties perform attribution, especially government entities, we document\nthis for others if it is of interest. It is our position that this style of attribution is not valuable from a network defense perspective and thus Dragos does\nnot spend resources on performing this action internally.\n26 https://dragos.com/blog/industry-news/rising-cyber-escalation-between-us-iran-and-russia-ics-threats-and-response/\n\n\n_©2019 Dragos, Inc.

China continues to use cyber\noperations to support its strategic development goals and acquire foreign technology, including sensitive trade\nsecrets and proprietary information.[28] In addition to territorial disputes over oil and natural gas drilling rights\nin the South China Sea,[29] China’s Thirteenth Five-Year Plan[30] and Made in 2025[31] plan both prioritize energy\nand technology initiatives, making the oil and gas sector a prime target for cyber operations.\n\nIt is possible due to upcoming 2020 federal elections in the US, state-backed adversaries who target critical\ninfrastructure such as oil and gas or electric utilities may shift their focus to elections, as observed in previous\nelection years.[32]\n\nIn Canada, oil imports from Saudi Arabia continue to rise despite political tensions between the two countries\nthat peaked in 2018. According to the CBC, Canada’s imports from Saudi Arabia increased by 66% since 2014.[33]\nDragos has tracked an increase in targeting focused on organizations based outside of Saudi Arabia that do\nbusiness in the region. As demonstrated by attacks including SHAMOON3, which targeted Saudi Arabian and\nassociated businesses in 2018, attacks focused on operations or businesses in a specific region can propagate\nacross a company’s global operations, producing potentially significant impacts worldwide.[34]\n\n### Europe\n\nSeven tracked activity groups have targeted entities in Europe, including XENOTIME, MAGNALLIUM,\nCHRYSENE, and DYMALLOY. Dragos recently identified a new MAGNALLIUM password spraying campaign\nattempting to gain initial network access, with targets including European oil and gas entities.[35]\n\nXENOTIME survey and reconnaissance activity is ongoing in this region. Additionally, XENOTIME activity\nenabling potential supply chain compromise could affect entities in this region. Compromised hardware and\nsoftware ICS vendors poses a threat to all ICS entities regardless of the region due to global production and\ndistribution of ICS equipment.\n\nRussia remains the primary antagonist in the European cyber threat landscape. Russian cyber operations align\nclosely with Russian goals and sociopolitical events. Russia views its efforts in cyberspace as an ongoing\nconflict for dominance of the cyber realm.[36] Russian cyber campaigns include the compromise of critical\ninfrastructure for disruption and intelligence collection for future operations.\n\nDragos assesses that Russia will continue its aggressive utilization of cyberspace as a key component in its\nnational strategy to project its power abroad, gather intelligence, and conduct destructive and/or disruptive\noperations against ICS for economic, political, or military gains. US and European intelligence agencies have\nlinked activity associated with DYMALLOY and ALLANITE to Russian state interests.[37] Additionally, third-party\n\n27 https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/13/opec-secretary-general-worried-about-trade-war-effect-on-china-india.html\n28 https://www.dni.gov/files/NCSC/documents/news/20180724-economic-espionage-pub.pdf\n29 https://www.cfr.org/interactive/global-conflict-tracker/conflict/territorial-disputes-south-china-sea\n30 http://en.ndrc.gov.cn/newsrelease/201612/P020161207645765233498.pdf\n31 https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/made-china-2025-threat-global-trade\n32 https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/publications/JAR_16-20296A_GRIZZLY%20STEPPE-2016-1229.pdf\n33 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/saudi-oil-imports-rise-canada-diplomacy-1.5096887\n34 https://www.symantec.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/shamoon-destructive-threat-re-emerges-new-sting-its-tail\n35 https://dragos.com/blog/industry-news/rising-cyber-escalation-between-us-iran-and-russia-ics-threats-and-response/\n36 https://www.cna.org/cna_files/pdf/DOP-2016-U-014231-1Rev.pdf\n37 https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA18-074A\n\n\n_©2019 Dragos, Inc.

These are often a target of malicious cyber activity. It is possible\nICS-targeting attackers temporarily shifted to focus on elections but will likely refocus on other areas of\npolitical or financial interest including the oil and gas vertical.\n\n### Middle East and North Africa (MENA)\n\nAttackers targeting oil and gas are among the most active and disruptive in the MENA region. The TRISIS attack\non an oil and gas facility in Saudi Arabia represented an escalation of attacks due to targeting safety systems\ndesigned to protect human life. Previous disruptive events in the region targeted IT including SHAMOON and\nSHAMOON 2 malware attacks.[39] Additionally, military conflict and fraught political relationships contribute to\nan active cyber threat landscape.\n\nFive activity groups Dragos tracks have targeted this region, specifically focusing on oil and gas and related\nentities: XENOTIME, CHRYSENE, MAGNALLIUM, RASPITE, and HEXANE.\n\nAdversaries associated with the Iranian government conducted data deletion attacks against dozens of Saudi\ngovernmental and private-sector networks in late 2016 and early 2017. Third-party intelligence has associated\nsome activity from RASPITE, CHRYSENE, and MAGNALLIUM to Iranian interests. Additionally, Iran responded\nto US reinstatement of sanctions with low-level, regional attacks against Saudi Arabian oil production and\nrefining infrastructure, indicating a reluctance for direct engagement.[40]\n\nIn recent months, oil and gas companies doing business in the Middle East with operations outside of the\nregion have become targets of oil and gas adversaries. This trend is exemplified by attacks using variations of\nSHAMOON malware. The first wave of SHAMOON attacks in 2012 targeted energy companies affiliated with\nor owned by Saudi Arabia. In 2016, targeting expanded significantly to cover at least 15 Saudi government\nagencies as well as organizations and joint ventures associated with Saudi Aramco.[41] SHAMOON3 in December\n2018 was significantly different in that all publicly-known victims represented foreign oil and gas services or\ncontracting companies, such as Saipem (Italy) and Petrofac (UK).[42]\n\nHEXANE’s activity targeting telecommunications providers in Africa and the greater Middle East is concerning\nand highlights the increasingly common tactic of attacking third-party service providers in an effort to\ncompromise the target victim from activity groups including XENOTIME. By compromising devices, firmware,\nor telecommunications networks used by targets within ICS, malicious activity could potentially enter the victim\nenvironment through a trusted vendor, bypassing much of the entity’s security stack.\n\nNon-governmental organizations affiliated with the oil and gas sector are also a target for ICS-focused\nadversaries. For instance, OPEC has a major influence on global oil prices, international relations, and\n\n38 https://www.cyberscoop.com/trisis-russia-fireeye/\n39 https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-shamoon-2-return-disttrack-wiper/\n40https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-iran-zarif/iran-dismisses-possibility-of-conflict-says-does-not-want-war-idUSKCN1SO09C\n41 https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-saudi-shamoon-targets/shamoon-virus-returns-in-saudi-computer-attacks-after-four-year-hiatusidUSKBN13Q4AX\n42 https://www.upstreamonline.com/live/1658948/petrofac-suffers-it-breach ; https://www.eenews.net/stories/1060109525\n\n\n_©2019 Dragos, Inc.

Dragos assesses\nwith moderate confidence oil and gas targeting will increase in this region.\n\nSignificant oil and gas industry growth is expected across the APAC region. According to reports, Australia’s\nliquified natural gas (LNG) industry is worth $50 billion. LNG exports from the APAC region increased 21% in\nthe 2019 fiscal year and the area is the world’s second-largest exporter of the product.[43] An October 2018\nreport from research firm Wood Mackenzie suggests the APAC oil and gas sector overall is rebounding, led by\nincreased demand, new projects in the region, and more mergers and acquisitions.[44] This growth opens up new\nareas of opportunity for attackers both in terms of attack surface as well as information gathering for business\nand government intelligence purposes. At this time Dragos has not identified activity leveraging a disruptive\nICS capability in the region, but it is likely information gathering targeting ICS entities will continue to occur.\n\n### Latin America\n\nDragos does not track any adversaries targeting Latin America at this time. The Latin American region heavily\nrelies on oil and gas production and exportation to as a significant portion of its GDP, especially in Venezuela,\nBrazil, and Colombia.[45] The reliance on one industry for economic sustainability makes it an interesting target\nfor adversaries interested in destabilizing the region. However, at this time cybercrime is the biggest threat\nfacing this region and it is generally not relevant to ICS. It is possible that political hacktivists will target and\nattempt to disrupt oil and gas organizations as political unrest continues in the region; but, physical and\ntraditional activism means remain a more cost effective means of disruption in these environments and cyber\nshould be considered only a low confidence possibility.\n\n## Top 5 Attack Scenarios for Global Oil and Gas\n\n### 1. Destructive Event Causing Loss of Life\n\nIt is now demonstrable that an adversary can compromise a safety system via cyber means producing a\nloss of safety. In the TRISIS attack, XENOTIME made an error that caused the Schneider Electric Triconex\nSafety Instrumented System (SIS) to fail. The system failed safe as expected, but due to the adversary not\nachieving their goal. If TRISIS succeeded, the attack could have resulted in severe operator injury or likely\n\n43 https://www.australianmining.com.au/news/australias-lng-industry-now-a-50-billion-earner/\n44 https://www.woodmac.com/press-releases/new-wave-of-growth-on-the-horizon-for-asia-pacifics-oil-and-gas-sector/\n45 https://www.opec.org/opec_web/en/about_us/171.htm\n\n\n_©2019 Dragos, Inc. All rights reserved. [Protected] Non-confidential content. July 29, 2019_\n\n\n_9_\n\n\n-----\n\ndestructive purposes.\n\n### 2. Third-Party and Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) Compromises\n\nVendors and third-party contractors provide essential services in performing upstream, midstream, and\ndownstream operations, but with these critical functions comes unintended security risks that adversaries\nare more than willing to exploit to achieve their objectives.\n\nAdversaries are increasingly utilizing third-party and original equipment manufacturer (OEM) compromise\nas a method for compromising intended targets. The adversary utilizes this attack vector to prey upon the\nimplicit trust between companies and suppliers or supporting entities. Organizations in energy, oil and gas,\nmanufacturing, and logistics are especially at risk because of the variety of security zones and trust\nrelationships. The information gained from OEM compromises gives the adversary valuable insight into\ncrafting OEM-specific capabilities.\n\nAnother attack vector exploited by adversaries is managed service provider (MSP) compromise. Similar to\nbut more extensive than vendor or contractor access, MSPs will typically be embedded within and maintain\nextensive remote access to client networks. Thus, a breach at an MSP entity can lead to near-direct access\nto multiple victim networks if undetected. The most extensive operation publicly disclosed was the series\nof intrusions into MSPs conducted by state-sponsored adversaries, linked in other resources to APT10,\nannounced by the US-CERT in 2018.[46]\n\n### 3. IT Malware Bridges OT Gap, Disrupting Operations\n\nAs more OT systems become internet-connected, the traditional OT focus on ensuring high availability with\nless regard for confidentiality and integrity has evolved. The expanded connectivity increases risk and\nmakes the IT environment a potential attack vector into the OT environment. One example is wormable\nransomware attacks that take advantage of Windows vulnerabilities to propagate throughout a network.\nWannaCry ransomware leveraged this method in 2017 which affected various ICS operations, and in a\nrecent security advisory, Microsoft warned a newly-disclosed remote desktop services vulnerability could\nbe used for a similar attack.[47] Commodity malware making the leap into operations can affect a variety of\noperational elements from enterprise business management logistics disruptions to potential plant\nshutdowns.\n\n### 4. Electric-Targeting Operational Disruption Enablement\n\nDue to the oil and gas industry’s reliance on the electric transmission and distribution across upstream,\ndownstream, and midstream operations, an attacker may compromise a source of electric power\ngeneration or distribution used to target an oil and gas entity. An attacker could launch a cyberattack\nagainst the electric entity which could disrupt oil and gas production. The symbiotic relationship between\nthe two verticals means all energy sector companies need to be aware of energy-focused threats and\nactivity groups even if the specific industry is not a current target.\n\n46 https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA18-276B\n47https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/msrc/2019/05/14/prevent-a-worm-by-updating-remote-desktop-services-cve-2019-0708/\n\n\n_©2019 Dragos, Inc. All rights reserved. [Protected] Non-confidential content. July 29, 2019_\n\n\n_10_\n\n\n-----\n\n### y g\n\nAs demonstrated by HEXANE activity, telecommunications networks are valuable targets for ICS-targeting\nattackers. Gaining access to a mobile or satellite network could allow an adversary to interact with\nupstream and midstream operations that utilize cellular devices or satellite connections for\ncommunication, monitoring, and management. Geographically dispersed and remote operations – such as\npipeline compressor stations and offshore oil wells – often depend on cellular or satellite communication\nnetworks. Cellular and satellite network bridges into OT environments need to be closely monitored.\n\n## Defensive Recommendations\n\nAsset owners and operators can implement the following host and network based recommendations to\nimprove detection and defense against ICS-targeting groups.\n\n  - VISIBILITY A comprehensive approach for visibility into ICS/OT environments should be taken to ensure\nthat there is not a visibility gap. Asset owners and security personnel should work together to gather\nnetwork and host-based logs starting from the most critical infrastructure. The ability to identify and\ncorrelate suspicious network, host, and operational events can greatly assist in either identifying\nintrusions as they occur, or facilitate root-cause analysis after a disruptive event. Ensure network\nmonitoring of the ICS through ICS-focused technologies.\n\n  - SEGMENT Where possible, segment and isolate networks to limit adversary lateral movement\ncapabilities. While physically difficult in existing environments, modern networking hardware may\nenable asset owners and operators to virtually segment networks to reduce attack surface and limit\nadversary mobility.\n\n  - ACCESSIBILITY Identify and categorize ingress and egress routes into control system networks. This\nincludes engineer and administrator remote access portals, but also covers items such as business\nintelligence and licensing server links that need to access IT resources or the wider internet. Limit these\ntypes of connections, including firewall rule directionality, to ensure a minimized exposed attack\nsurface.\n\n  - PUBLIC DATA Assess asset owner hosted, publicly posted information and data that, when aggregated,\nwould generate sensitive information that could be utilized by an adversary. Work with vendors,\ncontractors, and other parties – either informally or through formal requirements in contracts – to\nminimize or prevent identification of specific sites, capabilities, or equipment in marketing or related\nmaterial.\n\n  - CONFIGURATION Identify and store “known good” configuration information for ICS devices in nonnetwork accessible locations to provide baselines for comparison as well as restore points in the event\nof disruption. Update these items frequently to ensure such storage mirrors production environments.\nThis action not only assists recovery in the event of IT malware propagating into ICS networks, but also\nfacilitates analysis in TRISIS-like events by providing baselines to compare potentially manipulated\nconfigurations against.\n\n  - DEFENSE-IN-DEPTH Design and implement defense-in-depth surrounding ICS networks where security\ncontrols and enhanced visibility are applied to hosts capable of handling such tasks. Examples include\nrequiring remote access to flow through a jump-host featuring enhanced Windows and network logging\nto ensure adequate monitoring of remote access to the control system network.\n\n\nDEFENSE-IN-DEPTH\n\n\nACCESSIBILITY\n\n\nVISIBILITY\n\n\n_©2019 Dragos, Inc.

July 29, 2019_\n\n\nCONFIGURATION\n\n\nSEGMENT\n\n\n_11_\n\n\n-----\n\nconsequences of cyberattacks.[48] Perform threat assessments to scope the most impactful risk of\ndisruptive or destructive attacks and use such data to shape threat hunting and defensive postures.\n\n  - THIRD-PARTIES Ensure that third-party connections and ICS interactions are monitored and logged,\nfrom a “Trust, but Verify” mindset. Where possible, isolate or create distinct enclaves for such access\nto ensure that third-party access does not result in complete, unfettered, or unmonitored access to the\nentire ICS network. Implement features such as jump-hosts, bastions, and secure remote\nauthentication schema wherever possible.\n\n  - NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE ALLANITE and DYMALLOY regularly target routers and switches during\ncompromises, changing configurations to allow for persistent access or delivery of additional malware.\nImplement router, switch, and firewall configuration review to ensure adversaries do not tamper with\nconfigurations and locate security gaps.\n\n  - THREAT INTELLIGENCE Use and operationalize ICS-specific threat intelligence. Threat intelligence can\nenable identification of known threat behaviors. The Dragos Platform incorporates intelligence-driven\nthreat behavior analytics,[49] automating identification of known attacker behaviors. Dragos WorldView\nThreat Intelligence provides up-to-date intelligence feeds, reports, analysis, and defensive\nrecommendations for new and ongoing threats to oil and gas.\n\n  - RESPONSE PLANS Develop, review, and practice cyber attack response plans and integrate cyber\ninvestigations into root-cause analysis for all events. Especially consider intelligent adversaries which\nmay also attack plans during remediation and response to increase disruption scale and downtime.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe diverse global oil and gas threat landscape represents a significant concern for asset owners and operators\nat upstream, midstream, and downstream operations. Oil and gas remains at risk for a destructive cyberattack\ndue to its political and economic impact and highly volatile processes. Additionally, non-OT environment\nbusiness units that interact with these operations are also at risk for cyberattacks targeting the industry, as\nseen in the various rounds of SHAMOON disruptive activity in the Middle East.\n\nWhile the majority of activity groups currently targeting oil and gas do not demonstrate ICS-specific disruptive\nor destructive capabilities, XENOTIME is a dangerous activity group that has exhibited destructive and\ndamaging behaviors. The enterprise-targeting activity observed by Dragos enables initial intrusion and data\ngathering, and lays the groundwork for an attacker to pivot to potentially disruptive events. Additionally, the\ngrowing threat of supply chain attacks and vendor compromises allows new avenues for activity groups to\ncompromise IT and OT environments alike.\n\nDragos assesses with moderate confidence that the first major cyber-related ICS event causing major process\nand equipment destruction or loss of life will occur in the oil and gas sector. It is imperative that private\ncompanies, quasi-government organizations, regulatory organizations, and governments work together to\nstrengthen the security and safety of these industrial processes and installations to reduce the harm of such\nattacks which will undoubtedly occur sometime in the future.\n\n48 https://dragos.com/resource/dependency-modeling-for-identifying-cybersecurity-crown-jewels-in-an-ics-environment/\n49 https://dragos.com/blog/industry-news/threat-analytics-and-activity-groups/\n\n\nNETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE\n\n\nRESPONSE PLANS\n\n\n_©2019 Dragos, Inc.
