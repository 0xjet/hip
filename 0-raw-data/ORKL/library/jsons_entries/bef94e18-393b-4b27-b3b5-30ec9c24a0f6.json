The six accused](https://www.wired.com/story/notpetya-cyberattack-ukraine-russia-code-crashed-the-world/)\n\n\n-----\n\nhackers work for the Russian Main Intelligence Directorate, commonly known as the GRU,\nthat’s been connected to interference in the 2016 U.S. election and other major cyberattacks.\n\nBesides NotPetya, the alleged co-conspirators were behind destructive malware attacks\n[beginning in December 2015 that disrupted Ukraine’s electricity grid; 2017 spearphishing](https://www.cyberscoop.com/blackout-ukraine-probably-bigger-deal-think/)\ncampaigns linked to hack-and-leak efforts to interfere in the French election; attacks related\nto the Winter Olympics in 2017 and 2018, during a time where Russia was feuding with the\nOlympics over a doping scandal; spearphishing attacks in 2018 against investigations into\nthe nerve agent poisoning of former Russian intelligence officer Sergei Skripal and others;\nand 2018 and 2019 campaigns against numerous targets in Georgia, including an attempt to\ncompromise the network of Parliament.\n\n[Cybersecurity researchers have labeled the hackers “Sandworm Team,” “Telebots,” “Voodoo](https://www.cyberscoop.com/tag/sandworm/)\nBear” and “Iron Viking.” They are long believed to be behind those attacks and many others\namong the most high-profile in history.\n\n[“No country has weaponized its cyber capabilities as maliciously or irresponsibly as Russia,](https://www.cyberscoop.com/tag/russia/)\nwantonly causing unprecedented damage to pursue small tactical advantages and to satisfy\nfits of spite,” said John Demers, the assistant attorney general for national security. “Today\nthe Department has charged these Russian officers with conducting the most disruptive and\ndestructive series of computer attacks ever attributed to a single group, including by\nunleashing the NotPetya malware.”\n\nThe defendants — Yuriy Sergeyevich Andrienko, Sergey Vladimirovich Detistov, Pavel\nValeryevich Frolov, Anatoliy Sergeyevich Kovalev, Artem Valeryevich Ochichenko and Petr\nNikolayevich Pliskin — face charges of conspiracy to conduct computer fraud and abuse,\nconspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, damaging protected computers and aggravated\nidentity theft.\n\n[The Justice Department previously charged Kovalev, in 2018, alongside a group of other](https://www.cyberscoop.com/dnc-hack-indictments-russia-gru-guccifer-2-0/)\nRussian officers for hacking Democrats during the 2016 campaign.\n\nEven though the announcement comes mere weeks before Election Day in the U.S., Demers\ntold reporters that the timing was “not particularly” tied to the vote. The indictment follows a\nsurge in U.S. government responses to accused hacking by Russia, China and Iran, all three\n[of whom are among the top nations the intelligence community has accused of seeking to](https://www.cyberscoop.com/2020-election-china-trump-russia-biden-evanina/)\ninterfere in the 2020 campaign.\n\nIn a background briefing with reporters, a DOJ official said: “Generally, it is a warning. It’s a\nwarning to these countries and the actors working with them these activities are not quite as\ndeniable as they might have hoped they were, originally.”\n\nThe U.S. NotPetya victims cited in the indictment include “hospitals and other medical\nfacilities in the Heritage Valley Health System (‘Heritage Valley’) in the Western District of\nPennsylvania; a A FedEx Corporation subsidiary TNT Express B V ; and a large U S\n\n\n-----\n\npharmaceutical manufacturer. A grand jury in Pittsburgh returned the indictment.\n\nThe December, 2015 attack on the Ukrainian power grid left nearly 230,000 people without\npower, with the hackers using the BlackEnergy, Industroyer and KillDisk malware in attacks\nthat stretched into late 2016.\n\nThe department worked on the indictment with authorities in Ukraine, South Korea, New\nZealand, Georgia, the U.K. and other governments, as well as Google, Cisco, Facebook and\nTwitter.\n\nAlso Monday, the U.K. said [the GRU conducted cyber reconnaissance against officials and](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-exposes-series-of-russian-cyber-attacks-against-olympic-and-paralympic-games)\norganizations involved in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics before they were postponed.\n\n“The GRU’s actions against the Olympic and Paralympic Games are cynical and reckless,”\nsaid Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab. “We condemn them in the strongest possible terms.”\n\nThe indictment is available in full below.\n\n[documentcloud url=”http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/7245159-2020-10-19Unsealed-Indictment-0.html” responsive=true]\n\n\n-----",
