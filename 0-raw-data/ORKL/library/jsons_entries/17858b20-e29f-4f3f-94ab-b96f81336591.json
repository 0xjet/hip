It also steals any local SSH keys it finds, and\nlaunches further SSH brute-force attacks to infect other exposed devices on the internet.\n\nThe researchers at Intezer describe Kaiji as “simple” and “in its early stages.” Their\nexplanation for this is that Kaiji was written from scratch, rather than reusing existing botnet\ncode available on the internet.\n\nThe expectation, however, is that Kaiji may very well be developed further and become more\nsophisticated over time – potentially escalating the number of devices it could hijack and the\nlevel of disruption it could cause.\n\n[Furthermore, the security researchers believe that Kaiji confirms a growing trend for more](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/the-gopher-in-the-room-analysis-of-golang-malware-in-the-wild/)\nonline criminals to migrate to the Go language – sometimes referred to as GoLang – for their\nmalware development rather than more common choices for IoT malware such as C and\nC++.\n\n[Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) for Kaiji have been published on Intezer’s blog.](https://intezer.com/blog/research/kaiji-chinese-iot-malware-turning-to-golang/)\n\nIt should go without saying that users would be wise to restrict SSH access to their servers\nand IoT devices wherever possible, and use unique, complex passwords.\n\n**TAGS**\n\n[smart home](http://10.10.0.46/blog/hotforsecurity/tag/smart-home/)\n\n**AUTHOR**\n\n\n-----\n\n## Graham CLULEY\n\nGraham Cluley is an award-winning security blogger, researcher and public speaker.
