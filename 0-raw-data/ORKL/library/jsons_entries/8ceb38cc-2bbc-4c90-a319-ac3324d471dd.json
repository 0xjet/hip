At the Tianfu Cup hacking contest last year, the white hat hacking](https://thehackernews.com/2021/12/latest-apple-ios-update-patches-remote.html)\nteam demonstrated several security flaws that allowed for remotely jailbreaking a fully patched\niPhone 13 Pro running iOS 15.\n\n## The Shadow Brokers leaks\n\n[Equation Group, designated as the \"crown creator of cyber espionage\" by Russian security firm](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/actor/equation_group)\nKaspersky, is the name assigned to a sophisticated adversary that's been active since at least 2001\nand has used previously undisclosed zero-day exploits to \"infect victims, retrieve data and hide\n[activity in an outstandingly professional way,\" some of which were later incorporated into Stuxnet.](https://thehackernews.com/2013/07/Edward-Snowden-Stuxnet-NSA-Israel.html)\n\nThe attacks have targeted a variety of sectors in no less than 42 countries, counting governments,\ntelecom, aerospace, energy, nuclear research, oil and gas, military, nanotechnology, Islamic\nactivists and scholars, media, transportation, financial institutions, and companies developing\nencryption technologies.\n\n[The group is believed to be linked to the NSA's Tailored Access Operations (TAO) unit, while](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tailored_Access_Operations)\n[intrusion activities pertaining to a second collective known as Longhorn (aka The Lamberts) have](https://securelist.com/apt-trends-report-q1-2021/101967/#other-interesting-discoveries)\nbeen attributed to the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).\n\nEquation Group's malware toolset became public knowledge in 2016 when a group calling itself the\n[Shadow Brokers leaked the entire tranche of exploits used by the elite hacking team, with](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shadow_Brokers)\n[Kaspersky uncovering code-level similarities between the stolen files and that of samples identified](https://securelist.com/the-equation-giveaway/75812/)\nas used by the threat actor.\n\n## Bvp47 as a covert backdoor\n\nThe incident analyzed by Pangu Lab comprises two internally compromised servers, an email and\nan enterprise server named V1 and V2 respectively, and an external domain (identified as A),\nsporting a novel two-way communication mechanism to exfiltrate sensitive data from the systems.\n\n\n-----\n\n\"There is abnormal communication between external host A and the V1 server,\" the researchers\nsaid. \"Specifically, A first sends a [SYN packet with a 264-byte payload to port 80 of the V1 server,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol#Connection_establishment)\nand then the V1 server immediately initiates an external connection to the high-end port of the A\nmachine and maintains a large amount of exchange data.\"\n\nSimultaneously, V1 connects to V2 via the [SMB service to perform a number of operations,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Message_Block)\nincluding logging in to the latter with an administrator account, trying to open terminal services,\nenumerating directories, and executing PowerShell scripts through scheduled tasks.\n\n\n-----\n\nCyberSecurity\n\n\nV2, for its part, also connects to V1 to retrieve a PowerShell script and an encrypted second-stage\npayload, the encrypted execution results of which are sent back to V1, which, according to the\nresearchers, \"acts as a data transfer between the A machine and the V2 server.\"\n\nThe Bvp47 backdoor installed on the servers consists of two parts, a loader which is responsible for\ndecoding and loading the actual payload into memory. \"Bvp47 generally lives in the Linux operating\nsystem in the demilitarized zone that communicates with the Internet,\" the researchers said. \"It\nmainly assumes the core control bridge communication role in the overall attack.\"\n\n## Links to the Equation Group\n\n\n-----\n\nPangu Lab s attribution to Equation Group stems from overlaps with exploits contained in a GPG[encrypted archive file published by the Shadow Brokers – \"eqgrp-auction-file.tar.xz.gpg\" – as part of](https://github.com/x0rz/EQGRP)\na [failed](https://imgur.com/a/sYpyn) [auction of the cyber weapons in August 2016.](https://www.riskbasedsecurity.com/2016/08/15/the-shadow-brokers-lifting-the-shadows-of-the-nsas-equation-group/)\n\n\"In the process of analyzing the 'eqgrp-auction-file.tar.xz.gpg' file, it was found that Bvp47 and the\nattacking tools in the compressed package were technically deterministic, mainly including\n'dewdrops,' 'suctionchar_agents,' 'tipoffs,' 'StoicSurgeon,' 'incision' and other directories,\" the\nresearchers explained.\n\n[\"The 'tipoffs' directory contains the RSA asymmetric algorithm private key used in the Bvp47 covert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem))\nchannel [for] command execution and other operations. On this basis, it can be confirmed that\nBvp47 is from [the] Equation group.\"\n\nThe findings mark the second time hitherto undocumented malware developed by the Equation\nGroup has come to light in as many months. In late December 2021, Check Point Research\n[disclosed details of a diagnostic utility called \"DoubleFeature\" that's used in conjunction with the](https://thehackernews.com/2021/12/experts-detail-logging-tool-of.html)\nDanderSpritz malware framework.\n\n\"Judging from the attack tools related to the organization, including Bvp47, Equation group is\nindeed a first-class hacking group,\" the researchers concluded.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe tool is well-designed, powerful, and widely adapted. Its network attack capability equipped by\nzero-day vulnerabilities was unstoppable, and its data acquisition under covert control was with little\neffort. The Equation Group is in a dominant position in national-level cyberspace confrontation.\"\n\nSHARE _�_ _�_ _�_ _�_ __\nSHARE _�_\n\n\n-----",
