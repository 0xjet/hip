The COVID-19 pandemic also permeated\nthrough the cyber world as threat actors exploited\nthe resulting fear and uncertainty. A greater reliance\non remote working brought in to focus the new and\nexisting threats to related technologies and\ninfrastructure.\n\nMajor shifts in the tactics used by the threat actors\nbehind multiple ransomware families saw mass\ndata exfiltration performed prior to encrypting a\nvictim’s systems. As a result, leak sites came into\nprominence, bringing the compromise directly into\nthe public domain and increasing pressure on\nvictims to meet ransom demands. The success of\nsuch operations brought new players to the market\nand even attracted established cyber criminal\ngroups to add ransomware to their portfolios. As\nthe demand for ransomware services grew, affiliate\nprogrammes and Ransomware-as-a-Service\n(RaaS) schemes lowered the barrier to entry for\ninexperienced threat actors.\n\nLike the rest of the world, threat actors adapted to\nthe changes brought about by the global pandemic.\nBoth cyber criminals and advanced persistent\nthreat actors (APTs) were quick to incorporate the\ntheme in their phishing emails and document lures.\nThe pandemic theme evolved over time to reflect\nshifting concerns from the availability of masks, to\nfinancial aid schemes, and news about vaccines,\nshowing that most threat actors are willing to\nexploit any circumstance to make their operations\n\n\nmore successful. For the most part, threat actors\nused these themes to carry out their normal\nactivity, however, response efforts have also been a\nfocal point with vaccine-related research highly\nsought after by several threat actors.\n\nSeveral themes observed in 2019 continued to play\ntheir part in the threat landscape throughout 2020:\nintelligence gathering activity has continued to\nalign to the geopolitical landscape, mirroring\nreal-world events and the strategic aims of nation\nstates; there has also been a growing trend of\nthreat actors historically aligned to espionage\nactivity being linked to financially motivated activity,\nin operations likely motivated by personal gain; and\nthe supply chain remained a key target with threat\nactors looking to exploit privileged access and\ntrusted relationships. In 2020, both the public and\nprivate sectors continued to be brazen in attributing\ncyber attacks and making greater use of legal\naction to disrupt malicious activity.\n\nThis report analyses the overarching and thematic\ntrends from 2020, including mapping tools,\ntechniques, and procedures to the cyber threat\nlandscape. Our analysis is based on our in-house\nintelligence datasets on cyber attacks and targeting\nfrom a variety of threat actors, intelligence gleaned\nfrom our incident response engagements around\nthe world, and our Managed Cyber Defence\nservice, as well as publicly available information\nfrom the cyber security community. This report\nintends to highlight the most prolific cyber trends\nPwC observed throughout 2020 and explore their\nwider impact.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### A cyber pandemic\n\n###### The COVID-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented global impact, with organisations across all sectors having to adapt and find new ways of working. The shift to remote working brought immediate risks and altered the threat landscape for many organisations. Changes to standard work practices and an increased level of messaging has put employees at a greater risk of exploitation through social engineering. At the technical level, the rapid deployment of new VPN endpoints and introduction of online collaboration tools, has not only served to facilitate remote working, but also increased the potential attack surface.\n\n PwC has seen both cyber criminals and espionage threat actors taking advantage of this massive shift, with widespread targeting of all sectors and regions.\n\n\n-----\n\n|Business as usual As the impact of the virus spread across the Figure 1 – Website spoofing Canada’s COVID-19 E globe, threat actors were quick to capitalise Response Benefit (leopardfitness[.]com) on the atmosphere of fear and uncertainty, enticing individuals to open phishing lures or browse to a malicious website. Whilst the use of timely lures mirroring real world events is a common tactic, as a theme, COVID-19 has been abused by both cyber criminals and espionage threat actors on a wide scale. From our observations, the majority of threat actors started using the pandemic as a persistent lure theme by late February 2020, and volumes of COVID-19 themed lures peaked in March, with a significant decrease in the second half of the year.

We also observed White\nAustaras (a.k.a. TA505) using a COVID-19 themed\nphishing email to target users across North\nAmerica.[4] This included targets in the healthcare,\nmanufacturing and pharmaceutical industries in the\nUS;[5] this reflected a wider trend by threat actors to\nexploit the pandemic as a means to distribute both\nmass and targeted spam campaigns, while public\nsusceptibility to social engineering was likely to be\nat its highest.\n\nEspionage threat actors also made use of\nCOVID-19 themed lures in conducting their\ncampaigns.[6] For example, the Vietnam-based\nthreat actor, Scarlet Ioke (a.k.a. OceanLotus,\nAPT32) was observed using a COVID-19 themed\nlure to target Mandarin speaking victims.[7] Decoy\ndocuments with content taken from the New York\nTimes and the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture were\ndisplayed to the user upon execution, whilst the\nmalicious process ran in the background. This was\nobserved to drop a remote access trojan (RAT)\nknown as DenesRAT as the final payload.\n\n\n###### Targeted response\n\nAs the pandemic took hold, the search for a\nvaccine became a global priority, with\nbreakthroughs in this area seen as a necessary\nstep in getting back to normality. We saw several\nadvanced persistent threat actors (APTs)\nperforming intelligence gathering and collection\nactivities on organisations involved in the research\nand rollout of vaccine targeting. There are several\nfactors which make this data valuable. On a\ncountry level, the ability to produce vaccines and\nassociated treatments domestically would create a\nlevel of supply resilience and minimise the costs\nassociated with purchasing from third parties.\nThere may also be a political advantage to be\ngained from the successful rollout of\nvaccination schemes.\n\n###### WellMess\n\nIn July 2020, the UK’s National Cyber Security\nCentre (NCSC) reported that malware known as\nWellMess was used to perform intelligence\ngathering from several organisations involved with\nCOVID-19 vaccine development.[8] The activity was\nattributed to the Russia-based threat actor, Blue\nKitsune (a.k.a. APT29). WellMess is a highly\nversatile backdoor; we have analysed samples\nwritten in both. NET and Go, with the latter seen in\n32-bit and 64-bit variants as both ELF and PE files,\nallowing for deployment to different architectures.[9]\nIt has several robust network communication\nmethods and a wide range of functionality including\nthe ability to run PowerShell scripts post-infection.\nThrough our analysis, we observed strings used as\nfile paths which likely indicate the exploitation of\nCOVID-19 research facilities by the threat actor.\nThese correspond to a Canadian vaccine\nresearch company and the University that stood up\nthe Research Headquarters for Epidemic\nPrevention and Control with the Chinese Academy\nof Science.[10]\n\n\n[2 ‘Coronavirus Goes Cyber With Emotet’, IBM, https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/collection/18f373debc38779065a26f1958dc260b](https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/collection/18f373debc38779065a26f1958dc260b)\n\n3 ‘Cyber pandemic – two months on’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20200603-02A\n\n4 ‘TA505 exploiting COVID-19’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20200420-01A\n\n5 \u0007‘TA505 and Others Launch New Coronavirus Campaigns; Now the Largest Collection of Attack Types in Years’, Proofpoint,\n\n[https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/ta505-and-others-launch-new-coronavirus-campaigns-now-largest-collection-attack](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/ta505-and-others-launch-new-coronavirus-campaigns-)\n\n[6 ‘APT using COVID content for targeted attacks| CREST Webinar’, YouTube, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYC0AWQ3tXo (24th November 2020)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYC0AWQ3tXo)\n\n7 ‘New name, same me – Scarlet Ioke targets China’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20200505-01A\n\n[8 ‘Advisory: APT29 targets COVID-19 vaccine development’, NCSC, https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/advisory-apt29-targets-covid-19-vaccine-development (16th July 2020)](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/advisory-apt29-targets-covid-19-vaccine-development)\n\n9 \u0007‘How WellMess malware has been used to target COVID-19 vaccines, PwC,\n\n[https://www.pwc.co.uk/issues/cyber-security-services/insights/cleaning-up-after-wellmess.html (16th July 2020)](https://www.pwc.co.uk/issues/cyber-security-services/insights/cleaning-up-after-wellmess.html)\n\n[10 \u0007‘Analysis of WellMail malware’s Command and Control (C2) server’, PwC, https://www.pwc.co.uk/issues/cyber-security-services/insights/wellmail.html](https://www.pwc.co.uk/issues/cyber-security-services/insights/wellmail.html)\n\n\n-----\n\n###### An AppleSeed a day\n\nBetween late August and November 2020, we\nobserved North Korea-based threat actor Black\nBanshee (a.k.a. Kimsuky) registering domains\nimpersonating a number of entities in the\nhealthcare and pharmaceutical sectors and\ninvolved in COVID-19 vaccine and treatment\nresearch in Europe and South Korea, as well as the\nWorld Health Organisation (WHO).[11] Further\ndomains impersonating other entities in the\nbiopharmaceutical space had infrastructure\noverlaps with command and control (C2) servers for\nAppleSeed and FlowerPower, two malware families\nwe attribute uniquely to Black Banshee.[12]\n\nAlthough the WHO has confirmed that North Korea\nwould be among the low-income countries to be\nsupported in the COVAX Advance Market\nCommitment agreement to allow access to\nCOVID-19 treatment drugs and vaccination, and\ndespite North Korean government officials denying\nthat there have been any COVID-19 cases in the\ncountry, North Korea continues to be under\ninternational sanctions and cut off from the\ninternational research community. It is likely that\nBlack Banshee’s uptick in COVID-19 related activity\nwas motivated by intelligence gathering, as vaccine\nand treatment trials were underway.\n\n\n###### A Charming phish\n\nIran-based threat actor Yellow Garuda (a.k.a.\nCharming Kitten) was observed by PwC using\na fake Yahoo login page that almost certainly\nlooked to be targeting the email account of an\nexecutive within a major pharmaceutical\ncompany working on the COVID-19 vaccine.[13]\nThis activity was in alignment to open source\nreports that the same pharmaceutical\ncompany was being targeted by the threat\nactor.[14] The campaign involved the use of a\ndomain attempting to obtain a two-factor\nauthentication (2FA) code for this email\naccount, which the threat actor could\nsubsequently use to bypass the email’s\nsecurity check. Given the profile of the victim\nand our understanding of how Yellow Garuda\nconducts its campaigns, it is likely that the\nindividual was targeted as a means to gaining\naccess to corporate information.\n\n\n###### Probing for vulnerabilities\n\nIn May 2020, the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)\nissued a joint announcement concerning the targeting of COVID-19 research organisations by China-based threat actors.\nIt was reported that threat actors had attempted to obtain data concerning vaccines, treatments and testing from\n‘networks and personnel affiliated with COVID-19-related research’.[15]\n\nThis announcement aligns with accusations made in an indictment against two Chinese nationals, unsealed by the US\nDepartment of Justice (DOJ) in July 2020.[16] The indictment accused the individuals of conducting intelligence gathering\ncyber attacks in alignment to state interests, as well as financially motivated attacks for personal gain. Whilst the list of\nalleged attacks went back to 2009, the individuals were also accused of probing for vulnerabilities in organisations\ninvolved in the development of COVID-19 vaccines, testing technology, and treatments. However, it is noted that their\nfocus on healthcare preceded the COVID-19 pandemic.[17]\n\n\n11 \u0007‘Black Banshee targets COVID-19 research’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20201007-01A\n\n12 ‘One AppleSeed a day keeps COVID-19 away’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-QRT-20201113-02A\n\n13 \u0007‘Yellow Garuda and COVID-19’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-QRT-20200511-01A\n\n[14 \u0007‘Exclusive: Iran-linked hackers recently targeted coronavirus drugmaker Gilad –sources’, Reuters, https://www.reuters.com/article/us-healthcare-coronavi­](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-healthcare-coronavirus-gilead-iran-ex/exclusive-iran-linked-hackers-recently-targeted-coronavirus-drugmaker-gilead-sources-idUSKBN22K2EV)\n\n[rus-gilead-iran-ex/exclusive-iran-linked-hackers-recently-targeted-coronavirus-drugmaker-gilead-sources-idUSKBN22K2EV (8th March 2020)](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-healthcare-coronavirus-gilead-iran-ex/exclusive-iran-linked-hackers-recently-targeted-coronavirus-drugmaker-gilead-sources-idUSKBN22K2EV)\n\n[15 \u0007‘People’s Republic of China (PRC) Targeting of COVID-19 Research Organizations’, CISA, https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Joint_FBI-CI­](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Joint_FBI-CISA_PSA_PRC_Targeting_of_COVID-19_Research_Organizations_S508C.pdf.pdf)\n\n[SA_PSA_PRC_Targeting_of_COVID-19_Research_Organizations_S508C.pdf.pdf (13th May 2020)](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Joint_FBI-CISA_PSA_PRC_Targeting_of_COVID-19_Research_Organizations_S508C.pdf.pdf)\n\n16 \u0007‘Two Chinese Hackers Working with the Ministry of State Security Charged with Global Computer Intrusion Campaign Targeting Intellectual Property and Con­\n\n[fidential Business Information, Including COVID-19 Research’, US Department of Justice, https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-chinese-hackers-working-minis­](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-chinese-hackers-working-ministry-state-security-charged-global-computer-intrusion)\n[try-state-security-charged-global-computer-intrusion (21st July 2020)](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-chinese-hackers-working-ministry-state-security-charged-global-computer-intrusion)\n\n17 ‘Y f l f 0l ’ P C Th I lli CTO SIB 20200811 01A\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Intelligence gathering\n\n###### Throughout 2020, there was continued alignment between the cyber threat landscape and geopolitical events, with cyber activity seemingly conducted in support of nation state strategy. In this section, we look at intelligence gathering and collection activity conducted by threat actors based in different geographic regions.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Asia Pacific\n\n\n###### The view from Pyongyang\n\nLate 2019 saw the collapse of bilateral talks\nbetween the US and North Korea, which had aimed\nto defuse military tension and nuclear proliferation,\nwith the potential for North Korea to obtain some\nreprieve from international sanctions. Under these\nconditions, Kim Jong Un’s New Year Address to the\nWorkers’ Party of Korea set out to reorientate\nstrategic priorities. In particular, the intention not to\nact in order to alleviate international sanctions, but\nto achieve national strategic objectives in spite of\nthem. This includes the continued development of a\nnuclear force and a rearrangement of the country’s\ncurrent economic disposition.\n\nThroughout 2020, North Korea-based threat actors\nmaintained a very high operational tempo. PwC\nobserved these threat actors conducting multiple\ncampaigns on a global scale, in pursuit of\ncomplementary and at times overlapping targets, in\noverall alignment with the national interests of\nNorth Korea.\n\n###### Black Artemis\n\n Show, don’t tell: the ShowState campaign\n\nThroughout 2020, we observed Black Artemis\n(a.k.a. HIDDEN COBRA, Lazarus Group)\naggressively pursuing companies and individuals in\nthe aerospace and defence industry, as well as\norganisations and individuals dealing in\ncryptocurrency, as part of a persistent, coordinated\ncampaign we call ShowState.[18]\n\n\n###### Throughout 2020, North Korea- based threat actors maintained a very high operational tempo.\n\n\nThe campaign featured significant social\nengineering efforts. Individual victims at targeted\norganisations were lured into opening malicious\nattachments, which mainly contained job\ndescriptions for roles at prominent aerospace and\ndefence companies in the UK, the US, as well as\nIndia, among other countries. Public threat\nintelligence reporting that aligns with the ShowState\ncampaign, also suggested that threat actors\ncreated ad-hoc LinkedIn profiles to reach out to\nindividual victims, establish a rapport, and deceive\nthem into opening the job specification files.[19,20,21]\nRecruitment-themed social engineering of victims at\ntargeted organisations is a tactic that Black Artemis\nhas used on several occasions in the past, as we\nnoted in our ‘Cyber Threats 2019: Year in\nRetrospect’ report.[22]\n\nIn the ShowState campaign, the job specification\nlures were weaponised with malicious macros that\nwould drop and execute a next-stage DLL, along\nwith the appropriate arguments to run the backdoor\nwe call ShowState. We have identified variants,\nincluding a 2020 Mach-O variant, of the same\nbackdoor, which is also known as BLINDINGCAN\nand was the subject of a US-CERT Malware\nAnalysis Report in August 2020,[23] going as far\nback as 2017.\n\n\n18 ‘Artemis Banshee and Shoggoth walk into a bar’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20200630-02A\n\n[19 \u0007‘Operation In(ter)ception: Aerospace and military companies in the crosshairs of cyberspies’, ESET, https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/06/17/operation-inter­](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/06/17/operation-interception-aerospace-military-companies-cyberspies/)\n\n[ception-aerospace-military-companies-cyberspies/ (17th June 2020)](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/06/17/operation-interception-aerospace-military-companies-cyberspies/)\n\n20 \u0007‘Operation [North Star A Job Offer That’s Too Good to be True?’, McAfee Labs, https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/operation-](https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/operation-north-star-a-job-offer-thats-too-good-to-be-true/)\n[north-star-a-job-offer-thats-too-good-to-be-true/ (29th July 2020)](https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/operation-north-star-a-job-offer-thats-too-good-to-be-true/)\n\n21 \u0007‘Operation ‘Dream Job’ Widespread North Korean Espionage Campaign’, ClearSky Security, https://www.clearskysec.com/wpcontent/uploads/2020/08/Dream\nJob-Campaign.pdf (13th August 2020)\n\n[22 \u0007‘Cyber Threats 2019: A Year in Retrospect’, PwC Threat Intelligence, https://www.pwc.co.uk/issues/cyber-security-services/insights/cyber-threats-2019-retro­](https://www.pwc.co.uk/issues/cyber-security-services/insights/cyber-threats-2019-retrospect.html)\n\n[spect.html](https://www.pwc.co.uk/issues/cyber-security-services/insights/cyber-threats-2019-retrospect.html)\n\n23 \u0007‘Malware Analysis Report (AR20-232A) – MAR-10295134-1.v1 – North Korean Remote Access Trojan: BLINDINGCAN’, US Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security\n\n\n-----\n\n###### From Black Artemis to Mac Artemis\n\nIn May 2020, US-CERT released an advisory on a\nmalware family known as COPPERHEDGE, that\nPwC has tracked for several years as Manuscrypt.\nIn 2020, Black Artemis developed several new\nvariants of Manuscrypt across multiple platforms,\nincluding PowerShell, ELF, and Mach-O samples in\naddition to the known x86 and x64 Portable\nExecutable variants.[24]\n\nIts efforts to develop or update its custom tools in\norder to target MacOS have been ongoing since at\nleast 2018, as evidenced by public reports, [25] and\nhave included a multi-platform plugin-based\nmalware framework known as MATA[26] or Dacls\nRAT.[27] Its efforts in this area likely reflect a need to\nwiden its targeting capabilities, particularly in\nrelation to cryptocurrency exchanges and platforms\n– its early macOS campaigns specifically trojanised\ntrading applications.[28 ]\n\n###### Black Banshee\n\nBlack Banshee (a.k.a. Kimsuky, THALLIUM) also\nramped up its operational tempo from 2019, both in\nterms of the number of attacks and its victims. In\n2020, we observed Black Banshee continue\ncampaigns using known malware like BabyShark\nand GoldDragon, as well as introducing new\nmalware families such as AppleSeed (a.k.a.\nAutoUpdate) and FlowerPower.\n\n###### Infrastructure for deception\n\nSimilar to Black Artemis, we also observed Black\nBanshee make renewed efforts to socially engineer\nvictims through multiple means. The threat actor\ncontinued to use suitably timely lure documents\nwith themes that would be relevant to targets. For\nexample, we tracked Black Banshee’s use of lures\nthemed around the US presidential election in early\nNovember 2020, and about post-election\npredictions on US foreign policy thereafter.[29]\nAdditionally, Black Banshee continued to build and\noperate a large network of internet infrastructure.[30]\nThe threat actor is known to register domains\n\n\nhighly likely intended to impersonate specific target\norganisations. Some of these were then used to\nlaunch email phishing campaigns, some to host\nfake login portals for credential phishing, and some\nfor malware command and control.[31]\n\n###### Persistent and sweeping\n\nOverall, Black Banshee actively pursued victims on\nan international scale: from long-standing target\ncountries like South Korea, to recent areas of\nintense focus like Japan. We observed Black\nBanshee target entities across multiple sectors,\nincluding:\n\n- Government entities in South Korea and\n\nsupranational bodies, including the United\nNations and the Office of the High\nCommissioner for Human Rights at the UN;\n\n- Defence companies internationally, including in\n\nSouth Korea and Eastern Europe;\n\n- Higher education institutions across South\n\nKorea, Japan, and the United States;\n\n- Journalists and news organisations in South\n\nKorea and the United States; and,\n\n- Cryptocurrency systems and entities involved\n\nwith blockchain products and research.\n\nOverall, the activity that we assess to have been\nconducted by Black Artemis and Black Banshee in\n2020 is a testament to the double nature of the\nthreat actors’ strategic objectives and\nrequirements:\n\n- Espionage motivated intelligence gathering,\n\nlikely for military, defence or economic\npurposes; and,\n\n- Financially motivated activity, that an August\n\n2019 United Nations Security Council (UNSC)\nreport described as ‘a source of funds for a\nprofessional branch of the military’.[32] This type\nof activity is a way to guarantee the North\nKorean regime the ability to operate in spite of\ninternational economic sanctions, rather than\nhaving to act in order to alleviate them.\n\n\n24 \u0007‘Artemis Banshee and Shoggoth walk into a bar’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20200630-02A\n\n[25 \u0007‘Operation AppleJeus: Lazarus hits cryptocurrency exchange with fake installer and macOS malware’, Kaspersky, https://securelist.com/operation-apple­](https://securelist.com/operation-applejeus/87553/)\n\n[jeus/87553/ (23rd August 2018)](https://securelist.com/operation-applejeus/87553/)\n\n[26 \u0007‘Lazarus’ MacOS Dacls RAT Shows Multi-Platform Ability’, TrendMicro, https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/20/e/new-macos-dacls-rat-back­](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/20/e/new-macos-dacls-rat-backdoor-show-lazarus-multi-platform-attack-capability.html)\n\n[door-show-lazarus-multi-platform-attack-capability.html (11th May 2020)](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/20/e/new-macos-dacls-rat-backdoor-show-lazarus-multi-platform-attack-capability.html)\n\n[27 \u0007‘MATA: Multi-platform targeted malware framework’, Kaspersky, https://securelist.com/mata-multi-platform-targeted-malware-framework/97746/ (22nd July 2020)](https://securelist.com/mata-multi-platform-targeted-malware-framework/97746/)\n\n28 \u0007‘Operation AppleJeus: Lazarus hits cryptocurrency exchange with fake installer and macOS malware’, Kaspersky, Operation AppleJeus: Lazarus hits cryptocur­\n\nrency exchange with fake installer and macOS malware (23rd August 2018)\n\n29 \u0007‘Interpreting Black Banshees alluring lures’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20210115-01A\n\n30 \u0007‘Twelve months of Black Banshee’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20200124-01A\n\n31 \u0007‘To catch a Banshee’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20200622-01A\n\n[32 \u0007‘Report of the Panel of Experts established pursuant to resolution 1874 (2009)’, United Nations Security Council, https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/atf/](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/atf/cf/%7B65BFCF9B-6D27-4E9C-8CD3-CF6E4FF96FF9%7D/S_2019_691.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Sharing is compromising:\n China-based threat actors and the digital quartermaster\n\nIn 2020, PwC observed China-based threat actors\nexecuting campaigns that continue to closely align\nwith China’s strategic objectives. Key areas of focus\nwere countries connected to the contentious South\nChina Sea dispute, countries involved with the\ninternational Belt and Road initiative, as well as near\nneighbouring countries, especially ones with whom\nChina has had territorial or administrative disputes.\nThe primary targets included, first and foremost,\ngovernments and public entities on an international\nscale, and telecommunications providers; sectors\nthat correspond to strategic priorities outlined in the\ncurrent Five Year Plan and likely to be part of the\nnext;[33] and religious communities.\n\nThe sharing of custom tooling among China-based\nthreat actors continues to create a springboard for\nintrusions, while posing a further challenge to\nattribution of malicious activity.\n\n###### Exploited to an 8.t\n\nOne immediate example of tool sharing is the\ncontinued use [34,35] of the 8.t document\nweaponisation framework, also known as\nRoyalRoad. The framework, which has evolved over\nthe span of two years to exploit different\nvulnerabilities in Microsoft’s Equation Editor,[36 ]has\nbeen used by multiple China-based threat actors.\n\n\nEach time, the weaponised documents have been\ndeployed with unique characteristics,\ninfrastructure, capability and victimology overlaps\nwhich has enabled attribution of the sets of activity\nto a specific threat actor. Some of the main users of\nthe 8.t framework in 2020 are detailed below:\n\n- Red Hariasa (a.k.a. Chinoxy), the threat actor\n\nthat PwC assesses is the only one to use both\nthe Chinoxy and FunnyDream backdoors, has\nbeen one of the primary users of the 8.t\nframework in 2020. PwC has observed activity\nusing the Chinoxy backdoor targeting countries\nin Central and South East Asia, including\nKyrgyzstan,[37] Malaysia,[38] and Vietnam.[39]\n\n- Red Orthrus (a.k.a. KeyBoy, APT23) also used\n\nthe 8.t framework as part of its continuous\ntargeting of the Mongolian government and\nMongolian public sector entities, to then deploy\nPoisonIvy payloads[40] or the backdoor known as\nKeyBoy CotX RAT.\n\n- An espionage motivated threat actor that PwC\n\ntracks as Red Nue (a.k.a. SpyDealer) used the\n8.t framework in July 2020 to create a Russianlanguage lure document dropping the LootRat\nbackdoor.[41] LootRat has been in use since at\nleast 2017,[42] and has Android and MacOS\nvariants known as SpyDealer and Demsty\nrespectively.[43]\n\nIt is worth noting that PwC has observed a marked\ndrop in usage of 8.t after the first quarter of 2020,\nwhich could possibly be due to the framework\nhaving been featured in public reporting on multiple\noccasions covering several of its versions.[44,45]\n\n\n###### The sharing of custom tooling among China-based threat actors continues to create a springboard for intrusions.\n\n\n33 \u0007‘Predicting public policies’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-SIB-20200618-01A\n\n34 ‘Chinese Equations’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20181019-01A\n\n35 ‘wll wll wll look what we have here’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20200529-01A\n\n36 ‘A Quartermaster for Compromise’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20190923-01A\n\n37 ‘COVID-19 lure targeting Kyrgyzstan’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20200326-01A\n\n38 ‘8.t Builder seen in Malaysia’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-QRT-20200402-01A\n\n39 ‘Vietnam next in line for Chinoxy’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-QRT-20200529-01A\n\n40 ‘Keyboy taking a trip to Mongolia’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20200415-01A\n\n41 ‘Red Dev 7 gets a Nue name’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20201016-01A\n\n[42 \u0007‘SpyDealer: Android Trojan Spying on More Than 40 Apps’, PaloAlto, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-spydealer-android-trojan-spying-40-apps/](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-spydealer-android-trojan-spying-40-apps/)\n\n(6th July 2017)\n\n43 ‘LootRAT deals four of a kind’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20200130-02A\n\n[44 ‘An Overhead View of the Royal Road’, Nao-Sec, https://nao-sec.org/2020/01/an-overhead-view-of-the-royal-road.html (29th January 2020)](https://nao-sec.org/2020/01/an-overhead-view-of-the-royal-road.html)\n\n45 \u0007‘Multiple Chinese Threat Groups Exploiting CVE-2018-0798 Equation Editor Vulnerability Since Late 2018’, Anomali,\n\n\n-----\n\n###### From Winnti to ShadowPad, the new PlugX\n\nBeyond the 8.t framework, China-based threat\nactors have also been sharing sophisticated tools,\nwhich are deployed in targeted intrusions against\nhigh-value targets. For example, in ‘Cyber Threats\n2019: A Year in Retrospect’ report, PwC assessed\nthat multiple China-based threat actors were using\nvariants of the Winnti backdoor, occasionally also\nsharing infrastructure, techniques, and implants but\noperating independently with different objectives.[46]\nWe continued to observe Winnti activity in 2020,\nwith the US Department of Justice (DoJ) also filing\nan indictment in September against two individuals\nassociated with Red Kelpie (a.k.a. APT41, BARIUM),\none of the primary Winnti users.[47]\n\nPwC has also tracked the ShadowPad backdoor\nbeing used by at least five threat actors with\ndifferent victimology and areas of focus between\n2019 and 2020. While we assess that the recently\nindicted Red Kelpie was likely a primary developer\nand user of the tool,[48] we also identified\nShadowPad activity that we attribute to other\nChina-based threat actors. This included a\ncampaign where we observed overlaps between\nthe usage of ShadowPad and a Bisonal variant we\ncall Biscoff,[49] which has also been referred to in\nopen source as xDll.[50]\n\nWe assess that the campaign, which mainly\ntargeted Russia and South Korea, was highly likely\nconducted by Red Beifang (a.k.a. Tonto Team,\nKarma Panda), which we have observed being the\nsecond primary user of ShadowPad after\nRed Kelpie.\n\n\n###### Plugging into espionage: Red Lich’s PlugX campaigns\n\nPlugX is another malware family that has been\nshared across multiple China-based threat actors,\nand has persisted over the last decade. Throughout\n2020, we observed consistent use of PlugX that we\nattribute to espionage motivated China-based\nthreat actor Red Lich (a.k.a. Mustang Panda, Red\nDelta). Red Lich has been known to use PlugX\npayloads since at least November 2018,[51] along\nwith CobaltStrike, and to have a focus on the Asia\nPacific region.\n\nIn 2020, we noted particular interest by the threat\nactor in technology and telecommunications\nstorage in Asia Pacific, as well as in religious\ncommunities. We identified Red Lich victims in\nMyanmar, Singapore, India, and Hong Kong,[52]\nalong with further targeting and potential\ncompromise of organisations based in Vietnam[53]\nand the Vatican.[54] It is worth noting Red Lich’s\ntargeting of the Christian community,[55,56]\nspecifically in Hong Kong, and of a Vatican-based\nNGO, between May and July 2020, is in line with\nRed Lich’s previous victimology – including\nreligious communities and minorities, both Catholic\norganisations[57] and Tibetan.[58] However, the uptick\nin observed activity for this specific Red Lich\ncampaign between May and July 2020 coincided\nwith a period of tense relationships between the\nVatican and Chinese authorities, over a provisional\nagreement on the appointment of Catholic Bishops\nin China.\n\n\n[46 ‘Cyber Threats 2019: A Year in Retrospect’, PwC Threat Intelligence, https://www.pwc.co.uk/issues/cyber-security-services/insights/cyber-threats-2019-retrospect.html](https://www.pwc.co.uk/issues/cyber-security-services/insights/cyber-threats-2019-retrospect.html)\n\n47 ‘A counterstrike on the money’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-SIB-20200930-01A\n\n48 ‘Shining a light on ShadowPad’s usage throughout 2019’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20200213-01A\n\n49 ‘Red Beifang’s Biscoff trail’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20200810-01A\n\n[50 \u0007‘ShadowPad: New activity from the Winnti Group’, Positive Technologies, https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/analytics/pt-esc-threat-intelligence/shadow­](https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/analytics/pt-esc-threat-intelligence/shadowpad-new-activity-from-the-winnti-group/)\n\n[pad-new-activity-from-the-winnti-group/ (29th September 2020)](https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/analytics/pt-esc-threat-intelligence/shadowpad-new-activity-from-the-winnti-group/)\n\n51 \u0007China-Based APT Mustang Panda Targets Minority Groups, Public and Private Sector Organizations’, Anomali,\n\n[https://www.anomali.com/blog/china-based-apt-mustang-panda-targets-minority-groups-public-and-private-sector-organizations (7th October 2019)](https://www.anomali.com/blog/china-based-apt-mustang-panda-targets-minority-groups-public-and-private-sector-organizations)\n\n52 ‘Storing PlugX’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20200630-01A\n\n53 ‘Red Lich PlugX targeting Vietnam’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-QRT-20200811-01A\n\n54 ‘Red Lich’s PlugX server misconfiguration’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-QRT-20201014-01A\n\n55 ‘Red Lich’s PlugX vendetta’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20200723-01A\n\n56 ‘Red Lich continued Catholic targeting’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-QRT-20200911-01A\n\n57 \u0007China-Based APT Mustang Panda Targets Minority Groups, Public and Private Sector Organizations’, Anomali,\n\n[https://www.anomali.com/blog/china-based-apt-mustang-panda-targets-minority-groups-public-and-private-sector-organizations (7th October 2019)](https://www.anomali.com/blog/china-based-apt-mustang-panda-targets-minority-groups-public-and-private-sector-organizations)\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Case study\n\n**Red Phoenix compromises a technology company in Western Europe**\n\n\nPwC’s Incident Response team responded to a\nRed Phoenix intrusion into a technology company\nin Western Europe in 2020.[59] The threat actor had\naccess to the network from at least May 2019 and\nmaintained access until early March 2020. It initially\ncompromised the victim by exploiting an exposed\nout of date Confluence server, using CVE-20193396. It subsequently deployed the FOCUSFJORD\n(a.k.a. SoldierTrojan, SoldierLoader) malware family,\nwhich we exclusively attribute to Red Phoenix. The\nthreat actor used custom tools as well as living off\nthe land techniques (‘LOLbins’) to move laterally\naround the network. It pivoted to several other\nmachines, and deployed HyperBro, another\nmalware family exclusively attributed to\nRed Phoenix.\n\n###### The other side of the coin\n\n\nIn February 2020, the threat actor attempted to\nmaintain access to the victim network by installing\nupdated versions of HyperBro that sideload from a\ndifferent executable. The new malware beaconed\nout to the same C2 IPs and the payload had the\nsame capabilities, allowing the new and previously\nunseen binaries to be detected by heuristic rules.\nFollowing eviction, the threat actor aggressively\ntried to reacquire access to the network, attempting\nto access perimeter systems from IPs it had not\nused previously in the intrusion, but which had\nalready been provided to the client to block by\nPwC’s Threat Intelligence team.\n\n\nIn addition to China and North Korea-based threat actor activity, PwC noted a significant uptick in activities from threat\nactors based in other countries within the region during 2020. This is mostly likely due to ongoing conflicts in the region,\nwhich have only increased in intensity over the last year. Kinetic conflict has been seen between India and Pakistan, as\nwell as India and China, whilst the South China Sea continues to be a hotbed of political tension. Tit-for-tat hostilities\nhave played out in the cyber realm, with threat actors based in Pakistan, India, and Vietnam alike ramping up their volume\nof operations, whilst simultaneously expanding their tools, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).\n\n59 ‘Hand to hand with a Phoenix’ PwC Threat Intelligence CTO TIB 20200407 01A\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Pakistan\n\nThe Pakistan-based threat actor Green Havildar\n(a.k.a. TransparentTribe, Mythic Leopard) continued\nits use of its backdoor CrimsonRAT in a vast\nnumber of campaigns, including, but not limited to:\n\n- Targeting India Defence targets, using lure\n\ndocuments looking to mimic commendations to\nsoldiers on the 72nd Army Day – this campaign\nsaw the threat actor host its payloads on a\nwebsite feigning legitimacy as a shared drive.[60]\n\n- Targeting Iranian political targets over several\n\ncampaigns, making use of both religious and\npolitical themes in lure documents[61 ]– the\nmotivations behind this campaign are thought\nto stem from both Pakistan-Iran border\ntensions,[62] as well as concern for PakistanAfghanistan border security after the election of\nthe new Quds force leader following the death\nof General Qasem Soleimani.[63]\n\n2020 also saw the threat actor develop a new tool,\nwhich in open source is known as ObliqueRAT.[64]\nPwC has observed several campaigns in 2020\nemploying ObliqueRAT alongside password\nprotected lure documents that are highly likely\nprovided to the victim during correspondence.[65]\nThis shift towards a focus on active social\nengineering is a new technique for the threat actor.\n\nGreen Havildar’s crime wing (a.k.a. Gorgon Group,\nAggah), has also conducted a large number of\ncampaigns, switching its initial delivery mechanism\nfrom Word and Excel documents to Powerpoint.[66]\nPwC has observed these campaigns being\nconducted on a near weekly basis,[67] and it is likely\n– based on their sheer volume in 2020 – we will\ncontinue to see these financially motivated attacks\ncontinue in 2021.\n\n\n###### India\n\nThe targeting displayed by India-based threat\nactors has mirrored political events, with a\nsubstantial increase in targeting of China-based\ntargets, as well as consistent espionage operations\nagainst Pakistan government and defence sectors.\nThe campaigns conducted over the course of 2020\ndisplayed both new and previously observed TTPs,\nwhilst the lure documents often used news articles\nor documents published just days before the attack\nitself. This provides an insight into the reactive\nnature of these threat actors.\n\n###### Orange Chandi\n\nThe India-based threat actor Orange Chandi (a.k.a.\nSidewinder) was particularly prolific in 2020,\nconducting espionage operations targeting the\ndefence sector. Victims have been based mostly in\nPakistan and China, but PwC has also observed\ntargets in Afghanistan. The payloads all used a\nfamiliar attack process from the threat actor of\nmultiple HTA scripts to eventually deploy the final\npayload.[68,69,70,71]\n\n###### Orange Kala\n\nOrange Kala (a.k.a. Donot) also had an extremely\nactive year. The threat actor employed several\ntechniques across 2020, some of which PwC has\nobserved previously, whilst others see the threat actor\nretooling in real time. For example, PwC was able to\nobtain several lure documents and payloads that\nwere not yet complete or ready for operational use.[72 ]\n\nThese files were subsequently used in attacks a\nfew weeks after our initial discovery, likely targeting\nvictims in Pakistan’s Defence sector. The threat\nactor was also seen using open source espionage\ntools for its payloads, such as the remote access\ntrojan WarZoneRAT,[73] sold as a Malware as a\nService (MaaS).[74]\n\n\n60 ‘Green Havildar up to its old tricks’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20200131-01A\n\n61 ‘Green Havildars new focus – Iran’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20200914-01A\n\n[62 \u0007‘Pakistan asks Iran to act on militants behind Baluchistan killings’, Reuters, https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pakistan-iran/pakistan-asks-iran-to-act-on-mili­](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pakistan-iran/pakistan-asks-iran-to-act-on-militants-behind-baluchistan-killings-idUSKCN1RW0EQ)\n\n[tants-behind-baluchistan-killings-idUSKCN1RW0EQ (April 20th 2019)](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pakistan-iran/pakistan-asks-iran-to-act-on-militants-behind-baluchistan-killings-idUSKCN1RW0EQ)\n\n[63 \u0007‘Iran’s New Quds Force Leader Has A Long, Shadowy History With Afghanistan’, RadioFreeLiberty, https://www.rferl.org/a/iran-s-new-quds-force-leader-has-a-](https://www.rferl.org/a/iran-s-new-quds-force-leader-has-a-long-history-with-afghanistan/30379354.html)\n\n[long-history-with-afghanistan/30379354.html (15th January 2020)](https://www.rferl.org/a/iran-s-new-quds-force-leader-has-a-long-history-with-afghanistan/30379354.html)\n\n[64 \u0007‘ObliqueRAT: New RAT hits victims’ endpoints via malicious documents’, Cisco-Talos, https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2020/02/obliquerat-hits-victims-via-mal­](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2020/02/obliquerat-hits-victims-via-maldocs.html)\n\n[docs.html (20th February 2020)](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2020/02/obliquerat-hits-victims-via-maldocs.html)\n\n65 ‘Great minds think alike on the Indian subcontinent’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20201211-01A\n\n[66 \u0007‘Aggah Campaign’s Latest Tactics: Victimology, PowerPoint Dropper and Cryptocurrency Stealer’, HP, https://threatresearch.ext.hp.com/aggah-campaigns-lat­](https://threatresearch.ext.hp.com/aggah-campaigns-latest-tactics-victimology-powerpoint-dropper-and-cryptocurrency-stealer/)\n\n[est-tactics-victimology-powerpoint-dropper-and-cryptocurrency-stealer/ (1st July 2020)](https://threatresearch.ext.hp.com/aggah-campaigns-latest-tactics-victimology-powerpoint-dropper-and-cryptocurrency-stealer/)\n\n67 ‘Threats under the Spotlight December 2020’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TUS-20210111-01A\n\n68 ‘Pakistan targeted by lnk files’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20200423-01A\n\n69 ‘Orange Chandi goes back to school’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20200527-01A\n\n70 ‘Orange Chandi pitches to the board’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20200619-01A\n\n71 ‘Orange Chandis IT Services’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-QRT-20200825-01A\n\n72 ‘’White Dev 23s work in progress’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20200728-01A\n\n73 ‘Let me get this strait’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20201104-01A\n\n74 ‘W B hi d h li ’ Ch kP i h // h h k i [/2020/](https://research.checkpoint.com/2020/warzone-behind-the-enemy-lines/) b hi d h li / (3 d F b 2020)\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Orange Athos\n\nOrange Athos (a.k.a. Patchwork) was observed in\n2020 displaying several techniques PwC had not\npreviously observed or associated with the Indiabased threat actor. One consistent campaign in\nJuly and August 2020 saw the threat actor use a\nvulnerability involving Encapsulated PostScript\n(EPS) images (CVE-2017-0261),[75] with lure\ndocuments targeting:\n\n- Chinese speaking individuals concerned with\n\nSino-Indian border tensions;\n\n- Individuals interested in Saudi-Pakistan\n\nrelations (specifically organisations in oil & gas);\nand,\n\n- Individuals interested in Pakistan-China\n\nrelations (specifically in the technology sector)\n\nAnother significant operation undertaken by\nOrange Athos saw the threat actor taking\nadvantage of GitHub repositories in order to pull\nfurther payloads onto the victim’s machine.[76] What\nmade this campaign particularly unique was the\neffort made by the threat actor to create\nsophisticated lure documents written in Mandarin\nChinese; India-based threat actors will for the most\npart use news articles, but in this instance the\nthreat actor appeared to hand-craft the lure\ndocuments.\n\n###### Vietnam\n\nOf the many threat actors that pervade the Asia\nPacific cyberspace, there were few as active and\ndiverse in their activities as Vietnam-based Scarlet\nIoke (a.k.a.

It ran\na substantial number of operations, favouring not\njust open source tools, such as CobaltStrike, but\nalso building up bespoke capabilities of its own,\nsuch as the remote access trojan DenesRAT.[77,78]\n\n\nThe threat actor also continued to adapt its toolset\nto focus on victims that run MacOS in 2020.[79]\n\nSignificantly, Scarlet Ioke was publicly attributed by\nFacebook to an IT company-based in Vietnam\ncalled CyberOne Group; or CyberOne Security.[80]\nAccording to the attribution, the company operates\non behalf of the Vietnam government, although it is\nunclear whether CyberOne Group makes up the\nentirety of all operations attributed to Scarlet Ioke,\nor a sub-section of them.\n\nThe operations of Scarlet Ioke in 2020 broadly\nconsist of the following:\n\n- Espionage campaigns focused on intelligence\n\ngathering from other nation states in South East\nAsia.

This activity includes the\ncontinuation of common targeting themes, such as\nthe Russia-based threat actors Blue Python (a.k.a.\nTurla) and Blue Athena (a.k.a. APT28) targeting\nMinistries of Foreign Affairs in Central and Eastern\nEurope, and also responses to emerging global\nevents, such as Russia-based threat actor Blue\nKitsune targeting COVID-19 vaccine research.[87]\n\nAt a strategic level, 2020 brought some interesting\ngeopolitical shifts to the region, in particular\nthrough the conflict over the disputed region of\nNagorno-Karabakh, a region which, de jure, is a\npart of Azerbaijan, but which has been under the\n**de facto control of the unrecognised, Armenia-**\nbacked Republic of Artsakh since 1994. In\nSeptember 2020, major armed conflict broke out in\nthe region, and lasted several weeks. We tracked\nseveral threat actors targeting parties to the conflict\nor using themes related to it. These include White\nDev 51, a threat actor we assess to likely be based\nin or affiliated with Armenia, and spear phishing\nactivity from the Russia/Ukraine-based threat actor\nBlue Odin (a.k.a. Cloud Atlas).\n\n###### Nagorno-Karabakh: a frozen\n conflict ignites[88]\n\nNagorno-Karabakh is a territory which has been\ndisputed between Armenia and Azerbaijan since\nbefore the fall of the Soviet Union. The region, while\npopulated mostly by ethnic Armenians, is\ninternationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan,\nand has been formally under Azerbaijani control\nsince the fall of the Soviet Union. However, since\nthe first Nagorno-Karabakh war, which ended in\n1994 with a Russia-brokered ceasefire, the region\nhas been under the control of the Armenia-backed\nRepublic of Artsakh, and remains unrecognised by\nthe international community.\n\nIn September 2020, Azerbaijani forces reportedly\nlaunched offensives intended to recapture occupied\nbuffer areas surrounded by Azerbaijan, as well as\npush into the region itself. The conflict was largely\ndictated by Azerbaijan, which made substantial gains,\neventually capturing the strategic city of Shusha.\n\n\nThis resulted in thousands of casualties, both military\nand civilian, and tens of thousands of civilians have\nbeen displaced. This conflict ended in a Russiabrokered ceasefire in November 2020, which saw\nAzerbaijan regain the buffer areas surrounding\nNagorno-Karabakh and keep its gains within the\nregion itself.\n\nWe have tracked a range of threat actor activity\nconnected to this conflict, by threat actors across a\nbroad range of levels of sophistication:\n\n\nHacktivist groups such as ‘Anti-Armenia Team’ and ‘Monte\n###### 1\nMelkonian Cyber Army’ have engaged in tit-for-tat leaking\nof information, including internal government emails and\ndata related to a nuclear power plant in Armenia.\n\nA threat actor of unknown origin, tracked by PwC as White\n###### 2\nDev 51, used a Python-based backdoor known as PoetRAT,\nto target Azerbaijani government organisations. PoetRAT was\ndelivered by spear phishing documents, most often\npertaining to Azerbaijani government organisations. It\nprovides the threat actor with a range of common RAT\nfunctionality, such as file manipulation and exfiltration.\n\nRussia-based threat actor Blue Odin used a spear phishing\n###### 3\ndocument named PKK militants in Nagorno-Karabakh.doc\ncontaining contents cloned from an article which alleged\nthat several hundred PKK militants were supporting\nArtsakh forces in Nagorno-Karabakh. We assess that this\ndocument was likely used to target Azerbaijani government\norganisations.\n\n\nWe expect that interest in the region will continue,\nparticularly from a number of regional players, such\nas Russia, Turkey and Iran, all of which have vested\nstrategic interests in the power balance in the\nregion[89] – Russia for its direct involvement in\npeacekeeping, Turkey as Azerbaijan’s closest ally\nand partner, and Iran for the fact it shares a border\nwith Armenia and Azerbaijan, control of which has\nshifted dramatically as a result of the recent\nceasefire. We assess that it is highly probable that\nthis strategic interest will be accompanied by\nactivity from threat actors based in these regions.\n\n\n[87 \u0007‘Advisory: APT29 targets COVID-19 vaccine development’ – NCSC, https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/files/Advisory-APT29-targets-COVID-19-vaccine-development.pdf](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/files/Advisory-APT29-targets-COVID-19-vaccine-development.pdf\r)\n\n88 \u0007The use of language and terminology in this section is not intended to demonstrate any partiality. PwC recognises that choice of place name references, for\n\nexample, can be sensitive and the choices made here are for ease of reference rather than partisanship.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### The Snake Persists\n\nBlue Python (a.k.a Turla, Snake) is a highly\nsophisticated Russia-based threat actor, known for\nusing a variety of complex tooling and novel\nCommand & Control (C2) channels, including cloud\nstorage,[90] email attachments,[91] and SMB named\npipes. We observed continued Blue Python activity\nthroughout 2020, which generally aligns closely\nwith the threat actor’s historical targeting priorities\n– government agencies in Central and Eastern\nEurope (with a particular focus on Ministries of\nForeign Affairs and Ministries of Interior).\n\nBlue Python continued to use a diverse and\nsophisticated toolset in order to accomplish its\nobjective, consisting of multiple dropper,\ndownloader, and backdoor malware families with a\nrange of levels of sophistication. Based on our\nvisibility into Blue Python activity, we assess that it\nis likely that simpler and less powerful malware is\ndeployed initially, in order to assess the infected\nmachines and determine whether the victim is of\ninterest to the threat actor; it is only later that more\nsophisticated malware families are delivered.\n\nIn 2020, the changes in Blue Python’s toolset were\nmore evolutionary than revolutionary; that is, it has\nprimarily iterated on known malware families, rather\nthan introducing any entirely new variants. For\nexample, in May, we reported on the use of a new,\ncustom packer with the Kazuar backdoor, a\nmalware family which has been known since at\nleast 2017.[92 ]We also analysed the use of\nPowerShell-based loader scripts as a means of\nloading several Blue Python malware families, such\nas COMRAT v4 and variants of RPCBackdoor, and\nthe role of PowerShell scripts in a compromise of a\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs in Eastern Europe.\n\n\nIn 2020, we analysed a newly discovered malware\nfamily we reported on as BigBoss (a.k.a.\nHyperStack).[93,94] BigBoss implements a simple\ncommunications protocol over SMB named pipes.\nCertain components of BigBoss closely resemble\nother Blue Python malware families – for example,\nthe encryption scheme used in BigBoss is identical\nto that of Carbon, a well-known Blue Python\nmalware family. In essence, BigBoss implements\nfamiliar techniques and methods, but delivered in a\nfar smaller package than many more sophisticated\nmalware families.\n\nWe expect that Blue Python will continue to\nprimarily target government organisations in its\npursuit of information of strategic interest in 2021,\nand that it will continue to both iterate on wellknown TTPs and develop new malware families.\n\n\n[90 \u0007‘Turla Crutch: Keeping the back door open’, ESET, https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/12/02/turla-crutch-keeping-back-door-open/](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/12/02/turla-crutch-keeping-back-door-open/)\n\n[91 \u0007‘From Agent.BTZ to ComRAT v4’, ESET, https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ESET_Turla_ComRAT.pdf](https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ESET_Turla_ComRAT.pdf)\n\n[92 \u0007‘Kazuar: Multiplatform Espionage Backdoor with API Access’, Palo Alto, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-kazuar-multiplatform-espionage-back­](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-kazuar-multiplatform-espionage-backdoor-api-access/)\n\n[door-api-access/ (3rd May 2017)](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-kazuar-multiplatform-espionage-backdoor-api-access/)\n\n93 \u0007‘BigBoss Calling’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20200929-01A\n\n[94 \u0007‘Turla uses HyperStack, Carbon, and Kazuar to compromise government entity’, Accenture, https://www.accenture.com/us-en/blogs/cyber-defense/turla-belu­](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/blogs/cyber-defense/turla-belugasturgeon-compromises-government-entity)\n\nt i t tit\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 3 – Blue Otso domain registrations by month in 2020**\n\n###### 0 4 15 14 16 91 34 139 91 9 10\n\n\n###### Spotlight on Blue Otso\n\nBlue Otso (a.k.a Gamaredon) is a Russia-based\nthreat actor which has historically targeted\nUkrainian government and defence organisations,\nsuch as the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU). Blue\nOtso lure documents often include references to\nthe self-proclaimed separatist regions known as\nthe ‘Luhansk People’s Republic’ and ‘Donetsk\nPeople’s Republic’, and previous documents which\nlikely targeted Ukraine’s military contained content\nrelating to orders for military operations in\nthese regions.\n\nIn 2020, Blue Otso’s targeting of Ukraine both\ncontinued and evolved; while we still saw targeting\nof typical Ukrainian organisations, such as\nattempts to deliver spear-phishing documents to\nthe National Defence Council of Ukraine, Blue Otso\nalso began to cast a wider net, including efforts to\ntarget government entities in Central and Eastern\nEurope in early 2020.[95]\n\nIn December 2020, we analysed some recent\nactivity of the threat actor, based on dates and\ntimes derived from Blue Otso’s domain\nregistrations and malicious documents.[96] These\ndates and times were consistent with the threat\nactor operating in Kiev or Moscow time (UTC+2\nand UTC+3 respectively), with a likely working week\nbetween Monday and Saturday, and almost no\nactivity observed on Sundays.\n\n\nThe above graph shows domain registrations by a\npair of email addresses associated with Blue Otso\nin 2020. Notably, there was a significant uptick in\ndomain registrations in August 2020, potentially\naligning with Ukraine’s Independence Day on 24th\nAugust. Open source reporting[97] has previously\nsuggested that Blue Otso activity often aligns with\npolitical events in Ukraine, including public\nstatements made by the SBU. We assess it is\nhighly likely that this spike in August 2020 was\nintended to disrupt or attack Ukrainian\ngovernmental organisations during Ukraine’s\nIndependence Day. This assessment is further\nsupported by a public announcement from the\nNational Security and Defence Council of Ukraine,[98]\nwhich noted signs of preparation for an attack on\nauthorities and critical infrastructure ahead of\nIndependence Day.\n\nBlue Otso was also among the threat actors we\ndetected having a shift in activity as a result of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. More specifically, after 31st\nMarch, we observed a decrease in Blue Otso\nactivity compared to the previous months from\nJanuary to March. According to open source\ninformation, FSB officers were required to take\nannual leave around 31st March.[99] Ukrainian SBU\nhas publicly attributed Blue Otso to the FSB,[100]\nwhich may explain the drop in activity. However, the\nevidence above clearly indicates a relatively rapid\nreturn to activity, beginning in June and peaking\nin August.\n\n\n95 \u0007‘Otso beyond Ukraine’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-QRT-20200309-01A\n\n96 \u0007‘Blue Otso’s tangled web’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20201208-01A\n\n\n[97 \u0007‘Operation Armageddon’, Looking Glass Cyber, https://www.lookingglasscyber.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Operation_Armageddon_Final.pdf](https://www.lookingglasscyber.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Operation_Armageddon_Final.pdf)\n\n98 \u0007‘The NCCC at the NSDC of Ukraine has detected signs of preparation for a large-scale coordinated attack on state authorities of Ukraine and critical infrastruc­\n\n\n[ture on the eve of the Independence Day‘, National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, https://www.rnbo.gov.ua/en/Diialnist/4669.html](https://www.rnbo.gov.ua/en/Diialnist/4669.html)\n\n\n[98 \u0007‘FSB officers to be sent on unscheduled leave due to coronavirus’, RBC Group, https://www.rbc.ru/society/31/03/2020/5e830d439a794737b2cb7466?from=­](https://www.rbc.ru/society/31/03/2020/5e830d439a794737b2cb7466?from=from_main)\n\n[from_main](https://www.rbc.ru/society/31/03/2020/5e830d439a794737b2cb7466?from=from_main)\n\n\n[100 \u0007‘Operation Armageddon: Cyber Espionage as a Strategic Component of Russian Modern Warfare’, LookingGlass, https://www.lookingglasscyber.com/wp-con­](https://www.lookingglasscyber.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Operation_Armageddon_Final.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Middle East\n\n\n###### Furthering Turkey’s strategic interests\n\nIn January 2020, it was reported that DNS\nhijacking[101] attacks targeting organisations in\nEurope and the Middle East were conducted in\nalignment to Turkish interests.[102] The hijacked\ndomains were reported to primarily include those of\nTurkey’s near neighbours including government\nentities, and civilian organisations within Turkey\nitself. From our assessment, this activity aligned\nwith the known targeting and tactics of the Turkeybased threat actor Teal Kurma (a.k.a. Sea Turtle).[103]\nDNS hijacking was a prominent technique in 2019\nfor Teal Kurma, during which it was seen to\ncompromise organisations to gain access to\ncredentials to change DNS records and even target\nDNS registrars themselves.\n\nTurkey’s role on the global stage is becoming\nincreasingly prominent as it aggressively pursues\nits own interests, and thus is changing the status\nquo of decades-long alliances. Tensions intensified\nduring the course of 2020 amongst Turkey and its\nnear neighbours, including Cyprus and Greece,\nover disputed waters in the Eastern Mediterranean\nin which Turkey has conducted seismic\nexploration.[104] The countries hold competing claims\nover the maritime and energy interests in the area\nand the rights to explore and exploit oil and gas\nreserves. On the cyber stage, this has been\nreflected in hacktivist activity from Greece and\nTurkey-based groups in tit-for-tat activity, with each\nside claiming to have compromised prominent\nwebsites.[105]\n\n\nPresidential elections were held within Northern\nCyprus in October 2020, the result of which was\nanticipated to have a significant impact on Turkey’s\ninterests in the region, not least in its pursuit of oil\nand gas reserves within Cypriot waters. In October\n2020, PwC identified a macro-enabled Microsoft\nWord document lure related to the Northern Cyprus\nPresidential elections which we attributed to the\nTurkey-based threat actor Teal Dev 2 (a.k.a.\nPromethium).[106] The resulting dropped malware\nincluded the abuse of legitimate software which\nwas used to sideload malicious DLLs. The TTPs\nused in the infection chain bore strong similarities\nto those seen in StrongPity, a malware family\nattributed to Teal Dev 2.[107] The threat actor\nmaintained a high level of StrongPity activity during\n2020, however, we have not previously seen it using\nmacro-enabled documents as a delivery\nmechanism before. From our analysis of the\nmalware and the related infrastructure, we found\nsimilar samples going back to 2018, indicating that\nthe threat actor has been using this technique and\nmalware variant for some time, albeit from our\ntelemetry, sparingly.\n\n\n###### Turkey’s role on the global stage is becoming increasingly prominent as it aggressively pursues its own interests.\n\n\n101 \u0007DNS hijacking refers to a threat actor compromising credentials that allows it to manipulate DNS records, giving it the ability to redirect traffic to threat actor\n\ncontrolled infrastructure and capture sensitive information.\n\n[102 \u0007‘Exclusive: Hackers acting in Turkey’s interests believed to be behind recent cyberattacks – sources’, Reuters, https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-at­](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-attack-hijack-exclusive/exclusive-hackers-acting-in-turkeys-interests-believed-to-be-behind-recent-cyberattacks-sources-idUSKBN1ZQ10X)\n\n[tack-hijack-exclusive/exclusive-hackers-acting-in-turkeys-interests-believed-to-be-behind-recent-cyberattacks-sources-idUSKBN1ZQ10X (27th January 2020)](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-attack-hijack-exclusive/exclusive-hackers-acting-in-turkeys-interests-believed-to-be-behind-recent-cyberattacks-sources-idUSKBN1ZQ10X)\n\n103 \u0007‘Furthering Turkish state interests though cyber operations’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-SIB-20200323-01A\n\n[104 \u0007‘Turkey extends exploration in disputed Mediterranean waters to October 27’, Reuters, https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-turkey-greece-ship/turkey-extends-ex­](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-turkey-greece-ship/turkey-extends-exploration-in-disputed-mediterranean-waters-to-october-27-idUKKBN27702D)\n\n[ploration-in-disputed-mediterranean-waters-to-october-27-idUKKBN27702D (22nd October 2020)](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-turkey-greece-ship/turkey-extends-exploration-in-disputed-mediterranean-waters-to-october-27-idUKKBN27702D)\n\n[105 \u0007‘Battle for Supremacy | Hacktivists from Turkey and Greece Exchange Virtual Blows’, SentinelOne, https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/battle-for-suprema­](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/battle-for-supremacy-hacktivists-from-turkey-and-greece-exchange-virtual-blows/)\n\n[cy-hacktivists-from-turkey-and-greece-exchange-virtual-blows/ (21st January 2020)](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/battle-for-supremacy-hacktivists-from-turkey-and-greece-exchange-virtual-blows/)\n\n106 \u0007‘Pity the pivot’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20201008-03A\n\n107 \u0007‘Pity the Pelican’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20201021-02A\n\n[108 \u0007‘Iran attack: US troops targeted with ballistic missiles’, BBC, https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-51028954 (8th January 2019)](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-51028954)\n\n109 \u0007‘Iran-based threat actor responses to rising geopolitical tensions’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-SIB-20200108-01A\n\n110 \u0007‘Cyber Threats 2019: A Year in Retrospect’, PwC Threat Intelligence, https://www.pwc.co.uk/issues/cyber-security-services/insights/cyber-threats-2019-retro­\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Iran’s proportional response\n\nOn 3rd January 2020, Iranian General Qasem\nSoleimani was killed by a US drone strike. This\ninevitably escalated existing political tensions\nbetween the US and Iran, with Iranian officials\nquick to indicate there would be a swift and\nproportional response. Whilst this prompted Iran to\ntake kinetic measures against military bases\nhosting US military personnel in Iraq,[108] the initial\nresponse in the cyber domain was more muted\nthan expected. This came in the form of website\ndefacements conducted by self-reported pro-Iran\nhacktivists, and highly likely committed on an\nindependent basis.[109]\n\nNo sophisticated cyber attacks were reported\nfollowing Soleimani’s death, at least in the public\ndomain, nor did our telemetry indicate any\nsignificant shift in Iran-based threat actor\nbehaviours in the immediate or medium term\nfollowing this event. This was unexpected; Iranbased threat actors are particularly proficient in the\nrealm of destructive cyber attacks, and an attack of\nthis type could have been considered a\nproportional response to the drone strike. Following\nactivity involving StoneDrill, ZeroCleare and\nDustman wiper malware families in 2019,[110] major\ndestructive attacks were noticeably absent from\nIran-based cyber activity in 2020.\n\nHowever, Iran-based threat actors were far from\nquiet in 2020. Economic sanctions, numerous\nindictments and shifting alliances within the Middle\nEast have all likely played a part in cyber activity\nconducted over the course of the year, as evident in\na series of tit-for-tat incidents between Iran and\nIsrael, with whom Iran continues to share a volatile\nrelationship. Following reported cyber attacks on\nIsrael’s water and waste management facilities in\nApril 2020, Iran’s Shahid Rajaee port terminal was\nallegedly compromised in May, with media articles\nsubsequently attributing the attack to Israel.[111]\nThis sparked a series of incidents affecting Iranian\norganisations and facilities prompting questions\naround whether Iran was being repeatedly\ntargeted by sabotage attacks of either a cyber or\nkinetic nature.[112]\n\n\nCyber attacks targeting Israeli organisations have\nalso been in the spotlight. In Operation Quicksand,\nPowGoop, a downloader likely associated with the\nespionage motivated Iran-based threat actor Yellow\nNix (a.k.a. MuddyWater) was identified on the\nsystems of an Israel-based organisation.[113] The\nransomware family Pay2Key was also used to\ntarget a number of Israeli organisations in\nNovember 2020,[114] with multiple commonalities\nbetween this activity and the known modus\noperandi of Iran-based threat actor Yellow Dev 15\n(a.k.a. Pioneer Kitten). As the threat actor has\npreviously engaged in financially motivated\nactivities and likely has the capability to deploy\nransomware to victims, this escalation can be\nconsidered a progression from its known\nmotivations.[115]\n\n###### Yellow Nix steps up\n\nYellow Nix had a busy year, expanding its targeting\nfocus from its near neighbours in the Middle East,\nto include European entities. Alongside this shift, it\nmade significant efforts to diversify its technical\narsenal, and broaden its range of attack vectors.\nThis included the development of two malware\nfamilies:\n\n\n###### Forelord\n\n\n### 1\n\n\nThis is a DLL which uses DNS tunneling for network\ncommunication, the first time we have seen Yellow Nix\nusing this technique.

We observed Yellow Nix\ndelivering the commercial remote administration tool,\nRemote Utilities, to retain remote access to a\ncompromised victim.[119] This application allows the\nthreat actor to remotely access a victim’s device with\nfull privileges, and was configured to send\nconnectivity details to the operator using a predefined\nemail address. From our observations, Yellow Nix has\nused Remote Utilities since at least October 2019\nthrough to September 2020, which indicates that this\nhas likely proven an effective tool in compromising its\nvictims, perhaps even more so in 2020, given the\nincreased use of remote tools.\n\nYellow Nix’s attempts to leverage new tools and\ntechniques over the past year indicate a step change\nin tactics. This may in part be an effort to shift away\nfrom its existing arsenal, some of which was notably\nleaked in 2019.[120] In any case, Yellow Nix has shown\nitself to be a versatile threat actor; although we\ncontinue to observe it fall back on its tried and tested\ntechniques, during 2020 it made considerable\nadvances in its sophistication, shifting from VBScript\nand PowerShell payloads to developing multiple\nvariants of bespoke malware.\n\n###### Yellow Liderc\n\nYellow Liderc (a.k.a. Tortoiseshell) is an Islamic\nRevolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) aligned threat\nactor, which PwC associates with a private sector\nIranian entity. The threat actor first came into\nprominence in 2018, and remained active\nthroughout 2020, with infrastructure management\nactivities and intrusion operations aligning closely\nto the standard Iranian Saturday to Thursday\nworking week. In contrast to 2019, where the threat\nactor made more frequent use of its rudimentary\nbespoke malware families and phishing campaigns,\n2020 saw increased efforts to target key corporates\nvia social engineering across multiple social and\nchat platforms.\n\n\n###### Yellow Liderc’s targeting typically falls in\n three categories:\n\n\n**Direct targeting of the Kingdom of**\n**Saudi Arabia**\n\n\nThis encompasses organisations in a wide variety\nof sectors, including petrochemicals, IT managed\nservice providers and IT consultants, business\nprocess outsourcers, transport, financial services,\ngovernment and defence.\n\n\n**Upstream/downstream targeting**\n\n\nMany Yellow Liderc targets appear to have direct\nrelationships with Saudi Arabia and we assess that\nrelationship is the primary reason for Yellow\nLiderc’s interest in them. These include India-based\nIT managed services providers (MSPs), financial\nsoftware and technology companies such as\nenterprise resource planning (ERP) providers,\nMiddle East engineering and construction\ncompanies, and business technology consultants.\n\n\n**Aviation, aerospace and**\n**automotive**\n\n\nTargeting of engine manufacturers (e.g. turbofans,\naircraft engines and automotive engines), large\naerospace and defence manufacturers, and several\nlow cost European airlines.\n\n\n119 \u0007‘Yellow Nix the one click wonder’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20200914-02A\n\n[120 \u0007‘New leaks of Iranian cyber-espionage operations hit Telegram and the Dark Web’, ZDNet, https://www.zdnet.com/article/new-leaks-of-iranian-cyber-espionage-](https://www.zdnet.com/article/new-leaks-of-iranian-cyber-espionage-operations-hit-telegram-and-the-dark-web/)\n\nti hit t l d th d k b/ (9th M 2019\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Information operations\n\n###### Information operations often seek to exploit existing societal divisions or wider conspiracy theories in an attempt to influence a narrative or effect a desired outcome. They may also exploit data that has been exfiltrated as part of a cyber espionage campaign. Social media platforms in particular have come under an increasing amount of scrutiny over the type of information that is propagated over these channels, and the often lack of robust scrutiny or challenge with which this is done.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Election interference\n\nIn relation to elections, the term ‘information\noperations’ has often become synonymous with\n‘election hacking’, although the latter encompasses\na wider array of activity including technical\ncompromises and disruption tactics. Interference\nfrom Russia-based threat actors in the 2016 US\npresidential election was a watershed moment in\nthe awareness of ‘election hacking’ and called into\nquestion the robustness of democratic process.[121]\n\nIn October 2020, US national security officials\nwarned that both Iran and Russia had obtained\nsome voter registration data and were attempting\nto sow ‘unrest’ ahead of the November 2020\npresidential election, potentially by communicating\nfalse information to registered voters.[122] It was\nindicated that Iran spread disinformation related to\nthe US presidential election by masquerading as a\nfar-right pro-Trump group to disseminate emails\ndesigned to ‘intimidate voters and cause social\nunrest’.[123] In some cases, a ‘propaganda video’ was\nused to perpetuate rumours of manipulation\nconcerning the mail-in vote process. It is important\nto note there was no indication that election\nsystems had been compromised as some voter\nregistration data was likely already available in the\npublic domain or potentially leaked in previous\nunrelated breaches.\n\nA related advisory[124] from the US Cybersecurity\nand Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and\nFederal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) indicated that\nan unnamed Iran-based threat actor, which we\ntrack as Yellow Dev 19, exploited US state\nwebsites, including election-related websites, in an\nattempt to obtain voter registration information. The\nthreat actor reportedly used Acunetix vulnerability\nscanner, a web security scanning tool, and\nleveraged known vulnerabilities including SQL\ninjections, webshell uploads, and what the\nadvisory describes as ‘unique flaws’ against\ntargeted websites.\n\n\nAlthough we have not seen a repeat of the 2016\nactivity, the impact of such influence or sabotage\noperations on democratic process, and in\nparticular the role that social media platforms play\nin this, is likely to remain under scrutiny in\nthe future.\n\n###### COVID-19\n\nIn addition to some of the malicious cyber\ncampaigns that have targeted organisations or\nsectors involved in the fight against COVID-19, as\noutlined in the earlier section of this report, there\nhas also been a deluge of both misinformation and\ndisinformation related to the pandemic. Such\nactivity has included state-sponsored information\noperations interacting with organic communities of\nonline users to spread disinformation, validating\nalready existing ill-formed and ill-informed\ncontrarian opinions.[125]\n\nOn one hand, in 2020 we saw misinformation being\nshared online in the form of misleading statistics,\nhealthcare information, potential cures or\ntreatment, origins of the outbreak, and authorities’\nresponses to the pandemic. This also extended to\nconspiracy theories, such as that the roll-out of 5G\ntechnology being linked to the virus’ spread. We\nalso saw disinformation likely aimed at disrupting\npublic order or manipulating an agenda,\ncapitalising on recent events. The motivation\nbehind this could range from economic gain, such\nas online scams, to political purposes. For\nexample, a European task force that tracks\ndisinformation released a report[126] in June 2020\nthat examined how a Russian media contractor was\nsurreptitiously pushing out disinformation to other\nEuropean websites.[127]\n\n\n121 \u0007‘Hacking the 2020 US election’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-SIB-20201027-01A\n\n[122 \u0007‘Iran and Russia Seek to Influence Election in Final Days, U.S. Officials Warn’, The New York Times, https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/21/us/politics/iran-rus­](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/21/us/politics/iran-russia-election-interference.html)\n\n[sia-election-interference.html (21st October 2020)](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/21/us/politics/iran-russia-election-interference.html)\n\n123 ‘Learning on the job with Yellow Dev 19’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20201118-02A\n\n[124 ‘Alert (AA20-304A) Iranian Advanced Persistent Threat Actor Identified Obtaining Voter Registration Data’, CISA, https://uscert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-304a](https://uscert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-304a)\n\n125 ‘Corona non grata’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-SIB-20200423-01A\n\n126 \u0007‘How two information portals hide their ties to the Russian news agency InfoRos’, EU Disinfo Lab,\n\n[‘https://www.disinfo.eu/publications/how-two-information-portals-hide-their-ties-to-the-russian-news-agency-inforos/ (15th June 2020)](https://www.disinfo.eu/publications/how-two-information-portals-hide-their-ties-to-the-russian-news-agency-inforos/)\n\n[127 ‘US officials: Russia behind spread of virus disinformation’ AP News https://apnews com/3acb089e6a333e051dbc4a465cb68ee1 (28th July 2020)](https://apnews.com/3acb089e6a333e051dbc4a465cb68ee1)\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Blurring the lines\n\n###### For the majority of threat actors, their activities, however varied, broadly align to a single overarching motivation, be that intelligence gathering or financial gain. Of course, there have always been those that buck the trend – North Korea-based threat actors are a prime example of this having previously conducted espionage, crime, sabotage and hacktivist activities in line with shifting strategic objectives. Over recent years, there has been an increasing overlap in the activity of long standing espionage threat actors being linked to financially motivated activity, as a result of shifting objectives or personal gain.\n\n Hacker-for-hire operations have also blurred the traditional understanding of espionage activities, where activity conducted for multiple end users may be performed by a single private entity. Whilst this type of activity is not new, 2020 saw a number of such operations exposed in the public domain.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Espionage heart, criminal mind\n\nIn a continuing trend, an increasing number of\nthreat actors portray dual motivations – seemingly\nusing their tradecraft to conduct both espionage\nand financially motivated activity. In a divergence\nfrom 2019, throughout 2020 we observed more\nactivity that is likely being conducted for personal\ngain as opposed to a wider shift in operational\nobjectives to generate revenue. This poses an\nincreasing threat to a wide variety of sectors and\norganisations as the targeting does not necessarily\nalign to what is expected, nor does the tooling align\nto traditional cyber crime activity. This widely\nvarying range of TTPs complicates both defence\nand attribution efforts.\n\nActivity of this sort that emerged in 2020 is\nassociated with threat actors emanating from\nmultiple regions:\n\n- Several individuals tied to China-based threat\n\nactor Red Kelpie were observed conducting\ncyber attacks targeting over 100 victim\norganisations across multiple sectors. The\nintent behind these attacks was to not just steal\nsource code and customer account information,\nbut to also create access for deployment of\nfurther payloads expressly for personal financial\ngain, such as ransomware and cryptojacking\nschemes.[128,129]\n\n- An individual thought to be tied to the Russia\nbased threat actor Blue Echidna (a.k.a.\nSandworm, Voodoo Bear) was found to be\nengaging in spear phishing campaigns for\npersonal profit, targeting numerous sectors\nincluding asset and wealth management, retail\nand cryptocurrency.[130]\n\n- PwC’s research into Iran-based criminal\n\nactivities revealed a number of overlaps\nbetween individuals connected to both criminal\noperations and Iran-based espionage threat\nactors. Indictments released in 2020 indicated\nseveral individuals associated with Yellow\n\n\nGeryon (a.k.a. Rocket Kitten) and Yellow Dev 15\nhad used their offensive tradecraft for personal\nfinancial gain, often attempting to extort the\nvictim after stealing sensitive information from\nthem.[131,132] We assess the motivations behind\nthese multiple cases of Iran-based threat actors\nconducting both espionage and criminal\noperations stems from the conditions within\nwhich the threat actors operate, where ‘only the\nbest individuals or teams succeed, are paid,\nand remain in business.’ These conditions\nsubsequently drive threat actors, less able to\ncompete, to seek out alternative or\nsupplementary sources of income.[134]\n\n- North Korean activity groups continued to\n\nconduct a blend of espionage and financially\nmotivated attacks in 2020. Black Banshee and\nBlack Artemis have been observed targeting\norganisations in the financial services sector,\nincluding cryptocurrency exchanges.[135 ]This\ntype of dual-hat activity has become fairly\ntypical,[136] and is relatively unique in that the\nrevenue generated from these criminal\nintrusions is assessed to likely fuel the North\nKorean state’s strategic aims, rather than being\nconducted for personal gain.[137,138]\n\n- Pakistan-based Gorgon Group (a.k.a. Aggah),\n\nwhich PwC assesses to be the cyber crime\nfocussed element of the dual-motivated threat\nactor Green Havildar, was extremely active in\n2020, using a number of malicious PowerPoint\nand Excel documents in order to target\nnumerous victims across the world.[139] This\nthreat actor has a preference for commodity\nmalware such as AgentTesla, which it can use\nfor both espionage and criminal activities (i.e.\ninformation collection on the target, or\nintellectual property theft to later be sold on the\nDark Web).\n\n\n128 ‘A counterstrike on the money’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-SIB-20200930-01A\n\n[129 \u0007‘USA v Jiang Lizhi, Qian Chuan, Fu Qiang’, United States District Court for the District of Columbia, https://www.justice.gov/opa/pressrelease/file/1317206/](https://apnews.com/3acb089e6a333e051dbc4a465cb68ee1)\n\n[download (11th August 2020)](https://apnews.com/3acb089e6a333e051dbc4a465cb68ee1)\n\n[130 https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1328521/download](https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1328521/download)\n\n131 ‘Money and intelligence – can a threat actor have it all’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-SIB-20201023-01A\n\n132 \u0007‘Two Iranian Nationals Charged in Cyber Theft Campaign Targeting Computer Systems in United States, Europe, and the Middle East’, US Department of\n\n[Justice Office of Public Affairs, https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-iranian-nationals-charged-cyber-theft-campaign-targeting-computer-systems-unit­](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-iranian-nationals-charged-cyber-theft-campaign-targeting-computer-systems-united-states?s=08)\n[ed-states?s=08 (16th September 2020)](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-iranian-nationals-charged-cyber-theft-campaign-targeting-computer-systems-united-states?s=08)\n\n[133 ‘Iran’s Hacker Hierarchy Exposed’, Recorded Future, https://www.recordedfuture.com/iran-hacker-hierarchy (9th May 2018)](https://www.recordedfuture.com/iran-hacker-hierarchy)\n\n134 ‘Money and intelligence – can a threat actor have it all’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-SIB-20201023-01A\n\n135 ‘Artemis Banshee and Shoggoth walk into a bar’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20200630-02A\n\n136 ‘Mixed intentions’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20191106-01A\n\n137 \u0007‘North Korean crypto hacking: Separating fact from fiction’, CoinTelegraph,\n\n[https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/2020/10/09/north-korean-crypto-hacking-separating-fact-from-fiction (9th October 2020)](https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/2020/10/09/north-korean-crypto-hacking-separating-fact-from-fiction)\n\n138 \u0007‘United States Files Complaint to Forfeit 280 Cryptocurrency Accounts Tied to Hacks of Two Exchanges by North Korean Actors’, US Department of Justice,\n\n[https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/united-states-files-complaint-forfeit-280-cryptocurrency-accounts-tied-hacks-two-exchanges (27th August 2020)](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/united-states-files-complaint-forfeit-280-cryptocurrency-accounts-tied-hacks-two-exchanges)\n\n139 \u0007‘Cyber-Criminal espionage Operation insists on Italian Manufacturing’, Yoroi,\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Hacker-for-hire groups\n\nMercenary espionage groups, more commonly\nknown as hackers-for-hire, offer different\nchallenges to the cyber security community than\nstandard espionage threats, despite deploying\nsimilar TTPs to their nation-state counterparts.\nThese include:\n\n**• Unpredictability in targeting – whilst threat**\n\nintelligence teams are able to build up profiles\nof nation-state groups based on their country of\norigin and political events affecting it, hackerfor-hire groups follow the money.

Orange Abtu, Amanda Lovers) were\nplaced squarely in the middle of a lawsuit accusing\nthem of compromising and stealing sensitive\ninformation of an American businessman for a\nclient based in the Middle East.[140] BellTroX has\nseparately also been found to have conducted\noperations on hundreds of individuals and\norganisations on behalf of other clients.[141] PwC’s\nanalysis was able to not only tie CyberRoot and\nBellTroX together, but also find links to another\ngroup: Appin Security Group, which is suspected to\nhave been responsible for the 2013 attack on a\n\n\nNorwegian telecommunications company.[142] The\nfindings outline a string of newly created private\nsecurity organisations operating out of India,\nconducting hacker-for-hire espionage operations\nagainst a variety of sectors on behalf of clients.[143 ]\n\nThis illustrates that despite operations being\nousted, these hacker-for-hire groups are adaptive,\nand will more often than not find a way to restart\ntheir campaigns.\n\n**DeathStalker APT has been active since at least**\nas early as 2018 and increased the number and\ndiversity of its operations in 2020.[144] It operates\nseveral bespoke malware families which allows it to\nconduct stealthy corporate espionage operations\nfor clients on a large scale creating new backdoors\nin order to increase their capabilities.[145]\nDeathstalker’s malware has been found in\nnumerous countries, with the threat actor mostly\nfocusing on targets within the financial and\nlegal sectors.\n\n**CostaRico APT has targeted organisations across**\nseveral continents and a variety of sectors, with a\nheavy focus on South Asia. The origins of this\ngroup remain elusive, but with a number of\nrelatively advanced defence evasion techniques\n(such as creating multiple SSH tunnels on a victim’s\nmachine) as well as a bespoke backdoor –\nSombRAT – this threat actor can be considered a\nsophisticated cyber mercenary group.

The overwhelming majority, 71% of incidents, were the result of criminal threat actors. 2020 was no different, with 86% attributable to cyber criminals.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile ransomware was a major threat in 2019, it has dominated the headlines in the last 12 months, largely\ndue to a major shift in the TTPs employed by multiple ransomware threat actors:\n\n\nMany threat actors now\nexfiltrate data from their\nvictims before they encrypt\ntheir victims’ files.\n\n\nOf those which do exfiltrate\ndata, many announce that\nthey have compromised a\nvictim on a leak site\n(typically hosted on the\ndark web) and provide\n‘proofs’ that they have\ndownloaded data from\ntheir victims.\n\n\nThese threat actors set a\ndeadline by which a ransom\nmust be paid. If the victim\nrefuses to pay, stolen data\nis published on the leak\nsite, adding data protection\nand regulatory issues to the\nchallenges of restoring\noperations.\n\n\nThis is in marked contrast to ransomware operations last year, which were largely conducted in secret.\nThe use of leak sites has almost certainly achieved its objective of increasing the pressure on victims to\npay ransom demands. It has also provided a clear insight into the operational tempo of many ransomware\noperations. The scale and intensity of ransomware incidents in 2020 was striking, making ransomware the\nmost significant cyber security threat faced by organisations, irrespective of their industry sector\nor location.\n\n**Figure 4 – Running total of ransomware leak site publications in 2020**\n\n\n1400\n\n1200\n\n\n1000\n\n800\n\n\n600\n\n400\n\n\n200\n\n0\nJan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug\n\n\nSep Oct Nov Dec\n\n\nMonth (2020)\n\n\n-----\n\n###### What is driving the growth\n in attacks?\n\n Profit\n\nThere was a sharp increase in the number of\nransomware actors in 2020, following a trend\nalready established in 2019. This was likely the\nresult of high profile ransomware incidents and, in\ncases where details of ransom payments entered\nthe public domain, the perceived profitability of\nhuman-operated ransomware attacks. This is\nattracting new players into the market. Recent\narrivals include the ransomware systems such as\nDarkside, SunCrypt, Egregor, and Everest.\n\nThe growth in ransomware operations is not\nconfined to new threat actors. Many established\ncriminal groups have already added ransomware to\ntheir portfolios. Banking trojans such as Emotet,\nDridex and TrickBot are now more commonly used\nas the initial delivery mechanism in targeted\nransomware attacks. The threat actor which we\ntrack as White Austaras (a.k.a.TA505) introduced\nCL0P ransomware at the end of 2019. The latest\nthreat actor to make this switch is White Horoja,\nwhich controls the banking trojan Qakbot. Since\nMarch 2020, Qakbot has been used in the delivery\nof ProLock and DoppelPaymer ransomware and\nmost recently, Egregor.[148]\n\nThe shift by established criminal actors towards\nransomware is likely driven by opportunity costs.\nSuccessful online banking attacks rely on complex\nmoney laundering operations to receive stolen\nfunds and transfer the proceeds to bank accounts\nunder criminal control. The specialist criminals who\nprovide money laundering services demand high\ncommissions, whereas ransom payments are\nusually paid directly to cryptocurrency wallets\nalready controlled by the attackers. As a\nconsequence, ransomware operations are\nalmost certainly more profitable than online\nbanking attacks.\n\n\n###### Case study\n\n**Netwalker ransomware incident**\n\nPwC’s Incident Response team responded to a Netwalker\nransomware incident where the threat actor gained access to the\nvictim’s network six weeks prior to the execution of the\nransomware. Its access was gained through the use of\ncompromised accounts to log in to external remote access\nservices which did not require multi-factor authentication. The\nthreat actor moved laterally through the environment by dumping\ncredentials from the operating system of compromised hosts\nusing Mimikatz, conducting network scans to identify targets and\nhosts to pivot to as it went. Using this method, it was able to gain\naccess to a highly privileged account. The threat actor then was\nable to use this access to disable antivirus software and execute\nthe Netwalker ransomware across the network. At the time, the\nthreat actor did not steal data and threaten to publish it on the\ndark web, but it changed its tactics several months after this\nattack, and future victims were not so ‘lucky’ to be affected by\n‘only’ the ransomware itself.\n\n\nWe assess that several of the most significant\nransomware threats, including Ryuk/Conti and\nWastedLocker, continue to be run privately.\nThey are operated by criminal enterprises whose\nleadership has been active for over a decade and\nwhich comprise many of the most sophisticated\nand experienced criminal actors we currently track.\nThese threat actors are largely secretive and no\nlonger participate in the criminal forums or\nmarketplaces frequented by less-established\nactors. Instead, they either have all of the resources\nthey need in-house, or, where they do need to bring\nin external expertise or recruit additional talent,\nthey employ private communication channels to do\nso. Established players can draw on an extensive\nlist of trusted contacts they have accumulated over\ntheir extensive criminal careers.\n\n\n-----\n\n|Scalability • The same threat actor raised Sodinokibi’s profile yet further by taking part in an While the number of threat actors has interview on a Russian-language social increased, in some cases the scale and pace media channel on 23 October, in which he of their operations have also grown. Many of claimed that the ransomware operation had the ransomware threat actors we track, netted USD 100 million in 12 months.152 including Sodinokibi, Nefilim, NetWalker and Suncrypt, are run as affiliate programmes.149 The threat actors in control of the ransomware are responsible for the development and Figure 5 – Sodinokibi’s million dollar gesture management of the malware. They provide access to the ransomware to their affiliates whose role is to conduct attacks. Ransom payments are deposited by victims into cryptocurrency wallets controlled by the ransomware developer and then shared with the affiliates in a pre-agreed profit sharing arrangement. In the case of Sodinokibi, the primary threat actor controls negotiations with victims; much the same applies with Suncrypt which claims to have a dedicated blackmail team (команда по шантажу) to handle ransom negotiations. The revenue of affiliate programmes is derived from the expertise of the affiliates involved in compromising target networks. The larger the number and the greater the skill of the recruits Figure 6 – Thanos private ransomware builder on to an affiliate programme, the more revenue forums that programme will generate. This has introduced a degree of competition to attract skilled operatives, with rival threat actors adopting different approaches to recruitment: • NetWalker has claimed its profit sharing arrangements are more favourable than rival affiliate programmes (including Sodinokibi) and posted details of payouts from successful attacks.150 • When the threat actor in control of Sodinokibi relaunched its recruitment programme in September, it deposited the equivalent of USD 1 million into a cryptocurrency account linked to its profile on a criminal forum where it recruits affiliates. The threat actor claimed that the deposit was proof of the success of the Sodinokibi programme and the level of accessible funds it had at its disposal.151|Col2|Col3|\n|---|---|---|\n||||\n||||\n||||\n||||\n|||sale in criminal|\n||||\n||||\n||||\n\n\n149 \u0007‘Nefilim’s immediate impact’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20200512-01A\n\n150 \u0007‘The rise of NetWalker’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20200612-02A\n\n151 \u0007‘Sodinokibi – The Beast Grows’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20201008-01A\n\n[152 \u0007YouTube, ‘ЭЛИТНЫЕ ХАКЕРЫ REVIL: КАК ЗАРАБОТАТЬ $100 000 000 НА ШИФРОВАЛЬЩИКЕ? ‘https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyQCQ1VZp8s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyQCQ1VZp8s)\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Barriers to entry are dropping\n\nIn Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) schemes, the\ndeveloper sells access to the malware for a one-off\nfee. The products are usually marketed as\n‘builders’, in that the purchaser can configure the\nransomware through a graphic user interface (GUI)\nwhich then compiles the malware into a working\nbinary. In addition to a one-off fee, some RaaS\nschemes offer a subscription service which\nprovides users with ‘rebuilds’ to reduce antivirus\ndetections and/or updates when new features\nbecome available.\n\nRaaS schemes are sold on criminal marketplaces\nand many are marketed as a better alternative to\naffiliate programmes: after the initial purchase is\nmade, the threat actor keeps 100% of any revenue\ngenerated from its attacks.[153] RaaS schemes have\nlowered the entry bar to ransomware operations as\nall that is required to obtain a working malware\npackage is the funds to make the purchase and\naccess to the criminal marketplaces where they are\nsold. Many of these packages are sold with\nextensive ‘how to’ guides and tutorials posted on\nsocial media platforms, meaning that relative\nnewcomers to cyber crime can obtain a working\ncapability without previous experience. To\ncomplicate matters further, the source code for a\nnumber of ransomware variants, including Dharma,\nGandCrab and others, has been leaked and has\nresulted in a proliferation of malware derivatives,\ndubbed ‘Frankenstein code’ in criminal forums.\n\nWe assess that RaaS threat actors are more likely\nto target small and medium-sized enterprises\n(SMEs), whereas affiliate programmes and private\nransomware operations are more likely to attack\nlarger organisations. This is because RaaS\ncustomers often do not possess the requisite\nskills needed to attack and exploit large,\ncomplex networks.\n\n###### Established actors have raised their game\n\nTwo of the most established and prominent\nransomware threat actors have upgraded their\nsystems in 2020. BitPaymer, a ransomware variant\noperated by the threat actor with the self-styled\nname ‘Evil Corp’ (a.k.a. the Dridex Group), was first\nintroduced in 2017.[154]\n\n\n**Figure 7 – The RANION RaaS is marketed on multiple**\n**criminal forums**\n\nAlthough the threat actor added some incremental\nimprovements to the code, the core system has\nremained largely unchanged since its introduction.\nIn 2020, ‘Evil Corp’ launched a new ransomware\nproject known as WastedLocker, which was\nresponsible for high profile attacks from the outset.\nUnlike BitPaymer, which was partially derived from\nthe source code for the Dridex banking trojan,\nWastedLocker was written from scratch.[155]\n\nRyuk, one of the most serious ransomware threats\nto organisations, was first introduced in 2018. Ryuk\noperations were at a high tempo throughout 2019,\nwhich continued into Q1 2020. During this period,\nRyuk was mainly delivered by a combination of\nEmotet and TrickBot. Ryuk then went through a\ndormant phase and did not re-emerge until Q3\n2020. In parallel with Ryuk’s dormant phase, a new\nransomware variant, Conti, emerged. Like\nWastedLocker, Conti has been written from\nscratch, but based on coding similarities and the\nnaming conventions used in files and commands,\nwe assess it has been written by the threat actor in\ncontrol of Ryuk.[156] Ryuk’s apparent disappearance\nduring Q2 2020 prompted speculation that it had\nbeen supplanted by Conti. However, by September\n2020 Ryuk had re-emerged but had switched\ndelivery mechanisms to BazarLoader and\nBuer loader.\n\n\n153 \u0007‘We have liftoff – analysis of the Buran/Zeppelin ransomware programme’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20200330-01A\n\n154 \u0007‘Rezident evil: Dridex indictments’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-SIB-20200102-01A\n\n155 \u0007‘WastedLocker – Evil Corp’s new smoking gun’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20200730-01A\n\n\n-----\n\nThe development of new ransomware variants is\nlikely in response to improvements in defensive\nsecurity. Whether variants have been written from\nscratch like Conti and WastedLocker, or\nincremental improvements have been introduced to\nestablished systems, there has been a drive to\nenhance the speed of encryption routines and\ndefence evasion techniques. The intention of these\nimprovements is clear: to reduce the risk of\ndetection when the malware is first deployed on the\nnetwork and/or to ensure encryption routines\nfunction as quickly as possible to prevent\ndisruption of an attack while it is still underway.\n\n###### The changing face of ransomware operations\n\nAs noted in the introduction, the advent of leak sites\nbecame one of the most striking elements of the\nransomware phenomenon in 2020. Each time data is\nexposed on a leak site it represents an attack that\nfailed to extort a ransom payment from a victim. It\nwould be dangerous to infer that such attacks have\nhad no impact; in many cases those incidents are\nlikely to have caused significant disruption.\nAssessing the scale and tempo of ransomware\noperations based on how frequently threat actors\nexpose stolen data on leak sites is inherently risky;\nseveral sophisticated threat actors, including those\nin control of Ryuk or WastedLocker, do not employ\nleak sites at all. Nevertheless, in 2020 at least 25\ndifferent actors have joined the leak site bandwagon\nsince the first site was created by the actor in control\nof Maze ransomware. Some, like Light ransomware,\nhave been short lived; others, have rebranded\nthemselves (e.g. AKO changed its name to Ranzy);\n\n\nwhile others, such as Sodinokibi and DoppelPaymer\nhave been active throughout the year.\n\nSince the beginning of the year, some 1,330 victims\nhave had their data exposed, with the\noverwhelming majority (79%) of these leaks\noccurring in the second half of the year. This\nreflects the arrival of a series of aggressive\nransomware operations which has driven up the\nnumber of incidents. But this figure belies the\nchanging fortunes of some of the most prominent\nransomware operations.\n\nIn the first half of 2020, the threat actors in control\nof Maze and Sodinokibi were dominant, with new\narrivals to ransomware operations beginning to\nmake an impact.\n\nBy Q4 2020, many more threat actors were active,\nwith Egregor becoming one of the most prolific. The\nsectors most frequently targeted were Retail &\nConsumer and Manufacturing, although no sector is\nimmune to ransomware incidents.\n\n\n###### Since the beginning of the year, some 1,330 victims have had\n their data exposed, with the overwhelming majority (79%) of these leaks occurring in the second half of the year.\n\n\n###### Case study\n\n**Nefilim ransomware incident**\n\nPwC’s Incident Response team responded to an\nincident in which a threat actor was observed to\nhave gained access to the victim’s environment just\na week prior to the execution of a Nefilim\nransomware attack, with half of this time dedicated\nto extracting files from the victim’s environment.\nThe threat actor’s initial access was through the\ncompromised credentials of a software vendor who\nprovided support to the victim for the vendor’s\napplication. These credentials were used to gain\naccess to the victim’s environment via a remote\naccess solution. Once inside, the threat actor\nused Cobalt Strike to establish persistence and C2,\nand used Mimikatz and Cobalt Strike to expand\nits access and gain access to more\nprivileged accounts\n\n\nHaving obtained privileged access, the threat actor\nidentified a file server of interest and used its\naccess to copy files from this server, stage them on\nother compromised systems, and upload them to\ncloud services controlled by the attacker. After\nextracting this data, the threat actor executed the\nransomware, and threatened to publish the stolen\nfiles online unless a ransom was paid. After a week\nof non-payment, the victim’s executives were\nthreatened directly via email that the organisation’s\nfiles would be released.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 8 – Ransomware incidents Q2 2020**\n\nSodinokibi **22%**\n\n\n###### 5%\n\n 12%\n\n 35%\n\n\nCL0P\n\nDoppelPaymer\n\nMaze\n\n\nRagnar\n\nPysa\n\nNetWalker\n\nNefilim\n\n\n###### 3%\n\n 10%\n\n 10%\n\n 3%\n\n\n**Figure 9 – Ransomware incidents Q4 2020**\n\nAko/Ranzy **1%** **2%** Avaddon\n\n\nSuncrypt **1%**\n\nSodinokibi **10%**\n\nRansomEXX **1%**\nRagnarok **2%**\n\nRagnar **2%**\n\nPay2Key **0%**\n\nNetWalker **10%**\n\nNefilim **1%**\n\nMountLocker **1%**\n\nMaze **2%**\n\n\n###### 1%\n\n 12%\n\n 3%\n\n 14%\n\n\nCL0P\n\nConti\n\nDarkside\n\nDoppelPaymer\n\n\nLockbit **1%**\n\n###### 38% Egregor\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 10 – Ransomware incidents by ransomware family 2020**\n\nAko/Ranzy **1%** **3%** Avaddon\n\nSuncrypt **1%** **1%** CL0P\n\nSodinokibi **9%**\n\nRansomEXX **1%** **13%** Conti\nRagnarok **1%**\n\nRagnar **2%** **4%** Darkside\n\nPysa **5%**\n\nPay2Key **1%**\n\nNetWalker **9%** **12%** DoppelPaymer\n\nNefilim **1%**\nMountLocker **1%**\nMaze **1%**\n\nLockbit **1%** **32%** Egregor\n\nEverest **1%**\n\n**Figure 11 – Ransomware incidents by sector 2020**\n\n\nUtilities **1%** **1%** Aerospace\n\nTransportation **2%** **2%** Automotive\n\nTMT **10%** **9%** Construction\n\n###### 3% Education\n 1% [Energy] 6% [Financial]\nservices\n\nRetail **17%**\n\n###### 1% Food\n\n\n###### 4%\n\n\nGovernment\n\n\nReal Estate **2%**\n\nProfessional **7%**\nservices\n\n\n###### 6% Healthcare\n\n 2% [Hospitality ]\n 3% Legal\n 1% Life Sciences\n 4% Logistics\n\n 17% [Manufacturing]\n\n\nOil & Gas\n\nNGO\n\n\n###### 2% 1%\n\n\nMining **1%**\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Case study\n\n**Multinational company compromised by ransomware attack**\n\n\nPwC’s Incident Response team responded to a\nransomware attack affecting a multinational client in\nNew Zealand. The attack saw the vast majority of its\nsystems encrypted and rendered inoperable, breaking\nits supply chain, halting global manufacturing and\ndistribution, and putting its banking covenants at risk.\nThe threat actor had been active on the victim’s\nsystems from around 11th May 2020, based on\nevidence we found of beaconing activity in firewall\nlogs, and the installation of tools such as ADFind and\nother Privilege Escalation tools. The threat actor spent\nthe next couple of weeks exploring the client’s\nnetwork and data, with file staging activities beginning\non 27th May. Exfiltration to the AnonFiles file upload\nsite started on 28th May. Our investigation revealed\nfurther installation of hacking tools on 30th May, with\nstaging activity ceasing on 31st May followed by\nfurther exfiltration of the client’s data and the\nransomware deployment on 1st June. It was at this\npoint that PwC’s investigation, containment and\nrecovery activities began.\n\n\nWorking with our global teams it was rapidly\ndetermined that the attackers were likely to be external\nRussian speaking cybercriminals motivated by\nfinancial gain. This determination was based on the\nuse of the Nefilim ransomware variant (based on\nNemty ransomware family which originated in August\n2019) and other factors. This enabled us to guide the\nclient’s response in alignment with the threat actor’s\nMO including the likely timeline and actions it would\ntake in terms of communication and posting the data\non its data dump site. The IoCs and threat intelligence\nadvisories were shared with relevant agencies and law\nenforcement. This included the threat actor’s FTP\naddress and credentials which were discovered by\nreconstructing a Windows Terminal server caching\nbitmaps. Disk and log forensic analysis, along with\nreverse engineering some of the file paths enabled us\nto locate some of the data stored on the AnonFiles site\nand reconstruct much of the staged data.\n\n\n###### Delivery mechanisms\n\nAlthough ransomware infections captured the\nheadlines within the cyber crime scene in 2020, a\npowerful ally to the threat actors were the delivery\nsystems used to drop their malicious payloads.\nMalware delivery systems are pieces of software\nspecifically designed to house malicious payloads,\nwhich are dropped by threat actors in order to gain\nan initial entry onto a target system. PwC observed\na range of delivery systems in 2020, which are\ncurrently in play by several cyber criminal\nthreat actors. These have included affiliate based\nsystems, developed to allow access to a number of\nentities, through to off-the-shelf systems, which\ncan be acquired through online private forums for a\nfee. Each played a crucial role in 2020 in aiding\ncyber criminal threat actors within their malicious\ncampaigns. The year also saw the rebirth of certain\nsystems that had been dormant for many years, as\nwell as new systems entering the market to offer a\nfresh alternative to the pre-established delivery\nsystem players.\n\n###### Emotet ups and downs\n\nAt the start of the year Emotet, which PwC tracks\nas White Taranis, continued to follow its form from\nthe end of 2019, with its consistent delivery of both\n\n\nits spam and spear phishing campaigns up to\nmid-February 2020, when White Taranis began to\ninitiate a powering down of its systems and spam\ncampaigns. These remained largely dormant until\nmid-July 2020, when a sudden burst of Emotet\nactivity once again flooded the scene.[157]\n\nSpam campaigns by Epoch 2, the threat actor’s\nprimary spam delivery botnet, were confined to the\ndelivery of new Emotet binaries, rather than\nsecondary payloads, such as TrickBot or Ursnif,\nwhich have been previously witnessed by PwC.[158]\nThis was closely followed by the threat actor’s other\nspam delivery botnet servers Epoch 1 and Epoch 3.\nThe choice to solely deliver Emotet is likely to be part\nof a replenishment scheme by the threat actor to\ndeploy the latest version of the Emotet binary on its\nstock of infected hosts, as part of a return to fullscale malware delivery operations. White Taranis has\nbeen frequently observed to take extensive ‘breaks’\nin activity throughout its years of operation, and\nthese have affected the loyalty of its client base. 2020\nwas no exception – during its break, clients of the\nEmotet delivery system were forced to make other\narrangements due to its absence. This saw the\npopularity of systems such as Qakbot and Buer\nloader increase as alternatives to Emotet.\n\n\n157 \u0007‘Emotet preparing to resume operations’, PwC Threat Intelligence UK, CTO-QRT-20200720-01A\n\n\n-----\n\nAlongside Emotet email and spear phishing\ncampaigns, PwC also observed small developments\nbeing made to the Emotet binary that was being\ndelivered during Q1 2020. This included a new\nEmotet module specifically designed to propagate\nover unsecured WiFi networks.[159] The module added\nboth scanning and brute-forcing capabilities which\nsignificantly improve Emotet’s ability to further\ncompromise hosts on an infected network.\n\n###### Qakbot still quacking\n\nThe threat actor that PwC tracks as White Horoja is\nbehind the banking trojan named Qakbot (Qbot),\nwhich in 2020 was used to deliver a range of\nransomware operations. First seen in 2007 targeting\norganisations within the finance sector, White Horoja\ntook an extended break before returning to the\nscene in 2016 with a host of new developments and\nupdates to improve both its capabilities and\noperational effectiveness.[160] In 2020, PwC witnessed\na spike in White Horoja activity resulting in an\nincrease in spam emails delivering the banking\ntrojan itself. This was further coupled with a number\nof high-profile ransomware cases that recorded the\nuse of Qakbot within their infection process.\nNoticeable ransomware operations including\nEgregor, Prolock and DoppelPaymer have all used\nQakbot as a delivery mechanism from at least Q2\n2020 onwards.[161,162] One of the reasons for this is\nlikely due to the ‘break’ Emotet took between\nFebruary and July 2020.\n\nQakbot spam campaigns employed a tried and\ntested technique, used by White Horoja, of acquiring\ncompromised WordPress websites and malicious\nWord documents to pull down and execute Qakbot.\n\n\nThis proved to be an effective method to ensure that\nan instance of Qakbot would be running on a victim\nmachine. Victims of Qakbot within 2020 covered a\nrange of sectors including education, finance,\nhealthcare, government and manufacturing across\nNorth America and Western Europe.[163] Interestingly,\none of the innovations adopted by Qakbot in 2020\nwas the introduction of a mail stealer module, which\nenabled White Horoja to distribute Qakbot via ‘reply\nto’ attacks from already infected hosts. This\ntechnique was used extensively by Emotet in 2019\nand is likely to be highly effective; recipients of emails\nare more likely to open malicious attachments and\nenable content if they have received a message from\na known contact in an existing email thread. When\nEmotet returned in July 2020, Qakbot resumed\ndelivery by Emotet itself, which led to another\neventual spike in Qakbot activity as Emotet spam\ncampaigns began to power-up.\n\nA key feature of a number of Qakbot-leveraged\nransomware attacks has been the use of an instance\nof Cobalt Strike, which employs a distinctive set of\ndomains for C2. First observed in attacks deploying\nDoppelPaymer in Q2 2020, the Cobalt Strike C2 was\nhard coded to connect to domains impersonating a\nmajor cloud service and distributed computing\nservice. Attacks delivered by Qakbot later in the year\nagain used the same naming patterns for Cobalt\nStrike C2s, but were now dropping Egregor instead\nof DoppelPaymer. It is unclear if this distinctive use\nof Cobalt Strike can be attributed to a threat actor\nwhich has had access to both DoppelPaymer and\nEgregor, or if this is a feature of White Horoja’s\nAccess-as-a-Service operation.[164]\n\n\n###### Buer Loader\n\nAlongside the activity observed by some of the major players within the delivery system scene, PwC also witnessed increased\nactivity from some of the lesser-known loaders delivering high-profile ransomware systems. Loaders such as Buer Loader,\nwhich was first introduced in August 2019, came to prominence in 2020, when it was selected to be used in a number of White\nOnibi campaigns, the threat actors behind Ryuk ransomware. Buer Loader provided an alternative option to threat actors as a\ndelivery system that harnesses the Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) model. This model allows users on the Russian-speaking\ncriminal forum Exploit.in the opportunity to purchase the loader for a base price of USD 400. Advertised as a ‘modular’ loader,\nBuer was also consistently supported throughout the year by its developers. With multiple updates and iterations released by\nthe authors, with a focus on improving its defensive evasions capabilities, in an attempt to reduce the number of antivirus\ndetections for the loader. This helped enhance the loader’s attractiveness to the delivery system market, as a reliable and\neasily accessible loader compared to its more exclusive alternatives.[165]\n\nFurthermore, with Emotet taking a brief departure during Q2 of 2020, Buer Loader popularity once again increased.\nAs it was also observed to be used by White Magician (a.k.a. TrickBot) in a number of campaigns, which further cements\nthis assessment.[166]\n\n\n159 \u0007‘Emotet wants your WiFi’, PwC Threat Intelligence UK, CTO-TIB-20200311-01A\n\n160 \u0007‘Qakbot – a dip into the pond’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20200515-02A\n\n[161 \u0007‘Whats behind the increase in ransomware attacks this year’ PwC Threat Intelligence, https://www.pwc.co.uk/issues/cyber-security-services/insights/what-is-](https://www.pwc.co.uk/issues/cyber-security-services/insights/what-is-behind-ransomware-attacks-increase.html)\n\n[behind-ransomware-attacks-increase.html](https://www.pwc.co.uk/issues/cyber-security-services/insights/what-is-behind-ransomware-attacks-increase.html)\n\n162 \u0007‘Egregor: Meet the new boss’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20201203-01A\n\n[163 \u0007NHS, ‘Qakbot Trojan’, https://digital.nhs.uk/cyber-alerts/2017/cc-1439](https://digital.nhs.uk/cyber-alerts/2017/cc-1439)\n\n164 ‘Egregor: Meet the new boss’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20201203-01A\n\n165 \u0007‘Getting loaded with Buer’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20201120-02A\n\n[166 \u0007‘Spear Phishing Campaign Delivers Buer and Bazar Malware’, zscaler, ‘https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/spear-phishing-campaign-delivers-](https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/spear-phishing-campaign-delivers-buer-and-bazar-malware)\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Bazar and TrickBot\n\nTrickBot continued to have a consistent year of\nactivity throughout 2020. At the start of the year,\nPwC observed the banking trojan making\nnumerous updates and additions to several of its\ncustom modules. These modules are designed to\nprovide TrickBot with a range of interchangeable\nfunctionalities, including the ability to scan for\nRemote Desktop Protocol (RDP) services or bypass\nUser Access Controls (UAC) on Windows\nsystems.[167] This showcased White Magician’s\ncommitment to improving and developing its\nmalware. In April 2020, this behaviour was further\nsolidified with the introduction of a new multi-stage\nmodular loader known as BazarBackdoor (a.k.a\nTeam9, BazaLoader, KEGTAP).[168] The malware itself\nshares much of its operational and technical\ncapabilities with the pre-existing TrickBot trojan,\nalso developed by White Magician.[169] However, we\nwitnessed the threat actor employing a novel\napproach to C2 infrastructure, through the use of\nthe EmerDNS service on the Emercoin\nblockchain.[170] This new TTP for White Magician\nallowed it to strengthen its C2 infrastructure and\nprevent its domains from classic takedown and\nsinkholing efforts. In September 2020, White Onibi,\nthe threat actor behind the Ryuk ransomware,\nbegan using Bazar as a delivery mechanism for its\nransomware operations, leading to a noticeable\nspike in Bazar spam and domains being created.[171]\nPwC observed the threat actor focus targeting\nlarge enterprises on a sector-agnostic basis, with\nmany of its campaign themes centred around\nenterprise and business operations.\n\n\n###### Maze: rise and fall\n\nMaze is a cyber criminal threat actor that PwC\ntracks as White Labyrinth. It is behind the Maze\nransomware operation that has been active since\nMarch 2019. Since that time, PwC has observed a\ndramatic increase in the level of activity by the\nthreat actor, especially within Q1 of 2020. This\nperiod saw the threat actor target major\norganisations and companies in what is called ‘big\ngame hunting’ in which organisations rather than\nindividual consumers are targeted in an attempt to\nreceive a greater return. These targeted\norganisations lay across a selection of sectors such\nas retail, healthcare, manufacturing and\ninsurance.[172] This included several instances of\nspecific targeting against entities related to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, including hospitals, vaccine\ntest centres and other organisations.[173]\n\nHowever, White Labyrinth’s most notable\ncontribution to 2020 was the fact that it pioneered\nthe growing trend of ransomware leak sites. It\nbecame the first known threat actor to publicly\ndisplay compromised data on a website, in an\nattempt to publicly exploit and apply pressure to\nthe victim organisation to pay the ransom demand.\nThe introduction of the Maze site sparked a\nrevolution within the ransomware scene with\nmultiple threat actors choosing to set up similar\nsites to publicly extort victims.

BEC remained prevalent across all\nindustry sectors and business sizes in 2020.\nAccording to the FBI, the increasing financial losses\nof BEC attacks amounted to USD 1.7 billion in\n2019,[175] making it the highest grossing form of\ninternet crime that year. While the majority of BEC\nattacks focus on economies of scale, seeking to\nelicit smaller amounts from targets over multiple\ncampaigns,[176] some threat actors have managed to\nsteal millions in a single attack.\n\nBEC attacks have been becoming increasingly\nsophisticated, employing a combination of tactics\nsuch as display name deception, secure server and\ndomain name impersonation, vendor email\ncompromise (VEC) and person-in-the-middle attack\n(PITM) techniques. In addition to social engineering,\nsecurity researchers have tracked the exponential\ngrowth of commodity malware (keyloggers and\nRATs) and phishing kit use among BEC actors\nbetween 2014 and 2020 attesting to the continued\ndevelopment of BEC TTPs to enhance persistence\nand scale credential stealing capabilities.[177]\n\nThe severity of BEC has prompted increased law\nenforcement responses internationally, resulting in\na number of high-profile arrests in 2020. In June\n2020, the arrests of Raymond ‘Hushpuppi’\nIgbalode[178] and Olalekan Jacob Ponle[179] (a.k.a ‘Mr.\nWoodberry’) drew mass media attention, after\ncriminal complaints against the individuals alleged\nthat their opulent lifestyles, which they flaunted\nopenly on social media to over 2.4 million followers,\nwere financed by the proceeds of online fraud.\nHushpuppi alone is alleged to have laundered\napproximately USD 138 million from BEC attacks.\n\n\nIn November 2020, in a joint operation, INTERPOL,\nGroup-IB and Nigeria Police Force arrested three\nindividuals in Lagos, Nigeria accused of engaging\nin BEC as well as developing and distributing at\nleast 26 variants of commodity malware, including\nAgentTesla, Loki, Azorult, Spartan, NanoCore and\nRemcos Remote Access Trojans.[180]\n\nPwC has reported on the activities of 11 active\nNigeria-based threat actor groups,[181] however, BEC\nis also attracting more sophisticated financially\nmotivated threat actors, such as Russia-based\nCosmic Lynx. More than 200 campaigns against\ntargets in 46 countries have been attributed to the\nRussia-based threat actor since 2019, and while on\naverage BEC attackers request approximately USD\n55,000 from each target, Cosmic Lynx requests on\naverage USD 1.27 million.[182] It is highly likely that\nBEC will continue to be a highly attractive and\nlucrative form of attack, especially in light of the\nincreased number of employees working from\nhome due to COVID-19 lockdown measures.\nRemote working has led to changes in how many\nbusinesses operate, with threat actors continuing\nto capitalise on the climate of uncertainty.\n\n\n[175 \u0007‘2019 Internet Crime Report’, FBI, https://pdf.ic3.gov/2019_IC3Report.pdf (11th February 2020)](https://pdf.ic3.gov/2019_IC3Report.pdf (11th February 2020))\n\n[176 \u0007‘BEC Wire Transfer Losses Soar 48% in Q2 2020’, Info Security Magazine, https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/bec-wire-transfer-losses/ (1st](https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/bec-wire-transfer-losses/ (1st September 2020))\n\n[September 2020)](https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/bec-wire-transfer-losses/ (1st September 2020))\n\n[177 \u0007‘SilverTerrier: 2019 Nigerian Business Email Compromise Update’, Palo Alto Unit 42, https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/silverterrier-2019-update/ (31st March](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/silverterrier-2019-update/ (31st March 2020))\n\n[2020)](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/silverterrier-2019-update/ (31st March 2020))\n\n178 \u0007‘Nigerian National Brought to U.S. to Face Charges of Conspiring to Launder Hundreds of Millions of Dollars from Cybercrime Schemes’, US Dept of Justice,\n\n[https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/pr/nigerian-national-brought-us-face-charges-conspiring-launder-hundreds-millions-dollars (3rd July 2020)](https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/pr/nigerian-national-brought-us-face-charges-conspiring-launder-hundreds-millions-dollars (3rd July 2020))\n\n179 \u0007‘Nigerian National Expelled From the United Arab Emirates to Face Cyber Fraud Charge in Chicago’, US Dept of Justice,\n\n[https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndil/pr/nigerian-national-expelled-united-arab-emirates-face-cyber-fraud-charge-chicago (3rd July 2020)](https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndil/pr/nigerian-national-expelled-united-arab-emirates-face-cyber-fraud-charge-chicago (3rd July 2020))\n\n[180 \u0007‘Three arrested as INTERPOL, Group-IB and the Nigeria Police Force disrupt prolific cybercrime group’, Interpol, https://www.interpol.int/en/News-and-Events/](https://www.interpol.int/en/News-and-Events/News/2020/Three-arrested-as-INTERPOL-Group-IB-and-the-Nigeria-Police-Force-disrupt-prolific-cybercrime-group (25th November 2020))\n\n[News/2020/Three-arrested-as-INTERPOL-Group-IB-and-the-Nigeria-Police-Force-disrupt-prolific-cybercrime-group (25th November 2020)](https://www.interpol.int/en/News-and-Events/News/2020/Three-arrested-as-INTERPOL-Group-IB-and-the-Nigeria-Police-Force-disrupt-prolific-cybercrime-group (25th November 2020))\n\n181 \u0007CTO-SIB-20200528-02A – You’ve got mail – analysis of Nigeria-based BEC threat actors\n\n[182 \u0007‘Cosmic Lynx: A Russian Threat Hits the BEC Scene’, Agari, https://www.agari.com/email-security-blog/cosmic-lynx-russian-bec/](https://www.agari.com/email-security-blog/cosmic-lynx-russian-bec/ (7th July 2020))\n\n\n-----\n\n###### The severity of BEC has prompted increased law enforcement responses internationally, resulting in a number of\n high-profile arrests in 2020.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Case study\n\n**Norfund defrauded of NOK 100 million in Business Email Compromise[183]**\n\n\nOn 16th March 2020, Norfund transferred USD\n9,888,055 to a bank account in Banco Mercantil del\nNorte, Mexico, which Norfund believed belonged to\nits client, the Cambodian financial institution LOLC\nPlc.

Publicly available research had noted that the\nthreat actor operating Emotet was using open-source webshells\n– mostly with the same password – to control its botnet’s\ncompromised infrastructure and temporarily host payloads. The\nvigilante entity was able to gain access to the webshells across\na portion of the Emotet botnet’s infrastructure, and moved to\nreplace malicious payloads and controller scripts hosted on it\nwith animated GIFs.\n\nThe series of defacements reportedly slowed down Emotet\n\n\nAs ransomware activity continues to grow, the US\nDepartment of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets\nControl’s (OFAC) warning against ransom payment\nmay serve to generate change. In October 2020,\nOFAC warned US organisations of potential\nsanction risks for facilitating ransom payments to\nthreat actors. It warned that organisations involved\nin the facilitation chain, such as financial institutions\nand insurance providers, may also be liable for\nbreaching sanctions.[196]\n\nWhilst threat actors will ultimately continue to\nconduct their operations, it is clear that the\ntakedown of key threat actor infrastructure can\ncause significant disruption to their operations. The\nrelease of a threat actor’s toolset may also trigger a\nperiod of adjustment as they retool to avoid\ndetection, although we note that some threat\nactors, such as those based in North Korea and\nIran have been seemingly unphased by similar\naction in the past.\n\n\nThe series of defacements reportedly slowed down Emotet\noperations temporarily, when the amount of hijacked\ninfrastructure reached about a quarter of its total payload\ndownloads.[197]\n\n\nThe effectiveness of indictments and sanctions on\ndeterring cyber operations is more difficult to\ndetermine. Indictments against individual\noperators, for example, are unlikely to result in\nextradition, particularly where the activity is tasked\nby the state. The effect of sanctions on ransom\npayments however, may push cyber criminals to\nreassess their methods going forwards if it\nbecomes unviable to meet payments.

UNC2452), trojanised updates to SolarWind’s\nOrion IT monitoring and management software,\nmodifying the ‘SolarWinds.Orion.Core.\nBusinessLayer.dll’ component, to contain a\nbackdoor known as SUNBURST (a.k.a. Solorigate).\nMultiple iterations of the Orion software were\naffected from at least software version 2019.4 HF 5\nto 2020.2.1 HF 1, released between March 2020\nand June 2020.[200]\n\n\nOur analysis, as well as multiple open source reports,\nhighlighted that the threat actor invested significant\neffort in embedding SUNBURST into a legitimate\nSolarWinds Orion DLL: creating a file which contains\nboth the SUNBURST payload and legitimate code\nused in SolarWinds functionality, all signed by a\nlegitimate SolarWinds private key, across multiple\nupdates. The threat actor also took a number of\nsteps to blend in with legitimate activity and traffic of\nthe infected system and make analysis and detection\nmore difficult.[201] In addition to masquerading HTTP\nrequests as legitimate Orion traffic or as benign XML,\nand to using a custom JSON structure to\ncommunicate with the C2, SUNBURST applied\nexecution delay, victim machine domain checking,\nscreening running processes and services against a\nblocklist in an effort to avoid detection, command\nand control IP checking, stopping antivirus and EDR\nservices, as well as other execution safeguards and\nanti-analysis features.\n\n\n[198 \u0007‘Highly Evasive Attacker Leverages SolarWinds Supply Chain to Compromise Multiple Global Victims With SUNBURST Backdoor’, FireEye, https://www.fireeye.](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-withsunburst-backdoor.html)\n\n[com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-withsunburst-backdoor.html (13th December 2020)](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-withsunburst-backdoor.html)\n\n[199 \u0007‘Customer Guidance on Recent Nation-State Cyber Attacks’, Microsoft, https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2020/12/13/customer-guidanceon-recent-nation-state-](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2020/12/13/customer-guidanceon-recent-nation-state-cyber-attacks/)\n\n[cyber-attacks/ (13th December 2020)](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2020/12/13/customer-guidanceon-recent-nation-state-cyber-attacks/)\n\n[200 \u0007Active Exploitation of SolarWinds Software, CISA, https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/current-activity/2020/12/13/active-exploitation-solarwindssoftware (13th](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/current-activity/2020/12/13/active-exploitation-solarwindssoftware)\n\nDecember 2020)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware has a wide range of capabilities.\nA notable feature is the way it generates a unique set\nof subdomains for the infected machine to connect to\nfor command and control. Part of the logic of the\ncustom domain generation algorithm (DGA)[202] is used\ninitially to identify victim machines of interest to the\nattacker. Specifically, SUNBURST determines the\nFully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) to which the\nvictim machine is registered, and uses this in the DGA\nfor subdomain generation, along with an eight byte\nunique victim ID. If the FQDN domain record is empty\nor null, the malware will exit, likely in an effort to avoid\nexecuting on machines which are not part of an\nintended target network.\n\nOverall, the threat actor that developed SUNBURST\ndisplayed a high level of technical sophistication,\nhaving gone to great lengths to develop a stealthy\nmalware family able to clearly profile victims, and\ndeliver further payloads or exfiltrate information\nfrom targets. Other than the notable scale of the\nincident, and it remaining under the radar for\nmonths, it is also worth pointing out that the\nSolarWinds compromise was likely only one of\nmultiple methods used by the same threat actor to\ngain access to targets.[203]\n\n\nAs the investigation into the SolarWinds\ncompromise continues, a follow-up report by\nMicrosoft also detailed the discovery of a separate,\ndifferent malware family from SUNBURST: a .NET\nwebshell that is known in open source as\nSUPERNOVA.[204] SUPERNOVA is designed to take a\nvalid .NET program as a parameter, and compile\nand execute it in memory (leaving no forensic\ntraces on disk).[205] While SUPERNOVA was also\ndelivered in the form of a maliciously altered\nSolarWinds Orion component, it was not delivered\nvia the same vector as SUNBURST, and it has been\nassociated with a different threat actor from the\none deploying SUNBURST, adding further\ncomplexity to the timelining, scope, and\nconsequences of the compromise as well as to its\nattribution.

In July 2020, we observed a sample of\nan Able downloader bundled with a first stage loader\nfor the HyperBro backdoor.\n\n\nIn December 2020, Avast reported on Red Phoenix\n(a.k.a. APT27, Emissary Panda) activity targeting the\nMongolian public sector, including by compromising\na company providing services to the Mongolian\ngovernment, and deploying HyperBro.[206] An ESET\nreport also made a link between HyperBro and\ntargeting of Mongolia.[207] Based on ESET’s analysis,\nbetween at least 2018 and 2020, both trojanised Able\nDesktop installers and compromised Able Desktop\nupdates were used by threat actors to deliver multiple\ndifferent malware families to targets. These included:\n\n\n###### 1 HyperBro, as observed by both PwC and Avast;\n\n 2 PlugX, a backdoor shared between multiple China-based threat actors; and,\n\n**TManger, a backdoor recently detailed in a series of posts by NTTSecurity[208] and attributed**\n###### 3 to Red Orthrus (a.k.a. Keyboy).\n\nAt the moment, it is unclear whether the same threat actor abused the Able compromise to deliver both\nHyperBro, PlugX, and TManger; whether Red Phoenix and Red Orthrus shared access to the victim; or,\nwhether Red Phoenix and Red Orthrus separately compromised Able and abused their access to\ntarget Mongolia.\n\n\n###### VeraPort\n\nIn November 2020, ESET also reported that Black\nArtemis was conducting a supply chain compromise\ncampaign abusing WIZVERA VeraPort software.[209]\nVeraPort is used to manage software integration\ninstallation, and is necessary in order to access some\nSouth Korean government websites. Upon visiting\nwebsites or applications also running VeraPort,\nVeraPort users automatically receive and install any\ncomponent that may be required by such sites.\n\nThe threat actor reportedly compromised\nindividual legitimate websites supporting VeraPort,\naltering the hosted VeraPort software package to\ninclude malware.\n\n\nThereafter, VeraPort users visiting the\ncompromised websites would receive malware\nsimilar to that described by KR-CERT in Operation\nBookCode reports.[210]\n\nBlack Artemis also used stolen valid digital\ncertificates to sign the malicious binaries delivered to\nvictims, in order to bypass VeraPort’s default-enabled\nexecution safeguards, as the software would only\nallow the installation of binaries signed with valid\ncertificates but not verify who the certificates had\nbeen issued to.

The client had been\ndevastated by ransomware, which had affected\nmost of its critical IT systems. The threat actor that\nlaunched the attack made efforts to delete backups\nas well as log data. This made it challenging to\npursue its activities. Shortly after the breach, the\nthreat actor demanded USD 210,000 in exchange\nfor decryption software. The victim did not pay\nthe ransom.\n\nThe investigation concluded that the threat actor\nhad highly likely leveraged a Citrix NetScaler\nappliance vulnerable to CVE-2019-19781 as its\nentry point, deploying Cobalt Strike as its\ncommand-and-control tool, before deploying the\nransomware family Defray777 (also known as\nRansomEXX, 777 and Target777). While PwC was\nunable to attribute the ransomware incident to a\nknown threat actor, our investigation uncovered\nevidence that the same appliance highly likely had\nbeen compromised by two other threat actors prior\nto the ransomware incident.\n\n\nThe China-based threat actor Red Kelpie had\ndeployed a custom proprietary backdoor identified\nas SPECULOOS. The command-and-control\nportion of this implant abused functionality in the\nTLS 1.0 Client Hello handshake packet, making it\nappear to be requesting a legitimate Microsoft\nservice in the Server Name Indication (SNI) field,\nwhile in reality reaching out to a non-associated IP\naddress. At the time, the technique was novel, and\nsuggests that the threat actor made significant\nefforts to make the handshake look innocuous.\n\nPrior to this intrusion, the Iran-based threat actor\nYellow Dev 15 deployed a webshell framework on\nthe same appliance. Yellow Dev 15 is reportedly\nknown to sell access post-compromise to cyber\ncriminals, after its own actions and objectives are\nachieved, which often align with Iran’s strategic\nobjectives. However, the FBI assesses the threat\nactor has both capability and intent to deploy\nransomware. The intrusion remains an interesting\nexample of how organisations developing dual-use\ntechnologies can find themselves in the crosshairs\nof multiple resourceful threat actors.\n\n\n###### Remote working: victims\n and threat actors\n\nVirtual Private Network (VPN) software, enterprise\nremote access and virtualisation software have\ndoubtlessly been fundamental in the shift to flexible or\nfully-remote work following the COVID-19 outbreak.\nWhile they have long been a key target for threat\nactors determined to gain access to victim networks,\nVPNs and remote access products have really come\nin the crosshairs of attackers in 2020, being exploited\nboth in espionage motivated and financially motivated\n\n\nintrusions. This is also partly due to several critical\nvulnerabilities being uncovered in enterprise software\nin 2020[212,213,214,215 ]and several critical ones from both\n2019 and 2018 remaining unpatched.[216,217,218,219]\n\nActual vulnerabilities in software have combined with\never-continuing phishing activity, and with the human\nfactor – more relevant than ever in 2020, with often\nmore isolated and fatigued personnel – into a highly\nexposed attack surface, especially when it comes to\nremote authentication and access.\n\n\n212 ‘CVE-2020-5902’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-QRT-20200706-01A\n\n213 \u0007‘2020-10 Security Bulletin: Junos OS: Buffer overflow vulnerability in device control daemon (CVE-2020-1664)’, Juniper, https://kb.juniper.net/InfoCenter/\n\nindex?page=content&id=JSA11061&actp=METADATA (29th October 2020)\n\n214 \u0007‘SonicWall VPN Portal Critical Flaw (CVE-2020-5135)’, TripWire, https://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/vert/sonicwall-vpn-portal-critical-flaw\ncve-2020-5135/ (14th October 2020)\n\n215 \u0007‘Alert: Multiple actors are attempting to exploit MobileIron vulnerability CVE 2020-15505’, UK NCSC, https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/alert-multiple-actors\nattempt-exploit-mobileiron-vulnerability (23rd October 2020)\n\n216 \u0007‘CVE-2019-19781 – Vulnerability in Citrix Application Delivery Controller, Citrix Gateway, and Citrix SD-WAN WANOP appliance’, Citrix, https://support.citrix.\n\ncom/article/CTX267027 (23rd October 2020)\n\n217 \u0007‘SA44101 – 2019-04: Out-of-Cycle Advisory: Multiple vulnerabilities resolved in Pulse Connect Secure/Pulse Policy Secure 9.0RX’, Pulse Secure, https://\n\nkb.pulsesecure.net/articles/Pulse_Security_Advisories/SA44101\n\n218 \u0007‘Alert (AA20-258A) Chinese Ministry of State Security-Affiliated Cyber Threat Actor Activity’, US CISA, https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-258a (24th\n\nOctober 2020)\n\n219 \u0007‘Alert (AA20-283A) APT Actors Chaining Vulnerabilities Against SLTT, Critical Infrastructure, and Elections Organizations’, US CISA, https://us-cert.cisa.gov/\n\n\n-----\n\nThreat actors will inevitably capitalise on the\nsituation to conduct their attacks. In some cases,\nwe have seen multiple threat actors exploiting the\nsame known vulnerability to gain access to an\norganisation’s estate.\n\nMultiple threat actors, such as Red Kelpie, have\ncontinued to exploit existing vulnerabilities in VPNs as\nwell as other remote access and enterprise\nsoftware,[220] such as PulseSecure and Citrix, while\nalso working to include newly disclosed ones, for\nexample CVE-2020-10189 (a Remote Code Execution\nvulnerability in ManageEngine Desktop Central).[221,222]\nUS CERT also reported that in some cases, Red\nKelpie deployed the legitimate VPN software\nSoftEther to facilitate follow-on access to victim\nnetworks. Multiple other China-based threat actors\nhave also been targeting VPN vulnerabilities, as\ndetailed in a US National Security Agency (NSA)\nadvisory released in October 2020.[223]\n\nPwC also analysed some of Yellow Nix’s attack\nsequences, noting the threat actor’s agility in rapidly\nmoving to exploit newly-released vulnerabilities.[224]\nAbout one week after a public proof of concept\nexploit for the vulnerability was released, for example,\nMicrosoft Security Intelligence reported that Yellow\nNix had started exploiting Zerologon (CVE-20201472).[225] In some cases, Yellow Nix also exploited\nCVE-2020-0688, a remote code execution\nvulnerability affecting Microsoft Exchange mail server\nsoftware, as well as known Outlook Web Access\n(OWA) vulnerabilities.[226] US CERT also issued an\nalert, in September 2020, about the ongoing\nexploitation of VPN vulnerabilities by the Iran-based\nthreat actor Yellow Dev 15.[227] We have investigated\nseveral incidents involving this dual motivated threat\nactor, whose exploitation of network appliances is a\ntechnique which distinguishes it from other Iranbased sets.\n\n\nFinally, an NCSC advisory detailed Blue Kitsune’s\nexploitation of Sangfor VPN software.[228] After\ncompromising Sangfor VPN servers, Blue Kitsune\nwas able to deliver the SOREFANG[229] victim profiler\nand downloader to victims in place of the legitimate\nSangfor update, abusing the fact that the VPN\nclients did not verify the integrity of the updates. In\nlate October 2020, US CISA also reported that\nanother Russia-based threat actor, that PwC tracks\nas Blue Kraken (a.k.a. Dragonfly, Havex), was also\nabusing Cisco AnyConnect SSL VPN connections\nfor remote logins on victim networks along with\nother mailing software vulnerabilities such as in\nMicrosoft Exchange Server (CVE-2020-0688).[230]\n\nHowever, it is important to note that financiallymotivated cyber criminal threat actors, too, have been\ntargeting enterprises via VPN software and remote\nconnections, in addition to the spam operations we\ndetailed earlier in this report. While unsecured RDP\nhas consistently been an initial access vector in\nintrusions, including ones ultimately deploying\nransomware, ransomware affiliates have also been\ntargeting VPN software as an entry point into\nnetworks. Public reports have indicated that a\nvulnerability in the Citrix Application Delivery\nController (CVE-2019-19781) was the entry point in\nintrusions leading to ransomware infections with\nSodinokibi, DoppelPaymer, CL0P or Nefilim, while\nSodinokibi and Ryuk also used a vulnerability in Pulse\nConnect Secure (CVE-2019-11510).\n\nVPN software is implemented by enterprises in order to\nguarantee secure remote access, but it can turn into a\ndirect entry point into victim networks if valid VPN\ncredentials are compromised or if the software is not\nadequately patched. This is the case both for recently\ndisclosed, as well as previously known vulnerabilities,\nas public bodies, as well as private security\ncompanies, have pointed out in multiple advisories in\nthe past year. Ultimately, this kind of exploitation is\nhighly likely to persist – and to lead to both espionagemotivated as well as financially-motivated compromise\n– so long as systems remain unpatched.\n\n\n[220 \u0007‘This Is Not a Test: APT41 Initiates Global Intrusion Campaign Using Multiple Exploits’, FireEye: Christopher Glyer, Dan Perez, Sarah Jones, Steve Miller, https://](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/03/apt41-initiates-global-intrusion-campaign-using)\n\n[www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/03/apt41-initiates-global-intrusion-campaign-using-multiple-exploits.html, (25th March 2020)](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/03/apt41-initiates-global-intrusion-campaign-using)\n\n221 ‘AC-000133-TT – Indictment of China-based Cyber Actors Associated with APT 41 for Intrusion Activities’, FBI, 16th September 2020\n\n222 ‘A counterstrike on the money’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-SIB-20200930-01A\n\n223 \u0007‘Chinese State-Sponsored Actors Exploit Publicly Known Vulnerabilities’, US National Security Agency, https://media.defense.gov/2020/Oct/20/2002519884/\n1/-1/0/CSA_CHINESE_EXPLOIT_VULNERABILITIES_UOO179811.PDF (20th October 2020)\n\n224 \u0007‘Seedworm sees a CVE’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20201020-01A\n\n225 \u0007@MsftSecIntel, Twitter, https://twitter.com/MsftSecIntel/status/1313246337153077250 (5th October 2020)\n\n226 ‘Operation Quicksand’, ClearSky, October 2020, https://www.clearskysec.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Operation-Quicksand.pdf\n\n227 \u0007‘Alert (AA20-259A) – Iran-Based Threat Actor Exploits VPN Vulnerabilities’, US CISA, https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-259a (15th September 2020)\n\n228 \u0007‘Advisory: APT29 targets COVID-19 vaccine development’, UK National Cyber Security Centre, https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/files/Advisory-APT29-targets-COVID\n19-vaccine-development.pdf (16th July 2020)\n\n229 ‘MAR-10296782-1.v1 – SOREFANG’, US CISA, https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/ar20-198a (16th July 2020)\n\n230 \u0007‘Alert (AA20-296A) – Russian State-Sponsored Advanced Persistent Threat Actor Compromises U.S. Government Targets’, US CISA, https://us-cert.cisa.gov/\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Social engineering\n\nSocial engineering involves either the convincing or coercing of targets to gain their trust and ultimately carry\nout a specific action. More often than not, this technique is essential to the effective execution of the threat\nactor’s attack process. Whilst social engineering is by no means a new technique, 2020 saw threat actors\nperfecting their techniques and becoming more bold in engaging with their targets. Social media platforms are\nnow not only used for reconnaissance but also increasingly leveraged to interact with targets across multiple\nservices, a move which reflects the changing methods by which people interact today.\n\n\nAs part of its ShowState\ncampaign, Black Artemis used\nLinkedIn to perform both\nreconnaissance and create fake\nprofiles to masquerade as a HR\nrecruiter, building trust with the\nvictim, sometimes over weeks or\nmonths of interaction. Once this\nhad been established, the\ncommunication reportedly\ntransferred alternate means of\ncontact including WhatsApp,\nemail, and even phone calls,\nbefore delivering malware.\n\n\nYellow Garuda has utilised social\nengineering techniques to great\neffect over a number of years. In\na campaign uncovered in August\n2020,[231] the threat actor used a\nfake journalist persona to\nconverse with targets over\nmultiple mediums including\nemail, WhatsApp and LinkedIn. It\neven reportedly used WhatsApp\nto initiate voice calls with its\ntargets, a technique we have not\nseen the threat actor use before.\n\n\n###### Case study\n\n**Multiple threat actors target an organisation in the transport sector**\n\n\nIn September 2020, PwC’s Incident Response team\nresponded to an incident affecting an organisation in\nthe transport sector. The client had been notified by\nlocal law enforcement that its external facing Citrix\nNetScaler devices may have been compromised by\nan Iran-based threat actor. Following our\ninvestigation, it was found that an unpatched\nvulnerability in Citrix NetScaler systems\n(CVE-2019-19781) was likely exploited multiple times\nby unrelated threat actors between January and\nSeptember 2020.\n\nThis is the same vulnerability that was exploited in the\ncompromise of the maritime technology company\ndiscussed in an earlier case study. Although an\nentirely separate incident, there were overlaps in the\nthreat actors exploiting the vulnerability and the\ntechniques they were observed to use.\n\nThe first known exploitation occurred in January\n2020, where an unknown threat actor gained access\nto an internet facing NetScaler device in activity\nconsistent with the general scanning and exploitation\nof the Citrix vulnerability. There was no evidence of\nany further malicious activity from this threat actor.\n\n\nIn February 2020, following a successful\nexploitation of the vulnerability, a custom backdoor\nknown as SPECULOOS was placed on a second\nNetScaler device, likely allowing for remote access to\nthe system.\n\nLater that same month, a different version of the\nsame backdoor was placed on the first NetScaler\ndevice. Based on the timing of the activity and known\nTTPs, this activity was likely related to Red Kelpie,\nwhich has been previously seen to target this\nvulnerability across multiple sectors.\n\nThreat actor activity attributed to Yellow Dev 15 was\nobserved between July and September 2020. In July\n2020, it placed a web-based backdoor (webshell) on\nboth NetScaler devices following successful\nexploitation of the Citrix vulnerability, allowing it to\nremotely execute commands. The threat actor was\nable to exploit an unsecure LDAP connection to\nharvest credentials, gaining access to Domain\nAdministrator level privileges. It was able to move\nlaterally and performed internal reconnaissance\nleveraging native Windows tools including PsExec\nand the Director Service Internals suite, which it\ninstalled using PowerShell and used to extract\ncredentials from the Active Directory.\n\n\n231 \u0007‘The Kittens Are Back in Town 3: Charming Kitten Campaign Evolved and Deploying Spear-Phishing link by WhatsApp’, ClearSky,\n\n\n-----\n\n###### MITRE ATT&CK techniques\n\nThe MITRE ATT&CK matrices[232] provide a model to describe a threat actor’s tactics and techniques\nacross different environments. The following table highlights the most common techniques we saw\nbeing used in 2020.\n\n###### Tactic Technique\n\n**Initial** **T1566 – Phishing**\n**Access**\n\nPhishing, whether through an attachment, link or via a service, remains one of the most\ncommon initial attack vectors utilised by threat actors. Timely lures concerning real-world\nevents are often effective in piquing the interest of the target. In 2020, the onset of\nCOVID-19 allowed many threat actors to readily take advantage of the uncertainty\nsurrounding the pandemic, and PwC saw multiple threat actors utilising it as a theme.\n\n###### T1133 – External Remote Services\n\nThreat actors have continued to be adept at making use of disclosed vulnerabilities and\nincorporating new techniques into their arsenal. The compromise of remote services has\ncome under greater focus in 2020 due to the increased reliance many organisations now\nhave on them. Red Kelpie, for example, has utilised the vulnerabilities within these\nExternal Remote Services as a means to both gain and maintain initial access to its\ntarget’s networks, as well as deliver its final payloads to victim machines.[233]\n\n###### T1195 – Supply Chain Compromise\n\nThe targeting of entities within the supply chain has become a way for threat actors to gain\naccess to one or many targets exploiting a trusted relationship. 2020 saw a global supply\nchain compromise which exploited a vulnerability in the SolarWinds Orion business\nsoftware to deliver a previously undocumented backdoor known as SUNBURST. [234]\n\n**Execution** **T1204 – User Execution**\n\nUser execution is a technique utilised in almost every campaign, with threat actors\ncoercing the victim in one way or another to play a part in the attack process. Most\ncommonly, in activating malware by getting the user to execute a malicious file or\nenable macros on their system. For example, Yellow Nix often uses a macro delivery\nsystem with a generic lure asking the user to enable macros to view the file contents.\nThis action however, enables malicious code to run in the background.[235, 236]\n\n###### T1059 – Command and Scripting Interpreter\n\nThe use of common interfaces and scripting languages provides threat actors with a\nmeans of ensuring their malware executes successfully on different environments. On\nWindows operating systems, the use of PowerShell commands is particularly popular. For\nexample, Blue Python has used PowerShell in a number of campaigns, both as a method\nof compiling and injecting its later stage payloads onto disk; such as ComRAT,[237] as well\nas being used for executing commands on the victim’s system.[238]\n\n232 MITRE ATT&CK, ‘Enterprise Matrix’, https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/\n\n233 \u0007‘This Is Not a Test: APT41 Initiates Global Intrusion Campaign Using Multiple Exploits’, FireEye, https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/03/apt41\ninitiates-global-intrusion-campaign-using-multiple-exploits.html (25th March 2020)\n\n234 ‘White Dev 61 SUNBURST’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20201217-01A\n\n235 ‘More Tricks from Yellow Nix’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20200113-01A\n\n236 ‘Interstellar operational security’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20200206-01A\n\n237 ‘Blue Pythons PowerShell Swarm Part 1’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20200928-01A\n\n|Tactic|Technique|\n|---|---|\n|Initial Access|T1566 – Phishing Phishing, whether through an attachment, link or via a service, remains one of the most common initial attack vectors utilised by threat actors. Timely lures concerning real-world events are often effective in piquing the interest of the target. In 2020, the onset of COVID-19 allowed many threat actors to readily take advantage of the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic, and PwC saw multiple threat actors utilising it as a theme. T1133 – External Remote Services Threat actors have continued to be adept at making use of disclosed vulnerabilities and incorporating new techniques into their arsenal.

Red Kelpie, for example, has utilised the vulnerabilities within these External Remote Services as a means to both gain and maintain initial access to its target’s networks, as well as deliver its final payloads to victim machines.233 T1195 – Supply Chain Compromise The targeting of entities within the supply chain has become a way for threat actors to gain access to one or many targets exploiting a trusted relationship. 2020 saw a global supply chain compromise which exploited a vulnerability in the SolarWinds Orion business software to deliver a previously undocumented backdoor known as SUNBURST. 234|\n|Execution|T1204 – User Execution User execution is a technique utilised in almost every campaign, with threat actors coercing the victim in one way or another to play a part in the attack process. Most commonly, in activating malware by getting the user to execute a malicious file or enable macros on their system. For example, Yellow Nix often uses a macro delivery system with a generic lure asking the user to enable macros to view the file contents. This action however, enables malicious code to run in the background.235, 236 T1059 – Command and Scripting Interpreter The use of common interfaces and scripting languages provides threat actors with a means of ensuring their malware executes successfully on different environments. On Windows operating systems, the use of PowerShell commands is particularly popular. For example, Blue Python has used PowerShell in a number of campaigns, both as a method of compiling and injecting its later stage payloads onto disk; such as ComRAT,237 as well as being used for executing commands on the victim’s system.238|\n\n\n-----\n\n|Tactic|Technique|\n|---|---|\n|Persistence|T1547.001 – Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: Registry Run Keys/Startup Folder There are a number of techniques threat actors can use to maintain persistence, but the most common we see are the use of run registry keys or other startup mechanisms that mean the malicious payload will survive a system reboot. Such examples include variants of Red Phoenix’s HyperBro backdoor, which not only has the option to append the malware to the Run registry key if certain conditions are met, but has multiple other means to achieve the end goal of persistence.239|\n|Privilege Escalation|T1068 – Exploitation for Privilege Escalation One means of privilege escalation is through the exploitation of either a known or unknown (zero day) software vulnerability. Yellow Nix exploited CVE-2020-1472 – known as Zerologon – which concerns the Netlogon Remote Protocol (MS-NRPC). Using this exploit, Yellow Nix was able to escalate its privileges to that of a domain administrator.240|\n|Defence Evasion|T1027 – Obfuscated Files or Information Many threat actors will attempt to disguise their malware or communication through obfuscation, making it more difficult to identify and potentially analyse. This technique is used by most threat actors, although 2020 has seen some novel uses of it, such as Blue Python’s updated .NET obfuscator for their Kazuar malware. This used a large switch statement within the binary in order to make particular character substitutions.241 T1140 – Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information Complementary to T1027, obfuscated data will often need to be deobfuscated or decoded prior to use. One example of this is in the use of the 8.t framework, which several China-based threat actors continue to use. This is an RTF weaponiser technique that uses OLE objects and a number of equation editor vulnerabilities in order to decode and execute shellcode into a final malicious payload.242, 243, 244 T1036 – Masquerading Masquerading is a common technique used by many threat actors as a means of blending into a victim’s environment. In many cases, relatively simple techniques are being used to effect. For example, we have seen Black Artemis mimicking antivirus vendors in its filenames to disguise its BEEFEATER malware.245 Similarly, the use of icons from legitimate applications is another common way of tricking victims into believing they are opening a legitimate application. As part of an extensive campaign targeting users in China, Orange Athos disguised malicious binaries using Microsoft Word, and icons mimicking Tencent Cloud services and the Qihoo360 company logo.246|\n\n\n239 ‘A history of HyperBro’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20200324-01A\n\n240 ‘Seedworm sees a CVE’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20201020-01A\n\n241 ‘Kazuars cryptic strings’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20200504-01A\n\n242 ‘Exploited to a 8T’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20200122-01A\n\n243 ‘From Moscow to Mongolia with Bisonal and 8.t’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20200327-01A\n\n244 ‘wll wll wll look what we have here’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20200529-01A\n\n245 \u0007‘Artemis, Banshee and Shoggoth walk into a bar:North Korea-based threat actors activity report’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20200630-02A\n\n\n-----\n\n|Tactic|Technique|\n|---|---|\n|Defence Evasion|T1070.004 – Indicator Removal on Host: File Deletion The deletion of files on the victim’s system, whilst noisy, can prevent the victim from being able to see the full chain of execution and removes indicators of compromise from the victim’s machine. As such, it is a common technique used by multiple threat actors. For example, we have seen several Poison Ivy campaigns that use specific ‘Loader’ executables that initially load the Poison Ivy payload, and then subsequently delete itself and all trace of any initialisation.247 T1221 – Template Injection Template injection is a way for threat actors to conceal their malicious code within Office templates, usually through Office Open XML (OOXML) specifications. The malicious code can subsequently be used to fetch and execute remote document templates. One of the key exploiters of this technique in 2020 has been Blue Otso (a.k.a. Gamaredon Group), which has conducted multiple campaigns using DOCX files that use Office vulnerabilities in order to download and open a malicious template document that contains malicious embedded macros.248|\n|Credential Access|T1056.001 – Keylogging Keylogging is a technique that allows the threat actor to record the keystrokes of the victim as they interact with their keyboard. For example, North Korea-based threat actor Black Artemis (a.k.a. Lazarus Group) added an additional module to its already established Dtrack malware to give it keylogging functionality.249 T1187 – Forced Authentication This technique exploits baked-in protocols in Windows architecture. The threat actor will usually take advantage of several authentication protocols in Windows networks such as Server Message Block (SMB) and Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV), forcing the victim to provide authentication information which the threat actor can intercept. We have observed this behaviour in 2020 being used by Blue Kraken to exploit the SMB protocol, and inject code to grab the NTLM hashes of victims across multiple sectors, but mainly focusing on the aviation sector in the United States.250|\n|Discovery|T1083 – File and Directory Discovery In 2020, this technique has been consistently used by cyber crime groups, such as White Mjolnir (a.k.a. Ragnar Locker)251 and Blue Lelantos (a.k.a. Dridex),252 to enumerate and map their victim’s drives before extracting sensitive information. The information collected is used to coerce the target into paying the ransomware that is subsequently detonated on the target’s system, or it is sold on leak sites – a new, insidious theme across cyber crime in 2020. T1082 – System Information Discovery Threat actors often seek detailed information about the victim’s operating system and hardware such as system architecture, domain information and user data which the threat actor can potentially later exploit. This technique has been used by multiple threat actors, including Iran-based threat actor Yellow Liderc (a.k.a Tortoiseshell), which was observed in 2020 utilising scripts to enumerate system information and send it back to the threat actor.|\n\n\n247 ‘You just got LBTServed’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20201209-01A\n\n248 ‘Blue Otso super spreader’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20200406-01A\n\n249 ‘Dtrack Side B’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20200130-01A\n\n250 ‘Dissecting Blue Krakens Visits’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20201106-03A\n\n251 ‘Ragnar Locker Ransomware’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20201207-01A\n\n2 2\n\n\n-----\n\n|Tactic|Technique|\n|---|---|\n|Discovery|T1057 – Process Discovery Understanding which processes are running on the target’s machine can be used to determine a malware’s next steps, such as terminating specific processes that are detrimental to its functionality, or terminating itself from the victim’s system. For example, White Mjolnir’s strain of ransomware (a.k.a. Ragnar Locker) that will search for and terminate specific processes running on the victim’s machine that it deems crucial to its operation.253|\n|Collection|T1005 – Data from Local System The local system of a victim’s machine provides large amounts of information that is useful to threat actors, such as file systems and local databases. We have observed Grey Karkadann (a.k.a. APT-C-23, Desert Falcons) incorporating a number of functions into its Pierogi malware which allow it to access data from the local system. For example, creating file listings of the user directory, finding and exfiltrating files of a specified file type and last modified date, and obtaining login data from specific browsers.254|\n|Command and Control|T1071 – Application Layer Protocol One of the most popular ways of blending in with legitimate network traffic is to communicate to the command and control (C2) server using application layer protocols. There are multiple examples of this technique being used by threat actors, such as the OceanMap256 and OceanDrive257 malware families that utilise either IMAP or Google Drive storage for C2 communications, or Red Keres (a.k.a. APT31) utilising Dropbox for its malware’s C2.258|\n|Exfiltration|T1041 – Exfiltration Over C2 Channel The exfiltration of sensitive data is often the end goal of intelligence gathering activities and using the existing C2 channel is a common means of doing so. 2020 has notably seen this technique being adopted by the operators behind ransomware as they increasingly look to incorporate data exfiltration as part of their attack process. Whilst the encryption of data is still a key component of their operations, the widespread use of leak sites has seen groups such as White Ursia (a.k.a. Sodinokibi), White Mjolnir (a.k.a. Ragnar Locker), and White Onibi (a.k.a. Ryuk) all adopt the model of exfiltrating data over a C2, whilst also detonating their ransomware on their way out. 259,260,261|\n\n\n253 ‘RagnarLocker Ransomware’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20201207-01A\n\n254 ‘A new and improved recipe for Pierogi’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20201106-02A\n\n255 \u0007Microsoft, ‘Trojan:MSIL/OceanMap.A!dha’, https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/threats/malware-encyclopedia-description?Name=Trojan:MSIL/\n\nOceanMap.A!dha&ThreatID=2147767197\n\n256 \u0007Microsoft, ‘Trojan:MSIL/OceanDrive.A!dha’, https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/threats/malware-encyclopedia-description?Name=Trojan:MSIL/\n\nOceanDrive.A!dha&ThreatID=2147767195\n\n257 ‘Oceans 58’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20201118-03A\n\n258 ‘Red Keres’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-SIB-20200702-01A\n\n259 ‘Sodinokibi – The Beast Grows’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20201008-01A\n\n260 ‘RagnarLocker Ransomware’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20201207-01A\n\n\n-----\n\n|Tactic|Technique|\n|---|---|\n|Impact|T1486 – Data Encrypted for Impact The encryption of data is a technique notorious to cyber criminal groups, which have become increasingly more active and brazen in their targeting. Ransomware is used to encrypt a victim’s system, often only after extracting sensitive information from those directories. These sorts of attacks are more common than they have ever been, with 2020 seeing groups such as White Onibi (a.k.a. Ryuk), White Magician (a.k.a. TrickBot), and White Horoja (a.k.a. Qakbot) having an extremely active year. T1490 – Inhibit System Recovery Preventing a victim from recovering their system is a common technique used by cyber criminal groups, as a means of making sure the victim’s system remains permanently damaged should they not meet the demands of the attacker. This technique is found in a variety of ransomware families such as White Helios’ ransomware (a.k.a. Suncrypt) that will delete the victim’s shadow volume copy.262 T1489 – Service Stop Threat actors often attempt to disable services on a victim’s system to either cause further damage to an environment, or prevent the victim being alerted to malicious activity. For example, Black Shoggoth (a.k.a. Reaper) reconfigured a new ComSysApp service for its own malicious purposes by first deleting the legitimate one.263 Virtually all ransomware variants kill active processes that prevent them from accessing files targeted for encryption. EKANS (a.k.a White Morok) ransomware takes this one step further by closing OT processes for a range of ICS services.264|\n\n\n262 ‘Here comes the SunCrypt’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20201029-01A\n\n263 ‘KONNI’s KONsistency’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-QRT-20200117-01A\n\n\n-----\n\n## Sectors\n\n###### In this section, we highlight key cyber threats across different sectors, observed in 2020.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe PwC Threat Intelligence team issued 342 intelligence reports in 2020 covering a range of sectors and\nthreat actor locations, as seen below.\n\n**Figure 13 – Location of threat actor**\n\n\n###### 93 86 63 44 42 14 8 8 5 4 2 2 1\n\nCount\n\n\n**Figure 14 – Report sector**\n\nGovernment 144\n\n\nTechnology & telecommunications 70\n\nAerospace & defence 63\n\n\nFinancial services 47\n\nTransport & logistics 47\n\n\nHealthcare & pharma 45\n\nEducation 41\n\n\nManufacturing 27\n\n\nPower & utilities 27\n\nCharity/non-governmental organisation 23\n\n\nProfessional services 19\n\nOil & gas 18\n\n\nEntertainment & media 17\n\nRetail 16\n\n\nConstruction 11\n\nHospitality & leisure 10\n\n\nConsumer markets 7\n\nLegal 5\n\n\nInsurance 4\n\n\nCount\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Education\n\n\nIn 2020, we saw a great deal of activity targeting\nthe education sector, particularly towards higher\neducation institutions.\n\nEspionage activity has likely reflected long term\nstrategic priorities such as the collection of\nresearch and data related to research of economic,\nmilitary or geopolitical interest, or the monitoring\noverseas student communities for dissident\nactivity. This has included an ongoing focus by\nthreat actors such as Yellow Nabu (a.k.a. Silent\nLibrarian), an Iran-based threat actor which has\ncontinued to conduct credential phishing\ncampaigns targeting universities across the world,\nand operate sites for the sale and distribution of\ndocuments stolen in its intrusions.[265]\n\nWe also observed threat actors targeting the sector\nfor the first time in activity likely reflecting wider\nstrategic objectives. This included Russia-based\nthreat actor Blue Callisto which targeted at least\ntwo UK universities, as well as UK government\norganisations. The threat actor used phishing\n\n\n###### Technology & telecommunications\n\n\nOrganisations in the technology and\ntelecommunications sector are high value targets,\nnot only for their intellectual property, but also as\npart of supply chain attacks. This has come into\nsharp focus yet again in late 2020 following the\nSolarWinds compromise, which in turn led to the\npotential compromise of many of its customers.[268]\n\nWe also observed TSCookie backdoor samples,\nuniquely associated with Red Djinn (a.k.a.\nBlackTech), signed with a value digital certificate\nbelonging to a Chinese high-tech and\nsupercomputers manufacturer. There is a realistic\nprobability these were stolen from the manufacturer\nin an attempt to bypass application blocking.[269]\n\nIn the telecommunications sector, we observed an\nespionage campaign targeting several\norganisations across Vietnam, China and India\nwhich we attribute to Scarlet Ioke.[270] The threat\n\n\npages based on cloned Microsoft Office365 login\npages in order to obtain credentials, which we\nassessed were likely later used to compromise the\ntargeted organisations.[266]\n\nAs discussed in the Crime section, ransomware\ncontinued to be a major threat to all sectors.\nEducational institutions remain a popular target as\nthey offer an essential service, making the potential\neconomic payoff for ransomware actors\nsubstantial. For example, in June 2020, the\nUniversity of California, San Francisco (UCSF) fell\nvictim to ransomware that encrypted a limited\nnumber of servers within the university’s School of\nMedicine, making them temporarily inaccessible. It\nis likely that NetWalker ransomware[267] was used in\nthis incident, which resulted in a payment of over\nUSD 1 million. Other cyber crime threats such as\ndistributed denial-of-service (DDoS) extortion\nattacks have remained a threat, particularly given\nthe greater reliance on remote teaching.\n\nactor sideloaded a malicious DLL into memory\nusing a legitimate version of WinWord and\nultimately deployed Cobalt Strike payloads.\n\nThroughout 2020, we observed Red Phoenix (a.k.a\nAPT27, Emissary Panda), target and compromise\nseveral technology companies in several countries.\nThese included manufacturers of network devices,\nand security software.\n\nRed Charon (a.k.a. Chimera), a threat actor PwC\nevicted from several semiconductor and advanced\nmaterials organisations from 2014-2016, before an\napparent period of inactivity, resumed operations\naggressively in 2020. The threat actor continued to\ndemonstrate an interest in the high tech industry,\nbut also a specific focus on low cost airlines in\nEurope, using several bespoke malware families,\nand abusing a variety of cloud services for\ncommand and control and data exfiltration.\n\n\n265 ‘Uni is back in Session with Yellow Nabu, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20200915-01A\n\n266 ‘Blue Callisto targets UK Government and Universities’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20200820-01A\n\n267 ‘The rise of NetWalker’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20200612-02A\n\n268 This is discussed further in the section, ‘An endless supply… of supply chain compromise’\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Case study\n\n**Telecommunications company attacked through trusted relationship**\n\n\nPwC’s Incident Response team assisted a Hong\nKong-headquartered telecommunications company\nwhich constantly suffered attacks from a business\npartner network. The organisation discovered that\na threat actor gained access to a server inside a\ndata centre which serves a team of call centre\nagents for the client. The data centre had operator\nworkstations and servers with direct connectivity\nwith the client’s server farm. The threat actor\nleveraged the hacked server as a pivot point to\ninfiltrate into the client’s internal network through\nlegacy system vulnerabilities and credential\nbrute-forcing. After gaining initial access, the threat\nactor brought in common tools for enumeration\n(e.g. nbtscan), lateral movement, (e.g. PsExec) and\ncredentials dumping (e.g. Mimikatz and\nsecretsdump). After obtaining domain\nadministrative privileges, the attacker continued to\nmove laterally around the network before it was\ndetected and its access was removed.\n\nWhile our client identified and restricted access\nfrom the server that initiated the attack, the threat\nactor continued to find ways back into the network.\nIt started to compromise other endpoints within the\n\n\ndata centre and used these as pivots to conduct\nother forms of attack against the client, leveraging\nthe trusted relationship of the business partnership\nto connect back to the network.\n\nFor network pivoting, the attacker used the\nWindows built-in command line utility netsh to\ncreate a port-proxy on the operator endpoints in\nthe data centre, which are trusted with direct\nconnectivity to the client network. Other than\ncredentials reuse, lateral movement and theft of\nnew credentials, the threat actor also utilised an\nexploit of the Zerologon vulnerability (CVE-20201472) to achieve domain compromise.\n\nThe threat actor was once again removed from the\nnetwork upon the detection of its activities, due to\nthe service outage brought by the side effect of the\nexploit. The client subsequently performed a\ncomplete review of the network connectivity\nbetween the business partners as well as other\nnetwork demarcation points, and further\nsegmented the server network to isolate the legacy\nzones and business partner network zone.\n\n\n###### Aerospace and defence\n\n\nThe aerospace and defence sector has long been a\ntarget for espionage given the sensitivity of the\ninformation it holds, where links to military\napplications will make many organisations in the\nsector a valuable strategic target.\n\n- We observed North Korea-based threat actors\n\ncontinuing to target the sector throughout 2020,\nwith Black Banshee targeting defence\ncompanies in South Korea and Europe, and\nBlack Artemis as part of its ShowState\ncampaign.[271]\n\n- We observed a Russian-language lure\n\ndocument containing information concerning\nthe 2020 Seattle Aerospace and Defence\nSupplier Summit conference, which exploited\n\n\nthe Equation Editor vulnerability (CVE-20180798) to deliver a Bisonal backdoor payload. We\nattributed this activity to Red Beifang.[272]\n\n- Yellow Garuda was observed spoofing the\n\ndomains of two satellite imagery and analytics\ncompanies based in the US and France\nbetween September and October 2020. We\nassess this activity was likely intended to phish\ncredentials and access mailboxes related to the\ncompanies or their clients.[273]\n\n- In 2020, Yellow Liderc targeted large aerospace\n\nand defence manufacturers as well as engine\nmanufacturers and airlines.[274]\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Financial services\n\n\nThe financial services sector is a prime target for\nfinancially motivated cyber crime given the\nsignificant capital it holds. Cryptocurrency\nexchanges continued to be a popular target given\nthe relative ease at which threat actors can transfer\nand obscure their stolen currency. North Koreabased threat actors have conducted operations in\nthis space including the targeting of entities\ninvolved in blockchain products and research in\n2020.[275] More general cyber crime activity such as\nBEC remains a threat to organisations in the sector,\nas highlighted by the 2020 Norfund fraud\nincident.[276]\n\n\n###### Retail & consumer markets\n\n\nFinancially motivated cyber crime remains the\nlargest threat to the sector due to the volume of\nmonetary transactions that take place.\n\nAs seen in the Cyber crime section, ransomware\nattacks have affected organisations in the retail and\nconsumer sector above all others, and with the\nadvent of leak sites, this has posed new risks\nparticularly pertaining to customer data.\n\nThe compromise of ecommerce platforms through\nJavaScript-based malware – more commonly\nknown as Magecart – continued throughout 2020,\nalthough this activity has been largely\n\n\nWe also observed Red Djinn spoofing the domain\nof a Taiwanese financial services company in a\nlikely attempt to target the sector for espionage\npurposes. This activity was related to a sample of\nthe Bluether variant of the PLEAD malware family.[277]\n\nIn September 2020, we uncovered a series of\ncampaigns which delivered Cobalt Strike using a\nunique dropper we call xStart. We assess this was\nused to target organisations in China across a\nnumber of sectors, including financial services, for\nespionage-motivated activity. We currently track\nthis activity as White Dev 50.[278, 279]\n\novershadowed by higher profile ransomware\nincidents. With a growing emphasis on online retail,\nin part propelled by national lockdowns, this\nactivity is likely to continue as more organisations\nlook to rapidly increase their online presence.\n\nBEC attacks also remained a significant threat. We\nobserved an extensive phishing campaign\nbeginning in June 2020 targeting a range of sectors\nand geographies with financial themed lures.\nAlthough the activity was likely opportunistic in\nnature our analysis found the most targeted sectors\nto be consumer markets and manufacturing.[280]\n\n\n270 ‘Scarlet Ioke – June-July 2020 update’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20200806-01A\n\n271 This is discussed further in the section, ‘The view from Pyongyang’\n\n272 ‘Moscow to Mongolia with Bisonal and 8.t’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20200327-01A\n\n273 ‘A busy two months for Yellow Garuda’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20201109-01A\n\n274 This is discussed further in the section, ‘Yellow Liderc’\n\n275 This is discussed further in the section, ‘The view from Pyongyang’\n\n276 This is detailed in a case study in the section, ‘Business Email Compromise: continued persistence and increasing sophistication’\n\n277 ‘Red Djinn PLEADing assets’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-QRT-20200528-01A\n\n278 ‘xStart when you’re ready’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20200929-02A\n\n279 ‘Sign here to xStart’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20201229-01A\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Energy\n\n\nThe increasing convergence between operational\ntechnology (OT) and corporate IT environments\ncontinues to widen the potential attack surface to\nindustrial environments and lower the barrier to entry\nfor a wider range of threat actors. In 2020, EKANS\nransomware was found to kill specific industrial\ncontrol system (ICS) processes before activating its\nencryption routine.[281]\n\nIntelligence gathering activity remains a threat, in\npart due to the increasing competition in the sector,\nwhere new technologies, particularly pertaining to\ngreen technologies are likely to be highly sought\nafter. In July 2020, the United States Department of\nJustice (DOJ) unsealed an indictment against two\nChinese nationals, accused of conducting\nintelligence gathering cyber attacks in alignment to\n\n\n###### Transport\n\n\nIntelligence gathering activity has been at the\nforefront of targeting, particularly in aviation. During\n2020, several low cost airlines in Europe were\ntargeted by both Red Charon[287] and Yellow Liderc.[288 ]\n\nIn October 2020, an attack on San Francisco\nInternational Airport was attributed to Russiabased threat actor Blue Kraken.[289 ]Our analysis of IP\naddresses likely under the control of the threat\nactor indicated traffic associated with the wider\naviation supply chain and related third parties in\naddition to airports and airlines. This included\ntechnology companies developing software for use\nin aviation and organisations involved in lobbying\nand developing industry data and insights.[290]\n\n\nstate objectives, as well as financially motivated\nattacks for personal gain.[282, 283 ]The activity included\nthe compromise of the network of an Australian solar\nenergy engineering firm and stealing information\nrelated to high-efficiency gas turbines from a\nmechanical engineering company.\n\nThere have also been a number of high profile\nransomware incidents affecting the sector in 2020,\nlikely driven in part by the perceived wealth of\norganisations within the sector. Attacks involving\nRagnar Locker,[284] Sodinokibi[285] and Maze[286]\nransomware families have all resulted in the theft and\nleak of data, a tactic that has become increasingly\nprominent in ransomware attacks in general.\n\nAlthough ransomware remains a threat to all\norganisations, 2020 saw several victims in the\ntransport and logistics sectors.[291] These\norganisations were likely targeted as the high\nbusiness impact to their operations may make them\nmore likely to meet ransom demands. In August\n2020, international transport and logistics company\nTFI disclosed that four Canadian courier divisions\nwere impacted by a ransomware outbreak.[292 ]French\ncontainer transportation and shipping company,\nCMA CGM was targeted by Ragnar Locker\nransomware in September 2020. The company shut\ndown its online services as part of its containment\nstrategy.[293]\n\n\n281 ‘Slithering into plain sight: Ekans’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20200723-02A\n\n282 \u0007‘Two Chinese Hackers Working with the Ministry of State Security Charged with Global Computer Intrusion Campaign Targeting Intellectual Property and\n\nConfidential Business Information, Including COVID-19 Research’, the US Department of Justice, https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-chinese-hackers-workingministry-state-security-charged-global-computer-intrusion (21st July 2020)\n\n283 ‘You fool, ufo0lxy’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-SIB-20200811-01A\n\n284 \u0007‘Ragnar Locker ransomware hits EDP energy giant, asks for €10M’, Bleeping Computer, https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ragnarlocker\nransomware-hits-edp-energy-giant-asks-for-10m/ (14th April 2020)’\n\n285 \u0007‘Internal Data Stolen, Leaked, in REvil Attack on Electricity Market’s Elexon’, CBR, https://www.cbronline.com/news/elexon-hack-ransomware-revil (1st June 2020)\n\n286 \u0007‘Algerian petroleum JV hit by Maze ransomware, data posted online’, IT Wire, https://www.itwire.com/security/algerian-petroleum-jv-hit-by-maze-ransomware,\ndata-posted-online.html (6th April 2020)\n\n287 This is discussed further in the section, ‘Technology and telecommunications’\n\n288 This is discussed further in the section, ‘Yellow Liderc’\n\n289 \u0007Russian State-Sponsored Advanced Persistent Threat Actor Compromises U.S. Government Targets, CISA, https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-296a\n\n(22nd October 2020)\n\n290 ‘Dissecting Blue Kraken Visits’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20201106-03A\n\n291 ‘You’ve got Mailto’, PwC Threat Intelligence, CTO-TIB-20200320-01A\n\n292 \u0007‘Ransomware attack hits TFI’s Canadian courier divisions’, Freight Waves, https://www.freightwaves.com/news/breaking-news-tfi-ransomware-attack-hits\ncanadian-courier-divisions (23rd August 2020)\n\n293 \u0007CMA CGM confirms ransomware attack’, Lloyd’s List, https://lloydslist.maritimeintelligence.informa.com/LL1134044/CMA-CGM-confirms-ransomware-attack\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Conclusion\n\n2020 was an unpredictable year with the COVID-19\npandemic bringing an unprecedented change to the\nbusiness world and, as a result, to the cyber threat\nlandscape. The dependency on remote working\ninfrastructure has brought existing threats into\nprominence, such as the exploitation of vulnerabilities\nin VPNs, enterprise remote access and virtualisation\nsoftware.\n\nThreat actors have always made use of timely lures\nreflecting real-world events in their phishing\ncampaigns, and the pandemic has been no\nexception, with a plethora of related themes used by\ncyber crime and espionage threat actors alike.\nHowever, the majority of this activity was focussed on\nbusiness as usual operations. For espionage threat\nactors, we saw continued alignment to the strategic\nobjectives of nation states with tit-for-tat activity\nreflecting wider shifts in the geopolitical landscape.\nThe supply chain remained a prominent attack vector\nwith several high profile compromises in 2020.\n\n\nIn a continuation from 2019, there were several\ninstances of espionage threat actors being linked to\nfinancially motivated activity. These dual motivations\nare likely due to activity being performed for personal\ngain as opposed to a wider shift in operational\nobjectives. However the variation in activity, in terms\nof a deviation in expected targeting and tooling,\nprovides extra challenges in both defence and\nattribution efforts. 2020 also saw a number of\nhacker-for-hire operations publicly exposed, changing\nour traditional understanding of espionage activity.\n\nThe cyber crime scene has been dominated by\nransomware and the advent of leak sites. Victims\nmust now deal with the potential of sensitive data\nleaks and public exposure of the incidents, in addition\nto the business impact caused by the encryption. The\nsuccess of these operations saw a surge in new\nplayers and existing cyber crime groups expanding\ninto the field. This resulted in a definitive shift in the\ncyber threat landscape making ransomware\noperations a significant threat for organisations\nacross all sectors and geographies, in a trend that is\nlikely to continue throughout 2021.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### PwC Cyber Security\n\n\nIf you would like more information on any of the\nthreats discussed in this report please feel free to get\nin touch at threatintelligence@pwc.com.\n\nPwC is globally recognised by industry analysts as a\nleader in cyber security; as a firm with strong global\ndelivery capabilities, and the ability to address the\nsecurity and risk challenges our clients face.\n\nWe underpin our board-level security strategy and\nadvisory consulting services with expertise gleaned\nfrom the front lines of cyber defence across our niche\ntechnical expertise in services such as Managed\nCyber Defence, red teaming, incident response and\nthreat intelligence.\n\nWe differentiate ourselves with our ability to combine\nstrategic thinking, strong technical capabilities and\ncomplex engagement delivery with client service\nexcellence.
