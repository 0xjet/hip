We call this_\n_report our “Intelligence Insights” and share a public version of it with the broader infosec_\n_community._\n\n## Highlights\n\nAs we’ve done for the past few months, we again looked at the 10 most prevalent threats\nencountered in the environments that Red Canary monitors. These prevalence rankings are\nbased on the number of unique customer environments in which we observed each threat.\nHere’s how the numbers shook out for December 2021:\n\n**December rank** **Threat name** **Percent of customers affected**\n\n\nDecember rank:\n⬆1\n\n\nThreat name:\nSocGholish\n\n\nPercent of customers affected:\n1.8%\n\n\n-----\n\n**December rank** **Threat name** **Percent of customers affected**\n\n\nDecember rank:\n⬆ 2\n\nDecember rank:\n⬇ 3\n\nDecember rank:\n⬆ 4\n\nDecember rank:\n⬆ 5*\n\nDecember rank:\n⬆ 5*\n\nDecember rank:\n⬇ 7\n\nDecember rank:\n➡ 8*\n\nDecember rank:\n⬆ 8*\n\nDecember rank:\n⬆ 8*\n\n\nThreat name:\n[Mimikatz](https://redcanary.com/threat-detection-report/threats/mimikatz/)\n\nThreat name:\nImpacket\n\nThreat name:\n[TA551](https://redcanary.com/threat-detection-report/threats/ta551/)\n\nThreat name:\nGootkit\n\nThreat name:\n[Gamarue](https://redcanary.com/threat-detection-report/threats/gamarue/)\n\nThreat name:\n[Qbot](https://redcanary.com/threat-detection-report/threats/qbot/)\n\nThreat name:\nTR\n\nThreat name:\nConficker\n\nThreat name:\nMetasploit Framework\n\n\nPercent of customers affected:\n1.8%\n\nPercent of customers affected:\n1.6%\n\nPercent of customers affected:\n1.3%\n\nPercent of customers affected:\n1.2%\n\nPercent of customers affected:\n1.2%\n\nPercent of customers affected:\n1.1%\n\nPercent of customers affected:\n0.9%\n\nPercent of customers affected:\n0.9%\n\nPercent of customers affected:\n0.9%\n\n\n⬆ = trending up from previous month\n\n⬇= trending down from previous month\n\n➡ = no change in rank from previous month\n\n*Denotes a tie\n\n## Observations on trending threats\n\n**For the fourth consecutive month, we have a new threat at the top of our prevalence**\n**rankings. This time SocGholish made the ascent. The emergence of BLISTER malware as**\na follow-on payload (more on that below) may be related to this rise, and the 1.8% of\ncustomers affected is SocGholish’s high water mark for the year\n\n\n-----\n\n**Cobalt Strike, a mainstay of the top five spots every month this year, curiously**\n**dropped all the way down to the twelfth spot. Only ~0.5% of customers saw Cobalt**\nStrike detections in December, after 11 straight months of over 1% seeing Cobalt Strike,\nwith a peak of 3.2% of customers back in June. It remains to be seen if this represents a\nshift in tooling or TTPs by adversaries, or if this was merely a holiday lull for both red\nteamers and post-exploitation adversaries. In any case, Red Canary detection engineers\nare maintaining a vigilant watch on these and other threats.\n\n**New Conficker detection analytic identifies old persistence. Speaking of expanded**\ndetection coverage, you may have noticed Conficker, that years-old nuisance, creeping into\nthe bottom of our rankings. This is not a re-emergence of a new threat, but an artifact of\ndeploying a new detection analytic to shine a light on an old persistence technique hidden\nin a dark, and often overlooked, corner. In most instances, the malicious DLL payload of\nthese Conficker cases was likely removed by antivirus long ago. However, the lingering\npersistence mechanism attempting to launch those randomly named libraries tends to\nlanguish in the labyrinth of the registry long after antivirus declares the threat removed.\nExpanding detection coverage does not just uncover new and novel threats, it also adds\nlayers of defenses to ensure more complete and thorough clean-up of the closed out cases\nof the past.\n\nAccordingly, we can add Conficker to the compendium of older threats with worming\ncapabilities that are still finding their way into places they don’t belong. If you’re seeing\nConficker detections, one way to harden your attack surface is to ensure you’re running an\nup-to-date OS. You may also want to consider disabling AutoRun and checking over those\nfirewall rules one last time, just to make sure you aren’t haunted by any residual Conficker\ninfections wandering about come the next holiday season.\n\n### Detection opportunity: Rundll32 executing with command lines consistent with Conficker\n\nprocess_ name == `rundll32.exe`\n\n&&\ncommand_line_contains == `rundll32\\.exe [a-z]{5,8}\\.[a-z]{1,3},[a-z]{5,8}`\n\n**_Note: If you are having trouble getting this detection opportunity to work in your_**\n_environment, you may find additional success by focusing only on processes where_\n```\ntaskeng.exe or svchost.exe are the parents of rundll32 .\n\n## Adversaries find a juicy Log4j target in VMware Horizon\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nSince public disclosures of the Log4j vulnerabilities began on December 9, we ve been\ntracking threats that have exploited them. We realized the attack surface using Log4j was\nhuge, but in the first several weeks, the activity we observed consisted mostly of scanning,\ntesting, and coinminers.\n\n### Detection opportunity: PowerShell listing VMBlastSG service names\n\nThis analytic identifies PowerShell executing a command to return a list of service names\ncontaining `VMBlastSG . This may assist in identifying post-exploitation as described in this`\n[excellent NHS alert, similar to the following, which invokes](https://digital.nhs.uk/cyber-alerts/2021/cc-3989) `Get-WMIObject on`\n```\nwin32_service to return service names:\npowershell -c \"$path=gwmi win32_service|?{$.Name -like \"\"\"VMBlastSG\"\"\"}|%\n{$.PathName -replace '\"\"\"', '' -replace \"\"\"nssm.exe\"\"\",\"\"\"lib\\absgworker.js\"\"\"}\n\n```\nprocess_name== powershell.exe\n\n&&\ncommand_line_contains == VMBlastSG\n\n**The nature of recently disclosed Log4j vulnerabilities may have contributed to the**\n**volume and delayed timing of activity observed in the wild. One of the reasons we did**\nnot observe a large volume of exploitation in the first few days may be that these\nvulnerabilities are highly application-specific, depending on how Log4j is implemented in\nthem. This means an adversary could not have crafted a single exploit that would have had\na broad impact on many types of applications at once.\n\n**Toward late December and early January, however, we observed an uptick in**\n**adversaries exploiting internet-facing VMware Horizon servers running versions**\n**affected by the Log4J vulnerabilities. While we couldn’t attribute all activity to named**\nadversaries, we observed likely PROPHET SPIDER activity in one environment, and\npatterns suggesting a potentially different adversary in other environments. Others in the\n[community, including the UK NHS and](https://digital.nhs.uk/cyber-alerts/2022/cc-4002) [Microsoft, observed the same pattern of adversaries](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/12/11/guidance-for-preventing-detecting-and-hunting-for-cve-2021-44228-log4j-2-exploitation/)\n[targeting VMware Horizon. This supplements earlier reporting about Conti ransomware](https://www.advintel.io/post/ransomware-advisory-log4shell-exploitation-for-initial-access-lateral-movement)\noperators exploiting VMware vCenter during lateral movement in an environment. When\nviewed together, this reporting and our direct visibility suggests VMware Horizon is a top\nchoice for adversaries to narrow their Log4j targeting, likely because it is widely used and\noften internet-facing. We recommend everyone using VMware Horizon immediately\n**[apply updates and evaluate whether it needs to be internet-facing.](https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2021-0028.html)**\n\n## SocGholish causing BLISTERs?\n\n\n-----\n\n[In December, Elastic Security published research exposing BLISTER, a newly discovered](https://www.elastic.co/blog/elastic-security-uncovers-blister-malware-campaign)\nloader that may contain Cobalt Strike beacons or other remote access tools. This threat\nevades static signatures by splicing malicious code into a legitimate Windows executable\nwhile preserving most of the original executable’s structure and content. Elastic observed\nBLISTER coming from malicious installers, and we observed a slightly different pattern:\nSocGholish deploying BLISTER. In at least one instance in December, we observed\nSocGholish deploying BLISTER, which deployed a Cobalt Strike beacon.\n\nThis development shows that adversaries are actively using multiple methods to\n**distribute BLISTER and its subsequent payloads. BLISTER itself is evasive, hindering**\nstatic analysis and detection rules.\n\n## Managing the increase in ManageEngine vulnerabilities\n\nIn December 2021, Red Canary observed activity associated with the likely exploitation of\nvulnerabilities in two Zoho ManageEngine products: ADSelfService Plus and ServiceDesk\nPlus. The FBI also reported in-the-wild exploitation of a vulnerability in a third\nManageEngine product, Desktop Central. Given the frequency with which vulnerabilities in\nManageEngine have been recently disclosed and the speed at which adversaries can\nexploit these newly reported weaknesses, Red Canary focuses on identifying and detecting\npost-exploitation behavior, and we recommend others do the same to identify malicious\nactivity, regardless of how adversaries accessed the environment.\n\n### Detection opportunity: Java.exe writing msiexec.exe to disk\n\nprocess_name == `java.exe`\n\nfile_modification == `msiexec.exe`\n\n**[ADSelfService Plus (CVE-2021-40539)](https://www.manageengine.com/products/self-service-password/kb/how-to-fix-authentication-bypass-vulnerability-in-REST-API.html)**\n\n[As noted previously in our December Intelligence Insights, we’ve consistently observed](https://redcanary.com/blog/intelligence-insights-december-2021/)\noperators dropping web shells and using `keytool.exe, a Java utility, after exploiting what`\nappears to be CVE-2021-40539. Separately, in one incident response engagement, our\npartner observed a ransomware attack after operators gained initial access via exploitation\nof CVE-2021-40539.\n\n**[ServiceDesk Plus (CVE-2021-44077)](https://pitstop.manageengine.com/portal/en/community/topic/security-advisory-authentication-bypass-vulnerability-in-servicedesk-plus-versions-11138-and-above?int-security-response)**\n\nWe’ve also observed CVE-2021-44077, a vulnerability in ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus,\nlikely exploited to upload a malicious executable and conduct post-exploitation\nreconnaissance. Behavior exploiting this vulnerability—in concert with a binary\nmasquerading as `msiexec.exe —appears to overlap with the TiltedTemple campaign`\n[recently reported by researchers at Palo Alto Unit 42.](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/tiltedtemple-manageengine-servicedesk-plus/)\n\n\n-----\n\n**[Desktop Central (CVE-2021-44515)](https://www.manageengine.com/products/desktop-central/cve-2021-44515-authentication-bypass-filter-configuration.html)**\n\nThe FBI released a FLASH notification detailing APT exploitation of a third ManageEngine\nvulnerability, this time in a Desktop Central MSP server, part of ManageEngine’s Desktop\nCentral product. Following successful exploitation of this vulnerability, the FBI reported that\nadversaries drop a web shell, conduct reconnaissance, and use BITSAdmin to download\nadditional tools.\n\nThough Red Canary has not observed successful exploitation of this vulnerability first-hand,\n[credible reporting from CISA and the FBI highlights the risks associated with the follow-on](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/current-activity/2021/12/10/cisa-adds-thirteen-known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog)\nactivity successful exploitation can enable. Tracking public reporting on vulnerabilities such\nas CVE-2021-44515 allows us to add context to threats associated with common software\nand tailor our detection coverage to cover tradecraft highlighted by other sources in the\ncommunity.\n\n**ManageEngine products are widely used among IT departments, presenting a large**\n**attack surface for adversaries. Organizations using ManageEngine products in their**\n**environment should update accordingly. Patches for all of the vulnerabilities listed here**\nhave been released and are available via ManageEngine.\n\nAs always, the assessments in this report represent our best thinking based on our current\nvisibility.
