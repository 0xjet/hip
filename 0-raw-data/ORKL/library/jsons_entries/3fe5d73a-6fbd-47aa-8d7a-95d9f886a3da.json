There are strong overlaps in terms of code\n\nsimilarities, packers, TTPs and configurations.\n\n- SentinelLabs assesses with high confidence that the Macaw ransomware variant is derived\n\nfrom the same codebase as Hades.\n\n- A portion of SocGholish infrastructure, controlled by EC, and used to deliver WastedLocker\n\nand Hades Ransomware, was also used to spread BitPaymer and DoppelPaymer by\n\n\ndeploying Dridex\n\n\n1 loader.\n\n\n\n  - Since late 2019, Evil Corp has been evolving their tradecraft in order to continue to pivot\n\naround OFAC sanctions.\n\n  - CryptOne: throughout our analysis we noticed the unique use of a crypter tool dubbed\n\n“CryptOne”. We were able to identify and map all of the CryptOne ‘flavours’ used in\n\ndifferent time-frames. This supported our clustering of EC activity, through the correlation\n\nof those signatures.\n\nThis report summarizes an in-depth analysis of Evil Corp (“EC”, a.k.a “Gold Drake”, a.k.a\n\n“Indrik Spider”), an advanced cybercrime activity cluster originating from Russia, performed by\n\nSentinelLabs. As a result of this research and previous intelligence, we were able to cluster a\n\nrange of EC’s malware lineage and their activities. This investigation raises new insights about the\n\ngroup’s modus operandi and toolsets.\n\nPlease note: While EC is a name of a cyber crime gang, run by several known individual members,\n\n_this report refers to the activity as it is seen through TTPs. We believe that this approach is more_\n\n_accurate to describe and track their operations. A list of IOC’s and YARA rules can be found at_\n\n_the end of this report._\n\n#### S e n t i n e l L a b s Te a m\n\n\n-----\n\n### BACKGROUND\n\nEvil Corp (“EC”, a.k.a “Gold Drake”, a.k.a “Indrik Spider”), is an advanced cybercrime operations\n\ncluster originating from Russia and has been active since 2007. The UK National Crime Agency\n\n\ncalls it “the world’s most harmful cyber crime group.”\n\n\n2\n\n\nThe origins of Evil Corp can be traced back to Evgeniy Bogachev, one of the leading figures of the\n\n\ngroup. Evgeniy Bogachev (also known as Slavik) developed the [Zeus banking trojan](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/control-panel-in-new-zeus-variant-reveals-sophistication-of-crime-rings/)\n\n\n3. Bogachev\n\n\nconsidered to be the leader of the “Business Club”, a group of half-dozen people supported by a\n\nnetwork of more than 50 individuals tied with the Russian Government. An award of 3 million dollars\n\nwas announced for information that would lead to his capture. In 2011, the Zeus source code was\n\nleaked and different versions appeared in the wild. In September 2011, a new Zeus variant named\n\nGameover Zeus (also known as Zeus Game Over, GoZ) was identified. It added a peer-to-peer C2\n\narchitecture that was more resilient to takedown, with the intention to mislead law enforcement.\n\nBy mid 2014, GoZ counted over 27 different botnets, one million compromised computers and\n\nwas responsible for the theft of tens of millions of dollars. Slavik was the administrator of the GoZ\n\nBotnet, and had the support of the Business Club crew. This support from the Business Club crew\n\nintroduced Slavik to Maksim Yakubets. This partnership would come to form the backbone of what\n\nis now EC.\n\nMaksim Yakubets (aka “aqua”) is believed to have acted as Evil Corp group’s leader (the last\n\n\nofficial document which describe him as a leader is from 5 Dec 2019\n\n\n4). The group was one of\n\n\nthe pioneers of financial cybercrime, having operated one of the most aggressive and successful\n\nBanking trojans since 2014, Dridex. Evil Corp has earned millions of dollars in illicit profit from\n\nbanks and financial institutions in over 40 countries.\n\nIn August 2017, EC’s began to focus on more high-return targets with BitPaymer Ransomware,\n\ndelivering the ransomware with Dridex mainly against North American and Western European\n\n\n6 (or a sub\n\norganizations. In June 2019, the cluster DoppelSpider\n\n\n5, considered a distinct group\n\n\ncluster of EC), started operating a new ransomware dubbed DoppelPaymer. It was a new strain\n\nderived from BitPaymer’s codebase and operated as a RaaS. It presented an important similarity\n\nwith its predecessor but also implemented new features like multithreaded file encryption.\n\nDoppelPaymer was operated in parallel with BitPaymer; supporting the assessment that it was a\n\ndistinct cluster.\n\n2https://twitter.com/NCA_UK/status/1202618928209498114?s=20\n\n3https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/cyber/evgeniy-mikhailovich-bogachev\n\n4https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm845\n\n5https://adversary.crowdstrike.com/en-US/adversary/doppel-spider/\n\n6https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/doppelpaymer-ransomware-and-dridex-2/\n\n\n-----\n\nIn December 2019, the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)\n\n\n7 issued\n\n\na sanction against 17 individuals and seven entities related to EC cyber operations for causing\n\nfinancial losses of more than 100 million dollars with Dridex. In addition to the OFAC sanction, the\n\nDOJ charged two key members of the group: Maksim Yakubets and Igor Turashe; both members\n\nof the “Business Club” and considered the developers of the Dridex banking trojan. Yakubets was\n\nalso mentioned as the leader of the group. In May 2020, following the OFAC which put Dridex under\n\nthe scope of the sanction, a new ransomware variant appeared in the wild dubbed WastedLocker.\n\nIt employs techniques to obfuscate its code and perform tasks similar to those already seen in\n\nBitPaymer and Dridex. Those similarities allowed the threat intelligence community to identify the\n\n\nconnections between the malware families\n\n\n8.\n\n\nRight after the indictment we witnessed a change in some of their TTPs: from 2020, they started\n\nto frequently change their payload signatures, using different exploitation tools and methods of\n\ninitial access. They switched from Dridex to the SocGholish framework to confuse attribution and\n\ndistance themselves from both Dridex and Bitpaymer, which fell within the scope of the sanctions.\n\nDuring this period they started using Cobalt Strike extensively to gain an initial foothold and\n\nperform lateral movement instead of PowerShell Empire.\n\nAt this point, after the indictments, the global intelligence community was split into different\n\n“camps’’ as to how EC was operating. Some assessed that there was a voluntary transition of\n\nEC operations to another ‘trusted’ partner while remaining the controller of operations. Some\n\nhad theories that they stopped operating and another advanced actor operated Hades trying to\n\n\nmimic the same MO as EC to mislead attribution. Some claim\n\n\n9 possible attribution to the HAFNIUM\n\n\nactivity cluster. This report argues that the original operators continue to be active despite the\n\nsanctions, continuously changing their TTPs in order to stay under the radar.\n\nIn December 2020, a new ransomware variant named Hades was first seen in the wild and publicly\n\n\nreported\n\n\n10. Hades is a 64-bit compiled version of WastedLocker that displays important code and\n\n\nfunctionality overlaps\n\n\n11. In March 2021, a new variant Phoenix Locker appeared in the wild, which\n\n\nseemed to be a rebranded version of Hades with little to no changes\n\n\n12. Later, a new variant named\n\n\nPayloadBIN appeared in the wild\n\n\n13, a continuation from Phoenix Locker. Another distinctive MO\n\n\nworth mentioning which characterizes all their ransomware operations is related to the extortion\n\nphase. Security researchers from several private sector firms note that historically there was no\n\n\nevidence of data theft during BitPaymer and WastedLocker incidents\n\ndidn’t operate any data leak site.\n\n7https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm845\n\n\n14. In addition to this, they\n\n\n8https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2020/08/04/wastedlocker-techniques-point-to-a-familiar-heritage/\n\n9https://awakesecurity.com/blog/incident-response-hades-ransomware-gang-or-hafnium/\n\n10https://twitter.com/demonslay335/status/1339324224029274118?s=20\n\n11https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/hades-ransomware-successor-to-indrik-spiders-wastedlocker/\n\n12section Hades vs. Phoenix Locker: A polymorphic code of this report\n\n13https://twitter.com/fwosar/status/1401110845820747797?s=20\n\n\n-----\n\n### THE EVIL CORP MALWARE LINEAGE\n\n**EVIL CORP AFFILIATION MODEL**\n\nDridex first appeared on the scene in June 2014. It was derived from Bugat V5. EC operates\n\nDridex with an affiliation model, where each affiliate maintains control of a subset of bots while\n\nEC controls all the C2 backends.\n\n\nDridex has also been delivered by [Emotet](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/inside-emotet-banking-trojan-malware-distributor/) since 2017\n\n\n15. This suggests that there is a functional\n\n\nrelationship between the two groups (they share resources). Moreover, research by Trend Micro\n\n\nhighlighted that Emotet, Gozi IFSB and Dridex share the same loader\n\n\n16. Following the distribution\n\n\nof Dridex v4 binaries (botnet IDs 199 and 501) a new update in the TTPs has been observed,\n\nin fact they began using Dridex to execute PowerShell Empire and the Koadic post-exploitation\n\n\nframework\n\n\n17.\n\n\nDridex was also the primary delivery method for BitPaymer Ransomware. Following the OFAC\n\nsanctions, in March 2020, WastedLocker was delivered exclusively through SocGholish. Ever since,\n\nSocGholish has been associated with the delivery of other malware that SentinelLabs attributes to\n\nEC activity, suggesting that SocGholish is a solid indicator of EC’s recent activity.\n\nIn the following diagram we draw connections or affiliations between Evil Corp and other actors.\n\nThe dark blue rectangles represent threat actors, the orange are related to malware families and\n\nloaders while the red ones are related to ransomware. The nature of the relationship is annotated\n\non the arrow.\n\n14https://www.zdnet.com/article/hacker-gang-behind-garmin-attack-doesnt-have-a-history-of-stealing-user-data/?&web_view=true\n\n15https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2017/08/10/watch-out-for-emotet-the-trojan-thats-nearly-a-worm/\n\n16https://www.trendmicro.com/it_it/research/18/l/ursnif-emotet-dridex-and-bitpaymer-gangs-linked-by-a-similar-loader.html\n\n17https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2019/10/head-fake-tackling-disruptive-ransomware-attacks.html\n\n\n-----\n\nFig 1: The EvilCorp affiliation diagram\n\n**A UNIQUE CLUSTER: BITPAYMER, WASTEDLOCKER, HADES, PHOENIX LOCKER, PAYLOADBIN**\n\nClustering activity is the hardest part of tracking cybercrime, previous analysis of cybercrime\n\nactivities revealed that often there are different kinds of affiliations between threat actors with\n\nvarying degrees of trust. To cluster activities with confidence, it is important to find strong and\n\nnon ambiguous relationships and assess them in order to understand their nature, the role of\n\neach actor and the modus operandi. In this section we provide evidence of code overlaps, shared\n\nconfigurations, packers used and TTPs supporting the assessment that Bitpaymer, WastedLocker,\n\nHades, PhoenixLocker and PayloadBIN share a simila codebase.\n\nWe decided to reassess the relationship between ransomware variants which have been analyzed\n\nbefore and attributed to EC. This analysis provides the foundation on which we examine further\n\nchanges and evolutions. We compared each variant with its ancestor in a chronological order.\n\n\n-----\n\nFig 2\n\n\n**BITPAYMER VS. WASTEDLOCKER**\n\n\nPrevious research\n\n\n18 shows a sort of knowledge re-use between these 2 families, which share the\n\n\nsame heritage. The main similarities found in that research are:\n\n  - Abuse of Alternate Data Streams (ADS);\n\n  - Customized API resolving method;\n\n  - Similar UAC bypass;\n\n  - Encryption methods;\n\n  - Ransom note;\n\n  - Same style of command-line arguments;\n\n  - Victim specific elements are added using a specific builder rather than at compile time\n\n**WASTEDLOCKER VS. HADES**\n\n\n19.\n\n\nThe two families implemented different instruction sets, in addition, the standard win32 API was\n\n\nrewritten in Hades as native API from NTDLL. Previous research\n\nand differences between the two ransomware families:\n\n\n20 assessed the main similarities\n\n\n\n- Different UAC bypass methods: both taken from UACME project\n\n\n21\n\n\n\n  - Generalization: Hades does not contain victim information in the ransom note whereas\n\nWastedLocker does, and instead contains a tox channel in order to communicate and\n\nnegotiate with victims\n\n  - Hades does not use ADS whereas WastedLocker and BitPaymer do\n\n  - Hades stores key information in each encrypted file while WastedLocker and Bitpaymer\n\nstore key information inside a ransom note;\n\n18https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2020/08/04/wastedlocker-techniques-point-to-a-familiar-heritage/\n\n19https://research.nccgroup.com/2020/06/23/wastedlocker-a-new-ransomware-variant-developed-by-the-evil-corp-group/\n\n20https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/hades-ransomware-successor-to-indrik-spiders-wastedlocker/\n\n21https://github.com/hfiref0x/UACME\n\n\n-----\n\nSentinelLabs discovered that Hades and WastedLocker share the same codebase. We assess it is\n\nalmost certain that they come from the same ‘factory’ (the same developer or group of developers).\n\nThere are important overlaps between the two families, which are summarized below. For our\n\nsimilarity analysis we considered the following samples from both families:\n\n**Compilation** **Submission**\n**Family** **Sha256 Packed** **Sha256 unpacked**\n\n**timestamp** **to VT**\n\n905ea119ad8d3e54 965a7ae835ea9c53\ncd228c458a1b5681 c9617fc337317c79\n\n**WastedLocker** 2020-07-22 2020-07-23\n\nabc1f35df782977a 9222094846d6a2b7\n23812ec4efa0288a 761dfae1f594aec3\n\nfe997a590a68d98f 4bb5636c13adf39d\n95ac0b6c994ba69c 07f6d09506065b4\n\n**Hades** 2020-12-20 2021-01-07\n\n3b2ece9841277b7 a727b6c3c348967a\nfecd9dfaa6f589a87 be3f122b217be8e9a\n\n**FILE AND DIRECTORY ENUMERATION ROUTINE**\n\nBoth samples implement file and directory enumeration logic identically. Comparing the logic and\n\nthe Control Flow Graph of both routines, we concluded both ransomware use the same code for\n\nfile and directory enumeration.\n\nThe routines under scope are:\n\n\n-----\n\nFig 3: WastedLocker(left), Hades(right). “Similarity of file and dir enumeration routine function”.\n\nOn the left side we have WastedLocker, while on the right side, Hades. Side-by-side, we noticed\n\nthe same structure between the above functions, and the same information was used to keep files\n\nfor encryption. Moreover, the same approach was used to allocate a memory heap (heapAlloc)\n\nthen zeroing the allocated memory with memset. The only difference in heap allocation is that\n\nHades groups the heapAlloc and the memset into one single function (f_call_HeapAlloc_and_\n\nzero_memory). Furthermore, the Control Flow Graphs of the two functions are almost identical:\n\nFig 4: WastedLocker(left), Hades(right). “CFG similarity of file and dir enumeration routine”.\n\n\n-----\n\n**DRIVES ENUMERATION ROUTINE:**\n\nWe found similarities between the functions responsible for drive enumeration. In the figures\n\nbelow, the two functions present nearly identical structures, and rely on the same Win32API for\n\ncritical sections management:\n\nFig 5: WastedLocker(left), Hades(right). “Drive enumeration routine similarities”.\n\n\n-----\n\n**RSA ENCRYPTION ROUTINE**\n\nDuring our investigation, we observed that the RSA functions - responsible for asymmetrically\n\nencrypting the keys which were used in the AES phase to encrypt files - are identical in both\n\nransomware, hinting that the same utility library was used.\n\nFig 6:WastedLocker(left), Hades(right). “same RSA implementation”.\n\n\nBoth Ransomware rely on the RSAREF\n\n\n22 crypto lib to implement the RSA algorithm and crypto utils\n\n\n(i.e md5sum). The RSAREF is not maintained anymore (last activity dates back about 5 years ago, at\n\nthe time of writing). This is a peculiar element because, to the best of our knowledge, no other known\n\nransomware families use this specific implementation. Further, the way the two implementations\n\nlook - their structure, the same RSA implementation, the same API pattern - led us to think that they\n\nare both developed by the same hand or relying on the same functions/code reuse.\n\n22https://sourceforge.net/projects/rsaref/\n\n\n-----\n\nFig 7:WastedLocker(left) uses API from RSAREF crypto lib(right)\n\nWhilst WastedLocker and Hades have striking similarities in file and directory enumeration, drive\n\nenumeration and RSA encryption, we also note some differences between the ransomwares. The\n\nmain differences between WastedLocker and Hades are summarized below:\n\n  - WastedLocker is a 32-bit PE while Hades is a 64-bit PE.\n\n  - Most of the file-related APIs for file management which were used in WastedLocker are\n\nreplaced by their lower-level ones. Some examples include:\n\n   - FindFirstFileW + FindNextFileW -> ZwCreateFile + ZwQueryDirectoryFile\n\n   - CreateFileW + WriteFileW + CloseHandle -> ZwCreateFile + ZwWriteFile + ZwClose\n\n   - MoveFileW -> ZwCreateFile + ZwSetInformationFile(..., FileRenameInformation)\n\n   - DeleteFileW -> ZwCreateFile + ZwSetInformationFile(..., FileDispositionInformation)\n\n  - While WastedLocker assembly code was left mostly unchanged, Hades assembly code\n\nwas modified heavily to hinder static analysis, similarity tools or emulation. Some\n\nmodifications include:\n\n   - Insertion of a wide range of no-op-codes, which modify the states of unused registers,\n\ntherefore not changing the outcome of functions.\n\n   - A small subset of APIs are imported dynamically at runtime, like: CryptAcquireContextW,\n\nCryptGenRandom and CryptReleaseContext.\n\n   - In their prolog, a few functions contain a call to subroutines which include somewhat\n\nmore esoteric op-codes and indirect calls.\n\n\n-----\n\nFig 8: WastedLocker(left), Hades(right). “A small subset\n\nof APIs are imported dynamically at runtime”.\n\nThe changes between WastedLocker and Hades served primarily to change the detection signature\n\nof the malware and make it more evasive. The similarities in implementation and code overlap\n\nhowever, suggest Hades is highly likely an evolution of WastedLocker.\n\n**HADES VS. PHOENIX LOCKER: A POLYMORPHIC CODE**\n\nFor this analysis, we investigated the following samples:\n\n**Compilation** **Submission**\n**Family** **Sha256 Packed** **Sha256 unpacked**\n\n**timestamp** **to VT**\n\ne657ff4838e47465 d62425b0bb7e2be\n3b55367aa9d4a06 b2a96839c1231457\n\n**Hades** 2021-03-06 2021-03-26\n\n41b35378e2e379ad 08644e4cc9a599b87\n0fdd1631b3b763ef0 11cbe1a5472527ea\n\n008ec7976532520 79d7706aff1e6f008\n0361d9c93ac35edd dc25b4b7e1dd2bd2\n\n**PhoenixLocker** 2021-03-20 2021-03-26\n\n430f8b17894ff8432 f9acd7cf6dfd89c96\n68caa5acd6224549 470203a684643a\n\nBoth payloads have the same compilation timestamp (orange column in the table below). This\n\nsuggested that the same ransomware payload (Hades in this case) was reused, but packed in two\n\ndifferent moments in time. The compiler and linker versions are also the same. This technique of\n\n\npayload reuse was also seen in BitPaymer\n\n\n23. Moreover they have a different “business” infrastructure:\n\n\ndifferent wallets, communication with the victim.\n\n23https://blog.morphisec.com/bitpaymer-ransomware-with-new-custom-packer-framework\n\n\n-----\n\nThe interesting observation is that the payload was compiled at the same time but presents a different\n\nhash. We confirmed that they reused a ‘clean’ Hades version each time, statically introducing junk\n\ncode with the help of a script in order to alter the signature.\n\n24see the timing analysis section\n\n25see the timing analysis section\n\n\n-----\n\nFig 9: Hades(left), PhoenixLocker(right). “A hex view of the .obX0 section”.\n\nFrom a first glance at both samples, it is clear that the .obX0 section is different (differences\n\nhighlighted in red), but the semantic of the code didn’t change, as suggested by the pseudo code\n\nview below:\n\nFig 10: Hades(left), PhoenixLocker(right). “A comparison of the enumerate file function”.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the figure below, the structure of both Hades and PhoenixLocker appear almost identical.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, the assembly instructions inside each block are different.\n\nThose instructions are highlighted in red (left side) and in blue (right side). The blue represents\n\nthe code added to the ‘clean’ version of Hades. All these introduced instructions don’t alter the\n\nsemantic, they were added with the sole purpose of improving the stealthiness of the ransomware\n\nby changing the static signature.\n\nFig 11: Hades(left), PhoenixLocker(right). “Polymorphic code added statically highlighted in red and blue”.\n\nFig 12: Hades(left), PhoenixLocker(right). “Polymorphic code added statically highlighted in red and blue”.\n\n\n-----\n\n**THE INCREMENTAL LINKING**\n\nBecause of the presence of jump thunks in the malware code, it might be the case that incremental\n\nlinking is enabled in the compilation process of the malware. This could explain why most functions\n\nare the same (except for the discussed polymorphic code changes which are introduced after\n\ncompilation), except those that were changed between December and April to recompile again.\n\n**PHOENIXLOCKER VS. PAYLOADBIN**\n\nIn this section, we compared the following two samples:\n\n**Compilation** **Submission**\n**Family** **Sha256 Packed** **Sha256 unpacked**\n\n**timestamp** **to VT**\n\n008ec7976532520 2E38FF7D2D382F227\n0361d9c93ac35edd 54D16E531B928DAD\n\n**PhoenixLocker** 2021-03-20 2021-03-26\n\n430f8b17894ff8432 BA48CD562B06787B\n68caa5acd6224549 DD5FA6CC681772E\n\n69775389eb0207f 8AA971223915DE40\nec3a3f5649a0ad931 7C8F8B8CCD722E26\n\n**PayloadBIN** 2021-06-02 2021-06-03\n\n5856c810f595c086 41C5C2A0A9998BB9\nac49d68cdbc1d136 ECDB06D864935D7A\n\nFig 13\n\nTaking these two samples we conducted a similarity analysis to deduce their connection. The\n\nsimilarity score between the two samples was slightly higher, with a value of 0.50. Taking a\n\ncloser look, we observed that the majority of the PayloadBIN functions overlap with its ancestor\n\nPhoenixLocker. There was a partial rewrite of the ransomware code however, justified by the\n\ncompilation timestamps of the unpacked payload, which is Wed Apr 28 11:04:49 2021 for\n\nPayloadBIN and Mon Dec 14 01:34:38 2020 for Phoenix Locker. This suggests EC had more than\n\n4 months to work on the improvement.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn this case, there are portions of the code that are completely rewritten and consolidated. There\n\nare also a lot of functions with significant overlap:\n\nFig 14\n\nFig 15: PayloadBIN (left) vs PhoenixLocker cryptolocker (right).\n\nFile enumerating functions are practically identical.\n\n\n-----\n\n**TTPS**\n\nWe conducted further similarity analysis by analyzing the TTPs of the different variants. We did\n\nthis by extracting the main command lines from all the ransomwares and comparing them. We\n\ndistinguished two distinct clusters:\n\nThe first TTP cluster we identified was WastedLocker. The second TTP cluster contained Hades,\n\nPhoenix and PayloadBIN. From Hades onwards, we found a unique self-delete implementation\n\nincluding the ‘waitfor’ command:\n\n_cmd /c waitfor /t 10 pause /d y & attrib -h_\n\n_“C:\\Users\\Admin\\AppData\\Roaming\\CenterLibrary\\Tip” & del_\n\n_“C:\\Users\\Admin\\AppData\\Roaming\\CenterLibrary\\Tip” & rd_\n\n_“C:\\Users\\Admin\\AppData\\Roaming\\CenterLibrary\\”_\n\n_‘waitfor’ command in Hades, Phoenix Locker and PayloadBIN_\n\nThis command is not present in WastedLocker, where the ‘choice’ command is used instead:\n\n_cmd /c choice /t 10 /d y & attrib -h “C:\\Users\\Admin\\AppData\\Roaming\\Wmi” & del “C:\\Users\\Admin\\_\n\n_AppData\\Roaming\\Wmi”_\n\n_‘choice’ command in WastedLocker_\n\nWhilst syntax difference may seem like a significant difference, these two implementations are\n\nvery similar: the logic is the same, only the signature changes.\n\nAll ransomwares have the same implementation of Shadows copy deletion:\n\n_C:\\Windows\\system32\\vssadmin.exe Delete Shadows /All /Quiet_\n\n_Shadows deletion in WastedLocker Hades, Phoenix Locker, PayloadBIN_\n\nThe evidence of this code reuse supports the assessment that it is almost certain these ransomware\n\nfamilies are related to the same ‘factory’.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe following table summarizes all the ransomware procedures:\n\n\n-----\n\n**CONFIGURATIONS**\n\nThe extraction of static configurations for each variant shows strong similarities. The most\n\nsignificant similarity is that each variant uses the IFSB-inspired static configuration based on a\n\nwhitelisting approach:\n\n\n-----\n\n**CLUSTERING HADES, PHOENIXLOCKER AND PAYLOADBIN**\n\nAnother interesting overlap emerges from the analysis of two unpacked samples belonging to\n\nHades and PhoenixLocker.\n\n**THE .DATA SECTION:**\n\nThe .data section of some Hades samples is identical to those found in PayloadBIN and\n\nPhoenixLocker: .data md5:3fc7f20aabeef2d3290e3b71d7f639fd\n\nFig 16\n\nMoreover, there is a non canonical .obX0 section which is present in the PhoenixLocker payload\n\nand in Hades. Typically, compilers set “standard” names for sections (e.g. “.text” for code, etc..),\n\nthese section names can be modified using different methods i.e. packers. It is also possible to\n\ncreate custom sections and assign custom names to them directly in the code, for example, to\n\nstore encrypted content/payload. The presence of a custom section is particularly uncommon, and\n\nbecomes a very strong marker which permits us to link these variants with little to no ambiguity.\n\n**THE .OBX0 SECTION:**\n\n\n-----\n\n**THE \\\\BASENAMEDOBJECTS\\\\CTFCTF MUTEX:**\n\nThis mutex is present in both the PayloadBIN and Hades variants.\n\n**Sha1**\n\nb4061d4227e08cfaa3190dea9926571fca2736a1 Hades\n\nf8e52380b6f3668d4de6df416c8da389c0d98fe8 Hades\n\nc9b25177db2f6eaddb4b028a9284b4fb5c3ffcd0 Hades\n\n7bcea3fbfcb4c170c57c9050499e1fae40f5d731 Hades\n\ne23637ea81751e558fca17ef1a54b6e39d2e83c3\n\n**THE \\\\BASENAMEDOBJECTS\\\\SCRIPTNET MUTEX:**\n\nThis mutex is present in PhoenixLocker, PayloadBIN and Hades variants.\n\n\n-----\n\nBased on all the findings above, we drew a Venn diagram demonstrating the overlaps between the\n\ndifferent ransomware families, in which we highlight important intersections:\n\nFig 17: The Venn diagram of the overlaps between the ransomware families.\n\nThe same relations are expressed below in the form of a flow graph, in which it is also possible\n\nto decompose the various iterations from one variant to another. The strongest overlaps are\n\nhighlighted in red.\n\nFig 18: The evolution and overlaps between the different ransomware variants\n\n\n-----\n\nFig. 18 clearly identifies the existence of a single cluster which presents very strong code overlap.\n\nTaking a look at the timeline, the different variants were released in a very short time period,\n\ndiffering mostly with simple “cosmetic” changes. From WastedLocker to Hades, however, the time\n\nbetween releases is longer, justifying the effort of having to rewrite the code from scratch. From our\n\nobservation of the timeline, we assess it is highly likely that all the ransomware payloads were\n\n**developed by the same ‘factory’ (developer or group of developers). Moreover, the changes in**\n\nthe code are consistent with the timing between releases.\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\nSentinelLabs assesses that it is highly likely that WastedLocker, Hades, PhoenixLocker and\n\nPayloadBIN belong to the same cluster. Our assessment is based on code similarity and reuse,\n\ntimeline consistency and nearly identical TTPs across the ransomware families indicating there is a\n\nconsistent modus operandi for the cluster. In addition, we assess that there is a likely evolutionary\n\nlink between WastedLocker and BitPaymer, and suggest that it can be attributed to the same EC\n\nactivity cluster.\n\nSentinelLabs assesses, with high confidence, Hades, Phoenix Locker and PayloadBIN variants share\n\nthe same codebase. In addition, we assess it is highly likely that they belong to a common ‘factory’.\n\nWhether Evil Corp outsourced the ransomware development is still an open question. However,\n\nit appears that they tend to maintain control over the whole ransomware development process in\n\norder to reduce the time it takes to make their ransomware operationally active. Keeping control of\n\nthe process allows EC to better manage their operational security during operations. The evidence\n\nof incremental linking, the polymorphism statically introduced (which requires Hades’ codebase),\n\nand the usage of the same version of CryptOne, supports the assessment that it is highly likely a\n\nsingle unique cluster.\n\n\n-----\n\nTracking the threat actor’s tools led us to discover another new, possibly experimental, variant\n\ndubbed “Cypherpunk” - we named it this due to the encryption extension found.\n\n_C:\\Users\\Lucas\\Documents\\OneNote Notebooks\\Personal\\General.one.cypherpunk_\n\n_C:\\Users\\Lucas\\Documents\\awards.xls.cypherpunk_\n\n_C:\\Users\\Lucas\\Desktop\\ZoneMap.dwf.cypherpunk_\n\n_C:\\Users\\Lucas\\Documents\\OneNote Notebooks\\Personal\\CONTACT-TO-DECRYPT.txt_\n\n_C:\\Users\\Administrator\\Searches\\Everywhere.search-ms.cypherpunk_\n\n_C:\\Users\\Lucas\\Desktop\\th (2).jpg.cypherpunk_\n\n_C:\\Users\\Lucas\\Documents\\pexels-photo-46710.jpeg.cypherpunk_\n\n_C:\\Users\\Lucas\\Desktop\\ppt_ch10.ppt.cypherpunk_\n\n_C:\\Users\\Lucas\\Desktop\\WEF_Future_of_Jobs.pdf.cypherpunk_\n\n_Files encrypted with the extension “.cypherpunk”_\n\nCode similarity analysis shows that the Cypherpunk version is the same as the previous PayloadBIN\n\nvariant. It was compiled on 2021-04-01 17:15:24, 20 days after the PayLoadBIN sample. It is\n\npossible that this is another attempt at rebranding.

A Few days later, Sinclair Broadcast\n\n\nGroup systems were also attacked, causing wide disruption\n\n\n29. Some researchers claimed a\n\n\npossible relation with WastedLocker\n\ndetails about this assessment.\n\n\n30, but at the time of writing, no one provided further\n\n\nFig 19: The content of the ransom note used in Macaw\n\nThe ransomware presents anti-analysis features like API hashing and indirect API calls with\n\nthe intention of evading analysis. The only reliable way to reconstruct functions is via dynamic\n\nanalysis by way of fully executing the sample. One aspect that immediately sets Macaw apart\n\nis the fact that it requires a custom token (provided from the command line), which seems\n\n[specific for each victim; without it, it won’t execute (also seen in Egregor and BlackCat):](https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/egregor-raas-continues-the-chaos-with-cobalt-strike-and-rclone/)\n\n_macaw_sample.exe -k <tokeID>_\n\nThis additional requirement also aids in anti-analysis.\n\nAnother new addition to Macaw was a special function that acquires the imports for APIs at\n\nruntime instead of when the executable is started via the PE import section. Below we can see\n\nthe function that is used before each API call, to get the address of it just before the call itself.\n\n28https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/olympus-confirms-us-cyberattack-weeks-after-blackmatter-ransomware-hit-emea-systems/\n\n29 https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/sinclair-tv-stations-crippled-by-weekend-ransomware-attack/\n\n30https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/evil-corp-demands-40-million-in-new-macaw-ransomware-attacks/\n\n\n-----\n\nFig 20: The new function in Macaw which is used to dynamically\n\nfetch addresses for the different external API used by it\n\nThe function gets a 32-bit value that uniquely represents the required API and searches for it\n\nthrough a data structure created beforehand. The data structure can be described as an array\n\nwith small binary search trees in each of its entries.\n\nFig 21: One example of indirect calls used in Macaw just to invoke a call to\nRtlAllocateHeap, calculating the destination address in EAX, exchanging the resulting\n\nvalue with the top of the stack and jumping to it using a “ret” instruction\n\nAt this point we tried to assess the similarity of two core functions (ex: between Hades and\n\nMacaw). In both strains (Hades / Macaw), the implementation is still the same. The only minor\n\ndifferences are from the imports fetched at runtime (so in Hades the color is magenta in the\n\npicture below, because the import is a load time one, specified in the PE import table. and in\n\nMacaw, the color is not magenta, but it still uses the same API, just retrieved at runtime).\n\n\n-----\n\nFig 22: The drive enumeration function in both Hades (left)\n\nand Macaw (right) is partially identical\n\nFig 23: Another example from the beginning of the encryption function\n\nin both Hades (left) and Macaw (right) doing the same operations\n\n\n-----\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\nIt emerges from the analysis of the Evil Corp’s TTPs over time that this threat actor put much of\n\nits effort into defense evasion. Apart from the code overlaps that we found in Macaw, the new\n\nimplementation fully reflects this MO. The signature is sufficiently different to deflect attribution\n\nand avoid simple detection efforts. While the indirect API calls and inserted NOP instructions\n\nare intended to hinder analysis, our investigation reveals that Macaw is derived from the same\n\ncodebase as Hades and other Evil Corp samples.\n\nWe provided a partial assessment of some functionality of the Macaw variant. We found strong\n\noverlaps in the file enumeration and in the encryption routine with Hades, also the same usage of\n\nadding junk code which constitutes a distinctive element.\n\nThis new attempt perfectly fits the observed EC TTPs and is also consistent with the timeline\n\nconsidering that since PayloadBIN, four months have passed and they had all the time to plan\n\na new operation and change the obfuscation. This time it seems that they used VMProtect, so\n\ndespite removing the original signatures (like .vmp0 and .vmp1 PE sections) some features and the\n\nstyle of code seems related to this protector.\n\nBased on our assessment we believe that it is highly likely that this strain is derived from the same\n\ncodebase and belongs to the same EC lineage.\n\n\n-----\n\n### CRYPTONE: THE PACKER\n\nCryptOne (also known as HellowinPacker) is a special packer in use by Evil Corp up till mid-2021.\n\n\nCryptOne appears to have first been noticed in 2015\n\n\n31. Early versions were used by an assortment\n\n\nof different malware families such as Gozi, Dridex, and Zloader. In 2019, Bromium\n\n\n32 analyzed and\n\n\nreported it as in use by Emotet. In June 2020, NCC Group\n\n\n33 reported that CryptOne was used to\n\n\npack WastedLocker. In 2021, researchers\n\na-Service on hacker forums.\n\n\n34 observed CryptOne being advertised as a Packer-as\n\nCryptOne has the following characteristics and features:\n\n   - **Sandbox evasion with getInputState() or GetKeyState() API;**\n\n   - **Anti-emulation with UCOMIEnumConnections and the**\n\nIActiveScriptParseProcedure32 interface;\n\n   - **Code-flow obfuscation;**\n\nIn order to assist our research, we created a static unpacker we dub “de-CryptOne”\n\n\n35. This unpacker\n\n\nis capable of statically unpacking both x86 and x64 samples. It outputs two files: 1) the shellcode\n\nresponsible for unpacking 2) the unpacked sample. We collected CryptOne packed samples, and\n\nwith the use of the above tool, unpacked and categorized them at scale.\n\n31https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2015/12/malware-crypters-the-deceptive-first-layer/\n\n32https://www.bromium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Bromium-Emotet-Technical-Analysis-Report.pdf\n\n33https://blog.fox-it.com/2020/06/23/wastedlocker-a-new-ransomware-variant-developed-by-the-evil-corp-group/\n\n34https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/analytics/pt-esc-threat-intelligence/paas-or-how-hackers-evade-antivirus-software/\n\n35https://github.com/Tera0017/de-CryptOne\n\n\n-----\n\n**A UNIQUE FACTORY**\n\nHunting for CryptOne led us to identify different versions of this cryptor, which have never been\n\nreported previously. Each version is identified by a certain signature, listed below:\n\n  - 111111111\\\\{aa5b6a80-b834-11d0-932f-00a0c90dcaa9}\n\n  - 1nterfacE\\\\{b196b287-bab4-101a-b69c-00aa00341d07}\n\n  - 444erfacE\\\\{b196b287-bab4-101a-b69c-00aa00341d07}\n\n  - 555erfacE\\\\{b196b287-bab4-101a-b69c-00aa00341d07}\n\n  - 5nterfacE\\\\{b196b287-bab4-101a-b69c-00aa00341d07}\n\n  - 987erfacE\\\\{b196b287-bab4-101a-b69c-00aa00341d07}\n\n  - Interfac4\\\\{b196b287-bab4-101a-b69c-00aa00341d07}\n\n  - InterfacE\\\\{b196b287-bab4-101a-b69c-00aa00341d07}\n\n  - aaaerfacE\\\\{b196b287-bab4-101a-b69c-00aa00341d07}\n\n  - interfacE\\\\{b196b287-bab4-101a-b69c-00aa00341d07}\n\n  - rrrerfacE\\\\{b196b287-bab4-101a-b69c-00aa00341d07}\n\nThe first part of the string is composed of a custom string (111111111, 1nterfacE, 444erfacE, ...)\n\nwhich then is replaced at runtime by the ‘interface’ keyword, creating the following registry key:\n\n_HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\interface\\{b196b287-bab4-101a-b69c-00aa00341d07}_\n\n_HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\interface\\{aa5b6a80-b834-11d0-932f-00a0c90dcaa9}_\n\nThose registry keys are related to the UCOMIEnumConnections and IActiveScriptParseProcedure32\n\ninterfaces respectively. Once executed, the Cryptor checks for the presence of those keys before\n\nloading the next stage payload. If it does not find the keys, then the malware goes in an endless\n\nloop without doing anything as an anti-emulation technique. This works because some emulators\n\ndo not implement the full Windows registry.\n\nIn reviewing two different versions of CryptOne:\n\n**aaerfacE\\\\{b196b287-bab4-101a-b69c-00aa00341d07} and**\n\n**111111111\\\\{aa5b6a80-b834-11d0-932f-00a0c90dcaa9}, we noticed that in order to update**\n\nthe signature, the actor needs to re-compile the cryptor as the cryptor implementation changes.\n\n\n-----\n\nFig 25: aaaerfacE\\\\{b196b287-bab4-101a-b69c-00aa00341d07} implementation\n\nFig 26: 111111111\\\\{aa5b6a80-b834-11d0-932f-00a0c90dcaa9} implementation\n\n**TEMPORAL ANALYSIS**\n\nCompilation timestamps are not trustworthy by nature because they can easily be altered. We\n\ncannot confirm if they were altered or not but we have made some assumptions based on our\n\nobservations which we detail below.\n\nPlease note: those observations are based on a small number of samples, collected and validated.\n\n\n-----\n\n**OBSERVATION #1 - SEQUENTIAL CONSISTENCY:**\n\nThe first observation is that for all the packed artifacts we collected, we noticed a gap between\n\nthe compilation time and packing time (with CryptOne). The two operations are sequential and\n\nhappened at two different moments in time:\n\n\n-----\n\nOf note, the packing timestamp is always later than the payload timestamp. This observation\n\nled us to conclude that even if the compilation timestamp of the real payload was altered\n\n(voluntarily or not), it is consistent with the logical order of events.\n\n**OBSERVATION #2 - CONSISTENCY WITH THE TIMING OF THE OPERATIONS:**\n\nThe second observation comes from the timing of the operations. The timestamps of the packed\n\nartifacts fall inside the timeframe of the operations. This means that, even if the timestamp was\n\naltered in some way, we can assume it is trustworthy because it is consistent with the timeline of\n\noperations and permits us to place events in chronological order.\n\nPlease note: We define the start and end dates for each period of activity broadly, based primarily\n\non OSINT and the publicly reported dates of incidents.\n\n**Family Name** **Start of the Operations** **End of the Operations**\n\n**WastedLocker** May 202036 July 202037\n\n**Hades** Dec 202038 March 202139 40\n\n**PhoenixLocker** 2021-03-26 March 2021\n\n**PayloadBin** 2021-06-0341 2021-06-0342\n\nWe correlated the above information with the different CryptOne signature timestamps.\n\nThis forms an important observable for our analysis and allows us to construct a more\n\nreliable timeline.\n\n36https://research.nccgroup.com/2020/06/23/wastedlocker-a-new-ransomware-variant-developed-by-the-evil-corp-group/\n\n37https://www.vmray.com/cyber-security-blog/wastedlocker-ransomware-threat-bulletin/\n\n38ttps://awakesecurity.com/blog/incident-response-hades-ransomware-gang-or-hafnium/\n\n39https://www.accenture.com/us-en/blogs/security/ransomware-hades\n\n40https://www.accenture.com/us-en/blogs/cyber-defense/unknown-threat-group-using-hades-ransomware\n\n41based on VT submission date\n\n42based on VT submission date\n\n\n-----\n\n**OBSERVATION #3 - STATISTICAL AND CHRONOLOGICAL CONSISTENCY**\n\nAnother observation comes from the relation between the packing time and VT ‘first seen’ field.\n\nThe VT ‘first submission’ tells us the timestamp in which a given sample was submitted.

In the following table, the\n\nvarious CryptOne versions, with their associated malware and inherent time-frame are\n\nsummarized (from the oldest to the most recent):\n\n\n-----\n\n**INTERESTING OBSERVATIONS**\n\nThere are some interesting congruences that come from the observation of this timeline.\n\nNetwalker started to use the service on 12/10/2019 and remained a customer until the second\n\nversion (March/April 2020). There is a realistic possibility that EC started being a customer of\n\nthe CryptOne service from 3/1/2020. In fact, within the timeframe 3/1/2020 - 6/5/2020 we\n\nfound WastedLocker, gozi_rm3(version:3.00 build:854) and Dridex(10121) samples were all\n\npacked and compiled in the same timeframe using the same CryptOne signature (InterfacE).\n\n**CryptOne** **Associated Malware** **# of** **Timeframe of utilization**\n\n**Architecture**\n\n**version** **families packed** **samples** **(taken from the packing ts)**\n\ngozi_rm3(version:3.00\n\nInterfacE build:854), Dridex(10121), 366 3/1/2020 - 6/5/2020 x86\n\nWastedLocker, Netwalker\n\nAnother interesting coincidence is that, from December 2020, the CryptOne version ‘111111111’\n\nappeared in the wild without any overlap.

It is considered to be one of the ‘more problematic topics in\n\nthe threat intelligence community. The documented ties with the Russian FSB, the US indictments\n\nand the OFAC sanctions are probably the main reasons behind such controversy. Clustering EC\n\nactivity is demonstrably difficult considering that the group has changed TTPs several times in\n\norder to bypass sanctions and stay under the radar. In this research we connect the dots in the EC\n\necosystem, cluster malware, document EC’ activities and provide insight into their TTPs.\n\nFirst, we assess it is almost certain that EC’s ransomware variants were all developed by the same\n\n‘factory’, as there is significant code reuse between all the ransomware variants. Our temporal\n\nanalysis demonstrated that all the operations are tightly connected and synchronized; we assess\n\nit is almost certain there is a single entity which owns the entire attack chain, from resource\n\ndevelopment to ransomware deployment. Whether the group operates a RaaS model for a trusted\n\nnumber of affiliates is still an open question.\n\nEC’s TTPs demonstrate their advanced capability to adapt and persist in victim environments. From\n\nthe ransomware perspective, they implemented specific techniques to evade EDR and lower detection.\n\nThe partial rewrite in native API and the custom implementation of polymorphism - relying on the\n\ninsertion of a wide range of no-op-codes in Hades malware - are clear elements of their capability, not\n\ncommonly found in the cybercrime threat landscape. From a detection standpoint, it would be fruitful\n\nto improve detection of defense evasion TTPs in order to reduce blind spots.\n\nFrom a strategic standpoint, EC poses a serious threat to organizations due to their capabilities: the\n\nability to maintain a high level of operational security, to evade detection, and last but not least the\n\nability to ‘change their skin’ (ransomware signature, TTPs) in a very short period of time. All these\n\nelements provide a solid understanding of the modus operandi of this group and their capabilities. The\n\nadoption of SocGholish as an initial access tool and Koadic as a fileless post exploitation framework,\n\nfurther demonstrates how this cluster relies on uncommon tools to stay undetected.Victimology\n\nremains an open point due to the lack of shared intelligence. This is also a side effect of the OFAC\n\nsanctions, which presents unique challenges for incident response firms involved in such cases. Public\n\nattribution to EC is a sensitive matter for the aforementioned reasons. Moreover, EC’s operators have\n\nadopted victim anonymity since the deployment of Hades ransomware, removing victim information\n\nfrom the ransom note. This lowers the chances of organizations being discovered if they have fallen\n\nvictim to EC.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe alleged ties with the Russian government, the low volume of operations, the high level of\n\noperational security place this threat actor in a somewhat unique, hybrid position between espionage\n\nand cybercrime. This hybrid position is exemplified by the lacklustre monetization strategy of the\n\ngroup, suggesting motives that go beyond financial gain. The group’s main motivations present\n\nthe most important open question for the intelligence community. Some speculations claim EC is\n\nconducting espionage, masquerading as financial crime through extortion. Some speculate that EC\n\nreceives portions of a Russian black budget to finance activities that cannot directly link back to State\n\nactivity. Nevertheless, continued research on the group needs to continue to elicit the motivations of\n\nthe threat group.\n\nHistorically, EC presents two distinct modus operandi: botnet operation to conduct mass spam\n\ncampaigns primarily through Dridex (and derivatives); and since 2017, Big Game Hunting in low\nvolume ransomware operations using BitPaymer. These 2 distinct tactics they have practiced over time\n\ndemonstrate the level of sophistication and adaptability of this actor, a relatively unique characteristic\n\nof a cybercrime threat actor.\n\nWe cannot be certain of exactly how EC will continue to evolve and target organizations. However,\n\nwe assess it is likely they will continue to advance their tradecraft, finding new methods of evading\n\ndetection and misleading attribution. SentinelLabs will continue tracking this activity cluster to provide\n\ninsight into their evolution.\n\n\n-----\n\n### MITRE ATT&CK TTPS OBSERVED\n\n**Tactic**\n\nT1584.004 - Compromise\nResource Development\nInfrastructure: Server\n\nInitial Access\n\nExecution\nInstrumentation\n\nT1059.001 - Command\n\nExecution\n\nPowerShell 53\n\nExecution T1106 - Native API\n\nPrivilege escalation\n\nUser Account Control\n\n50https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1584/004/\n\n51https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1189/\n\n52https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047/\n\n53https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0119/\n\n54https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1106/\n\n55https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/002/\n\n\n-----\n\n**Tactic** **Technique** **Procedure/Comments**\n\n\n56https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/001/\n\n57https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/001/dri\n\n58https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/004/\n\n59https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/001/\n\n60https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1218/\n\n61https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1497/001/\n\n62https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/002/\n\n63https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/005/\n\n\n-----\n\n**Tactic** **Technique** **Procedure/Comments**\n\n\n64https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564/\n\n65https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1553/002/\n\n66https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1480/\n\n67https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/005/\n\n68https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1558/003/\n\n69https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1087/002/\n\n70https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1482/\n\n\n-----\n\n**Tactic** **Technique** **Procedure/Comments**\n\n\n71https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1069/002/\n\n72https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1083/\n\n73https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1135/\n\n74https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1087/001/\n\n75https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1105/\n\n76https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1486/\n\n\n-----\n\n|CryptOne:generic|rule CryptOne { meta: Author = \"@Tera0017/@SentinelOne\" Family = \"Evil Corp Packer-CryptOne\" strings: $x86_code1 = {68 FC 4A 06 00 68 F4 E0 01 00 E8} $x86_code2 = {6A 15 E8 [4] 83 C4 04 A3 [4] 68 45 7E 00 00} $x86_code3 = {83 C4 08 8B 55 ??

CryptOne unpacking](https://github.com/SentineLabs/Crypt1_IOCs)\n\nmethod consists of two stages:\n\n1. Decrypts and executes embedded shellcode.\n\n2. Shellcode decrypts and executes embedded executables.\n\nCryptOne gets chunks of the encrypted data, which are separated by junk.\n\nFig 31\n\nExample Memory Dump:\n\n   - **0x5EE00, Encrypted size.**\n\n   - **0x4011CA, Address of encrypted data**\n\n   - **0x4D/”M”, Junk data**\n\n   - **0x14, Junk size**\n\n   - **0x7A, Chunk Size**\n\nAfter removal of the junk data,, the decryption starts with a simple XOR-Key which increases\n\nby 0x4 in each round. The initial XOR-Key is 0xA113.\n\n\n-----\n\nFig 32\n\nOnce the shellcode is decrypted, we can slightly observe the string _“This program cannot be_\n\n_run in DOS mode” where this data contains an executable which requires a second decryption._\n\nFig 33\n\nSimilar to previous decryption, this time the shellcode decrypts the embedded binary.\n\nFig 34\n\n\n-----\n\nThe shellcode allocates and copies the encrypted executable and starts the decryption loop,\n\nonce it finishes, jumps to the EntryPoint and executes the unpacked sample.\n\nFig 35\n\nAt this stage we can observe strings related to the unpacked sample.\n\nFig 36\n\n\n-----\n\n## ABOUT SENTINELLABS\n\nInfoSec works on a rapid iterative cycle where new discoveries occur daily and authoritative\nsources are easily drowned in the noise of partial information.
