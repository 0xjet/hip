Once the document is clicked, it drops a heavily\nobfuscated JS file (JavaScript) that downloads Trickbot as its payload. This malware also checks for the\n\n\nGo to…\n\n\n-----\n\nenvironment.\n\nAside from its information theft capabilities, it also deletes files located in removable and network drives that\nhave particular extensions, after which the files are replaced with a copy of the malware. Based on our\ntelemetry, this Trickbot campaign has affected the United States the most. It has also distributed spam to\nChina, Canada, and India.\n\n_Figure 1. Infection chain_\n\nIn a sample email, the spam purports to be a subscription notification involving advertising providers, even\ntelling the user that it submitted an application for a three-year subscription and settled a sum of money with\nthe sender. The mail then explains that several more fees will be charged to the user’s card in the coming\ntransactions. It ends by prompting the user to see the attached document for all the settlement and\nsubscription information. The document in question contains the malicious script.\n\nThe distributed Word document presents the user with the following notification (see Figure 2) that states the\ncontent can be viewed by enabling macro content. It’s worth noting that the document hides the JS script in\nthe document itself and not in the macro. It does this by disguising the script through the same font color as\nthe document background.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2. Document asking users to enable macro_\n\nThe script is obfuscated and contains different functions. In order to decrypt a function, it will use another\nfunction that will convert it to a single character.\n\n_Figure 3. Function for decryption_\n\nUpon successfully deobfuscating the file, we were able to analyze it and observed some interesting behaviors.\nUpon execution, it will display a fake Microsoft error to trick the user with an error message that pops up\nafter enabling the macro. But actually, the JS file is already running in the background.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4. Fake Microsoft error_\n\nFor persistence, the malware creates a copy of itself into the Startup folder as Shell.jse. The JS file also\nchecks for running processes — what’s particularly notable is the malware’s anti-analysis or evasion\ncharacteristic, which checks for the total number of all the running processes in the victim’s machine, which\nmeans it will not proceed with its execution if there are not enough processes running.\n\nIf the running processes are under 1,400 characters (length of the string), the malware assumes it to be an\nindicator that it is running in a virtual or sandbox environment. It will also check for the existence of\nprocesses usually used for analysis. Aside from these, the malware inspects if the environment it runs in\nrelates to specific usernames.\n\n_Figure 5. A snippet of checked processes and usernames_\n\n_Figure 6. Code error shown if anything matches the check_\n\n\n-----\n\nAgentSimulator.exe\nB.exe\nBehaviorDumper\nBennyDB.exe\nctfmon.exe\nDFLocker64\nFrzState2k\ngemu – ga.exe\niexplore.exe\nImmunityDebugger\nLOGSystem.Agent.Service.exe\nlordPE.exe\nProcessHacker\nprocexp\nProcmon\nPROCMON\nProxifier.exe\ntcpdump\nVBoxService\nVBoxTray.exe\nvmtoolsd\nvmware\nVzService.exe\nwindanr.exe\nWireshark\n\nUpon further analysis, we’ve also compiled the usernames the malware checks for based on the following\nstrings:\n\nEmily\nHAPUBWS\nHong Lee\nJohnson\nmilozs\nPeter Wilson\nSystemIT | admin\nVmRemoteGuest\nWIN7 – TRAPS\n\nFor the malware’s payload, it will connect to the URL hxxps://185[.]159[.]82[.]15/hollyhole/c644[.]php then\nchecks for the file to be downloaded. If it is an executable file, it will save the file to %Temp% as\n_{random}.exe and execute it afterwards. If the file is not an executable, it will then save it as {random}.cro in_\nthe same folder. The .cro file will then be decoded using certutil.exe, saved as {random}.exe in the same\ndirectory, and executed. Upon further research, we discovered that the downloaded .exe file is a variant of the\nTrickbot malware.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7. The file is saved, random names get generated, and .cro is decoded using certutil.exe_\n\nAside from stealing system information such as OS, CPU, and memory information; user accounts; installed\nprograms and services; IP configuration; and network information (configuration, users, and domain settings),\nthis Trickbot variant also gathers the following credentials and information from applications and internet\nbrowsers.\n\n\nApplication credentials\n\nFilezilla\nMicrosoft Outlook\nPuTTy\nRemote Desktop (RDP)\nVNC\nWinSCP\n\n\nBrowser credentials and information (Google Chrome,\nInternet Explorer, Microsoft Edge, and Mozilla\nFirefox)\n\nAutofills\nBilling info data\nBrowsing history\nCredit card data\nHTTP POST responses\nInternet cookies\nUsernames and passwords\n\n\nThis malware also uses a point-of-sale (PoS) extraction module called psfin32, which identifies PoS-related\nterms located in the domain of interest. The [module uses LDAP queries to search for PoS information on](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/trickbots-bigger-bag-of-tricks/)\nmachines with the following substrings:\n\n*ALOHA*\n*BOH*\n*CASH*\n*LANE*\n*MICROS*\n*POS*\n*REG*\n*RETAIL*\n*STORE*\n*TERM*\n\nThe variant also appears to drop shadnewdll, a proxy module that intercepts and modifies web traffic on an\naffected device to create fraudulent bank transactions over the network. Additionally, according to security\nresearcher Brad Duncan, the module [shares similarities with the banking trojan IcedID, which redirects](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/trickbot-trojan-gets-icedid-proxy-module-to-steal-banking-info/)\nvictims to fake online banking sites or attaches to a browser process to inject fake content in phishing\nschemes.\n\nIn such cases where the malware fails to connect it will search for files with the following extensions in the\n\n\n-----\n\n.xls\n.pdf\n.rtf\n.txt\n.pub\n.odt\n.ods\n.odp\n.odm\n.odc\n.odb\n\nFiles with the aforementioned extensions will be saved in the %Temp% folder as ascii.txt. The said files will\nall then be deleted and replaced with a copy of the malware and the extension .jse (but is actually a JS file).\n\n_Figure 8. Scanning for files and replacing it with a copy of itself_\n\n### Defending Against Trickbot: Trend Micro Recommendations and Solutions\n\nInformation-stealing malware Trickbot has become a cybercriminal mainstay for infecting machines and\ncompromising emails, and has been used to [reportedly steal more than 250 million accounts. This new](https://www.engadget.com/2019/07/12/trickbot-malware-trickbooster-250-million-email-accounts/)\ndevelopment shows how cybercriminals can constantly tweak an existing banking trojan to add new\ncapabilities. Users, however, can prevent these attacks by simply following [best practices against spam.](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/ph/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/infosec-guide-email-threats)\nAside from awareness of the telltale signs of a spam email such as suspicious sender address and glaring\ngrammatical errors, we also recommend that users refrain from opening email attachments from unverified\nsources.\n\nUsers and enterprises can also benefit from protection that uses a multilayered approach against risks brought\nby threats like Trickbot. We recommend employing [endpoint application control that reduces attack exposure](http://www.trendmicro.com/us/enterprise/product-security/endpoint-application-control/)\nby ensuring only files, documents, and updates associated with whitelisted applications and sites can be\n[installed, downloaded, and viewed.
