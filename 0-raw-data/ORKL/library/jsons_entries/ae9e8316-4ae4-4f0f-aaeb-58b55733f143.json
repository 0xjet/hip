These exploits allowed the threat actors to](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/qnap-removes-backdoor-account-in-nas-backup-disaster-recovery-app/)\nremotely execute the 7zip archival utility to password protect all the files on victims' NAS\n\n\n-----\n\nstorage devices.\n\nUsing such a simple approach allowed them to encrypt over a thousand, if not thousands,\nof devices in just five days using a time-tested encryption algorithm built into the 7zip\narchive utility.\n\n## Ransom demands were priced correctly\n\nEnterprise-targeting ransomware usually demands ransom payments ranging from\n[$100,000 to $50 million to decrypt all of a victim's devices and not leak their stolen data.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/computer-giant-acer-hit-by-50-million-ransomware-attack/)\n\nHowever, Qlocker chose a different target - consumers and small-to-medium business\nowners utilizing QNAP NAS devices for network storage.\n\nIt seems that the threat actors knew their targets well as they priced their ransom demands\nat only 0.01 Bitcoins, or at today's Bitcoin prices, approximately $500.\n\n**Qlocker ransom demand**\n\n\n-----\n\nDeciding to pay millions of dollars requires a company to think hard about whether the lost\ndata is worth millions of dollars.\n\nHowever, paying $500 can be seen as a small price to pay to recover important files, no\nmatter how violated a victim may feel.\n\nQlocker's decision appears to have paid off as the payments have started to rush in earning\nthe threat actors a sizeable return for a few days of activity.\n\n## Qlocker made almost $260,000 so far\n\nAs the Qlocker ransomware uses a fixed set of Bitcoin addresses that victims are rotated\nthrough, it has been possible for BleepingComputer to collect the addresses and monitor\ntheir payments.\n\n[Tuesday night, security researcher Jack Cable discovered a short-lived bug that allowed](https://twitter.com/jackhcable/status/1385112173974745091)\nhim to recover the passwords for 55 victims passwords for free. While utilizing this bug, he\ncollected ten different Bitcoin addresses that the threat actors were rotating with victims and\nshared them with BleepingComputer.\n\nSince then, BleepingComputer has collected an additional 10 addresses, for a total of\n20 bitcoin addresses used by the Qlocker threat actors.\n\nAt this time, the 20 bitcoin addresses, shown below, have received ransom payments\ntotaling 5.25735623 Bitcoins. This amount is equivalent to approximately $258,494.\n\n**Bitcoin Address** **Total Bitcoin

approximately 525 victims\nhaving paid the ransom so far.\n\nUnfortunately, the ransoms keep coming in as users make the hard decision of paying to\nrecover their files, so this number will likely increase through the weekend and into next\nweek.\n\nThis ransomware campaign is still ongoing, with new victims appearing every day.\nTherefore, all QNAP users must update the latest versions of the Multimedia Console,\nMedia Streaming Add-on, and Hybrid Backup Sync apps to fix the vulnerabilities and\nprotect against these ransomware attacks.\n\n[Users are also advised to secure their NAS devices so that other future attacks are harder](https://www.qnap.com/en/how-to/faq/article/what-is-the-best-practice-for-enhancing-nas-security)\nto accomplish.\n\n[For more information, you can read
