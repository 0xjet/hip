    "plain_text": "# Trickbot Expands Global Targets Beyond Banks and Payment Processors to CRMs\n\n**[f5.com/labs/articles/threat-intelligence/malware/trickbot-expands-global-targets-beyond-banks-and-payment-processors-to-crms](https://f5.com/labs/articles/threat-intelligence/malware/trickbot-expands-global-targets-beyond-banks-and-payment-processors-to-crms)**\n\nbyline August 1, 2017\n\nThe financial trojan TrickBot has been updating its campaigns and targets since F5 malware researchers started\nfollowing it in September 2016. This is expected behavior because attackers need to continually update their\ntargets and methods to evade detection. Previously, [TrickBot, the successor to Dyre, targeted financial institutions](https://f5.com/content/f5-labs/en/labs/articles/threat-intelligence/little-trickbot-growing-up-new-campaign-24412.html)\nin [Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. TrickBot’s May 2017 campaigns targeted banks in the UK,](https://f5.com/content/f5-labs/en/labs/articles/threat-intelligence/trickbot-now-targeting-german-banking-group-sparkassen-finanzgruppe-24420.html)\nAustralia, US, Canada, New Zealand, Ireland, France, Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Bulgaria, India,\nSingapore, and Hong Kong.\n\nIn the 26 TrickBot configurations F5 researchers analyzed that were active in May 2017, targets expanded beyond\nbanks to include two payment processing providers and two Customer Relationship Management (CRM) SaaS\nproviders. The fact that [payment processors were targets was a notable change that we also observed in Marcher,](https://f5.com/content/f5-labs/en/labs/articles/threat-intelligence/marcher-gets-close-to-users-by-targeting-mobile-banking-android-apps-social-media-and-email-26004.html)\nan Android banking trojan in March of 2017. It appears now that CRMs are a new target of attackers; is it because\nof their potential for collecting valuable user data that could enhance phishing campaigns?\n\nWhat’s also notable (and expected) is that all command and control (C&C) servers tied to the most recent\ncampaigns reside within web hosting provider networks and were communicating with their infected hosts over port\n443. We know attackers hide their exploits in encrypted traffic; this is just another point of reference to prove it is a\nconsistent and common method being used. Additionally, none of the C&Cs we observed in May 2017 were the\nsame C&Cs we tracked in late 2016.\n\n**May 2017 Campaigns**\n\nThis analysis focuses on the activities of two separate campaigns of different sizes identified in the 26\nconfigurations analyzed, versions “1000018” and “1000019.” The smaller campaign detected included 210 URL\ntargets focused on banks in Australia, UK, Canada, New Zealand, Singapore, India, and Ireland, and a payment\n\n\n-----\n\nprocessor in the US. The larger campaign detected included 257 URLs for banks in the UK, Australia, US, Canada,\nIreland, France, Germany, Switzerland, Hong Kong, the Netherlands, and Bulgaria. The same US payment\nprocessor was targeted across both campaigns, however, the CRM targets only appeared in the second campaign.\n\nFigure 1: Smaller campaign and larger campaign with count of URL targets\n\n_Figure 1: Smaller campaign and larger campaign with count of URL targets_\n\n**TrickBot May Targets by Industry and Country**\n\nWhen looking at TrickBot’s URL targets, we attributed the country target based on the country code in the URL\n[rather than the global headquarters of the targeted business. For instance, https://www.citibank.com.sg is attributed](https://www.citibank.com.sg/portal/bluehome/index.htm)\n[to Singapore, and https://online.citi.eu/GBIPB is attributed to the UK, even though CitiBank is headquartered in the](https://online.citi.eu/GBIPB/JPS/portal/Index.do?JFP_TOKEN=0T6C8HO2)\nUS. (Refer to Appendix A for specific targets by country.)\n\nThe smaller campaign focused on targeting banks (83% of URL targets) in Australia, UK, Canada, New Zealand\nand Singapore, and a payment processor (PayPal) attributed to the US (although PayPal users are global).\n\nFigure 2: URL targets by industry in the smaller campaign\n\n_Figure 2: URL targets by industry in the smaller campaign_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe map in Figure 3 shows the number of URLs targeted by country in the smaller campaign. All targets in every\ncountry except the US were banks. No US banks were targeted in this campaign, only the payment processor,\nPayPal. The 35 unique PayPal URLs targeted were the exact same URLs targeted in both campaigns.\n\nFigure 3: Targeted Countries in the smaller campaign\n\n_Figure 3: Targeted Countries in the smaller campaign_\n\nFigure 4 shows unique URLs targeted in comparison to unique businesses, because there were often multiple URL\ntargets within one business. (For additional details on the businesses targeted by industry and country, see\nAppendix A.)\n\nFigure 4 shows unique URLs targeted in comparison to unique businesses, because there were often multiple URL\ntargets within one business.

The specific CRMs targeted were\nSalesforce.com and an auto sales CRM developed by Reynolds & Reynolds in the US.\n\nFigure 5: URL targets by industry in the larger campaign\n\n_Figure 5: URL targets by industry in the larger campaign_\n\nThe larger campaign was mainly focused on banks in the UK (47% of targets, up from 18% in the smaller\ncampaign), followed by Australia, then the US. All Australian targets were banks again. PayPal was the leading US\ntarget (exactly the same PayPal URLs in both campaigns), followed by 9 other US banks that were not targeted in\nthe smaller campaign, and with the addition of new CRM providers. Additional European companies were targeted\nin the larger campaign, including banks in France, Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and Bulgaria. A bank in\nHong Kong was the new Asia target in this campaign, however, the banking targets in Singapore and India from the\nsmaller campaign were not included.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6: Targeted countries in the larger campaign\n\n_Figure 6: Targeted countries in the larger campaign_\n\nThe chart below shows the same data as that shown in Figure 4 for the larger campaign.

As shown in the table below, three of the six are operated by hosting firms in Asia that\nuse these European web hosting companies’ services. All of them used port 443 / HTTPS as a connection method\nfrom the infected machine back to the C&C host, a method commonly used by malware authors to evade detection\nfrom network security devices that don’t inspect encrypted traffic.\n\nC&C IP Address Network Name ASN Country Industry Hosting City Country\nCustomer\n\n149.202.30.126 OVH AS16276 France Web MAXSERVER Hanoi Vietnam\nHosting CO.\nProvider\n\n151.80.84.1 OVH AS16276 France Web Premium Bandung Indonesia\nHosting Cheap\nProvider Hosting\n\n195.133.196.129 RUCLOUD AS48347 Russia Web JSC Moscow Russia\nHosting Mediasoft\nProvider ekspert\n\n37.1.205.43 INFERNO-NL-DE AS50673 Netherlands Web 3NT Hosting London UK\nHosting Network\nProvider\n\n88.99.246.23 Hetzner Online AS24940 Germany Web MAXSERVER Hanoi Vietnam\nGmbH Hosting CO.\n\nProvider\n\n91.247.36.15 FRIENDHOSTING AS59729 Bulgaria Web — — —\nHosting\nProvider\n\n**Samples Analyzed**\n\nThe following MD5 samples, active in May 2017, were analyzed for this report:\n\na21c6369738446afa16bf5e70da6ccfa\n8bf6ee81794c965f38484c0570718971\nb4195cf20d59be307a4d7125d51150b7\nad8783a32b43f8fa50c5279b712255dc\n143b01d3edc77ed82c5e5a4ae4d92b5a\n5376a68fe2e9899515b4ea0e531f4d4d\n645a229bfa994e79286537ea8f0c9381\n7a3ecbf2fefa5c329d9d659cbbf7a58d\nd4a2a049fe6c23cb1a2e19f804eb4ba8\n2073224eda2e5e6bd9e782d6be4d28cb\n830ebf2cefb1f6bad8587978b252d0b7\n45160aa23d640f8d1bcb263c179f84f9\n9d166a822439a47eb2dfad1aeb823638\na9bdbd097b9757c23d5600ecfb0e8b45\nddf408ce7c4b5df1a57a3ca45197f18e\nd5aa87b9f44575c00d6bc803ac31f18b\n8cb0af444e90da3b0d9de00e7db0f4f7\nfe2d9595a96046e441e43f72deac8cb0\n14ffdcecdd3c6056460cc622fef3b061\n1082f5c74019f2122bade2dac71f693f\n\n|C&C IP Address|Network Name|ASN|Country|Industry|Hosting Customer|City|Country|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|149.202.30.126|OVH|AS16276|France|Web Hosting Provider|MAXSERVER CO.|Hanoi|Vietnam|\n|151.80.84.1|OVH|AS16276|France|Web Hosting Provider|Premium Cheap Hosting|Bandung|Indonesia|\n|195.133.196.129|RUCLOUD|AS48347|Russia|Web Hosting Provider|JSC Mediasoft ekspert|Moscow|Russia|\n|37.1.205.43|INFERNO-NL-DE|AS50673|Netherlands|Web Hosting Provider|3NT Hosting Network|London|UK|\n|88.99.246.23|Hetzner Online GmbH|AS24940|Germany|Web Hosting Provider|MAXSERVER CO.|Hanoi|Vietnam|\n|91.247.36.15|FRIENDHOSTING|AS59729|Bulgaria|Web Hosting Provider|—|—|—|\n\n\n-----\n\n5a137c1dd4a55c06531bdbfeaf15c894\n18056207edc1a3384c2c84531fa2817c\n1d004f708748b4ce5aa095fd5a42e0ce\neb7d15c945324529e28e72ad76f387a4\n3ec07fee718360ad1f1a450f7aaa19db\n1d3a3922bdcea3a6bca3c8b2f4b40e48\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIt seems the success of TrickBot thus far has influenced the authors to not only repeat their previous target list of\nbanks from previous campaigns but to expand those targets to include new banks globally as well as CRM\nproviders. The fact that C&C servers in these two most recent campaigns reside within web hosting companies is\nalso significant, along with the fact that the C&C servers were different from those used in previous campaigns.\nGiven the changes we’ve witnessed with each successive campaign, F5 Labs researchers expect to see further\nevolution in both the targets and methods used by TrickBot authors, and we will continue to monitor and report on\nthis evolving threat. TrickBot’s consistent initial attack pattern is to use email spam campaigns, so users are\nadvised not to open suspicious files received by email.\n\n**Appendix A**\n\nThe following list shows the actual banks targeted by country, and the number of unique URLs per bank as an\nindication of their importance to the malware authors.\n\n|Bank (By Country)|URLs Targeted Smaller Campaign|URLs Targeted Larger Campaign|\n|---|---|---|\n|Australia|||\n|Adelaide Bank|1||\n|AMP Bank|1||\n|Arab Bank Australia|1||\n|Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd|8|5|\n|Bank of Melbourne|4|3|\n|Bank of Queensland|2||\n|Bank of South Australia|4|3|\n|Bank of Sydney|1||\n|Bankwest|1||\n|Bendigo Bank|1||\n|Beyond Bank|1||\n|Commonwealth Bank of Australia|13|12|\n|Credit Union Australia|1||\n|Defence Bank|1||\n|Greater Bank|1||\n|HSBC Bank|1||\n\n\n-----\n\n|Hume Bank|1|Col3|\n|---|---|---|\n|IMB Bank|1||\n|Macquarie|2||\n|Members Equity Bank|1||\n|MyState Bank|1||\n|National Australia Bank Limited|6|3|\n|Newcastle Permanent|1||\n|QT Mutual Bank|1||\n|Rabobank|2||\n|Rural Bank|1||\n|St. George Bank|4|3|\n|State Bank of India (AU site)|1||\n|Suncorp Metway Limited|10|9|\n|Teachers Mutual Bank|1||\n|TSWG|1||\n|Westpac Banking Corporation|16|14|\n|Bulgaria|||\n|UniCredit Bulbank||1|\n|Canada|||\n|Bank of Montreal|7|6|\n|Banque Nationale du Canada||1|\n|Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce|1||\n|Peace Hills Trust||1|\n|Royal Bank of Canada|4|4|\n|Scotiabank|2|1|\n|TD Canada Trust|4|3|\n|France|||\n|BNP Paribas||1|\n|Societe Generale||1|\n|Germany|||\n|Deutsche Bank||2|\n|Hong Kong|||\n\n\nHSBC Bank 1\n\n\n-----\n\n|India|Col2|Col3|\n|---|---|---|\n|ICICI Bank|1||\n|State Bank of India|1||\n|Ireland|||\n|Allied Irish Banks||2|\n|Bank of Ireland||2|\n|EBS||1|\n|Ireland Bank||1|\n|Open24||1|\n|Ulster Bank|2|2|\n|Netherlands|||\n|ING||1|\n|New Zealand|||\n|ASB Bank|1||\n|Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd|2||\n|Bank of New Zealand|1||\n|Heartland Bank|1||\n|HSBC Bank|1||\n|Kiwi Bank|1||\n|Rabobank|2||\n|SBS Bank|1||\n|Westpac Banking Corporation|2||\n|Singapore|||\n|CIMB Bank|1||\n|Citibank|2||\n|DBS Bank|2||\n|HSBC Bank|1||\n|Maybank|1||\n|OCBC Bank|2||\n|Standard Chartered|1||\n|United Overseas Bank|2||\n|Switzerland|||\n\n\n-----\n\n|Julius Baer|Col2|1|\n|---|---|---|\n|UBS||1|\n|UK|||\n|Adam and Company||1|\n|Airdrie Savings Bank||1|\n|AJ Bell||1|\n|Al Rayan Bank||1|\n|Aldermore Bank||1|\n|Arbuthnot Latham||1|\n|Bank Leumi|1|1|\n|Bank of Cyprus||1|\n|Bank of Scotland|3|4|\n|Barclays Bank|3|7|\n|Buckinghamshire Building Society||1|\n|Butterfield Bank||1|\n|C.
