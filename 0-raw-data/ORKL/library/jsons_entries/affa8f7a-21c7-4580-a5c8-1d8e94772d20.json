    "plain_text": "# Threat of the Month: IcedID Malware\n\n**[ceriumnetworks.com/threat-of-the-month-icedid-malware/](https://ceriumnetworks.com/threat-of-the-month-icedid-malware/)**\n\n## About Threat of the Month Series\n\n\nJuly 29, 2021\n\n\n**With the rise of cyberattacks, it’s impossible for security and IT teams to keep track of**\n**every one. We’ll identify an emerging cybersecurity threat and give information on**\n**what it is, why it’s becoming more prevalent, and how you can prevent it.**\n\n**The Threat of the Month blog series is a** **collaboration between Cerium Networks and**\n**Blumira.**\n\nThis month’s threat is IcedID (aka BokBot) a strain of malware that initially operated as a\nbanking trojan but has now evolved into something far more dangerous: an initial access\nbroker for ransomware threat actors.\n\nThe first half of 2021 alone has been a record-breaking time period for ransomware, during\nwhich six ransomware groups have compromised 292 organizations, according to an\neSentire report. The report estimates that these attacks generated at least $45 million for the\ngroups.\n\nSo, what does IcedID have to do with ransomware? The threat actors that are deploying\nransomware aren’t usually the ones deploying IcedID in the wild.\n\nThe threat actors behind IcedID typically launch a mass email campaign. Once IcedID has\ngained a foothold into an environment, the malware threat actors sell that initial access —\nwhich often includes reconnaissance intel such as the number of endpoints in the targeted\norganization, network range, and potential access points — in a cybercriminal marketplace.\nRansomware-as-a-service affiliates will purchase the initial access which they use to launch\nthe ransomware attack.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Learn more about the differences between malware and ransomware >](https://www.blumira.com/ransomware-vs-malware/)\n\nThe evolution of IcedID from a banking trojan to an initial access broker means that financial\n[institutions are no longer the only target. Any organization that doesn’t have malware](https://www.blumira.com/use-cases/ransomware-prevention-detection/)\nprevention in place can be a potential victim.\n\n## How Does IcedID Work?\n\nThreat actors have used a few different methods to deploy an IcedID campaign, and as with\nmost cyberattacks, these methods are always evolving — making IcedID more difficult to\ndetect.\n\nIn some campaigns, threat actors use rigged Excel spreadsheets as a delivery mechanism.\nThreat actors typically use a naming convention that prompts victims to open it, using\nlanguage such as “refusal,” “claim,” and “overdue.” Users that open the file will see a screen\ninstructing them to enable macros to see the full version.\n\nOnce macros are enabled, the malicious formula embedded in the Excel sheet will execute.\nMalware developers often use white font on a white background to make the formula\ninvisible to victims. Macros on the sheet then download three DLL files with the .dat\nextension from the command and control servers.\n\nMore recent IcedID campaigns involve threat actors using contact forms on legitimate\ncompany websites to send emails with malicious links. With this method, the emails that\narrive in a victim’s inbox look trustworthy because they are sent using email marketing\nsystems. It’s possible that threat actors have used tools to automate the process and evade\nCAPTCHA measures, according to Microsoft.\n\nIn one particular campaign, the email contained strong language and legal threats about\nstolen photography, with links to site.google.com for the recipient to view the stolen photos.\nOnce a victim follows the link, which asks them to sign in with Google credentials, the site\nwill automatically download a zip file. This contains a malicious .js file that launches the\nIcedID attack.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Why Now?\n\nIn January 2021, a coalition of eight international law enforcement officials brought down one\n[of the most widespread malware variants, Emotet. On April 25, 2021, government officials](https://www.blumira.com/glossary/emotet-malware/)\nuninstalled Emotet from all infected systems. Like IcedID, Emotet originated as a banking\ntrojan designed to steal sensitive information. Over the years, however, it morphed into a\n\n\n-----\n\nmore sophisticated strain of malware that evaded detection techniques and used command\nand control servers to receive updates. It eventually became capable of downloading\n[secondary malware payloads, such as “Ryuk” ransomware.](https://www.blumira.com/detect-prevent-ransomware-attacks/)\n\n[The takedown of arguably one of the biggest players in malware created an opening in the](https://www.blumira.com/emotet-malware/)\nmarketplace for cybercriminals to fill — and IcedID is primed to take its place.\n\nIcedID isn’t the only initial access broker for ransomware gangs; other malware families such\nas TrickBot and Qbot also deliver payloads for ransomware attacks. However, IcedID threat\nactors have managed to fly under the radar, while strains like TrickBot are heavily monitored\nby law enforcement.\n\nA few signs have pointed to the rise of IcedID and its use within ransomware attacks. Threat\nresearchers reported a spike in IcedID activity in March 2021. IcedID was also used to\ndeliver Sodinokibi, MAZE and Egregor ransomware attacks.\n\n## How To Prevent IcedID\n\nOrganizations can do a few things to prevent IcedID. Deploying antivirus (AV) software may\nseem like an obvious first step. Although more advanced solutions can be helpful, IcedID\nuses sophisticated techniques like using a company’s contact forms to evade detection from\nmany traditional antivirus tools.\n\n**Deploy detection and response. A detection and response solution that alerts security and**\nIT teams about suspicious behaviors is typically more effective in preventing sophisticated\n[malware strains like IcedID than an antivirus software. Blumira, for example, comes with](https://www.blumira.com/)\nprebuilt detections designed to detect behaviors that are associated with IcedID’s initial\naccess attack path — like running built-in Windows utilities or enabling macros.\n\n**Train employees to detect phishing. Nearly every IcedID campaign starts with a phishing**\nemail, so employees that are able to detect these emails can prevent an IcedID attack\naltogether. Security teams can educate employees about phishing in a few ways depending\non company culture, such as interactive quizzes, team meetings and casual discussions.\n\n**Disable macros. IcedID uses macros to download and execute its payload, so one step that**\nIT and security admins can take is to [disable macros for Microsoft Word through GPO, as](https://4sysops.com/archives/restricting-or-blocking-office-2016-2019-macros-with-group-policy/)\nthis will have little to no business impact for most organizations. Enforcing any kind of macro\npolicy for Excel, while recommended, will require more aggressive planning.\n\n## Try Blumira For Free\n\nNot only does Blumira’s threat detection and response solution come with prebuilt detections\ndesigned to detect and alert you on suspicious behaviors, but it also comes with a team of\nreal security advisors to help you remediate an issue and take next steps.\n\n\n-----\n\nDeploying Blumira takes a matter of hours, not months or weeks.
