    "plain_text": "# SpyEye Botnet’s Bogus Billing Feature\n\n**[krebsonsecurity.com/2010/09/spyeye-botnets-bogus-billing-feature/](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2010/09/spyeye-botnets-bogus-billing-feature/)**\n\nMiscreants who control large groupings of hacked PCs or “botnets” are always looking for\nways to better monetize their crime machines, and competition among rival bot developers is\nleading to devious innovations. The SpyEye botnet kit, for example, now not only allows\nbotnet owners to automate the extraction of credit card and other financial data from infected\nsystems, but it also can be configured to use those credentials to generate bogus sales at\nonline stores set up by the botmaster.\n\nAs I noted in [a post in April, SpyEye is a software package that promises to make running a](http://krebsonsecurity.com/2010/04/spyeye-vs-zeus-rivalry/)\nbotnet a point-and-click exercise. A unique component of SpyEye is a feature called\n“billinghammer,” which automates the purchase of worthless or copycat software using credit\ncard data stolen from victims of the botnet.\n\nThe SpyEye author explained this feature in detail on several hacking forums where his kit is\nsold, even including a video that walks customers through the process of setting it up.\nBasically, the scam works like this: The botmaster acquires some freeware utility or\nlegitimate program, renames it, claims it as his own and places it up for sale at one of\n\n\n-----\n\nseveral pre-selected software sales and\n[distribution platforms, including ClickBank,](http://www.clickbank.com/)\n[FastSpring,](http://www.fastspring.com/) [eSellerate,](http://www.esellerate.net/) [SetSystems, or](http://www.setsystems.com/) [Shareit.](http://www.shareit.com/)\nThe botmaster then logs in to his SpyEye\ncontrol panel (picture above), feeds it a list of\ncredit card numbers and corresponding\ncardholder data, after which SpyEye opens an\nInternet Explorer Window and — at user-defined\nintervals — starts auto-filling the proper fields at\nthe botmaster’s online store and making\npurchases.\n\nThe billinghammer module also is set up to\nevade anti-fraud controls at the online software\nstores, by funneling each transaction through a\nSpyEye-infected system whose Internet\naddress traces back to a geographic location\nthat approximates the cardholder’s street\naddresss.\n\nIn the video that shows how to use this portion\nof the bot kit, it appears that SpyEye customers\nhave the option either to make sales at their\nown stores, or to use some that are apparently\nset up by the author of the bot kit himself.\n\nIn an e-mail to KrebsOnSecurity.com,\nFastSpring’s chief customer service officer Ken\nWhite said: “We understand what this system tries to do, and how the bad guys attempt to\nuse it to convert stolen cards into cash. We haven’t yet been exploited successfully and\nbelieve we have a good system in place to prevent it.”\n\nAll other software sales and distribution systems coded into the SpyEye bot kit are entities\noperated by Digital River, which did not respond to repeated requests for comment. It’s not\nclear how many — if any — SpyEye customers are using the billinghammer plug-in. But\nassuming that there are some scammers out there abusing these services through SpyEye,\nit seems that it would be a great way to catch botmasters in the act. After all, the check or\nwire transfer for any bogus software sales has to be sent somewhere.\n\n\n-----",
