Additional targets were also mentioned](https://www.cyberscoop.com/shadow-brokers-nsa-documents-reveal-sweeping-espionage-operation-middle-eastern-banks/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[one week prior in a separate archive that was largely ignored by most media outlets.](https://www.cyberscoop.com/shadow-brokers-linux-nsa-donald-trump-syria/)\n\n[Yet the document cache published April 8 provides evidence that the NSA had once](https://medium.com/@shadowbrokerss/dont-forget-your-base-867d304a94b1)\nlaunched a series of successful computer-based intrusions against multiple high-profile\nforeign targets, including the Office of the President of Iran and the Russian Federal Nuclear\nCenter, said two former intelligence officials who spoke to CyberScoop on the condition of\nanonymity due to their knowledge of internal operations. That release contained files with\nearmarked organizations and other evidence that explains how certain cyberattacks were\nengineered.\n\n“The fact that this is in there the way it is means these targets were definitely owned,” one\nformer intelligence official said. “It means it was a successful op, plain and simple.”\n\nAnother former intelligence official that worked at the NSA and also spoke on condition of\nanonymity said the April 8 document dump offered authentic internal information regarding\npast agency operations.\n\n[While the Shadow Brokers published a list of 300 IP addresses last October that were](https://www.myhackerhouse.com/hacker-halloween-inside-shadow-brokers-leak/)\nsupposedly once compromised by the spy agency, it was not until recently that researchers\nwere provided with more comprehensive targeting data.\n\nAn analysis of [one archive presented by the Shadow Brokers reveals a collage of web](https://github.com/x0rz/EQGRP/tree/master/archive_files)\ndomains and hardware systems that were at one point targeted by the NSA and attacked\nwith a suite of hacking tools. These domains include:\n\n[dolat.ir: Islamic Republic of Iran Presidential Office website](https://github.com/x0rz/EQGRP/blob/master/archive_files/stoicctrls/stoicctrls/stoicsurgeon_ctrl__v__1.6.12.6_x86-linux-optimusprime-vezarat.dolat.ir)\n[vniitf.ru: Russian Federal Nuclear Center website](http://vniitf.ru/)\nmail.prf.gov.ru: a mail server for the Presidential Administration of Russia (aprf.gov.ru is\nno longer online)\n[vega-int.ru: a website for Russian internet service provider, Vega-Internet](http://vega-int.ru/)\n[snz.ru: a website for the office providing telecommunications and other internet support](http://snz.ru/)\nfor Vniitf.ru\n[minatom.ru: a website of the Ministry for Atomic Energy of the Russian Federation](http://minatom.ru/)\n[udprf.ru: the Office of the President of the Russian Federation website](http://udprf.ru/)\n[rowdaco.com: a defunct website once apparently used by a Somalia-based electronics](http://www.bizearch.com/company/Rowda_Electronics_Company_274156.htm)\nstore, Rowda Electronics Company\n[ikoula.com: a website for a French data storage and server rental company](http://ikoula.com/)\n\nA closer look at the full filenames in the archive provides additional insight. The websites\nthemselves represent targeted host machines, or boxes, each of which is paired with two\ndifferent codenames— one for the hacking tool used and another for the associated\noperation.\n\nFor example, one such file name is listed as:\n\n\n-----\n\n_stoicsurgeon_ctrl__v__1.5.33.2_x86-linux-optimusprime-vezarat.dolat.ir_\n\nIn this context, the term “stoicsurgeon” is a reference to the codename of the deployed tool.\n“Optimusprime” is the title of an NSA operation. “v__1.5.33.2” details the version of\nstoicsurgeon, a rootkit backdoor aimed at Linux’s MultiArch — which helps install library\npackages from multiple architectures on the same machine.\n\nExperts say stoicsurgeon is a post-exploitation tool, meaning that a different exploit was\nnecessary to first compromise the target. “Ctrl” in the sample is the name of the loader. “x86Linux” refers to the 32-bit Linux operating system used by the target in this case. “Vezarat,” a\nterm referring to Iran’s Ministry of Intelligence, is the host box in the dolat.ir domain that was\nspecifically compromised.\n\nIt all translates to an NSA operation that likely saw U.S. spies hack into a host box inside a\ncomputer network that was of high interest to national security analysts in Washington during\n[the Obama administration. According to an internal PowerPoint presentation previously](https://edwardsnowden.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/media-35675.pdf)\nleaked by former agency contractor Edward Snowden, “Optimusprime” is related to the\nNSA’s SPINALTAP project, a program that was introduced to combine data from active\noperations and passive signals intelligence.\n\nStoicsurgeon is just one hacking tool used against the web domains listed above. Another\ntool, codenamed “suctionchar,” also features prominently in the archive filename list — for\nexample: suctionchar_agent__v__2.0.27.18_x86-linux-tilttop-comet.vniitf.ru.\n\n[Security researcher x0rz described “suctionchar” as a “32 or 64 bit OS, solaris sparc 8,9,](https://github.com/x0rz/EQGRP)\nKernel level implant” that provide an attacker with “transparent, sustained, or realtime\ninterception of processes input/output vnode traffic,” that can also “intercept ssh, telnet,\nrlogin, rsh, password, login, [and] csh” data.\n\n\n-----",
