Executive Summary\n\nThis report describes a campaign of targeted spyware attacks carried out by a sophisticated operator,\nwhich we call Stealth Falcon. The attacks have been conducted from 2012 until the present, against\nEmirati journalists, activists, and dissidents. We discovered this campaign when an individual purporting\nto be from an apparently fictitious organization called “The Right to Fight” contacted Rori Donaghy.\nDonaghy, a UK-based journalist and founder of the Emirates Center for Human Rights, received a\nspyware-laden email in November 2015, purporting to offer him a position on a human rights panel.\nDonaghy has written critically of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) government in the past,1 and had\nrecently published a series of articles based on leaked emails involving members of the UAE\ngovernment.2\n\n\nCircumstantial evidence suggests a link between Stealth Falcon and the UAE government. We traced\ndigital artifacts used in this campaign to links sent from an activist’s Twitter account in December 2012, a\nperiod when it appears to have been under government control. We also identified other bait content\nemployed by this threat actor. We found 31 public tweets sent by Stealth Falcon, 30 of which were\ndirectly targeted at one of 27 victims. Of the 27 targets, 24 were obviously linked to the UAE, based on\ntheir profile information (e.g., photos, “UAE” in account name, location), and at least six targets appeared\nto be operated by people who were arrested, sought for arrest, or convicted in absentia by the UAE\ngovernment, in relation to their Twitter activity.\n\nThe attack on Donaghy — and the Twitter attacks — involved a malicious URL shortening site. When a\nuser clicks on a URL shortened by Stealth Falcon operators, the site profiles the software on a user’s\ncomputer, perhaps for future exploitation, before redirecting the user to a benign website containing bait\ncontent. We queried the URL shortener with every possible short URL, and identified 402 instances of\nbait content which we believe were sent by Stealth Falcon, 73% of which obviously referenced UAE\nissues. Of these URLs, only the one sent to Donaghy definitively contained spyware. However, we were\nable to trace the spyware Donaghy received to a network of 67 active command and control (C2) servers,\nsuggesting broader use of the spyware, perhaps by the same or other operators.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 1: Tag cloud of bait content topics used by Stealth Falcon showing a strong emphasis on_**\n**_political topics and narratives critical of the UAE government_**\n\n## 2. Background\n\nRori Donaghy3 is a London-based journalist who currently works for UK news organization Middle East\n_Eye, a website that covers news in the Middle East.4_ _Middle East Eye has recently published a series of_\narticles about UAE foreign policy, based on leaked emails involving members of the UAE government.\nPreviously, Donaghy led the Emirates Center for Human Rights,5 an organization he founded to\n_“promote the defence of human rights in the United Arab Emirates … through building strong_\n_relationships with the media, parliaments and other relevant organisations outside the UAE”.6_\n\n\n### 2.1. Political and Human Rights Situation in the UAE\n\nIn its most recent (2015) Freedom in the World ranking, Freedom House classified the UAE as “not free,”\nand noted that the UAE continues to “suppress dissent”. 7 Human Rights Watch stated in its most recent\n(2016) country report, that the UAE has “continued … to arbitrarily detain and in some cases forcibly\n_disappear individuals who criticized the authorities”.8_ Amnesty International says that UAE courts have\n_“accepted evidence allegedly obtained through torture”.9_\n\n\nSpecifically in the online realm, there is evidence that the UAE government has previously conducted\nmalware attacks against civil society. At least three dissidents10 including a journalist, and UAE human\nrights activist Ahmed Mansoor, were targeted in 2012 with Hacking Team spyware11 by a Hacking Team\ncustomer in the UAE, apparently operating under the auspices of the office of Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed\nal-Nahyan,12 a son of the founder of the UAE, and now the UAE Deputy National Security Advisor.13 The\nUAE client had a license from Hacking Team to concurrently infect and monitor 1100 devices.14\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 2: Diagram of Stealth Falcon’s known Targets, Fake Personas, and campaign Artefacts,_**\n**_along with relevant sections of the report. The document paints a picture of a large-scale_**\n**_campaign with a focus on critics of the UAE Government_**\n\n## 3. The November 2015 Attack: An “Invitation”\n\n_This section describes an email attack against journalist Rori Donaghy. The operators used a Microsoft_\n_Word macro that installs a custom backdoor allowing operators to execute arbitrary commands on a_\n_compromised machine._\n\n### 3.1 Initial Attack Email\n\nIn November 2015, the journalist Donaghy received the following email message, purportedly offering\nhim a position on a panel of human rights experts:\n\n**From:** [the_right_to_fight@openmailbox.org](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:the_right_to_fight@openmailbox.org)\n\n**Subject: Current Situation of Human Rights in the Middle EastMr. Donaghy,We are currently organizing a**\npanel of experts on Human Rights in the Middle East.\nWe would like to formally invite you to apply to be a member of the panel by responding to this email.\n\nYou should include your thoughts and opinions in response to the following article about what more David\nCameron can be doing to help aid the Middle East.\n\n\n-----\n\n**http://aax.me/d0dde**\nThank you.\n\nWe look forward to hearing back from you,\n\nHuman Rights: The Right to Fight\n\nDonaghy was suspicious of the email, and forwarded it to us for analysis. We found that the link in the\nemail (http://aax.me/d0dde) loaded a page containing a redirect to the website of Al Jazeera. Before\ncompleting the redirect, it invoked JavaScript to profile the target’s computer. We describe the profiling in\ndetail in Section 3.1-3.3 below.\n\n### 3.2 Communication with the Operator\n\nOn our instruction, Donaghy responded to the email, asking for further information. The operators\nresponded with the following message:\n\n**From:** [the_right_to_fight@openmailbox.org](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:the_right_to_fight@openmailbox.org)\n\n**Subject: RE: Current Situation of Human Rights in the Middle EastMr. Donaghy,Thank you for getting**\nback to us. We are very interested in you joining our panel.\nThe information you requested is in the attached document.\n\nIn order to protect the content of the attachment we had to add macro enabled security.\n\nPlease enable macros in order to read the provided information about our organization.\n\nWe hope you will consider joining us.\n\nThank you.\n\nWe look forward to hearing back from you,\n\nHuman Rights: The Right to Fight\n\nBy chance, the attachment was identified as malicious and blocked by a program running in Donaghy’s\nemail account. We instructed him to follow up and request that the operators forward the attachment via\nanother method. Donaghy received the following reply:\n\n**From:** [the_right_to_fight@openmailbox.org](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:the_right_to_fight@openmailbox.org)\n\n**Subject: RE: Current Situation of Human Rights in the Middle EastMr. Donaghy,We apologize for having**\nproblems with our attachment.\nPlease follow this link to download our organizational information.\n\n**http://aax.me/a6faa**\n\nThe link has been password protected. The password is: right2fight\n\nIn order to protect the content of the attachment we also had to add macro enabled security.\n\nPlease enable macros in order to read the provided information about our organization.\n\nWe hope you will consider joining us.\n\nThank you.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe look forward to hearing back from you,\n\nHuman Rights: The Right to Fight\n\nThis second link (http://aax.me/a6faa) redirects to the following URL using an HTTP 302 redirect:\n\n**https://cloud.openmailbox.org/index.php/s/ujDNWMmg8pdG3AL/authenticate**\n\nThis is a password-protected link to a file shared on an ownCloud15 instance. We obtained this file, and\nfound it to be a Microsoft Word document.\n\n### 3.3 The Malicious Document\n\nThe document is:\n```\nFilename: right2fight.docm\nMD5:    80e8ef78b9e28015cde4205aaa65da97\nSHA1:   f25466e4820404c817eaf75818b7177891735886\nSHA256:  5a372b45285fe6f3df3ba277ee2de55d4a30fc8ef05de729cf464103632db40f\n\n```\n\nWhen opened, the target is greeted with the following image, purporting to be a message from\n“proofpoint,” a legitimate provider of security solutions for Office 365.16 The image claims that “This\n_Document Is Secured” and requests that the user “Please enable macros to continue.”_\n\n**_Figure 3: Fake Proofpoint image in the malicious document sent to Donaghy_**\n\nIf the target enables macros, they are presented with the following document:\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 4: Document that Donaghy would have seen, had he enabled macros_**\n\nThe document purports to be from an organization called “The Right To Fight,” and asks the target\nDonaghy to open the link in the original email he received (the email containing the profiling URL). We\nbelieve that “The Right To Fight” is a fictitious organization, as their logo appears to be copied from an\nexhibition about “African American Experiences in WWII”.17 Further, “The Right to Fight” has no\ndiscernable web presence.\n\n**_Figure 5: Logo from exhibition about African American experiences in WWII._**\n\n**3.3.1 Profiling**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe document attempts to execute code on the recipient s computer, using a macro. The macro passes\na Base64-encoded command to Windows PowerShell, which gathers system information via Windows\nManagement Instrumentation (WMI), and attempts to determine the installed version of .NET by querying\n[the registry (full script available in Appendix A: Stage One PowerShell Command).](https://citizenlab.ca/2016/05/stealth-falcon-appendices/)\n\n**3.3.2 Communication & Obtaining a Shell**\n\nGathered information is returned to http://adhostingcache.com/ehhe/eh4g4/adcache.txt, and the\nserver’s response is executed as a PowerShell command. At the time, adhostingcache.com resolved\nto 95.215.44.37. The domain was apparently deleted on November 30th 2015 (Donaghy received the\nmalicious Word Document on November 24th 2015). A new domain, adhostingcaches.com, was\nregistered on December 3rd, which points to the same IP address. The deletion of\n**adhostingcache.com may reflect operator suspicion that the file received by Donaghy had been sent to**\nsecurity researchers.\n\nThe server response is a PowerShell command that decodes and materializes an invocation of a\nBase64-encoded PowerShell command to disk as IEWebCache.vbs, and creates a scheduled task\nentitled “IE Web Cache” that executes the file hourly (full script available in Appendix B: Stage Two\n**PowerShell Command).**\n\n**IEWebCache.vbs runs a Base64-encoded PowerShell command, which periodically POSTs a unique**\nidentifier to https://incapsulawebcache.com/cache/cache.nfo (via HTTPS without verifying the server\ncertificate, and with a hardcoded user-agent header matching Internet Explorer 10.6). The script\nexecutes server responses as PowerShell commands, responding back to the server with the exit status\nof, output of, or any exceptions generated by the commands.\n\nThis gives the operator control over the victim’s computer, and allows the operator to install additional\nspyware or perform other activities. All commands and responses are encrypted using RC4 with a\nhardcoded key, and the encrypted message is prefixed with a hardcoded value.\n\nDespite some similarities in functionality to the Empire backdoor,18 we were unable to identify any shared\ncode, and we suspect that the backdoor is custom-made.\n\n### 3.4. Technical Analysis: aax.me Browser Profiling\n\n_While aax.me has a public interface where anyone may shorten a link, aax.me only conducts browser_\n_profiling of individuals who click on links that are specially shortened by Stealth Falcon operators._\n\nIn November 2015, when we accessed the link in the second email that Donaghy received,\n**http://aax.me/a6faa, we found that it redirected directly to**\n**https://cloud.openmailbox.org/index.php/s/ujDNWMmg8pdG3AL/authenticate via an HTTP 302**\nredirect. When we accessed the link in the first email that Donaghy received, http://aax.me/d0dde, the\nserver responded with the following page:\n```\n<iframe src='redirect.php' height='1' width='1' border='0' scrolling='no' frameborder='0'\nunselectable='yes' marginheight='0' marginwidth='0' onload='setTimeout(\"document.location\n=\\\"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2015/11/british-pm-middle-east-human-rights151103070038237.html\\\"\", 20000)'></iframe><br><br><br><center><img src='loading.gif'><br>Loading\nthe website:<br><b>http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2015/11/british-pm-middle-east-humanrights-151103070038237.html</b>.<br>This may take a few seconds.</center>\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nThe page is apparently designed to redirect to an Al Jazeera op-ed after twenty seconds. However, the\nURL is incorrect: the last character of the filename should be a “1” instead of a “7”. Therefore, an Al\n_Jazeera 404 page is returned instead of the op-ed. It is possible that the use of “7” instead of “1”_\nrepresents a transcription error on the part of the operators. When we accessed this same aax.me URL\nin March 2016, it redirected directly to the Al Jazeera URL (with typo) via an HTTP 302 redirect.\n\nThe iframe, http://aax.me/redirect.php, reloads itself with a parameter “inFr” in its query string, to\nindicate whether the page has been opened up inside a frame.\n```\n<html><body><script type=\"text/javascript\">if(window!=window.top)\n{inFr=\"1\"}else{inFr=\"0\"}document.location=document.location+\"?inFr=\"+inFr;</script><noscript><img\nsrc=\"?jSc=0\"/></noscript></body></html>\n\n```\nIf the page has not been opened up inside a frame (inFr=0), then a blank page is returned. If the page is\nopened inside a frame (inFr=1), as is the case here, then the following page is returned (we ommitted the\nPHPSESSID value):\n```\n<html><head></head><body><div id='display' height='1' style='display:none;'></div><form\nid='statsPost' action='?stats=1' method='POST'><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"PHPSESSID\" value=\"\" />\n<input id='theData' name='theData' type='hidden' value='' /></form><script type='text/javascript'\nsrc='redirect.js'></script></body></html>\n\n```\nWe examined the referenced JavaScript file, http://aax.me/redirect.js. The file is designed to profile a\nuser’s system, perhaps to gather intelligence about potentially exploitable vulnerabilities. The file has\napparently not been updated since 7 May 2013,20 rendering some of the probing obsolete. We enclose\n[the file’s full contents in Appendix C: JavaScript Profiling File. The profiling performs the following](https://citizenlab.ca/2016/05/stealth-falcon-appendices/)\nactions:\n\n\nFor Internet Explorer, it attempts to create several instances of ActiveXObject to get the versions of\nFlash, Shockwave, Java, RealPlayer, Windows Media Player, and Microsoft Office (classified as\neither 2003, 2007, or 2010).\nFor non-Internet Explorer browsers, it attempts to get a list of enabled plugins from\nnavigator.mimeTypes.\nFor all browsers, it captures the user agent, whether cookies are enabled, the OS, the size of the\nbrowser window, and the timezone. It classifies browsers into different versions, denoted by letters,\nbased on the existence and behavior of certain JavaScript methods.\nThe script attempts to exploit an information leak in older versions of Tor Browser. We explore the\ntechnique used in Section 3.5.\nFor Windows browsers (except Opera, and versions of Internet Explorer before IE9), it sends a\nseries of XMLHttpRequests to 127.0.0.1, which we believe are designed to deduce if the computer\nis running any one of several specific antivirus programs. The code for this appears to be borrowed\nfrom the JS-Recon port scanning tool.21 The creator of JS-Recon presented the tool at BlackHat\nAbu Dhabi in 2010.22 We explore such techniques in more detail in Section 3.6.\n\nWe were unfamiliar with the website aax.me, so we investigated it further. We found that the main page\nof aax.me purported to be a public URL shortening service, powered by YOURLS,23 an open source\nPHP framework allowing anyone to set up their own URL shortening service. We are unable to ascertain\nwhether the site actually uses any YOURLS code. We also noted that the homepage contains a typo\n(“Shortend [sic] URL”).\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 6: Homepage of aax.me_**\n\nWe shortened a URL using the homepage, but found that clicking on the shortened URL did not trigger\nthe loading of the intermediate page, http://aax.me/redirect.php. We also did not find the code for\n**redirect.php or redirect.js in the public code repository for YOURLS.24** Thus, we deduced that this\ncode was likely specially written by the operators, and the link sent to Donaghy was likely created by\nsomeone with administrator access to aax.me.\n\n### 3.5. Technical Analysis: aax.me Tor Deanonymization Attempt\n\n_The aax.me site appears to attempt to deanonymize users of Tor Browser. While the technique the_\n_operators used was out-of-date at the time we observed the attack, the attempted Tor deanonymization_\n_speaks to their motivations and potential targets._\n\n\nThe script first detects Tor Browsers by checking whether navigator.buildID is set to zero (all testing was\nconducted on English, Windows builds of Tor Browser). Versions of Tor Browser before 2.3.25-12\n(released on 13 August 2013) had their buildID set to zero. This behavior was originally introduced in\nTorButton,25 in support of the goal of making Tor users appear homogenous.26 Current Tor Browser\nversions have navigator.buildID set to a different distinctive value, 20000101000000.\n\nWhen the script detects a Tor Browser, it attempts to deduce the version of Tor Browser by checking for\nthe existence and behavior of certain JavaScript methods. Once a browser is determined to be older\nthan a certain version of Tor Browser, the script exploits a now-fixed bug to get the disk path of the\nbrowser installation.27 The disk path may contain the target’s username, which may include the target’s\nreal name.\n\n\nThe bug in Tor Browser was first disclosed at Defcon 17, which took place in August 2009.28 The bug\nwas first fixed on on 25 May 2012 in Tor Browser release 2.2.35-13.29 The bug was, however, later\nreintroduced into Tor Browser on 18 December 2013 with the release of Tor Browser 3.5, and\nsubsequently fixed again in Tor Browser 3.6 on 29 April 2014.30 However, unfortunately for the\noperators, they failed to update their profiling script to reflect Tor Browser’s navigator.buildID change\n(before the bug was reintroduced). Thus, the profiling script did not detect Tor Browsers with the\nreintroduced bug as Tor Browsers, so it did not try to exploit them. Even if it had been updated to reflect\nthe navigator.buildID change, the version check in the Tor Browser exploitation code would also have to\nbe updated to select the versions with the reintroduced bug for exploitation.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe version of Tor Browser (as determined by JavaScript checks) is submitted back to the server, along\nwith the value of navigator.oscpu (which reveals the version of the OS on which Tor Browser is running —\ne.g., the latest version of Tor Browser on OSX El Capitan reveals: “Intel Mac OS X 10.11”) which is set to\n“Windows NT 6.1” in the latest Tor browser, navigator.vendor (which appears blank in the latest Tor\nBrowser), and any data gathered about the installation path.\n\n### 3.6. Technical Analysis: aax.me Antivirus Profiling\n\n_Interestingly, aax.me also attempts to determine the presence of various antivirus products on a target’s_\n_machine._\n\nWe expand on the probing of antivirus programs which we observed on aax.me, as we were unfamiliar\nwith this technique. The technique appears to work on any modern version of Windows, with the latest\nversions of Chrome, Firefox, and IE/Edge (though, the profiling script excludes IE versions less than IE9\nfrom the profiling, using the vertical tab test).31 Specifically, the script conducts GET XMLHttpRequests\n(one at a time) to 127.0.0.1/ on the following ports: 12993, 44080, 24961, 1110, 6646, 6999, 30606. The\nscript stops conducting these requests if it finds one request whose readyState is set to 4 less than\n20ms after the request was initiated (200ms for port 6646), and submits the number of this port to the\nserver.\n\n\nThe latest versions of Internet Explorer/Edge, Chrome, and Firefox (except Tor Browser) will all perform\nthese XMLHttpRequests to 127.0.0.1 on behalf of any site. Of course, the result of such a request will\nmost likely not be available to the script, due to the same-origin policy, and likely absence of a CORS32\nheader in the response. Indeed, the script does not attempt to read the results of its requests. Rather, it\nleverages the fact that the web browser makes the status of the request sent available, via the\n**readyState parameter of an XMLHttpRequest instance (1 approximately represents TCP SYN sent, and**\n_4 represents HTTP response received or TCP connection terminated). For a closed port, Windows will_\nissue an RST/ACK for each SYN sent. However, it appears that Windows’ TCP stack will not consider an\noutgoing connection it is initiating to be terminated until it has sent 3 SYNs, and received three\ncorresponding RST/ACKs (or timeouts).\n\n**_Figure 7: Three RST/ACKs required until Windows considers outgoing TCP connection_**\n**_terminated_**\n\nWhen testing with a TCP connection from Windows to a remote host, we can clearly see that Windows\ntransmits the second SYN ~500ms after the first RST/ACK, and the third SYN ~500ms after the second\nRST/ACK.\n\n**_Figure 8: Windows sends the next SYN 500ms after the latest RST/ACK_**\n\n\n-----\n\nThus, the readyState value for a request to a closed port on 127.0.0.1 will not be set equal to 4 until\napproximately 1000ms after the request is issued. In summary, one can use this technique to distinguish\nbetween a closed port (readyState set to 4 at around 1000ms), an open port (readyState set to 4 before\n1000ms), and a filtered port (readyState set to 4 long after 1000ms).\n\nThis script was apparently designed to detect the presence of certain components of Avast, Avira, ESET,\nKaspersky, and Trend Micro antivirus products. We were not able to determine which program the\nprobing of port 24961 was designed to detect. We verified that the latest version of Avast can be\ndetected by this script, as it opens TCP port 12993, which is associated with its Mail Shield component\nfor scanning email traffic; port 6999 is opened by Trend Micro’s tmproxy33 which scans web and email\ntraffic; port 1110 is used by Kaspersky34 to scan web and email traffic; it appears that Avira’s Web\n_Protection component for scanning web traffic used to open port 44080,35_ though we observed it opening\n44081 instead; port 30606 appears to have been used by ESET to scan web and email traffic,36 but we\ndid not observe this port open while testing the latest version of ESET; port 6646 may be used by\nMcAfee, though we did not test this.37\n\n\nThe code for the port scanning appears to be adapted from the JS-Recon port scanning tool.38 JSRecon is a generic tool that enumerates all open ports on 127.0.0.1 in a range; it does not specifically\ntarget anti-virus programs. The scan_xhr and check_ps_xhr functions in the aax.me profiling script are\nsimilar to the scan_ports_xhr and check_ps_xhr functions in JS-Recon. The creator of JS-Recon\nseems to have first presented the tool at BlackHat Abu Dhabi in 2010.39\n\n**_Figure 9: Image from the author of JS-Recon showing how long WebSocket and XMLHttpRequest_**\n**_(“COR”) connections remain in their initial readyState on Windows.40_**\n\nNote that this technique can be generalized to any remote content timing side channel (e.g, the onerror\nevent for an Image). Additionally, one can identify the presence of an open port on 127.0.0.1 that speaks\nHTTP without using timing information, and thus without the Windows TCP behavior assumption (e.g., by\nhandling the onerror and oncomplete events of certain types of link elements).\n\n\nWe are unsure whether the purpose of the antivirus profiling is to identify potentially exploitable antivirus\nsoftware running on a target’s computer, or for evasion of antivirus products. In December 2015, Google\nSecurity discovered a critical vulnerability in Avast’s antivirus product, which involved a webpage sending\nHTTP requests to a port that Avast opens on 127.0.0.1. Google Security demonstrated that the\nvulnerability allowed exfiltration of arbitrary files from a victim’s disk.41 In January 2016, Google Security\ndiscovered a critical vulnerability in Trend Micro’s antivirus product, which similarly involved a web page\nsending HTTP requests to a port that Trend Micro opens on 127.0.0.1. Google Security demonstrated\nthat the vulnerability allowed arbitrary command execution.\n\n## 4. The Case of the Fake Journalist\n\n\n-----\n\n_In the course of our investigation we scanned the e-mail of journalist Donaghy and found evidence that_\n_he had been contacted by a fictitious journalist, whom we linked to Stealth Falcon._\n\nWe scanned Donaghy’s GMail account for any previous messages featuring links that redirected through\n**aax.me. We identified the following message from December 2013, purporting to be from a UK journalist**\nnamed Andrew Dwight:\n\n**From:** [andrew.dwight389@outlook.com](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:andrew.dwight389@outlook.com)\n**Subject: FW: Correspondence RequestGreetings Mr. Donaghy,I have been trying to reach you for**\ncomment and I am hoping that this e-mail reaches the intended recipient. My name is Andrew Dwight\nand I am currently writing a book about my experiences in the Middle East. My focus is on human factors\nand rights issues in seemingly non-authoritarian regimes (that are, in reality, anything but). I was hoping\nthat I might correspond with you and reference some of your work, specifically this piece\n(http://goo.gl/60HAqJ), for the book. I’m quite impressed with the way you articulate this complex issue\nfor the masses, and hope to have a similar impact with my book.\nHappy New Year,\n\nAndrew\n\nThe link in the email, http://goo.gl/60HAqJ, redirects to http://aax.me/0b152, which, as of December\n2015, redirected to a 2013 Huffington Post blog post authored by Donaghy.42 We did not observe any\n**redirect.php behavior with this link; as of December 2015, the aax.me link directly served an HTTP 302**\nredirect to the Huffington Post (we omitted the date header below). However, it is possible that the link\nformerly exhibited redirect.php behavior:\n```\nHTTP/1.1 302 Moved Temporarily\nDate:\nServer: Apache/2.2.9 (Debian) mod_ssl/2.2.9 OpenSSL/0.9.8g\nX-Powered-By: PHP/5.2.6-1+lenny13\nLocation: http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/rori-donaghy/uae-94_b_3549671.html\nVary: Accept-Encoding\nContent-Type: text/html\n\n```\nWe found that Donaghy had responded to this message shortly after receiving it, offering to meet inperson with Andrew in the UK. Andrew responded several weeks later with the following:\n\n**From:** [andrew.dwight389@outlook.com](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:andrew.dwight389@outlook.com)\n**Subject: RE: Correspondence RequestHello Rori,Happy New Year!

While we were\nunable to establish if @Dwight389 successfully attacked any of these individuals, we profile the targets\nbelow.\n\n### 4.1. Another Target: Obaid Yousef Al-Zaabi\n\n_This section describes how the fake journalist persona contacted Obaid Yousef Al-Zaabi, a blogger who_\n_was arrested for criticising the UAE._\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 11: @Dwight389 contacted @bukhaledobaid on 24 April 2013_**\n\nObaid Yousef Al-Zaabi was arrested on 2 July 201343 for Tweeting about the UAE94 detainees (94\ndefendants prosecuted in a mass trial on charges of attempting to overthrow the government)44 on his\n**@bukhaledobaid account, which displays his real name.45** He was released due to health problems a\nmonth later, but was arrested again on 12 December 2013,46 a day after talking to CNN47 about the\ncondition of US citizen Shezanne Cassim, imprisoned for making a parody video48 about “youth culture in\nDubai”.49 Al-Zaabi and Cassim were imprisoned in the same cellblock. Al-Zaabi was acquitted on 23\nJune 2014 of all charges including “slander concerning the rulers of the UAE using phrases that lower\ntheir status, and accusing them of oppression” and “disseminating ideas and news meant to mock and\ndamage the reputation of a governmental institution,” but, according to information received from two\nUAE sources, Al-Zaabi is still imprisoned in the prisoners ward of a hospital. A coalition of 13 human\nrights organizations including Amnesty International consider Al-Zaabi’s ongoing detention to be arbitrary,\nand without legal basis.50 Amnesty International reported that “a senior State Security Prosecution\nofficial” told Al-Zaabi he would continue to be detained even if acquitted.51\n\n\nAl-Zaabi’s brother, Dr. Ahmed Al-Zaabi, is one of the UAE94 detainees and is currently serving a 10 year\nprison sentence. According to a report by the Gulf Center for Human Rights, Ahmed was tortured in\nprison: his fingernails were pulled out, and he was “beaten to the point he was left swollen, covered in\n_bruises all over his body and with large amounts of blood in his urine”.52_\n\n### 4.2. Another Target:Professor Abdullah Al-Shamsi\n\n_This section describes how the fake journalist persona contacted professor Abdullah Al-Shamsi, Vice_\n_Chancellor of the British University in Dubai._\n\n**_Figure 12: @Dwight389 sent a message on 9 May 2013 suggesting he had targeted_**\n**_@shamsiuae58_**\n\n\nProfessor Abdullah Al-Shamsi (@shamsiuae58) is the Vice Chancellor of the British University in\nDubai.53 He (Arabic name: 54(أ.د.ﻋﺒﺪاﷲ ﻣﺤﻤﺪ رﺣﻤﺔ اﻟﺸﺎﻣﺴﻲ is signatory #79 (out of 133) to a March 2011\npetition to the UAE government55 for direct elections56 (UAE activist Ahmed Mansoor was arrested after\nsigning the same petition).57 Al-Shamsi’s father (ﻣﺤﻤﺪ ﺑﻦ رﺣﻤﺔ اﻟﻌﺎﻣﺮي اﻟﺸﺎﻣﺴﻲ) was appointed to, and chaired\nthe first sessions of, the Federal National Council (FNC), a legislative advisory council that is now an\nelected body. He called for more powers to be given to the FNC.58\n\n### 4.3. Additional Targets: Qatari Citizens Sentenced to Prison\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 13: @Dwight389 contacted @northsniper on 7 November 2013_**\n\nIn May 2015, five Qataris were sentenced (one present in the UAE to 10 years in prison, and four in\nabsentia to life in prison), for posting allegedly offensive pictures of the UAE Royal Family on three\nTwitter accounts and two Instagram accounts,59 including @northsniper.60 At trial, the prosecution\naccused the five of being agents of Qatar’s State Security, and posting the allegedly offensive pictures as\npart of a “military mission” to “show that Emiratis had offended their own leaders”.61 The @northsniper\naccount is currently suspended. One Instagram account allegedly used by defendants in this case\n(@9ip) is still active, and still appears to display unflattering photoshopped images of the President,\nCrown Prince, and Founder of the UAE.62\n\n\n## 5. Stealth Falcon’s Widespread Targeting of UAE Figures\n\n_This section describes how we identified additional Stealth Falcon victims and bait content, and traced_\n_Stealth Falcon’s spyware to additional C2 servers._\n\n**aax.me links. The links we found indicated that we could easily probe aax.me to get a comprehensive**\nlist of all currently active short URLs, and their corresponding long URLs. Our findings point to a UAEfocused operator, whose bait content and targets are linked to the Emirates. Furthermore, we were able\nto connect this attack to case from December 2012, where an anonymous UAE activist contacted us and\nclaimed to have received a suspicious link from a Twitter account that was purportedly under government\ncontrol.\n\n### 5.1. Public Targets and Links to Arrests\n\n_This section describes 24 Stealth Falcon Twitter targets we identified on the basis of them receiving an_\n_aax.me link in a Twitter mention._\n\nWe found aax.me links targeting 24 accounts, each of whom was mentioned in a tweet that also\ncontained an aax.me shortened link. We were unable to get details about 17 of the accounts. Of the\n**accounts we have been able to identify, several individuals were subsequently arrested or**\n**convicted in absentia by the UAE Government in relation to their online activities.**\n\nThe following table outlines these cases, and notes arrests.

Owner claimed\naffiliation with State Security Apparatus.\n\n\n[We list additional details in Appendix D: Public Stealth Falcon Tweets.](https://citizenlab.ca/2016/05/stealth-falcon-appendices/)\n\n### 5.2. Ennumerating aax.me for Bait Content\n\n_This section describes how we probed every conceivable short URL on aax.me, and found 402 pieces of_\n_bait content that we believe were sent by Stealth Falcon._\n\nAll of the public aax.me links we found, as well as the links sent to Donaghy, matched the regular\nexpression /aax\\.me\\/[0-9a-f]{5}/. Assuming all links shortened via aax.me match this regular expression,\nthere are only 165 (1,048,576) possible short URLs. We sent a request to aax.me for each possible\nURL, and observed the returned page or redirect. We found 57 URLs that exhibited the redirect.php\n\n\n-----\n\nprofiling behavior, and 524 URLs that returned an HTTP 302 redirect to an expanded URL. The other\n1,047,995 aax.me links returned a HTTP 302 redirect to the aax.me homepage; we assume these short\nURLs were unassigned to an expanded URL, as of the time of our scan.\n\nWe coded the long URLs where the URLs were still active, or where we could find an archived copy of, or\nsome information about, the URL. We were able to code 535 URLs, and failed to code 46 URLs as the\ncorresponding websites were down, and we could not find reliable information about what content the\n[URLs contained. See Appendix E: Results of aax.me Scan for details. We coded 133 URLs as](https://citizenlab.ca/2016/05/stealth-falcon-appendices/)\n“advertisement” (25% of all coded URLs), as they appeared to represent an advertisement for a product.\nThe vast majority of these advertisements seemed to be products typically marketed via spam (e.g.,\n“dietary supplement” or “green coffee”). We suspect that these links may have been shortened by\nspammers, as the aax.me URL shortening page is pubilcly accessible and indexed by Google, and\nYOURLS advises that publicly accessible URL shorteners will receive spam.83 All “advertisement” links\nwere 302 redirects, and none were redirect.php links. This is consistent with our observation that the\n**aax.me public interface only permits visitors to shorten links using the 302 redirect method.**\n\nWe filtered out the short URLs classified as “advertisement.” There were 402 non-advertisement short\nURLs that we tagged. We display a summary of the top ten tags below:\n\n**Tag** **Number of Short URLs** **% of non-advertisement URLs**\n\nUAE 292 73%\n\nTorture 57 14%\n\nSecurity Forces 49 12%\n\nDenaturalization 46 11%\n\nIsa bin Zayed 42 10%\n\nRule of Law 40 10%\n\nCriticism 40 10%\n\nABC News 40 10%\n\nViolations 33 8%\n\nIslam 29 7%\n\nWe noted that a number of long URLs had multiple corresponding short URLs.

A Connection to an Account Potentially Under UAE Government Control\n\n_This section describes a case from December 2012 where an Emirati activist said he received links_\n_connected to aax.me from an account that may have been under UAE government control._\n\nIn December 2012, an author of this report was contacted by an Emirati activist, who reported that an\naccount, @WeldBudhabi, had sent him a link on 14 December 2012 via Twitter direct message that took\nhim to a page on a7rarelemarat.com. A report by BBC notes that UAE authorities on 14 December\n2012 arrested an individual who they believed to be associated with @WeldBudhabi, and that the\naccount was “reportedly hacked by the authorities” on the same day.84 The Emirati activist told us that he\nlater contacted @WeldBudhabi, who reported that he did not send the link.\n\nThis link provides the strongest connection between Stealth Falcon and the UAE Authorities that we are\naware of.\n\n**a7rarelemarat.com is a now-defunct website that purported to be an opposition web forum for**\ndiscussing Emirati issues, and providing proxy tools for “hiding from the thugs” (presumably a reference\nto the UAE State Security Apparatus). We found four links involving aax.me posted by the site’s Twitter\naccount, @a7rarelemarat. We display two Tweets below, as the rest of the Tweets had the same links:\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 14: @a7rarelemarat targeted @WeldBudhabi with a malicious link on 20 October 2012_**\n\nTwitter’s API records the date of the tweet’s creation:\n\nSun Oct 21 05:05:41 +0000 2012\n\nWe also accessed the goo.gl link statistics, and found that the goo.gl link in the tweet was created less\nthan two minutes prior to the tweet:\n\n2012-10-21T05:03:45.585+00:00\n\nThe second tweet exhibited a similar pattern:\n\n**_Figure 15: @a7rarelemarat publicly sent a malicious link on 2 October 2012_**\n\nTwitter’s API records the date of the tweet’s creation:\n\nWed Oct 03 06:54:33 +0000 2012\n\nWe again accessed the goo.gl link statistics, and found that the goo.gl link in the tweet was created less\nthan one minute prior to the tweet:\n\n2012-10-03T06:53:45.151+00:00\n\n\n-----\n\nThe link redirects to https://www.a7rarelemarat.com/vb/showthread.php?p=3423#post3423 via\n**http://aax.me/d910a.**\n\nThe use of both goo.gl and aax.me in these cases suggests that the goo.gl link may have been\ndesigned to conceal the aax.me domain. Also, the proximity in creation time between the Tweet and the\n**goo.gl link suggests that the person who posted the Tweet through @a7rarelemarat was likely the same**\nperson who created the goo.gl link.\n\nWe suspect that the aax.me operator had some control over @a7rarelemarat at the time, and may have\nhad control of a7rarelemarat.com as well.\n\n### 5.4. Infrastructure Analysis of Stealth Falcon Command & Control\n\n_This section describes how we traced Stealth Falcon’s spyware to live C2 servers and domain names._\n\nWe fingerprinted the behavior of adhostingcache.com (the C2 server for the Stage One spyware that\nDonaghy received) and traced it to a series of 14 active IP adresses and 11 domains (using\nPassiveTotal85). Nine domains are named like generic Internet backend servers (e.g.,\n**simpleadbanners.com, clickstatistic.com), whereas two appear to be thematically related to travel**\n(bestairlinepricetags.com, fasttravelclearance.com), perhaps indicative of travel-themed targeting or\ntargets.\n\n\nWe fingerprinted the behavior of incapsulawebcache.com (the C2 server for the Stage Two spyware\nthat Donaghy receied) and scanned the Internet (including historical scanning results86) for servers that\nmatched our fingerprint. We also used Passive DNS to correlate IP addresses to domains. In total, we\nassociated 67 active (and 30 historical) IP addresses with the Stage Two spyware. Using PassiveTotal,\nwe linked 69 domain names to these IP addresses, the earliest registered on 28 January 2013, and the\nmost recent registered on 19 April 2016. The vast majority of the domains are named like generic\nInternet backend servers. One domain name appears to be travel-themed (airlineadverts.com), and\ntwo appear to be news and/or government themed (ministrynewschannel.com,\n**ministrynewsinfo.com).**\n\nThe earliest date we found an IP addresses matching our Stage Two fingerprint was 21 July 2014, as\nrecorded by sonar-ssl scans. It is possible that the operator used a different configuration of spyware\nbetween January 2013 and July 2014.\n\nWe traced several additional domains to Stealth Falcon using WHOIS information, or Passive DNS. Of\nthese, one was designed to impersonate a China-based provider of VoIP solutions (yeastarr.com), and\ntwo appeared to perhaps contain the Arabic word for security, “amn,” (amnkeysvc.com,\n**amnkeysvcs.com). Full scan results and other indicators of targeting can be found in Appendix F:**\n**Indicators of Targeting.**\n\nThe domain names we found were typically registered with WHOIS privacy providers. Although, in some\ncases, we were able to obtain the true registration email through historical WHOIS. Typically, the\noperators practiced disciplined operational security: we rarely found an email address that was used to\nregister two domains, and we rarely found two domains linked to the same IP address.\n\n### 5.5. May 2016: New Stealth Falcon Document\n\nIn May 2016, the following document was submitted to VirusTotal:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nFilename: message_032456944343.docm\nMD5:    87e1df6f36b96b56186444e37e2a1ef5\nSHA1:   1c3757006f972ca957d925accf8bbb3023550d1b\nSHA256:  4320204d577ef8b939115d16110e97ff04cb4f7d1e77ba5ce011d43f74abc7be\n\n```\nThe document was similar to the one sent to Donaghy, except that it purported to be encrypted with\nWordSecure, “a simple, HIPAA .. business-grade software for sharing encrypted files and secure\n_messages with anyone”.87_ The bait content was a single line of text reading:\n\nMESSAGE_ERROR: 0E684AD042_(LANGUAGE NOT SUPPORTED)\n\nThe document’s macro was identical to the one sent to Donaghy, except it reported back to, and\ndownloaded Stage Two from a different URL: http://optimizedimghosting.com/wddf/hrrw/ggrr.txt.\nThe server optimizedimghosting.com matched our Stage One fingerprint for adhostingcache.com.\n\nWe obtained Stage Two, which appeared to be a newer version of the Stage Two than in Donaghy’s\ncase. The Stage Two in this case reported back to\n**https://edgecacheimagehosting.com/images/image.nfo. The server edgecacheimagehosting.com**\nmatched our Stage Two fingerprint for incapsulawebcache.com.\n\nWhen we connected, the Stage Two server sent us additional commands (which we were unable to\nobtain in Donaghy’s case). The Stage Two C2 sent us a bundle of 7 commands, that did the following:\n\n1. Gathered system info from WMI\n2. Gathered the ARP table\n3. Gathered a list of running processes\n4. Materialized a file “OracleJavaUpdater.ps1” to disk. This file gathers passwords and web browser\n\n\ndata from a variety of sources: Windows Credential Vault, Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome,\nOutlook. In general, the file appears to be bespoke attacker code, though some routines are copied\nfrom other sources (e.g., some Internet Explorer password gathering code appears to be lifted from\nthe GPLv3-licensed QuasarRAT88)\n5. Executed “OracleJavaUpdater.ps1”\n6. Deleted “OracleJavaUpdater.ps1”\n7. Gathered a list of running processes again\n\nAfter command execution, results were returned to the Stage Two C2.\n\n## 6. Tip of the Iceberg: Possibly Related Attacks\n\nWe suspect that the activity we have observed is simply the tip of the iceberg in ongoing attacks against\ndissidents in the UAE. Reuse of tactics, techniques and procedures and general carelessness by\noperators can often lead to discovery of links between campaigns. We briefly discuss some instances of\npotentially related attacks below.\n\n### 6.1. An Instagram attack?\n\nWe noticed that one of the Twitter accounts that sent out aax.me links, @um_zainab123, solicited\nfollowers for an Instagram account @al7ruae2014.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 16: @um_zainab123 soliciting followers for Instagram account @al7ruae2014 on 26 April_**\n**_2014_**\n\n**_Figure 17: The @al7ruae2014 Instagram account_**\n\nWe contacted an activist with knowledge of the UAE94 case, who told us that the @al7ruae2014\nInstagram account got in touch with several family members of detainees involved in the case, and was\nsoliciting information from them via Instagram private message. The domain name al7ruae2014.com\nhas the same name as the Instagram account, so we suspect it may also be related to the operator.\n\n### 6.2. A fake file sharing site?\n\nWe identified one aax.me link (http://aax.me/4b708) that points to\n**http://velocityfiles.com/download.php?id=a81abdd8a0c0cd1d5d3b6baadcc9eb18. We visited this**\nlink in February 2016, and were served a blank page. VelocityFiles appears to have been disabled in\nMarch 2016.\n\nWe found that the site purported to be a file hosting site, where users could register and upload files.\nHowever, the registration and signup pages are currently blank, and were blank as of the Internet\nArchive’s oldest capture of the pages in December 2013.89 We were unable to identify any links to\nvelocityfiles.com from Twitter, or any pages indexed by Google.\n\n\nThe design of VelocityFiles appeared to be a loosely modified version of a public website design\ntemplate.90 Given that the site appears to be designed to pose as a public file sharing service, has no\nobvious public functionality, and was linked to through aax.me, we suspect that it may have been an\nattack site.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 18: Comparison between web design template image (left) and VelocityFiles website_**\n**_(right)._**\n\nGiven VelocityFiles’ reference to “FREE MD5 HASHING” (their emphasis), it is possible that the value of\nthe id parameter in the URL, a81abdd8a0c0cd1d5d3b6baadcc9eb18, represents the MD5 hash of a file.\nWe were, however, unable to locate any file with this MD5 hash.\n\n### 6.3. Fake web forums?\n\nWe found an aax.me link91 that pointed to https://call4uaefreedom.com/vb. The domain was\nregistered on 5/15/2013 and expired on 5/15/2015. We were unable to find any webpages or tweets\nlinking to this website. A Google search for “call4uaefreedom” reveals a blog, containing five posts, all\nwithin a 30 minute span on 4 June 2013, and an empty Twitter account @call4uaefreedom, created in\nMay 2013. Given the suspicious activity associated with the alias “call4uaefreedom,” this may have been\ncreated by operators.\n\n\nWhile searching for domains with similar domain names, we came across uaefreedom.com. The\ndomain name was first registered on 11 June 2010 by the administrators of UAE Hewar,92 an online\ndiscussion forum founded in 2009 that was a frequent government target.

Attribution\n\nIn this section, we analyze two competing hypotheses about the identity of Stealth Falcon, and conclude\nthat the balance of evidence suggests Stealth Falcon may be linked to the UAE government.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Hypothesis 1: Stealth Falcon is State Sponsored\n\nStealth Falcon is a sophisticated threat actor, capable of deploying a wide range of technical and social\nengineering techniques against a potential target. The operations targeting Donaghy are linked to a\nseries of primarily UAE-focused campaigns against UAE dissidents, starting in January 2012. While\nthere is no “smoking gun,” several pieces of evidence suggest a connection between Stealth Falcon and\nthe UAE Government.\n\n**UAE Focused Targeting, Links to Arrests**\n\nThe majority (73%) of bait content on aax.me was focused on UAE-related political issues (Section 5.2).\nFurthermore, of the 27 victim Twitter accounts we linked to public Stealth Falcon targeting, 24 primarily\n**engaged in political activities, or were otherwise critical of the UAE government (Section 5.1). Of**\nthese 24, we were able to find a subsequent arrest or a conviction in absentia by the UAE government.\n\n**Tweets During a Period of Government Control**\n\nA reported case in which a Twitter account apparently under UAE Government control shared a Stealth\nFalcon link also suggests a connection.\n\nIn December 2012, an activist contacted us and asserted that an a7rarelemarat.com link was sent to\nhim in a private message from the @WeldBudhabi account the same day that an individual accused of\noperating the account was arrested, and while the account was “reportedly hacked by authorities”.96 The\nactivist asserted that he contacted an owner of the account, who claimed he did not send that link. The\nTwitter account associated with a7rarelemarat.com, @a7rarelemarat, appears to have been under the\ncontrol of Stealth Falcon at some point during October 2012 (and possibly before and after), as the\naccount sent several aax.me links in October 2012.\n\n**Sophisticated Target Knowledge and Operational Security**\n\nStealth Falcon demonstrates some familiarity with the patterns of behavior, interests, and activities of its\ntargets, suggesting that the operators may have been working with other sources of information about\ntheir targets’ behaviors. In addition, Stealth Falcon displayed above-average operational security\nthroughout the campaign. Some of the social engineering was highly intricate, particularly the email from\nAndrew Dwight about his ski holiday. Stealth Falcon also shows familiarity with creating and maintaining\na range of fictitious personas, and registering and managing a significant amount of attack and C2\ninfrastructure with concern for operational security.\n\nThe infrastructure behind the malware attacks showed good compartmentalization of identities. We rarely\nfound the same (fake) registration information used for more than one C2 domain. Stealth Falcon\noperators also appear to have deleted one of their attack domains, adhostingcache.com when they\nrealized their attempt to target Donaghy had failed. We also noted that the (self-signed) SSL certificates\non the C2 domains were changed several times as we monitored the infrastructure, perhaps in an\nattempt to thwart fingerprinting of their infrastructure via SSL certificates.\n\nThis level of sophistication is consistent with a state sponsored attacker. Importantly, we found little\nevidence that indicate criminal or other motivation for the attack, with no evidence of financial or industry\ntargeting.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe also note that while some Stealth Falcon domains were registered on\nanonymousbitcoindomains.com, which is linked to APT28 activities, we found no evidence to support\n[such a connection. See Appendix G: No Evidence of APT28 Connection for more details.](https://citizenlab.ca/2016/05/stealth-falcon-appendices/)\n\n### Hypothesis 2: Stealth Falcon is Not State Sponsored\n\nWe have considered the possibility that Stealth Falcon’s operators are not state sponsored, but ultimately\nfind little evidence to support this possibility.\n\nStealth Falcon’s attacks show no evidence of cyber criminal motivations, like financial theft or fraud, nor\nis there any evidence of attempts to steal intellectual property or conduct other forms of economic\nespionage. Instead, the targets are politically engaged individuals and public figures. Furthermore, the\nactivity of targets we have been able to identify often concerns domestic UAE issues. Therefore, we\nwould need to posit an operator with an interest in individuals known for their engagement in domestic\nUAE issues.\n\nOther potential motivations might include blackmail or extortion. If this were the case, however, we might\nexpect follow-up interactions between attackers and successful victims, and we would also expect\nattackers to use off-the-shelf Remote Access Tools (RATs), rather than apparently coding a generalpurpose RAT from scratch. This would save them the trouble of needing to load additional malware to\nexfiltrate files or other material. We are aware of no evidence of follow-up interactions between the\noperators and successful victims as part of any extortion attempts. Furthermore, Stealth Falcon’s use of\nJavaScript to profile and de-anonymize victims seems inconsistent with a primary motivation of collecting\ninformation that could be used for blackmail.\n\nThe strongest scenario for a non-state sponsored attacker is thus a politically motivated group. Stealth\nFalcon targets are primarily individuals known for their criticism of the UAE government. It is perhaps\nconceivable that a group of pro-government hackers might, without coordination, target these individuals.\n\nThere are, however, several features of Stealth Falcon’s activities that tell against this possibility. First,\nthere is limited existing evidence that such autonomous groups exist and are active in the UAE. Given\nwhat is known about this kind of group, we might expect such a group to have engaged in defacements,\npublic boasting, or other public-facing activities related to Stealth Falcon’s campaign. Furthermore, it\nseems unlikely that a previously unknown political group would have the resources to develop and\nmaintain Stealth Falcon’s fictitious personas and compartmentalized infrastructure.\n\n### Evaluation of Hypotheses\n\nWe evaluated both hypotheses and found Hypothesis 1: Stealth Falcon is State Sponsored to be the\nbest at explaining the many elements that we have observed. Stealth Falcon’s tactics, resources, and\ntargets all fit with the profile of a state sponsored attacker. Furthermore, the circumstantial evidence we\nhave presented in this report is suggestive of a link between Stealth Falcon and an entity within the UAE\nGovernment.\n\n## 8. Conclusion: The Big Picture\n\nStealth Falcon appears to be a new, state sponsored threat actor. As an operator, Stealth Falcon is\ndistinguished by well informed and sophisticated social engineering, combined with moderately\nsophisticated97 technical attempts to deanonymize and monitor political targets working on the UAE, and\nrelatively simple malcode.98\n\n\n-----\n\n### Social Engineering and the Achilles Heel of Civil Society\n\nStealth Falcon’s technical approach may not be cutting edge, but the operators are neither\nunsophisticated or ineffective. Analyzed holistically as an operation, Stealth Falcon is a logical and multipronged approach to compromising and unmasking a class of targets. Stealth Falcon’s campaign\nhighlights the power of social engineering, once a technical bar has been met, in conducting a large scale\ncampaign.\n\nContemporary social movements and civil society groups rely heavily on the internet for both their core\noperations, as well as advocacy activities. Yet these groups are often operating outside a centrally\nmanaged IT environment. The constant sharing of links and materials, as well as regular\ncommunications with journalists makes them especially vulnerable to targeting with social engineering.\n\nHowever, the emphasis on social engineering can also cut in the other direction. Many modern attack\ntechniques require an attacker to interact with a target. When operators like Stealth Falcon send\nmalicious e-mails and tweets, there are a range of opportunities for retrospective investigation. As this\nreport shows, the inboxes of targets, for example, are often a more efficient object of investigation than\ncomputers themselves, especially once features of a particular campaign are recognized.\n\n### The Growing Trend of Impersonating Journalists\n\nStealth Falcon is only the latest example of civil society-focused threat actors impersonating NGOs and\njournalists to conduct espionage operations. The tactic has been used by a wide range of actors,\nincluding Bahrain’s government,99 Packrat in Latin America,100 Iranian groups,101 and China related\ngroups,102 among others. Threat actors seem to gravitate towards this tactic because interacting with\njournalists is an essential part of civil society activity. It is common for journalists to send unsolicited\nmessages to activists and civil society organizations asking for information, and there is typically a strong\nincentive for the organization to engage. Indeed, even Western law enforcement agencies have\noccasionally adopted the approach.103 The reporter-source relationship is protected in many\njurisdictions, based on the understanding that protecting this trust is important to a healthy and vibrant\ncivil society. Tactics that play on this trust are risky, and can quickly contribute to eroding the trust on\nwhich civil society is based.\n\n\n**Final Note: A Plea for More Research**\n\nImportantly, while we were unable to identify evidence of a conclusive link between Stealth Falcon and a\nparticular sponsor, we have assembled a body of circumstantial evidence that points to an alignment of\ninterests between Stealth Falcon and the UAE Security Forces. We hope that other researchers will\ndraw from our findings and work to identify additional cases. Finally, we urge anyone who recalls\nreceiving a link to “aax.me,” or an email from “Andrew Dwight” to contact the authors of this report for\nfurther investigation.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nSpecial thanks to PassiveTotal and Rori Donaghy.
