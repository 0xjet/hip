The primary purpose of these malware families is to compromise\nvulnerable internet-connected devices, amass them into botnets, and use them to perform\n[distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/distributed-denial-of-service-ddos-attacks/)\n\n## Linux-based Malware and IoT\n\n\n-----\n\nLinux powers most of today s cloud infrastructure and web servers, yet it also powers mobile\nand IoT devices. It’s popular because it offers scalability, security features and a wide range\nof distributions to support multiple hardware designs and great performance on any\nhardware requirements.\n\nWith various Linux builds and distributions at the heart of cloud infrastructures, mobile and\nIoT, it presents a massive opportunity for threat actors. For example, whether using\nhardcoded credentials, open ports or unpatched vulnerabilities, Linux-running IoT devices\nare a low-hanging fruit for threat actors — and their en masse compromise can threaten the\nintegrity of critical internet services. More than 30 billion IoT devices are projected to be\nconnected to the internet by the end of 2025, creating a potentially very large attack surface\nfor threats and cybercriminals to create massive botnets.\n\nA [botnet is a network of compromised devices connected to a remote command-and-control](https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/botnets/)\n(C2) center. It functions as a small cog in the larger network, and can infect other devices.\nBotnets are often used for DDoS attacks, spamming targets, gaining remote control and\nperforming CPU-intensive activities like cryptomining. DDoS attacks use multiple internetconnected devices to access a specific service or gateway, preventing legitimate traffic from\npassing through by consuming the entire bandwidth, causing it to crash.\n\nThe 2016 Mirai botnet incident serves as a reminder that a large number of seemingly\nbenign devices performing a DDoS attack can disrupt critical internet services, affecting both\norganizations and average users.\n\n## Top Linux Threats in Today’s Landscape\n\nAnalyzing the current Linux threat landscape, the XorDDoS, Mirai and Mozi malware families\nand variants have emerged as the most prolific in 2021, accounting for over 22% of all IoT\nLinux-targeting malware.\n\n### XorDDoS: 123% Increase in Malware Samples\n\nXorDDoS is a Linux trojan compiled for multiple Linux architectures, ranging from ARM to\n[x86 and x64. Its name is derived from using XOR encryption in malware and network](https://blog.malwaremustdie.org/2014/09/mmd-0028-2014-fuzzy-reversing-new-china.html)\ncommunication to the C2 infrastructure.\n\nWhen targeting IoT devices, the trojan is known to use SSH brute-forcing attacks to gain\nremote control on vulnerable devices.\n\nFig. 1- Docker’s [official documentation (Click to enlarge)](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/dockerd/)\n\n\n-----\n\nOn Linux machines, some variants of XorDDoS show that its operators scan and search for\nDocker servers with the 2375 port open. This port offers an unencrypted Docker socket and\n[remote root passwordless access to the host, which attackers can abuse to get root access](https://madhuakula.com/content/attacking-and-auditing-docker-containers-using-opensource/attacking-docker-containers/misconfiguration.html)\nto the machine.\n\nCrowdStrike researchers have found that the number of XorDDoS malware samples\nthroughout 2021 has increased by almost 123% compared to 2020.\n\nFig. 2 – Falcon detection for Linux XorDDoS malware sample (Click to enlarge)\n\n### Mozi: 10 Times More Prevalent in 2021\n\nMozi is a peer-to-peer (P2P) botnet network that utilizes the distributed hash table (DHT)\nsystem, implementing its own extended DHT. The distributed and decentralized lookup\nmechanism provided by DHT enables Mozi to hide C2 communication behind a large amount\nof legitimate DHT traffic.\n\n\n-----\n\nFig. 3 – Credits: [Kn0wledge](https://kn0wledge.fr/projects/mozitools/)\n\nThe use of DHT is interesting because it allows Mozi to quickly grow a P2P network. And,\nbecause it uses an extension over DHT, it’s not correlated with normal traffic, so detecting\nthe C2 communication becomes difficult.\n\nMozi infects systems by brute-forcing SSH and Telnet ports. It then blocks those ports so that\nit is not overwritten by other malicious actors or malware.\n\nFig. 4 – Falcon detection for Linux Mozi malware sample (Click to enlarge)\n\n\n-----\n\n### Mirai: The Common Ancestor\n\nMirai malware has made a name for itself in the last few years, especially after its developer\npublished Mirai’s [source code. Similar to Mozi, Mirai abuses weak protocols and weak](https://github.com/jgamblin/Mirai-Source-Code/blob/master/ForumPost.txt)\npasswords, such as Telnet, to compromise devices using brute-forcing attacks.\n\nWith multiple Mirai variants emerging since its source code became public, the Linux trojan\ncan be considered the common ancestor to many of today’s Linux DDoS malware. While\nmost variants add onto existing Mirai features or implement different communication\nprotocols, at their core they share the same Mirai DNA.\n\nSome of the most prevalent variants tracked by CrowdStrike researchers involve Sora,\nIZIH9 and Rekai. Compared to 2020, the numbers of identified samples for all three variants\nhave increased by 33%, 39% and 83% respectively in 2021.\n\nFig. 5 – Falcon detection for Linux Mirai malware sample (Click to enlarge)\n\n### CrowdStrike Protection for Linux\n\nLinux is one of the primary operating systems for many business-critical applications. As\nLinux servers can be found on premises and in private and public clouds, protecting them\nrequires a solution that provides runtime protection and visibility for all Linux hosts,\nregardless of location.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe CrowdStrike Falcon® platform protects Linux workloads, including containers, running in\nall environments, from public and private clouds to on-premises and hybrid data centers.\n[Using machine learning, artificial intelligence, behavior-based indicators of attack (IOAs) and](https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/indicators-of-compromise/ioa-vs-ioc/)\ncustom hash blocking to defend Linux workloads against malware and sophisticated threats,\nthe Falcon platform delivers complete visibility and context into any attack on Linux\nworkloads.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)\n\n**File** **SHA256**\n```\n Mozi 4790754ccd895626c67f0d63736577d363de7e7684b624d584615d83532d1414\n XorDDoS f85f13bf67bba755ec5f4c46d760f460a2dc137494d7edf64aeb22ddc2f30760\n Mirai 4f2f4d758d13a9cb2fd4c71e8015ba622b2b4c1c26ceb1114b258d6e3c174010\n\n```\n**Additional Resources**\n\n_[Learn more about how the Falcon platform protects Linux systems in this solution brief.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/resources/data-sheets/linux-solution-brief/)_\n_Read_ _[this press release about CrowdStrike Falcon’s enhanced Linux protection.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/press-releases/crowdstrike-falcon-expands-linux-protection-with-enhanced-prevention-capabilities/)_\n_[Find out how the powerful CrowdStrike Falcon platform provides comprehensive](https://www.crowdstrike.com/endpoint-security-products/falcon-platform/)_\n_protection across your organization, workers, data and identities._\n_[Get a full-featured free trial of CrowdStrike Falcon Prevent™ and learn how true next-](https://www.crowdstrike.com/resources/free-trials/try-falcon-prevent/)_\n_gen AV performs against today’s most sophisticated threats._\n\n\n-----",
