    "plain_text": "# An Analysis of Sidoh: WIZARD SPIDER's Exfiltration Tool\n\n**[crowdstrike.com/blog/sidoh-wizard-spiders-mysterious-exfiltration-tool/](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/sidoh-wizard-spiders-mysterious-exfiltration-tool/)**\n\nAlexander Hanel August 31, 2021\n\nWIZARD SPIDER is an established, high-profile and sophisticated eCrime group, originally known for the\ncreation and operation of the TrickBot banking Trojan. This Russia-based eCrime group originally began\ndeploying TrickBot in 2016 to conduct financial fraud, but has since evolved into a highly capable group with a\n[diverse and potent arsenal, including Ryuk, Conti and BazarLoader. Their toolset covers the entirety of the kill](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/big-game-hunting-with-ryuk-another-lucrative-targeted-ransomware/)\nchain, from delivery to post-exploitation tools and big game hunting (BGH) ransomware, enabling WIZARD\nSPIDER to conduct a wide range of criminal activities against enterprise environments.\n\nSidoh (aka Ryuk Stealer) is a keyword-based exfiltration tool used by WIZARD SPIDER. Sidoh (as well as\n_Ryuk) is the name of a character from the anime series Death Note. In the series, the character Sidoh has an_\nitem stolen by Ryuk. Since WIZARD SPIDER’s tool is used for exfiltration, the name Sidoh is fitting.\n\nWIZARD SPIDER’s Sidoh has an aura of mystery due to its rarity and the keyword list it uses to determine what\ndata is exfiltrated. As of this blog’s publication, CrowdStrike Intelligence has observed 16 unique SHA256\nhashes, with nine of them containing unique build times (date and time of compilation) and with the first build\ndate of June 16, 2019, and the last build date of Jan. 18, 2020. Sidoh searches for specific file types with a fixed\nset of keywords. If a file matches Sidoh’s criteria, it is exfiltrated via FTP to a hardcoded IP address.\n\nThe list of keywords suggests the adversary is searching for and targeting data related to government, military\nand financial sectors. It is unknown if WIZARD SPIDER was using Sidoh to steal files for espionage purposes or\nif they were stealing files for extortion purposes. Stealing files for espionage purposes is unusual for criminal\n\n\n-----\n\nthreat actors. However, GameOver Zeus3 was a previously observed criminal malware family that searched\nvictim systems for files matching keywords related to foreign government officials, military documents, classified\ninformation and terrorism.\n\nThe keywords from the GameOver Zeus search queries resemble some of those found in Sidoh. In May 2019,\nOUTLAW SPIDER, the operators of RobbinHood ransomware, made headlines with ransoming the machines\nand exfiltrating data from the City of Baltimore (COB). This incident was one of the first instances observed by\nCrowdStrike Intelligence of data exportation to incentivize ransom payments. WIZARD SPIDER could have\ntaken notice of the exfiltration and data leak extortion tactic and wrote Sidoh as a tool to determine the value of\nexfiltrated data in a set of limited test runs inspired by OUTLAW SPIDER targeting of COB. In August 2020,\n[WIZARD SPIDER did add data exfiltration and data leak sites to the big game hunting list of tactics.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/data-exfiltration/)\n\nTwo variants of Sidoh have been observed by CrowdStrike Intelligence. The first variant was observed in midJune 2019 and the second was observed in mid-January 2020. Both versions are similar except for bug fixes\nand updated keyword lists. Upon initial analysis of the early versions of Sidoh, CrowdStike Intelligence\ndismissed the sample as being a variant of Ryuk. This initial assessment was based on a cursory analysis of\nSidoh’s WinMain function. Ryuk and Sidoh both contain functionality that reads a file passed as a command line\nargument, sleeps for 5,000 microseconds and then calls `DeleteFileW to delete the file. Along with the`\ndeletion of the file, Sidoh’s code was compiled in Visual Studio, contained the same API chains to accomplish\nspecific functionality and the code even “felt” like Ryuk.\n\n[It was only upon deeper inspection that it was realized that the sample was not Ryuk, but a family of malware](https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/malware/)\nthat looks to have borrowed code from Ryuk’s source code. Even though both Sidoh and Ryuk are compiled\nusing Visual Studio, they are not compiled using the same build chain. For example, a Ryuk binary compiled on\nJune 26, 2019, contains an older toolset than a Sidoh binary compiled on July 8, 2019. The difference in the\ndetected toolsets between Ryuk and Sidoh hint that the samples were compiled on different machines with\ndifferent installed versions of Visual Studio. Table 1 shows the detected Visual Studio toolsets for the binaries.\n\n**Ryuk** **Sidoh**\n\nVisual C++ 14.0.x 2015 (build 23918) Visual C++ 14.0 2015 (build 24215)\n\nVisual C++ 9.0 2008 SP1 (build 30729) Visual C++ 14.0.x 2015 (build 24210)\n\nVisual C++ 14.0.x 2015 (build 23907) Visual C++ 14.0 2015 (build 24215)\n\nVisual C++ 14.0.x 2015 (build 23918)\n\nVisual C++ 9.0 2008 SP1 (build 30729)\n\nVisual C++ 14.0.x 2015 (build 24123)\n\nTable 1. Ryuk and Sidoh detected toolsets\n\nThe exact intent of Sidoh is only known by the threat actors that operated it, but the keywords used by WIZARD\nSPIDER open up speculation of its targeted audience and usage of the exfiltrated data.\n\n## Technical Analysis \n\nThe following technical analysis is based on the newest version of Sidoh. Differences between the two variants\nare noted throughout the text when applicable.\n\nUpon execution, Sidoh checks for the presence of a command line argument passed to it. If the argument is\npresent, it is treated as a file path. Sidoh sleeps for 5,000 microseconds and then deletes the file if the argument\nis present. Sidoh lists all available drives on the host by calling GetLogicalDrives . For each available drive, it\n\n\n-----\n\ncalls `GetDriveTypeW to ensure the drive type is not` `DRIVE_CDROM . If the drive type is not a CD ROM, the`\ndrive path’s contents are searched. After the drives have been searched, Sidoh attempts to search the contents\nof hosts that have IP addresses present within the compromised host’s ARP entries. The ARP entries are\nretrieved by calling `GetIpNetTable . For each entry, Sidoh attempts to mount the IP address from within the`\nentry as a network drive, using Server Message Block (SMB), and then proceeds to search the drive.\n\nTo enumerate files on disk, Sidoh calls `FindFirstFileW and` `FindNextFileW . Sidoh contains a deny list`\ntargeting specific file types of folder names. Table 2 shows a block list of folders and file names whose contents\nare ignored by Sidoh.\n```\n Sample Music Sample Pictures $Recycle.Bin\n Tor Browser Package Cache RyukReadMe.txt**\n microsoft UNIQUE_ID_DO_NOT_REMOVE** PUBLIC\n windows PerfLogs Windows\n ProgramData Firefox Intel\n Mozilla Microsoft $WINDOWS\n Program Files \\\\Users\\\\Public\\\\Pictures MySQL\n log .dll AhnLab\n\n```\nTable 2. Sidoh folder name block list\n\nSome of the names in Table 2 are not directories (e.g., `.dll ). The fields that end with ** are names that are`\nartifacts from a Ryuk infection. For example, `RyukReadMe.txt was the name for Ryuk ransom notes before`\nWIZARD SPIDER switched the ransom note to HTML.\n\nSidoh does not attempt to exfiltrate files over 50MB, and earlier variants would not exfiltrate files over 20MB. If a\nfile is over 50MB, it is ignored. Along with folders names, Sidoh has an allow list of file extensions. Earlier\nvariants contained the file extension `.RYK, which is appended to files after being encrypted by Ryuk. The`\npresence of the string related to Ryuk suggests that Sidoh was either derived from the Ryuk source code or\ndesigned to be compatible with systems that have been encrypted by Ryuk. Table 3 contains the block list of file\nextensions for variant 2. The newer list is more extensive, likely with an end goal of speeding up time spent\nscanning the host for files.\n```\n .exe .sdi .pem .sys .xpi .rsm .msc\n .msi .dic .ibd .ddf .mp3 .wbverify .ascx\n .dll .pyd .db .sqlite cached .tmp .css\n .lnk .qml .h .ttf ppt .cat .browser\n .sdi .js .lib .cdx ppsm .asp .bmp\n .wim .png .microsoft .thmx cached .config .url\n .chm .log .txmx .new wtv .inf .search-ms\n .vicache .ini .tif .little NTUSER .din .wmv\n .chm .lnk .iobj .cdx .contact .oem .icml\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n .xml .cab .ipdb .gif .wbcat .ps1 readme\n\n```\nTable 3. Sidoh file extension name block list\n\nIf the filename contains an extension of `.cpp, .h .xls,` `.xlsx,` `.doc,` `.docx, . docb,` `.pdf or`\n```\nwallet.dat, an attempt to automatically exfiltrate the file is made. Early variants also included .txt and\n.gov file extension but were removed. Further details about the attempt are described in the next section,\n\n```\n_Exfiltration and Infrastructure. If the filename does not contain one of the previously mentioned file extensions,_\nthe filename is then checked against the keyword list in Table 4. If the filename contains one of the keywords in\nthe following table, the file is exfiltrated.\n\nSECURITY marketwired fbi Secret war victim federal\n\nN-CSR 10-Q csi scheme suspect court bureau\n\n10-SB 10Q gun tactical cyber hidden government\n\nEDGAR 8K NATO Engeneering document bribery security\n\nspy fraud Nato explosive treasonrestricted contraband unclassified\n\nradar hack convictMilitary drug private operation concealed\n\ncensored NSA military traitor confident undercover newswire\n\nagent FBI submarine embeddedspy important clandestine marketwired\n\nnewswire CSI Submarinesecret radio pass investigation Clearance\n\nTable 4. Sidoh file name exfiltration keyword list\n\nEarly variants of Sidoh contained functionality to search the contents of `.docx or` `.xlsx files. To search the`\ncontents of `.docx or` `.xlsx files, Sidoh must first parse the file type. Modern Microsoft Office documents are`\nstored in the Microsoft Open XML (MOX) format. This format primarily consists of a ZIP file with XML data.\nBefore decompressing the ZIP file, Sidoh would import a Dynamic Link Library (DLL) named `libzip.dll . It is`\nderived from the open-source C library, libzip, which can be used for reading, writing and modifying ZIP files.\nThis library is not installed on Windows by default. In order to execute properly, these early variants of Sidoh\nwould need `libzip.dll to be present within the working directory or within the standard DLL search order.`\nThe Sidoh executable and `libzip.dll are likely written to disk by a dropper.`\n\nOnce the libzip has been imported, it is used to decompress the document. Once decompressed, Sidoh reads\nthe path `word/document.xml for` `.docx files and` `xl/worksheets/sheet*.xml for` `.xlsx . The contents`\nare read into a buffer and then searched for the keywords in Table 5. The bug existed in how Sidoh searched\n```\n.xlsx for keywords. Data from rows and columns in Excel spreadsheets are not stored in\nxl/worksheets/sheet*.xml but are stored at the path xl/SharedStrings.xml . Therefore, the .xlsx file\n\n```\ndata that Sidoh reads and searches only contains the mapping of the rows and columns to fields in\n```\nSharedStrings.xml but none of the text that would contain the keywords being searched for. The reading and\n\n```\nsearching of `.docx or` `.xlsx` was removed in the newest variant, likely because of the described error.\nNewer variants simply read the contents of the file and search for one of the keywords in Table 5.\n\npersonal censored traitor checking clandestine seed Olivia\n\n\n-----\n\nsecurityN-CSR10SBEDGAR\n\n\nbribery suspect saving illegal personal Noah\n\n\nspy contraband cyber routing compromate confident Ava\n\nradaragentnewswire operation document finance privacy mail William\n\nmarketwired gun embeddedspy agreement private letter Isabella\n\n10-Q attack radio SWIFT contract passport James\n\n10Q military war BIC concealed victim** Sophia\n\n8K tank submarine IBAN backdoorundercover court Logan\n\nfraud convict fbi license clandestine id Clearance\n\nhack scheme restricted Compilation investigation NATO\n\nNSA tactical secret report federal Nato\n\nFBI Engeneering CSI secret bureau scans\n\ndefence explosive balance confident government Emma\n\ntreason drug statement hidden security Liam\n\nTable 5. Sidoh file name exfiltration keyword list\n\nThe lists in Table 4 and Table 5 contain many words that are misspelled (e.g., Engeneering) or two words\nconcatenated (e.g., treasonrestricted). These errors hint that this list was hastily imputed or never reviewed.\nFurther details about the attempts to upload the files are described next.\n\n### Exfiltration and Infrastructure\n\nSidoh uploads documents that match the search criteria to a command-and-control (C2) IP address via FTP with\na hard-coded username and password of `anonymous . If the FTP server is not available, Sidoh typically`\ncontains a backup IP address that it can use. One variant of Sidoh did not contain a backup IP address. Once\nconnected, the files are uploaded to a hard-coded directory with four random digits prefixing the original\nfilename. If the connections fail, Sidoh sleeps for a random amount of time (between 0 and 125 seconds) and\nthen tries to connect again. Sidoh does not keep an active connection to the FTP server but continuously logs\ninto the FTP server.\n\nIf during the exfiltration process Sidoh fails to connect to the C2 after three attempts, it scans the filename or\ncontents of files with an extension of `.cpp,` `.xls,` `.xlsx, . doc,` `.docx,` `.docb or` `.pdf for the targeted`\nkeywords to determine if additional effort should be made to exfiltrate those files. If there is a match, Sidoh\nmakes another three connection attempts. After each failed connection, Sidoh will sleep for a random amount of\ntime (between 0 and 125 seconds) between each attempt. If all attempts to connect to the C2 fail, Sidoh\ndiscards the current file being uploaded and continues to search for more files to exfiltrate.

Sidoh SHA256 Hashes and Build Time\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWIZARD SPIDER is one of the most sophisticated groups tracked by CrowdStrike. Their threat arsenal ranges\n[from banking trojans to spam bots to ransomware — with all of these tools designed with an end result of getting](https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/ransomware/)\nmoney from their victims. Some of these tools have been short-lived, but the diversity in tooling used by\nWIZARD SPIDER demonstrates their desire to use new strategies to monetize their attacks. It is unknown if\nSidoh is one such strategy that experimented with monetizing victims by stealing potentially sensitive or\nproprietary data, or if Sidoh was used by WIZARD SPIDER to steal data from specific victims at the request of a\nthird party.\n\nThere is even the possibility that the original Hermes source code (which Ryuk was derived from) was modified\nto be Sidoh, and the threat actors added the Ryuk file artifact references as a false flag. But the likely and\nsimplest solution is Sidoh was used in rare instances to automatically steal data from compromised hosts by\nWIZARD SPIDER.\n\nAs of this publication date, CrowdStrike has not observed Sidoh within the telemetry of our customers. If your\ncompany was a victim of Sidoh and you have further details you’d be willing to share, please reach out to\nCrowdStrike Intelligence.\n\n**Additional Resources**\n\n\n-----\n\n_For more intel about WIZARD SPIDER, visit the_ _[CrowdStrike Adversary Universe.](https://adversary.crowdstrike.com/en-US/adversary/wizard-spider/)_\n_To find out how to incorporate intelligence on threat actors into your security strategy, visit the_ _Falcon X™_\n_Threat Intelligence page._\n_[Learn about the powerful, cloud-native CrowdStrike Falcon® platform by visiting the product webpage.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/endpoint-security-products/)_\n_[Get a full-featured free trial of CrowdStrike Falcon Prevent™ to see for yourself how true next-gen AV](https://go.crowdstrike.com/try-falcon-prevent.html)_\n_performs against today’s most sophisticated threats._\n\n\n-----",
