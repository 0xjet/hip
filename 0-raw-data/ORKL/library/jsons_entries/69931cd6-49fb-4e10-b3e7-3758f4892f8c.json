    "plain_text": "# Iranian APT Charming Kitten impersonates ClearSky, the security firm that uncovered its campaigns\n\n**cyware.com/news/iranian-apt-charming-kitten-impersonates-clearsky-the-security-firm-that-uncovered-its-campaigns-**\n7fea0b4f\n\nIranian cyberespionage group Charming Kitten, which has been operating since 2014, has\nimpersonated the cybersecurity firm that exposed its operations and campaigns. Israeli firm\nClearSky Security said the group managed to copy its official website hosted on a similarlooking domain - clearskysecurity[.]net.\n\nClearSky's actual website is Clearskysec.com.\n\n### Fake ClearSky website\n\n\"Charming Kitten built a phishing website impersonating our company,\" ClearSky [said. \"They](https://twitter.com/ClearskySec/status/1013425897842597889)\ncopied pages from our public website and changed one of them to include a 'sign in' option\nwith multiple services. These sign in options are all phishing pages that would send the\nvictim's credentials to the attackers.\"\n\nClearSky's official website does not feature any sign-in options. Researchers noted the fake\nwebsite is likely still under construction.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt seems that the impersonating website is still being built because some of the pages have\nerror messages in them,\" ClearSky said.\n\nClearSky added that Charming Kitten was hosting the fake domain on an older server that\n[the researchers had ousted on June 12. They also found one page on the fake ClearSky](https://twitter.com/ClearskySec/status/1006445262003494913)\nwebsite that wasn't customized yet, but contained content from the attackers' earlier\ncampaign. This also further indicates Charming Kitten is likely behind the fake website.\n\nSince the website was still incomplete, ClearSky does not believe the hackers managed to\nphish anyone, adding that its employees, systems and clients were not affected by the\nincident. The fake website was marked as a suspicious website via the Safe Browsing API\nshortly after it was uncovered and has since been taken down.\n\n### Charming Kitten behavior\n\nThe advanced persistent threat (APT), also known as Newscaster or Newsbeef, has long\ntargeted academic researchers, human rights activists, political advisors, and media outlets\nthat are of interest to Iran.\n\nThe group usually attacks its targets leveraging made up organizations and people to lure\npeople into malicious websites, impersonating real companies, watering hole attacks and\nspear-phishing.\n\nAs one of Iran's oldest APTs, Charming Kitten has typically attacked targets in Iran, the\nUnited States, Israel and the UK among others. Some of the group's campaigns over the\npast few years include Saffron Rose, Newscaster and the StoneDrill wiper.\n\nOther legitimate companies impersonated by the hacking group include United Technologies\n(UTC). In early 2017, the attackers created a fake UTC website that claimed to offer \"Free\nSpecial Programs and Courses for Employees of Aerospace companies\" that designed to\ndupe visitors into downloading a fake Flash Player that was actually the group's DownPaper\nmalware.\n\nIranian national Behzad Mesri, who was charged in the US with hacking HBO and stealing\nmultiple Game of Thrones files, is believed to be a part of the Charming Kitten entourage.\n\n\"While Iranian threat actors have been well documented by security researchers, the inner\nworkings of the ecosystem of Iran's hackers is not entirely clear,\" ClearSky researchers\nwrote [in an earlier report. \"Groups can be vigorously active for years and then disappear](https://www.clearskysec.com/charmingkitten/)\nabruptly, sometimes due to being publicly outed. Researchers make a best-faith effort to\nassign operations to certain groups, but the instability in the field makes the process\nchallenging.\"\n\n\n-----\n\nClearSky Security Impersonation Attack Iranian Cyber Espionage\n\nIranian Hackers Fake Website\n\nPublisher\n\n## Cyware\n\n\n-----",
