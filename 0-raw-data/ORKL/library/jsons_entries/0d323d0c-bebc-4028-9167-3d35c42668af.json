Times and Tribune papers across the U.S.\n\n**[latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-times-delivery-disruption-20181229-story.html](https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-times-delivery-disruption-20181229-story.html)**\n\nEmily Alpert Reyes Dec. 29, 2018 8:10 PM PT\n\nThe Los Angeles Times and other newspapers were hit by a malware attack.\n\n(Los Angeles Times)\n\nBy Tony Barboza, Meg James, Emily Alpert Reyes\n\nWhat first arose as a server outage was identified Saturday as a malware attack, which\nappears to have originated from outside the United States and hobbled computer systems\nand delayed weekend deliveries of the Los Angeles Times and other newspapers across the\ncountry.\n\nTechnology teams worked feverishly to quarantine the computer virus, but it spread through\nTribune Publishing’s network and reinfected systems crucial to the news production and\nprinting process. Multiple newspapers around the country were affected because they share\na production platform.\n\nThe attack delayed distribution of Saturday editions of the Los Angeles Times and San Diego\nUnion Tribune. It also stymied distribution of the West Coast editions of the Wall Street\nJournal and New York Times, which are printed at the Los Angeles Times’ Olympic printing\nplant in downtown Los Angeles.\n\n\n-----\n\nBy Saturday afternoon, the company suspected the cyberattack originated from outside the\nUnited States, but officials said it was too soon to say whether it was carried out by a foreign\nstate or some other entity, said a source with knowledge of the situation.\n\n“We believe the intention of the attack was to disable infrastructure, more specifically\nservers, as opposed to looking to steal information,” said the source, who spoke on condition\nof anonymity because he was not authorized to comment publicly. The source would not\ndetail what evidence led the company to believe the breach came from overseas.\n\n**[Foreign cyberattack hits newspapers: Here is what we know »](https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-cyberattack-times-newspaper-malware-20181229-story.html)**\n\nTribune Publishing said in a statement Saturday that “the personal data of our subscribers,\nonline users, and advertising clients has not been compromised. We apologize for any\ninconvenience and thank our readers and advertising partners for their patience as we\ninvestigate the situation.”\n\n“Every market across the company was impacted,” said Marisa Kollias, spokeswoman for\nTribune Publishing. She declined to provide specifics on the disruptions, but the company’s\nproperties include the Chicago Tribune; Baltimore Sun; Capital Gazette in Annapolis, Md.;\nHartford Courant; New York Daily News; South Florida Sun Sentinel and Orlando Sentinel.\n\nNo other details about the origin of the attack were immediately available and the motive\nremained unclear.\n\nTribune Publishing sold The Times and the San Diego Union-Tribune to Los Angeles biotech\nentrepreneur Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong in June, but the two companies continue to share\nvarious systems, including software.\n\nIt’s unclear how many Times subscribers were impacted by late deliveries and the paper\ncould not provide firm numbers, but a source said that a majority received their papers\nSaturday morning, albeit several hours late. The Times said that print subscribers who did\nnot get their papers Saturday would receive them with their regularly scheduled delivery of\nthe Sunday edition.\n\n“We apologize to our customers for this inconvenience,” The Times said in a statement.\n“Thank you for your patience and support as we respond to this ongoing matter.”\n\nThe Times and the San Diego paper became aware of the problem near midnight on\nThursday. Programmers worked to isolate the bug, which Tribune Publishing identified as a\nmalware attack, but at every turn the programmers ran into additional issues trying to access\na myriad of files, including advertisements that needed to be added to the pages or paid\nobituaries.\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter identifying the server outage as a virus, technology teams made progress Friday\nquarantining it and bringing back servers, but some of their security patches didn’t hold and\nthe virus began to reinfect the network, impacting a series of servers used for news\nproduction and manufacturing processes.\n\nBy late Friday, the attack was hindering the transmission of pages from offices across\nSouthern California to printing presses as publication deadlines approached.\n\nAt one point, Times staffers were making contingency plans to hand-deliver pages from the\neditorial offices in El Segundo to its Olympic printing plant in downtown Los Angeles.\nWorking through the problems created a logjam at the plant, and the resulting cascade of\ndelays pushed back printing and delivery.\n\nSan Diego was particularly hard hit by the problem, in large part because of the paper’s\nposition in the press run. Between 85% and 90% of the Saturday edition of the UnionTribune did not reach subscribers on Saturday morning, said Jeff Light, publisher and editor\nof the San Diego Union-Tribune.\n\n“Papers that should have arrived in San Diego around 3 a.m. to 4 a.m. instead arrived at 7\na.m. and 8 a.m.” Light said. Because the newspaper relies on independent contractors to\ndeliver the paper to neighborhoods, many of those people were not available later in the day\nto do the deliveries.\n\nThe first signs of trouble at the Union-Tribune came late Thursday night when sports editors\ntried to send information, via digital files, to the plate-making facility. But those digital files\nwhich contain information that ultimately becomes the pages of the newspaper would not\ntransmit to the plate-making process. Editors seemed to be locked out of the system, having\nto perform work-arounds.\n\nThe transmission of community editions, including the Glendale News Press and Burbank\nLeader, also appeared in doubt Friday night. Ultimately, a page designer in Orange County\nfigured out he could send all the community papers’ news pages from his unaffected\ncomputer, said John Canalis, executive editor of Times Community News.\n\nThe problem caused widespread issues in South Florida, one of Tribune Publishing’s major\nmarkets. The South Florida Sun Sentinel told readers that it had been “crippled this weekend\nby a computer virus that shut down production and hampered phone lines,” according to a\nstory on its website.\n\nMalware attacks are extremely common, affecting millions of computers in homes, offices\nand other organizations every day, said Salim Neino, chief executive of the company Kryptos\nLogic.\n\nIn some cases, dubbed “ransomware,” the attackers disable the system and demand money,\nsaid Neino, whose company tackled a major ransomware attack called WannaCry last year.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn other instances, the goal is simply to disrupt or break stuff by wiping systems, Neino\nsaid. Malware has also been used to quietly infect computers and then sell access to other\ncybercriminals, who can steal banking credentials or exploit other valuable information,\nNeino said.\n\nSeveral individuals with knowledge of the Tribune situation said the attack appeared to be in\nthe form of “Ryuk” ransomware. One company insider, who was not authorized to comment\npublicly, said the corrupted Tribune Publishing computer files contained the extension “.ryk.”\n\n“Ryuk” attacks are “highly targeted, well-resourced and planned,” according to an August\nadvisory by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ cybersecurity program.\nVictims are deliberately targeted and “only crucial assets and resources are infected in each\ntargeted network.”\n\nIt was unclear whether company officials have been in contact with law enforcement\nregarding the suspected attack. But Katie Waldman, a spokeswoman for the Department of\nHomeland Security, said “we are aware of reports of a potential cyber incident effecting\nseveral news outlets, and are working with our government and industry partners to better\nunderstand the situation.”\n\nTribune declined to comment on the specifics of the malware attack.\n\nNeino also said that tracking the identity of attackers can be difficult since malware code is\noften freely distributed online.\n\nFor instance, even if an attack appears to be Russian because of the “malware family traits,”\nNeino said, “code still could have been sourced, weaponized and deployed by an actor who\ndownloaded it from an underground forum anywhere in the world.”\n\nPam Dixon, executive director of the World Privacy Forum, a nonprofit public interest\nresearch group, said that “usually when someone tries to disrupt a significant digital resource\nlike a newspaper, you’re looking at an experienced and sophisticated hacker.”\n\nDixon added that the holidays are “a well known time for mischief” by digital troublemakers,\nbecause organizations are more thinly staffed.\n\n“It’s an optimal time to attack a major target,” she said.\n\nThe highest-profile cyberattack of a media company was in late 2014 at Sony Pictures\nEntertainment in Culver City. Hackers, which the FBI later determined were affiliated with the\nNorth Korean government, broke into Sony Pictures’ computer system and copied huge\nchunks of data, which they later posted online for the world to see.\n\n**[tony.barboza@latimes.com](https://tony.barboza@latimes.com/)**\n\n**[meg.james@latimes.com](https://meg.james@latimes.com/)**\n\n\n-----\n\n**emily.alpert@latimes.com**\n\n\n-----",
