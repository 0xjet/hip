For my Chair,\n\nColonel Parks, thank you for keeping me on point, vice allowing my thesis to digress\n\ndown a China-Taiwan rat hole, as it could have easily done. For Tim Thomas, thank you\n\nfor your inspiring books that stirred me over 5-years ago to pursue further knowledge in\n\nthis field of study. Finally, to Bob King, thank you for jumping in at the last minute to\n\nsave my paper from utter destruction.\n\nLast, but not least, to all my U.S./Singaporean Army brethren and our one token\n\nAir Force Major in Staff Group 14D, I‟ve learned more this year than I ever thought I\n\ncould. Each of you had more than a little part to do with this thesis, whether through\n\nloaning books, sharing your China-related knowledge and experiences with me,\n\nproofreading poorly written pages but encouraging me to not give up, or even arguing\n\nwith me incessantly on the validity of the term “kinetic operations.” Thank you!\n\nv\n\n\n-----\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nPage\n\nMASTER OF MILITARY

Additionally, this paper will seek to ascertain the United States\n\nmilitary‟s ability to defend and enforce our national interests, both in regards to our own\n\ndomestic infrastructures as well as our partners abroad, from Chinese-directed cyber\nattacks; with special focus given to those systems critical to the Soldier on the battlefield.\n\nFinally, the paper will evaluate legal precedent, both internationally and domestic, in\n\norder to determine viable courses of action when confronted with an escalation of force in\n\nthe Cyberspace.\n\nThere are many secondary questions which arise from the aforementioned thesis\n\nstatements, such as how will China signal intent in situations involving their cyber\nwarfare capabilities? What thresholds should be established for an appropriate military\n\nresponse and what assets or tools do we have at our disposal to respond to these threats?\n\nIf our current status or structure is insufficient, how does one propose reinforcing our\n\nU.S. Government capabilities to counter a Chinese threat?\n\nBased on the subject matter in question, it is critical first and foremost that one\n\nclearly defines two major topics that are to be repeated throughout the thesis. First, on\n\nthe term Cyberspace, Joint Publication 1-02 (as of October 2008) defines it as: A global\n\ndomain within the information environment consisting of the: interdependent network of\n\ninformation technology infrastructures, including the Internet, telecommunications\n\n1\n\n\n-----\n\nnetworks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers. (CJCS CM-0363\n08) This definition, however, is not a delimiter to the extent of what Cyberspace actually\n\nis. As such, and for the purposes of the remainder of this thesis, Cyberspace will\n\nencompass not only the actual military and civil electronics devices, but also the\n\nelectromagnetic spectrum on which the information (be it either Command, Control,\n\nCommunications, or Intelligence: C3I) travels to or from the end users. Additionally, the\n\ndomain of Cyberspace must include the medium through which the C3I travels, be it\n\nwired, wireless, or space; and the associated defenses thereof. Therefore, space-based\n\nplatforms along with their associated land-based controllers also reside in the Cyberspace\n\ndomain. Finally, Cyberspace must include the physical platforms used to store, modify,\n\nand exchange data via networked systems and associated physical infrastructures.\n\nA second critical concept to understand up front, and especially when evaluating\n\nthe likelihood of a Chinese cyber-attack is that of the assassin‟s mace (shashoujian). The\n\nPLA endeavors for high-tech gear and knowledge; their focus is on six major areas,\n\nhowever the two directly related to this thesis are: military information technology and\n\nmilitary space technology.[1] The PLA understand the role revolutions in military affairs\n\nhave played in history, and they seek to identify those new combat methods that represent\n\nChina‟s future “shock and awe;” devastating enough to deter any further U.S. military\n\naction in a crisis, but clearly decisive in its use of surprise. PLA Colonels Li Daguang\n\nand Jia Junming have both publically urged the development of an assassin‟s mace to\n\n“meet the requirements of defeating the United States in a war over Taiwan.”[2]\n\nSeveral major issues surfaced in 1999 when the PLA began incorporating\n\noffensive computer network operations (CNO) into military exercises, “primarily in first\n2\n\n\n-----\n\nstrike tactics against enemy networks.”[ 3] The Chinese government, the People‟s Republic\n\nof China (PRC), has even issued a Chinese Defense Policy white paper that confirms\n\nwhat the U.S. Government has known for some time, that “[t]he PLA is carrying out a\n\nstrategic project for training a large contingent of new-type and high-caliber military\n\npersonnel… competent for operational tasks under conditions of informationization\n\n(sic).”[4] From the U.S. perspective, in 2007 General James Cartwright, Vice Chairman of\n\nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff, has confirmed that “China is actively engaging in cyber\nreconnaissance . . . of U.S. Government agencies.”[5] Meanwhile, underground civilian\n\norganizations, from The Green Army to the likely state-sponsored Red Hacker Alliance\n\n(RHA), have participated in corporate and industrial espionage by “scanning for\n\nweaknesses in Pentagon information systems „for fun.‟”[6]\n\nThe problem with Chinese cyber-warriors is that the U.S. military relies heavily\n\non unrestricted intercommunications networks, both military-controlled as well as non\nmilitary commercial systems, so too must we ensure their proper defense. However, in\n\nthe past several years the Chinese have developed a myriad of both lethal and non-lethal\n\ncyber-weapons with the intention of denying or degrading an adversary‟s ability to use\n\nspace-based intercommunication network platforms.[7] The PRC and PLA have\n\ndemonstrated a rapid expansion of their asymmetric operations, especially in the realm of\n\nCyberspace. What courses of action does the U.S. have prepared in the event of a\n\nChinese cyber-war?\n\nThe Chinese Cyber-threat\n\nThe U.S. economy and national security are fully dependent upon information\n\ntechnology and the information infrastructure. Terrorists might attempt cyber attacks to\n\n3\n\n\n-----\n\ndisrupt critical information networks, or attempt to cause physical damage to information\n\nsystems that are integral to the operation of . . . commerce systems. Tools and\n\nmethodologies for attacking information systems are becoming widely available, and the\n\ntechnical abilities and sophistication of terrorist groups bent on causing havoc or\n\ndisruption is increasing.[8]\n\nHaving frequently been the target of several CNE attempts originating from PLA\n\ntraining centers to Beijing cyber-cafés, the U.S. has sustained damages ranging from\n\nZero-Day Exploits,[9] to Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, to Reverse Shell\n\nespionage. Unfortunately, the successful targets of such attacks have included the U.S.\n\nDepartment of Defense (DoD),[10] the U.S. Department of State,[11] and multiple private\n\nsector corporations.[12] As recently as 06 March 2009, in which Canadian researcher, Nart\n\nVilleneuve uncovered a network, dubbed GhostNet, of more than 1,200 infected\n\ncomputers worldwide which were unequivocally directed through servers located in\n\nChina (one was controlled by a Chinese government server located in Hainan Island, a\n\nknown PLAN submarine base).[13]\n\nIn addition to traditional computer targets such as the DoD‟s Non-Secure Internet\n\nProtocol Router Networks (NIPRNET), there are several non-traditional cyber-targets\n\nsuch as our U.S. satellite networks and military-grade electronic emissions that are\n\nparamount on the Chinese researcher‟s mission-set. Target sets such as these fall well\n\noutside the traditional hacker‟s capabilities. However, the PLA under their new\n\ndirectives, have been feverously developing anti-satellite capabilities of a lethal nature.\n\nFrom directed-energy (DE) high-powered microwave disruptors to free-electron and high\n\nenergy lasers,[ 14] and from the lethal demonstrations of a DF-21 missile shoot-down of one\n\n4\n\n\n-----\n\nof their own aging weather satellites[15] to the mass development of $800 briefcase-sized\n\ntransient electromagnetic devices (TED),[ 16] the face of warfare has changed.\n\nAs such, the U.S. military has made changes to expand beyond the operational\n\nconcepts of strictly independent CNO, Electronic Warfare (EW), and Space Operations to\n\ninstead be incorporated within the overarching and ethereal, but “physical,” domain of\n\nCyberspace. Not dissimilar to the domains of Land, Sea, and Air. There are now three\n\nmission areas in Cyberspace: counter-cyber operations, cross-domain operations, and\n\nsupport to civil authorities and the defense industry.[ 17]\n\nThis paper ultimately seeks to answer whether the U.S. military is capable of\n\ndefending our national interests both domestically and abroad against a cyber-attack\n\noriginating from Chinese cyber-warriors, either state sponsored or PLA-trained.\n\nUnfortunately, in this world of interdependent markets and economies on a truly global\n\nscale, those who would rely solely upon the benefits of the worldwide\n\ntelecommunications network inevitably create vulnerabilities for themselves.[18] The same\n\nholds true for the Soldier or Marine relying on Blue Force Tracker for Command and\n\nControl (C2), GPS for navigation, INMARSAT for communication, or Predator feeds for\n\nsituational awareness… or the Sailor relying on Naval Tactical Data Systems (NTDS) for\n\nover-the-horizon targeting, Bridge to Bridge (B2B) for maritime navigation, Voyage\n\nManagement System (VMS) for transit routing, or the Global Command and Control\n\nSystem (GCCS) for situational awareness and command and control (C2). While each\n\nmethod rides over different mediums and on different frequencies, each taking up\n\ndifferent quantities of bandwidth, they all reside in the aforementioned domain of\n\nCyberspace.\n\n5\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Nationalist Cyber-Terrorist\n\nThe Chinese hacker origins date back to 1994 when the Internet was first became\n\navailable to the PRC. Back then, access was severely limited to those with enough\n\nmoney to afford, and patience to endure, the 9,600 bit/sec modems. This access was\n\nfurther limited to Bulletin Board Systems, the precursor to the World Wide Web.[19]\n\nChinese restrictions on Internet access were lifted two years later; bringing the Internet\n\ninto the homes of millions. It was the following year, 1997, that the Green Army[20] was\n\nfounded. Self-proclaimed as one of China‟s earliest hacker organizations with a\n\nmembership of over 3000 people from Shanghai, Beijing, and Shijaizhuang, this\n\n“enduring symbol of the Chinese hacker movement”[21] disbanded in 2000 due to financial\n\nhardship. However, this was not before a loose quasi-coalition of confederated hackers\n\njoined forces in response to the 1998 riots in Jakarta, Indonesia.\n\nBlaming the PRC for their out of control inflation, the citizens of Indonesia\n\ndirected a massacre against their own Chinese nationals. The Chinese governments\n\nchose to filter the incident from public view, but not before the atrocities were broadcast\n\nover the Internet. Essentially, a virtual Chinese Hacker‟s Emergency Conference[22] was\n\nheld resulting in a military-type cyber-envelopment using e-mail Logic Bombs. Postings\n\non many major Indonesian websites included such:\n\nYour site has been hacked by a group of hackers from China. Indonesian thugs,\n\nthere can be retribution for your atrocities, stop slaughtering the Chinese people.[23]\n\nSeeing this as a viable, non-lethal alternative to protracted conflicts, the PRC\n\nbegan emphasizing a concept of Comprehensive National Power[24] whereby both the\n\nmilitary and the civilian roles become integrated on behalf of the nation. State\n6\n\n\n-----\n\nsponsored, but civilian, organizations quickly and gladly assumed the role of protector of\n\nnational interests. Chinese hacker groups such as the Honker Union of China, the Red\n\nHacker Alliance, and the Chinese Red Guest Network Security Technology Alliance\n\nwould seek out targets of opportunity to attack.[ 25] It was therefore only a matter of time\n\nbefore the U.S. Armed Forces became the targets of their coordinated wrath.\n\nIn 1999, after U.S. planes bombed Beijing‟s embassy in Belgrade, Chinese\n\nhackers quickly commenced cyber-battles with their respective U.S. counterparts.[ 26] In\n\n2001, following the mid-air collision of a U.S. EP-3 and a Chinese AN-124 on April 1st,\n\nthe ensuing political conflict between the two powers prompted Chinese nationalists to\n\nrise up once again. Hackers soon after organized a massive week-long campaign of\n\ncyber-attacks against over 1200 U.S. sites to include the White House, U.S. Air Force,\n\nDepartment of Energy, Department of Labor, and Department of Health and Human\n\nServices.[ 27]\n\nAssumptions\n\nThere are several assumptions that must be presented up front if we are to\n\npresume this thesis to be valid. First, the PRC has actively exploited the Microsoft Office\n\nsource codes with the malicious intent of using them against the United States\n\nGovernment. Additionally the PRC sees cyber-warfare a first-strike option and is\n\ntraining and equipping the PLA in the conduct of such. With regards to Chinese\n\n“hacktivism,” despite the fact that DoD and security officials remain divided over (1)\n\nwhether the known cyber-attacks are coordinated or sponsored by the Chinese\n\ngovernment, (2) whether they are the work of individual and independent hackers, or (3)\n\nwhether the cyber-attacks are being initiated by some third-party organization that is\n\n7\n\n\n-----\n\nusing network servers in China to disguise the true origins of the attacks, this thesis must\n\nassume at a minimum that the PRC is either fully aware of their existence or actually\n\nprovides the mechanisms for their actions through either financial, informational, or via\n\nprotection of those non-military individuals with the specific intent that they continue to\n\nconduct both Computer Network Exploitations (CNEs) and CNAs against the U.S.\n\nGovernment.\n\nLimitations\n\nIn limiting the depth of this thesis, the focus will primarily be on those cyber\nactivities between the U.S. and China when not involved in an official state of war or\n\ninvolved in undeclared conflict. That implies that the thesis will not cover those PRC\n\nactivities intended to assist non-state actors through funding, intelligence, or protection\n\nby the PRC and whose cyber-goals are operations intended to probe or attack the U.S. In\n\naddition, it will not evaluate the use of force by the U.S. military against recreational\n\nhackers, terrorists, or organized cyber-criminals as those comprise a law enforcement\n\nissue which must be addressed through bilateral extradition vice military action.\n\nAnother limitation is that all discussions will be restricted to actions initiated from\n\nwithin the borders of China. Therefore, U.S.-originated domestic cyber-activities will not\n\nbe included; this consists of those domestic actions that are of direct assistance in a\n\ncoordinated Chinese cyber-attack. Domestic CNE, again even in direct support of a\n\ncoordinated Chinese cyber-attack, will also not be discussed because it is a domestic law\n\nenforcement issue. Neither will any other aspect of Information Operations (IO, Military\n\nDeception, Psychological Operation, or Operational Security) be discussed with the\n\nexception of how cyber-activities can be used to support IO.\n\n8\n\n\n-----\n\nBackground: Taiwan and the Prelude to Cyber-War\n\nIt would be a stretch to imply that current cyber-tensions between the U.S. and\n\nChina are simply due to the continued existence of the island-nation of Taiwan.\n\nHowever, it would also be a mistake to completely dismiss the events which have shaped\n\nthe environment in the Far East since World War II. That said, in 1949 the former leader\n\nof China, Chiang Kai-shek, fled mainland China and relocated the Republic of China‟s\n\n(ROC) seat of government to the island of Taiwan, formerly known as Formosa. Kai\nshek continued to claim sovereignty over all of mainland China from his island-hideout\n\nin Taipei, Taiwan.\n\nMainland China, however, had other plans for the island following the Chinese\n\nCivil War in 1949, in which the victorious Communist Party of China gained complete\n\ncontrol under Mao Zedong. Mao moved to establish the People‟s Republic of China\n\n(PRC) and claim sole representation of China to include Taiwan, to which Zedung would\n\nassert, was illegitimately led.[28] Taiwan remained under martial law from 1948 until\n\n1987, when Chiang Kai-shek‟s eventual successor, Lee Teng-hui, began the gradual\n\ndemocratization and liberalization of the ROC‟s governmental system. However, it was\n\nthen that the controversial issues surrounding the political status of the Taiwanese\n\ngovernment resurfaced. Beginning with the banking system, Teng-hui authorized the\n\nprinting of banknotes from the Central Bank rather than the Provincial Bank of Taiwan.\n\nSoon after, President Teng-hui forced the disbanding of the Taiwan Provincial\n\nGovernment as well as demanding the resignations of the Legislative Yuan and National\n\nAssembly . . . both of whom were established in 1947 to represent mainland Chinese\n\n9\n\n\n-----\n\nconstituencies. Finally, Teng-hui lifted all restrictions on the use of the Taiwanese\n\nlanguage in both broadcasting and schools.\n\nThis entire discussion of Taiwan, to include their assertions of sovereignty from\n\nmainland China, ultimately resulted in one of the most significant military standoffs\n\ninvolving the U.S. and China. The root cause stemmed from a simple visit to Cornell\n\nUniversity by the President of Taiwan, Lee Teng-hui. The People‟s Republic of China\n\n(PRC) took this visit as a serious affront to their communist-orthodox definition of what\n\nTaiwan‟s place in the world was. The PRC had expected that then-President Bill Clinton\n\nwould block Lee‟s visit for the betterment of U.S.-China relations, but he did not. China\n\nvery soon thereafter became engaged in a series of aggressive military demonstrations\n\ninvolving the firing of 6 ballistic missiles impacting just 80 miles off the Taiwanese\n\ncoast. President Clinton understood that he could no longer assume peace in the Taiwan\n\nStraits and that the seemingly innocent visit had triggered deep emotional reactions\n\nbetween the two sides, with the U.S. in the middle.[29]\n\nBelieving power-projection to be the appropriate response to PRC aggression,\n\nU.S. leaders ordered two U.S. carrier strike groups to maneuver between the narrow\n\nwaters separating Taiwan from mainland China--the Taiwan Straits. Lee sought to\n\nreassure the PRC that he did not intend to declare independence; Clinton sought to\n\nconvince the PRC that we wanted to retain good relations with China, however, he was\n\nready to defend Taiwan if needed.\n\n1Frederic Vellucci, Collins Ferguson, Daniel Hartnett, and Kenneth Allen, The Science of PLA\n_Training: Analysis and Overview of PLA Training Theory (Center for Naval Analysis, China Studies,_\nFebruary 2009), 132-133.\n\n10\n\n\n-----\n\n2Michael P.

To shape this effort, Chapter 2 will introduce in detail a myriad of literature\n\ncovering the three main cyber-threats originating from China (again, recalling that this\n\nthesis will not evaluate recreational hacktivists) ; these are the People‟s Republic of\n\nChina, the PLA, and the state-sponsored Chinese nationalist (or Honker). Each will be\n\ncovered in the sub-chapter of China on China.\n\nThe paper, more importantly, seeks to ascertain our ability to defend and enforce\n\nour national interests, both in regards to our own domestic infrastructures, as well as our\n\npartners abroad, from Chinese-directed cyber-attacks. To that end, this chapter will also\n\ncover the current legal implications both domestically and internationally with regards to\n\nthe U.S. military and their use of force in Cyberspace. Additionally, the literature review\n\nwill also incorporate those specific national interests that would require defending with\n\nrespect to Cyberspace both domestically and abroad.\n\nChapter 2 is broken down in three distinct sub-chapters representing either their\n\nauthor‟s predominant point of view or their primary literature‟s focus and they are\n\nlabeled: China on China, United States‟ Perception of China, and finally, United States\n\non the United States. This holistic approach is intended to not only satisfy the\n\nrequirement of a literature review, but also to shape the reader‟s understanding as to the\n\ndepth and give the reader insight into the complex nature that is Cyberspace.\n\n13\n\n\n-----\n\nChina on China\n\nThis sub-chapter will review the literature originating from within the borders of\n\nChina and specifically those books or articles covering such topics as the leadership\n\nwithin the PRC and the guiding Generals within the PLA who execute their direction.\n\nFirst of all, it is important to note that the PLA publishing system consists of 28\n\npublishing houses; 16 newspapers (such as PLA Daily); and hundreds of periodicals[1]\n\n(such as China Militia and China Air Force). Their breadth represents an essential\n\ncomponent of the PLA‟s ability to function as an institution. Unfortunately, for the\n\npurposes of research, it is important to note that the PLA publishing system has also been\n\nused to exercise political control and disseminate propaganda to both the Chinese\n\npopulation as well as to the rest of the world, to maintain organizational cohesion\n\namongst the PLA services, to reform and modernize their officer corps through\n\nprofessional development, and to serve as civil-military proxy between the civilian\n\npopulation and the PLA that are tasked to defend them[2]. The PLA leadership views\n\npropaganda as a capability through which they can externalize their “soft power” while\n\ncountering negative criticism as this PLA Daily _(Jiefangjun Bao) article states that_\n\npropaganda is “an important channel through which the PLA can improve its soft power\n\nand display the good image of the Chinese soldiers.”[3]\n\n14\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. The seven Chinese Military Regions\nSource: Wikipedia, http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:China%E2%80%99s_\nMilitary_Regions.png (accessed on 18 March 2009).\n\nAll books and articles--even those written by military subject matter experts--are\n\nstill vetted through the General Political Department (the GPD, who incidentally also\n\noversees the Propaganda Department) who supervises, or censors, each publication\n\nbefore going into the PLA publishing system. Therefore, while the quantity of usable\n\ninformation specific to the thesis topic seems to be limited, it is actually the credibility of\n\nthe information found in PLA books and publications that is of greatest concern.\n\n15\n\n\n-----\n\nPLA on Unrestricted Warfare\n\nRarely, a whole book manages to either circumvent the GPD vetting process, or is\n\nintentionally released for psychological purposes in an effort to satisfy United Nations\n\n(U.N.) Resolution 35/142B (Military Transparency). One such book, Unrestricted\n\n_Warfare (超限战, literally \"warfare beyond bounds\") was initially published by the PLA_\n\nLiterature and Arts Publishing House in Beijing (Figure 1), and therefore suggests that it\n\nwas endorsed at least by some elements of the PLA leadership. It is a book on military\n\nstrategy that was authored, in part, as a response to the PLA‟s fascination with our\n\nsuccesses in the first Gulf War. Written in 1999 by two colonels in from the PLAAF,\n\nQiao Liang (乔良) and Wang Xiangsui (王湘穗), it reveals how China believes it can\n\novercome our military‟s technological advantages and defeat the U.S. through a myriad\n\nof “total warfares;” the two of which most directly apply to this thesis: technology\n\nwarfare and network warfare. However, Qiao and Wang are not so rudimentary as to\n\nstop there. They go on to overtly imply, for example, that the attacking side of two\n\ndeveloped nations might employ strictly military force-on-force techniques that\n\nincorporate “satellite reconnaissance, electronic countermeasures, large-scale air attack\n\nplus precision attacks, ground outflanking, amphibious landings, [and] air drops behind\n\nenemy lines.”[4] Contrary to the force-on-force, they suggest a better alternative in the\n\nform of a “combination method” that includes not only military techniques, but also\n\ntrans-military and non-military capabilities. They therefore suggest that:\n\nIf the attacking side secretly musters large amounts of capital without the enemy\nnation being aware of this at all and launches a sneak attack against its financial\nmarkets, then after causing a financial crisis, buries a computer virus and hacker\ndetachment in the opponent‟s computer system in advance, while at the same time\ncarrying out a network attack against the enemy so that the civilian electricity\n\n16\n\n\n-----\n\nnetwork, traffic network, and mass media network are completely paralyzed, this\nwill cause the enemy nation to fall into social panic, street riots, and a political\ncrisis.[5]\n\nThis example ends with the attacking military force bearing down on the\n\nvanquished foe until a “dishonorable peace treaty” is signed. This is the crux of\n\n_Unrestricted Warfare and the Chinese cyber-warrior represents the first in a line of viable_\n\n“combinations” that can be used against the U.S. and her allies.\n\nFinally, with respect to “Unrestricted Warfare,” Qiao and Wang proceed to\n\ndescribe “kinder weapons” to which they suggests a tank‟s combat capabilities can be\n\nhard destroyed with either a missile or cannon, however, a kinder option would be to\n\ndestroy its optical equipment with a directed energy weapon. Under kinder weapons, he\n\nsuggests that there are two flavors: “hard destruction” as in an electro-magnetic pulse\n\n(EMP), and reversible “soft-strikes” as in computer logic bombs, network viruses, or\n\nDDoS attack. “Both [he claimed] are focused on paralyzing and undermining, not\n\npersonnel casualties.”[6]\n\nPLA on Information Operations\n\nEssentially, the “Research on Information Warfare Issues in Our Military”\n\n(Wojun Xinxizhan Wenti Yanjiu) is a compilation of some of China‟s most prominent\n\nInformation Operations theories and practices as they apply to the PLA. Its editor, Peng\n\nChencang, pulled from several dozen experts, however, none as prominent or outspoken\n\nas then-Major General Dai Qingmin. Dai elaborated on the exploitation of the Battlefield\n\nInformation Environment (BIE) to gain combat advantage. He goes on to assert that\n\nthere are three elements that compose the BIE; they are the fields of electromagnetism,\n\n17\n\n\n-----\n\ncomputers and their networks, and human society (which will not be covered in this\n\nthesis).\n\nDai claimed that it is the electromagnetic field, which he also coined as the “main\n\nfield,” in which BIE exists. He also asserted that in future combat, China will face an\n\nelectromagnetic signal space with denser and more complex signals. For example, he\n\nlists not only the electromagnetic waves, but also light and sound waves as well. On the\n\ntopic of computers and their associated networks, Dai believed that on future battlefields\n\nthere will become a huge reliance on both the information processing and dissemination\n\nvia Cyberspace; resulting in new types of combat such as “hacker warfare, network\n\nwarfare, and computer virus warfare.”[7] This all seems very rudimentary, that is until Dai\n\nexplains how the BIE has its own unique characteristics and capabilities, thereafter\n\nmimicking the sentiments of Qiao and Wang‟s Unrestricted Warfare once again.\n\nIn Unrestricted Warfare the reader is introduced to the concept of “combination\n\nmethods” in which an enemy nation could be met with not only cyber-warfare, but also\n\ndiplomatic, financial, trade, drug, terrorist, ideological, and even ecological warfare. Dai,\n\nin his submission echoes these sentiments by overtly bringing in the factor of “domestic\n\ncombat information systems” (or nationalist Chinese “Hacktivists”) into the fold. Dai\n\nclaims that within the information era the “fusing and sharing of military and commercial\n\ninformation facilities and technologies [so that] the boundaries between military, non\nmilitary, global and BIE will gradually become ambiguous.”[8] Dai describes pieces of\n\nChina‟s possible Course of Action (COA) utilizing what can only be construed again as\n\nChinese nationalists by conducting an “invasion, attack, and damage of enemy classified\n\n18\n\n\n-----\n\ninformation networks [using either] opposing military organizations (PLA) or from an\n\nunknown hacker with no association to any government.”[9]\n\nDai, without directly saying either the U.S. or Taiwan, successfully calls out both\n\nnations:\n\n…whether for counter-invasion warfare or unification or the motherland, we will\nstand our ground in homeland combat. Contrary to the enemy, which will\nundergo a long mobilization away from home, we have the factor of convenience\nin utilizing the foundational information facilities . . . all can be converted for\nmilitary use in wartime.[10]\n\nDai expounds on this rhetoric just one year later when he called upon uniting\n\ncivilian and the PLA under a single common telecom system to meet both peacetime and\n\nwartime needs. In Dai‟s “Innovating and Developing Views on Information Operations”\n\nhe defines the “target” as the military information and information systems, and the\n\n“principal form[s]” encompassing both EW and CNO. He also emphasized that future\n\noperations must be integrated, meaning both military and civilian fighting forces.\n\nFinally, Dai lays out ten cyber-stratagems as follows: plant information mines, conduct\n\ninformation reconnaissance, changing network data, releasing information bombs,\n\ndumping information garbage, disseminating propaganda, applying information\n\ndeception, releasing clone information, organizing information defense, and establishing\n\nnetwork spy stations.[11]\n\nPLA in Chinese Periodicals\n\nThe PLA Daily _(Jiefangjun Bao) and China National Defense News are the only_\n\ntwo PLA newspapers designated and written specifically for public consumption\n\n(gongkai; 公开). Public distribution of these newspapers began in 1987, with the goal of\n\ngiving the general public the opportunity to read about PLA affairs in a state-sponsored\n\n19\n\n\n-----\n\npublication. Since then, this goal has been furthered by the introduction of Internet\n\neditions, such as the PLA Daily online edition, which is also available to the Chinese\n\npublic.[12] In a March 2007 PLA Daily Online article, the former-director of the Chinese\n\nPLA Communications Department and current director of the PLA‟s Advisory\n\nCommittee for Informationalization, Major General Dai Qingmin (a known advocate of\n\nthe pre-emptive cyber-attack to gain the initiative and seize information superiority[13])\n\nwas interviewed on both network and national security. During the interview he revealed\n\nthe development of computer operating systems that are completely self-dominated and\n\nfree of intellectual property rights (an open sourced Linux-style operating system, for\n\nexample) as well as the development of an internal (military) professional training\n\nsystem[14] relating to the topic of “informationalization” (sic).\n\nOver the past several years, PLA Daily has, along with several other well-read\n\nChinese periodicals, documented the growth and development of their armed forces. For\n\nexample, since post 9/11, the Hong Kong Journal began an in depth analysis of the\n\nTaiwanese “Hankuang 18” exercises. This 2002 journal emphasized Taiwan‟s\n\nparticipation in a computer network warfare training exercise codenamed “Lusheng II.”\n\nThe PLA General Staff Department quickly directed relevant combat units of the PLA to\n\nstudy and analyze the “Lusheng II” warfare tactics, and to come up with countermeasures\n\nas quickly as possible. However, the same article backs current Chinese research and\n\ndevelopment by reminding their readers of three main points: first, the China‟s maturing\n\nsatellite technology with surveillance and future positioning capabilities; second, the\n\nestablishment of specialized IW units tasked with both developing computer viruses to\n\nsabotage enemy computer systems as well as guarding the PLA‟s computer systems; and\n\n20\n\n\n-----\n\nfinally, the development of institutions of higher learning with regards to IW, such as the\n\nPLA Information Engineering University, which had at the time “developed unique\n\ncharacteristics in . . . information security . . . telecommunications engineering . . . and\n\nspace information and surveying technology”[15]\n\nChinese periodicals have also indicated a vested interest by the PLA in counter\nreconnaissance and active surveillance jamming techniques. The first of these deception\n\nmeans, counter-reconnaissance, involves passively applying advanced camouflage\n\ntechniques coupled with natural environmental conditions to defeat U.S. reconnaissance\n\nsystems. While this is not a traditional application of PLA cyber-warriors, their efforts\n\nsignal intent to develop passive asymmetric counter-Cyberspace means. For example,\n\nthe Jinan Military Region (MR, Figure 1) held their region‟s Winter Field Training\n\nexercise in 2007 where all three armies (20th, 26th, and 54th) held counter\nreconnaissance drills against “high-tech reconnaissance means.”[16] The PLA Daily\n\ncovered the same period, focusing on the 54th Group Army. The 54th carried out\n\ninnovative, although questionably useful, countermeasures such as road-side dispersals,\n\ncreating smoke screens, hiding in ravines, and even intermixing with civilian tragic on\n\nhighways.[17]\n\nDuring times of war or national emergency, War Zone Headquarters (WZHQ)\n\nwill be established based primarily on the Military Regions (Figure 1). The WZHQ will\n\nhave command of all forces in all branches of service in their respective regions. Similar\n\nto U.S. military operations, the PLA divides military operations into phases according to\n\nterrain, task, or time (reminiscent of Milan Vego‟s: space, force, time). Dennis J. Blasko\n\nexplains in his 2006 The Chinese Army Today that WZHQ, beyond traditional military\n\n21\n\n\n-----\n\nunits, may employ local forces (People‟s Armed Police), as well as militia augmented by\n\ncivilian forces[18] (which does not preclude the nationalist cyber-warriors). PLA Daily, in\n\n2007, covered the PLAAF‟s enlistment of their militia in the Tangshan Military\n\nSubdistrict (Beijing MR, Figure 1) to assist in camouflaging air defense positions. In this\n\ncase, the militia also used dubious means to obscure their adversary‟s bomb damage\n\nassessment, which included fire, lights, smoke, and electronics to “hide or transform the\n\nshape of important infrastructures, such as oil depots, power plants, and bridges.”[19]\n\nThe second deception means, active surveillance jamming techniques, certainly\n\nfall within the domain of Cyberspace. In an interview with Bingqi Zhishi an “expert”\n\nsuggested that it was possible to electronically jam the telemetry control signal between\n\nground control and surveillance satellites. Taiwan‟s Taipei Times reported in 2006 that\n\nChinese have already developed a form of laser dazzling and have used that technique on\n\nU.S. military satellites.[20]\n\nOn issues of electronic warfare (EW), however, the Chinese research and\n\ndevelopment has clearly recognized the increasingly greater role that both EW and\n\nelectronic counter measures (ECM) play in a modern warfare. In the Chengdu MR\n\n(Figure 1), experiments are still ongoing to test and evaluate the jamming effectiveness\n\nfrom the jamming side. In an article published in the Dianzi Xinxi Juikang Jishu, several\n\nrenowned scientists and scholars challenged the traditional jamming parameters of\n\nmeasuring signal-to-noise interference ratio at the receiver, max transmission range at the\n\ntransmitter site, detection zone (specifically for radar systems), the suppression\n\ncoefficient, the discover probability, and the deceit probability.[21] Instead, they propose\n\nthat this method is only effective in a field test situation and is essentially worthless in a\n\n22\n\n\n-----\n\nwar as “the jamming side cannot possibly obtain these evaluation data on the enemy…\n\ndirectly.”[22] The authors, Li Chao and Zhou Jinquan, are research scientists for the\n\nMissile Institute of Air Force Engineering University and the Military Academy of the\n\nPLA, respectively. So their insight and analysis most-closely resembles what one should\n\nexpect to encounter when facing and informationalized PLA.\n\nThe aforementioned periodical also published an article on the “Multi-Signal\n\nJamming Technology in [a] Complex Environment” written by Li Dongxin, a researcher\n\nfrom the National Keu Lab of Information Integrated Control in the Chengdu MR (Figure\n\n1). In it, Dongxin reviews the two main radar jamming technologies used for PLA ECM:\n\nmulti-pulse velocity-range decoys and multi-pulsed false target jamming. Either\n\ntechnique is intended to target a pulsed-Doppler radar system‟s (the non-phased array\n\nsystems still used by our military forces) capability to not only detect target location\n\n(bearing, range, and altitude) but also a target‟s radial velocity (range-rate). Specifically,\n\nDongxin‟s conclusion is that in an increasingly complex multi-signal environment, ECM\n\nequipment has no choice but to make fundamental improvements.[23]\n\nFinally, on the topic of direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) signals, the same\n\nperiodical published an article on “DSSS Signal Parameter Estimation” written by Chen\n\nXiming and Huang Shuoyi. In it they admit that both detection and parameter\n\nestimations have become a difficult problem, especially as they relate to jamming.\n\nUnfortunately, this form of digital communication serves an essential role in both U.S.\n\nmilitary (GPS and Galileo) and civilian (CDMA, LRCP, 802.11b, etc) purposes. DSSS\n\nprovides secured communications, multi-address communications, and satellite\n\nnavigation and location. Ximing and Shouyi ultimately assert that one of the key steps in\n\n23\n\n\n-----\n\nconducting non-cooperative communications (or simply electronic surveillance, ES) is to\n\n“obtain signal modulation parameters, code period, chip rate, and carrier wave\n\nfrequency.”[24]\n\nOn the topic of the most recent scandal, the blatant and highly publicized Chinese\n\ncyber-spying via zombie U.S. and Chinese servers, also known as GhostNet, China\n\nquickly countered through a myriad of publications. First, in the most widely read China\n\nDaily, military analyst and Beijing-based strategist Song Xiaojun claimed that “this [was]\n\npurely another political issue that the West is trying to exaggerate [and] as China grows,\n\nsome in the West are trying every opportunity to manufacture fears over China‟s\n\nthreat.”[25] Second, in an interview with Professor Zhu Feng, from the School of\n\nInternational Studies in Peking noted that “cyber security has been a global issue . . .\n\nthose who see China as an emerging threat again [have] picked the new subject as a\n\nweapon.”[26] Finally, in Beijing‟s Global Times (Huanqiu Shibao) information security\n\nexpert, Qiu Feng, pointed out that “. . . creating such a huge network and (sic) organizing\n\npersonnel and coordinating attacks in different countries is not an easy matter. . . . This\n\nstory is full of loopholes. There is insufficient evidence to say that China has such a huge\n\noverseas spy network.”[27]\n\nUnited States‟ Perception of China\n\n[The] goal of a space shock and awe strike is [to] deter the enemy, not to provoke\nthe enemy into combat. For this reason, the objectives selected for strike must be\nfew and precise . . . [for example] on important information sources, command\nand control centers, communications hubs, and other objectives. This will shake\nthe structure of the opponent‟s operational system of organization and will create\nhuge psychological impact on the opponent‟s policymakers.[28]\n\n-- Colonel Zelu,, PLA, National Defense University\n\n24\n\n\n-----\n\nThe PRC‟s interpretation with respect to what constitutes either an attack or the\n\nlegitimate use of force is vague at best. In the 2008 Annual Report to Congress on the\n\nMilitary Power of the People‟s Republic of China (ARC 2008), we are reminded of\n\nChina‟s history (Korean War, 1950-1953; Indian conflict, 1962; Soviet conflict, 1969;\n\nVietnam, 1973) in which they charge their PLA with either the preemptive or coercive\n\nuse of force in an effort to advance their own core interests. The ARC 2008 overtly\n\nimplied that Chinese precedent demonstrates their territorial claims on Taiwan, quoting\n\nChinese Military theory “if any country or organization violates the other country‟s\n\nsovereignty and territorial integrity, the other side will have the right to „fire the first\n\nshot‟ on the plane of tactics.”[29]\n\nThe ARC 2008 goes on to include vague references to China‟s “Assassin‟s Mace”\n\n(shashoujian) Programs in which part of the PLA‟s asymmetric warfighting strategy is to\n\nuse programs designed to give technologically inferior militaries advantages over\n\ntechnologically superior adversaries. Since 1999, the ARC 2008 notes, the term has\n\nappeared more frequently in PLA journals. Although not clearly specified in the ARC\n\n2008, China‟s “Assassin‟s Mace” would likely be a mixture of old and new technologies\n\napplied in unique ways, “particularly in the context of fighting the United States in a\n\nTaiwan conflict.”[30]\n\nU.S. on the Modernization of the PLA with respect to CNO\n\nOn CNO, the 2008‟s Report to Congress from the U.S.-China Economic and\n\n_Security Review Commission (USCC 2008) acknowledges the critical vulnerability of the_\n\nU.S. Government and economy due to our heavy dependence on the Internet. As such,\n\n25\n\n\n-----\n\nthe USCC 2008 presumes that China will likely seek to take advantage of this U.S.\n\nreliance due to the following assessments:\n\n1) The costs of Cyberspace operations are low in comparison with traditional\nespionage or military activities.\n2) Determining the origin of cyber-operations and attributing them to the\nChinese government or any other operator is difficult; hindering our response.\n3) Cyber-attacks can be used to confuse us, the enemy.\n4) There is an underdeveloped legal framework to guide responses\n\nAs such, China is very likely to continue pursuing CNO capabilities that may\n\nprovide them with an asymmetric advantage against the U.S.\n\nAs noted by Wang and Qiao in Unrestricted Warfare, China‟s perception of U.S.\n\nsuccess in the first Gulf War led to a growing number of CNO advocates amongst PLA\n\nofficials. Mark A. Stokes from the Strategic Studies Institute, and former U.S. military\n\nattaché in Beijing, wrote back in 1999 on the Chinese enthusiasm and the concurrence\n\nthat called for the development of weapons systems that can “throw the financial system\n\nand army command systems of the hegemonists (sic) into chaos.” Stokes goes on to note\n\nthat technological weapons of this nature provide an asymmetric advantage for an\n\nunderdeveloped country to use against a nation which is “extremely fragile and\n\nvulnerable when it fulfills the process of networking and then relies entirely on electronic\n\ncomputers.”[31] PLA strategists, according to Stokes, have thus increased their emphasis on\n\ncomputer warfare and have expanded to include the feasibility of introducing computer\n\nviruses (bingdu) via wireless means. Stokes‟ assessment, written at the same time that\n\n_Unrestricted Warfare was published mimics the sentiments of Wang and Qiao on_\n\ncombined warfare with specificity towards Financial Warfare + Network Warfare.\n\n26\n\n\n-----\n\nChina‟s most recent cyber-snooping escapade painted the PRC into the proverbial\n\ncorner as the Canadian researcher, Nart Villeneuve, learned about the GhostNet\n\ninfiltration network through the use of honey-pots. Toronto‟s The Globe and Mail\n\nrevealed how Villeneuve‟s “honey-pot” computers were taken over. Mysterious entities\n\nsought to reveal the honey-pots‟ processor speed, memory specifications, geographic\n\ninformation as to its location, „My Documents‟ files, and finally given an instruction to\n\ndownload a copy of the GhostNet remote-access tool. Villeneuve‟s evidence showed that\n\nthe majority of the “control servers were located in China . . . [and] the interface to\n\ncontrol the infected hosts on these servers in China was in Chinese,” and finally, the\n\n“remote Trojan favoured (sic) by the attackers is a Trojan coded by Chinese hackers.”[32]\n\nHowever, most disturbing of all was neither Chinese servers nor the Chinese-coded\n\nTrojans; rather, the high value targets which include none other than Deloitte & Touche,\n\nemployer of over 165,000 professional in 140 countries delivering audit, tax, consulting,\n\nand financial advisory services through its member firms.[33] Recalling Qiao and Wang‟s\n\nsuggestion presented in Unrestricted Warfare of using a combined warfare, such as\n\nnetwork warfare with financial warfare.\n\nU.S. on the Modernization of the PLA with Respect to EW\n\nChinese research and development clearly recognizes the greater role that\n\nelectronic warfare plays on the informationalization of their PLA. U.S. literature also\n\nrecognizes that Chinese leaders have prompted to accelerate the modernization of their\n\narmed forces. For example, the Center for Strategic and International Studies published\n\n_Chinese Military Modernization in 2007, which emphasized the PLA force development_\n\nand strategic capabilities. As such, there is significant concentration in the development\n\n27\n\n\n-----\n\nof the PLA‟s technological base with emphasis on C4ISR.[34] This statement is supported\n\nin the U.S. DoD Annual Estimates of Information Warfare Capabilities and Commitment\n\nof the PRC 2002-2009 where the author, Dr. Kabay, highlights the PLA‟s objective to\n\nseize electromagnetic dominance. He described the combination of electronic warfare,\n\nCNO, and lethal strikes as Integrated Network Electronic Warfare (INEW).\n\nU.S. on the Modernization of the PLA with Respect to ASAT and Space\n\nThe ARC 2008 noted that China has developed significant ASAT capabilities that\n\ngo far beyond those demonstrated by the direct-ascent shoot down of January 2007. They\n\ninclude co-orbital kinetic weapons, directed energy weapons (both of which are still\n\nunder development) and micro-satellites. China is also developing electronic attack and\n\nCNO techniques targetting an adversary‟s space assets as well as its ground support\n\nnetworks. Finally, the ARC 2008 believes that the PLA consider „„battlefield situational\n\nawareness‟‟ so critical to modern combat operations that the development of an offensive\n\n“Assassin‟s Mace” weapon, specifically with space attack capability is required.\n\nIn an effort to counter our national interests in space, the PLA has developed\n\nmulti-dimensional space programs focused on limiting or preventing the use of satellite\nbased assets by their potential adversaries during times of conflict.[35] Designed to exploit\n\na number of susceptible space assets, their research and development fall into two basic\n\ncategories of lethal-kill methods: either directed-energy or direct-ascent. Non-lethal\n\nmethods, however, targets one of two specific subcomponents of an adversary‟s space\n\ncollection capabilities: imagery collection, or signals intelligence (SIGINT) collection.\n\nThe Chinese have even expanding their CNO initiatives to include activities that threaten\n\nthe DoD‟s space control and supporting computer networks, thus posing a significant risk\n\n28\n\n\n-----\n\nto critical U.S. warfighting systems. Thankfully, U.S. military satellite communications\n\nspace assets are physically hardened or software protected in an effort to counter such\n\nvulnerabilities… unfortunately, however, few of the U.S. military‟s commercially-leased\n\nsystems share this level of hardening.[36] Thus, this brings China‟s space capabilities and\n\nmilitarized intentions to a level of U.S. national interest, and the aforementioned threat to\n\nour security and prosperity of our nation as a whole.\n\nAlthough the PRC has never publically acknowledged a dedicated anti-satellite\n\n(ASAT) program, the PLA has been intently interested in building the capacity to deny,\n\ndegrade, deceive, disrupt, delay, corrupt and even destroy their adversaries‟ use of space\n\nbased satellite platforms and their associated systems. The research and development to\n\nachieve this has been ongoing since the 1960s; likely assisted by Mao Tse Tung‟s mid\n1950s ABMD rhetoric. Under their anti-ballistic missile defense (ABMD) 640 Program\n\nof 1963, the PRC made their first attempts to build a system consisting of a lethal “kill”\n\nvehicle, high powered lasers, and a space indications and warnings (I&W) network[37].\n\nAlthough the ABMD 640 Program was abandoned in the 1980‟s, the technology\n\ndeveloped set the stage for transition into China‟s High Technology Development 863\n\nProgram under Deng Xiaoping.\n\nDr. Michael Pillsbury, a Senior Fellow for the Atlantic Council of the U.S. and\n\nAssociate Fellow for the National Strategic Studies Asian Affairs, authored An\n\n_Assessment of China‟s Anti-Satellite and Space Warfare Program in 2007. Although his_\n\nassessment was not submitted to the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review\n\nCommission until a week after the Chinese ASAT incident of 2007, the depth and\n\nbreadth to which Pillsbury shaped the space environment cannot be dismissed. He\n\n29\n\n\n-----\n\nidentifies the PLA‟s need to develop a covert space warfare operations as well as the\n\nneed for the PRC to build a “Space Army.” Capabilities of which, Pillsbury specified,\n\ninclude a space-based ASAT network, ship and submarine-launched direct ascent ASAT\n\ncapabilities, plasma attacks against low-earth orbit (LEO) satellites, and space electronic\n\njamming.[38]\n\nDomestically, current U.S. DoD Space Policy is governed by and nested under the\n\nNational Space policy of August 2006 and focuses primarily on the operational\n\ncapabilities enabling our military services to fulfill their respective national security\n\nspace objectives. Both documents view space as a medium through which military\n\noperations can take place--similar to the domains of land, sea, or air. As such, it falls\n\nwithin our national interests to ensure space support, force enhancement, space control,\n\nand force application continues unimpeded.[39]\n\nDirect Ascent and Micro-Satellite ASATs\n\n. . . the offensive capabilities in space should, if necessary, be capable of\ndestroying or temporarily incapacitating all enemy space vehicles that fly in space\nabove our sovereign territory[ 40]\n\n-- Colonel Li Daguang, PLA 2001\n\nChina‟s interpretation of the “peaceful use of space” (as delineated in the Outer\n\nSpace treaty of 1967) is clearly inconsistent with their development of the PLA space\n\nweapons programs. As early as 2001, rhetoric concerning the development of an\n\noffensive “Assassin‟s Mace” weapon, specifically with space attack capability, began\n\ncirculating. Colonel Li Daguang makes the particular point that “the offensive capability\n\nin space should . . . be capable of destroying . . . all enemy space vehicles that fly in space\n\nabove our sovereign territory.”[41] Later that year the PRC launched the Tsinghua-1, their\n\n30\n\n\n-----\n\nfirst 50 kg micro-satellite, revealing the Kaituozhe-1 (KT-1 Space Launch Vehicle\n\n(SLV)) solid-fuel rocket and mobile LEO launch vehicle (Figure 2).\n\nThe January 2007 test of a direct-ascent ASAT weapon, for example, in which\n\nthey confirmed the PLA‟s ability to destroy satellites operating in a LEO, demonstrated\n\nthe culmination of years of research and development on their part. The target was an\n\naging Chinese FY-1C weather satellite operating in polar orbit at over 500 miles above\n\nthe earth. Pentagon officials would later identify the ASAT with the designator “SC-19”\n\nand based on the KT-1 SLV. Although this was their third attempt to destroy the same\n\nFY-1C satellite, their success confirms they have the capability to compromise the\n\ncontinued operation of many of our LEO ISR platforms used for collection and\n\ncounterterrorism.[42] Additionally, the debris field formed by said ASAT has the potential\n\nto directly compromise the nearly 400 U.S. LEO satellites over the next 20 years.\n\n31\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2. China's KT series of SLVs. The missile used in the January 2007 Chinese\nASAT test is likely to have been a KT-1 (right).\n_Source: Richard Fisher from the International Assessment and Strategy Center, China‟s_\nDirect Ascent ASAT, 20 January 2007. http://www.strategycenter.net/research/\npubID.142/pub_detail.asp (accessed 18 March 2009).\n\nWith respect to this Chinese-created debris field, it is important to note that the\n\ntwo aforementioned U.S. documents, the U.S. DoD Space Policy and the National Space\n\npolicy of August 2006; both are directly in line with the United Nations Treaties and\n\nPrinciples on Outer Space, 2002. However, as both the U.S. and China are signatories of\n\nsaid treaty, we are both obligated to the “cleanliness” of space under Articles VII and IX.\n\nArticle VII specifically emphasizes that states are “internationally liable for damage to\n\nanother State Party to the Treaty or to its natural or juridical persons by such object or its\n\ncomponent parts on the Earth, in air space or in outer space. . .”[43] Additionally, Article\n\nIX covers the responsible use of space in a way that avoids harmful contamination of\n\n32\n\n\n-----\n\nouter space; in short, both articles do not ally themselves with the Chinese direct-ascent\n\nepisode of 2007.\n\nAn alternative to a direct-ascent counter-satellite technology are China‟s co\norbital micro-satellite network and their directed energy endeavors. On micro-satellites\n\nthere is the BX-1, a 40 kg possible ASAT released on September 27, 2008.[44] Although\n\nnot conclusively a confirmed ASAT, the BX-1 did make a significantly close pass to the\n\nInternational Space Station at a distance of only 45 km. Thus, the technology exists to\n\nrelease an ultra-small, agile, and lightweight microsatellite to be used as an ASAT\n\nplatform.\n\nDirected Energy, Kinetic Kill Vehicles, and Space Armies\n\nSpace armies should set up emergency launch units… in order to guarantee that\non the day it receives launch orders it will immediately launch space-based fire\nplatforms into orbit.[ 45]\n\n-- Prof Yuan Selu, PLA NDU 2005\n\nSignificantly more sophisticated than either the direct-ascent or co-orbital\n\nmicrosatellites are the directed-energy ASAT. China currently has a policy of using\n\nspace peacefully and has argued against the militarization of the space environment.\n\nHowever, they have also demonstrated the capabilities that ground-based and airborne\n\nhigh-powered lasers can damage non-hardened thermal controls, optical sensors, and\n\nsolar power components on LEO satellites. For example, in September 2006, the\n\nPentagon acknowledged that China had fired a high-powered laser at a U.S.\n\nreconnaissance satellite flying over Chinese territory.[46]\n\nThe PRC recognizes the U.S. utter dependence on space assets and has bolstered\n\ntheir capabilities above and beyond the direct ascent demonstration of 2007. This will\n\n33\n\n\n-----\n\nnot only potentially enable China to counter our asymmetric space advantage, but also\n\nseeks to “guarantee the viability of Chinese nuclear forces in the face of emerging\n\nAmerican missile defenses.”[47] Research on beam weapon proposals has been detailed by\n\nmore than 20 authors since 2005. Labeled as “new concept weapons” (or xin gainian\n\nwuqi), directed energy weapons cover the gambit of iterations such as high power lasers,\n\nmicrowaves, and particle beam weapons.[ 48]\n\nSignificantly more subtle and clearly reversible technologies are in the completely\n\nnon-lethal realm such as jammers used to degrade or disrupt functionality without the\n\nresultant debris caused by lethal ASAT weapons. Electronic jamming capabilities of the\n\nPLA are divided into both hardware interference and command interference. Hardware\n\njamming includes disrupting the electronic surveillance functionality of the U.S. systems.\n\nFor example, UHF-band satellite communications jammers acquired in the late 90‟s from\n\nthe Ukraine give the PLA the indigenous capability to jam common U.S. Army satellite\n\ncommunication bands and GPS receivers. Command jamming, on the other hand, refers\n\nto China‟s jamming of the remote control and remote sensing systems of U.S. military\n\nsystems. Research and development in intercepting, decoding, and jamming of the\n\nground command is focused on making the satellite deviate from orbit, tumble, exploit, or\n\nsimply turn off. Command interference is a cost-effective and potentially non-lethal\n\nweapon well within the realm of cyberspace.[49]\n\nTargeting satellite terrestrial support infrastructures as well as employing non\ncontemporary alternatives such as microwaves, particle beams, and electromagnetic pulse\n\nweapons, and these future technologies are all just on the PLA‟s horizon.[50] While the\n\nextents of China‟s ASAT capabilities are uncertain, what is clear is that the PLA is intent\n\n34\n\n\n-----\n\nof obtaining a form of Space Superiority. In our extremely heavy reliance on space\nbased support systems, especially endemic in future and current technologies such as the\n\nFuture Combat System Brigade Combat Team (FCS (BCT)), Blue Force Tracker, Global\n\nCommand and Control System, Naval Tactical Data Systems, Unmanned Aerial Systems,\n\nand INMARSAT, are all vulnerable targets.\n\nConcerning PLA space operations, the USCC 2008 determined that the PLA “has\n\nsufficient capability to meet many of [their] space goals.”[51] Through new, space-based\n\nassets, they have expanded significantly their electronic and signals intelligence\n\ncapabilities. This contributes greatly to their military‟s Command, Control,\n\nCommunications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR)\n\nprojection capability out to, and including, the southern Pacific Ocean.\n\nFinally, the PLA has been urged to develop space weapons that demonstrate\n\nassassin‟s mace capabilities. As such, they have pushed for covert implementation of\n\nspace-based fire networks. This would employ standby emergency astronautic launches\n\nthat would not directly counter international space law. These mobile launch vehicle\n\nweapons would employ both space-based directed and kinetic energy capabilities to\n\ncounter U.S. LEO network systems.[52] Colonel Yuan Zelu, PLA, proposes a total war\n\noption that would guarantee that once their space armies receive launch orders, they will\n\nimmediately fire their weapon systems into orbit.\n\n35\n\n\n-----\n\nUnited States on United States\n\nDomestic Policy on Cyberspace\n\nUnder the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative\n\nCurrent criminal provisions are essentially reactive by nature as they do not\n\nspecifically authorize jurisdictional hurdles hampering law enforcement and or military\n\naction needed to address cyber-warriors operating abroad. However, both the Federal\n\nInformation Security Management Act of 2002 (hereafter FIMSA, USC Title 44 §3541,\n\naddresses in a later subchapter) along with the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity\n\nInitiative (CNCI) take preventative approaches to halting cyber-warriors.\n\nIn response to extensive cyber-intrusions into government and DoD computer\n\nnetworks by both known and unknown actors (not necessarily Chinese in origin), the\n\nBush Administration in 2008 established the CNCI as a joint presidential directive. The\n\nCNCI establishes the policy, strategy, and guidelines to secure the federal system[53] while\n\ncollectively seeking to identify both current and emerging cyber-threats, establish\n\nprotection measures for current and future cyber-vulnerabilities, and delineate responses\n\nto address entities wishing to steal or manipulate protected data on secure federal\n\nsystems. As of this thesis‟s composition, the U.S. is still within President Obama‟s 60\nday interagency cyber-security review (as of 09 February, 2009). Of note, two major\n\nquestions have emerged since the Bush Administrations departure that directly relates to\n\nthis thesis‟ topic: the adequacy of existing legal authorities for responding to cyber\nthreats (which will be addressed in follow-on subchapters), and the appropriate roles that\n\nboth the President and Congress will play in addressing cyber-security.[54]\n\n36\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addressing the legality of Presidential responses to cyber-threats (up to and\n\nincluding invoking war powers) both the Center for Strategic and International Studies\n\n(CSIS) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) recommended Executive action\n\nto protect U.S. Cyberspace. When addressing the cyber-warriors, our Executive Branch\n\nmust find support in either the powers granted him as Commander-in-Chief (CINC)\n\nunder either Article II of the U.S. Constitution, or those congressionally delegated to him\n\nvia Article I powers.[55] Unfortunately, the CNCI acknowledges that the scope of response\n\nand especially the act of invoking war powers in with regards to cyber-warfare defies\n\ntraditional military strategies and may even fall outside the traditional definitions of\n\nwar.[56] The CNCI give an example that with regards to private sector domestic cyber\nsecurity (e.g. Yahoo! servers) war powers would not likely apply; however, the CINC\n\nmight well-assert his constitutional oath-based obligation to defend the nation from\n\nimminent threats such as foreign cyber-intrusions or cyber-attacks.\n\nIn summary, as of this thesis‟ writing, Congress has yet to authorize the cyber\nsecurity reforms proposed by the CNCI. Additionally, the FISMA does not authorize all\n\ncyber-security protections, so the CINC is left with one of several options. He can call\n\nupon the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force if a tie with the 9/11 attackers\n\ncould be made (doubtful in a case against Chinese cyber-warriors). However, it is more\n\nlikely that he will follow the advice of Mary Ann Davison, CSO for Oracle, who testified\n\nbefore congress that “given the diversity of potentially hostile entities building cadres of\n\ncyberwarrior . . . congress should consider developing a 21st century application of the\n\nMonroe Doctrine.”[57]\n\n37\n\n\n-----\n\nUnder U.S. Code\n\nRegardless of the significant cyber-based threats to the U.S. Government and our\n\ndomestic national interests, the Use of Army and Air Force as Posse Comitatus (PCA, 18\n\nUSC §1385) significantly restricts DoD‟s ability to truly “dominate” Cyberspace.\n\nEstablished as a U.S. Federal Law on June 16, 1878 after the conclusion of the\n\nReconstruction, it expresses that anyone who, “except in cases and under circumstances\n\nexpressly authorized by the Constitution of Act of Congress, willfully uses any part of the\n\nArmy or the Air Force as a posse comitatus or otherwise to execute the laws shall be\n\nfined under this title or imprisoned not more than two years, or both.”[58] Basically, it\n\nmakes it illegal for the U.S. military to execute the laws of the U.S., specifically in the\n\nperformance of domestic civilian law enforcement functions.\n\nHowever, this is not to imply in any way that the U.S. Government is powerless to\n\nprotect our national interests, especially when the DoD is under attack. 18 USC § 1386 is\n\nsignificantly different from the aforementioned PCA in that it specifically addresses those\n\nindividuals who attempt to steal, purloin, embezzle, or obtain by false pretense any lock\n\nor key to any lock knowing that such lock or key has been adopted by any part of the\n\nDepartment of Defense. Barring future advents of USC specific to Cyberspace, this\n\n“key” and its interpretation thereof, can be extended into the virtual realm as those\n\nmethods and procedures used to ensure DoD authentication, non-repudiation, and\n\nencryption of our systems.\n\n10 USC §2224, unlike the PCA, delineates to the Secretary of Defense specific\n\nactions such as the establishment of the Defense Information Assurance Program. As\n\nsuch, he is responsible to the National Command Authority for the “continuous\n\n38\n\n\n-----\n\navailability, integrity, authentication, confidentiality, non-repudiation, and rapid\n\nrestitution of information and information systems that are essential elements of the\n\nDefense Information Structure.”[59] However, these responsibilities are limited by 44 USC\n\n§3541 which praises “commercially developed information security products” but\n\nrecognizes that “the selection of specific technical hardware and software information\n\nsecurity solutions should be left to individual agencies. . . .”[60] While this represents the\n\ncrux of the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002, it also begs the\n\nquestion, how is the OSD to ensure the integrity of information systems critical to the\n\nDoD when agencies can self-determine their software and hardware configurations\n\nindependently? Additionally, 44 USC §3541 runs contrary to recent testimony given by\n\nthe director of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, who gave as his top\n\nrecommendation was a call for regulations and that the private sector “will never deliver\n\nadequate security and the government must establish regulatory thresholds for critical\n\ninfrastructures.”[61]\n\nInternational Policy on Cyberspace--United Nations Charter\n\nAlthough there is a considerable body of international law that governs the use of\nforce in Cyberspace, technology does not allow a state to completely prevent\ncomputer espionage or computer network attack, nor does it assure that a state can\nreliably determine the identity of an intruder or attacker in any timely manner.[62]\n\nJus ad bellum, the law of conflict management or the Latin literal translation of\n\n“Justice to War,” is a set of rules that govern the resorting to armed conflict and\n\ndetermine whether said conflict is lawful or unlawful in its inception.[63] Contemporary\n\nrecognition of a state‟s right to resort to war is captured in Article 2(4) of the Charter of\n\nthe United Nations. Written in 1945, well before the existence of a Cyberspace, this\n\n39\n\n\n-----\n\narticle still has basis in today‟s cyber-conflicts as it redefines for us the principles of jus\n\nas bellum. It states that:\n\nAll Members [of the United Nations] shall refrain in their international relations\nfrom the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political\nindependence of any state, or in a manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the\nUnited Nations.[64]\n\nUnfortunately, the charter neither defines what the threat of force or, more\n\nimportantly, what constitutes the use of force. Additionally, how does Cyberspace fit\n\ninto this equation? Assuming that China, or any state for that matter, would never lay\n\nclaim that neither Computer Network Defense (CND) nor Electronic Protection measures\n\n(EP) are an act of aggression; we are left with CNE/ES and CNA/ECM.\n\nWith respect to both CNE and ES, we have international precedent from the\n\n1950‟s through 70‟s where 22 military intelligence aircrafts were attacked by the former\nSoviet Union. In 1960, the Soviet government asserted before a United Nations panel\n\nthat a specific U-2 flight by the U.S. over Soviet territory constituted an act of aggression.\n\nThe United Nations disagreed and concluded that while the U-2 flights violated Soviet\n\nairspace, the act by itself did not constitute a use of force as dictated by Article 2(4).\n\nInteresting point of fact, however, was that due to the political implications of a military\n\naircraft flying over sovereign USSR, military pilots were required to resign their\n\ncommissions before flying the CIA-owned platform[65]. This case established two\n\npresidencies with regards to CNE and ES:\n\n1. All nations are afforded reasonable self-defense response proportionate, if not in\n\nkind, to the danger posed by the presence of the trespassing collection assets.\n\n2. If the unlawful, physical penetration of a state‟s airspace by intelligence aircrafts\n\nof another state‟s is not construed under the U.N. Charter as a use of force, then a\n\n40\n\n\n-----\n\nCNE and/or ES taken by one country against another also cannot be construed as\n\na use of force either.\n\nTherefore, so long as the action taken by the victim state is meet principles of\n\nproportionality with respect to the danger posed by the presence of the cyber-spy (using\n\nES/CNE methods), the victim state is acting well within the intent of U.S. Article 2(4).\n\nUnfortunately, that begs the question, what is a proportionate response?\n\n1Kristen Gunness, “An Assessment and Analysis of PLA Publication”.

Training: From a strictly academic position, compare and contrast the\n\neducation and training a PLA cyber-warrior receives as compared to a\n\nU.S. Soldier. This will identify training gaps in the U.S. military\n\neducation system and possible advantages that we have over PLA forces.\n\n2. Weapon systems: Beyond the rudimentary listing of advance computing\n\ncapabilities or routine hacker scripts, viruses, and DDoS-techniques used\n\nin executing typical CNO, what specific cyber-systems do each country\n\nposses that can deny, deceive, degrade, or disrupt operations in the cyber\nrealm with regards to both the means and the mediums through which\n\ninformation is relayed. As this in an unclassified thesis, the U.S. counters\n\nwill merely list the system name with no description unless common\n\nknowledge.\n\n3. Planning: With regards to integration into the planning cycle, how does\n\nChina's Integrated Network Electronic Warfare (INEW) either differ or\n\nexpound upon the U.S. Network Centric Warfare.\n\n4. Full Spectrum Operations: From the perspective of the U.S. military, how\n\ndoes the literature review from Chapter 2 map out along the U.S. Army‟s\n\nview of Full Spectrum Operations (FSO)? What precursors to Chinese\n\n45\n\n\n-----\n\nPLA activities should we expect through both rhetoric and established\n\nprecedent?\n\nAnalysis of these four should answer my thesis of \"to what extent the Chinese\n\ncyber-warriors represent a viable threat to both the security and prosperity of our nation\n\nas a whole,\" as well as \"ascertain[ing] the U.S. Government‟s ability to defend and\n\nenforce our national interests, both in regards to our own domestic infrastructures as well\n\nas our partners abroad from Chinese-directed cyber-attacks\"\n\n46\n\n\n-----\n\nCHAPTER 4\n\nANALYSIS\n\nOnce again, the purpose of this paper is to determine to what extent the Chinese\n\ncyber-warriors represent a viable threat to both the security and prosperity of our nation\n\nas a whole. Chapter 4 now takes the lessons from Chapter 2‟s Literature Review and\n\nseeks to introduce an analytical perspective that will evaluate holistically:\n\n1. How the PLA train their cyber warriors from an educational perspective\n\n2. What cyber-weapons the PRC equips their on the battlefield to conduct\n\nINEW\n\n3. How the Chinese plan to incorporate their cyber-warriors in major combat\n\noperations\n\n4. How do Chinese view the domain of Cyberspace across the entire\n\nspectrum of conflict\n\nTraining: U.S. vs. PLA Cyber-warrior\n\nThe PLA has spent the past several years pursuing a comprehensive build-up from\n\na mass army designed for a protracted war of attrition into one capable of fighting and\n\nwinning short duration, high-tech wars under “conditions of informatization (sic).”[ 1] As\n\nnoted in the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review, China has the “greatest potential to\n\ncompete militarily with the U.S. and field disruptive military technologies that could over\n\ntime offset traditional U.S. military advantages.” As mentioned earlier, the PLA‟s\n\ncurrent focus is on preparing for contingencies in the Taiwan Strait, thus supporting their\n\ndrive for modernization or in their own words informationalization. The scope of this\n\n47\n\n\n-----\n\nmodernization has increased in recent years, signaled by the high rate of investment in\n\ndomestic defense supported by scientific and technological innovations.\n\nOn the training of these men and women, the responsibilities for offensive and\n\ndefensive cyber-warfare and their associated education and training are all shared by the\n\nPLA, the Ministry of State Security, the Ministry of Communications and the Propaganda\n\nDepartment. In the PLA it appears that cyber-warfare is the primary responsibility of\n\nGeneral Staff Department Deputy Director General Chen Xiaogong, who oversees the\n\nThird Department of the General Staff Department. As such, it is General Xiaogong‟s\n\nresponsibility for executing military cyber-warfare operations that incorporate electronic\n\nwarfare, and electronic and signals intelligence (ELINT) within not only the PLA, but\n\nalso the PLAN and PLAAF. The entire Third Department is led General Qui Ruilin, with\n\nGeneral Wu Guohua as his technical director. Deputy Directors include General Pan\n\nHuizhong, who is also deputy director of the PLA's Central Communication University,\n\nGeneral Liu Xiaobei, an encryption specialist, Professor Yang Huida and Professor Liu\n\nMeng. Finally, the Fifth Bureau is headed by Professor Yang Jingzong, who is a\n\nspecialist in communication security as well as information operations.\n\nThe training and development of the PLA cyber-warriors is predominantly\n\nconducted at the Information Security University in which students are taught in the\n\npractice of Information Security (IS) defense and attack techniques, as well as theory in\n\nthe military arena. Graduation enables the PLA cyber-warriors to work in national\n\ndefense and all military departments and levels.[2] Of the academic curriculum that is to\n\nfollow,[3] all is contained within the teaching plan for Military Information Security\n\nStudies (MISS) for the PLA. For comparison, the Naval Postgraduate School was\n\n48\n\n\n-----\n\nselected, although any post-graduate service school would have produced equivalent\n\nresults.\n\n# U.S. Naval Postgraduate School

U.S. Naval PG School vs. PLA Military Information Security Studies\n_Source: Relevant details pertaining to the PLA MISS extracted via Timothy Thomas‟_\nresearch in “Decoding the Virtual Dragon: Critical Evolutions in the Science and\nPhilosophy of China‟s Information Operations and Military Strategy” (Foreign Military\nService Office 2007) pg 150; applicable details pertaining to NPS MS in CS via\nhttp://www.nps.edu/Admissions/Catalog/index.html in the Naval Postgraduate School\nAcademic Catalog 2009 (accessed 18 March 2009).\n\nIt becomes readily apparent that while the PLA do receive advanced specialized\n\n\ntraining in the areas of virus development and hacking techniques, their curriculum is\n\nwoefully insufficient when compared to that taught at the U.S. Naval Postgraduate\n\n\nSchool (NPS) in nearly every category. Granted, the curriculum was laid out in 2002,\n\nwhich explains the PLA‟s lack of wireless training, however at the time it met the PLA\n\n\nshort-term goal of establishing a common, full-time university supporting information\n\nsecurity at the undergraduate and professional level.[4] One final note emphasizing the\n\n\nfocus of study, PLA‟s MISS program has 4 required courses on viruses and hacking\n\nmethods. This compared to the NPS‟s zero courses begs the question of relevance. It\n\n\nshould not be assumed that the PLA is developing better CNA warriors simply because\n\nthey received a series of virus scripting courses. On the contrary, with little to no\n\n\n51\n\n\n-----\n\nexperience in code writing beyond the undergraduate exposure to coding principles, one\n\nmust question their hacking ability beyond that of a junior script-kiddie.\n\nThis in no way implies that the PLA would be ineffective in their application of\n\nCNO on the battlefield. However, it does bring forth the question as to both the\n\nadaptability and flexibility of the PLA cyberwarrior to the dynamic nature of real-life\n\ncombat operations against a very capable adversary such as the United States.\n\nWeapons: U.S. vs. PLA Cyber-warrior\n\nAs discussed in Chapter 1, the PLA is actively pursuing an assassin‟s mace\n\nweapon that when used will produce devastating results on the U.S. military‟s ability to\n\ncontinue armed conflict. The application of this weapon system must be decisive in its\n\nuse of surprise and represents a revolution in military affairs. Listed below are the most\n\npopular PLA weapon systems to date separated by the service most-likely to utilize\n\nsystem.\n\n52\n\n\n-----\n\n|U.S. Army vs PLA|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|U.S. Army|People‟s Liberation Army - Ground5|\n|NIPR: Army Knowledge Online (AKO) SIPR: AKO(S)|All-Army Public Data Exchange Network: In order provide data exchange services at the national and theatre levels.

Their specific objective is to identify exploitable weaknesses that can be used by conventional forces (PLA) against a digitized army (U.S.). Each soldier can transfer real-time image and video battlefield information to C2; each vehicle possesses independent navigation/positioning, battlefield image capturing, target acquisition, audio/image/data transmission, and laser warning and defense.|\n|Advanced Threat IR Countermeasures (ATIRCM) Counter Missile Warning System (CMWS) Chinese system seeks to counter: Bolt-117, JDAM|Bodyguard Laser-Guided Weapon Countermeasures System: Loaded in two cross-country trucks and two trailers, the Bodyguard laser countermeasures system comprises five subsystems, including Laser Warning Receivers (LWR), Active Laser Jamming (ALJ), Passive Laser Jamming (PLJ), Central Display Control (CDC) and Power Supply (PS). One system is capable of protecting an area of 6,000~16,000 square meters. The Bodyguard system will be deployed near the target to be protected. When enemy aircraft turns on its laser illuminating to aim the targets, the laser warning receivers deployed around the target will pick up the laser beam and inform the CDC unit. Within seconds the PLJ will launch grenades to form a smoke obstacle over the protected target to block the enemy's laser illuminating. At the same time the ALJ unit will launch similar laser beam to the fake targets some distance away from the protected targets. The fake targets reflects the laser signal back to the enemy‟s laser guided weapon to misguide it so that it will hit the fake target rather than the real one.|\n|GCCS, JTIDS, NTDS|Regional Integrated Electronic System (\"Qu Dian\") - Project 995: The PLA began to construct a theatre-level command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, target- acquisition, reconnaissance (C4ISTAR) network at its southeast coast region in the 1990s. This network, known as Regional Integrated Electronic System (Qu Dian), is an automated battle management system that can support joint operations with combined ground, naval, and air forces.|\n\n\n53\n\n\n-----\n\n|Col1|The centre of the “Qu Dian” system is a dedicated military communications satellite codenamed FengHuo-1 (FH-1) first launched in January 2000. The Pentagon described that system as \"a secure, jam-resistant, high capacity data link communications system for use in a tactical combat.\" It was China‟s first space-based communication platform to provide military units with both C-band and UHF communications. The “Qu Dian” system allows theatre commanders to communicate with and share data with all forces under joint command. The current “Qu Dian” system in southeast China mainly focuses on a possible conflict with Taiwan. The system covers military units within Nanjing and Guangzhou (Fig. 1) military regions. The system includes a theatre joint operation C4I centre (JOC), which is capable of rapidly passing operational orders down the chain of command and moving information to national and theatre level decision makers. The theatre JOC has direct communication links with C4I centers of Nanjing Military Region (MR), Nanjing Military Region Air Force (MRAF), Guangzhou MR, Guangzhou MRAF, Navy Headquarters, East Sea Fleet, maritime task forces and a submarine intelligence centre. The “Qu Dian” system enables theatre commanders to create an integrated battlefield picture, centralizing data from ground, air, naval and space-based platforms for wide dissemination to subordinate units. The system controls a large number of platforms including imagery and radar reconnaissance satellites, airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft, electronic intelligence (ELINT) aircraft, electronic warfare aircraft, ELINT ships, land- based observation stations, land-based electronic warfare & countermeasure (EW/ELINT) units, etc.|\n|---|---|\n|ELINT (1-18Ghz)|DZ9001 Mobile Electronic Intelligence System: The DZ9001 is a mobile electronic intelligence (ELINT) system designed to detect, intercept, analyze, identify and record the enemy radar radiation. By collecting and analyzing the signals of enemy radar, their technical parameters and operation modes can be acquired and recorded for both defensive and offensive electronic countermeasures operations such as suppression of air defense (SEAD). The DZ9001 system is composed of 1~8 GHz low-band system, 8~18GHz high-band system and power supply. The high- and low- band systems can operate separately or in together. The system was developed by Jiangnan Electronic & Communications Research Institute (JECOR, also known as 36 Institute) of Jiangxing, Zhejiang Province. The development began in 1984 and the system entered the PLA service in the late 1980s|\n|Prophet System|JN1105A Communications Jammer: The JN1105A is a mobile communication countermeasures system designed to locate and jam|\n\n\n54\n\n\n-----\n\n|Col1|enemy tactical radio communication signals. The system was developed by 36 Institute (now Jiangnan Electronic & Communications Research Institute, JECOR) of Jiangxing, Zhejiang Province in 1982. The JN1105A took part in the 1980s China- Vietnam border conflict and played important roles in the electronic warfare to suppress Vietnamese Army command & control and communications networks. The system can cover the communication frequencies of HF (1.6~30MHz), VHF (30~100MHz), and UHF (100~500MHz). The whole system is carried on a vehicle, but can also be dissembled and carried by several soldiers on specially-designed racks to reach remote areas in mountain and highland|\n|---|---|\n|No traditional counter or vulnerable primary system in U.S. arsenal|JN1601 Communications Jammer: The JN1601 is an integrated communication countermeasures system designed to search, intercept, monitor, analyze, and jam enemy high-frequency (HF) communication signals.

With Dai‟s theories on Battlefield Information\n\nEnvironment (BIE) presented in 1999 as well as Colonels Qiao Liang and Wang\n\nZiangsui‟s Unrestricted Warfare, how does the PLA‟s plan to implement cyberspace in\n\norder to compensate for their military inferiority compete with the U.S. execution of Network\n\nCentric Warfare?\n\nDai presented several interesting arguments in support of Integrated Network\nElectronic Warfare (INEW). First, he dissected the two emphasizing that EW‟s objectives\n\nare the disruption of an opponent‟s acquisition and forwarding of information; while\n\ncomputer network warfare‟s objectives are to disrupt the opponent‟s processing and use of\n\ninformation.[6] However, in bringing the two back together, several of Dai‟s INEW\n\ncharacteristics, while sound in their theoretical application in a combat environment, one\n\nfinds an equal number of weak arguments as indicated in the following chart:\n\n57\n\n\n-----\n\nPLA‟s Major General Dai Qingmin‟s characteristics of INEW[7]\n\n**Dai on Battlespace: Anywhere networks** **Dai on Effectiveness: INEW takes as its main**\nand electromagnetic waves reach can targets of attack the normal operation of the\npossibly be the site of an information information system in the enemy‟s political, military,\noperations attack; thus, INEW will take economic, and social systems.

Dai Qingmin on Integrated Network-Electronic Warfare (INEW)\n\nThe military academic theories of Dai, however, seem to have made the way of\n\nother armchair generals focused on fighting the last war, and despite his assertions in\n\nsupport of INEW, his theories are not well demonstrated in current PLA training.\n\nThroughout the literature review in support of Chapter 2, the repeated sentiment was that\n\nwhile theory is respected, the PLA trains their forces exactly as they intend to fight. As\n\nsuch, PLA military activities in February 2009 would be a good indicator for how one\n\nshould expect the Chinese to employ their cyber-warriors in a more-current conflict.

The integrated plan must reflect in full the basic trend of development and the rules of action. However, also in 2002 Dai stressed the “plebification” trend, emphasizing that the populace can now participate in network warfare far from the front lines.8 FLAWED: Dai is quite unrealistic and somewhat irresponsible in suggesting the public become involved in national affair, and at minimum involved in direct support of military combatants. Even so, his two statements are contradictory without an established means to control Chinese nationalists as he does not provide insight on the handling of rogue citizens.|Dai on Combat Objectives: Information systems with their computer networks have become the lifeblood of nations‟ economies and their armed forces. If these networks become paralyzed, a nation‟s entire security faces a serious threat. Therefore, as soon as this lifeblood is attacked, the combat power of the armed force will be degraded, or even completely lost. FLAWED: INEW‟s success directly depends on an adversary‟s complete reliance of their C4ISR in order to conduct any effect military operation. For the U.S. we must be completely dependent on the Global Information Grid and NCW in order for INEW to have the impact he expects. Dai assumes too much as the U.S. has historically dominated the battlespace without the assistance of NCW with the only exception being the most-recent conflict.|\n\n\n-----\n\nexample, in the Beijing MR (Figure 1), the Special Merit 5th Company has developed a\n\nsystem of training infantry units under complex electromagnetic settings. The 5th\n\nCompany confronted 9 other companies in rotation; each equipped with significantly\n\nstronger, high-tech EA and ISR capabilities. Despite their technological shortcomings,\n\nthey were ultimately able to work out winning strategies by exploiting their existing\n\ntransceivers for use in different settings. What is important to note is not the specific\n\ntechnique they used, but rather the fact that the communication units of the PLA ground\n\nforces are focusing on proactively testing and improving their combat methods in a\n\nvariety of realistic confrontations.[9] Not attempting to “capture . . . information\n\nsupremacy in [both] electromagnetic and network space”[10] as Major General Qingmin\n\nwould have wanted. In fact, if one assumes that the training methodology used by the\n\nPLA is a direct indication of their tactics, techniques, and procedures that will be used in\n\ncombat, then the Chinese will likely mimic the U.S. network-centric warfare. The\n\nliterature indicates that the PLA seek to develop a competitive warfighting advantage\n\nthrough the development of well-networked, dispersed forces capable of ensuring\n\ncontinued operations.\n\nFull Spectrum Operations: U.S. vs. PLA Cyber-Warrior\n\nThe PLA seek to incorporate both lethal and non-lethal skills if and when they\n\nbecome involved in conflict. Assuming that their training conducted across military\n\nregions (Figure 1) over the past 10 years represents the actions that we should expect they\n\nwould take when exposed to similar operational environment and involved in actual\n\ncombat what actions would separate their operational themes, and what would their FSOs\n\nlook like? For Cyberspace, the PLA have demonstrated a very complex and vibrant\n\n59\n\n\n-----\n\nspectrum of operations through which they maintain control. As such, figures 3 and 4\n\nboth seek to address the PLA‟s operational themes in a full spectrum operations\n\nenvironment.\n\nIn Peacetime Military Engagements the PLA will likely have as its only offensive\n\nelement more non-discriminatory CNE operations as discussed in 2.2a. Space operations\n\nand EW, however, will continue to support ASAT testing (from 2.2c) but only on\n\nChinese space assets and EW jamming within the 7 MRs (Figure 1) and from naval\n\nassets. From a defensive standpoint, the PLA will establish and demonstrate the use of\n\nEWP in their military exercises while their CND will continue identifying and securing\n\ncritical PLA assets across the Chinese global information grid (GIG). Finally, for\n\nstability operations, the PLA will continue to pursue non-U.S. global positioning-type\n\nsatellite systems and deter reliance on the U.S.-led system for fear of selected availability.\n\nOperating in the spectrum of Limited Intervention, PLA will enhance their CNE\n\ncapabilities offensively to include limited CNA as required to test U.S. system defenses\n\nfor possible future exploitation. In space operations, the PLA will increase employment\n\nof directed energy on U.S. IMINT collection platforms.\n\n60\n\n\n-----\n\n|Offensive: Complete CNA of DoD NIPR (poss SIPR) and sufficient CNA of financial infrastructure to cripple U.S. government decision making (eg GhostNet).|Col2|Major Combat Operations|\n|---|---|---|\n|Stability: PRC/PLA disconnect from GIG|Defensive: PLA C2 via PDEXN||\n\n|Offensive: PLA CNE of critical U.S. DoD infrastructure, PLA CNE and Hacktivist CNA of U.S. financial network|Stability: PLA & militia enforcement of censorship, secure local and PRC/CMC governmental sys.|\n|---|---|\n|Defensive: Gain and retain control of U.S. severs||\n\n|Offensive: CNE/CNA|Stability: Civil restrictions or censorship of Chinese internet|\n|---|---|\n|Defensive: Increased PLA Infocon level, demonstrate PLA ability to operate in a non- computer environment via TTP/PPR, deter U.S. CNE /CNA though threat of “assassin's mace.”||\n\n|Military ment|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|Offensive: CNE only|Defensive: CND, identify and protect critical PLA network infrastructures|\n|Stability: Meet network needs of the populace, gain national support for PLA and CMC through propaganda, shape environment through public demonstrations of CNO abilities (XCON „06 & „08)||\n\n\n**Stable** **Unstable** **General**\n\n**Insurgency**\n\n**Peace** **Peace** **War**\n\n\nIrregular Offensive: PLA CNE of\n\nWarfare critical U.S. DoDinfrastructure, PLA CNE\n\nand Hacktivist CNA of\n\n\nPeacetime Military\n\nEngagement\n\nOffensive:\n\n\n**UNCLASSIFIED - FOUO**\n\nFigure 6.

Each country\n\nrepresented their own interpretation with respect to that which the PLA cyber-warriors\n\nare capable of accomplishing. From the Chinese perspective, chapter 2 first introduced\n\nthe difficulties associated with embracing literature generated through the PLA\n\npublishing and media systems as they relate to propaganda. However, certain gems, such\n\nas Unrestricted Warfare, give us unique insight into the PRC and their views on how best\n\nto implement cyber-warriors and Chinese nationals. As such, we can conclude that in no\n\nuncertain terms, the Chinese fully intend to use completely unconventional methods of\n\nwarfare that extend beyond exploiting traditional CNO-EW and space assets. Chapter 2\n\ncontinues by introducing the PLA practices of counter-reconnaissance as well as theories\n\nwhich include integrating a civil-military aspect in CNO (the hacktivists). On EW,\n\nresearch and development beyond traditional communications and satellite jamming\n\nparameters is certainly on the PLA‟s forefront. Finally, Chinese literature responded to\n\nthe accusations of the GhostNet as anticipated, by pointing back at western nations for\n\n58\n\n\n-----\n\nmanufacturing the situation. However, it is the depth of GhostNet‟s penetration into our\n\ncivil and economic infrastructures that is most worrisome.\n\nThe U.S.‟s perspective of China follows in Chapter 2 with a strong reminder of\n\nthe Chinese historical trends of preemptive use of force. Their history, along with\n\nrhetoric implying the PLA considering CNO as a first-strike option leaves one to assert\n\nthat the Chinese are pursuing their asymmetric advantage in CNO. On seizing\n\nelectromagnetic dominance, the U.S. clearly recognizes the Chinese efforts to emphasize\n\ntheir technological base in C4ISR. Finally, on the significant advances in counter space\n\nassets, the January 2007 ASAT is only one of several assassin‟s mace that the Chinese\n\nwould like to develop more of.\n\nUnfortunately, legal analysis both into domestic and international cyber-law leave\n\nthe U.S. military in a dilemma that has yet to be solved. The Comprehensive National\n\nCybersecurity Initiative (CNCI) is still under its 60-day review, and as of this thesis it has\n\nyet to identify a clear solution. Guiding principles gleaned from U.S. Code lack the\n\nnecessary clarification and are contradictory at best. Internationally, we depend upon\n\nUnited Nations Charters generated over 60 years ago which leaves the United States with\n\nthe vague option of a thus far undefined proportionality against a CNE.\n\nThe chapter on Analysis introduces 4 perspectives that were used to evaluate the\n\nextent to which Chinese cyber-warriors represent a viable threat to our nation. First,\n\nthrough the assistance of research from the Virtual Dragon, and a cross-comparison with\n\nthe U.S. Naval Postgraduate School, it became readily apparent that the PLA CNO\n\nacademic curriculum is woefully insufficient and severely lacks training especially in a\n\nvariety of necessary computing languages. Unfortunately, as the only PLA Military\n\n59\n\n\n-----\n\nInformation Security Studies curriculum was from 2002, at this time, there is no way to\n\nconfirm that the coursework has not expanded to either mimic U.S. training, or build to a\n\nlevel beyond our own.\n\nThe second perspective seeks to analyze both the equipment capabilities and our\n\nequivalent systems. This list is limited in its applicability as there is neither a listing to\n\nindicate the number of actual systems in the PLA inventory, nor the relative experience in\n\neach system. Throughout the literature review there are references to actual military\n\nexercises incorporating the PLA operating in a complex electro-magnetic environment.\n\nHowever, rarely will periodicals such as PLA Daily list the specific system by name.\n\nOne critical gem from all this: first the PLA has implemented an FCS-type program with\n\nthe sole objective of identifying exploitable weaknesses in U.S. systems. As such, we\n\ncan expect future combat to be extremely FCS-unfriendly.\n\nThe third analysis sought to extract the PLA planning and implementation\n\nprocedures for the Chinese cyber-warriors. To do this, Major General Dai Qingmin‟s\n\nworks were dissected starting from his Battlefield Information Environment in 1999 to an\n\ninterview several years later. Two critical holes in his theory are discussed implying that\n\nhis INEW theories will remain exactly that: a theory. Chinese military exercises from\n\n2000 till February 2009 only discuss informationalization along with the modernization\n\nof their force. Terms implying a counter-Network Centric Warfare model such as INEW\n\nare reserved for academia.\n\nFinally, the fourth analysis takes the highpoints from the thesis to generate a Full\n\nSpectrum Operations (FSO) graphic depicting likely PLA actions along the spectrum of\n\n60\n\n\n-----\n\nconflict. The main focus of which is the CNO capabilities but space and EW are viable\n\noptions as well.\n\nIn conclusion, in determining to what extent the PLA cyber-warriors represent a\n\nviable threat to the security and prosperity of our nation, the answer most certainly is\n\n“yes.” With that in mind one must surmise from this thesis that the threat is currently\n\nlimited in nature, but highly demonstrative in potential. For example--despite the fact\n\nthat the PLA cyber-warriors are at best script-kiddies when it comes to CNO, immature\n\nand non-expeditionary when it comes to EW, and neutralized of their asymmetric\n\nadvantage by our 2008 ASAT demonstration--they have demonstrated exponential\n\ngrowth and development since the publishing of Unrestricted Warfare in their MR\n\nexercises. Their theories and application of military theory mimics our own to a great\n\nextent, however a coordinated INEW assault is unlikely considering their lack of CNO\n\ntraining.\n\nRecommendations for future research are as follows:\n\n1. Further research on the PLA EW systems above the unclassified level.\n\nFor example, specifically how do the jamming capabilities of the PLA\n\nsystems compare with the U.S. military‟s?\n\n2. Current training pipeline and operational employment of the PLA CNO\n\nunits throughout the MR. For example, are the PLA cyber-warriors\n\nsimply system administrators or capable combat multipliers?\n\n3. What is the Chinese legal precedent on cyberspace defining their use of\n\nforce? Additionally, what is the specific legal protocol China uses in\n\n61\n\n\n-----\n\ndealing with hacktivists? Is there a clearly defined C2 structure through\n\nwhich the PRC is able to task Chinese nationals? What are the exploitable\n\nvulnerabilities in said structure?\n\n62\n\n\n-----\n\nGLOSSARY\n\nAssassin‟s Mace.
