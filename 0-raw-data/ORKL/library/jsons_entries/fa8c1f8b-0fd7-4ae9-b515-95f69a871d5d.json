The group focuses on companies that have\nintellectual property or sensitive information like those in the Defense and High-Tech\nindustries. The group is known to use custom malware called Daserf, but also employs\nmultiple commodity and custom tools, exploit vulnerabilities, and use social engineering\ntechniques.\n\nRegarding the command and control (C2) infrastructure, Tick previously used domains\nregistered through privacy protection services to keep their anonymity, but have moved to\ncompromised websites in recent attacks. With multiple tools and anonymous infrastructure,\n\n\n-----\n\nthey are running longstanding and persistent attack campaigns. We have observed that the\nadversary has repeatedly attacked a high-profile target in Japan using multiple malware\nfamilies for the last three years.\n\n## Tick Tools\n\n[Symantec was first to publicly report on Tick, followed by LAC in 2016. These reports](https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/adobe-zero-day-used-ladyboyle-attack)\ndiscussed the group’s malware, Daserf (a.k.a Muirim or Nioupale) and some additional\ndownloader programs. Though Daserf wasn't a popular attack tool at the time of publishing\nthe two reports, it dates back to at least 2011. Using [AutoFocus, we were able to identify the](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/secure-the-network/subscriptions/autofocus)\nlink among Daserf and two other threats, 9002 and Invader. These threats shared\ninfrastructure between July 2012 and April 2013.\n\n_Figure 1 Sharing C2 servers among threats_\n\nInvader (a.k.a Kickesgo) is a backdoor that injects its main code into a legitimate process,\nsuch as explorer.exe, and has following functions:\n\nLogs keystrokes and mouse movement\nCaptures screenshots\nOpens cmd.exe shell\nEnumerates processes\nExecutes programs\nRemoves itself\nEnumerates all opening TCP and UDP ports\n\n9002 is the infamous RAT frequently seen in targeted attacks reported by various security\n[vendors, including Palo Alto Networks. Interestingly, the C2 servers linking 9002 to Daserf](https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/tag/9002/)\n[were described in the report of an Adobe Flash Zero-day attack from FireEye in 2013. These](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2013/02/lady-boyle-comes-to-town-with-a-new-exploit.html)\ndomains were registered through the privacy protection services in 2008 and 2011.\n\nkrjregh.sacreeflame[.]com\nlywja.healthsvsolu[.]com\n\nThough we don't know the targets of these malware samples at the time of writing this article,\nwe suspect the same group is behind these threats for a number of reasons. The samples of\nDaserf that shared infrastructure were submitted to VirusTotal only from Japan multiple times\nin 2013. As noted in a later section, another Invader sample shared different C2 servers with\n\n\n-----\n\nDaserf. Symantec reported that Tick exploited additional Adobe Flash and Microsoft Office\n[vulnerabilities. SecureWorks said the adversary group is abusing a previously undisclosed](https://www.secureworks.jp/resources/rp-bronze-butler)\nvulnerability in Japanese Software Asset Management system on endpoints. Therefore, Tick\nor their digital quartermaster is capable of deploying new and unique exploits.\n\n## Minzen and Nameless Backdoor\n\nIn July 2016, we identified a compromised website in Japan that was hosting a Daserf\nvariant. The web server was also a C2 server for another threat, Minzen (a.k.a, XXMM, Wali,\nor ShadowWali). The threat often uses compromised web servers in Japan and the Republic\nof Korea.\n\nAs [Kaspersky and](https://securelist.com/blog/research/78010/old-malware-tricks-to-bypass-detection-in-the-age-of-big-data/) [Cybereason recently posted, Minzen is a modular malware that has both](https://www.cybereason.com/labs-shadowwali-new-variant-of-the-xxmm-family-of-backdoors/)\n32-bit and 64-bit components in its resource section or configuration data in its body. One of\nthe Minzen samples (SHA256:\n9374040a9e2f47f7037edaac19f21ff1ef6a999ff98c306504f89a37196074a2) found in the\nRepublic of Korea in December 2016 installs simple backdoor module as a final payload on a\ncompromised computer. It opens a TCP port and receives commands from a remote\nattacker. According to the debug path in the body, the author of the tool called it\n\"NamelessHdoor,\" and its internal version is identified as “V1.5.”\n\n_Figure 2 Debug path left in the backdoor module in Minzen_\n\nThe payload is based on \"Nameless Backdoor\" which has been publicly available for more\nthan ten years. The oldest code we could identify was hosted on a famous Chinese source\ncode sharing site since 2005. The author of the NamelessHdoor appears to have created\nadditional versions of the Nameless Backdoor by removing unnecessary functions, and\n[added open-source DLL injection code from ReflectiveDLLLoader.](https://github.com/stephenfewer/ReflectiveDLLInjection)\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3 Nameless Backdoor posted on Chinese Source File Sharing Site_\n\nThere is minimal public information regarding the Nameless Backdoor, except for the\n[interesting report from Cyphort in 2015. The researcher of the company analyzed multiple](https://www.cyphort.com/multiple-malwares-used-to-target-an-asian-financial-institution/)\nthreats, including Invader, Nioupale(Daserf) and Hdoor found in an attack against an Asian\nfinancial institution. We examined the sample described in the report as Hdoor and found it's\na previous version of the NamelessHdoor we discovered in the Minzen sample, but without\nsupport for DLL injection.\n\n_Figure 4 Strings in NamelessHdoor sample found in 2015_\n\n## Shared Infrastructure and Cipher Code with Custom Gh0st\n\nOther interesting samples in the report are dllhost.exe and Shell64.dll. We don't have the\nsame files but found possible variants close to their description in the article. These include\nthe following:\n\n\n-----\n\nExecutable files that connect to the same remote server, blog.softfix.co[.]kr:80,\ndownload a DLL file and execute the 'lowmain' export function.\nDLL files have 'lowmain' and 'main' exports.\n\nIt turned out that the DLL files we found are a custom variant of Gh0st RAT, and the EXE\nfiles download the RAT. Since the source code is publicly available, Gh0st RAT has been\nused by multiple actors for years.\n\nThe domain, softfix.co[.]kr was registered in 2014. One of subdomains, news.softfix.co[.]kr\nwas the C2 server of Daserf (SHA256:\n9c7a34390e92d4551c26a3feb5b181757b3309995acd1f92e0f63f888aa89423). Another\nsubdomain, bbs.softfix.co[.]kr was hosted on same IP address as bbs.gokickes[.]com, which\nwas reported as the C2 server of Invader by Cyphort. We also identified www.gokickes[.]com\nwas the C2 of another Invader variant (SHA256:\n57e1d3122e6dc88d9eb2989f081de88a0e6864e767281d509ff58834928895fb).\n\nIn addition to the infrastructure, the attacker also shared code. The Gh0st downloaders\nemploy simple substitution ciphers for hiding strings.\n\n_Figure 5 Decryption code in Gh0st Downloader_\n\nThe cipher converts one character to another based on a substitution table, which can be\nseen below. As an example, the character 'K' in plain text is changed to '5' in cipher text, 'h' is\nconverted to 'j' and so on. The string 'connect' was encoded to 'zF((0za' using this table.\n\nText characters\n\n\nplain\ntext\n\ncipher\ntext\n\n\nKhL9V1ds5Z\"QnfNC&Fb8xGr-()<>[]{}|+THce;0%7Oiz#W DE6qS?\naw./BJlk,yUPjgI ^@$*tumYA'p2RoX=v_:M43\n\n5j2Cnx^@$*(){}|+mX k3DK'LGchHNPgZ,z0T8_sRU7)<>\"[lBpdfI#%bu;yt-YeoW?\n4vAMQVa.6qJi:=wFO9&/1ESr\n\n\n-----\n\n_Table 1 Substitution Table used in Gh0st Downloader_\n\nThe following Python script can decipher the encoded string.\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n\n\nplaintext = \"KhL9V1ds5Z\\\"QnfNC&amp;Fb8xGr-()&lt;&gt;[]{}|+THce;0%7Oiz#W\nDE6qS?aw./BJlk,yUPjgI\\`^@$*tumYA'p2RoX=v_:M43\"\nciphertext = \"5j2Cnx\\`^@$*(]{}|+mX k3DK'LGchHNPgZ,z0T8_sRU7)&lt;&gt;\\\"\n\n[lBpdfI#%bu;yt-YeoW?4vAMQVa.6qJi:=wFO9&amp;/1ESr\"\n\nenc_string = \"zF((0za\"\n\ndec_strings = ''\nfor c in enc_string:\ndec_strings += plaintext[ciphertext.find(c)]\n\nprint dec_strings\n\n\nThe exact same table for simple substitution cipher is used in a variant of Daserf (SHA256:\n01d681c51ad0c7c3d4b320973c61c28a353624ac665fd390553b364d17911f46). We also\nfound a very similar table in other Tick tools. Since the strings are unique to these threats, we\nbelieve a developer linked to the group built these tools. Because of the shared domains and\ncode, we believe the incident reported by Cyphort have ties to Tick. The following tables\nwere identified for their associated malware samples:\n\nMinzen\n(SHA256:26727d139b593486237b975e7bdf93a8148c52d5fb48d5fe540a634a16a6ba82):\n\n\n1\n2\n\n\nplain text = \"5j2Cnx`^@$*(]{}|+mX k3DK'LGc!hHNPgZ,z0T8_sRU7)&lt;&gt;\"\n\n[lBpdfI#%bu;yt-YeoW?4vAMQVa.6qJi:=wFO9&amp;/1ESr\"\ncipher text = \"KhL9V1ds5Z\"QnfNC&amp;Fb8xGr-()&lt;&gt;[]{}|+THce;0%7O!iz#W\nDE6qS?aw./BJlk,yUPjgI`^@$*tumYA'p2RoX=v_:M43\"\n\n\nDatper (SHA256:\n7d70d659c421b50604ce3e0a1bf423ab7e54b9df361360933bac3bb852a31849):\n\n\n1\n2\n\n\nplain text = \"KhL9V1ds5Z\"QnfNC&amp;Fb8xGr-()&lt;&gt;[]{}|+THce;0%7O!iz#W\nDE6qS?aw./BJlk,yUPjgI`^@$*tumYA'p2RoX=v_:M43\"\ncipher text = \"5j2Cnx`^@$*(]{}|+mX k3DK'LGc!hHNPgZ,z0T8_sRU7)&lt;&gt;\"\n\n[lBpdfI#%bu;yt-YeoW?4vAMQVa.6qJi:=wFO9&amp;/1ESr\"\n\n\n## Spearphishing Email with Patched File Encryption Program\n\nWe also identified another malware family, HomamDownloader, sharing some servers with\nDaserf. An overview of the connections among these threats is discussed in below.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6 Links among threats and servers_\n\nHomamDownloader is a small downloader program with minimal interesting characteristics\nfrom a technical point of view. HomamDownloader was discovered to be delivered by Tick\nvia a spearphishing email. The adversary crafted credible email and attachment after\nunderstanding the targets and their behavior.\n\nThe email below was sent from a personal email account with a subject line of “New Year\nWishes on January 1st”. The message asked the recipient to rename the attachment\nextension from “._X_” to “.exe” and opening it with the password specified in the email to\nview the Happy New Year eCard in the correct and polite language.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7 Spearphishing Email with HomamDownloader_\n\nThe image above is translated to the following in English:\n\n_Dear XXXX,_\n\n_Heartfelt Greetings for the New Year._\n\n_Thank you very much for your support over the past year._\n\n_I will greatly appreciate your further guidance and encouragement._\n\n_Would you please change the file extension of the attachment from \"._X_\" to \".exe\" and open_\n_it?_\n\n_Password is \"nengajyo\"._\n\nFor those who are not familiar with Japanese companies, the email must look suspicious,\nespecially given that the executable file attachment has the incorrect file extension. However,\nthis may look legitimate in some cases. Many Japanese companies introduced a file\n\n\n-----\n\nencryption system for secure data exchange over email. The system encrypts documents\nwith a user-specified password and often creates a self-extracting (SFX) file for ease of\ndecrypting the file to recipients. When sending the SFX file with a password by email,\nsenders usually rename the file extension from .exe to something else to avoid blocking or\ndetecting the attachment by an email gateway or security product. The adversary may know\nJapanese enterprise users exchange these emails in such a way and crafts the\nspearphishing email in the same manner.\n\nIn addition to the social engineering email technique, the attacker also employs a trick to the\nattachment. The actor embedded malicious code to a resource section of the legitimate SFX\nfile created by a file encryption tool, and modified the entry point of the program for jumping\nto the malicious code soon after the SFX program starts. The malicious code drops\nHomamDownloader, then jumps back to the regular flow in the CODE section, which in turn\nasks the user the password and decrypts the file. Therefore, once a user executes the\nattachment and sees the password dialog on SFX, the downloader dropped by the malicious\ncode starts working even if the user chooses the Cancel on the password window. Should\nthe user become aware of the infection later, it may be difficult to find the cause due to the\nfact that the original embedded file contained within the SFX is benign.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8 Execution flow of Patched SFX file_\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTick was spotted last year, but they are actively and silently attacking various organizations\nin South Korea and Japan for a number of years. While some of the group’s tools, tactics,\nand procedures (TTPs) have been covered within this article, it is likely there is much that\nstill remains uncovered.\n\nPalo Alto Networks customers are protected by these threats in the following ways:\n\n1. All samples discussed are classified as malicious by the WildFire sandbox platform.\n2. All identified domains have been classified as malicious.\n3. AutoFocus users can track the malware described in this report using Tick campaign\n\ntag and various malware tags.\n4. Customers running Traps are protected from the discussed threats.\n\n## Indicator of compromise\n\nSHA256\n\nDaserf\n\n04080fbab754dbf0c7529f8bbe661afef9c2cba74e3797428538ed5c243d705a\nf8458a0711653071bf59a3153293771a6fb5d1de9af7ea814de58f473cba9d06\ne8edde4519763bb6669ba99e33b4803a7655805b8c3475b49af0a49913577e51\n21111136d523970e27833dd2db15d7c50803d8f6f4f377d4d9602ba9fbd355cd\n9c7a34390e92d4551c26a3feb5b181757b3309995acd1f92e0f63f888aa89423\n\nInvader\n\n0df20ccd074b722d5fe1358b329c7bdebcd7e3902a1ca4ca8d5a98cc5ce4c287\ne9574627349aeb7dd7f5b9f9c5ede7faa06511d7fdf98804526ca1b2e7ce127e\n57e1d3122e6dc88d9eb2989f081de88a0e6864e767281d509ff58834928895fb\n\n9002\n\n933d66b43b3ce9a572ee3127b255b4baf69d6fdd7cb24da609b52ee277baa76e\n2bec20540d200758a223a7e8f7b2f98cd4949e106c1907d3f194216208c5b2fe\n055fe8002de293401852310ae76cb730c570f2037c3c832a52a79b70e2cb7831\n\nMinzen\n\n797d9c00022eaa2f86ddc9374f60d7ad92128ca07204b3e2fe791c08da9ce2b1\n9374040a9e2f47f7037edaac19f21ff1ef6a999ff98c306504f89a37196074a2\n26727d139b593486237b975e7bdf93a8148c52d5fb48d5fe540a634a16a6ba82\n\n\n-----\n\nNamelessHdoor\n\ndfc8a6da93481e9dab767c8b42e2ffbcd08fb813123c91b723a6e6d70196636f\n\nGh0stRAt Downloader\n\nce47e7827da145823a6f2b755975d1d2f5eda045b4c542c9b9d05544f3a9b974\ne34f4a9c598ad3bb243cb39969fb9509427ff9c08e63e8811ad26b72af046f0c\n\nCustom Gh0st\n\n8e5a0a5f733f62712b840e7f5051a2bd68508ea207e582a190c8947a06e26f40\n\nDatper\n\n7d70d659c421b50604ce3e0a1bf423ab7e54b9df361360933bac3bb852a31849\n\nHomamDownloader\n\na624d2cd6dee3b6150df3ca61ee0f992e2d6b08b3107f5b00f8bf8bcfe07ebe7\n\n**C2**\nlywjrea.gmarketshop[.]net\nkrjregh.sacreeflame[.]com\npsfir.sacreeflame[.]com\nlywja.healthsvsolu[.]com\nphot.healthsvsolu[.]com\nblog.softfix.co[.]kr\nnews.softfix.co[.]kr\nwww.gokickes[.]com\nlog.gokickes[.]com\nsansei.jpn[.]com\n\n**Get updates from**\n**Palo Alto**\n**Networks!**\n\nSign up to receive the latest news, cyber threat intelligence and research from us\n\n[By submitting this form, you agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge our Privacy](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/legal-notices/terms-of-use)\nStatement.\n\n\n-----",
