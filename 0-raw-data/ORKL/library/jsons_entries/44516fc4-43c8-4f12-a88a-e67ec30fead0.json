ESET\nresearchers analyzed the ransomware and created a decryption tool for the victims.\n\n[CryCryptor surfaced just a few days after the Canadian government officially announced its](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/contact-tracing-app-1.5617121)\nintention to back the development of a nation-wide, voluntary tracing app called COVID Alert. The\nofficial app is due to be rolled out for testing in the province of Ontario as soon as next month.\n\nESET informed the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security about this threat as soon as it was\nidentified.\n\n_Figure 1. One of the malicious distribution websites; the other one has identical design and differs only in_\n\n_its domain, covid19tracer[.]ca._\n\nOnce the user falls victim to CryCryptor, the ransomware encrypts the files on the device – all the\nmost common types of files – but instead of locking the device, it leaves a “readme” file with the\nattacker’s email in every directory with encrypted files.\n\nFortunately, we were able to create a decryption tool for those who fall victim to this ransomware.\n\n\n-----\n\n_RELATED READING:_ _Mobile security threats amid COVID‑19 and beyond: A Q&A with Lukas_\n_Stefanko_\n\nAfter we spotted the [tweet that brought this ransomware to our radar (the researcher who](https://twitter.com/ReBensk/status/1275329926602915850)\ndiscovered it mistakenly labeled the malware as a banking trojan), we analyzed the app. We\ndiscovered a bug of the type “Improper Export of Android Components” that MITRE labels as\n[CWE-926.](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/926.html)\n\nDue to this bug, any app that is installed on the affected device can launch any exported service\n[provided by the ransomware. This allowed us to create the decryption tool – an app that launches](https://github.com/eset/cry-decryptor)\nthe decrypting functionality built into the ransomware app by its creators.\n\n## Encryption/functionality\n\nAfter launch, the ransomware requests to access files on the device. After obtaining that\npermission, it encrypts files on external media with certain extensions, which are shown in Figure\n2.\n\n_Figure 2. File extensions to be encrypted_\n\n\n-----\n\nSelected files are encrypted using AES with a randomly generated 16-character key. After\nCryCryptor encrypts a file, three new files are created, and the original file is removed. The\nencrypted file has the file extension “.enc” appended, and the algorithm generates a salt unique\nfor every encrypted file, stored with the extension “.enc.salt”; and an initialization vector,\n**“.enc.iv”**\n\n_Figure 3. Files after encryption_\n\nAfter all the target files are encrypted, CryCryptor displays a notification “Personal files encrypted,\nsee readme_now.txt”. The readme_now.txt file is placed in every directory with encrypted files.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4. File encryption notification (left) and contents of the readme_now.txt file (right)_\n\n## Decryption\n\nThe service responsible for file decryption in CryCryptor has the encryption key stored in shared\npreferences, meaning it doesn’t have to contact any C&C to retrieve it. Importantly, the service is\n[exported without any restriction in the Android Manifest (security weakness CWE-926), which](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/926.html)\nmeans it is possible to launch it externally.\n\n[Based on this, we created an Android decryption app for those affected with the CryCryptor](https://github.com/eset/cry-decryptor)\nransomware. Naturally, the decryption app works only on this version of CryCryptor.\n\n## A new ransomware family\n\nThe CryCryptor ransomware is based on open source code on GitHub. We discovered it there\nusing a simple search based on the app’s package name and a few strings that looked unique.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe developers of the open source ransomware, who named it CryDroid, must have known the\ncode would be used for malicious purposes. In an attempt to disguise the project as research,\nthey claim they uploaded the code to the VirusTotal service. While it’s unclear who uploaded the\nsample, it indeed appeared on VirusTotal the same day the code was published on GitHub.\n\n_Figure 5. The open source ransomware_\n\nWe dismiss the claim that the project has research purposes – no responsible researcher would\npublicly release a tool that is easy to misuse for malicious purposes.\n\nWe notified GitHub about the nature of this code.\n\nESET products provide protection against the CryCryptor ransomware, detecting it as\nTrojan.Android/CryCryptor.A. On top of using a quality mobile security solution, we advise Android\nusers to install apps only from reputable sources such as the Google Play store.\n\n### Timeline:\n\n[Jun 11, 2020: source code published– CryDroid v1.1](https://github.com/thelinuxchoice/crydroid)\nJun 11 2020: code uploaded to VirusTotal\n\n\n-----\n\nJun 12, 2020: first malicious domain that distributed this sample was registered\nJun 18, 2020: malicious app (this Android ransomware) was compiled (based on its\ncertificate)\nJun 21, 2020: second malicious domain that distributed this sample was registered\nJun 23, 2020: ESET informs Canadian Center for Cyber Security\nJun 23, 2020: the two domains stopped responding\n\nWe have prepared a video that that shows the process of encryption and decryption, along with\nour explanation.\n\nWatch Video At:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/llG_YFVLXyo\n\n## Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)\n\n**Package**\n**name** **Hash** **ESET detection name**\n\ncom.crydroid 322AAB72228B1A9C179696E600C1AF335B376655 Trojan.Android/CryCryptor.A\n\n### Distribution links\n\nhttps://covid19tracer[.]ca/\n\nhttps://tracershield[.]ca/\n\n## MITRE ATT&CK techniques\n\n**Tactic** **ID** **Name** **Description**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Tactic** **ID** **Name** **Description**\n\n\nInitial\nAccess\n\nInitial\nAccess\n\n\n[T1476](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1476/) Deliver\nMalicious App\nvia Other\nMeans\n\n[T1444](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1444/) Masquerade\nas Legitimate\nApplication\n\n\nPersistence [T1402](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1402/) App Auto-Start\nat Device Boot\n\nImpact [T1471](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1471/) Data\nEncrypted for\nImpact\n\n24 Jun 2020 - 12:36AM\n\n\nThe malware is downloaded from a fake website\n\nIt impersonates COVID-19 tracking app\n\nIt listens for the BOOT_COMPLETED broadcast,\nensuring that the app's functionality will be activated\nevery time the device starts\n\nEncrypts files with particular file extensions found on\nexternal media\n\n\n### Sign up to receive an email update whenever a new article is published in our Ukraine Crisis – Digital Security Resource Center\n\n Newsletter\n\n Discussion\n\n\n-----",
