I recently wrote about a self-debugging technique I found when](http://blog.malwarebytes.org/intelligence/2013/07/zeroaccess-anti-debug-uses-debugger/)\nunpacking a ZeroAccess sample.\n\nOn the other hand, RLO is a simple trick used by malware to obfuscate text strings, usually for\nthe purpose of masking file extensions. Fellow Unpacked author Jean-Taggart wrote a blog\n[about this here.](http://blog.malwarebytes.org/intelligence/2013/07/bi-directional-trickery-%E2%95%AF%E2%96%A1%E2%95%AF%EF%B8%B5-o%D7%9F%C9%B9/)\n\nWe’ve been seeing a resurgence of the RLO trick as of late in malware samples, namely a\n[signed piece of Mac malware named ‘Janicab‘ which was documented by F-secure. While this](http://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/00002576.html)\ntechnique is far from new, it might be just enough to fool the average user or junior malware\nanalyst.\n\n\n-----\n\nImage: F-Secure\n\nIn the ZeroAccess sample discovered by Sophos, the malware obfuscated the registry key\nvalue for the malware’s service, called ‘gupdate’. Implementation of RLO does not make the\nservice binary ‘GoogleUpdate.exe’ initially appear to be an EXE.\n\nImage: NakedSecurity\n\nIs RLO making a comeback? It certainly seems like it.\n\nMalware authors sometimes get lazy and recycle the same old tricks to hide their dirty deeds.\nNevertheless, the method used doesn’t always need to be complex if it gets the job done.\n\nOther simple forms of rudimentary obfuscation that’s used a lot in malware is ROT13 and\n[base64 encoding, both of which I talked about here.](http://blog.malwarebytes.org/intelligence/2013/03/obfuscation-malwares-best-friend/)\n\n[For the full article from Sophos, click here.](http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2013/07/31/zeroaccess-malware-revisited-new-version-yet-more-devious/)\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n\n[Joshua Cannell is a Malware Intelligence Analyst at Malwarebytes where he performs research](http://blog.malwarebytes.org/author/jcannell/)\nand in-depth analysis on current malware threats.
