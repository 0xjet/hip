These vulnerabilities\n\n affect the reliable operation of sensors, programmable\n\n controllers, software and networking equipment used\n\n to automate and monitor the physical processes that\n\n keep our modern world running.\n\nSince 2000, FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence has Unfortunately, security personnel from\nidentified nearly 1,600 publicly disclosed ICS manufacturing, energy, water and other\nvulnerabilities. Many of these are unpatched industries are frequently unaware of their\n— and some are simply unpatchable due to own control system assets, let alone the\n\noutdated technology —providing open paths vulnerabilities that affect them. Organizations\nfor adversarial exploitation. Nation-state cyber operating these systems are missing\nthreat actors have exploited five of these the warnings and leaving their industrial\nvulnerabilities in attacks since 2009. environments exposed.\n\nThis report highlights trends in total ICS\nvulnerability disclosures, patch availability,\nvulnerable device type and vulnerabilities\nexploited in the wild.\n\n\n-----\n\n|Col1|The discovery of Stuxnet in 2010 drove interest in industrial control systems (ICS) vulnerability research. FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence counted just 149 ICS vulnerability disclosures that were made between January 2000 and December 2010. Through April 2016, we have counted 1,552. We anticipate this upward trend will continue.|\n|---|---|\n|58%|Most (58%) of the 801 ICS-specific vulnerability disclosures since February 2013 dealt with Level 2 (L2) in the simplified Purdue ICS architecture model, which describes how manufacturing devices interface with computers. We surmise that this is because L2 software is easier to obtain than L1 devices and is more familiar to a greater number of vulnerability researchers. However, adversary access to L2 alone is generally sufficient for at-will interaction with the controlled process.|\n||Vulnerability patching presents a significant challenge. Of the 1,552 total vulnerability disclosures we examined, 516 (33%) had no vendor fixes. The lack of vendor fixes and slow patch times for most industrial environments presents a significant opportunity for potential adversaries.|\n||Through April 2016, at least five ICS-specific vulnerabilities have been exploited in the wild, a rate we anticipate will increase in the future.|\n||In light of these observations and trends, we recommend that ICS asset owners: • Prepare their security teams with an accurate understanding of control system assets, their locations, and functions. • Obtain structured vulnerability and patch feeds that cover a wide variety of sources. • Match the vulnerability disclosures and patch announcements against their asset inventory. • Track vulnerable and unpatched products currently used in their industrial environments. • Prioritize vulnerability remediation efforts by considering ICS architecture location, simplicity of exploitation and possible impact on the controlled industrial process.|\n\n\n-----\n\n#### METHODOLOGY\n\nFor the purpose of this report, ICS-specific vulnerability\ndisclosures consist of a vulnerability announcement\nwhere 1) a disclosing party specifically examined\nproducts intended to aid in the operation of an industrial\nprocess, and 2) exploitation of the vulnerability has a\ndistinct impact on the controlled industrial process.\n\n- We do not count a disclosure unless it names\n\na specific product.\n\n- We exclude general purpose operating systems,\n\nsuch as Microsoft Windows, even though human\nmachine interfaces (HMIs), engineering laptops and\nsupervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)\nservers commonly use them. We also exclude database\napplications, such as Oracle and SQL Server, even\nthough control system applications and historians\ncommonly incorporate them. Parties disclosing\nvulnerabilities in these products have not generally\ndone so with ICS in mind.\n\n- By the same reasoning, we excluded major\n\nthird-party software vulnerabilities/attacks, including\nPOODLE, Heartbleed, and Shellshock, though a variety\nof ICS-specific software exhibits these issues.\n\n- Further, if a researcher discloses a vulnerability that\n\naffects multiple products that have different uses\nin an industrial environment, and those uses lead to\ndiffering impacts on the controlled process, we count\nthem separately. For example, if a researcher discloses\na vulnerability in an OPC server (a type of process\ncontroller) library the vendor bundles into both a\nhistorian and an engineering workstation,\nwe count this as two disclosures because successful\nexploitation can lead to distinct process impacts.\n\n- Additionally, we have not independently confirmed\n\nthe accuracy of the disclosures or the efficacy of\nassociated patches.\n\n\n###### BY THE NUMBERS\n\n\n### 1,552\n\n 123\n\n 15\n\n 33\n\n 90\n\n 465\n\n\nNumber of ICS SPECIFIC\n**VULNERABILITIES we analyzed**\n\n**TOTAL NUMBER OF VENDORS**\naffected by vulnerability disclosures\n\n**YEARS OF DISCLOSURES**\nin our research\n\n**PERCENTAGE OF VULNERABILITIES**\nwithout a patch at time of disclosure\n\n**PERCENTAGE OF VULNERABILITIES**\nin our data set disclosed after Stuxnet\nemerged in media reports in mid-2010\n\n**NUMBER OF DISCLOSURES impacting**\nLevel 2 of the simplified Purdue model,\nwhich typically includes SCADA systems\n\n\n-----\n\n#### ICS-SPECIFIC VULNERABILITY  DISCLOSURES  OVER TIME\n\n###### STUXNET DROVE INTEREST IN ICS-SPECIFIC VULNERABILITIES\n\nAn examination of 1,490 ICS-specific vulnerability\ndisclosures between 2000 and 2015 (see Figure 1) shows\na sharp increase in 2011. We believe the media attention\ngarnered by Stuxnet is the principal driver of the increase:\n\n- Stuxnet was the first publicly recognized attack to exploit\nvulnerabilities in ICS products.[1] Media coverage began in\nmid-2010 and continued for the next 18 months.\n\n- There was a general slow upward trend prior to 2010,\nwhich itself saw just 55 ICS vulnerability disclosures.\n\n- 2011 included 219 ICS vulnerability disclosures,\nrepresenting a 300% growth from 2010.\n\n- Most (90%) of the vulnerabilities came after 2010, though\nthat accounts for only one-third of the timeline.\n\n- While the Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency\nResponse Team (ICS-CERT), which coordinates\nvulnerability disclosures between researchers and vendors,\nformally launched in November 2009, may have had\nsome effect on disclosure rates, we consider that effect\nsecondary because CERT/CC effectively coordinated ICSspecific vulnerability disclosures before that date.\n\n\n###### AVERAGE YEARLY DISCLOSURES LIKELY TO INCREASE, BUT NOT AT 2015 RATE\n\nWe identify another sharp increase from 2014 to 2015—\nwhen disclosures rose from 249 to 371, or by 49%. Prior to\nthis (from 2011 to 2014), disclosures rose an average of just\n4.7% annually.\n\nWe anticipate that the average number of ICS-specific\nvulnerability disclosures will increase during the next\nseveral years at about the rate it did from 2011 to 2014\n(5%) rather than the rate in 2015 (49%).\n\nWe surmise that the 2015 increase represents an\nanomalous spike rather than a new threshold because 92\nof the vulnerabilities were caused by two large groups of\ndisclosures that vendors released at a single time: 56 from\nOSIsoft and 36 from Yokogawa.[2,3]\n\n- The size of these vendor releases are anomalous in the\ndata set. The next largest group of disclosures by a\nvendor was 12 in 2014.\n\n- Releasing a set of vulnerabilities — versus one-by-one\nas they are likely discovered — indicates that the vendor\nmay be choosing to address them all at once rather than\nserially. Vendors may believe that a group and disclose\napproach enhances marketing of new releases, but we\nhave yet to determine whether this approach is a trend.\n\n- We suggest the Yokogawa vulnerabilities may have\nbeen discovered simultaneously because they dealt with\nsimilar buffer overflows, but affected multiple products.\n\n\n400\n\n350\n\n300\n\n250\n\n200\n\n150\n\n100\n\n50\n\n0\n\n\n**FIGURE 1: ICS -SPECIFIC VULNERABILIT Y DISCLOSURES BY YEAR**\n\nTWO -YEAR ROLLING AVER AGE\n\n2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015\n\n\n1 Keizer, Greg. “Is Stuxnet the ‘best’ malware ever?” Infoworld. 16 September 2010. http://www.infoworld.com/article/2626009/malware/is-stuxnet-the--best--malware-ever-.html\n\n2 OSISoft.

We classify industrial networking equipment\n(normally hardened to withstand harsh temperatures,\nvibration and dust) in another category.\n\n**FIGURE 2: SIMPLIFIED PURDUE MODEL OF AN INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEM**\n\n###### SCADA\n\n\n###### CORPORATE\n\n\n###### DMZ\n\n\n###### PLC & RTU\n\n\n###### SENSORS & ACTUATORS\n\n\nInter/Intranet\n\nApplications\nintended to\nprovide remote\nICS functionality\nrelying on the\npublic internet,\nsuch as mobile\ndevice apps\n\n|PLC RTU|Col2|Sensors Actuators|\n|---|---|---|\n\n\nMeets general\ncomputing needs,\nincluding email,\ndatabases, and\nword\nprocessing\n\n\n###### Zone 4 Zone 3\n\n\n###### Zone 1 Zone 0\n\n\nMakes data and\napplications\nfrom the control\nnetwork available\nto users outside\nof the control\nnetwork\n\n\nNetworking Networking\nDevices Devices\n\nHistorian\n\nOther\n\n###### Zone 2\n\nAllows a human\noperator to\nsupervise\nand control the\nphysical process\n\n\nUses sensor\nreadings to send\nappropriate\ncommands to\nactuators and\nmotors\n\n\nSenses process\ncharacteristics,\nsuch as\ntemperature,\npressure, and\nlevel; opens and\ncloses valves; and\nturns pumps and\nmotors on or off\n\n\n4 The Simplified Purdue model refers to a framework developed by researchers to describe the interconnectivity of computers to manufacturing systems.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### MOST DISCLOSURES AFFECT LEVEL 2 PROBABLY BECAUSE OF RESEARCHER’S FAMILIARITY WITH THE SYSTEMS AND THE PRODUCT’S AVAILABILITY\n\nAbout half (465 of the 801 vulnerability disclosures from\nFebruary 2013 to April 2016) affect products at ICS\narchitecture Level 2 (as shown in Figure 3). We believe\nLevel 2 has received the most attention because:\n\n- Equipment in this level frequently relies on operating\nsystems, databases, and other information technologies\nalready familiar to vulnerability researchers; and\n\n- Technologies used at this level can be easily\nand inexpensively obtained by vulnerability\nresearchers, such as limited-time, full-featured\ndemonstration versions.\n\n\n###### ACCESS TO LEVEL 2 ALLOWS  A THREAT ACTOR TO MANIPULATE PROCESSES\n\nOnce an attacker has unrestricted access to\nLevel 2, further exploits and vulnerabilities\nbecome less important because:\n\n- Devices that directly control the processes, such as HMI\nand engineering workstations, reside here. Like having\na master key, controlling one of those devices gives\nattackers control of any connected processes.\nFor example, as seen in the attacks on the Ukrainian\npower companies in December 2014, once attackers\nhave access to the HMI, they can open and close\nswitches and actuators at will without exploiting\nadditional vulnerabilities.\n\n- Using unauthenticated protocols allows any computer\nconnected to these networks to interact with\nthe controlled process. For instance, the use\nof Modbus/TCP allows any device on the network\nto alter a set point within the process logic\nexecuted by the controller.\n\n\n500\n\n400\n\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\n0\n\n\n**FIGURE 3: ICS -SPECIFIC VULNERABILIT Y DISCLOSURES AFFECTING EACH LEVEL FROM FEBRUARY 2013 TO APRIL 2016**\n\n**(VULNERABILITIES MAY AFFECT MORE THAN ONE ZONE)**\n\nZone 0 Zone 1 Zone 2 Zone 3 Zone 4 Zone 5 Networking\nDevices\n\n\n-----\n\n2016\n\nOf the 1,552 total vulnerabilities we examined, 516 did\nnot have a fix available at the time of public disclosure\n(as shown in Figure 4). This means that 33% were zero-\nday vulnerabilities.

We are aware of five ICS-specific vulnerabilities exploited in the\nwild (as shown in Figure 5). In addition, given the growth in researcher interest, we surmise that many\nother ICS-specific vulnerabilities have been exploited in the past, but have not been made public.\n\n**FIGURE 5: FIVE ICS VULNERABILITIES EXPLOITED IN THE WILD**\n\n|VULNERABILITY TITLE|ATTACK|KNOWN VICTIMS|EXPLOITED|VULNERABILITY DISCLOSED|PATCH RELEASED|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Siemens Simatic S7 DLL loading mechanism vulnerability5|Stuxnet|NEDA Industrial Group, Natanz, Iran|July 2009|June 2010|September 2011|\n|Siemens WinCC insecure SQL Server authentication6|Stuxnet|NEDA Industrial Group, Natanz, Iran|July 2009|June 2010|July 2012|\n|GE Cimplicity Path Traversal7,8|Attributed to the Sandworm Team|Various|January 2012|June 2012|December 2013|\n|Moxa UC-7408-LX Plus unauthenticated firmware9,10|Attributed to the Sandworm Team|Kyivo-blenergo Energy Distribution Facility, Ukraine|December 2015|May 2016|Product Discontinued|\n|IRZ RUH2 3G unauthenticated firmware11|Attributed to the Sandworm Team|Prykarpattya-oblenergo Energy Distirbution Facility, Ukraine|December 2015|May 2016|N/A|\n\n\n###### EXPLOITATION OF ICS-SPECIFIC VULNERABILITIES TO ACCRUE\n AT SLOW RATE\n\nWe note that all five instances in which ICS-specific\nvulnerabilities were exploited can be reasonably tied\nto nation-state actors. Four of the five — Stuxnet\nand the attacks in Ukraine — can be tied to direct\ngeopolitical objectives. The success of these incidents\nin compromising key systems to achieve a political\nobjective or demonstrating an adversary’s capabilities\nmakes us expect that nation-state adversaries will\nincreasingly exploit ICS-specific vulnerabilities.\n\n\n###### SANDWORM TEAM UNDERMINES THREE UKRAINIAN ELECTRICITY DISTRIBUTORS\n IN LATE 2015\n\nOn Dec. 23, 2015, three Ukrainian electricity distributors\nfound themselves at ground zero for ICS security. A cyber\nthreat group — that we strongly believe is the suspected\nRussia-based Sandworm Team — had invaded systems\nand triggered power outages across three regions in\nwestern Ukraine.\n\nThe attackers systemically shut down the flow of\nelectricity by manipulating distribution system dispatcher\nHMIs — the applications that grid operators use to\ncontrol the flow of power to homes and businesses.\nAfter shutting down the power, attackers exploited two\npreviously unknown vulnerabilities in control systems\nnetworking gear to inhibit the utilities’ ability to restore\npower and maintain control of the grid.\n\n\n5 Symanec. “W32.Stuxnet Dossier.” February 2011. https://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/w32_stuxnet_dossier.pdf.
