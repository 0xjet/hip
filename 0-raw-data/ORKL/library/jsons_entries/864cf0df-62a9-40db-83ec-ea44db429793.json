Unfortunately, there is no free decryption tool available at the moment and the\nmalware makes sure to remove the file shadows created by Windows.\n\nSecurity researcher Mol69 noticed that the file-encrypting malware is now a payload in\nmalvertising campaigns from RIG exploit kit (EK).\n\nThe malware used the .nemty extension for the encrypted files but the variant observed by\nMol69 adds '._NEMTY_Lct5F3C_' at the end of the processed files.\n\n[#Malvertising ->](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Malvertising?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [#RIGEK ->](https://twitter.com/hashtag/RIGEK?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [#NEMTY](https://twitter.com/hashtag/NEMTY?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [(#Ransomware)](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ransomware?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n[Extention]\n._NEMTY_Lct5F3C_\n\n[Example Payloadhttps://t.co/eZk2oFZ1t9@anyrun_app](https://t.co/eZk2oFZ1t9) [@EKFiddle](https://twitter.com/EKFiddle?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [@adrian__luca](https://twitter.com/adrian__luca?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n[@jeromesegura](https://twitter.com/jeromesegura?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [@nao_sec](https://twitter.com/nao_sec?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [@david_jursa](https://twitter.com/david_jursa?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [pic.twitter.com/HJngPRBKBW](https://t.co/HJngPRBKBW)\n\n[— mol69 (@tkanalyst) August 31, 2019](https://twitter.com/tkanalyst/status/1167818997519151105?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nIn the ransom note shown after encrypting the files, Nemty provides instructions on how to\npay to recover the data.\n\nIn the ransom note is also an encrypted version of the key that unlocks the files on the\ninfected computer, and decrypting it is controlled by the malware administrators.\n\n## Suspicious community\n\n[Mol69 rolled the infection chain in an AnyRun test environment that documents all of the](https://app.any.run/tasks/c4c56bb5-0e57-43b7-92b0-a8c6bf8596a0/)\nsteps leading to the file encryption process. The entire activity took over 10 minutes to\nfinish.\n\nNemty is new on the scene and on at least one underground forum it was received with\nskepticism. This is not unusual with new ransomware, BleepingComputer learned from\n[Yelisey Boguslavskiy, director of security research at Advanced Intelligence (AdvIntel).](https://www.advanced-intel.com/)\n\nThis was not the case of Sodinokibi, though, whose administrators are suspected to be from\n[the old GandCrab gang. Sodinokibi ransomware received immediate support from high-](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/a-look-inside-the-highly-profitable-sodinokibi-ransomware-business/)\nprofile members of the forum.\n\nFurthermore, its profitability only enticed spirits and prompted malware distributors to jump\nat the opportunity of partnering up. However, Sodinokibi operators are very selective and\nassociated only with individuals considered veterans in the field.\n\nNemty, on the other hand, did not enjoy a warm welcome in the community.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware asks $5 million to unlock Austrian state](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/blackcat-alphv-ransomware-asks-5-million-to-unlock-austrian-state/)\n\n[Windows 11 KB5014019 breaks Trend Micro ransomware protection](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-11-kb5014019-breaks-trend-micro-ransomware-protection/)\n\n[Industrial Spy data extortion market gets into the ransomware game](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/industrial-spy-data-extortion-market-gets-into-the-ransomware-game/)\n\n[New ‘Cheers’ Linux ransomware targets VMware ESXi servers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-cheers-linux-ransomware-targets-vmware-esxi-servers/)\n\n[SpiceJet airline passengers stranded after ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/spicejet-airline-passengers-stranded-after-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[Encryption Keys](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/encryption-keys/)\n[Nemty Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/nemty-ransomware/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n[RIG](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/rig/)\n\n[Ionut Ilascu](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/ionut-ilascu/)\n\nIonut Ilascu is a technology writer with a focus on all things cybersecurity.
