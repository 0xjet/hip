Notable attack vectors include\nTrickbot and Cobalt Strike (see below for details).\n\nWhile there are no specific or credible cyber threats to the U.S. homeland at this time, CISA,\nFBI, and NSA encourage organizations to review this advisory and apply the recommended\nmitigations.\n\n**_(end of update)_**\n\nThe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation (FBI) have observed the increased use of Conti ransomware in more than 400\nattacks on U.S. and international organizations. (See FBI Flash: Conti Ransomware Attacks\nImpact Healthcare and First Responder Networks.) In typical Conti ransomware attacks,\nmalicious cyber actors steal files, encrypt servers and workstations, and demand a ransom\npayment.\n\nTo secure systems against Conti ransomware, CISA, FBI, and the National Security Agency\n(NSA) recommend implementing the mitigation measures described in this Advisory, which\ninclude requiring multifactor authentication (MFA), implementing network segmentation, and\nkeeping operating systems and software up to date.\n\n[Click here for a PDF version of this report.](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/AA21-265A-Conti_Ransomware_TLP_WHITE.pdf)\n\n[Click here for indicators of compromise (IOCs) in STIX format.](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/AA21-265A.stix.xml)\n\n**_Note: This Alert uses the MITRE Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge_**\n_(ATT&CK®) framework, version 9.

It is likely\nthat Conti developers pay the deployers of the ransomware a wage rather than a percentage\nof the proceeds used by affiliate cyber actors and receives a share of the proceeds from a\nsuccessful attack.\n\n[Conti actors often gain initial access [TA0001] to networks through:](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/tactics/TA0001/)\n\nSpearphishing campaigns using tailored emails that contain malicious attachments\n\n[[T1566.001] or malicious links [T1566.002];](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/techniques/T1566/001/)\n\nMalicious Word attachments often contain embedded scripts that can be used to\ndownload or drop other malware—such as TrickBot and IcedID, and/or Cobalt\nStrike—to assist with lateral movement and later stages of the attack life cycle\n[with the eventual goal of deploying Conti ransomware.

CISA and FBI have\nobserved Conti actors using Router Scan, a penetration testing tool, to maliciously scan for\n[and brute force [T1110] routers, cameras, and network-attached storage devices with web](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/techniques/T1110/)\n[interfaces. Additionally, actors use Kerberos attacks [T1558.003] to attempt to get the Admin](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/techniques/T1558/003/)\nhash to conduct brute force attacks.\n\nConti actors are known to exploit legitimate remote monitoring and management software\n[and remote desktop software as backdoors to maintain persistence [TA0003] on victim](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/tactics/TA0003/)\n[networks.[5] The actors use tools already available on the victim network—and, as needed,](https://ransomwaredaily.com/conti-ransomware-gang-playbook-mentions-msp-software-channele2e/)\nadd additional tools, such as Windows Sysinternals and Mimikatz—to obtain users’ hashes\n[and clear-text credentials, which enable the actors to escalate privileges [TA0004] within a](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/tactics/TA0004/)\n[domain and perform other post-exploitation and lateral movement tasks [TA0008].

Consider using a centralized patch management system.\n\n**Remove unnecessary applications and apply controls.**\n\nRemove any application not deemed necessary for day-to-day operations. Conti threat\nactors leverage legitimate applications—such as remote monitoring and management\nsoftware and remote desktop software applications—to aid in the malicious exploitation\nof an organization’s enterprise.\nInvestigate any unauthorized software, particularly remote desktop or remote\nmonitoring and management software.\nImplement application allowlisting, which only allows systems to execute programs\nknown and permitted by the organization's security policy. Implement software\nrestriction policies (SRPs) or other controls to prevent programs from executing from\ncommon ransomware locations, such as temporary folders supporting popular internet\nbrowsers or compression/decompression programs.\nImplement execution prevention by disabling macro scripts from Microsoft Office files\ntransmitted via email. Consider using Office Viewer software to open Microsoft Office\nfiles transmitted via email instead of full Microsoft Office suite applications.\n[See the joint Alert, Publicly Available Tools Seen in Cyber Incidents Worldwide—](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/AA18-284A)\ndeveloped by CISA and the cybersecurity authorities of Australia, Canada, New\nZealand, and the United Kingdom—for guidance on detection and protection against\nmalicious use of publicly available tools.\n\n**Implement endpoint and detection response tools.**\n\nEndpoint and detection response tools allow a high degree of visibility into the security\nstatus of endpoints and can help effectively protect against malicious cyber actors.\n\n**Limit access to resources over the network, especially by restricting RDP.**\n\nAfter assessing risks, if RDP is deemed operationally necessary, restrict the originating\nsources and require multifactor authentication.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Secure user accounts.**\n\nRegularly audit administrative user accounts and configure access controls under the\nprinciples of least privilege and separation of duties.\nRegularly audit logs to ensure new accounts are legitimate users.\n\nReview CISA’s [APTs Targeting IT Service Provider Customers guidance for additional](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/APTs-Targeting-IT-Service-Provider-Customers)\nmitigations specific to IT Service Providers and their customers.\n\n**Use the Ransomware Response Checklist in case of infection.**\n\nIf a ransomware incident occurs at your organization, CISA, FBI, and NSA recommend the\nfollowing actions:\n\n**Follow the Ransomware Response Checklist on p. 11 of the** CISA-Multi-State\nInformation Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) Joint Ransomware Guide.\n**Scan your backups.
