In December](https://www.riskiq.com/blog/labs/cobalt-strike/)\nthey were already setting up for their next campaign. Today, on January 16th, the first wave of spear\nphishing emails were delivered to the inboxes of Russian banks. Sadly, this time around, the group didn’t\n[forget to BCC.](https://twitter.com/ydklijnsma/status/846766178093731840)\n\nThe emails were sent in the name of a large European bank in an attempt to social engineer the receiver\ninto trusting the email.
