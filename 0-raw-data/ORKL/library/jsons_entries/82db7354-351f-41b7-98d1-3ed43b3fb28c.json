NATO Allies support and stand in solidarity with the United States, following its 15\n\nApril announcement of actions to respond to Russia’s destabilising activities. Allies are\ntaking actions individually and collectively to enhance the Alliance’s collective security.\n\n2. Russia continues to demonstrate a sustained pattern of destabilising behaviour,\n\nincluding its violations of Ukraine’s and Georgia’s sovereignty and territorial integrity,\nand continued violation, non-implementation, and circumvention of numerous\ninternational obligations and commitments, including the Budapest Memorandum.\nExamples include attempted interference in Allied elections, including the U.S.\npresidential election; widespread disinformation campaigns; and malicious cyber\nactivities. The United States and other Allies assess that all available evidence points\nto the responsibility of the Russian Federation for the SolarWinds hack. We stand in\nsolidarity with the United States. We condemn the attack on Alexei Navalny, a\nRussian opposition figure, with the use of a nerve agent from the banned Novichok\ngroup. Any use of chemical weapons, under any circumstances, is a clear breach of\ninternational law and contrary to the Chemical Weapons Convention. Reports that\nRussia encouraged attacks against U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan are also of\nconcern.\n\n3. Allies will continue to work in close consultation to address Russia’s actions, which\n\nconstitute a threat to Euro-Atlantic security. We call on Russia to cease immediately\nits destabilising behaviour, and to uphold its international obligations, as Allies do\ntheirs, including existing arms control, disarmament, and non-proliferation agreements\nand commitments. We also call on Russia to cease its provocations and to\nimmediately de-escalate tensions on Ukraine’s borders and in illegally-annexed\nCrimea.\n\n4. While we continue to ensure our deterrence and defence posture, NATO remains\n\nopen to periodic, focused, and meaningful dialogue, and to a constructive relationship\nwith Russia when Russia’s actions make that possible. We regret that Russia\ncontinues to disregard NATO’s early 2020 invitation to hold a meeting of the NATORussia Council.\n\nBack To Top\n\n\n-----",
