After researchers found samples, it was determined](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/darkside-ransomware-gang-returns-as-new-blackmatter-operation/)\nthat the encryption routines used by the ransomware were the same custom and unique\nones used by DarkSide.\n\n[DarkSide shut down after attacking and shutting down Colonial Pipeline and then feeling](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/largest-us-pipeline-shuts-down-operations-after-ransomware-attack/)\nthe total pressure of international enforcement and the US government.\n\nFrom the sample BlackMatter's Linux encryptor shared with BleepingComputer, it is clear\nthat it was designed solely to target VMWare ESXi servers.\n\nAdvanced Intel's [Vitali Kremez](https://twitter.com/VK_Intel) [reverse engineered the sample and told BleepingComputer](https://twitter.com/VK_Intel/status/1423188690126266370)\nthat the threat actors created an 'esxi_utils' library that is used to perform various operations\non VMware ESXi servers\n```\n/sbin/esxcli\nbool app::esxi_utils::get_domain_name(std::vector >&)\nbool app::esxi_utils::get_running_vms(std::vector >&)\nbool app::esxi_utils::get_process_list(std::vector >&)\nbool app::esxi_utils::get_os_version(std::vector >&)\nbool app::esxi_utils::get_storage_list(std::vector >&)\nstd::string app::esxi_utils::get_machine_uuid()\nbool app::esxi_utils::stop_firewall()\nbool app::esxi_utils::stop_vm(const string&)\n\n```\nKremez told us that each function would execute a different command using the esxcli\ncommand-line management tool, such as listing VMs, stopping the firewall, stopping a VM,\nand more.\n\nFor example, stop_firewall() function will execute the following command:\n```\nesxcli network firewall set --enabled false\n\n```\nWhile the stop_vm() will execute the following esxcli command:\n```\nesxcli vm process kill --type=force --world-id [ID]\n\n```\nAll ransomware that targets ESXi servers attempts to shut down virtual machines before\nencrypting the drives. This is done to prevent data from being corrupted while it is\nencrypted.\n\nOnce all the VMs are shut down, it will encrypt files that match specific file extensions\nbased on the configuration included with the ransomware.\n\n\n-----\n\nTargeting ESXi servers is very efficient when conducting ransomware attacks, as it allows\nthe threat actors to encrypt numerous servers at once with a single command.\n\nAs more businesses move to this type of platform for their servers, we will continue to see\nransomware developers focus primarily on Windows machines but also create a dedicated\nLinux encrypted targeting ESXi.\n\nEmsisoft CTO Fabian Wosar told BleepingComputer that other ransomware operations,\nsuch as [REvil,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/revil-ransomwares-new-linux-encryptor-targets-esxi-virtual-machines/) [HelloKitty, Babuk,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/linux-version-of-hellokitty-ransomware-targets-vmware-esxi-servers/) [RansomExx/Defray, Mespinoza, GoGoogle, have also](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomexx-ransomware-also-encrypts-linux-systems/)\ncreated Linux encryptors for this purpose.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Hive ransomware ports its Linux VMware ESXi encryptor to Rust](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hive-ransomware-ports-its-linux-vmware-esxi-encryptor-to-rust/)\n\n[New ‘Cheers’ Linux ransomware targets VMware ESXi servers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-cheers-linux-ransomware-targets-vmware-esxi-servers/)\n\n[Beware: Onyx ransomware destroys files instead of encrypting them](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/beware-onyx-ransomware-destroys-files-instead-of-encrypting-them/)\n\n[Karakurt revealed as data extortion arm of Conti cybercrime syndicate](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/karakurt-revealed-as-data-extortion-arm-of-conti-cybercrime-syndicate/)\n\n[Shutterfly services disrupted by Conti ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/shutterfly-services-disrupted-by-conti-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[BlackMatter](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/blackmatter/)\n[DarkSide](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/darkside/)\n[Encryptor](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/encryptor/)\n[Linux](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/linux/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n[Server](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/server/)\n[Virtual Machine](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/virtual-machine/)\n[Vmware ESXi](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/vmware-esxi/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
