Two of the\n[attacks targeted the POS systems of North American fuel dispenser merchants. PFD recently reported](https://usa.visa.com/dam/VCOM/global/support-legal/documents/visa-security-alert-attacks-targeting-fuel-dispenser-merchant-pos.pdf) on\nthe observed increase of POS attacks against fuel dispenser merchants, and it is likely these merchants\n**are an increasingly attractive target for cybercrime groups. Track 1 and track 2 payment card data**\n**was at risk in the merchant’s POS environments due to the lack of secure acceptance technology,**\n**(e.g. EMV® Chip, Point-to-Point Encryption, Tokenization, etc.) and non-compliance with PCI DSS.**\n\nThe activity detailed in this alert highlights continued targeting of POS systems, as well as targeted\ninterest in compromising fuel dispenser merchants to obtain track data.\n\n### 1. Threat Description \n\nIn the first incident, PFD analyzed the compromise of a North American fuel dispenser merchant. The\nthreat actors compromised the merchant via a phishing email sent to an employee. The email contained a\nmalicious link that, when clicked, installed a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) on the merchant network and\ngranted the threat actors network access. The actors then conducted reconnaissance of the corporate\nnetwork, and obtained and utilized credentials to move laterally into the POS environment. There was also\na lack of network segmentation between the Cardholder Data Environment (CDE) and corporate network,\nwhich enabled lateral movement. Once the POS environment was successfully accessed, a Random Access\nMemory (RAM) scraper was deployed on the POS system to harvest payment card data.\n\nThe following indicators of compromise (IOCs) are associated with the attack against this North American\nfuel dispenser merchant:\n\n\n-----\n\nVisa Payment Fraud Disruption\n\n**Filename** psemon10.dll\n**Exported DLL Name** psemonitor_x86.dll\n**Source** [Virus Total](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/cc5b3904458b144c5f263f47a3dffc9628ecdccab993bf7e01d345f496692c1a/detection)\n**MD5** 19d38325f715f623bd4b6e819a150cde\n**SHA1** 15f34ce2e4a9c8bbeb6fa243d70d587f7a627ece\n**SHA256** cc5b3904458b144c5f263f47a3dffc9628ecdccab993bf7e01d345f496692c1a\n**SSdeep** 384:nOZZmnD/R1EuVbtOWm/WzA3eaRrG2b44JR8kFvbWMz1DuDetv8fQYNRcAIoGlRt:OqQu\nNts3/Rq20s9dWyDPtRYXc1Rb\n\nIn a second incident, PFD identified a different compromise of another North American fuel dispenser\nmerchant wherein threat actors targeted the merchant’s POS environment. The actors again obtained\nnetwork access to the targeted merchant, although it is unclear how the actors gained this initial access,\nand moved laterally within the network to the POS environment. A RAM scraper was injected into the POS\nenvironment and was used to harvest payment card data. The targeted merchant accepted both chip\ntransactions at the in-store terminals and magnetic stripe transactions at fuel pumps, and the malware\ninjected into the POS environment appears to have targeted the mag stripe/track data specifically.\nTherefore, the payment cards used at the non-chip fuel pumps were at risk in the POS environment.\n\nForensic analysis of the targeted network identified numerous indicators of compromise (IOCs) that can\n[likely be attributed to the cybercrime group known as FIN8. FIN8 is a financially motivated threat group](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0061/)\nactive since at least 2016 and often targets the POS environments of retail, restaurant, and hospitality\nmerchants to harvest payment account data. Among the IOCs recovered are command and control (C2)\ndomains previously used by FIN8 in threat activity. The malware used in the attack also created a\ntemporary output file, wmsetup.tmp, which was used to house the scraped payment data. This file was\npreviously identified in attacks attributed to FIN8 and FIN8-associated malware.\n\nThe following IOCs are associated with this attack:\n\n**C2s** Troxymuntisex[.]org (162.243.40[.]7)\nNduropasture[.]net (192.64.119[.]98)\nDiolucktrens[.]org (157.230.233[.]65)\nFraserdolx[.]org (134.209.78[.]73)\n\nIn a third incident, PFD conducted analysis on malware recovered from the network of a compromised\nNorth American hospitality merchant. The analysis determined that the compromise was likely the result\n[of an operation conducted by the cybercrime group FIN8. The attack used a FIN8-attributed](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0197/) malware, but\nalso used new malware not previously seen employed by the group in the wild. The new malware is a full[featured shellcode backdoor that is based on the RM3 variant of the Ursnif](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0386/) (aka Gozi/Gozi-ISFB) modular\nbanking malware. While the malware used in this attack was not identified in the attacks against the fuel\ndispenser merchants, it is possible FIN8 will use this malware in future operations targeting fuel dispenser\nmerchants.\n\nThe following IOCs are associated with this compromise:\n\n\n-----\n\nVisa Payment Fraud Disruption\n\n**Filename** mxSlipStream3.exe\n**MD5** 5d4b9106c9911854b59c8891b40f29c0\n**SHA1** 3187aa12119ef31d2f1e03af0adf5d9a9e3c45fd\n**SHA256** 3a934f3cea6f9aff894eafd6e25ed01a93ef7dc4f7a16e2ade2da9f12060908f\n**SSdeep** 1536:6w4fpS/nSciztM74N0DIDidcLbIA97Zn2eZe+1hRMVSsgm5:6w4gnScGuDI2dcjd2efHRuR5\n**Note** Nullsoft Installer-Based Loader\n\n**Filename** 631081634\n**MD5** ede53b0ce6f3f3410b9f9595923fa2d4\n**SHA1** b038e0518162881af4c2584d8b4967e85bad3a77\n**SHA256** a7e41affb12e8e5c5e54cf9eb73104fb2069fb020eb2bf741f646f32b04d803a\n**SSdeep** 384:hhicRs1D0pxnVXKmEnRj4gHRF5sQoURZ6qWFFkWoQxqt4CnJmnOjyEPiFa3EXx+H:3i31D0pxnNAnRj3\nHdsQoUIFF/oMEAOjb\n**Note** Encoded or Encrypted Data\n\n**Source** [Virus Total](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/431f83b1af8ab7754615adaef11f1d10201edfef4fc525811c2fcda7605b5f2e/detection)\n**MD5** 30c23ec53a3443b6d53a6c8ad29cbcc8\n**SHA1** 0b18ea041f8b467158b96ab8c655e97329b95a45\n**SHA256** 431f83b1af8ab7754615adaef11f1d10201edfef4fc525811c2fcda7605b5f2e\n**SSdeep** 1536:ih5JdoIB8i6rAsm3m0I1H6WHZR8YTCUz6eIQ+rIvBH2jrz6Q:6jdoUxIg33A6W55TCO6eIQ+rIR2L\n**Note** Ursnif_Variant\n\n**Metasploit Bind TCP Stager** 0.0.0.0:8443\n**TINYMET Meterpreter Stagers** 185.159.131[.]11:443\n45.77.152[.]39:443\n45.77.152[.]39:80\n\n### 2. Conclusion\n\n[PFD reported](https://usa.visa.com/dam/VCOM/global/support-legal/documents/fin6-cybercrime-group-expands-threat-To-ecommerce-merchants.pdf) in February 2019 that an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group expanded their operations\nto eCommerce merchants. While it is expected that APTs and other financially motivated threat actor(s)\nwill continue to target eCommerce environments, the recent attacks display a continued interest in\nobtaining track data from targeted brick-and-mortar merchants. Additionally, the recent compromises of\nfuel dispenser merchants represents a concerning trend whereby sophisticated threat groups have\nidentified fuel dispenser merchants as an attractive target for obtaining track data.\n\nIt is important to note that this attack vector differs significantly from skimming at fuel pumps, as the\ntargeting of POS systems requires the threat actors to access the merchant’s internal network, and takes\nmore technical prowess than skimming attacks. Fuel dispenser merchants should take note of this activity\nand deploy devices that support chip wherever possible, as this will significantly lower the likelihood of\nthese attacks. PFD assesses that fuel dispenser merchants will continue to be an attractive target for\nsophisticated threat actors motivated by obtaining track data from POS systems.\n\n\n-----\n\nVisa Payment Fraud Disruption\n\n### Recommendations for Issuers and Acquirers\n\nVisa recommends merchants and acquirers take the following actions to mitigate against these threats:\n\n    - **Employ the IOCs contained in this report to detect, remediate, and prevent attacks using** the\nPOS malware variant.\n\n    - **Secure remote access with strong passwords, ensure only the necessary individuals have**\npermission for remote access, disable remote access when not in use, and use two-factor\nauthentication for remote sessions.\n\n    - **Enable EMV technologies for secure in-person payments (chip, contactless, mobile and QR**\ncode).\n\n    - **Provide each Admin user with their own user credentials. User accounts should also only**\nbe provided with the permissions vital to job responsibilities.\n\n    - **Turn on heuristics (behavioral analysis) on anti-malware to search for suspicious behavior,**\nand update anti-malware applications.\n\n    - **Monitor network traffic for suspicious connections, and log system and network events.**\n\n    - **Implement Network Segmentation,** where possible, to prevent the spread of malicious\nsoftware and limit an attacker’s foothold.\n\n    - **Maintain a patch management program and update all software and hardware firmware to**\nmost current release to limit the attack surface for zero-day vulnerabilities.\n\n    - **In the event of a confirmed or suspected breach, refer to Visa’s What to do if** _Compromised_\n_(WTDIC), published October 2019._\n\nRefer to the following resources for more information on security standards, PCI compliance\nrequirements, and best practices:\n\n    - PCI Data Security Standard Quick Reference Guide\n\n    - Refer to Visa’s Card Acceptance Guidelines for Visa Merchants\n\n    - Additional information on PCI DSS can be found at www.pcissc.org\n\n**Contact Information**\n\n[For more information, please contact paymentintelligence@visa.com](mailto:paymentintelligence@visa.com)\n\n**_Disclaimer:_**\n_This report is intended for informational purposes only and should not be relied upon for operational, marketing, legal,_\n_technical, tax, financial or other advice.
