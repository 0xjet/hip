We condemn them in the strongest possible terms.\n\nThe UK will continue to work with our allies to call out and counter future malicious\ncyber attacks.\n\nThe UK has already acted against the GRU’s destructive cyber unit by working with\ninternational partners to impose asset freezes and travel bans against its members through\nthe EU cyber sanctions regime.\n\nToday (Monday 19 October), the US Department of Justice has announced criminal charges\nagainst Russian military intelligence officers working for the GRU’s destructive cyber unit –\nalso known by the codenames Sandworm and VoodooBear – for conducting cyber attacks\nagainst the 2018 Winter Games and other cyber attacks, including the 2018 spear phishing\nattacks against the UK’s Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL (Defence\nScience and Technology Laboratory)).\n\nThe UK attributed the attacks against DSTL (Defence Science and Technology Laboratory),\nwhich followed the Salisbury poisonings, to Russia in 2018.\n\n## Background\n\nThese cyber attacks were committed by the GRU’s Main Centre for Special Technologies,\nGTsST also known by its field post number 74455 and known in open source as:\n\nSandworm\nBlackEnergy Group\nTelebots\nVoodooBear\nIron Viking\nQuedagh\nElectrum\nIndustroyer\nG0034\n\nThe UK government is today confirming for the first time that the GRU unit known as GTsST\nor by its field post number 74455 were responsible for:\n\n\n**GRU action**\n\n\n**UK**\n**government**\n**response**\n\n\n-----\n\n**UK**\n**government**\n**response**\n\nThe UK\ngovernment\nis publicly\nexposing\nthis attack\nas the work\nof the GRU\nfor the first\ntime today\n\n\n**Winter**\n**Olympics,**\n**February**\n**2018**\n\n\n**GRU action**\n\nGTsST actors launched a significant campaign against the\nWinter Olympic games, which included the use of Olympic\nDestroyer malware. This malware targeted the Winter Olympic\nand Paralympic Games. NCSC (National Cyber Security\nCentre) assess that the intent behind the incident was almost\ncertainly sabotage as the malware was designed to wipe data\nfrom and disable computers and networks. Disruption to the\nWinter Olympics could have been greater if it had not been for\nadministrators who worked to isolate the malware and replace\naffected computers. More broadly, the GTsST actors targeted\nmultiple entities across South Korea (and the world) which\nwere linked with the Winter Olympics. This activity utilised a\nrange of capabilities known to be used by the GTsST. This\nincludes targeting of: officials, sponsors, a ski resort, official\nservice providers, and broadcasters\n\n\nThe UK government has previously publicly exposed that this unit of the GRU was\nresponsible for:\n\n\n**UK government**\n**response**\n\nUK government publicly\nexposed this attack as\nthe work of the GRU in\nFebruary 2020\n\nUK government publicly\nexposed this attack as\nthe work of the GRU in\nFebruary 2020\n\nUK government publicly\nexposed this attack as\nthe work of the GRU in\nFebruary 2018. EU\nsanctioned the GRU unit\nfor this attack in July\n2020\n\nUK government publicly\nexposed this attack as\nthe work of the GRU in\nOctober 2018\n\n\n**BlackEnergy,**\n**December**\n**2015**\n\n**Industroyer,**\n**December**\n**2016**\n\n**NotPetya,**\n**June 2017**\n\n**BadRabbit,**\n**October**\n**2017**\n\n\n**GRU action**\n\nShut off part of Ukraine’s electricity grid, with\n230,000 people losing power for between 1 –\n6 hours\n\nShut off part of Ukraine’s electricity grid, also\nknown as CrashOverride. It resulted in a fifth\nof Kyiv losing power for an hour. It is the first\nknown malware designed specifically to\ndisrupt electricity grids\n\nDestructive cyber attack targeting the\nUkrainian financial, energy and government\nsectors and affecting other European and\nRussian businesses\n\nRansomware encrypted hard drives and\nrendered IT inoperable. This caused disruption\nincluding to the Kyiv metro, Odessa airport,\nRussia’s central bank and two Russian media\noutlets\n\n\n-----\n\n**UK government**\n**response**\n\nIn April 2018, the NCSC\n(National Cyber Security\nCentre), FBI and\nDepartment for\nHomeland Security\nissued a joint Technical\nAlert exposing that the\nGRU was responsible\n\nUK government publicly\nexposed this attack as\nthe work of the GRU in\nOctober 2018\n\nUK government publicly\nexposed this attack as\nthe work of the GRU in\nOctober 2018\n\nUK government publicly\nexposed this attack as\nthe work of the GRU in\nFebruary 2020\n\n\n**VPNfilter,**\n**October**\n**2017**\n\n**DSTL**\n**(Defence**\n**Science and**\n**Technology**\n**Laboratory),**\n**April 2018**\n\n**FCO, March**\n**2018**\n\n**Georgia, 28**\n**October**\n**2019**\n\n\n**GRU action**\n\nVPNFILTER malware infected thousands of\nhome and small business routers and network\ndevices worldwide. The infection potentially\nallowed attackers to control infected devices,\nrender them inoperable and intercept or block\nnetwork traffic\n\nThe GRU attempted to use its cyber\ncapabilities to gain access to the UK’s\nDefence and Science Technology Laboratory\n(DSTL (Defence Science and Technology\nLaboratory)) computer systems\n\nThe GRU attempted to compromise the UK\nForeign and Commonwealth Office (FCO)\ncomputer systems via a spearphishing attack\n\nThe GRU carried out large scale disruptive\ncyber-attacks against Georgian web hosting\nproviders that resulted in widespread\ndefacement of websites, including sites\nbelonging to the Georgian Government,\ncourts, NGOs, media and businesses, and\nalso interrupted the service of several national\nbroadcasters\n\n\nThe National Cyber Security Centre has assessed with high confidence that all of these\nattacks were almost certainly (95%+) carried out by the unit known as the Main Centre for\nSpecial Technologies (GTsST) also known as Unit 74455 of the GRU.\n\nSee further details on the framework used by the UK government for all source intelligence\nassessments, including the probability yardstick.\n\nMedia enquiries\n\n[Email newsdesk@fcdo.gov.uk](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:newsdesk@fcdo.gov.uk)\n\nTelephone 020 7008 3100\n\nContact the FCDO Communication Team via email (monitored 24 hours a day) in the first\ninstance, and we will respond as soon as possible.\n\n\n-----",
