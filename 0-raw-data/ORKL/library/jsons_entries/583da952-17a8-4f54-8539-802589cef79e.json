When a vulnerability is exploited, cloud\nservice providers are often reluctant to provide incident details except what is explicitly identified in the Service Level Agreement, making incident response\ndifficult at times.\n\n##### Sample of Threats to Cloud Services\n\n\n### OFFICE OF CYBER AND INFRASTRUCTURE ANALYSIS\n\nMarch 2017\n\n# RISKS TO CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE\n\n THAT USE CLOUD SERVICES\n\nCloud services offer a number of benefits such as scalability, high availability, and decreased ownership cost. As a result, owners and operators in several\ncritical infrastructure sectors such as Communications, Energy, Financial Services, Information Technology, and Transportation Services have migrated\nin-house computing resources to cloud infrastructures. However, cloud service environments still possess many of the same potential vulnerabilities associated\nwith internally hosted environments, as well as additional exploits to virtual systems or networks. Owners and operators of critical infrastructure need to fully\nunderstand the risk environment as they address current cloud services and consider additional migration.\n\n##### Industries leading the way in cloud adoption*\n\nFinancial Healthcare Retail High Tech Telecommunications Education Manufacturing\n\n## 55% 60% 71% 86% 78% 67% 59%\n\n*Percentage of information technology systems—by industry—that have adopted cloud services.\n\n##### Key Findings\n\nAlthough cloud services and physical information technology infrastructures are vulnerable to some common attack vectors, such as Denial of Service\nattacks, cloud services are also potentially vulnerable to a number of unique attack vectors such as Hyperjacking.
