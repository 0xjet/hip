It is possibly one of the most active and\npersistent Iran-based threat actors over the last decade and is known primarily for\nspoofing log-in pages of legitimate webmail services to collect credentials from its targets.\nThe threat actor also has a history of operational security (OPSEC) errors resulting in\ndisclosure of its tools, techniques and procedures (TTPs), including the addition of\nAndroid malware to its expanding toolset.\n\nOPSEC mistakes associated with Yellow Garuda operations in late 2021 resulted in the\ndiscovery of new tool used to enumerate data from targeted Telegram accounts. We also\nidentified an alias tied to early Iran-based operations and a surveillance report likely\nwritten by a Yellow Garuda operator. Additionally, PwC analysts have observed the threat\nactor’s use of macro-enabled template files as recently as March 2022, a new TTP not\npreviously associated with Yellow Garuda.\n\n## Telegram ‘grabber’ tool\n\nThrough our regular scanning for Yellow Garuda infrastructure, PwC analysts identified an\nopen directory located at 138.201.145[.]183 containing several compressed archives\nassociated with late 2021 Yellow Garuda activity.\n\nEach of the RAR archives contained a copy of a tool named\nNewTelegram.LocalGrabber.Sqlite.UI.Win.exe, together with the tool’s component parts,\nand exfiltrated victim data. In total there were seven sets of victim data on the server, six of\nwhich were outputs of the Telegram ‘grabber’ tool, and one of which was almost certainly\nthe result of data exfiltrated by mobile malware. Although it is unclear what malware was\nused, we note that the type of data captured is in line with the capabilities of\nPINEFLOWER, an Android malware previously attributed to Yellow Garuda . 1\n\nThese archives had filenames referencing Solar Hijri calendar dates indicating that the\nactivity took place between 7th September and 11th October 2021, when converted to the\nGregorian calendar. The activity suggests domestic targeting as all victim mobile numbers\ncontained the Iranian country code and Farsi was the main language seen in victim\n\n\n-----\n\ndatabases (as part of Telegram group names or in exfiltrated messages). From the data\nexfiltrated, it was also apparent that some of victims were associates of each other, where\ntwo pairs of victims were contacts of another victim on Telegram. We also observed that\ntwo of the victims likely had links to the Iranian music industry.\n\nFigure 1 - Contents of 138.201.145[.]183\n\nThe Telegram grabber tool is written in C++ and uses the open source Telegram Database\nLibrary (TDLib), a cross-platform Telegram client typically used to create custom apps for\nthe platform . It has been designed to exfiltrate information from a victim’s Telegram2\naccount. This includes messages and associated media, group memberships and contact\ndata.\n\n**SHA-256** 7709a06467b8a10ccfeed72072a0985e4e459206339adaea3afb0169bace024e\n\n**Filename** NewTelegram.LocalGrabber.Sqlite.UI.Win.exe\n\n**File type** Win32 EXE\n\n**File size** 5,423,104 bytes\n\n\n-----\n\n**Compilation**\n**timestamp**\n\n\n2062-01-30 02:30:48\n\n\nIn order to access the victim’s account, the threat actor needs to enter a login code which is\nissued by Telegram as part of its authentication process. The code is sent either to the\nvictim’s Telegram account, or via SMS to the victim’s phone . This means that the threat3\nactor needs to have access to a victim’s active Telegram session, either via a phone or\ndesktop, or otherwise be able to access their SMS messages, for example via mobile\nmalware. As can be seen in Figure 2, the victim’s phone number is required upon opening\nthe tool in order to send the authentication code.\n\nFigure 2 – GUI to enter victim’s phone number\n\nIf the victim has enabled two-step verification, an additional password is needed. Where\nthis is unknown, it can be reset using a recovery email if one has been previously setup.\nThe tool has options to view the password hint and send an access code via the victim’s\nrecovery email address, which the threat actor would need to access in order to proceed.\nThe existence of this option indicates that the threat actor, at least in some cases, is likely\nto have access to the victim’s email account. This aligns with Yellow Garuda’s known\ntactics, which include extensive credential harvesting via dedicated phishing sites.\n\nOnce authenticated, the operator is presented with multiple options to choose the type of\ndata to download. This includes the ability to select a date range for the download of the\ndifferent types of Telegram chat messages. For groups, the tool attempts to grab details on\nthe participants as well as whether or not the victim is an administrator. The tool is also\nable to download data relating to the victim’s profile and their contacts, including their\nnames, phone numbers, usernames and profile pictures.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3 – Metadata accessed for each contact\n\nThe exfiltrated data is stored within a SQLite database and also in JSON format. For\nattachments sent or received through chats, there are options to choose specific file\nformats to download. These pertain to common video, audio, document, binary and\ncompressed file extensions. In addition to being able to exfiltrate data, the threat actor also\nhas the ability to delete messages from the victim’s account.\n\nWe found 15 additional samples of the tool on an online multi-antivirus scanner which\nshare the same filename (NewTelegram.LocalGrabber.Sqlite.UI.Win.exe) and TypeLib ID\n(7bb2c20c-740e-498b-8dd6-9c2ff8ad9572) as the sample we analysed. The TypeLib ID is\na unique GUID created by Visual Studio when a new project is created, thus indicating4\nthat all of the samples originated from the same project. The additional samples were all\nuploaded within a 31 day window between January and February 2021 and contained\nsimilar functionality to the one we analysed. The main difference was the presence of a web\nrequest function that appeared to be used in a testing capacity. Given the clustered times of\nsubmission and the presence of the web request test method, we assess it is likely these\nsamples were submitted by the threat actor itself in a testing capacity.\n\n## Insights into Yellow Garuda’s operations\n\n\n-----\n\nThe following Microsoft Word document was found in the directory corresponding to one\nof the victims whose data was highly likely exfiltrated via mobile malware and not through\nthe Telegram ‘grabber’ tool. Its filename translates to ‘01Report’ and its contents detail the\nstatus of the surveillance on that victim.\n\n**Filename** 01گزارش.docx\n\n**SHA-256** 36c12ff1b62f4579d64926f5a26c4a1806235859a8f71c8754d5b257716be538\n\n**File type** DOCX\n\n**Author** ll_invisible_ll\n\n**Last** ll_invisible_ll\n**modified**\n**user**\n\n**Creation** 2021-10-11 06:48:00\n**date**\n\n**Last** 2021-10-12 12:54:00\n**modifed**\n**date**\n\n**File size** 13,736 bytes\n\nFigure 4 – Threat actor report (left) and translation from Farsi to English (right)\n\n|Filename|01شرازگ.docx|\n|---|---|\n|SHA-256|36c12ff1b62f4579d64926f5a26c4a1806235859a8f71c8754d5b257716be538|\n|File type|DOCX|\n|Author|ll_invisible_ll|\n|Last modified user|ll_invisible_ll|\n|Creation date|2021-10-11 06:48:00|\n|Last modifed date|2021-10-12 12:54:00|\n|File size|13,736 bytes|\n\n\n-----\n\nThe report gives us insight into the threat actor’s specific data collection objectives. It\nreferences the surveillance of audio and video conversations of the victim’s phone and\nconfirms the victim’s name, national identity number, mobile number and phone model. It\nindicates the surveillance was completed on 11 October 2021 and is being sent for reviewth\nby the ‘relevant expert’ on the orders of the manager of ‘2000’ and ‘2300’, numbers which\ncould represent individual operators or departments within Yellow Garuda’s operations.\nThe report ends with a warning that if the surveillance is detected, it will not be possible to\nre-access the phone.\n\nThese numbers align with additional observations from the output log files of the Telegram\n‘grabber’ tool which contained local file paths likely belonging to the threat actor. An\nexample is as follows:\n\nFigure 5 – Example of file path found in output log files. The date converts to 22nd\nSeptember 2021 in the Gregorian calendar\n\nWe observed values of 1500, 2700 and 3500 being used as part of the local directory\nstructure. This indicates that at least three operators or teams may have contributed to the\nTelegram ‘grabber’ activity observed and a further two separate operators or teams worked\non the victim referenced in the report.\n\nA previously leaked organisational chart associated with Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary\nGuard Corps (IRGC) shows individual departments with similar numerical referencing\n(Figure 6) . From the English translation in Table 1, we can see that several of the observed5\nvalues are present, overlapping with departments related to cyber, security and\ncounterintelligence. Although we are unable to independently verify the validity of this\nchart, the overlap in naming convention, and our understanding that Yellow Garuda is\nlikely associated with the IRGC, aligns with our assessment that these are operator/team6\nnames.\n\n\nThe author name of the threat actor report, “ll_invisible_ll” is fairly unique and gives us\ninsight into a potential individual operator. This alias was also in use between 2010 and\n2016 on the Ashiyane forum, a now defunct Iranian hacking forum originally started by the\nAshiyane Digital Security Team. The Ashiyane Digital Security Team has previously been\nlinked to IRGC activity and several of its members appeared in a US Department of7\nJustice (DOJ) indictment for distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks against\norganisations in the US financial sector and other US-based companies between 2011 and\n2013 .8\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6 – Diagram purportedly showing IRGC-related departments and leads (Farsi\nlanguage) [9]\n\n|Name|Number|\n|---|---|\n|Head of the Intelligence Unit of the IRGC, Hossein Taeb|20|\n|The Head of Department, General Yar Ali Sabzi|100|\n\n\n-----\n\n|Deputy of Readiness and Support|200|\n|---|---|\n|Deputy of HR and Recruitment|300|\n|Deputy of Plan, Program and Budget, General Gholipour|400|\n|Deputy of Military Intelligence|500|\n|Deputy of Psychological Operations, Haj Abdullah Mushfeq|600|\n|Special cases|700|\n|Deputy of Equipping, General Sadeghian|900|\n|Deputy of Information Protection, Izadi|1000|\n|Deputy of Inspector, General Karimi|1100|\n|Deputy of Information Collection|1200|\n|Thematic|1300|\n|Deputy of Counterintelligence, General Taha|1500|\n|Deputy of Arrest and Surveillance Operation, Detention Center, General Qajavand|1600|\n|Legal Deputy, Dr. Mahdavi|1700|\n|Deputy of Civil Engineering (Structure and Building)|1800|\n|Representative of the Supreme Leader, Haj Qasimi and Mr. Elahi|1900|\n|Deputy of Cyber, Hamid Naeem|2000|\n|Deputy of Security (Counter-Terrorism and Fight against Armed Groups), General Nouhi|2300|\n|Deputy of Crimes|2400|\n|Centre of Documents|N/A|\n\n\n**Table 1 – English translation of Figure 6 showing IRGC-related departments**\n**and leads; numbers overlapping with those observed in our analysis have**\n**been highlighted in bold**\n\n## Macro-enabled Word document templates\n\nBetween January and March 2022, we observed Yellow Garuda using Microsoft Word\ndocument droppers which use remote template injection to obtain and execute a malicious\nmacro. This is the first time we have observed the threat actor deploying macros or using\nremote template injection as part of its attack sequence.\n\n\n-----\n\n|SHA-256|Filename|\n|---|---|\n|41b37de3256a5d1577bbed4a04a61bd7bc119258266d2b8f10a9bb7ae7c0d4ec|Turkey_inj.docx10|\n|725bdf594baa21edf1f3820b0daf393267066717832452598c617552a004e5da|Turkey.docx|\n|01ca3f6dc5da4b98915dd8d6c19289dcb21b0691df1bb320650c3eb0db3f214c|Iran- Taliban relations.docx|\n|57cc5e44fd84d98942c45799f367db78adc36a5424b7f8d9319346f945f64a72|NY.docx|\n|a8c062846411d3fb8ceb0b2fe34389c4910a4887cd39552d30e6a03a02f4cc78|Details-of- Complaint.docx|\n\n\n**Table 2 – Details of Microsoft Word document droppers (DOCX)**\n\nThe document lures we observed covered a variety of themes including nuclear energy and\nweapons related to Turkey, US shipping ports and Iran’s relationship to the Taliban and as\nsuch, we assess they were likely used to target a variety of unrelated entities. Many of these\nlures, used material sourced from legitimate English-language websites, including news\nand media sites. It is not unusual for threat actors to make use of current affairs as a means\nto catch the attention of potential victims and the themes are not necessarily indicative of\nspecific targeting.\n\nFigure 7 – Example of lure content\n\n\n-----\n\nThe initial Microsoft Word document (DOCX) is hosted on a third party service such as\nDropbox or Amazon Web Services (AWS). Yellow Garuda is known to extensively employ\nsocial engineering as part of its attacks, therefore it is highly likely phishing was used to\ncoerce a potential victim to download and open the document.\n\nOnce opened, a form of remote template injection takes place where the document reaches\nout to a URL to download a file with a DOTM extension (a macro-enabled template file).\nThe URL is specified within the relationship component word/_rels/settings.xml.rels of\nthe initial document as indicated by the ‘Target’ value in Figure 8. The documents we\nanalysed reached out to files hosted on either Microsoft OneDrive or on dedicated threat\nactor-controlled infrastructure, as can be seen below.\n\nFigure 8 – URL visible in word/_rels/settings.xml.rels\n\nWe were able to access several examples of this second stage macro-enabled template file.\nThese differed in functionality and form, however they all maintained persistence by\nreplacing the victim’s default Microsoft Word template, meaning that the malicious\ntemplate (and macro) will open whenever Microsoft Word is opened by the victim.\n\n**SHA-256** **Filename**\n\nc45bffb5fe7056075b966608e6b6bf82102f722b5c5d8a9c55631e155819d995\n\ndd28806d63f628dbc670caaa67379da368e62fa9edfbdfd37d3a91354df08e1c\n\nc0d5043b57a96ec00debd3f24e09612bcbc38a7fb5255ff905411459e70a6bb4 Details.dotm\n\n28de2ccff30a4f198670b66b6f9a0ce5f5f9b7f889c2f5e6a4e365dea1c89d53 Arabic.dotm\n\n**Table 3 – Details of malicious template files (DOTM)**\n\nIn some cases, we observed the macro code creating a reverse shell using code almost11\nidentical to that found in open source on a GitHub repository . In other cases, the12 13\ntemplate files were password protected meaning that the victim is required to specify the\npassword in order for the attack sequence to proceed. This would need to be passed over to\nthe victim via a phishing email or some other form of social engineering. The template files\nalso contained RC4-encrypted strings (both within the macro and lure document) for\nwhich the decryption key needed to be obtained as the response to a HTTP GET request to\n\n|SHA-256|Filename|\n|---|---|\n|c45bffb5fe7056075b966608e6b6bf82102f722b5c5d8a9c55631e155819d995|DocTemplate.dotm|\n|dd28806d63f628dbc670caaa67379da368e62fa9edfbdfd37d3a91354df08e1c|DocTemplate.dotm|\n|c0d5043b57a96ec00debd3f24e09612bcbc38a7fb5255ff905411459e70a6bb4|Details.dotm|\n|28de2ccff30a4f198670b66b6f9a0ce5f5f9b7f889c2f5e6a4e365dea1c89d53|Arabic.dotm|\n\n\n-----\n\nan Amazon S3 bucket. These steps were likely designed to thwart analysis attempts if the\npassword cannot be obtained to open the document, or the infrastructure hosting the\ndecryption key is no longer active.\n\nFiles dropped by the macros shared similar filenames to recent Yellow Garuda activity\nobserved by Check Point . The PowerShell backdoor known as CharmPower was observed14\nto read data from a file called ni.txt, located in %AppData%, whose contents are sent to the\ncommand and control server along with basic information about the victim’s machine. This\naligns with our observations that ni.txt is used to house a hardcoded identifier and could\nindicate that a version of CharmPower is deployed at a later stage of the attack sequence.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOver the past year, we have seen Yellow Garuda continue to add tools to its arsenal. In its\nuse of macro-enabled template files, we can see that the threat actor has made efforts to\nstage various parts of the infection chain remotely, disrupting analysis efforts where these\nare not accessible. The threat actor has also continued to make OPSEC mistakes exposing\nits tools and targeting through open servers. The Telegram ‘grabber’ tool we observed\nappears to be a tool that the threat actor has had access to since at least January 2021, and\nused against domestic targets to obtain specific access to Telegram messages and contacts\nalongside mobile malware.\n\nThe threat actor’s operational report has given us further insight into its analysis process,\nindicating that there is an internal structure to its operations denoted by numerical call\nsigns. It also highlights the alias of an individual which has previously been linked to Iranbased activity over several years.\n\n### MITRE ATT&CK\n\nMore detailed information on each of the techniques used
