The\nphishing emails and document files leveraged a variety of geopolitically sensitive subject matters as attractive\nlures, such as events in Beijing, the Dalai Lama, North Korea relations, the Zika virus, and various legitimate\nappearing announcements. As we began to analyze and tear down the various samples we collected, we found\nsignificant overlaps with previously reported and documented adversary groups, attack campaigns, and their\n[toolsets, exemplifying the concept of the Digital Quartermaster.](https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/global/en/current-threats/pdfs/rpt-malware-supply-chain.pdf)\n\nThe concept of the Digital Quartermaster is not a particularly new one; it is the idea that there is a group, or\ngroups whose mission is to supply and maintain malicious tools in support of cyber espionage operations. The\nexistence of a Digital Quartermaster has been discussed within the intelligence community for some time, but it is\nnot often that sufficient overlaps exist between what appear to be separate toolsets to confidently claim this idea\nis indeed in use. The data Unit 42 has collected and analyzed however, does strongly point to the possibility that\nwhile there may be multiple operations groups, a Digital Quartermaster may be the one supplying and\nmaintaining the tools used.\n\n## Attack Analysis\n\n[While investigating new BBSRAT instances discovered using the AutoFocus tool, Unit 42 was able to collect](https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/2015/12/bbsrat-attacks-targeting-russian-organizations-linked-to-roaming-tiger/)\nadditional samples, weaponized documents, and phishing emails uploaded to VirusTotal between August 2015\nthrough February 2016. Each of the samples collected via WildFire and VirusTotal contained significant overlaps\nin tactics used, tools used, as well as infrastructure for command and control channels. In addition, a large\nmajority of the samples gathered from VirusTotal were uploaded from a single entity in Mongolia.\n\nThe attacks themselves followed a consistent playbook throughout the observed timeframe; using weaponized\nMicrosoft Word documents initially containing an exploit for only CVE-2012-0158, appearing to use the highly\npopular ‘Tran Duy Linh’ toolkit, then adding in an additional exploit for CVE-2014-1761 in the three newest\nsamples we collected. The newer documents containing exploits for both vulnerabilities appeared to use a\npublically available PoC authored by ‘HCL’, with little to no modifications made. All of the weaponized documents\nexcept two executed the Cmstar loader or a lightly modified variant of Cmstar onto the victim host while\ndisplaying a decoy document or a legitimate appearing document that is generated and presented to the user to\nmake it appear that the weaponized document that had been executed was indeed, legitimate. Once Cmstar was\nloaded onto the victim hosts, it would attempt to retrieve a final payload. Unfortunately, at the time of analysis, we\n\n\n-----\n\nwere unable to retrieve the majority of the payloads the Cmstar loaders were attempting to download, but those\nthat were available were variants of BBSRAT. The two samples not using Cmstar simply had BBSRAT embedded\ndirectly into to the weaponized document.\n\nFurthermore, examining the data from August indicates that this campaign had started earlier and the adversary\nmay have already achieved initial footholds, due to the use of what appears to be compromised legitimate email\naccounts from within the Mongolian government.\n\n## Attack Timeline\n\n Attack Details\n\n**SHA256** 5beb50d95c1e720143ca0004f5172cb8881d75f6c9f434ceaff59f34fa1fe378\n\n**Date** 8/12/2015\n\n**Filename** Ялалтын баярын ар дахь улс төр.doc (Victory in the back of the government)\n\n\n**Vulnerability**\n**Targeted**\n\n\nCVE-2012-0158\n\n\n**Tools Used** Cmstar\n\n**Description** Two spear-phishing emails originating from likely compromised account\n'altangadas@energy.gov.mn' targets multiple other Mongolian government officials.

Yet, prior to the findings in this report, none of the tools used in this\ncampaign had been observed being used in conjunction with each other. [In their 2013 report, Kaspersky](https://kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/vlpdfs/kaspersky-the-net-traveler-part1-final.pdf)\ntheorized that NetTraveler may have had connections to the Lurid/Enfal adversaries due to some similarities in\ncommand and control infrastructure and targeting of minority groups in China, but no strong evidence was\n[discovered since then. CMStar is a variant of Lurid discovered by us in May 2015, with similar targeting as](https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/2015/05/cmstar-downloader-lurid-and-enfals-new-cousin/)\n[previously observed as NetTraveler, but again, with no strong connections. BBSRAT is a relatively new Trojan we](https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/2015/12/bbsrat-attacks-targeting-russian-organizations-linked-to-roaming-tiger/)\nhad discovered and publicized in December 2015 and had attributed it to a campaign dubbed ‘Roaming Tiger’ by\nESET in 2014, which specifically appeared to target Russia and Russian speaking nation state. None of these\ntools have been publicly observed in use together, in a singular campaign, until now:\n\nThe initial dropper embedded in the weaponized document files were obfuscated using a subtraction cipher\npreviously used to obfuscate strings in the NetTraveler malware family.\nA BinDiff comparison of the newer Cmstar variant with a previously reported on NetTraveler sample shows\nan 80% code similarity\nThe first stage loader used in the attacks was Cmstar, or lightly modified variants. Cmstar is closely related\nto Lurid which is associated with the Enfal trojan\nThe final payload for the newest weaponized documents retrieved was BBSRAT, which was previously\nassociated with an attack campaign called \"Roaming Tiger\", targeting Russia and other Russian speaking\nnations speaking\n\nThe one commonality that does appear amongst these seemingly different tools used by different operators is\ntheir geolocational nexus: China. In 2011, TrendMicro strongly attributed Lurid/Enfal to operators based out of\nChina, although they stopped just short of claiming it. In Kaspersky’s 2013 report on NetTraveler, another strong\n\n\n-----\n\nattribution was made to a China based operator. ESET s Roaming Tiger reporting did not attribute the attack to\nany specific nation-state, but examining the command and control infrastructure and WHOIS data again\nsuggested a China-based operator.\n\nThese facts begin to lead us to the following possible conclusions: the previous attack campaigns associated with\ntheir specific tool were all actually conducted by one, large, all encompassing operations unit. The previous\nattack campaigns were conducted by separate, but related operations unit with access to a common Digital\nQuartermaster for tools, or some combination of either scenario.\n\n## Technical Analysis of Tools Used\n\nAll of the Microsoft Word documents leveraged in these attacks used the CVE-2012-0158 and CVE-2014-1761\nexploits. All of the exploit documents, in addition to targeting the same organizations and relying upon the same\nexploit techniques, ultimately dropped a version of the BBSRAT. A large number of the encountered samples\nused a new version of the Cmstar downloader to accomplish this, while some documents dropped and executed\nBBSRAT directly. Upon successful exploitation, the exploit documents would drop and execute a payload using\none of the following techniques:\n\n1. The exploit document drops and executes a file with a path of %TEMP%\\xpsfiltsvcs.tmp. This file contains\n\n[an original Cmstar downloader that was discussed in a previous blog post.](https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/2015/05/cmstar-downloader-lurid-and-enfals-new-cousin/)\n2. The 'MSOProtect.acl', 'offcln.log', and 'offcln.pip' files are dropped in the %APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Office\\\n\ndirectory. The MSOProtect.acl file contains a new variant of the Cmstar malware family. The offcln.pip is a\nDLL that is responsible for opening a legitimate Microsoft Word decoy document. The offcln.log file contains\na command that will open this decoy document. The offcln.log file is used by offcln.pip in order to\naccomplish this.\n3. The %APPDATA%\\comctl32.dll file is dropped and subsequently loaded. This file contains either a new\n\ninstance of the Cmstar downloader, or a copy of the BBSRAT malware family, which was discussed by Palo\nAlto Networks in December 2015.\n\n**New Cmstar Downloader**\n\nThe majority of the spear-phishing attachments leveraged variants of the previously discussed downloader\nnamed 'Cmstar'. Much of the functionality remained consistent in the newest variants, which were compiled in\nJuly and August of 2015. For reference, the original Cmstar downloader malware samples were compiled in\nFebruary 2015.\n\nThe new samples appear to have minimal changes made, and in fact a number of the debugging statements\nmentioned in the original samples are seen in a number of the newest variants. The obfuscated routine that is\nresponsible for downloading the payload has increased in size from 779 bytes to 943 bytes. This increase in size\nis due to additional error controls put into place. This routine is still encrypted using a single-byte XOR operation.\n\nHowever, the newest Cmstar variants use a different routine to obfuscate important strings within the binary. The\nfollowing code, represented in Python, accomplishes this:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n\n\ndef decode(data):\nout = \"\"\nc = 0\nfor d in data:\nout += chr(ord(d) - c - 10)\nc += 1\nreturn out\n\n\n-----\n\nMalware analysts may recognize this routine, as it s identical to the one witnessed in previously discussed\nNetTraveler samples that were found to be targeting an individual working for the Foreign Ministry of Uzbekistan\nin China. As witnessed in the following diagram, the new Cmstar downloader’s obfuscation routine has a 100%\ncode match to the NetTraveler downloader previously encountered:\n\nFigure 1 Code Overlap Between Cmstar and NetTraveler Downloaders\n\nThe following URLs were identified to be used by these Cmstar samples:\n\nhttp://thbaw.ofhloe[.]com/cgl-bin/conime.cgi\nhttp://dolimy.celeinkec[.]com/cgl-bin/upl.cgi\nhttp://question.eboregi[.]com\nhttp://pplime.savecarrots[.]com/cgl-bin/upsd.cgi\nhttp://dolimy.celeinkec[.]com/bin/r0206/update.tmp\n\nThe majority of these URLs were not responsive at the time of analysis, with the exception of the last one. This\nreturned file is an encoded executable that contains a dropper, which in turn loads BBSRAT.\n\n**BBSRAT**\n\nMuch of BBSRAT's functionality has remained consistent in the newest variants. Like previous versions, the\nmalware will build an Import Address Table at runtime and uses the following mutex to ensure a single copy of\nBBSRAT is running at a given time:\n\n_Global\\\\GlobalAcProtectMutex_\n\nAdditionally, the network structure, URL pattern, and other characteristics of the malware remain consistent.\nBBSRAT will ensure persistence by setting the following registry key:\n\n_HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\comctl32 - rundll32.exe %APPDATA%\\comctl32.dll,_\n_Enter_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe largest modification has been the addition of four commands to the command and control handler. These\ncommands are still being researched and full functionality of them has yet to be determined. We have identified\nthe following BBSRAT command and control servers:\n\ncocolco[.]com\nofhloe[.]com\nhousejjk[.]com\n\n## Infrastructure Analysis\n\nMapping out the first stage command and control infrastructure for the analyzed Cmstar samples revealed an\ninfrastructure that was most likely deployed specifically for this attack campaign:\n\nFigure 2 Cmstar Command and Control Infrastructure\n\nA single domain, question.erobegi[.]com, was found to be reused. This domain had previous been identified as a\n[first stage command and control in May 2015 when we initially discovered CMStar. However, the payload was not](https://blog.paloaltonetworks.com/2015/05/cmstar-downloader-lurid-and-enfals-new-cousin/)\nidentified at the time. The WHOIS data revealed heavy usage of resellers by the adversary, likely as an evasion\ntechnique. Analyzing the historical WHOIS data however, revealed one of the 'clean' personas used by the\n[adversary as a registrant 'HELENEHELEN@EXCITE.CO.JP', was used to register one of the command and](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:HELENEHELEN@EXCITE.CO.JP)\ncontrol domains for CMStar, celeinkec[.]com as well as one of the primary command and control domains for\nBBSRAT, housejjk[.]com, further supporting the links between CMStar, and BBSRAT.\n\nThe BBSRAT command and control infrastructure remained exactly the same as previously reported in\nDecember 2015:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3 BBSRAT Command and Control Infrastructure\n\nUnfortunately, we were unable to retrieve all of the final payloads from every sample at the time of analysis. One\ninteresting fact to note is the use of the primary domain ofhloe[.]com; BBSRAT uses pagbine.ofhloe[.]com as a\nprimary command and control, while we also observed Cmstar thbaw.ofhloe[.]com as a first stage command and\ncontrol to likely retrieve BBSRAT.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nUnit 42 often speaks of sharing threat intelligence, tools, and procedures amongst the security industry, often\ntimes pointing to the fact that the adversaries we are up against on an everyday basis are doing the exact same.\nStill, as a community, when we do publicize adversary groups or campaigns, there is a tendency to encapsulate\neach and place them in their own isolated bubbles, directly contradicting the message of sharing amongst the\nadversary. The reasoning behind this is not meant to be hypocritical – it is simply more straightforward for\nidentification and ingestion purposes to be able to silo each group or campaign rather than come to the\nconclusion that every group or campaign is somehow related due to the sharing nature of the adversaries. We\nmust acknowledge the fact however, that in general many attacks are related, even if they do appear significantly\ndifferent or do not share the same TTPs as observed previously\n\nThe collection of data we have analyzed strongly points to the fact that a Digital Quartermaster may exist\namongst the adversary. The strong overlaps within the tactics used in the toolsets as well as links in\ninfrastructure indicate it is likely that a singular entity is responsible for deployment and maintenance of the tools\nused, in conjunction with a separate operator group responsible for the actual execution of the cyber espionage\noperations.\n\nPalo Alto Networks customers are protected through our next-generation security platform:\n\nWildFire successfully detects BBSRAT, Cmstar, and the weaponized documents as malicious\n[AutoFocus identifies the tools used under the Cmstar and](https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.Cmstar) [BBSRAT tags](https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.BBSRAT)\nTraps actively detects and prevents exploitation of both CVE-2012-0158 and CVE-2014-1761\nThe C2 domains and files mentioned in this report are blocked through Threat Prevention\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n**Exploit Document SHA256 Hashes**\n\n\n-----\n\n5beb50d95c1e720143ca0004f5172cb8881d75f6c9f434ceaff59f34fa1fe378\n10090692ff40758a08bd66f806e0f2c831b4b9742bbf3d19c250e778de638f57\n44dbf05bc81d17542a656525772e0f0973b603704f213278036d8ffc999bb79a\n91ffe6fab7b33ff47b184b59356408951176c670cad3afcde79aa8464374acd3\n6f3d4fb64de9ae61776fd19a8eba3d1d828e7e26bb89ace00c7843a57c5f6e8a\ne88ea5eb642eaf832f8399d0337ba9eb1563862ddee68c26a74409a7384b9bb9\n68f97bf3d03b1733944c25ff4933e4e03d973ccdd73d9528f4d68806b826735e\n00ddae5bbc2ddf29954749519ecfb3978a68db6237ebea8e646a898c353053ce\nc2ebaf4366835e16f34cc7f0b56f8eaf80a9818375c98672bc678bb4107b4d8c\naa86f4587423c2ff677aebae604614030f9f4d38280409501662ab4e4fe20c2a\nfc21814a5f9ed2f6bef9e15b113d00f9291a6553c1e02cc0b4c185c6030eca45\n7e031a04e570cddda907d0b4b7af19ce60dc481394dfb3813796ce0e6d079305\n0b0e6b40a63710b4f7e6d00d7a4a86e6db2df720fef48640ab6d9d88352a4890\n5c7e3cde4d286909154e9a5ee5a5d061a1f0efaa9875fb50c9073e1e8b6cfaef\n\n**BBSRAT SHA256 Hashes**\n\n567a5b54d6c153cdd2ddd2b084f1f66fc87587dd691cd2ba8e30d689328a673f\n\ncd3b8e4f3a6379dc36fedf96041e292b4195d03f27221167bce7302678fb2540\n\n**BBSRAT C2 Servers**\n\njowwln.cocolco[.]com\n\npagbine.ofhloe[.]com\n\ncdaklle.housejjk[.]com\n\n**Cmstar SHA256 Hashes**\n\nc3253409cccee20caa7b77312eb89bdbe8920cdb44f3fabfe5e2eeb78023c1b8\n\n3e2c0d60c7677d3ead690b1b6d4d7c5aaa2d218679634ac305ef3d75b5688e6a\n\n3a7348d546d85a179f9d52ff83b20004136ee584993c23a8bfe5c168c00fbaa9\n\n19ba40a7fa332b750c7d93385dd51bd08ee63f91cedb4ae5a93f9f33ecb38c44\n\n4e1d59042336c3758e77c5c521f60ae262aad01bf7265581de54e869a02b65bc\n\n**Cmstar C2 Servers**\n\nhttp://thbaw.ofhloe[.]com/cgl-bin/conime.cgi\n\nhttp://dolimy.celeinkec[.]com/cgl-bin/upl.cgi\n\nhttp://question.eboregi[.]com\n\nhttp://pplime.savecarrots[.]com/cgl-bin/upsd.cgi\n\nhttp://dolimy.celeinkec[.]com/bin/r0206/update.tmp\n\n**Get updates from**\n\n**Palo Alto**\n\n**Networks!**\n\nSign up to receive the latest news, cyber threat intelligence and research from us\n\n[By submitting this form, you agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge our Privacy Statement.](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/legal-notices/terms-of-use)\n\n\n-----",
