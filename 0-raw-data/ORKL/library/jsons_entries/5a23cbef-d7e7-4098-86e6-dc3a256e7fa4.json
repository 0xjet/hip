The company has\na contract for the development of a “passive and active interception system” for the Italian\nState Police, but it’s unclear if the apps were used by law enforcement authorities.\n\nNow, newspapers in Italy have revealed that prosecutors in Naples opened an inquiry into\neSurv and its activities well before last week’s report. Two sources close to the company\nconfirmed the investigation to Motherboard.\n\n**_Got a tip?

Among them are Giuseppe Fasano, the head of eSurv, and\nSalvatore Ansani, another member of the company’s management.\n\nA spokesperson for eSurv did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Naples prosecutor's office said in a press release Monday that it is investigating both\neSurv and STM, another company that worked with the surveillance company. As part of the\ninvestigation, the press release read, the prosecutors shut down eSurv’s infrastructure, which\nwas used to operate the spyware, code-named Exodus.\n\n**_[Listen to CYBER, Motherboard’s new weekly podcast about hacking and](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/cyber/id1441708044?mt=2)_**\n**_cybersecurity._**\n\n## ORIGINAL REPORTING ON EVERYTHING THAT MATTERS IN YOUR INBOX.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to the [Terms of Use and](https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/privacy-policy/en_us/page/terms-of-use.html) [Privacy Policy & to receive electronic](https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/privacy-policy/en_us/page/privacy-policy.html)\ncommunications from Vice Media Group, which may include marketing promotions,\nadvertisements and sponsored content.\n\n\n-----",
