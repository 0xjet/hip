Their attack chain remains consistent, with the continued use of archive files, shortcut files, malicious loaders, and the use of_\n_PlugX malware. The goal of this particular operation appears to be collecting sensitive information from European countries and states_\n_[from Asia, which might be supporting Western countries. Learn more.](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2022/12/mustang-panda-uses-the-russian-ukrainian-war-to-attack-europe-and-asia-pacific-targets)_\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nThe BlackBerry Research & Intelligence Team recently uncovered a campaign by an advanced persistent threat (APT) group called\nMustang Panda that is leveraging the PlugX malware family to target the Southeast Asian state of Myanmar.\n\nOur team analyzed the samples in question and found their embedded configurations revealed a set of command-and-control (C2)\ndomains that masquerade as Myanmar news outlets. This is not the first time a campaign targeting this state has impersonated Myanmar\nnews outlets or used PlugX malware.\n\n[These tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), along with other corroborating evidence – such as a previous indication that the group](https://twitter.com/AvastThreatLabs/status/1404864965584977922)\n[was active in this location – lead us to assert with reasonable confidence that the China-based threat group known as Mustang Panda is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_confidence)\nresponsible for this campaign\n\n## Mustang Panda: an Origin Story\n\nMustang Panda (aka HoneyMyte, Bronze President or Red Delta) is a prolific APT group that has been publicly attributed as being based in\n[China. This group conducted malware campaigns as far back as 2012, which primarily related to cyber-espionage.](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2022/05/mustang-panda-targets-europe.html)\n\nTheir targets have included Government and Non-Government Organizations (NGO) in many locations around the world, from various\nstates in Southeast Asia to the European Union to the U.S. and beyond.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1 – Partial map of countries previously targeted by Mustang Panda_\n\n### Mustang Panda Attack Vector\n\nMustang Panda typically sends phishing emails with malicious document attachments as an initial infection vector. These documents are\nusually designed to mimic those of the targeted country or organization, or even current world affairs applicable to that region.\n\n[Once threat actors gain a foothold within a target organization, they typically deploy one of a variety of payloads such as Cobalt Strike,](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2021/11/all-your-beacon-are-belong-to-us-new-blackberry-book-cracks-code-of-cobalt-strike-threat-actors)\n[Poison Ivy, or PlugX, the latter of which is used most extensively.](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2016/06/cylanceprotect-vs-plugx)\n\n### Initial Thread\n\nIn late May of this year, BlackBerry detected some unusual network traffic to a domain – www[.]myanmarnewsonline[.]org. At first glance,\nthis URL appeared to be a Myanmar news website.\n\nThe files found to be communicating with this site were encompassed in several .RAR files. These files had a relatively low detection ratio\non VirusTotal (VT), and as shown in Figure 2, they followed a naming convention designed to make them appear to be legitimate utilities\nrelating to Hewlett-Packard (HP) printers.\n\n_Figure 2 – Communicating RAR files_\n\nThe RAR archives contained a legitimate signed utility from HP, along with a DLL loader and a DAT file that is an encrypted PlugX\npayload.\n\nOne of the legitimate utilities (“HPCustParticUI.exe” – SHA256\n8857232077b4b0f0e4a2c3bb5717fd65079209784f41694f8e1b469e34754cf6) was previously used in a similar fashion as part of a PlugX\n[execution chain, which was documented by another vendor in September 2021.](https://www.trellix.com/en-us/about/newsroom/stories/threat-labs/operation-harvest-a-deep-dive-into-a-long-term-campaign.html)\n\n\n-----\n\nIn early June of this year, a tweet from the user @kienbigmummy (shown in Figure 3) mentioned an additional .RAR file titled “service\nLog.rar” that was linked with a sub-domain of the previously mentioned website – images[.]myanmarnewsonline[.]org – that was\nassociated with PlugX and the Mustang Panda APT group.\n\n_Figure 3 – June 2nd PlugX tweet by @kienbigmummy_\n\nWe examined the network infrastructure (shown in Figure 4) linked to each of these three RAR files, which provided evidence of additional\nsamples that conform to the same or similar TTPs going back as far as late 2020, along with other sample types such as Cobalt Strike\nbeacon.\n\n_Figure 4 – VirusTotal graph of network infrastructure_\n\n\n-----\n\n### What is PlugX?\n\n[PlugX is a remote access tool (RAT) used by several threat groups. It is the malware of choice for the Chinese APT group Mustang Panda.](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0013/)\nThis group delivers the PlugX implant in the form of an encrypted data blob, which is typically paired with a DLL loader as well as a benign\napplication.\n\n[This actor has commonly employed the stealthy technique of side-loading the malicious DLLs into legitimate applications during](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2022/05/mustang-panda-targets-europe.html)\nexecution. This action then deploys the PlugX implant into memory.\n\nWe noted threat actors had used three separate legitimate applications within our RAR files; A free VPN service, and two legitimate HP\napplications related to HP’s Digital Imaging. Each legitimate application was bundled with a DLL and a data file. In two out of the three\nRAR files, the DAT file masqueraded as a different file format, such as JSON or CHM.\n\nUpon execution of the legitimate application, the threat loads a malicious DLL loader in a specific set order, which the threat actor has\nstrategically placed in the same folder to replace a legitimate one. This proceeds to side-load the DLL by abusing the DLL search order,\n[which is a technique also known as DLL Search Order Hijacking. The malicious DLL is then loaded into the legitimate application, where it](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/001/)\ndecrypts, loads and deploys the malicious PlugX implant. This execution chain is shown in Figure 5.\n\n_Figure 5 – PlugX side-loading execution chain_\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\nThe DLL loader is heavily obfuscated and employs dynamic API resolution upon runtime. It retrieves a handle to the encrypted PlugX\nimplant, then reads the data into a newly allocated region within memory. Execution is then passed to the implant, where the shellcode is\nexecuted, and it XOR decrypts the embedded payload, as shown in Figure 6. Once decryption is complete, RtlDecompressBuffer is\ncalled to decompress the decrypted payload to its final form as shown in Figure 7.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6 – Decryption routine_\n\n_Figure 7 – Decrypted payload header_\n\n## Conclusion\n\nMustang Panda, which is publicly known as a Chinese-affiliated APT group, has an established history of using the PlugX malware and\ntargeting nations throughout South-East Asia. This threat actor has been previously linked to campaigns targeting Myanmar government\n[entities using custom lures and compromising the website of the office of Myanmar’s president.](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2022/05/mustang-panda-targets-europe.html)\n\nThe TTPs associated with the campaign covered in this report align with those of Mustang Panda. We observed a typical attack chain\nemployed by the group, where attackers used a benign executable to side-load a malicious DLL loader, which then decrypts and loads the\nPlugX implant. We have also confirmed the C2 infrastructure associated with this campaign has been used to target entities in Myanmar,\n\n\n-----\n\nincluding a government VPN portal, from early March onwards.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)\n\n### File\n\n**SHA256**\n\n843709a59f12ff7aa06a5837be7a1a93fdf6f02f99936af6658c166e8abcaa2d\n\n0f3ec2a01ae57c7dd2bb8f130f0f2d1c20fcb397e5b8bbff491517b6d179919e\n\n558cbbcb969fe2fa3f1c74c376e307efcdbe3bad7497095619927edd5762363a\n\n### Network\n\n|SHA256|Name|Description|\n|---|---|---|\n|843709a59f12ff7aa06a5837be7a1a93fdf6f02f99936af6658c166e8abcaa2d|Service Log.rar|RAR file encompassing a legit signed utility + a DLL loader + a DAT PlugX payload|\n|0f3ec2a01ae57c7dd2bb8f130f0f2d1c20fcb397e5b8bbff491517b6d179919e|HP.rar|RAR file encompassing a legit signed utility + a DLL loader + a DAT PlugX payload|\n|558cbbcb969fe2fa3f1c74c376e307efcdbe3bad7497095619927edd5762363a|HP ColorLaserJet.rar|RAR file encompassing a legit signed utility + a DLL loader + a DAT PlugX payload|\n\n|Indicator|Type|Description|\n|---|---|---|\n|Update[.]hilifimyanmar[.]com|Domain|C&C|\n|Download[.]hilifimyanmar[.]com|Domain|C&C|\n|Images[.]myanmarnewsonline[.]org|Domain|C&C|\n|www[.]myanmarnewsonline[.]org|Domain|C&C|\n|154[.]204[.]26[.]120|IP|C&C|\n|45[.]134[.]83[.]4|IP|C&C|\n\n\n-----\n\n## Defense\n\n### Yara Rule for Mustang Panda\n\nrule targeted_MustangPanda_dll {\nmeta:\ndescription = \"Rule to detect malicious DLL originally used to target Myanmar\"\nauthor = \"The BlackBerry Research & Intelligence team\"\nversion = \"1.0\"\nlast_modified = \"2022-08-02\"\nhash = \"74fe609eb8f344405b41708a3bb3c39b9c1e12ff93232d4b7efe648d66ea7380\"\nhash = \"a0d7e541d5c579d2e0493794879fee58d8603b4f3fb146df227efa34c23d830e\"\nhash = \"efade7cf8f2caeb5a5d1cf647796975b0b153feac67217fccbdd203e473a4928\"\nlicense = \"This Yara rule is provided under the Apache License 2.0 (https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) and open to any user\nor organization, as long as you use it under this license and ensure originator credit in any derivative to The BlackBerry Research & Intelligence\nTeam\"\nstrings:\n$code1 = {88E280F20088DD20D588C680F6FF80E60020D008E908C630F188D834FF88CA30C220CA88D834FF88F920C180F7FF20FB08\nD988C834FF88D530C520D588D034FF88CE20C680F1FF20CA08D688E834FF88F180F1FF80F4}\n$code2 =\n{EA08D188DA80F2FF88CD30D520CD34FF88F980F1FF88E280F20008C880CA0034FF20D088E920C130C508E988D834FF88FA20C288F834F\nF88DD20C508EA88D820}\ncondition:\nuint16(0) == 0x5A4D and\nfilesize < 10MB and\nany of them\n}\n\n### MITRE ATT&CK \n\n[T1583.001 Acquire Infrastructure: Domains](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583/001/)\n\n[T1027 Obfuscated Files or Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/)\n\n[T1036.005 Masquerading: Match Legitimate Name or Location](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/005/)\n\n[T1574.002 Hijack Execution Flow: DLL Side-Loading](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/002/)\n\n### D3FEND\n\nD3-FA (File Analysis)\n\nD3-LFP (Local File Permissions)\n\nD3-DA (Dynamic Analysis)\n\nD3-EFA (Emulated File Analysis)\n\nD3-EAL (Executable Allowlisting)\n\nD3-SCA (System Call Analysis)\n\n**Further Reading:**\n\n\n-----\n\n## About The BlackBerry Research & Intelligence Team\n\nThe BlackBerry Research & Intelligence team examines emerging and persistent threats, providing intelligence analysis for the benefit of\ndefenders and the organizations they serve.\n\n[Back](javascript:history.back())\n\n\n-----",
