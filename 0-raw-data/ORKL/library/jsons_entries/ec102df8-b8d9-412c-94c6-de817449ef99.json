This research reveals that a cryptomining malware campaign we reported in `2018,`\n[Glupteba malware,](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/disrupting-glupteba-operation/) [significant DDoS attacks targeting several companies in Russia,](https://blog.qrator.net/en/meris-botnet-climbing-to-the-record_142/)\nincluding Yandex, as well as in New Zealand, and the United States, and presumably also\nthe TrickBot malware were all distributed by the same C2 server. I strongly believe the C2\nserver serves as a botnet-as-a-service controlling nearly `230,000 vulnerable MikroTik`\nrouters, and may be the `Meris botnet` [QRator Labs described in their blog post, which](https://blog.qrator.net/en/meris-botnet-climbing-to-the-record_142/)\nhelped carry out the aforementioned `DDoS attacks. Default credentials, several`\n[vulnerabilities, but most importantly the CVE-2018-14847 vulnerability, which was publicized](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2018-1487)\nin 2018, and for which `MikroTik issued a fix for, allowed the cybercriminals behind this`\nbotnet to enslave all of these routers, and to presumably rent them out as a service.\n\n## The evening of July 8, 2021\n\nAs a fan of MikroTik routers, I keep a close eye on what’s going on with these routers. I\nhave been tracking MikroTik routers for years, reporting a crypto mining campaign abusing\nthe routers as far back as `2018 . The mayhem around MikroTik routers began in` `2018`\n[mainly thanks to vulnerability CVE-2018-14847, which allowed cybercriminals to very easily](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2018-1487)\nbypass authentication on the routers. Sadly, many MikroTik routers were left unpatched,\nleaving their default credentials exposed on the internet.\n\nNaturally, an email from our partners, sent on `July 8, 2021, regarding a` `TrickBot`\ncampaign landed in my inbox. They informed us that they found a couple of new `C2`\nservers that seemed to be hosted on `IoT devices, specifically` `MikroTik routers,`\nsending us the `IPs . This immediately caught my attention.`\n\n\n-----\n\nMikroTik routers are pretty robust but run on a `proprietary OS, so it seemed unlikely`\nthat the routers were hosting the C2 binary directly. The only logical conclusion I could\ncome to was that the servers were using enslaved MikroTik devices to proxy traffic to the\nnext tier of C2 servers to hide them from malware hunters.\n\nI instantly had deja-vu, and thought “They are misusing that vulnerability aga…”.\n\n## Opening Pandora’s box full of dark magic and evil\n\nKnowing all this, I decided to experiment by deploying a `honeypot, more precisely a`\nvulnerable version of a MikroTik cloud router exposed to the internet. I captured all the\ntraffic and logged everything from the virtual device. Initially, I thought, let’s give it a week to\nsee what’s going on in the wild.\n\nIn the past, we were only dealing with already compromised devices seeing the state they\nhad been left in, after the fact. I was hoping to observe the initial compromise as it\nhappened in real-time.\n\nExactly `15 minutes` after deploying the honeypot, and it’s important to note that I\nintentionally changed the `admin username and` `password to a really strong combination`\n[before activating it, I saw someone logging in to the router using the infamous CVE](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2018-1487)\ndescribed above (which was later confirmed by `PCAP analysis).`\n\nWe’ve often seen fetch scripts from various domains hidden behind Cloudflare proxies used\nagainst compromised routers.\n\nBut either by mistake, or maybe intentionally, the first fetch that happened after the attacker\ngot inside went to:\n\n`bestony.club` at that time was not hidden behind `Cloudflare and resolved directly to`\nan IP address ( 116.202.93.14 ), a VPS hosted by `Hetzner in Germany. This first fetch`\nserved a script that tried to fetch additional scripts from the other domains.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhat is the intention of this script you ask? Well, as you can see, it tries to overwrite and\nrename all existing scheduled scripts named `U3, U4..U7 and set scheduled tasks to`\nrepeatedly import script fetched from the particular address, replacing the first stage\n“ bestony.info ” with “ globalmoby.xyz ”. In this case, the domain is already hidden\nbehind `CloudFlare to minimize likeness to reveal the real IP address if the C2 server is`\nspotted.\n\nThe second stage of the script, pulled from the C2, is more concrete and meaningful:\n\nIt hardens the router by closing all management interfaces leaving only SSH, and WinBox\n(the initial attack vector) open and enables the `SOCKS4 proxy server on port` `5678 .`\n\nInterestingly, all of the `URLs had the same format:`\n\n```\nhttp://[domainname]/poll/[GUID]\n\n```\n\nThe logical assumption for this would be that the same system is serving them, if\n\n`bestony.club` points to a real IP, while `globalmoby.xyz is hidden behind a proxy,`\n```\nCloudflare probably hides the same IP. So, I did a quick test by issuing: \n\n```\n\n-----\n\nAnd it worked! Notice two things here; it s necessary to put a `--user-agent header to`\nimitate the router; otherwise, it won’t work. I found out that the `GUID doesn’t matter when`\nissuing the request for the first time, the router is probably registered in the database, so\nanything that fits the `GUID format will work. The second observation was that every` `GUID`\nworks only once or has some rate limitation. Testing the endpoint, I also found that there is\na bug or a “silent error” when the end of the URL doesn’t conform to the `GUID, for`\nexample:\n\nIt works too, and it works consistently, not just once. It seems when inserting the URL into\nthe database, an error/exception is thrown, but because it is silently ignored, nothing is\nwritten into the database, but still the script is returned (which is quite interesting, that would\nmean the scripts are not exactly tied to the ID of the victim).\n\n## Listing used domains\n\nThe bestony.club is the first stage, and it gets us the second stage script and Cloudflare\nhidden domain. You can see the `GUID is reused throughout the stages. Provided all that`\nwe’ve learned, I tried to query the\n\nIt worked several times, and as a bonus, it was returning different domains now and then.\nSo by creating a simple script, we “ generated ” a list of domains being actively used.\n\ndomain IP ISP\n\nbestony.club 116.202.93.14 Hetzner, DE\n\nmassgames.space multiple Cloudflare\n\nwidechanges.best multiple Cloudflare\n\nweirdgames.info multiple Cloudflare\n\nglobalmoby.xyz multiple Cloudflare\n\nspecialword.xyz multiple Cloudflare\n\nportgame.website multiple Cloudflare\n\nstrtz.site multiple Cloudflare\n\n## The evil spreads its wings\n\n\n-----\n\nHaving all these domains, I decided to pursue the next step to check whether all the hidden\ndomains behind Cloudflare are actually hosted on the same server. I was closer to thinking\nthat the central C&C server was hosted there too. Using the same trick, querying the IP\ndirectly with the `host header, led to the already expected conclusion:`\n\nYes, all the domains worked against the `IP, moreover, if you try to query a` `GUID,`\nparticularly using the `host headers trick:`\n\nIt won’t work again using the full URL and vice versa.\n\nWhich returns an error as the GUID has been already registered by the first query, proving\nthat we are accessing the same server and data.\n\nObviously, we found more than we asked for, but that was not the end.\n\n## A short history of CVE-2018-14847\n\nIt all probably started back in `2018, more precisely on` `April 23, when Latvian`\nhardware company `MikroTik publicly announced that they fixed and released an update`\nfor their very famous and widely used routers, patching the `CVE-2018-14847 vulnerability.`\nThis vulnerability allowed anyone to literally download the user database and easily decode\npasswords from the device remotely by just using a few packets through the exposed\nadministrative protocol `TCP port` `8291 . The bar was low enough for anyone to exploit it,`\nand no force could have pushed users to update the firmware. So the outcome was as\nexpected: Cybercriminals had started to exploit it.\n\n## The root cause\n\nTons of articles and analysis of this vulnerability have been published. The original\nexplanation behind it was focused more on how the `WinBox protocol works and that you`\ncan ask a file from the router if it’s not considered as sensitive in `pre-auth state of`\ncommunication. Unfortunately, in the reading code path there is also a `path traversal`\n```\nvulnerability that allows an attacker to access any file, even if it is considered as\n\n```\n[sensitive. The great and detailed explanation is in this post from Tenable. The researchers](https://www.tenable.com/security/research/tra-2019-16#:~:text=Tenable%20discovered%20a%20vulnerability%20while,path%2C%20%2Frw%2Fdisk)\nalso found that this path traversal vulnerability is shared among other “API functions”\nhandlers, so it’s also possible to write an arbitrary file to the router using the same trick,\nwhich greatly enlarges the attack surface.\n\n## Messy situation\n\n\n-----\n\nSince then, we ve been seeing plenty of different strains misusing the vulnerability. The first\nnoticeable one was `crypto mining malware cleverly setting up the router using standard`\nfunctions and built-in proxy to inject crypto mining JavaScript into every `HTTP request`\nbeing made by users behind the router, amplifying the financial gain greatly. More in our\n[Avast blog post from](https://blog.avast.com/mikrotik-routers-targeted-by-cryptomining-campaign-avast) `2018 .`\n\nSince then, the vulnerable routers resembled a war field, where various attackers were\nfighting for the device, overwriting each other’s scripts with their own. One such noticeable\nstrain was Glupteba misusing the router and installing scheduled scripts that repeatedly\nreached out for commands from C2 servers to establish a `SOCKS proxy on the device that`\nallowed it to anonymize other malicious traffic.\n\nNow, we see another active campaign is being hosted on the same servers, so is there any\nremote possibility that these campaigns are somehow connected?\n\n## Closing the loop\n\nAs mentioned before, all the leads led to this one particular IP address (which doesn’t work\nanymore)\n\n```\n116.202.93.14\n\n```\n\nIt was more than evident that this IP is a C2 server used for an ongoing campaign, so let’s\nfind out more about it, to see if we can find any ties or indication that it is connected to the\nother campaigns.\n\nIt turned out that this particular IP has been already seen and resolved to various domains.\nUsing the RISKIQ service, we also found one eminent domain `tik.anyget.ru . When`\nfollowing the leads and when digging deeper and trying to find malicious samples that\naccess the particular host, we bumped into this interesting sample:\n\n```\na0b07c09e5785098e6b660f93097f931a60b710e1cf16ac554f10476084bffcb\n\n```\n\nThe sample was accessing the following URL, directly\n```\nhttp://tik.anyget.ru/api/manager from there it downloaded a JSON file with a list of\n\n```\nIP addresses. This sample is `ARM32 SOCKS proxy server binary written in` `Go and linked`\nto the `Glupteba malware campaign. The first recorded submission in VirusTotal was from`\n```\nNovember 2020, which fits with the Glupteba outbreak.\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nIt seems that the Glupteba malware campaign used the same server.\n\nWhen requesting the URL `http://tik.anyget.ru` I was redirected to the\n```\nhttp://routers.rip/site/login domain (which is again hidden by the Cloudflare\n\n```\nproxy) however, what we got will blow your mind:\n\nC2\n\ncontrol panel\n\n\n-----\n\nThis is a control panel for the orchestration of enslaved MikroTik routers. As you can see,\nthe number at the top displays the actual number of devices, close to `230K of devices,`\nconnected into the botnet. To be sure, we are still looking at the same host we tried:\n\nAnd it worked. Encouraged by this, I also tried several other IoCs from previous campaigns:\n\nFrom the crypto mining campaign back in 2018:\n\nTo the Glupteba sample:\n\nAll of them worked. Either all of these campaigns are one, or we are witnessing a botnet-asa-service. From what I’ve seen, I think the second is more likely. When browsing through\nthe control panel, I found one section that had not been password protected, a presets page\nin the control panel:\n\nConfiguration presets on C2 server\nThe oddity here is that the page automatically switches into Russian even though the rest\nstays in English (intention, mistake?). What we see here are configuration templates for\nMikroTik devices. One in particular tied the loop of connecting the pieces together even\nmore tightly. The VPN configuration template\n\n\n-----\n\nVPN preset that confirms that what we see on routers came from here\nThis confirms our suspicion, because these exact configurations can be found on all of our\nhoneypots and affected routers:\n\nHaving all these indications and IoCs collected, I knew I was dealing with a trove of secrets\nand historical data since the beginning of the outbreak of the `MikroTik campaign. I also`\nran an IPV4 thorough scan for socks port `5678, which was a strong indicator of the`\ncampaign at that time, and I came up with almost `400K devices with this port opened. The`\nsocks port was opened on my honeypot, and as soon as it got infected, all the available\nbandwidth of 1Mbps was depleted in an instant. At that point, I thought this could be the\nenormous power needed for DDoS attacks, and then two days later…\n\n## Mēris\n\nOn `September 7, 2021,` `QRator Labs published a blog post about a new botnet called`\nMēris. Mēris is a botnet of considerable scale misusing MikroTik devices to carry out one of\nthe most significant `DDoS attacks against` `Yandex, the biggest search engine in`\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nRussia, as well as attacks against companies in Russia, New Zealand, and the\nUnited States . It had all the features I’ve described in my investigation.\n\n```\nThe day after the publication appeared, the C2 server stopped serving scripts, and the next\nday, it disappeared completely. I don’t know if it was a part of a legal enforcement action or\njust pure coincidence that the attackers decided to bail out on the operation in light of the\npublic attention on Mēris. The same day my honeypots restored the configuration by closing\nthe `SOCKS proxies.`\n\n## TrickBot\n\nAs the IP addresses mentioned at the very beginning of this post sparked our wild\ninvestigation, we owe `TrickBot a section in this post. The question, which likely comes to`\nmind now is: “Is TrickBot yet another campaign using the same botnet-as-a-service?”. We\ncan’t tell for sure. However, what we can share is what we found on devices. The way\nTrickBot proxies the traffic using the NAT functionality in MikroTik usually looks like this:\n\ntypical rule found on TrickBot routers to relay traffic from victim to the hidden C2 server, the\nports might vary greatly on the side of hidden C2, on Mikrotik side, these are usually\n443,447 and 80, see IoC section\nPart of IoC fingerprint is that usually, the same rule is there multiple times, as the infection\nscript doesn’t check if it is already there:\n\nexample of the infected router, please note that rules are repeated as a result of the\ninfection script not checking prior existence. You can also see the masquerade rules used\nto allow the hidden C2 to access the internet through the router\nAlthough in the case of TrickBot we are not entirely sure if this could be taken as proof, I\nfound some shared IoCs, such as\n\n\n-----\n\nOutgoing PPTP/L2TP VPN tunnel on domains\n```\n   /interface l2tp-client add connect-to=\n   <sxx.eeongous.com|sxx.leappoach.info> disabled=no name=lvpn password=\n   <passXXXXXXX> profile=default user=<userXXXXXXX>\n\n```\nScheduled scripts / SOCKS proxies enabled as in previous case\nCommon password being set on most of the TrickBot MikroTik C2 proxies\n\nIt’s, however, not clear if this is a pure coincidence and a result of the router being infected\nmore than once, or if the same C2 was used. From the collected NAT translation, I’ve been\nable to identify a few IP addresses of the next tier of TrickBot C2 servers (see `IoCs`\nsection).\n\n## Not only MikroTik used by TrickBot\n\nWhen investigating the `TrickBot case I saw (especially after the Mēris case was`\npublished) a slight shift over time towards other IoT devices, other than MikroTik. Using the\nSSH port fingerprinting I came across several devices with an SSL certificate leading to\n[LigoWave devices. Again, the modus operandi seems to be the same, the initial vector of](https://www.ligowave.com/)\ninfection seems to be default credentials, then using capabilities of the device to proxy the\ntraffic from the `public IP address to` `TrickBot “hidden” C2 IP address.`\n\nTypical login screen on\n\nLigoWave AP products\nTo find the default password it took 0.35 sec on Google 😉\n\n\n-----\n\nGoogle search result\nThe same password can be used to login into the device using `SSH as admin with full`\nprivileges and then it’s a matter of using `iptables to set up the same NAT translation as`\nwe saw in the MikroTik case\n\nLigoWave AP shell using default credentials\n\n## They know the devices\n\nDuring my research, what struck me was how the criminals paid attention to details and\nsubtle nuances. For example, we found one configuration on this device:\n\n\n-----\n\nKnowing this device type, the attacker has disabled a physical display that loops through\nthe stats of all the interfaces, purposefully to hide the fact that there is a malicious VPN\nrunning.\n\n## Remediation\n\nThe main and most important step to take is to update your router to the latest version and\nremove the administrative interface from the public-facing interface, you can follow our\n[recommendation from our 2018 blog post which is still valid. In regards to TrickBot](https://blog.avast.com/mikrotik-routers-targeted-by-cryptomining-campaign-avast)\ncampaign, there are few more things you can do:\n\ncheck all `dst-nat mappings in your router, from` `SSH or` `TELNET terminal you can`\nsimply type:\n```\n   /ip firewall nat print and look for the nat rules that are following the\n\n```\naforementioned rules or are suspicious, especially if the `dst-address and` `to-`\n\n`address` are both `public IP addresses.`\ncheck the usernames /user print if you see any unusual username or any of the\nusernames from our IoCs delete them\nIf you can’t access your router on usual ports, you can check one of the alternative\nones in our `IoCs as attackers used to change them to prevent others from taking`\nback ownership of the device.\n[Check the last paragraph of this blog post for more details on how to setup your](https://blog.avast.com/mikrotik-routers-targeted-by-cryptomining-campaign-avast)\nrouter in a safe manner\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSince 2018, vulnerable MikroTik routers have been misused for several campaigns. I\nbelieve, and as some of the IoCs and my research prove, that a botnet offered for service\nhas been in operation since then.\n\n[It also shows, what is quite obvious for some time already (see our Q3 2021 report), that](https://decoded.avast.io/threatresearch/avast-q321-threat-report/)\nIoT devices are being heavily targeted not just to run malware on them, which is hard to\nwrite and spread massively considering all the different architectures and OS versions but\n\n\n-----\n\nto simply use their legal and built-in capabilities to set them up as proxies. This is done to\neither anonymize the attacker’s traces or to serve as a DDoS amplification tool. What we\nsee here is just the tip of the iceberg and it is vital to note that properly and securely setting\nup devices and keeping them up-to-date is crucial to avoid becoming an easy target and\nhelping facilitate criminal activity.\n\nJust recently, [new information popped up showing that the](https://www.imperva.com/blog/imperva-mitigates-ransom-ddos-attack-measuring-2-5-million-requests-per-second/) `REvil ransomware gang is`\nusing MikroTik devices for DDoS attacks. The researchers from `Imperva mention in their`\npost that the Mēris botnet is likely being used to carry out the attack, however, as far as we\n[know the Mēris botnet was dismantled by Russian law enforcement. This a new re-](https://therecord.media/russian-security-firm-sinkholes-part-of-the-dangerous-meris-ddos-botnet/)\nincarnation or the well-known vulnerabilities in MikroTik routers are being exploited again. I\ncan’t tell right now, but what I can tell is that patch adoption and generally, security of IoT\ndevices and routers, in particular, is not good. It’s important to understand that updating\ndevices is not just the sole responsibility of router vendors, but we are all responsible. To\nmake this world more secure, we need to all come together to jointly make sure routers are\nsecure, `so please, take a few minutes now to` `update your routers set up a`\n```\nstrong password, disable the administration interface from the public side,\n\n```\nand help all the others who are not that technically savvy to do so.\n\nNumber of\n\nMikroTik devices with opened port 8921 (WinBox) as found at the date of publication\n(not necessarily vulnerable, source: shodan.io)\n\n\n-----\n\nMikroTik\n\ndevices globally that are exposing any of common services such as FTP, SSH, TELNET,\nWINBOX, PPTP, HTTP as found at the date of publication\n(not necessarily vulnerable, source: shodan.io)\n\n## IoC\n\nMain C2 server:\n\n```\n116.202.93.14\n\n```\n\nGlupteba ARM32 proxy sample:\n\nsha256: a0b07c09e5785098e6b660f93097f931a60b710e1cf16ac554f10476084bffcb\n\nC2 domains:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nrouters.rip\n\n```\n```\ntik.anyget.ru\n\n```\n\nVPN server domain names:\n```\n   s[xx].leappoach.info\n   s[xx].eeongous.com\n\n```\nVPN name (name of VPN interface):\n\n```\nlvpn\n\n```\n\nAlternate SSH ports on routers:\n```\n   26\n   220\n   2222\n   2255\n   3535\n   7022\n   10022\n   12067\n   12355\n   19854\n   22515\n   22192\n   43321\n   51922\n\n```\nAlternate TELNET ports on routers:\n```\n   230\n   32\n   2323\n   2355\n   10023\n   50000\n   52323\n\n```\nAlternate WinBox ports on routers:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n   50001\n   52798\n\n```\nTrickbot “hidden” C2 servers:\n```\n   31.14.40.116\n   45.89.125.253\n   185.10.68.16\n   31.14.40.207\n   185.244.150.26\n   195.123.212.17\n   31.14.40.173\n   88.119.170.242\n   103.145.13.31\n   170.130.55.84\n   45.11.183.152\n   185.212.170.250\n   23.106.124.76\n   31.14.40.107\n   77.247.110.57\n\n```\nTrickBot ports on MikroTik being redirected:\n```\n   449\n   443\n   80\n\n```\nTrickBot ports on hidden servers:\n```\n   447\n   443\n   80\n   8109\n   8119\n   8102\n   8129\n   8082\n   8001\n   8133\n   8121\n\n```\n[Tagged asanalysis,](https://decoded.avast.io/tag/analysis/) [botnet,](https://decoded.avast.io/tag/botnet/) [Glupteba,](https://decoded.avast.io/tag/glupteba/) [Mēris,](https://decoded.avast.io/tag/meris/) [reversing,](https://decoded.avast.io/tag/reversing/) [TrickBot](https://decoded.avast.io/tag/trickbot/)\n\n\n-----",
