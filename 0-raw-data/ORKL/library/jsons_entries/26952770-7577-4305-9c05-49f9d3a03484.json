Derusbi is a family of malware used by multiple actor groups but associated exclusively with Chinese APT. TCIRT began tracking the DTOPTOOLZ signature for additional signed malware samples and memorialized them within our Threat Intelligence Platform over time.\n\n Analyst Comment: The DTOPTOOLZ signature has also been observed in association with Korean Adware that is af�liated with the actual DTOPTOOLZ Co. This adware should not be confused with the APT malware that is abusing the same digital signature.\n\n Later, in mid-November we discovered another implant that was digitally signed with the DTOPTOOLZ signature. This implant,\n MD5: 98721c78dfbf8a45d152a888c804427c[[11]], was from the “Sakula” (aka. Sakurel) family of malware, a known variant of the Derusbi backdoor, and was con�gured to communicate with the malicious command and control (C2) domains extcitrix.we11point[.]com and www.we11point[.]com. Through our\n Farsight Security passive DNS[[12]] integration, we uncovered that this malicious infrastructure was likely named in such a way to impersonate the legitimate Wellpoint IT infrastructure.\n\n\n4 f 33 03/22/2015 10 14 PM\n\n\n-----\n\n### Passive DNS and historic DomainTools Whois data also provided insights that helped establish an initial timeline dating back to April 2014, when the faux domains came into existence and were later operationalized by the attackers. A Threat Intelligence Platform should allow for analysts to easily put together and organize such insights, collaborate around relevant analysis internally, and share the �nished analysis with external industry groups and organizations. In the hopes that our community members could bene�t from or provide further insight into this suspicious incident, we immediately shared our threat intelligence including indicators, signatures and analytical context to the\n ThreatConnect Medical and Health Community[[13]] on November 13, 2014. This included sending out a noti�cation to all\n stakeholders as well as our followers on Twitter[[14]].\n\n When the Anthem breach later came to light in early February, we re-shared the signatures, indicators and context freely to the entire ThreatConnect user base. As we dug further, we expanded our understanding of the malicious we11point[.]com infrastructure, taking particular interest to the subdomains such as “extcitrix.we11point[.]com and “hrsolutions.we11point[.]com”. Note the “citrix” and “hr” (human resources) pre�xes that the adversary used to mirror legitimate remote infrastructure and employee bene�ts resources in the May 2014 timeframe. This provided initial insights as to the likely targeting themes and or vectors in which the adversary may have used when initiating their targeting campaign.\n\n\n5 f 33 03/22/2015 10 14 PM\n\n\n-----\n\n#### [15]\n\n [16]\n\n### The fact that the malicious infrastructure closely mirrored other legitimate Wellpoint infrastructure supported our hypothesis that the Derusbi / Sakula malware was con�gured to operate and persist within a speci�c target enterprise.\n\n## Possible Premera Blue Cross Infrastructure:\n\n### Retrospective analysis of other targeted malware samples using the DTOPTOOLZ Co. digital signature led to the identi�cation of an “HttpBrowser” / “HttpDump” implant MD5:\n 02FAB24461956458D70AEED1A028EB9C[[17]]\n (OpenOf�cePlugin.exe), which was �rst observed on December 11, 2013. Although this malware sample is not Derusbi / Sakula, it too is strongly believed to be associated with Chinese APT activity and in fact may have also been involved in a Blue Cross Blue Shield\n\n\n6 f 33 03/22/2015 10 14 PM\n\n\n-----\n\n### targeting campaign as early as December 2013.\n\n#### [18]\n\n### This particular binary is con�gured to connect to the static IP address 142.91.76[.]134. Passive DNS of this IP indicates that on December 11th, 2013, the same date as the malware sample was observed, the domain prennera[.]com also resolved to 142.91.76[.]134. It is believed that the prennera[.]com domain may have been impersonating the Healthcare provider Premera Blue\n Cross[[19]], where the attackers used the same character replacement technique by replacing the “m” with two “n” characters within the faux domain, the same technique that would\n\n\n7 f 33 03/22/2015 10 14 PM\n\n\n-----\n\n8 f 33 03/22/2015 10 14 PM\n\n\n-----\n\n### investigate these incidents.\n\n As industry analysts and media speculated Chinese APT\n involvement[[20]] in the Anthem breach, our focus into the Derusbi / Sakula malware signed with the DTOPTOOLZ Co. digital signature shifted from the we11point[.]com incident to another cluster of activity that occurred later in May 2014. We immediately\n reviewed Incident 20140526B: vaeit APT[[21]], an incident that we initially shared to our Subscriber Community on September 29, 2014 after conducting retrospective analysis.\n\n#### [22]\n\n [23]\n\n### Just as was the case with the we11point[.]com and prennera[.]com\n\n\n9 f 33 03/22/2015 10 14 PM\n\n\n-----\n\n### incidents, the VAE, Inc. incident is also believed to be associated with Chinese APT espionage activity. In this case the adversary also used Derusbi / Sakula malware that was signed with the DTOPTOOLZ Co. digital signature and con�gured to communicate with faux infrastructure appearing to be masquerading as internal resources for the Department of Defense Contractor VAE, Inc. Additionally, in response to an inquiry from KrebsOnSecurity,\n VAE, Inc. would later con�rm[[24]] that it had indeed been a target of a failed spearphishing attempt in May 2014 which used the malicious faux VAE, Inc. themed domain.\n\n The targeted incident relied upon the Sakula executable MD5:\n 230D8A7A60A07DF28A291B13DDF3351F[[25]] which had a XOR 0x9A encoded C2 callbacks to the IP address 192.199.254[.]126 (registered to Wehostwebsites[.]com – “Tom Yu” of Baoan, Shenzhen City, Guangdong Province, China) as well as a hardcoded callback to sharepoint-vaeit[.]com. Passive DNS of the static C2 IP 192.199.254[.]126 revealed a single suspicious domain of interest – topsec2014[.]com. This domain had historic resolution around May 8, 2014 within a month of the �rst observed Sakula activity using the IP 192.199.254[.]126 as C2.\n\n#### [26]\n\n\n10 f 33 03/22/2015 10 14 PM\n\n\n-----\n\n#### [27]\n\n### Using historic Whois, we discovered that topsec2014[.]com was initially registered by li2384826402@yahoo[.]com on May 6th,\n\n 2014. Although the li2384826402@yahoo[.]com registrant is likely a reseller given that it has been observed registering several thousands of other domains, the fact that it was used to register both the faux VAE, Inc. C2 infrastructure and the overlapping domain topsec2014[.]com within the same month suggests that there may be a relationship between the client of the reseller for the VAE, Inc. infrastructure and the client for topsec2014[.]com.\n\n#### [28]\n\n\n11 f 33 03/22/2015 10 14 PM\n\n\n-----\n\n#### [29]\n\n### Just four minutes after the initial registration of topsec2014[.]com, the Whois records were updated from the initial registrant, Li Ning – li2384826402@yahoo[.]com to TopSec China – TopSec_2014@163[.]com. This domain record has been unchanged since May 7th 2014. The we11point[.]com infrastructure and by extension the faux VAE Inc. infrastructure is\n associated with Cluster 2 of the ScanBox framework[[30]] by PwC. The latest PwC update to ScanBox states that there are “links between the domain allegedly used in the Anthem hack (we11point.com) to Cluster 2 through shared WHOIS details.”\n\n## OPM Themed Infrastructure\n\n### One notable pattern was how the domain Whois registration information for the VAE, Inc. themed infrastructure was quickly updated and obfuscated with pseudorandom 10 character gmx.com email addresses and using the names of various comic book characters from the Iron Man franchise. This comic-themed naming convention has been previously documented by our\n friends at Crowdstrike[[31]] in what they characterize as being associated with a Chinese APT group they have dubbed “Deep Panda”.\n\n Leveraging our DomainTools partnership, we were able to\n\n\n12 f 33 03/22/2015 10 14 PM\n\n\n-----\n\n### correlate the outlier domain opm-learning[.]org. This domain was also purportedly registered by the Iron Man movie hero “Tony Stark” on July 28, 2014. This infrastructure naming convention suggests a possible Of�ce of Personnel Management (OPM) theme. However, in this case we lacked any speci�c sample of malware to verify our initial suspicions that this infrastructure was operational. The possible OPM reference in the domain name is noteworthy considering it was revealed in July of 2014 that OPM\n had been compromised[[32]] by a likely state-sponsored Chinese actor in mid-March of that year. The fact this domain was\n\n registered after the breach occurred suggests that OPM could be an ongoing direct target of Chinese state-sponsored cyber espionage activity.\n\n Our attention then turned to the FBI Flash Report A-000049 MW[[33]] that was publicly reported by Brian Krebs [[34]]on February 6th, 2015. This FBI Flash Report was issued on January 27th, 2015, the same day an Anthem administrator detected suspicious\n activity according to an internal memo[[35]]. This memo goes on to indicate that the FBI would not be party to the Anthem breach until they were noti�ed on January 29th, 2015; based on these facts we assess with high con�dence that it is very unlikely that the FBI Flash Report was directly related to the Anthem breach. Rather, we suspect that the FBI �ash report likely references the\n USIS breach that was announced[[36]] on August 6, 2014, or the previous OPM breach, considering the statement that the breach involved “compromised and stolen sensitive business information and Personally Identi�able Information (PII) from US commercial and\n\n\n13 f 33 03/22/2015 10 14 PM\n\n\n-----\n\n14 f 33 03/22/2015 10 14 PM\n\n\n-----\n\n15 f 33 03/22/2015 10 14 PM\n\n\n-----\n\n### address wasn’t an exact match to the topsec2014[.]com domain registrant (notice the absence of the underscore), such a similarity warranted further investigation.\n\n#### [39]\n\n [40]\n\n\n16 f 33 03/22/2015 10 14 PM\n\n\n-----\n\n### We examined the links for any relevant intelligence, and discovered that nearly all of the search results led to pages that contained an announcement for an information security competition sponsored by the Southeast University-Topsec Information Security and Mobile Internet Technology Joint Research Center. This entity appears to be a joint research venture between the University and Chinese networking giant Beijing Topsec Network Security Technology Co., a.k.a. Beijing Topsec.\n\n#### [41]\n\n\n17 f 33 03/22/2015 10 14 PM\n\n\n-----\n\n#### [42]\n\n### The announcements list a Professor “Song Yubo” as the point of contact for the event, and directs interested parties to his email address, topsec2014@163[.]com, for further questions.\n\n#### [43]\n\n [44]\n\n### According to his LinkedIn page, Song is a Teacher at the Southeast\n\n University, speci�cally interested in the �eld of telecommunications. Additionally, he is an avid researcher, and has published numerous academic papers on computer network exploitation on various e-journal publication sites, such as Google\n Scholar[[45]]. Further, he lists skills such as “cryptography,” “penetration testing” and “computer network security,” etc. on his\n Research Gate pro�le[[46]].\n\n\n18 f 33 03/22/2015 10 14 PM\n\n\n-----\n\n#### [47]\n\n [48]\n\n### As we continued to develop a pro�le on Professor Song, we began to have the sense that his interest in information security research strongly overlapped with that of someone who might be interested in or at least capable of conducting sophisticated cyber attacks. However, interests alone are not enough to warrant reasonable suspicion, so we had to do more digging.\n\n Additionally, the soft link between TopSec_2014@163[.]com and topsec2014@163[.]com alone was not suf�cient to make\n\n\n19 f 33 03/22/2015 10 14 PM\n\n\n-----\n\n### associations with any reasonable con�dence, but as it turns out, Yubo has in fact been previously named as a person of interest in the context of offensive Chinese cyber activity.\n\n## The University\n\n### In March 2012, Northrop Grumman presented a commissioned\n report to Congress[[49]] detailing Chinese cyber warfare capabilities. The report asserts with high con�dence that both Song and the Information Security Research Center at Southeast University have received numerous state-sponsored research grants, and by extension, cooperated with the Government of China in conducting information security research and development (R&D). As stated on Southeast University’s own website, the main purpose of these grants are to develop technical acumen amongst its students via providing support for “state-owned scienti�c research institutions, state key enterprises, government agencies and People’s Liberation Army (PLA) units.”\n\n#### [50]\n\n\n20 f 33 03/22/2015 10 14 PM\n\n\n-----\n\n#### [51]\n\n### Southeast University is one of only three Chinese academic institutes that receives funding from all �ve of the State grant programs. Song himself has also conducted his fair share of state- sponsored research, notably under the National Ministry of State Security 115 Program – a highly sensitive research grant to fund ambiguous information warfare R&D, almost certainly in support of PLA programs.\n\n## The Competition\n\n### As we can see, the evidence continued to stack up. The real smoking gun, however, was when we began to notice a strong temporal overlap with the various stages of the TOPSEC Cup that\n\n Song and Beijing Topsec were organizing, and the registration dates of malicious infrastructure as well as the malware compilation dates.\n\n#### [52]\n\n\n21 f 33 03/22/2015 10 14 PM\n\n\n-----\n\n#### [53]\n\n### Based upon the translated registration form that we obtained from Song Yubo’s personal Baidu document sharing account, open registration for the “TOPSEC Cup” began on May 4th, 2014 and would close on May 14th, 2014.\n\n The details of the competition that were shared on the announcement are extremely ambiguous, and probably for good reason. The introductory paragraph mentions that the primary goal of the event is to facilitate the training and discovery of new talent, noting that exceptional participants would receive priority consideration for internships and jobs with Beijing Topsec.\n\n The event itself was broken down into several distinct rounds of competition. Firstly, the preliminary round required that all eligible registrants would attempt to remotely access and navigate through the network. Should a participating team perform exceptionally in the preliminary qualifying round, they would be invited to participate in the �nal round on-site in Nanjing.\n\n\n22 f 33 03/22/2015 10 14 PM\n\n\n-----\n\n23 f 33 03/22/2015 10 14 PM\n\n\n-----\n\n### Sakula implant is was likely an error made by the attackers.\n\n## Tianrongxin, a.k.a. Beijing Topsec Technology Co:\n\n The Company\n\n### To enhance our open-source capabilities, we partnered up with Dr.\n James Mulvenon[[54]] and his team of China experts at Defense\n Group, Inc. (DGI)[[55]]. We shared with them everything that we knew at the time, walking through the technical details which led us all the way to Song Yubo and the competition announcement. From there, they were able to uncover a wealth of very consequential background information on Beijing Topsec Technology Co (Beijing Topsec), the sponsoring organization for Song Yubo’s information security competition.\n\n DGI’s research indicated that Beijing Topsec is one of the largest information security hardware providers in China. In 1996, they were the �rst Chinese company to break into the market with the release of China’s �rst indigenously-manufactured �rewall. Since then, they have expanded their business to include a consulting practice focused on issues such as vulnerability mining, software code analysis, threat intelligence, and encryption R&D, amongst other things.\n\n The company served as a core technical support unit for network\n\n\n24 f 33 03/22/2015 10 14 PM\n\n\n-----\n\n### security at the 2008 Olympic Games – an event which was tightly controlled by the state. Additionally, Beijing Topsec is a known partner of the Chinese military. Since 2009, the company has possessed information publication credentials for military network procurement. Since 2013, they have been publicly recognized as the Chinese equivalent of a cleared defense contractor.\n\n The links between Beijing Topsec and the Chinese government are fairly substantial, highlighted by long-standing partnerships between even the most shadowy elements of the Chinese military.\n\n## The Leaked Cable\n\n### A very compelling piece of evidence is found in the contents of a leaked 2009 diplomatic security cable from the Department of\n State, published by The Guardian.[[56]] The cable is a daily digest of Diplomatic Security alerts – essentially a situational awareness primer for State Department employees to inform them of new and existing threats. In one section, the cable highlights that the Founder of Beijing Topsec, He Weidong, had openly talked about receiving directives from the PLA in an interview with China News Network. In the interview, the founder quite curiously states that Topsec is less a commercial entity, but rather a research institute, and that the company received about half of its start-up capital directly from the PLA. The cable further claims that Topsec actively recruits for the PLA cyber army.\n\n\n25 f 33 03/22/2015 10 14 PM\n\n\n-----\n\n26 f 33 03/22/2015 10 14 PM\n\n\n-----\n\n27 f 33 03/22/2015 10 14 PM\n\n\n-----\n\n### especially when countless naming conventions are applied. Without the use of a Threat Intelligence Platform to keep track of the �ood of incoming threat data, this task would be extraordinarily time consuming at best and crippling at worst.\n\n Moving forward, it is important to bear in mind that the adversary, regardless of country of origin, shall almost certainly leverage our every weakness against us. Even something as seemingly innocuous as confusion over names can easily consume analytical bandwidth, creating a window of opportunity to strike. We – that is security professionals, private industry and governments alike – must proactively harden our network defenses and hasten our incident responses as a united, synchronous entity.\n\n We have shared details on Song Yubo[[60]] and af�liated indicators within the ThreatConnect Common Community. This share also\n includes the full-text DGI “BLUE HERON” research[[61]] which provides greater insight into Song Yubo, Southeast University and Beijing Topsec.\n\n All things considered, industry must learn to adopt a cooperative defense mindset in the hopes of rebuf�ng future attacks. The most resolute defense we have is each other, so be like the TCIRT and start actively defending your own community from the next big\n breach.
