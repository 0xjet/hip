Symantec researchers observed it being used in some activity in 2020 and 2021, as well as this more recent\ncampaign, which continued into the first quarter of 2023. The motivation behind both these campaigns is believed to be\nintelligence gathering.\n\nThe backdoor is used very selectively, appearing on just a handful of networks and a small number of machines over the\nyears, with its use appearing to be highly targeted. The attackers in this campaign also have access to an updated version\nof the ZXShell rootkit.\n\nThe targets in this most recent activity, which began in mid-2022 and continued into 2023, are based in South and\nSoutheast Asia, in sectors including government, aviation, education, and telecoms. Symantec researchers previously saw\nthe Merdoor backdoor used in activity that targeted victims in the same geographies in the government, communications,\nand technology sectors in 2020 into 2021. Like this recent activity, that activity also appeared to be highly targeted, with\nonly a small number of machines infected.\n\n## Merdoor Backdoor\n\nMerdoor is a fully-featured backdoor that appears to have been in existence since 2018.\n\nThe backdoor contains the following functionality:\n\nInstalling itself as a service\nKeylogging\nA variety of methods to communicate with its command-and-control (C&C) server (HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, UDP, TCP)\nAbility to listen on a local port for commands\n\nInstances of the Merdoor backdoor are usually identical with the exception of embedded and encrypted configuration,\nwhich determines:\n\nC&C communication method\nService details\nInstallation directory\n\nTypically, the backdoor is injected into the legitimate processes perfhost.exe or svchost.exe.\n\nThe Merdoor dropper is a self-extracting RAR (SFX) that contains three files:\n\n\n-----\n\nA legitimate and signed binary vulnerable to DLL search order hijacking\nA malicious loader (Merdoor loader)\nAn encrypted file (.pak) containing final payload (Merdoor backdoor)\n\nWhen opened, the dropper extracts embedded files and executes a legitimate binary in order to load the Merdoor loader.\n\nMerdoor dropper variants have been found that abuse older versions of five different legitimate applications for the purpose\nof DLL sideloading:\n\nTable 1. List of legitimate applications abused by Merdoor for DLL sideloading.\n\n\n**Loader (Merdoor**\n**loader)**\n\n\n**Encrypted payload**\n**(Merdoor backdoor)**\n\n\n**Legitimate binary** **Version**\n\n\n**Date**\n**signed**\n\n\nSiteAdv.exe (McAfee SiteAdvisor) 1.6.0.23 08/10/2006 SiteAdv.dll SiteAdv.pak\n\n\nssr32.exe (Sophos SafeStore\nRestore)\n\nchrome_frame_helper.exe\n(Google Chrome Frame)\n\n\n1.3.0.1 11/17/2017 safestore32.dll safestore.pak\n\n27.0.1453.110 05/29/2013 chrome_frame_helper.dll chrome_frame_helper.pak\n\n\nwsc_proxy.exe (Avast wsc_proxy) 1.0.0.3 10/28/2019 wsc.dll proxycfg.pak\n\ncoInst.exe (Norton Identity Safe) 2014.7.3.12 06/26/2014 msvcr100.dll coinstcfg.dat\n\n## Attack Chain\n\nEvidence from Lancefly’s earlier campaign that began in 2020 suggested that in that instance the group may have used a\nphishing email with a lure based on the 37th ASEAN Summit as an initial infection vector.\n\nIn this more recent activity, the initial infection vector was not entirely clear. We saw some indications of what the initial\ninfection vector may have been in two victims, though this was not conclusive.\n\nIn one of the government sector victims, there were indications that the initial infection vector may have been SSH\nbrute forcing. Multiple open-source sources associate one of the IP addresses used by the threat actors in this activity\nwith SSH brute forcing, indicating that the initial infection vector was possibly SSH brute forcing.\nIn another victim, a file path (Csidl_program_files\\loadbalancer\\ibm\\edge\\lb\\servers\\bin) indicates a load balancer\nmay have been exploited for access, indicating that the initial infection vector may have been an exposed publicfacing server.\n\nWhile evidence for any of these infection vectors is not definitive, it does appear to indicate that Lancefly is adaptable when\nit comes to the kind of infection vectors it uses.\n\n**Credential theft using non-malware techniques**\n\nIn activity that also aligned with their earlier campaign in 2020/2021, the attackers used a number of non-malware\ntechniques for credential theft on victim machines:\n\nPowerShell was used to launch rundll32.exe in order to dump the memory of a process using the MiniDump function\nof comsvcs.dll. This technique is often used to dump LSASS memory.\nReg.exe was used to dump the SAM and SYSTEM registry hives.\nA legitimate tool by Avast was installed by the attackers and used to dump LSASS memory.\n\nThe attackers also used a masqueraded version of the legitimate archiving tool WinRAR to stage and encrypt files before\nexfiltration.\n\n**Notable attack chain tools and TTPs**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Impacket Atexec: A dual use tool that can be used by malicious actors to create and run an immediate scheduled**\ntask on a remote target via SMB in order to execute commands on a target system. It is used by Lancefly for lateral\nmovement across victim networks, also possibly for shellcode execution and evasion. It may have been used to\ndelete cmdline output files.\n**Suspicious SMB activity: Suspicious SMB activity is seen on numerous victim machines. This is likely related to the**\nuse of Impacket by the threat actors.\n**WinRAR: An archive manager that can be used to archive or zip files – for example, prior to exfiltration. It is not clear**\nhow the attackers exfiltrate the data from victim machines, but it is most likely via Merdoor.\n**LSSAS Dumper: Allows the attackers to swiftly steal credentials they can then use to gain further access across**\nvictim networks.\n**[NBTScan: Open-source command-line NetBIOS scanner. This can be used to gather information on a network.](http://www.unixwiz.net/tools/nbtscan.html)**\n**Blackloader and Prcloader: Loaders used by the group. These loaders were also both used in earlier Merdoor**\nactivity in 2020 and 2021. They have been linked to the delivery of PlugX. Both loaders appear to be sideloaded onto\nvictim machines. It is not clear if these loaders are exclusively used by Lancefly or if their use is shared across\nmultiple groups.\n\nA typical Merdoor attack chain, as seen in one of the victims, appears to be:\n\nMerdoor injected into either perfhost.exe or svchost.exe.\nSuspicious SMB activity is then normally observed, and the backdoor connects to its C&C server.\nThis is often followed by suspicious living-off-the-land activity, such as the execution of commands like mavinject.exe\n(which can be used for process injection) and createdump.exe (which can be used to dump a process e.g. LSASS).\nA masqueraded WinRAR (wmiprvse.exe) file is then used to stage and encrypt files, presumably prior to exfiltration.\nWe do not actually see the files being exfiltrated from victim networks, but we presume the Merdoor backdoor itself is\nused to exfiltrate them.\n\n## ZXShell Rootkit Technical Details\n\nThe ZXShell rootkit was [first reported on by Cisco in 2014, but the version of the tool used by Lancefly is updated,](https://web.archive.org/web/20170921211856/https:/blogs.cisco.com/security/talos/opening-zxshell)\nindicating that it continues to be actively developed. The source code of this rootkit is publicly available so it may be used\nby multiple different groups. The new version of the rootkit used by Lancefly appears to be smaller in size, while it also has\nadditional functions and targets additional antivirus software to disable.\n\n**Loader**\n\nThe loader for the rootkit is a 32-bit DLL with the export directory name \"FormDll.dll\" (SHA256:\n1f09d177c99d429ae440393ac9835183d6fd1f1af596089cc01b68021e2e29a7).\n\nIt has the following exports:\n\n\"CallDriver\"\n\"DoRVA\"\n\"KillAvpProcess\"\n\"LoadSys\"\n\"ProtectDllFile\"\n\n**Export \"Loadsys\"**\n\nWhenever the export \"LoadSys\" is executed, it drops one of the following files based on the processor architecture:\n\n\"[WindowsDirectory]\\system32\\drivers\\TdiProxy.sys\"\n\"[WindowsDirectory]\\system64\\drivers\\TdiProxy.sys\"\n\n[These files are a malicious Windows Kernel driver. This is a variant of a driver that was first documented in an RSA blog](https://web.archive.org/web/20170710123617/https:/blogs.rsa.com/cat-phishing/)\nseveral years ago.\n\nIt has the PDB filename: \"c:\\google\\objchk_win7_amd64\\amd64\\Google.pdb\"\n\nThe sample creates the device: \"\\Device\\TdiProxy0\".\n\n\n-----\n\nIt also creates the symbolic link \\DosDevices\\TdiProxy0, so that it can be controlled using the pathname _\\\\.\\TdiProxy0 ._\n\nAfter this, the loader timestamps the dropped file by copying the timestamps from the file \"\n\n[WindowsDirectory]\\system32\\drivers\\http.sys\".\n\nThen it creates a service with the following parameters:\n\nServiceName = \"TdiProxy0\"\nDisplayName = \"TdiProxy0\" (later replaced with \"TdiProxy\")\nBinaryPathName = \"[WindowsDirectory]\\system32\\drivers\\TdiProxy.sys\"\n\n**Export \"CallDriver\"**\n\n\"CallDriver\" opens the following device, which was created by the “\\\\.\\TdiProxy0” malicious kernel driver.\n\nIt communicates with it using the DeviceIoControl API.\n\nThe export expects two arguments. The first argument determines the dwIoControlCode parameter to use when calling the\n_DeviceIoControl API and it should be one of the following strings:_\n\n\"-init\",\n\"-file\",\n\"-pack\",\n\"-port\",\n\"-removetcpview\",\n\"-tcpview\",\n\"-clearall\",\n\"-clear\",\n\"-transport\",\n\"-waitport\",\n\"-kill\",\n\"-antiscan\",\n\"-removeprocessnotify\",\n\"-setprocessnotify\",\n\"-antiantigp\",\n\"-hideproc\",\n\"-hidekey\",\n\"-hidefile\",\n\"-setprotect\",\n\nAny other values result in what looks like a buggy dwIoControlCode value. The second argument is a string to pass as an\nlpInBuffer parameter when calling the DeviceIoControl API, after conversion using the MultiByteToWideChar API.\n\n**Export \"DoRVA\"**\n\nWhenever the export \"DoRVA\" is executed, it reads the following file:\n\n\"[file_directory_of_the_DLL]\\Form.hlp\"\n\nThe file should start with the magic string \"AP32\" and contains shellcode to execute in compressed form.\n\n**Export \"KillAvpProcess\"**\n\nThis enumerates running processes and for selected processes and calls its own export \"CallDriver\" with the following\nparameters:\n\nfirst parameter: \"-kill\"\n\nsecond parameter: \"[ProcessID]\"\n\n\n-----\n\nThe export expects a single string parameter to compare with the executable file of running processes for selection.\n\n**Export \"ProtectDllFile\"**\n\nThis calls its own export \"CallDriver\" with the following parameters:\n\nfirst parameter: \"-file\"\n\nsecond parameter: \"[file_path_of_the_DLL]\"\n\nNext, it sets the following registry value:\n\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\.ptdf\\\"ptdffile\" = \"[file_path_of_the_DLL]\"\n\n**Loadpoint**\n\nThis is a 32-bit executable with the PDB filename: \"M:\\Project\\database\\10.0.18362\\Form\\Release\\Form.pdb\". (SHA256:\n180970fce4a226de05df6d22339dd4ae03dfd5e451dcf2d464b663e86c824b8e)\n\nWhenever the sample is executed, it loads the following DLL:\n\n\"[file_path_of_the_running_executable]\\FormDll.dll\"\n\nIt also calls its export: \"DoRVA\".\n\n**Installation and Update Utility**\n\nThe installation and update utility is a 32-bit PE executable (SHA256:\na6020794bd6749e0765966cd65ca6d5511581f47cc2b38e41cb1e7fddaa0b221) that shares small but distinctive fragments\nof code with the Merdoor loader, which is what indicates they are part of the same toolset.\n\nWhenever the sample is executed, it attempts to read and delete the following file containing its configuration data:\n\n\"[file_directory_of_running_executable]\\res.ini\"\n\n**Update functionality**\n\nNext, it checks that:\n\n\"\\\\.\\TdiProxy0\" device is available, and\n\nThat its own process was started with the command-line parameter \"-up\".\n\nIf both checks pass, the sample attempts to tamper with various antivirus products using the \"\\\\.\\TdiProxy0\" device. For\nexample, it may terminate the processes \"egui.exe\", \"ekrn.exe\", and \"msmpeng.exe\".\n\nNext, it attempts to rename the file \"[FILE_DIRECTORY_OF_RUNNING_EXECUTABLE]\\res.dat\" as one of the following\n(depending on the Windows version):\n\n\"[SystemDrive]\\Users\\All Users\\Windows Defender\\temp.temp\"\n\n\"[WindowsDirectory]\\temp.temp\".\n\nBased on the structure of the code, the above file should start with the magic string \"AP32\" and could contain a DLL file in\ncompressed form. The sample then decompresses the renamed file \"temp.temp\". When decompressing, it may create the\ntemporary file \"temp.temp.pack\" in the same folder.\n\nNext, the sample appends a certain marker followed by the content of \"\n\n[FILE_DIRECTORY_OF_RUNNING_EXECUTABLE]\\res.ini\" (partially transformed using the XOR algorithm with the byte\nkey 0x12) at the end of the decompressed file.\n\nAdditionally, it also creates the following registry value:\n\n\n-----\n\nHKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\.udf\\ BINTYPE  [content of [file_directory_of_running_executable]\\res.ini (partially\ntransformed using the XOR algorithm with the byte key 0x12)]\n\nThen the sample checks if the following file exists:\n\n\"[SystemDrive]\\Users\\All Users\\Windows Defender\\DefenderSvc.dll\"\n\nIf so, the sample renames the updated \"temp.temp\" file to replace it.\n\nOtherwise, it checks the following registry value for the pathname to replace:\n\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\.ecdf\\\"ecdffile\"\n\nIf that fails, it uses a default from configuration data.\n\nFinally, it checks the following registry value for a service name:\n\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\.tudf\\\"tudffile\"\n\nIt restarts the referred service.\n\n**Installation functionality**\n\nThe sample attempts to decompress the following file:\n\n\"[FILE_DIRECTORY_OF_RUNNING_EXECUTABLE]\\google64.p\" (64-bit processor architecture), or\n\"[FILE_DIRECTORY_OF_RUNNING_EXECUTABLE]\\google32.p\" (32-bit processor architecture)\n\nas:\n\n\"[WindowsDirectory]\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework64\\iesockethlp.dll\" (64-bit processor architecture), or\n\"[WindowsDirectory]\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\iesockethlp.dll\" (32-bit processor architecture)\n\nThen it may modify one of the following registry values to hijack the corresponding service:\n\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\exfat\\\"ImagePath\" = \"\\??\\\n\n[PATHNAME_OF_FILE_DECOMPRESSED_ABOVE]\", or\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\RDPWD\\\"ImagePath\" = \"\\??\\\n\n[PATHNAME_OF_FILE_DECOMPRESSED_ABOVE]\"\n\nNext, it starts the corresponding service and then removes the registry value. It then attempts to tamper with various\nantivirus products using the \"\\\\.\\TdiProxy0\" device.\n\nIt then creates a service with the following parameters:\n\nServiceName: \"[PER CONFIGURATION DATA]\"\nImagePath:\n\n\"%SystemRoot%\\System32\\svchost.exe -k netsvcs\", or\n\"%SystemRoot%\\System32\\svchost.exe -k ntmssvcs\"\nParameters:\n\nServiceDll:\n\n\"C:\\WINDOWS\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework64\\[PER CONFIGURATION DATA]\", or\n\"C:\\WINDOWS\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\[PER CONFIGURATION DATA]\"\n\nThen it creates the following registry value:\n\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\.tudf\\\"tudffile\" = [NAME OF CREATED SERVICE]\n\nIt then deletes the following registry values:\n\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\.ptdf\\\"ptdffile\"\nHKEY LOCAL MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\.ecdf\\\"ecdffile\"\n\n\n-----\n\nNext, it renames the following file:\n\n\"[FILE_DIRECTORY_OF_RUNNING_EXECUTABLE]\\res.dat\"\n\nas:\n\n\"[WindowsDirectory]\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework64\\[PER CONFIGURATION DATA].back\" (64-bit processor\narchitecture), or\n\"[WindowsDirectory]\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\[PER CONFIGURATION DATA].back\" (32-bit processor architecture)\n\nBased on the structure of the code, the above file should start with the magic string \"AP32\" and could contain a DLL file in\ncompressed form (using aPLib for compression).\n\nThe sample then decompresses the renamed \"[PER CONFIGURATION DATA].back\" as \"[PER CONFIGURATION DATA]\".\n\nNext, the sample appends a certain marker followed by the content of \"\n\n[FILE_DIRECTORY_OF_RUNNING_EXECUTABLE]\\res.ini\" (partially transformed using the XOR algorithm with the byte\nkey 0x12) at the end of the decompressed file.\n\nAdditionally, it also creates the following registry value:\n\nHKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\.udf\\\"BINTYPE\" = [content of \"[FILE_DIRECTORY_OF_RUNNING_EXECUTABLE]\\res.ini\"\n(partially transformed using the XOR algorithm with the byte key 0x12)]\n\nFinally, when the configuration data includes the option \"OneSelfKey\", it makes a compressed copy of its own executable\nas (using aPLib for compression):\n\n\"[WindowsDirectory]\\SysWOW64\\nethlp.hlp\" (64-bit processor architecture), or\n\"[WindowsDirectory]\\system32\\nethlp.hlp\" (32-bit processor architecture).\n\nSome samples include an embedded archive with the final payload:\n\n\"Msrpcsvc.dll\"\n\nThis is a variant of the ZXShell backdoor (SHA256:\nd5df686bb202279ab56295252650b2c7c24f350d1a87a8a699f6034a8c0dd849).\n\n## Possible Links to Other Groups\n\nThe ZXShell rootkit used by Lancefly is signed by the certificate \"Wemade Entertainment Co. Ltd\", which was previously\nreported to be associated with APT41 (aka Blackfly/Grayfly). However, it is known that Chinese APT groups, such as\nAPT41, [often share certificates with other APT groups. The ZXShell backdoor has also previously been used by the](https://intrusiontruth.wordpress.com/2022/07/24/chinese-apts-interlinked-networks-and-side-hustles/)\nHiddenLynx/APT17 group, but as the source code of ZXShell is now publicly available this does not provide a definitive link\nbetween these two groups.\n\nAlso notable is that the ZXShell rootkit loader component has the name \"formdll.dll\" and it has the ability to read the file\n\"Form.hlp\" and execute its contents as shellcode. Those same files were mentioned as being used in a previous report\n[detailing activity by the Iron Tiger (aka Budworm/APT27) group. In that case, the attackers used these filenames when](https://paper.seebug.org/papers/APT/APT_CyberCriminal_Campagin/2015/2015.09.17.Operation_Iron_Tiger/wp-operation-iron-tiger.pdf)\nloading the PlugX backdoor onto victim machines. The prevalence of such files is very low, which may indicate a potential\nlink between that campaign and this more recent activity.\n\nPlugX is also seen being used by Lancefly. PlugX is a remote access Trojan (RAT) with multiple functionalities including\nbackdoor access and data exfiltration. PlugX has existed for well over a decade. It was originally used by Chinese APT\ngroups, but its use is now very widespread, meaning it is difficult to use it as a way of attributing activity.\n\nShadowPad is also used by these attackers. ShadowPad is a modular RAT believed to be exclusively used by Chinese\nAPT groups. Its capabilities are similar to PlugX, and it is often referred to as a successor to that malware.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile these overlaps and shared tools may indicate some links between Lancefly activity and activity by other APT groups,\nnone of the overlaps are strong enough to attribute this activity and the development of the Merdoor backdoor to an\nalready-known attack group.\n\n## Noteworthy Backdoor, Targeted Activity\n\nThis recent Lancefly activity is of note due to its use of the Merdoor backdoor, but also the low prevalence of this backdoor\nand the seemingly highly targeted nature of these attacks. While the Merdoor backdoor appears to have been in existence\nfor several years, it appears to only have been used in a small number of attacks in that time period. This prudent use of\nthe tool may indicate a desire by Lancefly to keep its activity under the radar.\n\nThe tools used and sectors targeted all point to the motivations of this attack campaign being intelligence gathering. The\nsimilarities between this recent activity and earlier activity by Lancefly indicate that the group perhaps did not realize the\nearlier activity had been discovered, so it was not concerned about links being made between the two. Whether or not the\nexposure of this activity will lead to any alteration in how the group carries out its activity remains to be seen.\n\n## Protection\n\n[For the latest protection updates, please
