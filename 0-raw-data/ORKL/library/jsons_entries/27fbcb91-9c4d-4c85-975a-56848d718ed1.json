The connection to the Lazarus group was obvious by inspecting the tools,\nstrategies, and methods already linked to the North Korean actor.\n\nFor instance, Rising Sun was observed in attacks before the discovery of 'Sharpshooter' and\nshared the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) seen in operations attributed to\nLazarus group.\n\nThe three variants of the backdoor (v1.0, v1.1, and v2.0) indicate a clear evolution from\nDuuzer, used by Lazarus, as they all include its core capabilities.\n\n\n-----\n\n\"These [Rising Sun] implants were all based on the original Backdoor Duuzer source code,\"\nthe researchers say in their report.\n\nThe high similarity of the fake job recruitment campaigns both groups used to disguise their\nattacks, and the fact that Lazarus relied on similar versions of Rising Sun in activity tracked\nin 2017, point to a connection between the two adversaries.\n\n## Malicious components in the framework\n\n\n-----\n\nAnalyzing the code and data from the C2, Ryan Sherstobitoff and Asheer Malhotra from\nMcAfee, along with the company's Advanced Threat Research Team (ATR), discovered new\nvariants of the Rising Sun backdoor that were used since at least 2016.\n\n\"The server was used to distribute and infect victims with an upgraded version of Rising Sun\nwith SSL capabilities,\" informs a report shared with BleepingComputer.\n\nThe rare opportunity to examine Sharpshooter's backend operations allowed the researchers\nto create a fuller picture of the activity and interaction between the various tools used by the\nthreat actor.\n\nLocal recreation of Sharpshooter's C2 main panel\nGetting access to the C2 information helped the researchers get a clear view of the\nattacker's operations and utilities. It also provided sufficient details to quickly improve\ndetection of malicious activity from this threat by uncovering new tools otherwise hidden by\nobfuscation techniques.\n\nAn alternative method for discovering them is by analyzing network packets, which is more\ndifficult and requires more time.\n\n\n-----\n\nAnother finding in the activity of 'Sharpshooter' were a set of unobfuscated connections from\nIP addresses in Windhoek, a city in Namibia, Africa. One explanation for this could be\nthat that they used the region as a test zone; another would be that the threat actor runs the\noperation from those locations, although it could also be a false flag meant to point the\nresearchers on the wrong path.\n\nWhen 'Sharpshooter' was first discovered, it was believed that the operation started in\nOctober 2018. However, a log file on the server indicates that the C2 framework has been\nactive since at least September 2017, and probably \"hosted on different servers over time.\"\n\nThe threat actor [first detected towards the end of last year when it attacked at least 87](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/op-sharpshooter-uses-lazarus-group-tactics-techniques-and-procedures/)\norganizations around the world in two months' time. Its activity is ongoing.\n\n[McAfee researchers will present their findings at this year's RSA security conference in San](https://www.rsaconference.com/events/us19)\nFrancisco.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Hackers are now hiding malware in Windows Event Logs](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-are-now-hiding-malware-in-windows-event-logs/)\n\n[Cyberspies use IP cameras to deploy backdoors, steal Exchange emails](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cyberspies-use-ip-cameras-to-deploy-backdoors-steal-exchange-emails/)\n\n[DPRK hackers go after crypto assets using trojanized DeFi Wallet app](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/dprk-hackers-go-after-crypto-assets-using-trojanized-defi-wallet-app/)\n\n[BPFDoor malware uses Solaris vulnerability to get root privileges](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/bpfdoor-malware-uses-solaris-vulnerability-to-get-root-privileges/)\n\n[BPFDoor: Stealthy Linux malware bypasses firewalls for remote access](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/bpfdoor-stealthy-linux-malware-bypasses-firewalls-for-remote-access/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Ionut Ilascu](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/ionut-ilascu/)\n\nIonut Ilascu is a technology writer with a focus on all things cybersecurity.
