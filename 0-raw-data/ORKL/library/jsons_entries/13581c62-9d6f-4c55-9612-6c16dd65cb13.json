One of the most typical cases is the\nTomato Garden case,[1] where several different groups used the same zero-day Microsoft Word\nexploit. The term “used” means that they somehow get hold of a document that exploited the\nvulnerability, and then left the exploiting document part and the shellcode intact, only changed\nthe appended encrypted executable at the end, and immediately they had what needed.\n\nSomething very similar happened just recently, in August and September of 2014.\n\nI always wanted to know how the malware writing groups worked. I mean the really serious ones,\nthe ones behind Chinese state-sponsored APT attacks, or the groups behind high profile common\nmalware, like Zeus.\n\nThis case offers another piece of insight. There must have been a staff meeting, where the\nmanager prompted that, in the next malware distribution campaign they should not only use\nthe aging CVE-2012-0158 vulnerability, but the newer CVE-2014-1761 as well. The rest of the\ndocument will detail how some of the groups coped with this task.\n\nClearly, the malware authors took a sample somehow and started the implementation process.\nI wasn’t there, of course, so what follows is an educated guess based on the samples.\n\n#### Template 1: CVE-2012-0158 + CVE-2014-1761 Combo\nRecently we saw a lot of samples that exploit both CVE-2012-0158 and CVE-2014-1761, and\nusually either download or drop a Zbot variant.\n\nThe document starts with the RTF header stuff, followed by the encrypted second stage.\n\nThis is followed by the embedded object exploiting the CVE-2012-0158 vulnerability with the\nshellcode. Following it is a block exploiting the CVE-2014-1761 with a shellcode of its own,\nas illustrated in the image below.\n\nThe color scheme I will use in the rest of the document is the following: green represents\nthe properly used components; yellow the unused components; and red the incorrectly\nused components.\n\nEncrypted Zbot\n\nCVE-2012-0158 exploit and Zbot shellcode\n\nCVE-2014-1761 exploit and Zbot shellcode\n\nRegardless of the particular exploit used, both shellcodes performed the memory egg-hunting\nfor the memory markers of the second stage (as described in[2]), and decrypted it when found.\nThe second stage could be either a downloader shellcode or a Win32 executable.\n\nOne of these samples was SHA1: c3a7cb43ec13299b758cb8ca25eace71329939f7, which\ncontained an encrypted Zbot variant[3] at the beginning of the RTF. It looks very likely that this\nsample was used as a development template for the other malware writing groups.\n\n|Col1|Col2|\n|---|---|\n||Encrypted Zbot|\n|||\n||CVE-2012-0158 exploit and Zbot shellcode|\n|||\n\n|Col1|Col2|Col3|\n|---|---|---|\n|CVE-2014-1761 exploit and Zbot shellcode|||\n||||\n\n\n-----\n\n#### First attempt: Plugx\nThe first attempt must have come from the group deploying Plugx. They took the above\nmentioned sample, and made some modifications to it.\n\nThe result looks like this one:\n\nEncrypted Zbot\n\nCVE-2012-0158 exploit and Plugx shellcode\n\nCVE-2014-1761 exploit and Zbot shellcode\n\nEncrypted Plugx\n\nI can only guess that they didn’t understand the CVE-2014-1761 component, and thought that\nthere was only one shellcode, in the CVE-2012-0158 segment. So they appended the encrypted\nPlugx executable, and replaced the first shellcode with their own. This shellcode contains the\nhardcoded offset of the embedded executable, and decrypts from there.\n\nHowever, they left intact the encrypted Zbot executable at the beginning of the file and\nthe second vulnerability, making this sample a real dual weapon: not only that it exploits\ntwo vulnerabilities, but contains two totally different payloads. However, Word can only be\nexploited once: during the exploitation procedure the current instance of Word exits, and a new\none is started that displays the decoy document. So this creates a race condition: whichever\nvulnerability is triggered first (or gets lucky in an environment where the other one is patched)\nwill have the chance to run its own payload.\n\n_13effaca957cc362bdcbfdd05b5763205b53d9ca_\nOriginal name: N/A\n\nSystem activity\nDropped to C:\\Documents and Settings\\All Users\\DRM\\AShld\\drmupgds.exe (clean loader\ndigitally signed by Microsoft) and C:\\Documents and Settings\\All Users\\DRM\\AShld\\BlackBox.\nDLL (malware loader) and C:\\Documents and Settings\\All Users\\DRM\\AShld\\BlackBox.BOX\n(payload); registered in HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\BlackBox → ImagePath\n\nThe payload is next-generation Plugx,[4] plugin function creation dates are 0x20130810.\n\n\n-----\n\nC&C servers\nchromeupdate.authorizeddns.org\nDynamic DNS service\n\ngooglesupport.proxydns.com\nDynamic DNS service\n\n#### Template 2: Goldsun\nAt some point they must have realized that it was wrong and tried to fix the CVE-2014-1761 part.\nFor that, they took another recent sample, something similar to those that drop Goldsun Trojans\n(like this SHA1: e2474cc0da5a79af876771217eb81974e73c39e5)\n\nIn this case, the RTF only contains the CVE-2014-1761 vulnerability, with an appended\nexecutable. The vulnerability expects the second stage shellcode at a fixed file offset, checks a\nmarker string there (“p!11”), and jumps to the second stage, which then decrypts and executes\nthe final Win32 payload.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Second attempts\nA large group of samples were created by a sort of a fusion of the Zbot and the Goldsun\nsamples, resulting in a structure like this one:\n\n\nEncrypted Zbot\n\n\nSo now there are two different shellcodes. The first, from Plugx, reads the length of the\nembedded decoy document and Win32 payload from the end of the file, and using this info\nlocates and decrypts the appended payload. This shellcode identifies the host document by\nchecking if the last dword is the same as the dword before that rotated by 3. And the same\nholds for another two dwords before that. These dwords also store the length of the appended\nPE payload and decoy document lengths. This structure makes it possible to swap the payload\nwithout changing the exploit and shellcode part.\n\nThe shellcode from Goldsun executes the second stage code from a fixed offset.\n\n\n-----\n\nThere are a couple of problems with this implementation. First, the defunctional encrypted\nZbot remains in these files, with no purpose at all. But the real problem is with the Goldsun\nstyle CVE-2014-1761 block. It was snatched from the CVE-2014-1761 exploiting document,\nand pasted after the existing Zbot+CVE-2012-0158 combo. Clearly, the offset where the\nsecond stage code would be shifted with the different prepended content, but it never\nhappened. As a result, the CVE-2014-1761 exploitation doesn’t work, despite all the efforts\nof the malware authors.\n\nA couple of distinct malware groups were identified that use these schematics.\n\n#### Plugx\nAll of these samples are Plugx v2 samples.[4] Most of the time they use Russian related themes in\nthe decoy document.\n\n_21b3e540746816c85e5270a1b8bb58bf713ff5f5_\nOriginal name: N/A\n\nThe dropped decoy document doesn’t contain anything, it is only blank page.\n\nSystem activity\nDropped to C:\\Documents and Settings\\All Users\\DRM\\usta\\usha.exe (clean loader, digitally\nsigned by Kaspersky) and C:\\Documents and Settings\\All Users\\DRM\\usta\\ushata.dll (malware\nloader) and C:\\Documents and Settings\\All Users\\DRM\\usta\\ushata.dll.avp (payload); registered\nfor startup as a service in HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\usta → ImagePath\n\nThe payload is next generation Plugx,[4] plugin function creation dates are 0x20130810\n\nC&C servers\nwww.notebookhk.net\nRegistry Registrant ID: Registrant Postal Code: 796373\nRegistrant Name: lee stan Registrant Country: HK\nRegistrant Organization: lee stan Registrant Phone: +0.04375094543\nRegistrant Street: xianggangdiqu Registrant Fax: +0.04375094543\nRegistrant City: xianggangdiqu Registrant Email: stanlee@gmail.com\nRegistrant State: xianggang\n\n_80f965432ce872fc3592d9f907d5a4f66ab07f9c_\nOriginal name: **Справка от 16.09.2014.doc**\n\n\n-----\n\nSystem activity\nDropped to C:\\Documents and Settings\\All Users\\DRM\\AShld\\AShld.exe (clean loader, digitally\nsigned by McAfee) and C:\\Documents and Settings\\All Users\\DRM\\AShld\\AShldRes.DLL\n(malware loader) and C:\\Documents and Settings\\All Users\\DRM\\AShld\\AShldRes.DLL.asr\n(payload); registered for startup as a service in HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\\nAShld → ImagePath\n\nThe payload is next generation Plugx,[4] plugin function creation dates are 0x20130810.\n\nC&C servers\ndwm.dnsedc.com\nRegistry Registrant ID: Registrant Country: CN\nRegistrant Name: qiuping liu Registrant Phone: +86.1052810955\nRegistrant Organization: huajiyoutian Registrant Phone Ext:\nRegistrant Street: beijing Registrant Fax: +89.1052810955\nRegistrant City: Beijing Registrant Fax Ext:\nRegistrant State/Province: BJ Registrant Email: yuminga1@126.com\nRegistrant Postal Code: 100191\n\nTwo of the Plugx samples turned out to be very new developments.

The end\nof encrypted PE is truncated, and the CVE-2012-0158 code is replaced with the Plugx shellcode.\n\nInterestingly, there is another shellcode, which is starts with the same marker (“p!11”) as the\nGoldsun second stage code, but the execution logic is the same as the Plugx shellcode. However,\nthis shellcode just hangs in the air, no execution path leads to it. It is not clear, where these\nsamples fit in the development path, could be that after the failure to integrate CVE-2014-1761,\nthe corresponding part was simply ditched from the samples.\n\n\nEncrypted Zbot\n\n\n_6f845ef154a0b456afcf8b562a0387dabf4f5f85_\nOriginal name: Indian Cooking Recipe.doc\n\n\n-----\n\nSystem activity\nDropped to C:\\Documents and Settings\\All Users\\RasTls\\RasTls.exe (clean loader digitally\nsigned by Symantec), C:\\Documents and Settings\\All Users\\RasTls\\RasTls.dll (loader) and\nC:\\Documents and Settings\\All Users\\RasTls\\RasTls.dll.msc (payload); registered in HKLM\\\nSYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\RasTls → ImagePath\n\nThe payload is next generation Plugx,[4] plugin function creation dates are 0x20130524\n\nC&C servers\nsupercat.strangled.net\nFree domain sharing\n\n_a97827aef54e7969b9cbbec64d9ee81a835f2240_\nOriginal name: Calling Off India-Pak Talks.doc\n\n\n-----\n\nSystem activity\nDropped to C:\\Documents and Settings\\All Users\\RasTls\\RasTls.exe (clean loader digitally\nsigned by Symantec), C:\\Documents and Settings\\All Users\\RasTls\\RasTls.dll (loader) and\nC:\\Documents and Settings\\All Users\\RasTls\\RasTls.dll.msc (payload); registered in HKLM\\\nSYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\RasTls → ImagePath\n\nThe payload is next generation Plugx,[4] plugin function creation dates are 0x20130524\n\nC&C servers\nnusteachers.no-ip.org\nDynamic DNS service\n\n_e8a29bb90422fa6116563073725fa54169998325_\nOriginal name: Human Rights Violations of Tibet.doc\n\n\n-----\n\nSystem activity\nDropped to C:\\Documents and Settings\\All Users\\RasTls\\RasTls.exe (clean loader digitally\nsigned by Symantec), C:\\Documents and Settings\\All Users\\RasTls\\RasTls.dll (loader) and\nC:\\Documents and Settings\\All Users\\RasTls\\RasTls.dll.msc (payload); registered in HKLM\\\nSYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\RasTls → ImagePath\n\nThe payload is next generation Plugx,[4] plugin function creation dates are 0x20130524.\n\nC&C servers\nruchi.mysq1.net\nDynamic DNS service\n\n_19e9dfabdb9b10a90b62c12f205ff0d1eeef3f14_\nThis is not a Plugx sample, but a Nineblog variant.[8]\n\nOriginal name: ghozaresh amniyati.doc\n\nSystem activity\nDropped to %PROFILE%\\Application Data\\Erease.vbe, that connects to the C&C server.

Should it be considered as a\ncommon cybercrime sample (as the dropped Zbot suggests) or as an APT (as Plugx does)?\nActually, it depends on the patch level of the targeted computer.\n\nThe narrow line between APT and common malware shrank to zero with that sample. We have seen\nearlier[6] that authors of common malware are getting the idea of document-based exploitation\nfrom the APT players. Now it is swinging back – targeted attack players are snatching ideas from\nthe other group. The fact that the attempt was less successful does not deny the fact that a\nsymbiosis exists between the two distinct criminal groups, and ideas are floating in both directions.\n\n#### References:\n\n1. http://blog.malwaretracker.com/2013/06/tomato-garden-campaign-part-2-old-new.html\n\n2. http://www.securelist.com/en/analysis/204792298/The_\ncurious_case_of_a_CVE_2012_0158_exploit\n\n3. https://www.virustotal.com/en-gb/file/3ba00f684daf0f9f2c1bef093\n4f1af73c7dabd44a13070b64de34c0754110aa3/analysis/\n\n4. https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2014/06/30/from-the-labs-plugx-the-next-generation/\n\n5. http://blog.9bplus.com/watching-attackers-through-virustotal/\n\n6. https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2014/03/11/on-the-trail-of-advanced-persistent-threats/\n\n7. http://www.arcticadv.com/free/ebook/pdf/sdb-explorer-exe-black-hat.html\n\n8. http://www.fireeye.com/blog/technical/malware-research/2013/08/\nthe-curious-case-of-encoded-vb-scripts-apt-nineblog.html\n\n\nUnited Kingdom and Worldwide Sales\nTel: +44 (0)8447 671131\nEmail: sales@sophos.com\n\n\nNorth American Sales\nToll Free: 1-866-866-2802\nEmail: nasales@sophos.com\n\n\nAustralia and New Zealand Sales\nTel: +61 2 9409 9100\nEmail: sales@sophos.com.au\n\n\nAsia Sales\nTel: +65 62244168\nEmail: salesasia@sophos.com\n\n\nOxford, UK | Boston, USA\n© Copyright 2014.
