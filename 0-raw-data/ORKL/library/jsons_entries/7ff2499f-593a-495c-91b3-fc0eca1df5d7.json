    "plain_text": "# Appleseed Being Distributed to Nuclear Power Plant- Related Companies\n\n**asec.ahnlab.com/en/41015/**\n\nNovember 2, 2022\n\nThe ASEC analysis team has recently discovered a case of AppleSeed being distributed to\nnuclear power plant-related companies. AppleSeed is a backdoor malware used by Kimsuky,\none of the organizations affiliated with North Korea, and this malware is being actively\ndistributed to many companies.\n\n[AppleSeed Disguised as Purchase Order and Request Form Being Distributed](https://asec.ahnlab.com/en/36368/)\n\nThe filenames of the AppleSeed dropper were identified by the ASEC analysis team as\nfollows, and a double file extension was used to deceive users.\n\n노**.xls.vbs (Noh**.xls.vbs)\n배치도_고리2호기ISI.pdf.vbs (Layout_KoriNo2ISI.pdf.vbs)\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. AppleSeed dropper file\nWhen the file is executed, the encoded data inside is decoded and each file is created in the\npaths below.\n\n**[The same path as the vbs file]\\Noh**.xls (Normal Excel bait file)**\n**%ProgramData%\\qijWq.rSCKPC.b64 (Malicious PE file encoded in a certain**\n**format)**\n**%ProgramData%\\qijWq.rSCKPC.bat (Batch file that decodes the**\n**qijWq.rSCKPC.b64 file)**\n\nThe printed Excel file is automatically opened, making it seem as if the user has opened a\nnormal Excel document. The Excel bait file contains texts related to nuclear power plants\n(See Figure 2).\n\nFigure 2. Details of the bait file\nIn the background, the qijWq.rSCKPC.bat file in the %ProgramData% path is executed,\nwhich decodes qijWq.rSCKPC.b64, ultimately creating the qijWq.rSCKPC file (DLL PE).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3. Dropping malware\nAfterward, the dropped malware is executed via regsvr32, a program that executes DLL files.\nThe exact execution argument is as follows.\n\n**regsvr32 /s /i:123579ASDFG C:\\ProgramData\\qijWq.rSCKPC**\n\nAfter the file is executed, the malware accesses the C2 below to receive and carry out the\ncommands. Then, it encodes the results in a certain format to transmit to C2.\n\n**C2 : hxxp://ndt.info[.]gf/index.php**\n**Commands**\n\ndie: Terminate\ngetinfo: PC information\nwhere: Currently running path\nrun: Executes certain files or commands\n\nFigure 4. Information transmitted to\n\nthe server when the getinfo command is executed\nThe attacker can use the run command to execute desired behaviors, as well as download\nand execute additional malware files such as AppleSeed.\n\n\n-----\n\nBecause the bait file is also run, users normally cannot recognize that their systems are\ninfected by malware. As the files mentioned above mainly target certain companies, users\nshould refrain from running attachments in emails sent from unknown sources.\n\nAhnLab’s anti-malware software, V3, is currently detecting and blocking the files using the\nfollowing aliases.\n\nFigure 5. Detection using the V3 product\n\n**[File Detection]**\n\nDropper/VBS.Generic.SC183898\n\nDropper/Win.AppleSeed.R531012\n\nDropper/VBS.VBS\n\n**[IOC Info]**\n\n55a9a935b36da90fb5a7ab814d567a40\n\nba83312ea92c284c710bcc0906a29fb1\n\nhxxp://ndt.info[.]gf/index.php\n\n**Subscribe to AhnLab’s next-generation threat intelligence platform ‘AhnLab TIP’ to**\n**check related IOC and detailed analysis information.**\n\n[Categories:Malware Information](https://asec.ahnlab.com/en/category/malware-information-en/)\n\n[Tagged as:AppleSeed,](https://asec.ahnlab.com/tag/appleseed/) [Kimsuky,](https://asec.ahnlab.com/en/tag/kimsuky-en/) [malware](https://asec.ahnlab.com/en/tag/malware-en/)\n\n\n-----",
