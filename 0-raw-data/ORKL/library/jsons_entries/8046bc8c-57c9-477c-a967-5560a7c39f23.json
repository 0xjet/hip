Our\nfirst [blog on this new variant was devoted to a technical analysis of the samples that had](https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/death-ransom-new-strain-ransomware.html)\nbeen gathered. In this second part, we will try to shed a light on how this DeathRansom\ncampaign is connected with other campaigns, and who might be behind them.\n\n## False Scent and Connections with Vidar Stealer\n False Language Lead\n\nWe start our investigation with the sample\n13d263fb19d866bb929f45677a9dcbb683df5e1fa2e1b856fde905629366c5e1, which was\nmentioned in our previous blog. This sample has debug paths, but we could not recognize\nthe language used. In addition, it has nine resources, with a LANG_SLOVAK identifier\nconstant (0x041B) in the resource section. This means that the sample could have been\ncompiled on a machine with a Slovak language installed by default.\n\nFigure 1: A debug path inside the sample\n\nFigure 2. Part of the .rsrc section of the sample\n\nWe tried to translate a PDB path from Slovak by splitting the words in different ways and then\nfeeding the results to various automatic translation services. However, none of these\nattempts led to a correct translation. In fact, the word “duzuk” was recognized by Google\nTranslate not as Slovak, but as Basque (for the English “you have”).\n\n\n-----\n\nA Basque word was an intriguing lead, since this sample was downloaded from a domain in\nthe .es domain zone (Spain). We believe that this domain was hacked, therefore we will not\ndisclose the domain name here.\n\nThe name of the sample was also interesting: Wacatac_2019-11-20_00-10.exe. The word\n“Wacatac” can be translated from Basque in several different meaningful ways, so we\ndecided to dig deeper.\n\nSince the file name has a clearly distinguishable name-date-time construction, we decided to\nsearch for this pattern among all known files. Nine files were found. Their details are\nprovided in Figure 3.\n\nFigure 3. A part of our investigation table\n\nAgain, we were a little disappointed: the resource language ID’s were changed from Nepali\nto Slovak then to Neutral then back to Slovak at a very fast pace. In addition, the debug\npaths look like machine-generated gibberish rather than any paths a human programmer\nwould use.\n\nTherefore, we had to conclude that a Basque trace was just a coincidence. However, the\nSlovak and Nepali traces are not. Most probably, they were intentionally inserted to mislead\npotential investigators.\n\n## Bitbucket Profile\n\nIn spite of these disappointments, these new samples also gave us an important clue. One of\nthe samples shown on Figure 3 was downloaded not from the hacked .es site, but from a\ndifferent URL:\n\nhxxp://bitbucket[.]org/scat01/1/downloads/Wacatac_2019-11-16_14-06.exe\n\nThe link was not accessible, and neither was the scat01 profile itself:\n\nFigure 4. Bitbucket message shown on an access attempt to the scat01 profile\n\nNevertheless, when we searched for other malicious samples which attempted to access this\nBitbucket directory, we found an interesting connections log from May 2019. The sample was\nrelated to the Vidar stealer malware family.\n\nFigure 5. A part of a connections log for the Vidar sample\n\nThe name pattern has an obvious resemblance to our Wacatac sample:\n\n_Wacatac_2019-11-20_00-10.exe_\n\n_scat01_2019-05-20_06-13.exe_\n\n\n-----\n\nNext, we decided to search among the connections logs for a connection by the URL mask\n\n_bitbucket[.]org/scat01/*_\n\nOne of the connections logs found on VirusTotal is shown on Figure 6 (sample\ndc9ff5148e26023cf7b6fb69cd97d6a68f78bb111dbf39039f41ed05e16708e4).\n\nFigure 6. Contacted URL via a fresh malicious sample\n\nLet’s now analyze these connections. The connections shown in the green frame should be\nfamiliar to anyone who has dealt with Vidar stealers, as they are standard Vidar libraries\nused to extract passwords from different browsers.\n\nThe connection shown in the red frame is an attempt to access an executable file with\nanother Wacatac name. Unfortunately, this link was not accessible during the Vidar sample\nsandbox analysis, therefore we don’t have a Wacatac_2019-11-16_17-03.exe sample.\n\nNevertheless, as you may remember from our first blog, DeathRansom uses the name\n‘Wacatac’ to store crypto keys in a registry. Therefore, we have strong reason to believe that\nthe inaccessible Wacatac_2019-11-16_17-03.exe sample was another DeathRansom\nvariant.\n\nTherefore, based on the same “malware hosting”, the same name pattern, and the fact that\nthe Vidar sample tried to download a DeathRansom sample, we can conclude that the Vidar\ncampaign and the DeathRansom campaign are run by the same actor, who uses scat01 as a\nBitbucket profile name as well as a name for some malware samples.\n\nWe decided to dig deeper and see what could be found about this scat01.\n\n## Following scat01\n\nWe started to look for fresh malware containing the string scat01 in it. Here is a short\nsummary of our findings:\n\nOne of the samples we found was the “Azorult” stealer malware that connects to a C2\nserver “scat01[.]tk”.\na45a75582c4ad564b9726664318f0cccb1000005d573e594b49e95869ef25284\nWe also managed to find a C2 panel of “1ms0rryStealer” with the name scat01 in the\nBenkow “Panel Tracker” service:\n\nFigure 7. Archived record of the stealer control panel\n\n\n-----\n\nThe most important sample was found here:\n_hxxp://gameshack[.]ru/scat01.exe_\ne767706429351c9e639cfecaeb4cdca526889e4001fb0c25a832aec18e6d5e06\n\nThis sample is a non-obfuscated Evrial stealer. When we check its configuration, we\nsee the following “Owner” field:\n\nFigure 8. Malware owner field\n\nThe last sample was downloaded from a root folder of the website gameshack[.]ru. This\ncould mean that attackers somehow control this webserver. Therefore, we decided to see\nwhat else could be found on this webserver.\n\n## Gameshack[.]ru Portal\n\nWe found many malicious samples, which were downloaded directly from a root folder on\nGameshack[.]ru. We decided to analyze all available samples and extract any information\nthat could help us in our investigation.\n\nFigure 9. Malicious samples downloaded from “gameshack[.]ru” (according to VirusTotal)\n\nThe malware samples “hosted” on the gameshack[.]ru website were downloaders. This\nmeans that their purpose was to download a payload and run it. The main payload was of\ntwo types:\n\nEvrial stealer;\nMiner+Clipper+Stealer (Supreme miner).\n\nThe Evrial stealer samples were not obfuscated and contained the same “Owner” field –\n“scat01”.\n\nThe Supreme miner samples were obfuscated by “NULL SHIELD” (Confuser variant) and\nhad an e-mail embedded: vitasa01[@]yandex.ru.\n\nFigure 11 shows part of the strings from the miner “Supreme.exe” (sample\n1e1fcb1bcc88576318c37409441fd754577b008f4678414b60a25710e10d4251). This miner\nalso had the Evrial stealer inside its body:\n\nFigure 10. Strings from the miner’s part of the malware\n\nAs you can see, this sample uses the same iplogger service for counting the infected hosts\nas the DeathRansom samples (see our recent blogpost for details.)\n\nThe Evrial stealer inside has the same “scat01” ownership:\n\nFigure 11. Strings from the Evrial stealer’s part of the malware\n\n\n-----\n\nAs you can see, the website _gameshack[.]ru is controlled by attackers and they distribute_\nmalicious samples with scat01 attribution strings inside.\n\nHere is a short summary of the info about the attackers that we have found so far, including\nthe spread of malware families associated with them:\n\nDeathRansom\nVidar stealer\nAzorult stealer\nEvrial stealer\n1ms0rryStealer\nSupreme miner\n\nAs well as attribution info:\n\n**scat01 nickname;**\n**vitasa01[@]yandex.ru e-mail.**\nControl over gameshack[.]ru\n\nIt seems obvious that these attackers use a Russian email service and a Russian domain\nzone .ru. In addition, we must remember that DeathRansom performs a check for the system\nlanguage, and it will not encrypt files if it detects locales from an ex-USSR country.\n\nIn addition, when we analyze the stealers used by this group, we find that they can be\npurchased on Russian underground forums. Therefore, we decided to continue our search\nthere.\n\n## Russian Underground\n\nOnce we searched for “scat01” and “vidar” on the Russian underground forums, we found a\nperson with the same nickname providing a review (in Russian) of the Vidar stealer:\n\nFigure 12. Feedback for Vidar stealer left by scat01\n\nWe found another post left by scat01 on another forum. This time it concerns the Evrial\n**stealer. He is afraid that someone might access his logs from that Evrial stealer, as all the**\ninformation goes to the malware seller’s servers.\n\nFigure 13. Complaints of scat01 regarding Evrial stealer seller\n\nAnother post with a review was found on another Russian underground forum. This time the\nreview is for Supreme miner:\n\nFigure 14. Feedback for Supreme miner\n\n\n-----\n\nMoreover, a user with the same name was active on yet another Russian underground forum\n(from now on, we will refer to this underground forum as Russian underground forum #4).\nThe user is currently banned for having multiple accounts with different names. Please pay\nattention to the profile picture used here.\n\nFigure 15. Scat01 profile on the Russian underground forum #4\n\nNow, having found his/her profiles on the underground forums, we next extended our search,\ncomparing the information. One interesting piece we discovered is a product review on\nYandex.Market – the same company that provides the email service in the @yandex.ru\ndomain.\n\nFigure 16. Review for a purchase\n\nIn the review there is no text (only a score), but we can see its location. The review was\nmade from Aksay. Aksay is a small Russian town near Rostov-on-Don (we will come back\nto this clue a little later).\n\nFigure 17. Aksay on Google Maps\n\nAnother important clue here is the username of the reviewer account: vitasa01. Therefore, it\nis highly probable that this reviewer has access to the email vitasa01[@]yandex.ru, which we\nhave seen in previous malicious samples.\n\nFigure 18. Yandex username in the URL string\n\nAlso, please pay attention to the picture used in this profile. It is the same picture shown in\nFigure 15. Therefore, we have a triple match:\n\nthe profile picture\ncurrent username\nYandex username\n\nAt this point, we are pretty sure that this Yandex profile is related to the scat01 profile we\nfound on the Russian underground forum #4 as well as to the malware distributed from\ngameshack[.]ru. But how can we find the possible real identity of this author? We decided to\nsee what info we could find about gameshack[.]ru itself.\n\n## Gameshack[.]ru Portal\n\nWe found an interesting YouTube channel that promotes the website gameshack[.]ru. The\nlink to gameshack[.]ru is named: “our game portal.”\n\nFigure 19. YouTube channel advertising malicious website\n\n\n-----\n\nThe username given here is SoftEgorka. _Egorka is a diminutive for the Russian name_\n“Egor.” The avatar picture also refers to gameshack[.]ru.\n\nAnother interesting piece of information we found is a Skype link. In figure 20, you can see\nthat it refers to the skype username SoftEgorka:\n\nFigure 20. Skype link in the YouTube profile\n\nWhen we searched for a “SoftEgorka” skype user, we found the following user profile on the\nsame Russian underground forum #4. This time the username “Super info” is used.\n\nFigure 21. “Super info” profile on the Russian underground forum #4\n\nThe Skype address corresponds to the YouTube channel discussed above. The user states\nthat he lives in Italy. Moreover, searching further for his messages, we found another\nconfirmation that this could be true:\n\nFigure 22. The actor claims that he/she is from Italy\n\nBy digging further among Super Info posts, we found an announcement about game\naccounts sales (Steam, WoT, Origin). Here we should note that stealers observed above are\ncapable of stealing passwords from different games and game distribution platforms. This\nmore indirect evidence that Super Info may be connected to the ongoing stealers campaign.\n\nFigure 23. A message with a WebMoney ID and the known skype link inside\n\nIn the contacts section of the sale, you find “Skype: SoftEgorka” as well as the WebMoney ID\n**372443071304. This same WMID is mentioned in another post from the same user. It is also**\nrelated to Steam accounts for sale. And this time, another skype profile is mentioned:\n**nedugov99**\n\nFigure 24. A message with the same WMID and skype account nedugov99\n\nSearching again, this time for this new Skype ID, an old advertisement for the sale of a game\naccount shows up:\n\nFigure 25. Old advertisement of a game account for sale\n\nHere, we can see several important pieces of information:\n\nUser name: undefined_Nedugov\n\nThe skype id: nedugov99\n\nThe phone: +7951****311\n\nVkontakte SNS id: id154704666\n\n\n-----\n\nWe checked the mobile phone number and it belongs to the Rostov-on-Don region.\n\nNext, we checked out the VK id154704666 profile:\n\nFigure 26. Vkontakte SNS profile of Egor Nedugov\n\nThe name “Egor” corresponds to one of the underground nicknames, “SoftEgorka,” and the\nsurname “Nedugov” corresponds to the Skype account “nedugov99”. According to the\nprofile, this individual lives in Rostov-on-Don. Remember that the Yandex review made by\n_scat01 was done from Aksay – a small town near Rostov-on-Don._\n\nAnd even more interesting, he is following (or maybe even administrating?) the\n“Gameshack[.]ru official group”. The link to the same group is found in the YouTube profile\nshown in Figures 20-21.\n\nFigure 27. “Egor Nedugov” is following the malicious website VK group\n\nHere an astute reader might ask: “Rostov-on-Don? But what about Italy, mentioned in\nFigures 21-22?” To get an answer, we have to visit Egor’s Instagram page:\n\nFigure 28. Instagram account of Egor Nedugov\n\nAs we might learn from his Instagram and Facebook accounts, he indeed lived in Italy for\nsome time.\n\nThere is one more thing here. At this point in the investigation, we asked ourselves: “what if\n_scat01 and SoftEgorka are different actors? The former one compiles malware and the later_\none “hosts” it on Gameshack[.]ru portal?” Obviously, we have connections via\n_gameshack[.]ru and geographical connections, but what if they are friends and live in the_\nsame region?\n\nWell, we found yet another clue: the profile on csgo-stats[.]net is shown in Figure 29. The\nuser with the username scat01 names himself as Egor (Russian: Егор). We must note that\nthe name “Egor” is rare in Russia.\n\nFigure 29. Scat01 profile on csgo-stats[.]net\n\nWe also found many other profiles of the same actor. According to information on\nunderground forums, this person is responsible for account stealing, carding, malware\ndistribution, and even the phishing and scamming of his forum mates. That is why nearly all\nhis accounts on underground forums were eventually banned.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n\n-----\n\nFortiGuard Labs established a significant connection between the ongoing DeathRansom\nand Vidar malware campaigns. They share the naming pattern and infrastructure used. We\nalso found evidence that a Vidar sample tried to download the DeathRansom malware.\n\nWe believe that an actor with the nickname scat01 could be responsible for the latest\nDeathRansom attack, as well as other malicious attacks. We also found evidence of strong\nRussian roots in the malware being distributed.\n\nBased on the evidence left on Russian underground forums, we were able to find a person\nwho seems to likely be behind these malicious campaigns.\n\n## Solution\n\nAll samples mentioned in this article are detected by the FortiGuard antivirus engine:\n\n05b762354678004f8654e6da38122e6308adf3998ee956566b8f5d313dc0e029 W32/Kryptik.GYME!tr\n\n0cf124b2afc3010b72abdc2ad8d4114ff1423cce74776634db4ef6aaa08af915 W32/Kryptik.GYQI!tr\n\n13d263fb19d866bb929f45677a9dcbb683df5e1fa2e1b856fde905629366c5e1 W32/Kryptik.ANT!tr\n\n2b9c53b965c3621f1fa20e0ee9854115747047d136529b41872a10a511603df8 W32/GenKryptik.DYFO!tr\n\n4bc383a4daff74122b149238302c5892735282fa52cac25c9185347b07a8c94c W32/GenKryptik.DYBP!tr\n\n6247f283d916b1cf0c284f4c31ef659096536fe05b8b9d668edab1e1b9068762 W32/GenKryptik.DXWB!tr\n\n66ee3840a9722d3912b73e477d1a11fd0e5468769ba17e5e71873fd519e76def W32/Kryptik.GYMH!tr\n\ndc9ff5148e26023cf7b6fb69cd97d6a68f78bb111dbf39039f41ed05e16708e4 W32/GenKryptik.DXWQ!tr\n\nf78a743813ab1d4eee378990f3472628ed61532e899503cc9371423307de3d8b W32/GenKryptik.DXWH!tr\n\nfedb4c3b0e080fb86796189ccc77f99b04adb105d322bddd3abfca2d5c5d43c8 W32/Kryptik.GYQI!tr\n\na45a75582c4ad564b9726664318f0cccb1000005d573e594b49e95869ef25284 W32/Generic!tr.pws\n\ne767706429351c9e639cfecaeb4cdca526889e4001fb0c25a832aec18e6d5e06 MSIL/Agent.QJH!tr\n\n1e1fcb1bcc88576318c37409441fd754577b008f4678414b60a25710e10d4251 MSIL/CoinMiner.AHY!tr\n\nThe FortiGuard Web Filtering service blocks the following URLs as malicious:\n\n\n-----\n\niplogger[.]org/1Zqq77\nbitbucket[.]org/scat01/\nscat01.mcdir[.]ru\ngameshack[.]ru\nscat01[.]tk\n\n## IOC\n\n### SHA256:\n\n05b762354678004f8654e6da38122e6308adf3998ee956566b8f5d313dc0e029\n\n0cf124b2afc3010b72abdc2ad8d4114ff1423cce74776634db4ef6aaa08af915\n\n13d263fb19d866bb929f45677a9dcbb683df5e1fa2e1b856fde905629366c5e1\n\n2b9c53b965c3621f1fa20e0ee9854115747047d136529b41872a10a511603df8\n\n4bc383a4daff74122b149238302c5892735282fa52cac25c9185347b07a8c94c\n\n6247f283d916b1cf0c284f4c31ef659096536fe05b8b9d668edab1e1b9068762\n\n66ee3840a9722d3912b73e477d1a11fd0e5468769ba17e5e71873fd519e76def\n\ndc9ff5148e26023cf7b6fb69cd97d6a68f78bb111dbf39039f41ed05e16708e4\n\nf78a743813ab1d4eee378990f3472628ed61532e899503cc9371423307de3d8b\n\nfedb4c3b0e080fb86796189ccc77f99b04adb105d322bddd3abfca2d5c5d43c8\n\na45a75582c4ad564b9726664318f0cccb1000005d573e594b49e95869ef25284\n\ne767706429351c9e639cfecaeb4cdca526889e4001fb0c25a832aec18e6d5e06\n\n1e1fcb1bcc88576318c37409441fd754577b008f4678414b60a25710e10d4251\n\n### URL:\n\niplogger[.]org/1Zqq77\n\nbitbucket[.]org/scat01/\n\nscat01.mcdir[.]ru\n\ngameshack[.]ru\n\nscat01[.]tk\n\n_[Learn more about FortiGuard Labs and the FortiGuard Security Services portfolio.](https://www.fortinet.com/fortiguard/threat-intelligence/threat-research.html?utm_source=nreleaseblog&utm_campaign=2018-q2-fortiguardlabs-cta)_ _Sign_\n_up for our weekly FortiGuard Threat Brief._\n\n_[Read about the FortiGuard Security Rating Service, which provides security audits and best](https://www.fortinet.com/support-and-training/support-services/fortiguard-security-subscriptions/security-rating.html?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=2018-blog-security-rating-service)_\n_practices._\n\n### Related Posts\n\nCopyright © 2022 Fortinet, Inc.
