    "plain_text": "# Systematic cyber attacks against Israeli and\n Palestinian targets going on for a year\n\n### By Snorre Fagerland Principal Security Researcher\n\n© Norman AS, November 2012\n\n\n-----\n\n## Summary\nWe have observed multiple probable malware attacks against Israeli and Palestinian targets.\nThese attacks are likely performed by the same attacker, as the malware in question\ncommunicate with the same command- and control structures, and in many cases are signed\nusing the same digital certificate.\n\nThese attacks have been ongoing for at least a year; seemingly first focused on Palestinians,\nthen Israelis. The attacker is unknown at this point, but the purpose is assumed to be\nespionage/surveillance.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Introduction\n\nRecently, media (1) reported of a targeted attack against the Israeli government, in the form of\nemails purporting to come from IDF Chief of Staff Benny Gantz with a malicious attachment.\n\nThis was an interesting development – Israel has, as far as we know, not been very targeted by\nspear phishing attacks like this.\n\nIn the following text we will usually be referring to the actual malware files we uncovered by\ntheir MD5 hash, which is a number that uniquely (well, uniquely enough) identifies the file in\nquestion.\n\n\n-----\n\n## The initial reported malware\n\nWhile we don’t have visibility into Israeli government mails, we do receive a lot of suspicious\nexecutable files, and a little digging gives results. We found one file which matched the reports:\n\n_\"IDF strikes militants in Gaza Strip following rocket barrage.doc----------------------------------------------.scr\"._\n\nThis is an executable file, but the icon looks like a document icon, and the very long name makes\nthe *.scr extension hard to spot - particularly if the executable comes packaged in an archive, as\nwas reportedly the case here.\n\nThis executable itself is a WinRAR selfextracting (SFX) archive, which contains several other files:\n\n  - _Word.exe, an XtremeRat backdoor executable_\n\n  - _2.ico, an icon file_\n\n  - _barrage.doc, an innocent document containing pictures (above)_\n\nXtremeRat is a commercially available backdoor trojan which has been used in many attacks,\ntargeted and otherwise, over the years. It gained some notoriety in connection with attacks\nagainst Syrian activists; along with other off-the-shelf trojans such as BlackShades and\nDarkComet.\n\n\n-----\n\n## The digital signature\n\nAn interesting feature of this exact XtremeRat is that it is digitally signed – seemingly by\nMicrosoft:\n\nThe certificate chain ends in an untrusted (faked) root certificate; so it will not validate properly.\nNevertheless the certificate is useful for us, as it can be used to find related cases. All\ncertificates are issued with a serial number which normally is quite unique, as it is supposed to\nbe an identifier within the scope of its issuer. So, querying our databases for this particular\nfaked certificate returns a number of files which are probably the products of our Israel-hostile\nattacker.\n\nThese files were received in intervals through the fall and summer, going back to May 2012, and\nreveal more hints about targets. Several of them are self extracting archives containing extra\nfiles, such as documents, links and even video. The following pages display some of the bait\ninformation the new files contain.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n## Command & Control\n\nThe involved malwares connect to external hosts controlled by the attackers. These belong to\nvarious DynDNS services, and at the time of writing resolve to IP addresses located with hosting\nservices in the US.\n\n_Samples in yellow connecting to C&C hosts (green). All are digitally signed and connected_\n_through the blue certificate node in the middle._\n\nThis is where the trail could have ended. However, there are still clues to look at – for example,\nwhat other executables connect to these C&C hosts. This time, digging into our Malware\nAnalyzer G2 (MAG2) databases shows that there is more malware talking to this infrastructure,\nand these bots again connect to more C&C domains. These new malwares are also\npredominantly XtremeRats. However, they have been in circulation for a longer time – all the\n_way back to October 2011. I think it is logical to assume that all these have been part of a_\nmedium/large surveillance operation.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen updated with this information the plot now looks like this:\n\n_Same as previous illustration, where new unsigned samples are shown to be related through the_\n_usage of the same C&C infrastructure.Colours have changed – now the certificate is green, the_\n_C&C servers are yellow, the samples are blue, while IP addresses are purple. These IP addresses_\n_can be considered examples – they change regularly._\n\nSeveral of these domains appear to be hosted together. For example (at the time of writing):\n\n108.171.108.190 is pointed to by may2008.dyndns.info, menu.dyndns.biz, flashsoft.no-ip.biz,\n_monagameel.chickenkiller.com, powerhost.zapto.org_\n108.171.124.13 is pointed to by helpme.no-ip.biz, mjed10.no-ip.info\n69.80.101.244 is pointed to by good.zapto.org, hint.zapto.org, hint1.zapto.org, natco1.no-ip.net,\n_natco2.no-ip.net, natco3.no-ip.net, natco4.no-ip.net, loading.myftp.org, skype.servemp3.com,_\n_test.cable-modem.org_\n\nThese addresses tend to change. Typically, every couple of days a new IP configuration is\nintroduced for some boxes, while others may remain static – such as the host lokia.mine.nu,\nwhich has resolved to 69.80.107.129 since we started examining the case.\n\nAs mentioned, the IP addresses in use have belonged to mostly US-based hosting services…at\nleast recently.\n\n\n-----\n\nIf we go further back in time (towards spring of 2012) most of the domains used resolved to IP\naddresses in the range 188.161.*. This range is located in Gaza and belongs to a provider\nheadquartered in Ramallah in the West Bank:\n\n**Palestinian Territory, Occupied Gaza Palestine Telecommunications Company (paltel), ASN:**\n**AS12975**\n\nWe have also to a lesser extent seen IP addresses in use belonging to another Paltel division:\n**Palestinian Territory, Occupied Gaza Hadara Technologies Private Shareholding Company,**\n**ASN: AS15975**\n\nWhat is behind these IP addresses is hard to establish. It is possible that they are hacked boxes,\nand as such not give much valid information. If that were the case, one might have expected\ngreater IP range and geographical distribution, but nothing is certain.\n\nOur databases also show that there is much more malware talking to these providers through\nmany other DynDNS domains. Some of these are probably also related to this case, but as we\nhave no evidence linking the cases, these malwares have not been included in this paper. It is\nhowever interesting to note the hostnames some of these connect to – like “terroristttt.noip.biz”.\n\n\n-----\n\n## The plot thickens\nSo far, the impression is of an attack actor attempting to gather information from Israelis. Then\nsomething happens that throws this picture in disarray.\n\nA series of samples show up that do not follow the pattern. They apparently do not target\nIsraelis. Instead they use Arabic language and refer to Palestinian issues.\n\n**Word document contained in EXE file**\n**FC17F3B2E2C7F5F24D35899D95B8C4A6**\n\nThis document in Arabic claims that Mahmoud Abbas is threatened by assassination by Mossad\nif he does not stop his reconciliation policy towards Hamas. The image is taken from a news\nstory about Abbas speaking at a meeting in Ramallah.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe sample containing this video is digitally signed in the same way as the initial samples, but\nthe baiting angle is different. Instead of showing information interesting for an Israeli audience,\nthe video contains a music piece critical of Mahmoud Abbas, claiming that he is not working for\nthe good of the Palestinian people.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis document revolves around the prisoner exchange deal with the Israeli government over the\nIsraeli soldier Gilad Shalit, held hostage by Hamas for over five years.\n\n**JPEG image contained in EXE file**\n**0AA7B256D2DCC8BD3914F895B134B225**\n\nThis image appears purportedly to be of Gilad Shalit in his hostage cell. This could be aimed at\nIsraelis, but the image itself has been mostly shown on Arabic/Palestinian sites like\n_www.shehab.ps, a news agency located in Gaza._\n\n\n-----\n\nThis document is an interview with the former Palestinian ambassador and Member of\nParliament Nabil Amr. He is known to have been critical of Arafat and later Abbas.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe also see attacks apparently against Palestinian targets without being able to tie them up\nagainst the already mentioned attack/C&C structure. For example, a file received by us as\n“d.exe”, (MD5 1f1e9958440d773c34415d9eb6334b25), found in Palestine Nov 17[th] last year,\nshows a PDF document with content seemingly taken from “Palestine Now”\n(www.paltimes.net):\n\n\n-----\n\n## Document metadata\nMost of the bait attachments are Word documents, and Word documents can contain metadata\n(typically the usernames of the creator and the one who last saved the document). It is possible\nto scrub these details, but our attackers seem to have forgotten this – or inserted faked data.\n\n**Palestinian baits:**\n_Hmas.doc:_ _Created by “Hitham”, saved by “anar”_ _date Oct 12[th] 2011_\n_484hhh.doc:_ _Created by “Hitham”, saved by “Ayman”_ _date Nov 27[th] 2011_\n_Word.doc:_ _Created and saved by “Tohan”_ _date Feb 18[th] 2012_\n\n**Israeli baits:**\n_word.doc:_ _Created by “ahmed”, saved by “aert”_ _date May 14[th] 2012_\n_IDF NEWS.doc:_ _Created and saved by “aert”_ _date May 26[th] 2012_\n_Brotherhood.doc:_ _Created and saved by “aert”_ _date Jun 24[th] 2012_\n_detl.doc:_ _Created and saved by “aert”_ _date Jun 29[th] 2012_\n_Advisor.doc:_ _Created and saved by “HinT”_ _date Jul 29[th] 2012_\n_IDF.doc:_ _Created and saved by “aert”_ _date Aug 1[st] 2012_\n_System.doc:_ _Created and saved by “HinT”_ _date Aug 5[th] 2012_\n_York.doc:_ _Created and saved by “HinT”_ _date Oct 16[th] 2012_\n_barrage.doc :_ _Created and saved by “HinT”_ _date Oct 24[th] 2012_\n_shehab.doc:_ _Created and saved by “HinT”_ _date Oct 31[st] 2012_\n\nThere seems to be a number of people involved in creating these bait files. The dates also\nroughly coincide with the apparent shift in IP ranges (Appendix B), from first being located in\nGaza, to being located internationally.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusion\nWe have uncovered a substantial number of malware executables that contain information\nseemingly tailored at Israelis and Palestinians. We have the impression that a cybersurveillance\noperation is underway (and is probably still ongoing - most recent sample created Oct. 31)\nwhich was first mainly focused on Palestinian targets, then shifted towards Israel. The reason\nfor the shift is unknown. Maybe it was planned all along; or caused by changes in the political\nclimate; or maybe the first half of the operation found data that caused the target change.\n\nThis analysis is almost exclusively based on the executable files themselves. We have very little\ninformation about actual infections. The only documented case is the Benny Gantz-themed\nemail which triggered the investigation. We consider it likely that other attacks have been\nmodeled the same way, using attachments in email. These attachments may often have\nconsisted of the described malicious files inside archives like RAR or ZIP.\n\nThe attacker is still unknown to us. There are probably several actors that could have an interest\nin the regional politics, as the various powerblocks in the region are manifold and conflicted. By\nusing largely off-the-shelf malware, the cost of mounting such an operation is considerably\nlower than for those who do their own malware development.\n\n\n-----\n\n## References\n\n1.
