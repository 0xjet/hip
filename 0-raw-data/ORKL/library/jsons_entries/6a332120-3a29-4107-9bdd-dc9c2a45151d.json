In this blog post we’re going to examine some\nmalicious infrastructure that we’ve found by pivoting through domains delivering and communicating with RATs.\n\nA RAT is malware that creates a back door to gain access to the target and its connected resources in order to spy/steal information, drop\nadditional malware such as ransomware, or to enlist the target into a botnet for DDoS purposes. A RAT can basically give all of the same\naccess to a system that the attacker would have if they were physically accessing the target. A RAT has many functionalities: remote desktop\ncontrol, webcam and microphone control, keylogger, remote shell, crypto miner, download and execute functionalities, screen capturing.\n\n## Purchase and Preparation\n\nWhen deciding on which RAT to setup and spread, there is a choice between free or paid varieties. There are RATs that are free to use and\nRATs that require one to pay for a license. They vary in their ease of setup and stability. Since these RATs have been available for years and\nare detectable through signatures, a “crypter” is used on the malware before deployment. Crypters are tools that can use encryption and\nobfuscation on the malware in an effort to make them FUD (Fully UnDetectable) against known pattern based or behavior based signatures\nused in Anti-Virus or IDS/IPS systems. When a low detection rate is reached they have a better chance of infecting targets. The goal is to\nappear to be a harmless program. Once crypted, criminals run the file through underground scan services that will tell them their file’s\nachieved detection rate.\n\nThe ease of setup and availability of these RATs have helped them remain a threat. There are also rental services, offering to do all of the\nsetup needed to build the infrastructure for RATs and bots, and then rent the use of them for a price.\n\n\n-----\n\nAdvertisement for RAT and Botnet Setup Services\n\n\nAdvertisement for RAT and Botnet Setup Services\nLuminosityLink is widely considered by some cyber criminals to be one of the best RATs.
