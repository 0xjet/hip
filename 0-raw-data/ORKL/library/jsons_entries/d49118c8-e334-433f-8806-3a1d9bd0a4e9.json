    "plain_text": "# eSentire Threat Intelligence Malware Analysis: HermeticWiper & PartyTicket\n\n**esentire.com/blog/esentire-threat-intelligence-malware-analysis-hermeticwiper-partyticket**\n\nRecently, there have been multiple reports of new wiper malware observed targeting Ukrainian organizations as part of cyber warfare\nstemming from the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict. This new wiper malware, also known as HermeticWiper, was first detected in February\n2022, and was deployed after a wave of multiple Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks launched by Russian threat actors against\nUkrainian law enforcement and government agencies.\n\neSentire’s Threat Intelligence team has performed a technical malware analysis on HermeticWiper and PartyTicket. This technical analysis\nprovides a detailed breakdown of how HermeticWiper fulfills its objective of accessing the Physical Drives and encrypting the targeted filetypes\nin the host device and network.\n\nWith the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, it’s probable that threat actors from Russia and Ukraine will leverage new malware in the ongoing\nhybrid war and improve their malware development capabilities to evade detections.\n\n## Key Takeaways:\n\nHermeticWiper malware is more sophisticated than WhisperGate in terms of implementing third-party drivers to facilitate access to the\nPhysical Drives as well as modifying its access token to enable interaction with the kernel.\nHermeticWiper is abusing legitimate EaseUS partition management drivers to retrieve partition information and destroy data. This shows\ndevelopment maturity compared to WhisperGate.\nThe main purpose of the decoy ransomware (PartyTicket, also known as HermeticRansom) is to limit the victim’s interactions with the\ninfected system.\nDue to the poor implementation of the encryption algorithm or the coding error, PartyTicket cannot be considered as a sophisticated\ndecoy ransomware, but it certainly made more improvements compared to WhisperGate.\nThe threat actor(s) behind HermeticWiper prevented the possibility of recovery by deleting shadow copies. It’s probable that this was\ndone to clear logs to avoid detection and attribution.\nAs a result of this research, we have created an additional 5 detections to reduce the risk of this threat and are performing global threat\nhunts for indicators associated with HermeticWiper & Party Ticket malware.\n\n## Case Study\n\n[The destructive malware dubbed as ‘HermeticWiper’ by SentinelLabs was first detected by researchers at ESET on February 23, 2022, atrd](https://twitter.com/ESETresearch/status/1496581903205511181?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1496581903205511181%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.welivesecurity.com%2F2022%2F02%2F24%2Fhermeticwiper-new-data-wiping-malware-hits-ukraine%2F)\n10am EST. Five hours later, the Cyber Police of Ukraine reported DDoS attacks on several Ukrainian government agencies, including Cabinet\nof Ministers of Ukraine, Verkhovna Rada (unicameral parliament of Ukraine), Security Service of Ukraine, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and other\nUkrainian government organizations.\n\n\n-----\n\ne epo ts stated t at t e oS attac s ad bee o go g s ce eb ua y 5 a d ed t e attac s, c ud g u e ous p s g atte pts,\nto Russian threat actors. As part of these attacks, HermeticWiper was installed on hundreds of machines in Ukraine, but evidence of\nHermeticWiper was also found in Lithuania and Latvia.\n\n[On February 27 Ukrainian border control was reported to be infected with HermeticWiper, which prevented refugees from being able to crossth](https://venturebeat.com/2022/02/27/ukraine-border-control-hit-with-wiper-cyberattack-slowing-refugee-crossing/)\ninto Romania. Symantec also reported that the ransomware named PartyTicket was dropped on the compromised machines.\n\n## Initial Compromise\n\n[On February 24-25 researchers at Symantec reported three potential initial vectors of compromise:th](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/ukraine-wiper-malware-russia)\n\n1. Ukraine, December 23, 2021 – The abuse of SMB on Microsoft Exchange Servers followed by credential stealing and web shell.\n2. Lithuania, November 12, 2021 – Tomcat exploitation followed by the creation of scheduled tasks to gain persistence on the compromised\n\nsystem.\n[3. Ukraine, November 11, 2021 – An exploit abusing Microsoft SQL Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability (CVE-2021-1636).](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-1636)\n\n## Technical Analysis on HermeticWiper\n\n**SHA-256: 0385eeab00e946a302b24a91dea4187c1210597b8e17cd9e2230450f5ece21da**\n\nHermeticWiper is a 32-bit executable written in C++ and at 114 KB, it’s over four times bigger than its predecessor, WhisperGate (27 KB).\nWhisperGate was also used as a decoy ransomware and destructive malware in January 2022 to target Ukrainian organizations. The compiler\ntimestamp dates to December 28, 2021. However, it should be noted that the timestamp can be easily modified by the threat actors. The\nmalware sample was signed by Hermetica Digital Ltd, a Cyprus-based company, and is valid from April 12, 2021 until April 14, 2022 (Exhibit\n1). Based on this discovery, eSentire’s Threat Intelligence team has determined it’s probable that the malware was developed in April 2021.\n\n_Exhibit 1: HermeticWiper digital signature_\n\nThe [RCDATA resource (the raw data resource of an application) contains 4 drivers: DRV_X64, DRV_X86, DRV_XP_X64, DRV_XP_X86. The](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/menurc/rcdata-resource)\ndrivers are compressed with SZDD (Haruhiko Okumura's LZSS), a compression algorithm known to be used by Microsoft installation programs\n(Exhibit 2).\n\n_Exhibit 2: HermeticWiper Resources_\n\nThe decompressed drivers are signed by Chengdu YIWO Tech Development Co Ltd, the developer of EaseUS (Exhibit 3).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Exhibit 3: Digital Certificate of the extracted drivers_\n\nThe implementation of EaseUS partition management driver in the wiper to access the file systems shows an improvement compared to\nWhisperGate. The drivers contain the program database (PDB) path, which contains debugging information, to:\n_d:\\epm\\_epm_main\\mod.windiskaccessdriver\\windiskaccessdriver\\objfre_wlh_x86\\i386\\epmntdrv.pdb_\n\nThis indicates that the attackers abused the legitimate driver epmntdrv.sys developed by EaseUS to facilitate access to the physical drives of\nthe victim’s machine.\n\nThe wiper will choose which driver to plant on the victim’s machine based on the Windows version, which uses major and minor conventions\nfor its Operating Systems (OS). If the major and minor versions of the OS is greater or equal to 6 and 0 respectively, it will assign the\n**DRV_X64, DRV_X86 drivers to it. Otherwise, it will assign DRV_XP_X64, DRV_XP_X86 drivers (Exhibit 4).**\n\n[Please refer to the chart compiled by Microsoft that contains operating system version information for more information.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/sysinfo/operating-system-version)\n\n_Exhibit 4: Assigning drivers to the appropriate OS_\n\nThe wiper then assigns itself the following privileges:\n\n**SeLoadDriverPrivilege – enables the user to unload and load device drivers in kernel mode. In our case, this will allow the threat actor**\nto load the EaseUS drivers used to corrupt and destroy data.\n**SeBackupPrivilege – provides an attacker with the ability to create system backups and full read permissions without further escalating**\nthe privileges.\n\nA service named after the dropped system driver will be created by the wiper via the CreateServiceW API, which will point to\n_C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\rhdr.sys (Note that the driver’s name will be randomly created with 4 characters). After the service has_\nsuccessfully started, it will sleep for 1000 milliseconds (about 1 second) and then be marked for deletion, at which point the user cannot\nmanually delete or stop it.\n\n**EPMNTDRV will be pointed to the path of the dropped system driver (Exhibit 5), and will also be used to retrieve the Physical Drive number via**\n[DeviceIoControl API (used to get information about the drive).](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/devio/calling-deviceiocontrol)\n\n_Exhibit 5: EPMTDRV pointing to the dropped driver_\n\nHermeticWiper initiates a loop that enumerates the Physical Drives to 100, in contrast to WhisperGate’s loop which is repeated up to 199 times\n(Exhibit 6). For every enumerated Physical Drive, the wiper will overwrite the first section of the master boot record (MBR) with 512 bytes,\nmaking the machine unbootable upon manual restart.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Exhibit 6: Drive Enumeration_\n\nIn addition to the drive enumeration, the wiper also looks for the following folders:\n\nDesktop\nMy Documents\nAppData\nC:\\Documents and Settings\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\winevt\\Logs\nWindows\nProgram Files\nProgram Files(x86)\nPerfLogs\nBoot\nSystem Volume Information\nAppData\n\nBoot and System Volume Information are two important folders that are responsible for Windows operability. Boot folder stores the Boot\nConfiguration Data (BCD) which contains information about the OS and boot parameters. Without the BCD file, Windows will not be able to\nboot. The System Volume Information folder is utilized by the System Restore tool to store the restore points.\n\nThe purpose of enumerating the above folders is unclear. It is notable that the threat actors crafted the malware to make sure all the folders\nand logs are wiped, and that the victim’s machine remains inoperable if the MBR wiping goes wrong. We believe it’s probable that this was\ndone to clear logs to avoid detection and attribution.\n\nNext, the crash dump logging is disabled by setting the registry value CrashDumpEnabled to 0 (Exhibit 7).\n\n_Exhibit 7: Disabling crash dump by setting the registry key to 0_\n\nThe Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) is also disabled via ChangeServiceConfigW API (the API allows to change the service\nconfigurations) through the SERVICE_DISABLED parameter (Exhibit 8).\n\n_Exhibit 8: Disabling Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS)_\n\n[The sample also queries for NTFS attribute types and metadata:](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-fscc/a82e9105-2405-4e37-b2c3-28c773902d85#:~:text=On%20a%20NTFS%20volume%2C%20each,exist%20on%20a%20NTFS%20volume.)\n\n\n-----\n\n$\n$I30\n$INDEX_ALLOCATION\n$Bitmap (Keeps track of cluster allocation on NTFS volume)\n$Logfile (Logs all changes to the file system)\n\nOther attributes such as $REPARSE_POINT and $LOGGED_UTILITY_STREAM were also found in the .rdata section but were never\nreferenced by anything. The partition corruption is dependent on whether the system has NTFS or FAT partitions (Exhibit 9).\n\n_Exhibit 9: Different partition corruption capabilities based on NTFS and FAT_\n\n## Technical Analysis of PartyTicket\n\n**SHA-256: 4dc13bb83a16d4ff9865a51b3e4d24112327c526c1392e14d56f20d6f4eaf382**\n\nThe ransomware sample is a 64-bit binary written in Golang with a size of 3.14 MB and an empty compilation timestamp. The following\nsections in the sample are responsible for determining the filetypes to encrypt, which directories to skip, drive letters to enumerate (Exhibit 10).\n\n_Exhibit 10: Sections mentioning “Biden”_\n\nAs mentioned previously, the function at _C__projects_403forBiden_wHiteHousE_baggageGatherings is enumerating through the drive\nletters from A to Z (Exhibit 11).\n\n_Exhibit 11: Drive letter enumeration_\n\nThe function at __C__projects_403forBiden_wHiteHousE_init checks if the OS supports AVX (Advanced Vector Extensions that are\nsupposed by Windows 7 SP1 and later) and is also responsible for folder and file manipulations as well as getting the time zone data.\n\nThe function at _C__projects_403forBiden_wHiteHousE_FileName gets up 55 file extensions and converts them to lower strings (Exhibit\n12).\n\n_Exhibit 12: Retrieving file extensions_\n\n\n-----\n\npp o ate y 5 e e te s o s get et e ed o e o y o u t e e c ypt o, ot c ud g t e e c ypted e e te s o, c yptedjb\n(Exhibit 13).\n\n_Exhibit 13: Populating the extensions from memory_\n\n.docx .doc .odt .pdf .xls .xlsx .rtf\n\n.ppt .pptx .one .xps .pub .vsd .txt\n\n.jpg .jpeg .bmp .ico .png .gif .sql\n\n.xml .pgsql .zip .rar .exe .msi .vdif\n\n.ova .avi .dip .epub .iso .sfx .inc\n\n.contact .url .mp3 .wmv .wma .wtv .avi\n\n.acl .cfg .chm .crt .css .dat .dll\n\n.cab .htm .html\n\nDuring the encryption process, the sample writes a ransomware note called “read_me.html” to the victim’s Desktop containing the contact\ninformation (Exhibit 14-15).\n\n_Exhibit 14: Creating read_me.html ransomware note_\n\n_Exhibit 15: Ransomware note (read_me.html)_\n\nThe ransomware implements AES-GCM encryption for the files (Exhibit 16). An RSA public key is also used to encrypt the AES key, which is\nbase64-encoded and embedded in the encrypted file. Here is the decoded RSA-OAEP public key with exponent 65537:\n\n|.docx|.doc|.odt|.pdf|.xls|.xlsx|.rtf|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|.ppt|.pptx|.one|.xps|.pub|.vsd|.txt|\n|.jpg|.jpeg|.bmp|.ico|.png|.gif|.sql|\n|.xml|.pgsql|.zip|.rar|.exe|.msi|.vdif|\n|.ova|.avi|.dip|.epub|.iso|.sfx|.inc|\n|.contact|.url|.mp3|.wmv|.wma|.wtv|.avi|\n|.acl|.cfg|.chm|.crt|.css|.dat|.dll|\n|.cab|.htm|.html|||||\n\n\n-----\n\n{ 5 5053856 58 5883 0 503 50 0 5 0059 08 50 33 90 03500 39 30 3 0 093993 8 608 09800 0 065660 538 5\n\n_Exhibit 16: AES-GCM encryption_\n\n[The AES key is created with math/rand, which produces a pseudorandom (inevitably, deterministic) sequence of values. That means that the](https://pkg.go.dev/math/rand)\nkey can be easily obtained to decrypt the files. During the analysis, we observed the same AES 16-bit key being used to encrypt the file,\n_“6FBBD7P95OE8UT5QRTTEBIWAR88S74DO”, because the same seed value is being used in the code (Exhibit 17)._\n\n[All encrypted file names will have the following extension: “.[[email protected]].encryptedJB” and each encrypted file will contain the marker](https://www.esentire.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)\n_“ZVL2KH87ORH3OB1J1PO2SBHWJSNFSB4A” at the end._\n\n_Exhibit 17: AES key creation using math/rand_\n\nDuring the encryption process, the main executable creates duplicates of itself in the working directory. Each duplicate is named with a GUID\nin the format “xxxxxxxx-11ec-xxx-000c29xxxxxx.exe” (Exhibit 18) and will copy itself using the same pattern with a command “cmd /c copy\n_C:\\workdir\\xxxxxxxx-xxxx-11ec-xxxx-000c29xxxxxx.exe xxxxxxxx-xxxx-11ec-xxxx-000c29xxxxxx.exe (Exhibit 19)._\n\nThe duplicated binaries are responsible for encrypting each file on the system, which significantly slows down the infected system. After the\nencryption, the binaries are removed from the directory, leaving only 200-300 copies. The encryption process can be easily stopped by\nterminating the process tree.\n\n_Exhibit 18: Duplicated binaries in the working directory_\n\n_Exhibit 19: Duplication process_\n\n\n-----\n\n## Comparing HermeticWiper, and PartyTicket to WhisperGate\n\nFrom the technical analysis, we have derived that HermeticWiper is more sophisticated than WhisperGate in terms of implementing third-party\ndrivers to facilitate access to the Physical Drives and modify its access token to enable interaction with the kernel. Moreover, the threat actor(s)\nbehind HermeticWiper prevented the possibility of recovery by deleting shadow copies. Although the purpose of enumerating the critical parts\nof the OS is still not clear, we believe it’s probable that this was done to clear logs to avoid detection and attribution.\n\nAs mentioned previously, PartyTicket has been observed on machines infected with HermeticWiper. The technical analysis of PartyTicket\nindicates that the threat actor(s) implemented AES-GCM encryption along with RSA public key for the targeted file extensions, making the\nattack look almost like an actual ransomware attempt, whereas WhisperGate decoy ransomware only overwrote the targeted files with 0xCC\nbytes and corrupted MBR by overwriting it with a fake ransom note.\n\nPartyTicket, the decoy ransomware, contains political messages based on the strings found mentioning “Biden” and a ransom note saying,\n“The only thing that we learned from new elections is we learned nothing from the old!”\n\nHermeticWiper samples have different hashes but the same functionality. WhisperGate has only one known reported hash for the wiper\nsample, which likely means that HermeticWiper was able to spread across more machines than WhisperGate.\n\nWith the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, it’s probable that threat actors from Russia and Ukraine will leverage new malware and that threat\nactors will likely improve their malware development capabilities to evade detection.\n\n## How eSentire is Responding\n\nOur Threat Response Unit (TRU) combines intelligence gleaned from research, security incidents, and the external threat landscape to create\nactionable outcomes for our customers. We are taking a holistic response approach to combat modern ransomware by deploying\ncountermeasures, such as:\n\nDeveloping threat detections to identify the initial and post-compromise activities of HermeticWiper and PartyTicket (HermeticRansom)\nand ensure these detections are in place across both eSentire MDR for Endpoint and MDR for Log.\nPerforming global threat hunts for indicators associated with HermeticWiper and Party Ticket malware.\n\nOur detection content is backed by investigation runbooks, ensuring our SOC cyber analysts respond rapidly to any intrusion attempt tied to\nknown ransomware tactics, techniques, and procedures. In addition, our Threat Response Unit closely monitors the ransomware threat\nlandscape and addresses capability gaps and conducts retroactive threat hunts to assess customer impact.\n\n## Recommendations from eSentire’s Threat Response Unit (TRU)\n\nWe recommend implementing the following controls to help secure your organization against the HermeticWiper, and PartyTicket malware:\n\nEnsure that Microsoft Exchange and Apache Tomcat servers are patched and up to date. Specifically ensuring your organization has\npatched:\n\nCVE-2020-0688 – Microsoft Exchange\nCVE-2021-26855 – Microsoft Exchange\nCVE-2021-26857 – Microsoft Exchange\nCVE-2021-26858 – Microsoft Exchange\nCVE-2021-27065 – Microsoft Exchange\nPatch any external-facing applications and devices on an ongoing basis. Conduct regular vulnerability scans to ensure your team is\nstaying on top of identifying, and patching, all known vulnerabilities.\n[Consider implementing a comprehensive vulnerability management program that includes continuous awareness of the threat landscape,](https://www.esentire.com/what-we-do/managed-vulnerability-and-risk/managed-vulnerability-service)\nvulnerability scanning to understand which systems are inadvertently exposed, and disciplined patch management.\nEnsure your team is enforcing strong password policies for all employees as part of strengthening your organization’s overall cyber\nhygiene.\n\nWhile the Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) used by adversaries grow in sophistication, they lead to a limited set of choke points at\nwhich critical business decisions must be made.
