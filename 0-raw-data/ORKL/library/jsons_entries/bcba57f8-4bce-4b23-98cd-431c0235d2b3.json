The botnet, the world’s first to communicate via a](https://labs.bitdefender.com/2018/01/new-hide-n-seek-iot-botnet-using-custom-built-peer-to-peer-communication-spotted-in-the-wild/)\ncustom-built peer to peer protocol, has now also become the first to gain persistence (the\nability to survive a reboot) with the new version.\n\nHistorically, the botnet infected close to 90,000 unique devices from the time of discovery\nuntil today, with ups and downs on each update.\n\nThe new samples identified in late April don’t add functionality, but feature plenty of\nimprovements on the propagation side. For instance, the new binaries now include code to\n[leverage two new vulnerabilities (more about this here and](http://www.wanda25.de/wansview_ncs601w.html) [here) to allow the malware to](https://vuldb.com/?id.92536)\ncompromise more IPTV camera models. In addition to the vulnerabilities, the bot can also\nidentify two new types of devices and pass their default username and passwords.\n\n**Generic attack avenues**\n\nThe sample discovered also targets several generic devices. Infected victims scan for\nneighbouring peers for the presence of the telnet service. As soon as the telnet service is\nfound, the infected device attempts to bruteforce acces. If the login succeds, the malware\nrestricts access to port 23 to potentially prevent a competing bot from hijacking the device.\n\nThis attack avenue targets a wide range of devices and architecture. Our research shows\nthat the bot has 10 different binaries compiled for various platforms, including x86, x64,\nARM (Little Endian and Big Endian), SuperH, PPC and so on.\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce the infection has been performed successfully, the malware copies itself in the\n**/etc/init.d/ and adds itself to start with the operating system. In order to achieve persistence,**\nthe infection must take place via Telnet, as root privileges are required to copy the binary to\nthe init.d directory.\n\nIt subsequently opens a random UDP port that is propagated to the neighboring bots. This\nport will be used by the cyber-criminals to get in touch with the device.\n\nThe supported command list has not changed significantly from the previous version of the\nbot. There is still no support for DDoS attacks (one of the most frequently encountered\nfeatures of IoT bots), which leaves extremely little room for monetizing the botnet. However,\n[the bot itself can still exfiltrate files using the method described in our last post about HnS.](https://labs.bitdefender.com/2018/01/new-hide-n-seek-iot-botnet-using-custom-built-peer-to-peer-communication-spotted-in-the-wild/)\n\nBased on the evidence at hand, we presume that this botnet is in the growth phase, as\noperators are trying to seize as many devices as possible before adding weaponized\nfeatures to the binary.\n\nThe samples we used for this piece of research are identified as\n**9ef7ed8af988d61b18e1f4d8c530249a1ce76d69 and**\n**c6d6df5a69639ba67762ca500327a35b0e3950b0.**\n\n**TAGS**\n\n[anti-malware research](http://10.10.0.46/blog/labs/tag/antimalware-research/)\n\n**AUTHOR**\n\n## Bogdan BOTEZATU\n\nInformation security professional.
