Its main goals are monetary and credential\ntheft. In Brazil, we have seen it distributing a malicious Google Chrome extension that attempts to steal\ncredit card data and online banking data, and that compromises the Boleto payment system.\n\n## Characteristics\n\nMispadu is a malware family, identified during our research of Latin American banking trojans, that targets\nBrazil and Mexico. It is written in Delphi and attacks its victims using the same method as the families\n[described earlier in this series: by displaying fake pop-up windows and trying to persuade the potential](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2019/08/01/banking-trojans-amavaldo/)\nvictims to divulge sensitive information.\n\nFor its backdoor functionality, Mispadu can take screenshots, simulate mouse and keyboard actions, and\ncapture keystrokes. It can update itself via a Visual Basic Script (VBS) file that it downloads and executes.\n\nAs with the other Latin American banking trojans, Mispadu also collects information about its victims,\nnamely:\n\nOS version\ncomputer name\nlanguage ID\nwhether Diebold Warsaw GAS Tecnologia (an application, popular in Brazil, to protect access to online\nbanking) is installed\nlist of installed common Latin American banking applications\nlist of installed security products\n\nAs in the cases of [Amavaldo and](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2019/08/01/banking-trojans-amavaldo/) [Casbaneiro, Mispadu can also be identified by its use of a unique, custom](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2019/10/03/casbaneiro-trojan-dangerous-cooking/)\ncryptographic algorithm to obfuscate the strings in its code. This is used in all components, as well as to\nprotect its configuration files and C&C communications. Figure 1 illustrates the core code implementing this\nalgorithm, and Figure 2 pseudocode for the algorithm.\n\n_Figure 1. Core of Mispadu’s algorithm for data decryption_\n\n\n-----\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n\ndef decrypt_string(data_enc, key):\n\nseed = data_enc[0] - 0x41 # 'A'\n\ndata_dec = str()\n\nfor i in range(1, len(data_enc), 2):\n\nb1 = (data_enc[i] - 0x41) * 25\n\nb2 = data_enc[i+1] - 0x41 - seed - key\n\ndata_dec += chr(b1 + b2)\n\nreturn data_dec\n\n\n_Figure 2. Pseudocode of Mispadu’s algorithm for data decryption_\nThe banking trojan executable comes with four potentially unwanted applications stored in its resource\nsection. These applications are all otherwise legitimate files from Nirsoft, but have been patched to run from\nthe command line with no GUI. They are used by the malware to extract stored credentials from:\n\nbrowsers (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer), and\nemail clients (Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird, and Windows Live Mail, among others).\n\nMispadu also monitors the content of the clipboard and tries to replace potential bitcoin wallets with its own,\nas Casbaneiro did. However, from examining the attacker’s wallet (see Figure 3), it has not been very\nsuccessful to date.\n\n_Figure 3. Bitcoin wallet used by the Mispadu operator_\n\n## Distribution\n\n\n-----\n\nMispadu employs two distribution methods: spam (see Figure 4) and malvertising. While the former method\nis very common for Latin American banking trojans, the latter is not, so let’s look at it more closely. Figure 5\nshows how the Mispadu attack unfolds.\n\n_Figure 4. Examples of spam emails distributing Mispadu. The one targeting Brazil (left) claims the recipient has been_\n_absent for three package delivery attempts and should follow the URL to get a refund. The one targeting Mexico (right)_\n\n_urges the recipient to download an invoice to avoid account “blockage”._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5. Mispadu’s distribution and execution chain_\n\nThe threat actor placed sponsored advertisements (see Figure 6 for a Brazilian example) on Facebook\noffering fake discount coupons for McDonald’s. Clicking the advertisements leads the potential victim to one\nof the webpages shown in Figure 7. Regardless of a visitor’s OS, clicking the button there leads to\ndownloading a ZIP archive containing an MSI installer. Occasionally, this archive also contains legitimate\nsoftware such as Mozilla Firefox or PuTTY, but they are mere decoys and are not used at all.\n\nMispadu operators compiled two different versions of the banking trojan based on the country it attacks.\nBesides that, they decided to use different installers and subsequent stages for each attacked country.\nHowever, the logic of both chains is the same and we describe that general form below.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6. Facebook ads set up by the Mispadu operators leading to fake McDonald’s coupon websites (translation of_\n\n_the ad title: “Use them on any September day! Independence coupons. Get yours now”)_\n\n_Figure 7. Malicious webpages offering fake discount coupons for McDonald’s Brazil (left) and Mexico (right)_\n\n_(translation of the main text of both: “This coupon can be used only once. I want! / Generate coupon”)_\n\nWhen the potential victim executes the MSI installer, a chain of three subsequent VBS scripts follows. The\nfirst script (unpacker) decrypts and executes the second script (downloader) from its internal data, as seen\nin Figure 8. The downloader script retrieves the third script (loader) and executes it (see Figure 9).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8. Mispadu distribution chain unpacker script (stage 1). Notice the key is calculated in variable w2 to the value_\n\n_95._\n\n_Figure 9. Mispadu distribution chain downloader script (stage 2). Notice the hardcoded key is the same as in the_\n\n_previous stage._\n\nThe loader script is more complicated than the first two stages. It is locale-specific; it checks the language\nidentifier of the potential victim machine to verify it really comes from the country targeted by the current\ncampaign (Brazil or Mexico, respectively). It can detect some virtual environments as well; if a virtual\nenvironment is detected or the desired locale is not found, the loader quits.\n\nOtherwise, the loader script continues by setting up configuration files (described in detail later) and\ndownloading (i) a Mispadu banking trojan, (ii) an injector (DLL) used to execute it and (iii) legitimate support\nDLLs. Each file is downloaded in a separate ZIP archive as illustrated in Figure 5. We provide pseudocode\nfor the decryption algorithm in Figure 10.\n\n\n-----\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n\ndef decrypt_payload(data_enc):\n\nkey = data_enc[0]\n\ndata_dec = str()\n\nfor i in range(1, len(data_enc)):\n\ndata_dec += chr(data_enc[i] - ((key + i - 1) % 10))\n\nreturn data_dec\n\n\n_Figure 10. Pseudocode of Mispadu’s payload decryption algorithm_\n\nMispadu’s download servers check the validity of requests they receive. Sending an invalid request results\nin an obscene image response we cannot reproduce here.\n\nFinally, the loader script sets up persistence by creating a link in the startup folder and executing the\ninjector. This is done via rundll32.exe by calling an exported function of the injector DLL whose name comes\nfrom one of the previously set up configuration files. The injector locates the encrypted banking trojan, then\ndecrypts and executes it.\n\nWe found an open directory on one of the servers Mispadu uses, and files connected to a very similar\n[campaign were stored there. Those files can be used to set up a webpage imitating AreaVIP (a tabloid](https://www.areavip.com.br/)\nwebsite in Brazil) and to force a fake Adobe Flash Player update on its potential victims. We have not\nobserved that campaign in the wild and believe it may be a setup for the future.\n\nSince the Mispadu campaign targeting Brazil used the Tiny.CC URL shortener, we were able to gather\nstatistics. As seen in Figure 11, this campaign produced almost 100,000 clicks, exclusively from Brazil. The\nclicks originating from Android are most likely the result of the fact that the advertisement is shown on\nFacebook regardless of the user’s device. You can also see that the campaign is recurring – one phase\nended in the second half of September 2019 and emerged again at the beginning of October 2019.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 11. Brazilian Mispadu campaign statistics_\n\n### Sharing an email attachment\n\nBoth spam emails and the fake McDonald’s website are interesting in one more aspect: from where the fake\ncoupon is downloaded. Mispadu’s operators abused the Russian Yandex.Mail platform to store their payload\n(see Figure 12). The most probable scenario is that the operators created an account on Yandex.Mail, sent\nan email with the malicious coupon as an attachment to themselves and then pointed the potential victim to\na direct link to this attachment.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 12. The URL from which the archive containing the malicious Mispadu MSI installer is downloaded_\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe use of configuration files is quite uncommon among Latin American banking trojans; yet, overall,\nMispadu utilizes three different ones and it cannot function without them. All of the configuration files are\neither contained in, or obtained by, the loader script described earlier.\n\nMispadu’s execution configuration is stored solely in memory with data downloaded from one of its\ndownload servers (Remote server 1 in Figure 5). It contains three crucial pieces of information:\n\na string necessary to create the URL to download the injector\nthe name of the folder where the malware will be installed\nthe name of the injector’s exported function to be called in order for it to execute the banking trojan\n\nGeneral configuration data are dropped to C:\\Users\\Public\\%COMPUTERNAME%[1], being named as the\nsecond letter in the victim’s computer name (so for a computer named “JOHN-PC”, the file would be named\n“O”). It is created from data contained in the loader script and in the execution configuration file and contains\nthe version information, cryptographic key and file system paths.\n\nC&C configuration data are stored to a file in the same location as the previous one under the same\nfilename with “_” appended (“O_”, to continue the previous example). It consists of:\n\n#ip# (a placeholder for an IP address the banking trojan uses to receive backdoor commands)\n#wp[1-3]# (placeholders for 3 ports associated with #ip#)\ntwo lists of 31 domains each (main list and backup list)\n\nMispadu chooses its main and backup C&C domains from these lists based on the current day of the\nmonth. It then tries to obtain an updated version of the C&C configuration file from that domain every few\nhours and replaces the dropped one with it. We believe the main idea behind this approach is to fill in the\nplaceholders in order to activate the backdoor functionality.\n\n## Protect your Chrome\n\nIt’s a good idea, just don’t do it with the malicious Google Chrome browser extension we have observed\nbeing distributed together with the Mispadu banking trojan in Brazil (see Figure 13). The extension (see\nFigure 14 is named “Securty [sic] System 1.0” and claims to help you “Protege seu Chrome” (translation:\n“Protect your Chrome”). It consists of three malicious JavaScript files that we describe below.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 13. Part of Mispadu’s distribution chain that changes when the malicious Google Chrome extension is_\n\n_distributed as well. The rest of the distribution chain remains the same._\n\n_Figure 14. The malicious Google Chrome extension installed by Mispadu_\n\n### Component 1: Manipulating windows\n\nThis simple component has only a single functionality: it creates a new Google Chrome window and closes\nall others. This component was not present in all samples we analyzed and we believe it is still in the testing\nphase.\n\n### Component 2: Stealing credit card data\n\nThe second component contains a hardcoded list of websites. In pages served from these sites, it looks for\nany input field containing “text”, “email”, “tel”, “number”, “password” or “radio”. If “CVV”, “CÓD SEG” or their\nvariants are found anywhere on the website, the content of those input fields is sent to the attacker when\nthe victim submits the information. This clearly reveals the intention of this part of the extension – theft of\ncredit card data.\n\n### Component 3: Stealing banking and Boleto data\n\nThe third component is the most advanced one. First, using a DGS-like algorithm, it generates two strings\nbased on current day of month and month number. Those strings are then used to form a GitHub URL in the\nform of https://raw.githubusercontent.com/%FIRST_STRING%/w/master/%SECOND_STRING%,\n\nwhere %FIRST_STRING% is a GitHub username. Data downloaded from the generated URL are decrypted\ninto a different URL we will call payload URL.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis component also contains a hardcoded list of targeted websites, as the previous one did. If the victim\nvisits one of these websites, a malicious JavaScript file specific to that website is obtained from the payload\n_URL and dynamically loaded via JavaScript’s eval function._\n\n[Besides that, this component also attempts to compromise the use of Boleto, a popular payment system](https://thebrazilbusiness.com/article/boleto-bancario-for-beginners)\ncommon in Brazil. The system has been an attractive target for attackers for a long time (you can read more\nin [this paper from 2014). To pay using this system, you have to print a ticket (boleto). That contains mainly](https://www.virusbulletin.com/uploads/pdf/conference/vb2014/VB2014-Assolini.pdf)\nan ID number specific to the bank account that should receive the payment, and a barcode (see Figure 15).\nPayment is then done by either scanning the barcode or typing the ID number manually.\n\n_Figure 15. An example of a boleto (source: Wikipedia)_\n\nUsing a [regular expression, the malware component tries to find the ID number and replace it with the](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression)\nattacker’s (obtained dynamically). Additionally, it abuses a legitimate website to generate the payment\nbarcode using the attacker’s account number and replaces the legitimate one with that. The part of the code\nresponsible for compromising Boleto is shown in Figure 16.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 16. Mispadu’s Google Chrome extension that compromises Boleto. Code obtaining the attacker’s account_\n\n_number is marked in red, malicious barcode generation in green._\n\n## Differences between campaigns\n\nBesides the already mentioned differences and the obvious fact that each variant of the Mispadu banking\ntrojan targets a different set of banks dependent on country of residence, the Brazilian campaign differs from\nthe Mexican one in several other minor aspects.\n\nIt seems to randomize the file system paths and filenames where configuration files are stored and the\nbanking trojan is installed for each victim. Additionally, the loader script contains a part that is not used at\n[the time of writing but that is ready to abuse Windows mshta.exe to execute the actual banking trojan](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1170/)\ninstead of rundll.exe.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this blog post, we have talked about Mispadu, another Latin American banking trojan family isolated\nduring our research. We have shown its main characteristics including reasons why we consider it a Latin\nAmerican banking trojan – it is written in Delphi, targets Brazil and Mexico, uses pop-up windows and\ncontains backdoor functionality.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe have described its most recent distribution chain and focused on some interesting aspects like\nYandex.Mail being abused to store the malicious payloads and the usage of malicious Facebook ads. We\nhave analyzed the configuration files used by Mispadu as well.\n\nFinally, we have talked about a malicious Google Chrome extension that we have seen Mispadu distributing\nin Brazil. This extension’s goal is to steal credit card information, sensitive banking information and attempt\nto steal money from its victims by compromising the Boleto payment system in Brazil.\n\n_For any inquiries, contact us at threatintel@eset.com.
