This signals just how long ago the Poseidon threat actor was already working\non its offensive framework.\n\nWhy has the Poseidon threat remained undetected for so many years? In reality, it has not.\nMost samples were detected promptly. However, Poseidon’s practice of being a ‘customtailored malware implants boutique’ kept security researchers from connecting different\ncampaigns under the umbrella of a single threat actor. This approach entails crafting\ncampaigns components on-demand and sometimes fabricating entirely unique malicious\nartifacts.\n\n1st Portuguese-speaking group #ThePoseidonAPT attacks companies globally\n#TheSAS2016\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsecurelist.com%2Fposeidon-group-a-targeted-attack-boutique-specializing-in-global-cyber-espionage%2F73673%2F&text=1st+Portuguese-speaking+group+%23ThePoseidonAPT+attacks+companies+globally+%23TheSAS2016)\n\nOur research team was able to put together the disparate pieces of this puzzle by diligently\ntracing the evolution of Poseidon’s toolkit in pursuit of an overarching understanding of how\nthe actor thinks and the specific practices involved in infecting and extorting its victims. With\na set of tools developed for the sole purpose of information gathering and privilege\nescalation, the sophistication level of campaign highlights that, today, regional actors are not\nfar behind better-known players in the global game of targeted attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\nBecoming familiar with the operations of the Poseidon Group meant patiently dismantling\ntheir modus operandi to unearth the custom-designed infection tools deployed to each of\ntheir selected targets. This process revealed a series of campaigns with highly-regionalized\nmalware practices and geographically-skewed victim tasking, unsurprising in a region with a\ngradually-maturing cybercrime industry. The proper detection of each iteration of their\nevolving toolkit may have been enough to thwart specific efforts, but to truly understand the\nmagnitude of Poseidon’s combined operations required an archeological effort to match.\n\n## Frequently asked questions\n\n### What exactly is the Poseidon Group?\n\nThe Poseidon Group is a long-running team operating on all domains: land, air, and sea.\nThey are dedicated to running targeted attacks campaigns to aggressively collect information\nfrom company networks through the use of spear-phishing packaged with embedded,\nexecutable elements inside office documents and extensive lateral movement tools. The\ninformation exfiltrated is then leveraged by a company front to blackmail victim companies\ninto contracting the Poseidon Group as a security firm. Even when contracted, the Poseidon\nGroup may continue its infection or initiate another infection at a later time, persisting on the\nnetwork to continue data collection beyond its contractual obligation. The Poseidon Group\nhas been active, using custom code and evolving their toolkit since at least 2005. Their tools\nare consistently designed to function on English and Portuguese systems spanning the\ngamut of Windows OS, and their exfiltration methods include the use of hijacked satellite\nconnections. Poseidon continues to be active at this time.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Why do you call it Poseidon s Targeted Attack Boutique?\n\nThe presence of several text fragments found in the strings section of executable files\nbelonging to the campaign reveal the actor’s fondness for Greek mythology, especially\nregarding Poseidon, the God of the Seas (which also coincides with their later abuse of\nsatellite communications meant to service ships at sea). The boutique element is reflected in\ntheir artisanally adaptive toolkit for lateral movement and data collection which appears to\nchange from infection to infection to fit custom-tailored requirements for each of their\nprospective clients. The business cycle includes what is euphemistically referred to as\n‘financial forecasting’ using stolen information, so we like to say that Poseidon’s boutique not\nonly deals in targeted attacks but also stolen treasures.\n\n### How did you become aware of this threat? Who reported it?\n\nWe noticed that several security companies and enthusiasts had unwittingly reported on\nfragments of Poseidon’s campaigns over the years. However, nobody noticed that these\nfragments actually belonged to the same threat actor. Perhaps because many of these\ncampaigns were designed to run on specific machines, using English and Portuguese\nlanguages, with diverse command and control servers located in different countries and soon\ndiscarded, signing malware with different certificates issued in the name of rogue companies,\nand so on. By carefully collecting all the evidence and then reconstructing the attacker’s\ntimeline, we found that it was actually a single group operating since at least 2005, and\npossible earlier, and still active on the market.\n\nWith this understanding, GReAT researchers were able to recognize similarities in\nobfuscation and development traits leading back to widely-reported but little understood\nvariants on a sample in 2015, which searched for prominent leaders and secret documents\ninvolving them.\n\n### When did you discover this targeted attack?\n\nThe very first samples from this campaign were detected by Kaspersky Lab back in the early\n2000s. However, as noted previously, it is a very complex task to correlate indicators and\nevidence in order to put together all the pieces of this intricate puzzle. By the middle of 2015\nit was possible to identify that throughout this period of time it’s been the same threat actor,\nwhich we call Poseidon Group.\n\n### Who are the victims? / What can you say about the targets of the attacks?\n\nThe targets are companies in energy and utilities, telecommunications, public relations,\nmedia, financial institutions, governmental institutions, services in general and\nmanufacturing. The geographical spread of victims is heavily-skewed towards Brazil, the\nUnited States, France, Kazakhstan, United Arab Emirates, India and Russia. Many of the\n\n\n-----\n\nvictims have joint ventures or partner operations in Brazil. The importance of the victims is\nnot measured in numbers since each of these victims is a large-scale (often multinational)\nenterprise.\n\n### What exactly is being stolen from the target machines?\n\nOne of the characteristics of the group behind Poseidon is an active exploration of domainbased networks. Such network topology is typical for companies and enterprises.\n\nThe highest value asset for these companies is proprietary information, technologies, and\nbusiness-sensitive information that represents significant value in relation to investments and\nstock valuations. The Poseidon Group actively targets this sort of corporate environment for\nthe theft of intellectual property and commercial information, occasionally focusing on\npersonal information on executives.\n\n### How does Poseidon’s APT Boutique infect computers?\n\nThe main infection vector for Poseidon is the use of spear-phishing emails including\nRTF/DOC files, usually with a human resources lure. The executables are also often digitally\nsigned and occasionally hidden in alternate data streams to fool security solutions.\nPoseidon’s toolkit displays an awareness of many antivirus providers over the years,\nattempting to attack or spoof these processes as a means of self-defense for their infections.\nOnce the infection happens, it reports to the command and control servers before beginning\na complex lateral movement phase. This phase will often leverage a specialized tool that\nautomatically collects a wide array of information including credentials, group management\npolicies, and even system logs to better hone further attacks and assure execution of their\nmalware. This way the attackers actually know what applications and commands they can\nuse without raising an alert to the network administrator during lateral movement and\nexfiltration.\n\n### What does the Poseidon Group do? What happens after a target machine is infected?\n\nOnce the target’s machine is compromised, the attacker first enumerates all processes\nrunning in the system and all services. Then the attacker looks for all administrator accounts\non both the local machine and the network. This technique allows them to map network\nresources and make lateral movements inside the network, landing in the perfect machine to\nmatch the attacker’s interest. This reflects the Poseidon Group’s familiarity with Windows\nnetwork administration. In many cases, their ultimate interest is the Domain Controller.\n\nAdditionally malware reports itself to its hardcoded command and control servers and\nestablished a backdoor connection, so the attacker may have a permanent remote\nconnection.\n\n\n-----\n\n### What are the malicious tools used by the Poseidon Group? What are their functions?\n\nPoseidon utilizes a variety of tools. Their main infection tool has been steadily evolving since\n2005, with code remnants remaining the same to this day, while others have been altered to\nfit the requirements of new operating systems and specific campaigns. A noteworthy addition\nto the Poseidon toolkit is the IGT supertool (Information Gathering toolkit), a bulking 15\nmegabyte executable that orchestrates a series of different information collections steps,\nexfiltration, and the cleanup of components. This tool appears to be designed to operate on\nhigh-value corporate systems like Domain Controllers or IIS servers that act as repositories\nof valuable information, particularly for lateral movement. The Information Gathering Tool\n(IGT) tool is coded in Delphi and includes powershell and SQL components across a dozen\ndifferent drops. This tool contains several other executable files made in different\nprogramming languages ranging from Visual Basic 6 to C#, each one performing a very clear\ntask devised by the group when trying to obtain more information from an objective. The\nmain purpose of the IGT tool is to make an inventory of the system, saving information from\nthe network interfaces and addresses, credentials belonging to the Domain and database\nserver, services being run from the OS and everything that could help the Poseidon Group\nmake its attack more customized to its victim.\n\n### Are the attackers using any zero-day vulnerabilities?\n\nNo zero-day vulnerabilities have been found in the analysis of the samples obtained\nregarding this campaign. Poseidon’s conventional means of deceiving users with executable\nfiles posing inside Word and RTF document files, and actual poisoned documents with\nmalicious macro-scripts has been the sole method used for compromising their desired\ntargets. As we have seen in other targeted campaigns, social engineering and carefully\ncrafted spear-phishing attacks play a crucial role in the effectiveness of getting a foothold in\nthe desired system.\n\n### Is this a Windows-only threat? Which versions of Windows are targeted?\n\nPoseidon is particularly focused on the Microsoft Windows operating system family,\nspecifically customizing the infection method for each one so as to gather different\ninformation and hide its presence after the initial infection. Other products usually found in\ncorporate environments, such as an SQL server, are being used for lateral movement and\ncredential harvesting using a customized toolset designed by the crafty Poseidon Group.\nBecause of Poseidon’s longevity, there are samples targeting Windows systems as early as\nWindows NT 4.0 Server and Windows 95 Workstation up to current versions like Windows\n8.1, as well as server variants (very important to them, given the emphasis on reaching\nDomain Controllers in corporate environments.)\n\n### How is this different from any other targeted attack?\n\n\n-----\n\nThe extortion elements of this campaign are what set it apart from others. The exfiltration of\nsensitive data is done in order to coerce the victim into a business relationship under the\nthreat of exchanging this information with competitors or leveraging it as part of the\ncompany’s offering of ‘investment forecasting’. Additionally this is the first ever publicly\nknown Portuguese-speaking targeted attacks campaign.\n\n### Are there multiple variants of the Poseidon Group’s malware? Are there any major differences in the variants?\n\nPoseidon has maintained a consistently evolving toolkit since the mid-2000s. The malware\nhas not avoided detection but instead been so inconspicuous as to not arouse much\nsuspicion due to the fact that this malware only represents the initial phase of the attack. An\naltogether different component is leveraged once Poseidon reaches an important machine\nlike an enterprise’s Domain Controller. This is where the main collection takes place by use\nof the IGT (Information Gathering Tool) toolkit.\n\n### Is the command and control server used by the Poseidon Group still active? Have you been able to sinkhole any of the command and controls?\n\nPoseidon Group has interesting practices when it comes to its use of command and control\nservers, including redundancies and quickly discarding command and control (C&Cs)\nservers after specific campaigns. This has actually allowed us to sinkhole several domains. A\nfew of these still had active infections attempting to report to the C&Cs. This adds an\ninteresting dimension to the story. As part of Kaspersky Lab’s commitment to securing\ncyberspace for everyone, we reached out and notified identifiable victims, regardless of their\nsecurity solution and provided them with indicators of compromise (IOCs) to help root out the\nactive infection. In the process, we were able to confirm the previously described operating\nprocedures for the Poseidon Group.\n\n### Is this a state-sponsored attack? Who is responsible?\n\nWe do not believe this to be a state-sponsored attack but rather a commercial threat player.\nCollaboration with information-sharing partners and victim institutions allowed us to become\naware of the more complicated business cycle involved in this story, greatly adding to our\nresearch interest in tracking these campaigns. The malware is designed to function\nspecifically on English and Portuguese-language systems. This is the first ever Portuguesespeaking targeted attack campaign.\n\n### How long have the attackers been active?\n\nThe attackers have been active for more than ten years. The main distribution of samples\ngoes back to 2005 with possible earlier outliers.\n\n\n-----\n\nOperating systems such as Windows 95 for desktop computers and Windows NT for server\neditions were not uncommon at the time and Poseidon’s team has evolved gradually into\ntargeting the latest flagship editions of Microsoft’s operating systems. Recent samples show\ninterest in Windows 2012 Server and Windows 8.1.\n\n### Did the attackers use any interesting/advanced technologies?\n\nDuring a particular campaign, conventional Poseidon samples were directed to IPs resolving\nto satellite uplinks. The networks abused were designed for internet communications with\nships at sea which span a greater geographical area at nearly global scale, while providing\nnearly no security for their downlinks.\n\nThe malware authors also possess an interesting understanding of execution policies which\nthey leverage to manipulate their victim systems. They combine reconnaissance of GPO\n(Group Policy Object management for execution) with digitally-signed malware to avoid\ndetection or blocking during their infection phases. These digital certificates are often issued\nin the name of rogue and legitimate companies to avoid arousing suspicion from researchers\nand incident responders.\n\n### Does Kaspersky Lab detect all variants of this malware?\n\nYes, all samples are detected by signatures and also heuristics. With a fully updated\nKaspersky Lab anti-malware solution, all customers are protected now. Kaspersky Lab\nproducts detect the malware used by Poseidon Group with the following detection names:\n\nBackdoor.Win32.Nhopro\n\nHEUR:Backdoor.Win32.Nhopro.gen\nHEUR:Hacktool.Win32.Nhopro.gen\n\n\n-----\n\n### How many victims have you found?\n\nAt least 35 victim companies have been identified with primary targets including financial and\ngovernment institutions, telecommunications, manufacturing, energy and other service utility\ncompanies, as well as media and public relations firms.\n\nThe archaeological effort of understanding such a long-standing group can severely\ncomplicate victim identification. We see traces of upwards of a few tens of companies\ntargeted. The exact number of the victims may actually vary. Since it is a very long term\ngroup, some victims may be impossible to identify now.\n\nAt this time, we are reaching out to victims of active infections to offer remediation\nassistance, IOCs, and our full intelligence report to help them counteract this threat. Any\nvictims or potential targets concerned about this threat should please contact us at\n[intelreports@kaspersky.com.](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:///intelreports@kaspersky.com)\n\n### Who is behind these attacks?\n\nWe do not speculate on attribution. Language code used to compile implants, as well as the\nlanguage used to describe certain commands used by the group, actually corresponds to\nPortuguese from Brazil. The inclusion of Portuguese language strings and preference for\nPortuguese systems is prominent throughout the samples.\n\nThe tasking of Poseidon’s campaigns appears to be heavily focused on espionage for\ncommercial interests. Speculating further would be unsubstantiated.\n\n### Reference samples hashes:\n\n2ce818518ca5fd03cbacb26173aa60ce\n\nf3499a9d9ce3de5dc10de3d7831d0938\n\n0a870c900e6db25a0e0a65b8545656d4\n\n2fd8bb121a048e7c9e29040f9a9a6eee\n\n4cc1b23daaaac6bf94f99f309854ea10\n\n2c4aeacd3f7b587c599c2c4b5c1475da\n\nf821eb4be9840feaf77983eb7d55e5f6\n\n2ce818518ca5fd03cbacb26173aa60ce\n\n### Command and control servers:\n\nakamaihub[.]com – SINKHOLED by Kaspersky Lab\n\nigdata[.]net – SINKHOLED by Kaspersky Lab\n\nmozillacdn[.]com – SINKHOLED by Kaspersky Lab\n\nmsupdatecdn[.]com – SINKHOLED by Kaspersky Lab\n\nsslverification[.]net – SINKHOLED by Kaspersky Lab\n\n\n-----\n\n**For more about counter Poseidon and similar attacks, read** **[this article in the](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/poseidon-apt/5165/)**\n**Kaspersky Business Blog.**\n\n[APT](https://securelist.com/tag/apt/)\n[Brazil](https://securelist.com/tag/brazil/)\n[Cyber espionage](https://securelist.com/tag/cyber-espionage/)\n[Digital Certificates](https://securelist.com/tag/digital-certificates/)\n[Targeted attacks](https://securelist.com/tag/targeted-attacks/)\n[TheSAS2016](https://securelist.com/tag/thesas2016/)\n\nAuthors\n\nGReAT\n\nPoseidon Group: a Targeted Attack Boutique specializing in global cyber-espionage\n\nYour email address will not be published.
