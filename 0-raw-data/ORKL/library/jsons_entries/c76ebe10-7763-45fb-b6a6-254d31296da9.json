This new subcommand incorporates three innovative and\nnovel techniques to aid the analysis and timestamp enrichment of Shimcache entries. This\nplug-in has been included with Chainsaw v2.6 and is available from the WithSecureLabs\nGitHub.\n\nThis subcommand enables incident responders to attribute specific timeframes to the entries\nwithin Shimcache data. This new capability represents a significant advancement in analysis\nand offers a powerful tool to enrich Shimcache data in a way not available previously.\n\nIn this blog post, we will delve into the details of the analysis techniques used by the\nWithSecure™ Incident Response team and explore how they enable us to derive timestamps\nfor Shimcache entries.\n\n## Background\n\n\n-----\n\nWithSecure™ Incident Response team was engaged in responding to a significant security\nbreach linked to the notorious CozyBear/APT29 threat group. Utilizing the advanced\ncapabilities of the WithSecure™ Under Attack service, which includes the deployment of the\nWithSecure™ EDR agent, our team swiftly obtained a comprehensive understanding of the\ncompromise. Within the 72-hour triage period, we discovered that the threat actor had\ninfiltrated the network several months prior, effectively spying on the key personnel by using\nthe M365 legacy authentication methods and Cobalt Strike beacons on compromised\ndevices. While we were able to confidently contain the incident, a crucial question remained\nunresolved: how long had APT29 been monitoring the critical personnel within the\norganization?\n\nUnfortunately, security monitoring was not in place, and the default log retention failed to\nencompass the entire duration of the compromise. However, we had a breakthrough when\nwe discovered that the threat actor's TTPs (tactics, techniques, and procedures) could be\nconsistently observed within the Shimcache. However, despite its usefulness, the Shimcache\ndoes not provide timestamps of activity, presenting a unique hurdle for our investigation.\nWhile we knew that we could not obtain exact timestamps, our team sought to determine if it\nwas possible to derive timeframes indicating when the threat actor's activities took place.\n\nLooking at the Shimcache from this perspective led us to novel analysis techniques\n(Technique 1 and 3) of the Shimcache that enabled us to pinpoint the initial threat actor\nactivity, with a granularity of one minute. This information subsequently allowed our team to\ndetermine the initial date of compromise and, crucially, identify patient zero. Thus, answering\nthe critical question of how long the threat actor had been spying on key personnel.\n\nFollowing the identification of the techniques, the main challenge with deriving timestamp\ninformation from Shimcache data was that those existing techniques required the use of\nmultiple open-source tools which could not be streamlined. Thanks to the funding secured\nfrom the EU-funded CC-Driver project, Markus Tuominen was able to complete the research\nand successfully incorporate this analysis method into Chainsaw. This research not only built\nupon our initial knowledge/techniques but also added new techniques and identified potential\nedge cases that incident responders should be mindful of. With the integration of this new\nanalysis method into Chainsaw, we are confident that cybersecurity professionals will have a\npowerful tool at their disposal for investigating complex security incidents.\n\nSpecial thanks go to Alex Kornitzer, WithSecure Lead Software Engineer, for his continued\nguidance and support in getting this research incorporated into Chainsaw.\n\n## Basics of Shimcache and Amcache\n\nAmcache and Shimcache are forensic artifacts found on Windows systems that can be used\nto analyse execution activity. The Amcache records data about installed applications, while\nShimcache logs data about executables introduced to a system. These artifacts are\n\n\n-----\n\ninvaluable in analysing execution activity and identifying potential security breaches.\nHowever, it should be noted that the information provided by the Amcache and Shimcache is\nlimited, and it is crucial to use additional tools and techniques to conduct a comprehensive\nanalysis of a security incident. For those who are already familiar with these artifacts, we still\nrecommend reading these sections as we cover some key information that is generally not\ncovered in most places.\n\n### Shimcache Introduction\n\nShimcache is a component of the Windows Application Experience and Compatibility\nfeature. It is used for quick lookups on program execution to determine if a compatibility layer\n(a “shim”) is needed to run the application. It is stored in the `SYSTEM` windows registry\nhive which can be found from `C:\\windows\\system32\\config\\SYSTEM`. This artefact is widely\nused in the industry to identify malicious binaries that a threat actor may have interacted\nwith.\n\nThe list of Shimcache entries is a top-down list of events related to executables. These\nevents are recorded when executables are first ‘shimmed’. This effectively means, an\nexecutable was scanned by the Windows operating system to determine the ideal profile to\nrun the executable in. Although the direct circumstances when the Shimcache shims an\nexecutable are undocumented, we know that shimming takes place when a user interacts\nwith an executable. This may be simply the user installing a program that is executing it for\nthe first time, or simply creating it on the system. However, one crucial fact to remember is\nthat the Shimcache does not contain entry insertion timestamps, but rather `last modified`\ntimestamps of the referred files.\n\n### Amcache Introduction\n\nThe Amcache is also a component of the Windows Application Experience and Compatibility\nfeature like the Shimcache. It is a windows registry hive file that contains various metadata\non programs, application files, and drivers. It is located at\n`C:\\Windows\\appcompat\\Programs\\Amcache.hve`.\n\nThe Amcache contains useful initial execution timestamps that can be used to enrich the\ntiming information of Shimcache entries. Below diagram shows the differences on how many\nmore timestamps can be derived if Amcache enrichment is enabled.\n\nAnalysis techniques 2 and 3 utilise the Amcache for further identification of timestamps. We\nfound in our tests that Amcache enrichment leads to 2.7x more timestamps on average as\nwell as providing SHA1 for some of the entries.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Analysis Techniques of Determining Shimcache Insertion Timestamps\n\nThe 'analyse' subcommand utilizes series of techniques to identify Shimcache insertion\ntimestamps. The idea of the analysis is to determine accurate insertion timestamps for as\nmany Shimcache entries as possible. This is done to provide defenders more context around\nwhat the threat actors may have executed or performed on a host. As threat actors\ncommonly download their tools on disk shortly before execution, the timestamps determined\nare almost certainly the time of execution, if not shortly before execution.\n\nFurthermore, having an accurate timestamp for Shimcache entries means that timing\ninformation of surrounding entries can be inferred:\n\nEvery entry that is below a timestamped entry was inserted before the timestamped\nentry\nEvery entry above a timestamped entry was inserted after the timestamped entry\n\nThe more timestamps there are, the tighter the time ranges of other entries in the Shimcache\nbecome. This allows for more accurate timing information about the existence of a\nfile/program on a system, and in some cases, execution timing. The figure below shows a\nsnippet of the analysis output and demonstrates derived timestamps. It also demonstrates\nhow time ranges for the entries without timestamps can be determined.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs previously mentioned, Shimcache entries are arranged in a top-down list consisting of\n1024 entries. The rate at which this list rolls over increases with the device's activity level.\nThrough our engagements, we have discovered that for certain servers, this rollover period\ncan extend up to four months. Thus, this analysis generally way more effective on Windows\nservers where user interaction is minimal compared to Windows workstations.\n\nThere are three different analysis techniques that can be applied to the Shimcache and\nAmcache. Techniques 1 and 3 have been applied in an actual incident and are tested, but\nthey have a few caveats. Technique 2 is based on new research. It is not enabled by default\nsince it has a few theoretical edge cases where it produces false results. These three\ntechniques are referenced as:\n\nTechnique 1 (T1) – Regex Rules\nTechnique 2 (T2) – Shimcache Amcache Near Timestamp Pair Detection\nTechnique 3 (T3) – Shimcache Amcache Timestamp Range Matching\n\nThe below figure illustrates the flow of the analysis process.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Technique 1 (T1) – Regex Rules\n\n**Chainsaw CLI parameters: '--regexfile <path>' or `-e <pattern>`**\n\nDuring several incident response engagements, WithSecure IR team observed that certain\nexecutables have a file last modified timestamp that corresponds to their first execution time.\n[A great example of this also noted in a blog post by Madiant. Such executables are usually](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/caching-out-the-val)\nautomatically downloaded update files or executables related to an installation that are\ndownloaded and executed right after download.\n\nWhen executed using the above parameters, the analyse plugin of Chainsaw performs the\nfollowing steps:\n\n1. All the Shimcache file paths are converted to lower-case.\n2. Match the regex rules against the lower-case paths of the entries.\n3. If the regex matches, the last modified file time of the Shimcache entry is interpreted as\n\nthe insertion timestamp of the same entry.\n\n\n-----\n\nBased on our research and incidents, we have provided a list of regex rule matching to such\nexecutables. This is available at the Chainsaw GitHub repository.\n[(analysis/shimcache_patterns.txt)](https://github.com/WithSecureLabs/chainsaw/blob/master/analysis/shimcache_patterns.txt)\n\n### Technique 2 (T2) - Shimcache Amcache Near Timestamp Pair Detection\n\n**Chainsaw CLI parameters: `--Amcache <Amcache.hve> --tspair`**\n\nIf the Shimcache file last modified timestamp and the Amcache key update timestamp for a\nfile are near each other (less than 60 seconds), it is highly likely that the entry was inserted\nto the Shimcache at one of those timestamps. The Amcache key update timestamp gets\ninterpreted as the Shimcache insertion timestamp in this case.\n\nThis technique is not enabled by default since it has a few edge cases where it makes it\nmore prone to produce incorrect timestamps. These cases are covered in the caveats and\nedge cases section.\n\n### Technique 3 (T3) – Shimcache Amcache Timestamp Range Matching\n\n**Chainsaw CLI parameters: `--Amcache <Amcache.hve>`**\n\nOnce technique 1 and optionally 2 are applied, the insertion time ranges of Shimcache\nentries are determined. So, if an Amcache entry falls within this range and has a matching\nShimcache entry with the same file path, it can be deduced that the Shimcache insertion\ntimestamp must be near if not the same as the Amcache timestamp.\n\n## Accuracy Caveats and Edge Cases\n\nBecause the Shimcache insertion timestamps are interpreted from other timestamps, they\nare inferred times and will never be completely accurate. This may cause the timeline\ntimestamps to be out of order. An analyst should be aware of these limitations when\nperforming investigations using these techniques and where possible should support their\nconclusions from other evidence sources.\n\n### T1 Caveats\n\nThe technique T1 uses the “file last modified” timestamp as the insertion timestamp. The\ntimestamps that come from using this method are always going to be slightly before the\nactual Shimcache insertion time. This is due to the order of events that lead to the matched\nexecutables being inserted to the Shimcache:\n\n1. The executable file gets created\n\nfile last modified timestamp set.\nThis is the timestamp used by T1 technique\n\n\n-----\n\n2. Delay. Threat actor typing command to execute, Windows processing etc.\n3. The executable gets either executed or scanned and inserted to the Shimcache\n\nThis is the actual insertion timestamp that is not availabe at the time of analysis\n\nDepending on the executable, the delay could be milliseconds, seconds, or even minutes at\nworst. However, even the executables that have longer delays are still worth including. as\nthey can still provide useful timing information in long running timelines with large time gaps\nbetween events. Certain executables have more accurate timestamps than others. This\nfactor should be taken into account when picking the regex patterns that are used in the\nanalysis.\n\n### T2 Caveats\n\n**Maximum Time Difference Between the Timestamp Pair**\n\nThe current maximum time difference between the timestamps is 60 seconds. This\nessentially means that there is a +-60 second margin of error on the timestamps. This may\nintroduce discrepancies in the final timeline of events.The Amcache timestamp is interpreted\nas the Shimcache insertion timestamp.\n\nIn some cases, it might be that the Shimcache file last modified timestamp is closer to the\nactual insertion timestamp. Currently the Amcache key update timestamp is always\ninterpreted as the Shimcache insertion timestamp since it often corresponds to the actual\nexecution time. In some cases, this might introduce inaccuracies to the timestamps.\n\n**Shimcache Entry Gets Updated in Place**\n\nDuring testing we identified Windows operating system may update the Shimcache entry inplace instead of creating a new entry at the top. We identified this was possible to replicate\nfollowing the below specific steps. This can create timestamp detection when a file is\nupdated in-place:\n\n1. A file gets scanned but not executed (gets inserted to Shimcache)\n2. That file is later updated, replaced with a newer version (file last modified time updated)\n3. The file gets executed right after (timestamp gets updated in-place in Shimcache &\n\ngets inserted to Amcache at the same time)\n4. The timestamps in the Shimcache and Amcache are now near each other, and a false\n\ndetection gets produced since the Shimcache entry was inserted before the\ntimestamps\n\n### T3 Caveats\n\n\n-----\n\n**Wide Time Ranges May Cause Inaccuracies**\nThe wider the time ranges are, the higher the possibility of getting an inaccurate Shimcache\nAmcache match in a time range.\n\nAn extreme example would be where there is only one time range that spans the entirety of\nthe Shimcache. In this example there are only two entries in the timeline with a determined\ntimestamp: one at the bottom and one at the top. Now every Shimcache entry between these\ntwo entries is in this same time range. If there is an Amcache entry with a matching file path,\nit is very likely that the Amcache timestamp matches this time range, since the timespan\ncovers a very long time. This means that even if the Shimcache insertion happened during a\ncompletely different time than the Amcache insertion, the Amcache timestamp still gets\ninterpreted as the Shimcache insertion time. If there are multiple Shimcache entries all these\nentries will be matched to Amcache timestamp as the Shimcache insertion time. This may\nlead to false timestamps and produce an out-of-order timeline with invalid time ranges.\n\n**Out of Order Timestamps**\n\nThere is a possibility that some of the timestamps inferred with this technique might produce\nout of order timestamps on the timeline. This is due to the fact that the Amcache key update\ntimestamp might have occurred at a slightly different time than the Shimcache insertion. This\nis mostly a problem with Shimcache entries that were inserted in a burst during a short time\nframe.\n\n## What's Next?\n\nWe understand that the execution artifacts are crucial in incident response investigations, but\nunfortunately, they often remain undocumented. We hope that the tool, approach, and\ntechniques we presented in this article will provide further insight and value to incident\nresponders.\n\nWe utilized experimental, case study, and observational research methods in this research.\nOur team is working on a separate research project which focuses on reverse engineering\ncritical execution artefacts line by line to gain a deeper understanding of the structure and\nfunctionality of these artifacts. We hope to uncover new insights that can be used to make\nbetter use of evidence left by threat actors.\n\nAt the WithSecure Incident Response Team, we are committed to research and pushing the\nboundaries of what’s possible. But we are also a friendly bunch! 😊 We encourage you to\nmake use of our tools and reach out to us (cir@withsecure.com) if you have any questions or\nsuggestions for improvements.\n\n\n-----",
