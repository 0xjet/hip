The group tends to adapt publicly available techniques\nand tools for their attacks and experiments with published proof-of-concept exploits.\nLeafminer attempts to infiltrate target networks through various means of intrusion: watering\nhole websites, vulnerability scans of network services on the internet, and bruteforce/dictionary login attempts. The actor’s post-compromise toolkit suggests that the group\nis looking for email data, files, and database servers on compromised target systems.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1 Leafminer targeting organizations in Middle East region\n\n\n-----\n\n## Leafminer’s arsenal\n\nDuring our investigation, there was a breakthrough discovery that helped connect Leafminer\nto a number of attacks observed on systems in the Middle East and identify the toolkit used\nin the group’s efforts of intrusion, lateral movement, and exfiltration. The download URL for a\nmalware payload used in one of the attacks lead to the identification of a compromised web\nserver on the domain e-qht.az that had been used to distribute Leafminer’s arsenal of\nmalware, payloads, and tools within the group and make them available for download from\nvictim machines.\n\nAs of early June 2018, the server hosted 112 files in a subdirectory that could be accessed\nthrough a public web shell planted by the attackers. In addition to malware and tools, the\nserved files also included uploads of log files seemingly originating from vulnerability scans\nand post-compromise tools.\n\nThe web shell is a modification of the PhpSpy backdoor and references the author\nMagicCoder while linking to the (deleted) domain magiccoder.ir. Researching the hacker\nhandle MagicCoder results in references to the Iranian hacking forum Ashiyane as well as\ndefacements by the Iranian hacker group Sun Army.\n\n## Targets\n\nDuring the investigation of the Leafminer group, we were able to assemble a targeting profile\nfrom different sources including telemetry and log files hosted publicly on the attacker’s\narsenal server.\n\nOne interesting source of target information discovered during the Leafminer\ninvestigation was a list of 809 targets used by the attackers for vulnerability scans.\n\nSymantec detection telemetry shows malware and custom tools used by Leafminer on 44\nsystems across four regions in the Middle East.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2. Infected computers per\n\nregion\nOne interesting source of target information discovered during the Leafminer investigation\nwas a list of 809 targets used by the attackers for vulnerability scans. The list is written in the\nIranian language Farsi and groups each entry with organization of interest by geography and\nindustry. Figure 3 shows a breakdown of the industry verticals. Targeted regions included in\nthe list are Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, Egypt, Israel, and\nAfghanistan.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3. Industry\n\nverticals targeted by Leafminer\n\n## Intrusion\n\nWe observed three main techniques used by Leafminer for initial intrusion of target networks:\n\nCompromised web servers used for watering hole attacks\nScans/exploits for vulnerabilities of network services\nDictionary attacks against logins of network services\n\nThere are indicators that suggest the attackers have also employed email phishing with\nmalicious attachment files. However, this was not directly observed or captured.\n\n## Watering hole SMB credential theft\n\nOur investigation of Leafminer started with the discovery of JavaScript code on several\ncompromised websites in the Middle East. The obfuscated code was planted by the\nattackers to steal SMB credential hashes that could subsequently be brute-forced offline.\n\nWhen executing the code, the browser creates an invisible image tag and sets the URL to an\nattack server using the file:// protocol scheme. On Windows machines, this triggers a request\nto a remote server via the Samba networking protocol (SMB) that also transmits the user’s\nlogin NTLM hash. These hashes can be cracked to retrieve the original login password by\nmethods of brute-force, dictionary, or rainbow table lookups.\n\nTable 1 shows an overview of the compromised websites used as watering holes, infected\nJavaScript URLs, and SMB URLs used to collect NTLM hashes.\n\n\n-----\n\nTable 1. Watering hole website details\nInterestingly, the same technique was also observed in watering hole attacks by the threat\nactor [Dragonfly in 2017 as reported by Symantec.](https://www.symantec.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/dragonfly-energy-sector-cyber-attacks)\n\n## Vulnerability scans and exploitation\n\nAs previously mentioned, Leafminer seems to be actively following developments and\npublications of the offensive security community when selecting their toolkit. This became\nespecially apparent when analyzing the group’s techniques and tools for vulnerability scans\nand exploitation. The compromised web server used to store Leafminer’s arsenal hosted\nseveral public proof-of-concept exploits and exploitation tools.\n\n\"Leafminer espionage group makes use of available tools, research, and work of other threat\nactors https://symc.ly/2MNFOOD\"\n[Click to Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Leafminer%20espionage%20group%20makes%20use%20of%20available%20tools,%20research,%20and%20work%20of%20other%20threat%20actors%20https://symc.ly/2MNFOOD&via=threatintel&hashtags=undefined)\nThis included the Fuzzbunch framework that was part of an infamous leak of exploits and\ntools by the Shadow Brokers in April 2017. Leafminer has developed exploit payloads for this\nframework (Table 2) that deliver custom malware through attacks against SMB vulnerabilities\n[described by Microsoft. The EternalBlue exploit from the framework received worldwide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/securitybulletins/2017/ms17-010)\n[attention after being used in the ransomware campaigns WannaCry in May and](https://www.symantec.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/wannacry-ransomware-attack)\n[Petya/NotPetya in June 2017. The Leafminer operators use EternalBlue to attempt lateral](https://www.symantec.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/petya-ransomware-wiper)\nmovement within target networks from compromised staging servers.\n\n[Symantec also observed attempts by Leafminer to scan for the Heartbleed vulnerability](https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/heartbleed-bug-poses-serious-threat-unpatched-servers)\n(CVE-2014-0160) from an attacker-controlled IP address. Furthermore, the Leafminer\narsenal server hosted a Python script to scan for this vulnerability.\n\n## Dictionary attacks\n\nAnother intrusion approach used by Leafminer seems a lot less sophisticated than the\npreviously described methods but can be just as effective: using specific hacktools to guess\nthe login passwords for services exposed by a targeted system. This type of attack was\nobserved both via dedicated servers set up by Leafminer as well as staging servers\ncompromised by the group.\n\n\n-----\n\nCommands found in a readme text that was stored in a ZIP archive together with the\nhacktool THC Hydra in Leafminer’s tool arsenal represent online dictionary attacks on\nMicrosoft Exchange and Remote Desktop Protocol services of regional government servers\nin Saudi Arabia. \"Online\" in this case refers to the attacker using the protocol of the targeted\nnetwork service to quickly run through many password guesses.\n\n## Custom malware\n\nSymantec identified two strains of custom malware used by the Leafminer group:\n[Trojan.Imecab and](https://www.symantec.com/security-center/writeup/2018-052111-1609-99) [Backdoor.Sorgu. Directly connected to this malware are several sets of](https://www.symantec.com/security-center/writeup/2018-052111-1102-99)\nreflective loader DLLs used as droppers or to execute specific commands on a compromised\nsystem.\n\nThe development of custom malware by Leafminer as well as some of the tools used for\nlateral movement show a preference for the .NET framework. We also observed that the\nattackers would download and install the .NET framework on compromised machines,\nsupposedly in the situation that an operator would have remote access to the system but\nrequired .NET to run Leafminer's custom tools. To this end, the command and control (C&C)\nserver operated by the group hosted the legitimate setup executable for Microsoft .NET\nFramework 2.0 SP2.\n\n### Backdoor.Sorgu\n\nBackdoor.Sorgu is used by the attackers to provide remote access to the infected machine.\nThe backdoor is installed as a service in the Windows system through a shell command\nscript.\n\n### Trojan.Imecab\n\nThe purpose of Trojan.Imecab is to set up a persistent remote access account on the target\nmachine with a hardcoded password. Variants of the malware were also observed with the\nfilename guester.exe which likely refers to the functionality of adding a powerful guest\naccount to the system.\n\nThe malware installs itself in the system as a Windows service to achieve persistence and\nensure that the guest account remains available to the attacker.\n\n## Reflective loader DLLs\n\nTable 2 gives an overview of the reflective loader DLLs and their purpose:\n\n\n-----\n\nTable 2. Reflective loader DLLs\nThese DLLs were likely used as payloads for exploit shellcode of the Fuzzbunch framework,\nwhich is also evidenced by the embedded PDB strings.\n\n## Lateral movement and exfiltration\n\nThe discovery of malware and hacktools hosted on e-qht.az allowed us to correlate detection\ntelemetry of potential Leafminer intrusions with tools made available for download to the\ngroup’s operators. Understanding the purpose of the tools used by the attacker gives a\nunique insight into the tactics and procedures used by Leafminer after the initial compromise\nof a target network.\n\nTable 3 outlines the observed toolset for lateral movement, information gathering, and\nexfiltration.\n\n\n-----\n\nTable 3. Toolset for lateral movement, information gathering, and exfiltration\nWe discovered a number of servers compromised by Leafminer that were used as staging\nsystems to gain a foothold in the targeted network and execute attacks on intranet\nresources. For example, the use of THC Hydra to execute dictionary attacks against\nExchange logins was observed both in initial intrusion attempts as well as in lateral attacks\nfrom staging systems.\n\nFigure 4 shows a screenshot of the Total SMB BruteForcer hacktool used by Leafminer for\nlateral movement. The tool requires input files with lists of IPs, users, and passwords\nrespectively.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4. Total SMB BruteForcer\nThe arsenal server hosted five text files that could be used by Leafminer operators as input\nfor dictionary attacks using Total SMB Bruteforcer and THC Hydra.\n\n## OrangeTeghal and Process Doppelgänging\n\nOne of the custom tools used by the Leafminer group is a rebranded version of the\nwidespread post-exploitation tool Mimikatz.\n\nFigure 5.\n\nOrangeTeghal\nWhile the logo and commands are identical to the original hacktool, the name was changed\nto OrangeTeghal. To evade security software while deploying this tool on compromised\nsystems, the attackers use a technique revealed at Black Hat EU ‘17 in the presentation Lost\n_in Transaction: Process Doppelgänging. The malware file orange64.exe is a .NET_\nexecutable that drops and executes a PowerShell script with basic obfuscation. After\n\n\n-----\n\ndeobfuscation, this script closely resembles the code published by the authors of the\ntechnique. Process Doppelgänging uses NTFS transactions to modify the executable of a\nseemingly benign process that is suspended right after creation.\n\n## Ambitions blunted by inexperience\n\nLeafminer is a highly active group, responsible for targeting a range of organizations across\nthe Middle East. The group appears to be based in Iran and seems to be eager to learn from\nand capitalize on tools and techniques used by more advanced threat actors.\n\nOn a broad level, it has followed the recent trend among targeted attack groups for “living off\nthe land”—using a mixture of publicly available tools alongside its own custom malware.\nMore specifically, it mimicked Dragonfly’s use of a watering hole to harvest network\n[credentials. It also capitalized on the Shadow Brokers release of Inception Framework tools,](https://www.symantec.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/inception-framework-hiding-behind-proxies)\nmaking use of the leaked Fuzzbunch framework by developing its own exploit payloads for it.\n\nLeafminer’s eagerness to learn from others suggests some inexperience on the part of\nthe attackers, a conclusion that’s supported by the group’s poor operational security.\n\nLeafminer has also been tracking developments in the world of cyber security. After the\nHeartbleed bug was disclosed it began scanning for instances of the vulnerability. It also\nutilized Process Doppelgänging, a detection evasion technique first discussed at the Black\nHat EU conference last year.\n\nHowever, Leafminer’s eagerness to learn from others suggests some inexperience on the\npart of the attackers, a conclusion that’s supported by the group’s poor operational security. It\nmade a major blunder in leaving a staging server publicly accessible, exposing the group’s\nentire arsenal of tools. That one misstep provided us with a valuable trove of intelligence to\nhelp us better defend our customers against further Leafminer attacks.\n\n## Protection\n\nSymantec has the following protections in place to protect customers against Leafminer\nattacks:\n\n**File-based protection**\n\n[Backdoor.Sorgu](https://www.symantec.com/security-center/writeup/2018-052111-1102-99)\n[Trojan.Imecab](https://www.symantec.com/security-center/writeup/2018-052111-1609-99)\n\n## Threat intelligence\n\n[Customers of the DeepSight Intelligence Managed Adversary and Threat Intelligence (MATI)](https://www.symantec.com/services/cyber-security-services/deepsight-intelligence/adversary)\nservice have received intelligence that details the characteristics of the Leafminer cyber\nespionage group and methods of detecting and thwarting activities of this adversary\n\n\n-----\n\n## Best Practices\n\nImportant passwords, such as those with high privileges, should be at least 8-10\ncharacters long (and preferably longer) and include a mixture of letters and numbers.\nEncourage users to avoid reusing the same passwords on multiple websites and\nsharing passwords with others should be forbidden. Delete unused credentials and\nprofiles and limit the number of administrative-level profiles created. Employ two-factor\n[authentication (such as Symantec VIP) to provide an additional layer of security,](https://vip.symantec.com/)\npreventing any stolen credentials from being used by attackers.\nEmphasize multiple, overlapping, and mutually supportive defensive systems to guard\nagainst single point failures in any specific technology or protection method. This\nshould include the deployment of regularly updated firewalls as well as gateway\nantivirus, intrusion detection or protection systems (IPS), website vulnerability with\nmalware protection, and web security gateway solutions throughout the network.\nImplement and enforce a security policy whereby any sensitive data is encrypted at\nrest and in transit. Ensure that customer data is encrypted as well. This can help\nmitigate the damage of potential data leaks from within an organization.\nImplement SMB egress traffic filtering on perimeter devices to prevent SMB traffic\nleaving your network onto the internet.\nEducate employees on the dangers posed by spear-phishing emails, including\nexercising caution around emails from unfamiliar sources and opening attachments\nthat haven’t been solicited. A full protection stack helps to defend against emailed\n[threats, including Symantec Email Security.cloud, which can block email-borne threats,](https://www.symantec.com/products/email-security-cloud)\n[and Symantec Endpoint Protection, which can block malware on the](https://www.symantec.com/products/endpoint-protection)\n[endpoint. Symantec Messaging Gateway’s Disarm technology can also protect](https://www.symantec.com/products/messaging-gateway)\ncomputers from threats by removing malicious content from attached documents\nbefore they even reach the user.\nUnderstanding the tools, techniques, and procedures (TTP) of adversaries through\n[services like DeepSight Adversary Intelligence fuels effective defense from advanced](https://www.symantec.com/services/cyber-security-services/deepsight-intelligence/adversary)\nadversaries like Leafminer. Beyond technical understanding of the group, strategic\nintelligence that informs the motivation, capability, and likely next moves of the\nadversaries ensures more timely and effective decisions in proactively safeguarding\nyour environment from these threats.\n\n## IOCs\n\nSymantec has also developed a list of Indicators of Compromise to assist in identifying\nLeafminer activity:\n\n## File Attachments\n\n\n-----\n\n## About the Author\n\n### Threat Hunter Team\n\n**Symantec**\n\nThe Threat Hunter Team is a group of security experts within Symantec whose mission is to\ninvestigate targeted attacks, drive enhanced protection in Symantec products, and offer\nanalysis that helps customers respond to attacks.\n\n## About the Author\n\n### Network Protection Security Labs\n\nNetwork Protection Security Labs is a group of security experts within Network Protection\nProducts doing advanced security research to continuously improve Symantec Network\nProducts.\n\n## Want to comment on this post?\n\n\n-----",
