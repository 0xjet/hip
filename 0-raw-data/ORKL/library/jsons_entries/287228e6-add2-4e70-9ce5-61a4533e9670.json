The Trickbot Group operated in Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, and\nSuriname, and primarily targeted victim computers belonging to businesses, entities, and\nindividuals, including those in the Northern District of Ohio and elsewhere in the United\nStates. Targets included hospitals, schools, public utilities, and governments. Witte, who\npreviously resided in Paramaribo, Suriname, was arrested on Feb. 6, in Miami, Florida.\n\n“This indictment demonstrates the broad reach of the Department of Justice’s Ransomware\nand Digital Extortion Task Force,” said Deputy Attorney General Lisa O. Monaco. “Trickbot\ninfected millions of victim computers worldwide and was used to harvest banking credentials\nand deliver ransomware. The defendant is accused of working with others in the\ntransnational criminal organization to develop and deploy a digital suite of malware tools\n\n\n-----\n\nused to target businesses and individuals all over the world for theft and ransom. These\ncharges serve as a warning to would-be cybercriminals that the Department of Justice,\nthrough the Ransomware and Digital Extortion Task Force and alongside our partners, will\nuse all the tools at our disposal to disrupt the cybercriminal ecosystem.”\n\n“The Trickbot malware was designed to steal the personal and financial information of\nmillions of people around the world, thereby causing extensive financial harm and inflicting\nsignificant damage to critical infrastructure within the United States and abroad,” said Acting\nU.S. Attorney Bridget M. Brennan of the Northern District of Ohio. “Federal law enforcement,\nalong with assistance provided by international partners, continue to fight and disrupt\nransomware and malware where feasible. We are united in our efforts to hold transnational\nhackers accountable for their actions.”\n\n“Witte and her associates are accused of infecting tens of millions of computers worldwide, in\nan effort to steal financial information to ultimately siphon off millions of dollars through\ncompromised computer systems,” said Special Agent in Charge Eric B. Smith of the FBI’s\nCleveland Field Office. “Cyber intrusions and malware infections take significant time,\nexpertise, and investigative effort, but the FBI will ensure these hackers are held\naccountable, no matter where they reside or how anonymous they think they are.”\n\nThe indictment alleges that beginning in November 2015, Witte and others stole money and\nconfidential information from unsuspecting victims, including businesses and their financial\ninstitutions in the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Belgium, Canada, Germany,\nIndia, Italy, Mexico, Spain, and Russia through the use of the Trickbot malware.\n\nWitte and her co-conspirators allegedly worked together to infect victim computers with the\nTrickbot malware designed to capture online banking login credentials and harvest other\npersonal information, including credit card numbers, emails, passwords, dates of birth, social\nsecurity numbers and addresses. Witte and others also allegedly captured login credentials\nand other stolen personal information to gain access to online bank accounts, execute\nunauthorized electronic funds transfers and launder the money through U.S. and foreign\nbeneficiary accounts.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Witte worked as a malware developer for the Trickbot Group\nand wrote code related to the control, deployment, and payments of ransomware. The\nransomware informed victims that their computer was encrypted, and that they would need\nto purchase special software through a Bitcoin address controlled by the Trickbot Group to\ndecrypt their files. In addition, Witte allegedly provided code to the Trickbot Group that\nmonitored and tracked authorized users of the malware and developed tools and protocols to\nstore stolen login credentials.\n\nWitte is charged with one count of conspiracy to commit computer fraud and aggravated\nidentity theft; one count of conspiracy to commit wire and bank fraud affecting a financial\ninstitution; eight counts of bank fraud affecting a financial institution; eight counts of\n\n\n-----\n\naggravated identity theft and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. The\ndefendant was arraigned before U.S. Magistrate Judge William H. Baughman Jr. of the U.S.\nDistrict Court for the Northern District of Ohio. If convicted, she faces a maximum penalty of\nfive years in prison for conspiracy to commit computer fraud and aggravated identity theft; 30\nyears in prison for conspiracy to commit wire and bank fraud; 30 years in prison for each\nsubstantive bank fraud count; a two-year mandatory sentence for each aggravated identity\ntheft count, which must be served consecutively to any other sentence; and 20 years in\nprison for conspiracy to commit money laundering. A federal district court judge will\ndetermine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory\nfactors.\n\nThe FBI’s Cleveland Office investigated the case.\n\nSenior Counsel C.S. Heath of the Criminal Division’s Computer Crime and Intellectual\nProperty Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Daniel J. Riedl and Duncan T. Brown of the\nNorthern District of Ohio are prosecuting the case.\n\nThis case is part of the Department of Justice’s Ransomware and Digital Extortion Task\nForce, which was created to combat the growing number of ransomware and digital extortion\nattacks. As part of the Task Force, the Criminal Division, working with the U.S. Attorneys’\nOffices, prioritizes the disruption, investigation, and prosecution of ransomware and digital\nextortion activity by tracking and dismantling the development and deployment of malware,\nidentifying the cybercriminals responsible, and holding those individuals accountable for their\ncrimes. The department, through the Task Force, also strategically targets the ransomware\ncriminal ecosystem as a whole and collaborates with domestic and foreign government\nagencies as well as private sector partners to combat this significant criminal threat.\n\n_An indictment is merely an allegation and the defendant is presumed innocent until proven_\n_guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law._\n\nAttachment(s):\n\n[Download Witte indictment](https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1401766/download)\nTopic(s):\n\nCybercrime\n\nIdentity Theft\n\nPress Release Number:\n\n21-524\n\n\n-----",
