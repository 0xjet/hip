While the\nattackers have compromised multiple targets in the region, only selected targets in Saudi\nArabia were infected with Shamoon.\n\n[On February 15, publications from IBM (The Full Shamoon) and Palo Alto (Magic Hound)](https://securityintelligence.com/the-full-shamoon-how-the-devastating-malware-was-inserted-into-networks/)\nseparately discussed a persistent attack campaign operating primarily in the Middle East\nwith links to Shamoon. This campaign was conducted by a group we identify as\nTimberworm. The group appears to have facilitated the third wave of destructive attacks\ninvolving Shamoon in January 2017. Timberworm operates in the Middle East and beyond.\nOnly specific organizations affiliated with Saudi Arabia appear to have been earmarked for\ndestructive wiping attacks.\n\nDuring the January attacks, Symantec discovered a high correlation between Timberworm\nand the presence of Shamoon in a number of organizations in Saudi Arabia. Timberworm\nappears to have gained access to these organizations’ networks weeks and, in some\ncases, months before the Shamoon attacks occurred. Once on the network, the attackers'\n[primary goal appeared to be similar to Greenbug (an actor previously discussed in relation](https://community.broadcom.com/symantecenterprise/viewdocument?DocumentKey=dbb48763-8f17-49c7-8c09-813e97a62b37&CommunityKey=1ecf5f55-9545-44d6-b0f4-4e4a7f5f5e68&tab=librarydocuments)\nto the November 17 wave of attacks): detailed network reconnaissance, credential\nharvesting, and persistent remote access.\n\nWhen Timberworm had sufficient access to a number of high value organizations, Shamoon\nwas then preconfigured with a wipe date and the necessary credentials to maximize the\noverall impact during a coordinated attack. This procedure is consistent with what was\nobserved during Greenbug operations prior to the November 17 attacks, which may indicate\nthat multiple groups are cooperating to facilitate these destructive attacks, possibly at the\ndirection of a single entity.\n\n## Stage 1: Timberworm recon\n\n\n-----\n\nTimberworm s carefully planned operation saw the attackers send spear phishing emails to\nindividuals at targeted organizations. In some cases, the emails contained Microsoft Word\nor Excel files as attachments. In others, the emails contained malicious links, which if\nclicked, downloaded similar Word or Excel files.\n\n### Computer network exploitation\n\nOpening the document invoked PowerShell from a malicious macro, which provided the\nattackers with remote access to the compromised computer. Some basic reconnaissance\nwas then performed using existing system tools to determine if the target was of interest.\nOnce Timberworm was satisfied, it then deployed custom malware, hacktools, and software\ntraditionally used in system/network administration. Some of the tools deployed during\nthese attacks included:\n\nPsExec, a tool for executing processes on other systems from Microsoft Sysinternals\nPAExec, a free re-implementation of PsExec from Poweradmin\nNetscan, a multipurpose IPv4/IPv6 network scanner\nSamdump, a hacking tool that dumps Windows password hashes\n[Mimikatz (Hacktool.Mimikatz), a hacking tool to harvest credentials](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2012-042615-3731-99&tabid=2)\nTightVNC, an open-source remote desktop access application\nPlink, a command line network connection tool supporting encrypted communications\nRar, archiving utility for compressing files before ex-filtration.\n\nDuring this phase, once the attacker appeared to have achieved the desired level of\nnetwork access, Plink was executed to provide an additional avenue of remote access (Fex\nreverse RDP over SSH connections). This pattern of activity is also consistent with what\nwas observed during Greenbug operations in 2016, before the eventual deployment of\nShamoon.\n\n## Stage 2: Shamoon destruction\n\nAt this point the attackers configured the Shamoon payloads per organization and then\ncoordinated the attacks on a pre-determined date. In the January 23 attacks Symantec\nobserved consistent usage of PAExec across numerous organizations to initially deploy\nW32.Disttrack.B. After it was deployed, it would self-propagate and wipe accessible\ncomputers across the network.\n\n## Multiple teams cooperating?\n\nTimberworm appears to be a much larger operation, infiltrating a much broader range of\norganizations beyond those affected by the recent Shamoon attacks. Similarly, Greenbug\ntargeted a range of organizations in the Middle East beyond those affected by Shamoon,\n\n\n-----\n\nincluding companies in the aviation, energy, government, investment, and education\nsectors. While both groups leveraged two distinct toolsets, their targets, tactics, and\nprocedures align very well and in close proximity to the coordinated wiping events.\n\n## “Living off the land”\n\nThe Shamoon attacks illustrate how a growing number of targeted attack groups are relying\non common-off-the-shelf tools to compromise targets. The Shamoon attackers managed to\nget access to targets’ networks using socially engineered spear-phishing emails and\nabusing Office macros and PowerShell to gain initial footholds. In particular, the use of\n[PowerShell has been a popular tactic of late. Recent Symantec research found a total of](https://community.broadcom.com/symantecenterprise/viewdocument?DocumentKey=cbd24b89-1022-4fe8-800d-a362f3d4cf06&CommunityKey=1ecf5f55-9545-44d6-b0f4-4e4a7f5f5e68&tab=librarydocuments)\n111 malware families that use the PowerShell command line. More than 95 percent of the\nPowerShell scripts analyzed through the BlueCoat Malware Analysis sandbox were found\nto be malicious.\n\nThe appeal of “living off the land” is obvious. Attackers believe malicious activity will be\nmore difficult to detect if legitimate tools are involved and malware use is kept to a\nminimum. The use of legitimate tools may also serve to thwart attribution to specific actors.\n\n## Protection\n\nSymantec and Norton products protect against Shamoon with the following detections:\n\n**Antivirus:**\n\n[W32.Disttrack](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2012-081608-0202-99)\n[W32.Disttrack!gen1](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2012-081708-3504-99)\n[W32.Disttrack!gen4](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2012-090306-5105-99)\n[W32.Disttrack!gen6](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2012-090306-5953-99)\n[W32.Disttrack!gen7](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2012-091717-3231-99)\n[W32.Disttrack!gen8](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2012-091313-2116-99)\n[W32.Disttrack.B](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2016-112300-5555-99)\n[Backdoor.Mhretriev](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2017-022712-2204-99)\n[Hacktool.Mimikatz](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2012-042615-3731-99&tabid=2)\n\n**Intrusion prevention system:**\n\n[System Infected: Disttrack Trojan Activity 2](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/attacksignatures/detail.jsp?asid=25885)\n[System Infected: Disttrack Trojan Activity 3](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/attacksignatures/detail.jsp?asid=25926)\n\n## Indicators of compromise\n\n**Netscan**\n\nMD5\n\n\n-----\n\n1ef78a72e4957c04197992bab2f86335\n\nSHA256\n\n63d51bc3e5cf4068ff04bd3d665c101a003f1d6f52de7366f5a2d9ef5cc041a7\n\n**TightVNC**\n\nMD5\n\na2ff24322c12558eb1f29aea3ca6f24a\n\nSHA256\n\n1ba26bcd857944b0486a76928f41f74d91dad492b46ea93c4ca246a0503cdaae\n\n**Hacktool.Mimikatz**\n\nMD5\n\na9ae14b298fb12fad76347ff8f61dd40 (x86)\n\n27552cd0d24cb1eb59259d2acd7181bf (x64)\n\nSHA256\n\n0de2b74ff045f7c1af2d42aaf00aa98d44351850a968faf7b37bfa650684003c (x86)\n\n28290b9475c62039dda26b64e45f3e14815b6acd9ed49156a14e361df0524af8 (x64)\n\n**PAExec**\n\nMD5\n\n22e9853298c96b1ab89d8f71c4e82302\n\nSHA256\n\n01a461ad68d11b5b5096f45eb54df9ba62c5af413fa9eb544eacb598373a26bc\n\n\n-----",
