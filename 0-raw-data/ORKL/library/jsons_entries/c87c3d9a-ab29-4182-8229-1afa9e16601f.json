Unit 42 created the moniker\n“PKPLUG” for the threat actor group, or groups, behind these and other documented attacks\nreferenced later in this report. We say group or groups as our current visibility doesn’t allow\nus to determine with high confidence if this is the work of one group, or more than one group\nwhich uses the same tools and has the same tasking. The name comes from the tactic of\ndelivering PlugX malware inside ZIP archive files as part of a DLL side-loading package. The\nZIP file format contains the ASCII magic-bytes “PK” in its header, hence PKPLUG.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile tracking these attackers, Unit 42 discovered additional, mostly custom malware\nfamilies being used by PKPLUG beyond that of just PlugX. The additional payloads include\n[HenBox, an Android app, and Farseer, a Windows backdoor. The attackers also use the](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-henbox-chickens-come-home-roost/)\n9002 Trojan, which is believed to be shared among a small subset of attack groups. Other\npublicly available malware seen in relation to PKPLUG activity includes Poison Ivy and\nZupdax.\n\nDuring our investigations and research into these attacks, we were able to relate previous\nattacks documented by others that date back as far back as six years ago. Unit 42\nincorporates these findings, together with our own, under the moniker PKPLUG and continue\nto track accordingly.\n\nIt’s not entirely clear as to the ultimate objectives of PKPLUG, but installing backdoor Trojan\nimplants on victim systems, including mobile devices, infers tracking victims and gathering\ninformation is a key goal.\n\nWe believe victims lay mainly in and around the Southeast Asia region, particularly Myanmar,\nTaiwan, Vietnam, and Indonesia; and likely also in various other areas in Asia, such as Tibet,\nXinjiang, and Mongolia. Based on targeting, content in some of the malware and ties to\ninfrastructure previously documented publicly as being linked to Chinese nation-state\nadversaries, Unit 42 believes with high confidence that PKPLUG has similar origins.\n\n## Targeting\n\nBased on our visibility into PKPLUG’s campaigns and what we’ve learned from collaborating\nwith industry partners, we believe victims lay mainly in and around the Southeast Asia\nregion. Specifically, the target countries/provinces include (with higher confidence), Myanmar\nand Taiwan as well as (with lower confidence), Vietnam and Indonesia. Other areas in Asia\ntargeted include Mongolia, Tibet and Xinjiang. This blog, and the associated Adversary\nPlaybook, provides further details including: the methods used for malware delivery, the\nsocial engineering topics of decoy applications and documents and the Command & Control\n(C2) infrastructure themes.\n\n[Indonesia, Myanmar and Vietnam are ASEAN members, contributing towards](https://asean.org/asean/asean-member-states/)\nintergovernmental cooperation in the region. Mongolia, specifically the independent country\nalso known as Outer Mongolia, has a long-standing and complex relationship with the PRC.\n[Tibet and Xinjiang are autonomous regions (AR) of China that tend to be classified by](https://www.sporcle.com/blog/2019/04/what-are-the-autonomous-regions-of-china/)\nChina’s ethnic minorities, granted the ability to govern themselves but ultimately answering to\nthe People’s Republic of China (PRC). Tibet and Xinjiang are the only ARs, from five, where\nthe ethnic group maintains a majority over other populations.\n\nMost, if not all, of the seven countries or regions, are involved in some way with Beijing's Belt\nand Road Initiative (BRI) designed to connect 71 countries across Southeast Asia to Eastern\n[Europe and Africa. The path through Xinjiang is especially important to the BRI’s success,](https://thegeopolitics.com/china-and-xinjiang-the-fate-of-bri/)\n\n\n-----\n\nbut is more often heard of [due to conflicts between the Chinese government and the ethnic](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/chinas-crackdown-uighurs-xinjiang)\n[Uyghur population. News of the BRI is peppered with stories of success and failure, of](https://www.businessinsider.com/map-explains-china-crackdown-on-uighur-muslims-in-xinjiang-2019-2)\ncountries for and against the BRI and of countries pulling out of existing BRI projects.\n\n[Further tensions in the region are attributed to ownership claims over the South China Sea,](https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2018/08/asia/south-china-sea/)\nincluding fishing quotas and the yet unproven oil and gas reserves. At least three of the\ntarget countries mentioned (Malaysia, Taiwan and Vietnam) have laid claim to parts of these\nwaters, and some use the area for the vast majority of their trade. Foriegn militaries also\npatrol, attempting to keep the area open.\n\nTaiwan, which isn’t an AR and doesn’t appear to be actively involved with the BRI, has its\n[own long-standing history with the PRC -- a recent $2.2 billion arms sale with the U.S. may](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2019/07/10/china-demands-us-cancel-arms-sale-taiwan.html)\nexacerbate matters.\n\n## Timeline\n\nBefore continuing, it’s worth highlighting our research and others relating to the intrusion set\nthat we refer to as PKPLUG. This section documents prior work surrounding cyber attacks\nrelating to PKPLUG. The following figure illustrates the chronological order of the\npublications -- highlighting some key findings from each.\n\nAs you can see from the timeline, PKPLUG has been active for six years or more with a\nvariety of targets and methods of delivery and compromise.\n\n_Figure 1. Timeline of publications and key findings relating to PKPLUG_\n\n\n-----\n\nPlease note: the dates shown on the horizontal timeline bar in Figure 1 above relate to the\npublishing date, not the campaign dates, although some were fairly close together. As an\nexample to illustrate the difference in dates, HenBox was discovered in 2018 but has\nsamples ranging from 2015 through to this week. PlugX and Poison Ivy are still doing the\n[rounds and their use by different groups is well known. Whether they relate to PKPLUG is](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0013/)\nanother matter.\n\n[#1: In November 2013, Blue Coat Labs published a report describing a case of attacks](https://web.archive.org/web/20161017235500/https://www.bluecoat.com/security-blog/2013-11-25/plugx-used-against-mongolian-targets)\nagainst Mongolian targets using PlugX malware. Like so many other attacks using PlugX\nover the past decade or more, Blue Coat noted the DLL side-loading technique used to\nlaunch the malicious payload via legitimate, signed applications. Their report also\ndocumented the group’s use of an exploit against software vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office.\nIn this case, using a weaponized Word document saved as a Single File Web Page format -usually having an mht file extension -- in order to exploit CVE-2012-0158 to drop and\nexecute a signed WinRAR SFX archive containing the side-loading package and PlugX\npayload. Considering all the malware related to PKPLUG that Unit 42 has analyzed, the use\nof such exploits appears to be less common than a spear-phishing technique making use of\nsocial engineering to lure victims into running their malware.\n\n#2: A [report published in April 2016 by Arbor Networks detailed recent cyber attacks using](https://web.archive.org/web/20160618095613/https://www.arbornetworks.com/blog/asert/recent-poison-iv/)\nPoison Ivy malware against targets in Myanmar and other countries in Asia over the previous\ntwelve months.\n\nThey noted phishing emails using ASEAN membership, economics and democracy-related\ntopics to weaponize documents delivering the Poison Ivy payloads. While Arbor didn’t know\nthe exact victims, they inferred suspect targets based on the content of emails and\nassociated malware. DLL side-loading was also mentioned as the method to install the\nmalware.\n\n#3: [Unit 42 published research that reported attacks using the 9002 Trojan delivered through](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit-42-attack-delivers-9002-trojan-through-google-drive/)\nGoogle Drive. The download originated with a spear-phishing email containing a shortened\nURL that redirected multiple times before downloading a ZIP file hosted on Google Drive.\nThe redirection using HTTP also contains information about the victim who received the\nspear-phish and clicked the link. In this case, the information related to a well-known\npolitician and human rights activist in Myanmar. The filename of the ZIP archive also related\nto initiatives in the country, as did the decoy document contents. The ZIP file contained a\nDLL side-loading package abusing a Real Player executable signed by RealNetworks, Inc. in\norder to load the 9002 payload.\n\n[#4: In March 2017, researchers published a report in Japanese (later translated into English)](http://blog.0day.jp/p/english-report-of-fhappi-freehosting.html)\nthat described attacks seen by VKRL -- a Hong Kong-based cybersecurity company -- that\nwere using spear-phishing emails with URLs using GeoCities Japan to deliver malware. The\ncontent of the website contained encoded VBScript that executed PowerShell commands to\ndownload a Microsoft Word document from the same GeoCities site, as well as another\n\n\n-----\n\nencoded PowerShell script closely resembling PowerSploit -- a PowerShell post-exploitation\nframework for pentesters that’s available on GitHub -- that was responsible for decoding and\nlaunching a Poison Ivy payload.\n\nAnother GeoCities account was found hosting similar packages, including one targeting\nMongolia based on the contents of the decoy documents. The contents of the file, assuming\na victim clicked on the URL in the spear-phishing email, resembles the structure used in a\ntechnique known as AppLocker Bypass whereby trusted Windows executables can be used\nto execute malicious payloads.\n\n#5: In early 2018, [Unit 42 discovered a new Android malware family that we named](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-henbox-chickens-come-home-roost/)\n“HenBox” and is tracking over 400 related samples dating back as far as late 2015, and\ncontinuing to present day. HenBox often masquerades as legitimate Android apps and\nappears to primarily target the Uyghurs -- a minority Turkic ethnic group that is primarily\nMuslim and lives mainly in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in Northwest China and\nalso targets devices made by Chinese manufacturer Xiaomi.\n\nSmartphones are the dominant form of internet access in the region and hence make good\ntargets for such malware. Once installed, HenBox steals information from a myriad of\nsources on the device including harvesting outgoing phone calls to numbers with an “+86”\nprefix -- the country code for the PRC -- and accessing the device microphone and cameras.\n\nDuring investigations, data revealed an older version of HenBox had been downloaded from\nthe uyghurapps[.]net website, which appears to be third-party Android app store serving the\nUyghur community based on the domain name, language of the site and app content hosted.\nHenBox was masquerading as an another app -- DroidVPN -- which was also embedded\nwithin HenBox and installed post-infection.\n\n#6: Based on further investigations and pivoting around HenBox infrastructure, Unit 42\ndiscovered a previously-unknown Windows backdoor Trojan called Farseer. Farseer also\nuses the DLL side-loading technique to install payloads -- this time favoring a signed\nMicrosoft executable from VisualStudio to appear benign. A VBScript component is used, via\na registry persistence hook, to launch the Microsoft executable and the Farseer payload\nduring the user login process. In earlier Farseer variants, we saw decoy documents being\nused, including one case of a PDF containing a news article relating to Myanmar. Mongolia\nalso appears to be a target based on telemetry provided by an industry partner of ours.\n\nFurther information relating to these publications, together with respective Indicators of\nCompromise (IoC) and Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) used, are available in the\nPKPLUG [Adversary Playbook.](https://pan-unit42.github.io/playbook_viewer/?pb=pkplug)\n\n## Tying It All Together\n\n\n-----\n\nThe following Maltego image shows the vast majority of known infrastructure and some of\nthe known malware samples related to PKPLUG, and the chart continues to grow as we\ndiscover more about this adversary. The indexed shapes that overlay the figure provide a\nreference back to the published work chronology mentioned above.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2. PKPLUG Maltego diagram highlighting published research_\n\n\n-----\n\nOverlaps between the different campaigns documented, and the malware families used in\nthem, exist both in infrastructure (domain names and IP addresses being reused, sometimes\nin multiple cases) and in terms of malicious traits (program runtime behaviors or static code\ncharacteristics are also where relationships can be found or strengthened).\n\nFigure 3 below shows a very simplified view of the six core publications again, as per Figure\n2 above, but with trimmed-down infrastructure to highlight some of the core overlaps.\n\n_Figure 3. Simplified Maltego diagram showing high-level ties_\n\nThe C2 infrastructure blogged by Blue Coat Labs in their publication (#1) “PlugX used\nagainst Mongolian targets” included ppt.bodologetee[.]com has infrastructure ties\nmicrosoftwarer[.]com through a shared IPv4 with parent domain bodologetee[.]com. Domain\nmicrosoftwarer[.]com was found after threat hunting based on facts provided in publication\n(#4) “\"FHAPPI” Campaign: FreeHosting APT PowerSploit Poison Ivy” in relation to the\nFHAPPI campaign.\n\nThe FHAPPI campaign (#4) was documented as using PowerShell and PowerSploit code in\norder to infect victims with Poison Ivy, but very similar code was also found around PlugX\nmalware, some of which had C2 communication with logitechwkgame[.]com. Domain\nlogitechwkgame[.]com was documented by Unit 42 in publication (#3) “Attack Delivers 9002\nTrojan Through Google Drive” as the C2 for the 9002 Trojans analyzed. FHAPPI is also\nconnected through another malware using C2 infrastructure that relates, through a shared\n\n\n-----\n\nIPv4 address, to microsoftdefence[.]com, which malware documented in Arbor Networks\npublication (#2) “Poison Ivy Activity Targeting Myanmar, Asian Countries” also used for C2\ncommunication. Other Poison Ivy samples also related to the campaigns documented by\nArbor Networks used domain webserver.servehttp[.]com for C2 communication. Said\nsamples also shared overlaps in runtime characteristics with other Poison Ivy samples that\nhave been analyzed and confirmed as having C2 communications with certain domains that\nrelate to both Blue Coat Labs’ publication (#1) and Unit 42’s research into Farseer malware\nand their publication (#6) “Farseer: Previously Unknown Malware Family bolsters the\nChinese armoury”. Domains include yahoomesseges[.]com and outhmail[.]com, tcpdo[.]net,\nqueryurl[.]com and cdncool[.]com respectively. The same registrant of yahoomesseges[.]com\n\n- mongolianews@yahoo[.]com - also registered ppt.bodologetee[.]com mentioned slightly\nearlier.\n\nSome HenBox malware has used domain cdncool[.]com as well for its C2 communications,\nas documented in Unit 42’s publication (#5) “The Chickens Come Home to Roost.” Domain\ncdncool[.]com is thus connected not only to HenBox and Farseer campaigns, but also,\nthrough Poison Ivy malware, to the campaigns documented by Blue Coat Labs and Arbor\nNetworks. HenBox is also connected through a third-level domain update.queryurl[.]com to\nqueryurl[.]com that has been used for C2 communications by some Farseer samples.\n\nOther overlaps, mainly in infrastructure also exist (as seen in Figure 2 above) but are difficult\nto describe in a blog like this, hence using Maltego. Figure 3, as mentioned earlier, is a\nsimplified diagram to highlight some core overlaps.\n\n## PKPLUG’s Adversary Playbook\n\n[Unit 42 has previously described and](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-introducing-the-adversary-playbook-first-up-oilrig/) [published](https://github.com/pan-unit42/playbook_viewer/tree/master/playbook_json) [Adversary Playbooks you can view using our](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unveiling-11-new-adversary-playbooks/)\n[Playbook Viewer. To recap briefly, Adversary Playbooks provide a Threat Intelligence](https://pan-unit42.github.io/playbook_viewer/)\npackage in STIX 2.0 that include all IoCs for known attacks by a given adversary. In addition,\nsaid packages also include structured information about attack campaigns and adversary\n[behaviours -- their TTPs) -- described using Mitre’s ATT&CK framework.](https://attack.mitre.org/)\n\n[The Adversary Playbook for PKPLUG can be viewed here, and the STIX 2.0 content behind](https://pan-unit42.github.io/playbook_viewer/?pb=pkplug)\nthat can be [downloaded from here. The Playbook contains several Plays (aka campaigns;](https://github.com/pan-unit42/playbook_viewer/blob/master/playbook_json/pkplug.json)\ninstances of the Attack Lifecycle) that map, for the most part, to published research\npreviously mentioned in this blog. There exists Plays including specific details from\npublications by Blue Coat Labs, Arbor Networks, our publication on the 9002 Trojan, and the\nFHAPPI campaign. HenBox has two Plays -- one for the known attack compromising a thirdparty app store to deliver the malware and another containing all other HenBox data. A\nsimilar single campaign exists for Farseer containing all related data.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n\n-----\n\nEstablishing a clear picture and understanding about a threat group, or groups, is virtually\nimpossible without total visibility into every one of their attack campaigns. Based on this,\napplying a handle or moniker to a set of related data -- such as network infrastructure,\nmalware behavior, actor TTPs relating to delivery, exfiltration, etc. -- helps us to better\nunderstand what it is we’re investigating. Sharing this information -- with a handle, in this\ncase PKPLUG -- especially in a structured, codified manner a la Adversary Playbooks,\nshould allow others to contribute their vantage points and enrich said data until the\nunderstanding of a threat group becomes lucid.\n\nBased on what we know and what we’ve gleaned from others’ publications, and through\nindustry sharing, PKPLUG is a threat group, or groups, operating for at least the last six\nyears using several malware families -- some more well-known: Poison Ivy, PlugX, and\nZupdax; some are less well-known: 9002, HenBox, and Farseer. Unit 42 has been tracking\nthe adversary for three years and based on public reporting believes with high confidence\nthat it has origins to Chinese nation-state adversaries. PKPLUG targets various countries or\nprovinces in and around the Southeast Asia region for multiple possible reasons as\n[mentioned above, including some countries that are members of the ASEAN organisation,](https://asean.org/asean/asean-member-states/)\n[some regions that are autonomous to China, some countries and regions somewhat involved](https://www.sporcle.com/blog/2019/04/what-are-the-autonomous-regions-of-china/)\nwith China’s [Belt and Road Initiative, and finally, some countries that are embroiled in](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/ng-interactive/2018/jul/30/what-china-belt-road-initiative-silk-road-explainer)\n[ownership claims over the South China Sea.](https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2018/08/asia/south-china-sea/)\n\nThe Playbook Viewer helps to highlight some of the more common TTPs used by PKPLUG\nbut, based on our visibility, spear-phishing emails to deliver payloads to their victims is very\npopular. Some email attachments contained exploits taking advantage of vulnerable\nMicrosoft Office applications, however this technique was less commonly used compared\nwith social engineering to lure the victim into opening attachments. DLL side-loading seems\nalmost ubiquitous as a method to install or run their payloads, though perhaps more recently,\nPowerShell and PowerSploit is also being considered. Other TTPs are described in the STIX\n2.0 package and presented in the Viewer.\n\nThe use of Android malware shows intent to get at targets where perhaps traditional\ncomputers, operating systems and ways of communicating are different from previous\ntargets.\n\nPalo Alto Networks detects customers are protected by these threats through the following:\n\nCustomers using AutoFocus can view this activity by using the following tags:\n[PKPlug](https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.PKPlug)\nAll malware identified are detected as malicious by WildFire and Traps\n\nPalo Alto Networks has shared our findings, including file samples and indicators of\ncompromise, in this report with our fellow Cyber Threat Alliance members.
