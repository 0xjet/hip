For example if someone was running a phishing\ncampaign and wanted to fool a user into clicking a link, the domain used for the link may not\neven matter if it is masked in the email and the user is going to believe they are clicking on\nsomething else in the HTML. A low value malicious domain is likely to be used in this\nscenario. This could involve something as easy as registering a subdomain similar to the\nintended victim as part of a dynamic domain service such as noip.org. An example of these\nrecently around would be.\n\nhxxps://voicenett.serveftp[.]com/6s17aiqf1hczfv7e\n\nThese don’t necessarily need to survive for very long depending on what the next stage of\nthe planned attack is and can be redirected to any desired payload.\n\nNext in the stack would be similar domains to the victim or the victims supply chain. These\ncan work very well particularly for email campaigns.\n\nSome recent examples from threat feeds would be\n\nLevel 2\n\nloop.microsoftmse[.]com\n\nwellsconfirm-account[.]com\n\naliorbank[.]io\n\nThe use case may this time be to put in the reply-to field of an email as an example.\nBusiness Email Compromise would be a typical example. Its a little more visible to the\nvictim and therefore needs to be convincing.\n\n\n-----\n\nOn the next tier would be domains that stand out by themselves and look like they would\nprovide a valid service. These are getting into the high value territory now as there may not\nbe an obvious reason to block them. They don’t look like another domain to be caught by a\ntypo squatting rule and may not look anomalous in network traffic, or the service copied is\nvery generic like Microsoft. However the use case is different to those mentioned before as\nit may not be email related.\n\nLevel 3\n\nmicrosoftupdateswin[.]com\n\nserviceupdates[.]net\n\nservicesupdater[.]com\n\nThese are very convincing and can be used for long standing campaigns and may survive\nfor a period of time. This also results in these domains being recycled and reused over the\nyears, even if they have previously been taken down after being discovered being involved\nin malicious activity.\n\nDifferentiating after this is broken down into tactics and procedures of the attacker and\nthings get quite difficult. In order not to give away too much of the defenders toolkit I won’t\ngo into further detail on this.\n\n**Examples From** **[UNC2452 also known as](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-with-sunburst-backdoor.html)** **[Dark Halo/Sunburst](https://www.volexity.com/blog/2020/12/14/dark-halo-leverages-solarwinds-compromise-to-breach-organizations/)**\n\nSo now to the indicators from the recent breaches that have been revealed so far.\n\nNearly all the domains fit into the level 3 category and some would fit into a category higher\ndue to associated tactics. Firstly they used one main domain which was critical to their\ncampaign.\n\nAvsvmcloud[.]com\n\nThis was further broken down into various subdomains using a Domain Generation\n[Algorithm. Some good work was done on uncovering the links to victim names here.](https://www.netresec.com/?page=Blog&month=2020-12&post=Reassembling-Victim-Domain-Fragments-from-SUNBURST-DNS)\n\nThis primary domain had its own Nameserver which only had one domain on it.\n\n\"domain\": \"avsvmcloud[.]com\",\n\n\"to_ns_srv_domain_density\": {\n\n\"a1-139.avsvmcloud[.]com\": 1,\n\n\n-----\n\na11-64.avsvmcloud[.]com : 1,\n\n\"a20-65.avsvmcloud[.]com\": 1,\n\n\"a26-67.avsvmcloud[.]com\": 1,\n\n\"a4-65.avsvmcloud[.]com\": 1,\n\n\"a6-66.avsvmcloud[.]com\": 1\n\nThe domain switched to using this name server on 27th February 2020 around the time the\nattack began\n\nThe list of Nameserver changes for this domain is here\n\nNS Changes. 2\n\n\"date\": 20191207,\n\n\"days_ago\": 374,\n\n\"domain\": \"avsvmcloud[.]com\",\n\n\"from_nameservers\": [\n\n\"ns1.dnsowl.com\",\n\n\"ns2.dnsowl.com\",\n\n\"ns3.dnsowl.com\"\n\n\"to_nameservers\": [\n\n\"pdns09.domaincontrol.com\",\n\n\"pdns10.domaincontrol.com\"\n\n\"date\": 20200227,\n\n\"days_ago\": 292,\n\n\"domain\": \"avsvmcloud.]com\",\n\n\"to_ns_srv_domain_density\": {\n\n\"a1-139.avsvmcloud.com\": 1,\n\n\n-----\n\na11-64.avsvmcloud.com : 1,\n\n\"a20-65.avsvmcloud.com\": 1,\n\n\"a26-67.avsvmcloud.com\": 1,\n\n\"a4-65.avsvmcloud.com\": 1,\n\n\"a6-66.avsvmcloud.com\": 1\n\nThere are a few notable details here. Switching of name servers just before a campaign\nsignifies a management process around attacker infrastructure and that is the case for most\nof the domains in this campaign. Therefore we give these types of domains a higher\ncategory of “Managed High Value Malicious Domains” In our API for our Threat Intelligence\nenrichment we capture this concept with the field of NameServer Entropy.\n\nThe rest of the domains have a similar profile except they use a shared NameServer.\n\nDomain\n\nAvsvmcloud[.]com\n\nFreescanonline[.]com\n\nZupertech[.]com\n\nPanhardware[.]com\n\nDatabasegalore[.]com\n\nIncomeupdate[.]com\n\nHighdatabase[.]com\n\nWebsitetheme[.]com\n\nThedoccloud[.]com\n\nVirtualdataserver[.]com\n\nLcomputers[.]com\n\nWebcodez[.]com\n\ndeftsecurity[.]com\n\ndigitalcollege[.]org\n\n\n-----\n\nglobalnetworkissues[.]com\n\nkubecloud[.]com\n\nseobundlekit[.]com\n\nsolartrackingsystem[.]net\n\nvirtualwebdata[.]com\n\nTo push this idea to the next stage is to see if you can evolve this profile and use it to hunt\nfor more similar domains and see if this technique is more widespread.\n\nCreating a query to look for similar profiles to the main domain which had to operate from its\nown nameserver may lead to other instances of actors using the same technique.\n\nThis leads us to a list of very useful domains that have been registered in a similar pattern\nas the original avsvmcloud[.]com. This does not mean these are in any way malicious, just\nworthy of a further look.\n\nUpdates[.]run\n\n[fedora-dns-update[.]com was associated with APT22 (Suckfly)back between 2014-2016](https://paper.seebug.org/papers/APT/APT_CyberCriminal_Campagin/2016/2016.05.17.Indian_organizations_targeted_in_Suckfly_attacks/indian-organizations-targeted-suckfly-attacks.pdf)\nbut unknown now\n\nvirtualserverfaq[.]com\n\nmicrosoftsonline[.]net -which has already been identified in a different [breach claimed to be](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-sentinel/hunting-for-barium-using-azure-sentinel/ba-p/1875913)\nAPT41\n\nmicrolynconline[.]com -which has already been identified in a different [breach claimed to be](https://decoded.avast.io/luigicamastra/apt-group-targeting-governmental-agencies-in-east-asia/)\nAPT27\n\nThe list is much longer but very much speculation, so we won’t list any more in a public\nforum. Threat Hunters can use this profiling methodology to query datasets such as from\n[Silent Push to draw a list of candidates worthy of monitoring. Keeping an internal Passive](https://silentpush.com/)\nDNS service going on your own organizational traffic and hunting on all newly encountered\ndomains within that to correlate with the list of profiled domains would also be worth doing.\n\nAnother useful piece of information that surfaces from this is that it is worthwhile searching\nwithin the vast volume of threat indicators you receive for “High Value Domains” and\ntreating them differently. We have made this available in the advanced filtering part of the\nThreat Intelligence Analysts interface.\n\n\n-----\n\nOur [Silent Push enrichment service is now available to Beta customers and those on our](https://silentpush.com/)\ncustomer advisory board.
