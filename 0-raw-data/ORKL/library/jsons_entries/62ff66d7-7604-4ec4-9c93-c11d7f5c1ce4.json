Likewise, we assess with high\nconfidence that the goal of the activity is surveillance, as the Catholic Church has been\ndiplomatically active in countries that are of special interest for the Chinese government.\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nDuring 2020, several researchers and security vendors reported on targeted malware\nused against the Roman Catholic Church. [1] [2] [3] [4]. These revolved around a few\nknown toolsets commonly associated with Chinese threat actors, notably the PlugX\nmalware, but also covered some previously undocumented malware families.\n\nThe Catholic Church has historically had a turbulent relationship with Chinese\nauthorities, where it was demanded that the Church could only operate within the strict\nguidelines of the Communist Party.\n\nIn recent years, Pope Francis has had a strong focus on the Catholic Church in Asia,\nwith numerous visits of countries in the region. At the same time, the Vatican has\nworked to improve affairs with the Chinese government. Since 2014, diplomatic talks\nhave been held over the thorny subject of appointment of bishops [5] [6], and finally in\n2018 the Vatican reached a provisional agreement with the Chinese government [7].\nThe deal was renewed for an additional two years in 2020.\n\nConsiderable criticism has been raised against the deal, citing concerns over the human\nrights situation in China and the crackdown on religious communities. [8]\n\nThis is the political context for the malware campaigns we will be detailing in this paper.\n\n2\n\n\n-----\n\n## CHAPTER 1:  THE LINKIPV6 PLUGX/POISONIVY CAMPAIGN (2014-2016) \n\n**Patient Zero**\n\nOn February 10, 2021, Norton antimalware technology detected the presence of a\nmalicious DLL on a user machine in France. This turned out to be a PlugX malware.\n\n**PlugX**\n\nPlugX is a well-known Chinese trojan used by a whole host of threat actors. It is usually\ndistributed as a package of several files. These files are composed to exploit a\nphenomenon called DLL search order hijacking (also called sideloading) [9].\n\nOne of the files in the bundle will be a legitimate program from a trusted software\nvendor. When this program is run, it attempts to load a Dynamic Link Library (DLL),\nwhich is a software component belonging to its own installation. The program will find a\nmalicious DLL with the same name, inadvertently loading that instead. The malware\nthus gets the unwitting help of a trusted executable to run. The malicious DLL then\ntypically loads an encrypted file from disk which contains the final payload.\n\nThere are many sideloader configurations used by malware (more than 60 that we’ve\nseen), and a lot of major software products by trusted vendors have historically been\nmisused this way. Most of these issues were fixed a long time ago, but old executables\nstill work and are still exploited by threat actors.\n\n**Sample found on user computer:**\n**sha256: 6b851e5b7d429f56a3fd7453314afc4b8c96cb3a702609cfba2545b0bbe15828**\n\nThis is a standard PlugX loader named vsodscpl.dll, designed to be loaded by a legitimate\n_scncgf32.exe from the McAfee VirusScan suite. We do not have the payload blob (named_\n_mcafee.lib) in this case. However, there is a complete dropper on VirusTotal (VT) for this exact_\nloader [10]. This dropper is configured to use the following Command & Control (C2) addresses:\n\n\nsg3appstore[.]net\nus3appstore[.]net\nbz3appstore[.]info\nmaildantri[.]org\n\n\nWhile we cannot be certain that the VT dropper was the one used in our case, there is good\nreason to believe the samples are related: Two of the C2 domains above are also used in\nPoisonIvy campaigns we will detail later. These overlap with Vatican-oriented activity.\n\n\n3\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition to that sample, we saw IPS events from the machine showing that it was reaching\nout to the following domain:\n\n\nlink.linkipv6[.]com\n\n\nData from VirusTotal showed that this C2 is connected to a large cluster of PlugX and PoisonIvy\nactivity, apparently targeting the Catholic Church and its activities in Asia. This cluster is much\nolder than previously reported Catholic-related targeting. Most of the samples were submitted\nto VT in 2016. However, the malicious loader DLL has a compilation timestamp from December\n2013, and the various lures appear to be mainly from 2014. More than 100 malware samples\nwere found to belong to this cluster. They tend to follow the same two basic designs as shown\nbelow, with just the lure documents differing between samples.\n\n4\n\n\n-----\n\n**Left: The dropper is a PE executable**\nwhich is named according to some\nchurch-related topic (in Italian.)\n\nIt extracts another executable called\n_wintmp01.exe to disk. In addition, a real_\ndocument is opened to stop the user\nfrom becoming suspicious.\nWintmp01.exe is a WinRAR SFX archive\ncontaining four files:\n\n_Hewlett.exe is a renamed legitimate_\n_hpqtax08.exe from Hewlett-Packard. It_\nloads the malicious hpqtap08.dll, which\nin turn loads the first of two binary\nshellcode blobs - msi.url. This contains\nan intermediate executable written in\nDelphi, which depending on the\nsituation attempts to load the final\nshellcode blob hp.url either directly or\nthrough thread injection mechanisms.\nOnce decoded, hp.url contains a classic\nearly PlugX executable.\n\n\n5\n\n\n-----\n\n**PoisonIvy**\n\nPoisonIvy (PI) was originally a “remote administration tool” developed by the Swedish\nhacker Shapeless in 2005, with several other contributors [11]. It was freely available on\nthe web and was quickly adopted by many threat actors because of its features. It is\nlightweight and supports being deployed as a small executable shellcode. PI injectors\nalso sometimes use sideloading.\n\n**Targeting**\n\nWe have little hard data on the actual targets for this campaign, but we can make highconfidence conclusions based on the topics and design of the lure documents.\n\n**Many lures follow a format that seems to adhere to the internal Vatican document**\n**standard:**\n\n_Above: Naming convention follows the scheme SEQUENCE_NUMBER/YEAR/ DEPARTMENT._\n_In our case, the ‘Department’ field is ‘RS’ (Rapporti con gli Stati - Relations with States). This is_\n_a report on anniversary celebrations for Pope Francis in Singapore._\n\n**Correspondence possibly directed at external recipients:**\n\n_Above: Notice of Papal Audience given to then Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra of Thailand._\n_The meeting indeed took place on Sept. 12[th], 2013 [12]_\n\n6\n\n\n-----\n\n**News reports taken from public sources:**\n\n_Above: A news story seemingly taken from AsiaNews [13]_\n\nMany of these lures seem to be either stolen legitimate documents, or documents\ndeliberately doctored to resemble official Vatican correspondence.\n\nAs mentioned, it is not evident which individuals were targeted by these malware\npackages.\n\nThere is a strong focus on the Church's activities pertaining to countries in the SouthEast Asia region: Vietnam, Thailand, Philippines, Japan, East Timor, and Singapore.\nHowever, since most of these lures are in Italian and often follow an apparent internal\nVatican communication format, it is reasonable to assume that the recipients are Italianspeaking representatives of the Holy See.\n\nA full document list is provided in the Appendix.\n\n7\n\n\n-----\n\n**Connections to other activity**\n\nThe wintmp01 PlugX and dc006 PoisonIvy droppers have a long history. There are\nseveral separate branches going back to at least 2014 mainly targeting Vietnam. These\nseem to be more focused on internal Vietnamese issues, and not specifically on\nreligious matters or the Vatican. In the case of PoisonIvy, the malware configuration\nusually contains a campaign tag that gives a hint as to which cluster they belong to.\n\nAbove: Similarity between the usb0712 Vietnamese campaign and the FDSTG Vatican\ncampaign. Note the *appstore[.]net domains, also used in the previously mentioned PlugX\ndropper [10].\n\nThe FerryTrojan loader used in some of the Vatican PoisonIvy samples is a common\nfactor among several other clusters of activity. The same is the case for the network\ninfrastructure used.\n\n8\n\n\n-----\n\n_Some historic connected cases_\n\n_The FerryTrojan PoisonIvy loader provides a link to more recent attacks._\n\n\n9\n\n\n-----\n\nVatican and Vietnamese PlugX and PoisonIvy campaigns are almost identical in\n1\nstructure.\n\nVatican PlugX activity using the C2 linkipv6[.]com overlaps on IP with Mongolian\n2\nPlugX activity at lookipv6[.]com [14] [15].\n\nThe breach of the Vietnamese travel agency JTB and subsequent user data leak\n3\nwas reportedly done using FerryTrojan PlugX over the C2’s vietnanmonline[.]com\nand vatgla[.]com. [16]\n\nFerryTrojan PoisonIvy samples were used in a campaign against Philippines Air\n4\nForce.\n\nThere are 100+ associated samples that reach out to the associated C2 [17],\ncomplete with lure documents.\n\nThe cdncool[.]com domain is used for both FerryTrojan PoisonIvy, as well as\n5\nPlugX, Farseer and Henbox. [18] [19] [20]\n\n10\n\n\n-----\n\n## CHAPTER 2:  THE VATICAN INTRUSIONS (2019-2020)\n\nThroughout 2019, Norton researchers detected abnormal activity in telemetry data\noriginating from computers located in the Vatican. Closer inspection of the logs revealed\nthat a handful of computers had several clearly malicious implants installed. Some of\nthese belonged to previously known families such as PlugX while others had not been\npublicly documented before.\n\nA total of 17 computers showed signs of intrusion to varying degrees. In this paper, we\nwill be referring to these as machines A to Q.\n\nThis activity revolves around a main command and control hub located at the IP\naddresses 192.225.226[.]123 and 192.225.226[.]217. Over time, these addresses have\nbeen used to control malware installations spread over at least four different families.\n\n11\n\n\n-----\n\nThe other computers we identified contained these and a few malware families to\ndifferent degrees.\n\n\n12\n\n\n-----\n\n## PLUGX\n\nThe PlugX installers in this case have been of different types, which suggests that the\nattackers have an arsenal of different malware builders at their disposal.\n\n**Sample:**\n**sha256: f96adc9e046ecc6f22d3ba9cfea47a4af75bcba369f454b7a9c8d7ca3d423ac4**\n\nThis is a bundled installer executable which contains the legitimate application\nptwatchdog.exe renamed to msvsct.exe, a malicious TmDbgLog.dll and an encrypted\nPlugX executable payload named TmDbgLog.dll.obj. The installer extracts and\nexecutes a Visual Basic script (msvvcs.vbs) which in turn extracts the other\ncomponents.\n\nThe PlugX payload is decoded by XOR’ing each byte with 0xbb and subtracting 1.\n\nCommand-and-control (C2) servers are 192.225.226[.]123 and 192.225.226[.]217.\n\nSeveral other PlugX loader DLLs were seen on the affected computers, though without\nthe original dropper and payload. Without these we cannot be certain about the\nspecifics of the malware. Some of the DLLs have instead shown up in full dropper\npackages on VirusTotal and while these have not necessarily been used against\nVatican targets, it is likely that there is some connection between them. For example:\n\n**Loader sha256:**\nad48650c6ab73e2f94b706e28a1b17b2ff1af1864380edc79642df3a47e579bb\n**Dropper sha256:**\n0a00204517283c9a8d1e2d1a8743249c14de0edcec4a8292500083437735663c\n**Dropper sha256:**\n75f2e752983a9f46082e7b35820f23db577a5aff9ad946b05b0d3871a9df686b\n\nThese are very similar to the dropper above, though they are WinRAR self-extracting\nexecutables (SFX), not bundled installers.\n\nC2 servers are:\nlib.hostareas[.]com and 123.1.151[.]64\nweb.miscrosaft[.]com and 154.213.21[.]207\n\n13\n\n\n-----\n\n**Loader sha256:**\n29b5ffcda77acf5d1d14f8e1e57d2bed803dd493863377fdf48b3ca97126bdde\n\nThis is an impersonation of HPCustPartUI.dll from Hewlett-Packard. It uses a different\nloader logic from the previous configuration (no VBS script and payload is encoded\nusing the assembly instructions [sub 0x71, xor 0xb5, add 0x71]). The payload is named\n_HPCustPartic.UI._\n\nSeveral droppers are available that incorporate this loader:\n\n**Dropper sha256:**\n3f46de9df24fd146d75c906663e8f1ace300b147f0cea0370f38cb0088a158a4\n**Dropper sha256:**\n6537fcbb157bde7acabc3a1a8bef266d7825573ed5ecee1408c495db3c913c60\n**Dropper sha256:**\nade0514ccb90c39a61ab8a4c16818fbcd352984e2a26b2ffcd92165975e07fd5\nAll of these are configured to use 192.225.226[.]217 and/or 192.225.226[.]123 as C2\nservers.\n\n**Loader sha256:**\n653fe0ab7b634e50ba09f962c6357bcf76ce633768aa41dd01d1a93ef83a0a54\n\nThis is an impersonation of comserv.dll from Rising Information Technology.\n\nThe dropper also contains the legitimate executable RStray.exe as well as the payload\n_comserv.dll.url. The payload is not decoded before being called, but the code is_\nobfuscated.\n\n**Dropper sha256:**\n8c16116b95b94511c3dfe5aa1fdb05078a88747bbd2ef9ebe305f90f1bbf604a\nC2 server: 192.225.226[.]152\n\n14\n\n\n-----\n\n## ZUPDAX\n\nThis remote access trojan has been in use since at least early 2014, but it has managed\nto stay under the radar of the security community, apart from a brief mention in two\nreports. [18] [20]\n\nThe malware has evolved over time, as has the functionality it offers. The version used\nin our case is apparently the same as described by the Korean security vendor Hauri in\nHauri Security Magazine [21] in 2018. Like PlugX, this malware often uses DLL\nsideloading as a part of the infection process.\n\n**The Zupdax “P1Rat” installer**\n\nThe initial dropper is a bundled installer we have called the “P1Rat” variant due to the\ninstaller and included loader DLL containing the following debug paths:\n\nD:\\Leee\\515远程文件\\P1Rat_2017_07_28A\\src\\MyLoaderBypassNorton\\Release\\loaderexe.pdb\n\nD:\\Leee\\515远程文件\\P1Rat_2017_07_28A\\src\\MyLoader_bypassKIS\\snake\\res\\SiteAdv.pdb\n\nThe following files exist as resources in the installer:\n\n**Resource #** **Installed filename Description**\n103 siteadv.exe Legitimate and signed Mcafee Siteadvisor\nExecutable\n105 siteadv.dll Malicious loader DLL\n106 ok.obj RC4-encrypted payload (key: ”GoogleMailData”)\n107 n/a Configuration data XOR 0x64\n\nResources 103, 105 and 106 are extracted to disk using the above names, and\nsiteadv.exe is executed. This causes the malicious sideadv.dll to be loaded.\n\nSideadv.dll contain its own copy of the configuration resource. The config data contains:\n\n  - Names of executables\n\n  - Installation path\n\n  - Name of the encrypted payload\n\n  - Main payload export function to call\n\n  - Whether payload will be loaded from disk or memory\n\n  - Registry install key\n\n  - Installation check mutex name\n\n15\n\n\n-----\n\nSiteadv.dll will be loaded with one of four possible parameters:\n\nInstall Install loader exe in registry run key and load payload\n(from file or memory)\nRun Load a decrypted payload dll file from disk and call its\nexport function. Name of dll and export is defined in\nconfig resource\nMrun Decrypt and load payload dll file to memory and call its\nexport function. Name of dll and export is defined in\nconfig resource\nInstall_and_del Install loader exe in registry run key and load payload\nfrom memory, as well as delete a file (typically the\ninstaller)\n\n**The “Boar” and “Badger” installers**\n\nZupdax has previously been distributed in other installers going by the names “Boar”\nand “Badger”. As far as we know, these have not been used in the Vatican campaign(s),\nbut we mention them here for completeness.\n\n“Boar” executables have contained the following debug paths:\n\nd:\\tenshine\\The Boar\\bin\\install.pdb\nd:\\tenshine\\The Boar\\bin\\ushata.pdb\ne:\\workspace\\boar服务生成用byebye.exe过uac\\bin\\install.pdb\n\ne:\\workspace\\boar服务生成用byebye.exe过uac\\bin\\ushata.pdb\n\ne:\\workspace\\boar服务生成用byebye.exe过uac\\bin\\byebye.pdb\n\ne:\\workspace\\boar服务生成用byebye.exe过uac\\bin\\SvcDll.pdb\n\ne:\\workspace\\boar服务生成用byebye.exe过uac\\bin\\install_test.pdb\n\ne:\\workspace\\boar服务生成用byebye.exe过uac\\bin\\ushata_noload.pdb\n\ne:\\workspace\\boar服务生成用byebye.exe过uac\\bin\\test.pdb\n\nInstead of containing payload components as resources, Boar incorporates these as\nencoded and compressed blobs in the installer file. These are extracted and installed\naccording to information in an INI file. Where “P1Rat” spoofs siteadv.dll for sideloading,\n“Boar” spoofs ushata.dll, a Kaspersky component. The malicious DLL is inadvertently\nloaded by the signed legitimate Kaspersky executable avpui.exe which is also included\nin the installer.\n\nThe “Badger” installer is structurally similar to the “P1Rat” installer, down to the using\nthe same resource structure and the same RC4 password for the payload decryption.\nThe PDB string is:\n_c:\\Users\\PC-2015\\Desktop\\Badger\\En-v2\\免杀\\MyLoader_bypassKIS\\bin\\loaderdll.pdb_\n\n16\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware associated with this installer is a trojanized Able Desktop installation. This\nsample was previously detailed by ESET [26], described as dropping PlugX aka\nKorplug. The payload does however appear to be Zupdax. The campaign in that case\nwas seemingly aimed at Mongolian targets and was attributed to LuckyMouse aka\nEmissary Panda/APT27 or alternatively a threat actor known as TA428.\n\n**Zupdax main payload**\n\nThe payload is a PE DLL executable of approximately 300kb, written in C++. It exports\none function named load.\n\nThe malware utilizes the open-source library UDT for network communication. UDT is\ndescribed as a “UDP based application-level data transport protocol for distributed data\n_intensive applications over wide area high-speed networks.” [22]_\n\nThe malware will in some configurations try to disguise this as legitimate traffic by\nconnecting to port 53 (DNS) on the command & control server, as well as deliberately\nnaming the C2 domains with the ns* (nameserver) prefix. Data transferred is encrypted\nusing RC4 with the encryption key “Microsoft”.\n\nZupdax has historical connections to several other targeted operations which will be\nbriefly covered below.\n\nThe variant used in the Vatican campaign supports the following commands:\n\nCommand Action\n0x0 Stop all actions and deinstall service\n0x17 Save data to file\n0x19 Deinstall service\n0x29 Verify received plugin and call its export function “Fu**ME”. (Export name\nis a profanity slightly redacted. It is case insensitive, any case combination\nis loaded)\n0x38 Download and execute file\n0x68 Start program named AVANTI.EXE (this is usually the loader executable)\n\n17\n\n\n-----\n\n## NEWBOUNCE\n\nThis malware is a backdoor that also includes rootkit components.\n\n\nThe name “NewBounce” is derived from the PDB path included in several\nsamples:\n```\nf:\\sj\\newbounce\\hidefile\\amd64\\mhide64.pdb\nF:\\sj\\newbounce\\Release\\setup3.pdb\n\n```\nThe string “bounce” is also present as debug messages found in the code; such\nas “Run bounce” and “work bounce Mode ”\n\n\n**Installer** **sha256:**\n5e3d5f7d04ed48f27652f21d72c5915be147d0dd5bf0e92f1c26b38d5f4e1d7a\n\nThis is a simple installer that checks system architecture (x32/x64) and installs the\ncorrect service DLL accordingly. The DLLs are copied from existing files present on disk\nnamed MSVC3.DAT and MSVC6.DAT.\n\n**Service DLL:**\n\nThe service DLL contains the main functionality of the malware. It contains the following\nfeatures:\n\n  - It can connect to up to three different download servers (optionally via proxy) and\n\ndownload a shellcode blob embedded in a JPG file. The file will be named\n“out.jpg” on disk.\nThe last four bytes of the JPG indicate the offset in the file where the code blob\nstarts. This code is LZ-compressed and is read into memory and decompressed\nbefore being called.\n\n  - Upon installation it collects basic descriptive data about the target computer,\n\nsuch as Windows version, computer name, system language and ansi code\npage, drive types and free disk space, username, memory status, CPU type and\nRDP port and uploads these to C2 server.\n\n  - The malware sets up AES-encrypted command&control communications using\n\nthe key phrase:\n\n“GAEncryptfasdfafhhIlove!!@#$!@$!@$#%!asdfasdfasdfsdfaasdfaasdfasfsafasdf\n_asdfdasfdasfjjjvzcxvjzjdfasdfasdfsadfasfsdafdasfasdfasfd”_\n\n  - The message handling loop responds to commands from operator. Features\n\ninclude uploading and downloading of files, opening a command shell, listing files\nand processes, copying and deleting files.\n\n18\n\n\n-----\n\nThe DLL is installed in the %system% folder using names like twain.dll or bingsvc.dll,\nand registry entries are added to load it:\n\n_Registry\\Machine\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\twain_\n\n**Sample: File hider rootkit component**\nsha256 96c0a4bde1d8fedd58215f91d3aaa49e65fb44275ecb15302ebabfc02350c47b\n\nWhen first executed, NewBounce installs a rootkit minifilter driver and calls this to hide\nfiles related to the malware. This rootkit driver is installed in the drivers folder using the\nfile name “hfile_device.sys”. The driver subscribes to IRP_MJ_DIRECTORY_CONTROL\nevents (0xC) via a postprocessing callback and checks the file name returned against\nits own list of file names. If the name is found in the list, the directory entry is ignored\nand thus never appears in ordinary directory/folder listings.\n\nUserland applications interacting with this rootkit can add new file name strings to the\nhidden files list by calling the driver through DeviceIoControl with IOControlCode\n0x22E024. Sending the string “CLEAR ALL” instead of a filename will empty the list.\n\nThe file is digitally signed using a code certificate issued to 上海域联软件技术有限公司 – or\nShanghai Yulian Software Technology Co., Ltd. This certificate is almost certainly\nshared in the underground. A large amount of different malware is signed with it and it\nhas been used in multiple cyberattacks [23] [24]. It was originally valid only until 2012\nand has also been revoked.\n\nThis file hider rootkit is identical between the different NewBounce samples we have\nseen in the Vatican case.\n\nInterestingly, the service also tries to invoke two other rootkit drivers to hide registry\nentries and network connections. These drivers are called PCI358129.SYS and\nNSIP.SYS, but they are not dropped by any of the malware samples in the Vatican\nintrusion. Without the drivers installed, the calls to them will simply fail.\n\nHowever, we found an earlier NewBounce sample which does drop drivers matching\nthe descriptions. They have similar names, PDB paths and are signed with the same\ncertificate as the file hider, but at least the registry hider does not appear to be fully\nfinished.\n\n\nf:\\sj\\wfpga\\hidereg\\amd64\\hidereg64.pdb\nf:\\sj\\wfpga\\nsiproxy\\amd64\\nsiproxy64.pdb\n\n\n**Sample: NewBounce dropper**\nsha256: c425e30a202f00b9d272bc864965ad9087c1596466f842871121c523b47638c2\n**Sample: Network hider rootkit component**\nsha256 ddb6bc2db796885a3e706c99918a8e3ba80826a9813ead7cb6b9999e1cae4b7f\n\n19\n\n\n-----\n\n**Sample: Registry hider rootkit component**\nsha256 cec59ba4fe49f48332f2a60df7ebb72ac86e6049b8ec09b0aa2bd9c9214e112e\n**Sample: Controller**\nsha256: 6156ca511faca6ca9ff08263157df5c8cb77f7dbbb08950d59159ce4331a4fcf\n\nSomeone submitted what appears to be a NewBounce controller to VirusTotal.

The\nembedded shellcode is responsible for dropping the payload and establishing\npersistence on the system.\n\n  - Injects code to svchost\n\n  - Drops payload to system32 directory\n\n  - Establishes persistence by installing as a SSP DLL in\n\"HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Lsa\\Security Packages\"\n\n  - The payload is an unencrypted DLL inside of the shellcode.\n\n**Payload:**\n\nThe payload DLL contains the main credential stealer with the capability to send the\nusername and password to the C&C server. It is installed as a password filter DLL.\n\nWe have seen two hardcoded names for the payload:\n\nkavsrvc.dll\nwmvdmooe3.dll\n\nDepending on the included configuration the stolen credentials can be saved to a file on disk,\ntransmitted to C2 via UDP over port 53, or they can be sent via HTTP POST.\nOur samples connect over HTTP to hxxp://mail.chin-coj[.]com/mskmsonemissio.php.\nUsernames and passwords are encrypted and base64 encoded and concatenated with \"flag=\"\neg. \"flag=base64encode(encrypt(username[password]))\".\n\n\n21\n\n\n-----\n\n## SERVER007\n\nThis is a backdoor written in C++. It appears to have been in development at\ndeployment time because it contains a lot of debug statements. We have seen both 32and 64-bit versions, but only the installed DLL – we do not have copies of the dropper.\nThis malware has been one of the most commonly found on targeted machines (11/17).\n\nIt is installed as a service in the Windows System folder, and when run, it sets up\ncommunication with C2 server over HTTP. Network traffic is LZ-compressed and\nbase64 encoded.\n\nThe malware profiles the local system and uploads the data to C2. This includes:\n\n  - Local hostname/ip\n\n  - Computer name\n\n  - System language ID\n\n  - System ANSI code page\n\n  - Windows Version (Major and Minor Versions, Build number, Platform ID)\n\n  - Drive types\n\n  - Free disk space\n\n  - Default RDP port\n\nIt then sets up a command loop that can:\n\n  - run local shells\n\n  - list files/folders\n\n  - delete files\n\n  - rename files\n\n  - upload and download files\n\n  - execute local commands\n\nThe name Server_007 stems from a string present in many samples which appears to\nbe a campaign tag or similar. This string is also included in the data sent back to C2 but\nis otherwise not used. The most prevalent such tag is “server_007” and is probably the\ndefault value. Two samples contain the tag “ppoomm” here, which is similar to\nwww.ppoomm[.]va, the website of “Pontificie Opere Missionarie” aka the Pontifical\nMission Societies. We do not have individual target information apart from affected\ncomputers being geographically located in the Vatican, so we do not know if this is\nmeaningful.\n\n22\n\n\n-----\n\n## SPARKLE\n\nSparkle is another malware that has been in development for quite some time.\nVariations go back to at early 2015. This malware was briefly mentioned and given the\nname Sparkle in a 2019 article by BlackBerry Cylance Threatvector Team [25]. We saw\nSparkle used on three computers (A, B, P) in our cluster.\n\nIt is typically installed as a DLL by an executable dropper. The dropper is responsible\nfor extracting the DLL from an LZ-compressed blob and execute it via rundll32.exe. It\nwill add a registry run key for persistence.\n\n\nHCKU\\Software\\ts\\explorer\\run Adobe =\n%SYSTEM%\\rundll32.exe %TEMP%\\Adobe_FlashUpdate.dll Start\n\n\nAlternatively, a shortcut file - “Internet Explorer.lnk” - with the same function may be\nplaced in the %STARTUP% folder.\n\nOnce installed, the main payload connects back to C2 server and sets up\ncommunication. Early variants use regular unencrypted (but LZ-compressed) TCP traffic\nfor this, while newer variants send this information over HTTP.\nThere is some variation between versions, but usually the features include:\n\n  - List system drives\n\n  - List files\n\n  - Delete files\n\n  - Execute CMD statements\n\n  - Copy & move files\n\n  - Upload files to a remote server\n\n  - Download files from a remote server\n\nAs with several other malwares in this investigation, some Sparkle samples also contain\nnoteworthy PDB strings:\n\nF:\\六道\\Obiit-IV\\Release\\svchost_1.pdb\nF:\\六道\\Obiit-III\\Release\\Install_New.pdb\nF:\\六道\\Obiit-IV\\Release\\Install_New.pdb\n\nE:\\六道\\HTTP探针远程取证软件\\Release\\Install_New.pdb\nC:\\Users\\123\\Desktop\\Obiit-YY\\Obiit-III-2.000\\Release\\Install_New.pdb\nC:\\Users\\Bala\\Desktop\\Obiit-III\\Release\\Install_New.pdb\nF:\\666666\\Obiit-III-SD\\Release\\Install_New.pdb\n\n_Based on the PDB strings, the project seems to have been named “Obiit” – or_\n_alternatively “六道“ – “six ways”, possibly referring to the six stages of Buddhist_\n_existence._\n\n23\n\n\nF:\\六道\\Obiit-IV\\Release\\svchost_1.pdb\nF:\\六道\\Obiit-III\\Release\\Install_New.pdb\nF:\\六道\\Obiit-IV\\Release\\Install_New.pdb\n\nE:\\六道\\HTTP探针远程取证软件\\Release\\Install_New.pdb\nC:\\Users\\123\\Desktop\\Obiit-YY\\Obiit-III-2.000\\Release\\Install_New.pdb\nC:\\Users\\Bala\\Desktop\\Obiit-III\\Release\\Install_New.pdb\nF:\\666666\\Obiit-III-SD\\Release\\Install_New.pdb\n\n\n-----\n\n## GRAVY INJECTOR\n\nThis is a simple injector that starts nslookup.exe and loads a malicious DLL into the\nnslookup process. We do not have a copy of this payload DLL, but it is named\n“MsPEng.dll” on disk.\n\nThe injector’s PDB string gives a hint at what the functionality is supposed to be:\nC:\\Users\\enWin7x64\\Desktop\\GravityProxyXE\\x64InjectDll\\MsPEng\\x64\\Release\\MsPE\nng.pdb\n\nIt is likely that the payload is a proxy of some sort. To avoid naming collision with an\nunrelated malware already named “Gravity”, we have named this malware “Gravy”.\n\n24\n\n\n-----\n\n## CONNECTIONS TO OTHER ACTIVITY\n\nThe malware and network infrastructure used by the threat actors in this incident has\noverlaps with other current and historical activity from China-related groups.\n\nA PlugX dropper\n1\n6537fcbb157bde7acabc3a1a8bef266d7825573ed5ecee1408c495db3c913c60\nconfigured with a C2 used against the Vatican was sent as email attachment to\nKorean recipients.\n\n2 A PlugX dropper\nade0514ccb90c39a61ab8a4c16818fbcd352984e2a26b2ffcd92165975e07fd5\nconfigured with a C2 used against the Vatican appears to refer to a Belgian\nCatholic organization.\n\n3 A Zupdax sample was involved in campaigns apparently against Mongolian\ntargets [26]. Final payload is structurally very similar to a sample used against the\nVatican, though it is almost two years newer.\n\n\nMongolia sha256:\n07f87f7b3313acd772f77d35d11fc12d3eb7ca1a2cd7e5cef810f9fb657694a0\nVatican sha256:\nf56d87a87b52e86e669fb9b01e28caa8817e83a6fb8e1873faec70b15ae6bb72\n\n\nAn old Zupdax sample was at a point in time hosted on a Cambodian\n4\ngovernment website.\n\nsha256:\n9fa51060685808ab72ab9f862ced67241306c5fd927ae28c17252bac6cbf9354\nC2: mail.vip53[.]cn\n\nThe same host served other malicious content apparently related to Cambodia\n\n[27].\n\n5 A Zupdax sample is configured to use C2 servers that have been associated with\nFF-Rat activity [28]. This sample is structurally identical and has the same\ncompile time as the Vatican Zupdax sample.\n\n\nsha256:\n84b8bfe8161da581a88c0ac362318827d4c28edb057e23402523d3c93a5b3429\nC2: pop.playdr2[.]com|mail.playdr2[.]com|ns2.gamepoer7[.]com\n\n\nFF-Rat aka FormerFirstRat has been attributed to the group known as DragonOk\nor Bronze Overbrook [29].\n\n25\n\n\n-----\n\nNewBounce samples are configured to use C2 servers that have been\n6\nassociated with the threat group Mustang Panda aka Bronze President [2] [30],\nand have also been mentioned in the context of RedDelta [31].\n\nsha256:\nd6f468c274536c6ce2705d2780b44b52d5d27d7614cae10ea57dc1689e703ba1\nC2: mail.svrchost[.]com|host.svchosts[.]com\n\nsha256:\n5298bf36c489af136bcb69f9eb8d7700606006e3f702af771a9c0c74d784401b\nC2: lib.hostareas[.]com\n\n\nThe RedDelta activity was also reported used against Hong Kong Catholic\ntargets [2].\n\n\nMost of our Server007 samples were compiled January 2019 and connect to the\n7\nC2 server at the IP address 45.192.160[.]214. Throughout early 2020 this IP\nshared SSL certificate with another IP address at 154.213.21[.]70. This IP hosted\nthe domain lib.jsquerys[.]net - a similar domain name configuration as the\nNewBounce C2 lib.hostareas[.]com.\n\nThese domains were also documented used for other RedDelta activity [31],\nincluding the use of Cobalt Strike.\n\nThe Gravy injector sample contains traits found in other malware.\n8\n\nsha256:\n0253e700764a008b2e724e1d24718594ff8ff4b138298b5a0d79f0a42503938f\nThe first pdb string segments: “C:\\Users\\enWin7x64\\Desktop\\...”\n\nare identical to pdb strings found in these samples:\n\nsha256:\n5c2a6b11d876c5bad520ff9e79be44dfbb05ee6a6ff300e8427deab35085bef6\nsha256:\n9bac74c592a36ee249d6e0b086bfab395a37537ec87c2095f999c00b946ae81d\n\n\nThese samples have been associated with supply chain attacks on the gaming\nindustry as well as other targeted attacks against Vietnamese entities [32] [33],\nand have also been associated with Vatican attacks [2]. The PDB strings are\nhowever quite generic.\n\n\nThe P1Rat loader used for Zupdax has been used to install other malware –\n9\nnotably Rshell, another previously undocumented backdoor.\n\nsha256:\nb1d6ba4d995061a0011cb03cd821aaa79f0a45ba2647885171d473ca1a38c098\n\n\n26\n\n\n-----\n\nRshell uses the RC4 password “GoogleMailData” for its configuration data, same\nas the password used for the encrypted payload and the P1Rat Zupdax\npayloads. [34]\n\nThe targets appear to be Russian or Russian speaking, and one of the droppers\nrefers to the Russian aerospace entity ROSCOSMOS.\n\n\nSparkle samples share C2 infrastructure with Henbox/Farseer clusters via the C2\n10\nwww.sunleon[.]com. This is the second link between Henbox activity and the\nVatican campaigns.\n\n27\n\n\n-----\n\n## CONCLUSION\n\nThe targeting of persons connected to the Roman Catholic Church has been ongoing\nsince at least 2014. In Chapter 1 we detailed campaigns that appeared to target Italianspeaking persons likely connected to the Vatican. In Chapter 2 we detailed intrusions\nseen on computers inside the Vatican City.\n\nWe assess the following with high confidence:\n\n  - The 2014-2016 PlugX and PoisonIvy campaigns against Vatican and\n\nVietnamese targets were performed by the same threat actors. There are\nmultiple close overlaps in toolsets and infrastructure.\n\n  - The 2018-2020 Vatican intrusion activity is linked with previous reporting on the\n\nthreat actors RedDelta and Mustang Panda. [2] [31] . There are multiple\ninfrastructure overlaps.\n\nWe assess the following with medium confidence:\n\n  - The two cases are likely linked and performed by the same or cooperating\n\ngroups. There are overlaps in toolset preferences, targeting, and at least one\ninfrastructure/unique malware contact point.\n\nSeveral names for the threat actors have been used. Recorded Future introduced the\nname RedDelta, while noting that the group overlaps with the previously known group\nMustang Panda. We have chosen not to distinguish between these groups.\nThere are many connections to other intrusion activity, both historic and more current.\nThis is nothing new for this region and there appears to be a great deal of resource\nsharing between groups, and some groups appear to have wide-ranging interests.\nWe do not expect the attacks against the Catholic Church to end as long as it continues\nto engage with and influence the lives of people in China and other South East Asian\ncountries.\n\nIn today’s open world, one should expect targeting of all sorts of interest groups and\nindividuals, not only targets associated with governments and corporations.\n\n28\n\n\n-----\n\n## PROTECTION STATEMENT\n\nNorton protection products detect and remove the malware described in
