This assessment is based on malicious\ndocuments believed to have been delivered by Lazarus during the last few months (spring 2021). However, historical analysis shows\nthe lures used in this campaign to be in line with others used to target these groups.\n\nThe purpose of this blog is to share the new technical intelligence and provide detection options for defenders. Alien Labs will continue\nto report on any noteworthy changes.\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\nLazarus has been identified targeting defense contractors with malicious documents.\n[There is a high emphasis on renaming system utilities (Certutil and Explorer) to obfuscate the adversary’s activities (T1036.003).](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/003/)\n\n## Background\n\nSince 2009, the known tools and capabilities believed to have been used by the Lazarus Group include DDoS botnets, keyloggers,\nremote access tools (RATs), and drive wiper malware. The most publicly documented malware and tools used by the group actors\ninclude Destover, Duuzer, and Hangman.\n\n## Analysis\n\nSeveral documents identified from May to June 2021 by Twitter users were identified as being linked to the Lazarus group. Documents\nobserved in previous campaigns lured victims with job opportunities for Boeing and BAE systems. These new documents include:\n\n\n-----\n\n_[Rheinmetall_job_requirements.doc: identified by ESET Research.](https://twitter.com/esetresearch/status/1389904254811394049)_\n_[General_motors_cars.doc: identified by Twitter user @1nternaut.](https://twitter.com/1nternaut/status/1394050982632468481)_\n_[Airbus_job_opportunity_confidential.doc: identified by 360CoreSec.](https://twitter.com/360CoreSec/status/1402920149754155010)_\n\nThe documents attempted to impersonate new defense contractors and engineering companies like Airbus, General Motors (GM), and\nRheinmetall. All of these documents contain macro malware, which has been developed and improved during the course of this\ncampaign and from one target to another. The core techniques for the three malicious documents are the same, but the attackers\nattempted to reduce the potential detections and increase the faculties of the macros.\n\n## First iteration: Rheinmetall\n\nThe first two documents from early May 2021 were related to a German Engineering company focused on the defense and automotive\nindustries, Rheinmetall. The second malicious document appears to include more elaborate content, which may have resulted in the\ndocuments going unnoticed by victims.\n\nThe Macro has base64 encoded files, which are extracted and decoded during execution. Some of the files are split inside the Macro\nand are not combined until the time of decoding. One of the most distinctive characteristics of this Macro is how it evades detections of\na MZ header encoded in base64 (TVoA, TVpB, TVpQ, TVqA, TVqQ or TVro), by separating the first two characters from the rest of the\ncontent, as seen in Figure 1.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1: Concealing of MZ header, as captured by Alien Labs.\n\nThe rest of the content is kept together in lines of 64 characters, and because of this, YARA rules can be used to detect other, typical\nexecutable content encoded in base64 aside of the MZ header. In this case, up to nine different YARA rules alerted to suspicious\nencoded strings in our Alien Labs analysis, like VirtualProtect, GetProcAddress, IsDebuggerPresent, GetCurrentProcessId, etc.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2: YARA rules detections listed in the AT&T Alien Labs Open Threat Exchange, OTX.\n\nAll files created by the executable and used by the different Macros are located in a new folder C:/Drivers with the purpose of\nmasquerading their activity. The Macro copies and renames the Microsoft legitimate executable Certutil.exe into this folder. The reason\nfor this copy is to avoid endpoint detection and response (EDR) signatures based on system utilities executed from non-standard\nsources (a Microsoft Office document in this case). Additionally, the copy of Certutil is disguised to avoid using the full string, by\npartially replacing it with an asterisk %systemroot%\\system32\\certut*.exe. As seen in later iterations, this technique was slightly\nmodified to further reduce the number of detections.\n\nCertutil is used to decode the previously mentioned file, doing it within the same folder and with a different executable name. Once the\nnecessary files have been decoded, the encoded files are removed from the system.\n\nThe script queries WMI to list all the explorer.exe processes, where it will try to inject the malicious payload. For the injection, the\nattackers used Mavinject (a legitimate Windows component that can be used and abused) to perform arbitrary code injections inside\n[any running process. Mavinject.exe has been abused for several years, as indicated in this blog from 2017.](https://reaqta.com/2017/12/mavinject-microsoft-injector/)\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3: Mavinject injection to explorer, as captured by Alien Labs.\n\nFigure 4: Malicious Document execution tree listed in the AT&T Alien Labs OTX.\n\nThe payload is in fact a downloader, which requests the next stage to a hardcoded Command and Control (C&C) server and saves it to a\nnew file. This request is made through HTTPS with hardcoded headers. In this case, the domain used as C&C has been registered for\nseveral years, and the domain continues to have a long expiration date. For these reasons, this domain was assessed as a compromised\ndomain, leveraged by Lazarus as C&C.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5: Hardcoded HTTP headers, as captured by Alien Labs.\n\n## Second iteration: General Motors\n\nA few weeks after the Rheinmetall document was observed, a very similar document emerged targeting General Motors. The\ncharacteristics of this document were very similar to the previous one, but with minor updates in the C&C communication process.\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter attempting to execute all its code, the Macro reports back to the C&C server with the status of the infection. In the code, a variable\nis updated from 1 to 3, signaling the status of the execution. The C&C is capable of tracking where its execution is failing, or\nencountering unexpected behavior, based on the requests made to the different documents in the C&C. This includes:\n\n1. During copying, decoding, renaming and executing the payload\n2. After successfully executing the payload\n3. After (and if) the payload was able to contact the C&C and download a file which is saved in the C:\\Drivers folder with the inf\n\nextension.\n\nThe status report to the C&C also requests the lure document, which at this moment is downloaded from the same C&C and opened.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6: C&C beacon to report execution status, as captured by Alien Labs.\n\nThe domain used in this document and payload allgraphicart[.]com is no longer a compromised domain. It was first registered on April\n1, 2021. However, it did not have any noteworthy activity until these malicious documents showed up, at least a month after the\ndomain was registered. The domain was registered with Porkbun LLC, who offers domains with the free option of protecting the whois\ninformation.\n\n## Third iteration: Airbus\n\nIn early June, a month after the first document of this campaign was observed, a new document was identified targeting Airbus. This\ntime, the C&C communications were very similar to the previous iteration of the document; however, the execution and injection\nprocesses were different.\n\nThis document continues utilizing and masquerading Certutil, but the copy command had the minor addition of another asterisk to\nreduce the detection risk: %systemroot%\\system32\\*ertut*.exe. In addition to Certutil, the legitimate explorer executable is copied to\nthe C:\\Drivers folder through a similar method %systemroot%\\exp*.exe. As previously mentioned, these files will be copied and\nrenamed to avoid EDR signature-based detections, but this time the destination filenames were carefully chosen. If alphabetically\nordered, the first two files will correspond to legitimate software, followed by the malicious files, which could mislead investigators on\ntheir first peak on the C:\\Drivers folder.\n\nThis Macro contains three files encoded with base64 which are copied to disk and decoded during execution:\n\nThe first .tmp file will become a .lnk file after decoding. This lnk file is executed with Explorer and performs the next decoding.\nThe second tmp file is concatenated (linked) with a third one, from the next-stage payload after decoding.\n\nAfter the actions, the Macro executes the mentioned payload with an updated technique. The attackers are no longer using Mavinject,\nbut directly executing the payload with explorer.exe, significantly modifying the resulting execution tree as seen in Figure 10. Once the\npayload has been executed, the Macro waits for three seconds before creating of an .inf file in the same folder. Whether it was\nsuccessfully executed or not, the Macro will proceed to send the beacon to the C&C with the execution status and delete all the\ntemporary files, attempting to clean their tracks. The only files left in C:\\Drivers\\ at this point are the payload and the .inf file.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7: Malicious Document execution tree, as captured by AT&T Alien Labs.\n\nThe new C&C shopweblive[.]com follows the same pattern and characteristics of the one used in the second iteration.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n\n-----\n\nThe reported activity remains in line with the Lazarus’ past campaigns and is not expected to be the last. Attack lures, potentially\ntargeting engineering professionals in government organizations, showcase the importance of tracking Lazarus and their evolution. We\ncontinue to see Lazarus using the same tactic, techniques, and procedures that we have observed in the past, such as using Microsoft\nOffice documents that download remote templates, Microsoft Office Macros, and compromised third party infrastructure to host the\npayloads and proxy C&C traffic through. AT&T Alien Labs will continue to monitor and report on any noteworthy changes.\n\n## Detection Methods\n\nThe following associated detection methods are in use by Alien Labs. They can be used by readers to tune or deploy detections in their\nown environments or for aiding additional research.\n\nSURICATA IDS SIGNATURES\n\n2033135: ET TROJAN Observed Lazarus Maldoc CnC Domain (shopweblive .com in TLS SNI)\n\nTDR / MTDR CORRELATION RULES\n\nMalicious activity detected after Certutil.exe file decoding\n\nWindows renamed binary\n\nSuspicious Process Created by Microsoft Office Application\n\nWindows MavInject DLL Injection\n\n\n-----\n\nYARA RULES\n```\nrule LazarusCampaign_MacroDoc_Jun2021 : WindowsMalware {\n\n  meta:\n\n   author = \"AlienLabs\"\n\n   description = \"Detects Lazarus campaign macro document Jun2021.\"\n\n   reference =\n\"https://otx.alienvault.com/pulse/294acafed42c6a4f546486636b4859c074e53d74be049df99932804be048f42c\"\n\n   SHA256 = \"294acafed42c6a4f546486636b4859c074e53d74be049df99932804be048f42c\"\n\n  strings:\n\n   $a1 = \"ZSBydW4gaW4gRE9TIG1vZGUuDQ0KJA\" ascii //run in DOS mode. - base64 encoded\n\n   $a2 = \"c:\\\\Drivers\"\n\n   $a3 = \"AAAAAAAAAA=\" ascii // base64 content\n\n   $a4 = \"CreateObject(\\\"Scripting.FileSystemObject\\\").CreateTextFile\"\n\n   $a5 = \"cmd /c copy\"\n\n   $a6 = {73 79 73 74 65 6d 33 32 5c 2a 65 72 74 75 74 2a 2e 65 78 65} // system32\\*ertut*.exe\n\n   $a7 = {25 73 79 73 74 65 6d 72 6f 6f 74 25 5c 65 78 70 2a 2e 65 78 65} // %systemroot%\\exp*.exe\n\n   $a8 = \"sleep 1000\"\n\n   $a9 = \"cmd /c explorer.exe /root\"\n\n   $a10 = \"-decode \"\n\n   $b = \"tAnNIbgBTM0hVGhpcyBwcm9ncmFtIGNhbm5v\" ascii //This program cannot - base64 encoded\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n  condition:\n\n   uint16(0) == 0xCFD0 and\n\n    filesize < 2000KB and\n\n    $b and\n\n    5 of ($a*)\n\n}\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n rule LazarusCampaign_Payload_Jun2021 : WindowsMalware {\n\n  meta:\n\n    author = \"AlienLabs\"\n\n    description = \"Detects Lazarus campaign downloader Jun2021.\"\n\n    reference =\n \"https://otx.alienvault.com/pulse/294acafed42c6a4f546486636b4859c074e53d74be049df99932804be048f42c\"\n\n    SHA256 = \"f5563f0e63d9deed90b683a15ebd2a1fda6b72987742afb40a1202ddb9e867d0\"\n\n  strings:\n\n    $a1 = \"Office ClickToRun\" wide ascii\n    $a2 = \"C:\\\\Drivers\\\\\"\n\n   condition:\n\n    uint16(0) == 0x5A4D and all of them\n\n }\n\n## Associated indicators (IOCs)\n\n```\n[The following technical indicators are associated with the reported intelligence.
