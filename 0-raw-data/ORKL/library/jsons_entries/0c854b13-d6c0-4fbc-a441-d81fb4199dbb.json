Introduction\n\nThis report details some of the technical findings of the Lazarus Group’s malware,\nobserved by Novetta during Operation Blockbuster. We recommend reading the initial\nreport prior to the reverse engineering reports for more details on the Operation and the\nLazarus Group. This reverse engineering report looks at several tools found within the\nLazarus Group’s collection.\n\nNot all of the families within the Lazarus Group’s collection are inherently malicious. There are samples that perform\nsomewhat legitimate functions. These samples are tools, usually one-off tools, that the Lazarus Group may use for\na specific purpose and do not gain a wide distribution in the wild. Understanding the function of these tools adds\nadditional insight into the group’s methodologies.\n\nThe naming scheme used by Novetta for the malware identified during Operation Blockbuster consists of at least two\nidentifiers which each identifier coming from the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)’s phonetic alphabet,\ncommonly referred to as the NATO phonetic alphabet. The first identifier specifies the general classification of the\nmalware family while the second identifier specifies the specific family within the larger general classification. For\nexample, TangoAlfa specifies a tool family identified as Alfa.\n\n**FIRST LEVEL IDENTIFIER** **GENERAL CLASSIFICATION**\n\nDelta DDoS\n\nHotel HTTP Server\n\nIndia Installer\n\nLima Loader\n\nKilo Keylogger\n\nPapa Proxy\n\nRomeo RAT\n\nSierra Spreader\n\nTango Tool (Non-classed)\n\nUniform Uninstaller\n\nWhiskey Destructive Malware (“Wiper”)\n\n**Table 1‑1: First Level Identifiers for the Lazarus Group Family Names and their Classification Meanings**\n\nThere is no temporal component to the second level identifiers given to malware families. While generally the second\nidentifiers are largely sequential (Alfa, Bravo, Charlie, and so on), the identifier does not indicate that one family came\nbefore another chronologically. Instead, the second level identifiers were assigned by the order Novetta discovered each\nparticular family.\n\n\n-----\n\n## 2. [Keylogger] KiloAlfa\n\nA rudimentary but somewhat clever design, KiloAlfa provides keylogging capability for the Lazarus Group’s collection\nof malicious tools. The design of KiloAlfa is broken down into two basic components: the persistence functionality and\nthe keylogging functionality. The persistence functionality of KiloAlfa allows the malware to self-install on a victim’s\nmachine when activated (described below). The keylogging functionality, as the name would imply, provides keystroke\ncapturing capabilities by continually monitoring the foreground window and recording the current keyboard’s state to a\nlog file for later retrieval. KiloAlfa establishes a keystroke log file for each user that accesses the infected machine. KiloAlfa\nhas no capabilities to transmit the log files to an external server thereby requiring an additional companion malware\nfamily be utilized by attackers for the retrieval of the key log files.\n\nKiloAlfa is a self-installing binary. When activated without any command line arguments or with the command line\nargument –reg, KiloAlfa activates its persistence functionality. In order to maintain persistence on a victim’s machine,\nKiloAlfa copies itself to either %ALLUSERSPROFILE%\\Intel\\mscorsw.exe (if the victim is running Windows Vista\nor newer) or %ALLUSERSPROFILE%\\Application Data\\Intel\\mscorsw.exe (if the victim is running Windows\nXP or older). A registry key for HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\Mozilla Update is added\nand set to the path of the newly copied KiloAlfa binary with the –run command line argument added. If the registry key\ninsertion is unsuccessful, KiloAlfa attempts to insert the same key and value within the current user hive (HKCU).\n\nIf KiloAlfa is activated without any arguments, the persistence functionality attempts to run KiloAlfa under all users logged\ninto the victim’s machine through terminal services. By calling WTSEnumerateSessionsA to get a list of all currently\nactive Windows Terminal Services sessions, KiloAlfa uses the list of active terminal sessions to determine if explorer.exe\nis running under the session (to eliminate non-interactive user sessions); KiloAlfa then obtains the token of the user of the\nsession and calls CreateProcessAsUserA to activate the newly installed KiloAlfa binary (mscorsw.exe) with the –run\ncommand line argument. KiloAlfa then activates mscorsw.exe with the –run argument for the console session.\n\nAfter installing KiloAlfa as mscorsw.exe and activating the new binary for all active users, KiloAlfa generates and\nexecutes a suicide script to remove the initial instance of itself. The suicide script is saved to %TEMP%\\AUTOEXEO.bat and\ntakes the form presented in Figure 2-1. The script is constructed one line at a time using string concatenation and saved\nvia WriteFile before CreateProcess is called to execute the script. It is worth noting that KiloAlfa and IndiaFoxtrot\nshare the same suicide generation script code in both functionality and the script itself. Additionally, KiloAlfa and\nIndiaFoxtrot also use AUTOEXEO.bat as the suicide script’s filename.\n```\n          @echo off\n          :R1\n\n```\n**del /a \"{KiloAlfa’s filename}\"**\n**if exist \"{KiloAlfa’s filename}\" goto R1**\n**del /a \"{suicide script filename}\"**\n\n**Figure 2-1: KiloAlfa’s Suicide Script**\n\nWhen KiloAlfa is activated with the –run command line argument, KiloAlfa activates its keylogger functionality.\nThis functionality begins by loading the configuration file %ALLUSERSPROFILE%\\Application Data\\Intel\\\n```\n       AdobeUpdaterPrefs.dat (on Windows XP and later) or %ALLUSERSPROFILE%\\Intel\\AdobeUpdaterPrefs.\n       dat (on Windows Vista or newer). The configuration file contains a list of usernames and their respective keylogger\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n|OFFSET|SIZE|DESCRIPTION|\n|---|---|---|\n|0|4 Bytes|Magic Value (0xAABBCCDD)|\n|4|360 Bytes|First per-user configuration|\n|4+360n|360 Bytes|nth per-user configuration|\n\n|OFFSET|SIZE|DESCRIPTION|\n|---|---|---|\n|0|100 Bytes|Username for whom the record pertains|\n|100|260 Bytes|Full path and filename of the user’s keystroke log file|\n\n\nfilenames and paths. The structure of the configuration file (Table 2-1) consists of a magic value followed by one or more\nper-user configuration records (Table 2-2). The configuration is encrypted with RC4 using the hardcoded password\n```\n       C!@I#%VJSIEOTQWPVz034vuA. The magic value allows KiloAlfa to determine if the configuration file has been\n\n```\nsuccessful decrypted prior to attempting to read the per-user configuration records.\n\n**OFFSET** **SIZE** **DESCRIPTION**\n\n0 4 Bytes Magic Value (0xAABBCCDD)\n\n4 360 Bytes First per-user configuration\n\n4+360n 360 Bytes n[th] per-user configuration\n\n**Table 2-1: Structure of KiloAlfa’s Configuration File**\n\n**OFFSET** **SIZE** **DESCRIPTION**\n\n0 100 Bytes Username for whom the record pertains\n\n100 260 Bytes Full path and filename of the user’s keystroke log file\n\n**Table 2-2: Per-User Configuration Record’s Structure**\n\nKiloAlfa parses all of the per-user configuration records looking for one that belongs to the username under which the\nKiloAlfa executable is running. If the configuration file is corrupt or missing, or no entry is found for the current user,\nKiloAlfa generates a new record for the user and specifies the keystroke log file’s path and name as\n```\n       %LOCALAPPDATA%\\IconCache.dat. The current state of the configuration file is written back to disk.\n\n```\nThe keylogging functionality of KiloAlfa works by establishing an invisible window on the victim’s computer and then\nspawning a thread that monitors both the current foreground window’s title and the current state of the keyboard every 10ms.\nThe invisible window that KiloAlfa registers with the Windows GUI specifies its class name as “Windows IME Update” and\nprovides a very simple window procedure function. The windows procedure function (a.k.a. WinProc) only responds to three\ntypes of messages from the GUI: WM_CREATE, WM_DESTROY, and WM_ENDSESSIONS. The WM_CREATE handler activates the\nkeylogger thread after a 10 second delay, the WM_DESTROY handler simply causes the KiloAlfa binary to terminate, and the\n```\n       WM_ENDSESSIONS handler causes KiloAlfa to flush any buffered keystroke data to the keystroke log file.\n\n```\nOnce activated, the keylogger thread generates an ASCII string with the current time and date to form a header\nand sends the header to disk after encrypting the data using the DNSCALC-style encoding. After writing the\nheader to disk, the thread enters an infinite loop. At the top of the loop, the keylogger thread waits 10ms before\ncalling GetForegroundWindow to get a handle to the current foreground window. If GetForegroundWindow\ndoes not return a valid handle, the keylogger thread continues a sequence of 10ms delays followed by a call to\n```\n       GetForegroundWindow until a valid handle is obtained.\n\n```\nThe handle of the current foreground window is compared to the handle of the foreground window from the last iteration\nthrough the keylogger thread’s loop. If the foreground window has changed since the last iteration, the class name of\nthe foreground window is obtained and compared against Window IME Update; this determines if a window besides\nKiloAlfa’s window is currently in the foreground. If KiloAlfa’s window is in the foreground, the keylogger thread returns\nto the top of the loop and enters another 10ms sleep. Otherwise, the title of the foreground window is obtained, and a new\nASCII string is generated containing a separator made up of 72 hyphens followed by a line with the current time stamp\nand the title of the foreground window. The string is then sent to the keylogger thread’s keystroke log data queue.\n\nThe keylogger thread does not write entries immediately to disk. Instead, data is sent to a buffer in KiloAlfa’s memory\nuntil the buffer contains at least 2048 bytes. Once the buffer has reached the 2KB threshold, the buffer is encrypted using\nthe DNSCALC-style encoding and then written to disk. After the buffer is written to disk, the keylogger thread will clear\nthe buffer by zeroing its memory.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe keylogger thread calls GetAsyncKeyState 74 different times (for 74 different virtual keys) to determine the state\nof each key. For any key that indicates it has been pressed, the keylogger thread will record the key to the buffer. Once the\nkeylogger thread has checked all 74 different keys and their current state, the thread returns to the top of the loop and\nbegins another iteration with a 10ms delay.\n\nFigure 2-2 illustrates a keystroke log file (after decryption). The data in the log file was observed in a memory-dumped\nKiloAlfa binary.\n```\n          ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n          [2015.01.23 16:35:28] - \"Windows Explorer\"\n          ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n          [2015.01.23 16:35:32] - \"Administrator: C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe\"\n          d:\n          twi[BS][BS][BS]cd te[BS]wi5\n          twi5 D:\\Backup\n          ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n          [2015.01.23 16:35:57] - \"Start menu\n          ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n          [2015.01.23 16:36:00] - \"\"\n          ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n          [2015.01.23 16:36:00] - \"Windows Explorer\"\n          ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n          [2015.01.23 16:36:11] - \"\"\n          ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n          [2015.01.23 16:36:12] - \"Administrator: C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe -\n          twi5 D:\\Backup\"\n          n\n          n\n          y\n          ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n          [2015.01.23 16:36:22] - \"Start menu\"\n          ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n          [2015.01.23 16:36:24] - \"\"\n          ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n          [2015.01.23 16:36:24] - \"Windows Explorer\"\n          ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n          [2015.01.23 16:36:30] - \"\"\n          ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n          [2015.01.23 16:36:31] - \"Administrator: C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe -\n          twi5 D:\\Backup\"\n          y\n\n```\n**Figure 2-2: Snippet of a KiloAlfa Keystroke Log (After Decryption)**\n\n\n-----\n\nFor some samples of KiloAlfa, the developer(s) used the version information resource entry of Windows XP’s cmd.exe for\nKiloAlfa’s version information. Yet for one sample, the developer(s) took the strings, dialog, menu, and version information\nfrom mspaint.exe and imported them into the resource section of KiloAlfa. The sample that uses mspaint.exe’s\nresources is particularly unique, as it deviates from the normal KiloAlfa binary by the following key points:\n\n         - The sample does not use the configuration file (AdobeUpdaterPrefs.dat) nor does it support per-user keystroke\n\nlog files\n\n         - The sample does not activate itself under the accounts of users logged in through the terminal services\n\n         - The suicide script is named PRE{random value}.bat and changed to\n```\n          @echo off\n          :Hello\n          del /a %1\n          if exist %1 goto Hello\n          del /a %0\n\n```\n**Figure 2-3: Alternative KiloAlfa Suicide Script**\n\nBeyond the three listed changes and the inclusion of a large number mspaint.exe’s resources, the basic functionality\nand design of the errant sample is identical to the standard KiloAlfa form.\n\n\n-----\n\n## 3. [Proxy] PapaAlfa\n\nEvidence suggest that the Lazarus Group uses compromised infrastructure as the public-facing touchpoint for the\nmajority of their malware samples. PapaAlfa is believed to be one of the proxy malware components that the Lazarus\nGroup uses to hide the true command and control server(s) for operations. PapaAlfa is not a simple proxy or relay. Rather,\nPapaAlfa could be considered a smart proxy due in part to the fact that the attacker can easily switch the backend\ndestination address and port without having to reestablish control over the infected machine hosting the PapaAlfa\nmalware. PapaAlfa contains an administrative control channel (or “admin channel”) separate from its proxy channel.\nPapaAlfa is malware-traffic specific: PapaAlfa does not proxy general traffic, but rather traffic that is specific to the\nRomeo-CoreOne based families; these RAT families are discussed in Novetta’s other report on the Lazarus Group’s RAT\nand Staging capabilities.[1]\n\nIn terms of form factor, PapaAlfa comes in two flavors: service DLL and standalone executable. The primary difference\nbetween the two is that the executable variants require the admin channel’s listening port number to be specified on the\ncommand line, otherwise it defaults to 443; meanwhile, the service DLL variants receive their admin channel listening\nport from a configuration file (pmsconfig.msi). The IndiaBravo-PapaAlfa installer is responsible for installing the\nservice DLL variant.\n\nRegardless of the form factor, the core of PapaAlfa is the same. Once the core component of PapaAlfa activates (which occurs\nafter the service DLL initializes or after the standalone executable reaches the main function), the following tasks occur:\n\n1. Dynamically load API functions\n\n2. Determine the admin channel’s listening port number\n\n3. Establish the admin channel’s listening port and open a hole in the Windows Firewall to facilitate incoming\n\nconnections\n\n4. For each new incoming admin channel connection, generate a new thread to handle the communication.\n\n5. At the start of each new thread, perform a handshake between PapaAlfa and the client\n\n6. Determine if the client is requesting access to the admin channel or initiating the relay mode\n\nPapaAlfa uses the Space-Dot obfuscation method, found in multiple other Lazarus Group malware families, within the\ndynamic API loading portion of its code. Four different sets of API functions are loaded from kernel32.dll, ws2_32.dll\n(or wsock32.dll, depending on the Windows OS version), advapi32.dll, and iphapi.dll, but only a fraction of the\nloaded API functions are actually used by PapaAlfa.\n\nThe selection of the port to use for PapaAlfa’s admin channel is made either on the command line (for standalone\nexecutable versions of PapaAlfa) or from a configuration file (pmsconfig.msi) that PapaAlfa loads. Establishing the\nadmin port begins by first opening a hole within the Windows Firewall using the netsh firewall command. PapaAlfa\nuses the following code to construct that command:\n\n1 http://www.operationblockbuster.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Operation-Blockbuster-RAT-and-Staging-Report.pdf\n\n\n-----\n\n|OFFSET|SIZE|DESCRIPTION|\n|---|---|---|\n|0|4 bytes (DWORD)|Channel ID Request (dwChannel)|\n|4|4 bytes (DWORD)|Ignored, typically set to 0 (dwIPAddress)|\n|8|4 bytes (DWORD)|Client’s Internal State (dwState)|\n\n|OFFSET|SIZE|DESCRIPTION|\n|---|---|---|\n|0|4 bytes (DWORD)|Channel ID Response Code (dwChannel)|\n|4|4 bytes (DWORD)|Client’s IP Address (dwIPAddress)|\n|8|4 bytes (DWORD)|PapaAlfa’s Current State (dwState)|\n\n```\n         sprintf(szCommandLine, \"%sd.e%sc n%ssh%srewa%s ad%s po%sop%sing T%s %d \\\"%s\\\"\",\n          \"cm\", \"xe /\", \"et\", \" fi\", \"ll\", \"d\", \"rt\", \"en\", \"CP\", wPort, \"adp\")\n\n```\nThe method of constructing the netsh firewall command is very specific and can be found in both RomeoCharlie and\nTangoAlfa, allowing for a direct code-level connection between the three malware families. After opening the firewall to\nallow for incoming connections (a critical operation given that PapaAlfa operates as a server and not a client), the listening\nport is established by calling Winsock API functions socket, bind, and listen.\n\nOutside of the two form factors that PapaAlfa can have, there are two distinct variants of PapaAlfa that have emerged\nover time. While both perform the equivalent set of operations for Tasks #5 and #6, the underlying communication\nsubsystem and methodology changes. PapaAlfa-One uses a very simple, unencrypted communication subsystem and\na straight-forward command processing system, while PapaAlfa-Two employs the fake TLS communication scheme to\nencrypt communication between the client and the admin channel and uses a more robust command processing system.\n\nDespite their communication subsystem differences, the protocol of the handshake for establishing a connection between\nPapaAlfa and a client is the same. Once an external client connects to the admin channel of PapaAlfa, a new thread is\nspun up to handle the communication between itself and the client. The initial communication with the client consists\nof the client sending 12 bytes to PapaAlfa and PapaAlfa responding with 12 bytes. The 12 bytes that the client sends to\nPapaAlfa take the following format:\n\n**OFFSET** **SIZE** **DESCRIPTION**\n\n0 4 bytes (DWORD) Channel ID Request (dwChannel)\n\n4 4 bytes (DWORD) Ignored, typically set to 0 (dwIPAddress)\n\n8 4 bytes (DWORD) Client’s Internal State (dwState)\n\n**Table 3-1: PapaAlfa Client’s Initial Data Burst Format**\n\nThe 12 bytes that PapaAlfa responds with take the following format:\n\n**OFFSET** **SIZE** **DESCRIPTION**\n\n0 4 bytes (DWORD) Channel ID Response Code (dwChannel)\n\n4 4 bytes (DWORD) Client’s IP Address (dwIPAddress)\n\n8 4 bytes (DWORD) PapaAlfa’s Current State (dwState)\n\n**Table 3-2: PapaAlfa-One’s Response Format to the Client**\n\nThe Channel ID Request (dwChannel) value specified by the client indicates the type of channel that the client wishes to\nactivate. There are two supported channels: proxy activation and proxy configuration. The proxy activation channel, as\nthe name implies, is responsible for the activation of the proxy (or relay) between PapaAlfa and another endpoint, and the\nproxy configuration channel allows the connecting client to configure or reconfigure the PapaAlfa proxy.\n\n\n-----\n\n|OFFSET|SIZE|DESCRIPTION|\n|---|---|---|\n|0|4 bytes (DWORD)|IP address of client (dwIPAddress)|\n|4|4 bytes (DWORD)|Reported state of the client (dwState)|\n|8|16 bytes (SYSTEMTIME)|Time of the connection|\n\n\nThe proxy activation channel establishes a connection between PapaAlfa and a predetermined endpoint. Establishing\na connection between PapaAlfa and the configured endpoint requires another set of 12-byte data transfers between\nPapaAlfa, as the client, and the endpoint, as the server. Since the endpoint retains the same handshake protocol as the\nclients connecting to PapaAlfa, it is theoretically possible to chain multiple PapaAlfa-infected hosts together to generate a\nweb of misdirection and obfuscation.\n\nOnce PapaAlfa establishes a channel between itself and the endpoint, data transmitted to and from the client is proxied\nto the established endpoint. As mentioned previously, the PapaAlfa-One variants do not introduce any obfuscation or\nencryption to the network traffic as it traverses the PapaAlfa-One node, while PapaAlfa-Two uses the fake TLS encryption\nscheme found in other Lazarus Group malware families such as RomeoAlfa, RomeoBravo, and RomeoHotel, among\nothers. Connections between a client and PapaAlfa are recorded as a 24-byte structure, described in Table 3-3, within a log\nfile named pmslog.msi.\n\n**OFFSET** **SIZE** **DESCRIPTION**\n\n0 4 bytes (DWORD) IP address of client (dwIPAddress)\n\n4 4 bytes (DWORD) Reported state of the client (dwState)\n\n8 16 bytes (SYSTEMTIME) Time of the connection\n\n**Table 3-3: PapaAlfa’s Connection Log Entry Structure**\n\nIf the client accesses the administrative channel of PapaAlfa, the client, without authentication, can perform one of the\nfollowing functions:\n\n         - Receive information about the PapaAlfa-infected host and change the proxy endpoint\n\n         - Receive the connection log (pmslog.msi)\n\n         - Set the flag to allow PapaAlfa to proxy incoming connections\n\nThe act of configuring the endpoint that PapaAlfa will connect to is done by first requesting, via the administrative\nchannel, the infected host’s system information and then supplying the port number of the endpoint. PapaAlfa will use\nthe client’s own IP address as the IP address of the proxy’s endpoint.\n\n\n-----\n\n## 4. [Network Tester] TangoAlfa\n\nConsisting of a single known sample, TangoAlfa is a tool used to determine a victim machine’s external capabilities,\nnamely whether or not the victim machine is capable of receiving incoming connections (presumably from the Internet,\nbut possibly from the local network). In order to make such a determination, the application performs the following tasks:\n\n1. Determine the target end point from the command line or use the default end point of 69.90.29.43:8080 if no valid\n\ncommand line input is supplied\n\n2. Test if the end point will respond to a TCP socket connect request and will accept incoming data (“writable”).\n\n3. Generate a listening socket on a randomly selected port between 400 and 499 or, if unsuccessful, generate a listening\n\nport between 8000 and 8999.\n\n4. Open a hole on the victim machine’s firewall for the listening port\n\n5. Transmit the port number to the end point as a two-byte value\n\n6. Read a four-byte value from the end point to determine the success or failure of the test.\n\nIf any of the above steps fail, TangoAlfa will report an error, and the test will fail. To that end, TangoAlfa is very verbose\nabout which stage resulted in a failed test as well as which stage TangoAlfa is executing at any given time.\n\nTangoAlfa can be instructed to connect to any testing server on any port by supplying the IP address and port on the\ncommand line (separated into individual command line arguments). If the user of TangoAlfa does not supply a testing\nserver (or “end point”), then TangoAlfa will default to 69.90.29.43:8080. If TangoAlfa is unable to connect to the testing\nserver, it will display the following message:\n```\n          *****[Start Test -> 69.90.29.43:8080]\n          *****[Relay Connect Fail]\n\n```\nTangoAlfa tries up to three times to generate a listening socket on the victim’s machine. The first attempt tries for a\nlistening port randomly selected in the range of 400 to 499, while the second and third attempt tries the range of 8000\nto 8999. If after three attempts to generate a listening port TangoAlfa is unable to establish a listening port, it reports a\nfailure and terminates.\n\nAfter establishing a listening port, TangoAlfa attempts to open the Windows Firewall on the victim’s machine in order\nto allow incoming connections. TangoAlfa does this by constructing the following command and executing it via\n```\n       CreateProcess:\n\n```\n**cmd.exe /c netsh firewall add portopening TCP <listening port number> \"adp\"**\n\nOn Windows XP computers, the above command will result in the line “Ok.” being displayed, whereas on newer versions\nsuch as Windows 7, the following text will be displayed:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n          IMPORTANT: Command executed successfully.\n\n```\n**However, \"netsh firewall\" is deprecated;**\n**use \"netsh advfirewall firewall\" instead.**\n**For more information on using \"netsh advfirewall firewall\" commands**\n**instead of \"netsh firewall\", see KB article 947709**\n```\n          at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=121488.\n          Ok.\n\n```\nWith the firewall reconfigured to allow incoming connections to the listening port, TangoAlfa displays the listening\nport number to the user before sending the value to the test server as a two-byte value. After sending the port number,\nTangoAlfa waits for the test server to respond with a four-byte value or a timeout of 60 seconds, whichever comes first. If\nthe test server sends back 0 (as a 32-bit number), then TangoAlfa indicates the test was a failure as seen below:\n```\n          *****[Start Test -> X.X.X.X:80]\n          *****[Relay Connect Success]\n          Ok.\n          *****[Listen Port 483] - [Fail]\n          *****[End Test]\n\n```\nOtherwise, TangoAlfa indicates that the victim’s machine is capable of receiving incoming network connections:\n```\n          *****[Start Test -> X.X.X.X:80]\n          *****[Relay Connect Success]\n          Ok.\n          *****[Listen Port 483] - [Success]\n          *****[End Test]\n\n```\nThe structure of the test implies that the test server ultimately determines success or failure. Simply establishing a\nlistening port and accepting incoming connection does not mean a test is successful; rather, the test server must decide\nthe victim’s machine’s suitability.\n\nTangoAlfa does not use the more common features found in the Lazarus Group’s collection of malware such as the various\nencryption/obfuscation methods seen with Space-Dot, DNSCALC, or dynamic API loading. However, it is possible to directly\ntie TangoAlfa to the rest of the Lazarus Group’s malware based on the method that the developer(s) use for opening a hole in\nthe victim’s Windows Firewall. When constructing the command, TangoAlfa uses a very specific sprintf statement:\n```\n          sprintf(szCommandLine, \"%sd.e%sc n%ssh%srewa%s ad%s po%sop%sing T%s %d \\\"%s\\\"\", \"cm\", \"xe\n\n```\n**/\", \"et\", \" fi\", \"ll\", \"d\", \"rt\", \"en\", \"CP\", wPort, \"adp\")**\n\nThe same format string is found in both PapaAlfa (see Section 3) and RomeoCharlie, which have more concrete ties to the\nlarger Lazarus Group collection of malware families.\n\nGiven the purpose of TangoAlfa—the determination of the viability of a victim machine for incoming connections—and\nthe fact that a large number of server mode families are found within the Lazarus Group’s collection, this particular tool\ncould be extremely useful during an operation for finding suitable proxy hosts.\n\n\n-----\n\n## 5. [Domain Redirector] TangoBravo\n\nTangoBravo is a simple piece of malware, consisting of only a handful of non-library functions. Using a technique\ncommonly found in commodity malware versus APT-style malware, TangoBravo’s sole purpose is to prevent a victim’s\nmachine from accessing specific domains by modifying the victim’s %SYSDIR%\\drivers\\etc\\hosts file. To that end,\nthe first task that TangoBravo performs is to scan the hosts file line by line and determine if one of the following domains\nis present; if so, the line is modified to replace the existing IP address with the loopback address 127.0.0.1:\n\n         - www.alyac.co.kr\n\n        - www.boho.or.kr\n\n        - download.boho.or.kr\n\n       - www.ahnlab.com\n\n         - explicitupdate.alyac.co.kr\n\n        - gms.ahnlab.com\n\n         - ko-kr.albn.altools.com\n\n         - ko-kr.alupdatealyac.altools.com\n\n        - su.ahnlab.com\n\n        - su3.ahnlab.com\n\n        - update.ahnlab.com\n\n         - ahnlab.nefficient.co.kr\n\nTo further ensure that the above domains are inaccessible to the victim, any of the domains that were not explicitly\nmodified are appended to the end of the hosts file with the 127.0.0.1 loopback address. Note that not all variants of\nTangoBravo overwrite all of the domains; specifically, alyac.co.kr, boho.or.kr, download.boho.or.kr, and ahnlab.com are\nnot found in all samples.\n\nUpon completion of the hosts file modification, some variants of TangoBravo generate and execute a suicide script. It is\nthis suicide script generation and execution that ties TangoBravo into the larger Lazarus Group’s malware collection, as\nthe suicide script generator and suicide script content is also found in IndiaCharlie. The difference, as seen below, is that\nTangoBravo uses CreateProcess instead of WinExec to activate the script.\n\n**fp = fopen(\"d.bat\", \"w+\");**\n```\n          if ( fp )\n          {\n          fprintf(fp, \":R\\nIF NOT EXIST %s GOTO E\\ndel /a %s\\nGOTO R\\n:E\\ndel /a d.bat\", \"%1\",\n\n```\n**\"%1\");**\n**fclose(fp);**\n**sprintf(szCommandLine, \"d.bat \\\"%s\\\"\", szTangoBravoFilename);**\n```\n          CreateProcessA(0, &szCommandLine, 0, 0, 0, 0x8000000u, 0, 0, &StartupInfo,\n\n```\n**&ProcessInformation);**\n**}**\n\nAdditionally, the core component of TangoBravo has been found integrated in another malware family within the Lazarus\nGroup’s collection: IndiaGolf.\n\n\n-----\n\n|WINDOWS VERSION|FIREWALL COMMAND|\n|---|---|\n|Windows XP or older|cmd.exe /c netsh firewall set opmode mode=disable|\n|Windows Vista or newer|cmd.exe /c netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name=CoreNetworkingHTTPS dir=in action=allow Protocol=TCP|\n\n\n## 6. [Windows Firewall Disabler] TangoCharlie\n\nObserved as a payload of SierraJuliett-MikeOne, TangoCharlie is a singularly focused tool whose one and only purpose is\nto disable the Windows Firewall. Depending on the operating system, TangoCharlie will use either netsh firewall (for\nWindows XP or older) or netsh advfirewall (for Windows Vista or newer) to disable the firewall on a victim’s machine.\nTable 6-1 identifies the full command that TangoCharlie passes to WinExec in order to open the Windows Firewall\ndepending on the victim’s Windows version.\n\n**WINDOWS VERSION** **FIREWALL COMMAND**\n\nWindows XP or older **cmd.exe /c netsh firewall set opmode mode=disable**\n\n**cmd.exe /c netsh advfirewall firewall add rule**\nWindows Vista or newer\n```\n                    name=CoreNetworkingHTTPS dir=in action=allow Protocol=TCP\n\n```\n**Table 6-1: TangoCharlie’s Firewall Disabling Commands**\n\n\n-----\n\n|TARGET PROCESS NAME|DESCRIPTION2|\n|---|---|\n|McShield.exe|“The McShield On-Access Scanner Service”|\n|UdaterUI.exe|“Provides the user interface for the updates”|\n|McTray.exe|“The System tray icon management tool”|\n|shstat.exe|“It is responsible for loading the McAfee VirusScan (Vshield) +icon in the Windows system tray, the VSE About screen, the On-Access Scanner statistics, and the messages window.”|\n|FrameworkService.exe|“Provides the majority of (McAfee Agent) functionality”|\n|VsTskMgr.exe|“Facilitates janitorial duties within the” McAfee Agent|\n|mfeann.exe|“Responsible for event creation and logging” of the McAfee Agent|\n|naPrdMgr.exe|“The Product Manager for the McAfee Framework service”|\n\n\n## 7. [Antivirus Suite Killer] TangoDelta\n\nAntivirus applications can be bothersome to malware developers, and TangoDelta is a solution to a specific antivirus\nproblem: using the open source Process Hacker’s kernel driver,[2] TangoDelta attempts to terminate various McAfee\nVirusScan Enterprise and McAfee Agent-specific processes listed in Table 7-1.\n\n**TARGET PROCESS NAME** **DESCRIPTION[2]**\n\nMcShield.exe “The McShield On-Access Scanner Service”\n\nUdaterUI.exe “Provides the user interface for the updates”\n\nMcTray.exe “The System tray icon management tool”\n\n“It is responsible for loading the McAfee VirusScan (Vshield) +icon in the Windows\n\nshstat.exe system tray, the VSE About screen, the On-Access Scanner statistics, and the messages\n\nwindow.”\n\nFrameworkService.exe “Provides the majority of (McAfee Agent) functionality”\n\nVsTskMgr.exe “Facilitates janitorial duties within the” McAfee Agent\n\nmfeann.exe “Responsible for event creation and logging” of the McAfee Agent\n\nnaPrdMgr.exe “The Product Manager for the McAfee Framework service”\n\n**Table 7-1: Target Processes of TangoDelta**\n\nTangoDelta requires no command line arguments; upon activation it will generate and activate a service called\n```\n       KProcessHacker2 to load the Process Hacker driver into kernel memory. With the Process Hacker driver installed,\n\n```\nTangoDelta connects to the driver and uses the Process Hacker function TerminatorTP3 to terminate each of the\nMcAfee processes listed in Table 7-1 in order. TangoDelta pays special attention to the McShield.exe process: after\nterminating the McAfee processes, TangoDelta continually scans for McShield.exe’s process in the list of active\nprocesses on the victim’s machine, sleeping for 10ms between scans. Once McShield.exe has been successfully\nterminated, TangoDelta locates the path to the McShield.exe file by inspecting the registry key HKLM\\SYSTEM\\\n```\n       CurrentControlSet\\services\\McShield\\ImagePath and then replacing the McShield.exe binary with itself.\n\n```\nThis ensures that upon reboot, TangoDelta will load rather than the legitimate McAfee McShield.exe binary.\n\nWith the McAfee processes terminated and TangoDelta replacing the legitimate McShield.exe file, TangoDelta\ndisconnects from the Process Hacker driver and removes it from memory before deleting the driver’s service from the\nWindows services database. TangoDelta then activates the new McShield.exe binary by reactivating the McShield\nservice before generating and executing a suicide script to remove the original TangoDelta binary.\n\n[2 Wen Jia Liu. “Overview – Process Hacker” http://processhacker.sourceforge.net/. Accessed 27 November 2015.](http://processhacker.sourceforge.net/)\n2 [McAfee. “Process description and load order for VirusScan Enterprise and McAfee Agent”. https://kc.mcafee.com/corporate/index?page=content&id=KB65784&pmv=print 29 September 2015](https://kc.mcafee.com/corporate/index?page=content&id=KB65784&pmv=print)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe suicide script that TangoDelta generates is nearly identical to that of WhiskeyAlfa-One. The only difference\nbetween the suicide scripts is the superfluous strcpy(buffer, \"@echo off\\r\\n\") instruction at the beginning of\nTangoDelta’s script generation. Otherwise, the suicide scripts are identical in structure, filename (%TEMP%\\zawq.bat),\nand the APIs that are used in their generation and execution, as seen below:\n\n**strcpy(buffer, \"@echo off\\r\\n\");**\n**strcpy(buffer, \":Loop\\r\\ndel \\\"\");**\n**strcat(buffer, szTangoDeltaFilename);**\n**strcat(buffer, \"\\\"\\r\\nif exist \\\"\");**\n**strcat(buffer, szTangoDeltaFilename);**\n**strcat(buffer, \"\\\" goto Loop\\r\\ndel \\\"\");**\n**strcat(buffer, szSuicideScriptFilename);**\n**strcat(buffer, \"\\\"\");**\n**WriteFile(hFile, buffer, strlen(buffer), &NumberOfBytesWritten, 0);**\n**CloseHandle(hFile);**\n**ShellExecuteA(0, \"open\", szSuicideScriptFilename, 0, 0, 0);**\n\n\n-----\n\n## 8. Conclusion\n\nWhile the tools profiled in this report are not inherently malicious, their capabilities are nonetheless integral to the\nLazarus Group’s cyber operations, both espionage and destructive in nature, making them inherently dangerous to\npotential victims. These tools often lay the groundwork for further malicious activity, such as the targeting of antivirus\ncapabilities and the disabling of firewalls, both of which are very fundamental defensive measures. Furthermore, like\nmany other identified Lazarus Group families, these tools showcase the group’s creative solutions, such as the PapaAlfa\nproxy, which makes it difficult to immediately identify potentially malicious activity on a compromised network.\n\n\n-----\n\nMcLean, Virginia – Headquarters\n7921 Jones Branch Drive\n5th Floor\nMcLean, VA 22102\n\n**www.OperationBlockbuster.com**\n\nPhone: (571) 282-3000\nwww.novetta.com\n\n\n-----",
