In order to increase the likelihood of their malware successfully\ncommunicating home, cyber espionage threat actors are increasingly abusing legitimate web services, in\nlieu of DNS lookups to retrieve a command and control address. This negates the requirement to make\nDNS requests for domains that may be considered malicious and are therefore blocked. For attackers,\nthat's an advantage because it allows their initial communications channel to be obscured amongst other\ntraffic to legitimate services.\n\nThis blog post examines two similar malware families that utilize the aforementioned technique to abuse\nlegitimate websites, their connections to each other, and their connections to known espionage\ncampaigns. The first of which we call ‘CONFUCIUS_A’, a malware family that has links to a series\n[of attacks associated with a backdoor attack method commonly known as SNEEPY (aka ByeByeShell)](https://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/threat/encyclopedia/Entry.aspx?Name=TrojanSpy:Win32/Sneepy.A)\nfirst reported by Rapid7 in 2013. The second of which we call ‘CONFUCIUS_B’, which has a loose link to\n[the series of attacks associated with Operation Patchwork and](https://www.cymmetria.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Unveiling-Patchwork.pdf) [The Hangover Report.](https://www.bluecoat.com/security-blog/2013-05-20/hangover-report)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Confucius says… resolve your command and control domains using web services.\n\nIn 2013, Rapid7 reported on a series of relatively amateur attacks against Pakistani targets. For a long\ntime after the report was published, little changed in how the attackers operated. Although many of the\nattacks we see today from the group remain the same, we began observing a new backdoor,\nCONFUCIUS_A, being dropped by the attackers starting in early 2014. Specifically, the command and\ncontrol addresses used across multiple SNEEPY samples were being used by CONFUCIUS_A samples.\nIn the case of just one or two samples, without temporal overlap, this may not be deemed a strong link to\nCONFUCIUS_A, however it occurs across a great deal of the infrastructure we have observed.\n\nIn most cases where we have been able to identify the droppers, the attack begins with an executable\nfile being sent directly to targets via e-mail. Occasionally the attackers leverage builders for known\ndocument exploits, but most of the time they still use self-extracting binaries. The themes of the phishing\ne-mails vary according to the target, but invariably the file is compiled with an icon that matches the\nexpected content. Examples of the themes used in attacks using CONFUCIUS_A and the surrounding\ncluster of activity include:\n\nInvitations to events relevant to the recipients\nPornographic material\nFake updates to popular software products\nNews content\nPolitical content\n\nWe have limited evidence of who the targets are, but they appear to primarily be based in the Middle\nEast and parts of Asia, with a focus on Pakistan. In addition to those targets, there are occasional targets\nseen at enterprises across the globe.\n\nEarly samples of the CONFUCIUS_A malware did not use any legitimate web services for DNS\nresolution; however, more recent samples of the CONFUCIUS_A malware use a range of legitimate web\nservices to resolve command and control addresses, the highest profile of which are Yahoo and Quora.\nThe malware was given its name based on the content of one of the first pages we saw being retrieved\nto determine a command and control address, which is written in the style of a ‘Confucius says’ joke. See\nFigure 1.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1 – An example of Quora page contacted by the malware._\n\nSometimes malware communicates with legitimate web services simply to perform a connectivity check,\nbut in this case the page was too specific to suggest that was what the attackers were doing. So we\ndecided to investigate how the malware processed the resulting content.\n\n## If this is the question, what is the answer?\n\nFor the purposes of illustrating how the command and control address is decoded we will look at the\nsample with SHA256: a21b956e1be9dcfa8a28c38dc0bb0657508b5588bcf1435052700aea22910d7d.\nThis sample of the malware requests the page shown below in order to determine what IP to POST to.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2 – The Quora page contacted by the malware to retrieve its command and control address._\n\nReading through the answer, it all makes sense until the section highlighted is reached. By looking at the\nunderlying code, we found that CONFUCIUS_A is looking for keywords between the phrases “suggested\noptions are” and “hope it will help” and decoding the interim phrase. The decoding is done using a simple\nlookup table, as shown in Figure 3.\n\n_Figure 3 – A memory dump from a CONFUCIUS_A sample showing the lookup table used by the_\n_malware, the table is truncated for presentation purposes._\n\nThe lookup table begins with the marker for the beginning and end of the useful content, and then\ncontains 255 words, each of which corresponds to a number (for example prudent == 255). Using this\nlookup table in memory it can then derive the command and control address from the text between the\n\n\n-----\n\nmarkers, fill plate clever road becomes 91.210.107[.]104.\n\n_Figure 4 – HTTP POST request made to command and control server_\n\n## Additional malware contacting Yahoo and Quora\n\nDuring our investigation into the CONFUCIUS_A malware, one of the ways we tried to identify variations\nof the backdoor was by looking for samples that communicated with the same legitimate services as\nknown CONFUCIUS_A samples. In doing so, we encountered another set of samples exhibiting very\nsimilar behavior, which we refer to as CONFUCIUS_B, due to their similarity, and their likely similar\norigins. Unfortunately, we have fewer details about how CONFUCIUS_B malware is delivered or the\ntargets it intends to hit.\n\nFor the purposes of this write-up we will follow the chain of dropped files from the dropper with SHA256:\n627724fa447e3937f3cdc5388285935a52d6970a616f4ac3d02e583d160cbfc0.\n\n## Enter CONFUCIUS_B…\n\nAt first glance CONFUCIUS_B looks very similar to CONFUCIUS_A, and they are also packaged in plain\nSFX binary files. The CONFUCIUS_B executable is disguised as a PowerPoint presentation, using a\nRight-To-Left-Override (RTLO) trick and a false icon. When executed, the self-extracting RAR package\ndrops four files to the %AppData% folder, as shown in Figure 5.\n\n_Figure 5 – The files dropped by CONFUCIUS_B_\n\nFancy.vbs executes fancy.bat, which in turn opens the presentation and runs the second stage\nexecutable svchost.exe. As with CONFUCIUS_A, the initial beacons from this svchost.exe are also to\nYahoo and Quora, but the pages contacted, whilst odd did not contain any obvious markers, rather they\nappeared to be entirely gibberish:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6 – An exemplary Quora page contacted by the malware._\n\nSo far, the execution chain, involving an SFX RAR and multiple scripts is similar to some samples of\nSNEEPY, which we associate with CONFUCIUS_A, but this is where the similarities between\nCONFUCIUS_A and CONFUCIUS_B begin to diverge. Svchost.exe has a custom obfuscation scheme\nnot seen in CONFUCIUS_A. This obfuscation allows us to quickly identify all of the CONFUCIUS_B\nvariants; their hashes are included at the end of this post. The obfuscation routine is given in Figure 7.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7 – The obfuscation routine shared across all CONFUCIUS_B samples._\n\n\n-----\n\nUnderneath that custom obfuscation lies a UPX packed executable which contains the Yahoo and Quora\nfunctionality that originally piqued our interest. After unpacking the UPX code, we began reverse\nengineering the resulting binary to see how CONFUCIUS_B interacted with the Yahoo and Quora pages\nit initially requested. We discovered that CONFUCIUS_B pieces together its DNS resolution from\nkeywords in the Yahoo and Quora posts similar to that of CONFUCIUS_A.\n\nCONFUCIUS_B takes certain keywords in the Quora and Yahoo pages and applies them to a lookup\ntable in memory. Using that lookup table an IP address to POST to is derived. The way this is done can\nbe seen in a memory dump from the running process when it contacts a relevant address, for example\nas shown in Figure 8.\n\n_Figure 8 – A memory dump of a CONFUCIUS_B illustrating the lookup table and initial beacon address._\n\nThe lookup table takes key words and assigns them numbers, or a ‘.’ character, in order to build an IP\naddress, and is arranged as shown in Table 1.\n\nlove 0\n\nhate 1\n\nfire 2\n\ncouple 3\n\ngreen 4\n\nweed 5\n\nblock 6\n\nparty 7\n\nnatural 8\n\nhopeful 9\n\n\n-----\n\nor .\n\n_Table 1 – Lookup table used by the malware to determine it’s command and control address._\n\nBy applying the lookup table to the Quora page shown in Figure 6, we can derive the IP the malware will\nPOST to next for further communications.\n\nUsing our lookup table, giving us an address of 149.202.110[.]2:\n\nThis method of substituting words for components of an IP address, and the repeat use of Yahoo and\nQuora are novel, which suggest it is likely that the same malware author, or group of malware authors,\nauthored both backdoors.\n\n## Link to Patchwork and test samples\n\nThe domain “com-account-jfnjkr[.]xyz” is linked to the CONFUCIUS_B attacks as it was a C2 for the\nsample c975954fbb473ed8ce3a98ca2c4977bf22d2413db01eda87599524969565836f, which downloads\nCONFUCIUS_B. On May 24, 2016, the same domain hosted the sample\n8cfd559756630d967bb597b087af98adc75895a1ec52586d53a2d898e4a6e9b0; a basic file stealer\nmalware associated with the Patchwork attackers, via a shared mutex:\n{9754893678976458374658764387563876}.\n\nAll of the CONFUCIUS_B samples share the same mutex, “rCkBs1Uj493NaMXYY1LZ”. Pivoting through\nsamples in Palo Alto Networks AutoFocus, we were able to find what appears to be an early test sample\nof the malware that creates the same mutex; the SHA256 of the sample is\n0bd7db12ba8d9ce9d29983ef76205864dce146eb14cebe32a3431f994cc770ee. We believe it is a test\nsample, as the configured command and control domain for this sample is ‘breachframework[.]com’. This\ncan also be linked back to known CONFUCIUS_B sample via a shared SSL certificate.\nBreachframework[.]com previously resolved to 5.135.85[.]16, which used the certificate\nf6438919d27d08aa545e2f90b58d445cccac6c09, the same certificate was used by 104.23.35[.]15, a\nknown command and control address for CONFUCIUS_B. These relationships are summarized in Figure\n9.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 9 – An overview of the link to the test infrastructure._\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this blog post, we discussed two separate malware variations that behave in very similar ways and use\nsimilar techniques to acquire a C2 address, with both using Yahoo Answers and Quora to evade\ntraditional mechanisms for blocking command and control domains. Although we cannot link the two\nclusters of activity by their infrastructure, the technique used to resolve domains is unusual. We also\nbelieve that both clusters of activity have links to attacks with likely Indian origins, the CONFUCIUS_A\nattacks are linked to the use of SNEEPY/BYEBYESHELL and the CONFUCIUS_B have a loose link to\nHangover. The two malware families themselves are also very similar, and therefore we think that the\nshared technique is an indication of a single developer, or development company, behind both\nCONFUCIUS_A and CONFUCIUS_B. It is likely that the two clusters of activity are operated by two\ndifferent operators; however, as the command and control infrastructure used by each cluster differs in\nthe choices of hosting providers.\n\nPalo Alto Networks AutoFocus customers can further explore these malware families and related\ncampaigns with the
