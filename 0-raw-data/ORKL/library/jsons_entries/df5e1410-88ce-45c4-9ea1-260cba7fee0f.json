Now, an apparent aftershock\nof that attack is reverberating through the region, as a new variant of that code locks up\nhundreds of machines and handicaps infrastructure.\n\nOn Tuesday, the security community began tracking a new outbreak of ransomware tied to\nNotPetya's authors. Known as BadRabbit, the the strain has infected hundreds of computers\n—mostly in Russia, but with some victims in Ukraine, Turkey, Bulgaria, and Germany—\n[according to security firms including ESET and](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/10/24/bad-rabbit-not-petya-back-improved-ransomware/) [Kaspersky. For now, the outbreak remains](https://securelist.com/bad-rabbit-ransomware/82851/)\nonly a small fraction of the size of the NotPetya epidemic. But it has nonetheless hit several\nRussian media outlets, including the newswire Interfax, according to the Russian security\nfirm Group-IB, and also infected Ukraine's Odessa airport and Kiev subway system, partially\nparalyzing their IT systems and disabling the subway system's credit card payments,\naccording to one Ukrainian government official.\n\n\"The dangerous aspect is the fact that it was able to infect many institutions which constitute\ncritical infrastructure in such a short timeframe,\" says Robert Lipovsky, a malware researcher\nat ESET, \"which indicates a well-coordinated attack.\"\n\n\n-----\n\nKaspersky also found strong evidence tying the new attack to the creators of NotPetya. After\nthe June NotPetya outbreak, the company's analysts found that one Ukrainian news site,\nBahmut.com.ua, had been hacked to deliver the malware, along with dozens of other sites\nthat were similarly corrupted—but hadn't yet been activated to start infecting victims. Now\nKaspersky has found that 30 of those hacked sites began to distribute the BadRabbit\nmalware on Tuesday.\n\n\"This indicates that the actors behind ExPetr/NotPetya have been carefully planning the\nBadRabbit attack since July,\" writes Costin Raiu, the director of Kaspersky's global research\nand analysis team, in a note to WIRED.\n\nESET\n\nWhile Kaspersky counts just under 200 victims among its users so far, roughly 50 or 60\nUkrainian computers in the Ukrainian government alone have been infected with the\nransomware, according to Roman Boyarchuk, head of the Center for Cyber Protection within\nUkraine's State Service for Special Communications and Information Protection. Possibly\nmore devices are affected in Ukrainian private-sector networks. Given that ESET estimates\nthat only 12.2 percent of victims are in Ukraine and 65 percent are in Russia, those numbers\nsuggests several hundred infections in Russia.\n\n\"A lot of systems have been manually disconnected because of the attack,\" in part to control\nthe spread of the ransomware, says Boyarchuk. But that disruption still represents only a\nfraction of the damage Ukraine suffered from the earlier NotPetya malware attack in June—\nor in several other waves of attacks in the country's three-year, ongoing cyberwar with\nRussia. \"The scope of the territory and coverage is not that serious according to the\ninformation we have right now,\" Boyarchuk adds. \"We can’t see any massive distribution.\"\n\nFurther links to NotPetya stand out to malware analysts as well. Kaspersky notes that like\nNotPetya, the new ransomware spreads by using the Windows Management Instrumentation\nCommand-Line, or WMIC, in combination with credentials it steals using the open-source\ntool Mimikatz. Like NotPetya, BadRabbit also spreads using Microsoft's Server Message\nBlock (SMB) protocol, ESET says, though it uses credentials hardcoded into its software to\nspread between computers, rather than the leaked NSA tool known as EternalBlue that\n[NotPetya used. Cisco's Talos research division found Thursday that BadRabbit uses a](http://blog.talosintelligence.com/2017/10/bad-rabbit.html)\ndifferent leaked NSA hacking tool known as EternalRomance, which also allows infections to\nspread automatically through a network via SMB.2\n\nIf BadRabbit and NotPetya were in fact created by the same hackers, their shared origins\nraise significant questions about the ransomware's motives. After reverse-engineering\nNotPetya, some researchers found that it wasn't in fact ransomware at all, and offered\nvictims no way to recover their files even if they paid a ransom Instead, it appeared to be\nthinly disguised, destructive malware launched by state-sponsored (likely Russian) hackers,\n\n\n-----\n\nand meant only to cause maximum disruption to Ukrainian targets. But given that the\nmajority of BadRabbit's victims are Russian themselves, the new incident may raise doubts\nabout NotPetya's suspect Russian government roots.\n\nBadRabbit demands users pay .05 bitcoins, or about $286, to have their files decrypted. But\nwith its link to NotPetya's fake ransomware, whether that payment actually gets results is so\nfar unclear. Both ESET and Kaspersky's researchers declined to comment for now on the\nBadRabbit hackers' motives.\n\nUnlike NotPetya, which was mostly delivered to victim networks through tainted updates to\nthe Ukrainian accounting software MeDoc, researchers have so far found only a more run-ofthe-mill infection method used to install BadRabbit: ESET and Kaspersky found that hackers\nhad infected Russian and Ukrainian news sites to deliver the malware via a fake Flash\nupdate, tricking victims into manually installing it themselves.\n\n'The actors behind ExPetr/NotPetya have been carefully planning the BadRabbit attack\nsince July.'\n\nCostin Raiu, Kaspersky Lab\n\nBut ESET's Robert Lipovsky remains wary that the malware may have also been injected\ninto target networks with another, more devious infection trick. \"While this may very well be\n_an infection vector, it is doubtful that this was the main infection vector...and quite possibly a_\nsmoke screen,\" he says.\n\nThe Ukrainian government's Boyarchuk pointed to an alert from the Ukrainian Computer\nEmergency Response Team indicating that a Microsoft Office Dynamic Data Exchange\nvulnerability was also used to infect victims with malicious Word, Excel, and Outlook files, but\nother researchers have yet to confirm those findings. Later on Tuesday, the Ukrainian CERT\npublished a notice attributing the infections to phishing emails impersonating Microsoft\ntechnical support.1\n\nAll of that leaves plenty of unanswered questions around the mechanics and motivation of\nthis latest ransomware flareup. But whether BadRabbit turns out to be a targeted statesponsored cyberattack or merely a callous for-profit operation, it's already making its\npresence felt.\n\n\n1Updated 10/25/2017 9:00 pm EST to include more information from the Ukrainian\n\n_CERT.
