Much less common is\na phishing campaign targeting the banks themselves. Perhaps fraudsters know that there are a lot more bank customers than there are banks, and generally banks have a more\nhardened security posture than the average bank’s customer.\n\n## Target: multiple bank offices in Russia\n\nBut still, payoff potential for a successful bank compromise might be considerable. In this threat advisory, we describe a Russian-language phishing campaign active during the second\nweek of August 2017, targeting not the usual banking customers, but the Russian banks themselves. And in an unusual reversal of typical bank phishing social engineering tactics, the\nphishing emails purport to be from the bank’s customers. Consider the following phish delivered to the email address displayed on the bank’s website.  In the email screenshot with our\nadded machine translation from Russian, notice the subject line and message body text reflecting a “business customer upset about extra charges on his credit card” social engineering\ntheme (Figure 1).\n\n_Figure 1 Phishing email targeting Russia bank #1, machine translation in red boxes_\n\nFigure 2 is a screenshot of another phishing email obtained by RSA FirstWatch, targeting “Russia bank #2.” While this email is part of the same campaign, note that the body text, subject\nlines, file name, and @mail.com sender email is different from that targeting Russia bank #1, suggesting at least some manual actor modifications to the phishing email construction.\n\n_Figure 2 Phishing email targeting Russia bank #1, machine translation in red boxes_\n\nRSA FirstWatch identified 23 such attachments in this campaign, all using what appeared to be the exact same EPS exploit. The disgruntled banking customer was consistent throughout;\nillustrated below are a few attachment examples:\n\n[Exploit attachment #1 was deployed with the following names in Russian:](https://community.rsa.com/external-link.jspa?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.virustotal.com%2Fen%2Ffile%2F4c2c971109c54bf49950c852f3aee4b22266c29c86a3260d726f639c435edbf0%2Fanalysis%2F)\n\nВыписка по счету.docx (\"Account statement\")\n\nВыписка по карте.docx (\"Card statement\")\n\n\n-----\n\n[Exploit attachment #2 was deployed with the following names:](https://community.rsa.com/external-link.jspa?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.virustotal.com%2Fen%2Ffile%2F4daf49b1c70e9740444e29b6faf5e8c4fae17fe7aea636d0dfa873093982a5d6%2Fanalysis%2F)\n\nВыписка по карте.docx (or “Card statement”)\n\nВыписка по карте клиента.docx (or “Customer card statement”)\n\n[Exploit attachment #3 was deployed using the following name:](https://community.rsa.com/external-link.jspa?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.virustotal.com%2Fen%2Ffile%2F1892154cc47e8a1bc81186d131e001a22e4edbc4fd88688eb1782b934e1941b6%2Fanalysis%2F)\n\nВыписка.docx (or “Statement”)\n\nNote: Hashes of all samples will be included in the Appendix of this analysis.\n\nAs of 10 August 2017, RSA FirstWatch has high confidence that multiple individuals at many Russian banks were targeted with these malicious attachments, and believe this campaign\nwas subsequently brought to the attention of the Central Bank of Russia’s FinCERT by one or more of the banks being targeted. On 17 August 2017, the day we were finishing up this\nanalysis, a new sample was discovered being deployed, with a different C2 node and slightly different communication.\n\n## An exploit in someone else’s wrapper?\n\nBefore we get to details about the exploit used in this campaign, we should cover some history on EPS exploits in docx files. FireEye [discovered a malicious docx exploiting a zero day](https://community.rsa.com/external-link.jspa?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fireeye.com%2Fblog%2Fthreat-research%2F2015%2F09%2Fattack_exploitingmi.html)\nvulnerability in Microsoft’s Encapsulated Postscript (EPS) filter, in the summer of 2015. This EPS exploit was assigned CVE-2015-2545. In March 2017, FireEye observed both nation\nstate and financially motivated actors using EPS zero day exploits assigned as CVE-2017-0261 and CVE-2017-0262, prior to Microsoft disabling EPS rendering in its Office products with\nan update in April 2017. So it is likely one of these three EPS exploits is being employed with the perpetrator activity under investigation, perhaps hoping that their targets haven’t applied\nthe April patch that would make every EPS exploit futile.\n\nSince docx files are just a Zip-compressed container, comparing them with a file tree view might be a quick way to assess similarity on a high level. In fact, all 23 known docx files used in\nthis campaign are very nearly identical, with the same 12 component files. Varying checksums might have to do with build artifacts, perhaps even intentionally so, in order to generate a\nunique hash with each build.\n\n_Figure 3 Tree view of docx container file used to target Russian banks last week_\n\nInteresting enough 10 of these 12 docx component files (everything but the image1.eps and document.xml files) are dated April 18 [th]. This is no coincidence; in fact, those same docx\n\nt fil f d i th tt h t d b ti t t t i th i il t ti f E t E Mi i t f F i Aff i b k h thi EPS l it till\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4 Eastern European Ministry of Foreign Affairs targeted by suspected nation state actors_\n\nSo if we compare the tree view of that older docx container (Figure 5), we see that 10 of the same component files appear identical, and we can confirm that using cryptographic hashing.\n\n_Figure 5 Tree view of \"Trump\" exploit docx container, with 10 of 12 files identical to 23 recent RU bank targeting samples described in this investigation_\n\nOf special note is the common app.xml file, which comes directly from the decoy document in the “Trump” exploit file. This app.xml file contains the same URL to the California Courier\n[website (www[.]thecaliforniacourier[.]com), where the text was copied from “Trump’s Attack on Syria: Wrong for so Many Reasons”](https://community.rsa.com/external-link.jspa?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcommunity.riskiq.com%2Fsearch%2Fwww.thecaliforniacourier.com) [as described by ESET in their exploit analysis](https://community.rsa.com/external-link.jspa?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.welivesecurity.com%2F2017%2F05%2F09%2Fsednit-adds-two-zero-day-exploits-using-trumps-attack-syria-decoy%2F) .\n\n\n-----\n\nalmost certainly NOT be involved in broadly exploiting Russian banks a few months later. That being said, an alternative hypothesis is that these bank-targeting actors purposely\npurloined the older espionage related docx files to introduce uncertainty and/or mis-attribution, or even to send a message to defenders or researchers. As we'll see shortly, the attackers\nalso interestingly signed (commented) their malware with lyrics from Slipknot's Snuff.\n\n_Figure 6 Google result with Slipknot Snuff lyrics_\n\n## Which exploit is this?\n\nObfuscation is important for exploits, especially when a campaign that is broad as this one is up against a gamut of financial institutions with AV’s that have had plenty of time to add\ndetection for known EPS exploits. With initial AV coverage of these two dozen or so attachments in the single digits out of more than 50 AV vendors, RSA Engineering’s Kevin\nDouglas jumped at the chance to flex his deobfuscation skills, and here steps us through our exploit assessment.\n\n### Step 1. Unzipping the sample DOCX file, reveals the following embedded EPS Image file\n\nunzip ./2c86a55cefd05352793c603421b2d815f0e1ddf08e598e7a3f0f6b1d3928aca8\n\nArchive: ./2c86a55cefd05352793c603421b2d815f0e1ddf08e598e7a3f0f6b1d3928aca8\n\ninflating: [Content_Types].xml\n\ninflating: docProps/app.xml\n\ninflating: docProps/core.xml\n\ninflating: word/document.xml\n\ninflating: word/fontTable.xml\n\ninflating: word/settings.xml\n\ninflating: word/styles.xml\n\ninflating: word/webSettings.xml\n\ninflating: word/media/image1.eps\n\ninflating: word/theme/theme1.xml\n\ninflating: word/_rels/document.xml.rels\n\ninflating: _rels/.rels\n\n### Step 2.

Quoting lyrics from Slipknot's Snuff in the comments (%%Myheartisjusttoodarktocare, %%Icantdestroywhatisntthere)\n\n3.

A likely XOR decode loop: (0 1 A1 length 1 sub { /A5 exch def A1 A5 2 copy get A2 A5 4 mod get xor put } for A1 } )\n\n6. A likely execution of the payload once it is decoded (exec )\n\n7.

Decoding the payload\n\nUsing the multibyte XOR Key (7a5d5e20), the payload can be decoded by XOR’ing each byte of the payload with its (position % 4) in the XOR key. For example, position 0 in the payload\nis XOR’d against 0x7a, position 1 is XOR’d against 0x5d, position 2 is XOR’d against 0x5e, position 3 is XOR’d against 0x20.
