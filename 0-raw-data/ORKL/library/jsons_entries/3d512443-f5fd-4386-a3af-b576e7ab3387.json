The\nmalicious app, called Radio Balouch aka RB Music, is actually a fully working streaming\nradio app for Balouchi music enthusiasts, except that it comes with a major sting in its tail –\nstealing personal data of its users. The app snuck into the official Android app store twice,\nbut was swiftly removed by Google both times after we alerted the company to it.\n\nAhMyth, the open-source Remote Access Tool from which the Radio Balouch app borrowed\nits malicious functionality, was [made publicly available in late 2017. Since then, we have](https://twitter.com/LukasStefanko/status/921676302347898880)\nwitnessed various malicious apps based on it; however, the Radio Balouch app is the very\nfirst of them to appear on the official Android app store.\n\nESET’s mobile security solution has been protecting users from AhMyth and its derivatives\nsince January 2017 – even before AhMyth went public. As the malicious functionality in\nAhMyth is not hidden, protected or obfuscated, it is trivial to identify the Radio Balouch app\n– and other derivatives – as malicious, and classify them as belonging to the AhMyth family.\n\nBesides Google Play, the malware, detected by ESET as Android/Spy.Agent.AOX, has\nbeen available on alternative app stores. Additionally, it has been promoted on a dedicated\nwebsite, via Instagram, and YouTube. We have reported the malicious nature of the\ncampaign to the respective service providers, but received no response.\n\nRadio Balouch is a fully working streaming radio app for music specific to the Balouchi\nregion (for the sake of consistency, we follow the spelling used in the campaign; the most\ncommon transcriptions are “Balochi” or “Baluchi”). In the background, however, the app\nspies on its victims.\n\nOn Google Play, we discovered different versions of the malicious Radio Balouch app twice\nand in each case, the app had 100+ installs. We reported the first appearance of this app\non the official Android store to the Google security team on July 2nd, 2019, and it was\nremoved within 24 hours.\n\n\nThe malicious Radio Balouch app reappeared on Google Play on July 13, 2019. This one,th\ntoo, was immediately reported by ESET and swiftly removed by Google.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1. The malicious Radio Balouch app appeared twice on Google Play_\n\nAfter being removed from Google Play, the malicious radio app is only available on thirdparty app stores at the time of writing. It has also been distributed from a dedicated website,\nradiobalouch[.]com, via a link promoted via a related Instagram account. This server was\nalso used for the spyware’s C&C communications (see below). The domain was registered\non March 30, 2019, and shortly after our complaint, the website was down and still is atth\nthe time of writing.\n\nThe attackers’ Instagram account still, at the time of writing, serves a link to the app that\nhas been removed from Google Play. They have also set up a YouTube channel with one\nvideo introducing the app; apparently, they don’t promote it as the video has a mere 21\nviews at the time of writing.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2. The Radio Balouch website (left), Instagram account (center) and promotional YouTube_\n\n_video (right)_\n\n## Functionality\n\nThe malicious Radio Balouch app works on Android 4.2 and above. Its internet radio\nfunctionality is bundled with the functionality of AhMyth into one malicious app.\n\nAfter installation, the internet radio component is fully functional, playing a stream of\nBalouchi music. However, the added malicious functionality enables the app to steal\ncontacts, harvest files stored on the device and send SMS messages from the affected\ndevice.\n\nFunctionality for stealing SMS messages stored on the device is also present. However, this\nfunctionality can’t be utilized since Google’s recent restrictions only allow the default SMS\napp to access those messages.\n\nAs AhMyth has more variants whose functionalities vary, the Radio Balouch app and any\nother malware based on this open-source espionage tool might get further functions in the\nfuture via an update.\n\nAfter launch, users choose their preferred language (English or Farsi); in the next step, the\napp starts requesting permissions. First, it requests access to files on the device, which is a\nlegitimate permission for a radio app to enable its functionality; if declined, the radio would\nnot work.\n\nThen, the app requests the permission to access contacts. Here, to camouflage its request\nfor this permission, it suggests this functionality is necessary should the user decide to\nshare the app with friends in their contact list. If the user declines to grant the contact\npermissions, the app will work regardless.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3. Radio Balouch app’s permissions requests_\n\nAfter the setup, the app opens its home screen with music options, and offers the option to\nregister and login. However, any “registering” is meaningless as any input will bring the user\ninto the “logined” state, in the operators’ poor English. Probably, this step has been added\nto lure credentials from the victims and try to break into other services using the obtained\npasswords – a reminder to never reuse passwords across services. On a side note: the\ncredentials are transmitted unencrypted, over an HTTP connection.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4. Radio Balouch app’s Home (left) and Settings (right) screens_\n\nFor C&C communication, Radio Balouch relies on its (now defunct) radiobalouch[.]com\ndomain. This is where it would send information it has gathered about its victims – notably\ninformation about the compromised devices, and the victims’ contacts lists. As with the\naccount credentials, the C&C traffic is transmitted unencrypted over an HTTP connection.\n\n_Figure 5. Radio Balouch’s communication with its C&C server_\n\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe (repeated) appearance of the Radio Balouch malware on the Google Play store should\nserve as a wake-up call to both the Google security team and Android users. Unless\nGoogle improves its safeguarding capabilities, a new clone of Radio Balouch or any other\nderivative of AhMyth may appear on Google Play.\n\nWhile the key security imperative “Stick with official sources of apps” still holds, it alone\ncan’t guarantee security. It is highly recommended that users scrutinize every app they\nintend to install on their devices and use a reputable mobile security solution.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)\n\n**Hash** **ESET detection name**\n\nF2000B5E26E878318E2A3E5DB2CE834B2F191D56 Android/Spy.Agent.AOX\n\nAA5C1B67625EABF4BD839563BF235206FAE453EF Android/Spy.Agent.AOX\n\n22 Aug 2019 - 11:30AM\n\n### Sign up to receive an email update whenever a new article is published in our Ukraine Crisis – Digital Security Resource Center\n\n Newsletter\n\n Discussion\n\n\n-----",
