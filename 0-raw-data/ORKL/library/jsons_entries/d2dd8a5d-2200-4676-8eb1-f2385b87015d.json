The default port is 1604. You must also have a dynamic dns\n[address which you can get from https://no-ip.com/. To get started build a client by clicking the](https://no-ip.com/)\nbuilder button in the main settings, please note the client tag is how you will know which\nclient is which (assuming you are not using the program maliciously), and the name is the\noutput exe file. Enter your DNS address and port into their designated fields. If you do not\nknow what the update interval is you can leave it as is. Once you are done click build. Next\nset the settings up, fill your port in the port field if you changed it, if you do not know what the\nupdate interval is you can leave it as is. You can now hit the start server button and the\nserver will now listen for connections.\n\n**Client Options: Once a client is connected you can select the client and right click on the**\nclient to bring up a menu of options, or you can select the client and click start remote\ndesktop if you wish to start the remote desktop. Some client options have special functions\nas listed below:\n\nProcess Manager (Get Running Applications): Right click to bring up options for\nrefreshing and closing processes.\nFile Browser: Right click to bring up options for downloading, uploading, refrshing, and\ndeleting files. Note that for uploading you may drag and drop a file into the browser to\nupload it into the directory it is currently in.\nClipboard Text: Note you do not have to close the dialog if you want to get another\ncopy of the currently copied text on the client. Just hit Get Clipboard Text again and the\ndialog will automatically update.\n\n### Screenshot:\n\n\n-----\n\n### Demo:\n\n## A Special Thanks To:\n\n**NinjahZ**\n\n**[NYAN-x-CAT (https://github.com/NYAN-x-CAT)](https://github.com/NYAN-x-CAT)**\n\n## Important Disclaimer:\n\n\n-----\n\n**I, the creator, am in no way responsible for any actions that you may make using this**\n**software.
