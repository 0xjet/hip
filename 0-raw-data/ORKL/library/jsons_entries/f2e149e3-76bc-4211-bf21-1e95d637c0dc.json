Messes Up Encryption\n\n**[bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/thanatos-ransomware-is-first-to-use-bitcoin-cash-messes-up-encryption](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/thanatos-ransomware-is-first-to-use-bitcoin-cash-messes-up-encryption/)**\n\nBy\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nFebruary 26, 2018\n12:56 PM\n0\n\nRansomware developers continue to release infections that are clearly not tested well and\ncontain bugs that may make it difficult, if not impossible, for victims to recover their files.\nSuch is the case with the new in the wild ransomware called Thanatos that has been\n[discovered by security researcher MalwareHunterTeam.](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam)\n\nWhen the Thanatos Ransomware infects a victim it will use a new key for each encrypted file.\n[The problem, according to researcher Francesco Muroni, is that these keys are never saved](https://twitter.com/FraMauronz)\nanywhere. This means that if a user pays the ransom, the ransomware developer does not\nhave a method that will actually be able to decrypt each file. Therefore, it is not\nrecommended that victims pay the Thanatos ransom for any reason.\n\nThe good news is that according to Muroni it may be possible to brute force the encryption\nkey for each file. This would take quite a bit of time and would require the file to be a\ncommon file type with a known magic header.\n\n### Thanatos is the first ransomware to accept Bitcoin Cash\n\nWhile the encryption part of Thanatos is a mess, the ransomware does introduce something\nnew. That is being the first ransomware to accept Bitcoin Cash as a ransom payment.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with Bitcoin Cash, it is a new cryptocurrency that was spun off from\nBitcoin. When Bitcoin hit block 478,558, Bitcoin was forked into a new cryptocurrency called\nBitcoin Cash. When this fork occurred, Bitcoin holders were then given an equivalent amount\nof Bitcoin Cash. For example, if a user had 2 Bitcoins at the time of the fork, they would have\nreceived 2 Bitcoin Cash as well.\n\nWhile Thanatos accepts both Bitcoin and Etherum as a ransom payment, this is the first time\nthat Bitcoin Cash has been accepted as shown in the ransom note below.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Thanatos Ransom Note**\n\n### How Thanatos Ransomware encrypts a Computer\n\nWhen the Thanatos Ransomware encrypts a computer it will generate a new encryption key\nfor every file encrypted. As discussed already, unfortunately these encryption keys are not\nsaved anywhere and thus according to researchers it would not be possible for the developers\nto decrypt the files even if a ransom payment is made.\n\nWhen encrypting files it will append the .THANATOS extension to an encrypted file's name.\nFor example, a file named test.jpg would be encrypted and renamed as test.jpg.THANATOS.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Thanatos Encrypted Files**\n\nAfter the encryption process is finished it will then connect to iplogger.com/1t3i37 URL in\norder to keep track of the amount of victims that have been infected.\n\nFinally, it will generate an autorun key called \"Microsoft Update System Web-Helper\" that\nopens the README.txt ransom note every time a user logs in. This ransom note can be seen\nin the article's previous section.\n\nThis ransom note contains instructions to send a $200 USD ransom payment to one of the\nlisted Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Bitcoin Cash addresses. The user is then instructed to\ncontact thanatos1.1@yandex.com with their unique victim ID in order to receive a decryption\nprogram.\n\nAs already stated, this ransomware can not be decrypted normally due to it not saving the\nencryption keys and thus the ransom payment should not be made. If anyone is infected with\nthis ransomware, they should contact us about the possible creation of a brute force program.\n\n### How to protect yourself from the Thanatos Ransomware\n\nIn order to protect yourself from ransomware in general, it is important that you use good\ncomputing habits and security software. First and foremost, you should always have a\nreliable and tested backup of your data that can be restored in the case of an emergency, such\nas a ransomware attack.\n\n\n-----\n\nYou should also have security software that incorporates behavioral detections to combat\nransomware and not just signature detections or heuristics. For example, Emsisoft Anti[Malware and Malwarebytes Anti-Malware both contain behavioral detection that can prevent](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/malwarebytes-anti-malware/)\nmany, if not most, ransomware infections from encrypting a computer.\n\nLast, but not least, make sure you practice the following security habits, which in many cases\nare the most important steps of all:\n\nBackup, Backup, Backup!\nDo not open attachments if you do not know who sent them.\nDo not open attachments until you confirm that the person actually sent you them,\n[Scan attachments with tools like VirusTotal.](https://www.virustotal.com/#/home/upload)\nMake sure all Windows updates are installed as soon as they come out! Also make sure\nyou update all programs, especially Java, Flash, and Adobe Reader. Older programs\ncontain security vulnerabilities that are commonly exploited by malware distributors.\nTherefore it is important to keep them updated.\nMake sure you use have some sort of security software installed that uses behavioral\ndetections or white list technology. White listing can be a pain to train, but if your\nwilling to stock with it, could have the biggest payoffs.\nUse hard passwords and never reuse the same password at multiple sites.\n\nFor a complete guide on ransomware protection, you visit our How to Protect and Harden a\nComputer against Ransomware article.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[New ‘Cheers’ Linux ransomware targets VMware ESXi servers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-cheers-linux-ransomware-targets-vmware-esxi-servers/)\n\n[SpiceJet airline passengers stranded after ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/spicejet-airline-passengers-stranded-after-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[US Senate: Govt’s ransomware fight hindered by limited reporting](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-senate-govt-s-ransomware-fight-hindered-by-limited-reporting/)\n\n[New RansomHouse group sets up extortion market, adds first victims](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-ransomhouse-group-sets-up-extortion-market-adds-first-victims/)\n\n[Ransomware attack exposes data of 500,000 Chicago students](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-attack-exposes-data-of-500-000-chicago-students/)\n\n## IOCs\n\n### Hashes:\n```\nfe1eafb8e31a84c14ad5638d5fd15ab18505efe4f1becaa36eb0c1d75cd1d5a9\n\n Ransom Note Text:\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n ________ _____  _  _____ __________ _____\n /_ __/ / / /  | / | / /  |/_ __/ __ \\/ ___/\n / / / /_/ / /| | / |/ / /| | / / / / / /\\__ \\ \n / / / __ / ___ |/ /| / ___ |/ / / /_/ /___/ / \n/_/ /_/ /_/_/ |_/_/ |_/_/ |_/_/ \\____//____/ \n--------------------------------------------------        Thanatos v1.1\nYour files was encrypted.
