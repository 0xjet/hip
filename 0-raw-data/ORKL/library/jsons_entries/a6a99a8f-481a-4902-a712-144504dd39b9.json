Although some threat actors maintain their strategies for a long time, sophisticated actors\ncontinuously sharpen their tools, techniques and procedures (TTPs) and aggressively adopt new attack methodologies.\nPerhaps no other threat actor exhibits this trend more than the Lazarus group: an extremely prolific threat actor operating\nglobally and linked to such high-profile and devastating cyber attacks as the Sony Pictures Entertainment hack, several\ncryptocurrency hacks, and the WannaCry worm outbreak.\n\nUnlike other state-sponsored threat actors, Lazarus uses its attack campaigns to achieve a variety of aims, from cyber\nespionage to financial profit. In fact, it is because of this broad spectrum of goals that the group keeps expanding the scale of\nits cyber attacks and drawing the attention of the security community. Untangling and connecting the various waves of the\ngroup’s activity has become no small undertaking, and different security researchers have their own methodologies and\nconclusions. In this paper we will focus on a relatively novel malware cluster of the Lazarus group, as well as our perspective\non the various representative clusters of the Lazarus group, their connections with one another, and their differences.\n\n**INTRODUCTION**\n\nAfter the Sony Pictures Entertainment hack and the publication of the Operation BlockBuster [1] research, the Lazarus\ngroup began to garner much more attention from the security industry. When Lazarus first began operating, they used a\nsmall malware cluster and few cyber attack capabilities. We have continued to track this malware cluster, named\nManuscrypt. In its early stages, the Manuscrypt cluster utilized simple malware sets and was used for an extended period to\nachieve various goals.\n\nHowever, Manuscrypt’s modus operandi began to change in 2018. Several malware clusters started to spin-off from the\noriginal malware and were developed independently, creating new malware strains and attack methodologies. Today,\nLazarus has become one of the biggest and most notable threat actors with sufficient capabilities to attack various industries\nsimultaneously. As the scale of the Lazarus group increases, many security vendors have published their perspectives on\nattribution and clustering. Such endeavours by security vendors are always positive in nature, as they’re a vital part of\nkeeping the community informed about threat actors’ progress and latest activity. However, such efforts can occasionally\nlead to confusion because of the difference in standards. The attribution of the Lazarus group is incredibly tangled these\ndays, but, given the group’s highly prolific nature, it’s a situation that needs clarity. That is why we would like to share our\nperspective on this group and its representative clusters, starting with Manuscrypt.\n\nFigure 1 represents a simple timeline of the Lazarus group’s clusters. It contains a relatively new cluster after 2018. This\ntimeline is based on the time when the malware was first discovered or its compilation time. Most clusters originate from\nthe Manuscrypt cluster. Although the Lazarus group used the Manuscrypt variant until recently, its usage rate decreased\ndramatically as malware clusters and attack methodologies began to diversify.\n\n_Figure 1: Lazarus malware history._\n\n**I NTRODUCTION OF CLUSTERS**\n\nThe clusters mentioned in this report are not all of the clusters utilized by the Lazarus group. Rather, we describe the most\ncommonly used and well-known clusters to us. We have published information about several clusters publicly, however,\nsome are unfamiliar to the public so we will add a brief introduction to each of them.\n\n**AppleJeus**\n\n_Kaspersky published details of Operation AppleJeus and its updates in 2018 [2], [3]. In this operation, the Lazarus group set_\nup fake websites and social media profiles related to cryptocurrency companies. A remarkable aspect of this operation is\n\n\n-----\n\nthat Lazarus targeted macOS users at first. After gaining trust from the victim, Lazarus sent an email or a social media\nmessage to the victim, prompting them to install a cryptocurrency trading application.\n\nThe AppleJeus cluster updates its infection scheme continuously. When the victim installs the trojanized application, it\nfetches the next-stage payload after sending the victim’s profiles. However, this next-stage payload is delivered selectively\nby the malware operator. As a result, only valuable hosts receive the following stage malware. The trojanized application\nfetches Manuscrypt/Fallchill variants, which are attributed to the Lazarus group. The malware also uses multi-stage\ninfection in this phase. Generally, the installer malware implants the malware for the next phase of the infection.\nEventually, the loader malware loads a backdoor component and begins backdoor operations.\n\n_Figure 2: Example of AppleJeus infection._\n\n**From when** June 2018\n\n**Tools** Trojanized application (Windows and macOS version), installer, loader, backdoor\n\n**Targeted platform** Windows, macOS\n\n**Victimology** Cryptocurrency exchange, FinTech company\n\n**ThreatNeedle**\n\nThe ThreatNeedle cluster is the most heavily used by the Lazarus group. Kaspersky discovered this variant in a\ncryptocurrency exchange in the middle of 2018. Since then, this cluster has been evolving and has been used aggressively.\nThe Lazarus group spreads the ThreatNeedle cluster using various methods: watering-hole attacks, spear phishing with\nweaponized documents, and trojanized applications. ThreatNeedle is a representative malware cluster using multi-stage\ninfection. It consists of various components, such as an installer, loader, injector, downloader and backdoor. Usually, binary\ninfection starts from the installer or loader component after initial infection. As the name implies, the installer consists of\nthe pieces to implant. The loader or injector is the primary element used in this cluster, and it plays a very important role.\nFor example, when malware operators move laterally, they copy the loader malware to the remote host and execute it\nmanually. The loader and injector always have a target file to be loaded or injected. They read the target contents from\nvarious sources:\n\n - From the loader itself\n\n - From a hard-coded file path\n\n - From a registry key saved by an installer\n\nThey also use various algorithms to decrypt payloads, such as XOR, RC4 and AES. The backdoor executed by the loader\nand injector communicates with the C2 server and only runs in the memory. Moreover, ThreatNeedle uses various tricks to\nhinder analysis:\n\n - It retrieves API addresses at runtime.\n\n - It gets a decryption key from the command line or file.\n\n - It loads the decryption key or configuration data from an encrypted file or registry.\n\nDuring our efforts to track this cluster, we observed many victims. The Lazarus group used this cluster for various purposes:\nfinancial profit and cyber espionage. When we first noticed this cluster, it was focused on attacking cryptocurrency-related\ncompanies. However, in early 2019 it shifted targets to a mobile games developer and mobile games software company. The\nprimary intention of the cluster is to compromise a renowned mobile application, and then collect defence and governmentrelated intelligence using the compromised mobile application. Another big shift happened in early 2020: this cluster started\nto attack the defence industry aggressively [4]. We confirmed that the Lazarus group successfully compromised and\nexfiltrated data from one defence company. In early 2021, the Google Threat Analysis Group (TAG) announced that the\n\n|From when|June 2018|\n|---|---|\n|Tools|Trojanized application (Windows and macOS version), installer, loader, backdoor|\n|Targeted platform|Windows, macOS|\n|Victimology|Cryptocurrency exchange, FinTech company|\n\n\n-----\n\nLazarus group had attacked security researchers with highly sophisticated social engineering, and it was the ThreatNeedle\ncluster that was used in this campaign. As we can see, the ThreatNeedle cluster is the most widely used tool of the Lazarus\ngroup.\n\n_Figure 3: Example of ThreatNeedle infection._\n\n**From when** February 2018\n\n**Tools** Installer, downloader, loader, injector, backdoor\n\n**Targeted platform** _Windows, Android_\n\n**Victimology** Cryptocurrency businesses, mobile games company, defence industry,\nsecurity researchers\n\n**DeathNote (a.k.a. DreamJob)**\n\nThe DeathNote cluster was discovered in 2018 at cryptocurrency exchanges [5]. When we first found this cluster, it only\ntargeted cryptocurrency exchanges for financial profit. But from early 2020 it shifted its target to those interested in defence\nindustry jobs. The description of a vacancy in the defence industry was used as a decoy document. ClearSky also published\na comprehensive ‘Operation DreamJob’ report on this cluster [6].\n\n_Figure 4: Decoy document related to defence industry job vacancy._\n\nThis cluster uses spear phishing with remote-template linked Word documents or trojanized PDF reader programs. Those\ntwo initial infection vectors create a downloader responsible for uploading profiles of the victim and fetching the next-stage\npayload. The malware operator only delivers the next payload if the victim is deemed valuable by the attackers.\nOccasionally, the threat actor uses a more complicated binary infection by adopting an injector or loader. The final payload\nis the Manuscrypt or COPPERHEDGE malware already attributed to the Lazarus group.\n\n|From when|February 2018|\n|---|---|\n|Tools|Installer, downloader, loader, injector, backdoor|\n|Targeted platform|Windows, Android|\n|Victimology|Cryptocurrency businesses, mobile games company, defence industry, security researchers|\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5: Example of DeathNote infection._\n\nThe DeathNote cluster has many overlaps with the ThreatNeedle cluster. Some vendors categorized the ThreatNeedle\ncluster as the same as the DeathNote cluster since it has also targeted the defence industry with a similar job vacancy decoy\ndocument since early 2020. However, the clusters have different payloads and techniques after the initial infection phase.\nTherefore, we still divide them into two distinct clusters.\n\n**From when** October 2018\n**Tools** Trojanized PDF reader, remote template injection malicious Word documents, downloader,\nbackdoor (Manuscrypt/COPPERHEDGE)\n**Targeted platform** _Windows_\n**Victimology** Automobile, academic & defence industry\n\n**Bookcode**\n\nThe Bookcode cluster is a relatively novel one. This cluster was discovered in the middle of 2020 [7], but it has been used\nsince 2018. It utilizes the ‘bookcode’ parameter in HTTP traffic for C2 communication, hence the name Bookcode. The\nLazarus group delivers this cluster using various methods: trojanized applications, watering holes, and supply-chain attacks.\nInitially, we discovered this malware at a software vendor in South Korea. Lazarus had delivered the Bookcode malware\nseveral times against this victim to compromise their supply chain. Moreover, ESET also published a report that the Lazarus\ngroup had conducted a supply-chain attack using the Bookcode cluster [8]. In early 2021, the Lazarus group also attacked a\npharmaceutical company using the Bookcode cluster.\n\n_Figure 6: Example of Bookcode infection._\n\n**From when** July 2018\n**Tools** Installer, injector, backdoor\n**Targeted platform** _Windows_\n**Victimology** Software vendor, defence contractor, pharmaceutical company\n\n**CookieTime (a.k.a. LCPDot)**\n\nWhile investigating the ThreatNeedle cluster targeting the defence industry, we discovered different malware variants\nnamed CookieTime (a.k.a. LCPDot). This malware uses an encoded cookie value to deliver the request type to the C2\nserver and fetch command files. In this communication process, the malware takes advantage of steganography techniques.\nThe data between the C2 server and the victim are encrypted, and a GIF header is added to evade network detection.\n\n|From when|October 2018|\n|---|---|\n|Tools|Trojanized PDF reader, remote template injection malicious Word documents, downloader, backdoor (Manuscrypt/COPPERHEDGE)|\n|Targeted platform|Windows|\n|Victimology|Automobile, academic & defence industry|\n\n|From when|July 2018|\n|---|---|\n|Tools|Installer, injector, backdoor|\n|Targeted platform|Windows|\n|Victimology|Software vendor, defence contractor, pharmaceutical company|\n\n\n-----\n\nWith this cluster, Lazarus employed macro-embedded Word documents or trojanized applications to infect the victim. The\nmalicious Word document implants a downloader named Agamemnon (from its internal name) to fetch the next payload.\nAfter sending the profile of the victim, the CookieTime malware is delivered.\n\n_Figure 7: CookieTime infection procedure._\n\n**From when** August 2020\n\n**Tools** Trojanized application, loader, downloader, backdoor\n\n**Targeted platform** _Windows_\n\n**Victimology** Defence industry, energy industry, pharmaceutical companies\n\n**Mata (a.k.a. Dacls)**\n\nThe Mata cluster has several components, such as a loader, orchestrator and plug-ins. This comprehensive framework can\ntarget Windows, Linux and macOS operating systems. The first artifacts we found relating to Mata were used around April\n2018 [9]. After that, the actor behind this advanced malware framework used it aggressively to infiltrate corporations\naround the world. The primary purpose of this malware cluster was to spread ransomware or exfiltrate sensitive information\nfrom the victim. Unlike the other clusters, the Mata cluster has the same aims as a cybercrime group.\n\n_Figure 8: Mata infection procedure._\n\n|From when|August 2020|\n|---|---|\n|Tools|Trojanized application, loader, downloader, backdoor|\n|Targeted platform|Windows|\n|Victimology|Defence industry, energy industry, pharmaceutical companies|\n\n|From when|May 2018|\n|---|---|\n|Tools|Loader, orchestrator, plug-ins|\n|Targeted platform|Windows, macOS, Linux|\n|Victimology|Various companies|\n\n\n-----\n\n**CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE CLUSTERS**\n\nEach cluster has a different infection scheme and components. However, by understanding the full attack procedure, we\ndiscovered many overlaps between the clusters. Based on these connections, we have been able to attribute these clusters to\nthe same threat actor.\n\nThe first overlap is code similarities. Most clusters started from the same malware origin. Although the first-stage payload\ndoes not have any code overlap, the threat actor used known Lazarus malware in the second and third stages.\n\nAnother connection is the similarity of post-exploitation tools. For example, the Lazarus group used a home-made\ntunnelling tool to maintain auxiliary access. This tunnelling tool was discovered in both the AppleJeus cluster and the\nThreatNeedle cluster.\n\nThe next overlap is the sharing of command-and-control servers. While tracking the Lazarus group, we had several\nopportunities to investigate its command-and-control infrastructure. The CookieTime, Bookcode and ThreatNeedle clusters\nmade heavy use of compromised web servers in South Korea, and those clusters occasionally shared C2 servers. Although\nthe paths of the corresponding C2 script were different, the same compromised web server was abused in a similar period.\nMoreover, an identical custom webshell was used to control the ThreatNeedle and DeathNote C2 servers. The Lazarus\ngroup uploads different malware cluster scripts after compromising those servers.\n\nIn addition, different malware variants were discovered during the same incident. For example, when Lazarus attacked the\ndefence industry, it utilized a profiling malware named LPEclient with the ThreatNeedle cluster. The Bookcode cluster also\nused LPEclient when it attacked South Korea.\n\nSimply put, we can summarize the connection between the clusters based on the following. Several clusters have code\noverlaps and similarities in metadata. Some clusters have a weak overlap with others, while in other cases one cluster has\nmany overlaps with others. Note that ThreatNeedle, DeathNote and Bookcode have relatively strong connections. They\nshow substantial overlaps, including sharing a C2 server, having been discovered from the same victim, and using the same\ntools. On the other hand, Mata has less connection with the previously known Lazarus clusters.\n\n_Figure 9: Connection between clusters._\n\n**D IFFERENCES**\n\nLazarus’s arsenal has many overlaps. So why, then, do we put some tools in one cluster and call them by one name to\navoid chaos in the security industry? We try to categorize those clusters because there are still many differences in\ntheir tools and techniques. Organizing each campaign based on their technical differences is essential. From the\ndefender’s perspective, different attack methodologies require different defence strategies, and the Lazarus group’s\nclusters still have various differences. Therefore, it’s necessary to cluster each cyber threat with a thorough technical\nbackground.\n\n\n-----\n\n**U sed tools and techniques**\n\nWhen we look into each cluster’s infection procedure and malware component, we can easily see that they use different\ninfection schemes. The Lazarus group usually uses well-known initial infection vectors, some of which include spear\nphishing and watering holes. But several clusters prefer specific infection methods. For example, AppleJeus relied heavily\non fake company websites and social media accounts to acquire a high level of trust from the victim and always generated\ntrojanized cryptocurrency-related applications to compromise the victim. Like other threat actors, the Lazarus group relies\nheavily on spear phishing with a weaponized document. We’ve witnessed that only the ThreatNeedle and Bookcode\nclusters utilized the watering-hole techniques to deliver malware. The Mata cluster only used the exploitation of\nInternet-facing network devices.\n\nOne cluster doesn’t signify one malware family. Instead, each cluster consists of several components. These components\nare associated with the binary infection procedure, and they signify what kind of infection techniques they prefer. A\nrelatively complicated cluster such as ThreatNeedle contains more components than others. On the other hand, the Mata\ncluster uses entirely different components. It works based on plug-ins, and an orchestrator controls each plug-in.\n\n**Clusters** **Infection method** **Malware component**\n\nTrojanized application\n\nSpear phishing\n\nAppleJeus Installer, downloader, loader, backdoor\n\nContact through social media\n\nUse of Telegram channel\n\nSpear phishing\n\nTrojanized application (a well-known program) Installer, downloader, loader, injector,\n\nThreatNeedle\n\nWatering hole backdoor\n\nContact through social media\n\nSpear phishing\nDeathNote Downloader, backdoor\n\nTrojanized application (PDF reader)\n\nWatering hole\nBookcode Installer, injector, backdoor\n\nTrojanized application (a security program)\n\nSpear phishing\nCookieTime Downloader, loader, backdoor\n\nTrojanized application (a well-known program)\n\nMata Exploit vulnerable network device Loader, orchestrator, plug-ins\n\nGenerally, the Lazarus group configures command-and-control servers in multiple stages. The first-stage C2 server is faced\nwith the implant, and is responsible for the proxy. It saves profiles from the victim and forwards them to the second-stage\nserver, as well as delivering the malware operator’s commands from the second-stage server. The malware operator uses the\nsecond-stage server to control the first-stage servers and backdoors. Each cluster has a different C2 server structure, but the\nC2 servers for ThreatNeedle, Bookcode and CookieTime consist of similar components:\n\n - C2 script: script to control implant and forward commands from the second-stage server\n\n - Log file: saves connection logs from the implant\n\n - Configuration file: second-stage server address\n\nAlthough the structure of the C2 servers is similar, they still contain many differences. For example, while ThreatNeedle\nand Bookcode have similar C2 server structures, they utilize a different method when they deliver commands from the\nsecond-stage server and respond to the backdoor. The ThreatNeedle C2 server delivers that information using files, but the\nBookcode C2 server uses a global variable. In addition, the DeathNote C2 server has significant differences. The\nDeathNote C2 server, when faced with the downloader component, has files that contain allowed and blocked IP addresses.\nIf the conditions match, this script delivers the next-stage payload.\n\n|Clusters|Infection method|Malware component|\n|---|---|---|\n|AppleJeus|Trojanized application Spear phishing Contact through social media Use of Telegram channel|Installer, downloader, loader, backdoor|\n|ThreatNeedle|Spear phishing Trojanized application (a well-known program) Watering hole Contact through social media|Installer, downloader, loader, injector, backdoor|\n|DeathNote|Spear phishing Trojanized application (PDF reader)|Downloader, backdoor|\n|Bookcode|Watering hole Trojanized application (a security program)|Installer, injector, backdoor|\n|CookieTime|Spear phishing Trojanized application (a well-known program)|Downloader, loader, backdoor|\n|Mata|Exploit vulnerable network device|Loader, orchestrator, plug-ins|\n\n\n-----\n\n**Developer preference**\n\nEvery software developer has a preference for a particular development environment, and it’s the same for malware\ndevelopers. Some malware authors prefer to develop their malware under a particular OS environment and compiler\nversion. Many malware developers behind the Lazarus clusters still prefer Linker version 10, according to the metadata of\nthe malware. This means they usually used Visual Studio 2010 10.0. The novel malware cluster CookieTime uses the latest\nversion of the compiler, Visual Studio 2019 Version 16.7.\n\nThe compiler version from Rich Headers shows similar information. The fact that many malware developers behind the\nLazarus clusters used various different compiler versions and heavily relied on VS2010 SP1 build 40219, suggests that\ndifferent malware developers are working behind these clusters.\n\n|Clusters|Linker version from metadata|Representative compiler version from Rich Headers|\n|---|---|---|\n|AppleJeus|10, 14|VS2010 SP1 build 40219 VS2008 SP1 build 30729|\n|ThreatNeedle|10, 14|VS2010 build 30319 VS2013 build 21005 VS2010 SP1 build 40219|\n|DeathNote|12|VS2010 SP1 build 40219|\n|Bookcode|10|VS2008 SP1 build 30729|\n|CookieTime|10, 14.27|VS2010 SP1 build 40219|\n|Mata|14.14|VS2015 UPD3.1 build 24215|\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen a developer develops software, they usually use a public library or source code for common functionalities.\nGenerally, malware aims to compress the data sent to the C2 server to decrease the size. If the developer creates their code\nfor compression, it takes a lot of time and effort. So, they usually search public codes from the Internet and adapt them for\ntheir malware. In addition, malware developers tend to prefer specific modules for covert communication. The\nThreatNeedle cluster usually utilized the OpenSSL 0.9.8k library for SSL communication. However, the Mata malware\ndevelopers prefer the openssl-1.1.0f library.\n\n**Clusters** **zlib [10]** **Curl** **OpenSSL 0.9.8k** **openssl-1.1.0f** **SQLite Format 3**\n\nAppleJeus X X (macOS)\n\nThreatNeedle X X\n\nDeathNote X X\n\nBookcode X\n\nCookieTime\n\nMata X\n\n**Post-exploitation tactics**\n\nOnce an initial foothold has been acquired, the malware operator profiles the victim and collects additional information for\nfurther activities. The post-exploitation phase relies heavily on keyboard-hands-on activities, likely executing Windows\ncommands with specific options. Thus, we can identify the habits of the humans behind the attacks from this phase. In\naddition, each threat actor uses a unique strategy for a post-exploitation phase.\n\n - Generally speaking, each threat actor shows a different signature using the command line when working interactively\nvia an installed backdoor. As a result of comparing each Windows commands delivered by the Lazarus group, we can\nconfirm several differences for each cluster.\n\n - When checking network connection with the netstat command, the Bookcode cluster only uses -aon option, rather\nthan other clusters that use the -ano option.\n\n - Only the Bookcode cluster used the ESTA filtering option, whereas other clusters prefer the EST option.\n\n - Only the AppleJeus cluster uses the findstr command to filter the result rather than find.\n\n - When running the ping command, the malware operator behind the Bookcode cluster executes it with the -a -n 1\noption. On the other hand, another operator tends to prefer to use the -n 1 -a option.\n\n**Clusters** **Netstat commands** **Ping commands**\n\nAppleJeus netstat -ano | findstr **EST** ping -n 1 10.10.0.19\n\nnetstat -ano | find \"EST\" ping -n 1 -a 10.10.100.100\nThreatNeedle\nnetstat -ano | find \":445\" ping -n 1 -4 10.10.100.100\n\nnetstat -ano | find :445\nDeathNote N/A\nnetstat -ano | find **EST**\n\nnetstat -aon\nBookcode ping -a -n 1 10.10.20.67\nnetstat -aon | find \"ESTA\"\n\nCookieTime N/A ping -n 1 -a 10.1.10.192\n\nping -n 1 _[host name]_\nMata netstat -ano | find \"TCP\"\nping -n 1 -a 192.168.10.246\n\nIn the post-exploitation phase, each cluster carries out a different infiltration methodology. The malware operators behind\neach cluster utilize different tools and techniques to achieve their ultimate goals. All of the aforementioned technical\ndifferences demonstrate why we need to separate each Lazarus cluster as much as possible; that way, those attacked can\nrespond with the most effective defence strategy.\n\n|Clusters|zlib [10]|Curl|OpenSSL 0.9.8k|openssl-1.1.0f|SQLite Format 3|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|AppleJeus|X|X (macOS)||||\n|ThreatNeedle|X||X|||\n|DeathNote|X||||X|\n|Bookcode|X|||||\n|CookieTime||||||\n|Mata||||X||\n\n|Clusters|Netstat commands|Ping commands|\n|---|---|---|\n|AppleJeus|netstat -ano | findstr EST|ping -n 1 10.10.0.19|\n|ThreatNeedle|netstat -ano | find \"EST\" netstat -ano | find \":445\"|ping -n 1 -a 10.10.100.100 ping -n 1 -4 10.10.100.100|\n|DeathNote|netstat -ano | find :445 netstat -ano | find EST|N/A|\n|Bookcode|netstat -aon netstat -aon | find \"ESTA\"|ping -a -n 1 10.10.20.67|\n|CookieTime|N/A|ping -n 1 -a 10.1.10.192|\n|Mata|netstat -ano | find \"TCP\"|ping -n 1 [host name] ping -n 1 -a 192.168.10.246|\n\n\n-----\n\n|Clusters|Network scan|Credential access|Lateral movement|Create auxiliary access|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|AppleJeus||||Custom port opener Custom tunnelling tool|\n|ThreatNeedle|Wireshark|Responder [11]|SMB/Windows Admin Shares|Custom tunnelling tool|\n|DeathNote|Custom SMB scanner|Responder [11] ChromePass [12]|||\n|Bookcode|WakemeOnLan [13]|Responder [11] ADFind [14] BrowserPasswordRecoveryPro Manually SAM registry dump|SMB/Windows Admin Shares||\n|CookieTime|Custom SMB scanner|PWdump [15]|SMB/Windows Admin Shares||\n|Mata||Memory dumping|EternalBlue(MS17-010)||\n\n\n**Victimology**\n\nEvery threat actor has a target. Some threat actors target geopolitical intelligence and other groups covet financial profits.\nThe Lazarus group is one of few threat actors with extensive victimologies. Historically, the Lazarus group wanted to steal\ngovernment and diplomatic intelligence. However, later on, they began to aggressively attack financial institutions for\nfinancial profits. Each cluster under the Lazarus umbrella has its own victimology.\n\nThe AppleJeus cluster has intensively attacked cryptocurrency businesses only. On the other hand, most clusters have\ntargeted various industries. ThreatNeedle has an extensive target range and has quickly shifted its targets. ThreatNeedle first\nstrived to obtain financial profits, but, after early 2020, it shifted its target to the defence industry. Also, surprisingly, this\ncluster tried to compromise security researchers in early 2021 [16]. The DeathNote cluster changed its target with the\nThreatNeedle cluster. It focused on attacking cryptocurrency businesses early on, but it shifted to the defence industry from\nearly 2020 with the ThreatNeedle cluster. ThreatNeedle and DeathNote shifted their targets in a pretty similar time frame.\nThis means the two clusters have strong connections. The Bookcode cluster, meanwhile, heavily targeted software\ncompanies in South Korea. The operator behind the Bookcode cluster might, therefore, want to compromise the supply\nchain or source code. The CookieTime cluster, on the other hand, focused on the defence industry at an early stage and was\nthen discovered attacking a pharmaceutical company when countries were developing the Covid-19 vaccine competitively\n\n[17]. Unlike other clusters, Mata has different victimologies because its nature is similar to that of cybercrime groups. Mata\ncompromised small and medium-sized companies all over the globe and attempted to steal sensitive data related to their\ncustomers or to spread homemade ransomware.\n\n**AppleJeus** **ThreatNeedle** **DeathNote** **Bookcode** **CookieTime** **Mata**\n\nCryptocurrency businesses X X X\n\nDefence X X X\n\nS/W company X X\n\nSecurity researchers X\n\nPharmaceutical companies X X\n\nCybercrime-like target X\n\nOne more difference in victimology is the range of target countries. The Lazarus group has attacked South Korea\nprimarily because of geopolitical reasons. But some clusters attacked numerous countries around the world, excluding\nSouth Korea. While the Bookcode cluster was only discovered in South Korea, the AppleJeus, and Mata clusters\nattacked countries around the world except for South Korea. ThreatNeedle, DeathNote and CookieTime are not limited\nto any specific country.\n\n|Col1|AppleJeus|ThreatNeedle|DeathNote|Bookcode|CookieTime|Mata|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Cryptocurrency businesses|X|X|X||||\n|Defence||X|X||X||\n|S/W company||X||X|||\n|Security researchers||X|||||\n|Pharmaceutical companies||||X|X||\n|Cybercrime-like target||||||X|\n\n\n-----\n\n - South Korea only: Bookcode\n\n - Global excluding South Korea: AppleJeus, Mata\n\n - Global including South Korea: ThreatNeedle, DeathNote, CookieTime\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\nAny group or organization that we come across in our daily life has the ability to change its form and membership. Highly\nskilled threat actors, even state-sponsored groups, follow these simple principles. They may change internal members,\nstructure, or even leadership and, in doing so, they create changes in their capabilities and methodology. The notorious\nLazarus group has been active for a decade, and it’s apparent that the group has undergone many changes internally during\nthis period. In addition, active threat actors such as the Lazarus tend to evolve their tools and adopt novel technologies\naggressively. This means that the longer known threat groups are active, the harder it becomes to attribute new clusters of\nactivity to them, given that they have often retooled and reorganized old tools.\n\nEach security vendor, even each threat intelligence analyst, has a different standard for attribution. Despite the origin of the\ncyber attack being the same, each vendor can generate a different conclusion. As the scale and sophistication of cyber\nattacks by one group become greater and the changes more frequent, the gaps between vendors are increased. Lazarus\ngroup is an excellent example of this. When the security industry first started to shed light on this group, its was relatively\nsmall and didn’t have many clusters. But, now, it is a major threat actor with sufficient capabilities for attacking various\nindustries and with a highly sophisticated set of skills. Many security vendors have endeavoured to classify the group’s\nvarious campaigns but, in doing so, the gaps between security vendors’ understandings have become clear. Lazarus is not\nlikely to disappear from the threat landscape anytime soon, which means attribution will continue to be a complicated\nissue. By explaining our process for classifying various Lazarus clusters, we aim to close the gaps in individual vendors’\nknowledge. We need to be careful when drawing conclusions and share each other’s perspectives with an open mind. Also,\nwe need to look back at what we have discovered in the past to determine what we might have missed and reduce the\ndifference.\n\n**REFERENCES**\n\n[1] [Operation Blockbuster: https://operationblockbuster.com/.](https://operationblockbuster.com/)\n\n[2] [Kaspersky.
