    "plain_text": "# SBA phishing scams: from malware to advanced social engineering\n\n**[blog.malwarebytes.com/scams/2020/08/sba-phishing-scams-from-malware-to-advanced-social-engineering/](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/scams/2020/08/sba-phishing-scams-from-malware-to-advanced-social-engineering/)**\n\nJérôme Segura August 10, 2020\n\nA number of threat actors continue to take advantage of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic\nthrough phishing scams and other campaigns distributing malware.\n\nIn this blog, we look at 3 different phishing waves targeting applicants for Covid-19 relief\nloans. The phishing emails impersonate the US Small Business Administration (SBA), and\nare aimed at delivering malware, stealing user credentials or committing financial fraud.\n\nIn each of these campaigns, criminals are spoofing the sender’s email so that it looks like the\nofficial SBA’s. This technique is very common and unfortunately often misunderstood,\nresulting in many successful scams.\n\n## GuLoader malware\n\nIn April, we saw the first wave of SBA attacks using COVID-19 as a lure to distribute\nmalware. The emails contained attachments with names such as\n‘SBA_Disaster_Application_Confirmation_Documents_COVID_Relief.img’.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1: Spam email containing malicious attachment\n[The malware was the popular GuLoader, a stealthy downloader used by criminals to load the](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2020/07/malspam-campaign-caught-using-guloader-after-service-relaunch/)\npayload of their choice and bypass antivirus detection.\n\n## Traditional phishing attempt\n\nThe second wave we saw involved a more traditional phishing approach where the goal was\nto collect credentials from victims in order to scam them later on.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure\n\n2: Phishing email luring users to a site to enter their credentials\nA URL, especially if it has nothing to do with the sender, is a big giveaway that the email may\nbe fraudulent. But things get a little more complicated when attackers are using attachments\nthat look seemingly legitimate.\n\n## Advanced phishing attempt\n\nThis is what we saw in a pretty clever and daring scheme that tricks people into completing a\nfull form containing highly personal information, including bank account details. These could\nbe used to directly drain accounts or in an additional layer of social engineering, which tricks\nusers into paying in advanced fees that don’t exist as part of the real SBA program.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3: Phishing email containing a loan application form\nThis latest campaign started in early August and is convincing enough to fool even seasoned\nsecurity experts. Here’s a closer look at some red flags we encountered as we analyzed it.\n\n[Most people aren’t aware of email spoofing and believe that if the sender’s email matches](https://www.malwarebytes.com/spoofing/#what-are-the-types-of-spoofing)\nthat of a legitimate organization, it must be real. Unfortunately, that is not the case, and there\nare additional checks that need to be performed to confirm the authenticity of a sender.\n\nThere are various technologies for confirming the true sender email address, but we will\ninstead focus on the emails headers, a sort of blue print that is available to anyone.\nDepending on the email client, there are different ways to view such headers. In Outlook, you\ncan click File and then Properties to display them:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4: Email\n\nheaders showing suspicious sender\nOne of the items to look at is the “Received” field. In this case, it shows a hostname (parkmx.above[.]com) that looks suspicious. In fact, we can see it has already been mentioned in\n[another scam campaign.](http://www.circleid.com/posts/20200720-of-walmart-drive-in-movie-theater-domains-likely-typosquatting/)\n\nIf we go back to this email, we see that it contains an attachment, a loan application with the\n3245-0406 reference number. A look at the PDF metadata can sometimes reveal interesting\ninformation.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5: Suspicious load application form and its metadata\nHere we note the file was created on July 31 with Skia, a graphics library for Chrome. This\ntells us that the fraudsters created that form shortly before sending the spam emails.\n\nFor comparison, if we look at the application downloaded from the official SBA website, we\nsee some different metadata:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6: Official loan application form and its metadata\nThis legitimate application form was created used Acrobat PDFMaker for Word on March 27\nwhich coincides with the pandemic timeline.\n\nThe loan application would typically be printed out and then mailed to a physical address at\none of the government offices. If we go back to the original email, it asks to send the\ncompleted form as a reply via email instead:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7:\n\nReply email would send loan application form to criminals\nThis is where things get interesting. Even though the sender’s email is\ndisastercustomerservice@sba.gov, when you hit the reply button, it shows a different email\naddress at: disastercustomerservice@gov-sba[.]us. While sba.gov is the official and\nlegitimate government website, gov-sba[.]us is not.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8: Domain registered by scammers shortly before the attack\nThat domain name (gov-sba[.]us) was registered just days before the email campaign began\nand clearly does not belong to the US government.\n\nHowever, we should note that this campaign is quite elaborate and that it would be easy to\nfall for it. Sadly, the last thing you would want when applying for a loan is to be out of even\nmore money.\n\nIf you reply to this email with the completed form containing private information that includes\nyour bank account details, this is is exactly what would happen.\n\n## Tips on how to protect yourself\n\nThere is no question that people should be extremely cautious whenever they are asked to\nfill out information online—especially in an email. Fraudsters are lurking at every corner and\nready to pounce on the next opportunity.\n\nBoth the [Department of Justice and the](https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdnc/pr/beware-sba-loan-scams-government-officials-warn) [Small Business Administration have been warning of](https://www.sba.gov/document/report-sba-programs-scams-fraud-alerts)\nscams pertaining to SBA loans. Their respective sites provide various tips on how to steer\nclear of various malicious schemes.\n\nPerhaps the biggest takeaway, especially when it comes to phishing emails, is that the\nsender’s address can easily be spoofed and is in no way a solid guarantee of legitimacy,\neven if it looks exactly the same.\n\n\n-----\n\nBecause we can t expect everyone to be checking for email headers and metadata, at least\nwe can suggest double checking the legitimacy of any communication with a friend or by\nphoning the government organization. For the latter we always recommend to never dial the\nnumber found in an email or left on a voicemail, as it could be fake. Google the organization\nfor its correct contact number.\n\n[Malwarebytes also protects against phishing attacks and malware by blocking offending](http://www.malwarebytes.com/pricing)\ninfrastructure used by scammers.\n\n\n-----",
