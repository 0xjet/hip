Though Orcus has all the typical features of RAT malware, it\nallows users to build custom plugins and also has a modular architecture for better\nmanagement and scalability. The objective of this blog is to highlight some of the capabilities\nof this new RAT family and the impact seen so far.\n\n## Background\n\nBefore we discuss the details of this RAT family, let's discuss how Orcus became a\ncommercially sold RAT. Around October 2015, the developer of Orcus, going with the alias of\n“Sorzus”, posted a thread on a hacker forum about a RAT he was developing, soliciting\nfeedback on how it could be published. The developer had then named the tool as\n“Schnorchel”, German for “Snorkel”.\n\n_Figure 1 Sorzus discusses publishing Orcus_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe figure below shows the early versions of Orcus when it was being developed. It is\ninteresting to see that the developer details mentioned on the earlier version indicates\n\"Vincent (Alkalinee)\", and we are also aware that 'Alkalinee' was the alias which was being\nused by the developer before taking the new alias of 'Sorzus'. (This also suggests that the\nreal name of the Orcus developer may be 'Vincent'.)\n\n_Figure 2 Early version of Orcus which was known as “Schnorchel”_\n\nThe developer had shared intentions to publish the RAT for free and make it open-source.\nHowever, some of the users in the forum responded, advising to make it commercial instead\nof sharing it for free or making it open source, citing that the source code would eventually be\nused by others to repackage and sell it as a new RAT. One forum user, alias \"Armada\",\noffered to assist \"Sorzus\" on helping out with publishing the tool and apparently became\nSorzus' eventual partner.\n\n\"Sorzus\" and \"Armada\" are believed to be the two main individuals currently managing the\n[sales and development of Orcus. Brian Krebs published a blog a few weeks ago disclosing](http://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/07/canadian-man-is-author-of-popular-orcus-rat/)\ndetails of the individual who has been supposedly known to be the person behind Orcus. Our\nanalysis suggests that 'Sorzus' is the main developer of the RAT and 'Armada' is mostly\nresponsible for sales and support of the tool.\n\n## Architecture\n\nOrcus is developed using C# with the Windows administration/controller component\ndeveloped using WPS (Windows Presentation Foundation), which is used to render user\ninterfaces in Windows based systems. Orcus has three main components to its architecture:\nOrcus controller, Orcus Server and the trojan binary which is deployed on a victim machine.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe delivery vectors vary, ranging from a spear phishing attack using the malware binary\nwith the email, having a hyperlink with a download link to the Orcus malware binary, or even\nusing drive-by download methods.\n\nIn most RAT malware, once a victim has been infected, the malware connects back to the\nadmin panel of the attacker to send data and provide control to the infected machine.\nHowever, if a victim machine is infected with an Orcus RAT, it connects back to the Orcus\nserver which does not have the admin panel on it. Orcus has a separate component for the\nadmin panel (Orcus controller) which enables control of all infected machines from the Orcus\ncontroller. This set up offers multiple benefits to the cyber criminals using Orcus. For\nexample, they are able to share access to victim machines by accessing a single Orcus\nserver which would enable a group of cyber criminals working together to better manage\ntheir infected victim networks and also allow scalability of their Orcus network by deploying\nmultiple ‘Orcus servers’.\n\n_Figure 3 Orcus Architecture_\n\nThe developer not only has a controller build for Windows, but also created an Android app\nfor the admin controller to control the infected machines using an Android device. An Android\napp for the controller/administration component is also available from Google Play.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4 Orcus administration component for Android platform_\n\n## Unique Features\n\nBelow are some Orcus features that can enable full control of a victim machine:\n\nKeylogger\nScreengrabs\nRemote code execution\nWebcam monitor\nDisable webcam light\nMicrophone recorder\nRemote administration\nPassword stealers\nDenial of Service\nVM Detection\nInfoStealer\nHVNC\nReverse Proxy\nRegistry explorer/editor\nReal Time Scripting\nAdvanced Plugin System\n\n\n-----\n\nOrcus has many common features of a RAT, however the features which are unique and\nstand out the most is the ‘Plugin System’ and 'Real time scripting'. The plugin feature\nallows users of Orcus to build their own plugins or download plugins which have been\ndeveloped by the author. If a user has basic knowledge on one of the supported\nprogramming languages, which are C#, VB.Net or C++, that user can easily extend and write\nplugins to build on to the current capabilities of Orcus. The author also provides a developer\npackage to create the plugins with an IDE (Integrated Development Environment), which is\nan application used by programmers to develop programs.\n\nThe Orcus sellers also provide very well documented tutorials to create plugins, and also\n[maintain a Github page which has a few sample plugins created. Orcus allows seven](https://github.com/OrcusTechnologies)\ndifferent types of plugins to be created. Figure 5 shows the current list of plugin types that\ncan be built.\n\n_Figure 5 Types of plugins_\n\nThe libraries are well documented and are currently being hosted on 'sharpdox.de'.\nSharpdox is a tool to create C# code documentations and can be hosted on 'sharpdox.de'.\nFigure 6 shows an example of the methods or functions which are available to the Orcus\nplugin's 'ClientController' class.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6 Example of a plugin library documentation_\n\nThe Real Time scripting feature allows Orcus users to write and execute code (C#, VB.Net)\nin real time while remotely managing the compromised system.\n\n_Figure 7 Real time scripting feature on Orcus_\n\n## Analysis: Orcus Protections\n\n\n-----\n\nFrom an incident responder or threat analyst s perspective, it is important to understand the\ntype of anti-analysis protections a malware family employs so one is able to build an\nenvironment to successfully analyze the malware. This blog is not intended to discuss\nreverse-engineering the RAT in detail; however, it is interesting to see some of the antianalysis features which Orcus employs to avoid being detected in a standard analysis\nenvironment.\n\nWe reverse-engineered one of the Orcus samples seen on a recent attack to check and\nverify some of the configured features. Given Orcus is developed in C# / VB.Net, we can\neasily peek into the code using a .NET disassembler. If an Orcus user enables the\nVMDetection feature while building the malware binary, the malware would check if the\nmalware is running within a virtual machine environment. The virtual machines that Orcus\ndetects are ParallelsDesktop, VirtualBox, VirtualPC and VMWare. The figure below shows\nthe code excerpt for detecting the presence of virtual machines.\n\n_Figure 8 Virtual Machine detection in Orcus_\n\nOrcus also checks for processes of network monitoring tools like Netmon, TCPView and\nWireshark as shown in the figure below.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 9 Detection for network analysis tools_\n\n## Impact\n\nFigure 10 below shows the trending graph seen in Autofocus on the number of malware\ndownload sessions for Orcus. Given the feature rich toolset and the scalability Orcus\nprovides, it is not a surprise that the usage and acceptance of the Orcus RAT is growing\namong cyber criminals since being first sold early this year. Given the increasing popularity\nof Orcus, it is likely that we will see more cyber crime campaigns where the RAT of choice is\nOrcus.\n\n_Figure 10 Autofocus graph of Orcus download sessions over time_\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe individuals behind Orcus are selling the RAT by advertising it as a \"Remote\nAdministration Tool\" under a supposedly registered business and claiming that this tool is\nonly designed for legitimate business use. However, looking at the feature capabilities,\narchitecture of the tool, and the publishing and selling of the tool in hacker forums, it is clear\nthat Orcus is a malicious tool, and that its target customer is cyber criminals. It's not\nuncommon but this is an interesting case where a developer with an initial intention to\nrelease the code for free or open source, ends up in collaborating with an individual in a\n\n\n-----\n\nhacker forum who has prior experience in building and selling similar malicious tools, and\ncreates a commercial RAT which has started to gain wide acceptance among cyber criminals\nwith its unique feature set and flexible architecture.\n\nPalo Alto Networks WildFire correctly identifies Orcus as malicious and AutoFocus\n[customers can track this threat using the Orcus tag.](https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.Orcus)\n\n## IOCs:\n\n[The current list of hashes for Orcus samples can be found on the Unit 42 github page here.](https://github.com/pan-unit42/iocs/blob/master/orcus/hashes.txt)\n\n**Get updates from**\n\n**Palo Alto**\n\n**Networks!**\n\nSign up to receive the latest news, cyber threat intelligence and research from us\n\n[By submitting this form, you agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge our Privacy](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/legal-notices/terms-of-use)\nStatement.\n\n\n-----",
