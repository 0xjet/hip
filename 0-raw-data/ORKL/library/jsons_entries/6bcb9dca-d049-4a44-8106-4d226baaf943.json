The job was made easier as malware\nleftover from previous attacks on the same targets had not been fully eradicated.\n\nThe attackers have been tracked in attempts to use stolen credentials to access a target\nnetwork. In some examples, endpoints were still compromised from past attacks, and this\nwas leveraged to access the victim's internal network and covertly establish a connection to\nthe group's command-and-control (C2) server.\n\nA vulnerability in the DLP tool was then used to perform DLL hijacking. As the software failed\nto verify the integrity of DLLs it was loading, the malicious file was launched with a high level\nof privilege.\n\nThis DLL then injected shellcode into various Windows system services, allowing the\nWaterbear loader to deploy additional malicious packages.\n\nAnother interesting facet of the loader is the \"resurrection\" of a decade-old antivirus evasion\ntechnique, according to the researchers.\n\n[Known as \"Heaven's Gate,\" the misdirection technique is used to trick Microsoft Windows](https://www.zdnet.com/article/malware-authors-are-still-abusing-the-heavens-gate-technique/)\noperating systems into executing 64-bit code, even when declared as a 32-bit process. This,\nin turn, can be used to bypass security engines and to inject shellcode.\n\n**CNET:** [Privacy push could banish some annoying website popups and online tracking](https://www.cnet.com/news/privacy-effort-could-banish-some-annoying-website-popups-and-online-tracking/?ftag=CMG-01-10aaa1b)\n\n\"Just as 64-bit and 32-bit programs are quite different, so are analysis mechanisms. Malware\nequipped with Heaven's Gate contains both 64-bit and 32-bit parts,\" the team says.\n\"Therefore, some monitor/analysis systems will only apply 32-bit analysis and will fail the 64bit part; thus, this approach will break some monitor/analysis mechanisms.\"\n\nTo scupper analysis attempts, the Waterbear loader will also use RC4 encryption on its main\npayload and \"pad contents [and memory] from Kernel32.dll in front of and behind shellcode.\"\nThe size of the malware's binary was also inflated in an attempt to bypass file-based\nscanners.\n\n**TechRepublic:** [Cybersecurity Awareness Month: How to protect your kids from identity theft](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/cybersecurity-awareness-month-how-to-protect-your-kids-from-identity-theft/?ftag=CMG-01-10aaa1b)\n\nIn August, the CyCraft team told virtual attendees of Black Hat USA that a Chinese\n[advanced persistent threat (APT) group has been striking the systems of Taiwanese chip](https://www.zdnet.com/article/black-hat-hackers-are-now-using-cobalt-strike-and-skeleton-keys-to-target-semiconductor-firms/)\nmanufacturers.\n\nSensitive corporate information and property including semiconductor designs, source code,\nand software development kits (SDKs) have been stolen in \"precise and well-coordinated\nattacks\" over 2018 and 2019. At least seven separate vendors have fallen prey to the group.\n\n**The biggest hacks, data breaches of 2020 (so far)**\n\n\n-----\n\n### Previous and related coverage\n\n**Have a tip?
