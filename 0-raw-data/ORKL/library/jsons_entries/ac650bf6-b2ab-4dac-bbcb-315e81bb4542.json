Initial impacted broadcaster were KBS, MBC and YTN, and impacted banks\nwere Cheju, Nonghyup and Shinhan.\n\nBut by analyzing all the events related to this cyber attack we can see that the campaign was\nmore extended in time as mentioned and also more complex to understand. The campaign is\ncomposed by different samples, created potentially by different authors with different\nobjectives. We can divide the reported samples in different categories:\n\n**Wipe: Objective of these samples is to erase all data’s of affected targets.**\n**Drop & Wipe: Objective of these samples is to drop a wiper to erase all data’s of**\naffected targets.\n**Drop & Wipe & Deface: Objectives of these samples are to drop a wiper to erase all**\ndata’s and deface website hosted by affected targets.\n**Drop & Backdoor: Objective of these samples is to install a backdoor, or trojan, on the**\naffected targets.\n**Unknown: These samples are potentially not related to the campaign.**\n\nI will try, through this blog post, to provide you the most reliable information’s as possible\nregarding the Dark South Korea campaign.\n\nAccording to different sources, and announced by the South Korean security\n[provider AhnLab the Thursday 21 March, “bad guys” got access to](https://marketwire.com/press-release/media-alert-hackers-set-time-bomb-set-damage-targeted-banks-broadcasters-south-korea-kosdaq-053800-1771229.htm) _[AhnLab Policy Center](https://global.ahnlab.com/en/site/product/productSubDetail.do?prod_type=NM&prod_class=N&prod_seq=502)_\n[and HAURI ViRobot ISMS, asset management tools, through stolen credentials in order to](http://www.globalhauri.com/product/product_view.html?product_uid=NDc=)\n[massively spread Trojan.Jokra.

These files are “alg.exe“, “conime.exe“,\n“~pr1.tmp” and “AgentBase.exe“.\n\n“alg.exe” (e45cd9052dd3dd502685dfd9aa2575ca) is the “plink.exe” [PuTTY tool acting as a](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html)\ncommand-line interface to the PuTTY back ends. This binary has been compiled the 201302-15 at 08:12:58.\n\n“conime.exe” (6a702342e8d9911bde134129542a045b) is the “pscp.exe” PuTTY tool acting\nas a SCP client, i.e. command-line secure file copy. This binary has been compiled the 200603-13 at 14:32:44.\n\n[“~pr1.tmp” (dc789dee20087c5e1552804492b042cd) is a bash script who will be dropped](https://pastebin.com/QWNJjEtQ)\nand executed on *NIX servers in certain conditions.\n\n“AgentBase.exe” (db4bbdc36a78a8807ad9b15a562515c4) is the wiper mentioned in the\nprevious chapters of this blog post.\n\nAfter installing these files, the dropper will check the presence of “~v3.log” file in\n“C:\\WINDOWS\\Temp\\” directory.\n\nIf the file “~v3.log” is not existing “AgentBase.exe” wiper will be executed, killing AhnLab\nPolicy Agent (pasvc.exe) and Hauri ViRobot ISMS Client (clisvc.exe), then erasing all data’s.\n\nIf the file “~v3.log” is existing, the dropper start to check the presence of configuration file\n“confCons.xml” of **[mRemote program, developed by Felix Deimel, and the presence of](http://www.royalts.com/main/home/mRemote.aspx)**\n[configuration files of SecureCRT program, developed by VanDyke Software, Inc.](https://www.vandyke.com/products/securecrt/index.html)\n\n\n-----\n\nFor mRemote, the dropper copy all data s, related to SSH connexions with root login,\npresent in “confCons.xml” configuration file and exploit a vulnerability present in the\npassword storage engine of this program. When you save connections in mRemote it\noutputs all of that data into an XML report “confCons.xml“. The passwords are saved in an\nencrypted format, however this is trivial to circumvent. So despite the passwords are saved\nin encrypted format it is easy to decrypt them. This vulnerability was discovered and\n[published by Cosine Security the 2 Jun 2011. Support of mRemote has been stopped in](https://cosine-security.blogspot.com/2011/06/stealing-password-from-mremote.html)\n2012.\n\nOnce the mRemote vulnerability is exploited, the dropper start a new process to execute\n“conime.exe” binary, in order to drop the “~pr1.tmp” file into “/tmp/cups” on the targeted\nserver:\n\n“C:\\Users\\ERICRO~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\conime.exe -batch -P 22 -l root -pw test\n_C:\\Users\\ERICRO~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\~pr1.tmp 192.168.178.54:/tmp/cups”_\n\nAfter upload of “cups” file, the dropper will execute this file through the following command.\n\n“C:\\Users\\ERICRO~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\conime.exe -batch -P 22 -l root -pw test\n_192.168.178.54 “chmod 755 /tmp/cups;/tmp/cups”_\n\nFor SecureCRT, the dropper is also copying all data’s, related to SSH connexions with root\nlogin, present in “*.ini” configuration files. Each saved connection in SecureCRT as it ones\n“*.ini” file who will be parsed by the dropper. The passwords are also saved in an encrypted\nformat.\n\nWith the latest version of SecureCRT (7.0.3), the dropper is unable to decrypt the password,\nbut will try to connect to targeted servers with a wrong password. So there is surely a similar\nvulnerability as for mRemote in previous versions of SecureCRT, but wasn’t able to find it.\n\n\n-----",
