The group has been commissioned to use their international contacts\nand expertise to obtain personal protective equipment (PPE) such as face masks and\n[medical gear, particularly from China-based supply and purchasing chains.](https://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/coronavirus-covid-19-vw-bundesregierung-1.4866977)\n\nIBM X-Force IRIS’ research indicates that the threat actors behind this campaign targeted\nmore than 100 high ranking executives in management and procurement roles within this\norganization and its third-party ecosystem. Overall, IBM X-Force IRIS observed\napproximately 40 organizations being targeted in this campaign. Given the extensive\ntargeting observed of this supply chain, it’s likely that additional members of the task force\ncould be targets of interest in this malicious campaign, requiring increased vigilance. IBM XForce IRIS has notified CERT BUND about this activity to further ensure members are\naware.\n\nThis discovery represents a precision-targeting campaign exploiting the race to secure\nessential PPE. Based on our analysis, attackers likely intended to compromise a single\ninternational company’s global procurement operations, along with their partner\nenvironments devoted to a new government-led purchasing and logistics structure.\n\n## Targeting New Medical Equipment Procurement Structures\n\nOn 30 March 2020, German government officials met with several top German MNCs to\n[establish new ‘framework agreements’ to commission these nine companies to leverage their](https://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/coronavirus-covid-19-vw-bundesregierung-1.4866977)\naccess to foreign markets to purchase and facilitate the delivery of PPE on behalf of various\nGerman Ministries.\n\nOur research shows that, on this same date, suspicious activity from a Russia-based IP\naddress toward the MNC began. Specifically, IBM X-Force IRIS discovered over 280 URLs\ntied to the suspicious Russia-based IP address 178[.]159[.]36[.]183, with more than a third\nincluding Base64 encoded email addresses belonging to suspected targets at the MNC and\nits third-party supply chain partners. Approximately half of the encoded email accounts\nbelong to executives associated with operations, finance, and procurement within the\ntargeted corporation. The remaining half belong to executives at third-party partners,\nincluding European and American companies associated with chemical manufacturing,\naviation and transport, medical and pharmaceutical manufacturing, finance, oil and gas, and\ncommunications.\n\nAs of the time of publication, this campaign remains an ongoing operation.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Credential Harvesting\n\nIBM X-Force IRIS discovered that the URLs redirect the target emailed to a fake, actorcontrolled Microsoft login page designed to steal and exfiltrate user credentials to several\ndifferent Yandex email accounts.\n\nIt is unclear how many of these phishing attacks were successful, however through\ncredential harvesting, threat actors could gain access to the victims’ email accounts with the\npotential to collect or exfiltrate data of interest, and/or move laterally through the network to\nfulfill other actions on objectives.\n\n_Figure 1: Fake Login Page_\n\n_Figure 2: Actor-owned email account embedded in the HTML_\n\n## Global Race for Resources\n\nA global rush to obtain essential PPE for health care personnel has resulted in an\n[unprecedented leap in prices and competition for now-critical medical resources. To secure](https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/16/politics/ppe-price-costs-rising-economy-personal-protective-equipment/index.html)\nvital supplies, nations across the globe have launched a bevy of national buying programs,\nemergency state export statutes, and contracting initiatives to acquire the essential\nequipment to address the rapid spread of coronavirus.\n\n\n-----\n\nGiven the worldwide spread of COVID-19 and fears of a pending second wave of infection, it\nis highly likely criminal and state-sponsored actors alike will seek to exploit global\nprocurement and supply chains with the intention of either profiting from the crisis or\nsupporting the acquisition activities of their host nation.\n\n## Preparation, Planning and Practice\n\nIn this extraordinary time, many organizations across the globe are being called upon to\nperform essential tasks to outfit, equip and support medical professionals on the frontlines of\na global crisis. These companies are now part of an emerging high value target group whose\nreliance on digital technology to enable business practices provides a potential means of\ncompromise to malicious cyber actors. Now, perhaps more than ever, businesses must have\n[an actionable Incident Response Plan in place to prevent, react and recover from a cyber](https://securityintelligence.com/why-you-should-practice-and-drill-to-prepare-for-a-cyber-emergency/)\nemergency.\n\nIOCs associated with this campaign are available via our Enterprise Intelligence\nManagement platform.\n\nThis campaign also underscores the need for organizations to address the risks from\nphishing attacks. Phishing was the initial infection vector in nearly one-third of all cyber\nincidents we investigated last year. Please read our previously published blog “State of the\nPhish: IBM X-Force Reveals Current Phishing Attack Trends” to review ways to help mitigate\nthis threat.\n\n[Phishing |](https://securityintelligence.com/tag/phishing/) [X-Force](https://securityintelligence.com/tag/x-force/)\n[Claire Zaboeva](https://securityintelligence.com/author/claire-zaboeva/)\nSenior Strategic Cyber Threat Analyst, IBM\n\nClaire is a Senior Strategic Cyber Threat Analyst on the Threat Hunt & Discovery Team\nwithin IBM X-Force.
