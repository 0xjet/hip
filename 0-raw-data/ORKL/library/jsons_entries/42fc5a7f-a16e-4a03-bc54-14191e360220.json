In addition to\nthe source code for two versions of the malicious application along with the control panel\nbeing freely available on various underground forums, over two hundred injection files, those\nbeing HTML pages that mimic the look of legitimate Android apps, have been distributed and\ncould allow the theft of credentials and/or payment card data.\n\nGiven that the current threat from Cerberus was countered by Google Play Protect, Google’s\nown Android antimalware solution, other threat actors may act on comments from Cerberus’\ncreators to restore the threat, or simply use the source code to create, or further develop,\ntheir own Android threats.\n\nRecent reports indicate that Cerberus is now targeting Android users in Russia as well as\ncountries within the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), suggesting that some ‘lesspatriotic’ threat groups have modified the source code and removed these previously defined\n‘safe countries’. Other than this activity, no other regions have been specifically identified at\nincreased risk.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs time elapses and threat actors gain a better understanding of the released code, others\nmay seek to utilize it, or the injection pages, in their own threats or campaigns. This is\nespecially true given the availability of a Cerberus ‘installation service’, costing just USD 300,\nthat could allow a lower-sophistication threat actor to gain access to a working Cerberus\ncontrol panel with Android application package (APK) builder for a fraction of its former cost.\n\n## Introduction\n\nBelieved to have been in development for some time and used privately for around two years\nprior to being first observed by cybersecurity researchers in June 2019, Cerberus is an\nAndroid banking trojan that was available via a malware-as-as-service (Maas) offering as\nadvertised on underground forums (Figure 1).\n\n_Figure 1 – Cerberus advertisement banners (Bottom: Updated for Cerberus V2)_\n\nAs is common for threats of this nature, Cerberus supports various capabilities out-of-thebox, such as the ability to interact with, and steal data from, a compromised device including\ncontacts, SMS interception and call forwarding, as well as selling addons in the form of\n‘injections’ that allow credentials and/or payment card data to be stolen from specific\nlegitimate applications.\n\nReportedly earning the creators at least USD 10,000 a month during its peak, not\nwithstanding any ill-gotten gains made from stolen data, the MaaS model used to rent\naccess to Cerberus’ infrastructure was, when not discounted (Figure 2), available in three\npackages (USD 4,000 for 3 months, USD 7,000 for 6 months and USD 12,000 for one year\nof access) in addition to injections reportedly selling for USD 4,000 each.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2 – Cerberus ‘Winter Sale’_\n\nHaving purchased a licence, nefarious users would gain access to the Cerberus control\npanel which allowed them to build an Android application package (Figure 3), in the form of\nan ‘APK’ file ready for distribution to victims, as well as providing them with the ability to\nmanage their compromised devices and access any stolen data (Figure 4).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3 – Cerberus APK builder (added to the platform in July 2019)\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4 – Cerberus Control Panel_\n\nHaving configured and generated an APK payload file, threat actors would then need to\ndeliver this to victims likely through the use of social engineering tactics and campaigns such\nas ‘fake media player’ messages shown to Android users visiting a compromised or\nmalicious website (Figure 5) as well as fake mobile apps uploaded to various app stores and\neven the use of COVID-19 themes during the global pandemic.\n\n_Figure 5 – Cerberus distributed via fake Adobe Flash Player (Credit: ESET Research)_\n\nReportedly one of the most successful Android banking trojans and MaaS threats of 2019\nand into 2020, Cerberus’ reign came to a somewhat abrupt end in August 2020 with the\ncreator citing ‘internal issues’ that prevented ongoing development and undoubtedly\ncontributed to the threat being detected and blocked by Google’s built-in antimalware\nprotection ‘Google Play Protect’.\n\n## Attempted Sale\n\n\n-----\n\nWhilst still in development as late as 21 July 2020, seemingly the period between 22 and 26\nJuly 2020 saw Cerberus being detected by Google Play Protect and customers taking to the\nforum to complain about their ‘bots dropping off’.\n\nIn response to these complaints, ‘Android’, Cerberus’ creator or the group’s spokesperson,\nsuggested on 28 July 2020 that the threat was still operational, albeit requiring the use of a\n‘cryptor’ to prevent detection (Figure 6).\n\n_Figure 6 – ‘Android’ responding in English, rather than Russian, to various complaints about_\n_Cerberus on 28 July 2020_\n\nTools known as ‘cryptors’ are often used by malware authors and utilize various encryption\nroutines to thwart the analysis of malicious binaries as well as obfuscating or modifying their\ncode to evade detection signatures. In this instance, it appears that the solution to Cerberus’\nproblems was not as simple as using a ‘cryptor’ and was promptly followed by the group\nceasing development following ‘internal issues’.\n\nIn addition to the threat group reportedly disbanding, with existing Ceberus infections being\nin-operational due to their detection, the malware-as-a-service (MaaS) offering, including all\nsource code, installation guides, and setup scripts along with details of current and\nprospective customers, was reportedly offered for auction at the end of July 2020 with a\nstarting price of USD 50,000 and a ‘buy-it-now’ price of USD 100,000.\n\nAppearing somewhat steeply priced, it is likely that a suitably motivated and skilled threat\nactor could have recouped their outlay within a year, especially given the reported USD\n10,000 monthly earnings, although, given that the auction failed to find a buyer, the ‘market’\ndidn’t agree with this valuation or the viability of Cerberus following its detection by Google\nPlay Protect.\n\n## Source Code Release\n\nFollowing the failed auction attempt, and potentially in an attempt to restore confidence in the\ngroup, ‘Android’ posted a message to the ‘XSS[.]is’ forum on 5 August 2020 to confirm that\nthey would be fulfilling any financial commitments to existing customers, presumably by\nrefunding them any access payments, and that the source code would be made available to\nthe forum’s members (Figure 7).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7 – Forum post indicating the release of the Cerberus Source Code to members of\nXSS[.]is\n\nTranslation:\n\nv2 version. Flipper.\n\nSince our team (before that the team) ran this business cleanly, as beautifully as possible,\nwe will finish it beautifully.\n\nFor 70% of clients, financial obligations have already been closed. The remaining ones are\nasked to unsubscribe in a PM or Telegram, do not forget to write your Jabber, the license key\nand the server IP. This is so that I can be sure that you are the owner of the license. It is also\nadvisable to attach the APK file.\n\nSources to be torn apart, especially for xss[.]is\n\nCerberus v1 + Cerberus v2 + install scripts + admin panel + sql db\n\nSeemingly available on various underground forums from around 7 August 2020, a\nsubsequent post by ‘Android’ on the XSS[.]is forum on 10 August 2020 included a cleanedup archive (Figure 8).\n\nFigure 8 – Cerberus source code release on XSS[.]is\n\nTranslation:\n\nGuys, and wrap-up.\n\n\n-----\n\nCerberus v1 + Cerberus v2 + install scripts + admin panel + sql db\n\nArchive cleared of garbage.\n\nEverything for those who want to start their own business. Full pack.\nIn the header, I replaced the link to it.\n\nFor moderators, please re-upload to other [file sharing services] so that the file will live for a\nlong time.\n\nAnalysis of the source code archive indicates that the directories have modification dates of\n5 August 2020, confirming the archive creation of the file that aligns with the forum posts,\nwhilst the files, excluding any open-source libraries used, have various modification dates\nbetween 31 March 2019 and July 21 2020, again consistent with what is known about\nCerberus’ recent development.\n\n**_Note: For reference, sample file hashes for the released Cerberus source code are provided_**\n_in Appendix A._\n\nIncluded within the main archive are four main directories:\n```\n   moduleBot2 – Java source code and assets for the Cerberus v2 Android payload\n\n```\nincluding build files for use with the ‘Gradle’ build automation tool. Based on application\nicons found within the directory structure, the threat appears to mimic a ‘Santander’\nbanking app but it is understood that this would be customizable when using the\n‘builder’ control panel.\n```\n   panel_v2 – HTML, JavaScript and PHP source code for the server that provides the\n\n```\nCerberus control panel, APK payload builder and the command and control (C2) callhome ‘gate.php’ script. Notably, the payload builder takes parameters from the threat\nactor and then executes the Gradle build automation tool before allowing the payload\nto be downloaded. Additionally, ‘cryptor’ code appears within this directory that could\nallow payloads to thwart analysis or detection albeit, based on the Google Play Protect\ndetection, this has been countered.\n```\n   restapi_v2 – Seemingly allowing interactions between bots and the C2\n\n```\nserver/control panel, the REST API directory includes PHP code and provides an\ninsight into the status of a bot including the relatively short period of time elapsed for it\nto be considered ‘dead’ (albeit understandable given that most people will keep their\nmobile phone online at all times):\n```\n      0 – Online (Bot has been visible within the last 2 minutes);\n      1 – Offline (Bot has been visible within the 40hrs but not last 2 minutes);\n      2 – Dead (Bot has not been seen within the last 40hrs);\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n   source_mmm – Java source code and assets for the Cerberus v1 Android payload,\n\n```\nagain including build files for use with the ‘Gradle’ build automation tool.\nFurthermore, a SQL dump file is included within the archive and provides an insight\ninto the backend database behind the Cerberus control panel. In addition to this\ndatabase backup detailing the data stored on bots and compromised hosts, base64encoded ‘injects’ are included to mimic and steal credentials or payment card data by\nposing as the following Android applications:\n\nConnect for Hotmail & Outlook ( com.connectivityapps.hotmail )\nGmail ( com.google.android.gm )\nImo ( com.imo.android.imoim )\nInstagram ( com.instagram.android )\n[mail.com Mail ( com.mail.mobile.android.mail )](http://mail.com/)\nMicrosoft Outlook ( com.microsoft.office.outlook )\nSnapchat ( com.snapchat.android )\nTelegram ( org.telegram.messenger )\nTwitter ( com.twitter.android )\nUber ( com.ubercab )\nViber Messenger ( com.viber.voip )\nWeChat ( com.tencent.mm )\nWhatsApp Messenger ( com.whatsapp )\nYahoo Mail ( com.yahoo.mobile.client.android.mail )\n\n## Current Capabilities\n\nWhilst the immediate threat from Cerberus has been countered by Google Play Protect, the\nrelease of the source code provides other threat actors with the ability to analyse and\nunderstand how Cerberus’ modular capabilities were implemented, potentially allowing\nothers to extend them or reuse the code in other Android threats.\n\nAs is to be expected of a successful Android threat, Cerberus claims to work on devices\nusing Android 5 or later and, have gained ‘accessibility’ permissions, can automatically\npermit additional permissions for itself including:\n```\n   android.permission.INTERNET ;\n   android.permission.CALL_PHONE ;\n   android.permission.REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS ;\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n   android.permission.WAKE_LOCK ;\n\n```\nGiven these permissions, many capabilities can be identified, such as those that are\nconsistent with a remote access trojan gaining access to, and control over, the device:\n\nScreenshot and audio recording;\nKeylogging from within applications;\nAccess and exfiltrate contacts;\nDevice location tracking;\nApplication download, execution and removal;\nDevice lock;\nMute all device sound and disable vibrate alerts;\n\nAdditionally, specific banking trojan capabilities provide the means to gather credentials and\npayment card data as well as thwarting additional security measures such as one-time\npasswords, multi-factor authentication and voice calls:\n\nAccess, send, receive and delete SMS (ideal for capturing one-time passwords);\nCall forwarding (potentially allowing the interception of voice calls);\nCredential and payment card data theft through application injections;\nLocal installation and automatic (timed) enable of injections to allow operation with\nlimited network coverage;\nTheft of multi-factor authentication codes from Google Authenticator;\n\nIn an attempt to evade security controls and thwart analysis, Cerberus implemented antiemulator code to ensure that it was only executed on a valid physical device, attempted to\ndisable Google Play Protect, albeit until its detection, and provided a self-destruct\nmechanism to remove traces of the bot to prevent post-incident analysis.\n\nFinally, command and control (C2) traffic is RC4 encrypted and base64-encoded using a\nrandom key. Subsequently, ‘call home’ communications include useful data about the device\nwhich is viewable within the control panel:\n\nAndroid operating system version;\nBattery status;\nDevice manufacturer/model;\nIP address;\nNetwork operator;\nTelephone number;\nSystem locale (Country and language);\nScreen status (Locked or Unlocked);\nGoogle Play Protect status;\nSMS intercept status;\nAvailability of bank, card and email credentials/data;\n\n\n-----\n\nInfection date and bot up-time;\nTelephone activity, used to determine if it is an emulator;\n\nFeatures: hide SMS, lock device, mute sound, keylogger, injection\n\n## Injections\n\nCerberus makes use of ‘injections’ to target legitimate applications, including those related to\nbanking, email, messaging, retail and social media, with pages that mimic the targeted\napplication interface and prompt for credentials and/or payment card details from the victim\n(Figure 9).\n\n_Figure 9 – Example ‘injects’ mimicking legitimate application interfaces_\n\nThese HTML-based injects are provided as a single file asset, allowing them to be easily\nstored within the command and control (C2) database and distributed to victim devices,\nintegrating cascading style sheets (CSS) to ensure the layout is consistent with the targeted\napplication as well as embedding base64-encoded images (Figure 10).\n\n_Figure 10 – Example embedded base64-encoded PNG image within the inject HTML file_\n\nOnce deployed, a victim would be presented with the inject when attempting to access a\ntargeted application and, assuming they fall for the ruse, the data entered is inserted into a\nJSON data structure ready for exfiltration by Cerberus to the C2 infrastructure.\n\n\n-----\n\nSeemingly a starter kit was offered by Cerberus with a handful of injections to target Italy,\nFrance, Turkey and the United States, whilst additional injections could be purchased (Figure\n11).\n\n_Figure 11 – Cerberus ‘Tweet’ indicating the sale of injects_\n\nNotably, in addition to base64-encoded injects embedded within the SQL dump file\ndistributed with the Cerberus control panel source code, archives of this recent release\ndistributed on underground forums include over 200 additional inject files potentially including\nsome that would have previously been charged for.\n\n**_Note: For reference, a full list of the injects distributed with the Cerberus source code are_**\n_provided in Appendix B._\n\nGiven that these inject files mimic many current mobile applications, the release of this large\nset could allow other malware authors to incorporate them into their own mobile threats as\nwell as being of use to any threat actor that can make use of, or further develop, the\nCerberus source code.\n\n## Potential Future Developments\n\n Increased Targeting\n\n\n-----\n\nAs is common with cybercrime threats originating from Russia or countries within the\nCommonwealth of Independent States (CIS), threat actors will only target victims in other\ncountries as confirmed by a string variable within Cerberus’ source code containing a safe\nlist of country codes:\n\n```\npublic String strCIS = \"[ua][ru][by][tj][uz][tm][az][am][kz][kg][md]\";\n\n```\n\nSince the public release of Cerberus’ source code, other seemingly less-patriotic threat\nactors have removed or modified this restriction and there is now reportedly an increase in\nvictims within Russia and CIS countries.\n\nAside than this shift in targeting, no other region has been identified as suffering from\nincreased attacks although, with time, other threat actors may seek to leverage their access\nto the source code and potentially launch attacks in regions where Android devices are\nprevalent whilst less likely to be protected by current versions of Google Play Protect.\n\n## Variants\n\nIn addition to threat actors taking the Cerberus source code ‘as-is’ and attempting to launch\ntheir own campaigns, especially given that an ‘enterprising’ user on the XSS[.]is forum is\noffering an installation service for just USD 300 (Figure 12), others may seek to build upon\nthe existing code or create their own variants to resolve the issues that caused Google Play\nProtect to detect the threat.\n\n_Figure 12 – XSS[.]is forum member offering proof of their Cerberus install service_\n\n\n-----\n\nOne such example that has been reported as a variant of Cerberus is a threat dubbed Alien\nalthough, both the creators of Alien and Cerberus have denied any link between the two.\n\nProviding any would-be successor with the necessary information to resolve Cerberus’\nissues, two suggestions are given to counter Google Play Protect’s ability to scan application\nresources (Figure 13).\n\nFigure 13 – Denial of link to ‘Alien’ and Cerberus ‘solution’ proposals\nTranslation:\n\nAlien is based entirely on Anubis.\n\nOur bot died due to one problem, the play-protection started scanning the resources of the\nAPK file.\n\nInitially, Cerberus was developed as a modular bot, loading malicious code into resources,\nand at that time Play Protect was unable to scan application resources.\n\nAt the moment, our module has signatures, and bots “die” when it is loaded. The solution is\nto remove the module from the code and encrypt the entire APK, but then the size of the\nAPK will be very large.\n\nSolution number two: encrypt the module.\n\nWhy didn’t we do it?\n\nWe had one module for all clients, and since the team was crumbling, it was not possible to\nfind new programmers who would make their own module for each client individually.\n\nAs a result, our clients could not encrypt the module for themselves. We encrypted the\nmodule 5 times, and each crypt fell the next day according to the signatures, and in the end\nour hands dropped, since this is not a solution to the problem.\n\nWhilst it is likely only a matter of time before a suitably skilled nefarious developer resolves\nthe issues with Cerberus, the release of the source code will undoubtedly assist the Google\nPlay Protect team in creating countermeasures. That being said, organizations should still\nencourage users to, and individuals should, be cautious whenever prompted to install\nAndroid packages (APK) from unverified sources, be that a browser pop-up, an email or from\na third-party app marketplace.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Appendix A – Samples\n\nThe following SHA-256 file hashes relate to the leaked files, as observed on multiple\nunderground forums, and may prove beneficial to security professionals wishing to perform\ntheir own analysis of the threat:\n\nInitial source code release `cerberus_full_package.7z`\n```\n

of compromise (IOC) related to past\nCerberus threats are somewhat redundant although the command and control (C2) Tor\nhidden service still appears to be accessible via `cerberesfgqzqou7.onion (Figure 14).`\n\n_Figure 14 – Cerberus control panel Tor hidden service_\n\n\n-----\n\nAdditionally, the following HTTP command and control (C2) communication strings were\nobserved within the source
