Not a particularly ground-breaking statement. But an\nimportant one to make. Real world tensions can spill into the cyber realm, and vice versa.\nRemember the 2001 China-US tension? To refresh your memory, a US EP-3 aircraft collided\nwith the Chinese F-8 fighter jet and the Chinese pilot was killed. What followed was a\nsustained DDoS attack against US servers including defacement of the White House and\nmilitary from Chinese hacktivists. US hacktivists retaliated and it became a cyber graffiti war\nof sorts. What we found interesting is that it wasn’t until the Chinese called out this behaviour\nas ‘web terrorism’ that the attacks stopped.\n\n## China: No longer hiding its strength\n\nFormer leader Deng Xiaoping touted the mantra of ‘hide your strength and bide your time’\n_(韬光隐晦). Well, it seems that time has passed, and with Xi Jinping now at the helm, China_\nis certainly showing its strength on the world stage. China is no longer hiding from the world.\n\nChina has aggressively and consistently built its national cyber program, prioritising\neducation in computer science and technology and creating a recruitment pipeline of\ngraduates from within its universities. Its focus seemingly being on offensive capabilities\nrather than security or intelligence analysis.\n\nAs evidenced in our bottom-heavy timeline (seen above), the CCP have increased their\nscope for hacking and stealing. What is obvious to any observer is that they hack\nindiscriminately – friends and enemies are fair game. China’s BRI initiative is even\n[considered a driver of cyber activity, which this graphic from Security Affairs neatly highlights.](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/75448/apt/bri-cyber-espionage-china.html)\n\n\n-----\n\n_Tsinghua university IP traffic aligning with BRI initiatives_\nAnd their activity is at an industrial scale. This uptick reflects the CCP’s priorities targeting\nintellectual property (IP) that have coincided with China’s Five-Year Plans. It is now so\ncommon that barely a day goes by without another article reporting Chinese cyber theft.\nProvides us with lots of rich content though!\n\n## Disgruntled Hackers and ties to Academia\n\n[Back in 2013, a disgruntled hacker from the PLA (given the name Wang) wrote about his](https://www.latimes.com/world/la-xpm-2013-mar-12-la-fg-china-hacking-20130313-story.html)\ntime in the PLA hacking for his country. “My only mistake was that I sold myself out to the\ncountry for some minor benefits and put myself in this embarrassing situation,” he wrote on\nhis blog. Few incentives and minimal benefits can lead some to defect and leave. Who knew.\nWe wonder if conditions have changed in China since.\n\nWhat hasn’t changed however are the links between Chinese hackers and academia. Wang\nhimself co-authored two academic papers whilst at the PLA university. And interestingly, it\n[was this same year that Cyb3rSleuth outed Zhang Changhe. His 9-5 job was as an assistant](http://cyb3rsleuth.blogspot.com/search/label/Chinese%20Threats)\nprofessor at the PLA Engineering University. Cyb3rSleuth was one of the first public uses of\nOSINT to attribute Chinese cyber-attacks to named individuals within the Chinese system\n(having named 10 Chinese hackers in total). Kudos – an inspiration to our platform.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Cyb3rSleuth identifying Zhang Changhe from Chinese social media as a PLA hacker_\nFurther, it was a Tsinghua university (清华大学) IP (self-proclaimed state-owned\ntechnological institution) that engaged in network reconnaissance targeting a number of\ncountries actively working with China on their Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) – see image\nabove.\n\nThe PLA led the way with cyber hacking back in the 90’s and early 00’s. However, in 2015\nthere appeared to be a shift within the Chinese government, with the PLA transferring the\nbulk of cyber operations over to the MSS. After all, when the PLA hack – it’s very clear the\ndirection of activity is coming from within the Party itself. This transfer (at least in the mind of\n[the CCP) enabled plausible deniability following the public indictments of PLA unit 61398 a](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-charges-five-chinese-military-hackers-cyber-espionage-against-us-corporations-and-labor)\nyear earlier. After all, signing cyber agreements with a number for Western countries meant\nthe Chinese military needed to ‘hide their strength’ and fade into the shadows.\n\n## Enter the MSS\n\nAs dedicated readers will know by now, it is the MSS that we at Intrusion Truth have\nfocussed on for some time. And we do so given their continued support and engagement\nwith criminal hackers. The MSS get something out of this relationship: deniability on the\nworld stage (supposedly). But what do the criminal hackers get out of this? I’m sure some\nwould say ‘security’. After all, the relationship between citizen and the state is deliberately\nmurky. In recent years, there is evidence that China will not prosecute hackers within its\nborders unless they attack China. However, as indictments have shown, the Chinese state\ncannot, and do not, protect their own.\n\n\n-----\n\nChina is a vast surveillance state. They monitor everything and everyone. Thus, one could\nsay that their continued denial of Chinese APTs, or cries of rouge actors… is laughable.\nChinese APTs leave traces of their activity on the internet. Whether this is due to their\nnaivety, thinking the state will cover their activities, or their inability to understand that the\nGreat Firewall does not actually prevent others connecting to Chinese infrastructure and\nseeing their mistakes – only they know. Perhaps they have started believing their own\npropaganda: ‘We are world-leading, stealthy, and advanced threat actors’. Or perhaps they\nsimply do not care? What is evident though is their sloppiness, which is something we are\nmore than willing to highlight, evidence and make public.\n\n## State-sponsored theft\n\nChinese IP theft represents one of the largest transfers of wealth in human history. And their\n[targeting is indiscriminate – from innovation and R&D (rice and corn seeds,](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-seeds-idUSKCN0X80D6) software for wind\nturbines, [naval engineering and medical research), to personally identifiable information (PII)](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2019/03/apt40-examining-a-china-nexus-espionage-actor.html)\nand sensitive government documents. Ultimately, anything that provides China an edge is\nfair game. The methods China uses rely less on physically stealing data, and more on MSS\ncontract hackers being tasked to steal it from within China’s borders.\n\nThere is a distinction made between a hacker and a criminal. Some might say one man’s\nhacker is another’s freedom fighter. Yet there are ethical and moral boundaries which the\nChinese continue to violate. Utilising criminals to hack for the state’s bidding, and to do so to\nsteal IP from hard-working companies provides an unfair advantage to prop up Chinese\nbusinesses. They can’t be pioneering or forerunners in their own right and seem to have\nconcluded that they need to steal to gain a competitive advantage. And this is theft\ncondoned and actively encouraged by the Chinese state. A state which is rapidly emerging\ninto a global superpower. It is a powerful message to be sending the world.\n\n## Home-grown hēikè\n\nThe [Wooyun.org shutdown appears to be one of the first events which highlights the CCP’s](http://drops.wooyun.org/)\ndirection of travel to essentially hoard offensive cyber capabilities by restricting the\n[publication of 0-day vulnerabilities. In a statement on Sina, founder of Qihoo 360 Zhou](https://tech.sina.cn/i/gn/2017-09-12/detail-ifykusey8931658.d.html?vt=4)\n\n\n-----\n\nHongyi (周鸿祎) stated that it was only imaginary success when competing in overseas\ncompetitions. Rather, Chinese hackers and their knowledge should ‘stay within China’ so\nthey could recognize the true importance and “strategic value” of the software vulnerabilities.\nFollowing this, China restricted travel for Chinese hackers, instead inviting them to compete\nin the home-grown Tianfu competition. The very same event where the winning vulnerability\n[(Chaos) has been aggressively used to target Uyghurs.](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/05/06/1024621/china-apple-spy-uyghur-hacker-tianfu/)\n\n## The APT side hustle\n\nAn increasing number of reports highlight activity from Chinese APTs deploying ransomware\non their victims and hacking for-profit, using the same tactics, tools and occasionally time as\ntheir MSS campaigns to conduct this side business. This has included the repurposing of\nstate-sponsored malware in the gaming industry, stealing virtual currencies and selling\nmalicious apps.\n\n[A really interesting article on China’s Sina Games portal details an interview with a Chinese](http://games.sina.com.cn/y/n/2014-04-30/1005780840.shtml)\nhacker. He comments that online games are the most valuable part of the Chinese hacking\nindustry. His reasoning? That China’s internet’s security consciousness is weak. Granted this\narticle is old. But what is interesting is the openness to which a Chinese hacker talks of\nhacking Chinese netizens for profit. Yet it seems this focus might have changed over the\nyears, with China’s hackers now focusing outside of the Firewall.\n\nThe Chinese government is permitting cyber criminals to conduct this activity within its\nborders. We have evidenced direct involvement of criminal hackers with the MSS, whilst\nothers in the InfoSec community have proven clear Chinese state links to APT intrusion\nactivity.\n\nSo, is it tactical toleration on behalf of the MSS to allow these hackers to conduct cybercrime\noutside of its borders for self-profit? Do the MSS pay their hackers so poorly that they have\nto let them make money on the side to keep them sweet? Or have the MSS lost control of\nthe criminals it employs to do its dirty work?\n\nWe are also seeing greater sharing of tools, techniques and knowledge across Chinese APT\ngroups. This is most evident with Hafnium, where a large number of Chinese APT groups\n[were concurrently and recklessly using the MES vulnerability. Increased crossover in](https://www.wired.com/story/china-hacking-reckless-new-phase/)\nmalware and TTPs points to greater knowledge sharing and a higher level of organisation\nthan what China would have us believe.\n\n## Chain of command\n\nAs we know, Chinese APTs take direction from the Chinese state. This is a pattern starting\nwith front companies, leading back to MSS contract hackers and ultimately to local and\nregional MSS bureaus. It is becoming increasingly obvious that there is something more at\n\n\n-----\n\nplay here. A cyber campaign of sorts; coordinated, run and tasked by seniors within the\nMSS?\n\nWe have evidenced multiple Chinese APTs which have relationships with MSS officers and\nare behind global campaigns of cyber hacking. Yet China keeps denying responsibility, crying\nthat claims of their APT activity is ‘baseless with no evidence’… we would recommend our\nblog as some light reading in this regard.\n\n## So, who is leading the Chinese Cyber Programme?\n\nLet’s look upwards. Someone is leading the coordination of China’s cyber campaign. The\nmultiple APTs, appearing across various provinces within China, are all linked by the MSS\nbureaus sitting behind these groups. And there is one person in charge of the MSS.\n\nOne person giving the direction.\n\nOne person overseeing the Chinese cyber programme.\n\nThat person?\n\nChen Wenqing (陈文清).\n\n## Cyber karma\n\nBeijing come across as powerful within the offensive cyber space. After all, their state is\nactively, aggressively and successfully sponsoring malign cyber activity against fellow states,\nprivate companies, industry and individual people. Yet [Beijing also see themselves as](https://www.iiss.org/blogs/research-paper/2021/06/cyber-capabilities-national-power)\nvulnerable.\n\nThe Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) is the country’s internet regulator and official\nbody for enacting censorship. Recently, it stepped into the controversy around Didi (the ridehailing app), ordering it to undergo a cybersecurity review ahead of its IPO in New York. The\nCAC later released a security-review revision in which it said companies holding personal\ndata on at least one million users must apply for a cybersecurity review before any foreign\nlistings.\n\nAre China’s actions causing reactions? It’s almost as if the Chinese government know that\ntheir bulk collection of data on Chinese citizens is contentious. They lead the way in stealing\nPII from foreign governments and organisations – and the CAC know how powerful this data\ncan be. Did they read our article outing APT10 using Uber receipts and are understandably\nworried about the vast data personal data holdings Didi might reveal on some of their senior\nofficials?\n\n_Cyber karma – It is the guilty party that assumes everyone else is doing the same thing as_\n_them._\n\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThere has been 100 years of the CCP but only 38 years of the MSS. Yet there are a number\nof questions which remain unanswered (ie, we’d like more evidence to help answer, might\nwe say):\n\n1. Does Xi know what the MSS are doing in cyber space?\n2. Do the CCP understand how their actions undermine the positive narrative China\n\nwould like the world to believe?\n3. Does the benefit of the Chinese cyber programme outweigh the costs to the Chinese\n\nleadership?\n\n## Happy Birthday CCP\n\n生日快乐. As our present to you for reaching this auspicious milestone, we promise to stick\nwith you and keep a close eye on what the MSS cyber programme is up to. We will continue\nto pen more attribution pieces as long as you support your APTs and deny they are working\nfor you.\n\n**Psst. Chinese cyber hackers: If you are reading this, please do enjoy our fun quiz we put**\ntogether. We feel the flowchart neatly leads to the right outcome.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----",
