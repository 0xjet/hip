Moreover, the\nattack is expected to be more serious in the future.\n\nGlobeImposter can be seen as one of the most powerful ransomware in these years. It uses\na high-intensity algorithm for encryption. Once the files are encrypted, it is almost impossible\nto decrypt the documents. Then the hacker will send the payment method to the victim via\nemail, and the victim is charged from 1 to 10 bitcoins.\n\nUsers should be aware of the severity of GlobeImposter ransomware attack due to not only\nits high-intensity data encryption algorithm but also its large number of variants. There have\nbeen more than 20 varieties of the family’s variants since June.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe new variant discovered this time is with the extension NACRO. Although it is similar to\nthe previous variants, the power of the attack is still not to be underestimated. If the\ncomputer is infected, the victim will find they cannot open their files, and the format will be\ntampered with seriously. After that, the attack will leave the contact form to the victim as\nusual.\n\n**Qihoo 360’s Security Brain provides the latest techniques to protect our users**\nWe found that GlobeImposter has various attack techniques, which is spread through\ncracking weak passwords.\n\nPreviously, a number of servers in a Chinese children’s hospital were infected with the\nransomware. The hospital’s database files were encrypted, and its hospital information\nsystem could not be used normally. As a result, the patients of the hospital cannot pay\nmedical expenses and make the appointment with doctors.\n\nTo keep away from the ransomware attacks, prevention is always better than cure. Qihoo\n360’s Security Brain is an all-in-one intelligent security system that comprehensively utilizes\nnew technologies such as artificial intelligence, big data, cloud computing, IoT intelligent\nsensing, and blockchain to protect the country, national defense, critical infrastructure,\nsociety, and cities and personal network security. Among them, its situational awareness\nsystem can capture global malicious attacks or network anomalies in real time.\n\n**Reminder**\nWe would like to recommend our users that they should install 360 Total Security to fight\nagainst the ransomware attacks. 360 Total Security would comprehensively protect our users\nfrom multiple dimensions such as the weak password automatic check, remote login\nprotection, vulnerability intrusion prevention, and document protection.\n\n[Learn more about 360 Total Security](https://www.360totalsecurity.com/en/)\n\n\n-----",
