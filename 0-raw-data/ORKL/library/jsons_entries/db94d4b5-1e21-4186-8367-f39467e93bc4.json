exploit\n\n**[therecord.media/microsoft-patches-six-windows-zero-days-including-a-commercial-exploit/](https://therecord.media/microsoft-patches-six-windows-zero-days-including-a-commercial-exploit/)**\n\nJune 9, 2021\n\n**Microsoft has released today its monthly batch of security updates, known in the**\n**industry as Patch Tuesday.**\n\nThis month’s security patches fix [50 vulnerabilities, including six actively exploited Windows](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/blog/2021/6/8/the-june-2021-security-update-review)\nzero-days, representing the largest batch of actively exploited zero-days patched in one go in\nthe company’s recent history.\n\n[CVE-2021-33742 – Windows MSHTML Platform Remote Code Execution Vulnerability](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2021-33742)\n[CVE-2021-31955 – Windows Kernel Information Disclosure Vulnerability](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2021-31955)\n[CVE-2021-31956 – Windows NTFS Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2021-31956)\n[CVE-2021-31962 – Kerberos AppContainer Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2021-31962)\n[CVE-2021-31199 – Microsoft Enhanced Cryptographic Provider Elevation of Privilege](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2021-31199)\nVulnerability\n[CVE-2021-31201 – Microsoft Enhanced Cryptographic Provider Elevation of Privilege](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2021-31201)\nVulnerability\n\nDetails about how the six zero-days have been kept under wraps, as is usually the case with\nthese types of disclosures, primarily to give defenders more time to apply patches before\nother threat actors can learn how to exploit the bugs.\n\n\n-----\n\nHowever, some small details have leaked, from Google and Kaspersky, two of the\ncompanies that reported the ongoing attacks to Microsoft in the first place.\n\n## CVE-2021-33742: A commercial exploit\n\nThe most interesting of the six zero-days is CVE-2021-33742, a remote code execution\nvulnerability in the MSHTML component that is part of the Internet Explorer browser.\n\nIn a tweet on Tuesday, Shane Huntley, head of the Google Threat Analysis Group, said his\nteam discovered this vulnerability being abused in the wild and all signs pointed that the\nexploit appears to have been developed by a professional commercial exploit broker.\n\nWhile Huntley didn’t share technical details about the zero-day, which he promised his team\nwill share in 30 days, the Google TAG head said the exploit appears to have been used by a\nnation-state for a small number of attacks against targets in Eastern Europe and the Middle\nEast.\n\nMore details will be on CVE-2021-33742 will come from the team, but for context this\nseem to be a commercial exploit company providing capability for limited nation state\nEastern Europe / Middle East targeting.\n\n[— Shane Huntley (@ShaneHuntley) June 8, 2021](https://twitter.com/ShaneHuntley/status/1402320072123719690?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n## Two zero-days targeted recent versions of Windows 10\n\nBut while Google was able to link the MSHTML zero-day attacks to an exploit broker and a\nnation-state entity, Kaspersky is still looking for details about two zero-days its researchers\ncaught last month.\n\nTracked as CVE-2021-31955 and CVE-2021-31956, the Russian security firm said the two\nWindows bugs were part of a complex exploit chain that also involved a web delivery via the\nChrome browser.\n\n“While we were not able to retrieve the exploit used for remote code execution (RCE) in the\nChrome web browser, we were able to find and analyze an elevation of privilege (EoP)\nexploit that was used to escape the sandbox and obtain system privileges,” researchers said\nin a [report published today shortly after Microsoft released its Patch Tuesday updates.](https://securelist.com/puzzlemaker-chrome-zero-day-exploit-chain/102771/)\n\nBoth Windows zero-days, which exploited two distinct vulnerabilities in the Microsoft\nWindows OS kernel, were particularly interesting because they were fine-tuned to work\nagainst the latest and most prominent builds of Windows 10 (17763 – RS5, 18362 – 19H1,\n18363 – 19H2, 19041 – 20H1, 19042 – 20H2), suggesting that the threat actor was\ninterested in targeting modern and up-to-date devices.\n\n## Two 0-days linked to last month’s Adobe Reader zero-day\n\n\n-----\n\nAdditionally, Microsoft also patched two zero-days in CVE-2021-31199 and CVE-2021-31201\n[that were related to an Adobe Reader zero-day (CVE-2021-28550) that Adobe patched last](https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/acrobat/apsb21-29.html#)\nmonth in May.\n\nBoth zero-days impact one of Microsoft’s cryptographic libraries and even impact old\nversions of Windows, such as 7 and Server 2012.\n\nUnfortunately, neither the Adobe nor the Microsoft patch notes reveal any information about\nthe attacks.\n\nTags\n\n[Adobe
