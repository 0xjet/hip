REUTERS/Carlo\nAllegri/Illustration/File Photo\n\nWells Fargo complied. Over 10 days, Wells approved a total of at least 12 transfers of BDA\nfunds requested over the secure SWIFT system.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe SWIFT network - which allows banks to process billions of dollars in transfers each day is considered the backbone of international banking. In all, Wells Fargo transferred $12\nmillion of BDA’s money to accounts across the globe.\n\nBoth banks now believe those funds were stolen by unidentified hackers, according to\ndocuments in a BDA lawsuit filed against Wells Fargo in New York this year.\n\nBDA declined comment. Wells Fargo, which also initially declined comment on the lawsuit,\nsaid in a statement to Reuters on Friday that it “properly processed the wire instructions\nreceived via authenticated SWIFT messages” and was not responsible for BDA’s losses.\n\nBDA is suing Wells Fargo on the basis that the U.S. bank should have flagged the\ntransactions as suspicious.\n\nWells Fargo has countered that security lapses in BDA’s own operations caused the\nEcuadorean bank’s losses. Hackers had secured a BDA employee’s SWIFT logon\ncredentials, Wells Fargo said in a February court filing.\n\nSWIFT, an acronym for the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, is\nnot a party to the lawsuit.\n\nNeither bank reported the theft to SWIFT, which said it first learned about the cyber attack\nfrom a Reuters inquiry.\n\n“We were not aware,” SWIFT said in a statement responding to Reuters inquiries. “We need\nto be informed by customers of such frauds if they relate to our products and services, so\nthat we can inform and support the wider community. We have been in touch with the bank\nconcerned to get more information, and are reminding customers of their obligations to share\nsuch information with us.”\n\nSWIFT says it requires customer to notify SWIFT of problems that can affect the\n“confidentiality, integrity, or availability of SWIFT service.”\n\nSWIFT, however, has no rule specifically requiring client banks to report hacking thefts.\nBanks often do not report such attacks out of concern they make the institution appear\nvulnerable, former SWIFT employees and cyber security experts told Reuters.\n\nThe Ecuador case illuminates a central problem with preventing such fraudulent transfers:\nNeither SWIFT nor its client banks have a full picture of the frequency or the details of cyber\nthefts made through the network, according to more than dozen former SWIFT executives,\nusers and cyber security experts interviewed by Reuters.\n\nThe case - details of which have not been previously reported - raises new questions about\nthe oversight of the SWIFT network and its communications with member banks about cyber\nthefts and risks. The network has faced intense scrutiny since cyber thieves stole $81 million\n\n\n-----\n\nin February from a Bangladesh central bank account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New\nYork.\n\nIt’s unclear what SWIFT tells its member banks when it does find out about cyber thefts,\nwhich are typically first discovered by the bank that has been defrauded. SWIFT\nspokeswoman Natasha de Terán said that the organization “was transparent with its users”\nbut declined to elaborate. SWIFT declined to answer specific questions about its policies for\ndisclosing breaches.\n\nOn Friday, following the publication of this Reuters story, SWIFT urged all of its users to\nnotify the network of cyber attacks.\n\n“It is essential that you share critical security information related to SWIFT with us,” SWIFT\nsaid in a communication to users.\n\nReuters was unable to determine the number or frequency of cyber attacks involving the\nSWIFT system, or how often the banks report them to SWIFT officials.\n\nThe lack of disclosure may foster overconfidence in SWIFT network security by banks, which\nroutinely approve transfer requests made through the messaging network without additional\nverification, former SWIFT employees and cyber security experts said.\n\nThe criminals behind such heists are exploiting banks’ willingness to approve SWIFT\nrequests at face value, rather than making additional manual or automated checks, said\nJohn Doyle, who held a variety of senior roles at SWIFT between 1980 and 2005.\n\n“SWIFT doesn’t replace prudent banking practice” he said, noting that banks should verify\nthe authenticity of withdrawal or transfer requests, as they would for money transfers outside\nthe SWIFT system.\n\nSWIFT commits to checking the codes on messages sent into its system, to ensure the\nmessage has originated from a client’s terminal, and to send it to the intended recipient\nquickly and securely, former SWIFT executives and cyber security experts said. But once\ncyber-thieves obtain legitimate codes and credentials, they said, SWIFT has no way of\nknowing they are not the true account holders.\n\nThe Bank for International Settlements, a trade body for central banks, said in a November\nreport that increased information sharing on cyber attacks is crucial to helping financial\ninstitutions manage the risk.\n\n“The more they share the better,” said Leo Taddeo, chief security officer at Cryptzone and a\nformer special agent in charge with the FBI’s cyber crime division in New York.\n\n## SYSTEMIC RISK\n\n\n-----\n\nSWIFT, a cooperative owned and governed by representatives of the banks it serves, was\nfounded in 1973 and operates a secure messaging network that has been considered\nreliable for four decades. But recent attacks involving the Belgium-based cooperative have\nunderscored how the network’s central role in global finance also presents systemic risk.\n\nSWIFT is not regulated, but a group of ten central banks from developed nations, led by the\nNational Bank of Belgium, oversee the organization. Among its stated guidelines is a\nrequirement to provide clients with enough information to enable them “to manage\nadequately the risks related to their use of SWIFT.”\n\nHowever, some former SWIFT employees said that the cooperative struggles to keep banks\ninformed on risks of cyber fraud because of a lack of cooperation from the banks\nthemselves. SWIFT’s 25-member board of directors is filled with representatives of larger\nbanks.\n\n“The banks are not going to tell us too much,” said Doyle, the former SWIFT executive.\n“They wouldn’t like to destabilize confidence in their institution.”\n\nBanks also fear notifying SWIFT or law enforcement of security breaches because that could\nlead to regulatory investigations that highlight failures of risk management or compliance that\ncould embarrass top managers, said Hugh Cumberland, a former SWIFT marketing\nexecutive who is now a senior associate with cyber security firm Post-Quantum.\n\nCases of unauthorized money transfers rarely become public, in part because\ndisagreements are usually settled bilaterally or through arbitration, which is typically private,\nsaid Salvatore Scanio, a lawyer at Washington, D.C.-based Ludwig & Robinson. Scanio said\nhe consulted on a dispute involving millions of dollars of stolen funds and the sending of\nfraudulent SWIFT messages similar to the BDA attack. He declined to name the parties or\nprovide other details.\n\nTheoretically, SWIFT could require its customers, mainly banks, to inform it of any attacks given that no bank could risk the threat of exclusion from the network, said Lieven\nLambrecht, the head of human resources at SWIFT for a year-and-a-half through May 2015.\n\nBut such a rule would require the agreement of its board, which is mainly made up of senior\nexecutives from the back office divisions of the largest western banks, who would be unlikely\nto approve such a policy, Lambrecht said.\n\n## FIGHT OVER LIABILITY\n\nThis week, Vietnam’s Tien Phong Bank said its SWIFT account, too, was used in an\nattempted hack last year. That effort failed, but it is another sign that cyber-criminals are\nincreasingly targeting the messaging network.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the Ecuadorean case, Wells Fargo denies any liability for the fraudulent transfers from\nBDA accounts. Wells Fargo said in court records that it did not verify the authenticity of the\nBDA transfer requests because they came through SWIFT, which Wells called “among the\nmost widely used and secure” systems for money transfers.\n\nBDA is seeking recovery of the money, plus interest. Wells Fargo is attempting to have the\ncase thrown out.\n\nNew York-based Citibank also transferred $1.8 million in response to fraudulent requests\nmade through BDA’s SWIFT terminal, according to the BDA lawsuit against Wells Fargo.\n\nCitibank repaid the $1.8 million to BDA, according to a BDA court filing in April. Citibank\ndeclined to comment.\n\nFor its part, Wells Fargo refunded to BDA $958,700 out of the $1,486,230 it transferred to an\naccount in the name of a Jose Mariano Castillo at Wells Fargo in Los Angeles, according to\nthe lawsuit. Reuters could not locate Castillo or verify his existence.\n\n## ANATOMY OF A CYBER HEIST\n\nThe BDA-Wells Fargo case is unusual in that one bank took its correspondent bank to court,\nthus making the details public, said Scanio, the Washington attorney.\n\nBDA acknowledged in a January court filing that it took more than a week after the first\nfraudulent transfer request for BDA to discover the missing money.\n\nAfter obtaining a BDA employee’s SWIFT logon, the thieves then fished out previously\ncanceled or rejected payment requests that remained in BDA’s SWIFT outbox.\n\nThey then altered the amounts and destinations on the transfer requests and reissued them,\nboth banks said in filings.\n\nWhile Wells Fargo has claimed in court filings that failures of security at BDA are to blame for\nthe breach, BDA has alleged that Wells could easily have spotted and rejected the unusual\ntransfers. BDA noted that the payment requests were made outside of its normal business\nhours and involved unusually large amounts.\n\nThe BDA theft and others underscore the need for banks on both sides of such transactions\n– often for massive sums – to rely less on SWIFT for security and strengthen their own\nverification protocols, Cumberland said.\n\n“This image of the SWIFT network and the surrounding ecosystem being secure and\nimpenetrable has encouraged complacency,” he said.\n\nAdditional reporting by Jim Finkle in Boston and Alexandra Valencia in Quito; Editing by\nDavid Greising and Brian Thevenot\n\n\n-----\n\nOur Standards: [The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.](http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html)\n\nfor-phone-onlyfor-tablet-portrait-upfor-tablet-landscape-upfor-desktop-upfor-wide-desktop-up\n\n\n-----",
