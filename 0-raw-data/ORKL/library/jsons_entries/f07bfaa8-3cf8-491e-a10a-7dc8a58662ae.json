In this case, it was a group commonly referred to as\n“Nitro,” which was coined by Symantec in its 2011 [whitepaper.](http://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/the_nitro_attacks.pdf)\n\nAs we dug deeper, we found additional compromised legitimate websites and malware from\nthe same group back through March of this year. In most instances, the malware is one\ncommonly referred to as “Spindest,” though we also found “PCClient” and “Farfli” variants in\nuse by the group. We don’t have enough data to say for certain that all of the malware in this\nblog was delivered via compromised legitimate websites.\n\nHistorically, Nitro is known for targeted spear phishing campaigns and using Poison Ivy\nmalware, which was not seen in these attacks. Since at least 2013, Nitro appears to have\nsomewhat modified their malware and delivery methods to include Spindest and legitimate\n[compromised websites, as reported by Cyber Squared’s TCIRT. Our findings indicate they](http://www.threatconnect.com/news/threatconnect-enables-healthy-networking-biomed-life-sciences-industry/)\nare continuing to evolve with the addition of PCClient and Farfli variants. The Maltego\nscreenshot below shows the activity we describe in this blog.\n\nThese events impacted at least the following industries, across four waves:\n\n\n-----\n\nA US based IT Solutions provider;\nThe European office of a major, US based commercial vendor of space imagery and\ngeospatial content;\nA European leader in power technologies and automation for utilities and industry;\nA US based provider of medical and dental imaging systems and IT solutions.\n\nIn July, Nitro compromised a South Korean clothing and accessories manufacturer’s website\nto serve malware commonly referred to as “Spindest.” Of all the samples we’ve tied to this\nactivity so far noted in this blog, this is the only one configured to connect directly to an IP\naddress for Command and Control (C2). This IP address has been in use by this group for\nsome time, which is interesting since they have evolved other components of their kill chain\nover time to ensure malware delivery, but oddly not altered their C2 infrastructure. It is simple\nfor companies to block any outbound traffic to this IP, which would negate the effort Nitro put\ninto successfully delivering the malware.\n\n37 AV vendors within VirusTotal properly identify it, and the PE timestamp shows the day\nbefore we saw it. In addition, the following three samples were found roughly a week apart\nfrom each other, possibly indicating the timing of the waves of activity.\n\n**Table 1**\n\n**SHA256** 0a1103bc90725d4665b932f88e81d39eafa5823b0de3ab146e2d4548b7da79a0\n\n**MD5** 7915aabb2e66ff14841e4ef0fbff7486\n\n\n**File**\n**Name**\n\n\nupdate.exe\n\n\n**File Size** 106496\n\n\n**First**\n**Seen**\n\n\n2014-07-24 11:54:02\n\n\n**C2 IP** 223.25.233.248\n\nThe next sample we found is commonly known as PCClient, which is not malware previously\ntied to this group. We discovered this, and many of the following samples, through historic IP\nresolution overlap between the same domains alternately resolving to either the\n223.25.233.248 or 196.45.144.12. The second IP has also not been reported as tied to this\ngroup before. However, this shifting of IP resolutions back and forth indicates Nitro is in\ncontrol of these domains. It also makes is fairly easy for any Infosec team to reach the same\nconclusion we did, which again negates their use both of a previously unreported domain and\nIP for C2, as well as a new family of malware. 25 AV vendors within VirusTotal properly\nclassify this sample as malware. Its PE timestamp was 8 July, almost a week prior when we\nfirst saw it.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Table 2**\n\n**SHA256** 8aef92a986568ba31729269efa31a2488f35920d136ab41cb6fce55fd8e0b4b7\n\n**MD5** 7522baef20df95eeeeafdf4efe3aac3c\n\n**File Name** lsm.exe\n\n**File Size** 65536\n\n**First Seen** 2014-07-15 11:48:33\n\n**C2 URL** xenserver.ddns[.]net\n\n**Resolution** 196.45.144.12\n\nThe next sample was another Spindest variant and had the same timestamp as the\naforementioned PcClient sample. In addition, Nitro chose to use the same C2 for this\nsample, making it easy to both find and tie to the group. 41 AV vendors within VirusTotal\nproperly classify this sample as malware.\n\n**Table 3**\n\n**SHA256** 995bc16a5c2c212b57ba00c2376ac57c8032c7f2b1d521f995a5e1d49066d64d\n\n**MD5** 6527ba8baab0f86b0ffb6178247772c4\n\n**File Name** install_reader11_en_aaa_aih.exe\n\n**File Type** PE\n\n**File Size** 81920\n\n**First Seen** 2014-07-09 16:31:26\n\n**C2 URL** xenserver.ddns[.]net\n\n**Resolution** 196.45.144.12\n\nThe next wave of activity we found took place in mid-May. Both samples were Spindest\nvariants with the same PE timestamp of 15 May. While neither MD5s for C2 match, the\naforementioned link to a post by Cyber Squared’s TCIRT did document Nitro using Spindest\nvariants with the same file name starting late December last year. In that case they used the\nhistoric C2 IP we note in Table 1 in this blog. 34 AV vendors within VirusTotal properly classify\nthe first sample as malware, and 40 AV Vendors the second sample.\n\n**Table 4**\n\n\n-----\n\n**SHA256** e7f2af8c48f837da57000c068368d77bc9b06eba1e077edfab58df6aa2ea40ec\n\n**MD5** 271e6a4d45c2817f86148ca413f97604\n\n**File Name** mdm.exe\n\n**File Size** 118784\n\n**First Seen** 2014-05-20 08:43:15\n\n**C2 URL** zipoo.redirectme[.]net\n\n**Resolution** 196.45.144.12\n\n**Table 5**\n\n**SHA256** e601da16f923b33465dbafbff9d47195e8fc50099fd0581a16a1745bf890afb6\n\n**MD5** be765cd5723e4366d35172aaf13fad44\n\n**File Name** CitrixReceiverWeb.exe\n\n**File Size** 135168\n\n**First Seen** 2014-05-15 16:34:10\n\n**C2 URL** zipoo.redirectme[.]net\n\n**Resolution** 196.45.144.12\n\nThe malware dropped was configured to use good.myftp[.]org as the C2 URL, and the IP\nresolution was 223.25.233.248. Both of these are known Nitro Indicators of Compromise\n(IOCs). In this case, the malware was a Farfli variant, again not a malware previously tied to\nthis group. 39 AV vendors within VirusTotal properly identify the file as malware. The PE\ntimestamp on the file was 1 April, about two weeks before we saw the file. Continuing the\nactivity, we discovered the actors had compromised a legitimate website belonging to an\ninternational technology company that provides Software Configuration and Change\nManagement (SCCM) solutions in mid-May. (It is a well regarded company and partners with\nlarge companies such as Microsoft.)\n\n**Table 6**\n\n**SHA256** 184c083e839451c2ab0de7a89aa801dc0458e2bd1fe79e60f35c26d92a0dbf6a\n\n**MD5** ec519d709c0582346741fe0094208216\n\n**File Name** update.exe\n\n**File Size** 159744\n\n\n-----\n\n**First Seen** 2014-04-15 01:13:14\n\n**C2 URL** good.myftp[.]org\n\n**Resolution** 223.25.233.248\n\nThe final sample, from mid-March, was also hosted on a compromised legitimate website, this\ntime a small, US based IT company. The IP resolved by the C2 URL was changed two days\nafter we saw this file to overlap with good.myftp[.]org for a month before returning the below\nresolution. The filename matches that of the sample in Table 5, which had a very similar third\nlevel C2 domain and the same IP resolution. This is also a Spindest variant with a PE\ntimestamp of the same day we saw it. 39 AV vendors within VirusTotal properly identify the\nfile as malware.\n\n**Table 7**\n\n**SHA256** ffbddfb536e8e604c880ec977d06f804a500fc0396899bd2c195fb1f5b74207a\n\n**MD5** a3b2e34973691ad320b70248bd67fbd2\n\n**File Name** CitrixReceiverWeb.exe\n\n**File Size** 192512\n\n**First Seen** 2014-03-12 06:58:22\n\n**C2 URL** zip.redirectme[.]net\n\n**Resolution** 196.45.144.12\n\nAs this post and previous cited research show, APT groups such as Nitro will continue to\nevolve their techniques within the kill chain to avoid detection. However, they also\ndemonstrate the value of tracking these threats over time, as this allowed us to uncover and\nproperly attribute the new IOCs because Nitro was still re-using old C2 infrastructure with\ntheir new malware.\n\nFor Palo Alto Networks customers, all of these files were properly identified by WildFire as\nmalware and all of the C2 domains are labeled as threats in both Threat Prevention and URL\nFiltering systems.\n\n**Get updates from**\n**Palo Alto**\n**Networks!**\n\nSign up to receive the latest news, cyber threat intelligence and research from us\n\n\n-----\n\n[By submitting this form, you agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge our Privacy](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/legal-notices/terms-of-use)\nStatement.\n\n\n-----",
