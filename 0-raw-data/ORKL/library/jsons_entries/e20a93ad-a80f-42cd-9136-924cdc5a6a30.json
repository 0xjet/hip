As part of this attack, the threat actors encrypted devices on the network\nand stole unencrypted files.\n\nFrom the information shared with BleepingComputer by an anonymous source, the DarkSide\nransomware group claimed to have stolen 150GB of data during their attack.\n\nTo prove their claims, the ransomware gang created a private data leak page containing a\ndescription of the types of data that were stolen and screenshots of some of the files.\n\n**Private data leak page sent to Brenntag**\nDarkSide initially demanded a 133.65 Bitcoin ransom, valued at approximately $7.5 million at\nthe time. However, after negotiations, BleepingComputer was told that the ransom demand\nwas decreased to $4.4 million, which was paid two days ago.\n\nFrom the bitcoin address shared with BleepingComputer, we confirmed that Brenntag sent\nthe ransom to the attackers on May 11th.\n\nToday, Brenntag shared a statement with BleepingComputer confirming that they suffered a\nsecurity incident but did not outright state it was a ransomware attack.\n\n\"Brenntag North America is currently working to resolve a limited information security\nincident,\" Brenntag told BleepingComputer.\n\n\"As soon as we learned of this incident, we disconnected affected systems from the network\nto contain the threat.\"\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition, third-party cybersecurity and forensic experts were immediately engaged to help\ninvestigate. We also informed law enforcement of this incident.\"\n\n## Gained access through stolen credentials\n\nDarkSide is a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) operation, which is when the ransomware\ndevelopers partner with third-party affiliates, or hackers, who are responsible for gaining\naccess to a network and encrypting devices.\n\nAs part of this arrangement, the core DarkSide team earns 20-30% of a ransom payment,\nand the rest goes to the affiliate who conducted the attack.\n\nOne of the conditions for most ransomware negotiations is that the affiliate discloses how\nthey gained access to a victim's network. This could come in the form of a multi-page\nsecurity audit report or simply a simple paragraph in the Tor chat screen explaining how they\ngained access.\n\nIn this particular case, the DarkSide affiliate claims to have gotten access to the network after\npurchasing stolen credentials. However, the DarkSide affiliate does not know how the\ncredentials were originally obtained.\n\n\n-----\n\n**DarkSide says they purchase credentials for the network**\nRansomware gangs and other threat actors commonly use dark web marketplace to\npurchase stolen credentials, especially those for Remote Desktop credentials.\n\nLast month, BleepingComputer reported how one of the largest RDP marketplaces, UAS,\nsuffered a breach showing that over the past three years they had access to 1.3 million\nstolen credentials.\n\nWhile this was an expensive lesson, and unfortunately all-too-common, the attack illustrates\nthe importance of enforcing multi-factor authentication for all logins on a network and putting\nall Remote Desktop servers behind a VPN.\n\nIf MFA was enabled for account logins, it is unlikely that the DarkSide affiliate would have\ngained access to the network.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Costa Rica declares national emergency after Conti ransomware attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/costa-rica-declares-national-emergency-after-conti-ransomware-attacks/)\n\n[Ransom payment is roughly 15% of the total cost of ransomware attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransom-payment-is-roughly-15-percent-of-the-total-cost-of-ransomware-attacks/)\n\n[New Black Basta ransomware springs into action with a dozen breaches](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-black-basta-ransomware-springs-into-action-with-a-dozen-breaches/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[American Dental Association hit by new Black Basta ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/american-dental-association-hit-by-new-black-basta-ransomware/)\n\n[Wind turbine firm Nordex hit by Conti ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/wind-turbine-firm-nordex-hit-by-conti-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
