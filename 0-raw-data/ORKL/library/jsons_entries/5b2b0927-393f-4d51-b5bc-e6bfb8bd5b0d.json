While the group has gained attention recently, its activities go\n[back at least a decade with the widespread Havex campaign. Despite the group’s longevity](https://web.archive.org/web/20190508165233/http:/www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/Dragonfly_Threat_Against_Western_Energy_Suppliers.pdf)\nand consistent targeting of critical infrastructure, including the electric and oil and gas\nsectors, the group has not been the focus of much government disclosure. While linked by\nthe [US government and](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/TA18-074A) [other](https://www.securityweek.com/crowdstrike-takes-chinese-russian-attack-groups-threat-report) [entities to Russian interests, the group has not featured](https://www.cyberscoop.com/us-nuclear-hack-russia-energetic-bear-fireeye-phishing-watering-hole/)\nprominently in items such as indictments and sanctions.\n\nFor example, Russian military intelligence (GRU) has repeatedly been targeted by the US,\nUK, and other governments through disclosures and other actions in response to actions\nassociated with the organization. These actions have allowed us to gain incredible insight\ninto GRU operations, including in-depth observations into specific units such as GRU Unit\n[74455 (“Sandworm”) and](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0034/) [Unit 26165 (mostly associated with APT28 or](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-charges-russian-gru-officers-international-hacking-and-related-influence-and) [Fancy Bear](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/who-is-fancy-bear/)\noperations). Other government reporting, such as annual Estonian reporting which has\n\n\n-----\n\npreviously linked specific Russian intelligence agencies with commercially tracked threat\n[actors covers the GRU-linked entities as well as other actors such as APT29/Cozy Bear and](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0016/)\n[Turla, but does not at all address Energetic Bear activity.](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0010/)\n\nOne likely reason why Energetic activity has likely not received the same level of interest as\nGRU-linked entities is the nature and impact (or lack thereof) of operations. Specifically,\n[while GRU operations are linked to multiple disruptive events – the 2015 and](https://ics.sans.org/media/E-ISAC_SANS_Ukraine_DUC_5.pdf) [2016 Ukraine](https://www.dragos.com/wp-content/uploads/CRASHOVERRIDE.pdf)\n[power incidents, the 2016 US election interference activities, the](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/publications/JAR_16-20296A_GRIZZLY%20STEPPE-2016-1229.pdf) [2017 NotPetya incident,](https://www.cyberscoop.com/uk-government-blames-russian-military-infamous-notpetya-cyberattacks/)\namong other items – there are no known (deliberate) disruptions or incidents associated with\n[Energetic operations. This is understood and reflected in recent reporting and](https://www.wired.com/story/berserk-bear-russia-infrastructure-hacking/) past\n\n\n-----\n\n[observations on Energetic activity, and likely explains why the group has evaded public](https://pylos.co/2018/12/26/electric-sector-targeting-in-context/)\nsanction by government entities.\n\nAnother factor which has likely led to confusion around Energetic is the group’s evolution\nover time and lack of consistent naming. Since emerging around 2010, the group has\nreceived multiple names or references: Energetic Bear, [Berserk Bear,](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0074/) [Crouching Yeti,](https://usa.kaspersky.com/resource-center/threats/crouching-yeti-energetic-bear-malware-threat) Iron\nLiberty, [Dragonfly,](https://web.archive.org/web/20190508165233/http:/www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/Dragonfly_Threat_Against_Western_Energy_Suppliers.pdf) [Dragonfly2,](https://symantec-blogs.broadcom.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/dragonfly-energy-sector-cyber-attacks) [DYMALLOY,](https://www.dragos.com/threat/dymalloy/) [ALLANITE,](https://www.dragos.com/threat/allanite/) [Temp.Isotope,](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2019/09/ontology-understand-assess-operational-technology-cyber-incidents.html) [Palmetto Fusion, etc.](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/TA17-293A)\nAdditionally, items have either collapsed into each other (e.g., CrowdStrike combining\nEnergetic and Berserk Bear) or separated into distinct (if related) entities (e.g., Dragos\n\n\n-----\n\ntracking distinct DYMALLOY and ALLANITE entities). Overall this is due to the group s\nevolution over time, which has manifested in noticeably different behaviors, tools, and at\ntimes targets over the past decade.\n\nYet for all the confusion and lack of observed, intentional impact, Energetic (or whatever\nyou’d like to call them) has attained significant successes within the realm of critical\ninfrastructure intrusions. Among other items, Energetic has:\n\n1. Developed one of only a handful of industrial control system (ICS) specific malware\n\n[variants through ICS-aware](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-14-176-02A) [modules for](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/advisories/ICSA-14-178-01) [Havex.](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2014/07/havex-its-down-with-opc.html)\n[2. Successfully breached multiple electric utility environments from 2017 through the](https://www.wsj.com/articles/americas-electric-grid-has-a-vulnerable-back-doorand-russia-walked-through-it-11547137112)\n\n[present including control system access in isolated instances.](https://www.eenews.net/stories/1060091819)\n3. Deployed relatively sophisticated intrusion mechanisms, such as network device\n\nmanipulation for traffic shaping or capture to facilitate campaigns.\n\nGiven these observations, we are dealing with an adversary that is clearly among the “top\ntier” of threat actors, yet one that has hardly become a household name like Sandworm,\nTurla, or APT29. Potentially driving this discussion is confusion over just “who is\nEnergetic/Dragonfly/ALLANITE/etc.?”\n\nWhen exploring this topic, looking at primary source publications is most beneficial and least\nlikely to result in error. While some individuals in the private sector can make claims such as\n[“It is the FSB!” while presenting little or no corroborating evidence, a review of publicly](https://www.wired.com/story/berserk-bear-russia-infrastructure-hacking/)\navailable sources can at minimum allow us to glimpse what Energetic is not. First and\nforemost, given the plethora of indictments, disclosures, and named sanctions released by\nthe US, UK, and other governments since 2016, we can clearly say one thing: Energetic is\n_not the GRU. Given the catalog of events – including less-than-disruptive items – reviewed_\nby [US Department of Justice indictments and](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/six-russian-gru-officers-charged-connection-worldwide-deployment-destructive-malware-and) [UK government and](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-condemns-russias-gru-over-georgia-cyber-attacks) [NCSC reporting, we can](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/reckless-campaign-cyber-attacks-russian-military-intelligence-service-exposed)\nsupport the following claims:\n\n\n-----\n\n1. Energetic is not related to GRU Unit 74455, associated with the vast majority (if not all)\n\nRussian-linked critical infrastructure disruptive events.\n2. Energetic is most likely not related to GRU activity at all, given that the (concerning)\n\nactions of this group have never been recorded in other indictments, sanctions, or other\nitems which have mentioned other GRU entities (such as Unit 26165).\n\n[That puts us into Russia’s non-military intelligence agencies – the FSB and the](http://government.ru/en/department/113/) [SVR – as](http://government.ru/en/department/112/)\nmost-likely sponsors of Energetic activity. Here, matters become muddier. As seen in items\nsuch as Estonian intelligence reporting (which assesses links to both the FSB and SVR for\nentities such as APT29), relationships to threats for espionage- or access-focused groups\n(such as Energetic) becomes much more difficult. While GRU-linked operations in many\ncases result in noticeable effects (such as the power going off), these operations are\ndesigned to not attract attention (at least, not immediately) which makes their disposition\nsomewhat more difficult.\n\nYet diving into the civilian intelligence angle for Energetic’s origins yields some interesting\n[insights. As covered in greater detail](https://www.ecfr.eu/page/-/ECFR_169_-_INSIDE_RUSSIAS_INTELLIGENCE_SERVICES_(WEB_AND_PRINT)_2.pdf) [elsewhere, Russia’s intelligence services are hardly](https://themoscowproject.org/explainers/russias-three-intelligence-agencies-explained/)\ncooperative – yet overlap between the civilian intelligence agencies (FSB and SVR) is more\nlikely than any collaboration or coordination between these entities and military intelligence,\nthe GRU. Furthermore, while GRU-linked entities – from 74455 attacks to 26165 active\nmeasures – are linked to operations producing noticeable disruptions, FSB and SVR entities\ntypically focus on “classic” intelligence operations and access development with no intention\nto produce a discrete incident. This observation holds even for items such as the 2016 US\nelection interference campaign, where [GRU-linked entities were indicted given their](https://www.justice.gov/file/1080281/download)\nparticipation in linked active measures, while FSB/SVR-linked entities (APT29) were largely\nleft out as they did not appear to “use” their access to a disruptive effect.\n\nBased on known Energetic operations to date, which have focused on penetrating\nenvironments but no known or intended incidents of disruption, they appear to align with\nRussia’s non-military intelligence agencies (FSB or SVR). While this may seem like so much\ntrivia for defenders, in this case it has significance for those wishing to protect critical\ninfrastructure. Namely, while GRU-linked operations are often linked to direct, nearimmediate transition to disruptive operations, FSB/SVR operations are aligned with more\nclassic intelligence operations. This could include developing access and gaining knowledge\non environments for later weaponization, but such a shift should only be anticipated in\nextreme events, such as the march toward more traditional hostilities. As a result,\ndifferentiating between these campaigns (and their likely sponsors) is significant in that a\nGRU-linked intrusion requires immediate remediation given that actor’s history and\nreputation, while an entity aligned with FSB/SVR – although still deeply concerning – can\nlikely be dealt with in a more measured, deliberate manner given the separation between\nintrusion and future (potential) impacts.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn this case, the ability to perform some degree of threat actor attribution combined with an\nunderstanding of likely threat actor intentions (or mission) can be of use to defenders.\nLooking at Energetic specifically, the actor’s campaigns are concerning both for their scope\n(targeting critical infrastructure in multiple environments for over 10 years) and success\n(breaching control system environments and similar throughout periods of activity). Yet\nunderstanding this actor’s likely motivations and mission set – espionage and operational\npreparation of the environment in the event of possible future hostilities – allows us to\nproperly assess this group’s actions and the required immediacy of response. Unlike GRUlinked actions (such as Sandworm events), Energetic operations can likely be monitored and\nfollowed over time without the need for immediate remediation in order to gain greater\nunderstanding of the adversary, facilitating larger-scale response in the near future. While\nsuch a judgment might be perilous for other actors involved in critical infrastructure\nintrusions, the preponderance of evidence indicates that Energetic activities are not\noperations designed to deploy immediate disruptive effects – thus giving defenders time.\n\nPerhaps it is this observation which makes Energetic less “sexy” than an actor such as\nSandworm. Although engaged in penetrations in sensitive areas, Energetic has yet to\nproduce an impact. Conversely, an entity such as Sandworm has caused headline-grabbing\nincidents that have earned both media and government attention. Yet just because an\nEnergetic intrusion will not result in immediate disruption does not mean we can sleep on this\nadversary. Rather, such efforts show the methodical, meticulous nature of long-term cyber\nintrusions into critical infrastructure and related sectors to further national interests. While we\nmay lose sight of such activity amidst the latest ransomware or flashy disruptive incident,\ncampaigns such as those conducted by Energetic are those which will truly matter in the\nevent “cyberwar” ever breaks out, as these intrusions will enable the actions that will cause\ntruly catastrophic impacts.\n\n\n-----",
