During my tenure, I was able to see firsthand how ransomware was a\nmajor threat to national security—and we’re still seeing it today.\n\nRansomware is one of the top threats in cybersecurity. According to the Identity Theft Resource Center,\nthere were 878 cyberattacks in 2020, 18% of which were recorded as ransomware.[1] This threat is a focus\narea for Palo Alto Networks. Our Unit 42 global threat intelligence and incident response teams worked\ntogether to create the 2021 Unit 42 Ransomware Threat Report to provide the latest insights on the top\nransomware variants, ransomware payment trends, and security best practices so we can best understand\nand manage the threat.\n\nPut simply: ransomware is a lucrative business. The average ransom paid by organizations in the US,\nCanada, and Europe increased from US$115,123 in 2019 to $312,493 in 2020—a 171% year-over-year\nincrease. With new tactics like double extortion, this number will only continue to rise.\n\nOrganizations around the world are being held hostage by ransomware, and many are being forced to\npay cybercriminals because they’re not equipped to combat the threat for varying reasons, from a lack of\nrecoverable backups to the cost of downtime outweighing the cost of paying the ransom.\n\nWe need to significantly reduce this criminal enterprise, which is why I’m proud that Palo Alto Networks is\n[a member of ​the Institute for Security and Technology’s Ransomware Task Force (RTF)​, in which I serve as](https://securityandtechnology.org/ransomwaretaskforce/)\na co-chair.\n\nThe RTF is focused on developing a suite of recommendations for a comprehensive strategy to mitigate the\nransomware threat. To develop a set of solutions that will attack all sides of the ransomware scourge, the\nRTF has recruited a large and diverse set of experts who are currently investigating a broad array of avenues\nfor recommendations—acknowledging all of the good work that has already been done in this space.\n\nThis means exploring questions like:\n\n- What can we do to better prepare organizations for a ransomware attack?\n\n\n\n        - What can we do to better prepare organizations for a ransomware attack?\n\n        - How can organizations understand and best respond to a ransomware attack?\n\n        - What are the greatest barriers for ransomware security adoption?\n\n        - How can we make it more difficult for ransomware actors to carry out an attack?\n\n        - How can we make the outcome of a ransomware attack less destructive?\n\n        - How can we create solutions tailored to the many different victims of ransomware attacks?\n\nAs these discussions progress, the task force aims to provide clear and actionable recommendations for\nboth public and private sector decision-makers internationally in spring 2021.\n\nI believe resources like the 2021 Unit 42 Ransomware Threat Report will help us in this effort to learn\neverything we can about this threat, enabling us to work across the public and private sectors to\ncollaboratively reduce the ransomware problem to something more manageable than the significant\nthreat we face today.\n\nJohn Davis\nRetired US Army Major General\nVice President of Public Sector at Palo Alto Networks\n\n[1. “2020 Data Breach Report,” ITRC, January 28, 2021, https://notified.idtheftcenter.org/s/2020-data-breach-report.](https://notified.idtheftcenter.org/s/2020-data-breach-report)\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Executive Summary\n\nTo evaluate the current state of the ransomware threat landscape, the Unit 42 threat intelligence and\nincident response teams collaborated to analyze the ransomware threat landscape in 2020 using\ntheir global data.\n\nThis report details the top ransomware variants (with links to threat assessments for each\nvariant), average ransomware payments, ransomware predictions, and actionable next steps to\nimmediately reduce ransomware risk.\n\n\n###### Cybercriminals Are Making, and Demanding, More Money Than Ever\n\n_Note: The following data is from the US,_\n_Canada, and Europe._\n\nThe average ransom paid for organizations\nincreased from US$115,123 in 2019 to\n$312,493 in 2020, a 171% year-over-year\nincrease. Additionally, the highest ransom\npaid by an organization doubled from 2019\nto 2020, from $5 million to $10 million.\nMeanwhile, cybercriminals are getting\ngreedy. From 2015 to 2019, the highest\nransomware demand was $15 million. In\n2020, the highest ransomware demand\ngrew to $30 million.\n\nOf note, Maze ransom demands in 2020\naveraged $4.8 million, a significant increase\ncompared to the average of $847,344\nacross all ransomware families in 2020.\nCybercriminals know they can make money\nwith ransomware and are continuing to get\nbolder with their demands.\n\n\nRyuk ransomware stood out from the pack.\nIn October 2020, a joint cybersecurity\n[advisory was issued by the Cybersecurity and](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-302a)\nInfrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the\nFederal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the\nDepartment of Health and Human Services\n(HHS), warning healthcare organizations\nagainst Ryuk attacks.\n\n###### The Rise of Double Extortion\n\nA common ransomware attack consists of\nthe ransomware operator encrypting data\nand forcing the victim to pay a ransom to\nunlock it. In a case of double extortion,\nransomware operators encrypt and steal\ndata to further coerce a victim into paying a\nransom. If the victim doesn’t pay the ransom,\nthe ransomware operators then leak the\ndata on a leak site or dark web domain, with\nthe majority of leak sites hosted on the dark\nweb. These hosting locations are created and\nmanaged by the ransomware operators. At\nleast 16 different ransomware variants are\nnow threatening to expose data or utilizing\nleak sites, and more variants will likely\ncontinue this trend.\n\n\ncompared to the average of $847,344 data on a leak site or dark web domain, with\nacross all ransomware families in 2020. the majority of leak sites hosted on the dark\nCybercriminals know they can make money web. These hosting locations are created and\nwith ransomware and are continuing to get managed by the ransomware operators. At\nbolder with their demands. least 16 different ransomware variants are\n\nnow threatening to expose data or utilizing\n\n###### Healthcare Organizations in the leak sites, and more variants will likely Crosshairs continue this trend.\n\nThe world changed with COVID-19, and The ransomware family that leveraged\nransomware operators took advantage of this tactic the most was NetWalker. From\nthe pandemic to prey on organizations— January 2020 to January 2021, NetWalker\nparticularly the healthcare sector, which was leaked data from 113 victim organizations\nthe most targeted vertical for ransomware in globally, far surpassing other ransomware\n2020. Ransomware operators were brazen in families. RagnarLocker was second,\ntheir attacks in an attempt to make as much leaking data from 26 victims globally. It’s\nmoney as possible, knowing that healthcare worth noting that the US Department of\norganizations—which needed to continue [Justice announced in January 2021 it had](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/department-justice-launches-global-action-against-netwalker-ransomware)\noperating to treat COVID-19 patients and coordinated international law enforcement\nhelp save lives—couldn't afford to have their action to disrupt the NetWalker ransomware\nsystems locked out and would be more likely gang. The dark web domain managed by the\nto pay a ransom. NetWalker operators, which hosted leaked\n\ndata, is no longer accessible.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### 01\n\n###### 2020 Top Ransomware Observations\n\n COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nAdversaries take advantage of current events to lure victims into opening phishing emails, visiting\nfake websites, or downloading malicious files. Case in point: with the global impact of the COVID-19\npandemic, ransomware attackers heavily exploited it as a theme in ransomware attacks targeting\na variety of industries. While the healthcare sector was a top target throughout 2020 due to the\ncoronavirus, many industries suffered deeply from ransomware incidents.\n\nBattling with a more fragile financial outlook throughout the year as well as the added challenges of\nemployees working from home, many businesses have had to make do with less. With fewer staff and\nbudget cutbacks, cyberthreat awareness and cybersecurity protections may be more difficult to implement.\n\n###### Shifts in Approach\n\nRansomware has become increasingly easy to get hold of and is available in many formats targeting\nmultiple platforms. We’ve observed shifts from high-volume and spray-and-pray models to a more\nfocused “stay-and-play” model, where operators take their time to learn the victims and their networks,\nfollowing a more traditional network penetration approach.\n\n###### Platforms Targeted\n\nIn addition to ransomware being observed on Microsoft Windows[®], Apple macOS[®], and mobile operating\nsystems, we are now seeing Linux being targeted as well.\n\n###### Ease of Use and Availability\n\n\n###### Ease of Use and Availability\n\nAdversaries understand that ransomware, specifically the ransomware as a service (RaaS) subscription-\nbased model, is simple to execute, exceptionally effective, and potentially profitable—both from\ndirect payments and sale of valuable information. The RaaS model allows affiliates to utilize existing\nransomware software to carry out attacks, thereby earning a percentage of each successful ransom\npayment.\n\nRansomware operators continue to gain access to victim environments through traditional methods,\nincluding phishing, weak or compromised Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) credentials, and exploiting\napplication/software vulnerabilities. Despite 2020’s larger remote workforce, these entry techniques\nremained the same. Many operators are also combining commodity malware such as Dridex, Emotet,\nand Trickbot for initial access. Once inside a network, adversaries use native tools such as PSExec and\nPowerShell to enumerate the network and move laterally.\n\n###### The Rise of Double Extortion\n\nSeveral ransomware families—NetWalker, RagnarLocker, DoppelPaymer, and many others, as shown\nin figure 1—have displayed their ability to exfiltrate data and use double extortion techniques. Instead of\nonly encrypting files on the victim host(s), operators exfiltrate files first to further coerce the victim into\npaying the ransom. Exfiltrated files are then posted, or threatened to be published, on a public or dark web\nleak site, with the majority of leak sites hosted on the dark web. These hosting locations are created and\nmanaged by the ransomware operators. Some ransomware operators will further prove their knowledge of\na victim’s network environment by displaying the data in the form of directories or file trees.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1 gives a high-level overview of victims impacted by leak sites that were still live in January 2021.\nThis gives us an understanding of the enormous scale of the damage these ransomware operators are doing.\nMost notably, NetWalker ransomware leaks lead the list at a staggering 33%, and other groups account for\n[7% or lower each. It is also important to highlight that a coordinated international law enforcement action](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/department-justice-launches-global-action-against-netwalker-ransomware)\nwas conducted to disrupt the NetWalker ransomware gang on January 27, 2021. The dark web domain\nmanaged by the NetWalker operators is no longer accessible.\n\n\nNetWalker\n\nRagnarLocker\n\nDoppelPaymer\n\nNefilim\n\nDarkSide\n\nREvil\n\nAvaddon\n\nClop\n\nEverest\n\nSunCrypt\n\nMount Locker\n\nDefray777\n\nLockBit\n\nPay2Key\n\nBabuk\n\nRanzy\n\n\n114\n\n26\n\n25\n\n24\n\n24\n\n23\n\n23\n\n22\n\n17\n\n10\n\n10\n\n9\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n3\n\n**0** **20** **40** **60** **80** **100** **120**\n\n**Figure 1:** Number of victim organizations globally, by ransomware\n\nfamily, with data published on leak sites, Jan. 2020 – Jan. 2021\n\n\nWe also looked into the number of victim\norganizations with data published on leaked sites by **JAPAC**\n\n**9%**\n\nregion. As seen in figure 2, the Americas region was\nhit the hardest, followed by EMEA (Europe, the Middle\nEast, and Africa) and JAPAC (Japan and Asia-Pacific).\n\nOf the victim organizations with data published on **EMEA**\nleak sites, the top three countries impacted globally **29%**\nwere the United States (47% of organizations), Canada\n(12%), and Germany (8%). If these percentages are\n\n**Americas**\n\nparallel to how many organizations actually pay the **62%**\nransom, this could mean organizations in the US are\nmore profitable for ransomware operators to target\nthan others. Also, given the increasing acceptance\nof cyber insurance solutions in countries like the US,\nCanada, and Germany, many companies may decide\nto pay the ransom if they are already covered by their\nrespective insurance providers.

Published data from each organization ranged anywhere from 30 MB to more than 1000 GB.\n\n###### The Reintroduction of DDoS Campaigns\n\nSeveral ransomware families were identified using distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) against victim\nwebsites as additional leverage. For example, the Avaddon ransomware operators have begun employing\nDDoS attacks against victim organizations that do not cooperate with the actors during the negotiation\nperiod. This concept is not new. In 2016 and again in 2019, operators were emailing DDoS threats to\nransom victims if they did not pay. However, 2020 reintroduced this destructive strategy.\n\n###### Ransomware Incident Costs\n\nOrganizations of all sizes across many industries have been impacted by ransomware. Compared to\n2019, we observed an increase of ransomware incident response cases across several industries in the\nUS, Canada, and Europe, as displayed in figure 5. While this figure depicts a summary of overall industry\ntargeting, it is not representative of the known increase in incidents across sectors such as healthcare,\nmanufacturing, and education. Ransomware engagements throughout 2020 were more complex than in\nprior years, leading to longer, more in-depth breach response times.\n\nMost notably, the information technology sector saw a 65% increase in ransomware incident response\ncases from 2019 to 2020. As organizations shifted to remote workforces due to the COVID-19 pandemic,\nransomware operators adapted their tactics accordingly, including the use of malicious emails containing\npandemic-based subjects and even malicious mobile apps claiming to offer information about the virus.\n\n\n-----\n\n**2019** **2020**\n\n\n**80**\n\n76\n\n**60**\n\n52\n\n50\n\n45\n\n**40**\n\n34\n\n32 32\n\n29 28\n\n**20** 20 20 20\n\n16\n\n14 14 14 13 13\n\n11 10 10 11 12 12 9 9\n\n5 4 3 2 5 2 2\n\n**0** 0\n\n**[Figure 5: Ransomware incident response cases by industry](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/resources/datasheets/crypsis-corporate-overview)**\n\nin 2019 and 2020 in the US, Canada, and Europe\n\nAdditionally, ransomware actors are demanding more money year over year in the US, Canada, and\nEurope. In 2020, ransom demands were an average of US$847,344, often requested in the form of bitcoin\nor Monero cryptocurrency. This amount can vary dramatically depending on the ransomware family.\n\nThe total cost of a ransomware incident is also typically much more than the demand itself. In 2020, the\naverage cost of a forensic engagement (or incident response investigation) was US$73,851, even when\nbackups were considered a viable option for the organization. This number does not account for other\ncosts potentially accrued, monetary or otherwise, bringing the total average cost overall to a number that\nwould incapacitate many businesses.\n\n|Col1|76|\n|---|---|\n||52 50 45|\n||34 32 32 29 28 20 20 20|\n||16 14 14 14 13 13 11 10 10 11 12 12 9 9 5 4 3 2 5 2 2 0|\n\n|Table 1: Costs Associated with Ransomware Incidents in 2020 in the US, Canada, and Europe (US$)|Col2|Col3|\n|---|---|---|\n||2020 Data|Earlier Data (Where Available)|\n|Avg. ransom demand|$847,344|—|\n|Avg. ransom paid|$312,493|$115,123 (2019)|\n|Highest ransom demand|$30,000,000|$15,000,000 (2015–2019)|\n|Highest ransom paid|$10,000,000|$5,000,000 (2015–2019)|\n|Lowest ransom demand|$1,000|—|\n|Avg. cost of forensic engagement|$73,851|$62,981 (2019)|\n|Avg. cost of forensic engagement, small and midsize business|$40,719|—|\n|Avg. ransom demand, small and midsize business|$718,414|—|\n|Avg. cost of forensic engagement, large enterprise|$207,875|—|\n|Avg. ransom demand, large enterprise|$2,923,122|—|\n\n\nThe total cost of a ransomware incident is also typically much more than the demand itself.

We saw both old and new families wreaking havoc on industries\nglobally. Ransomware operators took advantage of widespread COVID-19 concerns by conducting\nphishing attacks containing pandemic-related themes and heavily targeted already overwhelmed\nindustries such as healthcare. While the following is not an all-inclusive list, Palo Alto Networks observed\nthese families during the 2020 calendar year.\n\n###### Ryuk\n\nSince August 2018, numerous industries, including government, healthcare, energy, and high tech, have been\ntargeted by Ryuk ransomware. Throughout 2020, we saw a significant increase in Ryuk ransomware attacks\ntargeting education, healthcare, and government/military organizations primarily within the US, but also in\nthe UK and Canada. A heavy focus was put on hospital systems, likely due to the necessity for uptime, as these\nsystems were overwhelmed with handling the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We observed initial Ryuk ransom\nrequests ranging from US$600,000 to $10 million across multiple industries. Most often, these payments\nwere communicated using a ProtonMail account and requested in the form of bitcoin.\n\nTo gain access to a target system, Ryuk has successfully compromised hosts through malicious macros in\nphishing documents, utilized commodity malware such as Trickbot, BazaLoader, and Emotet, and used\nexploit techniques that allow malicious software to evade endpoint security products. In some cases, Ryuk\nwas installed weeks or even months after backdoor malware, such as Trickbot, was observed on that victim’s\nhost. In at least one instance, it was deployed after business hours using backup service accounts. Once they\ngain access to a system, Ryuk operators will leverage RDP connections to deploy the Ryuk payload or move\nlaterally through the network. During active infection, Ryuk will close and encrypt all files, including their\nown malicious document that resulted in the initial download. A file named “RyukReadMe” is placed onto\nthe system, and tools such as PowerShell and Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) are used to\nenumerate the network while evading detection.

Using malicious Microsoft Word and](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/maze-ransomware-says-computer-type-determines-ransom-amount/)\nExcel phishing documents, Maze targeted organizations globally across many industries, exploiting\n[vulnerable external services using exploit kits such as Spelevo to gain access to victim environments.](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/threat-brief-maze-ransomware-activities/)\nIndustries impacted by Maze include finance, healthcare, transportation and logistics, high tech,\ntelecommunications, construction and engineering, media and communication, and many others in the\nUS, UK, Canada, France, and Switzerland.\n\nIn late 2020, Maze began delivering its ransomware payload from within a virtual machine (VM) as\na means to evade detection. This novel technique was first observed in RagnarLocker and allows the\nransomware to deploy itself as a VM on nearly every targeted device it infects. The Maze file-encrypting\npayload was delivered on a VirtualBox virtual disk image identified within a Windows MSI file. Also\nincluded in the MSI file was a VirtualBox hypervisor used to run the VM. In some cases, the operators\ndeployed the payload days after establishing persistence on the network. Maze also uses various tools,\nincluding Cobalt Strike, Mimikatz, PowerSploit, and ProcDump, during campaigns.\n\n\n-----\n\nBefore file encryption, Maze operators could exfiltrate files for further leverage to get their desired\nransom payment. These files, or threats to expose these files, were posted to a leak site. In 2020, Maze\nransom demands averaged US$4.8 million, a significant increase compared to the average ransom\ndemand of $847,344 across all ransomware families in 2020. Direct communication with the operators\nwas through a Tor website.\n\n[In November 2020, the Maze actors announced their retirement from the ransomware scene. However,](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/ransomware/2020/11/maze-ransomware-gang-announces-retirement/)\ntheir legacy appears to live on in the Egregor ransomware, which began to emerge just before this\nannouncement. These actions follow a similar pattern to that of the GandCrab ransomware group, which\nannounced retirement in May 2019, only to return under the REvil umbrella.\n\n[Visit the Unit 42 blog for more information on Egregor ransomware or Maze ransomware.](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/egregor-ransomware-courses-of-action/)\n\n###### Defray777\n\nDefray777, also known as RansomEXX and Target777, was first discovered in 2017. Run entirely in\nmemory, it is the first ransomware to have standalone executable files for both Windows and Linux,\nwhere the Windows version will encrypt all files and the Linux variant will only encrypt directories\nspecified via a command line argument. Toward the end of 2020 and into 2021, Defray777 operators\nbegan to display their ability to exfiltrate data. Data associated with victims of this ransomware began\n[appearing on the dark web. Defray777 is associated with the threat group PyXie and has targeted the](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/vatet-pyxie-defray777/)\nhealthcare, education, manufacturing, government, construction and engineering, and high tech sectors\nin the US, Canada, Australia, Japan, France, and Brazil.\n\nBetween February and October 2020, we observed Defray777 alongside commodity malware such as\nTrickbot and IcedID. Like many other ransomware families, Defray777 is delivered most commonly\nvia phishing emails containing malicious Microsoft documents or abusing software vulnerabilities.\nDefray777 is executed using Cobalt Strike after installation of backdoor malware, such as Vatet, and upon\nencryption renames files using a file extension such as .[unique ID][eight-digit hexadecimal number]\n[or containing 777 or .txd0t.

Since at least May 2020,\nWastedLocker has been actively used against numerous industry verticals—primarily those with a\n[perceived large number of assets, which ultimately results in larger ransom requests that could be US$10](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-spotlight/2020/07/threat-spotlight-wastedlocker-customized-ransomware/)\n[million or more. WastedLocker is associated with the threat group referred to as Evil Corp, the same](https://research.nccgroup.com/2020/06/23/wastedlocker-a-new-ransomware-variant-developed-by-the-evil-corp-group/)\ngroup responsible for Dridex and BitPaymer activities.\n\nBetween June and September 2020, Unit 42 observed WastedLocker targeting the information\ntechnology, legal, pharmaceutical, manufacturing, and transportation and logistics sectors in the US and\nUK. These operators have been extremely successful with their ransomware infections thanks to some\nof the malware features, including the ability to mask itself as a fake browser or other software update.\nWastedLocker was developed with defense evasion in mind, as it contains the ability to bypass behavior-\nbased malware detection capabilities in anti-malware security software and transparently encrypts\ncached documents in memory. The operators have also been observed using standard off-the-shelf\ntools (e.g., Cobalt Strike and PSExec) not only for initial access, but also for system enumeration, lateral\nmovement, and command and control (C2) communications.\n\n[Visit the Unit 42 blog for more information on WastedLocker ransomware.](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wastedlocker)\n\n\n-----\n\n###### GandCrab + REvil\n\nLaunched in January 2018, the GandCrab ransomware put a considerable dent in the pockets of many\n[organizations. Despite a retirement announcement in May 2019 and the arrest of a significant distributor](https://securityboulevard.com/2020/08/belarus-announces-arrest-of-gandcrab-ransomware-distributor/)\nin July 2020, as well as a publicly available decryptor for multiple versions of the ransomware, we\ncontinued to see GandCrab infection attempts at numerous organizations throughout 2020. In fact,\nthrough November 2020, GandCrab made up approximately 45% of observed ransomware variants\ncollected from Unit 42 telemetry.\n\nIn April 2019, REvil ransomware (also known as Sodinokibi) began to emerge, targeting the professional\nand legal services, manufacturing, media and communication, wholesale and retail, construction and\nengineering, and energy sectors in the US, Australia, Canada, Finland, and Hong Kong. This ransomware\nvariant, likely developed by the same creators as GandCrab, continued to follow the traditional\nransomware-as-a-service model with a preference for RDP vulnerabilities or phishing for initial access.\nOnce in a system, the malware will attempt to initiate DNS requests to multiple domains followed by a\nTLS 1.0 connection after DNS resolution.\n\nIn January 2020, the threat operators began to utilize double extortion methods, informing victims that\nthey would publicly expose stolen data if the ransom were not paid. Ransom demands were requested in\nbitcoin and Monero, ranging from US$18,000 to $1.3 million.\n\n[Visit the Unit 42 blog for more information on GandCrab and REvil ransomware.](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/ransomware-threat-assessments/7)\n\n###### NetWalker\n\nNetWalker (sometimes referred to as MailTo) is yet another ransomware variant that has exposed\ncompromised victim data on the dark web, leaking data from more than 100 organizations heading into\n2021. NetWalker has been actively deployed since August 2019, targeting the government, healthcare,\nmanufacturing, transportation and logistics, and energy sectors in the US, Canada, Saudi Arabia,\nFrance, Germany, Australia, New Zealand, Sweden, Pakistan, India, Thailand, UK, United Arab Emirates,\nColombia, and South Africa. Victim organizations found themselves with ransom demands ranging from\nUS$100,000 to $2 million in bitcoin.\n\n\nColombia, and South Africa. Victim organizations found themselves with ransom demands ranging from\nUS$100,000 to $2 million in bitcoin.\n\nNetWalker is PowerShell-based and executed directly in memory via reflective loading. It has been\ndelivered to organizations via phishing emails, weak RDP credentials, or exposed VPN and web\napplications, and often spread via Server Message Block (SMB) remote execution using PSExec.\n\n[In January 2021, Tor sites used to communicate with NetWalker victims were taken down through a](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/department-justice-launches-global-action-against-netwalker-ransomware)\ncoordinated effort with international law enforcement. NetWalker is a supporter of the ransomware affiliate\nmodel. While many of the infected victims were asked to communicate with the operators through Tor, in at\nleast one case, the victims received communication through standard email. The primary communication site\nmay have been taken down. However, the malware still exists, and so does the capability to stand up new ways\n[to engage with victims. NetWalker is associated with the threat group Circus Spider.](https://go.crowdstrike.com/rs/281-OBQ-266/images/ReportCSIT-20081e.pdf)\n\n[Visit the Unit 42 blog for more information on NetWalker ransomware.](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/ransomware-threat-assessments/2)\n\n###### DoppelPaymer\n\nAnother ransomware variant that emerged in 2019 and carried strong into 2020 is DoppelPaymer, a\nknown descendant of BitPaymer ransomware.\n\nFor its initial infection vector, DoppelPaymer has been observed using fake software updates. Once\ndownloaded and executed, the fake update will then download and execute second-stage malware\nsuch as Dridex onto an infected system. Off-the-shelf post-exploitation tools such as Cobalt Strike,\nPowerShell Empire, and Mimikatz have also been observed during DoppelPaymer infections, as has\nPSExec (specifically to facilitate lateral movement within compromised environments). Additionally, a\ntool called Process Hacker, which can be used to terminate security services and processes, has also been\nobserved in these incidents.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhere approaches to victimization are concerned, the DoppelPaymer operators have hopped onto the\n[double extortion trend. In February 2020, they launched a leak site, threatened to sell data on the dark](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/doppelpaymer-ransomware-launches-site-to-post-victims-data/)\n[web, and even created a Twitter account for general exposure. Additionally, according to the FBI, the](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/doppelpaymer-ransomware-sells-victims-data-on-darknet-if-not-paid/)\nDoppelPaymer operators have been known to call victims to pressure them into paying ransoms.\n\nIn terms of victims themselves, DoppelPaymer operators have targeted state and local governments in\naddition to industries including wholesale and retail, manufacturing, finance, insurance, transportation\nand logistics, high tech, hospitality, and real estate within the US, Canada, Mexico, South Africa, Belgium,\nItaly, Norway, and Germany. DoppelPaymer ransom demands for 2020 were relatively high, ranging\nfrom US$50,000 to $1.5 million, initially requested in bitcoin.

Available source code for malware such as Dharma could](https://www.zdnet.com/article/source-code-of-dharma-ransomware-pops-up-for-sale-on-hacking-forums/)\nmean more customization with other malware, resulting in more successful and damaging infections.\n\nDharma targeted the insurance, transportation and logistics, high tech, healthcare, and government\nsectors around the US, Italy, Japan, and India with a focus on small and medium-sized businesses. Ransom\ndemands vary tremendously, having been observed as low as US$1,000 and as high as $150,000, requested\nin bitcoin. These operators appear to prefer communicating with victims through standard email. Instead\nof using an anonymizer service such as Tor like many other ransomware families, Dharma uses various free\nemail services, such as Tutanota, Gmail, Foxmail, and ProtonMail.\n\n\n[Visit the Unit 42 blog for more information on Dharma ransomware.](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/ransomware-threat-assessments/6)\n\n###### Phobos\n\nAnother offender that came into the ransomware scene around December 2019 is Phobos ransomware.\n[It is a likely variant of Dharma ransomware that leverages phishing using malicious Word documents or](https://www.coveware.com/blog/phobos-ransomware-distributed-dharma-crew)\nURLs, and compromised or weak RDP credentials for system access.

Adversaries of all kinds are continually looking for organizations to\ntarget, and they know that ransomware is not only effective, but can also be low-effort, especially if\nusing the ransomware-as-a-service model. We expect more and more operators will follow this model\nfor all sums of money.\n\n\nfor all sums of money.\n\n###### Increase in Variants and Capabilities\n\nSome of the most prevalent ransomware families we observed throughout 2020 were less than a year old.\nNew and updated ransomware variants will continue to be developed and deployed for use as standalone\nmalware or alongside commodity malware. Additionally, with Linux being targeted more often, it is clear\nthat adversaries will continue to build out the capability to target all kinds of systems.\n\n###### More to Adopt Double Extortion\n\nProof of compromise and double extortion techniques were also less than a year old heading into 2020,\nbut they have now exploded in popularity. At least 16 different ransomware variants are now threatening\nto expose data or utilizing leak sites, and more variants will likely continue this trend. In this vein, the use\nof Tor and other anonymous services will also continue to grow. The use of anonymized services makes it\nmore difficult for security researchers and law enforcement to track activities and identify indicators that\ncan be used for network defense.\n\n###### Increasing Ransom Demands\n\nThe highest ransom demand has increased from US$500 to more than $30 million in just a few years\n(doubling from $15 million in 2019 to $30 million in 2020). As long as attackers keep getting paid, these\ndemands will continue to rise. Very few operators make ransom demands in forms other than virtual\ncurrency, generally favoring bitcoin, though Monero was also requested in several incidents we observed.\n\n###### Continued Use of What’s Familiar\n\nMuch of the success of these operators lies in their ability to evade detection. Adversaries will continue to\ninfiltrate networks using traditional phishing and weak credentials, alongside tools native to the targeted\nenvironments. This includes using post-exploitation frameworks such as Cobalt Strike, PowerShell\nEmpire, and PowerSploit.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### 03\n\n###### Conclusion and Recommendations\n\nDefending against ransomware attacks is similar to protecting against other malware. However, it\nrepresents a much higher risk to the organization.\n\n###### Initial Access\n\nInitial access is relatively consistent across all ransomware variants. Organizations should maintain user\nawareness and training for email security as well as consider ways to identify and remediate malicious\nemail as soon as it enters an employee’s mailbox. Organizations should also ensure they conduct proper\npatch management and review which services may be exposed to the internet. Remote desktop services\nshould be correctly configured and secured, using the principle of least privilege wherever possible, with\na policy in place to detect patterns associated with brute-force attacks.\n\n###### Backup and Recovery Process\n\nOrganizations should continue to back up their data and keep an appropriate recovery process in place.\nRansomware operators will target on-site backups for encryption, so organizations should ensure that all\nbackups are maintained securely offline. Recovery processes must be implemented and rehearsed with critical\nstakeholders to minimize downtime and cost to the organization in the event of a ransomware attack.\n\n###### Security Controls\n\nThe most effective forms of protection from ransomware are endpoint security, URL filtering or web\nprotection, advanced threat prevention (unknown threats/sandboxing), and anti-phishing solutions\ndeployed to all enterprise environments and devices. While these will not outright guarantee prevention,\nthey will drastically reduce the risk of infection from common variants and provide stopgap measures,\nallowing one technology to offer a line of enforcement when another may not be effective.\n\n\nthey will drastically reduce the risk of infection from common variants and provide stopgap measures,\nallowing one technology to offer a line of enforcement when another may not be effective.\n\n###### Palo Alto Networks Capabilities\n\nCloud-delivered security services bring the network effect of thousands of customers across various\nsecurity technologies to coordinate intelligence and provide consistent protection across all attack\n[vectors.
