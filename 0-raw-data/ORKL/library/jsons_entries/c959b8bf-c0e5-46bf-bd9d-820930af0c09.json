The October files, distributed to customers on Oct. 10, did not have a\nbackdoor embedded in them, however, in the way that subsequent malicious files that\nvictims downloaded in the spring of 2020 did, and these files went undetected until this\nmonth.\n\n“We’re thinking they wanted to test whether or not it was going to work and whether it would\nbe detected. So it was more or less a dry run,” a source familiar with the investigation told\nYahoo News. “They took their time. They decided to not go out with an actual backdoor right\naway. That signifies that they’re a little bit more disciplined and deliberate.”\n\nThe October files were discovered in the systems of several victims, but investigators have\nso far found no signs that the hackers engaged in any additional malicious activity on those\nsystems after the files landed on them.\n\nFive months later, the hackers added new malicious files to the SolarWinds software update\nservers that got distributed and installed on the networks of federal government agencies\nand other customers. These new files installed a backdoor on victim networks that allowed\nthe hackers to directly access them. Once inside an infected network, the attackers could\n\n\n-----\n\nhave used the SolarWinds software to learn about the structure of the network or alter the\nconfiguration of network systems. But they would also have been able to breach other\nsystems on the network or download new malicious files directly to those systems.\n\nThe specific number of infected victims remains unknown at this time, but some of the\nvictims breached with the spring 2020 files reportedly include: divisions within the U.S.\nTreasury and Commerce departments, the Department of Homeland Security, national labs\nworking for the Department of Energy, [and the National Nuclear Security Administration,](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/12/17/nuclear-agency-hacked-officials-inform-congress-447855)\nwhich oversees the national nuclear weapons stockpile. In the commercial sector, the\nsecurity firm FireEye was also breached by the hackers through SolarWinds software, and\nlate Tuesday [Microsoft acknowledged that it had found malicious SolarWinds files on its](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cyber-breach/microsoft-says-it-found-malicious-software-in-its-systems-idUSKBN28R2ZJ)\nnetwork as well. Not all SolarWinds customers downloaded the malicious updates.\n\nFireEye was the first to expose the espionage campaign, in a blog post on Dec. 8 after\ndiscovering the hackers in its network, though it did not mention that SolarWinds was the\norigin of the breach into its network. The company did not become aware of the SolarWinds\nconnection until after publishing its post, according to a source.\n\nThe Treasury Building in Washington, D.C. (Patrick Semansky/AP)\n\nThe new information about the 2019 files expands the previously reported timeline around\nthe intrusions and indicates that the hackers had already compromised SolarWinds’ software\nupdate system at least five months earlier than reported.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis tells us the actor had access to SolarWinds environment much earlier than this year.\nWe know at minimum they had access Oct. 10, 2019. But they would certainly have had to\nhave access longer than that,” says the source. “So that intrusion [into SolarWinds] has to\noriginate probably at least a couple of months before that — probably at least mid-2019 [if\nnot earlier].”\n\nThe files distributed to victims in October 2019 were signed with a legitimate SolarWinds\ncertificate to make them appear to be authentic code for the company’s Orion Platform\nsoftware, a tool used by system administrators to monitor and configure servers and other\ncomputer hardware on their network.\n\nSolarWinds would not answer questions about how long the attackers were in their network,\nbut a spokesperson directed Yahoo News to a list of frequently asked questions published\nFriday morning that addresses the 2019 files. It indicates that in October 2019, SolarWinds\ndistributed versions of its software that “contained test modifications to the code base ... it is\nthe first version in which we have seen activity from the attacker at this time.” The company\nnoted that subsequent software releases it made in 2019 “did not include either test\nmodifications contained” in that October 2019 version or the backdoor added to the spring\n2020 versions.\n\nThe company did not say, however, that these files had been found on victims’ machines.\n\nThe files that infected customers on Oct. 10 were compiled the same day customers got\ninfected with them, as were files released in the spring of 2020, infecting customers within\nhours — and in some cases minutes — after they were compiled.\n\nProgrammers first write code in a programming language before compiling it into a binary file\nthat computers can read.\n\n\n-----\n\nSolarWinds headquarters in Austin, Texas. (Sergio Flores/Reuters)\n\nIt’s not clear when each individual customer was infected by the backdoor when the files first\nbecame available for customers to download in the spring of 2020. Charles Carmakal, senior\nvice president and chief technology officer at Mandiant, FireEye’s incident response arm,\nwouldn’t say when his company was breached but did say the attackers were not in his\ncompany for the full eight months between when the malicious software updates first were\nmade available for customers to download from the SolarWinds server and the time that\nFireEye discovered the breach. He told Yahoo News that their investigation shows that other\nSolarWinds customers infected by the malware did not download and install the malicious\nupdate until months after it became available on the update server.\n\nThere has been some confusion about how FireEye discovered the hackers in its network. A\n[story published on Wednesday quoted sources on Capitol Hill who said the hackers had](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/12/16/russian-hackers-fireeye-cyberattack-447226)\nduped a FireEye employee into revealing their credentials for accessing the company’s\nnetwork.\n\nBut Carmakal told Yahoo News this is incorrect. The breach was discovered after the\nhackers enrolled a device into FireEye’s multifactor authentication system, which FireEye\nemployees use to remotely sign into the company’s VPN. The multifactor authentication\nsystem works similarly to how Gmail users access their accounts in a secure manner. It\ngenerates a unique code on the user’s phone that they enter, along with their username and\npassword, each time they access their account so that even if someone has their username\n\n\n-----\n\nand password, they cannot access the account without the unique code. That unique code\ngets generated only on the account holder’s mobile phone that they have tied to their\naccount.\n\nAttendees walk by the FireEye booth during the 2016 Black Hat cybersecurity conference in\nLas Vegas. (David Becker/Reuters)\n\nAfter the hackers registered their device with the FireEye network to obtain the unique codes\nthat would normally go only to that employee’s device, FireEye’s security system issued an\nautomatic alert to the employee and to the company’s security team that an unknown device\nwas registered to the company’s multifactor authentication system as if the device belonged\nto the employee.\n\n“They had to provide credentials to authenticate [their device] to the [multifactor\nauthentication system] in order to authenticate to the FireEye VPN,” Carmakal said. “It was\nthe process the attacker followed to enroll in the MFA solution which is what generated the\nalert. But at this point the attacker already had the employee’s username and password.”\n\nThe employee whose credentials were compromised told FireEye’s security team that the\ndevice didn’t belong to him, and in the course of investigating how the hackers may have\nobtained the employee’s credentials, they discovered the hackers had gained access to the\nnetwork through malicious SolarWinds software.\n\n\n-----\n\nCarmakal didn t say how the hackers obtained the credentials after that or how many\nemployee credentials they stole. But once inside a network, it’s common for skilled hackers\nto seek access to critical system files where employee account credentials are stored in\norder to use those credentials to gain deeper access into additional parts of the network.\n\n**_____**\n\n**Read more from Yahoo News:**\n\n[The 2020 election wasn’t ‘stolen.’ Here are all the facts that prove it.](https://news.yahoo.com/the-2020-election-wasnt-stolen-here-are-all-the-facts-that-prove-it-184623754.html)\n\n[Trump’s desperate gambit to stay in office alarms Europeans, who know about coups](https://www.yahoo.com/news/trumps-desperate-gambit-to-stay-in-office-alarms-europeans-who-know-about-coups-233538288.html)\n\n[In liberal San Francisco, white responses to George Floyd’s killing proved revealing](https://www.yahoo.com/news/in-liberal-san-francisco-white-responses-to-george-floyds-killing-proved-revealing-100024230.html)\n\n[What Biden’s Cabinet picks signal about his presidency](https://news.yahoo.com/what-bidens-cabinet-picks-signal-about-his-presidency-174845214.html)\n\nOur goal is to create a safe and engaging place for users to connect over interests and\npassions.
