As we are always looking for weaknesses, if you are a victim of this variant and\n[decide to pay the ransom, please send us the decryptor so we can take a look at it. You can](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/submit-malware.php?channel=168)\nalso discuss or receive support for Cryptomix ransomware infections in our dedicated\n[Cryptomix Help & Support Topic.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/t/611907/cryptomix-or-crypmix-ransomware-help-topic-revenge-cryptoshield-extensions/)\n\n### Changes in the WORK Cryptomix Ransomware Variant\n\nWhile the encryption methods stay the same in this variant, there have been some slight\ndifferences. The ransom note is still named _HELP_INSTRUCTION.TXT, but now uses\nthe worknow@keemail.me, worknow@protonmail.com,\n**worknow8@yandex.com, worknow9@yandex.com, and worknow@techie.com**\nemails for a victim to contact for payment information.\n\n\n-----\n\n**WORK CryptoMix Ransom Note**\n\nThe next noticeable change is the extension appended to encrypted files. With this version,\nwhen a file is encrypted by the ransomware, it will modify the filename and then append the\n.WORKextension to encrypted file's name. For example, a test file encrypted by this variant\nhas an encrypted file name of 0D0A516824060636C21EC8BC280FEA12.WORK.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Folder of Encrypted WORK Files**\n\nAs this is just a cursory analysis of this new variant, if anything else is discovered, we will be\nsure to update this article.\n\n## How to protect yourself from the WORK CryptoMix Ransomware\n\nIn order to protect yourself from ransomware, it is important that you use good computing\nhabits and security software. First and foremost, you should always have a reliable and tested\nbackup of your data that can be restored in the case of an emergency, such as a ransomware\nattack.\n\nYou should also have security software that incorporates behavioral detections to combat\nransomware and not just signature detections or heuristics. For example, Emsisoft Anti[Malware and Malwarebytes Anti-Malware both contain behavioral detection that can prevent](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/malwarebytes-anti-malware/)\nmany, if not most, ransomware infections from encrypting a computer.\n\nLast, but not least, make sure you practice the following security habits, which in many cases\nare the most important steps of all:\n\nBackup, Backup, Backup!\nDo not open attachments if you do not know who sent them.\nDo not open attachments until you confirm that the person actually sent you them,\n[Scan attachments with tools like VirusTotal.](https://www.virustotal.com/#/home/upload)\n\n\n-----\n\nMake sure all Windows updates are installed as soon as they come out! Also make sure\nyou update all programs, especially Java, Flash, and Adobe Reader. Older programs\ncontain security vulnerabilities that are commonly exploited by malware distributors.\nTherefore it is important to keep them updated.\nMake sure you use have some sort of security software installed that uses behavioral\ndetections or white list technology. White listing can be a pain to train, but if your\nwilling to stock with it, could have the biggest payoffs.\nUse hard passwords and never reuse the same password at multiple sites.\n\nFor a complete guide on ransomware protection, you visit our How to Protect and Harden a\nComputer against Ransomware article.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[New ‘Cheers’ Linux ransomware targets VMware ESXi servers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-cheers-linux-ransomware-targets-vmware-esxi-servers/)\n\n[SpiceJet airline passengers stranded after ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/spicejet-airline-passengers-stranded-after-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[US Senate: Govt’s ransomware fight hindered by limited reporting](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-senate-govt-s-ransomware-fight-hindered-by-limited-reporting/)\n\n[New RansomHouse group sets up extortion market, adds first victims](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-ransomhouse-group-sets-up-extortion-market-adds-first-victims/)\n\n[Ransomware attack exposes data of 500,000 Chicago students](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-attack-exposes-data-of-500-000-chicago-students/)\n\n## IOCs\n\n### File Hashes:\n```\nSHA256: 69fa88c5b353f55edbb7187c090bee377e54900e1c78c580d7b3b3084c9d7d0b\n\n Filenames associated with the WORK Cryptomix Variant:\n_HELP_INSTRUCTION.TXT\nC:\\ProgramData\\[random].exe\n\n WORK Ransom Note Text:\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\nAttention!
