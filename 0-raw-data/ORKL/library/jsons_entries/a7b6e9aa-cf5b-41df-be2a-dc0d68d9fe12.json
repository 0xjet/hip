The NCSC,\nCISA, and the FBI have previously attributed the Sandworm actor to the Russian General\nStaff Main Intelligence Directorate’s Russian (GRU’s) Main Centre for Special Technologies\n(GTsST). The malicious cyber activity below has previously been attributed to Sandworm:\n\nCyclops Blink appears to be a replacement framework for the VPNFilter malware exposed in\n2018, and which exploited network devices, primarily small office/home office (SOHO)\nrouters and network attached storage (NAS) devices.\n\nThis advisory summarizes the VPNFilter malware it replaces, and provides more detail on\nCyclops Blink, as well as the associated tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) used by\n[Sandworm. An NCSC malware analysis report on Cyclops Blink is also available.](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/files/Cyclops-Blink-Malware-Analysis-Report.pdf)\n\nIt also provides mitigation measures to help organizations defend against malware.\n\n[Click here for a PDF version of this report.](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/AA22-054A%20New%20Sandworm%20Malware%20Cyclops%20Blink%20Replaces%20VPN%20Filter.pdf)\n\n## Technical Details\n\n**VPNFilter**\n\n**_The malware was first exposed in 2018_**\n\n[A series of articles published by Cisco Talos in 2018 describes VPNFilter and its modules in](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/05/VPNFilter.html)\ndetail. VPNFilter was deployed in stages, with most functionality in the third-stage modules.\nThese modules enabled traffic manipulation, destruction of the infected host device, and\nlikely enabled downstream devices to be exploited. They also allowed monitoring of Modbus\nSCADA protocols, which appears to be an ongoing requirement for Sandworm, as also seen\nin their previous attacks against ICS networks.\n\n\n-----\n\nVPNFilter targeting was widespread and appeared indiscriminate, with some exceptions:\nCisco Talos reported an increase of victims in Ukraine in May 2018. Sandworm also\ndeployed VPNFilter against targets in the Republic of Korea before the 2018 Winter\nOlympics.\n\nIn May 2018, Cisco Talos published the blog that exposed VPNFilter and the U.S.\nDepartment of Justice [linked the activity to Sandworm and announced efforts to disrupt the](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-actions-disrupt-advanced-persistent-threat-28-botnet-infected)\nbotnet.\n\n**_Activity since its exposure_**\n\n[A Trendmicro blog in January 2021 detailed residual VPNFilter infections and provided data](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_gb/research/21/a/vpnfilter-two-years-later-routers-still-compromised-.html)\nwhich showed that although there had been a reduction in requests to a known C2 domain,\nthere was still more than a third of the original number of first-stage infections.\n\nSandworm has since shown limited interest in existing VPNFilter footholds, instead preferring\nto retool.\n\n**Cyclops Blink**\n\n**_Active since 2019_**\n\nThe NCSC, CISA, the FBI, and NSA, along with industry partners, have now identified a\n[large-scale modular malware framework (T1129) which is targeting network devices. The](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1129/)\nnew malware is referred to here as Cyclops Blink and has been deployed since at least\nJune 2019, fourteen months after VPNFilter was disrupted. In common with VPNFilter,\nCyclops Blink deployment also appears indiscriminate and widespread.\n\nThe actor has so far primarily deployed Cyclops Blink to WatchGuard devices, but it is likely\nthat Sandworm would be capable of compiling the malware for other architectures and\nfirmware.\n\n**_Note: Note that only WatchGuard devices that were reconfigured from the manufacturer_**\n_default settings to open remote management interfaces to external access could be infected_\n\n**_Malware overview_**\n\nThe malware itself is sophisticated and modular with basic core functionality to beacon\n[(T1132.002) device information back to a server and enable files to be downloaded and](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1132/002/)\nexecuted. There is also functionality to add new modules while the malware is running, which\nallows Sandworm to implement additional capability as required.\n\n[The NCSC has published a malware analysis report on Cyclops Blink which provides more](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/files/Cyclops-Blink-Malware-Analysis-Report.pdf)\ndetail about the malware.\n\n**_Post exploitation_**\n\n\n-----\n\nPost exploitation, Cyclops Blink is generally deployed as part of a firmware update\n[(T1542.001). This achieves persistence when the device is rebooted and makes remediation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1542/001/)\nharder.\n\nVictim devices are organized into clusters and each deployment of Cyclops Blink has a list of\n[command and control (C2) IP addresses and ports that it uses (T1008). All the known C2 IP](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1008/)\naddresses to date have been used by compromised WatchGuard firewall devices.\nCommunications between Cyclops Blink clients and servers are protected under Transport\n[Layer Security (TLS) (T1071.001), using individually generated keys and certificates.](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1071/001/)\nSandworm manages Cyclops Blink by connecting to the C2 layer through the Tor network.\n\n## Mitigations\n\nCyclops Blink persists on reboot and throughout the legitimate firmware update process.\nAffected organizations should therefore take steps to remove the malware.\n\nWatchGuard has worked closely with the FBI, CISA, NSA and the NCSC, and has provided\ntooling and guidance to enable detection and removal of Cyclops Blink on WatchGuard\ndevices through a non-standard upgrade process. Device owners should follow each step in\nthese instructions to ensure that devices are patched to the latest version and that any\ninfection is removed.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe tooling and guidance from WatchGuard can be found\nat: [https://detection.watchguard.com/.](https://detection.watchguard.com/)\n\nIn addition:\n\nIf your device is identified as infected with Cyclops Blink, you should assume that any\npasswords present on the device have been compromised and replace them (see\n[NCSC password guidance for organizations.](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/passwords)\nYou should ensure that the management interface of network devices is not exposed to\nthe internet.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n[Please refer to the accompanying Cyclops Blink malware analysis report for indicators of](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/files/Cyclops-Blink-Malware-Analysis-Report.pdf)\ncompromise which may help detect this activity.\n\n## MITRE ATT&CK®\n\n[This advisory has been compiled with respect to the MITRE ATT&CK® framework, a globally](https://attack.mitre.org/)\naccessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world\nobservations.\n\n**Tactic** **Technique** **Procedure**\n\n\nInitial\nAccess\n\n\nT1133 External Remote Services\n\n**The actors most likely deploy**\n**modified device firmware**\nimages by exploiting an externally\navailable service\n\n\nExecution T1059.004 Command and Scripting\nInterpreter: Unix Shell\n\nCyclops Blink executes\ndownloaded files using the Linux\nAPI\n\nPersistence T1542.001 Pre-OS Boot: System Firmware\n\nCyclops Blink is deployed within a\nmodified device firmware image\n\n\n-----\n\nT1037.004 Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts: RC\nScripts\n\nCyclops Blink is executed on device\nstartup, using a modified RC script\n\n\nDefense\nEvasion\n\n\nT1562.004 Impair Defenses: Disable or\nModify System Firewall\n\nCyclops Blink modifies the Linux\nsystem firewall to enable C2\ncommunication\n\nT1036.005 Masquerading: Match Legitimate\nName or Location\n\nCyclops Blink masquerades as a\nLinux kernel thread process\n\n\nDiscovery T1082 System Information Discovery\n\nCyclops Blink regularly queries\ndevice information\n\n\nCommand\nand Control\n\n\nT1090 Proxy\n\n\nT1132.002 Data Encoding: Non-Standard\nEncoding\n\nCyclops Blink command messages use\na custom binary scheme to encode\ndata\n\nT1008 Fallback Channels\n\nCyclops Blink randomly selects a C2\nserver from contained lists of IPv4\naddresses and port numbers\n\nT1071.001 Application Layer Protocol: Web\nProtocols\n\nCyclops Blink can download files via\nHTTP or HTTPS\n\n\n-----\n\nT1573.002 Encrypted Channel: Asymmetric\nCryptography\n\nCyclops Blink C2 messages are\nindividually encrypted using AES-256CBC and sent underneath TLS\n\nT1571 Non-Standard Port\n\nThe list of port numbers used by\nCyclops Blink includes non-standard\nports not typically associated with\nHTTP or HTTPS traffic\n\nExfiltration T1041 Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\n\nCyclops Blink can upload files to a\nC2 server\n\nA Cyclops Blink infection does not mean that an organization is the primary target, but it may\nbe selected to be, or its machines could be used to conduct attacks.\n\nOrganizations are advised to follow the mitigation advice in this advisory to defend against\nthis activity, and to refer to indicators of compromise (not exhaustive) in the Cyclops Blink\nmalware analysis report to detect possible activity on networks.\n\nUK organizations affected by the activity outlined in should report any suspected\n[compromises to the NCSC at https://report.ncsc.gov.uk/.](https://report.ncsc.gov.uk/)\n\n## Further Guidance\n\nA variety of mitigations will be of use in defending against the malware featured in this\nadvisory:\n\n**Do not expose management interfaces of network devices to the internet: the**\nmanagement interface is a significant attack surface, so not exposing them reduces the\nrisk.
