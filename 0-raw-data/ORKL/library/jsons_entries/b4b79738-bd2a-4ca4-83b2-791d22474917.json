    "plain_text": "# Warning about “HermeticWiper Malware” by Russian APT Groups\n\n**dgc.org/en/hermeticwiper-malware/**\n\nFebruary 25, 2022\n\nIn Light of the currently ongoing War between Russia and Ukraine, Multiple Russia-linked\nAPT groups have used a new Data Wiping Malware dubbed HermeticWiper by the IT\nSecurity Community. References to IOCs are made with {} annotations. A corresponding list\n[of known indicators can be found in our IOC list.](https://dgc.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Hermetic_Wiper_IOC.xlsx)\n\n## HermeticWiper – Attack Chain Number 1\n\nThe Attack chain starts with the victim receiving a malicious archive file via email (mostly .rar\narchives but .zip and .7zip archives have been spotted as well). The archive contains a\ndocument file that is themed after the currently ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine,\nhowever this theme can change in the future. The document contains macro code that drops\nand executes a VBScript when the victim is opening the document, the VBScript has been\nidentified as a malware called GammaLoad.\n\nThis script starts by collecting information about the users and the system on which it is\nexecuted and prepares them for exfiltration to a C2-server. Then the IP address of the C2domain {T13} is obtained, which the attacker has configured via a WMI script {T01}. Then the\npayload {T15.x} for the next step is downloaded and the data that has been collected is\nbeing uploaded to the configured C2-server. This connection can be identified via a specific\nUserAgent-string {T02} that is hardcoded in the malware.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe payload contains some sort of remote desktop application, most observed so far is\nUltraVNC (see {T03.x} for other possible options). This allows an attacker to execute various\ntasks on the affected system including wiping data and destruction of the system.\n\n_Figure 1: Visualization of the 1st attack chain (Source: [3])_\n\n## HermeticWiper – Attack Chain Number 2\n\nA second attack chain has been identified, where the victim also receives a malicious email\nwith a malicious archive attached. This archive can be rar, zip or 7zip files, just like before.\nHowever, this time the archive contains a malicious Windows shortcut file (.lnk) that contains\na malicious link to download an MSI script {T17x}. This is executed after downloading and\nlaunches an NSIS installer that, in addition to decoy files (images and documents have been\nobserved so far), also creates a malicious DLL {T12.x} that communicates with a C2-server\n{T16.x} and deletes data from the victim system. This DLL disguises itself as a fake driver\n{T06 ->T09}.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2: Visualization of the 2nd attack chain (Source: [3])_\n\n### References and links\n\n[1] [https://twitter.com/ESETresearch/status/1496581903205511181](https://twitter.com/ESETresearch/status/1496581903205511181)\n\n[[2] https://twitter.com/threatintel/status/1496578746014437376](https://twitter.com/threatintel/status/1496578746014437376)\n\n[3] https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/hermetic-wiper-resurgence-targetedattacks-ukraine\n\nButton\n\n\n-----",
