This campaign infected victims with\n_Sakula malware variants that were signed with stolen certificates. Investigation into this_\nactivity led to associations with the adversary known to CrowdStrike as DEEP PANDA.\n\nOn 31 July 2014, an executable was identified, which, at the time, was not detected by any\nanti-virus products. When this file was executed, it caused the victim to view a website by\nusing the ShellExecute() API to open a URL. The site’s domain name was meant to spoof\nthat of a site set up to provide information on an alumni event for a U.S university. This\npage requested that the visitor download an Adobe-related plugin in order to view the\ncontent. The downloaded plugin file included a variant of Sakula malware. [1]\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Sakula malware in this campaign utilized the Dynamic Link Library (DLL) side-loading\ntechnique most commonly associated with PlugX activity. In the aforementioned universityrelated incidents, a legitimate executable named MediaSoft.exe (MD5 hash:\nd00b3169f45e74bb22a1cd684341b14a) loaded a file named msi.dll (MD5 hash:\nae6f33f6cdc25dc4bda24b2bccff79fe), which, in turn, was used to load the Sakula\nexecutable (MD5 hash: 0c2674c3a97c53082187d930efb645c2). This final executable was\nalso signed with a certificate assigned to an organization called DTOPTOOLZ Co., Ltd.\n\nCommand-and-Control (C2) communications in this incident went directly to IP address\n180.210.206.246; a sample GET request is below:\n\nFurther investigation revealed similar activity stretching back to at least April 2014, when\nsimilar TTPs were used to target a healthcare organization and a U.S.-based IT company\nwith high-profile clients in the defense sector. Two other incidents were also identified in\nAugust 2014 targeting a company in the DIB and a Mongolian government entity.\n\nAll incidents in this campaign were similar in that they utilized malicious droppers\nmasquerading as installers for legitimate software applications like Adobe Reader, Juniper\nVPN, and Microsoft ActiveX Control. They display progress bars that make it appear as if\nthe specified software is being updated or installed.\n\n\n-----\n\nExample of Installer Progress Bar Displayed by Dropper\n\nIn addition, the droppers all directed victims to login pages for services specific to the target\norganization like webmail, document sharing, or corporate VPN. In all cases except one, the\nvictims were directed to legitimate login pages. The one exception was a case in which\nvictims were sent to a login page hosted on a domain that spoofed that of the legitimate\none. It is unclear whether redirecting victims to these login pages was part of credentialcollection activity or merely meant to deceive victims into believing that the activity was\nlegitimate.\n\n\n-----\n\nExample of a Login Page that Victims were Redirected to\n\nThe campaign appeared to be over by the end of August, but a file was recently discovered\nthat suggests it may be ongoing. The intended target again appeared to be a Mongolian\ngovernment entity, and the file masqueraded as an installer for Microsoft ActiveX software.\nIt dropped the side-loaded Sakula malware just like in the other incidents; however, in this\ninstance, the Sakula payload was signed with a certificate assigned to a different\norganization, Career Credit Co., Ltd. The malware used the domain www[.]xha-mster[.]com\nfor C2 which was created in mid-September and is registered with the email address\nwendellom@yahoo.com and registrant name “tonyy starke” (hence the name, Ironmanrelated title for this blog).\n\nBelow is a chart showing the relevant relationships to this DEEP PANDA campaign.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe bottom of the chart shows an infrastructure connection between an IP address\n(198.200.45.112) used this campaign and also used in recently observed DEEP PANDA\nactivity.\n\n**Association with Recent Scanbox Activity**\n\nIn September 2014, CrowdStrike Intelligence identified a malicious file signed with the\nDTOPTOOLZ Co., Ltd. certificate. Analysis of this file revealed it to be Derusbi malware (a\nfavorite RAT of DEEP PANDA) that used the domain vpn[.]foundationssl[.]com for its C2. At\nthe time of discovery, CrowdStrike did not attribute the file to DEEP PANDA based on the\nmalware alone, but the use of the DTOPTOOLZ certificate to sign a malware variant known\nto be heavily used by this adversary makes it likely that this signed Derusbi sample is also\nattributable to DEEP PANDA.\n\n[In a recent public report from PWC, another foundationssl[.]com domain was linked to](http://pwc.blogs.com/cyber_security_updates/2014/10/scanbox-framework-whos-affected-and-whos-using-it-1.html)\nactivity involving the Strategic Web Compromise (SWC) framework more commonly known\nas Scanbox. In that operation, the Scanbox code was placed on the website of a U.S.based think tank and utilized the malicious domain, news[.]foundationssl[.]com. The use of\nthe two foundationssl[.]com subdomains suggests that the same adversary (in this case\nDEEP PANDA) was responsible for the signed Derusbi malware file and the think tank SWC\n[activity. Furthermore, CrowdStrike publicly reported on DEEP PANDA targeting of think](http://blog.crowdstrike.com/deep-thought-chinese-targeting-national-security-think-tanks/)\ntanks in July 2014.\n\nIf you want to hear more about DEEP PANDA and their tradecraft or any of the other\n[adversaries that CrowdStrike tracks please contact: sales@crowdstrike com](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:sales@crowdstrike.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n[1] In February 2014, CrowdStrike publicly reported on a campaign that leveraged Sakula\nmalware (http://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/french-connection-french-aerospace-focusedcve-2014-0322-attack-shares-similarities-2012/index.html); however, the Tactics,\nTechniques, and Procedures (TTPs) between that campaign and this recent one are\ndifferent, suggesting two distinct adversaries are using the Sakula malware.\n\nRelated Content\n\nWho is EMBER BEAR?\n\n\n-----\n\nA Tale of Two Cookies: How to Pwn2Own the Cisco RV340 Router\n\n\n-----\n\nPROPHET SPIDER Exploits Citrix ShareFile Remote Code Execution Vulnerability CVE 2021 22941 to\nDeliver Webshell\n\n\n-----",
