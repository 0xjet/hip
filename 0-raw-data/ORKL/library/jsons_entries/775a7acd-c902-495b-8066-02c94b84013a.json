The miner can take advantage\n          of some instructions specific to ARMv5E and later processors,\n          but the decision whether to use them is made at compile time,\n          based on compiler-defined macros.\n          To use NEON instructions, add \"-mfpu=neon\" to CFLAGS.\n     PowerPC: No runtime CPU detection.\n          To use AltiVec instructions, add \"-maltivec\" to CFLAGS.\n     x86: The miner checks for SSE2 instructions support at runtime,\n          and uses them if they are available.\n     x86-64: The miner can take advantage of AVX, AVX2 and XOP instructions,\n          but only if both the CPU and the operating system support them.\n            * Linux supports AVX starting from kernel version 2.6.30.\n            * FreeBSD supports AVX starting with 9.1-RELEASE.\n            * Mac OS X added AVX support in the 10.6.8 update.\n            * Windows supports AVX starting from Windows 7 SP1 and\n             Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1.\n          The configure script outputs a warning if the assembler\n          doesn't support some instruction sets. In that case, the miner\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n          can still be built, but unavailable optimizations are left off.\n          The miner uses the VIA Padlock Hash Engine where available.\nUsage instructions: Run \"minerd --help\" to see options.\nConnecting through a proxy: Use the --proxy option.\nTo use a SOCKS proxy, add a socks4:// or socks5:// prefix to the proxy host.\nProtocols socks4a and socks5h, allowing remote name resolving, are also\navailable since libcurl 7.18.0.\nIf no protocol is specified, the proxy is assumed to be a HTTP proxy.\nWhen the --proxy option is not used, the program honors the http_proxy\nand all_proxy environment variables.\nAlso many issues and FAQs are covered in the forum thread\ndedicated to this program,\n     https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=55038.0\n\n```\n\n-----",
