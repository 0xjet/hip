    "plain_text": "# Week 7: Supposed order confirmation delivers malware and new variants in fake extortion emails\n\n**[ncsc.admin.ch/ncsc/en/home/aktuell/im-fokus/2022/wochenrueckblick_7.html](https://www.ncsc.admin.ch/ncsc/en/home/aktuell/im-fokus/2022/wochenrueckblick_7.html)**\n\nNavigation\n\n**22.02.2022 - Last week, the NCSC received a persistently high number of reports.**\n**Hackers are attempting to distribute remote access malware by means of bogus**\n**order notifications. In addition, there has been an increase in the spread of fake**\n**extortion emails being sent in the name of prosecution authorities, and they are now**\n**written in German as well.**\n\n## Bogus order confirmations contain remote access malware\n\nThe way people shop has changed since 2019, with a shift towards online shopping.\nFraudsters are taking advantage of this trend by sending bogus parcel notifications. In most\ncases, the emails sent involve credit card phishing or ask the recipient to purchase\npaysafecards and provide the codes.\n\nA suspicious email was forwarded to the NCSC last week, and an analysis of it revealed a\nnew modus operandi: The email contained a notification that an order had been received\nand that it was now being processed. Intentionally, the fraudsters did not include any\nreferences to any seller or items purchased; only a meaningless order number was listed.\n\n\n-----\n\nGeneric email with the HTML attachment that leads to the malware\n\nThe attachment is an HTML file with a cryptic name. When this file is executed, the\ndownload of an additional ISO file must be permitted. This is when all alarm bells should be\nringing, at the very latest.\n\nISO files are treated by computers like executable CDs and DVDs, and often contain\ninstallation media for games or office programmes, for example.\n\nWhen the HTML file is opened, information about downloading an ISO file is displayed\n\nIn this case, the program contained malware called AsyncRAT. RAT stands for \"remote\naccess tool\", which allows an attacker to access the infected computer remotely.\n\n\n-----\n\nAnalysis of the ISO file with an appropriate tool indicated the presence of AsyncRAT\nmalware\n\nRemote access to the computer gives an attacker the opportunity to steal data stored on it\nand also to upload and install other malware in order to be able to intercept passwords\nwhen they are entered, for example.\n\n**Be wary all unsolicited email notifications you receive.**\n**Be especially suspicious if you are asked to open or download a file.**\n**Never allow your computer to execute files obtained in this way.**\n**Report such cyberincidents to the NCSC and, if possible, send us the email in**\n**question.**\n\n[NCSC-Reporting form](https://www.report.ncsc.admin.ch/en/)\n\n## Fake extortion emails in the name of various police authorities are now also being sent in German\n\nIn recent weeks, thousands of fake extortion emails written in French in the name of almost\na dozen different law enforcement agencies were found in the email inboxes and spam\nfolders of Swiss citizens. In France, this form of fraud has been known for years. At the end\nof last year, the fraudsters began to focus on the French-speaking part of Switzerland and\nnow more and more emails of this type are appearing in Ticino (with Italian authority logos)\nand in German-speaking Switzerland (with German authority logos).\n\n\n-----\n\nBogus extortion emails in different languages, here in French, Italian and German\n\nThe emails make drastic accusations against the recipients in the name of randomly\ncomposed prosecution authorities. The aim is to get the recipients to reply to the email\naddress mentioned in the letter. If someone contacts the fraudsters, they promise to drop\nthe alleged \"accusations\" against payment of a high four-digit sum of money. However, this\nis not the end of the story for people who do pay the amount requested. In these cases, the\nfraudsters keep coming back with new demands for money until the victim finally realises\nthe fraud and stops paying. The resulting loss can be very considerable.\n\nSince the email addresses used by the fraudsters are crucial for communicating with the\nvictims and sending such messages en masse, the NCSC reports the email addresses\nused by the attackers to the corresponding email providers. Currently, these are mostly\nstudent email accounts at various universities. In some cases, the NCSC's rapid\nintervention stopped further emails from being sent, thus averting potential loss.\n\n**Do not allow yourself to be put under pressure and do not react to such threats.**\n**Ignore such messages and mark them as spam.**\n\n## Current statistics\n\nLast week's reports by category:\n\n[Current figures](https://www.ncsc.admin.ch/ncsc/en/home/aktuell/aktuelle-zahlen.html)\n\nLast modification 22.02.2022\n\n\n-----",
