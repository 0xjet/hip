DanaBot is a banking/stealer malware first discovered](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.danabot)\nby Proofpoint in May 2018. There have been at least three significant versions of the malware:\n\nVersion 1: [DanaBot - A new banking Trojan surfaces Down Under](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/danabot-new-banking-trojan-surfaces-down-under-0)\n\nVersion 2: [DanaBot Gains Popularity and Targets US Organizations in Large Campaigns](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/danabot-gains-popularity-and-targets-us-organizations-large-campaigns)\n\nVersion 3: ESET’s [DanaBot updated with new C&C communication](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2019/02/07/danabot-updated-new-cc-communication/)\n\nThis will be the fourth major update.\n\nFrom May 2018 to June 2020, DanaBot was a fixture in the crimeware threat landscape. Proofpoint researchers observed multiple\nthreat actors with at least 12 affiliate IDs in version 2 and 38 IDs in version 3. These affiliate identifications (IDs) represent the threat\nactors the DanaBot operators serve. Distribution has typically targeted financial institutions predominantly located in the United States,\nCanada, Germany, United Kingdom, Australia, Italy, Poland, Mexico, and Ukraine. After June 2020, there was a sharp decline\n[in DanaBot activity in Proofpoint’s data and in public threat intel repositories (e.g. MalwareBazaar and](https://bazaar.abuse.ch/browse/tag/DanaBot/) [#DanaBot). It disappeared from](https://twitter.com/hashtag/DanaBot)\nthe threat landscape without a clear cause.\n\n[Starting in late October 2020, we observed a significant update to DanaBot samples appearing in VirusTotal. At the time of](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/search)\npublication, Proofpoint researchers spotted two affiliate IDs using this latest version with at least one distribution method. While it has\nnot returned to its former scale, DanaBot is malware that defenders should put back on their radar.\n\n## Malware Analysis\n\n[The sample with a SHA-256 hash of c0eb802f394e758da4feb0d6c3b817bf1f64880ab9bc851937d5ef774161585d was used for this](https://bazaar.abuse.ch/sample/c0eb802f394e758da4feb0d6c3b817bf1f64880ab9bc851937d5ef774161585d/)\nanalysis.\n\nLike previous versions of DanaBot, version 4 is a large, multithreaded, modular malware written in the Delphi programming\nlanguage. A loader component (EXE) decrypts, decompresses, and executes a secondary component (DLL) seen in Figure 1:\n\n_Figure 1: Malware execution_\n\nThe secondary component removes the loader and reruns itself using a specially crafted export name highlighted above in red\nin Figure 1. The export name is base64 decoded and the first three bytes are subtracted from each other (i.e., running_mode = byte_0\n– byte_1 – byte_2). This value determines the running mode of the secondary component, with four options available:\n\n**Running Mode** **Description**\n\n0 Main component\n\n1 TOR component\n\n2 Used for process injection of downloaded files\n\n3 Module component\n\nThis analysis will mostly focus on mode 0, the main component.\n\n## Anti-Analysis\n\nBesides being written in Delphi there are a few other anti-analysis features in the malware:\n\nSome strings are constructed one character at a time (Figure 2)\n\n\n-----\n\nSome Windows API functions are resolved at run time\n\nWhen a malware-related file is read or written to the filesystem, it is done in the middle of benign decoy file reads or writes\n\nPersistence is maintained by creating an LNK file that executes the main component in the user’s Startup directory. This file is\nonly written once a WM_QUERYENDSESSION Windows event is received when the user logs off\n\n_Figure 2: String obfuscation example, where strings are constructed one character at a time_\n\n## Configuration\n\nDanaBot’s configuration is hardcoded into a 356-byte structure (Figure 3):\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3: Configuration structure of DanaBot_\n\nKey configuration items are highlighted in red in Figure 3 and include the following:\n\n## Affiliate ID\n\n[As previously reported in DanaBot control panel revealed, we believe DanaBot is set up as a “malware as a service” in which one](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/danabot-control-panel-revealed)\nthreat actor controls a global command and control (C&C) panel and infrastructure then sells access to other threat actors known as\naffiliates.\n\nThis field likely represents the ID of the affiliate associated with the sample. At the time of publication, only two IDs were found: 3 and\n21. It is currently unclear whether version 4 affiliate IDs will overlap with previous version affiliate IDs, though they did change between\nversions 2 and 3.\n\n## Embedded Hash\n\nIt is currently unclear what the following embedded hash values represent:\n\nE1D3580C52F82AF2B3596E20FB85D9F4\n\nDE420A65BFC5F29167A85A5199065A0E\n\nE0ECDBB46B59DFAB6F7CB1136E7496F5\n\n429B39BF421C0F74463EF2A17209ADAA\n\n6266E79288DFE2AE2C2DB47563C7F93A\n\nDE6DF8FA2198DD77CFD93D89D8ECC62D\n\n\n-----\n\n## Version\n\nThis field below likely represents a version number that increments in newer samples:\n\n1650\n\n1701\n\n1705\n\n1732\n\n1755\n\n## C&C IP Addresses and Ports\n\nThe IP addresses are hardcoded as DWORD values and are set to the following in the analyzed sample:\n\n23[.]226.132.92\n\n23[.]106.123.249\n\n108[.]62.141.152\n\n104[.]144.64.163\n\nVersion 3 of DanaBot mixed in decoy C&C addresses, but it does not appear version 4 is making use of them.\n\n## TOR\n\nDanaBot has functionality to switch to TOR-based C&C. The analyzed sample contains the following hardcoded onion hostname:\n\n5jjsgjephjcua63go2o5donzw5x4hiwn6wh2dennmyq65pbhk6qflzyd\\.onion\n\n## Command and Control\n\nThe C&C protocol in version 4 is similar to version 3. An example request is shown in Figure 4:\n\n_Figure 4: Example C&C request_\n\nIt is still a binary protocol using mostly TCP port 443. Requests and responses have a plaintext header (highlighted in blue in Figure 4)\nfollowed by command data (highlighted in purple). The header is 28-bytes and has the following fields:\n\n\n-----\n\nOffset Size Name Notes\n\n0x00 8-bytes Data length\n\n0x08 4-bytes Data compression/encryption mode Four modes, described below\n\n0x0c 8-bytes Random value\n\n0x14 8-bytes Checksum Value = data length + random value\n\nThe command data structure is:\n\nAES-encrypted data\n\nPadding length (4-bytes)\n\nRSA-encrypted session key\n\nRSA Signature (in responses)\n\nDepending on the command, data can be compressed using zlib (mode 1), ZIP (mode 2), or not compressed (modes 0 and 3).\n\nData is encrypted with AES-256 in CBC mode using a generated session key. In modes 0, 1, and 2, the session key is randomly\ngenerated and encrypted with RSA. For requests to the C&C server, an embedded public RSA key is used. For responses from the\nC&C server, a generated RSA key is used (see below). For mode 3, the session key is CryptDeriveKey’d based on the MD5 uppercase\nhex digest of the bot ID.\n\nResponses from the C&C also contain an RSA signature which is verified using an embedded public RSA key.\n\nThe first request to the C&C server is a key exchange where an RSA key pair is generated by the malware, and the public key is sent\nto the C&C server. There is no response from the C&C for this request. Session keys used in future responses from the C&C server\nwill be encrypted using this key.\n\nThe second request is an initial beacon to the C&C server. The data is a 479-byte structure containing:\n\n**Offset** **Size** **Name** **Notes**\n\n0x00 4-bytes Length\n\n0x04 8-bytes Random value\n\n0x0C 8-bytes Checksum Value = data length + random value\n\n0x14 4-bytes Affiliate ID See Configuration section above\n\n0x18 4-bytes Command Described below\n\n0x1c 4-bytes Sub-command Described below\n\n0x20 4-bytes Version See Configuration section above\n\n0x24 4-bytes Is admin flag\n\n0x28 4-bytes Process integrity level\n\n0x2c 4-bytes Architecture\n\n\n-----\n\n0x30 4-bytes Windows version Encoded into a DWORD value\n\n0x34 4-bytes Time zone bias\n\n0x38 36-bytes Unknown null bytes\n\n0x5c 41-bytes Bot ID Prepended with string length and CRC32 value.\n\nMD5 uppercase hex digest of hardware profile GUID\n\n0x85 41-bytes Embedded hash value Prepended with string length and CRC32 value.\n\nSee Configuration section above\n\n0xae 41-bytes Checksum 2 Prepended with string length and CRC32 value.\n\nMD5 uppercase hex digest of affiliate ID, bot ID, and embedded hash\nvalues concatenated together\n\n\n0xd7 41-bytes MD5 uppercase hex digest of three\nrandom values\n\n0x100 remaining Unknown null bytes\n\n\nPrepended with string length and CRC32 value\n\n\nOnce decrypted (this particular response uses mode 0 and an extra layer of mode 3), the response from the C&C for the initial\nbeacon is an echo of the request.\n\nOther commands use similar structures but will not be detailed in this post.\n\n## Commands\n\nSome of the main C&C commands we have identified include:\n\n**Command 1024, Sub-command 0**\n\nThe initial beacon described in the C&C section above.\n\n**Command 2048, Sub-command 0**\n\nThis command returns three hash values. It is unclear what the hashes are of, but they represent:\n\nCurrent set of “CommandRecord”s\n\nCurrent set of modules and/or files to download and execute\n\nCurrent set of “OnlineRec”s\n\n**Command 2048, Sub-command 1**\n\nGet updated list of C&C IP addresses.\n\n**Command 2048, Sub-command 2**\n\nThis command returns a list of hash values. The hash values represent individual “CommandRecord”s.\n\n**Command 2048, Sub-command 3**\n\nThis command is used to fetch a “CommandRecord”. These records map to three commands:\n\nSwitch to TOR C&C communications\n\nSet C&C sleep value\n\nEnable the built-in stealer and system information components\n\n\n-----\n\nThe stealer component steals credentials from various software such as web browsers and File Transfer Protocol (FTP) clients. The\nsystem information component collects system information seen below in Figure 5:\n\n_Figure 5: Example output from stealer/system information report_\n\n**Command 2048, Sub-command 4**\n\nThis command is used to send arbitrary data such as an initial screenshot and report from the stealer/system\ninformation components to the C&C server.\n\n**Command 2048, Sub-command 6**\n\n[This command returns a set of “OnlineRec”s. Referencing our DanaBot control panel revealed blog post, these records seem to map](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/danabot-control-panel-revealed)\nto similar functionality accessible from the “Online” tab of the version 3 control panel seen below in Figure 6:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6: “Online” tab of version 3 control panel_\n\nThis includes functionality such as command shell, file system access, screen/keyboard/mouse access, and SOCKS proxy.\n\n**Command 2048, Sub-command 8**\n\nNote: all run modes detailed below reference the malware execution section above\n\nThis command returns a list of hashes. The hash values represent individual file records. File records are downloaded with command\n2048, sub-command 9. File records are used to download files or modules to execute. Executable files can be run using:\n\nregsvr32.exe\n\nrundll32.exe\n\nCreateProcess\n\nProcess injection into secondary component using running mode 2\n\nModules are known as “MLocalProcess”s and are loaded into secondary components using run mode 3. They communicate with the\nmain component over a localhost connection. At the time of publication, we have not seen any modules being distributed by the C&Cs.\nBased on previous versions of DanaBot, we suspect that the modules will enable the following functionality:\n\nPerson-in-the-browser functionality along with web injects\n\nVideo recording of the screen\n\nKeylogging\n\nVNC/RDP\n\n**Command 2048, Sub-command 10**\n\nUsed to download TOR. The TOR client will be loaded into a secondary component using running mode 1.\n\n## Distribution Via Cracks Websites\n\n\n-----\n\nProofpoint researchers were able to narrow down at least one of the DanaBot distribution methods to various software warez\nand cracks websites that supposedly offer software keys and cracks for a free download, including anti-virus programs, VPNs, graphics\neditors, document editors, and games. However, the files distributed by these sites are a bundle of several different malware,\nincluding DanaBot.\n\n_Figure 7: The investigation into warez sites started from a December 22, 2020 blog on Dalvik Planet_\n\n_Figure 8: Example of a cracks site offering a popular graphics editor keygen for download_\n\nA random file “600117809bae5__Adobe-Photoshop-CC-2211138-Crack-Incl-Keygen-X64-2021.zip” was downloaded and\nanalyzed from one of the sites. It contained several “README” files and a password-protected archive containing the initial dropper for\nthe malware bundle, “setup_x86_x64_install.exe.”\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 9: A zip archive downloaded from a warez site containing the initial dropper for the malware bundle_\n\nRunning this executable generated the following traffic.\n\n_Figure 10: Network traffic resulting from running “setup_x86_x64_install.exe”_\n\nA brief description of this traffic and the malware components is below, but we have not conducted a full analysis of the files.\n\n1. Stage 1: drops and runs a stealer component and downloads stage 2\n\n1.a. Stealer: the first two network requests, hxxp[:]//eressedn27[.]top/index.php and hxxp://morttttq12[.]top/index.php, belong to the\nstealer component. The stealer collects and uploads a zip with information about the infected machine, including:\n\nBrowser's information: saved username and password values, saved forms, credit card-related information, and cookies—from\nbrowsers including Chrome, Brave, Vivaldi, Opera, Avast, Firefox\n\nScreenshot: screenshot of the Desktop\n\nSystem Information: Operating System, language, keyboard languages, local time, username, CPU, RAM, video\ncard, display resolution, installed software\n\nCryptocurrency / wallets: we observed strings (but did not confirm exact functionality) related to cryptocurrency wallets and\nexchanges such as: Coinomi, waves-exchange, Ledger Live, Electrum, Electron Cash, Jaxx, Exodus, MultiBitHD, and Atomic.\n\n1.b. Downloads stage 2: the following network request is a download of the next stage, “lv.exe”\n\n2. Stage 2: drops a miner and downloads DanaBot\n\n2.a. Miner: a file is dropped (not analyzed) that appears to be an AutoIT cryptocurrency miner\n\n2.b. Download DanaBot: DanaBot is downloaded from hxxp[:]//45.147.230[.]58/palata.exe\n\n\n-----\n\n[Research performed by CSIS (Center for Strategic and International Studies) appears consistent with the same actor that Proofpoint](https://medium.com/csis-techblog/gcleaner-garbage-provider-since-2019-2708e7c87a8a)\nresearchers found. CSIS described a different malware bundle that may include AZORult, Predator the Thief, Smoke Loader, Redline\nStealer, Amadey, Ficker Stealer, and Raccoon Stealer. However, this is likely due to the involvement of a Traffic Direction System\n(TDS) serving different payloads depending on factors such as geographic location of the\nvictim. The Indicators of Compromise (IOC) reported by CSIS included the domain chromebooster[.]com which Proofpoint also observed in our network traffic screenshot (above) leading to the download\nof DanaBot via a 302 redirect. Finally, the CSIS research described the number of infections in hundreds of thousands in a span of\napproximately 1 month. The infections focused on quantity instead of quality and ranged across many countries including United\nStates, Canada, India, Turkey, Brazil, and others.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nFor almost two years, DanaBot was one of the top banking malwares being used in the crimeware threat landscape. Multiple threat\nactors were distributing and using it to target financials in many countries. In the middle of 2020, DanaBot activity dropped off. Some of\n[the affiliates that were using it have continued their campaigns using other banking malware (e.g. Ursnif and](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.gozi) [Zloader). It is unclear](https://zeusmuseum.com/zloader%202/)\nwhether COVID-19, competition from other banking malware, redevelopment time, or something else caused the dip, but it looks\nlike DanaBot is back and trying to regain its foothold in the threat landscape. We assess the number of DanaBot affiliates will grow and\nthat DanaBot will once again be distributed via phishing campaigns within the next few months.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n**Indicator** **Type** **Notes**\n\nc0eb802f394e758da4feb0d6c3b817bf1f64880ab9bc851937d5ef774161585d SHA-256 Analyzed sample, affiliate ID 3\n\n\n23.226.132.92 IP\nAddress\n\n23.106.123.249 IP\nAddress\n\n108.62.141.152 IP\nAddress\n\n104.144.64.163 IP\nAddress\n\n\nC2 of analyzed sample\n\nC2 of analyzed sample\n\nC2 of analyzed sample\n\nC2 of analyzed sample\n\n\n5jjsgjephjcua63go2o5donzw5x4hiwn6wh2dennmyq65pbhk6qflzyd\\.onion Hostname TOR C2 of analyzed sample\n\n83a67ecd166b919255b264718993c284a3238971a24c939c45e0c525f3361a43 SHA-256 Affiliate ID 21\n\n\n149.129.212.179 IP\nAddress\n\n47.254.247.133 IP\nAddress\n\n159.89.114.62 IP\nAddress\n\n138.197.139.56 IP\nAddress\n\n\nC2 of affiliate ID 21 sample\n\nC2 of affiliate ID 21 sample\n\nC2 of affiliate ID 21 sample\n\nC2 of affiliate ID 21 sample\n\n\nab3c72aaacbe2c99646bf4d91e177585631b164f8cd9e9e5eb7a180ce7d945d5 SHA-256 600117809bae5__Adobe-PhotoshopCC-2211138-Crack-Incl-Keygen-X642021.zip\n\n\n-----\n\nceb0ad27aaf97a5a33664f49aa107ca421c3f0a6e0b9a3c37f93455a258f3c04 SHA-256 DanaBot downloaded\nfrom hxxp[:]//45.147.230[.]58/palata.exe\n\n**Emerging Threats Signatures**\n\nETPRO TROJAN Danabot Key Exchange Request\n\nETPRO TROJAN Danabot Command Beacon Request\n\n_[Is your institution protected against malware attacks?
