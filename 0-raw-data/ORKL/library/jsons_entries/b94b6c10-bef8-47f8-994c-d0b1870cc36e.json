Mao Zedong’s man in charge was one of the\n[biggest master spies of the period, Li Kenong. Though Mao later regretted cultivating the](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08850607.2015.1022467?journalCode=ujic20)\n“special product,” which he called “that certain thing,” the drug caused disruption in the\nenemy rear and benefited the Red-area economy.\n\nNow it seems to be applying the same strategy in the West’s rear area, causing disruptions\nto online systems and simultaneously benefiting the Chinese economy with viruses and\nworms used to steal information from computer systems worldwide The latest simultaneous\n\n\n-----\n\nexploit against thousands of organizations, disclosed on March 2, was dubbed the Microsoft\nExchange hack, exploiting servers that manage email systems. The hack allows perpetrators\n[to read messages of selected targets and then venture deeper into infected networks.](https://www.wired.com/story/china-russia-spying-sprees-years-to-unpack/)\n\nOver [60,000 organizations in the U.S. and at least 280,000 users worldwide using Microsoft](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22319934/microsoft-hafnium-hack-exchange-server-email-flaw-white-house)\n[Exchange for their email were hacked between Feb. 26 and March 3, according to Chris](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/03/at-least-30000-u-s-organizations-newly-hacked-via-holes-in-microsofts-email-software/)\nKrebs, the former director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. The\norganizations include defense contractors, universities, state and local governments, policy\nthink tanks, infectious disease researchers, and businesses: anyone that chose to use\nMicrosoft Exchange for their email service.\n\nThe unidentified organization behind the hack, assessed by Microsoft to be a Chinese statesponsored entity, is known by the code name HAFNIUM. The hack has enabled\nunauthorized access to entire email systems and follow-on access to connected databases\nthat store classified information, trade secrets, the wide range of other proprietary\ninformation, and personally identifiable information such as names, addresses, Social\nSecurity numbers, and so on that is useful for identity theft.\n\n[Named after a chemical element discovered in 1923, HAFNIUM is a new activity and not yet](https://www.britannica.com/science/hafnium)\nclearly identified to the point where it would receive a cryptonym such as “TURBINE\nPANDA”—the name given to the cyber espionage activities at the infamous Jiangsu State\nSecurity Bureau.\n\n[TURBINE PANDA is linked to the 2014 OPM hack, another massive data breach, and to the](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3318238/the-opm-hack-explained-bad-security-practices-meet-chinas-captain-america.html)\ncase of [Yanjun Xu, the State Security officer extradited to the U.S. from Belgium for](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/chinese-intelligence-officer-charged-economic-espionage-involving-theft-trade-secrets-leading)\nattempted theft of GE advanced jet engine technology.\n\nBad actors in China and beyond, whether working on behalf of intelligence services or\n[criminal organizations, are expected to rapidly develop HAFNIUM “proof of concept exploits,”](https://hothardware.com/news/microsoft-removes-exchange-server-exploit-proof-of-concept-from-github)\ni.e. to show that they can use the vulnerability to burrow into a target system by performing\nbenign tasks like opening up the calculator, or moving the cursor. From there, it is a short\nstep to weaponizing the exploit with malware.\n\nAccording to an industry source, several other Chinese hacking groups may have used the\nsame [zero-day vulnerabilities as did HAFNIUM. Criminal organizations outside China have](https://us.norton.com/internetsecurity-emerging-threats-how-do-zero-day-vulnerabilities-work-30sectech.html)\n[already employed ransomware using the vulnerability a mere nine days after it was](https://redmondmag.com/blogs/scott-bekker/2021/03/exchange-hafnium-attacks-ransomware.aspx)\ndiscovered, faster than in previous cases.\n\nThat will further challenge cybersecurity detectives in their attempts to attribute the attacks to\nspecific entities.\n\n[The situation is so toxic that the Biden administration issued a public warning on March 12](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/white-house-warns-organizations-have-hours-not-days-to-fix-vulnerabilities-as-microsoft-exchange-attacks-increase/ar-BB1ewPRh)\nthat organizations “have hours, not days” to update exposed servers with software patches\nalready issued by Microsoft. Ordinary users may have noticed two long updates from\nMicrosoft in the past week that are intended to eliminate vulnerabilities\n\n\n-----\n\nThat Microsoft has identified HAFNIUM as a Chinese state-sponsored actor indicates that\nBeijing’s security services, likely the Ministry of State Security (MSS), continue to pursue the\n[massive harvesting of data such as the 2017 APT 3 exploit, attributed to the Guangdong](https://www.recordedfuture.com/chinese-mss-behind-apt3/)\nState Security Bureau.\n\nIt is no surprise that the multi-stage, malicious HAFNIUM operation from China against\nMicrosoft Exchange servers bears some operational resemblance to the SolarWinds attack\nfrom Russia. Both rely on widespread use of a targeted system, i.e. Solar Winds and\nMicrosoft Exchange, as the vector to reach the real objective: the tens of thousands of users\nwho possess sensitive information like U.S. defense production data, weapons systems\ndesigns, trade secrets useful to China’s latest Five-Year Plan, and the emails of Beijing’s\nperceived political enemies.\n\nThese intelligence objectives are reminiscent of the targets of Russian and Chinese\ncommunist intelligence agencies over the past century. From the late 1920s until the late\n[1950s, the spy services of Russia and communist China shared selected information about](https://www.amazon.com/Chinese-Communist-Espionage-Intelligence-Primer/dp/1682473031/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=Chinese+Communist+Espionage&link_code=qs&qid=1615603394&sr=8-2)\ntheir common enemies: Japan and Germany in World War II, the U.S. and its allies early in\nthe Cold War.\n\nIt remains to be seen if evidence emerges of modern-day cooperation between Moscow and\nBeijing, whose relations have steadily improved since the collapse of the Soviet Union in\n1991, to research and carry out cyber attacks. Although it is a tenuous link, evidence\n[emerged on March 8 that hackers from China targeted SolarWinds customers in an](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/03/chinese-hackers-targeted-solarwinds-customers-in-parallel-with-russian-op/)\noperation that was distinct from the related Russian attacks.\n\nThese exploits underline how large scale computer network exploitation in the 21st century\nhas reshaped technical intelligence collection, and not just among the superpowers. During\nthe Cold War, useful signal intelligence operations required the resources of an advanced\nindustrial state. Now the advantage in conducting massive, devastating hacks belongs to\nwhatever player, large or small, has the best software developers.\n\nThe new battlefield, with its potential for attacks on power grids, hospitals, and sensitive\nfacilities like nuclear power plants, puts entire populations in significant danger.\n\n[Although individual users may feel helpless in this Black Mirror-type scenario, they have](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/black_mirror)\nwithin their grasp several easy fixes that anyone, technical or not, can employ.\n\n[The first step is to enable two-factor authentication in application launches whenever](https://www.wired.com/story/protect-accounts-two-factor-authentication/)\npossible. This makes it difficult for a third party to intrude into your account if they have\nmanaged to steal your password.\n\n[Second, and the most common and yet commonly ignored advisory: Don’t ever click on links](https://www.wired.com/2015/04/hacker-lexicon-spear-phishing/)\nin emails unless you are certain that they are legitimate. That’s how adversaries have gained\nentrance to Pentagon computers again and again.\n\n\n-----\n\nJust. Don t. Click. Unless you want to end up like Hillary Clinton s campaign chairman John\nPodesta, with your emails hacked and shared with the world.\n\nThird, users exchanging sensitive information especially should employ a virtual private\n[network (VPN) to hide their traffic. In this day and age, why not obscure every keystroke and](https://www.wired.com/story/best-vpn/)\nweb search from prying eyes?\n\nFourth, never put off software updates. There is a big market internationally not only for zeroday vulnerabilities, but also for one-day (publicly known and patched) vulnerabilities. Why? A\nhigh percentage of users skip updates, leaving themselves open to well-known exploits\n[already publicly shared worldwide on Github, the open, cloud-based software sharing](https://github.com/)\nservice,\n\nOnce an exploit is posted on Github, anyone can use it. Criminals then go after low hanging\nfruit, including the vast number of people who don’t bother with software updates and\npatches. That especially includes those using pirated software. Previously a cheap\nalternative, pirated software has become the Typhoid Mary of the digital space.\n\nNeed some motivation to do the right things? Take a look at _This Is How They Tell Me the_\n_World Ends, a scary exposé of the worldwide cyber weapons market that is partly fueled by_\nAmerican taxpayer dollars. China is certainly watching.\n\n_[Co-published with SpyTalk, where Jeff Stein leads an all-star team of veteran investigative](https://www.spytalk.co/)_\n_reporters, writers, and subject-matter experts who will take you behind the scenes of the_\n_[national security state.
