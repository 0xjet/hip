This ransomware has had numerous\nvariants released with the most active current one being the one that appends the\n.Nano extension.\n\nThe [Aurora Ransomware family is spread by attackers hacking into computers running](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/aurora-zorro-ransomware-actively-being-distributed/)\nRemote Desktop Services. Once they gain access to a computer, they install the\nransomware and encrypt any files that they gain access to. Once files are encrypted they\nwill have an extension appended to the file names and a ransom note will be created on the\nWindows desktop and in various folders on the computer.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Encrypted .Nano Files**\nThe good news is that the variants of this ransomware family can be decrypted for free\n[using a decryptor created by Michael Gillespie. In order to use the decryptor a victim just](https://twitter.com/demonslay335)\nneeds to have two encrypted files of a certain file type, which will be described later in the\nguide.\n\nThe currently supported variants are the ones that append the following extensions to the\nnames of encrypted files.\n```\n.Nano\n.animus\n.Aurora\n.desu\n.ONI\n.aurora\n\n```\nTo learn how to decrypt files encrypted by the Aurora Ransomware, please use the guide\nbelow.\n\n## How to Decrypt the Aurora Ransomware\n\nVictims of the Aurora Ransomware can be identified by having their files encrypted and\nrenamed to have a .Nano, .animus, .Aurora, .desu, .ONI, or .aurora extension.\n\nTo decrypt files encrypted by the Aurora ransomware, you need to first download the Aurora\nDecryptor below.\n\nAuroraDecrypter\n\n\n-----\n\n[Download Now](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/auroradecrypter/)\nOnce downloaded, simply double-click on the executable to start the decryptor and you will\nbe greeted with the main screen.\n\n**Decryptor**\n\n**Screen**\nIn order to brute force the decryption key, we need two encrypted files of a certain file types.\nThe supported file types are:\n```\n.png, .gif, .pdf, .docx, .xlsx, .pptx, .doc, .xls, .ppt, .vsd, .psd, .mp3, .wmv,\n.zip, .rar, .pst, .rtf, .mdb, .ico, .lnk, .fdb, .jar, and .idx\n\n```\nOnce you have located two of one of the above file types, click on the Settings menu and\nselect Bruteforcer. This will open a screen where you should select two encrypted files as\nillustrated below.\n\n**Select files to bruteforce**\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce you have selected both files, click on the Start button to begin brute forcing the\ndecryption key. This process can take quite a while, so please be patient.\n\n**Bruteforcing Key**\n\nWhen finished, the decryptor will state that a decryption key has been found.\n\n**Decryption Key Found**\n\nNow click the X button to close the BruteForcer window and the key will be loaded into the\ndecryptor as shown below.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Decryption**\n\n**Key Loaded**\nWe now need to select a directory to decrypt by clicking on the Select Directory button. If\nyou wish to decrypt an entire drive, simply select the drive letter itself. For example, in the\nimage below you can see that we selected the C:\\ drive.\n\n**Drive**\n\n**Selected**\nWhen ready, click on the Decrypt button to begin decrypting the Aurora Ransomware\nencrypted files. Once you click Decrypt, the program will decrypt all the encrypted files and\ndisplay the decryption status in the window. This is illustrated below where you see files\nencrypted by the Nano variant of Aurora being decrypted.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Decrypting**\n\n**Aurora Encrypted Files**\nWhen it has finished, the decryptor will display a summary of the amount of files that have\nbeen decrypted. If some of the files were skipped it may be due to permissions to the files.\n\n**Decryption**\n\n**Finished**\nThough your files are now decrypted, the original encrypted files will still be on your\ncomputer. Once you confirm that your files have been properly decrypted, you can use\n[CryptoSearch to move all the encrypted files into one folder so you can delete or archive](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cryptosearch-finds-files-encrypted-by-ransomware-moves-them-to-new-location/)\nthem.\n\nYou can now close the decryptor and use your computer as normal. If you need help using\nthis decryptor, feel free to leave a comment.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n\n-----\n\n[Free decryptor released for Yanluowang ransomware victims](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/free-decryptor-released-for-yanluowang-ransomware-victims/)\n\n[Windows 11 KB5014019 breaks Trend Micro ransomware protection](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-11-kb5014019-breaks-trend-micro-ransomware-protection/)\n\n[Industrial Spy data extortion market gets into the ransomware game](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/industrial-spy-data-extortion-market-gets-into-the-ransomware-game/)\n\n[New ‘Cheers’ Linux ransomware targets VMware ESXi servers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-cheers-linux-ransomware-targets-vmware-esxi-servers/)\n\n[SpiceJet airline passengers stranded after ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/spicejet-airline-passengers-stranded-after-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[Aurora](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/aurora/)\n[AuroraDecrypter](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/auroradecrypter/)\n[Decrypted](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/decrypted/)\n[Decryptor](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/decryptor/)\n[Nano](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/nano/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.

Backups should always be kept because one should\nnever say never and assume their files are lost to these criminals.\n\nPost a Comment [Community Rules](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/posting-guidelines/)\n\n\n-----\n\nYou need to login in order to post a comment\n\n[Not a member yet?
