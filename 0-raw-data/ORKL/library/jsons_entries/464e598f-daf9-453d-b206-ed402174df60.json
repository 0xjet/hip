Home](https://www.contextis.com/en/)\n[2. Recent News](https://www.contextis.com/en/news)\n3. Context Identifies new AVIVORE threat group\n\n03 Oct 2019\n\nThe Threat Intelligence and Incident Response Team at Context Information Security has\nidentified a new threat group behind a series of incidents targeted at the aerospace and\ndefence industries in the UK and Europe. Named by Context as AVIVORE, the group is not\npreviously publicly known or reported and Context believes it is responsible for the recently\nreported attacks within the aerospace and defence supply chain.\n\nContext has been investigating attacks against large multinational firms that compromise\nsmaller engineering services and consultancy companies in the supply chain for more than\n12 months. The attackers use legitimate remote connectivity or other collaborative working\nsolutions to bypass the generally well-defended perimeters and gain access to the target.\nThis technique, referred to as ‘Island Hopping’, has also seen the adversary leverage\nchains of activity or connections across multiple business units or geographical locations\nwithin victim environments.\n\nAs a result of its discoveries, Context has been working closely with victims, security\norganisations and law enforcement agencies across Europe, including the UK’s National\nCyber Security Centre (NCSC), in order to reduce the impact and prevent further\ncompromises. In addition to aerospace and defence engineering victims, Context has seen\nAVIVORE target assets related to other verticals including automotive, consultancy,\nenergy/nuclear and space and satellite technology. Context also assesses with moderate\nconfidence that the objective of the campaign is intellectual property theft.\n\n“Previous reporting into recent incidents affecting aerospace and defence have linked this\nactivity to APT10 and JSSD (Jiangsu Province Ministry of State Security). Though the\nnature of the activity makes attribution challenging, our experience of the campaign\nsuggests a new group that we have codenamed AVIVORE,” said Oliver Fay, Principal\nThreat Intelligence Analyst at Context.\n\nWhilst AVIVORE has been observed operating in the UTC+8 timezone and makes use of\nthe PlugX Remote Access Trojan shared with APT10 and other actors, the Tactics,\nTechniques and Procedures (TTPs) infrastructure and other tooling differ significantly This\n\n\n-----\n\nleads Context to believe that this activity is attributed to a previously untracked nation-state\nlevel adversary.\n\nAVIVORE has shown itself to be a highly capable threat actor, adept at both ‘living-off-theland’ and masquerading its activity within the ‘business as usual’ activities of employees in\nits victim organisations. It has also shown a high degree of operational security awareness,\nincluding routinely clearing forensic artefacts as it progresses, making detection and\ninvestigation difficult.\n\n“The capability of the threat actor makes detecting these incidents challenging, however the\ncomplex nature of the supplier relationship makes investigation, co-operation and\nremediation a significant issue,” said James Allman-Talbot, Head of Cyber Incident\nResponse at Context. “When the organisation that has enabled the intrusion forms a critical\npart of your value chain, the operational business risk increases dramatically and difficult\ndecisions need to be made in a short space of time.”\n\nTo mitigate against these attacks, Context recommends the following measures:\n\nImpose access limitations on supplier connections over VPNs, such as preventing\ntheir use outside of the supplier’s business hours or from IP addresses and locations\nother than those pre-agreed and restrict access only to data and assets they require\nto perform their actions.\n\nEnsure that security measures, such as multifactor authentication and enhanced\nauditing/logging are deployed to hosts and services into which suppliers are required\nto connect, in order to prevent or support the investigation of any suspicious user\nbehaviour.\n\nEnsure that external remote access services implement appropriate log retention,\nincluding sources of inbound connections and that identification of concurrent or\nadjacent geographically-impossible connections is possible.\n\nEnsure that credentials for highly privileged accounts and remote services are stored\nsecurely and their use is appropriately monitored. Hosts such as domain controllers,\nsensitive file shares and Public Key Infrastructure servers, should also be subject to\nadditional scrutiny and monitoring.\n\nWhere possible, applications, documentation and technical information related to\nnetwork infrastructure and configuration of remote access services should be made\navailable only to engineers, IT support staff and other individuals with legitimate\nbusiness needs.\n\nFor a more detailed blog on AVIVORE, please go to:\n[https://www.contextis.com/en/blog/avivore](https://www.contextis.com/en/blog/avivore)\n\n\n-----\n\nLearn more about AVIVORE with our Webinar: Defending against new AVIVORE threat\n[group.
