This data is then used in a double-extortion tactic where they\nthreaten to release the data if a ransom is not paid.\n\nWhen data is published, it can be damaging to the victim and their customers, as the stolen\ndata could contain personal information, credit cards, social security numbers, and even\ngovernment-issued identification.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Clop warns customers of impending data leaks\n\nAfter the Clop gang stole data from jet maker Bombardier in an Accellion hack, they leaked a\nsmall amount on their ransomware data leak site. A week later, the threat actors began\nemailing journalists to let them know that further data would be released.\n\nAs Bombardier had already disclosed the data breach, this tactic did not work as hoped by\nthe threat actors.\n\nHowever, Clop has now taken it a step further and directly emailed victims' customers found\nin files or database dumps stolen during the ransomware attack.\n\nThe tactic first started with Flagstar Bank customers and then with people exposed in the\nUniversity of Colorado's Accellion hack.\n\nIn an email seen by BleepignComputer, Clop is now using the same tactic to the customers\nof an online maternity clothing store, which will not be naming.\n\nIn these emails, Clop is sending customers threatening emails with the subject \"Your\npersonal data has been stolen and will be published.\"\n\nThese emails say that the recipient is being contacted as they are a customer of the store,\nand their personal data, including phone numbers, email addresses, and credit card\ninformation, will soon be published if the store does not pay a ransom.\n\n\"Perhaps you bought something there and left your personal data. Such as phone, email,\naddress, credit card information and social security number,\" the Clop gang states in the\nemail.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Email to customer's of an online store**\n\nClop then tells the customer to \"Call or write to this store and ask to protect your privacy!!!!\"\n\nIn other words, the Clop gang is hoping that if enough customers contact the store about\ntheir stolen data, the store will pay the ransom to prevent the data from being published.\n\nWhile I do not think this tactic will work, it illustrates the continuing pressure ransomware\ngangs apply to victims by leaking their data and scaring their customers.\n\nClop is not alone in their attempts to apply maximum pressure on victims to get them to pay\nransoms.\n\nEarlier this month, we reported that the REvil ransomware operation was planning\non [DDoSing victims or making VOIP calls to victims' customers to apply further pressure.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-gang-plans-to-call-victims-business-partners-about-attacks/)\n\n\n-----\n\nSadly, regardless of whether a ransom is paid, consumers whose data has been stolen are\nstill at risk as there is no way of knowing if ransomware gangs delete the data as they\npromise.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Industrial Spy data extortion market gets into the ransomware game](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/industrial-spy-data-extortion-market-gets-into-the-ransomware-game/)\n\n[Shutterfly discloses data breach after Conti ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/shutterfly-discloses-data-breach-after-conti-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[New ‘Cheers’ Linux ransomware targets VMware ESXi servers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-cheers-linux-ransomware-targets-vmware-esxi-servers/)\n\n[General Motors credential stuffing attack exposes car owners info](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/general-motors-credential-stuffing-attack-exposes-car-owners-info/)\n\n[New RansomHouse group sets up extortion market, adds first victims](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-ransomhouse-group-sets-up-extortion-market-adds-first-victims/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
