As part of our response to the SUNBURST vulnerability, the code-signing certificate used by SolarWinds to sign the affected software\nversions was revoked March 8, 2021. This is industry-standard best practice for software that has been compromised.\n\nWe’ve obtained new digital code-signing certificates and have rebuilt the versions signed with the certificate to be revoked, have re-signed our\ncode, and have re-released all of the products previously signed with the certificate to be revoked. To ensure the performance of your\nSolarWinds product(s), you must upgrade to these new builds.\n\nFor full details on this part of our response to the SUNBURST vulnerability, please visit our SolarWinds New Digital Code-Signing\n**Certificate page at** [solarwinds.com/trust-center/new-digital-certificate.](https://www.solarwinds.com/trust-center/new-digital-certificate)\n\n**ABOUT SUPERNOVA**\n\nSUPERNOVA is malware that was deployed using a vulnerability in the Orion Platform, and after the Orion Platform had been installed. Based\non our investigation to date:\n\n\n-----\n\nSU O s ot a c ous code e bedded t t e bu ds o ou O o ® at o as a supp y c a attac t s a a e t at s\nseparately placed on a server that requires unauthorized access to a customer’s network and is designed to appear to be part of a\nSolarWinds product.\nThe SUPERNOVA malware consisted of two components. The first was a malicious, unsigned webshell .dll\n“app_web_logoimagehandler.ashx.b6031896.dll” specifically written to be used on the SolarWinds Orion Platform. The second is the\nutilization of a vulnerability in the Orion Platform to enable deployment of the malicious code. This vulnerability in the Orion Platform has\nbeen resolved in the latest updates.\n\nWe constantly work to enhance the security of our products and to protect our customers and ourselves because hackers and other\ncybercriminals are always seeking new ways to find and attack their victims. We work closely with our customers to address and remediate\nany potential concerns, and we encourage all customers to run only supported versions of our products and to upgrade to the latest versions to\nthe get the full benefit of our updates, improvements, and enhancements.\n\n**ABOUT SUNBURST**\n\nSolarWinds and our customers were the victims of a cyberattack to our systems that inserted a vulnerability (SUNBURST) within our Orion®\nPlatform software builds for versions 2019.4 HF 5, 2020.2 unpatched, and 2020.2 HF 1, which, if present and activated, could potentially allow\nan attacker to compromise the server on which the Orion products run. This attack was a very sophisticated supply chain attack, which refers\nto a disruption in a standard process resulting in a compromised result with a goal of being able to attack subsequent users of the software. In\nthis case, it appears that the code was intended to be used in a targeted way as its exploitation requires manual intervention. We’ve been\nadvised that the nature of this attack indicates that it may have been conducted by an outside nation state, but SolarWinds has not verified the\nidentity of the attacker.\n\nAs our investigation has progressed, and as we’ve worked with CrowdStrike and KPMG, we’ve identified malware known as SUNSPOT, the\nhighly sophisticated and novel code designed to inject the SUNBURST malicious code into the Orion Platform during the build process.\nSUNSPOT is not a new malware or attack, but instead a component of the SUNBURST cyberattack. Read more about SUNSPOT on the\n[CrowdStrike blog here.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/sunspot-malware-technical-analysis/)\n\nWhile SUNSPOT is the means by which the attackers injected the SUNBURST backdoor during the build process of the Orion Platform,\nTEARDROP and RAINDROP are reportedly malware loaders that could be deployed as secondary tools using the SUNBURST backdoor.\nSUNSPOT, TEARDROP, and RAINDROP are NOT new vulnerabilities within our products as some reports in the media have indicated, but\ninstead, they are elements of the SUNBURST attack chain.\n\nThe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) Computer Emergency Readiness Team (CERT), part of the Department of\nHomeland Security (DHS), CERT issued [Emergency Directive 21-01 on December 13, 2020 regarding this issue and has updated their](https://cyber.dhs.gov/ed/21-01/)\nguidance as part of our ongoing coordination with the agency. The latest information can be found on CISA’s [Supply Chain Compromise page](https://www.cisa.gov/supply-chain-compromise)\nand continues to be updated as we learn more.\n\n**We want to assure you we’ve removed the software builds known to be affected by the SUNBURST vulnerability from our download**\n**sites.**\n\nWhile our [investigations are ongoing, based on our investigations to date, we are not aware that this SUNBURST vulnerability affects other](https://orangematter.solarwinds.com/2021/01/11/new-findings-from-our-investigation-of-sunburst/)\nversions of Orion Platform products. Also, while we are still investigating our non-Orion products, we have not seen any evidence that they are\nimpacted by the SUNBURST vulnerability.\n\n[If you aren't sure which version of the Orion Platform you are using, see directions on how to check that here.

As part of our response to the SUNBURST vulnerability, the code-signing certificate used by SolarWinds to sign the affected software\nversions was revoked March 8, 2021. This is industry-standard best practice for software that has been compromised.\n\nWe’ve obtained new digital code-signing certificates and have rebuilt the affected versions, have re-signed our code, and have re-released all\nof the products previously signed with the certificate to be revoked. To ensure the performance of your SolarWinds product(s), you must\nupgrade to these new builds.\n\nIf you’re unable to upgrade at this time, we have provided a script that customers can install to temporarily protect their environment against\n[the SUPERNOVA malware***.

have determined that Orion Platform version 2019.4 unpatched, released in October 2019,**\ncontained test modifications to the code base. While this version is not impacted by the SUNBURST vulnerability, it is the first version in which\nwe have seen activity from the attacker at this time. Subsequent releases 2019.4 HF 1, 2019.4 HF 2, 2019.4 HF 3, and 2019.4 HF 4 did not\ninclude either test modifications contained in the 2019.4 version or the SUNBURST vulnerability contained in 2019.4 HF 5, 2020.2 with no\nhotfix and 2020.2 HF 1.\n\n**[** If you apply a SUPERNOVA security patch per the above chart, please visit this KB article to validate the patch was applied to all Orion](https://support.solarwinds.com/SuccessCenter/s/article/Use-a-script-to-verify-that-the-Supernova-patch-was-applied-to-all-Orion-web-servers?language=en_US)**\nPlatform web servers.
