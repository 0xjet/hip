Especially when time frames are shorts\n and/or budgets are limited.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### PART I: APT MYTHS AND DEFINITIONS\n\n\n\n###### • How to measure an advanced APT?\n\n\n-----\n\n###### PART I: APT MYTHS AND DEFINITIONS\n\n\n\n###### • Public and most known “Middle-East” APT’s, based on public feeds:\n\n • GREENBUG\n\n • OILRIG\n\n • MUDDYWATER\n\n • APT 33\n\n • APT 34\n\n • …..\n\n • Up-to-date Middle-East APT OSINT data can be found here:\n\n • https://darkmatter.ae/evolution-muddywater-advanced-persistent-threat-apt/\n\n\n-----\n\n###### PART I: APT MYTHS AND DEFINITIONS\n\n\n\n###### • Most of them rely on open-source tools:\n\n • Empire, Metasploit, Mimikatz, invoke-obfuscation, PsExec…\n\n • Minor some customization: strings replacements, code refractoring, ..\n\n • Sometimes relying and re-using low commodity malware:\n\n • RATs: NANOCORE, NETWIRE, njRAT, ...\n\n • OR build copy-pasta Android malware, ..\n\n • Usually copy-cat actors, unless some of them developed custom basic hack tools:\n\n • POWERSTATS, ISMAGENT, MICROSPIA, ...\n\n • Then they unlock the glorifying life-time “APT” attribution.\n\n #UnlockyourAPTTag\n\n\n-----\n\n###### PART I: APT MYTHS AND DEFINITIONS\n\n\n\n###### • Example of OilRig custom x64 Mimikatz:\n\n • Original Mimikatz x64 version have 1779 functions in total\n\n • OilRig modified Mimikatz have only 660 functions in total\n\n • Based on mimikatz version 0.1\n\n • Have all the strings changed\n\n\n-----\n\n###### PART I: APT MYTHS AND DEFINITIONS\n • String changes for the OilRIG custom x64 Mimikatz:\n\n\n-----\n\n###### PART I: APT MYTHS AND DEFINITIONS\n • String changes for the OilRIG custom x64 Mimikatz:\n\n\n-----\n\n# II\n\n###### WHY AND HOW WINDSHIFT APT IS DIFFERENT?\n\n\n-----\n\n###### PART II: WHY AND HOW WINDSHIFT IS DIFFERENT?\n\n\n\n###### • It’s a long term non-attributable APT.\n\n • Pure Intelligence and Cyber espionage actor -> mostly active surveillance\n\n • It’s been there for a while, and never got popped.\n\n • Versatile, sophisticated and unpredictable Spear phishing attacks\n\n • They Re-use your favorite APT malware (and Infrastructures):\n\n • aka Hacking other APT actors\n\n • Very rarely directly engage targets with malware :\n\n • 2 attempts in 2017, very specific individuals.\n\n • 3 attempts in 2018, again very specific individuals.\n\n • They are ONLY after specific individuals. Rarely targets corporate environments. This what helped them staying under the radar for years.\n\n\n-----\n\n# III\n\n###### WINDSHIFT APT – MODUS OPERANDI (MO)\n\n\n-----\n\n###### PART III: WINDSHIFT APT – MODUS OPERANDI (MO)\n\n\n\n##### • Phase 1: RECON – phase 1 duration 1-2 years\n\n###### • Via maintained fake personas on different social platforms:\n\n – Linkedin, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Google Plus.\n\n • Sending Friend Requests, engaging a conversation, to get\n identifiable information, emails, phone numbers, friends contacts\n\n • Through social media mobile apps:\n\n – Example of such apps, phonebooks, stealing contact list,\n emails and SMS contents https://darkmatter.ae/darkmatter- identifies-app-stealing-personal-information/\n\n\n-----\n\n###### PART III: WINDSHIFT APT – MODUS OPERANDI (MO)\n\n\n\n##### • Phase 1: RECON – phase 1 duration 1-2 years\n\n###### • Example of fake online persona Asalah (أﺻﺎﻟﺔآل ﺳﻣﯾﺣﺔ) Al Sameeha\n\n linked to WINDSHIFT APT:\n\n\n-----\n\n###### PART III: WINDSHIFT APT – MODUS OPERANDI (MO)\n\n\n\n##### • Twitter OSINT 101:\n\n###### • Legitimate Twitter account vs APT maintained Twitter Account \n (Weekly Activity) – using tweets_analyzer.py tool \n APT maintained Twitter account: @aheemaslahalasa\n\n\n-----\n\n###### PART III: WINDSHIFT APT – MODUS OPERANDI (MO)\n\n\n\n###### • Phase 2: RECON – phase 2 – duration 6 months – 1 year\n\n • Long term monitoring of targets via benign emails:\n\n – Click habits, subjects of interests\n\n – Geo locating targets + Type of computer target uses (via User-Agent)\n\n – Email click rate\n\n – Usage of mailing lists, sending daily emails: duplicating content of local media\n\n • Building a sort of content habit and relationship with the target over time.\n\n => increasing click rates, preparing the targets for the next phases.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### PART III: WINDSHIFT APT – MODUS OPERANDI (MO)\n\n\n\n###### • Phase 2: RECON – phase 2 – duration 6 months – 1 year\n\n – Benign email, example of Khaleej times content duplication, link pointing to legit\n Khaleej times as well:\n\n\n-----\n\n###### PART III: WINDSHIFT APT – MODUS OPERANDI (MO)\n\n\n\n###### • Phase 2: RECON – phase 2 – duration 6 months – 1 year\n\n\n-----\n\n###### PART III: WINDSHIFT APT – MODUS OPERANDI (MO)\n\n\n\n###### • Phase 3: Credential harvesting, duration 1 day\n\n • Sending emails mimicking legit password recovery or password reset of following providers :\n\n – Targeting personal emails : Gmail, Apple iCloud, Etisalat (main ISP in UAE)\n\n – Targeting professional emails: OWA outlook\n\n • Send SMS redirecting to a credential harvesting page.\n\n • Domain typo squatting\n\n • Domains resolves only 1 day during the attack then shutdown.\n\n • Anonymous domains registered with freenom.com for free: .ml, .tk, .ga. gq\n\n • Also domains registered with Internet BS, Namecheap, with Whois Privacy Guard..\n\n • Credential harvesting landing pages are using HTTPS : free SSL certificates with let’s encrypt, or COMODO Free SSL ..\n\n\n-----\n\n###### PART III: WINDSHIFT APT – MODUS OPERANDI (MO)\n\n\n\n###### • Phase 3: Credential harvesting, duration 1 day\n\n • OWA harvesting attempt:\n\n\n-----\n\n###### PART III: WINDSHIFT APT – MODUS OPERANDI (MO)\n\n\n\n###### • Phase 3: Credential harvesting, duration 1 day\n\n • Apple ID harvesting attempt via SMS and Emails :\n\n\n-----\n\n###### PART III: WINDSHIFT APT – MODUS OPERANDI (MO)\n\n\n\n###### • Phase 3: Credential harvesting, duration 1 day\n\n • SMS targeting Etisalat Users:\n\n\n-----\n\n###### PART III: WINDSHIFT APT – MODUS OPERANDI (MO)\n\n\n\n###### • Phase 3: Credential harvesting, duration 1 day\n\n • Gmail harvesting attempt:\n\n\n-----\n\n###### PART III: WINDSHIFT APT – MODUS OPERANDI (MO)\n\n\n\n###### • Phase 4: Hacking targets, 1 or twice per year\n\n • This phase usually happens if Phase 3 was unsuccessful after many attempts.
