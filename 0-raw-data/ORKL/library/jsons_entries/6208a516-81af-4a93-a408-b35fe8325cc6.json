As a matter of fact, cyber-space\nstakeholders have gone through varying degrees of further maturity. While the friendly agents – the good\nguys – have demonstrated increased cooperation and orchestrated reaction to cyber-threats, hostile\nagents – the bad guys – have advanced their malicious tools with obfuscation, stealthiness and striking\npower.\n\nOn the defenders’ side, improvements have been achieved in coordinated campaigns to disturb operations\nof malicious infrastructures, strengthen the legal/governmental cyber-defence framework and develop\nmore efficient products. In particular:\n\n    - Performing orchestrated actions to take down malicious infrastructure but also to analyse incidents\nand improve attribution.\n\n    - Strengthening governmental awareness, cyber-defence expenses, capabilities and level of cooperation\namong states.\n\n    - Performing exercises, development of threat intelligence, proliferation of information sharing, tools\nand products to enhance awareness, preparedness and efficiency of defence.\n\n    - Focusing on research and development to accommodate developments of the cyber-threat landscape\nto existing protection measures and methods and tools.\n\nThese are qualities that have been consistently developed throughout 2015 and have reached a\nmomentum that allows for a persistent course of action.\n\nAdversaries have achieved considerable advances too. No Snowden or Heartbleed-like events have been\nreported. Instead, cyber-threats have undergone significant evolution and just as in 2014, significant\nbreaches have covered front pages of media. And exactly this is an alerting fact: seemingly, cyber-threat\nagents have had the tranquillity and resources to implement a series of advancements in malicious\npractices. In particular:\n\n    - Performing persistent attacks based on hardware, far below the “radar” of available defence tools and\nmethods.\n\n    - Achieving enhancements in the provision of “cyber-crime-as-a-service”, tool developments for nonexperts and affiliate programmes.\n\n    - Highly efficient development of malware weaponization and automated tools to detect and exploit\nvulnerabilities.\n\n    - Campaigning with highly profitable malicious infrastructures and malware to breach data and hold\nend-user devices to ransom.\n\n    - Broadening of the attack surface to include routers, firmware and internet of things.\n\nDetails for all the above-mentioned points can be found in the ENISA Threat Landscape 2015 (ETL 2015).\nTop 15 cyber-threats together with threat trends, trends of threat agents and trends for emerging\ntechnologies have been assessed and presented in this report. This material delivers evidence upon which\nthe consequences for the development of cyber-defences can be based.\n\n\n-----\n\n| January 2016\n\nLessons learned and conclusions summarise our experience from this year’s threat landscape and draw a\nroadmap with aspects that need to be addressed in the future by policy, businesses and research. An\noverview hereof is as follows:\n\n**_Policy conclusions:_**\n\n- Make threat intelligence collection, management and sharing an inherent part of the national cyberdefence capabilities.\n\n- Foster voluntary reporting and perform analysis of reported incidents and recycle results for better\nplanning of defences.\n\n- Disseminate cyber-threat knowledge to all players in cyber-space, including end-users.\n\n**_Business conclusions:_**\n\n- Simplify content of threat intelligence to achieve wider uptake in the stakeholder community.\n\n- Elaborate on threat agent models and make it inherent part of threat intelligence.\n\n- Create correlated, contextualized threat information to increase timespan of relevance.\n\n- Continuously adapt protection and detection tools to the threats.\n\n- Invest in better vulnerability management and exploitation of dark web.\n\n**_Research conclusions:_**\n\n- Develop applied statistic models to increase comparability of cyber-threat and incident information.\n\n- Develop new models for seamlessly operated security controls to be included in complex, smart enduser environments.\n\n- Develop trust models for the ad hoc interoperability of devices within smart environments.\n\nFinally, regarding the overall highlights for the future cyber-threat landscapes, one should mention two\noverarching trends for defenders and adversaries respectively:\n\n- The need for “Streamlining and consolidation” of existing policies, defences and cooperation to\naccommodate changes in threat landscape and\n\n- Ongoing activities towards “Consumerization of cyber-crime”, that is, making malicious tools available\nto everybody.\n\nThe figure below summarizes the top 15 cyber-threats and threat trends in comparison to the threat\nlandscape of 2014.\n\n\n-----\n\n| January 2016\n\n|Assessed Top Threats 2014 Trends 2013|Assessed Top Threats 2015 Trends 2014|Change in ranking|\n|---|---|---|\n|1.

Introduction\n\nThis report, the ENISA Threat Landscape 2015 (ETL 2015), is the result of an analysis of cyber-threats that\nhave been encountered in the last 12 months, that is, approximately between December 2014 and\nDecember 2015. ETL 2015 is the fourth in a series of reports issued yearly by ENISA. It provides an analysis\nof the state and the dynamics of the cyber-threat environment: the Cyber-Threat Landscape.\n\nJust as previous threat landscape reports, ETL 2015 is the result of a comprehensive threat analysis that is\nbased mainly on open source intelligence. The analysis is followed by a collation of threat information. In\nthis process, cyber-incidents, cyber-threats, cyber-attacks, etc. are put in context to by means of correlated\ninformation. This is cyber-threat intelligence that is being created within ENISA: an amount of knowledge\non the development of cyber-threats created on annual basis.\n\nETL 2015 is a significant part of this knowledge captured in the form of a report. It contains top 15 cyberthreats assessed in 2015, together with information on threat agents, attack vectors and threat trends for\na number of emerging technologies. The information presented is accompanied with references to all\nrelevant resources found. Though non-exhaustive, ETL 2015 includes a critical mass of published material\nthat allows to underpin the assumptions made. At the same time, the collected material is a tool to the\nhands of interested individuals who need to deepen in the details of a certain matter presented in this\nreport.\n\nIn the reporting period, material found on cyber-threats has increased quantity, quality and focus. This is\ndue to the continuous improvement achieved in the area of threat intelligence and is a result of the\nincreased demand and efforts invested, both by public and private organisations. In a similar manner as in\nETL 2014, in ETL2015 we have processed ca. 380 resources. This number is rather representative for the\nsearch and analysis effort at ENISA than the available resources worldwide which were apparently much\nhigher.\n\nBesides open source information, in this report ENISA has used information provided by the MISP\nplatform[1], by CERT-EU[2] and by also using threat intelligence of the cyber-security portal CYjAX[3], provided\nby means access pro bono to ENISA. Confidential information found in these platforms has just been taken\ninto account in our analysis without any disclosure or reference to this material.\n\nIn comparison to previous ETLs, some minor changes have been made in the structure of this report. They\nregard the description part of current threats. In particular, for each cyber-threat described we attach a list\nof indicative mitigation controls, referred to as mitigation vector. This was a requirement communicated to\nus by stakeholders. Secondly, in 2015 kill chain information of the top 15 threats has not been adopted as\nit is identical with ETL 2014. To find information hereto, interested readers would need to revisit ETL\n2014[29].\n\nJust as in previous years, ENISA has consulted the ETL Stakeholder group that accompanies the threat\nanalysis work. The group has provided valuable input, has supported the ENISA event on threat analysis\n\n1 [http://www.misp-project.org/, accessed November 2015.](http://www.misp-project.org/)\n2 [https://cert.europa.eu/cert/filteredition/en/CERT-LatestNews.html, accessed November 2015.](https://cert.europa.eu/cert/filteredition/en/CERT-LatestNews.html)\n3 [https://www.cyjax.com/, accessed November 2015.](https://www.cyjax.com/)\n\n\n-----\n\n| January 2016\n\norganised in 2015[4] and has reviewed ENISA material. Their support has definitely contributed to the quality\nof the material presented in this report.\n\n##### Policy context\n\nThe Cyber Security Strategy of the EU[5] underscores the importance of threat analysis and emerging trends\nin cyber security. The ENISA Threat Landscape contributes towards the achievement of objectives\nformulated in this strategy, in particular by contributing to the identification of emerging trends in cyberthreats and understanding the evolution of cyber-crime (see 2.4 regarding proposed role of ENISA).\n\nMoreover, the new ENISA Regulation[6 ]mentions the need to analyse current and emerging risks (and their\ncomponents), stating: “the Agency, in cooperation with Member States and, as appropriate, with statistical\n_bodies and others, collects relevant information”. In particular, under Art. 3, Tasks, d), iii), the new ENISA_\nregulations states that ENISA should “enable effective responses to current and emerging network and\n_information security risks and threats”._\n\nThe ENISA Threat Landscape aims to make a significant contribution to the implementation of the EU\nCyber Security Strategy by streamlining and consolidating available information on cyber-threats and their\nevolution.\n\n##### Target audience\n\nInformation in this report has mainly strategic and tactical relevance[10] to cyber-threats and related\ninformation. Such information has long-term relevance of approximately up to one year. It is directed to\nexecutives, security architects and security managers. Nonetheless, provided information is also easily\nconsumable by non-experts.\n\nLooking at the details provided by this report and ETL in general, one can discriminate among the following\ninformation types and target groups:\n\n   - The method part (see chapter 2) is targeting security professionals who may seek to find out how\nthreat information relates to other topics of information security and information security\nmanagement. Provided information may allow them to deepen in issues of threat intelligence, threat\ninformation collection and threat information analysis and/or find ways in integrating it with other\nsecurity management disciplines.\n\n   - The current threat landscape is a compilation of information about top cyber-threats (see chapter 3).\nAt the level of the threat description, generalists and decision makers can find non-technical\ninformation about the cyber threats. By going through details, issues assessed and sources related to\nthe text, interested individuals and security experts might find detailed technical information.\n\n   - A generic description of cyber-threat agents explains developments in this area (see chapter 4). This\ninformation is good for all readers, decision makers, **security** **experts and non-experts.**\n\n   - The emerging threat landscape contains information for a wide range of skills (see chapter 6). The\nchapter targets mainly security managers and security architects who would like to understand the\n\n4 [https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/events/enisa-workshop-on-eu-threat-landscape,](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/events/enisa-workshop-on-eu-threat-landscape)\n\naccessed November 2015.\n5 [http://www.ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/eu-cybersecurity-plan-protect-open-internet-and-online-freedom-and-](http://www.ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/eu-cybersecurity-plan-protect-open-internet-and-online-freedom-and-opportunity-cyber-security)\n\n[opportunity-cyber-security, accessed November 2015.](http://www.ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/eu-cybersecurity-plan-protect-open-internet-and-online-freedom-and-opportunity-cyber-security)\n6 [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2013:165:0041:0058:EN:PDF, accessed November 2015.](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2013:165:0041:0058:EN:PDF)\n\n\n-----\n\n| January 2016\n\ntrends ahead. The information provided is also potentially useful for decision makers as decision\nsupport information.\n\nBesides these roles in the ETL target group, details provided on methodology, threats, issues, threat\nagents, attack vectors and trends are useful for risk manager. This kind of information is essential input to\nany risk assessment process.\n\nBesides the information in this report, there are “side products” that might be interesting for a wide\naudience. On the occasion of the ENISA High Level Event[7], ENISA has produced a leaflet with a\nconsolidated high level description of issues that resulted this year’s threat assessment[8]. This material\ntargets decision makers from both policy and business.\n\nAnother product of the ETL process is the ENISA threat taxonomy, a hierarchy of threats used as a point of\nreference to classify collected and processed information about threats and in particular cyber-threats[26].\nFinally, in 2015 ENISA has produced two detailed threat assessments in two sectors. These the thematic\n_landscapes have been issued for Big Data[362] and Software Defined Networks / 5G[320] and are published as_\nseparate reports.\n\n##### Structure of the document\n\nThe structure of ETL 2015 is as follows:\n\nChapter 2 “Purpose, Scope and Method” provides some information regarding the threat analysis process\nas it is being performed within the ETL2015. Moreover, it refers to the information structures as used\nwithin our threat analysis and provides some information on used definitions.\n\nChapter 3 “Top Cyber-Threats: The Current Threat Landscape” is the heart of the ETL 2014 as it contains\ntop 15 cyber-threats assessed in 2015. It provides detailed information on the threat with references to all\nrelevant resources found, trends assessed and mitigation vectors for each threat.\n\nChapter 4 “Threat Agents” is an overview of threat agents with short profiles and references to\ndevelopments that have been observed for every threat agent group in the reporting period.\n\nChapter 5 “Attack Vectors” provides information on typical attack scenarios, steps and deployed cyberthreats and is supposed to complement the presented material by giving some initial information on the\n“How” of a cyber-attack.\n\nChapter 6 “The Emerging Threat Landscape” indicates assessed technology areas that will impact the\nthreat landscapes in the middle-term. Ongoing developments in those areas will influence the ways\nattackers will try to achieve their aims, but also the way defences are going to be implemented.\n\nChapter 7 “Food for thought: Lessons Learned and Conclusions” is a summary of interesting issues\nencountered within the threat analysis and provides the conclusions of this year’s ETL.\n\n7 [https://www.enisa.europa.eu/events/enisa-events/enisa-high-level-event-2015, accessed November 2015.](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/events/enisa-events/enisa-high-level-event-2015)\n8 [https://www.enisa.europa.eu/events/enisa-events/enisa-high-level-event-2015/cyber-7-seven-messages-to-the-](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/events/enisa-events/enisa-high-level-event-2015/cyber-7-seven-messages-to-the-edge-of-cyber-space)\n\n[edge-of-cyber-space, accessed November 2015.](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/events/enisa-events/enisa-high-level-event-2015/cyber-7-seven-messages-to-the-edge-of-cyber-space)\n\n\n-----\n\n| January 2016\n\n### 2. Purpose, Scope and Method\n\nIn 2015, threat analysis and threat intelligence have gone through an impressive breakthrough, whereas\nthe details of various aspects, phases and purposes/use cases have been analysed and documented. This\nhas been done by means of various reports issued by various states[9], organisations[10] and vendors[11,12,13,14]\n(references are indicative due to the large number of related material). Threat intelligence in general has\nbeen considered as one of the key technologies in cyber-security[15]. These facts underline the importance\nof threat intelligence and in particular threat analysis in the context of management of cyber-security\nincidents. Following this trend, many services, products and practices have entered the market. Threat\nintelligence services in various degrees of “width and depth” have shown up.\n\nThough quite massively deployed, threat intelligence is still a new area and as such, products and market\nare at an early maturity stage: both vendors and customers do not have common perceptions on the topic\nand how it can be integrated as service or product into the daily businesses. Moreover, there is a “spread”\nin existing offerings with regard to the kind of delivered information and protection offered on the one\nhand and on the other hand the customer prerequisites (e.g. technical and organisational). Nonetheless,\npredictions foresee a great potential for the threat intelligence market, reaching some 5 billion $ in 2020[16].\n\nResearch and development in the area of threat intelligence advances too. In the reporting period we have\nassessed the initiation of important programmes in the area of threat intelligence[17,18] and dynamic risk\nmanagement[19] both in Europe and US.\n\nWhile research and vendors are working on the state-of-the-art in the area of threat intelligence/threat\nanalysis, ENISA has undertaken next steps for the improvement of methods used. This effort has ran in\nparallel to the information collection and analysis tasks and aimed at the development of available\npractices. In particular, ENISA efforts have been concentrated in the following areas:\n\n    - _Identification of the data structures used in the threat analysis process and threat landscaping: A data_\nmodel of the information household of the entire process of collection, analysis and description of\ncyber-threats, both for ETL and ENISA Thematic Landscapes has been developed.\n\n    - _Creation of a threat taxonomy: Through the information collection and analysis activities of the_\nprevious years at ENISA, a threat taxonomy has evolved. This taxonomy is a multi-tool that can be used\n\n9 [https://securityintelligence.com/us-government-to-establish-cyber-threat-intelligence-integration-center/, accessed](https://securityintelligence.com/us-government-to-establish-cyber-threat-intelligence-integration-center/)\n\nNovember 2015.\n10 [https://www.cpni.gov.uk/documents/publications/2015/23-march-2015-mwr_threat_intelligence_whitepaper-](https://www.cpni.gov.uk/documents/publications/2015/23-march-2015-mwr_threat_intelligence_whitepaper-2015.pdf?epslanguage=en-gb)\n\n[2015.pdf?epslanguage=en-gb, accessed November 2015.](https://www.cpni.gov.uk/documents/publications/2015/23-march-2015-mwr_threat_intelligence_whitepaper-2015.pdf?epslanguage=en-gb)\n11 [http://digitalshadows.com/threat-intelligence-a-buyers-guide-/, accessed November 2015.](http://digitalshadows.com/threat-intelligence-a-buyers-guide-/)\n12 [http://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/EY-cyber-threat-intelligence-how-to-get-ahead-of-](http://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/EY-cyber-threat-intelligence-how-to-get-ahead-of-cybercrime/$FILE/EY-cyber-threat-intelligence-how-to-get-ahead-of-cybercrime.pdf)\n\n[cybercrime/$FILE/EY-cyber-threat-intelligence-how-to-get-ahead-of-cybercrime.pdf, accessed November 2015.](http://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/EY-cyber-threat-intelligence-how-to-get-ahead-of-cybercrime/$FILE/EY-cyber-threat-intelligence-how-to-get-ahead-of-cybercrime.pdf)\n13 [http://threatintelligencetimes.com/about-us/, accessed November 2015.](http://threatintelligencetimes.com/about-us/)\n14 [http://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/threat-intelligence-center/, accessed November 2015.](http://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/threat-intelligence-center/)\n15 [http://darkmatters.norsecorp.com/2015/02/25/cisos-threat-intelligence-big-data-analytics-and-encryption-are-](http://darkmatters.norsecorp.com/2015/02/25/cisos-threat-intelligence-big-data-analytics-and-encryption-are-key-technologies/)\n\n[key-technologies/, accessed November 2015.](http://darkmatters.norsecorp.com/2015/02/25/cisos-threat-intelligence-big-data-analytics-and-encryption-are-key-technologies/)\n16 [http://www.marketsandmarkets.com/PressReleases/threat-intelligence-security.asp, accessed November 2015.](http://www.marketsandmarkets.com/PressReleases/threat-intelligence-security.asp)\n17 [https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/events/cf/ictpd14/item-display.cfm?id=12676, accessed November 2015.](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/events/cf/ictpd14/item-display.cfm?id=12676)\n18 [http://www.gtri.gatech.edu/ctisl, accessed November 2015.](http://www.gtri.gatech.edu/ctisl)\n19 [http://www.mitigateproject.eu/, accessed November 2015.](http://www.mitigateproject.eu/)\n\n\n-----\n\n| January 2016\n\nin all phases of threat analysis. The development of a threat taxonomy has been a requirement\ncommunicated to ENISA in 2014 and it will be continued in 2016.\n\n  - _Initial identification of graphical support for the presentation of cyber-threat information: Graphical_\nelements for the representation of cyber-threats are an important issue that is currently addressed by\nmarket players in the threat analysis[20,21,22]. In 2015, ENISA carried out an initial assessment of graphical\nsupport for ETL.\n\nResults achieved in these areas will be briefly discussed in the forthcoming chapters. This information\nmight help readers to better understand the scope of ENISA’s work, while at the same time providing\ninformation about the ENISA method. Information about the method may help interested parties in\nintroducing threat analysis in their organisations. Such information may be used in multiple ways, such as;\nbeing the basis for requirements analysis; used for the evaluation of tools; used for the evaluation of\nservices; taken as good practice for adjustments of own practices, etc.\n\n##### Data structures used in the threat analysis process and threat landscaping\n\nThe information used within ENISA for threat landscaping has been identified in 2015 and has been\nrepresented by means of a data model. This is an initial step in order to create a data household of the\nentire information managed within the ENISA work, both regarding ETL but also the Thematic Landscapes,\ni.e. detailed threat landscapes in selected areas/technologies.\n\nAlthough some of the data concerned have been created and maintained as distinct entities in the past,\nthe entire ETL model has not been described as a whole. Yet, the identified ETL data model is\ncomprehensive and covers all information, from the collection to the final documentation. The data model\nin its current form has been created in 2015 in an ex-post manner and is presented in the figure below (see\nFigure 1). It is worth mentioning that the blue under laid area covers the data used in ETL, while the yellow\none stands for the data household of the thematic landscapes.\n\n20 [http://cybermap.kaspersky.com/, accessed November 2015.](http://cybermap.kaspersky.com/)\n21 [https://www.fireeye.com/cyber-map/threat-map.html, accessed November 2015.](https://www.fireeye.com/cyber-map/threat-map.html)\n22 [http://map.ipviking.com/?_ga=1.98376799.153405815.1403529861#, accessed November 2015.](http://map.ipviking.com/?_ga=1.98376799.153405815.1403529861)\n\n\n-----\n\n| January 2016\n\n**Attributes Current Threats:**\n\n                                             - **Description of threat**\n\n                                             - **Issues related to threat** **Attributes Emerging Technology Area:**\n\n                                             - **Overall trend**                                              - **Relevance of Emerging Area**\n\n                                             - **Threat Agents**                                              - **Possible Vulnerabilities/Weaknesses**\n\n                                             - **Related threats**                                              - **Top 10 threats (from current)**\n\n                                             - **Position in kill chain**                                              - **Foreseen Trend**\n\n                                                                      - **Threat Agents**\n\n**Thematic Landscape**\n\n                                                                      - **Issues related to threat/area**\n\n                                                                      - **References**\n\n**_Attributes-Collection:_**\n\n          - **Threat classification**\n\n          - **Affected Asset Type** **Attributes Threat Agents:**\n\n          - **Affected Business Sector**           - **Description**\n\n          - **Emerging technology area**          - **Motives**\n\n          - **Threat Agents**           - **Capabilities**\n\n          - **Relevant Reference**           - **References**\n\n          - **Trend**\n\n          - **Relevant URL**\n\n**ENISA Threat Landscape**\n\n**Attributes Sector:**\n\n                                              - **Asset Inventory**\n\n                                              - **Relevant Threats**\n\n                                              - **Possible Vulnerabilities/Weaknesses**\n\n                                              - **Assessed particular sector threats (from incidents)**\n\n                                              - **Threat Agents**\n\n                                              - **Threat mitigation practices/controls**\n\n                                             - **References**\n\n**Figure 1: Data model covering all information managed within all phases of ETL**\n\nKnowing maintained data structures has manifold purposes: i) it clarifies the context and the\ninterdependencies of used information, ii) it helps in defining storage structures of the information (e.g.\ntables/relations), iii) it clarifies data structures that can be imported / exported and iv) it helps in\nunderstanding how own data correspond to other approaches. All these four steps are essential in advancing\nthe maturity of the used approach.\n\nIn order to assess level of “coverage” between this data model and STIX[23] - a data format that is being\nwidely used for threat information - we have made a comparison at the level of data models. The detailed\ncomparison can be found in Annex A: With this information at hand, the interfaces between ENISA’s data\nand data from other threat intelligence sources can be defined (i.e. input/output data).\n\nFinally, regarding the quality of produced cyber-threat information, it has to be underlined that the ETL is\ngeared more towards strategic threat intelligence with some tactical parts, while thematic landscapes\ncontain more tactical information. An excellent report describing role and scope of threat information is\n10.In short, strategic and tactical threat information as follows[24]:\n\n- _Strategic information is used within forecasts of the threat landscape and emerging technological_\ntrends in order to prepare organisations by means of assessments, prospective measures and security\n\n23 [https://stixproject.github.io/, accessed November 2015.](https://stixproject.github.io/)\n24 [https://www.first.org/resources/papers/conf2015/first_2015_marinos-louis-enisa-threat-landscape_20150630.pdf,](https://www.first.org/resources/papers/conf2015/first_2015_marinos-louis-enisa-threat-landscape_20150630.pdf)\n\naccessed November 2015.\n\n\n-----\n\n| January 2016\n\ninvestments, as well as adaptation of existing cyber security strategies. It is created and consumed by\nhumans and has a life span of some months (ca. one year).\n\n  - _Tactical information consists of condensed information describing threats and their components, such_\nas threat agents, threat trends, emerging trends for various technological areas, risks to various assets,\nrisk mitigation practices, etc. This information is important for stakeholders engaged in maintenance of\nsecurity controls. It is created by humans and machines and has a life span of weeks/months.\n\n##### Threat taxonomy\n\nThreat taxonomy is a classification of threats. The purpose of such a taxonomy is to establish a point of\nreference for threats encountered, while providing a possibility to shuffle, arrange and detail threat\ndefinitions. To this extend, a threat taxonomy is a living structure that is being used to maintain a\nconsistent view on threats on the basis of collected information.\n\nThe current version of ENISA Threat Taxonomy (ETT) has been developed over the past years as an internal\ntool used in the collection and consolidation of threat information. When collecting information on various\nthreats, it is very convenient to store similar things together. To this extend, a threat taxonomy has been\ngenerated. It is worth mentioning that the initial structure has been updated/consolidated with various\nsources of threat information. Most of threat information included was from existing threat catalogues the\narea of information security and in particular risk management. An overview of consolidated threat\ncatalogues can be found here[25]. Hence, besides cyber-threats the ENISA threat taxonomy (ETT) contains\nalso physical threats that can cause harm to information technology assets.\n\nAs until now the ETT has been used for collection and consolidation of cyber-threat information, only the\ncyber-threat part of the taxonomy has been maintained and developed further. Although all information\nsecurity threat areas are part of the ETT, those that are not related to cyber have not evolved over the\ntime.\n\nIn 2015, ENISA has created a consolidated version of these threats, has added some short descriptions to\nthese threats and has decided to make this material publicly available as a spread sheet[26]. The figure below\nshows this taxonomy in form of a mind map, together with some symbols indicating its possible use-cases\n(see Figure 2).\n\n25 [http://opensecurityarchitecture.org/cms/images/OSA_images/TC_Comparison.pdf, accessed November 2015.](http://opensecurityarchitecture.org/cms/images/OSA_images/TC_Comparison.pdf)\n[26 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-landscape/etl2015/enisa-threat-taxonomy-a-tool-for-structuring-threat-information)\n\n[landscape/etl2015/enisa-threat-taxonomy-a-tool-for-structuring-threat-information, accessed January 2016.](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-landscape/etl2015/enisa-threat-taxonomy-a-tool-for-structuring-threat-information)\n\n\n-----\n\n| January 2016\n\nViolation of laws or regulations/\n\nbreach of legislation **Physical** Information leakage or sharing\n\ndomains seizure No-IP Microsoft Judiciary decision/court order **Legal** **attacks** Erroneous use or administration\n\nAmplification/ReflectionSpoofing Volume Failure to meet contractual requirementsIdentity fraud **Unintentional damages (accidental)** of devices and systemsUsing information from an unreliable sourceUnintentional change of data in an information system Inadequate specificationsInadequate usabilityInsecure interfaces (APIs)\n\nFlooding Unsolicited & infected e-mailDenial of service Inadequate design and planning or lack of adaption Policy/procedure flaws\n\nPing of Death Application Malicious code/software Design errors\n\nWinNuke activity\n\n###### Collecting XDoS SSL CA Abuse of information leakage EarthquakesFloods Asset exposure\n\nDiginotar infiltration Generation and use of rogue Landslides\n\ncertificates Tsunamis\n\nspoofingDNS Routing table manipulation Manipulation of hardware & software Lightning strikeHeavy rains\n\npoisoninghijackingDNS AS DNS manipulationAS manipulationFalsification of configuration Manipulation of informationFalsification of recordsMisuse of audit toolsUnauthorised use of **Disasters** Natural disasters Heavy snowfallsHeavy windsWildfireElectromagnetic storm\n\nadministration of devices & Fires\n\nDNS Registrar IMPI ProtocolHijacking information system/networkUnauthorised access to systems **Nefarious Activity/Abuse** Environmental disasters Dangerours radiation leaksPollutionDust\n\nUnauthorised use of software Corrosions\n\nUnauthorised installation of Unfavourable climatic conditions\n\nsoftware\n\nCompromising confidential Major events in the environment\n\ninformation Explosions\n\nAbuse of authorizations\n\nWormVirus Abuse of personal data Damage caused by a third External case\n\nTrojan Hoax **Threats** party Internal case\n\nRootkit Badware Loss from DMR conflicts\n\nBotnets Remote activity (execution) Loss of (integrity of) sensitive\n\nScarewareSpyware Targeted attacks (including ATP) **Damage/Loss (IT Assets)** informationLoss or destruction of devices, storage media and documents\n\nRogueware\n\nAdware War driving Loss of information in the cloud\n\nGreyware compromising Interception Information leakage\n\nemissions\n\nNation state Corporate espionage Espionage Interfering radiationsInterception of information **Eavesdropping/Interception/** Failures of parts of devices LinecardsConnectorsNetwork devices\n\nespionage Software interceptionRogue hardware reconnaissance and messagesReplay of Network **Hijacking** Failures of devices or systemsFailures or disruptions of communication links (communication networks) ServersData centersCable break\n\n###### Sorting Lack of network Lack of human resourcescapacity information gatheringMan in the middle/session hijackingRepudiation of Lack of resources/actionselectricity Failures/Malfunctions Failures or disruptions of main supplyFailures of disruptions of service providers (supply chain)Failures or disruptions of the power supply Network devicesServersCable cutPowerCoolingWater Vulnerability\n\nLack of processing Internet outage Malfunctions of devices or systems Data centers\n\n###### Consolidating Lack of storage power Loss of support services Outages Malfunctions of parts of devices Linecards exploitation\n\ncapacity Failures of hardware Connectors\n\nCoolingPowerWater Lack of physical resources Absense of personnelNetwork outageStrike Software bugsConfiguration errors Misconfiguration\n\n**Figure 2: ENISA Threat Taxonomy and its use-cases**\n\nIn short, the indicated use-cases for the threat taxonomy are:\n\n- _Collection: When information is being collected, findings can be grouped around a certain cyber-_\nthreat, although this is often not clearly mentioned in the source text. In the collection phase is as a\nplace to associate various findings under a common threat, putting thus information in context.\n\n- _Sorting/Consolidation: When sufficient information has been collected about a cyber-threat, a_\nconsolidated view about the state-of-play may be generated. This information might include trends,\nstatistics and references. It is then subject to further grouping and prioritization (i.e. in form of one of\nthe top 15 cyber-threats, possibly containing a number of detailed threats).\n\n- _Asset exposure: The threats of the taxonomy may be assigned to assets. This is being done in order to_\nexpress the exposure of an asset to threats. Usually, threats explore weaknesses/vulnerabilities of\nassets to materialise. Hence, vulnerabilities/weaknesses may also be assigned to threats exploring\nthem, either directly or indirectly through the assets.\n\n\n-----\n\n| January 2016\n\nThe current version of ETT has been published as a separate deliverable this year[26]. Its development will be\ncontinued in 2016.\n\n##### Graphical support\n\nGraphical support of threat landscapes, threat information and threat intelligence is an area that has very\nlarge potential. In the reporting period we have seen various approaches to visualization of threats, as\nvendors try to provide more user-friendly access/navigation options to threat information. Besides\nvisualisations of threats by means of web-applications[20,21,22], we have seen interesting interactive graphical\napproaches appearing on online versions of threat reports[27] that certainly provide a better\nreadability/animation to the content of threat reports.\n\nThough no extensive assessment has been done regarding available visualization approaches of threat\nintelligence tools/portals/information services, it seems that there is a general trend towards visualization\nof threat intelligence.\n\nAn interesting approach to the visualization of security and threat intelligence based on open source\nintelligence is Sinfonier[61]. Being developed for security intelligence, this approach provides graphical\nelements and mechanisms for collection, analysis and sharing of related information[28]. As such, it seems as\nparticularly appropriate for threat information.\n\nIn 2015, ENISA has made some prototyping with graphical representation of strategic and tactical threat\ninformation. The prototype was based on graph database Neo4j and its basic visual user interface (neo4jcontrib/neoclipse). This effort will be continued in 2016 with the objective to visualize ETL information,\nwhereas other technical options for the run-time environment will also be investigated.\n\n##### Used definitions\n\nThe definitions used are identical to the ones of ETL 2014[32]. In order to visualize the relationships among\nall elements of risks, we use a figure taken from ISO 15408:2005 (see Figure 3). This figure has a level of\ngranularity that is sufficient to illustrate the main elements of threat and risk mentioned in this report. The\nentities “Owner”, “Countermeasures”, “Vulnerabilities”, “Risks” and partially “Assets” are not taken into\naccount in the ETL. They appear in the figure in order to show their context with regard to threats. The\nnotion of attack vector is being displayed in this figure and is covered in the present report (see chapter 5).\n\nOne should note that the entities threat agent and threat presented in Figure 3 are further detailed\nthrough the ETL data model presented in Figure 1 above. This is quite natural as these entities make up the\nkernel of ETL.\n\nAs regards risks, we adopt the definition according to the widely accepted standard ISO 27005: “Threats\n_abuse vulnerabilities of assets to generate harm for the organisation”. In more detailed terms, we consider_\nrisk as being composed of the following elements:\n\n27 [http://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/research-and-analysis/threat-reports/roundup, accessed November](http://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/research-and-analysis/threat-reports/roundup)\n\n2015.\n28 http://www.slideshare.net/rootedcon/sinfonier\n[003?ref=https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.slideshare.net%2Fslideshow%2](http://www.slideshare.net/rootedcon/sinfonier-003?ref=https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.slideshare.net%2Fslideshow%2Fembed_code%2F33910506&src_secure=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.slideshare.net%2Frootedcon%2Fsinfonier-003&image=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.slidesharecdn.com%2Fss_thumbnails%2Fsinfonier003-140424134953-phpapp01-thumbnail-4.jpg%3Fcb%3D1398366729&key=b7276e97d3f840f38fbdb95eb1242b10&type=text%2Fhtml&schema=slideshare)\n[Fembed_code%2F33910506&src_secure=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.slideshare.net%2Frootedcon%2Fsinfonier-](http://www.slideshare.net/rootedcon/sinfonier-003?ref=https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.slideshare.net%2Fslideshow%2Fembed_code%2F33910506&src_secure=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.slideshare.net%2Frootedcon%2Fsinfonier-003&image=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.slidesharecdn.com%2Fss_thumbnails%2Fsinfonier003-140424134953-phpapp01-thumbnail-4.jpg%3Fcb%3D1398366729&key=b7276e97d3f840f38fbdb95eb1242b10&type=text%2Fhtml&schema=slideshare)\n[003&image=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.slidesharecdn.com%2Fss_thumbnails%2Fsinfonier003-140424134953-phpapp01-](http://www.slideshare.net/rootedcon/sinfonier-003?ref=https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.slideshare.net%2Fslideshow%2Fembed_code%2F33910506&src_secure=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.slideshare.net%2Frootedcon%2Fsinfonier-003&image=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.slidesharecdn.com%2Fss_thumbnails%2Fsinfonier003-140424134953-phpapp01-thumbnail-4.jpg%3Fcb%3D1398366729&key=b7276e97d3f840f38fbdb95eb1242b10&type=text%2Fhtml&schema=slideshare)\nthumbnail[4.jpg%3Fcb%3D1398366729&key=b7276e97d3f840f38fbdb95eb1242b10&type=text%2Fhtml&schema=slideshare,](http://www.slideshare.net/rootedcon/sinfonier-003?ref=https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.slideshare.net%2Fslideshow%2Fembed_code%2F33910506&src_secure=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.slideshare.net%2Frootedcon%2Fsinfonier-003&image=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.slidesharecdn.com%2Fss_thumbnails%2Fsinfonier003-140424134953-phpapp01-thumbnail-4.jpg%3Fcb%3D1398366729&key=b7276e97d3f840f38fbdb95eb1242b10&type=text%2Fhtml&schema=slideshare)\naccessed November 2015.\n\n\n-----\n\n| January 2016\n\n**Asset (Vulnerabilities, Controls), Threat (Threat Agent Profile, Likelihood) and Impact.**\n\nvalue\n\n**Owners** wish to minimise\n\nreduce\nimpose\n\n**Countermeasures**\n\nthat may that may\nbe reduced by possess\nmay be aware of\n\n**Vulnerabilities**\n\nleading to\n\nbased on (set of)\n\n**Attack Vectors** that exploit **Risks**\n\nuse to\n\nthat increase\n\ngive rise to\n\n**Threat agents** **Threats** to **Assets**\n\nwish to abuse and/or may damage\n\n**Figure 3: the elements of a risk and their relationships according to ISO 15408:2005**\n\n\n-----\n\n| January 2016\n\n### 3. Top Cyber-Threats: The Current Threat Landscape\n\n##### Content and purpose of this chapter\n\nIn this chapter the current threat landscape 2015 is presented. It consists of fifteen top cyber-threats,\nassessed during information collection and analysis activities. The current threat landscape covers\ninformation material that has been made publicly available in the time period November 2014 to\nNovember 2015. This time window is referred to as reporting period in the present report. For the sake of\nclarity, it should be noted that the sources analysed in this chapter are the ones detected via the ENISA\nopen source intelligence gathering process. While non-exhaustive[29], they are considered as representative\nof the threats and incidents encountered during this period.\n\nFollowing the trend of previous years, the material found online has increased. In the reporting period,\nnumerous focused publications in important cyber-threats have been found. Examples are: insider threat,\ndenial of service, data breaches and identity theft. At the same time, our team won the impression that\nthe area of mobile computing had shown some stagnation regarding the level of coverage; some reports\nconclude that (fortunately) the mobile vector has not met expectations of cyber-security experts and did\nnot seem to be preferred attack vector to breach user data[85] regarding growth potential. Instead, the\nattention of cyber-security experts has been drawn on incidents in the area of Internet of Things[137] and\nattacks at cyber-physical interfaces[30]. These are definitely upcoming areas of concern for the cybersecurity community.\n\nIn this reporting period the cyber-security community has developed a better focus on particular areas of\ncyber-threats. Moreover, cyber-threat information and intelligence appears to become commonly\nmaintained knowledge, especially at the level of cyber-threat information collection and dissemination\norganisations, such as CERTS (e.g. CERT-EU[31]). This increase in focus and maturity is very beneficial for all\nparties in the assessment of cyber-threats. Following this maturity, we have seen dedicated products for\nthe mitigation of the assessed cyber-threats to start appearing in the market, such as web application\nfirewalls[65].\n\nIt is indeed very fortunate to see threat analysis and assessment efforts converging with product\ndevelopment, thus leading to a robust, demand-driven market. This is one of the most interesting and\npositive observations in the reporting period: efforts invested in cyber-threat analysis and cyber-threat\nintelligence have led to interesting, well-shaped service and product offerings in the cyber-security market.\nThis is a shift from vendor-driven market to a demand-driven one. It remains to be seen how the market\nwill further evolve and how it will accommodate dynamics of the cyber-threat landscape.\n\nAs was the case in previous versions of the ETL, the threat prioritisation has been performed mainly by\nmeans of a combination of frequency of appearance/reference and number of incidents (i.e. “efficiency” of\nthe threat). In some cases, for example, threats that were decreasing ranked higher or kept their position.\nThis means that a higher efficiency of attacks based on this threat has been reported (e.g. botnets). In the\n\n29 Due to the vast amount of published threat information and the limited resources available, it is very likely that\n\nseveral publications on the topic of cyber-threats escaped our attention. Hence, if readers miss some publications\nknown to them, these might be items that have not been spotted during information collection. Despite potentially\nundetected reports, we believe that the collected material is a sufficient sample to identify cyber-threat dynamics\nand trends.\n30 [https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/cyberphysical-systems-0, accessed November 2015.](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/cyberphysical-systems-0)\n31 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1yhQgx2aN8, accessed November 2015.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1yhQgx2aN8)\n\n\n-----\n\n| January 2016\n\nreporting period we have seen some reports classifying incidents according to impact and sector[92]. This is a\nvery useful classification that should be used by more vendors, as it covers aspects of incidents that are\nimportant for decision making within various sectors (i.e. caused costs and consequences).\n\nThe ETL 2015 has been developed without any particular business or infrastructure scenario in mind. As\nsuch, when used within a particular business environment, it is necessary to put ETL information in the\ncontext of that business area. Usually, this should be done by assessing the importance of business, as well\nas human and IT assets of the organisation. Based on this information, a risk assessment will provide\nevidence for the threat exposure of the assets at stake, hence allowing for a prioritization of the threats\naccording to the environment of that business area. The cyber-threats discussed below serve as input to\nsuch a prioritisation.\n\nThe description of cyber threats consists of i) a short text explaining the whereabouts of the threat, ii) a list\nof findings, iii) the trend observed in the reporting period, iv) other related threats that are used in\ncombination with a threat, and v) a list of authoritative resources. In an attempt to keep the size of this\nreport moderate, in this year’s report the kill-chain information of each threat has not being included. It is\nidentical to the previous year’s ETL[32]. Instead, in this year’s ETL, the description of each cyber-threat is\nfollowed by a short, indicative list of mitigation options. This list comprises an initial collection of controls,\nwhose implementation would mitigate the threat, that is, reduce the exposure to the threat. This addition\nhas been done after requirements communicated to ENISA by the reader community of ETL. In future ETL\nversions this type of information might be more extensive.\n\nThis chapter is concluded by a visualized comparison between the current threat landscapes of the ETL\n2014 and the ETL 2015. This will help readers to easily understand the changes of the current threat\nlandscape in this time period.\n\n##### Malware\n\nIn the reporting period malware remains number one cyber-threat. In 2015 current advances in\nsophisticated malware show their potential: Equation Group uses hardware re-programming allowing for\ninstallation of malicious information (e.g. URLs to malware droppers) in the firmware of hard discs[33,34]. This\ninfection method is difficult to detect and disinfect, as it resists hard disc formatting and operating system\nre-installation. Hardware that has been infected with this method may need to be entirely replaced, if used\nfor sensitive tasks (e.g. governments). Albeit mobile malware may not have reached expected levels of\ngrowth, it continues being a serious concern. Total number of mobile malware grew 17% in Q2 2015,\nexceeding 8 million samples, while in 2015, the growth of new mobile malware samples was about 50%\nmore than in previous year[35]. It is interesting that in the area of mobile malware, sharing methods are\ntopped by manual sharing, followed by fake offerings and fake “Likes” that lead to malicious URLs (i.e.\ndroppers)[36]. The Android platform holds the lion’s share with over 95% of mobile malware.

In the reporting period we have\nseen the revival of infection techniques employed almost 20 years ago: Microsoft Office documents\ninfected with Visual Basic macros[38,39] and subsequently downloading malware. This method stands for\nthe other extreme to highly sophisticated attacks encountered in 2015, such as Equation Group and\nDuku 2[40], allegedly emanating from high capability threat agents.\n\n- It is interesting that CONFICKER, a more than 7 years old work still leads the PC infection statistics (37%\nof infections according to[41]). This is another impressive evidence that adversaries maintain “old good”\nmethods as far as they continue paying back. The second most popular malware (Kilim) is based on\nsocial media misuse. This is an evidence for increasing use of social media as one of the main sources\nto lure users.\n\n- Use of malicious URLs showed a sharp increase, compared to malicious e-mail attachments. This is due\nto the shift of infection tactics by using social engineering methods to craft spam/phishing attacks[42].\nInterestingly, rate of malware transporting e-mails has been reduced.\n\n- It is worth mentioning that the observed drop in mobile malware families is an indication that level of\ninnovation slows down, and/or that existing families provide a good basis for abuse of available\ndevices – including mobile Internet of Things devices[43]. Apparently, existing malware families suffice to\ncreate a significant growth of this threat.\n\n- Malware continues increasing by ca. one million new samples per day. The total increase of malware\nsamples till Q2 is 12%[35]. By the end of 2014, total number of available malware samples was estimated\nby 1.7 billion. Consequently, by the time of publication of this report, the overall number of malware\nwould reach the 2 billion threshold.\n\n- Current malware statistics provide the following information[44]:\n\n   - Top 5 countries in which IT resources are infected by malware are: Bangladesh and Vietnam with ca.\n\n60%, followed by Pakistan, Mongolia and Georgia with ca. 58% each.\n\n   - Top countries hosting online malware resources are: Russia ca. 50%, US ca. 12%, The Netherlands ca.\n\n8%, Germany ca. 5% and France ca. 3%.\n\n37 [http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/41714/cyber-crime/govrat-platform.html, accessed November 2015.](http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/41714/cyber-crime/govrat-platform.html)\n38 [http://betanews.com/2015/03/06/down-but-not-out-vba-malware-makes-a-comeback-in-microsoft-office/,](http://betanews.com/2015/03/06/down-but-not-out-vba-malware-makes-a-comeback-in-microsoft-office/)\n\naccessed September 2015.\n39 [http://www.pandasecurity.com/mediacenter/src/uploads/2014/07/Pandalabs-2015-Q2-EN.pdf, accessed](http://www.pandasecurity.com/mediacenter/src/uploads/2014/07/Pandalabs-2015-Q2-EN.pdf)\n\nSeptember 2015.\n[40https://securelist.com/files/2015/06/The_Mystery_of_Duqu_2_0_a_sophisticated_cyberespionage_actor_returns.](https://securelist.com/files/2015/06/The_Mystery_of_Duqu_2_0_a_sophisticated_cyberespionage_actor_returns.pdf)\n\npdf, accessed September 2015.\n41 [https://www.f-secure.com/documents/996508/1030743/Threat_Report_H2_2014, accessed September 2015.](https://www.f-secure.com/documents/996508/1030743/Threat_Report_H2_2014)\n42 [http://www.cert.pl/PDF/Report_CP_2014.pdf, accessed September 2015.](http://www.cert.pl/PDF/Report_CP_2014.pdf)\n43 [http://www.symantec.com/security_response/publications/threatreport.jsp, accessed September 2015.](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/publications/threatreport.jsp)\n44 [https://securelist.com/analysis/quarterly-malware-reports/71610/it-threat-evolution-q2-2015/, accessed](https://securelist.com/analysis/quarterly-malware-reports/71610/it-threat-evolution-q2-2015/)\n\nSeptember 2015.\n\n\n-----\n\n| January 2016\n\n   - Top countries with the risk of online infection are: Russia ca. 39%, Kazakhstan ca. 37%, Ukraine ca.\n\n35%, Syria ca. 24% and Belarus ca. 33%. It is interesting that the majority of those countries suffer\nsome kind of crisis (political/military).\n\n- Malware types detected in the reporting period are topped by potentially unwanted software (aka\nRiskTool) with ca. 44 %, followed by AdWare with ca. 19%, Trojan at ca. 12%, Trojan.SMS 8% and\nTrojan.Spy 7%. Followed by Backdoor, Ransomware and Downloader/Dropper, all around 1%[44]. While\nother repots mention slightly different findings such as Memory Dumper, Remote Access Tool (RAT),\nDownloader, Keylogger, Click Fraud/Malvertising, Backdoor, Persistence and Botnet being in the top 8\nlist[116].\n\n- Apps and consequently app stores remain main target for “packaging” and spread of malware. Yet in\n2015, we have seen successful attempts to overcome vetting processes of official app stores, led by\nrecent Apple store hack that has affected possibly thousands of apps[45], potentially used by hundreds\nof millions of users[46,47]. Android app stores suffered similar incidents in the reporting period[48].

Involve all\nrelevant roles, including executives, operations and end-users.\n\n\n\n- Update of malware mitigation controls regularly and adapt to new attack methods/vectors.\n\n\n##### Web based attacks\n\nWeb based attacks are that rely on the web as a means to detect exploits and finally install malware. In\norder to achieve this objective, both web servers and web clients are in the focus of cyber criminals. Web\nbased attacks include malicious URLs, compromised web pages (aka watering hole attacks), drive-by\nattacks, web backdoors and browser exploits. The core element of web based attacks remain malicious or\nbad URLs. These are URLs that have been compromised and/or contain malware or redirect to malware\nwith the objective to infect end-user devices. With hundreds of millions of malicious URLs[53], this threat is\nthe main instrument to deploy malicious code attacks and score at the second position of malicious online\nobjects with ca. 32% (directly following AdWare[49]). The continuous increase of web based attacks is an\nindication about changes in tactics regarding infection methods, in particular the increasing role of social\nscams[52].\n\nIn this reporting period we have assessed that:\n\n  - Changes in tactics for infection campaigns have been observed[53]. In particular, sending malicious\nobjects via e-mail attachments has declined in recent years. Instead, social (Facebook) scams,\ndownloaders, redirects and phishing are gaining in importance[43,52]. It is expected that use of these\nmethods will continue growing in the future. The role of browser exploits as a basic web based attack\nvector becomes apparent from the fact that browser exploits top the list as payload of the most\nfrequently accessed malicious URLs[117,54].\n\n  - An obfuscation method used within this threat is to misuse web shells of servers using SSL and install\ndrive-by download malware on those machines. In this case, communication between compromised\nserver and victim devices is encrypted, thus difficult to trace. Other methods used to obfuscate is to\nuse chains of URL re-directs that are often changed. These redirect chains lead to few high-end\nservers maintained by the cyber-criminals. Using permanently changing redirection URLs, make the\ndiscovery of their servers a difficult to achieve task. While 90% of bad URLs are used for spam, their\ncharacteristic is that they change within hours or minutes, making their filtering difficult[53].\n\n  - Another interesting development in the area of web based threat has been observed in 2015:\nmalvertising campaigns use browser plugins that are bundled within “unwanted software” packages.\nIn order to evade detection, some 4000 different names and 500 domains are being used for these\nplugins and used URLs. Moreover, the URL encoding scheme has been changed and normal web\ntraffic has been used[52 ]instead. This tactic has proven its efficiency by increases in the number of\ninfections.\n\n51 [http://www.misp-project.org/, accessed November 2015.](http://www.misp-project.org/)\n52 [http://www.cisco.com/web/offers/pdfs/cisco-msr-2015.pdf, accessed October 2015.](http://www.cisco.com/web/offers/pdfs/cisco-msr-2015.pdf)\n53 [https://www.webroot.com/shared/pdf/Webroot_2015_Threat_Brief.pdf, accessed October 2015.](https://www.webroot.com/shared/pdf/Webroot_2015_Threat_Brief.pdf)\n54 [https://www.sophos.com/en-us/threat-center/medialibrary/PDFs/other/sophos-trends-and-predictions-](https://www.sophos.com/en-us/threat-center/medialibrary/PDFs/other/sophos-trends-and-predictions-2015.pdf?cmp=70130000001xKqzAAE)\n\n[2015.pdf?cmp=70130000001xKqzAAE, accessed October 2015.](https://www.sophos.com/en-us/threat-center/medialibrary/PDFs/other/sophos-trends-and-predictions-2015.pdf?cmp=70130000001xKqzAAE)\n\n\n-----\n\n| January 2016\n\n- Ca. 58 thousand malicious URLs per day are detected at the level of CERTs[42]. This sums up to 20\nmillion malicious URLs yearly. Given the fact that ca. 90% of those change daily/hourly, we end up\nwith few hundreds millions of bad URLs. Blacklisting those and keep the list up to date with reliable\ndata is a challenge, but also important to reduce malware infection[53]. It has been reported that some\n80 thousand IPs are added to blacklists on a daily basis[53]. Many products/offerings have been\ndeveloped in this area, including open source blacklists[55,56,57,58]. An overview of available open source\nblacklist offerings can be found in 59.\n\n- A view on web based attack statistics unveils important details behind web based attacks. Top five\ncategories of web sites exploited are: technology, hosting, blogging, business and anonymizer (i.e.\nservices providing anonymity). The most common threats found is browser exploit, followed by virus\nand phishing[43]. While clicking on mailed malicious link is also considered as belonging to the top\ninfection vectors[85]. Malicious URL is considered to be the second on the top 20 list of malicious\nobjects online[44].\n\n- Regarding the geography of malicious URLs, there have been some changes between 2014 and 2015.\nWhile US remains the first county hosting malicious URLs (with ca. 40% of those), in 2015 France (ca.\n8%) and Germany (ca. 4%) have been replaced from second and third place by Russia (ca. 6%) and\nPortugal (ca. 3%). The Netherlands retained the fourth position with ca. 2% of global malicious\nURLs[42,117]. Interestingly, countries with the highest rate in clicking of malicious URLs are US (ca. 30%),\nJapan (ca. 20%) and Taiwan (ca. 4%)[117]. It is argued that the sequence of countries is related to the\nwealth of citizens/market and/or the availability of protection measures against abuse of web\ninfrastructure components.\n\nObserved current trend for this threat: increasing\n\nRelated threats: Malware, Exploit Kit, Phishing, Web application attacks, Spam, Botnet, Ransomware.\n\nAuthoritative Resources 2015: ”Internet Security Threat Report 20” Symantec[43], “A Rising Tide: New Hacks\nThreaten Public technologies”, TrendLabs 2Q 2015 Security Roundup, Trend Micro[117], “CERT POLSKA\nREPORT 2014”, CERT.PL NASK 2015[42], “WEBROOT 2015 THREAT BRIEF”, WEBROOT APRIL 2015[53].\n\n\n**Mitigation vector: The mitigation vector for this threat contains the following elements[43]:**\n\n\n\n- Protection of end point from unpatched software containing known vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n- Avoidance of installation of malicious programs through potentially unwanted programs (PUPs).\n\n\n\n- Monitoring of behaviour of software to detect malicious object, such as web browser plug-ins.\n\n\n\n- Filtering web browser traffic to detect obfuscated web based attacks.\n\n\n\n- Web address, web content, files and applications reputation solutions, blacklisting and filtering to\nestablish risk-oriented categorization of web resources.\n\n- Check application and web-browser settings in order to avoid unwanted behaviour based on default\nsettings (esp. for mobile devices).\n\n55 [http://www.brightcloud.com/services/web-classification.php, accessed October 2015.](http://www.brightcloud.com/services/web-classification.php)\n56 [https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2008/11/the-case-against-url-blacklists.html, accessed October](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2008/11/the-case-against-url-blacklists.html)\n\n2015.\n57 [http://urlblacklist.com, accessed October 2015.](http://urlblacklist.com/)\n58 [http://www.surbl.org, accessed October 2015.](http://www.surbl.org/)\n59 [http://dsi.ut-capitole.fr/documentations/cache/squidguard_en.html#contrib, accessed October 2014.](http://dsi.ut-capitole.fr/documentations/cache/squidguard_en.html#contrib)\n\n\n-----\n\n| January 2016\n\n\n\n- Patching of software and firmware to the latest version supported by the vendor.\n\n\n\n  - Whitelisting of applications to define legitimate software as authorised and block the execution of\nrogue software.\n\n  - Removing functions from web browsers that are not necessary for business processes, like Adobe Flash\nplugin.\n\n##### Web application attacks\n\nGiven the fact that application are increasingly web enabled, that is, are open to web access or are using\nweb resources, attacks to applications from within the web has become a major attack vector. This attack\nvector is referred to as web application attacks. There is a variety of attack methods to web applications,\nand, as applications architectures encompass additional components, the window of opportunity for web\napplication attacks increases. Hence, “traditional” web application attacks such as cross-site scripting and\nSQL-injection (SQLi) exposures that were reported to be at a decreasing rate in 2014, have increased in\n2015[60]. Similarly, manipulation of libraries used Software Development Kits (SDK), abuse of transported\ndata, data leakages, abuse of vulnerabilities and evasion of vetting processes of app stores became main\nattack methods. All this makes web application attacks an important tool for malware injections but also\nfor information leakage and data breaches. In the reporting period we have seen a few compromises in\napps that have already passed vetting checks[46,47], while currently developed analysis techniques shed\nadditional light to weaknesses that are “built in” in apps[61].\n\nIn the reporting period we have assessed that:\n\n  - The window of availability of web vulnerabilities in various sectors is quite large. In many sectors, a\nsignificant part of web sites (ranging from 30-55%) seem to be always vulnerable, while the part that\nrarely contains vulnerabilities is rather low (ranging from 18-ca. 40%). The most exposed sector seems\nto be public administration, with low number of vulnerabilities but very large window of remediation.\nThe sectors with the less vulnerabilities and most efficient vulnerability remediation are arts,\nentertainment and education[62].\n\n  - It is worth mentioning that attacks tactics differ among web applications found on web pages and\nmobile applications[63]. While in mobile applications attacks are based on the quality of code, attacks\non web pages abuse more often the environment of the application. On the other hand, abuse of\nerrors (i.e. error code messages) is an attack method mainly surfaced in web applications. However,\nthe general trends regarding attacks are similar in both web and mobile applications: abuse of APIs\nfollows abuse of environment and abuse of security features[63]. These statistics go along the lines of\ngenerally assessed vulnerability likelihood of web applications. Here, we find at the top positions:\ntransport layer protection, information leakage, XSS, brute force, content sniffing, cross-site request\nforgery and URL redirection[62].\n\n  - Application attacks are a significant part in DDoS attacks. In such DDoS attacks, SQL injection and local\nfile inclusion (LFI) are the prevailing attack vectors (especially in HTTP)[60], while attacks on Java play a\n\n60 [http://www.imperva.com/docs/HII_Web_Application_Attack_Report_Ed6.pdf, accessed December 2015.](http://www.imperva.com/docs/HII_Web_Application_Attack_Report_Ed6.pdf)\n61 [http://sinfonier-project.net/, accessed October 2015.](http://sinfonier-project.net/)\n62 [https://www.whitehatsec.com/press-releases/featured/2015/05/21/pressrelease.html, accessed October 2015.](https://www.whitehatsec.com/press-releases/featured/2015/05/21/pressrelease.html)\n63 [http://www.asial.com.au/documents/item/113, accessed October 2014.](http://www.asial.com.au/documents/item/113)\n\n\n-----\n\n| January 2016\n\nvery minor role (ca. 1%)[82]. Moreover, it is worth mentioning that SQL reflection attacks are an\nimportant attack vector in DDoS[64].\n\n- In the reporting period we have seen Shellshock- a threat that has appeared in 2014 - reaching top\nposition in web application attacks, especially the ones encountered over HTTPS. In total, Shellshock\ntoped the web application attack statistics (ca. 40%), followed by SQLi (ca. 28%) and LFI (ca. 18%)[82].\n\n- US almost monopolizes the countries targeted by web application attacks by “attracting” ca 80% of\nattacks worldwide. Given the fact that US is followed by Brazil (7%) and China (4%), the rest of the\nworld shares ca. 9% of the volume of DDoS attacks on web application. In particular these statistics\nshow that for European countries this threat is of very low relevance[82].\n\n- Yet quite known in the security area, it is interesting to refer to evidence found reports about the\nefficiency of vulnerability remediation in accordance to the roles accountable for possible incidents.\nThe biggest vulnerability remediation rates have been achieved when board of directors and\nexecutive management have been accountable for breaches. Interestingly, when breach\naccountability was with security department, the lowest remediation rates have been achieved[62]. It is\nworth noticing that the largest remediation rates of vulnerabilities are achieved when compliance is\nthe driver, while vulnerability remediation due to a risk oriented posture is delivering lowest\nremediation rates.\n\n- One can conclude that web application attacks is an area that is highly dynamic, multi-faceted and\nthat has potential to climb further to the top cyber security threats. Especially countries with a certain\nwealth should expect attacks targeting applications with financial background.\n\nObserved current trend for this threat: increasing\n\nRelated threats: Denial of Service, Web based attacks, Information leakage, Malware, Botnets, Data\nbreaches.\n\nAuthoritative Resources 2015: “Website Security Statistics Report 2015” WhiteHat SECURITY[62], “akamai’s\n\n[state of the internet] / security Q2 2015 report”[82], “2015 Web Application Attack Report (WAAR)”,\nIMPREVA[60], “Cyber Risk Report 2015”, HR Security Research[63].\n\n\n**Mitigation vector: The mitigation vector for this threat contains the following elements[120]:**\n\n\n\n- Formulation of security policies for the development and operation of applications.\n\n\n\n- Installation of Web application firewalling (WAF)[65].\n\n\n\n- Performance of traffic filtering to all relevant channels (web, network, mail).\n\n\n\n- Performance of input verification.\n\n\n\n- Deployment of bandwidth management.\n\n\n\n- Performance of regular web application vulnerability scanning and intrusion detection.\n\n\n##### Botnets\n\nBotnets are one of the most important infrastructure components for the deployment of various types of\ncyber-attacks.

Being of such an importance for cyber-crime, they are in the focus of cyber-defenders: as in\nprevious years, in the reporting period we have seen a lot of developments regarding this cyber-threat.\nGlobally coordinated takedowns from law enforcement have contributed to the declining trend of this\nthreat[66], while the efficacy of this method continues being controversially discussed in the cyber-security\ncommunity[67]. Cyber-criminals have continued improving methods and technology to create difficultly\ndetectable botnets. Beyond the use of encryption and TOR, new variants of Gameover Zeus botnet, for\nexample, have abandoned peer-to-peer (P2P) networks (upon a weakness of P2P the takedown has been\nperformed). They also deploy domain generation algorithm (DGA) to establish C2C communication over\nmalicious, short lived domains[68]. Moreover, attackers seem to always look for new opportunities to abuse\nweaknesses in order to install botnet functionality in various IT-devices[69,70].\n\nIn the reporting period we have assessed that:\n\n- Botnet prevention policies range from take downs to individual holistic end-point protection. Both\nmethods are quite challenging, given the inherent property of botnets to morph. Botnet takedowns\nare very effective in reducing this threat, at least for a certain period. The reduction of this threat in\n2015 is attributed to law enforcement takedowns. Some methods for takedowns have been\nencountered in relevant reports[71]. The ones that are publicly known are global coordinated law\nenforcement takedowns[66]. In a recent cyber-security event, during the debate about efficacy of\ntakedowns, FBI has informed that law enforcement would like to obtain enough capabilities to achieve\ntakedowns as a quick response to botnets, by also involving other players[72]. Other players in cyberprotection argue that the best defence seems to be a unified web security solution with real time\ninspection functions for all kinds of data exchanged, while capitalizing on available collected,\nconsolidated, correlated, validated and shared information[73].\n\n- In the reporting period it has become clear that botnets are one of the most important business cases\nfor cyber-criminals (aka botnet-for-hire) and the main element in cyber-crime consumerization. To this\nextend, botnets are the first item that has reached market maturity in the area of Cybercrime-As-AService. In the reporting period we have seen prices between USD 20 and 40 for one hour per month\nDDoS attacks performed via botnets, aiming at increasing attack amplification/attack bandwidth. The\nfact that between 20 and 40% of the DDoS attacks have botnet fingerprint[81], is indicative for the level\nof adoption of botnets for cyber-attacks. Enabling big impact attacks at low costs is the main driver for\nthe increasing use of this tool[81]. At the same time this is a major concern of cyber-security experts and\nbusiness users.\n\n- Market forces dictate the existence and offered functionality of botnets. Botnet owners create such\ninfrastructures for short period of time, take them down and go online again. The resilience of botnets\nhas been effectively demonstrated with the ZeroAccess botnet: after the coordinated law enforcement\n\n66 [http://www.interpol.int/News-and-media/News/2015/N2015-038, accessed October 2015.](http://www.interpol.int/News-and-media/News/2015/N2015-038)\n67 [http://www.scmagazineuk.com/botnet-takedowns-are-they-worth-it/article/428021/, accessed October 2015.](http://www.scmagazineuk.com/botnet-takedowns-are-they-worth-it/article/428021/)\n68 [https://www.cloudmark.com/releases/docs/threat_report/cloudmark-security-threat-report-15q2.pdf, accessed](https://www.cloudmark.com/releases/docs/threat_report/cloudmark-security-threat-report-15q2.pdf)\n\nOctober 2015.\n69 [https://www.incapsula.com/blog/ddos-botnet-soho-router.html, accessed October 2015.](https://www.incapsula.com/blog/ddos-botnet-soho-router.html)\n70 [https://www.bluecoat.com/security-blog/2015-01-09/botnet-internet-things, accessed October 2015.](https://www.bluecoat.com/security-blog/2015-01-09/botnet-internet-things)\n71 [http://www.level3.com/~/media/files/white-paper/en_secur_wp_botnetresearchreport.pdf, accessed October](http://www.level3.com/~/media/files/white-paper/en_secur_wp_botnetresearchreport.pdf)\n\n2015.\n72 [http://swisscyberstorm.com/presentations/alan_neville.pdf, accessed October 2015.](http://swisscyberstorm.com/presentations/alan_neville.pdf)\n73 [http://www.secureworks.com/assets/pdf-store/other/banking-botnets-persist-2015.pdf, accessed October 2015.](http://www.secureworks.com/assets/pdf-store/other/banking-botnets-persist-2015.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\n| January 2016\n\ntake down, the botnet has been revived (around 15[th] January 2015) performing a distribution of clickfraud templates[74,75. ]Yet, this is not the only revived botnet. This fact comes in support of botnet\ntakedown critics[76 ]. Other botnets disappear, such as Rustock and Srizbi[116]. Short time after Gameover\nZeus takedown, researchers identified new variant of the botnet. It has the same code as Gameover\nZeus without P2P functionality (the weakness upon which the botnet has been taken down)[73]. Instead,\nfor backend and C2 communications it uses domain generation algorithm (DGA[77]).\n\n- Some key figures regarding botnets contribute towards understanding their importance and role. In\nthe reporting period, a single botnet (Nidol) is responsible for ca. 60% of all application layer attacks[81].\nThe average lifetime of a botnet is estimated with ca. 38 days[71]. The average size of a single botnet is\nca. 1700 infected servers. In 2015, ca. 600 to 1000 C2s has been identified. Each one, in turn, consists\nof few hundreds of thousands of infected computers[71]. Moreover, botnets can be created in a short\nperiod but reach considerable sizes, as it was the case with the botnet of SOHO[78] or MrBlack[79] routers.\nTogether with the information presented in the bullets above, it becomes apparent that it is difficult to\nidentify all existing botnets (both active and inactive ones), or to hinder the creation of new ones.\nFrom this point of view, establishing a holistic security protection at the endpoints seems to be a good\ndefence strategy.\n\n- It has been argued, that botnet operators are in favour of using rogue virtual machines for their C2\nserver infrastructure. This is a shift from infecting legitimate servers with bot malware. In this way they\nuse technological advantages of virtualized platforms, those being performance, efficient management\nand scaling, lower risk of detection, stability of could service, etc. The high density of botnets in areas\nwith VM hosting providers (i.e. US), might be a phenomenon resulting this trend[71]. Statistics about\ncountries from which C2 traffic originates show that top 10 countries such attacks originated from are:\nUS, Ukraine, Russia, The Netherlands, Germany, Turkey, France, UK, Vietnam and Romania[71]. Though\nnot fully representative, these statistics give an overview of geographic locations with high botnet\ndensity.\n\nObserved current trend for this threat: decreasing\n\nRelated threats: Denial of Service, Web application attacks, Web based attacks, Malware, Data breaches.\n\nAuthoritative Resources 2015: “SAFEGUARDING THE INTERNET LEVEL 3 BOTNET RESEARCH REPORT”, Level\n(3) COMMUNICATIONS[71], IMPREVA | incapsula “Q2 2015 Global DDoS Threat Landscape”[81], “Banking\nBotnets Persist Despite Takedowns”, April 2015, Dell SecureWorks[73].\n\n\n**Mitigation vector: The mitigation vector for this threat contains the following elements:**\n\n\n\n- Installation and configuration of network and application firewalling.\n\n\n\n- Performance of traffic filtering to all relevant channels (web, network, mail).\n\n\n74 [https://acsc.gov.au/publications/ACSC_Threat_Report_2015.pdf, accessed October 2015.](https://acsc.gov.au/publications/ACSC_Threat_Report_2015.pdf)\n75 [https://www.hkcert.org/my_url/en/blog/15042801, accessed October 2015.](https://www.hkcert.org/my_url/en/blog/15042801)\n76 [http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/news/4500256186/Dridex-malware-returns-despite-DoJ-](http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/news/4500256186/Dridex-malware-returns-despite-DoJ-arrests?utm_medium=EM&asrc=EM_NLN_49188856&utm_campaign=20151028_Dridex%20banking%20Trojan,%20botnets%20wreaking%20havoc%20again%20despite%20DOJ%20takedown_oeckerson&utm_source=NLN&track=NL-1820&ad=903816&src=903816)\n\n[arrests?utm_medium=EM&asrc=EM_NLN_49188856&utm_campaign=20151028_Dridex%20banking%20Trojan,%2](http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/news/4500256186/Dridex-malware-returns-despite-DoJ-arrests?utm_medium=EM&asrc=EM_NLN_49188856&utm_campaign=20151028_Dridex%20banking%20Trojan,%20botnets%20wreaking%20havoc%20again%20despite%20DOJ%20takedown_oeckerson&utm_source=NLN&track=NL-1820&ad=903816&src=903816)\n[0botnets%20wreaking%20havoc%20again%20despite%20DOJ%20takedown_oeckerson&utm_source=NLN&track=](http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/news/4500256186/Dridex-malware-returns-despite-DoJ-arrests?utm_medium=EM&asrc=EM_NLN_49188856&utm_campaign=20151028_Dridex%20banking%20Trojan,%20botnets%20wreaking%20havoc%20again%20despite%20DOJ%20takedown_oeckerson&utm_source=NLN&track=NL-1820&ad=903816&src=903816)\n[NL-1820&ad=903816&src=903816, accessed October 2015.](http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/news/4500256186/Dridex-malware-returns-despite-DoJ-arrests?utm_medium=EM&asrc=EM_NLN_49188856&utm_campaign=20151028_Dridex%20banking%20Trojan,%20botnets%20wreaking%20havoc%20again%20despite%20DOJ%20takedown_oeckerson&utm_source=NLN&track=NL-1820&ad=903816&src=903816)\n77 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_generation_algorithm, accessed November 2015.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_generation_algorithm)\n78 [https://www.incapsula.com/blog/ddos-botnet-soho-router.html, accessed October 2015.](https://www.incapsula.com/blog/ddos-botnet-soho-router.html)\n79 [http://www.extremetech.com/computing/205525-anonymous-may-have-hijacked-thousands-of-routers-for-](http://www.extremetech.com/computing/205525-anonymous-may-have-hijacked-thousands-of-routers-for-zombie-botnet)\n\n[zombie-botnet, accessed October 2015.](http://www.extremetech.com/computing/205525-anonymous-may-have-hijacked-thousands-of-routers-for-zombie-botnet)\n\n\n-----\n\n| January 2016\n\n\n\n- Installation and maintenance of IP address blacklisting.\n\n\n\n- Performance of Botnet Sinkholing[80].\n\n\n\n- Performance of updates in a regular basis in orchestration with vulnerability management.\n\n\n##### Denial of service\n\nAlso in 2015, DDoS attacks continue to be an important tool for cyber threat agents. Our analysis for this\ncyber threat is based mainly on data of providers of DDoS protection solutions, CERTs and threat\nintelligence organisations. The trends that have been unambiguously assessed are increased volumes and\nfurther optimization of attack practices[81,82]. Increase in the volume has been observed due to more\nattacks; but with lower average bandwidth as in the previous year[82]. Yet, in this year the average duration\nof the attacks has increased. A second change in the attack profile is related to the used infrastructure:\nthere is a trend of replacing powerful equipment of the past (i.e. server-based botnet) with low end\ndevices such as network router. In many cases, such devices have been selected from purely secured\nhome-based components, including Internet of Things devices (i.e. home routers, various internet\nconnected devices, embedded systems, etc.). In such environments, the use of the Universal Plug and Play\nProtocol is being misused by means of SSDP reflectors. This protocol has achieved a high percentage in the\nDDoS statistics within a year, being second but almost at the same level with SYN attacks. It is remarkable\nto see a warning issued by a law enforcement agency, in particular FBI, about the risks emanating from\nInternet of Things environments[83]. This is considered as the right step towards awareness raising. Finally, in\nthe reporting period we have seen a new monetization attempt based on DDoS: cyber-criminals request\nransom in order to stop DDoS attacks that they have launched against an organisation[84].\n\nIn the reporting period we have assessed that:\n\n  - DDoS statistics provide strong evidence about the dynamics behind this cyber-threat. Compared to\nsimilar period of 2014, significant increases in all parameters of DDoS have been encountered, in\nparticular: over 130% increase in total number of attacks, over 120% increase in application level\nattacks, over 130% increase in infrastructure level attacks and 100% increase in attacks over 100\nGpbs[82]. Decreases in the average bandwidth and average volume of attacks can be attributed to\nchanges in the attack tactics, rather than to any other defence-related aspects.\n\n  - Regarding the statistics of DDoS attacks targets, it has been reported that the sectors Gaming,\nSoftware and Technology and Internet providers are at the top 3 positions with ca. 35%, 27% and 13%\nrespectively. Financial, retail and public sector are rather low with shares of ca. 8%, 2,5% and 1,5% of\nDDoS attacks[81]. On the other hand, incident information indicates that public, retail and financial\norganisations lead the victim statistics[85]. This fact may lead to obvious conclusions about the posture\nregarding DDoS defences of the latter sectors and/or about incident reporting tactics of victim\norganisations.\n\n80 [http://la.trendmicro.com/media/misc/sinkholing-botnets-technical-paper-en.pdf, accessed October 2015.](http://la.trendmicro.com/media/misc/sinkholing-botnets-technical-paper-en.pdf)\n81 [https://www.incapsula.com/blog/ddos-global-threat-landscape-report-q2-2015.html, accessed September 2015.](https://www.incapsula.com/blog/ddos-global-threat-landscape-report-q2-2015.html)\n82 [https://www.stateoftheinternet.com/resources-cloud-security-2015-q2-web-security-report.html, accessed](https://www.stateoftheinternet.com/resources-cloud-security-2015-q2-web-security-report.html)\n\nSeptember 2015.\n83 [http://www.ic3.gov/media/2015/150910.aspx, accessed September 2015.](http://www.ic3.gov/media/2015/150910.aspx)\n84 [http://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-extortion-dd4bc-new-zealand-ddos-attacks/, accessed November 2015.](http://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-extortion-dd4bc-new-zealand-ddos-attacks/)\n85 [http://www.verizonenterprise.com/resources/reports/rp_data-breach-investigation-report-2015_en_xg.pdf,](http://www.verizonenterprise.com/resources/reports/rp_data-breach-investigation-report-2015_en_xg.pdf)\n\naccessed September 2015.\n\n\n-----\n\n| January 2016\n\n- DDoS botnets have demonstrated the agility of adversaries in adapting their practices. While ca. 60%\nof the DDoS bots in 2014 identified themselves as search engine impersonator bots, this technique has\nbeen almost entirely abandoned in 2015, after defences (IP based verification techniques) have been\ndeveloped[81,86]. It is interesting that in the reporting period, DDoS bots user agent variants (i.e. crawler\nvariants that mimic legitimate user agents) have demonstrated a diversity that was not present in\n2014: while in 2014 most common user agents covered ca. 90% of all attacks, in 2015 the most\ncommon ones have been found in ca. 43%[81]. Moreover, it is assumed that slow, longer lasting DDoS\nattacks are used to attract the attention of security teams and achieve malware infections and data\nexfiltration[87].\n\n- A significant change has happened in the reporting period with regard to the used DDoS attack\nvectors. In 2015, single vector attacks (i.e. attacks to a single component of infrastructure layer or\napplication) are in the majority (ca. 56%) while multiple vector attacks (i.e. attacks to multiple\ncomponent of infrastructure layer or application) account for ca. 44% of the attacks. The former attack\nvector seems to be part of a “hit and run” tactic, a short attack that serves reconnaissance purposes of\nthe victim’s defences[81]. While multi-vector, long-duration attacks may target victims with the objective\nof creating damage in their systems.\n\n- The growing cyber-crime tools market provides DDoS-as-a-service offerings. Depending on bandwidth\nand attack mix, prices from ca. 20 to 40 $ are common for ca. 1 hour per moth usage of DDoS botnets.\nThere is evidence that ca. 40% of the DDoS traffic is generated by such DDoS-for-hire offerings[81,82]. It is\nimportant to underline that such services deliver to any non-specialized individual tools to perform\npowerful DDoS attacks at affordable prices. This fact introduces a risk potential to IT infrastructures\nand services that is very difficult to calculate.\n\n- Studies performed in the reporting period have given an insight into the impact resulting a successful\nDDoS attack and the costs connected hereto[88,89]. As regards the impact, ca. 2/3 of victims had\ntemporarily lost access to critical information, 1/3 have been unable to carry out main businesses and\nanother 1/3 had lost business opportunities/contracts[88]. The costs of DDoS attacks have been\ncalculated with 40.000$ per hour, while average costs of successful DDoS attacks may range from 40 –\n500 K $. Ca. 1/3 of responders calculate costs per hour being between ca. 5 and 20K $. Costs are in\nanalogy to the company size. These figures reflect remediation costs resulting a successful attack.\n\nObserved current trend for this threat: increasing\n\nRelated threats: Botnets, Web Application Attacks, Web Based Attacks, Malware, Data Breaches, Identity\ntheft, Information leakage.\n\nAuthoritative Resources 2015: “akamai’s [state of the internet] / security Q2 2015 report”[82], IMPREVA |\nincapsula “Q2 2015 Global DDoS Threat Landscape”[81].\n\n\n**Mitigation vector: The mitigation vector for this threat contains the following elements[120]:**\n\n\n86 [http://www.youngupstarts.com/2015/08/21/q2-2015-ddos-trends-the-fall-of-search-engine-impersonators/,](http://www.youngupstarts.com/2015/08/21/q2-2015-ddos-trends-the-fall-of-search-engine-impersonators/)\n\naccessed September 2015.\n87 [http://www.computerweekly.com/news/4500253349/Most-DDoS-attacks-hiding-something-more-sinister-](http://www.computerweekly.com/news/4500253349/Most-DDoS-attacks-hiding-something-more-sinister-Neustar-warns)\n\n[Neustar-warns, accessed September 2015.](http://www.computerweekly.com/news/4500253349/Most-DDoS-attacks-hiding-something-more-sinister-Neustar-warns)\n88 [https://media.kaspersky.com/en/B2B-International-2014-Survey-DDoS-Summary-Report.pdf, accessed September](https://media.kaspersky.com/en/B2B-International-2014-Survey-DDoS-Summary-Report.pdf)\n\n2015.\n89 [http://lp.incapsula.com/rs/incapsulainc/images/eBook%20-%20DDoS%20Impact%20Survey.pdf, accessed](http://lp.incapsula.com/rs/incapsulainc/images/eBook%20-%20DDoS%20Impact%20Survey.pdf)\n\nSeptember 2015.\n\n\n-----\n\n| January 2016\n\n\n\n- Creation of a DoS/DDoS security policy including a reaction plan to detected incidents.\n\n\n\n  - Selection of a technical DoS/DDoS protection approach (e.g. Firewall based, Access Control Lists (ACLs),\nLoad-balancer, IPS/WAF, Intelligent DDoS mitigation systems (IDMS) at network perimeter, Cloudbased DDoS mitigation service, etc.)[90].\n\n  - Assessment and documentation of roles of all third parties involved in the implemented protection\nDoS/DDoS approach.

The impressive fact about this (certainly noncyber) threat is that it continues to be one of the leading causes for data breaches and identity theft. For\nthis very reason, we have heighten its rank in the top 15 threat in comparison to the previous years. The\nincreasing trend, however observed so far seems to slow down coming to a slight increase[128] to almost\nstable[126 ]in 2015. In some particular sectors such as in healthcare however, the increasing trend keeps up.\nThis fact underlines the necessity to keep an eye on this threat by introducing mitigation controls in a\nsector-dependent fashion. The numbers assessed about this threat are probably affected by US incidents,\nas US imposes reporting obligation for physical loss. Such cases are making up a considerable part of the\nIdentity Theft Resource Centre[91]. Naturally, the majority of loss incidents happens in the work space (ca.\n55%), while ca. 22% involve vehicles[85]. These trivial facts should be part of permanent awareness measures\naiming at the reduction of this threat (see also mitigation methods for this threat below).\n\nIn the reporting period we have assessed that:\n\n  - Although physical theft/loss caused by own employees is reported as the 3[rd] most serious reason for\ndata breaches[85], if seen in common with theft caused by external partners, this threat is potentially at\nthe first position, especially in particular sectors like healthcare, public/government and financial[126].\nEven in global statistics about materialized threats, it ranks at ca. the 7[th] position[85].\n\n  - It seems that the reporting regarding physical theft/damage/loss will need some more systematic\nclassification: in the reporting period, some researchers have seen manipulation of physical access[85] to\ncyber-assets belonging to this category, while others have discriminated among employees and\noutsiders and cases of loss (e.g. portable device loss vs. physical loss and stationary device loss[126]). This\ncan be seen as an inconsistency in handling incidents emanating from same or similar groups (i.e.\ninsiders). Putting this wright might help to better scrutinize the necessary controls in order to increase\ntheir efficiency.\n\n  - Physical theft/damage/loss is maybe one of the most usual causes in areas with very sensitive data,\nsuch as health and government. In particular in government, if loss of devices, physical loss and\nstationary device loss are subsumed under the same category, they rank as first in the breach methods\n(over 50%), far above hacking (ca. 17%)[126]. This is in fact also the case for the areas healthcare and\n\n90 [http://www.arbornetworks.com/news-and-events/press-releases/2015-press-releases/5351-arbor-networks-10th-](http://www.arbornetworks.com/news-and-events/press-releases/2015-press-releases/5351-arbor-networks-10th-annual-worldwide-infrastructure-security-report-finds-50x-increase-in-ddos-attack-size-in-past-decade)\n\n[annual-worldwide-infrastructure-security-report-finds-50x-increase-in-ddos-attack-size-in-past-decade, accessed](http://www.arbornetworks.com/news-and-events/press-releases/2015-press-releases/5351-arbor-networks-10th-annual-worldwide-infrastructure-security-report-finds-50x-increase-in-ddos-attack-size-in-past-decade)\nNovember 2015.\n91 [http://www.idtheftcenter.org/images/breach/DataBreachReports_2015.pdf, accessed October 2015.](http://www.idtheftcenter.org/images/breach/DataBreachReports_2015.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\n| January 2016\n\nfinance. Combined with available statistics of recent global cyber-threats, theft of devices by staff and\nby external partners - if taken together – it reaches 4[th] position in the statistics. As such, a loss is far\nmore likely than network intrusion and denial of service[92]! In total, researchers report that ca. 23% of\ncompanies experience loss of mobile devices[93].\n\n- It is impressive to see how often well known, rather baseline controls fail, when it is being reported\nabout findings of confidential data on sold hardware[94,95]. This is a typical case of physical loss that has\nhappened through negligence of basic data protection rules. Though mitigation of such risks is rather\nsimple, the failures demonstrate that physical loss of confidential data is rather an underestimated\nthreat that might have significant impact.\n\nObserved current trend for this threat: stable\n\nRelated threats: Information leakage, Identity theft, Data Breach\n\nAuthoritative Resources 2015: “Follow the Data: Dissecting Data Breaches and Debunking Myths” Trend\nMicro Analysis of Privacy Rights Clearinghouse 2005–2015 Data Breach Records[126].\n\n**Mitigation vector: The mitigation vector for this threat contains the following elements:**\n\n- Use of encryption in all information storage and flow that is outside the security perimeter (devices,\nnetworks). This will eliminate the impact from this threat.\n\n- Establishment of well communicated procedures for physical protection of assets, covering the cases\nof loss, damage and theft.\n\n\n\n- Use of asset inventories to keep track of user devices and remind owners to check availability.\n\n\n\n- Consideration of transferring the risks from this threat to an insurance.\n\n\n\n- Installation of processes to reduce the time for the management of theft/damage/loss incidents.\n\n\n\n- Implementation of off-site storage regimes, when applicable.\n\n\n##### Insider threat\n\nInsider threats continue to stay in focus during 2015. In this period, this threat has been considerably\nanalysed and taken into account in the analysis of cyber security incidents. In the reporting period we have\nseen some major contributions, all of those being mentioned in the list of authoritative resources of this\ncyber-threat. Coming to expand the viewpoints of previous years, the insider threat now encompasses\nunintentional actions that have led to security incidents[96]. Together with a more holistic view on the\ninvolved agents/individuals, performed analysis regarding insider threat became more comprehensive and\nholistic[85,97]. And this is quite natural, given that ca. one third of cyber security incidents are attributed to\nunintentional and intentional activities of insiders.

Finally, the increased rates of both cyber-espionage and social engineering activities, the insider\nthreat comes to a new light; they open up a large variety of exploitation channels for all kinds of misuse\nbased on insider knowledge[97].\n\nIn the reporting period we have assessed that:\n\n- Classifications of insiders foresees the following roles: current and former employees, current and\nformer providers/contractors/consultants, current and former suppliers and business partners,\ncustomers[98]. A common characteristic of all insider threat actors is that they all have physical or\nremote access to information assets of the organisation, including hard copies[99]. In all these cases,\nparticular emphasis has to be given to privileged users: over half of incidents led to data breaches are\nattributed to this user category[85]. Moreover, surveyed individuals have declared that privileged user\ncontrol and insider threat in the context of APT are the top concerns, especially in cloud\nenvironments[100]. Finally, malicious insiders seem to abuse digital access rights in order to access to\nphysical and logical company assets[97].\n\n- According to a survey, the top five reasons for the materialization of insider threat (both intentional\nand unintentional) seem to be: reduced care of employees when dealing with sensitive data;\ninsufficient training to apply security policies; increased work load and multitasking leading to reduced\nattention to security policies; inconvenience of security policies often making users ignore them, and\nusers do not take security seriously[96].\n\n- The impact of materialised insider threat is usually higher than that of most other threat agents,\neventually with the exception of cyber-espionage. Although insider threat has so serious\nconsequences, 75% of responders within a survey said that they will resolve insider incidents\ninternally, without invoking police[101]. Let alone that many companies do not have an insider threat\nprevention program. This attitude will lead to eternalization of insider threat, as potential threat\nagents may repeatedly commit their atrocity within other victim organisations.\n\n- Significant increases in incidents of insider threat may be explained by the fact that these incidents are\nincreasingly analysed, as opposed to the time before Snowden. Other explanations of the increase are\ndue to increasing monetization opportunities created by cyber-criminals or cyber-espionage. They\nmight serve as a motive for insiders to offer their knowledge[102]. Another plausible source for insider\nthreat are Bring Your Own Device and open Wi-Fi regimes that are not accompanied with effective\nsecurity measures[103]. Finally, a plausible reason seem to be the increasing pressure to workers that is\nmaterialized by increased workloads and multitasking: both giving grounds to oversee security policies.\n\n- In many cases of insider misuse attribution has been made after forensic investigations based on user\nactions and evidence found in user devices. Although such activities usually take place long after the\nthreat agent has left the company, they provide intelligence about the various cases and can be used\nas lesson learned in order to establish appropriate protection policies[85].

Main objective of phishing is to steal credentials and/or install\nmalware on the victim’s device. One can argue that phishing is the advancement of spam, as it is more\ntargeted and thus potentially more efficient; albeit having a lot of commonalities with spam as regards the\ninfrastructure used to implement it. In order to establish the desired fake confidence, phishing piggybacks\nwith events that are familiar in the breaking news. Or it tries to mimic look-and-feel from trustful\norganisations, brands, services, persons, etc. As it is the case in most of the reports analysed[107,108,43], in the\ncontext of this section phishing is differentiated from spear-phishing - a more targeted method to lure\nindividuals. Spear-phishing is covered under the threat cyber-espionage in this report (see section 3.16).\nThere are some good news about phishing: in 2015, we have assess some reduction of the exposure to this\nthreat, measured by reduction of average phishing campaigns (i.e. uptime of phishing servers). This\nsuccess is attributed mainly to efficient mitigation methods[108]. Following the same trend as spam, phishing\nis for the second year in a slightly declining trend.\n\nIn the reporting period we have assessed that:\n\n104 [http://www.information-age.com/technology/security/123459786/how-leverage-user-behaviour-analytics-](http://www.information-age.com/technology/security/123459786/how-leverage-user-behaviour-analytics-insider-threat-profiles)\n\n[insider-threat-profiles, accessed October 2015.](http://www.information-age.com/technology/security/123459786/how-leverage-user-behaviour-analytics-insider-threat-profiles)\n105 [https://community.websense.com/blogs/websense-news-releases/archive/2015/07/30/survey-finds-employee-](https://community.websense.com/blogs/websense-news-releases/archive/2015/07/30/survey-finds-employee-negligence-is-leading-cause-of-insider-threats-in-the-u-s-and-germany.aspx)\n\n[negligence-is-leading-cause-of-insider-threats-in-the-u-s-and-germany.aspx, accessed October 2015.](https://community.websense.com/blogs/websense-news-releases/archive/2015/07/30/survey-finds-employee-negligence-is-leading-cause-of-insider-threats-in-the-u-s-and-germany.aspx)\n106 [http://resources.sei.cmu.edu/asset_files/TechnicalReport/2012_005_001_34033.pdf, accessed November 2015.](http://resources.sei.cmu.edu/asset_files/TechnicalReport/2012_005_001_34033.pdf)\n107 [http://apwg.org/download/document/245/APWG_Global_Phishing_Report_2H_2014.pdf, accessed November](http://apwg.org/download/document/245/APWG_Global_Phishing_Report_2H_2014.pdf)\n\n2015.\n108 [https://securelist.com/files/2015/08/KL_Q2_2015_SPAM_REPORT_ENG.pdf, accessed November 2015.](https://securelist.com/files/2015/08/KL_Q2_2015_SPAM_REPORT_ENG.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\n| January 2016\n\n- The average uptime of a phishing campaign is an important figure indicating the duration of the\ncampaign in hours. In the reporting period, a reduction of the uptime has been observed, from ca. 32\nto about 29 hours[108]. Given that nearly half of the users who open phishing scams click on them within\nthe first hour[85], the first day of a phishing attack seems to be the most efficient for cyber-criminals.\nThis underlines the important to further reduce the uptime window of phishing attacks through timely\ndetection of the phishing server.\n\n- Like spam, phishing infrastructure is set either by registering malicious domains or by infecting\nlegitimate servers and misusing them as phishing sites. As regards servers, cyber-criminals use\navailable vulnerabilities to infect legitimate machines with phishing content and C2 functionality to\ncollect user data (after successful infection). As regards malicious domains, cybercriminals use either\nmalicious top level domains (TLDs) or subdomains[109] or Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs)[110] or\nservices called URL-shorteners[111]. There are various mitigation levels and maturities regarding these\nmethods. As regards TLDs, many of those have phishing mitigation in place and achieve shortening the\nuptime. Yet the efficiency has not fully met expectations (i.e. median uptime increased), possibly due\nto some issues in the timely execution of measures. The use of subdomains has been stable, while the\nuse of UL shorteners increased[107].\n\n- As in all cyber-threats, statistics regarding phishing are very interesting: the distribution rates of\nregistered malicious TDL domains are (ca.): .com 62%, .tk 12%, .pw 6,2%, .cn 3,4% and .net 2,7%. It is\nworth mentioning that ca. 28% of all phishing domains used are registered domains. As regards the\nsubdomain abuse method, it is estimated to be used in ca. 6-7% of all phishing attacks. The\ngeographical distribution of phishing domains is (ca.): United States 53%, Germany 5%, United\nKingdom 4%, France 3% and The Netherlands 3%[112].\n\n- As regards the statistics of attacked industries (i.e. brand names used in phishing to lure victims), ca.\n42% of phishing attacked Global Internet Portals, social networking sites 15%, banks 13,5%, Online\nStores 8% and e-payment ca 6%. Top 3 targeted brands were (ca.): Yahoo with 29%, Facebook with\n10% and Google with 5,5%[44]. This is slightly different as the statistics of 2014[108 ]with reduction of bank\nand e-payment phishing but increase of social media phishing scams.\n\n- In a study that has been published in the reporting period, one can find a detailed analysis of costs\nrelated to phishing incidents[113] for a large company (i.e. 10.000 employees). It is interesting to see that\nthe majority of costs are related to productivity losses encountered. The method followed includes,\namong other things, costs from loss of credentials, as well as potential malware infection and\nproductivity costs. The per capita cost is estimated with ca 380$, whereas a training mitigation\nmeasure worth ca. 3,7$ per user would bring ca. 50% mitigation of this threat.\n\n- Obviously, user habits are decisive for the failure or the success of phishing mitigation. It has been\nargued that user awareness may achieve ca. 5-10% phishing detection[85]. On the other hand, phishing\ntactics are decisive for the success of a campaign: a slow, persistent campaign that includes some\nmessages leads at a rate of 90% to a success[85]. Obviously this is a spear-phishing-like attack tactic. On\nthe other hand, untrained users are falling victims of phishing campaigns irrespectively of the\nawkwardness of the malicious URL. Therefore putting brand names in the domain or URL name is not a\n\n109 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subdomain, accessed November 2015.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subdomain)\n110 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalized_domain_name, accessed November 2015.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalized_domain_name)\n111 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL_shortening, accessed November 2015.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL_shortening)\n112 [http://www.mcafee.com/us/resources/reports/rp-quarterly-threat-q1-2015.pdf, assessed November 2015.](http://www.mcafee.com/us/resources/reports/rp-quarterly-threat-q1-2015.pdf)\n113 [http://info.wombatsecurity.com/hubfs/Ponemon_Institute_Cost_of_Phishing.pdf, accessed November 2015.](http://info.wombatsecurity.com/hubfs/Ponemon_Institute_Cost_of_Phishing.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\n| January 2016\n\nnecessary followed tactic.

Although spam is in a\ndeclining trend since some years now, its importance in the malicious arsenal remained at least almost\nequal: new methods of “weaponization” of this threat make it a serious threat. In the reporting period we\nhave assessed that spam is an effective means for malware distribution. Ca. 6% of overall spam volume\nincluded malicious attachments or links[116]. Moreover, in the same period malicious Office documents and\nransomware were among the distributed malicious objects[116,108,43]. Traditionally, spam had piggybacked\nwith various national and international events/happenings. Just as phishing, in 2015 spam has abused\nevents like the earthquakes in Nepal, the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, various national elections and\nan abuse of recent google algorithm update[108]. On the other hand, spam is a typical representative for\nsuccesses in coordinated international mitigation of cyber-threats: the falling spam numbers are results of\nbotnets takedowns and efficient mail filtering and bad address blacklisted through vendors and\ngovernmental agencies.\n\nIn the reporting period we have assessed that:\n\n - Spam has continued its declining trend. In 2015 a drop of ca. 7% has been assessed by the middle of\n2015 (from ca. 60% in 2014 to ca. 53% of all mail traffic in 2015)[43,108]. It is very likely that this trend will\nkeep up till the end of the year. Top spam categories were: healthcare, stock market, malicious\ncontent, dating and adult content[116]. Regarding the sources of spam, top countries are US with ca.\n14,5% of spam, Russia with ca. 8% and China with ca 7%. This is a significant change since 1Q 2015,\nwhere US, Germany and China led the top spam source countries. Expectedly, these statistics are in\nanalogy with those regarding botnets, given the fact that ca. 70% of spam is generated by bots (see\nalso section 3.5).\n\n - Just as botnets operators do, spammers try to massively create bad URLs that are at low or no cost and\nredirect to a smaller number of pages that are more laboriously structured[68]. Such low cost URLs are\n\n\n-----\n\n| January 2016\n\nshorteners (see also methods in phishing, section 3.9 Error! Reference source not found.) or\nredirection services[114]. Such ULRs are abandoned any time they are detected and/or blacklisted. While\nthey create own shorteners, they prefer using existing (hacked) shorteners or URLs, as they hold high\nreputation (e.g. Twitter’s t.co or lately bit.ly ones)[68]. It is worth mentioning that spammers also use IP\naddresses for mass mail distributions. Such IPs are represented by the octal or hexadecimal in order to\nfool spam filters[108].\n\n- As already mentioned, although decreasing in number, the weaponization of spam has made progress:\nthe rates of malware or malicious URL inclusion in spams has quadrupled since the last 2-3 years[97]!\nMoreover, there have been some interesting developments regarding the payload of spam: macro\nviruses – a ca. 15 years old malicious method- has been reused, designed to download malicious\ncode[43,108]. This method came to surprise defenders, as such a “revival” was not expected. Another\n“highlight” was the relatively high level of ransomware through fake resumes sent to small-mediumenterprises[68].\n\n- Migration of spam to mobile platforms continued in 2015. The use of Email-to-SMS gateways has been\nmisused by spammers in order to transmit malware, scams and phishing messages to device users. The\nonly information that is necessary is the phone number of victims. SMS messages as attack method\ncan cause harm, as through the interconnection of apps, SMS messages can open applications on the\nmobile device (i.e. mobile browser) and subsequently exploit the device[43]. Here again, we see how a\nrelatively old technology (SMS) can be misused to deploy their campaigns, mainly in the areas of adult\ncontent, Payday Load, Bank phishing and rogue pharmacy[43].\n\n- Just as many other cyber-threats, spam is being offered as a service. Such operators undertake the\nweaponization of the spam according to the needs of their customers. As it is the case with other\ncyber-threats, prices around spam dropped too. For example one thousand stolen e-mail addresses\nare being offered between 0,5 to 10 $. Distribution to one million verified e-mails costs between\nUSD70 and 100[43].\n\nObserved current trend for this threat: decreasing\n\nRelated threats: Malware, Identity theft, Information leakage, Web based attacks, Web application attacks,\nData Breach.\n\nAuthoritative Resources 2015: “Kaspersky SPAM AND PHISHING IN Q2 2015”, Kaspersky Lab, August\n2015[108], ”Internet Security Threat Report 20” Symantec[43], : “2015 TRUSTWAVE GLOBAL SECURITY REPORT”\nTrustwave[116].\n\n**Mitigation vector: The mitigation vector for this threat contains the same elements as phishing ([120,108,112]),**\nwith some additional controls[116,68]:\n\n- Use of a security e-mail gateway with regular (possibly automated) maintenance of filters (anti-spam,\nanti-malware, policy-based filtering).\n\n\n\n- Block of executables found in mail attachments.\n\n\n\n- Disable automatic execution of code, macros, rendering of graphics and preloading mailed links at the\nmail clients and update them frequently.\n\n- Educate the users, e.g. to ask questions such as, if they know the sender, if they feel comfortable with\nthe attachment content and type, if they recognize the subject matter of the mail, etc.\n\n114 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL_redirection, accessed November 2015.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL_redirection)\n\n\n-----\n\n| January 2016\n\n##### Exploit kits\n\nBeing developed over the few last years, exploit kits have taken a dominant position in the cyber-threat\nlandscape. They are an automated means for the deployment of malware and hold a key role in infection\nvectors: they check available vulnerabilities in the targeted environment and install the appropriate\nmalware that exploits the detected vulnerabilities. Exploit kits have mutated to one of the main tools for\ninstallation of malware. They are developed and managed in orchestration with available (zero-day)\nvulnerabilities, malware, malicious URLs, droppers and C&C infrastructures. Besides the establishment of\nrelevant infrastructures, the interplay among malicious tools and threat agents establishes also a human\ninfrastructure capable of continuously advancing attack methods and tools. It is impressive to see which\ninnovation steps have been made to enhance sophistication, but also to increase the impact achieved in\nattack campaigns based on exploit kits. These developments led to an increase of 67% in exploit kit\ndetections in the reporting period[117].\n\nIn the reporting period we have assessed that:\n\n - At the example of Angler, the most prevalent exploit kit, one can assess the sophistication[115] level\n\nachieved. The list is quite long: quick incorporation of vulnerabilities to be exploited; memory resistant\nmalware to evade anti-virus detection; obfuscation of virus scanners through use of cipher for payload;\nantivirus detection capabilities; recognition of operating system and virtualization platforms; transit\nencryption of payload; permanent change of locations with exploit kit code; obfuscation of code\ndelivery methods for browser exploits[116].\n\n - Malicious activities involving exploit kits have increased about 67% (i.e. exploit kit detections in\n\n1H2015[117]), whereas Angler deployment numbers have tripled. It is interesting that the most affected\ncountries cover ca. 80% of cases. These are Japan (ca. 50%), US (ca. 22%) and Australia (ca. 6%). This\nmeans that the rest of the globe has relatively low exposure to this threat!\n\n - The wide deployment of exploit kits in cyber-crime shows how fast the gap created by the arrest of\n\nBlackwhole developer has been re-filled. After almost two years, the exploit kit activity has not only\nrecovered, but also achieved immense growth. In the reporting period, four of the exploit kits cover ca.\n90% of exploit kit detections (Angler, Magnitude, Nuclear, Neurtino)[117].\n\n - It is impressive to see the speed of adoption of new vulnerabilities in exploit kits. Apparently, the\n\npopularity and efficiency of Angler lies in the fact of quick integration of announced vulnerabilities.\nOther exploit kits do not lay far behind: Angler covers 11 vulnerabilities, Magnitude and Nuclear 9 and\nNeutrino 8[117]. One might say that some “specialization” is recognisable: 10 of 11 Angler vulnerabilities\nconcern Adobe vulnerabilities. It is worth mentioning that Java vulnerabilities continue with declining\ndetection rates in 2015[118].\n\n115 [https://threatpost.com/analyzing-angler-the-worlds-most-sophisticated-exploit-kit/110904/, accessed October](https://threatpost.com/analyzing-angler-the-worlds-most-sophisticated-exploit-kit/110904/)\n\n2015.\n116 [https://www2.trustwave.com/rs/815-RFM-693/images/2015_TrustwaveGlobalSecurityReport.pdf, accessed](https://www2.trustwave.com/rs/815-RFM-693/images/2015_TrustwaveGlobalSecurityReport.pdf)\n\nOctober 2015.\n117 [http://www.trendmicro.com/cloud-content/us/pdfs/security-intelligence/reports/rpt_a_rising_tide.pdf, accessed](http://www.trendmicro.com/cloud-content/us/pdfs/security-intelligence/reports/rpt_a_rising_tide.pdf)\n\nOctober 2015.\n[118http://www.cisco.com/assets/global/DE/unified_channels/partner_with_cisco/newsletter/2015/edition2/downloa](http://www.cisco.com/assets/global/DE/unified_channels/partner_with_cisco/newsletter/2015/edition2/download/cisco-annual-security-report-2015-e.pdf)\n\n[d/cisco-annual-security-report-2015-e.pdf, accessed October 2015.](http://www.cisco.com/assets/global/DE/unified_channels/partner_with_cisco/newsletter/2015/edition2/download/cisco-annual-security-report-2015-e.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\n| January 2016\n\n - The deployment of attacks involving exploit kits has shown its potential, especially when attacks are\n\ncrafted with the “right mix of cyber threats”[119]. According to this publication, 10 million users have been\npotentially be infected in 10 days. Compromised domains in Japan may be an explanation for the large\nnumber of detections in that geographical area. In general it is estimated that the return on investment\nfor exploit kit and ransomware schemes is about 1425%[116]!\n\n - Being one main tool for malware weaponization and delivery, exploitation and installation, exploit kit\n\nuse-cases and deployment models vary according to roles taken or agreed upon by cyber-criminals in\nthe entire attack lifecycle[120]. For example, exploit kit developers might establish a cooperation with the\nuser of the kit, if they are allowed to deliver own malware, hence indirectly co-profiting from the\nlaunched campaign.\n\n - Due to the skills required for development and use of exploit kits, a trust relationship between\n\ndeveloper and user of the kit needs to be developed. Usually, such relationships are developed within\nunderground fora/blogs.\n\n - Efficiency of exploit kits depend on the number, severity and age of the build-in vulnerabilities to be\n\nexploited. To this extend, exploit kit developers are often parts of vulnerability discovery, acquisition\nand exploitation chain. In 2015, it has been reported that US Commerce Department would treat\nsoftware vulnerabilities as weapons[121], in order to be in the position to prosecute cyber-criminals.\n\nObserved current trend for this threat: increasing\n\nRelated threats: Web based attacks, Malware, Phishing, Web application attacks, Spam, Ransomware.\n\nAuthoritative Resources 2015: “2015 TRUSTWAVE GLOBAL SECURITY REPORT” Trustwave[116], “2015 NTT\nGROUP GLOBAL THREAT INTELLIGENCE REPORT” Solutionary[120], “A Rising Tide: New Hacks Threaten Public\ntechnologies”, TrendLabs 2Q 2015 Security Roundup, Trend Micro[117].\n\n**Mitigation vector: Exploit kits infect systems based on their vulnerabilities.

Hence the mitigation vector for this threat contains elements found in malware:\n\n - Performance of updates in a regular basis in orchestration with vulnerability management.\n\n - Malware detection should be implemented for all inbound/outbound channels, including network,\nweb and application systems in all used platforms (i.e. servers, network infrastructure, personal\ncomputers and mobile devices).\n\n - Use of a security e-mail gateway with regular (possibly automated) maintenance of filters (anti-spam,\nanti-malware, policy-based filtering), as well as content filtering to filter out unwanted attachments,\nmails with malicious content and spam.\n\n##### Data breaches\n\nData breaches are the result of successful attempts to compromise confidential information, that is,\ninformation that is protected by organisations and is important for their businesses/operations. By putting\nthe focus on cyber-space, under data breaches we consider data losses that are materialized via cyberthreat agents. As opposed to the year 2014 that was the “year of the data breach”, 2015 could be\n\n119 [http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/38943/cyber-crime/malvertising-campaign-10m-users.html, accessed October](http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/38943/cyber-crime/malvertising-campaign-10m-users.html)\n\n2015.\n[120https://www.solutionary.com/threat-intelligence/threat-reports/annual-threat-report/ntt-group-global-threat-](https://www.solutionary.com/threat-intelligence/threat-reports/annual-threat-report/ntt-group-global-threat-intelligence-report-2015/)\n\n[intelligence-report-2015/, accessed October 2015.](https://www.solutionary.com/threat-intelligence/threat-reports/annual-threat-report/ntt-group-global-threat-intelligence-report-2015/)\n121 [http://recode.net/2015/05/21/u-s-aims-to-limit-exports-of-undisclosed-software-flaws/, accessed October 2015.](http://recode.net/2015/05/21/u-s-aims-to-limit-exports-of-undisclosed-software-flaws/)\n\n\n-----\n\n| January 2016\n\ncharacterised as being a year of “smooth data breach routine”. In 2015 the number of breaches remained\nstable (eventual very slight decrease), while there was a considerable drop in the number of breached\nrecords of ca. 40%[122]. In the reporting period we have seen quite some reports providing information on\nthe threat agents behind data breaches. This is a positive development in general, albeit the numbers of\nattribution are not yet at levels similar to other crimes. Another positive development in this the fact that\ndata breaches are more strongly put in the context of other cyber-threats. That is, the interplay of the\nconfidential information loss with other cyber-threats has become subject of analysis (i.e. before and after\nthe breach[85]).\n\nIn the reporting period we have assessed that:\n\n- Despite advancements in data collection, data filtering and forensic analysis, for over 50% of the\nbreaches it is not clear how many records have been compromised[122]. Though the reasons for this are\nunknown, this indicates the low level of analysis efforts invested in incident management and in data\nbreaches in particular. When seen in combination with fact that ca. one third of attacks are of\nunknown kind[123], it is evident that the current statistics lack precision.\n\n- Protection against data breaches needs to undergo a serious reconsideration. End-user expectations\nabout data losses[124], solutions currently operated and efficiency of the controls make the\ndiversification between perceptions and reality clear: data protection strategies need to be developed\naround the data and not around a perimeter[122]. This in imperative given the high level of data flow in\nmodern IT environments (i.e. cloud, virtualization, BYOD).\n\n- Identity information is number one breached data type (over 50%). This is the reason for looking at\nrelated cyber-threats separately in ETL (see chapter 3.13). Identity loss is followed by loss of financial\naccess information (credentials) (over 20%), followed by existential data (confidential data or\nintellectual property) (over 10%) user credentials (over 10%) and nuisance data (3%)[122,126]. Top three\naffected sectors are government, health and technology (making up ca. 80% of the breaches)[122]. Some\nspread in statistics can be observed regarding the sector education (2[nd] position in _126 with ca 14% of_\nbreaches vs. 7[th] position in _122_ with ca. 7% of the breaches).\n\n- Statistics about threat agents involved in breaches show that malicious outsider (aka cyber-criminal) is\nthe first detection with over the half of data breach incidents[122,125] (ca. 60%). Accidental loss, malicious\ninsider, hacktivism and state sponsored espionage are following with ca. 20%, 12&, 2% and 2%\nrespectively. These numbers are similar in some breach reports[43] with some small deviation in the\nnumbers and threat agent groups[126].\n\n- From the analysis existing data breach incidents numerous lessons are learned and conclusions are\ndrawn. Their analysis goes up to the identification of their root causes and – when possible – to the\nfinal attribution.

For this reason, legislators consider making security incident reporting mandatory,\nat least for incidents above a certain impact threshold. ENISA plays already a role in incident reporting\nin the Telecommunication sector[127].\n\n- Discussions about impact thresholds for incident reporting will need to take place, together with\nacceptable models for the calculation of data breach monetization. Together with a “normalization”\nof data breach statistics, such measures will allow for the homogenization of data breach information.\nA homogenisation of the reporting, classification and analysis of incidents is needed. This will facilitate\nreporting and analysis of data breaches, as they will be put into a common context and will be\nclassified accordingly.\n\n- Evidence in 2015 has indicated that the speed of breach discovery is much lower than the speed to\ncompromise a system[85]. One necessary step in increasing discovery of breaches is to increase the\ndissemination speed of knowledge derived by thorough analysis efforts.\n\n- Based on estimations from 2014, in 2015 the cost of data breach has been assessed with ca. 2 to 4.3\nmillion Euros for large businesses (an increase of 233% in 2014) and ca. 100k to 430k Euros for small\nbusinesses (an increase of +273% in 2014)[128,129,130]. At the same time, due to the large number of\nbreached data in the underground market, the prices of stolen records have fallen significantly (ca.\n75% in 2015)[126].\n\nObserved current trend for this threat: stable\n\nRelated threats: Malware, Physical damage/theft/loss, Web Based Attacks, Web Application Attacks,\nPhishing, Spam, Insider threat, Information leakage, Identity theft.\n\nAuthoritative Resources 2015: “2015 DATA BREACH INVESTIGATION REPORT” Verizon[85], “2015 First Half\nReview” Findings from the BREACH LEVEL INDEX, gemalto[122], “Follow the Data: Dissecting Data Breaches\nand Debunking Myths” Trend Micro Analysis of Privacy Rights Clearinghouse 2005–2015 Data Breach\nRecords[126], ”Internet Security Threat Report 20” Symantec[43].\n\n**Mitigation vector: It is worth mentioning that due to wide nature of threats that can lead to a data breach,**\nmitigation controls mentioned overlap with other cyber-threats.

It is about theft of IDs of all kinds, that is, identity\ninformation of users. Misuse cases of this information is manifold: credentials give access to services and\ndata that can be misused, identity related data can be used to pretend being a user of a service, identity\ndata can be used in creating user profiles, etc. This threat represents the consumer part in breached data\nand is of particular importance because its misuse will directly affect customers[131], who will eventually\nbeen asked to take corrective actions[132]. In any case, a direct monetization of stolen identity information is\nobvious. This information is interesting to all kinds of threat agents as it can be misused in multiple ways,\nand as such, is a very desirable asset that can cause significant impact to end users. Given the increasing\nuse of identity information in many important areas of life like health, finance, energy and transportation,\nusers can be severely impacted if their identity data is misused. For this reason, incidents related to\nidentity are often mandatorily reported[133]. As a matter of fact, statistics show that stealing personally\nidentifiable information (PII) is at the top of reported data breaches[126]. This threat overlaps with other\nthreats mentioned in this report. Identity theft is part of data breaches and can be materialized via\ninformation leakage, phishing or malware.\n\nIn the reporting period we have assessed that:\n\n - According to NIST[134], personally identifiable information (PII) consists of any combination of: Full\nname, Home address, Email address (if private from an association/club membership, etc.), National\nidentification number, Passport number, IP address (in some cases), Vehicle registration plate number,\nDriver's license number, Face, fingerprints, or handwriting, Credit card numbers, Digital identity, Date\nof birth, Birthplace, Genetic information, Telephone number, Login name.\n\n - Information theft seems to be an important element in incidents in medical/healthcare industry. In the\nreporting period identity theft in this sector has received particular attention, from the side of\ndefenders[135], victims[136] and vendors[126]. In the reporting period there is a significant increase in\nhealthcare information breaches. If seen in combination with developments in the internet of\nthings/wearables it is obvious that this threat opens up great misuse potential in the area of\nhealthcare[137].\n\n - Statistics in the area of identity theft shows that the threat is almost stable in the reporting year in\nUS[138]. Nonetheless, identity theft in healthcare has increased, making up one third of breached\ninformation, sector-wise [126]. Besides healthcare, other affected sectors are retail (ca. 15%),\ngovernment (ca. 13%), financial and education (ca. 10% each)[ 126].

Top three\nmethods used to breach identity information are information leakage, malware and loss of device,\naccounting for more than 70% of all cases[126].\n\n  - In the meantime, various states and user/consumer organisations have understood the potential of\nthis cyber-threat and provide information[139] on how to proactively protect identity[140,141] and how to\nbehave when identity theft has occurred[142,143]. These offerings provide useful hints, raise awareness\nraising and inform about available tools at a great quality.\n\n  - Identity is an enabling factor for many applications that will emerge in the area of Internet of Things,\nvirtualization, mobile devices and services, etc. Interoperability of identities is an area where a lot of\ninternational activities are focussing on[144,145]. At the same time, identity theft can be facilitated by\nvulnerabilities introduced through complexity in interoperable systems. Some leading companies in\nthe mobile communication sector try to address interoperability with OpenID[146]. The threat of identity\ntheft is fully counter-productive with regard to such engagements, and weakens consumer trust to\nonline services.\n\nObserved current trend for this threat: stable\n\nRelated threats: Information leakage, Phishing, Physical loss/damage/theft, Malware, Web based attacks, Web\napplication attacks, Spam.\n\nAuthoritative Resources 2015: “Follow the Data: Dissecting Data Breaches and Debunking Myths” Trend Micro\nAnalysis of Privacy Rights Clearinghouse 2005–2015 Data Breach Records[126].\n\n\n**Mitigation vector: The mitigation vector for this threat contains the following elements[140]:**\n\n\n\n- All physical identity documents and copies hereof should be adequately protected against unauthorised\naccess.

Information leakage is the data breach of individual\nrecords, that is, of small but important pieces of information. Information leakage is considered as being a\ndifferent cyber threat from data breaches because stolen information differs not only quantitatively but\nalso the qualitatively from breached data. The weaknesses that are being abused in information leakage\nare usually related to malfunction of technical components[147] or application functions. Such functions are\nmisused to silently include malware in used products and services[148,149,150]. The cyber-threat information\nleakage causes theft of personally identifiable information (PII)[151]. In turn, PII can be used for fraud,\ninstallation of malware, misuse and data breaches. In 2015, leakage has been identified to be in the top 10\nrisks in web applications by OWASP[152]. Particularly attractive for adversaries are leakages in cryptographic\nfunctions, as they would reveal used secret keys. In 2014 we have seen such a threat by means of the\nHeartbleed attack[153]. Though none leaks of this format have been encountered in 2015, information\nleakage is still a major tool for threat agents as it can contribute to collection of large amounts of personal\ninformation and/or confidential data (including credentials). In the era of big data, this information has\nvalue also outside black markets[154].\n\nIn the reporting period we have assessed that:\n\n - Scientific work has shown that unexplored weaknesses of software systems might be used for\nmalicious purposes. Exploring existing software and infrastructure components is particularly relevant\nin the area of open source. In the reporting period, weaknesses in the implementation of dual IPv6 and\nIPv4 stacks have been demonstrated[155]. They have led to leaks via VPN clients, for all OS tested. This\nindicates that explorative approaches regarding leaking of critical information may carry fruits in\n\n147 [http://electronicdesign.com/embedded/common-embedded-vulnerabilities-part-2-information-leaks, accessed](http://electronicdesign.com/embedded/common-embedded-vulnerabilities-part-2-information-leaks)\n\nNovember 2015.\n148 [http://www.cbronline.com/news/enterprise-it/software/whatsspy-public-can-leak-your-whatsapp-info-to-](http://www.cbronline.com/news/enterprise-it/software/whatsspy-public-can-leak-your-whatsapp-info-to-strangers-110215-4509890)\n\n[strangers-110215-4509890, accessed November 2015.](http://www.cbronline.com/news/enterprise-it/software/whatsspy-public-can-leak-your-whatsapp-info-to-strangers-110215-4509890)\n149 [http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/41483/digital-id/whatsapp-collects-call-metadata.html, accessed November](http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/41483/digital-id/whatsapp-collects-call-metadata.html)\n\n2015.\n150 [http://www.v3.co.uk/v3-uk/analysis/2430510/dridex-banking-malware-security-experts-urge-public-to-be-wary-](http://www.v3.co.uk/v3-uk/analysis/2430510/dridex-banking-malware-security-experts-urge-public-to-be-wary-of-cyber-threat)\n\n[of-cyber-threat, accessed November 2015.](http://www.v3.co.uk/v3-uk/analysis/2430510/dridex-banking-malware-security-experts-urge-public-to-be-wary-of-cyber-threat)\n151 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personally_identifiable_information#Examples, accessed November 2015.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personally_identifiable_information#Examples)\n152 [https://www.owasp.org/images/c/c3/Top10PrivacyRisks_IAPP_Summit_2015.pdf, accessed November 2015.](https://www.owasp.org/images/c/c3/Top10PrivacyRisks_IAPP_Summit_2015.pdf)\n153 [http://heartbleed.com/, accessed November 2015.](http://heartbleed.com/)\n154 [http://www.networkworld.com/article/2880366/security0/anthem-hack-personal-data-stolen-sells-for-10x-price-](http://www.networkworld.com/article/2880366/security0/anthem-hack-personal-data-stolen-sells-for-10x-price-of-stolen-credit-card-numbers.html)\n\n[of-stolen-credit-card-numbers.html, accessed November 2015.](http://www.networkworld.com/article/2880366/security0/anthem-hack-personal-data-stolen-sells-for-10x-price-of-stolen-credit-card-numbers.html)\n155 [http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~hamed/papers/PETS2015VPN.pdf, accessed November 2015.](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~hamed/papers/PETS2015VPN.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\n| January 2016\n\nvarious software technology and infrastructure scenarios. Given current drivers in corporate and state\nsponsored cyber-espionage it is obvious that such leakage scenarios are of high relevance[156].\n\n- Often unknown to the owners of various devices, both the device operating system and installed\napplications may transmit data that – if needed – they can be used to identify the owner. In any case,\nthe data collected can serve as an anonymous user profile. By default, for example, mobile phones\ntransmit with every interaction information on version of the operating system, apps and browser\nused, together with (unique) identification number of the device[157], but also cookies and surfing\nhabits. These information bits can be put together to form personalized content and context.\n\n- The large percentage of PII in breached data shows the huge interest of cyber-criminals in this type of\ndata, motivated through its immediate monetization opportunities. Statistics regarding data stolen\nfrom businesses and individuals, show that PII are comprise ca. 70% of stolen/breached information[126].\nNot all breached PIIs have been compromised via information leakage theat. However, given that\ninformation leakage reported as the top cause of breaches[62], it is evident that most of lost PIIs have\nbeen obtained via this cyber-threat.\n\n- Popular leakage channels remained error messages, together with improper time, state and session\nmanagement[158]. In particular, security features, environment, encapsulation, input validation, errors,\ntime and stated, code quality and API abuse are enlisted as top exploits in for the threat of identity\ntheft[158]. In the reporting period exploits abused by this threat have increased. Vendors try to minimize\nleaks in memory management by issuing advisories[159] and/or blogs[160] to be followed by developers.\n\n- Some experts have debated about the importance/impact of information leakage, arguing that if\n“something you have” is being leaked/compromised it is not so bad, as information about “who you\nare” is being leaked. Simply because the former can be replaced, eventually at moderate costs; the\nlatter, however cannot be so easily replaced[117]. Especially if it is connected to biometric characteristics\nof users. In that case it can never be recovered[161].\n\nObserved current trend for this threat: increasing\n\nRelated threats: Identity theft, Web based attacks, Web application attacks, Data Breach.\n\n**Mitigation vector: The mitigation vector for this threat contains the following elements[147,162]:**\n\n- Avoidance of clear-clear text information, especially when stored or on the move.\n\n- Performance of dynamic analysis of application code, both by means of automated or manually\nperformed code scans and input/output behaviour.\n\n156 [http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/the-top-five-cyber-security-vulnerabilities-in-terms-of-potential-for-](http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/the-top-five-cyber-security-vulnerabilities-in-terms-of-potential-for-catastrophic-damage/)\n\n[catastrophic-damage/, accessed November 2015.](http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/the-top-five-cyber-security-vulnerabilities-in-terms-of-potential-for-catastrophic-damage/)\n157 [http://dc.bluecoat.com/Mobile_Malware_Report, accessed November 2015.](http://dc.bluecoat.com/Mobile_Malware_Report)\n158 [http://www8.hp.com/us/en/software-solutions/cyber-risk-report-security-vulnerability/, accessed November](http://www8.hp.com/us/en/software-solutions/cyber-risk-report-security-vulnerability/)\n\n2015.\n159 https://www\n[01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS7K4U_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.base.doc/ae/ctrb_memleakdetection.](https://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS7K4U_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.base.doc/ae/ctrb_memleakdetection.html)\nhtml, accessed November 2015.\n160 [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31351379/how-do-i-fix-a-memory-leak-in-java, accessed November 2015.](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31351379/how-do-i-fix-a-memory-leak-in-java)\n161 [https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-15/materials/us-15-Zhang-Fingerprints-On-Mobile-Devices-Abusing-And-](https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-15/materials/us-15-Zhang-Fingerprints-On-Mobile-Devices-Abusing-And-Leaking-wp.pdf)\n\n[Leaking-wp.pdf, accessed November 2015.](https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-15/materials/us-15-Zhang-Fingerprints-On-Mobile-Devices-Abusing-And-Leaking-wp.pdf)\n162 [https://www.prot-on.com/tips-to-prevent-information-leaks-in-your-company, accessed November 2015.](https://www.prot-on.com/tips-to-prevent-information-leaks-in-your-company)\n\n\n-----\n\n| January 2016\n\n - Performance of static analysis of application code to identify weaknesses in programming.

In this year, ransomware was\nalmost doubled, reaching highest levels ever[112]. This unique increase is attributed to the fact that current\nransomware variants (i.e. CTB-Locker) are difficult to detect and they come together with an aggressive\nphishing campaign that has led to these infection levels[112]. Current versions of ransomware use all\nadvances of anonymization and encryption to successfully hide their traces. The abbreviation CTB in the\nname of CTB-Locker is indicative for the features used within this malware. CTB stands for: Curve referring to elliptic curve crypto, Tor – referring to the anonymization network and B – referring to bitcoin.\nAs shown in the statistics, the ransomware threat hits citizens that are believed to be wealthier, hence\nprimarily from North America and Europe. Ransomware is a counter-example regarding the effectiveness\nof taking down botnets[163]: the takedown of Gameover Zeus has certainly affected the distribution of\nCryptolocker. However, after a relatively short period of a few months we have seen an infection boost\nwith new ransomware generations introducing further technical advantages.\n\nIn the reporting period we have assessed that:\n\n - Defence regarding ransomware should be end-point oriented. This is because just like most of\nmalware, ransomware infections happen at user level. Given that end-point virus protection cannot\ndefend all possible infection vectors related to this threat, additional defences need to be developed.\nNevertheless, focus of defence controls is always the end-user, that is, they need to be end-point\ncentric[164]. This does not mean parallel defences thwarting important cyber-crime infrastructure\ncomponents should left out of focus[165].\n\n - The recovery from a ransomware infection is generally not possible. Encrypted data can only be\nrecovered via the use of cryptographic key used by the malware. And usually this is at the possession\nof the cyber-criminals. In some exceptional cases, successful law enforcement take downs have\nallowed access to cryptographic keys used. In such a case[166], for example, in cooperation with a\n\n163 [http://www.computerworld.com/article/2490343/malware-vulnerabilities/massive-botnet-takedown-stops-](http://www.computerworld.com/article/2490343/malware-vulnerabilities/massive-botnet-takedown-stops-spread-of-cryptolocker-ransomware.html)\n\n[spread-of-cryptolocker-ransomware.html, accessed November 2015.](http://www.computerworld.com/article/2490343/malware-vulnerabilities/massive-botnet-takedown-stops-spread-of-cryptolocker-ransomware.html)\n164 [http://learn.avecto.com/cyber-threats-report-2015, accessed November 2015.](http://learn.avecto.com/cyber-threats-report-2015)\n165 [http://blogs.cisco.com/security/talos/angler-exposed, accessed November 2015.](http://blogs.cisco.com/security/talos/angler-exposed)\n166 [http://thehackernews.com/2015/04/ransomware-removal-decrypt-tool.html, accessed November 2015.](http://thehackernews.com/2015/04/ransomware-removal-decrypt-tool.html)\n\n\n-----\n\n| January 2016\n\nsecurity vendor, a tool has been developed to recover user data[167]. Other examples exist as well[168,169].\nSuch solution are very welcome, yet it is questionable if they are suitable for all kinds of users, i.e. if all\nusers can afford not having access to their data till such a solution is eventually being offered after a\nsuccessful law enforcement operation.\n\n- Besides the fact that total ransomware has doubled in the reporting period, it is interesting to see that\nnew ransomware types appeared in H1 2015 has quadrupled[35]. Crypto-ransomware (i.e. ransomware\nthat encrypts files) has reached almost 50% of all ransomware with an increasing trend[170].\nRansomware campaigns continue targeting wealthy countries, US and Europe hold over 50% of the\ninfections, while 85% of CTB-Locker infections hit in North America and Europe (50% and 35%\nrespectively)[35]. Targets of infection campaigns are end-users (ca. 50%), enterprises (ca. 25%) and small\nbusinesses (ca. 14%)[170]. Recently, a detailed report[171] on CryptoWall has assessed the revenue from a\nsingle ransomware to be some over 300 million $.\n\n- A remarkable novelty that has taken place in 2015 has been the establishment of cooperation among\ncyber-criminals by means of “affiliate programmes”, a sort of crime-ware-as-a-service approach[172]. It\nhas been established/communicated in the context of CTL-Locker ransomware. The idea behind this\nmodel is to contribute with own tools and infrastructure to ransomware campaigns and share the\nprofits. Cyber-security experts argue that the success of CTL-Locker is due to this affiliate\nprogramme[112].\n\n- Future developments expected in the area of ransomware will be made to maximise profit of this\nalready lucrative business. Efforts are going be invested in improving infection rates by combining\navailable infrastructures and establishing alliances through affiliate models. Stealthiness and\nobfuscation methods will be refined while available functions will be combined with existing and new\nvulnerabilities to move to web server sector[173]. Existing approaches are already available and are\nexpected to be part of new ransomware variants, together with advances in encryption methods\nused[174]. Around the end of the reporting period, a new version of CryptoWall has appeared that\nimplements evasion of detection even from second generation firewalls[175]. Finally, due to the fact that\navailable tools to configure and disseminate ransomware are easy to use, less skilled cyber-criminals\nmay use them more efficiently[176]. One can mention hereto an available ransomware-as-a-service tools\nthat have been released and allow everyone to launch a ransomware campaign[177,178].\n\n167 [https://blog.kaspersky.com/coinvault-ransomware-removal-instruction/8363/, accessed November 2015.](https://blog.kaspersky.com/coinvault-ransomware-removal-instruction/8363/)\n168 [http://www.decryptcryptolocker.com/, accessed November 2015.](http://www.decryptcryptolocker.com/)\n169 [http://blogs.cisco.com/security/talos/teslacrypt, accessed November 2015.](http://blogs.cisco.com/security/talos/teslacrypt)\n170 [https://www.trendmicro.com/cloud-content/us/pdfs/security-intelligence/rpt-trendlabs-2015-1q-security-](https://www.trendmicro.com/cloud-content/us/pdfs/security-intelligence/rpt-trendlabs-2015-1q-security-roundup-bad-ads-and-zero-days-reemerging-threats-challenge-tr.pdf)\n\n[roundup-bad-ads-and-zero-days-reemerging-threats-challenge-tr.pdf, accessed November 2015.](https://www.trendmicro.com/cloud-content/us/pdfs/security-intelligence/rpt-trendlabs-2015-1q-security-roundup-bad-ads-and-zero-days-reemerging-threats-challenge-tr.pdf)\n171 [http://cyberthreatalliance.org/cryptowall-report.pdf, accessed November 2015.](http://cyberthreatalliance.org/cryptowall-report.pdf)\n172 [http://www.darkreading.com/partner-perspectives/intel/franchising-ransomware/a/d-id/1321148, accessed](http://www.darkreading.com/partner-perspectives/intel/franchising-ransomware/a/d-id/1321148)\n\nNovember 2015.\n173 [http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/02/03/web_ransomware_scum_now_lay_waste_to_your_backups/, accessed](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/02/03/web_ransomware_scum_now_lay_waste_to_your_backups/)\n\nNovember 2015.\n174 [http://news.softpedia.com/news/researchers-discover-powerful-encryption-capable-ransomware-that-works-](http://news.softpedia.com/news/researchers-discover-powerful-encryption-capable-ransomware-that-works-offline-495747.shtml)\n\n[offline-495747.shtml, accessed November 2015.](http://news.softpedia.com/news/researchers-discover-powerful-encryption-capable-ransomware-that-works-offline-495747.shtml)\n175 [http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/11/09/cryptowall_40/, accessed November 2015.](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/11/09/cryptowall_40/)\n176 [https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2015/05/teslacrypt_followin.html, accessed November 2015.](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2015/05/teslacrypt_followin.html)\n177 [http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/41950/cyber-crime/fakben-ransomware-as-a-service.html, accessed](http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/41950/cyber-crime/fakben-ransomware-as-a-service.html)\n\nNovember 2015.\n178 [http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/39753/cyber-crime/orx-locker-raas.html, accessed November 2015.](http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/39753/cyber-crime/orx-locker-raas.html)\n\n\n-----\n\n| January 2016\n\nObserved current trend for this threat: increasing\n\nRelated threats: Phishing, Spam, Malware, Exploit kits, Botnet, Web based attacks, Web application\nattacks.\n\nAuthoritative Resources 2015: “Bad Ads and Zero Days: Reemerging Threats Challenge Trust in Supply\nChains and Best Practices”, Trend Micro Trend Labs 1Q 2015 Security Roundup[170], “Winning the digital\nsecurity battle: Cyber threat analysis from the Avecto Malware Labs”, AVECTO Whitepaper[164], “Threats\nReport” May 2015 McAfee[112], “Lucrative Ransomware Attacks: Analysis of the CryptoWall Version 3\nThreat”, Cyber Threat Alliance[171].\n\n**Mitigation vector: The mitigation vector for this threat contains the following elements, again not overlap**\nfree with measures mentioned in other cyber-threats:\n\n- Exact definition and implementation of minimum user data access rights in order to minimize the\nimpact of attacks (i.e. less rights, less data encrypted).\n\n\n\n- Availability of back-up schemes that are tested and are in the position to quickly recover user data.\n\n\n\n- Implementation of robust vulnerability and patch management.\n\n\n\n- Implementation of content filtering to filter out unwanted attachments, mails with malicious content,\nspam and unwanted network traffic.\n\n- Installation of end-point protection by means of anti-virus programs but also blocking execution of\nfiles (e.g. block execution in Temp folder).\n\n\n\n- Use of whitelisting to prevent unknown executables from being executed at the end-points.\n\n\n##### Cyber-espionage\n\nCyber-space evolves to the battlefield of the future. Nation states are currently within an arms race w.r.t.\ncyberspace capabilities[179]. In the reporting period, cyber-espionage operations have continue increasing\nand advancing in sophistication. State sponsored operations have made headlines in the reporting period.\nWe would like to highlight few important operations in the area of cyber-espionage, namely the Sony[180]\nand TVMonde[181] attacks, the Bundestag breach, the disclosure of Equation Group activities[182] and the OPM\ndata breach[183]. Although these cyber-espionage cases are just the tip of the iceberg, they take precedence\nover cyber-attack methods and impact:\n\n - The Sony and TV5Monde attacks had a destructive/disruptive impact, as both cases the victim\norganisation was unable to operate for days/weeks due to the cyber-attack.\n\n - The Bundestag hack[184] highlights that physical conflicts as they happened in the Eastern Europe also\nfind their effect in the cyber-world.\n\n - The equation group attack has demonstrated the power of attacks to cyber-physical (i.e. hardware)\nsub-systems.\n\n179 [http://motherboard.vice.com/read/here-are-all-the-sketchy-government-agencies-buying-hacking-teams-spy-](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/here-are-all-the-sketchy-government-agencies-buying-hacking-teams-spy-tech)\n\ntech, accessed November 2015.\n180 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Pictures_Entertainment_hack, accessed December 2015.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Pictures_Entertainment_hack)\n181 [http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-33072034, accessed December 2015.](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-33072034)\n182 [https://securelist.com/files/2015/02/Equation_group_questions_and_answers.pdf, accessed November 2015.](https://securelist.com/files/2015/02/Equation_group_questions_and_answers.pdf)\n183 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Personnel_Management_data_breach, accessed November 2015.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Personnel_Management_data_breach)\n184 [http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/37535/cyber-crime/russians-hacked-bundestag.html, accessed December](http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/37535/cyber-crime/russians-hacked-bundestag.html)\n\n2015.\n\n\n-----\n\n| January 2016\n\n- The OPM hack has led to a loss (and eventually misuse) of biometric information of a large number of\nUS public servants, a loss that cannot be recovered, as this information is unique.\n\nAnother interesting consequence of cyber-espionage is related to the blurriness in the limits between\nstate-sponsored and industrial espionage: when big multinational players are involved, national\ncapabilities may be used in campaigns involving hostile activist groups, competitors, and industrial\nespionage[120]. The grey area between state-sponsored (i.e. Advanced Persistent Threat – APT) and targeted\ncampaigns (i.e. targeted attacks/advanced targeted attacks) is subject of discussions[185,186,187]. Following the\npractice of other key cyber-security players[43,85,200], we consider targeted attacks as being part of this\nthreat, though knowing that not all targeted attacks may have espionage background. Considering\ntargeted attacks as being part of this cyber-threat, leads to further enlargement the scope of cyberespionage, establishing thus an overlap with activities of other threat agents[188,43].\n\nIn the reporting period we have assessed that:\n\n- Though being assumed for some years now[189], in 2015 the cyber security community has encountered\na case where manipulations are made persistent by hiding themselves in embedded software, that is,\nin firmware or hardware-device programming[182]. This incident has impacted the cyber-security\ncommunity because it adds a new quality to cyber-attacks: they are very difficult to detect and survive\noperating system re-installation. In other words, the most efficient remediation of this attack would be\nto replace affected devices. Some similar attacks have been developed by researchers to demonstrate\nways to hide malicious code in hardware[190]. On the other hand, this threat shows that there is no\ndevice that can be considered as trusted[191]. And it unveils the potential risks that are behind cyberphysical systems, i.e. systems making up the transition from the cyber to the physical world[192]. Though\nnot new[193,194,195], this threat appears in a totally new context when seen in combination with\ninterconnected applications and anonymization network/services. In times of increasing\ninteroperability and integration of devices and services, this fact may have an impact that exceeds\n\n185 [http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/targeted-attacks-versus-apts-whats-the-difference/,](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/targeted-attacks-versus-apts-whats-the-difference/)\n\naccessed November 2015.\n186 [http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/40228/cyber-crime/targeted-attacks-vs-advanced-persistent-threats.html,](http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/40228/cyber-crime/targeted-attacks-vs-advanced-persistent-threats.html)\n\naccessed November 2015.\n187 [https://www2.fireeye.com/ciso-guide-next-generation-threats.html?x=FE_WEB_IC, accessed November 2015.](https://www2.fireeye.com/ciso-guide-next-generation-threats.html?x=FE_WEB_IC)\n188 Knowing that targeted attacks are used also outside espionage campaigns, we dedicate in this report two special\n\nchapters with analysis of attack vectors used within APT and targeted attacks.\n189 [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/11416985/Millions-of-computers-may-be-](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/11416985/Millions-of-computers-may-be-compromised-by-US-spyware-report.html)\n\n[compromised-by-US-spyware-report.html, accessed November 2015.](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/11416985/Millions-of-computers-may-be-compromised-by-US-spyware-report.html)\n190 [http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/05/gpu-based-rootkit-and-keylogger-offer-superior-stealth-and-computing-](http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/05/gpu-based-rootkit-and-keylogger-offer-superior-stealth-and-computing-power/)\n\npower/, accessed November 2015.\n[191http://www.iisp.gatech.edu/sites/default/files/documents/2016_georgiatech_cyberthreatsreport_onlinescroll.pdf,](http://www.iisp.gatech.edu/sites/default/files/documents/2016_georgiatech_cyberthreatsreport_onlinescroll.pdf)\n\naccessed November 2015.\n192 [http://dp8hsntg6do36.cloudfront.net/55ad80d461646d4db7000005/531bc5de-3185-49d1-ae1d-](http://dp8hsntg6do36.cloudfront.net/55ad80d461646d4db7000005/531bc5de-3185-49d1-ae1d-2e4acb580efelow.mp4)\n\n[2e4acb580efelow.mp4, accessed November 2015.](http://dp8hsntg6do36.cloudfront.net/55ad80d461646d4db7000005/531bc5de-3185-49d1-ae1d-2e4acb580efelow.mp4)\n193 [http://www.darkreading.com/risk-management/intelligence-agencies-banned-lenovo-pcs-after-chinese-](http://www.darkreading.com/risk-management/intelligence-agencies-banned-lenovo-pcs-after-chinese-acquisition/d/d-id/1110950)\n\n[acquisition/d/d-id/1110950?, accessed November 2015.](http://www.darkreading.com/risk-management/intelligence-agencies-banned-lenovo-pcs-after-chinese-acquisition/d/d-id/1110950)\n194 [http://www.bbc.com/news/business-19879864, accessed November 2015.](http://www.bbc.com/news/business-19879864)\n195 [http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-navy-looks-to-replace-ibm-servers-for-security-after-lenovo-purchase-](http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-navy-looks-to-replace-ibm-servers-for-security-after-lenovo-purchase-1432047582)\n\n[1432047582, accessed November 2015.](http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-navy-looks-to-replace-ibm-servers-for-security-after-lenovo-purchase-1432047582)\n\n\n-----\n\n| January 2016\n\nexpectations of all involved roles in cyber-space. And it will keep a lot of actors in IT busy for the\ncoming years[196,197,198].\n\n- If one makes the extreme, yet not fully irrelevant assumption, that no device is un-hackable, the issue\nof secure storage/secure device comes into a new light. And given the fact that data stored in such\nstorages is usually of very high value/confidentiality, one can easily assess the impact of such losses. In\nthe reporting period, a data breach of biometric data[161,183] has shown the potential of high capability\nactors such as cyber-espionage. Such breaches are indicative for other trusted devices that are needed\nin order to perform critical services, such as e-health systems, smart grids, industrial control, etc.\n\n- Targeted attacks are an important vector during initial phases of infiltration. They are usually\nmaterialized through spear-phishing attacks. These are targeted phishing attacks that are customized\nto reach a specific user community. The customization is implemented by means of social engineering\nand especially crafted malware[43,120]. In 2015 spear-phishing attacks have become more targeted: while\ntheir number was increasing, the number of mails per campaign was reduced. Probably this is an\nindication about narrower victim groups[43], and thus bigger specialization[199]. From the efficiency point\nof view, it is argued that spear-phishing attacks may bring 10 times the revenue of one thousand\nphishing mails[200].\n\n- Statistics are indicative for the high potential behind this threat and the high level of exposure\norganisations have: the majority of incidents regarding this threat had no attribution[85]. This is\nindicative for the relatively low risk/likelihood of involved threat agents to be caught. Expectedly, top\ntypes of industries being targeted are manufacturing, public administration, professional, information\nand utilities[85]. The types of threat agents involved in cyber-espionage are: state-sponsored 87%,\norganised crime ca. 1%, competitor ca. 1% and former employees ca. 1%[201]. Looking at the installation\nvectors underlines the key role of spear-phishing: top three infection methods used in cyber-espionage\nare e-mail attachment, malicious e-mail link, and drive-by attack. They cover ca. 85% of the cases!\nFinally, it is worth mentioning that cyber-espionage is at the third position impact-wise, whereas for\nsmall-medium-businesses holds the first position[202].\n\n- Obviously, zero-day vulnerabilities are a very strong tool in the hands agents with advanced\ncapabilities and as such very desirable.

Threat Agents\n\n##### Threat agent models\n\nAs regards threat agents, in the reporting year one has to repeat conclusions of the past: the issue is rather\nunder-illuminated. In 2015, some important players in cyber-security have come to the same conclusion,\nasking for a better analysis of threat agents and better attribution of cyber-incidents[214].\n\nOne should wonder, however, if and which organisations may be in the position to improve attribution of\nincidents. While the capability maturity regarding this task is surely rather low in many organisations, some\nvendors may be in the position to support. Yet, costs and impact from analysis of the incident and the\nattribution are two factors that might be the spoilsports. How much are the costs of forensic analysis? Can\ncompanies afford paying someone to support in attribution? What to do with the results? A critical mass\non experience in these areas will be necessary in order for decision makers to proceed with incident\nattribution.\n\nBefore going to attribution, it is argued that the cyber-security community needs to understand the\nwhereabouts of the threat agents out there. And this involves many aspects, starting from proactive\nactivities, such as threat agent modelling, to reactive ones, mainly related to attribution of incidents or\nanalysis of currently active threat agent groups. In the reporting period, some progress has been made in\nboth areas. This progress can be summarised as follows:\n\n    - A remarkable contribution to threat agent modelling has been assessed my means of a detailed\nanalysis of threat agent motivation. This work provides strong incentives about drivers behind threat\nagents and helps understanding their rationale[215]. This is considered as a contribution to proactive\nthreat agent identification.\n\n    - Some other contributions in the area identification of contemporary threat agents have been\npublished in scientific[216], media[217] and other[218] publications. These have analysed online/real-time\ninformation found in underground fora, chat rooms and market places and draw conclusions about\nbehaviour of cyber-criminals.\n\n    - Finally, significant information has been found on the topic of insider threat. Incidents caused by\ninsiders have been analysed and more detail insights into the structure and motivations of this threat\nagent group have been published. This is also a result of reactiveness, that is, “ex post” analysis of\nincidents[97].\n\nGiven these developments, in this chapter we discuss the current stay-of-play in analysis of cyber threat\nagents and provide a short discussion including proactive vs. reactive considerations. The current situation\nin threat agent analysis is graphically represented in the following picture:\n\n214 [https://www.f-secure.com/documents/996508/1030743/Threat_Report_H2_2014, accessed November 2015.](https://www.f-secure.com/documents/996508/1030743/Threat_Report_H2_2014)\n215 [http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/white-papers/understanding-cyberthreat-](http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/white-papers/understanding-cyberthreat-motivations-to-improve-defense-paper.pdf)\n\n[motivations-to-improve-defense-paper.pdf, accessed November 2015.](http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/white-papers/understanding-cyberthreat-motivations-to-improve-defense-paper.pdf)\n216 [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=7165944&filter%3DAND(p_IS_Number%3A7165923),](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=7165944&filter%3DAND(p_IS_Number%3A7165923))\n\naccessed November 2015.\n217 [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/internet-security/11568376/Unmasked-the-six-hacker-tribes-you-need-](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/internet-security/11568376/Unmasked-the-six-hacker-tribes-you-need-to-watch-out-for.html)\n\n[to-watch-out-for.html, accessed November 2015.](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/internet-security/11568376/Unmasked-the-six-hacker-tribes-you-need-to-watch-out-for.html)\n218 [http://www.iss.europa.eu/uploads/media/Brief_2_cyber_jihad.pdf, accessed November 2015.](http://www.iss.europa.eu/uploads/media/Brief_2_cyber_jihad.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\n| January 2016\n\n**Threat agent** **Threat agent**\n**Threat agent models**\n**information collection** **attribution**\n\n**Online** **Offline** **Law**\n**TA-Taxonomy** **TA-Motivation** **TA-Capability** **(dark web, social media)** **(print, broadcasting)** **Forensics** **enforcement** **Detection**\n\n**Proactive** **Real/near time** **Reactive**\n\n###### Comprehensive threat agent knowledge\n\n**Figure 4: Content of comprehensive threat agent knowledge**\n\nTurning this figure to words it means that comprehensive knowledge about threat agents would consist or\nthree categories of knowledge:\n\n- _Proactive knowledge, consisting of a threat agent model covering all relevant parameters, such as_\ndistinct threat agent groups, capabilities and skills, motivation, interactions/interrelationships among\nthe groups, etc. Purpose of this knowledge is to be taken into account during threat or risk\nassessments in order to evaluate threat exposure of assets. The current state-of-play with regard such\nknowledge is rather initial. Besides a well-developed threat agent model[219], no much open source\ninformation has been found in 2015. We believe that this area deserves further elaboration.\n\n- _Real/near-time knowledge, consists of contemporary information collected from online sources (web,_\ndark web, social media, etc.), print and broadcasting media. Existing approaches found demonstrate\nresults from the dark web[216]. However, information on this matter, if existing, it is kept confidential,\ni.e. it might not be widely accessible as open source information. Examples of this knowledge are\ninstitutions of which stolen credit cards are being offered online. This kind of knowledge would be very\nuseful for both security operations and security planning and threat/risk assessment. The unavailability\nof this knowledge is barrier vis-à-vis its wider use. In this field the state-of-play can be characterised as\ninitial too. A lot more need to be done with regard to methods and tools for information and\nknowledge discovery in the dark net.\n\n- _Reactive knowledge is an outcome of analysis of incidents that have gone through successful_\nattribution. Reactive knowledge helps understanding threat agent groups, their motivations and attack\nmethods and is provided by vendors, law enforcement organisations or security agencies after analysis\nof security incidents. Though some of the incidents in the reporting year have led to\nattributions/arrests (indicatively[220,221222]), not much is known about the involved threat agents.\nNonetheless, in 2015 significant consolidated information about insider threat has been published by\n\n219 [https://communities.intel.com/servlet/JiveServlet/previewBody/1151-102-1-](https://communities.intel.com/servlet/JiveServlet/previewBody/1151-102-1-1111/Threat%20Agent%20Library_07-2202w.pdf)\n\n[1111/Threat%20Agent%20Library_07-2202w.pdf, accessed November 2015.](https://communities.intel.com/servlet/JiveServlet/previewBody/1151-102-1-1111/Threat%20Agent%20Library_07-2202w.pdf)\n220 [http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/talktalk-cyber-attack-fourth-person-arrested-over-hack-](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/talktalk-cyber-attack-fourth-person-arrested-over-hack-a6720331.html)\n\n[a6720331.html, accessed November 2015.](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/talktalk-cyber-attack-fourth-person-arrested-over-hack-a6720331.html)\n221 [http://edition.cnn.com/2015/10/15/politics/malaysian-hacker-isis-military-data/, accessed November 2015.](http://edition.cnn.com/2015/10/15/politics/malaysian-hacker-isis-military-data/)\n222 [http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-34504317, accessed November 2015.](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-34504317)\n\n\n-----\n\n| January 2016\n\nsome vendors [96,100,103]. Information about insiders and their motivation have led to detailed knowledge\nof this group. Reactive threat agent knowledge would be very useful for threat/risk assessment and\nsecurity operations. The area of reactive knowledge needs further elaboration too. Though some\ninformation exists in this field, lessons learned by attributed incidents are not collected and\nsystematically maintained. It would be very beneficial if a central repository with lessons learned by\nanalysed incidents would be made available to security professionals.\n\nConcluding, one may again underline the importance of threat agent knowledge for the threat landscape\nand in particular in threat and risk assessment. Advancements in this area would be another step towards\nfacilitation of proper development of defences to cyber-threats. These advancements should go hand in\nhand with a better incorporation of threat agent knowledge at all levels of planning and operation of\nsecurity controls (i.e. methods, processes and tools). Certainly an interesting task for research and\nstandardisation organisations.\n\n##### Overview of threat agents\n\nThreat agent activities and published material found in the reporting period allow for a more\ndetailed/precise threat agent knowledge. This is the case for some of the threat agent groups mentioned\nin previous ETLs, in particular cyber-criminals, insiders, hacktivists and cyber-spies. Obviously, these are the\nthreat agent types mostly analysed/discussed in 2015 and are allegedly top initiators of cyberincidents[223,85]. In this section we will concentrate on the threat groups where some developments have\nbeen documented, while threat groups with less dynamics will not be further developed. With this method\nwe aim at keeping the length of this ETL moderate and avoid redundancies. Interested readers may refer\nto ETL2014[224] for additional information on the threat groups.\n\nBefore going into the whereabouts of each threat agent group, overall trends should be taken into\naccount. Some important trends of the threat landscape that have explicit influence of threat agent\nactivities are:\n\n  - _Consumerisation of cyber-crime: the offering of inexpensive cyber-crime services is a reality. Prices for_\nstolen data and for cyber-crime-as-a-service are in a falling trend (see also 3.10). Cyber-crime\n“franchising” with affiliate programmes have been seen in the wild[172]. Ransomware as-a-service is\nanother impressive example of the consumerisation trend[177]. Even code signing certificates have\nbecome important tool for malicious applications[225]. Cyber threat agents are in the position to achieve\nmaximum impact at low prices. This increases the risk level.\n\n  - _Low entry level barriers for technically novices: it was never easier to launch a ransomware campaign,_\nto make a successful SQL injection or to launch a phishing campaign[226]. These are strong fact towards\nenabling motivated[215] individuals to become cyber-criminals at any time[227].\n\n  - _Level of exploitation of dark net: the dark net and dark web reminds currently the internet of the 90s:_\nit is used only by geeks and the access to it requires some technical knowledge. In addition to that, the\ncontent of dark web is considered as evil and some technical obstacles have been implemented to demotivate untrusted visitors sniffing in their business[216]. This reduces the possibility to “harness” dark\n\n223 [http://www.hackmageddon.com/category/security/cyber-attacks-statistics/, accessed November 2015.](http://www.hackmageddon.com/category/security/cyber-attacks-statistics/)\n224 [https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-landscape/enisa-threat-landscape-2014/at_download/fullReport)\n\n[landscape/enisa-threat-landscape-2014/at_download/fullReport, accessed November 2015.](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-landscape/enisa-threat-landscape-2014/at_download/fullReport)\n225 [http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/40866/cyber-crime/code-signing-certificates.html, accessed November 2015.](http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/40866/cyber-crime/code-signing-certificates.html)\n226 [http://siliconangle.com/blog/2015/10/27/15-year-old-script-kiddie-arrested-in-talktalk-hacking-investigation/,](http://siliconangle.com/blog/2015/10/27/15-year-old-script-kiddie-arrested-in-talktalk-hacking-investigation/)\n\naccessed November 2015.\n227 [http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/25-ways-to-become-the-ultimate-script-kiddie/, assessed November 2015.](http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/25-ways-to-become-the-ultimate-script-kiddie/)\n\n\n-----\n\n| January 2016\n\nweb. At the same time, information discovery in dark web is far behind compared to that of the\ninternet. These are negative factors allowing dark web to be hideout of threat agents.\n\n- _Low rates of attributions: it is still difficult to get the bad guys in cyber-space[191]. Attribution levels in_\ncyber-space are very encouraging for threat agents. In many thousands of (known) incidents, data\nbreaches and after huge amounts of profit, only a few attributions have been made. And in cases of\nespionage, almost none has been arrested. This makes threat agents in cyber-space one of the\nprofessions with relatively low risks[228].\n\nBefore going into the details of threat agent groups, one might observe an overlap among some threats\nand threat agent groups used (e.g. insider threat vs. insider agent, or cyber espionage threat vs. cyber spy\nagents). This is not necessarily a redundancy content-wise: while in the threats we refer to the means with\nwhich threats are deployed (e.g. tools, methods, vectors), in the threat agents we refer more to\nmotivations and capabilities.\n\nAccording to incident statistics, top threat agent groups in 2015 are: cyber-criminals (including online social\nhackers), insiders, hacktivists, cyber-spies (nation states and corporations) and cyber warriors[223].Taking\ninto account all above trends and developments in the area of threat agents, new details assessed for the\nthreat agents are:\n\n**Cyber-criminals: While the description of this threat group from last year is still valid totally[224], one can**\nmention some additional facts regarding this group. Firstly it should be noted that operated\ninfrastructures, malicious tools / software and attack methods have continue advancing[229230]. Obfuscation\n(non-exhaustively)[231,232,233] and hiding of viral high potential and high effort servers has advanced too[234].\nMoreover, collaboration patterns such as affiliate programmes enhance the spread and depth of\nperformed attacks[112]. Their motivation is mainly based on monetisation. This makes them perfect\n“candidates” for what has been reported as “espionage-as-a-service”[217]; some information found attests\nparticipation of ca. 10% of cyber-crime in espionage campaigns[201]. It is worth mentioning that information\navailable on this threat agent seem to be primarily product of proactive (i.e. modelling) and secondarily of\nreactive approaches (i.e. analysis of incidents). A more balanced quality covering all three possible\napproaches would increase the value of information on this threat group.\n\n**Insiders (Employees): Insiders are a pretty well analysed threat agent group in the reporting period. The**\nclassification within this group has been made more detailed. Available classification of insider foresees\nthe following insiders: current and former employees, current and former providers / contractors /\nconsultants, current and former suppliers and business partners and customers[98].

This means that bypassing existing restrictive settings (eventually security\ncontrols) is a main reason for misuse of privileged accounts. Another interesting finding regarding this\nthreat agent group is that most often misused credentials are those of end-users/customers, cashiers,\nfinance and executives are following. Sys-admins are actually very low at ca. 9[th] position[85]. An additional\nrisk that has to be encountered regarding insiders, is the interest other threat agent groups might have to\n“recruit” insiders for their malicious purposes, eventually through monetization[235]. Current information on\ninsider threat agents originates partially from reactive analysis of related incidents and mainly from\nmodelling. A significant resource of insider threat agent is CERT SEI Carnegie Mellon University[236], besides\ndedicated product/tool offerings[237]. All in all, investigation and protection against this threat agent group\nhas reached a good maturity.\n\n**Online social hackers: Online social hacking has continue increasing in 2015. This is due to the increased**\nrole of phishing attacks that are specially crafted for a certain target group[238]. Information from social\nnetworking delivers important information to this attack vector[239]. Given that necessary tools for this kind\nof attacks are widely available[240], it is very easy for motivated individuals to take over this role.\nNevertheless, highly sophisticated social engineering attacks can be deployed[241]. Available knowledge\nregarding this group is based on reactive approaches, that is, is based on analysis of incidents.\n\n**Cyber spies (Nation states, Corporations): This threat agent group has not changed with regard to**\nmotivation and course of actions[242,243]. There have been interesting developments in the capabilities of this\ngroup. It is very interesting to see advances in attack vectors used, as those will affect defence strategies in\nthe future. The highlight of these advancements is the expansion of the attack surface to include cyberphysical systems[191]. This tactic will reduce traceability of attacks and will enhance efforts to recover from\nsuch attacks[33]; as such it is a real breakthrough. It is expected that defences are going to be developed in\nthis area[244]. After being aware of these tactics, the cyber-security community has identified various other\nimpressive methods to abuse cyber-physical properties of systems[245].

They continue hacking and disseminating information from organizations or people in\npower in order to embarrass them and to raise public awareness about alleged wrongdoings. They\npromote freedom of expression and openness of internet. Some campaigns have been assessed during this\nyear[247,248] that fully comply with the activism attitude of this threat agent group. Some discussion/protests\nhave taken place regarding the legal practice of sentencing hacktivists with the same rules as terrorists[249].\nIt was interesting to see Anonymous in the reporting period starting an operation against ISIS by defacing\njihadist web sites and identifying 10.000 twitter and Facebook accounts used for ISIS recruitment\npurposes[250]. A similar announcement has been done with regard to the terroristic attacks in Paris[251], an\nevent that may lead to a sort of “alliance” between hacktivists and security agencies[252]. In such campaigns,\nhacktivists turn having same targets as nation states, a fact that apparently does not always pleases the\nnations involved in such conflicts. However, to team up with hacktivists against a common target might be\na viable reinforcement of striking power in cyber-space[253]. Finally, assessment shows that hacktivist groups\nmay shift their focus and start a profession by means of commercial offerings stemming from activist\nexperience[254].\n\n**Cyber fighters: Being nationally motivated, threat agents from this group may move in the interstellar**\nspace between cyber terrorists, activists and espionage. Recent announcements about Syrian Electronic\nArmy, for example deliver evidence about this[255]: key players assumed behind this organisation still have\nor had close relationships to the Syrian government. A similar situation is assumed for groups like Yemen\nCyber Army and Iranian Cyber Army[256]. Another interesting attack that has been encountered was\nmotivated by terroristic attack at Charlie Hebdo[257]. The activities of the group can be assigned somewhere\nbetween this threat agent group and cyber-terrorists.\n\n246 [http://www.techtimes.com/articles/94188/20151013/china-arrested-hackers-on-us-request-cyberespionage-](http://www.techtimes.com/articles/94188/20151013/china-arrested-hackers-on-us-request-cyberespionage-tension-defused.htm)\n\n[tension-defused.htm, accessed November 2015.](http://www.techtimes.com/articles/94188/20151013/china-arrested-hackers-on-us-request-cyberespionage-tension-defused.htm)\n247 [http://www.dw.com/en/anonymous-hacktivist-explains-why-group-is-targeting-saudi-arabian-government/a-](http://www.dw.com/en/anonymous-hacktivist-explains-why-group-is-targeting-saudi-arabian-government/a-18758195)\n\n18758195, accessed November 2015.\n248 [http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/nov/06/anonymous-ku-klux-klan-name-leak, accessed November](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/nov/06/anonymous-ku-klux-klan-name-leak)\n\n2015.\n249 [http://www.commondreams.org/news/2015/02/03/jailed-anonymous-hacktivist-was-watchlisted-fbi-arrest,](http://www.commondreams.org/news/2015/02/03/jailed-anonymous-hacktivist-was-watchlisted-fbi-arrest)\n\naccessed November 2015.\n250 [http://thecryptosphere.com/2015/03/20/anonymous-vs-isis-the-ongoing-skirmishes-of-opisis/, accessed](http://thecryptosphere.com/2015/03/20/anonymous-vs-isis-the-ongoing-skirmishes-of-opisis/)\n\nNovember 2015.\n251 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w49NCXhq0YI, accessed November 2015.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w49NCXhq0YI)\n252 [http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/netzpolitik/anonymous-wie-hacker-die-is-propaganda-ausschalten-wollen-a-](http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/netzpolitik/anonymous-wie-hacker-die-is-propaganda-ausschalten-wollen-a-1063067.html)\n\n[1063067.html, accessed November 2015.](http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/netzpolitik/anonymous-wie-hacker-die-is-propaganda-ausschalten-wollen-a-1063067.html)\n253 [http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/isis-us-government-should-team-anonymous-fight-islamic-state-1490446, accessed](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/isis-us-government-should-team-anonymous-fight-islamic-state-1490446)\n\nNovember 2015.\n254 [http://ghostsecuritygroup.com/, accessed November 2015.](http://ghostsecuritygroup.com/)\n255 [http://motherboard.vice.com/read/the-syrian-electronic-armys-most-dangerous-hack, accessed November 2015.](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/the-syrian-electronic-armys-most-dangerous-hack)\n256 [http://motherboard.vice.com/read/theres-evidence-the-yemen-cyber-army-is-actually-iranian, accessed](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/theres-evidence-the-yemen-cyber-army-is-actually-iranian)\n\nNovember 2015.\n257 [http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-30850702, accessed November 2015.](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-30850702)\n\n\n-----\n\n| January 2016\n\n**Cyber terrorists: In this reporting period we have seen ISIS coming into the landscape. National security**\nand cyber experts try to assess their striking power in the cyber space[258,259]. It has to be noted that the use\nof modern internet technology has been established as a communication channel and as channel for\nrecruitment, and is being build up constantly[218,260]. To this extend, they have acted rather as social online\nhackers (see threat agent group above). Nonetheless, it seems that ISIS is trying to employ hackers to\nmaintain their social networking infrastructure, that is, to operate the recruitment campaigns over social\nnetworks. Moreover, like other malicious agents, terrorists are interested in anonymous financial\ntransaction both for collecting and distributing money[261]. This makes them acquiring resources to manage\nthis task. Yet, terrorists using the internet for their purposes does not equals cyber-terrorism. However, by\nincreasingly engaging in cyber-space and give the availability of cyber-crime-as-a-service, one can assume\nthat they would be in the position to launch cyber-attacks. At the time being, experts do not believe ISIS\nmight have significant cyber-terrorist capabilities.\n\n**Script kiddies: It is obvious that a lot of information is available in the internet to allow for launching cyber-**\nattacks. Currently, available services make it easy to launch attacks[262,263], create own malware and\nransomware. Through the increased consumerization of cyber-crime, this threat agent group might get\ninvolved in more security incidents. This developments bear increased risks that young individuals might\nbe engaged in hacking just for the fun of it. Or even cause cyber incidents with unknown outcomes. This is\na reality that might attract not only kids. In the reporting period we have assessed a major incident\nallegedly caused by a teenager (i.e. TalkTalk data breach)[264]. Cyber-security communities try through\ncompetitions to channel available hacking skills to positive directions[265]. These are internationally welcome\ninitiatives that go at the right direction[266].\n\nThe figure below is an evolution of ETL2014[32] and shows and overview of threat agent groups by covering\ndevelopments assessed in 2015.\n\n258 [http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/12/isis-cyber-caliphate-hacking-technology-arms-race, accessed](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/12/isis-cyber-caliphate-hacking-technology-arms-race)\n\nNovember 2015.\n259 [http://www.govtech.com/blogs/lohrmann-on-cybersecurity/Cyber-Terrorism-How-Dangerous-is-the-ISIS-Cyber-](http://www.govtech.com/blogs/lohrmann-on-cybersecurity/Cyber-Terrorism-How-Dangerous-is-the-ISIS-Cyber-Caliphate-Threat.html)\n\n[Caliphate-Threat.html, accessed November 2015.](http://www.govtech.com/blogs/lohrmann-on-cybersecurity/Cyber-Terrorism-How-Dangerous-is-the-ISIS-Cyber-Caliphate-Threat.html)\n260 [https://news.siteintelgroup.com/Jihadist-News/is-supporter-suggests-method-to-avoid-twitter-suspension.html,](https://news.siteintelgroup.com/Jihadist-News/is-supporter-suggests-method-to-avoid-twitter-suspension.html)\n\naccessed November 2015.\n261 [http://www.dw.com/en/bitcoin-islamic-states-online-currency-venture/a-18724856, accessed November 2015.](http://www.dw.com/en/bitcoin-islamic-states-online-currency-venture/a-18724856)\n262 [http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/25-ways-to-become-the-ultimate-script-kiddie/, accessed November 2015.](http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/25-ways-to-become-the-ultimate-script-kiddie/)\n263 [http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/07/advanced-spyware-for-android-now-available-to-script-kiddies-](http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/07/advanced-spyware-for-android-now-available-to-script-kiddies-everywhere/)\n\n[everywhere/, accessed November 2015.](http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/07/advanced-spyware-for-android-now-available-to-script-kiddies-everywhere/)\n264 [http://siliconangle.com/blog/2015/10/27/15-year-old-script-kiddie-arrested-in-talktalk-hacking-investigation/,](http://siliconangle.com/blog/2015/10/27/15-year-old-script-kiddie-arrested-in-talktalk-hacking-investigation/)\n\naccessed November 2015.\n265 [http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/10/23/european_cyber_security_challenge_2015/, accessed November 2015.](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/10/23/european_cyber_security_challenge_2015/)\n266 [https://haxogreen.lu/, accessed November 2015.](https://haxogreen.lu/)\n\n\n-----\n\n| January 2016\n\n\n**Scrip Kiddies**\n\n\n**Cyber Agent**\n\n\n**Group/Category**\n\n**Individual Agent**\n\n**Group**\n\nSector, Capability, Motive\n\nExamples of concurrent roles\n\n**Legend**\n\n\nYoung, unskilled\n\n**Cyber Agent** **Low Tech/**\n\n**Low-Medium**\n\nSoft skilled\n\n**Expertise**\n\nInternal,\n\n**Hostile** low/medium- skilled\n**(intentional)**\n(Threat Agent) Low\n\ncapability\n\n**Provider/**\n\nHigh **High Tech/** Infrastructure **Developer/**\ncapability **High Expertise** delivery **Operator**\n\nInfrastructure **Tools User/**\n\nuse **Deployer**\n\n**Figure 5: A proactive model as overview of threat agents**\n\n\n**Cyber Agent**\n\n\nConcluding the discussion on threat agent groups, one should underline again the need to invest efforts in\nthe area of proactive, real/near time and reactive approaches to threat agent identification.\n\nMoreover, we believe that it might be very beneficial to consider how friendly cyber-agent/action groups\nmight be created and mobilized to play an active role in cyber-defence. Drawing parallels to civil\nprotection, it is argued that the cyber-security community should consider mobilizing voluntary groups of\ncitizens willing to participate in national cyber-defence initiatives. Besides the feasibility of\nimplementation, the mode and roles of potential involvement of action groups could be examined. Such\nan activity would be part of the countermeasure to cyber-threats putting the society at risk.\n\n##### Threat Agents and top threats\n\nThe involvement of the above threat agents in the deployment of the identified top threats is presented in\nthe table below (see Table 2). The purpose of this table is to visualize which threat agent groups are\ninvolve in which threats.

Colours indicate primary and secondary involvement of threat agent group in\nthe threat.\n\n\n-----\n\n| January 2016\n\n### 5. Attack vectors\n\nAll of the assessed cyber-threats are launched by means of a “workflow” that consists of the steps\nattackers undertake to materialize the threat. This workflow is called attack vector. An attack vector may\nbe composed of one or more threats, while some steps of the attack may not be malicious at all. They may,\nfor example, consist of reconnaissance, access to available services with the purpose of profiling, luring to\nvisit a site, making fake offers, etc. One can say that while cyber-threats describe the “what”, attack\nvectors provide information about the “how” of a cyber-attack.\n\nThe information regarding an attack vector is just as intuitive as the definition of risk: a threat agent uses\ntools (i.e. cyber-threats) to abuse weakness of some assets, thus obtaining access to these assets with the\nfinal aim to achieve their malicious objectives (illegal profit/fraud, theft of valuable data, sabotage, etc.).\nAttack vectors consist of steps. Each step might include an asset, its weakness/vulnerability, the tool to\nexploit the vulnerability and move forward to the next assets with the final consequence of a successful\nattack.\n\nWe consider attack vector as being of great importance in the understanding the modus operandi of cyberthreat agents. Having this information, defenders will be in the position to understand the details of the\nattack and put in place defences to eliminate vulnerabilities, eventually by implementing some security\ncontrols or adapting existing ones.\n\nInformation-wise, attack vectors greatly overlap with kill-chains. Kill-chains provide a generic classification\nscheme that can accommodate the method of an attack. Given the use of kill-chains within ENISA threat\nlandscapes, we still use kill-chains as a reference model to describe attack vectors. In assessed reports,\nattack vectors are also explained via graphical means, this is a very useful and intuitive way to represent\nattack vectors.\n\nIn this ETL three attack vectors have been analysed, namely i) attacks against cyber-physical systems, ii)\nadvanced persistent threat (APT) attacks and iii) targeted attacks. These three attack types have been\nselected because they are very prevalent and combine some threats as the deployed from high capability\nthreat-agents. As such are good examples to understand attack tactics and eventually adapt appropriate\ndefences.\n\nFor the description below we use some elements to structure presentations: Description is a generic\ndescription of the attack; relation to kill-chain shows how the attack unfolds; specializations describe\nattack variants found; existing sources provides with references to sources found: finally a list of involved\nthreat agents is provided.\n\n##### Attacks against cyber physical systems\n\n_Description: “A cyber-physical system (CPS), also referred to as “smart systems”, is a system of_\n_collaborating computational elements controlling physical entities. Unlike more traditional embedded_\n_systems, a full-fledged CPS is typically designed as a network of interacting elements with physical input_\n_and output instead of as standalone device”.[267] Through the developments in industrial systems[268], the_\namount of devices, services, connectivity, integration and diversity within CPS is constantly growing.\nBesides multiple devices, many different systems and supporting processes for industrial automation,\nhome control, smart grids, smart transportation, etc. are part of CPS. One can argue that CPS is the\n\n267 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyber-physical_system, accessed November 2015.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyber-physical_system)\n268 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry_4.0, accessed November 2015.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry_4.0)\n\n\n-----\n\n| January 2016\n\nindustrially oriented Internet of Things. This diversity makes CPS prone to various kinds of attacks[269]. Due\nto the role of such industrial, medical or home environments, a successful attack will have severe impact.\n\nCPS structure implies that successful attacks targeting a part of CPS systems will affect a wider range of\ncomponents/functions but also possibly managed physical phenomena. This might have severe\neconomical, health and environmental losses. Objective of CPS attacks encountered in the reporting period\nwere not data exfiltration and data breach. They were primarily targeting manipulation of engineered\nsystems in order to affect the processes. Data exfiltration and leakage were secondary objectives. On the\nlong term, however, it is estimated that offenders may manipulate sensors to affect integrity of\ninput/output with the objective to achieve physical damage[244].\n\n_Relation to kill-chain: Attacks on CPS will need to explore weaknesses of all involved components, including_\nparts of the processes of the managed physical phenomena. Such weaknesses may be related to software\nor hardware assets, but also physical and human aspects. The reconnaissance phase will include all these\nelements. If intrinsic aspects of the managed phenomena are well understood by attackers, weaponization\nwill eventually laborious, yet feasible due to high capability agents usually involved in such attacks.\nDepending on the initial weakness to be exploited, installation will take place with digital means, mainly\nthrough properly crafted phishing[244]. Once the system is compromised and the malware is successfully\ninstalled, the attackers can proceed to “command and control” the compromised device by establishing a\ncommunication channel. This is the point of differentiation with non-physical attacks: With fully access to\nthe system or device they can monitor or perform actions with direct physical effects (actions on\n_objectives)._\n\n_Specificities/specialisations: The main specific characteristic of this kind attacks is the direct impact on_\nphysical world. Compromising CPS may lead to attacks on critical systems and, when coordinated with\nother attacks, could increase the impact to threaten human life. The characteristics of a CPS attack will\ndepend of the targeted industry, system, environment and connectivity of the attacked system. Attacks on\nCPS sometimes involves skillsets that go beyond hacking. Specific knowledge about the targeted system or\narchitecture is sometimes needed for develop especially crafted software (or malware) as well. An attacker\nwould need to have some knowledge of the control systems running, especially in highly specific systems\n(i.e. SCADA). However, due to the relatively long supply chains involved in such industrial systems,\nknowledge/intelligence about the managed phenomena and involved components might be easy to\nobtain[244], for example by stealing information or using social engineering techniques.\n\nFinally, another specialization is the occasional use of attacks to supply chain both as knowledge\nacquisition and primary attack method. A manipulation or vulnerability included in a delivered (standard)\nICT component by a supplier can be used as backdoor to numerous prospective (malicious) uses within\nindustrial systems[244].\n\n_Existing representations overviews/resources: On attack vectors of CPS attacks, the following information_\nwas found (indicative):\n\n  - Equation Group Hard drive firmware hacking [270271272273]\n\n269 [http://www.greenbuildermedia.com/internet-of-things/hacking-the-internet-of-things, accessed November 2015.](http://www.greenbuildermedia.com/internet-of-things/hacking-the-internet-of-things)\n270 [http://www.wired.com/2015/02/nsa-firmware-hacking/, accessed November 2015.](http://www.wired.com/2015/02/nsa-firmware-hacking/)\n271 [https://blog.kaspersky.com/equation-hdd-malware/7623/, accessed November 2015.](https://blog.kaspersky.com/equation-hdd-malware/7623/)\n272 [https://securelist.com/files/2015/02/Equation_group_questions_and_answers.pdf, accessed November 2015.](https://securelist.com/files/2015/02/Equation_group_questions_and_answers.pdf)\n273 [https://securelist.com/files/2015/02/Fanny_4.jpg, accessed November 2015.](https://securelist.com/files/2015/02/Fanny_4.jpg)\n\n\n-----\n\n| January 2016\n\n    - Jeep Cherokee: Remote car hacking [274275276277]\n\n    - Hacking IoT: A Case Study on Baby Monitor Exposures and Vulnerabilities[278]\n\n    - Cyber-Physical Attacks Against Vessel Tracking System [279280]\n\n_Involved adversaries: Adversaries involved in CPS attacks are mainly engaged in espionage or sabotage_\nactivities undertaken by nation states or cyberterrorist .In some cases, cyberattacks [281] or coordinated\nactivities has been performed by cybercriminals or hacktivists.\n\n##### Targeted attacks\n\n_Description: Targeted attacks are malicious attacks that are aimed to a specific individual, company, system_\nor software based on some specific knowledge regarding the target[282]. These attacks are not widespread,\nbut rather are designed to actively pursue and compromise a target infrastructure. Based on such\nknowledge, adversaries proceed to craft specific messages or other artefacts to lure the victim. When\narriving at the victim end, due to the familiarity that has been built (i.e. reference to a familiar personal,\norganisational process/matter) the message is not recognized as malicious, increasing the chances for the\nvictim to “bite” the bait and allowing the initial infection.\n\n_Relation to kill-chain: Targeted attacks usually covers all phases of a kill chain. Usually a target attack starts_\nwith reconnaissance: the threat actor identify, collect and gather publicly available information in order to\nbe able to customize their attack in a successful manner. In this initial phase, actors aims to obtain valuable\nand strategic information in many different areas such IT environment, organizational structure or\npersonal information. The information gathered can range from the business applications and software to\nthe roles and relationships that could exists in the organization. Is possible to find the utilization of social\nengineering techniques to obtain information like recent events, work-related issues concerns, and other\nareas of interest for the intended target for the creation of more convincing artefacts to perform the\ninfection (weaponization). The delivery takes place by means of the time point the victim “bites the bait”\nand can be done through different methods depending on the organization, resources and the target.After\nthe malicious artefact is executed, the exploitation takes place: Exploit code executes the payload and\nexploits vulnerability in an application component to execute specific commands in the context of end-user\nsystem. Eventually, if the exploitation is successfully executed, the malicious artefact performs an\ninstallation, usually by downloading a piece of malware on on the end-user system that may establish a\ncommunication channel (command and control) with the adversary in order to perform different actions\non objective (data exfiltration, lateral movement, obtaining company information)[283].\n\n274 [https://blog.kaspersky.com/blackhat-jeep-cherokee-hack-explained/9493/, accessed November 2015.](https://blog.kaspersky.com/blackhat-jeep-cherokee-hack-explained/9493/)\n275 [http://www.wired.com/2015/07/hackers-remotely-kill-jeep-highway/, accessed November 2015.](http://www.wired.com/2015/07/hackers-remotely-kill-jeep-highway/)\n276 [http://www.darkreading.com/jeep-hack-0day-an-exposed-port/d/d-id/1321642?_mc=RSS_DR_EDT, accessed](http://www.darkreading.com/jeep-hack-0day-an-exposed-port/d/d-id/1321642?_mc=RSS_DR_EDT)\n\nNovember 2015.\n277 [http://files.tested.com/photos/2014/05/06/61092-screen-shot-2014-05-06-at-3.png, accessed November 2015.](http://files.tested.com/photos/2014/05/06/61092-screen-shot-2014-05-06-at-3.png)\n[278https://www.rapid7.com/docs/Hacking-IoT-A-Case-Study-on-Baby-Monitor-Exposures-and-Vulnerabilities.pdf,](https://www.rapid7.com/docs/Hacking-IoT-A-Case-Study-on-Baby-Monitor-Exposures-and-Vulnerabilities.pdf)\n\naccessed November 2015.\n279 [https://securityledger.com/2014/12/research-finds-cyber-physical-attacks-against-vessel-tracking-system/,](https://securityledger.com/2014/12/research-finds-cyber-physical-attacks-against-vessel-tracking-system/)\n\naccessed November 2015.\n280 [http://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/a-security-evaluation-of-ais,](http://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/a-security-evaluation-of-ais)\n\naccessed November 2015.\n281 [http://thehackernews.com/2015/07/smart-city-cyber-attack.html, accessed November 2015.](http://thehackernews.com/2015/07/smart-city-cyber-attack.html)\n[282 http://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/definition/targeted-attacks, accessed November 2015.](http://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/definition/targeted-attacks)\n[283 http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/feature/Targeted-Cyber-Attacks, accessed November 2015.](http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/feature/Targeted-Cyber-Attacks)\n\n\n-----\n\n| January 2016\n\n_Specificities/specialisations: Threat actors may use varied methods to infiltrate a target’s infrastructure._\nCommon methods include customized spear phishing email, zero-day or software exploits, and watering\nhole techniques. Attackers also utilize instant-messaging, social engineering components and social\nnetworking platforms to entice targets to click a link or download malware[284].These attackers have a\ncertain level of expertise and have sufficient resources to conduct their schemes over a long-term period.\nThey can adapt, adjust, or improve their attacks to counter their victim’s defences. Several of these attacks\nmay be crafted to fit a particular sector[285,286,287,288]and may be based on hypes from breaking news, political\nevents, crises, conflicts, etc.[289,290].\n\n_Existing representations overviews/resources: On attack vectors of targeted attacks, the following_\ninformation was found:\n\n  - Targeted attack generic[291,292].\n\n  - Pawn Storm: an example Spear Phishing targeted attack[293].\n\n  - Targeted attack through SMS[294].\n\n  - Carnabank: Target attack to bank institutions with spear phishing and dropper[295,296].\n\n_Involved adversaries: All kinds of adversaries can be involved in targeted attacks: cyber-criminals, online_\nsocial hackers, hacktivists, nation states, corporations, employees, cyber fighters, cyber terrorists, script\nkiddies\n\n##### Advanced Persistent Threats (APT)\n\n_Description: Advanced Persistent Threats refer to a diverse set of stealthy processes targeting a specific_\nentity and performed by threat agents with high capacities. They are usually encompassed in specific\ncampaigns against particular organizations or sectors.

In\nfact, the degree of capabilities and resources demonstrated within such attacks can mainly be attributed to\nteams with large resources and budget, not usually concerned with costs or direct economic revenue, as\nyou can find in other cybercriminal groups. It is assumed that only state sponsored espionage can explain\nthe provision of such an amount of resources.\n\n_Relation to kill-chain: By design, an advanced persistent threat (APT) uses multiple phases to break into a_\nnetwork, avoid detection, and harvest valuable information over the long term mission[299]. It is correct to\nsay that an APT is operating in the full spectrum of computer intrusion and covering, therefore, all the\nphases of kill-chain[300] (reconnaissance, weaponisation, delivery, exploitation, installation, command and\ncontrol, action on objectives)[301].\n\nAs a targeted attack, the threat agent performs different actions in order to obtain knowledge about the\ninternal composition of the target organization: Personnel, organizational information, possible\nweaknesses, etc. to prepare an attack in a successful manner. Recognized attack vectors include infected\nmedia[302], supply chain compromise, and social engineering including combination of different attacks[303].\nThe purpose of these attacks is to place custom malicious code on one or multiple computers for specific\ntasks and to remain undetected for the longest possible period[304]. For this purpose, different approaches\nhas been found depending on the target's posture: From APT’s using publicly available exploit against a\nwell-known vulnerability to APT’s which researches new vulnerabilities and develop custom exploits[305].\nOnce established a communication inside the network the attacker will usually proceed map the\norganization’s defences and will deploy multiple kill-chains to ensure the persistence and will obtain the\nfinal actions on objectives[306].\n\n_Specificities/specialisations: APTs are also targeted attacks that are initiated by threat agents with high_\ncapabilities. They are not opportunistic or casual intruders, the adversary is formally tasked to accomplish\na mission and it is organized, well-funded and motivated. Main specificity of APT is the long duration of the\nattack.\n\nAnother important characteristic is the differentiation between campaigns and objectives: depending of\nthe target organization an APT attack will vary, modifying different aspects such attack vector or malware\n\n298 [http://www.zdnet.com/article/black-vine-anthem-hackers-share-zero-days-with-rival-cyberattackers/, accessed](http://www.zdnet.com/article/black-vine-anthem-hackers-share-zero-days-with-rival-cyberattackers/)\n\nNovember 2015.\n299 [http://www.symantec.com/theme.jsp?themeid=apt-infographic-1, accessed November 2015.](http://www.symantec.com/theme.jsp?themeid=apt-infographic-1)\n300 [https://blogs.mcafee.com/mcafee-labs/intel-security-protecting-customers-takes-precedence-seeking-headlines/,](https://blogs.mcafee.com/mcafee-labs/intel-security-protecting-customers-takes-precedence-seeking-headlines/)\n\naccessed November 2015.\n[301https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat#mediaviewer/File:Advanced_persistent_threat_lifecycl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat#mediaviewer/File:Advanced_persistent_threat_lifecycle.jpg)\n\ne.jpg, accessed November 2015.\n302 [https://www2.fireeye.com/rs/fireye/images/rpt-apt30.pdf, accessed November 2015.](https://www2.fireeye.com/rs/fireye/images/rpt-apt30.pdf)\n303 [http://i1-news.softpedia-static.com/images/news2/HeartBeat-Advanced-Persistent-Threat-Aimed-at-South-](http://i1-news.softpedia-static.com/images/news2/HeartBeat-Advanced-Persistent-Threat-Aimed-at-South-Korean-Government-2.jpg)\n\n[Korean-Government-2.jpg, accessed November 2015.](http://i1-news.softpedia-static.com/images/news2/HeartBeat-Advanced-Persistent-Threat-Aimed-at-South-Korean-Government-2.jpg)\n304 [http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/2403740/chinese-hacker-group-has-been-spying-on-governments-for-](http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/2403740/chinese-hacker-group-has-been-spying-on-governments-for-a-decade-says-fireeye)\n\n[a-decade-says-fireeye, accessed November 2015.](http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/2403740/chinese-hacker-group-has-been-spying-on-governments-for-a-decade-says-fireeye)\n305 [http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/analysis-of-cve-2015-2360-duqu-2-0-zero-day-](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/analysis-of-cve-2015-2360-duqu-2-0-zero-day-vulnerability/)\n\n[vulnerability/, accessed November 2015.](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/analysis-of-cve-2015-2360-duqu-2-0-zero-day-vulnerability/)\n306 [http://apac.trendmicro.com/cloud-content/us/images/icons/icon_atp-diagram-lifecycle.png, accessed November](http://apac.trendmicro.com/cloud-content/us/images/icons/icon_atp-diagram-lifecycle.png)\n\n2015.\n\n\n-----\n\n| January 2016\n\nused.

Emerging Threat Landscape\n\nIn this chapter threat trends and security issues related to a number of emerging technology areas are\npresented. This part of the document constitutes the Emerging Threat Landscape. It presents the way\nidentified cyber-threat may affect technology areas that are coming up and make up the state-of-the-art in\nnew technological developments.\n\nFor the various areas discussed, top 10 cyber-threats are enlisted with the intention to demonstrate what\nthe most likely exposures for the coming period will be. These cyber-threats have been assessed by the\ninformation collection effort and are an indication for the threat landscape of a particular technology area.\nObviously, the assessed threat exposure will be related to some weaknesses of these technologies.\nAdversaries will be explore those weaknesses by exposing them to the assessed cyber-threats. Due to the\nemergence nature of these technologies, new exploitations will take place in the future that cannot be\npredicted by now. The presented material is thought of as identifying possible exposure trends.\n\nBesides the identification of the threat exposure of each emerging technology area, a number of security\nissues relate to that area are also identified. These issues concern security issues emerging from various\nproperties but also use-cases of the technology area. These issues regard highlights/conclusions/open\nproblems that have come to our attention during the analysis of material found and/or interactions with\nexperts within and outside ENISA. Although not exhaustive, these issues might constitute focal points for\nfuture ENISA work. For example, related issues in the area of Network Virtualisation and Software Defined\nNetworks mentioned in last year’s report have been addressed by means of a Thematic Landscape that has\nbeen developed in 2015 in that area[320]. Similarly, some of the areas that are covered in this chapter may\nbe the subject of more detailed threat assessments within 2016, depending on feedback from ENISA\nstakeholders.\n\nIn 2015, emerging areas from last ETL reports have been kept. Only one has been abandoned, namely\nTrust Infrastructure. This is due to the fact that this area has received particular attention within ENISA,\nmainly through its engagement in the eIDAS activities[321].\n\nThe emerging technology areas considered in this ETL are:\n\n    - _Cloud Computing: being an important component in modern application architectures, cloud_\ncomputing is being considered within emerging technologies as main target of cyber-threats. This is\nmainly due to the vast number of potentially valuable information stored and/or processed. As such, it\nbothers security experts and users in the future. Development of security controls, innovative cloud\nusage, new attack scenarios are emerging security matters for this technology.\n\n    - _Mobile Computing: Mobile computing is still an area with high innovation potential. Mobile devices_\ncontinue to be platforms for the migration of application logic, covering in particular the user\ninteraction part. Moreover, mobile platforms as such offer a big potential for innovative applications,\nwhile they are acting as a convergence/integration channel for various interconnected gadgets. We are\ngoing to see a lot of mobile-based innovation happening in the areas of smart environments, smart\ntransportation, mobile-health, etc. As already shown by the current threat landscape, such\nenvironments will be favourite targets for cyber-criminals.\n\n320 [https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-thematic-](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-thematic-landscapes/sdn-threat-landscape)\n\n[landscapes/sdn-threat-landscape, accessed January 2016.](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-thematic-landscapes/sdn-threat-landscape)\n321 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and\n[trust/library/presentations/june2015/06%20Gorniak%20TSP-CAB%20ENISA, accessed November 2015.](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-trust/library/presentations/june2015/06%20Gorniak%20TSP-CAB%20ENISA)\n\n\n-----\n\n| January 2016\n\n  - _Cyber Physical Systems (CPS): Cyber-physical systems represent the “melting point” between the_\nphysical and cyber worlds. Every time software is used to manage a physical process or physical\nphenomena are bridged with each other via software, a cyber-physical interface is available. The\nintegration of the physical, engineered systems with software environments enforces users to bridge\nexisting silos, such as security and safety, product quality with performance and availability, efficiency\nwith smart functions. These and other issues pose challenges to cyber-security.\n\n  - _Internet of Things (IoT): Interconnected devices forming ad hoc networks as part of some application_\nare an area of growth and innovation. IoT can be considered as a special case of CPS, when\ninterconnected devices cope with some physical phenomena, i.e. managing home environment, be\npart of assisted living, etc. IoT is an implementation of pervasive/ubiquitous computing, leading to the\nchallenge of blurry/unstable security perimeter. IoT will force the cyber-security community to develop\nnew approaches for securing IoT functions and data.\n\n  - _Big Data: Besides IoT, big data is considered as the next avenue of IT innovation. By collecting data_\nfrom various infrastructures, applications, storage and IT-environments - often as IT side-productsenables data collectors to draw conclusions that are themselves products. In this way, vast\nunstructured and initially unrelated data can be put in context and provide valuable conclusions that\ncan be part of other products/services. As such, big data may be used to synthesize information that is\nsecurity relevant, confidential, personal, etc. As such big data has a great security relevance.\n\n  - _Network Virtualization and Software Defined Networks (SDN / 5G): This technology will impact the area_\nof networks in a similar way cloud computing affected traditional computing. Hardware and software\nnetwork components are integrated into a virtual entity that can be operated and managed\nseamlessly, without paying any attention to physical elements of the network. Major investments are\ncurrently made in this area worldwide. The security challenges for this technology are going to be\nconsiderable and of a new quality.\n\nIt should be noted that, just as cyber-threats, the above areas are not completely independent or overlap\nfree. Mobile computing and cloud computing, for example, are parts of IoT environments. Similarly,\nSDN/5G networks might be composed of ad hoc networks of smart components, or their management\nmight be based on big data. Assessing threat trends according to those areas, however, allows for a better\nestablishment of the context of each threat and helps assessing threat trends and security issues in that\narea. It is worth noticing that some predictions for 2016 that have been developed around the end of the\nreporting period use also these areas as clustering of cyber-security developments and draw similar\nconclusions[338,54,191,90].\n\nIn the following sections a short discussion including highlights in each particular area is given. For each\narea, whenever applicable, the top 10 threats have been assessed. In addition to the emerging threats, for\neach area we provide a number of important issues regarding developments/challenges in cyber-security\nthat are seen as relevant for the particular area. It should be noted that these threat trends are not always\nresult of detailed assessments. This is because of the emerging nature of these areas. Hence, both the\nprioritisation and assessed trends are predictive and as such rather indicative for each particular area.\n\nReferences to resources indicate the sources used for the assessment. With this information, interested\nreaders can have a deeper insight into the relevant matter.\n\n##### Cloud computing\n\nCloud computing is a reality for many businesses. Besides using the cloud for their data and databases, this\nplatform comes increasingly packaged in many end-user applications in all areas, such as web\nconferencing, telephony, office applications, etc. And this tendency will keep up in the future, as cloud is\n\n\n-----\n\n| January 2016\n\ninherent part in mobile environments, smart environments, Internet of Things[338], jut to mention the main\nemerging ones. Many users perceive cloud as secure place, as it provides security controls that seem to\ncover mainstream cyber-threats. It seems that majority of cloud users see security/compliance issues as\nmain criteria for selecting a cloud solution[322].\n\nOn the other hand, many businesses, without performing any risk assessment with regard to the ratio\ndata-value vs. threat exposure, and without checking existing security controls, trust cloud services. This is\na risky situation, typical in outsourcing ventures. This is certainly not a weakness of the cloud technology\nper se, but of the security posture of cloud users. Fact is, that due to the confidential nature of data\nstored/processed in the cloud, they will sooner or later attract the attention of a wide spectrum of threat\nagents with a wide spectrum of capabilities.\n\nDespite ongoing discussion about cloud security, cloud environments have increased security maturity.\nVarious providers and associations are going through a continuous improvement of security practices[323].\nThey offer controls for malware analysis, audit, forensics, identity management, etc. At the same time,\nencountered incidents have been analysed[324] and existing controls are being adapted to accommodate\nchanges of the threat landscape.\n\nTop emerging threats to cloud computing are:\n\n**Emerging Threat** **Threat**\n\n**Trend**\n\n1. **Malicious code** \n\n2. **Web based attacks** \n\n3. **Web application attacks** \n\n4. **Botnets** \n\n5. **Denial of Service** \n\n6. **Insider threat** \n\n7. **Data breaches** \n\n8. **Cyber espionage** \n\n9. **Identity Theft** \n\n10. **Information leakage** \n\nLegend:  Declining,  Stable,  Increasing\n\n**Table 4: Emerging threats and their trends in the area of cloud computing**\n\n322 [https://hbr.org/resources/pdfs/comm/verizon/19319_HBR_Report_Verizon_Cloud_6.pdf, accessed November](https://hbr.org/resources/pdfs/comm/verizon/19319_HBR_Report_Verizon_Cloud_6.pdf)\n\n2015.\n323 [https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/research/, accessed November 2015.](https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/research/)\n324 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_celebrity_photo_hack, accessed November 2015.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_celebrity_photo_hack)\n\n\n-----\n\n| January 2016\n\nBesides the above emerging threat landscape, the following issues have been identified:\n\n  - Attention to risk exposure from cloud usage gained by executives. This is a positive development,\ngiven that the highest remediation rates are achieved if the board is accountable for security[62]. One\nthing that needs the attention of decision makers, however, is the discrepancy between risk\nperception and risk reality. It has been reported that perceived cloud related risks are in most case\nhigher than real ones[325]. This can be costly and misleading.\n\n  - More and more business application come with integrated cloud support. It has been reported that in\nan average company there are few hundreds cloud enabled applications installed[326]. With this huge\nnumber of cloud applications operated, it is essential to check cloud upon enforcement of security\npolicies with regard to storage, communication, authentication, confidentiality, etc. In most of the\ncases, however, it can be assumed that there is no assurance that security policies and controls have\nbeen or can be checked upon enforcement.\n\n  - Just as customers request cloud provider to adapt their security controls to the threat environment,\nusers of cloud should check adoption/balance between own and could offered controls. In areas\nwhere a mismatch exists, customers need to close the gaps by advising the cloud provider. In some\nreports this is expressed by means of a better “enterprise adoption”[325] and should concern both\nparties (i.e. customer and cloud provider). Whatever the degree of adoption is, the emerging threat\nlandscape makes it necessary to assess the use of encryption, key management, mutual transparency\nregarding existing controls and commonly agreed security architecture development paths.\n\n  - One point that should not left out from the emerging landscape of cloud computing is its role in the\ncurrent trend of the consumerization of cyber-crime. In the reporting period we have seen threat\nagents using advantages of cloud computing, for example to set up botnets[71]. By taking as given that\nthe trend of cyber-crime-as-a-service will continue, the cyber-security and cloud community should\npay attention on cloud usage for this purpose. One cannot exclude the use of private clouds for this\npurpose that might be already available in the dark net[327].\n\n##### Mobile computing\n\nIn the reporting period mobile computing has started receiving the attention it deserves: departing from\nthe mobile as “hype” and come to mobile as a tool at the hands of end-users. An initial signal in this\ndirection came from Verizon[85], stating that “mobile is not a preferred vector for data breaches”. Similarly,\ninfections with “real” malware shown very low levels (0,03%)[85]. So, what is wrong? Do low number of\nmisuse cases come to contradict predictions? The answer to this question has to do with the comparison\nof reality vs. expectations. Apparently mobile computing is a clear cut case of a vague reality assessment:\nexpectations of security experts about wrong things to happen with mobile could not meet reality. The\nmismatch between reality and expectation is big.\n\nOn the other hand, in the same period other reports speak about high levels of misuse of mobile apps[328]. 8\nand 7% are the rates for malicious apps coming from China and Taiwan, respectively. Malicious apps\nbothered us this year during the incident with Apple Store[46,47]. Such apps are reportedly collecting user\n\n325 [http://enterprise-encryption.vormetric.com/rs/vormetric/images/Cloud-and-BigData-Edition-2015-Vormetric-](http://enterprise-encryption.vormetric.com/rs/vormetric/images/Cloud-and-BigData-Edition-2015-Vormetric-Insider-Threat-Report-Final.pdf)\n\n[Insider-Threat-Report-Final.pdf, accessed November 2015.](http://enterprise-encryption.vormetric.com/rs/vormetric/images/Cloud-and-BigData-Edition-2015-Vormetric-Insider-Threat-Report-Final.pdf)\n326 [https://resources.netskope.com/h/i/66292735-netskope-cloud-report-emea-edition-april-2015-infographic,](https://resources.netskope.com/h/i/66292735-netskope-cloud-report-emea-edition-april-2015-infographic)\n\naccessed November 2015.\n327 [http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240239259/Darknet-technologies-have-legitimate-security-uses-says-](http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240239259/Darknet-technologies-have-legitimate-security-uses-says-researcher)\n\nresearcher, accessed November 2015.\n328 [http://www.marblesecurity.com/enterprise/, accessed November 2015.](http://www.marblesecurity.com/enterprise/)\n\n\n-----\n\n| January 2016\n\ninformation such as private data, contact databases, browser data etc. It seems that one solid misuse case\nfor mobile devices is the collection of personal data.\n\nAnother report in 2015 concludes that the main monetization vector in the area of mobile computing\nseems to be malvertisement[329]. Another realistic misuse case of mobile is given due to its role in expanding\nthe security perimeter: through spyware and traffic monitoring, identities and information can be leaked.\nThat information can be used for data breaches by means of a secondary attack vector.\n\nIt seems that these misuse-scenarios of mobile will be the ones to be more aggressively abused in the\nfuture. To this extend, top emerging threats to mobile computing are:\n\n**Emerging Threat** **Threat**\n\n**Trend**\n\n**1.** **Malware** \n\n**2.** **Physical Theft/Loss/Damage** \n\n**3.** **Web application attacks** \n\n**4.** **Phishing** \n\n**5.** **Web based attacks** \n\n**6.** **Information Leakage** \n\n**7.** **Identity Theft** \n\n**8.** **Data breaches** \n\n**9.** **Ransomware** \n\n**10.** **Botnets** \n\nLegend:  Declining,  Stable,  Increasing\n\n**Table 5: Emerging threats and their trends in the area of Mobile Computing**\n\nBesides the above emerging threat landscape, the following issues have been identified:\n\n- Mobile computing is in most of the cases in co-existence with cloud storage and wireless networking.\nDefinitely vast part of mobile devices use network services to synchronize stored information with\ncloud services or other computers. In many cases wireless networks like WLAN/Bluetooth/GSM are\nused for data transfer. The reason for that may be both lack of physical network ports due to size of\nmobile device and convenience of transferring data wirelessly instead of connecting cables.\nInterception of the air interface is far easier for attacker. These are typical security perimeter issues\nthat will continue bothering us in 2016.\n\n- Despite argumentation about “not being a preferred vector for data breaches”[85], leakage of personal\ndata from mobile phones is a data breach. One should not forget that in the era of big data, collecting\nfew tens of records from tens of millions of devices constitutes a “medium to large” data breach. If this\n\n329 [https://securelist.com/files/2015/10/KLReport-IT-threat-evolution-Q3-2015_EN.pdf, accessed November 2015.](https://securelist.com/files/2015/10/KLReport-IT-threat-evolution-Q3-2015_EN.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\n| January 2016\n\ninformation is collected on a regular basis, the damage is huge. An additional dimension towards\nimpact of such breaches is due to the fact that mobile data can be permanently updated and hence it\ndoes not turn obsolete after some time elapses. Another important issue regarding this leakage is that\nit is almost unavoidable: despite protection measures there will always be a weak point that will allow\nfor information leakage.\n\n  - In their role as a secondary channel to a banking attack, mobiles act as a platform to steal banking\ncredentials. In the reporting period this malicious activity has shown a significant increase and reflects\nanother important misuse area for mobile computing, namely identity theft within two factor\nauthentication processes. Hereto, we see malicious activities regarding spyware, SMS-Trojans and\nbaking Trojans[329] continue bothering security experts.\n\n  - The emerging threat landscape for mobile computing will move towards prevailing usage scenarios of\nmobile devices: they are end-user handhelds and thus good for advertisement; they help in collecting\naccurate data about user habits; they serve as secondary channel for authentication and m-commerce;\nand they communicate a great deal of data to storage systems. Adware will continue growing, yet the\nimpressive growth will probably speed down. Information collection will continue aggressively[191], as\nbig data techniques mature. And attacks to credentials and identity will continue, as far as windows of\nopportunity are available that allow their misuse, especially in baking. Given that mobiles are often\nbacked up, we might not see much of ransomware for mobiles.\n\n##### Cyber physical systems\n\nFor the sake of this chapter, the definition of cyber-physical systems from last year’s ETL will be used:\nCyber physical systems are engineered systems that interact with computing equipment being seamlessly\nintegrated to control, manage and optimize physical processes in a variety of areas from traditional\nengineering science[330]. In essence, a cyber-physical interface exists when a piece of software controls a\nphysical phenomenon, such as temperature, pressure, movements of a robot, industrial processes, etc.\nUsually, such interfaces are implemented through embedded software programmed within a device and is\nbeing used by applications/operating systems via software drivers. To this extend, cyber-physical\ninterfaces do exist in any device: a hard disc drive, for example is a cyber-physical system where the\nphysical device is being controlled by software.\n\nAs already mentioned, in 2015 we have seen an important incident that has abused embedded software to\nload malware[182]. Such attacks are very difficult to detect and recover from. In the particular example, the\nhack survives reinstallation of the operating system and disk formatting. Yet, it is obvious that this\nresistance in defence measures are typical for embedded software, as it is not subject of any available\ninformation security control.\n\nIn the reporting period some important developments have taken place in this area, such as a draft of a\ncyber-physical framework to establish the basis for further discussion in this area[331]. Other reports position\ncyber-physical systems within industrial systems[332]. These is important step as they allow for the\n\n330 [https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-landscape/enisa-threat-landscape-2014/at_download/fullReport)\n\n[landscape/enisa-threat-landscape-2014/at_download/fullReport, accessed November 2015.](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-landscape/enisa-threat-landscape-2014/at_download/fullReport)\n331 [http://www.cpspwg.org/Portals/3/docs/CPS%20PWG%20Draft%20Framework%20for%20Cyber-](http://www.cpspwg.org/Portals/3/docs/CPS%20PWG%20Draft%20Framework%20for%20Cyber-Physical%20Systems%20Release%200.8%20September%202015.pdf)\n\n[Physical%20Systems%20Release%200.8%20September%202015.pdf, accessed November 2015.](http://www.cpspwg.org/Portals/3/docs/CPS%20PWG%20Draft%20Framework%20for%20Cyber-Physical%20Systems%20Release%200.8%20September%202015.pdf)\n332 [https://www.bmwi.de/BMWi/Redaktion/PDF/I/industrie-4-0-und-digitale-](https://www.bmwi.de/BMWi/Redaktion/PDF/I/industrie-4-0-und-digitale-wirtschaft,property=pdf,bereich=bmwi2012,sprache=de,rwb=true.pdf)\n\n[wirtschaft,property=pdf,bereich=bmwi2012,sprache=de,rwb=true.pdf, accessed November 2015.](https://www.bmwi.de/BMWi/Redaktion/PDF/I/industrie-4-0-und-digitale-wirtschaft,property=pdf,bereich=bmwi2012,sprache=de,rwb=true.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\n| January 2016\n\ndevelopment of standard reference architectures, common understanding and a vocabulary for CPS. Also\nthe attention of research and development initiatives are on CPS[333].\n\nAt the level of end consumer, CPS has strong extensions in the areas of smart environments, smart\ntransportation, e-health, but also interconnected devices. From the application point of view, consumer\nrelated applications are summarized by means of the emerging area Internet of Things (see chapter 6.4).\nFrom the physical interface point of view, smart environments are part of the present chapter.\n\nTop emerging threats to cyber physical systems are:\n\n**Emerging Threat** **Threat**\n\n**Trend**\n\n**1.** **Malware** \n\n**2.** **Cyber espionage** \n\n**3.** **Physical damage/theft/loss** \n\n**4.** **Insider threat** \n\n**5.** **Web based attacks** \n\n**6.** **Web application attacks** \n\n**7.** **Phishing (as instrument to infect IT and affect CPS)** \n\n**8.** **Spam (as instrument to infect IT and affect CPS)** \n\n**9.** **Denial of Service** \n\n**10.** **Information leakage** \n\nLegend:  Declining,  Stable,  Increasing\n\n**Table 6: Emerging threats and their trends in the area of cyber physical systems**\n\nBesides the above emerging threat landscape, the following issues have been identified:\n\n- Both US and EU are advancing in CPS during 2015. NIST CPS framework is a positive step towards\nestablishment of standards in this area, including security. In Europe, series of projects have been\ninitiated in the area of embedded systems[334]. Taking into account activities of NIST, one might argue\nthat US are a bit ahead of EU in the settlement of standards, whereas there is a balance in the by\nmeans of research and development activities.\n\n- As regards security issues, a major concern in the area of cyber-physical systems is the alignment of\nsecurity policies between the security and physical worlds. Potential mismatches may lead to critical\nsituations resulting failures of security controls in either environments. For example, blocking a user\naccount after a number of login failures might not be tolerable for the physical environment, if this\n\n333 [https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/cyberphysical-systems-0, accessed November 2015.](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/cyberphysical-systems-0)\n334 [http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/embedded-systems, accessed November 2015.](http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/embedded-systems)\n\n\n-----\n\n| January 2016\n\nuser is engaged in a physical process production process that needs to be managed[335]. Many such\nexamples may be found if the security requirements of the physical system will be compared to the\nones of the IT system.\n\n  - Maintenance of integrity is a fundamental qualitative issue in the interface between the cyber and\nphysical space: none of the intermediate levels should modify values that need to be passed through.\nIrrespectively in which directions, any modification of input/output received from /transmitted to the\nphysical world would mean a hazard for the entire process. Similar manipulations have taken place\nthrough Stuxnet[336].\n\n  - Equally important as integrity will be issues of availability. Both the physical system and the cybercounterpart will need to contain balanced access control mechanisms. Similar balance needs to be\nestablished for issues of confidentiality: functions allowing data discovery in industrial systems should\nbe subject to protective measures that are implemented at the levels of the IT systems in change (e.g.\nnetwork levee, application level). Finally physical characteristics of the controlled components may\nallow to malicious users to damage the equipment[337]. This may turn information about the physical\nprocess implemented subject to confidentiality rules. The interplay of between cyber and physical is\nnot obvious, as there are typical silos that need to be bridged in order to achieve this objective[331 ](e.g.\nsecurity vs. safety, resilience vs. reliability, etc.).\n\n  - Just as it is the case in IoT, in cyber-physical system components are going to join and leave a system\non an ad hoc basis. Given the importance of components in the performance of processes in the\nengineered system in question, trust functions need to be developed for the interacting components.\nDepending on the importance of the process (e.g. gas distribution) and the role of the component (e.g.\npressure meter), it might be necessary to establish a trusted communication. As of today, no\ncomponents exist that support such functions (i.e. in the context of cyber-physical communication)[191].\n\n##### Internet of things (IoT)\n\nAs far as cyber-threats is concerned, Internet of Things was one of the main fields in the 2015’s landscape.\nThis was quite foreseeable already in 2015. And it is foreseeable that this trend is going to continue for\n2016[338,191]. The drivers behind this trend are: i) besides the proliferation of IoT devices in home\nenvironments, one can observe an increased role of wearables in the area of health; ii) the increased use\nof wireless connectivity among devices is of all kinds in various sectors of life is here to stay (i.e. such as\ninterconnected sensors[339], automotive[340341] and smart environments); iii) interaction of all components\nwith mobile and cloud platforms a key of their architecture design.\n\nThe attacks that have taken place in 2015 have abused weaknesses in basic security controls. Malware\nattacks have led to a takeover of routers to form botnets[69,70]. The abused weaknesses are due to missing or\nill-configured security controls and practices. On the other hand, although privacy of IoT was and remain a\n\n335 [http://www.securityweek.com/cyberphysical-security-next-frontier, accessed November 2015.](http://www.securityweek.com/cyberphysical-security-next-frontier)\n336 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet, accessed November 2015.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet)\n337 [http://www.networkworld.com/article/2968432/microsoft-subnet/cyber-physical-attacks-hacking-a-chemical-](http://www.networkworld.com/article/2968432/microsoft-subnet/cyber-physical-attacks-hacking-a-chemical-plant.html)\n\nplant.html, accessed November 2015.\n338 [http://www.mcafee.com/us/resources/reports/rp-threats-predictions-2016.pdf, accessed November 2015.](http://www.mcafee.com/us/resources/reports/rp-threats-predictions-2016.pdf)\n339 [http://www.esp8266.com/, accessed November 2015.](http://www.esp8266.com/)\n340 [http://www.mcafee.com/ca/resources/white-papers/wp-automotive-security.pdf, accessed November 2015.](http://www.mcafee.com/ca/resources/white-papers/wp-automotive-security.pdf)\n341 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicular_ad_hoc_network, accessed November 2015.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicular_ad_hoc_network)\n\n\n-----\n\n| January 2016\n\nconcern[342,343], not much privacy breaches/incident have been assessed in 2015. However, in 2015 identity\ninformation has topped types of breached data. And such data have been breached from mobile devices,\nin particular in the area of health. In addition, with the proliferation of big data techniques, information\n“crumbs” found in ad hoc wireless networks will be valuable input in profile building.\n\nAn additional dimension related to IoT are cyber-physical security issues addressed within this report (see\nchapters 3.16 and 6.3). When exploring cyber-physical systems of a smart home environment, for example,\none might be in the position to create the perfect ransomware[344]; or be in the position to generate severe\nimpact to the house lord by impacting vital functions of the building (i.e. electricity, heat, etc.).\n\nIoT security issues definitely relate with the complexity resulting the convergence of multiple platforms\nand applications into a system-of-systems. Sensors are wirelessly interconnected with mobile gadgets,\nthese gadgets communicate with storage and applications hosted in the cloud; these systems may be\nmanaged by users over mobile devices. In these cyclic dependencies among components, exploits may\nhave amplification effect on impacts throughout the entire chain of interrelated components. These and\nsimilar security issues are subject of ENISA work to be released in 2016 in the area of Smart Cities[345] and\nTransportation[345]. This work is based on a threat assessment based on the present threat landscape.\n\nTop emerging threats to internet of things/interconnected devices/smart environments are:\n\n**Emerging Threat** **Threat**\n\n**Trend**\n\n**1.** **Malware** \n\n**2.** **Botnets (abusing IoT components as botnet nodes and/or C2 servers)** \n\n**3.** **Identity theft** \n\n**4.** **Web based attacks** \n\n**5.** **Physical theft/damage/loss** \n\n**6.** **Phishing** \n\n**7.** **Insider threat** \n\n**8.** **Information leakage** \n\n**9.** **Web application attacks** \n\n342 [http://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/EY-cybersecurity-and-the-internet-of-things/$FILE/EY-cybersecurity-](http://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/EY-cybersecurity-and-the-internet-of-things/$FILE/EY-cybersecurity-and-the-internet-of-things.pdf)\n\n[and-the-internet-of-things.pdf, accessed November 2015.](http://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/EY-cybersecurity-and-the-internet-of-things/$FILE/EY-cybersecurity-and-the-internet-of-things.pdf)\n343 [https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/federal-trade-commission-staff-report-november-2013-](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/federal-trade-commission-staff-report-november-2013-workshop-entitled-internet-things-privacy/150127iotrpt.pdf)\n\n[workshop-entitled-internet-things-privacy/150127iotrpt.pdf, accessed November 2015.](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/federal-trade-commission-staff-report-november-2013-workshop-entitled-internet-things-privacy/150127iotrpt.pdf)\n344 [http://www.csoonline.com/article/2960787/cyber-attacks-espionage/report-iot-is-the-next-frontier-for-](http://www.csoonline.com/article/2960787/cyber-attacks-espionage/report-iot-is-the-next-frontier-for-ransomware.html)\n\n[ransomware.html, accessed November 2015.](http://www.csoonline.com/article/2960787/cyber-attacks-espionage/report-iot-is-the-next-frontier-for-ransomware.html)\n345 [https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/smart-infrastructures/smart-homes/security-](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/smart-infrastructures/smart-homes/security-resilience-good-practices/at_download/fullReport)\n\n[resilience-good-practices/at_download/fullReport, accessed December 2015.](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/smart-infrastructures/smart-homes/security-resilience-good-practices/at_download/fullReport)\n\n\n-----\n\n| January 2016\n\n**Emerging Threat** **Threat**\n\n**Trend**\n\n**10.** **Denial of Service** \n\nLegend:  Declining,  Stable,  Increasing\n\n**Table 7: Emerging threats and their trends in the area of Internet of things, interconnected devices and smart environments**\n\nBesides the above emerging threat landscape, the following issues have been identified:\n\n- Though the exploitations we have seen till now are just of reduced scope and impact, it is a matter of\ntime to see attacks affecting more than one levels/components of an IoT scenario. Particular impact\nmay be created to denial of service attacks to devices that are critical for human health, i.e. in assisted\nliving systems[346]. It is worth mentioning that due to the long chain of dependencies between\ninvolved/interconnected components, single points of failure and weakest link exploitation of IoT\ncomponents are to be taken care of[347].\n\n- Just as it is the case in the web, where commercial players are gathering information about user\nbehaviour, IoT will be a premium place to collect consumer data about intimate, highly marketable\ninformation on habits of individuals. This information will be equally interesting for malicious agents\naiming at understanding the habits of the victims, including the ones interested in physical assets (i.e. e\nburglars).\n\n- Security and privacy considerations of entire IoT systems may arise sometime after their\nimplementation, when the interplay of components has been set within a certain application scenario.\nWilling to fulfil such requirements ex-post, might be very costly, especially when individual\ncomponents involved do not support functions to implement those requirements[348]. In monolithic\nlegacy applications, though difficult, adding additional security controls was more feasible, even by\nadding them as external to the application at stake. This will not be so easy with interconnected\ncomponents, mainly due to the ever changing perimeter.\n\n- From incident statistics becomes evident that human error and insider threats, if taken together, are\nsufficient to top the list of cyber-threats. Given the fact that IoT will be used mainly by cyber-novices\nand, given the relatively large number of “insiders” within a smart environment (i.e. smart home), it\nneeds not much prediction skills to find the prime source of IoT abuse. These are going to be users and\nall insiders surrounding them.\n\n- Gradual proliferation of IoT applications will pose additional requirements to the internet\ninfrastructure. Surveys refer to bandwidth issues for various families of components, starting from\nWiFi frequencies to network traffic, server and application processing capabilities[342]. This will be the\ncase for cloud environments that will be main information storage components.\n\n- When various sensors and components join or leave an ad hoc (wireless) network, it is necessary to\ncheck level of trust. According to that level, they might be allowed (or not) to access parts of the\navailable services and data. Though some infrastructures support security functions and establish trust\n\n346 [http://www.demorgen.be/technologie/anonymous-probeert-ehealth-te-hacken-b8614dbe/, accessed November](http://www.demorgen.be/technologie/anonymous-probeert-ehealth-te-hacken-b8614dbe/)\n\n2015.\n347 [https://securelist.com/analysis/publications/72595/surviving-in-an-iot-enabled-world/, accessed November 2015.](https://securelist.com/analysis/publications/72595/surviving-in-an-iot-enabled-world/)\n348 [https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2015/04/retail-tracking-firm-settles-ftc-charges-it-misled-](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2015/04/retail-tracking-firm-settles-ftc-charges-it-misled-consumers)\n\nconsumers, accessed November 2015.\n\n\n-----\n\n| January 2016\n\nlevels[349], trust functions are not based on device properties but rather on functions of the\ninfrastructure. Although it is a remarkable offering, infrastructure-based security measures might\nsignificantly increase operation costs of IoT applications.\n\n  - But there are also positive developments in this area. It is remarkable that IoT security offerings are\nappearing in the market[349]. Moreover, numerous research and development programmes have been\nkicked off, taking care of security in IoT[350]. Security vendors provide information related to IoT\nvulnerabilities and attack methods[347] to create awareness among users.\n\n##### Big data\n\nThis is the third consecutive year big data appear in ETL’s emerging technologies. In past reports[224] the\nbusiness side and threat intelligence point of view have been discussed; both areas continue to be heavily\ndeveloped. According to estimates, it is believed that “the value of European citizens’ personal data has the\n_potential to grow to nearly €1 trillion annually by 2020”[351], becoming a significant economic drive. Scientific_\nbig data continue to proliferate and many agencies and institutions in Europe and worldwide have or will\nlaunch big data projects to facilitate scientific data analysis and exploitation[352] (e.g. the European Centre for\nNuclear Research (CERN) – Worldwide LHC Computing Grid[353], the European Space Agency big data\nInitiative[354] [355], the UK Data Service[356] etc.).\n\nBig data technologies have already been deployed within national security applications, an important force\nbehind current and future big data research and development[357]. Operations such as fighting terrorism;\nassisting in combat; gathering and analysing intelligence from heterogeneous sources, including battlefield\ndata and open sources; casual model predictions; or even preventing army suicides[358] are expected to\nsignificantly benefit from big data analytics. Big data seems to be the solution as data has exceeded the\ncapability of unassisted human analysts to understand, analyse and make predictions.\n\nAs predicted in last year’s ETL the abundance of big data usage is not without concerns. Attacks are showing\nan increase trend in both number, sophistication and impact, but given the loose definition of the term and\nthe unwillingness of affected organizations to disclose attack data, accurate estimates are not easy to come\nup with[359] [360]. The European Commission Business Innovation Observatory’s reports[361] notes that “nearly all\n_large organisations experience security breaches or data leaks, sometimes with disastrous consequences._\n_Information from the UK Information Commissioner’s Office shows that local government data leaks_\n\n349 [http://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/products/collateral/se/internet-of-things/iot-system-security-wp.pdf,](http://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/products/collateral/se/internet-of-things/iot-system-security-wp.pdf)\n\naccessed November 2015.\n350 [https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/opportunities/h2020/calls/h2020-iot-2016-](https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/opportunities/h2020/calls/h2020-iot-2016-2017.html#c,topics=callIdentifier/t/H2020-IOT-2016-2017/1/1/1&callStatus/t/Forthcoming/1/1/0&callStatus/t/Open/1/1/0&callStatus/t/Closed/1/1/0&+identifier/desc)\n\n[2017.html#c,topics=callIdentifier/t/H2020-IOT-2016-](https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/opportunities/h2020/calls/h2020-iot-2016-2017.html#c,topics=callIdentifier/t/H2020-IOT-2016-2017/1/1/1&callStatus/t/Forthcoming/1/1/0&callStatus/t/Open/1/1/0&callStatus/t/Closed/1/1/0&+identifier/desc)\n[2017/1/1/1&callStatus/t/Forthcoming/1/1/0&callStatus/t/Open/1/1/0&callStatus/t/Closed/1/1/0&+identifier/de](https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/opportunities/h2020/calls/h2020-iot-2016-2017.html#c,topics=callIdentifier/t/H2020-IOT-2016-2017/1/1/1&callStatus/t/Forthcoming/1/1/0&callStatus/t/Open/1/1/0&callStatus/t/Closed/1/1/0&+identifier/desc)\nsc, accessed November 2015.\n351 [http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-14-186_en.htm, accessed Nov 2015.](http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-14-186_en.htm)\n352 [http://byte-project.eu/10-big-data-initiatives-an-insight-into-the-big-data-landscape/ accessed Nov 2015.](http://byte-project.eu/10-big-data-initiatives-an-insight-into-the-big-data-landscape/)\n353 [http://home.cern/scientists/updates/2015/09/big-data-takes-root accessed Nov 2015.](http://home.cern/scientists/updates/2015/09/big-data-takes-root)\n354 [https://earth.esa.int/web/guest/content/-/article/big-data-from-space-news accessed Nov 2015.](https://earth.esa.int/web/guest/content/-/article/big-data-from-space-news)\n355 [http://www.copernicus-masters.com/index.php?anzeige=press-2015-01.html accessed Nov 2015.](http://www.copernicus-masters.com/index.php?anzeige=press-2015-01.html)\n356 [https://www.ukdataservice.ac.uk/about-us/our-rd/big-data-network-support accessed Nov 2015.](https://www.ukdataservice.ac.uk/about-us/our-rd/big-data-network-support)\n357 [http://www.defenseone.com/reports/harnessing-big-data/122177/ accessed Nov 2015.](http://www.defenseone.com/reports/harnessing-big-data/122177/)\n358 [http://www.apa.org/monitor/2015/04/army-suicide.aspx accessed Nov 2015.](http://www.apa.org/monitor/2015/04/army-suicide.aspx)\n359 [http://www.forbes.com/sites/moneybuilder/2015/01/13/the-big-data-breaches-of-2014/, accessed Nov 2015.](http://www.forbes.com/sites/moneybuilder/2015/01/13/the-big-data-breaches-of-2014/)\n360 [http://www.zdnet.com/article/big-hacks-big-data-add-up-to-blackmailers-dream/, accessed Nov 2015.](http://www.zdnet.com/article/big-hacks-big-data-add-up-to-blackmailers-dream/)\n[361 http://ec.europa.eu/growth/industry/innovation/business-innovation-observatory/case-studies/index_en.htm,](http://ec.europa.eu/growth/industry/innovation/business-innovation-observatory/case-studies/index_en.htm)\n\naccessed Nov 2015.\n\n\n-----\n\n| January 2016\n\n_increased by 1609% over the last five years, while other public organisations showed a 1380% rise. In_\n_addition, private organisations recorded a 1159% surge in data leaks”._\n\nGiven that big data are extremely novel and high tech ICT systems, with little time to mature against cyberattacks, these numbers are directly relevant and indicative of the future. Additionally, as more and more\nbusinesses and organizations venture into the big data field, attackers will have more incentives to develop\nspecialized attacks against big data technologies; e.g. web application attacks exploiting injection to NoSQL\ndatabases and Semantic Web tools, to further equip their tactics. Given the importance of big data, in the\nreporting period ENISA has developed a threat assessment for big data by means of a big data thematic\nlandscape[362].\n\nOne further point for consideration is the interrelation between big data and other technologies; such as\ncloud computing and IoT. More and more it becomes the norm to build big data on top of cloud\ninfrastructure to “to meet certain infrastructure requirements, such as cost-effectiveness, elasticity, and the\n_ability to scale up or down”[363], whereas IoT is considered a ‘big’ producer/provider of raw big data that are_\ngenerated at exceedingly higher speeds and bigger volumes. It is obvious that lack of security in supporting\nor providing technologies and systems has the potential of adversely affecting big data systems.\n\nFinally, one should note that privacy remains a thorny issue in the area of big data: the LIBE Committee\nstates that there is an “increased collection and processing of personal data for various - and often\n_unaccountable - purposes”[364]. ENISA has invested some work in the area of privacy and big data by means_\nof a report overview on privacy enhancing technologies and tools for big data analytics[365].\n\nTop emerging threats to big data are:\n\n**Emerging Threat** **Threat**\n\n**Trend**\n\n**1.** **Web application attacks (to big data systems)** \n\n**2.** **Identity theft** \n\n**3.** **Malware (to affect big data systems)** \n\n**4.** **Insider threat** \n\n**5.** **Phishing** \n\n**6.** **Information leakage (of information stored as big data)** \n\n**7.** **Cyber espionage** \n\n**8.** **Data breaches** \n\n362 [https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-thematic-](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-thematic-landscapes/bigdata-threat-landscape)\n\n[landscapes/bigdata-threat-landscape, accessed January 2015.](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-thematic-landscapes/bigdata-threat-landscape)\n363 [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=6842585, accessed Nov 2015.](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=6842585)\n364 [http://www.europarl.europa.eu/thinktank/en/document.html?reference=IPOL_STU%282015%29536455,](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/thinktank/en/document.html?reference=IPOL_STU%282015%29536455)\n\naccessed Nov 2015.\n365 [https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-trust/library/deliverables/big-data-](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-trust/library/deliverables/big-data-protection/at_download/fullReport)\n\n[protection/at_download/fullReport, accessed December 2015.](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-trust/library/deliverables/big-data-protection/at_download/fullReport)\n\n\n-----\n\n| January 2016\n\n**Emerging Threat** **Threat**\n\n**Trend**\n\n**9.** **Denial of service (to components of big data system)** \n\n**10.** **Legal threats[366] (due to non-conformance with privacy laws)** \n\nLegend:  Declining,  Stable,  Increasing\n\n**Table 8: Emerging threats and their trends in the area of big data**\n\nBesides the above emerging threat landscape, the following issues have been identified:\n\n- Big data and development of Security Incident and Event Management (SIEM) was hailed in previous ETL\nreport for new acquisitions in the area of cyber security. Recently though critical voices have raised\nconcerns on the effectiveness of more data, esp. given the fact that many attacks exploit well known\nvulnerabilities[367,368]. A good balance between exploring new technologies for threat intelligence, cost\nand actually making good use of the generated knowledge is essential.\n\n- Mobile phones with their apps and sensors are a major contributor to the generation of big data but\nissues arise when this collection does not result from informed consent. Apps in mobile phones have\nbeen criticised for covert data collection. A recent research funded by DARPA shows that “63% of the\n_external communication made by top-popular free Android applications from Google Play has no effect_\n_on the user-observable application functionality”[369]. Moreover, more than half of the calls could not be_\nattributed to analytics.\n\n- According to the director of NSA, the Office of Personnel Management data breach that resulted in 21.5\nmillions of stolen records of federal workers, including 5.6 million people's fingerprints[ 370], shows a new\ntrend toward using big data analytics. Breached data can be used within big data to collect information\nabout the individuals behind biometrical data. It has become clear that “increasingly data has a value all\n_its own and that there are people actively out there interested in acquiring data in volumes and numbers_\n_that we didn’t see before”[371]. Such data breaches, which affected 7% of the USA population, can give an_\nedge to adversaries to correlate with other data. With the results they will be in the position to launch\npersonalized and highly efficient phishing attacks, especially if combined with personal information and\nbiometrics[372].\n\n- One remarkable element of the big data state-of-play is the issue of perception: when is data big\nenough to be big data? Besides debates on this topic, it important to understand the “threshold” of\nscale to change the context from data to big data. In many reports, for example, threats related to data\nare referred within big data context. In the ENISA threat assessment in the area of big data[365], we\nfound ourselves debating about what threat exposure is inherent to big data and how this is\n\n366 Although this threat is not a cyber-threat per se and is not addressed in this report, it is a direct consequence of\n\nmisuse resulting correlation of information, often performed within processing of big data.\n367 [http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/11/16/security_black_hat_europe_keynote/, accessed Nov 2015.](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/11/16/security_black_hat_europe_keynote/)\n368 [https://www.blackhat.com/eu-15/briefings.html#what-got-us-here-wont-get-us-there, accessed Nov 2015.](https://www.blackhat.com/eu-15/briefings.html#what-got-us-here-wont-get-us-there)\n369 [https://people.csail.mit.edu/mjulia/publications/Covert_Communication_in_Mobile_Applications_2015.pdf,](https://people.csail.mit.edu/mjulia/publications/Covert_Communication_in_Mobile_Applications_2015.pdf)\n\naccessed Nov 2015.\n370 [http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/07/09/us-cybersecurity-usa-idUSKCN0PJ2M420150709, accessed Nov 2015.](http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/07/09/us-cybersecurity-usa-idUSKCN0PJ2M420150709)\n371 [http://freebeacon.com/national-security/cybercom-big-data-theft-at-opm-private-networks-is-new-trend-in-](http://freebeacon.com/national-security/cybercom-big-data-theft-at-opm-private-networks-is-new-trend-in-cyber-attacks/)\n\n[cyber-attacks/, accessed Nov 2015.](http://freebeacon.com/national-security/cybercom-big-data-theft-at-opm-private-networks-is-new-trend-in-cyber-attacks/)\n372 [http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/us-big-data-breaches-offer-treasure-trove-for-](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/us-big-data-breaches-offer-treasure-trove-for-hackers/articleshow/47567896.cms)\n\n[hackers/articleshow/47567896.cms, accessed Nov 2015.](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/us-big-data-breaches-offer-treasure-trove-for-hackers/articleshow/47567896.cms)\n\n\n-----\n\n| January 2016\n\ndifferentiated in the case of “non-big” data. While this can be easily differentiated when speaking\nabout big data systems, it is fairly difficult if data are in flow or in a temporary storage.\n\n##### Network Function Virtualization, Software Defined Networks and 5G\n\n5G[373] represents the next major phase of mobile telecommunication systems and network architectures\nbeyond the current 4G standards. It aims at extreme broadband and ultra-robust, low latency connectivity,\nto enable the programmable connectivity for the Internet of Things[374]. Despite the significant debate on\nthe technical specifications and the technological maturity of 5G, which are under discussion in various\nfora[375], 5G is expected to affect positively and significantly several industry sectors ranging from ICT to\nindustry sectors such as car and other manufacturing, health and agriculture in the period up to and\nbeyond 2020.\n\n5G will be driven by softwarization of network functions, known as Software Defined Networking (SDN)\nand Network Function Virtualization (NFV). The key concept that underpins SDN is the logical centralization\nof network control functions by decoupling the control and packet forwarding functionality of the network.\nNFV complements this vision through the virtualization of these functionalities based on recent advances\nin general server and enterprise IT virtualization.\n\nConsidering the technological maturity of the technologies that 5G can leverage on, SDN is the one that is\nmoving faster from development to production. For this reason, in the reporting period ENISA has\ndeveloped a specific threat assessment in this area[320].\n\nThough not yet met in the wild, incidents related to SDN, NFV and 5G will orient themselves towards lower\nlevel threats and weaknesses (i.e. concerning low technological network layers) that will then affect higher\nlevel of components and functions. Concrete impacts on these components are difficult to assess at the\ntime being. To this extend, we follow a “bottom-up” approach by estimating threats that exploit more\n“traditional” network components that will be extrapolated to assumed SDN/NFV levels. A more detailed\nview on these threats and their mitigation can be found in 320.\n\nTop emerging threats to NFV, SDN and 5G are:\n\n**Emerging Threat** **Threat**\n\n**Trend**\n\n**1.** **Insider threat** \n\n**2.** **Malware** \n\n**3.** **Physical damage/theft/loss** \n\n**4.** **Web application attacks** \n\n**5.** **Denial of service** \n\n**6.** **Phishing** \n\n**7.** **Identity theft** \n\n373 [www.5g-ppp.eu/roadmaps, accessed November 2015.](http://www.5g-ppp.eu/roadmaps)\n374 [http://ioeassessment.cisco.com/, accessed November 2015.](http://ioeassessment.cisco.com/)\n375 [http://www.3gpp.org/news-events/3gpp-news/1734-ran_5g, accessed November 2015.](http://www.3gpp.org/news-events/3gpp-news/1734-ran_5g)\n\n\n-----\n\n| January 2016\n\n**Emerging Threat** **Threat**\n\n**Trend**\n\n**8.** **Information leakage** \n\n**9.** **Cyber espionage** \n\n**10.** **Data breaches** \n\nLegend:  Declining,  Stable,  Increasing\n\n**Table 9: Emerging threats and their trends in the area of network functions virtualisation, SDN and 5G**\n\nBesides the above emerging threat landscape, the following issues have been identified:\n\n- Despite allowing better performance and monitoring, centralisation of control or logically centralised\ncontrol it is a big concern in SDN security. By having the entire network intelligence concentrated in\none single point, it is single point of failure. At the same time it has multiple threat exposures and\nrepresents a high-value asset to attackers[376]. Compromising this point means, effectively, compromise\nthe whole network by facilitating the launch of further attacks, exploitations or even reprogramming\nthe entire network. The effects of having SDN as a potential target are more devastating that using\ntraditional networks. The threat landscape is continuously evolving and the deployment of\narchitectural components of SDN can lead to new security threats and vulnerabilities.\n\n- Likewise, the programmability aspect of SDNs includes new features that do not exists in the previous\nconception of traditional-closed administrative domains. Such functions, however, may introduce in\naddition to the traditional attack vectors[377], vulnerabilities and risks that did not previously exists. A\ncommon management and network policy enforcement layer multiplies the impact of such\nvulnerabilities to big number of components, increasing dangerously the attack and threat surface.\n\n- Security within the SDN paradigm is a challenge, as all layers, sub-layers and components need to\ncommunicate according to strict security policies. Some of the new challenges on protecting SDN relies\non the main features of this paradigm: centralization, abstraction and programmability. Efforts and\nadvances are being done in order to improve the trust between third party applications and the\ncontroller, a better cross domain connection, implementing correct isolation of traffic and resources\nand integrating and improving the compatibility of legacy protocols[378].\n\n- Security and dependability are becoming the top priorities for SDN[379]. Flexibility provided by SDN can\nenhance the security by facilitating the implementation of a number of security controls for the entire\nmanaged network. For example, centralization as a single point of control and monitoring, enables\nmore consistent enforcement and control of security policies through fewer and uniformly accessible\ncontrollers. In the same manner the deployment of different virtual devices (firewalling, packet\nfiltering, IDS, IPS, load balancing, etc.) can provide a better Quality of Service (QoS), resilience and\nprotection. Finally, automation will allow to facilitate quicker response to malware or DDoS attacks by\nisolation or reaction to changes of the network state, while maintaining the high-level policies in place.\n\n376 [http://umexpert.um.edu.my/file/publication/00001293_118473.pdf, accessed November 2015.](http://umexpert.um.edu.my/file/publication/00001293_118473.pdf)\n377 [http://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.0440.pdf, accessed November 2015.](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.0440.pdf)\n378 [https://www.opennetworking.org/images/stories/downloads/sdn-resources/technical-](https://www.opennetworking.org/images/stories/downloads/sdn-resources/technical-reports/Principles_and_Practices_for_Securing_Software-Defined_Networks_applied_to_OFv1.3.4_V1.0.pdf)\n\n[reports/Principles_and_Practices_for_Securing_Software-Defined_Networks_applied_to_OFv1.3.4_V1.0.pdf,](https://www.opennetworking.org/images/stories/downloads/sdn-resources/technical-reports/Principles_and_Practices_for_Securing_Software-Defined_Networks_applied_to_OFv1.3.4_V1.0.pdf)\naccessed November 2015.\n379 [https://www.ietf.org/proceedings/87/slides/slides-87-sdnrg-2.pdf, accessed November 2015.](https://www.ietf.org/proceedings/87/slides/slides-87-sdnrg-2.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\n| January 2016\n\n### 7. Food for thought: Lessons Learned and Conclusions\n\n##### Lessons learned\n\nETL work conducted in 2015 has allowed us to further deepen our knowledge in threat collection and\nthreat analysis. The experience gained is at the level of the process and of the content, both important\ncomponents of the development of the threat landscape. Regarding the use of our tools to perform the\ntask of threat analysis, we come to a number of points that are summarised below as Lessons from the ETL\n_process. Lessons learned from the developments in the threat landscape are summarized by means of the_\nsection Lessons from the analysed content.\n\n_Lessons from the ETL process:_\n\nThe collection of points below stem from own experience gained during the information collection and\nanalysis activities at ENISA. Moreover, issues identified during the year in the ETL workshop[4], but also\ndiscussions with experts within various ENISA dissemination activities flow in these points. In particular:\n\n    - Less information exchange is needed, not more. But the right information needs to be found. It must\nbe at the right quality, level and context. The existence of large amount of information alone is not\nbeneficial, if the interrelations and proper presentation of correlated information cannot be captured.\n\n    - Threat analysis has commonalities with big data: the discovery of context out of massive data is\ndecisive. Context makes threat information meaningful, useful and durable for some period of time. To\nthis extend, threat information quality is more important than quantity.\n\n    - Development of threat intelligence is a laborious task. Using sharing platforms like MISP[1] makes clear\nhow much effort is required to consolidate large amount of information into a usable entity that\nbalances degree of technical detail, with degree of abstraction and usable information content.\n\n    - Due to diversification in available tools and procedures, it seems that the life-cycles for the creation of\noperational, tactical and strategic intelligence diverge. This affects the quality of produced information\nand poses additional challenges in creating single context throughout all three levels of intelligence.\n\n    - At the time being, creation of strategic and tactical threat intelligence seems to be possible only\nmanually. Automation of this task seems viable only for information persistence of identified\ninformation and interconnections. The creation of context needs a great deal of human intervention.\n\n    - A standardized way for referring to threats, threat categories and threat terminology is necessary.\n\n    - The speed of reaction to cyber threats is an issue that deserves further consideration. However, given\nthe remediation speed of vulnerabilities being one to two years, the life span of strategic and tactical\nintelligence with less than 12 months seems to be sufficient. This means that dissemination work is\ncritical.\n\n    - The right presentation of threat information will be critical for the dissemination across the relevant\nstakeholders. New interactive presentation approaches will need to emerge.\n\n    - Often, threat statistics within various reports are selected ad hoc and difficult to compare. This\ndisallows the consolidation of findings under a common qualitative and quantitative denominator.\n\n_Lessons from the analysed content:_\n\n    - It seems that threat intelligence and threat information is a good instrument for segmentation of\nfeatures of security products. When expressing available product capabilities with regard to mitigation\nof threats, it will help users understanding the nature of provided protection and the necessity of a\n\n\n-----\n\n| January 2016\n\nproduct. To this extend, threat information may be used as an additional instrument toward a userdriven security market.\n\n  - Analysis of incidents makes clear that in most of the cases even basic security controls are not in place\nor fail to provide assumed protection. It is important to develop/propose baseline security controls for\nvarious areas/sectors/scenarios and support small-medium organisations in operating them.\n\n  - Single user and small-medium organisations are in a vicious cycle: they do not have basic security\nmeasures in place and are not aware of the dynamics of the cyber-threat landscape. The cyber-security\ncommunity will need to make thoughts of how to brake this cycle.\n\n  - Vulnerabilities are getting too old: 80% of the vulnerabilities in the wild are getting 1-2 years old\nbefore they are remediated. With such a life span, attempts to reduce exposure to cyber-threats\nbecomes a pointless effort. Apparently, efforts are necessary to help users understanding the notion of\nvulnerability and how to manage it.\n\n  - Phishing is one of the most common vectors leading to malware installation. And it constantly gains\nmomentum. Phishing mitigation is efficient when humans are aware. Training humans is a cost\neffective method that is worth and should be applied in a much wider manner.\n\n  - It seems that consumerization of cyber-crime (aka cyber-crime-as-a-service) is a model that will\ndevelop further. The cyber-security community will need to elaborate on methods to disable the\ndevelopment of this market.\n\n  - The dark net is a place that is unexploited as to knowledge base with regard to cyber-threats and\nactivity of threat agents. A lot more effort will be necessary in order to better explore dark nets to\nenhance cyber-threat intelligence[380].\n\n  - Penetration of IT technology to the physical systems though Internet of Things and Industry 4.0 creates\nstrong links within sectors with differentiating viewpoints with regard to operation processes, business\ncases, roles, security practices, etc. Now, more than ever is time to identify and break silos, especially\nthe ones related to security.\n\n  - Treat agents is still an area with big potential: while some threat agent modelling means have been\ndeveloped, no threat agent models are widely available. Attribution lags behind and information\nsharing about threat agents is at a very low maturity.\n\n##### Conclusions\n\nThe development of the cyber-threat landscape in 2015 has been impressive in one thing: the smoothness\nof its development without big “hypes” in the media. Cyber-threats have evolved while following two\nextremes. Effective simplicity, achieved with a series of “low-tech” highly efficient infection methods. And\neffective complexity, achieved with next generation malware and attack vectors. Our conclusions in 2015\nhave been divided into three categories: policy conclusions, business conclusion and research conclusions.\n\nPolicy conclusions:\n\n  - Development of support models for weak links in cyber-space is a competitive advantage. Public\nauthorities would need to foster end-point protection by:\n\n[380https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/478933/52309_Cm_9161_NSS_S](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/478933/52309_Cm_9161_NSS_SD_Review_web_only.pdf)\n\n[D_Review_web_only.pdf, accessed November 2015.](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/478933/52309_Cm_9161_NSS_SD_Review_web_only.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\n| January 2016\n\n  - Issuing market guidance based on cyber-threat mitigation measures. This is particularly important\nfor interconnected systems used for the management of vital/critical physical phenomena (Internet\nof Things).\n\n  - Develop end-user trainings that are based on the current threat landscape and are free of technical\ndetails.\n\n  - Disseminate threat mitigation good practices.\n\n- Intensify and re-engineer available incident and data breach report schemes to effectively capture\ninformation about cyber-threats and involved threat agents. Results from this scheme should be\ndisseminated to stakeholders by means of lessons learned from security breaches.\n\n- In a similar manner to emergency and crisis-management, public sector should examine the feasibility\nof mobilizing citizens to support community in cyber-defence. Such roles would be similar to civilprotection, and would be activated in cyber-crises.\n\n- Develop threat intelligence for the governmental organisations and apply state-of-the-art cyber-threat\nintelligence approaches within all relevant authorities.\n\nBusiness conclusions:\n\n- The cyber-threat landscape needs to be disseminated to all kind of stakeholders. Cyber-threat\ninformation needs to be made consumable by executives, non-expert user and end-users. It needs to\nbecome non-technical and translated into concrete actions to be undertaken.\n\n- Businesses in the area of cyber-security need to elaborate on threat agent models and create threat\nagent intelligence based on proactive, real/near-time and reactive information. This kind of\ninformation is of high value in risk assessment and in the definition of protection requirements.\n\n- Businesses in the area of technology should look for ways to extract/discover information from dark\nnet/dark web. This might include crawlers, data mining tools, pattern matching tools, etc. The\nobjective would be to develop a better understanding about the dynamics of dark net and collect\ninformation about threat agents.\n\n- Given the longevity of vulnerabilities in cyber-space, it seems that current vulnerability management\npractices are not efficient. Businesses in the cyber-security sector should find methods to support\nusers in managing vulnerabilities at end-points.\n\n- Not more, but better quality information about threats is needed. Organisations should focus on\ncreation of context from incident and cyber-threat data. This context should be structured and shared\naccording to individual needs of target groups.\n\nResearch conclusions:\n\n- Research in applied statistics and metrics for impact of incidents as well as statistic models for threats\naccording to detection and materialization levels are necessary. They contribute to the comparability\nof cyber-threats and can provide homogeneous quantitative evidence for the threat landscape.\n\n- Research on new models for the seamless and intuitive operation and management of security\ncontrols is necessary. Such models would target technically novices who will need to user ubiquitous\ncomputing applications in home environments, e-health and transportation. Hiding the complexity\nwhile keeping the efficiency of security controls is a means to reduce exposure in these emerging\ntechnology areas, especially in cases that they might impact human life.\n\n\n-----\n\n| January 2016\n\n- Research is necessary in order to develop trust models for the establishment of ad hoc\ninterconnections among devices in application scenarios, in particular related to the Internet of Things\nand Industry 4.0. Access to and exchange of confidential information will be performed on the basis of\nthe trust level negotiated.\n\n\n-----\n\n| January 2016\n\n\n### Annex A: Comparison ENISA and STIX data models\n\n|Attributes-Collection:|Col2|Col3|\n|---|---|---|\n|STIX|Description|ENISA|\n|-|-|High level Threat|\n|incident:Title|The Title field provides a simple title for this Incident.|Threat|\n|incident:Description|This field characterizes a single cyber threat Incident.|Threat Detail|\n|incident:Affected_Asset|The Affected_Assets field is optional and characterizes the particular assets affected during the Incident.|Affected Asset Type|\n|-|-|Affected Business Sector|\n|-|-|Emerging technology area|\n|Threat Actor|ThreatActors are characterizations of malicious actors (or adversaries) representing a cyber-attack threat including presumed intent and historically observed behaviour.|Threat Agent|\n|incident:Information_Source|The Information_Source field details the source of this entry.|Relevant Reference|\n|incident:Information_Source|The Information_Source field details the source of this entry.|Trend|\n|incident:Information_Source|The Information_Source field details the source of this entry.|Relevant URL|\n|Attributes Threat Agents:|||\n|STIX|Description|ENISA|\n|ta:Description|The Description field is optional and provides an unstructured, text description of this ThreatActor.|Description|\n|ta:Motivation|The Type field characterizes the motivations of this threat actor.
