We will discuss this later in the article.\n\n## The Mailto / Netwalker ransomware\n\n\n-----\n\nIn a recent sample of the Mailto ransomware shared with BleepingComputer by\n[MalwareHunterTeam, the executable attempts to impersonate the 'Sticky Password'](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam)\nsoftware.\n\n**Impersonating Sticky Password**\n\nWhen executed, the ransomware uses an embedded config that includes the ransom note\ntemplate, ransom note file names, length of id/extension, whitelisted files, folders, and\nextensions, and various other configuration options.\n\n[According to Head of SentinelLabs Vitali Kremez who also](https://twitter.com/VK_Intel) [analyzed the ransomware, the](https://twitter.com/VK_Intel/status/1225086186445733889?s=20)\nconfiguration is quite sophisticated and detailed compared to other ransomware infections.\n\n\"The ransomware and its group have one of the more granular and more sophisticated\nconfigurations observed,\" Kremez told BleepingComputer.\n\n[The configuration that was embedded in the analyzed sample can be found here.](https://pastebin.com/hZPqJdEh)\n\n\n-----\n\n**Ransomware config**\nWhile almost all current ransomware infections utilize a whitelist of folders, files, and\nextensions that will be skipped, Mailto utilizes a much longer list of whitelisted folders and\nfiles than we normally see.\n\nFor example, below is the list of folders that will be skipped from being encrypted.\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n system volume information\n*windows.old\n*:\\users\\*\\*temp\n*msocache\n*:\\winnt\n*$windows.~ws\n*perflogs\n*boot\n*:\\windows\n*:\\program file*\n\\vmware\n\\\\*\\users\\*\\*temp\n\\\\*\\winnt nt\n\\\\*\\windows\n*\\program file*\\vmwaree\n*appdata*microsoft\n*appdata*packages\n*microsoft\\provisioning\n*dvd maker\n*Internet Explorer\n*Mozilla\n*Old Firefox data\n*\\program file*\\windows media*\n*\\program file*\\windows portable*\n*windows defender\n*\\program file*\\windows nt\n*\\program file*\\windows photo*\n*\\program file*\\windows side*\n*\\program file*\\windowspowershell\n*\\program file*\\cuas*\n*\\program file*\\microsoft games\n*\\program file*\\common files\\system em\n*\\program file*\\common files\\*shared\n*\\program file*\\common files\\reference ass*\n*\\windows\\cache*\n*temporary internet*\n*media player\n*:\\users\\*\\appdata\\*\\microsoft\n\\\\*\\users\\*\\appdata\\*\\microsoft\n\n```\nWhen encrypting files, the Mailto ransomware will append an extension using the\nformat .mailto[{mail1}].{id}. For example, a file named 1.doc will be encrypted and renamed\nto 1.doc.mailto[sevenoneone@cock.li].77d8b as seen below.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Encrypted Files**\nThe ransomware will also create ransom notes named using the file name format of {ID}Readme.txt. For example, in our test run the ransom note was named 77D8B-Readme.txt.\n\nThis ransom note will contain information on what happened to the computer and two email\naddresses that can be used to get the payment amount and instructions.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Mailto / Netwalker Ransom Note**\nThis ransomware is still being analyzed and it is not known if there are any weaknesses in\nthe encryption algorithm that can be used to decrypt files for free. If anything is discovered,\nwe will be sure to let everyone know.\n\nFor now, those who are infected can discuss this ransomware and receive support in our\n[dedicated Mailto / Netwalker Ransomware Support & Help Topic.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/t/705981/mailto-netwalker-ransomware-support-help-topic-mailto-readmetxt/)\n\n## Is it named Mailto or Netwalker?\n\nWhen new ransomware infections are found, the discoverer or researchers will typically\nlook for some indication as to the name given to it by the ransomware developer.\n\nWhen a ransomware does not provide any clues as to its name, in many cases the\nransomware will be named after the extension appended to encrypted files.\n\nAs the Mailto ransomware did not have any underlying hints as to its real name, at the time\nof discovery it was just called Mailto based on the extension.\n\nSoon after, [Coveware discovered a decryptor for the ransomware that indicated that the](https://twitter.com/coveware)\ndeveloper's name for the infection is 'Netwalker'.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Netwalker**\n\n**Decrypter**\nIn situations like this, it is difficult to decide what name we should continue to call the\nransomware.\n\nOn one hand, we clearly know its name is Netwalker, but on the other hand, the victims\nknow it as Mailto and most of the helpful information out there utilizes that name.\n\nTo make it easier for victims, we decided to continue to refer to this ransomware as Mailto,\nbut the names can be used interchangeably\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Windows 11 KB5014019 breaks Trend Micro ransomware protection](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-11-kb5014019-breaks-trend-micro-ransomware-protection/)\n\n[Industrial Spy data extortion market gets into the ransomware game](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/industrial-spy-data-extortion-market-gets-into-the-ransomware-game/)\n\n[New ‘Cheers’ Linux ransomware targets VMware ESXi servers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-cheers-linux-ransomware-targets-vmware-esxi-servers/)\n\n[SpiceJet airline passengers stranded after ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/spicejet-airline-passengers-stranded-after-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[US Senate: Govt’s ransomware fight hindered by limited reporting](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-senate-govt-s-ransomware-fight-hindered-by-limited-reporting/)\n\n## IOCs\n\n### Hashes:\n```\n416556c9f085ae56e13f32d7c8c99f03efc6974b2897070f46ef5f9736443e8e\n\n Associated files:\n{ID}-Readme.txt\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n### Mailto email addresses:\n```\nsevenoneone@cock.li\nkavariusing@tutanota.com\n\n Ransom note text:\nHi!\nYour files are encrypted.\nAll encrypted files for this computer has extension: .{id}\n-If for some reason you read this text before the encryption ended,\nthis can be understood by the fact that the computer slows down, \nand your heart rate has increased due to the ability to turn it off,\nthen we recommend that you move away from the computer and accept that you have been\ncompromised,\nrebooting/shutdown will cause you to lose files without the possibility of recovery\nand even god will not be able to help you,\nit could be files on the network belonging to other users, sure you want to take\nthat responsibility?\n-Our encryption algorithms are very strong and your files are very well protected,\nyou can't hope to recover them without our help.\nThe only way to get your files back is to cooperate with us and get the decrypter\nprogram.\nDo not try to recover your files without a decrypt program, you may damage them and\nthen they will be impossible to recover.\nWe advise you to contact us as soon as possible, otherwise there is a possibility\nthat your files will never be returned.\nFor us this is just business and to prove to you our seriousness, we will decrypt\nyou some files for free, \nbut we will not wait for your letter for a long time, mail can be abused, we are\nmoving on, hurry up with the decision.\nСontact us:\n1.{mail1}\n2.{mail2}\nDon't forget to include your code in the email:\n{code}\n\n```\n[Enterprise](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/enterprise/)\n[Mailto](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/mailto/)\n[Netwalker](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/netwalker/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\n\n-----\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
