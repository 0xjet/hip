Instead, the company itself initiated a\ncontrolled shutdown of operations as a precautionary matter to prevent critical ICS-related\n[and product tracking or billing systems from being impacted by the ransomware event. Yet](https://twitter.com/kimzetter/status/1392923544753872896)\neven though the criminal entities responsible did not or were unable to directly modify,\ndisable, or otherwise disrupt ICS equipment, Colonial operators and defenders believed\nthere was a non-zero chance such action could take place.\n\n\n-----\n\nBased on the above circumstances, many persons asked a seemingly simple question: why\nwere critical control system devices even accessible from Colonial’s IT network in the first\nplace, resulting in the precautionary shutdown? This question brings ICS-related security\n[back to the discussion of the “air gap.” Frequently lauded as an impenetrable standard in](https://www.tofinosecurity.com/blog/1-ics-and-scada-security-myth-protection-air-gap)\nsecuring sensitive networks but nearly always misunderstood, an air gap – physical\nseparation and lack of any connectivity between the sensitive network and all other networks\n– provides a deceptively easy solution for network defense. Yet further exploration of just\nwhat an air gap entails and how to actually implement one rapidly demonstrates that,\nalthough applicable in certain situations, as a general security practice (even in critical\ninfrastructure environments) this practice rapidly becomes untenable.\n\nFirst, what is an air gap? As described briefly above, an air gap represents the complete,\nphysical isolation of a given network from all other networks. Only through physically bridging\nthe network, such as through the introduction of removable media, can data flow in or out of\nthe network in question. While not completely secure, as there are multiple known instances\nof [self-propagating or](https://www.wired.com/images_blogs/threatlevel/2010/11/w32_stuxnet_dossier.pdf) [air gap-jumping intrusions going back nearly two decades, such](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/29/a-decade-after-russia-hacked-the-pentagon-trump-unshackles-cyber-command-961103)\nabsolute segmentation will defeat the vast majority of network intrusions by virtue of simply\nnot having an accessible network in place. Yet as tantalizing as this seems, actual, true “air\ngapped” networks are exceedingly rare, and frequently contain links, whether intentional via\n[diodes or unintentional via “shadow IT,” that make cross-domain traffic possible.](https://www.forcepoint.com/cyber-edu/shadow-it)\n\n\n-----\n\nFor example, there is an assumption that classified networks, such as those used by US\nmilitary and intelligence communities, are air gapped from the wider internet. Yet if we think\nof the definition of air gap – complete, physical segmentation – it rapidly becomes clear that\nthis is simply not possible. Short of building a completely separate system of communication\nlinks (fiber, undersea cables, etc.) and avoiding all “over the air” transmission (satellite\ncommunications, wireless, etc.), the systems cannot be air gapped. Given that the US\ngovernment does not operate a completely parallel internet, traffic from these networks “comingles” on public lines. While the traffic may be secured, and ingress and egress to on-site\nnetworks controlled via security solutions and diodes, traffic does exist and “cross-domain”\ntraffic is possible, even if exceedingly difficult to achieve.\n\nThe problem with the above scenario, and what prevents the creation of an actual air gap for\nsensitive networks, is the distributed nature of the organizations involved. In order to enable\nnot just networking within CIA headquarters or the Pentagon, but to extend such\ncommunication (including sensitive communication) to ships at sea and Forward Operating\nBases (FOBs) in Afghanistan, connectivity outside a plausible, possible air gap environment\nmust exist. Even something as seemingly isolated as a submarine still has connectivity to a\nnetwork – via VLF signals while deeply submerged and via various over-the-air signals\n(connecting to various networks, tactical or otherwise) when surfaced or floating a\ncommunications buoy.\n\n\n-----\n\nHowever, some environments exist where true air gaps are not only plausible, but actually\n[required. The standard example is reactor control for nuclear power generation. While other](https://www.nei.org/resources/reports-briefs/cybersecurity-for-nuclear-power-plants)\nelements of nuclear power stations, such as those items directly interfacing with the overall\nelectric system, will be networked (for reasons we’ll explore shortly), reactor control systems\nare required to be isolated in nearly all countries that operate such facilities. Combined with\n[significant passive engineering safety controls, the actual reactor environment is designed to](https://www.iaea.org/topics/design-safety-nuclear-power-plants/passive-safety-features)\nbe operated as a completely isolated system, with strict measures in place for the\nintroduction of outside material (e.g., software updates). Yet this environment represents\nsomething that the overall US military network is not: a single, centralized, specialized\nenvironment that can meaningfully be isolated from other systems. So long as heat can be\nexchanged and steam generated (indirectly, as in the [pressurized water reactor), the reactor](https://www.iaea.org/topics/design-safety-nuclear-power-plants/passive-safety-features)\ncan “communicate” all that it needs to drive turbines and generate electricity with no further\nintervention needed.\n\nWhat about pipelines, such as Colonial? To understand why an air gap is nonsensical in this\ncase, we need to understand that a pipeline consists of multiple, communicating components\nwhich must work together as a system to enable monitored, safe, reliable operations. The\n[combination of pipeline collection, gate station, and](https://www.aga.org/natural-gas/delivery/how-does-the-natural-gas-delivery-system-work-/) [compressor station components must](https://www.enbridge.com/about-us/natural-gas-transmission-and-midstream/natural-gas-101/transporting-natural-gas/compressor-stations)\ncommunicate to a [control center to govern the entire system, with sensor data and other](https://www.aboutpipelines.com/en/blog/behind-the-scenes-in-a-pipeline-control-room/)\nfeeds enabling visibility into operations. For a commercial pipeline that is thousands of miles\nlong with hundreds of such facilities, an “air gapped network” is simply implausible, and if\nimplemented would likely introduce sufficient operational friction and delay as to make\noperations less efficient and potentially even less safe. Short of building an entirely selfcontained, geographically distributed network for the pipeline, a true air gap is at minimum\nprohibitively expensive. When combined with the need to communicate with suppliers and\ncustomers at machine speeds during product transfer and delivery, the air gap would need to\nbe extended even further to up- and down-stream environments. In short, aside from building\na completely separate, dedicated internet covering the entire oil and gas sector, along with\nsubstantial portions of electric generation, it is simply infeasible to implement a true air gap in\npipeline (and related) environments.\n\nOne key aspect of this discussion is that critical infrastructure systems are rarely single point,\nisolated items in physical and network space. Like the pipeline and defense network\nexamples above, the electric system (or “grid”) is similar in that it consists of multiple,\n[interlocking and interdependent components from generation to transmission to distribution](https://learn.pjm.com/electricity-basics/transmission-distribution)\nto function properly. Monitoring and communication at machine speeds enable for rapid\nresponses and corrections to worrying or damaging conditions such as frequency or phase\n[anomalies that may imperil synchronization, or the disruptions created through interruptions](https://electrical-engineering-portal.com/preparing-to-synchronize-a-generator-to-the-grid)\nin any part of the system. While it is possible to run such systems through pure physical\n[controls, with fully manned substations and legacy electromechanical relays among other](https://www.electronics-notes.com/articles/electronic_components/electrical-electronic-relay/what-is-a-relay-basics.php)\nitems, such operations are significantly less efficient, more expensive, and in most situations\n[less safe than a modern Energy Management System (EMS) remotely coordinating multiple](https://www.se.com/us/en/work/solutions/for-business/electric-utilities/energy-management-system-ems/)\n[elements of physical grid operations with safety and protection provided by digital protective](https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-digital-protective-relay)\n\n\n-----\n\n[relays. As with the other examples, the only way to air gap this network would be to build](https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-digital-protective-relay)\nan entire dedicated network encompassing the entire electric system, from the largest\npublicly listed utility company to the smallest local distribution cooperative.\n\nWhile air gaps are largely irrelevant, impossible, and even undesirable in many instances,\nwe must recognize that connectivity and utilizing common infrastructure for communications\nstill poses risks. Vocal proponents of air gap implementation will use a false dichotomy to\nargue their point, attempting to convince those with less knowledge of these systems that\ncircumstances resemble an “all or nothing” proposition between complete connectivity and\ncomplete isolation. Yet this is ridiculous and hardly representative of reality. As discussed\nwith the military and intelligence network situation, you can have (reasonably) secure\ncommunications with a FOB in Central Asia from suburban DC provided the link and its\ncomponents are properly established.\n\nWhile a pipeline operator or water utility may not require that extreme level of security seen\n[in protecting JWICS or other networks, relatively simple and widely available solutions can at](https://www.fifthdomain.com/battlefield-tech/it-networks/2019/08/21/why-the-intelligence-community-wants-to-improve-its-top-secret-intranet/)\nleast work to ensure attackers cannot hit Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) directly\nfrom the internet, and limit exposure in cases like the Colonial event. Short of deploying\ndiodes and similar technology, robust network segmentation and authentication schema,\nsuch as use of a Virtual Private Network (VPN) with Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA),\ncombined with fundamental Network Security Monitoring (NSM) will yield profound\nimprovements in communication design.\n\nThe problem is not that PLCs and related equipment are accessible, it is that they are trivially\naccessible in many instances, such as the various intrusions into water treatment facilities in\nthe [US and](https://pylos.co/2021/02/09/water-water-everywhere-but-nary-a-hacker-to-blame/) [Israel over the past year. That critical infrastructure devices can be enumerated](https://www.otorio.com/blog/what-we-ve-learned-from-the-december-1st-attack-on-an-israeli-water-reservoir/)\nvia Shodan and directly accessed over the internet or from corporate IT networks is not a\nsign that such devices need to be air gapped. Rather it is evidence that such networks must\nbe better designed and introduce improved controls. Once adversaries demonstrate the\nability to consistently and easily subvert properly deployed VPNs and robust MFA\nimplementation, then we as defenders and asset operators can talk about more robust\nsolutions. Even then, something approaching the military model, of secure and encrypted\ncommunications tunneled over public networks, will likely be preferable than a true air gap\nsolution necessitating the construction of a dedicated critical infrastructure network spanning\ncontinents.\n\nOverall, critical infrastructure security has problems, and the Colonial Pipeline ransomware\nincident shows what several of them look like. But instead of immediately clamoring for an\nabsolutist remedy that would be prohibitively difficult (and likely impossible) to implement, we\nas defenders and decision-makers should instead consider solutions closer-to-hand first. By\napplying fairly standard controls and network design principles, many of the supposed\nbenefits of air gapped installations can be realized while also retaining the significant benefits\nof connectivity and communication over existing network infrastructure.\n\n\n-----",
