This attack impacted organizations worldwide,\nleading executives everywhere to question whether their environment fell victim.\n\n[Watch the Webinar](https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/7451/469525)\n\nclose-up of hands on laptop keyboard\nON DEMAND WEBINAR\n\n## Threat Research Blog\n\nHighly Evasive Attacker Leverages SolarWinds Supply Chain to Compromise Multiple Global\nVictims With SUNBURST Backdoor.\n\n[Read the Blog](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-with-sunburst-backdoor)\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n**What is Sunburst?**\nThis is a threat actor cluster that we are tracking, and the behavior is consistent with nationstate activity. The actors behind this campaign gained access to numerous public and private\norganizations around the world. They gained access to victims via trojanized updates to\nSolarWinds Orion IT monitoring and management software.\n\n**What are the motivations of this actor?**\n\n\n-----\n\nUNC2452 main motivations are likely espionage by exfiltrating data. So far, no indicators of\nextortion or financial crime have been discovered by the actor. Also, the actor leveraged\nSunburst malware (see below) and does not have any connotation to known ransomware.\n\n**What is the timeline of activity?**\nThe campaign we have uncovered appears to have begun as early as Spring 2020 and is\ncurrently ongoing. The campaign is the work of a highly skilled actor, and the operation was\nconducted with significant operational security. Based on our analysis, the attacks that we\nbelieve have been conducted as part of this campaign share certain common elements.\n\n**Who is responsible for this?**\nWe were tracking the actors behind this campaign as UNC2452, which references to an\n“uncategorized”\ngroup in our intel naming schema. In April 2022, we merged UNC2452 into APT29.\nUNC2452 activity is now attributed to APT29.\n\n**Who was affected by this?**\nThis is a global campaign that introduced a compromise into public and private\norganizations; networks through the software supply chain. At this point in our investigation,\nwe have detected this activity in multiple entities worldwide. The victims have included\ngovernment, consulting, technology, healthcare, telecom, and oil and gas entities in North\nAmerica, Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. There may be additional victims in other\ncountries and verticals.\n\n**How did this affect FireEye?**\nBased on the latest findings from our investigation, we determined the SolarWinds\ncompromise was the original vector for the attack against FireEye. We believe that this is the\ninitial attack vector after which they used other sophisticated techniques to penetrate and\nremain hidden in our network. Through the combination of our technology, intelligence, and\nexpertise, we uncovered the SUNBURST campaign.\n\n**Does this affect FireEye products?**\nNo. We have already updated our products to detect the known altered SolarWinds binaries.\nWe are also scanning for any traces of activity by this actor and reaching out to customers if\nwe see potential indicators.\n\n**How was the intrusion detected?**\nThe intrusion was detected by monitoring secondary registrations of our Two-Factor\nauthentication and reporting on suspicious behavior.\n\n## Free Resources\n\nOpen-source Github repositories with Sunburst threat detection signatures.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe ve made these resources free to the public to help you detect any indicators of UNC2452\nor Sunburst-related activity. For a detailed description of techniques used by UNC2452 see\nour blog and additional technical details.\n\n## Mandiant Azure AD Investigator\n\nThis repository contains a PowerShell module for detecting artifacts that may be indicators of\nUNC2452 and other threat actor activity.\n\n[View on GitHub](https://github.com/Mandiant/Mandiant-Azure-AD-Investigator)\n\n## Mandiant Red Team Tool Countermeasures\n\nThis repository includes rules categorized as production and supplemental release states in\nSnort, Yara, ClamAV, and HXIOC.\n\n[View on GitHub](https://github.com/Mandiant/red_team_tool_countermeasures)\n\n## Mandiant Sunburst Countermeasures\n\nThis repository includes rules categorized as production and supplemental release states in\nSnort, Yara, ClamAV, and HXIOC.\n\n[View on GitHub](https://github.com/Mandiant/sunburst_countermeasures)\n\n## Mandiant Advantage\n\nOrganizations currently using SolarWinds Orion IT need to see if they are compromised with\nthe Sunburst backdoor and seek further evidence.
