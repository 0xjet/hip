For the past three weeks it has spammed\nemails with a malicious PDF attachment that drops a word document with a macro that, in\nturn, downloads rebranded ransomware. The chart below, which is data from our Spam\nResearch Database, shows the daily spam received from the previous weeks to present. In\ntypical Necurs fashion, you can see the short high volume bursts.\n\nThe campaign uses various subjects in the spammed emails.\n\nWeek 1 (May 11-12)\n\n\n-----\n\nScanned image\n\nReceipt to print\n\nFile_ {random numbers}\n\nCopy_{random numbers}\n\nDocument_{random numbers}\n\nPDF_{random numbers}\n\nScan_{random numbers}\n\nWeek 2 (May 15 -17)\n\nYour Invoice # {random numbers}\n\nXX_Invoice_XXXX\n\nEmailing: {random numbers}.pdf\n\nInvoice {random numbers} {mm/dd/yyy}\n\nWeek 3 (May 22-25)\n\nInvoice(XX-XXXX)\n\nCopy of Invoice {random numbers}\n\nIMG_XXXX.pdf\n\nPayment Receipt XXX\n\nPayment Receipt#XXX\n\nPayment Receipt_XXX\n\nPayment XXX\n\nPayment#XXX\n\nPayment_XXX\n\nPayment-XXX\n\nReceipt XXX\n\nReceipt#XXX\n\nReceipt_XXX\n\nReceipt-XXX\n\n_***Note that X is any random number_\n\nSample emails:\n\n1st week\n\n\n-----\n\n2nd week\n\n3rd week\n\nThe PDF campaigns have been evolving, almost daily. Recent documents have a larger\nnumber of embedded files inside the pdf. These additional files do nothing, and are\nprobably just decoys. But the main.docm file, with its malicious macro, still acts as the\nmalware downloader. Below you can see how the Trustwave Secure Email Gateway sees\nthese messages. Note the docm file with its vbaProject macro component.\n\n1st and 2nd Week 3rd Week\n\n\n-----\n\nSaving and opening the PDF attachment, as shown below, has an exportDataObject\nLaunch instruction to open the embedded .docm file\n\nThe PDF File will drop and launch the embedded .docm file\n\n\n-----\n\nIf the macro is enabled, it will start to download a malicious file from URL which is the Jaff\nRansomware. The table below shows differences from variants from week to week:\n\n1st and 2nd Week 3rd Week\n\nDropped ransom notes on every folder that it encrypted\nfiles in it, the image file was also used as a desktop\nwallpaper once ransomware done encrypting your files.\n\n\n-----\n\nReadme.bmp\n\nReadMe.html\n\nReadMe.txt\n\nEncrypted files will have an appended file extension\n\n\nREADME_TO_DECRYPTl.bmp\n\nReadMe.html\n\nREADME_TO_DECRYPTl.txt\n\n\n{Original FileName}.jaff {Original FileName}.wlu\n\n\n-----\n\nEven though the appearance is different, both variants\nhave the same URL where you are able to recover your\nencrypted files.\n\nEarlier versions asks for 2.01 BTC and later versions it\nonly asks for 0.31 BTC\n\nTo conclude Necurs is a large botnet and when active it distributes massive volumes of\nmalicious spam. As observed, it tends to take breaks on weekends and it currently has an\nongoing campaign using malicious PDFs to download Jaff ransomware. These malicious\nPDFs are continuously evolving by adding more layers of embedded files and obfuscation.\n\nThe Trustwave Secure Email Gateway can recognize and block this threat.\n\nMD5 hashes of the malware:\n\n**PDF Droppers**\n\nd364eb043e01f61822c9d2906a36ad2f902c60d7\n\n8e4f36e0710aee26f125acc69b14cac44467238f\n\n2001971c7ddaa9b2550d1b870f5e377c56f15f70\n\n**DOC Downloaders**\n\nee4fef6b870d0baa3a503aa8594dc16920f7b8a3\n\nf66680aac290ad5febd6bc5b40efe16817bd6850\n\n5045d532a951af205d0e0d91805b2bc38ee6aedd\n\n**Jaff Ransomware 1**\n\n03b17da93cf91f61c9dbb4d25182016cefec0659\n\n\n-----\n\n**Jaff Ransomware 2**\n551f953db4ba48452a4f7de9f5f7149c98ddf52f\n\n\n-----",
