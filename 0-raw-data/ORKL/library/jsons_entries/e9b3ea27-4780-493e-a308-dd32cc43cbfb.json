    "plain_text": "# The Ideal Ransomware Victim: What Attackers Are Looking For\n\n**[ke-la.com/the-ideal-ransomware-victim-what-attackers-are-looking-for/](https://ke-la.com/the-ideal-ransomware-victim-what-attackers-are-looking-for/)**\n\nSeptember 6, 2021\n\nIn July 2021, KELA observed threat actors creating multiple threads where they claimed they\nare ready to buy accesses and described their conditions. Some of them appear to use\naccess for deploying info-stealing malware and carrying out other malicious activities. Others\naim to plant ransomware and steal data. KELA explored what is valuable for threat actors\nbuying accesses, especially ransomware attackers, and built a profile of an ideal\nransomware victim.\n\nBottom line up front:\n\n**In July 2021, KELA found 48 active threads where actors claimed they are**\n**looking to buy different kinds of accesses. 46% of them were created in that month,**\nillustrating the demand for access listings.\n**40% of the actors who were looking to buy accesses were identified as active**\n**participants in the ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) supply chain – operators, or**\n**affiliates, or middlemen.**\n\n\n-----\n\nRansomware attackers appear to form industry standards defining an ideal victim\nbased on its revenue and geography and excluding certain sectors and countries from\nthe targets list. On average, the actors active in July 2021 aimed to buy access to\n**US companies with revenue of more than 100 million USD. Almost half of them**\n**refused to buy access to companies from the healthcare and education**\n**industries.**\nRansomware attackers are ready to buy all kinds of network accesses, with RDP and\nVPN being the most basic requirement. The most common products (enabling\n**network access) mentioned were Citrix, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Fortinet,**\n**and Cisco.**\n**Ransomware attackers are ready to pay for access up to 100,000 USD, with most**\n**actors setting the boundaries at half of that price – 56,250 USD.**\nThe similarities between ransomware-related actors’ requirements for victims and\naccess listings and conditions for IABs illustrate that RaaS operations act just like\ncorporate enterprises.\n\n## What Access Are Threat Actors Chasing\n\nIn total, KELA found 48 threads dedicated to buying accesses that were created or observed\nbeing active in July 2021. Almost half of them were created in July alone, showing an\nimpressive pace and demand for access listings (with active meaning they had one or more\n\n\n-----\n\nupdates from their creators in a thread). It begs the question – what access are the actors\nlooking for and what is their ultimate goal?\n\nFirst of all, it is important to understand that threat actors behind the announcements do not\nnecessarily mean network access when they say “access”. It is a term that is used in a very\nloose manner to describe multiple different vectors and entry points – from SQL injection and\nwebshells to RDP- and VPN- based access. Analyzing the active threads dedicated to\nbuying accesses, KELA found that in addition to initial network accesses sold by Initial\nAccess Brokers (IABs), they included access to online shops’ panels, unprotected\ndatabases, Microsoft Exchange servers, and more. All these types of access are\nundoubtedly dangerous and can enable threat actors to perform various malicious actions,\nbut they rarely provide access to a corporate network.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Sections dedicated to accesses on XSS and Exploit cybercrime forums_\n\nTherefore, researching the actors’ demands and their dark web activity, KELA determined\nthat the actors behind the analyzed threads usually intended to exploit the access for all\nkinds of malicious activities, including information-stealing (from deploying info-stealing\nmalware to injecting malicious scripts into websites), cryptocurrency mining, spam and\nphishing campaigns.\n\n_A user explaining how to use access via shells for malicious purposes_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Threat actors looking for accesses to abuse them to deploy sniffers or send e-mail spam_\n\nHowever, one threat obviously stands out. Almost 40% of the analyzed threads were\n**created by actors related to Raas supply chain – operators, affiliates, or middlemen.**\nAs ransomware operations have been growing and maturing, KELA observed multiple\nransomware gangs using the IABs’ services. Announcements about buying accesses help\nthem to find each other and cooperate further. Some gangs, like BlackMatter and Avos, even\nsent an advertisement about them buying accesses in Jabber – apparently to all users\nregistered via XSS/Exploit Jabber services. Others, like Crylock ransomware representative,\nspecifically mentioned they are looking for constant sellers.\n\n\n-----\n\n_BlackMatter ransomware gang is looking for Initial Access Brokers both on forums and via Jabber_\n\n_Crylock ransomware gang is looking for constant suppliers of access_\n\n\n-----\n\nSuch posts are not new, though with the growth and diversification of the ransomware-as-aservice (RaaS) ecosystem they have become much more standardized. Instead of a simple\n“I’ll buy access”, threat actors now scrupulously list potential victims’ characteristics and\ntypes of access, knowing exactly what they want – i.e. to ease the attack and eventually\nreceive a ransom. KELA explored these metrics to find out what companies are in the\nransomware attackers’ target list.\n\n## Ransomware Attackers’ Requirements to IABs\n\nWhen describing the pricing model formed by IABs, KELA determined that it mainly depends\non the revenue and the size of the affected company, though geography sometimes plays a\ncertain role. The level of privileges in the compromised network also influences the prices\n(for example, a domain administrator account costs at least 10 times more than access to a\nmachine with user rights). Logically, the same metrics are important to ransomware actors\nsince IABs have always followed the needs of their customers.\n\nA typical ransomware actors’ advertisement includes the following characteristics of the\nvictim:\n\n**Geography**\n\nThe majority of requests mentioned the desired location of victims, with the US being the\n**most popular choice – 47% of the actors mentioned it. Other top locations included**\n**Canada (37%), Australia (37%), and European countries (31%). Most of the**\nadvertisements included a call for multiple countries. The reason behind this geographical\nfocus is that actors choose the most wealthy companies which are expected to be located in\nthe biggest and the most developed countries. For example, the LockBit 2.0 ransomware\n[representative said in his recent interview: “The bigger the company’s capitalization is – the](https://ke-la.com/lockbit-2-0-interview-with-russian-osint/)\nbetter. <..> It does not matter where the target is situated, we attack everyone.”\n\n\n-----\n\n**Revenue**\n\nTypically, the actors stated only the minimum desired revenue in attempts to cut off victims\nthat are unlikely to pay a significant ransom. The average minimum revenue wanted by\n**ransomware attackers is 100 million USD, with some of them stating that the desired**\n**revenue depends on the location. For example, one of the actors described the following**\nformula: revenue should be more than 5 million USD for US victims, more than 20 million\nUSD for European victims, and more than 40 million USD for “the third world” countries.\n\n\n-----\n\nA threat actor sets prices for accesses depending on the revenue of potential victims\n\n**Blacklist of sectors**\n\nA significant difference can be spotted between the advertisement of threat actors buying\naccess for ransomware attacks and cybercriminals with other specializations. Almost a half\nof ransomware-related threads included a blacklist of sectors, meaning that the actors are\nnot ready to buy access to companies from specific industries.\n\n**47% of ransomware attackers refused to buy access to companies from the healthcare**\n**and education industries. 37% prohibited compromising the government sector, while**\n**26% claimed they will not purchase access related to non-profit organizations. When**\nactors prohibit healthcare or non-profit industries offers, it is more likely due to the moral\ncode of the actors. When the education sector is off the table, the reason is the same or the\nfact that education victims simply cannot afford to pay much. Finally, when actors refuse to\ntarget government companies, it is a precaution measure and an attempt to avoid unwanted\nattention from law enforcement.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Blacklist of countries**\n\nFinally, some countries are out of ransomware attackers’ interests. Not surprisingly, it’s CIS,\naccording to the old Russian-speaking hackers’ rule “do not work in Ru” [in Russian speaking\ncountries – KELA]. The actors based in CIS suppose that if they will not target these\ncountries, local authorities will not hunt them. Other countries mentioned as “unwanted”\nincluded South America and third world countries – most likely due to low chances of getting\na financial gain.\n\n## Ransomware Attackers Budget for Accesses\n\nFor suitable victims, ransomware attackers are ready to buy all kinds of network accesses,\nwith RDP and VPN being the most basic requirement. Among wanted products (enabling\n**network access) they listed Citrix, Palo Alto Networks (specifically GlobalProtect**\n**VPN), VMware (specifically ESXi), Fortinet, and Cisco. As for the level of privileges, some**\nattackers stated they prefer domain admin rights, though it does not seem to be critical.\n\n\n-----\n\nAn actor associated with the Nefilim ransomware operation looks for various types of access\n\n**How much are ransomware attackers ready to pay for such access to defined**\n**companies? The range really varies, starting from 100 and ending with 100,000 USD.**\n**The average minimum and maximum prices for access are 1600 – 56,250 USD. In**\naddition, 32% of ransomware attackers are ready to pay a share of a ransom. As KELA\n[determined earlier, IABs can get around 10% of a ransom.](https://ke-la.com/ransomware-gangs-are-starting-to-look-like-oceans-11/)\n\n**The similarities between ransomware-related actors’ requirements for victims and**\n**access listings and conditions for IABs illustrate that RaaS operations act just like**\n**corporate enterprises. They form “ industry standards” with a blacklist of sectors and**\ncountries, define their “clients” revenue and geography, and offer a competitive price for\nthreat actors supplying them the desired “goods.” Confronting such organized cybercrime\nrequires more effort and visibility into the sources where ransomware-related actors look for\noutsourcing services and recruit partners and employees.\n\n## Mitigation measures for enterprise defenders\n\nDemand for access listings on cybercrime forums is growing, with more actors advertising\nthey are ready to buy entry points to networks, sites, storage, and more. This is another\nproof of continuing servitization of cybercrime, especially ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS)\noperations that rely on different specialists to perform their attacks. However, it is crucial to\n**remember that access to a company in the wrong hands may be exploited not only for**\n**deploying ransomware and stealing data but also for other malicious campaigns.**\n\n\n-----\n\nConfronting various threats require enterprise defenders to invest in:\n\n1. Cybersecurity awareness and training for all key stakeholders and employees to\n\nensure that key individuals know how to safely use their credentials and personal\ninformation online. This cyber training should include specifying how to identify\nsuspicious activities, such as possible scam emails, or unusual requests from\nunauthorized individuals or email addresses.\n2. Regular vulnerability monitoring and patching to continually protect their entire network\n\ninfrastructure and prevent any unauthorized access by Initial Access Brokers or other\nnetwork intruders.\n3. Targeted and automated monitoring of key assets to immediately detect threats\n\nemerging from the cybercrime underground ecosystem. Constant automated and\nscalable monitoring of an organization’s assets could significantly improve maintaining\na reduced attack surface, ultimately helping organizations thwart possible attempts of\ncyberattacks against them.\n\nVisit [lumint.ke-la.com to stay up to date with more insights on recent ransomware attacks as](https://lumint.ke-la.com/)\nwell as compromised network accesses listed for sale and leaked databases and data\ndumps.\n\n\n-----",
