Sykipot has been used in targeted attacks for at least the past couple of years,\nand unconfirmed traces date back to as early as 2006. The latest wave spiked on\nDecember 1, 2011 with a huge uptick of targeted entities being sent a PDF containing a\nzero-day exploit against Adobe Reader and Acrobat (CVE-2011-2462).\n\nSymantec classifies the set of Trojans used by these attackers as ‘Sykipot’ and includes\n[detection names such as JS.Sykipot and](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2010-031014-2034-99) [Backdoor.Sykipot.](http://www.symantec.com/business/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2010-031015-0224-99)\n\nThe goal of the attackers is to collect intellectual property and send it to a remote server of\ntheir choosing. Depending on the targeted organization the data could be design, financial,\nmanufacturing, or strategic planning information. The attackers involved in Sykipot have a\nhistory of attacking various industries, a majority of which belong to the defense industry.\n\nThis isn’t the first time the attackers have used a zero-day exploit either. In March 2010 the\nSykipot attackers leveraged a flaw in Internet Explorer—the Microsoft Internet Explorer\n'iepeers.dll' Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (BID 38615).\n\nThese attacks have been long running, persistent, and targeted, leading us to believe that\nthe attackers are well-funded and motivated to acquire specific, high-value information.\n\nThe companies attacked by this latest wave of Sykipot include, but aren’t limited to,\norganizations in the following market sectors, primarily based in the US or UK:\n\nDefense contractors\nTelecommunications\nComputer Hardware\nChemical\n\n\n-----\n\nEnergy\nGovernment Departments\n\nThe attackers consistently use targeted emails containing either a link or malicious\nattachment. In both cases, the attackers either exploit unpatched application flaws (zeroday exploits) or simply leverage known exploit code in the hopes that the targeted computer\nis running vulnerable software. One can see an example of such an email from earlier this\nmonth below.\n\nThe attackers spent a substantial amount of time researching information on the people\nthey intended to target. Intended recipients of malicious emails exploiting the Adobe\nAcrobat and Reader vulnerability were mostly high-ranking executives, including C-Level,\nVice-Presidents, and Directors within the organizations. These employees may have access\nto sensitive information and computers containing intellectual property of interest to the\nattackers. Furthermore, these employee’s computers, and the information gathered from\nthem, may be used to mount attacks on lower-level employees and the computers that hold\nthe desired information.\n\nThe attackers always used enticing file names for the Trojan, such as ‘[REMOVED]weapons.scr’, ‘[REMOVED]_af_navy.scr’, and ‘occupy-wall-street-[NUMBER].scr’.\n\nOnce a computer was compromised, we have observed the attackers initially issue\nreconnaissance commands to gather system and network information to determine if the\ncomputer was a host of interest to them. If so, the attackers would issue custom commands\nspecific to the compromised environment in order to locate and exfiltrate desired\ninformation.\n\n## Threat Details\n\nIn the recent attack, when the malicious PDF is opened, Sykipot is executed and the user is\nshown a copy of a clean PDF file before Skyipot is injected into the following processes:\n\niexplore.exe\noutlook.exe\nfirefox.exe\n\nThe Trojan is also copied to a local folder as a file named ‘pretty.exe’ with a compile date of\nNovember 22, 2011.\n\nThe Trojan DLL has a few supporting files which are copied into the local settings folder.\nThe file names and their functions are as follows:\n\n**File name** **Function**\n\n\n-----\n\nGtpretty.tmp Orders from the C&C\n\nGdtpretty.tmp Decrypted version of orders from the C&C\n\nPdtpretty.tmp Logfile\n\nPtpretty.tmp Encrypted version of logfile\n\nThis particular variant contacts the command and control server, www [dot] prettylikeher\n\n[dot] com, via HTTPS. In addition, another underlying encryption scheme is used that uses\nthe key 19990817 (this appears to be the date August 17, 1999).\n\nThe command and control server is configured to automatically send commands to instruct\nSykipot to send system and network information before attackers can issue custom\ncommands in order to locate and exfiltrate sensitive information.\n\n[Previous attacks performed similar actions, as can be seen here.](https://community.broadcom.com/symantecenterprise/viewdocument?DocumentKey=6d45cb18-8788-476b-87b4-693070f04381&CommunityKey=1ecf5f55-9545-44d6-b0f4-4e4a7f5f5e68&tab=librarydocuments)\n\nSykipot will continually ping the command and control server using the following GET\nrequests:\n```\nhttps://[C&C DOMAIN]/asp/kys_allow_get.asp?name=getkys.kys&hostname=\n[COMPUTER NAME]-[IP ADDRESS]-pretty20111122\n\n```\nIt also uses a hardcoded referer of ‘www.yahoo.com’ when making these HTTP requests.\n\nSykipot supports the following commands:\n\n**Command** **Function**\n\ncmd Execute command using CreateProcess and log results in configured log\nfile\n\ndoor This command supports five subcommands explained below\n\ntime Configure delay timer for C&C querying\n\ngetfile Download a file\n\nputfile Upload a file\n\nThe ‘door’ command allows five subcommands, such as the following:\n\n**Sub-Commands for ‘door’** **Function**\n\nshell Do nothing\n\nrun Executes a command using WinExec\n\n\n-----\n\nreboot Restarts the computer\n\nkill Ends a process\n\nprocess Not implemented\n\nIn addition to all of these commands, the Sykipot Trojan accepts an ‘-uninstall’ commandline switch that allows for it to be uninstalled. Doing so also ends the processes that were\ninjected by the malware.\n\nThe Sykipot samples analyzed also contain Chinese language error message strings that\nappear to correspond to a tool used to package the threat.\n\nThe English translation is:\n\nBinding document,\n\nRead the first file to bind error! Binding document,\n\nTo bind file to read the second error! Binding document,\n\nOpen the file you want to bind the second error! Binding document,\n\nOpen the first file to bind error! Binding document,\n\nCreate a binding file generated after synthesis Error! Binding document,\n\nError cannot locate the file itself! Binding document,\n\nCannot read the contents of their file error! Binding document,\n\nError opening the file itself! Binding document,\n\nError distribution of the length of the file itself! Binding document,\n\nIts zero-length file error! Error\n\nSome known Sykipot domains are as follows:\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned domains, we have data that leads us to believe the\nfollowing sites are also a part of this long-running campaign:\n\n## Attacker Profile\n\nAttributing the attack to a particular entity is generally difficult; however, long term\ncampaigns such as this one provide enough traits to give a rudimentary profile of the\nattackers.\n\nWhile the back door Trojan itself isn’t very sophisticated or well-coded, the attackers are\nskilled enough to have discovered multiple zero-day vulnerabilities. Given the long list of\ncommand and control servers being used for controlling the botnet, the attackers are\nunlikely to be a single person, but rather a group of people.\n\n\n-----\n\nThus, the Sykipot attackers are likely to be an organized and skilled group of individuals.\nGiven their persistence and their long-running campaigns, the attackers are likely to have\nconsistent funding for their efforts.\n\n## Summary\n\nThe goal of Sykipot attackers is to obtain sensitive documents to high level executives\nwithin a variety of target organizations, of which the vast majority have been defense\nrelated. Considering the long-running campaign history of the attackers and their previous\nuse of zero-day exploits, future versions of Sykipot that are delivered using another zero\nday are likely.\n\n[Symantec products detect Sykipot Trojan files as Backdoor.Sykipot, Files attempting to](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2010-031015-0224-99)\nexploit the [Adobe Acrobat and Reader U3D Memory Corruption Vulnerability (BID 50922)](http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/50922)\nare detected as Bloodhound.Exploit.439 and malicious PDFs trying to create and execute\nfiles are detected using SONAR proactively.\n\n\n-----",
