    "plain_text": "# A moment of reckoning: the need for a strong and global cybersecurity response\n\n**[blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/12/17/cyberattacks-cybersecurity-solarwinds-fireeye/](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/12/17/cyberattacks-cybersecurity-solarwinds-fireeye/)**\n\nDecember 18, 2020\n\nThe final weeks of a challenging year have proven even more difficult with the recent\nexposure of the world’s latest serious nation-state cyberattack. This latest cyber-assault is\neffectively an attack on the United States and its government and other critical institutions,\nincluding security firms. It illuminates the ways the cybersecurity landscape continues to\nevolve and become even more dangerous. As much as anything, this attack provides a\nmoment of reckoning. It requires that we look with clear eyes at the growing threats we face\nand commit to more effective and collaborative leadership by the government and the tech\nsector in the United States to spearhead a strong and coordinated global cybersecurity\nresponse.\n\n**The evolving threats**\n\nThe past 12 months have produced a watershed year with evolving cybersecurity threats on\nthree eye-opening fronts.\n\n**The first is the continuing rise in the determination and sophistication of nation-state**\n**attacks. In the past week this has again burst into the headlines with the story of an attack**\non the firm FireEye using malware inserted into network management software provided to\ncustomers by the tech company SolarWinds. This has already led to subsequent news\n\n\n-----\n\nreports of penetration into multiple parts of the U.S. Government. We should all be prepared\nfor stories about additional victims in the public sector and other enterprises and\n[organizations. As FireEye CEO Kevin Mandia stated after disclosing the recent attack, “We](https://www.cnet.com/news/fireeye-hack-cybersecurity-firm-says-nation-state-stole-attacking-tools/)\nare witnessing an attack by a nation with top-tier offensive capabilities.”\n\nAs Microsoft cybersecurity experts assist in the response, we have reached the same\nconclusion. The attack unfortunately represents a broad and successful espionage-based\nassault on both the confidential information of the U.S. Government and the tech tools used\nby firms to protect them. The attack is ongoing and is being actively investigated and\naddressed by cybersecurity teams in the public and private sectors, including Microsoft. As\nour teams act as first responders to these attacks, these ongoing investigations reveal an\nattack that is remarkable for its scope, sophistication and impact.\n\nThere are broader ramifications as well, which are even more disconcerting. First, while\ngovernments have spied on each other for centuries, the recent attackers used a technique\nthat has put at risk the technology supply chain for the broader economy. As SolarWinds has\n[reported, the attackers installed their malware into an upgrade of the company’s Orion](https://sec.report/Document/0001628280-20-017451/)\nproduct that may have been installed by more than 17,000 customers.\n\nThe nature of the initial phase of the attack and the breadth of supply chain vulnerability is\nillustrated clearly in the map below, which is based on telemetry from Microsoft’s Defender\nAnti-Virus software. This identifies customers who use Defender and who installed versions\nof SolarWinds’ Orion software containing the attackers’ malware. As this makes clear, this\naspect of the attack created a supply chain vulnerability of nearly global importance,\nreaching many major national capitals outside Russia. This also illustrates the heightened\nlevel of vulnerability in the United States.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe installation of this malware created an opportunity for the attackers to follow up and pick\nand choose from among these customers the organizations they wanted to further attack,\nwhich it appears they did in a narrower and more focused fashion. While investigations (and\nthe attacks themselves) continue, Microsoft has identified and has been working this week to\nnotify more than 40 customers that the attackers targeted more precisely and compromised\nthrough additional and sophisticated measures.\n\nWhile roughly 80% of these customers are located in the United States, this work so far has\nalso identified victims in seven additional countries. This includes Canada and Mexico in\nNorth America; Belgium, Spain and the United Kingdom in Europe; and Israel and the UAE\nin the Middle East. It’s certain that the number and location of victims will keep growing.\n\nAdditional analysis sheds added light on the breadth of these attacks. The initial list of\nvictims includes not only government agencies, but security and other technology firms as\nwell as non-governmental organizations, as shown in the chart below.\n\nIt’s critical that we step back and assess the significance of these attacks in their full context.\nThis is not “espionage as usual,” even in the digital age. Instead, it represents an act of\nrecklessness that created a serious technological vulnerability for the United States and the\nworld. In effect, this is not just an attack on specific targets, but on the trust and reliability of\nthe world’s critical infrastructure in order to advance one nation’s intelligence agency. While\nthe most recent attack appears to reflect a particular focus on the United States and many\nother democracies, it also provides a powerful reminder that people in virtually every country\nare at risk and need protection irrespective of the governments they live under.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs we have now seen repeatedly, Silicon Valley is not the only home of ingenious software\ndevelopers. Russian engineers in 2016 identified weaknesses in password protection and\nsocial media platforms, hacked their way into American political campaigns, and used\ndisinformation to sow divisions among the electorate. They repeated the exercise in the 2017\nFrench presidential campaign. As tracked by Microsoft’s Threat Intelligence Center and\nDigital Crimes Unit, these techniques have impacted victims in more than 70 countries,\nincluding most of the world’s democracies. The most recent attack reflects an unfortunate but\nsimilarly ingenious capability to identify weaknesses in cybersecurity protection and exploit\nthem.\n\nThese types of sophisticated nation-state attacks are increasingly being compounded by\nanother technology trend, which is the opportunity to augment human capabilities with\nartificial intelligence (AI). One of the more chilling developments this year has been what\nappears to be new steps to use AI to weaponize large stolen datasets about individuals and\nspread targeted disinformation using text messages and encrypted messaging apps. We\nshould all assume that, like the sophisticated attacks from Russia, this too will become a\npermanent part of the threat landscape.\n\nThankfully, there is a limited number of governments that can invest in the talent needed to\n[attack with this level of sophistication. In our first Microsoft Digital Defense Report, released](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/09/29/microsoft-digital-defense-report-cyber-threats/)\nin September, we reviewed our assessment of 14 nation-state groups involved in\ncybersecurity attacks. Eleven of the 14 are in only three countries.\n\n**All this is changing because of a second evolving threat, namely the growing**\n**privatization of cybersecurity attacks through a new generation of private companies,**\n**akin to 21st-century mercenaries. This phenomenon has reached the point where it has**\nacquired its own acronym – PSOAs, for private sector offensive actors. Unfortunately, this is\nnot an acronym that will make the world a better place.\n\nOne illustrative company in this new sector is the NSO Group, based in Israel and now\ninvolved in U.S. litigation. NSO created and sold to governments an app called Pegasus,\nwhich could be installed on a device simply by calling the device via WhatsApp; the device’s\nowner did not even have to answer. According to WhatsApp, NSO used Pegasus to access\nmore than 1,400 mobile devices, including those belonging to journalists and human rights\nactivists.\n\nNSO represents the increasing confluence between sophisticated private-sector technology\nand nation-state attackers. Citizen Lab, a research laboratory at the University of Toronto,\nhas [identified more than 100 abuse cases regarding NSO alone. But it is hardly alone. Other](https://citizenlab.ca/2019/10/nso-q-cyber-technologies-100-new-abuse-cases/)\ncompanies are increasingly rumored to be joining in what has become a new $12 billion\nglobal technology market.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis represents a growing option for nation-states to either build or buy the tools needed for\nsophisticated cyberattacks. And if there has been one constant in the world of software over\nthe past five decades, it is that money is always more plentiful than talent. An industry\nsegment that aids offensive cyberattacks spells bad news on two fronts. First, it adds even\nmore capability to the leading nation-state attackers, and second, it generates cyberattack\nproliferation to other governments that have the money but not the people to create their own\nweapons. In short, it adds another significant element to the cybersecurity threat landscape.\n\n**There is a third and final sobering development worth noting from what has obviously**\n**been a challenging year. This comes from the intersection between cyberattacks and**\n**COVID-19 itself.**\n\nOne might have hoped that a pandemic that cut short millions of lives might at least have\nreceived a pass from the world’s cyberattacks. But that was not the case. After a brief lull in\nMarch, cyberattackers took aim at hospitals and public health authorities, from local\ngovernments to the World Health Organization (WHO). As humanity raced to develop\n[vaccines, Microsoft security teams detected three nation-state actors targeting seven](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/11/13/health-care-cyberattacks-covid-19-paris-peace-forum/)\nprominent companies directly involved in researching vaccines and treatments for Covid-19.\nA crisis always seems to bring out the best and worst in people, so perhaps we should not\nbe surprised that this global crisis was no exception.\n\nPut together, however, these three trends point to a cybersecurity landscape that is even\nmore daunting than when the year began. The most determined nation-state attackers are\nbecoming more sophisticated. Risks are both growing and spreading to other governments\nthrough new private sector companies that aid and abet nation state attackers. And nothing,\nnot even a pandemic, is off limits to these attackers.\n\nWe live in a more dangerous world, and it requires a stronger and more coordinated\nresponse.\n\n**A more effective strategy as we enter a new year**\n\n**Put simply, we need a more effective national and global strategy to protect against**\n**cyberattacks. It will need multiple parts, but perhaps most important, it must start with the**\nrecognition that governments and the tech sector will need to act together.\n\nThe new year creates an opportunity to turn a page on recent American unilateralism and\nfocus on the collective action that is indispensable to cybersecurity protection. The United\nStates did not win World War II, the Cold War or even its own independence by fighting\nalone. In a world where authoritarian countries are launching cyberattacks against the\nworld’s democracies, it is more important than ever for democratic governments to work\ntogether – sharing information and best practices, and coordinating not just on cybersecurity\nprotection but on defensive measures and responses.\n\n\n-----\n\nUnlike attacks from the past, cybersecurity threats also require a unique level of collaboration\nbetween the public and private sectors. Today’s technology infrastructure, from data centers\nto fiberoptic cables, is most often owned and operated by private companies. These\nrepresent not only much of the infrastructure that needs to be secured but the surface area\nwhere new cyberattacks typically are first spotted. For this reason, effective cyber-defense\nrequires not just a coalition of the world’s democracies, but a coalition with leading tech\ncompanies.\n\nTo be successful, this coalition will need to do three things more effectively in the future:\n\n**_First, we need to take a major step forward in the sharing and analysis of threat_**\n**intelligence. In a new year that will mark the 20th anniversary of 9/11, we should remember**\n[one of the lessons from the tragic day that the 9/11 Commission called “a shock but not a](https://9-11commission.gov/report/911Report_Exec.pdf)\nsurprise.” A recurring theme of the commission’s findings was the inability across\ngovernment agencies to build collective knowledge by connecting data points together. The\ncommission therefore focused its first recommendation on “unifying strategic intelligence”\nand moving from the “need to know” to the “need to share.”\n\nIf there is an initial question for the incoming Biden-Harris Administration and America’s\nallies, it is this: Is the sharing of cybersecurity threat intelligence today better or worse than it\nwas for terrorist threats before 9/11?\n\nIn the wake of this most recent attack, perhaps no company has done more work than\nMicrosoft to support agencies across the federal government. As much as we appreciate the\ncommitment and professionalism of so many dedicated public servants, it is apparent to us\nthat the current state of information-sharing across the government is far from where it needs\nto be. It too often seems that federal agencies currently fail to act in a coordinated way or in\naccordance with a clearly defined national cybersecurity strategy. While parts of the federal\ngovernment have been quick to seek input, information sharing with first responders in a\nposition to act has been limited. During a cyber incident of national significance, we need to\ndo more to prioritize the information-sharing and collaboration needed for swift and effective\naction. In many respects, we risk as a nation losing sight of some of the most important\nlessons identified by the 9/11 Commission.\n\nOne indicator of the current situation is reflected in the federal government’s insistence on\nrestricting through its contracts our ability to let even one part of the federal government\nknow what other part has been attacked. Instead of encouraging a “need to share,” this turns\ninformation sharing into a breach of contract. It literally has turned the 9/11 Commission’s\nrecommendations upside down.\n\nIt will be critical for the incoming Biden-Harris Administration to move quickly and decisively\nto address this situation. One ready-made opportunity is to establish a national cybersecurity\n[director as recommended by the Solarium Commission and provided for in the National](https://www.solarium.gov/)\nDefense Authorization Act.\n\n\n-----\n\nEffective progress will also require a second realization that goes beyond anything the 9/11\nCommission needed to confront. Cybersecurity threat intelligence exists in even more\ndisconnected silos than more traditional information about national security threats. This is\nbecause it is spread not only among different agencies and governments but across multiple\nprivate sector companies as well. Even within a large company like Microsoft, we have\nlearned that it is critical for our Threat Intelligence Center to aggregate and analyze data\nfrom across our data centers and services. And when there is a major threat, we need to\nshare information and collective assessments with other tech companies.\n\nRecent years have brought several important steps to better share cybersecurity information,\nand we greatly appreciate the dedication and support of many key people across the U.S.\ngovernment. But we still lack a formal and cohesive national strategy for the sharing of\ncybersecurity threat intelligence between the public and private sectors. While there need to\nbe important safeguards to protect government secrets and private citizens’ privacy, the time\nhas come for a more systemic and innovative approach to the sharing and analysis of threat\nintelligence with those best positioned to act.\n\n**_Second, we need to strengthen international rules to put reckless nation-state_**\n**behavior out of bounds and ensure that domestic laws thwart the rise of the**\n**cyberattack ecosystem. While the world has important international norms and laws to**\naddress nation-state attacks, we continue to believe it is important to fill in gaps and continue\nto develop clear and binding legal obligations for cyberspace.\n\nThis should build on the lessons of 2020 and prioritize key and specific areas. For example,\nit should include the continued development of rules to expressly forbid the type of broad and\nreckless activity used against SolarWinds and its customers, which tampered with legitimate\nsoftware and threatened the stability of a broader software supply chain. The international\n[community has been moving in this direction, building on a 2015 report by a United Nations](https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/70/174)\n[Group of Governmental Experts that received broad UN endorsement last year, as well as](https://undocs.org/A/RES/74/28)\n[multi-stakeholder support by the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace (GCSC).](https://cyberstability.org/norms/#toggle-id-3)\nThe U.S. government and its allies need to make crystal clear their views that this type of\nsupply chain attack falls outside the bounds of international law.\n\nWe need similar strong and effective endorsements of rules that put attacks on health care\n[institutions and vaccine providers off limits. (The recently convened Oxford Process has](https://www.elac.ox.ac.uk/the-oxford-statement-on-the-international-law-protections-against-cyber-operations-targeting-the-hea)\ndone important work to highlight the protections existing international law affords in this\ncontext.) And international rules should include stronger protections of democratic and\nelectoral processes, as reflected in the principles of the Paris Call for Trust and Security in\nCyberspace, which now has more than 1,000 signatories – the largest multi-stakeholder\ngroup ever assembled in support of an international cybersecurity-focused agreement.\n\nIn addition, governments should take new and concerted steps to thwart the rise of private\nsector offensive actors. As described above, these companies in effect have created a new\necosystem to support offensive nation-state attacks. The sooner governments take action to\n\n\n-----\n\nput this ecosystem out of business, the better.\n\nAn early opportunity for the Biden-Harris Administration will come in an appellate judicial\ncase involving the NSO Group itself. NSO has appealed a lower court finding that it is not\nimmune from claims that it violated the U.S. Computer Fraud and Abuse Act by accessing\nmobile devices without permission. Its argument is that it is immune from U.S. law because it\nis acting on behalf of a foreign government customer and hence shares that government’s\nlegal immunity. NSO’s proposed recipe would make a bad problem even worse, which is why\nMicrosoft is joining with other companies in opposing this interpretation. The Biden/Harris\nAdministration should weigh in with a similar view.\n\nNSO’s legal approach, while disconcerting, does the world a service by highlighting the path\nneeded to thwart this new cyberattack ecosystem. It’s to ensure that domestic laws clearly\nand strongly prohibit companies from helping governments engage in unlawful and offensive\ncyberattacks and investors from knowingly financing them.\n\nConsider the analogy to other forms of societally harmful activity, like human trafficking,\nnarcotics or terrorism itself. Governments not only take strong steps to prohibit the illegal\nactivity itself – such as engaging in drug trafficking – but also ensure that airlines don’t\ntransport the drugs and investors don’t finance the activity.\n\nA similar approach is needed to deter private sector offensive actors. We need steps to\nensure, for example, that American and other investors don’t knowingly fuel the growth of\nthis type of illegal activity. And the United States should proactively pursue discussions with\nother countries that are giving rise to these companies, including Israel, which has a strong\ncybersecurity ecosystem that can be drawn into dangerous support of authoritarian regimes.\n\n**_Finally, we need stronger steps to hold nation-states accountable for cyberattacks._**\nGovernments and private companies have taken stronger steps in recent years to hold\nnation-states publicly accountable for cyberattacks. We need to build on this course and\ncontinue to press forward with it, with governments ensuring that there are greater real-world\nconsequences for these attacks to promote stability and discourage conflict.\n\nThe world’s democracies took important steps in 2017 and 2018, led by the United States.\nWith public statements about WannaCry and NotPetya, multiple governments attributed\nthese attacks publicly to the North Korean and Russian governments, respectively. These\ntypes of coordinated public attributions have become an important tool to respond to nationstate attacks. The United States followed with stronger deterrent steps to protect the 2018\nmid-term elections, and an even more concerted effort to successfully deter foreign\ntampering with voting in the 2020 Presidential elections.\n\nIn the private sector, circumstances have also changed dramatically since the early days in\n2016 when we at Microsoft took legal action to thwart Russian cyberattacks on American\npolitical campaigns but were reluctant to speak publicly about it. In the years since,\n\n\n-----\n\ncompanies such as Microsoft, Google, Facebook and Twitter have all acted and spoken\ndirectly and publicly when responding to nation-state cyberattacks. Moreover, a coalition of\nmore than 145 global technology companies have signed on to the Cybersecurity Tech\nAccord – committing themselves to upholding four principles of responsible behavior to\npromote peace and security online, including opposing cyberattacks against innocent\ncivilians and enterprises.\n\nThe coming months will present a critical test, not only for the United States but for other\nleading democracies and technology companies. The weeks ahead will provide mounting\nand we believe indisputable evidence about the source of these recent attacks. It will\nbecome even clearer that they reflect not just the latest technology applied to traditional\nespionage, but a reckless and broad endangerment of the digital supply chain and our most\nimportant economic, civic and political institutions. It is the type of international assault that\nrequires the type of collective response that shows that serious violations have\nconsequences.\n\nIf there is a common lesson from the past few years, it’s the importance of combining\nongoing learning with new innovations, greater collaboration, and constant courage. For four\ncenturies, the people of the world have relied on governments to protect them from foreign\nthreats. But digital technology has created a world where governments cannot take effective\naction alone. The defense of democracy requires that governments and technology\ncompanies work together in new and important ways – to share information, strengthen\ndefenses and respond to attacks. As we put 2020 behind us, the new year provides a new\nopportunity to move forward on all these fronts.\n\n**Editor’s note: 12/17/2020, 7:50pm PT**\n\nFollowing news reports about the impact on Microsoft of the SolarWinds issue, the company\nissued the following statement:\n\n_“Like other SolarWinds customers, we have been actively looking for indicators of this actor_\n_and can confirm that we detected malicious SolarWinds binaries in our environment, which_\n_we isolated and removed.
