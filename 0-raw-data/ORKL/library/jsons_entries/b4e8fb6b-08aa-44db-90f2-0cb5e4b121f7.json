Affiliates are provided access to a control panel\nhosted on the Tor network as an onion site, where they can generate new malware builds\nand review data collected from infected hosts.\n\nRaccoon Stealer has been marketed as a service in the underground economy since at least\nApril 2019.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 1 – Raccoon Stealer Advertisement**\n\nRaccoon Stealer has the capability to steal the following data from infected systems:\n\nSaved passwords\nCredit card information\nCryptocurrency wallets\nBrowser data (cookies, saved forms, etc.)\n\n**In this blog we will examine Raccoon Stealer’s initial command and control (C2)**\n**infrastructure and assess the scale of the threat based on recent victim data.**\n\n## Raccoon Stealer C2 Infrastructure\n\nRaccoon Stealer advertisements refer to its back-end infrastructure as ‘the heart’ of the\nproject. The following points are emphasised as strengths over its competitors:\n\nAutomated deployment of new ‘gates’ to minimise downtime.\nExisting builds still function after new ‘gates’ are deployed.\nControl panel hosted on the Tor network as an onion site.\n\nIn this context, a gate is a reverse proxy that forwards traffic from victims to upstream C2\ninfrastructure.\n\nAt the time of execution, Raccoon Stealer samples retrieve the URL of the active gate from a\nTelegram channel that is unique to the affiliate. The URL is stored in an encrypted string\nlocated in the public description of the Telegram channel.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 2 – An Example of an Affiliate Telegram Channel**\n\nA Telegram channel is created for each Raccoon Stealer affiliate, with the currently active\n_gate information supplied as an encrypted string in the public channel description. When a_\nnew gate is deployed, the public channel description for all affiliates’ Telegram channels are\nautomatically updated to point to the new gate.\n\nFurther insight into the Raccoon Stealer infection chain is detailed in Avast’s recent [blog on](https://decoded.avast.io/vladimirmartyanov/raccoon-stealer-trash-panda-abuses-telegram/)\nthe same topic.\n\n## Tracking Gates\n\nSince July 2021 (a period of approximately 250 days), we have observed a total of 135\ndistinct gates, indicating an average ‘up time’ of less than two days. However, this average is\nimpacted by a small number of longstanding gates – particularly around the Christmas / New\nYear period in 2021/22. Over 25% of the gates were active for less than 12 hours.\n\nOne key observation we were able to make is that regardless of the number of affiliates or\nTelegram channels in operation, Raccoon Stealer only ever uses a single gate IP address at\nany one time, which is consistent across all affiliate operations.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 3 – A Summary of Raccoon Stealer ‘Gates’**\n\nAs can be seen, based on the legend in Figure 3, several hosting providers are utilised by\nthe Raccoon Stealer operators. Since July 2021, a total of 17 distinct providers were\nobserved, nearly half on just one occasion, with MIVOCLOUD (47), SERVERASTRA-AS\n(26), PQ-HOSTING-AS (21) and GOOGLE (18) being the most frequently occurring\nproviders.\n\n**Overall, it is clear the operators of Raccoon Stealer have deployed a dynamic**\n**approach to limit the impact of cyber defence techniques (e.g., the active blocking of**\n**IPs) on their service. Although we would note that beyond the initial gates the**\n**infrastructure remains broadly static.**\n\n## Victimology\n\n[Previous research published by Cybereason in October 2019 assessed that Raccoon Stealer](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/hunting-raccoon-stealer-the-new-masked-bandit-on-the-block)\nhad, at the time, already infected over 100,000 endpoints. In this victimology we seek to\nprovide an updated indication as to the global impact of Raccoon Stealer today.\n\nAs previously referenced, during December 2021 and January 2022, several gate IP\naddresses remained static for multiple days. This afforded us the opportunity to examine a\nlarger victim data sample than is usually available for any one particular gate IP address.\n\nWe will focus on two such gates which were active for 21-days combined.\n\nWhen examining network telemetry for these gates, a total of ~95,000 distinct IP addresses\nwere observed connecting over TCP/80 (the port used for initial victim connections to the\n_gate)._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Attempts were made to filter out unlikely victims, for example by omitting connections from_\n_large hosting providers, or from IP addresses identified as proxies or anonymisation_\n_services. Caveats must also be made for occurrences involving dynamically assigned IPs or_\n_scanning activity._\n\n**Figure 4 – Potential Raccoon Stealer Victims**\n\nFigure 4 provides an illustration of WHOIS information for the ~95,000 IP addresses\nbeaconing to the Raccoon Stealer gates. This data indicated significant concentrations in\nBrazil, India, Indonesia, and the United States, as well as clusters in Southeast Asia,\nNorthern Africa and Europe.\n\nAs has been covered by other commentators on this threat activity, we also note an absence\nof potential victims in Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries – which remains\nconsistent with the Raccoon Stealer advertising (‘NO CIS EVER!’).\n\nOur assessment of the Raccoon Stealer operators is ‘likely Russian-speaking, but not\nnecessarily Russian-based’. A future blog will explore our understanding of the management\nof Raccoon Stealer.\n\n**In conclusion, based on Team Cymru’s snapshot of global internet activity, Raccoon**\n**Stealer continues to ‘create’ thousands of new victims per week from countries**\n**around the world.**\n\n\n-----",
