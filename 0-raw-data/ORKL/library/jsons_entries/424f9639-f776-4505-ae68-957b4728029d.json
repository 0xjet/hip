This computer](https://decoded.avast.io/danielbenes/crackonosh-a-new-malware-distributed-in-cracked-software/)\nvirus spreads through cracked software, specifically through illicit video game copies. The\nmalware’s main purpose is Monero crypto mining, which is quite a conspicuous activity that\nshould be detected by security products. With that in mind, the malware’s authors have\nincorporated multiple evasion techniques into the malware. Despite its blatant behavior,\nCrackonosh has not received much cover from security vendors, and its developers have\nmanaged to mine approximately 2 million dollars’ worth of cryptocurrency.\n\nAs described by Avast, upon installation the malware disables security products such as\nWindows Defender. It will even replace Defender’s executable with a custom binary that will\nplace the Windows security icon inside the system tray. Another method the malware uses to\nevade detection is a registry key check for VMware and VirtualBox keys. This is done in\nmultiple stages of the attack, to avoid execution of each of the malicious payloads inside a\nsandbox. Finally, the actual crypto-jacking binary will verify that no analysis process resides\nin memory and will not execute if one is found.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen searching for IOCs of this threat in our telemetry, we found an infection that was\n[thwarted by our product in March of this year. After examining the files involved in this](https://minerva-labs.com/products/minervas-incident-response)\nbreach, we can confirm they are indeed a part of this highly profitable operation. We even\nfound a version of the file winscomrssrv.dll that was not present in the IOC section of the\noriginal Avast article, but contained the exact same functionality as the binary described\nthere.\n\nCrackonosh’s main agenda is evasiveness and that is why it has successfully stayed hidden\nsince 2018. For the cyber security industry to tackle these events in real time, a change in\nparadigm is needed. Moving the pressure into the malware developer’s territory is exactly\nwhat Minerva Labs Hostile Environment Simulation does. By simulating a sandbox\nenvironment for each process on the system we prevent live infections from detonating in\ncorporate endpoints.\n\nCrackonosh’s miner prevented:\n\nwinscomrssrv.dll querying for VMware registry keys, which are simulated by Minerva:\n\n**IOCs:**\n\ncbdd93ba08e87007665250c3253a1fe9ad38511e4a8a2e5305adc0f36e43ab44\n(winscomrssrv.dll)\n\n8f8c635949fd4a315dc7c2d30fc9a6a18149621e72b9598abf50d54a4bf116ac\n\n(StartupCheckLibrary.dll)\n\n\n-----\n\n91bfb82ed5c32979368eddcd34861b631926d2352d16adf189944c4ba8ccf4e1\n\n(winlogui.exe)\n\n5b85ceb558baaded794e4db8b8279e2ac42405896b143a63f8a334e6c6bba3fb\n(winrmsrv.exe)\n\n[« Previous Post](https://blog.minerva-labs.com/please-note-the-kesaya-attack-was-preventable-with-minerva-technology?hsLang=en-us)\n[Next Post](https://blog.minerva-labs.com/taurus-user-guided-infection?hsLang=en-us) »\n\n### Interested in Minerva?
