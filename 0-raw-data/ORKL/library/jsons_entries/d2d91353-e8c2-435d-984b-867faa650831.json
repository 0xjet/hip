    "plain_text": "# Have Your Cake and Eat it Too? An Overview of UNC2891\n\n**mandiant.com/resources/unc2891-overview**\n\n[The Mandiant Advanced Practices team previously published a threat research blog post that provided an overview of UNC1945 operations](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/live-off-the-land-an-overview-of-unc1945)\nwhere the actor compromised managed services providers to gain access to targets in the financial and professional consulting industries.\n\nSince that time, Mandiant has investigated and attributed several intrusions to a threat cluster we believe has a nexus to this actor, currently\nbeing tracked as UNC2891. Through these investigations, Mandiant has discovered additional techniques, malware, and utilities being used by\nUNC2891 alongside those previously observed in use by UNC1945. Despite having identified significant overlaps between these threat\nclusters, Mandiant has not determined they are attributable to the same actor.\n\nUNC2891 intrusions appear to be financially motivated and in some cases spanned several years through which the actor had remained\nlargely undetected.\nUNC2891 demonstrated fluency and expertise in Unix and Linux environments, mostly through the targeting of Oracle Solaris based\nsystems with TINYSHELL and SLAPSTICK backdoors.\nMandiant observed UNC2891 operate with a high degree of OPSEC and leverage both public and private malware, utilities, and scripts\nto remove evidence and hinder response efforts.\nMandiant discovered a previously unknown rootkit for Oracle Solaris systems that UNC2891 used to remain hidden in victim networks,\nwe have named this CAKETAP.\nOne Variant of CAKETAP manipulated messages transiting a victims Automatic Teller Machine (ATM) switching network. It is believed\nthis was leveraged as part of a larger operation to perform unauthorized cash withdrawals at several banks using fraudulent bank cards.\n\n## Extensive Use of SLAPSTICK and TINYSHELL Backdoors\n\nLike past UNC1945 intrusions, Mandiant observed UNC2891 make extensive use of the Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM) based\nbackdoor we track as SLAPSTICK to aid with credential harvesting, and to provide backdoor access to compromised machines in victim\n[networks. As detailed in our previous blog post, SLAPSTICK provides persistent backdoor access to infected systems with a hard-coded](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/live-off-the-land-an-overview-of-unc1945)\n_magical password, it also logs authentication attempts and corresponding passwords in an encrypted log file. Although this is expected to have_\ntremendously assisted UNC2891 with credential harvesting and lateral movement activities, it also provided valuable information to Mandiant\nIncident Responders. Although SLAPSTICK log files were often timestomped, Mandiant was able to decode them and trace some of the\nactor’s lateral movement activities through the usage of the backdoor provided magical password.\n\nFigure 1: Example SLAPSTICK decoded log\n\n(fabricated)\n\n\n-----\n\no gs de S S C, U C 89 o te sta ed a custo [a a t o t e pub c y a a ab e](https://github.com/creaktive/tsh) S bac doo U C 89 S\nbackdoors leveraged an external encrypted configuration file and some variants included additional functionality, such as the ability to\ncommunicate via a HTTP proxy with basic authentication. In line with the group’s familiarity with Unix and Linux based systems, UNC2891\noften named and configured their TINYSHELL backdoors with values that masqueraded as legitimate services that might be overlooked by\ninvestigators, such as systemd (SYSTEMD), name service cache daemon (NCSD), and the Linux at daemon (ATD).\n\nTable 1: Observed TINYSHELL file paths\n\nTINYSHELL Backdoor File Paths TINYSHELL Configuration File Paths\n\n\n/usr/lib/libhelpx.so.1\n\n/usr/lib/systemd/systemd-helper\n\n/usr/sbin/nscd\n\n\n/usr/lib/libatdcf.so\n\n/usr/lib/libnscd.so.1\n\n/usr/lib/libsystemdcf.so\n\n/var/ntp/ntpstats/1\n\n\nTable 2: Example decoded TINYSHELL configuration (systemd variant)\n\nExample Decoded configuration\n\npm_systemd_mag <32-character string>\n\nsystemd_nme <system id>\n\npm_systemd_adr <C2 IP address/domain>\n\npm_systemd_prt <443 or 53>\n\npm_systemd_tme 300\n\nsystemd_non1 none\n\nsystemd_non2 none\n\nsystemd_non3 none\n\nsystemd_non4 none\n\nIn the case of the systemd variant, UNC2891 also leveraged systemd service unit files for persistence of the TINYSHELL backdoor.\n\nTable 3: Service unit file used for TINYSHELL persistence\n\n/usr/lib/systemd/system/systemd-helper.service\n\n[Unit]\n\nDescription=Rebuild Hardware Database\n\n[Service]\n\nType=forking\n\nExecStart=/lib/systemd/systemd-helper\n\n[Install]\n\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n\nBased on analyzed configurations, UNC2891 had configured TINYSHELL backdoors in a multi-hop structure that leveraged several\ncompromised internal servers for command and control. In one case, Mandiant found evidence that suggests the actor had chained different\nTINYSHELL variants together to obtain remote access to a server inside a network segment with network restrictions.\n\nTo keep their network of TINYSHELL connections hidden, UNC2891 had installed and configured a rootkit to filter out these connections from\nnetwork connection related APIs (keep reading for details on the CAKETAP rootkit). UNC2891 configured remotely accessible systems with\nTINYSHELL backdoors that used dynamic DNS domains for their external command and control channel. These domains were created perhost and were not used more than once, the subdomains sometimes resembled the hostname of the compromised machine. Mandiant was\nunable to collect passive DNS data for these dynamic DNS domains, suggesting that UNC2891 had likely enabled IP resolution for short\n\n\n-----\n\npe ods o t e e access to t e et o as equ ed t o e ct, t ese S bac doo s e e co gu ed to pe o\ncommunications using TCP over port 53 and 443, likely as a mechanism to bypass outbound network protections, blend in with existing traffic,\nand evade detection.\n\nFigure 2: Example of TINYSHELL command and\n\ncontrol used by UNC2891\n\n## STEELHOUND, STEELCORGI and Environment Variable Keying\n\nUNC2891 often made use of the STEELCORGI in-memory dropper which decrypts its embedded payloads by deriving a ChaCha20 key from\nthe value of an environment variable obtained at runtime. In many cases, Mandiant was unable to recover the requisite environment variables\nto decrypt the embedded payloads. However, in the limited samples we were able to decrypt, UNC2891 had deployed different versions of an\nextensive toolkit which appears to be developed under the name SUN4ME. SUN4ME contains tools for network reconnaissance, host\n[enumeration, exploitation of known vulnerabilities, log wiping, file operations, as well as common shell utilities. Yoroi has previously published](https://yoroi.company/research/opening-steelcorgi-a-sophisticated-apt-swiss-army-knife/)\n[information about this toolkit following our previous blog post on UNC1945’s usage of STEELCORGI.](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/live-off-the-land-an-overview-of-unc1945)\n\nMandiant discovered UNC2891 leveraging a similar in-memory dropper that also used environment variables to decrypt its embedded payload\nbut instead relied on RC4 encryption, we have named this STEELHOUND. In addition to functioning as dropper for an embedded payload,\nSTEELHOUND is also able to encrypt new payloads by encrypting a target binary and writing it to disk along with a copy of itself and an endof-file configuration.\n\n## WINGHOOK and WINGCRACK\n\nDuring these investigations, Mandiant also discovered a family of keylogger malware we have named WINGHOOK and WINGCRACK.\n\nWINGHOOK is a keylogger for Linux and Unix based operating systems. It is packaged as a shared library (SO file) that hooks the read\nand fgets functions, which are two common functions used for processing user input. The captured data is stored in an encoded format in\nthe directory /var/tmp/ with a filename that begins with .zmanDw.\nWINGCRACK is a utility that can decode and display the content of files containing encoded keylog data from WINGHOOK. The malware\nauthor appears to refer to these encoded files as “schwing” files.\n\n## Utilities Observed\n\nMandiant previously observed UNC1945 use a large amount of different public and private tools during their intrusions, and this was also true\nfor UNC2891. Mandiant discovered additional utilities that were leveraged by UNC2891:\n\nBINBASH is a simple ELF utility that executes a shell after setting the group ID and user ID to either \"root\" or specified values. BINBASH\n[appears to be a compilation of the source code.](https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/23336/Slx2k001.txt.html)\n\n\n-----\n\nG s a ut ty t at c ea s spec c og e t es o u a d U based syste s t ca e o e e t es assoc ated t a\n[given user in the lastlog, utmp/utmpx, wtmp/wtmpx, and pacct logs. It appears to have originated from available source code, and](http://www.afn.org/~afn28925/wipe.c)\n[possibly a more recent version.](https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/23336/Slx2k001.txt.html)\nMIGLOGCLEANER is another ELF utility that wipes logs or remove certain strings from logs on Linux and Unix based systems. It is\n[publicly available on GitHub.](https://github.com/Kabot/mig-logcleaner-resurrected)\n\nWhilst seemingly uncommon amongst threat actors, UNC2891 frequently used the uuencoding scheme to encode and decode files, such as\nmalware binaries or files containing output from extensive host enumeration scripts. The actor often leveraged simple Perl wrapper scripts that\nperformed uuencoding and uudecoding functions.\n\n## CAKETAP\n\nCAKETAP is a kernel module rootkit that UNC2891 deployed on key server infrastructure running Oracle Solaris. CAKETAP can hide network\nconnections, processes, and files. During initialization, it removes itself from the loaded modules list and updates the last_module_id with the\npreviously loaded module to hide its presence.\n\nA hook is installed into the function ipcl_get_next_conn, as well as several functions in the ip module. This enables CAKETAP to filter out any\nconnections that match an actor-configured IP address or port (local or remote).\n\nOne way to identify CAKETAP running on a Solaris system is to check for the presence of this hook. The following shows an example\ncommand to identify a hooked ipcl_get_next_conn function (Note: The mdb command may require special permissions on the system):\n\nroot@solaris:~# echo 'ipcl_get_next_conn::dis -n 0 ; ::quit' | mdb -k\n\nThe output in a clean SPARC Solaris system would look similar to the following:\n\nipcl_get_next_conn: save %sp, -0xb0, %sp\n\nA hooked function would begin with the sethi instruction as follows (the constant 0x11971c00 will change from instance to instance depending\non where CAKETAP is loaded):\n\nipcl_get_next_conn: sethi %hi(0x11971c00), %g1\n\nAdditional hooks are installed into the mkdirat (make directory at) and getdents64 (get directory entries) system calls. CAKETAP uses the\n_mkdirat hook to receive commands from paths containing the signal string. Commands include configuring network filters, display or update its_\nconfiguration, and to unhide itself. The getdents64 hook enables CAKETAP to hide files or directories on the file system containing the secret\nsignal string. Table 4 contains the signal strings for the CAKETAP hooks.\n\nTable 4: Observed secrets for CAKETAP hooks\n\nSecret Usage\n\n.caahGss187 mkdirat hook signal string\n\n.zaahGss187 getdents64 hook signal string\n\nThe mkdirat hook enabled UNC2891 to control and configure CAKETAP through existing backdoor access to compromised servers by issuing\nshell commands that leverage these system calls (e.g. mkdir for mkdirat). A single character appended to the signal string indicated which\ncommand was to be executed. The following commands were observed:\n\nTable 5: Observed CAKETAP commands\n\nCommand Function\n\nEmpty Add the CAKETAP module back to loaded modules list\n\nM Change the signal string for the getdents64 hook\n\nI Add a network filter (format <IP>p<PORT>)\n\n\n-----\n\ni Remove a network filter\n\nP Set the current thread TTY to not be filtered by the getdents64 hook\n\np Set all TTYs to be filtered by the getdents64 hook\n\nS Displays the current configuration\n\nFor example, to configure a new network filter and display the current configuration, the following commands might be used:\n\n_mkdir /some/path/.caahGss187I192.168.1.10p80 - Add network filter for 192.168.1.10:80_\n_mkdir /some/path/.caahGss187S - Display current configuration_\n\nThe hook installed into getdents64 filtered output to hide presence of the signal string in directory contents.\n\nMandiant observed UNC2891 load CAKETAP with the module name ipstat from attacker created directories that often resided somewhere\ninside the /var directory tree.\n\n## CAKETAP Unauthorized Transactions\n\nMemory forensics from one victim’s ATM switch server revealed a variant of CAKETAP with additional network hooking functionality that\nintercepted specific messages relating to card and pin verification. Evidence suggests that this variant of CAKETAP was used as part of an\noperation to perform unauthorized transactions using fraudulent bank cards.\n\nThis CAKETAP variant targeted specific messages destined for the Payment Hardware Security Module (HSM). This additional network\nhooking performed several functions:\n\n1. Manipulation of card verification messages:\n\nCAKETAP altered the mode of certain outgoing messages to disable card verification. This resulted in the HSM not performing the proper\ncard verification and instead generating a valid response. Fraudulent bank cards generated verification messages using a custom\nalgorithm using the Primary Account Number (PAN) and other parameters which served as a “marker” for CAKETAP. CAKETAP\nexamined outgoing messages and if it matched the algorithm, CAKETAP identified the card as fraudulent and stored the PAN in memory\nto use in the following step.\n2. Replay of PIN verification messages:\n\nCAKETAP examined outgoing PIN verification messages that matched certain conditions and identified those with a Primary Account\nNumber (PAN) that reflected a fraudulent card. If the message was not for a fraudulent card, it would save the message internally and\nsend it unmodified, as to not interrupt legitimate ATM PIN verifications. However, if it was for a fraudulent card, CAKETAP would instead\nreplace the message content with data from a previously saved message. This was effectively a replay attack that resulted in a bypass of\nPIN verification for fraudulent cards.\n\nBased on Mandiant’s investigation findings, we believe that CAKETAP was leveraged by UNC2891 as part of a larger operation to successfully\nuse fraudulent bank cards to perform unauthorized cash withdrawals from ATM terminals at several banks.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nUNC2891 maintains a high level of OPSEC and employs several techniques to evade detection. The actor uses their skill and experience to\ntake full advantage of the decreased visibility and security measures that are often present in Unix and Linux environments. Mandiant expects\nthat UNC2891 will continue to capitalize on this and perform similar operations for financial gain that target mission critical systems running\nthese operating systems.\n\nWhile some of the overlaps between UNC2891 and UNC1945 are notable, it is not conclusive enough to attribute the intrusions to a single\nthreat group. For example, it is possible that significant portions of UNC2891 and UNC1945 activity are carried out by an entity that is a\ncommon resource to multiple threat actors, which could explain the perceived difference in intrusion objectives—a common malware developer\nor an intrusion partner, for example. Regardless, Mandiant is releasing this information on the actor to raise awareness of the fraudulent\nactivity and aid defenders in uncovering further UNC2891 operations.\n\n## YARA\n\nThe following YARA rules are not intended to be used on production systems or to inform blocking rules without first being validated through an\norganization's own internal testing processes to ensure appropriate performance and limit the risk of false positives. These rules are intended\nto serve as a starting point for hunting efforts to identify samples, however, they may need adjustment over time if the malware family changes.\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nrule TINYSHELL\n{\n\n```\n```\n  meta:\n    author = \"Mandiant \"\n\n```\n```\n  strings:\n    $sb1 = { C6 00 48 C6 4?
