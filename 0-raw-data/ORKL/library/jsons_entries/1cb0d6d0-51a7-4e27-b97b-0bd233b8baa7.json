As discussed in the first part of this blog series [1], these detection insights](https://labs.f-secure.com/blog/catching-lazarus-threat-intelligence-to-real-detection-logic/)\n[are derived from intelligence contained in a recent report[2] released by the F-Secure Threat](https://labs.f-secure.com/publications/ti-report-lazarus-group-cryptocurrency-vertical/)\nIntelligence (TI) Team. From the TI report, we know that the Lazarus Group employed\n[varying techniques across the MITRE ATT&CK® Matrix[3] in their attack. We covered three](https://attack.mitre.org/)\nphases in the first blog post: Initial Access, Execution, and Persistence, and we discussed\npart of the Defense Evasion phase.\n\nThe remaining techniques in the defense evasion phase will be covered in this blog post, as\nwell as the Credential Access, Lateral Movement and Command & Control phases. The\nactions performed within these later phases allow threat actors to establish a greater foothold\non the target organization’s network, and are therefore critically important for defenders to\ndetect.\n\nThe Sigma rules created for the techniques discussed in this blog post, are marked in bold in\n[the table below and are provided in the F-Secure Countercept GitHub repository[4]. Existing](https://github.com/countercept/lazarus-sigma-rules)\nSigma rules are also listed below, as some techniques were already covered.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Defense Evasion\n\n### T1055.002 – Process Injection: Portable Executable (PE) Injection\n\n\n-----\n\nSome of the malware from the Lazarus Group s campaign had the capability to perform\nPortable Executable (PE) injection to load additional payloads. For example, the\n“NTUSER.cat” binary had the capability to load encrypted PE files from disk into its own\nprocess memory, decrypt the PE file, and then inject them into another process, namely\nExplorer.exe.\n\nThis is a common technique to evade traditional defenses (such as anti-virus software) and\nfocuses on the inspection of artefacts written to disk, as the malicious content is only\ndecrypted in memory and does not exist on disk in plaintext. Furthermore, injecting malicious\ncontent into a separate legitimate process allows subsequent malicious activities\nto masquerade as the normal behavior of the legitimate process. F-Secure has published a\n[separate blogpost[5] that explains the different types of process injection in detail.](https://blog.f-secure.com/memory-injection-like-a-boss/)\n\n**Detection**\n\nIt is difficult to detect process injection with rules that look for process anomalies. For\nexample, it could be perfectly normal for Explorer.exe to launch Cmd.exe to perform\nadministrative tasks. In the case where malicious code is injected into Explorer.exe to launch\na Cmd shell for further commands, process creation logs would also show Explorer.exe\nlaunching Cmd.exe.\n\nAt F-Secure Countercept, we make use of advanced memory scanning techniques to detect\ninstances of process injection. This involves inspecting process memory in real-time and\nlooking for anomalies which are indicators of process injection. For example, a basic\nscanning technique could look for process memory regions which are executable but are not\nof the type MEM_IMAGE. This would indicate that the process memory region is not “backed\nby disk” and could be an artifact of process injection. This example is just the tip of the\niceberg and there are many other complex memory anomalies that can be examined to\nidentify suspicious memory regions.\n\nAlthough in-memory detection is often tackled through anti-virus or EDR software, blue\nteams can still leverage open source capabilities to alert on potential process injection. For\nexample, SpecterOps has published an excellent write-up on the procedures of crafting the\n[detection logic for a specific type of process injection known as process hollowing [6]. In the](https://posts.specterops.io/engineering-process-injection-detections-part-1-research-951e96ad3c85)\nthree-part blogpost, it was determined that neither process creation nor process access logs\ncan be used on their own to identify process hollowing due to the significant number of false\npositives. Instead, a hunt query using Jupyter Notebooks was more appropriate in dealing\nwith the complexities of process injection detection, where different types of process logs\nwere correlated to filter for a sequence of events consistent with process hollowing. There\n[are also several open-source tools – such as ‘hollows_hunter’[7] - which can provide blue](https://github.com/hasherezade/hollows_hunter)\nteams with the ability to scan endpoints for suspicious memory regions.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition to detecting process injection, another powerful threat hunting technique is to look\nfor the execution of rare executables and binaries with uncommon extensions. In the case of\nthe Lazarus Group, the binary with the “.CAT” extension was used to read the configuration\nfile with the “.SDB” extension, and then to inject the referenced files into another process. A\nhunt query looking for rare executables would often catch this kind of behavior.\n\n### T1070.001 – Indicator Removal on Host: Clear Windows Event Logs\n\nTo decrease the chances of being detected, the Lazarus Group removed evidence of their\nactivity as they moved within the victim network. For instance, they were observed using the\nWevtutil tool to export Windows security event logs:\n\ncmd.exe /c \"wevtutil epl security \"/q:*[System[(EventID=4778 or EventID=4624)]]\"\nc:\\users\\public\\evt2.dat >C:\\Windows\\TEMP\\TMP1AC9.tmp 2>&1\"\n\nIn the command snippet shown above, we can see that the Lazarus Group exported copies\nof two Event IDs with the Wevtutil tool. These Event IDs, 4778 and 4624, respectively log\nevents showing when a user reconnects to a disconnected terminal (meaning that user\npreviously had logged in to that terminal), and when a user successfully logs into a machine.\n\nSubsequently, all 4778 and 4624 events pertaining to the compromised user accounts were\nremoved and could not be found during the investigation of the Windows Event Logs. This\nmade it challenging to piece together the movement of the attacker during the incident\nresponse investigation.\n\n**Detection**\n\nAlthough the specific technique used to clear the event logs was not identified in the TI\nreport, blue teams can still build detection logic for known techniques. As the Lazarus group\nused the Wevtutil tool to export Event Logs we can first focus on how this tool can be utilized\nto clear event logs:\n\nwevtutil cl <Logname>\n\n[There are two existing Sigma rules[8][9] to detect Windows Event Logs being cleared. Both](https://github.com/Neo23x0/sigma/blob/master/rules/windows/process_creation/win_susp_eventlog_clear.yml)\nrules provide suitable detection coverage, but our testing showed that they generate a high\nnumber of false positives related to legitimate administrative activities. The number of false\npositives can be reduced if we focus specifically on the Security logs, also referred to as\n[Audit logs. Another Sigma rule[10] uses this approach, and looks for Event IDs 517 and 1102](https://github.com/Neo23x0/sigma/blob/master/rules/windows/builtin/win_susp_security_eventlog_cleared.yml)\n(both mean that the Audit log was cleared but on different Windows versions). This rule is\npowerful as it detects Security logs being cleared regardless of the command used by the\nattacker.\n\n\n-----\n\nHowever, none of the existing rules look for the Wevtutil tool being used to export Security\nlogs, as used by the Lazarus Group. We created a Sigma rule to detect both exporting and\nclearing of Security logs using the Wevtutil tool, so that defenders can get insight into this\nactivity happening on their estate. The command for clearing logs, “cl” (or “clear-log”), when\nit is focused on the Security logs, yields significantly fewer false positives based on historical\nendpoint data from F-Secure Countercept. The Sigma rule created to detect this behavior\ncan be found on our GitHub and is named win_wevtutil_clear_export_logs. The executable\n“MsSense.exe” is excluded as it is used for legitimate purposes to export the Security logs by\nWindows Defender Advanced Threat Protection.\n\nOur advice would be to implement all the above rules with different values for the “level” field\nbased on the false-positive rate. As the “level” corresponds to the severity for the rule, we\nwould recommend that rules that have a low false positive rate have a “critical” or “high”\nlevel, whereas rules that are more prone to false-positives should be “low” or “medium”.\n\nHowever, as pointed out at the beginning of this section, there are many other techniques\nthat a threat actor can use to clear Event Logs without using the Wevtutil tool. Furthermore,\nwhile we are only focusing on the clearing of Event Logs, an attacker could also disable log\n[generation or hide from Event Tracing for Windows (ETW)[10]. ETW is the kernel-level event](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/etw/about-event-tracing)\ntracing mechanism built into the Windows operating system that handles the logging of all\nsystem events. In fact, there are so many techniques that could be used to disable or hide\nfrom ETW that it could fit in a separate blog post series. As we are focusing on generating\ndetection from the Lazarus TI report, they fall outside the scope of this blog post.\n\nRegardless of whether the attacker clears the logs or disables ETW, this section underlines\nthe importance of streaming logs to a central source in real-time. With this implemented, if an\nattacker clears the logs on an endpoint – as the Lazarus Group did - it would only affect the\nlogs stored locally and therefore blue teams would not lose valuable forensic information.\nFurthermore, streaming logs to a central source provides the detection opportunity to alert\nwhen an endpoint stops sending logs while it is still online, this provides another “tripwire” for\ndetecting suspicious endpoint activity.\n\n### T1562.001 – Impair Defenses: Disable or Modify Tools\n\nDisabling Credential Guard\n\nThe Lazarus group were observed using a custom version of Mimikatz to harvest credentials\nfrom LSASS memory. To accomplish this, they first disabled Windows Defender Credential\nGuard.\n\nOlder versions of Windows used to store credentials in the memory of the Local Security\nAuthority (LSA) process. From Windows 10 onwards, credentials used by the operating\nsystem are stored in a new component called the isolated LSA, also known as the\n[“Credential Guard”.[11] This isolated LSA process (LSAIso.exe) is protected using](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/credential-guard/credential-guard-how-it-works)\n\n\n-----\n\nvirtualization-based security and is not accessible to the rest of the operating system except\nby the LSASS process through Remote Procedure Calls (RPC). Therefore, threat actors\noften disable this security mechanism before attempting to extract system credentials.\n\nBy modifying the registry entry shown below, the Lazarus Group disabled Credential Guard\nwhich caused LSA to store credentials in its process memory instead:\n\ncmd.exe /c reg add HKLM\\\\System\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\Control\\\\Lsa /v LsaCfgFlags /t\nREG_DWORD /d 0 /f 2>&1\n\nDetection\n\nAs the command above modifies the registry entry\n'HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\LSA\\LsaCfgFlags', the detection will be based on\nthe registry_event and process_creation log sources to be able to monitor any registry\nmodification.\n\nUsing the registry_event log source, we must filter for any event of \"SetValue\" or \"AddValue\"\nwith the value of 'DWORD (0x00000000)' in the above-mentioned registry entry. This log\nsource is important for detection as we can monitor any changes to this registry entry,\nregardless of the tool used by the attacker.\n\nThat said, if there is an issue with the registry event log (let’s say an attacker clears or\ntampers with logs, as previously mentioned), it is still good to have something for the process\ncreation logs. Here we could look for the Reg.exe command with the arguments ‘add\nHKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\LSA /v LsaCfgFlags /t REG_DWORD /d 0’.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis works well, but our telemetry showed that we can expand that detection rule by\nrestricting the command line arguments only to “LsaCfgFlags” and still have a very low false\npositive rate. This way it will also show an attacker deleting that registry entry (which also\ndisables CredentialGuard) or querying it (to check if CredentialGuard is enabled).\n\nBased on our telemetry, querying or modifying the Credential Guard registry value has a very\nlow false positive rate. The Sigma rule created to detect this behavior can be found on our\nGitHub and is named win_disable_credential_guard.\n\n## Credential Access\n\n### T1003.001 – OS Credential Dumping: LSASS Memory\n\nOnce Credential Guard has been disabled, it is significantly easier to extract credential\nmaterial from LSASS’ memory. The Lazarus group took advantage of that by performing the\nfollowing procedures:\n\nEnabling storage of credentials in plaintext (WDigest)\n\n[WDigest credential caching is a legacy authentication protocol.[12] This protocol causes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2003/cc778868(v%3dws.10))\nLSASS to store credentials in its memory in plain text and is enabled by default on Windows\n[Server versions prior to Server 2012 R2.[13] While it is disabled by default on more recent](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2014/06/05/an-overview-of-kb2871997/)\nversions of Windows, threat actors can modify the registry to enable WDigest credential\ncaching. The Lazarus Group were observed using the following command to achieve this:\n\ncmd.exe /c reg add HKLM\\\\System\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\Control\\\\SecurityProviders\\\\WDigest\n/v UseLogonCredential /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f 2>&1\n\nDetecting modification of WDigest plaintext credential caching registry entry\n\nThe detection for this technique is similar to the detection of Credential Guard being disabled\nas discussed earlier in this blog post. Any registry event or process creation log where the\nregistry entry\n'HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\SecurityProviders\\WDigest\\UseLogonCredential'\nhas its \"DWORD\" value modified to 1 is an indicator of this technique being used. While\n[there is an existing Sigma rule[14] which includes the detection for this behavior, it also](https://github.com/Neo23x0/sigma/blob/master/rules/windows/process_creation/win_apt_chafer_mar18.yml)\nincludes detections for other techniques specific to another APT group. As such, we have\nwritten a separate rule specifically detecting the modification of the WDigest credential\ncaching registry key. During our testing of this detection rule, we had almost no false\npositives except for a few instances caused by vulnerability management scripts. If this\ndetection rule causes too many false positives in your environment, you could modify the rule\nto only focus on the modification of the registry entry to the value ”1”. The Sigma rule created\nto detect this behavior can be found on our GitHub and is named win_reg_enable_wdigest.\n\nUsing standard Mimikatz functions to dump credentials\n\n\n-----\n\nWith the previous preparation steps completed; threat actors can then use tools like Mimikatz\nto harvest credentials from the LSASS process memory.\n\nWhile the Lazarus Group were observed using a custom or simply a renamed version of\nMimikatz, traces of the commonly used functions of Mimikatz could still be identified through\nthe command line arguments, such as “privilege” and “sekurlsa”:\n\ncmd.exe c:\\users\\public\\pmp.dat privilege::debug sekurlsa::logonPasswords\n\nDetecting usage of Mimikatz-like tools\n\nSince the Lazarus Group did not obfuscate commonly used functions from the Mimikatz tool,\nblue teams can detect commonly used Mimikatz functions in command line arguments with\n[an existing Sigma rule[15].](https://github.com/Neo23x0/sigma/blob/master/rules/windows/process_creation/win_mimikatz_command_line.yml)\n\nApart from the quick win above, blue teams can also hunt for processes accessing the\nLSASS process. For example, running Mimikatz with the arguments\nSEKURLSA::LogonPasswords will cause Mimikatz to dump password data from the LSASS\nprocess memory for recently logged on accounts as well as services running under the\n[context of user credentials[16]. This generates a process access event, which is created](https://adsecurity.org/?page_id=1821#SEKURLSALogonPasswords)\nwhen a process accesses another process. This behavior usually occurs as a result of\n[reading and writing to the memory address space of the target process[17]. In this case, the](https://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/securitylog/encyclopedia/event.aspx?eventid=90010)\ntarget process is Lsass.exe and credentials are read from its address space. An existing\n[Sigma rule is available to detect this behavior[18].](https://github.com/Neo23x0/sigma/blob/master/rules/windows/process_access/sysmon_cred_dump_lsass_access.yml)\n\n## Lateral Movement\n\n\n-----\n\n### T1053.005 – Scheduled Task/Job: Scheduled Task\n\nLeveraging scheduled tasks for lateral movement is a very common technique. The Lazarus\nGroup used scheduled tasks to modify the\n“HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Lsa\\Security Packages” registry key on a remote\nmachine:\n\ncmd.exe /c \"schtasks /Create /S <IP ADDRESS> /P <PASSWORD>! /U \"<DOMAIN>\\\n<USER> \" /TN \"MSC\" /TR \"reg add\n/\"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Lsa/\" /v /\"Security\nPackages/\" /t REG_MULTI_SZ /d /\"ldap/\" /f\" /SC ONSTART /RU SYSTEM /F\n>C:\\Windows\\TEMP\\TMPD2E6.tmp 2>&1\"\n\n**Detection**\n\nSimply detecting the use of the Schtasks utility can be challenging as it is widely used by\nlegitimate Windows applications and for administrative purposes. However, we can reduce\nthe number of false positives by detecting the creation of a scheduled task for the purpose of\nlaunching anomalous programs.\n\nSuspicious scheduled task creation\n\nThe Lazarus Group's scheduled task creation can be considered anomalous behavior as\nReg.exe is rarely executed by the scheduled task utility. Therefore, monitoring for the use of\nthe Reg.exe utility in a scheduled task creation command can prove to be an effective\ndetection strategy. Another example for anomalous programs originating from a scheduled\ntask is encoded PowerShell. While encoded PowerShell alone is not a high-fidelity detection,\nwe have found that hunting for scheduled tasks being created with encoded PowerShell as\nthe “scheduled action” has a low false positive rate, often indicating persistence or lateral\nmovement activity. The Sigma rule created to detect this behavior can be found on our\nGitHub and is named win_anom_schtasks_creation.\n\nRemote scheduled task creation\n\nAnother opportunity for detection would be the use of command line options \"/S\", “/U” and\n\"/P\", which are used to specify the IP address for a remote computer, the user context under\nwhich Schtasks.exe should run, and the password for a given user context respectively.\nWhile these command line options can be used legitimately to create scheduled tasks on\nremote machines, they are not commonly observed based on historical data from F-Secure\nCountercept. The Sigma rule created to detect this behavior can be found on our GitHub and\nis named win_remote_schtasks_creation.\n\nSuspicious scheduled task execution\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile the creation of remote scheduled tasks is often observed on the first compromised\nhost to move laterally to other hosts in the network, the tasks themselves will eventually\nexecute on these hosts. Thus, it would also be valuable to build detections for suspicious\nprocesses that are executed by the Windows Task Scheduler.\n\nThis can be achieved by detecting a combination of suspicious processes or processes that\nare commonly used to launch suspicious scripts; examples include Cmd.exe,\nPowershell.exe, Cscript.exe and Reg.exe. For these processes we can filter for where the\nparent process is either Windows Task Scheduler Service (“svchost.exe -k netsvcs –p -s\nSchedule”) or Windows Task Scheduler Engine (Taskeng.exe). We observed some\ndifference in scheduled tasks execution in different versions of Windows. In newer versions\nsuch as Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016, scheduled tasks are executed directly from\nWindows Task Scheduler Service where older versions like Windows 7 and Windows Server\n2012 are executed from Windows Task Scheduler Engine.\n\nThe Sigma rule created to detect this behavior can be found on our GitHub and is named\nwin_susp_schtasks_execution. However, it is worth noting that during testing we found that\nwithout any tuning this rule will often trigger false positives, especially in environments where\nscheduled tasks are used to regularly run custom administrative scripts. Therefore, blue\nteams should identify and exclude any known administrative scripts in the detection rule\nbefore implementation in production environments.\n\n### T1021.001 – Remote services: Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)\n\n T1021.005 – Remote Services: Virtual Network Computing (VNC)\n\nWith the credentials acquired using the techniques explained in the Credential Access\nsection, the Lazarus Group were able to move laterally across the network. To achieve this,\nthey made use of common remote services such as RDP and VNC.\n\n**Detection**\n\nIt is challenging to write detection rules for the use of RDP and VNC as they are generally\nwidely used within networks of all sizes for legitimate purposes. Context is crucial for such\nactivities, and malicious activity is often only apparent by looking at a combination of user\nand endpoint activity across many systems on the network over hours or days, rather than\nfocusing on a single event on a single endpoint.\n\nTo combat this detection challenge, at F-Secure Countercept we use User Behavior\nAnalytics (UBA), a technique focused on detecting when users perform new activity that they\nhave not performed historically.\n\n\n-----\n\nTraditionally, blue teams focus has been on detecting generic bad behavior. As with most\nof the content in this detection report, it involves searching for a wide variety of offensive\ntactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and general anomalies that relate to them. UBA\ndiffers from this in that it focuses on detecting anomalies based on user behavior, regardless\nof whether any offensive techniques have been used. This focus makes it a perfect\ncomplement to our traditional focus and has the potential to fill in some key detection gaps.\n\nFor example, by analyzing 4624 and 4648 logon events from Windows security Event Logs,\nit is possible to identify when a standard user account authenticates to multiple new (for that\nuser) endpoints, which can be an indication of lateral movement.\n\n## Command and Control\n\n### TA0011 – Command and Control\n\nThe Lazarus Group leveraged a network backdoor implant to communicate with the victim’s\nnetwork. The built-in Windows utility Netsh was used to open a port in the Windows Firewall\nwhen the port number was passed as an input argument to the implant Mcc.exe, as seen\nbelow:\n\nC:\\ProgramData\\mcc.exe 3388 netsh firewall add portopening TCP 3388 Assistance\n\nThe network backdoor then listens on the opened port and can execute any command it\n[receives via the listening port.[19] In order do that, the backdoor executable will run](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/04/03/lazarus-killdisk-central-american-casino/)\nCmd.exe with the command that it received from the C&C server.\n\n**Detection**\n\nDetection for this type of network backdoor on the endpoint can be achieved by looking for\nthe process creation of the Netsh utility with command line arguments “firewall add\nportopening”. An existing Sigma rule is already available to detect when a port or application\n[is allowed through the firewall via the Netsh utility[20].](https://github.com/Neo23x0/sigma/blob/master/rules/windows/process_creation/win_netsh_fw_add.yml)\n\nHowever, this detection is also prone to false positives from legitimate administrative\nprocesses such as Spoolsv.exe (the spooler service which manages print jobs). Therefore,\nblue teams should verify the parent process and correlate with other events to exclude false\npositives.\n\nIn this scenario, a hunt query can be an effective complement to the existing detection rule.\nDefenders can query for Netsh.exe processes launched with arguments containing “firewall\nadd portopening” and then aggregate the results based on the parent process. This should\nreturn a list of processes that use Netsh to open a port in the Windows Firewall. Blue teams\ncan then filter out known legitimate processes from the hunt results and whitelist them in the\ndetection rule.\n\n\n-----\n\nAnother suspicious execution characteristic of the mcc.exe binary was its location on disk.\nThe “C:\\ProgramData\\” directory is a commonly used location for attackers / malware as it is\nwriteable by any authenticated user and has execution permissions by default on Windows.\nAlthough legitimate programs are often installed and executed from within the\n“C:\\ProgramData” directory, these executables are often stored within subfolders specific to\nthat application. In contrast to this normal behavior, the mcc.exe binary used by the Lazarus\nGroup was not stored in a subdirectory of the “C:\\ProgramData” folder and was instead\nstored directly under the “ProgramData” directory. Combining this information with the\nknowledge that the mcc.exe binary would launch cmd.exe as a child process to execute\nreceived commands, we can build a detection for executables being launched where the\nparent executable is located in the “root” of the “C:\\ProgramData” folder.\n\nThis rule can be found on our GitHub and is named win_susp_exec_programdata. During\ntesting this rule resulted in a very low false positive rate when run against F-Secure\nCountercept endpoint data.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Lazarus Group invested significant effort into evading defenses in this instance. This is\napparent from the breakdown of the campaign and the association of the various TTPs to the\nMITRE ATT&CK framework. The Group demonstrated a strong sense of operational security\nawareness by disabling built-in defenses, removing indicators of compromise, and leveraging\nprocess injection and signed binaries to hide their presence and blend in with normal\nnetwork traffic.\n\nOur findings highlight the importance of capturing and leveraging endpoint telemetry for early\ndetection of compromise as well as increased visibility into the threat actor’s chain of\nactivities following initial access.\n\nMost of the endpoint telemetry used for detection throughout this post series can be easily\n[logged by using existing Windows utilities. For example, System Monitor (Sysmon)[21] can](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon)\nbe installed on endpoints to log specific events such as process creation, image load and\nprocess access. Alternatively, blue teams can directly tap into Event Tracing for Windows\n[(ETW)[22], which is a powerful kernel-level trace collection system built-in to the Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/etw/about-event-tracing)\nOperating System. ETW can also be used by Sysmon to further enhance visibility into\nendpoint behavior.\n\nAlthough we have provided Sigma rules throughout this blog series, this does not necessarily\nmean that they can be used “as is” to produce detection results. In fact, a lot of work needs\nto be done before rule implementation. This involves building a data pipeline, aggregating\nthe correct datasets, and adapting the Sigma rules to the existing log collection/SIEM\nformats before the detection rules can be used to alert on suspicious activity.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe believe that these two blog posts can be of great use to organizations seeking to improve\ntheir detection capabilities. Although the provided Sigma rules were created from Threat\nIntelligence on the Lazarus Group, the detection logic covers a wide range of TTPs that are\nused by a wide range of threat actors. The provided Sigma rules have not been directly\nimplemented in a real production environment, but our internal rules follow a similar format,\nare built with similar detection logic, and have been tested with existing telemetry. This\nmeans that common false positives have been studied and excluded, which is a benefit for\nsmaller organizations which might not have the resources to do this kind of work, but also for\nlarger organizations to improve their detection at scale.\n\n[All of the Sigma rules referenced throughout this blog series can be found here.](https://github.com/countercept/lazarus-sigma-rules)\n\n\n-----",
