So far the campaign has targeted several enterprises, while\nencrypting hundreds of PC, storage and data centers in each infected company.\n\nWhile the ransomware’s technical capabilities are relatively low, at least three organizations\n[in the US and worldwide were severely hit by the malware. Furthermore, some organizations](https://www.checkpoint.com/cyber-hub/threat-prevention/what-is-malware/)\npaid an exceptionally large ransom in order to retrieve their files. Although the ransom\namount itself varies among the victims (ranging between 15 BTC to 50 BTC) it has already\nnetted the attackers over $640,000.\n\nCuriously, our research lead us to connect the nature of Ryuk’s campaign and some of its\ninner-workings to the HERMES ransomware, a malware commonly attributed to the\nnotorious North Korean APT Lazarus Group, which was also used in massive targeted\nattacks. This leads us to believe that the current wave of targeted attacks using Ryuk may\neither be the work of the HERMES operators, the allegedly North Korean group, or the work\nof an actor who has obtained the HERMES source code.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the below analysis we review the highly targeted attacks that Ryuk has been involved in\nand make a detailed comparison between it and the notorious HERMES ransomware used in\nother operations. We also address the financial aspects of the campaign and illustrate how,\nthrough tracking the money trail, Ryuk’s authors seem to want to disguise their received\npayments by dividing and transferring them among multiple wallets.\n\n**An Overview of Ryuk**\n\nUnlike the common ransomware, systematically distributed via massive spam campaigns\nand exploit kits, Ryuk is used exclusively for tailored attacks. In fact, its encryption scheme is\nintentionally built for small-scale operations, such that only crucial assets and resources are\ninfected in each targeted network with its infection and distribution carried out manually by\nthe attackers.\n\nThis, of course, means extensive network mapping, hacking and credential collection is\nrequired and takes place prior to each operation. Its alleged attribution to Lazarus Group,\ndiscussed later in this post, may imply that the attackers are already well experienced in the\ntargeted attacks domain, as seen by attacks such as the breach of Sony Pictures in 2014.\n\n**Ryuk’s Ransom Note**\n\nWhile no differences were found in the collected samples, two versions of ransom notes\nwere sent to victims; a longer, well-worded and nicely phrased note, which led to the highest\nrecorded payment of 50 BTC (around $320,000), and a shorter, more blunt note, which was\nsent to various other organizations and also led to some fine ransom payments ranging\nbetween 15-35 BTC (up to $224,000). This could imply there may be two levels of offensive.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 1: Ransom Note #1; a pleasant, well-phrase note.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 2: Ransom Note #2; a shorter, less detailed note.**\n\n**Ryuk vs HERMES**\n\nThe HERMES ransomware first gained publicity in October 2017 when it was used as part of\nthe targeted attack against the Far Eastern International Bank (FEIB) in Taiwan. In that\nattack, commonly attributed to the Lazarus Group, a hefty $60 million was stolen in a\nsophisticated SWIFT attack, though was later retrieved. In this case, it seems the HERMES\nransomware was delivered to the bank network as a diversion.\n\nIn the case of Ryuk, however, there is no doubt that the latest ransomware attacks seen over\nthe past two weeks are by no means just a side-show but rather the main act. Indeed, with\nransom payment as high as those already paid, Ryuk is definitely getting hitting the right note\namongst its audience, or rather its victims.\n\nThe following technical comparison of Ryuk and HERMES leads us to believe that whoever\nwrote the malware was either in possession of the HERMES ransomware source code or is\npossibly even the same threat actor reusing code for yet another round of targeted attacks.\n\n**Malware Comparison**\n\nAn interesting finding that arises when inspecting Ryuk’s code is that its encryption logic\n[resembles that found in the HERMES ransomware, as outlined previously by Malwarebytes.](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2018/03/hermes-ransomware-distributed-to-south-koreans-via-recent-flash-zero-day/)\n\n\n-----\n\nIndeed, if we compare the function that encrypts a single file, we see much similarity in its\nstructure, as depicted in the following call flow graphs:\n\n**Figure 3: Call flow graphs of the encryption functions in Ryuk and Hermes.**\n\nIn fact, it seems that the author of Ryuk did not even bother to change the marker in the\nencrypted files as the code used to generate, place and verify this marker in order to\ndetermine if a file was already encrypted are identical in both malwares:\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 4: Marker generation in Ryuk and Hermes.**\n\n**Figure 5: Marker check in Ryuk and Hermes.**\n\nAdditionally, the function that invokes the aforementioned routine conducts very similar\nactions in both cases. For instance, both whitelist similar folders (e.g. “Ahnlab”, “Microsoft”,\n“$Recycle.Bin” etc.) to avoid file encryption of files stored in them. Also, both write a batch\nscript named “window.bat” in the same path, with a similar script used to delete shadow\nvolumes and backup files. Likewise, in both cases there are files dropped to disk (“PUBLIC”\nand “UNIQUE_ID_DO_NOT_REMOVE”) which resemble in name and purpose.\n\nIt should also be noted that all the above logic is preserved in both the 32 and 64 bit versions\nof Ryuk that we had samples of. Such similarity of code across different architectures might\nwell be a sign of an underlying identical source code.\n\n**Technical Analysis**\n\n\n-----\n\n**The Dropper**\n\nThe dropper of Ryuk is simple and fairly straightforward. It contains 32 and 64 bit modules of\nthe ransomware, embedded one after the other in the dropper’s binary. At the beginning of\nits execution, the dropper generates a 5-lettered random file name using the srand function\nand GetTickCount for seed generation.\n\nThe aforementioned payload files are then written to a directory, depending on the version of\nWindows on victim’s computer. If the version is Windows XP or Windows 2000, the file is\ncreated in the directory “\\Documents and Settings\\Default User\\”, otherwise it is created in\n“\\users\\Public\\”.\n\nIf the file creation fails, the dropper attempts to write it in its own directory, using its own\nname and appending the letter ‘V’ as the last character.\n\nAfter creating the file, the dropper then checks whether the process is run under Wow64, and\nwrites the suitable payload (32 or 64 bit) depending on the result of the check.\n\nFinally, before terminating, the dropper calls ShellExecuteW to execute the Ryuk\nransomware payload it has just written.\n\n**Ransomware Binary**\n\nUpon execution, the Ryuk ransomware conducts a Sleep of several seconds and then\nchecks whether it was executed with an argument. If such was passed, it will use it as a path\nto a file that is deleted using DeleteFileW. Based on the malware’s dropper code, this\nargument would be the path to the dropper itself. Following this, the ransomware will kill\nmore than 40 processes and stop more than 180 services by executing taskkill and net stop\non a list of predefined service and process names. These services and processes are mostly\nbelonging to antivirus, database, backup and document editing software.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 6: Partial list of killed processes and services.**\n\n**Persistence & Process Enumeration**\n\nTo make sure the malware is executed after reboot, Ryuk uses a straight forward persistence\ntechnique, whereby it writes itself to the Run registry key using the following command:\n\n‘reg add /C REG ADD\n“HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run” /v “svchos”\n/t REG_SZ /d’\n\nIt will then try to elevate to SeDebugPrivilege so as to have extended capabilities in\nsubsequent actions and prepare for injection by forming an array of structures. Each entry in\nthe array represents a running process in the system and contains the process’ name, PID,\nand a number which represents the account type of its owner (as outlined in the figure\n\n\n-----\n\nbelow). After putting the aforementioned process list together, Ryuk will iterate over it and try\nto inject a code to each process’s address space, as long as its name is not “explorer.exe”,\n“csrss.exe” or “lsaas.exe”, or is not run by NT AUTHORITY.\n\n**Figure 7: An array entry representing a running process in the system.**\n\n**The Injection Method**\n\nRyuk uses a rather basic injection technique, whereby it first gets a handle on the target\nprocess using OpenProcess and allocates a buffer in its address space using VirtualAllocEx.\nThe allocated buffer would have the size of the malware’s image and would be required to be\npositioned at the same base address.\n\nThe malware will then write its current virtual image content into it and create a thread that\nwill carry out some actions, as described in the next section. Note that by writing the virtual\nimage into a requested buffer with a predefined allocation base, and with the lack of a proper\ncode relocation procedure, Ryuk is taking the risk that the requested address is not available\nfor allocation, thus causing a potential failure in the execution of the injected code.\n\n**Figure 8: The injection method and bug that causes it to fail.**\n\n**The Injected Code**\n\nThe injected code holds the core functionality used by the ransomware for file encryption. It\nis started by decrypting a list of API function name strings using a predefined key and an\narray of the string lengths which is then used to dynamically load the corresponding\nfunctions.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn order to ease the decryption process during analysis, we created an IDA Python script that\nwill automatically decrypt these strings and rename the relevant variables. The script can be\nfound in the Appendix below.\n\nFollowing this, the malware will attempt to write a dummy file to the Windows directory, which\nwould only be allowed with Admin privileges. If the creation of the file failed, it will sleep for a\nwhile and attempt the same another five times. If failure persists beyond these attempts,\nRyuk will simply terminate.\n\nIf the file was successfully created, it will write two more files to a subfolder in the Windows\ndirectory. The first is a file named “PUBLIC” which contains an RSA Public key, and the\nsecond is “UNIQUE_ID_DO_NOT_REMOVE” that contains a hardcoded key. Both are\nleveraged for the purpose of encryption as outlined in the following section.\n\n**The Encryption Scheme**\n\nThe ransomware uses a relatively straightforward three-tier trust model. At the root of the\ntrust model, as is typical in robust ransomware implementations, is the global RSA key pair\nheld by the attackers. The private key from this key pair is not visible to the victim at any\npoint during infection.\n\nThe second tier is a per-victim RSA keypair. Typically a ransomware would generate this\nkeypair on-the-fly, and then immediately encrypt the resulting private key using the higher-tier\nglobal key. Instead, the ransomware comes with this keypair pre-embedded and the private\nkey pre-encrypted. This is a somewhat unorthodox approach, which may be vulnerable to a\n‘pay-once, decrypt-many’ attack if the same sample is used to infect multiple victims, or if the\nsame keypair is embedded in multiple samples. But given that a fresh key pair is generated\nfor each new sample, it is a secure model.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 9: the embedded per-victim RSA public key (note the initial bytes 06 02).**\n\n**Figure 10: The embedded per-victim RSA private key that has been encrypted**\n\nwith the campaign global key (note the initial bytes 07 02).\n\nThe third tier is a standard AES symmetric encryption key generated per victim file using the\nWin32API function CryptGenKey. The key is then exported using CryptExportKey, encrypted\nusing the second-tier key, and the encrypted result appended to the encrypted file. In a truly\nextraordinary turn of events, the authors actually read the documentation of CryptExportKey\nand provided the second-tier key as the hExpKey parameter, which is there exactly to\nprovide this functionality. Most ransomware exports the AES key in plain and then encrypts\nthe result using CryptEncrypt, or some such.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 11: Assembly that generates the per-file AES key;**\nthis is a part of the ransomware’s “encrypt file” routine.\n\nOnce all cryptographic primitives are in place, the ransomware performs a standard\nrecursive sweep of every drive and network share on the victim system, and encrypts every\nfile and directory except for any file or directory containing text from a hardcoded whitelist,\nwhich includes “Windows”, “Mozilla”, “Chrome”, “RecycleBin” and “Ahnlab”. It’s clear why the\nattackers would want the victim’s web browser intact given that it may be required for reading\nthe ransom note, purchasing cryptocurrency and so on. But it is less clear why the attackers\nare concerned with encrypting the victim’s copy of a South Korean endpoint protection\nproduct, especially given that this attack wasn’t even targeted at South Korean users.\n\nThis bit in particular is one piece of a larger puzzle of how the HERMES ransomware came\nto be re-used and rebranded as “Ryuk” ransomware. Apart from the obvious re-labeling in\nthe readme file and so on, there are subtle differences in the trust model.\n\n[According to a report by Malwarebytes, the original HERMES actually generated the tier-two](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2018/03/HERMES-ransomware-distributed-to-south-koreans-via-recent-flash-zero-day/)\nper-victim RSA keypairs, as opposed to embedding hard-coded copies in the malware\nsamples. But the encryption function itself, including the encrypted file format and its\nassociated unique “HERMES” file magic, are reproduced wholesale in the rebranded\nversion; as is the check for “AhnLab”-related files, which isn’t even relevant to Ryuk’s\nintended victims.\n\n**Figure 12: Hex dump of a file encrypted by Ryuk ransomware.**\nThe file structure is visibly identical to the one used in HERMES,\ndown to the distinctive ‘HERMES’ marker, which the malware uses to identify files which it\n\n\n-----\n\nhas already encrypted.\n\nIn addition to local drives, Ryuk will also try to encrypt network resources. First, it will start\ntheir enumeration by calling WNetOpenEnum, and then allocate a zero-initialized buffer. This\nbuffer will be filled throughout a call to the WNetEnumResource function. If the enumerated\nresource is a container for other resources, the ransomware will call its network resources\nenumeration function recursively.\n\nFor each network resource found by Ryuk, the resource’s name will be appended and\nseparated with a semicolon to a list that will later be used to encrypt these network\nresources.\n\nFinally, Ryuk will destroy its encryption key and execute a .BAT file that will delete shadow\ncopies and various backup files from the disk.\n\n**Figure 13: List of Batch commands to be executed by Ryuk after encrypting the system.**\n\n**Following the Money**\n\nRyuk ransomware has not been widely distributed. Similarly to its forefather, HERMES, it has\nonly been used in targeted attacks, which makes it a lot harder to track the malware author’s\nactivities and revenues. Almost each malware sample was provided a unique wallet and\nshortly after the ransom payment was made, the funds were divided and transmitted through\nmultiple other accounts.\n\nHowever, examining the currency transactions directly from the wallet provided in the ransom\nnote onwards exposed a pattern, which enabled us to pinpoint wallets that would most likely\nbe used for monetization. We were also able to spot a connection between these wallets, as\n\n\n-----\n\nfunds paid to them were transferred to several key wallets at a certain point. This may\nindicate that a coordinated operation, in which several companies have been carefully\ntargeted, is currently taking place using the Ryuk ransomware.\n\nAfter a ransom payment was made to a preassigned wallet, some 25% of the funds (a round\namount such as 10 or 12.5 BTC) are transferred to a new wallet. These funds can still be\nfound at that same new wallet that was created for them. We can assume that these wallets\nwill later be cashed out. The remaining amount, indeed the majority of the original amount, is\nalso transferred to a new wallet; however, the remaining funds are split and relocated again –\nsome 25% of it is transferred to a new wallet in which it would remain, with the other funds\nsplit again, and so on.\n\nInterestingly, several wallets were used more than others, as several transactions originating\nin different ransom payments were made to them. These key wallets were in fact the link\nbetween the original ransom payments, and enabled us to measure the extent of these\ncoordinated targeted attacks delivering the Ryuk ransomware. The pattern we uncovered is\npresented in the chart below.\n\n**Figure 14: Bitcoin Transaction Flow, from the ransom payment to the cashing out stage.**\n\n**Conclusions**\n\nFrom the exploitation phase through to the encryption process and up to the ransom demand\nitself, the carefully operated Ryuk campaign is targeting enterprises that are capable of\npaying a lot of money in order to get back on track.\n\n\n-----\n\nBoth the nature of the attack and the malware s own inner workings tie Ryuk to the HERMES\nransomware and arouse curiosity regarding the identity of the group behind it and its\nconnection to the Lazarus Group. After succeeding with infecting and getting paid some\n$640,000, we believe that this is not the end of this campaign and that additional\norganizations are likely to fall victim to Ryuk.\n\nCheck Point’s [SandBlast Agent Anti-Ransomware product protects against Ryuk](https://www.checkpoint.com/products/advanced-endpoint-protection/)\n[ransomware.
