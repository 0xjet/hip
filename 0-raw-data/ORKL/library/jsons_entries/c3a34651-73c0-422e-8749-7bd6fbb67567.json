The app is “Todo: Day manager,” and has over 1,000 downloads.\nThis is the latest in a disturbing string of hidden malware in the Google Play store: in the last 3 months,\nThreatLabz has reported over 50+ apps resulting in 500k+ downloads, embedding such malware families\nas Joker, Harly, Coper, and Adfraud.\n\n_Fig no 1.Malware Installer From Play Store_\n\nXenomorph is a trojan that steals credentials from banking applications on users’ devices. It is also\ncapable of intercepting users’ SMS messages and notifications, enabling it to steal one-time passwords\nand multifactor authentication requests.\n\nOur analysis found that the Xenomorph banking malware is dropped from GitHub as a fake Google\nService application upon installation of the app. It starts with asking users to enable access permission.\nOnce provided, it adds itself as a device admin and prevents users from disabling Device Admin, making it\nuninstallable from the phone. Xenomorph creates an overlay onto legit banking applications to trick users\ninto entering their credentials.\n\n\n-----\n\n[A similar infection cycle was observed three months ago with the Coper banking trojan. This trojan was](https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/joker-facestealer-and-coper-banking-malwares-google-play-store)\nsimilarly embedded in apps on the Google Play store, and sourced its malware payload from the Github\nrepo.\n\n## Technical Details\n\nBelow is the Xenomorph infection cycle once a user downloads an app and opens it.\n\n_Fig no 2.Flow of infection_\n\nWhen the app is first opened, it reaches out to a Firebase server to get the stage/banking malware\npayload URL. It then downloads the malicious Xenomorph banking trojan samples from Github. This\nbanking malware later reaches out to the command-and-control (C2) servers decoded either via Telegram\npage content or from a static code routine to request further commands, extending the infection.\n\nThe parent malware downloader (Google Play Store) application gets its config from Firebase for its\ndatabase.\n\n_Fig no 3. Malware enables downloader._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Fig no 4. Downloader not enabled._\n\nAs shown in the above screen shot, the malware will only download further banking payloads if the\n“Enabled” parameter is set to true.\n\nThe following screenshot shows how the Firebase database malware uses Github links to download\nXenomorph payloads:\n\n_Fig no 5. The malware writes dropper URLs in local DB of firebase_\n\nThe screenshots in Figures 6 and 7 below show the C2 retrieval from a Telegram page. Here the banking\npayload has the Telegram page link encoded with RC4 encryption. Upon execution, the banking payload\nwill reach out to the Telegram page and download the content hosted on that page.\n\n_Fig no 6.Uses Telegram link response to create C2 in addition to static encrypted C2 present in app_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Fig no 7. Telegram channel preview where string in between hearts emoji is used to create C2_\n\nAs per the following screenshot, the payload will decrypt the C2 server address from the downloaded\ncontent:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Fig no 8. Decode C2 from Telegram_\n\nThreatLabz also observed RC4 encoded C2 domains stored inside the code. The following screenshot\nshows the C2 request in which the payload sends all the installed applications to C2 in order to receive\nfurther instructions. In one case, it will present the fake login page of a targeted banking application if the\nlegitimate application is installed in the infected device.\n\n_Fig no 9. Malware uploading all package information to receive commands_\n\n\n-----\n\nThreatLabz also observed another application, named 経費キ パ (Expense Keeper), exhibiting similar\nbehavior. On execution of this application, it is observed that the “Enabled parameter” is set to false, same\nas the execution previously shown in Figure 4. Due to that, it was not possible to retrieve the Dropper URL\nfor the banking payload. ThreatLabz is working with the Google Security team for the same.\n\n_Fig no 10.

Such bank phishing\ninstallers most of the time rely on tricking users to install malicious applications. Users are advised to keep\nan eye on what application is being installed. A Play Store application is not supposed to side load or ask\nusers to install from unknown sources. We believe hostile phishing downloaders will further increase in\nprevalence in the future. User vigilance is of the utmost importance to defeat these phishing campaigns.\n\n\n-----",
