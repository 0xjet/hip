    "plain_text": "# in the footsteps of HackingTeam\n\n###### By Nikita Buchka, Alexey Firsh on January 16, 2018. 10:00 am\n\nAt the beginning of October 2017, we discovered new Android spyware\n\nwith several features previously unseen in the wild. In the course of\n\nfurther research, we found a number of related samples that point to a\n\nlong-term development process. We believe the initial versions of this\n\nmalware were created at least three years ago – at the end of 2014. Since\n\nthen, the implant’s functionality has been improving and remarkable new\n\nfeatures implemented, such as the ability to record audio surroundings via\n\nthe microphone when an infected device is in a specified location; the\n\nstealing of WhatsApp messages via Accessibility Services; and the ability\n\nto connect an infected device to Wi-Fi networks controlled by\n\ncybercriminals.\n\nWe observed many web landing pages that mimic the sites of mobile\n\noperators and which are used to spread the Android implants. These\n\ndomains have been registered by the attackers since 2015. According to\n\nour telemetry, that was the year the distribution campaign was at its most\n\nactive. The activities continue: the most recently observed domain was\n\nregistered on October 31, 2017. Based on our KSN statistics, there are\n\nseveral infected individuals, exclusively in Italy.\n\nMoreover, as we dived deeper into the investigation, we discovered\n\nseveral spyware tools for Windows that form an implant for exfiltrating\n\nsensitive data on a targeted machine. The version we found was built at\n\nthe beginning of 2017, and at the moment we are not sure whether this\n\nimplant has been used in the wild.\n\nWe named the malware Skygofree, because we found the word in one of\n\nthe domains*.\n\n## Malware Features\n\n### Android\n\nAccording to the observed samples and their signatures, early versions of\n\n\n-----\n\n_Signature of one of the earliest versions_\n\nThe code and functionality have changed numerous times; from simple\n\nunobfuscated malware at the beginning to sophisticated multi-stage\n\nspyware that gives attackers full remote control of the infected device.\n\nWe have examined all the detected versions, including the latest one that\n\nis signed by a certificate valid from September 14, 2017.\n\nThe implant provides the ability to grab a lot of exfiltrated data, like call\n\nrecords, text messages, geolocation, surrounding audio, calendar events,\n\nand other memory information stored on the device.\n\nAfter manual launch, it shows a fake welcome notification to the user:\n\n_Dear Customer, we’re updating your configuration and it will be ready as_\n\n_soon as possible._\n\nAt the same time, it hides an icon and starts background services to hide\n\nfurther actions from the user.\n\nService Name Purpose\n\nUploading last recorded .amr\nAndroidAlarmManager\n\naudio\n\nAndroidSystemService Audio recording\n\nLocation tracking with\nAndroidSystemQueues\n\nmovement detection\n\nClearSystems GSM tracking (CID, LAC, PSC)\n\nClipService Clipboard stealing\n\nAndroidFileManager Uploading all exfiltrated data\n\n\nXMPP С&C protocol\nAndroidPush\n\n(url.plus:5223)\n\nRegistration on C&C via HTTP\nRegistrationService\n\n(url.plus/app/pro/)\n\nInterestingly, a self-protection feature was implemented in almost every\n\nservice. Since in Android 8.0 (SDK API 26) the system is able to kill idle\n\nservices, this code raises a fake update notification to prevent it:\n\n\n-----\n\nCybercriminals have the ability to control the implant via HTTP, XMPP,\n\n[binary SMS and FirebaseCloudMessaging (or GoogleCloudMessaging in](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/)\n\nolder versions) protocols. Such a diversity of protocols gives the attackers\n\nmore flexible control. In the latest implant versions there are 48 different\n\ncommands. You can find a full list with short descriptions in the Appendix.\n\nHere are some of the most notable:\n\n‘geofence’ – this command adds a specified location to the implant’s\n\ninternal database and when it matches a device’s current location the\n\nmalware triggers and begins to record surrounding audio.\n\n”social” – this command that starts the ‘AndroidMDMSupport’ service\n\n– this allows the files of any other installed application to be grabbed.\n\nThe service name makes it clear that by applications the attackers\n\nmean MDM solutions that are business-specific tools. The operator\n\ncan specify a path with the database of any targeted application and\n\nserver-side PHP script name for uploading.\n\n_Several hardcoded applications targeted by the MDM-grabbing_\n\n_command_\n\n‘wifi’ – this command creates a new Wi-Fi connection with specified\n\nconfigurations from the command and enable Wi-Fi if it is disabled.\n\nSo, when a device connects to the established network, this process\n\nwill be in silent and automatic mode. This command is used to\n\nconnect the victim to a Wi-Fi network controlled by the\n\ncybercriminals to perform traffic sniffing and man-in-the-middle\n\n(MitM) attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\n_addWifiConfig method code fragments_\n\n‘camera’ – this command records a video/capture a photo using the\n\nfront-facing camera when someone next unlocks the device.\n\nSome versions of the Skygofree feature the self-protection ability\n\nexclusively for Huawei devices. There is a ‘protected apps’ list in this\n\nbrand’s smartphones, related to a battery-saving concept. Apps not\n\nselected as protected apps stop working once the screen is off and await\n\nre-activation, so the implant is able to determine that it is running on a\n\nHuawei device and add itself to this list. Due to this feature, it is clear that\n\nthe developers paid special attention to the work of the implant on\n\nHuawei devices.\n\nAlso, we found a debug version of the implant\n\n(70a937b2504b3ad6c623581424c7e53d) that contains interesting\n\nconstants, including the version of the spyware.\n\n_Debug BuildConfig with the version_\n\nAfter a deep analysis of all discovered versions of Skygofree, we made an\n\napproximate timeline of the implant’s evolution.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Mobile implant evolution timeline_\n\nHowever, some facts indicate that the APK samples from stage two can\n\nalso be used separately as the first step of the infection. Below is a list of\n\nthe payloads used by the Skygofree implant in the second and third\n\nstages.\n\n##### Reverse shell payload\n\nThe reverse shell module is an external ELF file compiled by the attackers\n\nto run on Android. The choice of a particular payload is determined by the\n\nimplant’s version, and it can be downloaded from the command and\n\ncontrol (C&C) server soon after the implant starts, or after a specific\n\ncommand. In the most recent case, the choice of the payload zip file\n\ndepends on the device process architecture. For now, we observe only\n\none payload version for following the ARM CPUs: arm64-v8a, armeabi,\n\narmeabi-v7a.\n\nNote that in almost all cases, this payload file, contained in zip archives, is\n\nnamed ‘setting’ or ‘setting.o’.\n\nThe main purpose of this module is providing reverse shell features on the\n\ndevice by connecting with the C&C server’s socket.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Reverse shell payload_\n\nThe payload is started by the main module with a specified host and port\n\nas a parameter that is hardcoded to ‘54.67.109.199’ and ‘30010’ in some\n\nversions:\n\nAlternatively, they could be hardcoded directly into the payload code:\n\nWe also observed variants that were equipped with similar reverse shell\n\npayloads directly in the main APK /lib/ path.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Equipped reverse shell payload with specific string_\n\nAfter an in-depth look, we found that some versions of the reverse shell\n\npayload code share similarities with PRISM – a stealth reverse shell\n\n[backdoor that is available on Github.](https://github.com/andreafabrizi/prism/)\n\n_Reverse shell payload from update_dev.zip_\n\n##### Exploit payload\n\nAt the same time, we found an important payload binary that is trying to\n\nexploit several known vulnerabilities and escalate privileges. According to\n\nseveral timestamps, this payload is used by implant versions created since\n\n2016. It can also be downloaded by a specific command. The exploit\n\npayload contains following file components:\n\nComponent name Description\n\nrun_root_shell/arrs_put_user.o/arrs_put_user/poc Exploit ELF\n\nSqlite3 tool\ndb\n\nELF\n\nSqlite3\n\ndatabase\n\nwith\n\nsupported\n\n\ndevice.db\n\n\ndevices and\n\ntheir\n\nconstants\n\nneeded for\n\nprivilege\n\nescalation\n\n\n-----\n\n‘supported_devices’ and ‘device_address’. The first table contains 205\n\ndevices with some Linux properties; the second contains the specific\n\nmemory addresses associated with them that are needed for successful\n\nexploitation. You can find a full list of targeted models in the Appendix.\n\n_Fragment of the database with targeted devices and specific memory_\n\n_addresses_\n\nIf the infected device is not listed in this database, the exploit tries to\n\ndiscover these addresses programmatically.\n\nAfter downloading and unpacking, the main module executes the exploit\n\nbinary file. Once executed, the module attempts to get root privileges on\n\nthe device by exploiting the following vulnerabilities:\n\n\nCVE-2013-2094\n\nCVE-2013-2595\n\nCVE-2013-6282\n\n[CVE-2014-3153 (futex aka TowelRoot)](https://threatpost.com/android-root-access-vulnerability-affecting-most-devices/106683/)\n\nCVE-2015-3636\n\n\n-----\n\n_Exploitation process_\n\nAfter an in-depth look, we found that the exploit payload code shares\n\n[several similarities with the public project android-rooting-tools.](https://github.com/android-rooting-tools)\n\n_Decompiled exploit function code fragment_\n\n\n-----\n\n_run_with_mmap function from the android-rooting-tools project_\n\nAs can be seen from the comparison, there are similar strings and also a\n\nunique comment in Italian, so it looks like the attackers created this\n\nexploit payload based on android-rooting-tools project source code.\n\n##### Busybox payload\n\nBusybox is public software that provides several Linux tools in a single ELF\n\nfile. In earlier versions, it operated with shell commands like this:\n\n_Stealing WhatsApp encryption key with Busybox_\n\n##### Social payload\n\nActually, this is not a standalone payload file – in all the observed versions\n\nits code was compiled with exploit payload in one file (‘poc_perm’,\n\n‘arrs_put_user’, ‘arrs_put_user.o’). This is due to the fact that the implant\n\nneeds to escalate privileges before performing social payload actions.\n\nThis payload is also used by the earlier versions of the implant. It has\n\nsimilar functionality to the ‘AndroidMDMSupport’ command from the\n\ncurrent versions – stealing data belonging to other installed applications.\n\nThe payload will execute shell code to steal data from various\n\napplications. The example below steals Facebook data:\n\n\n-----\n\nAll the other hardcoded applications targeted by the payload:\n\nPackage name Name\n\njp.naver.line.android LINE: Free Calls & Messages\n\ncom.facebook.orca Facebook messenger\n\ncom.facebook.katana Facebook\n\ncom.whatsapp WhatsApp\n\ncom.viber.voip Viber\n\n##### Parser payload\n\nUpon receiving a specific command, the implant can download a special\n\npayload to grab sensitive information from external applications. The case\n\nwhere we observed this involved WhatsApp.\n\nIn the examined version, it was downloaded from:\n\n_hxxp://url[.]plus/Updates/tt/parser.apk_\n\nThe payload can be a .dex or .apk file which is a Java-compiled Android\n\nexecutable. After downloading, it will be loaded by the main module via\n\nDexClassLoader api:\n\nAs mentioned, we observed a payload that exclusively targets the\n\nWhatsApp messenger and it does so in an original way. The payload uses\n\nthe Android Accessibility Service to get information directly from the\n\ndisplayed elements on the screen, so it waits for the targeted application\n\nto be launched and then parses all nodes to find text messages:\n\n\n-----\n\nNote that the implant needs special permission to use the Accessibility\n\nService API, but there is a command that performs a request with a\n\nphishing text displayed to the user to obtain such permission.\n\n### Windows\n\nWe have found multiple components that form an entire spyware system\n\nfor the Windows platform.\n\nName MD5 Purpose\n\nMain\n\n\nmsconf.exe 55fb01048b6287eadcbd9a0f86d21adf\n\nnetwork.exe f673bb1d519138ced7659484c0b66c5b\n\nsystem.exe d3baa45ed342fbc5a56d974d36d5f73f\n\n\nmodule,\n\nreverse shell\n\nSending\n\nexfiltrated\n\ndata\n\nSurrounding\n\nsound\n\nrecording\n\nby mic\n\n\nupdate.exe 395f9f87df728134b5e3c1ca4d48e9fa Keylogging\n\nScreenshot\nwow.exe 16311b16fd48c1c87c6476a455093e7a\n\ncapturing\n\nSkype call\n\n\nskype_sync2.exe 6bcc3559d7405f25ea403317353d905f\n\n\nrecording to\n\nMP3\n\n\nAll modules, except skype_sync2.exe, are written in Python and packed to\n\nbinary files via the Py2exe tool. This sort of conversion allows Python\n\ncode to be run in a Windows environment without pre-installed Python\n\n\n-----\n\nreverse shell feature. It opens a socket on the victim’s machine and\n\nconnects with a server-side component of the implant located at\n\n54.67.109.199:6500. Before connecting with the socket, it creates a\n\nmalware environment in ‘APPDATA/myupd’ and creates a sqlite3 database\n\nthere – ‘myupd_tmp\\\\mng.db’:\n\n\nCREATE TABLE MANAGE(ID INT PRIMARY KEY NOT\n\nNULL,Send INT NOT NULL, Keylogg INT NOT\n\nNULL,Screenshot INT NOT NULL,Audio INT NOT NULL);\n\nINSERT INTO MANAGE\n\n(ID,Send,Keylogg,Screenshot,Audio) VALUES (1, 1, 1, 1, 0 )\n\n\nFinally, the malware modifies the\n\n‘Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run’ registry key to enable\n\nautostart of the main module.\n\nThe code contains multiple comments in Italian, here is the most\n\nnoteworthy example:\n\n_“Receive commands from the remote server, here you can set the key_\n\n_commands to command the virus”_\n\nHere are the available commands:\n\nName Description\n\nChange current directory to\ncd\n\nspecified\n\nquit Close the socket\n\nExecute received command via\n\n\nnggexe\n\n\nPython’s subprocess.Popen()\n\nwithout outputs\n\n\nUpload specified file to the specified\nngguploads\n\nURL\n\n\nnggdownloads\n\nnggfilesystem\n\n\nDownload content from the\n\nspecified URLs and save to specified\n\nfile\n\nDump file structure of the C: path,\n\nsave it to the file in json format and\n\n\n-----\n\nnggstop_screen When enabled, it makes a\n\nscreenshot every 25 seconds\n\nnggstart_key\n\nEnable/disable keylogging module\nnggstop_key\n\n\nnggstart_rec\n\nnggstop_rec\n\n\nEnable/disable surrounding sounds\n\nrecording module\n\n\nSend components status to the C&C\nngg_status\n\nsocket\n\n\n*any other*\n\n\nExecute received command via\n\nPython’s subprocess.Popen(), output\n\nresult will be sent to the C&C\n\nsocket.\n\n\nAll modules set hidden attributes to their files:\n\nModule Paths Exfiltrated data format\n\n%Y%m%d\n\nmsconf.exe %APPDATA%/myupd/gen/\n\n\n%H%M%S_filesystem.zip (file\n\nstructure dump)\n\n\n%d%m%Y%H%M%S.wav\nsystem.exe %APPDATA%/myupd/aud/\n\n(surrounding sounds)\n\n\n%APPDATA%/myupd_tmp/txt/\nupdate.exe\n\n%APPDATA%/myupd/txt/\n\n\n%Y%m%d-%H%M%S.txt\n\n(keylogging)\n\n\n%Y%m%d-%H%M%S.jpg\nwow.exe %APPDATA%/myupd/scr/\n\n(screenshots)\n\n\n%APPDATA%/myupd_tmp/skype/\nskype_sync2.exe\n\n%APPDATA%/myupd/skype/\n\n\nyyyyMMddHHmmss_in.mp3\n\nyyyyMMddHHmmss_out.mp3\n\n(skype calls records)\n\n\nMoreover, we found one module written in .Net – skype_sync2.exe. The\n\nmain purpose of this module is to exfiltrate Skype call recordings. Just like\n\nthe previous modules, it contains multiple strings in Italian.\n\nAfter launch, it downloads a codec for MP3 encoding directly from the\n\nC&C server:\n\n_http://54.67.109.199/skype_resource/libmp3lame.dll_\n\nThe skype_sync2.exe module has a compilation timestamp – Feb 06 2017\n\nand the following PDB string:\n\n_\\\\vmware-host\\Shared_\n\n_Folders\\dati\\Backup\\Projects\\REcodin_2\\REcodin_2\\obj\\x86\\Release\\REc_\n\n_odin_2.pdb_\n\n\n-----\n\nthe observed version of the implant it doesn’t have an interface to work\n\nwith the skype_sync2.exe module.\n\n_network.exe submitting to the server code snippet_\n\n##### Code similarities\n\nWe found some code similarities between the implant for Windows and\n\nother public accessible projects.\n\nhttps://github.com/El3ct71k/Keylogger/\n\nIt appears the developers have copied the functional part of the keylogger\n\nmodule from this project.\n\n_update.exe module and Keylogger by ‘El3ct71k’ code comparison_\n\n[Xenotix Python Keylogger including specified mutex](https://github.com/ajinabraham/Xenotix-Python-Keylogger/)\n\n\n-----\n\n_update.exe module and Xenotix Python Keylogger code comparison_\n\n_‘addStartup’ method from msconf.exe module_\n\n_‘addStartup’ method from Xenotix Python Keylogger_\n\n## Distribution\n\nWe found several landing pages that spread the Android implants.\n\nMalicious URL Referrer Dates\n\n\nhttp://217.194.13.133/tre/i\n\nnternet/Configuratore_3.a\n\npk\n\nhttp://217.194.13.133/appP\n\nro_AC.apk\n\nhttp://217.194.13.133/190/\n\nconfigurazione/vodafone/\n\nsmartphone/VODAFONE%\n\n20Configuratore%20v5_4\n\n_2.apk\n\nhttp://217.194.13.133/190/\n\nconfigurazione/vodafone/\n\nsmartphone/Vodafone%20\n\nConfiguratore.apk\n\nhttp://vodafoneinfinity.syt\n\nes.net/tim/internet/Config\n\nuratore_TIM.apk\n\nhttp://vodafoneinfinity.syt\n\nes.net/190/configurazione\n\n/vodafone/smartphone/V\n\nODAFONE%20Configurato\n\nre%20v5_4_2.apk\n\nhttp://windupdate.serveft\n\np com/wind/LTE/WIND%2\n\n\nhttp://217.194.13.133/190/\n\nconfigurazione/vodafone/\n\nsmartphone/index.html\n\nhttp://217.194.13.133/190/\n\nconfigurazione/vodafone/\n\nsmartphone/index.html\n\nhttp://vodafoneinfinity.syt\n\nes.net/tim/internet/\n\nhttp://vodafoneinfinity.syt\n\nes.net/190/configurazione\n\n/vodafone/smartphone/\n\nhttp://windupdate.serveft\n\np com/wind/LTE/\n\n\nhttp://217.194.13.133/tre/i\n\nnternet/\n\n\n2015-02-04 to\n\npresent time\n\n\n– 2015-07-01\n\n\n2015-01-20 to\n\npresent time\n\ncurrently active\n\n2015-03-04\n\n2015-01-14\n\n2015-03-31\n\n\n-----\n\n2.apk\n\nhttp://119.network/lte/Inte\n\nrnet-TIM-4G-LTE.apk http://119.network/lte/do\n\n\n2015-02-04\n\n2015-07-20\n\n2015-07-08\n\n\nhttp://119.network/lte/Co\n\nnfiguratore_TIM.apk\n\n\nwnload.html\n\n\nMany of these domains are outdated, but almost all (except one –\n\nappPro_AC.apk) samples located on the 217.194.13.133 server are still\n\naccessible.

As a result of the long-term\n\ndevelopment process, there are multiple, exceptional capabilities: usage\n\nof multiple exploits for gaining root privileges, a complex payload\n\nstructure, never-before-seen surveillance features such as recording\n\nsurrounding audio in specified locations.\n\nGiven the many artifacts we discovered in the malware code, as well as\n\ninfrastructure analysis, we are pretty confident that the developer of the\n\nSkygofree implants is an Italian IT company that works on surveillance\n\nsolutions, just like HackingTeam.\n\n###### Notes\n\n*Skygofree has no connection to Sky, Sky Go or any other subsidiary of\n\nSky, and does not affect the Sky Go service or app.\n\n[Skygofree Appendix — Indicators of Compromise (PDF)](https://cdn.securelist.com/files/2018/01/Skygofree_appendix_eng.pdf)\n\n\n[GOOGLE ANDROID](https://securelist.com/all?tag=34) [HACKING TEAM](https://securelist.com/all?tag=777)\n\n\nShare post on:\n\n####   \n\n\n[MOBILE MALWARE](https://securelist.com/all?tag=76)\n\n\n### Related Posts\n\n\n###### Jack of all trades\n\n\n###### Still Stealing Kaspersky Security Bulletin: Review of the Year 2017\n\n\n-----",
