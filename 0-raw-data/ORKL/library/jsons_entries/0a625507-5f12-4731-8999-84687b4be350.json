Although many people may be vaguely aware\nthat governments and corporations regularly engage in surveillance (indeed, often in collusion) it is\na practice that is difficult to identify and document directly. Not surprisingly, therefore, surveillance\npractices are often the subject of speculation and conspiracy theories. Our lives today are surrounded\nby mediated communications, serviced by third parties and private entities, sent through channels\nthat pass through multiple political jurisdictions, each step of which offers an opportunity for surveillance. Can we rely on the assurances of the service providers and technology companies who tell\nus they are secure and private? Should we trust the assurances of a well-known global brand?\n\nThe findings unearthed and documented by Nart Villeneuve in Breaching Trust suggest that we cannot.\nHere we have a major software tool used to make telephone calls and send instant messages over the\nInternet, advertising secure end-to-end encryption, and widely touted by activists and dissidents as\na safe way to communicate sensitive information, logging sensitive keywords and uploading entire\ntranscripts of conversations to servers in China, which themselves are insecure. How insecure?\nVilleneuve was able to view, download, and archive millions of private communications, ranging from\nbusiness transactions to political correspondence, along with their identifying personal information.\nAlthough some have mooted that Skype is equipped with a backdoor for intelligence, and that\nTOM-Skype in particular contained a Trojan Horse for the Chinese government, the company publicly\ndenied these suspicions. Villeneuve’s research definitively shows these denials are untrue. Although\nVilleneuve’s trail runs cold at the doorstep of eight TOM-Skype servers in China, the underlying purpose of such widespread and systematic surveillance seems obvious. Dissidents and ordinary citizens\nare being systematically monitored and tracked.\n\nWhile there have been other recent revelations of corporate complicity in China’s censorship and\nsurveillance regime – the Yahoo case involving Shi Tao and others comes to mind ­— the facts laid out\nin Breaching Trust are of such massive proportions that these other cases pale in comparison.\n\nThe lessons to be drawn from this case are numerous and issues of corporate social responsibility\nwill be raised. If there was any doubt that your electronic communications – even secure chat – can\nleave a trace, Breaching Trust will put that case to rest. This is a wake up call to everyone who has\never put their (blind) faith in the assurances offered up by network intermediaries like Skype. Declarations and privacy policies are no substitute for the type of due diligence that the research put forth\nhere represents.\n\n**Ron Deibert, Director, the Citizen Lab, Munk Centre for International Studies, University of Toronto.**\n**Rafal Rohozinski, Principal, The SecDev Group, Ottawa, Canada.**\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Major Findings\n\n- **The full text chat messages of TOM-Skype users, along with Skype users who have**\n**communicated with TOM-Skype users, are regularly scanned for sensitive keywords, and**\n**if present, the resulting data are uploaded and stored on servers in China.**\n\n- **These text messages, along with millions of records containing personal information, are**\n**stored on insecure publicly-accessible web servers together with the encryption key required to**\n**decrypt the data.**\n\n- **The captured messages contain specific keywords relating to sensitive political topics such**\n**as Taiwan independence, the Falun Gong, and political opposition to the Communist Party**\n**of China.**\n\n- **Our analysis suggests that the surveillance is not solely keyword-driven. Many of the**\n**captured messages contain words that are too common for extensive logging, suggesting**\n**that there may be criteria, such as specific usernames, that determine whether messages are**\n**captured by the system.**\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Summary\n\nOur investigation reveals troubling security and privacy breaches affecting TOM-Skype—the Chinese\nversion of the popular voice and text chat software Skype, marketed by the domestic Chinese company\nTOM Online. TOM-Skype routinely collects, logs and captures millions of records that include\npersonal information and contact details for any text chat and/or voice calls placed to TOM-Skype\nusers, including those from the Skype platform. These records are kept on publicly-accessible servers,\nalong with the information required to decrypt these log files. These files contain the full text of\nchat messages sent and/or received by TOM-Skype users that contain particular keywords that trigger\nTOM-Skype’s content-filtering capability.\n\nOur investigation revealed eight servers that are part of the TOM-Skype surveillance network. In\naddition, we found one server hosting a special version of TOM-Skype designed for use in “net bars”\nor cybercafés. This server contained log files and information that revealed the list of the words that\nthe system censored. Another server captured data from TOM Online’s wireless services, and\ncontained logs of SMS messages and other sensitive information.\n\nThe log files obtained during the course of the investigation reveal information such as the IP\naddresses, usernames (and land line phone numbers) used to place or receive TOM-Skype calls, as well\nas the full content of filtered messages and the time and date of each message. The collected data affects\nall TOM-Skype users and also captures the personal information of any Skype users that interacted with\nregistered TOM-Skype users. This represents a severe security and privacy breach. It also raises troubling\nquestions regarding how these practices are related to the Government of China’s censorship and\nsurveillance policies. The captured messages contain keywords relating to sensitive topics such as\nTaiwan independence, the Falun Gong, and political opposition to the Communist Party of China.\n\nSecurity problems appear to be endemic at TOM Online. The publicly-accessible servers accessed by\nour investigation are insecure and contain information that can be used to exploit the TOM-Skype\nserver network. It is possible that a malicious attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in the system and\naccess the millions of logged communications and, possibly, detailed user profiles. In fact, evidence\nsuggests that the servers used to store captured data have been compromised in the past and used to\nhost pirated movies and torrents (for peer-to-peer file sharing).[1]\n\nThese findings raise key questions. To what extent do TOM Online and Skype cooperate with the\nChinese government in monitoring the communications of activists and dissidents as well as ordinary\ncitizens? On what legal basis is TOM-Skype capturing and logging this volume and detail of personal\nuser data and communication, and who has access to it?\n\n1 See screen captures in Appendix.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Background\n\nSkype is a popular voice-over-IP software program that lets users make free peer-to-peer phone calls\nover the Internet. In 2004 Skype developed a relationship with TOM Online, a leading wireless provider\nin China, and announced a joint venture in 2005.[2] Skype and TOM Online produced a special version of\nthe Skype software, known as TOM-Skype, for use in China. By 2006 it became clear that TOM-Skype\nwas censoring the text chat feature of its software. It was reported that sensitive words, such as those\nreferring to the banned Falun Gong movement, the Dalai Lama, and the Tiananmen Square incident\ntriggered a filtering mechanism that prevented such messages from being displayed. Human rights\ngroups criticized Skype, suggesting that the company was “legitimizing China’s system of censorship”,[3]\nwhile others suggested that TOM-Skype contained Trojan horse capabilities that could be used for\nsurveillance by the Chinese Government.[4] Skype responded to the criticisms emphatically stating:[5]\n\n- The text filter does not affect in any way the security and encryption mechanisms of Skype.\n\n- Full end-to-end security is preserved and there is no compromise of people’s privacy.\n\n- Calls, chats and all other forms of communication on Skype continue to be encrypted and secure.\n\n- There is absolutely no filtering on voice communications.\n\nWhile Skype specifically stated that censored messages are “simply discarded and not displayed or\ntransmitted anywhere” [6], this report demonstrates that not only are filtered messages transmitted to\nand stored on TOM-Skype servers located in China, but also that the servers themselves are configured\nwith such poor security that it is possible to retrieve and decrypt these logs.\n\n2 http://about.skype.com/2005/09/tom_online_skype_announce_join.html\n\n3 http://www.hrw.org/reports/2006/china0806/5.htm#_Toc142395828\n\n4 http://en.epochtimes.com/news/7-9-29/60228.html\n\n5 http://share.skype.com/sites/en/2006/04/comments_about_skype_chat_text.html\n\n6 http://share.skype.com/sites/en/2006/04/comments_about_skype_chat_text.html\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Censorship: How Does it Work?\n\nThe TOM-Skype software from skype.tom.com contains a keyfile that appears to be an encrypted list\nof banned keywords as well as a filtering component created by TOM Online. When a TOM-Skype user\nsends or receives a text chat message that contains a keyword, the message is not displayed.\nHowever, when such a message is sent or received by a TOM-Skype user an HTTP connection is made\nto a TOM-Skype server and encrypted data is uploaded. These messages are stored in log files on the\nTOM-Skype servers.\n\n#### Security and Privacy\n\nTOM-Skype maintains eight servers to which data is uploaded from the TOM-Skype client software.\nMuch of the interaction between the client and the servers focuses on product features, such as\nletting the user’s contacts know when he or she is online, storing text messages that users send to\ncontacts that are not currently online, and displaying advertisements to the user. However, there are\na variety of different log files that contain stored personal information:\n\n- **contentfilter*.log - ip, username, message, date, time (+ unknown parameters)**\n\n- **skypecallinfo*.log - ip, username, version, username/phone number, date, time (+ unknown parameters)**\n\n- **skypelogininfo*.log – ip, version, username, date, time**\n\n- **skypenewuser*.log – ip, version, username, date, time**\n\n- **skypenewusersendmoneytest*.log - unable to decrypt**\n\n- **skypeonlineinfo*.log – ip, username, version date, time (+ unknown parameters)**\n\n- **skypeversion.log – version, ip, date, time (not encrypted)**\n\nThese log files contain information such as the IP addresses and usernames as well as the date and\ntime when the entry in the log was recorded. The most damaging information concerns the log files\nthat record call information and the content filter logs that contain full text chat messages. The call\ninformation logs date from August 2007 and contain a record of the IP addresses and usernames of all\nthose that participated in voice calls as well as the username and/or phone number of the recipient\nof the call. There are additional parameters that are logged whose function is unknown at this time.\nThe content filter logs dating from August 2008 contain similar identifying information as well as\nthe full content of the logged text messages. These messages contain sensitive information including\nemail addresses, passwords, phone numbers, package tracking numbers and bank card numbers.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Censorship and Surveillance\n\nWe analyzed the content filter log files containing censored messages from August and September\n2008. These log files, spread across eight servers, contained 1,045,800 messages. However, there is\nsome duplication across the eight servers and users often send the same message several times after\nit is censored because it fails to be displayed.\n\nThe log files for the content filter contain the full content of censored messages along with the IP\naddress of the TOM-Skype user, the username that sent the message and the date and time the\nmessage was sent. If a TOM-Skype user is sent a message by a “normal” Skype user that contains a\nbanned keyword, that message is also logged and the Skype user’s username is logged along with the\nIP address of the intended recipient.\n\nIt is possible to map the social network of each user that appears in the log files. We cannot prove\nthat this data is actively being used for politically motivated surveillance but with simple social\nnetworking tools it is possible to identify the relationships between users. With just one username it\nis possible to identify all the users that have sent messages to or received messages from the original\nuser. More complex mapping could track the relationships between all those users as well.\n\nThe example below shows the social network map of user “1” (the green circle) and is based on\nmessages from the content filter logs. The red circles represent unique IP addresses that are associated\nwith user “1” and the blue circles represent other user names that are associated with these IP\naddresses. All these “blue” users have had some form of connection with user “1” and all have had\ntheir messages logged by TOM-Skype. The form of the connection between each user is unclear. In\nsome cases the “blue” users may represent user “1” employing a different username. In other cases it\nmay represent users that received messages from or sent messages to user “1” in either a one-to-one\nconversation or in a public chat.\n\n\n-----\n\nMessages were logged from IP addresses allocated to 59 different countries. However, 95% of all the\nlogged messages were from IP addresses allocated to China; the U.S. followed with 0.78%. The reason\nthat this percentage is so high is because when a user—a normal Skype user for example—sends a\nmessage to a TOM-Skype user that contains a keyword, the message is logged with the username of\nthe sender but the IP address of the receiver. The non-Chinese IP addresses appear to represent\nTOM-Skype users in other countries.\n\nIn total, these log files contain 166,766 unique messages from 71,237 unique IP addresses and 44,254\nunique usernames. The messages were processed to remove messages containing English language\nobscenities leaving 102,196 (61%) messages, mostly in Chinese. While some pornographic and\nobscenity-laden messages remain, the majority appear to be a combination of innocuous messages\ncaptured by overzealous filtering, and messages containing keywords relating to sensitive topics such\nas Taiwan independence, the Falun Gong, and political opposition to the Communist Party of China.\n\nOf the 96,499 messages that were successfully translated with machine translation, 15,156 messages\n(15.71%) contain the word “communist”, 6,744 contained “Falun” (6.99%) and 2,363 (2.45%)\ncontained “Taiwan Independence.”[7]\n\n7 The keyword matching was done in English against machine-translated messages. These numbers serve as an indicator of the type of\ncontent. They do not reflect the content of the conversation (for or against the topic). Processing the messages using Chinese\ncharacters would provide a much more accurate data set.\n\n\n-----\n\nHowever, when we pasted politically sensitive keywords from the log files into TOM-Skype text\nmessages, we were unable to trigger the filtering or the uploading of the data to TOM-Skype servers.\nThis is consistent with the findings of Human Rights Watch from 2006.[8] Despite Skype’s claim that\nkeywords concerning Taiwan, the Dalai Lama and Falung Gong were censored, Human Rights Watch\nwas able to send and receive messages containing such keywords.\n\nIt is possible that the filtering of politically sensitive keywords is restricted in some way, perhaps\ngeographically. However, it may also indicate that TOM-Skype is performing surveillance: logging\nmessages containing keywords but continuing to display the messages to users. Based on an analysis\nof the messages in the content filter logs it is clear that messages containing such keywords are\nbeing delivered to users, as many of the messages appear to be questions and responses. A conversation\nis taking place and it is being logged.\n\nFor example, questions appear, such as:\n\n你喜欢共产党？\n\n(Do you like the Communist Party? [machine translation])\n\nAnd responses that appear to be answers:\n\n我不恨共产党也不喜欢国民党\n\n(I do not hate the Communist Party do not like the KMT [machine translation])\n\nMany of the politically sensitive messages logged by TOM-Skype make reference to the The Epoch\n_Times and Falun Gong linked campaign that encourages Chinese citizens to quit the Chinese Com-_\nmunist Party (CCP). In 2005 the “Global Service Center for Quitting the CCP” was set up to encourage\nChinese citizens to quit the CCP.[9] This campaign uses “[t]elephone, mobile phone text messages, chatting online” to contact Chinese citizens and provide them with information that is critical of the CCP\nand highlights the persecution of the Falun Gong.[10] This campaign has made extensive use of Skype\nincluding Skype “public chats” and SkypeCast.[11]\n\nSkype has become a popular communication tool among democracy activists in mainland China in recent years.\nDue to its excellent vocal clarity, fewer imposed restrictions, and an end-to-end encryption feature making it\ndifficult to monitor, many Chinese democracy activists have favored Skype over traditional telephones and other\nsimilar communication tools.[12]\n\n8 http://www.hrw.org/reports/2006/china0806/5.htm#_Toc142395828\n\n9 http://en.epochtimes.com/news/8-1-4/63609.html\n\n10 http://en.epochtimes.com/news/7-12-29/63377.html and http://en.epochtimes.com/news/8-7-3/72847.html\n\n11 http://en.epochtimes.com/n2/china/skype-shutdown-chat-room-dissappointing-chinese-3788.html\n\n12 http://en.epochtimes.com/news/7-9-29/60228.html, see also http://en.epochtimes.com/news/8-1-19/64311.html\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile the campaign uses Skype extensively, they also warn users of the filtering capabilities of the\nChinese version distributed by TOM-Skype.[13] However, many users contacted by members of the campaign are using TOM-Skype, resulting in numerous logged text chat messages on TOM-Skype servers\nin China. In fact, they are quite open about exactly who they are and what they are doing. Thus it is\ntrivial to identify users associated with the campaign.\n\n我是全球退党服务中心的义工\n(I am a global service centre for volunteers to quit the party [machine translation])\n\nWithout further testing we are unable to conclusively determine that the objective is surveillance\nrather than filtering. However, we do know that regardless of the process the full messages are being\nlogged and could be used for surveillance. Moreover, many of these messages contain words that are\ntoo common for extensive logging, suggesting that there may be criteria, such as usernames or who\none has chatted with, or particular public chats, that determine how fine-grain the logging should\nbe. For example, messages were logged that consisted entirely of “123”, “谢谢” (Thank You [machine\ntranslation]), and just a text smiley face “:).” The fact that messages such as these are being logged\nsuggests that at least some of the logging is focused on criteria other than just general keywords.\n\n13 http://tuidang.net/news/contents.php?aID=2270\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nThe questionable security practices of TOM-Online led to the disclosure of millions of records containing personal information regarding mobile phone accounts, SMS messages, and the usage of TOMSkype. However, this disclosure also confirms that TOM-Skype is censoring and logging text chat\nmessages that contain specific, sensitive keywords and may be engaged in more targeted surveillance.\nThese logged messages contain keywords relating to sensitive topics such as Taiwan independence,\nthe Falun Gong, and political opposition to the Communist Party of China. Many of these messages\ncontain words that are too common for extensive logging, suggesting that there may be targeted\nsurveillance taking place.\n\nThis case provides a unique perspective on the battle over information taking place between authoritarian governments and political activists through the medium of new technologies. While new\ntechnologies provide an innovative platform for political activists to communicate globally, they also\nprovide governments with the ability to monitor and track political opponents and human rights\nadvocates. The logging of these messages by TOM-Skype reveals the efforts to combat the use of\nSkype by political activists through censoring and logging messages that contain politically sensitive\nkeywords. While the extent of targeted surveillance by TOM-Skype is not known for certain, many of\nthe logged messages are specific to the “Quit the CCP” campaign. These messages reveal many of\nthe methods used by the campaign including the promotion of circumvention technology and\npseudonymous email addresses.\n\nThese findings should serve as a warning for groups engaging in political activism or promoting the\nuse of censorship circumvention technology accessed through services provided by companies that\nhave compromised on human rights. Private and politically sensitive messages sent through new\ncommunications technologies are only as secure as the robustness of the security of the technology\ncompanies themselves. In this case we were able to access volumes of sensitive data without the\ncooperation of the company involved due to lax security. There is no reason why an inquisitive\ngovernment could not do the same.\n\nTrust in a well-known brand such as Skype is an insufficient guarantee when it comes to censorship\nand surveillance. This case demonstrates the critical importance of the issues of transparency and\naccountability by providers of communications technologies. It highlights the risks of storing personally identifying and sensitive private information in jurisdictions where human rights and privacy are\nunder threat. It also illustrates the need to assess the security, privacy and human rights impact of\nsuch a decision.\n\nConsistent with most major companies that have acquiesced to China’s censorship and surveillance\npolicies, Skype is not transparent or forthcoming about the exact nature of their compliance with\nChinese authorities. To what extent is Skype actively complicit in the censorship and surveillance\nof political discourse in China? What policies, if any, are in place to protect the privacy and human\nrights of Chinese Skype users? What is clear is that TOM-Skype is engaging in extensive surveillance\nwith seemingly little regard for the security and privacy of Skype users. This is in direct contradiction\nof Skype’s public statements regarding their policies in China.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe fight for the future of freedom of expression is underway and new technologies are the battleground upon which this information war will be waged. It is becoming increasingly clear that companies must be direct and transparent regarding their policies of censorship and surveillance. Failure\nin this regard leads to little if any internal oversight within the company and, possibly, to severe\nbreaches of privacy and security that affect the global reputation of the company itself.[14] More\nimportantly, it puts real people at risk and exacerbates the potential for human rights abuses.\n\n14 For a detailed analysis of trust and reputation and the case of Yahoo!, see http://rconversation.blogs.com/YahooShiTaoLessons.pdf\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Appendix\n\nTom-Skype v. 3.8.4.44\nDownload: http://download.skype.tom.com/Tom-SkypeSetup.exe\n\nAfter downloading TOM-Skype, the Wireshark packet sniffer was used to monitor all the traffic generated by TOM-Skype during the installation and user registration process as well as while text chatting\nwith both Skype and TOM-Skype users. An analysis of the packet dumps revealed that every time\nthe keyword “fuck” was entered into the TOM-Skype Chat (or sent from a Skype user to a TOM-Skype\nuser) a connection was made to a URL with encrypted data being uploaded.\n\nVisiting the directory structure of the URL directly revealed the contents of each of the parent directories.\nWe were able to find eight such servers. On each server, the log files were listed in the directories and\nwere viewable. Browsing through the directory structure revealed the encryption key used to encrypt\nmost of the log files, including the content filter logs. There were a variety of log files:\n\n- **contentfilter*.log - ip, username, message, date, time (+ unknown parameters)**\n\n- **skypecallinfo*.log - ip, username, version, username/phone number, date, time (+ unknown**\nparameters)\n\n- **skypelogininfo*.log – ip, version, username, date, time**\n\n- **skypenewuser*.log – ip, version, username, date, time**\n\n- **skypenewusersendmoneytest*.log - unable to decrypt**\n\n- **skypeonlineinfo*.log – ip, username, version date, time (+ unknown parameters)**\n\n- **skypeversion.log – version, ip, date, time (not encrypted)**\n\nThese log files contain information such as the IP addresses and usernames as well as the date and\ntime when the entry in the log was recorded. The most damaging information concerns the log files\nthat record call information and the content filter logs that contain full text messages. The call information logs date from August 2007 and contain a record of the IP addresses and usernames of all\nthose that initiated voice calls as well as the username and/or phone number of the recipient of the\ncall. There are additional parameters that are logged whose function is unknown at this time.\n\nThe content filter logs dating from August 2008 contain similar identifying information as well as the\nfull content of the logged text messages. The messages in the content filter log files from all eight\nservers were decrypted using the key available on the servers. The messages were then processed to\nremove duplicates and all unique usernames and IP addresses were extracted. We also mapped all the\nusernames associated with unique IP addresses as this indicates a network of users that have had\nsome form of contact with one another. We were then able to extract all the messages of the user\nwithin this network.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe further processed the file to remove messages containing the string “fuck”. The remaining\nmessages, mostly in Chinese, were machine-translated. Queries were run against this set of messages\nto look for politically sensitive words such as “Communist Party” and “Taiwan Independence” as\nwell as security-sensitive words such as “password”, “bank”, and “credit card.” The logs were parsed\nand messages containing particular keywords were counted and flagged for analysis. The qualitative\nanalysis of what is contained within these logs was conducted based on these queries:\n\n**communist**\n**Communist Party**\n**Falun**\n**Hu Jintao**\n**Taiwan independence**\n**Skype**\n**Wen Jiabao**\n**quit the party**\n**Jiang Zemin**\n**June 4**\n**Olympic Games**\n**Nine Commentaries**\n**Li Hongzhi**\n**earthquake**\n**democracy**\n**Tibet**\n**Mao Zedong**\n**Circumvention***\n**Deng Xiaoping**\n**Diaoyu Islands**\n**Kuomintang**\n**Tiananmen**\n**milk powder**\n**SARS**\n**Voice of America**\n\n- (a group of the following keywords: free door, filter, anti-blockade browser, Garden Network)\n\n\n-----\n\nScreen shots of Google search results showing that TOM-Skype servers had been previously used for\nfile sharing and torrent hosting.\n\n\n-----",
