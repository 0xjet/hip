We named the attack \"BITTER\" based on the network communication\nheader used by the latest variant of remote access tool (RAT) used:\n\nOur investigation indicates that the campaign has existed since at least November 2013 but\nhas remained active until today. This post intends to share the results of our research.\n\n## Infection Vector\n\nSpear-phishing emails are used to target prospective BITTER victims. The campaign\n[predominantly used the older, relatively popular Microsoft Office exploit, CVE-2012-0158, in](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2012-0158)\norder to download and execute a RAT binary from a website. Below is an example of a\nspear-phishing email they used earlier this month. The recipient is an individual from a\ngovernment branch in Pakistan, while the sender purports to be coming from another\ngovernment branch of Pakistan:\n\n\n-----\n\nOther attachment filenames they used that also contained the CVE-2012-0158 exploit are as\nfollows:\n\n_Requirement List.doc_\n\n_Cyber Espionage Prevention.doc_\n\n_New email guidelines.doc_\n\n_Gazala-ke-haseen-nagme.doc_\n\n_Rules.xls_\n\nIn one instance, they used a RAR SFX dropper that drops both their RAT and a picture of a\nPakistani woman as a decoy. A quick Google image search on the dropped picture indicates\nthat the picture was grabbed from Pakistani dating sites.\n\n## RAT Component\n\nBITTER used RATs that are compiled using Microsoft Visual C++ 8.0. They use a\nfew iterations of their RAT with the main difference being the RAT's command and control\n(C2) communication method. Earlier variants communicated to its C2 via an unencrypted\nHTTP POST. Below is an example of an older variant's phone home request:\n\n\n-----\n\nNewer ones, on the other hand, use encrypted TCP connection such as the one shown in\nthe introduction above. Both older and newer variants are used simultaneously today in the\ncampaign.\n\nThe RAT version (SHA1 d7a770233848f42c5e1d5f4b88472f7cb12d5f3d) that they used in\ntheir latest campaign is capable of executing the following backdoor capabilities, essentially\nallowing the attackers to gain full remote control over a victim's PC:\n\nGet system information - computer name, current user name, and operating system\n\nEnumerate logical drives\n\nEnumerate and log files and their corresponding timestamps\n\nOpen a remote command shell\n\nList processes with active UDP connections\n\nManipulate running processes\n\nManipulate files\n\nDownload a file\n\nIn addition, the vast majority of their RAT binaries contained the following digital signature\nwith a non-trusted CA Root certificate:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe following table shows the timeline of appearance of BITTER RATs, based on their\ncompilation timestamps, along with their embedded PDB paths:\n\n\n-----\n\nIt is important to note that some of these RATs are distributed at a later time than their\ncompilation date.\n\n## Command and Control\n\nBITTER used free dynamic DNS (DDNS) and dedicated server hosting services in order to\nset up their C2s. The download site where the exploit documents download the RAT binaries\nare, in most cases, different from the actual RAT C2. However, both of them are typically\nregistered using a Gmail email address and a spoofed identity purporting to be either from\nUnited Kingdom or Great Britain. Below is an example of a spoofed registrant information for\nthe C2, spiralbook71[.]com:\n\nA list of all related malicious domains we managed to collect are as follows:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe email address witribehelp@gmail.com points to an empty Google Plus profile with the\nname \"WhatsApp Support\". Interestingly, however, the account is connected to another\nGoogle Plus account with the handle \"Love Pakistan\":\n\n\n-----\n\n## Intent\n\nWhile cyber-espionage is a common motivation for targeted attacks, this is often hard to\nconclude unless a forensic investigation is conducted on the actual victims' machines. In\nsome cases, specific capabilities in RATs provides us with clues on what the attackers' true\nintents are.\n\nOne of the backdoor capabilities mentioned above is the logging of files and files' time\nstamps from the victim's machine. Furthermore, an older variant of their RAT from 2014 that\nhas the SHA1 3ab4ce4b3a44c96d6c454efcece774b33335dda2 are found to look for more\nspecific file types. After identifying the logical drives from a victim PC, this RAT variant\nproceeds to enumerate files and check if they match any of the hard coded document and\narchive file extensions below:\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile it is hard to conclude based only on these artifacts, the nature of these targeted file\ntypes suggests that the attackers may be after sensitive documents.\n\n## Other Tools Used\n\nIn December 2015 one of the campaign's download sites hosted a binary\nat scholars90[.]website/putty. The downloaded file is a free SSH and Telnet client\napplication called \"PuTTY\", which has been used in the past in other targeted attacks.\n\nIn addition, the same RAT variant previously\nmentioned (SHA1 3ab4ce4b3a44c96d6c454efcece774b33335dda2) connects to the\nC2 info2t[.]com/m2s.php . This has also served as a C2 for at least two AndroRAT variants\nin the past. The following diagram shows these relationships:\n\n\n-----\n\nAndroRAT is an open source remote administration tool for Android. Its GitHub repository\nlists the following capabilities:\n\nGet contacts (and all theirs informations)\n\nGet call logs\n\nGet all messages\n\nLocation by GPS/Network\n\nMonitoring received messages in live\n\nMonitoring phone state in live (call received, call sent, call missed..)\n\nTake a picture from the camera\n\nStream sound from microphone (or other sources..)\n\nStreaming video (for activity based client only)\n\nDo a toast\n\nSend a text message\n\n\n-----\n\nGive call\n\nOpen an URL in the default browser\n\nDo vibrate the phone\n\nThe AndroRAT variant with SHA1 7d47ae3114f08ecf7fb473b7f5571d70cf2556da disguises\nitself as the Islam Adhan Alarm - an Android app that alerts to prayer times of Islam, which\nis the state religion of Pakistan. The variant with SHA1\n_645a6e53116f1fd7ece91549172480c0c78df0f, on the other hand, disguises itself_\nas Kashmir News app. Kashmir is the northernmost geographical region of South Asia and\nis a disputed territory between India and Pakistan.\n\n## Protection Statement\n\nStage 2 (Lure) - Spear-phishing e-mails associated with this attack are identified and\nblocked.\n\nStage 5 (Dropper File) - Related RATs are prevented from being downloaded.\n\nStage 6 (Call Home) - Communication between the RAT and command and control are\nblocked.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nMany targeted attacks continue to be discovered today. It is interesting to see that while\nthese attacks are not always sophisticated in nature, the same characteristic allows them to\nstay under the radar by blending in with common attacks in the wild. BITTER is able to\nachieve this by using available online services such as free DDNS, dedicated server hosting\nand Gmail to setup their C2s. Such setup is exhibited by today's common malware.\n\nIt is worth noting that in all the artifacts collected in this research, none of the English words\nthat were used had spelling errors, suggesting that the actors behind BITTER are proficient\nin the English language. Furthermore, as discussed above, all the artifacts we have seen are\nconsistent with Pakistan being the target of this group. There may be other targets that have\nnot been discovered yet or BITTER may be a branch of a larger campaign with broader\ntargets, but only time will tell whether any of these are correct.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n### RAT (SHA1)\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n42cdfe465ed996c546c215a8e994a82fea7dc24c\n3ab4ce4b3a44c96d6c454efcece774b33335dda2\n1990fa48702c52688ce6da05b714a1b3e634db76\n93e98e9c4cf7964ea4e7a559cdd2720afb26f7f7\nc3a39dc22991fcf2455b8b6b479eda3009d6d0fd\n37e59c1b32684cedb341584387ab75990749bde7\n52485ae219d64daad6380abdc5f48678d2fbdb54\n137a7dc1c33dc04e4f00714c074f35c520f7bb97\ne57c88b302d39f4b1da33c6b781557fed5b8cece\n0172526faf5d0c72122febd2fb96e2a01ef0eff8\ne7e0ba30878de73597a51637f52e20dc94ae671d\nfa8c800224786bab5a436b46acd2c223edda230e\nc75b46b50b78e25e09485556acd2e9862dce3890\n72fa5250069639b6ac4f3477b85f59a24c603723\nf898794563fa2ae31218e0bb8670e08b246979c9\n2b873878b4cfbe0aeab32aff8890b2e6ceed1804\nd7a770233848f42c5e1d5f4b88472f7cb12d5f3d\nddf5bb366c810e4d524833dcd219599380c86e7a\n23b28275887c7757fa1d024df3bd7484753bba37\n6caae6853d88fc35cc150e1793fef5420ff311c6\n1a2ec73fa90d800056516a8bdb0cc4da76f82ade\nff73d3c649703f11d095bb92c956fe52c1bf5589\n\n### RAT Dropper (SHA1)\nc0fcf4fcfd024467aed379b07166f2f7c86c3200\n0116b053d8ed6d864f83351f306876c47ad1e227\n4be6e7e7fb651c51181949cc1a2d20f61708371a\n998d401edba7a9509546511981f8cd4bff5bc098\n21ef1f7df01a568014a92c1f8b41c33d7b62cb40\nc77b8de689caee312a29d30094be72b18eca778d\n\n AndroRAT (SHA1)\n7d47ae3114f08ecf7fb473b7f5571d70cf2556da\n645a6e53116f1fd7ece91549172480c0c78df0f\n\n RAT download sites\nkart90.website/sysdll \nrange7.com/svcf.exe\nscholars90.website/ifxc\nscholars90.website/ifxc\nscholars90.website/cnhost.exe\nkart90.website/cnhost\nfrontier89.website/wmiserve\nreloadguide71.com/winter/iofs\ncreed90.com/ismr\nwester.website/uwe\nchinatel90.com/min\nwester.website/nqw\nscholars90.website/splsrv\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n### RAT C2s\n```\nranadey.net78.net/Muzic/exist.php\ninfo2t.com\nrange7.com/m2s_reply_u2.php\nwww.queryz4u.com\nwww.sportszone71.com/games/hill.php\nmicronet.no-ip.co.uk\nwww.inspire71.com/warzone/hill.php\nspiralbook71.com/warzone/hill.php\ngovsite.ddns.net\nrandomvalue90.com/warzone/hill.php\nmarvel89.com/ahead.php\ncloudupdates.servehttp.com\npickup.ddns.net\nmarvel89.com/msuds.php\nupdateservice.redirectme.net\npickup.ddns.net\ndestiny91.com/truen/adfsdsqw.php\nmedzone71.com/medal/adfsdsqw.php\nnexster91.com/winter/war.php\n\n About Forcepoint\n\n```\nForcepoint is the leading user and data protection cybersecurity company, entrusted to\nsafeguard organizations while driving digital transformation and growth.
