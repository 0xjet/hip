See a recent blog by CrowdStrike for more information.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/owassrf-exploit-analysis-and-recommendations/)\nMicrosoft disclosed CVE-2022-41080 as a privilege escalation vulnerability and did not\ninclude notes for being part of a Remote Code Execution chain that was exploitable,\" Karen\nO'Reilly-Smith, Rackspace's Chief Security Officer, told BleepingComputer.\n\n\"We thank CrowdStrike for their thorough work in discovering this zero-day exploit during\nthe course of this investigation and will be sharing more detailed information with our\ncustomers and peers in the security community so that, collectively, we can all better defend\nagainst these types of exploits in the future.\"\n\nSince the attack was discovered, Rackspace has provided customers free licenses to\nmigrate their email from its Hosted Exchange platform to Microsoft 365.\n\nThe company is also working on providing affected users' with download links to their\nmailboxes (containing Hosted Exchange email data before December 2) through its\ncustomer portal via an automated queue.\n\n\"We are proactively notifying customers for whom we have recovered greater than 50% of\n[their mailboxes,\" the company said on the incident report page.](https://status.apps.rackspace.com/index/viewincidents?group=2)\n\n\"We are still working meticulously to upload the remaining data into the portal. Once\navailable for download, the PST files will be available through the customer portal for 30\ndays.\"\n\n## Defend Exchange servers against Play ransomware attacks\n\nCrowdStrike said the OWASSRF exploit was used to drop remote access tools such as\nPlink and AnyDesk on Rackspace-compromised servers.\n\nBleepingComputer also found that Play ransomware tooling found online by researchers\nalso contains the ConnectWise remote administration software, which will likely be\ndeployed in attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\nAll organizations with on-premises Microsoft Exchange servers on their network are advised\nto apply the latest Exchange security updates immediately (with November 2022 being the\nminimum patch level) or disable Outlook Web Access (OWA) until they can apply patches\nfor CVE-2022-41080.\n\n[The Play ransomware operation was first spotted in June 2022, after the first victims began](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/play/)\n[reaching out for help in the BleepingComputer forums.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/t/773651/play-ransomware-play-support-topic/)\n\nSince its launch, dozens of victims have uploaded ransom notes and samples to the ID\nRansomware platform to identify what ransomware was used to encrypt their files.\n\n_Play ransomware activity (ID Ransomware)_\nUnlike most ransomware operations, Play gang affiliates use email as a negotiation channel\nand will not provide victims with a link to a Tor negotiations page within ransom notes\ndropped on encrypted systems.\n\nHowever, they are stealing data from their victims' networks before deploying ransomware\npayloads and will threaten to leak it online if the ransom is not paid.\n\n[Recent Play ransomware victims include the German H-Hotels hotel chain,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/play-ransomware-claims-attack-on-german-hotel-chain-h-hotels/) Argentina's\nJudiciary of Córdoba, and the [Belgium city of Antwerp.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/play-ransomware-claims-attack-on-belgium-city-of-antwerp/)\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[CISA orders agencies to patch Exchange bug abused by ransomware gang](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cisa-orders-agencies-to-patch-exchange-bug-abused-by-ransomware-gang/)\n\n[Microsoft: Cuba ransomware hacking Exchange servers via OWASSRF flaw](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-cuba-ransomware-hacking-exchange-servers-via-owassrf-flaw/)\n\n[Ransomware gang uses new Microsoft Exchange exploit to breach servers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-gang-uses-new-microsoft-exchange-exploit-to-breach-servers/)\n\n[The Week in Ransomware - December 23rd 2022 - Targeting Microsoft Exchange](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-week-in-ransomware-december-23rd-2022-targeting-microsoft-exchange/)\n\n[The Week in Ransomware - January 13th 2023 - LockBit in the spotlight](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-week-in-ransomware-january-13th-2023-lockbit-in-the-spotlight/)\n\n[Microsoft Exchange](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/microsoft-exchange/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[OWASSRF](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/owassrf/)\n[PLAY](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/play/)\n[Rackspace](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/rackspace/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n\n[Sergiu Gatlan](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/sergiu-gatlan/)\n\nSergiu Gatlan has covered cybersecurity, technology, and a few other topics for over a\ndecade.
