Its devastating impact paralysed shipping company Maersk, pharmaceutical company Merck, and French construction company Saint- Gobain.\n\nAt Maersk, a finance executive in Ukraine had asked an IT administrator to install the\naccounting software on a single computer in an office in Odessa, a port city on Ukraine’s\nBlack Sea coast. That gave the malware the foothold it needed to spread beyond Ukraine,\ndisabling ports and shipping operations at Maersk globally. IT engineers worked tirelessly to\nrecover servers, systems, data and applications.\n\n\n-----\n\nAccording to a White House assessment, the attack caused more than $10 billion of global\ndamages.\n\nIn the full article published on Wired.com, journalist Andy Greenberg writes: “Almost\neveryone who studied NotPetya agrees on one point: that it could happen again or even\nreoccur on a larger scale.”\n\nNotPetya has proven to the world that distance is no defence in cyberspace. With\ngeopolitical tensions rising, this captivating story of NotPetya is a stark reminder of the ripple\neffects a nation-state attack has on companies.\n\n## Why does this matter for businesses?\n\nNotPetya is a story of nation-state cyber weapons, geopolitical tensions, and\nunsuspecting companies caught in the crossfire, suffering collateral damage.\nThe story of NotPetya could be instructive for the current geopolitical tension between\nUkraine and Russia.\nNotPetya highlights the need not only for cybersecurity protection within enterprises\nand across their supply chains. It also highlights the need for resilience.\n\n[Read the full article (behind paywall)](https://www.wired.com/story/notpetya-cyberattack-ukraine-russia-code-crashed-the-world/)\n\n\n-----",
