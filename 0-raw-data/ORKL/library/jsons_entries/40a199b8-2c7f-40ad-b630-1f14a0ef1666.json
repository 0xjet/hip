Actors across the spectrum are\nusing tools like command-and-control (C2) frameworks, anonymization networks, remote monitoring\nand management software, and legitimate internet service proxies as a matter of course. We\nspecifically note trends in Russian and Chinese state-sponsored malicious infrastructure, where the use\nof anonymization networks and legitimate internet services is increasing. Since such tools allow\nmalicious activity to blend in and make attribution more difficult, we suggest network defenders\nexamine and improve their capabilities in detecting and stopping attacks.\n\nThe top offensive security tools observed this year include Cobalt Strike, Viper, and Meterpreter.\nRemote access tools (RATs) topping the list this year are AsyncRAT, QuasarRAT, PlugX, ShadowPad,\nand DarkComet.\n\nWe share this information for others to consider when evaluating their own threat models, to allow other\nresearchers to corroborate their data, and to assist the community in seeing a better overall picture of\nthe state of malicious infrastructure for 2023. We believe that this information can help guide updates\nto risk assessments, drive security control decisions, and lead to a better understanding of the overall\ncyber threat landscape.\n\nWe foresee the continuing use of government takedowns of malicious infrastructure, with varying\ndegrees of impact. These actions do make criminal operations more difficult and are worth undertaking.\nWe also believe that there will be increasing adoption of legitimate internet services, anonymization\nproxies, and other tools that allow attackers to blend into the victim’s environment and make attribution\ndifficult. We also expect to see a steady adoption of artificial intelligence by a variety of threat actors to\nbetter automate their operations and increase efficiency in other ways.\n\nCountering some of these threats may entail difficult decisions. For example, organizations concerned\nabout the use of legitimate internet services as malicious infrastructure should minimally create a\nbaseline of the services seen on their network and tune their current security controls to the extent\npossible. More advanced security measures, such as decrypting and monitoring TLS traffic, may be\nrequired to truly combat this threat, but organizations must also consider the privacy implications, costs\nof implementation, and potential impacts on network systems and productivity.\n\n## Key Findings\n\n  - Open-source and commodity malware C2s continue to lead the way in terms of infrastructure\nserver numbers.\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\n- Despite many contenders for the title, Cobalt Strike remains the top C2 framework by a wide\nmargin.\n\n- RedLine Stealer and Raccoon Stealer are the clear leaders among infostealer C2s in 2023 as far\nas the volume of C2 servers, despite a hiatus of several months for Raccoon Stealer.\n\n- Takedowns of malicious infrastructure, such as the recent dissolution of the QakBot network, are\neffective ways of adding friction to malicious operations.\n\n- Russian state-sponsored actors are continuing to add legitimate internet services to their\nrepertoire. They also update their C2 infrastructure with a rapid cadence, making changes\nweekly or even daily.\n\n- China state-sponsored actors are increasingly using anonymization networks constructed of\ncompromised IoT systems, routers, and other devices. Multiple China-affiliated entities have\nbeen observed sharing the use of these networks.\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\n## Background\n\nOne of Recorded Future's key responsibilities involves promptly identifying and sharing information\nabout newly established malicious servers by creating detections for malicious infrastructure. Detecting\nmalicious infrastructure enables security operations teams to promptly alert, block, and address\npotential threats, ultimately thwarting successful attacks. However, there are other benefits: we can use\nthis data to learn more about the attackers and their methods, estimate the number of attacks for\ncampaigns, discover changes in the infrastructure as they happen, and even investigate connections\nbetween the malicious network nodes and potential victims.\n\nBased on the data we collect, we can compare our known knowledge of malicious infrastructure with\npublic intrusions related to those malware families and assess how many events remain unknown in the\npublic domain. We can also measure the tempo of server creation, which may provide insight into future\nactivity levels.\n\nAnother outcome of our infrastructure detection work is the ability to look into trends and\ncommonalities generally — this report is a product of that and shares data, trends, and insights from\nour malicious infrastructure research in 2023.\n\nThere are typically multiple steps required before a malicious server can become operational. The\nfollowing graphic shows what we call the C2 weaponization lifecycle (see Figure 1). Establishing a\nmalicious server requires the following 5 steps, in order:\n\n  - Acquiring the domain, IP address, and actual server\n\n  - Installing whatever software is needed for the server to interact with other nodes\n\n  - Provisioning of TLS certificates or other features\n\n  - Establishing remote access for the controlling actor\n\n  - Setting the system to be fully operational\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 1: C2 weaponization lifecycle (Source: Recorded Future)**\n\nAt any step of this process, traces and artifacts that tie that system to others like it or the same\noperator may be discovered and used to create detections.\n\nOur research aims to minimize the time delay between the establishment of malicious infrastructure and\nits identification and tagging as such. Shortening this interval helps network defenders neutralize\npotential threats more proactively. By focusing on detectable features and artifacts on malicious\nsystems, we can discover new ones hours, days, or even weeks before they become actively\nweaponized, giving our customers a significant advantage over alerting only on historically active\nindicators of compromise (IoCs).\n\nRecorded Future tracks malicious infrastructure, including offensive security tools, C2 frameworks,\ncommodity malware, custom malware, botnets, and more. In 2023 we discovered over 36,000 unique\nmalicious servers, an increase of 109% from 2022. This uptick is primarily due to a marked increase in\nthe malware and tools that we are detecting after increasing our efforts in detection development\ncompared to 2022, not because of any significant increase in malicious infrastructure development and\nuse. We created several hundred infrastructure detection signatures in 2023; we are constantly creating\nnew signatures, and we continue to monitor and update existing ones.\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\n#### A Note on Collection Bias\n\nRecorded Future collects data on C2 servers based predominantly on traits from known malware\nfamilies and their server-side software. Our collection is focused on C2 frameworks and malware and\ntheir supporting infrastructure; detections include passive and active internet scan data. We only verify\nthat an IP address is a C2 server with proof of activity matching specific details. This methodology\nshould not act as a replacement for identifying suspicious or anomalous traffic and artifacts inside a\nnetwork.\n\n## Threat Analysis\n\n#### 2023 Adversary Infrastructure Trends\n\nIn 2023, we detected 36,022 malicious servers, surpassing the 17,233 servers identified in 2022 by\nmore than twice the amount. We have broken down our top findings by the following malware\nclassifications:\n\n1. Remote Access Trojans and Backdoors\n2. Offensive Security Tooling\n3. Information Stealers\n4. Botnets\n\n**Top 20 Remote Access Trojans and Backdoors**\n\nOur top 20 families for remote access trojans and backdoors are shown in Figure 2 below.\n\nThe top 5 malware families we detected this year are AsyncRAT, Quasar RAT, PlugX, ShadowPad, and\nDarkComet. Interestingly, the top 2 detections are open-source, and the last 3 are well-established\n[tools, showing that our statement from last year's report remains true:](https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/2022-adversary-infrastructure-report)\n\n[The] high level of commodity tool use indicates that threat actors are more concerned with\nblending in and being non-attributable rather than being undetectable, or have simply\ndetermined that their targets are not likely to detect even these well-known tools.\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 2: Top 20 RATs and backdoors, based on the number of unique C2 servers observed (Source: Recorded Future)**\n\nTop RAT Spotlight: AsyncRAT\n\nAsyncRAT is a remote access tool written in C# that was published by NYAN-x-CAT on GitHub in\n[January 2019. The tool has been used](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/solutions/endpoint-security/ransomware-protection/asyncrat) by both state-sponsored and financially motivated threat actors.\nAsyncRAT consists of 2 key components:\n\n1. A C2 server with an operator interface. The C2 server allows an operator to build, configure, and\ntask new AsyncRAT clients.\n2. The AsyncRAT client is deployed on a victim’s host.\n\nAsyncRAT has many capabilities, including screen captures, keylogging (using another tool written by\nNYAN-x-CAT, LimeLogger), file upload and download, password stealing, and disabling security tools\nsuch as Windows Defender. AsyncRAT uses a plugin system that makes it more extensible.\n\nRecent events involving AsyncRAT:\n\n  - It was [observed](https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/unmasking-asyncrat-new-infection-chain/) being distributed through malicious HTML files.\n\n  - It was [utilized in campaigns involving traffic distribution systems (TDSs), with one notable](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/security-brief-ta571-delivers-icedid-forked-loader)\ncampaign delivering NetSupport and DarkGate along with AsyncRAT.\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\n**Top 10 Offensive Security Tools**\n\nDespite a takedown and emerging offensive security tools (OST), Cobalt Strike remains our top\ndetected OST C2 family, raising questions about the effectiveness of Microsoft's Digital Crimes Unit’s\nattempt to disarm unlicensed instances of Cobalt Strike, something discussed further here.\n\nMetasploit and Meterpreter remain in heavy use but are also easily detected when used with the default\nsettings. Meterpreter can also be used in conjunction with Cobalt Strike, and while we can’t distinguish\nbetween the two, it is worth noting that a portion of our Meterpreter detections may also be related to\nCobalt Strike C2s as well.\n\n**Figure 3: Top 10 offensive security tools, based on the number of unique C2 servers observed (Source: Recorded Future)**\n\nTop OST Spotlight: Viper Penetration Tool\n\nSince Cobalt Strike, our most-detected OST, has already been heavily addressed in research over the\nyears, we will highlight the OST with the second-most C2 detections, the Viper Penetration Tool (Viper).\n[Viper’s GitHub readme states the following capabilities:](https://github.com/FunnyWolf/Viper/blob/master/README_EN.md)\n\n  - Viper is a graphical intranet penetration tool that modularizes and weaponizes the tactics and\ntechnologies commonly used in the process of Intranet penetration\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\n  - Viper integrates basic functions such as bypass anti-virus software, intranet tunnel, file\nmanagement, command line, and so on\n\n  - Viper has integrated 80+ modules covering Resource Development / Initial Access / Execution /\nPersistence / Privilege Escalation / Defense Evasion / Credential Access / Discovery / Lateral\nMovement / Collection and other categories\n\n  - Viper's goal is to help red team engineers improve attack efficiency, simplify operation, and\nreduce technical threshold\n\n  - Viper supports running native msfconsole in the browser and multi-person collaboration\n\nEven though we detect a steady amount of C2s for Viper, the use of this tool has not been openly\nassociated with any attacks.\n\n**Top 10 Information Stealers**\n\nInformation stealers are increasingly becoming an important part of attack chains for all threat actors.\nDespite the large number of information stealers in use, many of which are tracked by Recorded Future,\nwe have observed that most C2s were for RedLine Stealer and Raccoon Stealer.\n\nWe detected the most C2s for RedLine Stealer and the second-most for Raccoon Stealer. The high\nnumber of C2s detected for Raccoon Stealer is surprising, considering the events that have taken place\nover the last 18 months. In February 2022, Raccoon Stealer abruptly suspended its activities after the\nfalse [report](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2023/01/cybercriminal-faked-death-found) of the death of its key member, Mark Sokolovsky. Raccoon Stealer’s suspension forced\nmany threat actors to switch from Raccoon Stealer to other infostealer brands, including MetaStealer,\nBlackGuard, RedLine Stealer, and Vidar.\n\nHowever, Raccoon Stealer was not dead but instead went through new development. At the end of\nJune 2022, Raccoon Stealer was back with V2 and was officially [released for sale. In October 2022,](https://www.esentire.com/blog/esentire-threat-intelligence-malware-analysis-raccoon-stealer-v2-0)\nMark Sokolovsky was [indicted](https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdtx/pr/newly-unsealed-indictment-charges-ukrainian-national-international-cybercrime-operation) by the US Government for his role in Racoon Stealer. This again caused a\n[pause in the use of Raccoon Stealer for several months; Raccoon Stealer operations resumed in August](https://cyberint.com/blog/financial-services/raccoon-stealer/)\n2023.\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 4: Top 10 information stealers, based on the number of unique C2 servers observed (Source: Recorded Future)**\n\nTop Information Stealer Spotlight: RedLine Stealer\n\nRedLine Stealer is a malware family that has been active since at least 2019 and is popular among a\nwide array of cybercriminal threat actors. It provides significant enumeration capabilities aiding in the\ntheft of user credentials, tokens, and session cookies. Typically, a user is infected with RedLine after\nclicking a malicious link that subsequently installs RedLine components. RedLine will then enumerate\nthe victim’s device for network, system, and user information and then query for specific software\ninstallations to collect stored credentials, such as internet browsers, as well as email and instant\nmessaging applications. This information is packaged and exfiltrated to the attacker’s server for future\nuse or sale on various dark web marketplaces and shops, such as Russian Market and 2easy Shop.\n\nRecent events involving RedLine Stealer include:\n\n  - On November 8, 2023, Malwarebytes Labs observed that a threat actor was using Google Ads to\ndistribute a trojanized version of the popular CPU-Z tool to steal data. CPU-Z is used for profiling\ncomputer hardware on Microsoft Windows. The CPU-Z installer contained a malicious\nPowerShell script known as \"FakeBat\". This script fetched the RedLine Stealer malware to collect\nsensitive data from web browsers and cryptocurrency wallets.\n\n  - On September 11, 2023, FortiGuard Labs reported a phishing campaign that employed a\nMicrosoft Office Word document to distribute a trio of malware: RedLine Stealer, Agent Tesla,\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\nand OriginBotnet. This campaign aimed to collect a diverse set of data from the compromised\ndevices.\n\n  - In October 2023, Sucuri reported on [RedLine Stealer](https://blog.sucuri.net/2023/10/fakeupdateru-chrome-update-infection-spreads-trojan-malware.html) being distributed through compromised\nwebsites and fake browser update notices.\n\n  - In September 2023, RedLine Stealer was [observed being delivered by HijackLoader.](https://thehackernews.com/2023/09/new-hijackloader-modular-malware-loader.html)\n\n**Top Botnets**\n\nYear-over-year, we saw an increase in unique C2 servers for both QakBot and IcedID in 2023. The\ndisappearance of Emotet in June 2023, however, reduced the overall total number of botnet C2 servers\nwe identified in 2023. We do not think that this necessarily indicates a move away from the botnet\nmodel in the cybercrime ecosystem; however, we can see the effects of takedown attempts on both\nEmotet and QakBot. There may, over time, be a move away from these large, network bot systems as\nthey are ultimately prone to takedowns; distributed malware-as-a-service infrastructure, operated by a\nbroad array of users with differing tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and infrastructure are\nsimply harder to eradicate. However, there remains a need for services that botnets provide: one-stop\nshopping for initial access, downloading ransomware and other second-stage malware, credential theft,\nclickfraud, and more.\n\n**Figure 5: Top botnets, based on the number of unique C2 servers observed (Source: Recorded Future)**\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\nTop Botnet Spotlight: QakBot\n\nSince [emerging in 2007 as an information-stealing (banking) trojan, QakBot evolved into a](https://app.recordedfuture.com/portal/analyst-note/shared/true/doc:pNAcAp)\nmulti-purpose malware used by threat actors to perform reconnaissance, lateral movement, and data\nexfiltration and to deliver other payloads to infected systems. QakBot’s infection chain primarily starts\nvia phishing attacks, with initial access gained using emails with malicious HTML attachments that drop\na ZIP file containing a .LNK or VBS file. This file can launch an IMG, ISO, VHD, XLSB, SVG, or MSI file to\nexecute the malware.\n\nThe FBI [attempted](https://decoded.avast.io/threatresearch/avast-q3-2023-threat-report/) to dismantle the QakBot botnet in August, leading to a near-total drop in QakBot\nactivity. However, [reports suggest that the threat actors behind QakBot, known as TA577, were still able](https://securityboulevard.com/2023/10/qakbot-hackers-delivering-ransomware-despite-fbi-takedown/)\nto carry out phishing campaigns that distribute other malware, such as the Ransom Knight ransomware\nand Remcos. In December 2023, Microsoft [reported](https://x.com/msftsecintel/status/1735856754427047985?s=46&t=varGpLXboLoB6EBskOgDyA) a new QakBot campaign was observed. The\ncampaign was reportedly low in volume and targeted the hospitality industry.\n\n[DarkGate and PikaBot](https://thehackernews.com/2023/11/darkgate-and-pikabot-malware-resurrect.html) are two other malware families used by TA577 that have emerged at higher\nvolumes following the decline of QakBot. These malware families share similarities with QakBot in terms\nof their distribution methods, campaigns, and behaviors. They can deliver additional payloads once on a\ncompromised system, including cryptocurrency mining software, reconnaissance tools, and\n[ransomware. This campaign timeline shows](https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/darkgate-pikabot-surge-qakbot/) a surge in DarkGate activity after the takedown of QakBot\ninfrastructure.\n\n#### Takedowns and Resurrections\n\nDo takedowns help stop cybercriminal activity? There are a number of variables at play when a\ntakedown of malicious infrastructure occurs. Some of the factors include:\n\n  - Are the perpetrators physically in custody and hence unable to take responsive actions?\n\n  - Was the takedown only of a subset of the infrastructure?\n\n  - Was the infrastructure designed with redundancies that make a full takedown difficult?\n\n  - Do the operators have a “Plan B”, such as another malware or staged infrastructure that they can\nquickly switch to?\n\nWe review below 3 infrastructure takedown attempts that had evident effects in 2023 and assess their\ngeneral efficacy.\n\nEmotet\n\n[Emotet, the subject of a takedown attempt in January 2021, has disappeared and returned multiple](https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/world%E2%80%99s-most-dangerous-malware-emotet-disrupted-through-global-action)\ntimes since that initial takedown action. Emotet activity resumed in November 2021. Prior to the\nattempted takedown, Emotet regularly had rhythmic breaks in operations, but after the takedown,\nEmotet operations seemed to have an even more irregular cadence. Emotet operations post-takedown\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\nwere also [affected by Microsoft](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2023/07/06/whats-up-with-emotet/) [disabling VBA macros in documents in July 2022, since these macros](https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/22/microsoft-office-macros-blocked-default/)\nwere a primary initial access vector for Emotet.\n\nIn 2023, the Emotet operations we track disappeared in May, only to come back briefly a few weeks\nlater before another lengthy and possibly final disappearance. While it currently seems that the\nEmotet-related activity has ceased entirely, the period from the initial takedown in 2021 until mid-2023\nwitnessed several years of sporadic Emotet operations. This underscores the resilience achievable\nthrough a robustly designed infrastructure network and the persistence of determined criminals.\n\n**Figure 6: Emotet servers, 2023 (Source: Recorded Future)**\n\nQakBot\n\n[QakBot was the subject of a comprehensive US Department of Justice takedown at the end of August](https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/pr/qakbot-malware-disrupted-international-cyber-takedown)\n2023. Despite the continued observation of a limited number of C2 servers immediately following the\ntakedown, it became evident that the QakBot malware and its associated infrastructure were essentially\ninactive. However, TA577’s spam delivery infrastructure remained intact, and TA577 reportedly\n[continued](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/qakbot-affiliated-actors-distribute-ransom/) [its criminal activities by substituting other malware at its disposal for QakBot, such as Pikabot](https://app.recordedfuture.com/live/sc/7efsCpvcXYnI)\nand DarkGate. The introduction of DarkGate is interesting as this had not been identified in previous\nTA577 operations before.\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 7: QakBot servers, 2023 (Source: Recorded Future)**\n\nIn November 2023, we observed almost 40 new servers matching our detection signatures for QakBot\nservers. Our initial assessment was that this was most likely an indication of an upcoming attempt by\nTA577 to return to operations with an updated version of the QakBot malware. Our assessment aligns\nwith a December 2023 [report](https://x.com/msftsecintel/status/1735856754427047985?s=46&t=varGpLXboLoB6EBskOgDyA) from Microsoft that QakBot operations were resumed with a new [version](https://twitter.com/Threatlabz/status/1735863156738871470)\nof the malware, although the December operations were at a lesser scale than those seen before the\ntakedown.\n\nCobalt Strike\n\nThe March 2023 takedown of Cobalt Strike was a joint project between Microsoft, the Health\nInformation Sharing and Analysis Center (Health-ISAC), and Fortra, the software company that owns\nCobalt Strike. The action proceeded after a [court order](https://noticeofpleadings.com/crackedcobaltstrike/files/CourtOrders/2023-04-03%20Order_23-cv-2447_Microsoft%20Corporation%20et%20al%20v.%20John%20Does%201-2%20et%20al(907079167.1).pdf) that allowed it was issued from a US Federal\ncourt. The takedown was authorized based on unlicensed versions of Cobalt Strike in violation of\nFortra’s copyright or similar violations of Microsoft or Health-ISAC copyrights and thus was focused\nsolely on these cracked instances of the Cobalt Strike software.\n\n[The Cobalt Strike takedown in March](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/04/06/stopping-cybercriminals-from-abusing-security-tools/) 2023 had a noticeable impact initially, but it was far from\nlong-lasting. In fact, our data shows Cobalt Strike server numbers were back in their original range\nwithin a few weeks.\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 8: Cobalt Strike servers observed daily from March to April 2023 (Source: Recorded Future)**\n\nUnofficial attacks on Cobalt Strike servers have been [attempted](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-gangs-cobalt-strike-servers-ddosed-with-anti-russia-messages/) in the past. Cobalt Strike team servers\nhave been found to have technical [vulnerabilities that could be used against them. Takedown and](https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/hotcobalt-new-cobalt-strike-dos-vulnerability-that-lets-you-halt-operations/)\ndistributed denial-of-service (DDoS)-style attempts by hacktivists are seldom comprehensive or\norganized, however, and typically have limited results, although there have been some marginally\n[successful operations.](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/ukrainian-hacktivists-claim-trigona-ransomware-takedown-a-23343)\n\nAnalysis\n\nThe circumstances and results of the 3 cases studied above are all different, but an examination of\nthem provides us with a few takeaways.\n\nAlthough it cannot be stated with certainty that Emotet will not return, it appears at this time that the\n2021 takedown ultimately resulted in the termination of its operations. The Emotet takedown is an\nexample of an attempted takedown of a very well-organized and well-constructed C2 network with\nbuilt-in resilience, which was still able to operate post-takedown. The ultimate effectiveness of the\ntakedown was likely due to the friction created by the takedown effort on the malware operators,\nwhich, combined with other factors, led to its eventual demise.\n\nThe QakBot takedown, highlighted by the use of the C2 system to disable all connected bots, was\nhighly effective and resulted in the almost immediate collapse of the QakBot network and its\ninfrastructure. This success, however, is tempered by the fact that the operators were reportedly able\nto quickly continue their operations with the use of other malware, and QakBot malware operations\ncontinued in December 2023.\n\nThe Cobalt Strike takedown was unusual in several ways. Cobalt Strike is a commercially licensed\nproduct intended for red-teaming engagements; however, being a C2 framework, it can be employed\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\nfor malicious purposes. As such, the takedown was restricted in scope — it only targeted servers\nrunning unlicensed or “cracked” versions of the Cobalt Strike software and only specific IP addresses\nand domains identified with their use. Criminals using the software who were affected by the takedown\neffort could simply stand up new infrastructure after the initial takedown occurred, as the takedown\nfocused only on specific, named infrastructure and was not an effort to take down future unlicensed\nCobalt Strike servers, only those authorized in the court order.\n\nAlthough the unlicensed Cobalt Strike takedown had an initial effect, it waned quickly. While a\nshutdown of all Cobalt Strike servers is presently not feasible from a legal perspective, if executed,\nsuch a measure would likely have a significantly greater impact. It is difficult to discern from the Cobalt\nStrike example how a takedown of another framework would fare, especially if it were all-encompassing\nand not limited in scope as the Cobalt Strike takedown was. When a takedown is based solely on\nspecific IP addresses, domains, and servers, without addressing the core software implants as in the\nQakBot case, the effects will likely not be enduring. Any affected servers, IP addresses, and domain\nregistrations can be replaced quickly by most cybercriminal operations.\n\nFor purely criminal malware, such as QakBot and Emotet, broad-scale infrastructure takedowns clearly\nhave an effect on at least the tactical level, as operations are immediately hindered. Despite the\npotential resurgence of the malware, as witnessed with Emotet and possibly in future iterations of\nQakBot, the operational tempo typically diminishes over the ensuing months and years. On a strategic\nlevel, cybercriminals who are not taken into custody have been seen continuing operations by reviving\nthe malware or moving on to other tools and techniques. As such, takedowns can be seen to add\nsignificant friction to criminal malware operations, and do have an effect, but cannot be viewed as a\nsingular solution for cybercrime and malware operations. Takedowns must also be continued on a\nregular basis to create real disruption to cybercriminal activity.\n\n#### C2 Frameworks and the Primacy of Cobalt Strike\n\nCobalt Strike, Meterpreter, and Viper servers, numbering in the thousands monthly, are the top 3 among\nC2 frameworks in our observations. However, numerous other C2 frameworks also exist. Our detections\nof Meterpreter servers, generally regarded as a similarly popular tool, are of a lower volume than the\nCobalt Strike servers we observed. The most popular newer C2 framework that we see is Viper; its\nnumbers are now on par with Meterpreter.\n\nIn this section, we take a look at whether or not other C2 frameworks are gaining ground on Cobalt\nStrike’s market share.\n\nOur data indicates that both Havoc and Mythic have also become relatively popular but are still\nobserved in far lower numbers than Cobalt Strike, Meterpreter, or Viper. 4 other well-known frameworks\nare Sliver, Havoc, Brute Ratel (BRc4), and Mythic; Figure 9, below, shows composite monthly figures for\nthese 4 frameworks for 2023. There has been appreciable growth in usage of these “second-tier” C2\nframeworks in 2023.\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 9: Composite of Sliver, Havoc, Mythic, and BRc4 servers, 2023 (Source: Recorded Future)**\n\nAlthough this growth has been driven primarily by increases in Mythic and Havoc servers, we have also\nobserved continuous, steady use of BRc4 and Sliver servers throughout 2023.\n\nFor Cobalt Strike, it is sometimes impossible to discriminate between authorized security testing and\ncriminal usage of the tools outside of situations where cracked, unlicensed versions are detected, in\nwhich case the presumption is criminal use. This fact, combined with the popularity of Cobalt Strike and\nits relatively large number of licensed, authorized users, leads to a very high number of Cobalt Strike\nservers overall.\n\nMany new frameworks are discussed when first reported as potential replacements for Cobalt Strike,\nbut most of these we do not ultimately see in large numbers. Examples of C2 framework servers that\nwe are not seeing in large numbers yet are BRc4, Sliver, and Manjusaka.\n\nCobalt Strike is a very popular and stable segment of the offensive security tool ecosystem, but it is not\none that exhibited notable growth in the past year. By contrast, other C2 server families, such as Havoc\nand Mythic, are steadily increasing in number.\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 10: Cobalt Strike C2 servers, 2023 (Source: Recorded Future)**\n\nIn May of 2023, Sophos reported that Cobalt Strike [accounted](https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2023/05/18/the-phantom-menace-brute-ratel-remains-rare-and-targeted/) for about 20% of signature-based attack\ntool detections in the first quarter of 2023 (these tools included all tools used for attacks, not just C2\nframeworks). We similarly see a large percentage of all active C2 servers represented by Cobalt Strike.\n\nCobalt Strike remains the most commonly detected server of all the C2 frameworks for which we have\nsignatures. Although there are some other tools for which we see an appreciable C2 volume, our own\ndata corresponds with that shared by other researchers and incident responders in that no other C2\nframework is close to Cobalt Strike in terms of usage. Although there are several other popular C2\nframeworks, none are found at the scale of Cobalt Strike, despite the 2023 takedown attempt. That\nsaid, we believe that inroads are being made by new C2 frameworks due to the slow but steady\nincrease in usage of these other C2 tools, and our data indicates that Cobalt Strike’s share of the\nmarket is eroding. We do not believe that Cobalt Strike will be overtaken by any other particular C2\nframework in the near future, however.\n\n#### Trends in Russian State-Sponsored Operations\n\nOver the past 12 months, we have seen a slight shift in TTPs by Russian state-sponsored cyber actors,\nwho have increased their use of legitimate internet services. Free API services (mockbin[.]org and\nwebhook[.]site), website hosting (Infinityfree), and file hosting services (mocky[.]io and GitHub) have\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\nenabled them to blend into legitimate network traffic and made upstream infrastructure identification\nand tracking more difficult.\n\nRecorded Future has noticed a continuous evolution of the malicious infrastructure used in Russian\nstate-sponsored operations, meaning the actors are changing the services or technologies used on a\nweekly and sometimes daily basis. Geofencing is often enabled during broad phishing campaigns to\nrestrict malicious payloads to countries of interest and to reduce collateral. In a recent BlueDelta\ncampaign, Russian threat actors used JavaScript code hosted on a free API service, which checked the\nvictim’s location and only served malware if they were located in Austria, Lithuania, or Spain.\n\nRussia’s targeting has remained unchanged, with the adversaries favoring traditional espionage for\ngenerating intelligence for government interests, focusing heavily on governments in Europe and the\nwar in Ukraine. In October 2023, TAG-70 used a Zimbra webmail server zero-day to target government\nand military mail servers located across Europe.\n\n**Figure 11: Geographic spread of victims of TAG-70’s Roundcube exploit in October 2023 (Source: Recorded Future)**\n\n#### Trends in Chinese State-Sponsored Operations\n\n**Operational Infrastructure**\n\n[Chinese state-sponsored groups have increasingly been employing large anonymization networks,](https://www.recordedfuture.com/charting-chinas-climb-leading-global-cyber-power)\noften built from compromised IoT devices, including small office/home office (SOHO) routers, or\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\nthrough actor-provisioned virtual private servers (VPS), for use as operational infrastructure. Such\nanonymization networks are often more challenging to track for security researchers than traditional\nactor-provisioned infrastructure due to the volume of infrastructure that can be accumulated and as\ncompromised devices are also simultaneously used for legitimate purposes by their owners, allowing\nthreat actors to blend in with normal internet traffic. These networks can also allow threat actors to\nrapidly cycle infrastructure and use internet service provider (ISP) IP addresses geolocated in the same\ncountry as targeted entities.\n\nThe shared use of capabilities by Chinese state-sponsored groups also extends to these anonymization\nnetworks, with multiple groups observed employing shared services such as the “RedRelay”\nanonymization network [reported](https://www.pwc.at/de/dienstleistungen/Cyber/2022-year-in-retrospect-report.pdf) by PWC. This indicates that some of these services are likely provided\nas a quartermaster-style or commercial service arrangement. Examples of the use of anonymization\nnetworks by Chinese state-sponsored groups include TAG-38 activity targeting Indian critical\ninfrastructure, RedBravo (APT31) activity [targeting](https://www.cert.ssi.gouv.fr/uploads/CERTFR-2021-CTI-013.pdf) European governments, TAG-87 (Volt Typhoon)\n[targeting](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa23-144a) US critical infrastructure, and TAG-51 (BlackTech) targeting entities within Taiwan and Japan.\nIn the case of TAG-38, we identified the group using a network of compromised internet-facing,\nthird-party DVR/IP camera devices that were used to proxy ShadowPad C2 infrastructure to upstream\nactor-controlled servers.\n\n**Shared Capabilities**\n\nRecorded Future continues to observe the use of shared-capability supply chains through custom\nmalware and exploit developers that supply multiple Chinese state-sponsored groups associated with\nboth the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) and the Ministry of State Security (MSS). Some of the most\nwell-known shared Chinese capabilities include the PlugX and ShadowPad backdoors. Recorded Future\nobserved a steady continuation of new monthly PlugX servers and an overall increase in ShadowPad\nservers when compared with the previous 2 years' observations, as seen in Figures 12 and 13.\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 12: Comparison of new monthly PlugX server observations in 2023, 2022, and 2021 (Source: Recorded Future)**\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 13: Comparison of monthly ShadowPad server observations in 2023, 2022, and 2021 (Source: Recorded Future)**\n\nDuring 2023, Recorded Future found that PlugX servers were, on average, active for 33 days, with some\nstretching to 65 days, as well as the occasional outliers that remained online for much longer. In\ncomparison, ShadowPad servers were active for 13 days on average, with the upper quartile pushing 70\ndays online. Cycling the IP address of a C2 server frequently is a basic operational security practice for\nthreat actors; however, it isn’t always the case, as indicated above. Throughout the year, Recorded\nFuture identified 144 instances where a C2 server had hosted multiple malware families associated with\nChinese state-sponsored activity. The most popular pairing was PlugX and ShadowPad, accounting for\n97% of these servers; other combinations included Spyder Backdoor and Winnti malware.\n\n**Infrastructure Providers**\n\nThe Constant Company and its VPS service Vultr remain a firm favorite among Chinese state-sponsored\ngroups. Throughout 2023, Recorded Future observed over 1,000 malicious servers using The Constant\nCompany (AS20473) to host C2 servers for at least 6 known malware families associated with Chinese\nstate-sponsored activity. Other popular providers included Huawei Cloud (AS55990), BGPNET\n(AS64050), and Alibaba (US) Technology (AS45102).\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Trends in Iranian State-Sponsored Operations\n\n**Operational Infrastructure**\n\nIranian state-sponsored groups adopt varying degrees of sophistication when establishing and utilizing\n[operational infrastructure. The use of commercial and open-source VPNs (1,](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/04/07/mercury-and-dev-1084-destructive-attack-on-hybrid-environment/) [2) such as Private Internet](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/19/l/more-than-a-dozen-obfuscated-apt33-botnets-used-for-extreme-narrow-targeting.html)\nAccess, Mullvad, ExpressVPN, and OpenVPN are common among all major groups, including APT42\n(Charming Kitten, TA453, APT35), MuddyWater (Temp.Zagros, Static Kitten, Cobalt Ulster, and Mango\nSandstorm), and APT33 (Peach Sandstorm, Elfin, Refined Kitten).\n\nIn some cases, operational infrastructure is shared among groups when executing simultaneous\ntargeting, although this is usually compartmentalized between threat groups affiliated with either the\nMinistry of Intelligence (MOIS) or the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). Examples of these\n[cases include](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/09/08/microsoft-investigates-iranian-attacks-against-the-albanian-government/) the 2022 Albanian government attacks that depicted a broad MOIS-led operation\n[involving multiple threat groups, as reported by Microsoft. Another example is the targeting of Israeli](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/04/07/mercury-and-dev-1084-destructive-attack-on-hybrid-environment/)\n[entities by MuddyWater, which reportedly shared infrastructure with a threat actor tracked as DarkBit.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/04/07/mercury-and-dev-1084-destructive-attack-on-hybrid-environment/)\n\nIranian threat groups are also known for using Dynamic DNS (DDNS) services for attack operations;\nRecorded Future has observed groups such as APT42, MuddyWater, and APT33 using DDNS-linked\ninfrastructure for C2.\n\n**Infrastructure Providers**\n\nIranian state-sponsored threat groups have used a slew of infrastructure providers for their operations,\nincluding major providers such as NameCheap, Porkbun, OVH SaS, Hetzner Online GmbH,\nColoCrossing, Contabo GmbH, InMotion Hosting, and Tucows Inc.\n\nThe infrastructure adopted by these groups has also broadly used diverse top-level domains (TLDs)\nthat include .com, .co, .xyz, .site, .info, and .online, just to name a few. Iranian threat groups likely use\nintermediaries to engage with domain registrars outside of Iran. There is no observable trend in relation\nto their use of TLDs, which is highly dependent on threat group access to domain registration providers\ninside and outside Iran.\n\n#### Trends in North Korean State-Sponsored Operations\n\n**Operational Infrastructure**\n\nNorth Korean state-sponsored cyber actor infrastructure can be broken down into 2 broad categories:\ninfrastructure directly registered and set up by the actors and legitimate infrastructure that has been\ncompromised and is being used by North Korean threat actors for malicious purposes. In the former\ncase, most of the infrastructure we see being directly registered to North Korean operators is used for\nphishing operations. This is particularly the case for Kimsuky, an espionage-focused threat actor\nprimarily active in the Asia region, including its subgroups TAG-46 and TAG-66. We also see this with\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\nthe phishing and initial access operations of TAG-71, a North Korean threat group with links to\nCryptocore, in which the group registers its own infrastructure before using compromised infrastructure\nas C2 once it has compromised the target.\n\n**Infrastructure Providers**\n\nCommonly seen hosting providers used by North Korean threat groups include HostUS, Leaseweb Asia\nPacific, G-Core Labs S.A., EHostIDC, and Clouvider Limited. These groups register domains either\ndirectly using Namecheap, Hostinger, or Porkbun, or using the DDNS services FreeDNS or\n내도메인[.]한국 (translates to mydomain[.]korea). North Korean groups like to use link-shortening\nservices when delivering either phishing domains or initial access malware, including TinyURL and Bitly.\nFor compromised infrastructure, we see North Korean threat groups compromising insecure web\nservers of South Korean e-commerce websites, non-profit organizations, universities, and personal\nblogs, among others.\n\n## Mitigations\n\nTo help safeguard systems, we advise the following:\n\n  - Keep systems and software up-to-date and have a reliable and tested backup method.\n\n  - Exposed perimeter servers, including those for remote access, are abused by threat actors to\ngain initial access into a target’s network. If remote access solutions are crucial to daily\noperations, all remote access services (such as Citrix or RDP) should be implemented with\nmulti-factor authentication.\n\n  - Recorded Future clients can use the Recorded Future Intelligence Cloud to help identify actively\nexploited vulnerabilities and CVEs that have been positively associated with malware, which can\nhelp with patch management and prioritization.\n\n#### Detection-in-Depth\n\n  - Proactive detection creates an advantage for defenders, giving them time to ensure additional\nfile- and network-based detections are in place.\n\n  - Recorded Future clients can rapidly identify infections by detecting IP addresses found in the\nRecorded Future Command-and-Control List.\n\n  - Recorded Future clients can query any malware entity using the Recorded Future\nCommand-and-Control List to conduct similar research of their own.\n\n  - Employ detection-in-depth for common open-source tooling via correlation searches and Sigma\nqueries in security information and events (SIEMs) for suspicious behaviors, YARA rules for\nsuspicious file contents, and Snort rules for suspicious or malicious network traffic.\n\n  - The detection volumes for each of the malware families we monitor show the increased use of\nopen-source tools. Prioritize these families for network- and host-based detection in enterprise\nenvironments.\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\n  - External network detections are only part of the detection equation; detection-in-depth\n[methodologies, such as calculating the standard deviation of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=borfuQGrB8g&ab_channel=SANSDigitalForensicsandIncidentResponse) [beaconing intervals or using YARA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eETUi-AZYgc&ab_channel=BlackHillsInformationSecurity)\n[for memory inspection, can aid in the identification of malicious activity.](https://www.elastic.co/blog/detecting-cobalt-strike-with-memory-signatures)\n\n## Outlook\n\nWe expect an ever-changing infrastructure landscape for 2024 that, in many ways, is yet more of the\nsame. For example, we foresee takedowns of malicious infrastructure continuing and probably\nincreasing. Governments are starting to fully understand the devastating effects of ransomware and\nother destructive attacks and are taking action to combat them. Governments are taking cybercriminal\noperations that affect critical infrastructure such as hospitals seriously and are looking at the legal\nframeworks that allow actions to be taken against the attackers.\n\nTakedowns are an effective and disruptive tool for law enforcement to use against cybercriminals.\nUnfortunately, the ongoing operations by TA577, even after the QakBot takedown, underscore the\ntendency of criminal organizations to simply shift their tools. This holds true unless the individuals\nresponsible are apprehended or otherwise prevented from continuing their illicit activities.\n\nWe believe APTs will continue their shift toward the adoption of commodity tools when suited, including\nC2 frameworks, as these tools are effective and make attribution difficult. Similarly, all threat actors will\ncontinue making use of remote monitoring and management software (such as AnyDesk, Atera, and\nConnectWise) and legitimate internet infrastructure (such as Telegram, Github, and Google Drive),\nowing to their perceived legitimacy and insufficient network controls for these tools and services.\n\nArtificial intelligence is affecting various fields of endeavor, including cybercrime. Although not yet on\npar with human capabilities, AI, particularly large language models, simplifies tasks and reduces manual\neffort. 2024 will witness incremental progress in AI, not widespread adoption. Threat actors are\nexpected to use AI for domain naming, network planning and organization, and enhancing malware\ndevelopment with easier coding and advanced obfuscation techniques. This will result in greater\norganizational and technical efficiencies, a lower entry barrier for sophisticated attacks, and other\nadvantages to cybercriminals.\n\nRecorded Future[®] | www.recordedfuture.com | Distribution: Public, from Insikt Group\n\n\n-----\n\nAbout Insikt Group[®]\n\nRecorded Future’s Insikt Group, the company’s threat research division, comprises\nanalysts and security researchers with deep government, law enforcement, military, and\nintelligence agency experience.
