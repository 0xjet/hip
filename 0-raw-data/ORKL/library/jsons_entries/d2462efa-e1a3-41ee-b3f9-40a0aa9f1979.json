There are over 3.5 billion smartphone users worldwide, and it is\nestimated that over 85% of those devices – around 3 billion – run the Android OS. Therefore,\nit is no surprise that criminals and threat actors are actively targeting this vast user base for\ntheir own malicious purposes, from trying to steal users’ data and credentials, to planting\nmoneymaking malware, spyware or ransomware, and more.\n\nHowever, from the threat actors’ perspective, gaining a foothold on victims’ mobiles is an\nevolving challenge, because the built-in security features on some phones, and the\ncontrolled access to official app stores such as Google Play do offer a measure of protection\nto users. This means that would-be attackers have to develop new and innovative mobile\ninfection vectors, and use and refine new skills and techniques to bypass security protections\nand place malicious apps in official app stores.\n\nCheck Point Research (CPR) recently encountered a mastermind’s network of Android\n\n\n-----\n\nmobile malware development on the dark net. This discovery piqued our interest, as it was\nextraordinary, even by dark net standards. CPR researchers decided to dig deeper to learn\nmore about the threat actor behind the network, his products, and the business model behind\nmalicious targeting of Android mobile devices.\n\n## Deep dive: Journey into the Dark Web\n\nWe tracked the activity of the threat actor, who goes by the nickname Triangulum, in several\nDarknet forums.\n\n“Triangulum” in Latin means “triangle” and the term is commonly used in relation to the\nTriangulum galaxy which is a spiral galaxy located in the Triangulum constellation.\n\nJust like the Triangulum galaxy, it is hard to spot the traces of the Triangulum actor. But once\nyou do spot him, he’s relatively easy to follow.\n\n## Profile\n\n**Nickname**\n```\n: Triangulum™\n\n```\n**Skype**\n```\n: triangulum_10 | crook_62\n\n```\n**Email**\n```\n: [email protected]\n\n```\n**Discord**\n```\n: Triang#9504\n\n```\n**Alternate identities**\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n: Magicroot\n\n```\n**Alleged origin**\n```\n: Indian\n\n```\n**Strengths**\n```\n: High level of social skills combined with a math background in trigonometry,\nintegration and differentiation\n\n```\n**Age**\n```\n: Approximately 25 years old\n\n```\n**Personal details:**\n```\n - 190cm tall\n - had two tortoises as home pets back in 2017\n - had a girlfriend back in 2017 (current marital status is unknown)\n\n```\n**Preferable laptop models**\n```\n: Lenovo, HP, Sony, Dell\n\n```\nIn the past few years that Triangulum has been active in the dark corners of the internet, he\nhas shown an impressive learning curve. Over a two-year period, he dedicated most of his\ntime to evaluating the market needs and developing a merch network from scratch by\nmaintaining partnerships, rooting investments and distributing malware to potential buyers.\n\nTriangulum appears to have gotten started at the very beginning of 2017, when he joined the\nhack forums in the Darknet.\n\nTriangulum initially exhibited some technical skills by reverse engineering malware, but at\nthat point in time still seemed to be an amateur developer.\n\nTriangulum also communicated with different users, trying to estimate the market value for\ndifferent kind of malware.\n\nOn June 10, 2017, Triangulum provided a first glimpse of a product he developed by himself.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1. Triangulum teaser for the 1st version of his product._\n\nThis product was a mobile RAT that targeted Android devices, and was capable of exfiltrating\nsensitive data to a C&C server, as well as destroying local data, even deleting the entire OS.\n\nAs Triangulum moved on to marketing his product, he looked for investors and a partner to\nhelp him create a PoC to show off the RAT’s capabilities in all its glory.\n\n_Figure 2. Message from Triangulum suggesting investment in his product._\n\n_Figure 3. Looking for a partner._\n\nOn October 20, 2017, Triangulum offered his first malware for sale. After that, Triangulum\nvanished from the radar for a period of a year and a half, with no evident signs of activity in\nthe Darknet.\n\nTriangulum surfaced again on April 6, 2019, with another product for sale. From this point on,\nTriangulum became very active, advertising 4 different products within half a year. It\nappeared that Triangulum had spent his time off creating a well-functioning production line\nfor developing and distribution malwares.\n\n## Helping hand\n\n\n_Figure 1. Triangulum teaser for the 1st version of his product._\n\n\n_Figure 3. Looking for a partner._\n\n\n-----\n\nMaintaining the production and marketing of multiple products in such a short period of time\nis a tall order, which raised our suspicion that there was more than one actor behind this\nmerch-network. It appeared that someone was helping Triangulum.\n\nAnd indeed, after further digging, we observed evidence that indicated Triangulum was\nsharing his kingdom with another actor nicknamed HexaGoN Dev.\n\nThis co-operation seems to have risen from previous deals between the two, as in the past\nTriangulum purchased several projects created by HeXaGoN Dev, who specialized in\ndeveloping Android OS malware products, RATs in particular.\n\n_Figure 4. In the past, Triangulum purchased a few projects created by HeXaGoN Dev._\n\nCombining the programming skills of HeXaGon Dev together with the social marketing skills\nof Triangulum, these 2 actors posed a legitimate threat.\n\n_Figure 5. HeXaGoN Dev responding to one of Rogue’s customers on behalf of Triangulum._\n\nWorking together, Triangulum and HeXaGoN Dev produced and distributed multiple\nmalwares for Android, including crypto miners, key loggers, and sophisticated P2P (Phone to\nPhone) MRATs.\n\n\n_Figure 5. HeXaGoN Dev responding to one of Rogue’s customers on behalf of Triangulum._\n\n\n_Figure 4. In the past, Triangulum purchased a few projects created by HeXaGoN Dev._\n\n\n-----\n\n## Marketing efforts\n\nTriangulum advertised his products on different Darknet forums, even using the services of a\nvisual illustrator to design attractive and catchy info brochures for the products. This was a\nmajor improvement over his older advertising efforts that looked pretty amateurish.\n\n_Figure 6. Advertisement of a product for sale in 2017._\n\n\n_Figure 6. Advertisement of a product for sale in 2017._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7. Advertisements of products for sale in 2019 (DarkShades) and 2020 (Rogue)._\n\nDespite the fact the malware was sold at affordable prices and with different subscription\nplans, apparently that wasn’t enough for the Triangulum team.\n\nWe observed some dirty marketing tricks from the actors. Once, HeXaGoN Dev pretended to\nbe a potential buyer, and commented on one of Triangulum’s posts, promoting the product\nand praising the development in order to attract more customers.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8. Triangulum responds to HeXaGoN Dev’s comment which was designed to whip up interest on the buyers’ side._\n\nIt is interesting to note that the team doesn’t want to show demo videos of their products in\naction.\n\n_Figure 9. Triangulum explains that a demo video is unnecessary._\n\n## Reputation\n\nWe’ve seen indications that Triangulum is obsessed with his reputation and cares about his\npopularity with the same level of thoroughness as he does about maximizing his profits.\n\nHe fanatically defends his products and tries to crush anyone brave enough to raise\nuncomfortable questions about or discredit his work.\n\n_Figure 10. Triangulum’s arguments in an online dispute._\n\nTriangulum’s reputation allows him to be a respected member of the hacking society; he\nreceives a lot of positive feedback and has a high status on his home forum.\n\n\n_Figure 10. Triangulum’s arguments in an online dispute._\n\n\n_Figure 9. Triangulum explains that a demo video is unnecessary._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 11. Triangulum’s reputation on his home forum._\n\nOf course, this helps his sales as well: when customers see someone who is a long-term\nmember with many products behind him, together with positive feedback from other users\nand confident replies by the author, this makes them more inclined to make a purchase.\n\n_Figure 12. Feedback about Triangulum’s products from users._\n\nCustomers apparently flock to Triangulum, despite the lack of demo videos, as well as\nevidence of dirty marketing tricks and some other warning flags.\n\n## Learning through failure\n\nHowever, as Triangulum soon learned, a good reputation on his home forum does not\nguarantee automatic success on others.\n\nIn April 2020, Triangulum attempted to spread his sales network to the Russian segment of\nthe Darknet. He made a post offering one of his products for sale.\n\n\n_Figure 12. Feedback about Triangulum’s products from users._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 13. Post offering one of Triangulum’s products for sale._\n\nDespite his previous reputation on his home forum, he didn’t receive a warm welcome here.\nUsers were not ready to pay for the product without a demo video, especially to a relative\nunknown as he was on this new site. As he did previously, Triangulum stated that he didn’t\nfeel it necessary to provide demo videos.\n\n_Figure 14. Triangulum suggesting buying instead of trying._\n\nAfter several other increasingly acrimonious posts, the topic was closed with the resolution\n“Topic-author could not be trusted” with a suggestion to attempt to gain users’ trust. All of this\ntranspired within a period of just 5 days after the topic was opened.\n\n_Figure 15. Triangulum sales didn’t even get a start on the Russian Darknet forum._\n\n\n_Figure 13. Post offering one of Triangulum’s products for sale._\n\n\n_Figure 15. Triangulum sales didn’t even get a start on the Russian Darknet forum._\n\n\n-----\n\nWhat worked well in Triangulum s home forum didn t stand a chance in the Russian\nsegment. Triangulum clearly took this lesson to heart, as we have not observed any activity\nin other Darknet segments since then. Instead of adjusting to customer demands, he stuck to\nhis scheme of what had worked previously, and didn’t want to change it even slightly.\n\n## Punchline\n\nAfter years of efforts which included trying different marketing techniques that involved\nauthentic sales manipulations, HeXaGoN and Triangulum were now ready to present their\nlatest creation, crown jewel – Rogue.\n\n## Dissecting the impostor: Taking a peek at the Rogue malware\n\nThe Rogue malware family is an MRAT. This type of malware can gain control over the host\ndevice and exfiltrate any kind of data (photos, location, contacts, messages, etc.), modify the\nfiles on the device, download additional payloads and basically anything else that comes to\nmind.\n\n## Malware origins\n\nInside the Rogue package, we found two main components. One was what appeared to be\n**DarkShades malware, and the other one was Hawkshaw. What’s so interesting here is that**\nneither of them initially belonged to Triangulum.\n\nDarkShades was originally sold in the Darknet by HeXaGoN in August 2019.\n\n_Figure 16. DarkShades sold by HeXaGoN._\n\nThe DarkShades project was officially sold to Triangulum 3 days after the initial sales began,\nand a new sales thread was created, this time by Triangulum himself.\n\n\n_Figure 16. DarkShades sold by HeXaGoN._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 17. DarkShades sold by Triangulum._\n\nWhat Triangulum did was to embellish the advertisement (see figure 7, to the left) compared\nto the original one.\n\n_Figure 18. DarkShades as originally advertised by HeXaGoN._\n\n\n_Figure 18. DarkShades as originally advertised by HeXaGoN._\n\n\n-----\n\nDarkShades was not the original product developed, as indicated by the name of its main\npackage (“com.cosmos”) which is a direct link to another product sold by HeXaGoN earlier\nthat year: Cosmos RAT.\n\n_Figure 19. Cosmos RAT advertisement; this malware was offered for sale by HeXaGoN._\n\n\n_Figure 19. Cosmos RAT advertisement; this malware was offered for sale by HeXaGoN._\n\n\n-----\n\nInterestingly enough, this malware was not acquired to be re-sold by Triangulum. Given the\nfact how methodically he re-sold other HeXaGoN products, this gap is likely due to\nDarkShades being a superior successor to Cosmos. Thus, re-sale of Cosmos was\nunnecessary.\n\nRegarding Hawkshaw, its malware source code was leaked in 2017 and is available on the\nweb ever since. The version that we discovered inside the Rogue package is “v.1.17”.\n\nA summary of Rogue’s genealogic tree is shown in the diagram below:\n\n_Figure 20. Rogue malware origins._\n\nRogue appears to be the latest iteration in malware developed and maintained by HeXaGoN\nand Triangulum. However, we cannot call it an entirely new malware family. Rather, it’s the\ncombined version of the Cosmos and Hawkshaw malware families. We also have to add that\nTriangulum didn’t develop his creation from scratch, but took what was available from both\nworlds, open-source and the Darknet, and united these components.\n\n## Technical details\n\nLet’s take a look at what the Rogue package has under the hood.\n\n### Maintaining persistence\n\nWhen Rogue successfully gains all of the required permissions (if all of the required\npermissions are not granted, it will repeatedly ask the user to grant the missing permissions),\nit hides its icon as a camouflage defense, making sure it will not be easy to get rid of it.\n\nThe malware then registers as a device administrator. If the user tries to revoke the admin\npermission, an onscreen message designed to strike terror in the heart of the user appears:\n“Are you sure to wipe all the data??”\n\nIn addition, by comparing specific pre-defined values to ones given by the system, Rogue\ncan detect a virtual environment, which may lead to a delay\\abort of its malicious intentions.\n\n\n_Figure 20. Rogue malware origins._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 21. The malware hides its icon._\n\n### Networking\n\nThe Rogue malware family adopted the services of the Firebase platform to disguise its\nmalicious intentions and masquerade as a legitimate Google service.\n\nRogue uses Firebase’s services as a C&C (command and control) server, which means that\nall of the commands that control the malware and all of the information stolen by the malware\nis delivered using Firebase’s infrastructure.\n\nGoogle Firebase incorporates a dozen of services to help developers create mobile and web\napplications. The Rogue malware uses the following ones:\n\n“Cloud Messaging” to receive commands from the C&C.\n“Realtime Database” to upload data from the device.\n“Cloud Firestore” to upload files.\n\nThere are multiple types of Firebase accounts hidden in the code of the Rogue malware:\n\nGUARDIAO\nPHOENIX\nSPITFIRE\n\n\n_Figure 21. The malware hides its icon._\n\n\n-----\n\nAVIRTEK\nHAWKSHAW\n\nIn addition, depending on the value of the field “APP_VERSION” in the malware’s manifest\nfile, Rogue can run on “MINIMUM” configuration, which as the configuration name suggest,\nis designed to draw the minimum amount of attention.\n\nBelow is the full list of commands and capabilities that can be executed by the Rogue\nmalware:\n\n**Command** **Description** **Configuration**\n\ngetLocation Add current location and current\ntimestamp to the Firebase Database.\n\ngetMessages SMS messages and the current\ntimestamp are added to the Firebase\nDatabase.\n\n\nmakeCall Application initiates a phone call to a\nprovided phone number.\nIf there is no phone number provided,\nthe call goes to “+91987654321”.\nThe number “+91987654321” seems to\nbe a defafult value for command,\nhowever it is not a coincidence that it\nbegins with India’s country code (91).\n\ngetImages Make thumbnails of an album with its\nname and upload thumbnails to the\nFirebase Cloud Store.

Rogue uploads the documented data._\n\nIn addition, the malware registers its own notification service which is used to sniff every\nnotification that pops up on the infected device.\n\nEvery notification that is triggered after the implantation of the service, is being saved to a\nlocal predetermined database and will later be uploaded to the Firebase Database.\n\nThe malware saves multiple types of notifications and parses them by splitting each\nnotification into these fields:\n\nMessage Body\nSender\nTimestamp\n\nHowever, notifications from the following list, which usually contain more sensitive and higher\nvalue data, are parsed separately:\n\ncom.facebook.katana\ncom.facebook.orca\ncom.instagram.android\n\n\n_Figure 22. Rogue uploads the documented data._\n\n\n-----\n\ncom.whatsapp\ncom.skype.raider\norg.telegram.messenger\nkik.android\njp.naver.line.android\ncom.google.android.gm\norg.telegram.messenger\nkik.android\njp.naver.line.android\ncom.tencent.mm\n\n_Figure 23. Rogue saves the notifications._\n\nRogue also maintains a “Block List” for phone numbers. The malware can choose which\nnumbers are in this list, and if it detects an incoming or an outgoing call to one of these\nnumbers, it drops the call.\n\nThis is done by registering a call receiver called “me.hawkshaw.receiver.CallReceiver” that\nlater uses the “CallBlock” handler to block a certain call.\n\n_Figure 24. Rogue registers the call receiver._\n\nOn the other hand, when accepting calls, Rogue can record each and every call, incoming or\noutgoing, and leak it to the Firebase Cloud Store.\n\n\n_Figure 23. Rogue saves the notifications._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 25. Rogue listens to every call._\n\n## Current state of affairs\n\nIn April 2020, the Rogue RAT package was leaked on one of the Darknet forums.\n\nIt’s reasonable to assume that the leakage could majorly affect Triangulum’s sales. However,\nit turns out that the reputation forged on his home Darknet forum does speak for itself; even\nafter the leakage, Triangulum’s team still receives messages on his home Darknet forum\nfrom interested customers.\n\n_Figure 26. Message on September 14, 2020 from an interested customer._\n\nIn fact, at the time this report was written, Triangulum is still active and expanding his\ncustomer network. Despite all the obstacles and some failures (like an unsuccessful attempt\nto start sales in the Russian Darknet segment) along the way, together with HeXaGoN he still\ndistributes malware products through his home Darknet forum.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Rogue malware and the story behind it is the perfect example of how mobile devices are\nexploited.\n\n\n_Figure 25. Rogue listens to every call._\n\n\n-----\n\nJust like with Rogue malware, other threat actors are practicing and learning, sometimes for\nyears, till they are ready to apply their knowledge as effectively as they can, in either\nmalware development or malware sales.\n\nTriangulum shows would-be threat actors that you don’t have to invent new malware every\ntime you want to offer a new product for sale. Instead, you can apply your soft skills in\nmarketing to build up and maintain a sales reputation, and create catchy advertisement and\ndifferent names for a product that appears to be another version of what already exists.\n\nWe leave it as an exercise to the reader to compare the two brochures with advertisements\nof DarkShades and Rogue (see figure 7), and find the differences between them.\n\nA lesson to draw here is that threat actors have created a reality in which we cannot be\ncomplacent. We must stay constantly vigilant for threats that are lurking around the corner\nand understand how to protect ourselves from them.\n\nIn any case, if you’re stepping into this arena, you’d better come prepared.\n\nIn this research, CPR uncovered a fully active market that sells malicious mobile malware,\nliving and flourishing on the dark net and other related web forums.\n\nSimilar to Triangulum, other threat actors are perfecting their craft and selling mobile\nmalware across the dark Web – so we need to stay vigilant for new threats that are lurking\naround the corner and understand how to protect ourselves from them.\n\n## Stay Protected From Mobile Threats\n\n[Check Point SandBlast Mobile is the](https://www.checkpoint.com/products/mobile-security/) [market-leading
