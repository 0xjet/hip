Although a coordinated law enforcement effort shut down this malware in\nJanuary 2021, Emotet resumed operations in November 2021. Since then, Emotet has\nreturned to its status as a prominent threat.\n\nThis blog provides a background on Emotet, and it reviews activity from this malware family\nsince its return in November 2021. The information covers changes in Emotet operations\nfrom its revival through the end of January 2022. These examples will provide a more\ncomprehensive picture and better indicate the worldwide threat Emotet currently poses.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Palo Alto Networks customers are protected from Emotet with Cortex XDR or our](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cortex/cortex-xdr) NextGeneration Firewall with [WildFire and](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/secure-the-network/wildfire) [Threat Prevention subscriptions.](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/threat-prevention)\n\nPrimary Malware Discussed [Emotet](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/tag/Emotet/)\n\nOperating System Affected Windows\n\nRelated Unit 42 Topics [Malware,](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/category/malware-2/) [macros,](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/tag/macros/) [phishing](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/tag/phishing/)\n\n## Table of Contents\n\nBackground on Emotet\n\nVisual Timeline\n\nEmotet in November 2021\n\nEmotet Abuses Microsoft App Installer\n\nEmotet in December 2021\n\nEmotet in January 2022\n\nConclusion\n\nIndicators of Compromise\n\nAppendix A: Emotet epoch 4 activity on Nov. 18, 2021\n\nAppendix B: Emotet epoch 4 abusing App Installer on Nov. 30, 2021\n\nAppendix C: Emotet epoch 4 infection on Dec. 21, 2021\n\nAppendix D: Emotet epoch 5 infection on Jan. 11, 2022\n\nAdditional Resources\n\n## Background on Emotet\n\nSometimes referred to as Geodo or Feodo, Emotet is Windows-based malware that first\nappeared in 2014 as a banking Trojan. Since then, Emotet has evolved into modular\nmalware that performs various functions, including information stealing, spambot activity and\nloading other malware.\n\n[The threat actor behind Emotet is known through different designators, like Mealybug,](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/evolution-emotet-trojan-distributor)\n[MUMMY SPIDER or](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/meet-crowdstrikes-adversary-of-the-month-for-february-mummy-spider/) [TA542.](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/threat-actor-profile-ta542-banker-malware-distribution-service)\n\nEmotet’s primary method of distribution is through email.\n\nEmotet is a prolific spammer. Emotet-infected computers often act as spambots, sending a\ndozen or more emails every minute that push more Emotet. This means thousands of\nEmotet emails can be sent by a single host every day. If hundreds of Emotet-infected hosts\nare active at any given time, this means hundreds of thousands of Emotet emails can be\ngenerated each day Emotet is actively spamming.\n\n\n-----\n\nEmotet is evasive. Through a technique called hashbusting, Emotet generates different file\nhashes for malware distributed through its botnets. This ensures a malware sample’s\n[SHA256 hash is different on each infected system. Emotet also uses obfuscated code in](https://twitter.com/malwaretechblog/status/1251606958592757760)\nscripts used during its initial infection process.\n\nEmotet is nimble. Its botnets frequently update IP addresses and TCP ports used for\ncommand and control (C2) communications. Emotet also frequently changes URLs hosting\nits malware, sometimes using dozens of different URLs each day.\n\nEmails distributing Emotet contain malicious attachments, or they contain links to malicious\nfiles. These messages most often contain Microsoft Office files like Word documents or Excel\nspreadsheets. These Office documents contain malicious macro code. The code is designed\nto infect a vulnerable Windows host after a victim enables macros.\n\n[As it rose to prominence, Emotet began distributing other malware like Gootkit,](https://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/Emotet+infections+and+followup+malware/24532/) [IcedID,](https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/2019/01/18/index.html)\n[Qakbot and](https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/2020/08/10/index.html) [Trickbot.](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-malware-team-malspam-pushing-emotet-trickbot/)\n\n[By September 2019, Emotet's infrastructure was running on three separate botnets. These](https://twitter.com/Cryptolaemus1/status/1174195815876894720)\n[botnets were designated by the security research team Cryptolaemus as epoch 1, epoch 2](https://paste.cryptolaemus.com/about/)\nand epoch 3. The epoch designators are often abbreviated as E1, E2 and E3.\n\n[By 2020, a significant portion of malicious spam pushing Emotet used thread hijacking.](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/emotet-thread-hijacking/)\nThread hijacking is a technique that utilizes legitimate messages stolen from infected\ncomputers' email clients. Emotet emails have frequently spoofed legitimate users and\nimpersonated replies to these stolen emails.\n\nEmotet occasionally takes a break from delivering malicious emails. Emotet's longest\nabsence from the threat landscape occurred in early February 2020 and lasted more than\nfive months. Emotet resumed operations in mid-July 2020, and it quickly surpassed other\nthreats in sheer volume of malicious spam.\n\nIn January 2021, a collaborative effort by law enforcement agencies and other authorities\n[disrupted Emotet operations. This effectively stopped the threat actor, and Emotet](https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/world%E2%80%99s-most-dangerous-malware-emotet-disrupted-through-global-action)\ndisappeared from our threat landscape.\n\nApproximately 10 months later, Emotet resumed operations in mid-November 2021.\n\n## Visual Timeline\n\nFigure 1 presents a timeline of Emotet operations from its return in mid-November 2021\nthrough January 2022. The timeline highlights notable Emotet activity during the three month\nperiod covered in this blog.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. Timeline of Emotet operations from November 2021 through January 2022.\n\n## Emotet in November 2021\n\n[On Sunday, Nov. 14, 2021, security researcher Luca Ebach discovered a new Emotet binary](https://cyber.wtf/author/lucaebach1/)\n[delivered through a Trickbot infection. By Monday, Nov. 15,](https://cyber.wtf/2021/11/15/guess-whos-back/) the Emotet infrastructure had\nresumed normal operations and began generating a large volume of malicious spam.\n\nThe new Emotet infrastructure is running on two separate botnets designated as epoch 4\nand epoch 5. These designators are often abbreviated as E4 and E5.\n\nOn Nov. 15, malicious spam for Emotet had one of three types of attachments: a passwordprotected ZIP archive, a Word document or an Excel spreadsheet. This follows the same\nmethod we had typically seen with previous Emotet infections. Examples and more details\n[can be found in my post, “Emotet Returns.” See Figure 2 for a flow chart documenting the](https://isc.sans.edu/diary/Emotet+Returns/28044)\nchain of events.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2. Chain of events for Emotet infections seen on Monday, Nov. 15, 2021.\nAppendix A lists indicators of compromise from an infection on Wednesday, Nov. 18.\n\nBy Monday, Nov. 23, a batch file was added to the infection process as shown below in\nFigure 3.\n\nFigure 3. Chain of events for Emotet infections seen on Monday, Nov. 23, 2021.\nEmotet targets include various areas around the world. But even if victims are non-English\nspeakers, templates for the Office documents are still in English as shown below in Figures 4\nand 5 from an email targeting Italy.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4. Screenshot of Emotet email targeting Italy on Nov. 23, 2021.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5. Attachment from Italian email contained Excel spreadsheet for Emotet with an\nEnglish template.\nAt this time, enabling macros did not directly download and run the Emotet DLL. Instead, the\nmacro code dropped a batch file shown in Figure 6 and ran it with the following command:\n\nC:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\cmd.exe /c c:\\programdata\\sdfhiuwu.bat\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6. Batch file dropped after enabling macros for an Emotet infection on Nov. 23, 2021.\nAs an evasion technique, obfuscated script in the batch file generates a PowerShell\ncommand to retrieve an Emotet DLL and run it on the victim’s host. The PowerShell\ncommand uses a base64-encoded string as shown below in Figure 7.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7. PowerShell command using base64 encoded string.\nConverting the base64 string to ASCII text reveals the script shown below in Figure 8. This\nscript is designed to retrieve an Emotet DLL from one of seven URLs and save it to the\nC:\\ProgramData\\ directory. The Emotet DLL is run with rundll32.exe using a random string of\ncharacters as the entry point.\n\nFigure 8. Deobfuscated script from the base64 string in Figure 4.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe new Emotet DLL is similar to Emotet DLLs before the January 2021 takedown. Emotet is\nmade persistent under a randomly named folder under the infected user’s\nAppData\\Local\\Temp directory. The modified date of the persistent DLL is backdated exactly\none week prior to the infection. Emotet is made persistent through a Windows Registry\nupdate. Figure 9 shows an example from Nov. 23.\n\nFigure 9. Registry update to keep Emotet persistent after a reboot.\nSince Emotet reappeared in November 2021, post-infection C2 activity consists of encrypted\nHTTPS traffic. Certificate issuer data for Emotet C2 HTTPS traffic uses generic values often\nseen with other malware families. Figure 10 shows an example of Emotet C2 activity filtered\nin Wireshark to reveal the certificate issuer data.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 10. Reviewing certificate issuer data of Emotet HTTPS C2 traffic in Wireshark.\nAs shown above in Figure 10, certificate issuer data for Emotet C2 HTTPS traffic is:\n\nid-at-countryName=GB\n\nid-at-statOrProvinceName=London\n\nid-at-localityName=London\n\nid-at-organizationName=Global Security\n\nid-at-organizationalUnitName=IT Department\n\nid-at-commonName=example.com\n\nOf note, other malware families have used similar certificate issuer data, so this is not\nnecessarily unique to Emotet.\n\n[On Nov.r 30, Emotet switched tactics again and began abusing Microsoft’s App Installer as](https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/2021/11/30/index.html)\npart of its infection chain.\n\n## Emotet Abuses Microsoft App Installer\n\n[Now disabled by Microsoft, App Installer is a protocol for Windows 10 used to install software](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/msix/app-installer/installing-windows10-apps-we)\ndirectly from a web server, and it used XML-based app installer files with the extension\n[.appinstaller. This protocol had been previously abused for BazarLoader malware attacks in](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-10-app-installer-abused-in-bazarloader-malware-attacks/)\nNovember 2021. Figure 11 shows the flow chart for this type of Emotet infection.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 11. Flow chart for Emotet infections abusing Microsoft’s App Installer Protocol.\nThe attack technique starts with complaint report-themed emails with links to malicious\npages. These malicious pages are hosted on compromised websites, and they spoof Google\nDrive by using the same style of Google Drive pages, including a Google Drive icon that\nappears in the browser tab. The pages have links to supposedly preview a PDF-based\ncomplaint report. The link actually leads to a malicious .appinstaller file designed to infect a\nvulnerable Windows 10 host with Emotet.\n\nBelow, Figure 12 shows a thread-hijacked email from Nov. 30 with the malicious link, and\nFigure 13 shows the associated complaint page with a link to the malicious .appinstaller file.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 12. Thread-hijacked email from Nov. 30 with link to page for malicious app installer.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 13. Fake complaint report page with link to .appinstaller file for Emotet.\nAs shown above in Figure 13, the .appinstaller file pretends to be an Adobe PDF component.\nIn this case, criminals were abusing Microsoft Azure to host the malicious files. Below, Figure\n14 shows a malicious .appinstaller file opened in a text editor.\n\nFigure 14. Malicious .appinstaller file used for Emotet on Nov. 30.\nThe malicious .appinstaller file shown above in Figure 14 retrieves a malicious ZIP archive\nappended with an .appxbundle file extension from the same server. Below, Figure 15 shows\ncontents of the malicious .appxbundle.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 15. Malicious .appxbundle used for Emotet infection on Nov. 30.\nThe malicious .appxbundle impersonating an Adobe program contains various files including\nZIP archives with an .appx file extension. Together, the entire .appxbundle is designed to\nretrieve an Emotet DLL and run it on a vulnerable Windows host.\n\nIndicators and further details from the Nov. 30 activity can be found at Malware Traffic\nAnalysis. Due to the nature of these app installer files, this infection method was initially\ndifficult to detect. Fortunately, Microsoft quickly shut down Azure file servers hosting the app\n[installer files. Microsoft has also disabled the app installer protocol, so this no longer remains](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-disables-msix-protocol-handler-abused-in-emotet-attacks/)\nan avenue of attack for Emotet or other malware.\n\nAppendix B lists indicators of compromise from an Emotet infection abusing Microsoft’s App\nInstaller on Nov. 30.\n\n## Emotet in December 2021\n\nThroughout November 2021, examples of Emotet infections revealed data exfiltration and\nspambot activity. No indicators of followup malware were publicly reported until December\n2021. By Dec. 7, the Cryptolaemus research team confirmed Cobalt Strike had been\ndeployed to Emotet-infected Windows hosts.\n\nDecember 2021 saw at least one more wave of emails from Emotet attempting to abuse\nMicrosoft’s App Installer protocol. However, Emotet quickly moved on to other infection\npatterns and used different templates for Office documents, mostly Excel spreadsheets.\n\nIn the week leading to Christmas day, Emotet emails contained links to web pages on\nvarious compromised websites. These pages also pretended to be from Google Drive, and\nthey had links to download malicious Excel files. In this case, Emotet started using a new\ninfection pattern as shown in Figure 16.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 16. Emotet infection pattern seen from Dec. 21-Dec. 24.\nAbove, Figure 16 reveals a process Emotet occasionally used through at least February\n2022. We [previously reported details on one such variation from January.](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/new-emotet-infection-method/) Appendix C lists\nindicators of compromise from an Emotet infection using this method on Dec. 21.\n\nBelow, Figure 17 shows an email from Dec. 23 pushing Emotet, Figure 18 displays the\nwebsite from the email link, and Figure 19 reveals the downloaded Excel spreadsheet.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 17. Example of email from Dec. 23 pushing Emotet.\n\nFigure 18. Web page delivering malicious Excel spreadsheet leading to Emotet on Dec. 23.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 19. Malicious Excel spreadsheet downloaded from page shown in Figure 17.\nOn Thursday, Dec. 24, we saw similar emails with Christmas-themed subject lines and\nholiday wishes in the message text. This wave of emails delivered the same style of Excel\nspreadsheet shown above in Figure 19.\n\nBelow, Figure 20 shows one of these Christmas-themed emails, and Figure 21 displays the\nassociated web page that delivered an Excel spreadsheet.\n\nFigure 20. Example of Christmas-themed email from Dec. 24 pushing Emotet.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 21. Web page delivering malicious Excel spreadsheet leading to Emotet on Dec. 24.\nAfter Dec. 24, Emotet stopped spamming until after the new year.\n\n## Emotet in January 2022\n\n[On Tuesday, Jan. 11, 2022, Emotet resumed spamming after its holiday break. The emails](https://twitter.com/Cryptolaemus1/status/1480893070870818820)\ncontinued with links to fake complaint pages, and the pages were sometimes customized to\ninclude the recipient’s name. This method was prevalent until Jan. 20.\n\nFigures 22-24 show one such example from Jan. 20. In this example, the recipient’s name\nhas been sanitized to read as “Solomon Grundy” with an AOL email address, and the\nspoofed sender has been sanitized to read as alan.scott@thegreenlantern[.]net.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 22. Emotet email from Jan. 20.\n\nFigure 23. Fake complaint report page with recipient’s name sending Excel spreadsheet for\n\n\n-----\n\nEmotet.\n\nFigure 24. Excel spreadsheet for Emotet downloaded from fake complaint report web page.\nAppendix D lists indicators of compromise from an Emotet infection using this method on\nJan. 11.\n\nBy Friday, Jan. 21, Emotet emails went back to using attached Excel spreadsheets or\npassword-protected ZIP archives containing Excel spreadsheets. Throughout the rest of the\nmonth, Excel spreadsheets for Emotet alternated between the template shown above in\nFigure 24 and the template shown below in Figure 25.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 25. Excel spreadsheet template seen during the last full week of January 2022.\nIn January, we continued to see reports of Emotet pushing Cobalt Strike. During our lab\ntests, we routinely saw Emotet-infected hosts generate spambot activity starting from 35-45\nminutes after the initial infection.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSince its return in November 2021, Emotet has once again become one of the most prolific\nmalware families in our current threat landscape. Hundreds of thousands of emails can be\ngenerated each day Emotet is actively spamming. Hashbusting, code obfuscation and other\nevasion techniques make Emotet a significant threat.\n\nWindows users can lower their risk from Emotet through spam filtering, proper system\nadministration and ensuring their software is patched and up to date. Palo Alto Networks\n[customers are further protected from Emotet through Cortex XDR and our Next-Generation](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cortex/cortex-xdr)\nFirewall with [WildFire and](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/secure-the-network/wildfire) [Threat Prevention subscriptions.](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/threat-prevention)\n\nPalo Alto Networks has shared these findings, including file samples and indicators of\ncompromise, with our fellow Cyber Threat Alliance members.

Learn more about the Cyber Threat Alliance.](http://www.cyberthreatalliance.org/)\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n\n-----\n\nDue to hashbusting, daily changes in malware URLs and frequent changes for infection\npatterns, we can see hundreds of new indicators for Emotet every day. These indicators are\ntoo numerous and changes are too frequent to be useful in any single list. However,\n[abuse.ch is a research project that provides free trackers for Emotet botnet command and](https://abuse.ch/)\ncontrol servers, [URLs hosting Emotet malware
