We believe\n[the adversary exploited a recently patched vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint tracked by CVE-2019-0604, which is a remote code](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4462211/description-of-the-security-update-for-sharepoint-enterprise-server)\nexecution vulnerability used to compromise the server and eventually install a webshell. The actors uploaded a variety of tools that\nthey used to perform additional activities on the compromised network, such as dumping credentials, as well as locating and pivoting\n[to additional systems on the network. Of particular note is their use of tools to identify systems vulnerable to CVE-2017-0144, which](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2017-0144)\nis the same vulnerability exploited by EternalBlue that is best known for its use in the WannaCry attacks of 2017.\n\nThis activity appears related to campaigns exploiting CVE-2019-0604 mentioned in recent security alerts from Saudi Arabian National\nCyber Security Center and the [Canadian Center for Cyber Security. In addition to the aforementioned post-exploitation tools, the](https://cyber.gc.ca/en/alerts/china-chopper-malware-affecting-sharepoint-servers)\nactors used these webshells to upload legitimate executables that they would use DLL sideloading to run a malicious DLL that has\n[code overlaps with known Emissary Panda attacks. We also found the China Chopper webshell on the SharePoint servers, which](https://www.nccgroup.trust/uk/about-us/newsroom-and-events/blogs/2018/may/emissary-panda-a-potential-new-malicious-tool/)\nhas also been used by the Emissary Panda threat group.\n\nIn this blog, we provide details of the tools and tactics we observed on these compromised SharePoint servers, explain how we\nbelieve these connect to the Emissary Panda threat group, correlate our findings with those of the Saudi Arabian National Cyber\nSecurity Center and the Canadian Center for Cyber Security, and provide indicators of compromise (IoCs) from our research. You\n[can find the Adversary Playbook for the activity detailed in this blog here.](https://pan-unit42.github.io/playbook_viewer/)\n\nAttack Overview\n\n\n-----\n\nThis webshell activity took place across three SharePoint servers hosted by two different government organizations between April 1,\n2019 and April 16, 2019, where actors uploaded a total of 24 unique executables across the three SharePoint servers. Figure 1\nshows a timeline of when the files were uploaded to the three webshells. The timeline shows three main clusters of activity across the\nthree webshells, with activity occurring on two separate webshells (green and orange) within a very small window of time on April 2,\n2019 and the activity involving the third webshell two weeks later on April 16, 2019. The actors uploaded several of the same tools to\nacross these three webshells, which provides a relationship between the incidents and indicates that a single threat group is likely\ninvolved.\n\n_Figure 1. Timeline of file uploads across three related webshells_\n\nThe tools uploaded to the webshells range from legitimate applications such as cURL to post-exploitation tools such as Mimikatz. The\nthreat actors also uploaded tools to scan for and exploit potential vulnerabilities in the network, such as the well-known SMB\n[vulnerability patched in MS17-010 commonly exploited by EternalBlue to move laterally to other systems on the network. We also](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/securitybulletins/2017/ms17-010)\n[observed the actors uploading custom backdoors such as HyperBro which is commonly associated with Emissary Panda. Based on](https://securelist.com/luckymouse-hits-national-data-center/86083/)\nthe functionality of the various tools uploaded to the webshells, we believe the threat actors breach the SharePoint servers to use as\na beachhead, then attempt to move laterally across the network via stolen credentials and exploiting vulnerabilities.\n\nWebshells Installed\n\nAs previously mentioned, we found webshells installed on three SharePoint servers hosted at two different organizations, two of\nwhich had the same file name of errr.aspx and the other a filename of error2.aspx. The webshells were hosted at the following paths\non the compromised servers:\n\n/_layouts/15/error2.aspx\n\n/_layouts/15/errr.aspx\n\nWe were able to gather one of the webshells with which we saw the actor interacting, specifically the error2.aspx file listed above.\nThe error2.aspx file (SHA256: 006569f0a7e501e58fe15a4323eedc08f9865239131b28dc5f95f750b4767b38) is a variant of the Antak\n[webshell, which is part of a tool created for red teaming called Nishang. The specific variant of Antak in error2.aspx is version v0.5.0,](https://github.com/samratashok/nishang)\nwhich is an older version of the webshell that was updated in August 2015 to v0.7.6 to include some basic authentication functionality\n[and the ability to perform SQL queries. It’s possible the actors obtained Antak v0.5.0 via the Nishang GitHub repository or from](https://github.com/samratashok/nishang)\n[SecWiki’s GitHub that also has the v0.5.0 version of Antak. Figure 2 shows the Antak webshell loaded on one of the Sharepoint](https://github.com/SecWiki/WebShell-2/blob/master/Aspx/Antak%20Webshell.aspx)\nservers.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2. Antak webshell ‘error2.aspx’ used to upload post-exploitation tools_\n\nWhile we observed the threat actor uploading additional tools to the Antak webshell above, the Sharepoint server also had several\nother webshells installed. The additional webshells, specifically stylecs.aspx, stylecss.aspx, and test.aspx are listed in Table 1, and\nappear related to the China Chopper webshell. We cannot be sure all of these webshells were installed by the same actors, as\nmultiple actors could have exploited the SharePoint server. For instance, the China Chopper-related webshells are one-line of JScript\ncode that could be easily copied and used by multiple groups, and the Antak webshell is easily obtained from publicly accessible\nrepositories. However, the installation of China Chopper and the uploading of Emissary Panda related custom payloads to the Antak\n[webshell suggests they are likely related, as this threat group has used China Chopper to compromise servers in the past.](https://www.secureworks.com/research/threat-group-3390-targets-organizations-for-cyberespionage)\n\n**Filename** **SHA256**\n\nstylecs.aspx 2feae7574a2cc4dea2bff4eceb92e3a77cf682c0a1e78ee70be931a251794b86\n\nstylecss.aspx d1ab0dff44508bac9005e95299704a887b0ffc42734a34b30ebf6d3916053dbe\n\ntest.aspx 6b3f835acbd954af168184f57c9d8e6798898e9ee650bd543ea6f2e9d5cf6378\n\n_Table 1. Additional webshells hosted on Sharepoint server_\n\nThe stylecs.aspx webshell provides fairly significant functionality, as its developer wrote this webshell in JScript that ultimately runs\nany supplied JScript code provided to it within the HTTP request. Figure 3 shows this webshell’s code that will run supplied JScript\nprovided in base64 encoded format within the URL within a parameter e358efa489f58062f10dd7316b65649e. The parameter\ne358efa489f58062f10dd7316b65649e is interesting as it is the MD5 hash for the letter ‘t’, which is a known parameter for China\nChopper as mentioned in the next section.\n\n_Figure 3. China Chopper code found in stylecs.aspx webshell on SharePoint server_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe stylecss.aspx webshell is very similar to the stylecs.aspx, as it runs JScript provided within the\ne358efa489f58062f10dd7316b65649e parameter of the URL; however, the stylecss.aspx webshell does not accept base64 encoded\nJScript, but expects the JScript in cleartext that the actor would provide as URL safe text. Figure 4 shows the code within\nstylecss.aspx, which when compared to Figure 3 above shows the lack of the base64 decoding function ‘FromBase64String’.\n\n_Figure 4. China Chopper code found in stylecss.aspx webshell on SharePoint server_\n\nThe last webshell extracted from the Sharepoint server had a filename of test.aspx, which is very similar to the stylecs.aspx webshell\nas it runs base64 encoded JScript provided in the URL of the request. However, the test.aspx webshell uses a parameter related to\nthe compromised organization to obtain the base64 encoded JScript that it will run and display within the browser. The test.aspx shell\nalso includes code that sets the HTTP response status to a 404 Not Found, which will display an error page but will still run the\nprovided JScript. Figure 5 shows the code within the test.aspx file.\n\n_Figure 5. China Chopper code found in test.aspx webshell on SharePoint server_\n\nLinks to Security Advisories\n\nIn April 2019, several national security organizations released alerts on CVE-2019-0604 exploitation, including the Saudi Arabian\nNational Cyber Security Center and the [Canadian Center for Cyber Security. Both of these alerts discussed campaigns in which](https://cyber.gc.ca/en/alerts/china-chopper-malware-affecting-sharepoint-servers)\nactors used the CVE-2019-0604 to exploit SharePoint servers to install the China Chopper webshell. While we cannot confirm all of\nthe claims made in these advisories, we noticed overlaps in the webshell code hosted on the compromised SharePoint servers we\nobserved and the webshells mentioned in these advisories.\n\nThe Saudi Arabian National Cyber Security Center’s alert provided details regarding the activities carried out by the adversary. This\nalert also displayed the code associated with the China Chopper webshell observed in the attacks, which included Request.Item[\"t\"]\nto obtain JScript code from the ‘t’ parameter of the URL. As mentioned in the previous section, stylecs.aspx and stylecss.aspx both\nused a parameter of e358efa489f58062f10dd7316b65649e, which is the MD5 hash of ‘t’. This may suggest the actor modified the\nscript slightly between the attack we observed, and the attack mentioned in the NCSC advisory, all while retaining the same\nfunctionality. Also, the NCSC advisory mentioned that the actors used a file name stylecss.aspx for their webshell, which is the same\nfilename we saw associated with China Chopper.\n\nThe alert from the Canadian Center for Cyber Security included the SHA256 hashes of the files associated with the campaign, one of\nwhich was 05108ac3c3d708977f2d679bfa6d2eaf63b371e66428018a68efce4b6a45b4b4 for a file named pay.aspx. The pay.aspx file\nis part of the China Chopper webshell and is very similar to the stylecss.aspx webshell we discussed above, with the only major\ndifference is the URL parameter of ‘vuiHWNVJAEF’ within the URL that pay.aspx webshell uses to obtain and run JScript. Figure 6\nbelow shows a comparison between the stylecss.aspx and pay.aspx files.\n\n_Figure 6. Comparison between stylecss.aspx webshell and pay.aspx webshell discussed in Canadian Center for Cyber Security_\n_advisory_\n\nTools Uploaded\n\nDuring our research into this attack campaign, Unit 42 gathered several tools that the actor uploaded to the three webshells at the\ntwo government organizations. The chart in Figure 7 shows the same tools being uploaded to the webshells, which provided an initial\nlinkage between the activities. One of the overlapping tools uploaded to the webshells is the legitimate cURL application, which could\nbe used by multiple groups. The other overlapping files are tools used by the adversary to locate other systems on the network\n(etool.exe), check to see if they are vulnerable to CVE-2017-0144 (EternalBlue) patched in MS07-010 (checker1.exe) and pivot to\nthem using remote execution functionality offered by a tool similar to PsExec offered by [Impacket (psexec.exe). These tools are not](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket)\ncustom made by the adversary but still provide a medium confidence linkage between the activities. We also observed the actors\nuploading the HyperBro backdoor to one of the webshells, as well as legitimate executables that would sideload malicious DLLs that\nhave overlapping code associated with known Emissary Panda activity.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7. Relationships between tools uploaded to the three webshells hosted on SharePoint servers_\n\nThe actors uploaded 10 portable executables to the error2.aspx webshell, as seen in Table 2. The list of tools uploaded to this\nwebshell includes legitimate applications, such as cURL and a component of Sublime Text used to sideload a malicious DLL, which\nwe will discuss in an upcoming section. The list also includes several hack tools, such as Mimikatz for credential dumping and\nseveral compiled python scripts used to locate and compromise other systems on the local network. Lastly, we saw the actor\nuploading a custom backdoor called HyperBro, which has been associated with Emissary Panda operations in the past. We will\nprovide an analysis of the HyperBro tool in an upcoming section.\n\n**Filename** **SHA256** **Description**\n\nm2.exe b279a41359367408c627ffa8d80051ed0f04c76fbf6aed79b3b2963203e08ade Packed Mimikatz tool.\n\npsexec.exe 7eea6e15bb13a3b65cca9405829123761bf7d12c6dc3b81ce499d8f6a0b25fb7 [Compiled Impacket psexec](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/psexec.py)\n\ns.exe 04f48ed27a83a57a971e73072ac5c769709306f2714022770fb364fd575fd462 HyperBro backdoor\n\ncurl.exe abc16344cdfc78f532870f4dcfbb75794c9a7074e796477382564d7ba2122c7d Legitimate cURL\n\ncurl.exe bbb9cd70fdc581812822679e6a875dcf5b7d32fd529a1d564948a5a3f6f9e3ab Legitimate cURL\n\nchecker1.exe 090cefebef655be7f879f2f14bd849ac20c4051d0c13e55410a49789738fad98 Compiled EternalBlue checker\nscript\n\netool.exe 38fa396770e0ecf60fe1ce089422283e2dc8599489bd18d5eb033255dd8e370c C# Tool, likely from\n[https://github.com/mubix/netview](https://github.com/mubix/netview.)\n\nplugin_host.exe 738abaa80e8b6ed21e16302cb91f6566f9322aebf7a22464f11ee9f4501da711 Legitimate Sublime Text plugin\nhost\n\nPYTHON33.dll 2dde8881cd9b43633d69dfa60f23713d7375913845ac3fe9b4d8a618660c4528 Sideloaded DLL loaded by\nSublime Text\n\ncurl.exe bbb9cd70fdc581812822679e6a875dcf5b7d32fd529a1d564948a5a3f6f9e3ab Legitimate cURL.\n\n_Table 2. Unique tools uploaded to the error2.aspx webshell installed on a SharePoint server_\n\nWe saw 17 tools uploaded to the errr.aspx webshell hosted on the SharePoint server of one of the government organizations, which\nis in the middle of the chart in Figure 7.

Unique tools uploaded to the errr.aspx webshell installed on a SharePoint server_\n\nTwo of the tools, specifically the compiled zzz_exploit.py and checker.py suggest the actor would check and exploit remote systems if\nthey were not patched for MS17-010, which patched the CVE-2017-0144 (EternalBlue) vulnerability. Also, the use of the Mimikatz\nand pwdump tools suggests the adversary attempts to dump credentials on compromised systems. We were able to gather the\ncommand line arguments the actor used to run the SMB backdoor smb1.exe. The following arguments shows the actor using the\nSMB backdoor to attempt to run a batch script m.bat on a remote host using a domain username and the account’s password hash:\n\nc:\\programdata\\smb1.exe <redacted 10.0.0.0/8 IP> <redacted domain>\\<redacted username> :<redacted password hash> winsk\nc:\\programdata\\m.bat\n\nWe saw far fewer portable executable files uploaded to the second errr.aspx webshell, specifically the 3 files seen in Table 4. The\nfiles uploaded to this webshell included the same compiled python script that would scan remote systems that were vulnerable to\nCVE-2017-0144 (EternalBlue) that we saw uploaded to the other errr.aspx webshell. Also, we observed the actor uploading a\nlegitimate Microsoft application that would sideload a malicious DLL, of which was very similar to the DLL sideloaded by the Sublime\nText plugin host that was uploaded to the error2.aspx webshell.\n\n**Filename** **SHA256** **Description**\n\nchecker1.exe d0df8e1dcf30785a964ecdda9bd86374d35960e1817b25a6b0963da38e0b1333 Compiled MS17-010\n[checker](https://github.com/worawit/MS17-010/blob/master/checker.py)\n\nCreateMedia.exe 2bb22c7b97e4c4d07e17a259cbc48d72f7e3935aa873e3dd78d01c5bbf426088 Legitimate\nCreateMedia.exe\napplication from\nMicrosoft's System\nCenter 2012\nConfiguration Manager\n\nCreateTsMediaAdm.dll 06510504f30feb1adc7e423d5a24e67e5b97acbfafe40f253a054be8b1c4e8d7 Sideloaded DLL loaded\nby CreateMedia.exe\n\n_Table 4.

However, several of the tools uploaded to the webshells appear to be custom made and likely related to the Emissary Panda\nthreat group.\n\nHyperBro\n\nThe s.exe (SHA256: 04f48ed27a83a57a971e73072ac5c769709306f2714022770fb364fd575fd462) uploaded to the error2.aspx\nwebshell is a self-extracting 7-zip archive that is an example of the HyperBro backdoor. According to [Kaspersky and](https://securelist.com/luckymouse-hits-national-data-center/86083/) [SecureWorks](https://www.secureworks.com/research/a-peek-into-bronze-unions-toolbox)\nresearch, HyperBro is a custom backdoor developed and used by Emissary Panda in their attack campaigns. This sample of\nHyperBro is similar to the sample discussed in Kaspersky’s research, specifically using a legitimate pcAnywhere application to\nsideload a DLL to decrypt, decompress and run a payload embedded within a file named ‘thumb.db’. Table 5 shows the three files\nassociated with this HyperBro sample, which have the same file names as the self-extracting 7zip archives mentioned in Kaspersky’s\nblog (SHA256 hashes: 34a542356ac8a3f6e367c6827b728e18e905c71574b3813f163e043f70aa3bfa and\n2144aa68c7b2a6e3511e482d6759895210cf60c67f14b9485a0236af925d8233).\n\n**Filename** **SHA256** **Description**\n\nthinprobe.exe 76d2e897ca235beab44ee7eaab9ede7bc7868bbaeb7d6cb10b4323c07eb216af Symantec pcAnywhere\nthinprobe application\n\nthinhostprobedll.dll d40414b1173d59597ed1122361fe60303d3526f15320aede355c6ad9e7e239af Sideloaded DLL loaded by\nthinprobe.exe\n\nthumb.db 270ea24f2cef655bd89439ab76c1d49c80caaa8899ffa6f0ef36dc1beb894530 Contains encrypted and\ncompressed DLL payload\nrun by sideloaded DLL\n\n_Table 5. Files associated with the HyperBro tool uploaded to webshell on SharePoint server_\n\nThe functional payload is a DLL compiled on 2019-03-11 02:23:54, which has two functionalities depending if the binary has a\ncommand line argument -daemon or -worker passed to it. The daemon functionality handles the C2 communications portion of the\nTrojan, which is configured to communicate with 185.12.45[.]134 over HTTPS using the following URL:\n\nhxxps://185.12.45[.]134:443/ajax\n\nThe worker functionality acts on the data received from the C2 server, which is passed from the daemon to the worker via a named\npipe called \"\\\\.\\pipe\\testpipe\". The worker subjects the received data to a command handler whose available commands are listed in\nTable 6.\n\n**Command** **Sub-command** **Description**\n\n0x12 File manager\n\n0x10 Enumerate logical storage volumes\n\n0x11 Delete a specified file\n\n0x12 Upload a file\n\n0x13 Download a file\n\n0x17 List contents of a folder\n\n0x19 Run an application (CreateProcessW) or script/file (ShellExecuteW)\n\n0x13 Execute command on shell\n\n0x16 Takes screenshot\n\n0x19 Runs shellcode it injects into a newly created process 'msiexec.exe'\n\n0x1a Kill specific process\n\n0x1e Service manager\n\n0x17 List all services and their configurations\n\n0x19 Start a specified service\n\n\n-----\n\n0x1a Stop a specified service\n\n_Table 6. The commands available within the HyperBro tool’s command handler_\n\nUnknown Sideloaded Payloads\n\nTable 2 and 4 above include two legitimate executables used for DLL sideloading, specifically the plugin_host.exe application for\nSublime Text and the CreateMedia.exe application from Microsoft's System Center 2012 Configuration Manager. The plugin_host.exe\napplication imports several functions from a library named python33, which is how the legitimate application sideloads the malicious\nDLL named PYTHON33.dll. This is the first instance we have observed Sublime Text’s plugin host application used for sideloading.\nLike the plugin host application, the CreateMedia.exe application imports several functions from a library named CreateTsMediaAdm\nthat is leveraged to load the malicious DLL named CreateTsMediaAdm.dll.\n\nThe PYTHON33.dll and the CreateTsMediaAdm.dll libraries are very similar with BinDiff providing a 97% similarity with 99%\nconfidence between the two DLLs. The code diff in Figure 8 shows the decryption routine in PYTHON33.dll (right) and\nCreateTsMediaAdm.dll (left), both of which use an eight byte XOR key to decrypt a piece of shikata_ga_nai obfuscated shellcode.\nThe shellcode is responsible for patching the entry point of the legitimate application to call another function in the shellcode that is\nresponsible for loading a file with the library name with an .hlp extension (PYTHON33.hlp or CreateTsMediaAdm.hlp).\n\n_Figure 8. Code comparison between the sideloaded CreateTsMediaAdm.dll and PYTHON33.dll files uploaded to two webshells_\n\nUnfortunately, we do not have access to the PYTHON33.hlp or CreateTsMediaAdm.hlp files, so we do not know the final payload\nloaded by either of these DLLs. However, using [NCC Group’s research published in May 2018, we were able to discover code](https://www.nccgroup.trust/uk/about-us/newsroom-and-events/blogs/2018/may/emissary-panda-a-potential-new-malicious-tool/)\noverlaps between these DLLs and a sideloaded DLL that ran the SysUpdate tool that the NCC group has associated with an\nEmissary Panda campaign. Figure 9 shows a code comparison between the PYTHON33.dll (right) and inicore_v2.3.30.dll (left)\n(SHA256: 4d65d371a789aabe1beadcc10b38da1f998cd3ec87d4cc1cfbf0af014b783822), which was sideloaded to run the\nSysUpdate tool in a previous Emissary Panda campaign. The code overlaps below include the same technique to find the entry point\nof the loading executable and decrypting the first piece of shellcode used to patch the entry point.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 9. Code comparison between the sideloaded PYTHON33.dll uploaded to webshell and the inicore_v2.3.30.dll file sideloaded_\n_in previous Emissary Panda_ _attacks_\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Emissary Panda threat group loaded the China Chopper webshell onto SharePoint servers at two Government organizations in\nthe Middle East, which we believe with high confidence involved exploiting a remote code execution vulnerability in SharePoint\n[tracked in CVE-2019-0604. According to Microsoft’s advisory, this vulnerability was patched on March 12, 2019 and we first saw the](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4462211/description-of-the-security-update-for-sharepoint-enterprise-server)\nwebshell activity on April 1, 2019. This suggests that the threat group was able to quickly leverage a known vulnerability to exploit\nInternet facing servers to gain access to targeted networks.\n\nOnce the adversary established a foothold on the targeted network, they used China Chopper and other webshells to upload\nadditional tools to the SharePoint server to dump credentials, perform network reconnaissance and pivot to other systems. We\nbelieve the actors pivoted to other systems on the network using stolen credentials and by exploiting the CVE-2017-0144\n(EternalBlue) vulnerability patched in MS17-010. We also observed the actors uploading legitimate tools that would sideload DLLs,\nspecifically the Sublime Text plugin host and the Microsoft’s Create Media application, both of which we had never seen used for DLL\nsideloading before.\n\nPalo Alto Networks customers are protected by:\n\nThe CVE-2019-0604 vulnerability is covered by our IPS signature Microsoft Sharepoint Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\n(55411)\nAll illegitimate tools uploaded to the webshells are marked with malicious verdicts by WildFire and Traps.\n[AutoFocus customers can track the custom Emissary Panda payload seen uploaded to the webshell using the HyperBro tag,](https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.HyperBro)\nbut can also track the hack tools using the following tags (note the hack tools are used by multiple actors and not just Emissary\nPanda):\n\nPalo Alto Networks has shared our findings, including file samples and indicators of compromise, in this report with our fellow Cyber\nThreat Alliance members.
