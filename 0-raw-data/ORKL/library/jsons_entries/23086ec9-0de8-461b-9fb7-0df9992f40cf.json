We review\nthis ransomware group’s constantly changing schemes and discuss how companies can shore up defenses against this threat.\n\n\n-----\n\nView infographic of \"Ransomware Spotlight: Clop\"\n\n[Clop (sometimes stylized as “Cl0p”) has been one of the most prolific ransomware families in the past three years. It has gained infamy for](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tr/security/definition/ransomware)\ncompromising high-profile organizations in various industries worldwide using multilevel extortion techniques that resulted in huge payouts\nestimated at US$500 million as of November 2021. In concerted efforts to dismantle ransomware cartels, a global coalition across five\n[continents that involved law enforcement and private partners led to the arrests in Ukraine of six suspected Clop members in June 2021.](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/k/global-operations-lead-to-arrests-of-alleged-members-of-gandcrab.html)\n\nWhile the arrests in Ukraine might have dealt a big blow to Clop’s operations, the group’s criminal activities have gone unabated: Our\n[detections of attack attempts showed non-stop malicious activities from January 2021 to January 2022. Reports mentioned that only parts of](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/clop-ransomware-is-back-in-business-after-recent-arrests/)\nthe ransomware’s operations, such as the server infrastructure used by affiliates to disseminate the malware and the channels used to launder\ncryptocurrency ransom payments that were illegally obtained, were seized and taken down, respectively.\n\nAs enterprises ponder on ways to bolster their security defenses in the post-pandemic era, learning more about potential threats is essential to\nadopting a proactive cybersecurity approach. In this report, we focus the spotlight on the notorious Clop ransomware’s operations.\n\n## History of Clop\n\n[Clop evolved as a variant of the CryptoMix ransomware family. In February 2019, security researchers discovered the use of Clop by the threat](https://www.webroot.com/blog/2016/07/22/about-cryptomix-ransomware/)\n[group known as TA505 when it launched a large-scale spear-phishing email campaign. Clop is an example of ransomware as a service](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tr/security/definition/spear-phishing)\n[(RaaS) that is operated by a Russian-speaking group. Additionally, this ransomware used a verified and digitally signed binary, which made it](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/cl0p-ransomware-gang-tries-to-topple-the-house-of-cards)\nlook like a legitimate executable file that could evade security detection.\n\nIn 2020, it was reported that FIN11 — a financially motivated hacking group — deployed Clop ransomware and threatened their victims to\n[publish exfiltrated data. FIN11 exploited zero-day vulnerabilities in the legacy file transfer appliance (FTA) of Kiteworks (formerly known as](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tr/security/definition/zero-day-vulnerability)\nAccellion) to infiltrate the network of the victims. It then aimed to deliver the Clop ransomware as its payload and steal data as well.\n[Researchers also discovered that the group used a specific web shell that was referred to as “DEWMODE” to exfiltrate stolen information from](https://success.trendmicro.com/solution/000283514)\nits victims.\n\nResearchers found two groups of malicious actors that have known connections to FIN11 and identified them as UNCA2546 and UNCA2582.\n[These were also the groups responsible for the massive attacks on Kiteworks users.](https://www.kiteworks.com/sites/default/files/resources/accellion-company-overview.pdf)\n\n[The operators behind Clop made their first attempt at using the double extortion scheme in April 2020 when they publicized the data of](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tr/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/ransomware-double-extortion-and-beyond-revil-clop-and-conti)\na [pharmaceutical company on their leak site. Clop’s dedicated leak site hosts its list of victims, which has markedly grown since its launch.](https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/27/execupharm-clop-ransomware/)\nOver time, the gang’s extortion tactics have become more sophisticated and thus more destructive.\n\n[In November 2021, security researchers detected malicious activity by Clop operators that exploited a SolarWinds Serv-U vulnerability to](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/clop-gang-exploiting-solarwinds-serv-u-flaw-in-ransomware-attacks/)\nbreach corporate networks and deliver the Clop ransomware as a payload. The Serv-U Managed File Transfer and Serv-U Secure FTP remote\n[code execution (RCE) vulnerability tracked as CVE-2021-35211 allowed RCE on the vulnerable server with elevated privileges](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-35211#:~:text=Microsoft%20discovered%20a%20remote%20code,machine%20hosting%20Serv%2DU%20Only.)\n\n\n-----\n\na t e se ces g a t t eadqua te s S gapo e a so e p ey to C op o e be 0, t as epo ted t at C op b eac ed ts\nsystems to steal classified proprietary commercial information and employee data that included bank account details, payroll information,\npassports, email addresses, and internal correspondence, among others.\n\n## An overview of Clop operations\n\nThe Clop ransomware appends the “.ClOP” (“Clop” spelled with a small “L”) extension to the files it encrypts. Researchers also discovered that\nClop targets a victim’s entire network instead of just individual computers. This is made possible by hacking into the Active Directory (AD)\nserver before the ransomware infection to determine the system’s Group Policy. This allows the ransomware to persist in the endpoints even\nafter incident responders have already cleaned them up.\n\n[Previous attacks by the TA505 group saw the delivery of the Clop malware as the final stage of its payload in massive phishing campaigns.](https://www.hornetsecurity.com/en/security-information/clop-clop-ta505-html-malspam-analysis/?_adin=11551547647)\nThe malicious actors would send spam emails with HTML attachments that would redirect recipients to a macro-enabled document such as an\n[XLS file used to drop a loader named Get2. This loader facilitates the download of various tools such as SDBOT,](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/threat-encyclopedia/malware/SDBOT/) [FlawedAmmyy, and](https://success.trendmicro.com/solution/1123301-flawedammyy-malware-information#:~:text=FlawedAmmyy%20is%20a%20remote%20access,on%20leaked%20Ammyy%20Admin%20software.&text=Upon%20infection%2C%20the%20RAT%20can,Capture%20screenshots) Cobalt\nStrike. Once the malicious actors intrude into the system, they proceed to reconnaissance, lateral movement, and exfiltration to set the stage\nfor deployment of the Clop ransomware.\n\nThe operators behind Clop coerce their victims by sending out emails in a bid for negotiations. They also resort to more severe threats such as\npublicizing and auctioning off the stolen information on their data leak site “Cl0p^_-Leaks” if their messages are ignored. They have also gone\nto the extent of using [quadruple extortion techniques, which have involved going after top executives and](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/ransomware-double-extortion-and-beyond-revil-clop-and-conti) [customers to pressure companies](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/116029/cyber-crime/clop-ransomware-extortion.html)\ninto settling the ransom.\n\nHaving established itself well in the world of cybercrime, the Clop ransomware gang is deemed as a trendsetter for its ever-changing tactics,\ntechniques, and procedures (TTPs). Indeed, the group’s Kiteworks FTA exploits set a new trend as these significantly pulled up the average\nransom payments for the first quarter of 2021. A [report that cited Coveware’s findings revealed that the average ransomware payments](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/accellion-data-breaches-drive-up-average-ransom-price/)\nsignificantly went up to US$220,298, which is an increase of 43%. It also said that the median ransom payment increased sharply to\nUS$78,398 from US$49,459, which translates to a 60% hike.\n\n## Top affected countries and industries\n\nIn this section, we discuss Trend Micro™ Smart Protection Network™ (SPN) data on detections of Clop attempts to compromise organizations.\nOur detections reveal that the US had the largest number of attack attempts at 2,214 followed by Spain at a distant second with 505 attempts.\nThe rest of the detections are spread across North America, South America, Asia Pacific, Europe, and the Middle East.\n\nFigure 1. 10 countries with the highest number of attack attempts per machine for the Clop ransomware (January 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022)\n\nWhile other known RaaS operators claim to avoid the healthcare sector as a target out of humanitarian consideration, our detections reveal\nthat this is not the case for Clop, as this sector received the highest number of detections at 959, followed by the financial industry at 150.\nFigure 2 shows the breakdown of detections according to industry.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2. 10 industries with the highest number of attack attempts per machine for the Clop ransomware (January 1, 2021 to January 31,\n2022)\n\n_Source: Trend Micro Smart Protection Network infrastructure_\n\nBy breaking down the detections per month, we are able to determine that 2021 saw the peak of Clop attacks in June of the same year at 784\nattack attempts. March also saw a steep rise in attempts at 663, which was significantly higher than the detections in prior months. Our\ndetections suggest that Clop operations have remained robust as numbers consistently straddled the 300 to 400 range from July 2021 to\nJanuary 2022.\n\nFigure 3. Monthly breakdown of detections per machine for the Clop ransomware (January 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022)\n\n_Source: Trend Micro Smart Protection Network infrastructure_\n\nWe also looked into Clop’s leak site to gain insights into the operators’ successful attacks from December 16, 2021 to January 15, 2022.\nDuring this period, only two organizations — both small businesses — were successfully compromised by Clop operators. One organization\nbelongs to the legal sector, while the other belongs to the fashion and apparel sector. Both organizations are based in North America, and as\nobserved in the aforementioned period, have yet to pay ransom.\n\n## Infection chain and techniques\n\nThe Clop ransomware that TA505 first distributed evaded detection by using a binary that was digitally signed and verified to make it seem like\na legitimate executable file. The group launched a large volume of spear-phishing emails that were sent to the employees of an organization to\ntrigger the infection process. Figure 4 shows the infection chain.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4. The first infection chain of TA505\n\nIn January 2020, TA505 changed the flow of infection by using SDBOT alone to collect and exfiltrate data to the command-and-control (C&C;)\nserver. Figure 5 shows the modified infection chain.\n\nFigure 5. The modified infection chain of TA505\n\nFigure 6. The infection chain of FIN11\n\nFigure 6 shows the infection chain of FIN11’s exploit of the multiple zero-day vulnerabilities in Kiteworks’ FTA so that it could install a newly\ndiscovered web shell, DEWMODE. FIN11 then used this same web shell to exfiltrate data from the FTA and deliver the Clop ransomware as a\npayload.\n\n**Initial Access**\n\n\n-----\n\ne t eat acto s be d t e C op a so a e use a estab s ed et o o a ates to ga t a access a d se d a a ge o u e o spea\nphishing emails to employees of an organization to induce infection. The malicious actors use a compromised RDP to penetrate the system\neither by attempting to brute-force passwords or by exploiting some known vulnerabilities. The following are the Kiteworks FTA zero-day\nexploits that they used in early 2021:\n\nCVE-2021-27101 – SQL injection via a crafted host header\nCVE-2021-27102 – Operating system command execution via a local web service call\nCVE-2021-27103 – SSRF via a crafted POST request\nCVE-2021-27104 – Operating system command execution via a crafted POST request\n\nThe ransomware group was reported to have exploited the SolarWinds Serv-U product vulnerability tagged as CVE-2021-35211.\n\n**Discovery**\n\nClop’s ransomware toolkit contained several malware types to harvest information:\n\nFlawedAmmyy remote access trojan (RAT) collects information and attempts to communicate with the C&C; server to enable the\ndownload of additional malware components.\nAfter getting through the AD server, it will download an additional hacking tool, Cobalt Strike.\nSDBOT, another RAT, propagates the infection in many ways, including exploiting vulnerabilities and dropping copies of itself in\nremovable drives and network shares. It is also capable of propagating when shared through peer-to-peer (P2P) networks. Malicious\nactors use SDBOT as a backdoor to enable other commands and functions to be executed in the compromised computer.\n\n**Lateral Movement, Discovery, and Defense Evasion**\n\nAt this stage, the malware scans for the workgroup information of the machine to distinguish personal machines from enterprise ones. If the\nworkgroup is the default by value, the malware will stop malicious behavior and delete itself. If the AD server domain is returned, a machine\n[gets classified as a corporate machine. The malware attempts to hack the AD server using Server Message Block (SMB) vulnerabilities and](https://thehackernews.com/2020/06/SMBleed-smb-vulnerability.html)\nusing the added downloaded hacking tool Cobalt Strike. Cobalt Strike is a known tool for post-exploitation that has been previously connected\n[to other ransomware families. Meanwhile, TinyMet is used to connect the reverse shell to the C&C; server. The AD server admin account is](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/threat-encyclopedia/malware/hacktool.win32.tinymet.k/)\nused to propagate the Clop ransomware to internal network machines. As for SDBOT, it uses application shimming to preserve the continuity\nof the attack and to avoid detection.\n\n**Exfiltration**\n\nOne attack was observed as using DEWMODE to exfiltrate stolen data.\n\n**Impact**\n\nThe ransomware payload that terminates various Windows services and processes proceeds to its encryption routine.\n\n## MITRE tactics and techniques\n\n\n**Initial**\n**Access** **Execution** **Persistence**\n\n\n**Privilege**\n**Escalation** **Defense Evasion** **Discovery**\n\n\n**Lateral**\n**Movement** **Collection**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Initial**\n**Access** **Execution** **Persistence**\n\n\n**Privilege**\n**Escalation** **Defense Evasion** **Discovery**\n\n\n**Lateral**\n**Movement** **Collection**\n\n\n**T1566.001 -**\nPhishing:\nSpearphishing\nattachment\n\n_Arrives via_\n_phishing_\n_emails that_\n_have Get2_\n_Loader,_\n_which will_\n_download the_\n_SDBot and_\n_FlawedAmmy_\n_RAT_\n\n**T1190 -**\nExploit\npublic-facing\napplication\n\n_Arrives via_\n_any the_\n_following_\n_exploits:•_\n_CVE-2021-_\n_27101• CVE-_\n_2021-27102•_\n_CVE-2021-_\n_27103• CVE-_\n_2021-27104•_\n_CVE-2021-_\n_35211_\n\n**T1078 -

Moreover, the operators behind Clop are known to regularly change their TTPs, which\nmeans that expecting them to sharpen the proverbial saw is par for the course. It is therefore best to stay vigilant and armed with the\nknowledge that ransomware operators are always waiting for a chance to pounce on their next victim.\n\nTo protect systems against similar threats, organizations can establish security frameworks that allocate resources systematically for\nestablishing a strong defense strategy against ransomware.\n\nHere are some best practices that organizations can consider:\n\n**Audit and inventory**\n\nTake an inventory of assets and data.\nIdentify authorized and unauthorized devices and software.\nMake an audit of event and incident logs.\n\n**Configure and monitor**\n\nManage hardware and software configurations.\nGrant admin privileges and access only when necessary to an employee’s role.\nMonitor network ports, protocols, and services.\nActivate security configurations on network infrastructure devices such as firewalls and routers.\nEstablish a software allowlist that only executes legitimate applications.\n\n**Patch and update**\n\nConduct regular vulnerability assessments.\nPerform patching or virtual patching for operating systems and applications.\nUpdate software and applications to their latest versions.\nTo prevent attacks like the Kiteworks FTA exploits, update to and patch the latest version of the FTA to clear the zero-day vulnerabilities\nthat were released by the malicious actors and dedicated to the attack signatures.\n\n**Protect and recover**\n\n\n-----\n\nImplement data protection, backup, and recovery measures.\nEnable multifactor authentication (MFA).\n\n**Secure and defend**\n\nEmploy sandbox analysis to block malicious emails.\nDeploy the latest versions of security solutions to all layers of the system, including email, endpoint, web, and network.\nDetect early signs of an attack such as the presence of suspicious tools in the system.\nUse advanced detection technologies such as those powered by AI and machine learning.\n\n**Train and test**\n\nRegularly train and assess employees on security skills.\nConduct red-team exercises and penetration tests.\n\nA multilayered approach can help organizations guard the possible entry points into the system (endpoint, email, web, and network). Security\nsolutions that detect malicious components and suspicious behavior could also help protect enterprises.\n\n[Trend Micro Vision One™ provides multilayered protection and behavior detection, which helps block questionable behavior and tools](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/business/products/detection-response.html)\nearly on before the ransomware can do irreversible damage to the system.\n[Trend Micro Cloud One™ Workload Security protects systems against both known and unknown threats that exploit vulnerabilities.
