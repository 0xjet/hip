But we know this much: this attack constitutes a grave risk to\nour national security.\"\n\nHe also said that there is no evidence that the situation is \"under control,\" adding that\nDefense Department won't even brief him as the U.S. President-Elect \"on many things.\"\n\n[\"The Defense Department won't even brief us on many things,\" Biden said. \"I know of](https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1341470726037987330)\nnothing that suggests it's under control.\"\n\n\n-----\n\nWe can t let this go unanswered. That means making clear and publicly who is\nresponsible for the attack and taking meaningful steps to hold them in account. - Joe\nBiden\n\n## Trump downplayed the attack\n\nBiden stated that the hackers behind this ongoing compromise campaign were able to catch\nthe federal government off-guard and unprepared.\n\n\"Foreign actors have been working on this breach since late last year, at least last year,\nsetting the landscape to compromise our systems, scraping up sensitive information from our\nworld-class tech sector and from private businesses, and from US govt agencies,\" Biden\nsaid.\n\nHe highlighted the Trump administration's failure to prioritize cybersecurity by \"eliminating or\ndowngrading cyber-coordinators in both the White Hosue and at the State Department to\nfiring the Director of CISA.\"\n\n\"President Trump's irrational downplaying of the seriousness of this attack\" was also\nmentioned during the press conference.\n\nThe Cyber Hack is far greater in the Fake News Media than in actuality. I have been\nfully briefed and everything is well under control. Russia, Russia, Russia is the priority\nchant when anything happens because Lamestream is, for mostly financial reasons,\npetrified of....\n\n[— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 19, 2020](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1340333618691002368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nBiden urged the Trump admin to fast forward the attack's attribution since the \"assault\nhappened on Donald Trump's watch, when he wasn't watching.\"\n\nWhile initial indications from Attorney General William Barr and Secretary of State Mike\nPompeo suggest that Russia is behind the breach certainly fits Russia's long history of\nreckless cyber-disruptive activities as Biden explained.\n\n\"He still has the responsibility as a President to defend American interests for the next four\nweeks,\" Biden said. \"But rest assured that even if he does not take it seriously, I will!\"\n\nTune in as I deliver remarks ahead of the holiday.
