The gang was the first to introduce a double-extortion\nmodel in the cybercrime landscape at the end of 2019. At the end of 2019, the Maze\nransomware implemented data harvesting capabilities and started threatening the victims to\nrelease the stolen data for all those victims who refuse to pay the ransom.\n\nIn November 2020, the Maze ransomware operators announced that they have officially shut\ndown their operations and denied the creation of a cartel.\n\nMaze operation then rebranded in September as Egregor, but on February 2021 several\nmembers of the Egregor group were arrested in Ukraine.\n\nThe [Sekhmet operation was launched in March 2020 and it has some similarities with the](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/112399/cyber-crime/doppelpaymer-fbi-alert.html)\nabove ransomware operations.\n\nWhile TTP’s of Egregor operators are almost identical to that of ProLock, the analysis of\nEgregor ransomware sample obtained during an incident response conducted by Group-IB\n[revealed that the executable code of Egregor is very similar to Sekhmet. The two strains](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/111197/cyber-crime/qakbot-egregor-ransomware.html)\nshare some core features, use similar obfuscation technique. Egregor source code bears\nsimilarities with Maze ransomware as well.\n\n[Now the decryption keys for these operations have now been leaked in the](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/t/768330/leak-maze-egregor-sekhmet-keys-along-with-m0yv-expiro-source-code/)\n[BleepingComputer forums. The keys were shared by a user named ‘Topleak’ who claims to](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/t/768330/leak-maze-egregor-sekhmet-keys-along-with-m0yv-expiro-source-code/)\nbe the developer for all three operations.\n\n_“Hello, It’s developer. It was decided to release keys to the public for Egregor, Maze,_\n_Sekhmet ransomware families. also there is a little bit harmless source code of polymorphic_\n_x86/x64 modular EPO file infector m0yv detected in the wild as Win64/Expiro virus, but it is_\n\n\n-----\n\n_not expiro actually, but AV engines detect it like this, so no single thing in common with_\n_gazavat.”_ _[the user wrote on the forum.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/t/768330/leak-maze-egregor-sekhmet-keys-along-with-m0yv-expiro-source-code/)_\n\n_“Each archive with keys have corresponding keys inside the numeric folders which equal to_\n_advert id in the config. In the “OLD” folder of maze leak is keys for it’s old version with e-mail_\n_based. Consider to make decryptor first for this one, because there were too many regular_\n_PC users for this version. Enjoy!”_\n\nTopLeak user pointed out that it is a planned leak, and is not linked to recent arrests and\ntakedowns conducted by law enforcement. The alleged ransomware developer added that\nnone of the ransomware gang will ever return in ransomware operation and that the source\ncode of tools ever made is wiped out.\n\nIn one of the archives leaked by the user there is the source code for a malware dubbed\n‘M0yv’ that was part of the gang’s arsenal.\n\n[Source Bleeping Computer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-dev-releases-egregor-maze-master-decryption-keys/)\n[The popular malware researchers Michael Gillespie and](https://twitter.com/demonslay335) [Fabian Wosar confirmed to](https://twitter.com/fwosar)\nBleepingComputer that they are decryption keys are legitimate and allow to decrypt files\nencrypted by the three ransomware families for free.\n\nEmsisoft has [released a decryptor a free decryption tool for the Maze, Egregor, and Sekhmet](https://www.emsisoft.com/ransomware-decryption-tools/maze-sekhmet-egregor)\nransomware.\n\n**[Pierluigi Paganini](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/pierluigi-paganini/b/742/559)**\n\n\n-----\n\n**[(SecurityAffairs –](http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/)** **hacking, Maze ransomware)**\n\nYou might also like\n\n**[Experts believe that Russian Gamaredon APT could fuel a new round of DDoS attacks](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/131762/apt/gamaredon-apt-ddos-attacks.html)**\n\nMay 28, 2022 By [Pierluigi Paganini](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip)\n\n\n-----\n\n**[The strange link between Industrial Spy and the Cuba ransomware operation](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/131754/cyber-crime/industrial-spy-cuba-ransomware.html)**\n\nMay 28, 2022 By [Pierluigi Paganini](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip)\n\nCopyright 2021 Security Affairs by Pierluigi Paganini All Right Reserved.\nBack to top\n\n[Home](http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/)\n[Cyber Crime](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/cyber-crime)\n[Cyber warfare](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/cyber-warfare-2)\n[APT](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/apt)\n[Data Breach](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/data-breach)\n[Deep Web](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/deep-web)\n[Digital ID](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/digital-id)\n[Hacking](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/hacking)\n[Hacktivism](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/hacktivism)\n[Intelligence](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/intelligence)\n[Internet of Things](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/iot)\n[Laws and regulations](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/laws-and-regulations)\n[Malware](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/malware)\n[Mobile](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/mobile-2)\n[Reports](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/reports)\n[Security](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/security)\n[Social Networks](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/social-networks)\n[Terrorism](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/terrorism)\n[ICS-SCADA](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/category/ics-scada)\n[EXTENDED COOKIE POLICY](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/extended-cookie-policy)\n[Contact me](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/contact)\n\n\n-----",
