In one example we found 5\nbenign attachments and a dropper link within the templated portion of the email.\"\n\n[breaking #emotet news

reports, invoices, employment opportunities, and shipping information — through\n[all its server clusters starting with July 17, after more than five months of inactivity.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/emotet-spam-trojan-surges-back-to-life-after-5-months-of-silence/)\n\n\"Since reemerging on July 17, Emotet has sustained its activities with daily spam runs\nspewing more than 500K emails every day (except weekends) starting at around 2:00 AM\nPacific Time (UTC -7),\" Microsoft [said.](https://twitter.com/MsftSecIntel/status/1288585098602803200)\n\nAfter returning back to life, Emotet first started [installing the TrickBot trojan on compromised](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/emotet-trickbot-malware-duo-is-back-infecting-windows-machines/)\n[Windows computers, later to switch to once again heavily spreading QakBot malware, fully](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/emotet-botnet-is-now-heavily-spreading-qakbot-malware/)\nreplacing the TrickBot payloads.\n\nAt the moment, there is no exact info on QakBot's final payloads but reports say that it will\ndeploy ProLock ransomware on some of the systems initially infected with Emotet.\n\n**Emotet's attachment stealer module (James Quinn)**\n\n## Most prevalent malware of the week\n\nIn a warning issued by the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) about the dangers\nposed by Emotet attacks, the malware is described as providing attackers \"with a foothold in\na network from which additional attacks can be performed, often leading to further\ncompromise through the deployment of ransomware.\"\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) also issued a warning on\n[targeted Emotet attacks earlier this year, advising admins and users to review its Emotet](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/current-activity/2020/01/22/increased-emotet-malware-activity)\nMalware alert for guidance.\n\nEmotet spreads using spam emails containing malicious URLs and attachments (Word or\nExcel documents designed to use macros) for downloading and installing the Emotet Trojan\non victims' computers, which will then download other malware over time and will also use\nthe infected device to send more spam emails.\n\nSince the botnet was revived on July 17th, it started delivering massive amounts of Emotet\nmalware payloads as part of campaign of malicious emails targeting users worldwide.\n\nThis huge spike of activity was behind Emotet being ranked first in a list of top 10 malware\n[strains analyzed on the interactive malware analysis platform Any.Run during the last week,](https://twitter.com/anyrun_app/status/1209006502104752128)\nhead and shoulders above the next malware in the top (the njRAT Remote Access Trojan),\nwith more than double
