We provided further intelligence and](http://www.talent-jump.com/article/2020/02/17/CLAMBLING-A-New-Backdoor-Base-On-Dropbox-en/)\nanalysis on the backdoor, which we learned was being used by an advanced persistent\nthreat (APT) actor that we dubbed \"DRBControl.\" The threat actor is currently targeting users\nin Southeast Asia, particularly gambling and betting companies. Europe and the Middle East\nwere also reported to us as being targeted, but we could not confirm this at the time of\nwriting. Exfiltrated data was mostly comprised of databases and source codes, which led us\nto believe that the group's main purpose is cyberespionage.\n\nThe campaign uses two previously unidentified backdoors. Known malware families such as\n[PlugX and the](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0013/) [HyperBro backdoor, as well as custom post-exploitation tools were also found](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0398/)\nin the attacker's arsenal. Interestingly, one of the backdoors used file hosting service\nDropbox as its command-and-control (C&C) channel. We disclosed our findings to Dropbox,\nwhich expired the tokens used in the campaign in August 2019 and has since been working\nwith Trend Micro on the issues.\n\n\n-----\n\n## OPERATION DRBCONTROL\n\nA newly identified threat actor behind a cyberespionage campaign targets gambling and\nbetting entities by using publicly available and custom tools to elevate privileges and perform\nlateral movements. One of the deployed malware uses Dropbox as a way to communicate\nand exfiltrate data from targets.\n\n### Targets\n\nDRBControl targets gambling and betting operations in Southeast Asia.\n\nGAMBLING\n\nBETTING\nThe threat actors behind the campaign use a variety of post-exploitation tools, such as a\nclipboard stealer, network traffic tunnel, brute-force tool, and password dumpers.\n\n### Operations\n\nThe first-stage intrusion uses spear-phishing .DOCX files. DRBControl distributes three\nversions of the infecting documents.\n\nThe campaign primarily takes advantage of two backdoors, both of which use DLL\nside-loading through the Microsoft-signed MSMpEng.exe file.\nThe type 1 backdoor already has nine versions, all developed between May to October\n2019. All versions use the file hosting service Dropbox as their C&C channel.\nThe type 2 backdoor uses a configuration file that has the C&C domain and connection\nport, as well as the directory and filename where the malware is copied. The file also\nsets its persistence mechanism.\nIn most cases, IP addresses could be resolved only for subdomains hardcoded in\nmalware samples; no IP address was linked to the domain names themselves.\nKnown malware families (e.g., PlugX RAT, Trochilus RAT, and HyperBro backdoor) and\nsoftware Cobalt Strike were also utilized in the campaign.\n\n### Network Activities\n\n Connections with Other APT Campaigns\n\n[Different malware identified with Winnti and](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cyber-attacks/winnti-group-resurfaces-with-portreuse-backdoor-now-engages-in-illicit-cryptocurrency-mining) [Emissary Panda campaigns. Links to the Winnti](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0027/)\ngroup range from mutexes to domain names and issued commands. The HyperBro\nbackdoor, which appears to be exclusive to Emissary Panda, was also used in this\ncampaign.\n\n### Key Findings:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe DRBControl campaign attacks its targets using a variety of malware and techniques that\ncoincide with those used in other known cyberespionage campaigns. The threat actors\nmaintain a diverse infrastructure and take advantage of post-exploitation tools to further their\noperations.\n\nThe campaign not only uses file hosting service Dropbox as its C&C channel, but also for the\ndelivery of different payloads. Dropbox repositories were also found to store information such\nas commands and post-exploitation tools, target user's workstation information, and stolen\nfiles.\n\nClipboard stealer\n\nEarthWorm network traffic tunnel\n\nPublic IP address retriever\n\nNBTScan tool\n\nBrute-force tool\n\nElevation of privilege vulnerability tool\n\nPassword dumpers\n\nUAC bypass tools\n\nElevation of privilege vulnerability tool\n\nPassword dumpers\n\nUAC bypass tools\n\nCode loaders\nPost-exploitation tools used by DRBControl\n\n## Conclusion\n\nUnlike largely indiscriminate attacks that focus on typical forms of cybercrime, targeted\nattacks differ in terms of how threat actors actively pursue and compromise specific targets\n(i.e., through spear phishing) for lateral movement in the network and sensitive information\nextraction. Understanding attack tools, techniques, and infrastructure, as well as the links to\nsimilar attack campaigns provides the context necessary to assess potential impact and\n\n\n-----\n\nadopt defensive measures. Trend Micro users can thwart advanced persistent threats with\nsecurity that provide actionable threat intelligence, network-wide visibility, and timely threat\nprotection.\n\nRead our detailed findings in our research paper, \"Uncovering DRBControl: Inside the\nCyberespionage Campaign Targeting Gambling Operations,\" which looks into the malware\nthat DRBControl uses, its relations to known APT groups, other noteworthy points of their\nactivities, and indicators of compromise.\n\n### MITRE ATT&CK Matrix\n\n\n-----\n\nDownload Uncovering DRBControl:\nInside the Cyberespionage Campaign Targeting Gambling Operations\n\nHIDE\n\n**Like it?
