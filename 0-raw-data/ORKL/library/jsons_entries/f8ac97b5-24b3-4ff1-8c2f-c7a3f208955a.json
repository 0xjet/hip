Since we\npublished an analysis of the malware and the profile of the threat actor advertising Aurora on underground forums for our clients, the botnet’s\nactivity slowed down.\n\nSince September 2022, Aurora malware is advertised as an infostealer and several traffers teams announced they added it to their malware\ntoolset. Furthermore, SEKOIA.IO observed an increase in the number of Aurora samples distributed in the wild, as well as C2 servers.\n\nAs the Aurora malware is widespread, not well detected, or publicly documented either, SEKOIA.IO analysed Aurora in depth and share the\nresults of our investigation in this article.\n\n## Context\n\n The evolution from botnet to stealer\n\n\n-----\n\nFirst advertised on Russian-speaking underground forums in April 2022, Aurora is a multi-purpose botnet with stealing, downloading and\nremote access capabilities. The botnet was sold as a Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) by a threat actor going by the handle Cheshire.\n\nIn July 2022, we identified around 50 samples, the majority of which belonging to the “Cheshire” and “Zelizzard” botnets, and less than a\ndozen C2 servers associated with Aurora botnets. In late July, the Aurora servers were no longer active, and no more recent Aurora samples\nwere submitted on an online public repository. At the time, SEKOIA.IO assessed that the activity of Aurora botnets was near at standstill.\nAdditionally, the presumed developer stopped publishing about Aurora botnet on Dark Web forums and on its Telegram channel at the\nbeginning of June 2022. Another publication on BHF forum in late July 2022 suggested that Cheshire developers shifted to developing\nmalware on demand. Based on these observations, we assess it is possible that the Aurora Botnet MaaS development is now abandoned.\n\nIn late August 2022, Aurora was advertised as a stealer instead of a botnet on Telegram and underground forums.\n\n_Figure 1. Advertisement for Aurora stealer on XSS forum (English version), published by KO7MO on September 8, 2022_\n\n## A popular stealer in the traffers landscape\n\nBased on the Dark Web cybercrime forums, SEKOIA.IO identified 9 traffers teams that announced they added Aurora in their infostealer\narsenal. Most of them created their team after the advertisement of Aurora as a stealer, and are still very active.\n\n**Traffers Team** **Malware arsenal** **Launch date** **Last observed activity**\n\nSpaceTeam Aurora 18/11/2022 25/11/2022\n\nBrazzzersLogs Aurora, Raccoon 14/11/2022 14/11/2022\n\nDevilsTraff Aurora, Raccoon 30/10/2022 14/11/2022\n\nBartLogs Aurora 25/10/2022 25/10/2022\n\nRavenLogs Aurora, Redline 17/10/2022 24/11/2022\n\nGfbg6 Aurora 14/09/2022 24/10/2022\n\nSAKURA Aurora 10/08/2022 04/11/2022\n\nHellRide Aurora 09/07/2022 21/11/2022\n\nYungRussia Aurora 05/04/2022 31/10/2022\n\n_Table 1.

Based on the illustration promoting their team, the threat group rates Raccoon stealer and Aurora equally.\n\n_Figure 2. Advertisement aiming at recruiting traffers in BrazzzersLogs Team and rating Raccoon and Aurora stealer (Source: Lolz Guru forum)_\n\nThe adoption of Aurora stealer by several traffers teams suggests that the malware gained in popularity among threat actors.\n\nIn October and November 2022, several hundreds of collected samples and dozens of active C2 servers contributed to confirm SEKOIA.IO\nprevious assessment that Aurora stealer would become a prevalent infostealer. Additionally, SEKOIA.IO observed multiple chains of infection\nleading to the execution of Aurora stealer. These infection chains leveraged phishing pages impersonating download pages of legitimate\nsoftware, including cryptocurrency wallets or remote access tools, and the 911 method making use of YouTube videos and SEO-poised fake\ncracked software download websites. Analysis of two infection chains is provided in Annex 1.\n\nBased on these observations, we assess that several threat actors distribute Aurora Stealer, each with its own delivery techniques.\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\nAs previously introduced, Aurora is a Golang information stealer. Following is an overview of the Aurora stealer capabilities: data collection,\nexfiltration to its C2 server and load of the next-stage payload.\n\n## Data collection\n\n### Fingerprint\n\n[Aurora mainly uses the lxn/win library to interact with the Windows API, this library relies on Windows Management Instrumentation Command](http://github.com/lxn/win)\n(WMIC).\n\nTo fingerprint the host, Aurora executes three commands on the infected host:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n     c os get Capt o\n   wmic path win32_VideoController get name\n   wmic cpu get name\n\n```\n_Figure 3. Aurora commands executed on the infected host in SEKOIA.IO XDR_\n\nLike previously analysed stealers, Aurora also takes one screenshot of the infected host.\n\n### Data from browsers, extensions and applications\n\nTo collect information, Aurora targets multiple web browsers, as well as browser extensions including those managing cryptocurrency wallets\nand applications such as Telegram.\n\nTargeted extensions are listed in the sample, applications, web browsers are written in the sample (see Annex 2). The malware uses the\n[function walk of the built-in module path to loop over files and directories until it matches a filename or directory name of one of the targeted](https://pkg.go.dev/path/filepath#Walk)\napplications or extensions.\n\n### File grabber\n\nThe grabber configuration is simple, the stealer gathers a list of directories to search for files of interest.\n\n_Figure 4. Disassembly code of grabber functionality_\n\n## Command and Control communications\n\n### Canal, format and structure\n\nThe malware communicates using TCP connection on ports 8081 and 9865 – 8081 being the most widespread open port. Exfiltrated data are\nin JSON format.\n\nAll messages abide by the same structure, each keys are described below:\n\nBrowser: name of the browser where data was collected (ex: Mozilla, Chromium, etc.);\nCache: content of the stolen file encoded in base64;\nFileName: name of the stolen file (e.g. cookies.sqlite, Login Data);\nGRB: likely the grabber configuration. Of note, SEKOIA.IO only observed the value “null”;\n\n\n-----\n\no ost ge p t o at o, c ud g\nName: a random name defined by threat actor;\nBuildID: name of the build, the value often matches a threat actor’s Telegram account;\nOS: Windows version;\nHWID: hardware ID;\nGPU: graphical card information;\nCPU: CPU name and vendor;\nRAM: amount of memory;\nLocation: execution path of Aurora sample;\nScreen: size of the screen of the infected host;\nIP: expecting the IP address of the infected host but the value is always an empty string.\nMasterKey: encryption key used to read the data of the stolen file, for instance some browsers store the saved password encrypted;\nPath: always empty string;\nType: type of the exfiltrated data (Browser-Mozilla, Screenshot, etc.).\n\nHere is an example of the fingerprint data exfiltrated to the C2 Aurora Server:\n\n_Figure 5. Exfiltrated fingerprint data of infected host_\n\n### Exfiltrated data\n\nThe logic of Aurora in terms of network communication is straightforward, if a file name matches the stealer logic, the file is encoded in base64\nand sent to the C2, following the message structure detailed in the previous section.\n\n_Figure 6: Summary of network communication with the C2 of a host infected by Aurora_\n\nThe analysed stealer always exfiltrated the screenshot first, and then the stolen files.\n\n## Next-stage loading\n\nAurora’s promoter claims the stealer has a file grabber and a loader capabilities. During the investigation, only the loader capabilities were\nobserved (see Annex 1).\n\n[Aurora loader is straightforward, it downloads a remote payload using net_http_Get from the built-in library net/http, then the file is written on](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http)\nthe disk in the temporary directory with a random name. The stealer executes the next stage using the following PowerShell command:\n```\npowershell.exe start-process “C:\\Users\\Admin\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\oH7P8GCPXQ.exe”\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7. Disassembly code of the loader functionality_\n\n[Discover our CTI and XDR products](https://sekoia.io/en/contact/)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAurora is another infostealer targeting data from browsers, cryptocurrency wallets, local systems, and acting as a loader. Sold at a\nhigh price on market places, collected data is of particular interest to cybercriminals, allowing them to carry out follow-up lucrative\n**campaigns, including Big Game Hunting operations.**\n\nAs multiple threat actors, including traffers teams, added the malware to their arsenal, Aurora Stealer is becoming a prominent threat. As\nobserved by SEKOIA.IO, cybercriminal threat actors widely distribute it using multiple infection chains including phishing websites\nmasquerading legitimate ones, YouTube videos and fake “free software catalogue” websites.\n\nTo provide our customers with actionable intelligence, SEKOIA.IO analysts will continue to monitor emerging and prevalent infostealers,\nincluding Aurora.\n\n## Annex\n\n Annex 1 – Infection Chains\n\nHere are two infection chains distributing the Aurora stealer in the wild.\n\n### Cryptocurrency phishing site\n\nAurora stealer is distributed using a phishing site impersonating Exodus Wallet (cryptocurrency wallet) hosted on hxxps://mividajugosa[.]com/.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8. Phishing webpage impersonating the Exodus Wallet download page (mividajugosa[.]com)_\n\nClicking on the “Download” button at the top right initiates the download of a ZIP “ExodusWeb3.zip” (SHA256:\n_2e9dbda19d9c75a82dabac8ffba5ea76689ada81639867c41c395a29aeaba788) that contains the executable “ExodusWeb3.exe” (SHA256:_\n_9db1744112aea85c625cd046fc737bf28bef254bebfbf7123df6844f62167759) detected as Aurora stealer. It communicates to its C2 server on_\n_79.137.195[.]171:8081._\n\n### 911 infection chain\n\nThis infection consists in the following steps:\n\n1. A YouTube video on a stolen account describing how to install a cracked software for free and providing a link;\n\n\n-----\n\no t e p o ded t e ou ube deo, t e ct ca access a ee so t a e cata ogue ebs te (e g _so ts[ ]c oud);_\n\n_Figure 9. Fake free software catalogue website (winsoft[.]cloud) luring the user to download Aurora sample_\n\n3. The payload is hosted on a legitimate file sharing platform and embeds Aurora Stealer. The user downloads it, decompresses the archive\nand executes the file “setup.exe”.\n\n4. Aurora sample communicates to its C2 on 45.15.156[.]97:8081 and downloads a second-stage payload (oH7P8GCPXQ.exe).\n\nRelated URLs:\n\nYouTube videos: hxxps://www.youtube[.]com/watch?v=oy7NPaccBnk\nMalicious free software catalogue website: hxxps://winsofts[.]cloud/\nNext-stage payload: hxxps://cdn.discordapp[.]com/attachments/1037000444813254768/1042401882041237524/Adobe_Acrobat.zip\n\nFile hashes:\n\nDownloaded archive (Adobe_Acrobat.zip)\n\nSHA256: 88e02def17fda0021d4dba5ea812772c542b0fa6ca8930bcf06c42375c00bd29\nAurora sample (setup.exe)\n\nSHA256: 47332ce5b904b959aa814ddfde8662931fdfb5233422dc45053ad04cffc44fb4\nNext-stage payload (oH7P8GCPXQ.exe)\n\nSHA256: 8e24e96e1e87cf00e27c3a3745414636fbf6e148077c0f6815a2b87bacf85c8d\n\nEmulating this infection chain on a system monitored by SEKOIA.IO XDR resulted in raising 5 security alerts, as shown hereunder.\n\nThe CTI detection rule detected communications with the Aurora C2 server and the malicious domain hosting the fake free software\ncatalogue.\nThe correlation rule detected the sequence of Aurora fingerprinting commands using WMIC.\nOther generic detection rules detected the change in the Windows Defender configuration to exclude the location “C:\\Program Data\\” (via\nthe Windows Defender event ID 5007 and via the executed command line). This behaviour corresponds to the next-stage payload\ndropped by the Aurora sample.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 10.
