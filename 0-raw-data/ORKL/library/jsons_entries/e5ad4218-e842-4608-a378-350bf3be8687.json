This Chinese APT group is known within private\nsector reporting as APT10, Cloud Hopper, menuPass, Stone Panda, Red\nApollo, CVNX and POTASSIUM. This group heavily targets managed service\nproviders (MSP) who provide cloud computing services; commercial and\ngovernmental clients of MSPs; as well as defense contractors and\ngovernmental entities. APT10 uses various techniques for initial\ncompromise including spearphishing and malware. After initial compromise,\nthis group seeks MSP administrative credentials to pivot between MSP cloud\nnetworks and customer systems to steal data and maintain persistence.\nThis group has also used spearphishing to deliver malicious payloads and\ncompromise victims.\n\n\nThe following information is being provided by the FBI, with no guarantees\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition to and through cloud-computing MSPs, APT10 targets victims in\nthe following areas:\n\n\n\n  - Agriculture\n\n  - Automotive\n\n  - Defense contractors\n\n  - Electronics\n\n  - Energy\n\n  - Financial\n\n  - Government\n\n  - Human Resources\n\n  - Manufacturing\n\n  - Medical\n\n  - Military\n\n  - Mining\n\n  - Shipping\n\n  - Technology services\n\n  - Telecommunications\n\nAny activity related to APT10 detected on a network should be considered\nan indication of a compromise requiring extensive mitigation and contact\nwith law enforcement.\n\nThe FBI is providing the following information with **HIGH confidence:**\n\n### TECHINICAL DETAILS:\n\nAPT10 uses custom tools which should be immediately flagged if detected,\nreported to FBI CYWATCH, and given highest priority for enhanced\nmitigation. The presence of such tools is typically part of a comprehensive,\nmultifaceted effort to maintain persistent network access and exfiltrate\ndata. The custom tools used by this group are as follows:\n\n**REDLEAVES**\n\nThe REDLEAVES implant is a remote access Trojan (RAT) which\noperates largely in memory with functionality suitable for system\nenumeration and lateral movement within victim networks. Industry\nreporting provides REDLEAVES may be used in spearphishing\ncampaigns as an intrusion vector. REDLEAVES source code shares\n\n\n-----\n\ncommonalities with TROCHILUS RAT. Variants of REDLEAVES include\nHIMAWARI and LAVENDER malware.\n\nREDLEAVES comprises an executable file (EXE), custom loader (DLL)\nand an encoded data file (DAT) containing shellcode and the\nREDLEAVES DLL. Upon execution of the EXE file, the custom loader\nDLL is side-loaded and conducts a function call to load and decode an\nXOR encoded data file containing (a) stage-one shellcode, (b) stagetwo shellcode and (c) the REDLEAVES DLL. The stage-one shellcode\nlaunches “svchost.exe” to process hollow the stage-two shellcode;\nstage-two shellcode, in turn, allocates memory in “svchost.exe” to\nload REDLEAVES DLL. After the REDLEAVES DLL runs, the EXE file\nprocess terminates.\n\nREDLEAVES is able to utilize a named pipe to execute commands in\nremote shell or, alternatively, pass instructions through “cmd.exe” to\nexecute commands directly in the command shell. Basic REDLEAVES\nfunctionality includes victim system enumeration, file\nsearch/deletion, screenshots, as well as data transmission. Prior to\ntransmission, REDLEAVES compresses raw data with MiniLZO and\nencrypts said data with RC4 encryption. REDLEAVES is able to\ncommunicate with command and control (C2) servers on\nHTTP/HTTPS or custom TCP protocols across ports 53, 80, 443 and\n995.\n\nAlthough REDLEAVES operates in memory to avoid detection, early\nversions may not conduct anti-forensics; evidence, therefore, of files\ncopied to/from an infected host may still be present on disk. If a\nmachine is believed to be infected, it is recommended to examine for\n“svchost.exe” processes which do not have “services.exe” as parent;\n“svchost.exe” memory pages mapped as read-write-execute (RWX);\nas well as reviewing forensic memory capture for anomalies\ncommonly associated with malicious processes.\n\n**UPPERCUT/ANEL**\n\nUPPERCUT, also known as ANEL, is a backdoor Trojan used in\nspearphishing campaigns to deploy second-stage payloads such as\ncredential harvesters. Industry reporting states APT10 deploys\nUPPERCUT through decoy Word documents containing a malicious\nVisual Basic macro (VBA). UPPERCUT is known to exploit CVE-2017\n\ncommonalities with TROCHILUS RAT. Variants of REDLEAVES include\nHIMAWARI and LAVENDER malware.\n\n\n-----\n\n8759 and CVE-2017-1182. It may be detected by antivirus engines as\n“TROJ_ANELLDR”, “BKDR_ANELENC”,\n“APT.Backdoor.Win.UPPERCUT” and/or\n“FE_APT_Backdoor_Win32_UPPERCUT”.\n\nInstallation commences when the victim user enables the Word\ndocument macro, resulting in the download of three Privacy\nEnhanced Mail (PEM) text files. These PEM files are decoded with\n“certutil.exe” to produce an EXE, DLL and DAT containing shellcode\nand the UPPERCUT DLL. Upon execution of the EXE file, the custom\nloader DLL is side-loaded and conducts a function call to load and\ndecrypt the shellcode; the shellcode decodes and decompresses the\nUPPERCUT DLL. After the UPPERCUT DLL runs in memory, the PEM\nfiles are deleted with “esentutle.exe”.\n\nUPPERCUT is known to use Blowfish encryption when\ncommunicating with C2 servers. UPPERCUT communicates with C2\nservers through HTTP GET or POST requests. UPPERCUT initially\ncollects victim computer information, such as hostname and OS\nversion, and then aggregates and encrypts the data into a string\nembedded within the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) of HTTP\nrequests. Upon receiving an initial request, the C2 server will\nrespond with an HTTP status response; if no C2 response is given,\nUPPERCUT may resend the HTTP request with a “GetLastError” code\ncontained within the Cookie header. Subsequent commands and\nmodules between the C2 servers and UPPERCUT are Blowfish\nencrypted and then embedded within the body of HTTP requests or\nresponses. Basic functionality includes the ability to execute\ncommands, upload/download files, load executables and take\nscreenshots.\n\n**CHCHES**\n\nCHCHES, also known as CHINESE CHESS, is a RAT which\ncommunicates with C2 servers using HTTP Cookie headers. Industry\nreporting provides CHCHES may be used in spearphishing campaigns\nas an initial intrusion vector designed to deploy second-stage\npayloads. The CHCHES EXE is known to disguise itself with a Word\nicon or shortcut, as well as use expired or revoked certificates.\n\n\n8759 and CVE-2017-1182. It may be detected by antivirus engines as\n“TROJ_ANELLDR”, “BKDR_ANELENC”,\n\n\n-----\n\nCHCHES initially collects victim computer hostname; process\nidentifier (PID); current working directory (%TEMP%); screen\nresolution; as well as kernel32.dll or explorer.exe version. This data\nis aggregated into a string, encrypted and embedded within the\nCookie header of an HTTP GET or POST request and beaconed to a C2\nserver. The C2 server responds with a HTTP status response\ncontaining a unique identifier within the “Set-Cookie” tag. After a\nsecond HTTP GET beacon is sent containing the unique identifier\nencrypted and embedded within the Cookie header, the C2 server\nwill transmit modules and commands. CHCHES modules loaded onto\nmemory include the ability to execute commands, upload/download\nfiles, load and run DLLs, as well as encrypt communications using AES\nencryption.\n\nAPT10 also acquires legitimate credentials and uses commonly available\ntools as part of their effort to maintain persistent network access.\nMitigation efforts should also focus on identifying such access and removing\nit. FBI has identified the following specific, but not wholly exclusive,\nmalware and tools previously used by this group:\n\n  - QUASAR RAT\n\nPlease see APPENDIX A and APPENDIX B for technical indicators and\nindicators of compromise (IOCs) associated with this APT.\n\n\nCHCHES initially collects victim computer hostname; process\nidentifier (PID); current working directory (%TEMP%); screen\n\n\n-----\n\n### RECOMMENDED STEPS FOR INITIAL MITIGATION:\n\nThe FBI recommends the following mitigation measures be taken within the\nfirst 72 hours of detection:\n\n**Prepare Your Environment for Incident Response**\n\n  - Establish Out-of-Band Communications methods for dissemination of\n\nintrusion response plans and activities, inform network operations\ncenters (NOCs) and computer emergency response teams (CERTs)\naccording to institutional policy and SOPs\n\n  - Maintain and actively monitor centralized host and network logging\n\nsolutions after ensuring all devices have logging enabled and their\nlogs are being aggregated to those centralized solutions\n\n  - Disable all remote (including remote desktop protocol and virtual\n\nprivate network) access until a password change with two-factor\nauthentication has been completed\n\n  - Implement full secure socket layer (SSL) / transport layer security\n\n(TLS) inspection capability (on perimeter and proxy devices)\n\n  - Monitor accounts and devices determined to be part of the\n\ncompromise to prevent reacquisition attempts\n\n  - Collect forensic images including memory capture of devices\n\ndetermined to be part of the compromise.\n\n**Implement core mitigations to prevent re-exploitation (within 72 hours)**\n\n**Implement a network-wide password reset with two-factor authentication**\n**(preferably with local host access only, no remote changes allowed) to**\n**include:**\n\n  - All domain accounts (especially high-privileged administrators)\n\n  - Local Accounts\n\n  - Machine and System Accounts\n\n**Patch all systems for critical vulnerabilities:**\n\nA patch management process which regularly patches vulnerable software\nremains a critical component in raising the difficulty of intrusions for cyber\noperators. While a few adversaries use zero-day exploits to target victims,\nmany adversaries still target known vulnerabilities for which patches have\nbeen released, capitalizing on slow patch processes and risk decisions by\n\n\n### RECOMMENDED STEPS FOR INITIAL MITIGATION:\n\n\n-----\n\nnetwork owners not to patch certain vulnerabilities or systems. A few of\nthese targeted vulnerabilities include the following:\n\n  - CVE-2018-8477\n\n  - CVE-2018-8514\n\n  - CVE-2018-8580\n\n  - CVE-2018-8595\n\n  - CVE-2018-8596\n\n  - CVE-2018-8598\n\n  - CVE-2018-8616\n\n  - CVE-2018-8621\n\n  - CVE-2018-8622\n\n  - CVE-2018-8627\n\n  - CVE-2018-8637\n\n  - CVE-2018-8638\n\n  - CVE-2018-8373\n\n  - CVE-2018-8174\n\n  - CVE-2017-8759\n\n  - CVE-2017-1182\n\n  - CVE-2017-0199\n\nWhile watching for infections from the malware families detailed above, we\nalso recommend ensuring you are patched against older vulnerabilities\ncommonly exploited by cyber operators, such as CVE-2012-0158.\n\nAfter initial response activities, deploy and properly configure a mitigation\ntool kit such as Microsoft's Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET).\nEMET employs several mitigations techniques to combat memory corruption\ntechniques. It is recommended all hosts and servers on the network\nimplement mitigation toolkits.\n\n**DHS Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Mitigation**\n**Guidance:**\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure\nSecurity Agency (CISA) has multiple alerts and additional mitigation guidance\nrelated to this APT and managed service providers.
