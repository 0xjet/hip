    "plain_text": "# Onion Dog, A 3 Year Old APT Focused On the Energy and Transportation Industries in Korean-language Countries Is Exposed by 360\n\n**BEIJING, March 8, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- The Helios Team at 360 SkyEye Labs recently revealed that a**\n**hacker group named OnionDog has been infiltrating and stealing information from the energy,�**\n**transportation and other infrastructure industries of Korean-language countries through the Internet.**\n**According to big data correlation analysis, OnionDog's first activity can be traced back to October, 2013�**\n**and in the following two years it was only active between late July and early September. The self-set life**\n**cycle of a Trojan attack is 15 days on average and is distinctly organizational and objective-oriented.**\n\n**OnionDog malware is transmitted by taking advantage of the vulnerability of the popular office software�**\n**Hangul in Korean-language countries, and it attacked network-isolated targets through a USB Worm. In**\n**addition, OnionDog also used darkweb (\"Onion City\") communications tools, with which it can visit the**\n**domain without the Onion browser, making its real identity hidden in the completely anonymous Tor**\n**network.**\n\n**OnionDog APT targets the infrastructure industry.**\n\n**OnionDog concentrated its efforts on �infrastructure industries in Korean-language countries. In 2015 this**\n**organization mainly attacked harbors, VTS, subways, public transportation and other transportation**\n**systems. In 2014 it attacked many electric power and water resources corporations as well as other energy**\n**enterprises.**\n\n**360's Threat Intelligence Center has found 96 groups of malicious code, 14 C&C domain names and IP**\n**related to OnionDog. It first surfaced in �October 2013, and then was most active in the summers of the**\n**following years. The Trojan set its own \"active state\" time and the shortest was be three days and**\n**maximum twenty nine days, from compilation to the end of activity. The average life cycle is 15 days, which**\n**makes it more difficult for the victim enterprises to notice and take actions than those active for longer�**\n**period of time.**\n\n**Deadline** **_Compilation time_** **_Activate state (days)_**\n**Sep 8, 2015th** **Aug 27, 2015th** **12**\n**Aug 8, 2015th** **Aug 5, 2015th** **3**\n**Aug 8, 2015th** **Aug 3, 2015th** **5**\n**Aug 8, 2015th** **July 23, 2015th** **16**\n**Aug 8, 2015th** **July 10, 2015th** **29**\n**July 13, 2014th** **July 10, 2015th** **3**\n**Aug 9, 2014th** **July 18, 2014th** **22**\n**Aug 9, 2014th** **July 15, 2014th** **25**\n**July 13, 2014th** **July 13, 2014th** **18**\n**Oct 25, 2013** **Oct 10, 2013th** **15**\n\n**_The life cycle of Trojan malware_**\n\n**OnionDog's attacks are mainly carried out in the form of spear phishing emails. The early Trojan used icons**\n**and file numbers to create a fake HWP file (Hangul's file format). Later on, the Trojan used a vulnerability in�**\n**an upgraded version of Hangul, which imbeds malicious code in a real HWP file. Once the file is opened,�**\n**the vulnerability will be triggered to download and activate the Trojan**\n\n|Deadline|Compilation time|Activate state (days)|\n|---|---|---|\n|Sep 8 th, 2015|Aug 27 th, 2015|12|\n|Aug 8 th, 2015|Aug 5 th, 2015|3|\n|Aug 8 th, 2015|Aug 3 th, 2015|5|\n|Aug 8 th, 2015|July 23 th, 2015|16|\n|Aug 8 th, 2015|July 10 th, 2015|29|\n|July 13 th, 2014|July 10 th, 2015|3|\n|Aug 9 th, 2014|July 18 th, 2014|22|\n|Aug 9 th, 2014|July 15 th, 2014|25|\n|July 13 th, 2014|July 13 th, 2014|18|\n|Oct 25, 2013|Oct 10t h, 2013|15|\n\n\n-----\n\n**measures, OnionDog uses the USB disk drive ferry to break the false sense of security of physical**\n**isolation. In the classic APT case of the Stuxnet virus, which broke into an Iranian nuclear power plant, the**\n**virus used an employee's USB disk to circumvent network isolation. OnionDog also used this channel and**\n**generated USB worms to infiltrate the target internal network.�**\n\n**\"OCD-type\" intensive organization**\n\n**In the Malicious Code activities of OnionDog, there are strict regulations:**\n\n**First, the Malicious Code has strict naming rules starting from the path of created PDB (symbol file). For�**\n**example, the path for USB worm is APT-USB, and the path for spear mail file is APT-WebServer;�**\n\n**When the OnionDog Trojan is successfully released, it will communicate to a C&C (Trojan server), download**\n**other malware and save them in the %temp% folder and use \"XXX_YYY.jpg\" uniformly as the file name.�**\n**These names have their special meaning and usually point to the target.**\n\n**All signs show that OnionDog has strict organization and arrangement across its attack time, target,**\n**vulnerability exploration and utilization, and malicious code. At the same time, it is very cautious about**\n**covering up its tracks.**\n\n**In 2014, OnionDog used many fixed IPs in �South Korea as its C&C sites. Of course, this does not mean**\n**that the attacker is located in South Korea. These IPs could be used as puppets and jumping boards. By**\n**2015, OnionDog website communications were upgraded to Onion City across the board. This is so far a**\n**relatively more advanced and covert method of network communication among APT hacker attacks.**\n\n**Onion City means that the deep web searching engine uses Tor2web agent technology to visit the**\n**anonymous Tor network deeply without using the Onion Brower specifically. And OnionDog uses the Onion�**\n**City to hide the Trojan-controlling server in the Tor network.**\n\n**In recent years, APT attacks on infrastructure facilities and large-scale enterprises have frequently**\n**emerged. Some that attack an industrial control system, such as Stuxnet, Black Energy and so on, can**\n**have devastating results. Some attacks are for the purpose of stealing information, such as the Lazarus**\n**hacker organization jointly revealed by Kaspersky, AlienVault lab and Novetta, and OnionDog which was**\n**recently exposed by the 360 Helios team. These secret cybercrimes can cause similarly serious losses as**\n**well.**\n\n**In view of OnionDog's pattern of activity, we are likely to observe a new round of attacks this summer. The**\n**relevant threat intelligence and technical analysis report will be updated by 360's Intelligence Center**\n**[(https://ti.360.com).](https://ti.360.com/)**\n\n**About Helios Team**\n\n**Helios Team is a senior threat research team at Qihoo 360 that is engaged in detecting and tracing APT**\n**attacks, internet security incident response, hacker industrial chain exploration and study. The team was**\n**established in December 2014. Within a year, it integrated the enormous security data at Qihoo 360 and**\n**realized the rapid correlation traceability of threat intelligence, and for the first time found and traced 10�**\n**APT organizations and hacker industrial chains. It broadened its horizon to the study of the hacker industry,**\n**filled the void of APT study domestically and �has offered security threat evaluation and solutions output for�**\n**many enterprises and government agencies.**\n\n**SOURCE 360 SkyEye Labs**\n\n**See more news releases in** **[High Tech Security](http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/business-technology-latest-news/high-tech-security-list/)** **[Internet Technology](http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/business-technology-latest-news/internet-technology-list/)** **[Computer Electronics](http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/consumer-technology-latest-news/computer-electronics-list/)**\n\n\n-----\n\n## Custom Packages\n\n**Browse our custom packages or build your own to meet your unique communications needs.**\n\n**Start today.**\n\n\n## PR Newswire Membership\n\n**[Fill out a PR Newswire membership form](https://account.prnewswire.com/OnlineMembershipFormStep1/)** **or contact us at (888) 776-0942.**\n\n\n## Learn about PR Newswire services\n\n**Request more information about PR Newswire products and services or call us at (888) 776-0942.**\n\n\n**[About PR Newswire](http://prnewswire.mediaroom.com/index.php)** **[Contact PR Newswire](http://www.prnewswire.com/contact-us)** **[PR Newswire's Terms of Use Apply](http://www.prnewswire.com/terms-of-use-apply.html)** **[Careers](http://prncareerroom.drivetheweb.com/)** **[Privacy](http://prnewswire.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=62)**\n\n**[Information Security Policy](http://www.prnewswire.com/prn-information-security-policy.html)** **[Site Map](http://www.prnewswire.com/sitemap/)** **[RSS Feeds](http://www.prnewswire.com/rss/)** **[Blog](http://www.prnewswire.com/blog/)**\n**Copyright © 2016 PR Newswire Association LLC.
