Releases\n[have been grouped in four rounds --Round 1 (620 million user records), Round 2 (127 million user records),](https://www.zdnet.com/article/127-million-user-records-from-8-companies-put-up-for-sale-on-the-dark-web/) [Round 3 (93 million user records),](https://www.zdnet.com/article/hacker-puts-up-for-sale-third-round-of-hacked-databases-on-the-dark-web/)\n[and Round 4 (26.5 million user records).](https://www.zdnet.com/article/round-4-hacker-returns-and-puts-26mil-user-records-for-sale-on-the-dark-web/)\n\n### Hacker releases Round 5\n\nLast week, the hacker notified ZDNet about his latest release --Round 5-- containing the data of 65.5 million users, which the hacker claims to\n[have taken from six companies: gaming platform Mindjolt, digital mall Wanelo, e-invitations and RSVP platform Evite, South Korean travel](http://www.mindjolt.com/)\ncompany [Yanolja, women's fashion store](https://www.yanolja.com/) [Moda Operandi, and Apple repair center iCracked.](https://www.modaoperandi.com/)\n\nWhile ZDNet has reached out for comment to each of the named businesses, most of the hacker's previous 38 victims have confirmed hacks,\nso this new batch of stolen data is also very likely to be authentic as well.\n\n\n-----\n\nGnosticplayers Round 5\n\n\nImage: ZDNet\n\n**Company** **DB size** **Price** **Content**\n\nMindjolt (gaming platform) 28 Mil ฿0.1008 email, full name, birth date, register date, gaming details, no password\n\nWanelo (digital mall) 23 Mil ฿0.159 email, username, password (3 million MD5 & the rest bcrypt)\n\nEvite (e-invitations platform) 10 Mil ฿0.2419 full name, country, email, IP address, password (cleartext)\n\nYanolja (South Korean hotel and travel) 1.5 Mil ฿0.1209 email, password (MD5)\n\nModa Operandi (women's fashion store) 1.5 Mil ฿0.1129 email, name, password (SHA1), user-agent, IP address, and more\n\niCracked (Apple device repair center) 1.5 Mil ฿0.1108 name, physical address, geo-location details, email, password, and more\n\n\n-----\n\nea a et ad s dec ded ast o t to s ut do t e [a](https://www.zdnet.com/article/top-dark-web-marketplace-will-shut-down-next-month/) etp ace o p 30, a d t a s t o use s to a co pet g s te a te be g\nbombarded by nearly non-stop DDoS attacks and ransom demands.\n\nIn an email to ZDNet, the hacker said he decided to put this data up for sale (for 0.8463 Bitcoin/~$4,350), regardless of the market's impending\nclosure.\n\n### The quest for one billion\n\nBut while many will believe the hacker is putting all this data on sale for selfish, and obvious monetary reasons, there is more to\nGnosticplayers' actions than most people are aware.\n\nIn an interview with ZDNet after the release of Round 3 in February, the hacker was very candid about the reasons behind his sudden\nappearance in the public's eye.\n\nHackers like Gnosticplayers are part of small underground communities of hackers and data hoarders. They hack companies, steal their data,\nand then sell it to vetted partners.\n\nThis data is filtered and organized in various categories. Stolen email addresses are sold to spam botnets. Financial details are sold to groups\nspecialized in online fraud or tax scams. Usernames and cracked passwords are sold to botnet operators specialized in credentials stuffing\nattacks.\n\nThis is a lucrative business, and many of these hackers don't have to sell their data on public marketplaces like Dream Market.\n\nWe say \"public\" because despite being hosted on the dark web, Dream Market is a very very public space, littered with law enforcement,\njournalists, and employees of many cyber-security firms.\n\nAnyone selling data in such a public space is, without a doubt, looking for trouble and putting a bullseye on his back.\n\nBut according to Gnosticplayers, his foray into a public marketplace like Dream has two goals --besides the first and obvious one being money.\n\n## See als\n\n[10 dangerous app vulnerabilities to watch out for (free PDF)](https://www.techrepublic.com/resource-library/whitepapers/10-dangerous-app-vulnerabilities-to-watch-out-for-free-pdf/?ftag=CMG-01-10aaa1b)\n\n### Peace's long shadow\n\nIt's about reputation, the hacker told us in February. Gnosticplayers wants to be remembered in the same way hackers like Peace_of_Mind (or\nPeace) are remembered today.\n\nThroughout 2016, Peace has grabbed headlines all over the world by putting for sale over 800 million user records on the now-defunct\nTheRealDeal marketplace, and other places. He's known for selling data from companies such as LinkedIn (167 million), MySpace (360\nmillion), Tumblr (68 million), VK.com (100 million), Twitter (71 million), and many others.\n\nThe data that Peace was selling in 2016 was eventually released in the public domain and is now available in many places. Peace's original\nleaks are what made credentials stuffing attacks such dangerous threat today. His initial leaks are what have powered credential stuffing\nbotnets for the past few years.\n\nWith over 932 million records already available for sale on Dream, Gnosticplayers' data hovers dangerously above all our heads, as it could\ngreatly increase the capabilities of existing credentials stuffing botnets with new login combinations.\n\nFurthermore, while it was initially pretty well contained, many of the databases that Gnosticplayers has advertised on Dream are now slowly\nentering the public domain, similar to how Peace's original data eventually leaked as well.\n\nSome have ridiculed Gnosticplayers for selling data from small-time sites, with very few high-profile names when compared to Peace's list of\nhacked sites, but Gnostic's data should not be ignored, mainly due to its sheer size and everyone's penchant for reusing passwords.\n\n**Data leaks: The most common sources**\n\n### More data breach coverage:\n\n\n-----",
