In the interest of\n\nhighlighting a developing threat, this post analyzes the attack and provides a list of Indicators of Compromise.\n\n**A Syrian citizen media group critical of Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) was recently targeted in a**\n\n**customized digital attack designed to unmask their location. The Syrian group, Raqqah is being Slaughtered**\n\nSilently (RSS), focuses its advocacy on documenting human rights abuses by ISIS elements occupying the city of Ar\nRaqah. In response, ISIS forces in the city have reportedly targeted the group with house raids, kidnappings, and an\n\nalleged assassination. The group also faces online threats from ISIS and its supporters, including taunts that ISIS is spying\n\non the group.\n\n**Though we are unable to conclusively attribute the attack to ISIS or its supporters, a link to ISIS is**\n\n**plausible. The malware used in the attack differs substantially from campaigns linked to the Syrian**\n\n**regime, and the attack is focused against a group that is an active target of ISIS forces.**\n\n## Background: Citizen Journalists under Threat in ISIS-controlled Territories\n\nAs the Syrian Civil War continues, Syrian citizen journalists and nonviolent activists operate in an increasingly unsafe\n\nenvironment. The regime has never welcomed their work, and has often targeted them for arrest and detention, and a\n\nmulti-year hacking campaign (see Pro-Regime / Regime Linked Groups). Additionally, not all elements of the Syrian\n\nopposition have uniformly supported nonviolent activists and citizen journalists. More recently, in areas like Raqqah,\n\nnonviolent activists face a new and exceptionally grave threat: ISIS. A growing number of reports suggest that ISIS is\n\nsystematically targeting groups that document atrocities, or that communicate with Western media and aid organizations,\n\nsometimes under the pretext of finding “spies”.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Map: Raqqah is indicated by the red arrow. Colors indicate areas mostly under the control of the following groups:_\n\n_Black = ISIS, Red = Syrian Regime, Green = Free Syrian Army, Yellow = Kurdish. Note: the map is not highly detailed,_\n\n_[nor completely up-to-date, but is useful in showing general areas of control. Source: @DeSyracuse](https://twitter.com/desyracuse)_\n\nAr-Raqqah, the city in which the case study is located, is situated in northern Syria and continues to be a key conflict\n\nflashpoint of the Syrian Civil War. In the spring of 2013, Islamists and Free Syrian Army (FSA) fighters took over Ar\nRaqqah from regime forces. As ISIS gained momentum, they consolidated their control over the city, edging out FSA\naffiliated groups through attacks, summary executions, and kidnappings against a range of groups, including ethnic and\n\nreligious minorities.\n\n### Information Control by ISIS\n\nDuring 2014, there were a number of reports—many unconfirmed—that ISIS confiscated smartphones and laptops from\n\ncaptured activists. According to Syrians who experienced these searches and spoke with one of the reports’ authors, ISIS\n\nsometimes extracts data from confiscated smartphones and laptops to collect information about people and groups they\n\nare targeting, as well as to seek evidence of “un-Islamic” activities.\n\nAs ISIS cements their control of Ar-Raqqah and other territories, reports have emerged recently (though not all of them\n\nconfirmed) suggesting that elements within ISIS are growing increasingly sophisticated at imposing control and targeting\n\nopponents using digital methods. Reports about ISIS targeting Internet cafés have grown increasingly common, and in\n\nsome cases reports point to the possible use of keyloggers as well as unspecified “IP sniffers” to track behaviour in Internet\n\ncafes.\n\n### The Situation of Nonviolent Activists and Citizen Journalists in Ar-Raqqah\n\nNonviolent activists and citizen journalists based in Ar-Raqqah have provided the outside world with much of what we\n\nknow about how ISIS treats the population. These activists and journalists face mortal danger for their actions, and\n\nreports have emerged of their detention and torture at the hands of ISIS.\n\nAs ISIS continues to use social media to push the message that it is welcomed by the population of Ar-Raqqah, groups like\n\nRaqqah is being Slaughtered Silently (RSS) provide a compelling counter narrative RSS hasn’t escaped ISIS’ notice and\n\n\n-----\n\ng y g j qq\n\n_Image 1: Example of an online threat made against RSS. The image, which cannot be confirmed, purports to show CCTV_\n\n_installed around Raqqah._\n\nIn addition, RSS is targeted online by ISIS supporters with harassment, including threats to the physical safety of its\n\nmembers. For example, ISIS supporters have claimed that ISIS has established a system of CCTV cameras in Ar-Raqqah to\n\nobserve residents’ movements. While this claim may be a bluff or exaggeration, at least one ISIS supporter has indicated\n\non social media that this system could be used to look for members of RSS.\n\n## Analyzing the Attack\n\nThis section describes a highly targeted attack sent to an e-mail address belonging to RSS. The Citizen Lab analyzed this\n\nattack with the consent of RSS, which requested that their name be used in this report.\n\n**The attack took the form of an unsolicited e-mail containing a download link to a decoy file. The file**\n\n**contained custom malware that profiled the victim’s computer and beaconed its IP address to an e-mail**\n\n**account under the attacker’s control.**\n\n### The Targeting of RSS\n\nThe unsolicited message below was sent to RSS at the end of November 2014 from a Gmail email address. The message\n\nwas carefully worded, and contained references specific to the work and interests of RSS.\n\n**Targeting Email**\n\nThank o for o r efforts to deli er a tr e pict re of the realit of life in Raqqah As S rians residing in Canada e are\n\n\n-----\n\np p p g g y p qq g\n\nwith you with the hope that you will correct it in case it contains errors.

However, it is well known that Syria’s\n\nextensive diaspora (including in Canada) regularly engages in advocacy, sometimes in coordination with groups within\n\nSyria. Thus, the message is not on its face implausible. However, we note that the attacker also attempts to social\n\n**engineer the identity of individuals working with RSS, by requesting a personal Facebook page.**\n\n## Analyzing the Malware\n\nThe custom malware used in this attack infects a user who views the decoy “slideshow,” and beacons home with the IP\n\naddress of the victim’s computer and details about his or her system each time the computer restarts.\n\n**Unlike Syrian regime-linked malware, it contains no Remote Access Trojan (RAT) functionality,**\n\n**suggesting it is intended for identifying and locating a target.**\n\nFurther, because the malware sends data captured by the malware to an e-mail address, it does not require that the\n\nattackers maintain a command-and-control server online. This functionality would be especially useful to an adversary\n\nunsure of whether it can maintain uninterrupted Internet connectivity.\n\n### Narrative of Infection\n\nAccessing the link provided in the malicious e-mail sends the user to a .zip file hosted on file-sharing site\n\n**tempsend.com. At the time of writing the file had been downloaded only 10 times**\n\n\n-----\n\n_Image 2: Tempsend screenshot_\n\nThe file to be downloaded is “slideshow.zip”\n\nMD5: b72e6678e79cc57d33e684528b5721bd\n\nThis file contains slideshow.exe\n\nMD5: f8bfb82aa92ea6a8e4e0b378781b3859\n\nThis file is a self-extracting archive with an icon intended to suggest to the victim that it is itself a slideshow.\n\nWhen run, the file opens a slideshow of Google Earth screen captures to the victim, displaying a series of locations in\n\nSyria, and highlighting an “ISIS HQ” and other images showing the alleged locations of US airstrikes.\n\n**Examples of images in the slideshow as follows:**\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n## Infection and Data Collection\n\nWhen opened, the “slideshow.zip” file writes and executes several files:\n\nC:\\Users\\[Username]\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\IXP000.TMP\\AdobeR1.exe C:\\Users\\\n\n[Username]\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\IXP000.TMP\\pictures.exe\n\n“AdobeR1.exe” is malicious, while “pictures.exe” is the genuine slideshow displayed to the victim. When the slideshow is\n\nclosed both AdobeR1.exe and pictures.exe are deleted.\n\nThe AdobeR1 file writes a series of executable files that perform information collection and communication functions,\n\nincluding:\n\nC:\\Users\\[Username]\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Z0xapp8T.tmp\\AdbrRader.exe\n\nC:\\Users\\[Username]\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Z0xapp8T.tmp\\AdobeIns.exe\n\nC:\\Users\\[Username]\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Z0xapp8T.tmp\\GoogleUpate.exe\n\nC:\\Users\\[Username]\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Z0xapp8T.tmp\\GooglUpd.exe\n\nC:\\Users\\[Username]\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Z0xapp8T.tmp\\nvidrv.exe\n\nC:\\Users\\[Username]\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Z0xapp8T.tmp\\nvisdvr.exe\n\nC:\\Users\\[Username]\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Z0xapp8T.tmp\\rundl132.exe\n\nC:\\Users\\[Username]\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Z0xapp8T.tmp\\svhosts.exe\n\nC:\\Users\\[Username]\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Z0xapp8T.tmp\\nvidrv.exe\n\n### Program Sequence\n\nThe program sequence of data collection and sending is somewhat unusual, with each program performing a single task\n\nand communicating via markers left in the registry. Programs appear to make use of the Visual C++ Runtime Library.\n\nFirst, the program nvidrv adds itself to autorun:\n\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run under name “UpdAdbreader”\n\n\n-----\n\n**Registry keys and programs using them:**\n\n**rundl132.exe:**\n\nDefaultKeyboard\\User\\F124-5KK83-F2IV9-FDN293\\JIPC7-K2ODP-OFnD3-FJCC3\\J1K6F-DKV8J-FKVJI\nGVKBU\\6nvisdvr.exe:\n\nDefaultKeyboard\\User\\F124-5KK83-F2IV9-FDN293\\JIPC7-K2ODP-OFnD3-FJCC3\\J1K4F-DKV8J-FKVJI\nGVKBU\\4GoogleUpate.exe:\n\nDefaultKeyboard\\User\\F124-5KK83-F2IV9-FDN293\\JIPC7-K2ODP-OFnD3-FJCC3\\J1K3F-DKV8J-FKVJI\nGVKBU\\3AdbrRader.exe:\n\nDefaultKeyboard\\User\\F124-5KK83-F2IV9-FDN293\\JIPC7-K2ODP-OFnD3-FJCC3\\J1K2F-DKV8J-FKVJI\nGVKBU\\2nvidrv.exe:\n\nDefaultKeyboard\\User\\F124-5KK83-F2IV9-FDN293\\JIPC7-K2ODP-OFnD3-FJCC3\\J1K1F-DKV8J-FKVJI-GVKBU\\1\n\nSets name “1” to StartupInfo structure as a string, e.g. “0x3110x611”\n\nIt then runs GooglUpd, which cleans up the program files if they exist, and runs AdbrRader. AdbrRader\n\n(communicating through registry key “2”) writes the file vgadmysadm.tmp with the name of another registry key “2” with\n\nstartup info.\n\nC:\\Users\\[Username]\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\win32.tmp\\ vgadmysadm.tmp\n\nNext, nvidrv runs GoogleUpate, which collects system information and writes it to:\n\nC:\\Users\\[Username]\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\win32.tmp\\vg2sxoysinf.tmp\n\nThen nvidrv runs nvisdvr (registry key “4”) that collects a list of running processes, which are written to:\n\nC:\\Users\\[Username]\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\win32.tmp\\v2cgplst.tmp\n\nFinally, nvidrv runs svhosts, which tests Internet connectivity by doing a DNS query for windowsupdate.microsoft.com.\n\nIt then runs rundl132 if it has not before, by checking whether registry key name “6” is present. It sets the key to “0” and\n\nruns it.\n\nNext, “rundl132.exe” performs an HTTP GET request to myexternalip.com and collects the external IP of the infected\n\nmachine:\n\nGET /raw HTTP/1.1\n\nHost: myexternalip.com\n\nCache-Control: no-cacheHTTP/1.1 200 OK\n\nServer: nginx/1.6.2\n\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\n\nTransfer-Encoding: chunked\n\nConnection: close\n\nDate: [REDACTED]\n\nMy-External-Ip: [REDACTED]f\n\n\n-----\n\nNext, rundl132 writes:\n\nC:\\Users\\[Username]\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Temporary Internet Files\\Content.IE5\\Q7B90TFG\\raw[1].txt\n\nThen rundl132 writes the external IP to:\n\nC:\\Users\\[Username]\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\win32.tmp\\vgosysaext.tmp\n\nFinally, rundl132 runs AdobeIns, which zips the contents of the win32.tmp folder.\n\nProgram “AdobeIns.exe” takes the files written by the other programs and zips them in an encrypted, password\nprotected file:\n\nC:\\Users\\[Username]\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\win32.tmp\\drv.sys\\mxtd\n\n### Data Transmission\n\nData is transmitted by e-mail to an account presumably controlled by the attacker.\n\n**AdobeIns connects to an account at the online e-mail provider inbox.com via smtp using hardcoded credentials. The**\n\nmalware then sends an e-mail to the same inbox containing the text “Hello” and with mxtd file attached.\n\n**SMTP traffic generated by the malware to inbox.com (with redactions)**\n\n220 [REDACTED]ESMTP Postfix\n\nEHLO [REDACTED]\n\n250-[REDACTED]\n\n250-PIPELINING\n\n250-SIZE 10240000\n\n250-VRFY\n\n250-ETRN\n\n250-ENHANCEDSTATUSCODES\n\n250-8BITMIME\n\n250 DSN\n\nMAIL FROM:< [REDACTED]@inbox.com>\n\n250 2.1.0 Ok\n\nRCPT TO:< [REDACTED]@inbox.com>\n\n250 2.1.5 Ok\n\nDATA\n\n354 End data with .\n\nDate: [REDACTED]\n\nFrom: <[REDACTED]@inbox.com>\n\nX-Priority: 3 (Normal)\n\nTo: <[REDACTED]@inbox.com>\n\n\n-----\n\nContent-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary=”__MESSAGE__ID__[REDACTED]”–__MESSAGE__ID__[REDACTED]\n\nContent-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII\n\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bitHello\n\n–__MESSAGE__ID__[REDACTED]\n\nContent-Type: application/x-msdownload; name=”mxtd”\n\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: base64\n\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=”mxtd”[REDACTED]–__MESSAGE__ID__[REDACTED]–.\n\n250 2.0.0 Ok: queued as [REDACTED]\n\nQUIT\n\n221 2.0.0 Bye\n\n## Evaluation of the Malware’s Functionality\n\n**The malware seen in this case study is unusual as it relies on a half-dozen separate executable files, each with a**\n\nsingle task, and each communicating via markers dropped in the Registry.\n\nThe malware is also interesting because it does not provide remote access, but only sends an e-mail containing\n\n**the victim’s IP address and miscellaneous system information. The malware resends the information each time**\n\nthe computer is restarted, but it does not refresh the sent information on restart (which may be a bug). This behaviour\n\nstrongly suggests that the function of this malware is to serve as a beacon. The system information could be used to\n\nidentify processes to exploit in the future, however since the attacker has already triggered the execution of a file on the\n\nvictim’s system, it is surprising that more was not taken, or that a RAT (custom or widely available) was not used. A RAT\n\nwould have provided much greater access alongside IP information\n\nBy not providing remote access and other RAT functionality, the program looks less like malware, and may attract less\n\nattention from endpoint protection tools and scanners. Detections were low when the file was first submitted to\n\nVirusTotal, for example. It registered only 6/55 detections by anti virus scanners, or a 10% detection rate.\n\nTransmitting the malware via e-mail also provides a degree of obscurity, and has the additional advantage of providing a\n\nlayer of abstraction between the attacker and the target: there is no need to maintain a RAT command-and-control server.\n\nThe malware transmits autonomously, leaving the material in an inbox for the attacker to collect at a later time.\n\nThe malware has no obfuscation processes and is not highly technical in its development or interaction with Windows.\n\nNevertheless, we believe that the author of the program is aware of certain techniques to reduce the visibility of malware\n\non a network, including transmitting data via encrypted e-mail communications. However, the attacker has not correctly\n\nimplemented encrypted e-mail: the malware will not attempt to use a TLS connection in certain cases. As a result, account\n\nlogin credentials may be readily available in network traffic.\n\nIn addition, the malware uses the old PKWARE implementation of zip encryption, which is not particularly secure. The\n\npassword for the zipped file is also present in the binary without encryption or obfuscation.\n\n## Targeted Threats Index\n\n\n-----\n\np g g y g p p\n\nlevel of social engineering used (“Targeting Sophistication”), and adds a Technical Sophistication value for the attack as a\n\nmultiplier.\n\nThis attack, which has little technical sophistication (i.e., it uses no exploits, code obfuscation, or techniques to frustrate\n\nreversing, etc.), nevertheless has carefully developed social engineering in the seeding materials and bait document. Taken\n\ntogether it rates a 3 for Targeting Sophistication and a 1.25 for Technical Sophistication by our metric, yielding a TTI score\n\nof 3.75. Citizen Lab research using the TTI has found that, despite low levels of technical sophistication, with well-crafted\n\nsocial engineering malware attacks remain highly effective against civil society groups. More information is available\n\nabout the TTI in a recent Usenix Security paper.\n\n## Attribution\n\nThere are at least three possible sources for this malware attack:\n\nPro-regime / regime-linked malware groups\n\nISIS-linked hackers\n\nOther, unknown actors\n\nWe evaluate each of these possibilities in turn, drawing on the information available to us after almost three years of\n\ntracking regime-linked malware.\n\n### Pro-Regime / Regime-Linked Groups\n\nPro-regime malware actors have continually targeted the Syrian opposition with waves of malware since at least late 2011.\n\nThose campaigns have been extensively reported on by a range of groups, including Kaspersky, FireEye, Citizen Lab, the\n\nElectronic Frontier Foundation, and many others. Regime-linked malware has a number of common features that\n\ntypically serve as distinguishing characteristics:\n\nSocial engineering focusing on the needs and interests of the opposition. Although targeted, the malware seeding\n\noften aims at classes of people (e.g., people interested in ‘shocking’ news about a fighter, or ‘leaked’ information\n\nabout the Assad regime) rather than carefully written spear phishing targeting a single individual or small group.\n\nUse of widely available RATs (njRAT, Xtreme Rat, ShadowTech Rat, DarkComet RAT, and Blackshades RAT, among\n\nothers).\n\nAt least one command-and-control server located within Syrian IP space (often from a limited range of addresses).\n\nFrequent use of Dynamic DNS providers like no-ip.\n\nUse of “crypters” to obscure the binary.\n\nThese characteristics are not all present in every sample, but we have typically found one or more in almost every binary\n\nwe have examined that is Syrian regime-linked.\n\n**This malware attack differs from known regime-linked groups in each of these elements. Not only is it**\n\nexceptionally targeted, but it is also not a commonly available RAT. Nor does it have RAT functionality. The function of\n\nthe malware appears to be: identify and unmask the IP address of target(s), and resend them to the attacker with each\n\nreboot In addition data is sent to an Internet e mail address and no cr pter is sed to obsc re the binar\n\n\n-----\n\ng,,,\n\nsubstantially more functionality than this case: not only did it drop a second stage from a compromised site, but was also\n\nincluded a mechanism for exfiltrating credentials from Facebook and hooking programs like Skype.\n\nThe lack of overlap in Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) between this attack and prior attacks does not rule out\n\nSyrian regime-linked attackers. It is possible that regime-linked groups are trying a new approach. However, given that\n\nknown regime-linked groups continued to remain active during the same date range using familiar TTPs, this scenario\n\nseems unlikely. In addition, it would be strange for regime-linked malware groups to undertake significant effort to\n\nprepare and send an implant that has significantly less functionality than what they commonly use. Taken together, we\n\n**find this evidence supports the hypothesis that familiar regime-linked groups did not conduct the attack.**\n\n### ISIS-linked Hackers\n\nRSS operates in territory controlled by ISIS, and has faced extensive targeting by ISIS. Currently, they appear to be\n\ndirectly targeted by ISIS for kidnappings and other retaliation, including executions. In addition, ISIS supporters have\n\nexplicitly suggested that the group is under surveillance and actively hunted. Together this evidence suggests that ISIS\n\n**has a strong motivation for using social engineering and/or malware to locate the members of RSS.**\n\n**We think there are several features of the malware attack that align with the needs and constraints of**\n\n**ISIS and its supporters in Ar-Raqqah, more so than other groups, as we understand them. For example:**\n\nThe malware beacons location but does not provide RAT functionality.\n\nThe seeding attempts to obtain a ‘private’ Facebook identity from RSS through social engineering.\n\nThe malware exfiltrates to an online e-mail account, thus not requiring the attacker to maintain a command-and\ncontrol server online.\n\nThe social media activity of members of RSS is often highly public. Their location and exact membership, however, is\n\nsecret. We speculate that if an attacker were interested in maintaining long-term surveillance of the activities of RSS they\n\ncould have employed a RAT. However, if the attacker were interested in unmasking the location of its targets so they could\n\nbe physically tracked down, collecting IP data and system info would be a more reasonable approach.\n\nISIS or its supporters clearly have a strong interest in the (rudimentary) location tracking of the members of RSS that this\n\nmalware provides. Internet connectivity in Raqqah is extremely limited, and some of it is under ISIS control. Knowing the\n\nIP address of a target could quickly narrow down targets to specific locations, and specific Internet services, or Internet\n\ncafes in Raqqah. Given that the identities and locations of RSS members are closely guarded, such information would hold\n\nsignificant intelligence value for ISIS. Armed with this kind of information, ISIS could physically harm people within\n\nRaqqah (and it is also possible that they have the ability to operate in some capacity in border areas of Turkey).\n\nLittle is publicly known about the technical capabilities of ISIS and its supporters; however, reports have begun to emerge\n\nsuggesting that ISIS is interested in expanding its abilities. In addition, ISIS has reportedly gained the support of at least\n\none individual with some experience with social engineering and hacking: Junaid Hussain (aka TriCk), a former member\n\nof teamp0ison hacking team. While Mr. Hussain and associates have reportedly made threats against Western\n\ngovernments, it is possible that he or others working with ISIS have quietly supported an effort to identify the targeted\n\norganization which is a highly visible thorn in the side of ISIS\n\n\n-----\n\nIt is possible that the attack is the product of actors working for unknown purposes and targeting RSS. Given the activities\n\nof RSS, however, it is unclear who this might be. It is not possible, for example, to reject the theory that some unknown\n\ngroup within the FSA, or other groups opposing the Assad regime are responsible. Citizen journalists in Ar-Raqqah were\n\npreviously critical of arbitrary arrests carried out by non-ISIS groups in 2013. However, it is unclear why those groups,\n\nwhich no longer control Ar-Raqqah, would be interested in RSS in November 2014.\n\nIt is likely that third party actors, including several intelligence services, are closely monitoring various actors in the\n\nconflict through a range of electronic means. However, there is little reason to suggest that they would use a tailored but\n\ntechnically rudimentary attack to target RSS in particular.\n\n## Conclusion: ISIS Can’t Be Ruled Out\n\n**After considering each possibility, we find strong but inconclusive circumstantial evidence to support a**\n\n**link to ISIS. However, we are unable to connect this attack directly to ISIS, Mr. Hussain, or other ISIS supporters. If**\n\nindeed ISIS or its supporters are responsible, it seems reasonable that such an offensive capability may still be in\n\ndevelopment.\n\nWe hope that publishing this report will draw attention to a new and concerning threat that includes ISIS critics among its\n\ntargets. If ISIS is responsible, while this attack targets in-country impediments to ISIS objectives, other targets may\n\ninclude ideological or military adversaries abroad.\n\nWhether or not ISIS is responsible, this attack is likely the work of a non-regime threat actor who may be just beginning to\n\nfield a still-rudimentary capability in the Syrian conflict. The entry costs for engaging in malware attacks in a conflict like\n\nthe Syrian Civil War are low, and made lower by the fact that the rule of law is nonexistent for large parts of the country. In\n\nstill other parts (under regime control), malware attacks appear to be state sanctioned.\n\n### Attacks Targeting Civil Society\n\n**Citizen Lab research into targeted digital threats against civil society confirms that civil society groups**\n\n**face grave threats from targeted malware attacks, despite being under-resourced to defend against them.**\n\nThe case highlighted here is no exception: lack of IT and security resources have made it difficult for the Syrian opposition\n\nto address targeted and persistent digital threats against them. In addition, if ISIS is indeed responsible, this case suggests\n\nhow easy it is for belligerents in a conflict to begin fielding basic offensive digital capabilities, and how quickly the\n\ncapabilities can be pointed at unarmed civil society groups.\n\n## Warning: Social Engineering Thrives in Syrian Context\n\nThis attack was exceptionally targeted, and clearly reflected the work of an actor familiar with the operations of the\n\ntargeted organization. As most organizations working on issues surrounding Syria are aware, malware delivered with good\n\nsocial engineering is a constant source of danger.\n\n**This particular attack can be prevented by not opening files sent by unknown persons. However, many**\n\nattacks in Syria come from hijacked accounts and impersonate people known to the targets. Social engineering remains an\n\nunsolved problem, and continues to compromise groups throughout the Syrian opposition and their supporters.\n\n\n-----\n\ngg g p g p\n\nthreat, and their partner organizations and supporters, should urgently examine their security policies and assess\n\n**the possible risks to their operations, and the consequences of exposure of sensitive information to ISIS.**\n\nEven if the link to ISIS turns out to be incorrect, it is possible that this will be a threat in the future.\n\n[Individuals and groups at risk can also consult materials in Arabic provided
