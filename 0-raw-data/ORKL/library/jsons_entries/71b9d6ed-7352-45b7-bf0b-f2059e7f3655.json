The\nsummaries are based on our threat intelligence research and provide a representative\nsnapshot of what we have published and discussed in greater detail in our private APT\nreports. They are designed to highlight the significant events and findings that we feel people\nshould be aware of.\n\nThis is our latest installment, focusing on activities that we observed during Q2 2020.\n\nReaders who would like to learn more about our intelligence reports or request more\n[information on a specific report are encouraged to contact ‘intelreports@kaspersky.com‘.](mailto:intelreports@kaspersky.com)\n\n\n-----\n\n## The most remarkable findings\n\nOn May 11, the UK-based supercomputing center, ARCHER, announced that it would shut\ndown access to its network while it investigated a security incident. The website stated that\nthe “ARCHER facility is based around a Cray XC30 supercomputer (with 4920 nodes) that\nprovides the central computational resource”. At the same time, the German-based bwHPC\nalso announced a security incident and decided to restrict access to its resources. The Swiss\nNational Supercomputing Centre, at the time involved in a project to study the small\nmembrane protein of the coronavirus, confirmed that it, and other European highperformance computer facilities, had been attacked and that it had temporarily closed. On\nMay 15, the EGI Computer Security and Incident Response Team (EGI-CSIRT) published an\nalert covering two incidents that, according to its report, may or may not be related. Both\nincidents describe the targeting of academic data centers for “CPU mining purposes”. The\nalert includes a number of IoCs, which complement other OSINT (open-source intelligence)\nobservations. Although we weren’t able to establish with a high degree of certitude that the\nARCHER hack and the incidents described by EGI-CSIRT are related, we suspect they\nmight be. Some media speculated that all these attacks might be related to COVID-19\nresearch being carried out at the supercomputing centers.\n\n[Interestingly, last July 16th 2020, NCSC published an advisory describing malicious activity](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/files/Advisory-APT29-targets-COVID-19-vaccine-development.pdf)\ntargeting institutions related to research to find a vaccine for COVID-19. In this case, the\nmalware used in the attacks belongs to a family called WellMess, as [originally described by](https://www.lac.co.jp/lacwatch/pdf/20180614_cecreport_vol3.pdf)\nLAC Co back in 2018. Until recently, this malware was not believed to be related to any APT\nactivity. Surprisingly, NCSC attributes this activity to the APT-29 threat actor. However, it\ndoes not provide any public proof.\n\nFrom our own research, we can confirm that WellMess’s activity seems to follow a cycle,\nbeing used in campaigns every three months or so since its discovery. We observed a peak\nof activity in fall of 2019, followed by an increase in the number of C2s in February 2020. We\nalso observed high-profile targeting, including telcos, government and contractors in MENA\nand the EU. However, from our side we cannot confirm attribution or targeting of health\ninstitutions at the moment.\n\nFor more details about WellMess, you can check our presentation from GReAT ideas here:\n[https://youtu.be/xeTYLRCwnFo](https://youtu.be/xeTYLRCwnFo)\n\n## Russian-speaking activity\n\nIn May, researchers at Leonardo published a report about “Penquin_x64”, a previously\nundocumented variant of Turla’s Penquin GNU/Linux backdoor. Kaspersky has publicly\ndocumented the Penquin family, tracing it back to its Unix ancestors in the Moonlight Maze\noperation of the 1990s. We followed up on this latest research by generating network probes\nthat detect Penquin_x64 infected hosts at scale, allowing us to discover that tens of internet\n\n\n-----\n\nhoster s servers in Europe and the US are still compromised today. We think it s possible\nthat, following public disclosure of Turla’s GNU/Linux tools, the Turla threat actor may have\nbeen repurposing Penquin to conduct operations other than traditional intelligence.\n\nIn June, we discovered two different domain names, “emro-who[.]in” and “emro-who[.]org”,\ntypo-squatting the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Office for the Eastern\nMediterranean (EMRO). These domains, registered on June 21 using the Njalla.no registrar,\nseem to be used as sender domains for a spear-phishing campaign. This type of typosquatting is reminiscent of Sofacy campaigns against other international organizations.\nMoreover, we have seen Njalla.no recently used to register SPLM and XTUNNEL C2\n(command-and-control) servers and we have seen this autonomous system used by Sofacy\nin the past for a SPLM C2.\n\nHades is an elusive, highly dynamic threat actor that commonly engages in tailored hacking\n[and special access operations, such as the OlympicDestroyer attack or the](https://securelist.com/olympicdestroyer-is-here-to-trick-the-industry/84295/) [ExPetr (aka](https://securelist.com/schroedingers-petya/78870/)\nNotPetya) and Badrabbit attacks. On May 28, the US National Security Agency (NSA)\n[published an alert detailing the use by Hades of an Exim vulnerability (CVE-2019-10149) for](https://media.defense.gov/2020/May/28/2002306626/-1/-1/0/CSA%20Sandworm%20Actors%20Exploiting%20Vulnerability%20in%20Exim%20Transfer%20Agent%2020200528.pdf)\nwhat appears to be a potentially large hacking operation designed for mass access. Our own\nreport expanded on the scripts used in this operation, as well as providing other IoCs that we\ndiscovered.\n\n## Chinese-speaking activity\n\nIn late 2019, and again in March this year, we described ongoing malicious activities from a\n[previously unknown threat actor that we named Holy Water. Holy Water notably leveraged a](https://securelist.com/holy-water-ongoing-targeted-water-holing-attack-in-asia/96311/)\nGo language and Google Drive-command-driven implant that we dubbed Godlike12.\nFollowing the publication of our report, and notifications to relevant incident response\norganizations, new Holy Water samples were submitted to VirusTotal. The newly discovered\nsamples include Telegram-controlled and open-source-based Python implants that were\nprobably deployed on the victim’s networks after a successful intrusion.\n\nIn March, one of our YARA rules from previous research on ShadowPad attacks detected a\nrecently compiled executable file uploaded to VirusTotal. Later we found a few other samples\nfrom our own telemetry. ShadowPad is a modular attack platform consisting of a root module\nand various plugin modules responsible for diverse functionalities. ShadowPad was first\ndiscovered by Kaspersky in 2017. In August of that year, one of our customers detected\nsuspicious network activities. After thorough investigation, we found a legitimate software\nmodule that had been compromised and backdoored by an advanced threat actor in a\nsophisticated software supply-chain attack. We notified the software vendor and also\n[published the outcome of our investigations in a technical white paper. Since then,](https://securelist.com/shadowpad-in-corporate-networks/81432/)\nShadowPad malware has been deployed in a number of major cyberattacks, with a different\nsubset of plugins used in different attack cases: the CCleaner incident in 2017 and the\n[ShadowHammer attacks in 2018 are the major examples of such attacks.](https://securelist.com/operation-shadowhammer/89992/)\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen analyzing new samples from ShadowPad malware, compiled and used in attacks\nsince late 2019, our investigation revealed a strong connection between these recent\nShadowPad malware samples and the CactusPete threat actor. CactusPete started\ndeploying ShadowPad malware to a few victims at the beginning of 2019 through its\nHighProof backdoor. However, since late 2019, ShadowPad has been commonly used in\nCactusPete attacks.\n\nThis quarter, we described another CactusPete attack campaign which started in December\n2019 In this campaign, the CactusPete threat actor used a new method to drop an updated\nversion of the DoubleT backdoor onto the computers. The attackers implanted a new\ndropper module in the Microsoft Word Startup directory, most likely through a malicious\ndocument. This malicious dropper is responsible for dropping and executing a new version of\nthe DoubleT backdoor, which utilizes a new method of encrypting the C2 server address.\n\nWhile analysing compromised machines in Central Asia, we revealed an additional infection\nthat was unrelated to the initial subject of our investigation. This led us to detect previously\nunknown malware that we dubbed B&W, which provides an attacker with the capabilities to\nremotely control a victim’s machine. Further analysis of the samples, infrastructure and other\nrelated artefacts allowed us to conclude, with medium confidence, that the newly found\nmalware is related to the SixLittleMonkeys APT. This group is known to have been active for\nseveral years, targeting government entities in Central Asia.\n\nHoneyMyte is an APT threat actor that we have been tracking for several years. In February,\nour fellow researchers at Avira blogged about HoneyMyte PlugX variants that they had\nrecently observed targeting Hong Kong. PlugX has been used by multiple APT groups over\nthe past decade, especially shared among Chinese-speaking threat actors, and has changed\nin many ways. Avira´s post covers the PlugX loader and backdoor payload, including its USB\ncapabilities. In May, we published an update on this threat actor, specifically providing timely\nindicators to aid in threat hunting for some of the PlugX variants found in the wild between\nJanuary and May this year.\n\nIn May, we discovered a watering hole on the website of a Southeast Asian top official. This\nwatering hole, set up in March, seemed to leverage allowlisting and social engineering\ntechniques to infect its targets. The final payload was a simple ZIP archive containing a\nreadme file prompting the victim to execute a CobaltStrike implant. The mechanism used to\nexecute CobaltStrike was DLL side-loading, which decrypted and executed a CobaltStrike\nstager shellcode. Analysis of the code, the infrastructure and the victimology led us to\nattribute this watering-hole, with high confidence, to the HoneyMyte APT threat actor.\n\nQuarian is a little-known malicious program that Chinese-speaking actors have used since\naround 2012. We hadn’t spotted any further activity until we observed a resurgence in an\nattack by the Icefog group in 2019. We tracked the activity of the malware following this and\nnoticed a new variant that was used during several attacks on Middle Eastern and African\n\n\n-----\n\ngovernments during 2020. In one case, we could see that this variant was deployed following\nexploitation of the CVE-2020-0688 vulnerability on the network of a government entity. This\nvulnerability, which was publicly reported in February 2020, allows an authenticated user to\nrun commands as SYSTEM on a Microsoft Exchange server. In this case, the server was\nindeed compromised and was hosting the ChinaChopper webshell, which was used to\nobtain, and later launch, the Quarian and PlugX backdoors. Our analysis led us to assume,\nwith medium to high confidence, that the group behind these attacks is one we track under\nthe name CloudComputating – a Chinese-speaking actor that, based on previous reports,\nhas targeted high-profile Middle Eastern diplomatic targets.\n\n[In March, researchers at Check Point Research published a report describing an APT](https://research.checkpoint.com/2020/vicious-panda-the-covid-campaign/)\ncampaign that targeted Mongolia’s public sector and leveraged a coronavirus-themed lure to\nconduct its initial intrusion. We were able to discover further samples and another COVIDthemed document with the same targeting, as well as additional targets in Russia. We\nattribute this activity with medium confidence to IronHusky.\n\n## Middle East\n\nThe MuddyWater APT was discovered in 2017 and has been active in the Middle East ever\nsince. In 2019, we reported activity against telecoms providers in Iraq and Iran, as well as\ngovernment bodies in Lebanon. We recently discovered MuddyWater using a new C++\ntoolchain in a new wave of attacks in which the actor leveraged an open-source utility called\nSecure Socket Funneling for lateral movement.\n\nAt the end of May, we observed that Oilrig had included the DNSExfitrator tool in its toolset. It\nallows the threat actor to use the DNS over HTTPS (DoH) protocol. Use of the DNS protocol\nfor malware communications is a technique that Oilrig has been using for a long time. The\ndifference between DNS- and DoH-based requests is that, instead of plain text requests to\nport 53, they would use port 443 in encrypted packets. Oilrig added the publicly available\nDNSExfiltrator tool to its arsenal, which allows DoH queries to Google and Cloudflare\nservices. This time, the operators decided to use subdomains of a COVID-related domain\nwhich are hardcoded in the DNSExfitrator detected samples.\n\n## Southеast Asia and Korean Peninsula\n\nBlueNoroff is one of the most prolific financially motivated APT actors and we have published\nseveral reports of BlueNoroff campaigns targeting financial institutions. Recently, we\nuncovered another campaign that has been active since at least 2017. In this campaign, the\ngroup sends spear-phishing emails containing an archived Windows shortcut file. The file\nnames are disguised as security or cryptocurrency related files in order to entice users into\nexecuting them. The infection chain started from this shortcut file is a complex multi-stage\ninfection procedure. Before delivering the Windows executable payload, the actor uses two\nVBS and three PowerShell scripts in order to collect system information. The actor very\n\n\n-----\n\ncarefully delivers the final payload only to the intended targets. The backdoor payload also\nutilizes a multi-stage infection procedure. The actor uses it to control infected hosts and\nimplants additional malware for surveillance. These malicious programs are responsible for\nstealing the user’s keystrokes and saving a screenshot of the infected machine. The main\ntargets of this campaign are financial institutions, such as cryptocurrency businesses, and\nfintech companies. We identified diverse victims from 10 countries, as well as more potential\nvictims from open source intelligence.\n\nThe Lazarus group has been a major threat actor for several years. Alongside goals like\ncyber-espionage and cyber-sabotage, this threat actor has targeted banks and other\nfinancial companies around the globe. The group continues to be very active. We recently\nobserved the Lazarus group attacking a software vendor in South Korea using Bookcode,\nmalware that we evaluate to be a Manuscrypt variant, utilizing a watering-hole attack to\ndeliver it. Manuscrypt is one of the Lazarus group’s tools that is actively being updated and\nused. The group attacked the same victim twice. Almost a year prior to compromising this\nvictim, Lazarus attempted to infect it by masquerading as a well-known security tool, but\nfailed. We were able to construct the group’s post-exploitation activity, identifying various\nfreeware and red-teaming tools used. Although Lazarus has recently tended to focus more\non targeting the financial industry, we believe that in this campaign they were seeking to\nexfiltrate intellectual property. We also observed that they previously spread Bookcode using\na decoy document related to a company working in the defense sector. Based on our\nobservations, we evaluate that the Bookcode malware is being used exclusively for cyberespionage campaigns.\n\nIn April, we released an early warning about the VHD ransomware, which was first spotted in\nlate March. This ransomware stood out because of its self-replication method. The use of a\nspreading utility compiled with victim-specific credentials was reminiscent of APT campaigns,\nbut at the time we were unable to link the attack to an existing group. However, Kaspersky\nwas able to identify an incident in which the VHD ransomware was deployed, in close\nconjunction with known Lazarus tools, against businesses in France and Asia. This indicates\nthat Lazarus is behind the VHD ransomware campaigns that have been documented so far.\nAs far as we know, this is also the first time it has been established that the Lazarus group\nhas resorted to targeted ransomware attacks for financial gain.\n\nLast year we created a private report on a malware framework that we named MATA, which\nwe attribute, with low confidence, to the Lazarus group. This framework included several\ncomponents, such as a loader, orchestrator and plug-ins. Initially, this framework targeted\nWindows and Linux. However, in April we discovered a suspicious macOS file uploaded to\nVirusTotal using a rule to detect the MATA malware framework. After looking into this\nmalware, we confirmed that it was a macOS variant of the MATA malware. The malware\ndevelopers Trojanized an open-source two-factor authentication application and utilized\n\n\n-----\n\nanother open-source application template. While investigating, to find more solid evidence\nfor attribution, we found an old Manuscrypt strain that used a similar configuration structure.\nWe also discovered a cluster of C2 servers probably related to this campaign.\n\nThe MATA framework was not the only way that Lazarus targeted macOS. We also observed\na cluster of activity linked to [Operation](https://securelist.com/operation-applejeus-sequel/95596/) [AppleJeus. The other was similar to the macOS](https://securelist.com/operation-applejeus-sequel/95596/)\nmalware used in a campaign that we call TangDaiwbo. This is a multi-platform\ncryptocurrency exchange campaign: Lazarus utilizes macro-embedded Office documents\nand spreads PowerShell or macOS malware, depending on the victim’s system.\n\nEarly this year, we reported improvements in a Lazarus campaign targeting a cryptocurrency\nbusiness. In this campaign, Lazarus adopted a downloader that sends compromised host\ninformation and selectively fetches the next-stage payload. Recently, we identified a Lazarus\ncampaign with similar strategies, but targeting academic and automotive sectors. Lazarus\nalso adopted new methods to deliver its tools. First of all, the group elaborated its\nweaponized document by adopting remote template injection techniques. Previously,\nLazarus delivered macro-embedded documents to the victim, but the group has now applied\none more stage to hinder detection. The group also utilized an open-source PDF reader\nnamed Sumatra PDF to make Trojanized applications. They created a Trojanized PDF\nreader, sending it to the victim with a crafted PDF file. If the victim opens this file, the\nTrojanised PDF viewer implants malicious files and shows decoy documents to deceive the\nvictim. The actor delivers the final payload very carefully, and executes it in memory.\nFortunately, we were able to get the final payload and confirm that it was a Manuscrypt\nvariant that we had already described. We also found that it’s the same malware variant that\nthe US CISA (Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency) recently reported, named\nCOPPERHEDGE.\n\n[Following our report describing the long-standing PhantomLance campaign in Southeast](https://securelist.com/apt-phantomlance/96772/)\nAsia, we published a private report providing detailed attribution based on discovered\noverlaps with reported campaigns of the OceanLotus APT. In particular, we found multiple\ncode similarities with the previous Android campaign, as well as similarities in macOS\nbackdoors, infrastructure overlap with Windows backdoors and a couple of cross-platform\nresemblances. Based on our research, we believe, with medium confidence, that\nPhantomLance is a modern Android campaign conducted by OceanLotus. Apart from the\nattribution details, we described the actor’s spreading strategy using techniques to bypass\napp market filters. We also provided additional details about samples associated with\npreviously reported suspected infrastructure, as well as the latest sample deployed in 2020\nthat uses Firebase to decrypt its payload.\n\nAdditionally, OceanLotus has been using new variants of its multi-stage loader since the\nsecond half of 2019. The new variants use target-specific information (username, hostname,\netc.) of the targeted host that they obtained beforehand, in order to ensure their final implant\n\n\n-----\n\nis deployed on the right victim. The group continues to deploy its backdoor implant, as well\nas Cobalt Strike Beacon, configuring them with updated infrastructure.\n\n## Other interesting discoveries\n\nThe Deceptikons APT is a long-running espionage group believed to have been providing\nmercenary services for almost a decade now. The group is not technically sophisticated and\nhas not, to our knowledge, deployed zero-day exploits. The Deceptikons infrastructure and\nmalware set is clever, rather than technically advanced. It is also highly persistent and in\nmany ways reminds us of WildNeutron. Deceptikon’s repeated targeting of commercial and\nnon-governmental organizations is somewhat unusual for APT actors. In 2019, Deceptikons\nspear-phished a set of European law firms, deploying PowerShell scripts. As in previous\ncampaigns, the actor used modified LNK files requiring user interaction to initially\ncompromise systems and execute a PowerShell backdoor. In all likelihood, the group’s\nmotivations included obtaining specific financial information, details of negotiations, and\nperhaps even evidence of the law firms’ clientele.\n\nMagicScroll (aka AcidBox) is the name we’ve given to a sophisticated malware framework,\nwhose main purpose is to decrypt and load an arbitrary payload in kernel mode. The\nframework consists of several stages. The first stage is a Windows security provider that is\nloaded by the system on boot and executed in user mode. This decrypts and runs a second\npayload, which is physically stored in the registry. Although we weren’t able to find a victim\nwith this second stage, we were able to find a file that matches the expected format of the\nsecond stage. This second stage payload utilizes a well-known vulnerability in a VirtualBox\ndriver (CVE-2008-3431) to load the third stage, which is designed to run in kernel mode. The\nkernel mode payload is decrypted from a resource from the second stage, using the key\nretrieved from the registry. Unfortunately, we couldn’t find a decryption key to decrypt the\nthird stage payload, so we don’t know what the last part of this malware framework looks\nlike. Although the code is quite sophisticated, we couldn’t identify any similarity with other\nknown frameworks.\n\nAarogya Setu is the name of a mandatory COVID-19 mobile tracking app developed by the\nNational Informatics Centre, an organization that comes under the Ministry of Electronics and\nInformation Technology in India. It allows its users to connect to essential health services in\nIndia. With cyber criminals and APT actors taking advantage of pandemic-tracking\napplications to distribute Trojanized mobile apps, we investigated and identified apps that\nmimic the appearance and behavior of the legitimate Aarogya Setu app while deploying\nAndroid RATs. We consider one of these to be a new version of a RAT that we previously\nreported being used by the Transparent Tribe threat actor.\n\n## Final thoughts\n\n\n-----\n\nThe threat landscape isn t always full of groundbreaking events. However, a review of the\nactivities of APT threat actors indicates that there are always interesting developments. Our\nregular quarterly reviews are intended to highlight these key developments.\n\nHere are the main trends that we’ve seen in Q2 2020.\n\nGeo-politics remains an important motive for some APT threat actors, as shown in the\nactivities of MuddyWater, the compromise of the Middle East Eye website and the\ncampaigns of CloudComputating and HoneyMyte groups.\nAs is clear from the activities of Lazarus and BlueNoroff, financial gain is another driver\nfor some threat actors – including the use of ransomware attacks.\nWhile Southeast Asia continues to be an active region for APT activities, this quarter\nwe have also observed heavy activity by Chinese-speaking groups, including\nShadowPad, HoneyMyte, CactusPete, CloudComputating and SixLittleMonkeys.\nAPT threat actors continue to exploit software vulnerabilities – examples this quarter\ninclude Hades and MagicScroll.\nWe have noted before that the use of mobile implants is no longer a novelty, and this\nquarter is no exception, as illustrated by the PhantomLance campaign.\nIt is clear that APT actors, like opportunistic cybercriminals, continue to exploit the\nCOVID-19 pandemic as a theme to lure potential victims. However, we would note\nonce again that this doesn’t represent a shift in TTPs.\n\nAs always, we would note that our reports are the product of our visibility into the threat\nlandscape. However, it should be borne in mind that, while we strive to continually improve,\nthere is always the possibility that other sophisticated attacks may fly under our radar.\n\n[APT](https://securelist.com/tag/apt/)\n[Backdoor](https://securelist.com/tag/backdoor/)\n[Chinese-speaking cybercrime](https://securelist.com/tag/chinese-speaking-cybercrime/)\n[Financial malware](https://securelist.com/tag/financial-malware/)\n[Lazarus](https://securelist.com/tag/lazarus/)\n[Malware](https://securelist.com/tag/malware/)\n[Ransomware](https://securelist.com/tag/ransomware/)\n[Russian-speaking cybercrime](https://securelist.com/tag/russian-speaking-cybercrime/)\n[Targeted attacks](https://securelist.com/tag/targeted-attacks/)\n[Turla](https://securelist.com/tag/turla/)\n\nAuthors\n\nGReAT\n\n\n-----\n\nAPT trends report Q2 2020\n\nYour email address will not be published.
