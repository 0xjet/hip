    "plain_text": "# Visser, a parts manufacturer for Tesla and SpaceX, confirms data breach\n\n**techcrunch.com/2020/03/01/visser-breach/**\n\nZack Whittaker, Kirsten Korosec\n\nA precision parts maker for space and defense contractors has confirmed a “cybersecurity\nincident,” which TechCrunch has learned was likely caused by ransomware.\n\nVisser Precision, a Denver, Colorado-based manufacturer, makes custom parts for a number\nof industries, including automotive and aeronautics. In a brief statement, the company\nconfirmed it was “the recent target of a criminal cybersecurity incident, including access to or\ntheft of data.”\n\nThe company said it “continues its comprehensive investigation of the attack, and business\nis operating normally,” a spokesperson told TechCrunch.\n\nSecurity researchers say the attack was caused by the DoppelPaymer ransomware, a new\nkind of file-encrypting malware which first exfiltrates the company’s data. The ransomware\nthreatens to publish the stolen files if the ransom is not paid.\n\n[DoppelPaymer is the latest in an emerging list of data-stealing ransomware. In December,](https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/08/as-ransomware-gets-craftier-companies-must-start-thinking-creatively/)\nsecurity staffing firm Allied Universal was one of the first companies that had sensitive\n[employee and business data published after the company declined to pay a $2.3 million](https://www.cyber.nj.gov/data-breach-alerts/20191202/allied-universal-security-staffing-firm)\n\n\n-----\n\nransom for the data.\n\nBrett Callow, a threat analyst at security firm Emsisoft, first alerted TechCrunch to the\nwebsite that was publishing files stolen by the DoppelPaymer ransomware.\n\nThe website contains a list of files stolen from Visser, including folders with customer names\n— including Tesla, SpaceX, and aircraft maker Boeing, and defense contractor Lockheed\nMartin. A portion of the files were made available for download. (We are not linking to the\nransomware’s website.) The documents included non-disclosure agreements between Visser\nand both Tesla and SpaceX. Another file appeared to be a partial schematic for a missile\nantenna was marked as containing “Lockheed Martin proprietary information.”\n\nSpokespeople for Tesla, SpaceX, and Boeing and did not immediately comment outside\nbusiness hours.\n\nA Lockheed Martin spokesperson said the company is “aware of the situation with Visser\nPrecision and are following our standard response process for potential cyber incidents\nrelated to our supply chain.”\n\nThe DoppelPaymer ransomware has been active since mid-last year, and its victims have\nincluded the Chilean government and Pemex, Mexico’s state-owned petroleum company. But\nunlike the Maze ransomware, from which DoppelPaymer derives much of its data-stealing\ninspiration, the ransom note does not say that data has been stolen. Instead, it’s only\ndisclosed if the company goes to the ransomware’s website to pay.\n\n“Some companies may not even realize that their data has been exfiltrated prior to it being\npublished,” said Callow.\n\nThe website hosting the stolen files said there was a “lot” more files to be published.\n\n“Data theft is a strategy that multiple groups have now adopted and, consequently,\nransomware incidents should be treated as data breaches until it can be established they are\nnot,” said Callow.\n\n_Updated with Lockheed comment._\n\n[As ransomware gets craftier, companies must start thinking creatively](https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/08/as-ransomware-gets-craftier-companies-must-start-thinking-creatively/)\n\n\n-----",
