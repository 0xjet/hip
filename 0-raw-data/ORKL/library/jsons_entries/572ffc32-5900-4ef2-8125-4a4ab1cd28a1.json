The malicious activity was conducted between June 2019 and March 2021. In the beginning of the operation the**\nthreat actors used Aria-Body loader and Nebulae as the first stage of the attack. From our observations, starting with\nSeptember 2020, the threat actors included the RainyDay backdoor in their toolkit. The purpose of this operation was\ncyber-espionage and data theft.\n\nLegitimate software abused by NAIKON:\n\n- ARO 2012 Tutorial 8.0.12.0\n\n- VirusScan On-Demand Scan Task Properties (McAfee, Inc.)\n\n- Sandboxie COM Services (BITS) 3.55.06 (SANDBOXIE L.T.D)\n\n- Outlook Item Finder 11.0.5510 (Microsoft Corporation)\n\n- Mobile Popup Application 16.00 (Quick Heal Technologies (P) Ltd.)\n\n\n-----\n\nNAIKON – Traces from a Military Cyber-Espionage Operation\n\n## Toolset\n\nThe main instrument used in this operation is the RainyDay backdoor through which several other custom-made or\npublic tools were brought during the attack life cycle. In this section, technical details about the toolset used in the kill\nchain will be provided.\n\nUsing the RainyDay backdoor, the actors performed reconnaissance, uploaded its reverse proxy tools and scanners,\nexecuted the password dump tools, performed lateral movement, achieved persistence, all to compromise the victims’\nnetwork and to get to the information of interest.\n\nThe following diagram illustrates the toolset used by the RainyDay Backdoor:\n\n**Tools executed by RainyDay backdoor**\n\nThe persistence mechanism is usually installed manually, as the actor tends to mimic legitimate applications, but in\nsome cases, it is automatically set by the binaries themselves. The intention to hide through the legitimate software\nwas observed during the deployment of exfiltration tools – the sbiedll.dll tool is used to automatically collect files with\na given extension and to upload them to Dropbox; the tool masquerading itself as a chrome process.\n\nThe second backdoor, that we call Nebulae, is supposedly used as a measure of precaution to not lose the persistence\nin case any signs of infections gets detected.\n\nFor lateral movement, WMIC.exe and schtasks.exe with admin domain credentials were used, a strong indicator that\ncredentials were stolen at  some point during the attack.\n\n\n-----\n\nNAIKON – Traces from a Military Cyber-Espionage Operation\n\n### Rainyday backdoor execution\n\nDuring the investigation, we observed a particular technique to be extensively used for tool execution, namely SideLoading. This technique was always used for RainyDay execution and there was always a vulnerable executable along\nwith a DLL file and the rdmin.src file containing the encrypted backdoor payload.\n\nWe also noticed 2 flows of execution of the RainyDay backdoor, one of which is the execution of a SFX file that drops\nall 3 files in a temporary folder:\n\n**The RainyDay execution from SFX**\n\nThe other flow was the execution of a vulnerable executable after manually planting all files in the same folder:\n\n**Direct RainyDay execution**\n\nThe SFX file used in the operation contains the legitimate Mobile Popup Application from Quick Heal AntiVirus, the DLL\nfile pc2msupp dll that extracts the payload from rdmin src\n\n\n-----\n\nNAIKON – Traces from a Military Cyber-Espionage Operation\n\nAnother side-loading triad used by the actor was the Outlook Item Finder and the outllib.dll that obtains the payload\nfrom rdmin.src.\n\nAfter the malicious DLL file is loaded, it changes the flow of the legitimate executable to run code that reads the\ncontent of the rdmin.src file, decrypts the shellcode by XOR-ing the content with the value of 0x7A, and finally, executes\nthe shellcode. The result is the presence of the RainyDay in memory.\n\nIf visualizing the RainyDay memory dump, available on VirusTotal in a hex viewer it’s easy to observe the config section\nthat appears to be obfuscated by XOR-ing with the 0x2D value. After decryption the config looks as shown in the image\nbelow:\n\n**RainyDay config**\n\nAt a glance, the configuration data contains the C&C address, a folder name, a service description, a mutex name and a\nservice name, all this information being confirmed during the analysis.\n\nAs shown in the image, the C&C address of the RainyDay extracted from the SFX sample is cat.suttiphong.com.\n\nNext step taken was collecting more rdmin.src samples from our file collection, which led us to more RainyDay\npayloads, as shown in the following table:\n\n**rdmin.src** **C&C addresses**\n\n78782a24805b52713cb63ba3cad2569b905edea96ca3609f8464f1b7c1ba05dc **asp.asphspes.com**\n\nff13e4561460f00a2777ce7a70902d65fd7b8c38a5aa90ac1d8bd868c271da29 **www.tnelgnmc.com**\n\n**www.dthjxc.com**\n\n5dc87097c6ff85df9a6ca03f35ad9a2fc0b7b1a3083a4a30d1d64b51f88e452a **172.245.23.143**\n\n**185.199.226.106**\n\n0569ea0c080e9ed28d2cf6dce03123d93d100fd59e3a6f4719ff4a0aebf5ebb6 **172.245.244.86**\n\nOne of the samples has many debug logs that indicate that all payloads in their initial form are DLL files that export a\nfunction called fdvbfa, which is actually the entry point of the RainyDay backdoor. Its execution starts 4 threads with\nvery suggestive functionality:\n\n- “[*] Start to create register service thread...” - it registers the current process as a service process\n\n- “[*] Start to create main work thread...” - it contacts the C&C server and executes the received commands\n\n- “[*] Start to create self protect thread...” - it sets the SE_DACL_PROTECTED for process protection\n\n- “[*] Start to create hide service thread...”- it manipulates service settings in order to hide the service activity\n\nMore about backdoor capabilities that may be executed by the main thread are listed below:\n\n|rdmin.src|C&C addresses|\n|---|---|\n|78782a24805b52713cb63ba3cad2569b905edea96ca3609f8464f1b7c1ba05dc|asp.asphspes.com|\n|ff13e4561460f00a2777ce7a70902d65fd7b8c38a5aa90ac1d8bd868c271da29|www.tnelgnmc.com www.dthjxc.com|\n|5dc87097c6ff85df9a6ca03f35ad9a2fc0b7b1a3083a4a30d1d64b51f88e452a|172.245.23.143 185.199.226.106|\n|0569ea0c080e9ed28d2cf6dce03123d93d100fd59e3a6f4719ff4a0aebf5ebb6|172.245.244.86|\n\n|MAJOR code|command|note|\n|---|---|---|\n|1004|CMD_MAJOR_FILE|File manipulation, file upload and download|\n\n\n-----\n\nNAIKON – Traces from a Military Cyber-Espionage Operation\n\n**MAJOR code** **command** **note**\n\n1009 CMD_MAJOR_UNISTALL Uninstall by deleting the service and triad files\n\n1010 CMD_MAJOR_PROCESS Process termination and listing\n\n1011 CMD_MAJOR_SERVICES Service manipulation\n\n1013 CMD_MAJOR_SCREENSHOT Screen Capture with subsequent sending to c&c\n\n1190 CMD_DEAL_HTTP_UPLOAD\n\n1191 Unknown name\n\nThe communication is realized through the TCP and HTTP (if the first method is not working).\n\nAn interesting fact is that the traffic seems to be encrypted using RC4 algorithm and all samples we analyzed uses the\nsame key - “aefbA_(*vaER#$78B?>C”.\n\nThe binaries FINDER.exe, MOBPOPUP.exe and the SFX file were found under many file paths:\n\n**FINDER.exe** C:\\windows\\lsm.exe\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Google\\Update\\GooleUpdates.exe\nC:\\ProgramData\\Chrome\\lsm.exe\nC:\\Windows\\Chrome.exe\nC:\\Program Files\\(x86)\\Google\\Chrome\\Chrome.exe\nC:\\ProgramData\\Keven\\front.exe\nC:\\ProgramData\\Chrome\\dwm.exe\nC:\\StorageReports\\Scheduled\\front.exe\n\n**MOBPOPUP.exe** c:\\windows\\sploor.exe\n%ProgramData%\\Adobe\\explorer.exe\n\n**SFX** _%PROGRAM_FILES%\\vmware\\vmware tools\\vmtools.exe_\n\nBy looking at the specific file paths used to hide the abused files and the malicious dropper, we assume that the actors\ntry to mimic the legitimate software that is running on the machine. This fact is particularly highlighted by the vmtools.\n**exe that differs by one letter from the legitimate executable vmtoolsd.exe.**\n\nWe made similar observations in services and scheduled task names used to achieve persistence and to perform\nlateral movement:\n\n- Malicious service “sstpsvces” mimics the legitimate Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol Service(SstpSvc)\n\n- Malicious service “GoogleUpdate” mimics google update services\n\n- Malicious service “taskmgr” mimics the legitimate taskmgr command\n\n_•_ _Malicious task “sharpcifs” mimics software name from SharpCifs - Cross-Platform SMB Client_\n\n_•_ _Other malicious task names observed - “Check”, “ChromeCheck”, “googleupdate”_\n\nIt is worth mentioning that the actors used WMIC.exe and schtaks.exe for the lateral movement step.\n\n### Nebulae Backdoor\n\n|MAJOR code|command|note|\n|---|---|---|\n|1009|CMD_MAJOR_UNISTALL|Uninstall by deleting the service and triad files|\n|1010|CMD_MAJOR_PROCESS|Process termination and listing|\n|1011|CMD_MAJOR_SERVICES|Service manipulation|\n|1013|CMD_MAJOR_SCREENSHOT|Screen Capture with subsequent sending to c&c|\n|1190|CMD_DEAL_HTTP_UPLOAD||\n|1191|Unknown name||\n\n|FINDER.exe|C:\\windows\\lsm.exe C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Google\\Update\\GooleUpdates.exe C:\\ProgramData\\Chrome\\lsm.exe C:\\Windows\\Chrome.exe C:\\Program Files\\(x86)\\Google\\Chrome\\Chrome.exe C:\\ProgramData\\Keven\\front.exe C:\\ProgramData\\Chrome\\dwm.exe C:\\StorageReports\\Scheduled\\front.exe|\n|---|---|\n|MOBPOPUP.exe|c:\\windows\\sploor.exe %ProgramData%\\Adobe\\explorer.exe|\n|SFX|%PROGRAM_FILES%\\vmware\\vmware tools\\vmtools.exe|\n\n\n-----\n\nNAIKON – Traces from a Military Cyber-Espionage Operation\n\nThe story behind the Nebulae tool started after the analysis of a process tree of the RainyDay process. The data\nrevealed a process executed by the previously described backdoor with the following file path - C:\\windows\\help\\help\\\n**dwm.exe. Further analysis revealed that the binary has backdoor capabilities.**\n\nBy clustering more suspected similar binaries, we observed a pattern for a few of them – the Nebulae string appears\nas the ExportName of the file. Moreover, we found a similar sample with the following pdb path - C:\\Projects\\New\\\n**ne\\NebulaeForPool_ConfigEXE - Explorer__1\\Release\\Nebulae.pdb and all those facts inspired us to call the tool**\nNebulae.\n\nIn this operation, the Nebulae backdoor appears in the form of executable, as well as DLL file, the last form being used\nmostly for side-loading technique. A particular example of an abused file is the VirusScan On-Demand Scan Task\n**Properties:**\n\n**The loading of Nebulae as vsodscpl.dll**\n\nThere are more exploited executables used for the Nebulae loading as we found a sample that exports 2 particular\nfunctions, StartUserModeBrowserInjection and StopUserModeBrowserInjection, indicating that the actors try to\nimpersonate the chrome_frame_helper.dll.\n\nThe analysis of the most recent samples showed that the backdoor is capable of:\n\n- Getting LogicalDrive information (Drive type, FreeSpace, VolumeInformation)\n\n- Listing, moving and deleting files and directories\n\n- Executing a process using CreateProcess or through a CMD shell\n\n- Listing and terminating processes\n\n- Downloading and uploading files from and to C&C\n\nCommunication with the C&C is realized by sending and receiving packets of a fixed form through a TCP connection.\nThe format of packets can be visualized on the diagram below and represent an array of bytes of dynamic length with\na 77 bytes header that stores the RC4 key used for payload encryption (the key is created by concatenating each fourth\nbyte):\n\n\n-----\n\nNAIKON – Traces from a Military Cyber-Espionage Operation\n\n**Packet format**\n\nThe address of C&C is encrypted using XOR operation with the key value set to the length of the string. This method\nof encrypting the C&C address is the same in the almost all samples of Nebulae we were able to collect – the single\nexception being an old sample – 3b9629122f33d5f354026923fdd3e499f43b01054c3dc74224aa242a4dd397c1, in\nwhich the C&C address is XOR-ed with the 0x3b value.\n\nThe persistence installation for a Nebulae sample was captured in a process tree of a RainyDay process, where the\nlatter executes the following command line:\n\n**reg add HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion Run /v narsris /t REG_SZ /d \\”C:\\\\windows\\\\help\\\\help\\\\dwm.**\n\n**exe\\” /f**\n\nAnother artifact showing more details about the Nebulae persistence is a binary we found having the %PROGRAM_\n**FILES_COMMON%\\system\\ado\\dll.exe file path that creates a service dot1 with the “Windows Update Agent1” as**\n**DisplayName that is set to load the %SYSWOW64%\\dot1.dll file. The identified dot1.dll file is a Nebulae sample that**\nexports the ServiceMain function.\n\nThe data we obtained so far tell almost nothing about the role of the Nebulae in this operation, but the presence of a\npersistence mechanism could mean that it is used as backup access point to victim in the case of a negative scenario\nfor actors.\n\nMore about samples of Nebulae we found are listed in the following tables:\n\n**hash** **filename** **C&C**\n\n**71755f4cd827551d0cf3419d0afc548ffdc020d0b9359a71a1a2039d27d5a37d** dwm.exe php.tripadvisorsapp.com\n\n**54738bb403a25b005bf145d4ed2a3719b0c4869360eb82776171c1b6d5ec0952** dot1.dll news.dgwktifrn.com\n\n**0c438622b62bf03a33e3e25d3ff1afea740111c2d90a2b9659eddd7a5021cd5d** nta.dll mail.tripadvisorsapp.com\n\n**2181fdf09d22e0b55db7e70914eec71ff98d55f0f4899a9f5ef9dba1f2ad9792** vsodscpl. java.tripadvisorsapp.com\n\ndll\n\n**ee9f11a530df4950981daea65dc029e05f76516d2ac9ce4541ccf89a44e26285** vsodscpl. osde.twifwkeyh.com\n\ndll\n\n**c5c39979728f635b324dfcb7e32cbd6c4cc877ff4f9bd39113c7a2722f49d399** vsodscpl. aloha.fekeigawy.com\n\ndll\n\n**592c36bc4117f150f8fce1b54d064eb14bd3236b3f729ba12750aed3bb6006b4** nta.dll www.wahatmrjn.com\n\n**Samples related to the current operation**\n\n|hash|filename|C&C|\n|---|---|---|\n|71755f4cd827551d0cf3419d0afc548ffdc020d0b9359a71a1a2039d27d5a37d|dwm.exe|php.tripadvisorsapp.com|\n|54738bb403a25b005bf145d4ed2a3719b0c4869360eb82776171c1b6d5ec0952|dot1.dll|news.dgwktifrn.com|\n|0c438622b62bf03a33e3e25d3ff1afea740111c2d90a2b9659eddd7a5021cd5d|nta.dll|mail.tripadvisorsapp.com|\n|2181fdf09d22e0b55db7e70914eec71ff98d55f0f4899a9f5ef9dba1f2ad9792|vsodscpl. dll|java.tripadvisorsapp.com|\n|ee9f11a530df4950981daea65dc029e05f76516d2ac9ce4541ccf89a44e26285|vsodscpl. dll|osde.twifwkeyh.com|\n|c5c39979728f635b324dfcb7e32cbd6c4cc877ff4f9bd39113c7a2722f49d399|vsodscpl. dll|aloha.fekeigawy.com|\n|592c36bc4117f150f8fce1b54d064eb14bd3236b3f729ba12750aed3bb6006b4|nta.dll|www.wahatmrjn.com|\n\n\n-----\n\nNAIKON – Traces from a Military Cyber-Espionage Operation\n\n**hash** **C&C**\n\n**bad4fba4b2863ddbf85aaabf1c77f60ea972dd2ea39d7b7963b862b0b4aacbb5** dns.seekvibega.com\n\n**dc64e5497bbb2e128a821a382e1bd02a7057982913f2da673c4897c64ff5090c** news.dgwktifrn.com\n\n**1df627dab5349caa21b7796747299cc00d5def8f1f9af2bfd93d61a74455151e** news.dgwktifrn.com\n\n**6bce8eb669aa383397943579dd3432ea875227733b4430489fe985d326b5edb5** cent.myanmarnewsrecent.com\n\n**3b9629122f33d5f354026923fdd3e499f43b01054c3dc74224aa242a4dd397c1** http.jmrmfitym.com\n\n**Samples found by similarity criteria (not necessarily related to the current operation)**\n\n### Exfiltration Tools\n\nThe same source of information – a process tree of the RainyDay revealed a new tool and a new case of side-loading\nshown on the schema:\n\n**Exfiltration tool loading**\n\nThe legitimate SandboxieBITS.exe file and the malicious file collector sbiedll.dll were found in the C:\\Program Files\n**(x86)\\Google\\Chrome\\ directory under the names Chrome.exe and sbiedll.dll, respectively.**\n\nThe tool collects recently changed files with a specific extension and uploads them to Dropbox. So, the specific\ndirectory and the file names were chosen in order to mask the traffic to Dropbox as originating from a legitimate source\nand subsequently, to fly under the radar.\n\nThe sbiedll.dll exports two functions, **SbieApi_Log and SbieDll_Hook, that matches the static imports for the**\n**SandboxieBITS.exe binary, the SbieDll_Hook** being the entrypoint of the exfiltration tool.\n\nOnce loaded, the tool tries to assign to the registry key value named **contom under the Run key the file path of the**\nexecutable In order to achieve persistence via Registry keys.\n\nNext steps during the execution correspond to the start of two decoupled components that run in separated threads:\nthe collection component and the uploading component.\n\nAnalyzing the collecting component, we found the following:\n\n  - It uses ReadDirectoryChangeW for folder monitoring, where the target folders are all fixed and remote drives.\n\n  - The monitoring mechanism is practically identical to the one available on Github.\n\n  - All files that match the given criteria are copied to C:\\ProgramData\\Adobe\\temp.\n\n  - Each event received after a file change (FILE_ACTION_ADDED, FILE_ACTION_REMOVED, FILE_ACTION_\nMODIFIED, FILE_ACTION_RENAMED_OLD_NAME, FILE_ACTION_RENAMED_NEW_NAME) is logged in the C:\\\n**ProgramData\\Adobe\\temp\\dhcpinit.dll.**\n\n|hash|C&C|\n|---|---|\n|bad4fba4b2863ddbf85aaabf1c77f60ea972dd2ea39d7b7963b862b0b4aacbb5|dns.seekvibega.com|\n|dc64e5497bbb2e128a821a382e1bd02a7057982913f2da673c4897c64ff5090c|news.dgwktifrn.com|\n|1df627dab5349caa21b7796747299cc00d5def8f1f9af2bfd93d61a74455151e|news.dgwktifrn.com|\n|6bce8eb669aa383397943579dd3432ea875227733b4430489fe985d326b5edb5|cent.myanmarnewsrecent.com|\n|3b9629122f33d5f354026923fdd3e499f43b01054c3dc74224aa242a4dd397c1|http.jmrmfitym.com|\n\n\n-----\n\nNAIKON – Traces from a Military Cyber-Espionage Operation\n\nThe criteria of filtering mainly consist of having an extension from the following list:\n\n##### doc, docx, pdf, ppt, pptx, xls, xlsx, rtf, txt, rar, zip, jpg, jpeg, bmp\n\nThe uploading component is responsible for periodic listing of the C:\\ProgramData\\Adobe\\temp folder and for\nuploading the found files to Dropbox using the public HTTP API. The credentials for the Dropbox account are encrypted\nin the binary along with the remote path. Another particularity of the upload module consists of encrypting the content\nof files with AES128-CBC using the “1234567890123459” value for key and IV.\n\nThe entire logic is implemented in a window procedure tied to a window named WindowsProject1 as the developers\npreferred to use the SetTimer function in combination with the WM_TIMER window event for periodic uploading. The\nupload may occur at a specific time of the day if there is a file named LICENSE in the root directory of the Dropbox.\nThe file contains strings that indicates the hours when to upload the collected files and such content looks like the one\npresented below:\n\n\n##### 07:00;08:00;09:00;09:20;10;11;12;14:30;15:30;16:30;17:30;19:30;20:30;21:30;01:00\n\n\nA file similar with sbiedll.dll is available on VirtusTotal.\n\nAnother tool suspected to be used for data exfiltration is swissfileknife binary that is available for public download\nfrom the osdn.net site. Despite the fact that there is evidence that RainyDay executes this tool multiple times, we can\nonly assume that it was used for exfiltration as per the available description of command line parameters.\n\n### Credential Harvesting\n\nThe evidences we collected show that there was used at least one tool for password dumping. One file we found\nat C:\\PerfLogs\\p8.exe is a sample of QuarksPwDump that certainly was used by RainyDay in order to obtain local\npasswords and domain cached credentials.\n\nIn C:\\ProgramData\\ folder, two other tools are found and their purpose is to collect browser credentials. The files we\nreferred to are:\n\n- %COMMON_APPDATA%\\bpd.exe is browserpassworddump\n\n- %COMMON_APPDATA%\\ has a suggestive pdb path - C:\\Users\\adnanonline\\documents\\visual studio 2015\\\nProjects\\chrome-passwords\\Release\\chrome-passwords.pdb\n\n\n-----\n\nNAIKON – Traces from a Military Cyber-Espionage Operation\n\n### Network Tools\n\nDuring the investigation we identified a netbios scanner, multiple samples of the Ladon scanner and two different\ntypes of proxy tools used in the operation. And all these tools contribute to the generation of a broader overview of the\ninfrastructure used by actors.\n\nThe netbios scanner has different file paths:\n\n_C:\\PerfLogs\\winhp.exe_\n\n_%WINDOWS%\\debug\\winhp.exe_\n\n_C:\\PerfLogs\\taskmgr.exe_\n\nIt was used for network inspection and for machine identification by scanning the private IP range X.X.0.0/24. This\ndiscovery step is particularly interesting as it characterizes how the actor behaves - immediately after the execution\nof the scanner, we noticed the execution of net.exe and ping.exe tools, which were probably used for checking if a\nmachine is up and running. Further actions correspond to the lateral movement step by running a command using\n**wmic.exe on a remote machine.**\n\nOther tool used by RainyDay is boost_proxy_client, called so because of use of the C++ boost libraries and because of\nthe pdb path found in a sample. We obtained 2 samples of the tool located at:\n\nabb48990eaabd5203c35bd26a0bb51e81e8eb2532d22d22fb2a6566bbda4c6a4 C:\\Recovery\\dwm.exe\n\nC:\\PerfLogs\\winlogin.exe\n\n56085b27e7145bb2cfbf2d33fba30359d1429b507e3b9251cfdced50bba1f07f c:\\perflogs\\winlogon.exe\n\nThere are a few differences between these two samples as the\n**56085b27e7145bb2cfbf2d33fba30359d1429b507e3b9251cfdced50bba1f07f has the pdb path set to Z:\\data\\cc0\\**\nboost_proxy\\boost_proxy_client_http_and_socks5\\Release\\boost_proxy_client.pdb and accepts 2 types of command\nlines: <host> <port> and <host><port><`http`|`socks5`><proxy_host><proxy_port>. The option for using a proxy is\nabsent in the abb48990eaabd5203c35bd26a0bb51e81e8eb2532d22d22fb2a6566bbda4c6a4, but it seems to encrypt\nthe traffic send to the destination as it contains OpenSSL code.\n\nInformation showing more about the actor’s infrastructure was extracted from the command line of these binaries and\nare as follows:\n\n150.109.184.127 3333\n\n150.109.184.127 4444\n\n150.109.178.252 2356\n\n150.109.184.127 4152\n\n150.109.184.127 1111\n\n150.109.184.127 4528\n\n150.109.184.127 792\n\n150.109.184.127 7859\n\n150.109.184.127 7954\n\n150.109.184.127 15784\n\nYet another reverse proxy tool from the actor’s arsenal is the Go-written tool RcSocks v1.0. We were able to collect 2\nsamples of this type: %COMMON_APPDATA%\\adobe\\scupdate.exe %WINDOWS%\\\\csc\\winsrvc.exe, where scupdate.\n**exe was executed by an instance of Rainyday with the “scupdate -c 124.156.241.24:8550” command line.**\n\n|abb48990eaabd5203c35bd26a0bb51e81e8eb2532d22d22fb2a6566bbda4c6a4|C:\\Recovery\\dwm.exe C:\\PerfLogs\\winlogin.exe|\n|---|---|\n|56085b27e7145bb2cfbf2d33fba30359d1429b507e3b9251cfdced50bba1f07f|c:\\perflogs\\winlogon.exe|\n\n\n-----\n\nNAIKON – Traces from a Military Cyber-Espionage Operation\n\n**C:\\ProgramData\\Adobe\\wusa64 was executed at the same time as the %COMMON_APPDATA%\\adobe\\scupdate.exe**\n**RcSocks sample. The command line given to the wusa64.exe indicates that** the intention of actor is to attempt a bruteforce attack against the SSH service on a local machine, likely to be used for lateral movement.\n\nMore samples of Ladon.exe (.Net version) were found during the investigation, but we didn’t find any arguments to\nconnect them to the operation other than the sample location (e.g. %WINDOWS%\\debug\\mmc.exe):\n\n3a10cf56e2402bd42658ba7bbac72afb81de7f37c5a3f881f891c503dc0c039f\n\nd09b3d2bd3488f09949445f19eb90bfabb2395be1bc7a20054c84c93a44700ff\n\n98598ea719deb88d0416a313c67a653c807d7b69d13229fcacc352404035e052\n\n### Other Tools\n\nThere are two more pieces of malicious tools we noticed to be run by the RainyDay that are worth describing:\n\n- C:\\cpqsystem\\logs.exe is a HexINI loader that decrypts a shellcode from a .ini file and runs it – we were unable to\nfind the payload used in the operation.\n\n**•** **C:\\PerfLogs\\winsrv.exe** is a downloader that was executed with the “47.241.127.190 443” command line.\n\n## Attribution\n\nOur research confidently points to an operation conducted by the Naikon group based on the extraction of the C&C\naddresses from Nebulae samples. The particular domain dns.seekvibega.com obtained from such a sample points out\nto the Naikon infrastructure, as previously documented in a CheckPoint research. Moreover, several C&C addresses in\nthe same component are suspected by ThreatConnect to belong to the Naikon infrastructure (e.g. www.wahatmrjn.\ncom).\n\nWe found more compelling evidence ito support our hypothesis during the triage of the suspicious files. The results\nof this process are the identification of a new case of side-loading and three malicious files (obtained from the same\nmachine where we noticed RainyDay and other IOCs) belonging to Aria-Body loader malware family, the family that was\npreviously reported to be used by Naikon:\n\n_Side-loading of Aria-Body loader_\n\n\n-----\n\nNAIKON – Traces from a Military Cyber-Espionage Operation\n\nThe C&C addresses of two of aria-body loader samples are rose.twifwkeyh.com and guinnbandesh.com as the third\nsample uses an IP from a private range.\n\nDespite the fact that we don’t have any visibility into what these samples of Aria-Body loader executed, they are\ncertainly connected with the operation we investigated, as there is a sample of Nebulae with the osde.twifwkeyh.com\nC&C address that uses a subdomain of the same domain twifwkeyh.com.\n\nThe previously mentioned Nebulae sample was used by the actor, as it was observed to be used in this operation\ntogether with outllib.dll that loads the RainyDay backdoor.\n\n## IOCS\n\n**2c4af3fa3918b715b3a0b3e5232196089b7ffcb2406ea01f5243ab5e04ecb2c8** SFX
