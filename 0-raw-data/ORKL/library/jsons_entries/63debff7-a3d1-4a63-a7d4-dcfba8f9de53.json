During the past few weeks, stright in the middle of the winter “holidays” (well, maybe if you live in a place where no COVID-19 lockdown was involved), many people re/started a studying program on cybersecurity. Some of them wrote to me asking if there is a way to detect common malware infections through network traces. So I thought it was a nice idea to share some personal and quick notes on that topic.\n\n BTW The short answer is: Yes there is a way. So it makes sense to trace Malware traffics for studying purposes, but also to find patterns for network detections in real environments.\n\n First of all you need to build your own laboratory, you might decide to build a dual VM systems, in which VM1 is the victim machine and VM2 is the traffic sniffer or you might decide to have a single victim machine and the main host sniffing and analyzing traffic streams. This is actually my favourite choice: a single MV called “victim” where I detonate malwares and the main host (the real machine in which the victim is virtualized) where the traffic tools are run. You need to create a certificate and manke it trusted from the victim machine in order to facilitate the SSL inspection. But this is not a post on how to build your own laboratory, if you are interested on building your own Malware laboratory the following 2 links are great starting points:\n\n Christophe wrote a very nice starting post on it: HERE Byte-Atlas followed on the topic showung how to harden the machine to reduce Malware Evasion: HERE\n\n After you set up your own laboratory you are ready to start your tracking process. Following some personal notes on my “network traceing days”. Please note the following collection is a mix-up of personal traced network traffic (and already published on gists/reports/repositories/pastebins etc) and the one I found from different friends/posts/reports/repositories as well during the past years.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Traffic Patterns\n\n The following paragraphs describe traffic traces captured by executing in a controlled environment some of the most known malware untill now.

Beacon includes a wealth of functionality to the attacker, including, but not limited to command execution, key logging, file transfer, SOCKS proxying, privilege escalation, mimikatz, port scanning and lateral movement. Beacon is in- memory/file-less, in that it consists of stageless or multi-stage shellcode that once loaded by exploiting a vulnerability or executing a shellcode loader, will reflectively load itself into the memory of a process without touching the disk. It supports C2 and staging over HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, SMB named pipes as well as forward and reverse TCP; Beacons can be daisy-chained. Cobalt Strike comes with a toolkit for developing shellcode loaders, called Artifact Kit.\n\n The Beacon implant has become popular amongst targeted attackers and criminal users as it is well written, stable, and highly customizable.\n\n Following a general profile\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\nGET /Mdt7 HTTP/1.1\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64;\nTrident/5.0; NP06)\nHost: 192.168.1.44\nConnection: Keep-Alive\nCache-Control: no-cache\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nDate: Wed, 16 Nov 2019 02:13:32 GMT\nContent-Type: application/octet-stream\nContent-Length: 213589\n.......\nw.z....=..........C.D.'.'Z.2....:1....R..1...1.......1.9.t...^.......3.Q.3.R.~...~....\nL^.............................................`.....W...?...O...=...^...1...T...:....\n.W.E.3k..a....9..l.T..k...........J......;J.._.k...$......J....h...'..qD\nGET /push HTTP/1.1\nAccept: */*\nCookie:\nTwJl1o2Nzk3+xmC39FsNTbyJPGHyNxllFZ8wZUwR831SYmTwrxoGydXQGF1ej89K1t0rTLgzjd95c8127hlZ6S\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; Windows NT 6.1; Trident/5.0;\nBOIE9;ENXA)\nHost: 192.168.1.44\nConnection: Keep-Alive\nCache-Control: no-cache\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nDate: Wed, 16 Nov 2019 02:017:31 GMT\nContent-Type: application/octet-stream\nContent-Length: 0\n\n## Following Amazon C2 profile (from external sources)\nGET /s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1/167-3294888-0262949/field-keywords=books HTTP/1.1\nHost: www.amazon.com\nAccept: */*\nCookie: skin=noskin;sessiontoken=MM4bZQ5WUPUrn7TPQuCWct6G+WGXZaLdezMQVEv8PHnB7tnvTk7ct3W71pQmn2NMJQD7IFbjPnKJV27t\nhit=s-24KU11BB82RZSYGJ3BDK|1419899012996\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/7.0; rv:11.0) like Gecko\nConnection: Keep-Alive\nCache-Control: no-cache\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nDate: Fri, 13 Dec 2019 17:48:39 GMT\nServer: Server\nx-amz-id-1: THKUYEZKCKPGY5T42PZT\nx-amz-id-2: a21yZ2xrNDNtdGRsa212bGV3YW85amZuZW9ydG5rZmRuZ2tmZGl4aHRvNDVpbgo=\nX-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN\nContent-Encoding: gzip\nContent-Length: 0\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n## Following a safebrowsing profile (from external sources)\n```\nGET /safebrowsing/ref/eNKSXUTdWXGYAMHYg2df0Ev1wVrA7yp0T-WrSHSB53oha HTTP/1.1\nAccept-Language: en-US\nAccept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8\nAccept-Encoding: gzip\nHost: novote.azureedge.net\nCookie:\nPREF=ID=foemmgjicmcnhjlacgackacadbclcmnfoeaeeignjhiphdgidlmahkgbchcahclpfcadjnegckejpi\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like\nGecko) Chrome/55.0.2883.87 Safari/537.36\nConnection: Keep-Alive\nCache-Control: no-cache\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Encoding: gzip\nAge: 1609\nAlternate-Protocol: 80:quic\nCache-Control: public,max-age=172800\nContent-Type: application/vnd.google.safebrowsing-chunk\nDate: Fri, 22 Nov 2019 13:34:50 GMT\nServer: ECAcc (frb/67BC)\nX-Content-Type-Options: nosniff\nX-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN\nX-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block\nContent-Length: 82480\n\n Danabot\n\n Proofpoints describes DanaBot as the latest example of malware focused on persistence and stealing useful information that can later be monetized rather than demanding an immediate ransom from victims. The social engineering in the low-volume DanaBot campaigns we have observed so far has been well-crafted, again pointing to a renewed focus on “quality over quantity” in email-based threats. DanaBot’s modular nature enables it to download additional components, increasing the flexibility and robust stealing and remote monitoring capabilities of this banker.\n\n It looks like TLS traffic, but it really isen’t. The matching flag is on “24 01 00 00” pattern and following 24 byte first packet.

After being used in the Syrian civil war in 2011, Lesuer decided to stop developing the trojan. Indeed, DarkComet is able to enable control over a compromised system through use of a simple graphic user interface. Experts think that this user friendliness is the key of its mass success.\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\nBF7CAB464EFBA57DAD495BECB15D8B4C57F0BE821AEF052DF1C27F08DDFC328EB3FE9F5699707BCDC8C751\n\n## Dridex loader\n\n OxCERT blog describes Dridex as “an evasive, information-stealing malware variant; its goal is to acquire as many credentials as possible and return them via an encrypted tunnel to a Command-and-Control (C&C) server. These C&C servers are numerous and scattered all over the Internet, if the malware cannot reach one server it will try another. For this reason, network-based measures such as blocking the C&C IPs is effective only in the short-term.”\n According to MalwareBytes, “Dridex uses an older tactic of infection by attaching a Word document that utilizes macros to install malware. However, once new versions of Microsoft Office came out and users generally updated, such a threat subsided because it was no longer simple to infect a user with this method.”\n IBM X-Force discovered “a new version of the Dridex banking Trojan that takes advantage of a code injection technique called AtomBombing to infect systems. AtomBombing is a technique for injecting malicious code into the ‘atom tables’ that almost all versions of Windows uses to store certain application data. It is a variation of typical code injection attacks that take advantage of input validation errors to insert and to execute malicious code in a legitimate process or application. Dridex v4 is the first malware that uses the AtomBombing process to try and infect systems.”\nGET /function.php?3b3988df-c05b-4fca-93cc-8f82af0e3d2b HTTP/1.1\nHost: masteronare.com\nConnection: Keep-Alive\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nServer: nginx\nDate: Tue, 05 Nov 2019 20:32:12 GMT\nContent-Type: application/octet-stream\nContent-Length: 455830\nConnection: keep-alive\nKeep-Alive: timeout=60\nAccept-Ranges: bytes\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=5dc1dc4cd884c.pdf\n7Y2FGZnZ2enZ2dnZydnZ2dhgYD3Z2e1B2dnZ2dnZ2dnZmdnZ2dnZ2dnZ2dnZ2dnZ2dnZ2dnZ2dnZ2dnZ2dnZ2d\nPOST / HTTP/1.1\nHost: 194.99.22.193\nContent-Length: 3442\nConnection: Close\nCache-Control: no-cache\n..5......[,h?])moo..;.Y..\nv..jq..........G.0vR...@ ..6tw..<.{It.y\n#l.K..8....v...v......=.+.......Q..v..P5...y...uhTqR.\n..v.QoM..o.I.l...>.....p.....Rt...............\n\n Emotet\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n## While Emotet historically was a banking malware organized in a botnet, nowadays Emotet is mostly seen as infrastructure as a service for content delivery. For example, since mid 2018 it is used by Trickbot for installs, which may also lead to ransomware attacks using Ryuk, a combination observed several times against high-profile targets. It is always stealing information from victims but what the criminal gang behind it did, was to open up another business channel by selling their infrastructure delivering additional malicious software. From malware analysts it has been classified into epochs depending on command and control, payloads, and delivery solutions which change over time.\n\n The following trace is an external trace not updated to the last versions\n```\nPOST /mult/tlb/ HTTP/1.1\nReferer: http://69.162.169.173/mult/tlb/\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nDNT: 1\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/7.0;\nSLCC2; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; Media Center PC\n6.0; .NET4.0C; .NET4.0E)\nHost: 69.162.169.173:8080\nContent-Length: 468\nConnection: Keep-Alive\nCache-Control: no-cache\n5Grps=L1sIwg4a7XWGwPpN9LOBzMiBXsZTP33ixo%2FUspmgBLoaYr0K7KnwvoUER9%2B5NzIxpTHgpSTeVRZM\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nServer: nginx\nDate: Mon, 07 Oct 2019 13:38:33 GMT\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\nContent-Length: 148\nConnection: keep-alive\n.^ta.I..Z\n.._AJ*..=._...5-...F.L{>...`.c.....~.|.h...@.E...2.Z|U..W..M....b......X.FA....x.....\\\n{pi.b....Cz......>D..yQ........G.q...4?..\n\n Formbook\n\n FormBook is yet another Stealer malware. Like most stealer malware, it performs many operations to evade AV vendors when deploying itself on a victim’s machine. And of course as we see with Ursnif, Hancitor, Dridex and other trojans, there are many variants with more than one way to receive the payload.\n\n In the past year the threat actor’s favorite method of distributing FormBook has been via malspam and the use of CVE-2017-8570, using an .RTF file format with malicious code to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n Patter suggestion.

This first version of Gozi was developed by Nikita Kurmin, and he borrowed code from Ursnif aka Snifula, a spyware developed by Alexey Ivanov around 2000, and some other kits. Gozi v1.0 thus had a formgrabber module and often is classified as Ursnif aka Snifula. In September 2010, the source code of a particular Gozi CRM dll version was leaked, which led to Vawtrak/Neverquest (in combination with Pony) via Gozi Prinimalka (a slightly modified Gozi v1.0) and Gozi v2.0 (aka ‘Gozi ISFB’ aka ‘ISFB’ aka Pandemyia).
