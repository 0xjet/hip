Introduction\n\nRemote access software is a type of computer program\nthat allows an individual to have full remote control of\nthe device where the software is installed. Remote Access\n_Tool refers to a type of remote access software used for_\nbenign purposes, such as TeamViewer [1] or Ammyy Admin [2], which are common tools used by billions of users\nworldwide. Remote Access Trojans (RAT) are a special type\nof remote access software commonly used for malicious\npurposes, where (i) the installation is done without user\nconsent, (ii) the remote control is done secretly, and (iii)\nthe program hides itself in the system to avoid detection.\nThe distinction between tools and trojans was created by\nthe information security industry to distinguish benign from\nmalicious RATs, however in the underground, attackers\nclaim all RATs are Remote Access Tools.\nEarly Remote Access Trojans were used for pranks and\nfor fun, to showcase skills, and to brag in hacking forums.\nDeveloping your own RAT was an entry level skill that inexperienced users were somehow expected to rapidly acquire.\nWebsites like megasecurity.org were used to list and publish\nnew RATs, many of which were never developed further.\nWhile the challenge of building highly functional RATs\n\n\n### Sebastian Garcia\n_Department of Computer Science_\n_Czech Technical University_\n_Prague, Czech Republic_\n_sebastian.garcia@agents.fel.cvut.cz_\n\nremains to today, their use has evolved. In the last decade\nmore and more RATs were used in espionage, financial\nand state sponsored attacks [3]–[5]. While many of them\nhad their source code leaked or open sourced, the market\nfor Fully Undetectable (FUD) RATs and special plugins\nmatured. Nowadays, RATs have become a commodity.\nDespite the abundance of reports on individual RAT\nfamilies and attacks that use them [6], there is no previous\nresearch that looks at RATs as a whole. The growth and\nevolution of RATs appears to have escaped public attention\nso far. The lack of a more generalist research hinders\nthe understanding and development of new techniques and\nmethods to better detect them.\nThis paper aims to start a discussion on RATs as a\nunique phenomenon that requires further study. We argue\nthat in the last 10 years a shift has occurred in the threat\nlandscape where RATs have become a commodity. This\nwork analyzes the growth of Remote Access Trojans, describes their key technological elements, their functionality,\nand analyzes how they propagate. Furthermore, this work\npresents a timeline of the last 30 years of RATs evolution,\na detailed overview of the most well-known RATs during\n2019-2020, and an analysis of how they have been commercialized.\nThe main question this research explores is, are Remote\nAccess Trojans a commodity in the underground? Answering this question, the contributions of this paper are:\n\n_•_ The first and most comprehensive timeline of the\nlast 30 years of RATs.\n\n_•_ An overview of the commoditization of the most\nwell-known RATs in 2019-2020.\n\n_•_ A first analysis on the types of attacks and attackers\nusing RATs.\n\n## 2. Methodology\n\nTo address the analysis of RATs we first searched and\nmethodologically analyzed a comprehensive list of Remote\nAccess Trojans since their first public appearance in 1996\nuntil 2018. These RATs, shown in the timeline of Figure 1,\nwere found from public sources and inquiries with the\ncommunity, and are the base tools analyzed in this work.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe years 2019 and 2020 were not included in this research\nas the information available for this time is at the moment\nnot comprehensive and incomplete.\nWe chose a small subset of RATs in order to study their\nspecific characteristics, their users and how they are commercialized. These RATs were selected using the following\nmethodology. First, we searched on well-known forums for\nRATs that users were talking about or recommending to each\nother in the period from January 2019 to March 2020. We\nconsulted HackForums [7], Sinister.ly [8], and Nulled [9].\nSecond, taking as an input the list of RATs created in the\nprevious step, we searched for those RATs in websites that\nwere selling hacking tools, software, and other goods. Third,\nwe limited the scope of RATs to those that were being sold\nin two or more of the above mentioned marketplaces. Fourth,\nwe assembled the final list of RATs to study: WebMonitor\nRAT, Android Voyager RAT, Remcos RAT, SpyNote RAT,\nLuminosity Link RAT, Omni Android RAT, Ozone RAT,\nImminent Monitor RAT, NanoCore RAT, NetWire RAT and\nCyberGate RAT. Fifth, further information was collected\nfrom public intelligence sources such as blogs, news articles\nand forums on each of the selected RAT.\n\n## 3. Overview of Remote Access Trojans\n\nIn order to define a common ground to further the\nunderstanding of RATs, we first introduce some of the key\ntechnical elements of every Remote Access Trojan. Then\nwe present a timeline showing the growth of RATs over\nthe last 30 years. Finally we discuss common functionality\nfound among RATs.\n\n### 3.1. Key Technical Elements\n\nRemote Access Trojans have two key elements: client\nand server. Additional RATs components include the\n_builder, plugins and crypter. A RAT server is the program_\ninstalled on the victim’s device. The server is configured to\nconnect back to the attacker. The client is the program used\nby the attacker to monitor and control infected victims: it\nallows the visualization of all active victims infections, displays general information about each infection, and allows\nto manually perform individual actions on each victim.\nThe builder is a program that allows to create new\nRAT servers with different configurations. When attackers\nmove infrastructure quickly, launch new attacks, and require\nflexibility, builders save time and provide agility.\nRATs come with certain fixed functionality. To add more\ncapabilities, some RATs rely on plugins. Not all RATs offer\nthis capability, however the most used ones do, and good\nplugins are craved by the cybercrime community. These\nplugins are one of the main differentiators in terms of cost\nin the underground market.\nTo be more efficient and hard to detect, attackers use\ncrypters to make the RAT servers Fully Undetectable (FUD).\nCrypters are programs that take a given program, read the\ncode, encrypt it with a key, and automatically create a new\nprogram that contains the encrypted code and key to decrypt\n\n\nit. Upon execution the key will be used to automatically\ndecrypt the original program. Crypters are used to avoid\ndetection by anti-virus engines.\n\n### 3.2. Thirty Years Timeline of RATs\n\nTo better understand the growth and evolution of RATs,\nit was necessary to investigate and build a corpus of the most\nwell-known Remote Access Trojans in history that had the\nkey technical elements described previously. We were able\nto find, reference and document many RATs since 1996 to\n2018 by looking at reports, code, and forums. These RATs\nwere also grouped in families, with slight variations of the\nsame RATs grouped together. The final list contains 337\nunique families of RATs, registering the first time seen, or\ndate of the first public report about them.\nThe collected information was used to build the first and\nmost comprehensive timeline of RATs to date. The timeline\nis illustrated in Figure 1, and it is divided in three phases\nshown in the figure as different dotted lines. The first phase\nis from 1990 to 1999; the second phase is from 2000 to\n2009; and the third phase is from 2010 to 2018. In Figure 1\nwe also highlight in bold pink color the 11 RATs that will\nbe analyzed in more detail in the following sections.\nThe oldest RAT was first developed in 1996 [10], however legitimate Remote Access Tools were first created in\n1989 [11]. Since then, the number of RATs has grown\nrapidly. Figure 1 illustrates 337 of the most well-known RAT\nfamilies during 1996–2018. The first period, 1996-1999,\nwas marked by home-made RATs. In these years, everyone\nmade their own RAT, however these did not prosper nor\nwere heavily used. Among the most prominent ones were\nBack Orifice, Sub7 and Netbus, which together defined a\ngeneration by being innovative and disruptive. The second\nperiod, 2000-2009, showed a slight growth of more mature\nRATs, that were intended for fun but were started to be used\nfor attacks and profit. Among the highlights of this period\nare Gh0st, PoisonIvy and DarkComet. The third period,\n2010-2018, showed an important shift. RATs became a\ncommodity. The market matured, RAT sellers were expected\nto provide support, new features, and in some cases even to\nhost part of the infrastructure.\nThe growth of RATs in the last decade depends on\na combination of multiple factors. The maturity of the\ncybercrime ecosystem, the specialization of work in the\nunderground communities, and interdependence of threat\nactors are some of the key factors that led to an increase\nin the demand of new and better malicious software, and\nRATs among them. To understand the real cause however,\na more extended analysis and study is needed.\n\n### 3.3. Functionality\n\nThe server-side functionality offered by each RAT will\nvary depending on the targeted platform and the intent for\nwhich the RAT was created. There is not standardized set of\nfeatures among RATs, however certain features are expected,\nnamely:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. Timeline of 337 well-known Remote Access Trojans families during 1996-2018, ordered by year of first seen or reported by the community.\nThe timeline is divided in three phases marked by dotted lines. The last phase clearly shows a significant growth compared with the previous phases. In\nbold pink we highlight the 11 RATs this research focuses on.\n\n\n-----\n\n_•_ Webcam: take screenshots or full video recording\nthrough the victim’s webcam.\n\n_•_ Microphone: access the microphone to record audio.\n\n_•_ Display: take screenshots or full screen recording of\nthe victim’s desktop.\n\n_•_ Keylogger: capture keystrokes from the victim.\n\n_•_ System: perform system operations such as retrieving system information, file management, hard drive\nand RAM access, installing programs, and other.\n\n_•_ Peripherals: access to peripherals devices including\nBluetooth, CD/DVD reader, and others.\n\nThe quality of the RATs however does not only depend\non the server side functionality. On the client-side, the\nfollowing factors are considered important:\n\n_•_ Stealthiness: the more stealth and hard to detect the\nRAT is, the better.\n\n_•_ Stability: server and client stability are paramount\nqualities of a successful RAT.\n\n_•_ Graphical interface: the more user friendly the client\ncontrol panel, the better.\n\n_•_ Encryption: traffic encryption is very important to\nhide the content in the network.\n\n_•_ Dependencies: the fewer dependencies needed for a\nRAT to work, the better.\n\n### 3.4. Propagation Methods\n\nThe distribution and propagation of Remote Access Trojans rely heavily on social engineering. Social engineering\nrefers to the psychological manipulation of humans into\nacting in a desired way, usually with the aim of obtaining\ninformation or in this case, installing a malicious program.\nTraditional phishing and spear phishing campaigns are\nthe preferred method to distribute RATs using malicious\nattachments [12]–[15]. Some Facebook pages were also\nknown for luring users to install RATs [16]. These pages\ncontain links to download what looked like normal software,\nwhich in reality would download RATs. Channels in secure\nmessengers such as Telegram and WhatsApp were also\nknown to spread malicious links that would lead to RATs\n\n[17], [18].\n\n## 4. Commoditization of RATs\n\nJust like other types of malware, RATs are openly\ncommercialized. This section provides insights on eleven\nselected RATs that were more recommended by users in\nforums during 2019-2020. This section will focus on their\ncharacteristics, special features, and provide insights of their\ncommercialization on different marketplaces.\nBased on the analysis of the market it is possible to say\nthat far from being custom-made unique tools, RATs have\nbecome a commodity. They have become a group of standardized products that are not very different from each other.\nThe variation of prices is not given by the functionality of\nthe RATs per se, but instead by the sellers themselves being\n\n\nable to offer additional services, extended functionality or\ntechnical support. No matter the skill level, attackers are\nable to chose from a wide range of very affordable options\nand adjust their attack to the final product selected. Most\nRATs do not have a huge technological advantage, but better\nreviews, recommendations and in the end, better marketing.\n\n### 4.1. Overview of the Eleven Selected RATs\n\nThe selected RATs, as summarized in Table 1, are\nWebMonitor RAT, Android Voyager RAT, Remcos RAT,\nSpyNote RAT, Luminosity Link RAT, Omni Android\nRAT, Ozone-RAT, Imminent Monitor RAT, NanoCore RAT,\nNetWire RAT and CyberGate RAT. These RATs are also\nhighlighted on Figure 1 in bold pink color.\nCyberGate RAT was first seen in 2011 [19]. The client is\nwritten in Delphi, the server is believed to be written in C++\nand is very lightweight, 40 KB uncompressed. It seems to\nshare part of its code with an earlier RAT known as Xtreme\nRAT from 2010, whose source code was leaked [20]. This\nRAT targets specifically Windows machines, both 32Bit and\n64Bit. Its key functionalities include keylogger, screenshot\nlogger, password recovery and microphone capture.\nNetWire RAT was first seen in 2012 [21] and is multiplatform, being able to target not only Windows machines,\nbut also Mac, Linux and Android. Both client and server\nare written in C. It offers full remote access with traditional\nfunctionalities such as keylogger, system management, password recovery and others. It allows heavy customization.\nImminent Monitor RAT, also known as IM-RAT, was\nfirst seen in 2012 [22]. It targets Windows machines, and\nboth client and server are written in .NET. Imminent Monitor was commercialized as a benign administration tool,\nhowever researchers confirmed that some of its functionalities made the RAT undetectable for the victim, including\nrecording from the webcam undetected by turning off the\nwebcam light [23]. A version of Imminent Monitor allowed\nattackers to run a cryptocurrency miner on the infected\nmachine.\nNanoCore RAT was first publicly seen in 2013, while\nits author started coding it on late 2012 [24]. Bot client and\nserver are written in .NET. The source code of NanoCore\nhas been leaked multiple times, and while the original\nauthor was arrested there are versions of it still being sold\ntoday. NanoCore was reported to be used for state-sponsored\nattacks [3]. Among its features it offers a plugin system to\nextend its functionality, remote chat, and uPnP support.\nLuminosity Link was first seen in 2015 [25], targets\nWindows machines and both client and server are written in\n.NET. The source code was leaked, however it is still being\nsold even though the author was arrested [26].\nOmni Android RAT, also known as OmniRAT, was first\nseen in 2015 [27]. This RAT is multi-platform, allowing\nto target Windows, Mac, Linux and Android victims. For\nAndroid devices it allows to retrieve a high number of information, including battery level, widgets installed, Bluetooth,\ncalls, and many others.\n\n\n-----\n\nTABLE 1. TECHNICAL OVERVIEW OF ELEVEN OF THE MOST COMMON RATS DURING 2019-2020\n\n|RAT|First Seen|Targeted Platform|Used in targeted attacks|Client Source Code Language|Server Source Code Language|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|CyberGate RAT NetWire RAT Imminent Monitor RAT NanoCore RAT Luminosity Link RAT Omni Android RAT Ozone RAT Remcos RAT SpyNote RAT Android Voyager RAT WebMonitor RAT|2011 2012 2012 2013 2015 2015 2015 2016 2016 2017 2017|Windows Windows, Mac, Linux & Android Windows Windows Windows Windows, Mac, Linux & Android Windows Windows Android Android Windows, Linux, Mac & Google OS|Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Unknown Unknown Unknown|Delphi C .NET .NET .NET Java C++ C++ Visual Basic Java C++|C++ C .NET .NET .NET Java C++ C++ Java Java C++|\n\n\nOzone-RAT was created in 2015 [28]. Both client and\nserver are written in C++, and it targets specifically Windows machines. It offers traditional functionalities such as\nremote desktop, keylogger and system management. One of\nthe main highlights of this RAT is that it offers a hidden\nVNC functionality.\nRemcos RAT was first seen in 2016 [29]. Both client\nand server are written in C++ making it lightweight. Remcos\ntargets 32Bit and 64Bit Windows machines. Its functionality\nincludes uploading and downloading files, system management, and keylogger. There are several variants observed in\nthe wild, which suggest that the source code may have been\nleaked.\nSpyNote RAT version 2 was first seen in 2016 [30],\nhowever it may have been created earlier. The client is\nwritten in Visual Basic, and the server in Java. It targets\nAndroid devices. Among its functionality it includes the\nability to access contacts, listen to calls, access front and\nback cameras, read SMS, and system management without\nrequiring root access. The builder of SpyNote was leaked\n\n[31] and thus, multiple versions have been observed of this\nRAT.\nAndroid Voyager RAT, also known as Voyager RAT, was\nfirst seen in 2017 [32]. Both client and server are written in\nJava, and its author claims to be original and not based\nfrom other leaked RAT. It targets Android devices. The\nfunctionality offered depends on whether there is root access\non the device or not. Among the novel features, it claims that\nwith root access it can survive factory reset on the Android\ndevice.\nWebMonitor RAT was first seen in 2017 [33]. Both\nclient and server are written in C++. WebMonitor targets\nWindows, Linux, Mac and Google OS. It’s designed to be an\n_enterprise class RAT able to compete with TeamViewer and_\nother commercial remote access software. It offers stability,\nfull remote control, and the management of clients through\na web page being multi-platform on the client side as well.\n\n**4.1.1. RAT Features. In terms of functionality, all the**\nselected RATs provide the same basic features as described\nin Section 3.3. These features however are complemented\nby additional features that characterize and differentiate\nRATs among each other. However until today, there is not a\n\n\ncommon standardization of features to compare RATs. For\ninstance, for the CyberGate RAT we could find more than 70\nindividual features [34], while for NetWire the user manual\nonly lists a few dozen [35]. While at first sight CyberGate\nseems to have more features, that is not the case. The only\ndifference is that the features described for CyberGate are\nmore detailed than those for NetWire, making a comparison\na difficult task.\n\n### 4.2. Marketplaces\n\nJust like other malware, RATs are openly commercialized through forums and marketplaces. In this paper we focus on six marketplaces selling RATs among other hacking\ntools and services. The selected marketplaces are shown on\nTable 2, along with a summary of the RATs offered in each\nmarket and their prices.\nAlthough the majority of well-known RATs are opensource or had their code leaked, sellers commercialize RAT\npackages. These include the fully undetectable RAT with\nplugins and its builder. Sellers may sell the RAT once, or\nmay offer subscriptions for a limited time. Subscriptions are\nsold in tiers, such as Basic, Premium and Pro, or Startup,\nSmall Business and Enterprise. When sold via subscriptions,\nthe offerings vary according to the number of simultaneous\nclients, functionality, number of plugins included, and concurrent tasks executed.\nDaVinciCoders (codevinci.pw) is a website that sells\nMicrosoft Office exploits, crypters, keyloggers, RATs and\nbotnets. It has four RATs for sale: Imminent Monitor,\nNanoCore, Luminosity Link, and Ozone RAT. It offers\nplugins and support. This market sells the RAT, without\nlicensing, thus having lower prices than other markets. The\npayment is handled via rocketr.net, however at the time of\nwriting, the site has banned the products due to violations\nof their terms of services.\nSecret Hacker Society (secrethackersociety.com) is\na website that sells exploits, botnets, RATs, keyloggers,\ncrypters, tutorials and hardware devices. It has nine RATs\nfor sale with prices ranging from 55 USD to 200 USD.\nSome RATs are offered through licensing and special FUD\nfeatures, leading to higher prices than other markets. Payments are handled via perfectmoney.is or Bitcoin.\n\n\n-----\n\nTABLE 2.

It has five RATs on sale on two tiers: Basic and Pro.\nPro licenses are more expensive as their include typically\nlifetime access, technical support, one week money back\nguarantee, and more than one device licensing. The seller\ndoesn’t perform direct sales, customers need to send an\nemail request and all exchange is done privately.\nDorian Docs (doriandocs.com) is a website that sells\naccounts, RATs, fake IDs and fake documents. It has four\nRATs on sale and each RAT has a different tier: single price,\nBusiness/Professional, Startup/Small Business/Business, 1\nmonth/3 months/6 months/Lifetime. Payments are made\nwith cryptocurrency, accepting Bitcoin, Monero, Ethereum\nand Litecoin.\nFUD Exploits (fudexploits.com) is a website that sells\nbotnets, crypters, passports, RATs, and other products. It has\nten RATs on sale, and it offers different RAT packages at\ndifferent prices, varying on versions, number of plugins, and\nsupport. Payments are made using Bitcoin.\nUltra Hacks (ultrahacks.org) is a website that sells\ntutorials, RATs, botnets, hardware, and services. It has five\nRATs on sale, only two of them are offered in two tiers\nProfessional/Premium, the rest is offered in a single option.\nThe seller accepts payments in Bitcoin, Monero, Litecoin,\ndirect by transfer SEPA, cash on delivery and Perfect Money.\nThe variation in price depends on the how fully undetectable the RAT is and on the type of license purchased, if\nany. In terms of detection, a RAT can be detectable, fully\nundetectable at runtime, fully undetectable at scan time (AV\nscans), or both. The price will also depend on the type of\nlicense. Markets such as DaVinciCoders sell just the RAT\nwithout any type of license, leading to lower prices. Markets\nsuch as FUD Exploits sell the license to use the RAT for a\nnumber of devices, typically 1 device. Licenses can be for\na finite time, or infinite, leading also to higher prices.\n\n## 5. Characterizing Attacks\n\nTo better understand the market and context of these\nRATs, this section provides a first analysis of different\nknown types of attacks done with RATs and the different\n\n\nsectors or type of crimes they focus on. In contrast with\nbotnets, RATs are precision tools that excel in targeted\nattacks meant to extract specific information from victims.\nRAT attacks differ from most malware attacks in several\naspects. First, contrary to botnets where an attacker controls\nall the bots simultaneously, attackers control each RAT\ninfection manually. Second, due to this individual control\nof each victim, the sequence of actions on the victims may\nnever be the same in two infections. Third, the number\nof simultaneous infections that an attacker can control are\nlimited by the skill of the attacker. No attacker will be able\nto control half a million victims as with botnets.\n\n### 5.1. Business Email Compromise\n\nBusiness Email Compromise (BEC) is a type of scam\ndirected at companies or organizations that pay their suppliers via wire transfers [36]. In BEC attacks, attackers use\ndifferent techniques with the aim of redirecting the transfer\nof funds to attackers’ accounts instead of the legitimate ones,\nthus stealing the money. While traditionally information\nstealers were the preferred tool in BEC attacks, there has\nbeen a shift and nowadays the use of RATs is becoming the\nnorm [37].\n\n### 5.2. Espionage\n\nRATs are designed for spying on victims, and cyber\nespionage is the type of attack where they excel at. Cyber\nespionage attackers may develop their own RATs [38],\n\n[39], or use well-known commercial RATs for their operations. Advanced attackers, like the Tonto APT group,\nhas been known to use the same self-developed RAT for\nover a decade [40]. There are pros and cons of using wellknown RATs for a highly confidential operation. Using wellknown RATs may leave unnecessary tracks that could lead\nto identify the attacker, and the RAT may not have all the\nneeded functionality. Additionally, commercially available\nRATs may not provide enough stability or the stealthiness\nrequired for cyber espionage activities. However, developing\na custom-made RAT can clearly help identify the attacking\ngroup very easily and help in attribution.\n\n\n-----\n\n### 5.3. Targeted Attacks\n\nTargeted attacks are attacks that are carefully planned,\ntarget a very narrow set of victims, and have often a\nspecific goal. RATs are widely used in this type of\nattacks. From the eleven RATs mentioned in the previous section, 9 of them were used in targeted attacks [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49]. The\nmajority of the reports on RATs used on targeted attacks\nfocus on the delivery method and not on how the malware\nwas used. It is generally understood that RATs are mainly\nused to monitor the infected device, steal documents, and\nsteal credentials that can be used to move laterally on the\ncompromised organization.\n\n## 6. Characterizing Attackers\n\nRAT users are not homogeneous. They can be separated in three groups according to their aim: (i) users\nthat use RATs for educational purposes, fun or pranks, (ii)\nfor advanced attacks and espionage activities, and (iii) for\ncybercrime (whether selling RATs to other actors or buying\nRATs for attacking).\n\n### 6.1. Educational Purposes\n\nAttackers using RATs for educational purposes, fun or\npranks rarely purchase commercial RATs. They will likely\nwrite their own or modify existing ones. The renowned\ndevelopment platform GitHub [50] contains dozens or hundreds self-made RATs created and shared publicly with\nthe disclaimer of being for education purposes only. In\nunderground forums, the hacker community still believes\nthat real hackers will create their own RAT, which incentives\nthis activity.\n\n### 6.2. Advanced Attacks\n\nState sponsored attackers and cyber crime organizations\nare believed to create their own tools customized to their\nown needs. An exemplary case in this category is the Tonto\nAPT Group that developed their own RAT and used it for\nmore than a decade [40]. The use of open source tools\nhowever may be useful in some scenarios to give false flags\nor as a distraction.\n\n### 6.3. Cybercrime\n\nTraditional cybercrime groups are the ones engaged in\ncommercializing RATs. Sellers will use available RATs,\nmodify or enhance them, package them and sell them. They\nwill offer technical support, tutorials, and hosting services.\nBuyers do not want to get absorbed in technical details and\nprogramming, they look to focus on the attacks. Buyers rely\non sellers to provide stable tools, with support, and ability\nto develop further modules for them in case they need them.\n\n\n## 7. Conclusion\n\nWe have presented a first overview of the growth of\nRemote Access Trojans by visualizing the 337 most wellknown families during 1996-2018. This generalist overview\nprovides an understanding of how this type of malicious\nsoftware has grown over the last three decades. Insights\non eleven of the most prominent RATs during 2019-2020\nregarding their commercialization in online marketplaces\nshowed that RATs are technologically not so different from\neach other. The main differences are in prices due to the\nadded features or additional services offered by the sellers\nthemselves. While it is still believed that real hackers will\ncreate their own RAT, business oriented cybercriminals will\nlook for stability, simplicity, support, and guarantee; thus\nbuying RATs instead of crafting their own. These commercial characteristics of RATs mark them as a commodity.\nShifts in cybercriminal activities continue to happen and\nRATs are used more and more in all type of attacks. Their\ncontinual growth challenges current detection methods and\nasks for further research that focuses on RATs as a general\nmalware class and not only in individual RAT families.\n\n## Acknowledgment\n\nThe authors would like to thank the Czech Technical\nUniversity for its support. The authors would also like to\nthank all the individual researchers that shared information\nand helped during the last three years in building the RAT\ntimeline.\n\n## References\n\n[1] _TeamViewer: remote access, remote control and remote support_\n_[solution, TeamViewer Germany GmbH.
