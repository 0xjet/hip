As new platforms and applications gain in popularity, attackers often\ndevelop ways to use them to achieve their mission objectives. Communications platforms\nlike Telegram, Signal, WhatsApp and others have been abused over the past several years\nto spread malware, used for command and control communications, and otherwise\nleveraged for nefarious purposes.\n\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic spread across the globe in 2020, organizations made\nsignificant changes to their work routines across virtually every industry. One major shift\nwas the move to remote working arrangements which coincided with increased reliance\n\n\n-----\n\n[on new interactive communications platforms like Discord and Slack. While both of these](https://discord.com/)\nplatforms have existed for some time, recent changes to employee workflows have led to\nan increased reliance upon them for conducting business. In many cases, these platforms\nprovide rich environments that can be used for communication and collaboration\nprofessionally and personally. As the pandemic continued, we observed several threat\nactors changing their tactics, techniques and procedures to compensate for these new\nenterprise workflows. We previously described how many threat actors began taking\n[advantage of public interest in COVID-19 related information here and here. Over the](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2020/02/coronavirus-themed-malware.html)\npast year, we have also observed a significant increase in the abuse of many of these\ncollaboration platforms to facilitate malware attacks against various organizations.\nAttackers are looking to spread ransomware via these rooms and use the platforms to\nspread traditional malspam lures used to infect victims.\n\n## Collaboration platforms for malware distribution\n\nAttackers are increasingly abusing the communications platforms that many\norganizations use to facilitate employee communications. This allows them to circumvent\nperimeter security controls and maximize infection capabilities. Over the past year,\nadversaries are increasingly relying on these platforms as part of the infection process. In\nthis blog, we will describe how these platforms are being used across three major phases\nof malware attacks:\n\nDelivery\nComponent retrieval\nC2 and data exfiltration\n\nThese platforms provide an attractive option for hosting malicious content, exfiltrating\nsensitive information, and otherwise facilitating malicious attacks. In many cases, these\nplatforms may be required for legitimate corporate activity and, as such, hosting\nmalicious contents or using them to collect sensitive information may allow attackers to\nbypass content filtering mechanisms.\n\nThe use of applications like Discord and Slack may also provide an additional means to\nperform the social engineering required to convince potential victims to open malicious\nattachments. Potential targets who see a link in a chat room they're used to interacting in\non a regular basis may be more likely to open any files that are attached to those rooms or\nclick on links that seem like they're from colleagues. These rooms may also provide a\ndirect communications pathway between adversaries and employees that can be abused\nto facilitate the delivery process. This itself is not a new phenomena — Discord's been\n[used in the past to deliver the Thanatos ransomware. More recently, this mechanism has](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/06/ThanatosDecryptor.html)\nbeen used to deliver a variety of RATs, stealers and other malware including:\n\nLet's look at ways these platforms are now being used throughout the attack lifecycle.\n\n## Malware delivery\n\n\n-----\n\nSome of these apps, including Discord, support file attachments, which makes them a\ntarget for adversaries. And if these apps are being used in a corporate environment, they\nbecome more attractive to adversaries. One of the key challenges associated with malware\ndelivery is making sure that the files, domains, or systems don't get taken down or\nblocked. By leveraging these chat applications that are likely allowed, they are removing\nseveral of those hurdles and greatly increase the likelihood that the attachment reaches\nthe end user. Since these files are uploaded and linked via a URL, there are a lot of\ndifferent ways they can get these links in front of users. These can include more\ntraditional means like URLs in emails, but they can be sent via any messaging or chat\nservice. They could also link to websites or be placed in any number of places. The\nversatility of having a malicious URL that is hosted on a domain unlikely to get blocked is\nobviously attractive to malicious actors.\n\nOn many collaboration platforms such as Discord and Slack, files are transmitted\nbetween users by attaching them in channels. Files are stored within the Content Delivery\nNetwork (CDN) that the platform provider operates, allowing server members to access\nthese files as they appeared when they were originally attached. As an example, this is\nwhat it looks like when a file is uploaded directly to a channel in a Discord server:\n\nWhen files are uploaded and stored within the Discord CDN, they can be accessed using\nthe hardcoded CDN URL by any system, regardless of whether Discord has been installed,\nsimply by browsing to the CDN URL where the content is hosted.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis functionality is not specific to Discord. Other collaboration platforms like Slack have\nsimilar features. Files can be uploaded to Slack, and users can create external links that\nallow the files to be accessed, regardless of whether the recipient even has Slack installed.\n\nOnce an external link has been created, the file is now accessible in much the same way as\nfiles uploaded to Discord.\n\n\n-----\n\nAdversaries have begun taking advantage of this functionality, using it to host their\nmalicious content and then directing victims to the content using the CDN location within\nvarious formats like malspam emails. Over the course of 2020, we observed an increase in\nthe volume of malicious email campaigns containing links to files hosted across these\nCDNs. The graph below shows the volume of emails observed using this technique to\nfacilitate the delivery of various files used to initiate malware infections on victim\nsystems.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe delivery of malicious content in this manner offers two attractive mechanisms that\nattackers can leverage to evade defenses.\n\n1. The content is delivered over HTTPS, meaning that the communications are\n\nencrypted between the endpoint accessing the content and the Discord CDN\ndelivering it.\n2. A natural byproduct of the compression process is obfuscation of the contents of the\n\ncompressed archive.\n\nIt is easy to see why this is an attractive mechanism to adversaries. A variety of different\nfile types have been observed being delivered in this manner. In most cases, these files are\ncompressed archives. Over the past 12 months, we have observed a variety of compression\nalgorithms used, including uncommon formats such as LZH. Below is a list of several of\nthe most common compression types we have observed leveraged across these\ncampaigns.\n\nACE\nGZ\nIMG\nISO\nLZH\nRAR\nTAR\nZIP\n7Z\n\nThe graph below shows a breakdown of how frequently each type of compression was\nused throughout these malspam campaigns.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn most cases, the emails themselves are consistent with what we have grown accustomed\nto seeing from malspam in recent years. Many of the emails purport to be associated with\nvarious financial transactions and contain links to files claiming to be invoices, purchase\norders and other documents of interest to potential victims.\n\nThe message above was one of the stranger examples we found. It was a COVID-themed\nemail purportedly from the World Health Organization (WHO) requesting the target\ndownload a new COVID prevention document. This document was hosted on Discord for\nsome reason. When we followed the link, we found a ZIP file containing a batch, or .bat,\nfile. This batch file then downloaded a word document from Google Drive. When opened,\nthe document triggered a macro that activated on close that went out and downloaded the\nNymaim trojan from a compromised website. This is an incredibly convoluted infection\nprocess that involved multiple services, including Discord and Google Drive, but also\nrequired the victim to open multiple files before the final infection occurred.\n\n\n-----\n\nOne additional thing to note is the wide variety of languages we found when looking at the\nemail messages leveraging Discord, including English, Spanish, French, German and\nPortuguese. One example of the German language campaigns we saw is shown below.\n\nIn this example, the sender offers a 30 percent deposit in the attachment. However, the\nattachment is actually an image made to look like an attachment. The message source\nprovides some additional insight into what the adversary wants to accomplish.\n\nThe bolded text shows that the image is actually a link to an ISO file being hosted on\nDiscord. When the user clicks the image thinking they are opening it locally, it will be\ndownloaded using a web browser. The ISO file, when downloaded, contained a PE32\npayload named \"30 Percento,pdf .exe\", which resulted in the download of the Formbook\nmalware. What is additionally confusing, and potentially lazy on the actor's part, is the\nfilename itself. The email is in German but the attachment uses the Italian word\n\"percento\" and not \"prozent,\" to mean \"percent,\" as would be expected if the file were\nnamed in German. These are just a few of the many examples we found abusing Discord,\nmost of which were the usual invoice, shipping and fax campaigns we observe constantly.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs previously mentioned, the hyperlinks present within these emails typically point to\ncompressed archives hosted within the CDNs of various collaboration platforms like\nDiscord and Slack. These compressed archives contain PE32 files, JavaScript droppers\nand other malicious components that are used to initiate the infection process, retrieve\nadditional payloads, provide remote access capabilities for adversaries, and gather\nsensitive information that can be exfiltrated and subsequently monetized by adversaries.\n\n## Component retrieval\n\nWe also observed adversaries leveraging CDNs for the retrieval of additional malicious\ncontent during and after the initial infection process occurs. In many malware infections\nnowadays, the initial executable or script delivered to victims is the first part of a multistage infection process that often includes the delivery of additional binaries that function\nas modules to carry out various portions of the malware's overall functionality.\n\nWe observed several instances of these CDNs being used to host malicious binaries that\nare pulled down during various phases of the infection process. Various examples of this\nbehavior can be identified across malware repositories. For example, simply searching for\nsamples that reach out to the Discord CDN results in almost 20,000 results in VirusTotal.\n\nThis technique was frequently used across malware distribution campaigns associated\nwith RATs, stealers and other types of malware typically used to retrieve sensitive\ninformation from infected systems. In one example, the first stage payload was\nresponsible for retrieving an ASCII blob from the Discord CDN as shown in the\nscreenshot below.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe data that is retrieved from the Discord CDN is then converted and the final payload is\ninjected into a remote process, in this case created from \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Internet\nExplorer\\ieinstal.exe\".\n\n[The final malware in this instance was Remcos, a commercially available RAT that is](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/08/picking-apart-remcos.html)\nfrequently used by attackers to gain unauthorized access to systems.\n\nAs is common with Remcos infections, the malware communicated with a C2 and\nexfiltrated data via an attacker-controlled DDNS server. The attackers achieved\npersistence through the creation of registry run entries to invoke the malware following\nsystem restarts.\n\n[Another example of this behavior was observed across AsyncRAT campaigns. In this](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.asyncrat)\ninstance, the initial malware downloader took the form of a Microsoft Word document\n[titled \"Word_Nitro_Kodlari\", likely purporting to be associated with Discord Nitro codes](https://discord.com/nitro)\n— access to a premium version of the service — a common theme across the various\nmalware campaigns we analyzed. In this case, the Word document did not contain any\nvisible contents when opened, but contained embedded macros.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Word document contains a macro that executes when the document is opened. This\nmacro is shown below.\n\nThis macro deobfuscates and executes PowerShell that is responsible for retrieving the\nnext stage payload.\n\nIn this case, the payload was AsyncRAT hosted within the Discord CDN. An example of\nthe payload retrieval can be found in the screenshot below:\n\n\n-----\n\nAnother way that we've seen Discord abused is payloads being retrieved from threat\nactors leveraging active exploitation of vulnerabilities. One of the larger botnets that is\nactive today is Mirai, which is constructed primarily of internet-of-things (IoT) devices\nthat overwhelmingly run Linux. This botnet is well known and has been associated with a\nvariety of DDoS and other campaigns. Mirai may be the most well known, but they are\n[not the only botnet or threat operating in this space, including Qbot. This IoT variant of](https://www.alibabacloud.com/blog/the-qakbot-family-extends-introducing-a-new-qbot-variant_594191)\nQbot behaves much like other IoT malicious threats providing capabilities to conduct\nDDoS attacks, download additional payloads, or be used as processing power for things\nlike SSH brute forcing.\n\nWe recently saw an uptick in what appeared to be Mirai activity, but upon further\ninspection, it was actually the IoT-focused QBot variant that affects multiple operating\nsystems. The piece that drew our attention was where the x86 version was being stored.\n\nThese types of commands should look familiar to anyone who has been hunting Mirai\nactivity and is consistent with the other campaigns we've seen before that have been\ntaking advantage of an unauthenticated command execution vulnerability in YARN. What\nmakes this applicable to our current investigation is yet another abuse of Discord to share\n\n\n-----\n\nor distribute malware, in this case the x86 version of Qbot. This shows yet another avenue\nadversaries can take advantage of Discord to distribute malware, even to non-standard\noperating systems like Linux, and more specifically, IoT devices.\n\n## C2 and data exfiltration\n\nDiscord and Slack are also platforms that are being leveraged for the exfiltration of\nsensitive information and the transmission of information from infected systems. In\nmany cases, this activity is conducted via the Discord API which provides a robust\nmechanism that adversaries can take advantage of. Let's take a look at how the Discord\nAPI is being used by attackers and some examples of what sort of malware is using it.\n\n### Webhooks\n\nMalware samples that abuse Discord typically rely on the webhook functionality of the\n[Discord API for C2 communications. Webhooks were designed for sending alerts or](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks)\nautomated messages to a specified Discord server, commonly integrated with other\nservices such as GitHub or DataDog. Webhooks are essentially a URL that a client can\nsend a message to, which in turn posts that message to the specified channel — all without\nusing the actual Discord application.\n\nWebhooks can be used for more than just C2 communications. However, any data can be\nsent to a webhook, allowing for data exfiltration. Using the webhook functionality to\nexfiltrate data has several benefits, the most apparent being ease of use. The other\nimportant advantage to webhooks is the use of the Discord domain for exfiltration over\nHTTPS, allowing the attacker to blend in with other Discord network traffic. The format\nof a webhook would appear fairly innocuous to most users:\n\nThe versatility and accessibility of Discord webhooks makes them a clear choice for some\nthreat actors. With merely a few stolen access tokens, an attacker can employ a truly\neffective malware campaign infrastructure with very little effort. The level of anonymity is\ntoo tempting for some threat actors to pass up.\n\n### Status updates\n\nIn some cases, we observed malware leveraging Discord to send alerts to the attacker\nwhen new systems are infected. In one example, the malware was communicating via\nDiscord to alert the attacker that a new system was available and providing the details\nwhere the system was attempting to communicate to establish a C2 channel. In this case,\n\n\n-----\n\nthe adversaries used the Portmap service for C2 communications. As highlighted in\n[previous publications here and here, Portmap is a common mechanism used by attackers](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2019/08/rat-ratatouille-revrat-orcus.html)\nto obfuscate their C2 infrastructure.\n\n### System enumeration\n\nIn many cases, malware uses the Discord API to send information about the infected\nsystem back to the attacker, similar to what is seen in post-compromise C2 traffic during\nthe bot registration process. One example of this was observed where the attacker was\nexecuting WMI commands on the system, then transmitting the command-line output to\nthe attacker's Discord server, line-by-line, using the Webhook API.\n\nFirst, the malware writes a batch file and an executable called \"DiscordSendWebhook\"\ninto the %TEMP% directory on the infected system. An example of one of the batch files is\nshown below.\n\nNext, the malware executes the batch file, and writes the output of the various commands\ninto text-based log files. It then sends the contents of the log files to the attacker using\n\"DiscordSendWebhook.exe\" which was previously created and executed.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe example below shows one of the API requests made by the infected system. This\nprocess repeats for each line in the WMI command output.\n\nThis demonstrates how abusing the Discord API can provide robust C2 functionality for\nadversaries making use of it in their malware. Additionally, this removes the cost of\nrunning the C2 server infrastructure independently and minimizes the resources required\nto facilitate this activity.\n\n### Pay2Decrypt ransomware\n\nWe also observed ransomware samples leveraging the Discord API for different purposes\nincluding bot registration, data exfiltration and post-infection C2 communications. One\nexample is with a series of campaigns associated with LEAKGAP, a variant of\nPay2Decrypt ransomware that communicates with the attacker using Discord Webhooks.\nDuring the infection process, the system is registered with the attacker's Discord instance\nusing an API request/response similar to the one shown in the screenshot below.\n\nStatus updates regarding the malware's operation on the infected system are also sent\nback to the attacker using the same API.\n\n\n-----\n\nFollowing successful infection, the data stored on the system is no longer available to the\nvictim and the following ransom note is displayed.\n\nNew samples that are leveraging the Discord API for C2 communications are being\nobserved regularly, with some RATs being designed specifically to facilitate remote access\nto infected systems using this same mechanism. This trend will likely continue as more\nattackers leverage these channels to blend in with legitimate network traffic and evade\ndetection in corporate environments.\n\n### Token stealing\n\nOne of the most critical tasks while operating a malware campaign is to stay anonymous.\nOne of the most effective ways to remain anonymous while abusing Discord is to hijack\nanother user's account.\n\nA Discord access token is a unique alphanumeric string that is generated for each user\nand is essentially the \"key\" to that user's account. If another party were to have access to\nthis token it would allow them to have full control over that account.\n\nAt the time of writing, Discord does not implement client verification to prevent\nimpersonation by way of a stolen access token. This has led to a large amount of Discord\ntoken stealers being implemented and distributed on GitHub and other forums. In many\ncases, the token stealers pose as useful utilities related to online gaming, as Discord is one\nof the most prevalent chat and collaboration platforms in use in the gaming community\n\n\n-----\n\nBelow is a non-exhaustive list of some token stealers hosted on GitHub at the time of this\nwriting:\nThese token stealers are written in several different languages including C# and Python.\nThey can be implemented in script form or a compiled binary, depending on the\nattacker's choice of language. Creating these stealers is relatively easy as the process for\nstealing the access token is very simple. All that is required for stealing a token is locating\nit in the appropriate directory, and sending it back to the attacker via a webhook, as\ndiscussed in the \"Webhooks\" section above. Additionally, well-known information\n[stealers like Masslogger have been observed implementing Discord token-stealing.](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2021/02/masslogger-cred-exfil.html)\n\nOnce a token has been stolen, the attacker now has the ability to impersonate its owner.\nTypically, these compromised accounts are used in a malware campaign to add a level of\nanonymity to the operation. Common abuses of stolen accounts include uploading\npayloads to the Discord CDN, social engineering of other users and generating webhooks.\n\n**_Growtopia-themed stealer in action._**\n\n## Conclusion\n\nMalicious threat actors are always trying to find new and effective ways to get malware\nexecuting on systems and one of the biggest challenges is distribution. As chat apps like\nDiscord, Slack and many others rise in popularity, organizations need to assess how these\napplications can be abused by adversaries and how many of them should be allowed to\noperate inside your enterprise. As we've shown repeatedly in this blog, these types of\napplications require content delivery networks (CDNs) to ensure their content is available\nto people everywhere and malicious actors have noticed. It's likely the abuse of these chat\napps will only increase in the near and long term. As more applications become available\nand some rise and fall in popularity, new avenues will continually be opened for\nadversaries.\n\nAs defenders, we need to decide what chat applications are allowed and why, while clearly\ncommunicating to management the risk associated with each. If you don't use a chat app\ninternally for business purposes, it may be worth considering blocking some of the\n\n\n-----\n\ndomains that can be abused for content delivery or putting other mitigations in place to\nhelp reduce the risk. We've continually seen adversaries evolve from including\nattachments directly in email, to hosting it on their own infrastructure, to using filing\nsharing services, and now abusing chat applications and that is just from email based\nthreats. The name of the game is getting malware onto end systems and as we've seen\nrepeatedly the bad guys will do whatever is necessary to achieve these goals.\n\n## Coverage\n\nWays our customers can detect and block this threat are listed below.\n\n[Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) is](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/advanced-malware-protection)\nideally suited to prevent the execution of\nthe malware detailed in this post.
