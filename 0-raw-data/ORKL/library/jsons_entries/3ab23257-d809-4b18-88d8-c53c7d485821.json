During this research we encountered a number of binary files that we have attributed to the developer(s) of ‘Grace’ (i.e. FlawedGrace).\nThese included a remote administration tool (RAT) used exclusively by TA505. The identified binary files are capable of communicating with\neach other through a peer-to-peer (P2P) network via UDP. While there does not appear to be a direct interaction between the identified\nsamples and a host infected by ‘Grace’, we believe with medium to high confidence that there is a connection to the developer(s) of ‘Grace’\nand the identified binaries.\n\nIn summary, we found the following:\n\nP2P binary files, which are downloaded along with other Necurs components (signed drivers, block lists)\nP2P binary files, which transfer certain information (records) between nodes\nBased on the network IDs of the identified samples, there seem to be at least three different networks running\nThe programming style and dropped file formats match the development standards of ‘Grace’\n\n## History of TA505’s Shift to Ransomware Operations\n\n 2014: Emergence as a group\n\nThe threat actor, often referred to as TA505 publicly, has been distinguished as an independent threat actor by NCC Group since 2014.\nInternally we used the name “Dridex RAT group”. Initially it was a group that integrated quite closely with EvilCorp, utilising their Dridex banking\nmalware platform to execute relatively advanced attacks, using often custom made tools for a single purpose and repurposing commonly\navailable tools such as ‘Ammyy Admin’ and ‘RMS’/’RUT’ to complement their arsenal. The attacks performed mostly consisted of\ncompromising organisations and social engineering victims to execute high value bank transfers to corporate mule accounts. These operations\nincluded social engineering correctly implemented two-factor authentication with dual authorization by both the creator of a transaction and the\nauthorizee.\n\n## 2017: Evolution\n\nLate 2017, EvilCorp and TA505 (Dridex RAT Group) split as a partnership. Our hypothesis is that EvilCorp had started to use the Bitpaymer\nransomware to extort organisations rather than doing banking fraud. This built on the fact they had already been using the Locky ransomware\npreviously and was attracting unwanted attention EvilCorp’s ability to execute enterprise ransomware across large-scale businesses was first\n\n\n-----\n\nde o st ated ay 0 e capab ty a d success at pu g o suc attac s ste ed o t e u e ous yea s o e pe e ce\ncompromising corporate networks for banking fraud activity, specifically moving laterally to separate hosts controlled by employees who had\nthe required access and control of corporate bank accounts. The same techniques in relation to lateral movement and tools (such as Empire,\nArmitage, Cobalt Strike and Metasploit) enabled EvilCorp to become highly effective in targeted ransomware attacks.\n\nHowever in 2017 TA505 went on their own path and specifically in 2018 executed a large number of attacks using the tool called ‘Grace’, also\nknown publicly as ‘FlawedGrace’ and ‘GraceWire’. The victims were mostly financial institutions and a large number of the victims were located\nin Africa, South Asia, and South East Asia with confirmed fraudulent wire transactions and card data theft originating from victims of TA505.\nThe tool ‘Grace’ had some interesting features, and showed some indications that it was originally designed as banking malware which had\nlatterly been repurposed. However, the tool was developed and was used in hundreds of victims worldwide, while remaining relatively unknown\nto the wider public in its first years of use.\n\n## 2019: Clop and wider tooling\n\nIn early 2019, TA505 started to utilise the Clop ransomware, alongside other tools such as ‘SDBBot’ and ‘ServHelper’, while continuing to use\n‘Grace’ up to and including 2021. Today it appears that the group has realised the potential of ransomware operations as a viable business\nmodel and the relative ease with which they can extort large sums of money from victims.\n\nThe remainder of this post dives deeper into a tool discovered by NCC Group that we believe is related to TA505 and the developer of ‘Grace’.\nWe assess that the identified tool is part of a bigger network, possibly related with Grace infections.\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\nThe technical analysis we provide below focuses on three components of the execution chain:\n\n1. A downloader – Runs as a service (each identified variant has a different name) and downloads the rest of the components along with a\n\ntarget processes/services list that the driver uses while filtering information. Necurs have used similar downloaders in the past.\n2. A signed driver (both x86 and x64 available) – Filters processes/services in order to avoid detection and/or prevent removal. In addition,\n\nit injects the payload into a new process.\n3. Node tool – Communicates with other nodes in order to transfer victim’s data.\n\nIt should be noted that for all above components, different variations were identified. However, the core functionality and purposes remain the\nsame.\n\nUpon execution, the downloader generates a GUID (used as a bot ID) and stores it in the `ProgramData folder under the filename`\n```\nregid.1991-06.com.microsoft.dat . Any downloaded file is stored temporarily in this directory. In addition, the downloader reads the\n\n```\nversion of `crypt32.dll in order to determine the version of the operating system.`\n\nNext, it contacts the command and control server and downloads the following files:\n\nt.dat – Expected to contain the string ‘kwREgu73245Nwg7842h’\np3.dat – P2P Binary. Saved as ‘payload.dll’\nd1c.dat – x86 (signed) Driver\nd2c.dat – x64 (signed) Driver\nbn.dat – List of processes for the driver to filter. Stored as ‘blacknames.txt’\nbs.dat – List of services’ name for the driver to filter. Stored as ‘blacksigns.txt’\nbv.dat – List of files’ version names for the driver to filter. Stored as ‘blackvers.txt’.\nr.dat – List of registry keys for the driver to filter. Stored as ‘registry.txt’\n\nThe network communication of the downloader is simple. Firstly, it sends a GET request to the command and control server, downloads and\nsaves on disk the appropriate component. Then, it reads the component from disk and decrypts it (using the RC4 algorithm) with the\nhardcoded key ‘ABCDF343fderfds21’. After decrypting it, the downloader deletes the file.\n\nDepending on the component type, the downloader stores each of them differently. Any configurations (e.g. list of processes to filter) are stored\nin registry under the key `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\CLSID with the value name being the thread ID of the downloader. The`\ndata are stored in plaintext with a unique ID value at the start (e.g. 0x20 for the processes list), which is used later by the driver as a\ncommunication method.\n\nIn addition, in one variant, we detected a reporting mechanism to the command and control server for each step taken. This involves sending a\nGET request, which includes the generated bot ID along with a status code. The below table summarises each identified request (Table 1).\n\n**Request** **Description**\n\n/c/p1/dnsc.php?n=%s&in=%s First parameter is the bot ID and the second is the formatted string\n(“Version_is_%d.%d_(%d)_%d__ARCH_%d”), which contains operating system info\n\n\n/c/p1/dnsc.php?\nn=%s&sz=DS_%d\n\n\nFirst parameter is the bot ID and the second is the downloaded driver’s size\n\n\n-----\n\n/c/p1/dnsc.php?\nn=%s&er=ERR_%d\n\n\nFirst parameter is the bot ID and the second is the error code\n\n\n/c/p1/dnsc.php?n=%s&c1=1 The first parameter is the bot ID. Notifies the server that the driver was installed successfully\n\n\n/c/p1/dnsc.php?\nn=%s&c1=1&er=REB_ERR_%d\n\n/c/p1/dnsc.php?\nn=%s&sz=ErrList_%d_%\n\n/c/p1/dnsc.php?\nn=%s&er=PING_ERR_%d\n\n/c/p1/dnsc.php?\nn=%s&c1=1&c2=1\n\n/c/p1/dnsc.php?\nn=%s&c1=1&c2=1&c3=1\n\nTable 1 – Reporting to C2 requests\n\n## Driver Analysis\n\n\nFirst parameter is the bot ID and the second is the error code obtained while attempting to shut down the\nhost after finding Windows Defender running\n\nFirst parameter is the bot ID, second parameter is the resulted error code while retrieving the blocklist\nprocesses. The third parameter is set to 1. The same command is also issued after downloading the\nblacklisted services’ names and versions. The only difference is on the third parameter, which is\nincreased to ‘2’ for blacklisted services, ‘3’ for versions and ‘4’ for blacklisted registry keys\n\nFirst parameter is the bot ID and the second parameter is the error code obtained during the driver\ndownload process\n\nFirst parameter is the bot ID. Informs the server that the bot is about to start the downloading process.\n\nFirst parameter is the bot ID. Notified the server that the payload (node tool) was downloaded and stored\nsuccessfully\n\n\nThe downloaded driver is the same one that Necurs uses. It has been analysed publically already [1] but in summary, it does the following.\n\nIn the first stage, the driver decrypts shellcode, copies it to a new allocated pool and then executes the payload. Next, the shellcode decrypts\nand runs (in memory) another driver (stored encrypted in the original file). The decryption algorithm remains the same in both cases:\n```\nxor_key = extracted_xor_key\nbits = 15\nresult = b''\nfor i in range(0,payload_size,4):\n     data = encrypted[i:i+4]\n     value = int.from_bytes (data, 'little' )^ xor_key\n     result += ( _rol(value, bits, 32) ^ xor_key).to_bytes(4,'little')\n\n```\nEventually, the decrypted driver injects the payload (the P2P binary) into a new process (‘wmiprvse.exe’) and proceeds with the filtering of\ndata.\n\nA notable piece of code of the driver is the strings’ decryption routine, which is also present in recent GraceRAT samples, including the same\nXOR key\n(1220A51676E779BD877CBECAC4B9B8696D1A93F32B743A3E6790E40D745693DE58B1DD17F65988BEFE1D6C62D5416B25BB78EF0622B\n\n## Payload Attribution and Analysis\n\nThe identified sample is written in C++ and interacts with other nodes in the network using UDP. We believe that the downloaded binary file is\nrelated with TA505 for (at least) the following reasons:\n\n1. Same serialisation library\n2. Same programming style with ‘Grace’ samples\n3. Similar naming convention in the configuration’s keys with ‘Grace’ samples\n4. Same output files (dsx), which we have seen in previous TA505 compromises. DSX files have been used by ‘Grace’ operators to store\n\ninformation related with compromised machines.\n\n## Initialisation Phase\n\nIn the initialisation phase, the sample ensures that the configurations have been loaded and the appropriate folders are created.\n\nAll identified samples store their configurations in a resource with name `XC .`\n\n**_ANALYST NOTE: Due to limit visibility of other nodes, we were not able to identify the purpose of each key of the configurations._**\n\nThe first configuration stores the following settings:\n\ncx – Parent name\nnid – Node ID. This is used as a network identification method during network communication. If the incoming network packet does not\nhave the same ID then the packet is treated as a packet from a different network and is ignored.\ndgx – Unknown\nexe – Binary mode flag (DLL/EXE)\n\n\n-----\n\ney S ey to use o e y g a eco d\nport – UDP port to listen\nva – Parent name. It includes the node IPs to contact.\n\nThe second configuration contains the following settings (or metadata as the developer names them):\n\nmeta – Parent name\napp – Unknown. Probably specifies the variant type of the server. The following seem to be supported:\n\ntarget (this is the current set value)\ngate\ndrop\ncontrol\nmod – Specifies if current binary is the core module.\nbld – Unknown\napi – Unknown\nllr – Unknown\nllt- Unknown\n\nNext, the sample creates a set of folders and files in a directory named ‘target’. These folders are:\n\nnode (folder) – Stores records of other nodes\ntrash (folder) – Move files for deletion\nunits (folder) – Unknown. Appears to contain PE files, which the core module loads.\nsessions (folder) – Active nodes’ sessions\nunits.dsx (file) – List of ‘units’ to load\nprobes.dsx (file) – Stores the connected nodes IPs along with other metadata (e.g. connection timestamp, port number)\nnet.dsx (file) – Node peer name\nreports.dsx (file) – Used in recent versions only. Unknown purpose.\n\n## Network communication\n\nAfter the initialisation phase has been completed, the sample starts sending UDP requests to a list of IPs in order to register itself into the\nnetwork and then exchange information.\n\nEvery network packet has a header, which has the below structure:\n```\nstruct Node_Network_Packet_Header\n{\n BYTE XOR_Key;\n BYTE Version; // set to 0x37 ('7')\n BYTE Encrypted_node_ID[16]; // XORed with XOR_Key above\n BYTE Peer_Name[16]; // Xored with XOR_Key above. Connected peer name\n BYTE Command_ID; //Internally called frame type\n DWORD Watermark; //XORed with XOR_Key above\n DWORD Crc32_Data; //CRC32 of above data\n};\n\n```\nWhen the sample requires adding additional information in a network packet, it uses the below structure:\n```\nstruct Node_Network_Packet_Payload\n{\n DWORD Size;\n DWORD CRC32_Data;\n BYTE Data[Size]; // Xored with same key used in the header packet (XOR_Key)\n};\n\n```\nAs expected, each network command (Table 2) adds a different set of information in the ‘Data’ field of the above structure but most of the\ncommands follow a similar format. For example, an ‘invitation’ request (Command ID 1) has the structure:\n```\nstruct Node_Network_Invitation_Packet \n{\n BYTE CMD_ID;\n DWORD Session_Label;\n BYTE Invitation_ID[16];\n BYTE Node_Peer_Name[16];\n WORD Node_Binded_Port;\n};\n\n```\nThe sample supports a limited set of commands, which have as a primary role to exchange ‘records’ between each other.\n\n**Command ID** **Description**\n\n1 Requests to register in the other nodes (‘invitation’ request)\n\n\n-----\n\n2 Adds node IP to the probes list\n\n3 Sends a ping request. It includes number of active connections and records\n\n4 Sends number of active connections and records in the node\n\n5 Adds a new node IP:Port that the remote node will check\n\n6 Sends a record ID along with the number of data blocks\n\n7 Requests metadata of a record\n\n8 Sends metadata of a record\n\n9 Requests the data of a record\n\n10 Receives data of a record and store them on disk\n\nTable 2 – Set of command IDs\n**_ANALYST NOTE: When information, such as record IDs or number of active connections/records, is sent, the binary adds the length of the_**\n_data followed by the actual data. For example, in case of sending number of active connections and records:_\n\n_01 05 01 02 01 02_\n\n_The above is translated as:_\n\n_2 active connections from a total of 5 with 2 records._\n\nMoreover, when a node receives a request, it sends an echo reply (includes the same packet header) to acknowledge that the request was\nread. In general, the following types are supported:\n\nRequest type of 0x10 for echo request.\nRequest type of 0x07 when sending data, which fit in one packet.\nRequest type of 0xD when sending data in multiple packets (size of payload over 1419 bytes).\nRequest type 0x21. It exists in the binary but not supported during the network communications.\n\n## Record files\n\nAs mentioned already, a record has its own sub-folder under the ‘node’ folder with each sub-folder containing the below files:\n\nm – Metadata of record file\nl – Unknown purpose\np – Payload data\n\nThe metadata file contains a set of information for the record such as the node peer name and the node network ID. Among this information,\nthe keys ‘tag’ and ‘pwd’ appear to be very important too. The ‘tag’ key represents a command (different from table 2 set) that the node will\nexecute once it receives the record. Currently, the binary only supports the command ‘updates’. The payload file (p) keeps the updated content\nencrypted with the value of key ‘pwd’ being the AES key.\n\nEven though we have not been able yet to capture any network traffic for the above command, we believe that it is used to update the current\nrunning core module.\n\n## IoCs\n\n Nodes’ IPs\n\n45.142.213[.]139:555\n\n195.123.246[.]14:555\n\n45.129.137[.]237:33964\n\n78.128.112[.]139:33964\n\n145.239.85[.]6:3333\n\n## Binaries\n\n**SHA-1** **Description**\n\n\n-----\n\nA21D19EB9A90C6B579BCE8017769F6F58F9DADB1 P2P Binary\n\n2F60DE5091AB3A0CE5C8F1A27526EFBA2AD9A5A7 P2P Binary\n\n2D694840C0159387482DC9D7E59217CF1E365027 P2P Binary\n\n02FFD81484BB92B5689A39ABD2A34D833D655266 x86 Driver\n\nB4A9ABCAAADD80F0584C79939E79F07CBDD49657 x64 Driver\n\n00B5EBE5E747A842DEC9B3F14F4751452628F1FE X64 Driver\n\n22F8704B74CE493C01E61EF31A9E177185852437 Downloader\n\nD1B36C9631BCB391BC97A507A92BCE90F687440A Downloader\n\nTable 3 – Binaries hashes\n\n## References\n\n[1. https://pro-cdo-web-resources.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/elevenpaths/uploads/2020/6/elevenpaths-informe-aptualizator-2-en.pdf](https://pro-cdo-web-resources.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/elevenpaths/uploads/2020/6/elevenpaths-informe-aptualizator-2-en.pdf)\n\n\n-----",
