The Coldriver Group, also known as Callisto and SEABORGIUM, is a Russia-based\nespionage threat actor group known to attack government organizations, think tanks, and journalists in\nEurope and the Caucasus regions through spearphishing and hack-and-leak campaigns.\n\nNisos investigated PII selectors associated with domains used in recent Coldriver Group activity in order\nto identify further selectors and identify links between the Russian Government and the Coldriver\nGroup. Investigators traced a selector back to an individual named Andrey Korinets.\n\nAndrey Stanislavovich Korinets (Коринец Андрей Станиславович), through a company email\naddress, it@ugs[.]center, is linked to LLC UHTAGAZSERVICE (ООО УХТАГАЗСЕРВИС), a Russian\ncompany that contracts with Russian governmental entities.\n\nKorinets is currently employed by Trustlink, an SEO exchange that has been operating in the internet\nmarketing and SEO industry since 2008, while still residing in Syktyvkar. The email address used by his\nVK account was used as the contact email address for an ezine published by the hacker underground in\nSyktyvkar. He is currently employed by Trustlink[.]ru.1\n\nThis organization is an “exchange of trusted links and unique articles,” used for sharing links between\nweb site owners and advertisers and is built on top of the SEOPult[.]pro marketing platform. It is\npossible that the Coldriver group is using Trustlink infrastructure or the SEOPult platform to build out\ntheir phishing infrastructure. [23]\n\nTwo email addresses, cp.regname@googlemail[.]com and vladimirdj90@gmail[.]com, attributed to\nKorinets, provided reviews for Syktyvkar-based Lavina Private Security Company (Лавина Частное\nОхранное Предприятие).\n\nWhile researchers identified no indication of Korinets’ employment with Lavina, the company hires\nformer Russian military and intelligence personnel to address clients’ physical and technical security as\nwell as security alarm response.\n\nResearchers also identified two individuals, Andrey Georgievich Yushkov (Юшков Андрей\n## Георгиевич) and Alexey Valerievich Doguzhiev (Догужиев Алексей Валерьевич) through email\naddresses andrey_usk@mail[.]ru and vladimirdj90@gmail[.]com respectively that appear to be shared\nwith Andrey Korinets.\n\nThe email it@ugs[.]center is linked to ООО УХТАГАЗСЕРВИС (LLC UHTAGAZSERVICE), a Komi,\nUkhta-based company that conducts business spanning from construction to natural resources\n\n1 [https://museum.netstalking[.]ru/xaknotdie/index-27.htm](https://museum.netstalking/)\n\n2\nhttps://trustlink[.]ru\n\n3\nhttps://www.facebook[.]com/Trustlinkru\n\n\n-----\n\ninfrastructure, according to Russian corporate data and the company website.4 5 LLC UHTAGAZSERVICE,\n\nINN 1102073810, has had seven government contracts totaling more than 100 million Rubles, one of\nwhich was with the government administration SE “Sosnogorsk”, according to the same Russian\ncorporate record. Efforts to identify a connection between Andrey and LLC UHTAGAZSERVICE other6\n\nthan the it@ugs[.]center email provided no results.\n\nEfforts to definitively determine whether the actors are a network of individuals or an individual\nprovided inconclusive results.\n\n4\nhttps://www.rusprofile[.]ru/okved/7041149#other\n\n5\nhttps://ugs[.]center/?yandex-source=desktop-maps#preimuschestva\n\n6\nhttps://www.rusprofile[.]ru/gz/7041149\n\n\n-----\n\n# Andrey Stanislavovich Korinets\n\nResearchers identified a possible legal name for Andrey Korinets and potential name spelling variants;\nКоринец Андрей Станиславович (Korinets Andrey Stanislavovich) and Корипец Андрей\nСтаниславович (Koripets Andrey Stanislavovich). Based on shared selector data, we judge Korinets\nand Koripets are the same person.\n\nResearchers identified the following selectors via leak data:\n\n  - DOB: 18-May-1987, 18-Aug-1987\n\n  - Phone: 79087150442, tagged as “Andrey K” in Russian contact information\n\n  - Email: szine.info@gmail[.]com; nepkomi@gmail[.]com; jorgen2004@bk[.]ru;\nzeg888@gmail[.]com; it@ugs[.]center; cp.regname@googlemail[.]com;\nvladimirdj90@gmail.com\n\n  - VK: https://vk[.]com/win32\n\nEmail address szine.info@gmail[.]com is directly linked to the aforementioned POI’s VK account,\naccording to leaked data.
