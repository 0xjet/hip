Alien, a fork of Cerberus, continues to evade\nGoogle’s malware detection and is targeting a broad spectrum of both financial and nonfinancial apps. So far, Alien has been connected with 87 new brands previously not targeted\nby Cerberus.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Cerberus versus Alien Brands Targeted_\n\nPrior to its decline, Cerberus operators dominated the mobile malware landscape both in\nfunctionality and attacks. Cerberus was a malware-as-a-service (MaaS) and targeted 139\nknown brands during its life.\n\nSince January 2020, Alien has been observed targeting 226 different brands. Alien’s high\nvolume of targets may be attributed to its adoption by a growing number of threat actors\neager to take advantage of desirable enhancements that increase the success of executing\nfraud. It also uses a MaaS approach with built-in features that can achieve a wide range of\nobjectives.\n\nSpecifically, Alien has capabilities not previously seen with Cerberus, such as the ability to\ninstall and navigate Android’s TeamViewer. Using TeamViewer gives the operator full remote\ncontrol access to the infected device, as well as the ability to change device settings, interact\nwith applications, and monitor user behavior.\n\nAlien authors have also incorporated a notification sniffer that allows access to all new\nupdates on infected devices. This includes the ability to steal tokens from Google’s\nAuthenticator application, enabling actors to bypass two-factor authentication security\nmeasures.\n\nAlien does possess the features originally associated with Cerberus, including keylogging,\nSMS harvesting, and dynamic overlays.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Financial Institutions versus Non-Financials Targeted by Alien_\n\nNotably, we continue to observe Alien being used to target an increasing number of nonfinancial institutions compared to other mobile and desktop malware. This approach boosts\nthe effectiveness of Alien distribution by taking advantage of how individuals may be less\nvigilant when interacting with non-financial applications not traditionally associated with\nfraud.\n\nWhile there is inherent value in capturing email credentials, Alien operators are using custom\noverlays with dynamic targeting to increasingly capture financial credentials from nonfinancial apps. Operators are able to pick their desired targets from a list of installed apps\nsent by the infected device, then supplant the actual application on the screen with an\noverlay. This overlay is customized HTML code that resembles the target app and elicits\npayment or identity verification from the victim.\n\nBelow is an example of Alien operators impersonating a popular video streaming service to\nsteal both email and credit card information.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Fake Customer Login Page_\n\n_Fake Credit Card Entry_\n\nAlien’s enhanced features and broader targeting capabilities appear to be making it the\nmobile MaaS of choice for threat actors. As long as it continues to evade Android’s security\ncontrols, we expect adoption of Alien to continue increasing.\n\n[PhishLabs can help organizations protect against mobile malware threats such as Alien.](https://www.phishlabs.com/banking-trojans/)\n[Learn more about Digital Risk Protection Solutions.](https://www.phishlabs.com/drp-digital-risk-protection/)\n\n\n-----\n\nAdditional Resources:\n\n## Vishing Attacks Are at an All-Time High, Report Finds\n\nVishing attacks have increased almost 550 percent over the last twelve months, according\nto Agari and PhishLabs’ Quarterly Threat Trends & Intelligence Report.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Qbot Payloads Dominate Q1\n\nQbot payloads targeting enterprises contributed to almost three quarters of all email-based\nmalware since the beginning of 2022.\n\n## What is the HelpSystems Value Proposition for Cybersecurity?\n\n\n-----\n\nIn this guest blog, Dr Ed Amoroso, CEO, Tag Cyber, provides a high-level overview of the\nHelpSystems cybersecurity portfolio value proposition based on a mapping of its\ncomponent solution offerings to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) phases.\n\n\n-----",
