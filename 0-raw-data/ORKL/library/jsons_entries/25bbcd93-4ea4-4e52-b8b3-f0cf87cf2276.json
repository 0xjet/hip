The report will also be of interest to companies with an exposed third-party_\n_supply chain._\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nA sustained cyberespionage campaign targeting at least three companies in the United\nStates and Europe was uncovered by Recorded Future and Rapid7 between November\n2017 and September 2018. Based on the technical data uncovered, and in light of\nrecent disclosures by the U.S. Department of Justice on the ongoing activities of\nChinese state-sponsored threat actors, we assess with high confidence that these\nincidents were conducted by APT10 (also known as Stone Panda, menuPass, CVNX) in\nan effort to gain access to networks and steal valuable intellectual property or gain\ncommercial advantage.\n\nThe targeted companies included:\n\nIT and business cloud services managed service provider (MSP) and Recorded\nFuture client and supplier, Visma, a billion-dollar Norwegian company with at\nleast 850,000 customers globally\nAn international apparel company\nA U.S. law firm with strong experience in intellectual property law with clients in\nthe pharmaceutical, technology, electronics, biomedical, and automotive sectors,\namong others\n\nIn all three incidents, the attackers gained access to networks through deployments of\nCitrix and LogMeIn remote-access software using stolen valid user credentials. The\nattackers then enumerated access and conducted privilege escalation on the victim\nnetworks, utilizing DLL sideloading techniques documented in a US-CERT alert on\nAPT10 to deliver malware. During the Visma intrusion, APT10 deployed their Trochilus\nmalware with command and control (C2) communications encrypted using both RC4\nand Salsa20 streaming ciphers rather than the typically observed RC4 variant. On the\ntwo other victim networks, the attackers deployed a unique version of the UPPERCUT\n(ANEL) backdoor, known to have only been used by APT10.\n\nAPT10 actors then compressed proprietary data from Visma using WinRAR (deployed\nby the attackers) and exfiltrated to a Dropbox account using the cURL for Windows\ncommand-line tool. The same Dropbox account was also accessed in a similar fashion\nby the attackers during the apparel company intrusion. Dropbox was also used to\nstore exfiltrated documents from the third victim, a U.S. law firm, with the files again\nexfiltrated using identical TTPs and uploaded using cURL for Windows.\n\nWe believe APT10 is the most significant Chinese state-sponsored cyber threat to\nglobal corporations known to date. On top of the breadth, volume, and targets of\n[attacks that APT10 has conducted since at least 2016, we now know that these](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-chinese-hackers-associated-ministry-state-security-charged-global-computer-intrusion)\noperations are being run by the Chinese intelligence agency, the Ministry of State\nSecurity (MSS)\n\n\n-----\n\nTechnology Development Co Ltd (天津华盈海泰科技发展有限公司), and under the direct\nsupervision of their regional bureau in Tianjin, the MSS has conducted an\n[unprecedented campaign, dubbed “Operation Cloud Hopper,” against managed IT](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-cyber-hpe-ibm-exclusive/exclusive-china-hacked-hpe-ibm-and-then-attacked-clients-sources-idUSKCN1OJ2OY)\nservice providers (MSPs) designed to steal intellectual property and enable secondary\nattacks against their clients. Access to the networks of these third-party service\nproviders grants the MSS the ability to potentially access the networks of hundreds, if\nnot thousands, of corporations around the world. We assess that APT10 likely\ncompromised Visma with the primary goal of enabling secondary intrusions onto their\nclient networks, and not of stealing Visma intellectual property.\n\nIn this same time frame, APT10 also targeted a U.S. law firm and an international\napparel company, likely to gather information for commercial advantage. In all three\nincidents, APT10 actors used previously acquired legitimate credentials, possibly\ngained via a third-party supply chain compromise in order to gain initial access to the\nlaw firm and the apparel company.\n\nRecorded Future timeline of APT10 activity between August 2018 and January 2019.\n\n## Key Judgments\n\nWe have identified a new variant of Trochilus malware, with its C2\ncommunications encrypted using a combination of RC4 and Salsa20 stream\nciphers.\nAn UPPERCUT backdoor was identified in the targeting of an international\napparel company and U.S. law firm. The backdoor was deployed using the\nNotepad++ updater and sideloading malicious DLL, as noted in APT10’s targeting\nof Japanese corporations in July 2018.\nIn addition to using Trochilus and UPPERCUT APT10 utilized a series of\n\n\n-----\n\nSome of these TTPs include:\n\nTransferring tools from the C2 to the host using BITSAdmin-scheduled\ntasks into C:\\ProgramData\\temp\nUse of DLL sideloading by executing a legitimate binary to load a renamed\nmalicious DLL that decrypts, decompresses, and injects a Trochilus payload\ninto memory\nUse of legitimate credentials, possibly acquired through previous MSP\ncompromises, to log in to accessible Citrix Remote Desktop clients in\ntargeted organizations\n\n\n-----\n\n## Background\n\nAPT10 is a threat actor that has been active since at least 2009. It has historically\ntargeted healthcare, defense, aerospace, government, heavy industry and mining, and\nMSPs and IT services, as well as other sectors, for probable intellectual property theft.\n\nIn early 2017, APT10 began conducting attacks against global managed IT service\nproviders (MSPs) that granted them unprecedented access to MSPs and their\ncustomers’ networks. During this operation (dubbed “‘Cloud Hopper” because of the\ngroup’s use of popular western cloud-based services), APT10 utilized both new\nmalware (Quasar RAT, Trochilus, RedLeaves, ChChes) as well as some familiar old tools\n(Poison Ivy, PlugX).\n\nMost recently, on December 20, 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice charged two\nhackers associated with the Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS) with global\ncomputer intrusion campaigns targeting intellectual property. This indictment\nattributed the intrusions to APT10, a group that had been conducting the malicious\nactivities for over a decade on behalf of the MSS, China’s civilian human intelligence\nagency. Some of the material included within the indictment corroborated information\n[detailed in the Intrusion Truth blog that provided strong evidence attributing APT10 to](https://intrusiontruth.wordpress.com/2018/08/15/apt10-was-managed-by-the-tianjin-bureau-of-the-chinese-ministry-of-state-security/)\nthe Tianjin State Security Bureau, a provincial bureau of the Ministry of State Security.\nIn the blog, Intrusion Truth identified APT10 as having utilized several Tianjin-based\ncompanies, including Huaying Haitai Science and Technology Development Co. Ltd.\nand Laoying Baichen Instruments Equipment Co. Ltd.\n\n\n-----\n\n[U.S. Department of Justice indictment of APT10 threat actors.

Our research from 2017 concluded that Guangdong ITSEC](https://www.recordedfuture.com/chinese-mss-behind-apt3/)\n(and therefore the MSS) directed the activities of a company named Boyusec, which\nwas identified as a shell company for APT3.\n\nSuspected Tianjin State Security Bureau headquarters. (Source: [IntrusionTruth)](https://intrusiontruth.wordpress.com/2018/08/15/apt10-was-managed-by-the-tianjin-bureau-of-the-chinese-ministry-of-state-security/)\n\n[The December APT10 indictment noted that the group’s malicious activities breached](https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/cyber/apt-10-group/)\nat least 45 companies and managed service providers in 12 countries, including Brazil,\n\n\n-----\n\n### About Visma\n\nVisma offers software and services that simplify and digitize core business processes\nin the private and public sector. The Visma group operates across the entire Nordic\nregion along with Benelux, Central, and Eastern Europe. With 8,500 employees, more\n[than 850,000 customers, and a net revenue of NOK 8,537 million (approximately $1](https://www.visma.com/about-visma/organisation/the-visma-group/)\nbillion USD) in 2017, Visma is one of Europe’s leading software companies.\n\n### Intrusion Overview\n\nRecorded Future’s Insikt Group has actively tracked APT10 for several years, focusing\nspecifically on the group’s targeting of MSPs and global internet infrastructure\nproviders since the Operation Cloud Hopper report in 2017. We were particularly\ninterested in identifying whether any customers of the targeted MSPs were\nsubsequently compromised by APT10, given their potential access through\ncompromised MSP networks.\n\nIn September 2018, one of our clients (and a supplier as well), Visma, reached out to us\nfor assistance in investigating an incident uncovered on their network following a\nbreach notification by Rapid7. Visma provided us with malware samples and network\nlogs from the event. Analysis of the data revealed that Visma’s Citrix infrastructure had\nbeen probed and subsequently accessed using stolen credentials as early as August\n17, 2018. This was followed by an initial exploitation, network enumeration, and\nmalicious tool deployment on various Visma endpoints within two weeks of initial\naccess. The theft of enterprise login credentials was conducted within two and a half\nweeks of initial access.\n\nOn August 30, 2018, APT10 deployed their first modified version of Trochilus that had\nits C2 communications encrypted using Salsa20 and RC4 ciphers instead of the more\ncommon RC4-encrypted Trochilus variant seen in the wild. This sample, similar to other\nTrochilus samples, was deployed using a DLL sideloading method utilizing three files,\nuploaded to the same folder on the victim machine as identified in US-CERT advisory\nTA17-117A (last revised on December 20, 2018). This method involves the use of a\nlegitimate binary (File 1) used to load a malicious DLL (File 2). The malicious DLL is\nrenamed to match the name of an expected DLL to be loaded by the executable. The\nmalicious DLL then decrypts and decompresses shellcode contained within a third file\nplaced by the attackers in the same temporary folder. The configuration file then loads\nthe Trochilus payload into memory by injecting it into a valid system process. This\n[method of malicious payload installation is a well-documented TTP of APT10.](https://www.pwc.co.uk/cyber-security/pdf/cloud-hopper-annex-b-final.pdf)\n\nThe attackers used Mimikatz (pd.exe) to enable credential theft and made use of\nscheduled tasks via the Microsoft BITSAdmin utility to transfer files from their C2 to\nthe Visma network. The attackers preferred to upload their malicious tooling to the\nC:\\ProgramData\\temp or C:\\ProgramData\\media directories and executed commands\nusing batch files (x.bat). A full list of the filenames of the suspected attacker tooling can\nbe found in the report appendices.\n\n\n-----\n\nBITSAdmin example commands used by the attackers.\n\nIn order to exfiltrate the compromised data, the attackers employed custom malware\nthat used Dropbox as its C2. They also used WinRAR and cURL for Windows, both often\nrenamed, to compress and upload the exfiltrated files from the Visma network to the\nDropbox API.\n\nOur research partner Rapid7 investigated the Dropbox use and found that the\nattackers had used the same account to store exfiltrated data from a global apparel\ncompany. They also identified broadly similar TTPs being used in the attack against a\nU.S. law firm specializing in intellectual property law. The firm has a dedicated China\npractice aimed at assisting Chinese companies entering the U.S. market.\n\nRapid7’s investigation revealed the law firm was first targeted in late 2017, followed by\nthe apparel company a few months later, and finally, the Visma attack in August 2018.\nIn one of the attacks, Rapid7 identified the attackers escaping a Citrix application in\norder to run the payload script on the victim desktop. Interestingly, in all three attacks,\nthe targeting of Citrix remote desktops was a common thread. Additionally, the same\nDLL sideloading technique observed in the Visma attack was used, and many of the\ntools deployed by the attackers shared naming similarities as well (1.bat, cu.exe, ss.rar,\nr.exe, pd.exe). Most interestingly, Rapid7 observed the use of the Notepad++ updater\ngup.exe as a legitimate executable to sideload a malicious DLL (libcurl.dll) in order to\ndeploy a variant of the UPPERCUT backdoor (also known as ANEL). APT10 used this\n[approach to deploy UPPERCUT when targeting Japanese corporations in July 2018.](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2018/09/apt10-targeting-japanese-corporations-using-updated-ttps.html)\n\n### The Visma Attack\n\nAPT10 actors gained initial access to the Visma network around August 17, 2018.\nExamination of network logs revealed an employee’s credentials were stolen and used\nto authenticate to the network outside of her normal working hours. While we are\nconfident that APT10 actors gained access to the Visma network in August using stolen\nemployee Citrix remote desktop credentials, it is not clear how or when these\ncredentials were initially compromised.\n\nThroughout August 2018, the APT10 actors regularly logged in to the Visma network\nvia accessible Citrix servers using two valid user accounts. The times of the logins were\nconsistent with a GMT+8 timezone, indicative of typical Tianjin, China working hours.\nOn each occasion, the logins were from one of eight VPN endpoints that resolved to IPs\nin the following tightly defined subnets:\n\n**Subnet** **Registration** **AS**\n\n\n104.237.86.0/24 Los Angeles Cloud,\nHostAware\n\n\nAS32181 — GigeNET\n\n\n-----\n\n45.62.52.0/24 Los Angeles Cloud,\nHostAware\n\n\nAS32181 — GigeNET\n\n\n173.239.198.0/24 VPN Consumer Network AS36351 — SoftLayer Technologies\nInc.\n\nVPN Consumer Network is an ambiguous Panama-registered entity. Based on\ninformation in WHOIS registration records, the website for the company is\nvpnconsumer.com, which is a nondescript landing page only containing the abuse\ncontact details and a physical address in Panama. BGP routing information shows that\nthe organization manages 44/24 subnets hosted around the world, many of which\nresolve to low-cost VPN services, such as ExpressVPN.\n\nInsikt Group analysis of network metadata to and from the VPN endpoint IPs revealed\nconsistent connectivity to Citrix-hosted infrastructure from all eight VPN endpoint IPs\nstarting on August 17, 2018 — the same date the first authenticated login to Visma’s\nnetwork was made using stolen credentials.\n\nAfter almost two weeks, on August 30, 2018, APT10 attackers used their access to the\nnetwork to move laterally and made their first deployment of an RC4- and Salsa20[encrypted variant of the Trochilus malware using a previously associated DLL](https://www.pwc.co.uk/cyber-security/pdf/cloud-hopper-annex-b-final.pdf)\nsideloading technique. Two separate infection chains leveraging this specific DLL\nsideloading technique were identified on the Visma network using legitimate known\ngood binaries that had DLL search-order path issues. This means that APT10 actors\nhad two separate access points into the Visma network.\n\n### Infection Chain 1: August 30, 2018\n\nOnce on the Visma network, APT10 attackers used the Microsoft BITSAdmin CLI tool to\ncopy malicious tools from a suspected attacker-controlled C2 hosted on\n173.254.236[.]158 to the \\ProgramData\\temp\\ directory on the infected host.\n\nThe copied files included:\n\nA legitimate binary for the uninstaller for PDF printing application PDF-Xchange\n2011 Lite DE, renamed from unins000.exe to CASTSP.exe\n(f6e0f076e27391a6e6eb23f23f77c2ff078488875113df388640aca8bf4dd64b)\nAn accompanying malicious DLL, version.dll\n(10182f0e64b765db989c158402c76eb1e0e862cab407f7c5cec133d8e5cb73e3)\nA DES-encrypted shellcode configuration containing the Trochilus implant into\nthe same folder\n(42b5eb1f77a25ad73202d3be14e1833ef0502b0b6ae7ab54f5d4b5c2283429c6)\n\nAfter the files were copied across the attacker-executed CASTSP.exe, this file\nsideloaded and ran version.dll, which in turn decrypted and decompressed the\nencrypted shellcode and injected the Trochilus payload into memory.\n\n\n-----\n\nInfection Chain 1.\n\n### Infection Chain 2: September 4, 2018\n\nA few days later, APT10 used an almost identical approach used during Infection Chain\n1 to deploy Trochilus onto another part of Visma’s network. While the deployed DLL\nand the encrypted shellcode were named differently, the underlying method of\nmalware installation was the same as Infection Chain 1. The files remotely copied into\nC:\\ProgramData\\temp\\ using BITSAdmin included:\n\nAnother dropper renamed to “CASTSP.exe” that this time was a legitimately\nsigned Microsoft Visual Studio binary TailoredDeploy.Host.exe (also known as\nTailoredDeploy.exe)\n(fc6a130504b54fa72cfc104c656fe2cd92d7998f42ca064e22167e1d402a1514)\nA malicious DLL, vcruntime140.dll\n(eed0c7f7d36e75382c83e945a8b00abf01d3762b973c952dec05ceccb34b487d)\nA DES-encrypted Trochilus payload\n(e6280de09f9adf79212409529eb25c0c2ea73e33a50281e22228a3db3998eecb)\n\nThe execution method was identical: CASTSP.exe sideloaded and ran vcruntime140.dll,\nwhich decrypted and decompressed the encrypted shellcode configuration and\ninjected the Trochilus payload into a system process in-memory on the host machine.\n\nInfection Chain 2.\n\n## Malware Analysis\n\nThe malware sets used for both infection chains are nearly identical both in infection\nmethod and code structure. Because the malware for both infection chains were so\nsimilar, it is only necessary to include the in-depth analysis for one chain here, so we\nfocused on Infection Chain 1. It included the binaries below:\n\nCASTSP.exe: A valid and signed application that utilizes DLL sideloading to\nexecute the malicious DLL, “version.dll”\nVersion.dll: Main functionality of “Version.dll” is to decrypt and execute the\nTrochilus payload\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Trochilus loader, version.dll, has four entry points, as shown below. The malicious\nentrypoint called by CASTSP.exe is DllEntryPoint.\n\nAfter version.dll runs, it loads the file CZYSOYKPOIKKZGUFOIUI into memory. The file\n“CZYSOYKPOIKKZGUFOIUI” is 387,094 bytes of binary code that is not human-readable.\n\nAfter the file is loaded, the next function, sub_6a351000, starts the decryption routine\nfor CZYSOYKPOIKKZGUFOIUI. The file is DES-encrypted and the key can be identified\nbeing loaded into memory at the start of the decryption routine.\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce the payload is decrypted, version.dll creates a new process in a suspended state\nand writes the Trochilus payload into the suspended process. Next, version.dll\nresumes the process, executing the Trochilus payload.\n\nTrochilus attribution.\n\n\nThis variant of Trochilus is significantly different from some of the reported variants.\nThe C2 infrastructure, network communications, and encryption are different from\nprior versions, but the code similarities and the use of DLL sideloading demonstrate\nthat this is just another variant of Trochilus. First, the libraries below are included in\nthe Trochilus variant and are known to be a part of the source code upon which\nTrochilus is based on.\n\nSelfDestruction.cpp\nMySocket.cpp\nCommManager.cpp\n\n\n1\n\n\n-----\n\nManager.cpp\nServiceManager.cpp\nTCPComm.cpp\nUDPComm.cpp\n\nSecond, the unencrypted C2 beacon, _msgid.23.__serial.0.clientid.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx, is a\nwell-defined component of the Trochilus source code.\n\nThe capabilities of Trochilus are well documented in other research reports, but the C2\ninfrastructure for this variant uses a combination of XOR, RC4, and Salsa20, which is\ndifferent from what has previously been reported for Trochilus.\n\n### Command and Control Infrastructure\n\nThe C2 domain www.miphomanager[.]com is hardcoded, and after a successful DNS\nrequest for the IP address, the Trochilus implant will use that IP address for\ncommunication.\n\nThe encoding and encryption routines used in this variant are different from other\nvariants and use three stages of encryption. Other variants have typically used XOR\nencoding with RC4 encryption to obfuscate C2 communication.\n\n### Stage 1: Rolling XOR Function\n\nThe first stage is a simple rolling XOR function. The rolling XOR key is computed by\ntaking two initial values, Constant 1 and Constant 2, and adding them together. The\nresult is then divided against the divisor 0xff. The remainder of this result is used as\nthe XOR key. On the second iteration, Constant 1 is now saved as Constant 2, and\nConstant 2 becomes the remainder from the previous operation. They are added\n\n\n-----\n\nprocess repeats until the end of the cleartext string. A Python script is provided below\nshowing this encoding function.\n\nOur analysis revealed that the “__msgid.23.” cleartext string below was sent to the XOR\nfunction above.\n\n### Stage 2: RC4 Encryption\n\nThe resulting data then goes to the second stage, which is RC4 encryption using the\nhard-coded string\nNASDKJF7832Hnkjsadf878UHds89iujkhNHKJDHJDH8UIYE98uihwjshewde8w. The main\nroutine shown below takes the key and then sends it to the function sub_B49252,\nwhich initializes the key-scheduling algorithm (KSA) and pseudo-random generation\nalgorithm (PRGA), which are the two key components of RC4 encryption.\n\n\n-----\n\np g yp yp g\nthis time with Salsa20. Salsa20 is another stream cipher that encrypts data in 64-byte\nblocks. Salsa20 uses a secret key and nonce to initialize the encryption. These values\nare hard-coded and are:\n\nSecret Key: 0x1,0x2,0x3,0x4,0x5,0x6,0x7,0x8,0x9,0xA,0xB,0xC,0xD,0xE,0xF,0x10\nNonce: 0x65,0x66,0x67,0x68,0x69,0x6A,0x6B,0x6C (“efghijkl”)\n\nAfter the message is encrypted, it is then sent via an HTTP POST to the C2 host, which\nin this case is the domain www.miphomanager[.]com. The HTTP headers are provided\nin the figure below.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Infrastructure\n\nDNS log data revealed that requests were made for the malicious Trochilus C2 domain,\nwww.miphomanager[.]com, as early as August 30, 2018 — only two weeks after Visma\nwas initially compromised on August 17, 2018. This slight delay may point to the\nhanding over of active exploitation duties to other operator(s) in a multi-team APT10\neffort within the Ministry of State Security for the attack.\n\nAccording to WHOIS information, the malicious miphomanager domain was registered\nwith a relatively small Bahamas-based domain registrar, internet.bs. This registrar is\nwidely noted to host a disproportionate number of rogue or malicious websites, with\nthe registrar aggressively marketing itself as an “offshore” registrar. Other examples of\nmalicious infrastructure registered with internet.bs include domains for APT28’s\n[VPNFilter malware campaign and the registration of the cyber-berkut[.]org domain](https://threatconnect.com/blog/russia-hacks-bellingcat-mh17-investigation/)\nthat was affiliated with the pro-Russian and potentially Russian state-linked threat\nactor CyberBerkut.\n\nThe registrant organization name was privacy protected using Whois Privacy Corp, and\nthe registered name servers for the malicious C2 were listed as:\n\nNs-canada.topdns[.]com\nNs-uk.topdns[.]com\nNs-usa.topdns[.]com\n\nInternet.bs and the name servers listed above were noted in the registration of a\n[malicious C2 used in a KHRAT campaign targeting Cambodia. KHRAT is a backdoor](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-updated-khrat-malware-used-in-cambodia-attacks/)\ntrojan purported to be used with the China-linked cyberespionage group DragonOK.\n\nAll three name servers appear in Recorded Future with an unusual risk rating as they\nappear in the “Bambenek Consulting C&C Nameserver Blocklist” threat list, because of\ntheir prevalence in being associated with a Zeus-based banking trojan, Sphinx.\n\n### Credential Harvesting and Exfiltration\n\nDuring our investigation, we also found evidence of a legitimate decompression utility\ntypically packaged with Java named “unpack200.exe” being executed on the Visma\nnetwork. This utility sideloaded Mimikatz (pd.exe) and enabled credential theft from\n\n\n-----\n\nwas used by the same attackers in both the apparel company and U.S.-based law firm\nbreaches.\n\nUsing the newly acquired credentials, the attacker accessed Visma’s Microsoft Active\nDirectory domain controller, deployed Trochilus, and made a copy of the “NTDS.DIT”\ndatabase file containing Active Directory data for Visma’s corporate network, including\npassword hashes for all users in the domain.\n\nThe NTDS.DIT file and accompanying stolen data was then packaged up using a\nrenamed WinRAR executable (r.exe) that was transferred across by the attacker who\nthen used cURL for Windows (renamed to “CU.exe”) to upload the exfil to\ncontent.dropboxapi.com. The RAR files followed a naming convention of a short run of\nrepeating characters (for example, kkk.rar, ss.rar, pp.rar, dds.rar, gggg.rar, etc).\n\nRapid7 research revealed the exfiltrated content from Visma was uploaded to a\nDropbox account that contained files from another incident related to the compromise\nof an international apparel company that they were investigating.\n\n### US-Based Law Firm Attack\n\nIn late 2017, Rapid7 responded to a breach at a U.S.-based law firm. The attacker first\ngained access to the victim environment through Citrix servers. Once inside the victim\nnetwork, the attacker deployed their own customized malware and also used known\ngood binaries that have DLL search order hijacking issues in order to perform DLL\nsideloading to execute customized versions of Mimikatz in order to retrieve\npasswords. The filename for the custom malware was “ccSEUPDT.exe” (MD5:\nd8e37f07fdc9827871f0f959519275e1), a legitimate Symantec Security Submission\nEngine Update Module binary. The custom malware also would have a DLL in the same\nstaging directory and a randomized 15-character uppercase and lowercase alpha\ncharacter set filename without an extension that contained the shellcode. The attacker\nused unpack200.exe (MD5: 6807be8466955bafffa568b6da0e785c), a decompression\nprogram that comes with Java 8 and their copy of Mimikatz was placed into\nMSVCR100.DLL (MD5: c8ea12ee884f274ca35fa54a073df130).\n\nThese methods of initial ingress into the victim networks and the method of obtaining\npasswords remained consistent TTPs across all victims. The DLL sideloading technique\ncan evade application whitelisting and antivirus software. However, if deployed,\nsystems that perform process.start creation would log the command line being passed\nto the binary and could be reviewed, and then signatures created that look for the\ncommon flags could be passed to Mimikatz. The attacker would also move laterally by\nmounting the remote drive on a system, copying “1.bat” to it, use task scheduler to\nexecute, and then delete the batch script.\n\nIn order to perform exfiltration of the stolen data, the attacker used common file\ncompression utilities (rar.exe) to create archives of the information they intended to\nexfiltrate, and then used common command line-based web clients (curl.exe) to\ntransfer the stolen data to a cloud-based storage provider (Dropbox). This TTP for data\n\n\n-----\n\ndeployed password-protected ASP eval webshells (Filename “iisstart.aspx,” SHA256:\n243d47fc2a24b391e1153d5c7807c6e5de51aba65fc79465d7b3e5c64d5fac41) within\nthe client environment in order to maintain access.\n\nServer-side ASPX payload of the China Chopper webshell. (Source: Rapid7)\n\nThis resembled the server-side ASPX payload of the China Chopper webshell\n[documented previously. Uploads to VirusTotal in late August 2018 resembling the](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2013/08/breaking-down-the-china-chopper-web-shell-part-i.html)\nsame filename, iisstart.aspx, indicate the deployed webshell was likely a version of the\nChina Chopper webshell known to have been used by several Chinese threat actors.\n\nThe attacker also used TeamViewer in order to maintain remote access to\ncompromised systems within the victim environment.\n\n### International Apparel Company Attack\n\nIn early 2018, Rapid7 identified that the attackers compromised an apparel company,\nbased upon detections and intelligence gathered from the U.S.-based law firm breach.\nThe attacker gained access to the victim’s internet-accessible Citrix systems and\nauthenticated to them from networks associated with low-cost VPN providers owned\nby VPN Consumer Network. Rapid7 again observed the attackers dropping payloads\nnamed “ccSEUPDT.exe.” The attackers used identical TTPs for executing malware and\nMimikatz as observed before, by using DLL sideloading with known good binaries that\nhad DLL search order path issues. The attackers used the Notepad++ updater GUP.exe\n(MD5: f5322b2f18605674b9a0c1757de5fd94), the Java archive decompression utility\nunpack200.exe (MD5: 6807be8466955bafffa568b6da0e785c), renamed from\n“coInst.exe,” and Norton Identity Safe binary CASRTSP.exe (MD5:\n1e3a57cff7cba8732364c26f4bbdcbe2). These binaries were used to load malware from\nDLL files MSVCR100.DLL (MD5: 5739c1f17503e21e56667d53ea823401) and libcurl.dll\n(MD5: 8f07160febdb240909b27aa519bba575). Rapid7 reviewed malware discovered in\nthe victim’s environment and found implants that used Dropbox as the C2. The\nattackers used the same method of lateral movement by mounting the remote drive\non a system, copying 1.bat to it, using task scheduler to execute the batch script, and\nfinally, deleting the batch script.\n\nFor exfiltration of stolen data, the attacker used WinRAR and renamed “rar.exe” to\n“r.exe” to create archives, upload them with “curl.exe” (renamed to “c.exe”), and again,\nuse the cloud storage provider Dropbox. Rapid7 discovered that additional data was\nplaced into the Dropbox accounts under control of the attacker during the\ncompromise and was able to attribute data that was placed into it as being owned by\nVisma. Rapid7 then provided a breach notification to Visma to alert them to this\ncompromise in September 2018.\n\n## Outlook\n\n\n-----\n\nsignificantly, indicating a wide scope of targeting for the group. We assess with high\nconfidence that the attacks were conducted by Chinese MSS threat actor, APT10, based\non the evidence outlined in this report, summarized below:\n\n1. The use of a variant of the Trochilus malware. While the variant has not been\n\n[noted publicly previously, Trochilus is widely used by APT10.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/two-birds-one-stone-panda/)\n2. The use of legitimate binaries to sideload malicious DLLs that decrypt and\n\ndecompress shellcode configuration files containing a Trochilus payload.\n3. The use of Notepad++ updater (filename “gup.exe”) to load malicious DLL\n\n(libcurl.dll) in the deployment of the APT10 backdoor, UPPERCUT.\n4. Extensive use of command-line tools including, but not limited to, Mimikatz, cURL\n\nfor Windows, BITSAdmin, and WinRAR, to perform actions on-host.\n5. The targeting of a Norwegian MSP, which enabled potential access to an\n\nextensive customer base. We believe that the APT10 targeting of Visma is an\nextension of their 2017 Cloud Hopper operation (which victimized some of the\nworld’s largest MSPs) and has continued into late 2018.\n6. The unauthorized access to Citrix remote desktop clients at Visma using stolen\n\ncredentials occured at times corresponding to Tianjin working hours (GMT +8).\n\nWe believe APT10 is the most significant known Chinese state-sponsored cyber threat\nto global corporations. Their unprecedented campaign against MSPs, alleged to have\nincluded some of the largest MSPs in the world, in order to conduct secondary attacks\nagainst their clients, grants the Chinese state the ability to potentially access the\nnetworks of hundreds (if not thousands) of corporations around the world.\n\nThis campaign brings to light further evidence supporting the assertions made by the\nFive Eyes nations, led by the U.S. Department of Justice indictment against APT10\nactors outlining the unprecedented scale of economic cyberespionage being\nconducted by the Chinese Ministry of State Security. Crucially, the variety of businesses\ntargeted prove that these campaigns are being conducted against corporations across\nthe commercial spectrum, aimed at undermining international norms in trade to\nerode the competitive advantage of companies that have invested heavily in patented\ntechnology.\n\nThis report, alongside the plethora of other reporting on APT10 operations, acutely\nhighlights the vulnerability of organizational supply chains. Often, third parties in the\nsupply chain are less likely to adopt high-end, expensive security measures, and\ntherefore offer an attacker a convenient access vector to target interconnected\norganizations. Also, the targeting of cloud providers exploits the trust companies place\nin the security of the cloud services they use.\n\nBased on available information, we assess that this intrusion was conducted by the\ngroup that is known as APT10. However, during the course of this investigation, we\nhave had privileged conversations that lead us to believe that in the future, portions of\nwhat is now known as APT10 will be recategorized as a new group. There is insufficient\ndata at this time to make that distinction.\n\n\n-----\n\nRecorded Future recommends organizations conduct the following measures outlined\nin this section in conjunction with the advice published by US-CERT and the U.K.’s2\nNCSC when defending against APT10 attempts to gain network access.3\n\nConfigure your intrusion detection systems (IDS), intrusion prevention systems\n(IPS), or any network defense mechanisms in place to alert on — and upon\nreview, consider blocking illicit connection attempts from — the external IP\naddresses and domains listed in Appendix A.\nImplement the provided SNORT rules in Appendix B into your IDS and IPS\nappliance and investigate any alerts generated for activity resembling the TTPs\noutlined in this report on APT10.\nConduct regular Yara scans across your enterprise for the new rules listed in\nAppendix C and those listed in the official U.S. and U.K. government advisories\nlisted above.\nConsider blocking any connection attempts emanating from IPs resolving to “VPN\nConsumer Network” (listed in Appendix B) and consider implementing a VPN\nwhitelisting policy based on approved vendors.\nDetection of potential ASP eval webshells can be difficult, but can be\naccomplished by deploying file integrity monitoring of the web root directories\non all servers with a client environment.\nDetection of exfiltration based on network flow data would be difficult if the\nattacker chose to use the same cloud storage provider that the victim has\nstandardized upon. However, if SSL is proxied for monitoring, signatures can be\ncreated to identify this activity by checking the user agent or method of client\nheader construction against the Dropbox client applications themselves.\nEnsure you have DNS response policy zones enabled for your enterprise. If so,\nconsider detecting, alerting, and blocking requests for the nameservers below\nassociated with the disproportionately malicious domain registrar internet.bs:\n\nns-uk.topdns.com\nns-usa.topdns.com\nns-canada.topdns.com\n\n[To view a full list of the associated indicators of compromise, download the appendix.](https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2019-0206.pdf)\n\n\n[1https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA17-117A,](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA17-117A)\n\nhttps://www.carbonblack.com/2017/05/09/carbon-black-threat-research-dissects-redleaves-malware-leverages-dll-side-loading/,\nhttps://blogs.jpcert.or.jp/en/2017/04/redleaves—malware-based-on-open-sourcerat.html\n\n[2https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA17-117A, https://www.us-cert.gov/APTs-](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA17-117A)\n\nTargeting-IT-Service-Provider-Customers, https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA18276B\n\n\n3https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/content/files/protected_files/article_files/APT10%20alert%20\n\nv2 0 pdf\n\n\n-----\n\nCopyright © 2019 Recorded Future, INC.\n\n\n-----",
