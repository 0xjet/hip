We want to share information\nabout what we are doing and how the ecosystem is responding, so this is the first of what we expect\nwill be many reports that will provide in-depth insight into the security of the Android ecosystem.\n\nIn 2014, the Android platform made numerous significant improvements in platform security\ntechnology, including enabling deployment of full disk encryption, expanding the use of hardwareprotected cryptography, and improving the Android application sandbox with an SELinuxbased Mandatory Access Control system (MAC). Developers were also provided with improved\ntools to detect and react to security vulnerabilities, including the nogotofail project and the\nSecurityProvider. We provided device manufacturers with ongoing support for fixing security\nvulnerabilities in devices, including development of 79 security patches, and improved the ability to\nrespond to potential vulnerabilities in key areas, such as the updateable WebView in Android 5.0.\n\nGoogle’s security services for Android increased protection for users and improved visibility into\nattempts to exploit Android. Ongoing monitoring by Verify Apps found that efforts to deliver\nPotentially Harmful Applications (PHAs) continued\n\n###### Google’s security services for\n\nat low levels throughout 2014, less than 1% of all\ndevices had a PHA installed.

Exploitation attempts were tracked for multiple vulnerabilities, and the\ndata does not show any evidence of widespread exploitation of Android devices.\n\n1. The security industry often uses the term “malware” with little or no definition. To avoid potential confusion, the Android security team instead uses\nthe term Potentially Harmful Application (PHA) to refer to applications which pose a security risk to users or their data. More detail on the types of\n\n\n-----\n\n## New Android Security Features / Capabilities\n\nThere were two major updates to Android in the 12 months ending Nov 1, 2014[2]: Android 4.4 and\nthe preview of Android 5.0. Both of these platform releases included security improvements as\nwell as patches for newly discovered vulnerabilities. By February 2, 2015, Android 4.4 has become\nthe most widely distributed version of Android with over 41% of Android devices that check in to\nGoogle services running Android 4.4 or greater[3]. Here are a few of the security highlights from those\nreleases:\n\n##### Android sandbox reinforced with SELinux.\n\nAndroid 4.4 required that SELinux be in enforcing mode for select system domains, and Android\n5.0 now requires SELinux in enforcing mode for all domains. SELinux is a mandatory access\ncontrol (MAC) system in the Linux kernel used to augment the existing discretionary access control\n(DAC) security model. This new layer provides additional protection against potential security\nvulnerabilities by reducing exposure of system functionality to applications.\n\n###### Improved Full Disk Encryption.\nFull Device Encryption was introduced with Android 3.0, using the Android screen\nlock secret to wrap a device encryption key that is not sent off the device or exposed\nto any application. Starting with Android 5.0, the user password is protected against\nbrute-force attacks using scrypt and, where available, the key is bound to the\nhardware keystore to prevent off-device password brute-forcing attacks. On devices\nthat ship with Android 5.0 out-of-the-box, full disk encryption can be enabled by\ndefault to improve protection of data on lost or stolen devices.\n\n###### Multi user, restricted profile, and guest modes for phones & tablets.\nAndroid 4.2 introduced multiple users on tablet devices. Android 5.0 provides for\nmultiple users on phones and includes a guest mode that can be used to provide\neasy temporary access to your device without granting access to your data and apps.\n\n###### Improved authentication for phones and tablets.\nAndroid 5.0 introduced Smart Lock trustlets that provide more flexibility for\nunlocking devices. For example, trustlets can allow devices to be unlocked\nautomatically when close to another trusted device (via NFC, Bluetooth) or being\nused by someone with a trusted face.\n\n2. Unless otherwise specified, data within this paper is from the 12 month period between Nov 1, 2013 and Nov 1, 2014. For the rest of this paper\nwe’ll used simplified phrase “in 2014” to describe that time period, even though it means some of the data came from the last 2 months of 2013.\nWhere a more precise time period is noteworthy, it will be explicitly described.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Enhanced Google security services for Android\n\nGoogle also enhanced the security of the Android ecosystem by expanding the set of security\nservices that are included in the Google applications that run on the Android Platform. Enhanced\nGoogle security services for Android. Google Play provides security scanning of all applications\nprior to availability for download and continues to provide ongoing security checks for as long as\nthe application is available in Google Play. Since 2012, Google Play has also offered a service called\nVerify Apps that provides protection from apps outside of Google Play. This check for potentially\nharmful behavior at the time of application install was initially available for Android 4.2 and later, and\nwas expanded in 2013 to protect all devices with Android 2.3 and greater. In April, we announced\nthat Verify Apps was providing enhanced protections with ongoing security scans for applications\nand other threats. There are currently two types of security services provided by Google Play for all\nAndroid users:\n\n###### Protection within Google Play:\n\nReview of all applications in Google Play for potentially harmful behavior and ongoing protection for\napps downloaded from Google Play. Review is described in more detail on page 15 of this report.\n\n###### Verify Apps Protection with Safety Net outside of Google Play:\n\nProtection for all apps regardless of source of install. This includes a technology code-named\n“Safety Net” that detects and protects against non app-based security threats such as network\nattacks. Users who use Verify Apps may also upload applications to Google to improve detection of\nPotentially Harmful Applications from sources outside of Google Play.\n\n##### There are over 1 billion devices protected by Google Play.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Improve ability to enhance security without full system OTAs.\n\nIn May, Google Play Services introduced an updateable Security Provider that allows\napplication developers to use a version of SSL provided and maintained by Google Play\nServices. Applications that use this Security Provider will have updated cryptography without\nany need for a system OTA. With Android 5.0, WebView can now be updated by Google\nindependent of the Android framework and without a system OTA.\n\n###### Developer Security Warnings. \n\nIn July 2014, Google Play began to use automated systems to find potential vulnerabilities in\napplications published in Google Play. Google Play can now provide developers with proactive\nwarnings within the Developer Console and via email about security issues affecting their apps.\nThese include warnings about potentially dangerous storage of credentials, use of out-of-date\nopen source libraries, and other best practices. These warnings help improve the overall state\nof software security in the mobile ecosystem. To date, over 25,000 applications have been\nupdated and no longer contain the potential security issue.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Response to Vulnerabilities Found in 2014\n\nIn 2014, the Android Security Team rated severity of all vulnerabilities using a 4-tier rating system\nthat combines potential for privilege escalation and risk of exploitation, as follows:\n\n###### Severity Representative issues with this level of severity\n\n\n###### Critical\n\n High\n\n Moderate\n\n Low\n\n\nActive exploitation gaining remote execution with Android\npermissions of Protection Level Dangerous or System through\nnormal use of device.\n\nRemote execution with ability to run with Android permissions\nof Protection Level Dangerous. Local privilege escalation to root\nor system by nonprivileged programs. (potential rooting PHA)\nRemote access to data protected with Android permissions of\nProtection Level Dangerous. Moderate or higher severity issue\nwith significant press coverage. (User fear is a real harm.)\n\nLocal privilege escalation to Android permissions of Protection\nLevel Dangerous. Local access to sensitive data without\nappropriate privilege. Shell user (ADB) escalation to root\n(potential unauthorized user device rooting). Denial of Service\nthat renders a device unusable. High severity issue, mitigated\nby device specificity, or user interaction. Remote execution\nwith ability to run with Android permissions of Protection Level\nNormal.\n\nUnauthorized local access to data that is not considered\nsensitive. Denial of Service that can be stopped by normal user\naction such as system restart or application removal. Other,\nlimited violation of the Android security model.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn 2014, the Android security team provided patches for 41 Moderate, 30 High, and 8 Low\nSeverity vulnerabilities. There were no critical vulnerabilities found in 2014. To provide OEMs with\nopportunity to patch prior to disclosure, patches are provided to partners but not publicly disclosed\nuntil the next API update to AOSP. At that time, patches are released to open source.\n\n###### Currently, 73 of the issues patched in 2014 have been released to AOSP, and 6 will be released with the next update to AOSP.\n\nIn addition to providing fixes in the platform level, the\n\n###### In addition to providing fixes\n\nAndroid Security Team monitors vulnerabilities for\nattempted abuse using Verify Apps, Safety Net, and **in the platform level, the**\nother systems. Significant exploitation has only been **Android Security Team monitors**\nseen for one vulnerability identified in 2014, **vulnerabilities for attempted**\nCVE-2014-3153: Local privilege escalation in futex syscall.\n\n###### abuse using Verify Apps, Safety\n\nAn exploit of this vulnerability was included in a number\n\n###### Net, and other systems.\n\nof rooting tools. We also continued to monitor levels of\nexploitation of over 25 other publicly known local privilege escalation vulnerabilities. Many of these\nvulnerabilities had patches available prior to 2014, but there are devices that have not been patched\nfor all publicly known vulnerabilities.\n\nRooting tools are prohibited within Google Play. Verify Apps has seen Rooting applications installed\non approximately 0.25% of devices, with those installs from sources outside of Google Play. With\nrespect to “malicious” applications, less than 1 out of every million installs of an application observed\nby Verify Apps abused a platform vulnerability in a manner that we think it would be appropriate to\ncharacterize as “malicious[4]”.\n\n##### We introduced an acknowledgement page for third parties that responsibly disclose security issues or otherwise contribute to Android security. The Android Security Team would again like to publicly acknowledge the contributions that more than 40 security researchers and developers have made to improve Android Security. Thank you.\n\n4. Although widespread, the use of the phrase “malicious” to describe application behavior is problematic. Although Rooting applications, for\nexample, do reduce the security of a device and may cause irreparable harm to a device we do not believe they should be considered malicious\nas long as the behavior is adequately disclosed to the user. This is clearly distinct from an application which attempts to use a vulnerability to gain\nprivileges without the users’ awareness. Google does classify Rooting applications as “Potentially Harmful Applications” so they are prohibited\nin Google Play and users of Verify Apps will receive a warning prior to installation of such an application. We separately classify applications that\nexercise a vulnerability and appear to be attempting to mislead or harm the user intentionally as “Rooting - Malicious” -- such applications are\n\n\n-----\n\n###### SSL Vulnerabilities\n\nIn 2014, there were a number of high-profile vulnerabilities **The most significant**\naffecting implementations of SSL. The most significant **vulnerability affecting most**\nvulnerability affecting most platforms, Heartbleed, had limited\n\n###### platforms, Heartbleed, had\n\nimpact on Android as it affected only Android 4.1.1 devices.\n\n###### limited impact on Android\n\nWe have expanded monitoring capability in Safety Net to look\n\n###### as it affected only Android\n\nfor SSLv3 and other ciphersuite downgrade attacks. We have\nseen limited exploitation that appears to be research related[4]. **4.1.1 devices.**\nTo date, we have not seen evidence of widespread exploitation of these vulnerabilities affecting\nAndroid. More details on data related to network based exploits is included in the Safety Net\nData section.\n\n\n###### Android Vulnerabilities\n\nA vulnerability affecting Android 4.4 and earlier received broad attention following disclosure at\nBlack Hat. This vulnerability was named FakeID and was formally identified as Android-13678484. In\naddition to providing a patch for this issue, Google has monitored potential exploitation via Verify\nApps and Google Play. In 2014, we blocked one instance of an app uploaded to Google Play that\nexploited this vulnerability. Outside of Google Play, Verify Apps also warns users about applications\nthat exercise this vulnerability. Verify Apps identified 258 unique applications that exercise this\nvulnerability, and they were installed less than once for every 1 million installs checked by Verify\nApps.\n\n##### Many of the FakeID installs have characteristics that associate them with security research, and we have not identified any attempted exploitation that we would consider “malicious”[5].\n\n###### OEM/ SOC Specific Vulnerabilites\n\nAndroid devices are generally implemented by an Original Equipment Manufacture (OEM) in\npartnership with a System On a Chip (SOC) to implement a kernel and device drivers that enable the\nAndroid Platform. Although not strictly part of the open-source Android Platform, these components\nare critical to the security of specific Android devices.\n\n5. A note on observation of exploitation: As with any data collected in large volume from in-the-field observation, there is non-zero chance of both false\npositives and false negatives. We are presenting the data to the best of our understanding. Due to the methods that we use to collect exploitation\ndata, it is not possible to have certainty that a lack of observation means no exploitation has occurred. Conversely, it is also possible that some of the\ndata that suggests possible exploitation is in fact innocuous. While we extensively test our detection mechanisms to ensure accuracy, privacy controls\nd il d i i i i ifi i f l i i b d i d d\n\n\n-----\n\nThere have been multiple OEM- or SOC-specific kernel **The inclusion of SELinux**\nvulnerabilities in 2014.

Similar research **chance of exploitation of**\ninto methods to reduce the possibility of vulnerabilities in **these vulnerabilities.**\nOEM/SOC specific code is being conducted by major OEMs and SOC vendors.\n\nAdditionally, we also monitor these vulnerabilities for attempted abuse using Google Play,\nVerify Apps, Safety Net, and other systems. A number of exploits for these vulnerabilities were\nincorporated into rooting tools that collect multiple device-specific vulnerabilities into a single tool.\n\n##### We observed use of exploits for SOC/OEM-specific vulnerabilities in a manner that we would think it would be appropriate to characterize as “malicious” in fewer than 1 out of every million installs in 2014.\n\n###### Application Vulnerabilites\n\nIn 2014, the Android Security Team provided updated security tips for developers and issued\nnew guidance on best practices for secure use of SSL in Android applications. We also launched\na developer notification service in Google Play and thousands of developers have been notified\nof potential vulnerabilities affecting their applications. If you are a security researcher who needs\nassistance in contacting a large number of developers about a potential security vulnerability in their\napplication(s), please contact the Android security team at security@android.com.\n\n##### In addition to providing developers with assistance in updating their applications, in some instances Google Play and Verify Apps are able to monitor and/or block potential exploitation of application vulnerabilities.\n\nFor example, Google Play policy prohibits applications that attempt to send data from the SDCard\nor External Storage off the device without user consent, which provides limited protection for\napplication data that may be inadvertently stored in that world-readable location.\n\nIn 2014, we observed applications attempting to take messages that were stored on the SDCard\nby a popular messaging platform. Those applications are categorized as Potentially Harmful\nApplications. They are prohibited in Google Play and Verify Apps and Safebrowsing warns users\nabout them outside of Google Play. We also worked with the messaging platform developer to\nchange the format of their data to reduce risk to users That was the only example we observed of\n\n\n-----\n\n## Measures of Ecosystem Security\n\nThere are over one billion devices that are protected by **There are over one billion**\nGoogle’s security services for Android. Through aggregated\n\n###### devices that are protected\n\nsecurity data sent from these devices, we can gain a broad\n\n###### by Google’s security\n\nunderstanding of the security environment for mobile\n\n###### services for Android.\n\ndevices. This includes information about Potentially Harmful\nApplications as well as attempted abuse of sensitive APIs and vulnerabilities at the device and\nnetwork level.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Scope of User Protection & Ecosystem Measurement\n\nVerify Apps was launched in November 2012. In the first 12 months of availability, the service\ngrew rapidly to checking for Potentially Harmful Applications (PHAs) for millions of install attempts\nper day. In the next 12 months, which are the focus of this report, installs checked by Verify Apps\nhave grown by nearly 300%. This compounding growth rate is one of the reasons that Google\nrecommends against use of any absolute counts when evaluating potential risk to users within the\nAndroid ecosystem. As Android’s ecosystem continues to grow, absolute counts will continue to grow\nregardless of actual risk associated with an action or device. To provide an accurate understanding of\nrisk, the Android Security Team “normalizes” statistics relative to an action or device.\n\n##### During 2014, Google Play provided security checks prior to publication for all applications published to Google Play and millions of installs per day from outside of Google Play.\n\n**Growth in Installs Checked by Verify Apps in 2014**\n\n300%\n\n200%\n\n100%\n\n11-20-13 01-17-14 03-16-14 05-13-14 07-10-14 09-06-14\n\n\n**Growth in Installs Checked by Verify Apps in 2014**\n\n300%\n\n200%\n\n100%\n\n11-20-13 01-17-14 03-16-14 05-13-14 07-10-14 09-06-14\n\n\n-----\n\n##### In March 2014, Verify Apps was enhanced to provide background scanning for potential security issues and Potentially Harmful Applications.\n\nThe graph below shows the growth in the number of devices using this service, which has grown to\ncover nearly all Android devices that check-in with any Google service.\nBy default, device scans are run approximately once per\nweek which initially introduced periodic usage spikes that **Volume for the week**\nhave been gradually removed by introducing randomness\n\n###### prior to 11/1/2014 was\n\ninto the schedule for each device.

(Devices were\nstill protected with install time Verify Apps during this\nperiod). Volume for the week prior to 11/1/2014 was just over 200 million devices scanned per day.\n\n**Number of Device Scans**\n\n300M\n\n225M\n\n150M\n\n75.0M\n\n0.00\n\n4-12-14 4-30-14 5-19-14 6-06-14 6-24-14 7-12-14 7-31-14 8-18-14 9-05-14 9-24-14 10-12-14 10-30-14\n\n\n**Number of Device Scans**\n\n300M\n\n225M\n\n150M\n\n75.0M\n\n0.00\n\n\n-----\n\nThe following two graphs shows basic language information associated with these install events\noutside of Google Play.\n\n##### For privacy reasons, Verify Apps only collects data needed to provide and improve device security. It does not access any personal information, nor does it check the physical location of the device.\n\nAndroid devices have a device locale that can be configured by the user to provide localized user\nexperience. Locale provides both the language of device and a region that can be associated with\nthe language (for example Spanish has unique locales for Mexico, Spain, The United States, etc.).\nWithin Verify Apps data, the device locale allows us to provide warnings in an appropriate language\nusing region-specific characteristics of the language. The locale does not provide location of the\ndevice, per se, as a device of any locale can be in any physical location (devices may also change\nlocation without changing locale, and vice versa) but it allows us to roughly segment data by country,\nallowing Google’s analysts to identify regional biases in the product (e.g., effects of localized warning\nstrings) and the ecosystem (e.g., prevalence of certain types of potentially harmful apps).\n\n**Scans at Install by Locale**\n\n###### Misc.\n\n en_US\n\n fr_FR in_ID\n\n ja_JP\n\n\n###### ru_RU\n\n\n###### zh_CN\n\n\n###### ko_KR en_GB\n\nThe Verify Apps user base is generally reflective of the worldwide mobile user population\n\n\n-----\n\nChina is a unique market for Android in that Google services are not widely available. We believe\nbased on numerous industry reports that there may be several hundred million Android devices in\nChina.\n\n##### In the 7 days prior to 11/1/2014, 14 million Chinese language devices used Verify Apps, and, in that 7-day period, Chinese language devices had installed 39 million apps.\n\nSo, although Google is not able to provide the same broad ecosystem-wide protection for Chinese\ndevices, over 10 million active devices do provide significant visibility into regional variations that are\nunique to Chinese devices.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Classification of Potentially Harmful Applications\n\nAll Potentially Harmful Applications (PHAs) are prohibited **Google’s systems use machine**\nfrom Google Play by policy -- this includes any application **learning to see patterns**\nthat can potentially harm the user, their device, or their data.\n\n###### and make connections that\n\nBefore applications become available in Google Play, they\n\n###### humans would not.\n\nundergo an application security review process to confirm\nthat they comply with Google Play policies, prohibiting potentially harmful applications. Google’s\nsystems use machine learning to see patterns and make connections that humans would not. Google\nPlay analyzes millions of data points, asset nodes, and relationship graphs to build a high-precision\nsecurity-detection system.\n\nThe signals and results are continuously monitored and refined to reduce error rate and improve\nprecision.\n\n##### Here are some of the ways that our machines learn what is benign and what is potentially harmful:\n\n###### Signatures\nSignatures are used to compare apps against a database of known apps and vulnerabilities.\n\n###### Static analysis\nAll application features are extracted and analyzed against expected benign behavior and potentially\nharmful behavior. This includes static analysis of all code within the application.\n\n###### Dynamic analysis\nApplications are run to identify dynamic behavior that cannot be extracted with static analysis. Dynamic\nanalysis allows reviewers to identify data-driven attacks that require connection to a server and\ndynamic downloading of code.\n\n###### Heuristic and similarity analysis\nWe compare applications with each other to find trends that lead to harmful apps. For example, if 80%\nof recent harmful applications have <quality XX> then we may double check any application that also\ndeclares <quality XX>.\n\n###### Developer relationships\nNon-code features are analyzed to determine possible relationships between applications and to\nevaluate whether the developer that created the application may have previously been associated with\ncreation of Potentially Harmful Applications.\n\n###### Third-party reports\n\n\n-----\n\nThis same analysis is conducted for applications that Google has found outside of Google Play\nto deliver the Verify Apps feature. For users who have enabled protection for applications that\nare downloaded from outside Google Play, Verify Apps provides users with a warning based on\nclassifying the application into 14 different categories.\n\nAs of 11/1/2014, the following classifications were in use: Generic PHA, Phishing, Rooting Malicious,\nRansomware, Rooting, SMS Fraud, Backdoor, Spyware, Trojan, Harmful Site, Windows Threat, NonAndroid Threat, WAP Fraud, Call Fraud. Each of these categories is associated with a warning string\nthat is provided to the user if they attempt to install a PHA or if one is detected already installed\non their device. These categories are based on PHAs that have been found in the wild on Android\ndevices or that have been demonstrated by researchers. We expect that more categories will be\nadded in the future. The most recently added categories are WAP Fraud and Ransomware, both of\nwhich were first detected affecting Android users during 2014. We have observed code associated\nwith malicious activity on other operating systems embedded within Android applications; to prevent\nunintentional transmission of this code, two categories (Windows Threat and Non-Android Threat)\nwarn users if the application shows evidence of a threat that exists for other operating systems.\nMore details on the prevalence of each of the categories of PHA will be provided later in this\ndocument.\n\n##### The vast majority of application installs are not classified as potentially harmful, so for most installations, the users of Verify Apps will see nothing displayed at the time of install.\n\nIf an application is classified as potentially harmful, then in addition to displaying the warning, Verify\nApps may either block the installation or allow the user to decide whether to allow installation to\ncontinue. An early design considered blocking all installations that were classified as potentially\nharmful, but user studies found that users might disable the feature if they disagreed with certain\nclassifications. For example, many users will proceed to install Rooting apps after a warning is\nprovided as they likely already knew that it would bypass Android security protections.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Occurrence of Potentially Harmful Applications[6]\n\nThis section will provide a detailed breakdown of information gathered from Verify Apps on the\nfrequency of occurrence of Potentially Harmful Applications (PHAs). It provides the most complete\npicture available of the overall state of the Android ecosystem with respect to PHAs. As noted\nin the introductory pages of this report, in 2014 less than 1% of all devices had a PHA installed.\nFewer than 0.15% of devices that download only from Google Play had a PHA installed. The rate of\ninstallation of PHAs from outside Google Play also decreased by nearly 60% between Q1 and Q4 of\n2014. Those findings will be explained in detail in the following pages. They will also be broken down\nby the categories of behavior and using device locale information to better identify relevant trends\nand variations within the worldwide Android ecosystem.\n\nThe broadest statistic that Verify Apps is currently tracking is the frequency with which Verify Apps\ndetects an installed Potentially Harmful Application at the time that it does a full-device scan. We\nrefer to this statistic as “device hygiene” and\n\n###### During October 2014, the lowest level\n\nbegan to collect this statistic in early October\n2014. Previously, data collection was associated **of device hygiene was 99.5% and the**\nwith an install at the time of install and could **highest level was 99.65%, so less than**\nnot be tracked at the device level. During **0.5% of devices had a PHA installed**\nOctober 2014, the lowest level of device hygiene **(excluding non-malicious Rooting apps).**\nwas 99.5% and the highest level was 99.65%, so\nless than 0.5% of devices had a PHA installed (excluding non-malicious Rooting apps). During\nthat same time period, approximately 0.25% of devices had a non-malicious Rooting application\ninstalled. The device hygiene when incorporating all PHA applications is depicted in the\nfollowing graph.\n\n**Devices without PHA (Excluding Rooting)**\n\n99.65%\n\n99.60%\n\n99.55%\n\n99.50%\n\n10-8-14 10-10-14 10-13-14 10-15-14 10-17-14 10-20-14 10-22-14 10-24-14 10-27-14 10-29-14\n\n6. A note on counting Potentially Harmful Apps (PHAs): Applications may not be classified as PHAs when first identified because later investigation\nreveals behavior that was hidden or believed to be innocuous which is actually potentially harmful. This means that the discovery of a new PHAs\ncan lead to a restating of previous install statistics. To balance the need for timeliness and accuracy, the final version of this paper paper is being\nproduced on February X, 2015 more than 60 days after 11/1/2014. Since we began collecting data in 2012, our data has shown that most PHAs are\nidentified within 60 days of installation. For “time of install” statistics, this report includes installs of PHAs that were identified as PHA after 11/1/2014 if\nthe install occurred prior to 11/1/2014. It is possible that some installations that occurred later in 2014 will be identified as PHAs in the future, but we\ndon’t expect that will have a significant effect on the overall statistics.

A note on counting Potentially Harmful Apps (PHAs): Applications may not be classified as PHAs when first identified because later investigation\nreveals behavior that was hidden or believed to be innocuous which is actually potentially harmful. This means that the discovery of a new PHAs\ncan lead to a restating of previous install statistics.

Chinese devices which install apps from\noutside of Google Play are more likely to have a non-malicious Rooting application than any other\nregion or type of PHA. About 3-4% of Chinese devices have a Rooting application installed. In fact,\nthere are numerous applications from major Chinese corporations that include rooting exploits to\nprovide functionality that is not provided by the Android API. Some of these Rooting applications\nexplicitly describe that they will use an exploit to root the device, but there are some applications\nwhich do not describe this functionality to users.

These\napplications have also been associated with target attacks against individuals, sometimes referred to\nas Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) or Spear Phishing.\n\nCommercial Spyware generally use legitimate system functionality on the device such as location\ntracking to send information to the party that installed the application and they do not have access\nto application specific information that is protected by Android’s application sandbox such as\nemail. In some instances, these applications do have the ability to access application data if the\ndevice has been previously rooted.

We do not know the exact\nreason for this increase. With respect to Commercial Spyware, there are a number of Android\nplatform level changes that are being incorporated to reduce the risk of the threat of a local\nattacker with physical access to the device. In Android 5.0, these included expanded use of device\nencryption and simplified authentication mechanisms.

This includes attempted\nexploitation of platform or application level vulnerabilities as well as network-level exploitation.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Platform API Abuse\n\nOn any open platform, there are APIs that provide valuable functionality to legitimate applications\nwhich when used inappropriately can lead to abuse. Within the Android OS, we react to this abuse\nby modifying or improving APIs, or by providing improved\n\n###### Safety Net provides a third\n\nuser notification so they can make decisions about which\n\n###### technique: detecting and\n\nbehaviors they would like to allow.

There are a number of **attempted on user devices.**\nsystem APIs that can be checked for potential abuse by applications without having access to any\nuser data.\n\n\n-----\n\n## SMS Confirmation\n\nStarting with Android 4.2, Android provides a user confirmation prompt prior to an application\nsending an SMS to a shortcode that might result in a premium service. SafetyNet aggregates these\nevents and uses them as a signal for identifying **worldwide during 2014,**\nPotentially Harmful Applications that attempt to\n\n###### approximately 12% of attempted\n\nuse premium services without user consent. This\n\n###### requests to send premium SMS\n\nalso provides high-level insight into how users\ninteract with the premium SMS warning. **were blocked.**\nAs shown in the graph below, worldwide during 2014, approximately 12% of attempted requests to\nsend premium SMS were blocked.\n\n**Fraction of SMS Sent to Premium Shortcodes Blocked by User**\n\n16.00%\n\n12.00%\n\n8.00%\n\n4.00%\n\n0.0%\n\n9-16-14 9-24-14 10-1-14 10-8-14 10-15-14 10-23-14 10-30-14\n\n##### Specifically, whether the user decides to allow the application to send the SMS can be used as a signal to indicate whether the application is behaving in a manner that matches user expectations.\n\nFor example, an SMS client that sends to a shortcode after the user intentionally inputs the\nshortcode is more likely to be approved by the user than an application that sends without first\nnotifying the user.\n\nSafetyNet aggregates data that is collected about which applications are more likely to have requests\nto send premium SMS be rejected by a user. This is used to identify Potentially Harmful Applications\nwhich are subsequently blocked by Verify Apps, or removed from Google Play.\n\n###### Other APIs of Interest\n\nIn 2014, Safety Net began to conduct small-scale experiments into methods to detect potential\nabuse of other APIs including Device Administrator, SD Card / External Storage, and telephony APIs.\n\n\n**Fraction of SMS Sent to Premium Shortcodes Blocked by User**\n\n16.00%\n\n12.00%\n\n8.00%\n\n4.00%\n\n0.0%\n\n9-16-14 9-24-14 10-1-14 10-8-14 10-15-14 10-23-14 10-30-14\n\n\n-----\n\n## Security Model Integrity\n\n##### Safety Net uses multiple different tests to determine whether a device is operating in a manner that is con- sistent with the expectations of the Android security model.\n\nFor example, starting with Android 4.4, SELinux is required to be set to Enforcing on all compatible\nAndroid devices. Safety Net began to track the status of SELinux on Android 4.4 and newer devices\nin September 2014. During the time measured in 2014, approximately 0.6% of devices had SELinux\nfully disabled and about 0.3% of devices had SELinux enabled and configured in Permissive mode.\nThese settings indicate either that the device is running a non-certified system image (e.g. a custom\nROM or one that did not pass CTS compatibility) or that the system integrity has been compromised\n(e.g. by a rooting application that subsequently disabled or reconfigured SELinux) -- in either case it\nis not a CTS-compatible Android 4.4 device.\n\n**Fraction of Android 4.4 Devices With Modified SELinux Configuration**\n\n0.80%\n\n0.60%\n\n0.40%\n\nNot Present Fraction\n\n0.20%\n\nPresent but not Enforcing Fraction\n\n0.00%\n9-17-14 9-23-14 9-29-14 10-5-14 10-10-14 10-16-14 10-22-14 10-28-14\n\n\nis not a CTS-compatible Android 4.4 device.\n\n**Fraction of Android 4.4 Devices With Modified SELinux Configuration**\n\nNot Present Fraction\nPresent but not Enforcing Fraction\n\n\n-----\n\n## Network Level Abuse\n\nIn 2013 and 2014, there was significant security community focus on attacks originating from offdevice sources, including attacks on SSL protocol and CA infrastructure. The Android Security\nTeam responded to these issues by developing multiple techniques to prevent exploitation\nincluding platform level changes, application level changes, including the release of the updateable\nSecurityProvider in Google Play Services and the release of the nogotofail testing framework. In\naddition to these protection mechanisms, Safety Net was updated to include the capability to\nmeasure attempted network exploitation.\n\n##### Safety Net currently analyzes about 400 million network connections per day to identify attacks that targeting network traffic.\n\n\n-----\n\n## SSLv3 downgrade\n\nAs part of the Android response to the disclosure of the POODLE attack, we began to actively\nmonitor downgrade of SSLv3 connections. We are currently analyzing approximately 400 million\nconnections per day to Google servers from Android devices throughout the world. Our goal is to\nmonitor for individual instances of exploitation\n\n###### So far, this research has not found\n\nas well as determine if there are broad changes\nin the prevalence of SSLv3 downgrades that that **any evidence of exploitation outside**\nmight be indicative of large scale exploitation **of research experiments, but we**\ntargeted at specific classes of devices or regions. **plan to continue the research.**\nSo far, this research has not found any evidence\nof exploitation outside of research experiments, but we plan to continue the research.

We used Safety Net to\ninstrument the patch for this vulnerability to detect attempted exploitation against clients that had\nbeen patched. As with the SSLv3 downgrade monitoring,\n\n###### Our goal is to use client\n\nour goal is to use client connections to determine whether\n\n###### connections to determine\n\nthere is evidence of large scale exploitation.

As this application has been updated to use\nthe Google Play Services SecurityProvider, these attempts were unsuccessful. While we don’t have\nvisibility into attempts at exploitation against all clients, this data suggests that there has not been\nlarge scale exploitation of this issue.\n\n\n-----\n\n## CA Man In The Middle\n\nCertificate pinning and blacklisting were introduced in Android 4.2 to provide a mechanism for\nresponding to potential compromises in the CAs that are installed by default on Android devices.\n\n##### Starting with Android 4.4 and greater, Android began to display a warning to users if a certificate was installed locally on the device that could allow interception of SSL traffic.\n\nStarting in October 2014, Safety Net has used active network probes to identify cases where the CA\nsystem is manipulated. Safety Net detected several hundred instances each day where users have\ninstalled a local certificate to Man-in-the-Middle network connections to Google services. We have\nseen a small number of instances of devices that have been compromised and had a certificate\ninstalled into the system CA (this avoids the security warning to users). All instances that we have\nseen appear to be part of “enterprise” security efforts. At this time, we have not detected any MiTM\nefforts that we would classify as “malicious”.\n\n**Observed Instances of Local MiTM of Google Services**\n\n400\n\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\n0\n\n10-1-14 10-4-14 10-8-14 10-12-14 10-15-14 10-19-14 10-23-14 10-26-14 10-30-14\n\n\n400\n\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\n0\n\n10-1-14 10-4-14 10-8-14 10-12-14 10-15-14 10-19-14 10-23-14 10-26-14 10-30-14\n\n\nwww.google.com In System Store\n\nwww.google.com User Added\n\n\naccounts.google.com In System Store\n\naccounts.google.com User Added\n\n\n-----\n\n## Safe Browsing Statistics\n\nIn 2014, Safe Browsing was enabled for Google Chrome on Android when using network\ncompression.

As noted previously, there are likely to be some attempted exploitations that are not\ndetected by SafeBrowsing but so far widespread attempted exploitation of browser vulnerabilities\nhas not been observed.\n\n\n-----",
