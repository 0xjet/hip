We also discovered two previously unknown payloads. These payloads contained backdoors that we have named\nBYEBY and PYLOT respectively.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1 Diagram of the attack sequence_\n\n## Phishing Emails\n\nBetween June and August of this year, we observed a total of 20 unique emails being sent to the following email addresses:\n\n**Email Address** **Description**\n\npress@mod.mil[.]by Press Service of the Ministry of Defense of the Republic of Belarus\n\nbaranovichi_eu@mod.mil[.]by Baranovichi Operational Management of the Armed Forces\n\nmodmail@mod.mil[.]by Ministry of Defense of the Republic of Belarus\n\nadmin@mod.mil[.]by Ministry of Defense of the Republic of Belarus\n\nitsc@mod.mil[.]by Unknown.

Likely used by the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Belarus\n\n[These emails contained a series of subject lines, primarily revolving around the topic of Запад-2017 (‘West-2017’), also known in English as](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%97%D0%B0%D0%BF%D0%B0%D0%B4-2017)\n[Zapad 2017. Zapad 2017 was a series of joint military exercises conducted by the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation and the Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zapad_2017_exercise)\nof Belarus, held from September 14th to 20th in 2017.\n\nThe full list of subject lines is as follows:\n\nFwd:Подготовка к Запад-2017 [Translation: Fwd:Preparing for the West-2017]\nвыпуск воспитанников [Translation: graduation]\nК Запад-2017 [Translation: To West-2017]\nЗапад-2017 [Translation: West-2017]\n\nAn example of some of the previously mentioned emails may be seen below.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2 Phishing email sent to Belarus government (1/2)_\n\n_Figure 3 Phishing email sent to Belarus government (2/2)_\n\n## Decoy Documents\n\n\n-----\n\ne obse ed t at t e attac e ts used t ese e a s co ta ed a tu e o e types docu e ts, c oso t o d docu e ts, a d a\nRAR archive. The RAR archive contained a series of images, a decoy document, and a Microsoft Windows executable within it. The\nexecutable has a .scr file extension, and is designed to look like a Windows folder, as seen below:\n\n_Figure 4 Payload disguising itself as a Microsoft Windows folder_\n\nThe rough translation of the folder and file names above are ‘Preparations for large-scale West-2017 exercises in this format are being held for\nthe first time.’ Within the actual folder, there are a series of JPG images, as well as a decoy document with a title that is translated to\n‘Thousands of Russian and Belarusian military are involved in the training of the rear services.’\n\n_Figure 5 Embedded images and decoy document within RAR_\n\nThe decoy document contains the following content:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6 Decoy document within RAR_\n\nThe other RTF and Word documents used additional decoy documents, which can be seen below.\n\n_Figure 7 Decoy document with translation (1/2)_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8 Decoy document with translation (2/2)_\n\nWhile we observed different techniques being used for delivery, all attachments executed a variant of the CMSTAR malware family. We\nobserved minor changes between variants, which we discuss in the CMSTAR Variations and Payloads section of the blog post.\n\nThe Word documents, which we track as Werow, employ malicious macros for their delivery. More information about these macros may be\nfound in the Appendix of the blog post. Additionally, we have included a script that extracts these embedded payloads that can also be found in\nthe Appendix.\n\n[The RTF documents made use of CVE-2015-1641. This vulnerability, patched in 2015, allows attackers to execute malicious code when these](https://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-1641)\nspecially crafted documents are opened within vulnerable instances of Microsoft Word. The payload for these samples is embedded within\nthem and obfuscated using a 4-byte XOR key of 0xCAFEBABE. We have included a script that can be used to extract the underlying payload\nof these RTFs statically that can be found in the Appendix.\n\nThe SCR file mentioned previously drops a CMSTAR DLL and runs it via an external call to rundll32.exe.\n\n## CMSTAR Variations and Payloads\n\nIn total, we observed three variations of CMSTAR in these recent attacks against Belarusian targets. The biggest change observed between\nthem looks to be minor modifications made to the string obfuscation routine. A very simple modification to the digit used in subtraction was\nmodified between the variants, as shown below:\n\n_Figure 9 String obfuscation modifications between CMSTAR variants_\n\n\n-----\n\ne o de a at o, a ed C S, as d scussed a p e ous b og post e t t ed, g ta Qua te aste Sce a o e o st ated\nAttacks Against the Mongolian Government.”\n\nThe CMSTAR.B variant was witnessed using both a different mutex from CMSTAR.A, as well as a slightly modified string obfuscation routine.\nThe mutexes used by CMSTAR ensure that only one instance of the malware runs at a time. The CMSTAR.C variant used the same mutex as\nCMSTAR.B, however, again used another slightly modified string obfuscation routine. We found all CMSTAR variants using the same\nobfuscation routine when I payload was downloaded from a remote server. We have included a tool to extract mutex and C2 information from\nall three CMSTAR variants, as well as a tool to decode the downloaded payload: both may be found in the Scripts section.\n\nAn example of CMSTAR downloading its payload may be found below:\n\n_Figure 10 Example HTTP download by CMSTAR_\n\nWhen expanding the research to identify additional CMSTAR.B and CMSTAR.C variants, we identified a total of 31 samples. Of these 31\nsamples, we found two unique payloads served from three of the C2 URLS—One of which was downloaded from a sample found in the\nphishing attacks previously described. Both payloads contained previously unknown malware families. We have named the payload found in\nthe email campaign PYLOT, and the malware downloaded from the additional CMSTAR samples BYEBY.\n\nBoth malware families acted as backdoors, allowing the attackers to execute commands on the victim machine, as well as a series of other\nfunctions. More information about these individual malware families may be found in the appendix.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nDuring the course of this research, we identified a phishing campaign consisting of 20 unique emails targeting the government of Belarus. The\nploys used in these email and decoy documents revolved around a joint strategic military exercise of the Armed Forces of the Russian\nFederation and the Republic of Belarus, which took place between September 14 and September 20 of this year. While looking at theth th\nemails in question, we observed two new variants of the CMSTAR malware family. Between the samples identified and others we found while\nexpanding our research scope, we identified two previously unknown malware families.\n\nPalo Alto customers are protected from this threat in the following ways:\n\n[Tags have been created in AutoFocus to track CMSTAR,](https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.Cmstar) [BYEBY, and](https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.BYEBY) [PYLOT](https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.PYLOT)\nAll observed samples are identified as malicious in WildFire\nDomains observed to act as C2s have been flagged as malicious\nTraps 4.1 identifies and blocks the CVE-2015-1641 exploit used in these documents\nTraps 4.1 blocks the macros used in the malicious Word documents\n\nA special thanks to Tom Lancaster for his assistance on this research.\n\n## Appendix\n\n### Werow Macro Analysis\n\nThe attacker used the same macro dropper all of the observed Microsoft Word documents we analyzed for this campaign. It begins by building\nthe following path strings:\n\n%APPDATA%\\d.doc\n%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Office\\WinCred.acl\n\nThe ‘d.doc’ path will be used to store a copy of the Word document, while the ‘WinCred.acl’ will contain the dropped payload, which is\nexpected to be a DLL.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 11 Macro used to drop CMSTAR_\n\n\n-----\n\ne o uses ud e ta y ob uscat o to de a d e asse b e t e o o g st gs\n\nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\WinCred\nrundll32 %APPDATA%\\Microsof\\Office\\WinCred.acl,WinCred\n\nThese strings will be used at the end of the macro’s execution to ensure persistence via the Run registry key.\n\nThe malware proceeds to read an included overlay within the original Word document from a given offset. This data is decoded using and XOR\noperation, as well as an addition operation. It can be represented in Python as follows:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n\n\ndef decrypt_xor(data, key, key_offset):\noutput = \"\"\nseed = ord(key)\nfor d in data:\nord_d = ord(d)\nif ord_d != 0 and ord_d != seed:\nnvalue = ord_d ^ seed\nseed = (seed + key_offset) % 0x100\noutput += chr(nvalue)\nelse:\noutput += d\nreturn output\n\n\nOnce this overlay is decoded, it is written to the ‘WinCred.acl’ file and loaded with the ‘WinCred’ export. A script has been provided in the\nScripts section that, in conjunction with oletools, can statically extract the embedded DLL payload from these documents.\n\n### RTF Shellcode Analysis\n\nThe RTF documents delivered in this attack campaign appear to be created by the same builder. All of the RTF files attempt to exploit CVE2015-1641 to execute shellcode on the targeted system. Please reference https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/ms15-033.aspx\nfor more information.\n\nThe shellcode executed after successful exploitation begins by resolving the API functions it requires by enumerating the API functions within\nloaded modules in the current process. It then builds the following list of values:\n\nThe shellcode then enumerates the API functions, subjects them to a ROR7 hashing routine and XORs the resulting hash with 0x10ADBEEF.\nIt uses the result of this arithmetic to compare with the list of values above to find the API functions it requires to carry out its functionality.\n\n**ROR7** **ROR7^0x10ADBEEF** **API Func**\n\n1a22f51 110f91be WinExec\n\n741f8dc4 64b2332b WriteFile\n\n94e43293 84498c7c CreateFileA\n\ndaa7fe52 ca0a40bd UnmapViewOfFile\n\ndbacbe43 cb0100ac SetFilePointer\n\nec496a9e fce4d471 GetEnvironmentVariableA\n\nff0d6657 efa0d8b8 CloseHandle\n\nAfter resolving the API functions, the shellcode then begins searching for the embedded payload and decoy within the initial RTF file. It does\nso by searching the RTF file for three delimiters, specifically 0xBABABABABABA, 0xBBBBBBBB and 0xBCBCBCBC, which the shellcode\nuses to find the encrypted payload and decoy. The shellcode then decrypts the payload by XOR'ing four bytes at at time with the key\n0xCAFEBABE, and decrypts the decoy by XOR'ing four bytes at a time using the key 0xBAADF00D. Here is a visual representation of the\ndelimiters and embedded files:\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter decrypting the payload, it saves the file to the following location:\n\n%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Office\\OutL12.pip\n\nThe shellcode then creates the following registry key to automatically run the payload each time the system starts:\n\nSoftware\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run : Microsoft\n\nThe shellcode saves the following command to this autorun key, which will execute the OutL12.pip payload, specifically calling its 'WinCred'\nexported function:\n\nrundll32.exe\n\n\"%APPDATA\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Office\\OutL12.pip\",WinCred\n\nThe shellcode will then overwrite the original delivery document with the decrypted decoy contents and open the new document.\n\n### PYLOT Analysis\n\nThis malware family was named via a combination of the DLLs original name of ‘pilot.dll’, along with the fact it downloads files with a Python\n(.py) file extension.\n\nPYLOT begins by being loaded as a DLL with the ServiceMain export. It proceeds to create the following two folders within the %TEMP% path:\n\nKB287640\nKB887209\n\nPYLOT continues to load and decode an embedded resource file. This file contains configuration information that is used by the malware\nthroughout its execution. The following script, written in Python, may be used to decode this embedded resource object:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n\n\nimport sys\nimport hexdump\n\nfile = sys.argv[1]\nfh = open(file, 'rb')\nfdata = list(fh.read())\nfh.close()\n\nfdata_len = len(fdata)\nc = fdata_len-1\n\noutput = \"\"\nwhile c &gt; 1:\nfdata[c] = chr( ord(fdata[c]) ^ ord(fdata[c-2]) )\nc -= 1\n\nfdata = ''.join(fdata)\nhexdump.hexdump(fdata)\n\n\nLooking at the decoded data, we see the following:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 12 Decoded embedded configuration information_\n\nThe malware continues to collect the following information from the victim computer:\n\nComputer name\nIP addresses present on the machine\nMAC addresses\nMicrosoft Windows version information\nWindows code page identifier information\n\nThis information is used to generate a unique hash for the victim machine. PYLOT then begins entering its C2 handler routine, where it will use\nHTTP for communication with the remote host.\n\nData sent to the remote C2 server is encrypted using RC4 with the previously shown key of ‘BBidRotnqQpHfpRTi8cR.’ It is then further\nobfuscated by base64-encoding this encrypted string. An example of this HTTP request containing this data can be seen below.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 13 HTTP request made by PYLOT to remote server_\n\nThe decrypted data sent in the request above is as follows. Note that all of this custom data format has not been fully identified, however, we’re\nable to see various strings, including the embedded configuration string of ‘fGAka0001’, as well as the victim hash of ‘100048048.’\n\n_Figure 14 Decrypted data sent by PYLOT to remote server_\n\nThe base64-encoded string at the end of the data contains the collected victim machine information from earlier, separated by a ‘|’ delimiter.\n\nThe remote C2 server responds using the same data format. An example response can be seen below.\n\n_Figure 15 Response from remote C2 server_\n\nThe decoded data at the end of the response contains various URIs to be used by the malware to receive commands, as well as other\ninformation that has yet to be fully researched.\n\n\n-----\n\n1 /duakzu/furs.py|/ugvrf/pvoi.py|/tydfw/pld.py|/bpnij/syau.py|/plugin/plugin.py|eycHhHKVQUnuAwtNchvYjScGYMtVMzMqYmxBmCEwieQpKgsok\n\nA number of commands have been identified within PYLOT, including the following:\n\n- Download batch script\n\n- Run batch script\n\n- Delete file\n\n- Rename file\n\n- Execute file\n\n- Download file\n\n- Upload file\n\n### BYEBY Analysis\n\nBYEBY was named based on a string within the malware itself. Most strings found within this malware are concatenated to 6 characters. One\nsuch example was an instance where a debug string contained ‘BYE BY’, which was likely a concatenated form of the phrase ‘BYE BYE’.\n\nThis malware is loaded as a DLL, with an export name of ServiceMain. When the malware is initially loaded, it begins by checking to see if it is\nrunning within either of the following paths:\n\n[SYSTEM32]\\svchost.exe\n\n[SYSTEM32]\\rundll32.exe\n\nIf it finds itself not running in either location, it will immediately exit. This is likely a technique used to bypass various sandboxing systems.\nShould it find itself running as svchost.exe, it will write the current timestamp and a value of ‘V09SS010’ (Base64 Decoded: ‘WORKMN’) to a\nfile named ‘vmunisvc.cab’ within the user’s local %TEMP% folder. This file acts as a lot file and is written to frequently throughout the\nmalware’s execution.\n\nWhen the malware runs within the context of svchost.exe, it bypasses the installation routines and immediately enters the C2 handler.\n\nWhen BYEBY is run within the context of rundll32.exe, it expects itself to be running for the first time. As such, it will register itself as a service\nwith a name of ‘VideoSrv.’ After this service is created, BYEBY proceeds to enter it’s C2 handler function in a new thread.\n\nBYEBY uses TLS for network communication, connecting to the following host on port 443:\n\noeiowidfla22[.]com\n\nAfter the initial connection is established, BYEBY will collect the following system information and upload it to the remote C2:\n\nHostname\nIP Address\nEmbedded String of 'WinVideo'\nMajor Windows Version\nMinor Windows Version\nEmbedded String of '6.1.7603.16000'\n\nThe malware is configured to accept a number of commands. These appear to be Base64-encoded strings that, when decoded, provide their\ntrue meaning. Only the beginning of the commands are checked. The Base64-decoded strings have been included for the benefit of the\nreader.\n\naGVsbG8h [Decoded: hello!]\nR09PREJZ [Decoded: GOODBY]\nTElTVCBE [Decoded: LIST D]\nU1RBUlRD [Decoded: STARTC]\nQ09NTUFO [Decoded: COMMAN]\nVFJBTlNG [Decoded: TRANSF]\nRVhFQ1VU [Decoded: EXECUT]\n\nA mapping of commands and their descriptions has been provided:\n\n**Command** **Description**\n\naGVsbG8h Authenticate with the remote C2 server.\n\nR09PREJZ Close socket connection with remote server.\n\nTElTVCBE List drives on the victim machine.\n\nU1RBUlRD Start an interactive shell on the victim machine.\n\n\n-----\n\nQ09NTUFO Execute a command in the interactive shell\n\nVFJBTlNG Upload or download files to the victim machine.\n\nRVhFQ1VU Execute command in a new process.\n\n### Scripts\n\nWe created multiple scripts during the course of our research.
