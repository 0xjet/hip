See Advisory.](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa22-335a)_\n\n### Summary\n\nThe threat actor known as RomCom is running a series of new attack campaigns that take advantage of\nthe brand power of SolarWinds, KeePass, and PDF Technologies. The BlackBerry Threat Research and\nIntelligence Team uncovered the campaigns while analyzing network artifacts unearthed during our recent\n[report on RomComRAT, which was targeting Ukrainian military institutions through spoofed versions of](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2022/10/unattributed-romcom-threat-actor-spoofing-popular-apps-now-hits-ukrainian-militaries)\nAdvanced IP Scanner software.\n\nIn our latest discovery, our team found RomCom impersonating the following products in their campaigns:\n**SolarWinds Network Performance Monitor, KeePass Open-Source Password Manager, and PDF**\n**Reader Pro.**\n\nWhile Ukraine still appears to be the primary target of this campaign, we believe some English-speaking\ncountries are being targeted as well, including the United Kingdom. This is based on the terms of service\n(TOS) of two of the malicious websites and the SSL certificates of a newly created command-and-control\n(C2).\n\n\n-----\n\nGiven the geography of the targets and the current geopolitical situation, it s unlikely that the RomCom\nRAT threat actor is cybercrime-motivated.\n\n### Attack Vector\n\nIn preparation for an attack, the RomCom threat actor performs the following simplified scheme: scraping\nthe original legitimate HTML code from the vendor to spoof, registering a malicious domain similar to the\nlegitimate one, Trojanizing a legitimate application, uploading a malicious bundle to the decoy website,\ndeploying targeted phishing emails to the victims, or in some instances, using additional infector vectors,\nwhich we will go into in more detail below.\n\n### RomCom Weaponization\n\n**RomCom SolarWinds Network Performance Monitor Campaign**\n\nTake a look at the two screen shots below to see how the real SolarWinds NPM site and the spoofed site\ncompare.\n\nFigure 1 – Legitimate SolarWinds website\n\n_Figure 2 – Fake SolarWinds website_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe deployment of this attack is through a Trojanized version of the SolarWinds Network Performance\nMonitoring (NPM) application. While downloading a free trial from the spoofed SolarWinds site, a\n_legitimate registration form appears. If filled out, real SolarWinds sales personnel might contact the victim_\nto follow up on the product trial. That technique misleads the victim into believing that the recently\ndownloaded and installed application is completely legitimate. Instead, the victim has unknowingly\ndownloaded a dropper for the malicious RomCom remote access Trojan (RAT).\n\n**Hashes (md5, sha-256)** 7c003b4f8b3c0ab0c3f8cb933e93d301\n\n246dfe16a9248d7fb90993f6f28b0ebe87964ffd2dcdb13105096cde025ca614\n\n**File Name** Solarwinds-Orion-NPM-Eval.zip\n\n**File Size** 124,671,897 bytes\n\n_Figure 3 – Extracted contents of \"SolarWinds-Orion-NPM-Eval.zip\"_\n\nThe “Solarwinds-Orion-NPM-Eval.exe” file contains a digital certificate from “Wechapaisch Consulting &\nConstruction Limited.” The threat actor previously used the same certificate information in the\n“advancedipscanner.msi” file, a detail which we uncovered in our previous investigation into this threat\nactor. It is important to note that the legitimate file is digitally signed by “SolarWinds Worldwide, LLC.”\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Solarwinds-Orion-NPM-Eval.exe contains three embedded x64 files in the resource section:\n\n**X86 – Contains “c:\\users\\123\\source\\repos\\ins_asi\\win32\\release\\instlib.pdb,” the same PDB path**\nwe have previously seen in the “setup.exe” files.\n**X87 – A clean, digitally signed, SolarWinds Orion installer.**\n**X88 – RomCom RAT dropper. This DLL invokes “rundll32.exe” and runs the “fwdTst” export, which**\ndrops x64 RomCom RAT in “C:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\winver.dll” location.\n\n\n**Hashes (md5,**\n**sha-256)**\n\n\n4E4ECA58B896BDB6DB260F21EDC7760A\n\nABE9635ADBFEE2D2FBAEA140625C49ABE3BAA29C44FB53A65A9CDA02121583EE\n\n\n**ITW File Name** combase32.dll, winver.dll\n\n\n**Compilation**\n**Stamp**\n\n**File**\n**Type/Signature**\n\n\nTue Aug 02 16:20:43 2022\n\nPE 64 DLL\n\n\n**File Size** 623616 bytes\n\n\n**Compiler**\n**Name/Version**\n\n\nMicrosoft Visual C++\n\n\n**C2** combinedresidency[.]org\n\n### KeePass RomCom Campaign\n\nOn Nov. 1, the BlackBerry Threat Research and Intelligence Team made another discovery. The RomCom\nteam created a new attack campaign abusing a popular password keeper called KeePass. When\nsomeone downloads the application from the fake but legitimate-looking KeePass website, the attacker\ndrops a malicious bundle onto the victim’s machine with the name \"KeePass-2.52.\"\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4 – Legitimate KeePass website_\n\n_Figure 5 – Fake KeePass website_\n\nThe fake KeePass.org website drops a Trojanized bundle called \"KeePass-2.52.zip.\" Once unpacked, it\ncontains the following files:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6 –_ _Contents of the malicious archive_\n\nAs shown in the screenshot above, two malicious files are contained in the KeePass-2.52.zip file:\n\n**Setup.exe – The file that launches the RomCom RAT dropper: PDB**\nC:\\Users\\123\\source\\repos\\ins_asi\\Win32\\Release\\setup.pdb\n**hlpr.dat is a RomCom RAT dropper.**\n\nOur team followed the RomCom Netflows and uncovered both spoofed KeePass and PDF Reader Pro\nsites in Ukrainian language. Both of these spoofed websites host their terms of service pages on the same\nURL and imply the software providers are hosted by UK companies.\n\nhref=\"privacy/uk_privacy.html\"\n\nhref=\"privacy/uk_term.html\"\n\nhref=\"privacy/uk_disclaimer.html\"\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7 – KeePass spoofed website in Ukrainian_\n\n_Figure 8 – PDF Reader Pro spoofed website in Ukrainian_\n\nNetflow analysis by the BlackBerry Research and Intelligence Team also led to the discovery of a new C2\nregistered on Oct. 27, utilizing SSL certificates that emulate UK ownership:\n\nIssuer: C=GB, ST=Greater London, L=Harmondsworth, O=British Government, OU=dgtlocean.com,\nCN=ca dgtlocean.com/emailAddress=ca(at)mail.com Issuer: C=GB, ST=Greater London, L=London,\nO=Government Digital Service, OU=you-supported.com, CN=ca you-supported.com/em\n\ndepth=0 C = GB, ST = British, L = Chesterfield, O = Royal Mail Group Ltd, OU = Group1, CN = Group1.A,\nemailAddress = server(at)mail.com\n\n### Conclusions\n\nThe RomCom threat actor is actively deploying new campaigns targeting victims in Ukraine and Englishspeaking targets worldwide. Based on the TOS, it is possible that victims in the United Kingdom are a new\ntarget, while Ukraine continues to be the main focus.\n\nIt’s important to note:\n\nThe Trojanized bundles that the threat actor built do not indicate the mentioned vendors were\ncompromised\nThe legitimate companies are not involved in any attack\nThe threat actors created fake websites to mimic the real ones\n\n\n-----\n\nRomCom RAT, [Cuba Ransomware, and](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2021/04/threat-thursday-blackberry-protect-vs-cuba-ransomware) [Industrial Spy have an apparent connection. Industrial Spy is a](https://www.msspalert.com/cybersecurity-breaches-and-attacks/ransomware/new-ransomware-family-industrial-spy-emerges-to-exfiltrate-data-extort-victims/)\nrelatively new ransomware group that emerged in April 2022. However, given the targets' geography and\ncharacteristics, combined with the current geopolitical situation, it's unclear if the real motivation of the\nRomCom threat actor is purely cybercriminal in nature.\n\n### RomCom RAT Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)\n\n\n**Filename**\n\n**MD5**\n\n**SHA256**\n\n**Filename**\n\n**MD5**\n\n**SHA256**\n\n**Filename**\n\n**MD5**\n\n**SHA256**\n\n**Type**\n\n**MD5**\n\n**SHA256**\n\n**MD5**\n\n**SHA256**\n\n**Type**\n\n**MD5**\n\n**SHA256**\n\n**MD5**\n\n**SHA256**\n\n\n**Solarwinds-Orion-NPM-Eval.zip**\n\n7C003B4F8B3C0AB0C3F8CB933E93D301\n\n246DFE16A9248D7FB90993F6F28B0EBE87964FFD2DCDB13105096CDE025CA614\n\n**KeePass-2.52.zip**\n\n1a21a1e626fd342e794bcc3b06981d2c\n\n596eaef93bdcd00a3aedaf6ad6d46db4429eeba61219b7e01b1781ebbf6e321b\n\n**Solarwinds-Orion-NPM-Eval.exe**\n\nD1A84706767BFB802632A262912E95A8\n\n9D3B268416D3FAB4322CC916D32E0B2E8FA0DE370ACD686873D1522306124FD2\n\n**RomCom RAT Dropper**\n\nCB933F1C913144A8CA6CFCFD913D6D28\n\nAC09CBFEE4CF89D7B7A755C387E473249684F18AA699EB651D119D19E25BFF34\n\n8284421bbb94f3c37f94899cdcd19afd\n\n8b8dff5d30802fd79b76ee1531e7d050184a07570201ef1cd83a7bb8fa627cb0\n\n**RomCom RAT Launcher (Setup.exe)**\n\n6310A2063687800559AE9D65CFF21B0A\n\nF7013CE417FCBA0F36C4B9BF5F8F6E0E2B14D6ED33FF4D384C892773508E932E\n\n550f42c5b555893d171285dc8b15b4b5\n\n5f187393acdeb67e76126353c74b6080d3e6ccf28ae580658c670d8b6e4aacc1\n\n\n-----\n\n**Type**\n\n**MD5**\n\n**SHA256**\n\n**MD5**\n\n**SHA256**\n\n\n**RomCom RAT Payload**\n\n4E4ECA58B896BDB6DB260F21EDC7760A\n\nABE9635ADBFEE2D2FBAEA140625C49ABE3BAA29C44FB53A65A9CDA02121583EE\n\na7172aef66bb12e1bb40a557bb41e607\n\n3252965013ec861567510d54a97446610edba5da88648466de6b3145266386d9\n\n\n**You might also be interested in:**\n\n## About The BlackBerry Research & Intelligence Team\n\nThe BlackBerry Research & Intelligence team examines emerging and persistent threats, providing\nintelligence analysis for the benefit of defenders and the organizations they serve.\n\nBack\n\n\n-----",
