GTsSS actors have collected victim credentials by sending\nspearphishing emails that appear to be legitimate security alerts from the victim’s email provider and\ninclude hyperlinks leading to spoofed popular webmail services’ logon pages. GTsSS actors have\nalso registered domains to conduct credential harvesting operations. These domains mimic popular\ninternational social media platforms and masquerade as tourism- and sports-related entities and\nmusic and video streaming services.\n\n**High-Profile Activity: the U.S. Government assesses that GTsSS cyber actors have deployed**\n[Drovorub malware against victim devices as part of their cyber espionage operations.[16] The U.S.](https://media.defense.gov/2020/Aug/13/2002476465/-1/-1/0/CSA_DROVORUB_RUSSIAN_GRU_MALWARE_AUG_2020.PDF)\nGovernment and UK Government assess that GTsSS actors used a Kubernetes[®] cluster to conduct\nwidespread, distributed, and anonymized brute force access attempts against hundreds of\n[government and private sector targets worldwide.[17]](https://media.defense.gov/2021/Jul/01/2002753896/-1/-1/1/CSA_GRU_GLOBAL_BRUTE_FORCE_CAMPAIGN_UOO158036-21.PDF)\n\n**Also known as: APT28, FANCY BEAR, Group 74, IRON TWILIGHT, PawnStorm, Sednit,**\nSNAKEMACKEREL, Sofacy, STRONTIUM, Swallowtail, TG-4127, Threat Group-4127, and Tsar\n[Team [18]](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/groups/G0007/)\n\n**[Resources: for more information on GTsSS, see the MITRE ATT&CK webpage on APT28.](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/groups/G0007/)**\n\n#### GRU’s Main Center of Special Technologies\n\n**Overview: GTsST, or Unit 74455, is an APT group that has operated since at least 2009 and has**\ntargeted a variety of critical infrastructure organizations, including those in the Energy, Transportation\nSystems, and Financial Services Sectors.

These groups pose consistent threats to critical infrastructure\norganizations globally.\n\nSince Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, some cybercrime groups have independently\npublicly pledged support for the Russian government or the Russian people and/or threatened to\nconduct cyber operations to retaliate against perceived attacks against Russia or materiel support for\nUkraine. These Russian-aligned cybercrime groups likely pose a threat to critical infrastructure\norganizations primarily through:\n\n     - Deploying ransomware through which cyber actors remove victim access to data (usually via\nencryption), potentially causing significant disruption to operations.\n\n     - Conducting DDoS attacks against websites.\n```\n        o In a DDoS attack, the cyber actor generates enough requests to flood and overload the\n\n```\ntarget page and stop it from responding.\n```\n        o DDoS attacks are often accompanied by extortion. \n        o According to industry reporting, some cybercrime groups have recently carried out\n\n```\nDDoS attacks against Ukrainian defense organizations, and one group claimed credit\nfor DDoS attack against a U.S. airport the actors perceived as supporting Ukraine (see\nthe Killnet section).\n\nBased on industry and open-source reporting, U.S., Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, and UK\ncyber authorities assess multiple Russian-aligned cybercrime groups pose a threat to critical\ninfrastructure organizations. These groups include:\n\n     - **The CoomingProject**\n\n     - **Killnet**\n\n     - **MUMMY SPIDER**\n\n     - **SALTY SPIDER**\n\n     - **SCULLY SPIDER**\n\n     - **SMOKEY SPIDER**\n\n     - **WIZARD SPIDER**\n\n     - **The Xaknet Team**\n\n**Note: although some cybercrime groups may conduct cyber operations in support of the Russian**\ngovernment, U.S., Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, and UK cyber authorities assess that cyber\ncriminals will most likely continue to operate primarily based on financial motivations, which may\ninclude targeting government and critical infrastructure organizations.\n\n#### The CoomingProject\n\n**Overview: the CoomingProject is a criminal group that extorts money from victims by exposing or**\n[threatening to expose leaked data.

Emotet is advanced, modular malware that originated as a banking trojan (malware designed\nto steal information from banking systems but that may also be used to drop additional malware and\nransomware). Today Emotet primarily functions as a downloader and distribution service for other\ncybercrime groups. Emotet has been used to deploy WIZARD SPIDER’s TrickBot, which is often a\nprecursor to ransomware delivery. Emotet has worm-like features that enable rapid spreading in an\ninfected network.\n\n**Victims: according to open sources, Emotet has been used to target industries worldwide, including**\nfinancial, e-commerce, healthcare, academia, government, and technology organizations’ networks.\n\n**Also known as: Gold Crestwood, TA542, TEMP.Mixmaster, UNC3443**\n\n**[Resources: for more information on Emotet, see joint Alert Emotet Malware.

Sality**\nis a polymorphic file infector that was discovered in 2003; since then, it has been replaced by more\n[advanced peer-to-peer (P2P) malware loaders.[35]](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/who-is-salty-spider/)\n\n**Victims: according to industry reporting, in February 2022, SALTY SPIDER conducted DDoS attacks**\nagainst Ukrainian web forums used to discuss events relating to Russia’s military offensive against\nthe city of Kharkiv.\n\n**Also known as: Sality**\n\n#### SCULLY SPIDER\n\n**Overview: SCULLY SPIDER is a cybercrime group that operates using a malware-as-a-service**\nmodel; SCULLY SPIDER maintains command and control infrastructure and sells access to their\n[malware and infrastructure to affiliates, who distribute their own malware.[36][37] SCULLY SPIDER](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/new-year-new-version-danabot)\ndevelops and operates the DanaBot botnet, which originated primarily as a banking Trojan but\nexpanded beyond banking in 2021 and has since been used to facilitate access for other types of\nmalware, including TrickBot, DoppelDridex, and Zloader. Like Emotet, Danabot effectively functions\nas an initial access vector for other malware, which can result in ransomware deployment.\n\n\n**TLP:WHITE** Product ID: AA22-110A\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:WHITE** Product ID: AA22-110A\n\nAccording to industry reporting, recent DDoS activity by the DanaBot botnet suggests SCULLY\nSPIDER has operated in support of Russia’s military offensive in Ukraine.\n\n**Victims: SCULLY SPIDER affiliates have primarily targeted organizations in the United States,**\n[Canada, Germany, United Kingdom, Australia, Italy, Poland, Mexico, and Ukraine.[38] According to](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/new-year-new-version-danabot)\nindustry reporting, in March 2022, Danabot was used in DDoS attacks against multiple Ukrainian\ngovernment organizations.\n\n**Also known as: Gold Opera**\n\n#### SMOKEY SPIDER\n\n**Overview: SMOKEY SPIDER is a cybercrime group that develops Smoke Loader (also known as**\nSmoke Bot), a malicious bot that is used to upload other malware. Smoke Loader has been available\nsince at least 2011, and operates as a malware distribution service for a number of different payloads,\nincluding—but not limited to—DanaBot, TrickBot, and Qakbot.\n\n**Victims: according to industry reporting, Smoke Loader was observed in March 2022 distributing**\nDanaBot payloads that were subsequently used in DDoS attacks against Ukrainian targets.\n\n**[Resources: for more information on Smoke Loader, see the MITRE ATT&CK webpage on Smoke](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/software/S0226/)**\n[Loader.](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/software/S0226/)\n\n#### WIZARD SPIDER\n\n**Overview: WIZARD SPIDER is a cybercrime group that develops TrickBot malware and Conti**\nransomware. Historically, the group has paid a wage to the ransomware deployers (referred to as\naffiliates), some of whom may then receive a share of the proceeds from a successful ransomware\nattack. In addition to TrickBot, notable initial access and persistence vectors for affiliated actors\ninclude Emotet, Cobalt Strike, spearphishing, and stolen or weak Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)\ncredentials.\n\nAfter obtaining access, WIZARD SPIDER affiliated actors have relied on various publicly available\nand otherwise legitimate tools to facilitate earlier stages of the attack lifecycle before deploying Conti\nransomware.\n\nWIZARD SPIDER pledged support to the Russian government and threatened critical infrastructure\norganizations of countries perceived to carry out cyberattacks or war against the Russian\n[government.[39] They later revised this pledge and threatened to retaliate against perceived attacks](https://therecord.media/russia-or-ukraine-hacking-groups-take-sides/)\n[against the Russian people.[40]](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/news/252513982/Conti-ransomware-gang-backs-Russia-threatens-US)\n\n**Victims: Conti victim organizations span across multiple industries, including construction and**\nengineering, legal and professional services, manufacturing, and retail. In addition, WIZARD SPIDER\n[affiliates have deployed Conti ransomware against U.S. healthcare and first responder networks.](https://www.ic3.gov/Media/News/2021/210521.pdf)\n\n**Also known as: UNC2727, Gold Ulrick**\n\n**[Resources: for more information on Conti, see joint CSA Conti Ransomware.

The leak was accompanied by a political statement criticizing the\nUkrainian government, suggesting the leak was politically motivated.\n\n## MITIGATIONS\n\nU.S., Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, and UK cyber authorities urge critical infrastructure\norganizations to prepare for and mitigate potential cyber threats by immediately (1) updating software,\n(2) enforcing MFA, (3) securing and monitoring RDP and other potentially risky services, and (4)\nproviding end-user awareness and training.\n\n     - **Update software, including operating systems, applications, and firmware, on IT**\n**network assets. Prioritize patching** [known exploited vulnerabilities](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog) and critical and high\nvulnerabilities that allow for remote code execution or denial-of-service on internet-facing\nequipment.\n```\n        o Consider using a centralized patch management system. For OT networks, use a risk\n```\nbased assessment strategy to determine the OT network assets and zones that should\nparticipate in the patch management program.\n```\n        o Consider signing up for CISA’s cyber hygiene services, including vulnerability\n\n```\nscanning, to help reduce exposure to threats. CISA’s vulnerability scanning service\nevaluates external network presence by executing continuous scans of public, static IP\naddresses for accessible services and vulnerabilities.\n\n     - **Enforce MFA to the greatest extent possible and require accounts with password**\n**[logins, including service accounts, to have strong](https://www.cisa.gov/tips/st04-002)** **passwords. Do not allow passwords to**\nbe used across multiple accounts or stored on a system to which an adversary may have\naccess. As Russian state-sponsored APT actors have demonstrated the ability to exploit\ndefault MFA protocols and known vulnerabilities, organizations should review configuration\npolicies to protect against “fail open” and re-enrollment scenarios. For more information, see\n[joint CSA Russian State-Sponsored Cyber Actors Gain Network Access by Exploiting Default](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa22-074a)\n[Multifactor Authentication Protocols and “PrintNightmare” Vulnerability.](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa22-074a)\n\n     - **If you use RDP and/or other potentially risky services, secure and monitor them**\n**closely. RDP exploitation is one of the top initial infection vectors for ransomware, and risky**\n\n\n**TLP:WHITE** Product ID: AA22-110A\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:WHITE** Product ID: AA22-110A\n\nservices, including RDP, can allow unauthorized access to your session using an on-path\nattacker.\n```\n        o Limit access to resources over internal networks, especially by restricting RDP and\n\n```\nusing virtual desktop infrastructure. After assessing risks, if RDP is deemed\noperationally necessary, restrict the originating sources and require MFA to mitigate\ncredential theft and reuse. If RDP must be available externally, use a virtual private\nnetwork (VPN) or other means to authenticate and secure the connection before\nallowing RDP to connect to internal devices. Monitor remote access/RDP logs, enforce\naccount lockouts after a specified number of attempts to block brute force attempts, log\nRDP login attempts, and disable unused remote access/RDP ports.\n```\n        o Ensure devices are properly configured and that security features are enabled. Disable\n\n```\nports and protocols that are not being used for a business purpose (e.g., RDP\nTransmission Control Protocol Port 3389).\n\n     - **Provide end-user awareness and training to help prevent successful targeted social**\nengineering and spearphishing campaigns. Phishing is one of the top infection vectors for\nransomware, and Russian state-sponsored APT actors have conducted successful\nspearphishing campaigns to gain credentials of target networks.\n```\n        o Ensure that employees are aware of potential cyber threats and delivery methods. \n        o Ensure that employees are aware of what to do and whom to contact when they\n\n```\nreceive a suspected phishing email or suspect a cyber incident.\n\nAs part of a longer-term effort, implement network segmentation to separate network segments\n**based on role and functionality. Network segmentation can help prevent the spread of ransomware**\nand threat actor lateral movement by controlling traffic flows between—and access to—various\nsubnetworks.\n\n     - Ensure OT assets are not externally accessible. Ensure strong identity and access\nmanagement when OT assets needs to be externally accessible.\n\n     - Appropriately implement network segmentation between IT and OT networks. Network\nsegmentation limits the ability of adversaries to pivot to the OT network even if the IT network\nis compromised. Define a demilitarized zone that eliminates unregulated communication\nbetween the IT and OT networks.\n\n     - Organize OT assets into logical zones by considering criticality, consequence, and operational\nnecessity. Define acceptable communication conduits between the zones and deploy security\ncontrols to filter network traffic and monitor communications between zones. Prohibit ICS\nprotocols from traversing the IT network.\n\nTo further prepare for and mitigate cyber threats from Russian state-sponsored or criminal actors,\nU.S., Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, and UK cyber authorities encourage critical infrastructure\norganizations to implement the recommendations listed below.\n\n\n**TLP:WHITE** Product ID: AA22-110A\n\n\n-----\n\n**TLP:WHITE** Product ID: AA22-110A\n\n### Preparing for Cyber Incidents\n\n     - Create, maintain, and exercise a cyber incident response and continuity of operations plan.\n```\n        o Ensure the cyber incident response plan contains ransomware- and DDoS-specific\n\n```\nannexes. For information on preparing for DDoS attacks, see NCSC-UK guidance on\n[preparing for denial-of-service attacks.](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/denial-service-dos-guidance-collection/preparing-denial-service-dos-attacks1)\n```\n        o Keep hard copies of the incident response plan to ensure responders and network\n\n```\ndefenders can access the plan if the network has been shut down by ransomware, etc.\n\n     - Maintain offline (i.e., physically disconnected) backups of data. Backup procedures should be\nconducted on a frequent, regular basis (at a minimum every 90 days). Regularly test backup\nprocedures and ensure that backups are isolated from network connections that could enable\nthe spread of malware.\n```\n        o Ensure the backup keys are kept offline as well, to prevent them being encrypted in a\n\n```\nransomware incident.\n\n     - Ensure all backup data is encrypted, immutable (i.e., cannot be altered or deleted), and covers\nthe entire organization’s data infrastructure with a particular focus on key data assets.\n\n     - Develop recovery documentation that includes configuration settings for common devices and\ncritical equipment. Such documentation can enable more efficient recovery following an\nincident.\n\n     - Identify the attack surface by mapping and accounting all external-facing assets (applications,\nservers, IP addresses) that are vulnerable to DDoS attacks or other cyber operations.\n\n     - For OT assets/networks:\n```\n        o Identify a resilience plan that addresses how to operate if you lose access to—or\n\n```\ncontrol of—the IT and/or OT environment.\n```\n        o Identify OT and IT network interdependencies and develop workarounds or manual\n\n```\ncontrols to ensure ICS networks can be isolated from IT networks if the connections\ncreate risk to the safe and reliable operation of OT processes. Regularly test\ncontingency plans, such as manual controls, so that safety-critical functions can be\nmaintained during a cyber incident. Ensure that the OT network can operate at\nnecessary capacity even if the IT network is compromised.\n```\n        o Regularly test manual controls so that critical functions can be kept running if ICS or\n\n```\nOT networks need to be taken offline.\n```\n        o Implement data backup procedures.\n        o Develop recovery documents that include configuration settings for common devices\n\n```\nand critical OT equipment.\n\n### Identity and Access Management\n\n     - [Require accounts with password logins, including service accounts, to have strong](https://www.us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-002) passwords\nand do not allow passwords to be used across multiple accounts or stored on a system to\nwhich an adversary may have access.

Use network monitoring tools and host-based\nlogs and monitoring tools, such as an endpoint detection and response (EDR) tool. EDR tools\nare particularly useful for detecting lateral connections as they have insight into common and\nuncommon network connections for each host.\n\n     - Implement a firewall and configure it to block Domain Name System (DNS) responses from\noutside the enterprise network or drop Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) packets.\nReview which admin services need to be accessible externally and allow those explicitly,\nblocking all others by default.\n```\n        o U.S. Defense Industrial Base organizations may sign up for the NSA Cybersecurity\n\n```\nCollaboration Center’s Protective Domain Name System (PDNS) services.\n\n     - Enable web application firewalls to mitigate application-level DDoS attacks.\n\n     - Implement a multi-content delivery network (CDN) solution. This will minimize the threat of\nDDoS attacks by distributing and balancing web traffic across a network.\n\n### Vulnerability and Configuration Management\n\n     - Use an antivirus programs that uses heuristics and reputational ratings to check a file’s\nprevalence and digital signature prior to execution. Note: organizations should assess the\nrisks inherent in their software supply chain (including its security/antivirus software supply\nchain) in light of the existing threat landscape.\n```\n        o Set antivirus/antimalware programs to conduct regular scans of IT network assets\n\n```\nusing up-to-date signatures.\n```\n        o Use a risk-based asset inventory strategy to determine how OT network assets are\n\n```\nidentified and evaluated for the presence of malware.\n\n     - Implement rigorous configuration management programs. Ensure the programs can track and\nmitigate emerging threats. Review system configurations for misconfigurations and security\nweaknesses.\n\n     - Disable all unnecessary ports and protocols.\n```\n        o Review network security device logs and determine whether to shut off unnecessary\n\n```\nports and protocols.

Threat\nactors use SMB to propagate malware across organizations.\n\n     - Review the security posture of third-party vendors and those interconnected with your\norganization. Ensure all connections between third-party vendors and outside software or\nhardware are monitored and reviewed for suspicious activity.\n\n     - Implement listing policies for applications and remote access that only allow systems to\nexecute known and permitted programs under an established security policy.\n\n     - Open document readers in protected viewing modes to help prevent active content from\nrunning.\n\n### Responding to Cyber Incidents\n\nU.S., Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, and UK cybersecurity authorities urge network defenders\nof critical infrastructure organizations to exercise due diligence in identifying indicators of malicious\nactivity. Organizations detecting potential APT or ransomware activity in their IT or OT networks\nshould:\n\n1. Immediately isolate affected systems.\n\n2. For DDoS attacks:\n\na. Identify the source address originating the attack via the SIEM or logging service. If the\nattack is originating from a single pool of IP addresses, block IP traffic from suspected\nIPs via access control lists or by contacting your internet service provider (ISP).\n\nb. Enable firewall rate limiting to restrict the amount of IP traffic coming in from suspected\nIP addresses\n\nc. Notify your ISP and enable remote triggered blackhole (RTBH).\n\n3. Secure backups. Ensure your backup data is offline and secure. If possible, scan your backup\ndata with an antivirus program to ensure it is free of malware.\n\n4. Collect and review relevant logs, data, and artifacts.\n\n5. Consider soliciting support from a third-party IT organization to provide subject matter\nexpertise, ensure the actor is eradicated from the network, and avoid residual issues that\ncould enable follow-on exploitation.\n\n6.
