This campaign, led by a persistent attacker group, has successfully penetrated a large number of targets\nusing various attack techniques, and specifically, a custom-made malware implant codenamed Explosive.\n\nThis report provides an extended technical analysis of Volatile Cedar and the Explosive malware.\n\nMalware attribution is often tricky and deception-prone. With that in mind, investigation of the evidence leads us to suspect Volatile\n_Cedar originates from Lebanon (hence its nickname). Moreover, the Volatile Cedar target vertical distribution strongly aligns with_\nnation-state/political-group interests, eliminating the possibility of financially motivated attackers.\n\nWe have seen clear evidence that Volatile Cedar has been active for almost 3 years. While many of the technical aspects of the threat\nare not considered “cutting edge”, the campaign has been continually and successfully operational throughout this entire timeline,\nevading detection by the majority of AV products. This success is due to a well-planned and carefully managed operation that con­\nstantly monitors its victims’ actions and rapidly responds to detection incidents.\n\n_Volatile Cedar is heavily based on a custom-made remote access Trojan named Explosive, which is implanted within its targets and_\nthen used to harvest information. Tracking down these infections was quite a difficult task due to the multiple concealment measures\ntaken by the attackers. The attackers select only a handful of targets to avoid unnecessary exposure. New and custom versions are\ndeveloped, compiled and deployed specifically for certain targets, and ”radio silence” periods are configured and embedded specifi­\ncally into each targeted implant.\n\nThe modus operandi for this attacker group initially targets publicly facing web servers, with both automatic and manual vulnerabil­\nity discovery. Once in control of a server, the attackers further penetrate the targeted internal network via various means, including\nmanual online hacking as well as an automated USB infection mechanism.\n\nWe will discuss the attack vectors and infection techniques used by the attack campaign as well as provide indicators that can be\nused to detect and remove the infection.\n\nFor hashes, domains, IP addresses and other indicators of compromise, see Appendix C.\n\nSome of the details in this investigation were edited or omitted from this report to protect customer privacy and ongoing research\nefforts. Further information may be released in future reports.\n\n#### OVERVIEW\n\n_Volatile Cedar is a highly targeted and very well-managed campaign. Its targets are carefully chosen, confining the infection spread to_\nthe bare minimum required to achieve the attacker’s goal while minimizing the risk of exposure. Our analysis leads us to believe that\nthe attackers conduct a fair amount of intelligence gathering to tailor each infection to its specific target.\n\nThe campaign's initial targets are mostly public web servers, running the Windows operating system. We believe this is because\nthese servers serve as publicly exposed, easily accessible gateways to private and more secure internal networks. As these servers\nhave a common business functionality, their security is often sacrificed for productivity, making them an easy target for attackers.\nOnce the attacker gains control over these servers, he can use them as a pivot point to explore, identify, and attack additional targets\nlocated deeper inside the internal network.\n\nThe typical Volatile Cedar attack begins with a vulnerability scan of the target server. Once an exploitable vulnerability is located, it is\nused to inject a web shell code into the server. The web shell is then used by the attacker to control the victim server and is the means\nthrough which the Explosive Trojan is implanted into the victim server. This Trojan allows the attackers to send commands to all\ntargets via an array of C&C servers. The command list contains all the functionality required by the attacker to maintain control and\nextract information from the servers and includes keylogging, clipboard logging, screenshots, run commands, etc.\n\nOccasionally, mostly in cases where large data extractions are required, the attacker sets up additional SSH tunnels connecting to the\nattacker-controlled servers.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### ATTACK TIMELINE\n\nThe first evidence of any Explosive version was detected in November 2012. Over the course of the timeline, several versions have\nbeen detected. New version release dates appear to be closely related to the occurrence of an AV detection event on the previous\nversion, a fact which emphasizes the efforts taken to conceal the attack.\n\nThe latest Explosive version was released in June 2014 and is still active at the time of this publication. See the figure below for\nmore details.\n\n_Figure 1 - Explosive version timeline_\n\n#### STEALTH\n\nThe Explosive Trojan goes to a lot of effort to hide from common detection tools and merge into its surroundings.\n\n- AV detections are avoided by frequently checking AV results and changing versions and builds on all infected servers when any\n\ntraces of detection appear. See Figure 1.\n\n- New versions are equipped with a dedicated thread to monitor memory consumption to prevent common server administration\n\nutilities from detecting the Explosive processes. Once Explosive’s memory consumption reaches a predefined threshold, its\nhosting process is immediately restarted.\n\n- API activities which may be considered suspicious are detached from the main logic file and contained in a separate DLL.\n\nThis enables the attackers to make sure that heuristic detections do not lead to exposure of the Trojan logic itself.\n\n- Custom configurations are set on a per target basis. For example, each Trojan configuration contains periods of “radio silence”\n\nduring which Explosive does not initiate any network communication. These periods are set according to the specific target’s\nworking hours and low traffic periods.\n\n- Obfuscated C&C communication may appear as random network traffic “noise” to certain network inspection devices.\n\n- A dedicated thread makes periodic “secure checks” with the C&C server to confirm that it is safe to operate. Once the response to\n\nthese checks is negative, the Explosive Trojan ceases all operations until instructed otherwise.\n\n#### CONTROL NETWORK\n\nThe campaign uses a multi-tiered server backend framework to control the targeted systems. This backend framework is composed\nof 3 major tiers:\n\n\n-----\n\n**Tier 1** **C&C servers: Each Explosive Trojan attempts to connect to its C&C servers, which are used to send commands and receive**\ninformation extracted from the targets. Each Explosive version has a default hardcoded C&C address. Different versions use\ndifferent C&C servers.\n\n**• Tier 2—Static update servers: These servers are periodically connected to obtain the current C&C address. If a new C&C address**\n\nis available, the default C&C server is updated with the new one. The static C&C updater address is also hardcoded as part of the\n_Explosive configuration section._\n\n**• Tier 3—Dynamic update servers: If the static C&C server is nonresponsive, the Explosive infection initiates a custom DGA algo­**\n\nrithm which attempts to connect to the dynamic update servers. Once connected, these servers operate the same way as the static\nupdaters. Some Explosive versions also use the dynamic update servers as their C&C servers.\n\nThe server framework is diverse. While some servers are owned (and possibly also hosted) by the attackers, other servers use\npublicly shared hosting frameworks or even compromised legitimate servers.\n\n_Table 1 - Explosive server infrastructure_\n\n#### INFECTION SPREAD\n\nEvidence shows that the Explosive Trojan leverages its keylogging capabilities to gain access to administrator passwords entered on\nthe target servers. Additionally, residues of custom-built port scanners and several other attack tools have been found on the victim\nservers, leading us to believe the attackers use the initially infected servers as a pivot to manually spread to the entire network.\n\nMore recent versions of the Explosive Trojan contain a configurable option for USB infection. When this option is enabled, Explosive\ninfects any writable mass storage device connected to the server. This can be used to infect additional servers in environments where\noperational mass storage devices are shared between servers as well as infect an administrator’s home or office machines\n\n\n-----\n\n#### ATTRIBUTION\n\nMalware attribution has always been a difficult task and Volatile Cedar is no different. Although we have no hard evidence upon which\nto base our conclusions, and many of the factors we rely on can in theory be forged or misinterpreted, we believe the unique combination\nof these factors reveal the attacker’s agenda and provide a good estimation of his whereabouts.\n\n**1. To assign a rough geographical location, we observed the UTC creation times of detected samples. The results can be seen in the**\n\nfollowing table:\n\n_Figure 2 - Explosive sample UTC compilation hours_\n\nWith conventional working hours usually between 08:00-17:00, the creation locale time can be comfortably correlated to GMT+2.\n\n**2. To further align our results, we took into account several other factors collected from the C&C server infrastructure:**\n\n - The C&C servers for the first Explosive version were hosted at a major Lebanese hosting company. This is not commonly seen in\n\nthe malware arena.\n\n - DNS registrant information from several of the infrastructure servers shows that they are or were previously registered under\n\ncontacts with a very similar Lebanese address.\n\n - Careful observation of DNS registrant contact information history has revealed an OPSEC failure by the attackers in one instance.\n\nFor a brief period (possibly before the server was operational), WHOIS privacy was inactive, pointing at a real identity of the regis­\ntrant. This e-mail address leads to social media accounts that show public and clear affinity with Lebanese political activism.\n\nWhile not all of the targets have been identified yet, we can start building a profile of the intended victims. Some of the confirmed tar­\ngets can be associated with organizations related to the state of Israel, and some are Lebanon-based, potentially testifying to in-state\nespionage among rival political groups.\n\nOther factors to consider are the low infection rate and the targeted nature of this campaign. These suggest that the attacker’s\nmotives are not financial but aim to extract sensitive information from the targets.The combination of these factors leads us to\nbelieve that the attack originated or is sponsored by groups affiliated with Lebanon and the specific targets are chosen based on\nnation-state/political-group interests.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### EXPLOSIVE ANALYSIS\n\nThe Explosive Trojan contains 2 major components:\n\n- The main executable binary\n\n- A DLL file containing “backend” API calls\n\nThe main executable file contains most of the Trojan logic, while the DLL primarily contains exported actionable API functions. The\n_Explosive DLL file is dynamically loaded by the main executable at runtime whenever it is needed, and unloaded when the desired_\naction is complete.\n\nThis separation is probably designed to support quick functionality patches by the attackers, and to avoid heuristic detection of the\nmain executable by common AV engines and other protection software.\n\n**Exported DLL**\n\n**Description** **Version**\n**Function**\n\nCON Main communication API. All\n\nGetAllData Collect extensive data from user, OS and applications. All\n\nGetIEHistory Get Internet Explorer's history of browsing data.

The main executable is a console application\nwhich supports several optional command-line arguments used to control the Trojan’s behavior:\n\n**Option** **Function**\n\n-i Install the Explosive Trojan as a service. The service is usually created with a blank description.\n\n-h \\ -x Force the Explosive Trojan to a 20 second delay on startup.\n\n-d Stop the Explosive process, and remove all traces of infection from the system.\n\n_Table 3 - Optional command line options_\n\nOnce installed, the Explosive Trojan creates several threads to support its functionality:\n\n**Thread #** **Description**\n\nKey Logger A basic implementation of a Windows key logger using the SetWindowsHookEx API call.\n\nClipboard Logger Logs all clipboard data implemented by periodically opening and peeking into the current user\nclipboard data.\n\nMemory Monitor Constantly monitors Explosive’s memory consumption by calling the GetProcessMemoryInfo API and\nreading WorkingSetSize.\n\nC&C Secure Checks Periodically connects to the C&C server with a special connection string, and determines if the\nconnection is secure by the return of a predefined value. If the connection is not secure, all operations\nare stopped until a secure connection is achieved.\n\n_Table 4 - Main explosive threads_\n\n|Exported DLL Function|Description|Version|\n|---|---|---|\n|CON|Main communication API.|All|\n|GetAllData|Collect extensive data from user, OS and applications.|All|\n|GetIEHistory|Get Internet Explorer's history of browsing data.|All|\n|OpenClipFn|OpenClipboard wrapper.|3|\n|PathProcess|Locate and kill currently loaded Explosive modules.|All|\n|SetWinHoK|Wrapper around SetWindowsHookExA.|All|\n|Registerapp|Write Explosive registry values.|All|\n|CreateNewFile|Create a new Explosive instance on external mass storage device.|1, 2|\n|Fdown|URLDownloadToFile wrapper.|1|\n\n|Option|Function|\n|---|---|\n|-i|Install the Explosive Trojan as a service.

Uses the same C&C server framework.\n\n_Table 5 - Explosive versions_\n\nThe earliest version of Explosive is version 1, and the first sample compiled is dated to November 2012. This version includes very\nbasic backdoor features. C&C communication is not obfuscated. The default C&C server is no longer active, and we believe no infec­\ntions of this version are currently active.\n\n**Version 2 and Version 3 are more mature implementations of the Explosive Trojan, with added concealment and operational features**\nas well as a new set of supported actions for C&C commands.\n\nThe KS version is very similar in functionality to other Explosive versions. However, this version has no communication functionality\nand is most probably used by the attackers to avoid network detection in special cases. This version stores the extracted server data\non the server's file system to be downloaded later by the attacker using the pre-installed web shell.\n\n**Micro seems to be an early ancestor of the Explosive Trojan. Only a few samples of it were detected. Micro does not use the same C&C**\nserver or protocol as the other versions, but uses the “dynamic updater” framework to pass commands via HTTP. For more details of\nthe Micro version, see Appendix A.\n\n#### CONFIGURATION\n\nEach of the main Explosive binary files contains an integrated configuration section, which is located at a fixed position in the binary\nimage overlay. The configuration section itself is not encrypted but the readable configuration values are stored as obfuscated strings.\n\n_Figure 3 - Explosive Configuration Section_\n\n|Explosive Version|Description|\n|---|---|\n|Version 1|Un-obfuscated network traffic.|\n|Version 2|Most common version, clipboard monitoring added.|\n|Version 3|Most advanced version detected.|\n|KS Version|Uses only keyboard and clipboard hooking modules.|\n|Micro|Possible ancestor.

All\n\nDLD-USI Removable device infection flag. All\n\n_Table 6 - Configuration parameters_\n\n#### OBFUSCATION\n\n_Explosive uses custom obfuscation techniques to encode configuration values, C&C communication, and C&C updating protocols._\nThe obfuscation algorithm is not very advanced and does not attempt to merge the obfuscated data into its surroundings. The\nprimary motivation for this obfuscation appears to be to avoid detection by automated security tools such as antivirus or IPS engines.\n\n#### CONFIGURATION ENCODING\n\nBoth the configuration and C&C updating data use a custom ASCII encoding algorithm in which each plaintext character is\ntransformed into its hex ASCII value equivalent and separated by a ‘@’ sign.\nFor example, the configuration value:\n```\n“50@49@50@46@49@55@57@46@49@56@48@46@49@50@51@”\n\n```\nis decoded into the plaintext string:\n```\n“212.179.180.123”.\n\n```\n|Parameter Name|Description|Version|\n|---|---|---|\n|DLD-ACT|Explosive constantly attempts to update its C&C IP address when this flag is set.|All|\n|DLD-C|A unique identifier used for updating C&C communication.|All|\n|DLD-C0|Same as DLD-C.|All|\n|DLD-D|URL for the static C&C updater.|All|\n|DLD-E|TLD of the dynamic C&C updater.|All|\n|DLD-P|Path for the dynamic C&C updater.|All|\n|DLD-IHC|No communication is generated during “silent mode” when this flag is set.|2, 3|\n|DLD-IH1|Starting hour of “silent mode.”|2, 3|\n|DLD-IH2|Ending hour of “silent mode.”|2, 3|\n|DLD-PRT|Default C&C Port.|All|\n|DLD-IP|Default C&C IP address.|All|\n|DLD-OIP|Other (additional) C&C IP addresses.|3|\n|DLD-NTI|Delay time between C&C connections.|All|\n|DLD-RCH|Registration related.|2, 3|\n|DLD-RL|Registration related.|2, 3|\n|DLD-RN|Registry key name.|All|\n|DLD-S|Initial value for dynamic C&C updating DGA.|All|\n|DLD-SN|Installed service name.|2, 3|\n|DLD-ST|Installed service type.|2, 3|\n|DLD-TN|Unique identifier for C&C communication.|All|\n|DLD-USA|Removable device infection method.|All|\n|DLD-USI|Removable device infection flag.|All|\n\n\n-----\n\nThe following Python code can be used to encode\\decode the configuration strings:\n\n_Figure 4 - Configuration parameter decoding_\n\n#### COMMUNICATION ENCODING\n\nStarting from Version 2, C&C network traffic is encoded using a custom algorithm. To encode the data, the plaintext bytecode is\nreversed, base64 encoded, and reversed again.\n\n_Figure 5 - Communication encoding scheme_\n\n#### COMMUNICATION\n\n_Explosive's communication algorithm is very complex and contains many, often unnecessary, branches and loops._\n\nA hardcoded C&C IP address in embedded in Explosive's main module. Explosive initially attempts to connect to this preset C&C\naddress. If the C&C server is nonresponsive, the hardcoded static updater server is contacted to obtain an updated C&C address.\nIf the static updater is also nonresponsive, a custom DGA algorithm is used to produce a “dynamic updater” domain name, which is a\nsecondary C&C updater server. This server has the same functionality as the static server, with the exception of its operating URI.\n\nThe only DGA initial value we observed in our obtained samples was ‘redotntexplore’.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6 - Explosive C&C Communication Schema_\n\n#### C&C COMMUNICATION\n\nThe C&C communication is performed using raw TCP sockets and encoded[1] using the previously mentioned communication\nencoding scheme.\n\nOnce the Explosive module successfully initiates communication with its C&C server, it sends an authentication password\nand additional data identifying the infected target.\n\n_Figure 7 - Initial C&C Request (Encoded)_\n\n1 With the exception of Explosive version 1 which does not encode its C&C traffic\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8 – Initial C&C Request (Decoded)_\n\nAs seen in Figure 8, the initial C&C request contains the following information:\n\n**Parameter** **Description**\n\nA fixed (encoded) password field. This value remains the same for all analyzed\nPassword\n_Explosive versions. The decoded password value is: <*`1Q2W3E4r1’*>_\n\nIdentifier A value identifying the specific Explosive version and port.\n\nThe IP of the gateway connecting this IP to the Internet.\nThis value is extracted from a query to “whatismyip2.somee.com” or “api.externalip.\nnet” that takes place just before the initial C&C communication.\n\nClient External IP\n\nIf both of the “what-is-my-ip” services are not available, a custom service with\nsimilar functionality located at the C&C server over TCP/8084 is connected.\nIf all queries fail, this value is set to “0.0.0.0” (or local IP in some versions)\n\nUsername\\PID The current logged in username and process ID.\n\nHostname The infected host name.\n\nSystem Name The running OS, retrieved from the ‘systeminfo’ CLI command output.\n\nInstallation path Current executable full path and file name.\n\n_Table 7 - Information sent during initial C&C communication_\n\nNext, the C&C server responds with a confirmation message, followed by an optional list of commands for the Explosive module.\nThe confirmation message always starts with the encoded string ‘<!*connectok*!>’.\n\n_Figure 9 - C&C <!*connectok*!> Response_\n\n|Parameter|Description|\n|---|---|\n|Password|A fixed (encoded) password field. This value remains the same for all analyzed Explosive versions. The decoded password value is: <*`1Q2W3E4r1’*>|\n|Identifier|A value identifying the specific Explosive version and port.|\n|Client External IP|The IP of the gateway connecting this IP to the Internet. This value is extracted from a query to “whatismyip2.somee.com” or “api.externalip. net” that takes place just before the initial C&C communication.

To disguise\nthe server, the server's default (root) web page is a ripped HTML page from a random Internet site with all links and functionality redi­\nrecting to the original site.\n\nOnce the Explosive client generates a GET request to a specific URI, a custom HTTP response is returned with a unique identifier, and\nthe IP address and port of the new C&C server.\n\n_Figure 10 - Static C&C Updater Request_\n\nAs opposed to the static updater, the dynamic updater does not contain a hardcoded address value in the configuration section.\nInstead, it uses an initial value as an input argument for a custom DGA algorithm to produce the server address.\n\nThe same routine used by the static updater for updating the C&C data is used on each DGA algorithm result until a verified answer is\nreceived. Once this occurs, the DGA algorithm terminates and the current updater is set as the new static updater server.\n\nThe resulting address from the DGA algorithm can be one of 170 possible permutations of the initial value.\n\n|Decoded C&C Command|Description|\n|---|---|\n|*DumpHist*|Dump IE history.|\n|*DumpPass*|Dump saved passwords.|\n|*GetRegValue*|Get a specified registry value.|\n|*ListProcess*|List all running processes.|\n|*RunCmd*|Run a specified command line.|\n|*GetFile*|Send a specific file to the C&C server.|\n|*UnZip*<|Decompress a specified file to folder.|\n|*DeleteFiles*<|Delete specified files.|\n|*GetDrivesFolder*<|Get the content of a specific folder.|\n|<!*KILL*!>|Kill Explosive process.|\n|<!*RERUN*!>|Restart Explosive process.|\n|<!*DEL*!>|Kill Explosive process and remove all traces.|\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 11 - Dynamic C&C updater DGA algorithm_\n\nSeveral indicators can be used to identify all Explosive HTTP communications:\n\n**1.

All GET requests are made to a URI starting with an uncommon double slash value.**\n\n\n“GET //v2/443/index.php?win=4”\n\n\n#### CONNECTIVITY CHECKS\n\nConnectivity checks are made at several stages of the malware communication algorithm. Explosive attempts to connect to several\nwell-known sites to verify if the infected host is connected to the Internet. For reasons not yet fully understood, the results of these\nchecks are completely disregarded, and the communication algorithm continues normally regardless.\n\nThe list of sites checked for connectivity is slightly different in various versions of Explosive. The latest version contains the following sites:\n\n- microsoft.com\n\n- maktoob.yahoo.com\n\n- bing.com\n\n- google.com\n\n\n-----\n\n#### APPENDIX A – MICRO\n\nMicro is a rare Explosive version. It can best be described as a completely different version of the Trojan, with similarities to the rest of\n_Explosive “family” (such as configuration and code base). We believe that Micro is actually an old ancestor of Explosive, from which all_\nother versions were developed. As in other versions, this version is also dependent on a self-developed DLL named “wnhelp.dll.”\n\nMicro shares the same DGA algorithm as the other versions of Explosive and therefore has the same dynamic update server infra­\nstructure. This version, however, uses the dynamic server infrastructure as its C&C server; it connects to a dedicated URI and uses\ndifferent PHP parameters.\n\n```\nhttp://exloreredotnt.info/micro/data/index.php?micro=4\n\n```\n\n_Table 9 – Example of a Micro version URL_\n\nMicro has a small configuration (also stored encoded) which uses the same encoding scheme and is located at the binary file overlay.\n\n_Table 10 - Micro version configuration values_\n\nC&C commands are sent via the PHP page. The Micro process parses these commands and runs the appropriate function. A file\nnamed ‘prdata.sys’ contains information about the infected host such as the MAC address, computer name and user name. Another\nfile ‘sdata.sys’, located in the same folder, contains the last C&C server active path. Both of these files are stored encoded.\n\nMicro also creates two other temporary files, ‘systmp.dat’ and ‘systmp2.dat’, in the %temp% folder.\n\nMicro uses the same hardcoded User-Agent value as the other versions, and uses the same command line arguments ‘-i’ and ‘-d’ to\ninstall as service and kill the malware, respectively.\n\n#### APPENDIX B – REMOVABLE MEDIA INFECTION\n\n_Explosive has integrated functionality to enable USB and other mass storage device infection. The functionality can be enabled_\nor disabled by setting the DLD-USI flag in the configuration section.\n\nWhen enabled, an additional configuration option, DLD-USA, dictates the specific infection method. The possible infection methods are:\n\n- **Autorun.exe – Explosive copies itself into the USB root directory and changes the filename to ‘autorun.exe.’**\n\n- **Autorun.inf – This is the same as the ‘autorun.exe’ option, but with an additional ‘autorun.inf’ file copied into the same directory.**\n\n- **EXE infection – Explosive scans all *.exe files located in the USB drive, looking for previous infections. Previous infections are**\n\nlocated by using the Exported PathProcess function from the Explosive DLL. If no previous infections were found, Explosive copies\neach *.exe file into the system’s temporary folder (%temp%) and adds both the Explosive EXE and DLL files to its binary data To\nextract the injected files, a “Loader” binary is then injected into the file's binary. This “Loader” is set to be the main executable\nmodule. Once the injected file is executed, the “Loader” code is used to extract the Explosive files and resume the functionality\nof the original file. After the infection is complete, all infected files are returned to the USB drive and overwrite the original file. A\nspecial string “^!#^~|” is used by the “Loader” to parse and run the executable file.\n\n- All – Uses all of the listed options.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### APPENDIX C INDICATORS OF COMPROMISE\n\n##### Host Based IOCs\n\n**Service Names**\n_Explosive can be installed with the following service names.
