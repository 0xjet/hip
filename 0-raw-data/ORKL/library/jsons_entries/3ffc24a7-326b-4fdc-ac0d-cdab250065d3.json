Box 4100\nHarrisburg, PA 17111-0100\nPhone: 717-944-1300\nFax: 717-944-1625\nWebsite: www.phoenixcontact.com\n\n\n-----\n\n**Hacking the Industrial Network**\n**Is Your Production Line or Process Management System at Risk?**\n\n**The Problem**\n\nMalicious code, a Trojan program deliberately inserted into SCADA system software, manipulated valve positions\nand compressor outputs to cause a massive natural gas explosion along the Trans-Siberian pipeline, according to\n2005 testimony before a U.S. House of Representatives subcommittee by a Director from Sandia National\nLaboratories.1 According to the Washington Post, the resulting fireball yielded “the most monumental non-nuclear\nexplosion and fire ever seen from space.”2 The explosion was subsequently estimated at the equivalent of 3\nkilotons.3 (In comparison, the 9/11 explosions at the World Trade Center were roughly 0.1 kiloton.)\n\nAccording to Internet blogs and reports, hackers have begun to discover that SCADA (Supervisory Control and\nData Acquisition) and DCS (Distributed Control Systems) are “cool” to hack.4 The interest of hackers has\nincreased since reports of successful attacks began to emerge after 2001. A security consultant interviewed by the\nin-depth news program, PBS Frontline, told them “Penetrating a SCADA system that is running a Microsoft\noperating system takes less than two minutes.”5 DCS, SCADA, PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers) and other\nlegacy control systems have been used for decades in power plants and grids, oil and gas refineries, air traffic and\nrailroad management, pipeline pumping stations, pharmaceutical plants, chemical plants, automated food and\nbeverage lines, industrial processes, automotive assembly lines, and water treatment plants.\n\nSandia National Laboratories has been chartered over the last 15 years with testing and improving the security of\nU.S. infrastructure control systems. When interviewed by Frontline, they confirm that their Red Team has never\nfailed to penetrate a U.S. system using publicly available methods. When they refer to the term SCADA, they\ninclude all real-time digital control systems, process control systems and other related technologies.\n\n**The History**\n\nIntroduced in the late 1960s, PLCs were designed to eliminate the higher cost of complicated, relay-based control\nsystems. By the 1980s, Distributed Control Systems achieved popularity within increasingly automated plant\nenvironments, with keyboards and workstations replacing large, individual control cabinets. Entire production lines\nand processes could be linked over industrial cable/bus networks (Modbus, Profibus, Fieldbus and others) to\nprovide monitoring and control to a foreman’s desk. Dials, gauges and idiot lights were replaced by a pictorial\nrepresentation of the process with fields displaying real-time information. The available systems were\n“proprietary,” capturing market share by staying incompatible with competitive systems. By 1998, however,\ncustomers were beginning to demand open systems, common protocols and vendor interoperability. This closely\n\nPHOENIX CONTACT • P.O.

They remained largely incompatible.\n\nIt is also true that any given facility, be it a public utility, process, or production line, will contain a mix of old and\nnew technologies. There will be rudimentary systems that remain in place because they still work, and new high\nspeed processes that reflect the latest developments in efficiency and reduced cost. The oldest systems may have\nbeen designed or installed by long-departed engineers, and the documentation on these systems may be sketchy, as\nwill be the documentation of modifications made over time.\n\n**Ethernet**\n\nIt was obvious from the beginning of the new millennium that the next logical step would be the requirement of\nEthernet connectivity between the front office and the plant or processes. Ethernet triumphed as the de facto\nnetwork choice for corporate administration more than a decade ago. It was only a matter of time before it\nmigrated to the management of the factory floor.\n\nEthernet offers instant access to shared data for multiple departments – inventory, shipping and receiving,\npurchasing, accounting, production, sales, CAD/CAM engineering and process control. Standardization, real-time\naccess and better communication across the entire enterprise are some of the driving forces. Other drivers are\nthat Ethernet network equipment and applications are readily available, less expensive, easier to install, maintain\nand administrate.6\n\nA new industrial revolution is taking place on the factory floor as corporations discover the economic benefits of\nintegrating their Information Technology (IT) networks with legacy process control and production systems.\n\nMoore’s Law effectively predicted that processor speeds will double every 18 months. This means that new\ngadgets and smaller, better, faster computers have been developed with revolutionary speed. But while the IT and\ncomputer-based markets evolve rapidly, the industrial side of the end-user market is fairly slow to adapt. It is\nsometimes considered too expensive to do so, or too disruptive to the process or production. NASA’s Space\nShuttle control systems and the FAA Air Traffic Control systems are antiquated by decades because it is too\nexpensive and disruptive to update them.\n\nCapital equipment is intended for long-term use, and is likely to remain in use for 10-20 years, until the capital\nexpenditure has been amortized. As a result, it is not uncommon to find that the processors used in the\nequipment controls may be older versions, such as Intel 486, 386, or even 286 chips, as well as older versions of\noperating systems. These obsolete, reduced performance processors have long been grandfathered, and there is a\nlack of support for upgrades or software-based security solutions for obsolete technology. Even more critical are\nthe security risks for older Windows operating systems such as Windows 98, because Microsoft no longer\nsupports these versions with security updates.\n\nIt should be noted that mainstream support for Windows 2000 has expired and extended support will be dropped\nby July 2010. Security issues with Windows Vista are currently being reported with considerable frequency.\n\nSimilar problems exist for PCs running on the operating systems from other manufacturers. Often, older versions\nare no longer supported and security holes can no longer be closed through software patches. And some\nprocesses or production lines cannot easily be interrupted to install frequent patches or software upgrades. An\nupgrade must be tested and proven “to do no harm” before incorporated into a production line.\n\nThere are a wide range of security technologies that can be used to protect the corporate network, but these are\nless successful within a production network. Traditional hardware-based systems (routers, bridges) used in the\ncorporate network have the drawback that they can always be identified based on their Internet Protocol (IP)\naddress – and are therefore highly susceptible to attack. This is particularly due to the fact that in many systems,\nspecific numbered ports are left open in order to ensure unproblematic data transfer via the Internet connection.7\n\nPHOENIX CONTACT • P.O.

Moreover, they often can’t\nbe integrated into systems which use older processor technology – because these lack the necessary performance.\nBlocking a virus attack would demand so much of the processor’s abilities that the whole system would be\nparalyzed. It should be mentioned that vulnerable software constantly requires updates – otherwise viruses can\neasily attack the operating system time and again through newly detected security holes. Yet such updates are\ncomplex, requiring extensive resources in manpower and capital.\n\nFigure 1 illustrates a brief chronological history of publicly reported hacking incidents that provide a chilling insight\ninto the problems and their potential for disruption and disaster. Some of these damaging exploits were kept\nsecret for years. Many more incidents go unreported for reasons of national security or corporate embarrassment.\nEven more go undetected. Properly executed, successful hacks are undetectable and untraceable. Professional\nhackers, criminal organizations, terrorists and nation states can conceal their attacks by using fast-flux to bounce\ntheir actions through thousands of botnet zombie computers located in other nations. Critical industrial design\ninformation can be stolen, stored on remotely enslaved computers, and resold or ransomed back to the owner.8\n\n**“Some of these damaging exploits were kept secret for years.”**\n\n**Figure 1: A Short Chronological List of Widely Reported Incidents of Hacking and Disruption9**\n\nPHOENIX CONTACT • P.O.

It does not need to be an intelligently directed attack. The non-intelligent\nSlammer worm covered the globe in 30 minutes, infected business and Pentagon computers in the first eight\nminutes, and caused $3 billion worth of damage to Wall Street.10 Amateur soviet “kiddie-scripters” brought down\n“the most wired country in Europe” for two weeks through denial-of-service attacks by simply using botnets\nlocated in Egypt, Vietnam and Peru.11 Attacks on electrical and pipeline networks may seize the popular\nimagination, but the same industrial control networks are used in the production of everything from cars to candy\nbars. Worms and viruses can cause damage as easily as direct hacks.\n\n**Common Objections and Rationalizations**\n\n**_“Our production systems are completely isolated from outside access.”_**\n\nIn the 1980s, when almost everything was analog, this was largely true. But since that time, plant operators and\nengineers have migrated to PC-based monitoring and controls, using graphical overlays to illustrate the facility\nprocesses in real time. Engineering and management PCs also have access to the larger corporate network, as well\nas the Internet and Intranet. In his book “The Art of Intrusion,” expert Kevin Mittnick clearly explains how a\nhacker, even a neophyte, can easily gain root (administrator) access to the entire network through the\ncorporation’s public website, from anywhere in the world.12\n\nIt is common practice to include access to Web-based services on most programmable logic controllers.\nAccording to a major manufacturer of PLCs, the majority of their products are ordered with Web services\nenabled. Yet their own study indicated that only 13% of customers actually configured and used the Web services.\nSo 87% of users left the Web servers in the PLCs active with factory default passwords, like “1111.”13\n\n**_“Our system is secure because it would be impossible for an outsider to understand it.”_**\n\nThis is nicknamed “security by obscurity” and has repeatedly been shown to be a false assumption. If the\nweaknesses in millions of lines of “indecipherable” computer operating system code can be hacked, the\nrudimentary logic instruction of a Digital Control System offers few obstacles. Engineered for safety, systems are\ndesigned to perform an emergency shutdown when any or all of a string of dangerous conditions are detected by\ninstruments. These may include high/low limits of pressure, flow, temperature, liquid level, voltage, speed,\nexplosivity or other parameters that could lead to a condition that damages equipment or threatens personnel\nsafety. Recognizing and identifying such logic strings or icons on a ladder diagram is simplicity itself, even if the\nentire process is not completely understood.\n\nThere are only 5-6 leading DCS and SCADA systems used throughout the world, and there are millions of US and\nforeign engineers who have been trained in their use and implementation. Any suburban library will have on its\nshelves a dozen technical books on the precise methods of computer hacking. Cisco publishes a respected\ntextbook titled “Penetration Testing and Network Defense,” which can be applied to penetrate corporate\nsystems.14 And a new textbook titled “Hacking SCADA – Industrial Network Security from the Mind of the\nAttacker” is being offered on the Internet.15 Most of the SCADA manufacturers are foreign owned and most of US\ncritical infrastructure technology products are now manufactured overseas.16\n\n**_“We’re not a likely target. We’re not important or interesting enough to attract hackers.”_**\n\nIndividual personal computers are pinged and probed and tested every day while they are connected to the\nInternet. Regardless of the quality of antivirus software installed, malware (Trojans, viruses and worms) can be\ninadvertently downloaded from the Internet, and these can replicate themselves on portable memory devices of all\ntypes. In 2008, it was determined that digital picture frames, imported from China and sold by major big-box\nretailers (Best Buy, Sam’s Club, Target, Costco) were infected with a program that disabled antivirus software and\nthen sent passwords and financial information to servers in China.17 And the software was analyzed as being far\nmore capable and more sophisticated than required for these simple tasks.18 Two colonels of the Chinese People’s\nLiberation Army (PLA) had previously published “Unrestricted Warfare,” noting the use of computer network\nattacks, and the PLA has since coined the term “Integrated Network Electronic Warfare.”19\n\nPHOENIX CONTACT • P.O.

There has been no intrusion or disruption in our production network.”_**\n\nFollowing the successful “Eligible Receiver” attack on U.S. Department of Defense networks, new computer\nhardware and software was installed to see if anyone was getting in without permission. Within weeks of\ninstallation they showed that thousands of attempted illegal penetrations were going on daily. One general was\nincensed. “Before we had these IDS (Intrusion Detection Systems), we were never attacked. Now that we got\nthem on the network, people are attacking our nets every day thousands of times trying to get in! And some of\nthem are getting in!” 20\n\n**_“It hasn’t happened yet, so it seems unlikely. I don’t think it will happen.”_**\n\nNo one thought that commercial passenger jets would be hijacked and simultaneously flown into skyscrapers\neither. Or that a mediocre storm, Hurricane Katrina, would largely destroy New Orleans for years. Or that a\nsudden financial crisis would bring worldwide production to a virtual standstill.\n\n**_“We can’t justify the expense and manpower.”_**\n\nThe expense of protection is a fraction of 1% of the IT budget. With the latest generation of equipment, a network\nof protection can be installed, plug and play, by a handful of technicians rather than IT managers. Production need\nnot be interrupted. A security template, chosen by IT personnel from a CD loaded onto a server will automatically\nconfigure the parameters and level of protection for whole groups of thousands of devices. While Return on\nInvestment (ROI) is in the range of several hundred percent a year, the simplest justification is “What will we\nsuffer if a disaster shuts us down?”\n\n**Figure 2: Applications and Systems at Risk**\n\n**Industry Recommendations**\n\nThe consequences of production interruption in the industrial sector are much more serious than failures within\nthe office network. If a production line fails for several hours, it can result in a much higher cost to the company\nthan when a PC crashes in the office.\n\nIn 2005, the Zotob worm simultaneously attacked 175 major corporations including Caterpillar, General Electric,\nDaimlerChrysler and United Parcel Service.21 Thirteen U.S. DaimlerChrysler plants had to be shut down, idling\n\nPHOENIX CONTACT • P.O.

The worm was later determined\nto have originated in Turkey, and linked with a credit card fraud ring.23\n\n**“Thirteen U.S. DaimlerChrysler plants had to be shut down, idling their assembly lines and 50,000**\n**workers. What do you think that cost per hour?”**\n\nCorporate firewalls provide access security against Internet attacks from the outside world. Firewalls can protect\ncorporate networks from most external intruders. But the most harmful programs, capable of paralyzing\nautomation systems, are often introduced internally. Surveys reveal that roughly 40% of security incidents involved\ninsiders.24\n\nExternal service technicians and contractors may need to be given network access, and employees and visiting\nconsultants with laptops can inadvertently (or deliberately) introduce malicious software behind the external\nfirewall. The so-called security cordon of firewalls at border crossings between departments often does not\nprovide adequate protection. Effective decentralized approaches - referred to as “defense-in-depth” and “endpoint\nsecurity” in the literature - are required, as are corresponding systems for the security of endpoint devices. In\nprinciple, architectures with small, distributed security systems are preferred.\n\nThe latest recommendation by the ARC Advisory Group (Automation Research Corporation) and the U.S.\nNational Laboratories chartered to protect the economic technical infrastructure is to provide “defense-in-depth”\nby employing a distributed architecture with multiple firewalls and/or layers of firewalls.25 Just as mainframe\ncomputing evolved into PC networks, “defense-in-depth” security protection offers greater security, flexibility and\nlower cost.\n\nHow much money would be lost if production is interrupted for an hour, a day, or a month? It is a simple Return\non Investment equation. But establishing production network security bears a close relationship to the logic of\nadhering to fire codes. If production capability is lost or irreversibly damaged, the total damage to the organization\nand its employees is multiplied, widespread and very expensive.\n\n**The Solution**\n\nA 2006 study by industrial network planners Röwaplan AG compared the total costs of distributed versus\ncentralized security architectures.26 In a centralized approach, production system wiring leads to high first\ninvestment costs. The concentration of data terminals in the production area is usually low, so the utilization of\nswitch and router modules for a centralized architecture is not high enough to provide a cost-effective solution. A\ndistributed architecture is more economical.\n\nThe ideal solution would require several unique features. It should provide distributed “defense-in-depth” as a\nsecond or third layer of protection. It should be capable of providing various levels of security. It should be easy to\nimplement, by technicians rather than network administrators, without modification to the network’s existing\nconfiguration.\n\nTemplates for devices should be configurable for single units or very large groups from a central location. It should\nbe available in various appliance configurations, such as industrial mount, PCI card, patch cord dongle, and hotswap blades for a rack mounted backplane. It should be applicable in various network configurations. And it should\nprovide hardware and software-based security concepts in a single component that can be seamlessly patched\nbetween the network and the segment to be protected. No drivers or additional software should be required.\n\nPHOENIX CONTACT • P.O.

It should provide a\n“Stateful Inspection Firewall” that monitors incoming and outgoing data packets based on pre defined rules offering\nsecure and confidential communication via Virtual Private Network (VPN) tunnels. Ideally, the solution and firewall\nshould be invisible to detection by intruders attempting to map the network. It is also much harder for worms and\nviruses to attack the system if they cannot see it. Network Address Translation (NAT) could be used to provide\nprotection by IP address masquerading.\n\nSpecific industrial solutions exist. They may be lesser known in the IT world because they exist in the industrial\nspace, and they may be lesser known in the security world, where there is a tendency to concentrate on physical\nsecurity and physical access. They are fairly known and marketed through industrial control suppliers, but there\noften exists a legacy misconception that the industrial network remains independent of the IT network, or that IT\nfirewalls are sufficient. Having just one firewall as a gateway to the entire production network is insufficient\nprotection.\n\nPHOENIX CONTACT • P.O.

Unfortunately, dedicated modems have previously been employed to provide access, and modems are\nnotorious as unprotected backdoors into the network. The ideal solution would be one that denies access, even\nby the original manufacturer of the equipment, except when the equipment operations people request it, and when\nthe connection is strictly authenticated, preferably via digital certificates of authority.\n\nSome industrial-based solutions are already available. Products include Phoenix Contact FL mGuard™, Byers\nTofino, Siemens Scalance, Weidmüller IE, Emerson Delta V firewall, Hirschmann Eagle mGuard™, and Innominate\nmGuard™. But it was only Innominate Security Technologies AG, the original developer of mGuard, that won the\nFrost & Sullivan “2008 Global Ethernet Security Product Value Leadership of the Year Award,” for their mGuard™\nproduct family.27\n\nSome of the products listed above are derived from the Innominate product set or licensed and rebranded OEM\nproducts based on earlier Innominate software releases.28 For the protection of individual production cells, the\nmGuard™ security devices are used in a decentralized, distributed architecture. These security appliances, a\ncombination of hardware and software, have been designed specifically for use in industrial environments. They\ncombine the characteristics of a “Stateful Inspection Firewall” that offers options for encrypted, authenticated\ncommunication via VPN connections. An internationally patented “Stealth Mode” conceals the existence of the\ndevice, making it invisible to unauthorized detection via NAT IP masquerading. It offers high security for remote\nmaintenance applications and an anti-virus engine with free updates. High availability is provided through built-in\nrouter redundancy.

It is IP 20 rated for harsh industrial environments.\n\n**Figure 5: A remote services unit for DIN rail mounting with integrated analog modem or ISDN**\n**terminal adapter**\n\nUsers are often concerned about the costs of design, configuration and maintenance of the network components.\nBut the cost is not linear and decreases as the number of security devices rises, provided there is a central device\nmanagement solution. Such a software-based Innominate Device Manager™ provides sophisticated templates,\nautomated hierarchy, and an integrated Certificate Authority to produce VPN certificates with a high degree of\nautomation in the configuration and updating of individual devices.\n\nThus, with a push-pull mechanism, a central management console supplies needed information to the decentralized\ncomponents.\n\nFigure 6 illustrates a variety of application points within the zones of a typical office/factory network. Physically\ndifferent versions of the product are incorporated as required. In a telecommunications room, a backplane\nmounted in a 19” frame can effectively handle multiple paths from a single location. Multiple PCs, such as in an\nengineering group, can be protected with a slimline, rackmount unit. Individual PCs can be protected with PCI\ncards. HMI (Human Machine Interface) stations on the factory floor can be protected by modules that can be DIN\nrail mounted into NEMA cabinets. And portable dongle-style patchcord units can be used by remote technicians,\nengineers and consultants whenever they access the Internet or the network.\n\nPHOENIX CONTACT • P.O.
