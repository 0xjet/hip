    "plain_text": "# When Cats Fly: Suspected Iranian Threat Actor UNC1549 Targets Israeli and Middle East Aerospace and Defense Sectors\n\n**[mandiant.com/resources/blog/suspected-iranian-unc1549-targets-israel-middle-east](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/suspected-iranian-unc1549-targets-israel-middle-east)**\n\nToday Mandiant is releasing a blog post about suspected Iran-nexus espionage activity targeting the aerospace,\n**aviation and defense industries in Middle East countries, including Israel and the United Arab Emirates (UAE)**\nand potentially Turkey, India, and Albania.\n\n**Mandiant attributes this activity with moderate confidence to the Iranian actor UNC1549, which overlaps**\n[with Tortoiseshell—a threat actor that has been publicly linked to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps](https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-iran-espionage-catfishing-us-military/)\n**(IRGC). Tortoiseshell has previously attempted to compromise supply chains by targeting defense contractors and IT**\nproviders.\n\nThe potential link between this activity and the Iranian IRGC is noteworthy given the focus on defense-related\nentities and the recent tensions with Iran in light of the Israel-Hamas war. Notably, Mandiant observed an Israel**Hamas war-themed campaign that masquerades as the “Bring Them Home Now” movement, which calls for**\nthe return of the Israelis kidnapped and held hostage by Hamas.\n\nThis suspected UNC1549 activity has been active since at least June 2022 and is still ongoing as of February 2024.\nWhile regional in nature and focused mostly in the Middle East, the targeting includes entities operating worldwide.\n\nMandiant observed this campaigndeploy multiple evasion techniques to mask their activity, most prominently\nthe extensive use of Microsoft Azure cloud infrastructure as well as social engineering schemes to\n**disseminate two unique backdoors: MINIBIKE and MINIBUS.**\n\nThis blog post details the suspected UNC1549 operations since June 2022, the ongoing development of their\nproprietary malware, their network of over 125 Azure command-and-control (C2) subdomains, and their attack\nlifecycle, which includes tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) Mandiant has not previously seen deployed by\nIran.\n\n## Attribution\n\n[Mandiant assesses with moderate confidence that this activity has ties to UNC1549, an Iran-based espionage group,](https://advantage.mandiant.com/actors/threat-actor--9821c7e2-4bc7-59f5-8fe6-a56a1957fa91)\nwhich overlaps with activities publicly known as [Tortoiseshell and Smoke Sandstorm/BOHRIUM.](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Meta-Quarterly-Adversarial-Threat-Report_Q1-2022.pdf)\n\nNamely, a fake recruiting website (1stemployer[.]com) was observed hosting a MINIBUS payload in November 2023.\nThe template used for the fake recruiting website had been used previously in another fake recruiting website,\ncareers-finder[.]com, which was used by UNC1549.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn this campaign, the MINIBUS backdoor was hosted on a fake job website (1stemployer[.]com) using the exact\nsame written contents as careers-finder[.]com used by UNC1549 in early 2022, for example, “After considering\nthe career and education background we introduce you to the employer companies which are looking for the\nindicated skills and expertise.”\n\nFigure 1: Fake job website 1stemployer[.]com deploying a template similar to a previous UNC1549\n\nwebsite\n\nIn addition, like in previous UNC1549 activities, this campaign leveraged .NET applications to deliver the\nmalware—this time the attackers implemented it by using a fake Hamas-affiliated application to deliver the\nMINIBUS backdoor.\n\n**According to public** **[reporting, Tortoiseshell, which is tied to UNC1549, is potentially linked to the IRGC.](https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-iran-espionage-catfishing-us-military/)**\n\nIn addition, the focused targeting of Middle East entities affiliated with the aerospace and defense sectors is\n**consistent with other Iran-nexus clusters of activity, some of which are affiliated with the IRGC as well.**\n\n## Outlook and Implications\n\nMandiant research indicates this campaign remains active as of February 2024, and targeted entities are related to\ndefense, aerospace, and aviation in the Middle East, particularly in Israel and the UAE and potentially in Turkey,\nIndia, and Albania.\n\nThe intelligence collected on these entities is of relevance to strategic Iranian interests and may be leveraged for\nespionage as well as kinetic operations. This is further supported by the potential ties between UNC1549 and the\nIRGC.\n\nThe evasion methods deployed in this campaign, namely the tailored job-themed lures combined with the use of\ncloud infrastructure for C2, may make it challenging for network defenders to prevent, detect, and mitigate this\nactivity. The intelligence and indicators provided in this report may support these efforts and enhance them.\n\n## Attack Lifecycle\n\nThis suspected UNC1549 campaign uses two primary methods to achieve initial access to the targets: spearphishing and credential harvesting. A typical chain of attack consists of several stages:\n\n\n-----\n\n1. Spear-phishing emails or social media correspondence, disseminating links to fake websites containing\n\n**Israel-Hamas related content or fake job offers. The websites would eventually lead to downloading a**\nmalicious payload.\n\nFigure 2: Fake website posing as the “Bring Them Home Now” movement, calling for the return of\n\nIsraelis kidnapped by Hamas\n\nThe fake job offers were for tech and defense-related positions, specifically in the aviation, aerospace,\nor thermal imaging sectors.\nMandiant also observed some of the fake job websites that hosted malicious payloads were also used\nduring 2023 to harvest credentials.\n\nFigure 3: Fake login page masquerading as the aerospace company Boeing\n\n\n-----\n\n2. Payload delivery, downloaded from the previously mentioned websites to the target’s computer. The payload\n\nis a compressed archive that typically includes two main bundles:\n\nMINIBIKE or MINIBUS—two unique backdoors deployed at least since 2022 (MINIBIKE) and 2023\n(MINIBUS), providing full backdoor functionality (see the Technical Appendix for more information).\nA benign lure in the form of an application like OneDrive (MINIBIKE) or, in the case of MINIBUS, a custom\napplication presenting content related to Israelis kidnapped by Hamas hosted on the fake website\nbirngthemhomenow[.]co[.]il mentioned previously.\n\nFigure 4: Decoy content used by MINIBUS, related to the “Bring Them Home Now”\n\nmovement\n\n3. Payload installation and device compromise, achieved after the MINIBIKE or MINIBUS backdoors establish\n\nC2 communication, in most cases via Microsoft Azure cloud infrastructure.\n\nThe access to the device can be leveraged for multiple purposes, including intelligence collection and as\na stepping stone for further access into the targeted network.\nThis stage may be supported by the use of LIGHTRAIL, a unique tunneler used in the campaign (see the\nfollowing details).\n\nThis suspected UNC1549 campaign deployed several evasion techniques to mask their activity:\n\nAbusing Microsoft Azure infrastructure for C2 and hosting, making it difficult to discern the activity from\nlegitimate network traffic. In some cases, servers geolocated in the targeted countries (Israel and the UAE)\nwere used, further masking the activity.\nUsing domain naming schemes that include strings that would likely seem legitimate to network defenders, like\ncountries, organizations names, languages or descriptions related to the targeted sector. Following are several\nexamples of indicative Azure domains:\n\n**ilengineeringrssfeed[.]azurewebsites[.]net (“IL Engineering RSS Feed”)**\nhiringarabicregion[.]azurewebsites[.]net (“Hiring Arabic Region”)\n**turkairline[.]azurewebsites[.]net (“Turk Airline”)**\n\n\n-----\n\nUsing job-themed lures, offering various IT and tech-related positions, which are likely to be disseminated\nlegitimately. One of these fake job offers is presented in Figure 5.\n\nFigure 5: Fake job offer on behalf of DJI, a drone manufacturing company (MD5:\n\n4a223bc9c6096ac6bae3e7452ed6a1cd)\n\n## Malware Families\n\nMandiant observed the following custom malware families used in the suspected UNC1549 activity.\n\n\n**Malware**\n**Family**\n\n\n**Description** **First Seen** **Last**\n**Seen**\n\n\nMINIBIKE A custom backdoor written in C++ capable of file exfiltration and\nupload, command execution, and more. Communicates using Azure\ncloud infrastructure.\n\nMINIBUS A custom backdoor that provides a more flexible code-execution\ninterface and enhanced reconnaissance features compared to\nMINIBIKE\n\nLIGHTRAIL A tunneler, likely based on an open-source Socks4a proxy, that\ncommunicates using Azure cloud infrastructure\n\n\nJune 2022 October\n2023\n\nAugust 2023 January\n2024\n\n\nNovember\n2022\n\n\nAugust\n2023\n\n\n-----\n\n## MINIBIKE: When Cats Fly (Under the Radar)\n\nMINIBIKE is a custom malware written in C++, used since at least June 2022. Once MINIBIKE is installed, it provides\na full backdoor functionality, including directory and file enumeration, collection of system files and information,\nuploading files, and running additional processes.\n\nThe MINIBIKE platform usually consists of three utilities bundled in an archive, delivered via spear phishing:\n\n1. The MINIBIKE backdoor, usually in the form of a .dll or a .dat file\n2. A launcher, executed via search-order-hijacking (SoH), deploying MINIBIKE and setting its persistence using\n\nregistry keys\n3. A legitimate/fake executable, used to mask the malicious MINIBIKE deployment. Mandiant observed different\n\nMINIBIKE versions use three applications for this purpose: Microsoft SharePoint, Microsoft OneDrive, and a\nfake Hamas-related .NET application.\n\nThe MINIBIKE platform has been in use since at least June 2022, gradually being developed to several versions\ndistinct from each other in lures, features, and functionality. While Mandiant did not observe any embedded version\nnumbers, the **MINIBIKE instances can be divided to the following versions.**\n\n**Ver.** **Date** **Changes (Compared to Earlier Version)** **Geographies** **Example MD5**\n\n\n1.0 June 2022 - First version\n\n              - C2 server geolocated in Iran (not Azure)\n\n             - Submitted to a public malware repository from\nIran\n\n              - Legitimate SharePoint installation as a lure\n\n             - Bundled in an IMG drive (“Screenshot.img”)\n\n             - Export DLL name: “update.dll”\n\n\n1.1 October–\nNovember 2022\n\n\n\n- First use of Azure subdomains for C2 - Three\nembedded, only one used\n\n- First use of OneDrive installation as a lure and\nas a registry key for persistence\n\n- Export DLL name: “Mini.dll”\n\n\nIran adef679c6aa6860a\na89b775dceb6958b\n\nUAE, Turkey 409c2ac789015e76\nf9886f1203a73bc0\n\nIsrael, UAE 691d0143c0642ff7\n83909f983ccb8ffd\n\n\n2.0 August 2023 - Three to five Azure C2 domains used\nsubsequently in a loop\n\n             - Bundled in a ZIP file (“Survey.zip”)\n\n              - Additional obfuscation\n\n             - Additional functionality and commands\n\n             - Export DLL name: “Mini-Junked.dll”\n\n\n-----\n\n2.1 August 2023 - Uses “Image Photo Viewer“ registry key for\npersistence\n\n              - Additional obfuscation\n\n            - Three Azure C2 domains\n\n\nIsrael, India e3dc8810da71812b\n860fc59aeadcc350\n\nIsrael, UAE 054c67236a86d9ab\n5ec80e16b884f733\n\n\n2.2 August–October\n2023\n\n\n\n- Four Azure C2 domains\n\n- Reverts back to OneDrive registry key for\npersistence\n\n- Additional functionality and commands\n\n- Additional obfuscation\n\n- Beacon communication looping over three\n“files”: index.html, favicon.ico, icon.svg\n\n- Export DLL name: “Micro.dll”\n\n\n## MINIBUS: A RoBUSt Successor?\n\nMandiant observed a second backdoor deployed in this campaign, which bears multiple similarities to MINIBIKE and\nwas therefore named MINIBUS. The MINIBUS platform has been used since at least August 2023, likely during the\nsame time as the latest MINIBIKE versions, though not necessarily to target the same victims.\n\n**MINIBUS is a more advanced, updated platform when compared to MINIBIKE. While similar in functionality and**\ncode base, MINIBUS contains fewer built-in features and a more flexible code-execution and command\n**interface in addition to more advanced reconnaissance features.**\n\nThis might make the MINIBUS platform a more suitable option for an experienced operator, which instead of using\nready-to-use features may require a more flexible platform. Such an operator may be concerned with operational\nsecurity (OpSec), possibly as an early stage in a more elaborate operation.\n\nFollowing is a more detailed list of the key differences between the MINIBIKE and MINIBUS platforms.\n\n### Functionality\n\nMINIBUS has fewer built-in commands and features when compared with MINIBIKE. Instead, MINIBUS\nprovides a more flexible code-execution and command interface, including the ability to run an executable (for\nexample, a possible next-stage implant) using a single command, unlike MINIBIKE.\nMINIBUS has a process enumeration feature. A process list generated by MINIBUS may be useful to avoid\ndetection, for example, by identifying processes related to Virtual Machine (VM) utilities or security applications\n(such as an EDR).\n\n### Export DLL Names\n\nThe MINIBUS bundle contains DLLs with the names “torvaldinitial.dll” for its launcher/installer and\n“torvaldspersist.dll” for its payload, unlike MINIBIKE, which utilizes export DLL names like “Dr2.dll” or\n“MspUpdate.dll” (for its launchers) and “Mini-Junked.dll” or “Micro.dll” (for its payloads).\n\n### C2 Communication\n\nMINIBUS uses a combination of an Azure subdomain and unique *.com domains for C2 communications, unlike\nMINIBIKE, which relies only on Azure infrastructure.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Lures and Themes\n\n**MINIBUS deployed lures related to the Israel-Hamas war, including a fake .NET application with themes and**\ncontents abusing the “Bring Them Home Now” movement, which calls for the return of the Israeli hostages\nkidnapped by Hamas. In another MINIBUS instance, Mandiant observed a lure related to Quizora, possibly referring\nto a quiz application.\n\n### Targeting and Geography\n\nLike MINIBIKE, Mandiant observed MINIBUS targeting Israel and possibly India and the UAE. In addition, a\nMINIBUS C2 domain (cashcloudservices[.]com) had a subdomain with the prefix nsalbaniahack[.]*, suggesting an\n**interest in Albania as well, which is consistent with Iran interests but not yet observed in a MINIBIKE-related**\nactivity.\n\n## LIGHTRAIL: Highway to Where?\n\nIn addition to the MINIBIKE and MINIBUS backdoors, Mandiant observed a tunneler named LIGHTRAIL likely\naffiliated with UNC1549 as well.\n\nLIGHTRAIL has several connections to MINIBIKE and MINIBUS in the form of (1) a shared code base, (2) Azure C2\ninfrastructure with similar patterns and naming, and (3) overlapping targets and victimology.\n\nLIGHTRAIL communicates with an Azure C2 subdomain of the form\n_*[.]*[.]cloudapp[.]azure[.]com. Mandiant assesses with medium confidence that both LIGHTRAIL and MINIBIKE were_\nused to target the same victim environment at least once.\n\n[LIGHTRAIL likely leverages the open-source utility “Lastenzug” (“freight train” in German), a Socks4a proxy based](https://github.com/codewhitesec/Lastenzug)\non websockets with a “static obfuscation on [the] assembly level.” LIGHTRAIL’s export DLL is named “lastenzug.dll,”\nand it shares the same hard-coded User Agent as Lastenzug.\n\nMozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/42.0.2311.135 Safari/537.36\nEdge/12.10136\n\nMandiant observed two LIGHTRAIL versions used at least since November 2022. Similarly to MINIBIKE, no “official”\nversions were embedded in LIGHTRAIL’s code, but the instances can be divided to two versions.\n\n**Ver.** **Date** **Changes (Compared to Earlier Version)** **Geographies** **Example MD5**\n\n\n1.0 November\n2022\n\n2.0 August\n2023\n\n\n\n- C2 domains:\ntnlsowki[.]westus3[.]cloudapp[.]azure[.]com\n\ntnlsowkis[.]westus3[.]cloudapp[.]azure[.]com\n\n- Export DLL named “lastenzug.dll”, likely\n[referring to the open-source Socks4a proxy](https://github.com/codewhitesec/Lastenzug)\n\n- C2 domain:\niaidevrssfeed[.]centralus[.]cloudapp[.]azure[.]com\n\n- Export DLL named “Lastenzug.dll” (capital ‘L’)\n\n- String obfuscation, similar to MINIBIKE\n\n\nTurkey 36e2d9ce19ed045a9840313439d6f18d\n\nIsrael a5fdf55c1c50be471946de937f1e46dd\n\n\n-----\n\n## Credential Harvesting and Fake Job Offers\n\nMandiant observed that several websites hosting MINIBIKE payloads also hosted fake login pages in mid-2023\nposing as job offers on behalf of legitimate defense and technology-related companies. More specifically, the\ncompanies were affiliated with the aerospace, aviation, and thermal imaging industries.\n\nFigure 6: Fake login page masquerading as the aerospace company Boeing\n\nFigure 7: Fake login page masquerading as Teledyne FLIR, a manufacturer of thermal imaging devices\n\nIn addition, Mandiant observed suspected UNC1549 infrastructure hosting job description documents for positions in\nDJI, a drone manufacturing company, in parallel to a MINIBIKE .zip file.\n\nThe documents were likely used as lures in social engineering efforts, either for running malicious files or harvesting\ncredentials.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8: Fake DJI job offer (MD5: 4a223bc9c6096ac6bae3e7452ed6a1cd)\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 9: Fake DJI job offer (MD5: ec6a0434b94f51aa1df76a066aa05413)\n\n## Technical Appendix\n\n### MINIBIKE Technical Analysis\n\nMandiant observed the following versions of MINIBIKE deployed since 2022.\n\n**Version 1.x, June–November 2022**\n\n**Payload: IMG archive named Screenshot.img (example MD5: 409c2ac789015e76f9886f1203a73bc0),**\ncontaining the following files:\n\nScreenshots.lnk - a launcher LNK file (MD5: cb565b1bb128dfc20c8392974ff73e3f)\nSetup.exe - a legitimate OneDrive/SharePoint executable (MD5: 400d7190012517677dd5ef2e471f2cd1)\nsecur32.dll - the MINIBIKE launcher, executed via search-order-hijacking (SoH) (MD5:\n54848d17aa76d807e2fd6d196a01ce84)\nconfigur.dll - the MINIBIKE backdoor (MD5: e9ed595b24a7eeb34ac52f57eeec6e2b)\n\n**Note: Most of the following analysis refers to version 1.0, but version 1.1 behaves in a similar manner.**\n\n**Execution: once the IMG archive is mounted, the malicious launcher is executed via SoH and copies the**\nlegitimate executable and the MINIBIKE backdoor to the following paths:\n\n**Legitimate executable: %LOCALAPPDATA%\\Microsoft\\OneDrive\\configs\\FileCoAuth.exe**\n**MINIBIKE backdoor: %LOCALAPPDATA%\\Microsoft\\OneDrive\\configs\\secur32.dll**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Persistence: The loader/installer sets persistence for the MINIBIKE payload by moving it to its staging**\ndirectory and setting the following Run registry key:\n\n**Key: HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\OneDriveFileCoAuth.exe**\n**Value: %LOCALAPPDATA%\\Microsoft\\OneDrive\\configs\\FileCoAuth.exe**\n**Export DLL name:**\n\n**Version 1.0: “update.dll”**\n**Version 1.1:“Mini.dll”**\n**User Agent:**\n\n**Version 1.0: Mozilla/5.0 (Linux;
