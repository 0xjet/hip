The app is not on Google Play, but it is itself a quite a popular app store around\nthe world. Most likely, its infection is a repeat of the [CamScanner incident, when the](https://securelist.com/dropper-in-google-play/92496/)\ndeveloper implemented a new adware SDK from an unverified source.\n\nWe notified the developers about the infection on April 8. APKPure confirmed the issue and\npromptly fixed it with the release of version 3.17.19.\n\nIn terms of functionality, the malicious code embedded in APKPure is standard for this type\nof threat. When the app starts, the payload is decrypted and launched. In this case, it is\nlocated in a long string in the app code.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe payload collects information about the user device and sends it to the C&C server.\n\nNext, depending on the response received, the malware can:\n\nShow ads when the device is unlocked.\n\nOpen browser pages with ads repeatedly.\n\nLoad additional executable modules.\n\n\n-----\n\n[In our case, a Trojan was loaded that has much in common with the notorious Triada](https://securelist.com/attack-on-zygote-a-new-twist-in-the-evolution-of-mobile-threats/74032/)\nmalware and can perform a range of actions: from displaying and clicking ads to signing up\nfor paid subscriptions and downloading other malware.\n\nDepending on the OS version, the Trojan can inflict various forms of damage on the victim.\nAPKPure users with current Android versions mostly risk having paid subscriptions and\nintrusive ads appear from nowhere. Users of smartphones who do not receive security\nupdates are less fortunate: in outdated versions of the OS, the malware is capable of not\nonly loading additional apps, but installing them on the system partition. This can result in an\n[unremovable Trojan like xHelper getting onto the device.](https://securelist.com/unkillable-xhelper-and-a-trojan-matryoshka/96487/)\n\n\n-----\n\nKaspersky solutions detect the malicious implant as HEUR:TrojanDropper.AndroidOS.Triada.ap.\n\nIf you use APKPure, we recommend immediately deleting the infected app and installing the\n“clean” 3.17.19 version. In addition, scan the system for other Trojans using a reliable\n[security solution, such as Kaspersky Internet Security for Android.](https://www.kaspersky.com/android-security)\n\n## IOCs\n\nAPKPure app\n\n[2cfaedcf879c62f5a50b42cbb0a7a499](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/2cfaedcf879c62f5a50b42cbb0a7a499/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\n[718aecd85e9f1219f3fc05ef156d3acf](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/718aecd85e9f1219f3fc05ef156d3acf/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\n[ceac990b3df466c0d23e0b7f588d1407](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/ceac990b3df466c0d23e0b7f588d1407/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\n[deac06ab75be80339c034e266dddbc9f](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/deac06ab75be80339c034e266dddbc9f/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\n[f64d43c64b8a39313409db2c846b3ee9](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/f64d43c64b8a39313409db2c846b3ee9/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\nPayload\n\n[31e49ac1902b415e6716bc3fb048f381](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/31e49ac1902b415e6716bc3fb048f381/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\nDownloaded malware\n\n[5f9085a5e5e17cb1f6e387a901e765cf](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/5f9085a5e5e17cb1f6e387a901e765cf/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\nC&C\n\n[https://wcf.seven1029[.]com](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/wcf.seven1029.com/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\n[http://foodin[.]site/UploadFiles/20210406052812.apk](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/foodin.site%2FUploadFiles%2F20210406052812.apk/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\n[Code injection](https://securelist.com/tag/code-injection/)\n[Google Android](https://securelist.com/tag/google-android/)\n[Malware Technologies](https://securelist.com/tag/malware-technologies/)\n[Trojan](https://securelist.com/tag/trojan/)\n\nAuthors\n\nIgor Golovin\n\nAnton Kivva\n\nMalicious code in APKPure app\n\n\n-----\n\nYour email address will not be published.
