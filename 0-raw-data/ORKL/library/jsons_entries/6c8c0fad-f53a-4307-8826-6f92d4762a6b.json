Based on\nour analysis, we conclude the attempts made by this actor demonstrate continued targeting\nof human rights groups and activists related to advocacy of human rights in North Korea. In\naddition, we are continually observing this actor utilise the compromising of legitimate\nbusiness websites to host their phishing kits. We believe this to be a result of either\ncomprising of the original website developer’s infrastructure, or exploitation of the web\nservers themselves. We have found that the actor is a motivated, well-resourced advanced\npersistent threat with motivations that relate closely to those demonstrated by hostile threat\ngroups based in North Korea. The targeted threats by this group closely align with the\n\n\n-----\n\nmission of North Korea s foreign intelligence service, Reconnaissance General Bureau\n(RGB). This cluster overlaps with that of ESTSecurity’s cluster which they call “Kumsong\n121”.\n\nIt should be noted that there are many overlaps between UCID902 and threat group\n“Kimsuky” in regards to TTPs, motivations and modus operandi (MO), however, at the time of\nwriting this, we have yet to see this activity group fall into our cluster for Kimsuky.\n\nIn this report we will highlight two events from our cluster that demonstrate the activity and\nattack campaigns lead by UCID902.\n\nOn 2023-03-17, Interlab received a sample from an NGO that supports North Korean\nrefugees. We found that this phishing campaign used a KISA Security Notification\nemail as a lure, synonymous with historical campaigns (example:\n\nhttps://www.dailynk.com/20210510-3/). In addition, the phishing page mimicked that of\na Naver login page, which was hosted on a legitimate Law Firm’s website, resulting in a\nwatering hole attack. The same web server IP, hosting the Law Firm’s website, was\nalso seen mimicking a Naver login page on 2023-01-27 on a Child Education website;\nwhich we saw involved in a targeted credential harvesting campaign against a Korean\nUniversity professor. Both these sites were developed by the same developer and\nhosted on that developer’s webserver. The web developer was a company based in\nSeoul.\nOn 2023-01-25, Interlab received a sample from an activist based in South Korea who\nworks on North Korean human rights. This campaign used a Naver alert message as\nan email lure, and directed the victim to a fake Naver login page hosted on a legitimate\nMedical Research Institutions website, indicating a watering hole attack. The server IP\nof this website was also seen on three other separate watering hole attacks we\ntracked. All three occasions saw credential harvesting campaigns targeting victims\nrelated to the MO of UCID902. These campaigns were also hosting Naver login pages.\nThe websites used in the watering hole attacks described above were four differing\nMedical Research Institutions, which all shared the same web development company\nand server IP address.\n\n## Understanding UCID902’s credential harvesting operation\n\nWe first observed UCID902 on 2021-07-12 delivering credential phishing campaigns to\nactivists based in the Republic of Korea. The lures aimed to appear as Naver security alerts,\nprompting users to input credentials, as seen in Figure 1. From 2021 to 2023, we have seen\ncontinued efforts by UCID902 to compromise credentials from victims with the same lures\nand phishing kits. These lures all are synonymous with Naver security events or similar.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1 First lure observation of UCID902 by Interlab in 2021_\nThroughout this time, Interlab has made direct correlations within subsequent campaigns by\nUCID902 between events in both infrastructure (IP addresses, domains and SMTP hosts),\ncapabilities (phishing kit) & victimology. In addition, and most notability, the actor relies\nheavily on watering hole attacks by compromising legitimate organisations within Korea to\nhost phishing pages. These organisations appear to be legitimate businesses or institutions\nwith a diverse range of industries. However, it is not the organisations themselves that relate,\nbut the hosting provider. Throughout our tracking, we have identified many campaigns where\nphishing kits were hosted on legitimate company websites indicating a compromise of the\nwebsite; all of these websites, within specific time windows, were hosted by the same\n\n\n-----\n\nhosting provider or hosted IP. In recent campaigns, late 2022 to early 2023, we saw constant\nusage of phishing kits hosted on websites built by one specific hosting provider based in\nSeoul, Republic of Korea. One notable characteristic of the phish kit we have observed\n**is that it will verify that originating client has visited the page via a common user-**\n**agent and residential IP – if it doesn’t it will redirect to the legitimate Naver login page. As a**\nresult of this methodology, with medium to high confidence, we conclude that one of\n**UCID902’s attack credential comprise methodology appears as this attack path**\ndemonstrated in Figure 2 as of 2023-03-17. We would like industry partners and\ngovernmental support to validate and understand this attack method, in order to defend the\nhuman rights ecosphere from this threat actor. Because of this, we welcome and encourage\nindustry or governmental contribution or enrichment to this intelligence.\n\n_Figure 2_\n\n_UCID902's credential watering hole attack pattern_\nHistorically, we have seen more generic campaigns targeting Naver users, to which this\nactor’s phish kits can often appear like. However, our first indication that this actor shares\npolitical and operational motivations as threat actors based in North Korea, began in early\n2022. We observed with high confidence specific infrastructure and capability\n**correlations with a campaign targeting activists with lures masquerading as The**\n**Ministry of Unification. This campaign included a malicious HWP document which we**\nidentified with correlations to campaigns led by APT group Kimsuky. It should be noted that\nthis infrastructure overlap is not a common feature within our UCID902 cluster, resulting in\nthese specific correlations being notable findings in understanding UCID902’s scope. Thus,\nwe note that the socio-political axis of this actor closely overlaps with motivations by known\nthreat groups based in North Korea.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3 Lure with content title as journal of South-North Korea Relation observed in 2022_\n_targeting the same activists,_\n\n_with infrastructure and capability overlap with other UCID902 credential harvesting_\n_campaigns_\nDue to the infrastructure, capabilities, modus operandi, victimology and other meta-features,\nwe believe with confidence that the threat group we classify as UCID902 are an advanced\npersistent threat focused on compromising credentials of activists working on North Korean\nhuman rights related activities and the unification of Korea. It should also be noted that many\nof the spear-phishing lures contained in campaigns led by UCID902 relate specifically to\nNorth Korean activities that would be of interest by the victims. A highly motivated actor such\n\n\n-----\n\nas this demonstrates many hallmarks of a threat group based in North Korea, however at this\ntime we should note that we do not have enough data points correlating to other known\nthreat groups, such as Kimsuky, to affirm with confidence if this operation is led by them.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4 Lure by UCID902 observed targeting activist on 2023-01-25 with content title as job_\n_posting of professor position from graduate school of North Korea studies_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe phish kits observed in campaigns lead by UCID902 do not appear to differ throughout\nour observations since 2021. Across our cluster, we have indexed DOM content of all\nphishing sites observed in these campaigns, resulting in all of them correlating with each\nother. In the phishing email, the URI (contained as a link on the green button displayed in\nFigure 4) contains two values that determine the targeted and the redirect. We have\nidentified a specific encoding which the actor utilises to encode the request query\nparameters, which we have seen throughout campaigns lead by UCID902. When the user\ninputs credentials on the phish kit, we note the credentials are send in a POST request back\nto the comprised hosting webserver. If the originating GET request doesn’t meet\nrequirements or contain the victim identifier, the user is redirected to a different website\n(figure 5).\n\n_Figure 5 Example of redirection from the phishing kit when validation checks aren't valid_\nIn addition, throughout campaigns lead by UCID902, email headers within the spear-phishing\ncampaigns often showed the SMTP mail originating from the same infrastructure as the\nphishing kit and sender address containing a domain owned by the web development\ncompany.\n\nThreat intelligence\n\nInterlab wish to share the threat intelligence we have collected on UCID902 as soon as\npossible to defend and help those at risk from this actor. We will do this once we have\n**identified that the hosting companies we have reported to KISA are safely secured.**\n\nIf you are part of an NGO, civil society organization or other group and believe that you have\nbeen targeted by a threat actor and wish to seek help or understand more about this targeted\nthreat, please reach out to us.\n\nIn the meantime, we will update this page with the threat intelligence we can share in due\ncourse.\n\nConclusion\n\n\n-----\n\nAs part of our Targeted Threats research campaign, Interlab will continue to monitor attack\ncampaigns from hostile governments to human rights activists within Korea and across the\nglobe. We believe UCID902 to be an advanced persistent threat to the human rights\ncommunity in Korea and will continue to monitor and support victims of this group.\n\nWe aim to support those at risk from targeted threats and share research to provide effective\nand actionable change to both digital security of civic organisations in Korea, East Asia and\nby outgrowth to global communities.\n\nInterlab is a non-profit organization based in Seoul with a mission to create a resilient digital\nsafety net for the freedom of citizens, providing free digital security consultations, trainings,\nincident response support and research of cyber threats toward civic society.\n\nFor any inquiries regarding on this report, please reach us through contact@interlab.or.kr\n\n\n-----",
