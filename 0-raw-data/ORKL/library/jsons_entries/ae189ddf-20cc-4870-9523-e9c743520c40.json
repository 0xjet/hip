The campaigns, which are distributed across a](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/threat-actor-profile-ta505-dridex-globeimposter)\nwide range of industries, started with low volume email waves that ramped up in late\nSeptember, resulting in tens to hundreds of thousands of emails.\n\nMany of the campaigns, especially the large volume ones, strongly resemble the historic\nTA505 activity from 2019 and 2020. The commonalities include similar domain naming\nconventions, email lures, Excel file lures, and the delivery of the FlawedGrace remote access\ntrojan (RAT). The campaigns also contain some noteworthy, new developments, such as\nretooled intermediate loader stages scripted in Rebol and KiXtart, which are used instead of\nthe previously popular Get2 downloader. The new downloaders perform similar functionality\nof reconnaissance and pulling in the next stages. Lastly, there is an updated version of\nFlawedGrace.\n\n## Evolving Campaigns\n\n\n-----\n\nThe initial campaigns observed by Proofpoint in September 2021 were comparatively small\nin volume, several thousand emails per wave, and delivered malicious Excel attachments. In\nlate September and in early October 2021 this changed, and TA505 began sending higher\nemail volumes, tens to hundreds of thousands, to more industries. Additionally, the actor\nbegan leveraging both URL and attachment-based email campaigns and diversified from\ntargeting predominantly North America to also targeting German-speaking countries,\nincluding Germany and Austria.\n\n## September 2021 Campaigns\n\nThe early campaigns identified by Proofpoint in September 2021 were low volume compared\nto typical TA505 activity, with only several thousand messages per wave. TA505 used more\nspecific lures that did not affect as many industries as the more recent October 2021\ncampaigns. Example lures included legal, media release, situation report, and health claim\nthemes. These early campaigns also largely focused on targets in North America, such as\nUnited States and Canada.\n\nThe emails contained an Excel attachment that, when opened and macros enabled, would\nlead to the download and running of an MSI file. The MSI file in turn would execute an\nembedded Rebol loader, dubbed by Proofpoint as MirrorBlast.\n\n_Figure 1. Email purporting to be from an insurance claims analyst, part of the September 28,_\n_2021 campaign._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2. The insurance claim Excel attachment, part of the September 28, 2021 campaign._\n\n## October 2021 Campaigns\n\nIn late September and throughout October 2021, Proofpoint observed a shift to familiar\nTA505 tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that are reminiscent of the actor’s 2019\nand 2020 campaigns. An additional intermediary loader scripted in KiXtart was introduced,\nand the attack chain evolved to the following:\n\nAn email containing one of the below:\n\nExcel attachment\nHTML attachment that links to the download of an Excel file\nURL linking to a landing page that redirects to the download of an Excel file\nURL directly linking to an Excel file\nThe Excel file macros download and run an MSI file\nThe MSI file executes an embedded KiXtart loader\nThe KiXtart loader receives a command from the C&C server to download another MSI\nfile that executes MirrorBlast\nMirrorBlast then downloads additional Rebol script stagers\nThe follow-on Rebol stagers drop ReflectiveGnome\nReflectiveGnome in turn downloads more shellcode, that will then drop and detonate\nFlawedGrace\n\nThe email lures moved away from the detailed lures seen initially in this spate of campaigns.\nThey became more generic, with subjects such as “SECUREFILE,” “SECURE DOCUMENT,”\nand “You’ve been sent a secure message.” Additionally, the themes and abused brands\n\n\n-----\n\nincluded COVID-19, DocuSign, insurance, invoices, and Microsoft.\n\n_Figure 3. October 13, 2021 German-language email using a OneDrive shared file lure._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4. October 13, 2021 landing page abusing Microsoft and OneDrive branding._\n\n_Figure 5. Excel file used in the October 13, 2021 campaign with a simple green lure._\n\n\n-----\n\n## Similarities to Historic TA505 Activity\n\nThere is much similarity between the new and historic TA505 campaigns, starting with the\n**emails.**\n\n_Figure 6. The OneDrive shared file email lure used in August 21, 2020 (left) strongly_\n_resembles a similar email from October 7, 2021 (right). Note the additional use of a COVID-_\n_19 theme in the recent campaign._\n\nThe landing pages in historic and current TA505 campaigns contain “IP Logger” links that\nlikely enable TA505 to track the IP addresses of the machines downloading the malicious\nfiles. Additionally, TA505 is still mimicking file hosting services in the landing pages.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7. The landing page used in a November 21, 2019 campaign is shown on the left,_\n_while the landing page used in the October 7, 2021 campaign is shown on the right._\n\nWhile the Excel macros VBA code in the recent TA505 campaigns is different, some of the\n**Excel graphic lures are similar or identical to those previously used by TA505.**\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8. The Excel sheet lure spoofing Microsoft logos remained identical from September_\n_2, 2020 (Left) to October 6, 2021 (Right)._\n\n**Domain naming conventions: It is also notable that TA505 has historically used domains**\nthat mimic various file hosting service providers and structured them in formats with hyphen\nseparated terms. The domains used in late September 2021 and onward follow this\nstructure.\n\n**Code reuse: Proofpoint researchers found code reuse in parts of the delivery chain such as**\n[in multiple parts of the landing page (see an example mentioned here).](https://twitter.com/stoerchl/status/1448561662181658628)\n\n## Excel Macros Analysis\n\nFor TA505’s 2021 campaigns to be successful, potential victims must enable macros after\nopening the malicious Excel files. The code responsible for downloading the next stage MSI\nfile was typically lightly obfuscated with filler characters, string reversing or similar simple\nfunctions and hidden in the document Comments, Title, in a Cell or other locations.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 9. Example Excel macros code._\n\n_Figure 10. The parameters Subject and Comments are stored in the workbook properties._\n\n_Figure 11. Deobfuscated downloader JScript. This pulls the next stage—an MSI file._\n\n\n-----\n\n## Intermediate Loaders\n\nTA505 now uses multiple intermediate loaders before the delivery of the FlawedGrace RAT.\nThe new loader stages are coded in uncommon scripting languages—Rebol and KiXtart.\n[They appear to serve the same purpose as Get2—a downloader that has been in use by](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/ta505-distributes-new-sdbbot-remote-access-trojan-get2-downloader)\nTA505 since 2019 to deliver a variety of secondary payloads. The loaders perform minimal\nreconnaissance of an infected machine, such as collecting user domain and username\ninformation, and download further payloads.\n\n_Figure 12. Attack paths ultimately leading to FlawedGrace._\n\nIn the attack chain, the Excel macros download the first MSI file, which executes the first\nloader, encoded in KiXtart scripting language. The KiXtart interpreter then receives a\ncommand from the C&C server to download a follow-on MSI package. Of note, KiXtart loader\nis not always part of the attack chain. The second MSI package contains multiple files that\nmay have different names, for example, AudioDriver.exe (the Rebol interpreter),\nAudioDriver.exe.lnk (command that informs .ico execution), and image.ico (the Rebol script).\nThis Rebol script is the second new downloader in the chain, that Proofpoint dubbed\nMirrorBlast.\n\n_Figure 13. Example of MirrorBlast script, it may be slightly different in different campaigns._\n\n\n-----\n\nMirrorBlast in turn downloads additional Rebol script stagers that execute simple\ndownloaders, dubbed by Proofpoint as ReflectiveGnome. ReflectiveGnome in turn\ndownloads more shellcode, that will then drop and detonate FlawedGrace.\n\n_Figure 14. Rebol script downloaded by MirrorBlast that drops ReflectiveGnome loader (dwm-_\n_x64.exe / dwm-x32.exe)._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 15. ReflectiveGnome loader which executes the next stage as a shellcode._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 16. This shellcode drops and detonates an updated FlawedGrace._\n\n## Updated FlawedGrace RAT\n\n[Proofpoint researchers first observed FlawedGrace in November 2017. It is a full-featured](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/servhelper-and-flawedgrace-new-malware-introduced-ta505)\nRAT written in C++ that can receive the following commands from its C&C via a custom\nbinary protocol on TCP port 443:\n\ntarget_remove\ntarget_update\ntarget_reboot\ntarget_module_load\ntarget_module_load_external\ntarget_module_unload\ntarget_download\ntarget_upload\ntarget_rdp\ntarget_passwords\n\n\n-----\n\ntarget_servers\ntarget_script\ndestroy_os\ndesktop_stat\n\nWhile Proofpoint researchers are still investigating the updates to this version of\nFlawedGrace, some notable changes include:\n\nEncrypted strings\nObfuscated API calls\nConfiguration is now stored as an encrypted resource (initial/default config), then it is\nstored both in a mapped memory region (current configuration instance) and in the\nregistry (persistence)\n\n## Attribution\n\nProofpoint attributes the campaigns discussed in this blog to TA505 with high confidence.\nProofpoint's assessment that TA505 is responsible for this renewed activity is based on the\naforementioned similarities between historic TA505 campaigns and this new activity,\nincluding, but not limited to, code similarities, domain naming patterns and the use of\nFlawedGrace, which has been almost exclusively linked to TA505 activity.\n\n## Outlook\n\nTA505 is an established threat actor that is financially motivated and known for conducting\nmalicious email campaigns on a previously unprecedented scale. The group regularly\n[changes their TTPs and are considered trendsetters in the world of cybercrime. This threat](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/servhelper-and-flawedgrace-new-malware-introduced-ta505)\nactor does not limit its target set, and is, in fact, an equal opportunist with the geographies\nand verticals it chooses to attack. This combined with TA505’s ability to be flexible, focusing\non what is the most lucrative and shifting its TTPs as necessary, make the actor a continued\nthreat.\n\nProofpoint researchers expect TA505 to continue to adjust its operations and methods\nalways with an eye to financial gain. Using intermediate loaders in its attack chain is also\nlikely to become a longer-term technique employed by the threat actor.\n\n**EmergingThreats Detection Rules**\n\n2034012 - ET TROJAN MirrorBlast Checkin (trojan.rules)\n\n2034022 - ET TROJAN MirrorBlast CnC Activity M2 (trojan.rules)\n\n2034023 - ET TROJAN MirrorBlast CnC Activity M3 (trojan.rules)\n\n2034091 - ET TROJAN MirrorBlast KiXtart Downloader Client Request (trojan.rules)\n\n\n-----\n\n2034110 - ET TROJAN MirrorBlast KiXtart Downloader Server Response (trojan.rules)\n\n2034136 - ET TROJAN MirrorBlast KiXtart Downloader Client Request M2 (trojan.rules)\n\n2034042 - ET TROJAN ReflectiveGnome Download Activity (trojan.rules)\n\n**EmergingThreats PRO Detection Rules**\n\n2850099 - ETPRO TROJAN FlawedGrace CnC Activity M2 (trojan.rules)\n\n2850098 - ETPRO TROJAN FlawedGrace CnC Activity M1 (trojan.rules)\n\n**Indicators of Compromise**\n\n\n**IOC** **IOC**\n**Type**\n\n\n**Description**\n\n\nhxxp://139.59.93.223/c[.]php URL MirrorBlast C&C\n\nhxxp://menorukis[.]su URL MirrorBlast C&C\n\nhxxp://fidufagios[.]com/ URL MirrorBlast C&C\n\nhxxp://feristoaul[.]com/ URL MirrorBlast C&C\n\nhxxp://172.105.178.119/install[.]msi URL MSI Download\n\nhxxp://207.246.101.153/chrome[.]msi URL MSI Download\n\nhxxp://207.246.101.153/setup[.]msi URL MSI Download\n\ncdn-wfs-nspod[.]com Domain FlawedGrace C&C\n\n\nhxxps://cdn03664-dlfileshare[.]com/files/xls/Employee%20Update%20%20Covid[.]xls\n\nhxxps://cdn-8846-sharepointoffice[.]com/CL09302021_00137[.]xls\n\n\nURL Initial Download\n\nURL Initial Download\n\n\n-----\n\nhxxps://cdn-8846-sharepointoffice[.]com/COVID19_list[.]xls\n\nhxxps://cdn-8846-sharepointoffice[.]com/FP01102021_001[.]xls\n\nhxxps://dzikic-mysharepoint[.]com/file/Manulife_policy[.]xls\n\nhxxps://dzikics-mysharepoint[.]com/file/Employee_Authorization_Form[.]xls\n\n\nURL Initial Download\n\nURL Initial Download\n\nURL Initial Download\n\nURL Initial Download\n\n\nhxxp://141.164.41[.]231/host64_sh[.]bin URL MirrorBlast Payload\n(FlawedGrace)\n\nhxxp://141.164.41[.]231/host32_pic[.]bin URL MirrorBlast Payload\n(FlawedGrace)\n\nhxxp://89.44.197[.]46/host64_sh[.]bin URL MirrorBlast Payload\n(FlawedGrace)\n\nhxxp://89.44.197[.]46/host32_pic[.]bin URL MirrorBlast Payload\n(FlawedGrace)\n\nhxxp://193.42.36[.]110/host64_sh[.]bin URL MirrorBlast Payload\n(FlawedGrace)\n\nhxxp://193.42.36[.]110/host32_pic[.]bin URL MirrorBlast Payload\n(FlawedGrace)\n\nhxxp://5.149.255[.]14/host64_sh[.]bin URL MirrorBlast Payload\n(FlawedGrace)\n\nhxxp://5.149.255[.]14/host32_pic[.]bin URL MirrorBlast Payload\n(FlawedGrace)\n\nhxxp://155.138.205[.]35/?pool URL First Stage Kixtart\nScript Payload\n\n\n-----\n\nhxxp://45.79.239[.]23/version.php?data= URL First Stage Kixtart\nScript C&C\n\nhxxp://185.202.93[.]201:80/mlp[.]php URL First Stage Kixtart\nScript C&C\n\nhxxp://185.183.96[.]147/?data= URL First Stage Kixtart\nScript C&C\n\nhxxp://185.176.220[.]198/?data= URL First Stage Kixtart\nScript C&C\n\nhxxp://155.138.205[.]35/ URL Excel MSI Payload\n\nhxxp://95.216.138[.]82/ URL Excel MSI Payload\n\nhxxp://194.180.174[.]6/ URL Excel MSI Payload\n\nhxxp://185.10.68[.]235/ URL Excel MSI Payload\n\nhxxp://185.225.19[.]246/ URL Excel MSI Payload\n\nhxxp://185.225.19[.]156/ URL Kixtart Payload\n(MirrorBlast)\n\nhxxp://192.36.27[.]92/10opd3r_load[.]msi URL Kixtart Payload\n(MirrorBlast)\n\nhxxp://5.188.108[.]40/trehjugdr4et6u[.]msi URL Kixtart Payload\n(MirrorBlast)\n\nSubscribe to the Proofpoint Blog\n\n\n-----",
