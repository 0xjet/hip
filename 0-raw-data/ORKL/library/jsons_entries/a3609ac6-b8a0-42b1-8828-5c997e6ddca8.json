In the alert, CERT-UA noted the delivery of a RAR file archive `\"Про збереження`\n```\nвідеоматеріалів з фіксацією злочинних дій армії російської федерації.rar\",\n\n```\nwhich translates to “On the preservation of video recordings of criminal actions of the army of\nthe Russian Federation.rar”. Additionally, they note the archive contains an executable file,\n\n\n-----\n\nwhich opens a lure document, and drops the DLL file `officecleaner.dat` and a batch\nfile `\"officecleaner\" . CERT-UA has named the malicious DLL ‘HeaderTip’ and notes`\nsimilar activity was recorded in September 2020.\n\nThe UAC-0026 activity is the first public example of a Chinese threat actor targeting Ukraine\nsince the invasion began. While there has been a marked increase in publicly reported\nattacks against Ukraine over the last week or so, these and all prior attacks have otherwise\noriginated from Russian-backed threat actors.\n\nRough timeline of recent Ukrainian conflict cyber activity\n\n## Connection of HeaderTip to Scarab APT\n\nScarab has a relatively long history of activity based on open source intelligence. The group\n[was first identified in 2015, while the associated IOCs are archived on OTX. As noted in the](https://web.archive.org/web/20150124025612/http://www.symantec.com:80/connect/blogs/scarab-attackers-took-aim-select-russian-targets-2012)\nprevious research, Scarab has operated since at least 2012, targeting a small number of\nindividuals across the world, including Russia, United States, and others. The backdoor\ndeployed by Scarab in their campaigns is most commonly known as Scieron.\n\nDuring our review of the infrastructure and HeaderTip malware samples shared by CERTUA, we identified relations between UAC-0026 and Scarab APT.\n\nWe assess with high confidence the recent CERT-UA activity attributed to UAC-0026 is the\nScarab APT group. An initial link can be made through the design of the malware samples\nand their associated loaders from at least 2020. Further relationships can be identified\nthrough the reuse of actor-unique infrastructure between the malware families associated\nwith the groups:\n\n508d106ea0a71f2fd360fda518e1e533e7e584ed (HeaderTip – 2021)\n121ea06f391d6b792b3e697191d69dc500436604 (Scieron 2018)\nDynamic.ddns[.]mobi (Reused C2 Server)\n\n\n-----\n\nAs noted in the 2015 reporting on Scarab, there are various indications the threat actor is\nChinese speaking. Based on known targets since 2020, including those against Ukraine in\nMarch 2022, in addition to specific language use, we assess with moderate confidence that\nScarab is Chinese speaking and operating under geopolitical intelligence collection\npurposes.\n\n## Lure Documents\n\nAnalysis of lure documents used for initial compromise can provide insight into those being\ntargeted and particular characteristics of their creator. For instance, in a September 2020\ncampaign targeting suspected Philippines individuals, Scarab made use of lure documents\n[titled “OSCE-wide Counter-Terrorism Conference 2020”. For context, OSCE is the](https://www.osce.org/who-we-are)\nOrganization for Security and Co-operation in Europe.\n\nSeptember 2020 Scarab APT Lure Document Content\n[More recently, industry colleagues have noted a case in which Scarab was involved in a](https://twitter.com/aRtAGGI/status/1506010831221248002)\ncampaign targeting European diplomatic organizations during the US withdrawal from\nAfghanistan.\n\nThe lure document reported by CERT-UA mimics the National Police of Ukraine, themed\naround the need to preserve video materials of crimes conducted by the Russian military.\n\n\n-----\n\nUkraine Targeting Lure Document\nLure documents through the various campaigns contain metadata indicating the original\ncreator is using the Windows operating system in a Chinese language setting. This includes\nthe system’s username set as “用户” (user).\n\n## Malware and Infrastructure\n\nMultiple methods have been in use to attempt to load the malware onto the target system. In\nthe case of the 2020 documents, the user must enable document Macros. In the most recent\nversion from CERT-UA, the executable loader controls the install with the help of a batch file\nwhile also opening the lure document. The loader executable itself contains the PDF, batch\ninstaller, and HeaderTip malware as resource data.\n\nThe batch file follows a simple set of instructions to define the HeaderTip DLL, set\npersistence under `HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run, and then`\nexecute HeaderTip. Exports called across the HeaderTip samples have been `HttpsInit`\nand `OAService, as shown here.`\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nofficecleaner.bat File Contents\n\n```\nThe HeaderTip samples are 32-bit DLL files, written in C++, and roughly 9.7 KB. The\nmalware itself will make HTTP POST requests to the defined C2 server using the user agent:\n```\n\"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64; Trident/7.0; rv:11.0) like Gecko\" .\n\n```\nGeneral functionality of HeaderTip is rather limited to beaconing outbound for updates,\npotentially so it can act as a simple first stage malware waiting for a second stage with more\ncapabilities.\n\nScarab has repeatedly made use of dynamic DNS services, which means C2 server IP, and\nsubdomains should not be considered related. In fact, some of the dynamic DNS services\nused by Scarab can easily link one to various unrelated APT groups, such as the infamous\nCloudHopper report or 2015 bookworm malware blogs. While those may be associated with\nChinese APTs, it may indicate more of a standard operating toolkit and approach rather than\nshared technical resources.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWe assess with high confidence the recent CERT-UA activity attributed to UAC-0026 is the\nScarab APT group and represents the first publicly-reported attack on Ukraine from a nonRussian APT. The HeaderTip malware and associated phishing campaign utilizing Macroenabled documents appears to be a first-stage infection attempt. At this point in time, the\nthreat actor’s further objectives and motivations remain unclear.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n**IOC** **Description**\n\nproduct2020.mrbasic[.]com March 2022 C2 Server\n\n8cfad6d23b79f56fb7535a562a106f6d187f84cf March 2022 Ukraine file delivery\narchive “Про збереження\nвідеоматеріалів з фіксацією\nзлочинних дій армії російської\nфедерації.rar”\n\ne7ef3b033c34f2ac2772c15ad53aa28599f93a51 March 2022 Loader Executable\n“officecleaner.dat”\n\nfdb8de6f8d5f8ca6e52ce924a72b5c50ce6e5d6a March 2022 Ukraine lure document\n“#2163_02_33-2022.pdf”\n\n\n-----\n\n4c396041b3c8a8f5dd9db31d0f2051e23802dcd0 March 2022 Ukraine batch file\n“officecleaner.bat”\n\n3552c184281abcc14e3b941841b698cfb0ec9f1d March 2022 Ukraine HeaderTip sample\n“httpshelper.dll”\n\nebook.port25[.]biz September 2020 C2 Server\n\nfde012fbcc65f4ab84d5f7d4799942c3f8792cc3 September 2020 file delivery archive\n“Joining Instructions IMPC 1.20 .rar”\n\ne30a24e7367c4a82d283c7c68cff5739319aace9 September 2020 lure document\n“Joining Instructions IMPC 1.20 .xls”\n\n5cc8ce82fc21add608277384dfaa8139efe8bea5 September 2020 HeaderTip samples\nbased on C2 use\n\nmert.my03[.]com September 2020 C2 Server\n\n90c4223887f10f8f9c4ac61f858548d154183d9a September 2020 file delivery archive\n“OSCE-wide Counter-Terrorism\nConference 2020.zip”\n\n82f8c69a48fa1fa23ff37a0b0dc23a06a7cb6758 September 2020 lure document\n“OSCE-wide Counter-Terrorism\nConference 2020”\n\nb330cf088ba8c75d297d4b65bdbdd8bee9a8385c September 2020 HeaderTip\nsample”officecleaner.dll”\n\n83c4a02e2d627b40c6e58bf82197e113603c4f87 HeaderTip (Possible researcher)\n\n508d106ea0a71f2fd360fda518e1e533e7e584ed HeaderTip\n\ndynamic.ddns[.]mobi C2 Server, overlaps with Scieron\n(b5f2cc8e8580a44a6aefc08f9776516a)\n\n\n-----",
