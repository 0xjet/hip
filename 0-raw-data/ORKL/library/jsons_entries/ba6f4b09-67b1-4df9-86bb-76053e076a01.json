ESET researchers also observed\na Go-based ransomware it tracks as HermeticRansom deployed during the campaign.\n[Following reports from ESET and other vendors, CrowdStrike began tracking the](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/news/252514038/HermeticWiper-poses-increasing-cyber-risk-to-Ukraine)\n\"sophisticated wiper\" under the name DriveSlayer.\n\nWhile analyzing DriveSlayer, CrowdStrike uncovered new insight into HermeticRansom,\nwhich it is tracking as PartyTicket.\n\n[CrowdStrike provided further analysis in a blog post Tuesday where the security vendor said](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/how-to-decrypt-the-partyticket-ransomware-targeting-ukraine/)\nPartyTicket ransomware \"superficially encrypts files\" due to implementation errors that make\n\"its encryption breakable and slow.\" While CrowdStrike did not attribute PartyTicket to a\nspecific threat group, it did provide further insight into the developer.\n\n\"This flaw suggests that the malware author was either inexperienced writing in Go or\ninvested limited efforts in testing the malware, possibly because the available development\ntime was limited,\" the blog post said.\n\nCrowdStrike published a script in the blog post that will decrypt files that have been locked\nby PartyTicket. \"Due to the previously discussed implementation errors in the AES key\ngeneration, it is possible to recover the AES key used for encryption by PartyTicket,\" it\nexplained.\n\nA sample analysis revealed many symbols referencing the U.S. political system, such as\nPresident Joe Biden and the White House. CrowdStrike observed that prior to encryption, the\nransomware renamed the file using a format that included the letters JB, which \"very likely\nstands for the initials of the United States president Joseph Biden.\"\n\n\n-----\n\nBased on the three factors including the deployment timing, political messaging and relative\nimmaturity\" of the ransomware, CrowdStrike said the primary use of PartyTicket is as an\n\"additional payload alongside DriveSlayer activity, rather than as a legitimate ransomware\nextortion attempt.\"\n\nSimilarly, ESET researchers determined that the ransomware was potentially used to hide\nthe actions of the data-wiping malware and did not mention any extortion motives. Several\nsecurity vendors and threat analysts have tracked destructive malware attacks against\nvarious targets in Ukraine since Russia's invasion of the country began last week.\n\n**Related Resources**\n\n[Five Tips to Improve a Threat and Vulnerability Management Program –](https://www.bitpipe.com/detail/RES/1348164125_521.html)\nSearchSecurity.com\n[Evolve your Endpoint Security Strategy Past Antivirus and into the Cloud –](https://www.bitpipe.com/detail/RES/1381712193_879.html)\nSearchSecurity.com\n[WhiteHat Sentinel Mobile: Datasheet –WhiteHat Security](https://www.bitpipe.com/detail/RES/1577466370_569.html)\nTowards an Autonomous Vehicle Enabled Society: Cyber Attacks and\nCountermeasures –ComputerWeekly.com\n\n**Dig Deeper on Threats and vulnerabilities**\n\nUkraine energy grid hit by Russian Indestroyer2 malware\n\nBy: Shaun Nichols\n\n\n-----\n\nSandworm rolls out Industroyer2 malware against Ukraine\n\nBy: Alex Scroxton\n\nCaddyWiper is fourth new malware linked to Ukraine war\n\nBy: Alex Scroxton\n\n\n-----\n\nHermeticWiper poses increasing cyber risk to Ukraine\n\nBy: Arielle Waldman\n\nSponsored News\n\n[Modernizing Cyber Resilience Using a Services-Based Model –Dell Technologies](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/FlexibleIT/Modernizing-Cyber-Resilience-Using-a-Services-Based-Model)\n[Defeating Ransomware With Recovery From Backup –Exagrid](https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatabackup/modern-backup-considerations/Defeating-Ransomware-With-Recovery-From-Backup)\n[What Do PCs Have to Do with Sustainability?
