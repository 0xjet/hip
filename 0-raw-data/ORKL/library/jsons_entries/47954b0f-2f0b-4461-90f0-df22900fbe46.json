    "plain_text": "# Doctor Web discovers Linux Trojan written in Rust\n\n**news.drweb.com/show/**\n\nDoctor Web\n\n[Back to news](https://news.drweb.com/list/?p=0&lng=en&c=5)\n\n**September 8, 2016**\n\n**Doctor Web’s specialists have discovered a new Linux Trojan written in the Rust**\n**programming language. The Trojan has been named Linux.BackDoor.Irc.16.**\n\n**[Linux.BackDoor.Irc.16 is a typical backdoor program that executes commands issued by](https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Linux.BackDoor.Irc.16&lng=en)**\ncybercriminals via the IRC (Internet Relay Chat) protocol. The Trojan connects to the public\nchat channel specified in its configuration and awaits its instructions.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Trojan can execute just four commands. It can connect to a specified chat channel; send\ncybercriminals information about an infected computer; send cybercriminals data about the\napplications running in a system; and delete itself from an infected machine.\n\n[Unlike the majority of its counterparts, Linux.BackDoor.Irc.16 is written in Rust, a](https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Linux.BackDoor.Irc.16&lng=en)\nprogramming language whose creation was sponsored by Mozilla Research. Its first stable\n[version was released in 2015. Linux.BackDoor.Irc.16 was designed to be a cross-platform](https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Linux.BackDoor.Irc.16&lng=en)\nTrojan—to make a version for Windows, for example, cybercriminals can just recompile this\nmalware program. Doctor Web’s analysts believe that Linux.BackDoor.Irc.16 is, in fact, a\nprototype (Proof of Concept), because it cannot replicate itself, and the IRC channel used by\nthe Trojan to receive commands from cybercriminals is not currently active.\n\nThe signature for **[Linux.BackDoor.Irc.16 is already in the Dr.Web for Linux database, and it](https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Linux.BackDoor.Irc.16&lng=en)**\nis successfully detected and removed by Doctor Web Anti-virus products.\n\n[More about this Trojan](https://vms.drweb.com/virus/?i=8566997&lng=en)\n\n[What is the benefit of having an account?](https://www.drweb.com/user/advantages/?lng=en)\n\n## Tell us what you think\n\nTo ask Doctor Web’s site administration about a news item, enter @admin at the beginning\nof your comment.
