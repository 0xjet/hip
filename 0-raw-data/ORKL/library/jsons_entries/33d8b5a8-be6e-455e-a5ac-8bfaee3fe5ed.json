So far, it seems as if**\n**the Belarusian regime has benefited the most from the Polish hack-and-leak scandal.**\n**But there is evidence that the leak is an offshoot of the Ghostwriter campaign, an**\n**influence operation pursuing Russian interests. Our analysis has revealed that the**\n**activities of a group that might have compromised over 700 email accounts –**\n**including Michał Dworczyk’s private email – bear striking resemblance to the attacks**\n**carried out by GRU-linked hacker groups such as Fancy Bear.**\n\nUntil recently, nearly every day for two months unknown perpetrators published new\ndocuments and screenshots of emails stolen from the inbox of the chief of the Chancellery of\nthe Prime Minister of Poland, Michał Dworczyk, on a Telegram channel. The shared\ncorrespondence included messages about state and political matters sent between\nDworczyk and the Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, from their private accounts.\nThe true scale and duration of the operation remain unknown; its origins might date back to\nthe beginning of the pandemic.\n\nThe Polish-language Telegram channel, which had been publishing leaked documents –\nalong with witty comments and memes – since early June was restricted for Polish\naudiences by the app developer in mid-July and soon after went completely silent. Before\n\n\n-----\n\nbeing effectively shut down, the channel had almost 90,000 views per day. The leaked\ndocuments are still available online: they have recently reemerged on Yandex chat and\ndedicated websites only accessible over Tor, but the scandal seems to have lost momentum\nin Poland.\n\nHowever, few Poles are aware of another information stream: a Russian-speaking Telegram\nchannel, where leaked documents about the Polish military first appeared in early February.\nThe channel remains active and intact despite the Polish government’s efforts to shut it\ndown. In Belarus, it has become a source of material for the regime’s propaganda machine.\n\nSince early July, pro-Lukashenko media and commentators have been making effective use\nof this correspondence to validate their official propaganda narrative: that the massive 2020\nprotests in Belarus were inspired and sponsored by Poland. Moreover, both the Polish\ngovernment’s reaction to the leaks and the opposition’s criticism of the situation fueled a\nstatement on the Telegram channel supporting the idea that “the Polish regime censors\nsocial media to remove inconvenient information about its blatant interference in Belarus’s\ninternal affairs,” which was reposted on the social media pages of Belarusian mainstream\nmedia outlets and channels such as OMON Moscow (this repost was quickly deleted).\n\n## Key findings\n\nIn recent weeks, we have cross-checked over 200 domains related to the infrastructure used\nin credential harvesting campaigns; analyzed the narratives disseminated on Polish and\nBelarusian social media; and interviewed sources from the Polish government, secret\nservices, military, and cybersecurity companies to understand the backstage of the so-called\nPolish email scandal.\n\nHere are some of our conclusions:\n\nThe hack-and-leak scandal involving Dworczyk’s email account is related to an\ninfluence operation serving Russian interests that has been dubbed “Ghostwriter” by\nresearchers from Mandiant, a cybersecurity company.\nThere are important similarities between the activities of UNC1151, the cyberespionage group that harvested credentials for the Ghostwriter campaign, and the\nactivities of GRU-linked groups like Fancy Bear and Sandworm.\nThe credentials and data stolen by UNC1151 might be used in several distinct\ndisinformation operations or might be shared by cooperating groups engaged in\ndifferent disinformation activities.\nSince spring 2020 a series of phishing attacks have targeted Polish politicians and\nother public figures, Poland’s Ministry of Defence remote work infrastructure and\nmilitary targets in Ukraine.\n\n\n-----\n\nAt the end of March, we published an investigation on an extensive disinformation\ncampaign that used accounts compromised in phishing attacks to validate and\ndisseminate fake news aimed at undermining Polish-Lithuanian relations and Poland’s\nposition in NATO – and hence government and security agencies had many\nopportunities to take action, but did nothing until recently. Even though one of\nDworczyk’s associates notified the Internal Security Agency (ABW) and other bodies\nresponsible for cybersecurity about their private e-mail correspondence being\npublished via a compromised Twitter profile in April, the possibility that Dworczyk’s\nemail account had been hacked was not investigated until June.\n\n## The government deepens the chaos\n\nOn July 12, after almost six weeks of silence from the parties involved, which only deepened\nthe chaos and disinformation surrounding the leak operation in Poland, Dworczyk and the\nChancellery of the PM provided some details about what happened. For now, it has been\nofficially confirmed that the private email address of the chief of the Chancellery of the PM\nhas been the target of at least five phishing attacks, two of which, those launched in\nSeptember 2020 and May 2021, were successful.\n\nThe government has declined to give an official comment on the authenticity of the published\nmessages, citing the ongoing investigation. But its silence on the matter is meant to distract\nfrom the sensitive content of the emails and the fact that they were sent from the private\naccounts of the head of the Chancellery of the PM, government officials, the prime minister,\nand some of his informal aides working for state companies.\n\n\n-----\n\nChief of the Chancellery of the Prime Minister of Poland Michał Dworczyk. Warszawa, March\n03, 2020.\n\nSource: Krystian Maj/KPRM\nUnofficial sources close to the Chancellery of the PM have identified most of the emails and\ndocuments published on the Polish-language Telegram channel as original pieces of\ncorrespondence from Dworczyk’s private account. That might, however, change at any\nmoment. In the case of the hack-and-leak attack on Hillary Clinton’s campaign in 2016,\ndoctored emails were identified only a year later. “Tainted leaks plant fakes in a forest of facts\nin an attempt to make them credible by association with genuine, stolen documents,” noted\nat the time John Scott-Railton of Citizen Lab, which analyzes disinformation operations. “It\nallows you to subtly shape a narrative that an organisation may have difficulty directly\nconfronting.”\n\nSeveral documents published on the Telegram channel aimed at Russian-speaking\naudiences were manipulated to seem more official than they were. Fabricated comments\nattributed to Polish politicians were even used to validate and promote some of these\ndocuments. These falsified endorsements were posted on the alleged “authors’”\ncompromised Twitter accounts — a strategy known from the previous attacks attributed to\nthe Ghostwriter operation.\n\nThose behind the operation could have easily foreseen that given the current polarization of\nthe public debate in Poland, the email scandal would soon take on a life of its own. For\ninstance, a statement that “most emails and documents are genuine” would power the\n\n\n-----\n\nnarrative of opposition politicians. A contrasting statement, that some of the documents may\nhave been manipulated, supports the narrative of Poland’s ruling party (PiS), as it is trying to\ndivert attention from the controversial content of some of the leaked emails.\n\nStirring up chaos, increasing polarization, and riling up the public are typical goals of\norganized disinformation operations.\n\n## The operation targets Poland, Lithuania, and Germany\n\nIn late March, [we published the results of an investigation conducted by Reporters](https://vsquare.org/privet-you-have-just-been-hacked/)\nFoundation and VSquare. We were first to link the months-long campaign led by unknown\nhackers who hijacked several Polish politicians’ social media accounts and posted\ncompromising and inflammatory content with the Russian-linked disinformation operation\ntargeting NATO members. The operation, dubbed “Ghostwriter,” [was described in the](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/07/ghostwriter-influence-campaign.html)\nsummer of 2020 by Mandiant, a cybersecurity company. In May 2020, researchers from the\n[Stanford Internet Observatory also independently analyzed some of its facets.](https://fsi-live.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/documents/sio_disinformation_polish_military_0.pdf)\n\nExperts believe that from March 2017 onward an unidentified group was running a European\ndisinformation campaign aligned with the Kremlin’s security interests. The operation was\ndubbed “Ghostwriter” due to the pattern repeated in most attacks – the perpetrators hack into\nnews portals using stolen login credentials, publish fake news articles by non-existent\nauthors (i.e., “ghostwriters”), and spread them through forged institutional emails. This group\ncarried out an attack on the website of the Polish War Studies Academy in April 2020,\npublishing a fake letter from the head of the academy that encouraged resistance to\ncooperating with NATO. The outcomes of such hacks were then disseminated by fake social\nmedia accounts.\n\nIn March 2021, we reported that the authors of the Ghostwriter operation had expanded their\n_modus operandi – the attackers began to spread fake news not only through the accounts of_\nfictitious persona but also through the hacked accounts of real-life public figures, a strategy\nobserved in Poland since November 2020. We also managed to tie these incidents to a\nphishing campaign that has been targeting the private email accounts of Polish officials since\nmid-2020.\n\nWe found that\n\nattackers may have already obtained a huge amount of sensitive information from the\nemail accounts of key people in Poland;\nthe phishing attacks targeted thousands of email accounts (current numbers indicate\nover 4,000 phishing attempts with over 700 email accounts likely compromised);\nphishing targets were deliberately chosen: the list of possible victims includes family\nmembers of politicians, analysts, journalists, scientists, and soldiers (the potential\ntargets of recruitment attempts by foreign intelligence);\n\n\n-----\n\nhijacked social media accounts were used to create and spread disinformation as part\nof campaigns that also involved the use of compromised websites of public institutions\nand local news outlets; and\nthe 2020 attacks were primarily aimed at harming Polish-Lithuanian relations and\nPoland’s NATO membership. However, Belarus was already mentioned in the attack in\nSeptember 2020 – one of the fake fake articles argued that Poland and Lithuania\nwanted NATO troops to be sent to Belarus.\n\nIn April 2021, after a similar series of phishing attacks on MPs from the German Bundestag,\nMandiant issued an update on the Ghostwriter operation. This report, consistent with our\nfindings, includes new technical details about the influence campaign. The company’s\nanalysts have linked the Ghostwriter operation to the UNC1151 cyber-espionage group,\nwhich is likely a state-sponsored actor that carries out phishing and malware attacks.\n\n## How Ghostwriter works\n\nLet’s now have a closer look at two disinformation attacks linked to the Dworczyk leaks. Both\nattacks involve coordinated publications of fabricated content on hacked social media\naccounts of PiS’s associates, the pattern typical for Ghostwriter operation. The hacks also\ninclude some new elements. In both cases, the screens of such fabricated posts were used\nby the Telegram channel or by the entire Belarusian propaganda machine to spread false\nnarratives:\n\nthat there is widespread criticism of Poland’s support for the Belarusian opposition,\neven within the ruling party,\nthat the protests against the results of the presidential election had been inspired and\nfunded by Poland.\n\nThe first attack from this series is conducted at the end of April and includes a leaked\ndocument that was previously published by a Belarusian blogger (see details in the graphic\npresentation below, click on the button in the top left corner to see interactive elements).\n\nTowards the end of April 2021, when Agnieszka Kamińska’s (the Head of Polish state radio)\nhacked Twitter account and the Telegram channel were used in an attack, there was also an\nattack in Lithuania that targeted Belarusian opposition activists Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya\nand Paweł Latuszka. It also used some new elements – a fake request for grants. The\nattackers used the account number of a Polish charity organisation from Vilnius, as well as a\nfake YouTube video created two days earlier, and the hijacked accounts of a member of the\nLithuanian Freedom Fighters Union, which were used to disseminate a link to the fake post\non Facebook and Twitter. Such a fabricated narrative was meant to present Lukashenka’s\n[opponents as frauds and embezzlers. The attack was described by experts at DFR Lab, who](https://medium.com/dfrlab/info-attack-targeting-lithuania-bears-hallmarks-of-operation-ghostwriter-2e2273d09c47)\nlinked it to the Ghostwriter operation.\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter the document was published by the hijacked account of Agnieszka Kaminska,\nDworczyk’s associate reported it to the cyber threats response teams at Internal Security\nAgency (ABW), Ministry of Defence (MON) and NASK. However, it never occurred to anyone\nthat the hack could have originated in Dworczyk’s email account. By June, all seems to be\nforgotten.\n\nThe same-pattern disinformation attack takes place on June 17, when the Dworczyk leaks\nscandal is already widely disputed in Poland.\n\nThis time, the source material is a document with a grant proposal coming from the hacked\nemail of Rafał Dzięciołowski, the president of the Polish Solidarity International Foundation,\nwhich supports projects in the Eastern Partnership countries. The disinformation attack also\nuses hacked social media accounts of PiS MP Ewa Szymańska, where screenshots of a\nfake discussion about the documents stolen from Dzięciołowski’s email account appeared.\n\nThe discussion included fake elements posted on other hacked accounts and revolved\naround the budget of Radio Racja, which broadcasts to the Belarusian minority in Poland\nand is supported by the Solidarity Foundation.\n\nDzięciołowski’s and Szymańska’s private email addresses were in Dworczyk’s hacked email\naccount – a fact confirmed by the minister himself.\n\n\n-----\n\nAgain, the false narrative created by fabricated comments suggests that the criticism of\nPoland’s support for the Belarusian opposition is cross-party and causes tensions both in\nPoland and Lithuania.\n\nThis time, fake news based on fabricated discussion is then published on another Belarusian\nTelegram channel and spread by channels of all the main state news outlets in Belarus.\n\n\n-----\n\nLess than two weeks after the manipulated content was published on Telegram,\nLukashenka’s regime [suspended Belarus’s participation in the Eastern Partnership.](https://www.euractiv.com/section/europe-s-east/news/eu-reproves-belarus-walkout-from-the-eastern-partnership/)\n\nThe report released by Mandiant in April also mentions an attempted phishing attack on “an\nimportant Belarusian blogger and activist.” It can be assumed it was one of the people\nrunning Nexta, a Telegram channel used by the opposition (on May 23, its co-creator Roman\nPratasevich was hijacked from a scheduled plane en route to Lithuania and is currently being\nheld by the Belarusian authorities). After the leak of Dworczyk’s emails, the creator of Nexta\nStepan Putilo confirmed attempts to hack the authors of the channel and announced that the\naccounts of the Belarusian House, an organization of the Belarusian minority in Poland, were\nalso targeted.\n\n## Successful exercises, harsh realities\n\nThe Polish email scandal that erupted in June is likely another result of the multifaceted\nGhostwriter operation, which was launched years ago.\n\nWe already mentioned the attack on the website of the Polish War Studies Academy,\nidentified as a part of the Ghostwriter campaign, that took place in April 2020. The Ministry of\nNational Defence remarked that “as an independent entity, the website of the academy is\nhosted outside the infrastructure of the Ministry of National Defence, and the incident itself\ndid not affect the functioning of the departmental ICT systems and the data processed in\nthose systems.” The ministry downplayed the incident as isolated.\n\nAlready at that time, in spring 2020, the cyberspies at UNC1151 were posed to unleash a\nwave of phishing attacks on Polish targets. The first domains used in the latest series of\nattacks were registered in around March and April 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic provided\nfertile ground for all kinds of cybercriminals as remote work blossomed. Many people who\nhad previously worked within secure office networks began using home networks and private\nelectronic devices for their jobs – including some politicians and government officials.\n\nOur analysis shows that one of the first phishing attempts made by these cyber criminals (in\nJune 2020) involved the spoofing of the domain poczta.ron.mil.pl. Until recently, this web\naddress served as the login page for employees of Poland’s Ministry of National Defence\nworking remotely. Its infrastructure is protected by the National Cyber Security Centre\n\n\n-----\n\n(NCBC), a body that secures both open and classified IT systems used by over 100,000\nmilitary-linked users, including soldiers on foreign missions. A month later, another domain\nwas registered – with a different extension but still very similar to the original.\n\nIt remains unclear whether any such attacks were successful.\n\nAt the end of May 2021, just a week before the Polish public learned about the leak of\nDworczyk’s emails, a team from the NCBC participated in a joint international training\nexercise based on a real-life scenario, fending off simulated cyberattacks on the website of\nPoland’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Embassy of the Netherlands in Lithuania: “The\nattackers posted fake content aimed at destabilising the political situation in Europe. […]\nThere is a reasonable suspicion that the computers and smartphones of the diplomats of the\nKingdom of the Netherlands, Poland, and Lithuania have been compromised by the\nadversaries.”\n\nA unit responsible for cybersecurity at the Ministry of National Defence boasted that “within\n48 hours, a team led by an officer at NCBC identified compromised devices, determined the\nfunctional role of the malware and the ways it spread.”\n\nThe authors of the note concluded: “Luckily, it was only a successful exercise.”\n\nDespite such successful exercises, the Ghostwriter hackers had already moved a step closer\nto achieving their goal – further destabilizing the political situation in Europe.\n\n## Vasya targets the Ukrainian army\n\nAfter failing to gain access to Ministry of National Defence inboxes, the attackers reached for\nlower-hanging fruit. Over a period of 12 months, they registered dozens of domains used to\ncarry out phishing campaigns. Many of them were designed to steal passwords from the\nusers of popular Polish email services such as wp.pl, interia.pl, and onet.pl. The campaign\nwas surprisingly effective: several hundred victims – including Marek Suski (a member of the\nParliamentary Intelligence Committee) and Dworczyk, took the bait, providing the attackers\nwith the passwords to their private email accounts.\n\nWe examined information from WHOIS records, which provide details about internet\ndomains, and cross-referenced it with data from various sources such as reports from\ncybersecurity companies and threat exchange platforms. We analyzed over 200 domains\nlinked to phishing attacks carried out in 2018–21. Dozens of them were used in Poland in a\nseries of cyberattacks between May 2020 and July 2021. Some of these domains were\nincluded in Mandiant’s last report on the Ghostwriter campaign; the experts tracked them\nback directly to UNC1151.\n\nIn April 2021, after an attempted attack on the email accounts of Bundestag MPs, Hakan\nTanriverdi, a journalist working for the German public broadcaster, looked into the email\ncampaign targeting German MPs The emails included a link to a domain that spoofed a\n\n\n-----\n\nGerman internet provider. He spotted a pattern: the same registrant was linked to over 30\nother domains. Mandiant confirmed his finding, noting that these domains were directly\ntraceable to UNC1151.\n\nWe followed this lead closely: first to non-existent addresses in Kyiv and the Altai Krai in\neastern Siberia, where shadowy registrants listed as “Vasya” and “Yun” registered dozens of\ndomains and subdomains for the sole purpose of stealing credentials.\n\nMany of these domains impersonated some of the most commonly used online services –\nGmail, Google Drive, Facebook, Twitter, and iCloud – as well as Polish email services such\nas wp.pl and onet.pl. Interestingly, the list also includes such targets as the aforementioned\nPolish Ministry of National Defence and Ukroboronprom, a Ukrainian defence conglomerate.\nOne of the oldest domains in this cluster, registered in March 2020, spoofed the website of\nthe Ukrainian army.\n\nWe tracked down other clusters of domains that followed the same pattern. An almost\nidentical batch of domains was registered in Poland; this time, the registrant was masked,\nbut the fact that they all contained the same typo distinguished them (“Warazawa” instead of\n“Warszawa”). We identified yet another cluster of domains registered in Bielsko. We\nconfirmed that these clusters included the domains at the source of Michał Dworczyk’s hackand-leak scandal, as well as the domains used to harvest credentials for Ghostwriter\nactivities. The domain used to successfully targeted Dworczyk’s account on wp.pl even\nshared the same IP address as the previously mentioned domain that spoofed ron.mil.pl\n(which was officially attributed to UNC1151 in Mandiant’s latest report).\n\nThe domains from all these clusters, registered between spring 2020 and summer 2021,\nseem to have been created and secured using the same know-how. They share the same\ndomain extensions and anonymization methods. In most cases, the servers are masked\nthrough Cloudflare, a content delivery network. This means that instead of connecting\nvisitors to the attacker’s server, it connects them to a copy located on Cloudflare’s servers. In\nother words, anyone trying to track down the website creator using its IP address will lose\ntrace of it in one of the 93 countries where Cloudflare servers are located. The identities of all\ndomain registrants are also masked using the same anonymization methods (even though\nthe registrants probably used false identities anyway). The registrants have honed their\nknow-how: from early 2021 on, the only information we could find in WHOIS entries is the\nregistration country (currently Iceland). Yet, the domains created during this period share\nenough distinctive features to spot patterns giving credibility to the suspicion that the same\nactor is hiding behind them all. We have identified over 30 such domains intended for use in\nPoland alone.\n\nOne of the most recent attack attempts we managed to trace originated from a domain\nregistered on June 9, 2021, disguised as a firewall configuration. As we found out, the\ntargets were the official email accounts of Polish MPs. The domain was redirecting to a\nwebsite that mimicked the Lotus login panel, but parliamentary spam filters detected and\n\n\n-----\n\nblocked this attempt (the Polish Parliament uses IBM s Lotus for email). However,\nDworczyk’s official Sejm email account (Dworczyk is also an MP) was successfully breached\nanyway. A print screen with the content of his parliamentary inbox, accessed on June 14,\nwas published on the Polish Telegram channel on July 1. The Internal Security Agency\n(ABW) confirmed the same attackers also breached the parliamentary email accounts of 10\nother MPs from different parties. For now, we can only guess how these hackers finally\n[accessed these MPs’ official email accounts – but Wirtualna Polska journalists revealed that](https://wiadomosci.wp.pl/ujawniamy-odkrylismy-krytyczne-bledy-w-poczcie-rzadu-i-sejmu-6658453740235328a)\nthere are serious email security vulnerabilities of both the Polish Parliament and many\ngovernment institutions services.\n\nWhy would a group famous for publishing embarrassing content or sophisticated fake news\non the hacked social media accounts of Polish MPs (as described in the first part of this\narticle) also aim its sights at more difficult targets such as the Ukrainian military or defence\nprojects? We assume that when it comes to such activities, including the attacks on the\nwebsite of the War Studies Academy and the Ministry of National Defence, there is more\nthan meets the eye: they may be part of a larger reconnaissance mission meant to scout out\ninfrastructure and pave the way for more complex attacks. By performing such “security\nchecks,” closely monitoring the response, and gaining access to the accounts of\ninfrastructure users, attackers can prepare for more serious operations.\n\n## Old tricks from the GRU playbook\n\nThe Mandiant report revealed that UNC1151 was already setting traps for internet users in\n2018, when it used inactive domains with the .ml and .tk country codes, the extensions of\nMali and Tokelau. They are popular with cybercriminals because they can be registered free\nof charge. Many phishing attacks from that period originating from those domains are now\nconsidered to be the work of UNC1151. They targeted Ukrainian email accounts, but we\nwere drawn to an address created in April 2018 with the clear intention of stealing data from\nthe address employees used to log into their email, poczta.mon.gov.pl. Today, ron.mil.pl is\nused for that purpose. In 2020, it too came under attack from UNC1151.\n\nThe fake address mon-gov.ml (with a hyphen instead of a dot) redirected to another\ninteresting website that contains some clues about the activities of a different group of cyber\nthreat actors.\n\nPhishing domains are usually short-lived; their lifespans depend on how fast service\nproviders or anti-spam filters respond to the threats they pose. Therefore, cybercriminals\nmust develop ever-more creative ideas for duping internet users. In 2018, UNC1151 used\nthe address http://poczta.mon-gov.ml/. This was a successful move – the domain was not\ndeleted until October 2020. It was not the first phishing attempt on a website mimicking the\nwebsite of Poland’s Ministry of National Defence.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn February 2016, an address created using the same pattern (poczta.mon-gov.pl; again, a\ndot was replaced with a hyphen) was used by other perpetrators to steal data from the\nMinistry of National Defence. Two years before that, in 2014, attempts were made using\npoczta.mon.q0v.pl. The domain mon-gov.pl was taken over by the Polish CERT, a\ngovernment body responsible for cybersecurity, and g0v.pl currently belongs to a Polish user;\nboth are therefore useless for would-be attackers.\n\nCybersecurity analysts have identified the masterminds of these earlier attacks as APT28\n(APT stands for “advanced persistent threat”). This is one of the many aliases used by a\ngroup of activists calling itself Fancy Bear, which has been revealed to be a unit of the GRU,\nthe Russian military intelligence agency.\n\nOne could say that such similarities in modus operandi might be a coincidence (after all, the\npossibility of impersonating mon.gov.pl is limited by a finite number of possible combinations)\nbut when we take a closer look at specific domains, we can find more common patterns.\n\nMandiant says that the activities attributed to UNC1151 include attacks on email accounts\nused by the Kuwaiti army. We managed to identify the domain UNC1151 used to carry out\nthe attack back in 2018. Cybersecurity experts at TrendMicro have said that an almost\nidentical domain (with the only difference being the extension) was used by Fancy Bear in\nOctober 2015.\n\nAnalysts have been closely monitoring the activities of Fancy Bear for many years. The latest\nreport produced by TrendMicro, which has been monitoring email phishing attacks since\n2014, identified a new trend in the tactics, techniques, and methods of this group (which\nTrendMicro calls Pawn Storm). In May 2019, it began to impersonate its victims, sending\ninfected files or links to password-phishing addresses to other people from their\ncompromised accounts. The phishing domains used by Fancy Bear provided at the end of\nthe report published in 2019 are nearly identical to those traced back to UNC1151 in 2018\n(this time around, they used the .ml and .tk extensions).\n\nDoes this mean there could be a relationship between UNC1151 and Fancy Bear? There are\na number of indications that there might be a link between their activities. On many levels,\nUNC1151 seems to be a faithful follower of the GRU playbook, with similar goals and\nmethods.\n\nUNC1151’s cyberespionage activities might serve various goals – the Ghostwriter operation,\nofficial Lukashenka regime propaganda, or intelligence recruitment. The information acquired\nmight also be used in spy games or for blackmail.\n\nAlthough such activities should have alarmed the entire counterintelligence sector in Poland\nlong ago, they didn’t.\n\n## Hackers or artists\n\n\n-----\n\nHackers are free people like artists. If artists get up in the morning feeling good, all they do\nall day is paint. The same goes for hackers. They got up today and read that something is\ngoing on internationally. If they are feeling patriotic they will start contributing, as they\nbelieve, to the justified fight against those speaking ill of Russia,” teasingly responded\nVladimir Putin in 2017 to questions about the Kremlin’s interference in the US elections in\n2016.\n\nAt that time Russia already had one of the world’s largest cyber armies – for several years, it\nhad intensively recruited and trained young IT specialists and programmers, who quickly\njoined the ranks of civilian and military services, including the GRU and the Foreign\nIntelligence Service (SWR). Increasingly spectacular cyberattacks could be traced back to\nMoscow. At the same time, more and more advanced disinformation operations were carried\nout by the Internet Research Agency in St. Petersburg (nicknamed “the troll factory” by the\npress).\n\nIn 2016, NATO recognized cyberspace as a domain of operation, equal to that of land, sea,\nand air. A year later, fake news would become the Collins Dictionary word of the year.\n\nThe attacks carried out by Fancy Bear include the following (officially recognized) operations:\n\nAttacks on the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and its American counterpart\n(USADA), and at least four other anti-doping institutions; cyber attackers stole and\npublished sensitive information about the health of nearly 250 athletes from 30\ncountries, reinforcing the Kremlin narrative about the unfair disqualification of the\nRussian national team from the 2018 Winter Olympics; at that time Fancy Bear\n“hacktivists” were disseminating stolen documents while maintaining the appearance of\n“bottom-up” activities.\nAn attempt to infiltrate the infrastructure of the Organisation for the Prohibition of\nChemical Weapons (OPCW), which investigated the use of chemical weapons in Syria\nand the use of Novichok to poison Sergei Skripal (2018), a former GRU agent who had\ncollaborated with British services. This attempt was foiled by Dutch intelligence.\n\nBoth attacks were so well documented that in October 2018, the US Department of Justice\nindicted seven Russian intelligence officers identified as members of GRU Unit 26165.\n\nA separate indictment was filed in connection with the attack on the Hillary Clinton campaign\n– according to investigators, as many as 12 people, members of two cyber-espionage\ngroups (Sandworm and Fancy Bear), were involved in the attack.\n\n\n-----\n\nPresidential candidate Hilary Clinton during a rally just days before the election.

The operation began with](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco/file/1373816/download)\na massive phishing attack launched by Fancy Bear against members of the Democratic\nNational Committee (DNC). First, 50,000 email messages from John Podesta’s account were\nleaked (Podesta was Clinton’s campaign chief). At the same time, rather careless victims\nallowed hackers to gain access to the DNC’s internal network, who then uploaded software\nthat logged keystrokes and screenshots.\n\nMeanwhile, a second group began to disseminate stolen email messages via a specially\ncreated DCLeaks website. It sent them to the media under the guise of a fictional hacktivist,\nknown as Guccifer 2.0, who even granted interviews.\n\nThe disinformation campaign that accompanied the publication of the cache of messages,\nwhich included both authentic and fake emails, buried Hillary Clinton’s chances of becoming\nUS president.\n\nClinton’s official Department of State email account was also targeted, but two-step\nverification was enabled and effectively blocked the attack. At the same time, it was revealed\nthat Clinton, used a private email address and private server for state affairs during her\ntenure as US Secretary of State. FBI director James Comey called this behaviour extremely\n\n\n-----\n\ncareless despite the use of two-step verification. Neither Mateusz Morawiecki nor Michał\nDworczyk learned any lessons from the Clinton scandal: five years later, they were caught\ngoverning Poland using their private email accounts.\n\nIt is interesting to note that an investigation after the attack on Clinton’s campaign revealed\nthat apart from the Fancy Bear and Sandworm groups, another (third) Russian unit had\naccess to the DNC servers at that time. The group, called Cozy Bear, is associated with the\nRussian SWR. It was probably an independent operation, part of a long-term espionage\nmission.\n\nIn the context of Dworczyk’s email scandal, the long list of attacks cybersecurity firms has\nattributed to Fancy Bear is also interesting.\n\nIn 2017, some documents stolen from the email account of journalist David Satter, a Kremlin\ncritic, were tampered with and released as “leaks.” Satter was the victim of a wide-ranging\nphishing operation that targeted more than 200 recipients in 39 countries.\n\nFancy Bear may have also attempted to interfere in the 2017 French presidential election.\nTwo days before the election, 20,000 emails concerning Emmanuel Macron’s campaign were\nleaked. The documents were posted on PasteBin, a service that allows the anonymous\nsharing of raw texts via a link. Still, the operation failed as the huge amount of data was\nreleased just before the election silence went into effect and hence did not get through to the\nmedia. The French authorities announced that the attack was so general and simple that\n“anyone could have committed it.”\n\nHowever, there are many clues indicating that it was in fact a complicated operation.\nAnalysts quoted by Le Monde suggested that although Fancy Bear had begun to prepare for\nthe attack in March 2017, it discontinued the operation in mid-April, and another group,\nSandworm, picked up where it had finished. Recall that Sandworm was allegedly responsible\nfor distributing emails stolen by Fancy Bear during the DNC hack in 2016. In October 2020,\nthe US Department of Justice announced that it had charged six identified hackers, members\nof the Sandworm group, who were simultaneously employees of GRU Unit 74455, in\nconnection with cyber-espionage activities.\n\nApart from the attacks on the Macron and Clinton campaigns, which were carried out jointly\nwith Fancy Bear, Sandworm was also responsible for cyber attacks committed “in the\nstrategic interests of Russia”:\n\nattacks on Ukrainian power plants and transmission networks in 2015 and 2016;\nthe global use of NotPetya, destructive malware that encrypted and wiped the disks of\nmany electronic devices;\nan attack on the organizing committee of the 2018 Winter Olympics (for the same\nmotives that made Fancy Bear leak athletes’ data); and\n\n\n-----\n\nphishing campaigns carried out against OPCW employees investigating the use of\nNovichok to poison Skripal, in the same year that officers from GRU Unit 26165\nattempted to physically “plug” into its system.\n\n[Court documents related to the GRU agents involved in the activities of Fancy Bear and](https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1328521/download)\nSandworm, as well as reports published by cybersecurity firms, reveal the complexity of\nthese multilayered operations. Sometimes they were carried out independently, at other\ntimes, in cooperation with other groups. They nearly always involve multiple techniques and\nmethods: from massive or personalized phishing attacks to the use of malware or stolen\nelectronic documents, and fake online personas or fake social media accounts.\n\nThe court files read like the plot of a sensational novel. When the hackers were unable to\nhunt down their victims remotely, GRU agents travelled around the world (from Lausanne to\nRio de Janeiro) to physically hack target infrastructure (for instance, by connecting to a hotel\nWi-Fi network). However, the basic tool was not very sophisticated phishing.\n\nCybersecurity firms have long examined the relationship between Fancy Bear and\nSandworm. In many cases, the two groups cannot be clearly distinguished from each other.\nAnalysts have described Sandworm as “a more specialised group, which carried out highrisk operations, particularly when the time was of the essence.”\n\nIn 2017, _[Russian](https://theins.ru/politika/236113)_ _Insider wrote about Fancy Bear: “[Unlike Sandworm], Fancy Bear is rather_\nprimitive – it carried out mass phishing campaigns, waiting for someone to click the link and\nshare their password. The main task of Fancy Bear was to gain access to information that\nwas then used for political purposes. For example, the documents obtained were modified,\ncompromising information was added, and then posted on various websites owned by proKremlin ‘activists’, and later promoted by the Kremlin media and troll farms.”\n\nThe activities of both groups required, as Russian _Insider stressed, permanent well-trained_\nstaff and significant financial resources. They were clearly beyond the reach of lone wolf\ncybercriminals. The court files on the GRU agents indicate that both groups were based at\nthe same Moscow address, in a building owned by the Russian Ministry of Defence.\n\nAre the members of UNC1151 just skilled followers of the GRU playbook with no direct links\nto Russian intelligence services? In the cyber-espionage world, where groups cover up their\ntracks with false flags (e.g., Fancy Bear impersonated Ukrainian hackers or ISIS supporters),\nanything is possible, but it seems unlikely.\n\nLet’s now compare the resources used by Fancy Bear and Sandworm revealed by American\ninvestigators and the scale of the operation currently taking place in Poland. The Polish\noperation, attributed to UNC1151, required\n\n1. creating a database of over 4,000 non-random targets, obtaining their private email\n\naddresses and, in many cases, collecting information about members of their families;\n\n\n-----\n\n2. registering several dozen domains for operations in Poland (the group was also active\n\nin other countries);\n3. analyzing the content of hacked email accounts (probably more than 700 accounts\n\nmight have been taken over), accessing associated social media accounts, and\npossibly also viewing their content;\n4. according to the Mandiant report, the group is also capable of using malicious software\n\n_and additional skills; and_\n5. carrying out targeted disinformation campaigns and knowing the specifics of the Polish\n\nmedia landscape.\n\nTo sum up, this is not something that a few freelancing hackers could have done “out of a\nbasement.”\n\nThe Mandiant report states that at this point the activities of UNC1151 cannot be linked to\nany previously tracked groups. However, German public television journalist Hakan\nTanriverdi revealed that German intelligence services had informed a Bundestag committee\nthat GRU units were behindGhostwriter.\n\n## How the Polish services failed to uncover Ghostwriter\n\nIn response to the deepening public confusion surrounding the case, on June 22, the\n[spokesman of the minister-coordinator of the Special Services issued a statement in which](https://www.gov.pl/web/sluzby-specjalne/findings-regarding-hacker-attacks)\nhe announced that the attack on Dworczyk’s email account was part of the Ghostwriter\noperation, the focus of a report we published on vsquare.org at the end of March.\n\n“The list of targets of the socio-technical attack carried out by the UNC1151 group included\nat least 4,350 email accounts that were used by Polish citizens or were provided on Polish\nemail servers. At least 500 users [their number has since exceeded 700] responded to the\ninformation prepared by the attackers, which significantly increased the probability of the\naggressors’ actions being effective […] The list of 4,350 attacked email accounts includes\nover 100 accounts used by people who performed public duties. […] The list also includes an\nemail account used by Michał Dworczyk,” the statement reads.\n\nWhy was the government alarmed only after Dworczyk’s email scandal broke out? If the\nlatest attack is another outcome of the Ghostwriter operation, the government’s cybersecurity\nforces should have been aware of it much earlier.\n\nWhat did the secret services really know about the attack and when did they first learn about\n[it? Shortly after the scandal erupted, we revealed in OKO.press that the first warning signs](https://oko.press/rzad-zhakowany-siedzielismy-na-tykajacej-bombie-i-ona-wlasnie-wybuchla/)\nabout a series of attacks appeared in the autumn of 2020. After the email accounts of the\nMinistry of Family and Social Policy Marlena Maląg and MP Marcin Duszek were hacked\n(between October and December 2020), the case was examined by the army’s cybersecurity\nunit (CSIRT MON).\n\n\n-----\n\nIn December, the Critical Incidents Team at the Government Security Centre (RCB), which is\nresponsible for threat analysis and crisis management, convened. During the meeting, Col.\nKonrad Korpowski, head of the RCB, allegedly asked whether the hacking campaign should\nbe considered a critical incident. It was decided that it should not be. Six months later,\nKorpowski’s CV, which had been sent to Michał Dworczyk’s private email account, was\npublished on Telegram.\n\nIn January, the Chancellery of the PM sent an online brochure to all MPs on how to protect\ntheir accounts against cyberattacks.\n\nIn early March 2021, a note on cyberattacks, jointly signed by the Cyber Incident Response\nTeams found its way to the desk of Marek Zagórski, at that time the Cybersecurity\nPlenipotentiary at the Chancellery of the PM. But no action was taken for another three\nmonths.\n\nIn the meantime, at the end of April, Dworczyk’s associate Karol Kotowicz notified the Cyber\nIncident Response Teams that a document from his email exchange was published on\nAgnieszka Kamińska’s Twitter account.\n\nHowever, by June no one had yet discovered that in early February someone had set up a\nRussian-language channel on Telegram. The channel began to publish documents that\nallegedly originated from within the Polish government.\n\nThe Polish-language channel was created on June 4 but went unnoticed until June 8. The\npublic learned about the existence of the channel from the Facebook account of Dworczyk’s\nwife (which had also been taken over). These methods resembled those used in the past as\npart of the Ghostwriter operation.\n\nThe channel published new emails and documents from Dworczyk’s hacked account almost\nevery day until it was shut down (after gathering over 9,900 subscribers).\n\nOn June 15, the Critical Incidents Team convened again; this time, it agreed to rank the\ncyberattack as a critical incident. On the same day, Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki\nsubmitted a motion to convene a closed session of the Polish Sejm.\n\nOn the morning before the session, the Government Crisis Management Team was to hold\nanother meeting, where representatives of cybersecurity services would gather. According to\nunofficial sources, the initial plan was to immediately check whether MPs’ accounts were on\nthe list of attacked emails. The Chancellery of the Sejm had even set up a special computer\nto run the check. But at the very last moment, the plan was abandoned.\n\n“Someone close to Kaczyński [PiS leader] had probably looked at the list of potential targets\nof phishing attacks and realized that it included more of our politicians than those of the\nopposition,” one of our sources closely linked to PiS told us.\n\n\n-----\n\nInstead, it was decided that the police should disseminate leaflets on cybersecurity prepared\nby the Chancellery of the PM; all those whose email accounts were on the list of phishing\nattacks received special letters (including people whose accounts had not been\ncompromised).\n\nOn June 10, the District Prosecutor’s Office in Warsaw launched an investigation into the\nunauthorized accessing of Dworczyk’s email account. The Polish government also notified\nNATO about a cyber operation targeting Poland. Both Telegram channels were shut down on\nJuly 15 but resurfaced several hours later.\n\nNobody knows what new twists and turns the next chapter authored by Ghostwriter will bring.\n\n_Konrad Szczygieł, from the Reporters Foundation, contributed to this report._\n\n[Read in Polish on tvn24.pl](https://tvn24.pl/premium/afera-mailowa-rzadu-pis-ghostwriter-apt28-fancy-bear-sand-warm-kto-moze-stac-za-atakiem-na-poczte-michala-dworczyka-5152615)\n\n\n-----",
