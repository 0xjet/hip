An unknown attacker, referred to as [UNC2452 or](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-with-sunburst-backdoor.html) [DarkHalo planted a backdoor](https://www.volexity.com/blog/2020/12/14/dark-halo-leverages-solarwinds-compromise-to-breach-organizations/)\nin the SolarWinds Orion IT software. This backdoor, which comes in the form of a .NET\nmodule, has some really interesting and rather unique features.\n\nWe spent the past days checking our own telemetry for signs of this attack, writing additional\ndetections and making sure that our users are protected. At the moment, we identified\napproximately ~100 customers who downloaded the trojanized package containing the\nSunburst backdoor. Further investigation is ongoing and we will continue to update with our\nfindings.\n\nNow, several things really stand out for this incident. This supply chain attack was designed\nin a very professional way – kind of putting the “A” in “APT” – with a clear focus on staying\nundetected for as long as possible. For instance, before making the first internet connection\n\n\n-----\n\nto its C2s, the Sunburst malware lies dormant for a long period, of up to two weeks, which\nprevents an easy detection of this behavior in sandboxes. Other advanced threat groups are\nalso known to adopt similar strategies, for instance with hardware or firmware implants,\nwhich “sleep” for weeks or months before connecting to their C2 infrastructure. This explains\nwhy this attack was so hard to spot.\n\nOne of the things that sets this apart from other cases, is the peculiar victim profiling and\nvalidation scheme. Through the SolarWinds Orion IT packages, the attackers reached about\n18,000 customers, according to the SolarWinds alert. Yet, out of these 18.000, it would\nappear that only a handful were interesting to them. Considering the fact that having the\nresources to manually exploit 18,000 computer networks is probably outside the reach of\nmost if not all the attackers out there, this leads to the point that obviously some of those\nwould have been a higher priority. Finding which of the 18,000 networks were further\nexploited, receiving more malware, installing persistence mechanisms and exfiltrating data is\nlikely going to cast some light into the attacker’s motives and priorities.\n\nIn the initial phases, the Sunburst malware talks to the C&C server by sending encoded DNS\nrequests. These requests contain information about the infected computer; if the attackers\ndeem it interesting enough, the DNS response includes a CNAME record pointing to a\nsecond level C&C server.\n\nOur colleagues from FireEye published several DNS requests that supposedly led to\nCNAME responses on Github:\nhttps://github.com/fireeye/sunburst_countermeasures/blob/main/indicator_release/Indicator_\nRelease_NBIs.csv\n\n**DNS CNAME request-response pairs (Copyright 2020 by FireEye, Inc.)**\n\n## The goal\n\nKnowing that the DNS requests generated by Sunburst encode some of the target’s\ninformation, the obvious next step would be to extract that information to find out who the\nvictims are!\n\n\n-----\n\nOur colleagues from QiAnXin Technology already published a Python script to decode the\ndomain names (on Github, of course):\n[https://github.com/RedDrip7/SunBurst_DGA_Decode/blob/main/decode.py . Unfortunately,](https://github.com/RedDrip7/SunBurst_DGA_Decode/blob/main/decode.py)\nthat script cannot decode all the DNS requests, besides it is always good to practice in\nreverse engineering anyway, so let’s look in the malware code.\n\n### TL;DR\n\n**Three of the requests from FireEye’s Github repository can be mapped to two domain**\n**names that belong to a government organization and a telecommunications company**\n**in the US.**\n\n## Low-level details\n\nThe sample we’ll be analyzing is 2c4a910a1299cdae2a4e55988a2f102e. All we need is a\n.NET decompiler (dnSpy is a good one).\n\nThe logic that is interesting to us is located in OrionImprovementBusinessLayer.Update,\nwhich in turn calls one of the four functions: GetCurrentString, GetPreviousString,\n_GetNextStringEx and GetNextString._\n\nThese four functions correspond to four different DNS-based communication methods.\n\nNow, to find out what kind of data is encoded in the DNS requests (the hostname variable)\nwe need to look closer into each one of these functions.\n\nThe first function GetCurrentString generates strings that contain a supposedly unique\ntarget’s identifier (this.guid), the target’s hostname (this.dnStrLower) and the rest of the\nhostname that will be in form of “appsync-api.*.avsvmcloud[.]com”. The encoding of the data\nis done by the functions CreateSecureString and CreateString.\n\nThe function GetPreviousString is bigger, but produces a similar hostname for a DNS\nrequest. It includes a part of the target’s hostname in the request, so that it would match the\nlimitations on the request length Each such request also includes the sequence number\n\n\n-----\n\n(this.nCount) that is the offset of the current substring from the beginning of the hostname.\n\nThe remaining two functions, GetNextStringEx and GetNextString, generate a different type\nof DNS requests. They include only the target’s UID, hashes of the running processes of\ninterest and (only in the Ex version) the list and status of these processes. The target’s UID\nis then encrypted, and the data is encoded with CreateSecureString.\n\n## The problem\n\nThe encryption used in the malware is just a simple XOR operation, and the encoding is\neither a substitution cipher or Base32 with a custom alphabet. However, if we reverse the\nsequence of operations of GetPreviousString or GetCurrentString for the known CNAME\nDNS requests published by FireEye, the resulting strings don’t look like valid domain names!\n\nA possible explanation is that the requests were generated by the third or fourth\ncommunication methods, described as GetNextStringEx or GetNextString. Indeed, they can\nbe decoded without errors and the size of decoded data fits. However, these requests don’t\n\n\n-----\n\nhave the target s name included!\n\n## The solution\n\nAt this point, a question arises – can we match any of existing private and public DNS data\nfor the malware root C2 domain, “avsvmcloud[.]com” with the CNAME records, to identify\nwho was targeted for further exploitation?\n\nA list of SUNBURST-generated domain names that include the domain names were kindly\nshared by John Bambenek on Github:\n[https://github.com/bambenek/research/blob/main/sunburst/uniq-hostnames.txt .](https://github.com/bambenek/research/blob/main/sunburst/uniq-hostnames.txt)\n\nHere’s a few such examples:\n\nnnbggtlr1iv0v3vfnfaddfe.appsync-api.us-west-2.avsvmcloud[.]com\n\nnq97kdu88pn1qpv8f3t5.appsync-api.us-east-1.avsvmcloud[.]com\n\nnr2ia9qfa349b0q2oi60bou6iuir02rn.appsync-api.us-east-1.avsvmcloud[.]com\n\nWe complemented John’s data with our own datasets as well as other publicly available\npDNS databases. Each one of these DNS requests also has the Base32-encoded UID.\nSince the UIDs are also included in other types of requests (types 3 and 4) in encrypted\nform, this allows us to match the requests!\n\nThe target’s UID is calculated in OrionImprovementBusinessLayer.GetOrCreateUserID by\nMD5-hashing the MAC address of the first online network adapter, then XORing it down to\n64 bits.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe DNS requests published by FireEye on their GitHub have the following encrypted UIDs\ninside:\n\n**DNS request** **UID (64 bit)**\n\n\n**6a57jk2ba1d9keg15cbg.appsync-api.eu-west-**\n**1.avsvmcloud[.]com**\n\n**7sbvaemscs0mc925tb99.appsync-api.us-west-**\n**2.avsvmcloud[.]com**\n\n**gq1h856599gqh538acqn.appsync-api.us-west-**\n**2.avsvmcloud[.]com**\n\n**ihvpgv9psvq02ffo77et.appsync-api.us-east-**\n**2.avsvmcloud[.]com**\n\n**k5kcubuassl3alrf7gm3.appsync-api.eu-west-**\n**1.avsvmcloud[.]com**\n\n\n0xEED328E059EB07FC\n\n0x683D2C991E01711D\n\n0x2956497EB4DD0BF9\n\n0xF7A37335B9E57DDB\n\n0xA46E6E874771323C\n\n\n-----\n\n**mhdosoksaccf9sni9icp.appsync-api.eu-west-**\n**1.avsvmcloud[.]com**\n\n\n0xA46E6E874771323C\n\n\nIn total, we analyzed 1722 DNS records, leading to 1026 unique target name parts and 964\nunique UIDs.\n\nMatching the two lists we got the following data:\ndomain name part(0x2956497EB4DD0BF9)=central.****.g\ndomain name part(0x2956497EB4DD0BF9)=ov\ndomain name part(0x683D2C991E01711D)=central.****.g\ndomain name part(0x683D2C991E01711D)=ov\ndomain name part(0xF7A37335B9E57DDB)=***net.***.com\nThese steps effectively decoded 3 of the 6 CNAME records provided by FireEye into two\npossible domains:\n\n*****net.***.com – a rather big telecommunications company from the US, serving more**\n**than 6 million customers**\n**central.***.gov – a governmental organization from the US**\n\nPlease note that for ethical reasons, we do not include these exact domain names here. We\nnotified the two organizations in question though, offering our support to discover further\nmalicious activities, if needed.\n\nIt should also be noted that there is no way to be sure that machines in these two domains\nwere actually further exploited. This being a probabilistic puzzle, we can assume with a\n**high degree of certitude the two decoded domains were interesting to the attackers,**\nhowever, we cannot be 100% sure that associated organizations were the subject of further\nmalicious activities.\n\nTo summarize our research, the UIDs we discovered match two domain names that belong\nto a US government organization and a large US telecommunications company. It is likely\nthat other interesting targets were selected by the attackers for further exploitation. If you\nhappen to have access to large DNS databases, including CNAME replies for any\nsubdomain in “avsvmcloud[.]com”, please let us know!

Contact: intelreports (at) kaspersky [dot] com\n\n\n-----\n\n## Sunburst / UNC2452 / DarkHalo FAQ\n\n1. Who is behind this attack? I read that some people say APT29/Dukes?\n\nAt the moment, there are no technical links with previous attacks, so it may be an\nentirely new actor, or a previously known one that evolved their TTPs and opsec to the\npoint where they can’t be linked anymore. Volexity, who previously worked on other\nincidents related to this, named the actor DarkHalo. FireEye named them “UNC2452”,\nsuggesting an unknown actor. While some media sources linked this with\nAPT29/Dukes, this appears to be either speculation or based on some other,\nunavailable data, or weak TTPs such as legitimate domain re-use.\n2. I use Orion IT! Was I a target of this attack?\n\nFirst of all, we recommend scanning your system with an updated security suite,\ncapable of detecting the compromised packages from SolarWinds. Check your network\ntraffic for all the publicly known IOCs – see\n[https://github.com/fireeye/sunburst_countermeasures. The fact that someone](https://github.com/fireeye/sunburst_countermeasures)\ndownloaded the trojanized packages doesn’t also mean they were selected as a target\nof interest and received further malware, or suffered data exfiltration. It would appear,\nbased on our observations and common sense, that only a handful of the 18,000 Orion\nIT customers were flagged by the attackers as interesting as were further exploited.\n3. Was this just espionage or did you observe destructive activities, such as\n\n**ransomware?**\nWhile the vast majority of the high-profile incidents nowadays include ransomware or\nsome sort of destructive payload (see NotPetya, Wannacry) in this case, it would\nappear the main goal was espionage. The attackers showed a deep understanding and\nknowledge of Office365, Azure, Exchange, Powershell and leveraged it in many\ncreative ways to constantly monitor and extract e-mails from their true victims’ systems.\n4. How many victims have been identified?\n\nSeveral publicly available data sets, such as the one from John Bambenek, include\nDNS requests encoding the victim names. It should be noted that these victim names\nare just the “first stage” recipients, not necessarily the ones the attackers deemed\ninteresting. For instance, out of the ~100 Kaspersky users with the trojanized package,\nit would appear that none were interesting to the attackers to receive the 2nd stage of\nthe attack.\n5. What are the most affected countries?\n\nTo date, we observed users with the trojanized Orion IT package in 17 countries.\nHowever, the total number is likely to be larger, considering the official numbers from\nSolarWinds.\n6. Why are you calling this an attack, when it’s just exploitation? (CNA vs CNE)\n\nSorry for the terminology, we simply refer to it as a “supply chain attack”. It would be\nodd to describe it as a “supply chain exploitation”.\n\n\n-----\n\n7. Out of the 18,000 first stage victims, how many were interesting to the attackers?\n\nThis is difficult to estimate, mostly because of the lack of visibility and because the\nattackers were really careful in hiding their traces. Based on the CNAME records\npublished by FireEye, we identified only two entities, a US government organization\nand a telecommunications company, who were tagged and “promoted” to dedicated\nC2s for additional exploitation.\n8. Why didn’t you catch this supply chain attack in the first place?\n\nThat’s a good question! In particular, two things made it really stealthy. The slow\ncommunication method, in which the malware lies dormant for up to two weeks, is one\nof them. The other one is the lack of x86 shellcode; the attackers used a .NET injected\nmodule. Last but not least, there was no significant change in the file size of the\nmodule when the malicious code was added. We observed two suspicious modules in\n2019, which jumped from the usual 500k to 900k for\nSolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll. When the malicious code was first added, in\nFebruary 2020, the file didn’t change size in a significant manner. If the attackers did\nthis on purpose, to avoid future detections, then it’s a pretty impressive thing.\n9. What is Teardrop?\n\nAccording to FireEye, Teardrop is malware delivered by the attackers to some of the\nvictims. It is an unknown memory-only dropper suspected to deliver a customized\nversion of the well-known CobaltStrike BEACON. To date, we haven’t detected any\nTeardrop samples anywhere.\n10. What made this such a successful operation?\n\nProbably, a combination of things – a supply chain attack, coupled with a very well\nthought first stage implant, careful victim selection strategies and last but not least, no\nobvious connections to any previously observed TTPs.\n\n[Backdoor](https://securelist.com/tag/backdoor/)\n[Malware Descriptions](https://securelist.com/tag/malware-descriptions/)\n[Malware Technologies](https://securelist.com/tag/malware-technologies/)\n[Sunburst](https://securelist.com/tag/sunburst/)\n[Supply-chain attack](https://securelist.com/tag/supply-chain-attack/)\n[Targeted attacks](https://securelist.com/tag/targeted-attacks/)\n\nAuthors\n\nIgor Kuznetsov\n\n[Costin Raiu](https://securelist.com/author/costin/)\n\nSunburst: connecting the dots in the DNS requests\n\n\n-----\n\nYour email address will not be published.
