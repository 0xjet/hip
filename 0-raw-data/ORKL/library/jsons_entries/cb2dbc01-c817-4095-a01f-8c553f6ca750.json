Using this domain knowledge,\ndefenders and researchers can make inferences during day-to-day analysis such as the\nend point of a campaign or whether or not a particular sample is still dangerous.\nAdditionally, DomainTools researchers provide a working method for enumerating\ninfrastructure based on nameserver activity.\n\n## Background\n\n[In the past six months, DomainTools researchers have investigated multiple campaigns](https://www.domaintools.com/resources/blog/current-events-to-widespread-campaigns-pivoting-from-samples-to-identify)\n[from the entity known as Cloud Atlas or Inception. As mentioned prior, Cloud Atlas’](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0100/)\ntargeting spans a number of government entities and industries, primarily in parts of the\nformer Soviet Union and Europe, but has been actively seen across Asia, North America,\n[and the Middle East as well. Cloud Atlas makes use of template injection to load malicious](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1221)\npayloads on victim systems and spread their C2 infrastructure across a variety of cloud\nproviders which makes tracking their activities a bit more difficult.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Nameserver Movement\n\nOn May 26, DomainTools researchers observed previously known Cloud Atlas domains\ntransitioning their NS records from bitdomain[.]biz to one of three new nameservers that\neach contain roughly 150 domains that the DomainTools data science team’s risk scoring\nrates at a high risk for maliciousness. The original nameserver, bitdomain[.]biz, belongs to a\ndiscount hosting provider that accepts Bitcoin for payment, a common feature in APT group\nhosting provider choice. A number of unrelated domains exist on bitdomain[.]biz so this is\nnot exclusive to Cloud Atlas and neither is the movement to these other nameservers.\n\nThe movement between nameservers can be indicative of a number of things, but first and\nforemost movement means that there was interaction with the domain as someone or some\nprocess had to change the record. Many malicious domains, after use, are left to become\nstale but a domain moving between nameservers indicates that there is another intent left\nfor that domain. This could be the final steps in a well organized campaign’s cleanup\nprocess, a further aging of the domain for other campaigns in the future, or movement to\nother infrastructure for a myriad reasons.\n\nSince these domains are each less than 100 days old, they have not yet expired on their\n[original registration, so this isn’t a “drop catch” situation. These nameservers also do not](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_drop_catching)\n[belong to any sinkholes that DomainTools researchers are aware of at this time. Lastly, the](https://github.com/brakmic/Sinkholes)\ntwo-by-two pairing seems like an odd pattern since one would assume sinkhole\ninfrastructure would keep domains from the same campaign on the same servers for\nmeasuring telemetry.\n\n## Examining New Nameservers\n\nThe domains behind these new nameservers, which Cloud Atlas has not previously been\nseen using, are well aged between the three of them with over five and a half years for an\naverage age. With youth being a heavy indicator in maliciousness prediction products\nacross the cyber threat intelligence industry, many threat actors have begun turning to well\naged domain reseller services or trying to catch domains that have recently dropped from\ntheir registration. A prime example of this could be the avsvmcloud[.]com domain used in\n[the high-profile SolarWinds supply chain compromise earlier this year. In this case, we have](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-with-sunburst-backdoor.html)\na long, contiguous set of ownership records in historical Whois for the domains attached to\nthese nameservers so none of the above possibilities seem to fit here\n\n\n-----\n\nThe top IP address looks to belong to a domain parking provider that has been around\nsince 2010. However, the bottom two addresses point to Amazon EC2 nodes that are\nrunning just DNS services on port 53, acting as a DNS forwarding service -- a sign this may\nbe an unknown sinkhole. Digging into a history of domains that have resided on these\n[nameservers ties them to other maliciousness, such as the .NET RAT SamoRAT’s domain](https://otx.alienvault.com/pulse/5ec9fd16d0a270565b8566fe)\nsamorat[.]com which resides on newregs-domain[.]com until May 19, 2021 or the domain\n[360mediashare[.]com seen distributing another RAT via phishing emails in late 2020. In](https://otx.alienvault.com/pulse/5ec9fd16d0a270565b8566fe)\nfact, the same goes for the domain-transition1[.]com nameserver which hosts domains such\n[as porkhalal[.]site which the Zusy banking trojan has been](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2017/03/threat-roundup-0313-0317.html) [observed using for C2 and](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/domain/porkhalal.site/relations)\nalhajikudi[.]com which has been observed in traffic of [other malware samples in early 2021.](https://otx.alienvault.com/pulse/6094924f0129504fc1b1ac31)\n\nAs DomainTools researchers looked further into these nameservers and the domains\ncontained on them, it became apparent that this must be a domain reseller network or a\nsinkhole telemetry network due to the large swath of known malicious domains transitioning\nthrough these nameservers over time. DomainTools’ own proximity risk scoring rated all of\nthese related domains an average of 80 due simply to their proximity to known malicious\ninfrastructure on industry standard blocklists. Typically, in the experience of DomainTools\nresearchers, a scoring above 70 means that a domain should not be trusted and should be\ninvestigated further. It became apparent that mapping this network would be a useful\nexercise.\n\n## Looking For More Nameservers\n\n[With these bottom two domains there is a pattern we can treat as a composite object for](https://www.domaintools.com/resources/blog/analyzing-network-infrastructure-as-composite-objects)\nhunting additional infrastructure:\n\nThey have nameservers that are hosted on the domain themselves.\nThis domain is hosted on Amazon’s AWS on an EC2 node.\nThe domain contains a dash.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe emails in the Whois record have both privacyprotect[.]org and bigrock[.]com in the\nrecord.\n\n[Searching for these features in the DomainTools Iris Investigate data set reveals a total of 5](https://www.domaintools.com/products/iris?utm_source=Blog&utm_campaign=Cloud-Atlas-Navigates-Us-Into-New-Waters)\nadditional domains that DomainTools researchers can say with high confidence belong to\nthe same clustering:\n\nNote the misspelling in suspended-domians[.]com. Expanding on these nameservers\nreveals just over 1,086 domains, most of which have been involved in some sort of\ncybercrime activity in the past. Of those 1,086 domains none of them had a reseller page\nwhen navigating to the domain which domain resale companies use to signal that the\ndomain is for sale. Lastly, DomainTools Research noticed that all of the domains associated\nwith those nameservers pointed to one of 3 IP addresses, spread across all nameservers,\nthat definitively tied this clustering together.\n\n\n-----\n\n**IPs of Nameserver Cluster**\n\n\n18.235.92[.]123\n\n\n50.17.5[.]224\n\n\n54.227.98[.]220\n\n\nInverting the search from nameserver properties to solely A records reveals a single site as\nan outlier: dropbox-download[.]com. It is an outlier because it contains a different\nnameserver in domain-imminent3[.]com, a naming schema nearly identical to one of the\nnameservers associated with the original Cloud Atlas movement at the beginning of this\nreport, domain-imminent[.]com. Of note is that the dropbox-download[.]com domain here is\n[associated with TA505, the group behind the Dridex banking trojan, from a campaign they](https://otx.alienvault.com/pulse/5d78dc8a0006495d5fb9296e)\nran over two years ago.\n\nViewing all domains on domain-imminent3[.]com, repeating the process from above, reveals\nanother common IP address (52.6.206[.]192) spanning multiple new nameservers including\ndomain-imminent1[.]com, domain-imminent2[.]com. The inclusion of these final two\nnameservers contain a recent lapse in privacy protection on the Whois record and an email\naddress of resellerclub@protonmail[.]com that is tied to them.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis email in historical Whois records ties to 20 records total that span most of the\nnameservers DomainTools researches enumerated. On top of that, many of the domains in\nthat group—including elsewhere in the list of total domains—move to the nameservers at\nfoundationapi[.]com at one point or another, a property of Endurance International Group, a\ncompany in the domain and web services space that owns a number of properties including\nBigRock, HostGator, and ResellerClub.\n\n\n-----\n\nResellerClub allows for the bulk resale of domains. Searching on their documentation you\ncan see the use of foundationapi[.]com as a backend as well as the services and pricing\nthey offer for bulk domain purchases.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n## The Domain Swamp\n\nExpanding across the domains tied to all nameservers there are a total of 1,378 domains,\n559 of which are on known industry blocklists for malware and on average score above 80\nin the DomainTools Risk Score engine. Going through those 1,378 domains, none could be\nfound on domain auction sites or for sale, so this further backs up the potential that this is a\nsinkhole network run by the Endurance International Group or one of their subsidiaries. To\nshow the broad swath of domains and campaigns associated, DomainTools researchers\ncoupled one nameserver’s holdings, domain-imminent1[.]com, with Alienvault OTX pulses\nbelow.\n\n**Domain**

this point DomainTools researchers are led to believe that these nameservers are a\nholding pen for known malicious domains on the reseller network until they can be resold or\nare actively being used as a sinkhole by the reseller network for telemetry. Since\nDomainTools researchers cannot find a description of the sinkhole network or any of that\ntelemetry being posted elsewhere online, defenders can only assume that this is a private\nsinkhole network associated with Endurance.\n\n## Lessons for Defenders\n\nIf you are an analyst working with malicious software or mapping adversary infrastructure,\nknowing of these dead zones in domain data so that you do not get distracted by them\nwhen trying to map live infrastructure is key to efficiently researching threats. For threat\nhunters, watching the transitioning of domains on and off these nameservers, through a tool\n[like the DomainTools Nameserver Monitor, can provide ample domains for hunting queries](https://www.domaintools.com/products/monitoring?utm_source=Blog&utm_campaign=Cloud-Atlas-Navigates-Us-Into-New-Waters)\non public repositories of malicious binaries and lead to pivots of fresh, un-sinkholed\ninfrastructure.\n\n## Nameserver List\n```\ndomain-imminent[.]com\ndomain-imminent1[.]com\ndomain-imminent2[.]com\ndomain-imminent3[.]com\ndomain-transition1[.]com\ndomain-transition2[.]com\ndomain-transition3[.]com\ndomains-green[.]com\nsuspended-domians[.]com\nnewregs-domain[.]com\n\n```\nIris Search Hash for All Domains On These Nameservers:\n```\nU2FsdGVkX19inpzBsHU8tDBrjLPfcJTcmLc+O13CCJpuRlnDdlUogNF5k0NIqexuO4v7GkilkMrvqup8FVTtM\n\n```\n\n-----",
