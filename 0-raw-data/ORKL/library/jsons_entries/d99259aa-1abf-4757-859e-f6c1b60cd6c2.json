In fact, German authorities recently\nwarned about phishing emails trying to take advantage of those infamous bugs.\n\nWe identified a recently registered domain that is offering an information page with various\nlinks to external resources about Meltdown and Spectre and how it affects processors. While\nit appears to come from the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI), this SSLenabled phishing site is not affiliated with any legitimate or official government entity.\n\n\n-----\n\nMoreover, the same fraudulent domain has a link to a ZIP archive (Intel-AMD-SecurityPatch_11-01bsi.zip) containing the so-called patch (Intel-AMD-SecurityPatch-10-1-v1.exe), which_\nreally is a piece of malware.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Upon running it, users will infect themselves with Smoke Loader, a piece of malware that can](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2016/08/smoke-loader-downloader-with-a-smokescreen-still-alive/)\nretrieve additional payloads. Post-infection traffic shows the malicious file attempting to\nconnect to various domains and sending encrypted information:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe [Subject Alternative Name field within the abused SSL certificate shows other properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject_Alternative_Name)\nassociated with the .bid domain, including one that is a German template for a fake Adobe\nFlash Player update.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe immediately contacted Comodo and CloudFlare to report on this abuse and within\nminutes the site did not resolve anymore thanks to CloudFlare’s quick response.\nMalwarebytes users were already protected at zero-hour against this malware.\n\n\n-----\n\nOnline criminals are notorious for taking advantage of publicized events and rapidly\nexploiting them, typically via phishing campaigns. This particular one is interesting because\npeople were told to apply a patch, which is exactly what the crooks are offering under\ndisguise.\n\nIt’s always important to be cautious, especially when urged to perform an action (i.e. calling\nMicrosoft on a toll-free number, or updating a piece of software) because there’s a chance\nthat such requests are fake and intended to either scam you or infect your computer. There\nare very few legitimate cases when vendors will directly contact you to apply updates. If that\nis the case, it’s always good to verify this information via other online resources or friends\nfirst.\n\nAlso, remember that sites using HTTPS aren’t necessarily trustworthy. The presence of a\ncertificate simply implies that the data that transits between your computer and the site is\nsecure, but that has nothing to do with the intentions or content offered, which could be a\ntotal scam.\n\n## Indicators of compromise\n\nFraudulent site:\n```\nsicherheit-informationstechnik[.]bid\n\n```\nFake patch (Smoke Loader):\n```\nsicherheit-informationstechnik.bid/Download/Sicherheitsupdate/Intel-AMDSecurityPatch-11-01bsi.zip\nCD17CE11DF9DE507AF025EF46398CFDCB99D3904B2B5718BFF2DC0B01AEAE38C\n\n```\nSmoke Loader callbacks:\n```\ncoolwater-ltd-supportid[.]ru\nlocalprivat-support[.]ru\nservice-consultingavarage[.]ru\n\n```\n\n-----",
