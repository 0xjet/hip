    "plain_text": "# APT10 was managed by the Tianjin bureau of the Chinese Ministry of State Security\n\n**intrusiontruth.wordpress.com/2018/08/15/apt10-was-managed-by-the-tianjin-bureau-of-the-chinese-ministry-of-state-**\nsecurity/\n\nintrusiontruth August 15, 2018\n\nIn previous posts, Intrusion Truth showed that the Cloud Hopper / APT10 hackers that\nattacked thousands of global clients of Managed Service Providers (MSPs) in 2016 were\nbased in Tianjin, China.\n\nWe identified Zheng Yanbin, Gao Qiang and Zhang Shilong as three actors responsible. We\nassociated them with the Huaying Haitai Science and Technology Development Co Ltd (天津\n华盈海泰科技发展有限公司) and Laoying Baichen Instruments Equipment Co Ltd in Tianjin\nChina. But we haven’t yet explained who was masterminding or controlling the attacks.\n\nIn the course of our investigation over the last year, we engaged with several Cyber Threat\nIntelligence analysts who provided both raw data and analysis to our team. Amongst the data\nprovided to us recently was evidence that Gao Qiang has been working with the Chinese\nstate. The key piece of data was an Uber journey.\n\n**Journeys to 85 Zhujiang Road**\n\n强’s travel from work at Huaying Haitai to Xiqing District.\nThis image, which was provided by an analyst who prefers not to be named publicly (but\nwhose identity we have independently verified), shows an Uber receipt addressed to a user\ncalled ‘Qiang’ (强) and bears the e-mail address 420192[at]qq.com, an account that we\nbelieve to be used by APT10 actor Gao Qiang.\n\nThe receipt shows travel at the end of the working day between 384 Jiefang South Road (解\n放南路) – immediately outside the Fuyu Mansion address of Huaying Haitai – and a\ndestination in what appears to be a residential area of the Xiqing District of Tianjin just south\nof the Waihuan River. We have blacked out the exact street number in the image. This map\nshows the location of the start of the journey, outside the Fuyu Mansion buildings.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nThe collection address outside the Fuyu Mansion Buildings, home of Huaying Haitai\nThis second Uber receipt, provided by the same analyst, shows further travel by the same\nuser, though here he uses the name ‘Pig’ (猪). This could be some attempt to disguise the\nnature of the journey, though readers will note the same QQ e-mail address is used.\n\n猪’s travel between Xiqing District and 85 Zhujiang Road\nIn this case the journey is between the same residential area in the Xiqing District and a\nlarge complex at 85 Zhujiang Road (珠江道), Tianjin.\n\nAccording to the rest of the data revised by analysts working for this blog, this was one of a\nnumber of journeys made by the user to/from the same complex on Zhujiang Road.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n**Tianjin State Security Bureau**\n\n[85 Zhujiang Road is an important address in Tianjin – it is the headquarters of the Tianjin](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%A4%A9%E6%B4%A5%E5%B8%82%E5%9B%BD%E5%AE%B6%E5%AE%89%E5%85%A8%E5%B1%80)\nState Security Bureau (天津市国家安全局), a regional arm of the Ministry of State Security\n(MSS). MSS is the same Chinese Intelligence Service that was tasking APT3 via a cover\ncompany managed by its office in Guangdong.\n\nThe large complex visited by Gao Qiang at 85 Zhujiang Road, Tianjin\nThis looks like what it is – an exact copy of the APT3 model. This was a large scale\ninfiltration of western infrastructure conducted by a team of Chinese citizens working for a\nsmall company with links to the Chinese Intelligence Service, MSS. It is the second time that\n\n\n-----\n\nthis blog has proven a link between a damaging APT group and the Chinese state (and it\ncertainly won’t be the last).\n\n**The conclusion?**\n\nEither:\n\nsomeone with the same name as an apparent APT10 hacker,\n\ntravelled from the same building as an APT10 associated company, and\n\n_met frequently with the Ministry of State Security in Tianjin._\n\nOr:\n\n**APT10 was the work of the Chinese Ministry of State Security.**\n\n\n-----",
