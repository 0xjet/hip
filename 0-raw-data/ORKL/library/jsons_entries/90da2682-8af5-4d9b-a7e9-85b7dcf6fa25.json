After the Second World War, there were several\ngangs in Moscow that engaged in robberies and committed murders. Criminals that\nremained at large hiding from the police often switched from a disrupted gang to another or\ncreated new groups.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe often see something similar among cyber criminals. Despite numerous arrests of people\ninvolved in ransomware activity as well as the shutdown of some affiliate programs,\nransomware remains threat No. 1. Ransomware attacks continue to be conducted around\nthe world, with underground forums teeming with posts about selling “access” and hiring\n“penetration testers”.\n\nThere is no doubt in the security community that the former members of DarkSide,\n**BlackMatter, and REvil have formed the core of ALPHV, a more mature (due to their**\nexperience) and sophisticated affiliate program. Security researchers unofficially call it\n**BlackCat for its use of two logos: a black cat and a knife dripping with blood. ALPHV**\nmembers later attempted to move away from romanticizing crime by changing the design of\ntheir logo, but the name BlackCat has stuck.\n\nDespite its short history, the group has conducted about 140 attacks worldwide over the\ncourse of six months and has set a new direction for the development of extortion-related\ncrime. Many affiliate programs, such as Hive, started mimicking and adopting the methods\nand approaches of BlackCat. This blog post describes the details of this affiliate program\nand analyzes what exactly affiliates do after obtaining access to the networks of their victims.\n\n## INTRO from ALPHV\n\nALPHV started its activity in December 2021, when a campaign to attract new affiliates\nstarted to be advertised on underground forums:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Description of the affiliate program on an underground forum_\n\n**INTRO**\n\nWelcome to our affiliate program.\n\nWe’ve taken into account all the advantages and weaknesses of previous affiliate programs\nand are proud to present to you ALPHV, a new generation of ransomware.\n\nAll the software has been developed from scratch, with decentralization of all web resources\nensured architecturally. A unique onion domain is generated for every new campaign. Every\naffiliate has access through a unique onion domain (hello lockbit).\n\nA proprietary data center for storing file leaks bigger than 100 TB.\n\nTop recovery companies, which have worked with darkside, revil, etc. are already\ncollaborating with us.\n\nChat support is available 24/7, but you can negotiate yourself if you’d like.\n\n**SECURITY**\n\nWe are fully prepared for present-day conditions, complying with all infrastructure and\naffiliate security requirements. Our affiliate program architecturally rules out any connections\nwith forums(hello revil), has algorithms for data self-deletion after a certain time, and has an\nintegrated mixer with an actual break in the chain(not to be confused with Wasabi, BitMix,\nand others), as you get perfectly clean coins from foreign exchanges. Our backend does not\nknow the wallets your coins are sent to. The infrastructure is divided into “nodes”, which are\ninterconnected via an entire network of intermediaries within the onion network and are\nlocated behind NAT+FW.\n\nEven after receiving a full-on cmdshell, the attacker cannot reveal the real IP address of the\nserver (hello conti)\n\n**ACCOUNT**\n\nIf your account has not been active for two weeks, it will be locked, then deleted. Inorder to\navoid that, we recommend notifying the admins about vacations, breaks, etc.\n\nRates are dynamic and depend on the size of a single payment for each company, namely:\n\n- Up to $1.5M - 80%\n\n\n-----\n\n- Up to $3.0M - 85%\n\n- $3M and more - 90%\nIn this campaign, potential affiliates were offered a brand new kind of ransomware family\ndeveloped “from scratch” in the Rust programming language, which is a popular crossplatform programming language for creating secure and effective applications. The use of\nRust to create ransomware was a major event in the world of cybercrime.\n\n_Description of the BlackCat ransomware family_\n\n**SOFTWARE**\n\nThe software has been developed from scratch without using any templates or leaked source\ncodes of other ransomware. You can choose between:\n\n4 encryption modes:\n\n-Full - full file encryption. The most secure and the slowest.\n\n-Fast - encryption of the first N megabytes. Not recommended, the least secure option, but\nthe fastest.\n\n-DotPattern - encryption of N megabytes with an M interval. May function worse than Fast in\nterms of both speed and encryption strength if configured incorrectly.\n\n-Auto. Depending on the file type and size, the locker(both in windows and *nix / esxi)\nchooses the most optimal(in terms of the speed / security ratio) strategy for processing files.\n\n\n-----\n\n-SmartPattern - encryption of N megabytes with a percentage interval. By default, it encrypts\nwith 10-megabyte blocks with an interval of 10% of the file starting with the header. The most\noptimal mode in terms of the speed\\encryption strength ratio.\n\n2 encryption algorithms:|\n\n-ChaCha20\n\n-AES\nIn auto mode, the software determines the presence of hardware support for AES(present in\nall modern processors) and uses it. If there is no AES support, the software encrypts files\nusing ChaCha20.\n\nThe software is cross-platform, i.e., if you mount Windows disks in Linux or vice versa, the\ndecryptor will be able to decrypt files.\nSupported OSs\n\n- The entire Windows line from Windows 7 and above (we tested it on 7, 8.1, 10, 11, 2008r2,\n2012, 2016, 2019, 2022 ); XP and 2003 can be encrypted through SMB.\n\n- ESXI (tested on 5.5, 6.5, 7.0.2u)\n\n- Debian (tested on 7, 8, 9)\n\n- Ubuntu (tested on 18.04, 20.04)\n\n- ReadyNAS, Synology\nIt was clear from the very beginning of the new RaaS program that its creators were not new\nto the criminal business and took into account the negative experience of their predecessors,\nnamely the DarkSide, BlackMatter and REvil affiliate programs. After their notorious attacks\nagainst major companies, these groups came under the spotlight of security researchers and\nlaw enforcers, who, together with samples, obtained access to victims’ personal pages\ncontaining correspondence with threat actors, where they often interfered.\n\n_Information about using access tokens_\n\nSince binaries have been leaking to analysts lately, and VT premium lets you download\nsamples and get readmes, random people may appear in chats and disrupt negotiations\n(hello darkside), when launching the software you MUST use the flag --access-token.\ncmdline arguments are not passed to AVs, which will ensure that your correspondence with\nthe victim is confidential. For the same reason, every encrypted computer generates a\nunique ID used for dividing chats.\n\n\n-----\n\nThere is a feature for uploading files from the MEGA service, you provide a link to files and\nthey are automatically uploaded to your servers.\n\nThe complete description of all features can be found in the FAQ section.\n\nTo avoid previous mistakes, the BlackCat authors fitted ransomware with a mandatory\ncommand line parameter containing an access token, which is provided by the RaaS\nowners to their affiliates together with their ransomware suite.\n\nThe ransomware uses the access token to calculate determine the access key, which is\nadded to a Tor link for the victim to access their page.\n\n_Contents of the help text file provided to RaaS affiliates_\n\nThis link is saved in the ransom note, which is created as a text file in each catalog with\nencrypted files.\n\n_Ransom note_\n\nWhen victims publish information from their chats, BlackCat affiliates punish them by\nincreasing ransom demands, for example. At the start of their activity, the threat actors were\neven more radical; for instance, they deleted the victim’s encryption keys to intimidate future\n\n\n-----\n\nvictims.\n\n_Information about deleting the encryption keys of a victim published by BlackCat operators_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Victim’s personal page_\n\n## Extortion\n\nBlackCat affiliates use the double and triple extortion techniques. Firstly, the stolen\ninformation is published on BlackCat’s dedicated leak site (DLS). Secondly, to mount\npressure on the victim, BlackCat affiliates may threaten to send sensitive data to the victim’s\n\n\n-----\n\ncompetitors, partners, or customers, mass media, law enforcement, etc. Thirdly, the victim\nmay receive threats of a DDoS attack being launched against their infrastructure.\n\n_Chat with a victim_\n\nAt the time of writing, the stolen documents of 93 affected companies that refused to pay a\nransom were published on BlackCat’s DLS. We estimate that the overall number of BlackCat\nvictims since December 2021 is about 140.\n\n\n-----\n\n_BlackCat's DLS_\n\n## The tactics, techniques and procedures of BlackCat ransomware affiliates\n\nTo reconstruct the lifecycle of a BlackCat attack, we use the Unified Ransomware Kill Chain\n[described in Incident Response Techniques for Ransomware Attacks.](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09VCM6FWD/)\n**Gaining Access to the Network**\n\nSince a single affiliate program may involve different threat actors, techniques used for\nobtaining initial access may differ. Further, affiliates may use the services of initial access\nbrokers, who sell access to companies’ compromised infrastructures.\n\nAs part of investigating security incidents, we have seen the following techniques:\n\n1\n\n**Exploiting public-facing applications.**\n\n\n-----\n\nThis technique gained popularity in 2021 among both affiliates and initial access brokers due\nto a lot of vulnerabilities being discovered that allowed arbitrary code execution in a variety of\napplications. In the case of BlackCat, the attackers exploited a set of vulnerabilities known as\nProxyShell (CVE-2021-34473, CVE-2021-34523, CVE-2021-31207), which enabled them to\nplace a web shell on a vulnerable Microsoft Exchange server and then conduct postexploitation activities.\n\n2\n\n**Using remote access tools.**\n\nAccess via publicly accessible terminal servers remains the most popular technique for\ngaining initial access and BlackCat affiliates used it in some cases. In addition to terminal\nservers, access to the target infrastructure could be gained via a VPN; many organizations\nstill do not use multifactor authentication, which enables ransomware operators to easily use\naccounts whose data have been stolen using stealers, for example.\n\n**Establishing Foothold**\n\nHaving obtained initial access, the attackers copy a set of tools (in full or in part) to the\ncompromised host and seek to ensure persistence and gain access to privileged accounts to\nbe able to move across the network.\n\nTo have additional capabilities to access the compromised network, the attackers could use\ntunnels (built using ngrok or gost) or legitimate software (such as TeamViewer or\n**ScreenConnect).**\n\nIn some cases, affiliates used Cobalt Strike, a framework that many are already used to\nseeing when investigating ransomware attacks.\n\nIn most incidents, BlackCat affiliates relied on legitimate tools to extract authentication data\nby dumping the LSASS (Local Security Authority Server Service) process. For instance, the\nthreat actors used ProcDump and exploited the MiniDump feature of the legitimate library\n**comsvcs.dll.**\n\nSometimes the attackers went beyond LSASS and used various NirSoft tools to extract\nauthentication data from the registry, web browsers, and other storage spaces.\n**Network Discovery**\n\nAffiliates seldom used innovative methods at the data collection stage, relying on classic\ntools. For instance, to scan the network, the attackers used SoftPerfect Network Scanner,\nwhich is another tool many ransomware groups use extensively.\n\nTo collect information about Active Directory, the attackers used ADRecon, a tool that is\npopular among REvil and BlackMatter affiliates.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition, the NS tool was used to collect data about available local and network drives.\nThe tool was especially popular with those affiliates that used terminal servers to gain initial\naccess.\n**Key Assets Discovery, Network Propagation and Data Exfiltration**\n\nWith enough privileges in the target IT infrastructure, the attackers start moving to key\nnodes, which will enable them to download the most important information and do away with\nbackups.\n\nTo move across the network, affiliates may use both perfectly legitimate techniques (such as\n**RDP) and noisier ones (e.g., Impacket: wmiexec and smbexec in particular; and Cobalt**\n**Strike).**\n\n**PuTTY is often used to gain access to the part of the infrastructure running on Linux.**\n\nBefore being exfiltrated, data is put into archives using 7-Zip, then uploaded to the MEGA\nfile sharing service using the Rclone utility. In addition, in some cases affiliates used\n**ExMatter, an exfiltration tool that has earlier been seen in the arsenal of BlackMatter**\naffiliate program members.\n**Deployment Preparation**\n\nBlackCat ransomware deployment is preceded by the erasure or encryption of available\nbackup copies and collection of additional credentials that would allow the attackers to infect\nthe Linux segment, in addition to Windows.\n\nDespite the detectability of BlackCat samples not being high, some affiliates seek to disable\nantivirus software before moving on to the deployment stage.\n**Ransomware Deployment**\n\nThe propagation of BlackCat in the victim’s IT infrastructure is achieved by either modifying\ngroup policies (which results in a scheduled task being created, on each host, that launches\nthe malicious file) or using PsExec.\n\nThe ransomware is written in Rust. Many researchers rightfully consider BlackCat as one of\nthe most sophisticated ransomware groups out there at the moment. BlackCat programs are\nfeature-rich and offer flexible custom settings due to the use of various configuration data\nand command line arguments.\n\nThere are BlackCat versions for Windows (32bit) and Linux (32bit and 64bit). The 64bit Linux\nversion primarily targets ESXi servers. In March 2022, a new version of BlackCat emerged,\ncalled ALPHV MORPH. On underground forums its authors proudly claimed that thanks to\nobfuscation, antivirus software is practically unable to detect it.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Description of ALPHV MORPHV features on an underground forum_\n\n**LOCKER**\n\n1. We are proud to present ALPHV MORPH. Without going into the spicy details, we inform\nthat the binary is completely cleared every hour. In addition to recrypting calls, stings, and\nother things, the RUST compiler makes it possible to enrich every build with unique runtime\njunk, which in the end yielded fantastic results. At the moment, no AV detects it(not to be\nconfused with edr! we did not test it on sentinel), including defender with the cloud disabled –\nthe binary is not deleted even after the machine is fully encrypted. In test mode so far,\nintentionally(!), it is available to everyone via Build->Obfuscated. In the future, this\nfunctionality will only be available to affiliates with the + status.\n\n2. Minor fixes in the locker’s operation.\n\np.s. There is no AV for ESXI yet, but we already have a linux polymorph :) That’s right, linux\nis also morphed every hour just because we can.\n\nIt has been mentioned before that launching BlackCat ransomware requires specifying the\nvalue of an access token in the command line parameter — access-token. In earlier\nversions, whether the token value is correct is not checked in any way, while the access key\nis calculated using the entered token value; the program will be launched and files will be\nencrypted, but accessing the victim’s panel would be impossible. In the ALPHV MORPH\nversion, the first 16 characters of the access token are used as a key to decrypt configuration\ndata, which is why if incorrect data is entered, the ransomware will not start.\n\nTo bypass User Account Control (UAC), BlackCat escalates privileges using the ICMLuaUtil\nCOM interface. In addition, privileges can be escalated using the Masquerade PEB method.\nBlackCat ransomware may attempt to authenticate using stolen credentials contained in\nconfiguration data.\n\nWhen launched, BlackCat allows symbolic links from a deleted item to local and remote\nitems:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nfsutil behavior set SymlinkEvaluation R2L:1\n\nfsutil behavior set SymlinkEvaluation R2R:1\n\n```\nStops IIS by executing the following command:\n```\niisreset.exe /stop\n\n```\nDeletes volume shadow copies:\n```\nvssadmin.exe Delete Shadows /all /quiet\n\nwmic.exe Shadowcopy Delete\n\n```\nDisables recovery in Windows boot menu:\n```\nbcdedit /set {default}\n\nbcdedit /set {default} recoveryenabled No\n\n```\nClears Windows event logs:\n```\nfor /F \"tokens=*\" %1 in ('wevtutil.exe el') DO wevtutil.exe cl \"%1\"\n\n```\nIn addition, the ransomware ends processes and stops services specified in the\nconfiguration.\n\nIt should be noted that BlackCat for Windows can independently propagate itself in the local\narea network as a network worm. To do so, the legitimate PsExec utility contained in the\nbody of the ransomware is used together with stolen credentials specified in the\nconfiguration.\n\nFile encryption is multi-threaded. The AES 128 CTR or ChaCha20 algorithm can be used too\nencrypt file contents depending on the settings, with nonce vectors containing 8 or 12 null\nbytes respectively. In addition, various file encryption modes can be used; below are their\nbrief descriptions.\n\n\n-----\n\nAvailable command line parameters\n\nBlackCat configuration data is contained in the body of the ransomware in the JSON format.\nIn earlier BlackCat versions, the configuration data was in plain text, while in the latest\nversions (ALPHV MORPH), it is stored in an encrypted form (AES-128 CTR). For decryption,\nthe first 16 characters of the access token are used as the key. If the characters are entered\nincorrectly, the ransomware will not be able to run due to a configuration data error.\n\n_Formatted BlackCat configuration data_\n\nIt must be noted that despite some of the group’s methods being sophisticated, many tactics,\ntechniques and procedures employed by BlackCat affiliates can be easily detected, which\nindicates serious flaws in organizations’ security systems as well as a shortage of skilled\n\n\n-----\n\nsecurity specialists.\n\n**Additional information**\n\nMITRE ATT&CK\n\nRansomware Uncovered\n\n2021/2022\n\nThe well-known complete guide to the latest tactics, techniques, and procedures of\nransomware operators based on MITRE ATT&CK®\n\nDownload the report\n\n\n-----",
