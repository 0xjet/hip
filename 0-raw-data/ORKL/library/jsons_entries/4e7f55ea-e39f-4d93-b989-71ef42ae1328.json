Sources include Recorded Future’s platform, VirusTotal,_\n_ReversingLabs, and third-party metadata, as well as common OSINT and_\n_network metadata enrichments, such as DomainTools Iris and PassiveTotal._\n_This research is part of a series highlighting the breadth of sophisticated_\n_techniques used by the Chinese state against perceived domestic threats._\n\n## Executive Summary\n\n[Following our research uncovering the Chinese RedAlpha campaigns targeting](https://www.recordedfuture.com/redalpha-cyber-campaigns/)\nthe Tibetan community, Recorded Future’s Insikt Group identified a novel Linux\nbackdoor called “ext4,” deployed against the same Tibetan victim group. By\nanalyzing the backdoor, we uncovered repeated attempted connections to the\nsame compromised CentOS web server emanating from infrastructure\nregistered to Tsinghua University, an elite Chinese academic institution.1\n\nWe also identified network reconnaissance activities being conducted from the\nsame Tsinghua University infrastructure targeting many geopolitical\norganizations, including the State of Alaska Government, Alaska’s Department\nof Natural Resources, the United Nations office in Nairobi, and the Kenya Ports\nAuthority. Additionally, we identified the targeted scanning of German\n\n\n-----\n\nautomotive multinational Daimler AG that began a day after it cut its profit\noutlook for the year, citing the growing trade tensions between the U.S. and\nChina. In several cases, these activities occurred during periods of Chinese\ndialogue for economic cooperation with these countries or organizations.\n\nWe assess with medium confidence that the network reconnaissance activities\nwe uncovered were conducted by Chinese state-sponsored actors in support of\nChina’s economic development goals.\n\n## Key Judgments\n\nTsinghua IP 166.111.8[.]246 engaged in network reconnaissance\ntargeting organizations in Alaska, Kenya, Brazil, and Mongolia during\ntimes of economic dialogue or publicity around China’s investment in\nforeign infrastructure projects concerning China’s flagship Belt and Road\nInitiative (BRI).\n\nThe network reconnaissance activity against Alaskan organizations\nincreased following the governor of Alaska’s trade delegation trip to China\nin late May. Organizations targeted by the reconnaissance activity were in\nindustries at the heart of the trade discussions, such as oil and gas.\n\nThe targeting of German automotive multinational Daimler AG was\nobserved a day after it announced a profit warning in light of the growing\nU.S. and China trade tensions.\n\nThe Tsinghua IP made at least one attempt to subscribe to a U.S.-based\nhotel’s high-speed internet portal. We assess with low confidence that this\nmay demonstrate an intent to breach Nomadix internet gateways within\nthe hospitality sector running vulnerable WindWeb servers.\n\nThe Tsinghua IP repeatedly attempted to connect with a Tibetan network\nthat was compromised with a highly sophisticated backdoor, “ext4.”\n\n“ext4” only allowed incoming TCP 443 connections to the compromised\nnetwork during a 180-second window every hour, with packets requring a\nunique combination of TCP header options to successfully connect. In\nover 20 observed attempts, the Tsinghua IP did not transmit the correct\nTCP options to activate the backdoor. This suggested:\n\nThe threat actors connecting from the Tsinghua IP were ill-informed of the\ncorrect “ext4” backdoor connection sequence and were making mistakes.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe targeting of the Tibetan network is not associated with the presence\nof the “ext4” backdoor and the network was being probed in line with\nwider geopolitical and economic network reconnaissance activity being\nconducted by the Tsinghua IP.\n\n## Background\n\n[The People’s Republic of China (PRC) claims sovereignty over Tibet and](http://www.china.org.cn/e-white/tibet/)\nregards all Tibetan independence movements as separatist threats. While the\nPRC uses many forms of coercion against the Tibetan community,\ncyberespionage against Tibetan targets has become a frequently used tool,\nespecially during times of heightened tensions. The first known incident of\n[Chinese cyberespionage against Tibet, dubbed GhostNet, was in 2008. This](http://www.nartv.org/mirror/ghostnet.pdf)\nwas part of a wider attempt to monitor foreign targets of national interest. There\nhas since been numerous cyberespionage campaigns documented against\nTibetans, including in Recorded Future’s recent [RedAlpha report.](https://www.recordedfuture.com/redalpha-cyber-campaigns/)\n\n[Tsinghua University is located in the Haidian District in Beijing. Dubbed](http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/thu2018/index.html)\n“China’s MIT,” it is one of China’s premier technical research universities.\nChinese universities have often been associated with Chinese state-sponsored\ncyber capabilities both directly and indirectly. In 2015, APT17 infrastructure was\n[connected to a professor at China’s Southeast University, and in 2017, the](https://www.threatconnect.com/blog/the-anthem-hack-all-roads-lead-to-china/)\n[People’s Liberation Army (PLA) partnered with Xi’An Jiaotong University to](http://news.sina.com.cn/o/2017-07-13/doc-ifyiaewh9001223.shtml)\ncreate a cyber militia program. Tsinghua University is itself a state-owned\ninstitution and is among the world’s [top research and engineering schools. Its](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/tsinghua-university)\nstudents’ offensive cyber capabilities are most famous through Blue-Lotus, a\nsecurity research team composed of Tsinghua University-affiliated individuals.\nThe team [finished second in DEF CON’s 2016 capture the flag competition.](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/baidu-blue-lotus-finishes-2nd-at-defcon-shows-chinas-strength-in-network-security-300310981.html)\n\nResearch branches of Tsinghua University also have connections to state\norganizations with a history of stealing U.S. technology. Tsinghua University’s\nOffice of Scientific Research and Development met with China CITIC Group for\nCommunist Party meeting activities in May 2018, during which they discussed\nstrategic cooperation between enterprises and research institutes to serve the\ndevelopment of the country. In the 1999 Select Committee on U.S. National\nSecurity and Military/Commercial Concerns with the PRC (the so-called “Cox\nReport”), CITIC was linked to PLA covert operations and the theft of sensitive\nU.S. technology. The Cox Report also cited an attempt in 1990 by CITIC to\nacquire a U.S. aircraft parts manufacturer on behalf of the PLA in order to\naccess U.S. export-controlled aerospace technology. Further, CITIC’s former\n[chairman, Wang Zhen, was involved in the 1996 Poly Technologies indictment](https://www.congress.gov/congressional-report/105th-congress/senate-report/167/4)\nstemming from the company’s attempt to smuggle 2,000 Chinese AK-47\nassault rifles into the United States.\n\n\n-----\n\nTsinghua s Institute of Information Systems and Engineering is also openly\n[affiliated with China’s National 863 and 973 programs. The](http://ise.thss.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) 863 Program, also\nknown as the State High-Tech Development Plan, focuses on developing\nnational capabilities within China’s key technological industries, while the 973\nProgram, first established in 1997, focuses on developing the basic\ntechnologies required to achieve technological superiority in the key industries.\nBoth programs have had the effect of making it easier for China to steal\nintellectual property in order to achieve program goals.\n\nIn the past 10 years, a number of Chinese state-sponsored cyber threat actors\nhave been identified conducting widespread cyberespionage directly reflecting\nChina’s [policy directives to gain scientific, technical, and economic advantage](http://www.gov.cn/xinwen/2016-03/17/content_5054992.htm)\nin key strategic industries. This activity can be observed most recently in\n[operations by APT10 targeting managed IT service providers and APT17,](https://www.pwc.co.uk/issues/cyber-security-data-privacy/insights/operation-cloud-hopper.html)\n[which conducted massive supply chain attacks against the popular software](https://www.darkreading.com/endpoint/privacy/chinese-apt-backdoor-found-in-ccleaner-supply-chain-attack/d/d-id/1331250?)\nproduct CCleaner in 2017.\n\nRecorded Future timeline of Tsinghua IP activity in correlation with Tibetan\nprotests.\n\n## Threat Analysis\n\nRecorded Future discovered the presence of the “ext4” backdoor during our\nongoing research into the targeting of the Tibetan community. This backdoor\nwas configured to run on a Linux web server running CentOS and was\n\n\n-----\n\nstealthily designed to be embedded within a system file. The backdoor was\nmostly inactive other than during a three-minute window every hour when it\nwould activate and accept incoming connections on TCP port 443.\n\nIn total, Recorded Future’s unique coverage enabled us to observe 23\nattempted connections to the same compromised CentOS server between May\nand June 2018. Every attempt originated from the same IP, 166.111.8[.]246,\nwhich resolved to the China Education and Research Network Center. WHOIS\nrecords reveal that the IP sits within a large /16 CIDR range registered to an\naddress at “Tsinghua University.”\n\nA unique selection of options in the TCP header, set at the maximum possible\nsegment size of 60 bytes, were observed in every packet that attempted to\nconnect to the Tibetan network from the Tsinghua IP, as noted in the PCAP\nbelow.\n\nPCAP of connection attempt from Tsinghua IP to compromised Tibetan CentOS\nserver.\n\nThe “ext4” code appears to be unique, with no prominent traces online for code\nor naming similarity. Aside from our submission, no uploads of a backdoor\nresembling the key characteristics of “ext4” were observed in leading multiscanner repositories as of August 3, 2018. A detection ratio of 0/58 in\nVirusTotal confirmed that the “ext4” sample we discovered was a new and\nunique backdoor targeting the Tibetan community.\n\nA detailed analysis of the “ext4” binary can be found in the Technical Analysis\nsection of this report.\n\n**Tsinghua University IP 166.111.8[.]246**\n\nThis IP was first observed in Recorded Future on March 23, 2018, and\nresolved to the Chinese Education and Research Network Center (CERNET),\n[according to several IP enrichment sources. CERNET is one of China’s six](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CERNET)\nmajor backbone networks and is a catchall organization serving a large swath\n\n\n-----\n\nof addressable IP space reserved for Chinese academic and research\ninstitutes. As noted previously, WHOIS records confirm the IP sits within a\nrange registered to “Tsinghua University.”\n\nAvailable port scan data revealed that the IP is currently configured with\n[several actively running services, including PPTP (TCP port 1723),](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-to-Point_Tunneling_Protocol) [MySQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL)\n[(3306), and MAMP (8888), as well as the more common OpenSSH (22),](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAMP) [HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol)\n[(80, 8080, 8008), SSL (443, 8443, 9443), and VPN IKE (500) services, among](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSL)\nothers. The HTTP ports appeared to be configured as NGINX web servers,\nlikely as reverse proxies or load balancers, given the nature of the activity we\nhave observed from this IP. The large number of open ports and associated\nservices indicate that the Tsinghua IP may be an internet gateway or VPN\nendpoint.\n\nRecorded Future Intelligence Card™ for Tsinghua IP 166.111.8[.]246.\n\n[Recorded Future enrichments of the IP show that it has been the source of](https://www.abuseipdb.com/check/166.111.8.246)\nscanning, brute-force attacks, and active exploitation attempts in the past. It\nhas triggered several risk rules, including being flagged by the Taichung City\nEducation Bureau in Taiwan, which tracks Chinese-originating malicious cyber\n\n\n-----\n\nindicators, and appears in an AlienVault blacklist. Metadata analysis of the IP\nfurther indicates that it is likely a gateway, NAT, or proxy, and that the true\noriginating machine for this activity lies behind this IP.\n\nThe same IP address was also observed conducting large-scale network\nreconnaissance of organizations that were engaged in key trade discussions\nwith Chinese state-owned entities at the time. We believe these\nreconnaissance activities were not coincidental as they align broadly with\nChina’s strategic and economic interests.\n\n**“Opportunity Alaska”**\n\nBetween April 6 and June 24, 2018, we observed over one million IP\nconnections between the Tsinghua IP and several networks in Alaska including:\n\nThe Alaska Communications Systems Group\nAlaska Department of Natural Resources\nAlaska Power & Telephone Company\nState of Alaska Government\nTelAlaska\n\nThe vast number of connections between the Tsinghua IP and the above\norganizations relate to the bulk scanning of ports 22, 53, 80, 139, 443, 769, and\n2816 on the Alaskan networks and were likely conducted to ascertain\nvulnerabilities and gain illegitimate access. The scanning activity was\nconducted in a systematic manner with entire IP ranges dedicated to the\norganizations probed for the above ports.\n\nThis targeting of the the State of Alaska Government followed Alaska’s large\ntrade mission into China dubbed “Opportunity Alaska.” This trade mission\noccurred in late May and was led by Bill Walker, governor of Alaska. During\nthese talks, one of the highest-profile discussions occurred around the prospect\nof a [gas pipeline between Alaska and China. Despite fears of a](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Natural-Gas/Is-A-Natural-Gas-Pipeline-Between-Alaska-And-China-Realistic.html) China-U.S.\ntrade war, Gov. Walker’s office stated that the trade mission “represent[ed]\nsome of the best Alaska has to offer, and... [highlighted] the wide scope of our\nshared interests with our largest trade partner.” Opportunity Alaska consisted of\ndelegates from Alaskan businesses in the fishing, tourism, architecture, and\ninvestment industries, and made stops in Beijing, Shanghai, and Chengdu.\n\n\n-----\n\nNetwork probing events conducted by Tsinghua IP targeting Alaskan\ninstitutions coinciding with Alaskan trade delegation to China in May 2018.\n\nRecorded Future first observed the scanning activity against Alaskan networks\nin late March, only a few weeks after Gov. Walker announced a trade\ndelegation to China. The activity picked up for a few days prior to the\ndelegation arriving on May 20, 2018, and dropped off as the delegation arrived.\nProbing of the Alaskan networks remained at low levels until May 28 as the\ndelegation concluded its activities, then ramped up considerably as delegates\nleft China. The spike in scanning activity at the conclusion of trade discussions\non related topics indicates that the activity was likely an attempt to gain insight\ninto the Alaskan perspective on the trip and strategic advantage in the post-visit\nnegotiations.\n\nThere was a further surge in interest between June 20 and June 24 against the\nState of Alaska and Alaska Department of Natural Resources networks. This\n[was possibly in response to Gov. Walker announcing on June 19 that he](https://www.upi.com/Alaskas-governor-to-issue-plea-to-avert-trade-war/3971529407509/)\nintended to visit Washington, D.C. to meet U.S. and Chinese officials to raise\nhis concerns on the growing trade dispute between the two nations.\n\n**The “Belt and Road Initiative” and China’s Economic Goals**\n\nDuring the course of our research, we also observed the Tsinghua IP scan\nports and probe government departments and commercial entities networks in\nMongolia, Kenya, and Brazil. Each of these countries are key investment\ndestinations as part of China’s Belt and Road Initiative.\n\n\n-----\n\n[China s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), is one of President Xi Jinping s most](http://english.gov.cn/archive/publications/2015/03/30/content_281475080249035.htm)\nambitious programs. Envisaged to project China’s transformative geopolitical\ninfluence across the world, the scale and scope of the project is\nunprecedented. Beijing has committed $4 trillion in investment to infrastructure\nand development projects in 65 countries, affecting 70 percent of the world’s\npopulation and 75 percent of the world’s energy reserves. The scheme is\ndesigned to connect major economic centers in Eurasia together over land and\nsea, many of which historically served the ancient Silk Road two thousand\nyears ago.\n\nAccording to [The Diplomat, “the BRI aims to stabilize China’s western](https://thediplomat.com/2018/06/what-does-chinas-belt-and-road-initiative-mean-for-us-grand-strategy/)\nperipheries, rekindle its economy, propel non-Western international economic\ninstitutions, gain influence in other countries, and diversify trade\nsuppliers/routes while circumventing the U.S. pivot to Asia.”\n\nChina’s Belt and Road Initiative. Source: Mercator Institute for China Studies,\n[merics.org](https://www.merics.org/en)\n\nThe BRI also aims to further strengthen China’s geopolitical and economic\ninfluence in Africa, capitalizing on significant infrastructure investments made\nacross the continent. Kenya in particular has commanded increased attention\ndue to its strategic geographical advantage in China’s Maritime Silk Road\nInitiative (MSRI) — the sea-based component of China’s BRI initiative.\n\n\n-----\n\nEarlier this year, [Kenya announced that it would be lobbying for regional](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-03/30/c_137075352.htm)\n[projects under the BRI. China has already funded a 480-kilometer railway](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-06/01/c_137223684.htm)\nbetween the Kenyan port city of Mombasa and its capital, Nairobi; the railway is\n[eventually expected to extend to neighboring countries Uganda, Rwanda, and](http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/opinion/2017-06/01/content_29570088.htm)\nBurundi as well. However, in May 2018, Kenya announced that it would not\nsign a free trade deal with China that had been under discussion with East\nAfrican Community (EAC) states, raising tensions between Beijing and Nairobi.\n\nIn early June 2018, we observed the Tsinghua IP address aggressively\nscanning ports 22, 53, 80, 389, and 443 of various Kenyan internet-hosting\nproviders and telecommunications companies, as well as ranges dedicated to\nthe Kenya Ports Authority, a state corporation responsible for the maintenance\nand operation of all of Kenya’s seaports. Recorded Future also identified\nnetwork reconnaissance activities directed at the United Nations Office in\nNairobi, Kenya’s Strathmore University, and a broader national education\nnetwork.\n\nThis chart below shows a clear spike in network reconnaissance activity\nagainst Kenyan organizations from the Tsinghua IP. This spike occurred merely\ntwo weeks after Kenya announced its intentions not to support the China-EAC\nfree trade agreement.\n\nNetwork recon events conducted by Tsinghua IP targeting Kenyan institutions\noverlayed with key China-Kenya economic developments, March 2018 to June\n2018.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn April of this year, [President Xi added Brazil to the list of countries receiving](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-25/china-expands-brazil-frontier-as-investment-grows-during-crisis)\nChinese investment in infrastructure from the BRI. Funding for a new $520\nmillion port in the northeastern state of Maranhão was announced, building on\nthe extensive 2016 Chinese investment into the education and energy sectors\nin another Brazilian state, Amapá.\n\nOur research uncovered repeated attempts from the Tsinghua IP to connect to\nthe Ministério Público do Estado Do Amapá in Brazil (Public Ministry of the\nState of Amapá) between April 2 and June 11, 2018, just one month after\nBeijing-based China Communications Construction Co. began construction on\nthe Maranhão port.\n\nWe also observed repeated attempts to connect to organizational networks\nsuch as the National Data Center Building in Mongolia and the Mongolian\nUniversity of Science and Technology between April 6 and April 12, 2018.\nMongolia also plays a vital role in China’s BRI plans; the overland component\nof the BRI, known as the Silk Road Economic Belt (SREB), proposes a new\nEurasia land bridge and no less than five new economic corridors, including a\nChina-Mongolia-Russia corridor.\n\nWe assess with medium confidence that the consistent reconnaissance activity\nobserved from the Tsinghua IP probing networks in Kenya, Brazil, and\nMongolia aligns closely with the BRI economic development goals,\ndemonstrating that the threat actor using this IP is engaged in cyberespionage\non behalf of the Chinese state.\n\n\n-----\n\nRecorded Future timeline of Tsinghua IP activity in correlation with Opportunity\nAlaska and key BRI announcements.\n\n**The Impact of Growing U.S. and China Trade Tensions**\n\nOn June 20, 2018, German multinational automotive corporation Daimler AG\nwas the first prominent company to cut its profit outlook due to the escalating\ntrade tensions between the U.S. and China. The next day, on June 21, we\nobserved network reconnaissance activity specifically targeting ports 139, 22,\n443, and 53 on networks resolving to Daimler AG. The probes originated from\nthe same Tsinghua University IP.\n\nTsinghua IP probing Daimler AG networks on ports 139, 22, 443, and 53\nbetween June 20 to 24, 2018.\n\n**Interaction With U.S. Managed Hotel Network Solutions Provider**\n\nA Shodan query on the Tsinghua IP returned an HTTP 302 response serving a\n“snap.safetynetaccess.com” redirection notice. Based in Needham,\nMassachusetts, [Safety NetAccess builds wireless networks for hotels, resorts,](http://safetynetaccess.com/)\nand other public properties; some of its customers include Hilton, Marriott,\nSonesta, and Wyndham hotel chains. According to the Safety NetAccess\nwebsite, SNAP is its “advanced back-end software program” which provides\nSafety NetAccess’s agents “direct access to any and all managed equipment at\nany location.” While the fields within the redirection notice may look obscure,\nthey correspond to portal page parameters for Nomadix Internet Gateways —\nSafety NetAccess’s primary gateway and routing equipment provider.\n\n\n-----\n\nShodan query reveals Tsinghua IP 166.111.8[.]246 “subscribed” to a Safety\nNetAccess portal.\n\nThe HTTP header response (above) showed that the Cox Communications IP\n98.180.88[.]145 was originally requested by the “subscriber” (SIP), the\nTsinghua IP 166.111.8[.]246. Navigating to the Cox Communications IP\nredirects users to a Safety NetAccess guest internet portal at a Holiday Inn\nhotel based in Ocala, Florida.\n\nSafety NetAccess portal login for a Holiday Inn in Ocala, Florida.\n\n\n-----\n\nBreaking down the URL in the Location field in the HTTP response gives us\nthe MAC address of the Tsinghua device (00:13:5F:07:87:D9), and the IP\naddress of the Nomadix device (68.105.161[.]74), shown as UIP in the URL.\nThe UIP resolves to Cox Communications in Ocala, Florida, and open-source\nresearch indicates that the device hosting this UIP is an AG 3100 Nomadix\nrack-mounted internet gateway, supporting DNS and HTTP redirection using a\n[magic IP. This UIP also appears to be running a vulnerable WindWeb server on](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/attacksignatures/detail.jsp?asid=24707)\nport 443. Shodan results show failed FTP login attempts to the internet\ngateway, as well as Telnet events.\n\nFrom the limited data available to us, we assess with low confidence that the\nTsinghua IP was attempting to leverage the remote administrative access\ncontrols enabled by Safety NetAccess’s SNAP portal for the Holiday Inn hotel\nin Florida.\n\n**Is the “ext4” Backdoor Associated With the Tsinghua IP?**\n\nThe discovery of the “ext4” backdoor on a Tibetan device enabled us to identify\nthe wider targeting of the device from the Tsinghua University IP. However,\nnone of the attempted connections to the Tibetan device from the Tsinghua IP\nresulted in the successful activation of the backdoor, leaving it unclear whether\nthe threat actors behind the widespread network recon activities were also\nresponsible for the “ext4” backdoor.\n\nThat leaves us with two possible scenarios explaining the involvement of the\n“ext4” backdoor on a Tibetan network with the Tsinghua IP:\n\nThe Tsinghua IP is being used by a threat actor to access the “ext4”\nbackdoor, but a technical fault or operator error is resulting in the\nmisconfiguration of the TCP connection packets required to establish\ncommunication with the backdoor.\nThe Tsinghua IP is being used extensively to conduct network\nreconnaissance and cyberespionage against strategic economic and\nnational interests, not only targeting countries that China is engaging with\nunder BRI, but also targeting “Five Poisons ” organizations, such as the2\nTibetan network. The “ext4” backdoor is therefore likely to belong to\nanother threat actor not engaged in the network scanning activity against\norganizations outlined earlier in this report.\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\n**The “ext4” Backdoor**\n\n\n-----\n\n“ext4” backdoor key characteristics.\n\n“ext4” is a novel Linux backdoor that was present on the victim network during\nthe same time that the Tsinghua IP reconnaissance activity was observed (May\nto June, 2018). In total, 23 attempts to connect to the victim device over TCP\n443 were made from the Tsinghua IP during this period.\n\n[The “ext4” backdoor was identified running within a legitimate system “cron” file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron)\non a compromised CentOS web server affiliated with the Tibetan community.\nAn analysis of modified system files revealed that the “0anacron” “cron” file had\nbeen modified to execute a non-standard binary called “ext4” located in the\n/usr/bin/ext4 directory on the compromised server. The binary was configured\nto run hourly, and, interestingly, as a background process. This would suppress\nany output from appearing on the Linux terminal’s standard output, thus making\nit less detectable to the administrator of the web server.\n\nModified etc/cron.hourly/0anacron script to include “ext4” backdoor function.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe ext4 binary was relatively small at only 9511 bytes and was made up of\nsimple functions. It was dynamically linked to the libpcap library, which is\n[present on Unix systems to allow the capturing of packets (pcap files) typically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pcap)\nused by “network sniffers.”\n\nThere were three primary functions that drive the operation of the backdoor:\n“main,” “process,” and “my_pcap_handler.” All of these functions flow together\nto perform the main functionality of the backdoor.\n\n**Main Function**\n\nThe main function performed three central tasks: to remove the file\n“tmp/0baaf161db39,” to create a child process that executes the backdoor\nfunctionality, and to set a sleep timer of 180 seconds. The process is\nterminated when the sleep timer limit is reached.\n\nAdditionally, the main function also checked the command line arguments to\ndetermine which network interface to monitor on the compromised network. By\ndefault, “ext4” used “eth0.”\n\n**Process Function**\n\nThe main purpose of the process function was to create a handle to capture\nnetwork traffic, which was done by use of the libpcap function,\n“pcap_open_live.”\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce the handle had been created, another libpcap function, “pcap_loop,” was\nexecuted, which processed all of the packets sent to the interface specified in\n“pcap_open_live” and sent them to the function “my_packet_handler” to parse\nand perform actions based on the type of packet sent.\n\n**“my_packet_handler” Function**\n\nAll packets sent to a specified network interface were received by the\n“my_packet_handler” function. The handler then parsed the Ethernet, IP, and\nTCP headers to perform a series of checks to validate if it is a packet that it is3\nmeant to process. Once validated, the function decoded the payload, which\nwould typically be a command fed to a bash shell on the compromised CentOS\nhost.\n\nThe below steps demonstrate the parsing and validation criteria the function\nused to ensure that it processed the correct packets. If at any point the function\nreceives unexpected results, the packet is dropped from the function and the\nnext one is processed.\n\nCheck the ethernet header to ensure the type is IP (Type 2048).\nIP header length is parsed from the IP header.\nParse the IP header to ensure the protocol is TCP (Type 6).\nParse the TCP header to ensure the destination port is 443.\nFind the data offset or the start of the payload.\nCheck that the TCP flags equal 322, which equates to the following flags\nbeing set: NS (Nonce Sum), ECE (ECN-Echo), and SYN.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe breakdown of the flags is important, as it looks for the SYN and ECE to be\nset, as well as the NS flag. The NS flag is used to protect against accidental or\nmalicious concealment of marked packets from the TCP sender.\n\nThe ECE flag is responsible for indicating if the TCP peer is Explicit Congestion\n[Notification (ECN) compatible. ECN is an optional extension to TCP that](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explicit_Congestion_Notification)\nprevents packets being dropped due to congestion. While the use of ECN can\nbe normal in larger enterprises with ECN-capable routers, the use of the NS bit\nseems to be experimental and is not officially used in any TCP\nimplementations.\n\nIf a packet passes all of the criteria, the function gets the length of the payload\nand checks that it is between five and 1024 bytes. After that, it allocates\nmemory and then saves the payload into memory.\n\nThe payload is XOR-encoded, and the first byte of the payload is the XOR key.\nThe function will use the first byte of payload to decode the next five bytes and\ncheck to see if they equal the string “anti:.”\n\n\n-----\n\nIf the decoded bytes equal “anti:,” then the rest of payload will be decoded and\npassed as a final argument to run a bash command using the execl call.\n\n## Outlook\n\nChina continues to use cyber operations to monitor and track threats to\ndomestic stability, neatly summarized as the “Five Poisons.” This focus on\ndomestic threats enables security researchers to identify new campaigns and\ntools being aggressively used against persecuted communities. “ext4” is a\nsophisticated lightweight Linux backdoor designed to enable the threat actor to\naccess the compromised device and conduct further malicious activity. It is also\nan example of a tool probably being used by Chinese nation-state actors to\ntarget the Tibetan community.\n\nFurther, the widespread use of CentOS servers, many of which are unpatched\nand used in production systems, highlights the breadth of the potential attack\nsurface.\n\n\n-----\n\nChina s Belt and Road Initiative and its long-term investment in African\n[infrastructure has enabled China to wield massive influence in those countries](https://www.ft.com/content/0f534aa4-4549-11e7-8519-9f94ee97d996)\ntargeted by these policies. We assess with medium confidence that the\nwidespread network reconnaissance activities emanating from Tsinghua\nUniversity infrastructure and targeting economic interests in Kenya, Mongolia,\nand Brazil are state directed.\n\nChina has repeatedly conducted cyberespionage in support of its national\neconomic interests. In November 2017, the DOJ indicted three Chinese\nhackers found guilty of economic cyberespionage. Further, in its recent report\non Foreign Economic Espionage in Cyberspace, the U.S. National\nCounterintelligence and Security Center highlighted Chinese threat actors\nAPT10, KeyBoy, and Temp.Periscope as having conducted extensive\ncyberespionage in support of strategic national and economic benefit.\n\nOther than the discovery of the “ext4” backdoor targeting the Tibetan\ncommunity, we have not identified the presence of malware in any of the\ndocumented organizations in this report, as the bulk of our analysis was based\non third-party metadata. However, we assess with medium confidence that the\ntargeted scanning and probing of networks during the timeframe of bilateral\ntrade and strategic dialogue between China and its Alaskan, Kenyan, Brazilian,\nand Mongolian counterparts indicates the activity is being conducted by a\nthreat actor (or multiple threat actors with access to the same Tsinghua\nendpoint) directed by the Chinese state.\n\n**Network Defense Recommendations**\n\nRecorded Future recommends organizations conduct the following measures\nwhen defending against hostile network reconnaissance and the potential\ndeployment of a CentOS backdoor from the Chinese threat actor detailed in\nthis report:\n\nConfigure your intrusion detection systems (IDS) and intrusion prevention\nsystems (IPS) to alert and block connection attempts from Tsinghua\nUniversity IP 166.111.8[.]246.\nUsing the provided Yara rule for the “ext4” backdoor, conduct scans of\nany Linux hosts on networks for presence of the backdoor.\nIf applicable, ensure the “ext4” Yara rule is deployed to the endpoint\nprotection appliance used in your organization.\nScan Linux hosts for the\npresence of the “/usr/bin/ext4” and “/tmp/0baaf161db39” files.\n\nAdditionally, we advise organizations to follow the following general information\nsecurity best practice guidelines:\n\n\n-----\n\nKeep all software and applications up to date; in particular, operating\nsystems, antivirus software, and core system utilities.\nFilter email correspondence and scrutinize attachments for malware.\nMake regular backups of your system and store the backups offline,\npreferably off-site so that data cannot be accessed via the network.\nHave a well-thought-out incident response and communications plan.\nAdhere to strict compartmentalization of company-sensitive data. In\nparticular, look at which data anyone with access to an employee account\nor device would have access to (for example, through device or account\ntakeover through phishing). Strongly consider instituting role-based\naccess, limiting company-wide data access, and restricting access to\nsensitive data.\nEmploy host-based controls — one of the best defenses and warning\nsignals to thwart attacks is to conduct client-based host logging and\nintrusion detection capabilities.\nImplement basic incident response and detection deployments and\ncontrols like network IDS, netflow collection, host logging, and web proxy,\nalongside human monitoring of detection sources.\nBe aware of partner or supply chain security standards. Being able to\nmonitor and enforce security standards for ecosystem partners is an\nimportant part of any organization’s security posture.\n\n[See the appendix in the PDF version of this analysis to view a full list of the](https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2018-0816.pdf)\nassociated indicators of compromise.\n\n\n-----",
