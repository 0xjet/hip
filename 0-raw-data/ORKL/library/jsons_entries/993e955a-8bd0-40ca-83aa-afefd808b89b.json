While security updates are automatically applied in most computers, some users and\n[enterprises may delay deployment of patches. Unfortunately, the ransomware, known as WannaCrypt, appears](https://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/threat/encyclopedia/Entry.aspx?Name=Ransom:Win32/WannaCrypt)\nto have affected computers that have not applied the patch for these vulnerabilities. While the attack is unfolding,\n[we remind users to install MS17-010 if they have not already done so.](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/ms17-010.aspx)\n\n_The trend towards increasingly sophisticated malware behavior, highlighted by the use of exploits and other_\n_attack vectors, makes older platforms so much more susceptible to ransomware attacks. From June to_\n_November 2017, Windows 7 devices were 3.4 times more likely to encounter ransomware compared to_\n_Windows 10 devices._\n_Read our latest report: A worthy upgrade: Next-gen security on Windows 10 proves resilient against_\n**_ransomware outbreaks in 2017_**\n\nMicrosoft antimalware telemetry immediately picked up signs of this campaign. Our expert systems gave us\nvisibility and context into this new attack as it happened, allowing Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection\n(ATP) to deliver real-time defense. Through automated analysis, machine learning, and predictive modeling, we\nwere able to rapidly protect against this malware.\n\nIn this blog, we provide an early analysis of the end-to-end ransomware attack. Please note this threat is still\nunder investigation. The attack is still active, and there is a possibility that the attacker will attempt to react to our\ndetection response.\n\nTo test how Windows Defender ATP can help your organization detect, investigate, and respond to advanced\nattacks, **[sign up for a free trial.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windowsforbusiness/windows-atp?ocid=cx-blog-mmpc)**\n\n## Attack vector\n\nRansomware threats do not typically spread rapidly. Threats like WannaCrypt (also known as WannaCry,\nWanaCrypt0r, WCrypt, or WCRY) usually leverage social engineering or email as primary attack vector, relying\non users downloading and executing a malicious payload. However, in this unique case, the ransomware\n[perpetrators used publicly available exploit code for the patched SMB “EternalBlue” vulnerability,](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/mmpc/2017/06/16/analysis-of-the-shadow-brokers-release-and-mitigation-with-windows-10-virtualization-based-security/) CVE-20170145, which can be triggered by sending a specially crafted packet to a targeted SMBv1 server. This vulnerability\n[was fixed in security bulletin MS17-010, which was released on March 14, 2017.](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/ms17-010.aspx)\n\n[WannaCrypt’s spreading mechanism is borrowed from well-known](https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/142464/MS17-010-SMBv1-SrvOs2FeaToNt-OOB-Remote-Code-Execution.html) [public SMB exploits, which armed this regular](https://github.com/RiskSense-Ops/MS17-010)\nransomware with worm-like functionalities, creating an entry vector for machines still unpatched even after the fix\nhad become available.\n\nThe exploit code used by WannaCrypt was designed to work only against unpatched Windows 7 and Windows\n[Server 2008 (or earlier OS) systems, so Windows 10 PCs are not affected by this attack.](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/mmpc/2017/06/08/windows-10-creators-update-hardens-security-with-next-gen-defense/)\n\nWe haven’t found evidence of the exact initial entry vector used by this threat, but there are two scenarios that\nwe believe are highly possible explanations for the spread of this ransomware:\n\nArrival through social engineering emails designed to trick users to run the malware and activate the wormspreading functionality with the SMB exploit\nInfection through SMB exploit when an unpatched computer is addressable from other infected machines\n\n\n-----\n\n## Dropper\n\nThe threat arrives as a dropper Trojan that has the following two components:\n\n1. A component that attempts to exploit the SMB CVE-2017-0145 vulnerability in other computers\n2. The ransomware known as WannaCrypt\n\nThe dropper tries to connect the following domains using the API InternetOpenUrlA():\n\nwww[.]iuqerfsodp9ifjaposdfjhgosurijfaewrwergwea[.]com\nwww[.]ifferfsodp9ifjaposdfjhgosurijfaewrwergwea[.]com\nwww[x].iuqerfsodp9ifjaposdfjhgosurijfaewrwergwea[.]test\n\nIf connection to the domains is successful, the dropper does not infect the system further with ransomware or try\nto exploit other systems to spread; it simply stops execution. However, if the connection fails, the threat proceeds\nto drop the ransomware and creates a service on the system.\n\nIn other words, unlike in most malware infections, IT Administrators should NOT block these domains. Note\nthat the malware is not proxy-aware, so a local DNS record may be required. This does not need to point to the\nInternet, but can resolve to any accessible server which will accept connections on TCP 80.\n\nThe threat creates a service named mssecsvc2.0, whose function is to exploit the SMB vulnerability in other\ncomputers accessible from the infected system:\n\n_Service Name: mssecsvc2.0_\n\n_Service Description: (Microsoft Security Center (2.0) Service)_\n\n_Service Parameters: “-m security”_\n\n\n-----\n\n## WannaCrypt ransomware\n\nThe ransomware component is a dropper that contains a password-protected .zip archive in its resource section.\nThe document encryption routine and the files in the .zip archive contain support tools, a decryption tool, and the\nransom message. In the samples we analyzed, the password for the .zip archive is “WNcry@2ol7”.\n\nWhen run, WannaCrypt creates the following registry keys:\n\n_HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\\\<random string> = “<malware working_\n_directory>\\tasksche.exe”_\n_HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\WanaCrypt0r\\\\wd = “<malware working directory>”_\n\nIt changes the wallpaper to a ransom message by modifying the following registry key:\n\n_HKCU\\Control Panel\\Desktop\\Wallpaper: “<malware working directory>\\@WanaDecryptor@.bmp”_\n\nIt creates the following files in the malware’s working directory:\n\n_00000000.eky_\n_00000000.pky_\n_00000000.res_\n_274901494632976.bat_\n_@Please_Read_Me@.txt_\n_@WanaDecryptor@.bmp_\n_@WanaDecryptor@.exe_\n_b.wnry_\n_c.wnry_\n_f.wnry_\n_m.vbs_\n_msg\\m bulgarian.wnry_\n\n\n-----\n\n_msg\\m_chinese (simplified).wnry_\n_msg\\m_chinese (traditional).wnry_\n_msg\\m_croatian.wnry_\n_msg\\m_czech.wnry_\n_msg\\m_danish.wnry_\n_msg\\m_dutch.wnry_\n_msg\\m_english.wnry_\n_msg\\m_filipino.wnry_\n_msg\\m_finnish.wnry_\n_msg\\m_french.wnry_\n_msg\\m_german.wnry_\n_msg\\m_greek.wnry_\n_msg\\m_indonesian.wnry_\n_msg\\m_italian.wnry_\n_msg\\m_japanese.wnry_\n_msg\\m_korean.wnry_\n_msg\\m_latvian.wnry_\n_msg\\m_norwegian.wnry_\n_msg\\m_polish.wnry_\n_msg\\m_portuguese.wnry_\n_msg\\m_romanian.wnry_\n_msg\\m_russian.wnry_\n_msg\\m_slovak.wnry_\n_msg\\m_spanish.wnry_\n_msg\\m_swedish.wnry_\n_msg\\m_turkish.wnry_\n_msg\\m_vietnamese.wnry_\n_r.wnry_\n_s.wnry_\n_t.wnry_\n_TaskData\\Tor\\libeay32.dll_\n_TaskData\\Tor\\libevent-2-0-5.dll_\n_TaskData\\Tor\\libevent_core-2-0-5.dll_\n_TaskData\\Tor\\libevent_extra-2-0-5.dll_\n_TaskData\\Tor\\libgcc_s_sjlj-1.dll_\n_TaskData\\Tor\\libssp-0.dll_\n_TaskData\\Tor\\ssleay32.dll_\n_TaskData\\Tor\\taskhsvc.exe_\n_TaskData\\Tor\\tor.exe_\n_TaskData\\Tor\\zlib1.dll_\n_taskdl.exe_\n_taskse.exe_\n_u.wnry_\n\nWannaCrypt may also create the following files:\n\n_%SystemRoot%\\tasksche.exe_\n_%SystemDrive%\\intel\\<random directory name>\\tasksche.exe_\n_%ProgramData%\\<random directory name>\\tasksche.exe_\n\nIt may create a randomly named service that has the following associated ImagePath: “cmd.exe /c “<malware\n_working directory>\\tasksche.exe””._\n\n\n-----\n\nIt then searches the whole computer for any file with any of the following file name extensions: .123, .jpeg, .rb,\n_.602, .jpg, .rtf, .doc, .js, .sch, .3dm, .jsp, .sh, .3ds, .key, .sldm, .3g2, .lay, .sldm, .3gp, .lay6, .sldx, .7z,_\n_.ldf, .slk, .accdb, .m3u, .sln, .aes, .m4u, .snt, .ai, .max, .sql, .ARC, .mdb, .sqlite3, .asc, .mdf, .sqlitedb,_\n_.asf, .mid, .stc, .asm, .mkv, .std, .asp, .mml, .sti, .avi, .mov, .stw, .backup, .mp3, .suo, .bak, .mp4, .svg,_\n_.bat, .mpeg, .swf, .bmp, .mpg, .sxc, .brd, .msg, .sxd, .bz2, .myd, .sxi, .c, .myi, .sxm, .cgm, .nef, .sxw,_\n_.class, .odb, .tar, .cmd, .odg, .tbk, .cpp, .odp, .tgz, .crt, .ods, .tif, .cs, .odt, .tiff, .csr, .onetoc2, .txt, .csv,_\n_.ost, .uop, .db, .otg, .uot, .dbf, .otp, .vb, .dch, .ots, .vbs, .der”, .ott, .vcd, .dif, .p12, .vdi, .dip, .PAQ,_\n_.vmdk, .djvu, .pas, .vmx, .docb, .pdf, .vob, .docm, .pem, .vsd, .docx, .pfx, .vsdx, .dot, .php, .wav, .dotm,_\n_.pl, .wb2, .dotx, .png, .wk1, .dwg, .pot, .wks, .edb, .potm, .wma, .eml, .potx, .wmv, .fla, .ppam, .xlc, .flv,_\n_.pps, .xlm, .frm, .ppsm, .xls, .gif, .ppsx, .xlsb, .gpg, .ppt, .xlsm, .gz, .pptm, .xlsx, .h, .pptx, .xlt, .hwp,_\n_.ps1, .xltm, .ibd, .psd, .xltx, .iso, .pst, .xlw, .jar, .rar, .zip, .java, .raw._\n\nWannaCrypt encrypts all files it finds and renames them by appending .WNCRY to the file name. For example, if\na file is named picture.jpg, the ransomware encrypts and renames the file to picture.jpg.WNCRY.\n\nThis ransomware also creates the file @Please_Read_Me@.txt in every folder where files are encrypted. The file\ncontains the same ransom message shown in the replaced wallpaper image (see screenshot below).\n\nAfter completing the encryption process, the malware deletes the volume shadow copies by running the following\ncommand:\n\n_cmd.exe /c vssadmin delete shadows /all /quiet & wmic shadowcopy delete & bcdedit /set {default}_\n_bootstatuspolicy ignoreallfailures & bcdedit /set {default} recoveryenabled no & wbadmin delete catalog -quiet_\n\nIt then replaces the desktop background image with the following message:\n\n\n-----\n\nIt also runs an executable showing a ransom note which indicates a $300 ransom in Bitcoins as well as a timer:\n\nThe text is localized into the following languages: Bulgarian, Chinese (simplified), Chinese (traditional), Croatian,\nCzech, Danish, Dutch, English, Filipino, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean,\nLatvian, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Slovak, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish, and\nVietnamese.\n\nThe ransomware also demonstrates the decryption capability by allowing the user to decrypt a few random files,\nfree of charge. It then quickly reminds the user to pay the ransom to decrypt all the remaining files.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Spreading capability\n\nThe worm functionality attempts to infect unpatched Windows machines in the local network. At the same time, it\nalso executes massive scanning on Internet IP addresses to find and infect other vulnerable computers. This\nactivity results in large SMB traffic from the infected host, which can be observed by SecOps personnel, as\nshown below.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Internet scanning routine randomly generates octets to form the IPv4 address. The malware then targets that\nIP to attempt to exploit CVE-2017-0145. The threat avoids infecting the IPv4 address if the randomly generated\nvalue for first octet is 127 or if the value is equal to or greater than 224, in order to skip local loopback interfaces.\nOnce a vulnerable machine is found and infected, it becomes the next hop to infect other machines. The vicious\ninfection cycle continues as the scanning routing discovers unpatched computers.\n\nWhen it successfully infects a vulnerable computer, the malware runs kernel-level shellcode that seems to have\nbeen copied from the public backdoor known as DOUBLEPULSAR, but with certain adjustments to drop and\nexecute the ransomware dropper payload, both for x86 and x64 systems.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Protection against the WannaCrypt attack\n\n[To get the latest protection from Microsoft, upgrade to Windows 10.
