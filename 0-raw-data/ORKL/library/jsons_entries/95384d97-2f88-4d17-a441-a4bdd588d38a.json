The malware intercepts the log-in POST\nrequest, encrypts the requested data and sends it to a command-and-control (C&C) server.\n\nWhen it targets users of online banking applications that are protected by transaction\nauthentication devices such as tokens or banking card readers, W32.Silon waits until the\nuser has logged in and then injects dynamic HTML code into the log-in flow between the\nuser and the bank’s Web server.\n\nFirst, the malware presents authentic-looking Web pages that appear to be from the bank\nasking users to employ their transaction authentication device. Next, the user is asked to\nenter information from the device into the Web page\n\n\n-----\n\nThis information is then used by the criminals to execute fraudulent transactions on behalf of\nthe user, Trusteer said.\n\n“We have put all of our banking customers on alert, and are attempting to get the word out\nwith this advisory,” Klein said.\n\nThe sophistication of online scams has evolved to a point where watchdogs organizations\n[such as the Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG) have created an entirely new category for](http://www.internetnews.com/security/article.php/3840921)\ndefining and quantifying attacks on financial institutions.\n\nThe group now defines “crimeware” as code designed to attack the data held by financial\ninstitutions.\n\n“Due to evolution of attack sophistication, it is becoming increasingly difficult to separate and\nreport on attacks that are specifically designed to steal customer banking information,” Dan\nHubbard, Websense’s CTO, said earlier this month. “Additionally, attacks that only [look] for\ncredentials from popular social networking, Webmail and gaming sites can lead to attacks for\nbanking theft and crimeware.”\n\nTrusteer advises online banking customers to be especially vigilant when conducting\n[transactions online and to visit its Web site for help detecting and removing the W32.Silon](http://www.trusteer.com/)\nTrojan.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Larry Barrett](https://www.internetnews.com/author/larry-barrett/)\n[Previous articleCalifornia Medicaid Members’ Data Exposed](https://www.internetnews.com/security/california-medicaid-members-data-exposed/)\n[Next articleGoogle Chrome development slows to fix bugs](https://www.internetnews.com/blog/google-chrome-development-slows-to-fix-bugs/)\n\n\n-----",
