Earth Karkaddan is known for using\nsocial engineering and email as an entry point, which then leads to the deployment of the Crimson remote\naccess trojan (RAT) malware.\n\nAside from using the Crimson RAT malware, Earth Karkaddan also recently expanded its Windows malware\narsenal to include other RATs such as ObliqueRat[i] and NetWire malware. In the past, the APT group has\noccasionally used custom Android application package (APK) backdoors.\n\n#### Aliases\nOperation C-Major,[ii] APT36, PROJECTM,[iii] Mythic Leopard,[iv] and Transparent Tribe.[v]\n\n#### Earth Karkaddan Activity Summary\n\n_Earth Karkaddan Noteworthy Events Timeline_\n\nDate Event\n\n2016 Earth Karkaddan APT conducted an information theft campaign\ntargeting Indian military and government entities via spear\n\nphishing attacks.\n\n2018 The group targeted Pakistani activists and civil society networks\nusing a phishing campaign to deploy the Crimson RAT malware and\nan Android spyware called StealthAgent.[vi]\n\n|Date|Event|\n|---|---|\n|2016|Earth Karkaddan APT conducted an information theft campaign targeting Indian military and government entities via spear phishing attacks.|\n|2018|The group targeted Pakistani activists and civil society networks using a phishing campaign to deploy the Crimson RAT malware and an Android spyware called StealthAgent.vi|\n|2020|Earth Karkaddan targeted an Indian defense organization using fake profiles of attractive women as social engineering lures.vii|\n|2021|Earth Karkaddan used Covid-19 vaccine lures to target the Indian medical industry.viii|\n\n\n-----\n\n## Malware Analysis\n\nFigure 1. Various infection chains of Earth Karkaddan campaigns\n\n_Earth Karkaddan Infection Chain_\nThe following infection chains are typical of Earth Karkaddan campaigns, but these may vary slightly over\ntime.\n\n**Chain** **Description**\n\n1 The most common arrival method for Earth Karkaddan is via a spear phishing\nemail that contains an attached document.\n\nThe document contains a malicious macro, which, when enabled, will drop\nand execute a RAT malware, most commonly Crimson RAT.\n\nThe RAT malware will then communicate with its command-and-control (C&C)\nserver and can either download more malware or perform backdoor\ncommands such as exfiltrating data.\n\n2 The Crimson RAT malware can also arrive via a USB worm.\n\n3 Earth Karkaddan can also infect victims using a custom-made Android RAT\nthat can arrive via a phishing link.\n\nFrom a global view of Earth Karkaddan activity as seen from Trend MicroÔ Smart ProtectionÔ Network\n(SPN) data gathered from January 2020 to September 2021, we saw that India is the main target of one of\nthe APT’s most recent campaigns.\n\n|Chain|Description|\n|---|---|\n|1|The most common arrival method for Earth Karkaddan is via a spear phishing email that contains an attached document. The document contains a malicious macro, which, when enabled, will drop and execute a RAT malware, most commonly Crimson RAT. The RAT malware will then communicate with its command-and-control (C&C) server and can either download more malware or perform backdoor commands such as exfiltrating data.|\n|2|The Crimson RAT malware can also arrive via a USB worm.|\n|3|Earth Karkaddan can also infect victims using a custom-made Android RAT that can arrive via a phishing link.|\n\n\n-----\n\n_Earth Karkaddan Arrival Method_\n\nEarth Karkaddan’s most common arrival method is via malicious spam, which is a typical entry vector used\nby other APT groups. The group can use a wide variety of lures, ranging from a fake government-related\ndocument, to honeytraps with fake profiles of attractive women and coronavirus-related malspam.\n\nBelow is an example of an Earth Karkaddan phishing email with a malicious document attachment.\n\nFigure 2. Example of a spear phishing email from Earth Karkaddan\n\nThe attached file is a Microsoft Office document that contains a malicious macro featuring fake Covid-19\ninformation to lure victims into executing the macro:\n\nFigure 3. The malicious attachment uses coronavirus-related information as a lure\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce the victim executes the macro, it will decrypt an embedded dropper executable that is hidden inside a\ntext box. The executable will be saved to a hardcoded path and will be executed in the victim’s machine.\n\nFigure 4. Macro from Earth Karkaddan APT that decrypts hidden text inside text boxes and executes the\n\ndecrypted file on a victim machine\n\n\n-----\n\nBelow is the encrypted executable hidden behind one of the text boxes in UserForm1:\n\nFigure 5. Encrypted Crimson RAT executables hidden inside text boxes\n\nOnce the executable file is executed, it will proceed to unzip a file named mdkhm.zip and will execute the\nCrimson RAT executable named dlrarhsiva.exe.\n\nFigure 6. The dlrarhsiva.exe Crimson RAT executable\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Crimson RAT Malware Analysis\nBased on our observation, Crimson RAT is the most common malware used in Earth Karkaddan campaigns,\nwith the main purpose of obtaining and exfiltrating information from targeted Windows systems and\nuploading them to the attacker's C&C server.\n\nThe Earth Karkaddan APT group usually delivers this malware using a spear-phishing email with a malicious\ndocument attachment to deceive a user into executing the said file manually and enabling its macros.\n\nUpon execution, the Crimson RAT creates persistence using the following registry:\n\n  - Registry: HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\n\n  - Key: dlrarhsiva (This key is usually a random name)\n\nFigure 7. Crimson RAT persistence mechanism\n\nLike many other older RATs, Crimson RAT has also been cracked by threat actors and has been shared or\ndistributed underground. Thus, it’s important to note that a Crimson RAT infection may not always mean\nthat it is from an Earth Karkaddan campaign.\n\nBased on our analysis, the Crimson RAT modules can steal credentials from web browsers on a victim\nmachine:\n\nFigure 8. Crimson RAT steals web browser credentials\n\nThe malware contains minimal amounts of obfuscation and is compiled as a .NET binary. The simplicity and\nlack of anti-analysis techniques on the final structure of the file could mean that it possibly did not come\nfrom a well-funded organization. Below is a screenshot of the decompiled backdoor commands where it\ncan be seen that the original function names and variables are retained and minimally obfuscated.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 9. Sample list of commands found in the Crimson RAT malware\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Crimson RAT and other malware (including Android RATs) used in Earth Karkaddan campaigns also\nusually contain a command to list processes.\n\nFigure 10. Crimson RAT command to list running processes on a victim machine\n\nCrimson RAT has another backdoor command that lists running processes called “getavs.” Based on the\nname of the command, it is possible that its purpose is to identify processes related to antivirus software.\n\nFigure 11. The “getavs” backdoor command\n\nCrimson RAT modules can also capture screenshots and keystrokes, while some variants can even collect\nfiles from removable drives (such as USB drives).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 13. Crimson RAT collects files from removable drives\n\nFigure 14. Crimson RAT collects keystrokes\n\nBelow is an example of a network communication between the infected host and the Crimson RAT C&C\nserver. In this case, the Crimson RAT malware is trying to connect to the C&C server to send information\nabout the infected host, such as PC name, operating system (OS) information, and location of the malware\ninside the system.\n\nFigure 15. Network traffic from the Crimson RAT malware\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 16. Crimson RAT can collect OS information\n\nThe following are a list of commands that we have found after analyzing the Crimson RAT malware:\n\nCommand Description\n\n|afile|Sends file to C&C|\n|---|---|\n|cnls|Stops upload, download, and screen capture commands|\n|cscreen|Saves JPEG image in standard screen size|\n|delt|Deletes file|\n|dirs|Lists drives|\n|dowf|Gets file from C&C|\n|dowr|Downloads file from C&C then save/execute it|\n|endpo|Terminates a process using Process IDs (PIDs)|\n|file|Sends file to C&C|\n|filsz|Get file information: CreationTimeUTC and Filesize|\n|fldr|Lists folders in a directory|\n|fles|Lists files in a directory|\n|get-avs|Gets list of processes running|\n|info|Sends PC information|\n|listf|Searches for files given a list of extensions|\n|procl|Gets a process list|\n|putsrt|Creates start up persistence using Run Registry|\n|runf|Runs a file/command|\n\n\n-----\n\n|scren|Captures screenshot|\n|---|---|\n|scrsz|Gets screen size|\n|stops|Stops capturing screenshots|\n|thumb|Gets the 200x150 GIF thumbnail of a given image|\n|udlt|Downloads \"remvUser\" file from C&C then executes it|\n\n\n-----\n\n#### ObliqueRat Malware Analysis\n\nAside from the Crimson RAT malware, the Earth Karkaddan APT group is also known to use the ObliqueRat\nmalware[ix] in its campaigns.\n\nThis malware is also commonly distributed in spear-phishing campaigns using social engineering tactics to\nlure victims into downloading another malicious document. In one of its most recent campaigns, the lure\nused was that of the Centre for Land Warfare Studies (CLAWS) in New Delhi, India.\n\nFigure 17. Initial spear-phishing document with a link to another malicious document\n\nOnce the victim clicks the link, it will download a document laced with a malicious macro. Upon enabling\nthe macro, it will then download the ObliqueRat malware that is hidden inside an image file.\n\nFigure 18. The downloaded \"1More-details.doc\" contains malicious macros that will download and execute\n\nthe ObliqueRat malware in a victim’s machine\n\nThe macros inside the file will then download a bitmap image (BMP) file where the ObliqueRAT malware is\nhidden, decode the downloaded BMP file, then create a persistence mechanism by creating a Startup URL\nthat will automatically run the ObliqueRAT malware.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 19. Malicious macro codes will download, decode, and execute the ObliqueRat malware\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 20 shows a summary of the ObliqueRat malware’s infection chain:\n\nFigure 20. ObliqueRat attack chain\n\nBelow is a list of backdoor commands that this particular ObliqueRAT malware variant can perform:\n\n**Command (v5.2)** **Info**\n\n**0** System information\n\n**1** List drive and drive type\n\n**3** Find certain files and file sizes\n\n**4** Send back zip files (specified filename)\n\n**4A/4E** Send back zip files\n\n**5** Find certain files and file sizes\n\n**6** Zip certain folder, send back to C&C, then delete\nit\n\n**7** Execute commands\n\n**8** Receive file from C&C\n\n**BACKED** Back up the file lgb\n\n**RNM** Rename file\n\n**TSK** List running processes\n\n|Command (v5.2) Info|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|0|System information|\n|1|List drive and drive type|\n|3|Find certain files and file sizes|\n|4|Send back zip files (specified filename)|\n|4A/4E|Send back zip files|\n|5|Find certain files and file sizes|\n|6|Zip certain folder, send back to C&C, then delete it|\n|7|Execute commands|\n|8|Receive file from C&C|\n|BACKED|Back up the file lgb|\n|RNM|Rename file|\n\n\n-----\n\n|EXIT|Stop execution|\n|---|---|\n|RESTART|Restart connection to C&C|\n|KILL|Kill certain processes|\n|AUTO|Find certain files|\n|RHT|Delete files|\n\n\nNote that in this specific campaign, both the Crimson RAT malware downloader document and the\nObliqueRat malware downloader share the same download domain, which is sharingmymedia[.]com. This\nindicates that both malware types were actively used in Earth Karkaddan APT campaigns.\n\nFigure 21. Crimson RAT and ObliqueRat spear-phishing email attachments that feature the same download\n\ndomain\n\n#### CapraRAT Malware Analysis\n\nAside from deploying Windows RATs, Earth Karkaddan is also known for using Android RATs to spy on their\ntargets.\n\nThis was particularly noted in a 2018 campaign wherein Earth Karkaddan targeted Pakistani activists and\ncivil society networks using an android spyware known as StealthAgent,[x] which is detected by Trend Micro\nas AndroidOS_SMongo.HRX. A modified version of the open source AhMyth Android RAT was also used in\na 2020 Earth Karkaddan campaign that targeted Indian military and government personnel using fake porn\nand Covid-19 tracking apps as lures.[xi]\n\nWe observed this group using another Android RAT — TrendMicro has named this “CapraRAT “ —,” which\nis possibly a modified version of an open-source RAT called AndroRAT. While analyzing this Android RAT,\nwe saw several similar capabilities to the CrimsonRat malware that the group usually used to infect\nWindows systems.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe have been observing CapraRAT samples since 2017, and one of the first samples we analyzed (SHA256: d9979a41027fe790399edebe5ef8765f61e1eb1a4ee1d11690b4c2a0aa38ae42, detected by Trend\nMicro as as AndroidOS_Androrat.HRXD) revealed some interesting things in that year: they used\n\"com.example.appcode.appcode\" as the APK package name and used a possible public certificate\n“74bd7b456d9e651fc84446f65041bef1207c408d,” which possibly meant the sample was used for testing,\nand they were just starting to use it in their campaigns during that year.\n\nThe C&C domain android[.]viral91[.]xyz, to which the malware was connecting, also shows that the APT\nteam likely uses subdomains to host or connect to Android malware. In previous years, some CrimsonRAT\nsamples were also found to be hosted on the viral91[.]xyz domain.\n\nFigure 22. CrimsonRAT malware hosted in viral91[.]xyz\n\nWe were also able to source a phishing document, “csd_car_price_list_2017,” that is related to this domain\nand has been seen in the wild in 2017. This file name is interesting, as “csd” is likely to be associated to\n\"Canteen Stores Department\" in Pakistan, which is operated by the Pakistani Ministry of Defence. This is a\npossible lure for the Indian targets to open the malicious attachment, and was also used in a similar attack\nin 2021.[xii]\n\nThe following are the details of one of the most recent Earth Karkaddan-related CapraRAT samples that we\nhave found in the wild:\n\n### • SHA-256: 8cb542f5793279b8a11af28e9352f41d400856a28e40ed1daa323b47f9ea3e3c\n\n • Filename: YouTube new.apk\n\nThis malware can collect a large amount of information from compromised devices. Some of its supported\nfeatures are as follows:\n\n### • Accesses the device's phone number\n\n • Launches other apps’ installation packages\n\n • Opens camera\n\n • Accesses the device's microphone and records audio clips\n\n • Accesses the device's registered country and network provider information\n\n • Accesses the device's unique identification number\n\n • Accesses the device's specific current location\n\n • Accesses the device's phone call history\n\n • Accesses the device's contacts\n\n\n-----\n\nIt should be noted that the malicious application relies on the user accepting several permissions upon\ninstallation to provide the RAT with access to the stored information and data on the device:\n\n**Permission** **Description**\n\n**_android.permission.RECEIVE_SMS_** Allows an application to monitor incoming SMS\nmessages to record or perform processing on\nthem\n\n**_android.permission.PROCESS_OUTGOING_CALLS_** Allows an application to monitor, modify, or\n\nabort outgoing calls\n\n**_android.permission.READ_CALL_LOG_** Allows an application to read a user's call log\n\n**_android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION_** Allows an application to access fine location\nsuch as GPS\n\n**_android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO_** Allows an application to record audio\n\n**_android.permission.READ_CONTACTS_** Allows an application to read a user's contact\n\ninformation\n\n**_android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION_** Allows an application to access coarse location\n\nsuch as cell-ID and Wi-Fi information\n\n**_android.permission.READ_SMS_** Allows an application to read SMS messages\n\n**_android.permission.INTERNET_** Allows applications to open network sockets\n\n**_android.permission.CAMERA_** Allows access to the device’s camera\n\n**_android.permission.AUTHENTICATE_ACCOUNTS_** Allows an application to act as an\n\n_AccountAuthenticator for the AccountManager_\n\n**_android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE_** Allows an application to read from external\n\nstorage\n\n**_android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE_** Allows applications to access information about\nWi-Fi networks\n\n**_android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE_** Allows read-only access to phone state\n\n**_android.permission.RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED_** Allows an application to receive the\n\n_ACTION_BOOT_COMPLETED command that is_\nbroadcast after the system finishes booting\n\n**_android.permission.GET_ACCOUNTS_** Allows access to the list of accounts in Accounts\nService\n\n**_android.permission.VIBRATE_** Allows access to the device’s vibrate function\n\n**_android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE_** Allows an application to write to external\n\nstorage\n\n**_android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE_** Allows applications to access information about\nnetworks\n\n|Permission|Description|\n|---|---|\n|android.permission.RECEIVE_SMS|Allows an application to monitor incoming SMS messages to record or perform processing on them|\n|android.permission.PROCESS_OUTGOING_CALLS|Allows an application to monitor, modify, or abort outgoing calls|\n|android.permission.READ_CALL_LOG|Allows an application to read a user's call log|\n|android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION|Allows an application to access fine location such as GPS|\n|android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO|Allows an application to record audio|\n|android.permission.READ_CONTACTS|Allows an application to read a user's contact information|\n|android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION|Allows an application to access coarse location such as cell-ID and Wi-Fi information|\n|android.permission.READ_SMS|Allows an application to read SMS messages|\n|android.permission.INTERNET|Allows applications to open network sockets|\n|android.permission.CAMERA|Allows access to the device’s camera|\n|android.permission.AUTHENTICATE_ACCOUNTS|Allows an application to act as an AccountAuthenticator for the AccountManager|\n|android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE|Allows an application to read from external storage|\n|android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE|Allows applications to access information about Wi-Fi networks|\n|android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE|Allows read-only access to phone state|\n|android.permission.RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED|Allows an application to receive the ACTION_BOOT_COMPLETED command that is broadcast after the system finishes booting|\n|android.permission.GET_ACCOUNTS|Allows access to the list of accounts in Accounts Service|\n|android.permission.VIBRATE|Allows access to the device’s vibrate function|\n|android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE|Allows an application to write to external storage|\n\n\n-----\n\n|android.permission.MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS|Allows an application to modify global audio settings|\n|---|---|\n\n\nUpon execution, the Andoid RAT will try to establish a connection with its C&C server,\n209[.]127[.]19[.]241[:]10284. It is worth noting that this IP address contains the “WIN-P9NRMH5G6M8”\nstring in the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) certificate which is commonly found in previously identified\nEarth Karkaddan C&C servers, as noted in a recent blog by Team Cymru.[xiii]\n\nFigure 23. Decompiled code from a CapraRAT connecting to its C&C server\n\nFigure 24. CapraRAT config showing the C&C server IP and Port\n\nIt will then wait for commands from the C&C server and execute them.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 25. Snippet of backdoor commands found in CapraRAT\n\nThis APK file also has the ability to drop mp4 or APK files from asset directory.\n\nFigure 26. CapraRAT APK file drops an mp4 file\n\nThe RAT also has a persistence mechanism that always keeps the app active. It checks whether the service\nis still running every minute, and if it is not, the service will be launched again.\n\nFigure 27. CapraRAT’s persistence mechanism\n\n\n-----\n\nWe have observed that some of the commands found in this Android RAT have names and functionalities\nsimilar to those from the Crimson RAT Windows malware. The following is a list of backdoor commands\nthat we have gathered from the file, with their corresponding descriptions. Please note that these\nfunctionalities might vary over time once the group releases new versions of this malware:\n\n**Command** **Description**\n\n**_afile_** Sends file to C&C\n\n**_calsre_** Sets call recordings and updates settings\n\n**_calstp_** Updates setting to stop call recording\n\n**_camoni_** Monitors calls\n\n**_camonis_** Stops call monitoring\n\n**_capbcam_** Captures photos from back camera then sends to C&C\n\n**_capfcam_** Capture photoS from front camera then send to C&C\n\n**_capscrn_** Captures single screenshot\n\n**_capscrns_** Captures screenshots continuously\n\n**_chkperm_** Checks permissions\n\n**_clogs_** Lists call logs\n\n**_clping_** Sets last communication time to current time\n\n**_cnls_** Stops certain functionalities like GPS and screen capture\n\n**_conta_** Lists contacts\n\n**_delnotif_** Deletes notifications (_HDENTIFI)\n\n**_delt_** Deletes files\n\n**_delth_** Deletes log files (_HDETALOG)\n\n**_dirs_** Lists drives\n\n**_dowf_** Gets file from C&C\n\n**_enbperm_** Enables permissions\n\n**_endpo_** Terminates processes using PID\n\n**_ffldr_** Sends list of directory and files\n\n**_file_** Sends file to C&C\n\n**_filsz_** Sends file information such as name, last modified date, and file size\n\n**_fldr_** Lists folders in a directory\n\n**_fles_** Lists files in a directory\n\n**_gcall_** Calls a number\n\n**_hidespp_** Hides applications\n\n|Command|Description|\n|---|---|\n|afile|Sends file to C&C|\n|calsre|Sets call recordings and updates settings|\n|calstp|Updates setting to stop call recording|\n|camoni|Monitors calls|\n|camonis|Stops call monitoring|\n|capbcam|Captures photos from back camera then sends to C&C|\n|capfcam|Capture photoS from front camera then send to C&C|\n|capscrn|Captures single screenshot|\n|capscrns|Captures screenshots continuously|\n|chkperm|Checks permissions|\n|clogs|Lists call logs|\n|clping|Sets last communication time to current time|\n|cnls|Stops certain functionalities like GPS and screen capture|\n|conta|Lists contacts|\n|delnotif|Deletes notifications (_HDENTIFI)|\n|delt|Deletes files|\n|delth|Deletes log files (_HDETALOG)|\n|dirs|Lists drives|\n|dowf|Gets file from C&C|\n|enbperm|Enables permissions|\n|endpo|Terminates processes using PID|\n|ffldr|Sends list of directory and files|\n|file|Sends file to C&C|\n|filsz|Sends file information such as name, last modified date, and file size|\n|fldr|Lists folders in a directory|\n|fles|Lists files in a directory|\n|gcall|Calls a number|\n\n\n-----\n\n|info|Sends device information such as country code, phone number, sim country code, sim serial, and point-of-service (POS) network|\n|---|---|\n|lgps|Sends GPS location then stops using GPS|\n|listf|Searches for files given a list of extensions|\n|lntwok|Sends network location then stops using GPS|\n|mlgps|Sends GPS location|\n|mlntwok|Sends network location|\n|msurc|Sets media source setting|\n|nofia|Currently does nothing/reserved|\n|nofid|Disables notifications|\n|notifi|Sends file notification (_HDENTIFI)|\n|procl|Sends running processes|\n|recpth|Sends rec file (_HAATNECS_)|\n|runf|Runs a file|\n|scresize|Sets screen size|\n|scrtops|Stops screenshot|\n|sesms|Sends SMS|\n|setgpse|Enables GPS service|\n|setnoti|Sets notification service|\n|setnotif|Listens to notifications|\n|setscrn|Starts screen capture|\n|showspp|Shows applications|\n|smslg|Lists SMS|\n|smsmon|Monitors SMS|\n|smsmons|Stops SMS monitoring|\n|stoast|Shows toast|\n|stpre|Stops microphone recording|\n|stsre|Starts microphone recording|\n|supdat|Updates application|\n|thumb|Gets the 200x150 GIF thumbnail of a given image|\n|uclntn|Updates userid setting|\n\n\n**_udlt_** Sets remUser as true then updates settings\n\n\n-----\n\n|unsnotif|Cancels notification service|\n|---|---|\n|vibr|Sets vibration parameters|\n\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\nA list of indicators can be found in this text file.\n\n\n-----\n\n## References\n\ni Jai Vijayan.
