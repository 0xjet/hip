This report\napplies to assessments conducted on behalf of the National Supervisory Control\nand Data Acquisition (SCADA) Test Bed (NSTB) program. The mission is to\nhelp industry and government improve the security of the control systems used in\ncritical energy infrastructures throughout the United States. A key part of this\nmission is the assessment of control systems to identify vulnerabilities that could\nput critical infrastructures at risk from a cyber attack.\n\nThis document presents results from 16 control system assessments\nperformed under the NSTB program from 2003 through 2007. Information found\nin individual stakeholder reports is protected from disclosure. Researchers\nrecognized that many systems had similar types of findings, and that this\ninformation could be of great benefit to those in industry responsible for control\nsystem security. For this reason, vulnerability information was collected,\nanalyzed, and organized into general categories based on a control system\nsecurity metrics approach.\n\nCommon vulnerabilities were derived from similar assessment findings and\ngrouped into general security dimensions and sub-categories based on analysis\nusing an INL-developed taxonomy. Mitigation strategies for these findings are\nprovided in each section.\n\nInformation found in this report can benefit vendors, asset owners, and other\nstakeholders responsible for securing the systems that control the nation’s critical\ninfrastructure. System vendors learn of common weaknesses in control system\napplications, services, and protocols, and how to better secure their products\nwhile asset owners can evaluate possible weaknesses in their installed system\nconfigurations and how they can fix or mitigate them with secure firewall\nconfigurations, intrusion detection systems, and network architectures.\nUnderstanding the types of vulnerabilities commonly found and how to mitigate\nthem can serve to help protect the systems currently in development as well as\nthose already installed in critical infrastructure applications.\n\nThe current overall impact of the INL NSTB program on the stakeholder\ncommunity encompasses strong user interest in the information from the\nassessment reports. Utilities have requested assessments of their sites, and both\nutilities and vendors have requested follow-up assessments on the vendors’\ncontrol system software. Knowledge gained through control system security\nassessments has been shared with over 1,800 individuals through security\nawareness training, and specific vendor-approved findings have been presented at\nvendor user group conferences.\n\nThis document represents a steadily growing understanding of control system\nsecurity issues and methods for mitigating current vulnerabilities as well as new\ntechnologies and approaches being developed in response to security challenges.\nThe effort is expanding to new technologies, such as substation automation and\nSmart Grid, as the program seeks a continuing understanding of the systems\nbeing planned for and deployed in the energy sector critical infrastructure.\n\niii\n\n\n-----\n\niv\n\n\n-----\n\n#### CONTENTS\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY .........................................................................................................................iii\n\nACRONYMS..............................................................................................................................................vii\n\n1.

INTRODUCTION\n\nThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) established the National Supervisory Control and Data\nAcquisition (SCADA) Test Bed (NSTB) program to assist industry and government improve the security\nof control systems used in the nation’s critical energy infrastructures. The NSTB Program is funded and\ndirected by the DOE Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability (DOE-OE). A key part of the\nprogram is the assessment of control systems to identify and provide mitigation approaches for\nvulnerabilities that could put the systems at risk to a cyber attack.\n\nAssessments are performed in the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) SCADA Test Bed and in\noperational installations at utilities, generation plants, and energy management facilities. Control system\nvendor software is tested in the SCADA Test Bed at INL. Operational control system assessments use\nnonintrusive methods, such as reviewing the production system network diagrams and firewall rules, and\nperforming a hands-on assessment of a duplicate non-production installation of the system.\n\nSCADA systems are of the greatest interest in the assessments because they are the most common\ntype of control system in the energy sector, controlling equipment ranging from valves in oil and gas\npipelines to switches and breakers in the national electric grid. If compromised, an attacker could utilize\nthese systems to cause catastrophic damage or outages directly or by exploiting paths to critical end\ndevices or connected SCADA systems.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### 2. ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGIES\n\nThe primary goal of the INL cyber assessment tasks is to improve the security of the energy\ninfrastructure by delivering to each industry partner a report of all security problems found during the\nassessment along with associated recommendations for improving the security of their product or\ninfrastructure (as appropriate). With this in mind, INL has performed assessments on a large variety of\nsystems. Some systems have been assessed after being set up in the INL test bed while others have been\nassessed onsite in production facilities. Regardless of where the work took place, an assessment plan and\nmethodology are tailored to provide the most value to the customer owning the system. To accomplish\nthis, assessment methodologies differed significantly between laboratory and onsite assessments, and\neven across systems.\n\nSystem configurations varied considerably depending on control system functionality, negotiated\nobjectives, and whether the assessment was conducted in the laboratory or onsite. In all cases, the\narchitecture and boundaries for the system under test are carefully determined. Assessment targets are\ndeveloped individually for each assessment based on the system configuration and assessment focus\nbecause a comprehensive system assessment is not possible given project funding and the complex nature\nof control systems. Although a common approach is used for all assessments, the details of each\nassessment vary; the fact that a vulnerability was not listed on a particular system report does not imply\nthat it did not exist on that system. Common vulnerabilities listed in this report are therefore limited to\nthose tested for and found in multiple systems.\n\nLaboratory assessments are designed to evaluate vendor-specific products and services, such as\ncustom protocols, field equipment, applications, and services. The model is to assess systems in multiple\nphases: (1) a baseline system assessment that identifies vulnerabilities in the vendor’s default\nconfiguration, and (2) an evaluation of the system following implementation of mitigation strategies\nbased on baseline assessment results. In some cases, more than two assessments have been performed on\ndifferent versions of a control system. After a system has been tested in the laboratory, an assessment is\nusually performed on an asset-owner installed version of the system. This provides an opportunity to\nwork with owners and operators and help validate the impact and possible mitigation strategies for\nvulnerabilities identified in the laboratory assessment.\n\nAssessment projects typically leverage a full-disclosure approach with the vendor and asset-owner\npartners. The INL focus is on the control system and its perimeter. By collecting background architecture,\npolicy, and configuration data from a project partner, the team can perform a more thorough assessment\nof the system. Penetration testing is a security validation process performed by many commercial entities.\nINL does not simulate a blind attack or penetration of the system, but instead works with the project\npartner to gain the best understanding possible and provide insight to help mitigate vulnerabilities found\nin their control systems.\n\nA laboratory assessment generally starts with a basic information technology (IT) assessment of the\nsystem, including port scanning, vulnerability scanning, network mapping, password cracking, and\nnetwork sniffing and fuzzing. Typical tools used in testing can be found in the Permann and Rohde\nreport.[1] In addition to the IT assessment, specific targets or functional pieces of the system are evaluated.\nThese targets are referred to as Assessment Targets. Testing is often conducted on the control system\nlocal area network (LAN), with the assumption that the attacker has penetrated perimeter protection and is\non the control system network. Typical assessment targets may be “Changing Alarms and Commands” or\n“Unauthorized Database Access.” If the test environment contains connections external to the control\nsystem network, such as to the corporate network, field equipment, or Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), these\nconnections can be assessed. Typical assessment targets for this portion of the control system may be\n“Compromise the Front End Processor” or “Assess Vulnerabilities in DMZ Servers.”\n\n\n-----\n\nAssessment targets are given a priority based on the level of functionality they provide to the system\nand their operational impacts to the system. Each target is allocated an appropriate amount of testing time\naccording to its priority level. The time frame may be modified during the assessment based on testing\nresults. Depending on the complexity of the system, testing time for laboratory assessments is generally\nallotted up to 900 cyber security researcher-hours. The impact to the system is described and a mitigation\nstrategy is proposed for each finding identified.\n\nOnsite system assessments generally assess how securely external connections, firewall\nconfigurations, intrusion detection systems (IDS), network architecture, and any other components are\ndeployed and installed. These assessments generally leverage findings from laboratory assessments with\nthe associated control system vendor. This has been coined “ground truthing” because laboratory\nassessment findings are validated on installed systems. This interaction includes discussion on the\nviability of possible mitigations and defenses. Onsite assessments generally include 2 weeks of\nassessment at the asset owner’s site, and can take up to 300 cyber security researcher-hours.\n\nAssessment plans are tailored to each system and to each vendor. Objectives outlined in the\nassessment plan cover steps that might be potential goals of a real attacker attempting to exploit the\ncontrol system and cause damage to equipment, interrupt service, or harm people or the environment.\n\n#### 2.1 Laboratory Assessments\n\nLaboratory assessments are performed under Cooperative Research and Development Agreements\n(CRADAs) or Nondisclosure Agreements (NDAs) between the system vendors and Battelle Energy\nAlliance (BEA). BEA, which currently manages the INL contract, is hereafter referred to as INL. Under\nthese agreements, the vendors provide hardware, software, and technical support. INL develops the test\nplans, performs the cyber security assessments, and reports the results. These agreements also protect the\nvendor from public disclosure of the assessment findings.\n\nAssessments are usually performed on the latest release of the vendors’ systems using a base, typical\nor turnkey installation. This allows INL to influence the system that is currently under development.\nIdentifying a baseline or default architecture is generally difficult since every installation includes some\ndegree of custom configuration. Vendors may support multiple operating systems, features, and control\nsystem protocols. Customers can choose from an assortment of functionality, which can be separated on\ndifferent servers or combined on one, and many levels of redundancy can be provided. Therefore, INL\nworks closely with each vendor to ensure that to the extent possible, the components most commonly\nfound in customer facilities are included in the test architecture.\n\n#### 2.2 Onsite Assessments\n\nOnsite assessments are performed under a CRADA or NDA agreement between INL and the industry\npartner. Onsite assessments differ from laboratory assessments largely in the amount of time spent on\ntesting and the functional areas of a system the testing focuses on. Onsite assessments are completed in 2\nor 3 weeks, as compared to 2 or 3 months for more in-depth laboratory assessments. Since an intrusive\nexamination of the operational control system itself is not appropriate and system owners and operators\ncannot modify the control system software themselves, the focus for onsite assessments is usually\nnetwork security and perimeter protection. These are the main areas they have direct control of for\nmitigating findings on their assessment and the associated vendor assessment.\n\nThe focus of the assessment is changed in order to analyze a fielded system and how it is\nimplemented and protected in production. This changes the assessment to resemble a “network security\nlayers of defense” analysis. This includes a review and tour of the production system to help identify\nthrough documentation, observation, and conversation any possible security problems with the production\n\n\n-----\n\nsystem and network configuration without putting the operational system at risk. Analysis of the actual\nsite’s control system software is done on a backup or test system so that the custom installation can be\nevaluated based on vulnerabilities found in the associated vendor laboratory assessment. Any mitigating\nrecommendations can then be given to the customer while the vendor fixes the underlying problem.\n\n#### 2.3 Impact on Stakeholder Community\n\nSince the inception of the program, the reports generated from the assessment of control system\nproducts and installations have been used by vendors and asset owners to understand and mitigate cyber\nvulnerabilities found during each assessment. Although not all findings have been addressed, most\nsystems have been modified to improve security based on assessment reports. Some of the vendors have\nbeen forthright in sharing the results with their customers and some have felt that any disclosure of\nvulnerabilities could lead to exposure of their customers to potential cyber attacks. Whether results were\nshared with control system customers or not, security awareness has been increased by sharing control\nsystem security knowledge gained through the assessment process. Cyber security and control system\nresearchers have presented results and provided security training to attendees of the various vendor user\ngroup conferences. Most user groups have established breakout sessions and working groups dedicated\nwholly to control system cyber security issues. Some of these sessions have evolved into user\nconsortiums and other arrangements with vendors to fund additional control system assessments.\n\nThe NSTB onsite assessments have been conducted at utilities in order to help secure the particular\nsite, verify laboratory findings, and gather common recommendations that are then shared with other\nutilities. This brings laboratory vendor assessments full circle to help the control system software, its\nimplementations in the field, and the associated critical infrastructure become more secure.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### 3. COMMON ASSESSMENT FINDINGS\n\nThe INL Control Systems and Cyber Security Test Center is a research facility designed to evaluate\ncontrol systems representative of those used in the United States critical energy infrastructure. It was\nestablished through a collaboration of the DOE-OE NSTB and the Department of Homeland Security\nControl System Security Program to assess and help improve the security of control systems, which have\nnot had the exposure, scrutiny, and security culture change that common IT applications have received.\nUnderstanding the unique priorities, vulnerabilities, impacts, limitations, and operation inherent in control\nsystems has been a research effort with evolving assessment procedures. As a result, assessments are\ncustomized and tailored to the specific control system and the aspects of the system that its vendor and\nINL determine require the most scrutiny. Assessments are a combination of targets based on perceived\nvulnerability, impact or exposure of system components and functionality, and evaluation of security\nmeasures built into, or placed around, the control system.\n\nEven though there is a common general theme and assessment methodology, all systems have not\nbeen tested for the same vulnerabilities. For example, many assessment goals are result-based, which tests\nwhether an action such as causing a breaker to close could be accomplished by any means, instead of a\nmethodical assessment approach that tests for a given set of potential security flaws. Another factor that\ncontributed to the disparity of vulnerability tests was that all systems configured for assessment do not\nhave the same set of components and functionality. Control systems inherently have many configuration\noptions, such as:\n\n- Operating system\n\n- Functionality shared on the same computer\n\n- Amount of redundancy\n\n- Connected field devices\n\n- Protocols used to communicate with field devices\n\n- Security features such as security zones, intrusion detection, and update methods.\n\nThe size and architecture of assessed systems varied widely. For example, assessed systems ranged\nfrom:\n\n- A control system with the most basic functionality on a single LAN with a few computers\n\n- A control system with partial optional functionality, simulated data, and some network security\ndefense devices\n\n- All available control system functionality connected to a remote terminal unit (RTU) with the\nrecommended network architecture and perimeter defenses\n\n- An operational system connected to the U.S. power grid with duplicate system for interactive testing.\n\nThis disparity leads to differences in assessment focus based on what was available on the system for\nassessment and priority lists for which part of the system will be evaluated in the allotted timeframe.\n\nCommon NSTB assessment findings in this report were not derived from a comprehensive or even\nconsistent set of assessments or fully operational control systems. The common assessment findings that\nfollow are similar security problems found on two or more unique control system configurations. It\ncannot be inferred that vulnerabilities not included in this report are not common to control systems or\nthat three similar findings under a common vulnerability means that only three systems assessed were\nsusceptible to that vulnerability.\n\n\n-----\n\nTable 1 lists the common vulnerabilities categorized based on the taxonomy described in Appendix\nA. The security dimensions represent the main system attributes that affect the risk of loss from cyber\nattacks. These security dimensions are further subdivided into categories of problems that lead to\nvulnerabilities. A common vulnerability describes findings from a minimum of two assessments.\n\nThe assessment findings described in this report are organized according to the security dimension\nand category in which they belong. Vulnerability descriptions are generalized to remove specific vendoridentifying information and details that would hinder the ability to group common vulnerabilities.\nSanitized assessment details are included inside each common vulnerability description to aid in\nunderstanding the real issues. Multiple assessments may have findings that match the same vulnerability\ndetails, and one assessment may have multiple specific detailed vulnerabilities relating to one common\nvulnerability. Some common vulnerabilities have only one detailed example that describes all findings\nfrom the associated assessments. The number of systems with a given vulnerability are not listed to avoid\nany implication that all systems were tested for that vulnerability and to help lend anonymity to the\ncontrol systems associated with common vulnerabilities and related specific details.\n\nTable 1. Summary of common NSTB control system assessment findings to date.\n\n|Security Dimension|Category|Common Vulnerability|\n|---|---|---|\n|Security Group (SG) Knowledge|Change Management Deficiencies|Network access rules not removed when no longer needed - 3.1.1.1|\n||Documentation Deficiencies|Inaccurate critical asset documentation - 3.1.2.1|\n|Attack Group (AG) Knowledge|Information Leaks|Unencrypted services common in IT systems – 3.2.1.1|\n|||Weak protection of user credentials – 3.2.1.2|\n|||Unencrypted proprietary control system protocol communication – 3.2.1.3|\n|||Unencrypted non-proprietary control system protocol communication – 3.2.1.4|\n|||Unencrypted Inter-Control Center Communications Protocol (ICCP) communication – 3.2.1.5|\n|Access|Firewall Filtering Deficiencies|Access to specific ports on host not restricted to required Internet Protocol (IP) addresses – 3.3.1.1|\n|||Access not restricted to required one-way communication initiation – 3.3.1.2|\n||Remote Access Deficiencies|Unauthorized access through Virtual Private Network (VPN) – 3.3.2.1|\n|||Unauthorized access through remote display applications – 3.3.2.2|\n||Physical Access|Physical access to network equipment – 3.3.3.1|\n|Vulnerability|Lack of Input Validation|Buffer overflow in control system service – 3.4.1.1|\n|||Integer overflow in control system service – 3.4.1.2|\n|||Lack of bounds checking in control system service – 3.4.1.3|\n|||Structured Query Language (SQL) injection vulnerability – 3.4.1.4|\n\n\n-----\n\nUnpatched third-party application – 3.4.5.2\n\n#### 3.1 Security Group Knowledge Security Dimension\n\nThe security group knowledge ideal is defined as aspects of the system or associated management\nprocesses that impact the ability of the security group to know the system and manage changes to the\nsystem. Assessment findings show that inadequate documentation and communications prevented\nsecurity groups from having accurate knowledge of network and asset configurations.\n\n##### 3.1.1 Vulnerability Category: Change Management Deficiencies\n\nThe security group knowledge of the system may not be accurate if changes to the system are not\nproperly managed. If there are no tools or processes to support the tracking of changes, the security group\nknowledge of the control system will be outdated. Unmanaged changes lead to more access allowed than\nnecessary because legacy firewall exceptions, undocumented connections, and unused user accounts exist.\n\n**_3.1.1.1 Common Vulnerability: Network access rules not removed when no longer_**\n**_needed_**\n\nRules that allowed unnecessary network access were found during assessments (see Section 4.3). This\nindicated that network equipment was not being updated when the network configuration or\ncommunication paths changed. This showed a lack of change management procedures for removing\nfirewall rules when hosts were removed from the network. Legacy firewall configurations indicate\ninaccurate knowledge of the current network and may indicate that network administrators are not aware\nof some potential attack paths. Unneeded firewall access rules may expose vulnerabilities on hosts for\npotential exploitation. The unneeded firewall rules also may increase the possibility of introducing errors\nwhile making modifications to firewall configurations.\n\nThe following are three specific assessment findings associated with this vulnerability:\n\n- Hosts do not appear to exist; however, there are rules pertaining to these hosts\n\n|Security Dimension|Category|Common Vulnerability|\n|---|---|---|\n|||Control system protocol uses weak integrity checks – 3.4.2.4|\n||Communication Protocols with Weak or No Authentication|Standard IT protocol encryption can be defeated – 3.4.2.1|\n|||Standard IT protocol uses clear text authentication|\n|||Control system protocol uses weak authentication – 3.4.2.2|\n||Weak User Authentication|Improper security configuration – 3.4.3.1|\n|||No password required – 3.4.3.2|\n|||Weak passwords – 3.4.3.3|\n||Least Privileges not Enforced|Unauthorized directory traversal allowed – 3.4.4.1|\n|||Services running with unnecessary privileges – 3.4.4.2|\n|||Control system protocols with unnecessary functionality – 3.4.4.3|\n||Unpatched Systems|Unpatched operating system – 3.4.5.1|\n|||Unpatched third-party application – 3.4.5.2|\n\n\n-----\n\n- All hosts on the control system LAN have unrestricted access to the IP address of a since-removed\nexternal server\n\n- Routers have what appear to be legacy configuration entries.\n\n**Recommendation: Change management procedures need to be created and enforced to ensure unneeded**\naccess rules are removed as they become unnecessary.\n\n**_3.1.1.2 Mitigations for change management deficiencies category_**\n\nChange management is necessary for accurate system state knowledge and accountability. It is also\nnecessary for compliance to industry regulations. Create and follow change management processes to\nupdate router, switch, and firewall configurations, user accounts, etc. This change management procedure\nshould also include compliance and security group documentation updates.\n\n##### 3.1.2 Vulnerability Category: Documentation Deficiencies\n\nThere are different types of technical documentation and all play an important role for the smooth\noperation of systems and organizations. It is important to maintain current information on hardware and\nsoftware component configurations used in the control system’s architecture. Other materials are\nimportant for maintaining systems, such as user guides for installation, reference, and repair. Business\npolicy and procedures, emergency response procedures, security policies, as well as training manuals\nimprove the communication and management process.\n\n**_3.1.2.1 Common Vulnerability: Inaccurate documentation_**\n\nIn many onsite assessments, documentation was found to either be inaccurate or outdated. Inaccurate\nnetwork and asset documentation may lead to inadequate access control implementations and other\nsecurity protections by the security group.\n\nFour specific assessment findings associated with this vulnerability are:\n\n- Critical asset documentation was incorrect or outdated\n\n- There was a disconnect between the corporate IT networking and control system networking groups,\nwhich fostered misconfiguration of critical networking resources\n\n- Network did not match drawings or documentation\n\n- IT and control system departments used different names for the same servers.\n\n**Recommendation: Timely and accurate communications between the IT and control system departments**\nneeds to be promoted. Integrated plant-specific security plans, policies, and procedures need to be\nestablished with the support of senior management, IT and control system groups to be applied and\nstandardized between facilities or subsystems within a facility.\n\nSpecifically, configuration management procedures that apply to keeping documentation current\nwhen assets are acquired or removed must be used and enforced. Periodic reviews and audits should be\nscheduled to ensure configuration documentation is accurate.\n\n**_3.1.2.2 Mitigations for documentation deficiencies category_**\n\nOnce the asset documentation has been completed, documents must be kept current through the same\nchange management procedures that keep the network, host, and account configurations current.\nWhenever assets are added or removed, or the network is reconfigured, the change management\n\n\n-----\n\nprocedures should be followed to update any affected network and critical asset regulatory compliance\nand security group documentation.\n\n##### 3.1.3 Vulnerability Category: Procedure Deficiencies\n\nNo common vulnerabilities were found in the procedure deficiencies category. This does not mean\nthat there were not common procedure deficiencies in the systems assessed. It should only be inferred that\ndue to the nature of the custom assessment plans and systems, common security group procedure\nproblems were not tested for and discovered in at least two systems.\n\n##### 3.1.4 Security Group Knowledge Summary\n\nTwo categories with common vulnerabilities were identified in the security group knowledge\ndimension. Change management deficiencies led to legacy network access rules not being removed from\nfirewalls and routers, which allowed access paths to hosts and ports that were no longer needed.\nDocumentation deficiencies resulted in inaccurate critical asset documentation (see Table 2).\n\nTable 2. Frequency of security group knowledge common vulnerabilities by category.\n\nVulnerability Category Number of Unique Detailed Finding Descriptions\nDocumentation Deficiency 4\nChange Management Deficiency 3\nProcedure Deficiency 0\n\n**_3.1.4.1 Summary of Recommendations for Security Group Knowledge Dimension_**\n\nSystem tools and associated management processes should provide the security group with current\nand accurate knowledge of the system and manage changes to the system. This includes configuration and\nchange management tools and procedures that support the tracking of changes, collection and analysis of\nsystem logs, and forensics. Common findings indicate the need for a greater focus on documentation and\ninformation sharing of accurate network and asset configurations.\n\nOnce the asset documentation has been completed, documents must be kept current using the same\nconfiguration control procedures used for network, host, and account configurations. Whenever assets are\nadded or removed, or the network is reconfigured, the change management procedures must be followed\nto update any affected network and critical asset regulatory compliance and security group\ndocumentation.\n\nChange management processes must be enforced to ensure system knowledge and documentation is\ncurrent and accurate.\n\n#### 3.2 Attack Group Knowledge Security Dimension\n\nThe Attack Group Knowledge dimension of security is the set of system attributes, processes, or\nactions that provide potential attackers with the means to gain information about the system.\n\nAn attacker must find information about the target control system and discover details about the\nprocess under its control before he can create an attack against it. If the attacker’s goal is merely to shut\ndown the process, very little discovery is needed. However, if the attacker intends a surgical attack or\nprocess manipulation, specific details are needed. Some primary sources of information about the process\n\n|Vulnerability Category|Number of Unique Detailed Finding Descriptions|\n|---|---|\n|Documentation Deficiency|4|\n|Change Management Deficiency|3|\n|Procedure Deficiency|0|\n\n\n-----\n\non the control system LAN are the traffic, points database, and the operator’s screens. The points database\nassigns numbers to each device, such as a switch or breaker. An attacker planning a surgical strike on the\nprocess needs the point information because, at the protocol level, each device is often referred to by\nnumber only. The operator’s screens are generally the easiest way to understand the process.\n\nAssessment findings show that use of clear text communications and access to system source code\nand configuration data are potential weaknesses that could aid an attacker in compromising the integrity\nof the control system. The open source availability of information regarding the software, devices,\ntopology, configuration, and purpose of a control system was not significantly addressed in any of the\nassessments to date.\n\n##### 3.2.1 Vulnerability Category: Information Leaks\n\nCredentials sent across the network in clear text leave the system at risk to the unauthorized use of a\nlegitimate user’s credentials. If an attacker is able to capture a username and password, he will be able to\nlog onto the system with that user’s privileges. Any unencrypted information concerning the control\nsystem’s source code, topology, or devices is a potential boon for an attacker and should be limited.\n\n**_3.2.1.1 Common Vulnerability: Unencrypted Services Common in IT Systems_**\n\nUnsecure services developed for IT systems have been adopted for use in control systems for\ncommon IT functionality. Although more secure alternatives exist for most of these services, active\nunused or obsolete services still exist in many control systems. Unfortunately, this has led to\nvulnerabilities readily accessible to an attacker who has gained a toe hold on the control system or has\naccess to an unencrypted communication channel to or from the system. For example, management of\nnetwork devices using clear text communication provides an attacker the opportunity to learn about the\nsystem’s configuration and to more effectively plan his continued attack. Further, the storage of control\nsystem artifacts, such as source code and system configuration on an unprotected file system, provides\nsignificant potential for information mining by an attacker.\n\nThe following are six specific assessment findings associated with this vulnerability:\n\n- Use of clear text IT protocols on control system LAN (e.g., telnet, ftp, “r” services). This finding was\ncommon to multiple assessments.\n\n- Network File System (NFS), which has relatively limited security features, is used as the network file\nsystem.\n\n- The clear text IT protocol, telnet, is used to access and manage network equipment.\n\n- The clear text IT protocols, File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP),\nare used for configuration and file transfers to RTUs.\n\n- Access to clear text vendor proprietary services for management of network equipment is not limited\nsolely to the necessary devices.\n\n- Management of network equipment from the corporate network into the control network is\naccomplished using a clear text service.\n\n**Recommendation: Encryption is the obvious answer to information leaks due to clear text**\ncommunication. Unfortunately, encryption is not always feasible on control system networks. Timing\nconcerns may make encryption impractical, and, in addition, encryption reduces the ability to monitor\nnetwork traffic and to troubleshoot the system.\n\nUnsecure versions of common IT services should be replaced where possible by their secure versions.\nControl systems use common IT protocols for common IT functionality, such as network device\n\n\n-----\n\nmanagement, remote logins, or file transfers. Since they are not used for real-time functionality, they can\nbe replaced with their secure counterparts in most cases. Secure shell (SSH) can replace all file transfer\nand remote login protocols such as FTP, telnet, and rlogin with encrypted versions. Any communication\ncan be “tunneled” through SSH. Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) can be sent over the Secure Socket\nLayer (HTTPS). There are more secure network file sharing solutions available also. Control system\nvendors and customers should follow IT security practices and use the current secure versions of common\nprotocols. When replacement is not feasible, access to the services should be minimized and unencrypted\ncommunication should be limited to within the control system whenever possible. Communications\nbetween security zones should be secured as much as possible.\n\n**_3.2.1.2 Common Vulnerability: Weak protection of user credentials_**\n\nUser credentials should be vigorously protected and made inaccessible to an attacker. Whenever\ncredentials are passed in clear text, they are susceptible to being captured and then cracked if necessary by\nthe attacker. If stored password hashes are not properly protected, they may be accessed by an attacker\nand cracked. In every case, the lack of protection of user credentials may lead to the attacker gaining\nincreased privileges on the control system and thus being able to more effectively advance his attack.\n\nThe following are two specific assessment findings associated with this vulnerability:\n\n- Services such as FTP, telnet, and rlogin transmit user credentials in clear text\n\n- Password hash files are not properly secured.\n\n**Recommendation: Properly secure password files by making hashed passwords more difficult to acquire**\n(e.g., restrict access by using a shadow password file or equivalent on UNIX systems). Replace or modify\nservices so that all user credentials are passed through an encrypted channel.\n\n**_3.2.1.3 Common Vulnerability: Unencrypted proprietary control system protocol_**\n**_communication_**\n\nClear text communications without authentication and integrity checks offer an attacker the\nopportunity to intercept and alter the communications. The captured communications may be used to\nreverse engineer the proprietary protocols and to modify or insert commands in ways which suit the\nattacker’s purpose.\n\nThe following are two specific assessment findings associated with this vulnerability:\n\n- A proprietary protocol and service required the firewall to allow incoming connections to the control\nsystem on a large number of ports using unencrypted communication\n\n- A common finding was that the backbone control system proprietary communication protocol was\nclear text and susceptible to being reverse engineered.\n\n**Recommendation: When possible, standard secure versions of services should be used. When**\nproprietary protocols are used, they should, ideally, be encrypted and every message’s integrity validated.\nIf it is not feasible to encrypt messages or provide encrypted channels, access to the proprietary protocols\nand associated communications should be kept to a minimum level and, preferably, kept within the\nconfines of a well-protected control system security zone.\n\n**_3.2.1.4 Common Vulnerability: Unencrypted Non-proprietary Control System Protocol_**\n**_Communication_**\n\nClear text communications without authentication and integrity checks offer an attacker the\nopportunity to intercept and alter the communications. The captured communications may be used to\n\n\n-----\n\nbetter understand the specific structural function of the various field devices in the system, and to modify\nor insert commands in ways which suit the attacker’s purpose.\n\nThe following is a specific common assessment finding associated with this vulnerability:\n\n- Communication between the front end processor (FEP) and RTUs was unencrypted and susceptible to\nreverse engineering to effectively alter values to and from field devices.\n\n**Recommendation: Future protocols should be designed with greater security including encrypted**\nmessaging. If possible, immediate application of encrypted channels would be beneficial. If supported by\nthe field devices, it would be useful to configure the field equipment to only allow connections from the\nIP addresses of the systems that are expected to connect to those devices. While not preventing\ninformation leakage, this mitigation could make a successful attack more difficult.\n\n**_3.2.1.5 Common Vulnerability: Unencrypted ICCP communication_**\n\nThe Inter-Control Center Communications Protocol (ICCP) is an open protocol used internationally\nin the electric power industry to exchange data among utilities, regional transmission operators,\nindependent power producers, and others. The clear text data exchange may provide many opportunities\nfor an attacker to intercept, understand, and alter the data being exchanged.\n\nA specific assessment finding associated with this vulnerability is clear text ICCP traffic.\n\n**Recommendation: The preferred mitigation is to adopt the secure version of ICCP so that all**\ncommunication is appropriately encrypted. This solution is dependent on whether data-sharing peers\nsupport secure ICCP. Whether ICCP is encrypted or not, the connection is still with an outside entity;\ntreat ICCP as an untrustworthy connection, place the ICCP server in a separate DMZ, and monitor it\nclosely.\n\n**_3.2.1.6 Mitigations for Information Leaks Category_**\n\nAvailability of system information including topology, configuration, user credentials, protocol\nspecification, and specific device function are of significant value to an attacker. As a consequence, a\nvariety of mitigations would reduce the potential for information leakage.\n\nWherever encryption of messages is feasible, it should be done. This may include the replacement of\nstandard insecure services with their secure counterparts or may, in some cases, involve migration away\nfrom unencrypted proprietary protocols to more standard and secure services.\n\nControl system communications should be isolated to the extent possible with a network partitioning\nand defense-in-depth strategies that use switches, firewalls, access control lists, and DMZs, thus\nminimizing an attacker’s access to different portions of the control system’s messaging.\n\nAlso, all unnecessary system documentation should be removed from the system. Required system\ndocumentation should only reside on the necessary system devices, which should be minimized, and\naccess to that information should be restricted to the greatest extent possible.\n\n##### 3.2.2 Vulnerability Category: Open Source Information Available\n\nAvailability of open source information concerning the software, devices, topology, configuration,\nand purpose of a control system may be the first criteria in an attacker’s identification and selection of a\ntarget. To a degree, the accessibility of the information is not strictly in the control of individual owners\nor vendors. However, it is possible to establish a process to baseline the information that has been made\n\n\n-----\n\npublicly available on the product, and to then track and respond to the increase or decrease of the\navailable information over time.\n\n**_3.2.2.1 Common Vulnerability: Default Passwords_**\n\nIn the assessments used to generate the set of common vulnerabilities, there was no systematic\ninvestigation of open source information related to the control system, and little analysis of the potential\nuses of such information to an attacker. The investigations that were done focused on default passwords\nand their use in the operational system. If default passwords are retained, it would be a significant\nwindfall for an attacker. However, this potential vulnerability was not found on multiple assessments, and\ntherefore does not yet qualify as a common vulnerability.\n\n**Recommendation: Not applicable.**\n\n**_3.2.2.2 Mitigations for open source information available category_**\n\nThe first step in mitigation of the potential vulnerabilities associated with publicly available, opensource information is to become aware of the information that is published and available about the control\nsystem.\n\nThe second step is to develop mitigations for the publicly available information. In the case of\ninformation about a code error or security flaw being published, a good patch management program might\nbe used to ensure that timely solutions to counter the threat are implemented. Information, such as default\npasswords, can be assumed to be available information and should be changed. A full discussion of\npossible mitigations is pending a more thorough investigation of the types and qualities of open source\ninformation that is available to potential attackers and commonality of the resulting vulnerabilities.\n\n##### 3.2.3 Attack Group Knowledge Summary\n\nOnly one category with common vulnerabilities was identified in the attack group knowledge\ndimension. Information leaks were caused by unencrypted control system protocols and common IT\nservices, and weak protection of user credentials.\n\n#### 3.3 Access Security Dimension\n\nAccess is the dimension of security that provides a potential attacker with the ability to send or\nreceive data to or from a component of the control system from the attacker’s location. The first step in\ngaining control of a control system is to gain unauthorized access to the control system LAN. Fortunately,\nmost control system networks are no longer directly accessible from the Internet. It is now common\nindustry practice to separate the business LAN from the control system LAN with a firewall. The firewall\nhelps prevent unauthorized access and isolates the control system LAN from worms and other maladies\nthat may infect the corporate network. Often a separate LAN, the DMZ, is created to share data between\nthe corporate and control system LANs and to keep non-control system applications off the control\nsystem LAN.\n\nTo access the control system LAN, the attacker must first bypass the perimeter defense provided by\nthe firewall or find another avenue onto the control system LAN. The attacker can use a number of\nproven techniques, such as piggybacking, on a connection or exploiting a service allowed through the\nfirewall, discovering an auto-answer modem or connection circumventing the firewall, or gaining access\n\n\n-----\n\nthrough a trusted peer site. The attacker does need to maintain access to the control system network in\norder to accomplish the rest of the attack.\n\nVulnerabilities that were reported fell into the categories of physical access attack vectors, network\npartitioning deficiencies, firewall filtering deficiencies, and services allowed into the control system.\nMost access violation findings fell into the firewall filtering deficiencies category. Inadequate incoming\naccess restrictions findings outweighed all other access control vulnerabilities reported.\n\n##### 3.3.1 Vulnerability Category: Firewall Filtering Deficiencies \n\nFirewall and router filtering deficiencies include access to control system components through\nexternal and internal networks. The lack of incoming access restrictions creates access paths into critical\nnetworks.\n\nThe lack of outgoing access restrictions allows access from internal components that may have been\ncompromised. For an attacker to remotely control exploit code running on the user’s computer, a return\nconnection must be established from the victim network. If outbound filtering is implemented correctly,\nthe attacker will not receive this return connection and cannot control the exploited machine.\n\n**_3.3.1.1 Common Vulnerability: Access to Specific Ports on Host not Restricted to_**\n**_Required IP Addresses_**\n\nDetailed findings under this common vulnerability involve firewall rules restricting access to specific\nports, but not IP addresses. A common finding was that network device access control lists did not restrict\nmanagement access to the required IP addresses.\n\nAnother common detailed finding was that firewall rules allowed access to unused IP addresses. This\nwas because legacy configuration of the firewall allowed access to unused IP addresses. This provides an\nattack path by using this IP address in order to be allowed through the firewall.\n\nThe remaining specific assessment details associated with this vulnerability involved access to\nspecific ports being given to either an entire address space or were not restricted by IP address at all.\nAssessment findings that fall under this vulnerability are firewall rules that are based on address groups\nthat include a wider range than should be allowed.\n\nThe following are four specific assessment findings associated with this vulnerability:\n\n- Network device access control lists did not restrict management access to the required IP addresses\n\n- Unrestricted telnet access allowed to DMZ network equipment\n\n- Legacy configuration of firewall allows access to unused IP addresses\n\n- Access to resources specified in the firewall rules apply to entire corporate network.\n\n**Recommendations: Firewall rules that apply to functional groups should use defined finite groups that**\nare restricted to required IP addresses. Firewall rules that are no longer needed should be removed as part\nof a change management procedure or periodic system review or audit. Access control lists should be\nused to limit management access of network equipment to only those who need it.\n\n**_3.3.1.2 Common Vulnerability: Access not Restricted to Required One-way_**\n**_Communication Initiation_**\n\nDetailed findings under this common vulnerability involve firewall rules that do not restrict access\nbased on direction.\n\n\n-----\n\nTwo specific assessment findings associated with this vulnerability are:\n\n- Bi-directional rules allow connectivity to and from the control system DMZ for various control\nsystem protocols\n\n- Network equipment allowed to initiate connections to management servers.\n\n**Recommendation: Ensure that the communications paths require bi-directional communication. If not**\nrequired, modify each rule to only allow one-way communication initiation. For example, if devices such\nas networking hardware have no need to initiate sessions out of the DMZ, remove the configuration rules\nthat allow this.\n\n**_3.3.1.3 Mitigations for Firewall Filtering Deficiencies Category_**\n\nA well-configured firewall is critical to control system LAN security. Communications should be\nrestricted to only what is necessary for system functionality. System traffic should be monitored, and\nrules should be developed that allow only necessary access. Any exceptions created in the firewall rule set\nshould be as specific as possible, including host, protocol, and port information.\n\n##### 3.3.2 Vulnerability Category: Remote Access Deficiencies\n\nUnauthorized access may be gained through vulnerable or misconfigured services allowed into the\ncontrol system. Remote access paths can possibly provide access to control system components through\nexternal and internal networks.\n\n**_3.3.2.1 Common Vulnerability: Unauthorized Access Through VPN_**\n\nVirtual private network (VPN) access is commonly used for remote access into control systems for\nvendor maintenance access and possibly system administrator access.\n\nThe following are two specific assessment findings associated with this vulnerability:\n\n- Selective VPN access routes into the control system network were misconfigured\n\n- VPN concentrator was configured incorrectly.\n\n**Recommendations: Make sure VPN access is configured correctly and securely. When using a VPN, the**\nVPN concentrator should enforce the security policy instead of relying on the client to enforce security\nupon itself.\n\nThe remote end-point joins the trusted domain when it is allowed to remotely connect to the control\nsystem network. If VPN endpoints (hosts) are compromised, an attacker can utilize the VPN connection\nwhen it is established. Therefore, it is important that these hosts be secured as much as possible. [End-](http://www.computerweekly.com/Articles/2007/06/07/224586/set-strict-policies-for-mobile-workers-says-surfcontrol.htm)\n[point management software can be used to determine the security posture of the remote device and how it](http://www.computerweekly.com/Articles/2007/06/07/224586/set-strict-policies-for-mobile-workers-says-surfcontrol.htm)\nis allowed to connect to the protected network. VPN access should only be granted to the minimum set of\nhosts and users necessary.\n\n**_3.3.2.2 Common Vulnerability: Unauthorized Access Through Remote Display_**\n**_Applications_**\n\nRemote display applications (such as Remote desktop, Citrix, VNC, PC Call Anywhere,\nHummingbird, etc.) are commonly used for remote access into the control system from other networks.\nThis provides possible attack paths if these applications can be exploited.\n\nThe following are two specific assessment findings associated with this vulnerability:\n\n\n-----\n\n- Remote desktop passwords were common between security zones (corporate and control system\nnetworks)\n\n- It was possible to escalate privileges from a non-control system application remotely published by the\ndisplay application to a control system application.\n\n**Recommendations: Make sure remote display access is configured correctly and securely, and is kept**\npatched. Ensure access is limited to authorized personnel. Credentials for different security zones should\nbe different to prevent unauthorized access due to knowledge of authentication information in another\nzone. Remote display applications should not be relied on to “sandbox” a user into the display\napplication’s environment to prevent the user from accessing the underlying system.\n\n**_3.3.2.3 Mitigations for Remote Access Deficiencies_**\n\nIn order to gain remote access, an attacker must find a path through the perimeter defenses. This can\nbe done by piggybacking on a connection or exploiting a service allowed through the firewall. Therefore,\nall connections allowed in and out of the control system network(s) need to be configured securely and\nmonitored. Secure remote access services should be used and kept patched and current from\nvulnerabilities, which could allow an attacker to gather connection credentials or utilize the connection\nfor their own purposes.\n\nRemote access extends the attack surface to include the remote endpoints. If an attacker is able to\ncompromise a remote endpoint they can use the privileges of that endpoint to facilitate further attacks into\nthe critical network. Therefore the security of the endpoints is critical and needs to be maintained.\n\n##### 3.3.3 Vulnerability Category: Physical Access \n\nPhysical access vulnerability allows unauthorized physical access to critical assets. This includes\nphysical access to control system field devices that can be physically controlled or damaged, and physical\nconnection points into the data transfer paths of the control system such as Universal Serial Bus (USB),\nswitch, and other ports. Examples are devices located outside the protected area and any other path that\nallows unrestricted physical access to critical assets.\n\nA well-accepted rule of computer security is that once an attacker has acquired physical access to a\nmachine, it is generally trivial for that attacker to fully compromise the system. As technology improves,\nthis is becoming less of an issue, but for now, if an attacker has physical access to a machine, the attacker\ncan generally breach its security.\n\n**_3.3.3.1 Common Vulnerability: Physical Access to Network Equipment_**\n\nUnauthorized network access through physical access to network equipment includes the lack of\nphysical access control to the equipment. It also includes the lack of security configurations functions that\nlimit functionality even if physical access is obtained. The common finding was a lack of port security on\nnetwork equipment. A malicious user who has physical access to an unsecured port on a network switch\ncould plug into the network behind the firewall to defeat its incoming filtering protection.\n\nThe specific assessment finding was no port security on the network switch.\n\n**Recommendation: Port security should be implemented to limit connectivity to hardware interfaces.**\nGiven the static nature of control system environments, port security can be used to ensure Media Access\nControl (MAC) addresses do not change and new devices are not introduced to the network. Actions, such\nas limiting known MAC addresses to specific interfaces and disabling unused interfaces, should be\nimplemented to assist in network security. Given the static nature of the environment, port security can be\nused to ensure MAC addresses do not change and new devices are not introduced to the network.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_3.3.3.2 Mitigations for Physical Access Category_**\n\nFollow CIP-006-1, “Physical Security of Critical Cyber Assets.” Protect all critical cyber assets by\nisolating them in secured areas inside the physical security perimeter.\n\nPhysical access to an asset generally implies compromise. There are a number of simple steps a user\ncan take to mitigate the risk of attacks via physical access. The first and most important of these is to not\nallow physical access to a system by untrustworthy people. Additional security measures should also be\ntaken, which restrict access and damage potential once physical access is obtained (i.e., network port\nsecurity and strong authentication).\n\n##### 3.3.4 Access Security Dimension Summary\n\nThree categories with common vulnerabilities were identified in the access security dimension:\nfirewall filtering deficiencies, remote access, and physical access. Firewall filtering deficiencies allowed\naccess to ports on more IP addresses than necessary and did not restrict the direction the connections\ncould be initiated. Unauthorized remote access could be gained by taking advantage of VPN and remote\ndisplay communication paths. The lack of physical access protections allowed access to the control\nsystem network (see Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1. Frequency of access dimension common vulnerabilities by category.\n\n**_3.3.4.1 Summary of Recommendations for Access Security Dimension_**\n\nDisable or remove unused services. Documentation, traffic analysis, shutting off individual services,\nand other such methods can be used to identify the services necessary on each control system component.\nThis should be done by the control system vendor. After used services are identified, they should be\nanalyzed for necessity, especially if they are associated with known vulnerabilities. All necessary\ncommunication should be done using secure services that are kept patched and up-to-date to help prevent\nattackers from utilizing the allowed connection for their own purposes.\n\nUse a firewall to prevent access to ports and services that are unneeded or cannot be disabled or\nremoved. Firewall rules also need to restrict access to only the required IP addresses and the required\ncommunication directions. Change management procedures and periodic network reviews.\n\nDo not allow physical access to the critical assets. Additional security measures should also be taken\nto restrict access and damage potential once physical access is obtained.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### 3.4 Vulnerability Security Dimension\n\nThe vulnerability security dimension is that dimension that deals with weaknesses in the control\nsystem that allows an attacker to advance towards or accomplish malicious objectives. Vulnerabilities\nmay be software flaws or configuration mistakes.\n\nAfter an intruder has discovered enough information regarding the control system, he may be able to\nattack or manipulate it. In general, the easiest way for an intruder to control control system components is\nto send commands directly to the front-end equipment. Most front-end equipment, such as RTU,\nprogrammable logic controllers (PLCs), protocol converters, or FEPs lack even basic authentication. To\ncontrol such equipment, in most cases, an attacker need only establish a connection and issue a properly\nformatted command. The operator’s screen could possibly be exported back to the attacker as well, giving\nhim operator-level awareness and control of the process.\n\nAn attacker could also perform man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks on the control system protocols.\nOnce the attacker knows the protocol, he can modify the packets in transit. By inserting packets into the\nnetwork, he can issue arbitrary commands. By modifying replies, he can give the operator a false picture\nof the control system state. Thus, the attacker could both spoof and control the system.\n\nBecause control systems are not as prevalent as IT systems and have not been targeted by\nvulnerability discovery groups, and because of the nature of testing at the NSTB, many of the\nvulnerabilities documented in the assessment reports were discovered by the assessment team and are\ntherefore undisclosed, or zero day vulnerabilities.\n\n##### 3.4.1 Vulnerability Category: Lack of Input Validation\n\nInput validation is used to ensure that the content provided to an application does not grant an attacker\naccess to unintended functionality or privilege escalation. It is the result of programmer oversight.\n\n**_3.4.1.1 Common vulnerability: Buffer Overflow in Control System Service_**\n\nBuffer overflows result when a program tries to write more data into a buffer than the space it was\nallocated in memory. The “extra” data then overwrites adjacent memory, and ultimately results in\nabnormal operation of the program. A careful and successful memory overwrite can cause the program to\nbegin execution of arbitrary code provided by the attacker resulting in the system being remotely\ncontrolled.\n\nNetwork protocol implementations that do not check input strings for length put the system at risk for\nbuffer overflow exploits. The C and C++ programming languages are especially vulnerable, containing\nstring and memory function calls that can be used insecurely Other languages, such as Fortran, can also\nbe vulnerable.\n\nServices written by control system vendors frequently suffer from coding practices that allow\nattackers to supply unexpected data and thus modify program execution. Even though some control\nsystem protocols are commonly used, the services that receive and interpret are usually customized to the\nvendor product. Vulnerabilities in these services were a main target of many laboratory assessments\nbecause buffer overflows in the control system services are possible entry points onto the control system\nLAN (if the traffic is allowed).\n\nThe following are six specific assessment findings associated with this vulnerability:\n\n- Multiple assessments found buffer overflows in control system protocol implementations\n\n- Multiple assessments found buffer overflows in control system applications\n\n\n-----\n\n- Multiple assessments found buffer overflows in proprietary Distributed Network Protocol (DNP)\nimplementations\n\n- Buffer overflows were found in FEP programs\n\n- A buffer overflow was found in a proprietary real-time database\n\n- Buffer overflows were found in ICCP implementations.\n\n**Recommendation: All code should be written to validate input data. All programmers should be trained**\nin secure coding practices and all code should be reviewed and tested for input functions that could be\nsusceptible to buffer overflow attacks. All input should be validated, not just those proven to cause buffer\noverflows. Input should be validated for length, and buffer size should not be determined based on an\ninput value. This is especially important in the C and C++ programming languages, which contain string\nand memory function calls that can be used insecurely.\n\nEven if values are never input directly by a user, it cannot be assumed that data will always be\ncorrectly formatted or that hardware or operating system protections are sufficient. Most buffer overflows\nidentified in NSTB assessments were in the server applications that process control system protocol\ntraffic. In most cases, values input from network traffic were intercepted and altered in transit. Network\ndata bounds and integrity checking should therefore be implemented.\n\n**_3.4.1.2 Common vulnerability: Integer overflow in control system service_**\n\n[Integer overflows result when an arithmetic operation attempts to create a numeric value that is larger](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic)\nthan can be represented within the available storage space. For instance, adding 1 to the largest value that\ncan be represented constitutes an integer overflow. The most common result in these cases is for the value\nto “wrap” around to the lowest value possible. This can lead to unintended behavior if the value is\nassumed to be positive and wraps around to a negative value. Many other unexpected situations may\noccur from operations that create invalid values that are too small or large, including potential buffer\noverflows if the unexpectedly small number is used as the number of bytes to allocate for a buffer.\n\nControl system applications frequently suffer from coding practices that allow attackers to supply\nunexpected data and thus modify program execution. Even though control system applications pass valid\ndata values during normal operation, a common vulnerability discovery approach is to alter or input\nunexpected values.\n\nThe following is a specific finding associated with this vulnerability that was identified in multiple\nassessments:\n\n- Integer overflow found in control system protocol.\n\n**Recommendation: All code should be written to validate input data. All programmers should be trained**\nin secure coding practices and all code should be reviewed and tested for input functions that could be\nsusceptible to buffer overflow attacks. All input should be validated, not just those proven to cause buffer\noverflows. Input values should be validated.\n\nEven if values are never input directly by a user, it cannot be assumed that data will always be\ncorrectly formatted or that hardware or operating system protections are sufficient. It is possible for\ncontrol system traffic to be intercepted and altered in transit. Network data value and integrity checking\nshould therefore be implemented.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_3.4.1.3 Common Vulnerability: Lack of Bounds Checking in Control System Service_**\n\nThe lack of input validation for values that are expected to be in a certain range, such as array index\nvalues, can cause unexpected behavior. For instance, if input is not validated, negative or too large\nnumbers can be input for array access and cause essential services to crash.\n\nControl system applications frequently suffer from coding practices that allow attackers to supply\nunexpected data and thus modify program execution. Even though control system applications pass valid\ndata values during normal operation, a common vulnerability discovery approach is to alter or input\nunexpected values.\n\nThe following are specific assessment findings associated with this vulnerability:\n\n- Crashed control system communications service by altering input value to negative number\n\n- Lack of validation of number of points sent resulted in denial-of-service (DoS)\n\n- DoS caused by out of range index values.\n\n**Recommendation: All code should be written to validate input data. All programmers should be trained**\nin secure coding practices and all code should be reviewed and tested for input functions that could be\nsusceptible to buffer overflow attacks. All input should be validated, not just those proven to cause buffer\noverflows. Input values should be validated.\n\nEven if values are never input directly by a user, it cannot be assumed that data will always be\ncorrectly formatted or that hardware or operating system protections are sufficient. It is possible for\ncontrol system traffic to be intercepted and altered in transit. Network data value and integrity checking\nshould therefore be implemented.\n\n**_3.4.1.4 Common Vulnerability: SQL Injection Vulnerability_**\n\nStructured Query Language (SQL) injection vulnerabilities were identified in multiple assessments\nbecause control systems use real-time databases, configuration databases, and multiple historian databases\nin different security zones. Compromise of any of these databases may provide valuable information and\nthe opportunity to insert or corrupt data, as well as control of the database server.\n\nSQL injections were found by looking at the source code of applications and by trial and error. SQL\ninjections typically occur when the developer is creating an SQL query that includes data provided from a\nuser and does not filter escape sequences.\n\nThe following are three specific assessment findings associated with this vulnerability:\n\n- Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities found for control system commercial database\n\n- Shell commands invoked through SQL queries on DMZ historian server\n\n- Non-parameterized SQL statements are contained in some of the back-end Java coding; this may be\nsusceptible to second order SQL injections.\n\n**Recommendation: Fix the vulnerable method of building SQL queries from non-validated user input by**\neither adding filters to check user input and properly escaping any character that might lead to an SQL\ninjection or switching to prepared SQL query statements. With prepared statements, the SQL query is\ncompiled with placeholders and those placeholders are later filled with the data provided by the user.\nSince the SQL statement has already been compiled, it is not possible to perform an SQL injection.\n\nCare still has to be taken to make sure there are no SQL injections within procedures and functions\ndefined on the database. The prepared statements only prevent SQL injections from the user interface\n\n\n-----\n\n(usually a Web application), and will have no effect in preventing SQL injections that might exist in\nfunctions and procedures defined within the database. Use parameterized SQL statements throughout the\ncode.\n\nTry to minimize the damage an attacker can do with an SQL injection by only granting access to the\nminimum number of resources that the Web application needs to operate. For example, if the Web\napplication is only displaying data, revoke all write privileges from that Web application. It is also a good\nidea to have separate accounts for running versus developing the Web applications. This removes the\nability to create tables and functions from the runtime user.\n\n**_3.4.1.5 Mitigations for Lack of Input Validation Category_**\n\nVendors and asset owners who write custom applications should train developers in secure coding\npractices. All custom software should undergo thorough code review via both manual and automated\nprocesses to identify security issues while the code is still in the development stage. Control systemspecific protocols should be redesigned to include strong authentication and integrity checks. IT products\ndeployed on the control system network should also have passed a security review. Asset owners should\nexplicitly address the security of these products during the procurement process.\n\n##### 3.4.2 Vulnerability Category: Vulnerable Communication Protocols\n\nServices that employ weak authentication methods can be exploited to gain unauthorized privilege.\nPoorly protected credentials can be found in documentation or code, sniffed “off the wire,” cracked, or\nguessed.\n\n**_3.4.2.1 Common Vulnerability: Standard IT Protocol Uses Weak Encryption_**\n\nSome standard IT encryption protocols used in assessment systems were exploited due to encryption\nweaknesses. A published attack was used in multiple assessments to crack a terminal service encryption\nand view the user credentials during authentication.\n\nThe following is a common specific assessment finding associated with this vulnerability:\n\n- Remote desktop encryption can be cracked.\n\n**Recommendation: Perform the necessary background research before choosing and properly**\nimplementing an encryption solution. Keep informed on published vulnerabilities and weaknesses of the\ndeployed protocols and keep patches up-to-date.\n\n**_3.4.2.2 Common vulnerability: Standard IT Protocol Uses Clear Text Authentication_**\n\nClear text authentication credentials can be sniffed and used by an attacker to authenticate to the\nsystem.\n\nThe following are two sanitized findings associated with this vulnerability from multiple assessments:\n\n- Standard IT clear text authentication protocols are used by the control system\n\n- Standard IT clear text authentication protocol services are running on multiple control system hosts.\n\n**Recommendation: Reduce the number of necessary services as much as possible. If necessary services**\nare vulnerable to attack, these services should be replaced with more secure counterparts. For example,\nthe clear text protocols FTP, telnet, rshell, rexec, and rlogin can be replaced with SSH and secure FTP.\nThis is straightforward for system access. This effort is not trivial if these services are integrated into the\n\n\n-----\n\nsystem functionality, and may require rewriting code, architecting secure authentication, or even\nreengineering system communications.\n\n**_3.4.2.3 Common Vulnerability: Control Ssystem Protocol Uses Weak Authentication_**\n\nCommands from the Human-Machine Interface (HMI) cause actions in the control system. Alarms\nare sent to the HMI that notify operators of triggered events. The integrity and timely delivery of alarms\nand commands is critical in a control system.\n\nWeak authentication in control system protocols allows replay or spoof attacks to send unauthorized\nmessages. This means it is possible to send messages that update the HMI or RTU. The attacker may be\nable to cause invalid data to be displayed on a console or create invalid commands or alarm messages.\n\nThe following specific assessment findings associated with this vulnerability were identified on\nmultiple assessments:\n\n- Common control system protocol uses weak authentication between control system and field\nequipment (RTU)\n\n- Proprietary control system protocol uses weak authentication between control system components.\n\n**Recommendation: The system** design needs to implement strong authentication into control system\ncommunication protocols and encrypt communications if possible.\n\n**_3.4.2.4 Common Vulnerability: Control System Protocol Uses Weak Integrity Checks_**\n\nThe lack of, or weak, data integrity checks prevent a protocol from detecting bad data. An attacker is\nable to manipulate alarm or command messages sent over the wire if the control system protocol has poor\nintegrity checks. This has the same effect as above, where the attacker may be able to cause invalid data\nto be displayed on a console or create invalid command or alarm messages.\n\nIf an attacker has access to control system communication paths and reverse engineered the control\nsystem network communications protocol, it is possible to manipulate the data flowing between the\nsystem components. This includes commands and messages sent to update operator screens and control\nfield equipment. Altering the operator’s view of the system received from the control system can be used\nto either trick the operator into performing actions the attacker wants, or to hide what an attacker is doing\nwith the system.\n\nThe following specific assessment findings associated with this vulnerability were identified on\nmultiple assessments:\n\n- MITM altering of control system communication possible between control system and field\nequipment (RTU)\n\n- MITM altering of control system communication possible between control system components.\n\n**Recommendation: Data integrity checks need to be designed and implemented in control system**\ncommunication protocols. Use hardcoded Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) tables for static IP\naddresses or dynamic ARP inspection of dynamic IP addresses, if feasible. Monitoring the network traffic\nfor changing MAC addresses using an IDS, such as ARPWatch, can help detect MITM attacks. Using\nport security on all network equipment is another good practice, which helps protect against unauthorized\nphysical connections into the network.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_3.4.2.5 Mitigations for vulnerable communications protocols_**\n\nControl system vendors should implement secure-by-default settings for their control system\nproducts. These should include protocols that use strong encryption schemes for message authentication.\ncontrol system-specific protocols should be redesigned to include strong authentication and integrity\nchecks. During control system configuration, vendors, owner/operators, and integrators should pay\nspecial attention to end-point security, including proper storage of encryption keys, signing of digital\ncertificates, and enablement of security settings.\n\n##### 3.4.3 Vulnerability Category: Weak User Authentication\n\nEven if a protocol provides for strong authentication, it must be implemented correctly with strong\npasswords that are kept private. Users are responsible for creating and protecting authentication\ncredentials.\n\n**_3.4.3.1 Common Vulnerability: Improper Security Configuration_**\n\nA common problem found during assessments was that even though secure authentication\napplications were used, installations and configurations were not correct.\n\nThe following are five specific assessment findings associated with this vulnerability:\n\n- Unsecure SSH implementation\n\n- Access authentication for password management, accounting, and accessibility not implemented on\nfirewall\n\n- Login information remembered\n\n- Network device authentication encryption can be broken. (Stronger encryption could have been\nchosen.)\n\n- X11 implementation provides weak authentication.\n\n**Recommendation: Instructions for secure installation and proper configuration for each application need**\nto be followed and tested. Do not allow login information to be stored so that re-authentication on that\ncomputer is never required again, or hard coded into scripts and user programs.\n\n**_3.4.3.2 Common Vulnerability: No Password Required_**\n\nSome assessments discovered applications that had been configured without passwords.\n\nThe following are three specific assessment findings associated with this vulnerability:\n\n- No authentication required between corporate clients and Web server on DMZ\n\n- The Oracle listener was configured without a password on multiple assessments\n\n- Network equipment required no Virtual Trunking Protocol (VTP) domain password.\n\n**Recommendation: Strong passwords need to be required and deployed on networking, client, and server**\nequipment.\n\n**_3.4.3.3 Common Vulnerability: Weak Passwords_**\n\nThe longer and more complex a password is, the longer it will take for it to be guessed or cracked.\nCracking a password can be trivial or virtually impossible depending on the combination of different\ncharacter types used and password length.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe following are two specific assessment findings associated with this vulnerability:\n\n- Weak passwords were cracked\n\n- Common administrative account passwords were used between LANs.\n\n**Recommendation: A policy** mandating the use of strong passwords for all cyber assets inside the\nelectronic perimeter with a reasonable lifespan limit needs to be mandated and enforced. Usage of\ncommon administrative passwords needs to be discouraged.\n\n**_3.4.3.4 Mitigations for Weak User Authentication Category_**\n\nMitigations for this vulnerability category include requiring login for all system management\nfunctions, enabling software features to require strong passwords, and implementing multi-factor\nauthentication.\n\n##### 3.4.4 Vulnerability Category: Least Privileges Not Enforced\n\nThe least privileges policy grants privileges to a user only for necessary functions. Not every user of a\ncomputer requires administrative privileges with access to all files and folders. For further information\nsee National Institute of Technology’s (NIST’s), “Recommended Security Controls for Federal\nInformation Systems,” SP800-53, which organizes security controls into families for ease of use.\n\nAssessment findings show how access to files and applications was possible, even though it was not\nwithin the given process or user’s need or permission.\n\n**_3.4.4.1 Common Vulnerability: Unauthorized Directory Traversal Allowed_**\n\nFindings were reported that directory traversal was allowed beyond intended file access. This was\naccomplished through either remotely connecting to the Web server or using a file transfer protocol.\n\nThe following are specific assessment findings associated with this vulnerability:\n\n- Web server allowed directory browsing\n\n- Web server allowed file traversal using “..” string for higher directories\n\n- File transfer protocol permissions allowed directory traversal.\n\n**Recommendation: The file permissions on the Web server need to be set granting the least privileges**\nnecessary. The system design needs to be evaluated to reduce necessary file access as much as possible.\nFeatures on the Web server, such as unrestricted browsing, need to be disabled and additional security of\nHTTP can be gained by utilizing the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) where possible. Filter input to screen\nincoming filenames to exclude the “..” string. Disabling unused ports and keeping the Web server patched\nto current standards are also good practices. Write permissions are most dangerous, but read permissions\nmay disclose valuable information or information that can be used for attack.\n\n**_3.4.4.2 Common vulnerability: Services running with unnecessary privileges_**\n\nServices are restricted to the user rights granted through the user account associated with them.\nExploitation of any service could allow an attacker a foothold on the control system network with the\nexploited service’s permissions. Privilege escalation can be accomplished by exploiting a vulnerable\nservice running with more privileges than the attacker has currently obtained. If successfully exploited,\nservices running as a privileged user would allow full access to the exploited host.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis vulnerability was very common. The following are some specific assessment findings associated\nwith this vulnerability:\n\n- Many SQL connections were running with full admin rights\n\n- Many common remote access services were running as root or administrator\n\n- Web application executed scripts with root privileges, which could allow local users in that group to\nexecute arbitrary commands as root by modifying the scripts\n\n- Control system console application required administrative access to the system\n\n- A backup service was running as administrator\n\n- Remote exploitation of control system application services allowed root-level access on control\nsystem hosts.\n\n**Recommendation: By default, some control system installations start services as the root user and root**\ngroup. Many services do not need to be started with this much privilege, and doing so exposes system\nresources to preventable risks. By restricting necessary privileges during control system design and\nimplementation, the window of exposure and criticality of impact is significantly reduced in the event that\na flaw is found in that service. Essentially, running with minimum privileges is a recommended practice\nbecause it reduces the potential harm that a service can cause if it were to misbehave due to a bug,\naccident, or malicious exploit.\n\nThe most secure service available should be used for a given functionality, and then kept patched and\nup-to-date to help prevent exploitation.\n\n**_3.4.4.3 Common vulnerability: Control system protocols with unnecessary functionality_**\n\nSome control system protocols could be exploited to perform unintended actions. In this case,\nprotocols were designed for functionality without restricting unauthorized actions.\n\nThe following are specific assessment findings associated with this vulnerability:\n\n- HMI was able to insert arbitrary alarms into the alarm database\n\n- Historian was able to insert data into the real time database\n\n- All control system hosts were able to modify the real-time database.\n\n**Recommendation: control system protocols and/or applications need to be redesigned to only include**\nintended functionality and rights.\n\n**_3.4.4.4 Mitigations for Least Privileges not Enforced Category_**\n\nThe principle of least privilege recommends that accounts have the least amount of privilege required\nto perform business processes. This encompasses user rights, resource permissions such as CPU limits,\nmemory, network, and file system permissions.\n\nA common problem is applications and services running with system or root-level privileges. If this is\nthe case, and an attacker is able to exploit the application, the exploit code will run with system\nprivileges. A number of software products run with these super user permissions by default, and yet will\nstill function properly if running as a less-privileged user.\n\nAnother common problem is allowing users to operate computer systems (consoles, servers, etc.) with\nmore permissions than necessary. For example, if the operator only needs access to the HMI, he should\nonly have permission for that application. Under no circumstances should the operator be granted\n\n\n-----\n\nadministrative privileges. User accounts used for interactive logon should be carefully evaluated for the\nproper set of permissions.\n\nA related issue is file permissions. File shares should be restricted to only those users who require\naccess and limited to the access level they require. For example, if control system information is shared to\neveryone on the network, even if the control system network is segmented, an intruder gaining access to\nthe control system network will have access to all control system-specific information. Restrict necessary\ncommunications and lower permission levels of users and applications to allowable functions. Share files\nonly to required computers and user accounts. Give each user and process the minimal privileges\nnecessary for system operation.\n\n##### 3.4.5 Vulnerability Category: Unpatched Systems\n\nA computer system is vulnerable to attack from the time a vulnerability is discovered and publicly\ndisclosed, to when a patch is generated, disseminated, and finally applied. The number of publicly\nannounced vulnerabilities has been steadily increasing over the past decade to the point where patch\nmanagement is a necessary part of maintaining a computer system. Although patching may be difficult in\nhigh-availability environments, unpatched systems are often trivial to exploit due to the ease of\nrecognizing product version and the readiness of exploit code.\n\n**_3.4.5.1 Common Vulnerability: Unpatched Operating System_**\n\nUnpatched operating systems open control systems to attack through known operating system service\nvulnerabilities. For example, in 2003 the Slammer worm disabled an Ohio Davis-Besse nuclear power\nplant safety monitoring system for nearly 5 hours. The Davis-Besse plant was in a maintenance cycle at\nthis time and not generating power. According to reports, plant computer engineers had not installed the\npatch for the Microsoft (MS)-SQL vulnerability that Slammer exploited. In fact, they did not know there\nwas a patch, which Microsoft released 6 months before Slammer struck. See\n[http://www.securityfocus.com/news/6767.](http://www.securityfocus.com/news/6767)\n\nThe following are two sanitized findings associated with this vulnerability from multiple assessments:\n\n- Operating system vendor patches were not applied\n\n- System computers vulnerable to operating system service vulnerability.\n\n**Recommendation: A timely patch management process is critical to reduce vulnerabilities. This process**\nrequires elements of IT, IT security, process control engineering, and senior management. It needs to\nincorporate elements of an Incident Response Plan, a Disaster Recovery Plan, testbed testing, and a\nConfiguration Management Plan. Where patching is not an option, work arounds and defense in depth\ntechniques and tactics can be used.\n\n**_3.4.5.2 Common Vulnerability: Unpatched Third-party Applications_**\n\nIn multiple assessments, unpatched or old versions of applications were built into the control systems.\nSome had newer versions available just for security fixes. These applications possess vulnerabilities that\nmay provide an attack path into the system. As with the unpatched operating system vulnerabilities, the\nsoftware is well known and available exploit code makes them an easy target.\n\nThe following are six assessment findings examples associated with this vulnerability:\n\n- Unpatched and vulnerable Web server\n\n- Unpatched and vulnerable database\n\n\n-----\n\n- Buffer overflow in unpatched Oracle database\n\n- Unpatched ICCP stacks\n\n- Unpatched SSL libraries\n\n- Unpatched XML libraries.\n\n**Recommendation: A timely patch management process is critical to reduce vulnerabilities. This process**\nrequires elements of IT, IT security, process control engineering and senior management. In-depth test\nbed testing of issued patches is important to identify adverse affects they may have on the control system\nbefore deploying patches on operational systems. Where patching is not an option, work arounds and\ndefense in-depth techniques and tactics can be used. Statically linked libraries need to be independently\nkept up-to-date if they are different from the libraries associated with the operating system.\n\n**_3.4.5.3 Mitigations for Unpatched Systems Category_**\n\nUnpatched systems, including operating systems, control system software, and other applications, are\noften found in control system environments. Locating such systems is often achieved by a simple\nvulnerability scan. Systems may go unpatched due to high availability operational requirements and the\nchallenges associated with extensive patch testing and multiple deployment locations.\n\nAsset owners should monitor sources of vulnerability information for applicability to their\nenvironment. The asset owner should couple the vulnerability information feed with the configuration\nmanagement process to identify the resources that are potentially affected by the vulnerabilities. The asset\nowner should have a risk management paradigm established to guide the decision of whether and when a\npatch should be deployed. The asset owner should have established a patch management methodology\nthat includes thorough patch testing prior to deployment. The asset owner should have a deployment\nmethodology that results in minimal down time and patches systems via predetermined priority ranking.\n\nIT software is often included in vendor control systems. Vendors should use due diligence to ensure\nthat the products they incorporate were written under a development process that emphasized security\nfrom the beginning of the development lifecycle. Vendors should ensure that IT products are at current\nversion and patch levels prior to deployment at asset owner sites and support timely testing of patches for\ncustomers.\n\nAsset owners should institute a rigorous change and patch management paradigm to identify patch\nreleases and apply them in as timely a manner as possible. The decision of patch timeliness should be\nbased on a sound understanding of risk and the threat environment, taking into consideration the\nsimplicity, exposure, and impact of an attacker exploiting the unpatched vulnerability.\n\n##### 3.4.6 Vulnerability Security Dimension Summary\n\nFive categories with common vulnerabilities were identified in the vulnerability dimension. The lack\nof input validation led to buffer overflows, integer overflows, out of bounds conditions, and SQL\ninjection vulnerabilities in control system services. IT and control system communication protocols\nprovided weak or no encryption or integrity checks. Weak user authentication was caused by improper\nsecurity configurations, weak passwords, and the lack of required passwords. The lack of least privilege\nrestrictions led to unauthorized directory traversal and services running as privileged users.\nVulnerabilities were also found due to unpatched operating systems and third-party applications (see\nFigure 2).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2. Frequency of vulnerability security dimension common vulnerabilities by category.\n\n**_3.4.6.1 Summary of Recommendations for Vulnerability Security Dimension_**\n\nAsset owners must use procurement specifications to ensure that security development lifecycle\nrequirements are met by the vendor. Asset owners may also hire independent security assessment teams to\nreview demonstration vendor products for security issues prior to purchase. Vulnerability and patch\nmanagement programs and policies must be established and enforced. Firewalls, intrusion detection\nsystems, and antivirus solutions should be deployed and properly configured at all appropriate locations.\nAsset owners must identify and deploy security workarounds, defense in depth strategies and utilize\nmonitoring (i.e., access logs and intrusion detection systems) to mitigate risk introduced by the presence\nof unpatched vulnerabilities until patches can be properly tested and deployed.\n\nVendors need to incorporate security into every phase of the product development life cycle and rely\non manual and automated means to ensure proper bounds checking. Once products are deployed, vendors\nneed to establish a process to manage and mitigate product security defects. The vendor team should\nconsist of representatives of key business functions, such as product development, public relations, and\nlegal. A single point of contact leads resolution on reported security issues and must assist asset owners in\naddressing reported security issues in a timely manner. Common industry practice is to host a “/security”\nWeb page off the corporate main domain where information on security issues and the designated contact\nor team can easily be found. The vendor is responsible for responding to reported security concerns that\ninclude issue validation, patch development, patch testing and validation, and response coordination.\n\n#### 3.5 Damage Potential Security Dimension\n\nDamage potential is the amount of loss that a malicious attacker has the power to cause once they\nhave compromised the control system. The amount of damage that can be caused by a compromised\ncontrol system is determined by the type of process that it controls and by the nature of engineered safety\nsystems (e.g., physical safety mechanisms, redundant systems, and defense in depth measures may be in\nplace preventing significant damage despite successful attack on the electronic control system).\n\nFor onsite assessments this estimate is feasible and may be based on a worse-case loss estimate or an\nexisting safety risk analysis. For laboratory assessments there is no field-scale physical process that is\nbeing controlled, so the damage potential must be evaluated differently, perhaps by noting whether there\nis an independent safety system associated with the rest of the system.\n\nFor assessments in general the safety system should be evaluated from a security perspective. To date,\nthorough investigations of the electronic safety mechanisms, independence of the safety instrumented\n\n\n-----\n\nsystems, and ease of safety system compromise have not occurred on the NSTB program. Consequently,\nthere are no common vulnerabilities to report at this time.\n\n#### 3.6 Detection Security Dimension\n\nIntrusion detection is the act of detecting actions that attempt to compromise the confidentiality,\nintegrity, or availability of a resource. Intrusion detection does not include prevention of intrusions.\nIntrusion detection can be performed manually or automatically. Manual intrusion detection is done by\nexamining log files or other evidence for signs of intrusions, including off normal network traffic.\nAutomated approaches use intrusion detection systems to monitor system logs, network traffic flow, and\npackets. When a “probable intrusion” is identified, an alert is sent. Determining what the probable\nintrusion actually is and taking some form of action to stop it or prevent it from happening is outside the\nscope of intrusion detection systems. Intrusion prevention systems are not generally recommended along\npaths of critical functionality.\n\nIntrusion detection was not a focus for laboratory assessments, but in many cases it was noted\nwhether the system gave any indication of abnormal conditions, such as alerts on the operator screen.\nThere was a general lack of adequate control system indicators of abnormal conditions. Onsite\nassessments also found intrusion detection systems to be lacking in their installation, monitoring, and/or\nupdating. Better indicators of abnormal system traffic and behavior should be built into operator screens.\nIDS systems should be deployed, tailored to the control system architecture and traffic, and continuously\nmonitored. Control system networks are generally static in nature and IDS rules can therefore be\ndeveloped to look for abnormal behavior such as a protocol that should not be used between two\ncomputers.\n\n#### 3.7 Recovery Security Dimension\n\nRecovery is associated with the ability to restore the control system from a compromised state to an\nuncompromised state. It is dependent on the reliability and security of both the backup and the restore\nprocesses and mechanisms. To date, NSTB assessments have not thoroughly assessed the security and\npotential vulnerabilities in these processes and mechanisms, so there are no common vulnerabilities to\nnote at this time.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### 4. SUMMARY\n\nThe U.S. DOE established the NSTB Program to help industry and government improve the security\nof the control systems used in the nation’s critical energy infrastructures. A key part of the program is the\nassessment of control systems to identify vulnerabilities that could put the systems at risk from a cyber\nattack. Assessments were performed in the INL SCADA Test Bed and in operational control system\ninstallations.\n\nLaboratory assessments were designed to test vendor-specific products and services such as custom\nprotocols, field equipment, applications, and services. Onsite system assessments generally assessed how\nsecurely external connections, firewall configurations, IDS, network architecture, and other components\nare deployed and installed.\n\nIn order to help prevent disclosure of vulnerabilities that may not have been patched, assessment\nagreements with control system vendors and owners include some form of non-disclosure agreements that\ngive the vendors and owners the right to control dissemination of assessment findings. Some of the\nvendors have been forthright in sharing the results with their customers, and some have felt that any\ndisclosure of vulnerabilities could lead to unnecessary exposure of their customers to potential cyber\nattacks. Whether results were shared with control system customers, security awareness has been\nincreased by sharing general control system security knowledge, which was gained through the\nassessment process. Cyber security and control system researchers have presented results and provided\nsecurity training to attendees of the various vendor user group conferences. Many user groups have now\nestablished breakout sessions dedicated wholly to control system cyber security issues. Some of these\nbreakout sessions have evolved into user consortiums that work together to fund additional testing on the\ncontrol systems they use.\n\nThis common control system vulnerability report provides another avenue for sharing the control\nsystem security knowledge gained through the NSTB program. After searching for standard vulnerability\ncategorization methods to present the common assessment findings, the INL control system cyber security\ntechnical metrics taxonomy was selected as the best fit. Seven control system security dimensions were\ndivided into subcategories of findings identified in order to support security analysis at multiple levels of\ngranularity. Detailed vulnerability descriptions were then generalized to remove system identifying\ninformation and to aid in creation of common vulnerability categories. Some sanitized individual\nvulnerability details were included in the vulnerability discussions in this report to promote better\nunderstanding of the findings. Vulnerabilities were considered common when at least two assessments\nhad findings that could be generally described as the same vulnerability.\n\nThe common vulnerabilities in Table 2 indicate that control systems often integrate third-party\napplications and services with known vulnerabilities as well as integrating clear text and weak\nauthentication communication protocols into their functionality. Other vulnerabilities are built into these\nsystems because of unsecure custom software design, implementation, and coding practices.\n\nOnsite assessment findings indicated that control system administrators need to be more diligent in\nverifying and documenting their current system configuration. They must also more effectively determine\nthe required communication paths based on IP address, port number, and direction, secure the\ncommunications protocols to the extent possible, and then block all other communications. Intrusion\ndetection and antivirus applications can then be used to help detect attacks.\n\nControl system vendors and owners can learn and apply many common computer security concepts\nand practices to secure and protect their systems. Security should be designed and implemented by\nqualified security and control system experts who are able to verify that the solutions are effective and\ncan make sure that the solutions do not impair the system’s reliability and timing requirements. Given the\n\n\n-----\n\nnature of the vulnerabilities found in control systems, asset owners cannot always directly fix them. Thus,\nas they wait for vendor patches and fixes, the asset owners should design and implement defense in depth\nsecurity strategies that aid in protecting the control system from attack.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### 5.

There is\nno generally accepted taxonomy for control system security assessments. Several published taxonomies\nwere considered, but they were not chosen for this report because they did not provide a good fit to the\nINL assessment paradigm. For example, the Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability (CIA) McCumber\nCube model[2] is a well-known framework for information security evaluation, but it is a high-level\nclassification of what is protected rather than a taxonomy of assessment findings and is not oriented to\ncontrol systems. Other taxonomies considered were the Sandia National Laboratory (SNL) Reference\nModel,[3] Mitre Common Weaknesses Enumeration (CWE),[4] National Institutes of Technology (NIST) and\nNational Security Agency (NSA) Information Security (INFOSEC) Assessment Methodology (IAM),[5]\nand Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) structured vulnerability classification.[6]\n\n#### A-1. Security Dimension Taxonomy\n\nThe INL taxonomy was used to categorize each finding first at a primary level, then at a secondary\nlevel of granularity. The top level of the taxonomy is one of seven abstract dimensions of security. These\nseven security dimensions are the basis of control system cyber security technical metrics proposed by\nMcQueen et al.[7] These seven security dimensions represent the main system attributes that affect the risk\nof loss from cyber attacks. Every item of interest (i.e., finding, vulnerability, weakness, concern, or\nobservation) identified in the collection of reviewed assessment reports mapped to at least one of the\nseven dimensions of security. However, vulnerabilities were not found in all security dimensions due to\nthe focus of assessments. And assessments did not analyze damage potential and recovery ability.\n\nThese security dimensions were further subdivided by the categories of findings identified in order to\nsupport analysis at multiple levels of granularity. The categories were influenced by the assessment\nfindings, and are expected to be modified and extended as more assessments are completed.\n\nVulnerability descriptions were generalized to remove specific vendor-identifying information and\ndetails that would hinder the ability to group common vulnerabilities. Sanitized individual details are\nreferenced in the vulnerability discussion in this report to promote understanding of the findings. A\nfinding is defined as a minimum of two assessments having the same vulnerability.\n\n#### A-2. Security Dimension Definitions\n\n A-2.1 Security Group Knowledge\n\nThe security group knowledge ideal is defined as aspects of the system or associated management\nprocesses that impact the ability of the security group to know the system and manage changes to the\nsystem. It includes aspects of the system and processes associated with configuration management, tools\n(or lack of tools) that support the tracking of changes, and the collection and analysis of system logs and\nforensics. Ideally, the security group has perfect knowledge of the control system.\n\n#### A-2.2 Attack Group Knowledge\n\nThe Attack Group Knowledge dimension of security is the set of system attributes, processes, or\nactions that provide potential attackers with means to gain information about the system. It includes\n\n\n-----\n\nsoftware defects or configuration settings that return information when the system is probed by an\nunauthenticated user, any information about the system that can be obtained from public sources, and\ndesign or implementation weaknesses that allow a user with no authenticated privilege to gain\ninformation by listening on communication paths. Ideally, potential attackers have zero knowledge about\nthe control system.\n\n#### A-2.3 Access\n\nAccess is the dimension of security that provides a potential attacker with the ability to send or\nreceive data to/from a component of the control system from the attacker’s location. This includes\nphysical access to control system components, access to control system components through external and\ninternal networks, and access from internal components that may have been compromised. Since there is\nalways the possibility of unknown “zero day” vulnerabilities existing for a component, access does not\naddress whether or not the communication channel is known to provide useful information, nor whether\nattacking it will provide the attacker with any particular desired result. Ideally, there are no data pathways\nbetween the control system and the location of potential attackers.\n\n#### A-2.4 Vulnerabilities\n\nA vulnerability is any defect or weaknesses in the control system that can be exploited to gain\nunauthorized privilege or compromise its operation. This includes, but is not limited to, known\nvulnerabilities, the ability to identify previously unknown vulnerabilities, and estimates of the number of\nzero day vulnerabilities in the system. This dimension of security excludes defects that allow information\nto be obtained once access is gained without also explicitly gaining privilege. If a single defect allows an\nattacker to gain information and also gain privilege, that defect is defined as a vulnerability. Ideally there\nare no defects in design or implementation that potential attackers can exploit to gain unauthorized\nprivilege. Note that for an attacker to gain unauthorized privilege and compromise control system\noperations, all three of the following conditions must be present: attacker knowledge, access, and\nvulnerability.\n\n#### A-2.5 Damage Potential\n\nThe damage potential is defined as the amount of loss that a malicious attacker has the power to cause\nonce they have gained privilege on a control system. It does not include any weaknesses associated with\nthe process of gaining malicious control. Although actual damage may be reduced by a quick response to\nan attack, this dimension does not include any effects associated with attack detection or control system\nrecovery. Ideally, there are mechanisms independent of the control system, which prevent damage to the\nplant even if the control system is fully compromised.\n\n#### A-2.6 Detection\n\nDetection is the dimension of security that is associated with the ability to detect attacks and provide\ntimely notification. This includes anti-virus software, intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention\nsystems, system logging, installation or implementation of detection mechanisms, and the effectiveness of\nthose mechanisms. Ideally, any attack is detected instantly and the Security Group is notified immediately\nof the detection.\n\n#### A-2.7 Recovery\n\nRecovery is the dimension of security associated with the ability to restore the control system from a\ncompromised state to an uncompromised state. It includes the reliability of both the backup and the\n\n\n-----\n\nrestore facilities and the time required to recover from an attack. Ideally, a compromised control system\ncan be instantly restored to an uncompromised state.\n\n#### A-2.8 Categories\n\nThe security dimensions were subdivided into categories of findings (see Table A-1). The categories\nwere influenced by the assessment findings; thus, they are expected to be modified and extended as more\nassessments are completed.\n\nTable A-1. Control system cyber security taxonomy used to classify NSTB assessment findings.\n\nSecurity Dimension Category\n\n_Security Group (SG)_ Change management deficiency (Legacy configurations not removed)\n_Knowledge_\n\nDocumentation deficiency (operation and maintenance requirements,\ntraining requirements, audit requirements, backup requirements, Roles &\nResponsibilities, etc.)\n\nProcedure deficiency (lack of standard/documented procedures)\n_Attack Group (AG)_ Information leaks, enumeration (e.g., clear text communications)\n_Knowledge_\nOpen source information available to attackers\n_Access_ Firewall filtering deficiency\nRemote access deficiencies\n\nPhysical access to data transfer paths (e.g., unrestricted USB ports,\ndevices outside protected area)\n_Vulnerability_ Lack of input validation\nCommunication protocols with weak or no authentication\n\nWeak user authentication\nLeast privileges not enforced\nUnpatched systems\n_Damage Potential_ Lack of safety system\n\nSafety system not independent of control system\n_Detection_ Host detection mechanism deficiency\nNetwork detection mechanism deficiency\n\nLack of anti-virus software\n_Recovery_ Excessive recovery time\n\nLack of ability to recover\n\n#### A-3. Identification of Recommended Mitigations\n\nReported assessment findings were extracted, combined, and categorized as described above, and\nwere given corresponding recommendations and/or mitigations. These recommendations and/or\nmitigations are based upon those indicated in the assessment reports. The mitigations are general in\nnature, with the intent of being applicable to findings identified in multiple assessments. As such, they are\nhigh-level generic recommendations and require further refinement before implementation on any\nspecific system. Most of the assessments to date only evaluated the control system software. Therefore, a\nmajority of the recommendations require vendor development, not just a configuration change that can be\ndone by the end users. Based on typical maintenance agreements, changes may have to be approved by\n\n|Security Dimension|Category|\n|---|---|\n|Security Group (SG) Knowledge|Change management deficiency (Legacy configurations not removed)|\n||Documentation deficiency (operation and maintenance requirements, training requirements, audit requirements, backup requirements, Roles & Responsibilities, etc.)|\n||Procedure deficiency (lack of standard/documented procedures)|\n|Attack Group (AG) Knowledge|Information leaks, enumeration (e.g., clear text communications)|\n||Open source information available to attackers|\n|Access|Firewall filtering deficiency|\n||Remote access deficiencies|\n||Physical access to data transfer paths (e.g., unrestricted USB ports, devices outside protected area)|\n|Vulnerability|Lack of input validation|\n||Communication protocols with weak or no authentication|\n||Weak user authentication|\n||Least privileges not enforced|\n||Unpatched systems|\n|Damage Potential|Lack of safety system|\n||Safety system not independent of control system|\n|Detection|Host detection mechanism deficiency|\n||Network detection mechanism deficiency|\n||Lack of anti-virus software|\n|Recovery|Excessive recovery time|\n||Lack of ability to recover|\n\n\n-----\n\nthe maintenance provider prior to implementation. All changes will have to be tested to determine the\nimpact to production and operations. Some may even require extensive rewrites and are not feasible for\nincorporation into current software releases. In these cases, other defensive measures need to be defined\nand implemented. Each system needs to be considered on an individual basis following the applicable\nstandards, policies, and procedures respective to all contracts and legal obligations.\n\n#### A-4. Frequency of Occurrence\n\nEach assessment had different goals and vulnerability identification coverage. Therefore, specific\ncommon vulnerabilities are reported, but the number of assessments that tested for that particular\nvulnerability are not necessarily known.\n\nNote that not all systems were tested identically, not all vulnerability types were looked for in all\nsystems, and no single standardized testing methodology was used. Not every assessment examined each\ndefined security dimensions. In addition, not all vulnerabilities found are included in this report. To\nprevent identifying a specific system or vendor, this report includes only findings determined to be\ncommon to multiple systems. Future assessments will test for all common vulnerabilities identified in this\nreport, but it is expected that new common vulnerabilities will be identified in the future that have not\nbeen tested for in all assessments.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Appendix B\n Terms and Definitions\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n### Appendix B\n Terms and Definitions\n\n**Access Authorization**\nAccess authorization restricts access to or from a computer, server, Web site, or network to a group of\nusers through the application of authentication systems. These systems can protect either the whole\ncomputer, such as through an interactive logon screen, or individual services, such as an FTP server.\nThere are many methods for identifying and authenticating users, such as passwords, identification cards,\nsmart cards, and biometric systems.\n\n**ACL or Access Control List**\nAn Access Control List (ACL) is a list of permissions attached to a firewall, server, or other device on a\nnetwork. The list specifies who or what is allowed to access the device and what operations are allowed to\nbe performed on the device.\n\n**Antivirus Software**\nAntivirus software consists of a computer program that attempts to identify, neutralize, or eliminate\nmalicious software (i.e., viruses, Trojan horses, malware, spyware).\n\n**ARP**\nAddress Resolution Protocol (ARP) is the standard method for finding a host’s hardware address when\nonly its network layer address is known.\n\n**Buffer Overflow**\nThere are two types: stack buffer overflow and heap buffer overflow. Both types of overflow occur when\nan amount of data larger than the target data buffer area is written to that buffer. The extra data overwrites\nadjacent memory locations in either the stack (temporary memory) or the heap (dynamic memory) with\ncorrupt data values causing erroneous program results or malicious code to be executed.\n\n**Change Management**\nThe change management process is the process of requesting, determining attainability, planning,\nimplementing, and evaluation of changes to a system. It has two main goals: supporting the processing of\nchanges and enabling traceability of changes.\n\n**Control System**\nA device or set of devices to manage, command, direct, or regulate the behavior of other devices or\nsystems.\n\n**DMZ**\nA demilitarized zone (DMZ), more appropriately known as demarcation zone or perimeter network, is a\nphysical or logical sub-network that interfaces an organization’s external services to a larger, untrusted\nnetwork, usually the Internet. The purpose of a DMZ is to add an additional layer of security to an\norganization’s Local Area Network (LAN).\n\n\n-----\n\n**DNP3**\nDistributed Network Protocol is a set of communications protocols used between components in process\nautomation systems. Its main use is in utilities, such as electric and water companies. Usage in other\nindustries is not common, although technically possible. Specifically, it was developed to facilitate\ncommunications between various types of data acquisition and control equipment. It plays a crucial role\nin SCADA systems, where it is used by SCADA Master Stations (Control Centers), Remote Terminal\nUnits (RTUs), and Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs). It is used only for communications between a\nmaster station and RTUs or IEDs. ICCP, the Inter-Control Center Protocol, is used for inter-master station\ncommunications.\n\n**Encryption**\nEncryption is the process of transforming information (referred to as plaintext or clear text) using an\nalgorithm (called a cipher) to make it unreadable to anyone except those possessing special knowledge,\nusually referred to as a key.\n\n**Exploit**\nAn exploit (from the same word in the French language, meaning “achievement” or “accomplishment”) is\na piece of software, a chunk of data, or sequence of commands that take advantage of a bug, glitch, or\nvulnerability in order to cause unintended or unanticipated behavior to occur on computer software,\nhardware, or something electronic (usually computerized). This frequently includes such things as gaining\ncontrol of a computer system or allowing privilege escalation or a denial-of-service attack.\n\n**Finding**\nAn item identified during an assessment. It can be a vulnerability, an observation, a weakness, a flaw, a\ncode error, or a concern.\n\n**Firewall**\nFirewalls can either be hardware devices or software programs. They provide some protection from\nonline intrusion. They are systems that help protect computers and computer networks from attack and\nsubsequent intrusion by restricting the network traffic that can pass through them, based on a set of\nsystem administrator defined rules.\n\n**Fuzzing or Fuzz Testing**\nA software testing technique that uses random data, also known as “fuzz,” as input to the software. This\ntechnique attempts to exercise code by using values that may be outside the normal range of values the\nsoftware was designed for. By doing this the testing, it will uncover areas of the code that were\ninadequate in handling input values outside of the normally desired ranges.\n\n**ICCP**\nThe Inter-Control Center Communications Protocol (ICCP or IEC 60870-6/TASE.2) is being specified by\nutility organizations throughout the world to provide data exchange over wide area networks (WANs)\nbetween utility control centers, utilities, power pools, regional control centers, and Non-Utility\nGenerators. ICCP is also an international standard: International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)\nTelecontrol Application Service Element 2 (TASE.2).\n\n**Ground Truthing**\nThe technique of verifying that results obtained from lab testing or simulations are repeatable in realworld situations. An example: lab results show a particular configuration creates a vulnerability. Ground\ntruthing of this is accomplished by checking the production system and verifying that indeed a\nvulnerability exists.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Information Leaks**\nInside information that is carelessly disseminated, such as passwords written on sticky notes or shared\namong users. This can also include information items such as user IDs, passwords, and other system\ninformation that is not encrypted when transmitted or when stored.\n\n**Least Privileges**\nThe technique of assigning privileges for doing certain functions to only those that require them. For\nexample, restricting the ability to create new user accounts to only the system administrator or a user that\nshould only be able to query a database, but has privileges to delete the folder containing the database file.\n\n**Man-in-the-Middle Attack**\nThe man-in-the-middle attack (MITM) or bucket-brigade attack is a form of active eavesdropping in\nwhich the attacker makes independent connections with computers that communicate with one another\nand relays messages between them, making them believe that they are talking directly to each other over a\nprivate connection when in fact the entire conversation is controlled by the attacker.\n\n**Protocol**\nA protocol is the set of standard rules for data representation, signaling, authentication, and error\ndetection required to send information over a communications channel.\n\n**Reliability**\nReliability is the ability of a system to perform and maintain its functions in routine circumstances, as\nwell as hostile or unexpected circumstances.\n\n**Safety System**\nA Safety System or Safety Instrumented System (SIS) is a control system consisting of sensors, one or\nmore controllers, and final elements. The purpose of an SIS is to monitor an industrial process for\npotentially dangerous conditions and to alarm or execute preprogrammed action to either prevent a\nhazardous event from occurring or mitigate the consequences of such an event should it occur.\n\n**Social Engineering Awareness**\nKeeping employees aware of the dangers of social engineering and/or having a policy in place to prevent\nsocial engineering can reduce successful breaches of the network and servers.\n\n**Taxonomy**\nThe science, laws, or principles of classification.\n\n\n-----",
