We later extended our honeypot base on a misconfigured deployment of\n\nRedis, a popular open-source in-memory data structure store designed for deployment\n\nonly in secure environments. This confirmed our observations on the cryptocurrency mining\n\ntrend, which we decided to further investigate.\n\nIn 2020, we noticed that the deployment scripts became more advanced[1] and more\n\naggressive to other malicious actors.[2] The payloads were created by a malicious actor\n\ngroup called TeamTNT.\n\nBased on its activities, TeamTNT’s main motivation for its campaigns is money, which it tries\n\nto obtain by targeting Linux environments, including organizations’ cloud infrastructures.\n\nWe have previously written about TeamTNT and noted the evolution of its activities. In this\n\npaper, we aim to summarize our findings on the group by taking a closer look at its activities\n\nin 2020 and early 2021.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Background\n\nThe first possible mention of TeamTNT was in 2011, when a website called gold.de was hacked by a group\n\nusing the signature “HildeGard@TeamTNT”.[3] This is similar to the signatures we saw in some malicious\n\nshell scripts and ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) files, which contained the words “TeamTNT” and\n\n“HildeGard”.\n\nFigure 1. TeamTNT’s signatures\n\nWe believe that at least some members of the group are actors who are native German speakers as their\n\nscripts and text, including posts on social media, are written in fluent German.\n\nFigure 2. Examples of TeamTNT’s usage of German on social media and in shell scripts. The shell script\ntext shows a tongue-in-cheek comment from a TeamTNT developer complaining that he would\nhave to take his wife to Japan for a vacation.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe precise number of people behind a hacking group is always difficult to estimate. Such a number\n\ntherefore has to be considered with an error margin. However, we believe that the number of people\n\nbehind TeamTNT is at least — if not exactly — 12. This estimate is based on one of the group’s posts on\n\nits Twitter account. We also believe that the group is actively hiring new members.\n\nFigure 3. A tweet from TeamTNT complaining about managing a group of 12 programmers\n\nIdentifying the individual members of the team can be an even more difficult challenge. Since we do not\n\nwant to make false attributions in our research, we do not speculate on this matter.\n\nThe actors behind TeamTNT profile themselves either as “honest robbers” who mean no harm or as red\n\nteam penetration testers, often teasing security researchers in the process. But as we can see in the later\n\nsection on cryptocurrency mining, the group’s seemingly “harmless” activity can actually cause heavy\n\nfinancial losses.\n\nFigure 4. TeamTNT’s red team profile and researcher teasing\n\n\n-----\n\nTeamTNT is active on Twitter, tending to announce its active campaigns and new malware features on\n\nthe social network. The group also uses social media to justify its cause or to complain about security\n\ncompanies and researchers.\n\nFigure 5. TeamTNT’s Christmas campaign notification on Twitter\n\nFigure 6. A tweet from TeamTNT complaining about security researchers\n\n\n-----\n\n## Campaigns and Targets\n\nWe followed the activities of TeamTNT and reported on several incidents, beginning with its attack that\n\ninvolved the deployment of cryptocurrency miners and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) botnets\n\nagainst open and misconfigured Docker Daemon ports.[4] In 2020 and early 2021, we tracked more incidents\n\ninvolving the group, including its use of the DDoS-capable IRC (Internet Relay Chat) bot TNTbotinger[5] in\n\nDecember 2020 and its integration of a malicious shell script for stealing cloud credentials in January\n\n2021.[6]\n\nIndeed, TeamTNT launched a number of campaigns in 2020 and early 2021. Some of them were fairly\n\nsimple and straightforward, such as the group’s Covid-19 campaign, which capitalized on pandemic\nrelated topics for its malware nomenclature. Others made full use of the TeamTNT’s repertoire of tools\n\nand techniques. We discuss some of the more notable ones in the succeeding subsections. It should be\n\nnoted that the campaigns are not displayed in any specific order. Furthermore, some of the characteristics\n\nof the malware used in these campaigns, such as the malware’s wormlike behavior, also make it difficult\n\nto determine whether they are still actively being pursued by the group.\n\n**Campaign name** **Language**\n\nCovid-19 English/German\n\nBlack-T English\n\nCompetitor Killer English\n\nDual Installer English\n\nKinsing Killer English/German\n\nMeoow English/German\n\nSayHi English\n\nWeave Persistent English\n\nPWN Redis English/German\n\nGet Some SSH English\n\nDocker4Mac English\n\nAWS Stealer English\n\nTable 1.

In its case, the group did\n\nso specifically in naming its malware and deployment URLs. The group took advantage of related topics\n\nto spread malicious samples, with the first seen in April 2020 and the last in May 2020. The campaign\n\nwas short-lived, which was unusual given that the pandemic had then just started. It is possible that the\n\ngroup was not getting the results it wanted, or that it did not want to linger in an already crowded space.\n\nFigure 7. A sample code snippet from TeamTNT’s Covid-19 campaign\n\n##### Black-T\n\nA unique feature of TeamTNT’s Black-T campaign was its function called INFECT_ALL_CONTAINERS,\n\nwhich did exactly what its name implied: Check for running containers and deploy malicious samples in\n\nthese containers.\n\nFigure 8. A sample code snippet showing the INFECT_ALL_CONTAINERS function\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter deploying malicious samples in the running containers, it also deployed malicious containers —\n\nanother unique characteristic of this campaign, and one that generated plenty of awareness within the\n\nDevOps community.\n\nFigure 9. A forum post regarding TeamTNT’s Black-T campaign\n\n##### Kinsing Killer\n\nA threat known for targeting container systems, Kinsing[7] gained notoriety at the beginning of 2020 when it\n\ntargeted misconfigured Docker Daemon API ports.[8] Since the target environments were shared and there\n\nwas fierce competition for resources, TeamTNT started implementing functions to find and neutralize\n\ntraces of Kinsing infections on the victim environments to ensure that its malware was the only one\n\nrunning — a technique it also used against “competitors.”\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 10. A sample code snippet from TeamTNT’s Kinsing Killer campaign\n\n##### Docker4Mac\n\nIn December 2020, we sourced a sample from a campaign we called Docker4Mac because of the unique\n\nstring found in the code, a marker indicating the primary targets: Docker users with macOS machines. We\n\ndetermined that the sample was based on a valid script from an open-source project called Weave Scope,\n\nwhich maps, monitors, and manages containers and pods. TeamTNT injected malicious instructions into\n\nthe file, changing its purpose, luring project users, and infecting container and container orchestration\n\nenvironments.[9]\n\nThis campaign aims to steal cloud service provider (CSP) credentials and deploy a cryptocurrency miner\n\nduring the same routine — something not seen before as the group’s other campaigns would perform these\n\nactions in different phases of the attack. This was also one of the first times that container orchestration\n\ntechnologies were targeted, in this case via proxy.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 11. Code snippets from the first sample sourced (top) and the last lines of the same sample\n(bottom) from TeamTNT’s Docker4Mac campaign\n\n##### AWS Stealer\n\nMalicious actors typically exploit a security weakness in a target device to be able to execute their code\n\nand ultimately accomplish their goals.[10] But with exploits becoming too expensive to purchase and finding\n\nnew vulnerabilities becoming more complicated with more secure systems, some malicious actors — in\n\nthis case, TeamTNT actors — instead look for misconfigurations or improper implementations of settings\n\nas an entry point into their target system.\n\n\n-----\n\nToward the end of 2020, TeamTNT started a campaign targeting customer instances running on Amazon\n\nWeb Services (AWS).[11] In this scenario, if TeamTNT was able to compromise and access an instance,\n\nthe group would be able to access any credentials available via the instance’s metadata service. It is\n\nimportant to note that the metadata server can be queried only from inside an instance since the IP\n\naddress is a link-local address. As containers and misconfigured services were the previous targets of\n\nTeamTNT, the group coincidentally had its malware running on a couple of hundred customer instances.\n\nFigure 12. Searching for exploits and misconfigurations in a target system\n\nWhile TeamTNT’s infection routines vary depending on the campaign, a typical attack pattern involves the\n\ngroup’s scanner obtaining a list of targets (for example, IP addresses), which it then scans for security\n\nweaknesses and misconfigurations, such as unsecured Redis instances, vulnerable internet-of-things\n\n(IoT) devices, exposed Docker APIs, leaked credentials, and devices accessible via Secure Shell (SSH).\n\n\n-----\n\nScanner List of targets Scan results Exploitable security Payload delivery\n(e.g., IP addresses) weakness\n\nExploitable Victim\nsecurity weakness\n\nFigure 13. A typical infection chain used by TeamTNT\n\nIf TeamTNT finds a security issue from the obtained scan results, the group starts delivering its payloads to\n\nvictims. If able to be run on compromised hosts, the group’s typical payloads include credential stealers,\n\nlocal network scanners, reverse/bind shells, cryptocurrency miners, and even IRC bots.\n\nFor an enterprise, the impact of a successful TeamTNT attack could be particularly devastating. In a later\n\nsection, we discuss the monetary impact of a cryptocurrency miner payload. But that is just one part of\n\nthe story: Beyond what an organization or an individual could lose monetarily, attacks could also disrupt\n\nwhole systems through resource hijacking, leading to denial of service and other interruptions to the\n\noperation.\n\nPerhaps even more concerning for an organization is the theft of cloud credentials, which, depending on\n\nthe permissions associated with them, could allow a malicious actor to access and even gain control over\n\nparts of the IT infrastructure. From there, the actor could perform a number of malicious activities, such\n\nas shutting down systems, accessing confidential data, creating backdoors to gain permanent access to\n\nthe system, and, of course, installing cryptocurrency miners and other malware.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Credential Theft Techniques\n\nOne of TeamTNT’s primary goals with its activities is the theft of an organization’s credentials. This could be\n\nparticularly damaging, as the group could use the credentials, depending on the permissions associated\n\nwith them, to gain access to other IT systems in order to infect more machines and deploy additional\n\ncryptocurrency miners.\n\nIn this section, we describe a few of the techniques the group uses to steal credentials.\n\n##### SSH Credential Theft\n\nA behavior of TeamTNT we have often observed is the theft of local credentials and the creation of local\n\nusers while ensuring that the selected user is configured to be reachable over SSH. This is done to create\n\na method of returning to the system after the infection. In many cases, the attackers deploy their own\n\nSSH public keys.\n\nFigure 14. An example of code used by TeamTNT to search for compromised systems from\nwhich the group could steal SSH credentials\n\n##### AWS Credential Theft\n\nBeginning in the last quarter of 2020, many of the samples we found featured functions designed to\n\nsearch an infected system for AWS credentials. Initially, these samples had only bare-bones features,\n\nsearching for the credentials file under the root user home folder. But the group soon released a newer\n\nvariant that expanded the search to other users, with the end goal of gaining access to any credentials\n\nplaced by customers in ~/.aws/credentials.[12]\n\n\n-----\n\nThe newer versions of the malware now search multiple locations and check environment variables where\n\ncustomers might have placed AWS credentials. The primary targets of these functions are users who use\n\nthe AWS command-line interface tool or AWS frameworks that allow saving of authorization information\n\non the user’s machine — in either plain-text files or plain-text variables.\n\n##### Docker API Credential Theft\n\nIn January 2021, we acquired via a container honeypot a sample that showed an interesting behavior: It\n\nsearches compromised systems not only for SSH and AWS credentials but also for Docker API credentials.\n\nAny credential files that the malware finds are uploaded to a command-and-control (C&C) server.\n\nFigure 15. An example of code used by TeamTNT to search for compromised systems from\nwhich the group could steal Docker API credentials\n\nDocker users who wish to manage the service remotely can customize the API with their desired settings\n\n— from no security whatsoever to cryptography and credential requirements. While data from Shodan\n\nshows that the number of unsecure Docker APIs have been decreasing, malicious actors are also\n\nseemingly adapting to the times by customizing their malware further.\n\n##### Advanced Credential Harvesting\n\nIn 2021, we discovered a TeamTNT campaign with extended credential harvesting capabilities targeting\n\ncustomers of multiple cloud services and other services that potential victims might be using. These\n\ninclude AWS, Cloudflare, Google Cloud, Git, SMB services, FTP, and other services where credentials\n\nmight be present.[13]\n\n\n-----\n\n## Backdoors\n\nAs TeamTNT continuously develops and tests its payloads, we have seen the group deploy multiple\n\nbackdoors, including two open-source remote shells.[14]\n\nOne is named tshd (tiny shell daemon). Using keywords from the reversed binary, we were able to track it\n\nback to the open-source GitHub project. The other backdoor is inspired by Q-shell, a remote shell using\n\nBlowfish encryption for transmitted data. However, the dominant payload is the adopted IRC bot we\n\ndescribe in the later section on TeamTNT’s IRC bot.\n\nFigure 16. Examples of the backdoors used by TeamTNT\n\n\n-----\n\n## Diamorphine Rootkit\n\nAnother trend we observed in 2020 is the integration of rootkits into Linux-based threats for persistence\n\nand stealth.[15] Stealth, in particular, is a crucial factor for cryptocurrency mining activities since, without\n\nany limitations in place, the mining process will quickly raise red flags as the CPU utilization spikes to\n\n100%. Even if this anomalous behavior is not spotted by an administrator, it will likely trigger warnings in\n\nthe cloud provider’s system, which will then send a notification to the user. To get around this, malware\n\nauthors have introduced new features to hide the process from administrators and system tools.\n\nTeamTNT is no exception. The group uses a kernel-mode open-source rootkit called Diamorphine,[16] which\n\ncreates function hooks for the following system calls:\n\n- getdents/getdents64: This hook allows hiding file system entries from user-mode applications. The\n\nactual process hiding is implemented in this hook as the Unix uses the /proc pseudo-file system as\n\nan interface to kernel process structures.\n\n- kill: This hook implements the main functionality of the rootkit, which is dependent on the signal sent\n\nto the process based on the following:\n\nº The signal SIGINVIS = 31 flips the process custom PF_INVISIBLE flag to the task associated with\n\nthe specified process ID (pid).\n\n\nif ((task = find_task(pid)) == NULL)\n\nreturn -ESRCH;\n\ntask->flags ^= PF_INVISIBLE;\n\nbreak;\n\n\nº The signal SIGSUPER = 64 obtains root privileges by committing new credentials with uids = 0.\n\nº The signal SIGMODINVIS = 63 hides/reveals the presence of the kernel module.\n\n\n-----\n\nDiamorphine is used for hiding the cryptocurrency mining process in which, in this context, the kernel\n\nmodule itself is hidden by default as the hide function is called during the module initialization phase.\n\nFigure 17. The Diamorphine module initialization phase\n\nThe following discussion demonstrates the described behavior of Diamorphine.\n\nAfter the cryptocurrency process using XMRig is started, the signal SIGINVIS is sent to the mining process.\n\nFigure 18. The XMRig process\n\nThis is done by executing the kill utility with the argument SIGINVIS and the target process ID. The utility\n\ncalls linux syscall, which is then intercepted by Diamorphine, rendering the process invisible to user-mode\n\napplications.\n\nFigure 19. Sending a SIGINVIS signal to the Diamorphine rootkit, effectively hiding\nthe cryptocurrency mining process\n\nIf we compare the output of the top utility before the hiding signal is sent to the rootkit module and after\n\nthe signal is sent, we can observe that the XMRig process (pid = 12254) is causing the CPU usage to\n\nspike.[17]\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 20. The top output before the signal is sent\n\nHowever, after the hiding signal is sent, the process is not seen by the utility and remains undetected.\n\nAt this point, we should emphasize that a root user permission with CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability is\n\nrequired to install the kernel module. As malware authors target container environments, there is the\n\ndanger of privileged containers that allow users to obtain full host root with all capabilities and thus can\n\nalso be used to install kernel mode rootkits such as Diamorphine.\n\nMalware authors have also optimized the usability of XMRig for cloud environments by decreasing the\n\nmaximum percentage of CPU usage in order to remain undetected and not trigger necessary alarms. It\n\nshould be noted that running unwanted cryptocurrency miners in public clouds will lead to additional\n\ncosts.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Notable Payload Functionalities\n\nTeamTNT deploys a number of payloads in its campaigns, including cryptocurrency miners, credential\n\nstealers, and even IRC bots (which we discuss in a later section). Many of these payloads have interesting\n\nfunctionalities that are designed to make them stealthier and more efficient.\n\n##### Pushing Out the Competition\n\nWhen a security weakness in an internet-connected device is present, there is a high chance that multiple\n\nattackers will target it for their own purposes. Given that some malware, such as cryptocurrency miners,\n\noften makes heavy use of hardware resources, malicious actors often find it necessary to ensure that no\n\nother malicious actors are running their own payloads, since this will result in resources being split among\n\nthe payloads.\n\nTeamTNT is no different, as the group has implemented its own ever-evolving functions for pushing out\n\ncompeting cryptocurrency miners. An example of this is mentioned in a previous section; in that example,\n\nTeamTNT pushes out traces of Kinsing in a target’s system.\n\nFigure 21. A function showing how a cryptocurrency miner from TeamTNT pushes out the competition\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 22. Neutralizing traces of Kinsing in the target’s system\n\n##### Persistence Mechanisms\n\nThe second stage of a TeamTNT payload is typically designed for persistence, where it will be executed\n\nagain even after the affected device is restarted. This is typically accomplished via a cryptocurrency miner\n\nsystem service.\n\nFigure 23. Creating persistence by deploying system services\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Custom User Agent\n\nEarly versions of TeamTNT’s payloads used downloads via wget[18] and curl[19] without any additional\n\nparameters. Over time, the group introduced a custom user agent[20] HTTP header into its shell scripts,\n\nallowing them to have special handling routines on the server side for providing better statistics or limiting\n\npayload downloads for specified agents. The user agent header varies across TeamTNT’s campaigns.\n\nFigure 24. An example of TeamTNT’s custom user agent usage\n\n##### Lockdown\n\nThe lockdown function first removes an immutability flag that might have been set on the binaries —\n\nwhich are used for shutting down or rebooting the targeted machine — for protective reasons. The script\n\nthen removes any execution permission from the binaries and finally sets the immutability property again,\n\nmaking sure that the binaries cannot be replaced, be modified, or have their permissions changed.\n\nAltering the properties is done using chattr, which is clever since this command is not well known.\n\nFigure 25. The lockdown function in action\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Account Creation\n\nIn some campaigns, TeamTNT creates a new user in the affected system in order to gain future access.\n\nThe group also includes its own SSH public key to be able to log in using its private key via the key pair\n\nauthentication system.[21]\n\nFigure 26. Creating a new system account\n\n##### Masquerading the Payload\n\nThe initial payloads deployed by TeamTNT were distributed without any obfuscation, encryption, or\n\npacking, with the deploying shell scripts being written in plain text. Eventually, the group evolved its\n\npayloads by replacing the plain-text shell scripts with ones that had Base64 encoding.\n\nIn the case of ELF binaries, TeamTNT started by using packers such as the popular multiplatform\n\nexecutable packer UPX (Ultimate Packer for Executables).[22] The next version added another layer on\n\ntop of the packed UPX executable, a Go-compiled binary with a payload, encrypted via AES (Advanced\n\nEncryption Standard), with a hard-coded key and initialization vector. The packer used is based on the\n\nEzuri packer, a freely available project on GitHub.[23]\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 27. Using the Ezuri packer in one of TeamTNT’s campaigns\n\n\n-----\n\n## IRC Bot Evolution\n\nChatbots provide a number of specific functions. For example, they can be used for game notifications,\n\nbuild notifications, or status messages in corporate environments. But they can also be used for malicious\n\npurposes. Together with open protocol specifications and open-source software, chatbots can be used\n\nto deploy communication channels for malicious actors. An IRC server can act as the C&C module of\n\nmalware, sending commands to connected bots (infected clients). An example of a malicious IRC bot is\n\nthe notorious Dorkbot, which exfiltrates credentials in an infected system via IRC messages.[24]\n\nOne of the first known pieces of malware targeting IoT devices was Hydra, which was released in 2008.\n\nIt used IRC botnets — that is, networks of IRC bots — in its DDoS attacks.[25] Two years later, Kaiten (aka\n\nTsunami) extended bot capabilities by adding several functionalities, such as a bot-killing feature that\n\nremoves traces of previous infections from an infected router.[26]\n\nFigure 28. The help function showing available commands from the leaked Kaiten source code\n\nTeamTNT also has its own IRC bot in its attacks. Based on the nonstripped information left by the compiler\n\nas well as the bot’s functions, we can surmise that the initial version of the IRC bot used by the group is\n\nbased on Kaiten.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 29. The nonstripped kaiten.c compile information indicating that the initial version\nof TeamTNT’s IRC bot is based on Kaiten\n\nAs the source code is publicly available on GitHub, it is no surprise that malicious actors are already using\n\nthis software.\n\nFigure 30. TeamTNT’s IRC bot decompiled\n\nLater versions of the bot are based on an evolved Kaiten variant called Ziggy StarTux, which introduces\n\nnew commands and a simple transposition cipher to encrypt “confidential” strings such as the server\n\naddress.\n\nFigure 31. A snippet of the Ziggy StarTux source code with new commands added\n\nIt is likely that the introduction of a new version of the bot was a result of the group’s looking to expand\n\nthe functionalities of the base version.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs if to stamp its mark on the tool, TeamTNT started to place its own signatures on the IRC bot, in addition\n\nto its modifications.\n\nFigure 32. A version of TeamTNT’s IRC bot that includes a custom signature\n\nThe group also implemented its own commands, which are used to download the source and compile the\n\ndelivery scheme on a victim machine.\n\nFigure 33.

TeamTNT’s IRC bot deployment\n\n\n-----\n\n## Impact of Cryptocurrency Mining Activities\n\nCryptocurrencies have changed how malware monetization works. One example of this is the use of\n\ncryptocurrencies for ransomware payments, which lends transactions both anonymity and the potential\n\nfor easy laundering.[27] Another type of cryptocurrency monetization is cryptocurrency mining, which,\n\nalthough not malicious by itself, is often brought upon unsuspecting users by malicious actors.\n\nMost devices often do not provide enough computational power for effective cryptocurrency mining.\n\nThus, to compensate for this lack, malicious actors often either target more powerful and efficient devices\n\nor simply use a sizeable botnet in a quantity-over-quality scenario. In any case, cryptocurrency mining\n\ndemands plenty in terms of hardware, electricity, and other associated resources. One of the frequent\n\ntargets of cryptocurrency mining attacks is Linux systems with open and unsecure services and APIs,\n\nsuch as container engines that provide benefits to organizations in the development and environmental\n\nstability of deployed applications.\n\nWith the global market capitalization of cryptocurrencies at US$1.63 trillion at the time of this writing (June\n\n2021),[28] cryptocurrency mining is a lucrative opportunity for monetization. During our investigation of\n\nTeamTNT, we found several wallet IDs connected to the same cryptocurrency pool, gulf[.]moneroocean[.]\n\nstream. Using the pool statistics of the wallets, we discovered that the group had mined more than 17.86\n\nMonero coins. Because of the high volatility of the exchange rate over time, we could only estimate the US\n\ndollar value to range from US$1,100 to US$3,800 within the time frame from March 2020 to March 2021.[29]\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 35. An example of TeamTNT’s active mining pool usage from infected nodes\n\nWhile 17.86 Monero coins might not look high, the real cost of mining such an amount might paint a\n\ndifferent picture. To estimate the corresponding cost, we did an experiment using a 3.0-gigahertz, 6-core\n\nIntel i5-8500B Coffee Lake CPU with 8 gigabytes of RAM, which is not a high-end platform and has no\n\nGPU that can enhance cryptocurrency mining. Our model hardware was able to produce 1,000 hashes\n\nper second on average over a 24-hour period. This performance is above average compared to the\n\nnumber of hashes per second from infected nodes shown in Figure 35.\n\nOur hardware was able to mine 0.0005 Monero coins within 24 hours. To mine 17.86 Monero coins, we\n\nwould need approximately 35,600 infected devices with the same specifications mining for 24 hours. If we\n\nassume that the power consumption of the CPU is 100 watts, then the electrical energy needed for that\n\nwould be 85.44 megawatt-hours (MWh). If we use a conversion of 1 MWh equaling US$140, we would\n\nget an electricity bill of US$11,961.60 — not even taking into account the damage caused by operating\n\nat 100% load.\n\nIf we have to pay the electricity bill for the mining activities, we would lose over US$9,000 in our model\n\ncase. It should be noted that the real amount will be different as there are many variables to consider.\n\nFor instance, the price of electricity varies by geographic location, and not every machine has the same\n\nperformance or power efficiency. Still, the losses for users who have their machines used for mining\n\nactivities will be considerable.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusion\n\nMalware monetization remains a strong motivator for malicious actors. With organizations focusing on\n\ncloud technologies amid the Covid-19 pandemic, it is not surprising to see malicious actor groups shifting\n\ntheir operations to the cloud as it becomes an increasingly lucrative target. Cryptocurrency mining remains\n\npopular as a monetization method because of its stealth and heavy automation, allowing malicious actors\n\nto deploy their malware with relative ease. The availability of open-source software like Diamorphine also\n\nprovides malicious actor groups with additional tools for their arsenal.\n\nTeamTNT itself has been shifting its focus to cloud technologies. In its recent campaigns, the group has\n\nbeen actively searching for cloud credentials, exploiting server misconfigurations, and competing in the\n\ncryptocurrency mining sphere. Given what we have seen from the group in a relatively short time, we can\n\nexpect TeamTNT to continuously evolve its tools and techniques.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Recommendations\n\nWe have been seeing an increasing focus on cloud-based attacks and campaigns among groups\n\nsuch as TeamTNT, which are looking to take advantage of organizations shifting to cloud services.\n\nOrganizations should therefore be especially vigilant with their cloud implementations, paying heed\n\nto the shared responsibility model, in which the CSPs are responsible for securing the infrastructure\n\nwhile the organizations are responsible for handling the cloud assets, such as data, applications, and\n\nconfigurations.[30]\n\nWe recommend that security personnel and IT administrators implement best practices such as the\n\nfollowing to minimize the chance of a successful attack from a cloud-focused group like TeamTNT:\n\n- Apply the principle of least privilege, in which users are granted access only to the parts of the system\n\nthey need, to reduce the attack surface and help contain damage even in the event of a successful\n\nattack.[31]\n\n- For organizations that have SSH enabled, implement private keys authentication on the client side to\n\nenhance access control security.\n\n- Update systems and devices regularly to reduce the probability that vulnerabilities are exploited.[32]\n\nCloud-focused security solutions such as the Trend Micro Cloud One™ security services platform[33] helps\n\nprotect cloud-native systems by providing protection for continuous-integration and continuous-delivery\n\n(CI/CD) pipelines and applications. The platform includes:\n\n- Workload Security: runtime protection for workloads\n\n- Container Security: automated container image and registry scanning\n\n- File Storage Security: security for cloud files and object storage services\n\n- Network Security: cloud network layer for intrusion prevention system (IPS) security\n\n- Application Security: security for serverless functions, APIs, and applications\n\n- Conformity: real-time security for cloud infrastructure — secure, optimize, comply\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Appendix\n\n###### MITRE ATT&CK Tactics and Techniques\n\n|Reconnaissance|Resource development|Initial access|Execution|Persistence|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Active scanning Gather victim host information Gather victim network information|Compromise accounts Compromise infrastructure Establish accounts|Exploit public- facing application Valid accounts Trusted relationship|Command and scripting interpreter Inter-process communication Native API Scheduled task/job Shared modules Software deployment tools System services|Account manipulation Boot or logon autostart execution Compromise client software binary Implant container image|\n\n|Privilege escalation|Defense evasion|Credential access|Discovery|Lateral movement|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Exploitation for privilege escalation|Deobfuscate/ Decode files or information Impair defenses Rootkit|Steal application access token Unsecured credentials|Account discovery Cloud infrastructure discovery File and directory discovery Network service scanning Process discovery Remote system discovery System service discovery|Exploitation of remote services Lateral tool transfer Use alternate authentication material|\n\n\n-----\n\n|Collection|Command and control|Exfiltration|Impact|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Archive collected data Automated collection Data from local system Data from configuration repository|Application layer protocol Ingress tool transfer Multistage channels|Automated exfiltration Exfiltration over C&C channel Exfiltration over web service|Endpoint denial of service Resource hijacking Service stop System shutdown/ reboot Data manipulation|\n\n\n###### Indicators of Compromise\n\n Scripts\n\n|SHA-256|Detection/Version|\n|---|---|\n|4a632a65c253c616b1b7e9ca8e30e1b47f41d763d340f72c97652b26c8b26741|Trojan.SH.CVE20207961.SM/16.699.00|\n|d579b34d0bc04b656f3c318de96180c84f9ff56eec6722fefb9599a7da353bd5|Trojan.SH.CVE20207961.SM/16.699.00|\n|0d7912e62bc663c9ba6bff21ae809e458b227e3ceec0abac105d20d5dc533a22|TROJ_FRS.VSNTE621/16.699.00|\n|28ac05c81f3a2d972da21ffa3f1ec107c56733f43b19d6c436dd3a541a2c07e2|Backdoor.Linux.MALXMR.
