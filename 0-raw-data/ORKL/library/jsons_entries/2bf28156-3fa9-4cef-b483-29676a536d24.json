    "plain_text": "# Japanese Targets\n\nFireEye has discovered a campaign leveraging the recently announced zero-day CVE-2013-3893. This\n\ncampaign, which we have labeled ‘Operation DeputyDog’, began as early as August 19, 2013 and appears\n\nto have targeted organizations in Japan. FireEye Labs has been continuously monitoring the activities of\n\nthe threat actor responsible for this campaign. Analysis based on our Dynamic Threat Intelligence cluster\n\nshows that this current campaign leveraged command and control infrastructure that is related to the\n\ninfrastructure used in the attack on Bit9.\n\n**Campaign Details**\n\n[On September 17, 2013 Microsoft published details regarding a new zero-day exploit in Internet Explorer](http://blogs.technet.com/b/srd/archive/2013/09/17/cve-2013-3893-fix-it-workaround-available.aspx)\n\n[that was being used in targeted attacks. FireEye can confirm reports that these attacks were directed](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/advisory/2887505)\n\nagainst entities in Japan. Furthermore, FireEye has discovered that the group responsible for this\n\n**[new operation is the same threat actor that compromised Bit9 in February 2013.](https://blog.bit9.com/2013/02/25/bit9-security-incident-update/)**\n\nFireEye detected the payload used in these attacks on August 23, 2013 in Japan. The payload was hosted\n\non a server in Hong Kong (210.176.3.130) and was named “img20130823.jpg”. Although it had a .jpg\n\nfile extension, it was not an image file. The file, when XORed with 0×95, was an executable (MD5:\n\n8aba4b5184072f2a50cbc5ecfe326701).\n\nUpon execution, 8aba4b5184072f2a50cbc5ecfe326701 writes “28542CC0.dll” (MD5:\n\n46fd936bada07819f61ec3790cb08e19) to this location:\n\nC:\\Documents and Settings\\All Users\\Application Data\\28542CC0.dll\n\nIn order to maintain persistence, the original malware adds this registry key:\n\nHKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\28542CC0\n\nThe registry key has this value:\n\nrundll32.exe “C:\\Documents and Settings\\All Users\\Application Data\\28542CC0.dll”,Launch\n\nThe malware (8aba4b5184072f2a50cbc5ecfe326701) then connects to a host in South Korea\n\n(180.150.228.102). This callback traffic is HTTP over port 443 (which is typically used for HTTPS\n\nencrypted traffic; however, the traffic is not HTTPS nor SSL encrypted). Instead, this clear-text callback\n\ntraffic resembles this pattern:\n\n\n-----\n\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n\n**Agtid: [8 chars]08x**\n\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Win32)\n\nHost: 180.150.228.102:443\n\nContent-Length: 1045\n\nConnection: Keep-Alive\n\nCache-Control: no-cache\n\n[8 chars]08x&[Base64 Content]\n\nThe unique HTTP header “Agtid:” contains 8 characters followed by “08x”. The same pattern can be seen\n\nin the POST content as well.\n\nA second related sample was also delivered from 111.118.21.105/css/sun.css on September 5, 2013. The\n\nsun.css file was a malicious executable with an MD5 of bd07926c72739bb7121cec8a2863ad87 and it\n\ncommunicated with the same communications protocol described above to the same command and\n\ncontrol server at 180.150.228.102.\n\n**Related Samples**\n\nWe found that both droppers, bd07926c72739bb7121cec8a2863ad87 and\n\n8aba4b5184072f2a50cbc5ecfe326701, were compiled on 2013-08-19 at 13:21:59 UTC. As we examined\n\nthese files, we noticed a unique fingerprint.\n\nThese samples both had a string that may have been an artifact of the builder used to create the binaries.\n\nThis string was “DGGYDSYRL”, which we refer to as “DeputyDog”. As such, we developed the following\n\nYARA signature, based on this unique attribute:\n\n**rule APT_DeputyDog_Strings**\n\n**{**\n\n**meta:**\n\n**author = “FireEye Labs”**\n\n**version = “1.0″**\n\n**description = “detects string seen in samples used in 2013-3893 0day attacks”**\n\n**reference = “8aba4b5184072f2a50cbc5ecfe326701″**\n\n**strings:**\n\n\n-----\n\n**$a = DGGYDSYRL**\n\n**condition:**\n\n**($mz at 0) and $a**\n\n**}**\n\nWe used this signature to identify 5 other potentially related samples:\n\n**MD5** **Compile Time (UTC)** **C2 Server**\n58dc05118ef8b11dcb5f5c596ab772fd 2013-08-19 13:21:58 180.150.228.102\n4d257e569539973ab0bbafee8fb87582 2013-08-19 13:21:58 103.17.117.90\ndbdb1032d7bb4757d6011fb1d077856c 2013-08-19 13:21:59 110.45.158.5\n645e29b7c6319295ae8b13ce8575dc1d 2013-08-19 13:21:59 103.17.117.90\ne9c73997694a897d3c6aadb26ed34797 2013-04-13 13:42:45 110.45.158.5\n\nNote that all of the samples, except for e9c73997694a897d3c6aadb26ed34797, were compiled on 2013\n08-19, within 1 second of each other.\n\nWe pivoted off the command and control IP addresses used by these samples and found the following\n\nknown malicious domains recently pointed to 180.150.228.102.\n\n**Domain** **First Seen** **Last Seen**\nea.blankchair.com 2013-09-01 05:02:22 2013-09-01 08:25:22\nrt.blankchair.com 2013-09-01 05:02:21 2013-09-01 08:25:24\nali.blankchair.com 2013-09-01 05:02:20 2013-09-01 08:25:22\ndll.freshdns.org 2013-07-01 10:48:56 2013-07-09 05:00:03\n\n**Links to Previous Campaigns**\n\n[According to Bit9, the attackers that penetrated their network dropped two variants of the](https://blog.bit9.com/2013/02/25/bit9-security-incident-update/)\n\n**[HiKit rootkit.

This same IP address also hosted\n\nwww[.]yahooeast[.]net, a known malicious domain, between March 6, 2012 and April 22, 2012.\n\nThe domain yahooeast[.]net was registered to 654@123.com. This email address was also used to register\n\nblankchair[.]com – the domain that we see was pointed to the 180.150.228.102 IP, which is the callback\n\nassociated with sample 58dc05118ef8b11dcb5f5c596ab772fd, and has been already correlated back to the\n\nattack leveraging the CVE-2013-3893 zero-day vulnerability.\n\n**Threat Actor Attribution**\n\n|MD5|Compile Time (UTC)|C2 Server|\n|---|---|---|\n|58dc05118ef8b11dcb5f5c596ab772fd|2013-08-19 13:21:58|180.150.228.102|\n|4d257e569539973ab0bbafee8fb87582|2013-08-19 13:21:58|103.17.117.90|\n|dbdb1032d7bb4757d6011fb1d077856c|2013-08-19 13:21:59|110.45.158.5|\n|645e29b7c6319295ae8b13ce8575dc1d|2013-08-19 13:21:59|103.17.117.90|\n|e9c73997694a897d3c6aadb26ed34797|2013-04-13 13:42:45|110.45.158.5|\n\n|Domain|First Seen|Last Seen|\n|---|---|---|\n|ea.blankchair.com|2013-09-01 05:02:22|2013-09-01 08:25:22|\n|rt.blankchair.com|2013-09-01 05:02:21|2013-09-01 08:25:24|\n|ali.blankchair.com|2013-09-01 05:02:20|2013-09-01 08:25:22|\n|dll.freshdns.org|2013-07-01 10:48:56|2013-07-09 05:00:03|\n\n\n-----\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWhile these attackers have a demonstrated previously unknown zero-day exploits and a robust set of\n\nmalware payloads, using the techniques described above, it is still possible for network defense\n\nprofessionals to develop a rich set of indicators that can be used to detect their attacks. This is the first\n\npart of our analysis, we will provide more detailed analysis on the other components of this attack in\n\nsubsequent blog post.\n\n[This entry was posted in Advanced Malware, Exploits, Targeted Attack, Threat Intelligence, Threat](http://www.fireeye.com/blog/category/technical/malware-research)\n\n[Research by Ned Moran and Nart Villeneuve.
