On May 10, 2014 at 9:20 AM, the\nIC3 received its three millionth complaint online!\n\nIn 2014, the IC3 received 269,422 complaints with an adjusted dollar loss of $800,492,073[1]. On average,\napproximately 22,000 complaints were received each month. Internet crime has become a global issue with the\nsophistication of online criminal techniques and overlapping jurisdictional boundaries. The IC3 remains\ndedicated to meet the needs of law enforcement worldwide.\n\nThe 2014 Internet Crime Report highlights the IC3’s efforts to prevent and reduce the prevalence and impact of\nInternet crimes, and reveals at least two budding Internet crime trends. First, the increased use of social media\nhas provided a quintessential goldmine of personal data for perpetrators. More victims are submitting\ncomplaints documenting how social media was utilized to perpetrate frauds, or indicating the perpetrator\ninitiated a relationship through social engineering. Second, the emerging popularity of virtual currency has\nattracted perpetrators, who are capitalizing on the vulnerabilities of the digital currency systems.\n\nDue to the evolving nature of Internet crime and criminals achieving new levels of sophistication, the IC3 has\ndeveloped a more streamlined approach to reviewing, categorizing and analyzing complaints, which allows for\nnew trends to be recognized more quickly.\n\n1 Method of evaluating loss amounts: The IC3 staff reviewed complaints reporting a loss of greater than $100,000. Analysts\nconverted losses reported in foreign currencies to U.S. dollars. Reported losses greater than $100,000 for which the complaint information did\nnot support the loss amount were excluded from the statistics.\n\n\nI n t e r n e t C r i m e C o m p l a i n t C e n t e r Page 4\n\n\n-----\n\n#### History of the IC3\n\nIn May 2000, the IC3 was established as a center to receive complaints of Internet crime. In June 2007, the IC3\nreceived its one millionth. In November 2010, the IC3 received its two millionth complaint, and in May 2014, the\nIC3 reached the three million complaint milestone. Over the last five years, the IC3 received an average of nearly\n300,000 complaints per year. The complaints consisted of a wide array of Internet scams affecting victims of all\nnationalities, ages, backgrounds, educational levels, and socio-economic levels.\n\n\n### 3,175,611\n#### Complaints Reported to IC3\n Since Inception\n\n\nI n t e r n e t C r i m e C o m p l a i n t C e n t e r Page 5\n\n\n-----\n\n#### How it Works\n\nIn an interconnected world, the IC3 plays a critical role in our nation’s effort to reduce the amount of economic\nloss by Internet crime. One can view the IC3’s role in combating Internet crime as a part of an intricate puzzle.\n\nMillions of people in the United States are victims of Internet crimes each year. Only an estimated 15 percent of\nthe nation's fraud victims report their crimes to law enforcement[2], while the IC3 estimates less than 10 percent of\nvictims file directly through ww.ic3.gov. Detection is the cornerstone of the larger Internet crime picture.\n\n2 http://www.justice.gov/usao-wdwa/victim-witness/victim-info/financial fraud\n\n\nI n t e r n e t C r i m e C o m p l a i n t C e n t e r Page 6\n\n\n-----\n\nVictims are encouraged by law enforcement to file a complaint online at www.ic3.gov. Complainants are asked\nto document accurate and complete information related to the Internet crime, as well as any other relevant\ninformation necessary to support the complaint. In addition to reporting the crime, complainants should take\nsteps to mitigate further loss. Victims can take actions such as contacting banks, credit card companies and/or the\ncredit bureaus to block accounts, freeze accounts, dispute charges, or attempt recovery of lost funds. Victims\nshould be diligent in reviewing credit reports to dispute any unauthorized transactions and consider credit\nmonitoring services.\n\nThe IC3 is well positioned to be the central point for Internet crime victims to report and to alert the appropriate\nagencies of suspected criminal Internet activity. The IC3 reviews and analyzes data submitted through its\nwebsite, and produces intelligence products to highlight emerging threats and new trends. Public service\nannouncements (PSAs), scam alerts, and other fraud trend publications are routinely posted to the www.ic3.gov.\nAs more people become aware of Internet crimes and the methods utilized by criminals, potential victims are\nequipped with a broader understanding of the dangers associated with Internet activity and are in a better\nposition to avoid falling prey to schemes online.\n\nOne of the largest pieces of the puzzle falls into place when the IC3 aggregates related complaints to build\nreferrals which are forwarded to local, state, federal and international law enforcement agencies for potential\ninvestigation. If law enforcement conducts an investigation and determines a crime has been committed, legal\naction may be brought against the perpetrator. Each and every piece of this puzzle is necessary to assist law\nenforcement in stopping Internet crime\n\n\nI n t e r n e t C r i m e C o m p l a i n t C e n t e r Page 7\n\n\n-----\n\n#### 2014 Overall Statistics\n\n\n21,751\n\n20,888\n\n22,715\n\n22,042\n\n21,140\n\n21,947\n\n24,521\n\n24,076\n\n23,354\n\n22,847\n\n21,009\n\n23,132\n\n\n###### Average Dollar Loss\n Overall $2,971\n\n\n###### Complaints Reporting a Loss\n 123,684\n\n\n###### Average Dollar Loss\n for Complaints Reporting Loss\n $6,472\n\n\nI n t e r n e t C r i m e C o m p l a i n t C e n t e r Page 8\n\n\n###### Number of Visitors to www.ic3.gov \n 55,619,935\n\n\n###### Total Losses\n Reported $800,492,073\n\n\n-----\n\n#### 2014 Complainant Demographics\n\n###### Gender Count Percentage Age Count Male 140,229 52.05% Under 20 9,442 Female 129,193 47.95% 20-39 104,999\n 40-59 110,341\n\n 60 & Over 44,640\n\n#### Top 10 States by Count: Victim Complainants\n\n Top 5 Countries by Count: Victim Complainants\n\n|Gender|Count|Percentage|\n|---|---|---|\n|Male|140,229|52.05%|\n|Female|129,193|47.95%|\n\n|Age|Count|Percentage|\n|---|---|---|\n|Under 20|9,442|3.51%|\n|20-39|104,999|38.97%|\n|40-59|110,341|40.95%|\n|60 & Over|44,640|16.57%|\n\n\nI n t e r n e t C r i m e C o m p l a i n t C e n t e r Page 9\n\n\n-----\n\n#### 2014 Frequently Reported Internet Crimes\n\n Auto Fraud\n\nThe IC3 receives numerous complaints related to auto fraud scams. Although there are variations, the typical\nscam involves a consumer finding a vehicle on a legitimate website which is often below market value. The\nfraudster claims they must sell the vehicle quickly because they are relocating for work or being deployed by the\nmilitary and are in need of money. The criminal refuses to meet in person, will not allow an inspection of the\nvehicle, and often attempts to rush the sale. To make the deal appear legitimate, the criminal instructs the victim\nto wire full or partial payment to a third-party agent and to fax the payment receipt to the seller as proof of\npayment. The fraudster keeps the money but does not deliver the vehicle. See Appendix III for a full breakdown\nof the demographics captured for this scheme.\n\n\n$6,251,779\n\n$16,698,529\n\n$7,374,290\n\n$16,963,896\n\n$3,734,843\n\n$5,199,319\n\n\nI n t e r n e t C r i m e C o m p l a i n t C e n t e r Page 10\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Government Impersonation E-mail Scam\n\nThe IC3 receives complaints containing names of various government agencies and high-ranking government\nofficials being used in spam attacks in an attempt to defraud consumers. In 2014, the IC3 received approximately\n16 complaints per day of this type. With an average adjusted loss of approximately $1,450 per complaint, victims\nreported losing more than $23,200 in total to this scam every day. Scammers often pose as government or law\nenforcement officials to give them an appearance of authority, making it easier to convince unsuspecting victims\nto give their personal information. Complaints spoofing the name of Attorney General Eric Holder and FBI\nDirector James Comey encompass a large part of the government impersonation e-mail scams. It is important to\nnote government agencies do not send unsolicited e-mails. See Appendix III for a full breakdown of the\ndemographics captured for this scheme.\n\n\n$653,749\n\n$1,720,788\n\n$2,377,736\n\n$1,314,797\n\n$337,573\n\n$602,260\n\n$3,953,172\n\n$70,845\n\n$69,981\n\n$233,175\n\n\nI n t e r n e t C r i m e C o m p l a i n t C e n t e r Page 11\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Intimidation/Extortion Scam\n\nIntimidation and extortion scams use demands for money or property through undue exercise of authority,\nincluding threats of physical harm, criminal prosecution, or public exposure.\n\nPayday loans, also known as cash advance loans or deferred-deposit check loans, are usually short-term loans\nwith a high interest rate, and are among the most abundant type of extortion scams reported. The various\norganizations offer loans as a quick solution to an individual’s financial problems. The loans can be obtained\nwith very little paperwork, require no background check, and are often advertised as having no credit\nrestrictions. Criminals are capitalizing on the vulnerabilities of people in financial trouble.\n\nThe payday loan scheme involves receiving a call or e-mail notifying a loan is delinquent and must be paid in full\nto avoid legal consequences. The fraudster purports to be a representative of a legitimate agency and claims to be\ncollecting debts for a specific company. The scammer usually has accurate victim information, including social\nsecurity number, dates of birth, address, employer information, bank account numbers, and names and telephone\nnumbers of relatives and friends. The scammer relentlessly calls or e-mails the victim's home, cell phone, and\nplace of employment. The scammer refuses to provide any details of the alleged payday loans and becomes\nabusive when questioned. Victims are threatened with legal actions, arrests, and in some cases physical violence\nif they refuse to pay.

Criminals exploit legitimate online ads listing homes\nfor sale or rent, and repost the ads in an effort to redirect traffic to the subjects. The houses are usually listed\nbelow-market rental rates to immediately attract potential victims. Scammers typically e-mail the victim stating\nthey have to leave the area quickly due to employment or volunteer work. Some subjects claim they left the\nUnited States for missionary or contract work in another country. Victims are typically instructed to wire funds\nthrough a wire transfer service. Victims may be asked to fill out credit applications and provide personal\nidentifying information. See Appendix III for a full breakdown of the demographics captured for this scheme.\n\n\n## Real Estate Fraud  Total Losses Reported \n\n###### $3,235,036\n\nMale 49 and Under\n\nFemale 49 and Under\n\n###### $12,598,388\n\nMale and Female 50 and Over\n\n###### $3,966,747\n\n\n###### $3,235,036\n\n $12,598,388 $3,966,747\n\n\nI n t e r n e t C r i m e C o m p l a i n t C e n t e r Page 13\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Confidence Fraud/Romance Scam\n\nIn 2014, the IC3 received numerous complaints regarding confidence fraud and romance scams where the subject\nassumed the identities of military personnel. These schemes involve scammers pretending to seek\ncompanionship or romance online. Victims of these scams believe they are in a relationship with someone who is\nhonest and trustworthy without meeting them in person. Criminals search dating websites, chat rooms, and\nsocial media websites for personally identifiable information, and use well-rehearsed scripts to attract potential\nvictims. The criminals present convincing scenarios involving family tragedies, severe life circumstances, and\nother hardships in an attempt to solicit money.  See Appendix III for a full breakdown of the demographics\ncaptured for this scheme.\n\n\nI n t e r n e t C r i m e C o m p l a i n t C e n t e r Page 14\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Trends\n\n Social Media: A Popular Platform for Criminals\n\nOver the last decade, the growth and popularity of social media has increased. Social media has revolutionized\nthe way people interact with others and has become an integral part of life for people of all ages. Criminals have\nexploited social media by phishing for unwary users to fall victim to their scams. The IC3 complaint data shows\n12% of the complaints submitted in 2014 contained a social media aspect. Complaints involving social media\nhave quadrupled over the last five years. In most cases, victim’s personal information was exploited through\ncompromised accounts or social engineering.\n\n\n_\"115174897 Copyright David Evison, 2015_\n_Used under license from Shutterstock.com”_\n\n\nSome of the fraudulent methods identified by the IC3 include:\n\n  - **Click-jacking - Concealing hyperlinks beneath legitimate clickable content which, when clicked, causes a**\nuser to unknowingly perform actions, such as downloading malware, or sending personal information to\na website. Numerous click-jacking scams have employed “Like” and “Share” buttons on social\nnetworking websites. Research other ways to use your browser options to maximize security.\n\n  - **Doxing - Publicly releasing a person’s identifying information online without authorization. Caution**\nshould be exercised by users when sharing or posting information about themselves, family, and friends.\n\n  - **Pharming - Redirecting users from legitimate websites to fraudulent ones for the purpose of extracting**\nconfidential data. Type in an official website, instead of “linking” to it from an unsolicited source.\n\n#### Popular Virtual Currency Schemes\n\nIn 2014, virtual currency schemes reported to the IC3 more than doubled from the previous year. Bitcoin,\nLitecoin, and Peercoin, just to name a few, are popular types of virtual currencies, also known as CryptoCurrency, which can be used as an accepted form of payment at many online businesses. As this type of currency\nbecomes more popular, criminals have comprised new ways of capitalizing on this market, bilking millions of\ndollars from victims around the globe.\n\n\nI n t e r n e t C r i m e C o m p l a i n t C e n t e r Page 15\n\n\n-----\n\n_\"176573198 Copyright Julia Zakharova, 2015_\n_Used under license from Shutterstock.com\"_\n\n\nPopular crypto-currency scams reported to the IC3 in 2014:\n\n  - Victims not receiving their crypto-currency mining equipment or mining contracts after they paid for\nthem.  Crypto-Currency mining is the process of producing crypto or virtual currencies using computers.\nComputers are used to solve mathematical equations, generating crypto-coins.\n\n  - Victims sending high performance computers to crypto-mining datacenters to join others in a mining\npool, only to be scammed by the operators. The losses included damages to computers during transit,\nreceiving little or no crypto-coins from joining the datacenter pool, or having their computer stolen.\n\n  - Other victims have reported hacking of their virtual wallets, and then being blackmailed to get their\nmoney back.\n\nWith crypto-currency becoming more popular, users need to educate themselves to fully understand the risks of\nthis type of digital monetary system.\n\n#### Business E-mail Compromise\n\nThe Business E-mail Compromise is defined as a sophisticated scam targeting businesses working with foreign\nsuppliers and/or businesses which regularly perform wire transfer payments.\n\nThe IC3 began receiving complaints describing Business E-mail Compromise scams in 2010. Victims at the time\nidentified themselves as United States based businesses which had long term working relationships with Asian\nsuppliers. Victims were instructed through spoofed e-mails, intercepted facsimiles or telephone communications\nto change invoice remittance payments to fraudulent locations, usually banks located in Asia. The scam began to\nevolve in 2013 when victims indicated the e-mail accounts of Chief Executive Officers or Chief Financial Officers\nof a targeted business were hacked or spoofed, and wire payments were requested to be sent to fraudulent\nlocations, again usually in Asia. The Business E-mail Compromise scam continued to evolve, and in 2014, victim\nbusinesses reported having personal e-mails compromised and multiple fraudulent requests for payment sent to\nvendors identified from their contact list.\n\nBusiness E-mail Compromise is linked to other types of criminal activity including romance, lottery, employment,\nand check scams. Victims of these scams may be used to unknowingly transfer fraudulent funds on behalf of the\nperpetrators. In 2014, the IC3 received 2,417 Business E-mail Compromise complaints with a total reported loss of\n$226 million dollars.\n\n\nI n t e r n e t C r i m e C o m p l a i n t C e n t e r Page 16\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Operation Wellspring Initiative\n\nThe IC3 receives thousands of Internet related fraud\ncomplaints per month from the general public which\ndo not meet federal investigative thresholds. These\ncomplaints are archived in\nthe IC3 database and are\nexploited as a source of\n\n_of information and I always find additional_\n\nsignificant tactical and\nstrategic intelligence\nassociated with computer\nintrusions and other\nInternet-facilitated crimes. _aware of.

The pilot\nproject was named “Operation Wellspring.”\n\n\nThe Wellspring pilot was launched with the Salt\nLake City FBI Cyber Task Force in partnership with\nthe Utah Department of Safety. In 2014, Wellspring\n\nwas expanded to Dallas, TX\nand San Diego, CA.\n\nDuring 2014, the IC3\nprovided 40 referral\npackages to Wellspring\noffices with information\npertaining to 1,619 victims\nwith almost $3.8 million in\nlosses. There are currently\n15 open investigations as a\n\nSergeant Jeff Plank result of Operation\nUtah Department of Public Safety Wellspring and an\n\nadditional six potential\ncases were referred to\nstate/local law enforcement offices. The IC3 plans to\ninvite other field offices to participate based on the\ndemonstrated accomplishments of the pilot offices.\n\n\nI n t e r n e t C r i m e C o m p l a i n t C e n t e r Page 17\n\n\n-----\n\n#### IC3 Database Remote Access\n\nThe IC3 has expanded the remote search capabilities of the IC3 database by making it available to all sworn law\nenforcement through the FBI’s Law Enforcement Enterprise Portal (LEEP). LEEP is a gateway providing law\nenforcement agencies, intelligence groups, and criminal justice entities access to beneficial resources.\n\nThis web-based access provides users the ability to aggregate victims and losses to substantiate criminal activity\nwith the office’s area of jurisdiction, and to enhance the development of cases.\n\n\n_“I can tell you that I did find remote query very useful_\n_in identifying all complaints related to Indiana. On_\n_several occasions, I used a raw IC3 report to generate_\n_a finished intelligence product, which was then used_\n_to open an investigation”_\n\n_“I think over the past two years we opened at least 9_\n_cases off of IC3 reporting; in one instance it provided_\n_us an opportunity to use an investigative technique_\n_which resulted in the identification of a hacker_\n_located overseas”_\n\nBill Puller\nFBI Indianapolis\n\n\nI n t e r n e t C r i m e C o m p l a i n t C e n t e r Page 18\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nThroughout 2014, the IC3 supported law enforcement in their investigations of Internet-related crimes.\n\nThe IC3 used the 269,422 complaints received in 2014 for analysis, and extracted pertinent information to provide\nto law enforcement, produced intelligence reports, and published numerous scam alerts and PSAs. The IC3\ncontributed to the efforts of combating Internet crime by disseminating over 1,500 referrals to law enforcement\nagencies. Many of these referral packages included numerous complaints and covered a wide variety of Internet\nschemes.\n\nComplaints received and reviewed during 2014, revealed the growing impact social media has had on Internet\ncrime and the emergence of virtual currency transactions. Additionally, the Business E-mail Compromise scam\nemerged as being linked to a myriad of fraud schemes.\n\nThe IC3 focused on FBI Cyber Task Forces through Operation Wellspring and saw many successes in 2014.
