ISOMorph\nleverages HTML Smuggling to deliver malicious files to users’ endpoints by evading network\nsecurity solutions such as sandboxes and legacy proxies. Isolation prevents this attack from\ninfecting the endpoint. Here’s what we know:\n\n## Executive Summary\n\n[Data breaches, malware, ransomware,](https://www.menlosecurity.com/blog/why-ransomware-is-now-beyond-a-ciso-concern/) [phishing, and DDoS attacks are all on the rise. And](https://resources.menlosecurity.com/menlo-labs/phishing-attacks-are-scarily-easy-to-build)\n[now another type of attack is quickly emerging. Menlo Labs is seeing an uptick of attackers](https://www.menlosecurity.com/menlo-labs/)\nusing HTML Smuggling to get their malicious payloads to the endpoint. ISOMorph is one\nsuch campaign that is taking advantage of this technique on the heels of attacks by\nNobelium, the threat actor behind SolarWinds, who used the same technique in their most\nrecent spear-phishing campaign. Menlo Labs has identified malicious actors using the\npopular Discord app to host malicious payloads. The Remote Access Trojan (RAT) used in\nthis campaign (AsyncRAT) has many capabilities that are used to evade detection, log\npasswords, and exfiltrate data. An enterprise infected with this RAT must assume that the\ngoal of the attackers is exfiltration of sensitive data.\n\n\n-----\n\nHTML Smuggling, a technique that is fast gaining notoriety, is used to drop the firststage dropper—malware samples that initially land on a victim’s machine before\nfetching a main payload. HTML Smuggling was also used in the most recent spearphishing campaign by the Nobelium group.\nThe attack is multi-staged and checks and disables various anti-virus programs running\non the endpoint.\nAsyncRAT/NJRAT is the Remote Access Trojan that gets installed on successfully\ncompromised endpoints.\nBad actors are using the popular Discord app to host malicious payloads in this\ncampaign. This is important to note because Discord, a group chatting platform,\nreportedly has over 150 million active users who use the app to communicate over text\nand voice.\n\n**Why is HTML Smuggling re-emerging?**\n\nBeginning in 2020, when the world shifted to remote working, the browser became the place\nwhere work happens. “Even ahead of shelter-in-place and extensive work-from-home\ninitiatives, business users reported spending 75 percent of their workday either working in a\nweb browser or attending virtual meetings,” according to a Forrester study. HTML1\nSmuggling delivers malware by effectively bypassing various network security solutions,\nincluding sandboxes, legacy proxies, and firewalls. We believe attackers are using HTML\nSmuggling to deliver the payload to the endpoint because the browser is one of the weakest\nlinks, without network solutions to block the payload.\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\nLet’s start by providing a high-level overview diagram of the attack before we dig into the\ndetails. We’ve broken down the attack into sections, in accordance with the MITRE ATT&CK\nframework, to help detection and response teams easily incorporate these tactics,\ntechniques, and procedures (TTPs) into their frameworks.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Initial Access**\n\nMenlo Labs has seen attackers leverage HTML Smuggling using both email attachments\nand web drive-by downloads.\n\n**What is HTML Smuggling?**\n\nHTML Smuggling is a technique attackers use to construct the malicious payload\nprogrammatically on the HTML page using JavaScript, as opposed to making an HTTP\nrequest to fetch a resource on a web server. This technique is neither a vulnerability nor a\ndesign flaw in browser technologies, and web developers use this technique often to\noptimize file downloads.\n\n**How ISOMorph uses this technique**\n\nThe attackers behind ISOMorph use the following JavaScript code to construct the payload\ndirectly on the browser.\n\nIn a nutshell, the JavaScript code is creating an element “a,” setting the HREF to the blob\nand programmatically clicking it to trigger the download to the endpoint. Once the payload is\ndownloaded to the endpoint, the user must open it to execute the malicious code.\n\n## Execution\n\n\n-----\n\n**The first-stage payload**\n\nWhat gets downloaded to the endpoint is an ISO file. Why an ISO file? ISO files are disk\nimages that contain all the files/folders required to install software on endpoints. Attackers\nare always testing web and email gateway devices to see what file formats are exempt from\ninspection, then they incorporate those exempt file formats into their TTPs. ISO file formats\nare preferred by attackers because they do not require any third-party software to install.\n\nThe screenshot above shows the contents of the ISO file. While the screenshot above has a\nVBScript script, we have identified many different malicious scripts being used. The following\nis a list of all the malicious scripts that we observed embedded in the ISO file:\n\n\n-----\n\n1. Bills-19877733351.vbs\n2. Bills-bbt-89567815.vbs\n3. Spectrum (statement).vbs\n4. INVOICE-992771.vbs\n5. BBT-Invoice-71213241.DOCX.vbe\n6. Order_ConfirmationID717323644552844.js\n7. Order-ID693913086962206.vbs\n8. court .vbs\n\nOnce the VBScript script gets executed, it fetches additional PowerShell scripts. The\nfollowing flowchart details the actions resulting in the execution of the first-stage payload.\n\n**Achieving Persistence**\n\nISOMorph achieves persistence by first creating a Windows directory called “Microsoft\nArts\\Start” under “C:\\Program Data\\”. It then sets the registry key value under the “User Shell\nFolders” and “Shell Folders” to point to the directory previously created. The PowerShell\nscript then downloads a file called “Dicord.lnk” under the “C:\\Program Data\\Microsoft\nArts\\Start\\” directory. The figure below is a snippet of the PowerShell script that shows the\nvalues set to the registry keys, to enable the malicious code to execute on startup.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Defense Evasion**\n\nThe bad actors behind this campaign execute the malicious code by proxy, by injecting it into\nMSBuild.exe. MSBuild is a trusted process, so by injecting into MSBuild, application\nwhitelisting solutions are easily circumvented. The bad actors use reflection to load a DLL file\nin memory and inject the RAT payload into MSBuild.exe. Reflection enables developers to\nobtain information about loaded DLL files and the types defined within them, invoke\nmethods, etc. AV usually looks at any files with .dll extensions that get loaded by monitoring\nthe LoadLibrary API. By reflectively loading the DLL files and invoking certain methods,\n[malware authors can bypass AV software. This directly maps to the Technique T1127.001 in](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1127)\nthe MITRE ATT&CK framework.\n\n**Command and Control**\n\nAs seen from the previous step, a method (WpfControlLibary1.LOGO.hahaha) in the .NET\nRAT payload is called to start the AsyncRAT functionality. AsyncRAT encrypts its config using\nAES, as seen below.\n\nThe Base64 strings are the encrypted config for the RAT. Upon decryption using the\nhardcoded AES key, we can see the CnC server host/port, version, and other settings for the\nRAT.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Threat Actor and Campaign Information**\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the campaign we’ve been tracking on VirusTotal. This campaign is\n[available to the public.](https://www.virustotal.com/graph/embed/g0ed7d7222a764ea4a78fdbb325f09facfa674f79a6214451b1d97a3d9d453e6d)\n\n[NJRAT/AsyncRAT is the Remote Access Trojan that gets dropped to the endpoint. While this](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0385/)\nRAT family has been used by many different actors over the years, it was predominantly\nused to compromise high-value targets in the Middle East. While these groups have used the\nRAT, it does not mean that these groups are behind this specific campaign.\n\nThe following groups have been known to use NJRAT:\n\n\n-----\n\n[G0078](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0078) [Gorgon Group](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0078) [[5]](https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2018/08/unit42-gorgon-group-slithering-nation-state-cybercrime/)\n\n[G0043](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0043) [Group5](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0043) [[4]](https://citizenlab.ca/2016/08/group5-syria/)\n\n[G0096](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0096) [APT41](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0096) [[6]](https://content.fireeye.com/apt-41/rpt-apt41)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAttackers are constantly testing out newer methods to get their payloads to the endpoint.\nMenlo Labs has noticed an increase in bad actors using HTML Smuggling for their initial\naccess. This technique is gaining popularity because attackers can get their payloads to the\nendpoint while bypassing all network inspection and analysis tools. Also, since the payload is\nconstructed directly on the browser, there is a gap in logging and visibility for SIEM and EDR\ntools. Menlo Labs strongly believes that knowing and understanding the initial access\nmethods is critical to a strong prevention, detection, and response strategy, and we are\ndetermined to plug that gaping hole.\n\n_1.
