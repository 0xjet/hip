We felt it was significant to highlight the previous PIVY\ncampaigns to:\n\nDemonstrate that any large-scale, targeted attacks utilizing this off-the-shelf Remote\nAccess Tool (RAT) shouldn’t be automatically linked to Chinese threat actors.\n\nShare several documented tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP), and indicators of\ncompromise (IOC) for identifying Molerats activity.\nHowever, this was just one unique facet to a much broader series of related attacks dating\nback to as early as October 2011 and are still ongoing. Previous research has linked these\ncampaigns to Molerats, but with so much public attention focused on APT threat actors\nbased in China, it’s easy to lose track of targeted attacks carried out by other threat actor\n\n\n-----\n\n[groups based elsewhere. For example, we recently published the Operation Saffron Rose](https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/global/en/current-threats/pdfs/rpt-operation-saffron-rose.pdf)\nwhitepaper, detailing a rapidly evolving Iranian-based threat actor group known as the “Ajax\nSecurity Team.\"\n\n**New Attacks, Same Old Tactics**\n\nWith the reuse of command and control (CnC) infrastructure and a similar set of TTPs,\nMolerats activity has been tracked and expanded to a growing\ntarget list, which includes:\n\nPalestinian and Israeli surveillance targets\nGovernment departments in Israel, Turkey, Slovenia,\nMacedonia, New Zealand, Latvia, the U.S., and the UK\nThe Office of the Quartet Representative\nThe British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)\nA major U.S. financial institution\nMultiple European government organizations\n\nPrevious Molerats campaigns have used several garden-variety, freely available backdoors\nsuch as CyberGate and Bifrost, but, most recently, we have observed them making use of\nthe PIVY and Xtreme RATs. Previous campaigns made use of at least one of three observed\nforged Microsoft certificates, allowing security researchers to accurately tie together separate\nattacks even if the attacks used different backdoors. There also appears to be a habitual use\nof lures or decoy documents – in either English or Arabic-language – with content focusing\non active conflicts in the Middle East. The lures come packaged with malicious files that\ndrop the Molerats’ flavor of the week, which happen to all be Xtreme RAT binaries in these\nmost recent campaigns.\n\n**Groundhog Day**\n\nOn 27 May we observed at least one victim downloading a malicious .ZIP file as the result of\nclicking on a shortened Google URL – http://goo[.]gl[/]AMD3yX – likely contained inside of a\ntargeted spearphishing email. However, we were unable to confirm for this particular victim:\n\n**1) “ﺣﺼﺮي ﺑﺎﻟﺼﻮر ﻟﺤﻈﺔ اﻹﻋﺘﺪاء ﻋﻠﻰ اﻟﻤﺸﯿﺮ ﻋﺒﺪ اﻟﻔﺘﺎح اﻟﺴﯿﺴﻲ.scr” (MD5:**\n**a6a839438d35f503dfebc6c5eec4330e)**\n\n\n-----\n\nMalicious download URL was sent to a well-known European government organization.\nThe shortened URL breaks out to “http://lovegame[.]us/ Photos[.]zip,” which was\nclicked/downloaded by the victim.\nThe extracted binary, “ﺣﺼﺮي ﺑﺎﻟﺼﻮر ﻟﺤﻈﺔ اﻹﻋﺘﺪاء ﻋﻠﻰ اﻟﻤﺸﯿﺮ ﻋﺒﺪ اﻟﻔﺘﺎح اﻟﺴﯿﺴﻲ.scr,” opens up a\ndecoy Word document and installs/executes the Xtreme RAT binary into a temp\ndirectory, “Documents and Settings\\admin\\Local Settings\\Temp\\Chrome.exe.”\nThe decoy document, “rotab.doc,” contains three images (a political cartoon and two\nedited photos), all negatively depicting former military chief Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.\nXtreme RAT binary dropped: “Chrome.exe” (MD5:\na90225a88ee974453b93ee7f0d93b104), which is unsigned.\nAs of 29 May, the URL has been clicked 225 times by a variety of platforms and\nbrowser types, so the campaign was likely not limited to just one victim.\nTwo of the download referrers are webmail providers (EIM.ae” and “Sltnet.lk”) further\nindicating the malicious URL was likely disseminated via spearphishing emails.\n\nOn 29 April we observed two unique malicious attachments being sent to two different\nvictims via spearphishing emails:\n\n**2) 8ca915ab1d69a7007237eb83ae37eae5**\n\nMalicious file sent to both the financial institution and\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs targets.\nDrops an Arabic language decoy document titled\n“Sisi.doc”, which appears to contain several copy/pasted\nexcerpts of (now retired) Egyptian Major General\nHossam Sweilem, discussing military strategy and the\nMuslim Brotherhood.\nThe title of the document appears to have several Chinese characters, yet the entire\nbody of the document is written in Arabic. As noted in our August 2013 blog post, this\ncould possibly be a poor attempt to frame China-based threat actors for these attacks.\nXtreme RAT binary dropped: “sky.exe” (MD5: 2d843b8452b5e48acbbe869e51337993),\nwhich is unsigned.\n\n\n-----\n\n**3) Too soon to embrace Sisi _ Egypt is an unpredictable place.scr (MD5:**\n**7f9c06cd950239841378f74bbacbef60)**\n\nMalicious file only sent to a European government organization.\nDrops an English language decoy document also titled “Sisi.doc”, however this one\nappears to be an exact copy of a 23 April Financial Times’ news article about the\nuncertainties surrounding former military chief Abdel Fattah el-Sisi running for president\nin the upcoming Egyptian elections.\nDrops the same Xtreme RAT binary: “sky.exe” (MD5:\n2d843b8452b5e48acbbe869e51337993), which is unsigned.\n\nAnother attribute regularly exhibited by Molerats malware samples are that they are often\narchived inside of self-extracting RAR files and encoded with EXECryptor V2.2, along with\nseveral other legitimate looking archived files.\n\n**Related Samples**\n\nBoth of the malicious files above have a compile date/time of 2014-04-17 09:43:29-0000,\nand, based on this information, we were able to identify five additional samples (one sample\nonly contained a lure but no malicious binary), related to the 29 April attacks. These samples\nwere a little more interesting, because they contained an array of either attempted forged or\nself-signed Authenticode certificates.\n\nAll of the additionally identified samples were sent to one of the same European government\norganizations mentioned previously.\n\n**4) 2b0f8a8d8249402be0d83aedd9073662**\n\nDrops an Arabic language Word Document titled “list.doc”.\nThe title of the document appears to have several Chinese\ncharacters, yet the entire body of the document is written in\nArabic.\nXtreme RAT binary dropped: “Download.exe” (MD5:\ncff48ff88c81795ee8cebdc3306605d0). This malware is\nsigned with a self-signed certificate issued by “FireZilla”\n(see below).Certificate serial number: {75 dd 9b 14 c6 6e 20\n0b 2e 22 95 3a 62 7b 39 19}.\n\n\n-----\n\nForged FireZilla certificate\n\n**5) 4f170683ae19b5eabcc54a578f2b530b**\n\nDrops an Arabic language Word Document titled\n“points.doc,” which appears to be an online clipping\nfrom a news article about ongoing Palestinian\nreconciliation meetings between Fatah and Hamas in\nthe Gaza strip.\nThe title of the document appears to have several\nChinese characters, yet the entire body of the\ndocument is written in Arabic.\nXtreme RAT binary dropped: “VBB.exe” (MD5:\n6f9585c8748cd0e7103eab4eda233666). Though the malware appeared to be signed\nwith a certificate named “Kaspersky Lab”, the real hash did not match the signed hash\n(see below).Certificate serial number: {a7 ed a5 a2 15 c0 d1 91 32 9a 1c a4 b0 53 eb\n18}.\n\n(Forged Kaspersky Lab certificate)\n\n**6) 793b7340b7c713e79518776f5710e9dd & a75281ee9c7c365a776ce8d2b11d28da**\n\n\n-----\n\nBoth drop an Arabic language Word Document titled\n“qatar.doc,” which appears to be an online clipping for\na new article concerning members of the Gulf\nCooperation Council (GCC) and the ongoing conflicts\nbetween Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates\n(UAE), and Bahrain – all against Qatar because of the\ncountry’s support for the Muslim Brotherhood.\nThe title of the document appears to have several\nChinese characters, yet the entire body of the\ndocument is written in Arabic.\nXtreme RAT binary dropped by the first sample: “AVG.exe” (MD5:\na51da465920589253bf32c6115072909), which is unsigned.\n\n**7) Pivoting off one of the fake Authenticode certificates we were able to identify at least one**\nadditional related binary, “vmware.exe” (MD5: 6be46a719b962792fd8f453914a87d3e), also\nXtreme RAT, but doesn’t appear to have been sent to any of our customers. The malicious\nbinary is also encoded with EXECryptor V2.2–similar to the samples above–and the CnC\ndomain has resolved to IPs that overlap with previously identified Molerats malware.\n\n**Indicators of Compromise**\n\nAlthough the samples above are all Xtreme RAT, all but two samples communicate over\ndifferent TCP ports. The port 443 callback listed in the last sample is also not using actual\nSSL, but instead, the sample transmits communications in clear-text – a common tactic\nemployed by adversaries to try and bypass firewall/proxy rules applying to communications\nover traditional web ports. These tactics, among several others mentioned previously, seem\nto indicate that Molerats are not only aware of security researchers’ efforts in trying to track\nthem but are also attempting to avoid using any obvious, repeating patterns that could be\nused to more easily track endpoints infected with their malware.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n\n-----\n\nAlthough a large number of attacks against our customers appear to originate from China,\nwe are tracking lesser-known actors also targeting the same firms. Molerats campaigns\nseem to be limited to only using freely available malware; however, their growing list of\ntargets and increasingly evolving techniques in subsequent campaigns are certainly\nnoteworthy.\n\n**MD5 Samples**\n\na6a839438d35f503dfebc6c5eec4330e\n7f9c06cd950239841378f74bbacbef60\n8ca915ab1d69a7007237eb83ae37eae5\n2b0f8a8d8249402be0d83aedd9073662\n4f170683ae19b5eabcc54a578f2b530b\n793b7340b7c713e79518776f5710e9dd\na75281ee9c7c365a776ce8d2b11d28da\n6be46a719b962792fd8f453914a87d3e\n\n**Older Molerats samples from Dec 2013 (not listed above)**\n\n34c5e6b2a988076035e47d1f74319e86\n13e351c327579fee7c2b975b17ef377c\nc0488b48d6aabe828a76ae427bd36cf1\n14d83f01ecf644dc29302b95542c9d35\n\n**References & Credits**\n\nA special thanks to Ned Moran and Matt Briggs of FireEye Labs for supporting this research.\n\nhttps://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2013/08/operation-molerats-middle-eastcyber-attacks-using-poison-ivy.html\nhttp://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/new-xtreme-rat-attacks-onusisrael-and-other-foreign-governments/\nhttp://cyber-peace.org/wpcontent/uploads/2014/01/Cyberattack_against_Israeli_and_Palestinian_targets.pdf\n\n\n-----",
