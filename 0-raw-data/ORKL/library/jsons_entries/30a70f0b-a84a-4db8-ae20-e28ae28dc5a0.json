The actor utilizes spear phishing campaigns to deliver NetTraveler, also known as TravNet. First\nobserved as early as 2004, NetTraveler is a Trojan used widely in targeted attacks. We believe that this attacker\noperates out of China. In addition to Russia, targeted regions include neighboring countries such as Mongolia, Belarus,\nand other European countries. The spear-phishing campaigns we detected use links to RAR-compressed executables\n[and Microsoft Word attachments that exploit the CVE-2012-0158 vulnerability.](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2012-0158)\n\nThis particular APT is targeting organizations that include weapons manufacturers, human rights activists, and prodemocracy groups, among others.\n\n**Background**\n\n[Previously we described activity by the same actor “In Pursuit of Optical Fibers and Troop Intel” [2] in which this group](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/PlugX-in-Russia)\nutilized PlugX malware to target various telecommunication and military interests in Russia. Since January 2016, this\ngroup switched to using NetTraveler and varied its targets, but otherwise left most of its tools, techniques, and\nprocedures (TTPs) unchanged. It is worth noting that this and other China-based espionage groups have reduced their\nreliance on PlugX for unknown reasons, with only a few major incidents involving PlugX this year [5].\n\nMoreover, there are some indications that this or a closely related group utilized Saker, Netbot, DarkStRat, and LURK0\nGh0st in its espionage activities. We previously mentioned this in our 2015 publication on PlugX. Palo Alto Networks\n[also demonstrated links via tools and infrastructure used in these attacks in their MNKit [4] research, as did Kaspersky](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/01/nettraveler-spear-phishing-email-targets-diplomat-of-uzbekistan/)\n\n[1] and ESET [3] in their respective publications.\n\n**Spear-Phishing**\n\nOne of this actor's favorite techniques is to register news and military lookalike sites and use them for Command and\nControl (C&C) and for payload hosting. Days prior to launching a wave of spear-phishing, the actor selects a victimrelevant news topic such as nuclear energy, military training, or geopolitics. The actor then finds a news article on the\ntopic and uses it as a basis for the phishing lure, including file names, relevant decoy documents, image files, and email\ncontent.\n\nFor example, the actor emailed the URL www.info-spb[.]com/analiz/voennye_kommentaria/n148584.rar to potential\nvictims in early February. The URL links to a RAR file which contains the executable “Нападение на американские\nкосмические системы очень дорого обойдется.scr” (“Attacking the American space systems will be very costly.scr”)\nand two benign decoy documents. One of these documents is shown in Figure 1 below:\n\nnettraveler-fig1.png\n\n_Figure 1: One of the decoy documents, “Новый щит и новый меч Вооруженные Силы России и США.doc” (“New_\n_Shield and Sword Armed forces of Russia and USA.doc”)_\n\nFigure 2 shows the legitimate news story that served as the basis for the spear-phishing lure.\n\nnettraveler-fig2.png\n\n_Figure 2: The decoy document copies the text of this legitimate news article that describes new Russian ICBMs [9]_\n\nThe RAR archives hosted on look-alike domains always contain RAR SFX-packaged executables that drop and load\nNetTraveler. A sampling of the various filenames used for executables is provided below:\n\n**Indicators of Compromise (IOC)**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Embedded Filename** **Translation**\n\nСервисное обслуживание и ремонт военной техники связи.scr Service and repair of military communication\nequipment.scr\n\n\nНападение на американские космические системы очень\nдорого обойдется.scr\n\n\nAttacking american space systems will be\ncostly.scr\n\n\nТекст приветствия Главы государства.scr Text of speech of head of state.scr\n\n\nПятнадцатое заседание Коллегии Евразийской\nэкономической комиссии.scr\n\nСовместное антитеррористическое учение\n«Антитеррор-2016».scr\n\n\nFifteenth session of Eurasian economic\ncommission.scr\n\nJoint anti-terrorism training “Antiterror\n2016”.scr\n\n\nВстреча НГШ с Бордюжа.scr Meeting of Chief of General Staff with\nBordyuzh.scr\n\n\nИзменения в списке аффилированных лиц по состоянию на\n20.04.2016 г.scr\n\n\nChanges to the list of affiliated persons for\n20.04.2016.scr\n\n\n_Table 1: File names of executables inside RAR archives and their English translations_\n\nIn some cases, instead of sending URLs in the spear-phishing emails, the attackers sent Microsoft Word attachments\nutilizing CVE-2012-0158 to exploit the client and install NetTraveler. These documents were built with MNKit, described\nin detail here [4][6]. For example, the attachment “ПЛАН РЕАЛИЗАЦИИ ПРОЕКТА.doc” (which translates to “Plan of\nrealization of project.doc”) was sent to potential victims in January 2016. As shown in Figure 3, various builder artifacts\nare visible in the document indicating the use of a builder.\n\nnettraveler-fig3.png\n\n_Figure 3: MNKit builder artifacts in the exploit document, including a LastAuthor value of “User123”_\n\n**Other Targeted Countries**\n\nBesides targeting Russia with NetTraveler, the actor also appears to have interests in Mongolia. While we do not have\nspear-phishing emails for these samples, we found certain payloads using Mongolian lures and decoys. For example,\nthe file 13_11.rar found on March 11 contains a NetTraveler payload with a Mongolian file name “НИЙГМИЙН\nДААТГАЛЫН ЕРӨНХИЙ ГАЗАР.exe” (“Social Insurance General Gazar.exe”) and a decoy PDF file with the same\nname. The C&C for this sample, www.mogoogle[.]com, resolved to the IP address 103.231.184[.]164, where the last\noctet of the IP is only 1 number larger than the IP address used for NetTraveler payloads with Russian targeting.\n\nnettraveler-fig4.png\n\n_Figure 4: Decoy PDF used with the Mongolian-targeting NetTraveler payload_\n\nAnother sample found April 20 with a Russian filename “Главный редактор Sputnik–Турция в среду вернется в\nМоскву.rar” (“Main editor of Sputnik-Turkey will return to Moscow on Wednesday.doc.scr”) containing a NetTraveler\npayload with a decoy JPG file. The image file is a picture of a Turkish-language “Unacceptable forms of passenger\ninformation” form. This sample reuses the C&C domain www.mogoogle[.]com. The decoy in this sample was based on\n\n\n-----\n\nan RIA (a Russian language news agency) news article that appeared on the same day describing how the editor for\nthe Turkish branch of a major Russian news source, Sputnik, was not allowed to enter Turkey during the height of the\nRussia-Turkey plane-downing dispute [7]. This payload could have been sent to Russian or Turkish individuals.\n\nnettraveler-fig5.png\n\n_Figure 5: Decoy JPG used with the Russia/Turkey NetTraveler payload_\n\nAnother sample found on March 13 included a Russian file name “Совместное антитеррористическое учение\n«Антитеррор-2016».rar” (“Joint anti-terrorism training “Antiterror 2016”.scr”) and contains a NetTraveler payload with\nC&C www.voennovosti[.]com. The file name for this sample capitalizes on a Belarusian news article [8] describing antiterror exercises in Minsk, Belarus, by participating Commonwealth of Independent States countries (CIS). This payload\ncould have been sent to a national of participating countries such as Belarus, Russia, or Ukraine.\n\n**Infrastructure**\n\nThe following table summarizes the C&C and payload hosting domains used throughout the year.\n\n**Infection Site** **Registrant Email** **Legitimate Site Mimicked**\n\nwww.tassnews[.]net ghjksd@gmail.com tass.ru (Major Russian news agency)\n\nwww.interfaxru[.]com ganh@gmail.com www.interfax.ru (Russian non-government news agency)\n\nwww.riaru[.]net fjknge@yahoo.com Ria.ru (State-operated domestic Russian news agency)\n\nwww.voennovosti[.]com ukdf@gmail.com voennovosti.ru (Military news of Russia)\n\nwww.info-spb[.]com kefj0943@yahoo.com Unknown (Possibly an acronym for St. Petersburg, a major city\nin Russia)\n\nwww.mogoogle[.]com rubiya@163.com Unknown (Possibly a word combination of Mongolia and Google)\n\nAll the domains (except mogoogle[.]com) were set up with the same registrar in Beijing referred to as “Shanghai\nMeicheng Technology Information Development Co., Ltd.”. Other than the emails, information used for registration was\nrandomized. On the infrastructure side, the similarities to the 2015 PlugX campaign we described in “In Pursuit of\nOptical Fibers and Troop Intel: Targeted Attack Distributes PlugX in Russia” include:\n\nRegistration using “Shanghai Meicheng Technology Information Development Co., Ltd.”\nUse of 4 - 6 letter Yahoo or Gmail registrant accounts\nUse of fake C&C domains that mimic major news sites or military forums\nIP address 98.126.38[.]107 resolved to domains used in both 2015 (including patriotp[.]com) and 2016 campaigns\n(such as www.voennovosti[.]com)\n\n**NetTraveler Analysis**\n\nNetTraveler implants continue to use a DLL side-loading technique. The payloads described here used the clean,\nsigned executable fsguidll.exe (F-secure GUI component) to sideload fslapi.dll or the clean, signed executable\nRasTls.exe to sideload rastls.dll.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe configuration file used by NetTraveler uses a known format. For example, the payload dropped by 20160623.doc\n(See IOC table) uses the following configuration, where U00P is a C&C server, K00P is a DES key composed of a\nstring of repeated As, P00D is sleep time, and F00G is proxy setting. U00P and K00P are encrypted in the file using a\nsimple algorithm. These values are contained in the dropped config.dat file. Additionally, MM1 through MM6 parameters\n(not shown below) are added after installation.\n\n[OOOOOO]\n\nU00P=hxxp://www.tassnews[.]net/revenge/dk/downloader.asp\n\nK00P=AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\n\nP00D=5\n\nF00G=True\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThreat actors have been successfully using NetTraveler for cyber-espionage for over 10 years. Targets have ranged\nfrom government agencies to nuclear power installations. In this case, it appears that Chinese actors are targeting a\nvariety of interests in Russia and neighboring countries, relying on spear-phishing attacks to drop NetTraveler on\nvulnerable machines. Regardless of the TTPs, this ongoing APT points to the staying power of NetTraveler and the\n[need for ongoing vigilance and technological protections against advanced persistent threats. Even organizations](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-reference/advanced-persistent-threat)\nwithout direct government ties are potential targets for these types of attacks as smaller agencies or contractors can\nserve as beachheads in larger campaigns against indirectly related targets.\n\n**References**\n\n[1] https://securelist.com/blog/research/35936/nettraveler-is-running-red-star-apt-attacks-compromise-high-profilevictims/\n\n[2] [https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/PlugX-in-Russia](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/PlugX-in-Russia)\n\n[3] [http://www.welivesecurity.com/2014/11/12/korplug-military-targeted-attacks-afghanistan-tajikistan/](http://www.welivesecurity.com/2014/11/12/korplug-military-targeted-attacks-afghanistan-tajikistan/)\n\n[4] http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/06/unit42-recent-mnkit-exploit-activity-reveals-some-commonthreads/\n\n[5] [http://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Companies/Known-virus-linked-to-China-behind-JTB-data-breach](http://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Companies/Known-virus-linked-to-China-behind-JTB-data-breach)\n\n[6] https://www.sophos.com/en-us/medialibrary/PDFs/technical%20papers/sophos-office-exploit-generatorsszappanos.pdf\n\n[7] [http://ria.ru/world/20160420/1415455030.html](http://ria.ru/world/20160420/1415455030.html)\n\n[8] [http://sputnik.by/defense_safety/20160524/1022738965.html](http://sputnik.by/defense_safety/20160524/1022738965.html)\n\n[9] [http://army-news.ru/2015/01/novyj-shhit-i-novyj-mech/](http://army-news.ru/2015/01/novyj-shhit-i-novyj-mech/)\n\n**Indicators of Compromise (IOC)**\n\n**IOC** **IOC Type** **Description**\n\nwww.interfaxru[.]com Hostname NetTraveler C&C and\npayload hosting site\n\n\n-----\n\nwww.info-spb[.]com Hostname NetTraveler C&C and\npayload hosting site\n\nwww.tassnews[.]net Hostname NetTraveler C&C\n\nwww.riaru[.]net Hostname NetTraveler C&C\n\nwww.voennovosti[.]com Hostname NetTraveler C&C\n\nwww.mogoogle[.]com Hostname NetTraveler C&C\n\n103.231.184[.]164 IP NetTraveler C&C\n\n103.231.184[.]163 IP NetTraveler C&C\n\n98.126.38[.]107 IP NetTraveler C&C\n\nhxxp://www.interfaxru[.]com/html/rostechnologii/20160420.rar URL NetTraveler payload\nURL\n\nhxxp://www.info-spb[.]com/analiz/voennye_kommentaria/n148584.rar URL NetTraveler payload\nURL\n\nhxxp://www.info-spb[.]com/html/news/cout/Последний%20доклад.rar URL NetTraveler payload\nURL\n\nhxxp://www.info-spb[.]com//worldnews/almaz-antey/no.15.02.2016.rar URL NetTraveler payload\nURL\n\nhxxp://www.info-spb[.]com/worldnews/mfa/ua/2016-02-16.zip URL NetTraveler payload\nURL\n\nhxxp://www.info-spb[.]com/worldnews/mfa/uz/03.02.2016.rar URL NetTraveler payload\nURL\n\n5afcaca6f6dd6fb3bad26585f30870f71462c59e251cc76b0df5851ac2aa17de SHA256 20160420.rar\n\n67c994ad328cd3d8b954366b2baa5e643b31ed42280548eebbd0c30c53f9e37d SHA256 Информация о\nперечне зон\nдеятельности сетевой\nорганизации в 2016\nг.rar\n\nf3997f8269e4177342aec8816c28cfebaef17a86f22eef15d90b4f9e5b15d8e6 SHA256 20160330.rar\n\n69527b0471c2effab2d21106556ace6bd501daf7758b2ebbf3b2780d6399ecbf SHA256 Совместное\nантитеррористическое\nучение\n«Антитеррор-2016».rar\n\n\n-----\n\n8e3e5b12f0964e73e4057610ce7a6aa25607c94536762128dabebf9ccfa667d4 SHA256 13_11.rar\n\n1bcafa596c597868a179fe3d783b8c5bcd1b487d891b99cb90e76e8abd55a599 SHA256 Главный редактор\nSputnik–Турция в\nсреду вернется в\nМоскву.rar\n\n409bb7f9faf4b7dc168f71084edb695707f22a83a2e79b810a0b4a27966d78f1 SHA256 Текст приветствия\nГлавы государства.rar\n\n3adacca54c6fe4bb905e233e48dffd8f6d03078d3d2d309d40e2e67a04a70db1 SHA256 n148584.rar\n\n80ba8997067025dd830d49d09c57c0dcb1e2f303fa0e093069bd9cff29420692 SHA256 20160623.doc\n\n60386112fc4b0ddb833fc9a877a9a4f0fe76828ebab4457637b0827106b269fe SHA256 20160607.doc\n\nb3a5c562e3531fb8be476af4947eaa793a77cc61715284bfb9c380b7048da44a SHA256 ПЛАН РЕАЛИЗАЦИИ\nПРОЕКТА.doc\n\n_Select ET Signatures that would fire on such traffic:_\n\n2816649 || ETPRO TROJAN Win32.TravNet.C HTTP Checkin\n\nSubscribe to the Proofpoint Blog\n\n\n-----",
