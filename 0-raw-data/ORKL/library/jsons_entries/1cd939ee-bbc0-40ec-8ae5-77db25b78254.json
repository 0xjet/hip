    "plain_text": "# Pro-PRC “HaiEnergy” Information Operations Campaign Leverages Infrastructure from Public Relations Firm to Disseminate Content on Inauthentic News Sites\n\n**[mandiant.com/resources/pro-prc-information-operations-campaign-haienergy](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/pro-prc-information-operations-campaign-haienergy)**\n\nMandiant has identified an ongoing information operations (IO) campaign leveraging a\nnetwork of at least 72 suspected inauthentic news sites and a number of suspected\ninauthentic social media assets to disseminate content strategically aligned with the political\ninterests of the People’s Republic of China (PRC). The sites present themselves primarily as\nindependent news outlets from different regions across the world and publish content in 11\nlanguages (see Appendix). Based on technical indicators we detail in this blog, we believe\nthese sites are linked to Shanghai Haixun Technology Co., Ltd (上海海讯社科技有限公司), a\nChinese public relations (PR) firm (referred to hereafter as “Haixun”).\n\nNarratives promoted by the campaign criticize the U.S. and its allies, attempt to reshape the\ninternational image of Xinjiang due to mounting international scrutiny, and express support\nfor the reform of Hong Kong’s electoral system—a change which gave the PRC more power\nover vetting local candidates. In addition to these broader themes, the campaign leveraged\nfabricated content designed to discredit opponents who have been critical of the Chinese\nGovernment, including Chinese businessman Guo Wengui (Miles Kwok) and German\nanthropologist Adrian Zenz—known for his research on Xinjiang—and China’s reported\ngenocide against the Uyghur population.\n\n\n-----\n\nGiven the distinctive tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) employed by this campaign,\nwe are classifying this activity set as its own campaign, which we have dubbed\n“HaiEnergy”—stemming from the campaign’s use of infrastructure attributed to Haixun and\nservices advertised by the PR firm as “positive energy packages.” Notably, the term “positive\nenergy” (正能量) is an important term in the Xi Jinping era that refers to messages positively\nportraying the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), the Chinese Government, and its policies.\n\nDespite the capabilities and global reach of this campaign, there is at least some evidence to\nsuggest that HaiEnergy failed to generate substantial engagement outside of the inauthentic\namplification that we have identified—a limitation we also noted in our recent public reporting\non DRAGONBRIDGE. We find the campaign’s use of infrastructure linked to Haixun to be\nmore interesting, as it is suggestive of recent trends surrounding the outsourcing of IO to\nthird parties, which can make IO more accessible and help obfuscate the identities of an\nactor.\n\n## Infrastructure Linked to Shanghai Haixun Technology Co., Ltd (上海 海讯社科技有限公司)\n\nBased on information from public descriptions of the company’s services, Haixun offers\ncontent creation and marketing services in at least 40 different languages in over 100\ncountries. Among their most notable offerings are the “Europe and U.S. Positive Energy”\npackage, which includes content creation ostensibly geared towards English-speaking\naudiences, and the “Positive Energy Project Edition,” which focuses on the production of\ntailor-made videos, promotion of custom content through “high-quality media resources,” and\ncampaign impact monitoring (Figure 1).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1: Haixun website offers a variety of “packages,” including Positive Energy\nWhile we do not currently have sufficient evidence to determine the extent to which Haixun is\ninvolved in, or even aware of HaiEnergy, our analysis indicates that the campaign has at\nleast leveraged services and infrastructure belonging to Haixun to host and distribute\ncontent. In total, we identified 72 websites (59 domains and 13 subdomains) hosted by\nHaixun, which were used to target audiences in North America, Europe, the Middle East, and\nAsia.\n\n\n-----\n\nSites attributed to HaiEnergy all display images and videos that are hosted on the\nserver 02100.vip, which is registered by Haixun (Figure 2). Based on infrastructure\noverlap, we identified two additional domains (haixunpr.com and haixunpr.org)—\nChinese- and English-language sites describing Haixun’s services—that have resolved\nto the same IP address and leveraged content from 02100.vip.\nWe observed multiple inauthentic news sites we attribute to “HaiEnergy” listed in a\ndownloadable spreadsheet hosted at haixunpr.org. The spreadsheet features Chinese\nand Russian text and appears to be a distribution list for content (Figure 3). We note\nthat the spreadsheet is no longer available to download as of the date of this\npublication.\n\nFigure 2: Example site in network, Unseenews.com, displays content hosted on 02100.vip\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3: Spreadsheet previously available to download under haixunpr.org displays some of\nthe sites we judge to be part of the network in Russian and Chinese\n_Websites Exhibit Signs of Coordination_\n\nTo date, HaiEnergy has exclusively leveraged Haixun infrastructure to host websites. These\nwebsites possess a number of similarities and exhibit notable signs of coordination,\nincluding:\n\nNearly all sites, including those presenting themselves as English-language U.S. news\noutlets, are built with a Chinese-language HTML template (Figure 4).\nSeveral of the websites that include both a domain and subdomain present themselves\nas different, independent sites. For example, the domain trademarksdaily.com presents\nitself as the English-language site “TMK Daily,” whereas the subdomain\nautomobile.tradesmarksdaily.com presents itself as “Focus on Russia” and contains\nRussian-language content (Figure 5).\nMany of the sites link directly to other sites in the network, typically at the bottom of\ntheir pages. Additionally, sites commonly link to other news outlets related to their\nstated regional focus.\n\n\n-----\n\nIdentical political and apolitical articles are often published across multiple websites,\nincluding articles appropriated from other sources (e.g., Chinese and Russian statecontrolled media outlets).\n\nFigure 4: Example site in network, 24usnews.com, is built with Chinese-language HTML\ntemplate\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5: Domain trademarksdaily.com presents as “TMK Daily” (top) in English; subdomain\nautomobile.trademarksdaily.com presents as “Focus on Russia” in Russia (bottom)\n\n### Campaign Leverages Social Media Assets from Sites and Author Personas to Disseminate Content\n\nThe campaign also leveraged a small number of social media accounts across multiple\nplatforms to disseminate content. Observed assets included personas presented as being\naffiliated with HaiEnergy’s inauthentic news sites, author personas allegedly responsible for\nthe content itself, and accounts that promote campaign content, but do not self-affiliate with\n\n\n-----\n\nthe sites. In some cases, accounts that we identified and assessed to be part of the\ncampaign featured bios that displayed the text “I do paid promos,” raising the possibility that\nthe pro-PRC content may have been commissioned.\n\nNotably, many of the sites we identified have published articles with author bylines directly\nlinking to Facebook accounts that we judge to be leveraged in this campaign. For example,\nthe site inspectnews.com published content by an author listed as “Julian Sontagg,” which\ndirectly links to the Facebook account “I trust in memes” (@TrustingMemes) in Sontagg’s\nbyline (Figure 6).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6: Author persona “Julian Sonntag” on inspectnews.com (top) links to “I trust in\nmemes” Facebook account, which posts identical content (bottom)\n\n### Pro-PRC Content and Narratives Promoted by Campaign Assets\n\nContent promoted by the campaign includes efforts to reshape the international image of\nXinjiang, criticism of the U.S. and its allies, and attempts to discredit critics of the PRC\ngovernment.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Efforts to Reshape International Image of Xinjiang_\n\nWe observed efforts to smear anthropologist Adrian Zenz—known for his research on\nXinjiang and China’s reported genocide against the Uyghur population—through website\narticles and social media posts featuring what we suspect to be at least three fabricated\nletters based on obvious grammatical errors and typos (Figure 7).\n\nA now-suspended Twitter account belonging to a suspected inauthentic persona\n“Jonas Drosten” (@Jonas_drosten), posted a tweet containing images of three letters.\nThe tweet and one of the letters alleged that Zenz received financial support from U.S.\nSenator Marco Rubio and former White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon (Figure\n7). The other two letters implied that the financial support came from grants awarded to\nZenz from the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation in 2020 and 2021.\n\nWe observed this persona mentioned in an article published by the Chinese stateaffiliated media outlet China Daily on May 24, 2022 titled “Rumormongers’ agenda in\nfabricating lies about Xinjiang,” which claimed that Zenz received funds illicitly from an\nunknown source connected to former White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon to\n“fabricate Xinjiang stories.” Several websites and other social media accounts in this\ncampaign promoted the same letters and mentioned the Jonas Drosten Twitter\npersona.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7: Jonas Drosten persona’s Twitter account (top left) posts fabricated letter allegedly\nsigned by Marco Rubio (top right); Swiss Zeitung inauthentic news site linked to Haixun\npromotes story on Zenz citing Jonas Drosten persona (bottom)\n\n### Content Critical of the U.S. and its Allies\n\nAssets in this campaign promoted various narratives critical of the U.S. and its allies in\ndifferent languages, including:\n\nOn Aug. 1, several sites published articles critical of U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\nin response to reports that she may visit Taiwan in early August. The articles assert that\nPelosi should \"stay away from Taiwan\" and highlight perceived tarnished relations\nbetween the U.S. and Taiwan.\n\n\n-----\n\nOn June 30, six days after the U.S. Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade,\nwe observed an English-language article purportedly by an author claiming to be an\nAmerican woman living outside the U.S., which claimed that protesters against the\ndecision had been met with violence by U.S. law enforcement and U.S. civilians that\nsupported the decision to overturn Roe v. Wade (Figure 8).\nA Ukrainian-language article claimed that experiments run in alleged U.S. biolabs in\nUkraine have resulted in numerous Ukrainian deaths.\nAn article published on several sites, including one purporting to be a Taiwanese news\noutlet, claimed that former U.S. government official Mike Pompeo’s March 2022 visit to\nTaiwan was motivated by money and his alleged desire to run for U.S. president in\n2024. Additionally, it portrayed the U.S. as an unreliable ally, arguing that Taiwan\nshould not expect the U.S. to send troops to defend it from a potential invasion by\nChina.\n\nFigure 8: Inauthentic website posts article critical of decision of U.S. Supreme Court to\noverturn Roe v. Wade\n\n### Attacks on Critics of PRC Government and Support for Hong Kong Reform\n\nThe campaign promoted content attacking opponents of the PRC Government and content in\nsupport of Hong Kong’s reformed electoral system in 2021 that gave the PRC more power\nover vetting candidates.\n\n\n-----\n\nSome of the sites promoted content critical of Chinese virologist Dr. Yan Limeng and\nclaimed that she is the cause of the Asian hate crimes in the U.S., as well as content\ncondemning Chinese businessman Guo Wengui.\nOther sites promoted content critical of Falun Gong founder Li Hongzhi, including\nclaims that Falun Gong is a cult that has brainwashed and killed many people. They\nalso asserted that Li Hongzhi is a fraud and liar.\nOther articles praised the new electoral system in Hong Kong, claiming that it is widely\nsupported by the public, including on Chinese- and Arabic-language news sites (Figure\n9).\n\nFigure 9: Arabic-language news site promotes content supporting Hong Kong reform\n**Overlaps and Differences Between HaiEnergy and DRAGONBRIDGE**\n\n[We currently track HaiEnergy and DRAGONBRIDGE as separate campaigns due to](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/pro-prc-influence-campaign-expands-dozens-social-media-platforms-websites-and-forums)\ndifferences in campaign TTPs. We note though, that both campaigns promote similar\nnarratives, such as those alleging the existence of U.S.-funded biolabs globally, content\npertaining to China's alleged treatment of Uyghurs, and negative messaging surrounding\nPRC opponents such as Guo Wengui. Both campaigns also engage in the spam-like\npromotion of apolitical content. It is possible that these overlaps could be a result of shared\ntasking or group overlap, but we do not have evidence to make an assessment.\n\nDRAGONBRIDGE has typically leveraged thousands of social media and forum\naccounts across various authentic platforms to post comments, videos, and photos.\n\n\n-----\n\nHaiEnergy primarily leverages a network of inauthentic websites to disseminate\ncontent, alongside a small set of seemingly inauthentic accounts that promote material\nand, in some cases, appear to author content on certain sites.\nWe have not observed overlapping social media accounts, forums, websites or\ninfrastructure. Specifically, known DRAGONBRIDGE assets have not promoted content\nfrom HaiEnergy's inauthentic news sites.\n\n## Outlook\n\nWe note that despite the capabilities and global reach advertised by Haixun, there is at least\nsome evidence to suggest HaiEnergy failed to generate substantial engagement. Most\nnotably, despite a significantly large number of followers, the political posts promoted by\ninauthentic accounts we attribute to this campaign failed to gain much traction outside of the\ncampaign itself. This lack of amplification from external sources, not unlike what we typically\nobserved with DRAGONBRIDGE, limited the campaigns’ ability to breakout, essentially\nforming an echo chamber.\n\nArguably more interesting than assessing the campaign’s possible impact is its use of\ninfrastructure linked to Haixun, an observation which is suggestive of recent trends\nsurrounding the continued outsourcing of IO to third parties—\"IO for hire.” Notably, in mid[2021, Meta testified about an increase in the use of such firms, which have been used to](https://www.zdnet.com/article/disinformation-for-hire-pr-firms-are-the-new-battleground-for-facebook/)\nlower the barrier to entry for some threat actors and to obfuscate the identities of more\nsophisticated ones.\n\n## Appendix\n\n_Observed Languages_\n\nTable 1: Languages observed in HaiEnergy campaign\n\n\n**Languages**\n\n\nArabic\n\n\nChinese\n\n\nEnglish\n\n\nFrench\n\n\n-----\n\nHindi\n\n\nItalian\n\n\nKorean\n\n\nRussian\n\n\nThai\n\n\nUkrainian\n\n\nVietnamese\n\n\n_Websites Linked to Haixun_\n\nTable 2: Inauthentic websites linked to Haixun\n\n**Display Name** **Website URL**\n\n24 News 24usnews.com\n\nAisa Korea aisakorea.com\n\nAll City Times allcitytimes.com\n\nAnna Times annatimes.com\n\nAustria Weekly austriaweekly.com\n\nFocus on Russia automobile.trademarksdaily.com\n\n財富台灣 caifutw.com\n\nCharm Daily charmdaily.com\n\n\n-----\n\nCzech Weekly czechweekly.com\n\nDirector Times directortimes.com\n\nDonga Daily dongadaily.com\n\nEgypt Daily egyptdaily.org\n\nElec Daily elecdaily.com\n\nEspana Daily espanadaily.com\n\nEur Times eutimes.fr\n\nExactly News exactlynews.com\n\nE.MP finance.austriaweekly.com\n\nFinance.TZ finance.thaibizdaily.com\n\nFT Voice finance.thewarsawvoice.com\n\nTH Truth finance.thtruth.com\n\nFinland Weekly finlandweekly.com\n\nHani Daily hanidaily.com\n\nHanna Press hannapress.com\n\nHealth Latest Job News health.latestjobnews.in\n\n香港日報 hkdaily.net\n\nToyo Times hotels.toyotimes.com\n\n\n-----\n\n台灣焦點 hotintaiwan.com\n\nHurriyet Business hurriyetbusiness.com\n\nInspect News inspectnews.com\n\nJakarta Globe jakartaglobe.org\n\nKR Economy kreconomy.com\n\nKR Pop Star krpopstar.com\n\nLatest Job News latestjobnews.in\n\nLehua Times lehuatimes.com\n\nLori Times loritimes.com\n\nCharm Daily markets.charmdaily.com\n\nElec Daily markets.elecdaily.com\n\nHani Dal markets.hanidaily.com\n\nJoins Da markets.joinsdaily.com\n\nKR Economy markets.kreconomy.com\n\nMecha Times mechatimes.com\n\nMoscow TV moscowtv.vip\n\nNanyang Daily nanyangdaily.com\n\nNets Bay netsbay.com\n\n\n-----\n\nNew Delhi News newdelhinews.club\n\nNZL Daily newzealandgazette.com\n\nNGR Daily nigeriacom.com\n\nNew York City Morning Post nycmorning.com\n\nPortugal Daily portugaldaily.com\n\nQatar Daily qatardaily.org\n\nRAND Daily randdaily.com\n\nRU Business rubusiness.club\n\nRU Industrial ruindustrial.com\n\nRussian Daily russiadaily.org\n\nSain Times saintimes.com\n\nSaudi Weekly saudiweekly.com\n\nSeoul Daily seouldaily.org\n\nStartup India Magazine startupindiamagazine.com\n\nSwiss Weekly swissweekly.com\n\nSwiss Zeitung swisszeitung.com\n\nThe Korea Times thekoreatimes.org\n\nRussian Daily therussiadaily.com\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Thailands thethailands.com\n\nThe Warsaw Voice thewarsawvoice.com\n\nTH Truth thtruth.com\n\nToyo Times toyotimes.com\n\nTMK Daily trademarksdaily.com\n\nUnsee News unseenews.com\n\nHuabei Daily vn.huabeidaily.com\n\n香港週報 weeklyhongkong.com\n\nYarl Times yarltimes.com\n\nYasu Daily yasudaily.com\n\n\n-----",
