Thankfully, the Cisco Talos Group was able to find a method to break the\nencryption routine in order to create a decryptor that allows victims to recover their files for\nfree.\n\nWhile Thanatos never had a wide distribution, there were some victims of this\n[ransomware as indicated by submissions to ID Ransomware and from](https://id-ransomware.malwarehunterteam.com/) Cisco's\nanalysis. According to Cisco there were multiple campaigns, with version 1.1 being\ndistributed most widely.\n\nThis version used a more advanced ransom note and visibly showed the name and version of\nthe ransomware as displayed below. Victim's of this ransomware would also have their files\nencrypted and the names of the file's would have the .THANATOS extension appended to\nthem. For example, test.jpg would be encrypted and named as test.jpg.THANATOS.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Thanatos Ransom Note**\n\nCisco has also stated that other versions were released that did not contain any contact\ninformation and appeared to be designed to simply destroy the victim's data.\n\n\"In investigating the distribution mechanisms being used by the attacker to infect victims\nand remove their ability to access data on their system, we identified an interesting campaign\nthat indicated that at least in this particular case, the attacker had no intention of providing\nany sort of data decryption to the victim,\" Cisco's report stated. \"The malware appears to\nhave been delivered to the victim as an attachment to a chat message sent to the victim using\nthe Discord chat platform.\"\n\nAs Thanatos was released at one time as an open-source project, it is possible that other\ndevelopers were creating their own versions using same ransomware code base.\n\n## Decrypting files encrypted by the Thanatos Ransomware\n\n\n-----\n\nTo decrypt files encrypted by the Thanatos Ransomware, you should download the Thanatos\nDecryptor and save it to your desktop. You also need to make sure you have the Microsoft\nVisual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2017 installed or you will receive errors about\nmissing DLLs when you try to run the decryptor.\n\n**Thanatos Decryptor**\n\nOnce you have everything you need, simply double-click on the executable and the decryptor\nwill begin to search for files to decrypt. At this time, the decryptor will only decrypt the\nfollowing file types:\n\nImage: .gif, .tif, .tiff, .jpg, .jpeg, .png\nVideo: .mpg, .mpeg, .mp4, .avi\nAudio: .wav\nDocument: .doc, .docx, .xls, .xlsx, .ppt, .pptx, .pdf, .odt, .ods, .odp, .rtf\nOther: .zip, .7z, .vmdk, .psd, .lnk\n\nCisco also recommends that the decryptor be run on the same machine that the files were\nencrypted. The decryption process can take quite a while, so please be patient while it\ndecrypts your files.\n\nFor those who are interested in learning how decryptors work, Cisco has open sourced their\n[tool, which be found at the project's Github page.](https://github.com/Cisco-Talos/ThanatosDecryptor)\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n[Free decryptor released for Yanluowang ransomware victims](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/free-decryptor-released-for-yanluowang-ransomware-victims/)\n\n[New ‘Cheers’ Linux ransomware targets VMware ESXi servers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-cheers-linux-ransomware-targets-vmware-esxi-servers/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[SpiceJet airline passengers stranded after ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/spicejet-airline-passengers-stranded-after-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[US Senate: Govt’s ransomware fight hindered by limited reporting](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-senate-govt-s-ransomware-fight-hindered-by-limited-reporting/)\n\n[New RansomHouse group sets up extortion market, adds first victims](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-ransomhouse-group-sets-up-extortion-market-adds-first-victims/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
