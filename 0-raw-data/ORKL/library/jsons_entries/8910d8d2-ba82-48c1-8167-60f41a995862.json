    "plain_text": "# Russian cyberattacks pose greater risk to governments and other insights from our annual report\n\n**[blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2021/10/07/digital-defense-report-2021/](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2021/10/07/digital-defense-report-2021/)**\n\nOctober 7, 2021\n\nDuring the past year, 58% of all cyberattacks observed by Microsoft from nation-states have\ncome from Russia. And attacks from Russian nation-state actors are increasingly effective,\njumping from a 21% successful compromise rate last year to a 32% rate this year. Russian\nnation-state actors are increasingly targeting government agencies for intelligence gathering,\nwhich jumped from 3% of their targets a year ago to 53% – largely agencies involved in\nforeign policy, national security or defense. The top three countries targeted by\nRussian nation-state actors were the United States, Ukraine and the UK.\n\nThese are just a few of the insights in the second annual Microsoft Digital Defense Report,\n[which we released today and can be viewed for free here. The Microsoft Digital Defense](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/microsoft-digital-defense-report?rtc=1)\nReport covers the period from July 2020 to June 2021, and its findings cover trends across\nnation-state activity, cybercrime, supply chain security, hybrid work and disinformation.\n\n**Nation-State Activity**\n\n\n-----\n\nRussia is not the only nation-state actor evolving its approaches, and espionage is not the\nonly purpose for nation-state attacks this year.\n\nAfter Russia, the largest volume of attacks we observed came from North\nKorea, Iran and China; South Korea, Turkey (a new entrant to our reporting) and\nVietnam were also active but represent much less volume.\n\nWhile espionage is the most common goal for nation-state attacks, some\nattacker activities reveal other goals, including:\n\nIran, which quadrupled its targeting of Israel in the past year and launched\ndestructive attacks among heightened tensions between the two countries\n\nNorth Korea, which targeted cryptocurrency companies for profit as its\neconomy was decimated by sanctions and Covid-19\n\n21% of attacks we observed across nation-state actors targeted consumers and 79%\ntargeted enterprises with the most targeted sectors being government (48%), NGOs\nand think tanks (31%), education (3%), intergovernmental organizations (3%), IT (2%),\nenergy (1%) and media (1%).\n\nWhile China is not unique in its goal of information collection, it has been notable that several\nChinese actors have used a range of previously unidentified vulnerabilities.\n[HAFNIUM attacks targeting on-premises Exchange Servers have been well publicized,](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2021/03/02/new-nation-state-cyberattacks/)\nbut, in addition to the zero-day vulnerability used in those attacks, Microsoft detected and\nreported a [Pulse Secure VPN zero day and a](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2021/04/suspected-apt-actors-leverage-bypass-techniques-pulse-secure-zero-day.html) [SolarWinds zero day earlier this year, both](https://www.solarwinds.com/trust-center/security-advisories/cve-2021-35211)\nbeing exploited by Chinese actors.\n\n\n-----\n\nChina is also using its intelligence gathering for a variety of purposes. One Chinese actor,\nCHROMIUM, has been targeting entities in India, Malaysia, Mongolia, Pakistan and Thailand\nto glean social, economic and political intelligence about its neighboring countries. Another\nChinese actor, NICKEL, has targeted government foreign ministries in Central and South\nAmerica and Europe. As China’s influence shifts with the country’s Belt and Road Initiative,\nwe expect these actors will continue to use cyber intelligence gathering for insight into\ninvestments, negotiations and influence. Finally, Chinese actors are remarkably persistent;\n[even after we disclosed China’s attempts to conduct intelligence collection against](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/09/10/cyberattacks-us-elections-trump-biden/)\nindividuals involved in the 2020 election, its actor ZIRCONIUM continued its activity during\nElection Day.\n\nIn total, we’ve notified customers 20,500 times about attempts by all nation-state actors to\nbreach their systems in the past three years. To be clear, Microsoft does not observe every\nglobal cyberattack. For example, we have limited visibility into attacks targeting on-premises\n[systems that organizations manage themselves, like the Exchange Server attacks earlier this](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2021/03/02/new-nation-state-cyberattacks/)\nyear, and attacks targeting customers of other technology providers. We believe sharing the\ndata we do have on these threats is helpful to customers, policymakers and the broader\nsecurity community, and we invite others to share what they’re seeing with their visibility. The\ngood news is that our visibility into threats and our ability to help stop them will continue to\ngrow as more organizations move to the cloud.\n\n**Cybercrime**\n\n\n-----\n\nCybercrime – especially ransomware – remains a serious and growing plague as evidenced\nin this year’s Microsoft Digital Defense Report. But while nation-state actors mostly target\nvictims with useful information, cybercriminals target victims with money. As a result, the\ntargets often have a different profile. Cybercrime attacks on critical infrastructure – such as\nthe ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline – often steal the headlines. However, the top five\nindustries targeted in the past year based on ransomware engagements by our Detection\nand Response Team (DART) are consumer retail (13%), financial services (12%),\nmanufacturing (12%), government (11%) and health care (9%). The United States is by far\nthe most targeted country, receiving more than triple the ransomware attacks of the next\nmost targeted nation. The U.S. is followed by China, Japan, Germany and the United Arab\nEmirates.\n\nIn the past year, the “cybercrime-as-a-service” economy transitioned from a nascent but\nrapidly growing industry to a mature criminal enterprise. Today, anyone, regardless of\ntechnical knowledge, can access a robust online marketplace to purchase the range of\nservices needed to execute attacks for any purpose. The marketplace has three\ncomponents. First, as demand has increased, criminals are increasingly focused on\nspecializing in differentiated off-the-shelf infection kits and increasing their use of automation,\n\n\n-----\n\ndriving down their costs and growing their scale. We ve seen kits that sell for as little as\n$66. Second, separate suppliers provide compromised credentials needed to access\npeople’s systems and deploy the kits. We’ve observed credentials selling from $1 to\n$50 each, depending on the perceived value of the target. Third, cryptocurrency escrow\nservices serve as brokers between buyers and sellers to ensure the kits and\ncredentials perform as offered. We’ve also begun to identify sophisticated kits that not only\nprovide victim data to the criminal who purchased and deployed the kit but also secretly\nprovide the data to the entity that created the kit.\n\nRansomware continues to be one of the largest cybercrime threats and, in the past year, it\nhas continued to evolve to become more disruptive. Rather than focus on automated attacks\nthat rely on volume and easily paid low demands to generate profit, human-operated\nransomware uses intelligence gleaned from online sources, stealing and studying a victim’s\nfinancial and insurance documents and investigating compromised networks to select targets\nand set much higher ransom demands.\n\n**Fighting back in a hybrid work environment**\n\nAs online threats increase in volume, sophistication and impact we must all take steps to\nstrengthen the first line of defense. Deploying fundamental cybersecurity hygiene – like\nbrushing your teeth to protect against cavities or buckling your seatbelt to protect your life –\nare basic steps we all must take.\n\nFewer than 20% of our customers are using strong authentication features like multifactor\nauthentication, or MFA. We offer this for free, and organizations can turn it on by default for\ntheir users. In fact, if organizations just applied MFA, used anti-malware and kept their\nsystems updated, they would be protected from over 99% of the attacks we see today.\n\nOf course, technology companies like Microsoft have an important role to play in developing\nsecure software, developing advanced cybersecurity products and services for those\ncustomers that want to deploy them, and detecting and stopping threats. But organizations\ntaking basic steps to protect themselves will go further than the most sophisticated steps\ntech companies and governments might take to protect them. The good news is that, in the\npast 18 months, we’ve seen a 220% increase in strong authentication usage as companies\nhave thought about increasing their security posture in a remote work environment. The bad\nnews is that we still have a long way to go. Part of the solution needs to be skilling up more\ncybersecurity professionals who can help organizations of all kinds stay secure, and we’ll\nhave more to share on our work in this area in the coming weeks.\n\nThere are three trends that also give us hope.\n\nFirst, the U.S. government has taken unprecedented steps to address cybersecurity using\n[laws and authority already on the books. The Executive Order announced in May has gone a](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/)\nlong way to make the U.S. federal government and those it works with more secure, and the\n\n\n-----\n\nWhite House s leadership in partnering with the private sector in the midst of the Exchange\nServer attacks by HAFNIUM earlier this year set a new standard for incident-related\ncollaboration.\n\nSecond, governments around the world are introducing and passing new laws requiring things\nlike mandatory reporting when organizations discover cyberattacks so that appropriate\ngovernment agencies have a sense for scope of the problem and can investigate incidents\nusing their resources.\n\nThird, both governments and companies are voluntarily coming forward when they’re the\nvictims of attacks. This transparency helps everyone better understand the problem and\nenables increased engagement from government and first responders.\n\nThe trends are clear: nation-states are increasingly using, and will continue to use,\ncyberattacks for whatever their political objectives are, whether those\nare espionage, disruption or destruction. We anticipate more countries will join the list of\nthose engaging in offensive cyber operations, and that those operations will become more\nbrazen, persistent and damaging unless there are more serious consequences. And the\ncybercrime market will continue to become more sophisticated and more specialized unless\nwe all evolve our work to stop them. More work than ever is underway to counteract\nthese concerns, but we will need to ensure they remain on the top of national and\ninternational agendas in the coming years.\n\nTags: [cyber,](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/tag/cyber/) [cybersecurity,](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/tag/cybersecurity-2/) [Microsoft Digital Defense Report,](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/tag/microsoft-digital-defense-report/) [ransomware](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/tag/ransomware/)\n\n\n-----",
