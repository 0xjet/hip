These variations and their respective botnets were known as Wicked,\nOmni, and Owari (Sora), and had been previously used for DDoS attacks.\n\n## Botnet will also target Realtek routers\n\nBut the real problem here is not a malware author doing what he does best. The problem is\nthe relative ease with which Anarchy built a gigantic botnet within one day.\n\nHe didn't do it with a zero-day or some vulnerability that had not been exploited before. He\ndid so with a high-profile vulnerability that many botnets have exploited before.\n\nCVE-2017-17215 is a well-known exploit that has been abused by at least two versions of\n[the Satori botnet [1,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/amateur-hacker-behind-satori-botnet/) [2], and many of the smaller Mirai-based offshoots. You'd think that by](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/satori-botnet-has-sudden-awakening-with-over-280-000-active-bots/)\nnow users would have patched devices or ISPs would have blocked incoming connections\non port 37215.\n\n\n-----\n\nBut Anarchy is not done yet. The botnet author told Anubhav that he also plans to target\nCVE-2014-8361, a vulnerability in Realtek routers exploitable via port 52869.\n\n\"Testing has already started for the Realtek exploit during the night,\" Anubhav told Bleeping\n_Computer in a private conversation today. [Update: Both Rapid7 and Greynoise are_\n_[confirming that scans for Realtek have gone through the roof today.]](https://twitter.com/Andrew___Morris/status/1019971707703087104)_\n\nIt's both hilarious and sad that somebody can nowadays build a huge DDoS botnet in less\nthan a day. This only shows the real sad state of SOHO router security.\n\n**IOCs, courtesy of NewSky Security and CERT Tunisia:**\n\n**SHA-256: 61440574aafaf3c4043e763dd4ce4c628c6c92fb7d7a2603076b3f60f2813f1b**\n\n[[Source]](https://twitter.com/ankit_anubhav/status/1019649788361543680)\n\n**[C2: hxxp://104.244.72.82 [Source]](https://twitter.com/smii_mondher/status/1019949383230554112)**\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Honeypot experiment reveals what hackers want from IoT devices](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/honeypot-experiment-reveals-what-hackers-want-from-iot-devices/)\n\n[New EnemyBot DDoS botnet recruits routers and IoTs into its army](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-enemybot-ddos-botnet-recruits-routers-and-iots-into-its-army/)\n\n[Mirai malware now delivered using Spring4Shell exploits](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/mirai-malware-now-delivered-using-spring4shell-exploits/)\n\n[Beastmode botnet boosts DDoS power with new router exploits](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/beastmode-botnet-boosts-ddos-power-with-new-router-exploits/)\n\n[Cisco urges admins to patch IOS XR zero-day exploited in attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cisco-urges-admins-to-patch-ios-xr-zero-day-exploited-in-attacks/)\n\n[Catalin Cimpanu](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/catalin-cimpanu/)\n\nCatalin Cimpanu is the Security News Editor for Bleeping Computer, where he covers topics\nsuch as malware, breaches, vulnerabilities, exploits, hacking news, the Dark Web, and a few\nmore.
