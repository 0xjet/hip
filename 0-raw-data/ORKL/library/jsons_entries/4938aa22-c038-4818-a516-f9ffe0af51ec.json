    "plain_text": "# Breaking: Elite Cybercrime Forum \"Maza\" Suffers Breach\n\n**[flashpoint-intel.com/blog/breelite-cybercrime-forum-maza-breached-by-unknown-attacker/](https://www.flashpoint-intel.com/blog/breelite-cybercrime-forum-maza-breached-by-unknown-attacker/)**\n\nMarch 4, 2021\n\n[Blogs](https://www.flashpoint-intel.com/blog)\n\nBlog\n\n## Breaking: Elite Cybercrime Forum “Maza” Breached by Unknown Attacker\n\nOn March 3, 2021, Flashpoint detected a breach of the elite Russian cybercrime forum\nknown as “Maza” (originally called “Mazafaka”). This breach follows recent attacks (both\nattempted and successful) on other Russian cybercrime forums, including the takeover of\nRussian-language forum Verified.\n\n## “Maza” the Latest Russian Cybercrime Forum to Suffer a Breach\n\nOn March 3, 2021, Flashpoint detected a breach of the elite Russian cybercrime forum\nknown as “Maza” (originally called “Mazafaka”). This breach follows recent attacks (both\nattempted and successful) on other Russian cybercrime forums, including the takeover of\nRussian-language forum Verified.\n\nKnown to be in operations as far back as 2003, Maza is a highly-restricted Russian-language\ncybercrime that built its notoriety over many years, cultivating a community of some of the\n\n\n-----\n\nmost sophisticated cybercriminals and financial fraudsters in the criminal underground—\nmany of whom began their respective cybercrime activities as early as the mid- to late1990s. Little is known at this time about the attackers who successfully compromised Maza.\nAfter their successful takeover of Maza, the unknown attackers posted a warning message to\nforum members reading: “Your data has been leaked” and “This forum has been hacked.”\n\n## Initial Assessment Suggests Breach is Major in Scale\n\nFlashpoint analysts note that the Russian sentences on the warning page were likely\ntranslated using an online translator. It is unclear if this automated translation indicates a\nnon-Russian speaking actor is responsible or if this service was used as a misdirection\ntechnique.\n\n## Details Remain Obfuscated, but Scope of Attack Clearly Large\n\nFlashpoint analysts successfully obtained the purported leaked data. While the compromised\ndata appears to be extensive, it’s worth noting that the passwords have been hashed and\nmost other data fields included in the dump have been hashed or further obfuscated. The\nleaked Maza data includes the following:\n\n_User id_\n_Username_\n_email_\n_Password (hashed and obfuscated)_\n_Crt_filename_\n_Crt_pass_\n_Icq (when available)_\n_Aim (when available)_\n_Yahoo (when available)_\n_Msn (when available)_\n_Skype (when available)_\n\n### Figure 1: Screenshot of the Maza Breach Warning Posted by the Unknown Attackers\n\n\n-----\n\n## Distressed Cybercriminals Deliberate Options and Exit Strategies\n\nFlashpoint is actively monitoring cybercriminal discussions of Maza across the entire\ncybercriminal forum ecosystem commenting on the recent disruptions to many elite services\nand communities. Users on the Exploit forum are discussing moving away from using emails\nto register on forums as recent disruption efforts may have increased exposure of their online\nactivities. Others are claiming that the database leaked by the attackers is either old or\nincomplete.\n\n### Recent Uptick in Attacks on Russian Cybercrime Forums of Particular Concern to Cybercriminals\n\nExploit actors also note an increase in attacks over the past months (attempted DDoS of\nExploit, Verified compromise, and now Maza), and think the attackers could potentially be\nforum insiders or law enforcement. Finally, Exploit users note that if the attackers were law\n\n\n-----\n\nenforcement, that this is a new tactic to shut down cybercriminal activity and degrade trust\nacross forums. A user on Exploit warned other users to be careful with registered emails\nacross multiple platforms.\n\n## Maza Attackers May Take Similar Approach to Verified Ownership Change\n\nNews of the Maza attack comes directly on the heels of another successful breach of the\nwell-established Russian forum Verified on January 20, 2021. Less than a month later on\nFebruary 18, 2021, the new Verified admins announced the permanent change in ownership\nand began the deanonymization process of Verified’s previous operators, known as “INC,”\n“VR_Support,” and “TechAdmin”. The new admins noted that the previous administration\nrecorded the IP addresses of every Verified user upon their entrance, which resulted in the\ncollection of a total of 3,801,697 IP addresses.\n\nWhether or not the Maza attackers will pursue a similar ownership takeover remains unclear.\nQuite interestingly, however, the aforementioned INC admin is (or was) also a Maza\nmoderator.\n\n### Forum Breaches Are Not Strong Indicators of Permanent Shutdowns\n\nMaza was previously hacked on February 18, 2011, compromising the data of more than\n2,000 cybercriminal users, along with all of their forum correspondence. Shortly following this\n2011 Maza breach, another attack was carried out against the Russian cybercrime forum,\nDirectConnection, whose administrator was the famous “k0pa,” Aleksei Burkov.\n\n## See Flashpoint Intelligence in Action\n\n[Sign up for your risk-free 90-day trial and see how Flashpoint can provide you with the](https://www.flashpoint-intel.com/free-trial)\nactionable threat intelligence you and your entire team need to identify and respond to\nthreats targeting your organization.
