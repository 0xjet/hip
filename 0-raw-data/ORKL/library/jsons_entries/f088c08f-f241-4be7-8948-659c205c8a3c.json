The\nhospitality company, which managed luxury hotels and resorts, was headquartered in\nChicago and the servers for its website were located in northern Illinois.\n\nThe indictment charges Ozek, 32, with one count of intentionally causing damage to a\nprotected computer. Ozek is believed to be residing in Turkey, and a warrant for his arrest\nwill be issued.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe indictment was announced by John R. Lausch, Jr., United States Attorney for the\nNorthern District of Illinois; and Emmerson Buie, Jr., Special Agent-in-Charge of the Chicago\nField Office of the FBI. The government is represented by Assistant U.S. Attorney Vikas\nDidwania.\n\nThe public is reminded that an indictment is not evidence of guilt. The defendant is\npresumed innocent and entitled to a fair trial at which the government has the burden of\nproving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nThe charge in the indictment is punishable by up to ten years in federal prison. If convicted,\nthe Court must impose a reasonable sentence under federal statutes and the advisory U.S.\nSentencing Guidelines.\n\nAttachment(s):\n\n[Download Ozek indictment](https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndil/press-release/file/1437396/download)\nTopic(s):\n\nCybercrime\n\n\n-----",
