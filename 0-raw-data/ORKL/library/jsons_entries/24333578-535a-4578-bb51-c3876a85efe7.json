(Photo by Pierre Crom/Getty Images)\nWritten by [Sean Lyngaas](https://www.cyberscoop.com/author/sean-lyngaas/)\n\nJun 1, 2021 | CYBERSCOOP\nAn ex-U.S. ambassador to Russia, anti-corruption activists in Ukraine and election observers\nin other parts of Eastern Europe were among the apparent targets of a suspected Russian\nstate-sponsored hacking effort, according to data linked to the spying operation that a\nresearcher shared with CyberScoop.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe list offers classic examples of organizations that Russian spies might want to infiltrate,\nincluding those working to expose graft, combat disinformation and promote secure\nelections. It also points to the persistent threats that small nonprofits face from wellresourced hackers, as well as the long-running alleged Russian efforts to undermine\ndemocratic institutions.\n\n[Microsoft on May 27 said hackers had used a breached account belonging to the U.S.](https://www.cyberscoop.com/microsoft-solarwinds-russia-svr-usaid/)\nAgency for International Development, a U.S. government agency, to send phishing emails\nto some 3,000 email accounts at 150 organizations in 24 countries (U.S. officials estimated\nan even broader set of targets: 7,000 accounts and 350 organizations.)\n\n[Microsoft blamed the same Russian hacking group that exploited SolarWinds software to](https://www.cyberscoop.com/tag/solarwinds/)\nbreach U.S. government agencies — a group the White House has tied to Russia’s SVR\nforeign intelligence agency.\n\nThe U.S. government says it is still investigating the campaign impersonating USAID and\nhas yet to attribute the activity to a known group. Neither Microsoft nor U.S. officials named\nthe targets of the campaign.\n\nMultiple employees at the Anti-Corruption Action Centre (AntAC), a non-governmental\norganization that campaigns against corruption in Ukraine’s government, received phishing\nemails, but none clicked on the malicious code, according to co-founder Vitaliy Shabunin.\n\nAntAC is among “those who are pushing Ukraine out of the Russian sphere of influence,”\nShabunin said by phone from Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital. “We are pushing these [democratic]\nreforms to be part of the Western world.”\n\n“It’s understandable for me why Russians would want to spy on us,” he said.\n\nIt is also just one organization targeted in a would-be digital dragnet.\n\n[By plugging files used in the hacking campaign to VirusTotal, a platform for analyzing](https://www.cyberscoop.com/tag/virustotal/)\nmalicious code, Joe Slowik, a senior manager at security firm Gigamon, found email\naddresses associated with the service that the attackers used to track the phishing emails.\nThree other intelligence analysts corroborated Slowik’s findings.\n\nAmong the apparent intended recipients of the phishing campaign was Alexander “Sandy”\nVershbow, who was the deputy secretary general of North Atlantic Treaty Organization from\n[2012 to 2016 and the U.S. ambassador to Russia from 2001 to 2005. Russia sees NATO as](https://www.cyberscoop.com/tag/nato/)\n[a threat to its interests in Europe, and has allegedly used influence operations and hacking](https://www.cyberscoop.com/poland-cyberattack-russia-us-military/)\nto try to undermine the bloc.\n\nVershbow, now a fellow at the Atlantic Council think tank, did not respond to a request for\ncomment. The Atlantic Council declined to comment.\n\n\n-----\n\nAnother apparent target of the hackers was an employee of the Organization for Security\nand Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), an inter-government organization that works on arms\ncontrol and police reform in former Soviet and Eastern Bloc countries. An OSCE\nspokesperson said the organization was aware of the phishing attempts and was closely\nmonitoring the situation.\n\n“Like many international organizations, the OSCE is a frequent target of cyber threats. It\ntakes such incidents very seriously,” the statement continued. “The OSCE takes all possible\nmeasures to respond to and mitigate such attacks to protect all parts of the Organization.”\n\n[EU DisinfoLab, a Brussels-based nonprofit that pushed back on alleged Russian](https://www.disinfo.eu/publications/david-sputnik-vs-goliath-pfizer/)\ndisinformation activity around the coronavirus vaccine, was also an intended recipient of the\nphishing emails, according to the Virus Total data. Alexandre Alaphilippe, EU DisinfoLab’s\nexecutive director, declined to comment.\n\n[The Department of Homeland Security’s cyber division said May 29 that it had yet to see](https://twitter.com/CISAgov/status/1398648439001563136?s=20)\n“significant impact on federal government agencies” from the phishing campaign, while\nMicrosoft [said May 28 there wasn’t evidence of “any significant number of compromised](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2021/05/27/nobelium-cyberattack-nativezone-solarwinds/)\norganizations at this time.” The Justice Department on May 28 seized two internet domains\nthat, the department said, the hackers were using to distribute and control their malicious\ncode.\n\nThe seizure “was aimed at disrupting the malicious actors’ follow-on exploitation of victims,\n[as well as identifying compromised victims,” the Justice Department said in a press release.](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-court-authorized-seizure-domain-names-used-furtherance-spear)\n“However, the actors may have deployed additional backdoor accesses between the time of\nthe initial compromises and last week’s seizures.”\n\nRussian government officials routinely deny involvement in hacking operations, including the\ncampaign that exploited software made by U.S. federal contractor SolarWinds.\n\nFor Shabunin, though, it is familiar territory.\n\n“We are pretty aware of such kinds of threats, and we have training all the time and the\n[protocols to deal with them,” said Shabunin, whose house was burned down last year in](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-ukraine-activist-arson/ukrainian-anti-graft-group-says-razing-of-activists-house-was-assassination-bid-idUKKCN24O2S0)\napparent retaliation for his anti-corruption work.\n\nShabunin wants other NGOs to be vigilant. He said the phishing lure sent by the hackers,\nwhich referenced conspiracy theories pushed by former President Donald Trump, would be\nbizarre coming from USAID. The agency funds some of AntAC’s work, but doesn’t dabble in\npartisan politics.\n\nSome U.S. lawmakers reacted with anger to the latest alleged Russian hacking, with the\n[House Intelligence Committee chairman floating the idea of tightening sanctions. But the](https://intelligence.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=1133)\napparent target list reflects the type of Russian spying that has been going on for decades\n\n\n-----\n\nrather than any sort of escalation in cyberspace with the Biden administration. It also shows\nthat U.S. officials have to be wary of Russian espionage long after they’ve left public service.\n\nAs for Shabunin, his organization is busy preparing to host a conference next week on\ndisinformation threats to democracy with the presidents of Ukraine and Moldova.\n\n“It’s part of [the] job,” Shabunin said of dealing with cyberthreats.\n\n\n-----",
