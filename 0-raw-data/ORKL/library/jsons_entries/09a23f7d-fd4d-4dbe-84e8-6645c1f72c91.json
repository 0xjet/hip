Several media\noutlets reported that technical issues – believed to be caused by a cyber attack – had\noccurred during the opening ceremony. In this paper we will present the malware that we\nhave identified – with moderate confidence – as having been used in the attack. First, we will\ndescribe the malware’s propagation techniques and its destructive capabilities. The second\npart of the paper will be about attribution and how, in this particular case, the attacker\nincluded several false flags in order to point to other well-known threat actors. We will\nconclude by opening a discussion about how hard attribution can be, and presenting our\nview concerning the future of this discipline.\n\n## Introduction\n\n\n-----\n\nIn February 2018, the Olympic Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea were disrupted by a\ncyber attack. Reportedly, the attack resulted in the official Olympic Games website being\ntaken offline, meaning that spectators could not print their tickets. Media reporting at the\nopening ceremony of the Games was also impaired due to the Wi-Fi failing within the\nOlympic Media Centre. On 12 February, Talos published a blog post [1] detailing the\nfunctionality of the malware that we had identified with high confidence as having been used\nin the attack. We named the malware Olympic Destroyer.\n\nThis attack gained traction through the press, and several different media outlets published\nconflicting stories in relation to attribution.\n\nFigure 1: Different media outlets published conflicting stories in relation to attribution.\n\nIn the first part of this paper we will provide technical details of Olympic Destroyer, the wiper\ninvolved in the case, and in the second part we will discuss the attribution. Indeed, the\nmalware did not write itself, the incident did not happen by accident, but who was\nresponsible?\n\n## Part one: technical analysis\n\n### Initial sample\n\nThe initial sample\n(edb1ff2521fb4bf748111f92786d260d40407a2e8463dcd24bb09f908ee13eb9) is a binary\nthat, when executed, drops multiple files onto the victim host. These files are embedded as\nobfuscated resources within the binary. The embedded files have randomly generated file\nnames, however we found during our analysis that, when written to disk, the hashes of these\n\n\n-----\n\nfiles were the same on multiple instances. As a binary file, the initial sample could have been\ndelivered in a multitude of ways – the most likely is via a spear phished email with Olympic\nDestroyer as a malicious attachment.\n\nTwo of the dropped files (the stealing modules) are executed with two arguments: 123 and a\nnamed pipe. The named pipe is used as a communication channel between the initial stage\nand the dropped executable. The same technique was used in BadRabbit and Nyetya.\n\nThe initial stage is responsible for propagation. Network discovery is performed using two\ntechniques:\n\nChecking the ARP table with the Windows GetIPNetTable API\nUsing WMI (using WQL) with the request: SELECT ds_cn FROM ds_computer. This\nrequest attempts to list all the systems within the current environment/directory.\n\nThe network propagation is performed using PsExec and WMI (via the Win32_Process\nclass). Figure 2 shows the code executed remotely.\n\nFigure 2: Code executed remotely.\n\nThis code is responsible for leveraging cmd.exe to copy the initial stage to a remote system\nin %ProgramData%\\%COMPUTERNAME%.exe and executing it via a VBScript.\n\nLateral movement within an environment is achieved in a number of ways. Generally\nspeaking, there will either be one or more exploits used to allow remote code execution\nwithout credentials or we will see credentials/tokens being used within a piece of malware.\nThese credentials/tokens may either already be known or they may be harvested during\ninfection. With Olympic Destroyer we see the use of on-the-fly patching for credentials.\nOlympic Destroyer obtains these credentials from the infected systems, both previously\ncompromised and currently compromised, to hard code a set of credentials into the binary to\nallow lateral movement. The binary contains 32k bytes of space, located from offset 0x26F1A\nto offset 0x2EF1A, to allow for the patching of these credentials. Talos identified 44 unique\ncredentials within the samples analysed relating to Olympic Destroyer.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3: Talos identified 44 unique credentials within the samples analysed.\n\nThe burning question is: how did Olympic Destroyer obtain those credentials? The\nembedded resources mentioned earlier contain a couple of different credential-stealing\nmodules.\n\n### Credential harvesting\n\nTo obtain the credentials Olympic Destroyer uses a browser stealer and a system stealer.\nThis means that Olympic Destroyer attempts to harvest both from the browsers and from the\noperating system on the victim machine.\n\nOlympic Destroyer drops a browser credential stealer with the final payload embedded in an\nobfuscated resource. As mentioned previously, the sample must have two arguments to be\nexecuted. The stealer supports Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome. The malware parses\nthe registry and queries the sqlite file in order to retrieve stored credentials. SQLite is\nembedded in the sample.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4: SQLite is embedded in the sample.\n\nIn addition to the browser credential stealer, Olympic Destroyer drops and executes a system\nstealer. The system stealer attempts to obtain credentials from LSASS with a technique\nsimilar to that used by Mimikatz. Figure 5 shows the output format parsed by the initial stage.\n\nFigure 5: Output format parsed by the initial stage.\n\nUsing these two methods the malware is able to obtain additional credentials to support\nfurther lateral movement within the environment.\n\n### Destruction\n\nThe initial execution of the malware results in multiple files being written to disk, as\ndiscussed. Following this, the malware begins its destruction element. By leveraging\ncmd.exe from the host the malware first deletes all possible shadow copies on the system\nusing vssadmin:\n```\nC:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /c c:\\Windows\\system32\\vssadmin.exe delete shadows /all\n/quiet\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nNext, once again leveraging cmd.exe on the host, we see the author using wbadmin.exe. For\nthose not familiar with wbadmin, this is the replacement for ntbackup on modern operating\nsystems:\n```\nC:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /c wbadmin.exe delete catalog -quiet\n\n```\nThis step is carried out to ensure that file recovery is not trivial – WBAdmin can be used to\nrecover individual files, folders and even whole drives so this would be a very convenient tool\nfor a sysadmin to use to aid recovery.\n\nThe next step the attacker takes in this destructive path is once again to leverage cmd.exe,\nbut this time using bcdedit, a tool used for boot config data information, to ensure that the\nWindows recovery console does not attempt to repair anything on the host:\n```\nC:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /c bcdedit.exe /set {default} bootstatuspolicy\nignoreallfailures & bcdedit /set {default} recoveryenabled no\n\n```\nThe attacker has now attempted to make recovery extremely difficult for any impacted hosts.\nTo further cover the malware’s tracks and make analysis more difficult, the System &\nSecurity Windows event log is deleted:\n```\nC:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /c wevtutil.exe cl System\nC:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /c wevtutil.exe cl Security\n\n```\nWiping all available methods of recovery shows that this attacker had no intention of leaving\nthe infected machine useable. The purpose of this malware is to perform destruction of the\nhost, leave the computer system offline, and wipe remote data. We can see these functions\nwithin the Olympic Destroyer sample in Figure 6.\n\nFigure 6: The purpose of this malware is to perform destruction of the host, leave the\ncomputer system offline, and wipe remote data.\n\n\n-----\n\nTo finish its destructive phase Olympic Destroyer then disables all available Windows\nservices.\n\nThe malware uses the ChangeServiceConfigW API to change the start type to 4 which\nmeans: ‘Disabled: Specifies that the service should not be started’ (see Figure 7).\n\nFigure 7: The malware uses\n\nthe ChangeServiceConfigW API to change the start type to 4.\n\nAdditionally, the malware lists mapped file shares and for each share, it will wipe the writable\nfiles (using either uninitialized data or 0x00 depending on the file size). The purpose is to\ndestroy the files as quickly as possible. With this method, the malware can cause as much\ndisruption in as little time as possible.\n\n\n-----\n\nFinally, after modifying all the system configuration, the destroyer shuts down the\ncompromised system.\n\n### Legitimate file\n\nOlympic Destroyer also drops the legitimate, digitally signed, PsExec file in order to perform\nlateral movement. The use of this legitimate tool from Microsoft is an example of an attacker\nleveraging legitimate tools within their arsenal. Using legitimate tools like PsExec will save\nthe adversary time by eliminating the need to write their own tooling. A free alternative they\ncan wrap up within their malware is a much easier option in this instance.\n\n### Global workflow\n\nFigure 8 presents a summary of the global workflow of the malware, starting with the initial\nstage (Winlogon.exe) and the different modules.\n\nFigure 8: Summary of the global workflow.\n\n## Part two: attribution, or who wasn’t responsible\n\nAttributing attacks to specific malware writers or threat actor groups is neither simple nor an\nexact science. Many parameters must be considered, analysed and compared with previous\nattacks in order to identify similarities. As with any crime, cybercriminals have preferred\ntechniques, and tend to leave behind traces, akin to digital fingerprints, which can be found\nand linked to other crimes.\n\nIn terms of cybersecurity incidents, analysts would look for similarities or attributes such as:\n\nTactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) (how the attacker conducted the attack)\nVictimology (the profile of the victim)\n\n\n-----\n\nInfrastructure (the platforms used as part of the attack)\nIndicators of Compromise (IOCs) (identifiable artifacts left behind during an attack)\nMalware samples (the malware used as part of the attack)\n\nOne of the great things about software engineering is the ability to share code, to build\napplications on top of libraries written by others, and to learn from the successes and failures\nof other software engineers. The same is true for threat actors. Two different threat actors\nmay use code from the same source in their attacks, meaning that their attacks would\ndisplay similarities, despite being conducted by different groups. Sometimes threat actors\nchoose to include features from another group in order to frustrate analysts and try to lead\nthem to make a false attribution.\n\nIn the case of Olympic Destroyer, what is the evidence, and what conclusions can we draw\nregarding attribution?\n\nWithout contributions from traditional intelligence capacities, the available evidence linking\nthe Olympic Destroyer malware to a specific threat actor group is contradictory, and does not\nallow for unambiguous attribution. The threat actor responsible for the attack has\npurposefully included evidence to frustrate analysts and lead researchers to false attribution\nflags. Attribution, while headline grabbing, is difficult. This must force one to question\nattribution that is purely software based.\n\n### Olympic Destroyer lineup of suspects\n\n**The Lazarus group**\n\nThe Lazarus group, also referred to as Group 77, is a sophisticated threat actor that has\nbeen associated with a number of attacks. Notably, a spinoff of Lazarus, referred to as the\nBluenoroff group, has been identified as having conducted attacks against the SWIFT\ninfrastructure in a bank located in Bangladesh.\n\nThe filename convention used in the SWIFT malware, as described by BAE Systems [2],\nwas: evtdiag.exe, evtsys.exe and evtchk.bat.\n\nThe Olympic Destroyer malware checks for the existence of the following file:\n%programdata%\\evtchk.txt.\n\nThere is a clear similarity in the two cases. This is nowhere near proof, but it is a clue, albeit\na weak one.\n\nFurther clues are found in similarities between Olympic Destroyer and the wiper malware\nassociated with Bluenoroff, again described by BAE Systems [3]. In the example shown in\nFigure 9, the Bluenoroff wiper is on the left, and the Olympic Destroyer wiper on the right.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nFigure 9: Left: Bluenoroff wiper; right: Olympic Destroyer wiper.\n\nClearly, the code is not identical, but the very specific logic of wiping only the first 0x1000\nbytes of large files is identical and unique to the two cases. This is stronger evidence than\nthe file name check.\n\nHowever, both the file names used by Bluenoroff and the wiper function are documented and\navailable to anyone. The real culprits could have added the file name check and mimicked\nthe wiper function simply in order to implicate the Lazarus group and potentially distract from\ntheir true identity.\n\nOlympic Destroyer sample:\n23e5bb2369080a47df8284e666cac7cafc207f3472474a9149f88c1a4fd7a9b0\n\nBluenoroff sample #1:\nae086350239380f56470c19d6a200f7d251c7422c7bc5ce74730ee8bab8e6283\n\nBluenoroff sample #2:\n5b7c970fee7ebe08d50665f278d47d0e34c04acc19a91838de6a3fc63a8e5630\n\n_Kaspersky Lab identified [4] another link between Olympic Destroyer and samples used for_\nthe SWIFT attacks. This link is located in the header of the samples. More specifically in the\nRich header. Indeed, the Rich header of the Olympic Destroyer sample and Bluenoroff\nsample #1 are identical. The checksum (and XOR key) located after the ‘Rich’ magic value is\nexactly the same (see Figures 10 and 11)\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 10: Olympic Destroyer.\nae9a4e244a9b3c77d489dee8aeaf35a7c3ba31b210e76d81ef2e91790f052c85.\n\nFigure 11: Bluenoroff.\nae086350239380f56470c19d6a200f7d251c7422c7bc5ce74730ee8bab8e6283.\n\nIf we look at the information stored in this header, we can see that the compiler is Visual\nStudio 2003. This information is true concerning the Bluenoroff sample, however if we look\nclosely at the Olympic Destroyer sample, it’s wrong: based on Universal C Runtime (CRT)\nOlympic Destroyer was compiled with Visual Studio 2010. The author simply copied and\npasted the header from Bluenoroff to Olympic Destroyer. This action is strange and\nextremely specific – an actor has gone out of their way to perform this action. The tools using\ncode similarities generally ignore the Rich header and only work on the subsequent code.\n\n**APT3 & APT10**\n\n\n-----\n\n_Intezer Labs [5] identified code sharing between Olympic Destroyer and malware used in_\nattacks attributed to the APT3 and APT10 groups.\n\n_Intezer Labs discovered that Olympic Destroyer shares 18.5% of its code with a tool used by_\nAPT3 to steal credentials from memory. Potentially, this is a very strong clue. However, the\nAPT3 tool is, in turn, based on the open-source tool Mimikatz. Since Mimikatz is available for\ndownload by anyone, it is entirely possible that the author of Olympic Destroyer used code\nderived from Mimikatz, knowing that it had been used by other malware writers.\n\n_Intezer Labs also spotted similarities in the function used by Olympic Destroyer to generate_\nAES keys and that used by APT10. According to Intezer Labs, this particular function has\nonly ever been used by APT10. Maybe the malware writer has let slip a possible vital clue to\ntheir identity.\n\n**Nyetya**\n\nThe use of code derived from Mimikatz to steal credentials was also seen in the Nyetya [6]\n(NotPetya) malware of June 2017. Like Nyetya, Olympic Destroyer spread laterally by\nabusing the legitimate functions of PsExec and WMI. Like Nyetya, Olympic Destroyer uses a\nnamed pipe to send stolen credentials to the main module.\n\nUnlike Nyetya, Olympic Destroyer didn’t use the EternalBlue and EternalRomance exploits\nfor propagation. However, the perpetrator has left artifacts within the Olympic Destroyer\nsource code to insinuate the presence of SMB exploits.\n\nOlympic Destroyer includes the definition of these four structures, as shown in Figure 12,\nthat can also be found in the public EternalBlue proof of concept [7], as shown in Figure 13.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 12: Olympic Destroyer includes the definition of four structures that are also found in\nthe EternalBlue proof of concept.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 13:\n\nPublic EternalBlue proof of concept.\n\nThese structures are loaded during runtime, when Olympic Destroyer is executed, but\nremain unused. Clearly, the author knew of the EternalBlue PoC, but the reason why these\nstructures are present is unclear. It’s likely the author wanted to lay a trap for security\nanalysts to provoke a false attribution. Alternatively, we could be seeing the traces of\nfunctionality which never made it into the final malware.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAttribution is hard. Rarely do analysts reach the level of evidence that would lead to a\nconviction in a courtroom. Many were quick to jump to conclusions, and to attribute Olympic\nDestroyer to specific groups. However, the basis for such accusations are frequently weak.\n\n\n-----\n\nNow that we are seeing malware authors placing multiple false flags in their code, attribution\nbased on malware samples alone has become even more difficult.\n\nFor the threat actors considered, and with the evidence which we have available, there is no\nclear smoking gun indicating a guilty party. Other security analysts and investigative bodies\nmay have further evidence to which we do not have access. Organizations with additional\nevidence, such as signal intelligence or human intelligence sources, which may provide\nsignificant clues to attribution, may be the least likely to share their insights so as not to\nbetray the nature of their intelligence‑gathering operation.\n\nThe attack which we believe Olympic Destroyer to have been associated with was clearly an\naudacious one, almost certainly conducted by a threat actor with a certain level of\nsophistication who did not believe that they would easily be identified and held accountable.\n\nCode sharing between threat actors is to be expected. Open‑source tools are a useful\nsource of functionality, and adopting techniques from successful attacks conducted by other\ngroups is likely to be a source of misleading evidence leading to false attribution.\n\nEqually, we can expect sophisticated threat actors to take advantage of this, and to integrate\n‘evidence’ into their code that is designed to fool analysts, leading the analysts to attribute\nthe attacks to other groups. It is likely that, threat actors take pleasure in reading incorrect\ninformation published by security analysts. This could even be taken to the extreme of a\ncountry denying an attack based upon evidence presented by an unwitting third party due to\nfalse attribution. Every time there is misattribution it gives adversaries something to hide\nbehind. In this heightened era of fake news, attribution is a highly sensitive issue.\n\nAs their skills and techniques evolve, it is likely that we will see threat actors further adopting\nruses to complicate and confuse the process of attribution. Attribution is already difficult. It is\nunlikely to become easier.\n\n## References\n\n[1] Mercer, W.; Rascagneres, P. Olympic Destroyer Takes Aim At Winter Olympics.
