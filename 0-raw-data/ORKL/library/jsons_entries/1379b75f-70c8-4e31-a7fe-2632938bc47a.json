The hacker’s\ngoal was to install Remcos – a remote control tool – on the victims’ computers.\n\n## Attack Flow\n\nThe attackers initially sent fake emails that appeared to be from several legitimate\ncompanies across Germany. These emails contained invoices or urgent order attachments\nwhich were actually Remcos archives attempting to connect with the attacker’s command\nand control (C&C) server.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1: Example of a phishing email to the victims\n\nThe attachment is usually an archive containing an executable disguised as a PDF or other\ndocument file. The disguise is a simple comma PDF extension and folder icon.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2: An executable in disguise\n\nAfter the victim opens the file, Remcos executes silently and gives the attacker full control\nover the victim’s machine.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3: Attack flow chart\n\n## Communication with the C&C\n\nThe attacker then covers his tracks by using DDNS (Dynamic DNS), a legitimate service for\nmapping Internet domain names to dynamic IP addresses. Learn more about this well[known evasion technique at: https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1311/.](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1311/)\n\nBy using free DDNS accounts, the attacker has a large number of IP addresses at their\ndisposal and can use them to control the victims’ machines.\n\nFor example, the attacker uses [https://www.noip.com/ service to create the domain](https://www.noip.com/)\nablegod.hopto[.]org.\n\n## Remcos – a Swiss Army Knife RAT\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4: Picture from the official Remcos website\n\nDistributed and sold as a legitimate tool by a company called “Breaking Security” on a\npublic website, Remcos is an abbreviation for Remote Control and Surveillance and is sold\non a fremium model with a pro version priced from €58 – €389.\n\nBy using Remcos, the attacker can remotely gain full control of another machine and\ninclude the following functions:\n\nBypass AV products and privilege escalation:\n\nGain admin privileges\nDisable UAC (User Account Control)\nMaintain persistence on the targeted machine\nRun as a legitimate process (e.g. injection to Windows process)\nRun in the background, invisible to the victim\n\nCapabilities:\n\nKeylogger and clipboard\nScreenLogger\nAudio capture\nExtract passwords\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5: Campaign targeting Germany and other countries. 5/6 – 6/6\n\nCheck Point products successfully protect against this campaign.\n\nCheck Point Threat Emulation is a Zero-Day Protection solution that prevents infections\nfrom zero-day malware and targeted attacks using sandboxing capabilities.\n\nCheck Point SandBlast Agent provides purpose-built advanced Zero-Day Protection\ncapabilities to protect web browsers and endpoints, leveraging Check Point’s industry\nleading network protections.\n\n## Protections:\n\nCheck Point Threat Emulation:\n\nRAT.Win.Remcos.A\nRAT.Win.Remcos.C\nRAT.Win.Remcos.D\n\nCheck Point SandBlast Agent:\n\nRAT.Win.Remcos.B\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6: Threat emulation report blocking Remcos\n\nThe full Threat Emulation report can be found here –\n\n[https://forensics.checkpoint.com/remcos_te/ThreatEmulationReport.html](https://forensics.checkpoint.com/remcos_te/ThreatEmulationReport.html)\n\nThe full SBA report can be found here –\n\n[https://forensics.checkpoint.com/remcos/index.html](https://forensics.checkpoint.com/remcos/index.html)\n\n**_A special thanks to our colleague Arie Olshtein for his contribution on this research!_**\n\n**Indicators of Compromise:**\n\n\n-----\n\n303b30ca9d902de72ce83e2b53a496ab2275e4ab58f1151bed1484f421ecc0fa\n97732c98efbaba02b124439795b3b90985ee0aba906021d5c0a348c79f866230\nc0808c63274677a56177fda9f78ce04bb35e0190740acb2ed268b23a0943ef35\na4f06a387a1c920d6ebec1098f410879fdf8d9f983209f7e8102a1c6d4b459e9\n5a9922e81bce762658f36f7d1946a02d63c0430d0b29caf3ee5f70ab7dfd40f2\n7a5aaecbf18cc78f77f307391716af241313f37eeb5a5fb4080c66574aa6b470\n568172c320330ceb592add095493beee53446a0310dbf894d2f8f6a1cc4080f3\ndc607b53277b8a0b83dee0b2893d50df0edb5550f94b88381b614ddc163ebe66\ne3cc136991d5c302aeef3f75712ac93f4c4eaf88425494511aaafcfc5247fad5\n874d254f69efa9193d96c0dbec74b5995f84f9253ba8524e0cfe0f7f612bfb62\n3f8fa4dc5fcbef7c853a85e9abefbe78b2da3275b96a4288db871453a0a4b853\n48813f9c61687fb59ca606160b24b1b560d43152ee8fb09692475dd8ac5871f1\na02b84b2c2fad7ba6ccd785017e5f64fe9bd1251fc3fb3cc04175d5a904568b1\namblessed.ddns[.]net\nableyahweh.ddns[.]net\nuaeoffice999.warzonedns[.]com\npmv1515.duckdns[.]org\nforbbma.ddns[.]net\nalexthomas.ddns[.]net\ntimmy66.ddns[.]net\ntimmy55.ddns[.]net\nablegod.hopto[.]org\n\n\n-----",
