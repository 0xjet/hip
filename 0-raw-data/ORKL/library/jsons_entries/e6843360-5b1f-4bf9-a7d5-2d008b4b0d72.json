Maintaining good, operationally safe hygiene when setting up this infrastructure is difficult and requires\ndiligence on behalf of the threat actors - imposing a cost on them that they must bear in order to remain undetected\nfor as long as possible. Failure to do so provides detection opportunities to diligent hunters.\n\nDespite the long campaign dwell time discussed here [2] - with its setup dating to December 2020 – some 4 months\nbefore publishing this report, this article highlights 3 mistakes that we observed and exploited as defenders for\nhunting purposes:\n\nThe sequential IPs hosting shared infrastructure between at least veehy[.]com & zoom-download.huvpn[.]com\nand links to two other domains and an additional IP address.\n\n\n-----\n\nInfrastructure reuse in hosting the ZoomPortable campaign that led to the discovery of a related WindScribe\n(aka VPN) campaign via hosting it on the same domain as was used for the ZoomPortable campaign.\nCode Signing Certificate re-use between these two campaigns that further ties the two malware families\ntogether.\n\n## “ZoomPortable”\n\nIn late March 2021, Theta observed the earliest currently documented example of `zoom.exe`[3] (via ZoomPortable\n\n[4]) spawning malicious behaviour [5] - namely a certain b.ps1 [6] - in the wild. This PowerShell script was a curiously\nobfuscated [7] environmental reconnaissance package that sent system and environmental data back to a command\nand control server - plausibly to then be selected for delivery of follow-on capabilities in the form of a second stage\npayload from the threat actor based on their own criteria.\n\nWhilst this behaviour was detected and blocked as it happened, the trail of where this binary came from unfortunately\nwent cold. Our team could trace the installation of ZoomPortable.exe back some days earlier as coming from a\nbrowser download but the user’s device was unfortunately wiped before browser forensics could be conducted and\nnetwork traffic for the download was not captured. We also noted in our initial analysis that there were no public\nreferences to a zoom portable version, and some of the configuration of the software appeared odd [8].\n\nAt the time, we put this incident down to either a phishing campaign or a backdoored lookalike zoom package that\ntricked the victim into downloading and installing from somewhere other than the zoom directly - with the latter likely\nbased on conversations with the user and email analysis turning over no signs of a phish. Because ZoomPortable\ncontains legitimate (and working) Zoom components, legitimate Zoom.us network traffic was also observed,\nhampering technical analysis and further confusing the situation.\n\nTheta shared some of these findings to various trusted partners in the cyber security community at the time – and\nthankfully ZoomPortable.exe and its malicious nature were later also observed and corroborated by other members\nof the cyber security community in New Zealand in early April 2021 (approximately two weeks later) after their own\nversion b.ps1 was detected - complete with a new hard-coded C2 address.\n\nExcellent work has been done with further analysis [9] of this malware campaign – with more still to come. The\ndisruption of this wider campaign is something we are proud to have been able to contribute to.\n\nIt was this later, largely community-driven and collaborative investigation that subsequently uncovered two websites\nmasquerading as the legitimate zoom.us website. Some of this overlapping infrastructure and its components are the\nfocus of this article. Both veehy[.]com [10] & zoom-download.huvpn[.]com [11] were detected by partners who worked\nbackwards after they were alerted when their own copies of ZoomPortable.exe had spawned b.ps1. Both these\ndomains had links to ZoomPortable.exe binary hosted in Amazon Web Services.\n\n## Additional Infrastructure and Sequential IPs\n\nVeehy and huvpn both appeared to be identical in their configurations: clones of the legitimate Zoom.us website and\noccupied the sequential IPs 5.39.216[.]178 & 5.39.216[.]179 at the time of discovery.\n\nTraffic passively recorded communicating with these IPs also reference a cayzor[.]com who had pointed towards\n5.39.216[.]177 at the time of discovery; and cayzor’s LetsEncrypt TLS Certificate itself references an oulous[.]com in\nX509 alternate name metadata [12]. Oulous also resolves to 5.39.216[.]179 (thus providing the link from\n5.39.216[.]179 to cayzor at 5.39.216[.]177 and oulous back at 5.39.216[.]179 [13]).\n\nUnfortunately, we are not aware of any graphical scans or scrapes cayzor and oulous whilst under threat actor\ncontrol so it is unclear exactly how or if these domains were part of the same malware campaigns, but we assess\nwith high confidence they were under control of the same malicious actor responsible for these campaigns via the\nmethodology described above – so they should be hunted for regardless.\n\n## Infrastructure Reuse & Similarties\n\n\n-----\n\nPassive DNS records, certificate transparency logs and URLScan [14] all captured veehy[.]com at various points in\nits lifecycle. veehy[.]com was an old domain (created in 2008) [15] with the now removed subdomain\nvpn.veehy[.]com receiving updated TLS certificates on 22 December 2020 (along with the rest of veehy)[16].\nURLScan also automatically scanned the page at this time [17]:\n\nvpn.veehy[.]com - Image Credit: Urlscan.io\n\nThis page purports itself to be Windscribe [18] – a personal VPN product, and it had an outbound link to a similarly\nformatted [19] AWS hosted binary as the ZoomPortable Campaign. URLScan helpfully recorded [20] this as\n_https[:]//windscribe.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws[.]com/Windscribe.exe and we assess that this binary appears to be the_\nfirst stage of an earlier and overlapping but, as yet, undetected campaign by the same threat actors.\n\nThis URL was also captured [21] in VirusTotal – a popular clearing house and repository for threat researchers and\ncyber security Professionals on the 10 of December 2020. th\n\nVirusTotal recorded that the body (aka the file Windscribe.exe) of the subsequent transaction had SHA-256 hash of\n_1495500d6c8613fda22b0e0c8f2ab0ba5d244d6b166c5d854a47000a91f44ab1_\nThe file this hash was derived from was also ingested at this time and is available on VirusTotal [22] – where at the\ntime of this article it continues to have 0 detections.\n\n\n-----\n\nImage Credit: VirusTotal\n\n[View enlarged image](https://www.theta.co.nz/media/4126/cs2.png)\n\n## Signing Certificate Overlap\n\nWhilst the vpn.veehy[.]com page and the windscribe.exe download link was already removed from the internet prior\nto detection, we can see several components of the aforementioned `Windscribe.exe`[23] overlap with the original\n`zoom.exe`[24] that was detected right at the start of this report - both binaries are signed with the same DigiCert EV\nCodesigning Certificate: Issued to TRATTORIA WYKI SP Z O O:\n\nImage Credit: VirusTotal\n\nAdversaries obtaining codesigning certificates to aid in camouflaging their tooling is nothing new, but this overlap\nprovides several further detection opportunities for us:\n\nThis certificate (SN: 074A080F649B2D5B784675B302A963B7 // Thumbprint:\nB43C94F107B19D2B23DB41F45D5ADCBC5342CD46) points to several other suspicious files that are likely related\nto the Windscribe/VPN campaign – namely:\n\n\n-----\n\nWindscribePatchExe [25] SHA256: da88dc8fbc02a32d336fc8a20f67f01fc3fe833068d0275cb7f5610566d28824\n\nWindscribe TAP install helper [26] - SHA256:\nfb55cc18b16707eeb53dd51e0e4e1e7046fd7a9e1b2ec1f5a128cef8810bcbd9\n\nWindscribe.aiui [27] - SHA256: 77986a638410d6d312e5eef8dd142182b50623a3aae361ccf7e6d997ec1b7581\n\nAt the time of analysis these files again have no detections in VirusTotal – but should be considered likely malicious\ndue to the multiple points of overlapping infrastructure and TTPs with the known bad ZoomPortable campaign.\n\n**Note: Legitimate WindScribe appears to be signed with it’s own, different, signing certificate (SN:**\n0f5ee43beea50ed5f0ec765bf65b1350 // Thumbprint: 2d89451abf19019641927f6fa09be531d84981b6) – further reenforcing the suspiciousness of the TRATTORIA WYKI issued certificate in this context.\n\n## Summary\n\nOur analysis (as well as others) is currently ongoing, but points to the strong possibility of malicious backdoored VPN\nproducts being deployed from December 2020 that remain undetected to this time, as well as the previously\nundetected ZoomPortable campaign remaining in the wild. We do not yet have any indication of how widely installed\nor targeted either campaign was, or what the end goal of the threat actor was. So far information about these\ncampaigns is scant.\n\nThe presence of these classes of software for both campaigns (a backdoored Zoom and a backdoored VPN) on\nendpoints coupled with the follow-on activity that has been described in the ZoomPortable campaign should be\nconcerning to organisations of all sizes as well as home users. This is only exacerbated given the long time delta\nobserved (circa 7 days in one example) between installation of zoomportable.exe and a malicious payload executing,\nas well as the use of a valid signing certificate for the backdoored but otherwise working software components which makes for difficult detection and easy classification of a false positive alert.\n\nGenerally, a reasonably high level of instrumentation was required for detection of the ZoomPortable campaign. It\nrequired enough telemetry to catch the spawning of b.ps1 out of a signed and legitimate looking version of\nZoom.exe. Without any of the network infrastructure along the way being classified as malicious and no antivirus\nengines flagging the files as bad - organisations without EDR or similar tooling as well as the competent hunters or\nresponders able to make sense of the alerts generated would struggle to detect this behaviour. This plausibly\nexplains the long campaign runtime. It would also effectively rule out the prospect of home users (who may well be\ninterested in either a personal VPN or Zoom) or non-corporate managed devices being able to block or detect\nbackdoored copies of ZoomPortable or Windscribe (if backdoored in a similar manner).\n\nAlthough we do not have enough visibility into the victimology of these campaigns to suggest home users are\nimpacted, Windscribe in particular would not generally be described as enterprise software. Given this, we provide\nthe following guidance for detection.\n\n### Theta recommends hunting for these components at a minimum\n\nTraffic since December 2020 to the sequential IP addresses 5.39.216[.]177, 5.39.216[.]178 & 5.39.216[.]179\n(ASN: 57043 // HostKey – geolocated in the Netherlands).\nTraffic since December 2020 to veehy[.]com, huvpn[.]com, cayzor[.]com or oulous[.]com.\nAny of the indicators for the ZoomPortable campaign (as referenced at https://pastebin.com/FGHXxRdu).\nAny evidence of software in your environment code signed with the DigiCert EV Codesigning Certificate Issued\nto TRATTORIA WYKI SP Z O O (SN: 074A080F649B2D5B784675B302A963B7 // Thumbprint:\nB43C94F107B19D2B23DB41F45D5ADCBC5342CD46).\n\n\n-----\n\nThe specific components of Windscribe.exe  signed with this same certificate:\n\nexe - SHA256: 1495500d6c8613fda22b0e0c8f2ab0ba5d244d6b166c5d854a47000a91f44ab1\nWindscribePatchExe - SHA256:\nda88dc8fbc02a32d336fc8a20f67f01fc3fe833068d0275cb7f5610566d28824\nWindscribe TAP install helper - SHA256:\nfb55cc18b16707eeb53dd51e0e4e1e7046fd7a9e1b2ec1f5a128cef8810bcbd9\naiui - SHA256: 77986a638410d6d312e5eef8dd142182b50623a3aae361ccf7e6d997ec1b7581\n\nTheta Cyber Security would be grateful for any reports of hits for these IOCs for further co-ordination and tracking.\nVictimology, information regarding how victims were directed to the domains mentioned in this article and\nobservations around follow-on activity would be most appreciated.\n\n**References**\n\n[1] https://www.inde.nz/blog/different-kind-of-zoombomb\n\n[2] With a caveat that tight target selection on behalf of the threat actors may have significantly downsized detection\nopportunities – we do not have this visibility into target selection or victimology at the current time however.\n\n[3] First discovered as SHA256: df8659f990176e4845615486055305a5dc7024c732850bc3043c64e8393dc38b – at\nC:\\Users\\<user.name>\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\zoom\\Zoom.exe\n\n[4] First discovered as SHA256: fd03b531ad1d8d7358b7b50912841f81b6ea6e4e364ca6af8f0dc61aa7d3d152\n\n[5] Execution flow of %temp%\\`zoom.exe` -> cmd.exe -> powershell.exe -> b.ps1\n\n[6] First discovered and reported as SHA256:\nf547410bd2f0b667b640e350d7c8c55cd4c2f7249e534c02c63d824c87ee2454 – b.ps1 – nb: a hard coded C2 IP in\nthis script results in different SHA256 hashes.\n\n[7] Despite reasonably heavy obfuscation of the capabilities of the script, the IP address it pointed to was available\nconspicuously in unencoded form right at the start of the file – we assess this was to facilitate the actors rotating it\nwith new hard coded IPs if they suspected or suffered from detection of their early stage C2 infrastructure or perhaps\nproactively as part good operational security practices. At least 2 known b.ps1’s exist at the current time. This further\npoints to the operational cost and overhead for an actor in maintaining covert and operationally safe infrastructure –\nalthough we understand there is a multistage model of C2 infrastructure with the ZoomPortable Campaign and the\nloss of early stage C2 does not represent detection of the later C2 stages or the capabilities associated with it. We\nunderstand b.ps1 was downloaded from a first stage of C2 infrastructure prior to being executed on the host.\n\n[8] ie: running out of %temp% and unpacking from 7zip archives.\n\n[9] https://pastebin.com/FGHXxRdu\n\n[10] https://urlscan.io/result/6cc2b423-6d01-4151-93c3-b8ab36824b69/\n\n[11] https://urlscan.io/result/cc3bd261-7edb-4253-8284-009cfe04760a/\n\n[12] See: https://crt.sh/?id=4331658350\n\n[13] See: https://community.riskiq.com/search/5.39.216.179/resolutions\n\n[14] https://urlscan.io/ - a powerful utility for threat hunting and defenders in general.\n\n[15] All the malicious domains mentioned in this article appear to have been old and likely abandoned but benign\ndomains before being acquired by the threat actor and updated to host malicious infrastructure – which is a useful\ntechnique in avoiding the suspicion that comes with using newly registered domains.\n\n[16] https://crt.sh/?id=3815840137\n\n\n-----\n\n[17] https://urlscan.io/result/6250dcdf dde4 4ce9 841f 6e762550b201/\n\n[18] https://windscribe.com/\n\n[19] Compare with the two known ZoomPortable binaries hosted @\n\nhttps[:]//zoom-download[.]s3[.]us-east-2[.]amazonaws[.]com/ZoomPortable.exe\n\nhttps[:]//zoom-portable[.]s3[.]us-east-2[.]amazonaws[.]com/ZoomPortable.exe\n\n[20] see: https://urlscan.io/result/6250dcdf-dde4-4ce9-841f-6e762550b201/#links\n\n[21] See:\nhttps://www.virustotal.com/gui/url/b4b5a269db3cbaf333e754f7a58a0b723e6529fe61b5438b664795f4545f74c5/detection\n\n[22]\nhttps://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/1495500d6c8613fda22b0e0c8f2ab0ba5d244d6b166c5d854a47000a91f44ab1/details\n\n[23] SHA256: 1495500d6c8613fda22b0e0c8f2ab0ba5d244d6b166c5d854a47000a91f44ab1\n\n[24] Aka SHA256: df8659f990176e4845615486055305a5dc7024c732850bc3043c64e8393dc38b\n\n[25]\nhttps://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/da88dc8fbc02a32d336fc8a20f67f01fc3fe833068d0275cb7f5610566d28824/details\n\n[26]\nhttps://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/fb55cc18b16707eeb53dd51e0e4e1e7046fd7a9e1b2ec1f5a128cef8810bcbd9/details\n\n[27]\nhttps://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/77986a638410d6d312e5eef8dd142182b50623a3aae361ccf7e6d997ec1b7581/det\nails\n\n### 24/7 protection with Theta Managed Detection and Response\n\nConcerned about keeping up with cyber threats?
