Their cyber capabilities despite the banning of](https://csis-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/legacy_files/files/publication/151216_Cha_NorthKoreasCyberOperations_Web.pdf)\nany internet services all over the state, apart from their native intranet “Kwangmyong”, has\nbeen said to be rather longitudinal; it has gained notoriety for its past hacking activities, most\n\n\n-----\n\n[remarkably the attacks against Sony Pictures Entertainment in 2014 and the Bangladesh](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/10/the-untold-story-of-the-sony-hack)\nbank heist in 2016, cryptocurrency and bank heists, and ransomware attacks. Of course,\nthere is no way to cross-reference or verify whether its deliberate dissemination or accurate\ninformation. So, relying on any open-source information can result in an echo chamber effect\nof establishing them as evidential facts.\n\nNorth Korea’s existing political and military strategies can help provide context for\nunderstanding its cyber strategy. Traditionally, they have relied on a system of asymmetrical\nand irregular combination of warfare to sidestep the conventional military deadlock in the\npeninsula. Cyber capabilities would provide for a risk-minimized means of exploiting USA\nand ROK vulnerabilities at a low intensity. During peacetime, this can allow them to upset the\nstatus quo by using cost-effective strategies to target USA and ROK command control,\ncomputers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (C4ISR) in support of their “quick\nwar, quick end” strategy.\n\nSince the 1990s, the DPRK has come a long way in terms of cyber warfare, when the\ncomputer infrastructure was rudimentary at best. Kim Jong-il recognized the value of cyber\ncapabilities back then, which gave North Korea ample time to recruit and train human\nresources and invest in institutions to develop and sustain the country’s assets in\ncyberspace.DPRK’s priorities in the realm of information and communications technology\n(ICT) are embedded in the leadership’s national strategy, which is essentially composed of\ntwo main parts: national security and economic development. It is no different from any other\nstate, except that the type of regime, division of the two Koreas, and its external environment\npresents several threats and challenges that affect its cyber posture.\n\n\n-----\n\n_North_\n\n_Korea, whose government is the only one on earth known to conduct nakedly criminal_\n_hacking for monetary gain, has run schemes in some hundred and fifty nations. Illustration by_\nAnuj Shrestha.\nWhen in 2009, the US National Intelligence Estimate dismissed North Korea, noting it would\ntake years to develop them into a meaningful threat. Yet right around that time, that same\nyear, North Korea reportedly unified all of its intelligence and internal security services and\nbrought them under the direct control of the National Defense Commission to cement the\ncontrol of current North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. It merged intelligence organizations and\nits various cyber units such as Bureau 121 into the Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB).\nIt later became their primary foreign intelligence service, and headquarters for cyber\noperations. In 2013, the RGB reportedly also established Unit 180, tasked with hacking\ninternational financial institutions to extract foreign currency in support of North Korea’s\nnuclear and ballistic missile programs. It would also install malicious backdoors in software\n\n\n-----\n\ndevelopment businesses in Japan and China. Over the years, the focus of Unit 180 shifted\ntoward targeting cryptocurrency exchanges while Bureau 121 has expanded its cyber\noperations beyond South Korea by attacking foreign infrastructure elsewhere.\n\n_The RGB chain_\n[North Korea’s cyber operations reflect at least three distinct characteristics. First, North](https://www.eastasiaforum.org/2020/09/24/north-koreas-evolving-cyber-warfare-strategy/)\nKorea’s cyber units and hacker groups have shown considerable diversity in terms of their\ncapabilities and experience. The line between low-end and high-end North Korean\ncyberspace operations has frequently been blurred. North Korea can employ non-state\nactors as surrogates, utilise low-cost, off-the-shelf tools that are freely available and exploit\nknown techniques such as denial of service attacks.\n\nSecond, North Korea has gradually demonstrated a resolve for cyber-escalation, targeting\nthe critical infrastructure of other nation-states as well as private corporations and banks for\nvarying political motivations. Increasingly, it also aims to achieve illicit financial gain by\nbypassing international sanctions and generating foreign currency.\n\nThird, the essential ‘dialectics of North Korea’s cyberspace’ is asymmetric. Its internet\ninfrastructure is isolated from global networks, with the country’s entire internet traffic\n[channelled through only two providers — China’s Unicom and Russia’s TransTeleCom. The](https://www.smh.com.au/world/north-korea-opens-up-a-second-internet-connection-enabled-by-russia-20171003-gyt7hx.html)\ncountry is largely unplugged from the global internet and is ringfenced by China’s ‘Great\nFirewall’.\n\n\n-----\n\nSource: VTech Solution Inc.\nNorth Korean hacker groups have therefore been widely dispersed places elsewhere, such\nas China, Russia, Southeast Asia, and even Europe, acting independently or mutually\nsupporting each other based on their specific cyber missions.\n\nThus, it is safe to say that the cyber operations carried out by North Korea are not ad hoc,\n_[isolated incidents. They are the accumulation of carefully planned efforts under the direction](https://csis-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/legacy_files/files/publication/151216_Cha_NorthKoreasCyberOperations_Web.pdf)_\nof preexisting organizations that directly support the country’s national strategy. Knowing\nwhich organizations do this, is extremely crucial because they do not have a published cyber\ndoctrine. The Reconnaissance General Bureau and General Staff Department of the Korean\nPeople’s Army generally control most of North Korea’s known cyber capabilities ranging from\npeacetime provocations to wartime disruptive operations.\n\nThe Evolution of North Korean Cyber Threats. Source: The Asian Institute for Policy Studies\n\n\n-----\n\nNorth Korea [has spearheaded fraudulent cyber operations to circumvent sanctions, gaining](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/04/26/the-incredible-rise-of-north-koreas-hacking-army)\naccess to the international financial system and illegally forcing the transfer of funds from\nfinancial institutions, SWIFT banking networks, and cryptocurrency exchanges worldwide. At\nthe same time, North Korea also has been able to protect its critical infrastructure from\npotential reprisals, limiting its access, dependencies, and vulnerabilities on the internet and\ncommunication networks by relying instead primarily on China’s internet infrastructure. This\nhas been augmented only recently with a second internet link to Russian networks, and\ndispersion of its hackers to select countries worldwide, including India, Nepal, Kenya,\nMozambique, and Indonesia.\n\nConsequently, North Korea’s 21st-century cyber operations have essentially become\nweapons of mass effectiveness working alongside the weapons of mass destruction in its\nnuclear arsenal, together composing a unified asymmetric political strategy designed to\npressure the United States and the wider international community to recognize as legitimate\nSupreme Leader Kim Jong-Un’s interpretation of North Korea’s sovereignty and security.\n[Lately, Kim Jong Un has quietly built a 7,000-man cyber army that gives North Korea an](https://www.businessinsider.in/politics/world/news/kim-jong-un-has-quietly-built-a-7000-man-cyber-army-that-gives-north-korea-an-edge-nuclear-weapons-dont/articleshow/76427661.cms)\nedge nuclear weapons does not.\n\nAs Kim reportedly declared in 2013, “cyberwarfare, along with nuclear weapons and\nmissiles, is an ‘all-purpose sword’ that guarantees our military’s capability to strike\nrelentlessly.”\n\n## תגובות\n\nתגובות\n\n\n-----",
