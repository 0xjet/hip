We recently\ndiscovered that EMOTET has a new iteration (detected as TSPY_EMOTET.SMD10) with a\nfew changes in its usual behavior and new routines that allow it to elude sandbox and\nmalware analysis.\n\nBased on our findings, EMOTET’s dropper changed from using RunPE to exploiting\nCreateTimerQueueTimer. CreateTimerQueueTimer is a Windows application programming\ninterface (API) that creates a [queue for timers. These timers are lightweight objects that](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms686796(v=vs.85).aspx)\n[enable the selection of a callback function at a specified time. The original function of the API](https://www.cyphort.com/hancitors-exploitation-of-win32-apis/)\nis to be part of the process chain by creating a timer routine, but here, the callback function\n\n\n-----\n\nof the API becomes EMOTET s actual payload. EMOTET seems to have traded RunPE for a\nWindows API because the exploitation of the former has become popular while the latter is\nlesser known, theoretically making it more difficult to detect by security scanners.\n\n[Figure 1. A CreateTimerQueueTimer API document](https://blog.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/migrated/security-intelligence-migration-spreadsheet/trendlabs-security-intelligence/2017/11/171114Emotet_01.jpg)\n\n_Figure 1. A CreateTimerQueueTimer API document (from_ _[CreateTimerQueueTimer function)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/zh-tw/library/windows/desktop/ms682485(v=vs.85).aspx)_\n\n[Figure 2. When the EMOTET dropper executes at Stage 4](https://blog.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/migrated/security-intelligence-migration-spreadsheet/trendlabs-security-intelligence/2017/11/171114Emotet_02.jpg)\n\n_Figure 2. When the EMOTET dropper executes at Stage 4, the Stage 5 payload at 0x_\n_0x428310 will be injected to CreateTimerQueueTimer._\n\nThis is not the first malware we've seen abusing CreateTimerQueueTimer. [Hancitor, a](https://success.trendmicro.com/solution/1115383-emerging-threat-on-hancitor))\n[banking Trojan that dropped PONY and VAWTRAK, also exploited the API in its dropper,](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/banking-malware-vawtrak-now-uses-malicious-macros-abuses-windows-powershell/)\nwhich is a malicious macro document.\n\n**_Anti-Analysis and Anti-Sandbox Techniques_**\n\nWe also observed a new behavior in this variant, which is its anti-analysis technique. Some\nmalware are designed to sleep for a period of time to avoid detection from malware analysis\nproducts. The analysis platform will change its sleep period to a very short time to scan for\nmalicious activities. EMOTET’s anti-analysis technique involves checking when the scanner\nmonitors activities to dodge detection. CreateTimerQueueTimer helps EMOTET do the job\nevery 0x3E8 milliseconds.\n\nThis variant has the ability to check if it’s inside a sandbox environment at the second stage\nof its payload. The EMOTET loader will not proceed if it sees that it’s running inside a\nsandbox environment.\n\nThe dropper will check for the following to discern whether it is running in a sandbox\nenvironment:\n\nWhen NetBIOS’ name is TEQUILABOOMBOOM.\nWhen UserName is Wilber, NetBIOS’ name starts with SC, and NetBIOS name starts\nwith CW.\nWhen UserName is admin, DnsHostName is SystemIT, and if there’s a Debugger\nsymbol file like C:\\\\Symbols\\aagmmc.pdb.\nWhen Username is admin, and NetBIOS name is KLONE_X64-PC\nWhen UserName is John Doe.\nWhen UserName is John and there are two files called C:\\\\take_screenshot.ps1 and\nC:\\\\loaddll.exe.\nWhen these files are present: C:\\\\email.doc, C:\\\\123\\\\email.doc, and\nC:\\\\123\\\\\\email.docx.\nWhen these files are present: C:\\\\a\\\\foobar.bmp, C:\\\\a\\\\foobar.doc, and C:\\\\a\\\\foobar.gif.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3. When sample files are named sample., mlwr_smple. or artifact.exe, the malicious\npayload will also not be launched.\n\n_Figure 3. When sample files are named sample., mlwr_smple. or artifact.exe, the malicious_\n_payload will also not be launched._\n\nAs part of its unpacking technique, this variant will run itself through another process if it\ndoes not have admin privilege. If the process has admin privilege, it will proceed with the\nfollowing:\n\n1. Create new service as an auto start to make malware persistent\n2. Change the service description to “Provides support for 3rd party protocol plug-ins for\n\nInternet Connection Sharing.”\n3. Start the service.\n4. Collect system information such as process name and system information\n5. Encrypt the collected information via the AES-128 algorithm and SHA1 hash algorithm.\n6. Encrypt the information and POST at the C&C server.\n\nFigure 4. EMOTET collects system process information (left) and saves the result to\nmemory (right)\n\n_Figure 4.

The variant’s infection chain_\n\nThe infection chain of this variant starts with a phishing email. The email contains a malicious\nURL that will drop a document file containing a malicious macro.\n\n[Figure 8.

Users should always be cautious of individuals or](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/best-practices-identifying-and-mitigating-phishing-attacks)\norganizations that ask for personal information. Most companies will not ask for sensitive\ndata from its customers. When in doubt, users should verify with the company to avoid any\npotential issues. Users should also avoid clicking links or downloading files even if they come\nfrom seemingly “trustworthy” sources. In addition, enterprises can stay protected by\n[employing strong security policies to their email gateway and ensuring that their network](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/infosec-guide-email-threats)\ninfrastructure can filter, validate, and block malicious traffic like anomalous data exfiltration.\n\n**_Trend Micro Solutions_**\n\nCombating threats against the likes of EMOTET call for a multilayered and proactive\n[approach to security—from the gateway,](https://blog.trendmicro.com/en_us/business/products/user-protection/sps.html) [endpoints,](https://blog.trendmicro.com/en_us/business/products/user-protection/sps.html) [networks, and](https://blog.trendmicro.com/en_us/business/products/network/advanced-threat-protection.html) [servers.
