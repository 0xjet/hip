The VBS contacts the C2 and fetches the payload.\n**deep-sunken.exe – The downloaded payload which executes to drop four more files**\non the compromised computer: baby.cmd, baby.dat, basement.exe (wget binary),\nvb_baby.vbs. A new scheduled task is created and the C2 is contacted again for the\nnext payload.\n**z4z05jn4.egf.exe – Next-stage payload which is similar to the previous one but**\nfeatures different C2, drops files in different folders, and uses different filenames.\n**defiant.exe – Executes to drop VBS files onto “%TEMP%\\\\deep-versed.nls” and**\n“%PUBLIC\\Pictures\\deep-versed.nls”, and then create a scheduled task for their\nexecution.\n**deep-green.exe – UltraVNC remote administration tool that connects to a repeater.**\n**deep-green.exe – Process Explorer binary for Microsoft Windows.**\n**deep-green.exe – Same as defiant.exe but with different hard-coded C2 and**\nfilenames.\n**deep-green.exe – Drops VBS in “%PUBLIC%\\Music\\” and creates a scheduled task**\nthat searchers for removable drives on the infected system.\n\nOther indicators of compromise include C2 URLs and IPs allocated by the AS9123\nTimeWeb Ltd., and they all use a unique URI structure as shown below:\n\nhttp + IP + /.php?=, OR\nhttp + IP + /.php?=,\nAlso, the most common directories that host malicious files are:\n\ncsidl_profile\\links\ncsidl_profile\\searches\nCSIDL_PROFILE\\appdata\\local\\temp\\\nCSIDL_PROFILE\\\n\nThe Symantec report also concludes that many of the dropped files have unknown parent\nprocess hashes which weren’t analyzed, so parts of the Gamaredon operation remain\nunclear.\n\nFile hashes for the new malware payloads discovered by Symantec can be found in\ntheir report.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Ukraine warns of “chemical attack” phishing pushing stealer malware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ukraine-warns-of-chemical-attack-phishing-pushing-stealer-malware/)\n\n[Russian state hackers hit Ukraine with new malware variants](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/russian-state-hackers-hit-ukraine-with-new-malware-variants/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Sandworm hackers fail to take down Ukrainian energy provider](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/sandworm-hackers-fail-to-take-down-ukrainian-energy-provider/)\n\n[Ukraine: Russian Armageddon phishing targets EU govt agencies](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ukraine-russian-armageddon-phishing-targets-eu-govt-agencies/)\n\n[Russian hackers perform reconnaissance against Austria, Estonia](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/russian-hackers-perform-reconnaissance-against-austria-estonia/)\n\n[Gamaredon](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/gamaredon/)\n[Hacker](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/hacker/)\n[Malware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/malware/)\n[Russia](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/russia/)\n[Ukraine](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ukraine/)\n\n[Bill Toulas](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/bill-toulas/)\n\nBill Toulas is a technology writer and infosec news reporter with over a decade of\nexperience working on various online publications.
