The attack starts with the potential victim\nperforming a search for business forms such as invoices, questionnaires, and receipts.\n[Unlike the LinkedIn spearphishing campaign eSentire reported last week that utilized email](https://www.esentire.com/security-advisories/hackers-spearphish-professionals-on-linkedin-with-fake-job-offers-infecting-them-with-malware-warns-esentire)\nand LinkedIn channels, this campaign lays long-standing traps for victims using Google\n**search redirection and the drive-by- download method. Once the RAT is on the victim’s**\ncomputer and activated, the threat actors can send commands and upload additional\nmalware to the infected system, such as ransomware, a credential stealer, a banking trojan,\nor simply use the RAT as a foothold into the victim’s network.\n\n\n-----\n\nUpon attempting to download the alleged document template, users are redirected,\nunknowingly, to a malicious website where the RAT malware is hosted. eSentire’s Threat\nResponse Unit (TRU) discovered over 100,000 unique web pages that contain popular\nbusiness terms/particular keywords: template, invoice, receipt, questionnaire, and resume. In\na precursory search, 70,000 unique web pages included the mention of either template or\n_invoice. These common business terms serve as keywords for the threat actors’ search_\noptimization strategy, convincing Google’s web crawler that the intended content meets\nconditions for a high PageRank score.\n\nOnce the target lands on a site controlled by the hacker, the page shows download buttons\nfor the document template they were searching. When clicked, the business professional is\nredirected (unknowingly) to a malicious website which serves up an executable disguised as\na pdf document or a word document. In the incident which eSentire investigated, when the\nexecutable (disguised as a pdf) was launched by the user, they simultaneously installed the\nSolarMarker RAT (also referred to as Yellow Cockatoo, Jupyter, and Polazert) and a\ncomplimentary copy of the Slim PDF reader application. Slim PDF is a legitimate application\nfor reading pdfs. The pdf reader application is installed by the threat actors, either in an effort\nto convince the victim of the legitimacy of the document they were seeking or as a distraction\nfrom the installation of the RAT. As with any RAT, once SolarMarker is active, the threat\nactors can send commands and upload additional files to the infected system. The TRU has\nnot yet observed actions-on-objectives following a SolarMarker infection, but suspect any\nnumber of possibilities, including ransomware, credential theft, fraud, or as a foothold into the\nvictim networks for espionage or exfiltration operations.\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\nA Remote Access Trojan (RAT) with many names: Tracked as SolarMarker, Jupyter,\nYellow Cockatoo and Polazert\nThe threat actors behind SolarMarker have added Slim PDF to their list of decoy\napplications\nSwitched from search redirection, via Shopify, to search redirection via Google Sites\n\n## Comment from Spence Hutchinson, Manager of Threat Intelligence for eSentire\n\n“Security leaders and their teams need to know that the threat group behind SolarMarker has\ngone to a lot of effort to compromise business professionals, spreading a wide net and using\nmany tactics to successfully disguise their traps,” said Spence Hutchinson, Manager of\nThreat Intelligence for eSentire. “For instance, the Solar Marker group has:\n\n:\n\n\n-----\n\nDeployed over 100,000 web pages via Google Sites. The benefits of being hosted on\nGoogle’s infrastructure are several. First, Google is trusted by both security appliances\nand human eyes. Secondly, it probably doesn't hurt your PageRank score with Google\nto use Google’s infrastructure. The pages are also padded with generated text\nkeywords, a tactic likely used to further influence search results.\nThe threat actors have created tens of hundreds of web pages with popular business\nterms, such as invoice, statement, receipt, questionnaire, so that when a business\nprofessional is searching the Internet for a specific business template, then there is a\nchance that the top search results will include one of their malicious pages.\nThe infection process relies on exploiting the user, not an application. The user simply\nexecutes a binary disguised as a PDF to infect the machine. This is an increasingly\ncommon trend with malware delivery, which speaks to the improved security of\napplications such as browsers that handle vulnerable code. Unfortunately, it reveals a\nglaring blindspot in controls which allow users to execute untrusted binaries or script\nfiles at will.\nThe SolarMarker campaign utilizes a variety of decoy applications. Most recently, TRU\nobserved that the Slim PDF reader software was the decoy being downloaded onto the\nvictim’s computer. This serves as a distraction, as well as an additional element to help\nconvince the victim that they are downloading a pdf.\n\n“Another troubling aspect of this campaign is that the SolarMarker group has populated\nmany of their malicious web pages with keywords relating to financial documents, e.g.,\nstatements, receipts, invoices, etc.,” continued Hutchinson.. “A financial cybercrime group\nwould consider an employee, working in the finance department of a company, or an\nemployee, working for a financial organization, a high value target. In fact, the SolarMarker\nincident which eSentire disrupted involved an employee of a financial management\ncompany. Once a remote access trojan (RAT) has been installed on a victim’s computer, the\nthreat actors can upload additional malware to the device, such as a banking trojan, which\ncould be used to hijack the online banking credentials of the organization. Or a credential\nstealer could be installed, which could be used to steal the employee’s email credentials,\nenabling the hackers to launch a business email compromise scheme. Unfortunately, once a\nRAT is comfortably installed, the potential fraud activities are numerous.”\n\n## How the Attack Works\n\nThe emerging RAT is written with the .NET software framework, and tracked as Jupyter,\n_Yellow Cockatoo, SolarMarker, and now being tracked as Polazert on twitter [1]. SolarMarker_\nwas first observed by eSentire in early October 2020. The eSentire Threat Response Unit\n(TRU) tracks this threat as SolarMarker due to the observed tracking file dropped for host\nidentification. Throughout October and November 2020, SolarMarker utilized docx2rtf.exe as\na decoy to distract users as the .NET silently installed itself in the background. Red Canary\nreports SolarMarker changing this decoy application throughout the following months [4]\n\n\n-----\n\nusing in September 2020 photodesigner7_x86-64.exe and Expert_PDF.exe in November\n2020, while the TRU continued to see docx2rtf.exe. The TRU has now discovered that the\nSolarMarker group is using Slim PDF Reader. See Figure 1 and Figure 2.\n\nFigure 1. The attack chain starts with a google search and ends in the installation of\nSolarMarker and lesser-known PDF viewer.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2: Process tree outlining the installation of SolarMarker. Note the Adobe icon on the\ninstaller file. The RAT, labeled (unknown), then goes on to install the decoy document and\nmake malicious PowerShell calls.\n\nSolarMarker captures victims via Google Search redirect. Often, clients are looking for a free\nversion or template of a document. In the latest incident observed by TRU, the victim, who\nworks in the financial industry, was redirected to a Google Sites page controlled by the threat\nactor with an embedded download button. The download button, hosted at\npassiondiamond[.]site, is easy to customize. The TRU team was able to generate a\ndocument named “this is a test” for download (Figure 3). Note the search redirect content\n(see Figure 4) populated on the malicious web page just below the download buttons in\nFigure 3.\n\nFigure 3: The Download button that is embedded in the Google Site\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4: The search redirect content populated on the malicious web page just below the\ndownload buttons in figure 3.\n\nFigure 5: Examining the source of the embedded button page reveals a link to a .tk domain\nand icon sources\n\nThe decoy program, Slim PDF, serves as an important visual cue for potential victims of\nSolarMarker but also helps to lower suspicion of malicious intent. The attached screenshot\n(Figure 6) is from the Slim PDF website\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6: Screenshot from the Slim PDF reader website\n\n## Evolution of Distribution Method\n\neSentire's TRU first saw SolarMarker utilizing Shopify for its search redirection method in\nOctober 2020. In that case, the redirection infrastructure was embedded in a hosted PDF\nthat provided links to the threat actor’s maliciously controlled infrastructure where the RAT\n(and its decoy payloads) is hosted. In 2021, the redirection method shifted to Google Sites.\n\nThe redirection method for Shopify was highlighted by Security Magic [5] who also\nmentioned the usage of Google Sites. To capture search results, the threat actors loaded the\nredirection content with keywords. In the case of Shopify, the keywords were hidden as white\ntext at the bottom of the PDF (Figure 7). In recent attacks, however, Google Sites is being\nleveraged with an embedded download button (Figure 3) that leads to attacker-controlled\ninfrastructure. As with the Shopify PDF, a block of text with keywords is included. In the case\nof Google Sites, the keyword content is placed directly in the site, below the landing button\n\n\n-----\n\nand some white space (Figure 4).\n\nFigure 7: Highlighting the second page of the Shopify-hosted PDF reveals the hidden text\nused to rank high in Google results\n\n## Redirection\n\nThe redirection infrastructure passes through a series of .tk TLDs before landing on the final\n.ml TLD domain. See Figure 8. Upon visiting the infrastructure with a VM, no such redirects\nare experienced. Upon inspecting the source code of the embedded download button at\npassiondiamond.site, researchers found an entirely different .tk domain, indicating a\npossibility that these redirect pathways are dynamic and can be changed for either\noperational security or delivery efficacy. It’s possible that any number of checks are being\nperformed on the visiting browser and operating system to ensure they are being operated\nby victims, not security researchers.\n\nFigure 8: SolarMarker’s redirect path from the search result to the final payload site\n\n\n-----\n\n## Four Names, One Malware\n\n[1] Mar 09, 2021 - [https://twitter.com/JAMESWT_MHT](https://twitter.com/JAMESWT_MHT)\n\nBeing tracked as #Polazert\n\n[2] Feb 08, 2021 - https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/solarmarker-backdoor-technicalanalysis/\n\nGoogle Sites mentioned\n\nInfection Chain Shown\n\nDetailed Reversing / Snippets\n\n[3] Dec 12, 2020 - http://security5magics.blogspot.com/2020/12/tracking-jupytermalware.html\n\nShows Shopify Method\n\nGoogle Sites mentioned\n\n[4] Dec 04, 2020 - [https://redcanary.com/blog/yellow-cockatoo/](https://redcanary.com/blog/yellow-cockatoo/)\n\nOverview of Decoys used\n\n[5] Nov 12, 2020 - [https://blog.morphisec.com/jupyter-infostealer-backdoor-introduction](https://blog.morphisec.com/jupyter-infostealer-backdoor-introduction)\n\nFirst Public Report on SolarMarker\n\n## SolarMarker Incident Dissection:\n\n1.
