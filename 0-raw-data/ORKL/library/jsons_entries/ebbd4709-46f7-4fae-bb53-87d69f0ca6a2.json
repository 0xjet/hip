These applications pretended to be genuine AV solutions\nwhile in reality they downloaded and installed an Android Stealer called Sharkbot.\n\nSharkbot steals credentials and banking information. The malware implements a geofencing\nfeature and evasion techniques that makes it stand out in the field. It also makes use of\n**Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA), an aspect rarely used in the world of Android**\nmalware. Sharkbot lures victims to enter their credentials in windows that mimic benign\ncredential input forms. When the user enters credentials in these windows, the compromised\ndata is sent to a malicious server.\n\n\n-----\n\nSharkbot has a handful of tricks up its sleeve. It doesn t target every potential victim it\nencounters, but only select ones, using the geofencing feature to identify and ignore users\nfrom China, India, Romania, Russia, Ukraine or Belarus.\n\n_Figure 1 -Geofencing feature as implemented in Sharkbot._\n\nEvasion techniques are also a part of Sharkbot’s arsenal. If the malware detects it is running\nin a sandbox, it stops the execution and quits.\n\n_Figure 2 – Evasion technique encountered in Sharkbot._\n\nIn the Google Play store, we spotted a total of six different applications that were spreading\nSharkbot.\n\n_Figure 3 – Icons and names of the applications we found._\n\nThese six applications came from three developer accounts, `Zbynek Adamcik,` `Adelmio`\n```\nPagnotto and Bingo Like Inc . When we checked the history of these accounts, we saw\n\n```\nthat two of them were active in the fall of 2021. Some of the applications linked to these\n\n\n_Figure 3 – Icons and names of the applications we found._\n\n\n_Figure 1 -Geofencing feature as implemented in Sharkbot._\n\n\n-----\n\naccounts were removed from Google Play, but still exist in unofficial markets. This could\nmean that the actor behind the applications is trying to stay under the radar while still\ninvolved in malicious activity.\n\nThe applications removed from Google Play were downloaded and installed approximately\n[15 thousand times. Following information we got from www.appbrain.com.](https://www.appbrain.com/)\n\n_Figure 4 – Statistics of the developers’ accounts. Unpublished applications are outlined._\n\nAfter spotting the applications that spread Sharkbot, we immediately contacted Google and\nreported our findings. After a fast yet thorough examination, all the applications that were\nfound spreading Sharkbot were permanently removed from the Google Play store.\n\nHowever, the Sharkbot malware is still active. In this article, we provide a deep technical\nanalysis of Sharkbot and reveal the steps that helped us to spot the malware-spreading\napplications on Google Play.\n\n## Timeline\n\nFebruary 25, 2022 – We discovered 4 applications of SharkBot Dropper on Google\nPlay.\nMarch 03, 2022 – We reported Google about found applications.\nMarch 03, 2022 – NCC Group published their research on Sharkbot Dropper.\nMarch 09, 2022 – Reported applications removed from Google Play.\n\n\n_Figure 4 – Statistics of the developers’ accounts. Unpublished applications are outlined._\n\n\n-----\n\nMarch 15, 2022 – One more SharkBot dropper discovered on Google Play, 0+ installs.\nSame day we reported this application to Google.\nMarch 22, 2022 – One more SharkBot dropper discovered on Google Play, 0+ installs.\nSame day we reported this application to Google.\nMarch 27, 2022 – newly found SharkBot dropper’s removed from Google Play.\n\n## Technical analysis\n\nWe already mentioned that Sharkbot implements evasion techniques and a geofencing\nfeature, but these are not its only noteworthy tricks. Another distinctive aspect present in\nSharkbot is the use of DGA, which is rarely seen in Android malware. With DGA, one sample\nwith a hardcoded seed generates 7 domains per week. Including all the seeds and\nalgorithms we have observed, there is a total of 56 domains per week, i.e., 8 different\ncombinations of seed/algorithm.\n\nSpeaking of its main functionality, Sharkbot implements the traditional toolkit for Android\nbankers and stealers. As a vivid example, we saw the abuse of the Accessibility Service\nwhich provides the application with access to all the data which is seen by the user and also\nallows the application to interact with an interface as though as it were a person.\n\nDuring our observations, 27 versions of the bot were discovered. The main differences\nbetween the versions are different DGA seeds as well as different botnetID and ownerID\nfields. For more information on the different versions and a change log, see the Appendix.\n\n## Commands\n\nThe Sharkbot malware implements a total of 22 commands that allow various kinds of\nmalicious actions to be executed by a Command-and-Control server (CnC) on the infected\ndevice.\n\nThis table shows the commands used and their descriptions:\n\n**№** **Command** **Description**\n\n1 smsSend Requests permission for sending SMS.\n\n2 updateLib Downloads and stores a jar file with java code.\n\n3 updateSQL Updates a given option in local DB.\n\n4 updateConfig Updates the different options.\n\n5 uninstallApp Uninstalls a given application.\n\n6 collectContacts Sends the contacts list to the server.\n\n\n-----\n\n7 changeSmsAdmin For the user to change the default SMS manager.\n\n8 getDoze Disables the battery optimization, so Sharkbot can run in\nbackground\n\n9 sendInject Creates the “Injection” window from a given URL.\n\n10 iWantA11 For the user to enable Sharkbot as Accessibility Service.\n\n11 updateTimeKnock Updates the “TIME_KNOCK_ADMIN” option.\n\n12 sendPush Displays a PUSH-notification for the user.\n\n13 APP_STOP_VIEW Prevents the user from activating the application.\n\n14 Swipe Imitate the user’s swipe over the device’s screen.\n\n15 autoReply Sets up an autoreply message on Push-notifications.\n\n16 removeApp Silently uninstalls a given application.\n\n17 serviceSMS Sends SMS messages to the provided phone numbers with a\nprovided text.\n\n18 getNotify Turns on Notification Listener permission for the Sharkbot\napplication.\n\n19 localATS Starts given applications and logs all Accessibility Events.\n\n20 sendSMS Sends an SMS with given text to a given number.\n\n21 downloadFile Downloads a file from provided URL and stores it locally with an\nAPK extension.\n\n22 stopAll A command is transferred to the jar-file, dropped with the\nupdateLib command.\n\nIf unknown command arrives from server, then this command is sent to jar-file, dropped with\n```\nupdateLib command.\n\n```\nBelow we provide a more detailed description of the commands supported by the malware.\n\n### smsSend\n\nChecks if permission for sending SMSs is granted. If not, then the user is asked to grant\npermission to send and read SMSs.\n\n### updateLib\n\n\n-----\n\nWith this command, the CnC sends code for overlay injects for the user s applications. The\ncode is saved to a local jar-file. We named this module jarMod. The CnC can send\ncommands to jarMod, including updateConfig, changeSmsAdmin and any uncategorized\ncommand.\n\n_Figure 5 – Code block of executable dropper._\n\n### updateSQL\n\n**Sharkbot stores local configuration in an SQLite DB (database) in the file** `database.db or`\n```\nsharked.db located at the path /data/data/<package_name>/databases/ . Values in\n\n```\nthe DB are stored in encrypted form.\n\n_Figure 6 – Example of a local database._\n\nWith the help of the updateSQL command values in the database can be updated.\n\n### updateConfig\n\nWith this command, the CnC address and the name of the application for injection can be\nupdated:\n\n\n_Figure 5 – Code block of executable dropper._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7 – Storing new configuration._\n\n### uninstallApp\n\nUninstalls the application with the provided package name:\n\n_Figure 8 – Uninstalling an application._\n\n### collectContacts\n\nCollects and sends contacts to the server.\n\n### changeSmsAdmin\n\nSends the name of old and currently default SMS applications to the CnC, and sends a\ncommand to the previously downloaded jar code (see updateLib command).\n\n_Figure 9 – Handler of the changeSmsAdmin command._\n\n### getDoze\n\nUsed to disable battery optimization for Sharkbot’s package.\n\n\n_Figure 7 – Storing new configuration._\n\n\n_Figure 9 – Handler of the changeSmsAdmin command._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 10 – Disabling battery optimization for the Sharkbot application._\n\n### sendInject\n\nPerforms overlay inject with a form from a provided URL.\n\n_Figure 11 – Performing inject._\n\n### iWantA11\n\nUsed to enable the Accessibility Service for Sharkbot:\n\n_Figure 12 – To enable the Accessibility Service for Sharkbot._\n\n### updateTimeKnock\n\nSet the field “TIME_KNOCK_ADMIN” in the local DB to the provided value.\n\n_Figure 13 – Updating knock time._\n\n### sendPush\n\nShows the user a push message with provided text.\n\n_Figure 14 – Code to show a push-message to the user._\n\n\n_Figure 11 – Performing inject._\n\n\n_Figure 10 – Disabling battery optimization for the Sharkbot application._\n\n\n_Figure 14 – Code to show a push-message to the user._\n\n\n-----\n\n### APP_STOP_VIEW\n\nWith this command, the CnC sets up package names for which the Accessibility Service\nprevents the user from accessing these applications:\n\n_Figure 15 – Prevent the user from accessing an application._\n\nBy default, 2 package names are used: `com.android.settings and`\n\n\n_Figure 15 – Prevent the user from accessing an application._\n\n```\ncom.samsung.accessibility\n\n```\n\n_Figure 16 – Default applications to prevent access._\n\n### Swipe\n\nWith this command Sharkbot can imitate the user’s swipe over the device’s screen:\n\n_Figure 17 – Emulating swipe sequences._\n\nThis appears as if it was designed to unlock an application or the whole device.\n\n\n_Figure 17 – Emulating swipe sequences._\n\n\n-----\n\n### autoReply\n\nThis is not an actual command, but a field in the `updateConfig` command. With the\nautoReply field, the server sends a message to imitate an answer on push events. The\ncommand consists of an array with two fields in each element of the array:\n\n_Figure 18 – Example of the autoReply field._\n\nIt is possible to set different messages for each application. On Figure 18, you can see\nmessages for two different applications: WhatsApp messenger and Facebook messenger.\n\nIn Figure 18, we caught the test period for the development of the autoreply feature. We can\nsay that because both messages target www.google.com.\n\nYou can also use one message for all notifications. Here is a variant from the production\nusage:\n\n_Figure 19 – One message for all notifications._\n\n### removeApp\n\nThis is not a command, but a field of the `updateConfig command. With the` `removeApp`\ncommand, the server sends a huge list of applications which should be uninstalled from the\nuser’s device. At present, this list contains 680 applications.\n\n_Figure 20 – Uninstalling applications._\n\n## Network\n\n\n_Figure 20 – Uninstalling applications._\n\n\n_Figure 19 – One message for all notifications._\n\n\n-----\n\nThere are very few types of malware that can work without communicating with a CnC\nserver; stealers and bankers are the ones which can’t. If a malware operator has several\nservers, then it’s easy to block access to them either by a corporate firewall, or with the AV\nsoftware installed on the device. After the CnCs are blocked, an operator can change the\ndomain name of the CnC server but how are already installed clients supposed to learn\nabout the server change? This is where Domain Generation Algorithm enters the scene.\n\nDGA is an algorithm by which a malicious client and malicious actor can change the CnC\nserver in concert, without any communication. DGA is a piece of code which runs on a client\nand generates dynamic names for the CnC server, so if today one CnC server is blocked\nthen within a day, a week or a month, a new name for the CnC will be generated and used.\nThis algorithm complicates the process of blocking malware operators’ servers.\n\nUsually DGA consists of two parts: the actual algorithm, and the constants used by the\nalgorithm. These constants are called DGA seeds.\n\nAs we mentioned earlier, implementing DGA is rarely observed in Android malware, but\nSharkbot is an exception.\n\nBefore the connection to the DGA domains is made, Sharkbot attempts to connect to the\nstatic URL hardcoded inside:\n\n_Figure 21 – Static CnC URL._\n\nOnly if the static server does not respond, Sharkbot uses an embedded DGA procedure to\nget relevant domains for the current date and then attempts to connect to them one by one:\n\n_Figure 22 – DGA code._\n\nThe final string for DGA consists of several fields:\n\nCurrent year (using since 02.09.2022)\nCurrent week number\nseed-word\nKey `pojBI9LHGFdfgegjjsJ99hvVGHVOjhksdf`\n\nWe noticed that the seed-word is changed across samples. We caught the following variants:\n\n\n_Figure 22 – DGA code._\n\n\n-----\n\nsharked\n“traff”\n“jarmi”\n“” (no word)\n\n_Figure 23 – Using seeds in domain name generation._\n\n### Protocol\n\nThe exchange with the CnC server happens over HTTP with POST request on path /. Each\nrequest and answer is encrypted with RC4. The key for RC4 is transferred encrypted with the\nRSA public key. The request consists of 2 fields:\n\n**rkey: Used to transfer the RC4 encryption key. The key is encrypted with the RSA**\npublic key.\n**rdata: Used for data, encrypted with RC4.**\n\n_Figure 24 – RAW request to the server._\n\nThe answer consists of the encrypted data only.\n\n\n_Figure 23 – Using seeds in domain name generation._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 25 – RAW answer from the server._\n\nIn a clean view protocol you can find the JSON data. The bot acts as a client, and the CnC\nacts as a server. A typical request from the bot looks like this:\n\n_Figure 26 – Clear request to the server._\n\nWhen a server has no commands to send, it answers with “ok”:\n\n_Figure 27 – Server answer without command._\n\nWhen a server has commands for the bot, the answer looks like this:\n\n_Figure 28 – Server answer with command._\n\nThese are the fields in the answer:\n```\n   dataCommand : Type of packet.\n   command : Type of command.\n   CommandID : We observed this field is increased by one for every command, and is\n\n```\nsent by the server.\n```\n   data : Command data, whose contents depend on the type of command.\n\n```\n\n_Figure 26 – Clear request to the server._\n\n\n_Figure 25 – RAW answer from the server._\n\n\n-----\n\n### Keep alive\n\nPeriodically, with a fixed period of time, the bot sends a knock-packet to the server. By\ndefault, this packet is sent every 30 seconds. The server can change the time period with\nthe command `updateTimeKnock . Here is how a knock-packet looks :`\n\n_Figure 29 – Keep-alive packet._\n\nThe value for a `knock field is chosen at random:`\n\n_Figure 30 – Choosing the knock value._\n\n## Infrastructure\n\nAt the time of publication, we counted 8 IP addresses which were Sharkbot’s CnC servers at\ndifferent times. During our research of the infrastructure, we spotted a field `commandID` in\nsome answers from the server. This field is used to identify each command sent from the\nserver to the client.\n\nAfter more detailed analysis, we can assume that this field is increased by one for each\ncommand sent from the server. During our experiments, we noticed that this value does not\ndepend on the particular CnC server but instead is a common value for all of them.\n\nHere are the logs of the requests and response exchange with different servers on January\n25 2022 one after the other:\n\n\n_Figure 30 – Choosing the knock value._\n\n\n-----\n\nServer `mnbvakjjouxir0zkzmd[.]xyz with IP` `31[.]214.157.112 :`\n\n_Figure 31 – Request to the server, at 15:45:12.487._\n\n_Figure 32 – Answer from the server, at 15:45:13.80._\n\nServer `mjaynxbvakjjouxir0z[.]xyz with IP` `109[.]230.199.99 :`\n\n_Figure 33 – Request to the server, at 15:48:06.448._\n\n_Figure 34 – Answer from the server, at 15:48:07.45._\n\nAs you can see, the value of `commandID changed by exactly one. From this we can`\nassume even more:\n\nThere is one real server, and the others work as relays.\nWe can use the values of the field `commandID to evaluate the activity of the server`\nsending commands to clients.\n\n\n_Figure 33 – Request to the server, at 15:48:06.448._\n\n\n_Figure 32 – Answer from the server, at 15:45:13.80._\n\n\n-----\n\nUsing the value of the commandID field, we can estimate the activity of Sharkbot s servers.\nWe calculated an average increase of the commandID value per hour for the period from\nJanuary 26 to March 23 and got the following result:\n\n_Figure 35 – Sharkbot server activity._\n\nWe can see that activity increased, with the peak at the beginning of March. This correlates\nwith the active use of Sharkbot’s dropper on Google Play.\n\nThe following chart shows the number of unique IP addresses encountered in the period\nfrom February 14 to February 20:\n\nBlue bars denote the count of unique IP addresses per day.\nRed bars denote the count of unique IP addresses, excluding the ones already seen in\nthe previous days.\n\n\n_Figure 35 – Sharkbot server activity._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 36 – Unique IP addressed statistics observed in the middle of February._\n\nDuring our observation for this particular week in February, we saw approximately one\nthousand unique IP addresses in total.\n\nThe following chart shows the location-based statistics. The main targets are Italy and the\nUnited Kingdom.\n\n\n_Figure 36 – Unique IP addressed statistics observed in the middle of February._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 37 – Regional statistics._\n\n## Droppers\n\nNow that we described different aspects of Sharkbot, to complete the picture, we discuss the\nmethods by which Sharkbot spreads. As mentioned at the beginning, the malware is\ndownloaded and installed by the dropper applications in Google Play which masquerade as\nAV solutions. These are the applications:\n\ncom.abbondioendrizzi.tools.supercleaner\ncom.abbondioendrizzi.antivirus.supercleaner\ncom.pagnotto28.sellsourcecode.alpha\ncom.pagnotto28.sellsourcecode.supercleaner\ncom.antivirus.centersecurity.freeforall\ncom.centersecurity.android.cleaner\n\nThey have some additional tricks.\n\nThe droppers detect emulators and quit if one is found. No communications with CnC are\nstarted in this case:\n\n\n_Figure 37 – Regional statistics._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 38 – Emulation evasion and region restrict code._\n\nThere is also a geofencing technique implemented inside the droppers, as can be seen in\nthe image above. The malicious part of the applications is not triggered if the locale is set to\nChina, India, Romania, Russia, Ukraine or Belarus.\n\nThe part of the application controlled by the CnC server understands 3 commands:\n\n**b: Download and install the APK file from the provided URL.**\n**c: Store the autoReply field in a local session.**\n**d: Restart the execution of the local session.**\n\nAll of these applications request the same set of permissions:\n\n_Figure 39 – Permissions._\n\nThe applications register the service to get access to Accessibility Events:\n\n\n_Figure 39 – Permissions._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 40 – Accessibility Service description._\n\nBelow we describe the key parts of the malicious code in the applications.\n\n### Accessibility Service\n\nWith this command from the CnC, an application can abuse the Accessibility Service for its\nown needs. The Accessibility Service is able to execute different “tasks”, which are extracted\nfrom the Intent:\n\n_Figure 41 – Setting up the Accessibility Service “task.”_\n\nThis “task” is later used in the event’s dispatcher. For example:\n\n_Figure 42 – Accessibility Service “task” dispatching._\n\nThe “task” describes which actions should be performed for particular events. For example,\nthe default “task” looks like this:\n\n\n_Figure 42 – Accessibility Service “task” dispatching._\n\n\n_Figure 40 – Accessibility Service description._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 43 – Accessibility Service “task” by default._\n\nThis “task” instructs the Accessibility dispatcher to perform a `CLICK on a node, which`\ncontains a text `Alfa Antivirus, Cleaner .`\n\nThe Accessibility dispatcher supports the following actions:\n\n**CLICK: Performs click-action, on a chosen control.**\n\n**SCROLL_BACKWARD: Performs back-action, on a chosen control.**\n\n**intent: Performs permission request for:**\n```\n   android.settings.MANAGE_UNKNOWN_APP_SOURCES or\n   android.settings.action.MANAGE_OVERLAY_PERMISSION\n\n```\nDuring the execution of a given “task”, every event is sent to the CnC:\n\n_Figure 44 – Sending an Accessibility event to the CnC server._\n\n### APK install\n\nThe malware can drop and install the APK file on the user’s device:\n\n\n_Figure 43 – Accessibility Service “task” by default._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 45 – Code to install the application._\n\n_Figure 46 – Code to drop the application._\n\n### Notifications\n\n\n_Figure 46 – Code to drop the application._\n\n\n-----\n\nThe stored field `autoReply works the same way as` `autoReply for Sharkbot, as`\ndescribed earlier. Malware answers with a message provided by the CnC to application,\nwhich generates a push notification.\n\n## Dropper Summary\n\nAs we can judge by the functionality of the droppers, their possibilities clearly pose a threat\nby themselves, beyond just dropping the malware. The droppers are able to inspect and act\non all the UI events of the device as well as replace notifications sent by other applications.\nIn addition, they can install an APK downloaded from the CnC, which provides a convenient\nstarting point to spread the malware as soon as the user installs such an application on the\ndevice.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn the ever-changing contemporary (cyber-)world, nothing should be taken for granted. If a\nnew AV solution appears in Google Play today, there’s no way to guarantee it won’t turn out\nto be a malware spreading threat tomorrow. This is the exact case we observed with the\nSharkbot malware.\n\nIn this spreading scheme, the malware itself is not uploaded to Google Play but rather the\nintermediate link is, which masquerades as a legitimate software. As we can see by more\nthan 15,000 installations for all the applications in total, people can be lured by a beautiful\nicon and a promise to “protect their devices.”\n\nThe Check Point Research Team is constantly monitoring this and other threats in the mobile\nlandscape, and we immediately notified Google of the malicious behavior we encountered.\nDespite a fast response from Google, which removed applications linked to threat actor\naccounts, more attempts were made in Google Play with more droppers from different\naccounts. They were all subsequently removed as well, but the damage from 15,000\nthousand installations was already done.\n\nGoogle Play Protect’s solid reputation should not decrease user awareness that threat actors\nare constantly evolving their malware and looking for new schemes to execute this malware\non victims’ devices. Our advice to Android users:\n\nInstall applications only from trusted and verified publishers.\nIf you see an application from a new publisher, search for analogs from a trusted one.\nReport to Google any seemingly suspicious applications you encounter.\n\n## Protections\n\n\n-----\n\nCheck Point s [Harmony Mobile Prevents malware from infiltrating mobile devices by](https://www.checkpoint.com/harmony/mobile-security/mobile/)\ndetecting and blocking the download of malicious apps in real-time.
