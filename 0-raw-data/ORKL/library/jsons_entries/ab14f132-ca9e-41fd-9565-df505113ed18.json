This full-blown spying framework consists of two\npackages named ‘Tokyo’ and ‘Yokohama’. It includes backdoors, loaders, orchestrators, C2\ncommunicators, audio recorders, keyloggers, screen and webcam grabbers, documents and\ncryptography key stealers, and even its own file indexer for the victim’s machine. We\ndiscovered up to 80 malicious modules stored in its encrypted Virtual File System, one of the\nhighest numbers of plugins we’ve ever seen for an APT toolset.\n\n\n-----\n\nJust to highlight its capabilities, TajMahal is able to steal data from a CD burnt by a victim as\nwell as from the printer queue. It can also request to steal a particular file from a previously\nseen USB stick; next time the USB is connected to the computer, the file will be stolen.\n\nTajMahal has been developed and used for at least the past five years. The first known ‘legit’\nsample timestamp is from August 2013, and the last one is from April 2018. The first\nconfirmed date when TajMahal samples were seen on a victim’s machine is August 2014.\n\nMore details about TajMahal are available to customers of the Kaspersky Intelligence\n[Reporting service (contact intelreports@kaspersky.com).](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:intelreports@kaspersky.com)\n\n## Technical details\n\nWe have discovered two different types of TajMahal packages, self-named Tokyo and\nYokohama. The targeted systems found by Kaspersky Lab were infected with both\npackages. This suggests that Tokyo was used as first stage infection, deploying the fullyfunctional Yokohama package on interesting victims, and then left in for backup purposes.\nThe packages share the same code base, we identified the following interesting features:\n\nCapable of stealing documents sent to the printer queue.\nData gathered for victim recon includes the backup list for Apple mobile devices.\nTakes screenshots when recording VoiceIP app audio.\nSteals written CD images.\nCapable of stealing files previously seen on removable drives once they are available\nagain.\nSteals Internet Explorer, Netscape Navigator, FireFox and RealNetworks cookies.\nIf deleted from Frontend file or related registry values, it will reappear after reboot with\na new name and startup type.\n\n## Victims\n\nSo far we have detected a single victim based on our telemetry – a diplomatic entity from a\ncountry in Central Asia.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe TajMahal framework is an intriguing discovery that’s of great interest, not least for its\nhigh level of technical sophistication, which is beyond any doubt. The huge amount of\nplugins that implement a number of features is something we have never before seen in any\nother APT activity. For example, it has its own indexer, emergency C2s, is capable of stealing\nspecific files from external drives when they become available again, etc.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe question is, why go to all that trouble for just one victim? A likely hypothesis is that there\nare other victims we haven’t found yet. This theory is reinforced by the fact that we couldn’t\nsee how one of the files in the VFS was used by the malware, opening the door to the\npossibility of additional versions of the malware that have yet to be detected.\n\nKaspersky Lab products detect the TajMahal APT samples as\nHEUR:Trojan.Multi.Chaperone.gen\n\n## Appendix I – Indicators of compromise\n\nA full set of IOCs and Yara rules is available to customers of Kaspersky Intelligence\n[Reporting service – contact intelreports@kaspersky.com](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:intelreports@kaspersky.com)\n\n**Domains and IPs**\n\n104.200.30.125\n\n50.56.240.153\n\nrahasn.webhop.org\n\nrahasn.akamake.net\n\nrahasn.homewealth.biz\n\n**File Hashes**\n\n22d142f11cf2a30ea4953e1fffb0fa7e\n\n2317d65da4639f4246de200650a70753\n\n27612cb03c89158225ca201721ea1aad\n\n412956675fbc3f8c51f438c1abc100eb\n\n490a140093b5870a47edc29f33542fd2\n\n51a7068640af42c3a7c1b94f1c11ab9d\n\n533340c54bd25256873b3dca34d7f74e\n\n684eca6b62d69ce899a3ec3bb04d0a5b\n\n69a19abf5ba56ee07cdd3425b07cf8bf\n\n6cfd131fef548fcd60fbcdb59317df8e\n\n72dc98449b45a7f1ccdef27d51e31e91\n\n7c733607a0932b1b9a9e27cd6ab55fe0\n\n7d5265e814843b24fcb3787768129040\n\n80c37e062aa4c94697f287352acf2e9d\n\n815f1f8a7bc1e6f94cb5c416e381a110\n\na43d3b31575846fa4c3992b4143a06da\n\n08e82dc7bae524884b7dc2134942aadb\n\n7bcd736a2394fc49f3e27b3987cce640\n\n57314359df11ffdf476f809671ec0275\n\nb72737b464e50aa3664321e8e001ff32\n\nce8ce92fb6565181572dce00d69c24f8\n\n5985087678414143d33ffc6e8863b887\n\n\n-----\n\n84730a6e426fbd3cf6b821c59674c8a0\nd5377dc1821c935302c065ad8432c0d2\nd8f1356bebda9e77f480a6a60eab36bb\n92f8e3f0f1f7cc49fad797a62a169acd\n9003cfaac523e94d5479dc6a10575e60\ndf91b86189adb0a11c47ce2405878fa1\ne17bd40f5b5005f4a0c61f9e79a9d8c2\nc1e7850da5604e081b9647b58248d7e8\n99828721ac1a0e32e4582c3f615d6e57\nf559c87b4a14a4be1bd84df6553aaf56\nb9c208ea8115232bfd9ec2c62f32d6b8\n061089d8cb0ca58e660ce2e433a689b3\n0e9afd3a870906ebf34a0b66d8b07435\n9c115e9a81d25f9d88e7aaa4313d9a8f\n520ee02668a1c7b7c262708e12b1ba6b\n7bfba2c69bed6b160261bdbf2b826401\n77a745b07d9c453650dd7f683b02b3ed\n3a771efb7ba2cd0df247ab570e1408b2\n0969b2b399a8d4cd2d751824d0d842b4\nfc53f2cd780cd3a01a4299b8445f8511\n4e39620afca6f60bb30e031ddc5a4330\nbfe3f6a79cad5b9c642bb56f8037c43b\n3dfebce4703f30eed713d795b90538b5\n9793afcea43110610757bd3b800de517\n36db24006e2b492cafb75f2663f241b2\n21feb6aa15e02bb0cddbd544605aabad\n21feb6aa15e02bb0cddbd544605aabad\n649ef1dd4a5411d3afcf108d57ff87af\n320b2f1d9551b5d1df4fb19bd9ab253a\n3d75c72144d873b3c1c4977fbafe9184\nb9cf4301b7b186a75e82a04e87b30fe4\nb4e67706103c3b8ee148394ebee3f268\n7bfbd72441e1f2ed48fbc0f33be00f24\ncdb303f61a47720c7a8c5086e6b2a743\n2a6f7ec77ab6bd4297e7b15ae06e2e61\n8403a28e0bffa9cc085e7b662d0d5412\n3ffd2915d285ad748202469d4a04e1f5\n04078ef95a70a04e95bda06cc7bec3fa\n235d427f94630575a4ea4bff180ecf5d\n8035a8a143765551ca7db4bc5efb5dfd\ncacaa3bf3b2801956318251db5e90f3c\n1aadf739782afcae6d1c3e4d1f315cbd\n\n\n-----\n\nc3e255888211d74cc6e3fb66b69bbffb\nd9e9f22988d43d73d79db6ee178d70a4\n16ab79fb2fd92db0b1f38bedb2f02ed8\n8da15a97eaf69ff7ee184fc446f19cf1\nffc7305cb24c1955f9625e525d58aeee\nc0e72eb4c9f897410c795c1b360090ef\n9ad6fa6fdedb2df8055b3d30bd6f64f1\n44619a88a6cff63523163c6a4cf375dd\na571660c9cf1696a2f4689b2007a12c7\n81229c1e272218eeda14892fa8425883\n0ac48cfa2ff8351365e99c1d26e082ad\n\n## Appendix II – Additional technical details\n\nThe following table provides the full list of files stored in the VFS with a short description\ndescribing what the plugins do:\n\n**nn** **Name** **Short description**\n\n\n00\n\n01\n\n02\n\n03\n\n04\n\n06\n\n07\n\n08\n\n\ncs64.dll\n\ncs32.dll\n\nli64.dll\n\nli32.dll\n\nad64.dll\n\nad32.dll\n\nle64.dll\n\nle32.dll\n\n\nC2 communication and command processing.
