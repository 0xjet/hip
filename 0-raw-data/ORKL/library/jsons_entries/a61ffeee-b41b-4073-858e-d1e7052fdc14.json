In many ways, its operation is very similar to other ransomware, but its\nransomware-as-a-service business model seems to have propelled it forward.\n\n[GandCrab appeared just over a year ago, promoted on public websites but sold exclusively](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/gandcrab-ransomware-distributed-by-exploit-kits-appends-gdcb-extension/)\nthrough the dark web. Independent security researcher David Montenegro was the first to\ncome across it. At that time, it was being distributed by the RIG exploit kit, which was being\nused in a malvertising campaign, leveraging banner ad networks to deliver the malicious\ncode to unsuspecting visitors to public websites.\n\n\n-----\n\nSince then, the ransomware has developed a large pool of customers, and an unfortunately\nlarge pool of victims as well. The authors have kept pace with a team of cryptography\nexperts working for Europol and Bitdefender who have released several decryptor tools, and\ncontinue to release updated versions of the malware that bypasses the decryptor features\nevery time a new decryptor hits the street.\n\nThe ransomware may owe some of its early success to its unique software licensing\nscheme, which the creators called Dashboard Essential and has become widely referred to\nas ransomware-as-a-service. For $100, neophyte ransomware crime lords could build a\ncriminal fiefdom of up to 200 victims in a two month period, working their way up to earning\nenough to afford more premium-rate services and features.\n\nIn essence, the GandCrab creators provide a criminal franchise system.\n\n## How do you get it?\n\nInitially delivered via RIG exploit kit, once licensees began using the ransomware, they\nchose whatever distribution method suited them best. By a month later, malicious spam\nbegan to appear with malicious office documents that, when opened, delivered GandCrab to\nvictims.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware itself uses a deviously clever fileless approach to execute itself, and encrypt\nthe victim’s files. A maldoc spawns PowerShell code that looks like this example:\n\nGandCrab’s PowerShell launch command\nThis instance of PowerShell is pointed at a file hosted on a reputable, public website, such\nas Pastebin, but we’ve also seen them pointed at malicious domains. The file contains .Netbased PowerShell code that calls a module named ‘Invoke-GandCrab’ (naturally), which, by\nthis point, is already loaded in the memory of the victim’s machine.\n\nWhat makes this attack special and unique is its ability to be fileless. To achieve that, the\n[authors leveraged a feature called Reflective PE Injection, made available in a Github code](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/blob/master/CodeExecution/Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection.ps1)\nrepository named PowerSploit, to inject GandCrab’s malicious binary into PowerShell’s\nrunning memory. In Reflective PE Injection, PowerShell is made to load the ransomware\ndirectly from memory, and never writes a copy of its PE to disk. This is an effective\ncountermeasure to traditional antivirus software, which would not be able to detect or clean\nthe (conspicuously absent) malicious file.\n\nMore recent variants of GandCrab have been spreading by means of known vulnerabilities\n(including Fallout Exploit Kit, which only recently appeared in the wild), and the rest of the\n“usual suspects” varieties of Trojans. Like Ryuk and SamSam, some purveyors of GandCrab\nattacks leveraged JBoss, Oracle Fusion and WebLogic, and Tomcat vulnerabilities to spread\nonto enterprise networks. The PowerShell scripts are also encoded, though they perform the\nsame function as before; They just not human-readable. Attack traffic targeting Oracle\nWebLogic on port 7001/tcp is now part of the Internet background radiation. Attackers will\nnever stop actively scanning the internet for this port.\n\n## How does it work?\n\nThe creators of GandCrab release frequent version updates. These notes refer to version\n5.0.5.\n\nThe malware checks for a mutex on start. If it finds it, the program quits. In our case, the\nmutex looked like this:\n\nGandCrab killswitch mutex\nThe malware also halts and does no damage if your computer language settings are\nconfigured to any of these specific language IDs.\n\n\n-----\n\nMy computer moved to San Salvador\n\nThe malware sends a profile of the hardware, OS, and other information back home\n\nSystem\n\nprofile information GandCrab sends to its C2\nGandCrab uses a lot of lists. It kills the process of some programs in order to correctly\nencrypt the data files they might have open. It of course has a target list of filetypes to\nencrypt, and files and paths to whitelist. It deletes the Volume Shadow Copy of the drives,\nand enumerates all mounted drive letters.\n\nThe encryption takes a little time to complete, depending on how full the drive is. Free\ndecryptor tools have been released for some versions of GandCrab, but the authors quickly\nupdate to another version, and the decryptor tools stop working. All the ransom notes include\na GandCrab key you must provide if you meet their demand for payment.\n\nThe GandCrab\n\nkey uniquely identifies you to the ransomware franchisee\n\n\n-----\n\n## How much do you have to pay?\n\nGandCrab ransom note featuring members of Spongebob’s posse\nThe business model for GandCrab gives the franchisee the option of choosing their ransom\namount, among other features. Some victims report ransoms as low as $300 but they can\nrun an order of magnitude higher.\n\nNetwork communication\n\n\n-----\n\nGandCrab tends to communicate with a wide range of what appear to be hacked sites\nrunning WordPress. It transmits data in GET requests to files with image file extensions (jpg,\npng, gif, bmp)\n\n\n-----",
