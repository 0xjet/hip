    "plain_text": "# Taking the bait: The modus operandi of massive social engineering waves impacting banks in Portugal\n\n**seguranca-informatica.pt/taking-the-bait-the-modus-operandi-of-massive-social-engineering-waves-impacting-banks-**\nin-portugal\n\nJanuary 31, 2022\n\n**Taking the bait: The modus operandi of massive social engineering waves impacting**\n**banks in Portugal in the last two years.**\nA massive social engineering campaign has been disseminated at least in the last two years\nin Portugal. The waves have impacted banking organizations with the goal of stealing the\nusers’ secrets, accessing the home banking portals, and also controlling all the operations on\nthe fly via Command and Control (C2) servers geolocated in Brazil.\n\nIn this article, we will understand the modus operandi of this wide campaign, how the\nphishing templates are disseminated, how victims’ are triggered, dig into the details of the\nphishing templates and C2 server source-code, and learn how criminals are orchestrating all\nthe operations.\n\n## Overview\n\nA wide social engineering campaign affecting bank users’ in Portugal, Spain, Brazil, Mexico,\nChile, the UK, and France has been disseminated and operated by Brazilian criminals at\nleast in the last two years. Although users of many countries have been impacted, this article\nwill focus whenever possible only on the Portuguese waves.\n\n**[As documented in the past, a lot of malicious templates have been developed and updated](https://seguranca-informatica.pt/the-evolution-of-phishing-infrastructure-a-large-scale-campaign-called-anubis-that-targets-brazilian-and-portuguese-internet-users/#.YdoJBmjP0Q9)**\nby criminals to lure victims to share their home banking credentials on fake templates. As\nusual, the phishing email templates are incredibly similar to the original emails, with the\nexception of the content provided. Nevertheless, the campaign is not just about collecting\ndata through a landing page: criminals are able to control every step of the infection\n**chain, asking the victim for additional details via C2 servers in real-time. This campaign has**\nbeen observed since 2019 in Portugal and is depicted in Figure 1 below.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 1: High-level diagram of the social engineering infection chain. Victims are triggered_**\n_via phishing, spear-phishing, or smishing waves, and the observed landing pages can have_\n_two distinct forms. Users’ details are collected offline or on the fly orchestration via C2 is_\n_performed by criminals._\n\n## Key findings\n\nCriminals target victims from different countries and collect details from home\nbanking portals and payment cards.\nThe criminals geolocated in Brazil have a list of target phone numbers and emails\nused to trigger victims in spear-phishing campaigns.\nThe criminals can use two different phishkits engines.\nThe compromised data can be accessed by criminals in offline mode by\naccessing the server where the landing page is running. The data is transferred\nvia FTP or web pannels, and further access is performed to the banking portal.\nOn the other side, an orchestration schema in real-time can be used to control\nevery step of the infection chain. With this mechanism in place, the infection\nprocess is as real as possible to the legitimate system. Criminals can\nimpersonate the victims and access the legitimate service in real-time while\ndetails are requested via the fake page.\n\n## Genesis: The initial trigger\n\n The smishing way\n\nEverything starts with smishing (SMS) or spear-phishing campaigns (fake emails). Smishing\nis leveraged through a wordlist of valid and processed phone numbers acquired by criminals\nfrom other criminal groups that sell this type of content – including emails – on underground\nforums and Telegram or Discord channels.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 2: How criminals are obtaining phone numbers and emails to trigger victims’._**\n\nInteresting to notice that these groups are looking for Fully Undetectable (FUD) malware to\ntarget victims. We believe this thread is related to the acquisition of the source code of the\n**[URSA trojan detailed here.](https://seguranca-informatica.pt/threat-analysis-the-emergent-ursa-trojan-impacts-many-countries-using-a-sophisticated-loader/#.YfcW3OrP0Q8)**\n\nThe smishing campaign is started by using SMS API services from third-party companies to\nrelease the trigger.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 3: Smishing campaigns executed by criminals to target victims according to several_**\n_lists grouped by countries._\n\n## The spear-phishing method\n\nThe spear-phishing campaigns are executed in the same way. A list of emails is acquired\nand a well-designed template impersonating the legitimate organizations is sent to the\nvictims’ inbox. Figure 4 below presents some of the templates disseminated in the last weeks\nin Portugal.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 4: Phishing email templates disseminated in Portugal during the last weeks of 2021._**\n\nAs usual, the email body has hardcoded a malicious URL specially crafted by criminals via\nshortURL systems. The following image illustrates some malicious domains created on the\nbit[.]do service by criminals.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 5: Short-URLs created by criminals and used in several campaigns in the wild._**\n\nThese kinds of campaigns fully target a group of users, spear-phishing. For this, criminals\nperform initial triage, before directing the victim to the malicious landing page.\n\nIn detail, a redirector system accessed after clicking on the malicious link sent via email is\nresponsible for validating whether the email passed through a URL parameter is contained in\na pre-computed list, which demonstrates that phishing campaigns are totally targeted to a\ngroup of users.\n\nThis redirector is composed of the following URL path: malicious_domain/redir or\n**_malicious_domain/?cliente=xxx._**\n\nAs observed below, the redirector system includes some features, namely:\n\n**A list of blocked domains**\n**A blacklist of IP addresses; and**\n**A logging mechanism to keep the victims’ details (date and hour, OS**\n**version, email, IP address, and web-browser details.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 6: Black-list mechanisms and logging procedure available on the redirector system._**\n\nFigure 6 shows that requests from IP ranges and CIDR /32 IP addresses are blocked and\nthe same procedure is also applied to domains and email addresses.\n\nDigging into de details, the files “xadm.php” e “xblock.php” allow a web interaction to\nfacilitate the block of IP addresses and email addresses. The local database is comprised of\n2 TXT files (“xblock-ip.txt” and “xblock-mail.txt”). On the other hand, the log of operations\nand victims’ accesses are kept in the files “xerror.txt” and “xreg.txt“.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 7: File tree of the phishing redirector._**\n\nThe used authentication mechanism is straightforward. The files are protected by a\nhardcoded password, and the entire procedure is carried out with the TXT files (the\ndatabase), as mentioned before. Some details about the redirector source code are below.\n\n**_Figure 8: Details about the authentication mechanism and TXT files that support all the_**\n_redirector operations._\n\nAmong other highlights, the index.php file is responsible for some additional checks in order\nto “redirect” the victim to the final landing page.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 9: Initial validation when a victim request (HTTP-request) is received._**\n\nNext, some extra validations are performed in order to circumvent automatic requests from\ncyber security systems, Internet bots, security experts, and so on. As highlighted below, the\nvictim is then redirected to the final landing page available on another web server if the initial\nrequest matches all the steps with success.\n\n**_Figure 10: Extra validations executed by the phishing redirector system – a triage process to_**\n_evade automatic requests and Internet bots, security systems, etc._\n\n## Phishkits: How landing pages operate\n\n\n-----\n\nIn general, we are scrutinizing two different phishkits in this article, namely:\n\n**A simple landing page (without C2) with the goal of only collecting**\n**credentials to access the home banking portal and other details such as**\n**SMS tokens and bank codes; and**\n**A landing page orchestrated via local C2 panel and also another huge**\n**schema with central C2 servers geolocated in Brazil.**\n\n## Simplest way: a single landing page without a C2 mechanism\n\nThis type of architecture typically uses TXT files to store the victims’ data in raw format.\nCriminals further access servers and download details via FTP or web pannels. The landing\npages are also equipped with a notification mechanism, where the feed with the victims’ data\nis sent to a Telegram channel or even via email by using the SMTP protocol.\n\nSome of the landing pages observed in Portugal within this context are presented below.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 11: Example of landing pages observed in Portugal during the last weeks of 2021._**\n\nIn order to control and check the number of infections, these phishkits have embedded a\nvictims’ log feature as demonstrated below. In this sense, criminals are able to control how\nmany victims were infected and decide when the right moment to collect and download the\ndata. In some cases, the access is performed via VPN services, otherwise, from residential\nBrazilian IP addresses.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 12: 898 victims’ (accesses) were targeted in this phishkit – many of them valid_**\n_accesses, and with legitimate information stored on the server and collected by criminals._\n\nIt’s interesting to notice the criminals do not delete the 1st infection from the logging file,\nevery time with their residential IP address. Due to the lack observed, it’s straightforward to\ntrack the groups behind these kinds of schemas based on their geolocation (to let the cat out\nof the bag).\n\nAs previously mentioned, the collected data is stored inside TXT files and images with bank\ncodes also uploaded into specific folders (left-side), and the detail can also be sent simply\nvia email with the banking code images as attachments (right-side).\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 13: Example of how the victims’ details are stored on the webserver or simply sent to_**\n_the criminals’ email inboxes via SMTP protocol._\n\n## Orchestration on the fly\n\n\n-----\n\nIn this section, 5 different phishkits of orchestrator systems are presented. All of them\noperate more or less within the same model:\n\n**The victim accesses the landing page; and**\n**Criminals control all the steps by using a C2 panel available on the same**\n**webserver or a C2 server geolocated in Brazil.**\n\nRegarding this orchestration C2s, criminals are able to request details step-by-step in realtime, as illustrated below.\n\n### #Phishkit 1\n\n**_Figure 14: Phishkit with a C2 panel available on the same server. All the data is requested_**\n_step by step by operators._\n\nAs seen, on the same server where the phishing page is hosted, a C2 panel is included. This\npanel allows step-by-step control of the data requested from victims. In the image above, the\ndashboard and a window where the request for 3 banking card values (secret code) is made.\nThe victims’ details are stored on the server by using a MySQL database, usually configured\nvia the Cpanel Host Manager system.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 15: #phishkit 1 source-code details._**\n\n### #Phishkit 2\n\nThis scenario presents a similar process as described previously. A C2 panel available in the\nsame server is used to control the flow on the fly by operators.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 16: #phishkit 2 landing page and C2 panel._**\n\nMalicious operators can choose what type of data they want to request, and the information\nis stored on a MySQL database, just like on #phiskit 1.\n\n### #Phishkit 3\n\nIn this phishkit, the same modus operandi is used. The data is requested in a C2 panel on\nthe server, but this time the details are stored in TXT.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 17: #phishkit 3 – landing page and C2 panel._**\n\nInstead of using a DBMS, this particular phishikit manages everything with TXT files. The\nPHP files are responsible for creating, editing, or even deleting information from the TXT files\n(the database of the malicious schema).\n\n**_Figure 18: TXT files that stored the victims’ data in raw format. The files are accessed (and_**\n_edited) from the PHP pages of the C2 panel._\n\nAs expected, criminals must access the webserver to download all the details.\n\n### #Phishkit 4\n\nThis phishkit is built differently from the previous ones. Rather than using a panel to request\ndata in stages, it only collects the access credentials and makes automated requests to\nvalidate the credentials in real-time. In addition, the phishkit extracts information from the\nlegitimate servers/portals in order to populate the malicious database, including the victim’s\nname, credit card (number, date, and CVV number), account balance, etc.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 19: #phishkit 4 – landing page, C2 panel, and API details used probably to feed a C2_**\n_server in the background._\n\nThis phiskit uses an API that exposes the information to be collected by a C2 in the\nbackground. Next, criminals can use them to perform other tasks.\n\n### #Phishkit 5\n\nThe #phiskit 5 has been used at least for the last 2 years in Portugal. The landing pages are\nlaunched on newly registered domains, either on the same day the campaign is\ndisseminated or during the night to avoid their detection. The landing pages all communicate\nwith C2 servers geolocated in Brazil and controlled on the fly by criminals.\n\nFigure 20 shows some of the landing pages used by criminals.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 20: Landing pages used by criminals – #phishkit 5._**\n\nThese C2 servers have ben use used in different types of campaigns around the globe,\nmainly to execute and control:\n\n**phishing campaigns via landing pages**\n**infections via conventional banking malware (Windows OS); and**\n**infections via malicious APK (Android banking trojan).**\n\nAs observed below, the C2 operators can request data step-by-step via a tailored way.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 21: #phishkit 5- one of the C2 servers geolocated in Brazil._**\n\nNotice that the “ANUBIS” operator was highlighted because the same user appeared in a\nvery similar campaign – ANUBIS NETWORK – THE EVOLUTION OF THE PHISHING\n**SCHEMA. This can be a clear sign that the same group is operating these C2 servers as**\nwell.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 22: Similarities of the #phishkit 5 operators vs Anubis operators._**\n\nMore details about the Anubis phishing infrastructure analysis are below.\n\nReturning to this analysis, another C2 server also operated by the same group and using the\nsame modus operandi – but with a slightly different design – was observed operating only in\nLatin America. Some screens are presented below.\n\n**_Figure 23: C2 server operated by the same group only in Latin American countries._**\n\nAs mentioned above, The C2 server under analysis is also used to control infections via\nmalicious APK. The following screen is a clear indicator of that.\n\n\n-----\n\nBPI_Security.apk :\na55a9e204ca0f1015a34f76967ab1e93d7e6ff4ab5abb4816b7438c8db41c8e7\nFrom: https://sis-ptcadastro[.]com/app/BPI_Security.apk\n[Seems targeting Portugal @banco_bpi‘s customers.](https://twitter.com/banco_bpi?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\nC2 panel is named “Operador MIB 1.0” – it has BR connections.\ncc [@LukasStefanko](https://twitter.com/LukasStefanko?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [@virqdroid](https://twitter.com/virqdroid?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [pic.twitter.com/vuV5rqinX0](https://t.co/vuV5rqinX0)\n\n[— MalwareHunterTeam (@malwrhunterteam) April 15, 2020](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam/status/1250386648598228992?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n**_Figure 24: C2 server used to control malware infections via malicious Android package_**\n_(APK)._\n\nMore details about malicious APK files operated by this group are below.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe infection process using these C2 servers can be observed in the video provided below,\nwhich exemplifies how the information is requested step-by-step by the operators.\n\n[Another video referring to another campaign can also be viewed here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqyuAj9hvy4)\n\nThe C2 servers have a MySQL database used to keep and control all the operations, and\nseveral replicas are available on different servers geolocated in Brazil.\n\n**_Figure 25: #Phishkit 5 – MySQL databases and some of the available tables with target_**\n_companies._\n\nIn detail, C2 was developed based on a well-structured pillar, where minimal information is\nsent to landing pages during the infection process. Figure 26 below presents the #phishkit 5\nfile tree (source-code).\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 26: #phishkit 5: file tree._**\n\nAs observed, this C2 server is capable of spawning new domains based on available apache\n_.config files. The process is completely automated, allowing criminals not to waste too much_\ntime setting up new domains.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 27: C2 server and its spawning mechanism to set up new phishing domains._**\n\nBelow is presented the complete list of configuration files available in one of the C2 servers\nalong with the targeted organizations:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n2854app.com.conf\n

Phishing scams in particular\nhave increased in volume and sophistication in recent years, making early detection hard.\n\nThere are several groups utilizing this type of scheme and obtaining email lists, malware,\nand FUD codes from underground forums, that are mainly paid via cryptocurrencies (Monero\nand Bitcoin). Many groups operate both phishing and malware campaigns at the same time,\n\n\n-----\n\ne.g. trojan URSA seems to be also operated by the same group of the C2 server\n**analyzed above.**\n\nIn this sense, monitoring these types of IoCs is a crucial point now, as it is expected that in\nthe coming weeks or months new infections or waves can appear.\n\nFrom the Internet end users’ point of view, it’s important to equip them with strategies to fight\nthis emerging threat and provide train in general. For instance, every time we receive an\nemail from the bank, we need to question ourselves:\n\nCan the bank ask for my secrets by email? (it’s a trap)\nAm I in debt or do I have to pay something to the bank? (it’s a trap) … just\nconfirm the situation, call by phone.\nLet me check the FROM address … seems weird (it’s a trap)\nIf I click on the URL inside the email, first I need to check out the domain …\nprobably it will not be the official one 😉 (it’s a trap again)\nLet me check if the certification authority is the same as the official home banking\nplatform. You will see: a trap again.\n\nLast but not least, if you have doubts or find any suspicious URLs, emails, or junk, just drop\n**us a line here, we’ll be happy to help and take a cup of coffee.**\n\n[Phishing and malware URLs can also be submitted into 0xSI_f33d, a Virus Total official](https://feed.seguranca-informatica.pt/)\ningestor.\n\n### Thank you to all who have contributed 😉\n\n[Pedro Tavares](https://seguranca-informatica.pt/author/pipocaz/)\n**[Pedro Tavares is a professional in the field of information security working as an Ethical](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sirpedrotavares/)**\nHacker/Pentester, Malware Researcher and also a Security Evangelist.
