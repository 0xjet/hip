Two new malware families are\n\nused in this campaign that we name UP007 and SLServer.\n\nThe UP007 malware family was previously observed by Arbor Security Emergency Response Team (ASERT) in the report\n\n[“Uncovering the Seven Pointed Dagger,” which analyzes a set of samples that were hosted on the national level electoral](http://www.arbornetworks.com/blog/asert/uncovering-the-seven-pointed-dagger/)\n\ncommission of Myanmar (Burma): the Myanmar Union Election Commission. One of the samples analyzed was described as\n\n[“unknown malware”, which we call UP007 based on an identifier in the malware’s network traffic. In a report released today, ASERT](https://www.arbornetworks.com/blog/asert/four-element-sword-engagement)\n\ndescribes a series of campaigns targeting Tibetan, Hong Kong, and Taiwanese interests, which also includes details on the same\n\nUP007 sample we analyze.\n\n[A recent PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) report includes analysis of the SLServer sample we analyze (PwC refers to the family as](http://pwc.blogs.com/cyber_security_updates/2016/03/taiwant-election-targetting.html)\n\nSunOrcal). We refer to the malware as SLServer due to a resource dialog in the file. These previous reports collected samples from\n\n[VirusTotal. We received the original email lure and samples used in the campaign from a targeted source, and found that both](https://www.virustotal.com/)\n\nUP007 and SLServer were sent to targets in the same attack.\n\nThis research note builds on previous reporting by more closely examining UP007 and SLServer, variations of these samples found\n\n“in the wild”, and the connections between these attacks and other campaigns. Previous reports have shown overlap in the tactics,\n\ntechniques, and procedures used in this campaign in other operations targeting groups in Burma, Hong Kong, and the Tibetan\n\ncommunity. We speculate that either a single threat actor is targeting these groups or some level of formal or informal resource\n\nsharing is occurring between the operators behind the campaigns.\n\n# Espionage Campaign Targeting Hong Kong Activists\n\nIn the week prior to the January 2016 Taiwanese General Election, Hong Kong­based pro­democracy activists received a targeted\n\nemail purporting to come from a Taiwanese non­profit organization with information about the upcoming election. The email\n\n[included a Google Drive link to a RAR archive file: “2016總統選舉民情中心預測值.rar”, which translates to “Predictive Forecast](http://www.rarlab.com/)\n\nfrom Centre of Public Sentiment in 2016 Presidential Elections.rar”.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1: Targeting email sent to Hong Kong democracy activists_\n\n\n**Translated Email Text:**\nTo recipients: Jinshen Tu, Zhifeng Huang, and Xiuxian Zhang. The 2016 general election enters its crucial final 10 days, and 73 electoral\ndistricts conclude their voting (1041229); Centre of Public Sentiment’s predicted forecast in the 2016 presidential elections (104.12.28).\n\nThe 2016 Election enters its crucial final 10 days. On the 6th, Ing­wen Tsai, the DPP (Democratic Progressive Party) candidate, called on\nDPP supporters to consolidate their votes. She warned that the intense internal competition within the DPP had caused people to be\nworried about a splitting of the votes, potentially leading to the loss of the 15th and 16th seats.\n\nThe election day is on the 16th. Besides the presidential election, there is also the legislative election which includes district seats and\nnon­district seats. There are 34 non­district seats in total, of which the DPP won 13 during the last election. Given the higher degree of\nsupport this time, the DPP should be able to secure 16 seats. But as the New Power Party’s (NPP) influence and support grows, it might\nthreaten the DPP.\n\nIn order to promote support for non­district legislators, the DPP Central Standing Committee organized a campaign event this afternoon.\nThe chairwoman of the DPP, Ing­wen Tsai, said there are only ten days left before the election, and the three things she worried the most\nabout were: 1) ballot bribery, which may cause DPP’s loss in certain swing areas; 2) whether young people would return home to vote on\nJan 16th; 3) vote splitting that may lead good candidates to lose in non­district legislative elections.\n\nPredictive Forecast from Centre of Public Sentiment in the 2016 Presidential Elections.rar\n\n\n# Delivery Mechanism\n\nWe have observed the use of Google Drive links as a delivery vector in recent campaigns targeting Tibetan organizations. In these\n\n[campaigns, Google Drive links were used to send malware and phishing pages. We have also seen the tactic used in recent](https://citizenlab.org/2015/06/targeted-attacks-against-tibetan-and-hong-kong-groups-exploiting-cve-2014-4114/)\n\n[espionage campaigns targeting an NGO working on environmental issues in Southeast Asia. The prior use of Google Drive as a](https://citizenlab.org/2015/10/targeted-attacks-ngo-burma/)\n\ndelivery vector against Tibetan groups is significant, as Tibetan groups are promoting Google Drive as an alternative to sending file\n\nattachments to prevent infection from document­based malware.\n\n# Examining the RAR Archive\n\nWithin the linked RAR archive, the top three directories contain a mix of malicious and benign documents, as well as shortcuts that\n\nrun two executables that are deeply nested within hidden directories in the archive. The file structure of this archive is shown in\n\nFigure 2.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe top level directory of this archive contains a benign Word document named 聲明.doc, which translates to “Statement.doc”.\n\nThe text of this document is written in Chinese and is related to the Taiwanese election.\n\n\n**Document Text:**\n73個立委選區選情研判(1041229),\n2016總統選舉民情中心預測值(104.12.28).\n文件內容僅代表個人立場，僅供參閱。解壓選舉民情中心預測值到桌面即可查閱全部數據.\n\n**English Translation:**\nElection polling of 73 legislative electoral districts（12/29/104).\nPredicted forecast from Centre of Public Sentiment in the 2016 presidential elections (12/28/104).\nAll the documents represent personal views and are for reference only. Unzip Election Polling Centre’s forecast to the desktop to view all\ndata.\n\n\nThe first two directories contain separate Windows shortcuts, each of which runs an executable that is nested down in seven hidden\n\nsubdirectories. Table 1 shows details of the two executables contained in this nested directory along with their detection rate by\n\nantivirus vendors according to VirusTotal.\n\n**Filename** **Sample MD5** **AV Detection Rate**\n\nfzyy.exe [d579d7a42ff140952da57264614c37bc](https://virustotal.com/en/file/5b875ecf0b7f67a4429aeaa841eddf8e6b58771e16dbdb43ad6918aa7a5b582d/analysis/) Date / Time: 01­11­2016\n\nDetection Rate: 8/55\n\n[wzget.exe d8becbd6f188e3fb2c4d23a2d36d137b](https://virustotal.com/en/file/ddc05b9f39f579f64742980980ca9820b83a243889bbc5baa37f5c2c1c4beb30/analysis/) Date / Time: 03­21­2016\n\nDetection Rate: 30/57\n\n_Table 1: Sample overview_\n\nThese samples, when executed, create two separate infection chains. The lack of emphasis on tricking targets into running a single\n\nmalicious file is interesting. We are unsure as to why the operators chose to deploy two separate infection chains within the same\n\ndelivery mechanism. It is also unclear why the benign document was included at the top directory, as this would require more user\n\ninteraction for a compromise to be successful. It is possible that this mixture of benign and malicious files is intended to lull the\n\ntargets into a false sense of security.\n\nWithin the archive there are two Microsoft Word files: 2016總統選舉民情中心預測值.doc (translation: “Predictive forecast from\n\nCentre of Public Sentiment in 2016 Presidential Elections”) and 73個立委選區選情研判.doc (translation: “Election polling of 73\n\nlegislative electoral districts”). Despite having different filenames, they are the same file (MD5 hash:\n\n[09ddd70517cb48a46d9f93644b29c72f). This infected document was analyzed in the recent PwC report and the malware family](http://pwc.blogs.com/cyber_security_updates/2016/03/taiwant-election-targetting.html)\n\nwas named SunOrcal by the researchers. In this report we take a closer look at the two nested executables: fzyy.exe and\n\nwzget.exe and the two separate infection chains they produce.\n\n# UP007 Malware Family\n\nThe fzyy.exe executable is a dropper responsible for creating multiple files and starting this particular infection chain. When the\n\nfile is run it creates the following files in the directory: %APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\\\n\n**Filename** **MD5** **Purpose**\n\nconhost.exe f70b295c6a5121b918682310ce0c2165 Loads SBieDll.dll\n\nSBieDll.dll f80edbb0fcfe7cec17592f61a06e4df2 Loads maindll.dll\n\nmaindll.dll d8ede9e6c3a1a30398b0b98130ee3b38 Loads dll2.xor\n\n|Filename|Sample MD5|AV Detection Rate|\n|---|---|---|\n|fzyy.exe|d579d7a42ff140952da57264614c37bc|Date / Time: 01­11­2016 Detection Rate: 8/55|\n|wzget.exe|d8becbd6f188e3fb2c4d23a2d36d137b|Date / Time: 03­21­2016 Detection Rate: 30/57|\n\n|Filename|MD5|Purpose|\n|---|---|---|\n|conhost.exe|f70b295c6a5121b918682310ce0c2165|Loads SBieDll.dll|\n|SBieDll.dll|f80edbb0fcfe7cec17592f61a06e4df2|Loads maindll.dll|\n\n\n-----\n\nrunas.exe 6a541de84074a2c4ff99eb43252d9030 Establishes persistence; Not utilized in this loading chain\n\nnvsvc.exe e0eb981ad6be0bd16246d5d442028687 Unknown – possibly older component\n\n_Table 2: Executable infection chain for fzyy.exe_\n\nThese files are all initially stored as resources within fzyy.exe. Some of the files are stored in encoded form while maindll.dll\n\nis stored as a packed executable. When writing the files to disk, the dropper will decode and write the files stored in encoded form.\n\nIn addition the infection chain will check multiple registry keys before writing maindll.dll.\n\n[The keys largely seem to check for the presence of popular Chinese antivirus products: 360 Security, Kingsoft Antivirus, Rising AV,](https://www.360totalsecurity.com/en/)\n\n[Jiangmin, and Micropoint as well as a popular free antivirus product Avira. Interestingly, in this instance, even if the registry keys are](http://jiangmin-antivirus.en.softonic.com/)\n\npresent, maindll.dll will still be written and the infection chain will still continue. The registry keys that are checked by the infection\n\nchain are summarized in Table 3.\n\n**Key** **Subkey**\n\nHKLM\\SOFTWARE\\360Safe\\Liveup curl\n\nHKCU\\Software\\360safe DefaultSkin\n\nHKLM\\SOFTWARE\\kingsoft\\Antivirus WorkPath\n\nHKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Avira\\Avira Destop Path\n\nHKLM\\SOFTWARE\\rising\\RAV installpath\n\nHKLM\\SOFTWARE\\JiangMin InstallPath\n\nHKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Micropoint\\Anti-Attack MP100000\n\n_Table 3: Registry keys that fzyy.exe checks for before writing maindll.dll_\n\nOnce all the files are created, conhost.exe starts, loads SBieDll.dll, then ultimately loads maindll.dll and the final\n\npayload, which we have named UP007 (dll2.xor) due to an identifier in the network traffic. The primary function of UP007\n\nappears to be to log keystrokes to the %USERPROFILE%\\Local Settings\\Temp\\keylog\\ directory and send them to a remote\n\nserver.\n\n[UP007 uses Windows Sockets to communicate with its command and control server (C2). While doing so, it sends a hardcoded](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms738545%28v=vs.85%29.aspx)\n\nHTTP header disguised as Microsoft Update traffic. This is likely an attempt to escape notice by casual inspection of network traffic.\n\nOn connection, UP007 downloads another payload directly from the C2 server. This secondary payload we have named\n\n“DownLoad” given the way it identifies itself in the traffic with the C2 server. This secondary payload is injected into memory. The\n\ninitial network traffic observed from the UP007 sample is seen in Figure 3.\n\n|nvsvc.exe|e0eb981ad6be0bd16246d5d442028687|Unknown – possibly older component|\n|---|---|---|\n\n|Key|Subkey|\n|---|---|\n|HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\360Safe\\Liveup|curl|\n|HKCU\\Software\\360safe|DefaultSkin|\n|HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\kingsoft\\Antivirus|WorkPath|\n|HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Avira\\Avira Destop|Path|\n|HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\rising\\RAV|installpath|\n|HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\JiangMin|InstallPath|\n|HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Micropoint\\Anti-Attack|MP100000|\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3: Network capture of the initial communication by UP007._\n\nOnce the entire payload is received from the C2 server, UP007 sends basic system information such as operating system version,\n\nIP address, and username and the C2 responds with a “READY” announcement (see Figure 4).\n\n_Figure 4: Network capture of the infected system sending system information to the C2._\n\nThe secondary payload (DownLoad) initiates its own separate TCP connection with the C2 server. A sample of the network traffic of\n\nthis secondary payload is seen in Figure 5.\n\n_Figure 5: Network capture of DownLoad connection to the C2._\n\nUnfortunately, even though the connection with the C2 was established, we did not observe any further activity from this payload.\n\nHowever, DownLoad’s strings show references to the following:\n\n\n-----\n\nthis is Desktop\n\n\nIt is possible these are in reference to additional components or capabilities of the malware. Further analysis is required to\n\ndetermine the function of these components.\n\n# UP007 Command and Control Infrastructure\n\nThe command and control server for the UP007 sample is hosted on Hong Kong provider New World Telecom at the IP address\n\n[59.188.12[.]123. Passive DNS data from PassiveTotal indicates that the domain name yeaton.xicp[.]net pointed to this IP](https://www.passivetotal.org/)\n\n[from January 8 2016 to March 19 2016.

The focus of the report was on the\n\ndiscovery of the new Trochilus RAT. However, one of the RAR files was noted as unknown malware. This sample (Security\nPatch-Update.exe, MD5: 82896b68314d108141728a4112618304) is also UP007, signed with the 5D 11 78 4F B8 17 65\n\n02 3F 89 A4 F4 24 3F E1 A9 certificate and configured to communicate with 59.188.12[.]123 directly over port 8008,\n\nidentical to fzyy.exe mentioned above. In this instance, if any of the previously discussed registry keys were present, the sample\n\nwill execute the dropped runas.exe binary. Given this execution, nvsvc.exe is likely also an older component. As discussed\n\nabove the UP007 sample we analyzed shares the same C2 (computer.security-centers[.]com) as the Trochilus RAT\n\n[sample reported by ASERT.](http://www.arbornetworks.com/blog/asert/uncovering-the-seven-pointed-dagger/)\n\n[In November 2015, Palo Alto Networks reported on a newly discovered trojan referred to as Bookworm. They revealed a campaign](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2015/11/attack-campaign-on-the-government-of-thailand-delivers-bookworm-trojan/)\n\nfocused on the targeting of government entities in Thailand. The campaign used a malware family known as FFRAT, and the\n\nsample described in the report connected to the domain hkemail.f3322[.]org for command and control. In August 2015, the\n\nsame domain was reportedly used to host an instance of UP007 as well.\n\n[Finally, the relationship between the SLServer C2 www.olinaodi[.]com and our previous research into the Surtr malware family was](https://citizenlab.org/2013/08/surtr-malware-family-targeting-the-tibetan-community/)\n\n[highlighted by PwC through the overlap in the toucan6712@163[.]com registrant. We tracked malware campaigns using the](https://targetedthreats.net/)\n\nSurtr family that have targeted Tibetan organizations since 2013.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThis latest espionage campaign against Hong Kong activists appears to be connected to a broader set of targets, and operations.\n\n[The recent detailed reporting by ASERT makes it clear that the UP007 malware family has been found in previous campaigns](https://www.arbornetworks.com/blog/asert/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ASERT-Threat-Intelligence-Brief-2015-08-Uncovering-the-Seven-Pointed-Dagger.pdf)\n\ntargeting Burmese interests. In addition, the campaigns share some C2 infrastructure with previous operations against targets in\n\nThailand and the Tibetan community. The domain registration connections between SLServer infrastructure and Surtr infrastructure\n\nalso suggests some level of potential coordination between campaigns targeting Hong Kong groups and the Tibetan community.\n\nDespite these connections, it is unclear if these campaigns are being conducted by the same threat actor.\n\nWe cannot exclude the possibility that distinct operators have a degree of sharing of tools and infrastructure. Alternatively, security\n\n[researcher Ned Moran has articulated a concept of a “digital quartermaster,” to refer to an actor that supplies threat infrastructure](https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/global/en/current-threats/pdfs/rpt-malware-supply-chain.pdf)\n\nand malware development resources to multiple groups. While these scenarios are plausible, we do not have enough data to\n\nproperly assess these competing hypotheses, or to make conclusive statements about the identity of the threat actors.\n\nWhat is clear from our analysis is that civil society groups across Asia continue to be targeted by persistent and organized cyber\n\nespionage campaigns. Civil society often lack the resources and awareness to defend against these operations and closer attention\n\nto the threats they face is needed.\n\n# Acknowledgements\n\n[Special thanks to Valkyrie­X Security Research Group and ASERT.
