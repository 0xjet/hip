Execution flow**\n\n##### Downloader\nMost of the initial downloaders we analyzed have icon and Version Info similar to legitimate applications. For\nexample, in the screenshot below (Fig 3.), we can see that dropper.exe (renamed by us) mimics an NVIDIA process.\nThe dropper also has a revoked digital signature unrelated to NVIDIA, indicating that it was either cryptographically\ninsecure or abused by malware. Around half of the droppers we analyzed seemed to be Delphi executables, but Delphi\ndisassemblers do not recognize them as valid files. Around their entry point, they contained native C/C++ code,\nstructured similarly to the other half of the samples analyzed.\n\n\n-----\n\nDebugging MosaicLoader, One Step at a Time\n\n**Fig.2. Revoked digital signature**\n\n**Fig.3. Version Info similar to NVIDIA**\n\nThe samples share a common trait: they have one or two additional executable sections, named with a combination\nof random English words concatenated to 8 characters (the maximum limit in the PE format). In this section the\nentropy is very high, similar to packed data. However, the content is not packed, it contains code, and it is the result of\nthe mosaic-like obfuscation, which we discuss later in this article.\n\n**Fig.4. Sections of a downloader**\n\n\n-----\n\nDebugging MosaicLoader, One Step at a Time\n\nThe dropper downloads update-assets.zip from the C2 server (checkblanco[.]xyz in our run) into the %TEMP% folder.\nThe .zip file contains the two files required for the second stage, appsetup.exe, and prun.exe. Then, the dropper extracts\nthese files to C:\\Program Files (x86)\\PublicGaming\\ and launches several instances of Powershell to add exclusions\nfrom Windows Defender for the folder and the specific file names.\n\n**Fig.5. Download operation**\n\n**Fig.6. Windows Defender exclusions via Powershell**\n\n##### Second Stage - appsetup.exe\nThe filename for this process is always appsetup.exe in case of an infection. The objective of this process is to attain\npersistence on the system. First, it adds a new registry value to HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\\n_Run\\Prun that will point to the other component of the second stage, C:\\Program Files (x86)\\PublicGaming\\prun.exe._\n\nThen, it registers appsetup.exe as a service called pubgame-updater to run periodically, ensuring that even if the\npersistence registry key gets cleaned up, it adds it again.\n\n**Fig.7. Setting persistence through Run key for prun.exe**\n\n**Fig.8. Creating the service with appsetup.exe**\n\nFinally, it launches prun.exe, which will complete the delivery part of the second stage.\n\n##### Second Stage - prun.exe\nWe can observe the same characteristics for prun.exe as for the downloader. We have an additional section with\nEXECUTE permissions, and it seems to be a big blob of packed data. This is a recurring pattern, so we decided to\nreverse-engineer the file. Around the entry point, there is a function call that transfers the execution from the main\ncode section to the additional one.\n\n\n-----\n\nDebugging MosaicLoader, One Step at a Time\n\n**Fig.9. Jumping from CODE section to “Lagoonw”**\n\nAs we mentioned before, in this section we find heavily obfuscated code. Its Shannon entropy is high, similar to\npacked or encrypted buffers. IDA disassembler considers it an array of DWORDs with no meaningful data. However,\nwhen we jump to the address referenced by the code, we start to observe several obfuscation and anti-reverse\ntechniques.\n\n**Fig.10. The contents of “Lagoonw”, recognized as an array of DWORDs**\n\nThe most prevalent technique is the presence of jumps that break the code into small chunks. Some of these jumps\nare conditional, but the code above them makes sure the conditions are always satisfied.\n\n**Fig.11. The al register is always 0xFF at the time of comparison, the jump is taken**\n\nThe second technique that stands out is the use of mathematical operations with large numbers to obtain values\nrequired by the program. This technique makes code hard to follow while reverse-engineering, and it makes the\nsection seem to contain only data (opcodes being 1-2 bytes followed by large numbers of 4 bytes). Between the code\nchunks are random filler bytes too. These bytes help maintain the impression that the section contains data. The\ncode flow jumps over these parts and only execute the small, meaningful chunks.\n\n\n-----\n\nDebugging MosaicLoader, One Step at a Time\n\n**Fig.12. Obfuscated code flow jumping over filler bytes**\n\nThe three techniques mentioned above let the malware mix up the order of the chunks. This way, it creates a mosaiclike structure where the code of the functions is not contiguous and pieces of different functionalities are intertwined.\nIn the example below, the four chunks of code that follow each other represent different functions. The red arrow\npoints to a function dispatcher, where the malware completed the parameters for a GetProcAddress call to obtain\n_VirtualAlloc, the green one points to some filler operations, the blue one points to a leave section of an SEH handler,_\nand the yellow one points to a trampoline that jumps to a different address. Even if we untangle the jumps, we can’t\nobtain individual functions, as in some cases, the malware omits the use of call instructions, jumping directly to the\ndesired address. The code made up of small intertwined pieces inspired us to call this malware MosaicLoader.\n\n**Fig.13. Intertwined code pieces, like a mosaic, each color points to a piece of code belonging to different functions**\n\nAfter we identified the main obfuscation methods the malware uses, we decided to debug it, as static analysis would\nyield no helpful results. By doing that, we noticed that the malware also employs some classic anti-debugging tricks.\nFor example, it keeps the CPU (and the reverse-engineer) busy without accessing any other resources on the system\nrepeatedly throughout its execution. It stores a random number on the stack, performs lots of filler operations by\nwhich it does not change the execution flow, and decreases the value until the zero flag sets to 1. Next, the malware\nprepares an address in the EBX register depending on the state of the Zero Flag. If the operation did not set the Zero\nFlag to 1, then EBX will refer to the start of the loop, and if the value on the stack got to 0, the address will point to the\nnext piece of code. Finally, it jumps to the address in EBX.\n\n\n-----\n\nDebugging MosaicLoader, One Step at a Time\n\n**Fig.14. Decrease the value on the stack and check zero flag**\n\n**Fig.15. Prepare address in EBX, among garbage operations**\n\n**Fig.16. Jump to the address stored in EBX**\n\nAnother anti-debugging trick that might discourage some reverse-engineers is spamming lots of exceptions that trap\nthe execution to the debugger. The malware does the action repeatedly by iterating over the whole image in 0x10000\nincrements, accessing these memory locations. For pages that are not accessible, reading them will result in an\naccess violation, which pauses execution in the debugger. If we check the SEH chain, we find the malware added an\nexception handling routine, which skips the access violation and continues the execution. There is no other reason for\nthe malware to iterate through the image several times as it searches for loaded modules differently.\n\n**Fig.17. Lots of exceptions for anti-debugging**\n\n\n-----\n\nDebugging MosaicLoader, One Step at a Time\n\nNext, the process iterates the Loaded Module List from the PEB to find kernel32.dll loaded in memory. Then it uses\nthe obtained handle to find the GetProcAddress function. With the resulting address, the malware can resolve its\ndependencies.\n\n**Fig.18. Resolving VirtualAlloc**\n\nThe malware allocates a new memory zone, then uses RtlDecompressBuffer to obtain a piece of executable code and\nmoves the execution there. The first action in this code is to relocate some well-defined addresses by calculating\nthe relative position to the current EIP in variables stored on the stack. Then, it calls RtlDecompressBuffer again for\nanother packed buffer to obtain a new MZPE in memory.\n\n**Fig.19. Addresses observable on stack, used for relocating decompressed code**\n\nThe final step in this process is to transfer execution to this decompressed MZPE. The malware uses the Process\nHollowing technique to inject the code into a newly created process. The difference between the classic hollowing\nand the malware’s approach is that the process is not in a suspended state after creation.\n\nFirst, the malware calls CreateProcess on its path, seemingly launching itself unsuspended. Then it calls\n_NtSuspendThread on the only thread of the new process that is still in the phase of decrementing the large number and_\ndid not execute anything significant. It then overwrites the image of the suspended process with the decompressed\nMZPE. Finally, it uses SetThreadContext to set the instruction pointer to the entry point and resumes the thread.\n\nDecompressing an MZPE and hollowing a process that seems to be a self-launch is a technique also used by\nWarzone RAT [3]. However, Warzone RAT has a specific communication protocol and C2 domains [2] different from\nwhat this malware uses.\n\n**Fig.20. Process creation**\n\n**Fig.21. Suspend the only thread of the new process**\n\n\n-----\n\nDebugging MosaicLoader, One Step at a Time\n\n**Fig.22. Creating executable memory in the new process that will contain the new image**\n\nWe dumped the MZPE file to the disk to analyze it. It is a small file with no obfuscated parts, and we can quickly see\nthat its goal is to communicate with the C2 server and download the malware sprayer for the final stage.\n\n### Command and Control\n\nIn the binary, we can identify specific strings that characterize this malware family. We found the URL of the C2\nserver hardcoded as a string. In our analyzed sample, the domain was t1[.]cloudshielding[.]xyz, which resolves\nto 195.181.169.92. If we search for previous DNS resolutions, we see the attackers use the same IP in the\ncampaign but with various domain names. In our analysis, we noticed samples connecting to the same IP with\ndomains like c1[.]checkblanco[.]xyz, s1[.]chunkserving[.]com, m1[.]uptime66[.]com, 5a014483-ff8f-467e-a260**28565368d9be[.]certbooster[.]com,** **0129e158-aa17-4900-99a6-30f4a49bd0a4[.]nordlt[.]com, etc. Researchers at**\nFortinet [1] noticed the same IP in their research too.\n\n**Fig.23. URL of C2 in binary**\n\n**Fig.24. Resolving C2 DNS**\n\nBesides the IP, another specific feature of the malware is that it adds “prun” to the User-Agent field of every GET\nrequest. When the server is up and running, it accepts GET requests only with the specific User-Agent and responds\nwith a command and its parameters in an application/json stream.\n\n**Fig.25. User-Agent: prun**\n\nThere communication protocol contains only two commands: “download” and “command”. The first command, as its\nname suggests, saves the delivered payload to the disk. The destination of the file is the root of the %TMP% folder. The\nsecond command executes a specific payload by calling ShellExecuteW on it.\n\n**Fig.26. Download command, for saving payloads to the disk**\n\n\n-----\n\nDebugging MosaicLoader, One Step at a Time\n\n**Fig.28. “Command” command for running payloads**\n\nThe process runs in an infinite loop, periodically sending requests to the C2 server and receiving commands. We\nmanaged to capture some payloads delivered in this phase. All of them are malware sprayers written in .NET. We will\ndiscuss their capabilities in the following section.\n\n### Malware sprayer\n\nThe danger of this payload is that it can deliver any malware on the system. The sprayer’s objective is to download a\nlist of malware from the infection sources controlled by the attackers and to execute them. We have added comments\non the code as guidance.\n\n**Fig.29. Malware sprayer code**\n\nThe response from integral[.]hacking101[.]net contains a list of URLs that host malware. Some have obscure domain\nnames, specifically registered for hosting malware, while others are legitimate Discord URLs with files uploaded to a\npublic channel.\n```\nhxxp://45[.]15[.]143[.]191/redirects/v2.exe\nhxxp://45[.]15[.]143[.]191/uploads/cpu-only.exe\n\n```\nhxxp://45[.]15[.]143[.]191/files/file1.exe\nhxxp://45[.]15[.]143[.]191/files/file2.exe\nhxxp://45[.]15[.]143[.]191/files/file3.exe\nhxxp://45[.]15[.]143[.]191/files/file4.exe\nhxxp://45[.]15[.]143[.]191/files/file5.exe\nhxxp://45[.]15[.]143[.]191/files/file6.exe\nhxxp://45[ ]15[ ]143[ ]191/files/file7 exe\n\n\n-----\n\nDebugging MosaicLoader, One Step at a Time\n\nhxxps://cdn[.]discordapp[.]com/attachments/838446784648052797/841279408946020352/SX.x.1\n```\nhxxp://bandshoo[.]info/app.exe\n\n```\nhxxp://file[.]ekkggr3[.]com/lqosko/p18j/customer2.exe\nhxxp://45[.]15[.]143[.]191/files/file9.exe\nhxxps://cdn[.]discordapp[.]com/attachments/826897158568804390/839908231831617556/jooyu.\n```\nexe\n\n```\nhxxps://cdn[.]discordapp[.]com/attachments/826897158568804390/835108974495662080/setup.\n```\nexe\nhxxp://privacytools[.]xyz/downloads/toolspab2.exe\n\n```\nhxxps://kiff[.]store/builds/KiffApp2.exe\nhxxp://md8[.]8eus[.]pw/download.php\nhxxps://jom[.]diregame[.]live/userf/2201/google-game.exe\nhxxps://cdn[.]discordapp[.]com/attachments/826897158568804390/842095400453406720/Set```\nup2.exe\n\n```\nhxxp://moonlabmediacompany[.]com/campaign1/SunLabsPlayer.exe\nhxxp://www[.]turbosino[.]com/askhelp39/askinstall39.exe\nhxxps://2no[.]co/26ica6\nSome of these files were not available at the time of our analysis, but we could download most of them.

During our analysis, we observed that the payloads delivered by the second stage\nare malware sprayers that download and run many other malicious files. These pieces of malware vary from small\ncookie stealers to cryptocurrency miners and even more advanced threats like Glupteba [4].\n\n\n-----\n\nDebugging MosaicLoader, One Step at a Time\n\nDue to MosaicLoader’s capabilities, user privacy may be severely affected. The malware sprayer can deliver Facebook\ncookie stealers on the system that might exfiltrate login data, resulting in complete account takeovers, posts that can\nharm the reputation of businesses or persons, or posts that spread malware. Other significantly dangerous malware\ndelivered through MosaicLoader are the Remote Access Trojans. They can log keypresses on the system, record\naudio from the microphone and images from the webcam, capture screenshots, etc. With this private information,\nattackers can take over accounts, steal digital identities and attempt to blackmail victims.\n\n## Campaign distribution\n\nThe campaign has no specific target countries or organizations. It just delivers the payloads to victims who search\nfor cracked software. However, due to the nature of the infection source, we expect most of the infected systems to be\npersonal computers.\n\n**Fig.31. Campaign distribution by countries**\n\n\n-----\n\nDebugging MosaicLoader, One Step at a Time\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe attackers behind MosaicLoader created a piece of malware that can deliver any payload on the system, making it\npotentially profitable as a delivery service.\n\nThe malware arrives on target systems by posing as cracked installers. It downloads a malware sprayer that obtains\na list of URLs from the C2 server and downloads the payloads from the received links. We described a unique\nobfuscation technique that shuffles small code chunks resulting in a mosaic-like structure.\n\n### Recommendations\n\nThe best way to defend against MosaicLoader is to avoid downloading cracked software from any source. Besides\nbeing against the law, cybercriminals look to target and exploit users searching for illegal software. We recommend\nto always check the source domain of every download to make sure that the files are legitimate and to keep your\nantimalware and other security solutions up to date.\n\n##
