The botnet is still undergoing active\ndevelopment, experimenting with new features, and attempting to find a brand for itself. After\nour publication, ZeroFox learned that the botnet has undergone a rebranding to more closely\nalign with its administration dashboard. Sometime between January 4, 2022, and January 7,\n2022, the operator(s) began using the names “Anubis” and “Pepega” for the project\ninternally.\n\n## Recommendations\n\nEnsure antivirus and intrusion detection software is up to date with all patches and rule\nsets.\nEnable two-factor authentication for all organizational accounts to help mitigate\nphishing and credential stuffing attacks.\nMaintain regularly scheduled backup routines, including off-site storage and integrity\nchecks.\nAvoid opening unsolicited attachments and never click suspicious links.\nLog and monitor all administrative actions as much as possible. Alert on any suspicious\nactivity.\nReview network logs for potential signs of compromise and data egress.\n\n## Details\n\n\n-----\n\n[ZeroFox Intelligence has been following the development of this previously unknown botnet](https://www.zerofox.com/blog/meet-kraken-a-new-golang-botnet-in-development/)\nsince October 2021. Originally named “Kraken,” builds discovered between January 4, 2022,\nand January 7, 2022, reveal that the internal name has changed.\n\n**Figure 1. On the left, a build from January 4, 2022; on the right, a January 7, 2022, build.**\n\n_Source: ZeroFox Intelligence_\nAs seen in Figure 1, the Golang project path has changed from\n“C:\\Users\\666\\Desktop\\Bobabubs\\kraken_2022” to “\\root\\anubis”, which more closely\naligns with the dashboard after it received its own rebrand. The source code also appears to\nhave been merged into one main file with most of the function names being obfuscated, as\nopposed to the previously separated but clear functionality. Another notable change made is\nto the main source file. The name “pepega” may be in reference to a Twitch emote of the\nsame name, which is itself a variation of the meme “Pepe the Frog.”\n\n## Anubis Dashboard No Longer Available\n\nShortly after our publication, ZeroFox Intelligence also observed that the Anubis dashboard\nis no longer available. Attempting to view the dashboard now results in a “404 page not\nfound” message being displayed.\n\n## New Exfiltration Targets\n\nIn addition to the previously-added cryptocurrency wallets, Anubis now appears to be\ntargeting specific Chromium-based browsers. Builds obtained by ZeroFox Intelligence from\nFebruary 17, 2022, onwards have added the following paths targeting the Brave, Google\nChrome, and Microsoft Edge browsers:\n\n\\AppData\\Local\\BraveSoftware\\Brave-Browser\\User Data\\Default\\Cookies\n\\AppData\\Local\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\Default\\Network\\Cookies\n\n\n-----\n\n\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Edge\\User Data\\Default\\Cookies\n\n**Figure 2. Multiple Chromium-based web browser paths appearing in the latest Anubis build**\n\n_Source: ZeroFox Intelligence_\nUntil recently, Anubis relied entirely on secondary payloads such as Redline to steal data\nfrom victims. If this trend of feature additions continues, Anubis may become capable of\ndoing the job itself, ending its reliance on third-party infostealers.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe additional capability to target a victim’s browser data seems limited to just cookie data\ncurrently. Whether Anubis decides to collect more data (such as saved credentials and\nbrowser history) or even target more browsers based on the Chromium source currently\nremains to be seen. Though the pace of Anubis’ development has slowed down since its\ninitial discovery, the various changes its operator(s) are making indicate they are still\ndeciding what the future of this botnet holds. ZeroFox will continue to monitor this emerging\nbotnet as it evolves.\n\n## MITRE ATT&CK\n\nID Description\n\n[T1027.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/002/) Obfuscated Files or Information: Software Packing\n\n[T1033](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1033/) System Owner/User Discovery\n\n[T1047](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047/) Windows Management Instrumentation\n\n\n-----\n\n[T1059.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001/) Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell\n\n[T1059.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/003/) Command and Scripting Interpreter: Windows Command Shell\n\n[T1082](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1082/) System Information Discovery\n\n[T1113](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1113/) Screen Capture\n\n[T1132.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1132/001/) Data Encoding: Standard Encoding\n\n[T1547.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/001/) Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder\n\n[T1571](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1571/) Non-Standard Port\n\n## IOCs\n\n**SHA256 Hashes**\n\n5d99125b0d97ba0abfcf9916c1a05081c1cc117eb2afaaab39a6f95a60e42ab3\n\n**Tags:** [Botnet,](https://www.zerofox.com/topic/botnet/) [Cybersecurity,](https://www.zerofox.com/topic/cybersecurity/) [Threat Intelligence](https://www.zerofox.com/topic/threat-intelligence/)\n\n\n-----",
