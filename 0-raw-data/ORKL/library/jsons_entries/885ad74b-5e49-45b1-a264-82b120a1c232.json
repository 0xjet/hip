Their usual attack sequence is to create fake domains mimicking\nthe government organization and then deliver the payload. It frequently uses Crimson\n**RAT, a Windows based Remote Admin Tool which provides unauthorized access to a**\nvictim’s device over a network.\n\n[In 2019, we in K7 Labs published an article about Transparent Tribe targeting the CLAWS,](https://labs.k7computing.com/index.php/transparent-tribe-apt-targeting-india/)\na security think tank team affiliated with the Indian Army. Recently similar kinds of attacks\nhave been happening more frequently, targeting state governments and other government\ninstitutions. Transparent Tribe recently targeted the West Bengal government employees\nby sending a spoofed document (of a legitimate government document) which delivers a\nCrimson RAT payload. Our sample of interest now, also delivers a document pretending to\nbe a legitimate survey form by IIT Hyderabad. Once the document is opened, it asks the\nuser to enable a macro through which it can run the VBA script.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1: Survey form with macro\n[We used oletools to extract the VBA script from the macro. We then gleaned that this was](http://decalage.info/python/oletools)\nthe same method which had been used before. The malicious macro contained one Form\nObject for which the first two values are “80” “75” which when converted to ASCII will be\n**“PK” indicating Pakistan that adds suspicion that this attack could be of Pakistan origin.**\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2:\n\nVBA script\nWhile executing the document it runs the VBA script. Like the other Transparent Tribe\nvariants, in this VBA script it creates a new directory E0d1 under C:\\ProgramData\\ and\nwrites the array of values from the VBA into a file Chairtabkjh.zip in that directory. The zip\nfile contains the executable file named Chairtabkjh8.exe which is extracted in the same\npath. The extracted file adds a startup entry to run in the background as a child process of\nthe word document.\n\nFigure 3: Dropped zip\n\n## Analysis\n\nWe identified that the binary Chairtabkjh8.exe is .NET compiled and protected by Crypto[Obfuscator. We used Crypto-Deobfuscator to de-obfuscate the binary for analysis.](https://github.com/Rhotav/Crypto-Deobfuscator)\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4: Compiler details\n\nIt uses AMSI (Anti Malware Scan Interface) bypass technique to escape from scanning\nof AMSI API.\n\nFigure 5: AMSI bypass\nIt also uses Base64 encoding technique to encode the strings and the most common\npersistent technique of adding a run entry for the Chairtabkjh8.exe. The registry path is\nencoded in Base64 and while executing it decodes and adds the run entry.\n\nFigure 6: Base64 encoding\nAfter adding the run entry, the next function executed is for delayed execution technique. It\nperformed a delayed execution technique by holding the execution. It gets the current\nsystem time and holds for 3 minutes before continuing execution.\n\nFigure 7: Delayed\n\nexecution technique\nSince we already know Transparent Tribe uses RAT, this sample that is being analyzed\nmay also use some of these common malicious behaviors of RAT like\n\n\n-----\n\n1. List victim s all files and folders in a C2 specified directory path\n2. Run specific processes at the endpoint keylogger\n3. Gets the information about the image files like image name, size of image and its\n\ncreation time as specified by C2\n4. Take screenshots of the present day display screen and send it to C2.\n5. Forward keylogger logs to the C2.\n6. Send system information including computer name, username etc., to C2\n\nIn this scenario, we found only two such behaviors related to Crimson RAT, first one\nbeing Chairtabkjh8.exe sends system information to C2 including computer name and\nusername. Second activity being it gets the information about the image files like image\nname, size of image and its creation time as specified by C2.\n\nFigure 8:\n\nGets system information\n\nFigure 9: Gets image information\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter collecting the data from the victim s system, it tries to make a TCP connection to\nsend the data to the C2 server sunnyleone[.]hopto[.]org by using different customized\nports each time to connect to the C2. Since the C2 was down at the time of analysis of this\nsample, it was not able to make a successful connection.\n\n**Ports used**\n\n10101\n4401\n3203\n4866\n8832\n\nFigure 10: TCP connection to C2\nIt is always advisable to verify if the files or documents are from reputable sources and\nexercise caution while using them. Also protect your system by using a reputable security\nproduct such as “K7 Total Security” and keep it updated to stay safe from threats.\n\n**Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**\n\n**File Name** **Hash** **Detection Name**\n\n\nAssignment88.docm\n\n\n64C20687676B7A96987D0F9C4F8777B9 Trojan ( 0001140e1\n)\n\n\nChairtabkjh8.exe E3A45FFFAB35F9E0331963A1F1D793DD Trojan ( 005393351\n)\n\n**C2**\n\nhxxps://sunnyleone[.]hopto[.]org\n\n**References**\n\n[https://twitter.com/h2jazi/status/1518382259228844033](https://twitter.com/h2jazi/status/1518382259228844033)\n\n\n-----",
