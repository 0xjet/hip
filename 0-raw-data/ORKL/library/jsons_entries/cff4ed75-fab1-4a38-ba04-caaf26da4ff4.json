We also discovered two\npreviously unknown payloads. These payloads contained backdoors that we have named BYEBY\nand PYLOT respectively.\n\n_Figure 1 Diagram of the attack sequence_\n\n### Phishing Emails\n\n\n-----\n\nfollowing email addresses:\n\n**Email Address** **Description**\n\npress@mod.mil[.]by Press Service of the Ministry of Defense\nof the Republic of Belarus\n\nbaranovichi_eu@mod.mil[.]by Baranovichi Operational Management of\nthe Armed Forces\n\nmodmail@mod.mil[.]by Ministry of Defense of the Republic of\nBelarus\n\nadmin@mod.mil[.]by Ministry of Defense of the Republic of\nBelarus\n\nitsc@mod.mil[.]by Unknown.

The RAR archive contained a series of\nimages, a decoy document, and a Microsoft Windows executable within it. The executable has a .scr\n�le extension, and is designed to look like a Windows folder, as seen below:\n\n_Figure 4 Payload disguising itself as a Microsoft Windows folder_\n\nThe rough translation of the folder and �le names above are ‘Preparations for large-scale West2017 exercises in this format are being held for the �rst time.’ Within the actual folder, there are a\nseries of JPG images, as well as a decoy document with a title that is translated to ‘Thousands of\nRussian and Belarusian military are involved in the training of the rear services.’\n\n_Figure 5 Embedded images and decoy document within RAR_\n\nThe decoy document contains the following content:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6 Decoy document within RAR_\n\nThe other RTF and Word documents used additional decoy documents, which can be seen below.\n\n_Figure 7 Decoy document with translation (1/2)_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8 Decoy document with translation (2/2)_\n\nWhile we observed different techniques being used for delivery, all attachments executed a variant\nof the CMSTAR malware family. We observed minor changes between variants, which we discuss in\nthe CMSTAR Variations and Payloads section of the blog post.\n\nThe Word documents, which we track as Werow, employ malicious macros for their delivery. More\ninformation about these macros may be found in the Appendix of the blog post. Additionally, we\nhave included a script that extracts these embedded payloads that can also be found in the\nAppendix.\n\nThe RTF documents made use of CVE-2015-1641 (https://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?\nname=CVE-2015-1641). This vulnerability, patched in 2015, allows attackers to execute malicious\ncode when these specially crafted documents are opened within vulnerable instances of Microsoft\nWord. The payload for these samples is embedded within them and obfuscated using a 4-byte XOR\nkey of 0xCAFEBABE. We have included a script that can be used to extract the underlying payload\nof these RTFs statically that can be found in the Appendix.\n\nThe SCR �le mentioned previously drops a CMSTAR DLL and runs it via an external call to\nrundll32.exe.\n\n### CMSTAR Variations and Payloads\n\nIn total, we observed three variations of CMSTAR in these recent attacks against Belarusian\ntargets. The biggest change observed between them looks to be minor modi�cations made to the\nstring obfuscation routine. A very simple modi�cation to the digit used in subtraction was modi�ed\nbetween the variants, as shown below:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 9 String obfuscation modi�cations between CMSTAR variants_\n\nThe older variation, named CMSTAR.A, was discussed in a previous blog post entitled, “Digital\nQuartermaster Scenario Demonstrated in Attacks Against the Mongolian Government\n(https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/03/digital-quartermaster-scenariodemonstrated-in-attacks-against-the-mongolian-government/).”\n\nThe CMSTAR.B variant was witnessed using both a different mutex from CMSTAR.A, as well as a\nslightly modi�ed string obfuscation routine. The mutexes used by CMSTAR ensure that only one\ninstance of the malware runs at a time. The CMSTAR.C variant used the same mutex as CMSTAR.B,\nhowever, again used another slightly modi�ed string obfuscation routine. We found all CMSTAR\nvariants using the same obfuscation routine when I payload was downloaded from a remote server.\nWe have included a tool to extract mutex and C2 information from all three CMSTAR variants, as\nwell as a tool to decode the downloaded payload: both may be found in the Scripts section.\n\nAn example of CMSTAR downloading its payload may be found below:\n\n_Figure 10 Example HTTP download by CMSTAR_\n\nWhen expanding the research to identify additional CMSTAR.B and CMSTAR.C variants, we\nidenti�ed a total of 31 samples. Of these 31 samples, we found two unique payloads served from\nthree of the C2 URLS—One of which was downloaded from a sample found in the phishing attacks\npreviously described. Both payloads contained previously unknown malware families. We have\nnamed the payload found in the email campaign PYLOT, and the malware downloaded from the\nadditional CMSTAR samples BYEBY.\n\nBoth malware families acted as backdoors, allowing the attackers to execute commands on the\nvictim machine, as well as a series of other functions. More information about these individual\nmalware families may be found in the appendix.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nDuring the course of this research, we identi�ed a phishing campaign consisting of 20 unique emails\ntargeting the government of Belarus. The ploys used in these email and decoy documents revolved\naround a joint strategic military exercise of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation and the\nRepublic of Belarus, which took place between September 14 and September 20 of this year.th th\n\n\n-----\n\nfamily. Between the samples identi�ed and others we found while expanding our research scope,\nwe identi�ed two previously unknown malware families.\n\nPalo Alto customers are protected from this threat in the following ways:\n\nTags have been created in AutoFocus to track CMSTAR\n(https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.Cmstar), BYEBY\n(https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.BYEBY), and PYLOT\n(https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.PYLOT)\nAll observed samples are identi�ed as malicious in WildFire\nDomains observed to act as C2s have been �agged as malicious\nTraps 4.1 identi�es and blocks the CVE-2015-1641 exploit used in these documents\nTraps 4.1 blocks the macros used in the malicious Word documents\n\nA special thanks to Tom Lancaster for his assistance on this research.\n\n### Appendix\n\n#### Werow Macro Analysis\n\nThe attacker used the same macro dropper all of the observed Microsoft Word documents we\nanalyzed for this campaign. It begins by building the following path strings:\n\n%APPDATA%\\d.doc\n%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Of�ce\\WinCred.acl\n\nThe ‘d.doc’ path will be used to store a copy of the Word document, while the ‘WinCred.acl’ will\ncontain the dropped payload, which is expected to be a DLL.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 11 Macro used to drop CMSTAR_\n\n\n-----\n\nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\WinCred\nrundll32 %APPDATA%\\Microsof\\Of�ce\\WinCred.acl,WinCred\n\nThese strings will be used at the end of the macro’s execution to ensure persistence via the Run\nregistry key.\n\nThe malware proceeds to read an included overlay within the original Word document from a given\noffset. This data is decoded using and XOR operation, as well as an addition operation. It can be\nrepresented in Python as follows:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n\n\ndef decrypt_xor(data, key, key_offset):\noutput = \"\"\nseed = ord(key)\nfor d in data:\nord_d = ord(d)\nif ord_d != 0 and ord_d != seed:\nnvalue = ord_d ^ seed\nseed = (seed + key_offset) % 0x100\noutput += chr(nvalue)\nelse:\noutput += d\nreturn output\n\n\nOnce this overlay is decoded, it is written to the ‘WinCred.acl’ �le and loaded with the ‘WinCred’\nexport. A script has been provided in the Scripts section that, in conjunction with oletools, can\nstatically extract the embedded DLL payload from these documents.\n\n#### RTF Shellcode Analysis\n\nThe RTF documents delivered in this attack campaign appear to be created by the same builder. All\nof the RTF �les attempt to exploit CVE-2015-1641 to execute shellcode on the targeted system.\nPlease reference https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/ms15-033.aspx for more\ninformation.\n\nThe shellcode executed after successful exploitation begins by resolving the API functions it\nrequires by enumerating the API functions within loaded modules in the current process. It then\nbuilds the following list of values:\n\nThe shellcode then enumerates the API functions, subjects them to a ROR7 hashing routine and\nXORs the resulting hash with 0x10ADBEEF. It uses the result of this arithmetic to compare with the\nlist of values above to �nd the API functions it requires to carry out its functionality.\n\n**ROR7** **ROR7^0x10ADBEEF API Func**\n\n1a22f51 110f91be WinExec\n\n741f8dc4 64b2332b WriteFile\n\n94e43293 84498c7c CreateFileA\n\n|ROR7|ROR7^0x10ADBEEF|API Func|\n|---|---|---|\n|1a22f51|110f91be|WinExec|\n|741f8dc4|64b2332b|WriteFile|\n\n\n-----\n\n|daa7fe52|ca0a40bd|UnmapViewOfFile|\n|---|---|---|\n|dbacbe43|cb0100ac|SetFilePointer|\n|ec496a9e|fce4d471|GetEnvironmentVariableA|\n|ff0d6657|efa0d8b8|CloseHandle|\n\n\nAfter resolving the API functions, the shellcode then begins searching for the embedded payload\nand decoy within the initial RTF �le. It does so by searching the RTF �le for three delimiters,\nspeci�cally 0xBABABABABABA, 0xBBBBBBBB and 0xBCBCBCBC, which the shellcode uses to\n�nd the encrypted payload and decoy. The shellcode then decrypts the payload by XOR’ing four\nbytes at at time with the key 0xCAFEBABE, and decrypts the decoy by XOR’ing four bytes at a time\nusing the key 0xBAADF00D. Here is a visual representation of the delimiters and embedded �les:\n\nAfter decrypting the payload, it saves the �le to the following location:\n\n%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Of�ce\\OutL12.pip\n\nThe shellcode then creates the following registry key to automatically run the payload each time\nthe system starts:\n\nSoftware\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run : Microsoft\n\nThe shellcode saves the following command to this autorun key, which will execute the OutL12.pip\npayload, speci�cally calling its ‘WinCred’ exported function:\n\nrundll32.exe\n“%APPDATA\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Of�ce\\OutL12.pip”,WinCred\n\nThe shellcode will then overwrite the original delivery document with the decrypted decoy\ncontents and open the new document.\n\n#### PYLOT Analysis\n\nThis malware family was named via a combination of the DLLs original name of ‘pilot.dll’, along with\nthe fact it downloads �les with a Python (.py) �le extension.\n\nPYLOT begins by being loaded as a DLL with the ServiceMain export. It proceeds to create the\nfollowing two folders within the %TEMP% path:\n\nKB287640\nKB887209\n\n\n-----\n\ninformation that is used by the malware throughout its execution. The following script, written in\nPython, may be used to decode this embedded resource object:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n\n\nimport sys\nimport hexdump\n\nfile = sys.argv[1]\nfh = open(file, 'rb')\nfdata = list(fh.read())\nfh.close()\n\nfdata_len = len(fdata)\nc = fdata_len-1\n\noutput = \"\"\nwhile c &gt; 1:\nfdata[c] = chr( ord(fdata[c]) ^ ord(fdata[c-2]) )\nc -= 1\n\nfdata = ''.join(fdata)\nhexdump.hexdump(fdata)\n\n\nLooking at the decoded data, we see the following:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 12 Decoded embedded con�guration information_\n\nThe malware continues to collect the following information from the victim computer:\n\nComputer name\nIP addresses present on the machine\nMAC addresses\nMicrosoft Windows version information\nWindows code page identi�er information\n\nThis information is used to generate a unique hash for the victim machine. PYLOT then begins\nentering its C2 handler routine, where it will use HTTP for communication with the remote host.\n\nData sent to the remote C2 server is encrypted using RC4 with the previously shown key of\n‘BBidRotnqQpHfpRTi8cR.’ It is then further obfuscated by base64-encoding this encrypted string.\nAn example of this HTTP request containing this data can be seen below.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 13 HTTP request made by PYLOT to remote server_\n\nThe decrypted data sent in the request above is as follows. Note that all of this custom data format\nhas not been fully identi�ed, however, we’re able to see various strings, including the embedded\ncon�guration string of ‘fGAka0001’, as well as the victim hash of ‘100048048.’\n\n_Figure 14 Decrypted data sent by PYLOT to remote server_\n\nThe base64-encoded string at the end of the data contains the collected victim machine\ninformation from earlier, separated by a ‘|’ delimiter.\n\nThe remote C2 server responds using the same data format. An example response can be seen\nbelow.\n\n\n-----\n\nreceive commands, as well as other information that has yet to be fully researched.\n\n\n1 /duakzu/furs.py|/ugvrf/pvoi.py|/tydfw/pld.py|/bpnij/syau.py|/plugin/plugin.py|eycHhHKVQUnuA\nwtNchvYjScGYMtVMzMqYmxBmCEwieQpKgsokpvrxknPQRvnkOHDywCImVZxHxRdvlePjgnbPXsyTzreBEckVVFbuUHH\ncvLPGmqxHUNWondMIntBiVVO|CgpQxWOeTAbOLpOCdWtesymHSqjeSUYPQFBeUnbhXElorlcjqldwEMVucaDwJRhuzZ\njprKkZEPvLEWUbkEQxFUqzqIRQwyuTaBmOZSOpfJRByRvyTHjSVdVeihtkbcnG|GqPfDIAHOik/\n\n\nA number of commands have been identi�ed within PYLOT, including the following:\n\n- Download batch script\n\n- Run batch script\n\n- Delete �le\n\n- Rename �le\n\n- Execute �le\n\n- Download �le\n\n- Upload �le\n\n#### BYEBY Analysis\n\nBYEBY was named based on a string within the malware itself. Most strings found within this\nmalware are concatenated to 6 characters. One such example was an instance where a debug string\ncontained ‘BYE BY’, which was likely a concatenated form of the phrase ‘BYE BYE’.\n\nThis malware is loaded as a DLL, with an export name of ServiceMain. When the malware is initially\nloaded, it begins by checking to see if it is running within either of the following paths:\n\n[SYSTEM32]\\svchost.exe\n\n[SYSTEM32]\\rundll32.exe\n\nIf it �nds itself not running in either location, it will immediately exit. This is likely a technique used\nto bypass various sandboxing systems. Should it �nd itself running as svchost.exe, it will write the\ncurrent timestamp and a value of ‘V09SS010’ (Base64 Decoded: ‘WORKMN’) to a �le named\n‘vmunisvc.cab’ within the user’s local %TEMP% folder. This �le acts as a lot �le and is written to\nfrequently throughout the malware’s execution.\n\nWhen the malware runs within the context of svchost.exe, it bypasses the installation routines and\nimmediately enters the C2 handler.\n\nWhen BYEBY is run within the context of rundll32.exe, it expects itself to be running for the �rst\ntime. As such, it will register itself as a service with a name of ‘VideoSrv.’ After this service is created,\nBYEBY proceeds to enter it’s C2 handler function in a new thread.\n\nBYEBY uses TLS for network communication, connecting to the following host on port 443:\n\noeiowid�a22[.]com\n\nAfter the initial connection is established, BYEBY will collect the following system information and\nupload it to the remote C2:\n\nHostname\nIP Address\nEmbedded String of ‘WinVideo’\nMajor Windows Version\nMinor Windows Version\nEmbedded String of ‘6.1.7603.16000’\n\n\n-----\n\nstrings that, when decoded, provide their true meaning. Only the beginning of the commands are\nchecked. The Base64-decoded strings have been included for the bene�t of the reader.\n\naGVsbG8h [Decoded: hello!]\nR09PREJZ [Decoded: GOODBY]\nTElTVCBE [Decoded: LIST D]\nU1RBUlRD [Decoded: STARTC]\nQ09NTUFO [Decoded: COMMAN]\nVFJBTlNG [Decoded: TRANSF]\nRVhFQ1VU [Decoded: EXECUT]\n\nA mapping of commands and their descriptions has been provided:\n\n**Command** **Description**\n\naGVsbG8h Authenticate with the remote C2 server.\n\nR09PREJZ Close socket connection with remote server.\n\nTElTVCBE List drives on the victim machine.\n\nU1RBUlRD Start an interactive shell on the victim machine.\n\nQ09NTUFO Execute a command in the interactive shell\n\nVFJBTlNG Upload or download �les to the victim machine.\n\nRVhFQ1VU Execute command in a new process.\n#### Scripts\n\nWe created multiple scripts during the course of our research.
