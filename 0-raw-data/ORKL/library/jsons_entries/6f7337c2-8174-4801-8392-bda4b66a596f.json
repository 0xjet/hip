You can read the full report at:\n\n[PLATINUM: Targeted attacks in South and Southeast Asia](http://download.microsoft.com/download/2/2/5/225BFE3E-E1DE-4F5B-A77B-71200928D209/Platinum%20feature%20article%20-%20Targeted%20attacks%20in%20South%20and%20Southeast%20Asia%20April%202016.pdf)\n\nThere is no shortage of headlines about cybercriminals launching large-scale attacks against\norganizations. For us, the activity groups that pose the most danger are the ones who\nselectively target organizations and desire to stay undetected, protect their investment, and\nmaximize their ROI. That’s what motivated us – the Windows Defender Advanced Threat\nHunting team, known as hunters – when we recently discovered a novel technique being\nused by one such activity group.\n\nWe have code named this group PLATINUM, following our internal practice of assigning\nrogue actors chemical element names. Based on our investigations, we know PLATINUM\nhas been active since 2009 and primarily targets governmental organizations, defense\ninstitutes, intelligence agencies, and telecommunication providers in South and Southeast\nAsia. The group has gone to great lengths to develop covert techniques that allow them to\nconduct cyber-espionage campaigns for years without being detected.\n\nUncovering these kinds of techniques is true detective work, and finding them in the wild is a\nchallenge, but with the wealth of anonymized information we can utilize from over 1 billion\nWindows devices, a broad spectrum of services, Microsoft’s intelligent security graph as well\nas advanced analytics and machine algorithms to surface suspicious behaviors, Microsoft is\nin the best position to do so.\n\n### Digging up the nugget\n\n\nThrough our advanced and persistent hunting, we discovered PLATINUM is using\nhotpatching as a technique to attempt to cloak a backdoor they use. Using hotpatching in the\nmalicious context has been theorized [1], [2], but has not been observed in the wild before.\nFinding such techniques is a focus of the Microsoft APT hunter team, and we want to provide\nsome brief insights on how the team dug up this PLATINUM “nugget”.\n\nIn the first part of this methodology, a hunter carves out some rough data sets from existing\ninformation and data that can be further analyzed. This could be based on rough heuristics,\nsuch as looking for files with high entropy, that were first observed recently, and that are\nconfined to a geographic region that fits the profile of the activity group being investigated.\n\n\n-----\n\nCarving the data still yields large data sets that can t be manually analyzed, and advanced\nthreat analytics can help in sorting through the data for meaningful information in the second\nstep. Graph inferences through the Microsoft intelligent security graph can bubble pieces of\ninformation to the top of the queue for a hunter to choose from. In the PLATINUM\ninvestigation, we identified 31 files.\n\nLastly, the hunter works directly with the resulting set. During this stage of the PLATINUM\ninvestigation, a hunter found a file with unusual string (“.hotp1”). The hunter’s experience and\nintuition drove him to dig deeper. In this case, that further investigation led us to the\nmalicious use of hotpatching by this activity group and the “nugget” was uncovered.\n\n### Deconstructing the attack\n\nSo what is hotpatching? Hotpatching is a previously supported OS feature for installing\nupdates without having to reboot or restart a process. It requires administrator-level\npermissions, and at a high level, a hotpatcher can transparently apply patches to\nexecutables and DLLs in actively running processes.\n\nUsing hotpatching in a malicious context is a technique that can be used to avoid being\ndetected, as many antimalware solutions monitor non-system processes for regular injection\nmethods, such as CreateRemoteThread. Hotpatching originally shipped with Windows\nServer 2003 and was used to ship 10 patches to Windows Server 2003. Windows 10, our\nmost secure operating system ever, is not susceptible to this and many other techniques and\nattack vectors.\n\nWhat this means in practical terms is that PLATINUM was able to abuse this feature to hide\ntheir backdoor from the behavioral sensors of many host security products. We first observed\na sample employing the hotpatching technique on a machine in Malaysia. This allowed\nPLATINUM to gain persistent access to the networks of companies it targeted and victimized\nover a long period without being detected.\n\n### Thwarting the bad guys\n\nThe Microsoft APT hunter team actively tracks activity groups like PLATINUM. We\nproactively identify these groups and the techniques they use and work to address\nvulnerabilities and implement security mitigations. The team builds detections and threat\nintelligence that are utilized by many of our products and services. Beta users of Windows\nDefender ATP can take advantage of this additional layer of protection and intelligence for a\nbroad set of activity groups.\n\nWe’ve included a more technical exploration of our research and detection of the hotpatching\ntechnique in the remainder of this blog.\n\n\n-----\n\nYou can also see a closer look at the PLATINUM activity group in our report PLATINUM:\nTargeted attacks in South and Southeast Asia. Windows Defender Advanced Threat\nProtection beta and preview users can also find the report, along with other APT activity\ngroup reports, in the Windows Defender ATP portal.\n\nWe continue to dig for PLATINUM.\n\n_The Windows Defender Advanced Threat Hunting Team_\n\n## Hotpatching – a case study\n\nWe first observed the sample (Sample1) that is capable of utilizing hotpatching on a machine\nin Malaysia (which matches the general target profile of PLATINUM) on January 28, 2016 .\nThe portable executable (PE) timestamp, which can be arbitrarily set by the adversary, dates\nback to August 9, 2015, while the unpacked version contains a PE timestamp for November\n26, 2015.\n\nIt is a DLL that runs as a service and serves as an injector component of a backdoor.\nInterestingly, this sample not only supported the hotpatching technique described in this post,\nbut was able to apply more common code-injection techniques, including the following, into\ncommon Windows processes (primarily targeting winlogon.exe, lsass.exe and svchost.exe):\n\nCreateRemoteThread\nNtQueueApcThread to run an APC in a thread in the target process\nRtlCreatUserThread\nNtCreateThreadEx\n\n### Hotpatching technique\n\nFor hotpatching, the sample goes through the following steps:\n\n1. It patches the loader with a proper hotpatch to treat injected DLLs with execute page\n\npermissions. This step is required for DLLs loaded from memory (in an attempt to\nfurther conceal the malicious code).\n2. The backdoor is injected into svchost using the hotpatch API.\n\nPatching the loader is done by creating a section named “\\knowndlls\\mstbl.dll”. This DLL\ndoes not reside on-disk, but is rather treated as a cached DLL by the session manager.\n\nIt then proceeds to write a PE file within that section. The PE file will have one section\n(“.hotp1 “) with the hotpatch header structure. This structure contains all the information\nnecessary to perform the patching of the function “ntdll!LdrpMapViewOfSection” used by the\nloader, such that the loader will treat created sections as PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE\ninstead of PAGE_READWRITE. The patch is successfully applied by invoking\nNtSetSystemInformation.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1: The malware builds the information describing the first patch\n\nFigure 2: The highlighted “push 4” is patched to “push 0x40”, meaning that the parameter for\nthe following API call NtMapViewOfSection is changed from PAGE_READWRITE to\nPAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE.\nNow that the memory permission issue has been solved, the injector can proceed with\ninjecting the malicious DLL into svchost. Again, it creates a (now executable) section named\n“knowndlls\\fgrps.dll” and invokes NtSetSystemInformation, causing the final payload to be\nloaded and executed within the target process (svchost).\n\n\n-----\n\nTrying to hide the payload using hotpatching also falls in line with the last functional insights\nwe have on the sample. It seems to have an expiry date of January 15, 2017 – at that point\nin time, the DLL will no longer perform the injection, but rather execute another PLATINUM\nimplant:\n\n_C:\\program files\\Windows Journal\\Templates\\Cpl\\jnwmon.exe –ua_\n\nThis implant may be related to an uninstall routine. Note that we observed the sample last on\nthe machine on September 3, 2015, which may indicate PLATINUM pulled the trigger earlier.\n\n[1] [http://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-usa-06/BH-US-06-Sotirov.pdf](http://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-usa-06/BH-US-06-Sotirov.pdf)\n\n[2] [https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/view/14255220/alexsyscan13](https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/view/14255220/alexsyscan13)\n\n**Talk to us**\n\n[Questions, concerns, or insights on this story?
