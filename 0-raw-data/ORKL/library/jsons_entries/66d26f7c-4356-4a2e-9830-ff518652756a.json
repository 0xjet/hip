    "plain_text": "# ZeuS spreading via Facebook\n\n**eternal-todo.com/blog/zeus-spreading-facebook**\n\nZeuS is still the talk of the town. It's downloaded through fake antivirus, downloaders and\nseveral exploit kits. Of course, the best-known social networking site couldn't be out of\nthis. Last week we could see some Facebook messages like the following:\n\nThe link in the message would take the users to a Facebook phishing page where they\nwere requested to authenticate. Simultaneously, obfuscated Javascript code was being\nexecuted, creating a hidden iframe in the page body:\n\nThis iframe redirected the user to another web page with two more iframes:\n\n<iframe g1g=\"321\" src=\"xd/pdf.pdf\" l=\"56\" height=\"31\" width=\"13\">\n\n<iframe g1g=\"321\" src=\"xd/sNode.php\" l=\"56\" height=\"31\" width=\"13\">\n\nAfter advancing further, we arrived to a directory listing in the same server:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe PDF file intended to be downloaded was a malicious file executing obfuscated\nJavascript code and containing three vulnerabilities, which were exploited depending on\nthe PDF reader version in use:\n\nThe three exploits had identical shellcode:\n\n\n-----\n\n[As it can see seen, the shellcode allowed downloading and launching a binary from the](http://www.virustotal.com/analisis/1d45b5acfbdcdf803ac25522d3c3395ff9416a9e8bd3928dba94da64b64b829e-1264762742)\nURL of the last image. This binary was a ZeuS sample, version 1.3.2.4, which was\ninstalled in the system as sdra64.exe.\n\nOn the other hand, the sNode.php file would try to exploit a flash vulnerability through the\nexecution of the [nowTrue.swf file after loading in memory a shellcode very similar to the](http://www.virustotal.com/analisis/de54327ae5b208f1f45704d41ef03c02758f7f12c2f63907db70429629c44df3-1264464990)\nlast one, but in this case the binary was downloaded from the following URL:\n\nhxxp://109.95.115.35/fsp/load.php?id=5\n\nThis [binary had a different MD5, but its behavior was identical, being a 1.3.2.4. version](http://www.virustotal.com/analisis/11cd4b85e28fdc01095813cb3d7bf8037e2a15820e3e93ab26b5c5687f87d88a-1265052410)\nZeuS too.\n\nAdditionally, when the data requested is filled in the Facebook phishing page they are sent\nto another URL. At the moment of the analysis this URL contained an incorrect domain,\nnot redirecting correctly:\n\nHowever, after changing this malformed domain by the IP server, it became possible to get\nto the desired web page, where a pop-up would inform about the need to upload the\n[Adobe Flash Player version and provide a new binary called update.exe to do it. There](http://www.virustotal.com/analisis/1999ba265cd51c94e8ae3a6038b3775bf9a49d6fe57d75dbf1726921af8a7ab2-1265054045)\nwas another link in the same page to download another binary, photo.exe, with the same\nMD5 as update.exe. Both of them have a different MD5 than the rest of commented\nbinaries, but they still have the same behavior: 1.3.2.4 version ZeuS.\n\n\n-----\n\nIf unfortunately any of you have visited any of the mentioned links you can check if you are\n[infected following the tips published some months ago.](http://eternal-todo.com/blog/detecting-zeus)\n\nSubmitted by jesparza on Tue, 2010/02/02 - 12:45\n\n[Español](http://eternal-todo.com/es/blog/zeus-distribucion-facebook)\n\n\n-----",
