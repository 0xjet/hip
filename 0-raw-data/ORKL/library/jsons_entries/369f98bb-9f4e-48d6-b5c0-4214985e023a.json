Components of TG-4127 operations have been reported under the names APT28,](https://www.secureworks.com/research/threat-group-4127-targets-hillary-clinton-presidential-campaign)\nSofacy, Sednit, Fancy Bear, and Pawn Storm. CTU™ researchers assess with moderate confidence that the group\nis operating from the Russian Federation and is gathering intelligence on behalf of the Russian government.\n\n[In June 2016, CTU researchers published analysis of a TG-4127 campaign that targeted email accounts linked to](https://www.secureworks.com/research/threat-group-4127-targets-hillary-clinton-presidential-campaign)\nHillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign and the U.S. Democrat National Committee. The activity used the same\ntechnique as a 2015 spearphishing campaign that targeted more than 1,800 Google Accounts. The threat group\nused the Bitly URL-shortening service to hide the location of a spoofed Google login page. Many of the accounts in\nthe 2015 campaign belonged to individuals in Russia and the former Soviet states, but some belonged to current\nand former military and government personnel in the U.S. and Europe, individuals working in the defense and\ngovernment supply chain, and authors and journalists, particularly those with an interest in Russia. The range of\ntargets demonstrates that the threat group poses a broad threat to individuals and groups associated with U.S.\npolitics, to organizations and individuals in the government and defense verticals, and to those whose business\ninvolves commenting on Russia.\n\n## Spearphishing Google Accounts\n\nIn mid-2015, CTU researchers discovered TG-4127 using the accoounts-google . com domain in spearphishing\nattacks targeting Google Account users. The domain was used in a phishing URL submitted to Phishtank, a website\nthat allows users to report phishing links (see Figure 1).\n\n_Figure 1. Example of accoounts-google . com used in a phishing URL. (Source: www.phishtank.com)_\n\nRecipients who clicked the link were presented with a fake Google Account login page (see Figure 2). The threat\nactors could use entered credentials to access the contents of the associated Gmail account.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2. Fake Google Account login page. (Source: www.phishtank.com)_\n\n### Encoded target details\n\nAnalysis of the phishing URL revealed that it includes two Base64-encoded values (see Figure 3). The decoded\nBase64 values (see Table 1) match the Gmail account and its associated Google Account username. If a target\nclicks the phishing link, the username field of the displayed fake Google Account login page is prepopulated with the\nindividual’s email address.\n\n_Figure 3. Spearphishing URL. (Source: SecureWorks)_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Table 1. Decoded Base64 values from the phishing URL used by TG-4127._\n\n### Use of the Bitly URL-shortening service\n\nA Bitly URL was uploaded to Phishtank at almost the same time as the original spearphishing URL (see Figure 4).\n\n_Figure 4. Bitly phishing URL submitted at same time as accoounts-google . com phishing URL. (Source:_\n_www.phishtank.com)_\n\nUsing a tool on Bitly’s website, CTU researchers determined that the Bitly URL redirected to the original phishing\nURL (see Figure 5). Analysis of activity associated with the Bitly account used to create the shortened URL revealed\nthat it had been used to create more than 3,000 shortened links used to target more than 1,800 Google Accounts.\n\n_Figure 5. Link-shortener page for bit.ly/1PXQ8zP that reveals the full URL. (Source: www.bit.ly)_\n\n## Target analysis\n\nCTU researchers analyzed the Google Accounts targeted by TG-4127 to gain insight about the targets and the\nthreat group’s intent.\n\n### Focus on Russia and former Soviet states\n\nMost of the targeted accounts are linked to intelligence gathering or information control within Russia or former\nSoviet states. The majority of the activity appears to focus on Russia’s military involvement in eastern Ukraine; for\nexample the email address targeted by the most phishing attempts (nine) was linked to a spokesperson for the\n\n\n-----\n\n### Other targets worldwide\n\nAnalysis of targeted individuals outside of Russia and the former Soviet states revealed that they work in a wide\nrange of industry verticals (see Figure 6). The groups can be divided into two broad categories:\n\nAuthors, journalists, NGOs, and political activists (36%)\n\nGovernment personnel, military personnel, government supply chain, and aerospace researchers (64%)\n\nTG-4127 likely targeted the groups in the first category because they criticized Russia. The groups in the second\ncategory may have information useful to the Russian government.\n\n_Figure 6. TG-4127 targeting outside of Russia and former Soviet states. (Source: SecureWorks)_\n\n### Authors and journalists\n\nMore than half (53%) of the targeted authors and journalists are Russia or Ukraine subject matter experts (see\nFigure 7). It is likely that the Russian state has an interest in how it is portrayed in the media. U.S.-based military\nspouses who wrote online content about the military and military families were also targeted. The threat actors may\nhave been attempting to learn about broader military issues in the U.S., or gain operational insight into the military\nactivity of the target’s spouse.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7. Subject matter expertise of authors and journalists targeted by TG-4127. (Source: SecureWorks)_\n\n### Government supply chain\n\nCTU researchers identified individuals who were likely targeted due to their position within the supply chain of\norganizations of interest to TG-4127 (e.g., defense and government networks). Figure 8 shows the distribution by\ncategory. The targets included a systems engineer working on a military simulation tool, a consultant specializing in\nunmanned aerial systems, an IT security consultant working for NATO, and a director of federal sales for the security\narm of a multinational technology company. The threat actors likely aimed to exploit the individuals’ access to and\nknowledge of government clients’ information.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8. Categories of supply chain targets. (Source: SecureWorks)_\n\n### Government / military personnel\n\nTG-4127 likely targeted current and former military and government personnel for potential operational insight\ngained from access to their personal communications. Most of the activity focused on individuals based in the U.S.\nor working in NATO-linked roles (see Figure 9).\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 9. Nation or organization of government/military targets. (Source: SecureWorks)_\n\nTG-4127 targeted high-profile Syrian rebel leaders, including a leader of the Syrian National Coalition. Russian\nforces have supported Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime since September 2015, so it is likely the threat\nactors are seeking to gain intelligence on rebel forces to assist Russian and Assad regime military operations.\n\n## Success of the phishing campaign\n\nCTU researchers analyzed 4,396 phishing URLs sent to 1,881 Google Accounts between March and September,\n2015. More than half (59%) of the URLs were accessed, suggesting that the recipients at least opened the phishing\npage. From the available data, it is not possible to determine how many of those Google Accounts were\ncompromised. Most of the targeted accounts received multiple phishing attempts, which may indicate that previous\nattempts had been unsuccessful. However, 35% of accounts that accessed the malicious link were not subject to\nadditional attempts, possibly indicating that the compromise was successful.\nOf the accounts targeted once, CTU researchers determined that 60% of the recipients clicked the malicious Bitly.\nOf the accounts that were targeted more than once, 57% of the recipients clicked the malicious link in the repeated\nattempts. These results likely encourage threat actors to make additional attempts if the initial phishing email is\nunsuccessful.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTG-4127 primarily poses a threat to organizations and individuals operating in Russia and former Soviet states.\n\n\n-----\n\nRussia subject matter experts\n\nIndividuals and organizations that publish articles portraying Russia in a negative context\n\nDefense or government organizations\n\nOrganizations and individuals involved in the government supply chain\n\nFormer military or government personnel\n\nIndividuals associated with U.S. politics\n\nUsers rarely check the full URL associated with URLs generated by a URL-shortening service, so threat groups can\nuse these services to effectively hide phishing website URLs. URL-shortening services provide detailed statistics\nabout which links were clicked when, and from what location. This information allows threat actors to track the\nsuccess of a spearphishing campaign. Access to an individual’s email account provides a substantial amount of\nuseful intelligence. Threat actors could also use control of an account to launch additional attacks to penetrate the\nnetwork of an associated organization.\n\nOrganizations should educate users about the risks of spearphishing and shortened links. CTU researchers\nrecommend using caution and exercising due diligence when faced with a shortened link, especially in unsolicited\nemail messages. Pasting Bitly URLs, appended with a plus sign, into the address bar of a web browser reveals the\nfull URL.\n\n## Appendix — Gauging confidence level\n\nCTU researchers have adopted the grading system published by the U.S. Office of the Director of National\nIntelligence to indicate confidence in their assessments:\n\n**High confidence generally indicates that judgments are based on high-quality information, and/or that the**\nnature of the issue makes it possible to render a solid judgment. A \"high confidence\" judgment is not a fact or\na certainty, however, and such judgments still carry a risk of being wrong.\n\n**Moderate confidence generally means that the information is credibly sourced and plausible but not of**\nsufficient quality or corroborated sufficiently to warrant a higher level of confidence.\n\n**Low confidence generally means that the information's credibility and/or plausibility is questionable, or that**\nthe information is too fragmented or poorly corroborated to make solid analytic inferences, or that [there are]\nsignificant concerns or problems with the sources.\n\n### Footnote\n\n1 The SecureWorks Counter Threat Unit (CTU) research team tracks threat groups by assigning them four-digit\nrandomized numbers (4127 in this case), and compiles information from first-hand incident response observations\nand from external sources.\n\n\n-----",
