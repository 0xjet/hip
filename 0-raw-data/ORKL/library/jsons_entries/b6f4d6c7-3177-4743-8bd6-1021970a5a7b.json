When\nencrypting files, the files will have the '.n3tw0rm' extension appended to their names.\n\nWhile BleepingComputer does not have access to the server executable, we set up NetCat\nto listen and wait for connections on port 80. We then launched the slave.exe client, so it\nconnects back to our IP address on that port.\n\nAs you can see below, when the client connects back to port 80 on our device running\nNetCat, it will send an RSA key to the server.\n\n**Sending an RSA key back to the N3TW0RM server**\n\n_Source: BleepingComputer_\nNachmias told BleepingComputer that the server component would save these keys in a file\nand then direct the clients to begin encrypting devices.\n\nThis approach allows the threat actor to keep all aspects of the ransomware operation within\nthe victim's network without being traced back to a remote command & control server.\n\nHowever, it also adds complexity to the attack and could allow a victim to recover their\ndecryption keys if all of the files are not removed after an attack\n\n\n-----\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Costa Rica declares national emergency after Conti ransomware attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/costa-rica-declares-national-emergency-after-conti-ransomware-attacks/)\n\n[New Black Basta ransomware springs into action with a dozen breaches](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-black-basta-ransomware-springs-into-action-with-a-dozen-breaches/)\n\n[American Dental Association hit by new Black Basta ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/american-dental-association-hit-by-new-black-basta-ransomware/)\n\n[Wind turbine firm Nordex hit by Conti ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/wind-turbine-firm-nordex-hit-by-conti-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[Hackers use Conti's leaked ransomware to attack Russian companies](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-use-contis-leaked-ransomware-to-attack-russian-companies/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
