As of](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/emailaddress.xhtml?emailaddress=wayne.williams1986%40protonmail.com&owner=Common%20Community)\nMay 18 2020, this domain is hosted on a probable dedicated server at OVH IP\n[137.74.157[.]84.](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/address.xhtml?address=137.74.157.84&owner=Common%20Community)\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile not definitive in terms of attribution, it s worth noting that some APT33 related\n[infrastructure like times-sync[.]com has previously used the same name server and OVH IP](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/host.xhtml?host=times-sync.com&owner=Common%20Community)\nspace for hosting. For example, the 137.74.157[.]84 IP was identified in a December 2019\nTrend Micro report on APT33 obfuscated botnets. Previously identified infrastructure was\n[documented in 20200106A: Suspicious Realhosters Name Server Domains.](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/incident/incident.xhtml?incident=2928984041&owner=Common%20Community#/)\n\nWe don’t have any information on the extent to which, if any, this domain has been used\nmaliciously. However, given the minimal use of the ns1.realhosters.com name server and\nAPT33’s potential reuse of it, any domains using it merit scrutiny as possible APT33\ndomains.\n\n_Update 5/21/20: The taskreminder[.]net domain is now hosted on a probable dedicated_\n_server at OVH IP_ _[91.134.187[.]25. To receive ThreatConnect notifications about updates to](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/address.xhtml?address=91.134.187.25&owner=Common%20Community)_\n_Host DNS changes, remember to check the “Follow Item” box on that item’s Details page._\n\n\n-----\n\n**ThreatConnect Research Team Intelligence:**\n\nThese are items recently created or updated in the ThreatConnect Common Community by\nour Research Team. They include threat actor profiles, malware families, campaigns,\nsignatures, and incidents based on our research and threat hunting activities. This week, we\nhighlight new infrastructure registered using previously observed APT33 techniques,\nsuspicious domains spoofing Poste Italiane, and an update to previously reported domains\nusing “msupdate” strings.\n\n[20200514A: Poste Italiane Spoofed Domains Registered through Reg[.]ru](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/incident/incident.xhtml?incident=3220699501#/)\nThreatConnect Research identified a series of domains spoofing Poste Italiane that\nhave been registered through Reg.ru since late April 2020 and are hosted on probable\ndedicated servers. While we have not identified activity leveraging these domains,\ngiven the domain name strings, they probably have been used in credential harvesting\nefforts.\n[20200511A: Suspicious “msupdate” Domains Registered Through Njalla](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/incident/incident.xhtml?incident=3211505936#/)\nThreatConnect Research identified three “msupdate” themed domains that were\nregistered at essentially the same time through Njalla on May 9 2020. As of May 11\n2020, the domains have not been hosted. The identified domains include the following:\n\n[afr-msupdate.com](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/host.xhtml?host=afr-msupdate.com&owner=Common%20Community)\n[asia-msupdate.com](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/host.xhtml?host=asia-msupdate.com&owner=Common%20Community)\n[de-msupdate.com](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/host.xhtml?host=de-msupdate.com&owner=Common%20Community)\n\n_Update_ _5/13/20: The aforementioned domains are now hosted on a probable dedicated_\n_server at OVH IP_ _[158.69.30.194. Additionally, the domains are also now using their own](https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/address.xhtml?address=158.69.30.194&owner=Common%20Community)_\n_name servers._\n\n\n-----\n\n**Technical Blogs and Reports Incidents with Active and Observed Indicators:**\n\nThe ThreatConnect Technical Blogs and Reports Source is a curated collection of open\nsource blogs and reports that are automatically aggregated and parsed for Indicators on a\ndaily basis.
