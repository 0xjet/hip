Familiarity with Wireshark is necessary to understand](https://www.wireshark.org/)\nthis tutorial, which focuses on Wireshark version 3.x.\n\n[Emotet is an information-stealer first reported in 2014 as banking malware. It has since](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.emotet)\nevolved with additional functions such as a dropper, distributing other malware families like\n[Gootkit,](https://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/Emotet+infections+and+followup+malware/24532/) [IcedID,](https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/2019/01/18/index.html) [Qakbot and](https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/2020/08/10/index.html) [Trickbot.](https://twitter.com/Unit42_Intel/status/1320847745155059712)\n\n\n-----\n\nToday s Wireshark tutorial reviews recent Emotet activity and provides some helpful tips on\nidentifying this malware based on traffic analysis.\n\nNote: These instructions assume you have customized Wireshark as described in our\nprevious Wireshark tutorial about customizing the column display.\n\nYou will need to access a GitHub repository with ZIP archives containing the pcaps used for\nthis tutorial.\n\n**Warning: Some of the pcaps used for this tutorial contain Windows-based malware. There is**\na risk of infection if using a Windows computer. If possible, we recommend you review these\npcaps in a non-Windows environment like BSD, Linux or macOS.\n\n## Chain of Events for an Emotet Infection\n\nTo understand network traffic caused by Emotet, you must first understand the chain of\nevents leading to an infection. Emotet is commonly distributed through malicious spam\n(malspam) emails. The critical step in an Emotet infection chain is a Microsoft Word\ndocument with macros designed to infect a vulnerable Windows host.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. Screenshot of a Word document used to cause an Emotet infection in January\n2021.\nMalspam spreading Emotet uses different techniques to distribute these Word documents.\n\nThe malspam may contain an attached Microsoft Word document or have an attached ZIP\narchive containing the Word document. In recent months, we have seen several examples\nwhere these ZIP archives are password-protected. Some emails distributing Emotet do not\nhave any attachments. Instead, they contain a link to download the Word document.\n\nIn previous years, malspam pushing Emotet has also used PDF attachments with embedded\nlinks to deliver these Emotet Word documents.\n\nFigure 2 illustrates these four distribution techniques.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2. Various distribution paths for an Emotet Word document.\nAfter the Word document is delivered, if a victim opens the document and enables macros\non a vulnerable Windows host, the host is infected with Emotet.\n\nFrom a traffic perspective, we see the following steps from an Emotet Word document to an\nEmotet infection:\n\nWeb traffic to retrieve the initial binary.\nEncoded/encrypted command and control (C2) traffic over HTTP.\nAdditional infection traffic if Emotet drops follow-up malware.\nSMTP traffic if Emotet uses the infected host as a spambot.\n\nFigure 3 shows a flowchart of network activity we might find during an Emotet infection.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3. Flowchart for an Emotet infection.\nSince Dec. 21, 2020, the initial binary for Emotet has been a Windows DLL file. Previously,\nthis binary had been a Windows EXE file.\n\nEmotet C2 traffic consists of encoded or otherwise encrypted data sent over HTTP. This C2\nactivity can use either standard or non-standard TCP ports associated with HTTP traffic. This\nC2 activity also consists of data exfiltration and traffic to update the initial Emotet binary.\n\nSince Emotet is also a malware dropper, the victim may become infected with other malware.\nAnalysts should search for traffic from other malware when investigating traffic from an\nEmotet-infected host.\n\nFinally, an Emotet-infected host may also become a spambot generating large amounts of\ntraffic over TCP ports associated with SMTP like TCP ports 25, 465 and 587.\n\n## Pcaps of Emotet Infection Activity\n\nFive password-protected ZIP archives containing pcaps of recent Emotet infection traffic are\n[available at this GitHub repository. Once on the GitHub page, click on each of the ZIP](https://github.com/pan-unit42/wireshark-tutorial-Emotet-traffic)\narchive entries and download them, as shown in Figures 4 and 5.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4. GitHub repository with links to ZIP archives used for this tutorial.\n\nFigure 5. Downloading one of the ZIP archives for this tutorial.\nUse infected as the password to extract pcaps from these ZIP archives. This should give\nyou the following five pcap files:\n\n\n-----\n\nExample-1-2021-01-06-Emotet-infection.pcap\nExample-2-2021-01-05-Emotet-with-spambot-traffic-part-1.pcap\nExample-3-2021-01-05-Emotet-with-spambot-traffic-part-2.pcap\nExample-4-2021-01-05-Emotet-infection-with-Trickbot.pcap\nExample-5-2020-08-18-Emotet-infection-with-Qakbot.pcap\n\n## Example 1: Emotet Infection Traffic\n\nOpen Example-1-2021-01-06-Emotet-infection.pcap in Wireshark and use a basic web\n[filter as described in our previous tutorial about Wireshark filters. The basic filter for](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/using-wireshark-display-filter-expressions/)\nWireshark 3.x is:\n\n(http.request or tls.handshake.type eq 1) and !(ssdp)\n\nIf you’ve set up Wireshark according to our initial tutorial about customizing Wireshark\ndisplays, your display should look similar to Figure 6.\n\nFigure 6. Our first pcap in this tutorial filtered in Wireshark.\nAs shown in Figure 6, the first five HTTP GET requests represent four URLs used to retrieve\nthe initial Emotet DLL. The traffic is:\n\nhangarlastik[.]com GET /cgi-bin/Ui4n/\nhangarlastik[.]com GET /cgi-sys/suspendedpage.cgi\npadreescapes[.]com GET /blog/0I/\n\n\n-----\n\nsarture[.]com GET /wp-includes/JD8/\nseo.udaipurkart[.]com GET /rx-5700-6hnr7/Sgms/\n\nThe first two URLs indicate hangarlastik[.]com no longer had the Emotet DLL file it had been\nhosting. Follow TCP streams for each of these requests to see replies to each of the HTTP\nGET requests.\n\nAn easier way to see the HTTP responses is to update your Wireshark basic web filter to\ninclude HTTP responses:\n\n(http.request or http.response or tls.handshake.type eq 1) and !(ssdp)\n\nThis will show HTTP responses in the Info column, as illustrated in Figure 7.\n\nFigure 7. Adding HTTP responses to the Wireshark display filter.\nNow we have a clearer picture of what happened when the Word macro tried to retrieve an\nEmotet DLL:\n\nhangarlastik[.]com GET /cgi-bin/Ui4n/\nHTTP/1.1 302 Found\nhangarlastik[.]com GET /cgi-sys/suspendedpage.cgi\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\npadreescapes[.]com GET /blog/0I/\nHTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized\nsarture[.]com GET /wp-includes/JD8/\nHTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden\nseo.udaipurkart[.]com GET /rx-5700-6hnr7/Sgms/\n\nThe only 200 OK was a reply for a suspended page notification from hangarlastik[.]com.\n\nThe HTTP GET request to seo.udaipurkart[.]com does not show a response, so follow the\nTCP stream for this request, as shown in Figure 8.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8. Following TCP stream for the HTTP request to seo.udaipurkart[.]com.\n\nThe TCP stream shows indicators that seo.udaipurkart[.]com returned a Windows DLL file,\nas shown in Figure 9.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 9. Indicators of a DLL file returned from seo.udaipurkart[.]com.Export this DLL from\nthe pcap by using the menu path: File --> Export Objects --> HTTP, as shown in Figure 10.\nAs always, we recommend you do not export this file in a Windows environment, since the\nDLL is Windows-based malware.\n\nFigure 10. Exporting the Emotet DLL from our first pcap.\nThe SHA256 hash for this extracted DLL is:\n\n\n-----\n\n8e37a82ff94c03a5be3f9dd76b9dfc335a0f70efc0d8fd3dca9ca34dd287de1b\n\nEmotet C2 traffic is encoded data sent using HTTP POST requests. You can easily find\nthese requests in Wireshark using the following filter:\n\nhttp.request.method eq POST\n\nThe results are shown in Figure 11.\n\nFigure 11. Filtering for HTTP POST requests in our first pcap.\nIn our first pcap, Emotet C2 traffic consists of HTTP POST requests to:\n\n5.2.136[.]90 over TCP port 80\n167.71.4[.]0 over TCP port 8080\n\nEmotet generates two types of HTTP POST requests for its C2 traffic. The first type of POST\nrequest ends with HTTP/1.1. The second type of POST request ends with HTTP/1.1\n(application/x-www-form-urlencoded).\n\nFollow the TCP stream for the initial HTTP request to 5.2.136[.]90 at 16:42:34 UTC to see an\nexample of the first type of C2 POST request, as shown in Figure 12.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 12. The first type of HTTP POST request for Emotet C2 traffic.\nFigure 12 shows this POST request sends approximately 6 KB of form-data that appears to\nbe an encoded or encrypted binary. Scroll down to the HTTP response to see encoded data\nreturned from the server. Figure 13 shows the start of this encoded data.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 13. Encoded data returned from the server in response to the HTTP POST request.\nThis type of encoded or encrypted data is how Emotet botnet servers exchange data with an\ninfected Windows host. This is also the channel Emotet uses to update the Emotet DLL and\ndrop follow-up malware.\n\nThe second type of HTTP POST request for Emotet C2 traffic looks noticeably different than\nthe first type. Use the following filter in Wireshark to easily find the second type of HTTP\nPOST request:\n\nurlencoded-form\n\nThis should return two HTTP POST requests to 167.71.4[.]0 over TCP port 8080, as shown\nin Figure 14.\n\nFigure 14. Filtering for the second type of HTTP POST request in Emotet C2 traffic.\nFollow the TCP stream for the first of these two HTTP POST requests at 16:58:43 UTC.\nReview the traffic. The results are shown in Figure 15.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 15. TCP stream for the second type of HTTP POST request in Emotet C2 traffic.\nAs shown in Figure 15, some of the data sent in the POST request is encoded as a base64\nstring with some URL encoding. For example, %2B is used for a + symbol, %2F represents /\nand %3D is used for =.\n\nData sent in response from the server is encoded or otherwise encrypted.\n\nOur first pcap has no follow-up malware or other significant activity.\n\nThe only other activity is repeated connection attempts to 46.101.230[.]194 over TCP port\n443. You can easily spot this activity by filtering on TCP SYN segments that are\nretransmissions. Use the following Wireshark filter:\n\ntcp.analysis.retransmission and tcp.flags eq 0x0002\n\nThe results are shown in Figure 16.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 16. Filtering on retransmissions of TCP SYN segments in Wireshark.\nAn Internet search on 46.101.230[.]194 should reveal this IP address has been used for\nEmotet C2 activity.\n\nThe remaining traffic in the pcap is system traffic generated by a Microsoft Windows 10 host.\n\nIn our next pcap, we examine an Emotet infection with spambot activity.\n\n## Example 2: Emotet With Spambot Traffic, Part 1\n\nOpen Example-2-2021-01-05-Emotet-with-spambot-traffic-part-1.pcap in Wireshark and\nuse a basic web filter, as shown in Figure 17.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 17. Traffic from the second pcap filtered in Wireshark using our basic web filter.\nSimilar to our first example, we receive some HTTP GET requests before Emotet C2 traffic.\nThese GET requests are attempts to download the initial Emotet DLL over web traffic. The\nfirst frame in the column display shows HTTPS traffic to obob[.]tv, which was probably a web\nrequest for the initial Emotet DLL, because this domain was reported as hosting an Emotet\nbinary on Jan. 5, 2021, the same date as the traffic in our pcap.\n\nFollow the TCP stream for the HTTP GET request to miprimercamino[.]com to confirm it\nreturned an Emotet DLL. You should see indicators similar to Figure 9 from our first pcap.\nWe can export the Emotet DLL returned from miprimercamino[.]com, as shown in Figure 18.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 18. Exporting the Emotet DLL from the pcap.\nThe SHA256 hash for the extracted DLL from our second pcap is:\n\n963b00584d8d63ea84585f7457e6ddcac9eda54428a432f388a1ffee21137316\n\nAgain, we find two types of HTTP POST requests for Emotet C2 traffic. To filter for each type\nof Emotet C2 HTTP POST request, use the following Wireshark filters:\n\nFirst type: http.request method eq POST and !(urlencoded-form)\nSecond type: urlencoded-form\n\nFollow TCP streams for the HTTP POST requests returned by these filters and confirm they\nfollow the same patterns seen in our first pcap.\n\nAfter reviewing some examples of Emotet C2 traffic from this pcap, let’s move on to the\nspambot activity.\n\nIn this example, our infected host was turned into a spambot, so we also have SMTP traffic.\nThe spambot SMTP traffic is encrypted, but we can easily find it by using our basic web filter\nand scrolling down the column display.\n\nAt 20:06:20 UTC, the pcap starts showing SSL/TLS traffic to TCP ports associated with the\nSMTP email protocol, like TCP ports 25, 465 and 587, as shown in Figure 19.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 19. Using the basic web filter and scrolling through the column display to find spambot\ntraffic.\nWe can filter on smtp to find some of the SMTP commands before encrypted SMTP tunnels\nare established. Figure 20 shows the results.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 20. Filtering for SMTP traffic in our second pcap.\nWe can sometimes find unencrypted SMTP from spambot traffic generated by an Emotetinfected Windows host. Unencrypted SMTP will reveal its message content, but the volume\nof encrypted SMTP from a spambot host is far greater than the volume of unencrypted\nSMTP. Therefore, most of the spambot messages from an Emotet-infected host are hidden\nwithin the encrypted traffic.\n\nIn this example, you should only see encrypted SMTP traffic.\n\nBut our next example is later from this same infection, when we finally saw some\nunencrypted SMTP.\n\n## Example 3: Emotet With Spambot Traffic, Part 2\n\nOpen Example-3-2021-01-05-Emotet-with-spambot-traffic-part-2.pcap in Wireshark and\nuse a basic web filter, as shown in Figure 21.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 21. Traffic from the third pcap filtered in Wireshark using our basic web filter.\nIn this pcap, we still see HTTP POST requests for Emotet C2 traffic, at least twice each\nminute. We can also find encrypted spambot activity similar to our previous pcap.\n\nSpambot activity frequently generates a large amount of traffic. This pcap consists of 4\nminutes and 42 seconds of spambot activity from the infected Windows host, and it’s over 21\nMB of traffic.\n\nWe can quickly identify any unencrypted SMTP traffic by using the following Wireshark filter:\n\nsmtp.data.fragment\n\nFigure 22 shows the results of this filter for our third pcap. The filter reveals five examples of\nEmotet malspam generated by the infected Windows host.\n\nFigure 22. Filtering for indicators of unencrypted SMTP from spambot traffic.\n\n\n-----\n\nFollow the TCP stream for the last email from: Gladisbel Miranda at 20:19:54 UTC. Examine\nwhat these messages look like, as shown in Figure 23.\n\nFigure 23. TCP stream for an example of Emotet malspam from our third pcap.\nWe can export these five items of Emotet malspam by using the menu path File --> Export\n**_Objects --> IMF, as shown in Figure 24._**\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 24. Exporting Emotet malspam from our third pcap.\nExport these emails and examine them. Ideally, we recommend doing this in a non-Windows\n[environment. Thunderbird is a free email client you can use to see how a potential victim](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/)\nmight view these emails.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Emotet is also a malware downloader. Perhaps the most common\nmalware distributed through Emotet is Trickbot.\n\n## Example 4: Emotet Infection with Trickbot\n\nOpen Example-4-2021-01-05-Emotet-infection-with-Trickbot.pcap in Wireshark and use a\nbasic web filter, as shown in Figure 25.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 25. Traffic from the fourth pcap filtered in Wireshark using our basic web filter.\nThis pcap does not have an HTTP GET request for an initial Emotet DLL. However, the first\nframe in our column display shows HTTPS traffic to fathekarim[.]com. This was probably a\nweb request for the Emotet DLL, because this domain was reported as hosting an Emotet\nbinary on Jan. 5, 2021, the same date as the traffic in our pcap.\n\nYou should find the same two types of HTTP POST requests associated with Emotet C2, as\ndescribed in our previous two pcaps.\n\nThis pcap also contains indicators of a Trickbot infection. Use your basic web filter and scroll\ndown to find Trickbot traffic, as shown in Figure 26.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 26. Scrolling down the column display to find Trickbot indicators in our fourth pcap\nusing a basic web filter.\n[We’ve reviewed Trickbot in our previous Wireshark tutorial on examining Trickbot infections,](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wireshark-tutorial-examining-trickbot-infections/)\nbut here is a quick refresher. The following are common indicators for Trickbot:\n\nHTTPS traffic over TCP ports 447 or 449 without an associated domain or hostname.\nHTTP POST requests over standard or non-standard TCP ports for HTTP traffic that\nend with /81/, /83/ or /90, which are associated with data exfiltration.\nWith Trickbot from Emotet infections, the above HTTP POST requests start with /mor\nfollowed by a number (only one or two digits seen so far).\nHTTP GET requests for URLs that end in .png that return additional Trickbot binaries.\n\nWe can easily find these indicators using the following Wireshark filters:\n\ntls.handshake.type eq 1 and (tcp.port eq 447 or tcp.port eq 449)\n(http.request.uri contains /81 or http.request.uri contains /83 or http.request.uri contains\n/90) and http.request.uri contains mor\nhttp.request.uri contains .png\n\nFigures 27-29 show the results from each of the above filters.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 27.: Filtering for Trickbot HTTPS traffic over TCP port 447 or TCP port 449.\n\nFigure 28. Filtering for HTTP POST requests associated with Trickbot data exfiltration.\nFollow TCP streams for each of the HTTP POST requests shown in Figure 28 to see if any\npassword data was exfiltrated. The last HTTP POST request ending with /90 contains data\nabout the infected Windows host and its environment.\n\nFigure 29. Filtering for HTTP GET requests ending in .png associated with additional Trickbot\nbinaries.\n\n\n-----\n\nFollow TCP streams for each of the HTTP POST requests shown in Figure 29 to see if any\nWindows binaries were returned. Doing so should reveal two Windows executable files. You\ncan then export these binaries from the pcap using File --> Export Objects --> HTTP, as\ndiscussed in our previous examples.\n\nSHA256 hashes for these two Windows binaries (both EXE files) are:\n\n59e1711d6e4323da2dc22cdee30ba8876def991f6e476f29a0d3f983368ab461 for\nmingup.png\ned8dea5381a7f6c78108a04344dc73d5669690b7ecfe6e44b2c61687a2306785 for\nsaved.png\n\nTrickbot is the most common malware distributed by Emotet, but it is not the only one.\nQakbot is another type of malware frequently dropped on Emotet-infected Windows hosts.\n\n## Example 5: Emotet Infection With Qakbot\n\nOpen Example-5-2020-08-18-Emotet-infection-with-Qakbot.pcap in Wireshark and use a\nbasic web filter, as shown in Figure 30.\n\nFigure 30. Traffic from the fifth pcap filtered in Wireshark using our basic web filter.\nIn our fifth pcap, an Emotet Word document was retrieved from\nsaketpranamam.mysquare[.]in at 21:23:50 UTC, which matches a URL reported as hosting\nan Emotet Word document on the same date. Export this Word document from the pcap\n\n\n-----\n\nusing File --> Export Objects --> HTTP, as discussed in our previous examples.\n\nThe SHA256 hash for this extracted Word document is:\n\nc7f429dde8986a1b2fc51a9b3f4a78a92311677a01790682120ab603fd3c2fcb\n\nWe also see HTTPS traffic to samaritantec[.]com at 21:24:40 UTC. This domain was\nreported as hosting an Emotet binary on the same date.\n\nAs in our previous examples, you should find the same two types of HTTP POST requests\nassociated with Emotet C2 traffic.\n\nAdditionally, this pcap contains indicators of a Qakbot infection. Use your basic web filter and\nscroll down to find Qakbot traffic, as shown in Figure 31.\n\nFigure 31. Scrolling down the column display to find Qakbot indicators in our fifth pcap using\na basic web filter.\n[We’ve reviewed Qakbot in our previous Wireshark tutorial on examining Qakbot infections,](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/tutorial-qakbot-infection/)\nbut here is a quick refresher. The following are common indicators for Qakbot:\n\nHTTPS traffic over standard and non-standard TCP ports for HTTPS.\nCertificate data for Qakbot HTTPS traffic has unusual values for the issuer fields, and\nthe certificate is not issued by an authority based in the United States.\nTCP traffic over TCP port 65400.\n\n\n-----\n\nPrior to late November 2020, Qakbot commonly generated HTTPS traffic to\ncdn.speedof[.]me.\nPrior to late November 2020, Qakbot commonly generated HTTP GET requests to\na.strandsglobal[.]com.\n\nWe can easily find these indicators by using the following Wireshark filters:\n\ntls.handshake.type eq 11 and !(x509sat.CountryName == US)\ntcp.port eq 65400\ntls.handshake.extensions_server_name contains speedof\nhttp.host contains strandsglobal\n\nFigures 32-35 show the results from each of the above filters.\n\nFigure 32. Filtering and searching for unusual certificate issuer data in HTTPS traffic\ngenerated by Qakbot.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn Figure 32, the results of our first filter show several frames in the column display for traffic\nfrom 71.80.66[.]107. Search through the frame details and find unusual certificate issuer\ndata, as shown above.\n\nFigure 33. Filtering for Qakbot traffic over TCP port 65400.\nIn the above image, we find a single TCP stream of Qakbot traffic over TCP port 65400. This\nstream contains the public IP address and a botnet identification string for the Qakbotinfected Windows host.\n\nFigure 34. Filtering for traffic to cdn.speedof[.]me, which is not inherently malicious, but a\nconnectivity check caused by Qakbot prior to late November 2020.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 35. Filtering for traffic to a.stransglobal[.]com, typically generated by Qakbot prior to\nlate November 2020.While Emotet has commonly dropped Trickbot and Qakbot, be aware\nthat Emotet has also dropped other types of malware such as Gootkit and IcedID.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis tutorial reviewed how to identify Emotet activity from pcaps of its infection traffic. We\nreviewed five recent pcaps and found similarities in HTTP POST requests caused by Emotet\nC2 traffic. The patterns are fairly unique and can be used to identify an Emotet infection\nwithin your network. We also reviewed other post-infection activities associated with Emotet,\nsuch as spambot traffic and different families of malware dropped on an infected host.\n\nThis knowledge can help security professionals better detect and catch an Emotet infection\nwhen reviewing suspicious network activity.\n\nFor more help with Wireshark, see our previous tutorials:\n\n**Get updates from**\n\n**Palo Alto**\n\n**Networks!**\n\nSign up to receive the latest news, cyber threat intelligence and research from us\n\n[By submitting this form, you agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge our Privacy](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/legal-notices/terms-of-use)\nStatement.\n\n\n-----",
