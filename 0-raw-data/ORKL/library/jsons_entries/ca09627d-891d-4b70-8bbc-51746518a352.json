To date, the cumulative volume of coronavirus-related email lures now represents\nthe greatest collection of attack types united by a single theme that our team has seen in\nyears, if not ever. We’ve observed credential phishing, malicious attachments, malicious\nlinks, [business email compromise (BEC), fake landing pages, downloaders, spam, and](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/products/email-protection/email-fraud-defense)\n[malware, among others, all leveraging coronavirus lures.](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-reference/malware)\n\nOver the past week, the team observed a campaign from TA505, the group behind Locky\nransomware and the Dridex banking Trojan, that uses a coronavirus lure as part of a\ndownloader campaign targeting the U.S. healthcare, manufacturing, and pharmaceuticals\nindustries.\n\nThe team also found a separate coronavirus-themed campaign that uses a downloader,\ntargets the healthcare industry, and demands Bitcoin payment. Indicating a potential future\nshift in the attack landscape, the downloaders used in the above two campaigns are\nsometimes seen as a first stage payload before ransomware is later downloaded and\ninstalled on a victim’s machine. [Ransomware is typically delivered as either second or later](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-reference/ransomware)\nstage payload.\n\nWe’ve additionally seen TA564 using coronavirus emails to target Canadian users by\nspoofing the Public Health Agency of Canada in an attempt to deliver Ursnif.\n\n## New TA505 Malware and Campaign Examples\n\nAs everyone around the world continues to search online for the latest developments and\nnews around coronavirus, Proofpoint researchers have observed TA505, the group behind\nthe Locky ransomware, using a coronavirus lure in an attempt to deliver a downloader to a\nvictim’s computer. Once delivered, attackers can then download additional types of malware\nincluding banking Trojans and ransomware. TA505 is known as one of the most significant\nfinancially motivated threat actors due to the extraordinary volumes of messages they send.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure one below shows an email from one of the attempted TA505 Coronavirus attacks\npurporting to contain information to help protect users’ friends from the virus, urging readers\nto click the link provided.\n\n_Figure 1 TA505 Coronavirus FAQ Lure_\n\nWe have also separately seen coronavirus-themed emails with downloaders targeting\nhealthcare organizations that request Bitcoin payments. Figure 2 below shows an email\noffering coronavirus remedies in exchange for Bitcoin.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2 Coronavirus Campaign Requesting Bitcoin for Remedy_\n\nWe’ve also seen TA564 using coronavirus emails targeting Canadian users by spoofing the\nPublic Health Agency of Canada in an attempt to deliver Ursnif. Ursnif is a common banking\nTrojan that can steal stored data, including passwords, from banking websites via web\ninjections, proxies, and VNC connections.\n\nFigure 3 below shows an email addressing “parents and guardians,” with a reported update\nfrom the Public Health Agency of Canada’s Medical Officer of Health, listing the individual’s\ncorrect name.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3 Fake Public Health Agency of Canada Lure_\n\n**Summary of TA505 Coronavirus Attacks**\n\nWe anticipate TA505 malware attackers will continue to leverage COVID-19 (as detailed in\nour new Redline Stealer Threat Insight blog) as it develops further worldwide and will also\nlikely pursue potential targets who are now being asked to work from home. Stay vigilant for\nmalicious emails regarding remote access and fake corporate websites, all aimed at\nensnaring teleworkers. When working remotely, be sure to use a secure Wi-Fi connection,\nprotect your VPN log-in, use strong passwords, think twice about clicking on links, and\nconfirm all transactions are authentic.\n\nWe’ll continue posting future TA505 attack news as well as coronavirus campaigns and\ninsights on our threat research Twitter account: [https://twitter.com/threatinsight. You can also](https://twitter.com/threatinsight)\n[review additional coronavirus-themed campaign examples on conspiracy theories and](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/corporate-blog/post/attackers-expand-coronavirus-themed-attacks-and-prey-conspiracy-theories) global\nshipping concerns in our previous posts.\n\nSubscribe to the Proofpoint Blog\n\n\n-----",
