    "plain_text": "# Exposing POLONIUM activity and infrastructure targeting Israeli organizations\n\n**[microsoft.com/security/blog/2022/06/02/exposing-polonium-activity-and-infrastructure-targeting-israeli-organizations/](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2022/06/02/exposing-polonium-activity-and-infrastructure-targeting-israeli-organizations/)**\n\nJune 2, 2022\n\nMicrosoft successfully detected and disabled attack activity abusing OneDrive by a\npreviously undocumented Lebanon-based activity group Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center\n(MSTIC) tracks as POLONIUM. The associated indicators and tactics were used by the\nOneDrive team to improve detection of attack activity and disable offending actor accounts.\nTo further address this abuse, Microsoft has suspended more than 20 malicious OneDrive\napplications created by POLONIUM actors, notified affected organizations, and deployed a\nseries of security intelligence updates that will quarantine tools developed by POLONIUM\noperators. Our goal with this blog is to help deter future activity by exposing and sharing the\nPOLONIUM tactics with the community at large.\n\nMSTIC assesses with high confidence that POLONIUM represents an operational group\nbased in Lebanon. We also assess with moderate confidence that the observed activity was\ncoordinated with other actors affiliated with Iran’s Ministry of Intelligence and Security\n(MOIS), based primarily on victim overlap and commonality of tools and techniques. Such\n\n\n-----\n\ncollaboration or direction from Tehran would align with a string of revelations since late 2020\nthat the Government of Iran is using third parties to carry out cyber operations on their\nbehalf, likely to enhance Iran’s plausible deniability.\n\nPOLONIUM has targeted or compromised more than 20 organizations based in Israel and\none intergovernmental organization with operations in Lebanon over the past three months.\nThis actor has deployed unique tools that abuse legitimate cloud services for command and\ncontrol (C2) across most of their victims. POLONIUM was observed creating and using\nlegitimate OneDrive accounts, then utilizing those accounts as C2 to execute part of their\nattack operation. This activity does not represent any security issues or vulnerabilities on the\nOneDrive platform. In addition, MSTIC does not, at present, see any links between this\nactivity and other publicly documented groups linked to Lebanon like Volatile Cedar. This\nblog will also expose further details that show Iranian threat actors may be collaborating with\nproxies to operationalize their attacks. Microsoft continues to work across its platforms to\nidentify abuse, take down malicious activity, and implement new proactive protections to\ndiscourage malicious actors from using our services.\n\nAs with any observed nation-state actor activity, Microsoft directly notifies customers that\nhave been targeted or compromised, providing them with the information they need to\nsecure their accounts.\n\n## Observed actor activity\n\nSince February 2022, POLONIUM has been observed primarily targeting organizations in\nIsrael with a focus on critical manufacturing, IT, and Israel’s defense industry. In at least one\ncase, POLONIUM’s compromise of an IT company was used to target a downstream aviation\ncompany and law firm in a supply chain attack that relied on service provider credentials to\ngain access to the targeted networks. Multiple manufacturing companies they targeted also\nserve Israel’s defense industry, indicating a POLONIUM tactic that follows an increasing\ntrend by many actors, including among several Iranian groups, of targeting service provider\naccess to gain downstream access. Observed victim organizations were in the following\nsectors: critical manufacturing, information technology, transportation systems, defense\nindustrial base, government agencies and services, food and agriculture, financial services,\nhealthcare and public health, and other business types.\n\n### POLONIUM TTPs shared with Iran-based nation-state actors\n\nMSTIC assesses with moderate confidence that POLONIUM is coordinating its operations\nwith multiple tracked actor groups affiliated with Iran’s Ministry of Intelligence and Security\n(MOIS), based on victim overlap and the following common techniques and tooling:\n\n\n-----\n\n**Common unique victim targeting: MSTIC has observed POLONIUM active on or**\ntargeting multiple victims that MERCURY previously compromised. According to the\n[US Cyber Command, MuddyWater, a group we track as MERCURY, “is a subordinate](https://www.cybercom.mil/Media/News/Article/2897570/iranian-intel-cyber-suite-of-malware-uses-open-source-tools/)\nelement within the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence and Security.”\n**Evidence of possible “hand-off” operations: The uniqueness of the victim**\norganizations suggests a convergence of mission requirements with MOIS. It may also\nbe evidence of a ‘hand-off’ operational model where MOIS provides POLONIUM with\naccess to previously compromised victim environments to execute new activity. MSTIC\ncontinues to monitor both actors to further verify this ‘hand-off’ hypothesis.\n**Use of OneDrive for C2: MSTIC has observed both POLONIUM and DEV-0133 (aka**\n[Lyceum) using cloud services, including OneDrive, for data exfiltration and command](https://www.secureworks.com/blog/lyceum-takes-center-stage-in-middle-east-campaign)\nand control.\n**Use of AirVPN: Both POLONIUM and DEV-0588 (aka CopyKittens) commonly use**\nAirVPN for operational activity. While use of public VPN services is common across\nmany actor sets, these actors’ specific choice to use AirVPN, combined with the\nadditional overlaps documented above, further supports the moderate confidence\nassessment that POLONIUM collaborates with MOIS.\n\n### Abuse of cloud services\n\nPOLONIUM has been observed deploying a series of custom implants that utilize cloud\nservices for command and control as well as data exfiltration. MSTIC has observed implants\nconnecting to POLONIUM-owned accounts in OneDrive and Dropbox. These tools are\ndetected as the following malware:\n\nTrojan:PowerShell/CreepyDrive.A!dha\nTrojan:PowerShell/CreepyDrive.B!dha\nTrojan:PowerShell/CreepyDrive.C!dha\nTrojan:PowerShell/CreepyDrive.D!dha\nTrojan:PowerShell/CreepyDrive.E!dha\nTrojan:MSIL/CreepyBox.A!dha\nTrojan:MSIL/CreepyBox.B!dha\nTrojan:MSIL/CreepyBox.C!dha\n\nWhile OneDrive performs antivirus scanning on all uploaded content, POLONIUM is not\nusing the cloud service to host their malware. If malware was hosted in the OneDrive\naccount, Microsoft Defender Antivirus detections would block it. Instead, they are interacting\nwith the cloud service in the same way that a legitimate customer would. OneDrive is\npartnering with MSTIC to identify and disable accounts that are linked to known adversary\nbehavior.\n\n### CreepyDrive analysis\n\n\n-----\n\nThe CreepyDrive implant utilizes a POLONIUM-owned OneDrive storage account for\ncommand and control. The implant provides basic functionality of allowing the threat actor to\nupload stolen files and download files to run.\n\nAll web requests by the CreepyDrive implant use the Invoke-WebRequest cmdlet. The\nimplant’s logic is wrapped in a while true loop, ensuring continuous execution of the implant\nonce running. The implant contains no native persistence mechanism; if terminated it would\nneed to be re-executed by the threat actor.\n\nDue to the lack of victim identifiers in the CreepyDrive implant, using the same OneDrive\naccount for multiple victims, while possible, may be challenging. It’s likely that a different\nthreat actor-controlled OneDrive account is used per implant.\n\n**Getting an OAuth token**\n\nWhen run, the implant first needs to authenticate with OneDrive. The threat actor\nincorporated a refresh token within the implant. Refresh tokens are part of the Open\nAuthorization 2 (OAuth) specification, allowing a new OAuth token to be issued when it\nexpires. There are several mechanisms that make token theft difficult, including the use of\nthe trusted platform module (TPM) to protect secrets. More information on these\n[mechanisms can be found here.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/devices/concept-primary-refresh-token)\n\nIn this instance, the protection settings tied to the OneDrive account are fully controlled by\nthe threat actor, allowing them to disable protections that prevent the theft of the token and\nclient secrets. As the threat actor is in full control of all secrets and key material associated\nwith the account, their sign-in activity looks like legitimate customer behavior and is thus\nchallenging to detect.\n\nThis token and client secret are transmitted in the body of request to a legitimate Microsoft\nendpoint to generate an OAuth token:\n```\nhttps[://]login.microsoftonline.com/consumers/oauth2/v2.0/token\n\n```\nThis request provides the requisite OAuth token for the implant to interact with the threat\nactor-owned OneDrive account. Using this OAuth token, the implant makes a request to the\nfollowing Microsoft Graph API endpoint to access the file data.txt:\n```\nhttps[://]graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/drive/root:/Documents/data.txt:/content\n\n```\nThe file data.txt acts as the primary tasking mechanism for the implant, providing three\nbranches of execution.\n\n**Upload**\n\nThe first branch is triggered when the word “upload” is provided in the response. This\nresponse payload also contains two additional elements: a local file path to upload, and what\nis likely a threat actor-defined remote file name to upload the local file into. The request is\n\n\n-----\n\nstructured as follows:\n```\nhttps[://]graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/drive/root:/Uploaded/???:/content\n\n```\n**Download**\n\nThe second branch is triggered when the word “download” is provided in the response. This\nresponse payload contains a file name to download from the threat actor-owned OneDrive\naccount. The request is structured as follows:\n```\nhttps[://]graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/drive/root:/Downloaded/???:/content\n\n```\n**Execute**\n\nThis branch is triggered when no command is provided in the response. The response\npayload can contain either an array of commands to execute or file paths to files previously\ndownloaded by the implant. The threat actor can also provide a mixture of individual\ncommands and file paths.\n\nEach value from the array is passed individually into the below custom function, which uses\nthe Invoke-Expression cmdlet to run commands:\n\nThe output of each executed command is aggregated and then written back to the following\nlocation in the threat actor-owned OneDrive account:\n```\nhttps[://]graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/drive/root:/Documents/response.json:/content\n\n```\nDuring the execution of this mechanism, the threat actor resets the content of the original\ntasking file data.txt with the following request:\n```\nhttps[://]graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/drive/root:/Documents/data.txt:/content\n\n```\nFinally, the CreepyDrive implant sleeps, re-executing in a loop until the process is\nterminated.\n\n### Use of custom implant\n\n\n-----\n\nPOLONIUM has also been observed deploying a custom PowerShell implant detected as\nBackdoor:PowerShell/CreepySnail.B!dha. The C2s for observed CreepySnail implants\ninclude:\n\n135[.]125[.]147[.]170:80\n185[.]244[.]129[.]79:63047\n185[.]244[.]129[.]79:80\n45[.]80[.]149[.]108:63047\n45[.]80[.]149[.]108:80\n45[.]80[.]149[.]57:63047\n45[.]80[.]149[.]68:63047\n45[.]80[.]149[.]71:80\n\nThe code below demonstrates how the CreepySnail PowerShell implant, once deployed on a\ntarget network, attempts to authenticate using stolen credentials and connect to POLONIUM\nC2 for further actions on objectives, such as data exfiltration or further abuse as C2.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n### Use of commodity tools\n\nPOLONIUM has also been observed dropping a secondary payload via their OneDrive\nimplant. POLONIUM used a common SSH tool for automating interactive sign-ins called\n_plink to set up a redundant tunnel from the victim environment to the attacker-controlled_\ninfrastructure.\n\nThe observed C2 IP addresses for POLONIUM plink tunnels include:\n\n185[.]244[.]129 [.]109\n172[.]96[.]188[.]51\n\n\n-----\n\n51[.]83 [.]246 [.]73\n\n### Exploitation\n\nWhile we continue to pursue confirmation of how POLONIUM gained initial access to many\nof their victims, MSTIC notes that approximately 80% of the observed victims beaconing to\n_graph.microsoft.com were running Fortinet appliances. This suggests, but does not_\ndefinitively prove, that POLONIUM compromised these Fortinet devices by exploiting the\n[CVE-2018-13379 vulnerability to gain access to the compromised organizations.](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-13379)\n\n### IT supply chain attacks\n\nIn one case, POLONIUM compromised a cloud service provider based in Israel and likely\nused this access to compromise downstream customers of the service provider. Specifically,\nMSTIC observed that POLONIUM pivoted through the service provider and gained access to\na law firm and an aviation company in Israel. The tactic of leveraging IT products and service\nproviders to gain access to downstream customers remains a favorite of Iranian actors and\ntheir proxies.\n\nMicrosoft will continue to monitor ongoing activity from POLONIUM and the other Iranian\nMOIS-affiliated actors discussed in this blog and implement protections for our customers.\nThe current detections, advanced detections, and IOCs in place across our security products\nare detailed below.\n\n## Recommended customer actions\n\nThe techniques used by the actor described in the “Observed actor activity” section can be\nmitigated by adopting the security considerations provided below:\n\nUse the included indicators of compromise to investigate whether they exist in your\n[environment and assess for potential intrusion. Microsoft Sentinel queries are provided](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/microsoft-sentinel/#overview)\nin the advanced hunting section below.\nConfirm that Microsoft Defender Antivirus is updated to security intelligence update\n1.365.40.0 or later, or ensure that [cloud protection is turned on, to detect the related](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/cloud-protection-microsoft-defender-antivirus)\nindicators.\nBlock in-bound traffic from IPs specified in the “Indicators of compromise” table.\nReview all authentication activity for remote access infrastructure (VPNs), with a\nparticular focus on accounts configured with single factor authentication, to confirm\nauthenticity and investigate any anomalous activity.\nEnable multifactor authentication (MFA) to mitigate potentially compromised credentials\nand ensure that MFA is enforced for all remote connectivity. NOTE: Microsoft strongly\nencourages all customers download and use passwordless solutions like Microsoft\nAuthenticator to secure your accounts.\n\n\n-----\n\nFor customers that have relationships with service providers, review and audit partner\nrelationships to minimize any unnecessary permissions between your organization and\nupstream providers. Microsoft recommends immediately removing access for any\npartner relationships that look unfamiliar or have not yet been audited.\n\n## Indicators of compromise (IOCs)\n\nThe below list provides IOCs observed during our investigation.
