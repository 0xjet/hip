Andariel has a connection\nto the cyber-attack named Operation Black Mine that occurred in 2014 and 2015. However, Operation Black Mine\nis also associated with the attacks on the South Korean Military Agency in 2008 and the attacks against South\nKorean banks and broadcasters in 2013 (a.k.a DarkSeoul).\n\nThe major targets of the Andariel Group include not only military agencies, defense industries, political\norganizations, security companies, ICT companies, and energy research institutes, but also financial targets, such\nas ATMs, banks, travel agencies, cryptocurrency exchanges, and online gambling users.\n\nTheir main methods of attacks are spear phishing using macros, watering hole attacks exploiting Active-X\nvulnerabilities, vulnerability exploits on security and IT asset management systems, and supply chain attacks.\n\nThe group makes use of well-known backdoors, such as Aryan and Gh0st RAT, but also uses self-developed\nbackdoors, such as Andarat, Andaratm, Rifdoor, and Phandoor. Furthermore, this group appears to know Korean\nlanguage and its IT environment.\n\nThis report describes the several cyberattacks by Andariel Threat Group including main methods, and changes in\ntheir purpose and targets.\n\n## Attack Vectors (Infection Routes)\n\nThe Andariel group uses a variety of attack techniques, and, in particular, they take advantage of vulnerabilities of\nlocal software in South Korea.\n\n[Figure 1] Major attack vectors of the Andariel group\n\n\n-----\n\nAnalysis Report_Andariel Threat Group\n\n### 1. Spear Phishing\n\nThe Andariel group uses the spear phishing method by understanding their target and sending emails with an\nattachment that appears to be from a relevant, seemingly trustworthy source. The attachments contain macro\nand trick the targeted recipient into activating the macro. However, this method of inducing macro activation has\nbecome more devious after 2015.\n\n[Figure 2] below shows the contents of attachments used in the 2015 attacks with the original method of inducing\nmacro activation. The user can enable macro, but there is not a significant need to do so because the content is\nvisible.\n\n[Figure 2] Contents of documents used in the 2015 attack\n\nHowever, malicious attachments found since 2017 show a new method. The contents of documents are blurred,\nas shown in [Figure 3], as if there is a problem with the display, increasing the likelihood of the recipients enabling\nthe macros.\n\n[Figure 3] Contents of documents used in the 2017 attack\n\n\n-----\n\nAnalysis Report_Andariel Threat Group\n\n### 2. Watering Hole (Active-X Vulnerability)\n\nThe Andariel group also uses the watering hole technique, which compromise and inject exploit codes into a\nwebsite. The targeted systems are infected with malware upon accessing the compromised website using a\nvulnerable web browser. These attacks also limit infection to specific IP address ranges, making it much more\ndifficult to identify the attack targets.\n\nFor the watering hole attack, the group usually embeds an Active-X vulnerability exploit codes in the target website.\nWhen the target accesses the website via an Internet Explorer browser with a specific Active-X installed the attack\nproceeds. After successful exploitation of the vulnerability, a JavaScript or VBScript file is created on the user\nsystem and this file downloads the malware from a specified address.\n\n[Figure 4] Script file created in the infected system\n\nHere, the \"MZ\" ASCII string, which represents a Windows executable file, does not exist within the file. The\nmalware adds this text string starting with MZ from the local system to create an executable file. This method\nseems to be used to avoid detection by behavior-based security solutions when the executable file is downloaded.\n\n[Figure 5] Downloaded file (above) and 5-byte recovered file (below)\n\n\n-----\n\nAnalysis Report_Andariel Threat Group\n\n### 3. Central Management Solution\n\nInstitutions and companies of a certain size often manage multiple systems in their organizations, such as PCs, by\nconnecting them to a central management solution. This central management solution is mainly responsible for\nNetwork Access Control (NAC); anti-virus management, software and hardware assets control; and patch\nmanagement, and it usually provides features such as IT asset management, report generation, software\ndistribution, and remote control.\n\nThe attacker identifies and analyzes the central management solution used by the target institution or company\nto find and exploit the vulnerability. The attacks on the central management software can be categorized into two\ntypes: management server account attacks and vulnerability attacks on agents installed in the client.\n\n[Figure 6] Concept diagram of the central management solution\n\nMost central management solutions consist of a management server and a client on which the agent is\ninstalled. The management server sends batch files to the connected systems or applies policies, and\nremotely controls the systems. The client processes files and commands sent from the management server.\n\nIn the event of an attack using the management server, the attacker steals the targeted administrator account and\ndistributes malware in the place of a normal file. This is the reason for the emphasis on management of\nadministrator accounts. Another role of the management server is to receive the security updates for commercial\nsoftware from external sources (software providers) and distributes them throughout the organization. However,\nif a file from the external update server tampers (e.g., by hacking); an update file containing malware will be\ndistributed throughout the company or institution via the central management server.\n\nThe client agent of the central management solution is responsible for receiving and executing the file transmitted\nfrom the management server. Generally, the agent has a feature to check whether the delivered command or file\nis verified. To bypass this process, the attacker pretends to be the management server and sends a command to\nthe agent.\n\n\n-----\n\nAnalysis Report_Andariel Threat Group\n\nThe Andariel group is responsible for carrying out many attacks on central management solutions that are widely\nused in South Korea. The following are the cases of the group transferring malicious files exploiting the\nvulnerabilities of the client agent in three types of central management solution.\n\nThe first case is malware that exploits vulnerabilities in central management solution A, which was first discovered\nin 2015. When the malware is executed, the executable file, v3pscan.exe, containing malware is transmitted to the\nagent of central management solution A through a specified IP address and executed.\n\n[Figure 7] Remote execution command used in the attack on the central management solution A\n\nAttacks on the central management solution B were made between 2015 and 2017. Various types of malware\nwere used, such as nc.exe, nt.exe, n5lic.exe, nc5rt2.exe, and Bin.exe, to exploit the management system. Also, the\nattacker used a method of generating a VBScript file, such as vs1.vbs and winrm.vbs, to download malicious files.\n\nVariants of this malware were discovered between 2015 and 2017, which used the server IP, target system IP,\ndownload address, remote executable path, and other items as arguments to exploit systems and generate\nscript files that downloaded malware. The generated script downloads a file from the address entered as an\nargument and restores 5 bytes.\n\n[Figure 8] Attack tool used in the attack on the central management solution B\n\nThe malware that exploited the vulnerabilities in central management solution C was first found in September\n2016. This attack performs malicious transferring and executing of files.\n\n\n-----\n\nAnalysis Report_Andariel Threat Group\n\n[Figure 9] Attack tool used in the attack on the central management solution C\n\n### 4. Supply Chain Attack\n\nThe Andariel group is also known for their attacks on supply chain vulnerabilities. The primary attack method\nincludes incorporating the malware in the software installer edition to infect the target via distribution from the\nofficial website and software updates. However, in some cases, the attack was not designed to infect all software\nusers but only the specified target IP address. The group also used the supply chain attack to exploit vulnerabilities\nof software used in specific industries.\n\n## Attack Cases\n\nThe initial targets of the Andariel group were military agencies and the defense industry in South Korea.\n\nIn 2015, there was an attack on exhibitors in the Seoul International Aerospace & Defense Exhibition (ADEX). ADEX\nis an international defense industry exhibition that has been hosted bi-annually since 1996. The attacker sent an\nemail with an Excel or Word document containing macros, pretending to be the organizer of the event. The\nattached document was disguised as a legitimate content, and malware was downloaded when the recipient\nopened the file and clicked \"Use Content\" to activate the macro. The downloaded file was a Rifdoor variant.\n\nFrom the document file found later, it seems that the attack group focused on its attacks mainly on the defense\nindustry. [Table 1] below summarizes significant attacks made by the Andariel group.\n\n|First Detection|Attack Target|Attack Method|Malicious Act|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|July 2015|Asset management solution|Unidentified|- Stole digital certificates of the company and used the signature in a malicious attempt|\n|November 2015|ADEX exhibitors|Macro-based spear phishing|- Unknown|\n|February 2016|Security company|Security program vulnerability|- Stole digital certificates of the company and used the signature in a malicious attempt - Attacks assumed to have started since November 2015|\n|February 2016|Unidentified|Disguised as a DRM product|- Unknown|\n|April 2016|Defense industry, marine, and ICT service providers|Vulnerability in central management solution B|- Unknown|\n\n\n-----\n\nAnalysis Report_Andariel Threat Group\n\nMega-companies in the\n\nVulnerability in central\n\nJune 2016 defense industry  - Leakage of classified data, such as aircraft drawings\n\nmanagement system A\n\nVulnerability in the vaccine\nAugust 2016 Military agencies  - Leakage of military data\nprogram management system\n\nOctober\n\nOnline gamblers Various utility installation files            - Gambling game cheats to look at the cards\n2016\n\nJanuary Vulnerability in the internet cafe\n\nOnline gamblers            - Gambling game cheats to look at the cards\n2017 management system\n\n                                            - Leaking credit card information and replicating the\ncard overseas (Users of the replicated cards were\n\nATM manufacturer and Vulnerability in the vaccine\nMarch 2017 arrested)\n\nATMs program management system\n\n                                         - Attacks assumed to have started since November\n2016\n\nDisguised (or tempered) as a\nMarch 2017 Unidentified  - Additionally downloaded malware\n\npayment gateway\n\nApril 2017 Energy research center Unidentified  - At least 2 confirmed attacked attempts\n\n                                           - Malware infection through the financial union\nMay 2017 Financial industry Vulnerability of Report A Active-X\nwebsite\n\nVulnerability in the central\n\nJune 2017 Financial industry management solution B, spear  - Unknown\n\nphishing (macro)\n\nReport A vulnerability,                             - Leakage of customers’ personal information\n\nOctober\n\nTravel agency A vulnerability in central             - Attacks assumed to have started since September\n2017\n\nmanagement solution B 2017\n\nDecember  - Similar to the malware used in the attacks on travel\n\nTravel agency B Unidentified\n2017 agency A\n\nDecember  - Tampering the update file to make users to\n\nICT Update on ERP product A\n2017 download malware additionally\n\n                                             - Tampering the installation file to make users\n\nDecember\n\nCryptocurrency Exchange Remote support A installation file download a malicious file when downloading from a\n2017\n\nspecific virtual money exchange\nFebruary  - Impersonating the national assembly member's\n\nCryptocurrency Exchange Macro-based emails\n2018 office\n\nActive-X vulnerability in the ERP\nApril 2018 Unidentified  - Unknown\n\nproduct B\n\n[Table 1] Major attacks of the Andariel group\n\nIn February 2016, a Korean security company was hacked, and an electronic certificate was leaked. Recently in\nAugust 2018, an additional malware was discovered to be distributed as a legitimate DRM program.\n\nIn April 2016, defense industry, marine service providers, and ICT companies were infected with Gh0st RAT, a\nmalware that exploits vulnerabilities in central management solution B. In June 2016, the Korean police\nagency unveiled operation Gh0st RAT, a large-scale hacking incident on mega companies in the defense\nindustry that exploited the vulnerabilities in centralized management solutions. Gh0st RAT is a malware that\nattempts to infect the target through the file distribution function using the vulnerabilities of central\nmanagement solution A, and about 40,000 documents were leaked by the Gh0st RAT malware.\n\n|June 2016|Mega-companies in the defense industry|Vulnerability in central management system A|- Leakage of classified data, such as aircraft drawings|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|August 2016|Military agencies|Vulnerability in the vaccine program management system|- Leakage of military data|\n|October 2016|Online gamblers|Various utility installation files|- Gambling game cheats to look at the cards|\n|January 2017|Online gamblers|Vulnerability in the internet cafe management system|- Gambling game cheats to look at the cards|\n|March 2017|ATM manufacturer and ATMs|Vulnerability in the vaccine program management system|- Leaking credit card information and replicating the card overseas (Users of the replicated cards were arrested) - Attacks assumed to have started since November 2016|\n|March 2017|Unidentified|Disguised (or tempered) as a payment gateway|- Additionally downloaded malware|\n|April 2017|Energy research center|Unidentified|- At least 2 confirmed attacked attempts|\n|May 2017|Financial industry|Vulnerability of Report A Active-X|- Malware infection through the financial union website|\n|June 2017|Financial industry|Vulnerability in the central management solution B, spear phishing (macro)|- Unknown|\n|October 2017|Travel agency A|Report A vulnerability, vulnerability in central management solution B|- Leakage of customers’ personal information - Attacks assumed to have started since September 2017|\n|December 2017|Travel agency B|Unidentified|- Similar to the malware used in the attacks on travel agency A|\n|December 2017|ICT|Update on ERP product A|- Tampering the update file to make users to download malware additionally|\n|December 2017|Cryptocurrency Exchange|Remote support A installation file|- Tampering the installation file to make users download a malicious file when downloading from a specific virtual money exchange|\n|February 2018|Cryptocurrency Exchange|Macro-based emails|- Impersonating the national assembly member's office|\n|April 2018|Unidentified|Active-X vulnerability in the ERP product B|- Unknown|\n\n\n-----\n\nAnalysis Report_Andariel Threat Group\n\nEver since August 2016, the Andariel group has exploited the vulnerabilities in anti-virus management programs\nto attack military agencies and leak information. From the end of 2016, the purpose of the attack changed from\ninformation leakage to monetary gain. In October 2016, the attacker hacked the website of a software provider\nand replaced the installation file with a file containing malware to release malicious codes that served as cheats in\nonline gambling games. In 2017, to maximize the chances of a successful attack, malware was distributed to\nmultiple computers using an internet cafe management program.\n\nIn March 2017, a case was discovered where credit card information was leaked due to the hacking of an ATM\nin Korea. It seems attempts were made from November 2016, and the malware used in the attack was similar\nto those used in the leaking of a military agency’s data in 2016.\n\nFrom May to July 2017, there were concentrated attacks on the financial industry. The malware was\ndistributed through the website of monetary unions, and the attacks attempted to exploit the vulnerability\nof their systems.\n\nIn October 2017, the largest travel agency in Korea was hacked, resulting in the leakage of personal\ninformation. Moreover, travel agency was hacked in December of the same year. In December 2017, the\nAndariel group modified the ERP solution update file of a company A and added malware to the file. At that\ntime, malware was downloaded only to attack a specific target company, and not all companies using the ERP\nsolution.\n\nIn December 2017, the Andariel group launched attacks on virtual currency exchange users. In January 2018,\nit distributed a remote support program containing malware. In February 2018, the group employed various\ntypes of attacks, including the email attack where it impersonated the office of a National Assembly member.\nMalware used in the email attack was a variant of the malware used in the ATM hacking in 2017, and another\nvariant was used in the attacks on the financial industry in June.\n\n## Malware and Attack Tools\n\n### 1. Malware – Backdoor\n\nThe Andariel group uses in-house advanced malware, such as Andarat, Andaratm, Phandoor, and Rifdoor, as well\nas other well-known malware, such as Aryan and Gh0st RAT.\n\n#### 1.1) Aryan\n\nAryan was detected in 2015 and is characterized by the string \"F**k Hack Hound.\"\n\n\n-----\n\nAnalysis Report_Andariel Threat Group\n\n#### 1.2) Gh0st RAT \n\n\n\n[Figure 10] Strings in Aryan\n\n\nGh0st RAT is a backdoor made in China, and its source codes are publicly available. The Andariel group used this\nmalware for attacks from 2015 to 2016. It created and used a Korean version in some cases. Packagers, such as\nThemida packaged some variants.\n\n[Figure 11] Strings in Gh0st RAT\n\n[Figure 12] shows the Chinese attack tools converted into Korean and used by the Andariel group.\n\n[Figure 12] Chinese (back) and Korean (front) controllers\n\n#### 1.3) Rifdoor \n\nRifdoor was first discovered in November 2015, and it remained active until early 2016. A Rifdoor variant was\nused to attack SEOUL ADEX exhibitors in 2015 and was found in the hacking incidents of security companies\nin early 2016.\n\nRifdoor is characterized by the string included in the PDB information: E:\\Data\\My Projects\\Troy Source\nCode\\tcp1st\\rifle\\Release\\rifle.pdb.\n\n\n-----\n\nAnalysis Report_Andariel Threat Group\n\n[Figure 13] PDB Information of Rifdoor\n\nWhen it enters the system, Rifdoor generates a file by adding garbage data to the 4 bytes of the last part of the file.\nTherefore, since the hash value changes each time the system is infected, the malware cannot be found in the\nsystem with a simple hash value.\n\n[Figure 14] Comparison of original and generated files\n\n[Table 2] shows the major commands associated with Rifdoor and their respective functions.\n\nCommand Function\n$interval Standby\n$downloadexec Download and execute file\n$download Download file\n(Default) Execute file (cmd.exe)\n\n[Table 2] Main commands of Rifdoor\n\nRifdoor variants have slightly different PDB information as shown in [Table 3].\n\nC:\\Users\\C8\\Desktop\\rifle\\Release\\rifle.pdb\nE:\\Data\\My Projects\\Troy Source Code\\tcp1st\\rifle\\Release\\rifle.pdb\nE:\\Data\\My Projects\\Troy Source Code\\tcp1st\\server\\Release\\server.pdb\n\n[Table 3] PDB Information of the Rifdoor variant\n\n#### 1.4) Phandoor \n\nPhandoor was used from January 2016 to the summer of 2017. It is characterized by having the string \"S^%\" before\nthe main character strings. (E.g. S^%s\\cmd.exe, S^nehomegpa.dll) However, some variants found in 2017 did not\ncontain its character string, \"Anonymous?\"\n\n|Command|Function|\n|---|---|\n|$interval|Standby|\n|$downloadexec|Download and execute file|\n|$download|Download file|\n|(Default)|Execute file (cmd.exe)|\n\n\n-----\n\nAnalysis Report_Andariel Threat Group\n\n[Figure 15] Strings in Phandoor\n\nWhen Phandoor is executed, it initializes and tries to connect to C&C server. At this time, the string \"Anonymous?\"\nis sent to check whether that the server is functioning properly.\n\n[Figure 16] Anonymous check code\n\nAfter that, it receives commands from the C&C server such as to execute the cmd.exe file.\n\n**Command** **Function**\n\n0x9 Drive information\n\n0xA File search\n0xB Receive data online for file creation\n0x10 Re-execute the main function after a set period\n\n0x12 Relocate the nehomegpa.dll file\n\n0x19 Get the process list\n0x1A End process\n0x1B Elevate privileges\n\n[Table 4] Main commands of Phandoor\n\n#### 1.5) Andaratm \n\nAndaratm malware was used in attacks on military agencies in 2016, on ATMs and financial institutions in 2017,\nand on cryptocurrency exchanges in 2018. 18 variants have been identified as of May 2018.\n\nThe codes of Andaratm include strings such as \"%s\\cmd.exe /c echo | %s > %s\" and \"%s*****%s.\"\n\n|Command|Function|\n|---|---|\n|0x9|Drive information|\n|0xA|File search|\n|0xB|Receive data online for file creation|\n|0x10|Re-execute the main function after a set period|\n|0x12|Relocate the nehomegpa.dll file|\n|0x19|Get the process list|\n|0x1A|End process|\n|0x1B|Elevate privileges|\n\n\n-----\n\nAnalysis Report_Andariel Threat Group\n\n[Figure 17] T Strings of Andaratm\n\nWhen Andaratm is executed, it acquires information, such as the computer name and username, attempts to\nconnect to the designated C2 server, and receives and executes the command.\n\nThe encryption method of Andaratm is similar to the methods generally used by malware.\n\n[Figure 18] Encryption method of Andaratm\n\nAndaratm only executes simple commands, such as downloading files, uploading files, and running cmd.exe files.\n\n### 2. Attack Tools\n\nThe attacker uses various tools, such as Putty Link and port scanner, which are used for communication.\n\n[Figure 19] Port scanner\n\nA tool was also used to check the IP and port with file names like pcon.exe, portc.exe, and zcon.exe. A variant of\nZcon.exe was also used in Bmdoor in 2015.\n\n\n-----\n\nAnalysis Report_Andariel Threat Group\n\n[Figure 20] Zcon.exe\n\nThe Andariel group produced malware named Crash.exe and Test.exe; these malware destroy hard disk contents\nafter August of each year. It is not confirmed, however, whether these malware were used in actual attacks.\n\n## Similarities in Multiple Attack Cases\n\nThe Andariel group has launched many attacks using a variety of malware. In addition to the similarity of their\ncodes, factors are indicating the association between these attacks. Results from the detailed analysis of AhnLab\nshows that the Andariel group and Operation Black Mine take the similar attack methods, and in particular, they\nboth used the file, zcon.exe. This suggests that Operation Black Mine is associated with the Andariel group. The\nsimilar malware was used to attack various targets, and some of them used the same C2.\n\n[Figure 21] Association between the Andariel group and other attacks\n\nFor macro-based attacks, there was no significant difference between the macro codes of 2015 and 2017.\n\n\n-----\n\nAnalysis Report_Andariel Threat Group\n\n[Figure 22] Comparison of the macro codes between 2015 (left) and 2017 (right)\n\nBesides, the malware produced by Andariel group uses a similar encryption method.\n\n[Figure 23] Encryption method of the Andariel Group\n\n## AhnLab’s Response\n\nV3, AhnLab’s anti-malware product, has detected malware related to the Andariel group under the following\naliases:\n\n< Aliases identified by AhnLab V3>\n\n- Trojan/Win32.Phandoor (2016.01.13.00)\n\n- Trojan/Win32.Andaratm (2018.05.03.00)\n\n- W97M/Downloader (2017.11.03.00)\n\n- Backdoor/Win32.Aryan (2015.12.23.00)\n\n- Dropper/Win32.Fakeinstaller (2017.01.02.09)\n\n- Trojan/Win32.HackTool (2017.06.27.03)\n\n- Trojan/Win32.Andarat (2017.10.27.03)\n\n- HackTool/Win32.Malsender (2017.04.17.04)\n\n- Trojan/Win32.Rifdoor (2015.12.23.04)\n\n- X97M/Downloader (2015.12.24.05)\n\n\n-----\n\nAnalysis Report_Andariel Threat Group\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Andariel Group is one of the most active threat groups in South Korea. In the early days, most attacks were\ndesigned to steal military information. Since the end of 2016, however, attacks have also been made for monetary\ngain. In addition, based on their frequent attacks using vulnerabilities of software used by the target, it can be seen\nthat the group is well aware of Korea IT environment.\n\nAs evident in the attack cases of the group, central management solutions of companies and institutions can\nbecome a route of an attack at any time. Attacks exploiting a central management solution may cause enormous\ndamage throughout the organization. Thus, more strengthened security management is required.\n\nIn particular, a security policy for the management server of a central management solution is critical. Suitable\nmanagement is required to ensure that necessary security policies are observed, such as frequently changing\nadministrator’s login password of the management server and not saving it in the system, as well as limiting the\naccess to the management server. In addition, logs must be checked periodically to make sure that abnormal files\nhave not been distributed via the management server. There was a case where the attacker exploited the\nvulnerability in an agent installed in the client without going through the management server, so it is necessary to\nmonitor whether or not scanning of the port number used by the central management solution occurs.\n\nAttackers use a variety of methods in their attempts to infiltrate companies and institutions. Most organizations\nfocus on strengthening security on endpoints, but it is just as much essential to monitor events that occur in the\ninternal infrastructure, just like the central management solution.\n\n\n-----\n\nAnalysis Report_Andariel Threat Group\n\n## Reference\n\n[1] AhnLab Reveals the Secret of Operation Black Mine\nhttp://www.ahnlab.com/kr/site/securityinfo/secunews/secuNewsView.do?curPage=&menu_dist=1&seq=24229\n\n[2] Reasons Behind the Continued Attacks on Defense Industries\nhttp://www.ahnlab.com/kr/site/securityinfo/secunews/secuNewsView.do?menu_dist=2&seq=26565\n\n[3] Financial Security Institute Intelligence Report_Threat Group Profiling that Targets Korea\nhttp://www.fsec.or.kr/user/bbs/fsec/21/13/bbsDataView/910.do\n\n[4] Targeted Attacks?
