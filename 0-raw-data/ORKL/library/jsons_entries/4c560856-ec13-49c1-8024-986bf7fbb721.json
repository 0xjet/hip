cheats\n\n**[bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-erbium-password-stealing-malware-spreads-as-game-cracks-cheats/](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-erbium-password-stealing-malware-spreads-as-game-cracks-cheats/)**\n\nBill Toulas\n\nBy\n[Bill Toulas](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/bill-toulas/)\n\nSeptember 26, 2022\n03:54 PM\n0\n\n\n-----\n\nThe new 'Erbium' information-stealing malware is being distributed as fake cracks and\ncheats for popular video games to steal victims' credentials and cryptocurrency wallets.\n\nErbium is a new Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) that provides subscribers with a new\ninformation-stealing malware that is gaining popularity in the cybercrime community thanks\nto its extensive functionality, customer support, and competitive pricing.\n\n[Researchers at Cluster25's team were the first to report on Erbium earlier this month, but a](https://blog.cluster25.duskrise.com/2022/09/15/erbium-stealer-a-new-infostealer)\nnew report by [Cyfirma shares further information on how the password-stealing trojan is](https://www.cyfirma.com/outofband/erbium-stealer-malware-report/)\ndistributed.\n\n## New Malware-as-a-Service operation\n\nErbium has been promoted on Russian-speaking forums since July 2022, but its actual\ndeployment in the wild has been uncertain thus far.\n\nErbium initially cost $9 per week, but since its popularity rose in late August, the price went\nup to $100 per month or $1000 for a full-year license.\n\nCompared to the \"defacto\" choice in the field, RedLine stealer, Erbium's cost is roughly onethird, so it's aiming to disrupt the market for malware commonly used by threat actors.\n\nLike other information-stealing malware, Erbium will steal data stored in web browsers\n(Chromium or Gecko-based), such as passwords, cookies, credit cards, and autofill\ninformation.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe malware also attempts to exfiltrate data from a large set of cryptocurrency wallets\ninstalled on web browsers as extensions.\n\n**Targeted hot cryptocurrency wallets** _(Cyfirma)_\nCold desktop wallets like Exodus, Atomic, Armory, Bitecoin-Core, Bytecoin, Dash-Core,\nElectrum, Electron, Coinomi, Ethereum, Litecoin-Core, Monero-Core, Zcash, and Jaxx are\nalso stolen.\n\nErbium also steals two-factor authentication codes from Trezor Password Manager, EOS\nAuthenticator, Authy 2FA, and Authenticator 2FA.\n\nThe malware can grab screenshots from all monitors, snatch Steam and Discord tokens,\nsteal Telegram auth files, and profile the host based on the OS and hardware.\n\nAll data is exfiltrated to the C2 via a built-in API system, while the operators get an overview\nof what has been stolen from each infected host on a Erbium dashboard, shown below.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Erbium's dashboard** _(Cyfirma)_\nThe malware uses three URLs for connecting to the panel, including Discord's Content\nDelivery Network (CDN), a platform that malware operators have heavily abused.\n\nWhile Erbium is still a work in progress, users on hacker forums have praised the author's\nefforts and willingness to listen to client requests.\n\nCluster25 reported signs of Erbium infections worldwide, including in the USA, France,\nColombia, Spain, Italy, India, Vietnam, and Malaysia.\n\n**Erbium distribution map** _(Cluster25)_\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile the first Erbium campaign uses game cracks as lures, the distribution channels could\ndiversify significantly anytime, as buyers of the malware may choose to push it via different\nmethods.\n\nTo keep the threat out of your system, avoid downloading pirated software, scan all\ndownloaded files on an AV tool, and keep your software up to date by installing the latest\navailable security patches.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Malicious PyPi packages turn Discord into
