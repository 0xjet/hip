But there are also other threats stirring up as of late: attacks that spy on and\nsteal data from specific targets, crossing over between desktops and mobile devices.\n\nTake for instance several malicious apps we came across with cyberespionage capabilities,\nwhich were targeting Arabic-speaking users or Middle Eastern countries. These were\npublished on Google Play — but have since been taken down — and third-party app\nmarketplaces. We named these malicious apps AnubisSpy (ANDROIDOS_ANUBISSPY) as\nall the malware’s payload is a package called watchdog.\n\nWe construe AnubisSpy to be linked to the cyberespionage campaign Sphinx (APT-C15) based on shared file structures and command-and-control (C&C) server as well as\ntargets. It’s also possible that while AnubisSpy’s operators may also be Sphinx’s, they could\nbe running separate but similar campaigns.\n\n**What can AnubisSpy do?**\n\nAnubisSpy can steal messages (SMS), photos, videos, contacts, email accounts, calendar\nevents, and browser histories (i.e., Chrome and Samsung Internet Browser). It can also take\n\n\n-----\n\nscreenshots and record audio, including calls. It can spy on the victim through apps installed\non the device, a list of which is in its configuration file that can be updated. This includes\nSkype, WhatsApp, Facebook, and Twitter, among others.\n\nAfter the data are collected, they are encrypted and sent to the (C&C) server. AnubisSpy can\nalso self-destruct to cover its tracks. It can run commands and delete files on the device, as\nwell as install and uninstall Android Application Packages (APKs).\n\nAnubisSpy has several modules, each of which has a separate role. AnubisSpy’s code is\nwell constructed, indicating the developer/s’ know-how. Below is a visualization of the\nmodules:\n\n_Figure 1: Structure of AnubisSpy’s modules_\n\n**How is AnubisSpy related to Sphinx?**\n[Sphinx reportedly uses the watering hole technique via social media sites to deliver its](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/us/threat-encyclopedia/web-attack/137/watering-hole-101)\n[payloads — mainly a customized version of njRAT. The Sphinx campaign operators cloaked](http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/new-rats-emerge-from-leaked-njw0rm-source-code/)\nthe malware with icons of legitimate applications to dupe recipients into clicking them. Sphinx\nwas active between June 2014 and November 2015, but timestamps of the malware indicate\nthe attacks started as early as 2011.\n\nA simple WHOIS query of AnubisSpy’s C&C server showed it abused a legitimate managed\nhosting service provider in Belize. We correlated the AnubisSpy variants to Sphinx’s\ndesktop/PC-targeting malware through the following:\n\nShared C&C server, 86[.]105[.]18[.]107\nShared technique of decrypting JSON files, and similarity between the file structures of\nAnubisSpy and Sphinx’s malware\nSimilar targets (highly concentrated in Middle Eastern countries)\n\n_Figure 2: Comparison of file structure in Sphinx’s desktop/PC-targeting malware (left) and_\n_AnubisSpy (right)_\n\nThese apps were all written in Arabic and, in one way or another, related to something in\nEgypt (i.e., spoofing an Egypt-based TV program and using news/stories in the Middle East)\nregardless of the labels and objects in the apps. Our coordination with Google also revealed\nthat these apps were installed across a handful of countries in the Middle East.\n\n**Was AnubisSpy actively distributed?**\n\nWe analyzed seven apps that were actually AnubisSpy. These were signed with the same\nfake Google certificates. We found two more apps created by the same developer, but they\nhad no espionage-related codes; we think they were made as experimental projects. Based\n\n\n-----\n\non hardcoded strings in the Agent Version, the malicious apps were developed as early as\nApril 2015. Timestamps indicate that the earliest sample was signed on June 2015; the latest\nvariant was signed on May 2017.\n\nAnubisSpy wasn’t only published on Google Play. We also found versions of it in third-party\napp marketplaces, most likely as a way to expand the malware’s reach. The apps mainly\nused Middle East-based news and sociopolitical themes as social engineering hooks and\nabused social media to further proliferate. Versions of AnubisSpy posed as social news,\npromotional, healthcare, and entertainment apps.\n\n**What does AnubisSpy mean to the mobile landscape?**\n\nPersistent and furtive spyware is an underrated problem for the mobile platform. While\ncyberespionage campaigns on mobile devices may be few and far between compared to\nones for desktops or PCs, AnubisSpy proves that they do indeed occur, and may have been\nmore active than initially thought. Will mobile become cyberespionage’s main frontier? It\nwon’t be a surprise given mobile platform’s [increasing ubiquity, especially in workplaces.](https://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3725117)\n\nBeyond its effects, AnubisSpy also highlights the significance of proactively securing mobile\n[devices, particularly if they’re on BYOD programs and used to access sensitive data.](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/-infosec-guide-bring-your-own-device-byod)\nEnforcing the principle of least privilege and implementing an app reputation system are just\nsome of the best practices that can help mitigate threats.\n\nWe disclosed our findings to Google on October 12 and worked with Google on further\n[analyzing the AnubisSpy-related apps. Updates were also made to Google Play Protect to](https://www.android.com/play-protect/)\ntake appropriate action against those apps that have been verified as in violation of Google\nPlay policy. An in-depth technical analysis of AnubisSpy, along with indicators of\n[compromise, is in this technical brief.](https://documents.trendmicro.com/assets/tech-brief-cyberespionage-campaign-sphinx-goes-mobile-with-anubisspy.pdf)\n\n**Trend Micro Solutions**\n\nEnd users and enterprises can also benefit from multilayered mobile security solutions such\nas Trend Micro™ [Mobile Security which is also available on Google Play.

This threat\nactor was called Two-tailed Scorpion/APT-C-23. A mobile component called VAMP was\nfound, with a new variant (dubbed FrozenCell) discovered in October.\n\nBy: Ecular Xu, Grey Guo December 19, 2017 Read time: ( words)\n\nContent added to Folio\n\n\n-----",
