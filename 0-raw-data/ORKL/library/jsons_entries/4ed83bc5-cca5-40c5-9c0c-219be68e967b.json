If\nyou must connect your NAS to the internet, we highly recommend using a trusted VPN or a\nmyQNAPcloud link.”\n\nQNAP did not specify which vulnerabilities the AgeLocker gang was abusing.\n\nIt is unclear if the AgeLocker gang was hunting for QNAP NAS systems left unpatched or if\nthey were targeting a recently patched vulnerability.\n\nToday’s advisory comes after last week QNAP warned of similar attacks against its NAS\nsystems from the [Qlocker and eCh0raix ransomware strains.](https://therecord.media/new-qlocker-ransomware-is-hitting-hundreds-of-qnap-nas-devices-per-day/)\n\n\n-----\n\nAccording to statistics provided by the ID-Ransomware service, there doesn t seem to be a\nparticular spike in activity from the AgeLocker group, which suggests these new AgeLocker\nattacks are not happening on the same scale as the Qlocker attacks from last week.\n\nThe AgeLocker ransomware was first spotted in the wild in July 2020 when it exploited bugs\n[in the QNAP NAS firmware (known as QTS) and in a preinstalled app named PhotoStation.](https://www.qnap.com/qts/)\n\nThe company warned of these attacks a few months later, [in September 2020, when](https://www.qnap.com/en/security-advisory/qsa-20-06)\ncustomer incidents started to rise.\n\nAgeLocker is the fourth ransomware strain known to target QNAP NAS devices\nafter [Qlocker,](https://www.qnap.com/en/security-news/2021/response-to-qlocker-ransomware-attacks-take-actions-to-secure-qnap-nas) [eCh0raix, and](https://www.qnap.com/en/security-advisory/qsa-20-02) [Muhstik. AgeLocker’s name comes from its use of the Actually](https://www.zdnet.com/article/white-hat-hacks-muhstik-ransomware-gang-and-releases-decryption-keys/)\n[Good Encryption (AGE) algorithm to encrypt files.](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age)\n\nBesides ransomware, QNAP NAS devices have also been historically targeted by\nthe [Dovecat and](https://www.qnap.com/en/security-news/2021/response-to-cyber-attacks-take-action-to-secure-your-qnap-nas) [UnityMiner crypto-miners and the QSnatch backdoor trojan.](https://blog.netlab.360.com/qnap-nas-users-make-sure-you-check-your-system/)\n\nTags\n\n[malware](https://therecord.media/tag/malware/)\n[NAS](https://therecord.media/tag/nas/)\n[network-attached storage](https://therecord.media/tag/network-attached-storage/)\n[QNAP](https://therecord.media/tag/qnap/)\n[Ransomware](https://therecord.media/tag/ransomware/)\n[Taiwan](https://therecord.media/tag/taiwan/)\n\nCatalin Cimpanu is a cybersecurity reporter for The Record.
