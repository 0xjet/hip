The attack is linked to vulnerabilities in\nMicrosoft Exchange, which affected several businesses.\n\n\"The Storting does not yet know the full extent of the attack. A number of measures have\nbeen implemented in our systems, and the analysis work is ongoing. The Storting has\nreceived confirmation that data has been extracted,\" the Storting disclosed in a statement.\n\nAt this time, the Storting has confirmed that the threat actors have stolen data as part of the\ncyberattack but are still investigating.\n\n\"We know that data has been extracted, but we do not yet have a full overview of the\nsituation. We have implemented comprehensive measures and cannot rule out that it will be\nimplemented further.\"\n\n\"The work takes place in collaboration with the security authorities. The situation is currently\nunclear, and we do not know the full potential for damage,\" says Storting director Marianne\nAndreassen.\n\n[However, they do not believe this attack is related to their cyberattack in December 2020,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/norway-russian-apt28-state-hackers-likely-behind-parliament-attack/)\nattributed to the Russian APT 28 state-sponsored hacking group.\n\nWhile Microsoft initially attributed the recent Microsoft Exchange server attacks on a\nChinese hacking group known as Hafnium, we have later learned that other hacking groups\nhad been using them as well.\n\nAccording to a new report by cybersecurity firm ESET, in addition to Hafnium, other\ncybercrime groups known as Tick, LuckyMouse, and Calypso had also been exploiting the\nzero-day vulnerabilities before the patches were released.\n\nIn a new report released today, ESET states that even more hacking groups are jumping\ninto the Microsoft Exchange frenzy as they rush to hack systems before they are patched.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Cisco urges admins to patch IOS XR zero-day exploited in attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cisco-urges-admins-to-patch-ios-xr-zero-day-exploited-in-attacks/)\n\n[Chinese hackers behind most zero-day exploits during 2021](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/chinese-hackers-behind-most-zero-day-exploits-during-2021/)\n\n[Google Chrome emergency update fixes zero-day used in attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/google-chrome-emergency-update-fixes-zero-day-used-in-attacks/)\n\n[Microsoft April 2022 Patch Tuesday fixes 119 flaws, 2 zero-days](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-april-2022-patch-tuesday-fixes-119-flaws-2-zero-days/)\n\n[New Spring Java framework zero-day allows remote code execution](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-spring-java-framework-zero-day-allows-remote-code-execution/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Microsoft Exchange](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/microsoft-exchange/)\n[Norway](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/norway/)\n[Parliament](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/parliament/)\n[Storting](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/storting/)\n[Vulnerability](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/vulnerability/)\n[Zero-Day](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/zero-day/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
