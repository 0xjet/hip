The\ninstructions, in turn, alter a computer's MBR, or master boot record, another system\ncomponent that gets executed prior to the loading of the operating system of an infected\nmachine. By corrupting the processes that run immediately after a PC starts, the malware\nstands a better chance of surviving attempts by antivirus programs to remove it.\n\nIn addition to posing a threat to end users, Mebroot could create serious obstacles to\nantivirus developers in producing products that scrub computers clean of detected threats\nwithout harming the underlying system.\n\n\n-----\n\nA flowchart from Symantec detailing Mebromi's BIOS tampering process.\n\n\"Storing the malicious code inside the BIOS ROM could actually become more than just a\nproblem for security software, giv[en] the fact that even if antivirus detect[s] and clean[s] the\nMBR infection, it will be restored at the next system startup when the malicious BIOS\npayload would overwrite the MBR code again,\" Webroot researcher Marco Giuliani wrote in a\n[blog post published Tuesday. \"Developing an antivirus utility able to clean the BIOS code is a](http://blog.webroot.com/2011/09/13/mebromi-the-first-bios-rootkit-in-the-wild/)\nchallenge, because it needs to be totally error-proof, to avoid rendering the system\nunbootable at all.\"\n\nHe went on to say the job of ridding malicious instructions added to the BIOS ultimately\nshould be left to the makers of the motherboards that store the startup code. Because the\nBIOS is stored on an EEPROM, or electronically erasable programmable read-only-memory\n\n\n-----\n\nchip, modifications have the potential to render a computer largely inoperable with no easy\nway to fix it.\n\nThe discovery represents one of the few times researchers have documented malware used\nin the wild that modifies the BIOS. In the late 1990s, malware known as CIH/Chernobyl did\nmuch the same thing on machines running Windows 9x by exploiting a privilege escalation\nbug in the Microsoft operating systems. In 2007, proof-of-concept software known as IceLord\nalso reportedly made changes to the BIOS of infected machines, but there are no reports it\nhas ever been used in actual attacks.\n\nMebromi is able to attack only BIOS ROMs made by Award, a manufacturer that was\npurchased by Phoenix in the late 1990s. The malware checks the BIOS ROM each time the\nPC boots up. If it's made by Award and the malicious instructions aren't found, Mebromi adds\nthe code by reflashing the chip on the motherboard. According to Giuliani, it was first\n[documented by the Chinese security company Qihoo 360, and primarily infects computers in](http://bbs.360.cn/4005462/251096134.html)\nthat country.\n\n[Symantec researchers have more about Mebromi here. ®](http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/bios-threat-showing-again)\n\n_This article was updated to clarify the type of chip stores the BIOS._\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\nStolen university credentials up for sale by Russian crooks, FBI warns\n\nForget dark-web souks, thousands of these are already being traded on public bazaars\n\n[Jessica Lyons Hardcastle Fri 27 May 2022 // 22:34 UTC](http://www.theregister.co.uk/Author/Jessica-Lyons-Hardcastle)\nRussian crooks are selling network credentials and virtual private network access for a\n\"multitude\" of US universities and colleges on criminal marketplaces, according to the\nFBI.\n\nAccording to a warning issued on Thursday, these stolen credentials sell for thousands\nof dollars on both dark web and public internet forums, and could lead to subsequent\ncyberattacks against individual employees or the schools themselves.\n\n\"The exposure of usernames and passwords can lead to brute force credential stuffing\ncomputer network attacks, whereby attackers attempt logins across various internet\nsites or exploit them for subsequent cyber attacks as criminal actors take advantage of\nusers recycling the same credentials across multiple accounts, internet sites, and\n[services,\" the Feds' alert [PDF] said.](https://www.ic3.gov/Media/News/2022/220526.pdf)\n\n[Continue reading](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2022/05/27/fbi_warning_stolen_university_credentials/?td=keepreading-btm)\n\n\n-----\n\nBig Tech loves talking up privacy – while trying to kill privacy legislation\n\nStudy claims Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, Microsoft work to derail data rules\n\n[Thomas Claburn in San Francisco Fri 27 May 2022 // 21:48 UTC 2](http://www.theregister.co.uk/Author/Thomas-Claburn)\nAmazon, Apple, Google, Meta, and Microsoft often support privacy in public\nstatements, but behind the scenes they've been working through some common\norganizations to weaken or kill privacy legislation in US states.\n\n[That's according to a report this week from news non-profit The Markup, which said the](https://themarkup.org/privacy/2022/05/26/tech-industry-groups-are-watering-down-attempts-at-privacy-regulation-one-state-at-a-time)\ncorporations hire lobbyists from the same few groups and law firms to defang or drown\nstate privacy bills.\n\nThe report examined 31 states when state legislatures were considering privacy\nlegislation and identified 445 lobbyists and lobbying firms working on behalf of Amazon,\nApple, Google, Meta, and Microsoft, along with industry groups like TechNet and the\nState Privacy and Security Coalition.\n\n[Continue reading](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2022/05/27/big_tech_privacy/?td=keepreading-btm)\nSEC probes Musk for not properly disclosing Twitter stake\n\nMeanwhile, social network's board rejects resignation of one its directors\n\n[Katyanna Quach Fri 27 May 2022 // 21:26 UTC 2](http://www.theregister.co.uk/Author/Katyanna-Quach)\nAmerica's financial watchdog is investigating whether Elon Musk adequately disclosed\nhis purchase of Twitter shares last month, just as his bid to take over the social media\ncompany hangs in the balance.\n\n[A letter [PDF] from the SEC addressed to the tech billionaire said he \"[did] not appear\"](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1418091/000000000022003713/filename1.pdf)\n[to have filed the proper form detailing his 9.2 percent stake in Twitter \"required 10 days](https://www.theregister.com/2022/04/04/elon_musk_twitter/)\nfrom the date of acquisition,\" and asked him to provide more information.
