Since these URLs are hosted on legitimate\ndomains, they can be especially difficult for many phishing detection engines to detect.\n[Furthermore, these platforms typically require little to no coding experience, significantly](https://www.noupe.com/technology/what-is-no-code-development.html)\nlowering the barrier to entry for creating and launching phishing attacks.\n\nFrom the beginning of 2020 to June 2022, Palo Alto Networks analyzed the URLs detected\nby our [Advanced URL Filtering service, and discovered that the number of phishing URLs](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/advanced-url-filtering)\nhosted on legitimate SaaS platforms has continued to increase at an alarming rate In fact\n\n\n-----\n\nfrom June 2021-June 2022, the rate of newly detected phishing URLs hosted on legitimate\nSaaS platforms has increased over 1100%.\n\nThe Palo Alto Networks Advanced URL Filtering uses deep learning to analyze the content\nof each webpage at the URL level instead of the domain level. Customers with an Advanced\nURL Filtering subscription therefore receive protections from these platform-abuse phishing\nattacks.\n\nRelated Unit 42 Topics [Phishing,](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/tag/phishing/) [Credential Theft](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/tag/credential-theft/)\n\n## Table of Contents\n\nIntroduction to Platform-Abuse Phishing Attacks\n\nMethodology\n\nResults: Platform-Abuse Phishing Is on the Rise\n\nPlatform-Abuse Phishing Case Studies\n\nConclusion\n\nAcknowledgements\n\n## Introduction to Platform-Abuse Phishing Attacks\n\nToday, more organizations are adopting existing SaaS tools for tasks like handling file\nstorage, building websites, and more importantly, enabling collaboration within and outside of\nthe organization. For example, many website builders allow users to easily create websites\nwithout having to write any code themselves, and form builders allow users to easily create\nand share surveys, registration forms, etc. Recently, we’ve seen that cybercriminals have\nbegun to abuse these SaaS platforms for their own nefarious uses. In early 2022, we noticed\nan uptick in phishing URLs hosted on legitimate SaaS platforms, and we decided to further\ninvestigate this trend.\n\n## Methodology\n\nFirst, we gathered a list of various SaaS platforms that could potentially be used to host\nphishing attacks. We then looked at the phishing URLs discovered by The Palo Alto\n[Networks Advanced URL Filtering service from January 2020-June 2022 and used](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/advanced-url-filtering)\nsignature-based pattern matching to determine which phishing URLs were hosted on each\nSaaS platform.\n\nExamples of the types of SaaS platforms we studied are shown in Table 1.\n\n**Platform Type** **Description**\n\nFile Sharing Sites for hosting and/or sharing files\n\n\n-----\n\nForm Builders Sites for creating forms, surveys, etc.\n\nWebsite Builders Popular website builders, typically requiring no coding experience\n\n\nNote\nTaking/Collaboration\n\n\nSites for taking notes, writing documentation, creating internal\ndashboards, etc. Various productivity tools.\n\n\nDesign/Prototyping Sites for designing/prototyping wireframes, infographics, mockups,\netc.\n\nPersonal Branding Sites for hosting social media links, personal portfolios, etc.\n\n_Table 1. Breakdown of types ofSaaS platforms studied in this research._\n\n## Results: Platform-Abuse Phishing Is on the Rise\n\nIn Figures 1 and 2 respectively, we show the number of newly discovered phishing URLs\nhosted on legitimate SaaS platforms per week, as well as the percentage of all newly\ndiscovered phishing URLs that we found being hosted on legitimate SaaS platforms. We can\nsee that the prevalence of platform-abuse phishing URLs has increased significantly from\n2020, both in terms of raw numbers and percentage. Although there was a slight dip during\nthe 2021-22 holiday season, starting in February 2022, the trend began to surge once again.\n\nFigure 1. Newly created phishing URLs hosted on legitimate SaaS platforms per week.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2. Percentage of newly discovered phishing URLs hosted on legitimate SaaS\nplatforms.\nNext, we separately analyzed the trends in each SaaS platform subcategory and normalized\neach subcategory’s “platform abuse” rate to a prevalence value between 0 and 1. A value of\n1 represents the week in which that platform type saw the largest number of new phishing\nURLs.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3. Phishing prevalence within each SaaS platform subcategory, normalized.\nGenerally speaking, each type of SaaS platform saw an increase in phishing activity in the\nlatter half of 2021, with the most noticeable increases occurring between September-October\n2021. More recently, we observed a larger increase beginning in February 2022. With new\nSaaS platforms continuing to rise in popularity, it is likely that this trend will continue into the\nfuture, making it absolutely critical that URL Filtering products are equipped with the right\ncapabilities to detect these types of phishing URLs.\n\n## Platform-Abuse Phishing Case Studies\n\nWe have highlighted a variety of case studies to demonstrate the types of tactics these\nplatform-abuse phishing URLs employ.\n\nIn Figure 4, we see a file-sharing URL that shows a preview of a document related to a\nremittance payment. However, upon clicking the “View Now” button, the user is taken to a\ncredential-stealing page built using a popular website builder, which prompts the user to\nenter their login credentials to view a sensitive document.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4. Left: Landing page for a phishing attack, hosted on a file-sharing site. Sent in an\nemail with the subject line: “Re: [REDACTED COMPANY NAME] Wire.” Right: Credentialstealing page built using a popular website builder, linked to by the page on the left.In Figure\n5, we see an example of a credential-stealing page hosted on a site built by a legitimate form\nbuilder. On the page where the user is prompted to enter a password, the attacker has\nembedded a logo, imitating a reputable brand in order to make the page appear like a\nlegitimate login portal. Since the password prompt only appears after some user interaction\n(entering the email address on the first page), this phishing page may be more difficult for\nautomated crawler-based detection engines to detect.\n\nFigure 5. Credential-stealing page built using a popular form builder. Sent in an email with\nthe subject line: “Invoice 071158.”\nFurthermore, we noticed several examples of landing pages that don’t host the credentialstealing forms themselves, but rather contain urgent-sounding language that prompts the\nuser to click on a link or button, which then leads to a different credential-stealing page.\nUsing landing pages in phishing campaigns may increase the number of clicks necessary to\narrive at the credential-stealing page, but the practice has an important benefit: In the event\nthat the final credential-stealing page is taken down, the attacker can simply change the link\nand point to a new credential-stealing page, preserving the effectiveness of the original\ncampaign.\n\nLink-hosting sites are an example of a type of SaaS platform that attackers can abuse to\nhost such landing pages for phishing attacks. These platforms allow users to host links to\ntheir various social media accounts on a single page, giving them the ability to consolidate\ntheir online presence.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs one such link-hosting platform started to gain more popularity in 2021, we observed more\nand more landing pages for phishing attacks being hosted on the platform. (This trend can\nbe seen in Figure 3 by observing the increase in phishing URLs hosted on “Personal\nBranding” platforms starting in the latter half of 2021.) An example of such a landing page is\nshown in Figure 6.\n\nFigure 6. Landing page for a phishing attack created using a popular link-hosting platform,\ndiscovered on Nov. 29, 2021.\n[An article published by Cofense suggests that these more niche platforms may be less](https://cofense.com/threat-actors-use-canva-templates-for-credential-phishing/)\neffective at finding hosted threats, especially compared to sites and tools from popular cloud\nvendors. By utilizing these niche platforms, attackers may be able to put up phishing pages\nthat stay live for a longer period of time.\n\nThis suggests that attackers may try to take advantage of relatively new and less “obvious”\nplatforms when deciding which platforms to use for their phishing attacks. In doing so,\nattackers may be attempting to take advantage of the likelihood that these platforms do not\nhave as many resources dedicated to abuse prevention as the more established and\ngeneral-purpose SaaS platforms do.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAs seen in the case studies shown above, just because a URL is hosted on a seemingly\nlegitimate domain or platform, doesn’t mean that the URL itself is trustworthy. More phishing\nURLs are being hosted on legitimate SaaS platforms, making these phishing pages both\neasier for attackers to create and harder for phishing detection engines to detect.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Since the Palo Alto Networks Advanced URL Filtering service analyzes web content on a](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/advanced-url-filtering)\nURL level (using machine-learning models that study the actual content of the page), Palo\nAlto Networks customers who subscribe to Advanced URL Filtering receive protections from\nthese types of phishing attacks, as well as from other web-based threats.\n\nFor end users, it is crucial to take caution when inputting one’s credentials into any online\ntype of platform. Furthermore, users should be wary of any suspicious emails that use timesensitive language to prompt a user to take some sort of urgent action.\n\nWhen in doubt, users should manually navigate to the relevant login page directly in their\nbrowser (for example, by typing login.microsoftonline.com in the navigation bar), instead of\nclicking any links contained in a potentially deceptive email.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThe author would like to thank Seokkyung Chung, Ziqi Dong, Wei Wang, Jun Javier Wang,\nClaud Xiao, Billy Melicher and Ashraf Aziz for helping gather the data sources used in this\nreport, for curating the list of SaaS platforms and for setting the direction of this research\nreport.\n\n**Get updates from**\n\n**Palo Alto**\n\n**Networks!**\n\nSign up to receive the latest news, cyber threat intelligence and research from us\n\n[By submitting this form, you agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge our Privacy](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/legal-notices/terms-of-use)\nStatement.\n\n\n-----",
