Hive leverages a](https://thehackernews.com/2021/12/new-ransomware-variants-flourish-amid.html)\nvariety of initial compromise methods, including vulnerable RDP servers, compromised VPN\ncredentials, as well as phishing emails with malicious attachments.\n\n[The group also practices the increasingly lucrative scheme of double extortion, wherein the actors](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/ransomware-double-extortion-and-beyond-revil-clop-and-conti)\ngo beyond just encryption by also exfiltrating sensitive victim data and threatening to leak the\ninformation on their Tor site, \"HiveLeaks.\"\n\nAs of October 16, 2021, the Hive RaaS program has victimized at least 355 companies, with the\n[group securing the eighth spot among the top 10 ransomware strains by revenue in 2021,](https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2022-crypto-crime-report-preview-ransomware/)\naccording to blockchain analytics company Chainalysis.\n\nThe malicious activities associated with the group have also prompted the U.S. Federal Bureau of\n[Investigation (FBI) to release a Flash report detailing the attacks' modus operandi, noting how the](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/current-activity/2021/08/27/fbi-releases-indicators-compromise-associated-hive-ransomware)\nransomware terminates processes related to backups, anti-virus, and file copying to facilitate\nencryption.\n\nThe cryptographic vulnerability identified by the researchers concerns the mechanism by which the\nmaster keys are generated and stored, with the ransomware strain only encrypting select portions\n[of the file as opposed to the entire contents using two keystreams derived from the master key.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystream)\n\n\n-----\n\nCyberSecurity\n\n\n\"For each file encryption process, two keystreams from the master key are needed,\" the\nresearchers explained. \"Two keystreams are created by selecting two random offsets from the\nmaster key and extracting 0x100000 bytes (1MiB) and 0x400 bytes (1KiB) from the selected offset,\nrespectively.\"\n\n[The encryption keystream, which is created from an XOR operation of the two keystreams, is then](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR)\nXORed with the data in alternate blocks to generate the encrypted file. But this technique also\nmakes it possible to guess the keystreams and restore the master key, in turn enabling the decode\nof encrypted files sans the attacker's private key.\n\nThe researchers said that they were able to weaponize the flaw to devise a method to reliably\nrecover more than 95% of the keys employed during encryption.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe master key recovered 92% succeeded in decrypting approximately 72% of the files, the\nmaster key restored 96% succeeded in decrypting approximately 82% of the files, and the master\nkey restored 98% succeeded in decrypting approximately 98% of the files,\" the researchers said.\n\nSHARE _�_ _�_ _�_ _�_ __\nSHARE _�_\n\n\n-----",
