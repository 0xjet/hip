The time frame for our research spans between_\n_March 2017 through the present and employs data from the Recorded_\n_Future Platform with open source enrichment. It is intended to provide a_\n_foundation for understanding the relationship between the threat actor(s)_\n_and the broader influences and drivers for activity, as well as augment_\n_existing cybersecurity industry reporting and address established_\n_knowledge gaps in the understanding of UNC1151 and Ghostwriter_\n_activity. This report will be of interest to cybersecurity professionals who_\n_track advanced persistent threat actors as well as those seeking greater_\n_information on UNC1151 and Ghostwriter._\n\n##### Executive Summary\n\nOn November 16, 2021, Mandiant analysts presented\ntheir recent research findings on activity conducted by\nthe cyber threat actor they have designated as UNC1151\nand provided insights into the joint cyber and information\noperations-enabled campaign designated Ghostwriter.\nThe Mandiant team assessed with high confidence\nthat the Belarusian government was responsible for\nUNC1151 activity that primarily targets European entities\nand assessed with moderate confidence that the same\nentity or entities were largely behind the Ghostwriter\ninformation operations activity. Nevertheless, Mandiant\nresearch did not rule out the possibility of potential\nRussian government, or other international, involvement\nin the campaign.\n\nThus far, there has been a lack of technical evidence\nindicating Russian involvement, but this is very likely\nan intended component of the threat activity. We\nhave found many overlaps in tactics, techniques, and\nprocedures (TTPs) used by UNC1151 and Ghostwriter\nactivity and Russian threat activity groups. Additionally,\nwe note that [false flags are prevalent among Russian](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/02/russia-accused-of-false-flag-attack-on-olympic-opening/)\nmilitary advanced persistent threat groups, almost\ncertainly due to their training in the Russian military\ndiscipline of maskirovka, or deception. Such activity\nenables Russian military aligned advanced persistent\nthreat (APT) groups to plan and conduct activity in a way\nthat enables plausible deniability. We also emphasize\nthe widespread presence of the Russian military in\nBelarus, as well as evidence of other Russian high-level\ninfluence and training, which all suggest likely Russian\ninvolvement and influence in Belarus.\n\n\n##### Key Judgments\n\n  - Recorded Future does not dispute findings presented\n\nby Mandiant in November 2021, which suggest technical\nlinks between UNC1151 and Ghostwriter operations and\nthe Belarusian government, likely affiliated with the\nBelarusian military.\n\n  - There is ample evidence to suggest that Russian\n\ngovernment entities, specifically entities within the\nRussian military and academic sector, are likely\ninteracting with the Belarusian government on matters of\ncybersecurity and information confrontation.\n\n  - We have identified reports of high-level meetings\n\nbetween Russian and Belarusian Security Services\nofficials, which indicates that cooperation between the 2\nis likely.\n\n  - It is likely that Russian military entities, potentially\n\nincluding individuals affiliated with Russian Main\nIntelligence Directorate (GRU/GU)-related APT groups,\noperated from, supported, or trained individuals and\norganizations in Belarus; this assessment is based on\nlong-term Russian Ministry of Defense operations in\nBelarus.\n\n  - The interactions between these entities provide the\n\nfoundation necessary for Russian state-affiliated military\nintelligence units to use Belarus as a base of operations\nor train Belarusian personnel in the disciplines of\ninformation warfare and cyber operations.\n\n  - The Ghostwriter campaign, along with the UNC1151\n\nactivity, was composed of concurrent cyber activity\nand information operations; GRU/GU APT groups have\nconsistently engaged in operations that leverage multiple\naspects of the information domain. These groups highly\nlikely have the capability and intent to conduct aspects\nof the Ghostwriter campaign and UNC1151 activity.\n\n  - Russian GRU/GU APT groups have consistently employed\n\nproxies in past operations or engaged in false flag\noperations to mask their involvement in cyber intrusions;\nconducting Ghostwriter/UNC1151 activity from Belarusian\nterritory, or involving Belarusian forces in the effort,\nwould likely offer a similar approach to masking Russian\ninvolvement.\n\n  - The relevance of this research, and the importance\n\nof describing the Russian government involvement in\nBelarusian Ghostwriter and UNC1151 threat activity, is\nthat it reveals how the Russian military can operate from\nforeign territory or leverage proxies to create challenges\nto attribution. The synthesis of technical and contextual\ndata, enabled by the Recorded Future platform, can\nalleviate challenges to attribution.\n\n\n_This research expands on Mandiant’s public attribution of UNC1151_\n_and Ghostwriter activity to entities in Belarus and describes Russian_\n_military organizational influence in Minsk, substantiating a likely nexus_\n_to Russian interests. The time frame for our research spans between_\n_March 2017 through the present and employs data from the Recorded_\n_Future Platform with open source enrichment. It is intended to provide a_\n_foundation for understanding the relationship between the threat actor(s)_\n\n\n-----\n\n_[Figure 1: Overview of UNC1151 targets (left) and APT28 and Sandworm targeting (right) (Source: Mandiant, US Department of Justice, Wired, FireEye, Symantec, and others)](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/unc1151-linked-to-belarus-government)_\n\n\n##### Background\n\nGhostwriter is the designator for an information operations and\ncredential harvesting campaign that has occurred concurrently\nwith likely cyber espionage activity conducted, at least in part,\nby a threat activity group that FireEye designates UNC1151.\nAccording to FireEye, UNC1151 has [engaged in infrastructure](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/unc1151-linked-to-belarus-government)\ndevelopment, credential harvesting, spearphishing, and targeted\nintrusions, and Ghostwriter [activity largely consisted of social](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/espionage-group-unc1151-likely-conducts-ghostwriter-influence-activity)\nmedia and website compromise, as well as the development\nand dissemination of false narratives or forged materials and\ncorrespondence to promote divisive narratives. The primary\ntargets for this activity have been NATO-related entities,\nGerman politicians, interests in the Baltic region (primarily Latvia\nand Lithuania), Ukrainian entities, Polish interests, as well as\nother targets in Colombia, Kuwait, and Ireland. Some of the\nareas subject to the intrusion and influence activity were also\nsubjected to prior efforts conducted by Russian Main Intelligence\nDirectorate (GRU/GU) groups, as shown in Figure 1.\n\nInitial [reporting from Mandiant indicated that narratives](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/ghostwriter-influence-campaign)\npromoted as part of the Ghostwriter campaign aligned with\nRussian security interests. Later [reporting identified Russian](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/espionage-group-unc1151-likely-conducts-ghostwriter-influence-activity)\nlinguistic artifacts within UNC1151 lure document error messages\nand described how UNC1151 spearphishing emails were sent\nfrom Russian email addresses[1]. In March 2021, a German open\n[source report indicated that spearphishing messages, described](https://www.tagesschau.de/investigativ/wdr/hackerangriffe-105.html)\nas part of the Ghostwriter campaign, were sent to 7 members of\nthe Bundestag (the German federal parliament) and more than\n\n1 It is not clear in the original report, which cites a Polish Radio article, what is\nmeant by “Russian email addresses” in this context. It is unclear if this refers to\nemails with a known Russian domain/TLD, MX records linked to known Russian\nemail providers, etc. The original Polish Radio report simply states “wysyłane są z\nrosyjskich adresów e-mail” (sent from Russian email addresses), and can be found\narchived here: https://web.archive[.]org/web/20220106202135/https://www.\npolskieradio24.pl/5/3/Artykul/2003195,Uwaga-na-falszywe-wiadomosci-mailoweOszusci-podszywaja-sie-pod-Polskie-Radio-SA\n\n\n30 members of the state parliament. This report also included\nstatements by the President of the German Federal Office for the\nProtection of the Constitution (BfV), Thomas Haldenwang, who\nindicated to the media that German security authorities suspect\nRussian GRU military intelligence units to be responsible for the\nactivity.\n\nOn November 16, 2021, Mandiant researchers released\na [report and concurrent presentation at CYBERWARCON that](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/unc1151-linked-to-belarus-government)\nassessed “with high confidence that UNC1151 is linked to the\nBelarusian government” and proposed “with moderate confidence\nthat Belarus is also likely at least partially responsible for the\nGhostwriter campaign”. According to their research, “Sensitively\nsourced technical evidence indicates that the operators behind\nUNC1151 are likely located in Minsk, Belarus … In addition,\nseparate technical evidence supports a link between the\noperators behind UNC1151 and the Belarusian military”. Mandiant\nresearchers maintain that this evidence was either validated by\nmultiple sources or directly observed by their team. Furthermore,\nMandiant has asserted that they do not have sufficient evidence\nto confirm or refute any Russian involvement in this campaign.\n\nFollowing this attribution, and on January 14, 2022, threat\nactors likely serving Russian strategic objectives [defaced](https://therecord.media/hackers-deface-ukrainian-government-websites/)\nnearly 70 Ukrainian government websites, including websites\nbelonging to the Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry\nof Defense, the State Emergency Service, Cabinet of Ministers,\nand Ministry of Education and Science. It later became clear\nthat the defacements were merely cover for the WhisperGate\ndisruptive wiping attack. On January 18, Serhiy Demedyuk,\nDeputy Secretary of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense\nCouncil., suggested that the activity may have been conducted\n[by UNC1151 but also noted that the “method of delivery of the](https://therecord.media/a-top-ukrainian-security-official-on-defending-the-nation-against-cyber-attacks/)\nmalware used in this attack is more characteristic of such groups\nas Sandworm, APT28, or APT29”.\n\n\n-----\n\nRecorded Future does not dispute the technical evidence\nprovided by Mandiant in their November reporting or coincident\npresentation and agrees that Belarusian infrastructure or\nresources have likely been employed in the course of this\ncampaign activity. However, we also assess that it is highly\nunlikely that Ghostwriter activity and UNC1151 operations\nare solely a Belarusian government effort. Rather, based on\ncontextual evidence as well as overlaps in timing, methods, and\noperations, it is likely these efforts collectively benefit from\nRussian government support, training, and direction. The aspect\nof direction is crucial, given that Russian government policymakers at the highest levels determine the strategic course of\ntheir intelligence operations and any decision for Russian military\nentities to support, train, or operate from Belarus is likely derived\nfrom the upper echelons of the Russian Ministry of Defense.\n\n##### Threat Analysis\n\nIt is unlikely that UNC1151 and Ghostwriter activity is only\na Belarusian government endeavor. It is likely that Russian\ngovernment entities, potentially affiliated with known GRU\naffiliated Russian APT groups, operated from, trained individuals\nin, leveraged infrastructure located in, or conducted joint\noperations with Belarusian entities engaging in Ghostwriter or\nUNC1151 activity. This assessment takes into consideration\nthe timing and likely capacity for Belarus to solely conduct this\nactivity; the Ghostwriter activity has been ongoing since at\nleast March 2017 but Belarusian cyber operations units were\n[only established in the fall of 2018. Next, because even after the](https://web.archive.org/web/20201125195930/https://www.belta.by/society/view/v-voennoj-akademii-formiruetsja-rota-informatsionnyh-tehnologij-323018-2018/)\nBelarusian cyber operations were established and operational,\nthe teams were likely not large or sophisticated enough to run\nconcurrent information and cyber operations in tandem; Russian\nmilitary cyber and information warfare operators in the GRU,\nhowever, have been engaging in such operations for over a\ndecade and are highly capable in this realm, making it much\nmore likely that either the GRU engaged in the majority of the\nearly UNC1151 and Ghostwriter activity.\n\nIt is highly unlikely that the Belarusian domestic IT sector is\nthe source of the cyber operators supporting the UNC1151 and\nGhostwriter activity; this assessment is based on linguistic data\nas well as contextual information showing that many within the\ndomestic IT sector in Belarus have been actively engaging in\nactivity to oppose the Lukashenko regime.\n\n\nOur analysis consists of 2 main parts. First, we provide context\nfor the relationship between the Russian and Belarusian militaries\nand information security sectors, which is intended to provide\nan understanding of how this relationship likely enabled the\ncapabilities, opportunity, and intent observed in the Ghostwriter\nand UNC1151 threat activity. Second, we provide a comparative\nanalysis between activity conducted by named entities within\nthe existing reporting (Ghostwriter, UNC1151, and Secondary\nInfektion[2]) and efforts historically conducted by Russian threat\ngroups that engage in information and cyber operations. The\ngoal of this analysis is to provide an understanding of why we\nbelieve this activity to have a nexus to known Russian threat\nactivity.\n\n###### Russian and Belarusian Collaborative Activity\n\nSince at least December 1999, Belarus and Russia have been\n[engaged in an effort to develop a “Union State” alliance between](https://macmillan.yale.edu/news/russia-belarus-develop-their-union-state-hold-huge-military-exercise-russia-goes-polls)\nthe 2 countries. Such an alliance consists largely of political,\nmilitary, and economic integration between the 2 nations, while\nalso allowing the Russian government to expand its presence\nand consolidate its influence in Belarus. The development of the\nUnion State between the 2 countries has led to an increase of\nRussian military forces and joint exercises, high-level political\ninfluence, disinformation, and propaganda in Belarus.\n\n###### Military Integration\n\n[Open source reporting from the Centre for Eastern Studies](http://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/148881612.pdf)\n(OSW), a Polish state analytical center based in Warsaw, notes\nthat the Russian and Belarusian militaries have been close allies\nsince the fall of the Soviet Union. Further, Belarus is a member of\nthe Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), which Russia\n[leads. A separate report indicates that the 2 countries](https://www.rferl.org/a/russian-military-creep-in-belarus-raises-security-alarms/30874178.html)\n\n_have an integrated air- and missile-defense_\n_system, plus a regional group of forces_\n_comprised [sic] of four Belarusian brigades and_\n_special forces and the Russian 20th Guards_\n_Army”. Russia leases two military sites: a_\n_strategic ballistic missile defense site operated_\n_by Russian Aerospace Forces in Hantsavichy_\n\n_[the 474th separate radio engineering center_\n_(ORTU)] and the global communications facility_\n_for the Russian navy [the 43rd Communications_\n_Center of the Russian Navy] in Vileyka._\n\n2 Secondary Infektion is a suspected Russian information operation active\nsince at least 2014. Broadly speaking, Secondary Infektion tactics, techniques,\nand procedures (TTPs) rely on forgeries and fake media, principally from false\npersonas, that attempt to enter local sources and penetrate mainstream news.\nThis operation has historically targeted democratic governments and institutions\nabroad with stories intended to generate rage, confusion, and doubt among\nd ti di i th t t d i\n\n\n-----\n\n_[Figure 2: Timeline of Belarus-Russia integration with a focus on Russian military involvement in the region (Sources: FPRI, Bellingcat, USNI, USNews, New York Times,](https://www.fpri.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/rfp3-sivitsky.pdf)_\n_[CyberScoop, Tass, and Associated Press)](https://www.cyberscoop.com/cyber-partisans-belarus-russia-ukraine/)_\n\n\nAccording to an October 20, 2021, Associated Press [report,](https://apnews.com/article/europe-russia-poland-moscow-belarus-103e9ad870bfe10f08e2455da8a517d0)\nRussian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu [traveled to Minsk on](https://bdg.by/news/politics/ministr-oborony-rosiii-sergey-shoygu-pribyl-v-minsk)\nSeptember 16, 2020, to discuss issues relating to bilateral military\ncooperation between Belarus and Russia. The following year,\nShoigu announced the extension of an agreement on the use\nof the aforementioned “2 Russian military facilities in Belarus”\nbelonging to the 43rd Communications Center of the Russian\nNavy and the 474th separate radio engineering center (ORTU).\nThis activity suggests that elements of the Russian military will\nalmost certainly be able to maintain the ability to operate out of\nBelarus for the near term.\n\nBelarus’s Ministry of Defense openly [discusses joint](https://web.archive.org/web/20210505040701/https://www.mil.by/en/military_policy/cooperation_RF/)\ncooperation with the Russian armed forces on its official website,\nnoting that such a partnership occurs bilaterally as part of the\nRusso-Belarusian “Union State” established via the 1999 treaty\nas well as within a multilateral format via the CSTO and the\nCommonwealth of Independent States (CIS).

Russian security affairs analyst Mark Galeotti stated\non August 18 that a Russian special-purpose Tupolev Tu-214VPU\n(high-altitude command post) aircraft from the Rossiya Special\nFlight Squadron traveled from Moscow to Minsk and subsequently\nreturned to the Russian capital on August 18 or 19, 2020. The\naircraft, bearing tail number RA-64523, is typically reserved for\nuse by the head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), a position\ncurrently held by Aleksandr Bortnikov. Although his presence\naboard the plane, and in Minsk, could not be independently\nverified, several media outlets also reported that Bortnikov was\nbelieved to be in Belarus.\n\nAccording to flight [records from FlightRadar24, an aircraft](https://www.flightradar24.com/data/aircraft/ra-64523)\nbearing the tail number RA-64523 and flight number RSD010\ndeparted Moscow’s Vnukovo International Airport (VKO) to Minsk\nNational Airport (MSQ). Early on August 19, the same aircraft,\nalso under flight number RSD010, departed Minsk National\nAirport for Moscow’s Vnukovo Airport, later landing in Moscow.\n[Plane spotting](https://www.airliners.net/photo/Russia-FSB/Tupolev-Tu-214VPU/5497643/L) [websites have also attributed this airframe, with](https://www.planespotters.net/photo/1051633/ra-64523-fsb-federal-security-service-tupolev-tu-214vpu)\nthe same tail number, and what appears to be a long radome on\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3: References to joint cooperation in information security (Source: Recorded Future)_\n\nA November 17, 2021 article by investigative journalist group\nBellingcat on the topic of Russian private military company (PMC)\nWagner activity in Belarus [confirmed that the Tu-214VPU RA-](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2021/11/17/inside-wagnergate-ukraines-brazen-sting-operation-to-snare-russian-mercenaries/)\n64523 traveled from Moscow to Minsk. Additionally, Bellingcat\nindicated that “at least 3 Russian military and/or FSB planes made\npreviously unannounced trips to Minsk in the week following the\nelections, including 2 flights on 12 August”.\n\nThis is not the only visit by high-level Russian government\nofficials, as open source [reporting indicates that on October](https://bdg.by/v-minsk-vnezapno-priletel-glava-vneshney-razvedki-rf-naryshkin)\n22, 2020, director of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service\n(SVR) Sergei Naryshkin traveled to Minsk. According to the\nreport, encrypted chats on Telegram speculated that the\npurpose of the visit was a meeting between Naryshkin and\nBelarusian President Alexander Lukashenko. A separate media\n[report indicated that Naryshkin and Lukashenko discussed joint](https://bdg.by/news/politics/rossiyskie-specsluzhby-gotovy-pomogat-lukashenko)\noperations, notably how the Russian special services could\nsupport Belarus, specifically in matters of common interest. A\nsubsequent meeting between Naryshkin and the Chairman of the\nState Security Committee of the Republic of Belarus (KGB), Ivan\nTertel, was held on June 3, 2021, where the prospect for joint\nwork was again discussed[3], specifically noting that the 2 “agreed\nto conduct joint work to counter the destructive activities of the\nWest”.\n\n###### Disinformation and Propaganda\n\nIn addition to increasing Russian government political and\nmilitary involvement in Belarus, there was a concurrent increase\nin disinformation and propaganda, largely supported by Russian\nstate-sponsored media, in the region. Such an effort likely enabled\nthe Russian government to promote narratives likely intended to\nfoster positive sentiments towards Russia amongst segments of\nthe Belarusian domestic population and thus pave the way for a\nsmoother economic, political, and military integration between\nthe 2 states. The use of such influence operations in the region\nis also indicative of the tenuous relationship between Russia and\nBelarus, an affiliation that at times could be mutually supportive\nbut also antagonistic. For example, Belarusian leadership and\nLukashenko could be amenable to dealing with the Russian\ngovernment but the Belarusian citizens, who often did not\nsupport the Lukashenko regime, were less inclined to support\nsuch affiliations.\n\n3 https://web.archive[.]org/web/20210604105140/http://svr.gov[.]ru/\nsmi/2021/06/na-zashchite-interesov-soyuznogo-gosudarstva.htm\n\n\n[Research reveals that during the period in which the Russian](http://east-center.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Belarus-Disinformation-Propaganda-2019-ENG.pdf)\n[government applied pressure to Belarus to further integrate their](https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2018-12-14/russia-puts-pressure-belarus)\neconomic, political, and military structures, specifically between\n2017 and 2019, “The number of online resources which regularly\npublish items related to Belarus and contain disinformation,\npropaganda narratives and hate speech [had] increased”.\n[Additionally, “A fully-fledged coordinated network of regional](http://east-center.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Belarus-Disinformation-Propaganda-2019-ENG.pdf)\nonline portals with regular publications containing hate speech\nagainst various social, political, religious, and professional\ngroups of the Belarusian population began its activity in 2018”.\nOrganizers of the sites promoting such speech frequently\npromoted the development of a Union State, and some had\nindirect links to the Russian Embassy in Belarus. A separate\nresearch study [indicated that around this same period “60%](https://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/publications/research/2018-11-08-civil-society-russia-threat-ukraine-belarus-moldova-boulegue-lutsevych-marin.pdf)\nof programming broadcast by TV channels available in Belarus\n[consists of content produced in Russia”.

Information confrontation\nis a Russian military term that [describes how to engage in](https://stratcomcoe.org/publications/download/Nato-Cyber-Report_15-06-2021.pdf)\nconflict across several domains within the information space\nthat governs, at a minimum, strategic approaches to information\noperations (IO), cyber activity, psychological operations, and\nelectronic warfare (EW). Such efforts by the Russian military and\nintelligence/security apparatus are not only conducted in times\nof open conflict between states, but also occur persistently,\ntargeting both military and non-military targets in an attempt to\naid Russian forces in maintaining a favorable position in relation\nto other nations.\n\nAvdonin further said, “Simultaneous information confrontation\nis essential because the combined application of force and arms\nagainst other states is already an extreme measure. Right now the\nmain goal of our opponents is the control of the consciousness\nof citizens through various communications channels”. He also\nsuggests that NATO is engaging in the effort to control citizens\nwithin post-Soviet states by undermining citizens’ confidence in\nthe state, discrediting the authorities, and transferring protest\nsentiment to the streets.\n\nAnother report by Rossaprimavera, a pro-Kremlin news\n[outlet, published a report dated February 28, 2020, that carried](https://web.archive.org/web/20211118013448/https://rossaprimavera.ru/news/9f0a66fd)\nmuch of the same material as the February 26 Belta report. The\nRossaprimavera report echoed the statement issued by Alexey\nAvdonin, suggesting that Belarus and Russia engage together on\ninformation confrontation efforts against their opponents. Taken\ntogether, this activity suggests that Avdonin is resurrecting fears\nbased on Kremlin perceptions, and that these comments are\nbeing disseminated to both Belarusian- and Russian-speaking\npopulations in a likely effort to undermine domestic confidence\nin foreign institutions, delegitimize the protest movement, and\nnormalize the population to the need to engage in information\nwarfare against oppositional forces.\n\nConcerns relating to NATO or “the West” supporting\nrevolutionary sentiments in the post-Soviet territories are an\nintrinsically Russian issue. Keir Giles’ The Handbook of Russian\nInformation Warfare states, “Whether based on a realistic current\nthreat appreciation or not, Russia’s perception is that information\ncampaigns in the broadest sense pose a serious and growing\nthreat to the country, implemented and perfected by the United\nStates and the West in the course of a series of regime change\noperations over decades”, noting that these were included\namong “non-military threats” by then-Chief of General Staff\nYuriy Baluyevsky. These threats are enumerated as follows:\n\n\n_Based on the experience of the collapse of_\n_the Soviet Union and of Yugoslavia, and on the_\n_examples of the colour revolutions in Georgia,_\n_Ukraine, Kyrgyzstan, and elsewhere, one can_\n_clearly see that major threats do objectively_\n_exist and are implemented not only by military_\n_means, but primarily by covert and overt_\n_methods of political and diplomatic, economic,_\n_and information influence, various subversive_\n_actions and interference in the internal affairs_\n_of other countries. In this regard, Russian_\n_security interests require not only to assess_\n_these threats but also to determine appropriate_\n_measures to respond to them._\n\nIn addition to these statements, Recorded Future identified\ndocumentation from the 26th Applied Science Conference\non Comprehensive Information Defense held from May 25\nthrough May 27, 2021, in Minsk, attended by a number of\nprofessionals and delegates from the Russian Federation. One\nof the attendees, Dr. Vitalii Robertovich Grigorev, is the Head\nof the Information Confrontation Department at Mirea Russian\nTechnological University, according[4] to the official university\nwebsite. Additionally, Grigorev was on the committee[5] of the\n“9th Russian Scientific Conference on Intelligent Systems and\nInformation Confrontation”, held in February 2020 and organized\nby Mirea Russian Technological University.\n\nGrigoriev not only focuses on academic issues and\nparticipates in educational conferences but also engages in\npolitical and security affairs. Grigoriev was a keynote speaker at\nthe June 21, 2017 Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO)\n[meeting on “The role of the CSTO in strengthening collective](https://web.archive.org/web/20211229041254/https://old.odkb-csto.org/association/news/detail.php?ELEMENT_ID=9812)\nsecurity in the face of growing threats of hybrid war”; Grigoriev’s\ntopic of discussion at the 2017 CSTO meeting was titled “The\nRole of the Internet’s Virtual Social Resources in Real Hybrid\n[Wars”. Grigorev is also listed as one of the founders of the “Fund](https://web.archive.org/web/20211229165857/https://www.list-org.com/company/5417686)\nto Support Employees of the Zaslon Special Services and their\nFamily Members”. Zaslon was described by one open source\n[article as “a special forces unit for the SVR ([Russian] Foreign](https://www.businessinsider.com/russian-zaslon-special-operations-2013-5)\nIntelligence Service) … [t]rained to operate abroad, in everything\nfrom hostage rescue to assassination missions”.\n\n4 https://web.archive[.]org/web/20211113091211/https://www.mirea[.]ru/\neducation/the-institutes-and-faculties/institute-for-integrated-security-andspecial-instrumentation/the-structure-of-the-institute/department-of-kb-8information-warfare/\n5 https://web.archive[.]org/web/20211211061102/http://analyticswar[.]\nru/p%D1%81ommittee/\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4: Timeline Revealing UNC1151’s malware use as well as overarching Ghostwriter activity (Source: Recorded Future)_\n\n\n###### UNC1511/Ghostwriter Campaign Activity Versus Historical Russian APT Efforts and Belarusian Interests\n\n Evaluating Mandiant’s Findings\n\n**_Examining Overlaps With Respect to Past Russian Threat_**\n\n**_Activity_**\n\nIn their most recent report linking UNC1151 and Ghostwriter\nto the Belarusian government Mandiant maintains that “there\nhave been no overlaps [between the Ghostwriter campaign and\nUNC1151 activity and] other tracked Russian groups, including\nAPT28, APT29, Turla, Sandworm, and TEMP.Armageddon”. In\n[support of this, Mandiant indicates the following points:](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/unc1151-linked-to-belarus-government)\n\n  - “Sandworm Team has conducted significant credential\n\ntheft operations during the time UNC1151 has been\nactive, but the techniques used have been distinct. While\nUNC1151 primarily sent phishes impersonating security\nnotices, Sandworm team has leveraged watering holes\ndesigned to redirect users to spoofed login websites.\n\n  - “TEMP.Armageddon has conducted extensive targeting\n\nof multiple Ukrainian entities during the time UNC1151\nhas been actively targeting Ukraine. The 2 groups appear\nto act without knowledge of the other and do not share\nany malware, infrastructure, or other resources.\n\n  - “We continue to assess that Ghostwriter activity is\n\ndistinct from other information operations campaigns\nsuch as Secondary Infektion.\"\n\n\n\n  - “Since 2017, UNC1151 operations have leveraged evolving\n\nbut contiguous TTPs. This evolution is consistent with\nthe maturation of a single organization, and we have not\nuncovered any evidence of a discontinuity in operators.”\n\n**_Overlaps With Historical Sandworm TTPs_**\n\nAlthough Mandiant has indicated that Sandworm and\nUNC1151 employed different techniques in relation to credential\nharvesting activity during approximately the same time, there\nare overlaps in high-level TTPs. Specifically, by looking at\nhistorical operations conducted by Sandworm, it is possible to\nsee general similarities between some of the high-level TTPs\nused by UNC1151. Sandworm has historically leveraged several\ntechniques in relation to spearphishing operations that have been\ndescribed within the UNC1151/Ghostwriter campaign activity.\nAdditionally, the use of false flag operations in concert with\nmalware campaigns to subvert responsibility may be a feature\nat play in the UNC1151/Ghostwriter campaign activity.\n\nAn October 2020 US Department of Justice [indictment](https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1328521/download)\nagainst Sandworm operators indicates that the group employed\nMITRE ATT&CK Subtechnique T1566.001, “Spear Phishing with\nMalicious Attachments”, in their activity targeting credentials for\naccess into 3 energy distribution companies in Ukraine in late\nspring 2015. This aligns with UNC1151 activity since 2017, in\nwhich the threat group employed spearphishing with malicious\nattachments to harvest credentials from targeted entities.\nFurthermore, there are tentative indications that suggest\nUNC1151 may have used spoofed login websites in a credential\n[harvesting operation as Cyjax reported on September 16, 2021,](https://www.cyjax.com/2021/09/16/emea-and-apac-governments-targeted-in-widespread-credential-harvesting-campaign/)\nsimilar to the aforementioned Sandworm activity.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn another technique overlap, and also in the [indictment,](https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1328521/download)\nthe Department of Justice describes how later in October 2016,\nSandworm targeted Ukraine’s State Treasury Service with\nmalware enabled via macros (MITRE ATT&CK Subtechnique\nT1137.001), a technique also noted in UNC1151’s February 2020\nlikely targeting of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine, according to\n[Mandiant’s reporting from April 2021. This technique is employed](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/espionage-group-unc1151-likely-conducts-ghostwriter-influence-activity)\nby a number of groups and not specific to Sandworm. However,\nit is notable that there are several areas in which we see these\noverlaps with GRU-related groups like Sandworm and APT28\narise.\n\nIn an April 28, 2021 report, FireEye indicated that the\nfollowing MITRE ATT&CK tactics, techniques, and procedures\n(TTPs) were affiliated with UNC1151. We have identified several,\nbroad overlaps in these TTPs between and other known GRU\nrelated threat activity groups.\n\n  - T1547.001: Achieving persistence by adding a program to\n\na startup folder or referencing it with a Registry run key.\nThis is a common tactic as threat activity groups across\nthe spectrum employ this approach for persistence,\n[including APT28, as reported in this December 2020](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/20/l/pawn-storm-lack-of-sophistication-as-a-strategy.html)\nTrend Micro report.\n\n  - T1218.005: Mshta, a utility that executes Microsoft HTML\n\nApplications (HTA) files. APT28 employed mshta in the\nWindows post-exploitation framework and penetration\ntesting tool Koadic in 2018, as indicated in this Palo Alto\n[report.](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-sofacy-groups-parallel-attacks/)\n\n  - T1059.005: Employing Visual Basic Scripting (VBS) for\n\nexecution. While this technique, like the use of Registry\nRun Keys, is very common, it is another area in which\noverlap occurs with several Russian advanced persistent\nthreat groups, including those affiliated with the GRU like\n[Sandworm. Both Dragos and ESET (1, 2, 3) have detailed](https://www.dragos.com/wp-content/uploads/CRASHOVERRIDE2018.pdf)\nSandrworm’s use of VBS scripts since at least 2015.\n\n  - T1071: Application Layer Protocol. No overlaps have\n\nbeen found with GRU-related threat actors; however, it\nis notable that Russian APT Dragonfly has employed this\ntechnique when targeting the energy and other critical\ninfrastructure sectors, as indicated in this Cybersecurity\n[and Infrastructure Agency (CISA) alert.](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/TA18-074A)\n\n\n\n- T1105: The transfer of tools from an actor-controlled\n\nsystem to a compromised host, or “Ingress Tool Transfer”,\nis a technique common to many threat activity groups.\nNotably, however, APT28 has also employed this in their\noperations, as noted by a July 2021 joint Cyber Security\n[Advisory by the National Security Agency (NSA), CISA,](https://media.defense.gov/2021/Jul/01/2002753896/-1/-1/1/CSA_GRU_GLOBAL_BRUTE_FORCE_CAMPAIGN_UOO158036-21.PDF)\nFederal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and National\nCyber Security Center (NCSC). Additionally, according\nto an October 2020 Department of Justice (DoJ)\n[Indictment Sandworm also remotely installed additional](https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1328521/download)\ntools on compromised hosts in 2017 when targeting an\ninformation technology company.\n\n- T1140: The use of obfuscation and deobfuscation or\n\ndecoding encrypted files or information in intrusion\nactivity is another technique highly common to many APT\ngroups. We note that, according to a June 2018 Palo Alto\n[report, APT28 used obfuscation techniques in February](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-sofacy-groups-parallel-attacks/)\n2018 to evade detection and Sandworm employed\nobfuscation in their malware in January 2016 as ESET\n[reported in December 2016.](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2016/12/13/rise-telebots-analyzing-disruptive-killdisk-attacks/)\n\n- T1056: Input Capture. Both APT28 and Sandworm employ\n\nthe keylogging sub-technique T1056.001 of input capture\n[in their operations. A July 2018 indictment and Trend](https://www.justice.gov/file/1080281/download)\n[Micro report notes the APT28 use of this technique and](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/20/l/pawn-storm-lack-of-sophistication-as-a-strategy.html)\n[an ESET report describes Sandworm’s use of key logging.](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2016/12/13/rise-telebots-analyzing-disruptive-killdisk-attacks/)\n\n- T1059.001: Command and Scripting Interpreter:\n\nPowerShell. This tactic is also widely used by many\nthreat activity groups. Inclusive of the GRU affiliated\ngroups using PowerShell commands and scripts for\nexecution are both APT28 and Sandworm. APT28’s use of\nPowershell scripting is called out in the aforementioned\n[December 2020 Trend Micro report as well as the July](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/20/l/pawn-storm-lack-of-sophistication-as-a-strategy.html)\n[2021 joint Cyber Security Advisory. Sandworm’s use](https://media.defense.gov/2021/Jul/01/2002753896/-1/-1/1/CSA_GRU_GLOBAL_BRUTE_FORCE_CAMPAIGN_UOO158036-21.PDF)\nof Powershell scripting was noted in an October 2018\n[Dragos’ report as well as the previously referenced](https://www.dragos.com/wp-content/uploads/CRASHOVERRIDE2018.pdf)\n[October 2020 DoJ Indictment against operators from this](https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1328521/download)\nthreat group.\n\n- T1059.007: Command and Scripting Interpreter:\n\nJavaScript. No overlaps found with GRU related threat\nactors however it is notable that Russian APT Turla\nhas employed JavaScript backdoors, as described by a\n[January 2018 report.](https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/ESET_Turla_Mosquito.pdf)\n\n- T1559.002: The use of Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) to\n\nexecute arbitrary commands has been used by APT28\n[according to a McAfee November 2017 report as well as](https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/apt28-threat-group-adopts-dde-technique-nyc-attack-theme-in-latest-campaign/)\n[the previously discussed June 2018 Palo Alto report.](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-sofacy-groups-parallel-attacks/)\n\n\n-----\n\nFinally, Sandworm attempted engage in a false-flag operation\nduring the February 2018 Olympic Destroyer attacks [targeting](https://www.wired.com/story/untold-story-2018-olympics-destroyer-cyberattack/)\nthe PyeongChang Winter Olympics Opening Ceremony; at that\ntime, Sandworm attempted to “mimic the malware of other\nhacking groups-including the Lazarus Group, a state-sponsored\nhacking team in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea” to\ndivert attention from Russian attribution. Given that this group\nhas employed high-level techniques and tactics such as these,\nwhich broadly overlap with UNC1151/Ghostwriter activity, and\ntaking into account that Sandworm is known for conducting false\nflag operations, it is well within the realm of possibility that the\nefforts attributed to Belarus may have a nexus to this, or other,\nRussian APT groups.\n\n**_Overlaps With Historical APT28 TTPs_**\n\nIn addition to the described high-level overlaps between\nUNC1151/Ghostwriter campaign activity and historical Sandworm\nefforts, there are also general associations between this effort\nand historical APT28 activity, specifically around the targeting of\nNATO and concurrent information and cyber operations.\n\nAccording to a June 2021 NATO Strategic Communications\n[Centre of Excellence report, APT28 has targeted NATO since at](https://stratcomcoe.org/publications/download/Nato-Cyber-Report_15-06-2021.pdf)\nleast 2004. The report suggests an element of timing and media\nmessaging associating Russian interests with the Ghostwriter\ncampaign, stating “The timing of ‘Ghostwriter’ coincides with\nthe arrival of NATO troops in the Baltics and Poland as part of\nits Enhanced Forward Presence (eFP). The incoming troops were\ntargeted by intense disinformation campaigns in Russian media\nand on social media”. This activity is similar to historical APT28\nactivity dating back to at least 2014 when one open source\n[report revealed that the group had “set up a fake website on the](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/29/russian-hacker-group-cyber-attacks-apt28)\nBaltic Host logistical planning exercises, which are hosted by one\nof the three Baltic States — Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania — and\ncoincided with training programmes carried out by the US Army\nand NATO forces [in 2014]”.\n\n**_Overlaps With Historical Russian Information Operations_**\n\n**_TTPs_**\n\nRecorded Future believes that [Secondary Infektion, as](https://www.recordedfuture.com/secondary-infektion-targeting-democratic-institutions/)\nwell as the Ghostwriter campaign, are 2 aspects of information\noperations consistent with Russian “active measures”[6], an\napproach to psychological and narrative warfare developed\nduring the Soviet era that is almost certainly still practiced\ntoday by Russian government security service operatives as\nwell as Russian private sector contractors, such as the Internet\nResearch Agency (IRA, or Lakhta Internet Research, LIR).\n\n6 Rus: Активное Мероприятие\n\n\nWe believe that Ghostwriter is a closely related, near-parallel\ninformation operation to Secondary Infektion, but continue to\nassess that Secondary Infektion is a broadly defined family of\nActive Measures campaigns, which include conventional forgeries\nplanted in low-tier sources and forgeries planted through novel\nintrusion means (such as Ghostwriter). Both what has been\nobserved as Secondary Infektion (non-cyber threat activity, with\nthe exception of the 2019 NHS leaks), and Ghostwriter, each\nshare common themes and content dissemination, most notably\nin historical campaigns targeting NATO and sensitively sourced\nintelligence more recently indicating active Secondary Infektion\noperations against the Belarus/Lithuania migrant crisis. With the\nexception of intrusion activity, we have observed overlaps in the\ninformation operations TTPs of both activity sets in a few cases,\nnamely the use of multiple-use, established personas in a few\nselect examples, as well as passive emulation of real individuals.\n\n[According to Mandiant’s prior reporting from July 29, 2020,](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/ghostwriter-influence-campaign)\nthe Ghostwriter campaign had been ongoing since at least\nMarch 2017 and “operations have primarily targeted audiences\nin Lithuania, Latvia, and Poland with narratives critical of the\nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization’s (NATO) presence in Eastern\nEurope, occasionally leveraging other themes such as anti-US\nand COVID-19-related narratives as part of this broader anti[NATO agenda”. Relevantly, Belarus has engaged with NATO on](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_49119.htm)\na bilateral basis under the Partnership for Peace (PfP) program\nsince 1995 and as recently as 2018 hosted joint discussions with\nNATO on regional and international security issues, suggesting it\nwould be unlikely that a Belarusian threat actor would conduct\ninformation operations against the organization at this time.\nHowever, NATO, and the aforementioned themes inherent in the\nGhostwriter campaign, are consistent with longstanding Russian\nthreat activity.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### The Role of the Information Technology and Military Sectors in Belarus\n\n**_The IT Sector’s Role in the Opposition Movement_**\n\nWithin Mandiant’s attribution of the UNC1151/Ghostwriter\ncampaign activity to Belarus is the claim that the Belarusian\ngovernment’s cyber capabilities are supported by an experienced\npool of professionals domestically. However, the Belarusian\n[domestic information technology sector has publicly spoken out](https://web.archive.org/web/20211125223948/https://dev.by/news/otkrytoe-pismo-it-kompanii)\nagainst the actions of the Lukashenko government post-election\n[and has supported opposition efforts. An October 12, 2021 report](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/blog-post/belarusian-it-sector-crucial-actor-fight-against-lukashenko-regime)\nfrom the Wilson Center notes that “In the pre-electoral period\nof June–August 2020, a group of IT professionals developed the\nonline platform Golas (Voice) as an alternative vote counting\nmechanism”. Following the election, on September 8, 2020,\n[the Bell wrote that, “The country’s IT sector … has traditionally](https://thebell.io/en/the-future-of-belarus-it-sector-hangs-in-balance-amid-protests/)\nkept out of politics, but they are now openly supporting the\nopposition”. Additionally, since September 2020, hacktivists\ncalling themselves the Cyber Partisans[7] engaged in website\ndefacements, attacks against Belarusian government resources,\nand data leaks aimed at exposing abuses by the Belarusian\ngovernment. The group is [reportedly composed of “An army](https://www.thedailybeast.com/belarus-hi-tech-park-turns-on-its-creator-as-hackers-lead-revolution-against-lukashenko)\nof 30,000 tech-savvy professionals … Coders and software\nengineers, many of whom are linked to the state-sponsored HiTech Park in Minsk”.\n\n**_Belarusian Military Cyber Operations Program_**\n\nMandiant indicated the Belarusian military was likely\nassociated with UNC1151 activity, pointing to the formation of a\nmilitary IT company in 2018. Insikt Group’s research has validated\nthe creation of a unit focused on conducting cybersecurity-related\n[operations in an article titled “В Военной академии формируется](https://web.archive.org/web/20201125195930/https://www.belta.by/society/view/v-voennoj-akademii-formiruetsja-rota-informatsionnyh-tehnologij-323018-2018/)\nрота информационных технологий” or “At a Military Academy\na [Military] Company for Information Technologies was Formed”\nreported by the Belarusian state-owned media outlet Belta. In\nthe article, Defense Minister Andrei Ravkov announced that in\nNovember 2018, and within the course of the next conscription\neffort, a company-level unit would be formed that would focus\nspecifically on information technologies. The article quotes\nRadkov as stating that information technologies are just a part\nof a number of scientific-technological developments used in\nthe modern military, and the potential of the Belarusian military\nis immense, and therefore the goal would be to create a military\nacademy to train these soldiers for these IT units. A follow on\n[report in Belta from February 22, 2019, indicated that 40 people](https://web.archive.org/web/20211026225210/https://www.belta.by/society/view/reportazh-it-rota-kak-sluzhitsja-pervomu-prizyvu-novogo-podrazdelenija-337636-2019/)\nwere recruited to serve in the newly formed unit during the\nautumn of 2018 and that another 20 would be added on in the\nspring of 2019. According to the article, the military personnel\n\n7 Rus: Кибер Партизаны\n\n\nwould work with universities as well as other scientific and\neducational institutions to develop software as well as “special\nand applied programs”. The report also indicated that the training\nat the academy could be applicable for later employment at the\nHi-Tech Park in Minsk but provided no definitive link between\nthe Military Academy and the professional domestic IT sector.\n\n###### Broader Assessments\n\n[A statement by the German Foreign Office in the government](https://web.archive.org/web/20211215225040/https://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/de/newsroom/regierungspressekonferenz/2480282)\nprovided in a Press Conference from September 6, 2021 in which\nthe government spokesperson indicated that attribution for this\nactivity is as follows:\n\n_The Federal Government has reliable knowledge_\n_on the basis of which the “Ghostwriter”_\n_activities can be assigned to cyber actors_\n_of the Russian state and specifically to the_\n_Russian military intelligence service GRU. The_\n_Federal Government regards this unacceptable_\n_approach as a threat to the security of the_\n_Federal Republic of Germany as well as to the_\n_democratic decision-making process and a_\n_heavy burden for bilateral relations. The German_\n_government urges the Russian government_\n_to stop these illegal cyber activities with_\n_immediate effect._\n\nFollowing this announcement, on November 17, 2021, Dr.\nThomas Rid, Professor of Strategic Studies at Johns Hopkins\nUniversity School of Advanced International Studies indicated\nthat “[The] German gov stands by its assessment, adds: The\nattribution made by them doesn’t rule out other groups having\nparticipated as well”.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Outlook\n\nIn this research, we have laid out extensive indicators of\nlikely Russian and Belarusian cooperation, including high-level\nmeetings, cyberwarfare training, and public statements. Although\nwe may not have direct visibility into the inner workings of the\nmilitary intelligence cooperation between the two countries, we\nhave explained the mechanisms that laid the foundation for it as\nwell as the avenues by which it is likely occurring. Additionally,\nwe have detailed the manner in which such cooperation is\nmutually beneficial, as the activity allows Belarus to improve its\ntechnological capabilities in the information warfare space while\nallowing Russia the ability to escape culpability for its actions.\n\nTherefore, it is likely that if attribution of UNC1151 and\nGhostwriter is limited to Belarus, it likely benefits Russian statesponsored threat activity groups, given that it provides plausible\ndeniability for their operations. Furthermore, such attribution\nlikely emboldens Russian state-sponsored threat activity groups\nto seek out other similarly hospitable locations to base their\noperations to provide further challenges to attribution. There\nhave already been indications of Russian information operations\n[moving abroad. A shift in cyber operations to friendly or allied](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/mar/13/facebook-uncovers-russian-led-troll-network-based-in-west-africa)\nnations could further grant threat actors plausible deniability.\n\nAlso, a shift of Russian operational activity to Belarus and the\nattribution of UNC1151 and Ghostwriter campaign activity solely\nto Belarus likely risks further alienating Belarus from European\nallies and threatens any long-term viability of engagement with\nNATO through the PfP program. Although this may not be the\noriginal goal in moving the activity to this location, it appears\nto be an added benefit for Russian threat actors seeking to\ndrive a wedge between the nations within the Russian sphere of\ninfluence and NATO and its allies.\n\n\n-----\n\nAbout Insikt Group[®]\n\nRecorded Future’s Insikt Group, the company’s threat research division, comprises\n\nanalysts and security researchers with deep government, law enforcement, military, and\n\nintelligence agency experience.
