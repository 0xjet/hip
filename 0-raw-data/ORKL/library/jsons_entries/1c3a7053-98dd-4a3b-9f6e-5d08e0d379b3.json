Moreover, the quarter has already passed. I thought Drive-by Download attack\nwas dead four years ago. Angler Exploit Kit has disappeared, pseudo-Darkleech and EITest\ncampaign have disappeared, and RIG Exploit Kit has also declined. At that time, Drive-by\n\n\n-----\n\nDownload attack was definitely supposed to die. However, even if in 2021, it will not\ndisappear fire still slightly.\n\nIn April 2021, I received some incredible notices. For example, there are the following\nnotifications.\n\nPurpleFox Exploit Kit has started exploiting CVE-2021-26411\nRIG Exploit Kit has started exploiting CVE-2021-26411\nBottle Exploit Kit is back, and has started exploiting CVE-2020-1380 and CVE-202126411\nUnderminer Exploit Kit is back\n\nRepeat again. It’s 2021 now. Not 2017. Internet Explorer was taken away by Chrome and\nEdge, and Drive-by Download attack was supposed to die. Why are there still Drive-by\nDownload attacks? Here are some reasons, including the opinions of your friends.\n\n1. Internet Explorer is still used in some countries/regions including Japan\n2. Due to the influence of corona, remote work has increased, and the number of users\n\nwith network security vulnerabilities has increased\n3. Internet Explorer vulnerabilities still discovered and exploit code published\n\nIn reality, these are intricately intertwined, and there may be different reasons.\n\nIn any case, Drive-by Download attacks are still being observed. Moreover, it is a little more\nactive. This is irrelevant for most people. Because most people don’t use Internet Explorer. If\nyou don’t use Internet Explorer, a typical Exploit Kit attack is not a threat. A small number of\ntargeted attacks may use Chrome’s 0day, which is not discussed here.\n\nFor the few enthusiastic Internet Explorer users that exist, I write this blog post. In other\nwords, as of April 2021, I will introduce the characteristics of common Drive-by Download\nattacks that you may encounter. Thanks to my friends (@jeromesegura, @nao_sec\nmembers) for helping me write this blog post.\n\n## Exploit Kit Landscape\n\nAs of April 2021, the following 6 types of Exploit Kits have been observed to be active.\n\nRIG\nSpelevo\nPurpleFox\nUnderminer\nBottle\nMagnitude\n\n\n-----\n\nnao_sec has been running a fully automatic Drive-by Download attack observation\nenvironment called Augma System[1] for three years. The data observed by this is as\nfollows. Some Exploit Kits are not counted because they are observed in different\nenvironments.\n\nThe features of the 6 types of Exploit Kits currently observed are as follows.\n\n**Private** **Update** **Exploit**\n\nRIG No Yes CVE-2020-0674, CVE-2021-26411\n\nSpelevo No No CVE-2018-8174, CVE-2018-15982\n\nPurpleFox Yes Yes CVE-2021-26411\n\nUnderminer Yes No CVE-2018-15982\n\nBottle Yes Yes CVE-2020-1380, CVE-2021-26411\n\nMagnitude Yes Yes CVE-2021-26411\n\nHere is sample traffic for each.\n\n### RIG Exploit Kit\n\nRIG is an Exploit Kit that has been active since around 2014. It was extremely active from\n2016 to 2017, but then declined with the advent of Fallout and others. However, it is still\nactive in 2021.\n\n\n-----\n\nRIG started abusing CVE-2021-26411 in April 2021 and are still incorporating changes.\nLanding Pages are not obfuscated as they used to be. Very simple code. The malware is\nRC4 encrypted.\n\nDownload sample traffic [here.](https://nao-sec.org/assets/2021-04-16/rig.saz)\n\n### Spelevo Exploit Kit\n\nSpelevo is an Exploit Kit that appeared in 2019. 2020 was very mature, but 2021 is one of\nthe most active Exploit Kits.\n\nSpelevo hasn’t changed for a long time. Spelevo hides the malware in the image. See this\narticle[2] for detailed behavior.\n\nDownload sample traffic [here.](https://nao-sec.org/assets/2021-04-16/spelevo.saz)\n\n### PurpleFox Exploit Kit\n\nPurpleFox is an Exploit Kit that has been active since 2019. A private exploit kit for sending\nPurpleFox malware. It’s enthusiastic about exploit and is fairly fast at incorporating new\nvulnerabilities.\n\nSpelevo has started to exploit CVE-2021-26411 in April 2021. However, the other parts have\nnot changed for a long time.\n\n\n-----\n\nDownload sample traffic [here.](https://nao-sec.org/assets/2021-04-16/purplefox.saz)\n\n### Underminer Exploit Kit\n\nUnderminer is an Exploit Kit that appeared in 2018. It’s a pretty distinctive Exploit Kit. It is\nknown to be extremely difficult to analyze. It is used to deliver its unique malware called\nHidden Bee. See this article[3] for more details.\n\nUnderminer has a cycle of activity for several months and then silence for several months. It\nhas been silent since the November 2020, but was revived in April 2021. But the essence\nhasn’t changed at all.\n\nDownload sample traffic [here.](https://nao-sec.org/assets/2021-04-16/underminer.saz)\n\n### Bottle Exploit Kit\n\nBottle is an Exploit Kit that appeared in 2019. An extremely rare Exploit Kit that targets only\nJapan. It is used to deliver its unique malware called Cinobi.\n\nIt is one of the most active Exploit Kits in Japan. It has not been observed since November\n2020, but it was revived in April 2021. It’s also worth noting that unlike other Exploit Kits, it\nexploits CVE-2020-1380 and CVE-2021-26411. It has been pointed out that it is related to\nMageCart and phishing campaigns. See this article[4] for more details.\n\n\n-----\n\nDownload sample traffic [here.](https://nao-sec.org/assets/2021-04-16/bottle.saz)\n\n### Magnitude Exploit Kit\n\nMagnitude is one of the oldest existing Exploit Kits. It has been observed only in certain\ncountries/regions such as South Korea and Taiwan, and the details have not been reported\nmuch.\n\nIts activity was also reported in April 2021. It exploits CVE-2021-26411 and is still actively\nevolving.\n\nOne more: [#MagnitudeEK](https://twitter.com/hashtag/MagnitudeEK?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [pic.twitter.com/pOuIZzAPZG](https://t.co/pOuIZzAPZG)\n\n[— Jérôme Segura (@jeromesegura) April 14, 2021](https://twitter.com/jeromesegura/status/1382395637480656896?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n## Finally\n\nDrive-by Download attacks are still observed in 2021. It has nothing to do with most people.\nAs with Adobe Flash Player, stop using Internet Explorer immediately. That is the simplest\nsolution. Drive-by Download attacks continue to exist with Internet Explorer.\n\n## References\n\n[1] https://www.virusbulletin.com/uploads/pdf/conference_slides/2019/VB2019KoikeChubachi.pdf\n\n[2] [https://insight-jp.nttsecurity.com/post/102gsqj/pseudogatespelevo-exploit-kit](https://insight-jp.nttsecurity.com/post/102gsqj/pseudogatespelevo-exploit-kit)\n\n[3] https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2019/08/the-hidden-bee-infection-chainpart-1-the-stegano-pack/\n\n[4] [http://jsac.jpcert.or.jp/archive/2021/pdf/JSAC2021_103_koike-takai_jp.pdf](http://jsac.jpcert.or.jp/archive/2021/pdf/JSAC2021_103_koike-takai_jp.pdf)\n\n\n-----",
