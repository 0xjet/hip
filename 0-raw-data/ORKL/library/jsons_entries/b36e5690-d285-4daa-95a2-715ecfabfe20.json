The threat actor has since resumed its typical activity.\nProofpoint assesses that the threat group distributing Emotet is likely testing new tactics,\ntechniques, and procedures (TTPs) on a small scale before adopting them in broader\ncampaigns or to deploy them in parallel with the broad campaigns.\nThe messages contained OneDrive URLs that hosted a zip archive containing XLL files\ndropping Emotet malware.\nThis activity is attributed to [TA542.](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/threat-actor-profile-ta542-banker-malware-distribution-service)\n\n## Overview\n\n[Emotet is a prolific botnet and](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-reference/botnet) [trojan that targets Windows platforms to distribute follow-on malware. It](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-reference/remote-access-trojan)\nwas considered one of the most prolific cybercriminal threats before its disruption by global law\nenforcement in January 2021.\n\nIn November 2021, 10 months after its disappearance from the threat landscape, Proofpoint\nobserved a reemergence of this notorious botnet, and since then, the group associated with Emotet,\nTA542, has targeted thousands of customers with tens of thousands of messages in multiple\ngeographic regions. In some cases, the message volume reaches over one million per campaign.\n\nHowever, the new activity observed by Proofpoint is a departure from their typical behaviors and\nindicates the group is testing new attack techniques on a small scale before adopting them for larger\nvolume campaigns. Alternatively, these new TTPs may indicate that TA542 may now be engaged in\nmore selective and limited attacks in parallel to the typical massive scale email campaigns.\n\n## Activity Details\n\n\n-----\n\nProofpoint detected a low volume of emails distributing Emotet malware. The sender emails\nappeared to be compromised. The emails were not sent by the Emotet spam module. The subjects\nwere simple and contained one word such as \"Salary\". The email bodies contained only OneDrive\nURLs and no other content. The OneDrive URLs hosted zip files containing Microsoft Excel Add-in\n(XLL) files.\n\nThe zip archives and XLL files used the same lures as the email subjects, such as “Salary_new.zip.”\nThis particular archive contained four copies of the same XLL file with names such as\n“Salary_and_bonuses-04.01.2022.xll”. The XLL files, when executed, drop and run Emotet\nleveraging the Epoch 4 botnet.\n\n_Figure 1: Example OneDrive URL hosting a zip archive_\n\nThe identified activity differs from previously observed Emotet malware campaigns in the following\nways:\n\nThe low-volume nature of the activity. Typically, Emotet distributes high-volume email\ncampaigns to many customers globally, with some campaigns in recent weeks hitting one\nmillion messages total.\nThe use of OneDrive URLs. Typically, Emotet delivers Microsoft Office attachments or URLs\n(hosted on compromised sites) linking to Office files.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe use of XLL files. Typically, Emotet uses Microsoft Excel or Word documents containing\nVBA or XL4 macros. XLLs are a type of dynamic link library (DLL) file for Excel and are\ndesigned to increase the functionality of the application.\n\nNevertheless, Proofpoint analysts attribute this activity with high confidence to threat actor TA542\nbecause since 2014 the actor closely controlled the Emotet malware and is not rented it to other\nactors.\n\n## Additional Context\n\nProofpoint observed the activity at a time when the widespread Emotet malware campaigns were on\npause (a “spring break”) between April 4, 2022, and April 19, 2022. Emotet has since resumed its\nhigh-volume campaigns. Proofpoint researchers assess that while on the break, TA542 continued\ndevelopment and testing of new attack vectors, specifically OneDrive URLs and XLL files, in\npreparation for using them on a wider scale. Alternatively, these new TTPs may indicate that TA542\nmay now be engaged in more selective and limited scale attacks in parallel to the typical mass scale\nemail campaigns.\n\n_Figure 2: Plot of Emotet email volumes since November 2021_\n\nAdditionally, it is notable that TA542 is interested in new techniques that do not rely on macroenabled documents as Microsoft is making it increasingly difficult for threat actors to use macros as\nan infection vector. In February, Microsoft [announced it would begin blocking Visual Basic for](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-blog/helping-users-stay-safe-blocking-internet-macros-by-default-in/ba-p/3071805)\nApplication (VBA) macros obtained from the internet by default in April. This follows Microsoft’s\n[announcement to disable XL4 macros in 2021. Typically, threat actors including TA542 that use](https://therecord.media/microsoft-to-disable-excel-4-0-macros-one-of-the-most-abused-office-features/)\nmacro-enabled attachments rely on social engineering to convince a recipient the content is\ntrustworthy, and enabling macros is necessary to view it.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise (IOC)\n\n\n-----\n\n**Indicator** **Description**\n\nhttps[:]//1drv[.]ms/u/s!AnTRAbuGZ8jie3V-jtcrv7-8xx0 Example URL leading\nto zipped XLL\n\n2da9fa07fef0855b4144b70639be4355507612181f9889960253f61eddaa47aa SHA256\nSalary_new.zip\n\nf83e9f85241d02046504d27a22bfc757ea6ff903e56de0a617c8d32d9f1f8411 SHA256\nSalary_and_bonuses01.01.2022.xll\n\n8ee2296a2dc8f15b374e72c21475216e8d20d4e852509beb3cff9e454f4c28d1 SHA256 Emotet\nPayload\nezesqrmrsbhftab.lft\n\nSubscribe to the Proofpoint Blog\n\n\n-----",
