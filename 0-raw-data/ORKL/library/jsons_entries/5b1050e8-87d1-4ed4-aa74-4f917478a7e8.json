Today I want to share a\n[quick and short study based on cross correlation between MITRE ATT&CK and](https://attack.mitre.org/) [Malpedia](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/)\nabout some of the main threat actors attributed to Iran. The Following sections describe the\nTTPs (Tactics, Techniques and Procedures) used by some of the most influential Iranian APT\ngroups. Each section comes with a main graph which is built by scripting and which comes\nwithout legend, so please keep in mind while reading that: the red circles represent the\nanalyzed threat actors, the green circles represent threat actor’s used techniques, the blue\ncircles represent the threat actor’s used Malware and the black circles represent the threat\nactor’s used tool sets.\n\n## OilRig\n\n\n-----\n\nAccording to Malpedia: OilRig is an Iranian threat group operating primarily in the Middle\nEast by targeting organizations in this region that are in a variety of different industries;\nhowever, this group has occasionally targeted organizations outside of the Middle East as\nwell. It also appears OilRig carries out supply chain attacks, where the threat group\nleverages the trust relationship between organizations to attack their primary targets.” The\n[threat actor uses opensource tools such as Mimikatz and](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz) [laZagne, common sysadmin](https://github.com/AlessandroZ/LaZagne/commits?author=AlessandroZ)\ntoolset available on Microsoft distribution or sysinternals such as: PsExec, CertUtil, Netstat,\nSystemInfo, ipconfig and tasklist. Bonupdater, Helminth, Quadangent and PowRuner are\nsome of the most sophisticated Malware attributed to OilRig and analyzed over the past few\nyears. Techniques (green) are mainly focused in the lateral movements and in getting\npersistence on the victim infrastructure; few of them involved exploiting or 0days initiatives.\n\nOilRig TTP\nThose observations would suggest a powerful group mostly focused on staying hidden rather\nthan getting access through advanced techniques. Indeed no 0days or usage of advanced\nexploits is found over the target infrastructure. If so we are facing a state-sponsored group\nwith high capabilities in developing persistence and hidden communication channels (for\nexample over DNS) but without a deep interest in exploiting services. This topic would rise a\nquestion: OilRig does not need advanced exploiting capabilities because it is such a simple\nway to get into a victim infrastructure ? For example by using: user credential leaks, social\nengineering toolkits, targeted phishing, and so on and so forth or is more on there to be\ndiscovered ?\n\n\n-----\n\n## MuddyWater\n\nAccording to MITRE: “MuddyWater is an Iranian threat group that has primarily targeted\nMiddle Eastern nations, and has also targeted European and North American nations. The\ngroup’s victims are mainly in the telecommunications, government (IT services), and oil\nsectors.” Currently we have few artifacts related to MuddyWater (‘Muddy’), indeed only\nPowerstats backdoor is actually attributed to it. Their attack are typically “hands driven”,\nwhich means they do not use automation lateral movement but they prefer to use\nopensource tools or sysinternal ones to deliberately move between target network rather\nthan running massively exploits or scanners.\n\nMuddyWater TTP\nOnce landed inside a victim machine Muddy looks for local credentials and then moves back\nand forward by using such a credentials directly on the network/domain controllers.\nAccording to MITRE techniques (green) MuddyWater to take an entire target-network might\ntake few months but the accesses are quite silent and well obfuscated. Again it looks like we\nare facing a group which doesn’t need advanced exploitation activities but rather than\nadvanced IT knowledge in order to move between network segments and eventual\nproxies/nat.\n\n## APT33\n\n\n-----\n\nAccording to MITRE: APT33 is a suspected Iranian threat group that has carried out\noperations since at least 2013. The group has targeted organizations across multiple\nindustries in the United States, Saudi Arabia, and South Korea, with a particular interest in\nthe aviation and energy sectors.” Analyzing the observed TTPs we might agree that this\nthreat actor looks very close to MuddyWater. If you take a closer look to the Muddy Graph (in\nthe previous dedicated section) and APT33 graph (following) you will see many similarities:\nmany tools are shared, many techniques are shared and even artifacts Powerstats (Muddy)\nand Powertron (APT33) share functions and a small subset of code (even if they have\ndifferent code bases and differ in functionalities). We have more information about APT33 if\ncompared to MuddyWatter, but similarities on TTPs could induce an avid reader to think that\nwe might consider APT33 as the main threat actor while MuddyWater a specific ‘operation’ of\nthe APT33 actor.\n\nAPT33 TTP\nBut if you wonder why I decided to keep them separated on such personal and preliminary\nanalysis you could find the answer in the reason in why they do attack. APT33 showed\ndestruction intents by using Malware such as shamoon and stoneDrill, while Muddy mostly\nwants to “backdooring” the victims.\n\n## CopyKittens\n\n\n-----\n\nAccording to MITRE: CopyKittens is an Iranian cyber espionage group that has been\noperating since at least 2013. It has targeted countries including Israel, Saudi Arabia, Turkey,\nthe U.S., Jordan, and Germany. The group is responsible for the campaign known as\nOperation Wilted Tulip.” CopyKittens threat actor actually differ from the previous ones. First\nof all we see the usage of CobaltStrike, which is an autonomous exploiting system (well\nactually is much more, but let me simplify it). Cobalt and Empire (a post exploitation\nframework) taken together would allow the attacker to automate lateral movement. Which is\na damn different behavior respect to previous actors. CopyKittens would make much more\nnoise inside an attacked network and would be easier to detect if using such automation\ntools, but on the other hand they would be much more quick in reaching their targets and run\naway.\n\nCopyKittens TTP\n\nOne more characteristic is the “code signing”. While in OilRig, MuddyWater and APT33 we\nmostly observed “scripting” capabilities, in CopyKittens we are observing most advanced\ncode capabilities. Indeed code signing is used on Microsoft Windows and IOS to guarantee\nthat the software comes from known developer and that it has not been tampered with. While\na script (node, python, AutoIt) could be attribute to IT guys as well as developers, developing\nmore robust and complex software ( such as: java, .net, c++, etc) is a skill typically attributed\nto developers. This difference could be significant in suspecting a small set of different\npeople working on CopyKittens.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Cleaver\n\nAccording to MITRE: “Cleaver is a threat group that has been attributed to Iranian actors and\nis responsible for activity tracked as Operation Cleaver. [1] Strong circumstantial evidence\nsuggests Cleaver is linked to Threat Group 2889 (TG-2889). ” We have few information\nabout this group, and as you might see there are few similarities. The usage of Mimikatz\ncould be easily adopted for credential dumping, while TinyZBot is a quite interesting tool\nsince it mostly implements spying capabilities without strong architectural design or code\nexecution or data exfiltration.\n\nCleaver TTP\nJust like Charming **Kitten (which is not included into this report since it is a quite ongoing**\n_mistery even if a great report from_ _[Clear Sky is available), Cleaver is a threat group that is](https://www.clearskysec.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Charming_Kitten_2017.pdf)_\nresponsible of one of the first most advanced and silent cyber attack attributed to Iran known\n[until now (OpCleaver, by Cylance). Cleaver attack capabilities are evolved over time very](https://www.cylance.com/content/dam/cylance/pages/operation-cleaver/Cylance_Operation_Cleaver_Report.pdf)\nquickly and, according to Cylance, active since 2012. They look like to have infiltrated some\n[of the world economic powers (ref: here) such as: Canada, China, England, France,](https://www.cylance.com/operation-cleaver)\nGermany, India, Israel, Kuwait, Mexico, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Turkey,\nUnited Arab Emirates, and the United States. In the very first page of the OpCleaver report,\nthe author writes that Cleaver is one of the most advanced threat actors ever. Even if I might\nagree with Cylance, I personally do not have such evidences so far, so I personally cannot\ncompare Cleaver threat actor to the previus ones.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Threat Actors Comparison\n\nHere comes the fun ! How about taking all these graphs and compare them ? Common\nreferences would highlight similarities, scopes and common TTPs and fortunately we might\nappreciate them in the following unique network diagram. You might spend over 20 minutes\nto check details on the following graph and I might decide to write an essay over it, but I will\nnot do it :D, I’d like focus on few but important thoughts.\n\nThe iper-connection between the analyzed groups (take a look to the following graph)\ncould prove that those teams are really linked together. They share Techniques, Procedures,\nTools and Infection Artifacts and everything we might observe looks like belonging with a\nunique meta-actor. We might agree that the meta-actor would be linked to the sponsorship\nnation and we might decide to consider some of those groups as operations. In other words\nwe might consider an unique group of people that teams up depending of the ongoing\noperation adopting similar capabilities and tool sets.\n\nThreat Actor Comparison\nOilRig and APT33 are the most known groups attributed to Iran, they share many tools but\nthey clearly have two different intent and two different code bases (writing about Malware).\nCopyKittens, for example, have been clustered more closed to APT33 while Muddywater\nlooks like clustered straight at the middle of them. But if we closely analyze the purposes and\n\n\n-----\n\nthe used Malware we might agree in aggregating Muddy close to APT33, actually the weight\nof shared code should be heavier compared to common tools or common techniques, but I\ndid not represent such a detail into graphs.\n\nHowever two different ‘code experience’ are observed. The first one mostly focused on\nscriptting (node, python, autoIT) which could underline a group of people evolving from IT\ndepartment and later-on acquiring cyersecurity skills, while the second observed behavior is\nmostly oriented on deep development skills such as for example: Java, .NET and C++. On\nMuddyWater and APT33 side, the usage of scripting engines, the usage of powershell, and\nthe usage of Empire framework tighten together, plus the lack of exploiting capabilities or the\nlack in developing sophisticated Malware could bring the analyst to think that those threat\nactors hit their target without the need of strong development capabilities. On the other hand\nOilRig, Cleaver and CopyKitten looks like to have more software developing skills and looks\nto be mostly focused on stealth operations.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this post I wrote a preliminary and personal analysis of threat actors attributed by the\ncommunity to Iran, comparing TTPs coming from MITRE and relations extracted from\nMalpedia. The outcome is a proposal to consider the numerous groups (OilRig, APT33,\nMuddyWater, Cleaver, etc..) as a primary meta-threat-actor and dividing them by operations\nrather real group.\n\n\n-----",
