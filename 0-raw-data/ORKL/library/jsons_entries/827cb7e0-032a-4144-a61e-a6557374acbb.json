    "plain_text": "# A Sticky Situation Part 2￼\n\n**[domaintools.com/resources/blog/a-sticky-situation-part-2](https://www.domaintools.com/resources/blog/a-sticky-situation-part-2)**\n\n\nAugust 18, 2022\n\n\n-----\n\nIn May 2022, [we reported on the Caramel skimmer-as-a-service and how the proliferation of](https://www.domaintools.com/resources/blog/a-sticky-situation-part-1-the-pervasive-nature-of-credit-card-skimmers)\nonline credit card skimmers support fraud. Evidence suggests CaramelCorp, the group\nbehind the Caramel skimmer, does not limit their cybercrime activities to skimming. Instead,\nthis group appears to pivot frequently in search of profitable new lines of business using\ndifferent aliases with a documented history spanning several years. Such behavior is not\nunusual; rather, this appears to be a trend where cybercriminals are quicker to adapt–and\nexpand to offer new services–in response to market forces.\n\nSeveral factors contribute to this trend, but three are especially pertinent to this investigation.\nFirst, cybercrime threat actors can (temporarily) avoid scrutiny from law enforcement by\nappearing to be a small operation–a target simply not worth the effort to address, given the\nsignificant increase in cybercrime and limited resources available to deter such behavior. A\ncybercrime group that convincingly “appears small” can realize rich dividends. Second, savvy\ncybercrime threat actors closely monitor the underground economy and evaluate new\nopportunities in response to market forces. Third, increased specialization and reliance on\nthird party services within the underground economy makes expanding into new types of\ncybercrime economical with minimal learning curve. The potential harm this trend can cause\nfor business and consumer alike should not be discounted, nor should adversary creativity or\ntheir willingness to pivot in search of profits.\n\nDespite its upside, such a trend is not without additional risk for cybercriminals. In exchange\nfor additional capabilities and revenue, cybercrime actors often increase exposure. One\nhelpful way to understand this relationship is through the lens of network defense and to\nconsider exposure in terms of attack surface: increased complexity and reliance on third\nparty services creates risk. If realized, that risk can become exploitable. Such is the case\nwith CaramelCorp, and these footholds help bring into focus a cluster of activity beyond\nselling access to an online credit card skimmer. Instead, a portrait of a more ambitious group\nwith forays into stealer malware, dubious video game “hacks,” and cryptocurrency scams\nbegins to appear.\n\n## Domain Registrant “Ozil Verfig” and a Trail of Badness\n\nThe seeming simplicity of whois data belies immense complexity. Relationships between\nregistrant data and how domains relate can offer helpful insights when used judiciously.\nCommonality – whether infrastructure or artifact – does not necessarily mean association or\nshared endeavor. Not all roads lead to Rome and not all threads of an investigation lead to\nthe same suspect or conclusion. The art of threat intelligence is the ability to see multum in\n_parvo (“much in little”) without losing sight of the big picture. To do so is to be comfortable_\nwith ambiguity, something cybercrime investigations are often fraught with. The domains in\nCaramelCorp’s orbit and how they overlap with the domain registrant “Ozil Verfig” typify this\n“big picture” approach.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn this case, several roads lead to CaramelCorp. Whois records for caramelcorp[.]cc offer\nseveral useful initial footholds, the most helpful being:\n\nRegistrant Name: Ozil Verfig\n\nRegistrant Organization: Ozil Verfig\n\nRegistrant Street: Krasnaya Ploshad\n\nRegistrant City: Moscow\n\nRegistrant Postal Code: 101000\n\nRegistrant Country: RU\n\nRegistrant Phone: +495.1234321\n\n[Registrant Fax: +495.1234321Registrant Email: [email protected][.]com](https://www.domaintools.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)\n\nNotably, the caramelcorp[.]cc domain appears to be controlled by a single registrant for its\nentire history. The registrant organization name “Ozil Verfig ” and email address\n[“[email protected][.]com” seem distinctive. Further, the OSINT footprint associated with this](https://www.domaintools.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)\nregistrant is narrow but deep.\n\nA review of caramelcorp[.]xyz, one of CaramelCorp’s earlier domains, also has “Ozil Verfig”\nlisted as the domain registrant’s organization. The name “Ozil Verfig” is unusual. Thus, the\nrelatively small footprint of domains with registrants and registrant organizations using the\nname suggest relatedness. Further, many of these domains appear to fall into three\ncategories: (1) impersonation of financial institutions, (2) cryptocurrency scams, and (3)\nmalware domains, whether for propagation or administration (with possible ties to a notable\nRedline stealer campaign). Given the cybercrime nexus, distinctive name, targeting behavior,\nand frequently used domain registrars, it appears more likely than not that a single threat\nactor or group is behind these domain registrations. Another factor to consider is whether\nany similar domain naming conventions exist.\n\nRegistrant “Ozil Verfig” domains follow several consistent naming conventions for several\nlikely domain purpose groups. Some of these domains include:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nDomain                 Registrant     Registrar    Date\n\nDashed domains:\n\naccounts-cooperative[.]com Ozil Verfig       NiceNIC  Nov.\n2021\n\nacounts-service[.]com Ozil Verfig       NiceNIC  Nov.\n2021\n\ncdn-googlestatic[.]com  Ozil Verfig       NiceNIC  Feb.\n2022\n\ndocs-file[.]com  Ozil Verfig       NiceNIC  Mar.\n2022\n\ndownloads-drive[.]com Ozil Verfig       NiceNIC  Mar.\n2022\n\ndownloads-safe[.]com Ozil Verfig       NiceNIC  Mar.\n2022\n\ndrive-file[.]com Ozil Verfig       Cloudflare Mar.\n2022\n\nfile-office[.]com Ozil Verfig       NiceNIC  Mar.\n2022\n\nredhat-dev[.]com Ozil Verfig       NiceNIC  June\n2022\n\nspotify-account[.]xyz Ozil Verfig       DNSPod  April\n2022\n\nstatic-microsoft[.]com  Ozil Verfig       NiceNIC  June\n2022\n\nstorage-drive[.]com Ozil Verfig       NiceNIC  Mar.\n2022\n\nGaming “hacks” and scams:\n\nfortnightcheat[.]com Ozil Verfig       NiceNIC     Mar.\n2022\n\nrobloxforu[.]com Ozil Verfig       NiceNIC     Mar.\n2022\n\nskinchangenow[.]com Ozil Verfig       NiceNIC     Mar.\n2022\n\nvalorannow[.]com Ozil Verfig       NiceNIC     Mar.\n2022\n\nTyposquatting and lookalike domains:\n\nbllockchaln[.]online Ozil Verfig       DNSPod  May\n2020\n\ncertcodeplus[.]top Ozil Verfig       NiceNIC  Nov.\n2020\n\ncerticode[.]xyz  Ozil Verfig       NiceNIC  Oct.\n2020\n\ncerticodeplus[.]club Ozil Verfig       DNSPod  Oct.\n2020\n\ncerticodeplus[.]group Ozil Verfig       139.com  Oct.\n2020\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\ncerticodeplus[.]online  Ozil Verfig       DNSPod  Oct.\n2020\n\ncerticodeplus[.]top Ozil Verfig       NiceNIC  Sept.\n2020\n\ncerticodplus[.]site Ozil Verfig       NiceNIC  Oct.\n2020\n\ncertlcodeplus[.]top Ozil Verfig       NiceNIC  Oct.\n2020\n\nfirstechfed[.]site Ozil Verfig       NiceNIC  Oct.\n2020\n\nflrstechfed[.]com Ozil Verfig       NiceNIC  Oct.\n2020\n\nflrstechfed[.]group Ozil Verfig       139.com  Oct.\n2020\n\nflrsttechfed[.]group Ozil Verfig       139.com  Oct.\n2020\n\nlloyids[.]com              Ozil Verfig       NiceNIC  Oct.\n2020\n\nPanels:\n\ncaramelcorp[.]cc Ozil Verfig       NiceNIC  Dec.\n2020\n\ncaramelcorp[.]xyz Ozil Verfig       NiceNIC  Dec.\n2020\n\nbezpecnost[.]tech Ozil Verfig       NiceNIC  April\n2022\n\nbezpieczenstwo[.]app Ozil Verfig       NiceNIC  Dec.\n2021\n\nbezpieczenstwo[.]tech Ozil Verfig       DNSPod  April\n2022\n\ngotxest[.]top Ozil Verfig       NiceNIC  Oct.\n2020\n\npanel-smm[.]top  Ozil Verfig       NiceNIC  Jan.\n2022\n\nLikely malware:\n\nahf4ycvea439tt9rq[.]site Ozil Verfig       NiceNIC     March\n2022\n\nawqwywewfs56843[.]top     Ozil Verfig       DNSPod     Jan.\n2021\n\nbatroslunk[.]top Ozil Verfig       DNSPod     Dec.\n2020\n\nblctrsb[.]site  Ozil Verfig       NiceNIC     July\n2020\n\nfitollday[.]site Ozil Verfig       NiceNIC     April\n2020\n\ngaweawgeaweg232[.]top     Ozil Verfig       NiceNIC     Jan.\n2021\n\nghslitvompj[.]top     Ozil Verfig       NiceNIC     Nov.\n2020\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\nregisbrow[.]site Ozil Verfig       NiceNIC     July\n2020\n\nwindows-upgraded[.]com      Ozil Verfig       NiceNIC     Jan.\n2022\n\nwornegmot[.]top  Ozil Verfig       NiceNIC     Oct.\n2020\n\n```\n- For purposes of this table, domain registrant and domain registrant organization are\ncombined.\n\nConsistent domain naming conventions across several domain registrations and clustered\nduring specific time periods help define a nexus between CaramelCorp and whois records\nthat include “Ozil Verfig.” But how many of these domains are a signal instead of noise, and\ndoes that signal relate to CaramelCorp? The answer is simple. One can begin to identify a\nperson in a crowd – even when everyone looks the same – based on their activities outside\nof that crowd.\n\n## Forum presence of CaramelCorp promoter “letsz0ck3r”\n\nFigure 1:\n\nUfoLabs Russian-language hacking forum profile card for user “letsz0ck3r.”\n\nFirst mentioned in our earlier report, the actor “letsz0ck3r” (also known as “Zocker” and likely\n“or1kstar”) has a history of offering and promoting services on Russian-language cybercrime\nforums (Figures 1-2). Some of these may include:\n\n-   Selling “Star Stealer” malware that sends stolen data via Telegram (Figures 3-4)\n\n-   Likely use of popular off-the-shelf malware (Anubis, Redline, Arkei)\n\n-   Offering cash-out and laundering services using US-based financial institutions (Figure\n5)\n\n-   Selling malware encryption and digital signature services\n\n-   Promoting a hidden virtual network computing (hVNC) module for sale\n\n\n-----\n\n-   Video game mods and cheat systems (Figure 6)\n\nGiven the background of the Caramel skimmer, such products and services make sense\ncontextually. Of this list, most services are no longer offered. This could be in response to\nmarket forces, improved technical abilities, and/or more profitable cybercrime niches.\n\nFigure 2: A SkyNetZone post\n\nwhere actor “Zocker” shares the Telegram handle @letsz0ck3r as part of their contact\ninformation.\n\nFigure 3: A SkyNetZone hacking forum post summary promoting Star Stealer malware by\nuser “Zocker.”\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4:\n\nSkyNetZone hacking forum post promoting “Star Stealer,” which claims to steal a wide array\nof data and be largely undetectable by antivirus services.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5: Translation\n\nof actor “Zocker” promoting their cash-out services.\nAlong with a Russian-language hacking forum presence, “letsz0ck3r” appears interested in\nvideo game mods and cheat systems. Unsurprisingly, this actor maintains a presence on the\nPhoenix video game hacking forum (Figure 6). They also appear to be a customer, which\ncould suggest an interest in gaming beyond exploitation. This activity proved to be especially\nhelpful in this investigation.\n\nFigure 6: Examples of “letsz0ck3r” presence on the Phoenix video game hacking forum.\nNotably, their activity appears to center around aimbots–videogame cheats that vastly\nimprove a player’s reaction time and aim by modifying game configuration files via code\n\n\n-----\n\ninjection as well as using other methods. These modifications almost always violate\nmultiplayer game terms of service.\nVideo game mods and cheat systems represent a tiny fraction of the underground economy,\nbut their context deserves particular attention. Video game mods are frequent malware\npropagation vectors. Sometimes threat actors pair a game cheat system with malware;\nothers are rudimentary and simply install malware. The prospect of an unfair advantage in\nonline competitive games makes prospective targets much more likely to install them and\nignore antivirus alerts (see Figure 7 for an illustrative example). Because such cheat systems\noften use code injection to operate, requests to disable Windows Defender entirely and run\nthe program with administrator-level privileges seem credible to prospective targets.\nMalicious video game mods will often install stealer malware. Notably, DomainTools\nResearch monitors several Redline campaigns that use this precise propagation vector.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7: Description of an almost certainly malicious videogame cheat system from a\nrecently uploaded YouTube video. Used for illustrative purposes and without apparent ties to\nCaramelCorp. After claiming “files are completely clean,” the guide then requests potential\nvictims disable Windows Smart Screen and Defender.\nSeveral domains associated with CaramelCorp offer likely malicious video game mods and\ncheat systems. These domains use the domain registrant organization “Ozil Verfig.” Some\nexamples include the domains valorannow[.]com and fortnightcheat[.]com (Figures 8-9).\nBoth appear to be slightly modified clones of other very suspicious video game mod\nservices.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8: Screenshot of CaramelCorp-associated valorannow[.]com. Likely tied to malware\nactivity, this game cheat engine targets Valorant players.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 9: Screenshot of CaramelCorp-associated fortnightcheat[.]com. Likely tied to malware\nactivity, this game cheat engine targets Fortnite players.\nBut what more can one learn from domains and why would that matter? Sometimes threat\nactors inadvertently reveal additional cybercrime activity. Here, a minor OPSEC mistake\nsuggests “letsz0ck3r” also has a keen interest in cryptocurrency scams. Their mistake: using\none domain for two very different types of scam.\n\n## Cryptocurrency scams\n\nCryptocurrency scams are legion, and CaramelCorp’s adoption of them should surprise no\none. The purpose of a cryptocurrency scam is primarily cryptocurrency theft (or, in some\ncases, an attempt to install malware). More advanced cryptocurrency scams, referred to as\n“drainers,” not only steal credentials and wallet recovery phrases–they also empty\ncryptocurrency wallets and transfer the funds to an attacker-controlled wallet long before a\nvictim even realizes their mistake. These stolen funds are almost certainly unrecoverable\nwhen transferred and, especially when laundered using privacy-focused cryptocurrencies,\nexceedingly difficult to track by investigators.\n\nA simpler cryptocurrency scam uses “airdrops,” “money flips,” and “crypto giveaways” as\nlures to defraud victims. Each of these scams rely on the ruse that sending cryptocurrency\nsomewhere will result in a massive short-term return on investment. Victims lose all the\n\n\n-----\n\ncryptocurrency they send, which is then laundered by fraudsters. Like drainers, funds stolen\nusing this scam are almost certainly unrecoverable. As economists have long said, there is\nno free lunch.\n\nAnd why are these scams becoming so commonplace? The answer is painfully\nstraightforward: they succeed, with victim losses in the billions of dollars. Another key driver\nin the increasing popularity of cryptocurrency scams is decentralized finance (“DeFi”) paired\nwith the vast swath of cryptocurrency projects and services operating in the DeFi space.\nSeparating legitimate DeFi services from malicious ones can become difficult for even\nexperienced cryptocurrency traders.\n\n## A clearer picture of CaramelCorp with blurred lines\n\nImportantly, overlap in cybercrime activity can occur on the same domain and help further\ndefine a nexus of activity related to an actor group. Here, domains associated with\nCaramelCorp have historical screenshots of both likely malicious video game cheats and\ncryptocurrency scams within a relatively brief timeframe (Figures 10-11). The domain\nskinchangenow[.]com is by no means the exception.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 10: Likely malicious “Skinchanger” video game mod at skinchangenow[.]com.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 11: Cryptocurrency giveaway scam targeting Cardano holders at\nskinchangenow[.]com.\n\nThe CaramelCorp-associated domain valorannow[.]com featured a cryptocurrency scam that\nwas replaced weeks later with a landing page for the very suspicious “ValorantCheats”\nwebsite (Figure 12).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 12: DomainTools Iris Investigate screenshot history feature reveals how the domain\nvalorannow[.]com first began as a cryptocurrency giveaway scam.\nInterestingly, a historical screenshot of another CaramelCorp-associated domain appears to\nshow a data table viewable by an unauthenticated user. The domain in question is\ngotxest[.]top. This data table’s columns suggests its purpose was to collect skimmed\npayment data (Figure 13):\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nID\nURI\n\nBIN\n\nNumber\n\nExpired\n\nCVV\n\nBilling\n\nZIP\n\nCardholder\n\nPhone\n\nUAgent\n\n```\nFigure 13: What appears\n\nto be a table for skimmed card data exposed to the public web at gotxest[.]top, another\ndomain associated with CaramelCorp.\nGiven CaramelCorp’s interest in online credit card skimming, this historical screenshot of\ngotxest[.]top’ helps solidify further the nexus between “Ozil Verfig” domains and\nCaramelCorp’s activities as a whole.\n\nTaken together, a detailed portrait of CaramelCorp comes into focus. Instead of a skimmeras-a-service vendor, CaramelCorp represents a group focused on profit maximization that\npivots based on market signals, and–more importantly–one willing to learn from years of\nexperience. CaramelCorp’s behavior in this regard appears to be part of a trend, but not all is\nlost for defenders. An analyst mindset combined with quality data sets allow defenders to\ndefine, detect, and defend against threats promptly when threat actors pivot (or expand)\nactivities based on market shifts in the underground economy.
