This attack was e�ectively Dragon�y 2.0, an update to a campaign that began in 2014.\n\nMoving beyond our 2014 analysis of Dragon�y, (https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/mcafee-labs/operation-dragon�y\nimperils-industrial-protocol/) our current focus looks at the attack’s indicators to determine whether we can glean any\nfurther information regarding the source and possible motivations of those behind the campaign. The campaign targets\nenergy companies around the world by leveraging spear-phishing emails that, once successful, allow the attackers to\n\ndownload Trojan software. The Trojans provide access to the victims’ systems and networks.\n\n### Going Beyond Energy\n\nAlthough initial reports showed Dragon�y attacks targeting the energy sector, investigations by McAfee Labs and the\nAdvanced Threat Research team uncovered related attacks targeting the pharmaceutical, �nancial, and accounting\nindustries. Everything about this campaign points to a well-prepared assault that carefully considers each target, and\n\nconducts reconnaissance before taking any measures to exploit compromised targets.\n\nWe saw the group use several techniques to get a foothold in victims’ networks, including spear phishing, watering holes,\nand exploits of supply-chain technologies via previous campaigns. By compromising well-established software\n\nvulnerabilities and embedding within them “backdoor” malware, the victims think they are installing software from a\ntrusted vendor, while unaware of the supply-side compromise.\n\nOnce the attackers have a foothold, they create or gain user accounts to operate stealthily. Using the remote-desktop\nprotocol to hop among internal or external systems, they connect either to a control server if the risk is minimal or use an\n\ninternal compromised server to conduct operations\n\n\n-----\n\nthreat intelligence knowledge base of attack artifacts.\n\nOne of the starting points was a Trojan in the 2017 campaign with the following hashes:\n\nMD5: da9d8c78efe0c6c8be70e6b857400fb1\n\nSHA-256: fc54d8afd2ce5cb6cc53c46783bf91d0dd19de604308d536827320826bc36ed9\n\nComparing this code, we discovered another sample from the group that was used in a July 2013 attack\n(https://cdn.securelist.com/�les/2014/07/Kaspersky_Lab_crouching_yeti_appendixes_eng_�nal.pdf):\n\nMD5: 4bfdda1a5f21d56afdc2060b9ce5a170\nSHA-256: 07bd08b07de611b2940e886f453872aa8d9b01f9d3c61d872d6cfe8cde3b50d4\n\nFilename: �.exe\n\nThe �le was downloaded after a Java exploit executed on the victim’s machine, according to the 2013 attack report. After\nanalyzing the 2013 sample, we noticed that some of the executable’s resources were in Russian.\n\nComparing the code, we �nd the 2017 sample has a large percentage of the same code as the backdoor used in the 2013\n\nattacks. Further, some code in the 2017 backdoor is identical to code in the application TeamViewer, a legitimate remote\nadministration tool used by many around the world. By incorporating the code and in-memory execution, the attackers\n\navoid detection and leave no trace on disk.\n\nThe correlating hash we discovered that contained the same TeamViewer code was reported by Crysys, a Hungarian\n\n[security company. In their report on about ‘“TeamSpy,” (http://www.crysys.hu/teamspy/teamspy.pdf) they mentioned the](http://www.crysys.hu/teamspy/teamspy.pdf)\n\nhash we correlated as well: 708ceccae2c27e32637fd29451aef4a5. This particular sample had the following compile date\n\ndetails: 2011:09:07 – 09:27:58+01:00\n\nThe TeamSpy attacks were originally aimed at political and human right activists living in the Commonwealth of\n\nIndependent States (the former Soviet Union) and eastern European countries. Although the report attributes the attacks\nto a threat actor or actors and shared tactics and procedures, the motivations behind TeamSpy appear similar to those of\n\nthe Dragon�y group. With identical code reuse, could the TeamSpy campaign be the work of Dragon�y?\n\nBut that’s not all of interest. We also discovered that the 2017 sample contained code blocks associated with another\ninteresting malware family: BlackEnergy. Let’s look at an example of the code similarities we discovered:\n\n\n-----\n\nA BlackEnergy sample from 2016 (at left) alongside a Dragon�y sample from 2017.\n\nSelf-deleting code is very common in malware, but it is usually implemented by creating a batch �le and executing the\n\nbatch instead of directly calling the delete command, as we see in the preceding examples.\n\nThe BlackEnergy sample used in our comparison was captured in the Ukraine on October 31, 2015, and was mentioned in\n\nour post (https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/mcafee-labs/updated-blackenergy-trojan-grows-more-powerful/) on the\n\nevolution of the BlackEnergy Trojan. It is remarkable that this piece of code is almost identical in both samples, and\n\nsuggests a correlation between the BlackEnergy and Dragon�y campaigns.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Actor Sophistication\n\nOur analysis of this attack tells a story about the actors’ capability and skills. Their attack precision is very good; they know\n\nwhom and what to attack, using a variety of e�orts. Their focus is on Windows systems and they use well-known practices\n\nto gather information and credentials. From our research, we have seen the evolution of the code in their backdoors and\n\nthe reuse of code in their campaigns.\n\nHow well do the actors cover their tracks? We conclude they are fairly sophisticated in hiding details of their attacks, and in\n\nsome cases in leaving details behind to either mislead or make a statement. We rate threat actors by scoring them in\n\ndi�erent categories; we have mentioned a few. The Dragon�y group is in the top echelon of targeting attackers; it is\n\ncritical that those in the targeted sectors be aware of them.\n\nThe Dragon�y group is most likely after intellectual property or insights into the sector they target, with the ability to take\n\no�ensive disruptive and destructive action, as was reported (http://www.silicon.co.uk/security/blackenergy-trojan-ukrainepower-183050?inf_by=5a291109671db830108b4a17) in the 2015 attack on the Ukrainian power grid by a BlackEnergy\n\nmalware family.\n\nWe would like to thank the team at Intezer for their assistance and support during our research.\n\n Previous Article (https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/mcafee-labs/looking-into-the-world-of-ransomware-actorsreveals-some-surprises/)\n\n[Next Article  (https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/consumer/iot-supports-worlds-largest-industries/)](https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/consumer/iot-supports-worlds-largest-industries/)\n\n[ Categories: McAfee Labs (https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/category/mcafee-labs/)](https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/category/mcafee-labs/)\n\n[ Tags:  advanced persistent threats (https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/tag/advanced-persistent-threats/),](https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/tag/advanced-persistent-threats/)\n\n[cybercrime (https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/tag/cybercrime/), malware](https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/tag/cybercrime/)\n[(https://securingtomorrow mcafee com/tag/malware/) Phishing (https://securingtomorrow mcafee com/tag/phishing/)](https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/tag/phishing/)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Leave a reply\n\nFacebook Comments (0) Comments (0) G+ Comments\n\n**0 Comments** Sort by\n\nAdd a comment...\n\n[Facebook Comments Plugin](https://developers.facebook.com/products/social-plugins/comments/?utm_campaign=social_plugins&utm_medium=offsite_pages&utm_source=comments_plugin)\n\n## Newsletter Sign Up\n\nFirst Name\n\nLast name\n\nEmail\n\n\n**Oldest**\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n## McAfee on Twitter\n\n[ Follow us on Twitter (https://twitter.com/McAfee)](https://twitter.com/McAfee)\n\n[mcafee_labs (https://www.twitter.com/mcafee_labs)](https://www.twitter.com/mcafee_labs)\n\n[Prediction #2 (https://twitter.com/#search?q=2): Ransomware will continue to grow, but the motivations behind](https://twitter.com/#search?q=2)\n\n[these types of attacks will change.
