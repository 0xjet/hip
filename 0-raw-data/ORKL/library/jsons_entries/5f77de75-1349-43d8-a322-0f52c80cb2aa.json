While it may seem\ntrivial, things get complicated when you're tasked with managing 5000 GPOs created over\n[15 years by multiple teams without any best practices in mind. While working on GPOZaurr](https://github.com/EvotecIT/GPOZaurr)\n(my new PowerShell module), I've noticed that the more code I wrote to manage those\n**GPOs, the more I knew passing this knowledge to admins who will be executing this on a**\n**weekly/monthly basis is going to be a challenge. That's why I've decided to follow a similar**\n[approach as my other Active Directory testing module called Testimo. I've created a single](https://evotec.xyz/what-do-we-say-to-health-checking-active-directory/)\ncommand that analyses Group Policies using different methods and shows views from\ndifferent angles to deliver the full picture. On top of that, it provides a solution (or it tries to) so\nthat it's fairly easy to fix – as long as you agree with what it proposes.\n\nPlease be careful when using this on production\nI've done a lot of research and put a lot of effort into making sure this PowerShell module\nworks as expected. However, I do make mistakes. Contrary to my usual work, this module is\nnot read-only. To almost every read command, there is also a set or remove command. It can\nchange things, delete them, or modify them. If you don't understand what will happen, don't\ndo it. Review source code, run read commands first to understand the output, what it's\nshowing. If you have doubts – don't use it or create an issue on GitHub to clarify. All cmdlets\nthat have the ability to write/delete contain WhatIf/LimitProcessing count parameters. Use\nthem before implementing any changes!\n\n\n-----\n\n**Please keep in mind I ve tested GPOZaurr only on English based Active Directory. I**\nhave no clue how it will behave on non-English systems. As I've not worked with other\nlanguages for a while, I don't remember if object types are still reported in English by\nPowerShell or reported in language equivalent. Be careful.\n\n_Useful Links_\nPlease make sure to visit GitHub to review sources or report issues. If you're going to use it,\nI recommend doing it via PowerShellGallery as that version is minimized and optimized.\nReviewing sources is easier on the GitHub version as it has more comments and is divided\ninto sections.\n\n[The code is published on GitHub](https://github.com/EvotecIT/GPOZaurr)\n\n[Issues should be reported on GitHub](https://github.com/EvotecIT/GPOZaurr/issues)\n\n[Code is published as a module on PowerShellGallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/GpoZaurr/)\n\nThe module is signed with a certificate, like any new modules that I create or update.\n```\nInstall-Module GPOZaurr -Force\n\n```\n_Invoke-GPOZaurr - One command that makes a difference_\nAs mentioned before, Invoke-GPOZaurr follows a similar pattern to what Invoke-Testimo\ndoes. When run without any parameters, it will go thru all available reports one by one to\ndeliver a full-scope scan. Keep in mind that running this cmdlet without any parameters is\nfine for small domains, but it will take hours to complete for larger domains. For the domain\nof 5000 GPOs, some reports can take even 2 hours to complete.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen run, it will display a short information about what it is currently doing and which report\nis being generated. If you have a large domain and things take time, you may want to use\n**Invoke-GPOZaurr with Verbose parameter to get additional information.**\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce the cmdlet is complete HTML report will open up automatically.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs you can see on the screenshot above, multiple reports were created, each on a different\ntab. The design of the report is mostly the same. There is information about what the report\ndetected and why it did so on the report's top left. It also gives you a summary of your whole\nforest and where the issues are found. In the top right corner, I've added a small chart that\nvisualizes the current status. Some charts will show only problems. Some will show multiple\nstatues – all depending on the type of report getting generated. There is usually one, but\nsometimes more tables with displayed information depending on the problem in the second\nsection. Tables are color-coded to visualize better what is bad or to distinguish multiple\nproblems within the same report. Tables also allow you to export data to Excel, CSV or PDF.\n\n\n-----\n\nFinally, the last section contains the solution to the problem described. It usually provides\nstep by step instructions on fixing the problem if you choose to fix it. Most of the time,\nsolutions are automated to the point where a single line of code can fix an issue. For\nexample, delete all empty GPOs, delete all unlinked GPOs, and so on. One command,\nzero effort.\n\n_Invoke-GPOZaurr - Available reports_\nCurrently, Invoke-GPOZaurr has few built-in reports. Some of them are more advanced,\nsome of them are for review only. Here's the full list for today. Not everything is 100%\nfinished. Some will require some updates soon as I get more time and feedback. Feel free to\nreport issues/improve those reports with more information.\n\n**GPOBroken – this report can detect GPOs that are broken. By broken GPOs, I mean**\nthose which exist in AD but have no SYSVOL content or vice versa – have SYSVOL\ncontent, but there's no AD metadata. Additionally, it's able to detect GPO objects that\nare no longer GroupPolicy object. – Then, it provides an easy way to fix it using given\nstep-by-step instructions.\n**GPOBrokenLink – this report can detect links that have no matching GPO. For**\nexample, if a GPO is deleted, sometimes links to that GPO are not properly removed.\nThis command can detect that and propose a solution\n\n\n-----\n\n**GPOOwners – this report focuses on GPO Owners. By design, if Domain Admin**\ncreates GPO, the owner of GPO is the domain admins group. This report detects\nGPOs that are not owned by Domain Admins (in both SYSVOL and AD) and provides a\nway to fix them.\n**GPOConsistency – this report detects inconsistent permissions between Active**\nDirectory and SYSVOL, verifying that files/folders inside each GPO match permissions\nas required. It then provides you an option to fix it.\n**GPODuplicates – this report detects GPOs that are CNF, otherwise known as**\nduplicate AD Objects, and provides a way to remove them.\n**GPOList – this report summarizes all group policies focusing on detecting Empty,**\nUnlinked, Disabled, No Apply Permissions GPOs. It also can detect GPOs that are not\noptimized or have potential problems (disabled section, but still settings in it)\n**GPOLinks – this report summarizes links showing where the GPO is linked, whether**\nit's linked to any site, cross-domain, or the status of links.\n**GPOPassword – this report should detect passwords stored in GPOs.**\n**GPOPermissions – this report provides full permissions overview for all GPOs. It**\ndetects GPOs missing read permissions for Authenticated Users, GPOs that miss\nDomain Admins, Enterprise Admins, or SYSTEM permissions. It also detects GPOs\nthat have Unknown permissions available. Finally, it allows you to fix permissions for all\nthose GPOs easily. It's basically a one-stop for all permission needs.\n**GPOPermissionsAdministrative – this report focuses only on detecting missing**\nDomain Admins, Enterprise Admins permissions and allows you to fix those in no time.\n**GPOPermissionsRead – similar to an administrative report, but this one focuses on**\nAuthenticated Users missing their permissions.\n**GPOPermissionsRoot – this report shows all permissions assigned to the root of the**\ngroup policy container. It allows you to verify who can manage all GPOs quickly.\n**GPOPermissionsUnknown – this report focuses on detecting unknown permissions**\n(deleted users) and allows you to remove them painlessly.\n**GPOFiles – this report lists all files in the SYSVOL folder (including hidden ones) and**\ntries to make a decent guess whether the file placement based on extension/type\nmakes sense or requires additional verification. This was written to find potential\nmalware or legacy files that can be safely deleted.\n**GPOBlockedInheritance – this report checks for all Organizational Units with blocked**\ninheritance and verifies the number of users or computers affected.\n**GPOAnalysis – this report reads all content of group policies and puts them into 70+**\ncategories. It can show things like GPOs that do Drive Mapping, Bitlocker, Laps,\nPrinters, etc. It's handy to find dead settings, dead hosts, or settings that no longer\nmake sense.\n**NetLogonOwners – this report focuses on detecting NetLogon Owners and a way to**\nfix it to default, secure values.\n**NetLogonPermissions – this report provides an overview and assessment of all**\npermissions on the NetLogon share.\n\n\n-----\n\n**SysVolLegacyFiles – this report detects SYSVOL Legacy Files (.adm) files**\n\n_Invoke-GPOZaurr - Report GPOBroken_\nGroup Policies are stored in two places – Active Directory (metadata) and SYSVOL\n(content). Since those are managed in different ways, replicated in different ways, it's\npossible because of different issues, and they get out of sync.\n```\nInvoke-GPOZaurr -Type GPOBroken\n\n```\nWith just a few simple steps, you can have that fixed in a couple of minutes. Keep in mind\nthat you need to have healthy replication of group policies for this to work and not report\nfalse positives. If you have unhealthy replication and wrong, DC will get asked about those\nissues you could potentially remove legitimate content.\n\n_Invoke-GPOZaurr - Report GPOBrokenLink_\nWhen GPO is deleted correctly, it usually is removed from AD, SYSVOL, and any link to it is\nalso discarded. Unfortunately, this is true only if the GPO is created and linked within the\nsame domain. If GPO is linked in another domain, this leaves a broken link hanging on\nbefore it was linked. Additionally, the Remove-GPO cmdlet doesn't handle site link deletions,\nwhich causes dead links to be stuck on sites until those are manually deleted. This means\nthat any GPOs deleted using PowerShell may leave a trail.\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nInvoke GPOZaurr Type GPOBrokenLink\n\n```\n_Invoke-GPOZaurr - Report GPOOwners_\nBy default, GPO creation is usually maintained by Domain Admins or Enterprise Admins.\nWhen GPO is created by Domain Admins or Enterprise Admins group members, the GPO\nOwner is set to Domain Admins. When GPO is created by a member of Group Policy Creator\nOwners or other group has delegated rights to create a GPO, the owner of said GPO is not\nDomain Admins group but is assigned to the relevant user. GPO Owners should be Domain\nAdmins or Enterprise Admins to prevent abuse. If that isn't so, it means the owner can fully\ncontrol GPO and potentially change its settings in an uncontrolled way. While at the moment\nof creation of new GPO, it's not a problem, in the long term, it's possible such a person may\nno longer be admin, yet keep their rights over GPO. As your aware, Group Policies are\nstored in 2 places. In Active Directory (metadata) and SYSVOL (settings). This means that\nthere are 2 places where GPO Owners exists. This also means that for multiple reasons, AD\nand SYSVOL can be out of sync when it comes to their permissions, which can lead to\nuncontrolled ability to modify them. Ownership in Active Directory and Ownership of\nSYSVOL for said GPO is required to be the same.\n```\nInvoke-GPOZaurr -Type GPOOwners\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nThis report is fairly complete with detection and automated fix.\n\n_Invoke-GPOZaurr - Report GPOConsistency_\nWhen GPO is created, it creates an entry in Active Directory (metadata) and SYSVOL\n(content). Two different places mean two different sets of permissions. The group Policy\nmodule is making sure the data in both places is correct. However, it's not necessarily the\ncase for different reasons, and often permissions go out of sync between AD and SYSVOL.\nThis test verifies the consistency of policies between AD and SYSVOL in two ways. It checks\ntop-level permissions for a GPO and then checks if all files within said GPO is inheriting\npermissions or have different permissions in place.\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nInvoke GPOZaurr Type GPOConsistency\n\n```\nThis report is fairly complete and with an automated fix.\n\n_Invoke-GPOZaurr - Report GPODuplicates_\nCNF objects, Conflict objects, or Duplicate Objects are created in Active Directory when\nthere is simultaneous creation of an AD object under the same container on two separate\nDomain Controllers near about the same time or before the replication occurs. This results in\na conflict and a CNF (Duplicate) object exhibits the same. While it doesn't necessarily have a\nhuge impact on Active Directory, it's important to keep Active Directory in a proper, healthy\nstate.\n```\nInvoke-GPOZaurr -Type GPODuplicates\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nThis report is fairly complete and with an automated fix. Be advised above screenshot\ndoesn't show any detected problems because it's pretty hard to generate duplicated objects\non-demand, so my test environment doesn't have any. But it does detect those.\n\n_Invoke-GPOZaurr - Report GPOList_\nOver time Administrators add more and more group policies as business requirements\nchange. Due to neglect or thinking it may serve its purpose, later on, many Group Policies\noften have no value at all. Either the Group Policy is not linked to anything and stays\nunlinked forever, or GPO is linked, but the link (links) are disabled, or GPO is totally disabled.\nThen there are Group Policies that are targetting certain groups or persons, and that group is\nremoved, leaving Group Policy doing nothing. Additionally, sometimes new GPO is created\nwithout any settings, or the settings are removed over time, but GPO stays in place.\n```\nInvoke-GPOZaurr -Type GPOList\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nThis report is fairly complete and provides automated fixes for most issues detected.\n\n_Invoke-GPOZaurr - Report GPOPermissions_\nThe following report contains a full overview of all permissions around Group Policies. It\ndetects 4 different problems (lack of authenticated users, wrong permissions for Domain\nAdmins and Enterprise Admins, Unknown permissions, and lack of proper permission for\nSYSTEM account). It also contains all permissions, so it's easy to review all permissions\nfrom a single place. For each problem, automation is developed, so it's fairly easy to fix any\nissues as long as you agree with what's proposed.\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nInvoke GPOZaurr Type GPOPermissions\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nThis report is interactive, meaning clicking on a GPO in one table limits permissions shown in\nanother table. GPOPermissions type is kind of ultimate way for you to deal with\npermissions. I've made one report that covers what 3 different reports were covering before.\n```\nInvoke-GPOZaurr -Type\nGPOPermissionsRead,GPOPermissionsAdministrative,GPOPermissionsUnknown\n\n```\nSo while you can use the cmdlet above with each type separately – it's easier to use one.\n\n_Invoke-GPOZaurr - advanced usage_\n**Invoke-GPOZaurr is basically a wrapper of around 20 or so different GPO cmdlets that I**\nhave developed over a period of six months. I was worried that with so many cmdlets being\navailable in my module and my laziness in the documentation, I thought Invoke-GPOZaurr's\nthree-step approach (Describe Problem, Provide Data, Offer Solution) was an experiment\nthat I believe will help me manage my GPOs efficiently for years to come. Not everything is\ncompleted, but at the current state, it's good enough for release. It allows you to understand\nwhere you stand without spending days, weeks, or months of analysis depending on how big\nyour Active Directory is. Of course, this one little command has few more options that allow\nfor different customization options.\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nInvoke GPOZaurr [[ Type] <string[]>] [[ ExcludeGroupPolicies] <scriptblock>] [\nFilePath <string>] [-PassThru] [-HideHTML] [-HideSteps] [-ShowError] [-ShowWarning]\n[-Forest <string>] [-ExcludeDomains <string[]>] [-IncludeDomains <string[]>] \n[<CommonParameters>]\n\n```\nUsing a Type parameter, you can ask for one or multiple types. Providing FilePath\nparameter, you can tell GPOZaurr where to save created HTML file. PassThru, on the other\nhand, is useful to have HTML generated and get the output of the reports back to you for\nfuture analysis.\n\nIt's also possible to hide steps to fix a given problem. This can be useful if you're doing an\noverview for your Client/Management and don't want to show how to fix it.\n```\nInvoke-GPOZaurr -FilePath $Env:UserProfile\\Desktop\\Test.html -Type GPOBroken HideSteps\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nUsing HideHTML parameter prevents auto-opening of HTML. It's useful for automation\npurposes.\n```\n Invoke-GPOZaurr -FilePath $Env:UserProfile\\Desktop\\Test.html -Type GPOBroken HideSteps -HideHTML\n\n```\n_Invoke-GPOZaurr - Type GPOAnalysis_\n**GPO Analysis report is one of the coolest ones I've made. It's able to provide a lot of smaller**\nreports that show the content of group policies. Each report is a separate tab. Using GPO\n**GUI, you would normally show you similar output, but this one does it globally. If you've ever**\ntried to find all GPOs that map drives, find ones that have script execution – it's the way to\ngo.\n```\nInvoke-GPOZaurr -Type GPOAnalysis\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nThe idea for every report is that each setting is stored per each line. This sometimes means\nthat if the setting has a potential of 50 options, the report will generate 50 columns. I've not\nfound an easy way to make it readable without custom creating and every report. While I do\nthat for some of the reports, some are totally autogenerated. If you feel something is not\ncovered or require a better report, open up an issue, and we can see what can be done.\n\n_Invoke-GPOZaurr - Automating GPOZaurr to Email_\nSince I want to keep my group policies healthy at all times, I've developed small automation.\nThis automation deals with one report and sends an email to a ticketing system if there is a\nproblem or sends an update to the AD team that everything is great. This automation uses\n[PSWriteHTML (which is also used to generate HTML anyway). I've developed the module](https://github.com/EvotecIT/PSWriteHTML)\nwhere the description on each report is available to use outside of GPOZaurr (that's where\nthe PassThru parameter is useful).\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nImport Module GPOZaurr Force\n$PasswordSecureString = 'passwordSecureString'\n$Types = @(\n  @{\n    Name  = 'GPOOwners'\n    Path  = \"$PSScriptRoot\\Reports\\GPOOwners_$(Get-Date -f yyyy-MMdd_HHmmss).html\"\n    Subject = '[AD Compliance] Group Policy Owners Issue'\n    Ticket = '[Ticket#2001000](https://linkToChangeRequest)'\n    Attach = $true\n  }\n  @{\n    Name  = 'GPODuplicates'\n    Path  = \"$PSScriptRoot\\Reports\\GPODuplicates_$(Get-Date -f yyyy-MMdd_HHmmss).html\"\n    Subject = '[AD Compliance] Group Policy Duplicate (Conflicting) Objects\nDetected'\n    Ticket = '[Ticket#2001000](https://linkToChangeRequest)'\n    Attach = $true\n  }\n  @{\n    Name  = 'NetLogonOwners'\n    Path  = \"$PSScriptRoot\\Reports\\NetLogonPermissions_$(Get-Date -f yyyy-MMdd_HHmmss).html\"\n    Subject = '[AD Compliance] NetLogon Owners Issue'\n    Ticket = '[Ticket#2001000](https://linkToChangeRequest)'\n    Attach = $true\n  }\n  @{\n    Name  = 'GPOConsistency'\n    Path  = \"$PSScriptRoot\\Reports\\GPOConsistency_$(Get-Date -f yyyy-MMdd_HHmmss).html\"\n    Subject = '[AD Compliance] Group Policy Consistency'\n    Ticket = '[Ticket#2001000](https://linkToChangeRequest)'\n    Attach = $true\n  }\n  # Too big\n  @{\n    Name  = 'GPOPermissions'\n    Path  = \"$PSScriptRoot\\Reports\\GPOPermissions_$(Get-Date -f yyyy-MMdd_HHmmss).html\"\n    Subject = '[AD Compliance] Group Policy Permissions Analysis'\n    Ticket = '[Ticket#2001000](https://linkToChangeRequest)'\n    Attach = $false\n  }\n  @{\n    Name  = 'GPOList'\n    Path  = \"$PSScriptRoot\\Reports\\GPOList_$(Get-Date -f yyyy-MMdd_HHmmss).html\"\n    Subject = '[AD Compliance] Group Policy Empty & Unlinked & Disabled Cleanup'\n    Ticket = '[Ticket#2001000](https://linkToChangeRequest)'\n    Attach = $false\n  }\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n  @{\n    Name  = 'GPOBroken';\n    Path  = \"$PSScriptRoot\\Reports\\GPOOrphans_$(Get-Date -f yyyy-MMdd_HHmmss).html\";\n    Subject = '[AD Compliance] Group Policy Orphaned/Broken Cleanup'\n    Ticket = '[Ticket#2001000](https://linkToChangeRequest)'\n    Attach = $true\n  }\n  @{\n    Name  = 'GPOBrokenLink'\n    Path  = \"$PSScriptRoot\\Reports\\GPOBrokenLink_$(Get-Date -f yyyy-MMdd_HHmmss).html\"\n    Subject = '[AD Compliance] Group Policy Broken Links'\n    Ticket = '[Ticket#2001000](https://linkToChangeRequest)'\n    Attach = $true\n  }\n)\nforeach ($Type in $Types) {\n  $EmailHeaderBadReport = EmailHeader {\n    EmailFrom -Address 'EmailFrom@evotec.pl'\n    EmailTo -Addresses \"przemyslawklys@evotec.pl\", 'otherguy@evotec.pl'\n    EmailServer -Server 'smtpServer' -SSL -Port 25 -UserName 'login' -Password\n$PasswordSecureString -PasswordAsSecure\n    EmailOptions -Priority High -DeliveryNotifications Never\n    EmailSubject -Subject $Type.Subject\n    if ($Type.Attach -eq $true) {\n      EmailAttachment -FilePath $Type.Path\n    }\n  }\n  $EmailHeaderGoodReport = EmailHeader {\n    EmailFrom -Address 'EmailFrom@evotec.pl'\n    EmailTo -Addresses \"przemyslawklys@test.pl\", 'otherguy@evotec.pl'\n    EmailServer -Server 'smtpServer' -SSL -Port 25 -UserName 'login' -Password\n$PasswordSecureString -PasswordAsSecure\n    EmailOptions -Priority Low -DeliveryNotifications Never\n    EmailSubject -Subject $Type.Subject\n    if ($Type.Attach -eq $true) {\n      EmailAttachment -FilePath $Type.Path\n    }\n  }\n  $ReportOutput = Invoke-GPOZaurr -FilePath $Type.Path -Type $Type.Name -PassThru HideHTML -Verbose\n  foreach ($Report in $ReportOutput.Keys | Where-Object { $_ -notin 'Version',\n'Settings' }) {\n    if ($ReportOutput[$Report]['ActionRequired'] -eq $true) {\n      Email {\n        $EmailHeaderBadReport\n        EmailBody {\n          EmailText -Text 'Hello Team,' -LineBreak\n          EmailText -Text \"I've found disprepency in our domain that needs\nto be fixed and I need your help. \" -LineBreak\n          $ReportOutput[$Report]['Summary']\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n          EmailText LineBreak\n          EmailText -TextBlock {\n            \"This automation was approved by CAB in $($Type.Ticket). \"\n            \"The goal is to keep Group Policies Healthy at all times! \"\n            \"In case of issues please contact Przemyslaw Klys \"\n          } -LineBreak\n          EmailText -Text 'With regards,'\n          EmailText -Text 'Automated Monitoring'\n        } -FontSize 10pt\n      }\n    } else {\n      Email {\n        $EmailHeaderGoodReport\n        EmailBody {\n          EmailText -Text 'Hello Team,' -LineBreak\n          EmailText -Text \"I've run the report and everything is looking\ngreat.

For example, the permissions\nreport for 4000 GPOs is about 30MB in size. On the other hand, some other reports are\nmuch smaller. This is why there's an option to choose whether to attach a report or not.\n\n_Summary_\n**GPOZaurr is a huge module. It contains a lot of reports, and just a handful of those are**\nshown here. It's almost 20000 lines of code. It can deal with all sorts of\n**GPO/SYSVOL/NETLOGON problems you may have. Feel free to explore. On GitHub, the**\nfull source code is available (and somewhat readable – one function per file) and about 40\ndifferent examples. Not everything may be easy to understand, but I plan to release more\nblog posts on different ways to deal with issues. What's important to know is that this module\nwill work just fine with just user credentials. Of course, if you've removed authenticated users\nfrom a GPO, some reports will skip it, others will mark it as unavailable, but it does work. Of\ncourse, fixing issues will require Domain Admin, but that you can do manually – not even\nrunning GPOZaurr as Domain Admin.\n\n\n-----\n\n[The code is published on GitHub](https://github.com/EvotecIT/GPOZaurr)\n\n[Issues should be reported on GitHub](https://github.com/EvotecIT/GPOZaurr/issues)\n\n[Code is published as a module on PowerShellGallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/GpoZaurr/)\n\nThe module is signed with a certificate, like any new modules that I create or update.\n```\nInstall-Module GPOZaurr -Force\n\n```\nGO Ahead! Have fun! Make sure to report any issues, or if you feel like something would\nrequire covering more ground, let me know. My goal is to have GPOZaurr as the only way to\ndeal with Group Policies.\n\n\n-----",
