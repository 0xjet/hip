We’ve commonly observed one method over the past few years:\nunsigned DLL loading.\n\nAssuming that this method might be used by advanced persistent threats (APTs), we hunted\nfor it. The hunt revealed sophisticated payloads and APT groups in the wild, including the\n[Chinese cyberespionage group Stately Taurus (formerly known as](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/atoms/statelytaurus/) [PKPLUG, aka Mustang](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/pkplug_chinese_cyber_espionage_group_attacking_asia/)\nPanda) and the North Korean Selective Pisces (aka Lazarus Group).\n\n\n-----\n\nBelow, we show how hunting for the loading of unsigned DLLs can help you identify attacks\nand threat actors in your environment.\n\nPalo Alto Networks customers receive protections and detections against malicious DLL\n[loading through the Cortex XDR agent.](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cortex/cortex-xdr)\n\n**Threat Actor Groups**\n**Discussed**\n\n\n**Unit 42 tracks group**\n**as…**\n\n\n**Group also known as…**\n\n\nStately Taurus Mustang Panda, PKPLUG, BRONZE PRESIDENT,\nHoneyMyte, Red Lich, Baijiu\n\nSelective Pisces Lazarus Group, ZINC, APT - C - 26\n\n## Table of Contents\n\nMalicious DLLs: A Common Method Attackers Use for Executing Malicious Payloads on\nInfected Systems\n\nAttack Trends in the Wild Related to Unsigned DLLs\n\nDiving Into Selected Payloads\n\nStately Taurus\n\nSelective Pisces\n\nRaspberry Robin\n\nUsing Unsigned DLLs to Hunt for Attacks in Your Environment\n\nHunting Queries\n\nConclusion\n\n## Malicious DLLs: A Common Method Attackers Use for Executing Malicious Payloads on Infected Systems\n\nBased on our observations over years of proactive threat-hunting experience, we\nhypothesize that one of the main methods for executing malicious payloads on infected\nsystems is loading a malicious DLL. As both individual hackers and APT groups use this\nmethod, we decided to conduct research based on this hypothesis.\n\nMost of the malicious DLLs we observe in the wild share three common characteristics:\n\nThe DLLs are mostly written to unprivileged paths.\nThe DLLs are unsigned.\nTo evade detection, the DLLs are loaded by a signed process, whether a utility\ndedicated to loading DLLs (such as rundll32.exe) or an executable that loads DLLs as\npart of its activity\n\n\n-----\n\nWith that in mind, we found that the most common techniques that are being used by threat\nactors in the wild are the following:\n\n[1. DLL loading by rundll32.exe/regsvr32.exe – While those processes are signed and](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1218/011/)\n\nknown binaries, threat actors abuse them to achieve code execution in an attempt to\nevade detection.\n2. [DLL order hijacking – This refers to loading a malicious DLL by abusing the search](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/001/)\n\norder of a legitimate process. This way, a benign application will load a malicious\npayload with the name of a known DLL.\n\nReviewing the results of the above techniques in the wild revealed that the most common\nunprivileged paths to load malicious unsigned DLLs are the folders and sub-folders of\nProgramData, AppData and the users’ home directories.\n\nThe next section will introduce several findings based on the above hypothesis.\n\n## Attack Trends in the Wild Related to Unsigned DLLs\n\nTo start hunting based on the hypothesis we described, we created two XQL queries. The\nfirst one looks for unsigned DLLs that were loaded by rundll32.exe/regsvr32.exe, while the\nother looks for signed software that loads an unsigned DLL.\n\nThe hunting activity revealed various malware families that used unsigned DLL loading.\nFigure 1 presents the malware we detected using these methods over the past six months\n(February-August 2022).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. Malware observed using DLL loading.\nAnalyzing the execution techniques used by the above threats showed that banking trojans\nand individual threat actors typically used rundll32.exe or regsvr32.exe to load a malicious\nDLL, while APT groups used the DLL side-loading technique most of the time.\n\n## Diving Into Selected Payloads\n\n### Stately Taurus\n\n[We decided to highlight an investigation around Stately Taurus activity that we detected in](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/pkplug_chinese_cyber_espionage_group_attacking_asia/)\nthe environment of one organization. Stately Taurus is a Chinese APT group that usually\ntargets non-governmental organizations and is known for abusing legitimate software to load\npayloads.\n\nIn this case, we observed the usage of the DLL search order hijacking technique that\nenabled the attacker’s malicious DLL to load into the memory space of a legitimate process.\nThe threat actor used multiple pieces of third party software for the DLL side-loading, such\nas antivirus software and a PDF reader.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2. AvastSvc.exe uses side-loading to load a malicious DLL.\nTo achieve DLL side-loading, the group dropped the payload into the ProgramData folder,\nwhich contained three files – a benign EXE file for DLL hijacking (AvastSvc.exe), a DLL file\n(wsc.dll) and an encrypted payload (AvastAuth.dat). The loaded DLL appeared to be the\n[PlugX RAT, which loads the encrypted payload from the .dat file.](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/thor-plugx-variant/)\n\nFigure 3. PlugX files: benign executable, DLL loader and encrypted .dat file.\n\n### Selective Pisces\n\nAmong the results of our hunting queries, we also identified several high-entropy malicious\nmodules within the ProgramData directories shown in Figure 4.\n\nFigure 4. DLL side-loading by Selective Pisces.\nInvestigating the execution chain of the unsigned modules shown in Figure 4 revealed that\nthey were dropped to the disk by the signed DreamSecurity MagicLine4NX process\n(MagicLine4NX.exe).\n\n\n-----\n\nMagicLine4NX.exe executed a second-stage payload that we observed utilizing DLL sideloading in order to evade detection. The second-stage payload wrote a new DLL named\nmi.dll, and copied wsmprovhost.exe (host process for WinRM) to a random directory in\nProgramData. Wsmprovhost.exe is a native Windows binary that attempts to load mi.dll from\nthe same directory. The attackers abused this mechanism in order to achieve DLL side[loading (T1574.002) with this process.](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/002/)\n\nThe mi.dll payload was observed dropping a new payload named ualapi.dll to the System32\ndirectory (C:\\Windows\\System32\\ualapi.dll). As ualapi.dll is in this case a missing DLL on the\nSystem32 directory, the attackers used this fact to achieve persistence by giving their\nmalicious payload the name ualapi.dll. That way, spoolsv.exe will load it upon startup.\n\nAfter analyzing the payloads above, we attributed them to the North Korean APT group that\nUnit 42 tracks as Selective Pisces. This group’s utilization of legitimate third party-software\n[such as MagicLine4NX was described earlier this year in a blog post by Symantec.](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/lazarus-dream-job-chemical)\n\n### Raspberry Robin\n\nThe last attack we would like to elaborate on is the most common one we observed in the\nwild.\n\nSome of the results that our query yields share several common characteristics:\n\nDLLs with scrambled names reside in random sub-folders of the ProgramData or\nAppData folders.\nThose DLLs have a similar range of entropy (~0.66).\nAll of them were loaded by rundll32.exe or regsvr32.exe\n\nFor example: RUNDLL32.EXE C:\\ProgramData\\\n<random_folder>\\fhcplow_Tudjdm.dll,iarws_sbv\n\nFigure 5. DLLs loaded by Raspberry Robin.\nThe DLL loading activities that take place in those attacks were attributed to a campaign\n[called Raspberry Robin which was recently described by Red Canary](https://redcanary.com/blog/raspberry-robin/)\n\n\n-----\n\nThose attacks begin from a shortcut file on an infected USB device. This spawns\nmsiexec.exe to retrieve the malicious DLL from a remote C2 server. Over installation, a\nscheduled task is created in order to achieve persistence, loading the DLL using\nrundll32.exe/regsvr32.exe on system start up.\n\n## Using Unsigned DLLs to Hunt for Attacks in Your Environment\n\nYou can hunt for the loading of unsigned DLLs using XQL Search in Cortex XDR.\n\nTo narrow down the results, we suggest focusing on the following:\n\nFor DLL side-loading, we recommend paying attention to known third-party software\nplaced in non-standard directories.\nFocus on the file’s entropy – binaries that have a high value of entropy may contain a\npacked section that will be extracted during execution.\nFocus on the frequency of execution – high-frequency results may indicate a legitimate\nactivity that occurs periodically, while low-frequency results may be a lead for an\ninvestigation.\nFocus on the file’s path – results that contain folders or files with scrambled names are\nmore suspicious than others.\n\nFigure 6. Query results sorted by the module’s entropy.\nFigure 6 contains partial results of the queries that are mentioned in the next section, sorted\nby the module’s entropy. While the first two rows are an example of Emotet execution, the\nothers are benign DLLs.\n\n### Hunting Queries\n\n\n-----\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n\n\n// Rundll32.exe / Regsvr32.exe loads an unsigned module from uncommon folders\nover the past 30 days.\n\nconfig case_sensitive = false timeframe = 30d\n| dataset = xdr_data\n| filter event_type = ENUM.LOAD_IMAGE and (action_module_path contains\n\"C:\\ProgramData\" or action_module_path contains \"\\public\" or action_module_path\ncontains \"\\documents\" or action_module_path contains \"\\pictures\" or\naction_module_path contains \"\\videos\" or action_module_path contains \"appdata\") and\naction_module_signature_status = 3 and (actor_process_image_name contains\n\"rundll32.exe\" or actor_process_image_name contains \"regsvr32.exe\") and\n(actor_process_command_line contains \"programdata\" or\nactor_process_command_line contains \"\\public\" or actor_process_command_line\ncontains \"\\documents\" or actor_process_command_line contains \"\\pictures\" or\nactor_process_command_line contains \"\\videos\" or actor_process_command_line\ncontains \"appdata\")\n| alter module_entropy = json_extract_scalar(action_module_file_info, \"$.entropy\")\n| fields agent_hostname, action_module_sha256, action_module_path,\nactor_process_image_name, actor_process_command_line, module_entropy\n| comp count (action_module_path) as counter by action_module_path,\naction_module_sha256, module_entropy\n\n// Possible DLL side-loading - a signed process loaded an unsigned DLL from\nAppData\\ProgramData\\Public folder over the past 30 days\n\nconfig case_sensitive = false timeframe = 30d\n| dataset = xdr_data\n| filter event_type = ENUM.LOAD_IMAGE and (action_module_path contains\n\"C:\\ProgramData\" or action_module_path contains \"\\public\" or action_module_path\ncontains \"appdata\") and action_module_signature_status = 3 and\n(actor_process_image_name not contains \"rundll32.exe\" or\nactor_process_image_name not contains \"regsvr32.exe\") and\nactor_process_signature_status = 1 and (actor_process_image_path contains\n\"appdata\" or actor_process_image_path contains \"programdata\" or\nactor_process_image_path contains \"public\" )\n| alter module_entropy = json_extract_scalar(action_module_file_info, \"$.entropy\")\n| fields agent_hostname, action_module_sha256, action_module_path,\nactor_process_image_name, actor_process_command_line, module_entropy,\nactor_process_image_path\n| comp count (action_module_path) as counter by action_module_path,\naction_module_sha256, module_entropy, actor_process_image_path\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nMost detection techniques for blocking malicious DLLs rely on the module's behavior after it\nhas been loaded into memory. This can limit the ability to block all malicious modules.\n\n\n-----\n\nThat said, you can proactively hunt for malicious unsigned DLLs using hunting approaches\nsuch as the ones presented in this blog.\n\nKnowing the baseline of your network in terms of legitimate software or behavior can reduce\nthe number of results generated by the above queries, allowing you to focus on results that\nmight be suspicious.\n\nCortex XDR alerts on and blocks malicious DLLs loaded by known hijacking techniques, and\ncan also prevent post-exploitation activities, through the Behavioral Threat Protection and\nAnalytics modules.\n\nIndicators of compromise and TTPs associated with Stately Taurus can be found in the\n[Stately Taurus ATOM.](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/atoms/statelytaurus/mware/)\n\nIf you think you may have been compromised or have an urgent matter, get in touch with the\n[Unit 42 Incident Response team or call North America Toll-Free: 866.486.4842](http://start.paloaltonetworks.com/contact-unit42.html)\n(866.4.UNIT42), EMEA: +31.20.299.3130, APAC: +65.6983.8730, or Japan:\n+81.50.1790.0200.\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n\n**Threat**\n**Actor**\n\nSelective\nPisces\n\nSelective\nPisces\n\nSelective\nPisces\n\nSelective\nPisces\n\nSelective\nPisces\n\nSelective\nPisces\n\nSelective\nPisces\n\nSelective\nPisces\n\n\n**SHA256**\n\n779a6772d4d35e1b0018a03b75cc6f992d79511321def35956f485debedf1493\n\nd9b1ad70c0a043d034f8eecd55a8290160227ea66780ccc65d0ffb2ebc2fb787\n\n3131985fa7394fa9dbd9c9b26e15ac478a438a57617f1567dc32c35b388c2f60\n\n5be717dc9eda4df099e090f2a59c25372d6775e7d6551b21f385cf372247c2fd\n\n18cc18d02742da3fa88fc8c45fe915d58abb52d3183b270c0f84ae5ff68cf8a2\n\n7aa62af5a55022fd89b3f0c025ea508128a03aab5bc7f92787b30a3e9bc5c6e4\n\n79b7964bde948b70a7c3869d34fe5d5205e6259d77d9ac7451727d68a751aa7d\n\ncf9ccba037f807c5be523528ed25cee7fbe4733ec19189e393d17f92e76ffccc\n\n\n-----\n\nSelective\nPisces\n\nSelective\nPisces\n\nSelective\nPisces\n\nStately\nTaurus\n\nStately\nTaurus\n\nStately\nTaurus\n\nRaspberry\nRobin\n\nRaspberry\nRobin\n\nRaspberry\nRobin\n\nRaspberry\nRobin\n\nRaspberry\nRobin\n\n\n32449fd81cc4f85213ed791478ec941075ff95bb544ba64fa08550dd8af77b69\n\n5a8b1f003ae566a8e443623a18c1f1027ec46463c5c5b413c48d91ca1181dbf7\n\n5bb4950a05a46f7d377a3a8483484222a8ff59eafdf34460c4b1186984354cf9\n\n352fb4985fdd150d251ff9e20ca14023eab4f2888e481cbd8370c4ed40cfbb9a\n\n6491c646397025bf02709f1bd3025f1622abdc89b550ac38ce6fac938353b954\n\ne8f55d0f327fd1d5f26428b890ef7fe878e135d494acda24ef01c695a2e9136d\n\n06f11ea2d7d566e33ed414993da00ac205793af6851a2d6f809ff845a2b39f57\n\n202dab603585f600dbd884cb5bd5bf010d66cab9133b323c50b050cc1d6a1795\n\nf9e4627733e034cfc1c589afd2f6558a158a349290c9ea772d338c38d5a02f0e\n\n9fad2f59737721c26fc2a125e18dd67b92493a1220a8bbda91e073c0441437a9\n\n9973045c0489a0382db84aef6356414ef29814334ecbf6639f55c3bec4f8738f\n\n\n_Table 1.
