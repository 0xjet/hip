Picture taken with a long exposure. REUTERS/Raphael Satter\n\nSomeone was stealing footage from their own security cameras.\n\n\n-----\n\nActing on a tip from Japanese cyber researchers, the African Union s (AU) technology\nstaffers discovered that a group of suspected Chinese hackers had rigged a cluster of\nservers in the basement of an administrative annex to quietly siphon surveillance videos from\nacross the AU’s sprawling campus in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia’s capital.\n\nThe security breach was carried out by a Chinese hacking group nicknamed “Bronze\nPresident,” according to a five-page internal memo reviewed by Reuters. It said the affected\ncameras covered “AU offices, parking areas, corridors, and meeting rooms.”\n\n“We cannot estimate the quantity and value of the data which have been stolen,” the memo\ncontinued, adding that while AU technicians had managed to interrupt the flow of data, the\nhackers could easily regain the upper hand.\n\n“We are still weak to prevent another attack,” the memo said.\n\nThe alert, drafted in late January and circulated to senior officials, provides a glimpse of how\nworld powers are jockeying for influence and visibility at the continent’s paramount panAfrican organization. Some American and European officials have voiced concern as Beijing\nhas stepped in to meet the AU’s needs - part of an Africa-wide shift that has seen China\nbecome the continent’s top creditor. Chinese workers built the AU’s showpiece new\nconference center in 2012 and Chinese technicians still help maintain the organization’s\ndigital infrastructure.\n\nThe Chinese mission to the AU said in an email that “the AU side has not mentioned being\nhacked on any occasion” and that Africa and China are “good friends, partners and\nbrothers.”\n\n“We never interfere in Africa’s internal affairs and wouldn’t do anything that harms the\ninterests of the African side,” the email said.\n\nSlideshow ( 3 images )\n\nRepeated messages sent to AU spokesperson Ebba Kalondo asking about the January\nbreach were marked as “read” but went unanswered.\n\nLongstanding doubts over Beijing's role at the AU spilled into the open in 2018, when French\n[newspaper Le Monde reported here that AU employees had found that the servers at the](https://www.lemonde.fr/afrique/article/2018/01/26/a-addis-abeba-le-siege-de-l-union-africaine-espionne-par-les-chinois_5247521_3212.html)\nnew conference center were sending copies of their contents to Shanghai every night and\nthat the building itself had been honeycombed with listening devices.\n\nBoth the AU and the Chinese government vehemently denied the report at the time, but a\nformer AU official told Reuters the article in Le Monde was accurate and had put officials\nthere on high alert over cyberespionage.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe former official said the latest breach was discovered following a tip from Japan s\nComputer Emergency Response Team (CERT), which in a Jan. 17 email alerted AU officials\nto unusual traffic between the international organization’s network and a domain associated\nwith Bronze President.\n\nKoichiro Komiyama, who directs the global coordination division of Japan’s CERT, confirmed\nto Reuters that he sent the warning after a fellow researcher discovered the malicious traffic\nwhile picking through the hacking group’s old infrastructure.\n\nThe AU memo said that, within days of Komiyama’s email, the AU’s information technology\nteam had traced the suspicious traffic to a set of servers in the basement of the\norganization’s Building C - part of an older complex across the road from the new conference\ncenter.\n\nThe memo said the hackers were able to siphon off “a huge volume of traffic” from the\nservers by hiding it in the regular flow of data leaving the AU’s network during business\nhours, even pausing their data theft during lunch.\n\nSecureworks, an arm of Dell Technologies Inc which has been tracking Bronze President\nsince 2018, confirmed that the malicious domain identified by Japan’s CERT was linked to\nthe hackers.\n\nSecureworks researcher Mark Osborn said his company had seen strong evidence that\nBronze President operated from China, adding that it had been detected in several\nespionage campaigns targeting China’s neighbors, including Mongolia and India.\n\nAny official protest over the spying is unlikely, according to the former AU official. He said\nChina plays a critical role in keeping the organization running, including during an incident in\nJune when part of the AU’s network was knocked out by a power failure and Chinese\ntechnicians swiftly repaired the damage.\n\nFor that reason, the former official expects that the surveillance camera incident - like the\nlistening devices reported in 2018 - would be swept under the rug.\n\n“Attacking the Chinese, for us, it’s a very bad idea,” he said.\n\nReporting by Raphael Satter; editing by Jonathan Weber and Edward Tobin\n\nOur Standards: [The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.](http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html)\n\nfor-phone-onlyfor-tablet-portrait-upfor-tablet-landscape-upfor-desktop-upfor-wide-desktop-up\n\n\n-----",
