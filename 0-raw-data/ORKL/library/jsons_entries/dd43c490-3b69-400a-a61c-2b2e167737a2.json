We assess with\nhigh confidence that this activity is carried out on behalf of the North Korean government given malware\ndevelopment artifacts and targeting that aligns with North Korean state interests. FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence\n[believes that APT37 is aligned with the activity publicly reported as Scarcruft and Group123.](https://cdn.securelist.com/files/2017/10/Guerrero-Saade-Raiu-VB2017.pdf)\n\n[Read our report, APT37 (Reaper): The Overlooked North Korean Actor, to learn more about our assessment that](https://www2.fireeye.com/rs/848-DID-242/images/rpt_APT37.pdf)\nthis threat actor is working on behalf of the North Korean government, as well as various other details about their\noperations:\n\n**Targeting: Primarily South Korea – though also Japan, Vietnam and the Middle East – in various industry**\nverticals, including chemicals, electronics, manufacturing, aerospace, automotive, and healthcare.\n\n**Initial Infection Tactics: Social engineering tactics tailored specifically to desired targets, strategic web**\ncompromises typical of targeted cyber espionage operations, and the use of torrent file­sharing sites to\ndistribute malware more indiscriminately.\n\n**Exploited Vulnerabilities: Frequent exploitation of vulnerabilities in Hangul Word Processor (HWP), as**\nwell as Adobe Flash. The group has demonstrated access to zero­day vulnerabilities (CVE­2018­0802), and\nthe ability to incorporate them into operations.\n\n**Command and Control Infrastructure: Compromised servers, messaging platforms, and cloud service**\nproviders to avoid detection. The group has shown increasing sophistication by improving their operational\nsecurity over time.\n\n**Malware: A diverse suite of malware for initial intrusion and exfiltration. Along with custom malware used**\nfor espionage purposes, APT37 also has access to destructive malware.\n\nMore information on this threat actor is found in our report, APT37 (Reaper): The Overlooked North Korean\n_[Actor. You can also register for our upcoming webinar for additional insights into this group.](https://www2.fireeye.com/WBNR-APT37-Overlooked-North-Korean-Threat.html)_\n\n[This entry was posted on Tue Feb 20 08:30 EST 2018 and filed under FireEye, North Korea, and APT.](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research.html/category/etc/tags/fireeye-blog-authors/cap-fireeye)\n\n\n##### Sign up for email updates\nGet information and insight on today's advanced threats from the leader in advanced threat\n\nti\n\n\n-----\n\nEmail Address\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n**Company**\n\n[About FireEye](https://www.fireeye.com/company/why-fireeye.html)\n\n[Customer Stories](https://www.fireeye.com/customers.html)\n\n[Careers](https://www.fireeye.com/company/jobs.html)\n\n[Partners](https://www.fireeye.com/partners.html)\n\n[Investor Relations](http://investors.fireeye.com/)\n\n[Supplier Documents](https://www.fireeye.com/company/supplier.html)\n\n**News & Events**\n\n[Newsroom](https://www.fireeye.com/company/newsroom.html)\n\n[Press Releases](https://www.fireeye.com/company/press-releases.html)\n\n[Webinars](https://www.fireeye.com/company/webinars.html)\n\n[Events](https://www.fireeye.com/company/events.html)\n\n[Blogs](https://www.fireeye.com/blog.html)\n\n[Communication Preferences](https://www2.fireeye.com/manage-your-preferences.html)\n\n**Technical Support**\n\n[Incident?](https://www.fireeye.com/company/incident-response.html)\n\n[Report Security Issue](https://www.fireeye.com/company/security.html)\n\n[Contact Support](https://www.fireeye.com/support/contacts.html)\n\n[Customer Portal](https://csportal.fireeye.com/secur/login_portal.jsp?orgId=00D3000000063LS&portalId=06030000000pSNE)\n\n[Communities](https://community.fireeye.com/welcome)\n\n[Documentation Portal](https://docs.fireeye.com/)\n\n\nCompany Name\n\n\n**Stay Connected**\n\n#      \n\n**Contact Us**\n+1 888­227­2721\n\n**Cyber Threat Map**\n\nCopyright © 2018 FireEye Inc All rights reserved\n\n\n-----\n\n-----",
