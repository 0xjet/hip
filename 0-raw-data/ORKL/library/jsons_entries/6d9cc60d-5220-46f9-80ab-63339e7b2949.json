    "plain_text": "# New htpRAT Gives Complete Remote Control Capabilities to Chinese Cyber Threat Actors\n\n**riskiq.com/blog/labs/htprat/**\n\nOctober 26, 2017\n\nExternal Threat Management Labs\n\nOctober 26, 2017\n\nBy Yonathan Klijnsma\n\n[HtpRAT, a newly discovered Remote Access Trojan (RAT) extends the capabilities of](https://www.riskiq.com/research/htprat/)\ntraditional RATs by providing complete remote execution of custom commands and\nprogramming. htpRAT, uncovered by RiskIQ cyber investigators, is the newest weapon in\nChinese cyberattackers' campaign against Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).\n\nMost RATs can log keystrokes, take screenshots, record audio and video from a webcam or\ncomputer microphone, install and uninstall programs and manage files. They support a fixed\nset of commands operators can execute with different command IDs —’file download' or ‘file\nupload,' for example—and must be completely rebuilt to have different functionality.\n\nhtpRAT, on the other hand, serves as a conduit for operators to do their job with greater\nprecision and effect. On the Command and Control (C2) server side, cyber threat actors can\nbuild new functionality in commands, which can be sent to the malware to execute. This\n\n\n-----\n\ncapability makes htpRAT a small, agile and incredibly dynamic piece of malware. Operators\ncan change functionality, such as searching for a different file on the victim network, simply\nby wrapping commands.\n\nASEAN countries endure complicated and often contentious relations with one another,\nespecially over China's economic influence and its claim over disputed territory in the South\nChina Sea. As a way to spy on and disrupt rivals, China has sponsored several documented\ncyberattacks against its neighbors. Use of htpRAT elevates an attacker’s capabilities to a\nnew level.\n\nUnfortunately, most ASEAN countries have notoriously underdeveloped cybersecurity\npractices and levels of awareness, both in the public and private sectors, making\ngovernment and business organizations easy pickings for hackers—especially those from\nhighly skilled and experienced attackers commissioned by the Chinese government. A 2015\nsurvey by ESET Asia found that 78% of internet users in Southeast Asia had not received\nany formal education on cybersecurity. [Another study revealed that Asia-Pacific companies](https://www.beazley.com/news/2016/cyber_security_a_growing_concern_for_singapore_smes.html)\nspent 47% less on information security than North American firms in 2015.\n\n[As a result, many of these countries are already under siege. In a cybercrime operation led](http://www.computerweekly.com/news/450417440/Interpol-uncovers-nearly-9000-C2-servers-in-ASEAN)\nby Interpol, nearly 9,000 C2 servers and hundreds of compromised websites were identified\nacross the ASEAN region for carrying out cyber attacks on local organizations. Another\nstudy, revealed that in Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam, more than 20% of computers\nrunning Windows were targeted by cyber attacks, compared with the global average of 9%.\n\nLaos, which is ranked 77th in the world in its response to online threats in the International\nTelecommunication Union Cybersecurity Index, is also vulnerable. On November 8, 2016,\nRiskIQ discovered that a non-disclosed Laotian entity was spear-phished by what seems to\nbe--based on the tooling and its links to other attacks--a Chinese government threat group. A\nclever email attempted to get victims to download a nefarious RAT that includes a back door\nfor administrative control over the target computer via a link shown in the attached file below.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Spear phishing has, of course, become a favorite vector for cyber threat actors who try to](https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/criminals-atlantic-monthly/)\nfool people within specific organizations into giving up sensitive information by clicking on\nmalicious links or downloading malicious files with fake emails purporting to be from\nsomeone the victim may know. Typically, they do this by spoofing an email address and\nmimicking the language, behaviors, and processes used in the day-to-day operations of the\norganization.\n\nIn this case, the malicious file encourages the recipient, in both Lao and English, to click a\nlink to \"Enable Content,\" with an added image showing how to enable macros in the\ndocument. The top part containing Lao and English\n\"u0e97u0ec8u0eb2u0e99u0eaau0eb2u0ea1u0eb2u0e94u0e81u0ebbu0e94 Enable Content\nu0ec0u0e9au0eb4u0ec8u0e87 u0ec1u0ea5u0eb0\nu0e9bu0ebdu0e99u0e82u0ecdu0ec9u0ea1u0eb9u0e99u0e82u0eadu0e87u0e95u0ebbu0e99\"\nroughly translates to \"You can click 'Enable Content' to (see/change) the data.\"\n\nOnce the machine is infected, we noticed something remarkable. Chinese state-sponsored\nhackers are known for old, reliable tooling (PlugX malware is one example), but htpRAT\nenables cyber threat actors to create new commands from the C2 server side which can be\nsent to the malware on the infected host to execute.\n\n**Connections to Other Attacks**\n\nHackers associated with China like to employ the same malware over and over, which is part\nof what makes htpRAT so unique. Older samples connected to the C2 domain used in the\nhtpRAT campaign link to a variety of PlugX malware samples and Hacking Team exploit\nactivity. One especially interesting connection is a piece of malware called ‘MyHNServer,’\nwhich is a packaged PlugX payload linked to another piece of malware called ‘MyCL’ via its\n[C2 server, which has been widely used in other attacks in Vietnam.](http://security.bkav.com/home/-/blogs/malware-attacking-vietnam-airlines-appears-in-many-other-agenci-1/normal?p_p_auth=DHFn7deT)\n\nLooking at the registration information for the C2 domain, we found a link to a more recent\n[attack against the Vietnamese government. The domain is registered to a person with the](http://e.gov.vn/theo-doi-ngan-chan-ket-noi-va-xoa-cac-tap-tin-chua-ma-doc-a-NewsDetails-37486-14-186.html)\nsame email address that was also used to register a domain imitating an official military\ndomain in Vietnam.\n\nThese findings and others reveal a significant escalation in state-sponsored cyber warfare\nand could become standard fare for advanced cybercriminal attacks on businesses and\norganizations around the world. If effectively used, the new tools could make detection more\ndifficult and could help attackers move beyond the theft of data and secrets to more data or\nsystem manipulation or other kinds of sabotage.\n\n[Download the report for a full analysis of the malware, including details of the investigation,](https://www.riskiq.com/research/htprat/)\nIOCs, and infrastructure analysis.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Subscribe to Our Newsletter\n\nSubscribe to the RiskIQ newsletter to stay up-to-date on our latest content, headlines,\nresearch, events, and more.\n\nBase Editor\n\n\n-----",
