Intel purchased the company in December 2019 for\napproximately $2 billion.\n\nToday, the Pay2Key ransomware operation leaked data allegedly stolen from Habana Labs\nduring a cyberattack. This data includes Windows domain account information, DNS zone\ninformation for the domain, and a file listing from its Gerrit development code review\nsystem.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Pay2Key data leak page for Habana Labs**\nIn addition to the content posted on their data leak site, the Pay2Key operators have leaked\nbusiness documents and source code images.\n\n**Alleged source**\n\n**code stolen from Habana Labs**\nIn a threat posted to Pay2Key's data leak site, the threat actors have stated that Habana\nLabs has \"72hrs to stop leaking process...\" It is not known what ransom demands are being\nmade, if any, to stop the leaking of data.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt is believed that this attack is not meant to generate revenue for the threat actors but\nrather to cause havoc for Israeli interests.\n\nBleepingComputer has contacted Habana Labs with questions regarding the attack but has\nnot heard back.\n\n## Pay2Key responsible for recent Israeli cyberattacks\n\n[Pay2Key is a relatively new ransomware operation behind a series of attacks against Israeli](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-pay2key-ransomware-encrypts-networks-within-one-hour/)\n[businesses in November 2020, as reported by Israeli cybersecurity firms Check Point and](https://research.checkpoint.com/2020/ransomware-alert-pay2key/)\n[Profero.](https://profero.io/)\n\nProfero believes Iranian threat actors are behind the ransomware operation after tracking\nthe group's ransom payment wallets to Iranian bitcoin exchanges.\n\n[This week @_CPResearch_ released an analysis of ransomware targeting Israeli](https://twitter.com/_CPResearch_?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\nSME dubbed \"Pay2Key\".

This is another major escalation in the current cyber-conflict\n[between Israel and Iran. pic.twitter.com/idIWAm8JTb](https://t.co/idIWAm8JTb)\n\n— Profero (@ProferoSec) [December 13, 2020](https://twitter.com/ProferoSec/status/1338107198719856641?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nProfero CEO Omri Moyal is [warning Israeli companies to harden their network's defenses](https://twitter.com/GelosSnake/status/1338104607868907526?s=20)\nas further cyberattacks from Iran are expected.\n\n\n-----\n\nAnother threat actor known as BlackShadow was responsible for a recent cyberattack\nagainst Israeli insurance company Shirbit whose data was stolen and leaked. While the\nShirbit attack is similar to the Pay2Key's attacks, it is unknown if they are linked.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Industrial Spy data extortion market gets into the ransomware game](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/industrial-spy-data-extortion-market-gets-into-the-ransomware-game/)\n\n[Quantum ransomware seen deployed in rapid network attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/quantum-ransomware-seen-deployed-in-rapid-network-attacks/)\n\n[Snap-on discloses data breach claimed by Conti ransomware gang](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/snap-on-discloses-data-breach-claimed-by-conti-ransomware-gang/)\n\n[Shutterfly discloses data breach after Conti ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/shutterfly-discloses-data-breach-after-conti-ransomware-attack/)\n\n[Windows 11 KB5014019 breaks Trend Micro ransomware protection](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-11-kb5014019-breaks-trend-micro-ransomware-protection/)\n\n[Data Exfiltration](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/data-exfiltration/)\n[Intel](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/intel/)\n[PAY2KEY](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/pay2key/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\n\n-----\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
