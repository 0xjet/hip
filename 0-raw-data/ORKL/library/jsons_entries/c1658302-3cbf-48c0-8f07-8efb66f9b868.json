Posing to be from the\n\nPalestinian Political and National Guidance Commission, the Word document serves as a decoy,\n\ndistracting victims while the malware is installed in the background.\n\n\n-----\n\nTaking a screenshot of the infected machine and sending it to the C&C server.\n\nSending a list of documents with file extensions including .doc, .odt, .xls, .ppt, .pdf and more.\n\nLogging details about the system.\n\nRebooting the system.\n\nSelf-destructing the executable.\n\nWhile it is not clear exactly what the attacker is looking for, what is clear is that once he finds it, a second\n\nstage of the attack awaits, fetching additional modules and/or malware from the Command and Control\n\nserver. This then is a surveillance attack in progress and has been dubbed ‘Big Bang’ due to the\n\nattacker’s fondness for the ‘Big Bang Theory’ TV show, after which some of the malware’s modules are\n\nnamed.\n\n[A previous campaign of this APT group was uncovered by Talos in June 2017, and since then very little of](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2017/06/palestine-delphi.html)\n\nthis operation was seen in the wild. The Big Bang campaign described below incorporates improved\n\ncapabilities and offensive infrastructure, and seems to be even more targeted.\n\nWhat’s New in Ramallah?\n\nThe first instances of the current campaign began to appear in the middle of April this year. But, thanks to\n\nthe attackers known affection for decoy documents that pose as news summaries, we were able to date\n\nthe campaign back to March 2018.\n\nThis campaign, as well as those in its previous form, uses phishing methods to deliver its reconnaissance\n\nstage malware. But unlike in 2017, this time the malicious attachment is an executable which is actually a\n\nself-extracting archive, containing a decoy document and the malware itself. It is almost superfluous to\n\nmention that in order to give the file a legitimate look, the developers pinned it to a Word icon and called\n\nit “ا����ي �����ا ������ا” (Monthly Press Report).\n\nWhen this file is double clicked, it opens a Word document with the logo of the Palestinian Political and\n\nNational Guidance Commission. This document pretends to be a press report and contains news\n\nheadlines that were actually copied from various Palestinian news websites.\n\nWhile the victim is distracted with the legitimate looking Word document, an additional executable which\n\nis archived alongside the decoy document is installed in the background.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1: Screenshot of Word Document.\n\nAlthough the archive was found on mid-April, the Word document shows that it was last edited on March\n\n29, 2018. This date is also mentioned in the document’s body and used as its title, “29-3.doc”. Theth\n\nmetadata in the document shows that it was also titled “���� ��أ ���م/ �����ا ���دة”, which happens to be the\n\nname of the Guidance Commission Office’s Chief Executive:\n\n\n-----\n\nvictim.\n\nAnalysis\n\nWhile the analysis below discloses the capabilities of the spotted malware, we are pretty sure it is part of\n\na multi-staged attack that targets very specific victims. The malware below is part of the reconnaissance\n\nstage and should lead to the main course, whose nature is still unknown.\n\nAs for the malware’s language, during the 2017 campaign the group used a fairly unsophisticated\n\nmalware, dubbed “Micropsia”, written in C++ and wrapped in Delphi. In this year’s campaign, the\n\nattackers use an upgraded variant of this malware, still written in C++ but wrapped as a self-extracting\n\nexecutable.\n\nThe Executable\n\nThe executable contained in the archive is called “DriverInstallerU.exe” but its metadata shows that its\n\noriginal name is “Interenet Assistant.exe”.\n\nOnce it is executed, the malware ensures its persistence by setting a mutex (“InterenetAssistantN”),\n\ncopying itself to the “ProgramData” directory, and adding itself to the scheduled tasks.\n\nOnce secured, the malware communicates, by default, with a primary hardcoded command and control\n\nwebsite that varies in different samples (spgbotup[.]club). The APT actors, hardcoded additional backup\n\nC&C website (lindamullins[.]info) that is contacted in case the malware does not get a response from the\n\nfirst website. This is likely to be a mechanism that the threat actors implemented in order to handle\n\ncases in which they would have to go through infrastructure changes.\n\n\n-----\n\nPC names, OS version and AntiVirus engines), and exfiltrate the gathered information.\n\nFigure 4: Initial Beacon.\n\nFollowing this, a POST request is sent to the C&C every once in a while\n\n(/api/serv/requests/[base64_fingerprint]), and in turn, the C&C sends back a configuration file that turns\n\non specific functionalities of the malware.\n\nFigure 5: C&C Commands\n\nWhat is interesting is that each key in this configuration file represents a different module in the\n\nexecutable, and when the key is marked as true the executable will run the relevant module’s content. In\n\naddition, the names of those modules are taken from the popular sitcom, ‘The Big Bang Theory’, in\n\naddition to actors’ names from the popular Turkish TV series ‘Resurrection: Ertugrul’ (Celal Al, Sonmez\n\nand Gokhan).\n\nIn the configuration file we found thirteen keys for thirteen different modules. However, in our samples\n\nwe could find only five corresponding modules. This could mean that this campaign is evolving and that\n\nthere will likely be more samples in the future that will implement the missing parts.\n\nThe following table describes the role of each module:\n\n|Module Name|Purpose|\n|---|---|\n|Penny|Takes a screenshot of the infected machine and sends it to the server|\n\n\nWolowitz_Helberg\n\n\nEnumerates running processes, saves their names and their IDs in\n\n“sat.txt” and sends the file to the server\n\n\n-----\n\n|Col1|doc, docx, odt, xls, xlsx, ppt, pptx, accdb, accde, mdb, pdf, csv|\n|---|---|\n|Runfile|Runs a file, receives a process name and a file type from the server|\n|Nayyar_Sonmez|Downloads a file with a ‘.txt’ extension from a given URL, changes the extension to ‘.exe’ and runs it|\n|Koothrappali|Logs details about the system and sends them to the server|\n|Bialik_Gokhan|Reboots the system|\n|Hofstadter|Terminates a process by name|\n|Parsons_Sheldon|Deletes the payload from the startup folder and deletes the actual file|\n|Reshad_Strik|Sends a list of the partitions found on the infected machine|\n|Pinar8|No such module in our sample|\n|Mehmet7|No such module in our sample|\n|Bahar6|No such module in our sample|\n\n\nIt is important to note that unlike RATs that try to keylog the infected system and harvest credentials, this\n\nsample shows the irregular behavior of looking for Microsoft Office documents on the victim’s machine,\n\nor enumerating partitions. In addition, the file has the capability of downloading and running another\n\nexecutable\n\nAfter reviewing all the malware functionalities, we are confident in saying that the attackers look for\n\nvictims who answer well-defined characteristics and believe that further stages of the attack are\n\ndelivered only to those who fit the specific victim profile.\n\nThe Attacker’s English Level\n\nThe typo in the file’s name (Interenet Assistant) helped us find another executable with the same name\n\nthat is almost identical to the original one. In addition, using the communication pattern we were able to\n\nfind another sample called “DriverInstallerU”. In this sample, however, the module names were changed\n\nfrom actors and characters’ names to car models, namely “BMW_x1”, “BMW_x2” and up to “BMW_x8”.\n\nBut typos are not the only English mistakes of this APT group. Incorrect grammar phrases in the C2\n\nwebsites also assisted in uncovering the operation infrastructure.\n\n\n-----\n\nresponse:\n\nWebsites related to this campaign use readymade bootstrap templates, but include unique and\n\ngrammatically incorrect strings such as “Probably the most Music Site in the world!”, and\n\n[“contact@namylufy[.]com” in some of the websites.](mailto:contact@namylufy[.]com)\n\nThose strings helped us find other websites that use the same template, and while they could not be\n\nlinked to specific malware samples, it is possible that they will be used in the future.\n\nL ki B k\n\n\n-----\n\ncampaigns maintained evident fingerprints, both in the delivery methods and malware development\n\nconventions. These unique traces assisted us in correlating the current wave to past attacks, and may\n\nalso have some resemblance to attacks related to the Gaza Cybergang APT group.\n\nDuring our investigation we spotted three instances of the renewed operation, but unique artifacts in the\n\ncommand and control website revealed a wider infrastructure that may well manage more unknown\n\nsamples.\n\nIn addition, the concept of using self-extracting archives and decoy documents is not groundbreaking or\n\nnew, as we have seen similar attacks being carried in the past by the Gaza Cybergang APT group.\n\nThere were, however, many similarities between the samples we found and the ones which were found\n\nduring the 2017 campaign, such as the usage of actor and character names from renowned TV series, as\n\nwell as fingerprinting the system and sending the information to the C&C. According to Talos, those files\n\nwere distributed to victims in the Palestinian law enforcement agencies during 2017.\n\nHowever, in 2017 the group used an executable wrapped in Delphi, whereas the sample we found uses a\n\nself-extracting archive. Both of the above open a document as well as another executable (written in C++)\n\nwhen they are double clicked.\n\nFinally, the C&C communication has also been improved in the recent campaign, as backup domains did\n\nnot appear in the old ones. In addition, the newer malware strain has stronger capabilities and a wider\n\nfunctionality than the older one, which would only send information about the system version.\n\nConclusion\n\nWith the experience gained from the APT attack that began in March 2017, it seems this campaign has\n\nevolved into an attack with new capabilities, and an even more specific target, over a year later.\n\nAlthough the group behind it seems to be focused on carefully selecting their victims, using a custom\nmade info-stealer for intelligence gathering operations, due to its very nature it is difficult to assert what\n\nthe ultimate goal of this campaign is. Indeed, the next stages of the attack may even still be in the works,\n\nnot yet deployed or only deployed to selected few victims.\n\nIn addition, although the clear fingerprints of the perpetrators leave no doubt we are witnessing the\n\ncomeback of the same APT, it is still not yet confirmed exactly who the threat group behind this campaign\n\nactually is. As no concrete attribution has yet been made, due to the shared interests and malware\n\nfeatures of both 2017 and 2018 campaigns, the Gaza Cybergang may be a good starting point for further\n\nresearch.\n\n\n-----\n\nIndicators of Compromise\n\na210ac6ea0406d81fa5682e86997be25c73e9d1b\n\n994ebbe444183e0d67b13f91d75b0f9bcfb011db\n\n74ea60b4e269817168e107bdccc42b3a1193c1e6\n\n511bec782be41e85a013cbea95725d5807e3c2f2\n\n9e093a5b34c4e5dea59e374b409173565dc3b05b\n\nlindamullins[.]info\n\nspgbotup[.]club\n\nnamyyeatop[.]club\n\nnamybotter[.]info\n\nsanjynono[.]website\n\nexvsnomy[.]club\n\nezofiezo[.]website\n\nhitmesanjjoy[.]pro\n\n\n## PUBLICATIONS TOOLS\n\n[SANDBLAST FILE ANALYSIS](https://threatemulation.checkpoint.com/)\n\n[URL CATEGORIZATION](https://www.checkpoint.com/urlcat/)\n\n[INSTANT SECURITY ASSESSMENT](https://www.cpcheckme.com/checkme/)\n\n[LIVE THREAT MAP](https://threatmap.checkpoint.com/ThreatPortal/livemap.html)\n\n\n-----\n\n[RESEARCH PUBLICATIONS](https://research.checkpoint.com/category/threat-research/)\n\n[INCIDENT RESPONSE](https://research.checkpoint.com/category/incident-response/)\n\n[IPS ADVISORIES](https://www.checkpoint.com/advisories/)\n\n[CHECK POINT BLOG](https://blog.checkpoint.com/)\n\n[DEMOS](https://research.checkpoint.com/category/demos/)\n\n© 1994-2018 Check Point Software Technologies LTD.
