Security practices that mitigate ransomware attacks offer protection_\n_against WhisperGate. Friday, January 21, 2022 By: Counter Threat Unit Research Team_\nDestructive wiper attacks typically occur along geopolitical fault lines. Although some of\nthese attacks masquerade as ransomware, there is a fundamental difference. Cybercriminals\ndistribute ransomware to steal (or hold hostage) data that they can attempt to monetize. In\n\n\n-----\n\nwiper attacks, the malware destroys data and renders it irretrievable. Wiper attacks are\nusually conducted by government-sponsored threat actors to serve political interests, not to\ngenerate profit.\n\n## Historical wiper attacks\n\nThe Shamoon wiper attacks in 2012, 2016, and 2017 were Iran's response to perceived\n[regional adversaries. North Korean wiper attacks on South Korean organizations mirrored](https://www.secureworks.com/research/wiper-malware-analysis-attacking-korean-financial-sector)\nthe military conflict between those countries. Even the 2014 attack on Sony Pictures\nEntertainment was retribution by North Korea against a movie studio for perceived offense\nagainst a political leader. Russian wiper attacks targeting Ukraine in 2015 and 2016 were\n[followed by the infamous 2017 NotPetya attacks. While it's unlikely that the NotPetya threat](https://www.secureworks.com/blog/notpetya-campaign-what-we-know-about-the-latest-global-ransomware-attack)\nactors intended its global impact and financial costs, it's clear they intended the malware to\nhave a significant impact to Ukraine.\n\n## WhisperGate versus NotPetya\n\nThe WhisperGate wiper deployed in Ukraine on January 13, 2022 was another example of\n[an attack serving political interests. WhisperGate is not a wiper-worm like NotPetya or WCry](https://www.secureworks.com/research/wcry-ransomware-analysis)\n(also known as WannaCry). It doesn't have the [SMB-based propagation mechanisms that](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1210/)\nmade those worms so successful at spreading. The threat actors deliberately deployed\nWhisperGate to targeted organizations.\n\nOne [reported attack vector used to deploy WhisperGate was a supply chain attack against a](https://twitter.com/dsszzi/status/1483062218501640198)\ntechnology service provider. Details are limited as of this publication, but available evidence\nsuggests that the supply chain attack involved a traditional compromise of the service\nprovider. The threat actors then likely leveraged credentials and accesses from the provider's\nnetwork to compromise its customers.\n\nIn contrast, NotPetya was delivered indiscriminately via a more sophisticated supply chain\nattack involving an accounting software provider. The threat actors used the legitimate\nsoftware update mechanism to distribute and execute a weaponized update. NotPetya\nwormed its way across networks, rapidly escaping the intended geographic confines of\nUkraine to infect networks and organizations globally.\n\n## Similarities between WhisperGate and ransomware attacks\n\nSome of the tactics and attack vectors used in the WhisperGate attacks are similar to those\nused in ransomware attacks:\n\nRansomware is often deployed to targeted organizations directly, just as WhisperGate\nwas deliberately deployed to victims.\nSecureworks® Counter Threat Unit™ (CTU) researchers have observed threat actors\ncompromising service providers to deploy ransomware.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Some organizations impacted by website defacements likely associated with the](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/01/14/europe/ukraine-cyber-attack-government-intl/index.html)\nWhisperGate attacks were [reportedly compromised via exploitation of internet-facing](https://twitter.com/dsszzi/status/1483062218501640198)\nvulnerabilities. Cybercriminals and government-sponsored actors quickly attempt to\nweaponize newly disclosed vulnerabilities.\n\n## Recommendations\n\nOrganizations with operations in Ukraine should be extra vigilant and review business\ncontinuity and resilience plans. It is unlikely that WhisperGate will impact organizations that\nare outside of Ukraine and are not connected to the geopolitical tensions in that region.\nHowever, organizations such as business partners and service providers in Ukraine that\nhave logical access to customer networks should consider the potential for collateral damage\nthat could spread to global operations.\n\nFor most organizations, ransomware is a more prominent threat. Cybersecurity practices to\naddress ransomware attacks also provide significant protection against a WhisperGate-style\nattack:\n\nMaintain backups of business-critical systems and data, protect the backups from a\npotential ransomware or wiper attack, and regularly test restoration processes\nDevelop a plan to continue operations during a power failure or loss of business-critical\nservices\nSegment networks and limit access to high-risk areas\nKeep systems and software up to date, including applying patches for known\nvulnerabilities as soon as possible on internet-facing systems and leveraging antivirus\nsolutions\nImplement endpoint detection and response solutions and investigate alerts of\nanomalous activity\n\n[For more details about WhisperGate, read the accompanying blog post about the attacks in](https://www.secureworks.com/blog/disruptive-attacks-in-ukraine-likely-linked-to-escalating-tensions)\nUkraine.\n\nIf you need urgent assistance with an incident, contact the Secureworks Incident Response\n[team.
