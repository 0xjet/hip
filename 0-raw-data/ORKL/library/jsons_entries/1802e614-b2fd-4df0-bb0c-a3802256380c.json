    "plain_text": "## Ransomware is a form of malware that targets both human and technical weaknesses in organizations and individual networks in an effort to deny the availability of critical data and systems. Ransomware is frequently delivered through spear phishing e-mails to end users. When the victim organization determines they are no\n\nFederal Bureau of Investigation\n\n## longer able to access their data, the cyber actor demands the payment of a ransom, Cyber Task Forces at which time the actor will purportedly www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field provide an avenue to the victim to Internet Crime Complaint Center regain access to their data. Recent www.ic3.gov iterations target enterprise end users, making awareness and training a critical preventative measure.\n\n# Ransomware\n\n\n-----\n\n### • Execute operating system environments\n\nor specific programs in a virtualized\nenvironment.\n\n### • Categorize data based on organizational\n\nvalue, and implement physical/logical\nseparation of networks and data for different\norganizational units.\n\n## The Ransom\n\nThe FBI does not support paying a ransom to the\nadversary. Paying a ransom does not guarantee\nan organization will regain access to their data;\nin fact, some individuals or organizations were\nnever provided with decryption keys after having\npaid a ransom. Paying a ransom emboldens\nthe adversary to target other organizations for\nprofit, and provides for a lucrative environment\nfor other criminals to become involved. While\nthe FBI does not support paying a ransom, there\nis an understanding that when businesses are\nfaced with an inability to function, executives will\nevaluate all options to protect their shareholders,\nemployees, and customers.\n\nIn all cases the FBI encourages organizations\nto contact a local FBI field office immediately\nto report a ransomware event and request\nassistance. Victims are also encouraged to\nreport cyber incidents to the FBI’s Internet Crime\nComplaint Center (www.ic3.gov).\n\n\nKey areas to focus on with ransomware are\nprevention, business continuity, and remediation.\nAs ransomware techniques continue to evolve\nand become more sophisticated, even with the\nmost robust prevention controls in place, there\nis no guarantee against exploitation. This makes\ncontingency and remediation planning crucial to\nbusiness recovery and continuity.\n\n## Prevention Considerations\n\n### • Implement an awareness and training program.\n\nBecause end users are targeted, employees and\nindividuals should be made aware of the threat\nof ransomware and how it is delivered.\n\n### • Patch operating systems, software, and\n\nfirmware on devices, which may be\nmade easier through a centralized patch\nmanagement system.\n\n### • Ensure anti-virus and anti-malware solutions\n\nare set to automatically update and that regular\nscans are conducted.\n\n### • Manage the use of privileged accounts.\n\nImplement the principle of least privilege: no\nusers should be assigned administrative access\nunless absolutely needed; those with a need\nfor administrator accounts should only use\nthem when necessary.\n\n### • Configure access controls, including file,\n\ndirectory, and network share permissions, with\nleast privilege in mind. If a user only needs to\nread specific files, they should not have write\naccess to those files directories or shares\n\n\n\n### • Disable macro scripts from office files\n\ntransmitted via e-mail. Consider using Office\nViewer software to open Microsoft Office files\ntransmitted via e-mail instead of full office suite\napplications.\n\n### • Implement Software Restriction Policies\n\n(SRP) or other controls to prevent programs\nfrom executing from common ransomware\nlocations, such as temporary folders\nsupporting popular Internet browsers or\ncompression/decompression programs,\nincluding the AppData/LocalAppData folder.\n\n## Business Continuity Considerations\n\n### • Back up data regularly, and regularly verify the\n\nintegrity of those backups.\n\n### • Secure your backups. Ensure backups are not\n\nconnected to the computers and networks\nthey are backing up. Examples might be\nsecuring backups in the cloud or physically\nstoring offline. Some instances of ransomware\nhave the capability to lock cloud-based\nbackups when systems continuously back\nup in real time, also known as persistent\nsynchronization. Backups are critical in\nransomware; if you are infected, this may be\nthe best way to recover your critical data.\n\n## Other Considerations\n\n### • Implement application whitelisting; only allow\n\nsystems to execute programs known and\npermitted by security policy.\n\n\n-----",
