    "plain_text": "**Introduction**\n\nOur worldwide sensor network provides researchers at FireEye Labs with unique opportunities to detect\n\ninnovative tactics employed by malicious actors and protects our clients from these tactics. We recently\n\nuncovered a coordinated campaign targeting Internet infrastructure providers, a media organization, a\n\nfinancial services company, and an Asian government organization. The actor responsible for this\n\ncampaign utilized legitimate digital certificates to sign their tools and employed innovative techniques to\n\ncloak their command and control traffic.\n\n**Hurricane Electric Redirection**\n\nIn March of 2014, we detected Kaba (aka PlugX or SOGU) callback traffic to legitimate domains and IP\n\naddresses. Our initial conclusion was that this traffic was the result of malicious actors\n\n**‘sleeping’ their implants, by pointing their command and control domains at legitimate IP**\n\n**addresses. As this is a popular technique, we did not think much of this traffic at the time.**\n\nFurther analysis revealed that the HTTP headers of the traffic in question contained a Host: entry for\n\nlegitimate domains. As we have previously observed malware families that forge their HTTP headers to\n\ninclude legitimate domains in callback traffic, we concluded that the malware in this case was configured\n\nin the same way.\n\nAn example of the observed traffic is as follows:\n\nPOST /C542BB084F927229348B2A34 HTTP/1.1\n\nAccept: */*\n\nCG100: 0\n\nCG103: 0\n\nCG107: 61456\n\nCG108: 1\n\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; Windows NT 6.1; SLCC2; .NET CLR\n\n2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; Media Center PC 6.0;\n\n.NET4.0C)\n\nHost: www.adobe.com\n\nContent-Length: 0\n\nCache-Control: no-cache\n\nAs we continued to see this odd traffic throughout the summer we began a search for malware samples\n\n\n-----\n\nresponsible for at least some of the strange traffic that we had observed. The identified sample had the\n\nfollowing properties:\n\nMD5: 52d2d1ab9b84303a585fb81e927b9e01\n\nSize: 180296\n\nCompile Time: 2013-10-15 05:17:37\n\nImport Hash: b29eb78c7ec3f0e89bdd79e3f027c029\n\n.rdata: d7b6e412ba892e9751f845432625bbb0\n\n.text: ed0dd6825e3536d878f39009a7777edc\n\n.data: 1bc25d2f0f3123bedea254ea7446dd50\n\n.rsrc: 91484aa628cc64dc8eba867a8493c859\n\n.reloc: f1df8fa77b5abb94563d5d97e5ccb8e2\n\nRT_VERSION: 9dd9b7c184069135c23560f8fbaa829adc7af6d2047cf5742b5a1e7c5c923cb9\n\nThis sample was signed with a legitimate digital certificate from the ‘Police Mutual Aid Association’. This\n\ncertificate has a serial number of ‘06 55 69 a3 e2 61 40 91 28 a4 0a ff a9 0d 6d 10’.\n\nAnalysis of this Kaba sample revealed that it was configured to directly connect to both www.adobe.com\n\nand update.adobe.com. Obviously, this configuration does not make a lot of sense, as the actor would not\n\nbe able to control their implants from anywhere on the Internet since they did not have direct control over\n\nthese domains – unless the attackers were able to re-route traffic destined for these domains\n\n**from specific victims. Indeed, further analysis of this Kaba variant revealed that it was also configured**\n\nto use specific DNS resolvers. This sample was configured to resolve DNS lookups via Hurricane\n\n**Electric’s nameservers of 216.218.130.2, 216.218.131.2, 216.218.132.2 and 216.66.1.2.**\n\nWe found this interesting, so we investigated how these Hurricane Electric’s nameservers were\n\nconfigured. Subsequently, we found that anyone could register for a free account with\n\n**Hurricane Electric’s hosted DNS service. Via this service, anyone with an account was able to**\n\nregister a zone and create A records for the registered zone and point those A records to any IP address\n\nthey so desired. The dangerous aspect of this service is that anyone was able to hijack\n\n**legitimate domains such as adobe.com. Although these nameservers are not recursors and**\n\n**were not designed to be queried directly by end users, they were returning results if**\n\n**queried directly for domains that were configured via Hurricane Electrics public DNS**\n\n**service. Furthermore, Hurricane Electric did not check if zones created by their users were**\n\n**already been registered or are otherwise legitimately owned by other parties.**\n\nAs we continued this research, we identified 21 legitimate fully qualified domain names that had been\n\n\n-----\n\nabove, another one of the poisoned domains is www.outlook.com.

This\n\nvariant had the following properties:\n\nMD5: 50af349c69ae4dec74bc41c581b82459\n\nSize: 180600 bytes\n\nCompile Time: 2014-04-01 03:28:31\n\nImport Hash: f749528b1db6fe5aee61970813c7bc18\n\n.rdata: 103beeefae47caa0a5265541437b03a1\n\n.text: e7c4c2445e76bac81125b2a47384d83f\n\n.data: 5216d6e6834913c6cc75f40c8f70cff8\n\n.rsrc: b195f57cb5e605cb719469492d9fe717\n\n.reloc: f7d9d69b8d36fee5a63f78cbd3238414\n\nRT_VERSION: 9dd9b7c184069135c23560f8fbaa829adc7af6d2047cf5742b5a1e7c5c923cb9\n\nThis sample was signed with a valid digital certificate from ‘PIXELPLUS CO., LTD’ and had a serial\n\nnumber of ‘0f e7 df 6c 4b 9a 33 b8 3d 04 e2 3e 98 a7 7c ce’.\n\nIn addition to sharing the same Import hash of f749528b1db6fe5aee61970813c7bc18 seen in other\n\nsamples listed throughout this post, 50af349c69ae4dec74bc41c581b82459 contained a RT_VERSION\n\nresource of 9dd9b7c184069135c23560f8fbaa829adc7af6d2047cf5742b5a1e7c5c923cb9. This same\n\nRT_VERSION was used in a number of other related samples including:\n\n|MD5|C2|Uses Hurricane Electric|\n|---|---|---|\n|7e6c8992026a79c080f88103f6a69d2c|h.cppcp[.]comu.cppcp[.]com|NO|\n|52d2d1ab9b84303a585fb81e927b9e01|www.adobe[.]comupdate.adobe[.]com|YES|\n|787c6cf3cb18feeabe4227ec6b19db01|ns.lovechapelumc[.]orgns1.lovechapelumc[.]org|NO|\n\n\n-----\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThese coordinated campaigns demonstrate that APT actors are determined to continue operations. As\n\ncomputer network defenders increase their capabilities to identify and block these campaigns by\n\ndeploying more advanced detection technologies, threat actors will continue to adopt creative evasion\n\ntechniques.\n\nWe observed the following evasion techniques in these campaigns:\n\nThe use of legitimate digital certificates to sign malware\n\nThe use of Hurricane Electrics public DNS resolvers to redirect command and control traffic\n\nThe use of Google Code to obfuscate the location of command and control servers\n\n**While none of these techniques are necessarily new, in combination, they are certainly**\n\n**both creative and have been observed to be effective. Although the resultant C2 traffic can be**\n\nsuccessfully detected and tracked, the fact that the malware appears to beacon to legitimate\n\n**domains may lull defenders into a false sense of security. Network defenders should continue to**\n\nstudy the evolution of advanced threat actors, as these adversaries will continue to evolve in pursuit of\n\ntheir designated objectives.\n\n**Related MD5s**\n\n17bc9d2a640da75db6cbb66e5898feb1\n\neae0391e92a913e757ac78b14a6f079f\n\n434b539489c588db90574a64f9ce781f\n\n7e6c8992026a79c080f88103f6a69d2c\n\n52d2d1ab9b84303a585fb81e927b9e01\n\n787c6cf3cb18feeabe4227ec6b19db01\n\n50af349c69ae4dec74bc41c581b82459\n\nd51050cf98cc723f0173d1c058c12721\n\n**Digital Certificates**\n\nMOCOMSYS INC, (03 e5 a0 10 b0 5c 92 87 f8 23 c2 58 5f 54 7b 80)\n\nPIXELPLUS CO., LTD., (0f e7 df 6c 4b 9a 33 b8 3d 04 e2 3e 98 a7 7c ce)\n\n\n-----\n\nQTI INTERNATIONAL INC (2e df b9 fd cf a0 0c cb 5a b0 09 ee 3a db 97 b9)\n\nSsangyong Motor Co.
