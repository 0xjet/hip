[Blog](https://securityscorecard.com/blog)\n\nBy Ryan Slaney and Robert Ames, Staff Threat Researchers and Alex Heid, Chief Research\nOfficer\n\nPosted on August 31st, 2022\n\n**Executive Summary**\n\nSecurityScorecard has identified domains resolving to Iran-linked Advanced Persistent\nThreat (APT) infrastructure, likely to be used to support phishing campaigns against\nEgypt-based shipping and marine services companies.\n\nIn at least three instances, Iran-linked APT actors may have gained unauthorized\naccess to the DNS configuration of legitimate domains to create rogue subdomains.\n\nCNAME records were used to forward requests to unauthorized third-party mail servers\nthat were under the control of malicious actors.\n\nSecurityScorecard assesses with high confidence that these subdomains were created\nto support Iran-linked APT phishing campaigns.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Background**\n\nOn August 23, Google’s Threat Analysis Group (TAG) released a [blog about a new data](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/new-iranian-apt-data-extraction-tool/)\nextraction tool used by an Iranian APT. While the tool was designed to be run locally, it still\nneeded to receive a response from one of two Command and Control (C2) servers before\nproceeding. TAG identified these IPs as 136.243.108[.]14 (Germany) and 173.209.51[.]54\n(Canada)\n\n**Interesting Subdomains**\n\nPivoting on the information provided by TAG, SecurityScorecard’s Threat Research,\nIntelligence, Knowledge and Engagement (STRIKE) Team got to work. We started by looking\nat the C2 IP, 136.243.108[.]14, and quickly discovered that it was hosting some interesting\nmail subdomains. Dig requests for each of these subdomains reveal that they each have\nCNAME record that points to smtp11.smtplab[.]com. Browsing to smtp11.smptlab[.]com\nredirects to smtp11.smtplab[.]com/webmail/login, which displays a Kerio Connect Secure\n[Email login interface. According to its website, Kerio Connect is a mail server and all-in-one](https://www.gfi.com/products-and-solutions/email-and-messaging-solutions/kerio-connect)\ncollaboration tool that is easy to manage and deploy. It is just the right size for small and\nmedium businesses with smaller budgets and limited IT staff.\n\n_Image 1: Kerio Connect login page found at smtp11.smtplab[.]com/webmail/login_\n\nSTRIKE analyzed all the mail servers resolving to IP 136.243.108[.]14 and determined that\nmost are typosquatted domains, attempting to pose as mail servers belonging to the targeted\nentities.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Impostor Domain** **Likely Target**\n\nmail.friendsgroupco[.]net Marine Services Company located in Port Said, El Sharq\nDistrict, Egypt\n\nmail.myegycom[.]com Arabic-language dating website\n\nmail.atlas-shipsupplier[.]com Marine Services Company located in Port Said, Egypt\n\nmail.salamcoshipping[.]com Shipping and Forwarding Company based in Jordan\n\nmail.elcosteelgroup[.]com Steel manufacturer in Port Said, Egypt\n\nmail.maroceanshipping[.]com Trading and Shipping company based in Israel\n\nmail.greenway-egy[.]com Egypt-based organization that provides vocational\ntraining opportunities in Germany\n\nmail.ems-shippingserv[.]com Possible Egyptian postal company\n\nmail.winmarine[.]com Marine Consultancy Service provider based in India\n\nmail.pts-chemical[.]com Unknown\n\nmail.friendsgroupmarine[.]com Marine Services Company located in Port Said, El Sharq\nDistrict, Egypt\n\nmail.sysegy[.]com Possible equipment provider for filtration and heat\nexchange, based in Egypt\n\nmail.elco-steel[.]com Steel manufacturer in Port Said, Egypt\n\nmail.alainspecial[.]ae Center for Care and Rehabilitation based in the UAE\n\n_Table 1: Imposter mail server domains resolving to IP address 136.243.108[.]14_\n\n**Likely Targets**\n\n\n-----\n\nMost of these imposter mail subdomains appear to target Egypt-based shipping and marine\nservices companies. Many of the non-shipping services Egyptian firms listed above are also\nbased in Port Said; attempts to impersonate them may, therefore, still reflect the targeting of\nthe shipping service industry. Port Said is a shipping hub, and professional services firms\nlocated there likely serve the area’s major industries. That being the case, those firms also\nlikely handle data relevant to the shipping and marine services industries and could therefore\nprove to be of interest to a threat actor looking to access such data.\n\nSTRIKE identified a series of domains related to investment in the Eilat region of southern\nIsrael. These domains simply switch an “L” with a “T” (i.e., eilatinvest[.]com/eitatinvest[.]com).\nEilat is close to Israel’s border with Jordan and home to the Trans-Israel pipeline's southern\nterminal, originally built as a joint venture between Iran and Israel back in friendlier times.\nIran was no longer able to use the pipeline after the overthrow of the Shah in 1979 and\npursued a claim for compensation against Israel. The case was decided in Iran’s favor in\n2016, awarding $1.1 billion. Eilat Ashkelon Pipeline Company is one of Israel's most\nsecretive companies. The current wonder of the pipeline, the Eilat Ashkelon Pipeline\nCompany (EAPC), enjoys a state decree that shrouds its affairs in secrecy for reasons the\nIsraeli government says are related to national security.\n\nOther domains appeared to imitate the legitimate domain of a prominent law firm in the UAE,\nwhose clients include H. H. SH. Saeed Bin Mohammed Hasher Al Maktoum.\n\nAll of the typo-squatted top-level domains were registered with the same registration details,\nindicating that they are Wild West Domains resold by a small Egyptian hosting company\ncalled EgWan. EgWan also provides other hosting services, such as email via Office 365.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Image 2: Homepage of EgWan Hosting_\n\n**Rogue Subdomains**\n\nSTRIKE identified three other mail server subdomains that at first appeared to be typosquatted, but further investigation revealed that they are more likely rogue subdomains of\nlegitimate domains. For example, elephantmarine[.]com leads to what appears to be a\nlegitimate website that has been around since at least 2011, currently hosted on IP address\n207.180.247[.]135. However mail.elephantmarine[.]com is hosted on 136.243.108[.]14, with\na CNAME record directing it to smpt11.smtplab[.]com. Two other examples of these rogue\nsubdomains are mail.hhfis[.]com and mail.etisalategypt[.]com.\n\nAccording to Whois information, these domains were also registered through EgWan. To\ncreate a subdomain, one would need to have access to the CPanel, or DNS configuration,\nfor these domains. It is possible that the threat actor managed to gain access to one or both\nof these via an unknown method. Once they gained access, they were able to create the\nrogue mail subdomain, and point it to the same infrastructure as the typo-squatted domains,\nnamely IP 136.243.108[.]14 and smpt11.smtplab[.]com.\n\n**Attribution**\n\nGoogle does not discuss the apparent use of hijacked subdomains to impersonate various\n[Middle Eastern businesses in its recent report on the HYPERSCRAPE tool it attributed to](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/new-iranian-apt-data-extraction-tool/)\nAPT35/Charming Kitten. However, the targeting suggested by these impersonations would\n[be in keeping with Iran-linked APT groups’ established patterns. Suchgroups have, in the](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0049/)\n\n\n-----\n\npast, targeted large industries in the US client states in the region (like Egypt and the UAE,)\nand such targeting likely still serves Iranian regional interests in the present. Thus, based on\nthis targeting and the links to infrastructure used in activity attributed to APT35, STRIKE\nassesses with high confidence that these subdomains were created to support Iran-linked\nAPT phishing campaigns.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\nIt is important to be aware of domain names impersonating your own, as these will likely be\nused to facilitate attacks on your organization. STRIKE recommends using a brand\nmonitoring service, such as SecurityScorecard’s [Cyber Risk Intelligence (CRI), that detects](https://securityscorecard.com/product/risk-intelligence-as-a-service)\nimpostor domains and helps mitigate your exposure to this critical cyber risk.\n\n**About STRIKE Team**\n\nSecurityScorecard’s Threat, Research, Intelligence, Knowledge and Engagement (STRIKE)\nteam now offers Cyber Risk Intelligence (CRI) services in order to provide clients with\ncustom intelligence regarding their risk exposure to issues such as leaked credentials,\nimpostor domains, hacker chatter, adversary counterintelligence, and more.
