The emails are\nusually replies to ongoing email threads, where an attacker pastes a greeting sentence and\nURLs above the original mail content.\n\nAttackers/adversaries do that to improve the social acceptance rate of their malspam. Indeed\nthis strategy seems to be very successful.\n\nHere a sample in English: (URLs are disarmed)\n```\nSubject:  Re: Demande de Remboursement\nGreetings! I send here a recordwith a thorough description of the recent problem.\nPlease examine it here:\n1)hXXps://ooforms[.]com/omnisquod/voluptatummodi-3313010\n2)hXXps://karafarinenovin[.]com/estsit/estsed-3313010\nGudde Moien,\n\n```\nHere a sample in French: (URLs are disarmed)\n```\nObjet : Re: Nouveau dossier// REFTP 27791\nBonne journée! Dans cette lettre, j'envoie le Doc mentionné avec votre signature.\nVous pouvez trouver via le lien ci-dessous.\n1)hXXps://catechismo.ravaldino[.]it/quiatemporibus/ideligendi-1590551\n2)hXXps://tradingview.dharwadinternationalschool[.]com/delectusquia/officiisexpedita1590551\nMonsieur,\n\n```\nIf you receive emails like this, take care. These are links to\nQBot/QakBot/DanaBot/SquirrelWaffle malware, which is a “Information Stealing” / “Cobalt\nStrike Loader” malware. An infection will most likely end up in a ransomware case.\n\nIf you receive complaints about emails like this being sent from your infrastructure, be\nprepared to alert your IT team or IT supplier and feel free to contact CIRCL for assistance.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Root Cause\n\nRecently we had to deal with several critical security vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange.\n\nIn March 2021, CIRCL warned about critical vulnerabilities which were initially exploited by\nan activity group (called HAFNIUM by Microsoft) starting in late 2020.\n\n[TR-61 - Critical vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange](https://www.circl.lu/pub/tr-61/)\n\nIn late October CIRCL got notified about MS Exchange servers vulnerable for the recent\ncritical Exchange RCE vulnerabilities CVE-2021-26427.\n\n[Microsoft Exchange Server Remote Code Execution Vulnerability](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-26427) [CVE-2021-26427](https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2021-26427)\n\nCIRCL immediately worked through the list of vulnerable IP addresses and notified the\nrespective ISPs (service provider) with the request to warn their customers.\n\nSince then, most of the vulnerable MS Exchange servers are patched (updated). But\nunfortunately sometimes patching alone is not sufficient.\n\nIf the server is already compromised before successful patching, the patch will likely close\n[the vulnerability. But the server remains compromised. Patching alone is not sufficient](https://twitter.com/circl_lu/status/1456649440413028353)\n\nThis situation is what we are looking at right now: the infrastructure is compromised,\nattackers read the emails and inject their malicious content into the mail threads by replying\nto the mail interaction.\n\n## Fixing and mitigation\n\nThere is only one single procedure to ensure that you completely fix and mitigate the\nsituation, close all potential backdoors and kick-out the attackers: re-install every\ncompromised server from scratch and then recover and copy the data over.\n\nIn all the cases, we recommend to initiate a full incident response process including the\nsecurity review of the system.\n\nOne of the most important questions which must get answered: Did the attackers manage to\nlaterally move within the internal network. If this happens your are at high risk of a crypto\nransomware or data exfiltration. This means, you will find back all your data encrypted - or\nstolen.\n\nIf you have no resources for incident response and reinstall the Exchange server from\nscratch, Microsoft has published guidance for responders.\n\nGuidance for responders: Investigating and remediating on-premises Exchange Server\nvulnerabilities\n\n\n-----\n\n## Do I need to patch internal and non-exposed exchange server?\n\nYes.\n\n## Have you seen exploited server in Luxembourg?\n\nYes.\n\n## New wave of malspam\n\nUnfortunately the initial ‘Root Cause’ leads to the next stage of attacks. It seems the\ncompromised Exchange servers not only were abused for spreading malspam by replying to\nexisting email threads. CIRCL recently received evidences that the servers also got abused\nfor data breach.\n\nIt seems the attackers exfiltrated a decent amount of emails from the compromised severs.\nThese exfiltrated emails are now traded in the Internet and used to send new waves of\nmalspam by replying to existing email conversations.\n\nHere a sample in German: (URLs are disarmed)\n```\n>\n> Objet: H\n>\n> Schönen Tag!\n> Ich traf Komplikationen mit der Übertragung an Ihre Papiere. Deshalb sende ich es\nnoch einmal:\n>\n> hXXps://sade-cgth[.]az/guufiaq/tdtsl-ttarseaiaobsiumtcuto-aemlaoernoi\n>\n\n```\nIn case your organization was victim of the ‘Root Cause’ you should expect new waves of\nmalspam sent in your name. Please warn all your contacts to be vigilant and not to click a\nlink.\n\nSince this kind of data leak also contains PII - personally identifiable information - we\nstrongly advise to report to the local data protection agency CNPD, as soon as you learn\nabout your organization being affected:\n\n[Commission nationale pour la protection des données](https://cnpd.public.lu/fr.html)\n\n## References\n\n Classification of this document\n\n[TLP:WHITE information may be distributed without restriction, subject to copyright controls.](https://www.circl.lu/pub/traffic-light-protocol/)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Revision\n\nVersion 1.0 - TLP:WHITE - First version - 10 November 2021\nVersion 1.1 - TLP:WHITE - New wave of malspam - 16 February 2022\n\n\n-----",
