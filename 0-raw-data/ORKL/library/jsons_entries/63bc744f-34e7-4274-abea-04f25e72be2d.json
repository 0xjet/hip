The nature and geographic spread of the targets seems to point to a sponsor,**\n\n**or sponsors, with regional, political interests. The attackers, whom we have named Packrat, have shown a keen and systematic**\n\n**interest in the political opposition and the independent press in so-called ALBA countries (Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas),**\n\n**and their recently allied regimes. These countries are linked by a trade agreement as well as a cooperation on a range of non-**\n\n**financial matters.�**\n\n**After observing a wave of attacks in Ecuador in 2015, we linked these attacks to a campaign active in Argentina in 2014. The**\n\n**targeting in Argentina was discovered when the attackers attempted to compromise the devices of Alberto Nisman and Jorge**\n\n**Lanata. Building on what we had learned about these two campaigns, we then traced the group’s activities back as far as 2008.**\n\n**This report brings together many of the pieces of this campaign, from malware and phishing, to command and control infrastructure**\n\n**spread across Latin America. It also highlights fake online organizations that Packrat has created in Venezuela and Ecuador. Who**\n\n**is responsible? We assess several scenarios, and consider the most likely to be that Packrat is sponsored by a state actor or actors,**\n\n**given their apparent lack of concern about discovery, their targets, and their persistence. However, we do not conclusively attribute**\n\n**Packrat to a particular sponsor.**\n\n# Part 1: Packrat’s Seven Years of Activity\n\n**The authors on this report have been independently investigating malware and phishing campaigns in Latin America. This report is**\n\n**the result of discovering that the cases we have been investigating are linked by a common threat actor with targeting in several**\n\n**countries, including Venezuela, Ecuador, Argentina, and Brazil. We refer to this threat actor as Packrat, to highlight their preference**\n\n**for packed, commodity Remote Access Trojans (RATs), and their retention of the same domains and servers over many years.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Image 1: Some of Packrat’s known targets and activity types_**\n\n**Packrat has systematically targeted high profile political figures, journalists, and others in several countries with malware and�**\n\n**phishing. In total we uncovered 12 different malware command and control domains, and over 30 samples of malware stretching**\n\n**over a seven year time period. Packrat also favors an interesting strategy: create and maintain fake opposition groups and news**\n\n**organizations, then use these to distribute malware and conduct phishing attacks.**\n\n**Some of these organizations exist in name only, while others have a more elaborate online presence. Packrat has also created**\n\n**elaborate fake news organizations without any evidence we can find of malware or phishing activity.�**\n\n**_Image 2: Packrat’s major activities_**\n\n\n-----\n\n**y** **p** **g** **p** **gy**\n\n**activities. For a detailed chronology of the malware used, see 3. The Evolution of Packrat’s Implants.**\n\n## Packrat’s Greatest Hits\n\n**2008-2013**\n\n**Tools and infrastructure used by Packrat suggest that they have been active since at least 2008. During this period, Packrat used**\n\n**hosting services in Brazil, and some of their malware samples were uploaded from Brazilian IP space to popular online virus**\n\n**scanning services. Some of the messages they sent also contained Brazilian bait content. While this is suggestive of Brazilian**\n\n**targeting, we have yet to find confirmed victims from this period.�**\n\n**2014**\n\n**By 2014, Packrat was targeting high-profile Argentine lawyer Alberto Nisman, and well-known investigative journalist and television�**\n\n**news host, Jorge Lanata. Maximo Kirchner, son of Argentina’s president, also announced that he was targeted. The screenshot he**\n\n**released of the phishing email he received is consistent with what we have seen, although we have not been able to verify his**\n\n**claims. In addition, a number of phishing domains with Ecuadorian and Venezuelan targeting that we identified became active�**\n\n**during this period.**\n\n**2015**\n\n**2015 seems to have marked an extensive campaign of phishing and malware attacks targeting civil society and public figures,�**\n\n**including parliamentarians in Ecuador. We observed a range of phishing domains and attacks, often using fake organizations during**\n\n**this period. We also found fake organizations and possible disinformation campaigns with targets in Ecuador, Venezuela and the**\n\n**Venezuelan diaspora.**\n\n## 1.1 Nisman and the Argentine Cases\n\n**[In January 2015, controversial Argentine prosecutor Alberto Nisman was found dead of a gunshot under suspicious circumstances.](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/02/07/world/americas/argentina-alberto-nisman-case.html?_r=0)**\n\n**Argentine news reported that a malicious file was found on his Android phone by the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Police forensic lab.�**\n\n**[The file was named� “estrictamente secreto y confidencial.pdf.jar�,” or “strictly secret and confidential” in English.�](https://theintercept.com/2015/08/21/inside-the-spyware-campaign-against-argentine-troublemakers-including-alberto-nisman/)**\n\n**[An identically titled file was uploaded to VirusTotal� from Argentina on the 29th of May, 2015. The file was a remote access toolkit,�](https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/aa9aa05af8df2cc99eb936e2d17623a68abdbb60606bb097379457c4a3760116/analysis/)**\n\n**known as AlienSpy, which allowed an attacker the ability to record the activities of a target, access their email, their webcam, and**\n\n**more. However, the file was built for the Windows operating system, and could not have infected Nisman’s Android phone.�**\n\n**[The initial analysis of the alienspy implant by Morgan Marquis–Boire revealed the command and control server of the attackers to be](https://theintercept.com/2015/08/21/inside-the-spyware-campaign-against-argentine-troublemakers-including-alberto-nisman/)**\n\n**deyrep24.ddns.net. In addition to the malware apparently used to target Nisman, Lanata, and Kirchner (see below), three other**\n\n**samples[[1]] were found which used deyrep24.ddns.net as a command and control domain. One of these, 3 MAR PROYECTO**\n\n**GRIPEN.docx.jar, was a build of AlienSpy (See Packrat’s Implants) which masqueraded as a document containing**\n\n**communication between Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa and Ecuador’s Ambassador to Sweden concerning the acquisition of**\n\n**fighter jets.�**\n\n**[After the finding was made public�, other targets came forward. Prominent investigative journalist and television host Jorge Lanata](https://theintercept.com/2015/08/21/inside-the-spyware-campaign-against-argentine-troublemakers-including-alberto-nisman/)**\n\n**[revealed that he too had been targeted by the same malware. The president’s son, Maximo Kirchner, also claimed to have been](http://pastebin.com/iiAGSMYc)**\n\n**[targeted. We were unable to verify Kirchner’s claim, however, a screenshot showing his targeting was included in a report of this](http://www.ambito.com/noticia.asp?id=803749)**\n\n**claim:**\n\n**_[Image 3: A screenshot included in this report showing Maximo Kirchner’s](http://www.ambito.com/noticia.asp?id=803749)_**\n\n**_targeting_**\n\n\n-----\n\n**[(c aud obo ad o88@g](mailto:claudiobonadio88@gmail.com)** **a co** **) pu po ts to be** **e** **o** **judge C aud o** **o ad o** **s s** **a to t e ta get g o** **a ata,** **o a so**\n\n**[received an email also claiming to be from Claudio Bonadio (cfed.bonadio@gmail.com).](mailto:cfed.bonadio@gmail.com)**\n\n## 1.2 Ecuadorian Campaigns\n\n**In 2015, we began independently receiving a growing number of reports of phishing attacks via e-mail and SMS targeting journalists**\n\n**and other public figures in Ecuador. Some emails we examined had no political content, but were simple credential phishing for�**\n\n**social media and email providers, like Gmail. Others, however, had explicit political content concerning a range of political figures�**\n\n**and issues in Ecuador. Further investigation revealed an extensive campaign, as well as many fake organizations (See Section 6:**\n\n**Possible Deception Operations).**\n\n**One of the authors developed a Gmail search query for strings associated with the attacks (See Appendix A: The Search Query).**\n\n**We shared this query with many potential targets, resulting in hits for phishing attacks, as well as suspicious Microsoft Word**\n\n**(DOCX) files sent to a range of journalists and public figures. These documents contained embedded RATs written in Java,�**\n\n**including Adzok and AlienSpy (See Packrat’s Implants). Subsequently, using indicators found in the JAR files, as well as an�**\n\n**updated Gmail query we were able to identify a larger set of malicious files and domains used by Packrat (See �Appendix B:**\n\n**Malware Samples).**\n\n**We found a dense web of interconnections between phishing and malware sites. Sites often shared registration information, or were**\n\n**hosted from the same servers. We determined that the malware samples typically communicated with daynews.sytes.net, which is**\n\n**linked to the Argentine cases. Ultimately, investigation of this infrastructure also revealed malware and infrastructure in Brazil, and**\n\n**fake sites in Venezuela.**\n\n## 1.3 Shared Command & Control Infrastructure\n\n**This section describes Packrat’s command and control infrastructure in narrative form, Appendix B provides a full list of Command**\n\n**& Control domains along with the related binaries and malware families.**\n\n**Packrat’s deyrep24.ddns.net domain was created on November 7th, 2014, and at the time of Nisman’s targeting, pointed to the IP**\n\n**address: 50.62.133.49. This IP address belongs to a GoDaddy range for dedicated hosting, and on March 3rd, 2015, the domain**\n\n**moved to another GoDaddy IP: 192.169.243.65. Passive DNS records revealed that at the same time as this IP was being used by**\n\n**the deyrep24.ddns.net command and control domain, it was being used by the domain daynews.sytes.net which had been**\n\n**created on March 1st, 2015. Over the course of our joint investigation we found 5 samples of malware using this domain which were**\n\n**used to target journalists and civil society in Ecuador (See Appendix D: Seeding Domains for a larger list).**\n\n**Packrat’s Command & Control Infrastructure**\n\n**_Image 4: Packrat’s Command and Control infrastructure [Click image for hires]_**\n\n**Searching for domains related to daynews.sytes.net lead us to taskmgr.serveftp.com which on the August 11th, 2014 was at the**\n\n\n-----\n\n**IP address, which was also hosting taskmgr.servehttp.com, and taskmgr.redirectme.com. We found a total of 15 malware**\n\n**samples using either taskmgr.servehttp.com or taskmgr.serveftp.com as command and control domains (or both in the case of**\n\n**several samples). The earliest of these samples had a compile time of December 24th, 2008, providing us with the earliest date we**\n\n**know of that Packrat was active. While it is possible that this timestamp is faked, we have seen no evidence of this on other samples**\n\n**by these attackers.**\n\n**Packrat’s Command and Control Infrastructure**\n\n**Domain** **Relevant Resolution** **Relevant Date of resolution**\n\n**deyrep24.ddns.net** **50.62.133.49** **November 7th, 2014**\n\n**192.169.243.65** **March 3rd, 2015**\n\n**daynews.sytes.net** **192.169.243.65** **March 3rd, 2015**\n\n**190.20.180.181** **March 1st, 2015**\n\n**taskmgr.serveftp.com** **190.210.180.181** **August 11th, 2014**\n\n**201.52.24.126** **July 23rd, 2014**\n\n**186.220.1.84** **July 11th, 2014**\n\n**taskmgr.servehttp.com** **186.220.1.84** **June 24th, 2014**\n\n**201.52.24.126** **July 23rd, 2014**\n\n**186.220.1.84** **July 11th, 2014**\n\n**186.220.11.67** **August 15th, 2014**\n\n**taskmgr.redirectme.com** **201.52.24.126** **July 23rd, 2014**\n\n**186.220.1.84** **July 11th, 2014**\n\n**ruley.no-ip.org** **186.220.1.84** **July 11th, 2014**\n\n**189.100.148.188** **September 6th, 2012**\n\n**lolinha.no-ip.org** **189.100.148.188** **September 6th, 2012**\n\n**wjwj.no-ip.org** **189.100.148.188** **September 6th, 2012**\n\n**conhost.servehttp.com** **186.220.11.67** **August 15th, 2014**\n\n**dllhost.servehttp.com** **186.220.11.67** **August 15th, 2014**\n\n**wjwjwj.no-ip.org** **179.208.187.216** **March 25th, 2014**\n\n**186.220.1.84** **June 24th, 2014**\n\n**wjwjwjwj.no-ip.org** **179.208.187.216** **March 25th, 2014**\n\n**On July 11th 2014, all ‘taskmgr’ domains were hosted on 186.220.1.84, an IP address in Brazil.

We are also tracking active attacks against Ecuadorian targets at the time of**\n\n**writing.**\n\n**_Image 5: Some of Packrat’s known target groups in Ecuador_**\n\n**Using email inbox search queries that we shared with potential targets (See: Appendix A), as well as analysis of malware**\n\n**databases and seeding infrastructure, we collected a diverse set of malware and phishing attacks targeting journalists, public**\n\n**figures, politicians, and other prominent individuals (see: �5. Packrat’s Persistent Phishing Campaigns for examples).**\n\n## 2.1 Previous Reports of Packrat Malware in Ecuador\n\n**There are public reports, as well as social media mentions, that point to politically-linked malware attacks Ecuador by Packrat. For**\n\n**[example, Ecuadorian freedom of expression organization Fundamedios reported that public figures, satirical news organizations,�](http://www.fundamedios.org/alertas/periodistas-y-activistas-sufren-repetidos-intentos-de-hackeo/)**\n\n**the director of Fundamedios, and others, had received suspicious messages and phishing attempts. Fundamedios later updated**\n\n**[their reporting to note that Access Now had stated that some of these attacks shared command and control infrastructure with the](https://www.accessnow.org/)**\n\n**malware that was reportedly used to target Nisman. There are also indications on Twitter of phishing attacks and malware. We have**\n\n**been able to link many of these reports to Packrat.**\n\n## 2.2 Common Techniques\n\n**We observed a range of social engineering techniques used to send malware to Ecuadorian targets. In the cases where we**\n\n**observed seeding, we found that the malware was often accompanied by political bait content, frequently relevant to Ecuador’s**\n\n**opposition. In other cases, the seeding was personalized to the intended victim. The most common delivery mechanism was via**\n\n**Microsoft Word DOCX files containing malicious Java. However, in other cases, attackers used fake updates.�**\n\n**Common Seeding Techniques**\n\n**Emailed as attached malicious files�**\n**As links to malware hosted on sites controlled by the attackers**\n**On Google Drive or Onedrive**\n**Popups or fake update notifications on politically themed / lookalike sites�**\n\n**Packrat often uses email senders and websites in its social engineering that appear similar to real persons and organizations. For**\n\n**example, they registered ecuadorenvivo.co, which looks like the genuine domain of the Ecuador En Vivo news website**\n\n**(ecuadorenvivo.com). Packrat then sent e-mails purporting to be e-mail news updates (a practice by the real Ecuador En Vivo) from**\n\n**the ecuadorenvivo.co domain.**\n\n**Packrat also sometimes creates identical paths to real news stories, and hides them under clickable links. For example:**\n\n**Typical Lookalike Domain**\n\n\n**What the target sees:**\n\n\n-----\n\n**http://ecuadorenvivo.co/videos/el-meme-que-volvio-loco-a-correa.html**\n\n\n## 2.3 Three Attacks in Detail\n\n**To illustrate Packrat’s approach, this section describes three recent attacks in detail. The attacks date from between Spring and Fall**\n\n**2015. Targets of these attacks include Ecuadorian journalists and public figures.�**\n\n**2.3.1 Attack 1: Email from a fake opposition movement**\n\n**Throughout April 2015, multiple targets received e-mails from the “Movimento Anti Correista” (English: “Anti Correa Movement”), a**\n\n**fictitious group (based on open source searches and consultation with individuals familiar with the region) that purports to be�**\n\n**opponents of Ecuador’s current president, Rafael Correa. The emails contained a Microsoft Word DOCX attachment containing**\n\n**Adzok malware (See: Section 3. The Evolution of Packrat’s Implants), as well as text and graphics to bolster the fiction.�**\n\n**Example Seeding E-mail from “Movimento Anti Correista”**\n\n**_Image 6: Example Seeding E-mail from “Movimento Anti Correista”_**\n\n**Seeding text translation:**\n\n\n**Subject: Foul Play by Rafael Correa Against the Opposition**\n**Body:**\n**We are sharing with you this leaked document about President Rafael Correa’s dirty tricks against the opposition**\n**(Open on a PC, this cannot be read on a phone.)Coming soon more leaks on: www[.]movimientoanticorreista.com**\n\n\n**The e-mail seems intended for several purposes. It is obviously designed to trick the target into downloading and viewing the**\n\n**document, but it also seems to be an effort to establish the legitimacy of the domain, and the identity of the movement.**\n\n**The Malicious Attachment**\n\n\n**Name La jugada sucia De Correa ante la oposición.ppt**\n**Type: Microsoft Word Document file (.docx)�**\n**MD5: ea7bcf58a4ccdecb0c64e56b9998a4ac**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Image 7: Seeding email with text_**\n\n**[Embedded in this document is software called “Adzok – Invisible Remote Administrator.” Analysis of the malware can be found in](http://adzok.com/)**\n\n**Section 3: The Evolution of Packrat’s Implants and the configuration of this implant can be found in �Appendix C: Malware**\n\n**Configuration�.**\n\n**2.3.2 Attack 2: You are being spied on!**\n\n**This attack is designed to create a sense of fear and concern in the target, leading to the file being opened. The e-mail is�**\n\n**customized for the target’s name, and claims that the target is being spied on by SENAIN, Ecuador’s National Intelligence**\n\n**Secretariat. The attachment purports to be a list of Twitter users spied on by SENAIN. Interestingly, the purported sender is**\n\n**“Guillermo Lasso,” the defeated challenger in Ecuador’s last presidential election.**\n\n**_Image 8: Email with the purported sender as “Guillermo Lasso,” the defeated challenger in Ecuador’s last_**\n\n**_presidential election_**\n\n**Seeding text translation:**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Note: Open this on your personal computer.

Since Packrat prefers to leave the infrastructure online, they may be trying to discourage unwelcome**\n\n**attention.**\n\n# 3. The Evolution of Packrat’s Implants\n\n**Over the past seven years Packrat has used several different types of malware, much of it off-the-shelf RATs, such as Cybergate,**\n\n**Xtreme, AlienSpy, and Adzok. While these malware families are known to researchers, Packrat typically obfuscates their malware**\n\n**using a range of tools, including: an unknown VB6 crypter, AutoIt3Wrapper, UPX, PECompact, PEtite, and Allatori Obfuscator. This**\n\n**layer of obfuscation means that Packrat’s attacks frequently escaped detection by antivirus when the attacks were deployed. This**\n\n**section describes these tools, roughly grouped into distinct time periods.**\n\n**_Image 12: Packrat malware families_**\n\n## 3.1. 2008-2014: Packed RATS, mostly CyberGate\n\n**Between 2008 and 2014, Packrat made extensive use of off-the-shelf RATs encapsulated in AutoIt3Wrapper, a runtime packer. This**\n\n**packer is written in AutoIt, a compilable scripting language for automating tasks in Windows. The use of an initial obfuscation layer**\n\n**seems to have been enough to thwart or at least misguide detection, as well as leverage some basic anti-debugging techniques.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Many of these attacks included embedded decoy Office documents that are opened at execution of the implant, likely in the context�**\n\n**of a targeted attack. Among the documents we found are résumés of purported Brazilian citizens, as well as purported payment**\n\n**receipts of the Association of Lawyers of Sao Paulo, Brazil.**\n\n**_Image 13: A résumé_**\n\n**These attacks suggest that Packrat had Portuguese speaking targets during this period. Based on the specifics of the bait�**\n\n**documents, it seems likely that they were Brazilian.**\n\n**_Image 14: Payment receipt_**\n\n\n-----\n\n**y** **p** **g** **p** **g** **g** **p** **(** **pp** **p** **)**\n\n**3.1.1 Analysis of CyberGate RAT**\n\n**The CyberGate RAT samples we analyzed were, as mentioned above, typically wrapped in a layer of AutoIt. Code and strings found**\n\n**in the binary indicate that it is based on the Spy-Net RAT version 2.6. This RAT was developed by a Brazilian hacker using the**\n\n**[handle spynetcoder and is outlined on the Spy-Net RAT ‘official’ website�.](http://spynet-rat-officiel.blogspot.com/)**\n\n**CyberGate’s Infection Routine**\n\n**After unpacking from the applied runtime packer, CyberGate runs its second stage, which is likeley the infection routine. This injects**\n\n**the third stage, a DLL, into a running process. Once implanted, CyberGate then deploys a range of techniques for persistence and**\n\n**monitoring.**\n\n**The third stage module picks from three execution paths (based on mutexes, which can also be set by a prior infection):**\n\n**Password gathering (mutex: “_x_X_PASSWORDLIST_X_x_”)**\n\n**Block mouse and keyboard input to any other application (mutex: “_x_X_BLOCKMOUSE_X_x_”)**\n\n**Infection routine**\n\n**CyberGate Anti Analysis**\n\n**The infection routine comes with a set of anti-analysis features packaged in a single function. CyberGate searches for a range of**\n\n**virtual and sandbox environments.[[3]] It also checks for user space debuggers through the IsDebuggerPresent API, and for SoftICE**\n\n**and Syser through their respective pipes. The malware performs breakpoint detection on the function entries of the listed anti-**\n\n**analysis features by checking whether the first byte of each function equals ‘CC’, the bytecode indicating a breakpoint.�**\n\n**_Image 15: CyberGate Anti Analysis_**\n\n**CyberGate Process Injection**\n\n**The infection routine fetches the encrypted implant from the resource section, and upon decryption attempts to inject its implant into**\n\n**the Windows system shell process (explorer.exe). If this fails, CyberGate launches an explorer.exe process on its own, injects its**\n\n**implant into it, and then completes the setup. Additionally, another instance of the CyberGate implant is injected into a default**\n\n**browser process, which runs invisibly.**\n\n**The infection routine drops a copy of itself into different directories, depending on the Windows version: /System, /Windows, or**\n\n**/Program Files. The implant’s name varies: taskhost.exe, regedit.exe, or taskmgr.exe are all common. The infection routine also**\n\n**writes a copy of the encrypted implant into the %TEMP% directory and names it XX–XX–XX.txt.**\n\n**To achieve persistence, the second stage writes registry keys so that CyberGate is run at startup:**\n\n\n**HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Active Setup\\Installed Components\\%GUID%\\StubPath: “C:\\WINDOWS\\System32\\regedit.exe”**\n**HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\policies\\Explorer\\Run\\Policies: “C:\\WINDOWS\\System32\\regedit.exe”**\n**HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\msconfig: “C:\\WINDOWS\\System32\\regedit.exe”�**\n\n\n**Password Collection**\n\n**If tasked with password collection, the second stage binary grabs passwords from a range of locations, including: the No-ip**\n\n**Dynamic Update Client (DUC), MSN messenger, Firefox, and Internet Explorer. The credentials are collected from the Windows**\n\n**Registry, browser profiles, the RAS dial up settings, Local Security Authority (LSA) settings, MS ProtectedStorage, MS IntelliForms,�**\n\n**and the credential store.**\n\n**CyberGate’s Functionality**\n\n**The CyberGate implant runs two instances. The first runs in the default browser process, and acts as the monitoring component.�**\n\n**Meanwhile, the explorer.exe instance serves as ‘watchdog,’ ensuring persistence and making sure the infector binary on disk**\n\n**doesn’t disappear.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Image 16: Searching for indicators of an existing Spy-Net installation_**\n\n**The CyberGate implant comes with the same credential stealing capabilities as the infector, and is extended by routines to spy on**\n\n**Chrome and STEAM credentials as well. Also inherited from the infector, the implant owns the same anti-analysis routine protecting**\n\n**it from sandboxes and debuggers.**\n\n**Beyond the capabilities seen in the infector, CyberGate has a range of features that provide an attacker with a full spectrum of**\n\n**monitoring and remote control functionality.**\n\n**CyberGate capabilities include:**\n\n**Collecting detailed information about the infected system**\n**Activation and control of the webcam and microphone**\n**Screenshot capture**\n**Blocking user input (e.g. keyboard and mouse)**\n**Control over processes, windows, applications, devices, drive, ports, TCP & UDP connections, the clipboard, registry keys and**\n**values etc.**\n**Control over the filesystem�**\n**Download and execution of further binaries**\n**Exfiltration via FTP�**\n**Collection of information on installed security products**\n\n**Interestingly, CyberGate gathers information on installed security products through the Windows Management Instrumentation**\n\n**(WMI) by launching cscript.exe on a hardcoded .vbs-script. The script requests name and version number of installed antivirus and**\n\n**firewall solutions and dumps the data to a file:�**\n\n\n**Set objSecurityCenter = GetObject(“winmgmts:.rootSecurityCenter”)**\n**Set colFirewall = objSecurityCenter.ExecQuery(“Select * From FirewallProduct”,,48)**\n**Set colAntiVirus = objSecurityCenter.ExecQuery(“Select * From AntiVirusProduct”,,48)**\n**Set objFileSystem = CreateObject(“Scripting.fileSystemObject”)�**\n**Set objFile = objFileSystem.CreateTextFile(“%FILEPATH%”, True)**\n**Enter = Chr(13) + Chr(10)**\n**CountFW = 0**\n**CountAV = 0For Each objFirewall In colFirewall**\n**CountFW = CountFW + 1**\n**Info = Info & “F” & CountFw & “) ” & objFirewall.displayName & ” v” & objFirewall.versionNumber &**\n**Enter**\n**NextFor Each objAntiVirus In colAntiVirus**\n**CountAV = CountAV + 1**\n**Info = Info & “A” & CountAV & “) ” & objAntiVirus.displayName & ” v” & objAntiVirus.versionNumber &**\n**EnterobjFile.WriteLine(Info)**\n**objFile.Close**\n\n\n**Collected data is stored in dump files on disk and exfiltrated to the remote server component by HTTP or FTP.�**\n\n**3.1.2 Analysis of XTremeRAT**\n\n**XTremeRAT is commercial off-the-shelf malware, often available cracked, and used to monitor victim machines.

The**\n\n**viewer receives the window message WM_DRAWCLIPBOARD every time the clipboard changes, and provides access to Clipboard**\n\n**contents. Clipboard and keylogger data is dumped to a .dat-file that, along with the configuration file (.cfg), is located in the�**\n\n**[…]\\Application Data\\Microsoft\\Windows folder for the current user.

XTreme RAT comes with preconfigured FTP server credential placeholders�**\n\n**(ftpuser/ftppass) to log on to ftp.ftpserver.com, which are then switched for updated values received from the C&C at runtime.**\n\n**The XTreme RAT implant also creates a mutex named following the same naming scheme as configuration and dump file (e.g.�**\n\n**“RJokLSZBjPERSIST”). The RAT’s configuration is fetched from the .rsrc-section and encrypted using RC4, with the key “CONFIG”.�**\n\n**[The same algorithm and key combination has been seen in use before in other variants of XTreme RAT.](https://malware.lu/articles/2012/07/22/xtreme-rat-analysis.html)**\n\n**This variant of XTreme RAT uses explorer.exe as a container for remote threads to carry out specific functions. Thread injection can�**\n\n**happen on at least three occasions.**\n\n**Possible injections of explorer.exe by XTreme RAT:**\n\n**A ‘watchdog’ thread** **to restore persistence keys, and to locate and run the infector binary.

There’s an outer .jar (Java archive) file�**\n\n**containing a folder named META-INF and two files: Favicon.ico and Principal.class. Upon execution, Principal.class unzips the�**\n\n**contents of “Favicon.ico” (not an icon file, but a .zip archive), and looks for a filename containing “.jar”.�**\n\n**Contents of Favicon.ico**\n\n\n**0doc.jar**\n**1Estrictamente Secreto y Confidencial.pdf�**\n\n\n**Once it finds the right file (in this case 0doc.jar), it drops it to a randomly-named temp file starting with a constant string and invokes�**\n\n**Java to run it.**\n\n**Inside the .jar file from “Favicon.ico”�**\n\n\n**META-INF/MANIFEST.MF**\n**MANIFEST.MF**\n**ID**\n**plugins/Server.class**\n**Main.class**\n**Estrictamente Secreto y Confidencial.pdf�**\n\n\n**[“Main.class” is obfuscated using Allatori, a Russian-origin JVM obfuscator used by AlienSpy.](http://www.allatori.com/)**\n\n**This reads part of an RC4 key from the file “ID.” To this it appends a constant string, then uses the full RC4 key to decrypt the�**\n\n**contents of MANIFEST.MF, which yields the actual Adwind implant JAR file.

The method used to obfuscate these files is more�**\n\n**complex, but ultimately similar to previous techniques. Uncompressing an infected MS Word document reveals a file named�**\n\n**“oleObject1.bin” under the directories word/embeddings. Opening this file, which is a jar, reveals:�**\n\n\n**a**\n**abcdefghijka.class**\n**abcdefghijkf.class**\n**abcdefghijkj.class**\n**abcdefghijks.class**\n**abcdefghijku.class**\n**abcdefghijkz.class**\n**a.txt**\n**b.txt**\n**c.dat**\n**kjmhs**\n**Main.class**\n**META-INF**\n\n\n**Similar to the obfuscation described above in Packrat’s earlier uses of AlienSpy, half the decryption key is in a.txt. The other half is a**\n\n**string which is decrypted iteratively by the abcdefghijk[a,f,j,s,u,z].class files with the method and class names from the caller.�**\n\n**Persistence is achieved by adding the following registry value:**\n\n\n**“reg.exe” (Access type: “SETVAL”, Path: “\\REGISTRY\\MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\MICROSOFT\\WINDOWS\\CURRENTVERSION\\RUN”,**\n**Key: “JAVASE”, Value: “”C:\\Users\\PSPUBWS\\Cas436FlashJava\\RoUndCuBe\\bin\\javaw.exe” -jar**\n**“C:\\Users\\PSPUBWS\\Cas436FlashJava\\Cas436FlashJava\\Cas934FlashJava.**\n\n\n**3.2.2 Adzok makes an appearance**\n\n**Between 2014-2015, Packrat also used Adzok – Invisible Remote Administrator. Similar to AlienSpy in functionality, the java-based**\n\n**Adzok is apparently from Bolivia. The premium version costs $990, but it appears that Packrat is using the “free” version. This**\n\n**version of Adzok does not use obfuscation, which makes it possible to simply uncompress the jar files within the docx and read the�**\n\n**clear-text configuration file. Given the obfuscated nature of the other RATs that Packrat has used, their use of Adzok is surprising. It�**\n\n**is possible that they were having stability, compatibility, or detection problems with other RATs and that Adzok served a specific�**\n\n**requirement.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Packrat is active in phishing, often against the same groups and individuals whom they target with malware. For example, when**\n\n**examining one target of malware attacks, we found this individual had been targeted by dozens of phishing attempts by Packrat**\n\n**during the same period. The same domains and fake identities that Packrat uses to seed malware are also used to serve phishing,**\n\n**although Packrat also maintains dedicated phishing sites and servers.

In other cases, the attackers push harder, warning the targeted user that their accounts**\n\n**will be terminated if they fail to follow the link. In at least one case we observed that the messages contained improperly formatted**\n\n**e-mail addresses.**\n\n**_Image 19: Example of non political phishing_**\n\n## 4.2 Politically Themed Phishing\n\n**We observed a wide range of e-mails and messages that contained content with political overtones. Packrat takes two basic**\n\n**approaches in the attacks we have examined. First approach: create fake political and media organizations. Second approach:**\n\n**impersonate well-known groups and high-profile individuals�. Attacks typically took the form of messages and e-mails**\n\n**containing information either in ‘solidarity,’ upsetting information, or other relevant news. A majority of what we observed seemed to**\n\n**be crafted to appeal to opposition elements.**\n\n**While much of the phishing seems to mimic common free webmail and social media sites, in specific cases, Packrat mimicked e-�**\n\n**mail services of high-profile targets, like the Ecuadorian National Assembly.�**\n\n**4.2.1 Targeting Ecuadorian Parliamentarians**\n\n**A group we believe to be Packrat has operated a phishing campaign that mimics the Ecuadorian national assembly’s webmail**\n\n**portal. This malicious site prompts the target(s) to enter their email credentials, which are captured via formmail, a technique seen**\n\n**repeatedly in the phishing pages we identified (see below).�**\n\n\n**asambleanacional-gob-ec.cu9.co**\n\n\n**Th** **l** **iti** **t** **d** **i** **i**\n\n\n-----\n\n**4.2.2 A Typical Credential Harvesting Page**\n\n**Whatever the bait, the links on the messages typically lead victims (often via a shortener) to a lookalike domain for a free email**\n\n**provider. During the summer of 2015, a frequently observed domain was a lookalike for Google, although there have been many**\n\n**others:**\n\n\n**mgoogle.us**\n\n\n**While the attacks were active, mgoogle.us hosted a Spanish-language lookalike Google login.**\n\n**_Image 20: mgoogle.us hosted a Spanish-language lookalike Google login_**\n\n**Once a victim’s credentials are entered, they are shown a Spanish language note “confirming” that their gmail has been “unblocked”�**\n\n**and thanking the victim for “choosing us.”**\n\n**_Image 21: A Spanish language note “confirming” that their Gmail has been�_**\n\n**_“unblocked”_**\n\n**In other cases, Packrat sends “confirmation” emails to the original victim, congratulating them on “successfully” verifying their�**\n\n**account after credentials are entered. In specific cases, we found that this e-mail arrived several hours before phished accounts�**\n\n**were accessed.**\n\n**While the phishing has used different tools to harvest credentials, we find that Packrat makes repeated use of the legitimate online�**\n\n**website form service formmail.com to receive phished credentials. Formmail is a legitimate HTML-based form processor that**\n\n\n-----\n\n**The attackers control a range of domains that they use to serve both phishing and malware. This section outlines elements of this**\n\n**infrastructure. A more complete list is in Appendix D, but we describe certain domains of interest here. The phishing page**\n\n**mgoogle.us, for example, has resolved to a range of IPs, including:**\n\n**IP** **First Seen** **Last Seen** **WHOIS**\n\n**198.12.150.249** **5/19/2015 6:16:00** **9/4/2015 9:51:00** **Godaddy**\n\n**50.63.202.57** **9/4/2015 12:52:00** **10/8/2015 21:44:00** **Godaddy**\n\n**Of these IPs, the first (198.12.150.249) is particularly interesting. We find that the same IP was used to host a range of other�**\n\n**suspect domains with similar themes. For a full list of associated domains, see Appendix D. While some of these domains are**\n\n**lookalikes for logins, or update pages (e.g. sopporte-gmail.com or login-office365.com) others seem to have a more political angle.�**\n\n**WHOIS**\n\n|IP|First Seen|Last Seen|WHOIS|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|198.12.150.249|5/19/2015 6:16:00|9/4/2015 9:51:00|Godaddy|\n|50.63.202.57|9/4/2015 12:52:00|10/8/2015 21:44:00|Godaddy|\n\n\n**Name Pedro Luis**\n**Organization Reterg is**\n**Address teredotr**\n**City berlin**\n**State berlin**\n**Country DE Germany**\n**Phone +49.454545445**\n**Private no**\n\n\n**The registrant of the site is enripintos123@outlook.es, whom we find listed as the registrant for a range of other domains. All but two�**\n\n**are lookalike to the login pages of major online services, or suggestive of updates to services like Java and Android (see Appendix**\n\n**D). The two exceptions are lavozamericana.info and pancaliente.info (see Section 6. Possible Deception Operations). Both of**\n\n**those domains were registered within the timeframe of other registrations of lookalike or confirmed phishing domains.�**\n\n**4.3.1 Lookalike Fake News Sites**\n\n**The website Ecuador En Vivio (ecuadorenvivo.com) is a legitimate news site, however the attackers control the lookalike**\n\n**ecuadorenvivo.co domain. Packrat has used this fake domain to send emails to targets, either containing attachment-based**\n\n**malware, or links to the site which has also been used to seed malware via a plugin error.**\n\n**[A Twitter user spotted the fake plugin notification in May 2015 and alerted their followers, and included a screenshot purporting to�](https://twitter.com/el_mercioco/status/596141189071577090)**\n\n**show one of the fake plugin alerts.**\n\n**_Image 22: Fake plugin notification�_**\n\n\n-----\n\n**g** **g** **p p p** **g**\n\n**(193.105.134.27) reveals a long list of obvious lookalike domains (See Appendix D).**\n\n**4.3.2 A Fake News Organization: The American Voice?**\n\n**A second interesting domain is lavozamericana.info, which is no longer active.

While the site is no longer active, Google’s cache indicates that a phishing page was hosted on the site.**\n\n**_Image 23: Google’s cache indicates that a phishing page was hosted on the site_**\n\n**While we have received reports that individuals targeted by Packrat lost access to their iCloud accounts during the timeframe of this**\n\n**attack, we have been unable to verify conclusively whether Packrat was responsible.**\n\n**4.3.3 A Fake Opposition Movement**\n\n**A number of the targets we identified had received e-mails and messages purporting to come from movimientoanticorreista.com,�**\n\n**[including the example Attack 1 above.

The absence of Brazil is not necessarily surprising, as it is**\n\n**likely that the attackers, if they continue to phish in Brazil, may be using separate, Portuguese language sites. This provides an**\n\n**indirect window into the location of Packrat’s targets.**\n\n**A majority of clicks (322) came from direct link clicks, rather than link shares elsewhere. While this particular bitly link was not**\n\n**extensively clicked on social media sites, Packrat does use social media for some seeding.**\n\n## 4.5 Note: Lots of Phishing, Not All of it Linkable\n\n**The investigation yielded a high volume of Spanish-language phishing attacks against the same individuals that Packrat targeted,**\n\n**however for a number of reasons we were unable to link much of the phishing activity to Packrat. One of the most notable and high**\n\n**volume campaigns that we identified used the domain �gmail.com.msg07.xyz and masqueraded as a range of account notifications�**\n\n**from popular providers including Gmail. Typically these messages displayed as originating from e-mail addresses like “no-**\n\n**responder@supportgmai1.com.”  In some cases, individuals received these messages almost weekly over long periods of time.**\n\n# 5. Possible Deception Operations\n\n**Not all of the domains associated with this group appear to have been built to spread malware, or to trick victims into entering their**\n\n**passwords. Several domains are extensively built out, and currently maintained, which appear to be designed to convey the**\n\n**impression of active, news media sites. Some of these sites contain ‘original’ news stories and ‘leaks’ about political figures.

Naturally, this raises**\n\n**questions about attribution. This section assesses two competing hypotheses: Hypothesis 1: Packrat is State-Sponsored and**\n\n**Hypothesis 2: Packrat is Not State-Sponsored. For each hypothesis we provide one or more scenarios that we consider**\n\n**plausible versions of the hypothesis.**\n\n## 6.1 Hypothesis 1: Packrat is State-Sponsored\n\n**6.1.2 Examining the Target List**\n\n**The list of known targets is full of influential people whose activities could have an impact on the domestic and regional political�**\n\n**standing of regimes in several countries. Where we have been able to identify individuals who have been targeted, we find vocal,�**\n\n**strong regime critics and independent journalists in Ecuador and Argentina. Interestingly, Packrat has also targeted**\n\n**parliamentarians, and others within the government of Ecuador. This diversity of targets with (possibly) opposing positions is a**\n\n**common theme in the data.**\n\n**In other cases, we find phishing and malware-seeding websites, emails and messages with obviously political themes. Packrat�**\n\n\n-----\n\n**These are the kinds of targets who would be of interest to an intelligence or security service in the region, especially one not**\n\n**equipped to directly and passively monitor all of the communications of their targets. The multiple nations reflected in the seeding�**\n\n**and targeting suggest, further, that the sponsor(s) of this activity would be interested in the opponents of several regimes.**\n\n**6.1.3 Motivation for Disinformation Campaigns**\n\n**We see a range of fake websites touching on political themes, but not obviously used to seed malware. While some of these sites**\n\n**share the same registrations as malware serving sites, they differ by having extensive content, and show no evidence of having**\n\n**hosted malicious files or phishing pages, or of having been used as pretexts for campaigns, as is common with Packrat. The content�**\n\n**reflects extensive effort, as does the backstopping with identities on social media sites.�**\n\n**There seem to be three possible explanations for these pages. First, the pages may be an attempt to create credible fake**\n\n**organizations that can be used to actively promote disinformation, interspersed with real news. Second, the pages may serve as**\n\n**honeypots, used to attract targets, either to identify and possibly manipulate them, or to build trust that could then be used in**\n\n**malware attacks. Finally, the pages may be part of information gathering operations that have other components of which we are not**\n\n**aware.**\n\n**While it would not be surprising for a political movement or well-funded set of interests to engage in these activities in one country,**\n\n**Packrat has done so in multiple countries. It is not clear what group beyond a state, would be interested in this kind of activity, and**\n\n**have the resources to support it.**\n\n**6.1.4 Ability to Pay**\n\n**The hosting and domain registrations necessary to maintain this campaign infrastructure for more than seven years clearly have**\n\n**associated costs. The human labor associated with creating and maintaining the many fake websites we have observed is also**\n\n**costly. This is especially true for the websites with substantial “original” content, such as PanCaliente. Finally, the extensive and**\n\n**personalized targeting clearly reflects substantial human effort.�**\n\n**The cost of this campaign suggests that Packrat is either well-resourced, or has sponsors who can pay for server space and time,**\n\n**as well as the costs of Packrat’s operators. We see no evidence of targeting with out-of-scope seeding materials, such as industry,**\n\n**business or the financial sector. Given the cost of the campaign, it is difficult to see who, beyond a state or an organized entity with�**\n\n**political aspirations, would both want the information, and be in a position to pay for it.**\n\n**6.1.5 Clues That Packrat Feels ‘Safe’**\n\n**When the first reports were published on the Nisman and Argentine targeting in early 2015, some of Packrat’s infrastructure was�**\n\n**exposed. Nevertheless, much of the infrastructure has remained online. From a pragmatic point of view this makes sense. If Packrat**\n\n**had successful implants operational at that time, taking the infrastructure offline would close that access. Packrat would have had to�**\n\n**engage in a process of pushing out updated implants to the infected computers that connected to a new host. This time-consuming**\n\n**process would also be prone to failure and possible detection.**\n\n**If Packrat were afraid of criminal punishment in their country of residence, it would have been natural to take the servers offline once�**\n\n**exposed. Their interlinked infrastructure can be used to investigate, as we did, the broader structure of their campaigns. In the**\n\n**hands of a law enforcement agency, these active servers could potentially be traced back to the responsible parties.**\n\n**The fact that the servers remain online suggests that Packrat is operating purely on practical concerns, which do not include fear of**\n\n**the authorities. We take this to suggest that they may enjoy a degree of protection in the country or countries in which they operate.**\n\n**While it is less conclusive, their taunts of a Citizen Lab researcher also suggest a degree of confidence that these actions will not�**\n\n**have consequence for them. Given their decision to keep their infrastructure online, this researcher may not have been the first (or�**\n\n**the last) to bother them by analyzing one of their attacks.**\n\n**6.1.6 Two Scenarios of State Sponsorship**\n\n**In this section we present two possible scenarios for state sponsorship. The data we have presented in this report could be**\n\n**explained by either of these possibilities (or by the scenario outlined for Hypothesis 2: Non State Sponsor).**\n\n**Scenario 1: A Single State Sponsor**\n\n**There are several possible explanations for the targeting we see. It is possible that Packrat is working for a single intelligence or**\n\n**security service, and that these activities all reflect that service’s targeting. Such a service would, potentially, wish to keep tabs on�**\n\n**many groups, including both its opponents, the opponents of friendly governments, and possibly friendly governments themselves.**\n\n**The strong representation of ALBA (Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas) countries, and their recent “fellow-travelers” (Argentina**\n\n**i** **l d d** **lth** **h it h** **tl** **h** **d** **li** **ti** **)** **th** **l** **ti** **f t** **ti** **b** **i** **t** **ti** **Th** **l** **d** **f th**\n\n\n-----\n\n**,** **g** **g** **[y](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/07/venezuela-parliamentary-election-opposition-win-political-prisoners-amnesty)**\n\n**Some may jump to interpret public reports of malware attacks targeting opponents of the Ecuadorian government as conclusive**\n\n**evidence of official Ecuadorian government involvement with Packrat. They may also point to previous reports that Ecuador’s�**\n\n**[domestic intelligence agency reportedly used the commercial trojan made by Hacking Team to target at least one dissident.](http://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/2015/08/06/apnewsbreak-leaked-hacking-team-emails-suggest-ecuador-illegally-spied-on/)**\n\n**However, the presence of targets within the Ecuadorian parliament and possibly elsewhere in the government challenges any**\n\n**simplistic theory of Ecuadorian government sponsorship, but does not completely rule it out as intra-governmental rivalries or**\n\n**other dynamics could be at play.**\n\n**Scenario 2: Mercenary Work for One or More Government Sponsors**\n\n**The range and diversity of regional targets, which includes the opponents of several regimes, as well as those same governments**\n\n**supporters in some cases, could be taken as indicating that the threat actor group is reusing the same infrastructure for campaigns**\n\n**on behalf of multiple client governments at once. It is possible, for example, that Packrat is in the “address book” of multiple clients,**\n\n**and reuses the same infrastructure for multiple campaigns.**\n\n## 6.2 Hypothesis 2: Packrat is Not a State Actor\n\n**Although some of the evidence we have outlined above provides circumstantial support for state sponsorship, other features of**\n\n**Packrat’s activity are not so clear. This section briefly lays out the most salient of these pieces of evidence: lack of technical�**\n\n**sophistication. We evaluate this fact, and then briefly note a potential scenario for non-state sponsorship.�**\n\n**6.2.1 Lack of Use of technically sophisticated tools**\n\n**The malware used by this campaign is primarily Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) RATs, not boutique or tailor-made implants. Nor**\n\n**is it the commercial malware sold to governments by companies like FinFisher and Hacking Team. Additionally, the attackers do not**\n\n**make use of exploits for their malware seeding. The lack of exploits very likely hampers the efficacy of many attacks. For example�**\n\n**some of the bait documents instruct victims to double click on an icon in the document. This is cumbersome, and is more likely to**\n\n**result in failed attacks or discovery. A threat actor with the direct support of a government might have access to more sophisticated**\n\n**malware, and exploits.**\n\n**However, it is well documented that not all government-linked malware groups make use of sophisticated malware or exploits. Prior**\n\n**research by Citizen Lab, for example, has shown that state-sponsored groups targeting civil society often use the minimum**\n\n**necessary technical sophistication in their campaigns. Why use more sophisticated or esoteric technique when simpler tools**\n\n**suffice? Other research on government-linked hacking groups in the Middle East also suggests that these groups persist in exploit-�**\n\n**less targeting, perhaps because it is inexpensive, and that it nevertheless achieves a minimum satisfactory level of infections.**\n\n**Ultimately, the reliance on COTS malware and lack of exploits does not enable us to draw many conclusions. However, it does have**\n\n**one feature worth noting: by extensively obfuscating COTS malware, the attackers are nevertheless able to deliver malware that is**\n\n**effective at evading detection while simultaneously being difficult to attribute. That said, since obfuscated malware is also common�**\n\n**in criminal hacking, the pairing of crimeware and obfuscators does not tell either way towards this hypothesis.**\n\n**6.2.2: Scenario: Non-State Group**\n\n**It is impossible to reject the possibility that Packrat is a criminal or non-state group. Such a group could, in theory, be a supporter of**\n\n**an opposition political movement, or have other interests in the critics of regimes. There are a range of powerful non-state groups in**\n\n**South America, including cartels and others involved in illegal trafficking, who would certainly have the ability to pay for these�**\n\n**operations. Nevertheless, given the particular targets we are aware of, we are unsure of why these individuals would be of primary**\n\n**interest to groups involved in illegal activities.**\n\n**Another possibility, also unfalsifiable, is that a non-government group with political ambitions is responsible for Packrat. Such a�**\n\n**group might be particularly interested in potential allies or sources of instability, as well as governments.**\n\n## 6.3 Adjudicating between competing hypotheses\n\n**Ultimately, this report does not provide sufficient data to conclusively adjudicate between hypotheses. However, we think that the�**\n\n**best fit, which is still circumstantial, is that the ultimate recipient of the information collected by Packrat is likely one or more�**\n\n**governments in the region.**\n\n# 7. Conclusion\n\n**This report described a seven year campaign with targets in several Latin American countries. While there are many well-known**\n\n**threat actors in Latin America, many of the most visible are engaged in cybercrime. What distinguishes Packrat is the extensive and**\n\n**often ingenious targeting of political figures, journalists and others. They are also distinguished by their ability to remain active over�**\n\n**such an extended period, seemingly unfazed by discovery.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**p** **y** **g** **g**\n\n**Their persistence, and their willingness to keep using domains even after they are exposed suggests that exposure of their**\n\n**infrastructure is not an existential threat. Their threats and taunts are similarly brazen. This strongly suggests, but does not prove,**\n\n**that Packrat operates with a perception of safety.**\n\n**Ultimately, this report does not conclusively attribute Packrat’s activities, however we hope that by exposing their activities, we have**\n\n**provided encouragement to others to continue to follow the thread.**\n\n## Note: The Precarious Position of Media in Latin America\n\n**While we discourage a direct link between specific incidents of non-digital harassment of journalists and Packrat, the case highlights�**\n\n**the difficult situation faced by journalists and freedom of expression supporters in countries like Ecuador.�**\n\n**[In Ecuador, for example, numerous](https://www.hrw.org/americas/ecuador)** **[observers, including the United Nations Special Rapporteur for Freedom of Expression, have](https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press/2013/ecuador)**\n\n**[expressed concern that the freedoms afforded to journalists continue to be constricted. In Ecuador journalists, and even cartoonists,](http://www.economist.com/news/americas/21595946-government-orders-newspaper-correct-critical-cartoon-drawn-and-quartered)**\n\n**have faced apparent retaliation for political speech. Journalist Martha Roldos, for example, had personal e-mails exposed in the**\n\n**press, and recordings of her conversations played in public. Freedom of expression and journalism organization Fundamedios,**\n\n**[which has documented over 600 attacks against journalists from 2008-2012, has face forced shutdown. Interestingly, both of these](http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/sep/09/ngo-alert-ecuadorian-government-orders-press-freedom-group-to-disband)**\n\n**individuals were also targets of Packrat. While we have no evidence linking the perpetrators of these actions to Packrat, nor reason**\n\n**to believe the sponsor is the same, the targeted malware that we describe only adds to the threats these individuals and**\n\n**organizations face.**\n\n# Footnotes\n\n**[1] See Appendix B for details.**\n\n**[2] bc97437fec7e7e8634c2eabae3cc4832**\n\n**[3] Sandboxes include ThreatExpert, Anubis, CWSandbox, JoeBox and Norman Sandbox.
