The report is divided into three main\nsections:\n\n1. The first section gives a summary of incident reports and outlines major highlights for each year.\nStatistics are given for incident response support as well as onsite deployments. Typical incident\nresponse support consists of analysis performed in the Advanced Analytics Lab (AAL) on digital\nmedia, malware, log files, and other artifacts. Companies request analysis support from ICS-CERT to\nhelp determine the extent of the compromise and gather information about cyber attacks including the\nadversary’s techniques and tactics. This information helps asset owners evaluate their security posture\nand take measures to strengthen their control systems and network security.\n\n2. The second section examines the onsite response efforts in detail and gives a summary of each\ndeployment. At the request of a company and when appropriate, ICS-CERT can deploy an onsite\nincident response team to help triage a cyber incident affecting a critical infrastructure\nowner/operators with the purpose of identifying threat vectors, collecting data for analysis, assisting\nwith immediate mitigation efforts, providing cybersecurity threat briefings, and identifying future\ndefense strategies.\n\n[a. See www.ics-cert.org for a listing of publicly available alerts, advisories, monthly monitors, recommended practices, and other](http://www.ics-cert.org/)\nresources.\n\nICS CERT Incident Response Summary Page 1 of 17\n\n\n-----\n\n3. The third section presents common findings from onsite vulnerability assessments and discusses\nsecurity gaps that asset owners should address to improve the secure posture of their systems.\n\n\nPROTECTING INFORMATION\n\n\nOrganizations submitting information to DHS regarding cyber incidents can request that their information\nbe designated as Protected Critical Infrastructure Information (PCII) under the Critical Infrastructure\nInformation Act (the CII Act) of 2002. Under the CII Act, information designated as PCII is protected\nfrom disclosure through a Freedom of Information Act request or through a request under a similar state,\ntribal, or territorial disclosure law and is protected from regulatory uses. In addition, the identity of the\nsubmitting organization is protected from disclosure to the public. ICS-CERT’s practice is to use cover\nnames for organizations it assists (such as “Energy 2” or “Transportation 3”) to obfuscate their actual\nnames.\n\n\n**SECTION 1: INCIDENT RESPONSE SUMMARY**\n\n\nReviewing all incidents reported to and correlated by ICS-CERT from 2009[b] through 2011 provides\ncontext for the industrial control system (ICS) threat landscape during this period. Figure 1 compares all\n3 years and shows the growth in reported and identified incidents impacting organizations that own and\noperate control systems associated with critical infrastructure.\n\n## 198\n\n200\n\n180\n\n160\n\n140\n\n120\n\nIR Tickets\n\n100\n\nIR Onsites\n\n80\n\n60 **41**\n\n40\n\n## 9 8 7\n\n20 **2**\n\n0\n\n## 2009 2010 2011\n\nFigure 1.

Of those, two resulted in the deployment of onsite response teams. An additional two incidents\ninvolved remote analysis by the AAL to identify the threat and recommend mitigation strategies. The\nchart in Figure 2 illustrates the breakout of incidents by sector.\n\n**Dams**\n\n**Cross-Sector**\n\n**1, 11%**\n\n**2, 22%**\n\n**Water**\n**3, 34%**\n\n**Energy**\n**3, 33%**\n\nFigure 2.

Of the 41, eight resulted in the deployment of onsite\nresponse teams. An additional seven incidents involved remote analysis by the AAL. Figure 3 illustrates\nthe breakout of incidents by sector.\n\nICS CERT Incident Response Summary Page 3 of 17\n\n\n-----\n\n**Cross-Sector, 8,** **Nuclear, 5, 12%** **Critical Mfg, 2, 5%**\n**15%**\n\n**Dams, 1, 2%**\n\n**Water, 2, 10%**\n\n**Chemical, 3, 7%**\n\n**Energy, 18, 44%**\n\n**Govt Facilities,**\n**2, 5%**\n\n\nFigure 3. Incident reports by sector (2010).\n\nICS-CERT received multiple reports of secure shell (SSH) brute force attacks attempting to access ICS\nand critical infrastructure companies who operate ICS. Although this type of activity was commonly\nrecognized in the IT sector, these incidents marked an increased awareness of the attack potential and\nattractiveness of targeting ICS. ICS-CERT published a report titled [“CSAR-10-088-01—SSH Brute-](http://www.us-cert.gov/control_systems/pdf/ICS-CERT%20CSAR-SSH%20SCANNING.pdf)\n[Force Scanning and Attacks” to inform asset owners about how to identify brute force scanning and](http://www.us-cert.gov/control_systems/pdf/ICS-CERT%20CSAR-SSH%20SCANNING.pdf)\nattacks, how to mitigate the risks, and when to report an incident.\n\nMultiple spear-phishing incidents were also reported. Reports came from several sectors, but the Energy\nSector accounted for two-thirds of these incidents. All the spear-phishing incidents reported to ICS-CERT\ninvolved sophisticated or advanced persistent threat actors.\n\nSeveral notable threats from 2010 include:\n\n**Mariposa infections in CIKR.** [Defence Intelligence identified the Mariposa botnet in May 2009.](http://defintel.blogspot.com/2009/10/mariposa-botnet-analysis.html)\nAlthough the primary command and control (C2) infrastructure was taken down in December of that year,\nICS-CERT continued to receive malware infection reports into early 2010, at least one of which resulted\nin an onsite incident response to determine whether the malware had breached the control system\nnetwork. The operations executed by the botnet were diverse, in part because parts of the botnet could be\nrented by third-party individuals and organizations. Confirmed activities include denial-of-service attacks,\nemail spam, theft of personal information, and changing the search results a browser would display in\norder to show advertisements and pop-up ads.[c]\n\n**Stuxnet was discovered; ICS-CERT deploys an onsite incident response team to a Stuxnet infected**\n**facility. Stuxnet, the first ever malware specifically written to target ICS, was discovered in 2010. ICS-**\n\n[c. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariposa botnet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariposa_botnet)\n\nICS CERT Incident Response Summary Page 4 of 17\n\n\n-----\n\nCERT analyzed the malware and its impacts to control systems in coordination with various government\nagencies, law enforcement, industry, and other organizations such as Symantec, Microsoft, CERT Bund,\nSiemens, and various sector ISACs (i.e., Energy, Chemical, Nuclear, Dams, Water, Transportation). ICSCERT issued advisories with multiple updates to provide mitigation information to critical infrastructure\nasset owners and operators. ICS-CERT also conducted an onsite incident response deployment to a\nmanufacturing facility infected with the Stuxnet malware and helped the organization identify all infected\nsystems and eradicate the malware from their control system network (see page 8, “Onsite Incident\nResponse Activities” for more details).\n\n\n2011\n\n\n**REPORTED INCIDENTS**\n\nIn 2011, ICS-CERT received 198 reports of incidents. Of those 198, seven resulted in the deployment of\nonsite incident response teams. An additional 21 incidents involved analysis efforts by the AAL to\nidentify malware and techniques used by the threat actors. Figure 4 displays the sector distribution for all\nincidents reported in 2011. Incidents specific to the Water Sector, when added to those that impacted\nmultiple sectors, accounted for over half of the incidents due to a large number of Internet facing control\nsystem devices reported by independent researchers.\n\n**Commercial**\n\n**Information** **Transportation, 1,** **National**\n\n**Facilities, 1, 1%**\n\n**Technology, 1, < 1%** **< 1%** **Monuments and**\n\n**Cross Sector, 49,** **Icons, 1, < 1%**\n**25%**\n\n**Critical Mfg, 1, < 1%**\n\n**Nuclear, 10, 5%**\n\n**Communications,**\n**1, < 1%**\n**Energy, 31, 16%**\n\n**Water, 81, 41%**\n\n**Govt Facilities,**\n**Chemical,**\n**11, 6%**\n**9, 5%**\n\nFigure 4. Incident reports by sector (2011).\n\nMany of these Internet facing control systems employed a remote access platform from the same vendor,\nconfigured with an unsecure authentication mechanism. ICS-CERT coordinated with the vendor to\nmitigate the authentication vulnerability and also took on the task of identifying and notifying the affected\nasset owners. ICS-CERT provided them with details of the risks associated with weak boundary\n\nICS CERT Incident Response Summary Page 5 of 17\n\n\n**Technology, 1, < 1%** **< 1%**\n\n**Cross Sector, 49,** **Icons, 1, < 1%**\n**25%**\n\n**Critical Mfg, 1, < 1%**\n\n**Nuclear, 10, 5%**\n\n**Communications,**\n**1, < 1%**\n**Energy, 31, 16%**\n\n**Water, 81, 41%**\n\n**Govt Facilities,**\n**Chemical,**\n**11, 6%**\n**9, 5%**\n\n\n-----\n\nprotection practices and assisted with mitigation strategies. As a result, ICS-CERT published a new alert\n[titled “ICS-ALERT-11-343-01—Control Systems Internet Accessibility” to update the public on the risk](http://www.us-cert.gov/control_systems/pdf/ICS-ALERT-11-343-01.pdf)\nassociated with Internet accessibility to control system devices.\n\nA similar incident occurred in January 2012, in which ICS-CERT identified an organization that appeared\nto be compromised based on information discovered in open source forums. After analyzing the data,\nICS-CERT established contact with the impacted facility owners and informed them of the open source\nposting of their control systems information. Facility personnel reported to ICS-CERT that they had\nalready discovered the compromise and unauthorized adjustments to the Energy Management System\ncontrol settings that had resulted in unusually warm temperatures in the facility. The organization acted\nquickly when they discovered the intruder and adjusted their network configuration to eliminate Internet\naccessibility. The organization, however, was not aware that sensitive information about their system was\non the Internet or of the malicious IP address associated with the compromise.\n\nICS-CERT also responded to multiple incidents involving sophisticated and targeted spear-phishing\ncampaigns against asset owners in the Nuclear, Energy, Government, and Chemical Sectors. In some\ncases, emails were convincingly crafted and appeared to be from corporate executives or other trusted\nsources in an attempt to lure users into opening malicious attachments or links. Once compromised,\nattackers often map out networks in order to perform a variety of functions including stealing credentials,\nexfiltrating sensitive information such as financial, research or operational data, and establishing multiple\nfootholds to maintain persistent presence for future operations. In all cases, ICS-CERT works with\nreporting organizations to help determine if the control network was compromised and provides\nmitigations to detect and mitigate the activity.\n\nSome examples include:\n\n- ICS-CERT worked with several companies that were part of the Night Dragon[d] attacks, first publicly\nreported in February 2010, targeting global oil, energy, and petrochemical companies. Hackers\nmoved deliberately through the victim’s networks, trolling for sensitive data and intellectual property.\n\n- ICS-CERT worked with several organizations impacted by the Nitro[e] attacks, where companies\ninvolved in research and development of chemical compounds and materials were the targets of\nsophisticated attacks. Reports indicated that the attackers gathered data from across the victim\nnetworks and moved it to internal staging servers to make data exfiltration more efficient.\n\nThese incidents highlight the activity of sophisticated threat actors and their ability to gain access to\nsystem networks, avoid detection, use advanced techniques to maintain a presence, and exfiltrate data.\nICS-CERT also collaborated with the international cybersecurity community working with over\n30 different countries and, in most cases, interfacing directly with the international Computer Emergency\nResponse Teams (CERTs) to coordinate responses and reach out to affected organizations and vendors.\n\n[d. http://www mcafee.com/us/resources/white-papers/wp-global-energy-cyberattacks-night-dragon.pdf](http://www.mcafee.com/us/resources/white-papers/wp-global-energy-cyberattacks-night-dragon.pdf)\n[e. http://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security response/whitepapers/the nitro attacks.pdf](http://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/the_nitro_attacks.pdf)\n\nICS CERT Incident Response Summary Page 6 of 17\n\n\n-----\n\n**SECTION 2: ONSITE INCIDENT RESPONSE SUMMARY**\n\n\nOnsite incident response support to critical infrastructure asset owners and operators impacted by cyber\nincidents is an important aspect of ICS-CERT capabilities. Deploying a team onsite is always conducted\nat the request of the asset owner/operator and only when appropriate thresholds have been met.\n\nICS-CERT provided onsite support to critical infrastructure asset owners on 17 separate occasions: two in\n2009, eight in 2010, and seven in 2011. In all cases, ICS-CERT performed network topology reviews\nwhile onsite, to include a thorough review of the interconnections between ICS and enterprise networks,\nexisting security and logging mechanisms, and interviews with personnel to describe existing procedures\nand common practices. ICS-CERT also left asset owners with recommendations for strengthening overall\ncybersecurity and enhancing incident response capabilities and procedures.\n\n\nINCIDENT RESPONSE GOALS\n\n\nICS-CERT performs incident response with four primary goals.\n\n1. Provide one-on-one support to the impacted organization to characterize the nature of the attack\n(actors, malware, techniques, and tactics) and determine the extent of compromise.\n\n2. Develop guidance for the impacted organization and recommend a path for recovery and future\nprotection. ICS-CERT does not provide direct recovery services but is always available to clarify the\nrecovery recommendations.\n\n3. Leverage the information obtained from onsite response activities to provide situational awareness\nwarnings and alerts to the rest of the critical infrastructure and key resources community (without\nattribution to the affected organization).\n\n4. Collect threat actor indicators, techniques, tactics, and procedures to correlate with other incidents\nand share with National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center partners.\n\nThe following provides a brief synopsis of each onsite response effort by year and by impacted sector.\n\n\n2009 ONSITE INCIDENT RESPONSE\n\n\n**Water**\n\nICS-CERT deployed an incident response team to a municipal water treatment plant that had reported an\nincident that was thought to include a compromise of their control systems network. ICS-CERT obtained\ndigital artifacts, including a hard drive from the suspected compromised host for analysis. Analysis of\ndigital artifacts concluded that there was no targeted malicious activity against the water treatment plant’s\nbusiness or control systems network. The overall cyber defense and incident response capabilities at this\nfacility were low, and ICS-CERT provided recommendations and resources for hardening its security\nposture and enhancing its response capabilities.\n\nICS CERT Incident Response Summary Page 7 of 17\n\n\n-----\n\n**Energy**\n\nAn electric utility detected a suspicious cyber event and requested support from ICS-CERT. ICS-CERT\nperformed memory forensic analysis and provided onsite support. The analysis concluded that the\nnetwork had not been compromised as initially expected. ICS-CERT conducted a thorough network\ntopology review and provided recommendations for implementing better detection mechanisms.\n\n\n2010 ONSITE INCIDENT RESPONSE\n\n\n**Energy**\n\nICS-CERT deployed an incident response team to an Energy Sector organization that was targeted by a\nspear-phishing email campaign, which was successful in compromising and exfiltrating data from the\nenterprise network. The ICS-CERT incident response team performed network traffic analysis, both live\nand historical, to identify additional machines that may have been involved. In total, ICS-CERT analyzed\n11 drives from the affected organization that were suspected as compromised as a result of logged DNS\nqueries to known bad domains. Analysis of the drives produced indicators of a rootkit, malware specific\nto the victim’s network, and characteristics of a known and sophisticated threat actor, all of which\nsupported the premise that this had been a targeted attack. The suspected attack vector was spearphishing, and ICS-CERT believes that it is highly likely that data were exfiltrated from this organization’s\nnetwork. ICS-CERT provided extensive indicators for use by the organization to identify, mitigate, and\neradicate the threat.\n\n**Nuclear**\n\nICS-CERT deployed an onsite incident response team in response to an incident in the Nuclear Sector\nresulting from the presence of crimeware on the enterprise network. The team evaluated six 6 hard drives\nwhile on site and found indicators of malware related to the Mariposa botnet. The infection occurred\nwhen an employee attended an industry event and used an instructor’s universal serial bus (USB) flash\ndrive to download presentation materials to a laptop. The USB drive was infected with the Mariposa\nbotnet and when the user connected the laptop to the corporate network upon returning to work, the virus\nspread to over 100 hosts on the enterprise network. ICS-CERT, in conjunction with the company,\nidentified all infected computers and provided recommendations for eradicating the virus from their\nnetwork. ICS-CERT confirmed that the compromise did not impact control processes or operations.\n\nInterestingly, interviews with the employee revealed that other nuclear industry personnel had also used\nthe same infected USB drive at the industry event and their laptops were likely infected as well. ICSCERT obtained the instructor’s name, contacted him to inform him of the infected drive, and requested a\nlist of attendees for notification purposes. The instructor declined the offer and said that he would reach\nout to the entities himself to inform them of the malware. Unfortunately, ICS-CERT was not able to\nverify if the companies were ever contacted and to what extent they may have been impacted.\n\nICS CERT Incident Response Summary Page 8 of 17\n\n\n-----\n\n**Manufacturing**\n\nICS-CERT deployed an incident response team to a critical manufacturing organization after receiving a\nreport of an intrusion by a sophisticated threat actor into the organization’s enterprise network. While\nonsite, ICS-CERT identified infected systems, obtained log files, and provided mitigation strategies to the\norganization. Through analysis, ICS-CERT determined that the source of the compromise appeared to be\na sophisticated threat actor, based on analysis of the path and mechanism of the initial entry point and\nindicators found on the hard drive images. The entry point was a spear-phishing email with specific and\nhighly relevant content for that organization and a malicious .zip file attachment. Exfiltration of data from\nthe organization was suspected, but due to the lack of available logging, was unable to be confirmed. The\ncompromise did not impact control processes and operations.\n\n**Energy**\n\nICS-CERT deployed an incident response team to an electric utility after receiving a request from support\nfrom the organization. This utility requested onsite support during a scheduled outage to review its control\nsystem and enterprise network architecture, identify potential vulnerabilities, and recommend mitigation\nstrategies for an improved security posture. The utility had noted anomalous activity on its network, but\nhad already completed the initial stages of incident management and had begun to perform the root cause\nfailure analysis necessary to guide business and architectural improvements to its various network\nenvironments. This organization possessed mature cybersecurity capabilities and maintained a high level\nof preparedness to respond to a cyber incident. ICS-CERT provided an in-depth architectural review and\nthreat assessment of the incident after the incident had been contained and provided the utility with\nadditional recommendations.\n\n**Energy**\n\nICS-CERT deployed a team to an oil and gas company after they identified compromised hosts on its\nnetwork that were communicating to malicious IP addresses as a result of a malware infection. The\ncompany received several spear-phishing emails to a number of internal recipients, and indications\nshowed that the spear-phishing emails were opened by multiple recipients. ICS-CERT and US-CERT\ncoordinated a joint onsite incident response and analysis effort. The spear-phishing email included a .zip\nattachment containing a .chm file, compressed binary Help files (that display results information via\nHTML), and exploitation code. Extensive analysis indicated that the compromise was limited to the\nenterprise network and did not extend to the control system network and process operations. ICS-CERT\nand US-CERT analyzed their network topology and provided recommendations for mitigating the\nsophisticated intrusion as well as enhancing their overall security posture.\n\n**Manufacturing**\n\nICS-CERT deployed an incident response and analysis team to a critical manufacturing facility infected\nwith the Stuxnet malware. ICS-CERT deployed a team of analysts to the facility and confirmed the\npresence of Stuxnet on all their engineering workstations as well as several other machines connected to\ntheir manufacturing control systems network. The malware was verified to be the same as the one\npreviously analyzed in ICS-CERT’s malware laboratory. ICS-CERT worked with the asset owner to\n\nICS CERT Incident Response Summary Page 9 of 17\n\n\n-----\n\ndevelop and implement a multi-staged Stuxnet removal process, customized for their network, and\nconfirmed that the infection had been eradicated prior to leaving. ICS-CERT also left the facility with\nprocedures and mechanisms for detecting and removing any future Stuxnet infections.\n\n**Energy**\n\nICS-CERT deployed an incident response and analysis team to an energy sector organization to review an\nincident relating to a sophisticated threat actor and potential data exfiltration from its network. The\norganization had experienced a series of spear-phishing attacks against their users and they were able to\ndetect and monitor the resulting intrusion and the exfiltration of data. The organization had a mature\nsecurity posture which enabled them to quickly contain the incident. The onsite response team helped\nperform a defensive gap analysis of the network using known threat indicators. ICS-CERT verified that\nthe organization’s containment strategy addressed the potential attack pathways and provided technical\nrecommendations for detecting and mitigating future attacks.\n\n**Energy**\n\nICS-CERT deployed an incident response and analysis team to an Oil and Gas company after the\norganization reported that a series of spear-phishing emails targeting members of their organization. It\nwas suspected that information was being exfiltrated. During this onsite response effort, the ICS-CERT\nteam met with the organization to support mitigation efforts from the incident. The organization had\nbegun the initial stages of incident management and ICS-CERT assisted the organization in evaluating\ntheir network topology, understanding the threat, examining logs for indicators of further compromise,\nand discussion of the findings and relevant defensive strategies for mitigating the threat and improving\ntheir overall security posture.\n\n\n2011 ONSITE INCIDENT RESPONSE\n\n\n**Water**\n\nICS-CERT deployed an incident response team to a water organization that reported a compromise of its\nremote terminal server. The ICS-CERT incident response team performed throughout analysis of the\ninfected host and of the associated malware. Analysis concluded that an infection of the remote terminal\nserver had occurred and that the infection was non-targeted and consistent with crimeware, not a\nsophisticated threat. Further analysis of logs confirmed this finding as the logs showed that the infected\nhost had been communicating with known crimeware hosts. The ICS-CERT team worked with the\norganization to identify the scope of the incident and the most probable points of entry, allowing the\norganization to develop a more effective strategy for mitigating future attacks and strengthen its remote\nlog-in practices.\n\n**Energy**\n\nICS-CERT deployed an incident response team to a bulk electric power organization that had been the\nvictim of a broader spear-phishing campaign against the nuclear/energy sectors. ICS-CERT analyzed\nmultiple digital artifacts, including three malware samples and detected evidence of a sophisticated threat\n\nICS CERT Incident Response Summary Page 10 of 17\n\n\n-----\n\nactor; the point of entry appeared to have been an employee opening a PDF attachment of a spoofed\nindustry-specific newsletter, which contained the malware. Following execution, a non-malicious PDF\nwas presented to the user. Command and control was positively identified as part of this analysis and\nICS-CERT provided indicators and mitigation strategies to this organization to detect further infections\non their network and take appropriate defensive measures to combat the threat. The recommendations\ngiven to this organization also included security recommended practices and mitigation techniques\nspecific to the threat actors.\n\n**Government**\n\nICS-CERT deployed an incident response team to a government facility after a malfunction of a PLC\ncontrolling backup generators at one of their facilities. This partial loss of backup power affected nonvital services. The ICS-CERT incident response team performed a security assessment of the government\nfacility’s control systems network and collected log files and other digital artifacts for further analysis.\nICS-CERT confirmed through analysis that there was no evidence of a cyber incident that resulted in the\nmalfunction of the PLC and the resultant impact to non-vital services. ICS-CERT provided the\ngovernment facility with recommend practices to enhance their security posture.\n\n**Government**\n\nA government organization requested support from the ICS-CERT to investigate suspicious cyber activity\ninvolving their internally-managed building management control systems. ICS-CERT provided on-site\nsupport and conducted analysis detected no evidence of malicious cyber activity. The response team\nprovided guidance and recommendations on best practices to improve their cyber security posture for\ndefense against future cyber threats.\n\n**Energy**\n\nICS-CERT deployed an incident response team to an electric utility that had been targeted by a broader\nspear-phishing campaign. ICS-CERT conducted analysis on three suspected malicious PDF files provided\nby the organization. From this analysis, ICS-CERT determined that two of the PDF files were known\nmalicious and made requests to known malicious domains. However, post- analysis of digital artifacts and\ninterviews with utility personnel, including the targeted employee uncovered that all attempts were\nunsuccessful. ICS-CERT provided the organization with indicators to detect compromise based on\nanalysis of the malicious email, and the utility determined that their network had not been compromised.\n\n**Water**\n\nICS-CERT deployed an incident response team to a water utility that appeared to have evidence of an\nunauthorized login to their control systems network. Initial reporting indicated that a pump had failed as\nresult of changes made in the control systems environment. ICS-CERT conducted analysis and interviews\nwith the organization (and their support contractors) and determined that the unauthorized login was in\nfact an authorized user logging into the control system while on personal business in a foreign country for\nlegitimate business purposes. The owner confirmed this as legitimate system access. Further analysis of\nthe network logs and telemetry data on the control systems network found no evidence of an unauthorized\n\nICS CERT Incident Response Summary Page 11 of 17\n\n\n-----\n\nlogin, malicious intrusion, or compromise. ICS-CERT also provided recommendations to the water utility\non methods of improving the security of remote access to their controls system.\n\nBecause of the media attention given to this incident, ICS-CERT later published a [report in coordination](http://www.us-cert.gov/control_systems/pdf/ICSB-11-327-01.pdf)\nwith the asset owner.\n\n**Chemical**\n\nICS-CERT deployed an incident response team to a chemical industry organization that had reported\nanomalous activity on its network. The ICS-CERT incident response team analysis of its systems found\ntwo suspicious files running in memory. ICS-CERT examined network logs for evidence that company\nhosts had communicated with malicious IP addresses during the timeframe surrounding the infection\nperiod and found indicators of compromise in several locations on the network. Based on the indicators\ndiscovered, ICS-CERT concluded that a sophisticated adversary compromised multiple machines and\nuploaded tools onto the network. Review of the network topology showed that the organization had a flat\nnetwork and lacked other defensive technologies for a secure system. ICS-CERT provided\nrecommendations for improving the network defensive posture and the architecture of their network.\nICS-CERT recommended that the organization continue to use improved defensive technologies to\ncontinue to evaluate the full extent of the compromise and eradicate the attacker from the network.\n\nICS CERT Incident Response Summary Page 12 of 17\n\n\n-----\n\n**SECTION 3: COMMON FINDINGS**\n\n\nThis section summarizes key metrics from onsite deployments and common findings from incident\nresponse events.\n\n\nKEY METRICS FROM ONSITE DEPLOYMENTS\n\n\nAn analysis of the onsite deployment events provides some key findings regarding the threat\nenvironment, methods of detection, and incident response activities. These findings highlight areas for\nimprovement in protecting control systems networks.\n\n**THREATS**\n\nThe most common infection vector for network intrusion was spear-phishing emails with malicious links\nor attachments. Spear-phishing accounted for 7 out of 17 incidents. At least one incident involved an\ninfection from a removable USB device.\n\nSophisticated threat actors were present in 11 of the 17 incidents, including the actors utilizing spearphishing tactics to compromise networks. These threat actors were responsible for data exfiltration in\nseveral cases, which seems to have been the primary motive for intrusion. No intrusions were identified\ndirectly into control system networks. However, given the flat and interconnected nature of many of these\norganization’s networks, threat actors, once they have gained a presence, have the potential to move\nlaterally into other portions of the network, including the control system, where they could compromise\ncritical infrastructure operations.\n\nIn 12 of 17 cases, implementation of security recommended practices, such as login limitations and\nsegmenting networks with properly configured firewalls, could have deterred the attack, significantly\nreduced the time to detect the attack, or at least reduced the impact of the incident.\n\n**DETECTION**\n\nProperly developed and implemented detection methods are the best strategy to quickly identify\nintrusions and implement mitigation and recovery procedures. Most of the organizations to which\nICS-CERT responded were not prepared with adequate detection techniques. In 3 of the 17 onsite\nresponses, the asset owners had been notified of the event or intrusion by external organizations. In two\nadditional cases, the incident had been identified by a hired third party (consultant or integrator). For one\nasset owner, server administrators identified unusual activity that led to the discovery of a phishing\ncompromise. Equipment failure was responsible for two reported incidents that led to the deployment of\nonsite response teams. The following statistics from the 17 incidents highlight the value of using\ndetection capabilities to identify a compromise.\n\nTen organizations could have detected the intrusion by using ingress/egress filtering of known bad IP\naddresses or domain names.\n\nICS CERT Incident Response Summary Page 13 of 17\n\n\n-----\n\nIn seven incidents, file indicators were used by the incident response team to confirm the compromise and\nidentify the threat.\n\nIn three incidents, traffic was observed to known bad IP addresses or domain names, allowing the\nresponse team to identify the threat actor.\n\n**RESPONSE**\n\nIn three cases, ICS-CERT responded with onsite deployments to incidents and determined that the attacks\nwere not targeted at the asset owner. In the other onsite response situations, the infection vector could not\nbe determined. Several common issues or concerns emerged during these incident responses. Many\norganizations did not have sufficient logging capabilities enabled and were unable to provide valuable log\ndata for analysis. In some cases, the forensic images that were sent to the AAL for analysis were created\nlong after the event occurred. By then, important timestamps had been overwritten and a reliable timeline\ncould not be established. Similarly, running antivirus scanning after an intrusion can overwrite\ntimestamps. ICS-CERT has developed guidance for preserving forensic data and provides this\n[information (ICS-CERT Incident Handling Brochure) during incident response efforts to help network](http://www.us-cert.gov/control_systems/pdf/Incident_Handling_Brochure_Nov_2010.pdf)\nadministrators preserved forensic data for analysis. Updates are posted to the ICS-CERT web page at\n[http://www.ics-cert.org.](http://www.ics-cert.org/)\n\n\nCOMMON FINDINGSALL INCIDENTS\n\n\nThrough analysis of the findings from the onsite incident response events, the incident reports, and the\nresults from over 150 onsite assessments using the CSET,[f] ICS-CERT has identified common trends in\noperational security gaps in control systems environments. These findings can be broken down into three\nmajor categories:\n\n1. People\n\n2. Process\n\n3. Technology.\n\nThe following sections summarize the most common cybersecurity gaps associated with each of these\ncategories.\n\n**PEOPLE**\n\nAn organization’s personnel can contribute to cybersecurity gaps when they 1) lack understanding of the\noverall security risk to control systems, 2) do not consider the technical and security impacts of\ninadequate security policies or implementation thereof, and/or 3) lack the cybersecurity skills needed to\nprovide protection of its network against cyber attacks. In other words, personnel may not believe the\n\n[f. Cyber Security Evaluation Tool (CSET), http://www.us-cert.gov/control systems/satool.html](http://www.us-cert.gov/control_systems/satool.html)\n\nICS CERT Incident Response Summary Page 14 of 17\n\n\n-----\n\nthreat is credible, or they don’t see themselves as a target, or they lack the knowledge and capabilities to\nimplement adequate protective measures.\n\nCybersecurity gaps can occur when personnel at all levels of an organization do not clearly understand\nsecurity risks to the control systems environment. This includes management, IT operations, security\noperations, process operations, control systems, and incident response operations. Until critical\ninfrastructure organizations see themselves as probable targets and gain an understanding of the threat\nactor capability to penetrate, avoid detection, and maintain a presence on their networks, they will not\nmake the necessary investments in cybersecurity. To address this gap, ICS-CERT strives for improved\ninformation sharing and outreach efforts by continually providing situational awareness to the ICS\ncommunity in the form of alerts, advisories, and briefings.\n\nCybersecurity gaps also can occur when personnel have an insufficient understanding of the technical\nimpacts of inadequate security policies. Organizations often fail to develop common technical and\nsecurity standards for the IT and control systems components of their environments. Without such\nstandards, it may be impossible to create an effective security posture. Organizations should integrate\nbusiness requirements and technical needs when developing security strategies. Changing default user\nnames and passwords on vendor equipment and placing ICS remote logon sites behind firewalls with\nVPN protection are two examples of policies that are readily implemented and will significantly improve\nan organization’s security posture.\n\nGaps in the necessary cybersecurity skills can result from limited resources and funding or from a lack of\nunderstanding of security needs in relation to the organization as a whole. The primary reasons for this\ngap in skill mix often include the following:\n\n- Failure to perform risk and consequence analyses of a successful cyber attack and develop a business\ncase for investing in cyber security\n\n- Failure to hire individuals or a team dedicated to perform security operations for the organization as a\nwhole\n\n- Failure of organizations that have identified cybersecurity subject matter experts to allocate enough\ntime and training to fulfill the role at the required level\n\n- A lack of situational awareness regarding cyber threats and inadequate polices to guide the\nimplementation and maintenance of technical security solutions, such as policies for managing\nremovable media or guidance for personnel to spot and defend against threats from spear-phishing\nattacks\n\n- Failure to consider technical administration of control systems and corporate IT networks as a core\nbusiness function that crosses all business silos. This limits communication among technical\nadministrators, business owners, and technology end users, resulting in gaps relating to how the\ntechnology is designed, procured, and secured.\n\nICS CERT Incident Response Summary Page 15 of 17\n\n\n-----\n\n**PROCESS**\n\nAn organization’s processes can result in cybersecurity gaps for the following reasons.\n\n- Lack of or insufficient incident response planning or processes to prevent or inhibit cyber events,\ndetect intrusions, and preserve forensic data for analysis and recovery strategies.\n\n- Lack of policies or processes for moving security operations from a tactical level to a core business\ncompetency across business functions (i.e., IT operations, security operations, process operations,\ncontrol systems).\n\n- Lack of or insufficient security strategies and policies necessary to develop adequate security maturity\nthroughout the organization. This also includes a clear policy addressing removable media,\nparticularly when and where its use is allowed within the organization.\n\n- Lack of minimum functional and security standards necessary to develop the following:\n\n− Adequate functional IT operational requirements and best practices\n− Necessary security operations strategy and technical architecture\n− Adequate control systems and process operations security requirements plan\n− Adequate training and qualification of personnel.\n\n**TECHNOLOGY**\n\nAn organization’s technology can result in cybersecurity gaps for the following reasons.\n\n- Control systems environments risk assessments do not identify or prioritize most significant technical\nrisks and potential impacts to operations that would support the business case for investing in\ncybersecurity.\n\n- Lack of security management framework, which results in an inconsistent tactical security posture at\neach of the following levels:\n\n− Lack of network segmentation, both physically and logically.\n− Network segmentation using firewalls is a network design approach that offers a number of\nsecurity advantages to an organization.\n− It involves separating a network into smaller functional networks that can than restrict the extent\nat which an intruder can easily move laterally through the network.\n\n- Patch Management\n\n− Lack of adequate patch management policies and practices to address known vulnerabilities and\nensure up-to-date protection of common cybersecurity threats.\n− Organizations should also develop test environments to assess possible impacts of patches prior\nto implementation in the operating environment.\n\nICS CERT Incident Response Summary Page 16 of 17\n\n\n-----\n\n− Lack of configuration management policies and practices to ensure changes to the network\ntopology are tracked and assessed for impacts to security.\n\n- User access controls\n\n− Allowing uncontrolled user logons across network segments\n− Uncontrolled network access by vendors\n− Default user name and passwords not changed in applications, etc.\n\n- Network communications\n\n− Insufficient ingress/egress traffic filtering due to lack of a functional network baseline\n− Network architecture not adequate for security needs\n\n- Firmware\n\n− Embedded systems do not support incremental security changes\n\n- Operating system\n\n− Lack of integrated security expertise (control systems, sec ops, IT ops, process) prohibit\ndevelopment of compensating controls\n− Lack of systems development life cycle (SDLC) by vendor, integrator, or operator prevents\nadequate security controls from being implemented.\n\n\n**GOING FORWARD**\n\n\nICS-CERT and the ICS community have worked together successfully to identify and mitigate malicious\ncyber activity in critical infrastructure assets, but much remains to be done. As discussed, reports from\nvarious organizations enabled ICS-CERT to analyze incident data from their networks and create an\noverall view of the incidents in progress. This would not have been possible without the active\ncooperation of the reporting organizations. ICS-CERT encourages ICS companies to report cyber\nincidents for tracking, correlation, and support.\n\nSophisticated and targeted cyber intrusions against ICSs across multiple critical infrastructure sectors\n[continue to increase. ICS-CERT developed guidance (ICS-TIP-12-146-01) to provide basic](http://www.us-cert.gov/control_systems/pdf/ICS-TIP-12-146-01.pdf)\nrecommendations for owners and operators of critical infrastructure to mitigate the impacts of cyber\nattacks and enhance their network security posture.\n\nIn 2012, ICS-CERT continues to provide situational awareness information about the emerging threats\nand incident response services to assist with mitigation and recovery efforts.\n\nFor more about ICS-CERT incident response activities and to learn more about recommended security\npractices for ICSs, visit [http://www.ics-cert.org or contact ICS-CERT at](http://www.ics-cert.org/)\n[ICS-CERT@hq.dhs.gov.](mailto:ICS-CERT@hq.dhs.gov)\n\nICS CERT Incident Response Summary Page 17 of 17\n\n\n-----",
