    "plain_text": "#### Possible supply chain attack targeting Pakistan government delivers Shadowpad\n\n###### Daniel Lunghi – @thehellu\n\n Virus Bulletin – London\n\n October 4[th], 2023\n\n\n-----\n\n## Outline\n\n###### • Introduction\n\n • MSI installer\n\n • Shadowpad pivoting\n\n −History\n\n −Updates\n\n • Campaign overview\n\n • Attribution\n\n • Conclusion\n\n\n-----\n\n## Introduction\n\n##### • In March 2023, we noticed a detection hit from September 2022 for\n\n mscoree.dll in an uncommon directory\n\n###### −Mscoree.dll is a commonly used name for loaders of Shadowpad\n\n##### • This malicious DLL was embedded in a CAB file, itself embedded in an\n\n MSI installer\n\n • The MSI metadata mentioned eOffice, as well as the name of a\n\n Pakistani governmental entity\n\n\n-----\n\n## Introduction\n\n\n-----\n\n# eOffice MSI installer\n\n###### Analysis of the MSI format\n\n\n-----\n\n## MSI installer\n\n##### • Only two known versions:\n\n###### −eOffice 1.1.20\n\n −eOffice 2.0.3\n\n\n###### Delivered by the malicious installer\n\n\n\n##### • The installer is not signed, which means anyone can modify it\n\n • The installer is only sent to Pakistan governmental entities and is not\n\n meant to be public\n\n\n-----\n\n## MSI installer\n\n##### • How did the threat actor retrieved the MSI installer in the first place ?\n\n • Hypothesis 1\n\n The threat actor found a legitimate installer on the Internet\n\n\n###### −We found a Pakistan governmental website offering eOffice 1.1.20 installer.\n\n Version 2.0.3 was available on that same site between April and July 2023\n\n −The legitimate 2.0.3 installer was uploaded to Virus Total after we published\n\n our research\n\n\n-----\n\n## MSI installer\n\n##### • Hypothesis 2\n\n The threat actor compromised the Pakistan governmental agency\n\n\n##### developing eOffice (supply chain attack)\n\n###### −As far as we know, such agency has found no compromise of its build\n\n environment\n\n −Since the publication of our research, we found 3 different backdoored MSI\n\n installers dropping different payloads connecting to the same C&C\n\n\n-----\n\n## MSI installer\n\n##### • Hypothesis 3\n\n The threat actor retrieved a legitimate eOffice 2.0.3 installer from a\n\n Pakistan governmental entity\n\n###### −It implies that the threat actor had a previous access to at least one Pakistan\n\n governmental entity\n\n\n-----\n\n## MSI installer\n\n##### • We compared the legitimate eOffice 2.0.3 installer and our\n\n backdoored version\n\n###### −3 additional files\n\n • Telerik.Windows.Data.Validation.dll: copy of applaunch.exe Microsoft file\n\n • mscoree.dll: malicious DLL\n\n • mscoree.dll.dat: encrypted data\n\n\n-----\n\n## MSI installer\n\n##### • One additional CustomAction named “TelerikValidation”\n\n • “Type” value ensures the action is executed in SYSTEM context\n\n\n-----\n\n## MSI installer\n\n\n-----\n\n# Shadowpad pivoting\n\n###### Techniques to correlate Shadowpad samples\n\n\n-----\n\n## Shadowpad history\n\n##### • Advanced malware found in 2017 after a supply chain attack on the\n\n NetSarang software editor. Also seen in a supply chain attack against\n\n Asus in 2018\n\n###### −Both attacks were attributed to APT41\n\n##### • In 2019, other Chinese threat actors started using Shadowpad\n\n###### −Among which Earth Akhlut, presented at VB localhost in 2020\n\n\n-----\n\n## Shadowpad history\n\n##### • First version usually involves two files\n\n\n###### 1. Side-loads\n\n\n###### 2. Decrypts\n\n and loads\n\n\n###### Legitimate signed executable\n\n\n###### Malicious DLL\n\n\n###### Shellcode (In-memory)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Shadowpad history\n\n##### • The shellcode is encrypted with a simple custom algorithm\n\n\n-----\n\n## Shadowpad history\n\n##### • The strings and configuration are encrypted with a similar algorithm,\n\n with different constants\n\n###### −Sometimes the algorithm is a simple XOR 0x1F\n\n##### • It is possible to correlate Shadowpad samples based on the constants\n\n used to encrypt the strings\n\n###### −Not 1:1, one threat actor can “change” its constant, or multiple threat actors\n\n can share a constant (i.e. a builder)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Shadowpad history – version 2\n\n##### • In Mid-2020, Earth Lusca started using a new version of Shadowpad\n\n###### 4. Deletes\n\n 2. Decrypts Encrypted payload\n 1. Side-loads and loads\n\n Legitimate signed executable Malicious DLL 3. Encrypt\n\n\n###### Windows registry\n\n\n-----\n\n## Shadowpad history – version 2\n\n##### • The configuration file is encrypted with a custom algorithm involving\n\n the constant 0x107E666D and MUL, ADD and XOR operations\n\n • It seems that all threat actors using this variant use the same\n\n algorithm and constant\n\n\n-----\n\n## Shadowpad updates\n\n##### • In March 2021, the algorithm encrypting the configuration file\n\n evolved\n\n • Instead of a custom algorithm, every item of the configuration file is\n\n encrypted with a unique AES-CBC 128 bits encryption key\n\n • Each key is calculated based on a single 16 bytes-long key\n\n\n-----\n\n## Shadowpad updates\n\n##### AA BB CC DD EE FF 00 11 22 33 44 55 66 77 88 99 77 76\n\n\n###### 16 bytes long base encryption key\n Unique for every sample\n\n\n###### 2 (or 4) bytes suffix Changes for every item\n\n\n##### CryptDeriveKey ( MD5 hash ) with 16 null bytes as IV\n\n AES-CBC 128-bits encryption key\n\n\n##### AES-CBC 128-bits encryption key\n\n\n-----\n\n## Shadowpad updates\n\n##### • Example of encrypted configuration file\n\n\n\n###### • Yellow: string offsets\n\n • Pink: encryption key suffix\n\n • Blue: encrypted string\n\n\n-----\n\n## Shadowpad updates\n\n##### • We noticed multiple samples share the same base encryption key\n\n • We found 10 different base encryption keys, and more than 30\n\n Shadowpad loaders using this encryption algorithm\n\n • 2 of these base encryption keys were related to our threat actor\n\n • We could not attribute most of these (alleged) Shadowpad loaders,\n\n as in most cases we lack the related payload\n\n\n-----\n\n# Campaign overview\n\n###### Post-exploitation tools, targets and stealth trick\n\n\n-----\n\n## Campaign overview – post-exploitation tools\n\n###### • Traces of Mimikatz execution in C:\\Windows\\help directory\n\n • Creation of a RAR archive within the same directory\n```\n rar.exe a -hp1234QWER!@#$ -v5m c:\\windows\\help\\1019.rar c:\\windows\\help\\*.txt\n\n • Exfiltration through BITS service\n\n • The exfiltration server was under control of the attacker from late April\n 2022 to late October 2022\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n## Campaign overview – targets\n\n##### • Three different targets, all located in Pakistan\n\n###### −Two in government/public sector, related to finance\n\n • eOffice was part of the infection vector\n\n −One telecommunications provider\n\n • unknown infection vector\n\n##### • Last week, we found a Shadowpad sample related to the same threat\n\n actor in an oil & gas company in Argentina\n\n\n-----\n\n## Campaign overview – network stealth\n\n\n-----\n\n## Campaign overview – network stealth\n\n###### • Legitimate eOffice makes a GET request to\n```\n https://10.2.101.110:50000/VI/Application/CheckFor\n ApplicationUpdate/1\n\n • Shadowpad malware makes a POST request to\n hxxps://10.2.101.110:50000/5BE96B824C4AD5A\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n# Attribution\n\n###### Struggling with Chinese threat actors\n\n\n-----\n\n## Attribution\n\n##### • Shadowpad being a shared malware family, it is not enough for\n proper attribution\n\n • We searched for links on the infrastructure side: live[.]musicweb[.]xyz\n and obo[.]videocenter[.]org were listed in two public reports\n\n###### − Kaspersky mentions targets in the industrial and telecommunications sectors\n in both Pakistan and Afghanistan, but no strong attribution\n\n − Dell Secureworks attributes a Shadowpad sample related to our threat actor to\n Bronze University (~Earth Lusca)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Attribution\n\n##### • We are not convinced by the Earth Lusca attribution\n\n###### −Domain names do not match Earth Lusca registration pattern\n\n −All Bronze University payloads in Dell report are named log.dll.dat, except the\n one that is linked to our threat actor, named iviewers.dll.dat\n\n −All of the log.dll.dat samples use the “old” encryption algorithm with the\n 0x107E666D constant, while iviewers.dll.dat use the AES-CBC 128-bits algorithm with a base encryption key that we attribute to our threat actor\n\n##### • Bronze University and Earth Lusca are not necessarily the same\n\n\n-----\n\n## Attribution\n\n##### • We searched for further samples or TTPs that could help us attribute\n\n the attack\n\n • On two victims, we found nothing relevant\n\n • On the third one, we found 3 custom malware families\n\n###### − Calypso dropper (named Trojan.Misisc.1 by Dr. Web)\n\n − Deed RAT (attributed to Space Pirates by PTSecurity)\n\n − DriftingCloud malware\n\n\n-----\n\n## Attribution\n\n\n-----\n\n## Attribution\n\n##### • We found no clear links between those malwares\n\n • It is likely that multiple threat actors targeted the same company\n\n • Therefore, we prefer not to make any attribution statement\n\n\n-----\n\n# Conclusion\n\n###### Lessons learned\n\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusion\n\n###### • Application developed by Pakistan government for Pakistan government\n was used as infection vector by an advanced threat actor\n\n • Shadowpad malware keeps being updated and shared among Chinese\n threat actors\n\n • The sharing of custom malware families makes attribution harder, but not\n impossible\n\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusion\n\n##### • Cross-companies collaboration is helpful, especially since the visibility\n\n is different\n\n • The presence of a custom malware is not enough to attribute an\n\n attack: the victim could be targeted by multiple threat actors\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Thank you for your attention\n\n**Don’t hesitate to reach for any question**\n\n\n-----",
