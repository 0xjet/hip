Communication with a C&C server is done over\nHTTP. Content is protected using RC4 encryption. The\ninitial request to a C&C server follows the format, /{5\ncharacters}.php?id={6 random numbers}{12 characters}.\n\n_Figure 6: Initial communication between a PoisonIvy server and_\n\n_client_\n\n_Figure 8: Taidoor network traffic_\n\nPoisonIvy also makes use of “keep-alive” requests that\nare 48 bytes long.

This means that\npattern matching based on the consistent URL path\nSykipot uses can be evaded. Newer versions of Sykipot\nmalware have also been seen using different URL\npaths.\n\nAlthough there have been some minor variations, the APT\ncampaigns and malware discussed in this paper have been\nlargely consistent over a number of years despite detailed\naccounts in a variety of papers and reports. The changes\nthat have been made do affect network-based detection\nbut indicators that work despite these changes still exist,\nalbeit the possibility of generating more false positives.\nContinued monitoring of these campaigns, however,\nprovides threat intelligence that can be effectively used to\nbegin detecting the modifications made by the attackers.\n\n[23 http://asert.arbornetworks.com/2009/08/twitter-based-botnet-](http://ddos.arbornetworks.com/2009/08/twitter-based-botnet-command-channel/)\n\n[command-channel, http://asert.arbornetworks.com/2009/11/malicious-](http://ddos.arbornetworks.com/2009/08/twitter-based-botnet-command-channel/)\n[google-appengine-used-as-a-cnc, http://blog.unmaskparasites.](http://ddos.arbornetworks.com/2009/11/malicious-google-appengine-used-as-a-cnc/)\n[com/2009/11/11/hackers-use-twitter-api-to-trigger-malicious-scripts,](http://blog.unmaskparasites.com/2009/11/11/hackers-use-twitter-api-to-trigger-malicious-scripts/)\n[http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/trojanwhitewell-what-s-](http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/trojanwhitewell-what-s-your-bot-facebook-status-today)\n[your-bot-facebook-status-today, and http://www.symantec.com/](http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/trojanwhitewell-what-s-your-bot-facebook-status-today)\n[connect/blogs/google-groups-trojan](http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/google-groups-trojan)\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter execution, the malware logs in to a Gmail account\nusing the information supplied in syschk.ocx. The traffic\nbetween the compromised computer and Gmail is SSL-\nencrypted on port 443. This means that at the network\nlevel, one can only observe encrypted traffic between the\nhost and Google’s servers.\n\nUsing Burp Proxy, however, one can analyze traffic\nbetween the malware and Gmail. The malware logs in to\nthe Gmail account and sends an email whose content is\nencrypted to another Gmail address. The content appears\nto be the same as that of the file, form.ocx, which contains\na unique ID the malware assigns, the hostname and IP\naddress, the default home page of the default browser,\nand a list of the programs installed in the computer.
