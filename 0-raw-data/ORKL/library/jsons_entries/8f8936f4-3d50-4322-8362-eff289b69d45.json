This malware\nfamily has been conducting well-known overlay attacks by combining advanced features such as the capability to stream\nscreens, record sounds, browse files remotely, keylogging abilities, and the capability to function as a network proxy.\nThese features make it an effective banking malware and a potential tool for spying.\n\nGenerally, this malware operates by tricking unsuspecting victims into submitting confidential and sensitive information\nsuch as online banking credentials, banking security codes, and Credit Card details. Being a banking Trojan does not\nmean that the Anubis malware variant will masquerade as a banking app; in most cases, it is disguised as a third-party\napp. Some of the disguises used by Anubis are fake mobile games, software updates, post/mail apps, flash-player apps,\nutility apps, fake browsers and even social-network and communication apps.\n\nThe list of malware features of Anubis is shown below:\n\nOverlaying: Static (hardcoded in bot)\n\nOverlaying: Dynamic (C2 based)\nKeylogging\n\n\n-----\n\nContact list collection\nScreen streaming\nSound recording\nSMS harvesting: SMS forwarding\nSMS blocking\nSMS sending\nFiles/pictures collection\nCalls: USSD request making\nRansomware: Cryptolocker\nRemote actions: Data-wiping\nRemote actions: Back-connect proxy\nNotifications: Push notifications\nC2 Resilience: Twitter/Telegram C2 update channels\n\nSome of the common delivery techniques that are used by Anubis malware are:\n\n**Google Play campaigns:**\nThis includes Bypassing Google Play security mechanisms and spreading the Trojan using the official app store.\n**Spam campaigns:**\nThis uses SMS or emails with a request to install or update some legitimate application that links to the malware.\n**Web redirection:**\nUsing advertisement on websites, hacked sites, traffic exchanges lures the victim to a fake landing page containing\na malware app.\n\nIn a recent [tweet, a security engineer shared information about a fake antivirus android app camouflaged as a well-](https://twitter.com/ReBensk/status/1387306767202209792)\nknown antivirus and available from an unsecured web source. When users access the unsecure link available\nfrom the search engine for download, it navigates them to an Index page with the file content named as “Avast Antivirus\nULTIMATE 2021.apk”, and on selecting it, users can download the APK file.\n\nOn scanning the downloaded file through VirusTotal, it turned out to be a variant of the Banking Trojan Anubis detected\nby multiple antivirus signatures, as shown in Figure 1.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 1VirusTotal Detections of the App_\n\nFor further analysis, Cyble’s SaaS threat intelligence platform Cyble Vision was used to fetch more information on the\n[application using the digest from the VirusTotal result.](https://pastebin.com/raw/syZnsZkc)\n\n_Figure 2Information available in the Cyble Threat Intelligence Platform_\n\n**Technical Analysis:**\n\nDigest used for our analysis: 34bec3b2747ed7531993c73f04968c56e79f05f3b26b91cad256c9bbd5cf1beb\n\n**Package Name: wocwvy.czyxoxmbauu.slsa**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Main Activity: wocwvy.czyxoxmbauu.slsa.ncec.myvbo**\n\nUpon performing static analysis on the above app, the malware was found to be more like the Cerberus Banking Trojan\nmalware, which also steals victim data to access their bank accounts. The permissions used by this malware are listed\nbelow in the Fig. 3\n\n_Figure 3Permissions requested by the app_\n\nAfter opening the application, it requests users to enable the accessibility service from the settings to enable full access\nto the app. After that, it lures victims into changing the Accessibility settings on their phones, forbidding them to uninstall\nthe app. Also, through this service, the app executes screen taps and other commands without the user’s knowledge.\n\n_Figure 4 Accessibility service needs to be enabled for the app_\n\n\n-----\n\nSome of the suspicious permissions, receivers, and services used in the application that may\nperform malicious activities are listed below:\n\n**Permissions**\n\nandroid.permission.SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW\nandroid.permission.GET_TASKS\nandroid.permission.RECEIVE_SMS\nandroid.permission.INTERNET\nandroid.permission.READ_SMS\nandroid.permission.PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS\n\n**Services:**\n\nwocwvy.czyxoxmbauu.slsa.lmimy\nwocwvy.czyxoxmbauu.slsa.wfveenegvz\nwocwvy.czyxoxmbauu.slsa.frvvkgp\nwocwvy.czyxoxmbauu.slsa.ukhakhcgifofl\nwocwvy.czyxoxmbauu.slsa.jtfxlnc\nwocwvy.czyxoxmbauu.slsa.blkzyyyfc\nwocwvy.czyxoxmbauu.slsa.whemsbk\nwocwvy.czyxoxmbauu.slsa.nepgaqmyfrhw\nwocwvy.czyxoxmbauu.slsa.clgqtzqdh\nwocwvy.czyxoxmbauu.slsa.usbvhkriufnc\nwocwvy.czyxoxmbauu.slsa.egxltnv\nwocwvy.czyxoxmbauu.slsa.kldqwysgkfcrmq\nwocwvy.czyxoxmbauu.slsa.oyqwzkyy.qvhy.jkeggfql\nwocwvy.czyxoxmbauu.slsa.oyqwzkyy.qvhy.nvsdtnxkzjgw\nwocwvy.czyxoxmbauu.slsa.oyqwzkyy.hzgktdtr.brtltydqhiuqbb\nwocwvy.czyxoxmbauu.slsa.xelytgswelv\nwocwvy.czyxoxmbauu.slsa.mvqkjokaxfrpf\nwocwvy.czyxoxmbauu.slsa.wahiuolww\nwocwvy.czyxoxmbauu.slsa.oyqwzkyy.hzgktdtr.cpysnikhf\nwocwvy.czyxoxmbauu.slsa.oyqwzkyy.dxivifswvkcvwz.wifu\nwocwvy.czyxoxmbauu.slsa.oyqwzkyy.dxivifswvkcvwz.dshd\nwocwvy.czyxoxmbauu.slsa.kuv.sfswwunyakpjr\nwocwvy.czyxoxmbauu.slsa.ttiegryczsx\nwocwvy.czyxoxmbauu.slsa.blyvffs\n\n**Receivers:**\n\nwocwvy.czyxoxmbauu.slsa.pworotsvjdlioho.cmtstflxlxb\nwocwvy.czyxoxmbauu.slsa.pworotsvjdlioho.qpgopfninoaazln\nwocwvy.czyxoxmbauu.slsa.pworotsvjdlioho.hypihteeavv\nwocwvy.czyxoxmbauu.slsa.pworotsvjdlioho.hwfe\n\n**Intent Filters by Action:**\n\nandroid.intent.action.RESPOND_VIA_MESSAGE\nandroid.accessibilityservice.AccessibilityService\nandroid.intent.action.MAIN\nandroid.intent.action.SEND\nandroid.intent.action.SENDTO\nandroid.provider.Telephony.WAP_PUSH_DELIVER\nandroid.provider.Telephony.SMS_DELIVER\nandroid.intent.action.PACKAGE_ADDED\nandroid intent action PACKAGE REMOVED\n\n\n-----\n\nandroid.provider.Telephony.SMS_RECEIVED\nandroid.net.conn.CONNECTIVITY_CHANGE\nandroid.net.wifi.WIFI_STATE_CHANGED\n\nUsing the above permissions granted by users, the following activities are performed in the users’ devices:\n\n1.

Source of the file (Secure/Not secure) is a good indicator of whether the app is genuine or fake. For\n\ninstance, before downloading an application from an unkown source such as a web URL, it is important to check if\nthe source is secure.\n\n1. Size of the app. For example, the size of a fake app is less when compared with an authentic one.\n\n1. Spelling errors or Icon mismatches can also help distinguish fake apps from genuine ones.\n\n\n-----\n\nBy these parameters, the APK downloaded from the provided URL was identified as a fake app. In addition, the size of\nthe downloaded app is around 500 KB, while commonly, any antivirus APK size would be around a few MBs. Also, the\nsource of the file in this case is an unsecure site, which would not have been the case for an authentic app that is\npublished either in their website that redirects to an authentic app store.\n\n**Safety Recommendations:**\n\n1. Keep your antivirus software updated to detect and prevent malware infections.\n\n1. Keep your system and applications updated.\n\n1. Use strong passwords and enable two-factor authentication during logins.\n\n1. Verify the privileges and permissions requested by the app before granting access.\n\n1.
