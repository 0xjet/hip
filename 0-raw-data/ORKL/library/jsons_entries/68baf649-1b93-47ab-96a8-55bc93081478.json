Notably,\ninstallation of a root certificate and an attempt to blend malicious traffic with legitimate traffic.\n\nA full analysis of the event follows.\n\n## Discovery\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1: Deep Instinct console showing the prevented event\nWhile investigating the logs from the machine that triggered the alert for the malicious file, it was observed that the file was created\nby the Exchange Server:\n\nFigure 2: Log entry showing\n\nw3wp.exe process responsible for creating a file\nAfter inspecting additional events from the same machine, a total of seven exploitation attempts were discovered, followed by an\nattempt to drop a malicious file:\n\n**Date** **Path** **Hash**\n\n\n2021-1030T13:21:50\n\n2021-1205T14:44:13\n\n2021-1205T14:44:34\n\n2021-1218T12:06:07\n\n2022-0101T11:51:48\n\n2022-0212T08:47:36\n\n2022-0212T08:47:47\n\n\nC:\\Windows\\Temp\\user.exe 7b5fbbd90eab5bee6f3c25aa3c2762104e219f96501ad6a4463e25e6001eb00b\n\nC:\\Windows\\Temp\\task_update.exe 12c6da07da24edba13650cd324b2ad04d0a0526bb4e853dee03c094075ff6d1a\n\nC:\\Windows\\Temp\\user.exe 7b5fbbd90eab5bee6f3c25aa3c2762104e219f96501ad6a4463e25e6001eb00b\n\nC:\\Windows\\Temp\\task_update.exe 12c6da07da24edba13650cd324b2ad04d0a0526bb4e853dee03c094075ff6d1a\n\nC:\\Windows\\Temp\\user.exe b8a472f219658a28556bab4d6d109fdf3433b5233a765084c70214c973becbbd\n\nC:\\Windows\\Temp\\user.exe b8a472f219658a28556bab4d6d109fdf3433b5233a765084c70214c973becbbd\n\nC:\\Windows\\Temp\\task_update.exe 5a383edfc3c71d55773df40c71473bd949eddc6828ed7e78977b87e1854ea90a\n\n\n-----\n\nExcept for b8a472f219658a28556bab4d6d109fdf3433b5233a765084c70214c973becbbd all of the hashes have been publicly\n[reported and attributed to an Iranian threat actor Microsoft refers to as PHOSPHORUS. While most of the hashes which surfaced](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/11/16/evolving-trends-in-iranian-threat-actor-activity-mstic-presentation-at-cyberwarcon-2021/)\n[in our telemetry are identical to the ones published in an article from “The DFIR Report,” we have found additional hashes that](https://thedfirreport.com/2022/03/21/apt35-automates-initial-access-using-proxyshell/)\noverlap with other aliases of the same threat actor, so to avoid any further confusion we will refer to the threat actor simply as\nPHOSPHORUS.\n\n## user.exe\n\nThe previously unknown sample that was found in our telemetry\nb8a472f219658a28556bab4d6d109fdf3433b5233a765084c70214c973becbbd is another variant of the malware that has been\ndescribed by “The DFIR Report.”\n\nIts sole purpose is to create a new user account on the compromised system with the credentials DefaultAccount P@ssw0rd1234.\n\nIt is then added to the local administrator’s group, allowed RDP access to this account, and the password is set to never expire.\n\nThis action allows the attacker to connect to the compromised system at a later time.\n\nWhile searching in VirusTotal for files with similar behavior, we were able to identify another previously unknown variant of this file\nwith the hash 104a5ef1b1f52fe3633ce88190a1a2b2df79437cabe31b21c540cecf43c94951:\n\nFigure 3: Output from execution of “user.exe”\n\n## task_update.exe\n\n[We observed two variants of this file in our telemetry, which is responsible for downloading FRPC from an attacker-controlled](https://github.com/fatedier/frp)\nserver, followed by a creation of a scheduled task to run the downloaded FRPC.\n\nFRPC stands for Fast Reverse Proxy Client; the downloaded FRPC is configured to connect to yet another attacker-controlled\nserver, creating a tunnel between the attacker and the compromised system.\n\nThe attacker executes “user.exe” before “task_update.exe,” the created tunnel. This allows the attacker to log in to the\ncompromised system via RDP, even if the RDP is not exposed directly to the internet.\n\nBased on the above behavior, we were able to find a new variant of task_update.exe with the hash\n3e36b7a7fc8f742489ddcbe90195774b1ebf62eecc99c77152bf3a85bcb48d74.\n\nThis new variant of “task_update” adds a new root certificate to the system by issuing the command “certutil -addstore -f root\n%wintmp%\\cert.cer.”\n\n\n-----\n\nThe behavior of installing a root certificate using certutil is not present in previous iterations of task_update and it can be fairly\neasy to identify for defenders.\n\nThe hash of this root certificate file is b06c9d01cd4b89baa595f48736e6e31f2559381f1487f16304dde98ebd5e9d90 and it is\nimpersonating Microsoft:\n\nFigure 4: Details of the certificate added by the threat actor\n\nThis variant has been observed downloading FRPC from a previously undocumented attacker-controlled server 172.245.26[.]118.\n\n## FRPC Evolution\n\nThe hash of the new FRPC variant that was observed downloaded by the new task_update.exe is\na03e832aa245e3f549542f61e0e351c2cb4886feb77c02bf09bc8781944741f5.\n\nThis file has an invalid certificate chain:\n\nFigure 5:\n\nCertificate chain before installation of the root certificate\nAs mentioned earlier, the new variant of “task_update.exe” added a new root certificate. On a system with this installed certificate,\nthe certificate chain of the FRPC is slightly different but not valid:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6:\n\nCertificate chain after the installation of the root certificate\nWe can see the root certificate has been changed, yet the intermediate certificate is still invalid.\n\nWhile observing the traffic created by this variant, Deep Instinct researchers identified a previously undocumented evasion\ntechnique used by the threat actor.\n\n## Hiding Malicious Domains in Plain Sight\n\nThe binary generates many connections to domains and subdomains of legitimate companies along with connection to visually\nsimilar subdomains that are attacker controlled.\n\nThis specific variant connects to the following domains:\n\n**Legitimate domain** **Attacker-controlled domain**\n\nkcp53.bing.com kcp53.msupdate.us\n\nkcp53.symantec.com kcp53.tcp443.org\n\nsophos.com tcp443.msupdate.us\n\ntcp443.bing.com tcp443.tcp443.org\n\ntcp443.kaspersky.com\n\ntcp443.symantec.com\n\ntcp443.virustotal.com\n\nThis surge of network activity is used to confuse analysts by blending the malicious domains with similar-looking legitimate\ndomains, which may lead the analyst to classify all the above as legitimate traffic.\n\nWhile analyzing a plethora of previously undocumented FRPC variants used by the threat actor we have concluded that this\nchange was made in early 2022. Prior to this change, FRPC variants only had one attacker-controlled domain configured.\n\nSome of the new FRPC variants contained additional malicious and legitimate subdomains which are listed in the appendix.\n\n[In addition to the windows FRPC variants, ELF variants were identified that were also used with log4j exploitation.](https://www.deepinstinct.com/blog/log4shell-cve-2021-44228-what-you-need-to-know)\n\n\n-----\n\n## Additional Payload – Conser.exe\n\n6a62aa730bac97951c313880e4c6229c17fc4c393d97230f63c8be4bb7f84164\n\nThis is the hash for a .NET executable file that downloads and executes two additional files:\n\nFigure 7: Code snippet responsible for downloading the two payloads from the attacker’s server\nThe downloaded files were hosted on attacker-controlled sub-domain google.onedriver-srv[.]ml.\n\n[The domain onedriver-srv[.]ml is related to COBALT MIRAGE, this cluster of activity overlaps with PHOSPHORUS.](https://www.secureworks.com/blog/cobalt-mirage-conducts-ransomware-operations-in-us)\n\nDuring our analysis, we were not able to retrieve the “ad” file, however we were able to retrieve the “pl” file; it is a Plink executable\nwith the hash c51fe5073bd493c7e8d83365aace3f9911437a0f2ae80042ba01ea46b55d262, which was previously mentioned in a\nCISA alert AA21-321A describing Iranian APT activity. The file is used to create a SSH tunnel to the attacker’s machine while\nexposing RDP port, and was also hosted on another attacker-controlled server, activate-time-microsoft[.]cf.\n\nThe first unknown executable (“ad” file), referred to in the code as “AudioManagement,” is installed as service named “Windows\nBackup Management.”\n\nFigure 8: Code snippet responsible for creating SSH tunnel and adding the “AudioManagement” payload as a system service\n\n## Connecting the dots\n\n\n-----\n\n[While Microsoft tracked ransomware activity by PHOSPHORUS as early as May 2021, further research reveals PHOSPHORUS](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/11/16/evolving-trends-in-iranian-threat-actor-activity-mstic-presentation-at-cyberwarcon-2021/)\nactivity can be tracked at least as early as June 2020.\n\nThe FRPC sample with the hash 8aa3530540ba023fb29550643beb00c9c29f81780056e02c5a0d02a1797b9cd9 from 2021 only\nconnects to the subdomain tcp443.newdesk[.]top which resolved in the past to the IP 148.251.71[.]182.\n\nThe IP 148.251.71[.]182 was also used to resolve to the domain tcp443.symantecserver[.]co.\n\n[This domain is mentioned in another article by “The DFIR Report” regarding Exchange exploitation, both the IP and the domain](https://thedfirreport.com/2021/11/15/exchange-exploit-leads-to-domain-wide-ransomware/)\nare related to Plink, however, the hash of the file was not published.\n\nThe same article mentioned the usage of FRPC with a standalone config file, the hash of the file is\ne3eac25c3beb77ffed609c53b447a81ec8a0e20fb94a6442a51d72ca9e6f7cd2.\n\n[This same hash also appeared in another article regarding Exchange exploitation.](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_in/research/21/k/analyzing-proxyshell-related-incidents-via-trend-micro-managed-x.html)\n\nThe hash is related to incident #3 in the article, in this same incident, another hash was observed\n27cb14b58f35a4e3e13903d3237c28bb386d5a56fea88cda16ce01cbf0e5ad8e.\n\nThis file is another version of PowerLess which was also linked to PHOSPHORUS.\n\nFigure 9:

hash\nc36556977959f682e564b63ee8f0f33f70ab365bc85c043034242d2f6dbac219.\n\nThis zip contains a uniquely modified FRPC with the hash\nadb2b4ee5c7002bc64ecb1a87f0e7d728eddfda1dd550021c458f1aedcbc31f9.\n\nThis FRPC also requires a configuration file with the hash\n29486c9dc095874e8e04ac4b8c33a14ae7ad0a9e395f36b3fb71bce4e1f76758, which is also included in the .zip file.\n\nFigure 10: FRPC configuration used by the attacker\n\nFurthermore, the configuration file contains the attacker-controlled domain newdesk[.]top as well as the IP 94.182.164[.]92 which\nis [located in Iran.](https://apps.db.ripe.net/db-web-ui/query?searchtext=94.182.164.92)\n\n[The domain newdesk[.]top used to resolve in 2020 to the IP 89.32.248[.]47 is also located in Iran.](https://apps.db.ripe.net/db-web-ui/query?searchtext=89.32.248.47)\n\nThis same Iranian IP was also resolved to yet another PHOSPHORUS subdomain update.symantecserver[.]co in 2021.\n\n[In 2022, the subdomain update.symantecserver[.]co started resolving to another IP address located in Iran - 79.175.165[.]150.](https://apps.db.ripe.net/db-web-ui/query?searchtext=79.175.165.150)\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 11: Maltego Graph Illustrating Connections\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this article we described threat actor activity related to PHOSPHORUS, an Iranian APT actor active from at least 2020.\n\nThe threat actor is known to exploit Fortinet CVE-2018-13379, Exchange ProxyShell, and the log4j vulnerabilities.\n\nOur analysis indicated that PHOSPHORUS continues in its automated scanning and exploitation process in order to widely gain\naccess to multiple vulnerable organizations.\n\nFurthermore, we found that the actor is continuously changing its payload and infrastructure and discovered a new evasion\ntechnique used by PHOSPHORUS to conceal their malicious traffic and mislead security teams.\n\nThanks to Deep Instinct’s prevention capabilities the threat actor was unsuccessful in executing the payloads in a customer\nenvironment despite successful exploitation of the Exchange server.\n\n[If you’d like to see the platform in action for yourself, we’d be honored to show you what true prevention looks like.](https://info.deepinstinct.com/request-a-demo)\n\n## IOC\n\n**SHA26** **Description**\n\nb8a472f219658a28556bab4d6d109fdf3433b5233a765084c70214c973becbbd
