Microsoft previously used ‘Solorigate’_\n_as the primary designation for the actor, but moving forward, we want to place appropriate_\n_focus on the actors behind the sophisticated attacks, rather than one of the examples of_\n_malware used by the actors. Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) has named the_\n_actor behind the attack against SolarWinds, the SUNBURST backdoor, TEARDROP_\n_malware, and related components as NOBELIUM. As we release new content and analysis,_\n_we will use NOBELIUM to refer to the actor and the campaign of attacks and we have_\n_updated references appropriate in this document below._\n\nAlongside our industry partners and the security community, Microsoft continues to\ninvestigate the extent of the recent nation-state attack on SolarWinds. Our goal is to\nprovide the latest threat intelligence, Indicators of Compromise (IOC)s, and guidance across\nour products and solutions to help the community respond, harden infrastructure, and begin\nto recover from this unprecedented attack. As new information becomes available, we will\n[make updates to this article at https://aka.ms/nobelium.](https://aka.ms/solorigate)\n\n## Executive Summary and Background Information\n\nMicrosoft is aware of a sophisticated supply chain attack that has targeted a variety of\nvictims.
