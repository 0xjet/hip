Cyber security is an arms race where both attackers\nand defenders continually update and improve their tools and ways of working. To ensure\nthat our managed services remain effective against the latest threats, NCC Group operates a\nGlobal Fusion Center with Fox-IT at its core. This multidisciplinary team converts our\nleading cyber threat intelligence into powerful detection strategies.\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\n**WastedLocker is a new ransomware locker we’ve detected being used since May 2020.**\nWe believe it has been in development for a number of months prior to this and was\nstarted in conjunction with a number of other changes we have seen originate from the\n_Evil Corp group in 2020. Evil Corp were previously associated to the Dridex malware and_\n_BitPaymer ransomware, the latter came to prominence in the first half of 2017. Recently_\nEvil Corp has changed a number of TTPs related to their operations further described in\nthis article. We believe those changes were ultimately caused by the unsealing of\nindictments against Igor Olegovich Turashev and Maksim Viktorovich Yakubets, and the\nfinancial sanctions against Evil Corp in December 2019. These legal events set in motion a\nchain of events to disconnect the association of the current Evil Corp group and these two\nspecific indicted individuals and the historic actions of Evil Corp.\n\n## 2. Attribution and Actor Background\n\nWe have tracked the activities of the Evil Corp group for many years, and even though the\ngroup has changed its composition since 2011, we have been able to keep track of the\ngroup’s activities under this name.\n\n## 2.1 Actor Tracking\n\nBusiness associations are fairly fluid in organised cybercrime groups, Partnerships and\naffiliations are formed and dissolved much more frequently than in nation state\nsponsored groups, for example. Nation state backed groups often remain operational in\n\n\n-----\n\nsimilar form over longer periods of time. For this reason, cyber threat intelligence\n_reporting can be misleading, given the difficulty of maintaining assessments of the_\ncapabilities of cybercriminal groups which are accurate and current.\n\nAs an example, the Anunak group (also known as FIN7 and Carbanak) has changed\ncomposition quite frequently. As a result, the public reporting on FIN7 and Carbanak and\ntheir various associations in various open and closed source threat feeds can distort the\ncurrent reality. The Anunak or FIN7 group has worked closely with Evil Corp, and also\n_with the group publicly referred to as TA505. Hence, TA505 activity is sometimes still_\nreported as Evil Corp activity, even though these groups have not worked together since\nthe second half of 2017.\n\nIt can also be difficult to accurately attribute responsibility for a piece of malware or a\nwave of infection because commodity malware is typically sold to interested parties for\nmass distribution, or supplied to associates who have experience in monetising access to a\nspecific type of business, such as financial institutions. Similarly, it is easy for confusion\nto arise around the many financially oriented organised crime groups which are tracked\npublicly. Access to victim organisations is traded as a commodity between criminal\n_actors and so business links often exist which are not necessarily related to the day to day_\noperations of a group.\n\n## 2.2 Evil Corp\n\nNevertheless, despite these difficulties, we feel that we can assert the following with high\nconfidence, due to our in depth tracking of this group as it posed a significant threat to\nour clients. Evil Corp has been operating the Dridex malware since July 2014 and\nprovided access to several groups and individual threat actors. However, towards the end\nof 2017 Evil Corp became smaller and used Dridex infections almost exclusively for\ntargeted ransomware campaigns by deploying BitPaymer. The majority of victims were\nin North America (mainly USA) with a smaller number in Western Europe and instances\noutside of these regions being just scattered, individual cases. During 2018, Evil Corp had\na short lived partnership with TheTrick group; specifically, leasing out access to\nBitPaymer for a while, prior to their use of Ryuk.\n\nIn 2019 a fork of BitPaymer usually referred to as DoppelPaymer appeared, although this\nwas ransomware as a service and thus was not the same business model. We have\nobserved some cooperation between the two groups, but as yet can draw no definitive\nconclusions as to the current relationship between these two threat actor groups.\n\nAfter the unsealing of indictments by the US Department of Justice and actions against\nEvil Corp as group by the US Treasury Department, we detected a short period of\ninactivity from Evil Corp until January 2020. However, since January 2020 activity has\nresumed as usual, with victims appearing in the same regions as before. It is possible,\n\n\n-----\n\nhowever, that this was primarily a strategic move to suggest to the public that Evil Corp\nwas still active as, from around the middle of March 2020, we failed to observe much\nactivity from them in terms of BitPaymer deployments. Of course, this period coincided\nwith the lockdowns due to the COVID19 pandemic.\n\nThe development of new malware takes time and it is probable that they had already\nstarted the development of new techniques and malware. Early indications that this work\nwas underway included the use of a variant of Gozi we refer to as Gozi ISFB 2 variant. It is\nthought that this variant is intended as a replacement for Dridex botnet 501 as one of the\npersistent components on a target network. Similarly, a customized version of the\nCobaltStrike loader has been observed, possibly intended as a replacement for the Empire\nPowerShell framework previously used.\n\nThe group has access to highly skilled exploit and software developers capable of\nbypassing network defences on all different levels. The group seems to put a lot of effort\ninto bypassing endpoint protection products; this observation is based on the fact that\nwhen a certain version of their malware is detected on victim networks the group is back\nwith an undetected version and able to continue after just a short time. This shows the\nimportance of victims fully understanding each incident that happens. That is, detection\nor blocking of a single element from the more advanced criminal actors does not mean\nthey have been defeated.\n\nThe lengths Evil Corp goes through in order to bypass endpoint protection tools is\ndemonstrated by the fact that they abused a victim’s email so they could pose as a\nlegitimate potential client to a vendor and request a trial license for a popular endpoint\nprotection product that is not commonly available.\n\nIt appears the group regularly finds innovative but practical approaches to bypass\n_detection in victim networks based on their practical experience gained throughout the_\nyears. They also demonstrate patience and persistence. In one case, they successfully\ncompromised a target over 6 months after their initial failure to obtain privileged access.\nThey also display attention to detail by, for example, ensuring that they obtain the\n_passwords to disable security tools on a network prior to deploying the ransomware._\n\n### 2.3 WastedLocker\n\nThe new WastedLocker ransomware appeared in May 2020 (a technical description is\nincluded below). The ransomware name is derived from the filename it creates which\nincludes an abbreviation of the victim’s name and the string ‘wasted’. The abbreviation of\nthe victim’s name was also seen in BitPaymer, although a larger portion of the\norganisation name was used in BitPaymer and individual letters were sometimes replaced\nby similar looking numbers.\n\n\n-----\n\nTechnically, WastedLocker does not have much in common with BitPaymer, apart from\nthe fact that it appears that victim specific elements are added using a specific builder\nrather than at compile time, which is similar to BitPaymer. Some similarities were also\nnoted in the ransom note generated by the two pieces of malware. The first WastedLocker\nexample we found contained the victim name as in BitPaymer ransom notes and also\nincluded both a protonmail.com and tutanota.com email address. Later versions also\ncontained other Protonmail and Tutanota email domains, as well as Eclipso and Airmail\nemail addresses. Interestingly the user parts of the email addresses listed in the ransom\nmessages are numeric (usually 5 digit numbers) which is similar to the 6 to 12 digit\nnumbers seen used by BitPaymer in 2018.\n\nEvil Corp are selective in terms of the infrastructure they target when deploying their\nransomware. Typically, they hit file servers, database services, virtual machines and\n_cloud environments. Of course, these choices will also be heavily influenced by what we_\nmay term their ‘business model’ – which also means they should be able to disable or\ndisrupt backup applications and related infrastructure. This increases the time for\nrecovery for the victim, or in some cases due to unavailability of offline or offsite backups,\nprevents the ability to recover at all.\n\nIt is interesting that the group has not appeared to have engaged in extensive\n_information stealing or threatened to publish information about victims in the way that_\nthe DoppelPaymer and many other targeted ransomware operations have. We assess that\nthe probable reason for not leaking victim information is the unwanted attention this\nwould draw from law enforcement and the public.\n\n## 3. Distribution\n\nWhile many things have changed in the TTPs of Evil Corp recently, one very notable\nelement has not changed, the distribution via the SocGholish fake update framework.\nThis framework is still in use although it is now used to directly distribute a custom\n_CobaltStrike loader, described in 4.1, rather than Dridex as in the past years. One of the_\nmore notable features of this framework is the evaluation of wether a compromised victim\nsystem is part of a larger network, as a sole enduser system is of no use to the attackers.\nThe SocGholish JavaScript bot has access to information from the system itself as it runs\nunder the privileges of the browser user. The bot collects a large set of information and\nsends that to the SocGholish server side which, in turn, returns a payload to the victim\nsystem. Other methods of distribution also appear to still be in use, but we have not been\nable to independently verify this at the time of writing.\n\n## 4. Technical Analysis\n\n### 4.1 CobaltStrike payloads\n\n\n-----\n\nThe CobaltStrike payloads are embedded inside two types of PowerShell scripts. The first\ntype (which targets Windows 64-bit only) decodes a base64 payload twice and then\ndecrypts it using the AES algorithm in CBC mode. The AES key is derived by computing\nthe SHA256 hash of the hard-coded string ‘saN9s9pNlD5nJ2EyEd4rPym68griTOMT’\nand the initialisation vector (IV), is derived from the first 16 bytes of the twice base64decoded payload. The script converts the decrypted payload (a base64-encoded string) to\nbytes and allocates memory before executing it.\n\nThe second type is relatively simpler and includes two embedded base64-encoded\npayloads, an injector and a loader for the CobaltStrike payload. It appears that both the\ninjector and the loader are part of the ‘Donut’ project [3].\n\nAn interesting behaviour can be spotted in the CobaltStrike payloads that are delivered\nfrom the second type of PowerShell scripts. In these, the loader has been modified with\nthe purpose of detecting CrowdStrike software (Figure 1). If the `C:\\\\Program`\n```\nFiles\\\\CrowdStrike directory exists, then the ‘FreeConsole’ Windows API is called\n\n```\nafter loading the CobaltStrike payload. Otherwise, the ‘FreeConsole’ function is called\nbefore loading the CobaltStrike beacon. It is assumed that this is an attempt to bypass\nCrowdStrike’s endpoint solution, although it still unclear if this is the case.\n\nFigure 1: Decompilation showing CrowdStrike specific detection logic\n\n### 4.2 The Crypter\n\n_WastedLocker is protected with a custom crypter, referred to as CryptOne by Fox-IT_\nInTELL. On examination, the code turned out to be very basic and used also by other\nmalware families such as: Netwalker, Gozi ISFB v3, ZLoader and Smokeloader.\n\nThe crypter mainly contains junk code to increase entropy of the sample and hide the\nactual code. We have found 2 crypter variants with some code differences, but mostly\nwith the same logic applied.\n\nThe first action performed by the crypter code is to check some specific registry key. In\nthe variants analysed the registry key is either: interface\\{b196b287-bab4-101a**b69c-00aa00341d07} or interface\\{aa5b6a80-b834-11d0-932f-**\n\n\n-----\n\n**00a0c90dcaa9}. These keys relate to the UCOMIEnumConnections Interface and**\nthe IActiveScriptParseProcedure32 interface respectively. If the key is not detected,\nthe crypter will enter an infinite loop or exit, thus it is used as an anti-analysis technique.\n\nIn the next step the crypter allocates a memory buffer calling the VirtualAlloc API. A\nwhile loop is used to join a series of data blobs into the allocated buffer, and the contents\nof this buffer are then decrypted with an XOR based algorithm. Once decrypted, the\ncrypter jumps into the data blob which turns out to be a shellcode responsible for\ndecrypting the actual payload. The shellcode copies the encrypted payload into another\nbuffer allocated by calling the VirtualAlloc API, and then decrypts this with an XOR based\nalgorithm in a similar way to that described above. To execute the payload, the shellcode\nreplaces the crypter’s code in memory with the code of the payload just decrypted, and\njumps to its entry point.\n\nAs noted above, we have observed this crypter being used by other malware families as\nwell. Related information and IOCs can be found in the Appendix.\n\n### 4.3 WastedLocker Ransomware\n\n_WastedLocker aims to encrypt the files of the infected host. However before the_\nencryption procedure runs, WastedLocker performs a few other tasks to ensure the\nransomware will run properly.\n\nFirst, Wastedlocker decrypts the strings which are stored in the .bss section and then\ncalculates a DWORD value that is used later for locating decrypted strings that are related\nto the encryption process. This is described in more detail in the String encryption\nsection. In addition, the ransomware creates a log file lck.log and then sets an exception\nhandler that creates a crash dump file in the Windows temporary folder with the\nfilename being the ransomware’s binary filename.\n\nIf the ransomware is not executed with administrator rights or if the infected host runs\nWindows Vista or later, it will attempt to elevate its privileges. In short, WastedLocker\nuses a well-documented UAC bypass method [1] [2]. It chooses a random file (EXE/DLL)\nfrom the Windows system32 folder and copies it to the %APPDATA% location under a\ndifferent hidden filename. Next, it creates an alternate data stream (ADS) into the file\nnamed bin and copies the ransomware into it. WastedLocker then copies winsat.exe and\nwinmm.dll into a newly created folder located in the Windows temporary folder. Once\nloaded, the hijacked DLL (winmm.dll) is patched to execute the aforementioned ADS.\n\nThe ransomware supports the following command line parameters (Table 1):\n\n\n-----\n\n**Para-**\n**meter** **Purpose**\n\n-r i. Delete shadow copies\nii. Copy the ransomware binary file to %windir%\\system32 and take\n_ownership of it (takeown.exe /F filepath) and reset the ACL permissions_\niii. Create and run a service. The service is deleted once the encryption\nprocess is completed.\n\n-s Execute service’s entry\n\n\n-p\ndirectory_path\n\n-f\ndirectory_path\n\n\nEncrypt files in a specified directory and then proceed with the rest of\nthe files in the drive\n\nEncrypt files in a specified directory\n\n_Table 1 – WastedLocker command line parameters_\n\n\nIt is also worth noting that in case of any failure from the first two parameters (-r and –s),\nthe ransomware proceeds with the encryption but applies the following registry\nmodifications in the registry key Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Internet\nSettings\\ZoneMap:\n\n**Name** **Modification**\n\nProxyBypass Deletes this key\n\nIntranetName Deletes this key\n\nUNCAsIntranet Sets this key to 0\n\nAutoDetect Sets this key to 1\n\n_Table 2 – Registry keys_\n\nThe above modifications apply to both 32-bit and 64-bit systems and is possibly done to\nensure that the ransomware can access remote drives. However, a bug is included in the\narchitecture identification code. The ransomware authors use a well-known method to\nidentify the operating system architecture. The ransomware reads the memory address\n**0x7FFE0300 (KUSER_SHARED_DATA) and checks if the pointer is zero. If it is then**\nthe 32-bit process of the ransomware is running in a Windows 64-bit host (Figure 2). The\nissue is that this does not work on Windows 10 systems.\n\nFigure 2: Decompilation showing method used to identify operating system architecture\n\n\n-----\n\nAdditionally, WastedLocker chooses a random name from a generated name list in order\nto generate filename or service names. The ransomware creates this list by reading the\nregistry keys stored in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\nand then separates their names whenever a capital letter is found. For example, the\nregistry key AppReadiness will be separated to two words, App and Readiness.\n\n### 4.4 Strings Encryption\n\nThe strings pertaining to the ransomware are encrypted and stored in the .bss section of\nthe binary file. This includes the ransom note along with other important information\nnecessary for the ransomware’s tasks. The strings are decrypted using a key that\ncombined the size and raw address of the .bss section, as well as the ransomware’s\ncompilation timestamp.\n\nThe code’s authors use an interesting method to locate the encrypted strings related to the\nencryption process. To locate one of them, the ransomware calculates a checksum that is\nlooked up in the encrypted strings table. The checksum is derived from both a constant\nvalue that is unique to each string and a fixed value, which are bitwise XORed. The\nencrypted strings table consists of a struct like shown below for each string.\n```\nstruct ransomware_string\n{\nWORD total_size; // string_length + checksum + ransom_string\nWORD string_length;\nDWORD Checksum; \nBYTE[string_length] ransom_string;\n};\n\n### 4.5 Encryption Process\n\n```\nThe encryption process is quite straightforward. The ransomware targets the following\ndrive types:\n\nRemovable\nFixed\nShared\nRemote\n\nInstead of including a list of extension targets, WastedLocker includes a list of directories\nand extensions to exclude from the encryption process. Files with a size less than 10 bytes\nare also ignored and in case of a large file, the ransomware encrypts them in blocks of\n_64MB._\n\nOnce a drive is found, the ransomware starts searching for and encrypting files. Each file\nis encrypted using the AES algorithm with a newly generated AES key and IV (256-bit in\n_CBC mode) for each file. The AES key and IV are encrypted with an embedded public RSA_\n_key (4096 bits). The RSA encrypted output of key material is converted to base64 and_\nthen stored into the ransom note.\n\n\n-----\n\nFor each encrypted file, the ransomware creates an additional file that includes the\nransomware note. The encrypted file’s extension is set according to the targeted\norganisations name along with the prefix wasted (hence the name we have gave to this\nransomware). For example, test.txt.orgnamewasted (encrypted data) and\n**_test.txt.orgnamewasted_info (ransomware note). The ransomware note and the list_**\nof excluded directories and extensions is available in the Appendix. Finally, once the\nencryption of each file has been completed, the ransomware updates the log file with the\nfollowing information:\n\nNumber of targeted files\nNumber of files which were encrypted\nNumber of files which were not encrypted due to access rights issues\n\n### 4.6 WastedLocker Decrypter\n\nDuring our analysis, we managed to identify a decrypter for WastedLocker. The decrypter\nrequires administrator privileges and similarl to the encryption process, it reports the\nnumber of files which were successfully decrypted (Figure 3).\n\nFigure 3: Command line output of the decrypter of WastedLocker\n\n## References\n\n1. hxxps://medium.com/tenable-techblog/uac-bypass-by-mocking-trusted\ndirectories-24a96675f6e\n2. hxxps://github.com/hfiref0x/UACME\n3. hxxps://github.com/TheWover/donut/\n\n## Appendix\n\n_Ransom note_\n```\n*ORGANIZATION_NAME*\nYOUR NETWORK IS ENCRYPTED NOW\nUSE *EMAIL1* | *EMAIL2* TO GET THE PRICE FOR YOUR DATA\nDO NOT GIVE THIS EMAIL TO 3RD PARTIES\nDO NOT RENAME OR MOVE THE FILE\nTHE FILE IS ENCRYPTED WITH THE FOLLOWING KEY:\n[begin_key]*[end_key]\nKEEP IT\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n_Excluded extensions (in addition to orgnamewasted and orgnamewasted_info)_\n```\n*\\ntldr\n*.386\n*.adv\n*.ani\n*.bak\n*.bat\n*.bin\n*.cab\n*.cmd\n*.com\n*.cpl\n*.cur\n*.dat\n*.diagcab\n*.diagcfg\n*.dll\n*.drv\n*.exe\n*.hlp\n*.hta\n*.icl\n*.icns\n*.ics\n*.idx\n*.ini\n*.key\n*.lnk\n*.mod\n*.msc\n*.msi\n*.msp\n*.msstyles\n*.msu\n*.nls\n*.nomedia\n*.ocx\n*.ps1\n*.rom\n*.rtp\n*.scr\n*.sdi\n*.shs\n*.sys\n*.theme\n*.themepack\n*.wim\n*.wpx\n*\\bootmgr\n*\\grldr\n\n```\n_Excluded directories_\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n*\\$recycle.bin*\n*\\appdata*\n*\\bin*\n*\\boot*\n*\\caches*\n*\\dev*\n*\\etc*\n*\\initdr*\n*\\lib*\n*\\programdata*\n*\\run*\n*\\sbin*\n*\\sys*\n*\\system volume information*\n*\\users\\all users*\n*\\var*\n*\\vmlinuz*\n*\\webcache*\n*\\windowsapps*\nc:\\program files (x86)*\nc:\\program files*\nc:\\programdata*\nc:\\recovery*\nc:\\users\\ %USERNAME%\\appdata\\local\\temp*\nc:\\users\\ %USERNAME%\\appdata\\roaming*\nc:\\windows*\n\n## IoCs\n\n```\nIoCs related to targeted ransomware attacks are a generally misunderstood concept in the\ncase of targeted ransomware. Each ransomware victim has a custom build configured or\ncompiled for them and so the knowing the specific hashes used against historic victims\ndoes not provide any protection at all. Even if behavioural patterns of the ransomware or\nnetwork related indicators of the ransomware stage are given (should they exist), it is\narguable whether detection of the attack at that stage would allow prevention of the actual\nattack. We do include known ransomware hashes here; however, please note that these\nare for RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY. Blocking files based on these file attributes in any\nendpoint protection product will not provide any value.\n\nAt Fox-IT we focus mainly on detection of the initial stages of such attacks (such as the\ninitial stage of infection) by detecting the various methods of infection delivery as well as\nthe lateral movement stage which typically involves scanning, exploitation and/or\ncredential dumping. Providing these IoCs to the wider public would, however, be\ncounterproductive as the threat actors would simply change these methods or work\naround the indicators.
