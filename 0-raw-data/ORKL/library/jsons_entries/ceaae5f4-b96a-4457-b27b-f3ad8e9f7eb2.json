FBI and CISA believe this variant, which uses its own\ncustom-made file encryption program, evolved from earlier iterations that used “Zeon” as a loader. After\ngaining access to victims’ networks, Royal actors disable antivirus software and exfiltrate large amounts of\ndata before ultimately deploying the ransomware and encrypting the systems. Royal actors have made\nransom demands ranging from approximately $1 million to $11 million USD in Bitcoin. In observed incidents,\nRoyal actors do not include ransom amounts and payment instructions as part of the initial ransom note.\nInstead, the note, which appears after encryption, requires victims to directly interact with the threat actor via\n[a .onion URL (reachable through the Tor browser). Royal actors have targeted numerous critical](https://cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa20-183a)\ninfrastructure sectors including, but not limited to, Manufacturing, Communications, Healthcare and Public\nHealthcare (HPH), and Education.\n\nFBI and CISA encourage organizations to implement the recommendations in the Mitigations section of this\nCSA to reduce the likelihood and impact of ransomware incidents.\n\nDownload the PDF version of this report:\n\n[#StopRansomware: Royal Ransomware\n(PDF, 586.96 KB\n)](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/aa23-061a-stopransomware-royal-ransomware_0.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\nFor a downloadable copy of IOCs, see\n\n[AA23-061A STIX XML\n(XML, 114.26 KB\n)](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/aa23-061a.stix__0.xml)\n\n**TECHNICAL DETAILS**\n\n**_Note: This advisory uses the MITRE ATT&CK® for Enterprise framework, version 12._** _See MITRE ATT&CK_\n_for Enterprise for all referenced tactics and techniques._\n\nRoyal ransomware uses a unique partial encryption approach that allows the threat actor to choose a\nspecific percentage of data in a file to encrypt. This approach allows the actor to lower the encryption\n[percentage for larger files, which helps evade detection.[1] In addition to encrypting files, Royal actors also](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/royal-ransomware-analysis)\nengage in double extortion tactics in which they threaten to publicly release the encrypted data if the victim\ndoes not pay the ransom.\n\n**Initial Access**\n\nRoyal actors gain initial access to victim networks in a number of ways including:\n\n**Phishing. According to third-party reporting, Royal actors most commonly (in 66.7% of incidents) gain**\n[initial access to victim networks via successful phishing emails [T1566].](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/techniques/T1566/)\n\nAccording to open-source reporting, victims have unknowingly installed malware that delivers\nRoyal ransomware after receiving phishing emails containing malicious PDF\n[documents [T1566.001], and malvertising [T1566.002].[2]](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/techniques/T1566/001/)\n**Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). The second most common vector Royal actors use (in 13.3% of**\nincidents) for initial access is RDP compromise.\n**Public-facing applications. FBI has also observed Royal actors gain initial access through exploiting**\n[public-facing applications [T1190].](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/techniques/T1190/)\n**Brokers. Reports from trusted third-party sources indicate that Royal actors may leverage brokers to**\ngain initial access and source traffic by harvesting virtual private network (VPN) credentials from stealer\nlogs.\n\n**Command and Control**\n\nOnce Royal actors gain access to the network, they communicate with command and control (C2)\n[infrastructure and download multiple tools [T1105]. Legitimate Windows software is repurposed by Royal](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/techniques/T1105/)\noperators to strengthen their foothold in the victim’s network. Ransomware operators often use open-source\nprojects to aid their intrusion activities; Royal operators have recently been observed using Chisel, a\n[tunneling tool transported over HTTP and secured via SSH [T1572], to communicate with their C2](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/techniques/T1572/)\ninfrastructure. FBI has observed multiple Qakbot C2s used in Royal ransomware attacks, but has not yet\ndetermined if Royal ransomware exclusively uses Qakbot C2s.\n\n**Lateral Movement and Persistence**\n\n[Royal actors often use RDP to move laterally across the network [T1021.001]. Microsoft Sysinternals tool](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/techniques/T1021/001/)\n```\nPsExec has also been used to aid lateral movement. FBI has observed Royal actors using remote monitoring\n\n```\nand management (RMM) software, such as AnyDesk, LogMeIn, and Atera, for persistence in the victim’s\n[network [T1133]. In some instances, the actors moved laterally to the domain controller. In one confirmed](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/techniques/T1133/)\n[case, the actors used a legitimate admin account to remotely log on to the domain controller [T1078]. Once](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/techniques/T1078)\n[on the domain controller, the threat actor deactivated antivirus protocols [T1562.001] by modifying Group](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/techniques/T1562/001/)\n[Policy Objects [T1484.001].](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/techniques/T1484/001/)\n\n**Exfiltration**\n\n\n-----\n\nRoyal actors exfiltrate data from victim networks by repurposing legitimate cyber pentesting tools, such as\nCobalt Strike, and malware tools and derivatives, such as Ursnif/Gozi, for data aggregation and exfiltration.\nAccording to third-party reporting, Royal actors’ first hop in exfiltration and other operations is usually a U.S.\nIP address.\n\n_Note: In reference to Cobalt Strike and other tools mentioned above, a tool repository used by Royal was_\n_identified at IP: 94.232.41[.]105 in December 2022._\n\n**Encryption**\n\nBefore starting the encryption process, Royal actors:\n\nUse Windows Restart Manager to determine whether targeted files are currently in use or blocked by\n[other applications [T1486].[1]](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/techniques/T1486/)\nUse Windows Volume Shadow Copy service (vssadmin.exe) to delete shadow copies to prevent\n[system recovery.[1]](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/royal-ransomware-analysis)\n\nFBI has found numerous batch (.bat) files on impacted systems which are typically transferred as an\n[encrypted 7zip file. Batch files create a new admin user [T1078.002], force a group policy update, set](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/techniques/T1078/002/)\n[pertinent registry keys to auto-extract [T1119] and execute the ransomware, monitor the encryption process,](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/techniques/T1119/)\n[and delete files upon completion—including Application, System, and Security event logs [T1070.001].](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/techniques/T1070/001/)\n\nMalicious files have been found in victim networks in the following directories:\n```\n   C:\\Temp\\ \n   C:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Roaming\\ \n   C:\\Users\\<users>\\\n   C:\\ProgramData\\\n\n```\n**Indicators of Compromise (IOC)**\n\nSee table 1 and 2 for Royal ransomware IOCs that FBI obtained during threat response activities as of\nJanuary 2023. Note: Some of the observed IP addresses are several months old. FBI and CISA recommend\nvetting or investigating these IP addresses prior to taking forward-looking action, such as blocking.\n\n_Table 1: Royal Ransomware Associated Files, Hashes, and IP addresses

to reduce the risk of compromise by Royal\n[ransomware. These mitigations follow CISA’s Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs), which provide a](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/2022_00092_CISA_CPG_Report_508c.pdf)\nminimum set of practices and protections that are informed by the most common and impactful threats,\ntactics, techniques, and procedures, and which yield goals that all organizations across critical infrastructure\nsectors should implement:\n\n\n-----\n\n**Implement a recovery plan to maintain and retain multiple copies of sensitive or proprietary data and**\n[servers [CPG 7.3] in a physically separate, segmented, and secure location (i.e., hard drive, storage](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/2022_00092_CISA_CPG_Report_508c.pdf)\ndevice, the cloud).\n**Require all accounts with password logins (e.g., service account, admin accounts, and domain admin**\naccounts) to comply with [National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) standards for](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/)\n[developing and managing password policies [CPG 3.4].](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/2022_00092_CISA_CPG_Report_508c.pdf)\n\nUse longer passwords consisting of at least 8 characters and no more than 64 characters in\n[length [CPG 1.4].](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/2022_00092_CISA_CPG_Report_508c.pdf)\nStore passwords in hashed format using industry-recognized password managers.\nAdd password user “salts” to shared login credentials.\nAvoid reusing passwords.\n[Implement multiple failed login attempt account lockouts [CPG 1.1].](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/2022_00092_CISA_CPG_Report_508c.pdf)\nDisable password hints.\nRefrain from requiring password changes more frequently than once per year. Note: NIST\nguidance suggests favoring longer passwords instead of requiring regular and frequent password\nresets. Frequent password resets are more likely to result in users developing password patterns\ncyber criminals can easily decipher.\nRequire administrator credentials to install software.\n**[Require multifactor authentication [CPG 1.3] for all services to the extent possible, particularly for](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/2022_00092_CISA_CPG_Report_508c.pdf)**\nwebmail, virtual private networks, and accounts that access critical systems.\n**Keep all operating systems, software, and firmware up to date. Timely patching is one of the most**\nefficient and cost-effective steps an organization can take to minimize its exposure to cybersecurity\nthreats.\n**[Segment networks [CPG 8.1]. Network segmentation can help prevent the spread of ransomware by](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/2022_00092_CISA_CPG_Report_508c.pdf)**\ncontrolling traffic flows between—and access to—various subnetworks and by restricting adversary\nlateral movement.\n**Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the indicated**\n**ransomware with a networking monitoring tool. To aid in detecting ransomware, implement a tool**\n[that logs and reports all network traffic [CPG 5.1], including lateral movement activity on a network.](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/2022_00092_CISA_CPG_Report_508c.pdf)\nEndpoint detection and response (EDR) tools are useful for detecting lateral connections as they have\ninsight into common and uncommon network connections for each host.\n**Install, regularly update, and enable real time detection for antivirus software on all hosts.**\n**Review domain controllers, servers, workstations, and active directories for new and/or**\nunrecognized accounts.\n**Audit user accounts with administrative privileges and configure access controls according to the**\n[principle of least privilege [CPG 1.5].](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/2022_00092_CISA_CPG_Report_508c.pdf)\n**Disable unused ports.**\n**[Consider adding an email banner to emails [CPG 8.3] received from outside your organization.](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/2022_00092_CISA_CPG_Report_508c.pdf)**\n**Implement time-based access for accounts set at the admin level and higher. For example, the**\nJust-in-Time (JIT) access method provisions privileged access when needed and can support\nenforcement of the principle of least privilege (as well as the Zero Trust model). This is a process\nwhere a network-wide policy is set in place to automatically disable admin accounts at the Active\nDirectory level when the account is not in direct need. Individual users may submit their requests\nthrough an automated process that grants them access to a specified system for a set timeframe when\nthey need to support the completion of a certain task.\n**Disable command-line and scripting activities and permissions.

Furthermore, payment may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations,\nencourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities.\nRegardless of whether you or your organization have decided to pay the ransom, FBI and CISA urge you to\n[promptly report ransomware incidents to a local FBI Field Office, or CISA at](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices) [https://www.cisa.gov/report.](https://www.cisa.gov/report)\n\n**DISCLAIMER**\n\nThe information in this report is being provided “as is” for informational purposes only.
