Geographic targeting includes North America, Europe, and Southeast Asia.\nTA2722 distributes Remcos and NanoCore remote access trojans (RATs).\n\n## Overview\n\nProofpoint identified a new and highly active cybercriminal threat actor, TA2722, colloquially referred to by Proofpoint threat researchers\nas the Balikbayan Foxes. Throughout 2021, a series of campaigns impersonated multiple Philippine government entities including the\nDepartment of Health, the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA), and the Bureau of Customs. Other related\ncampaigns masqueraded as the Manila embassy for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) and DHL Philippines. The messages were\nintended for a variety of industries in North America, Europe, and Southeast Asia, with the top sectors including Shipping, Logistics,\nManufacturing, Business Services, Pharmaceutical, Energy, and Finance.\n\nProofpoint assesses this actor is targeting organizations directly or indirectly engaged with the Philippine government based on a\ncontinuous pattern of spoofing email addresses and delivering lures designed to impersonate government entities. For example, the\nshipping, transportation, and logistics companies would frequently engage with customs officials at ports of call. Additionally, the\nmanufacturing and energy companies support and maintain large supply chain operations, likely requiring correspondence with both\nlabor and customs organizations.\n\nAll the campaigns distributed either Remcos or NanoCore remote access trojans (RATs). Remcos and NanoCore are typically used for\ninformation gathering, data theft operations, monitoring and control of compromised computers. While the malware’s associated\ninfrastructure changed over time, the sender emails were reused for a long period of time.\n\n[In 2020, Philippine government entities issued multiple](https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1106814) [alerts warning users of the activity related to lures using themes such as COVID-](https://www.facebook.com/poea.gov.ph/photos/a.1107908212635101/3058798210879415/?type=3&eid=ARCpTFz5-C3KmQZ8DMVUnTnjAkPOm_VCzTfBt9uHyAKa3_C22vS4RQYTsD78jkLIG28G_MVS8VDFNtJc)\n19 infection information in the Philippines and the POEA labor information.\n\n## Campaign Details\n\nProofpoint researchers identified a series of campaigns distributing Remcos and NanoCore RATs masquerading as the Kingdom of\nSaudi Arabia (KSA) embassy in Manila and the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA) in mid-2021. Upon further\ninvestigation, Proofpoint identified additional, separate campaigns distributing the same malware masquerading as the Philippine\nDepartment of Health and Bureau of Customs.\n\nProofpoint separated campaigns into two distinct threat activity clusters. In all cases, message lures were in English. They contained\nmultiple threat distribution mechanisms including:\n\nOneDrive URLs linking to RAR files with embedded UUE files\nPDF email attachment with an embedded OneDrive link or other malicious URL leading to compressed executables (.iso files) that\ndownload and run malware\nCompressed MS Excel documents containing macros which, if enabled, download malware\n\nRemcos is a commodity remote access tool available for purchase online. NanoCore is also commodity malware and written in .NET by\n\"Aeonhack\". The code is obfuscated with Eazfuscator.NET 3.3. NanoCore RAT is sold on various hack forums. NanoCore includes\nmany features and plugins. Both Remcos and NanoCore RAT are distributed by numerous cybercrime threat actors with many different\ndelivery techniques and lures.\n\n**Threat Cluster Shahzad73**\n\nProofpoint named the first identified cluster Shahzad73 based on the command and control (C2) domains used by the threat actor:\n\nshahzad73[.]ddns[.]net\n\nshahzad73[.]casacam[.]net\n\nAlthough Proofpoint began regularly tracking this activity cluster in April 2021, historic data suggests the activity dates as far back as\nAugust 2020. The threat actor generally leverages themes purporting to be labor-related messages, including spoofing the Philippine\nOverseas Employment Administration (POEA) and the Saudi Arabian consulate in Manila. Other, less frequent threats observed in\nShahzad73 campaigns were associated with billing/invoice lures. The messages impacted hundreds of customers globally including\nentities in the Transportation, Energy, Construction, Manufacturing, Finance, and Business Services industries.\n\nMessages purported to be, for example:\n\n\n-----\n\nFrom: POEA info1@poea.gov.ph\n\nSubject: \"POEA ADVISORY ON DELISTED AGENCIES.\"\n\n_Figure 1: Email sample purporting to be from Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA)._\n\nAdditional samples include:\n\nFrom: \"ksa.Consulate manila \" <consulate_ksa_emb@gmail.com>\n\nSubject: \"Memorandum from the Saudi Embassy\"\n\n_Figure 2: Email sample purporting to be from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) consulate._\n\n[Saudi Arabia is reportedly one of the most popular destinations for the country’s overseas workers, with over one million Filipinos](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/philippines-halts-deployment-workers-saudi-arabia-2021-05-28/)\n[working there. In May 2021, the Philippines temporarily suspended sending workers to the Kingdom after receiving reports Filipino](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/philippines-lifts-ban-workers-deploying-saudi-arabia-2021-05-29/)\nworkers were being charged for COVID-19 testing and quarantine. Proofpoint identified a campaign spoofing the KSA embassy in\nManila targeting transportation entities, among others, around the same time.\n\n\n-----\n\nMost of these messages contain either UUE or RAR attachments ultimately leading to the installation of Remcos remote access trojan\n(RAT) or NanoCore RAT. Each campaign featured a dynamic DNS C2 domain containing the keyword shahzad73.\n\nExample attachment file names:\n\nmemorandum from the saudi embassy.pdf.uue.rar\n\nMemorandum from the Saudi Embassy.pdf.uue\n\nPOEA Memo-Circular No 019-22.pdf.uue\n\nPOEA Memo-Circular No 002-06.pdf.exe\n\npoea memo on delisted agencies ! reminder.uue.rar\n\npoea advisory on delisted agencies.pdf.uue\n\nswiftusd33,980_soa005673452425.uue.rar\n\nThe observed Remcos samples included the following example configuration:\n\nC2: shahzad73[.]casacam[.]net:2404\n\nC2: shahzad73[.]ddns[.]net:2404\n\nlicense: 9C98D5D48F9EA32282C07700F23815A0\n\nversion: 2.7.2 Pro\n\nObserved NanoCore RAT samples included the following example configuration:\n\nGCThreshold: 10485760\n\nKeyboardLogging: True\n\nWanTimeout: 8000\n\nVersion: 1.2.2.0\n\nMutex: Global\\{a58bb08a-85df-4191-824c-1b90cbce1024}\n\nRestartDelay: 5000\n\nBackupDnsServer: 8.8.4.4\n\nPrimaryDnsServer: 8.8.8.8\n\nConnectionPort: 9036\n\nMaxPacketSize: 10485760\n\nBufferSize: 65535\n\nClearZoneIdentifier: True\n\nDefaultGroup: ENDING-JUNE\n\nLanTimeout: 2500\n\nBackupConnectionHost: shahzad73[.]ddns[.]net\n\nBuildTime: 2021-07-26 13:34:18 UTC\n\nUseCustomDnsServer: True\n\nMutexTimeout: 5000\n\nKeepAliveTimeout: 30000\n\nPrimaryConnectionHost: shahzad73[.]casacam[.]net\n\n\n-----\n\nTimeoutInterval: 5000\n\nPreventSystemSleep: True\n\nConnectDelay: 4000\n\n**Threat Cluster CPRS**\n\nProofpoint named the second identified threat cluster CPRS based on the actor regularly spoofing the Philippines Bureau of Customs Client Profile Registration System (CPRS) in ongoing campaigns. The identified Remcos RAT campaigns impacted nearly 150\ncustomers globally, with a focus on Shipping and Logistics, Manufacturing, Industry, and Energy sectors.\n\nProofpoint began tracking this activity cluster in December 2019. The actor appeared to conduct multiple campaigns per month through\nOctober 2020. Activity restarted again in September 2021. Historic data suggests the activity dates as far back as 2018. The threat actor\ngenerally leverages themes purporting to be entities related to the Philippine government, most frequently the Bureau of Customs\nCPRS. Other emails masqueraded as the country’s Department of Health distributing COVID-19 information. Other, less frequently\nobserved threats in related campaigns were associated invoice, shipping, or Finance/Treasury themes.\n\nMessages purported to be, for example:\n\nFrom: cprs@customs[.]gov[.]ph\n\nSubject: \"E-Mail Alert for Status: PROVISIONAL GOODS DECLARATION REFERENCE NO.C-1075027-21\"\n\n_Figure 3: Email purporting to be a Bureau of Customs declaration._\n\nOther message samples include:\n\nFrom: COVID-19@doh.gov.ph\n\nSubject: \"Covid-19 Data Cases Report in Your Location-The Department of Health (DOH)\"\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 4: Message purporting to be COVID-19 information from the Philippine Department of Health._\n\nExample attachment file names:\n\ncovid-19 pcr test report checklist.pdf\n\ncovid-19 data cases report.pdf\n\nnotice to submit.pdf\n\nThe emails contain either a OneDrive URL or a PDF attachment with a OneDrive URL leading to the download of a compressed\nexecutable (e.g. Covid-19 Data Report Checklist_pdf.iso) which, if executed, leads to Remcos RAT.\n\nThe most recent Remcos configuration is as follows:\n\nC2: cato[.]fingusti[.]club\n\nLicense: 4E7867F67DE525ADF9F3A74DBEB02869\n\nVersion: 2.7.2 Pro\n\nMutex: nan\n\nuse_tls: nan\n\n2020 campaigns included the following Remcos configuration:\n\nC2: remcos[.]got-game[.]org:2265:pass\n\nlicense: D77341DCD207EB897C3383385A6676C2\n\nversion: 2.5.0 Pro\n\nOn 27 September 2021, the threat actor appeared to change tactics. Proofpoint researchers observed corporate credential capture\nattempts targeting many of the same companies as previously observed Remcos activity. The phishing emails masqueraded as the\nPhilippines Bureau of Customs CPRS and contained actor-hosted URLs linking to a credential harvesting page.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5: Credential capture landing page._\n\nDespite an expansion of TTPs to include credential harvesting campaigns, Proofpoint assesses with high confidence credential capture\nactivities are likely temporary and the threat actor maintains ongoing high levels of malware distribution activity.\n\n## Threat Cluster Overlap\n\nProofpoint assesses with high confidence the two observed threat clusters are associated with the same threat actor, TA2722. Of note,\nboth clusters targeted a frequently overlapping set of customers, and shared the same sender IP address. Based on observed\ninfrastructure, the two clusters share similar hosting providers, netblocks, and registrars. There are also dozens of unrelated domains\nthat appear to distribute RATs hosted on the same infrastructure.\n\n\nThreat\nCluster\n\n\nC2 IP Last\nSeen\n\n\nFirst\nSeen\n\n\nASN Host Org Netblock Country Registrar\n\n\nCPRS 185.140.53[.]189 9/22/21 9/22/21 AS208476 PRIVACYFIRST\n\nCPRS 79.134.225[.]107 9/20/21 9/7/21 AS6775 - FINKTELECOMSERVICES\n\nCPRS 79.134.225[.]92 8/11/21 1/22/21 AS6775 - FINKTELECOMSERVICES\n\nCPRS 185.244.30[.]70 1/9/21 1/6/21 AS208476 PRIVACYFIRST\n\nCPRS 185.140.53[.]225 12/27/20 12/14/20 AS208476 PRIVACYFIRST\n\n\nDanilenko,\nArtyom\n\nAndreas Fink\ntrading as Fink\nTelecom\nServices GmbH\n\nAndreas Fink\ntrading as Fink\nTelecom\nServices GmbH\n\nDanilenko,\nArtyom\n\nDanilenko,\nArtyom\n\n\n185.140.53[.]0/24 SE RIPE\n\n79.134.224[.]0/19 CH RIPE\n\n79.134.224[.]0/19 CH RIPE\n\n185.244.30[.]0/24 NL RIPE\n\n185.140.53[.]0/24 SE RIPE\n\n\n-----\n\nShahzad73 185.140.53[.]8 9/23/21 8/9/21 AS208476 PRIVACYFIRST\n\nShahzad73 185.19.85[.]139 7/29/21 5/11/21 AS48971 DATAWIRE-AS\n\nShahzad73 79.134.225[.]9 5/10/21 4/7/21 AS6775 - FINKTELECOMSERVICES\n\nShahzad73 91.212.153[.]84 4/4/21 2/2/21 AS24961 MYLOC-AS\n\n\nDanilenko,\nArtyom\n\n\nAndreas Fink\ntrading as Fink\nTelecom\nServices GmbH\n\nmyLoc managed\nIT AG\n\n\n185.140.53[.]0/24 SE RIPE\n\n\nDATAWIRE AG 185.19.84[.]0/22 CH RIPE\n\n\n79.134.224[.]0/19 CH RIPE\n\n91.212.153[.]0/24 DE RIPE\n\n\nAdditionally, Proofpoint identified a common registration email associated with multiple command and control IPs and domains that\noverlapped with the observed activity:\n\nanthony.marshall.1986@gmail[.]com\n\n[This email was previously associated with Adwind RAT campaigns reported in 2017.](https://abuse.ch/blog/adwind-a-cross-plattform-rat/)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nProofpoint assesses with high confidence TA2722 is a highly active threat actor leveraging Philippine government themes and targeting\na variety of organizations in Southeast Asia, Europe, and North America. It is likely this threat actor is attempting to gain remote access\nto target computers, which could be used for information gathering or to install follow-on malware or engage in business email\ncompromise (BEC) activity.\n\n## Example indicators of compromise:\n\nIndicator Description\n\nde5992f7c92351d1011fbece2d4bf74ecfc3b09f84aedb12997a2c3bf869de2c Remcos SHA256\n\n098fe3c8d0407e7438827fb38831dac4af8bd42690f8bd43d4f92fd2b7f33525 NanoCore SHA256\n\nshahzad73[.]casacam[.]net Remcos/NanoCore C2\n\nshahzad73[.]ddns[.]net Remcos/NanoCore C2\n\ncato[.]fingusti[.]club Remcos C2\n\nremcos[.]got-game[.]org Remcos C2\n\ninfo1@poea[.]gov[.]ph Sender Email\n\ncprs@customs[.]gov[.]ph Sender Email\n\nconsulate_ksa_emb@gmail[.]com Sender Email\n\nde5992f7c92351d1011fbece2d4bf74ecfc3b09f84aedb12997a2c3bf869de2c Remcos SHA256\n\n66.248.240[.]80 Sender IP\n\nSubscribe to the Proofpoint Blog\n\n\n-----",
