Within ATR we typically monitor many adversaries for years and collect and store data,\nranging from indicators of compromise (IOCs) to the TTPs.\n\nIn this report, ATR provides a deep insight into this long-term campaign where we will map out\nour findings against the Enterprise MITRE ATT&CK model. There will be parts that are censored\nsince we respect the confidentiality of the victim. We will also zoom in and look at how the\ntranslation to the MITRE Techniques, historical context, and evidence artifacts like PlugX and\nWinnti malware led to a link with another campaign, which we highly trust to be executed by the\nsame adversary.\n\nIOCs that could be shared are at the end of this document.\n\nMcAfee customers are protected from the malware/tools described in this blog. MVISION\nInsights customers will have the full details, IOCs and TTPs shared via their dashboard.\nMVISION Endpoint, EDR and UCE platforms provide signature and behavior-based prevention\nand detection capability for many of the techniques used in this attack. A more detailed blog with\nspecific recommendations on using the McAfee portfolio and integrated partner solutions to\n[defend against this attack can be found here.](https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/enterprise/mcafee-enterprise-atr/mcafee-defenders-blog-operation-harvest/)\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\n### Initial Infection Vectors [TA0001]\n\n\n-----\n\nForensic investigations identified that the actor established initial access by compromising the\n[victim’s web server [T1190]. On the webserver, software was installed to maintain the presence](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1190/)\n[and storage of tools [T1105] that would be used to gather information about the victim’s network](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1105/)\n\n[[T1083] and lateral movement/execution of files [T1570] [T1569.002]. Examples of the tools](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1083/)\ndiscovered are PSexec, Procdump, and Mimikatz.\n\n### Privilege Escalation and Persistence [TA0004, TA0003]\n\nThe adversary has been observed using multiple privilege escalation and persistence techniques\nduring the period of investigation and presence in the network. We will highlight a few in each\ncategory.\n\nBesides the use of Mimikatz to dump credentials, the adversaries used two tools for privilege\n[escalations [T1068]. One of the tools was “RottenPotato”. This is an open-source tool that is](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1068/)\nused to get a handle to a privileged token, for example, “NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM”, to be able\nto execute tasks with System rights.\n\nExample of RottenPotato on elevating these rights:\n\nFigure 1. RottenPotato\n\n**Figure 1. RottenPotato**\nThe second tool discovered, “BadPotato”, is another open-source tool that can be used to\nelevate user rights towards System rights.\n\nFigure 2. BadPotato\n\n**Figure 2. BadPotato**\nThe BadPotato code can be found on GitHub where it is offered as a Visual Studio project. We\ninspected the adversary’s compiled version using DotPeek and hunted for artifacts in the code.\nInspecting the File (COFF) header, we observed the file’s compilation timestamp:\n\n_TimeDateStamp: 05/12/2020 08:23:47 – Date and time the image was created_\n\n### PlugX\n\nAnother major and characteristic privilege escalation technique the adversary used in this longterm campaign was the malware PlugX as a backdoor. PlugX makes use of the technique “DLL\n[Sideloading” [T1574.002]. PlugX was observed as usual where a single (RAR) executable](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/)\ncontained the three parts:\n\nValid executable.\nAssociated DLL with the hook towards the payload.\nPayload file with the config to communicate with Command & Control Server (C2).\n\n\n-----\n\nThe adversary used either the standalone version or distributed three files on different assets in\nthe network to gain remote control of those assets. The samples discovered and analyzed were\ncommunicating towards two domains. Both domains were registered during the time of the\ncampaign.\n\nOne of the PlugX samples consisted of the following three parts:\n\nFilename Hashes\n\nHPCustPartic.exe SHA256:\n8857232077b4b0f0e4a2c3bb5717fd65079209784f41694f8e1b469e34754cf6\n\nHPCustPartUI.dll SHA256:\n0ee5b19ea38bb52d8ba4c7f05fa1ddf95a4f9c2c93b05aa887c5854653248560\n\nHPCustPartic.bin SHA256:\n008f7b98c2453507c45dacd4a7a7c1b372b5fafc9945db214c622c8d21d29775\n\nThe .exe file is a valid and signed executable and, in this case, an executable from HP (HP\nCustomer participation). We also observed other valid executables being used, ranging from AV\nvendors to video software. When the executable is run, the DLL next to it is loaded. The DLL is\nvalid but contains a small hook towards the payload which, in our case, is the .bin file. The DLL\nloads the PlugX config and injects it into a process.\n\nWe executed the samples in a test setup and dumped the memory of the machine to conduct\nmemory analysis with volatility. After the basic forensically sound steps, we ran the malfind plugin\nto detect possible injected code in a process. From the redacted output of the plugin, we\nobserved the following values for the process with possible injected code:\n\n_Process: svchost.exe Pid: 860 Address: 0xb50000_\n\n_Process: explorer.exe Pid: 2752 Address: 0x56a000_\n\n_Process: svchost.exe Pid: 1176 Address: 0x80000_\n\n_Process: svchost.exe Pid: 1176 Address: 0x190000_\n\n_Process: rundll32.exe Pid: 3784 Address: 0xd0000_\n\n_Process: rundll32.exe Pid: 3784 Address: 0x220000_\n\nOne observation is the mention of the SVCHOST process with a ProcessID value of 1176 that is\nmentioned twice but with different addresses. This is similar to the RUNDLL32.exe that is\nmentioned twice with PID 3785 and different addresses. One way to identify what malware may\nhave been used is to dump these processes with the relevant PID using the procdump module,\nupload them to an online analysis service and wait for the results. Since this is a very sensitive\ncase, we took a different approach. Using the best of both worlds (volatility and Yara) we used a\n\n\n-----\n\nruleset that consists of malware patterns observed in memory over time. Running this ruleset\nover the data in the memory dump revealed the following (redacted for the sake of readability)\noutput:\n\nFigure 3. Output Yarascan memory dump\n\n**Figure 3. Output Yarascan memory dump**\nThe output of the Yara rule scan (and there was way more output) confirmed the presence of\nPlugX module code in PID 1176 of the SVCHOST service. Also, the rule was triggered on PID\n3784, which belonged to RUNDLL32.exe.\n\nInvestigating the dumps after dynamic analysis, we observed two domain names used for C2\ntraffic:\n\nsery.brushupdata.com\ndnssery.brushupdata.com\n\nIn particular, we saw the following hardcoded value that might be another payload being\ndownloaded:\n\n_sery.brushupdata.com/CE1BC21B4340FEC2B8663B69_\n\n[The PlugX families we observed used DNS [T1071.001] [T1071.004] as the transport channel for](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1071/001/)\nC2 traffic, in particular TXT queries. Investigating the traffic from our samples, we observed the\ncheck-in-signature (“20 2A 2F 2A 0D”) that is typical for PlugX network traffic:\n\n_00000000:      47 45 54 20 2F 42 34 42 42 44 43 43 30 32 39 45_\n\n_00000010:      31 31 39 37 31 39 46 30 36 35 36 32 32 20 48 54_\n\n_00000020:      54 50 2F 31 2E 31 0D 0A 41 63 63 65 70 74 3A 20_\n\n_00000030:      2A 2F 2A 0D_ _0A 43 6F 6F 6B 69 65 3A 20 44 36 43_\n\n_00000040:      57 50 2B 56 5A 47 6D 59 6B 6D 64 6D 64 64 58 55_\n\n_00000050:      71 58 4D 31 71 31 6A 41 3D 0D 0A 55 73 65 72 2D_\n\nDuring our analysis of the different PlugX samples discovered, the domain names as mentioned\nabove stayed the same, though the payload values were different. For example:\n\nhxxp://sery.brushupdata.com/B4BBDCC029E119719F065622\nhxxp://sery.brushupdata.com/07FDB1B97D22EE6AF2482B1B\nhxxp://sery.brushupdata.com/273CDC0B9C6218BC1187556D\n\nOther PlugX samples we observed injected themselves into Windows Media Player and started a\nconnection with the following two domains:\n\ncenter.asmlbigip.com\n\n\n-----\n\nsec.asmlbigip.com\n\n### Hello Winnti\n\n[Another mechanism observed was to start a program as a service [T1543.003] on the Operating](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/)\nSystem with the acquired System rights by using the *Potato tools. The file the adversary was\nusing seemed to be a backdoor that was using the DLL file format\n(2458562ca2f6fabddae8385cb817c172).\n\nThe DLL is used to create a malicious service and its name is “service.dll”. The name of the\ncreated service, “SysmainUpdate”, is usurping the name of the legitimate service “SysMain”\nwhich is related to the legitimate DLL sysmain.dll and also to the Superfetch service. The dll is\nrun using the command “rundll32.exe SuperFrtch.dll, #1”. The export function has the name\n“WwanSvcMain”.\n\nThe model uses the persistence technique utilizing svchost.exe with service.dll to install a rogue\nservice. It appears that the dll employs several mechanisms to fingerprint the targeted system\nand avoid analysis in the sandbox, making analysis more difficult. The DLL embeds several\nobfuscated strings decoded when running. Once the fingerprinting has been done, the malware\nwill install the malicious service using the API RegisterServiceHandlerA then SetServiceStatus,\n[and finally CreateEventA. A description of the technique can be found here.](https://www.ired.team/offensive-security/persistence/persisting-in-svchost.exe-with-a-service-dll-servicemain)\n\nThe malware also decrypts and injects the payload in memory. The following screenshot shows\nthe decryption routine.\n\nFigure 4. Decryption routine\n\n**Figure 4. Decryption routine**\nWhen we analyzed this unique routine, we discovered similarities and the mention of it in a\n[publication that can be read here. The malware described in the article is attributed to the Winnti](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/17/c/winnti-abuses-github.html)\nmalware family. The operating method and the code used in the DLL described in the article are\nvery similar to our analysis and observations.\n\nThe process dump also revealed further indicators. Firstly, it revealed artifacts related to the DLL\nanalyzed, “C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows\\SuperfRtch\\SuperfRtch.dat”. We believe that this\ndat file might be the loaded payload.\n\nSecondly, while investigating the process dump, we observed activities from the backdoor that\nare part of the data exfiltration attempts which we will describe in more detail in this analysis\nreport.\n\nA redacted snippet of the code would look like this:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Creating archive_ _.rar_\n\n_Adding  [data from location]_\n\n_0%_\n\n_OK_\n\nAnother indicator of discovering Winnti malware was the following execution path we discovered\nin the command line dump of the memory:\n\n_cmd /c klcsngtgui.exe 1560413F7E <abbreviation-victim>.dat_\n\nWhat we observed here was the use of a valid executable, the AES 256 decryption key of the\npayload (.dat file). In this case, the payload file was named using an abbreviation of the victim\ncompany’s name. Unfortunately, the adversary had removed the payload file from the system.\nFile carving did not work since the disk/unallocated space was overwritten. However,\nreconstructing traces from memory revealed that we were dealing with the Winnti 4.0 malware.\nThe malware was injected into a SVCHOST process where a driver location pointed to the config\nfile. We observed in the process dump the exfiltration of data on the system, such as OS,\nProcessor (architecture), Domain, Username, etc.\n\nAnother clue that helped us was the use of DNS tunneling by Winnti which we discovered traces\nof in memory. The hardcoded 208.67.222.222 resolves to a legitimate OpenDNS DNS server.\nThe IP is pushed into the list generated by the malware at runtime. At the start of the malware, it\npopulates the list with the system’s DNS, and the OpenDNS server is only used as a backup to\nensure that the C2 domain is resolved.\n\nAnother indicator in the process dump was the setup of the C2 connection including the UserAgent that has been observed being used by Winnti 4.0 malware:\n\n_Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko)_\n_Chrome/57.0.2987.133 Safari/537.36_\n\n### Other Persistence Activities\n\n[WMI activity [T1546.003] was also observed to execute commands on the systems.](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/)\n\n[From a persistence point of view, scheduled tasks [T1053.005] and the use of valid accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053/)\n\n[[T1078] acquired through the use of Mimikatz, or creating LSASS dumps, were observed being](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/)\nemployed during the length of the campaign.\n\n## Lateral Movement\n\nFrom a lateral movement perspective, the adversary used the obtained credentials to hop from\nasset to asset. In one particular case, we observed a familiar filename: “PsExec.exe”. This\nSysInternals tool is often observed being used in lateral movement by adversaries, however, it\n\n\n-----\n\ncan also be used by the sysadmins of the network. In our case, the PsExec executable had a file\nsize of 9.6 MB where the original PsExec (depending on 32- or 64-bit version) had a maximum\nfile size of 1.3 MB. An initial static inspection of the file resulted in a blob of code that was\npresent in the executable which had a very high entropy score (7.99). When running the file from\nthe command line, the following output was observed:\n\nFigure 5. PsExec output\n\n**Figure 5. PsExec output**\nThe error notification and the ‘Impacket’ keyword tipped us off and, after digging around, we\nfound more. The fake PsExec is an open-source Python script that is a PsExec alternative with\nshell/backdoor capability. It uses a script from this location:\nhxxps://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/psexec.pyi. The file is large\nsince it incorporates a low-level protocol interaction from Impacket. The Python library combined\nwith the script code is compiled with py2exe. The file was compiled during the time of the latest\nattack activities and signed with an expired certificate.\n\n## Data Exfiltration\n\nFrom what we observed, the adversary had a long-term intention to stay present in the victim’s\nnetwork. With high confidence, we believe that the adversary was interested in stealing\nproprietary intelligence that could be used for military or intellectual property/manufacturing\npurposes.\n\nThe adversary used several techniques to exfiltrate the data. In some cases, batch (.bat) scripts\nwere created to gather information from certain network shares/folders and use the ‘rar’ tool to\n[compress them to a certain size [T1020] [T1030]. Example of content in a batch script:](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1020/)\n\n_C:\\Windows\\web\\rar.exe a -[redacted] -r -v50000 [Target-directory]_\n\nOn other occasions, manual variants of the above command were discovered after using the\ncustom backdoor as described earlier.\n\nWhen the data was gathered on a local system using the backdoor, the files were exfiltrated over\n[the backdoor and the rar files were deleted [T1070.004]. Where external facing assets were](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1070/)\nused, like a web server, the data was stored in a location in the Internet Information Services\n(IIS) web server and exfiltrated over HTTP using GET requests towards the exact file paths\n\n[[T1041] [T1567] [T1071].](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1041/)\n\nAn example of the [redacted] web traffic in the IIS logfiles:\n\n**Date /Time** **Request** **TCP Src port** **Source IP** **User-Agent**\n\nRedacted GET /****/[redacted].rar 80 180.50.*.* MINIXL\n\nredacted GET /****/[redacted].rar 80 209.58.*.* MINIXL\n\n\n-----\n\nThe source IP addresses discovered belonged to two different ISP/VPN providers based in\nHong-Kong.\n\nThe User-Agent value is an interesting one, “MINIXL”. When we researched that value, we\ndiscovered a blog from Dell SecureWorks from 2015 that mentions the same User-Agent, but\nalso a lot of the artifacts mentioned from the blog overlapped with the observations and TTPs of\n[Operation Harvest [link].](https://www.secureworks.com/research/threat-group-3390-targets-organizations-for-cyberespionage)\n\nWhat we could retrieve from open-source databases is that the use of this particular User-Agent\nis very limited and seems to originate from the APAC region.\n\n## Who did it?\n\nThat seems to be the one-million-dollar question to be asked. Within McAfee, attribution is not\nour main focus, protecting our customers is our priority. What we do care about is that if we learn\nabout these techniques during an investigation, can we map them out and support our IR team\non the ground, or a customer’s IR team, with the knowledge that can help determine which\nphase of the attack the evidence is pointing to and based on historical data and intelligence,\nassist in blocking the next phase and discover more evidence?\n\nWe started by mapping out all MITRE ATT&CK Enterprise techniques and sub-techniques,\nadded the tools used, and did a comparison against historical technique data from the industry.\nWe ended up with four groups that shared techniques and sub-techniques. The Winnti group\nwas added by us since we discovered the unique encryption function in the custom backdoor\nand indicators of the use of the Winnti malware.\n\nFigure 6. ATT&CK technique comparison\n\n**Figure 6. ATT&CK technique comparison**\nThe diagram reflecting our outcome insinuated that APT27 and APT41 are the most likely\ncandidates that overlap with the (sub-)techniques we observed.\n\nSince all these groups are in a certain time zone, we extracted all timestamps from the forensic\ninvestigation with regards to:\n\nRegistration of domain\nCompile timestamps of malware (considering deception)\nTimestamps of command-line activity\nTimestamps of data exfiltration\nTimestamps of malware interaction such as creation, deletion, etc.\n\nWhen we converted all these timestamps from UTC to the aforementioned groups’ time zones,\nwe ended up with the below scheme on activity:\n\nFigure 7. Adversary’s time of operation\n\n**Figure 7. Adversary’s time of operation**\n\n\n-----\n\nIn this campaign, we observed how the adversary mostly seems to work from Monday to\nThursday and typically during office hours, albeit with the occasional exception.\n\nCorrelating ATT&CK (sub-)techniques, timestamps, and tools like PlugX and Mimikatz are not\nthe only evidence indicators that can help to identify a possible adversary. Command-line syntax,\nspecific code similarity, actor capability over time versus other groups, and unique identifiers are\nat the top of the ‘pyramid of pain’ in threat intelligence. The bottom part of the pyramid is about\nhashes, URLs, and domains, areas that are very volatile and easy to change by an adversary.\n\nFigure 8. Pyramid of Pain\n\n**Figure 8. Pyramid of Pain**\nBeyond investigating those artifacts, we also took possible geopolitical interests and potential\ndeception into consideration when building our hypothesis. When we mapped out all of these, we\nbelieved that one of the two previously mentioned groups were responsible for the campaign we\ninvestigated.\n\nOur focus was not about attribution though, but more around where the flow of the attack is,\nmatches against previous attack flows from groups, and what techniques/tools they are using to\nblock next steps, or where to locate them. The more details we can gather at the top of ‘the\npyramid of pain’, the better we can determine the likely adversary and its TTP’s.\n\n## That’s all Folks!\n\nWell, not really. While correlating the observed (sub-)techniques, the malware families and code,\nwe discovered another targeted attack against a similar target in the same nation with the major\nmotivation of gathering intelligence. In the following diagram we conducted a high-level\ncomparison of the tools being used by the adversary:\n\nFigure 9. Tools comparison\n\n**Figure 9. Tools comparison**\nAlthough some of the tools are unique to each campaign, if taken into consideration over time\nwith when they were used, it makes sense. It demonstrates the development of the actor and\nuse of newer tools to conduct lateral movement and to obtain the required level of user rights on\nsystems.\n\nOverall, we observed the same modus operandi. Once an initial foothold was established, the\nadversary would deploy PlugX initially to create a few backdoors in the victim’s network in case\nthey were discovered early on. After that, using Mimikatz and dumping lsass, they were looking\nto get valid accounts. Once valid accounts were acquired, several tools including some of their\nown tools were used to gain information about the victim’s network. From there, several\nshares/servers were accessed, and information gathered. That information was exfiltrated as rar\nfiles and placed on an internet-facing server to hide in the ‘normal’ traffic. We represent that in\nthe following graphic:\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 10. Attack flow\n\n**Figure 10. Attack flow**\nIn the 2019/2020 case we also observed the use of a malware sample that we would classify as\npart of the Winnti malware family. We discovered a couple of files that were executed by the\nfollowing command:\n\n_Start Ins64.exe E370AA8DA0 Jumper64.dat_\n\nThe Winnti loader ‘Ins64.exe’ uses the value ‘E370AA8DA0’ to decrypt the payload from the .dat\nfile using the AES-256-CTR decryption algorithm and starts to execute.\n\nAfter executing this command and analyzing the memory, we observed a process injection in one\nof the svchost processes whereby one particular file was loaded from the following path:\n\n_C:\\programdata\\microsoft\\windows\\caches\\ieupdate.dll_\n\nFigure 11. Memory capture\n\n**Figure 11. Memory capture**\nThe malware started to open up both UDP and TCP ports to connect with a C2 server.\n\nUDP Port 20502\n\nTCP Port 20501\n\nFigure 12. Network connections to C2\n\n**Figure 12. Network connections to C2**\nCapturing the traffic from the malware we observed the following as an example:\n\nFigure 13. Winnti HTTP traffic to C2\n\n**Figure 13. Winnti HTTP traffic to C2**\nThe packet data was customized and sent through a POST request with several headers\ntowards the C2. In the above screenshot the numbers after “POST /” were randomly generated.\n\nThe User-Agent is a good network indicator to identify the Winnti malware since it is used in\nmultiple variants:\n\n_Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko)_\n_Chrome/50.0.2661.94 Safari/537.36_\n\nIndeed, the same User Agent value was discovered in the Winnti sample in Operation Harvest\nand seems to be typical for this malware family.\n\nThe cookie value consists of four Dword hex values that contain information about the\ncustomized packet size using a XOR value.\n\n\n-----\n\n[We learned more about the packet structure of Winnti from this link.](https://github.com/TKCERT/winnti-detector)\n\nApplying what we learned about the handshake, we observed the following in our traffic sample:\n\nDword value 0 = 52 54 00 36\n\nDword value 1 = 3e ff 06 b2\n\nDword value 2 = 99 6d 78 fe\n\nDword value 3 = 08 00 45 00\n\nDword value 4 = 00 34 00 47\n\n**Initial handshake order:**\n\nFigure 14.\n\nBased on our cross-correlation with samples and other OSINT resources, we believe with a high\nconfidence that this was a Winnti 4.0 sample that connects with a confirmed Winnti C2 server.\n\nThe identified C2 server was 185.161.211.97 TCP/80.\n\n### Timeline of Events\n\nWhen analyzing the timestamps from this investigation, like we did for operation Harvest, we\ncame to the below overview:\n\nFigure 15. Beijing working hours case 2019/2020\n\n**Figure 15. Beijing working hours case 2019/2020**\nAgain, we observed that the adversary was operating Monday to Friday during office hours in the\nBeijing time-zone.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOperation Harvest has been a long-term operation whereby an adversary maintained access for\nmultiple years to exfiltrate data. The exfiltrated data would have either been part of an intellectual\nproperty theft for economic purposes and/or would have provided insights that would be\nbeneficial in case of military interventions. The adversaries made use of techniques very often\nobserved in this kind of attack but also used distinctive new backdoors or variants of existing\nmalware families. Combining all forensic artifacts and cross-correlation with historical and\ngeopolitical data, we have high confidence that this operation was executed by an experienced\nAPT actor.\n\nAfter mapping out all data, TTP’s etc., we discovered a very strong overlap with a campaign\nobserved in 2019/2020. A lot of the (in-depth) technical indicators and techniques match. Also\nputting it into perspective, and over time, it demonstrates the adversary is adapting skills and\n\n\n-----\n\nevolving the tools and techniques being used.\n\nOn a separate note, we observed the use of the Winnti malware. We deliberately mention the\nterm ‘malware’ instead of group. The Winnti malware is known to be used by several actors.\nWithin every nation-state cyber-offensive activity, there will be a department/unit responsible for\nthe creation of the tools/malware, etc. We strongly believe that is exactly what we observe here\nas well. PlugX, Winnti and some other custom tools all point to a group that had access to the\nsame tools. Whether we put name ‘X’ or ‘Y’ on the adversary, we strongly believe that we are\ndealing with a Chinese actor whose long-term objectives are persistence in their victims’\nnetworks and the acquisition of the intelligence needed to make political/strategic or\nmanufacturing decisions.\n\n### MITRE ATT&CK Techniques\n\n\n**Technique**\n**ID**\n\n\n**Technique Title** **Context Campaign**\n\n\nT1190 Exploit Publicfacing application\n\nT1105 Ingress Tool\ntransfer\n\nT1083 File & Directory\nDiscovery\n\nT1570 Lateral Tool\nTransfer\n\nT1569.002 System Services:\nService Execution\n\nT1068 The exploitation of\nPrivilege\nEscalation\n\nT1574.002 Hijack Execution\nFlow: DLL SideLoading\n\nT1543.003 Create or Modify\nSystem\nProcess: Windows\nService\n\nT1546.003 Event-Triggered\nExecution: WMI\nEvent\nSubscription\n\n\nAdversary exploited a web-facing server with application\n\nTools were transferred to a compromised web-facing server\n\nAdversary browsed several locations to search for the data\nthey were after.\n\nAdversary transferred tools/backdoors to maintain\npersistence\n\nAdversary installed custom backdoor as a service\n\nAdversary used Rotten/Bad Potato to elevate user rights by\nabusing API calls in the Operating System.\n\nAdversary used PlugX malware that is famous for DLLSide-Loading using a valid executable, a DLL with the hook\ntowards a payload file.\n\nAdversary launched backdoor and some tools as a\nWindows Service including adding of registry keys\n\nWMI was used for running commands on remote systems\n\n\n-----\n\nT1053.005 Scheduled task Adversary ran scheduled tasks for persistence of certain\nmalware samples\n\nT1078 Valid accounts Using Mimikatz and dumping of lsass, the adversary gained\ncredentials in the network\n\n\nT1020 Automated\nexfiltration\n\nT1030 Data transfer size\nlimits\n\nT1070.004 Indicator removal\non host\n\nT1041 Exfiltration over\nC2 channel\n\nT1567 Exfiltration over\nWeb Service\n\nT1071.004 Application layer\nprotocol: DNS\n\n\nThe PlugX malware exfiltrated data towards a C2 and\nreceived commands to gather more information about the\nvictim’s compromised host.\n\nAdversary limited the size of rar files for exfiltration\n\nWhere in the beginning of the campaign the adversary was\nsloppy, during the last months of activity they became more\ncareful and started to remove evidence\n\nAdversary used several C2 domains to interact with\ncompromised hosts.\n\nGathered information was stored as ‘rar’ files on the\ninternet-facing server, whereafter they were downloaded by\na specific ip range.\n\nUsing DNS tunneling for the C2 traffic of the PlugX malware\n\n\n## Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)\n\nNote: the indicators shared are to be used in a historical and timeline-based context, ranging\nfrom 2016 to March 2021.\n\n## Operation Harvest:\n\n**PlugX C2:**\n\nsery(.)brushupdata(.)com\n\nDnssery(.)brushupdata(.)com\n\nCenter(.)asmlbigip(.)com\n\n**Tools:**\n\nMimikatz\n\nPsExec\n\nRottenPotato\n\nBadPotato\n\n\n-----\n\n## Operation 2019/2020\n\n**PlugX malware:**\n\nf50de0fae860a5fd780d953a8af07450661458646293bfd0fed81a1ff9eb4498\n\n26e448fe1105b5dadae9b7607e3cca366c6ba8eccf5b6efe67b87c312651db01\n\ne9033a5db456af922a82e1d44afc3e8e4a5732efde3e9461c1d8f7629aa55caf\n\n3124fcb79da0bdf9d0d1995e37b06f7929d83c1c4b60e38c104743be71170efe\n\n**Winnti:**\n\n800238bc27ca94279c7562f1f70241ef3a37937c15d051894472e97852ebe9f4\n\nc3c8f6befa32edd09de3018a7be7f0b7144702cb7c626f9d8d8d9a77e201d104\n\ndf951bf75770b0f597f0296a644d96fbe9a3a8c556f4d2a2479a7bad39e7ad5f\n\nWinnti C2: 185.161.211.97\n\n**Tools:**\n\nPSW64         6e983477f72c8575f8f3ff5731b74e20877b3971fa2d47683aff11cfd71b48c6\n\nNTDSDumpEx 6db8336794a351888636cb26ebefb52aeaa4b7f90dbb3e6440c2a28e4f13ef96\n\nNBTSCAN       c9d5dc956841e000bfd8762e2f0b48b66c79b79500e894b4efa7fb9ba17e4e9e\n\nNetSess        ddeeedc8ab9ab3b90c2e36340d4674fda3b458c0afd7514735b2857f26b14c6d\n\nSmbexec       e781ce2d795c5dd6b0a5b849a414f5bd05bb99785f2ebf36edb70399205817ee\n\nWmiexec\n14f0c4ce32821a7d25ea5e016ea26067d6615e3336c3baa854ea37a290a462a8\n\nMimikatz\n\nRAR command-line\n\nTCPdump\n\n\n-----",
