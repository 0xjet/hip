The forum emerged at the domain that\npreviously hosted the Babuk ransomware data leak site and later the Payload.bin leak site.\nKELA researched the contents of the new site and assessed its chances to succeed.\n\n*All the forum contents are described based on what KELA observed on RAMP until July 27,\n2021, when the access became was restricted.\n\n## Background\n\nThe Babuk ransomware group came into the spotlight at the beginning of the year 2021 but\nthe gang [said that their attacks have started in October 2020. The group operated as](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/babuk-ransomware-is-back-uses-new-version-on-corporate-networks/)\nransomware-as-a-service (RaaS), and was publicly hiring affiliates on two major Russianspeaking forums, XSS and Exploit, since March 2021.\n\nOne of the gang’s most notable attacks was carried out against Washington DC’s\nMetropolitan Police Department that took place in April 2021. The gang said they had\ncompromised the DC Police’s networks and stolen 250 GB of unencrypted files. Some of\nthem were published on their site.\n\n_Babuk posts claiming to have compromised Washington DC’s Metropolitan Police Department_\n\n\n-----\n\nShortly after the attack, the chaos surrounding the Babuk RaaS closure started. First, the\ngang stated it is closing the operation and promised to publish the source code of its\nmalware to enable other threat actors to create their own ransomware. Then, the Babuk\nransomware developers deleted the post and published a new announcement claiming they\nplan to continue breaching companies but instead of stealing sensitive files and encrypting\nlocal data, the group plans only to steal it. However, that second announcement was also\ndeleted. On May 15, 2021, the Babuk representative stated on one of the forums that their\nRaaS affiliate program was closed.\n\n_Babuk announcements of coming changes of their leak site and RaaS_\n\nOn June 1, 2021, KELA observed several changes in the content and appearance of the\nBabuk site. The domain used by Babuk showed a page titled “Payload.bin” with the following\nmessage on the front page: “Welcome to Leaks site created by Payload.bin.” It appeared\nthat this Payload.bin site was the promised site for leaking the stolen data.\n\nHowever, only one victim was listed on the site – Polish game developer CD Projekt Red.\nInterestingly enough, the company fell victim to HelloKitty ransomware in February 2021.\nThen, the data allegedly stolen during the attack was traded on an auction on the cybercrime\nforum Exploit. The sellers claimed the data was sold outside of the forum. Interestingly, one\nof the RAMP users asked about the origins of this leak being posted on Payload.bin. The\nadmin claimed the Babuk gang did not attack the company and they just provided a place for\nthe leak: “The Babuk team never had anything to do with this project, we were just asked to\npost it, so I provided the material as it is.”\n\n\n-----\n\n_The leak of CD Projekt’s data on Payload.bin and an explanation of this leak on RAMP_\n\n[On June 27, 2021, a builder (source code) for the Babuk ransomware was uploaded](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/82e560a078cd7bb4472d5af832a04c4bc8f1001bac97b1574efe9863d3f66550/detection) to\nVirusTotal. This builder could be used to create custom versions of the Babuk ransomware\nand generate decrypters. Researchers speculated the code could be leaked by former\nmembers of the groups or rivals.\n\nOn July 1, 2021, it became known that Babuk launched a new leak site stating the operation\ncontinues under the name Babuk 2.0. The gang claimed the old version of Babuk\nransomware was leaked, while the new version is being used in ongoing attacks.\n\nOn July 12, 2021, KELA noticed that the former Babuk ransomware gang’s leak site had\nchanged again and was now hosting a forum named RAMP. A new admin initially named\nTetyaSluha (now Orange) announced it is now a place where ransomware affiliates can be\nprotected from unscrupulous RaaS programs. The admin claimed that following the\nransomware ban on other forums, he wanted to create a new community. The name of the\nnew forum is a reference to the now-defunct Russian Anonymous Marketplace (a drug\nmarket that closed in 2017). So the big question comes down to: What’s in this\n_“marketplace”?_\n\n\n-----\n\n## The Admin’s Connections to Babuk\n\nThe fact that the RAMP site is hosted on the same domain that once was Babuk’s leak site\nand then Payload.bin hints that the administrator is somehow related to Babuk. On May 13,\n2021, in the post promising to leak the data of Washington DC’s Metropolitan Police\nDepartment, the author stated: “I handed over the source code to another team, which will\ncontinue to develop the product under a different brand, I remain the only owner of the\ndomain and blog, my service will continue to develop.” It seems that the post author is the\nfuture admin of Payload.bin and RAMP.\n\n_Announcement about handing over source code and remaining an owner of the domain, most likely_\n_written by the current RAMP admin_\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen announcing the forum’s opening, the admin stated: “[If you want to know – KELA] who\nI am you can search online for the babuk key.” The mention of “Babuk key” probably meant\nthe builder leak mentioned above. In addition, the admin said: “All this activity that grew into\nthe RAMP forum is the result of my year’-long work in the field and the competent\nmanipulation of journalists from top outlets, such as Bloomberg, and so on. I promoted this\ndomain through blood and sweat.” This again implies that the admin was involved in the\nBabuk operation from the beginning.\n\n_The RAMP admin’s announcement about the RAMP launch and his affiliation with the Babuk team and the_\n_domain_\n\nMoreover, when sharing the Babuk builder on RAMP, the admin claimed: “A guy who made\nBabuk for me just took the Darkside ESX locker and reversed it. I can’t tell if there is a\nproblem with the ESX [version] because I’ve used it only for three companies.” From this and\nother posts sharing insights on how to attack the company’s network, we can suggest that\nthe admin was conducting ransomware attacks by himself.\n\nThe admin said that now he is not affiliated with the gang and even stated: “I recommend to\nblacklist this product to all security firms and data security [specialists].”\n\n\n-----\n\n_The RAMP admin’s post about the Babuk ESXi version being based on the DarkSide ESXi version_\n\n## RAMP Forum’s Contents\n\nThe new forum is Russian-speaking and named RAMP in honor of the now-defunct Russian\ndrug marketplace, but its purpose is far away from selling drugs. The admin who renamed\nhimself to Orange (the old RAMP’s admin’s handle) claimed the forum will be a community\nfor various cybercriminals, including ransomware developers and affiliates recently banned\non XSS and Exploit. He stated the forum’s full name is “Ransom Anon Mark Place.”\n\nRules of the forum stated that members are prohibited from attacking Russia and CIS\n[countries (which is common for such forums), using multiple accounts, spamming, and](https://securityboulevard.com/2021/07/how-and-why-hacker-forums-self-moderate/)\nperforming some other actions. Curiously, the moderators claimed it is prohibited to\npropagate “different actions going against Criminal Code of RF [Russian Federation].”\n\n\n-----\n\n_RAMP rules_\n\nThe forum has multiple sections typical for such cybercrime forums, with a general notice\n“welcoming” both RaaS and other services. Two sections that attract a particular interest are\ncalled “Vendor” and “Affiliate Programs” – they are intended for “people and services in\nwhich we [administration – KELA] and our community trust.” As such, KELA observed a\nthread dedicated to the LockBit 2.0 affiliate program thread. In the thread, a user named\nLockBit (most likely the gang’s representative) claimed he will launch the LockBit 2.0\nransomware ESXi version soon.\n\n\n-----\n\n_LockBit 2.0 thread on RAMP_\n\nSince Initial Access Brokers’ services are on the rise, the forum offers a section for access\nlistings. Moreover, in honor of the forum’s launch, some accesses through Fortinet VPN were\noffered for free. The access listings seem to be unique; the forum moderators promised to\nchange them periodically to avoid multiple targeting.\n\nThe forum also has a section “Tools” for selling/sharing exploits and malware, though its\ncontents so far do not seem to be unique. Interestingly, the Babuk builder was shared again\nin this section by the admin who specified that the builder works fine for\nencrypting/decrypting files on Windows computers. He mentioned that the VMware ESXi\nversion does not enable users to decrypt files.\n\nOther sections are intended for sharing articles about hacking, chatting, and discussing the\nforum.\n\n## The Spam Incident and the Building of the Forum\n\nThe site, built on the FluxBB engine, experienced a spam attack. On July 23, 2021, a threat\nactor created a thread where he demanded a 5,000 USD ransom to avoid spamming.\nApparently, the admin didn’t pay the ransom and over a few coming days, multiple users\nwere posting porn GIFs in all sections and threads in the forum. Following the incident, many\nusers were deleted from the forum. The admin (who previously looked for someone capable\n\n\n-----\n\nof auditing the forum s security for 2,000 USD) stated the forum will be relaunched using a\nnew engine built from scratch. First, the admin “cleaned” the forum and deleted most of the\nusers. On July 27, 2021, he restricted access to the forum.\n\n_The RAMP admin’s announcement of looking for a specialist to make a security audit of the forum_\n\n## Forum’s Perspectives\n\nThe forum seemed to attract some interest from members of other cybercrime forums: KELA\nobserved several users registered with the same handles as on two major Russian-speaking\nforums. Due to the “cleaning” of the forum, on July 26, 2021, the number of users was 59\nwho seem to be the users that somehow participated in the forum discussion. During the first\nten days of its existence and before the wave of spammers the number of registered users\nwas around 350. The number of published posts was above 100.\n\nThis pace was impressive, however, after the spam incident and deleting of the users it will\ndefinitely slow down. The registration is now closed. According to a message now appearing\non the homepage, on August 13, 2021, the forum will be relaunched and registration will\nbecome available based on certain conditions. Those include users registered on XSS and\nExploit for more than 2 months, with more than 10 messages on a forum and a positive\nreputation. An alternative option is to pay a registration fee of 500 USD, which seems to be\nexaggerated compared to other forums. For example, a premium user on XSS costs 120\nUSD for a year. Moreover, Russian cybercriminals are not used to paying money for\nregistration on forums, especially such a (relatively) big sum.\n\nOnce the forum will be relaunched, it is possible that cybercrime actors tired of the\nransomware ban will try it out. So far, the welcoming of the RaaS programs and their\naffiliates is the only competitive advantage of RAMP. It seems it is the only factor that can\nattract users from other well-established forums. As for the demand of ransomware groups\nfor Initial Access Brokers, intrusion specialists, and other partners, they can still find them on\nexisting forums.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Frontpage of RAMP as seen on July 26 and on July 27, 2021_\n\nThe success of the forum also depends on the interest of ransomware groups in publicly\nrecruiting affiliates again. Some players (like Avaddon and REvil) closed their RaaS or\ndisappeared from the public space. However, there are new groups that can use a new\ncommunity to promote their RaaS. If the admins can leverage their competitive advantage of\nwelcoming RaaS programs, chances to grow are fairly high.\n\n\n-----",
