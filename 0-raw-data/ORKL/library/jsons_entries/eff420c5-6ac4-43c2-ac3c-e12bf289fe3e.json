It is a Poison Ivy sample\n[(b08694e14a9b966d8033b42b58ab727d). The sample connects to a C2 server at](https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/af69ad95e6564d682b0f8220dd8c4cca61b60227add59c883eea960350747084/analysis/)\njs001.3322[.]org. Incidentally, the connection password used by the sample is “xiaoxiaohuli”,\nChinese for “littlelittlefox” (小小狐狸), a useful data point that helps to confirm the connection\nto China.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe FireEye Poison Ivy report containing menuPass samples\n**js001.3322[.]org to 222.35.137[.]193**\n\nIn 2010, around the time of this APT10 activity, the domain js001.3322[.]org resolved to IP\naddress 222.35.137[.]193, an IP address in Beijing, China.\n\nThe IP address 222.35.137[.]193 has other connections to APT10 too. A search of other\ndomains that have resolved to the IP reveals that weile3322b.3322[.]org resolved to the IP\nbetween 23 January 2010 and 15 February 2012. The weile3322b domain is listed as an\nAPT10 domain in commercial threat intelligence reporting. The IP address can therefore be\nsaid to have been associated with APT10 for a significant period of time.\n\n**222.35.137[.]193 to Tianjin, China**\n\n[Analysis of a further Poison Ivy malware sample (a4754be7b34ed55faff832edadac61f6) from](https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/81d634888b069313492b30f737ed07085f335d1cc29964050514412bf5d4b7d1/analysis/1265261874/)\nearly 2010 indicates that it connected to the same 222.35.137[.]193 IP address in Beijing.\nThis malware was initially distributed in an e-mail phishing campaign originating from\n[masao_tomikawas[at]yahoo.com. There is a complete analysis available at Contagio.](http://contagiodump.blogspot.com/2010/02/feb-1-darkmoon-b-videoexe-with.html)\n\n\n-----\n\nAnalysis of an APT10 spam e-mail originating from 218.67.128[.]26Inspection of the SMTP\nheaders for the original e-mail campaign reveals the originating IP address of the campaign,\n218.67.128[.]26. That IP address resolves to China Unicom in Tianjin. Whoever is behind\nAPT10, therefore, could well be based in Tianjin.\n\n218.67.128[.]26 sits inside an IP block that resolves to Tianjin, Chinafisherxp\nAlso hidden in the SMTP headers of the spam e-mail is the hostname of the computer that\nsubmitted the e-mail – fisherxp-pc[.]domain. fisherxp is a relatively unique name that we\nbelieve has been used by one of the APT10 actors for some time.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Twitter account @fisherxp was registered in January 2010 and has posted 11 times. Most](https://twitter.com/fisherxp)\nare hacking or information security related retweets in English or Chinese.\n\nfisherxp Twitter account\nIn further confirmation of the account owner’s association with (or at least interest in) APT10,\n[the account began following @intrusion_truth the day after this blog exposed APT10 actor](https://twitter.com/intrusion_truth)\nZheng Yanbin.\n\n[@fisherxp is also a valid Tencent Weibo QQ account containing a photo of, presumably, the](http://t.qq.com/fisherxp)\nowner of the account.\n\nfisherxp’s QQ account\nThe QQ feed contains years worth of postings. Amongst them is a photograph of a car\nbelonging to the owner of the feed. It had been involved in an accident and bears Tianjin\nlicense plates.\n\n\n-----\n\nfisherxp’s car with Tianjin license plates\nThe same photograph of the individual is associated with the ‘fisherxp’ account on a\n[Wayback Machine copy of a website for natives of Shandong province now living in Tianjin.](https://web.archive.org/web/20110113022538/http://tjsdr.5d6d.com/space-uid-1304.html)\n\nA second site (from archive.org) showing the same photo of fisherxp\n**Mr Gao**\n\n[Some years ago, in a post (since removed) on job.51cto.com, a user using the username](http://job.51cto.com/info/company_info.php?username=fisherxp)\nfisherxp posted a job advert for the Tianjin Huaying Haitai Science and Technology\nDevelopment Company (天津华盈海泰科技发展有限公司). The poster used the name ‘Mr\nGao’ and telephone number +86 150 22550833.\n\nUnfortunately the fisherxp account was removed from the job section of the website before\n[Intrusion Truth could obtain a screenshot. Never-the-less an associated account with the](http://down.51cto.com/424761)\nsame username remains on other parts of the site\n\n\n-----\n\nTraces of the fisherxp account on 51cto.com\nThe name Gao and the same telephone number were also previosuly used online as contact\ndetails for Laoying Baichen Instruments Equipment Co. A Mr Gao listed as the contact and\nthe address is given as Room 1102, Guanfu Mansion, 46 Xinkai Road, Hedong District,\nTianjin (天津市河东区新开路46号冠福大厦1102).\n\nThe postcode of the Guanfu Mansion on Xinkai Road is 300011, as confirmed by several\nunrelated postings online relating to different companies in the same building. The 300011\npostcode will prove important later.\n\n**Gao Qiang**\n\nIdentifying an individual in Tianjin with the surname Gao isn’t easy, But cyber threat\nintelligence analysts following APT10 closely, and working with this blog, have confirmed that\nthe photo of fisherxp shown above was previously used online by Tianjin resident Gao\nQiang, including on his Facebook page.\n\n**In summary, fisherxp, a username probably used by Gao Qiang, was associated with**\n**hacking activity linked to known APT10 command and control servers. He is based in**\n**Tianjin, China and has probably worked for at least two companies in the city.**\n\n\n-----",
