AppleSeed is a backdoor malware mainly used by the\nKimsuky group. It stays in the system and performs malicious behaviors by receiving\ncommands from attackers.\n\n[Analysis Report on Kimsuky Group’s APT Attacks (AppleSeed, PebbleDash)](https://asec.ahnlab.com/en/30532/)\n\nThe malware is currently being distributed under the following filenames.\n\nPurchase order-**-2022****-001-National Tax Service additionally implementing\nsecurity sensors in 5 regional tax offices_***.jse\nRequest form(general manager ***).jse\n\nThe JSE (JScript Encoded File) file consists of JavaScript, and when it is run, it drops\nAppleSeed backdoor file (DLL file) and the purchase order PDF file that acts as bait in the\n%ProgramData% path. After then, PDF file is automatically run (see Figure 2).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1. Dropping malware and PDF file used as bait\n\nFigure 2. Details of PDF file\nThe file uses regsvr32.exe to decode and run the backdoor file (area shaded with purple)\nand mshta.exe to download and run additional scripts (area shaded with red).\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3. Running AppleSeed and downloading additional scripts\nWhen the scripts are run, the following information is stolen and sent to the C2.\n\nBasic information of the PC (PC name, OS version, processor, and memory)\nUser account credentials\nNetwork information (IP address, routing table, port usage information, and ARP list)\nList of running processes and services\nFolders and files within ProgramFiles / Programs within the Start menu / List of recent\nfiles\n\nFigure 4. Information stolen using additionally downloaded scripts\nThe AppleSeed backdoor file continuously receives commands from the C2 server to\ndownload and run additional modules, or perform behaviors that the attacker wishes to\n[perform. For a detailed analysis of AppleSeed, refer to the following link.](https://download.ahnlab.com/global/brochure/Analysis%20Report%20of%20Kimsuky%20Group.pdf)\n\nThe figure below shows the overall process tree after the scripts are run.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5. Process tree\nBecause the bait file is also run, users normally cannot recognize that their systems are\ninfected by malware. As the files mentioned above mainly target certain companies, users\nshould refrain from running attachments in emails sent from unknown sources.\n\nAhnLab’s anti-malware software, V3, is currently detecting and blocking the files using the\nfollowing aliases.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6.
