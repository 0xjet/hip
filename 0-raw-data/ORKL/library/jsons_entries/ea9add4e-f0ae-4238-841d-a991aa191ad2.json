    "plain_text": "# The destruction of APT3\n\n**[intrusiontruth.wordpress.com/2018/05/22/the-destruction-of-apt3/](https://intrusiontruth.wordpress.com/2018/05/22/the-destruction-of-apt3/)**\n\nintrusiontruth May 22, 2018\n\nTwelve months have passed since this blog exposed Wu Yingzhuo, Dong Hao, their\ncompany ‘Boyusec’ and the Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS) as being behind APT3.\nAPT3 was, at the time, one of the most damaging APT attacks to hit Western companies.\nOne year on, we take a look back at what happened after our publication.\n\n**The disappearance of APT3**\n\n[We published our explosive analysis in April and May 2017. It was the first time that the](https://intrusiontruth.wordpress.com/2017/05/09/apt3-is-boyusec-a-chinese-intelligence-contractor/)\nChinese Intelligence Services had been conclusively linked to an APT and followed similar\nrevelations, years previously, linking People’s Liberation Army (PLA) Unit 61398 to APT1.\n\nThe Boyusec website went offline the morning after the exposure and it hasn’t been back\nonline since.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe morning after, on boyusec.com\nBoyusec disappeared into the shadows without making any effort to contact us or to refute\nany of the conclusions of our analysis. These were not the actions of innocent individuals.\n\n[Where did these guys run off to? Perhaps not proud of their work as APT3? #buckeye](https://twitter.com/hashtag/buckeye?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n[#gothicpanda](https://twitter.com/hashtag/gothicpanda?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [#apt3](https://twitter.com/hashtag/apt3?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [#boyusec](https://twitter.com/hashtag/boyusec?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [#cyber](https://twitter.com/hashtag/cyber?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [pic.twitter.com/0lIzSIzxjd](https://t.co/0lIzSIzxjd)\n\n[— Intrusion Truth (@intrusion_truth) May 10, 2017](https://twitter.com/intrusion_truth/status/862432218475528192?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n**Corroboration by the community**\n\nA fortnight after our publication, a series of articles appeared online drawing on our work and\ncorroborating it. Our analysis formed the basis of articles by, among others, [Security Week,](https://www.securityweek.com/apt3-hackers-linked-chinese-ministry-state-security)\n[Dark Reading,](https://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/apt3-threat-group-a-contractor-for-chinese-intelligence-agency/d/d-id/1328913) [Recorded Future,](https://www.recordedfuture.com/chinese-mss-behind-apt3/) [Threat Post and](https://threatpost.com/apt3-linked-to-chinese-ministry-of-state-security/125750/) [Security Lab. The Information Security](https://www.securitylab.ru/news/486182.php)\ncommunity agreed with our conclusion that Boyusec and MSS were behind the APT3\nattacks. “There has been a lot of accumulated evidence that these guys are tied to the state”\n[John Hultquist, Director of Analysis at FireEye, said to Foreign Policy magazine.](http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/11/30/feds-quietly-reveal-chinese-state-backed-hacking-operation/)\n\n\n-----\n\nThreat Post coverage based on Intrusion Truth analysis\n**US Government charges Wu and Dong**\n\nBut the story doesn’t quite end there. Six months after our publications the US Justice\nDepartment unsealed indictments against Wu Yingzhuo, Dong Hao and Xia Lei for computer\nhacking, theft of trade secrets, conspiracy and identity theft. They had been prepared in\nSeptember 2017.\n\nThree US victims were identified in the indictment – Trimble, Siemens and Moody’s Analytics\n– one for each of the ‘co-conspirators’.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe indictment document released by the US Government\nThough the indictments didn’t mention the Chinese Government, Justice Department\nspokesman Wyn Hornbuckle said that prosecutors only “included the allegations that we are\n_prepared to prove in court with admissible evidence”._\n\nWu, Dong and Xia are no longer able to travel internationally without fear of arrest and trial.\nThe maximum sentence for their crimes? 20 years.\n\n**Contractors vs employees**\n\nThe Chinese Intelligence Service, MSS, had perhaps tried to be more careful than their\nmilitary colleagues in the People’s Liberation Army. They used commercial hackers rather\nthan government employees, probably thinking that it lent them some additional deniability.\nBut, given that the company involved was identified as MSS-tasked in any case, that choice\nmay have been a mistake.\n\nAs private citizens, Wu, Dong and Xia are vulnerable to action by other countries that may\nchoose to treat them as common criminals rather than government officials. The three have\nalready been charged by the US government and now risk being arrested, deported, tried\nand imprisoned.\n\n\n-----\n\n**What happened to APT3?**\n\nThis blog has been contacted by several InfoSec professionals who had been following\nAPT3. Without exception they reported a complete cessation of APT3 activity in May 2017.\nFollowing the US indictment announcement in November 2017, the Wall Street Journal also\n[reported that Boyusec had been disbanded.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-firm-behind-alleged-hacking-was-disbanded-this-month-1511881494)\n\nThe Wall Street Journal claims that Boyusec was disbanded in late 2017\nIn addition to the evidence above, the press release announcing the American indictments\nagainst Wu, Dong and Xia refers to May 2017 as the final date of their activity. Our\nconclusion? It seems that APT3 is no more.\n\n**What’s next?**\n\nThe ‘P’ in APT stands for Persistent. But this episode goes to show that Chinese APT\nhackers will only persist whilst their activity remains anonymous. APT3 was one of the\nbiggest APT threats to Western companies, yet it was completely silenced by shining a light\non its activities and exposing the identities of those behind the group to the world.\n\nAnalysts working with this blog are continuing their efforts to identify the individuals,\ncompanies and state institutions behind the damaging attacks that hit the West. We have\naccumulated evidence on several groups over the last twelve months and hope to share\nsome of it soon.\n\n\n-----",
