This compromise is\nexactly the kind of attack we were concerned about when discussing the danger in a\n[previous compromise that we uncovered just a few weeks ago against another government](https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/bangladesh-embassy-website-in-cairo-compromised/)\nsite, at that time the Bangladesh Embassy in Cairo.\n\nThe compromised Pakistani domain, tracking.dgip.gov[.]pk, is a subdomain of the\nDirectorate General of Immigration & Passport of the Pakistani government that allows\npassport applicants to track the status of their application. Visitors to the site load the\nScanbox javascript code from a remote location. This code collects information about the\nvisitor’s machine as well as log any keystrokes the visitor makes while using the site, for\nexample when logging into the tracking system.\n\nIn this version that we observed, Scanbox also tried to detect whether the visitor has any of\na list of 77 endpoint products installed, most of these are security products, with a few\ndecompression and virtualization tools.\n\n[Scanbox Framework is a reconnaissance framework that was first mentioned back in 2014](https://www.alienvault.com/blogs/labs-research/scanbox-a-reconnaissance-framework-used-on-watering-hole-attacks)\nand has been linked over the years to several different APT groups. Its intense activity\n[during the 2014-2015 years has been well-covered in a paper written by PwC. It was then](http://pwc.blogs.com/files/cto-tib-20150223-01a.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\n[seen again in 2017 suspected to be used by the Stone Panda APT group, and once more](https://www.fidelissecurity.com/threatgeek/cyberdefense)\nin [2018 in connection with LuckyMouse.](https://securelist.com/luckymouse-hits-national-data-center/86083/)\n\nScanbox was used in a variety of watering hole attacks, meaning the attacker infected a site\nwith Scanbox in order to gather information about visitors to the site (gathering all the\ninformation you’d expect like IP, referrer, OS, User Agent, plugins, etc.) to, later on, tailor\nsophisticated targeted attacks for interesting visitors. With every appearance, it seems to\nhave evolved in terms of the kinds of information it gathers.\n\nDespite the severity of this infection, scans show an alarming lack of detection for this\ncompromised site by security products:\n\n_Figure 1: VirusTotal scan results for the compromised URL_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2: zscaler scan results for the compromised URL_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3: Symantec scan results for the compromised URL_\n\nOur earliest detection of Scanbox on this Pakistani government site was on March 2nd,\n2019 and though we can’t say for sure how long before that Scanbox has been gathering\ninformation, we know with certainty that on that day alone Scanbox managed to collect\ninformation on at least 70 unique site visitors, about a third of them with recorded\ncredentials.\n\n_Figure 4: Geo-location distribution of known victims_\n\nShortly after we began our deeper investigation the Scanbox server mysteriously stopped\nresponding, but a VT scan from the time when it was still active shows low detection rates\nfor this server as well:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5: VirusTotal scan results for the Scanbox server_\n\nWe contacted the Pakistani government site regarding this infection, but as of the time of\npublishing this blog post have received no response and the site remains compromised. As\nmentioned above, the Scanbox server currently appears inactive, but the infection indicates\nthat the attack has some level of access to the site, and so it’s likely that the server could\nreturn to activity or be replaced with a different piece of malicious code at the attacker’s will.\n\nThese recent cases raise concerns regarding the security of government sites, especially\nones where services provided online may involve access to sensitive information. From the\nperspective of an APT, a tool like Scanbox would only be the beginning of a potentially more\nelaborate attack.\n\nTrustwave SWG customers are and have been, protected against the Scanbox Framework\nsince 2014 when it first appeared.\n\n\n-----",
