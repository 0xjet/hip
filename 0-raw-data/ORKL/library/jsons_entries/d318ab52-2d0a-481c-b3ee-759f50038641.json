Randstad employs over 38,000 people\nand generated €23.7 billion in revenue for 2019.\n\nThis week, the Egregor ransomware operation published what they claim is 1% of\nRandstad's data stolen during a recent cyberattack. This leaked data is a 32.7MB archive\ncontaining 184 files, including accounting spreadsheets, financial reports, legal documents,\nand other miscellaneous business documents.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Egregor ransomware data leak site**\nAfter the threat actors published their data, Randstad issued a security notification\nconfirming that the Egregor ransomware operation attacked them.\n\nRandstad states that only a limited number of servers were impacted and that their network\nand business operations continued to operate without disruption.\n\nThe company confirmed that data was stolen but is still investigating whether the personal\ndata of clients of employees was accessed. At this time, they believe that only data related\nto their operations in the US, Poland, Italy, and France was stolen.\n\n\"To date, our investigation has revealed that the Egregor group obtained unauthorized and\nunlawful access to our global IT environment and to certain data, in particular related to our\n[operations in the US, Poland, Italy and France,\" Randstad disclosed. \"They have now](https://tools.euroland.com/tools/pressreleases/GetPressRelease/?ID=3845464&lang=en-GB&companycode=NL-RAND&pid=2)\npublished what is claimed to be a subset of that data. The investigation is ongoing to\nidentify what data has been accessed, including personal data, so that we can take\nappropriate action with regard to identifying and notifying relevant parties,\"\n\nThe Egregor ransomware operation has been extremely active over the past week, with\n[successful attacks against Metro Vancouver's transit system TransLink and the](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/metro-vancouvers-transit-system-hit-by-egregor-ransomware/) big-box\ndepartment store Kmart.\n\nEgregor is a new organized cybercrime ransomware-as-a-service operation that partners\nwith affiliates to compromise networks and deploy their ransomware. As part of this\narrangement, affiliates earn 70% of any ransom payments they bring in, and the Egregor\noperators make a 30% revenue share.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe ransomware gang began operating in the middle of September 2020 after a prominent\n[ransomware group known as Maze shut down their operation. Threat actors told](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/maze-ransomware-shuts-down-operations-denies-creating-cartel/)\nBleepingComputer that many of the affiliates that worked with Maze switched to Egregor,\nwhich allowed the new operation to ramp up their attacks quickly.\n\n[Other high-profile Egregor attacks include Cencosud,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/retail-giant-cencosud-hit-by-egregor-ransomware-attack-stores-impacted/) [Crytek,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/crytek-hit-by-egregor-ransomware-ubisoft-data-leaked/) [Ubisoft, and](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/crytek-hit-by-egregor-ransomware-ubisoft-data-leaked/) Barnes and\nNoble.\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n[Industrial Spy data extortion market gets into the ransomware game](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/industrial-spy-data-extortion-market-gets-into-the-ransomware-game/)\n\n[Costa Rica declares national emergency after Conti ransomware attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/costa-rica-declares-national-emergency-after-conti-ransomware-attacks/)\n\n[Quantum ransomware seen deployed in rapid network attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/quantum-ransomware-seen-deployed-in-rapid-network-attacks/)\n\n[New Black Basta ransomware springs into action with a dozen breaches](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-black-basta-ransomware-springs-into-action-with-a-dozen-breaches/)\n\n[American Dental Association hit by new Black Basta ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/american-dental-association-hit-by-new-black-basta-ransomware/)\n\n[Cyberattack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/cyberattack/)\n[Data Exfiltration](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/data-exfiltration/)\n[Egregor](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/egregor/)\n[Randstad](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/randstad/)\n[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ransomware/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
