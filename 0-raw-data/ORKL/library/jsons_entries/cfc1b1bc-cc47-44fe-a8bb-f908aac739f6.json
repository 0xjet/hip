The relevant evidence to China Panda hacker group**\n\n**Smanager_ssl.dll was built with Visual Studio (VS) 2015, build timestamp: Sunday,**\n26.04.2020 15:11:24 UTC, which was 04/26/2020 - 10:11:24 PM Vietnam time (GMT +7).\nLinker version 14.00 is from VS 2015 and after that, VS 2017, 2019,… still remains 14.xx.\n\n_Figure 1. Linker information_\n\nInformation about PE RichID of Smanager_ssl.dll:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2. PE RichID information_\n\nBased on PE RichID and VS version, our Threat Intelligence Platform for malware detected a\nsubset of a sample set with the same PE RichID and VS version. This set of samples was\nalso used by a group of hackers in an APT campaign targeted a large corporation in Vietnam\nfrom the end of 2018 to the end of 2019. We collected the sample and analyzed them\nafterwards. But for some reasons, we couldn't publish the analysis.\n\nIn the subset, we paid special attention to the following samples, which are PE x64:\n\n1.  msiscsi.dll:\n\n-   MD5: F61B44ECF57EA6D0F49A7DC2C4456E89\n\n-  SHA256:\nF654E98695E642416A74AF92776A4D24DC55249CEE354D1E868D7C3ACD26030\n\n-   Build timestamp: Tuesday, 24.09.2019 01:03:41 UTC\n\n-   PDB Path: N:\\DEV\\MMPro\\x64\\Release\\8.1.pdb (8.1.dll)\n\n-   Export: ServiceMain, run as a Service Dll.\n\n2.  verifierpr.dll:\n\n-   MD5: FD35D50D1D30275DC216263B906F9F9A\n\n-   SHA256:\n9B2C8D17F4296DF83F5AE05CFA049DF2243A5303A0310C38C4C4796319A53234\n\n\n-----\n\n-   Build timestamp: Thursday, 24.01.2019 23:55:44 UTC\n\n-   PDB Path: C:\\Dev\\18M\\x64\\Release\\8.pdb (8.dll)\n\n-   Export: DllGetClassObject\n\n3.  wercplsupport.dll:\n\n-   MD5: 2644C5916A7B49FD216DA16B1F798D3A\n\n-   SHA256:\nB9E07FF5109CC340D6CB371AFD8D112EBE29BFC1E2D395A28F04761E627D0E39\n\n-   Build timestamp: Thursday, 24.01.2019 23:56:17 UTC\n\n-   PDB Path: C:\\Dev\\18M\\x64\\Release\\8.1.pdb\n\n-   Export: ServiceMain, run as a Service Dll\n\nComparison table for PE RichID of the above files and smanager_ssl.dll file:\n\n_Figure 3. Comparison table for PE RichID_\n\nFocus on the Description column, version of the components compiler/linker/... in the Visual\nStudio. For many of the samples in that sample set, we think that this hacking group has\nmany members and also has a Source Code Control server.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe C&C info is stored in .nls, impersonating the main Windows .nls files, in the\n**Windows\\System32 folder. NLS file is** [National Language Support files.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/intl/nls-terminology)\n\nWe decoded some of the C&C as follow:\n\n_Figure 4. C&Cs information_\n\nWith smanager_ssl.dll and almost all of the samples we have collected, we noticed that the\nhacker changed the default calling convention of the VC ++ compiler in the VS IDE (or\n_command line) to_ **[__fastcall. This made for difficult analyzing, recreate the source code of](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/fastcall?view=msvc-160)**\nthe malware, give the correct definition of the function protytype.\n\nAs mentioned in previous part, Smanager_ssl.dll is registered by eToken.exe (VVSup.exe)\nand run as a Service Dll. We compare the ServiceMain function (which is required of a\n_Service Dll) and find almost the same code and coding style. We speculate that the code for_\nService is a file and is generally used for many samples. The ServiceMain function is always\nresponsible for calling the main function, which is the function that performs the main tasks of\nmalware.\n\nThe ServiceMain function of smanager_ssl.dll:\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5. ServiceMain function of smanager_ssl.dll_\n\n**wercplsupport.dll’s ServiceMain:**\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6. ServiceMain function of wercplsupport.dll_\n\nNot only the code is identical, there’s also another special point, a global variable that we\nnamed g_dwServiceState in our pseudocode. We will see this variable in the\n**SvcCtrlHandler callback function.**\n\n**SvcCtrlHandler function of smanager_ssl.dll:**\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7. SvcCtrlHandler function of smanager_ssl.dll_\n\n**wercplsupport.dll’s SvcCtrlHandler:**\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8. SvcCtrlHandler function of wercplsupport.dll_\n\nIf we conclude based on the above evidences only, it still be uncertain, as you know hackers\noften share malwares source code with each other. However, we have discovered one\nparticular feature that hackers themselves may have overlooked and missed when building\nthese malwares.\n\nSince Visual Studio 2005, Microsoft has included .h and .lib files for Telemetry feature, and\nhas been supporting gradually since Windows Vista. During build application, Telemetry\nfeature will be added default in the binary. If we want to disable it, we have to link it with\n**notelemetry.obj. The Microsoft’s Telemetry.cpp file is not included in the Visual Studio**\n2015. You can find notelemetry.cpp file in the new Windows SDKs later.\n\nThe code of notelemetry.cpp is to NULL sub the VC CRTL functions for Telemetry.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 9. notelemetry.cpp to NULL sub the VC CRTL functions for Telemetry_\n\nDuring the analysis, we discovered that in addition to smanager_ssl.dll, two samples in the\nabove subsamples were linked to Telemetry VC CRTL: verifierpr.dll and wercplsupport.dll.\n\n_Figure 10. Other samples linked to Telemetry VC CRTL_\n\n**__telemetry_mai_invoke_trigger will be called before DllMain or WinMain/main function.**\nAnd __telemetry_main_return_trigger will be called as soon as our above functions exit.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 11. __telemetry_mai_invoke_trigger will be called before DllMain or_\n\n**_WinMain/main function_**\n\nThe Telemetry API is provided by Microsoft in the TraceLoggingProvider.h file of the newer\nWindows SDK distributions. Since there is no source code of telemetry.cpp, we rely on the\n**.h file above and reanalyze the VC CRTL functions for Telemetry. We have identified**\n**ProviderMetaData on smanager_ssl.dll file. And especially the providerData of both**\n**verifierpr.dll and wercplsupport.dll are the same. GroupGuid is a type of GUID that is**\ngenerated when an attacker uses an IDE wizard or a GuidGen.exe tool or something similar.\nGUIDs never match.\n\nWe searched this GUID: {CF4F5073 - 8289 - B347 - E0DC - E8C90476BA01} on the\nInternet and sites as below but we couldn't find any result:\n\n[The Magic Number Database](https://www.magnumdb.com/)\n[GLOBAL UUID DATABASE](https://uuid.pirate-server.com/)\n...\n\nThrough all the points we just mentioned, we conclude, the code of smanager_ssl.dll is built\non a version of Visual Studio 2015, using a source that accidentally embedded Telemetry\nfeature.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 12. smanager_ssl.dll is built on a version of Visual Studio 2015 and embedded_\n\n_Telemetry feature_\n\n[To learn more about Telemetry of VS 2015 and Windows, you can read the following links (1,](http://10.10.0.46/-%09https://sudonull.com/post/89264-Visual-Studio-2015-Standard-Library-and-Telemetry)\n[2). With the GUIDs of the eToken.exe and the providerData GUID of the three dll above, we](http://10.10.0.46/-%09https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/tracelogging/trace-logging-portal)\ncould write Yara rules as follows:\n\n1.  eToken.exe (VVSup.exe):\n\n-   GUID_1 = { 5AD5B72A - 853B - 456E – AF92 – 0F4DFF9D8BAF }\n\n**Hex string = “2A B7 D5 5A 3B 85 6E 45 AF 92 0F 4D FF 9D 8B AF”**\n\n-   GUID_2 = { 798E265A - CC96 – 4623 - BA97023B575502B8 }\n\n**Hex string = “5A 26 8E 79 96 CC 23 46 BA 97 02 3B 57 55 02 B8”**\n\n-   GUID_1 and GUID_2\n\n2.   Smanager_ssl.dll:\n\n-   Text = “Microsoft.CRTProvider”\n\n-   GUID = { CF4F5073 – 8289 - B347 – E0DC – E8C90476BA01 }\n\n**Hex string = “73 50 4F CF 89 82 47 B3 E0 DC E8 C9 04 76 BA 01”**\n\n-   Text and GUID\n\n\n-----\n\nCombining all the indicators and TTPs we ve got, we considered this was the another\ncampaign of the Chinese Panda group aimed at agencies, organizations and businesses in\nVietnam over past few years.\n\nIn the next part, we will describe in detail the C++ code of the smanager_ssl.dll that we\nanalyzed and recreated.\n\nMerry Christmas & Happy New Year!\n\n_(To be continued …)_\n\n_[Click here for Vietnamese version: Part 3](https://blog.vincss.net/2020/12/re017-3-phan-tich-ky-thuat-dong-ma-doc-moi-co-nhieu-dau-hieu-lien-quan-toi-nhom-tin-tac-Panda.html)_\n\n**Trương Quốc Ngân (aka HTC)**\n\n**Malware Analysis Expert - VinCSS (a member of Vingroup)**\n\n\n-----",
