Hornetsecurity’s Security Lab already identified new Emotet malspam campaigns in\nthe wild.\n\n## Background\n\nEmotet (also known as Heodo) was first observed in 2014. It was a banking trojan stealing\nbanking details and banking login credentials from victims. But it pivoted to a malware-as-aservice (MaaS) operation providing malware distribution services to other cybercriminals.\nToday, Emotet is probably the most prolific malware distribution operation. To this end, it\nsteals the emails of its victims and replies to the victim’s previous conversations. This is\nknown as email conversation thread hijacking.5 Hornetsecurity has written numerous\nblogposts about Emotet.2,3,4,5,6,7\n\n\nOn 2021-01-27, Europol announced that an international worldwide coordinated law\nenforcement and judicial action had disrupted the Emotet botnet, and investigators have\ntaken control of Emotet’s infrastructure. The Emotet botnet was subsequently shut down by\n\n\n-----\n\nlaw enforcement.\n\n## The comeback\n\nOn 2021-11-15, TrickBot malware was installed via malspam, downloaded, and installed the\nEmotet malware. Subsequently, the Emotet botnet was rebuilt and started to send malspam\nfrom its botnet again.\n\nThey send different malicious documents (XLSM and DOCM).\n\nIn some cases, the malicious documents were also placed in encrypted ZIP archives. The\npasswords were in plain text in the emails.\n\nAs already stated, Emotet used email conversation thread hijacking,5 meaning it steals the\nemails of its victims and then replies (often even from the victim’s account) to exiting email\nconversations quoting the previous conversation in the email. This makes victims very\nsusceptible to these Emotet emails.\n\n## Countermeasures\n\n\n-----\n\nHornetsecurity s technical defense mechanisms do not get fooled by social engineering\ntechniques such as the employed email conversation thread hijacking.\n\nHornetsecurity’s [Advanced Threat Protection combats the Emotet threat with the following](https://www.hornetsecurity.com/en/services/advanced-threat-protection/)\nfeatures:\n\nMalicious document decryption can use the password listed in the email to decrypt the\nencrypted ZIP archives.\nHornetsecurity’s ATP sandbox will detect the malicious documents (even if previously\nunknown).\n\nWith the details mentioned above, we strictly recommend our Advanced Threat Protection\nservices for adequate protection against sophisticated adversaries such as Emotet, who may\nchange their attack patterns at any given time. Signatures for known malicious Emotet\ndocuments will be added to Hornetsecurity’s [Spam and Malware Protection also to protect](https://www.hornetsecurity.com/en/services/spam-filter/)\ncustomers that do not have ATP services booked.\n\n## References\n\n Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)\n\n### URLs\n\n```\nhttps[:]//team.stagingapps[.]xyz/wp-content/aPIm2GsjA/\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\nhttps[:]//newsmag.danielolayinkas[.]com/content/nVgyRFrTE68Yd9s6/\n\n```\n\n-----",
