    "plain_text": "Rather than building custom malware, many threat actors behind targeted attacks use publicly or\n\ncommercially available remote access Trojans (RATs). This pre-built malware has all the functionality\n\nneeded to conduct cyber espionage and is controlled directly by humans, who have the ability to adapt to\n\nnetwork defenses. As a result, the threat posed by these RATs should not be underestimated.\n\nHowever, it is difficult to distinguish and correlate the activity of targeted threat actors based solely on\n\ntheir preference to use particular malware — especially, freely available malware. From an analyst’s\n\nperspective, it is unclear whether these actors choose to use this type of malware simply out of\n\nconvenience or in a deliberate effort to blend in with traditional cybercrime groups, who also use these\n\nsame tools.\n\nThere are numerous RATs available for free and for purchase in online forums, chat rooms and market\n\nplaces on the Internet. Most RATs are easy to use and thus attract novices. They are used for a variety of\n\ncriminal activity, including “sextortion”. [1] The ubiquity of these RATs makes it difficult to determine if a\n\nparticular security incident is related to a targeted threat, cybercrime or just a novice “script kiddie”\n\ncausing a nuisance.\n\nAlthough publicly available RATs are used by a variety of operators with different intents, the activity of\n\nparticular threat actors can still be tracked by clustering command and control server information as well\n\nas the information that is set by the operators in the builder. These technical indicators, combined with\n\ncontext of an incident (such as the timing, specificity and human activity) allow analysts to assess the\n\ntargeted or non-targeted nature of the threat.\n\nIn this post, we examine a publicly available RAT known as XtremeRAT. This malware has been used in\n\ntargeted attacks as well as traditional cybercrime. During our investigation we found that the majority of\n\nXtremeRAT activity is associated with spam campaigns that typically distribute Zeus variants and other\n\nbanking-focused malware. Why have these traditional cybercrime operators begun to distribute RATs?\n\nThis seems odd, considering RATs require manual labor as opposed to automated banking Trojans.\n\nBased on our observations we propose one or more of the following possible explanations:\n\n1. Smokescreen\n\nThe operations may be part of a targeted attack that seeks to disguise itself and its possible targets,\n\nby using spam services to launch the attacks.\n\n2. Less traditional tools available\n\nWith more crimeware author arrests and/or disappearance of a number of banking Trojan\n\ndevelopers cybercriminals are resorting to using RATs to manually steal data such as banking and\n\n\n-----\n\n3. Complicated defenses require more versatile tools\n\nAs many traditional banking and financial institutions have improved their security practices,\n\nperhaps attackers have had a much more difficult time developing automation in their Trojans to\n\ncover all variations of these defenses; as such, RATs provide more versatility and effectiveness, at\n\nthe expense of scalability.\n\n4. Casting a wider net\n\nAfter compromising indiscriminate targets, attackers may dig deeper into specific targets of interest\n\nand/or sell off the access rights of the victims’ systems and their data to others.\n\nThese possible explanations are not mutually exclusive. One or all of them may be factors in explaining\n\nthis observed activity.\n\n**XtremeRAT**\n\nThe XtremeRAT was developed by “xtremecoder” and has been available since at least 2010. Written in\n\nDelphi, the code of XtremeRAT is shared amongst several other Delphi RAT projects including SpyNet,\n\nCyberGate, and Cerberus. The RAT is available for free; however, the developer charges 350 Euros for the\n\nsource code. Unfortunately for xtremecoder, the source code has been leaked online. The current version\n\nis Xtreme 3.6, however, there are a variety of “private” version of this RAT available as well. As such, the\n\nofficial version of this RAT and its many variants are used by a wide variety of actors.\n\nXtremeRAT allows an attacker to:\n\nInteract with the victim via a remote shell\n\nUpload/download files\n\nInteract with the registry\n\nManipulate running processes and services\n\nCapture images of the desktop\n\nRecord from connected devices, such as a webcam or microphone\n\nMoreover, during the build process, the attacker can specify whether to include keylogging and USB\n\ninfection functions.\n\n**Extracting Intelligence**\n\nXtremeRAT contains two components: a “client” and a “server”; however, from the attacker’s perspective,\n\nthese terms have reversed meanings. Specifically, according to the author, the “server” component is the\n\nmalware that resides on victim endpoints that connect to the “client”, which is operated by the attacker\n\n\n-----\n\nterminology, we refer to the server as a backdoor on the victim and the client as a remote controller\n\noperated by the attacker.\n\nXtremeRAT backdoors maintain and reference configuration data that was chosen by the attacker at the\n\ntime they were built. This data can contain very useful hints to help group attacks and attribute them to\n\nactors, similar to what we have previously described in our Poison Ivy whitepaper. [3]\n\nSeveral versions of XtremeRAT write this configuration data to disk under\n\n%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Windows, either directly, or to a directory named after mutex configured by\n\nthe attacker. When written to disk, the data is RC4 encrypted with a key of either “CYBERGATEPASS” or\n\n“CONFIG” for the versions we have analyzed. In both cases, the key is Unicode. The config file has either a\n\n“.nfo” or “.cfg” extension depending on the version. XtremeRAT’s key scheduling algorithm (KSA)\n\nimplementation contains a bug wherein it only considers the length of the key string, not including the\n\nnull bytes between each character, as is found in these Unicode strings. As a result, it only effectively uses\n\n_the first half of the key. For example, the key “C\\x00O\\x00N\\x00F\\x00I\\x00G\\x00” is 12 bytes long,_\n\nbut the length is calculated as only being 6 bytes long. Because of this, the key that is ultimately used is\n\n“C\\x00O\\x00N\\x00”.\n\nThe configuration data includes:\n\nName of the installed backdoor file\n\nDirectory under which the backdoor file is installed\n\nWhich process it will inject into (if specified)\n\nCnC information\n\nFTP information for sending stolen keystroke data to\n\nMutex name of the master process,\n\nID and group name which are used by the actors for organizational purposes\n\nBecause the decrypted configuration data can be reliably located in memory (with only slight variations in\n\nits structure from version to version) and because not all versions of XtremeRAT will write their\n\nconfiguration data to disk, parsing memory dumps of infected systems is often the ideal method for\n\nextracting intelligence.\n\nWe are releasing python scripts we have developed to gather the configuration details for various versions\n\nof XtremeRAT from both process memory dumps and the encrypted configuration file on disk. The scripts\n\n[are available at https://github.com/fireeye/tools/tree/master/malware/Xtreme%20RAT.](https://github.com/fireeye/tools/tree/master/malware/Xtreme%20RAT)\n\nAlso included in this toolset is a script that decrypts and prints the contents of the log file created by\n\n\n-----\n\nfile and has a .dat extension. Curiously, this log file is encrypted with a simple two-byte XOR instead of\n\nRC4. Later in this blog, we will share some of the configuration details we have extracted during our\n\nsubsequent analysis.\n\n**XtremeRAT Activity**\n\nUsing telemetry from the FireEye Dynamic Threat Intelligence (DTI) cloud, we examined 165 XtremeRAT\n\nsamples from attacks that primarily hit the following sectors:\n\nEnergy, utilities, and petroleum refining\n\nFinancial Services\n\nHigh-tech\n\nThese incidents include a spectrum of attacks including targeted attacks as well as indiscriminate attacks.\n\nAmong these XtremeRAT-based attacks, we found that 4 of the 165 samples were used in targeted attacks\n\nagainst the High-Tech sector by threat actors we have called “MoleRats”. [4]\n\n**Operation Molerats**\n\nIn 2012, XtremeRAT was used against a variety of governments as well as Israeli and Palestinian targets in\n\nwhat was known as Operation Molerats (the same attackers have also used variants of the Poison Ivy\n\nRAT). [5] Upon executing one particular sample (45142b17abd8a17a5e38305b718f3415), the malware\n\nbeacons to “test.cable-modem.org” and “idf.blogsite.org”. In this particular case, the attacker used\n\nXtremeRAT 2.9 within a self-extracting archive that also presents a decoy document to the victim, where\n\nthe decoy content appears to have been copied from a website.\n\nFigure 1. Contents of SFX archive containing XtremeRAT\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2. SFX settings inside malicious archive\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 3. Decoy content presented in malicious archive\n\nFigure 4 shows the controller the attacker uses to interact with systems compromised with XtremeRAT. In\n\nthis case, it appears the actor used the ID field to record the type of attack delivered (docx) and the\n\n**Group field was used to record a “campaign code” (IDF), which helps the actor keep track of the set of**\n\nvictims that were attacked during this campaign.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4. XtremeRAT controller GUI\n\nThe attacker modified the highlighted information at build time. By default, the XtremeRAT controller\n\nsets the ID field as “Server” and Group field as “Servers”, with the default password used to authenticate,\n\nconnect, and control a compromised endpoint as “1234567890”.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 5. XtremeRAT controller connection settings\n\nIn the Figure 5, the attacker specified custom CnC servers and ports and changed the default password to\n\n“1411”. The attacker also changed the default process mutex name.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 6. XtremeRat install settings\n\nBy default, the controller assigns a process mutex name of is “–((Mutex))–” and the attackers changed it\n\nto “fdgdfdg”. These indicators along with command and control domain names and the IP addresses that\n\nthey resolve to can be used to cluster and track this activity over time.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7. Molerats cluster analysis\n\nThis is a cluster of Molerats activity. In addition to using the password “1411”, the attackers are also using\n\nthe password “12345000”. This is a simple way to track the activity of these actors by using both passive\n\nDNS data and configuration information extracted from XtremeRAT.\n\n**Spam Activity**\n\nThe vast majority of XtremeRAT activity clustered around the default password “1234567890” (116\n\nsamples). There was overlap between this large cluster and the second largest one which used the\n\npassword “123456” (12 samples). The activity in these two clusters aligns with indicators observed in\n\nSpanish language spam runs. The “123456” cluster also contains spam in the English language, leveraging\n\nthe recent tragedy in Kenya as a lure. [7]\n\n**The Uranio Cluster**\n\nIn our sample set, we have 28 malware samples that connect to a set of sequentially numbered command\n\n\n-----\n\nuranio.no-ip.biz\n\nuranio2.no-ip.biz\n\nuranio3.no-ip.biz\n\nuranio4.no-ip.biz\n\nuranio5.no-ip.biz\n\nuranio6.no-ip.biz\n\nuranio7.no-ip.biz\n\nplatino.no-ip.biz\n\nplatino-2.no-ip.biz\n\nplatino-4.no-ip.biz\n\nplatino-5.no-ip.biz\n\nplatino-8.no-ip.biz\n\nplatino-9.no-ip.biz\n\ncometa3.no-ip.biz\n\ncometa4.no-ip.biz\n\nThe malware is being spammed out and has file names such as:\n\nCertificaciones De Pagos Nominas Parafiscales jpg 125420215 58644745574455 .exe\n\nSoportes de pagos certificaciones y documentos mes mayo 30 2013\n\n567888885432235678888888123456.exe\n\nCertificaciones De Pago Y Para Fiscales.exe\n\nWe extracted the configurations for a sampling of the XtremeRAT samples we came across in this spam\n\nrun and found the following results:\n\n|MD5|ID|Group|Version|Mutex|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|a6135a6a6346a460792ce2da285778b1|ABRIL|CmetaS3|3.6 Private|C5AapWKh|\n|988babfeec5111d45d7d7eddea6daf28|ABRIL|CmetaS3|3.6 Private|C5AapWKh|\n|715f54a077802a0d67e6e7136bcbe340|ABRIL|CmetaS3|3.6 Private|C5AapWKh|\n|167496763aa8d369ff482c4e2ca3da7d|ABRIL|CmetaS3|3.6 Private|C5AapWKh|\n|3f288dfa95d90a3cb4503dc5f3d49c16|Server|Cometa4|3.6 Private|4QtgfoP|\n|6a8057322e62c569924ea034508068c9|Server|Platino4|3.6 Private|mbojnXS|\n\n\n**37b90673aa83d177767d6289c4b90468 Server Platino4** 3.6\nPrivate\n\n\nmbojnXS\n\n\n-----\n\n**5a9547b727f0b4baf9b379328c797005** Server Platino8 3.6\nPrivate\n\n\nG7fjZQYAH\n\n|fb98c8406e316efb0f46024f7c6a6739|Server|Platino9|3.6 Private|kUHwdc8Y|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|64f6f819a029956b8aeafb729512b460|Server|Uranio|3.6 Private|eYwJ6QX0i|\n|a4c47256a7159f9556375c603647f4c2|Mayo|Uranio2011|3.6 Private|0pg6ooH|\n|62d6e190dcc23e838e11f449c8f9b723|Mayo|Uranio2011|3.6 Private|0pg6ooH|\n|d5d99497ebb72f574c9429ecd388a019|Mayo|Uranio2011|3.6|0pg6ooH|\n||||Private||\n|3a9237deaf25851f2511e355f8c506d7|Server|Uranio3|1.3.6.16|QwcgY0a|\n|c5e95336d52f94772cbdb2a37cef1d33|Server|Uranio3|1.3.6.16|QwcgY0a|\n|0ea60a5d4c8c629c98726cd3985b63c8|Server|Uranio4|1.3.6.16|xjUfrQHP6Xy|\n|41889ca19c18ac59d227590eeb1da214|Server|Uranio4|1.3.6.16|xjUfrQHP6Xy|\n|90e11bdbc380c88244bb0152f1142aff|Server|Uranio4|1.3.6.16|xjUfrQHP6Xy|\n|c1ad4445f1064195de1d6756950e2ae9|Server|Uranio5|3.6 Private|R9lmAhUK|\n|e5b781ec77472d8d4b3b4a4d2faf5761|Server|Uranio6|3.6 Private|KdXTsbjJ6|\n|a921aa35deedf09fabee767824fd8f7e|Server|Uranio6|3.6 Private|KdXTsbjJ6|\n|9a2e510de8a515c9b73efdf3b141f6c2|CC|Uranio7|3.6 Private|UBt3eQq0|\n|a6b862f636f625af2abcf5d2edb8aca2|CC|Uranio7|3.6 Private|iodjmGyP3|\n|0327859be30fe6a559f28af0f4f603fe|CC|Uranio7|3.6 Private|UBt3eQq0|\n\n\n“Server”, “Servers”, and “–((Mutex))–” are the defaults in the XtremeRAT controller for ID, Group, and\n\nMutex respectively. The random mutex names in the table above can be generated by double-clicking in\n\nthe Mutex field within the controller. In most cases, the number at the end of the group label is the same\n\nnumber used at the end of the subdomain for the CnC. In the case of “Uranio2011”, the subdomain is\n\nsimply “uranio” and 2011 represents the port number used to communicate with the CnC infrastructure.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8. Portugese version of XtremeRAT controller\n\n**Uranio Sinkhole Analysis**\n\nWe sinkholed uranio2.no-ip.biz between November 22, 2013 and January 6, 2014. During that time,\n\n12000 unique IPs connected to the uranio2.no-ip.biz. Recall, that this number reflects only one of many\n\ncommand and control servers. [8]\n\nHowever, estimating the number of victims this way is difficult due to DHCP lease times, which inflate the\n\nnumbers, and NAT connections, which deflate the numbers. [9] As such, we counted the unique IP\n\naddresses that connected to the sinkhole on each day. The highest number of connections to this sinkhole\n\nwas on Dec. 3, 2013 with 2003 connections and the lowest was Jan. 6, 2014 with 109 connections. The\n\naverage number of unique IP addresses that connected to the sinkhole per day was 657.\n\nWhile these IP addresses were in ranges assigned to 40 distinct countries, the vast majority of the\n\nconnections to the sinkhole (92.7 percent) were from Colombia. Argentina was a distant second with 1.22\n\npercent, followed by Venezuela with 1.02 percent, Egypt with 0.95 percent and the U.S. with 0.9 percent.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nDetermining the activity of targeted threat actors is difficult. Most of the activity associated with publicly\n\n\n-----\n\ndistribution. However, useful indicators can be extracted from these ubiquitous RATs to track the\n\nactivities of targeted threat actors (as well as cybercrime).\n\n**Tools**\n\n[https://github.com/fireeye/tools/tree/master/malware/Xtreme%20RAT](https://github.com/fireeye/tools/tree/master/malware/Xtreme%20RAT)\n\n**Notes:**\n\n1. http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/09/miss-teen-usas-webcam-spy-called-himself\ncutefuzzypuppy/ http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2011/09/how-an-omniscient-internet-sextortionist\nruined-lives/\n\n2.
