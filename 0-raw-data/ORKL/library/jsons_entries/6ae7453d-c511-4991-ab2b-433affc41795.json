Schwartz (euroinfosec) • May 16, 2016](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/authors/mathew-j-schwartz-i-892)\n\nA Vietnamese bank says it foiled a plot to transfer $1.36 million out of its accounts - via the\ninterbank SWIFT messaging system - in the fourth quarter of 2015 as part of a suspected\n[malware attack launched by fraudsters (see SWIFT Warns Banks: Coordinated Malware](https://www.databreachtoday.com/anti-malware-c-309)\n_Attacks Underway)._\n\n**See Also:** [The Power and Scale of XDR](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/power-scale-xdr-a-18876)\n\nTien Phong Commercial Joint Stock Bank, based in Hanoi, on May 15 said in a statement to\n_[Reuters that it detected the suspicious transfer requests quickly enough to contact receiving](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/16/vietnamese-bank-foils-1m-cyber-heist)_\nbanks and put a stop to the transfers. The attempted attack \"did not cause any losses,\"\nTPBank's statement reportedly said. \"It had no impact on the SWIFT system in particular and\nthe transaction system between the bank and customers in general.\"\n\n\n-----\n\nSWIFT, which stands for the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication,\nis a Brussels-based cooperative, owned by 3,000 banks, that was founded in 1973, and\nwhich maintains a messaging system used by 11,000 banks.\n\nThe State Bank of Vietnam - the country's central bank - is probing the attack after having\nreceived related information from TPBank on May 16, spokeswoman Le Thi Thuy Sen tells\n_[Bloomberg.](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-05-16/vietnam-s-central-bank-probes-hacking-attempt-at-tien-phong-bank)_\n\nTPBank and the State Bank of Vietnam couldn't be immediately reached for comment on\nthose reports.\n\n[SWIFT declined to comment on those reports, except to point to a May 13 security alert that](https://www.swift.com/insights/press-releases/swift-customer-communication_customer-security-issues)\nit sent to its customers, warning them of \"a highly adaptive campaign targeting banks'\npayment endpoints.\" That warning said an unnamed Vietnamese bank had also been\ntargeted by the same attackers who attempted to transfer $1 billion out of the central bank of\nBangladesh's account at the Federal Reserve of New York.\n\nIn the Bangladesh Bank case, the attackers successfully transferred $100 million to overseas\naccounts, of which [$81 million is still missing. Investigators say the stolen funds were](https://www.databreachtoday.com/bangladesh-bank-hackers-steal-100-million-a-8958)\nlaundered via casinos in the Philippines. SWIFT says the attack was carried out in part after\nattackers [used malware to infect a PDF reader used by bank employees.](https://www.databreachtoday.com/blogs/seeking-swift-malware-attack-antidote-p-2119)\n\n## TPBank Blames Third-Party Vendor\n\nTPBank's statement said the fraudulent transfer requests were made using an unnamed\nthird-party vendor with which the bank had contracted, to allow it to interface with the SWIFT\nnetwork. The bank said that in the wake of the fraudulent transfer requests, it stopped\nworking with the third-party provider and now has a more secure system which directly\ninterfaces with the SWIFT platform.\n\nTPBank told Reuters that the attack against it might have been carried out using the\nTrojanized PDF reader detailed in SWIFT's customer alert.\n\n## SWIFT: 'Small Number' of Similar Cases\n\nIn its May 13 customer alert, SWIFT warned that beyond Bangladesh Bank, it was aware of\na \"small number\" of similar cases at other banks, involving attackers successfully infecting\nan unnamed PDF reader used at victim banks, which could be used to alter statements and\ndisguise fraudulent transfers. Its alert did not name TPBank.\n\n[British defense contractor BAE Systems on May 13 released research saying that \"a](http://baesystemsai.blogspot.co.uk/2016/05/cyber-heist-attribution.html)\ncommercial bank in Vietnam ... also appears to have been targeted in a similar fashion using\ntailored malware, but based off a common code base\" (see Bangladesh Bank Attackers\n_Hacked SWIFT Software)._\n\n\n-----\n\nThreat-intelligence firm iSight Partners says there is at least one more victim that has not yet\nbeen publicly disclosed. \"We believe that at least three financial institutions in the region\nwere affected by these actors, and in two instances, malware was deployed that had\nfunctionality specifically associated with SWIFT fraud,\" the firm says in a research note that\nalso names the PDF reader targeted by attackers.\n\n\"The malware used to target the Vietnamese bank replaces Foxit's popular PDF reader\nsoftware to mask records of SWIFT transactions when read,\" iSight Partners says. \"When\nreports are read through the PDF reader, SWIFT records are altered to remove traces of\nfraudulent transactions.\"\n\n## The Lazarus Group Connection\n\n[Based on its digital forensic investigation, BAE Systems said the malware appeared to be](https://www.databreachtoday.com/forensics-c-315)\ntied to the Lazarus Group, as detailed in a February report into Operation Blockbuster that\nwas coordinated by anti-fraud and analytics firm Novetta. BAE Systems said the group also\n[appeared to use a code compiler named Kordllbot, and to have focused its attacks on](http://baesystemsai.blogspot.co.uk/2016/05/cyber-heist-attribution.html)\norganizations in South Korea and the United States.\n\nThe Novetta report said the Lazarus Group \"has been active since at least 2009, and\npotentially as early as 2007, and was responsible for the November 2014 destructive wiper\nattack against Sony Pictures Entertainment.\"\n\nBAE Systems said that it did not have enough evidence to incontrovertibly attribute the\nBangladesh and Vietnamese bank hacks to the same group that hacked Sony. But it said\ncurrently available evidence strongly suggests a connection. \"We believe that the same\ncoder is central to these attacks,\" it said. \"Who the coder is, who they work for, and what\ntheir motivation is for conducting these attacks cannot be determined from the digital\nevidence alone.\"\n\n## Who's Responsible for Securing SWIFT?\n\nThe bank hacking campaign has revealed uneven information security practices at some\nSWIFT-using banks. In the wake of the February theft from Bangladesh Bank, which came to\nlight in March, bank officials publicly said the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and SWIFT\nwere at least partially to blame. But the New York Fed fired back, saying that it had honored\nvalid SWIFT requests, and SWIFT said that the attackers had been able to gain access to\nBangladesh Bank's back-end systems and submit what appeared to be legitimate SWIFT\nmessages.\n\nA subsequent Bangladesh police investigation reportedly concluded that a SWIFT technician\n[left exploitable loopholes after connecting the bank to SWIFT's network, to facilitate real-time](https://www.databreachtoday.com/swift-to-banks-get-your-security-act-together-a-9099)\npayments. But other reports suggested that the bank lacked robust passwords and\n\n\n-----\n\nauthentication controls, or even firewalls (see _SWIFT to Banks: Get Your Security Act_\n_Together)._\n\nOn May 10, representatives from SWIFT, Bangladesh Bank and New York Fed met to\ndiscuss the attack and related investigations, and issued a joint statement pledging greater\ncooperation.\n\nSWIFT has also continued to urge all customers to conduct a top-to-bottom review of their\nsecurity defenses. \"Please remember that as a SWIFT user you are responsible for the\nsecurity of your own systems interfacing with the SWIFT network and your related\nenvironment - starting with basic password protection practices - in much the same way as\nyou are responsible for your other security considerations,\" its May 13 security alert reads.\n\"Whilst we issue, and have recently reminded you about, security best practice\nrecommendations, these are just a baseline and general advice.\"\n\n\n-----",
