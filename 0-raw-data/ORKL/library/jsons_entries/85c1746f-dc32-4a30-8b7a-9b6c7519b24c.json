Some of the group’s activities have been previously](https://github.com/malware-kitten/securitykitten.github.io/blob/master/_posts/2014-11-25-curious-korlia.md)\ndescribed in public by multiple sources. We have been investigating and privately reporting\non this group’s activity for years as well. Historically, their activity has been focused on\nmilitary, diplomatic and infrastructure targets in Asia and Eastern Europe.\n\nThis is also true of the group’s latest activities.\n\nA new CactusPete campaign, spotted at the end of February 2020 by Kaspersky, shows that\nthe group’s favored types of target remain the same. The victims of the new variant of the\nBisonal backdoor, according to our telemetry, were from financial and military sectors located\nin Eastern Europe. Our research started from only one sample, but by using the Kaspersky\nThreat Attribution Engine (KTAE) we found 300+ almost identical samples All of them\n\n\n-----\n\nappeared between March 2019 and April 2020. This underlines the speed of CactusPete s\ndevelopment – more than 20 samples per month. The target location forced the group to use\na hardcoded Cyrillic codepage during string manipulations. This is important, for example,\nduring remote shell functionality, to correctly handle the Cyrillic output from executed\ncommands.\n\nThe method of malware distribution for the new campaign remains unknown, but previous\ncampaigns indicate that it’s their usual way of distributing malware. The attackers’ preferred\nway to deliver malware is spear-phishing messages with “magic” attachments. The\nattachments never contain zero-day exploits, but they do include recently discovered and\npatched vulnerabilities, or any other crafty approaches that might help them deliver the\npayload. Running these attachments leads to infection.\n\nOnce the malware starts it tries to reach a hardcoded C2. The communication takes place\nusing the unmodified HTTP-based protocol, the request and response body are RC4encrypted, and the encryption key is also hardcoded into the sample. As the result of the\nRC4 encryption may contain binary data, the malware additionally encodes it in BASE64, to\nmatch the HTTP specification.\n\n1 http://C2_DOMAIN_IP/chapter1/user.html/BASE64_RC4_ENCRYPTED_BODY\n\nThe handshake consists of several steps: initial request, victim network details and a more\ndetailed victim information request. This is the complete list of victim specific information that\nis sent to the C2 during the handshake steps:\n\nHostname, IP and MAC address;\nWindows version;\nTime set on infected host;\nFlags that indicates if the malware was executed on VMware environment;\nProxy usage flag;\nSystem default CodePage Identifier;\n\nAfter the handshake has been completed, the backdoor waits for a command, periodically\npinging the C2 server. The response body from the C2 ping might hold the command and\nparameters (optionally). The updated Bisonal backdoor version maintains functionality similar\nto past backdoors built from the same codebase:\n\nExecute a remote shell;\nSilently start a program on a victim host;\nRetrieve a list of processes from the victim host;\nTerminate any process;\nUpload/Download/Delete files to/from victim host;\nRetrieve a list of available drives from the victim host;\n\n\n-----\n\nRetrieve a filelist of a specified folder from the victim host;\n\nThis is what it looks like in code.\n\n**Screenshot of the C2 command handling subroutine**\n\nThis set of remote commands helps the attackers study the victim environment for lateral\nmovement and deeper access to the target organization. The group continues to push\nvarious custom Mimikatz variants and keyloggers for credential harvesting purposes, along\nwith privilege escalation malware.\n\n## What are they looking for?\n\nSince the malware contains mostly information gathering functionality, most likely they hack\ninto organizations to gain access to the victims’ sensitive data. If we recall that CactusPete\ntargets military, diplomatic and infrastructure organizations, the information could be very\nsensitive indeed.\n\nWe would suggest the following countermeasures to prevent such threats:\n\nNetwork monitoring, including unusual behavior detection;\nUp-to-date software to prevent exploitation of vulnerabilities;\nUp-to-date antivirus solutions;\nTraining employees to recognize email-based (social engineering) attacks;\n\n## CactusPete activity\n\nCactusPete is a Chinese-speaking cyber-espionage APT group that uses medium-level\ntechnical capabilities, and the people behind it have upped their game. They appear to have\n[received support and have access to more complex code like ShadowPad, which](https://securelist.com/shadowpad-in-corporate-networks/81432/)\nCactusPete deployed in 2020. The group’s activity has been recorded since at least 2013,\n[although Korean public resources mark an even earlier date – 2009. Historically, CactusPete](https://image.ahnlab.com/file_upload/asecissue_files/ASEC_REPORT_vol.88.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\ntargets organizations within a limited range of countries – South Korea, Japan, the US and\nTaiwan. Last year’s campaigns show that the group has shifted towards other Asian and\nEastern European organizations.\n\nHere’s an overview of CactusPete activity in recent years, based on Kaspersky research\nresults:\n\nMay 2018: a new wave of targeted attacks abusing CVE-2018-8174 (this exploit has\n[been associated with the DarkHotel APT group, as described on Securelist), with](https://securelist.com/root-cause-analysis-of-cve-2018-8174/85486/)\ndiplomatic, defense, manufacturing, military and government targets in Asia and\nEastern Europe;\nDecember 2018 and early 2019: Bisonal backdoor modification with a set of spying\npayloads in a campaign targeting organizations within mining, defense, government\nand technology research targets in Eastern Europe and Asia;\nSeptember and October 2019: a DoubleT backdoor campaign, targeting military-related\nand unknown victims;\nMarch 2019 to April 2020: Bisonal backdoor modification in a campaign targeting\norganizations in financial and military institutions in Eastern Europe;\nDecember 2019 to April 2020: a modified DoubleT backdoor campaign, targeting\ntelecom and governmental organizations and other victims in Asia and Eastern Europe;\nLate 2019 and 2020: CactusPete started to deploy ShadowPad malware with victims\nincluding government organizations, energy, mining, and defense bodies and telcoms\nlocated in Asia and Eastern Europe;\n\n**Known alternative names for this APT group:**\nCactusPete, Karma Panda, Tonto Team\n\n**Known alternative names for the different payloads used:**\nBisonal, Curious Korlia, DoubleT, DOUBLEPIPE, CALMTHORNE\n\n## In the end…\n\nWe call CatusPete an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group, but the Bisonal code we\nanalyzed is not that advanced. Yet, interestingly, the CactusPete APT group has had\nsuccess without advanced techniques, using plain code without complicated obfuscation and\nspear-phishing messages with “magic” attachments as the preferred method of distribution.\nOf course, the group does continuously modify the payload code, studies the suggested\nvictim in order to craft a trustworthy phishing email, sends it to an existing email address in\nthe targeted company and makes use of new vulnerabilities and other methods to\ninconspicuously deliver the payload once an attachment has been opened. The infection\noccurs, not because of advanced technologies used during the attack, but because of those\nwho view the phishing emails and open the attachments. Companies need to conduct spearphishing awareness training for employees in order to improve their computer security\nknowledge.\n\n\n-----\n\n## IoCs\n\nPDB path:\nE:\\vs2010\\new big!\\MyServe\\Debug\\MyServe.pdb\n\nMD5:\n[A3F6818CE791A836F54708F5FB9935F3](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/A3F6818CE791A836F54708F5FB9935F3/)\n[3E431E5CF4DA9CAE83C467BC1AE818A0](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/3E431E5CF4DA9CAE83C467BC1AE818A0/)\n[11B8016045A861BE0518C9C398A79573](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/11B8016045A861BE0518C9C398A79573/)\n\nRelated material:\n\nJanuary 29, 2020\n[https://nao-sec.org/2020/01/an-overhead-view-of-the-royal-road.html](https://nao-sec.org/2020/01/an-overhead-view-of-the-royal-road.html)\nMarch 5, 2020\n[https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2020/03/bisonal-10-years-of-play.html](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2020/03/bisonal-10-years-of-play.html)\n2019\nhttps://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/summit/cds2019/presentations/cds19-executive-s08-achievement-unlocked.pdf\nJuly 31, 2018\nhttps://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-bisonal-malware-used-attacks-russia-southkorea/\n2017\n[https://image.ahnlab.com/file_upload/asecissue_files/ASEC_REPORT_vol.88.pdf](https://image.ahnlab.com/file_upload/asecissue_files/ASEC_REPORT_vol.88.pdf)\n(Korean language)\n2014\n[https://securitykitten.github.io/2014/11/25/curious-korlia.html](https://github.com/malware-kitten/securitykitten.github.io/blob/master/_posts/2014-11-25-curious-korlia.md)\n2013\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20130920120931/https://www.rsaconference.com/writable/\npresentations/file_upload/cle-t04_final_v1.pdf\n\n[Backdoor](https://securelist.com/tag/backdoor/)\n[Data theft](https://securelist.com/tag/data-theft/)\n[Malware Descriptions](https://securelist.com/tag/malware-descriptions/)\n[Malware Technologies](https://securelist.com/tag/malware-technologies/)\n[Spear phishing](https://securelist.com/tag/spear-phishing/)\n[Targeted attacks](https://securelist.com/tag/targeted-attacks/)\n\nAuthors\n\n\n-----\n\n[Konstantin Zykov](https://securelist.com/author/konstantinzykov/)\n\nCactusPete APT group’s updated Bisonal backdoor\n\nYour email address will not be published.
