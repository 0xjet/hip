However, [screenshots from Uber's slack](https://twitter.com/vxunderground/status/1570597582417821703)\nindicate that these announcements were first met with memes and jokes as employees had\nnot realized an actual cyberattack was taking place.\n\nUber has since confirmed the attack, tweeting that they are in touch with law enforcement\nand will post additional information as it becomes available.\n\n\"We are currently responding to a cybersecurity incident. We are in touch with law\n[enforcement and will post additional updates here as they become available,\" tweeted the](http://twitter.com/Uber_Comms/status/1570584747071639552?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\nUber Communications account.\n\n[The New York Times, which first reported on the breach, said they spoke to the threat actor,](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/15/technology/uber-hacking-breach.html)\nwho said they breached Uber after performing a social engineering attack on an employee\nand stealing their password.\n\nThe threat actor then gained access to the company's internal systems using the stolen\ncredentials.\n\n[On Friday afternoon, Uber posted an additional update stating that the investigation is still](https://www.uber.com/newsroom/security-update/)\nongoing but could sharing these additional details:\n\nWe have no evidence that the incident involved access to sensitive user data\n(like trip history).\nAll of our services including Uber, Uber Eats, Uber Freight, and the Uber Driver\napp are operational.\nAs we shared yesterday, we have notified law enforcement.\nInternal software tools that we took down as a precaution yesterday are coming\nback online this morning.\n\n## More details emerge\n\nAfter the attacker loudly announced that they breached Uber's systems on the company's\nSlack server and in comments to submission on the HackerOne bug bounty program,\nsecurity researchers reached out to the threat actor to learn more about the attack.\n\nIn [a conversation between the threat actor and security researcher Corben Leo, the hacker](https://twitter.com/hacker_/status/1570582547415068672)\nsaid they were able to gain access to Uber's Intranet after conducting a social engineering\nattack on an employee.\n\nAccording to the threat actor, they attempted to log in as an Uber employee but did not\nprovide details on how they gained access to the credentials.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs the Uber account was protected with multi-factor authentication, the attacker allegedly\nused an MFA Fatigue attack and pretended to be Uber IT support to convince the employee\nto accept the MFA request.\n\n**Hackers claim to have used an MFA Fatigue attack**\n\n_Source:_ _[Kevin Beaumont](https://twitter.com/GossiTheDog/status/1570717994397073410)_\nMFA Fatigue attacks are when a threat actor has access to corporate login credentials but\nis blocked from access to the account by multi-factor authentication. They then issue\nrepeated MFA requests to the target until the victims become tired of seeing them and\nfinally accept the notification.\n\nThis social engineering tactic has become very popular in recent attacks against well-known\n[companies, including Twitter,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-stole-twitter-employee-credentials-via-phone-phishing/) [MailChimp,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-breach-mailchimps-internal-tools-to-target-crypto-customers/) [Robinhood, and](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/7-million-robinhood-user-email-addresses-for-sale-on-hacker-forum/) [Okta.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/okta-investigating-claims-of-customer-data-breach-from-lapsus-group/)\n\nAfter gaining access to the credentials, the threat actor told Leo that they logged into the\nInternal network through the corporate VPN and began scanning the company's Intranet for\nsensitive information.\n\nAs part of these scans, the hacker says they found a PowerShell script containing admin\ncredentials for the company's Thycotic privileged access management (PAM) platform,\nwhich was used to access the login secrets for the company's other internal services.\n\n\"ok so basically uber had a network share \\\\[redacted]pts. the share contained some\npowershell scripts.\n\none of the powershell scripts contained the username and password for a admin user\nin Thycotic (PAM) Using this i was able to extract secrets for all services, DA, DUO,\nOnelogin, AWS, Gsuite\"\n\nThe New York Times reports that the attacker claimed to have accessed Uber databases\nand source code as part of the attack.\n\nTo be clear, this information is from the threat actors and has not been verified by Uber,\nwhich has not responded to our requests for more information.\n\n\n-----\n\n## HackerOne vulnerability reports exposed\n\nWhile it's possible that the threat actor stole data and source code from Uber during this\nattack, they also had access to what could be an even more valuable asset.\n\n[According to Yuga Labs security engineer Sam Curry, the hacker also had access to the](http://twitter.com/samwcyo/status/1570577801790783493)\ncompany's HackerOne bug bounty program, where they commented on all of the\ncompany's bug bounty tickets.\n\n**Comment left by the hacker on HackerOne submissions**\n\n_Source: Curry_\nCurry told BleepingComputer that he first learned of the breach after the attacker left the\nabove comment on a vulnerability report he submitted to Uber two years ago.\n\nUber runs a [HackerOne bug bounty program that allows security researchers to privately](https://hackerone.com/uber/)\ndisclose vulnerabilities in their systems and apps in exchange for a monetary bug bounty\nreward. These vulnerability reports are meant to be kept confidential until a fix can be\nreleased to prevent attackers from exploiting them in attacks.\n\nCurry further shared that an Uber employee said the threat actor had access to all of the\ncompany's private vulnerability submissions on HackerOne.\n\nBleepingComputer was also told by a source that the attacker downloaded all vulnerability\nreports before they lost access to Uber's bug bounty program. This likely includes\nvulnerability reports that have not been fixed, presenting a severe security risk to Uber.\n\nHackerOne has since disabled the Uber bug bounty program, cutting off access to the\ndisclosed vulnerabilities.\n\nHowever, it would not be surprising if the threat actor had already downloaded the\nvulnerability reports and would likely sell them to other threat actors to cash out on the\nattack quickly.\n\n_Update 9/16/22:_\n\n_Added more details provided by the hacker about how the attack took place._\n\n_Added statement from Uber._\n\n\n-----\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[MFA Fatigue: Hackers’ new favorite tactic in high-profile breaches](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/mfa-fatigue-hackers-new-favorite-tactic-in-high-profile-breaches/)\n\n[Hackers steal crypto from Bitcoin ATMs by exploiting zero-day bug](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-steal-crypto-from-bitcoin-atms-by-exploiting-zero-day-bug/)\n\n[CISA adds 7 vulnerabilities to list of bugs exploited by hackers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cisa-adds-7-vulnerabilities-to-list-of-bugs-exploited-by-hackers/)\n\n[Hackers are actively exploiting password-stealing flaw in Zimbra](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-are-actively-exploiting-password-stealing-flaw-in-zimbra/)\n\n[CISA: Hackers exploit critical Bitbucket Server flaw in attacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cisa-hackers-exploit-critical-bitbucket-server-flaw-in-attacks/)\n\n[Credentials](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/credentials/)\n[Cyberattack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/cyberattack/)\n[HackerOne](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/hackerone/)\n[Social Engineering](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/social-engineering/)\n[Uber](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/uber/)\n[Vulnerability](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/vulnerability/)\n\n[Lawrence Abrams](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/)\n\nLawrence Abrams is the owner and Editor in Chief of BleepingComputer.com.
