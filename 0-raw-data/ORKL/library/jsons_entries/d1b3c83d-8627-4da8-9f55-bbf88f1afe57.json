These reports mainly center around the crypter\nthat hides the usage of commodity malicious remote access tools.\n\nWe decided this would be a good starting point to demonstrate how a researcher can pivot\nfrom the initial discovery of a RAT and eventually profile a threat actor. This post will show\nhow we discovered previous campaigns targeting the aviation industry, which links back to\nan actor that's been active for approximately six years.\n\nWe believe the actor is based out of Nigeria with a high degree of confidence and doesn't\nseem to be technically sophisticated, using off-the-shelf malware since the beginning of its\nactivities without developing its own malware. The actor also buys the crypters that allow the\nusage of such malware without being detected, throughout the years it has used several\ndifferent cryptors, mostly bought on online forums.\n\nWe also believe with a high degree of confidence that the actor has been active for at least\nfive years. For the last two, they've been targeting the aviation industry, while conducting\nother campaigns at the same time. Pivoting from an initial discovery is not an exact science\n— in this process, a researcher must assert a certain level of confidence in these\nassociations.\n\nIn this post, we will show how our research uncovered information about the attackers\n[spreading AsyncRAT and njRAT using specific lure documents centered around the aviation](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2021/08/rat-campaign-targets-latin-america.html&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1631718121355000&usg=AOvVaw3AV8Dfz3Pax0lvbxvvg111)\nindustry. If infected with these threats, organizations could fall victim to data theft, financial\nfraud or future cyber attacks with much worse consequences.\n\nIn the end, our research shows that actors that perform smaller attacks can keep doing them\nfor a long period of time under the radar. However, their activities can lead to major incidents\nat large organizations. These are the actors that feed the underground market of credentials\n[and cookies, which can then be used by larger groups on activities like \"big game hunting.\"](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2020/07/wastedlocker-emerges.html&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1631718121356000&usg=AOvVaw1Jk8ItJdYDq7LSXTiO_6Dv)\n\n## The aviation campaign\n\n[We started our research into these campaigns after a tweet from Microsoft describing new](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://twitter.com/MsftSecIntel/status/1392219314535559169&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1631718121357000&usg=AOvVaw3APxUVDQ4isB2XldxuXDCT)\nattacks they discovered using AsyncRAT. Our researchers looked at the domain Microsoft\nSecurity Intelligence mentioned, kimjoy[.]ddns[.]net. The image below shows the several\nlinks we uncovered between the campaigns, domains, IPs and actors somehow associated\nwith each other.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis shows us that the actor behind these campaigns has been operating malware for more\nthan five years and specifically targeting the aviation industry for at least two years. For this\ncampaign, the actor used emails similar to the one below as the initial attack vector.\n\nThese emails would appear to contain an attached PDF file that was a link to a .vbs file\nhosted on Google Drive.\n\n\n-----\n\nOur research shows that this actor has been targeting the aviation industry since at least\n2018, with files mentioning both \"Trip Itinerary Details\" and \"Bombardier\" at the time using\nthe URL akconsult[.]linkpc[.]net.\n\n## akconsult[.]linkpc[.]net\n\nWe first reached this domain by searching for the string \"Charter details.vbs,\" which is the\nname of one of the samples linked to the kimjoy[.]ddns[.]net domain.\n\nThe domain akconsult.linkpc.net is the oldest domain, first seen on July 2, 2015. Analysis of\nthe activity associated with the domain reveals that this actor has used several RATs and\nthat, since August 2018, there are samples communicating with this domain with names that\nindicate the adversary wanted to target the aviation industry.\n\nThe following table shows a timeline of samples with aviation-related names that\ncommunicate with akconsult[.]linkpc[.]net. It is worth noting that these are not the only files\nrelated to this domain — they are just the ones relevant to our investigation.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis actor has been active for so long we wanted to know what else we could find about\nthem. So we started a search using the \"akconsult\" keyword. This search revealed a\nmalware sample and a user handle mentioned on the site hackingforum[.]net. A search on\nthis forum turned up several indicators of the actor's goals, which we will detail in the\nfollowing sections.\n\nThe sample identified was first seen on Feb. 7, 2013 and was packed with a .NET packer\nthat performs a triple reflection of the RunPE stub, before hollowing a copy of itself to inject\nthe CyberGate malware.\n\n\n-----\n\nOne of the Cybergate RAT's configuration parameters is the NewIdentification, as can be\nseen on the registry key on the image above. We found a sample that uses Akconsult as an\nidentification key. This parameter is defined by the malware builder so that it can distinguish\nbetween several operators. In this case, the operator used the handle \"Akconsult,\" giving us\na good link to our actor. At this point, we know our actor uses akconsult as a username, so it\nwouldn't be unusual for them to use it in a sample.\n\nThe command and control (C2) domain used by this sample is \"opybiddo.zapto.org,\" which is\nmentioned in the court case \"Microsoft Corporation v. Mutairi et al.\" In this case, Microsoft\nmade a complaint against the creators of njWorm and the H-worm and VitalWerks, along\nwith the owner of the domain zapto.org. A deeper look into the case indicates that there was\nno relation between AKconsult and the worm creators. At first glance, it seems that the\ndomain was seized along with others based solely on the fact that it was distributing malware\nand belonged to VitalWerks. Eventually, we would come to find that there is another link\nbetween our actor and these worms, which further strengthens the association between the\nthreat actor and this case.\n\nThis seizure predates the first record we have for the akconsult[.]linkpc[.]net domain, and\nmay have been the reason behind the creation of akconsult at linkpc[.].net\n\nUsing this hostname as a C2, we identified four other samples all using the same malware\nbut with different identifiers between September 2012 and May 2014.\n\nDuring the recent campaigns, this domain was being used as a C2 for AsyncRAT, which the\nattackers dropped via a VBS file hosted on Google Drive. This server was using TLS to\nencrypt the C2 communications, so we decided to search for other servers using the same\ncertificate thumbprint.\n\nThis search shows AsyncRAT clients communicating with the same server that was used on\nthese campaigns. This expanded our sample scope to more than 50 samples. The analysis\nof these samples uncovered the existence of eight more domains linked to this campaign\nlisted below.\n\n\n-----\n\nMost of the domains were first seen either in May or June 2021. The oldest of the list\nseemed to be active only for a couple of days, without many samples using it. However, the\nURL e29rava[.]ddns[.]net was always active with several samples using it as C2.\n\n### e29rava[.]ddns[.]net\n\nWe analyzed several of these domains between early June and late July. Eventually, we\nfound that the domain e29rava[.]ddns[.]net is linked to at least 14 visual basic scripting (VBS)\nfiles with names that are clearly linked to the aviation industry, as can be seen below.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis domain was almost exclusively used in this campaign, some of the file names are used\npointing to other domains on the previous list around the same day.\n\nThese VBS files are a crypter that is wrapping the AsyncRAT, as previously mentioned.\n\n## Other domains\n\nFollowing the same breadcrumbs, we found other domains strongly linked to the same threat\nactor that were not related with the aviation-themed campaigns.\n\n### Hostname bodmas[.]linkpc[.]net\n\nWe discovered this domain because \"bodmas\" is one of the usernames the threat actors use\nfor the Aspire crypter. A quick search for samples associated with it showed samples that\nwere active in the last quarter of 2018. As the picture below shows, in December 2018,\nNassief had already purchased the crypter.\n\n\n-----\n\nOne of the samples we found establishes yet another link to the hostname\nkimjoy[.]ddns[.]net, which was one of the original domains reportedly linked to the aviation\ncampaigns. One sample contains the path for the PDB file shown below.\n\nThis path shows that it is using the Aspire crypter but also shows the \"kimjoy\" handle in a\nsample that contacts the bodmas[.]linkpc[.]net domain, establishing another link between the\ntwo. This seems to be some internal handle used by Aspire at build time.\n\nThe crypter was used to wrap CyberGate malware, the same we saw on the previous\ndomain.\n\n### Hostname groups[.]us[.]to\n\nSometimes during our investigations we are confronted with weak links, links that although\ntechnically they make sense, due to the lack of additional supporting links or because they\ndon't fully fit the context, making us define them as low-confidence links — this is one of\nthose examples.\n\nWhile the aviation campaign was active, there was one domain that, although it didn't seem\nrelated at first, there was an overlap between IP addresses, as shown below.\n\n\n-----\n\nAt this point, we decided that it would be worth taking a deeper look at this hostname, one\nthe actor doesn't use very often.\n\nThe oldest malware sample referring to this hostname was first seen on Sept. 24, 2016 and\nwas a simple batch file that is part of a malware chain that drops multiple files. The batch file\nwill download and execute another malware, obfuscated with a Delphi packer.\n\nTalos found what seemed like tests to determine the detection ratio of the malware using this\ndomain as a C2. The table below shows the submissions done with the same IP address\nfrom the Dominican Republic, a single time, indicating that tests were being performed.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe decided to take a deeper look at these samples since they were being tested for\ndetection.\n\n### Convoluted njRAT\n\nWhen we started the analysis on the Microsoft Publisher files and, given the previous TTPs\nfrom this actor, we were not expecting the number of layers in the infection chain.\n\nThe Publisher files all had the same origins. We found the initial macros for testing and then\nanother version that, for the untrained eye, would seem like a perfectly normal macro.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn both cases, the macro extracts data from the Microsoft Form object embedded in the\nmalicious document.\n\nThis macro downloads an HTML document from the C2 and uses the mshta, as can be seen\non the image above on the right. The second stage is an HTML page that contains a\nVBScript that the mshta executes. This code contains a PowerShell script which, after\ndeobfuscation, looks like the image below.\n\nThis script will ping us.cnn.com as an internet connection test and, afterward, it will proceed\nto download the third stage from the GitHub page hxxps://satlahlk[.]github[.]io/msc/cl.png,\nthis other stage is PowerShell, encoded byte per byte.\n\nThis PowerShell contains three different .NET-compressed assemblies that are also charencoded. The first assembly patches the AMSI to prevent malware detection. This is a\n[variation code published on GitHub, as can be seen by the bytes contained on the byte](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/rasta-mouse/AmsiScanBufferBypass/blob/main/AmsiBypass.cs&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1631718121371000&usg=AOvVaw0V8Ndqx6dLK6iJYDsNkQCQ)\narray.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe second assembly is an injector that will run the executable passed on the first parameter\nand inject the code passed on the second parameter into it.\n\nThe injected malware is a variant of njRAT. This does not imply that the actor is sophisticated\n— it simply shows that the actor uses different RATs.\n\n**H-Worm**\n\nA malicious document first seen on Dec. 13, 2019 was found downloading and executing a\npayload hosted on the same domain.\n\nThis sample was packed with a simple chr operation that contacts the domain groups[.]us.\n\n[.]to. Once unpacked, it was clear that it was H-Worm developed by an actor that uses the\nhandle \"houdini\".\n\n\n-----\n\nThese are the same two kinds of malicious applications that are listed in the aforementioned\nMicrosoft indictment.\n\n**The designer**\n\nA deeper look into the njRAT sample took us down another line of investigation. As we\nmentioned above, this sample has a very convoluted packaging, but one of the steps is to\ndownload the final stage from https://satlahlk[.]github[.]io/msc/cl.png. This GitHub account\nindicates that the owner is in Brazil, but the njRAT function names are in Spanish.\n\nWe found it unusual that the PowerShell crypter contains references to the Portuguese\nsoccer player Cristiano Ronaldo. \"Chris\" is the Brazilian and Spanish diminutive to Cristiano.\n\nA search for the GitHub account was a dead end, just like the mutex created by the rat name\n\"TikTok\". However, the njRAT variant seems to have unique details to pivot off.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the C2 communication, the RAT uses @!#& %$ as a field delimiter, as we can see on\nthe page below that string is defined as a byte array, which is converted into characters when\nit is used.\n\nOn the right side of the image, we can see the hex definition of the byte array creation\ninstead of the decompiled code. Since this is a very specific string, we decided to use it as a\npivot point. A search by the bytes \"0A800600000420391B0000800800000420011400008D\"\nrevealed three other samples, all contacting the same domain.\n\nThese samples have an additional pivoting point: They create a mutex called \"UbboSatlahlk,\"\nwhich contains part of the previously mentioned GitHub account. This mutex seems unique\nenough to warrant additional investigation. It supplies seven samples, which contain the\nsame domain — and based on the mutex, the names are clearly linked to our original\nsample.\n\nA search for that mutex on the internet revealed that it is also a username on a cybersecurity\nSpanish-speaking forum. The Spanish language is also consistent with two other indicators\n— first, the RAT functions are all written in Spanish, and the majority of IPs used by the\ndomain are located in the Dominican Republic, a country where the official language is\nSpanish.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn this message, the user says they are writing a crypter, but are having some troubles. This\nis a rather old message from 2016 just like the first appearance of the domain.\n\nFurthermore, a Skype account with the name \"UbboSatlahlk\" reports its location as being in\nSanto Domingo in the Dominican Republic, which strengthens the idea that it might be\nassociated with our designer.\n\n**Clustering paradox**\n\nThis overlap indicates that the groups.us[.]to dynamic domain may also be related to the\nsame actor. However, this could be a false link if the IP address belonged to a shared host.\nOn the other hand, if the IP address belonged to a shared host, then there should be a large\nnumber of domains resolving to this IP. In this case, there are only 13, and three of them we\ncan rule out because they are outside the time frame of the events in question. The\nremaining 10 are either dynamic DNS or VPN services that offer static IP. The VPN records\nresolution mostly originated from Nigeria, which is also consistent with our research.\n\nOn the other side, the remaining TTPs differ from the aviation campaign. The aviation\ncampaign was mainly distributed through emails containing links to the malware executable\nhosted on Google Drive, the payloads are obfuscated using crypters, but there are no\ndownloadable stages. As we have shown, the malware campaigns associated with this\ndomain are not consistent with the TTPs of the actor behind the aviation campaigns.\nHowever, we also know that this actor is not particularly technically savvy, and tend to buy\nthe tools that they use.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe most likely explanation is that this domain has been used to test new tools from a new\ndeveloper. Because there are links to this actor and they are definitively linked to malicious\nactivities, we decided to add the domains reserverem[.]duckdns[.]org and\nmonthending[.]duckdns[.]org to the list of IOCs, even though we didn't perform in-depth\nresearch around them.\n\n## Actor profiling\n\n Avatars and Pseudonyms\n\nLooking at the campaign details we discussed up to this point, we have strong indications\nthat this actor has been active at least since 2013. The malicious actor initially used the\nCyberGate malware, then moved to another off-the-shelf malware. During our research, we\nlinked the early campaigns related to akconsult to a handle — \"Nassief2018\" — on another\npopular hacking forum. The same account also mentions that it uses the usernames\n\"bodmas\" and \"kimjoy\" on other RAT platforms.\n\nDuring interactions on this forum, the user also revealed other information about himself.\nNamely, an email address — kimjoy44@yahoo[.]com — and a Telegram account —\n[@pablohop. Both accounts were linked to the aviation-themed campaigns in this post.](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://blog.morphisec.com/revealing-the-snip3-crypter-a-highly-evasive-rat-loader&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1631718121379000&usg=AOvVaw1pSWaLbZMY4eM3tc2QJVik)\n\nOn Skype, the actor's email is associated with the username \"abudulakeem123.\"\n\n## Geographic location\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile researching the actor s activities, using passive DNS telemetry, we compiled the list of\nIPs used by the domain akconsult.linkpc.net. The chart below shows that roughly 73 percent\nof the IPs were based in Nigeria, further strengthening the theory that the actor in question is\nbased in Nigeria.\n\nThe same happens, with an even higher percentage with the bodmas[.]linkpc[.]net\nhostname, but this is a more recent hostname that has pointed to fewer IP addresses.\n\n## Other sources\n\nOften while performing this kind of research, it's worth performing a simple web search using\nthe keywords obtained from other sources. While doing this, we found the tweet below made\nby [.sS.! which, on top of containing some of the information we found, also contains](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://mobile.twitter.com/sS55752750/status/1393283668962119685&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1631718121382000&usg=AOvVaw28oKghT9dP3zYkIH9BTXDC)\nadditional information about the actor.\n\n\n-----\n\nSome of this information matches what we found on our own research, others are completely\nnew and we have not been able to confirm this Twitter user's claims.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nMany actors can have limited technical knowledge but still be able to operate RATs or\ninformation-stealers, posing a significant risk to large corporations given the right conditions.\nIn this case, we have shown that what seemed like a simple campaign is, in fact, a\ncontinuous operation that has been active for three years, targeting an entire industry with\noff-the-shelf malware disguised with different crypters.\n\n\n-----\n\nThese kinds of small operations tend to fly under the radar and even after exposure the\nactors behind them wont stop their activity. They abandon the C2 hostnames — which in this\ncase are free DNS-based and they may change the crypter and initial vector, but they won't\nstop their activity. The black market for web cookies, tokens and valid credentials is way too\nvaluable when compared with the economy in their home countries for them to stop.\n\nWe also hope this illustrates how to pivot malware research based on OSINT alone.\nHowever, it is important to be careful with weak links that could lead to erroneous\nconclusions. The weak links shouldn't be discarded — they should be seen as one more\npiece of information that, together with other links, may result in a much stronger relationship\nbetween two pieces of information.\n\n## Coverage\n\nWays our customers can detect and block this threat are listed below.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Cisco Secure Endpoint (formerly AMP for Endpoints) is ideally suited to prevent the](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/amp-for-endpoints/index.html&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1631718121385000&usg=AOvVaw1DaV2BKVS_x-NBUd1si_BS)\n[execution of the malware detailed in this post.
