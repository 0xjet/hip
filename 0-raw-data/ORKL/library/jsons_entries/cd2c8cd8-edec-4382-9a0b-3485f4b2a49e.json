We have named this group FamousSparrow and we believe it has been active since at least\n2019.\n\nReviewing telemetry data during our investigation, we realized that FamousSparrow leveraged the Microsoft\n[Exchange vulnerabilities known as ProxyLogon that we described extensively in March 2021. As a reminder, this](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/03/10/exchange-servers-under-siege-10-apt-groups/)\nremote code execution vulnerability was used by more than 10 APT groups to take over Exchange mail servers\nworldwide. According to ESET telemetry, FamousSparrow started to exploit the vulnerabilities on March 3, 2021,rd\nthe day following the release of the patch, so it is yet another APT group that had access to the ProxyLogon\nremote code execution vulnerability in March 2021.\n\nIn this blogpost we will discuss the attribution to FamousSparrow and the group’s victimology. This will be followed\nby a detailed technical analysis of the group’s main backdoor that we have named SparrowDoor.\n\n## A note on attribution\n\nFamousSparrow is a group that we consider as the only current user of the custom backdoor, SparrowDoor (which\nwe cover in detail in the later sections of this blogpost). It also uses two custom versions of Mimikatz (see the\n_Indicators of Compromise section) that could be used to connect incidents to this group._\n\nWhile we consider FamousSparrow to be a separate entity, we found connections to other known APT groups. In\n[one case, attackers deployed a variant of Motnug that is a loader used by SparklingGoblin. In another case, on a](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/08/24/sidewalk-may-be-as-dangerous-as-crosswalk/)\nmachine compromised by FamousSparrow, we found a running Metasploit with cdn.kkxx888666[.]com as its C&C\n[server. This domain is related to a group known as DRBControl.](https://documents.trendmicro.com/assets/white_papers/wp-uncovering-DRBcontrol.pdf)\n\n## Victimology\n\n\n-----\n\nThe group has been active since at least August 2019 and it mainly targets hotels worldwide. In addition, we have\nseen a few targets in other sectors such as governments, international organizations, engineering companies and\nlaw firms in the following countries:\n\nBrazil\nBurkina Faso\nSouth Africa\nCanada\nIsrael\nFrance\nGuatemala\nLithuania\nSaudi Arabia\nTaiwan\nThailand\nUnited Kingdom\n\n_Figure 1. Geographic distribution of FamousSparrow targets_\n\n## Compromise vector\n\nIn a few cases, we were able to find the initial compromise vector used by FamousSparrow and these systems\nwere compromised through vulnerable internet-facing web applications. We believe FamousSparrow exploited\nknown remote code execution vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange (including ProxyLogon in March 2021),\nMicrosoft SharePoint and Oracle Opera (business software for hotel management), which were used to drop\nvarious malicious samples.\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce the server is compromised, attackers deploy several custom tools:\n\nA Mimikatz variant\nA small utility that drops [ProcDump on disk and uses it to dump the lsass process, probably in order to gather](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procdump)\nin-memory secrets, such as credentials\n[Nbtscan, a NetBIOS scanner](http://www.unixwiz.net/tools/nbtscan.html)\nA loader for the SparrowDoor backdoor\n\nThrough our telemetry, we were able to recover only the loader component (SHA-1:\nE2B0851E2E281CC7BCA3D6D9B2FA0C4B7AC5A02B). We also found a very similar loader on VirusTotal (SHA1: BB2F5B573AC7A761015DAAD0B7FF03B294DC60F6) that allowed us to find the missing components,\nincluding SparrowDoor.\n\n## SparrowDoor\n\n### Loader\n\nSparrowDoor is initially loaded via DLL search order hijacking, using three elements – a legitimate K7 Computing\nexecutable (Indexer.exe) used as the DLL hijacking host, a malicious DLL (K7UI.dll), and encrypted shellcode\n(MpSvc.dll) – all of which are dropped in %PROGRAMDATA%\\Software\\. It can be assumed that the command\nline argument used with the initial SparrowDoor execution, in order to set up persistence, is either nothing or\nanything but -i, -k or -d (the functionalities of these three arguments are explained below). Once persistence is set\nup, SparrowDoor is executed with the -i command line argument. Refer to Figure 2 for a brief overview of the flow\nof the initial loading process. If you would like an in-depth look into the loading process, continue reading!\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2. SparrowDoor staging_\n\nThe legitimate executable, Indexer.exe, requires the library K7UI.dll to operate. Therefore, the OS looks for the\nDLL file in directories in the prescribed load order. Since the directory where the Indexer.exe file is stored is at the\ntop priority in the load order, it is exposed to DLL search-order hijacking. And that is exactly how the malware gets\nloaded. Indexer.exe loads the malicious K7UI.dll, which in turn patches the code in Indexer.exe (from call WinMain\nto jmp K7UI.0x100010D0) and then returns to Indexer.exe. As a result of this, Indexer.exe ends up running a\nsubroutine in K7UI.dll (located in the .text section) instead of calling WinMain. We will refer to this subroutine as\n**launcher. The functionality of launcher is to load MpSvc.dll (the encrypted shellcode) into memory from the**\ndirectory that also stores Indexer.exe, decrypt the content and then execute the shellcode.\n\nThe shellcode (MpSvc.dll) is encrypted using four-byte XOR with the key being the first four bytes of the file.\n\nThe MpSvc.dll shellcode loads various libraries responsible for building a PE structure and locates the addresses\nof the functions to be used. After that, it allocates RWX memory and copies various locations in the shellcode into it\n(in order to build the PE structure). It also resolves the imports of several functions from different libraries. Finally, it\nexecutes the newly built backdoor PE from the entry point. Interestingly, this rebuilt executable image has no PE\nheaders, as shown in Figure 2, so the loader executes the backdoor by jumping to the entry point at a hardcoded\noffset within the allocated memory.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 3. The PE header is missing in the newly built backdoor from the MpSvc.dll shellcode_\n\n### Backdoor\n\nThe arguments passed to the backdoor are inherited from the arguments passed to Indexer.exe, or to any other\nbinary that gets the shellcode/backdoor injected. The tasks performed by the backdoor after an argument is\nspecified are shown in Table 1.\n\n_Table 1. Actions performed based on the command line arguments provided to SparrowDoor_\n\n\n-----\n\n**ArgumentArgument** **ActionAction**\n\n\nNo argument or\nnot matching\nthe following\n\n\nPersistence is set through the registry Run key and a service, which is created and started\nusing the configuration data (described in the next section) hardcoded in the binary. Finally,\nthe backdoor is restarted with the -i switch.\n\n\n-i The backdoor is restarted with the -k switch.\n\n-k The backdoor interpreter (described later) is called with a kill switch.\n\n-d The backdoor interpreter is called without a kill switch.\n\n_Note:_\n\n1. The kill switch gives the backdoor the privilege to uninstall or restart SparrowDoor.\n2. The backdoor interpreter gets called regardless of the argument used because it will always end up with a -k\n\n_or -d argument._\n\n**_Configuration data_**\n\nThe configuration is found in the binary and is decrypted using the multi-byte XOR key ^&32yUgf. The\nconfiguration has the following format:\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n\nstruct config\n\n{\n\nchar domain[64];\n\nchar user [64];\n\nchar pass[64];\n\nchar ip[64];\n\nchar port[2];\n\nchar serviceName[64];\n\nchar serviceDisplayName[128];\n\nchar serviceDescription[128];\n\n};\n\n\nThe decrypted values are shown in Table 2.\n\n_Table 2. The key-value pairs of the configuration along with a description of their purpose_\n\n**Key** **Value** **Purpose**\n\ndomain credits.offices-analytics[.]com C&C server domain\n\nuser user Proxy settings used to connect to C&C server\n\npass pass\n\nip 127.1.1.1\n\nport 8080\n\n\n-----\n\n**Key** **Value** **Purpose**\n\nserviceName WSearchIndex Information used for creating a service to set up\npersistence. Also, note that the serviceName is used\nas the value name under the Run key in the registry\n\nserviceDisplayName Windows Search Index\n\nserviceDescription Provides content indexing,\nproperty caching, and search\nresults for files, e-mail, and other\ncontent.\n\nThe connections could be either through a proxy or not, and they connect to the C&C server over port 443\n(HTTPS). So, the communication should be encrypted using TLS. During the first attempt to contact the C&C\nserver, SparrowDoor checks whether a connection can be established without using a proxy, and if it can’t, then\nthe data is sent through a proxy. All outgoing data is encrypted using the XOR key hH7@83#mi and all incoming\ndata is decrypted using the XOR key h*^4hFa. The data has a structure that starts with a Command ID, followed\nby the length of the ensuing encrypted data, followed by the encrypted data.\n\nFigure 4 shows an example of how the data is sent to the C&C server (in this case it is sending system\ninformation), while Figure 5 shows the plaintext form of the same data payload.\n\n_Figure 4. A Wireshark dump showing the data POSTed by the backdoor_\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 5. The decrypted data containing system information_\n\n**Victim’s local IP address in this case can be converted to decimal, giving 192.168.42.1.**\n\n**Session ID is the Remote Desktop Services session ID associated with the backdoor process, found using the**\n[ProcessIdToSessionId Windows API call.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-processidtosessionid)\n\nThe systemInfoHash is computed via the [sdbm hash algorithm, using the username, computer name, host](http://www.cse.yorku.ca/~oz/hash.html#sdbm)\naddresses and the session ID.\n\n**_Backdoor interpreter function_**\n\nPrivilege escalation is performed in this function by adjusting the access token of the SparrowDoor process to\nenable SeDebugPrivilege. After that, the shutdown function (Ws2_32.dll) is patched to prevent disabling sends and\nreceives on a socket and the closesocket function (Ws2_32.dll) is patched to enable the DONT_LINGER option\nfirst to close the socket without waiting for pending data to be sent or received. Finally, system information is sent\nto the C&C server (as seen in Figures 4 and 5 above) to receive data back in return.\n\nBased on the Command ID field in the data received from the C&C server, the backdoor can perform different\nmalicious actions that are detailed in Table 3.\n\n_Table 3. Actions performed by SparrowDoor when the corresponding Command IDs are received_\n\n**Command ID** **Action**\n\n0x1C615632 The current process is closed.\n\n0x1DE15F35 A child svchost.exe process is spawned with processToken information of the process (Process\nID) specified by the C&C server, with argument -d and then the shellcode is injected into the\nprocess.\n\n0x1A6B561A A directory is created using the name provided by the C&C server.\n\n0x18695638 A file is renamed. Both the file to be renamed and the new name are provided by the C&C\nserver.\n\n0x196A5629 A file is deleted, as specified in the incoming data.\n\n\n0x17685647\n\n\nIf length of the data is 1, and the data matches $, then the length of systemInfoHash along with\nan array of drive types are sent.\n\nIf length of the data is greater than 2 and the first 2 bytes of data match $\\, then information\nabout the files in a specified directory is sent. The information included is the following: file\nattributes, file size and file write time.\n\n\n0x15665665 A new thread is created to exfiltrate the content of a specified file.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Command ID** **Action**\n\n0x16675656 If the kill switch is activated, the current persistence settings (registry and service) are removed\nand the Indexer.exe file is executed (to restart the dropper). If not, the backdoor loop is\nrestarted.\n\n0x14655674 A new thread is created to write the data to a specified file.\n\n0x12635692 If the kill switch is activated, the persistence settings are removed, and all the files used by\nSparrowDoor (Indexer.exe, K7UI.dll and MpSvc.dll) are removed. If not, the backdoor loop is\nrestarted.\n\n\n0x13645683\n\n\nIf the data matches \"switch ”, then the backdoor is restarted with the -d switch.\n\nIf not, it spawns a cmd.exe shell, and sets up named pipes for input and output (used by the\nC&C server) to establish an interactive reverse shell.\n\nIf the data matches Exit\\r\\n, then the spawned shell is terminated.\n\n\nOther Restarts the backdoor loop.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nFamousSparrow is yet another APT group that had access to the ProxyLogon remote code execution vulnerability\nearly in March 2021. It has a history of leveraging known vulnerabilities in server applications such as SharePoint\nand Oracle Opera. This is another reminder that it is critical to patch internet-facing applications quickly, or, if quick\npatching is not possible, to not expose them to the internet at all.\n\nThe targeting, which includes governments worldwide, suggests that FamousSparrow’s intent is espionage. We\nhave highlighted some links to SparklingGoblin and DRBControl, but we don’t consider that these groups are the\nsame.\n\n_[A comprehensive list of Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) and samples can be found in our GitHub repository.](https://github.com/eset/malware-ioc/tree/master/famoussparrow)_\n\n_For any inquiries, or to make sample submissions related to the subject, contact us at threatintel@eset.com._\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n_UPDATE (October 13, 2021): The IP address 45.192.178[.]206 was removed from the Indicators of Compromise.th_\n_This was a mistake on our end._\n\n**SHA-1** **Filename** **ESET detection name** **Description**\n\n\nB9601E60F87545441BF8579B2F62668C56507F4A p64.exe\n\ndebug.log\n\n4DF896624695EA2780552E9EA3C40661DC84EFC8 p64.exe\n\ndebug.log\n\n\nWin64/Riskware.Mimikatz.H Mimikatz\n\nWin64/Riskware.Mimikatz.H Mimikatz\n\n\n76C430B55F180A85F4E1A1E40E4A2EA37DB97599 dump.exe Win64/Kryptik.BSQ Lsass\ndumper\n\n873F98CAF234C3A8A9DB18343DAD7B42117E85D4 nbtscan.exe Win32/NetTool.Nbtscan.A Nbtscan\n\nFDC44057E87D7C350E6DF84BB72541236A770BA2 1.cab Win32/FamousSparrow.A Dropper\n\n\n-----\n\n**SHA-1** **Filename** **ESET detection name** **Description**\n\nC36ECD2E0F38294E1290F4B9B36F602167E33614 Indexer.exe -
