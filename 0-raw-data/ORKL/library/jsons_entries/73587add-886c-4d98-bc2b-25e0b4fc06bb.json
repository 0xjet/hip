Bennett, Barry Vengerik\n\nJun 12, 2017\n\n14 mins read\n\nMalware\n\nIn this blog, we will take a closer look at the powerful, versatile backdoor known as\nCARBANAK (aka Anunak). Specifically, we will focus on the operational details of its use\nover the past few years, including its configuration, the minor variations observed from\n\n\n-----\n\nsample to sample, and its evolution. With these details, we will then draw some conclusions\nabout the operators of CARBANAK. For some additional background on the CARBANAK\nbackdoor, see the papers by Kaspersky and Group-IB and Fox-It.\n\n**Technical Analysis**\n\nBefore we dive into the meat of this blog, a brief technical analysis of the backdoor is\nnecessary to provide some context. CARBANAK is a full-featured backdoor with datastealing capabilities and a plugin architecture. Some of its capabilities include key logging,\ndesktop video capture, VNC, HTTP form grabbing, file system management, file transfer,\nTCP tunneling, HTTP proxy, OS destruction, POS and Outlook data theft and reverse shell.\nMost of these data-stealing capabilities were present in the oldest variants of CARBANAK\nthat we have seen and some were added over time.\n\nMonitoring Threads\n\nThe backdoor may optionally start one or more threads that perform continuous monitoring\nfor various purposes, as described in Table 1.\n\n\n**Thread**\n**Name**\n\nKey\nlogger\n\nForm\ngrabber\n\nPOS\nmonitor\n\nPST\nmonitor\n\nHTTP\nproxy\nmonitor\n\n\n**Description**\n\nLogs key strokes for configured processes and sends them to the command\nand control (C2) server\n\nMonitors HTTP traffic for form data and sends it to the C2 server\n\nMonitors for changes to logs stored in C:\\NSB\\Coalition\\Logs and\nnsb.pos.client.log and sends parsed data to the C2 server\n\nSearches recursively for newly created Outlook personal storage table (PST)\nfiles within user directories and sends them to the C2 server\n\nMonitors HTTP traffic for requests sent to HTTP proxies, saves the proxy\naddress and credentials for future use\n\n\nTable 1: Monitoring threads\n\nCommands\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition to its file management capabilities, this data-stealing backdoor supports 34\ncommands that can be received from the C2 server. After decryption, these 34 commands\nare plain text with parameters that are space delimited much like a command line. The\ncommand and parameter names are hashed before being compared by the binary, making it\ndifficult to recover the original names of commands and parameters. Table 2 lists these\ncommands.\n\n\n**Command**\n**Hash**\n\n\n**Command**\n**Name**\n\n\n**Description**\n\n\n0x0AA37987 loadconfig Runs each command specified in the configuration file\n(see the Configuration section).\n\n0x007AA8A5 state Updates the state value (see the Configuration section).\n\n0x007CFABF video Desktop video recording\n\n0x06E533C4 download Downloads executable and injects into new process\n\n0x00684509 ammyy Ammyy Admin tool\n\n0x07C6A8A5 update Updates self\n\n0x0B22A5A7 Add/Update klgconfig (analysis incomplete)\n\n0x0B77F949 httpproxy Starts HTTP proxy\n\n0x07203363 killos Renders computer unbootable by wiping the MBR\n\n0x078B9664 reboot Reboots the operating system\n\n0x07BC54BC tunnel Creates a network tunnel\n\n0x07B40571 adminka Adds new C2 server or proxy address for pseudo-HTTP\nprotocol\n\n0x079C9CC2 server Adds new C2 server for custom binary protocol\n\n\n-----\n\n0x0007C9C2 user Creates or deletes Windows user account\n\n0x000078B0 rdp Enables concurrent RDP (analysis incomplete)\n\n0x079BAC85 secure Adds Notification Package (analysis incomplete)\n\n0x00006ABC del Deletes file or service\n\n0x0A89AF94 startcmd Adds command to the configuration file (see the\nConfiguration section)\n\n0x079C53BD runmem Downloads executable and injects directly into new\nprocess\n\n0x0F4C3903 logonpasswords Send Windows accounts details to the C2 server\n\n0x0BC205E4 screenshot Takes a screenshot of the desktop and sends it to the\nC2 server\n\n0x007A2BC0 sleep Backdoor sleeps until specified date\n\n0x0006BC6C dupl Unknown\n\n0x04ACAFC3 Upload files to the C2 server\n\n0x00007D43 vnc Runs VNC plugin\n\n0x09C4D055 runfile Runs specified executable file\n\n0x02032914 killbot Uninstalls backdoor\n\n0x08069613 listprocess Returns list of running processes to the C2 server\n\n0x073BE023 plugins Change C2 protocol used by plugins\n\n0x0B0603B4 Download and execute shellcode from specified\naddress\n\n\n-----\n\n0x0B079F93 killprocess Terminates the first process found specified by name\n\n0x00006A34 cmd Initiates a reverse shell to the C2 server\n\n0x09C573C7 runplug Plugin control\n\n0x08CB69DE autorun Updates backdoor\n\nTable 2: Supported Commands\n\nConfiguration\n\nA configuration file resides in a file under the backdoor’s installation directory with the .bin\nextension. It contains commands in the same form as those listed in Table 2 that are\nautomatically executed by the backdoor when it is started. These commands are also\nexecuted when the loadconfig command is issued. This file can be likened to a startup script\nfor the backdoor. The state command sets a global variable containing a series of Boolean\nvalues represented as ASCII values ‘0’ or ‘1’ and also adds itself to the configuration file.\nSome of these values indicate which C2 protocol to use, whether the backdoor has been\ninstalled, and whether the PST monitoring thread is running or not. Other than the state\ncommand, all commands in the configuration file are identified by their hash’s decimal value\ninstead of their plain text name. Certain commands, when executed, add themselves to the\nconfiguration so they will persist across (or be part of) reboots. The loadconfig and state\ncommands are executed during initialization, effectively creating the configuration file if it\ndoes not exist and writing the state command to it.\n\nFigure 1 and Figure 2 illustrate some sample, decoded configuration files we have come\nacross in our investigations.\n\n\n-----\n\nConfiguration file that adds new C2 server and forces the data-stealing backdoor to\nuse it\n\nFigure 1: Configuration file that adds new C2 server and forces the data-stealing backdoor to\n\n\n-----\n\nConfiguration file that adds TCP tunnels and records desktop video\n\n\nuse it\n\nFigure 2: Configuration file that adds TCP tunnels and records desktop video\n\n**Command and Control**\n\nCARBANAK communicates to its C2 servers via pseudo-HTTP or a custom binary protocol.\n\nPseudo-HTTP Protocol\n\nMessages for the pseudo-HTTP protocol are delimited with the ‘|’ character. A message\nstarts with a host ID composed by concatenating a hash value generated from the\ncomputer’s hostname and MAC address to a string likely used as a campaign code. Once\nthe message has been formatted, it is sandwiched between an additional two fields of\nrandomly generated strings of upper and lower case alphabet characters. An example of a\ncommand polling message and a response to the listprocess command are given in Figure 3\nand Figure 4, respectively.\n\n\n-----\n\nExample command polling message\n\n\nFigure 3: Example command polling message\n\n\n-----\n\nExample command response message\n\n\nFigure 4: Example command response message\nMessages are encrypted using Microsoft’s implementation of RC2 in CBC mode with\nPKCS#5 padding. The encrypted message is then Base64 encoded, replacing all the ‘/’ and\n‘+’ characters with the ‘.’ and ‘-’ characters, respectively. The eight-byte initialization vector\n(IV) is a randomly generated string consisting of upper and lower case alphabet characters.\nIt is prepended to the encrypted and encoded message.\n\nThe encoded payload is then made to look like a URI by having a random number of ‘/’\ncharacters inserted at random locations within the encoded payload. The malware then\nappends a script extension (php, bml, or cgi) with a random number of random parameters\nor a file extension from the following list with no parameters: gif, jpg, png, htm, html, php.\n\nThis URI is then used in a GET or POST request. The body of the POST request may\ncontain files contained in the cabinet format. A sample GET request is shown in Figure 5.\n\n\n-----\n\nSample pseudo-HTTP beacon\n\n\nFigure 5: Sample pseudo-HTTP beacon\nThe pseudo-HTTP protocol uses any proxies discovered by the HTTP proxy monitoring\nthread or added by the adminka command. The backdoor also searches for proxy\nconfigurations to use in the registry at\nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Internet Settings and for each profile in\nthe Mozilla Firefox configuration file at %AppData%\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\<ProfileName>\\prefs.js.\n\nCustom Binary Protocol\n\nFigure 6 describes the structure of the malware’s custom binary protocol. If a message is\nlarger than 150 bytes, it is compressed with an unidentified algorithm. If a message is larger\nthan 4096 bytes, it is broken into compressed chunks. This protocol has undergone several\nchanges over the years, each version building upon the previous version in some way.\nThese changes were likely introduced to render existing network signatures ineffective and\nto make signature creation more difficult.\n\n\n-----\n\nBinary protocol message format\n\n\nFigure 6: Binary protocol message format\n_Version 1_\n\nIn the earliest version of the binary protocol, we have discovered that the message bodies\nthat are stored in the <chunkData> field are simply XORed with the host ID. The initial\nmessage is not encrypted and contains the host ID.\n\n_Version 2_\n\nRather than using the host ID as the key, this version uses a random XOR key between 32\nand 64 bytes in length that is generated for each session. This key is sent in the initial\nmessage.\n\n_Version 3_\n\nVersion 3 adds encryption to the headers. The first 19 bytes of the message headers (up to\nthe <hdrXORKey2> field) are XORed with a five-byte key that is randomly generated per\nmessage and stored in the <hdrXORKey2> field If the <flag> field of the message header is\n\n\n-----\n\ngreater than one, the XOR key used to encrypt message bodies is iterated in reverse when\nencrypting and decrypting messages.\n\n_Version 4_\n\nThis version adds a bit more complexity to the header encryption scheme. The headers are\nXOR encrypted with <hdrXORKey1> and <hdrXORKey2> combined and reversed.\n\n_Version 5_\n\nVersion 5 is the most sophisticated of the binary protocols we have seen. A 256-bit AES\nsession key is generated and used to encrypt both message headers and bodies separately.\nInitially, the key is sent to the C2 server with the entire message and headers encrypted with\nthe RSA key exchange algorithm. All subsequent messages are encrypted with AES in CBC\nmode. The use of public key cryptography makes decryption of the session key infeasible\nwithout the C2 server’s private key.\n\n**The Roundup**\n\nWe have rounded up 220 samples of the CARBANAK backdoor and compiled a table that\nhighlights some interesting details that we were able to extract. It should be noted that in\nmost of these cases the backdoor was embedded as a packed payload in another\nexecutable or in a weaponized document file of some kind. The MD5 hash is for the original\nexecutable file that eventually launches CARBANAK, but the details of each sample were\nextracted from memory during execution. This data provides us with a unique insight into the\n[operational aspect of CARBANAK and can be downloaded here.](https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/blog/pdfs/carbanak-report.xlsx)\n\nProtocol Evolution\n\nAs described earlier, CARBANAK’s binary protocol has undergone several significant\nchanges over the years. Figure 7 illustrates a rough timeline of this evolution based on the\ncompile times of samples we have in our collection. This may not be entirely accurate\nbecause our visibility is not complete, but it gives us a general idea as to when the changes\noccurred. It has been observed that some builds of this data-stealing backdoor use outdated\nversions of the protocol. This may suggest multiple groups of operators compiling their own\nbuilds of this data-stealing backdoor independently.\n\n\n-----\n\nTimeline of binary protocol versions\n\n\nFigure 7: Timeline of binary protocol versions\n*It is likely that we are missing an earlier build that utilized version 3.\n\nBuild Tool\n\nMost of CARBANAK’s strings are encrypted in order to make analysis more difficult. We\nhave observed that the key and the cipher texts for all the encrypted strings are changed for\neach sample that we have encountered, even amongst samples with the same compile time.\nThe RC2 key used for the HTTP protocol has also been observed to change among samples\nwith the same compile time. These observations paired with the use of campaign codes that\nmust be configured denote the likely existence of a build tool.\n\nRapid Builds\n\nDespite the likelihood of a build tool, we have found 57 unique compile times in our sample\nset, with some of the compile times being quite close in proximity. For example, on May 20,\n2014 two builds were compiled approximately four hours apart and were configured to use\n\n\n-----\n\nthe same C2 servers. Again, on July 30, 2015, two builds were compiled approximately 12\nhours apart.\n\nWhat changes in the code can we see in such short time intervals that would not be present\nin a build tool? In one case, one build was programmed to execute the runmem command for\na file named wi.exe while the other was not. This command downloads an executable from\nthe C2 and directly runs it in memory. In another case, one build was programmed to check\nfor the existence of the domain blizko.net in the trusted sites list for Internet Explorer while\nthe other was not. Blizko is an online money transfer service. We have also seen that\ndifferent monitoring threads from Table 1 are enabled from build to build. These minor\nchanges suggest that the code is quickly modified and compiled to adapt to the needs of the\noperator for particular targets.\n\nCampaign Code and Compile Time Correlation\n\nIn some cases, there is a close proximity of the compile time of a CARBANAK sample to the\nmonth specified in a particular campaign code. Figure 8 shows some of the relationships that\ncan be observed in our data set.\n\n**Campaign Code** **Compile Date**\n\nAug 7/30/15\n\ndec 12/8/14\n\njulyc 7/2/16\n\njun 5/9/15\n\njune 5/25/14\n\njune 6/7/14\n\njunevnc 6/20/14\n\njuspam 7/13/14\n\njuupd 7/13/14\n\nmay 5/20/14\n\n\n-----\n\nmay 5/19/15\n\nndjun 6/7/16\n\nSeP 9/12/14\n\nspamaug 8/1/14\n\nspaug 8/1/14\n\nFigure 8: Campaign code to compile time relationships\n\nRecent Updates\n\nRecently, 64 bit variants of the backdoor have been discovered. We shared details about\n[such variants in a recent blog post. Some of these variants are programmed to sleep until a](https://www.fireeye.com/resources/fin7-shim-databases-persistence)\nconfigured activation date when they will become active.\n\n**History**\n\nThe “Carbanak Group”\n\nMuch of the publicly released reporting surrounding the CARBANAK malware refers to a\ncorresponding “Carbanak Group”, who appears to be behind the malicious activity\nassociated with this data-stealing backdoor. FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence has tracked several\nseparate overarching campaigns employing the CARBANAK tool and other associated\nbackdoors, such as DRIFTPIN (aka Toshliph). With the data available at this time, it is\nunclear how interconnected these campaigns are – if they are all directly orchestrated by the\nsame criminal group, or if these campaigns were perpetrated by loosely affiliated actors\nsharing malware and techniques.\n\nFIN7\n\nIn all Mandiant investigations to date where the CARBANAK backdoor has been discovered,\nthe activity has been attributed to the FIN7 threat group. FIN7 has been extremely active\nagainst the U.S. restaurant and hospitality industries since mid-2015.\n\nFIN7 uses CARBANAK as a post-exploitation tool in later phases of an intrusion to cement\ntheir foothold in a network and maintain access, frequently using the video command to\nmonitor users and learn about the victim network, as well as the tunnel command to proxy\nconnections into isolated portions of the victim environment. FIN7 has consistently utilized\nlegally purchased code signing certificates to sign their CARBANAK payloads. Finally, FIN7\nhas leveraged several new techniques that we have not observed in other CARBANAK\nrelated activity.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe have covered recent FIN7 activity in previous public blog posts:\n\nThe FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence MySIGHT Portal contains additional information on our\ninvestigations and observations into FIN7 activity.\n\nWidespread Bank Targeting Throughout the U.S., Middle East and Asia\n\nProofpoint initially reported on a widespread campaign targeting banks and financial\norganizations throughout the U.S. and Middle East in early 2016. We identified several\nadditional organizations in these regions, as well as in Southeast Asia and Southwest Asia\nbeing targeted by the same attackers.\n\nThis cluster of activity persisted from late 2014 into early 2016. Most notably, the\ninfrastructure utilized in this campaign overlapped with LAZIOK, NETWIRE and other\nmalware targeting similar financial entities in these regions.\n\nDRIFTPIN\n\nDRIFTPIN (aka Spy.Agent.ORM, and Toshliph) has been previously associated with\nCARBANAK in various campaigns. We have seen it deployed in initial spear phishing by\nFIN7 in the first half of 2016. Also, in late 2015, ESET reported on CARBANAK associated\nattacks, detailing a spear phishing campaign targeting Russian and Eastern European banks\nusing DRIFTPIN as the malicious payload. Cyphort Labs also revealed that variants of\nDRIFTPIN associated with this cluster of activity had been deployed via the RIG exploit kit\nplaced on two compromised Ukrainian banks’ websites.\n\nFireEye iSIGHT Intelligence observed this wave of spear phishing aimed at a large array of\ntargets, including U.S. financial institutions and companies associated with Bitcoin trading\nand mining activities. This cluster of activity continues to be active now to this day, targeting\nsimilar entities. Additional details on this latest activity are available on the FireEye iSIGHT\nIntelligence MySIGHT Portal.\n\nEarlier CARBANAK Activity\n\nIn December 2014, Group-IB and Fox-IT released a report about an organized criminal\n[group using malware called \"Anunak\" that has targeted Eastern European banks, U.S. and](https://www.fox-it.com/en/files/2014/12/Anunak_APT-against-financial-institutions2.pdf)\n[European point-of-sale systems and other entities. Kaspersky released a similar report about](https://securelist.com/blog/research/68732/the-great-bank-robbery-the-carbanak-apt/)\nthe same group under the name \"Carbanak\" in February 2015. The name “Carbanak” was\ncoined by Kaspersky in this report – the malware authors refer to the backdoor as Anunak.\n\nThis activity was further linked to the 2014 exploitation of ATMs in Ukraine. Additionally,\nsome of this early activity shares a similarity with current FIN7 operations – the use of Power\nAdmin PAExec for lateral movement.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe details that can be extracted from CARBANAK provide us with a unique insight into the\noperational details behind this data-stealing malware. Several inferences can be made when\nlooking at such data in bulk as we discussed above and are summarized as follows:\n\n1. Based upon the information we have observed, we believe that at least some of the\n\noperators of CARBANAK either have access to the source code directly with\nknowledge on how to modify it or have a close relationship to the developer(s).\n2. Some of the operators may be compiling their own builds of the backdoor\n\nindependently.\n3. A build tool is likely being used by these attackers that allows the operator to configure\n\ndetails such as C2 addresses, C2 encryption keys, and a campaign code. This build\ntool encrypts the binary’s strings with a fresh key for each build.\n4. Varying campaign codes indicate that independent or loosely affiliated criminal actors\n\nare employing CARBANAK in a wide-range of intrusions that target a variety of\nindustries but are especially directed at financial institutions across the globe, as well\nas the restaurant and hospitality sectors within the U.S.\n\n\n-----",
