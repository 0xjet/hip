AUTOMATION 1\n\n\n-----\n\n### H1 2020 Report at a glance\n\n##### Overall downward trend for percentages of attacked computers globally\n\nBeginning in H2 2019 we have observed a tendency for decreases in the percentages of\nattacked computers, both in the ICS and in the corporate and personal environments.\n\n1. In H1 2020 the percentage of ICS computers on which malicious objects were blocked\n\nhas decreased by 6.6 percentage points to 32.6%.\n\n2. The number was highest in Algeria (58.1%), and lowest in Switzerland (12.7%).\n\n3. Despite the overall tendency for the percentages of attacked computers to decrease,\n\nwe did see the number grow in the Oil & Gas sector by 1.6 p.p. to 37.8% and by 1.9\np.p. to 39.9 % for computers used in building automation systems. These numbers are\nhigher than the percentages around the world overall.\n\n##### Variety of malware\n\nThreats are becoming more targeted and more focused, and as a result, more varied and\ncomplex.\n\n4. Kaspersky solutions in ICS environments blocked over 19.7 thousand malware\n\nmodifications from 4,119 different families.\n\n5. We are seeing noticeably more families of backdoors, spyware, Win32 exploits and\n\nmalware built on the .Net platform.\n\n6. Ransomware was blocked on 0.63% of ICS computers. This is very similar to the total\n\nof 0.61% in H2 2019.\n\n##### Main threat sources\n\nThe internet, removable media and email continue to be the main sources of threats in the ICS\nenvironment. Predictably, the percentages in the rankings for these threats have decreased.\n\n7. Internet threats were blocked on 16.7% of ICS computers (-6.4 p.p.).\n\n8. Threats penetrating when removable media are connected were blocked on 5.8% of\n\ncomputers (-1.9 p.p.).\n\n9. Malicious email attachments were blocked on 3.4% of ICS computers (-1.1 p.p.).\n\n##### Regional differences\n\nAsia and Africa were the least secure.\n\n10. Asian regions occupy 4 out of the TOP 5 positions in the regional rankings based on\n\nthe percentage of ICS computers which were attacked. Africa comes second.\n\n11. Southeast Asia is the worst hit - it leads in several ratings:\n\n               - Percentage of ICS computers where malicious activity was blocked – 49.8%.\n\n               - percentage of ICS computers where internet threats were blocked – 14.9%.\n\n               - Percentage of ICS computers where malicious email attachments were blocked 5.8%.\n\n12. Africa leads in the ranking of regions by percentage of ICS computers where\n\nmalicious activity was blocked when removable media were connected with (14.9%).\n\nTHREAT LANDSCAPE FOR INDUSTRIAL AUTOMATION 2\n\n\n-----\n\n**The situation is best in Australia, Europe, USA and Canada, which are in at the bottom in all**\nof the rankings except by malicious email attachments.\n\n13. Northern Europe is the most secure region with the lowest positions in rankings in H1\n\n2020:\n\n               - by percentage of ICS computers attacked – 10.1%,\n\n               - by percentage of ICS computers on which internet threats were blocked – 4.6%,\n\n               - By percentage of ICS computers where malicious email attachments were\nblocked (1.1%).\n\n14. The lowest percentage of ICS computers on which threats were blocked when\n\nremovable media were connected was in Australia – 0.8%. Northern Europe came in\nwith a close second of 0.9%.\n\n15. In Australia, Europe, USA and Canada the percentages in the rankings by malicious\n\nemail attachments were higher than by threats on removable media with Eastern\nEurope as the exception – 3.5% and 3.7% respectively.\n\nSouthern and Eastern Europe were the least secure regions in Europe.\n\n16. Southern and Eastern Europe were in the TOP 5 of the rankings by percentages of\n\nICS computers where malicious email attachments were blocked. Southern Europe\ncame in second with 5.2% and Eastern Europe fifth with 3.5%.\n\n17. Eastern Europe was the only region in the world where we saw an increase of 0.9 p.p.\n\nin the percentage of computers where threats were blocked when removable media\nwere connected, coming in with 3.7%.\n\nTHREAT LANDSCAPE FOR INDUSTRIAL AUTOMATION 3\n\n\n-----\n\n### Key events of H1 2020\n\n##### Attack on steel maker BlueScope\n\n[On May 15, steel maker BlueScope reported an attack](https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/bluescope-corporate-umbraco-media/media/2832/200515-asx-release-bluescope-update-15-may-2020.pdf) which caused disruptions to some of\nthe company’s enterprises.\n\nThe cybersecurity incident was detected in one of the company’s US businesses. In addition\nto enterprises in the US, the attack had a slight effect on the company’s businesses in Asia\nand New Zealand. The greatest impact was on manufacturing and sales operations in\nAustralia: some processes were paused and others, including steel dispatches, continued\nmostly without using automation tools.\n\nNo other details of the attack have been disclosed so far.\n\n##### APT attacks on industrial companies\n\n###### WildPressure targeted campaign\n\n[In March 2020, Kaspersky experts discovered](https://securelist.com/wildpressure-targets-industrial-in-the-middle-east/96360/) a previously unknown APT campaign\ndistributing a Trojan that was dubbed Milum. According to research results, the malware had\nbeen used at least since early 2019 exclusively for attacks on targets in the Middle East, which\nincluded industrial organizations. The campaign was named WildPressure.\n\nMilum has the capability to control devices remotely. It can download and execute commands\nsent by its operator, collect a variety of information from the target device and send it to its\nC&C server. For their campaign infrastructure, the operators used rented OVH and\nNetzbetrieb virtual private servers (VPS) and a domain registered with the Domains by Proxy\nanonymization service.\n\nA code analysis of the new malware did not show any notable overlaps or similarities with any\npreviously known APT campaign.\n\n###### Malicious campaigns against government and industrial organizations of Azerbaijan\n\n[In April 2020, a report was published on targeted attacks](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2020/04/poetrat-covid-19-lures.html) that involved a previously unknown\nremote-access Trojan (RAT), which was dubbed PoetRAT.\n\nAccording to the researchers, the attacks targeted Azerbaijan’s government sector,\ntransportation and industrial companies, primarily those in the energy sector. The investigation\nestablished that the attackers were particularly interested in SCADA systems connected with\nwind turbines.\n\nCisco Talos experts have tracked these attacks since February 2020. Kaspersky experts\nidentified them in December 2019, reporting them in a private report. The attackers used\na malicious document containing an image that looked like the logo of the Defense R&D\nOrganization of the Indian ministry of defense. Two more attack waves followed in April,\none of which used what looked like the Azerbaijani government’s documents on COVID-19\nas decoys. In the other case, the attackers used a file named “C19.docx” with no readable\ncontent, possibly also a reference to COVID-19.\n\nTHREAT LANDSCAPE FOR INDUSTRIAL AUTOMATION 4\n\n\n-----\n\nMicrosoft Word documents were used as droppers that installed the Trojan without the user’s\nknowledge. After a document was opened, a macro (Visual Basic script) or code using DDE\n(Dynamic Data Exchange) was run, extracting the malware and executing it.\n\nThe first–stage PoetRAT malware is written in Python. Numerous additional tools, most also\nwritten in Python, were found on victims’ computers. Malware written in Python has been used\nin attacks on industrial companies before – such as in the case of the Triton attack.\n\nAnother finding made in the course of the investigation was a phishing website imitating the\nwebmail of the Government of Azerbaijan and designed to steal user credentials.\n\n###### Targeted attacks on Israeli water supply and wastewater treatment facilities\n\n[On April 23, the Israel National Cyber Directorate (INCD) issued a security advisory, which](https://www.gov.il/he/departments/publications/reports/scadaalert)\nreported attempted attacks on SCADA systems of water treatment plants, water pumping\nstations and sewage networks. It was recommended that water and power supply utilities\nurgently change passwords for all systems connecting to the internet as an intrusion\nprevention measure. The importance of implementing these measures for systems used to\nmanage the amount of chlorine added to water was particularly emphasized. Other\nrecommendations included updating the software and equipment firmware used.\n\n[Similar warnings were also published](https://www.zdnet.com/article/israel-says-hackers-are-targeting-its-water-supply-and-treatment-utilities/) by Israel’s Computer Emergency Response Team\n(CERT) and by the Israeli government's Water Authority.\n\nThere were no official reports of confirmed intrusion into any Israeli water treatment or water\nsupply company, but [according to mass media, attacks took place on Friday and Saturday](https://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-5720969,00.html)\n(April 24 and 25) and affected a number of organizations in different parts of the country.\n\n##### Ransomware attacks on industrial companies\n\nThe wave of ransomware attacks that hit the world in 2019 continued through the first six\nmonths of 2020.\n\n###### Ransomware attack paralyzes production at Picanol plants in Belgium, Romania and China\n\nOn January 13, 2020 Picanol Group, a large manufacturer of high-tech weaving machines,\n[fell victim to a massive ransomware attack.](http://assets.picanolgroup.com/Press%20Releases/2020%20PR%20Picanol%20Group%2031012020%20En.pdf) The attack seriously disrupted the operations of\nthe company’s manufacturing plants in Belgium, Romania and China. No information has been\nreleased on the ransomware used in the attack.\n\nThe attack was discovered during the night, when Picanol employees in China were unable to\naccess the company’s IT systems. Similar issues also arose in Ypres in Belgium. The\ncompany’s operations were nearly completely paralyzed. Picanol’s 2300 employees were out\nof work for over a week.\n\n###### Ryuk attacks on medical organizations\n\n[In H1 2020, Ryuk operators perpetrated massive attacks](https://ics-cert.kaspersky.com/news/2020/04/03/ryuk-attacks-continue/) on hospitals, demanding ransom to\n[decrypt the files. In March alone, 10 hospitals fell victim](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ryuk-ransomware-keeps-targeting-hospitals-during-the-pandemic/) to Ryuk attacks in the US.\n\nThe attacks were based on the already familiar Ryuk infection scheme involving phishing\nemails and TrickBot malware, which enables the attackers to connect to an infected computer\nand explore the network of the organization under attack. TrickBot operators try to find\nvulnerable systems and to steal user credentials.\n\nTHREAT LANDSCAPE FOR INDUSTRIAL AUTOMATION 5\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Ransomware attacks on pumping solution manufacturer DESMI\n\nOn the night of April 7-8, DESMI, a Danish manufacturer of pumping solutions for marine and\nindustrial applications, suffered a ransomware attack. No information is available on the\nmalware used in the attack.\n\n[According to an official statement, the attack affected the company’s communication systems,](https://www.desmi.com/news-(3)/desmi-hit-by-cyber-attack.aspx)\nincluding email, which had to be temporarily disconnected. The company was able to recover\nthese systems by April 14. The ERP and financial systems were not affected, enabling the\ncompany’s manufacturing sites in China, India, America and Denmark to continue working as\nnormal, with only minor disturbances.\n\n###### Ragnar Locker attack on energy company EDP\n\n[On April 13, Energias de Portugal (EDP), a large Portuguese energy company, suffered](https://www.zdnet.com/article/edp-energy-confirms-cyberattack-ragnar-locker-ransomware-blamed/)\na ransomware attack. As a result of the attack, which involved the Ragnar Locker malware,\n[the company’s systems were encrypted. Moreover, the cybercriminals claimed to have stolen](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ragnarlocker-ransomware-hits-edp-energy-giant-asks-for-10m/)\n10 TB of sensitive company files before encrypting the data. They threatened to make that\ninformation public unless they were paid a ransom of 1580 BTC (about $10.9 million).\n\nTo prove that they really held sensitive information belonging to EDP, Ragnar Locker operators\npublished some of the stolen data, including employee account names and passwords.\n\nAccording to the ransom note, the attackers had also gained access to confidential information\non the company’s billing, contracts, transactions, clients and partners.\n\n[After analyzing different samples of the ransomware, Kaspersky experts concluded that the](https://ics-cert.kaspersky.com/news/2020/04/17/new-ransomware/)\nentire text of the ransom note is created specifically for each individual victim, which means\nthat Ragnar Locker attacks are targeted in nature.\n\n###### Attack on Stadler industrial facilities\n\n[On May 7, 2020 Stadler, a Swiss manufacturer of railway rolling stock, reported](https://www.railwaygazette.com/business/cyberattack-seeks-to-extort-money-from-stadler/56477.article) a cyberattack\n[on its industrial facilities. According to the company’s statement, some computers on their](https://www.stadlerrail.com/media/pdf/2020_0507_medienmitteilung_cyberangriff_de.pdf)\ncorporate network were infected with malware and data was stolen from the compromised\nmachines. The threat actors behind the attack contacted company personnel, demanded\na ransom and threatened to publish the stolen data if the victim refused to pay up.\n\nStadler turned to the appropriate government agencies and hired external IT security experts\nto assist with incident investigation. Backup copies were used to restore the affected systems\nand operational processes were not affected by the attack.\n\nThe company did not reveal which malware was used in the attack. However, since a ransom\nwas demanded and systems needed to be restored from backups, it is highly likely that\nStadler was the victim of a ransomware attack.\n\n###### Mailto and Nefilim attacks on logistics company Toll Group\n\nIn the first half of 2010, Toll Group, an Australian logistics company, was attacked by\nransomware on two occasions.\n\n[The first attack took place in late January. A variant of Mailto ransomware was used. To prevent](https://web.archive.org/web/20200206023501/https:/www.tollgroup.com/toll-it-systems-update)\nthe malware from spreading, the company disabled some of its information systems, resulting in\ndelayed shipments to both corporate and individual customers. Australia’s national postal\nservice, Australia Post, was among the Toll Group customers whose shipments were delayed.\n\nTHREAT LANDSCAPE FOR INDUSTRIAL AUTOMATION 6\n\n\n-----\n\n[Toll Group experienced the second attack in May, when one of the company’s corporate](https://www.tollgroup.com/toll-it-systems-updates)\nsystems was infected with Nefilim ransomware. Data stored on the affected system included\ninformation on the company’s employees, as well as some agreements with corporate\ncustomers. Before encrypting files, the attackers stole about 200 gigabytes of data and\ndemanded a ransom to unblock the IT systems. However, the management of Toll Group\nrefused to make a deal with them. In response to the incident, all of the company’s IT systems\nwere shut down.\n\nOn May 20, it became known that Nefilim operators had published part of the stolen data.\n\nBy May 29, Toll Group had restored all of its information systems and logistics operations.\n\n###### Attack of Sodinokibi encryption malware on energy companies\n\n[On May 14, 2020, Elexon, a major British electric utility company, reported](https://www.elexonportal.co.uk/news/view/27108?cachebust=ebf1vtjsp0) a malware infection\nof their IT network. Only systems on the internal IT network suffered as a result of the attack,\nincluding the email system and laptops. Key IT services and electricity supply systems were\nnot impacted.\n\n[In June, it was reported that the company had been attacked with the Sodinokibi encryption](https://cybleinc.com/2020/06/01/revil-ransomware-operators-targets-elexon-well-known-administer-of-balancing-and-settlement-code-bsc/)\nransomware, also known as REvil.\n\n[Later, the Brazilian electric power utility Light S.A. became](https://www.appgate.com/blog/electric-company-ransomware-attack-calls-for-14-million-in-ransom) another victim of Sodinokibi.\n[According to mass media, the company was attacked by the ransomware in late June. The](https://vejario.abril.com.br/cidade/hackers-invadem-light-resgate/)\noperators of the ransomware demanded a ransom in Monero cryptocurrency amounting to\nabout $7 mln. After June 19, the ransom doubled to about $14 million.\n\nThe attack did not have a negative impact on power supply but it disrupted the company’s\nbilling-related business processes. Although it was officially confirmed that the attack had\ntaken place, no other details of the incident were disclosed.\n\nLater, researchers [found a sample](https://www.appgate.com/blog/electric-company-ransomware-attack-calls-for-14-million-in-ransom) of Sodinokibi malware, which is likely to have been used in\nthe attack on Light S.A. The malware is distributed using the Ransomware-as-a-Service,\n(RaaS) model and is likely to be associated with the Pinchy Spider criminal group, which was\nbehind the GandCrab ransomware.\n\n###### Attack on beverage manufacturer Lion\n\n[On June 9, Australian beverage manufacturer Lion fell victim to a ransomware attack. The](https://www.lionco.com/media-centre/lion-update-re-cyber-issue)\ncompany had to shut down infected IT systems, resulting in the suspension of some industrial\nprocesses and impacting product shipments to customers. Specifically, the company paused\nproduction at its breweries in Australia and New Zealand. The attack also affected the\noperation of Lion Dairy & Drinks production sites responsible for making a variety of dairy\nproducts.\n\nNo information has been published on the ransomware used in the attack on Lion.\n\nOn June 18, Lion suffered another ransomware attack. [According to mass media, Sodinokibi](https://www.itwire.com/security/attackers-give-lion-deadline-for-paying-ransom-of-us%24800,000.html)\n(REvil) malware was used in the second attack. The attackers demanded a ransom of\n12234.28 XMR (about $800,000) and threatened to publish sensitive data stolen from the\ncompany. They also threatened to double their ransom demands if the money was not paid\nby June 19.\n\nAccording to the latest information on the company’s official website, by June 26 all of the\ncompany’s production sites had been restored to normal operation but the work to recover\ntheir IT systems had not been completed.\n\nTHREAT LANDSCAPE FOR INDUSTRIAL AUTOMATION 7\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Targeted attacks on industrial companies involving Snake ransomware\n\n[On June 8, 2020 issues were reported](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/06/08/honda-could-victim-ransomware-cyber-attack/) which affected the computer networks of Honda,\na Japanese motorcycle and auto manufacturer, in Europe and Japan. Specifically, it was\n[announced that Honda Customer Service and Honda Financial Services were experiencing](https://twitter.com/HondaCustSvc/status/1270048801307234304?s=20)\ntechnical difficulties.\n\nInformation security experts believe that, in all likelihood, one of the company’s servers was\ninfected with Snake (EKANS) ransomware: a sample of the Snake malware was discovered\non VirusTotal, which checks for Honda’s domain name, “mds.honda.com” (which is probably\nused on the company’s internal network). If the domain name cannot be resolved (i.e., if the\ncorresponding IP address cannot be determined), the ransomware terminates without\nencrypting any files. According to the researchers, this could indicate that the attackers’\nactivity is targeted in nature.\n\nKaspersky ICS CERT experts used their own telemetry data to identify other samples that\nwere similar to the sample uploaded to VirusTotal.\n\n[The results of our research clearly indicate](https://ics-cert.kaspersky.com/alerts/2020/06/17/targeted-attacks-on-industrial-companies-using-snake-ransomware/) that the attackers carry out multistage hacker\nattacks, each attack targeting a specific organization. Encrypting files using Snake is the final\nstage of these attacks. The Snake ransomware is written in Golang programming language,\nwhich is not very widely used and is found today primarily in malware samples used by APT\ngroups.\n\nIt is known that, in addition to Honda, victims include [power company Enel Group. According](https://securityboulevard.com/2020/06/snake-ransomware-affected-enel-groups-internal-network/)\nto Kaspersky ICS CERT data, attack targets also include a German company that supplies its\nproducts to auto makers and other industrial manufacturers and a German manufacturer of\nmedical equipment and supplies. Apparently, other auto makers and manufacturing\ncompanies have also been attacked: similar Snake samples have been detected on\ncomputers in China, Japan and Europe.\n\nTHREAT LANDSCAPE FOR INDUSTRIAL AUTOMATION 8\n\n\n-----\n\n### Impact of COVID-19 pandemic\n\nIn the course of our research, we couldn’t ignore the widely discussed issue of the impact that\nthe COVID-19 pandemic had on the threat landscape for industrial organizations as a whole\nand their OT networks in particular.\n\nIt was only to be expected that threat actors would use the pandemic and the global changes\ncaused by it in their own interests. As numerous sources have reported on many occasions,\nthe subject of the COVID-19 pandemic is exploited in a large number of phishing attacks, both\nmass-scale and targeted.\n\nIn one of our private reports available by subscription, we described an APT attack that targets\nAzerbaijani enterprises and institutions and makes use of COVID-related documents.\n\n\n**One of the**\n**malicious**\n**documents**\n**exploiting the**\n**subject of**\n**COVID-19 which**\n**were used in an**\n**APT attack**\n\n\nHowever, a quantitative assessment of changes to the ICS threat landscape has yielded\nunexpected results. The only noticeable global trend for growth in the percentage of attacked\nICS computers can only be traced when analyzing the statistics of attacks on RDP (Remote\nDesktop Protocol) on industrial computers.\n\nIn February – May 2020, there was a clear month-to-month growth (with a subsequent\ndecrease in June) in the percentage of ICS computers on which Kaspersky solutions detected\nattempts to crack RDP passwords through brute force attacks.\n\nTHREAT LANDSCAPE FOR INDUSTRIAL AUTOMATION 9\n\n\n-----\n\n**Percentage of ICS**\n**computers on**\n**which attempts to**\n**brute force RDP**\n**passwords were**\n**identified**\n\n\n**Percentage of ICS**\n**computers**\n**available via RDP,**\n**January 2019 –**\n**June 2020**\n\n\nAs we can see in the diagram, the amplitude of the spring growth in the percentage of ICS\ncomputers subjected to brute force attacks does not exceed that of the annual fluctuations,\nalthough, in this case, the growth was more extended in time than all the previous surges.\n\nApparently, the increases in the percentage of attacked ICS computers based on this\nparameter were provoked by RDP being used more often in February – June 2020.\n\nCuriously, the growth in the percentage of ICS computers on which RDP was enabled in the\nfirst quarter of 2020 occurred against the background of a sufficiently long period of attempts\nto reduce the use of RATs by industrial enterprises. The diagram below clearly shows the\ndecrease in the percentage of ICS computers on which remote administration tools were used\nthroughout the year 2019. It is worth noting that this parameter stabilized in H1 2020 (and\nthere was even a slight growth in February – April compared to January) – a phenomenon not\nobserved in winter and spring 2019. This may also be due to the pandemic.\n\n\nTHREAT LANDSCAPE FOR INDUSTRIAL AUTOMATION 10\n\n\n-----\n\n**Percentage of ICS**\n**computers on**\n**which RATs were**\n**used, January**\n**2019 – June 2020**\n\n\nWe believe that the increase in the percentage of ICS computers on which RDP is used could\nbe an indication that most new RDP sessions were authorized by IT and information security\nservices. In fact, all other things being equal, it may be easier to configure and control the\nsecure operation of RDP services than that of any other RAT applications. It would seem that\nallowing new RDP installations was a compromise caused by the objective need to perform\nproduction-related tasks remotely in a pandemic.\n\nThe increase in the percentage of attacked ICS computers on which attempts to brute force\nthe RDP password were detected (and prevented) may seem insignificant, but it should be\nremembered that any such attack, if successful, would immediately have provided the\nattackers with remote access to engineering computers and ICS systems. The danger posed\nby such attacks should not be underestimated.\n\nAs mentioned above, we have so far been unable to identify any other abnormal surges in\nmalicious activity that could be attributed to the pandemic’s consequences. We hope this was\ndue to an actual absence of negative changes in the ICS threat landscape.\n\nTHREAT LANDSCAPE FOR INDUSTRIAL AUTOMATION 11\n\n\n-----\n\n### Overall global statistics\n\n###### In this section, we present the findings of an analysis of statistical data obtained using the Kaspersky Security Network (KSN), a distributed antivirus network. The data was received from those KSN users who gave their voluntary consent to have data anonymously transferred from their computers and processed for the purpose described in the KSN Agreement for the Kaspersky product installed on their computer.\n\n Connecting to the KSN network enables our customers to reduce the time it takes the security solutions installed on their systems to respond to previously unknown threats and to improve the overall detection quality provided by the security products through querying the cloud infrastructure in which malicious object data is stored. That data is technically impossible to transfer entirely to the client side due to its large size and resource consumption. \n\n The telemetry data transferred by the user includes only those types and categories of information which are described in the relevant KSN Agreement. That data is not only significantly helpful in analyzing the threat landscape, but it is also necessary to identify new threats, including targeted attacks and APTs[1].\n\n##### Methodology used to prepare statistics\n\nThe statistical data presented in the report was received from ICS computers protected by\nKaspersky products that Kaspersky ICS CERT categorizes as part of the industrial\ninfrastructure at organizations. This group includes Windows computers that perform one or\nseveral of the following functions:\n\n            - supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) servers,\n\n            - data storage servers (Historian),\n\n            - data gateways (OPC),\n\n            - stationary workstations of engineers and operators,\n\n            - mobile workstations of engineers and operators,\n\n            - Human Machine Interface (HMI),\n\n            - computers used for industrial network administration,\n\n            - computers used to develop software for industrial automation systems.\n\nFor the purposes of this report, attacked computers are those on which Kaspersky security\nsolutions blocked one or more threats during the reporting period. When determining\npercentages of machines on which malware infections were prevented, we use the ratio of the\nnumber of computers attacked during the reporting period to the total number of computers in\nour sample from which we received anonymized information during the reporting period.\n\n1 We recommend that organizations which have any restrictions in place with respect to transferring data\n[outside the organization’s perimeter should consider using the Kaspersky Private Security Network](https://www.kaspersky.com/enterprise-security/private-security-network)\nservice.\n\nTHREAT LANDSCAPE FOR INDUSTRIAL AUTOMATION 12\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Common tendencies in the threat landscape for ICS, corporate and personal computers\n\nWe have observed a decline in the percentages of attacked computers since H2 2019 in ICS\nenvironments as well as in corporate and personal computing.\n\n\n**Percentage of**\n**computers**\n**_(all Kaspersky_**\n**_customers) on_**\n**which malicious**\n**objects were**\n**blocked by month**\n**(January 2019 –**\n**June 2020)**\n\n\n**Percentage of ICS**\n**_computers on_**\n**which malicious**\n**objects were**\n**blocked by month**\n**(January 2019 –**\n**June 2020)**\n\n\nTHREAT LANDSCAPE FOR INDUSTRIAL AUTOMATION 13\n\n\n-----\n\nThe reasons for this decrease are many including the following:\n\n            - A decrease in mass attacks focusing on infecting computers with spyware, botnet\nagents, cryptominers and adware;\n\n            - A shift from mass-scale attacks to more localized ones, specifically:\n\n`o` A transition from massive phishing campaigns to smaller localized attacks;\n\n`o` A decrease in malicious and infected web resources utilized for large-scale\nmalware spreading;\n\n            - A decrease in machines infected with old self-propagating malware – worms and\nviruses.\n\nAt the same time, threats are becoming more local, targeted and, as a result, more complex\nand less noticeable.\n\n##### Percentage of computers on which malicious objects were blocked\n\nIn H1 2020, malicious objects were blocked on 32.6% of ICS computers – this is lower than\nH2 2019 by 6.6 percentage points.\n\n\n**Percentage of ICS**\n**computers on**\n**which malicious**\n**objects were**\n**blocked**\n\n\nIn H1 2020 the highest percentage of ICS computers on which malicious objects were blocked\nwas recorded in February and the lowest in January.\n\nTHREAT LANDSCAPE FOR INDUSTRIAL AUTOMATION 14\n\n\n-----\n\n**Percentage of ICS**\n**computers on**\n**which malicious**\n**objects were**\n**blocked by month**\n**(January – June**\n**2020)**\n\n\n##### Situation in selected industries \n\n\n**Percentage of ICS**\n**computers on**\n**which malicious**\n**objects were**\n**blocked in selected**\n**industries**\n\n\nDespite the overall tendency for decreasing percentages of attacked computers in H1 2020,\nthe numbers have risen slightly in the Oil & Gas sector, as well as in building automation\nsystems.\n\nComputers in building automation systems are often connected to corporate networks and\nhave access to various services, including the internet, corporate email, domain controllers\nand so forth. In other words, these machines have the same attack surfaces as computers\nin the regular corporate network, and certainly larger when compared to ICS computers.\n\nFor instance, a recent investigation of an attack involving the Snake ransomware showed that\nKaspersky solutions had blocked malware not only in the corporate network of an industrial\nfacility, but also on the video surveillance servers, which were connected to the corporate\ndomain controller.\n\nTHREAT LANDSCAPE FOR INDUSTRIAL AUTOMATION 15\n\n\n-----\n\nBuilding automation systems often belong to contractor organizations and even when these\nsystems have access to the client’s corporate network, they are not always controlled by the\ncorporate information security team. Given that the decrease in mass attacks is offset by an\nincrease in the number and complexity of targeted attacks where we see active utilization of\nvarious lateral movement tools, building automation systems might turn out to be even less\nsecure than corporate systems within the same network.\n\nIn H1 2020 Kaspersky solutions blocked numerous new variants of worms written in script\nlanguages, specifically Python and PowerShell, on computers used for design, maintain and\nautomate industrial systems in the Oil & Gas sector. The surge in these detections occurred\nfrom the end of March to mid-June 2020, mainly in China and the Middle East.\n\nAll of the detected worm samples, both in Python and in PowerShell, are capable of collecting\nauthentication credentials from the memory of system processes on the attacked machines in\norder to spread within the network. In most cases, the malware uses different versions of\nMimikatz to steal authentication credentials from memory. However, there were some\nPowerShell samples which used the comsvsc.dll system library (MS Windows) to save\na memory dump of the system process in which the malware then searched for authentication\ncredentials.\n\n##### The variety of malware detected\n\nIn H1 2020, Kaspersky security solutions blocked over 19.7 thousand malware modifications\nfrom 4,119 different families on industrial automation systems. We have tracked noticeably\nlarger numbers of families in the following categories: backdoor, spyware, Win32 exploits and\n.NET malware.\n\n##### Malicious object categories\n\nThe malicious objects blocked by Kaspersky solutions fall into many different categories.\nTo give a better idea of the types of threats blocked by Kaspersky products, we conducted\na detailed classification. Note that the resulting percentages should not be summed up\nbecause in many cases threats of two or more types may have been blocked on a single\ncomputer during the given reporting period.\n\nThe results of our detailed analysis revealed the following estimated percentages of ICS\ncomputers on which the activity of malicious objects from different categories had been\nprevented:\n\nTHREAT LANDSCAPE FOR INDUSTRIAL AUTOMATION 16\n\n\n-----\n\n**Percentage of ICS computers on which the activity of malicious objects was prevented by malware class**\n\n              - 11.0% – blacklisted internet resources.\n\nWeb-antivirus protects a computer when programs installed on it (browsers, email\nclients, automatic application update modules and others) attempt to connect to\nblacklisted IP addresses and URLs. Such web resources are associated in some\nway with distributing or controlling malware.\n\nSpecifically, blacklisted resources include, among others, those used to distribute\nsuch malware as Trojan-Spy or ransomware disguised as utilities for cracking or\nresetting passwords on controllers of various manufacturers, or as cracks/patches\nfor industrial and engineering software used in industrial networks.\n\n              - 6.5% – malicious scripts and redirects on web resources (JS and HTML) executed\nin the context of the browser, as well as browser exploits – 0.2%.\n\n              - 5.6% – Spy Trojans, backdoors and keyloggers, which appear in numerous\nphishing emails sent to industrial enterprises. As a rule, the ultimate goal of such\nattacks is to steal money.\n\n              - 5.1% – worms (Worm), which usually spread via removable media and network\nshares, as well as worms distributed via email (Email-Worm), network\nvulnerabilities (Net-Worm) and instant messengers (IM-Worm).\n\nMost worms are obsolete from the network infrastructure viewpoint. However, there\nare also worms like Zombaque (0.02%) which implement a P2P network\narchitecture allowing threat actors to activate them at any point.\n\n              - 3.2% – Virus class malware.\n\nThese programs include such families as Sality (0.9%), Nimnul (0.6%), and Virut\n(0.4%), which have been detected for many years. Although these malicious\nfamilies are considered obsolete because their command-and-control servers have\nlong been inactive, they usually make a significant contribution to the statistics due\nto their self-propagation and insufficient measures taken to completely neutralize\nthem.\n\nTHREAT LANDSCAPE FOR INDUSTRIAL AUTOMATION 17\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Ransomware\n\n\n\n    - 3.1% – malicious LNK files.\n\nThese files are mainly blocked on removable media. They are part of the\ndistribution mechanism for older families such as Andromeda/Gamarue, Dorkbot,\nJenxcus/Dinihou and others.\n\nThis category also includes a wide variety of LNK files with the CVE-2010-2568\nvulnerability (0.4%), which was first exploited to distribute the Stuxnet worm and\nhas later been exploited to spread many other families, such as Sality,\nNimnul/Ramnit, ZeuS, Vobfus, etc.\n\nToday, LNK files disguised as legitimate documents can be used as part of a\nmultistage attack. They run a PowerShell script that downloads a malicious file.\n\nIn rare cases, the malicious PowerShell script downloads binary code – a specially\ncrafted modification of a passive TCP backdoor from the Metasploit kit – and\ninjects the code into memory.\n\n    - 2.2% – malicious documents (MSOffice + PDF) containing exploits, malicious\nmacros or malicious links.\n\n    - 1.5% – malicious files (executables, scripts, autorun.inf, .LNK and others) that run\nautomatically at system startup or when removable media are connected.\n\nThese files come from a variety of families that have one thing in common – autorun.\nThe least harmful functionality of such files is automatically launching the browser\nwith a predefined home page. In most cases, malicious programs that use\nautorun.inf are modifications of malware from old families (Palevo, Sality, Kido, etc.).\n\n    - 1.3% – banking Trojans.\n\n    - 1.2% – web miners running in browsers. 0.9% – miners in the form of executable\nfiles for Windows.\n\n    - 0.9% – malware for AutoCad.\n\nIt is worth noting that malware for AutoCad, specifically viruses, is mainly detected\non computers that are part of industrial networks, including network shares and\nengineering workstations, in East Asia.\n\n    - 0.6% – ransomware.\n\n    - 0.5% – malicious files for mobile devices that are blocked when such devices are\nconnected to computers.\n\nIn H1 2020 ransomware was blocked on 0.63% of ICS computers, which does not differ\nsignificantly from the previous six months (0.61%).\n\nThroughout H1 2020 this number fluctuated between a low of 0.18% in March and a high of\n0.22% in February.\n\n\nTHREAT LANDSCAPE FOR INDUSTRIAL AUTOMATION 18\n\n\n-----\n\n**Percentage of ICS**\n**computers on**\n**which ransomware**\n**was blocked by**\n**month (January –**\n**June 2020)**\n\n\n**Regions ranked by**\n**the percentage of**\n**ICS computers on**\n**which ransomware**\n**was blocked**\n**in H1 2020**\n\n\nSoutheast, South and East Asia led with a noticeable margin in the regional rating by the\npercentage of ICS computers attacked by ransomware.\n\nOver half of the countries in the TOP 15 ranking are Asian. Greece and Belarus are the only\nEuropean countries among the TOP 15 (see below).\n\n\nTHREAT LANDSCAPE FOR INDUSTRIAL AUTOMATION 19\n\n\n-----\n\n**TOP 15 countries**\n**and territories by**\n**percentage of ICS**\n**computers on**\n**which ransomware**\n**was blocked**\n**in H1 2020**\n\n\nRussia is in the middle of the list with 0.46%.\n\n##### Geographical distribution\n\nThe map below shows the percentage of industrial automation systems for each country in\nwhich malicious objects were blocked relative to the total number of these systems in that\ncountry.\n\n\n**Geographical**\n**distribution of**\n**attacks* on**\n**industrial**\n**automation**\n**systems**\n**in H1 2020**\n\n\n\n**_* percentage of ICS computers on which malicious objects were blocked_**\n\nTHREAT LANDSCAPE FOR INDUSTRIAL AUTOMATION 20\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Distribution by country\n\n\n**TOP 15 countries**\n**and territories by**\n**percentage of ICS**\n**computers on**\n**which malicious**\n**objects were**\n**blocked**\n\n\nThe H1 2020 results see China return to one of the top five positions in the ranking for the first\ntime since 2017.\n\nThe most significant increase in the percentage of ICS computers where malicious activity was\nprevented occurred in Greece (by 7.8 p.p.), Thailand (by 6.2 p.p.) and Portugal (by 4.3 p.p.).\n\nThe numbers decreased in the vast majority of countries, most noticeably in South Africa\n(by 19.1 p.p.), Israel (by 12.8 p.p.), Russia (by 13.9 p.p.) and Kuwait (by 10 p.p.). As a result\nKuwait has now even appeared in the list of the 10 most secure countries. It is worth noting\nthat two Eastern European countries are also on this list once again: Czech Republic and\nSlovakia.\n\n\n**10 countries and**\n**territories with the**\n**lowest percentage**\n**of ICS computers**\n**on which malicious**\n**objects were**\n**blocked**\n\n\nTHREAT LANDSCAPE FOR INDUSTRIAL AUTOMATION 21\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Distribution by region\n\nSoutheast Asia, Africa and Central Asia lead in the rating of regions based on the proportion of\nICS computers on which malicious activity was prevented.\n\n\n**Percentage of ICS**\n**computers on**\n**which malicious**\n**objects were**\n**blocked by regions**\n**of the world**\n\n\nEurope, Australia, the United States and Canada are the most secure as usual: the numbers\nin these regions are less than 30%.\n\n##### Threat sources\n\nThe internet, removable media and email continue to be the main sources of threats to\ncomputers in the ICS environment.\n\n\n**Main sources**\n**of threats blocked**\n**on ICS computers***\n\n\n\n**_* percentage of ICS computers on which malicious objects from different sources were blocked_**\n\nIn H1 2020 threats blocked on 16.7% of ICS computers came from the internet. This is 6.4 p.p.\nless than in H2 2019.\n\nTHREAT LANDSCAPE FOR INDUSTRIAL AUTOMATION 22\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Main threat sources: geographical distribution\n\n\n**Main sources**\n**of threats blocked**\n**on ICS computers***\n**by region in**\n**H1 2020**\n\n\n###### Internet\n\n\n\n**_* percentage ICS computers on which malicious objects from different sources were blocked_**\n\nWe need to emphasize that in those regions where the smallest percentages of internet\nthreats were blocked on ICS computers, aka Europe, USA and Canada, and Australia, the\npercentages of threats arriving via email attachments are greater than the percentages of\nthreats borne by removable media. Eastern Europe is the exception where these numbers are\nsimilar.\n\nIn the remaining regions the percentage of ICS computers where threats penetrating when\nremovable media were connected is significantly larger than the percentage of ICS computers\nwhere malicious email attachments were blocked.\n\nThe internet is the main source of threats worldwide. The percentage of ICS computers on\nwhich internet threats were blocked in Northern and Western Europe, Australia and in North\nAmerica is less than 10%. At the same time, this percentage is over 20% in Africa, Southeast\nand Central Asia.\n\n\nTHREAT LANDSCAPE FOR INDUSTRIAL AUTOMATION 23\n\n\n-----\n\n**Regions ranked**\n**by percentage of**\n**ICS computers**\n**on which internet**\n**threats were**\n**blocked**\n\n\nH1 2020 sees Greece and Portugal moving up to the TOP 15 of countries where internet\nthreats were blocked on ICS computers from 29[th] and 33[rd] places, respectively. Thailand is the\nonly other country in the TOP 15 to experience any growth.\n\n\n**Top 15 countries**\n**and territories by**\n**percentage of ICS**\n**computers**\n**on which internet**\n**threats were**\n**blocked**\n\n\n###### Removable media\n\nThe largest percentages of ICS computers where malicious threats were blocked when\nremovable media were connected were in Africa, Southeast, East and South Asia. The\nnumbers remain minimal in Australia, Northern and Western Europe, and North America.\nNote that Eastern Europe is the only region where this percentage increased (by 0.9 p.p.)\nin H1 2020.\n\nTHREAT LANDSCAPE FOR INDUSTRIAL AUTOMATION 24\n\n\n-----\n\n**Regions ranked**\n**by percentage**\n**of ICS computers**\n**on which malware**\n**was blocked when**\n**removable media**\n**were connected to**\n**them**\n\n\n**TOP 15 countries**\n**and territories by**\n**percentage**\n**of ICS computers**\n**on which malware**\n**was blocked when**\n**removable media**\n**were connected**\n\n\nIn H1 2020 Taiwan, Saudi Arabia, and Argentina were ousted by Thailand, Korea and\nKazakhstan in the TOP 15 countries ranked by percentage of ICS computers on which\nmalware was blocked when removable media were connected. Notably, no countries from\nNorth America, Europe and Australia are in the TOP 15 rating at all.\n\nThe percentages have decreased in H1 2020 in all TOP 15 countries except Thailand and\nSouth Korea.\n\nIn H1 2020 Southeast Asia led the rating of regions based on the percentage of ICS\ncomputers on which malicious email attachments were blocked. In addition to the leading\nregion we see an unexpected growth in Australia (by 0.7 p.p.).\n\n\n###### Email clients\n\n\nTHREAT LANDSCAPE FOR INDUSTRIAL AUTOMATION 25\n\n\n-----\n\n**Regions ranked**\n**by percentage**\n**of ICS computers**\n**on which malicious**\n**email attachments**\n**were blocked**\n\n\nTwo European regions – Southern and Eastern – appear in the TOP 5, unlike in the other two\nattack vectors.\n\nThe numbers have increased in seven of the TOP 15 countries ranked by the percentage of ICS\ncomputers on which malicious email attachments were blocked. The most significant changes\nhave occurred in Greece (2.5 p.p.), Peru (2.3 p.p.) and Thailand (1.9 p.p.).\n\nIn H1 2020 we see the percentage of ICS computers on which malicious email attachments\nwere blocked in Slovakia, which had leaped to third place in the TOP 15 in H2 2019, dropping\ndramatically by 8 p.p. We also see a decrease of 4 p.p. in Taiwan and South Africa. It is worth\nnoting that Taiwan, unlike Slovakia and South Africa, stayed in the TOP 15 – in 8[th] place.\n\n\n**TOP 15 countries**\n**and territories by**\n**percentage**\n**of ICS computers**\n**on which**\n**malicioius email**\n**attachments were**\n**blocked**\n\n\nTHREAT LANDSCAPE FOR INDUSTRIAL AUTOMATION 26\n\n\n-----\n\n**Kaspersky Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team (Kaspersky ICS CERT)**\nis a global project of Kaspersky aimed at coordinating the efforts of automation system vendors, industrial facility\nowners and operators, and IT security researchers to protect industrial enterprises from cyberattacks.
