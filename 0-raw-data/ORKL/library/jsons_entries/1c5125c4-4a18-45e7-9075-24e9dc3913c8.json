I explained details of its modular structure and which tricks Emotet uses to\nstay undetected. And of course, I talked about the consequences for defenders. Want more?\n\nCybersecurity: This TA505 threat acteur is active at least since 2014.Thomas Barabosch gives an\noverview of the hacking tools that TA505 currently uses.\n\nThis time I would like to introduce another big threat actor to you: TA505. This is a globally spread\nmalware, which acts mainly out of financial motivation. TA505 has been active since 2014, but we at\nTelekom Security have seen increased activity of this group, especially since the second half of 2019. I\n\n\n-----\n\nwould like to show you which tools TA505 uses in contrast to Emotet to sneak into companies and\norganizations. So, here we go.\n\nAs of February 2020, they are mostly known for Big Game Hunting operations, in which they target\nlarge organizations with their ransomware attacks. This in turn ensures very high ransom payouts,\neasily in the range of six figure Euro amounts. For instance, TA505 targeted the University of Maastricht\n[in December 2019 and demanded 30 bitcoins (BTC), roughly €220,000 at time of valuation, as ransom.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ta505-hackers-behind-maastricht-university-ransomware-attack/)\n[Subsequently, the University of Maastricht took the decision to acquire a decryptor to get back their](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/file/cyberattackresponseumfoxitmanagementsummary05-02-2020enpdf)\ndata.\n\nBig Game Hunting operations can take from a couple of days up to one year. This includes the initial\ncompromise of one or more endpoints in a network, the subsequent network exploration and lateral\nmovement, the takeover of strategic points like domain controllers, and the final deployment of the\nransomware to as many endpoints on the local network as possible.\n\nAs these operations comprise different stages, TA505 utilizes a wide range of hacking tools to\naccomplish their missions. Furthermore, they continuously change and update their toolset. For\ninstance, they added the downloader Get2 and the Remote Access Trojan (RAT) SDBBot to their\nrepertoire of malware in mid-2019. These frequent changes and updates are a major difference to the\ngroup behind Emotet (TA542 / MUMMY SPIDER), whose tools remain unchanged for long periods of\ntime. I [blogged on this group a couple of weeks ago. In this blog article, I will review hacking tools that](https://www.telekom.com/en/blog/group/article/cybersecurity-dissecting-emotet-part-one-592612)\nTA505 is currently using.\n\n## TA505 Packer\n\nBefore we dive into TA505 current tool set, let us first have a look at how these tools are packed. As of\ntime of writing, and at least since the second half of 2019, TA505 utilizes a custom packer to obfuscate\nits tools. While custom packers always mean more work, since they may require manual unpacking of\nthe payload, they are a perfect way to track threat actors.\n\nIn addition to this custom packer, TA505 may pack their tools a second or even a third time with UPX. I\nobserved that TA505 packed their Get2 downloader with one layer of UPX, a second layer of the TA505\npacker, and a final third layer of UPX again (see Hashes in Appendix).\n\nIn a nutshell, the TA505 packer decrypts its payload using simple xor and rol/ror operations and its\n[technical details are well covered by this blog article. There is no need to manually unpack TA505](https://www.goggleheadedhacker.com/blog/post/13)\nbinaries, since Tera0017 published a static unpacker. This unpacker is called TAFOF-Unpacker and it is\n[available on github. As of time of writing, it works with the latest TA505 x86 binaries. Unfortunately,](https://github.com/Tera0017/TAFOF-Unpacker)\nTAFOF-Unpacker does not work for x64 binaries yet. Thorsten Jenke and Daniel Plohmann provided\n[the generic unpacker RoAMer, which is capable of unpacking the latest TA505 x64 binaries.](https://github.com/fkie-cad/RoAMer)\n\n## Let's look behind the packer\n\nNow that we know how TA505 currently packs its tools and how to unpack them, let us have a look\nbehind the curtains and see which tools TA505 is currently using. Throughout the last months, I\nobtained 121 samples that were packed by the TA505 packer. 46 samples are x86 binaries and 75\nsamples are x64 binaries. TAFOF-Unpacker unpacked all x86 binaries and RoAMer unpacked roughly\n80% of all x64 binaries. In the following, I will review the tools that I found in the order of when they are\n\n\n-----\n\ntypically utilized in a Big Game Hunting operation: from the initial malicious document to the final\nransomware. Note that there are some outliers that I will address in this section as well as at the end of\nthis article. A full listing of all samples and their classification can be found in the Appendix.\n\n### The Spam and The Maldocs\n\nTA505 carries out high-volume spam campaigns to gain its initial foothold in an organization. As of\nFebruary 2020, the spam emails come with an HTML redirector attachment, which points to a server\nwith an office / a share-hoster themed domain name.\n\nFigure 1TA505 HTML redirector faking Cloudflare DDoS protection.\n\nThis server typically serves Microsoft Excel documents. These documents include a malicious VBA\nMacro and try to lure the victim to activate Macros.\n\nFigure 2Recent TA505 Excel document convincing the victim to activate Macros.\n\nIf the targeted user enables Macros then the embedded VBA Macro loads either a x86 or x64\nembedded payload. As of February 2020, this is typically the Get2 downloader.\n\n### The Downloader: Get2\n\n[Get2 is a very simple downloader. It has only two objectives. First, it calls home to its Command and](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.get2)\nControl (C2) server and exfiltrates information regarding the victim’s system. This information includes\nthe username, the device name, the Windows version, and the list of running processes. Based on this\ninformation, the C2 server decided to serve another payload to Get2. Second, Get2 executes the\npayload provided by its C2 server. As of February 2020, this is typically the RAT SDBBot.\n\n### Another Downloader: Amadey\n\nEven though Get2 seems to be current downloader, I found one [Amadey dropper sample packed with](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.amadey)\nthe TA505 packer. Amadey is a very simplistic downloader that is sold for $600 in the Russian\ncybercrime underground. There is only one Amadey sample in the corpus that I analyzed. There could\nbe many possible reason for this, which I will address at the end of this article.\n\n### The RAT: SDBBot\n\n[Since September 2019, I have observed SDBBot to be a consistent third stage payload, which Get2](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.sdbbot)\ndownloads. SDBBot is a Remote Administration Tool (RAT) that a human operator utilizes to prepare\nlateral movement.\n\nIts capabilities include, amongst other, execution of further payloads, video recording, enabling of RDP,\nas well as listing, writing, and deleting of files / directories. A good write-up about SDBBot's capabilities\n[can be found here. SDBBot is very prevalent in my data set. A huge share of the x64 samples was](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/ta505-distributes-new-sdbbot-remote-access-trojan-get2-downloader)\nSDBBot, however, there were no x86 samples of SDBBot. This is in line with the market share of 64 bit\nWindows. Another explication could be that x86 SDBBots are packed differently and therefore the data\nset does not comprise any of them.\n\n### Another RAT: FlawedGrace\n\n\n-----\n\n[FlawedGrace is another RAT that was](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.flawedgrace) [first observed in 2017. It seems to be exclusively utilized by](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/servhelper-and-flawedgrace-new-malware-introduced-ta505)\nTA505 at this point in time. In my data set there were only two FlawedGrace samples and dozens of\nSDBBot samples, which may indicate that FlawedGrace was mostly replaced by SDBBot.\n\n### Yet Another RAT: Silence\n\n[Silence is a RAT that is (exclusively) developed and operated by the Silence Group, a presumably](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.silence)\n[Russian cybercrime gang. They carry out attacks against financial organizations. Group-IB pointed out](https://www.group-ib.com/resources/threat-research/silence_2.0.going_global.pdf)\na connection to TA505, stating that the downloader of TA505's RAT FlawedAmmyy and the downloader\nof Silence are similar. Finding Silence packed with the TA505 packer suggests a possible on-going\ncollaboration of these two gangs, although possibly a minor one due to the low sample count of two.\n\n### The Information Stealer: Azorult\n\n[Azorult is a classic information stealer that steals saved passwords, credit card information, and cookies](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.azorult)\nfrom browsers, as well as credentials from a wide range of software such as Filezilla, Microsoft Outlook,\nand Thunderbird. Potential use cases of TA505 could be utilizing stolen credentials for lateral\nmovement, feeding stolen mail account credentials back to the spamming stage, or selling them to the\n[highest bidder. Researchers at Blueliv also observed other information stealer like Predator The Thief in](https://www.blueliv.com/cyber-security-and-cyber-threat-intelligence-blog-blueliv/research/servhelper-evolution-and-new-ta505-campaigns/)\nthe context of TA505.\n\n### The Post-Exploitation Tool: TinyMet\n\nTinyMet is a very small (around 4KB) stager for Metasploit's Meterpreter. Its main objective is to\nestablish a communication channel between the attacker and victim and to execute a file-less payload\n[on the victim's machine.TA505 utilizes TinyMet during the post-exploitation phase in order to deploy](https://twitter.com/VK_Intel/status/1225743594528612354?s=20)\ntheir ransomware Clop.\n\nThe utilization of public Offensive Security Tools (OSTs) by threat actors involved in Big Game Hunting\noperations is a common trend. It is logical since these OSTs provide capabilities that threat actors do\nnot have to build on their own. In addition, many of them are freely available, either as open source\nsoftware or as cracked versions (e.g. Cobalt Strike).\n\n### The Preparation Tool: DeactivateDefender\n\nTA505 proceeds the last stage of rolling out their ransomware by deactivating security tools. The\n[objective is preventing any behavioral analysis from stopping their ransomware and the ongoing](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/clop-ransomware-tries-to-disable-windows-defender-malwarebytes)\nencryption process. The tool DeactivateDefender achieves this by changing Windows Defender related\nregistry keys. In my sample set, I only found several samples that deactivate Windows Defender,\n[though there seem to be variants, which target other security tools like Malwarebytes.](https://twitter.com/VK_Intel/status/1197433423956258816?s=20)\n\n### The Ransomware: Clop\n\n[TA505 finishes its Big Game Hunting operations with their ransomware Clop. At this stage the threat](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.clop)\nactor must be pretty confident that their operation will succeed: strategic points of the target network\nhave been taken over and antivirus software has been disabled. As a consequence, Clop encrypts\nmany, if not all, endpoints of the target network within minutes. From a technical point of view, Clop\n[emerged as a variant of another ransomware called](https://securityboulevard.com/2020/01/clop-ransomware-not-just-a-cryptomix-variant/) [CryptoMix but by now it seems to be developed](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.cryptomix)\nseparately.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this blog article, I have had a look at a partial set of TA505 tools that are currently in use. Note that\n[this is only a snapshot of their toolset. A couple of weeks ago, Blueliv mentioned additional tools like the](https://www.blueliv.com/cyber-security-and-cyber-threat-intelligence-blog-blueliv/research/servhelper-evolution-and-new-ta505-campaigns/)\nRAT ServHelper and a modified TeamViewer client. In general, TA505 continuously replaces parts of\ntheir toolset. They have abandoned many tools and they certainly will abandon at some point the tools I\nobserved. One of TA505 tactics seems to continuously change their tools to evade detection and to\nmake tracking more difficult.\n\nHaving reviewed the tools that are behind the TA505 packer, there are many questions that one now\ncould pose regarding TA505 and this packer: is TA505 one group or several groups? Or is it a group of\nsubgroups that share one packer? Or do they share their packer with affiliated groups like Silence? Or\nis the TA505 packer not exclusive to TA505 and it just another packer sold in the cybercrime\nunderground? I believe that this packer is exclusive to what is publicly tracked as TA505 since the\nmajority of samples are in line with what is publicly tracked as TA505. Only few samples seem to be\noutliers. For instance, the Amadey downloader sample, which could have been an experiment or a\nservice to a client / affiliated group. Otherwise I would have expected to see more samples of this early\nstage tool like in the case of the Get2 downloader. And in the case of the Silence RAT, there seems to\nbe at least some form of cooperation between TA505 and Silence Group. Even though these outliers\nexist, the vast majority of samples falls into the Big Game Hunting category.\n\nAnother question regarding TA505 that may come to one’s mind is whether there is another branch of\n[TA505 that carries out more targeted attacks (e.g. as reported by BlueLiv and by](https://www.blueliv.com/cyber-security-and-cyber-threat-intelligence-blog-blueliv/research/servhelper-evolution-and-new-ta505-campaigns/) [FireEye) or it is the](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/01/stomp-2-dis-brilliance-in-the-visual-basics.html)\nsame group that carries out these attacks. At least the ServHelper RAT that is mentioned in the BlueLiv\nreport (see Appendix) seems not to be packed with the TA505 packer, which is another modus\n[operandi. In fact, FireEye started to track this subset of what is publicly tracked as TA505 as another](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/01/stomp-2-dis-brilliance-in-the-visual-basics.html)\ngroup.\n\n## Appendix\n\n### Hashes of representative
