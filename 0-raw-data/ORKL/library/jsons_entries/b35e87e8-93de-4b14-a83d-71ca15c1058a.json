Denys Iarmak, 32, served as\na high-level hacker, whom the group referred to as a “pen tester,” for FIN7. He was arrested\nin Bangkok, Thailand in November 2019 at the request of U.S. law enforcement.  At the\nsentencing hearing Chief U.S. District Judge Ricardo S. Martinez noted that Iarmak had\nbeen in custody during both the COVID pandemic and now the war in Ukraine. “There is\nsome irony, that the nation you were plundering is now leading an international effort to\nprotect your country, your people, your family.”\n\nIarmak is the third FIN7 member of the group to be sentenced in the United States. On April\n16, 2021, FIN7 member Fedir Hladyr was sentenced to 10 years in prison. On June 24,\n2021, FIN7 member Andrii Kolpakov was sentenced to seven years in custody.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the United States alone, FIN7 successfully breached the computer networks of businesses\nin all 50 states and the District of Columbia, stealing more than 20 million customer card\nrecords from over 6,500 individual point-of-sale terminals at more than 3,600 separate\nbusiness locations. According to court documents, victims incurred enormous costs that,\naccording to some estimates, exceeded $1 billion dollars. Additional intrusions occurred\nabroad, including in the United Kingdom, Australia, and France. Companies that have\npublicly disclosed hacks attributable to FIN7 include such chains as Chipotle Mexican Grill,\nChili’s, Arby’s, Red Robin, and Jason’s Deli.\n\n“Iarmak and his conspirators compromised millions of financial accounts, causing over a\nbillion dollars in losses to Americans and costs to America’s economy,” said Assistant\nAttorney General Kenneth A. Polite, Jr. of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division.\n“Protecting businesses – both large and small – online is a top priority for the Department of\nJustice. We are committed to working with our international partners to hold such cyber\ncriminals accountable, no matter where they live or how anonymous they think they are.”\n\n“Mr. Iarmak was directly involved in designing phishing emails embedded with malware,\nintruding on victim networks, and extracting data such as payment card information,” said\nU.S. Attorney Nicholas W. Brown of the Western District of Washington. “To make matters\nworse, he continued his work with the FIN7 criminal enterprise even after the arrests and\nprosecution of co-conspirators. He and others in this cybercrime group used hacking\ntechniques to essentially rob thousands of locations of multiple restaurant chains at once,\nfrom the comfort and safety of their keyboards in distant countries.”\n\n“This cyber-criminal probed and mapped victims’ networks searching for data to exploit,” said\nSpecial Agent in Charge Donald M. Voiret of the FBI’s Seattle Field Office. “Masquerading as\na legitimate business, the hacking group he belonged to recruited other members to assist\nwith their criminal activities. Thanks to the hard work of law enforcement, this defendant, who\nis responsible for an enormous loss amount, will be spending the next few years in prison.”\n\nAccording to court documents, since at least 2015, members of FIN7 (also referred to as\nCarbanak Group and the Navigator Group, among other names) engaged in a highly\nsophisticated malware campaign to attack hundreds of U.S. companies, predominantly in the\nrestaurant, gambling, and hospitality industries. FIN7 hacked into thousands of computer\nsystems and stole millions of customer credit and debit card numbers that were then used or\nsold for profit. FIN7, through its dozens of members, launched waves of malicious\ncyberattacks on numerous businesses operating in the United States and abroad. To\nexecute its scheme, FIN7 carefully crafted email messages that would appear legitimate to a\nbusiness’ employees and accompanied emails with telephone calls intended to further\nlegitimize the emails. Once a file attached to a fraudulent email was opened and activated,\nFIN7 would use an adapted version of the Carbanak malware, in addition to an arsenal of\nother tools, to access and steal payment card data for the business’s customers. Since 2015,\nmany of the stolen payment card numbers have been offered for sale through online\nunderground marketplaces\n\n\n-----\n\nIarmak was involved with FIN7 from approximately November 2016 through November 2018.\nIarmak frequently used project management software such as JIRA, hosted on private virtual\nservers in various countries, to coordinate FIN7 malicious activity and to manage the\nassorted network intrusions. JIRA is a project management and issue-tracking program used\nby software development teams. JIRA allows team members to create “projects” containing\nposted “issues” under which other team members can make comments and share data.\nUnder each issue, FIN7 members tracked their progress breaching a victim’s security,\nuploaded data stolen from the victim, and provided guidance to each other. As one example,\nIarmak created a JIRA issue, to which he and other members of the cybergroup had access,\nfor a specific victim company, and, on or about March 3, 2017, Iarmak updated that JIRA and\nuploaded data he had stolen from that company. During the course of the scheme, Iarmak\nreceived compensation for his participation in FIN7, which far exceeded comparable\nlegitimate employment in Ukraine. Moreover, FIN7 members, including Iarmak, were aware\nof reported arrests of other FIN7 members, but nevertheless continued to attack U.S.\nbusinesses.\n\nIarmak initially fought extradition but in February 2020 he consented to extradition in a Thai\ncourt. In May 2020 he was transferred to U.S. custody. In November 2021, Iarmak pleaded\nguilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit\ncomputer hacking.\n\nThis case is the result of an investigation conducted by the FBI’s Seattle Cyber Task Force.\nThe Justice Department’s Office of International Affairs, the National Cyber-Forensics and\nTraining Alliance, numerous computer security firms and financial institutions, FBI offices\nacross the nation and globe, as well as a number of international agencies provided\nsignificant assistance. Thailand law enforcement authorities provided significant assistance\nby arresting Iarmak.\n\nThis case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Steven Masada of the Western District\nof Washington and Trial Attorney Anthony Teelucksingh of the Criminal Division’s Computer\nCrime and Intellectual Property Section.\n\nTopic(s):\n\nConsumer Protection\n\nCybercrime\n\nComponent(s):\n\n[USAO - Washington, Western](http://www.justice.gov/usao-wdwa)\nContact:\n\nPress contact for the U.S. Attorney’s Office is Communications Director Emily Langlie at\n(206) 553-4110 or Emily.Langlie@usdoj.gov.\n\n\n-----",
