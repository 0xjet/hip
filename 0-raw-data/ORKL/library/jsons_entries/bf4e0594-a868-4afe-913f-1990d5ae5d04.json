    "plain_text": "# New cyberattacks targeting U.S. elections\n\n**[blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/09/10/cyberattacks-us-elections-trump-biden/](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/09/10/cyberattacks-us-elections-trump-biden/)**\n\nSeptember 10, 2020\n\nIn recent weeks, Microsoft has detected cyberattacks targeting people and organizations\ninvolved in the upcoming presidential election, including unsuccessful attacks on people\nassociated with both the Trump and Biden campaigns, as detailed below. We have and will\ncontinue to defend our democracy against these attacks through notifications of such activity\nto impacted customers, security features in our products and services, and legal and\ntechnical disruptions. The activity we are announcing today makes clear that foreign activity\ngroups have stepped up their efforts targeting the 2020 election as had been anticipated,\n[and is consistent with what the U.S. government and others have reported. We also report](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/item/2139-statement-by-ncsc-director-william-evanina-election-threat-update-for-the-american-public)\nhere on attacks against other institutions and enterprises worldwide that reflect similar\nadversary activity.\n\nWe have observed that:\n\nStrontium, operating from Russia, has attacked more than 200 organizations including\npolitical campaigns, advocacy groups, parties and political consultants\n\n\n-----\n\nZirconium, operating from China, has attacked high-profile individuals associated with\nthe election, including people associated with the Joe Biden for President campaign\nand prominent leaders in the international affairs community\nPhosphorus, operating from Iran, has continued to attack the personal accounts of\npeople associated with the Donald J. Trump for President campaign\n\nThe majority of these attacks were detected and stopped by security tools built into our\nproducts. We have directly notified those who were targeted or compromised so they can\ntake action to protect themselves. We are sharing more about the details of these attacks\ntoday, and where we’ve named impacted customers, we’re doing so with their support.\n\nWhat we’ve seen is consistent with previous attack patterns that not only target candidates\nand campaign staffers but also those they consult on key issues. These activities highlight\nthe need for people and organizations involved in the political process to take advantage of\nfree and low-cost security tools to protect themselves as we get closer to election day. At\nMicrosoft, for example, we offer [AccountGuard threat monitoring,](https://www.microsoftaccountguard.com/en-us/) Microsoft 365 for\nCampaigns and [Election Security Advisors to help secure campaigns and their volunteers.](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/04/02/defending-democracy-program-extended/)\nMore broadly, these attacks underscore the continued importance of work underway at the\nUnited Nations to protect cyberspace and initiatives like the Paris Call for Trust and Security\nin Cyberspace.\n\n**Strontium**\n\nStrontium is an activity group operating from Russia whose activities Microsoft has tracked\n[and taken action to disrupt on several previous occasions. It was also identified in the](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2018/08/20/we-are-taking-new-steps-against-broadening-threats-to-democracy/)\nMueller report as the organization primary responsible for the attacks on the Democratic\npresidential campaign in 2016. Microsoft’s Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) has observed\na series of attacks conducted by Strontium between September 2019 and today. Similar to\nwhat we observed in 2016, Strontium is launching campaigns to harvest people’s log-in\ncredentials or compromise their accounts, presumably to aid in intelligence gathering or\ndisruption operations. Many of Strontium’s targets in this campaign, which has affected more\nthan 200 organizations in total, are directly or indirectly affiliated with the upcoming U.S.\nelection as well as political and policy-related organizations in Europe. These targets include:\n\nU.S.-based consultants serving Republicans and Democrats;\nThink tanks such as The German Marshall Fund of the United States and advocacy\norganizations;\nNational and state party organizations in the U.S.; and\nThe European People’s Party and political parties in the UK.\n\nOthers that Strontium targeted recently include businesses in the entertainment, hospitality,\nmanufacturing, financial services and physical security industries.\n\n\n-----\n\nMicrosoft has been monitoring these attacks and notifying targeted customers for several\nmonths, but only recently reached a point in our investigation where we can attribute the\nactivity to Strontium with high confidence. MSTIC’s investigation revealed that Strontium has\nevolved its tactics since the 2016 election to include new reconnaissance tools and new\ntechniques to obfuscate their operations. In 2016, the group primarily relied on spear\nphishing to capture people’s credentials. In recent months, it has engaged in brute force\nattacks and password spray, two tactics that have likely allowed them to automate aspects of\ntheir operations. Strontium also disguised these credential harvesting attacks in new ways,\nrunning them through more than 1,000 constantly rotating IP addresses, many associated\nwith the Tor anonymizing service. Strontium even evolved its infrastructure over time, adding\nand removing about 20 IPs per day to further mask its activity.\n\nWe are also working with our customers to assist them in proactively hunting for these types\n[of threats in their environments and have published additional detail and guidance on](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/09/10/strontium-detecting-new-patters-credential-harvesting/)\nStrontium activity.\n\n**Zirconium**\n\nZirconium, operating from China, has attempted to gain intelligence on organizations\nassociated with the upcoming U.S. presidential election. We’ve detected thousands of\nattacks from Zirconium between March 2020 and September 2020 resulting in nearly 150\ncompromises. Its targets have included individuals in two categories.\n\nFirst, the group is targeting people closely associated with U.S. presidential campaigns and\ncandidates. For example, it appears to have indirectly and unsuccessfully targeted the Joe\nBiden for President campaign through non-campaign email accounts belonging to people\naffiliated with the campaign. The group has also targeted at least one prominent individual\nformerly associated with the Trump Administration.\n\nSecond, the group is targeting prominent individuals in the international affairs community,\nacademics in international affairs from more than 15 universities, and accounts tied to 18\ninternational affairs and policy organizations including the Atlantic Council and the Stimson\nCenter.\n\nZirconium is using what are referred to as web bugs, or web beacons, tied to a domain they\npurchased and populated with content. The actor then sends the associated URL in either\nemail text or an attachment to a targeted account. Although the domain itself may not have\nmalicious content, the web bug allows Zirconium to check if a user attempted to access the\nsite. For nation-state actors, this is a simple way to perform reconnaissance on targeted\naccounts to determine if the account is valid or the user is active.\n\n**Phosphorus**\n\n\n-----\n\nPhosphorus is an activity group operating from Iran that MSTIC has tracked extensively for\nseveral years. The actor has operated espionage campaigns targeting a wide variety of\norganizations traditionally tied to geopolitical, economic or human rights interests in the\n[Middle East region. Microsoft has previously taken legal action against Phosphorus’](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2019/03/27/new-steps-to-protect-customers-from-hacking/)\ninfrastructure and its efforts late last year to target a U.S. presidential campaign. Last month,\nas part of our ongoing efforts to disrupt Phosphorus activity, Microsoft was again given\npermission by a federal court in Washington D.C. to take control of 25 new internet domains\nused by the Phosphorus. Microsoft has since taken control of these domains. To date, we\nhave used this method to take control of 155 Phosphorus domains.\n\nSince our [last disclosure, Phosphorus has attempted to access the personal or work](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2019/10/04/recent-cyberattacks-require-us-all-to-be-vigilant/)\naccounts of individuals involved directly or indirectly with the U.S. presidential election.\nBetween May and June 2020, Phosphorus unsuccessfully attempted to log into the accounts\nof administration officials and Donald J. Trump for President campaign staff.\n\n**Bolstering Cybersecurity**\n\nWe disclose attacks like these because we believe it’s important the world knows about\nthreats to democratic processes. It is critical that everyone involved in democratic processes\naround the world, both directly or indirectly, be aware of these threats and take steps to\nprotect themselves in both their personal and professional capacities. We report on nationstate activity to our customers and more broadly when material to the public, regardless of\nthe actor’s nation-state affiliation. We are taking extra steps to protect customers involved in\nelections, government and policymaking. We’ll continue to disclose additional significant\nactivity in our efforts to defend democracy.\n\nWe also believe more federal funding is needed in the U.S. so states can better protect their\nelection infrastructure. While the political organizations targeted in attacks from these actors\nare not those that maintain or operate voting systems, this increased activity related to the\nU.S. electoral process is concerning for the whole ecosystem. We continue to encourage\nstate and local election authorities in the U.S. to harden their operations and prepare for\npotential attacks. But as election security experts have noted, additional funding is still\nneeded, especially as resources are stretched to accommodate the shift in COVID-19related voting. We encourage Congress to move forward with additional funding to the states\nand provide them with what they need to protect the vote and ultimately our democracy.\n\nTags: [cyberattacks,](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/tag/cyberattacks/) [cybersecurity,](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/tag/cybersecurity-2/) [Defending Democracy Program,](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/tag/defending-democracy-program/) Election Security\nAdvisors, [ElectionGuard,](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/tag/electionguard/) [Microsoft 365 for Campaigns,](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/tag/microsoft-365-for-campaigns/) [MSTIC,](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/tag/mstic/) [security](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/tag/security-2/)\n\n\n-----",
