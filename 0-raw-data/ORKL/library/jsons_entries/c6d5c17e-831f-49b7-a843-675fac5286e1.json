This marks a significant increase in China-based activity from\nmonths prior, as the majority of observed activity in Q3 was predominantly focused on\nSoutheast and East Asia. The previous “smash-and-grab” type of cyber operations, which\ntypically characterized a majority of pre-2016 PRC espionage cases, appear to have\nceased in favor of much more targeted intrusions focused on specific outcomes.\n\nPrevious operations targeting think tanks resembled the digital equivalents of so-called\nsmash-and-grab robberies: the attackers indiscriminately exfiltrated data, vacuuming up\nwhatever information was available. However, in these most recent incidents, threat actors\nspecifically targeted the communications of foreign personnel involved in Chinese economic\npolicy research and the Chinese economy, as well as users with noted expertise in defense,\ninternational finance, U.S.-Sino relations, cyber governance, and democratic elections.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe majority of these intrusions leveraged the China Chopper webshell and/or credential\nharvesting tools targeting the Microsoft Active Directory infrastructure such as Mimikatz to\ncompromise credentials for lateral movement in victim networks. Typically, the adversary\nalso retrieved second-stage tools from an external staging server. Actors often searched for\nvery specific strings, such as “china”, “cyber”, “japan”, “korea”, “chinese” and “eager lion” —\nthe latter is likely a reference to a multinational annual military exercise held in Jordan.\n\nIn at least two cases, adversaries were observed conducting email directory dumps for a full\nlisting of departments within the victim organizations. Not only does this tactic help refine a\nlist of targeted personnel within the organization, but access to a legitimate email server can\nprovide a platform for conducting future spear-phishing operations. Nearly all the affected\norganizations likely maintain close ties to Western government officials. This makes them\nan attractive target for mounting further attacks against government-supporting sectors,\nsince the intruders can masquerade as trusted sources when sending spear-phishing\nemails.\n\n## PANDA vs. Falcon\n\nAn interesting case study was observed by both CrowdStrike Services and the Falcon\nOverWatch™ managed hunting team in late October 2017, when a China-based adversary\nattempted to compromise the web server of a think tank. The specific target appeared to be\nrelated to an ongoing military research project. As with many of the currently observed\nChinese targeted intrusions, the adversary attempted to use China Chopper for\nreconnaissance and lateral movement after logging in via an account compromised by\nspear phishing. As is prevalent among CrowdStrike customers, webshell blocking was\n[enabled in the Falcon endpoint protection platform, which prevented the actor from using](https://www.crowdstrike.com/endpoint-security-products/falcon-platform/)\nthe webshell to run any commands.\n\nThe operator attempted to access the server using the China Chopper shell for four days in\na row, showing particular dedication to targeting this endpoint. The actor attempted several\n**whoami requests during normal Beijing business hours. On the fourth day, after repeated**\nfailures, subsequent access attempts occurred at 11 p.m. Beijing time. This after-hours\nattempt was likely conducted by a different operator, or possibly someone called in to\ntroubleshoot the webshell. After a quick series of tests, the activity ceased and no attempts\nwere made over the weekend. Except for the 11 p.m. login, the observed activity suggests\nthat the adversary is a professional outfit with normal operating hours and assigned tasks.\n\nOn the following Monday, the actors returned, logging into the same user account and\nattempting a different shell, however, this attempt was also quickly staunched by\nCrowdStrike Services. After being forced out again, the actor appeared to switch tactics and\nreturned via the same account to conduct a SQL injection on the web server. When the\nattempt failed yet again, the user signed out and a separate host began conducting a lowvolume DDoS attack on the think tank’s website.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis case is notable for several reasons. First, the adversary showed a high degree of\npersistence and dedication to compromising the target, over the course of a week. Also,\nthey used a different shell, failed, and then attempted to conduct a SQL attack on the\nserver. While this may not be unusual on its own, the short timeline in which it was carried\nout shows the adversary’s skill at adaptation. The multiple attempts to gain access also\nhighlight the likely importance of the project and/or reveal that the adversary was under\nspecific time constraints.\n\nThe final step of conducting a DDoS attack on the think tank’s site was unusual when\nviewed in the context of an espionage operation. The purpose of the attack is unclear, as it\ndid not appear to benefit the espionage objective. Given the timing and subsequent failures\nat gaining access to what is presumably a high-value target, this DDoS attack could have\nbeen done out of frustration.\n\nThis is believed to be the first time CrowdStrike has observed a China-based adversary\nengaging in a disruptive attack against what was previously (and likely, still is) an espionage\ntarget as a follow-on to normal espionage activities.\n\n## Outlook\n\nChina’s renewed interest in targeting Western think tanks and NGOs is hardly surprising\ngiven President XI Jinping’s call to improve China’s think tanks, a response to myriad new\nstrategic problems facing China as it seeks greater influence as a global player. The\ntargeting of these six organizations may signal a more widespread and active campaign to\ncollect sensitive material and enable future operations. Individuals and enterprises that\nmaintain relationships with Western think tanks and NGOs are advised to take appropriate\nprecautions — system security review, additional user awareness training, and ensuring\ncomprehensive endpoint visibility are critical to identifying and preventing threats from\nadvanced adversaries. The increase in operational tempo by Chinese associated intrusion\nactors that was observed during 2017 is covered in more detail in the upcoming\nCrowdStrike Global Threat Report 2017.\n\nFor more information on CrowdStrike’s threat intelligence services, please\n[visit https://www.crowdstrike.com/endpoint-security-products/falcon-x-threat-intelligence/.](https://www.crowdstrike.com/endpoint-security-products/falcon-x-threat-intelligence/)\n\nRelated Content\n\n\n-----\n\nWho is EMBER BEAR?\n\n\n-----\n\nA Tale of Two Cookies: How to Pwn2Own the Cisco RV340 Router\n\nPROPHET SPIDER Exploits Citrix ShareFile Remote Code Execution Vulnerability CVE-2021-22941 to\nDeliver Webshell\n\n\n-----",
