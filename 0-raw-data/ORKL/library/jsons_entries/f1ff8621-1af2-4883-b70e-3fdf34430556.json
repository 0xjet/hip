The report compares the breakout speeds of Russia, China, North Korea, Iran, and the combined category of global eCrime actors.\"\n\n\nhis year’s Global Threat Report: “Adversary Tradecraft\nand the Importance of Speed,” addresses the quickening\npace and increasing sophistication in adversary tactics,\ntechniques and procedures (TTPs) over the past year —\n\n###### Tand in particular, highlights the critical importance of speed in\n\nstaying ahead of rapidly evolving threats.\n\nLast year, we introduced the concept of “breakout time” — the\nwindow of time from when an adversary first compromises an\nendpoint machine, to when they begin moving laterally across\nyour network. In this year’s report, we were able to provide a\nmore granular examination of breakout time by clocking the\naverage speed of major nation-state actors. The report compares\nthe breakout speeds of Russia, China, North Korea, Iran, and\nthe combined category of global eCrime actors. This and other\nunique insights in the report can help organizations advance their\nresponse objectives, depending on which adversary types they\nare most likely to encounter in the year ahead.\n\nThe report also makes clear — in spite of some impressive\nindictments against several named nation-state actors — their\nactivities show no signs of diminishing. Throughout 2018, eCrime\nand nation-state adversaries collectively upped their game. A\nfew examples:\n\nIn diplomatic channels and the media, several nation-states\ngave lip-service to curbing their clandestine cyber activities,\nbut behind the scenes, they doubled down on their cyber\nespionage operations — combining those efforts with further\nforays into destructive attacks and financially motivated fraud.\n\neCrime actors demonstrated new-found flexibility, forming\nand breaking alliances and quickly changing tactics midcampaign to achieve their objectives. The shifting currents of\nthe underground economy — including the availability of new\nTTPs-for-hire and the fluctuating value of Bitcoin — were all\ncontributing factors.\n\nWe also witnessed an increased focus on “Big Game Hunting,”\nwhere eCrime actors combine targeted intrusions with\nransomware to extract big payoffs from large enterprise\norganizations.\n\n\n-----\n\nFalcon OverWatch\nReport\nInsights gained from\nproactive threat hunting\nconducted in customer\nenvironments where\nFalcon is deployed\n\nCrowdStrike Global\nThreat Report\nGlobal cyberthreat\nintelligence and insights\nfrom the Falcon platform\nand OverWatch\n\n\nCrowdStrike Services\nCyber Intrusion\nCasebook\nInsights from reactive\nIncident response\nengagements involving\nCrowdStrike Services\n\n###### FALCON CLOUD PLATFORM\n\n CROWDSTRIKE’S POWERFUL REPORTS ARE ENABLED BY POWERFUL INSIGHTS\n\nThis report’s findings on adversary tradecraft and speed reflect\nwhat many defenders already know: We are in a veritable “arms\nrace” for cyber superiority.

Absent some of the high-profile events observed in 2017, such\nas WannaCry and NotPetya, headlines in 2018 were defined instead by a\nseries of U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) indictments against individuals\nlinked to named, state-sponsored adversaries. Possibly affected by these\npublic disclosures, ongoing tool development activity and changes in\ntactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) seem to indicate 2018 was a\ntransition year for many adversaries. One thing was clear: Law enforcement\nefforts have not yet halted or deterred nation-state sponsored activities.\n\nNation-state adversaries were continuously active throughout 2018 —\ntargeting dissidents, regional adversaries and foreign powers to collect\nintelligence for decision-makers:\n\nNorth Korea (aka the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, or DPRK)\nremained active in both intelligence collection and currency-generation\nschemes, despite participating in diplomatic outreach.\n\nIran maintained focus on operations against other Middle Eastern and\nNorth African (MENA) countries, particularly regional foes across the\nGulf Cooperation Council (GCC). Additionally, it is suspected that Iranian\nadversaries are developing new mobile malware capabilities to target\ndissidents and minority ethnic groups.\n\nAs for China, CrowdStrike® observed a significant rise in U.S. targeting,\nlikely tied to increased tensions between the two countries.\n\nRussian adversaries were active across the globe in a variety of\nintelligence collection and information operations.\n\nOther nation-state adversaries tracked by CrowdStrike but not prominently\nfeatured in this report include:\n\nAdversaries linked to Pakistan and India maintained an interest in regional\naffairs with a rise in activity on the Indian subcontinent, observed in the\nsummer of 2018.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### The most prominent trend in eCrime for 2018 was the continued rise of “Big Game Hunting,” which combines targeted, intrusion-style TTPs with the deployment of ransomware across a large organization, all in pursuit of a bigger financial payoff.\n\n\nThe Vietnam-based adversary OCEAN BUFFALO appeared to focus on\ndomestic — possibly internal law enforcement — operations; however,\nCrowdStrike has also identified the possible targeting of Cambodia, as\nwell as activity against the manufacturing and hospitality sectors.\n\nRecent technical analysis, as well as the reported zero-day use of CVE2018-8174, suggests the South Korean-based adversary SHADOW\nCRANE continues to actively develop its toolkit. The target scope of\nSHADOW CRANE’s campaigns appears to primarily focus on victims in\nChina, Japan, South Korea, Russia, India and the DPRK — particularly\nthose involved in the government, think tanks, media, academia and nongovernment organization (NGO) sectors.\n\nThe eCrime adversaries tracked by CrowdStrike Intelligence conducted\na variety of criminal operations, including crimeware distribution, banking\nTrojans, ransomware, point of sale compromises and targeted spearphishing campaigns:\n\nThe most prominent trend in eCrime for 2018 was the continued rise of\n“Big Game Hunting,” which combines targeted, intrusion-style TTPs with\nthe deployment of ransomware across a large organization, all in pursuit\nof a bigger financial payoff. BOSS SPIDER (Samas, SamSam), INDRIK\nSPIDER (Dridex) and GRIM SPIDER (Ryuk) all raked in huge profits in\nthese campaigns.\n\nAdditional evidence of a changing eCrime ecosystem came from prolific\nransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) adversary PINCHY SPIDER (GandCrab)\nand the solidification of MUMMY SPIDER (Emotet) as a professional\nmalware distribution operation.\n\nMeanwhile, targeted eCrime adversaries COBALT SPIDER (Cobalt Group)\nand CARBON SPIDER (Carbanak) have remained active, despite arrests\nof individuals linked to their operations.\n\nIn the following sections, the CrowdStrike Intelligence, Falcon OverWatch™\nmanaged hunting and the CrowdStrike Services teams present selected\nanalysis that highlights the most significant events and trends in the past\nyear of cyberthreat activity. Analysis of incidents referenced in this report\ndemonstrates how threat intelligence, proactive hunting and swift proactive\ncountermeasures can provide a deeper understanding of the motivations,\nobjectives and activities of these actors, and how to use that information to\nbetter defend valuable data in the future.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### METHODOLOGY\n\n\nThe information in this report was compiled using the following resources:\n\n###### CROWDSTRIKE INTELLIGENCE\nThe CrowdStrike Intelligence team provides in-depth and historical\nunderstanding of adversaries, their campaigns and their motivations. The global\nteam of intelligence professionals track 116 adversaries of all types, including\nnation-state, eCrime and hacktivist actors. The team analyzes adversary\ntools, tactics and procedures (TTPs) to deliver in-depth, government-grade\nintelligence to enable effective countermeasures against emerging threats.\n\n###### FALCON OVERWATCH\nCrowdStrike Falcon OverWatch provides proactive threat hunting conducted\nby a team of experienced threat hunters providing 24/7 coverage on behalf\nof CrowdStrike customers. In 2018, OverWatch identified and helped stop\nmore than 30,000 breach attempts, employing expertise gained from daily\n“hand-to-hand combat” with sophisticated adversaries. The OverWatch team\nworks to identify hidden threat activity in customers’ environments, triaging,\ninvestigating and remediating incidents in real time.\n\n###### CROWDSTRIKE THREAT GRAPH™\nAs the brains behind the CrowdStrike platform, Threat Graph is a massively\nscalable, cloud-based graph database model custom built by CrowdStrike.\nIt processes, correlates and analyzes petabytes of real-time and historical\ndata collected from over one trillion events per week across 176 countries.\nThe Threat Graph architecture combines patented behavioral pattern\nmatching techniques with machine learning and artificial intelligence to track\nthe behaviors of every executable across CrowdStrike’s global customer\ncommunity. This combination of methodologies enables the identification and\nblocking of previously undetectable attacks, whether or not they use malware.\n\n###### CROWDSTRIKE SERVICES\nThis report references the CrowdStrike Services organization and its\nannual report, the \"CrowdStrike Services Cyber Intrusion Casebook 2018,\"\nwhich recounts real-life client incident response (IR) engagements handled\nby the Services team. In addition to hands-on IR services conducted by\nits team of professional investigators, CrowdStrike Services provides\nproactive services such as cybersecurity maturity assessments, IR policy\nand playbook development, tabletop exercises, red teaming operations\nand compromise assessments. Response and remediation services are\nconducted by highly experienced IR experts who investigate breaches to\ndetermine how attackers accessed a client’s environment; mitigate attacks\nand eject intruders; and analyze attacker actions and provide clients with\nactionable guidance to prevent future adversary access.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### While Chinese-affiliated groups had an average breakout time of four hours, there were groups within China that were considerably faster. Similarly, some criminal groups were extremely fast at breaking out, but the average was dragged down by other groups that were slower.\n\n\n###### BREAKOUT TIME:  METHODOLOGY AND LIMITATIONS OF THE FINDINGS\n\nThe dataset used for producing this year’s breakout time analysis was\nbased on intrusions that occurred during 2018 among the organizations\nCrowdStrike works with. CrowdStrike’s customer base is large and\ndiverse, and represents every major industry, including companies and\ngovernment agencies with deployments across 176 countries. However,\nthis large dataset is not universal, and it is possible that researchers\nlooking at other datasets may arrive at different measurements\nfor breakout time. CrowdStrike researchers were only able to rank\nadversaries for which there was live intrusion data based on their\nvisibility and, therefore, it was impossible to arrive at any conclusions\nabout capabilities for other actors that are also undoubtedly executing\ncyber operations. Hopefully, future reports will be able to expand the list\nof adversaries tracked, as more data on them becomes available.\n\nIt’s important to note that this dataset only incorporated intrusions\nwhere CrowdStrike had confident attribution to a threat actor and\nwhere lateral movement was successful by that actor (vs. where they\nmay have been prevented from moving laterally by the technology or\npeople at the customer site). This likely introduced biases that the\nauthors want to recognize in this report.\n\nIn order to make it easier to draw conclusions from the data, a decision\nwas made to aggregate breakout times across adversaries associated\nwith specific nation-states and across all criminal groups CrowdStrike\nhad detected. This decision entailed some internal debate. On one\nhand, it is easier for people to consume data based on countries, versus\nnumerous nation-state actors that may be affiliated with that country;\non the other hand, you lose some of the information in the average\nmetric around the fact that certain groups within nation-states are\nmore skillful than others. Consider this: While Chinese-affiliated groups\nhad an average breakout time of four hours, there were groups within\nChina that were considerably faster. Similarly, some criminal groups\nwere extremely fast at breaking out, but the average was dragged down\nby other groups that were slower. In the future, CrowdStrike hopes to\nexpand the reporting and provide more granular measurements beyond\njust the averages.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CrowdStrike researchers believe — based on extensive experience and visibility — that as defenders get better at hunting for and identifying intrusions, it has become more important for threat actors to raise their game and try to accomplish their mission as rapidly as possible prior to being detected and thwarted.\n\n\nIt is also important to recognize that not all adversaries may have an\nobjective to be as fast as possible at breaking out. It is possible that for\na certain mission, breakout speed may not be the primary objective, or\nthere may have been a handoff to a different intrusion team following the\ninitial compromise, which can also cause significant delays before lateral\nmovement is accomplished. However, CrowdStrike researchers believe\n— based on extensive experience and visibility — that as defenders\nget better at hunting for and identifying intrusions, it has become more\nimportant for threat actors to raise their game and try to accomplish their\nmission as rapidly as possible prior to being detected and thwarted.\n\nThis ranking is also not necessarily an indication of which adversary\nrepresents the biggest threat. For example, it doesn’t account for volume\nof activity — just their speed of lateral movement within the network.\nSlow adversaries can still cause tremendous damage if they have the\nmotivation to do so.\n\nThere are many different ways to look at the dataset. CrowdStrike has\nattempted to outline some of the assumptions and limitations, but there\nare others that researchers may have not thought of yet. CrowdStrike\nwelcomes constructive feedback from the industry on how to make\nthese measurements better and more actionable in the future. This is\nonly a start, and not the end of these types of exercises, and it is hoped\nthat others will come forward with their own measurements of breakout\ntime by adversaries, as well as perhaps other useful metrics to track and\nmeasure their tradecraft and capabilities.\n\nOne of the most important implications of this data, however, is that it is\nan indication of how fast defenders have to be in order to stop a breach\nfrom one of these adversaries that is likely to target them. They may have\nmore time if they are dealing with a threat actor who tends to be slower\nat lateral movement, but they can’t waste a second when dealing with\nfast-moving actors, such as those affiliated with the Russian government.\nCrowdStrike hopes this research spurs more analysis and evaluation\nabout the implications of tracking breakout time, and how to measure\nsophistication and capabilities of adversary groups.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### NAMING CONVENTIONS\n\nThis report follows the naming conventions instituted by CrowdStrike,\nwhich categorizes adversaries according to their nation-state affiliations\nor motivations (e.g., eCrime or hacktivist). The following is a guide to these\nadversary naming conventions.\n\n**Adversary** **Category or Nation-State**\n\n\n###### SPIDER\n\n CHOLLIMA\n\n JACKAL\n\n TIGER\n\n KITTEN\n\n LEOPARD\n\n PANDA\n\n BEAR\n\n CRANE\n\n BUFFALO\n\n\n###### ECRIME\n\n DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF KOREA (NORTH KOREA)\n\n HACKTIVIST\n\n INDIA\n\n IRAN\n\n PAKISTAN\n\n PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA\n\n RUSSIAN FEDERATION\n\n SOUTH KOREA\n\n VIETNAM\n\n\n-----\n\n|Col1|Col2|Col3|Col4|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|||||\n||t|||\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CROWDSTRIKE THREAT GRAPH\n\nThe CrowdStrike Threat Graph is the brains behind the CrowdStrike Falcon®\nplatform. Falcon endpoint agents are deployed on customer machines in more\nthan 176 different countries and capture more than 240 billion events every 24\nhours — more than the number of tweets Twitter processes in an entire year.\n\nUsing powerful graph analytics to correlate more than a trillion events per\nweek in real time, the Threat Graph draws links between security telemetry\nacross the global CrowdStrike Falcon agent community to immediately detect\nand prevent adversary activity — at scale and with unprecedented speed.\n\n###### THREAT GRAPH DATA\n\nType 2017 2018\n\nEvents per Day 90.1B 240B\n\nPeak Events per Second 1.4M 3.8M\n\nAverage Events per Second 1.0M 3.0M\n\nFigure 1.\n**Percentage of Falcon Agent Coverage by Major Operating System**\n\n**Mac**\n\n**Linux** **2%**\n\n###### 9%\n\n**Windows server**\n\n###### 11%\n\n|THREAT GRAPH DATA|Col2|Col3|\n|---|---|---|\n|Type Events per Day|2017 90.1B|2018 240B|\n|Peak Events per Second|1.4M|3.8M|\n|Average Events per Second|1.0M|3.0M|\n\n\n**Windows desktop**\n\n###### 78%\n\n\n###### PERCENTAGE OF FALCON AGENT COVERAGE BY MAJOR OPERATING SYSTEM\n\n\n-----\n\n###### AN OVERVIEW OF TACTICS  AND TECHNIQUES OBSERVED IN 2018\n\n**The following section of the report contains statistics taken directly from CrowdStrike**\n**Threat Graph telemetry profiling recent attack types and their targets.**\n\n###### BREAKOUT TIME AND LATERAL MOVEMENT SPEED\n\nLast year’s Global Threat Report highlighted an important new metric\nCrowdStrike is tracking — “breakout time” — that measures the speed with\nwhich adversaries accomplish lateral movement in the victim environment\nafter their initial compromise. Breakout time is important because it\nrepresents the time limit for defenders to respond to and contain or\nremediate an intrusion before it spreads widely in their environment and\nleads to a major breach.\n\nFigure 2.\n**Breakout Times by Adversary for 2018**\n\n\n###### 01\n\n 02\n\n\n**0 5 : 0 9 : 0 4**\n\n**0 9 : 4 2 : 2 3**\n\n\n###### 04\n\n\n###### 02\n\n\n-----\n\nThis year, the CrowdStrike team decided to dive deeper into breakout\ntime and calculate it for attributed incidents, to determine the speed of\nmajor adversaries whose intrusions the team attributed in 2018. Speed is\nessential in cybersecurity — for both offense and defense. In many ways, it\nis not the sophistication of the tools — which can be bought or stolen from\nothers — that determines the capability of the adversary, but rather their\noperational tradecraft and how rapidly they can achieve their objectives in a\ntarget network. Figure 2 shows the breakout time of major nation-state and\ncriminal actors, calculated over the course of 2018.\n\nIt is quite remarkable to see that Russia-based threat actors are almost\n8 times as fast as their speediest competitor — North Korea-based\nadversaries, who themselves are almost twice as fast as intrusion groups\nfrom China. While certainly not the only metric to judge sophistication\nby, this ranking by breakout time is an interesting way to evaluate the\noperational capabilities of major threat actors. It is also useful for defenders\nwho want to use it to benchmark the speed of their average time-to-detect,\ntime-to-investigate and time-to-remediate metrics (collectively known as the\n“1-10-60 rule,” these key defensive indicators are explained more fully in the\nGlobal Threat Predictions and Recommendations section). Organizations\ncan adjust their target response times to meet their individual needs, based\nin part on which adversaries types they are most likely to confront in their\ngiven business sector and regional focus.\n\nThe overall average breakout time that CrowdStrike observed in 2018\nacross all intrusions and threat actors was 4 hours 37 mins, a substantial\nincrease from 1 hour and 58 minutes tracked in 2017. A variety of factors\nmay have contributed to this increase, including a rise in intrusions from\nslower-moving adversaries, as well as more organizations deploying nextgeneration endpoint security technologies that are more effective at\ndetecting and stopping intrusions than legacy antivirus.\n\n###### Organizations can adjust their target response times to meet their individual needs, based in part on which adversaries types they are most likely to confront in their given business sector and regional focus.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### BEYOND MALWARE\n\nThe 2018 CrowdStrike telemetry did not show a distinct shift in the balance\nbetween malware and malware-free threats compared to 2017. CrowdStrike\nanalysis continues to identify malware as a dominant method used by\nvarious types of attackers for initial infiltration. The ultimate methods and\nobjectives of malware can range from deploying basic bots for use in\ndenial-of-service campaigns, to more directed objectives such as collecting\ncryptocurrencies through unauthorized mining. Other more nefarious\nmalware, such as the TrickBot banking Trojan, is used to steal login\ncredentials to banking sites.\n\nFigure 3 compares malware and malware-free attacks from the 2018\nCrowdStrike telemetry. The attack types are defined as follows:\n\nMalware attacks: These are simple use cases where a malicious file\nis written to disk and Falcon detects the attempt to run that file, then\nidentifies and/or blocks it.\n\nMalware-free attacks: CrowdStrike defines malware-free attacks as\nthose in which the initial tactic did not result in a file or file fragment being\nwritten to disk. Examples of this include attacks where code executes\nfrom memory or where stolen credentials are leveraged for remote logins\nusing known tools.\n\nFigure 3.\n**Global Malware vs. Malware-Free Attacks**\n\n**Malware-Free**\n\n###### 40%\n\n|Col1|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\n###### MALWARE-FREE ATTACKS BY INDUSTRY\n\nNotable shifts in 2018 versus 2017: The media industry jumped to the top\nof the charts, with approximately 80 percent malware-free attacks, versus\napproximately 64 percent in 2017. In addition, the technology, academic and\nenergy sectors all saw dramatic increases in malware-free attacks in 2018.\n\nFigure 4.\n**Malware-free vs. Malware Attacks by Industry**\n\nMedia\n\nTechnology\n\nAcademic\n\nEnergy\n\nHealthcare\n\nEntertainment\n\nRetail\n\nHospitality\n\nManufacturing\n\nAviation\n\nAutomotive\n\nProfessional Services\n\nTelecommunications\n\nGoverment\n\nFinancial\n\nInsurance\n\nPharmaceutical\n\nOil & Gas\n\nConglomerate\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100\n\nMalware-Free Malware\n\nFigure 4 illustrates the percentage of malware versus malware-free attacks\nby industry sector. Industries at the top of this list — including media,\ntechnology and academic — tend to be more heavily targeted by malwarefree threats and will benefit from aggressively strengthening their defenses\nto address these more sophisticated, modern attacks\n\n\n-----\n\n###### MALWARE-FREE ATTACKS BY REGION\n\nUsing sample groupings from the CrowdStrike Threat Graph, this year’s\nreport includes the types of activity observed using CrowdStrike global\ntelemetry. The data aligns with the types of intrusions that are covered\nelsewhere in this report.\n\n\nFor instance, CrowdStrike Intelligence observed an increase in eCrime\nmalware-based activity in Central and South America. Figure 5, comparing\nmalware versus malware-free attacks per region, shows that a larger\npercentage of malware-based attacks occurred in those same regions, thus\naligning with the findings of the CrowdStrike Intelligence team.\n\nFigure 5.\n**Malware Versus Malware-Free Attacks by Region**\n\n\n100%\n\n|100% 75% 50% 25% 0|Col2|\n|---|---|\n\n\nNorth America Latin America Europe, Middle East & Africa Indo - Pacific\n\n\n-----\n\n###### GLOBAL ATT&CK TECHNIQUE TRENDS\n\nSuccessful cyberattacks do not end with an initial intrusion, regardless of\nwhether they’re perpetrated via malware or malware-free attack vectors.\nEach attack has an ultimate objective, such as theft of data or computing\nresources, and the attack typically requires multiple steps along the way\nto reach that objective. In 2018, the cybersecurity industry saw the rapid\nadoption of the MITRE ATT&CK™ framework to describe the tactics and\ntechniques — from initial access to exfiltration — in a standardized manner.\nCrowdStrike uses MITRE ATT&CK extensively in its telemetry and reporting\nto more completely understand and describe cyberthreats. The following\nsection delves into the types of techniques CrowdStrike observed in its\ntelemetry, and maps them to the ATT&CK framework.\n\nIn 2018, CrowdStrike observed a substantial use of “scripting” techniques\nin attacks, as well as the increased use of techniques intended to hide\nor obscure attacker behaviors. The CrowdStrike team surmises that as\nendpoint protection solutions are becoming increasingly adept at finding\nand stopping malicious behaviors, attackers are forced to incorporate\nsteathier measures into their tradecraft.\n\nFigure 6.\n**Global Prevalence of Attack Techniques[1]**\n\n**Masquerading** **Accessibility Features**\n**Hidden Files**\n\n**PowerShell** **Indicator of Compromise**\n\n**& Directories**\n\n**Account Discovery**\n\n**Process Injection**\n\n**Credential** **Miscellaneous**\n**Dumping**\n\n**Setuid and Setgid**\n\n**Indicator Removal on Host**\n\n###### GLOBAL Exploitation for Client Execution\n\n**Command-LineInterface** **PREVALENCE OF ATTACK** **Other** **Exploit Mitigation**\n\n###### TECHNIQUES\n\n\n**1.

The CrowdStrike team surmises that as\nendpoint protection solutions are becoming increasingly adept at finding\nand stopping malicious behaviors, attackers are forced to incorporate\nsteathier measures into their tradecraft.\n\nFigure 6.\n**Global Prevalence of Attack Techniques[1]**\n\n**Accessibility Features**\n\n**PowerShell** **Indicator of Compromise**\n\n**Account Discovery**\n\n**Process Injection**\n\n**Miscellaneous**\n\n**Setuid and Setgid**\n\n**Indicator Removal on Host**\n\n**Exploitation for Client Execution**\n\n**Other**\n\n**Exploit Mitigation**\n\n**Registry Run Keys / Start Folder**\n\n**Ransomware**\n\n**Data from**\n**Local System**\n\nFigure 6 covers the most prevalent MITRE techniques observed, as well as\nadditional techniques that are specific to the CrowdStrike Falcon platform.\nATT&CK focuses primarily on hands-on adversary techniques and does not\ncover activity favored by eCrime groups such as malware (think Emotet and\nBokBot) and common exploits. Falcon provides protection for the complete\nspectrum of attacks.\n\n\n-----\n\n**2. Includes MITRE ATT&CK**\n**techniques as well as**\n**supplementary CrowdStrike**\n**Falcon techniques. Based on**\n**primary reported technique only.**\n\n\n###### REGIONAL ATT&CK TECHNIQUE TRENDS\n\nCrowdStrike observed significant variations in the attacks seen in different\nregions around the globe (Figure 5). The team believes this is important,\nbecause understanding the techniques most likely to be employed in\nattacks against your organization can help you prioritize investments in\nprevention and detection resources.\n\nFigure 7.\n**Prevalence of Attack Technique by Region[2]**\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Actions involved in discovery are easy to miss, as the attacker is typically using the same standard commands and tools that are often used for legitimate administration purposes.\n\n\n###### OVERWATCH ATT&CK HEAT MAP\n\n[In the Falcon OverWatch 2018 Mid-Year Review report, CrowdStrike](https://www.crowdstrike.com/resources/reports/observations-from-the-front-lines-of-threat-hunting/)\nprovided an adversary technique heat map showing targeted intrusion\nactivity observed during the first half of the year. The heat map included in\nthis report (Figure 8) builds on that previous analysis, displaying technique\nusage OverWatch observed in targeted intrusion cases during the entire\nyear. As compared to the analysis in the Mid-Year Review, there has\nnot been a significant shift in the most common adversary tactics and\ntechniques. However, some key observations from the new OverWatch\nATT&CK heat map include:\n\nA very high prevalence of scripting techniques, including PowerShell,\ncommand-line interface, and related techniques. Once attackers obtain\nan initial foothold, the next steps of discovery, persistence, and lateral\nmovement often require a human touch. This represents a key channel that\ndefenders must monitor for effective protection against today’s threats.\n\nAfter attackers obtain their initial foothold, their first order of business\nis to get oriented within their newly accessed environment before\ndetermining next steps toward their objective. This behavior very\ncommonly shows itself via a wide range of discovery techniques. Actions\ninvolved in discovery are easy to miss, as the attacker is typically using\nthe same standard commands and tools that are often used for legitimate\nadministration purposes. However, watching for unusual clusters of\ndiscovery activities, at unusual times, can lead to success in early\ndetection of malicious actors.\n\nAdversaries are frequently seen using valid account credentials across\nthe attack lifecycle. Credentials are typically obtained via successful\nphishing, brute force or credential dumping methods. Use of multifactor\nauthentication is highly recommended to effectively thwart these\ntechniques.\n\nThe number of techniques listed under Defense Evasion continues to\ngrow, as attackers are forced to adopt more sophisticated techniques in\ntheir attempts to hide from more advanced endpoint protection solutions.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 8.\n**Global MITRE ATT&CK Heat Map[3]**\n\n**Initial Access** **Execution**\n\nDrive-by Compromise AppleScript\n\nExploit Public-Facing Application CMSTP\n\nHardware Additions\n\nReplication Through Removable Media\n\nSpearphishing Attachment\n\nSpearphishing Link\n\nSpearphishing via Service\n\nSupply Chain Compromise\n\nTrusted Relationship\n\nValid Accounts\n\nInstallUtil\n\nLaunchctl\n\nLSASS Driver\n\nMshta\n\nPowerShell\n\nRegsvr32\n\nRundll32\n\nScheduled Task\n\nScripting\n\nSource\n\nTrap\n\nUser Execution\n\n**3.

malware remains a significant component of modern attacks, it\ngenerally comprises only a portion of an overall attack campaign. By putting\nin place measures for comprehensive visibility across the entire spectrum of\nattack tactics, defenses grow more resilient and capable of detecting and\npreventing a complete range of attack techniques, regardless of where in\nthe attack cycle they occur.\n\nUsing MITRE ATT&CK model mapping against CrowdStrike global telemetry,\nCrowdStrike observed a significant use of scripting techniques as well as\nan increase in the use of defense evasion techniques in 2018. Traditional\nmethods of protection, such as relying on hashes and basic file blocking, no\nlonger provide the strongest defense as attackers continue to shift to “living\noff the land” techniques and using common built-in system tools (such\nas PowerShell, Office Document Macros and JavaScript) to achieve their\nobjectives.\n\n|Credential Access|Discovery|Lateral Movement|Collection|Exfiltration|Initial Access|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Account Manipulation|Account Discovery|AppleScript|Audio Capture|Automated Exfiltration|Drive-by Compromise|\n|Bash History|Application Window Discovery|Application Deployment Software|Automated Collection|Data Compressed|Exploit Public-Facing Application|\n|Brute Force|Browser Bookmark Discovery|Distributed Component Object Model|Clipboard Data|Data Encrypted|Hardware Additions|\n|Credential Dumping|File and Directory Discovery|Exploitation of Remote Services|Data from Information Repositories|Data Transfer Size Limits|Replication Through Removable Media|\n|Credentials in Files|Network Service Scanning|Logon Scripts|Data from Local System|Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol|Spearphishing Attachment|\n|Credentials in Registry|Network Share Discovery|Pass the Hash|Data from Network Shared Drive|Exfiltration Over Command and Control Channel|Spearphishing Link|\n|Exploitation for Credential Access|Network Sniffing|Pass the Ticket|Data from Removable Media|Exfiltration Over Other Network Medium|Spearphishing via Service|\n|Forced Authentication|Password Policy Discovery|Remote Desktop Protocol|Data Staged|Exfiltration Over Physical Medium|Supply Chain Compromise|\n|Hooking|Peripheral Device Discovery|Remote File Copy|Email Collection|Scheduled Transfer|Trusted Relationship|\n|Input Capture|Permission Groups Discovery|Remote Services|Input Capture|||\n|Input Prompt|Process Discovery|Replication Through Removable Media||||\n|Kerberoasting|Query Registry|Shared Webroot||||\n|Keychain|Remote System Discovery|SSH Hijacking|Video Capture|||\n|LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning|Security Software Discovery|Taint Shared Content||||\n|Network Sniffing|System Information Discovery|Third-party Software||||\n|Password Filter DLL|System Network Configuration Discovery|Windows Admin Shares||||\n|Private Keys|System Network Connections Discovery|Windows Remote Management||||\n|Securityd Memory|System Owner/User Discovery|||||\n|Two-Factor Authentication Interception|System Service Discovery|||||\n||System Time Discovery|||||\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n###### STATE-SPONSORED ADVERSARIES\n\nIn 2018, CrowdStrike identified state-sponsored (targeted) intrusion activity from\nacross the globe. The following sections provide an overview of observed incidents\nattributed specifically to adversaries in China, Russia, Iran, and the DPRK (Democratic\nPeople’s Republic of Korea, or North Korea). Additionally, CrowdStrike Intelligence\ncontinues to observe activity from the Republic of Korea (RoK, or South Korea),\nVietnam, India, and Pakistan. Of the 81 named state-sponsored targeted intrusion\nadversaries tracked by CrowdStrike Intelligence, 28 were active in 2018. Additional\ncampaigns have been identified that are in the process of being fully or partially\nattributed. In total, the activities summarized below have been assessed as likely statesponsored operations supporting intelligence collection, military requirements and — in\nthe case of certain DPRK operations — currency generation.\n\n###### 2018 STATE-SPONSORED INTRUSIONS AT A GLANCE\n\nFigure 9 provides a snapshot of state-sponsored intrusion incidents\nreported by CrowdStrike Intelligence in 2018.\n\nFigure 9.\n**Reported State-Sponsored Intrusions by Region**\n\n###### OTHER           \n**OCEAN BUFFALO**\n\n\n###### INDIA\n**QUILTED TIGER**\n\n###### SOUTH KOREA\n\n**SHADOW CRANE**\n\n###### RUSSIA\n**FANCY BEAR**\n\n\n###### CHINA\n**GOBLIN PANDA**\n**WICKED PANDA**\n\n###### TARGETED INTRUSIONS BY ADVERSARY 2018\n\nTop Reported\nAdversaries\n\n###### DPRK\n**LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA**\n**RICOCHET CHOLLIMA**\n**VELVET CHOLLIMA**\n###### IRAN�\n**HELIX KITTEN**\n**STATIC KITTEN**\n\n\n-----\n\n###### GLOBAL TREND: STATE-SPONSORED DESTRUCTIVE ACTIVITY\n\nAlthough 2018 lacked the high-profile ransomware and pseudo-ransomware\nincidents, like the WannaCry and NotPetya operations of 2017, CrowdStrike\nIntelligence attributed a number of disruptive incidents to state-sponsored\ntargeted intrusion adversaries.\n\nTable 1.\n**A Summary of Destructive Malware Incidents**\n\n|Adversary STARDUST CHOLLIMA|Malware Dimens MBR Killer|Target Sector Financial|Context The DPRK-based adversary STARDUST CHOLLIMA has been linked with medium confidence to the use of wipers in currency-generation operations targeting the financial sector in Latin America. It is possible these tools were used to destroy forensic evidence and hide the theft of funds.|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|VOODOO BEAR|OlympicDestroyer|Sporting Event|In February 2018, the Russia- based actor VOODOO BEAR deployed a wiper to target organizations associated with the PyeongChang Winter Olympic Games. This activity followed a December 2017 decision by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to ban Russia from competing in the Games.|\n|Possible Iran-Based Adversary|Shamoon|Oil & Gas|In December 2018, CrowdStrike Intelligence reported on the return of the infamous Shamoon wiper. Like previous versions of this attack, the latest incident afef cted oil and gas entities with a nexus to Saudi Arabia.|\n\n\n-----\n\n###### GLOBAL TREND TELECOM-RELATED TARGETING\n\nThroughout 2018, CrowdStrike Intelligence identified several targeted\nintrusion campaigns with a demonstrated focus on the telecommunications\n(telecom) sector, which have manifested as follows:\n\nDirectly targeting organizations in the telecom sector\n\nCompromising vulnerable telecom equipment\n\nUsing lures referencing telecom services\n\nThis trend likely supports state-sponsored espionage actors as they seek to\ngain access to a broad customer base that relies on telecom services.\n\n###### CHINA: EVIDENCE OF UPSTREAM TARGETING\n\nSeveral suspected China-based actor groups were linked to telecom targeting,\nwith some incidents demonstrating a specific interest in using telecom access\nor lures to enable operations against government sector targets in Asia (see\nTable 2). The targeting of the telecom sector is historically within the scope\nof several Chinese adversaries; however, the number of operations affecting\nthis sector, or using lures referencing telecom services, suggests an increase\nin China-based cyber espionage operations on a larger scale, and supports\nprevious assessments that these adversaries regularly engage in upstream\ntargeting. The access gained by compromising entities in the telecom\nsector supports the subsequent targeting of their customers, which include\ngovernment entities. The use of telecom-related lures is almost certainly\nsocially engineered to take advantage of the reliance on communications\ntechnology and the high degree of trust placed in the operators of the\nnetworks that support businesses and government organizations.\n\nTable 2.\n**A Summary of China-Based Activity with Telecom Nexus**\n\n**Campaign** **Targeting** **Telecom Nexus**\n\nCrowdStrike Philippines Lures referencing cybersecurity, information\ncampaign and Vietnam technology, and telecom themes\ntracking: government sector\nRoguePlum\n\nIndustry name: _Unconfirmed, but_ Decoy content related to the International\n“Comnie” reportedly Taiwan, Telecommunication Union (ITU) — a specialized\nSouth Korea, and agency of the United Nations — and a 2018\nTibet conference focusing on submarine cable\n\ninfrastructure\n\nIndustry name: SE Asia Industry reports indicate early 2018 activity targeting\n“Thrip” and the U.S. satellite imagery and communications organizations,\nwith the goal of gaining access to control systems\n\nIndustry name: Central Asia Reports indicate the actor targeted a data center\n“Lucky Mouse” that services a wide range of government assets\n\n|Campaign CrowdStrike campaign tracking: RoguePlum|Targeting Philippines and Vietnam government sector|Telecom Nexus Lures referencing cybersecurity, information technology, and telecom themes|\n|---|---|---|\n|Industry name: “Comnie”|Unconfirmed, but reportedly Taiwan, South Korea, and Tibet|Decoy content related to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) — a specialized agency of the United Nations — and a 2018 conference focusing on submarine cable infrastructure|\n|Industry name: “Thrip”|SE Asia and the U.S.|Industry reports indicate early 2018 activity targeting satellite imagery and communications organizations, with the goal of gaining access to control systems|\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Access to a nationwide telecom provider could support intelligence collection objectives.\n\n\n###### IRAN DIRECTLY TARGETS TELECOM SECTOR\n\nCrowdStrike Intelligence identified two instances of Iranian adversaries\ndirectly targeting the telecom sector in 2018. In June 2018, STATIC\nKITTEN leveraged its bespoke NTSTATS malware against a Saudi Arabiabased telecom company; both Saudi Arabia and the telecom sector are\npart of this adversary’s target scope. Then, in November 2018, Falcon\nOverWatch observed HELIX KITTEN activity at a customer in the telecom\nsector, signaling a shift in the target scope for this adversary. Access\nto a nationwide telecom provider could support intelligence collection\nobjectives, specifically the bulk collection of personally identifiable\ninformation (PII), SMS and call logs, and geolocation data. This operation\ncould also enable the subsequent targeting of the company’s customers,\nand possibly destructive attacks.\n\n###### RUSSIA’S COMPROMISE OF TELECOM EQUIPMENT\n\nIn May 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) issued a press release\ndetailing actions performed by the FBI Cyber Division to disrupt the\nVPNFilter botnet. Both the affidavit and public reporting link VPNFilter to\nRussia’s Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU). VPNFilter largely targeted\nsmall office/home office (SOHO) routers, which which are typically\nvulnerable due to the lack of security updates and/or inconsistent\nmonitoring. The network-sniffing functionality of the malware suggests\nthat it could be used to perform reconnaissance on network nodes\nconnected to infected devices, in preparation for further compromise.\nAlthough not linked to a named Russia adversary, CrowdStrike\nIntelligence assesses that such a use for this malware is consistent with\npreviously observed Russian state-sponsored activity, which has used\nthe compromise of telecom equipment to enable military and intelligence\noperations. For example, in 2017 and 2018, BERSERK BEAR conducted\nreconnaissance and exploitation operations against companies\ndeveloping communications equipment.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n###### CrowdStrike Intelligence has observed an increasing operational tempo from China-based adversaries.\n\n**5. Operations tempo is based on**\n**observed activity and available**\n**reporting. Low tempo may**\n**indicate gaps in this visibility.**\n\n\n###### CHINA\n\nThe downturn in Chinese targeted intrusion activity observed in the\nwake of the 2015 agreement between China and the U.S. with regards to\ncommercially-motivated cyber espionage appears to have been reversed.\nOver the last year, CrowdStrike Intelligence has observed an increasing\noperational tempo from China-based adversaries, which is only likely to\naccelerate as Sino-U.S. relations continue to worsen. In June 2018, the\nTrump administration announced 25 percent tariffs on more than $50\nbillion USD worth of Chinese goods. These tariffs have targeted industries\nsuch as technology, manufacturing and pharmaceuticals in an effort to\ncripple strategic plans laid out in the Chinese government’s Made in China\n2025 Plan (MIC 2025), an initiative that outlines Beijing’s plans to become\na global leader in key manufacturing areas. Many of the strategic goals\noutlined in the plan are likely predicated on specific intelligence collection\nrequirements, which CrowdStrike Intelligence has noted as the primary\nbasis for China-based cyber operations.\n\nAlthough Beijing toned down its rhetoric later in 2018 and reduced mention of\nthe MIC 2025 in state media, these requirements are essential to decreasing\nChinese reliance on critical foreign components — especially in technology,\nenergy, and healthcare — and it is highly unlikely they will be abandoned. Not\nonly does Beijing see decreasing dependence on foreign goods as paramount,\nbut the continuation of its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) seeks to make much of\nthe world’s trade routes and infrastructure dependent on Beijing.\n\nTable 3.\n**A Summary of Observed Chinese Adversary Activity**\n\n|Adversary|Ops Tempo5|Description|\n|---|---|---|\n|GOBLIN PANDA|High|Similar to what was observed in 2017, this adversary continued long-running operations against the government of Vietnam and demonstrated a capability to adopt new TTPs.|\n|WICKED PANDA|High|Within the last year, WICKED PANDA has been linked to numerous incidents involving a broad set of targets, including organizations in the mining, technology, manufacturing, and hospitality sectors. The broad target scope for this adversary group suggests they are contractors supporting high-priority operations as needed.|\n\n\n-----\n\nTable 3. CHINAcont\n\n|Adversary|Ops Tempo|Description|\n|---|---|---|\n|JUDGMENT PANDA|Medium|This adversary is suspected of continuing to target upstream providers (e.g., law firms and managed service providers) to support additional intrusions against high-profile assets. In 2018, CrowdStrike observed this adversary using spear-phishing, URL “web bugs” and scheduled tasks to automate credential harvesting.|\n|KRYPTONITE PANDA|Medium/Low|One of the first observed adopters of the 8.t exploit document builder in late 2017, further KRYPTONITE PANDA activity was limited in 2018. Last known activity for this adversary occurred in June 2018 and involved suspected targeting of Cambodia.|\n|LOTUS PANDA|Medium/Low|In 2018, CrowdStrike observed limited activity from LOTUS PANDA, possibly stemming from public reporting under the industry name “Thrip.” However, evidence suggests this adversary targeted Hong Kong in February, and again in October 2018.|\n|MUSTANG PANDA|Medium/Low|This adversary reappeared in May 2018, retaining an interest in targeting Mongolia, with a focus on the mining sector.|\n|NOMAD PANDA|Medium/Low|In the first quarter of 2018, CrowdStrike Intelligence identified NOMAD PANDA activity targeting Central Asian nations with exploit documents built with the 8.t tool.|\n|STONE PANDA|Low|CrowdStrike Intelligence technical analysis suggests that in mid-2018 this adversary deployed the publicly available QuasarRAT using a custom loader, dubbed StoneNetLoader. In late 2018, STONE PANDA was the subject of public disclosures, both officially in connection to an U.S. DoJ indictment and unofficially from the open-source reporting of IntrusionTruth.|\n|VIXEN PANDA|Low|In November 2018, CrowdStrike Intelligence observed the use of iWebRat, a malware family previously linked to VIXEN PANDA, in an incident that also leveraged a Russian-language decoy document with content related to South and East Asia economic statistics.|\n|EMISSARY PANDA|Unknown|Throughout 2018, CrowdStrike Intelligence observed ongoing targeting of Western think tanks by likely China-based actors. Although attribution for this activity is unconfirmed, some TTPs align with the EMISSARY PANDA actor group.|\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n###### Another campaign has been active throughout 2018 (since at least mid-April) and appears to focus on targeting Ukrainian government, law enforcement and military entities.\n\n\n###### RUSSIA\n\nRussian targeted intrusion activity continued to be prolific in 2018.\nCrowdStrike’s ongoing discovery and analysis of new tools in use by Russiabased adversaries continue to highlight how resourceful and, ultimately,\nhow flexible these actors are against a broad target set. Technical analysis\nof FANCY BEAR and VENOMOUS BEAR tools suggests these adversaries\nare pursuing a plan to diversify their tools. VOODOO BEAR’s 2018 activity\n— although missing the high-profile deployment of ransomware seen in 2017\n— still features the use of destructive and disguised malware.\n\nCrowdStrike Intelligence also tracked suspected Russia-based campaigns,\nincluding the previously mentioned VPNFilter activity that, when combined\nwith attributed targeted intrusion incidents, suggests Russian adversaries\nengaged in even more extensive operations in 2018. Although unattributed\nto a named Russian adversary, these incidents are aligned with strategic\nRussian goals. For example, evidence surfaced in May 2018 that an\nintrusion campaign was targeting entities involved with the analysis of nerve\nagent samples from the Salisbury, England attack on a former Russian\nintelligence officer and his daughter in March 2018 — an attack that was\nlargely attributed to Russian GRU officers and which generated significant\ngeopolitical controversy.\n\nAnother campaign, assessed with medium to high confidence to be\nassociated with Russia-based actors, has been active throughout 2018\n(since at least mid-April) and appears to focus on targeting Ukrainian\ngovernment, law enforcement and military entities. Tracked as SpiceyHoney\nby CrowdStrike Intelligence and known publicly as “Gameredon,” this\noperation makes use of malware called Pteranodon, a new version of\nwhich was observed in November 2018. Ukraine’s SBU has stated that\nSpiceyHoney is a joint operation between Russia’s Federal Security Service\n(FSB) signals intelligence (SIGINT) unit, Center 16, and the Center for\nInformation Security (ISC), also known as Center 18; however, CrowdStrike\nIntelligence has not confirmed this claim.\n\n\n-----\n\n## RUSSIATable 4.\n**A Summary of Observed Russian Adversary Activity**\n\n|Adversary|Ops Tempo|Description|\n|---|---|---|\n|FANCY BEAR|Medium/High|Despite indictments from the U.S. DoJ and other public disclosures released by Western European governments, this adversary has continued to sustain operations targeting government, defense and military sectors of Europe and Eurasia, as well as organizations affiliated with NATO.|\n|VENOMOUS BEAR|Medium|In 2018, German media attributed a 2017 incident targeting the German Foreign Ministry to VENOMOUS BEAR. Additionally, CrowdStrike technical analysis continues to uncover evidence that this adversary maintains an extensive toolset to a malware family, with newly discovered variants showing incremental development over several years, supporting the assessment that this is an established, well-resourced adversary.|\n|BERSERK BEAR|Medium|In late 2018, CrowdStrike sources indicated a long- term reconnaissance and exploitative efof rt against a technology company in Western Europe that produces civil, military and critical infrastructure communications equipment. CrowdStrike Intelligence has assessed that BERSERK BEAR likely maintains a long-term interest in targeting communications technology companies that provide products to support military and defense customers.|\n|VOODOO BEAR|Medium/Low|Following the OlympicDestroyer incident in February 2018, no additional destructive attacks were observed from this adversary in 2018.|\n|COZY BEAR|Low|In November 2018, a widespread spear-phishing campaign was detected by CrowdStrike Falcon OverWatch. CrowdStrike Intelligence has assessed with medium confidence that this campaign is attributed to COZY BEAR.|\n\n\n-----\n\n## RUSSIA\n\n###### EVOLUTION OF VOODOO BEAR\n\nIn February 2018, CrowdStrike reported on a newly identified malware\nfamily dubbed OlympicDestroyer, a destructive tool used against entities\ninvolved in organizing the Olympic Winter Games in PyeongChang. This\nmalware shared technical and operational links with a series of attacks in\n2017 against Ukrainian entities that leveraged ransomware and pseudoransomware as an operational cover for destructive purposes. These\n2017 attacks include use of XDATA, NotPetya, and BadRabbit. Further\nTTP overlaps between these 2017 operations and previous destructive\ncampaigns — specifically the use of the KillDisk wiper in December 2016 —\nhave linked all of these campaigns to the Russia-based adversary VOODOO\nBEAR with medium-high confidence.\n\nUnlike previous activity, which used crimeware as a disguise, VOODOO\nBEAR’s OlympicDestroyer malware featured an apparent attempt to\nadopt some TTPs used by DPRK-associated actors. For example, many\nSTARDUST CHOLLIMA tools are built using an older version of Microsoft\nVisual Studio (MSVS 6), which was also used to build OlympicDestroyer.\nThis technique demonstrates an evolution in the use of attribution fronts to\ninclude a “false flag” style of operation, in which the adversary attempts to\nattach blame for an attack to a third party.\n\nFigure 13.\n**VOODOO BEAR Tools Over Time**\n\n###### DECEMBER 2015\n VOODOO BEAR JUNE 2017\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n###### Earlier in the year, rhetoric and policy decisions by Iranian officials suggest actions directed at the U.S. may be less overt and more likely designed to increase “soft power” influence.\n\n\n###### IRAN\n\nDespite some short-term gaps in attributable incidents this year, Iranbased malicious cyber activity appeared to be fairly constant in 2018 —\nparticularly involving incidents targeting other countries in the MENA region.\nAdditionally, the December 2018 re-emergence of the Shamoon wiper\nshows significant TTP overlap with previously observed Iran-based activity,\nsuggesting that Iran continues to be a destructive threat — not only within\nthe Middle East, but also to companies based in Western countries that may\ndo business or maintain infrastructure in the region. Newly observed efforts\n— including long-running strategic web compromise (SWC) campaigns,\nmobile malware and publicly disclosed information operations on Western\nsocial media platforms — demonstrate that Iranian adversaries are adopting\nnew TTPs. These tactics are being used to conduct cyber espionage\ncampaigns against regional rivals, control dissident activity, and further “soft\nwar” campaigns internationally.\n\nOn May 8, 2018, the U.S. government withdrew from the Joint\nComprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) and re-imposed sanctions that\nhad been previously lifted under the agreement. CrowdStrike detected no\napparent retaliatory attacks against the U.S. specifically; however, it remains\nunclear whether the return of Shamoon is part of a strategy for responding\nto the November 2018 resumption of sanctions targeting Iran’s energy\nsector. Earlier in the year, rhetoric and policy decisions by Iranian officials\nsuggest actions directed at the U.S. may be less overt and more likely\ndesigned to increase “soft power” influence. Iran has also taken defensive\nmeasures to harden domestic networks, promoting a narrative of the\npotential risk of cyberattacks launched by the West.\n\n\n-----\n\n## IRAN\nTable 5.\n**A Summary of Observed Iranian Adversary Activity**\n\n|Adversary|Ops Tempo|Description|\n|---|---|---|\n|HELIX KITTEN|Medium-High|HELIX KITTEN was the most active Iran-based adversary in the past year, sustaining a moderate operations tempo throughout 2018. Saudi Arabia continued to be the primary regional target for this actor, however, the use of Bahrain-themed spear- phishing underscores tensions between Iran and Bahrain.|\n|STATIC KITTEN|Medium|Publicly known as “MuddyWater,” this adversary appeared to be very active in the first quarter of 2018, with intermittent operations through the rest of the year. CrowdStrike Intelligence observed regular development of STATIC KITTEN’s NTSTATS malware, which is delivered by macro- enabled documents. The target scope for this adversary includes MENA and Eastern Europe, as well as India and Pakistan.|\n|FLASH KITTEN|Medium-Low|This suspected Iran-based adversary conducted long-running SWC campaigns from December 2016 until public disclosure in July 2018. Like other Iran-based actors, the target scope for FLASH KITTEN appears to be focused on the MENA region.|\n|CHARMING KITTEN|Low|Although CrowdStrike observed very little CHARMING KITTEN activity in the past year, this adversary was linked in June 2018 to several SWC campaigns that spoofed domains of legitimate websites to redirect visitors to adversary- controlled infrastructure.|\n|MAGIC KITTEN|Unknown|CrowdStrike Intelligence recovered several MAGIC KITTEN-related malware samples within the last year. Given Iran’s emphasis on domestic security, it is possible that this adversary, which has targeted dissidents in the past, remains active.|\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n###### The targeting of the financial sector has been linked to currency generation and economy-bolstering efforts for the Kim regime.\n\n\n###### NORTH KOREA\n\nNeither public disclosure of DPRK-based adversary activity, nor the multiple\ndiplomatic overtures between the DPRK and several countries — including\nthe U.S., China, Russia and South Korea — appear to have decreased the\npace of DPRK malicious cyber activity. In some cases, diplomatic activity\nappeared to motivate an increase in DPRK operations. For example,\npreceding the historic summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and\nDPRK leader Kim Jong-Un, CrowdStrike Intelligence observed an overall\nincrease in targeted intrusion activity associated with adversaries based\non the Korean peninsula, including SILENT CHOLLIMA, LABYRINTH\nCHOLLIMA and VELVET CHOLLIMA.\n\n\nFigure 14.\n**Clustering DPRK Adversaries**\n**Based on Code Blocks**\n\n\nIn 2018, DPRK-based malicious cyber activity supported two primary\ntracks of interest: financial targeting and inter-Korea issues. The targeting\nof the financial sector, largely perpetrated by LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA\nand STARDUST CHOLLIMA, has been linked to currency generation and\neconomy-bolstering efforts for the Kim regime. On the other hand, the longrunning campaigns of VELVET CHOLLIMA and RICOCHET CHOLLIMA\nappear to be focused on acquiring information regarding Korea-related\ndiplomatic concerns, U.S. and South Korean policy decisions, and analysis\non the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.\n\n\n###### STARDUST\n\nJob description\n/ Bitcoin\n\n###### CHOLLIMA\n\ncampaign\n\n###### LABYRINTH\n\nPolish bank CHOLLIMA\nSWC\n\nHWP,\nZipPwdDropper\nand first\nobserved Hawup\n\n###### SILENT (2015) CHOLLIMA\n\nHawup\ntargeting ROK\n(2017)\n\nHTTP / IRC Bot Manuscrypt\nrelating to targeting ROK\nDarkSeoul\n\n\n-----\n\n##### NORTH KOREA\n\nCrowdStrike Intelligence technical analysis is pursuing a code pool theory\nfor DPRK-associated malware, in which CHOLLIMA adversaries are sharing\nbuilding blocks of code that can be used to build a range of toolsets.\nTracking these code blocks, each defined by their individual functions, has\nbuilt a picture of implant clusters. These clusters, when combined with\ntarget scope and use of exploits, can be used to broaden an understanding\nof umbrella industry terms, such as “Lazarus Group” and “HIDDEN COBRA,”\nand to define specific adversaries.\n\nTable 6.\n**A Summary of Observed DPRK Adversary Activity**\n\n**Adversary** **Ops Tempo** **Description**\n\nLABYRINTH High Throughout 2018, LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA\nCHOLLIMA operations regularly targeted the financial sector —\nspecifically entities associated with cryptocurrency\n— with spear-phishing campaigns.

LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA operations regularly\ntargeted the financial sectors — specifically organizations associated\nwith cryptocurrency — using spear-phishing campaigns. These efforts\nleveraged Korean-language Hangul Word Processor (HWP) and Microsoft\nWord document lures to deliver variants of the adversary’s unique malware,\nincluding Hawup, Manuscrypt, WolfRAT, SheepRAT and HtDnDownLoader.\nIn 2018, LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA continued to use job- and cryptocurrencythemed lures, a trend first observed in mid-2017.\n\n\nagainst the DPRK, the need for incoming currency to fulfil these economic\nreform plans are only likely to increase. Previous cyber-enabled criminal\noperations by the DPRK aimed at currency generation have likely been\nviewed as successful by the regime and, as such, will likely continue to be a\npriority in DPRK cyber operations in the near future.\n\nFigure 15.\n**Timeline of STARDUST CHOLLIMA Financial**\n**Sector Targeting**\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n###### ECRIME\n\nThroughout 2018, CrowdStrike Intelligence observed ongoing changes to the\neCrime ecosystem. The most notable trend within the year was the continued rise of\nransomware operations targeting large organizations (aka “Big Game Hunting”). The\nmalware distribution threat MUMMY SPIDER solidified new and existing relationships,\nadopting a more professional cycle of providing support to their customers. PINCHY\nSPIDER, a RaaS (ransomware-as-a-service) operation, also seemed aware of the\nneed to keep customers satisfied by significantly increasing its development cycle in\nthe fall of 2018. Law enforcement actions also affected eCrime actors this year, but in\nthe case of COBALT SPIDER and CARBON SPIDER, these efforts appeared to have\nminimal effect on the overall operations of the groups.\n\nTable 7.\n**A Summary of eCrime Adversary Activity**\n\n**Adversary** **Ops Tempo** **Description**\n\nGRIM High GRIM SPIDER is a sophisticated eCrime group that has been operating Ryuk\nSPIDER ransomware since August 2018.

Often, these sophisticated campaigns\ninclude well-tested reconnaissance, delivery and lateral-movement TTPs.\nThe first ransomware to stake a claim as a Big Game Hunting operation was\nSamas (aka SamSam), which is developed and operated by BOSS SPIDER.\nThis adversary group has consistently targeted companies and government\nentities for high ransom demands since it was first identified in January 2016\nuntil at least late November 2018. In July 2017, INDRIK SPIDER joined the\nmovement toward targeted ransomware with the introduction of BitPaymer,\nwhich reaped profits for this adversary throughout 2018. In August 2018, the\nransomware known as Ryuk was first observed and has netted its operators\n— now tracked by CrowdStrike Intelligence as GRIM SPIDER — a significant\n(and immediate) profit in campaigns targeting large organizations.\n\nFigure 16.\n**Big Game Hunting: Revenues Collected ($M) to Date by Adversary**\n\n\n8\n\n7\n\n6\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n\n###### BIG GAME HUNTING: REVENUES COLLECTED $6.7M\n($M) TO DATE BY ADVERSARY\n\n###### $3.7M $1.5M\n\nINDRIK SPIDER GRIM SPIDER BOSS SPIDER\n\n\nSource:\nEstimates are based on observed payments made to all identified adversary-controlled BTC addresses.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CrowdStrike has assessed that GRIM SPIDER is likely a cell of the threat group WIZARD SPIDER, which operates the TrickBot banking malware.\n\n\n###### NEW TO BIG GAME HUNTING,  GRIM SPIDER MAKES QUICK PROFITS\n\nGRIM SPIDER is a sophisticated eCrime group that has been operating\nRyuk ransomware since August of 2018. Ryuk is derived from the source\ncode of Hermes ransomware, but it has been modified to target large\nenterprises. Previous use of Hermes by DPRK-based actors in currencygeneration operations have complicated attribution assessments in opensource reporting; however, CrowdStrike Intelligence has assessed with\nmedium-high confidence that GRIM SPIDER is a criminal actor based\nin Russia. Since Ryuk’s appearance in August of 2018, the threat actors\noperating it have netted over 695.80 Bitcoin (BTC) across 51 transactions\nwith a current value of $3,660,859.44 USD.\n\nCrowdStrike Services has conducted multiple incident response\nengagements for customers in the healthcare, pharmaceutical, professional\nservices and defense sectors in which the banking Trojan TrickBot —\ndeveloped and operated by WIZARD SPIDER — was identified alongside\nRyuk in the victim environment. The CrowdStrike Intelligence team believes\nthat the initial compromise of the environments was conducted using\nTrickBot, which is typically distributed via spam email but was also observed\nbeing distributed using the Emotet geo-targeting download function. Some\nof TrickBot’s modules (such as pwgrab) could aid in recovering the needed\ncredentials, and the SOCKS module in particular has been observed\ntunneling PowerShell Empire traffic to perform reconnaissance and lateral\nmovement. Based on this analysis, as well as the private nature of WIZARD\nSPIDER’s operations, CrowdStrike has assessed that GRIM SPIDER is likely\na cell of the threat group WIZARD SPIDER, which operates the TrickBot\nbanking malware. This signals a shift in WIZARD SPIDER’s operations, which\npreviously focused primarily on wire fraud.\n\nIn late 2018, Ryuk binaries continued to deviate further from the original\nHermes source code, as GRIM SPIDER often adds and removes\nfunctionality. In November 2018, CrowdStrike Intelligence identified new\nfunctionality added to Ryuk that included an anti-analysis infinite loop; a\nping-like request to an IP address once the encryption process completes;\nand the addition of an appended file extension for encrypted files. Of these\nthree new features, only the file extension is still present in an executable\ncompiled on Dec. 20, 2018.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### INDRIK SPIDER’S MULTIFACETED OPERATIONS\n\nIn March 2018, CrowdStrike Intelligence provided support to an active\nBitPaymer ransomware victim in the manufacturing sector. Information\nobtained during the course of the investigation confirmed that INDRIK\nSPIDER used the Dridex loader module to gain an initial foothold on victim\nnetworks. Previous to 2017, Dridex was observed primarily in banking Trojan\noperations, confirming initial analysis from late 2017 that this adversary has\nexpanded the focus of its operations.\n\nReports of BitPaymer infections, including activity targeting the U.S.\ngovernment sector, continued throughout the summer and into the fall of\n2018. Although CrowdStrike did not directly observe BitPaymer incidents\nduring this time, monitoring payments to known INDRIK SPIDER BTC wallets\nindicated that campaigns continued. In July 2018, CrowdStrike Intelligence\nnoticed a change in the ransom amounts demanded by INDRIK SPIDER.\nPreviously, these averaged between $150,000 and $200,000 USD; however,\namong nine observed payments in July, the lowest amount, based on USD\nvalue, was $40,936.62 USD and the highest was $164,115.79 USD. The\nfact that these demands fell within a much wider range suggests that the\nadversary broadened its target scope to include smaller businesses and\norganizations. Based on observed payments made to all identified adversarycontrolled BTC addresses for BitPaymer, INDRIK SPIDER has so far made a\nUSD total of approximately $1,490,000 (approximately 205 BTC) from this\nransomware.\n\n###### The fact that these demands fell within a much wider range suggests that the adversary broadened its target scope to include smaller businesses and organizations.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### FUTURE OF BOSS SPIDER IS UNCERTAIN\n\nThroughout 2018, CrowdStrike Intelligence tracked BOSS SPIDER as it\nregularly updated Samas ransomware and received payments to known\nBTC addresses. In 2018 alone, BOSS SPIDER netted $3,103,767.77 USD\n(based on BTC to USD value at time of payment) from 402.78 BTC, making\n2018 its most profitable year to date, based on USD return.\n\nTable 8.\n**BOSS SPIDER Total Profits**\n\n**Adversary** **Total Ransom Received** **Total Ransom Received**\n**(USD)** **(BTC)**\n\n2016 $1,030,643.28 1,714.10\n\n2017 $2,573,289.49 1,228.49\n\n2018 $3,103,767.77 402.78\n\n**Total** **$6,707,700.54** **3,345.37**\n\nBased on identified Samas samples, CrowdStrike Intelligence assessed that\nBOSS SPIDER was likely operating campaign cycles every three to four\nweeks, which could suggest the length of time it takes the actor to breach\nthe victim organization and perform the required reconnaissance. This\nconsistent pace of activity came to an abrupt halt at the end of November\n2018 when the U.S. DoJ released an indictment for Iran-based individuals\nFaramarz Shahi Savandi and Mohammad Mehdi Shah Mansouri, alleged\nmembers of the group.\n\nFollowing the release of this indictment, CrowdStrike observed no interaction\nbetween BOSS SPIDER and victims. The last observed payment by a victim\nof Samas ransomware was for 0.081216 BTC (or $343.46 USD) on Dec.\n1, 2018. This payment was made to re-enable the expired payment portal\nassociated with the victim — who was likely compromised on Nov. 17, 2018.\nCrowdStrike Intelligence has identified with medium confidence that the last\nSamas campaign launched by BOSS SPIDER was on Nov. 25, 2018. Artifacts\nfrom campaigns around this time frame confirm that BOSS SPIDER had\nrecently updated its pricing due to the drop in the value of BTC.\n\nThe future of this group going into 2019 remains uncertain. Although there is\nno extradition treaty between Iran and the U.S., the indictment also refers to\ntwo individuals involved in the cashout of ransom payments made to BOSS\nSPIDER BTC wallets. The identification of these individuals has possibly\naffected the monetization of BOSS SPIDER’s operations.\n\n|Adversary|Total Ransom Received (USD)|Total Ransom Received (BTC)|\n|---|---|---|\n|2016|$1,030,643.28|1,714.10|\n|2017|$2,573,289.49|1,228.49|\n|2018|$3,103,767.77|402.78|\n|Total|$6,707,700.54|3,345.37|\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 17.\n**Overlapping eCrime Operations**\n\n\n###### ECRIME ECOSYSTEM\n\nThroughout 2018, CrowdStrike Intelligence has observed increased\ncollaborations between highly sophisticated criminal actors. Notably,\nMUMMY SPIDER has expanded its relationships to support other\nestablished eCrime adversaries such as WIZARD SPIDER (operators of\nTrickBot) and LUNAR SPIDER (operators of BokBot), as well as individual\naffiliates making use of banking Trojan malware such as GootKit, Nymaim,\nGozi ISFB, and earlier in 2018, Panda Zeus. Adversaries compromising\nPoS devices, TINY SPIDER and SKELETON SPIDER, were both linked to\nprevious Dridex infections, suggesting that these actors are possibly buying\naccess acquired by INDRIK SPIDER. Overlaps between TrickBot and Ryuk\nestablished a connection between WIZARD SPIDER and GRIM SPIDER.\nFigure 17 illustrates how MUMMY SPIDER has established operations at the\ncenter of this web of relationships.\n\n###### MUMMY SPIDER\n\n**Emotet**\n\nRansomware Point of Sale Banking Trojan\n\nUsed Service Distributed Same Group / Direct Relationship\n\n\n-----\n\n###### MUMMY SPIDER USES GEO-TARGETING TO SUPPORT  MULTIPLE ECRIME FAMILIES\n\nThroughout 2018, CrowdStrike Intelligence observed evidence that MUMMY\nSPIDER both expanded its customer base and continued to actively develop\nEmotet, making efforts to render the malware more resilient (and thus more\nattractive to potential customers). This activity is in line with the adversary’s\nshift in 2017 from a banking Trojan operation to a crimeware downloader\nservice. Prior to this change, when Emotet was still a banking Trojan,\nMUMMY SPIDER likely operated the botnet for its own criminal operations,\nbut this change suggests that Emotet was not proving profitable as a\nbanking Trojan.\n\nMUMMY SPIDER conducts regular waves of spam campaigns to spread\nEmotet — these campaigns often use general invoicing and payroll themes.\nFollowing infection, Emotet uses geo-targeting to determine which payload\nto deliver to the victim machine. Over the course of the summer, in addition\nto supporting the download of TinyLoader, TrickBot and Panda Zeus,\nCrowdStrike Intelligence observed Emotet infections propagating MUMMY\nSPIDER’s own SMB Spreader to machines in the U.S., Canada, Germany,\nU.K., Japan and Australia. MUMMY SPIDER continued supporting WIZARD\nSPIDER through the latter half of the year, while adding geo-targeting\ndistribution for BokBot (LUNAR SPIDER) and Gozi ISFB. CrowdStrike\nIntelligence also observed INDRIK SPIDER continue its historic relationship\nwith MUMMY SPIDER during 2018, although downloads of Dridex by Emotet\nremain rare.\n\n###### Following infection, Emotet uses geo-targeting to determine which payload to deliver to the victim machine.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n###### PINCHY SPIDER: A RaaS MODEL OPERATION\n\nFirst observed in January 2018, GandCrab ransomware quickly began\nto proliferate and receive regular updates from its developer, PINCHY\nSPIDER, which over the course of the year established a RaaS operation\nwith a dedicated set of affiliates. Up until the release of GandCrab major\nversion 4 in July 2018, PINCHY SPIDER appeared to have a slow release\nrate. However, after July, the actor increased the pace, releasing a new\nminor version every two to three weeks. This acceleration in the pace\nof development appeared to be a response to actions taken by security\nvendors and the release of decryptors.\n\n\nThis development cycle was then paused in late October 2018, following\nthe release of version 5.0.5. PINCHY SPIDER suspended advertisements\nfor the ransomware, while the adversary worked on a major redevelopment\nof the ransomware. Specifically, the adversary stated that it will move from\nusing an RSA key consisting of 2,048 bits to one with 8,192 bits. The threat\nactors have also claimed to be working on creating a new admin panel, an\nauto-launching feature for MimiKatz, and local privilege escalation (LPE) for\nWindows 10 and Windows Servers 2016 and 2019 (specifically leveraging\nCVE-2018-8406 and CVE-2018-8405). Notably, in the same forum post,\nPINCHY SPIDER encouraged its customers to begin targeting larger\ncorporate entities to increase their criminal revenue, which could suggest\nPINCHY SPIDER has set its sights on a Big Game Hunting RaaS enterprise.\n\nThe developer’s release of version 5.1 in December 2018 fell far short\nof these goals, and it was not until the last day of the year that PINCHY\nSPIDER informed customers that it planned to deliver additional upgrades\nto the malware after the new year. At that time, affiliates predominantly used\nversion 5.0.4, likely because this was viewed as the most stable version.\n\n\nFigure 18.\n**Timeline of GandCrab Releases**\n\nMost popular\nversion as of\nyear end\n###### GandCrab Development\n\n VERSION NUMBER\n\n\nDATE OF RELEASE\n\n\n-----\n\n###### THE FALL OF GURU SPIDER  AND THE IMPORTANCE OF REPUTATION\n\nEarly in 2018, CrowdStrike Intelligence observed GURU SPIDER supporting\nthe distribution of multiple crimeware families through its flagship malware\nloader, Quant Loader. However, in mid-May 2018, a key vendor for GURU\nSPIDER was banned from at least one underground forum. The ban was\nassociated with multiple complaints about the group’s recently released\nRAT, dubbed mi.NEXT. According to individuals who purchased the nearly\n$1,000 USD product, it failed to meet the advertised capabilities. Ill will\ntoward the actor was compounded by reports that the seller refused to\nissue refunds for the allegedly faulty tool. By the end of June 2018, this\nvendor was banned from other criminal forums as well.\n\nPrior to this setback, GURU SPIDER had a strong following for many of its\ntools, which included the Madness PRO DDoS botnet, z*Stealer, MKL Pro\nKeylogger and MBS BTC Stealer, in addition to Quant Loader. However,\nby the end of the year, customer support waned. CrowdStrike Intelligence\nno longer observes the use of Quant Loader to facilitate crimeware\ndownloads, suggesting customers have acquired other means to support\nthe distribution of their criminal campaigns. The fall of GURU SPIDER\nunderscores the importance of an adversary’s reputation among other\ncriminal actors. The marketing of malware relies on positive reviews and a\nhistory of good standing in the underground communities in which these\nactors participate.\n\n###### CrowdStrike Intelligence no longer observes the use of Quant Loader to facilitate crimeware downloads, suggesting customers have acquired other means to support the distribution of their criminal campaigns.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### MINEWARE AND CRYPTOCURRENCY TRENDS\n\nCrowdStrike Intelligence has continued to track the effect of fluctuations in\nthe value of cryptocurrencies on eCrime operations. Following a precipitous\nrise in the value of BTC at the end of 2017, established eCrime adversaries\ncontinued to further their efforts to acquire BTC, usually by developing\nand/or incorporating capabilities to target users’ cryptocurrency wallets.\nRansomware operators are also sensitive to the value of cryptocurrencies,\nas many ransom payments are requested in BTC. In November 2018,\nimmediately following a decline in the USD value of BTC, CrowdStrike\nIntelligence observed ransomware operators adjust the cost of decrypting\nper-machine in line with the value of BTC.\n\nMineware (aka cryptojacking), which emerged in full strength during 2017\nand continued to proliferate in 2018, has gone from a trending threat\nto a pervasive one. Mineware tends to focus on mining Monero (XMR)\ncryptocurrency, as it has proven to be the most amenable to CPU mining.\nIn standalone binary form, mineware is often discovered in conjunction with\nother malware on a victim’s network; the presence of it may be indicative of\nlarger network security problems.\n\n###### Mineware (aka cryptojacking), which emerged in full strength during 2017 and continued to proliferate in 2018, has gone from a trending threat to a pervasive one.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### The prevalence of mineware in conjunction with other criminal computer compromises has led law enforcement agencies to respond to this threat.\n\n\n###### SALTY SPIDER TARGETS CRYPTOCURRENCY WALLETS\n\nBeginning in January 2018 and persisting through the first half of the year,\nCrowdStrike Intelligence observed SALTY SPIDER, developer and operator\nof the long-running Sality botnet, distribute malware designed to target\ncryptocurrency users. These tools, like other secondary payloads delivered\nby Sality, have similarities to the Sality malware that indicate they were\nalso developed by SALTY SPIDER. An early tool scans victim machines\nfor the presence of directories associated with Electrum BTC wallets and\nexfiltrates all files in these directories. Another tool queries the clipboard of\nthe targeted machine for strings that match the format of BTC addresses.\nWhen this activity was first observed, it came on the heels of a significant\nincrease in the value of BTC.\n\n###### THE PERVASIVENESS OF MINEWARE\n\nThe criminal use of mineware has become associated with the delivery of\nbinaries, installed via exploitation. In early 2018, the delivery of mineware\nwas combined with other notable TTPs, including supply chain attacks,\nmobile malware and domain-generation algorithms (DGAs). As the year\ncontinued, mineware operators adopted new vulnerabilities, particularly\nthose affecting Drupal, an open-source content management system. The\ncompromise of a large number of vulnerable servers enabled these actors\nto run mineware surreptitiously and on a large scale.\n\nThe prevalence of mineware in conjunction with other criminal computer\ncompromises has led law enforcement agencies to respond to this threat.\nJapan, China, and South Korea all arrested individuals allegedly connected\nto mineware operations in 2018. The technology sector has also adopted\nmeasures to limit users’ exposure to mineware, such as browser-based\nCPU mining like CoinHive. Several web browser ad blockers now blacklist\nmineware-related domains. In April 2018, Google announced that Chrome\nextensions containing mineware would be banned from the Chrome\nWeb Store. Two months later, Apple also updated its guidelines for iOS\napplications to prevent the inclusion of cryptocurrency mining code.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n###### TARGETED ECRIME\n\nConsistent activity observed throughout 2018 demonstrates that CARBON\nSPIDER and COBALT SPIDER are well-established eCrime adversaries,\ncapable of continuing operations despite several arrests of individuals\nlinked to these groups. Additionally, both adversaries developed new\nTTPs and adopted the use of new tools during the year. In July 2018,\nCrowdStrike Intelligence introduced a third targeted eCrime adversary,\nRATPAK SPIDER, following a source-code leak of Pegasus, a malware\nframework used by this group.\n\nTable 9.\n**A Summary of Observed Targeted eCrime Adversaries in 2018**\n\n|Adversary|Ops Tempo|Description|\n|---|---|---|\n|COBALT SPIDER|Medium-High|Throughout 2018, CrowdStrike Intelligence tracked the tool usage of COBALT SPIDER, including the adoption of several exploit document builders — ThreadKit, VenomKit and Taurus — as well as the use of bespoke malware COBINT. This adversary continues to target Russian and Eastern European financial institutions and has expanded its targeting to include Panamanian financial institutions.|\n|CARBON SPIDER|Medium|CARBON SPIDER’s pace of development was steady throughout 2017. This pace was not matched in 2018, based on observable evidence. That said, the adversary switched from using Bateleur to Harpy as a first-stage tool in the April- May 2018 time frame.|\n|RATPAK SPIDER|Low|In July 2018, the source code of Pegasus, RATPAK SPIDER’s malware framework, was anonymously leaked. This malware has been linked to the targeting of Russia’s financial sector. Associated malware, Buhtrap, which has been leaked previously, was observed this year in connection with SWC campaigns that also targeted Russian users.|\n\n\n-----\n\n###### In August 2018, the FBI announced that three individuals connected to CARBON SPIDER were arrested earlier in the year.\n\n\n###### ARREST OF INDIVIDUALS LINKED TO TARGETED ECRIME\n\nOn March 26, 2018, a Europol press release announced the arrest of an\nindividual purported to be the leader of the group behind the Carbanak\n(tracked as part of CARBON SPIDER) and Cobalt Group (likely relating to\nCOBALT SPIDER) malware attacks. The individual was identified as Denis K,\na 34-year old Ukrainian. He is the alleged author of the Carbanak malware,\nwhich CrowdStrike identifies as Sekur, CARBON SPIDER’s primary implant.\nHowever, CrowdStrike Intelligence has assessed that Denis K likely left\nCARBON SPIDER following widespread public reporting of the Russian\nbank campaigns in mid-2015 and continued attacks against Russian and\nEastern European financial institutions in separate activity that CrowdStrike\nIntelligence has attributed with high confidence to COBALT SPIDER.\n\nThis arrest did not appear to have a major impact on COBALT SPIDER\noperations, with additional campaigns identified throughout the summer\nof 2018. The relatively short downtime in COBALT SPIDER’s operations\nsuggests that this is a sophisticated eCrime organization with multiple\nmembers. It is also likely that it has developed contingency plans in case of\nfurther law enforcement action.\n\nCARBON SPIDER also experienced the arrests of alleged members of the\ngroup. In August 2018, the FBI announced that three individuals connected\nto CARBON SPIDER were arrested earlier in the year. The three individuals,\nall Ukrainian nationals, are believed to have held management positions\nwithin the point of sale (POS) subgroup of CARBON SPIDER, which\ntargeted U.S. hospitality and restaurant sectors throughout 2017 and into\n2018. Despite these arrests, CARBON SPIDER continued to operate and\neven introduced a new JavaScript RAT, dubbed Harpy.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### BUSINESS EMAIL COMPROMISE\n\nThroughout 2018, CrowdStrike observed business email compromise (BEC)\nscams affecting organizations across multiple sectors. Sometimes referred\nto as CEO fraud, it often involves an actor sending an email from a spoofed\nor compromised account to the victim company’s financial institution\nrequesting a wire transfer. Once the transfer is sent, the payment details are\nintercepted by the criminals and changed. In other incidents, actors have\ntargeted 401(k) accounts of employees or an institution’s payroll system.\n\nThis activity affects both the targeted organization and the financial\ninstitutions supporting these victims. CrowdStrike Intelligence can confirm\nthat successful fraudulent wire transfers have netted thieves millions of\ndollars, with some attempted transfers reaching the billion-dollar mark. BEC\ncampaigns are often initiated with phishing emails and commodity malware\n— including HawkEye, Agent Tesla, and NanoCore — in order to compromise\nthe organization and gather its sensitive information.\n\nBEC fraud is transnational, which poses some significant challenges in\nsuccessfully combating this threat. The fraud operations are often driven\nby confraternities based in Nigeria, which may target a U.S.-based business\nand then move stolen funds to Mexico, Ireland or China. Nigerian law\nenforcement in particular is challenged by limited resources, and Nigerian\ncriminals often operate in groups or cells in countries outside Africa (e.g.,\nEurope, Asia, and North America), which requires law enforcement agencies\nto partner in takedown operations.\nFigure 19.\n**BEC Global Operations**\n\n\n###### US IRELAND TURKEY CHINA\n\nDestination of\n\nU.S. businesses & UK fraudulent funds & HONG\nare regular targets of BEC Destination of fraudulent funds KONG\noperations. Law Destination\nenforcement of fraudulent\nannounced funds\narrests in efforts\nto combat BEC\nthroughout 2018\n###### MEXICO\nDestination of\nfraudulent funds\n\n###### NIGERIA\nMany\nconfraternities\nare Nigerian in\norigin but\noperate around\nthe world\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n###### CROWDSTRIKE SERVICES  CASE STUDY\n\n\nThe CrowdStrike Services team believes the adversary explored the\nexecutive’s email in search of anything it could monetize. It found its\nopportunity when it happened upon the news that the company was\noutsourcing its payroll.\n\nThe adversary had requested password resets to the third-party\npayment portal for some of the employees, and then intercepted\nthe reset messages before legitimate account owners could see\nthem. Once inside the payment portal, the adversary redirected the\nemployees’ paychecks to an online bank that provides the ability to\nsend money anywhere in the world from an account via gift cards.\n\nCrowdStrike has observed other BEC cases that involved SSO\ncredential theft, but those cases involved only an internal portal. This\nis the first time the team has seen an adversary bold enough to use a\nthird-party portal as part of an attack. Clearly, it was confident in its\nability to intercept communications between the third-party portal and\nemployees with legitimate accounts.\n\nCrowdStrike Services discovered that the survey page used as bait had\nbeen hosted on an unmonitored website operated by a small library\nlocated in the United States. The code was buried deep on the web\nserver, but when attempts were made to retrieve the files to find more\nevidence, it was too late: The library had found the page first and wiped\nthe file.\n\nCrowdStrike, with the permission of the customer, conveyed essential\ndetails of the case to U.S. federal law enforcement. Using these details\nand information about other CrowdStrike cases involving the same\nadversary, federal law enforcement was able to arrest the group that\nwas using this particular set of TTPs.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### COBALT SPIDER was a repeat customer of kit developers, with demonstrated use of ThreadKit and VenomKit.\n\n\n###### COBALT SPIDER’S USE OF BUILDER KITS\n\nExploit document builder kits proved to be very popular in 2018, due in\nlarge part to their ease of integration with secondary payloads, and regular\nreleases of new versions containing exploits for the latest Microsoft Office,\nInternet Explorer and Adobe Flash vulnerabilities. COBALT SPIDER was\na repeat customer of kit developers, with demonstrated use of ThreadKit\nand VenomKit. In May and June 2018, CrowdStrike Intelligence identified\nCOBALT SPIDER malicious RTF documents created via ThreadKit, however,\nthe adversary moved to using VenomKit over the course of the summer.\n\nWhile COBALT SPIDER was not their only customer, the loss of its business\nto competitors may have affected the profits of both ThreadKit and\nVenomKit. CrowdStrike Intelligence observed regular iterations of ThreadKit\nfrom April 2017 until September 2018, after which no further development\nwas identified until very late December 2018 when exploit code for CVE\n2018-15982 was added. Similarly, after a drop in price in November 2018,\nthe vendor of VenomKit announced in December that the kit was no longer\nfor sale. Taurus loader documents, on the other hand, continue to be\nobserved, and CrowdStrike Intelligence expects to see this tool in use in the\nnear-term, at least into early 2019.\n\nIn December 2018, CrowdStrike Intelligence identified evidence that\nCOBALT SPIDER was once again changing its toolset. Malicious\ndocuments, tracked as Aries by CrowdStrike, were distributed using\nhyperlinks embedded within spear-phishing emails targeting Eastern\nEuropean and Panamanian financial institutions.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CrowdStrike Intelligence has tracked Joker’s Stash since late 2014. This entity advertises and sells millions of card records, often for less than $10 USD each.\n\n\n###### CARBON SPIDER MONETIZATION THROUGH JOKER’S STASH\n\nThroughout 2018, CrowdStrike Intelligence observed several large credit\ncard data dumps being sold on criminal marketplaces. One of the most\nprominent “carding shops” was Joker’s Stash. In May 2018, CrowdStrike\nIntelligence confirmed that credit card data obtained in CARBON SPIDER\nintrusions was monetized via the Joker’s Stash carding operation. The theft\nof this specific dataset was enabled by the adversary’s custom malware,\nBateleur. The targeting of PoS terminals and additional TTPs observed\nin the incident are also consistent with CARBON SPIDER. CrowdStrike\nIntelligence has noted an extended time gap between data exfiltration and\nthe advertising of the stolen data via Joker’s Stash. The consistency of this\ntrend suggests that CARBON SPIDER may be using the data themselves\nfirst, or that there is an extended resale chain prior to advertising through\nJoker’s Stash.\n\nCrowdStrike Intelligence has tracked Joker’s Stash since late 2014. This\nentity advertises and sells millions of card records, often for less than $10\nUSD each. The operators of Joker’s Stash advertise on several Russianlanguage underground forums and are not fluent English speakers, so it is\npossible that the operators of Joker’s Stash are of Russian origin. Joker’s\nStash is also known for its operational and communications security\npractices, which eschew frequent underground communication tools such\nas Jabber and ICQ.\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n###### Although mineware may no longer be a rising trend, it is still likely to affect organizations across all sectors and may be observed in conjunction with other crimeware.\n\n\nIn 2019, targeted intrusion adversaries will continue to conduct campaigns\nas part of their nation-state’s national strategies. China, Russia, Iran, and the\nDPRK are seeking geopolitical prominence, both in their respective regions\nand internationally, and they will use their cyber capabilities to attain and\nmaintain situational awareness of their neighbors and rivals. Entities in the\ngovernment, defense, think tank and NGO sectors will continue to be the\ntargets of these operations. These intrusions will likely be supported by the\ntargeting of upstream providers in the telecommunications and technology\n(particularly managed service providers) sectors, and may include supply\nchain compromises, as was observed in 2017.\n\nFor China, interest in regional neighbors will likely support the BRI and\nDigital Silk Road initiatives, the latter furthering the balkanization of the\ninternet. Vietnam and Thailand have already drafted intrusive cybersecurity\nlaws that closely resemble China’s. The spread of such surveillance\nstandards will undoubtedly benefit Chinese adversary groups, many of\nwhich are well-versed in targeting telecom organizations. Russia and Iran\nare also likely to make efforts to control the direction of international policy\nregarding internet use. Both countries continue to pursue efforts to control\ncontent on domestic internet platforms. Actors and organizations in Iran\nand Russia are also likely to continue using information operations (IO)\ncampaigns to support narratives favorable to these countries, regardless of\nthe vigilance of social media companies.\n\nIt remains too early to tell if BOSS SPIDER will return to operations following\nthe DoJ indictment. In the meantime, it is highly likely that other Big Game\nHunting adversaries — INDRIK SPIDER and GRIM SPIDER — will continue\nto operate to their fullest capacity, undeterred by potential law enforcement\nactivity. CrowdStrike Intelligence continues to observe fluctuations in the\neCrime ecosystem; however, it is clear that reputation remains a driving\nfactor among eCrime adversaries. GURU SPIDER’s ruined status is a notable\nexample of how quickly a downfall can occur, while MUMMY SPIDER has\nleveraged its relationships to grow into a formidable force.\n\nAlthough mineware may no longer be a rising trend, it is still likely to affect\norganizations across all sectors and may be observed in conjunction with\nother crimeware. BEC will remain elevated in 2019, as new actor groups\nutilizing these tactics emerge and existing groups develop new TTPs for\ncompromising their victims.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n2018 was another tumultuous year in cybersecurity. Looking forward,\nthere is ample evidence that adversaries will be forced to adapt and\ndeploy stealthier tactics in order to continue their profitable operations,\nprolonging the cybersecurity arms race. CrowdStrike recommends that\nall organizations consider the following measures to help maintain strong\ndefenses in 2019:\n\n\n###### 01\n\n\n###### BASIC HYGIENE STILL MATTERS\n\nThe basics of user awareness, asset and vulnerability management, and\nsecure configurations continue to serve as the foundation for a strong\ncybersecurity program. CrowdStrike recommends that organizations regularly\nreview and improve their standard security controls, including the following:\n\nUser awareness programs should be initiated to combat the continued\nthreat of phishing and related social engineering techniques, such as\n2018’s massive Emotet outbreak.\n\nAsset management and software inventory are crucial to ensuring that\norganizations understand their own footprint and exposure.\n\nVulnerability and patch management can verify that known vulnerabilities\nand insecure configurations are identified, prioritized and remediated.\n\nMultifactor authentication (MFA) should be established for all users\nbecause today’s attackers have proven to be adept at accessing and using\nvalid credentials, leading quickly to deeper compromise — also, MFA makes\nit much more difficult for adversaries to gain privileged access.\n\nIn addition to MFA, a robust privilege access management process\nwill limit the damage adversaries can do if they get in, and reduce the\nlikelihood of lateral movement.\n\nImplement password protection to prevent disabling or uninstalling\nendpoint protection that provides critical prevention and visibility for\ndefenders — also, disabling it is always a high-priority for attackers\nlooking to deepen their foothold and hide their activities.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### 02\n\n 03\n\n 04\n\n\n###### LOOK BEYOND MALWARE:  STRENGTHEN DEFENSES AGAINST MODERN ATTACKS\n\nAs sophisticated attacks continue to evolve, enterprises face much more\nthan just “a malware problem.” Defenders must look for early warning signs\nthat an attack may be underway, such as code execution, persistence,\nstealth, command control and lateral movement within a network.\nContextual and behavioral analysis, when delivered in real time via machine\nlearning and artificial intelligence, effectively detects and prevents attacks\nthat conventional “defense-in-depth” technologies cannot address.\n\n###### SURVIVAL OF THE FASTEST :  ACCEPT THE 1-10-60 CHALLENGE \n\nWith breakout time measured in hours, CrowdStrike recommends that\norganizations pursue the “1-10-60 rule” in order to effectively combat\nsophisticated cyberthreats:\n\nDetect intrusions in under one minute,\n\nPerform a full investigation in under 10 minutes\n\nEradicate the adversary from the environment in under 60 minutes\n\nOrganizations that meet this 1-10-60 benchmark are much more likely to\neradicate the adversary before the attack spreads out from its initial entry\npoint, minimizing impact and further escalation. Meeting this challenge\nrequires investment in deep visibility, as well as automated analysis and\nremediation tools across the enterprise, reducing friction and enabling\nresponders to understand threats and take fast, decisive action.\n\n###### LOOK FOR PARTNERS TO HELP FILL THE TALENT GAP\n\nIt is tempting for organizations to turn primarily to technology to solve\ntheir cybersecurity challenges. Events from 2018 remind us that behind\nevery attack, there is a human adversary who is adept at changing TTPs in\nresponse to technical controls. Defending against these threats ultimately\nrequires effective, dedicated and capable security professionals. The most\ntalented professionals are hard to find, and expensive to keep on staff.\nSuccessful enterprises often look outward for help, partnering with bestin-class external solution providers to help fill critical talent gaps in a costeffective manner.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### ABOUT CROWDSTRIKE\n\nCrowdStrike is the leader in cloud-delivered endpoint protection.\nLeveraging artificial intelligence (AI), the CrowdStrike Falcon® platform\noffers instant visibility and protection across the enterprise and prevents\nattacks on endpoints on or off the network.
