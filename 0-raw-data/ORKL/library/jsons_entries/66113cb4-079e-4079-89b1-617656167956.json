The group, identified as APT27, has been targeting commercial](https://cyware.com/news/new-apt27-cyberespionage-campaign-unveiled-b4ece9b6)\norganizations in Germany.\n\n### HyperBro is the tool\n\n[According to German intelligence agency BfV, the attackers are using HyperBro RAT to](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/german-govt-warns-of-apt27-hackers-backdooring-business-networks/)\nbackdoor targeted networks.\n\nThe RAT acts as an in-memory backdoor with remote administration capabilities.\nThe goal of the campaign seems to be stealing sensitive information and targeting\nvictims' customers in supply chain attacks.\nFurther, they may attempt to infiltrate the networks of corporate customers.\n\n\n-----\n\nMoreover, the intelligence agency has published IOCs and YARA rules to help targeted\nGerman organizations check for infections.\n\n### Understanding APT27 campaigns\n\n[Experts revealed that APT27 has been exploiting flaws in Zoho AdSelf Service Plus](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/german-govt-warns-of-apt27-hackers-backdooring-business-networks/)\nsoftware since March 2021.\n\nFrom March until mid-September, the APT group [used an ADSelfService zero-day](https://cyware.com/news/new-warning-apts-are-targeting-zoho-manageengine-8385bdc8)\n[exploit (CVE-2021-40539), and then switched to exploited an n-day AdSelfService](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-40539)\n[exploit before finally jumping to ServiceDesk flaw (CVE-2021-44077) 25 October](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-use-in-house-zoho-servicedesk-exploit-to-drop-webshells/)\nonward.\nAs per [Palo Alto, the APT group had exploited ManageEngine flaws to deliver web](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/state-hackers-breach-defense-energy-healthcare-orgs-worldwide/)\nshells on critical infrastructure organizations and associated with attacks abusing\n[critical ProxyLogon bugs in March 2021.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/state-hackers-rush-to-exploit-unpatched-microsoft-exchange-servers/)\nThe Palo Alto Networks also noted that APT27 compromised nine organizations from\ncritical sectors around the world, such as healthcare, energy, defense, education, and\ntechnology.\n\nWhile no connection was formed between the RAT and the previous campaigns as of now,\nmore information is awaited.\n\n### Closing thoughts\n\nThe recent warning should be considered serious and targeted organizations are suggested\nto be prepared with countermeasures. Targeted entities should protect their intellectual\ninformation with robust encryption and access systems. Further, make use of provided IOCs\nand YARA rules for better detection.\n\nAPT27 German Organizations HyperBro RAT Zoho ManageEngine\n\n\n-----\n\nPublisher\n\n## Cyware\n\n\n-----",
