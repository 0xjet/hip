It\nalso wipes flash memory, SD/MMC cards, and any virtual block devices it can find, using all\npossible device identifiers.\n\n\"The binary performs an in-depth wipe of the filesystem and various known storage device\nfiles. If the code is running as root, AcidRain performs an initial recursive overwrite and\ndelete of non-standard files in the filesystem,\" SentinelOne threat researchers Juan Andres\nGuerrero-Saade and Max van Amerongen explained.\n\nTo destroy data on compromised devices, the wiper overwrites file contents with up to\n0x40000 bytes of data or uses MEMGETINFO, MEMUNLOCK, MEMERASE, and\nMEMWRITEOOB input/output control (IOCTL) system calls.\n\nAfter AcidRain's data wiping processes are completed, the malware reboots the device,\nrendering it unusable.\n\n## Used to wipe satellite communication modems in Ukraine\n\nBased on the name of the AcidRain binary uploaded to VirusTotal, which could be an\nabbreviation of \"Ukraine Operation,\" SentinelOne said the malware might have been\ndeveloped explicitly for an operation against Ukraine and likely used to wipe modems in the\nKA-SAT cyberattack.\n\n\"The threat actor used the KA-SAT management mechanism in a supply-chain attack to\npush a wiper designed for modems and routers,\" SentinelOne hypothesized.\n\n\"A wiper for this kind of device would overwrite key data in the modem's flash memory,\nrendering it inoperable and in need of reflashing or replacing.\"\n\n[This directly contradicts a Viasat incident report on the KA-SAT incident saying it found \"no](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/viasat-shares-details-on-ka-sat-satellite-service-cyberattack/)\nevidence of any compromise or tampering with Viasat modem software or firmware images\nand no evidence of any supply-chain interference.\"\n\nHowever, Viasat confirmed SentinelOne's hypothesis, saying the data destroying malware\nwas deployed on modems using \"legitimate management\" commands.\n\n\"The analysis in the SentinelLabs report regarding the ukrop binary is consistent with the\nfacts in our report - specifically, SentinelLabs identifies the destructive executable that was\nrun on the modems using a legitimate management command as Viasat previously\ndescribed,\" a Viasat spokesperson told BleepingComputer.\n\n\"We expect we can provide additional forensic details when this investigation is complete.\"\n\n\n-----\n\nThe use of AcidRain to wipe modems was also confirmed by security researcher Ruben\nSantamarta who dumped the flash memory of a SATCOM modem corrupted in the attack\nagainst KA-SAT.\n\nAs SentinelOne says, the destructive pattern observed by Santamarta matches the output\nof AcidRain's overwriting wiper method.\n\n[If you're wondering what that might look like...https://t.co/vbCNsgcwtz](https://t.co/vbCNsgcwtz)\n\n[— J. A. Guerrero-Saade (@juanandres_gs) March 31, 2022](https://twitter.com/juanandres_gs/status/1509552417993539586?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nThe fact that Viasat shipped almost 30,000 modems since the February 2022 attack to\nbring customers back online and continues to even more to expedite service restoration\nalso hints that SentinelOne's supply-chain attack theory holds water.\n\nAs a side note, the IOCTLs used by this malware also match the ones used by the\nVPNFilter malware 'dstr' wiper plugin, a malicious tool attributed to Russian GRU hackers\n[(Fancy Bear or](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fbi-takes-control-of-apt28s-vpnfilter-botnet/) [Sandworm).](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-uk-link-new-cyclops-blink-malware-to-russian-state-hackers/)\n\n## Seventh data wiper deployed against Ukraine this year\n\nAcidRain is the seventh data wiper malware deployed in attacks against Ukraine, with six\nothers having been used to target the country since the start of the year.\n\nThe Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine recently reported that a data wiper it\ntracks as [DoubleZero has been deployed in attacks targeting Ukrainian enterprises.](https://cert.gov.ua/article/38088)\n\nOne day before the Russian invasion of Ukraine started, ESET spotted a data-wiping\n[malware now known as HermeticWiper, that was used against organizations in Ukraine](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-data-wiping-malware-used-in-destructive-attacks-on-ukraine/)\ntogether with [ransomware decoys.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-used-as-decoy-in-data-wiping-attacks-on-ukraine/)\n\n[The day Russia invaded Ukraine, they also discovered a data wiper dubbed IsaacWiper](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-worm-and-data-wiper-malware-seen-hitting-ukrainian-networks/)\nand a new worm named HermeticWizard used to drop HermeticWiper payloads.\n\n[ESET also spotted a fourth data-destroying malware strain they dubbed CaddyWiper, a](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-caddywiper-data-wiping-malware-hits-ukrainian-networks/)\nwiper that deletes user data and partition information from attached drivers and also wipes\ndata across Windows domains it's deployed on.\n\n[A fifth wiper malware, tracked as WhisperKill, was spotted by Ukraine's State Service for](https://cip.gov.ua/ua/news/informaciya-shodo-imovirnoyi-provokaciyi)\nCommunications and Information Protection (CIP), who said it reused 80% of the Encrpt3d\nRansomware's code (also known as WhiteBlackCrypt Ransomware).\n\nIn mid-January, Microsoft [found a sixth wiper now tracked as WhisperGate, used in data-](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-fake-ransomware-targets-ukraine-in-data-wiping-attacks/)\nwiping attacks against Ukraine, disguised as ransomware.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Update: A Viasat spokesperson sent the following statement after the story was published:_\n\nThe facts provided in the Viasat Incident Report yesterday are accurate. The analysis\nin the SentinelLabs report regarding the ukrop binary is consistent with the facts in our\nreport - specifically, SentinelLabs identifies the destructive executable that was run on\nthe modems using a legitimate management command as Viasat previously\ndescribed.\n\nAs noted in our report: \"the attacker moved laterally through this trusted management\nnetwork to a specific network segment used to manage and operate the network, and\nthen used this network access to execute legitimate, targeted management\ncommands on a large number of residential modems simultaneously.\"\n\nAdditionally, we don’t view this as a supply chain attack or vulnerability. As we noted,\n\"Viasat has no evidence that standard modem software or firmware distribution or\nupdate processes involved in normal network operations were used or compromised\nin the attack.\" Further, \"there is no evidence that any end-user data was accessed or\ncompromised.\"\n\nDue to the ongoing investigation and to ensure the security of our systems from\nongoing attack, we cannot publicly share all forensic details of the event. Through\nthis process, we have been, and continue to cooperate with various law enforcement\nand government agencies around the world, who've had access to details of the\nevent.\n\nWe expect we can provide additional forensic details when this investigation is\ncomplete.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[US, EU blame Russia for cyberattack on satellite modems in Ukraine](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-eu-blame-russia-for-cyberattack-on-satellite-modems-in-ukraine/)\n\n[Ukraine warns of “chemical attack” phishing pushing stealer malware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ukraine-warns-of-chemical-attack-phishing-pushing-stealer-malware/)\n\n[Phishing attacks target countries aiding Ukrainian refugees](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/phishing-attacks-target-countries-aiding-ukrainian-refugees/)\n\n[Sandworm hackers fail to take down Ukrainian energy provider](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/sandworm-hackers-fail-to-take-down-ukrainian-energy-provider/)\n\n[Google: Russian phishing attacks target NATO, European military](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/google-russian-phishing-attacks-target-nato-european-military/)\n\n[AcidRain](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/acidrain/)\n[Data-wiper](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/data-wiper/)\n[KA-SAT](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ka-sat/)\n[Malware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/malware/)\n[Ukraine](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/ukraine/)\n[Viasat](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/viasat/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[Sergiu Gatlan](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/sergiu-gatlan/)\n\nSergiu Gatlan is a reporter who covered cybersecurity, technology, Apple, Google, and a\nfew other topics at Softpedia for more than a decade.
