According to the TA, the malware is a new project continuously developed\nand compatible with Android versions up to 13.\n\nThe below figure shows the TAs advertisement on the cybercrime forum.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1 – TA’s Advertisement on the Cybercrime Forum\nIn their advertisement, the TA also included a screenshot of the Nexus panel and a list of its target\napplications, as shown below.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 2 –\n\n\nList of Applications Targeted by Nexus\n\n\n-----\n\nFurther investigations revealed that the Nexus malware was being distributed through phishing pages\ndisguised as legitimate websites of YouTube Vanced. The phishing pages included sites such as\nyoutubeadvanced[.]net and youtubevanvedadw[.]net, among others.\n\nAfter analyzing the Nexus samples obtained from the phishing pages, it was determined that the\n[malware’s code shares similarities with that of S.O.V.A banking trojan, which was first discovered in mid-](https://blog.cyble.com/2021/09/14/deep-dive-analysis-of-s-o-v-a-android-banking-trojan/)\n2021 and specifically designed to target Android devices. This blog provides a detailed technical\noverview of the Nexus Android banking trojan.\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\n APK Metadata Information\n\nApp Name: Youtube Vanced\nPackage Name: com.toss.soda\nSHA256 Hash: 3dcd8e0cf7403ede8d56df9d53df26266176c3c9255a5979da08f5e8bb60ee3f\n\nThe figure 3 shows the metadata information of an application.\n\nFigure 3 – App Metadata Information\nThe figure below shows the application icon and name displayed on the Android device.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 4 – App Icon and Name\n\n## Manifest Description\n\nThe malware requests users for 50 different permissions, which it abuses at least 14. These dangerous\npermissions are listed below.\n\n**Permissions** **Description**\n\nREAD_SMS Access SMSs from the victim’s device.\n\nRECEIVE_SMS Intercept SMSs received on the victim’s device\n\nREAD_CONTACTS Access phone contacts\n\nREAD_PHONE_STATE Allows access to phone state, including the current cellular\nnetwork information, the phone number and the serial number of\nthe phone, the status of any ongoing calls, and a list of any\nPhone Accounts registered on the device.\n\nSEND_SMS Allows an application to send SMS messages.\n\n\n-----\n\nCALL_PHONE Allows an application to initiate a phone call without going\nthrough the Dialer user interface for the user to confirm the call.\n\nWRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE Allows the app to write or delete files in the device’s external\nstorage\n\nDISABLE_KEYGUARD Allows the app to disable the keylock and any associated\npassword security\n\nGET_ACCOUNTS Allows access to the list of accounts in the Accounts Service.\n\nGET_TASKS Allows an application to retrieve information about currently and\nrecently running tasks.\n\nREAD_EXTERNAL_STORAGE Allows an application to read from external storage\n\nREQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES Malicious applications can use this to try and trick users into\ninstalling additional malicious packages.\n\nSYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW Allows an application to show system-alert windows. Malicious\napplications can take over the entire screen of the phone.\n\nWRITE_CONTACTS Allows an application to modify the contact (address) data stored\non your phone\n\nWe observed a defined launcher activity in the malicious app’s manifest file, which loads the application’s\nfirst screen, as shown in the figure below.\n\nFigure 5 – Launcher Activity\nUpon examining the Dex, we found that the components specified in the manifest file were absent. It\nsuggests that the application has been packed.\n\nFigure 6 – Components Defined in Manifest are Missing in the Dex\nAfter being executed, the malware unpacks the IWGFPqP.json file from the assets section of the APK\nfile. The unpacked file is then dropped in the application system folder containing the malicious code.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7 – Malware Drops Unpacked\n\nFile\n\n## Source Code Review\n\nThe malware prompts the user to enable the Accessibility Service upon launching it for the first time.\nOnce the victim grants this permission, the malware exploits the service to automatically approve\nrequested permissions, enable device administration, and initiate keylogging activities.\n\nThe malware operates surreptitiously by establishing a connection to the Command and Control (C&C)\nserver via the following URL: hxxp://5.161.97[.]57:5000. Once connected, it transmits sensitive\ninformation, including Accessibility logs and a roster of installed applications to the C&C server as shown\nin the below figure.\n\nFigure 8 – Malware Sends Installed Applications List to the C&C Server\nUpon receiving the list of installed applications, the command and control (C&C) server verify it against\nthe targeted list of banking applications. If a match is found, the C&C server sends an “enableinject”\ncommand, including the specific application’s package name, as shown in the code snippet below.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 9 –\n\nMalware Received the Command from the C&C Server Based on the Target Application\nUpon receiving the “enableinject” command from the C&C server, the Nexus banking trojan on the\nvictim’s device downloads the HTML injection code for the targeted application based on the package\nname received. The downloaded HTML injection code is essentially a phishing page for the specific\nbanking application, which is launched in the WebView interface whenever the victim interacts with the\ntargeted applications. By utilizing this injection technique, the TA can easily obtain the targeted banking\napplication credentials.\n\nThe below image shows the code of Nexus malware downloading HTML phishing pages.\n\nFigure 10 – Malware downloading Phishing HTML pages from C&C Server\nThe table below depicts the package names of the banking applications that Nexus explicitly targets.\n\ntr.com.sekerbilisim.mbank\n\nfinansbank.enpara\n\ncom.ziraat.ziraatmobil\n\ncom.ykb.android\n\ncom.vakifbank.mobile\n\ncom.tmobtech.halkbank\n\ncom.teb\n\n\n-----\n\ncom.pttfinans\n\ncom.pozitron.iscep\n\ncom.mobillium.papara\n\ncom.kuveytturk.mobil\n\ncom.ingbanktr.ingmobil\n\ncom.htsu.hsbepersonalbanking\n\ncom.garanti.cepsubesi\n\ncom.finansbank.mobile.cepsube\n\ncom.denizbank mobildeniz\n\ncom.akbank.android.apps.akbank_direkt\n\napp.wizink.es\n\ncom.imaginbank.app\n\ncom kutxabank.android\n\ncom.cajasur.android\n\ncom.bbva.bbvacontigo\n\ncom.cajaingenieros.android.bancamovil\n\ncom. fibabanka.mobile\n\ncom.bancodebogota.bancamovil\n\nwww. ingdirect.nativeframe\n\ncom.bankinter.launcher\n\ncom.rsi\n\ncom.bbva.netcash\n\nes.bancosantander.apps\n\nes.evobanco.bancamovil\n\ncom.tecnocom.cajalaboral\n\ncom.grupocajamar.wefferent\n\nnet.inverline.bancosabadell.officelocator.android\n\nes.ibercaja.ibercajaapp Banks\n\nes.lacaixa.mobile.android.newwapicon\n\ncom.lynxspa.bancopopolare\n\n\n-----\n\ncom latuabancaperandroid\n\ncom.app.ecobank\n\ncom.paypal.android.p2pmobile\n\nThe Nexus malware can acquire seed phrases from Trust and Exodus wallets and steal wallet balances\nby abusing the Accessibility service, as shown in the below code snippet.\n\nFigure 11 – Malware Extracts Balance and Seed Phrase of Crypto Wallets\nLike the SOVA v5 variant, the Nexus malware incorporates a ransomware module that encrypts files\nstored on the compromised device.\n\nThe figure below illustrates this function.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 12 – Ransomware Module in the Nexus Malware\nA PingTasks service has been registered by the malware, which is responsible for receiving commands\nfrom the C&C server and carrying out the respective operations.\n\nFigure 13 – Malware Receives Commands from the C&C Server\nBelow, we have listed the commands used by the TAs to control infected devices:\n\n**Command** **Description**\n\nget2fa Extracting 2FA code from Google Authenticator\n\nstart2faactivator Enables 2FA activator\n\nstop2faactivator Disables 2FA activator\n\ndelbot Deactivate the device admin and uninstall the malware\n\nopenurl Opens the URL received from the C&C server into the WebView\n\n\n-----\n\nstartlock Locks the screen\n\nstoplock Unlocks the screen\n\ngetperm Starts device admin activation\n\ndelapp Functionality not implemented, saving Boolean value into shared preference\n\nclearappdata Not Implemented\n\nstartextraverbose Saving value in the shared preference variable to TRUE.\n\nstopextraverbose Saving value in the shared preference variable to FALSE.\n\nstarthidenpush Hides push notifications\n\nstophidenpush Stops hiding push notifications\n\nstarthidesms Hide SMSs\n\nstophidesms Stops hiding SMSs\n\nscancookie Insert package name to the cookie-stealing list\n\nstopcookie Removes package name from the cookie-stealing list\n\nscaninject Add injections to the “injects” list\n\nstopscan Remove injections from the “injects” list\n\ngetsms Steal SMSs from an infected device\n\nclearsmslist Delete SMSs from an infected device\n\nstartkeylogs Starts keylogging\n\nstopkeylogs Stops keylogging\n\ncontactssender Send SMSs to the contacts present in an infected device\n\nsendsms Sends SMSs from an infected device\n\nopeninject Downloads and start injection for targeted application\n\ngetapps Collecting basic device information\n\nsendpush Shows push notification\n\nenableinject Receives the target app for injection\n\nrunapp Run application based on server response\n\nforwardcall Forwards the call\n\ncall Make the call\n\ndisableinject Delete injections\n\ngetcontacts Collects contact list from the infected device\n\n\n-----\n\nstartmute Mutes an infected device\n\nstopmute Unmutes an infected device\n\ngettrustwallet Steal the Trust wallet seed phrase and balance\n\ngetexodus Steals Exodus wallet seed phrase and balance\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn the past, TAs had created the fifth iteration of the S.O.V.A. Android banking trojan, which not only\ntargeted the banking sector but also included a ransomware feature. Now, TAs are advertising a\nrebranded version of the S.O.V.A. malware called “Nexus” on cybercrime forums with an updated list of\ntargeted banks. By exploiting accessibility services, the “Nexus” Android banking Trojan can now target\n40 banking applications to steal user credentials.\n\nCyble Research & Intelligence Labs continuously monitors campaigns.
