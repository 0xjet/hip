    "plain_text": "# Cybercriminals shop around for schemes targeting retail\n\n**intel471.com/blog/retail-cybercrime-threats-2021**\n\nRetail has long been a cornerstone of business on the internet, giving people a convenient\nway to track down any and every product or service they could possibly want. However, even\nas subsets of the retail industry — such as dining or hospitality — find ways to leverage the\ninternet to enhance their business, the cybercriminal underground has found ways to attack\nthat growth for their own illegal financial gain.\n\nWhile top echelon brands have a near cult-like following of customers who have come to\nknow them for their products or services, the cybercriminal underground understands the\nbigger the company, the bigger portfolio it likely has connected to the internet. Given the\nunderground’s ability to either find unprotected systems or get around the security guarding\nthem, criminals know they don’t have to attack a retail company’s flagship product for their\nefforts to be profitable.\n\nIntel 471 has observed criminals going after large retail and hospitality companies in a\nnumber of ways. Be it trying to attack user accounts, cloud-based infrastructures, or publicfacing internet assets, any part of a company’s overall portfolio will likely be targeted by a\ncriminal if they feel they can derive value from it. Below are some examples of what Intel 471\nhas observed when it comes to cybercrime focused on the retail industry.\n\n## Rewards programs are a prime target\n\n\n-----\n\nOne such scheme Intel 471 has observed is criminals breaking into retail-associated\naccounts for their “rewards” points in an attempt to exchange those points for gift cards at\nvarious retailers. In March 2019, we observed a Maldivian actor selling access to an\ninternational hotel chain’s rewards points in a Discord dedicated to breaking into various\nonline accounts. Upon purchase, the actor would take points out of various accounts and\ncash them in for Amazon gift cards.\n\nOn the low end, access to lists with rewards accounts that held between 14,000 and 75,000\npoints were priced between $10 and $50. On the high end, access to lists with rewards\naccounts that held approximately 335,000 to 880,000 rewards points were priced between\n$200 and $600.\n\nIntel 471 observed several users paying between $50 and $875 for access to points, which\nwere then converted into gift cards.\n\nThis actor has an extensive history in account checking, with reputable personas on the\nCrackingPro and Nulled forums, and provided proof of monetizing the hotel rewards\naccounts on Amazon. The information received positive comments from multiple actors on\nthe Discord channel.\n\n## Access to infrastructure\n\nIn September 2020, Intel 471 observed a Russian-speaking actor trying to sell unauthorized\naccess to cloud-based infrastructure they claimed to belong to “one of the most famous hotel\nchain brands in the world.” The actor allegedly gained unauthorized access to a Microsoft\nAzure instance operated by the company, along with a management panel catering to about\n100 domain names associated with the company’s lines of business.\n\nDue to this access, the actor was able to discern that the company paid millions of dollars for\nthe infrastructure. However, they were unable to do anything beyond edit WHOIS records for\nvarious websites; the actor could not tamper with a name server (NS) or start of authority\n(SOA) records.\n\nShortly after Intel 471 confirmed this information, the actor claimed the access no longer was\navailable. It was unclear whether the actor sold or lost it at the time of this report.\n\n## Cracking creds\n\nIn March 2021, Intel 471 observed a long-standing member of the cracked.to cybercrime\nforum offering account-cracking tools and related services, with one in particular built to\ntarget a rewards program.\n\n[The actor advertised configuration files for the free penetration-testing tool OpenBullet that](https://intel471.com/glossary#:~:text=a%20new%20one.-,Penetration%20Testing,-An%20authorized%2C%20simulated)\nwould allow an attacker to collect various information from a hotel chain’s rewards program.\nThe actor provided a brief demonstration video to a configuration file targeting the program,\n\n\n-----\n\nrevealing the script made 4,557 checks per minute (CPM) and captured credit card\ninformation, reward points balances, and email addresses.\n\nThe actor was selling this in a private Discord server alongside a similar OpenBullet\nconfiguration file that targeted a multinational credit card company.\n\n## Moving money\n\nIf cybercriminals aren’t dealing with money itself, they often reach for gift cards as their next\nbest option. Whether it be physical cards or solely online credits, the underground has long\nused gift cards as a conduit to move money.\n\nThe buying, selling and trading of gift cards is still prevalent in 2021. While cards tied to highend multinational retailers have always moved through underground forums, the actors\ninvolved are new, using the gift card trade to find a footing in the cybercrime underground.\n\nIn September 2020, Intel 471 observed one such newcomer on a Turkish-language\ncybercrime forum sharing a tactic that would allow someone to use compromised PayPal\naccounts on an United Arab Emirates (UAE)-based website where users can buy online gift\n[cards. The method involved manipulating cookies, disguising IP addresses and using various](https://intel471.com/glossary/ip)\nHTML codes to bypass security protocols used by the website. The method also worked on\ntwo Turkish retail sites that sell gift cards and other goods.\n\nThe actor requested 200 Turkish lira (about US $25) for access to this method.\n\n## Criminals value video games\n\nA more seasoned actor who has a presence on multiple well-known cybercrime forums has\nmade a name for himself in the past few months by buying and reselling gift cards and video\ngame keys. Intel 471 observed this actor holding a presence on over 10 cybercrime forums,\nadvertising that he would buy cards and keys for 65 percent to 85 percent of their value to\nresell them through other platforms.\n\nThe actor said he was looking for cards tied to well-known e-commerce and app stores, and\nkeys tied to e-commerce sites that serve both PC and console gamers, as well as stores run\nby game developers.\n\n## Big stashes for cash\n\nIn February 2021, an actor Intel 471 has been tracking for several years offered to sell\n895,000 gift cards issued by more than 3,000 companies that included well-known brands in\nclothing, online retail, transportation and technology sectors, among others. The actor aimed\nto sell the entire database for US $20,000, even as the gift cards’ value allegedly amounted\nto more than US $38 million. The actor also expressed willingness to consider offers by other\nactors to monetize the database for a share of profit.\n\n\n-----\n\nAfter testing some of the accounts, the actor amended the offer, claiming many of the gift\ncards were invalid. After the change, the actor expressed readiness to provide a sample from\nthe database to test and showed a willingness to negotiate the price with a prospective\nbuyer.\n\n## Retail's ransomware threat\n\nRansomware is a top threat for all internet-connected businesses. Retail is no different.\n\nOver the past year, Intel 471 have observed numerous retailers or third-party partners falling\nvictim to ransomware attacks. These incidents have all the hallmarks of other ransomware\nattacks: systems locked, data exfiltrated, and business operations left crippled or shut down\naltogether.\n\nIn November 2020, South Korea-based conglomerate E-Land Group was hit with CLOP\nransomware, forcing the company to shut down a portion of its corporate network, along with\n[23 of its 50 physical retail locations. The attackers told media outlets that they had been in](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-gang-says-they-stole-2-million-credit-cards-from-e-land/)\nthe system for nearly a year, gathering data on customers that they would eventually take for\nthemselves. Intel 471 discovered in December that the operators took and released Track 2\npayment card data, which other threat actors could use to produce fake credit cards.\n\n[Operators pulled off this attack by taking advantage of vulnerabilities in the Accellion file](https://intel471.com/glossary/vulnerability)\ntransfer appliance (FTA) software, which has been linked to a series of high-profile\ncompromises including the Singaporean telecom company Singtel, U.S. law firm Jones Day,\nand U.S. grocery store chain Kroger. CLOP reportedly used this flaw to also go after U.S.\nrailroad company CSX Corp. and multinational tech company Qualys.\n\n## Supply chain in the crosshairs\n\nIntel 471 has not only observed direct attacks on retailers, but also those that hit companies\ntied to their supply chain. In April 2020, operators of the NEIFILIM ransomware variant\nattacked Sri Lankan lingerie and apparel manufacturer MAS Holdings, which makes various\nclothing items for highly-known brands around the world. The operators leaked 9 GB data on\ntheir leak blog, claiming that they stole around 300 GB in total.\n\nWhile the attack was launched in April, operators were likely inside the MAS Holding’s\nsystems for weeks prior to the ransomware being launched. Intel 471 observed an actor\nselling access to the company’s network in March 2020.\n\nAnother company — U.S.-based packaging company Westrock — was attacked by\n[operators of DarkSide ransomware in January 2020. In an investor note released by the](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/westrock-provides-ransomware-incident-120000156.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAD5039vLsksNbhEglEBsFBg2YcsbQAey4Hj8lA1XsQcs1_agfIgTHpZkBroEP_K0DJZWSEZdBeYSRqWduuKYAl8ZhTARdyfODjiG31mENuqfniFhHEO_NWIZ4Bqa19IAHcVfo4BC1hI2VcdWNHKJDobiC_Qzk2GBZsOq6x7-w0Ez)\ncompany a week after the incident began, Westrock said it had shut down certain systems\n“in an abundance of caution” and shipments from some of the company’s facilities “lagged”\nbehind normal production levels. That may have partly been due to the company’s\nnegotiations with operators: Intel 471 observed a DarkSide representative tell Westrock that\n\n\n-----\n\nthe group retained access to the company s network and continued to encrypt data on the\nservers, even during negotiations. In all, the ransomware operators allegedly attacked two\nlocal domains that hosted more than 500 databases and backup servers with more than 1.2\nPB of data.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSo much of retail business depends on the internet, especially given that consumers have\ndepended on online-only options during the COVID-19 pandemic. That has forced retail\ncompanies to embrace more of a technology-driven business profile, which then leads to\nmore of their business needing to be as secure as possible. As long as this continues to be\nthe trend, cybercriminals will look for vulnerable targets, hoping to siphon money away from\nbusinesses that have not taken the right security precautions. It’s imperative that security\nteams understand what schemes are proliferating on the cybercrime underground and\ncompare it against their own security posture in order to proactively defend against their\nbusiness and customers falling prey to these various schemes.\n\n\n-----",
