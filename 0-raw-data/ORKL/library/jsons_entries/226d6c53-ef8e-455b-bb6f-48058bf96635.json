CrowdStrike Intelligence has also been tracking and reporting internally on this](https://www.crowdstrike.com/endpoint-security-products/falcon-x-threat-intelligence/)\nthreat group since mid-January 2014 under the name FLYING KITTEN, and since that time\nhas seen targeting of multiple U.S.-based defense contractors as well as political dissidents.\n\n**Flying Kitten Targeted Intrusion**\n\nFireEye’s report notes that this adversary’s targeted intrusion activity consists of credential\ntheft and malware delivery individually. The FLYING KITTEN campaigns investigated by\nCrowdStrike Intelligence showed that the actor actually combines the two. For example, the\nadversary will register a domain that spoofs the name of the targeted organization and then\nhost a spoofed login page on that site.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe page is used to steal legitimate credentials, but once users enter the credentials, they\nare often redirected to a new page that prompts them to download a “Browser Patch” or\nother similar type of file. The downloaded file is actually the Stealer malware that exfiltrates\nstolen data to an FTP server.\n\nIn addition to the aerospace/defense and dissident targeting, it also appears that FLYING\nKITTEN is also engaged in broader targeting via the website parmanpower[.]com. This\nwebsite is registered via the same registrant email (info[@]usa.gov.us) and other Whois\ninformation as some of the other domains related to the activity discussed above. It purports\nto be the website of a business engaged in recruiting, training, and development in Erbil,\nIraq.\n\n\n-----\n\nNo malicious activity has been linked to this domain, however, the fact that it was registered\nunder the same registrant email at the same time as other FLYING KITTEN domains linked\nto malicious activity, it is likely that the adversary is using this site for malicious purposes as\nwell. The website does not appear to deliver any malware, so its most likely purpose is to act\nas a credential-collection mechanism much like the spoofed Institute of Electrical and\nElectronics Engineers (IEEE) Aerospace Conference website (aeroconf2014[.]org) the\nadversary used earlier this year. This spoofed recruiting company website could be used to\ntarget entities across a wide range of sectors.\n\n**Attribution**\n\nAttribution in this case is interesting, as the adversary appears to have made a mistake when\nregistering its malicious domains. The registrant email that currently appears in the Whois\nrecords of some of the FLYING KITTEN domains is info[@]usa.gov.us, however historical\nrecords show that the domains were originally registered under the email address\nkeyvan.ajaxtm[@]gmail.com.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs FireEye’s report notes, the keyvan.ajaxtm@gmail.com email address ties back to an Iranbased entity called Ajax Security Team. Earlier this year, Ajax Security had an easily\nidentifiable presence on the Internet with its own website and related Facebook pages.\n\nThis Internet presence has decreased significantly since early 2014, likely due to a desire to\nkeep a lower profile now that the group is engaged in targeted intrusion activity.\n\nThe following Yara rules will provide detection for the adversary remote access toolkit and\nexfiltration tool:\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nrule CrowdStrike_FlyingKitten : rat\n{\nmeta:\n\n```\n```\n      copyright = \"CrowdStrike, Inc\"\n\n```\n```\n       description = \"Flying Kitten RAT\"\n\n```\n```\n       version = \"1.0\"\n\n```\n```\n       actor = \"FLYING KITTEN\"\n\n```\n```\n       in_the_wild = true\n\n```\n```\n    strings:\n\n```\n```\n       $classpath = \"Stealer.Properties.Resources.resources\"\n\n```\n```\n       $pdbstr = \"\\Stealer\\obj\\x86\\Release\\Stealer.pdb\"\n\n```\n```\n    condition:\n\n```\n```\n       all of them and\n\n```\n```\n       uint16(0) == 0x5A4D and uint32(uint32(0x3c)) == 0x4550 and\n\n```\n```\n       uint16(uint32(0x3C) + 0x16) & 0x2000 == 0 and\n\n```\n```\n       ((uint16(uint32(0x3c)+24) == 0x010b and\n\n```\n```\n      uint32(uint32(0x3c)+232) > 0) or\n\n```\n```\n       (uint16(uint32(0x3c)+24) == 0x020b and\n\n```\n```\n      uint32(uint32(0x3c)+248) > 0))\n\n```\n```\n}\n\n```\n```\nrule CrowdStrike_CSIT_14003_03 : installer\n\n```\n```\n{\n\n```\n```\n    meta:\n\n```\n```\n       copyright = \"CrowdStrike, Inc\"\n\n```\n```\n       description = \"Flying Kitten Installer\"\n\n```\n```\n       version = \"1.0\"\n\n```\n```\n       actor = \"FLYING KITTEN\"\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\n       in_the_wild = true\n\n```\n```\n    strings:\n\n```\n```\n       $exename = \"IntelRapidStart.exe\"\n\n```\n```\n       $confname = \"IntelRapidStart.exe.config\"\n\n```\n```\n       $cabhdr = { 4d 53 43 46 00 00 00 00 }\n\n```\n```\n    condition:\n\n```\n```\n       all of them\n\n```\n```\n}\n\n```\n\nYou can use this rule with CrowdStrike’s free [CrowdResponse tool to easily scan your](http://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/new-community-tool-crowdresponse/)\nsystems for presence of FLYING KITTEN.
