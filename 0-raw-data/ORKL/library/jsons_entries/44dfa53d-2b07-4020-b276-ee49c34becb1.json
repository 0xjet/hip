Every button, value,\nlogo, pipe, and piece of equipment represented in the HMI has a corresponding image file\nsomewhere in the HMI software’s directory. Not only that, configurations that contain values,\nmappings, logic, thresholds, and lexicons are stored in text files alongside the image files. In\none ransomware incident that affected an HMI, we found that 88% of the encrypted files\nwere JPEG, BMP, or GIF files — the images used by the HMI to render the interface. If all of\nthese files were encrypted, recovering the affected systems would not just end with a\nreinstallation of the ICS software. Additionally, the custom HMI or SCADA interface would\nneed to be restored as well.\n\nTake note that ransomware does not need to directly target the ICS software’s processes in\norder to incapacitate the ICS. By encrypting the files that the HMI, SCADA, or engineering\nworkstation (EWS) depends on, ransomware can render the system useless, resulting in\nboth a [Loss of View and](https://collaborate.mitre.org/attackics/index.php/Technique/T0829) [Loss of Control scenario for the operator, and ultimately,](https://collaborate.mitre.org/attackics/index.php/Technique/T0827) Loss of\nProductivity and Revenue for the factory.\n\nTheft of Operational Information\n\n\n-----\n\nNetworked file sharing is practically a necessity in manufacturing environments. On the\noperational side of things, engineers and designers use it not only as a means to share\ndesign and engineering documents that they are working on, but also as a repository for\nreference files, guidelines, parts lists, tooling, and workflow.\n\nOn the business operational side of things, managers and staff use network shares to store\ninformation about vendors, suppliers, purchase orders, invoices, and the like. A dedicated\nsupply chain management (SCM), and/or product life cycle management (PLM) system and\nits associated databases could even be found on Level 4 or 5.\n\nAlthough a ransomware attack that affects these file repositories and databases would not\nnecessarily disrupt the production line, it would hamper business operations, supply chain\nmanagement, and product engineering and design. Unfortunately, those are only the shortterm consequences. Modern ransomware operations also involve data theft, which leaves a\npermanent impact.\n\nIn a trend started by the [Maze ransomware, it is now almost standard practice for](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/maze-ransomware-attacks-us-it-firm)\nransomware groups to steal data from their victims, utilizing off-the-shelf file backup tools to\ndo the job. Initially, the purpose of this was to increase the likelihood of payment by the\nvictim, as the data leak allows for the additional threat of blackmail. However, data from\nransomware victims is also being leaked to or sold in the underground. This is particularly\nunfortunate for enterprises since design and engineering documents could contain\nintellectual property. In addition, vendor and supplier information could contain confidential\nsupply chain data such as pricing and order information.\n\nManufacturing companies should consider these possibilities in case they ever face a\nransomware incident. Once the production and business operations are restored, an\nassessment of stolen data needs to be done. Afterward, organizations should ask\nthemselves a painful question: If the data is leaked or sold, what would the repercussions be\nfor production, business relationships, and customers? The answers to this would guide an\norganization’s post-mortem actions and enable a more effective response strategy.\n\nPost-Intrusion Ransomware\n\nOver the years, there has been a dramatic decrease in incidents of ransomware arriving as\nemail attachments or being installed through malicious websites (see Figure 4). However,\njudging by news headlines, many might think that the amount of ransomware being\ndistributed at large has not decreased at all.\n\nRansomware\n\nRansomware threats have disrupted the manufacturing industry significantly in 2020. In a\ndisturbing trend during the third quarter of the year, attackers appeared to be singling out\nmanufacturing organizations as a victim of choice in their ransomware operations.\n\n\n-----\n\nBy: Ryan Flores December 01, 2020 Read time: ( words)\n\nContent added to Folio\n\n\n-----",
