MoqHao is\ngenerally used to target Android users, often via an initial attack vector of phishing SMS\nmessages (smishing).\n\n\n-----\n\nThe threat group behind Roaming Mantis are characterized as Chinese-speaking and\nfinancially motivated, first public acknowledgement goes back to around 2018. The group\nhas historically targeted countries in the Far East – Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, but they\nare expanding their campaign.\n\n\n-----\n\n[In our most recent post (MoqHao Part 2: Continued European Expansion), we demonstrated](https://www.team-cymru.com/post/moqhao-part-2-continued-european-expansion)\nhow Roaming Mantis had widened their sights to Western countries, including France,\nGermany, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\n\nFurther Reading\n\n[MoqHao Part 1.5: High-Level Trends of Recent Campaigns Targeting Japan](https://www.team-cymru.com/post/moqhao-part-1-5-high-level-trends-of-recent-campaigns-targeting-japan)\n\n[MoqHao Part 1: Identifying Phishing Infrastructure](https://www.team-cymru.com/post/moqhao-part-1-identifying-phishing-infrastructure)\n\nIn this post we will explore whether Roaming Mantis have continued to expand their\noperations over the past year, focusing on their activities in recent months. In doing so we\nwill seek to highlight some techniques which we have utilized to pivot to connected\ninfrastructure.\n\n## Key Findings\n\nIdentification of 14 MoqHao C2 servers, based on malware analysis and pivots within\ncontextual data sets.\n\nEvidence of Roaming Mantis campaigns targeting every continent, with Africa, Asia,\nand Europe the most impacted.\n\nClose to 1.5 million victim communications to the MoqHao C2 servers observed since\nthe end of 2022.\n\nThe scope of Roaming Mantis continues to grow; all mobile users should be conscious\nof smishing threats, particularly from operators who have evolved their campaigns over\nseveral years.\n\n## MoqHao Command & Control\n\nAs in previous posts, our analysis begins with the identification of infrastructure utilized for\nthe purpose of post-infection communications, once a malicious APK (MoqHao) has been\ninstalled on a victim device.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe rationale for this approach is two-fold:\n\n1. The delivery and installation methodology for MoqHao includes the use of ‘disposable’\n\nstaging infrastructure which generally utilizes Dynamic DNS services, in addition to\nlegitimate platforms, such as Baidu, Imgur, Pinterest, and VKontakte. Analysis of\nnetwork telemetry data associated with these phases of an infection is complicated by\nthe presence of security research, scanning, and (large volume) benign user activity.\nFurthermore, until beacons to a Moqhao C2 server are observed, it is not wholly\naccurate to identify any communications as ‘victim’ related.\n\n2. Whilst MoqHao’s delivery infrastructure has a short shelf life, its C2 infrastructure is\n\nused for extended periods of time and in some cases even reused after periods of\ninactivity. By analyzing stable infrastructure, we can draw higher level conclusions on\ntargeting, i.e., where large groupings of victim connections originate from. In addition,\nas this infrastructure is more static, by disclosing it we can have the greatest impact on\nRoaming Mantis operations.\n\n**Figure 1: Simplified Delivery Chain for MoqHao**\n\n\n-----\n\nOur initial method of identifying MoqHao C2 infrastructure is based on analysis of malware\nsamples. In this case we have started with three malware samples identified within our\ninternal malware holdings, which are also available in VirusTotal.\n\n_MoqHao is detected by several antivirus vendors as ‘Wroba’, querying for this string within_\n_malware repositories will generally lead to connected samples._\n\n**37134b50f0c747fb238db633e7a782d9832ae84b**\n\n_This file was first uploaded on 24 October 2022 by a user in Canada, it is configured to_\n_receive C2 information (91.204.227.31:28877) from a user profile on VKontakte._\n\nExamining network telemetry for 91.204.227.31 (HDTIDC - South Korea) we observe a\ncampaign targeting users in Australia, with the most recent victim connections occurring\naround 29 January 2023.\n\nOpen Ports information for 91.204.227.31 identifies that TCP/5985 was open during the\nperiod when victim connections occurred. The banner data obtained from scanning that port\ncontains reference to a Computer / Domain Name - WIN-VLVN3FLKKGL.\n\n**Figure 2: Open Ports Information for 91.204.227.31**\n\n\n-----\n\nPivoting on the WIN-VLVN3FLKKGL value we identified four additional IP addresses, all\nwithin 91.204.227.0/26.\n\nWe found victim communications to three of these IP addresses, two of which were identified\n[in previous reporting (by Kaspersky) as MoqHao C2 servers:](https://securelist.com/roaming-mantis-dns-changer-in-malicious-mobile-app/108464/)\n\n**91.204.227.32 << Kaspersky C2**\n\n**91.204.227.33 << Kaspersky C2**\n\n**91.204.227.51**\n\nThe first two C2s are used in campaigns primarily targeting users located in Asia, but also\nAustralia (as was the case with 91.204.227.31). A significant proportion of victims were in\nJapan, Nepal, and Thailand.\n\n**91.204.227.51 was used as the C2 server for a campaign targeting users in France, with the**\nlast victim connections observed around 26 February 2023.\n\n**198b55d4e7c7c0ee4fc4cbe13859533e651b91f6**\n\nThis file was first uploaded on 20 February 2023 by a user in Canada, it is configured to\nreceive C2 information (198.144.149.142:28866) from a user profile on VKontakte.\n\nExamining network telemetry for 198.144.149.142 (NETMINDERS - Canada) we observe a\ncampaign targeting users globally - in Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, and Oceania,\nwith victim connections still occuring at the time of writing.\n\n\n-----\n\nOpen Ports information for 198.144.149.142 identifies an RDP certificate hosted on\nTCP/3389 with a Common Name value of sid380.\n\n**Figure 3: Certificate Data for 198.144.149.142**\n\nPivoting on the sid380 value we identified 12 additional IP addresses, all within\n198.144.149.128/28.\n\nWe found victim communications to one of these IP addresses, which was identified in the\nKaspersky reporting as a MoqHao C2 server:\n\n\n-----\n\n**198.144.149.131 << Kaspersky C2**\n\nAs in the case of 198.144.149.142, this C2 is used in campaigns targeting users globally,\nfurther including South America (Brazil and Suriname).\n\n**5ceb8950759a8d9d31389d1370d381d158c79fbe**\n\nThis file was first uploaded on 25 February 2023 by a user in Japan, it is configured to\nreceive C2 information (91.204.227.43:29872) from a user profile on VKontakte.\n\nExamining network telemetry for 91.204.227.43 (HDTIDC - South Korea) we observe a\ncampaign targeting users in India, with the most recent victim connections occurring around\n03 March 2023.\n\nOpen Ports information for 91.204.227.43 identifies that TCP/5985 was open during the\nperiod when victim connections occurred. The banner data obtained from scanning that port\ncontains reference to a Computer / Domain Name - M172-17-64-184.\n\n**Figure 4: Open Ports Information for 91.204.227.43**\n\n\n-----\n\nPivoting on the M172-17-64-184 value we identified 13 additional IP addresses, all within\n91.204.227.0/26.\n\nWe found victim communications to seven of these IP addresses, one of which was identified\nin the Kaspersky reporting as a MoqHao C2 server:\n\n**91.204.227.37**\n\nCampaigns targeting users in Turkey and the United States.\n\n**91.204.227.39 << Kaspersky C2**\n\nCampaigns primarily targeting users in India and Nepal, with additional targeting in the\nMiddle East and North America.\n\n**91.204.227.41**\n\nA campaign targeting users in South Africa.\n\n**91.204.227.42**\n\nCampaigns primarily targeting users in Europe (Austria and Czech Republic), with additional\ntargeting in Asia and the Middle East.\n\n**91.204.227.47**\n\nCampaigns targeting users in Malaysia and Nepal.\n\n**91.204.227.48**\n\nA campaign targeting users in the Czech Republic, with additional targeting in Belgium, the\nDominican Republic, and Turkey.\n\n\n-----\n\n**91.204.227.49**\n\nCampaigns targeting users in India, Portugal, South Africa, and the United Kingdom, with\nsmaller clusters of victims globally (Africa, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, North America, and\nOceania).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhilst this analysis is caveated by the fact it is based on sampled data, and that some\nresearcher / scanning activity likely slipped through our net, we were able to identify\nconnections, indicative of victims, from 67 distinct countries.\n\nApproximately 80% of connections were from the East Asian region (primarily Japan), which\ncould be referred to as the ‘traditional’ operating base of Roaming Mantis. However, when\nyou remove those connections from the data, you’re left with a picture of the operators’\nefforts to expand globally.\n\n**Figure 5: Spread of Victim Communications**\n\n\n-----\n\nUsers from Africa, other regions in Asia, and Europe in particular are increasingly appearing\nin victim communications to MoqHao infrastructure.\n\nSmishing often doesn’t receive the same level of attention as phishing when it comes to the\nmalware delivery stakes. But, with over 1 million observed victim connections since the end\nof 2022 related to Roaming Mantis alone, it is clearly a viable initial access vector.\n\nIf Roaming Mantis can develop their delivery methods globally, to match the depth and ‘real\nfeel’ spoofing of their East Asian campaigns, we would anticipate that the threat to users will\ncontinue to grow over coming months and years.\n\n## Recommendations\n\nWe encourage continued education on mobile device security in general and smishing\nmore specifically, to arm users with the knowledge required to identify and avoid\nthreats.\n\nWhere feasible, connections to the static MoqHao C2 servers listed in the IOC section\nbelow should be pre-emptively blocked.\n\nUsers of Pure Signal Recon can track MoqHao campaigns based on the methods\ndescribed in this blog post.\n\n## IOCs\n\n**MoqHao Samples**\n\n198b55d4e7c7c0ee4fc4cbe13859533e651b91f6\n\n37134b50f0c747fb238db633e7a782d9832ae84b\n\n5ceb8950759a8d9d31389d1370d381d158c79fbe\n\n\n-----\n\n**MoqHao C2 Servers (With Port Pairings 🍷)**\n\nACTIVE (14 March 2023)\n\n**HDTIDC LIMITED - South Korea:**\n\n91.204.227.32:28877\n\n91.204.227.33:28899\n\n91.204.227.37:28836\n\n91.204.227.37:28856\n\n91.204.227.39:28844\n\n91.204.227.41:29869\n\n91.204.227.42:29871\n\n91.204.227.47:28999\n\n91.204.227.48:28843\n\n91.204.227.49:29870\n\n**NETMINDERS - Canada:**\n\n198.144.149.131:28866\n\n198.144.149.142:28866\n\nINACTIVE (Date)\n\n\n-----\n\n**HDTIDC LIMITED - South Korea:**\n\n91.204.227.31:28877 (29 January 2023)\n\n91.204.227.43:29872 (03 March 2023)\n\n91.204.227.51:36599 (26 February 2023)\n\n**NETMINDERS - Canada:**\n\n198.144.149.131:28867 (05 January 2023)\n\n198.144.149.131:28868 (22 February 2023)\n\n198.144.149.131:28869 (03 January 2023)\n\n\n-----",
