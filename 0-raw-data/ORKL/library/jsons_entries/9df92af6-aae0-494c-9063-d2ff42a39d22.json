They named the campaign Operation Cloud Hopper.](https://www.pwc.co.uk/issues/cyber-security-data-privacy/insights/operation-cloud-hopper.html)\n\nCloud Hopper turned out to be an attack of unprecedented scale that targeted companies\nknown as “managed IT service providers”, or MSPs. Because MSPs manage the IT systems\nof hundreds of clients, the technique used by the Cloud Hopper attackers was highly\neffective – they gained access not only to the sensitive data of the MSPs themselves, but\nalso to their clients globally.\n\nBy attacking a handful of companies, the Cloud Hopper actors gained access to potentially\nthousands of networks.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Cloud Hopper analysis by PwC and BAE Systems\n**APT10 was behind Cloud Hopper**\n\nPwC and BAE assessed that Operation Cloud Hopper was almost certainly managed by the\nthreat actor known within the Information Security community as “APT10”. This assessment\nwas based on the group’s highly interconnected network of infrastructure, which had\nconnections with APT10’s previous operations. The Palo Alto Networks report menuPass\n[Returns with New Malware and New Attacks Against Japanese Academics and](https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2017/02/unit42-menupass-returns-new-malware-new-attacks-japanese-academics-organizations/)\nOrganizations shows that a series of old APT10 command and control (C2) domains\n(including cmdnetview[.]com) associated with servers that were later used by the Cloud\nHopper group.\n\nThe [Cloud Hopper report released by PwC and BAE assessed that APT10 had significantly](https://www.pwc.co.uk/cyber-security/pdf/cloud-hopper-report-final-v4.pdf)\nincreased its scale and capability since early 2016 and was focused on espionage activity by\ntargeting intellectual property and other sensitive data.\n\nIt was also assessed at the time that APT10 was highly likely to be a China-based threat\nactor, based on a series of clues including the compile times of binaries, registration times of\ndomains, activity indicating a pattern of work in line with China Standard Time and a mix of\ndiplomatic and political targets being closely aligned with China’s strategic interests.\n\n\n-----\n\nCloud Hopper analysis showing activity during working day in UTC+8 timezone\n**So what?**\n\nAnalysts working with this blog have spent the last year investigating the most damaging\nattacks to hit Western companies, starting with APT10.\n\nWe have identified a number of individuals behind the attack and the companies with which\nthey have been associated.\n\nWe plan to tell the story – check back for more over the next month…\n\n\n-----",
