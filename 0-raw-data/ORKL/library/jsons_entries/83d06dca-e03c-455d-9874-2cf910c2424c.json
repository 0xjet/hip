Overview\n\n**In the unsettling landscape of Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine, cyber remains one of**\n**the most enduring mysteries.**\n\nEven before Russian troops invaded Ukraine in February, many experts in the West, in\nUkraine, and in Russia believed Moscow would use cyberattacks to inflict major damage on\nUkraine prior to or after the start of the military offensive. Indeed, Russia has extensive and\nformidable cyber capabilities. Reality, however, has played out differently.\n\nExactly why cyber has not been a consequential front in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is\nunknown. It may be that Ukrainian cyberspace proved to be much better protected than\nsome thought. Or it may be that Russia did not use its offensive cyber capabilities because\nthe Kremlin interfered in every aspect of the preparation of the war, from military planning to\ncyber activities. The Kremlin wanted the invasion to play out as a “special operation\" (in the\nKremlin’s words), not a conventional military offensive. In this, as in much else, the Kremlin\ngreatly miscalculated.\n\nWhile an answer to the mystery of Russian cyber successes and failures in and around\nUkraine is beyond the scope of this report, the case is nonetheless instructive, underlining\nthe importance of understanding how Russian cyber operations are governed. The political\nelement has always been decisive in the Russian cyber playbook, much more so than in\nother parts of the Russian security state. It, thus, comes as no surprise that over the years\nthe command-and-control structure managing Russian cyber operations has developed into\nsomething very different.\n\nThe list of Russian cyber actors is long and complicated. It includes private entities, both\nlegitimate and criminal, alongside traditional security services, the military, and the top\npolitical level where decisions are made. The relationship among these actors has changed\nquite significantly in the past six years. This report is an attempt to map the Russian cyber\nlandscape and to help understand the intricate web of cyber actors.\n\nKey Russian cyber actors include:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe FSB: The Federal Security Service (Federalnaya Sluzhba Bezopasnosti; FSB) is a\nmajor domestic security and intelligence agency. In cyber, the FSB’s capabilities are\ndivided between those the agency has been building since the late 1990s (the 18th\nCenter, or Information Security Center) and the capabilities the FSB acquired in 2003\nwhen it absorbed several departments of the Russian electronic intelligence (ELINT)\nagency, the Federal Agency for Government Communications and Information, or\nFAPSI (the 16 Center of the FSB or the Center of Electronic Intelligence inth\nCommunications).\nThe SVR: The Foreign Intelligence Service (Sluzhba Vneshney Razvedki; SVR) is\nRussia’s spy agency, a direct successor to the foreign intelligence branch of the KGB.\nThe agency never went through any structural reforms, but its capabilities were\nsignificantly expanded in the 2010s, including in cyber.\nThe military: The cyber capabilities in Russia’s military are run by two directorates\nwithin Russia’s General Staff: the GU (or the Main Intelligence Directorate and the 8th\nThese two directorates run operations and supervise Russian cyber troops and the\nmilitary research and development effort. Cyber command was never launched despite\nseveral attempts in the early 2010s.\nThe Presidential Administration: The direct successor to the Central Committee of the\nCommunist Party, the Presidential Administration supervises Russia’s intelligence and\nsecurity services. An integral part of the administration is Russia’s Security Council,\nwhich provides strategic thinking in all areas of national security, including cyber; it is\nalso a government body tasked with maintaining contact with its Western counterparts,\nincluding a cyber “red line” between Moscow and Washington.\nPrivate cybersecurity companies: These companies are tied into Russia’s cyber effort\nvia networks of official and unofficial contacts. Their role is to provide expertise and\nhelp with recruitment efforts.\n\nDespite this broad range of actors involved in cyber operations on various fronts, Russia\ndoesn’t have a unified cyber command. Rather, coordination with the political decisionmakers is done at the Presidential Administration level, with Russia’s Security Council an\nintegral part of the process. Moreover, unlike in the conventional field of operations, there is\nno strict division of labor between the agencies in the cyber domain. Agencies traditionally\nfocused on foreign targets have attacked domestic targets (including nongovernmental\norganizations, journalists, and the Russian opposition). Outside Russia, the military has\ntargeted political and private industry and the SVR and FSB have attacked military targets,\nand vice versa.\n\nWhile reliable data are limited, this report delves deeply into the history and evolution of\nRussia’s cyber actors, revealing a remarkably fluid and informal landscape, which is often\ndifficult to interpret and navigate even for those who operate within it. What emerges is a\nsystem of cyber operations that is:\n\n\n-----\n\nCoordinated through a set of political processes centered on the Presidential\nAdministration and the Security Council, rather than a traditional, military-style\ncommand structure;\nCharacterized by significant overlap in mission and capability, often leading to\ncompetition for resources and sometimes to problems of coordination and conflict;\nSubject to a significant degree of informality and political maneuvering, as different\nactors report to the Presidential Administration and Security Council via different\nchannels and with differing degrees of accountability; and\nHeavily dependent on the private sector for training, recruitment, and technology,\nleading to a high degree of informal interagency integration at the grassroots level.\n\nThe United States and Russia have clashed for years over what terminology to use:\n“information security,” promoted by Russian officials, versus cyber, used by the United\nStates. The Russian approach is more expansive and includes both psychological and\ntechnical elements, but essentially what the Kremlin means is control over online content —\ni.e., censorship.\n\nPhoto: Moscow, Russia. 2 November 2018.

History & Development\n\n\n-----\n\n## 2.1. Origins\n\nToday’s cyber command-and-control systems originated in the Soviet Union’s signals\nintelligence (SIGINT) bureaucracy.\n\nThroughout the Soviet period, two intelligence agencies were involved in breaking codes.\nThe KGB had the 16 Directorate, in charge of intercepting and deciphering foreignth\ncommunications. The General Staff of Armed Forces had the 8 Directorate and the Specialth\nService of the GRU. Two agencies together ran Soviet SIGINT (which did not intercept text\nor speech but focused on identifying radio signals) and ELINT (which intercepted text and\nspeech, i.e., content) centers abroad, including a facility at Lourdes in Cuba, which\nmonitored and intercepted radio communications in the United States.1\n\n\nSoviet military codebreakers were trained at the Krasnodar Higher Military School named\nafter General of the Army S. M. Shtemenko — the school was supervised by the 8th\nDirectorate of the General Staff. 2 The personnel for the 16 Directorate of the KGB wereth\ntaught at the KGB Higher School, the Fourth (Technical Department) in Moscow. The Fourth\nDepartment of the KGB Higher School had a better reputation and attracted students from\nthree Soviet agencies that sent their recruits to study cryptography: the KGB, the Ministry of\nDefense, and the Ministry of Radioelectronic Production.\n\nThe KGB and GRU actively recruited talent in civilian universities known for their excellent\nmath programs — the Moscow State University’s departments of Physics and Math and\nMechanics and Math (the latter had helped to form the Fourth Department of the KGB Higher\nSchool), Moscow Engineering Physics Institute (MEPhI), and Moscow Institute of Physics\nand Technology (MFTI or PhysTech).\n\nThis system largely survived the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\n\n-----\n\n2.2. The 1990s: The FAPSI Monopoly and Connection to the Cyber Industry\n\n\n-----\n\nThe KGB was restructured when the Soviet Union dissolved in late 1991. The 16\nDirectorate, along with several departments in charge of providing secure communications\nfor party bosses, became the Committee of Government Communication. In December\n1991, it was renamed as the FAPSI. 3 The idea was to create a Russian analogue of the US\nNational Security Agency (NSA), but the FAPSI was also entrusted with conducting public\nopinion polls — for the Kremlin’s eyes only — and, later on, with providing digital security for\nRussian elections.\n\nThe system of training and recruitment remained the same — the Fourth Department of the\nKGB Higher School, which was renamed as the Institute of Cryptography,\nTelecommunications and Computer Science (IKSI) within the FAPSI, and the FAPSI kept\nrecruiting at MEPhI, MFTI, and Moscow State University. In 1996, the FAPSI sponsored the\nestablishment of the Educational and Methodological Association of Higher Educational\nInstitutions on Information Security (UMO IB) under the auspices of the IKSI.\n\nThe FAPSI was structured into six main directorates. The most important was the 3rd\nDirectorate — the Main Directorate of Electronic Intelligence in Communications (Glavnoye\nUpravlenie Radioelectronnoi Razvedki Na Setyah Svyazi; GURRSS), in charge of spying on\nforeign telecommunications. The 3 Directorate was the former 16 Directorate of the KGB.rd th\n\n\nBetween 1995 and 1998, the 3 Directorate was led by Vladislav Sherstyuk, a KGB officerrd\nsince 1966 and a graduate of the Physics Department at Moscow State University. Sherstyuk\nwould play a major role in Russia’s approach to cyber issues for decades.\n\nSherstyuk saw military action in the First Chechen War — he was put in charge of the\nFAPSI’s task group deployed to Chechnya, and he organized the interception of the\nChechens’ communications.\n\n\nIn 1998, Sherstyuk was named head of the FAPSI. 4 The same year the FSB — the major\ndomestic counterintelligence and counterterrorism agency — under the leadership of a new\ndirector, Vladimir Putin, entered the cyber field. In the Central Apparatus of the FSB, a new\nunit called the Directorate of Computer and Information Security (UKIB – Upravlenie\nKompyuternoy I Informatsionnoy Bezopasnosti) was formed. It was subordinate to a larger\ndepartment of counterintelligence. The UKIB was housed in a blockish, looming structure\nthat was once the KGB’s Computation Center, on the corner of Lubyanka Square and\nMyasnitskaya Street in Moscow. The FAPSI was headquartered in a stark, modern terraced\nbuilding with giant antenna globes on the roof not far from Lubyanka Square, on Bolshoy\nKiselny Lane.\n\nIn the Armed Forces, the General Staff’s 8 Directorate was still operational, but it lackedth\nresources. Both the FSB and the military’s cyber capabilities were largely overshadowed by\nthe FAPSI.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe early 1990s also saw the emergence of private cyber companies, like Kaspersky Lab,\nwhere the management had worked for the KGB. Kaspersky Lab CEO Evgeny Kaspersky\nhimself had graduated from the Fourth Department of the KGB Higher School.5 Thanks to\ntheir KGB background, those companies cultivated close relations with the security services\nand law enforcement agencies. What helped the FAPSI cultivate those relationships was that\nover the years the agency had been creating an industrial empire engaged in information\nsecurity. The FAPSI was also in charge of licensing information security software — firewalls,\ncryptography, and so on — which meant that private companies needed to cooperate with it\nto get licenses.6\n\nThe period from 1998 to 1999 was probably the most influential time for the FAPSI.\n\n\nIn May 1999, Sherstyuk was transferred to the Security Council as its first deputy head. In\nDecember, he was appointed to preside over the information security section.7 That section\nbecame the main unit where the cyber and information security concepts were implemented.\nOne of the brains behind it was Anatoly Streltsov, a former KGB colonel.\n\nBoth Sherstyuk and Streltsov understood that they needed a research facility on cyber\npolitical issues that would help them engage in political decision-making on cyber. Thus, a\ndepartment was created within Moscow State University under Sherstyuk and Streltsov’s\nsupervision which soon became the Institute for Information Security Issues. This institute\nemerged as a major think tank that defines Russian foreign policy on information security.\n\nIn 2000, Sherstyuk and Streltsov’s team composed the “Doctrine of the Information Security\nof the Russian Federation,” which included a broad list of threats, ranging from\n“compromising of keys and cryptographic protection of information” to “devaluation of\nspiritual values,” “reduction of spiritual, moral and creative potential of the Russian\npopulation,” as well as “manipulation of information (disinformation, concealment, or\nmisrepresentation).”8\n\nThroughout the 1990s, the FAPSI and officials affiliated with it controlled the Russian cyber\ndomain by training, conducting operations, co-opting the private cyber industry, and\nestablishing government cyber policies.\n\n\n-----\n\n2.3. The 2000s: The FSB Takes Over\n\n_2.3.1. Structural changes_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe early 2000s saw a massive and rapid expansion of the FSB, including into the cyber\narena.\n\nOn March 11, 2003, President Putin split the FAPSI between the FSB, the SVR, and the\nFederal Protective Service (FSO), in charge of providing protection for him and other highlevel officials. 9\n\n\nGovernment communications and polling of public opinion were considered such a sensitive\ndomain they were given to the FSO to supervise — and within that agency, the Service of\nSpecial Communication and Information (Sluzhba Specialnoy Svazyi I Informatsii; SSSI).\nThe 3 Directorate was moved to the FSB and became the 16 Center of the FSB (therd th\nCenter of Electronic Intelligence in Communications). The regional ELINT units of the FAPSI\nwere reorganized into the FSB Information Reception Centers.\n\nIn 2004, the FSB underwent administrative reform just like the rest of the federal agencies.\nDepartments were renamed as services, and the UKIB was turned into the Information\nSecurity Center (TsIB or Centr Informatsionnoy Bezopasnosti) or the 18 Center of the FSB.th\nThe new center remained within the Service of Counterintelligence.\n\nThe FSB was divided into two large parts. The operations departments carried out\ncounterintelligence, intelligence, counterterrorism, and other activities, whereas the support\nside of the organization included such activities as creating and providing special technical\nequipment and meeting other material needs. The TsIB was situated in the operations\ndepartment, which was the most proactive. It was involved not only in the technical\nprotection of computer networks but also in active operational surveillance, clandestine\nactivity, and intelligence collection on the Internet. Inside the TsIB, the Operative Directorate\nwas created to conduct operations.\n\n\nThe SVR founded a scientific production center, Delta, to conduct research and development\n(R&D) on cyber issues. 10 Delta was subordinate to the Directorate of Informatization of the\nSVR.\n\n_2.3.2. Cyber policymaking_\n\nSherstyuk continued to define cyber policy while at the Security Council, the central body at\nthe Presidential Administration responsible for managing the formulation and execution of\nsecurity-related policies, though his position changed. In 2004, he was demoted to the\nposition of assistant to the head of the Security Council. He was forced to rely on the FSB’s\nsupport since the most important departments of his former agency had been incorporated\ninto the FSB. He also ensured the continued existence of the Institute for Information\nSecurity Issues at Moscow State University.\n\n\n-----\n\nAt the Foreign Ministry, Sherstyuk s team was supported by Andrei Krutskikh, an arms\ncontrol talks veteran who shared Sherstyuk’s approach to cyber issues detailed in the\n“Doctrine of the Information Security of the Russian Federation.” 11\n\nThe General Staff was sidelined by the FSB, which, for the most part of the 2000s,\nsuccessfully rebuffed all attempts by the military to expand into the area of cyber.\n\n_2.3.4. Modus operandi under development_\n\nThe 2000s were the period when the first cyberattacks took place beyond Russia’s borders,\nincluding an attack on Estonia in 2007. Proxy groups affiliated with the Presidential\nAdministration took responsibility for these attacks. APT29 or Cozy Bear — a Russian\nhacker group believed by Western cyber experts to be affiliated with either the FSB or SVR\n— was operational since at least 2008, according to Western experts.\n\n_2.3.5. Recruitment and training_\n\nThe former FAPSI directorates, now within the FSB, continued recruiting from MEPhI, MFTI,\nand the Physics and Math Department at Moscow State University.\n\nIn training, the IKSI, previously within the FAPSI, was placed under the control of the FSB\nand became part of the FSB Academy.\n\nThe national program of training of civilian rank and file was significantly expanded: 73\nRussian universities and high schools came to teach information security, united in the UMO\nIB. The chief institution supervising the association was the IKSI, which defined the UMO IB’s\nrequirements and guidelines. Of the 73 universities and high schools, only five institutions\nwere military; the rest were higher polytechnic schools and state universities across the\ncountry.\n\nTraining in cyber followed the Soviet model of prioritizing loyalty and technical prowess over\nethical considerations, resulting in an effective and devoted cyber workforce. After being\nrecruited, students rarely, if ever, questioned why they were tasked with attacking Western or\ndomestic targets, including Russian journalists and opposition politicians. Once again, the\nSoviet legacy is to blame. The Soviet Union had the biggest engineering community in the\nworld because of its huge military-industrial complex — a collection of industries and\nresearch facilities which worked exclusively for the Soviet army and the KGB. To serve it,\nJosef Stalin founded dozens of technical schools all over the country. For many decades,\nSoviet engineers were schooled intensively in technical subjects but rarely had exposure to\nthe humanities. The scope of their education was exceedingly narrow. Unlike medical\ndoctors who were trained in ethics, engineers were not. They were taught to be technical\nservants of the state. They were also taught secrecy since most of them were meant to work\nfor the military-industrial complex of the KGB. As a result, generations of engineers were\ntrained and worked their entire lives with little understanding of politics or trust of politicians\n\n\n-----\n\nand were suspicious of public activity as a whole. That system was never reformed after the\ncollapse of the Soviet Union. After Putin became president, the Soviet approach to technical\neducation based on secrecy and patriotism was only reaffirmed.\n\nIn addition, Russia’s security services adopted a new tactic: approaching Russian criminal\nhackers and recruiting them. The FSB found itself in a good spot because the TsIB was\ntasked to prosecute criminal hackers. Thus, they were able to give the hackers a choice:\neither join the FSB or go to prison. Of course, some accepted and even joined the TsIB.12\nThe 2008 Russia-Georgia war only helped to solidify this new approach, but there are\nreports that some Russian hackers had been recruited even before the war.13\n\n\nIn 2009, the Education Ministry introduced a new educational standard that institutionalized\n\"information security\" as an area of study in Russian universities — cyber became a national\npriority in Russia’s higher education.14\n\n\n-----\n\n2.4. The 2010s: Explosive Growth\n\n_2.4.1. Structural changes_\n\n\n-----\n\nIn 2012, Sergei Shoigu was appointed minister of defense. Ambitious and energetic, Shoigu\nwanted to prove himself as a military expansionist — cyber was a promising domain for\nincreasing military influence. He also wanted his own cyber troops. He correctly identified the\npotential source of cyber personnel: the country’s extensive network of technical universities.\n\nIn July 2013, Shoigu attended a meeting with Russian rectors at the Moscow State Technical\nUniversity (MGTU) (one of the 73 educational institutions that provided training in information\nsecurity) and told them of “a start of a major hunt for young programmers.”15 Later that\nsame year, Russia’s cyber troops were launched and advertised on YouTube, with the\nKalashnikov rifle compared to a laptop.16\n\n\nThe Russian army still largely relied on the draft, and Shoigu tightened the rules for\nconscripts. It became impossible to avoid military service after graduating from college.\nWhen the cyber troops were launched, students in polytechnic universities were presented\nwith a choice: either go to some distant army unit in Siberia or join the cyber troops, where\nstudents were used to staff the so-called research companies (military units). The first\n“research company” was launched at the Military Airforce Academy in Voronezh – one of the\nfive military schools on the list of 73 universities that were providing training in information\nsecurity.\n\nBy 2014, the list of Russian universities teaching information security had expanded to\n170.17\n\n\nThe Russian army skillfully exploited an old, outdated mechanism of draft to recruit the best\nand brightest among the Russian technical intelligentsia, sidelining the FSB. In the military,\ntraining in information security is supervised by the 8 Directorate of the General Staff inth\ncoordination with the Military Education Department of the Main Personnel Directorate of the\nGeneral Staff.\n\nThe military also used other recruitment methods developed by the FSB — in 2015, the\nCapture the Flag (CTF) competitions run by the Association of Chief Information Security\nOfficers (ARSIB, or Assotsiatsiya Rukovoditeley Sluzhb Informatsionnoy Bezopasnosti) got a\nnew sponsor, the Special Development Center of the Ministry of Defense.18 That center was\nlaunched by the Ministry of Defense in 2014 as a leading military cyber facility.19 That same\nyear, in December 2014, the 8 Directorate of the General Staff founded a research centerth\non information security within the Krasnodar Higher Military School named after General of\nthe Army S. M. Shtemenko.20 One of the “research companies” was based at the center and\nsupervised by the 8 Directorate and the Science-Technical Committee of the General Staffth\n— the main customers of R&D in the military.21\n\n\n_2.4.2. Cyber policymaking_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe old guard led by Sherstyuk and Krutskikh still controlled Russia s cyber policy domain,\nbut new actors came into play. First, the FSB delegated the head of the Science-Technical\nService (NTS), Nikolai Klimashin, to the Security Council. He replaced Sherstyuk who\nremained active through his position at the Institute for Information Security Issues at\nMoscow State University. Klimashin did not have a background at the FAPSI, but he was\nchosen to supervise the liquidation and absorption of the FAPSI in 2003 (Putin wanted to\nhave just one major intelligence/security agency — the FSB — not a competition of several\nagencies which his predecessor, Boris Yeltsin, had encouraged). As a result, Klimashin’s\nNTS now included a department of the absorbed FAPSI, the Main Directorate of Security of\nCommunications (GUPS), which became the 8 Center of the FSB or “the Center forth\nInformation Protection and Special Communications.”\n\nThe General Staff of the Armed Forces became engaged in the cyber policy debate. One of\nthe leading military cyber experts was Sergey Komov, himself a product of military SIGINT\ntraining (Komov attended Kyiv’s military radio-technical school and Govorov’s military radiotechnical academy in Kharkiv).\n\nSince the early 2000s, Infoforum, a major Russian cyber conference, has been held in\nMoscow and later in the other regions. The General Staff has made sure to attend every\nInfoforum conference since 2013. As a rule, the head or deputy head of the 8 Directorate ofth\nthe General Staff has been in attendance, sometimes accompanied by the head of the\nMilitary Science Committee of the General Staff.\n\n\nThe year 2016 saw the highest point of attention to cyber from the Kremlin. In February\n2016, the Infoforum conference opened with a speech by Sergei Ivanov, then the chief of the\nPresidential Administration. “The powerful potential of such authoritative discussion platforms\nas Infoforum is fully engaged in solving the issues of ensuring information security,” Ivanov\nsaid. Ivanov was a former general of the foreign intelligence branch of the KGB, a close\nassociate of Putin’s, and served as minister of defense from 2001 to 2007. He was also\nreportedly one of the masterminds of the Russian interference in the US elections in 2016.22\n\nOn August 12, 2016, Ivanov was removed from his position as chief of Putin’s administration\n(most likely because of the US outcry over the hacking of Democratic National Committee\nservers), but Putin preserved his seat on the Security Council.\n\nEver since, no Infoforum conference has been opened by the chief of Putin’s Presidential\nAdministration. It is quite likely that Putin no longer wants a direct connection between the\nKremlin and a public cyber event.\n\n_2.4.3. Development of recruitment techniques_\n\nIn 2010, a collection of private cybersecurity companies launched the ARSIB. The ARSIB\nwas led by Victor Minin, a former officer of the KGB and FAPSI. The ARSIB runs the CTF\ncompetition at schools and universities in Russia. CTF is a massive, multiday hackathon in\n\n\n-----\n\nwhich one team defends its server as another team attacks it. Minin told the authors of this\nreport that the CTF competitions were seen by Russia’s intelligence community as a perfect\nrecruitment mechanism.\n\nREGISTER NOW\n\nThe 14th Annual CEPA Forum — “Meeting the Moment: Allies at a Crossroads” — will\ntake place virtually from September 27-29, 2022. Over the course of the Forum, CEPA will\nhost a dynamic series of virtual keynotes, discussions, debates, and stories focusing on the\ntransatlantic response to Russia’s war in Ukraine and its implications for security and\ndemocracy.\n\n[REGISTER NOW](https://cepa.org/events/cepa-forum/)\n\n## 3. Russia’s Evolving Cyber Command\n\n3.1. Russia’s Cyber Landscape after 2013\n\nThroughout the turbulent period between 2013 and 2016, marked by Russia’s invasion of\nUkraine and illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and reckless interference in the US\nelections two years later, Russian cyber actors went through a series of crises brought on by\nthe Kremlin.\n\nBy and large, the traditional actors, foremost the FSB, maintained a dominant role since they\nwere well entrenched in the Russian security bureaucracy, including in positions on the\nSecurity Council, the Presidential Administration, and the Foreign Ministry.\n\n\n-----\n\nInside the FSB, the TSiB and the 16 Center remained the two most important cyberth\nplayers.\n\nIn information sharing and recruitment/training:\n\nThe TsIB was focused on using the connections between the vast Russian criminal\nhacking community and Russian private cybersecurity companies, including Kaspersky\nLab. The FSB also made the TsIB a contact point with Western counterparts to share\nintelligence about Russian criminal hacker activity worldwide. The TsIB made\namusingly good use of the shared intelligence. It tracked down Russian hackers and\nsought to recruit them.24\nThe 16 Center relied on its significant cyber capabilities and recruited new talent inth\nRussian polytechnic schools with courses in information security, supervised by the\nFSB’s IKSI.\n\n\nThe head of the 16 Center, Sergey Buravlyov, held the position of deputy director of theth\nFSB since 2005, and in 2013 he was promoted to the Security Council as deputy secretary,\nreplacing Klimashin. Buravlyov was part of Sherstyuk’s circle. Another one of Sherstyuk’s\n\n\n-----\n\nprotégés, Krutskikh, who had been serving at the Foreign Ministry, got a new position. In\nFebruary 2014, Putin appointed Krutskikh as his special representative for international\nnegotiations on Internet regulation.25\n\nAfter the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014, there was a significant and sudden increase in\nRussia’s military cyber capabilities.\n\nThe Russian army found a way to boost its capabilities both in human resources and\nexpertise. Rank and file were provided via the skillful use of the draft — students in Russian\npolytechnic schools joined Russian cyber troops in droves. The army also expanded training\nin cyber at military schools that taught personnel for SIGINT units (in Russian terminology,\nradio technical intelligence, or OSNAS), like the Higher Military School of Radioelectronics in\nKrasnoyarsk.\n\nContracts were also granted to private cyber companies. In 2015, Kaspersky Lab’s software\nwas chosen by the Ministry of Defense as its primary antivirus solution. “By supplying the\nKaspersky Business Space Security to the Russian Ministry of Defense through partners, we\nmarked the beginning of a very important cooperation for us,” said Sergey Zemkov,\nmanaging director of the Russian office of Kaspersky Lab at the time.26\n\nThe interference in the 2016 US elections (APT29 and APT28) and the resulting backlash\nfrom the US intelligence community created a crisis in Moscow where officials blamed one\nanother for getting caught. The TsIB was decimated as a result of purges. Two senior TsIB\nofficers were arrested on charges of treason. The head of the investigations unit at\nKaspersky Lab and the head of the TsIB were forced to resign. The head of the TsIB’s deputy\nalso lost his job.\n\nIn January 2017, Buravlyov was quietly removed from the Security Council. Contrary to all\nKremlin rules, no public announcement was made about his resignation. Buravlyov was\nreplaced by Oleg Khramov, a brutal FSB general with no background in cyber but with\nexperience conducting offensive operations in Ukraine. Apparently, both the TsIB and\nBuravlyov, who maintained officially sanctioned contacts with Western counterparts, fell\nvictim to the Kremlin’s paranoia.\n\n\nAs a contact point with Western powers, the TsIB was replaced by the 8 Center of the FSB.th\nA national computer emergency response team (CERT), called the National Coordination\nCenter on Computer Incidents, was built in the 8 Center. The 8 Center also originatedth th\nfrom the FAPSI, but it was part of the NTS of the FSB; thus, it was not on the operational but\nrather the support side of the FSB.\n\nOf the two cyber actors within the FSB, the 16 Center (dubbed Berzerk Bear, Dragonfly,th\nand Energetic Bear by Western cyber researchers) emerged as a primary cyber offensive\nunit. In 2021, US authorities accused three officers of the 16 Center of sending fake e-mailsth\nwith infected attachments to energy, including nuclear, companies in the United States\n\n\n-----\n\nbetween 2012 and 2017. According to the indictment, the three officers used spearphishing\nattacks that targeted more than 3,300 users at more than 500 US and international\ncompanies. They also targeted US government agencies such as the Nuclear Regulatory\nCommission.27\n\n\n-----\n\n3.2. Military’s Cyber Activities\n\n_3.2.1. Further expansion of the military_\n\n\n-----\n\nIn recent years, the Ministry of Defense has built grand new facilities, like the buildings of the\nKrasnodar Higher Military School named after General of the Army S. M. Shtemenko and the\nElite of the Russian Army (ERA) Technopolis in the Krasnodar region, operational since\n2018.\n\nThe ERA Technopolis houses eight “research companies,” including the “first research\ncompany” launched within the Military Airforce Academy in Voronezh — one of the five\nmilitary schools on the original list of 73 educational institutions providing training in\ninformation security. The Advanced Research Projects Foundation (FPI), established in 2012\nas a Russian analogue of the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA),\nwas also partly relocated to the ERA.28\n\nThe Ministry of Defense also found a new use for the military research facilities not\npreviously associated with cyber.\n\nThe Central Scientific Research Institute of Chemistry and Mechanics (TsNIIKhM) has been\nthe major research institution in the Russian military-industrial complex since before the\nRussian Revolution of 1917, involved in development and production of gunpowder,\n\n\n-----\n\nammunition, and explosives for the army (in the Soviet Union it was known as NII-6). In\n2005, the TsNIIKhM was subordinated to the Federal Technical and Export Controls Service\nin charge of protecting state secrets from foreign intelligence services via technological\nmeans. “This decision was the reason for a radical restructuring of this work, including the\norganization of new areas of scientific research,” TsNIIKhM’s website declared.29\n\nOn October 23, 2020, the US Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control\n(OFAC) designated the TsNIIKhM, pursuant to Section 224(a)(1)(A) of the Countering\nAmerica’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA), for knowingly engaging in\nsignificant activities undermining cybersecurity against any person, including a democratic\ninstitution, or government on behalf of the Russian government.30 The TsNIIKhM was found\nresponsible for building a customized tool that enabled the August 2017 cyberattack on a\nMiddle Eastern petrochemical facility.31 The TsNIIKhM developed the Triton malware, also\nknown as TRISIS and HatMan, to target and manipulate Industrial Controls Systems (ICS)\nthat are used in some critical infrastructure facilities. The TsNIIKhM deployed the malware\nthrough phishing that targeted the petrochemical facility.\n\n\nOn the operations side, the 85th Main Special Service Center (Glavny Tsentr Specialnoy\nSluzhbi; GTsSS), or military unit 26165 (dubbed Fancy Bear, APT28, or Strontium by\nWestern cyber researchers) emerged as the main offensive facility of the Main [Intelligence]\nDirectorate of the General Staff, along with military unit 74455.32 In the Soviet Union, that\ncenter was part of the GRU’s radio technical intelligence, or SIGINT; it was updated in the\n2000s.\n\nThe GTsSS has been recruiting new talent in Russian schools since at least 2014 via\ncooperation with the FSB’s IKSI.33 It also recruits at hackers’ conventions (see below). At\nleast one officer of that center, Aleksey Morenets (wanted by the FBI since 2018), graduated\nfrom the Military Airforce Academy in Voronezh.34 There is also 18 TSNII (Central Research\nFacility), or military unit 11135, operational since 1938, which has been involved in\nSIGINT/ELINT research, including “developing the equipment for conducting and coding\nsatellite reconnaissance activities,” and is now involved in information security under the\nauspices of the Main [Intelligence] Directorate.\n\n\nThe supervision of the cyber units in the military stayed the same — the 8 Directorate, theth\nMain [Intelligence] Directorate, and the Science-Technical Committee, all at the General Staff\nof the Armed Forces.\n\n_3.2.2. Military setbacks_\n\n\nAs early as March 2012, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin spoke of the need\nto create a Russian military cyber command.35 In February 2013, Shoigu announced his\nintention to create a cyber command and ordered the General Staff to provide him with\n\n\n-----\n\nrecommendations. The defense minister set an end-of-2014 deadline. However, the cyber\ncommand was never set up.\n\nIn 2017, Aleksander Sherin, deputy chair of the Duma’s Committee on Defense, denied the\nexistence of a cyber command and cyber troops in Russia.37\n\nOne of the reasons for this setback could be that the political decision-making in cyber is still\ndominated by the FSB (at the Security Council).\n\nPhoto: Director of Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) Alexander Bortnikov and Director\nof Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) Mikhail Fradkov arrive for a wreath-laying ceremony\nmarking the 75th anniversary of the Nazi German invasion, by the Kremlin walls in Moscow,\nRussia, June 22, 2016. Credit: REUTERS/Grigory Dukor\n\n3.3. The Relationship between Russian Private and Security/Military Cyber Actors\n\nBoth the security services and the military have relied significantly on private actors to\ndevelop offensive cyber tools and conduct cyber operations.\n\nRussian state/private partnership in cyber works in several ways.\n\n_3.3.1. Partial privatization of the networks of R&D facilities inherited from the KGB_\n\n\n-----\n\nRussian security agencies and the military rely on an empire of research institutions they had\nbuilt in Soviet times. In the Soviet Union, a significant effort was made to hide and disguise\nthe true affiliation of these research institutions. Take, for example, the Scientific Research\nInstitute of Dalny Svyazi, or of long-distance communications, in St. Petersburg, known as\nDalsvyaz. The institute, with a staff of more than 10,000, was overseen by the Ministry for\nIndustrial Telecommunications, but its real purpose was to work for the military. The offices of\nthe applied acoustics unit (working on voice and speaker recognition) of Dalsvyaz were\nalways guarded by men with automatic weapons because the unit was not under the control\nof the institute at all but was instead run by the KGB. It was a classic Russian matryoshka —\nsecrets within secrets.38\n\nMany of those research centers survived the collapse of the Soviet Union, like the Kvant\nScientific Research Institute, founded in 1978 as a laboratory within the Design Bureau of\nIndustrial Automation of the Ministry of Radio Industry. The ministry was officially civilian, but\nthe Design Bureau of Industrial Automation was part of the Soviet military-industrial complex,\nwhile the Kvant laboratory was under the KGB. Kvant developed computers for the 16th\nDirectorate of the KGB. It remained under control of the FAPSI in the 1990s and went to the\nFSB in the 2000s. At present, Kvant develops cyber weapons for the 16 Center of the FSB,th\nessentially the same organization the institute has been working for since the beginning. The\nDesign Bureau of Industrial Automation also remains active — now it’s part of the Rostech\nempire and involved in developing drones. 39\n\n\nWhat has changed is that Kvant has launched private entities to work on FSB contracts. One\nof them is SyTech, a small company which has worked on contracts for the 16 Center sinceth\n2009, including a project for collecting data about users of social media (such as Facebook,\nMySpace, and LinkedIn), a project for deanonymizing Tor traffic with the help of rogue Tor\nservers, and a project to covertly penetrate P2P networks, like the one used for torrents.40\nOn the surface, SyTech is a private company, but it shares personnel and contracts with\nKvant (under US sanctions since June 11, 2018).41\n\nThis same approach is being used by the SVR. The agency has worked with private entities\nlike AO Pasit, affiliated with the SVR, on SVR contracts using its scientific production center\n“Delta” as a customer.42\n\n\n-----\n\n_3.3.2. The role of private cybersecurity companies in recruitment and developing tools_\n\nThe Russian company Positive Technologies identifies vulnerabilities in networks and\npublishes highly regarded research.43 In April 2021, the company was blacklisted by the US\nTreasury for supporting the FSB.44 According to the US Treasury, “Positive Technologies\nprovides computer network security solutions to Russian businesses, foreign governments,\nand international companies and hosts large-scale conventions that are used as recruiting\nevents for the FSB and GRU.” The company said these were “groundless accusations,”\nwhile its chief operating officer, Maxim Pustovoy, said the blacklisting was based on “a\nmisunderstanding and a mistake.”45 Positive Technologies has organized hacker\ncompetitions — Positive Hack Days and The Standoff — since 2011.46 These events have\nbeen organized very much like the ARSIB’s CTF competitions, used by the FSB to approach\nand recruit young talent (Kaspersky Lab also sponsored Positive Hack Days).47 An officer of\nthe 85 Main Special Service Center (military unit 26165) of the Russian military intelligenceth\n— Dmitriy Badin (wanted by the FBI since 2018) — took part in Positive Hack Days in\n2014.48 The same conference was also attended by officers of the FSB.49\n\n\n-----\n\nSenior managers of Positive Technologies attended Infoforum conferences since at least\n2013 and spoke alongside Krutskikh and officers of the FSB. Since 2014, Positive\nTechnologies has sponsored Infoforums.50\n\nAnother Russian company, also blacklisted by the US Treasury, is Digital Security, a cyber\nresearch group. According to the US Treasury, “Digital Security worked on a project that\nwould increase Russia’s offensive cyber capabilities for the Russian Intelligence Services, to\ninclude the FSB.”41\n\n\nWhat Positive Technologies and Digital Security have in common is that their business is\nidentifying vulnerabilities in networks. Digital Security, however, has also held a\ncompetition/conference for white hat hackers, called ZeroNights, since 2011.51 So those\ncompanies not only develop tools for Russian security services but also provide them with\nrecruiting opportunities.\n\nDigital Security’s founder, Ilya Davidovich Medvedovsky, also co-wrote a book, Attack on the\n_Internet, with two others, including a leading professor of information security at Peter the_\nGreat St. Petersburg Polytechnic University.52\n\n_3.3.3. The challenge of linking cyberattacks to the SVR_\n\nThe SVR is an ambitious and capable intelligence-gathering agency. For several years,\nWestern cyber experts attributed cyberattacks on Western targets to the SVR (in particular,\nthe attacks carried out by APT29). However, unlike other Russian agencies, such as the FSB\nand GRU, where attribution was verified independently by Russian and Western investigative\njournalists, no details that would help link cyberattacks to a particular unit at the SVR or\nexpose the chain of command inside the agency were ever found.\n\nA real-life story: a Russian hacker’s career in the year 2020\n\nA young man in his early 20s, originally from an eastern suburb of Moscow, was a student at\nBauman Moscow State Technical University. His father, a trained engineer, was a manager in\na small private company, and his mother was an accountant. The young man was about to\nbe conscripted to the army — a problem which all young men faced in Russia.\nSince the student studied computer science and information systems at the\nuniversity — much like many other students — he was given a choice: either serve a year in\na military unit located far from Moscow and live in the barracks; or join the cyber troops, stay\nin Moscow, share a room with another student, and visit family every weekend. A small\nsalary for his service was also included. The young man did not hesitate. He decided to join\nthe cyber troops, as did many of his peers, and stayed in Moscow. When he had finished\nhis time in the army, the FSB offered him a job. He agreed, which surprised even his parents.\nHis father asked him: Do you realize you won’t be able to travel abroad? I don’t really care,\nhe responded.\n\n\n-----\n\n## 4. Conclusions and Recommendations\n\nAs the world has seen in Ukraine, the Soviet military-industrial complex is back with a\nvengeance — only now, it is supplemented with cyber capabilities.\n\nWhat we know about operational command and control in Russian cyber is limited, but as\nthe history and analysis above has shown, we can draw four important conclusions.\n\n_First, Russia does not have a true cyber command. While the Presidential Administration and_\nthe Security Council coordinate cyber operations involving various agencies and non-state or\nquasi-state actors, they are not a cyber command in the US sense. There is no clear\ndelineation of operational responsibility and no uniform system of reporting and\naccountability. Rather, Russia’s cyber-active agencies and actors are governed through a\nlargely informal system of relationships in which political expediency may trump operational\nefficiency.\n\n_Second, the organizational, strategic, and cultural differences that characterize Russia’s_\nvarious military and security agencies in the conventional field do not carry over into cyber\noperations. While their leadership may prefer not to, agencies such as the SVR and the GRU\noften find themselves attacking domestic cyber targets, while the FSB is active\ninternationally.\n\n_Third, the lack of a true cyber command appears to mean that agencies tend to apply_\nconventional approaches to cyber, rather than developing command-and-control approaches\ntailored to the cyber domain. While it is not clear that this has an adverse impact on efficacy,\nit further distinguishes patterns of cyber command in Russia from those found in the West.\nUS and Western analysts must thus be careful not to assume that Russian structures and\napproaches mirror their own.\n\n_Fourth, Russia’s cyber-active state, quasi-state, and non-state cyber actors share roots in the_\nSoviet and early post-Soviet SIGINT and cyber spheres — roots that continue to shape how\nRussian cyber functions to this day. This is reflected in the significant and continuing\ndependence of state actors on the private sector for recruitment, training, and technology,\nand in the fact that all actors recruit broadly from the same cohorts of specialists, with\noperatives sometimes moving fluidly from one agency to another. In that sense, structural\ndistinctions between Russian cyber actors may be misleading.\n\n\n-----\n\nPhoto: A poster showing six wanted Russian military intelligence officers is displayed as U.S.\nAttorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania Scott Brady, accompanied by Assistant\nAttorney General for the National Security Division John Demers, speaks at a news\nconference at the Department of Justice, in Washington, U.S., October 19, 2020. Credit:\nAndrew Harnik/Pool via REUTERS\n\nIn the cyber arena, Russia’s biggest asset remains its cadres. The Soviet Union boasted the\nbiggest engineer community in the world to serve its enormous military-industrial complex.\nUnder Stalin, dozens of polytechnic schools were built across the country to train engineers,\nand networks of research facilities — secret and within the ostensibly civilian institutions —\nwere funded for those engineers to contribute to the Soviet military and security services’\nR&D.\n\nWhen the Soviet Union collapsed, this sprawling system shook but didn’t break down. Some\nparts remained in the now independent countries, some fell into complete disarray due to\nlack of funding, but by and large, the parts within Russia survived the shock of the Soviet\ndisintegration. The system did, however, experience a large hemorrhage of talent — many\nengineers went outside the tightly controlled world of the military-industrial complex to start a\nnew life in private industry. Those engineers who chose the bright side launched Russian\ntech companies, including cybersecurity companies. The engineers, and their children, who\nchose the dark side, contributed to the emergence of the phenomenon of Russian hackers.\n\nUnder Putin, Russia’s intelligence community and the military were given political and\nfinancial resources to make use of that legacy. The polytechnic schools were given\nresources to reproduce talent, and new recruitment practices were adopted to make good\nuse of those human resources which had gone private — both in the legal cyber business\nand in criminal hacker activities.\n\nThese days, Putin’s Kremlin relies on substantial cyber resources and a Soviet engineer\nculture that makes sure that enough talent and resources are available for Russia’s cyber\noperations on a global scale. The IT talent exodus from Russia is still underway, and the\norganizational competition for this talent between the services will likely only intensify, but\nthere is not yet any indication that this has diminished or will diminish the threat posed by\nRussia’s cyber capabilities.\n\n\n-----\n\nAt least two things must be done to help contain the cyber threat from Russia.\n\nOver the years, Western intelligence agencies accumulated substantial information about\nRussia’s cyber efforts. More of this data should be made available to the public, including\ninformation about the command-and-control systems, especially of the SVR. Greater\ntransparency is needed, and intelligence sharing on key actors and their activities must be\nmade a priority. Also, more transparency would help formulate more rigorous export controls\nto ensure Western tech is not enabling R&D of Russian cyber offensive operations.\n\nThe issue of Russian engineer training should also be addressed. In the foreseeable future,\none cannot hope that Russian authorities will start a proper reform of the Russian education\nsystem. But Russian IT engineers and programmers are an essential part of the global effort\nin technology development; this is one of the achievements of globalization. It would be\nuseful to set up STS (Science, Technology, and Society) courses, similar to the ones at the\nbest US engineering schools, for Russian engineers working at Western companies.\nEducating Russian IT engineers on ethics would help bring a concept of the rule of law in the\nconstantly changing world of cyber where the Russians are destined to play a key role no\nmatter what political regime is in place in Moscow.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThis report – Russian Cyberwarfare: Unpacking the Kremlin’s Capabilities – is part of CEPA’s\nongoing work on Russia’s cyber operations and below-threshold threats.
