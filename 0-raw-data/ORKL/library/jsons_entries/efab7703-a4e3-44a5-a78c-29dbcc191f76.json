Renters then have to distribute these apps to victims, each using its own methods\nand means\n\n\n-----\n\nExobot has been one of the most active Android mobile trojans in the past two years,\ntogether with BankBot, GM Bot, Mazar Bot, or Red Alert.\n\nInitially, some security firms called it Marcher, but eventually everybody started calling it by\nthe name its author had given it. Business was good as initial profits spurred Exobot's\nauthor to create Exobot v2 by late 2016.\n\n[Bleeping Computer covered Exobot v2's rise when the trojan was heavily advertised on the](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-exo-android-trojan-sold-on-hacking-forums-dark-web/)\nDark Web, hacking forums, XMPP spam, and even on the public Internet.\n\nBased on the evidence this reporter gathered in past conversations with numerous security\nresearchers, Exobot looked like a lucrative business for its author and was used to target\nusers in many countries around the world.\n\n## Exobot author puts banking trojan up for sale\n\nBut out of the blue, the Exobot author —going by the generic pseudonym of \"android\"—\nmade a major move, which in hindsight might cause a lot of problems for users in the\nupcoming future.\n\nThe Exobot author decided to shut down the Exobot rental scheme and sell the source\ncode to a small number of clients.\n\nBelow are two images of the Exobot's author sale ad, courtesy of Cengiz Han Sahin, a\nmobile security researcher at SfyLabs.\n\n\"According to his statement, he became very rich,\" Sahin says. \"Such a statement in the\nmalware world generally means one of the following two things: Either the actor notices the\nsurge of interest from law enforcement and/or competitors fighting back their market share,\neither his business has indeed been very fruitful and its ratio of risk/gain is no longer of\ninterest.\"\n\n## Many fear Exobot source code will become public\n\nBut despite the reasons, the sale of Exobot will have deep repercussions on the Android\nmalware scene, even if not right away.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis reporter has covered many such incidents in the past. Based on this reporter s\n[experience, and Sahin's own predictions, which he penned in a blog here, it's only a matter](https://clientsidedetection.com/exobot_android_malware_spreading_via_google_play_store.html)\nof time until this source code gets leaked online for everybody to enjoy.\n\nSuch sales almost never remain secret, and at one point or another, a dissatisfied customer\nwill leak the source code when Exobot's author won't provide the support the buyer needs.\nThis is how many families of desktop-based banking trojans have been leaked in the past\ndecade.\n\n[Once it gets leaked, the Exobot code will follow the same fate of Slempo, BankBot, and the](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/android-banking-trojan-source-code-leaked-online-leads-to-new-variation-right-away/)\n[GM Bot Android banking trojans, and will be tweaked and remastered into hundreds of](http://news.softpedia.com/news/android-banking-trojan-source-code-leaks-online-get-ready-for-trouble-500683.shtml)\noffshoot trojans, reducing the costs and technical skills needed to enter the mobile malware\nscene.\n\n## Exobot sale leads to new malware campaigns\n\nBut before low-skilled actors get their hands on leaked versions of Exobot, the trojan's new\ncustomers are already putting it to good use.\n\n\"Less than a month after the actor started selling the Exobot source code, new campaigns\nin Austria, England, Netherlands, and Turkey where discovered,\" Sahin says. Of all, Turkey\nis the most affected by these campaigns, with over 4,400 devices in total, based on Sahin's\ninvestigation.\n\nThis rise in malicious Exobot apps was caused by a few private sales of the Exobot source\ncode. We don't need to imagine the scale of Exobot attacks if the source code leaks, mainly\nbecause we already have an example in BankBot.\n\n[Leaked online in late 2016, this trojan has been at the heart of a recent wave of malicious](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/android-banking-trojan-source-code-leaked-online-leads-to-new-variation-right-away/)\napps spread via the Google Play Store, in what appears to be a losing battle for Google\nengineers, who are [having a harder and harder time detecting the initial apps that spread](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/google-play-store-security-scans-tricked-by-sigh-in-dev-malware/)\nthese threats.\n\nThe fragmented Android OS market, the annoying mobile carriers that never deliver\npatches in time, and the Google Play Store team that can't seem to keep up with malware\nauthors puts Android users at a serious disadvantage when it comes to mobile malware.\nThe only methods that can safeguard most users are mobile antivirus solutions and the use\nof common sense not to install apps from untrusted sources or not to install Play Store apps\nthat require unnecessary permissions.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\n[Top 10 Android banking trojans target apps with 1 billion downloads](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/top-10-android-banking-trojans-target-apps-with-1-billion-downloads/)\n\n[Mobile trojan detections rise as malware distribution level declines](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/mobile-trojan-detections-rise-as-malware-distribution-level-declines/)\n\n\n-----\n\n[New ERMAC 2.0 Android malware steals accounts, wallets from 467 apps](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-ermac-20-android-malware-steals-accounts-wallets-from-467-apps/)\n\n[SMSFactory Android malware sneakily subscribes to premium services](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/smsfactory-android-malware-sneakily-subscribes-to-premium-services/)\n\n[FluBot Android malware operation shutdown by law enforcement](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/flubot-android-malware-operation-shutdown-by-law-enforcement/)\n\n[Android](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/android/)\n[Android Exo Bot](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/android-exo-bot/)\n[Banking Trojan](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/banking-trojan/)\n[Exobot](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/exobot/)\n[Malware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/malware/)\n[Source Code](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/source-code/)\n\n[Catalin Cimpanu](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/catalin-cimpanu/)\n\nCatalin Cimpanu is the Security News Editor for Bleeping Computer, where he covers topics\nsuch as malware, breaches, vulnerabilities, exploits, hacking news, the Dark Web, and a\nfew more.
