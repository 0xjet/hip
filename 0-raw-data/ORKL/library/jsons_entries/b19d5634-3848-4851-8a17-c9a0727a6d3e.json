After a hunting](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2021/07/sidecopy.html)\nsession in our malware sample repositories and VirusTotal while looking into these actors,\nwe gathered a small collection of VBA code samples that eventually allowed us to connect\ncertain IOCs to individual threat actors based on the final payload, victimology and\nsubmission locations. For example, if the final payload was a CrimsonRAT or ObliqueRAT\nsample, we would attribute the VBA code to the Transparent Tribe group.\n\nWe then created specific rules to hunt for earlier Transparent Tribe related malicious\ndocuments and found several samples attributed to the group. Interestingly, we also found a\nsmaller subset of samples that could not be immediately attributed to the Transparent Tribe.\nWe decided to dig a bit deeper into the anomaly and conducted additional analysis of the\nVBA code and payload, which could not be easily attributed to any known group.\n\n\n-----\n\nInitial assertions on the origins of the samples we were researching.\n\nWhen these samples were first discovered, security researchers attributed them to either the\nSidewinder or Donot groups. Now, considering that Transparent Tribe focuses on targets in\nIndia and Sidewinder and Donut have been reported to focus their activities on targets in\nPakistan, it was particularly interesting to find out that VBA code of potentially opposing\ngroups reuse portions of the code.\n\n**Historical Transparent Tribe VBA code**\n\n[Transparent Tribe (APT36) is a group operating in South Asia for more than five years. The](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2021/05/transparent-tribe-infra-and-targeting.html)\nlures they use in their malicious documents indicate that their targets are Indian government\nand military organizations. The main payload employed by Transparent Tribe in most of\nassociated campaigns are variants of Crimson and Oblique RATs, which indicates that the\nobjective of their activity is obtaining foothold and persistent remote access.\n\nTheir initial infection vector is usually email, purporting to come from official sources and\ncontaining a lure, which can be a Word document or more often, an Excel spreadsheet. For\nthe purposes of this post, we're focusing on Excel VBA code and its evolution over time.\nHere, we see an early example of the VBA code employed by Transparent Tribe in May\n2019.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe code establishes a hardcoded destination path for one or more payload files and then\nuses a Text field of a user-defined form to get the content of the payload to be dropped to\ndisk. The payload is stored as an ASCII-encoded string of hexadecimal byte values\nseparated by a specific separator. The string needs to be converted into a binary byte array\nbefore it is written to disk as a ZIP compressed file. The conversion is executed in a for-each\nloop iterating over the content of the string and converting every two characters into a binary\nbyte with the help of the CByte conversion function.\n\nMay 2019 Transparent Tribe VBA code.\n\nThere are at least three fairly unique elements of the code we can use to hunt for additional\nsimilar samples: the unique destination folder path, the user-defined form containing the\n\n\n-----\n\npayload in an executable or a ZIP format and the for-each loop iterating over the content of\nthe form's text field. We used those elements to retroactively hunt for similar samples and\nfound samples that were attributed to other groups.\n\nLater Transparent Tribe example from April 2021.\n\n**Historical Donot team VBA code**\n\nThe Donot threat actor (aka APT-C-35) has operated in South Asia for more than five year.\nAlthough some of their TTPs are similar to Transparent Tribe, they focus their operations on\nPakistani government and military organizationThey also use emai, but are known to be\n[focused on installing malicious Android apps. Several samples containing the remote code](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2020/10/donot-firestarter.html)\n[exploit for CVE-2017–11882 have also been attributed to the group. Here, we are looking at](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name%3DCVE-2017-11882)\nVBA code of the malicious spreadsheets used to install custom made remote access trojans,\nkeylogging and exfiltration tools.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe found a few examples of Donot VBA code, specifically from 2018 and September 2021.\nThe similarities in the code are immediately visible, as are similarities to the Transparent\nTribe code. Our records indicate that the Donot VBA code predates Transparent Tribe code,\nalthough the confidence for that is low.\n\nEarly 2018 Donot VBA code example.\n\nOne interesting aspect of the Donot VBA code is that it often contains a fake error message\nwhich is displayed to the user before or after the payload is dropped and executed. The fake\nmessage is shown below as part of a September 2021 Powerpoint sample discovered in\nDecember 2021.\n\n\n-----\n\nFake Powerpoint message displayed by the Donot VBA code.\n\nSeptember 2021 Donot VBA code sample.\nHangover VBA code\n\nOperation Hangover may be another alias for the Donot group but it is sometimes referred to\nas a [separate group on its own. Since sometimes the operations of Donot and Operation](https://apt.etda.or.th/cgi-bin/showcard.cgi?g%3DOperation%2520HangOver%252C%2520Monsoon%252C%2520Viceroy%2520Tiger%26n%3D1)\nHangover are tracked as separate attacks, we cannot be certain they are the same group,\nthough based on code similarities we can assume they're closely related.\n\n\n-----\n\nEarly July 2019 Operation Hungover example.\n\n**Sduser code**\n\nIn June 2021, while hunting for Transparent Tribe samples, we discovered malicious Excel\nspreadsheet \"Exports promotion highlits may 2021.xls\" that attempted to dropped a\npreviously unknown RAT. This was followed in July by the discovery of the closely related\nspreadsheet \"List of Nomination of the Candidates1.xltm\". We have decided to call these\nsamples internally \"SDuser\" sample, based on the specific PDB string left in the binary\npayload.\n\nAt the time, we quickly realized there are similarities between the VBA code of these\nsamples and Transparent Tribe VBA code. However, we can see that the similarity between\nSDuser VBA code and Donot VBA code is also strong, with all the well known elements:\n\nSetting of the path to the folder for the payload.\nUsing VBA forms to store the payload with a specific separator character.\nUsing Cbyte to convert the hexadecimal strings into a binary byte array.\nDisplaying a fake Excel error message\n\n\n-----\n\nSDUser (Donot?) VBA dropper June 2021.\n\n\n-----\n\nSDUser (Donot?) VBA dropper July 2021.\n\nNot only was this interesting because it was similar code, but it was shared between APT\ngroups that had completely opposing targets. While Transparent Tribe is focusing on\norganizations in India, Donut is focusing on organizations in Pakistan and China.\n\n**Sduser binary payloads**\n\nAlthough the majority of this post is dedicated to similarities in the VBA code of the opposing\nAPT groups, we feel it is important to document binary payloads discovered in the same\nperiod as they can shed some light on the objectives of actors behind SDuser campaigns.\n\nThe samples are found on Virustotal based on the PDB path\n\"C:\\Users\\SDUSER\\source\\repos\", which was left by the developers in the payload. Overall,\nthere were almost 30 samples uploaded to VirusTotal, belonging to seven different projects:\n\nMal – January 2021\nTest – January 2021\n12324 – January 2021\nEvading____ - February 2021\nConsoleApplication4 – March 2021\nObfuscating shellcode – March 2021\nWindowsSecurity – June 2021\n\nThe functionality of the payloads was quite similar. From the upload of the first sample in\nJanuary, there were three main areas where the group has experimented:\n\nCommand and control protocol\nAnti-sandboxing techniques\n\n\n-----\n\nReverse shell mechanism\n\nThe majority of samples uploaded to VirusTotal were a part of the WindowsSecurity project\nand contained parts of the functionality developed by the earlier project.\n\nAnti-sandboxing checks in the Main function of the WindowsSecurity project.\n\nThe Windows security payload starts with the following anti-sandboxing checks:\n\nThere are two or more processor cores in the system.\nThere is more than 2GB of RAM installed on the system.\nThe mouse cursor has moved sufficiently far between checking of two positions.\nThere are more than 50 processes running on the infected system.\n\n\n-----\n\nConsoleApplication4, anti sandboxing checks in the most recent payload.\n\nIn the most recent payload, ConsoleApplication4 project, the attackers added antisandboxing checks to check for the sufficient capacity of the hard drive of the infected\nsystem as well as the presence of Virtual Box artefacts.\n\nThe payload also checks the registry for the history of USB devices added to the system. If\nno USB devices are detected, the payload will simply exit without connecting to the C2\nserver. A similar check runs for the recently opened files. The malware will continue with\nexecution unless there are at least two recently opened files.\n\nThe objective of most of the fully functioning payloads is to launch a reverse shell to connect\nto an attacker controlled C2 server. The attackers are experimenting with Metasploit\npayloads but in the payloads dropped by the Sduser malicious documents a simple\nredirection of cmd.exe standard input and output to a socket connected to an attacker\ncontrolled host is used.\n\nSome payloads also employ Telegram API and may use it to communicate with the\nattackers.\n\n\n-----\n\nSetting C2 channels and launching reverse shell in the Main function of WindowsSecurity.\n\n**Finding similarity with computer algorithms**\n\nAlthough it is very easy for a human to spot similar patterns in the code this process is not so\nsimple and obvious for computer programs. A lot of work has been done to improve the code\nand text similarity in the fields of malicious code analysis and plagiarism detection to find the\nclosest similarities.\n\nFor the purpose of this research, we chose a few algorithms that were relatively easy to\n[implement in Python, focusing on the Normalized Compression Distance,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalized_compression_distance) [Jaccard index, the](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index)\n[Winnowing algorithm for fingerprinting documents and the Python standard difflib](https://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/publications/papers/sigmod03.pdf)\ncomparison library.\n\nFor demonstration, we choose a small subset of all samples and compare them using\nvarious similarity/distance metrics.\n\nNormalized Compression Distance\n\n\n-----\n\nNormalized compression distance (NCD) is derived from the information distance, a concept\nthat is related to [Kolmogorov complexity. The absolute information distance between two](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity)\nbinary strings can be expressed as the length of a minimal program which can be created to\nconvert one string into another.\n\nFor the purpose of comparison of two strings, the distance should be normalized to show\nvalues from 0 to 1, with smaller values indicating stronger similarity between the strings we\nare comparing.\n\nUnfortunately, calculating information distance as well as normalized information distance is\nproven to be not computable due to the non-computability of the halting problem. Luckily, it\nhas been found that the normalized compression distance can be a good approximation of\nnormalized information distance.\n\nNCD can be expressed as a ratio of lengths of strings compressed with a compression\nfunction. The compression function can be any well known compression algorithm such as\n[deflate or](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflate) [bzip2 although in practice, for shorter strings, better results are obtained by using](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bzip2)\n[lzma.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lempel%25E2%2580%2593Ziv%25E2%2580%2593Markov_chain_algorithm)\n\nNCD works well for any binary string and it can also successfully be applied to unpacked PE\nexecutables. However, in our testing, for all comparison methods, we decided to first extract\n[the VBA code from the generated olevba JSON output.](https://github.com/decalage2/oletools/blob/master/oletools/olevba.py)\n\nAs the compression algorithm we used lzma and expressed NCD as the python code as a\nnormalized ratio of lengths of compressed concatenated strings and lengths of standalone\ncompressed strings.\n\nNCD expressed in python code\nJaccard distance\n\nJaccard index is a metric which is often used in clustering algorithms and is a measure of the\nnumber of common elements in 2 sets. It is defined as the ratio of the intersection of two sets\ndivided by the union of the two sets.\n\nIt's a measure of similarity for the two sets of data, with a range from 0% to 100%. The\nhigher the percentage, the more similar the two populations. Although it's easy to interpret, it\nis extremely sensitive to small sample sizes and may give erroneous results, especially with\nvery small samples or data sets with missing observations.\n\nThe Jaccard distance is simply a complement of the Jaccard index. In our research we\nsimply split the code into words and use words as the elements of the sets we are\ncomparing. Nltk, Python's framework for natural language processing contains a function that\ncalculates the Jaccard distance.\n\n\n-----\n\nWinnowing fingerprinting\n\nWinnowing algorithm is often used to detect code similarity and plagiarism in students works\nat universities, but it can also be used for general code similarity.\n\nThe advantage of the algorithm is that it can scale by reducing the number of comparisons of\nn-gram fingerprints by a significant number compared to naive comparison of hashes\ngenerated for each n-gram in the document.\n\nIn our case, we can limit the size of the window for fingerprint generation to create a larger\nnumber of fingerprints for comparison as the number of files in our test is small. In addition to\nthat, a lexer is used to tokenize the code so that the simple substitution of variable and\nfunction names is easily detected.\n\nFor our test we have used the Python copydetect module which can be used to visualize the\nsimilarity matrix from the Winnowing comparison and highlight detected similarities in the\ncode, which cannot be done with NCD and Jaccard similarity algorithms we used.\n\n[Copydetect uses the Pygments syntax-highlighting module for lexing, which is convenient, as](https://pygments.org/)\nit supports over 300 languages. Specifically, we used lexers for vb.net and vbscript and\nobtained similar results.\n\nSimilarities between the sduser1 and tt2 sample as detected by copydetect\n\n\n-----\n\nPython difflib\n\nDifflib does not perform and scale as well as Winnowing, but it is still acceptable for the\npurpose of comparing a small number of code snippets. The module is based on a string\ncomparison algorithm published in the late 1980's by Ratcliff and Obershelp and it also has\nthe ability to display similarities detected between the two compared documents.\nSimilarity algorithm comparison\n\nWe have run all algorithms over the small subset of 7 VBA code samples (from the IOC\nsection) and compared their results to estimate their success in detecting similarities in the\ncode of the opposing APT groups.\n\nComparison of similarity algorithms on a small sample subset\n\nThe findings show that algorithm results are comparable and that they indicate code reuse\nbetween the following samples:\n\nSignificant overlap between sduser1 with tt1 and tt2 code.\nSignificant overlap between sduser1 and sduser2 code.\nSignificant overlap between donot2 and hang1 code.\nSmaller overlap between hang1 and sduser1 code.\n\nIn tests, multiple algorithms can be used to improve the reliability of the results.\n\n**Summary**\n\nSimilarities of the VBA code between different groups in South Asia have been previously\n[mentioned by Tencent but here we discussed them in detail. The code reuse, which is easily](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/pJ-rnzB7VMZ0feM2X0ZrHA)\nvisible to a human eye, is confirmed by objective code similarity detection methods.\n\n\n-----\n\nOne of the strengths of software engineering is the ability to share code, to build applications\non top of libraries written by others, and to learn from the success and failures of other\nsoftware engineers. The same is true for threat actors. Two different threat actors may use\ncode from the same source in their attacks, which means that their attacks would display\nsimilarities, despite being conducted by different groups.\n\nFalse flag operations are common in warfare, when one of the sides mimics TTPs of their\nopponents in order to falsely attribute their activities and improve chances of operation\nsuccess. This is also commonly seen with cyber threat actors, with known examples, such as\nthe [Olympic Destroyer campaign and it is likely to continue in the future.](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/02/who-wasnt-responsible-for-olympic.html)\n\nCode sharing between threat actors is to be expected. Open-source tools are a useful\nsource of functionality, and adopting techniques from successful attacks conducted by other\ngroups are likely to be sources of misleading evidence leading to false attribution.\n\nWe can expect sophisticated threat actors to continue to take advantage of code reuse and\nfalse flags, to integrate evidence designed to fool analysts and lead to attribution of their\nattacks to other groups. Attribution is already difficult and it is unlikely to become easier.\n\n**Coverage**\n\nWays our customers can detect and block this threat are listed below.\n\n[Cisco Secure Endpoint (formerly AMP for Endpoints) is ideally suited to prevent the](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/amp-for-endpoints/index.html)\n[execution of the malware detailed in this post.
