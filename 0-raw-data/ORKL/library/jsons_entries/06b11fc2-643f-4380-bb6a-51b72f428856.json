Among other interesting observations,\nMicrosoft’s most-recent reporting identified the following items:\n\nIncredibly high levels of Operational Security (OPSEC) displayed by the attackers to\navoid identification or ultimate discovery of the SUNBURST backdoor.\n\n\n-----\n\nNarrowly-tailored operations with not only per-victim but even per-host unique Cobalt\nStrike configurations, file naming conventions, and other artifacts of adversary\nbehaviors.\nLikely use of victim-specific Command and Control (C2) infrastructure, including\nunique domains and hosting IPs, to further obfuscate operations while limiting the\nefficacy of indicator-based analysis and alerting.\n\nThe above discoveries emphasize that an indicator-centric approach to defending against a\nSUNBURST-like attack will fail given this adversary’s ability and willingness to avoid\n[indicator reuse. Furthermore, as revealed by CrowdStrike,](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/crowdstrike-launches-free-tool-to-identify-and-help-mitigate-risks-in-azure-active-directory/) [MalwareBytes, and potentially](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/malwarebytes-news/2021/01/malwarebytes-targeted-by-nation-state-actor-implicated-in-solarwinds-breach-evidence-suggests-abuse-of-privileged-access-to-microsoft-office-365-and-azure-environments/)\n[Mimecast, we also know that the “SolarWinds actor” leverages additional initial infection](https://www.cyberscoop.com/mimecast-email-breach-solarwinds-russia/)\nvectors (most notably abuse of Office365, Azure Active Directory, and related Microsoftbased cloud services). Therefore, multiple entities aside from those using the affected\nversions of SolarWinds Orion software must be cognizant of and actively defending against\nthis actor’s operations—yet a defense based on indicator alerting and blocking will fail given\nthis actor’s OPSEC capabilities.\n\n## SUNBURST-Related Command and Control Overview\n\nBased on reporting from multiple vendors, there was already strong suspicion that\nSUNBURST and related campaign network infrastructure was likely victim-specific at least\nduring certain stages of the intrusion. As seen in the image below, for the SUNBURSTspecific infection vector, C2 behaviors move through three distinct stages: the initial DNS\ncommunication to the common first-stage C2 node (avsvmcloud[.]com); the follow-on\nreceipt and communication to a second-stage C2 node passed via a Canonical Name\n(CNAME) response to the initial DNS request; and finally a third-stage C2 corresponding to\nthe Cobalt Strike Beacon payload installed on victim machines.\n\nIn Microsoft’s reporting from 20 January 2021, we see confirmation that while first and\nsecond stage C2 activity likely feature commonality among victims, third stage Cobalt Strike\nBeacon-related activity includes not only per-victim uniqueness but potentially per-host\nuniqueness as well:\n\n\n-----\n\nIn this scenario, individual indicators (domains or IP addresses) are effectively useless after\nthe initial SUNBURST stages, and potentially completely impractical for non-SolarWinds\ninfection vectors used by this adversary. Instead of Indicator of Compromise (IOC)-based\ndefense, defenders need to migrate to identifying behavioral and infrastructure patterns to\nflag infrastructure potentially related to this incident.\n\n### Patterns, or the Lack Thereof\n\nAt the time of this writing, across multiple vendors, there are 29 domains with associated IP\naddresses linked to SUNBURST and related activity with high confidence.\n\n\n**Hosting**\n**Provider** **SSL/TLS Certific**\n\n\n**Domain**\n\n\n**Create**\n**Date** **IP**\n\n\naimsecurity[.]net 202001-23\n\navsvmcloud[.]com 201807-25\n\ndatabasegalore[.]com 201912-14\n\ndatazr[.]com 201909-03\n\ndeftsecurity[.]com 201902-11\n\n\n199.241.143.102 VegasNap\nLLC\n\nVarious Various\nAzure\n\n5.252.177.21 MivoCloud\nSRL\n\n45.150.4.10 Buzoianu\nMarian\n\n13.59.205.66 Amazon\nTechnologies\nInc.\n\n\n6a448007f05bd50\n\n\nN/A\n\n\nd400021536d712\n\n\n8387c1ca2d3a5a\n\n\n12d986a7f4a7d2f\n\n\n-----\n\n**Hosting**\n**Provider** **SSL/TLS Certific**\n\n\n**Domain**\n\n\n**Create**\n**Date** **IP**\n\n\ndigitalcollege[.]org 201903-24\n\nervsystem[.]com 201802-04\n\nfinancialmarket[.]org 200110-02\n\nfreescanonline[.]com 201408-14\n\ngallerycenter[.]org 201910-10\n\nglobalnetworkissues[.]com 202012-16\n\nhighdatabase[.]com 201903-18\n\nincomeupdate[.]com 201610-02\n\ninfinitysoftwares[.]com 201901-28\n\nkubecloud[.]com 201504-20\n\nlcomputers[.]com 200201-27\n\nmobilnweb[.]com 201909-28\n\nolapdatabase[.]com 201907-01\n\npanhardware[.]com 201905-30\n\n\n13.57.184.217 Amazon\nTechnologies\nInc.\n\n\nfdb879a2ce7e2cd\n\n\n198.12.75.112 ColoCrossing 0548eedb3d1f45f\n\n23.92.211.15 John George a9300b3607a11b\n\n\n54.193.127.66 Amazon\nTechnologies\nInc.\n\n135.181.10.254 Hetzner\nOnline GmbH\n\n18.220.219.143 Amazon\nTechnologies\nInc.\n\n139.99.115.204 OVH\nSingapore\n\n5.252.177.25 MivoCloud\nSRL\n\n107.152.35.77 ServerCheap\nINC\n\n3.87.182.149 Amazon Data\nServices\nNoVa\n\n162.223.31.184 QuickPacket\nLLC\n\n172.97.71.162 OwnedNetworks\nLLC\n\n\n8296028c0ee552\n\n\na30c95b105d0c1\n\n\nff883db5cb023ea\n\n\n35aeff24dfa2f3e9\n\n\n4909da6d3c809a\n\n\ne70b6be2940821\n\n\n1123340c94ab0fd\n\n\n7f9ec0c7f7a23e5\n\n\n2c2ce936dd512b\n\n\n192.3.31.210 ColoCrossing 05c05e19875c1d\n\n204.188.205.176 SharkTech 3418c877b4ff052\n\n\n-----\n\n**Hosting**\n**Provider** **SSL/TLS Certific**\n\n\n**Domain**\n\n\n**Create**\n**Date** **IP**\n\n\nseobundlekit[.]com 201907-14\n\nsolartrackingsystem[.]net 200912-05\n\nswipeservice[.]com 201509-03\n\ntechiefly[.]com 201909-24\n\nthedoccloud[.]com 201307-07\n\nvirtualdataserver[.]com 201905-30\n\nvirtualwebdata[.]com 201403-22\n\nwebcodez[.]com 200508-12\n\nwebsitetheme[.]com 200607-28\n\nzupertech[.]com 201608-16\n\n\n3.16.81.254 Amazon\nTechnologies\nInc.\n\n34.219.234.134 Amazon\nTechnologies\nInc.\n\n\ne7f2ec0d868d84a\n\n\n91b9991c10b1db\n\n\n162.241.124.32 Unified Layer 9aeed2008652c3\n\n\n93.119.106.69 Tennet\nTelecom SRL\n\n54.215.192.52 Amazon\nTechnologies\nInc.\n\n\nab94a07823d8bb\n\n\n849296c5f8a28c3\n\n\nVarious Various 4359513fe78c5c8\n\n\n18.217.225.111 Amazon\nTechnologies\nInc.\n\n45.141.152.18 M247 Europe\nSRL\n\n34.203.203.23 Amazon\nTechnologies\nInc.\n\n\nab93a66c401be7\n\n\n2667db3592ac39\n\n\n66576709a11544\n\n\n51.89.125.18 OVH SAS d33ec5d35d7b0c\n\n\n[Using previous DomainTools research as a guide, we can identify some “weak” patterns,](https://www.domaintools.com/resources/blog/analyzing-network-infrastructure-as-composite-objects?utm_campaign=change-in-perspective-on-the-utility-of-sunburst-related-network-indicators&utm_source=Blog)\nsuch as clustering around certain registrars, authoritative name servers, and hosting\nproviders when these items were active—note that most of the items on this list are\ncurrently sinkholed. Yet the identified patterns are somewhat weak and overlap with a\nnumber of other activities, both legitimate and malicious, making pivoting and further\ninfrastructure discovery very difficult, if not outright impossible.\n\nFrom a Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) perspective, pivoting and indicator analysis may\nseem to be a dead-end. The following items hold, to a greater or lesser extent, for all\nobserved domains in this campaign:\n\n\n-----\n\nThe use of what appear to be older domains (re-registered, potentially taken over by\nthe threat actor, or potentially part of a “stockpile” of infrastructure kept for later use).\nReliance on cloud hosting providers (such as Amazon Web Services and Microsoft\nAzure) for domain hosting.\nUse of relatively common (if also typically suspicious) registration patterns to likely\n“hide” in the noise of domain registration activity.\n\nCombined, these observations make enrichment seem, on its face, somewhat pointless.\n\nHowever, while these items may be difficult or impossible to use from either a predictive\n(identifying new infrastructure) or historical (identifying infrastructure used by the adversary,\nbut not previously associated to it in an identified incident) external CTI analysis\nperspective, there remain options for network defenders. Most significantly, the patterns\nidentified in the items observed to date, though insufficient for external discovery on its own,\nmay be more than sufficient for internal defensive response and alerting purposes.\n\n## Operationalizing Network Observables for Active Defense\n\nChanging our perspective from external analysis to internal enrichment of observables\nyields interesting and powerful detection scenarios. In the case of SUNBURST and related\nintrusions, the adversary succeeds in subverting critical trust relationships (with SolarWinds\nOrion or Microsoft cloud services) to attain initial access to victim environments. But in order\nto actually take advantage of this subversion, the adversary requires some mechanism of\ncommunicating with and controlling the deployed capability. At this stage, defenders can\ntake advantage of this critical attacker dependency to identify that something is amiss.\n\nOne simple way of approaching the subject would be to flag new, unknown domains\nreferenced in network communications for further scrutiny. This may sound potentially\nuseful at first, but given the vast diversity of domains and the likely noise generated by user\nactivity (or even programmatic actions), such an approach dooms itself rapidly to alert\nfatigue and failure.\n\nYet this just represents a barely enriched, minimal context way of observing network\ninfrastructure items referenced in an organization’s overall network communication activity.\nIf we, as defenders and responders, can add additional context and nuance to observed\nitems and utilize this for alerting purposes, powerful possibilities emerge. Combining\ninternal network understanding with automated observable or indicator enrichment enables\nrapid, contextual network defense which can quickly identify suspicious communication\npatterns.\n\nFor example, rather than simply responding to any instance of “new” network items\nobserved, organizations may limit this response to critical services, servers, or network\nenclaves (e.g., the subnet containing various infrastructure devices). Proper network\nsegmentation, asset identification and asset tagging to identify critical items, such as\n\n\n-----\n\nSolarWinds Orion servers or various items such as email servers or Domain Controllers,\ncan allow for focused response when a significant asset initiates a previously unseen\nexternal connection.\n\nFrom a network observable perspective, just identifying that something is “new” can be\nreplaced with enrichment to identify observable characteristics of interest: hosting provider,\nhosting location, registrar, authoritative name server, or SSL/TLS certificate characteristics.\nIdentifying and alerting on combinations of these through automated enrichment—such as\nthrough [DomainTools Iris Enrich or security monitoring plugins such as DomainTools](https://www.domaintools.com/resources/api-documentation/iris-enrich?utm_campaign=change-in-perspective-on-the-utility-of-sunburst-related-network-indicators&utm_source=Blog)\nintegration with Splunk—can allow for higher fidelity, higher confidence alarms related to\nobserved network communications. In the case of the SUNBURST-related items, even the\nper-victim unique items associated with follow-on CobaltStrike activity, identifying domains\nmatching certain criteria in terms of name server and registrar associated with historical\nsuspicious activity combined with the new observation can enable security teams to vector\nresources for follow-on investigation based on the greater level of detail provided.\n\nFor a truly game-changing defensive posture that fully amplifies defender advantages in\nboth owning the network and monitoring activity emerging from it, these perspectives can\nbe combined. In this scenario, high-confidence alerting on suspicious external network\nitems post-enrichment is fused with internal asset identification to narrow this\ncommunication to a high-value asset or sensitive enclave within the network. The\nsubsequent alert represents a truly critical alarm enriching on both target and adversary\ninfrastructure aspects to focus response and drive an ensuing investigation.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe theoretical alerting scenario described above, where internal and external enrichment\nare combined to yield high-confidence, high-fidelity alarms, may appear out of reach for\nmany organizations—but given advances in adversary tradecraft, it represents where we as\ndefenders must drive operations. Although initially difficult to create, given both the network\nengineering and segmentation requirements for an accurate asset or network enclave\ndetection, as well as the establishment of logging and enrichment pipelines for observed\nnetwork indicators, once in place, an organization will find itself on a much more robust and\npowerful security footing.\n\nOnce attained, even the most complex and stealthy attacks such as the trust-abusing\nintrusions linked to SolarWinds and Microsoft services can be detected. While subsequent\ninvestigation and analysis may remain hard, as highlighted in Microsoft’s January 2021\nanalysis, at the very least defenders now have an opportunity to investigate and search for\nfurther signs of malicious activity within the network. Absent the enrichment scenarios\ndescribed above, defenders yield own-network advantages and investigation initiative to\nintruders, and place themselves in a position where an adversary mistake or migration\naway from high-OPSEC activity is necessary to enable detection and response.\n\nBy combining own-network understanding and identification with automated indicator\nenrichment through services such as DomainTools, defenders can take back the initiative\nfrom intruders and detect or even cut off initial C2 beacon activity. In this manner, defenders\nnot only adapt to but can disadvantage intruders to shift the landscape of network defense\nback in the network owner’s favor.\n\n## The DomainTools Security Research Team Discusses Their Analysis:\n\n\n-----",
