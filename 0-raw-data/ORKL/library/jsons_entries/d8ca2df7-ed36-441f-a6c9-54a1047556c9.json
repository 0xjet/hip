DustySky is a campaign which](https://securelist.com/blog/research/72283/gaza-cybergang-wheres-your-ir-team/)\nothers have [attributed to the Gaza Cybergang group, a group that targets government](http://www.clearskysec.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Operation%20DustySky_TLP_WHITE.pdf)\ninterests in the region.\n\nThis report shares our researchers’ analysis of the attack and Remote Access Tool (RAT). We\nalso discovered during our research that the RAT Server used by this attacker is itself\nvulnerable to remote attack, a double-edged sword for these attackers.\n\n## Attack\n\n\n-----\n\nThe initial infection vector in this attack is not clear, but it results in installing the Downeks\ndownloader, which in turn infects the victim computer with the “Quasar” RAT.\n\nDowneks uses third party websites to determine the external IP of the victim machine,\npossibly to determine victim location with GeoIP. It also drops decoy documents in an attempt\nto camouflage the attack.\n\nQuasar is a .NET Framework-based open-source RAT. The attackers invested significant\neffort in attempting to hide the tool by changing the source code of the RAT and the RAT\nserver, and by using an obfuscator and packer.\n\n## Detection\n\nUnit 42 researchers observed the Quasar RAT being prevented from executing on a Trapsprotected client in September 2016. We observed these Quasar samples:\n\nFile Name: f-secure.exe\n\nSHA256: 99a7cb43fb2898810956b6137d803c8f97651e23f9f13e91887f188749bd5e8f\n\nNote: connects to hnoor.newphoneapp[.]com\n\nFile Name: HD_Audio.exe\n\nSHA256: 0c4aa50c95c990d5c5c55345626155b87625986881a2c066ce032af6871c426a\nNote: connects to manual.newphoneapp[.]com\n\nFile Name: HD_Audio.exe\n\nSHA256: 86bd78b4c8c94c046d927fb29ae0b944bf2a8513a378b51b3977b77e59a52806\n\nNote: crashes upon execution\n\nFile Name: sim.exe\n\nSHA256: 723108103ccb4c166ad9cdff350de6a898489f1dac7eeab23c52cd48b9256a42\n\nNote: connects to hnoor.newphoneapp[.]com\n\nFurther research found other Quasar examples, an attack earlier in the month 2016 on the\nsame target:\n\nSHA256: 1ac624aaf6bbc2e3b966182888411f92797bd30b6fcce9f8a97648e64f13506f\n\nWe found the same Quasar code in an additional attack on the same day, but upon a different\ntarget. A second Quasar sample was also observed attacking this new victim:\n\nSHA256: 99a7cb43fb2898810956b6137d803c8f97651e23f9f13e91887f188749bd5e8f\n\nWe do not have detailed visibility into the specific host attacked, and have not been able to\nreproduce the second stage of the attack in our lab. However, based upon the timeframe of\nsubsequent telemetry we observe, we understand the attack chain as follows:\n\n\n-----\n\n1. The initial dropper (which varies across attacks) is delivered to the victim via email or\n\nweb:\n\nFile Name: Joint Ministerial Council between the GCC and the EU Council.exe\"\nSHA256: 0d235478ae9cc87b7b907181ccd151b618d74955716ba2dbc40a74dc1cdfc4aa\n\n1. The initial dropper, upon execution, extracts an embedded Downeks instance:\n\nFile Name: ati.exe\nSHA256: f19bc664558177b7269f52edcec74ecdb38ed2ab9e706b68d9cbb3a53c243dec\n\n1. Downeks makes a POST request to dw.downloadtesting[.]com, resulting in the\n\ninstallation of the Quasar RAT on the victim machine.\n2. Additional Downeks downloaders connecting to the previously-observed server\n\ndw.downloadtesting[.]com were also found in this attack:\n\nSHA256: 15abd32342e87455b73f1e2ecf9ab10331600eb4eae54e1dfc25ba2f9d8c2e8a\n\nSHA256: 9a8d73cb7069832b9523c55224ae4153ea529ecc50392fef59da5b5d1db1c740\n\nFurther research identified dozens of Dowenks and Quasar samples related to these\nattackers. All included decoy documents written in Arabic (all related to Middle Eastern\npolitics) or Hebrew. Most of them use the same mutex structure, share the same fake icon\nand unique metadata details, file writes, registry operations, and fake common program\nmetadata, as seen in DustySky samples.\n\nThe Downeks downloader and Quasar C2 infrastructures are each self-contained and\nindependent of each other. However, we did find a single shared IP address demonstrably\nconnecting the Downeks downloader and Quasar C2 infrastructure s. The below chart (Figure\n1) shows Quasar infrastructure (top), Downeks (bottom), and the shared IP link.\n\n_Figure 1- Quasar and Downeks_\n\nCharting the samples and infrastructure clearly shows the separate Downeks campaigns, and\ninfrastructure links (Figure 2):\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2- Infrastructure Patterns and Connections_\n\nIn Figure 2, top-right (green) has the Quasar infrastructure (Figure 3), with a link to the\nDowneks infrastructure. Left (yellow) is DustySky infrastructure (Figure 4) and the links to this\nDowneks campaign. As well as similarities in the code, decoys and targets, we also identified\nC2 infrastructure links between DustySky and this campaign. The remainder is subcampaigns of Downeks samples, their infrastructure, their links – and a favored ISP (center)\n(Figure 5).\n\n\n-----\n\nThe timing of the attacks is commensurate with the Middle-Eastern working week (Figure 6):\n\n_Figure 6- Attacks by day-of-the-week_\n\nThe sample build days-of-the-week follow an almost identical pattern (Figure 7):\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 7- Builds by day-of-the-week_\n\nWe saw five samples built on the same date in December 2015, and six on the same date in\nJanuary, further solidifying the link between each sample.\n\n## Quasar\n\nWe analyzed a Quasar sample we found that was communicating with an active C2 server at\nthe time of analysis:\n\nSHA256: 4393ff391396cdfd229517dd98aa7faecad04da479fe8ca322f035ceee363273\n\nQuasar is a publicly-available commodity RAT, an evolution of his earlier xRAT, by German\ndeveloper “MaxXor”. This sample is a modified version of Quasar, most likely forked from\n[open source version 1.2.0.0 on GitHub. The client was likely built using the Quasar server](https://github.com/quasar/QuasarRAT/tree/v1.2.0.0)\nclient builder. We observed the following customizations:\n\nC2 server:\n\napp.progsupdate[.]com, which resolved to 185.141.25[.]68), over port 4664.\n\nQuasar mutex name:\n\nVMFvdCsC7RFqerZinfV0sxJFo\n\nKeylogger log location:\n\n\n-----\n\nUsers\\hJTQwqwwSCkZU\\AppData\\Roaming\\GoogleDesktop\\<date>\n\nThe malware uses fake version information to appear as a Microsoft update program, as well\nas Google Desktop once unpacked.\n\n## Packer\n\nThis sample is packed by “Netz”, a simple .NET Framework packer which stores the original\nexecutable compressed (zlib) as a resource. At runtime, the packer decompresses the\nresource and uses Reflection to load the assembly, find its Entry point, and Invoke it.\nExtracting the payload is straight forward – we simply dump the resource and decompress it.\nAfter decompilation, the packer looks like this:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n\n\npublic static int Main(string[] args) {\ntry {\nNetzStarter.InitXR();\nAppDomain.CurrentDomain.AssemblyResolve += new\nResolveEventHandler(NetzStarter.NetzResolveEventHandler);\nreturn NetzStarter.StartApp(args);\n\n\nFind the resource and call InvokeApp:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\n\npublic static int StartApp(string[] args) {\nbyte[] resource = NetzStarter.GetResource(\"A6C24BF5-3690-4982-887E11E1B159B249\");\nreturn NetzStarter.InvokeApp(NetzStarter.GetAssembly(resource), args);\n\n\nGet the assembly object by decompressing the resource and loading it with Reflection:\n\n\n-----\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n\n\nprivate static Assembly GetAssembly(byte[] data) {\nMemoryStream memoryStream = (MemoryStream) null;\nmemoryStream = NetzStarter.UnZip(data);\nmemoryStream.Seek(0L, SeekOrigin.Begin);\nreturn Assembly.Load(memoryStream.ToArray());\n}\n\n\nAnd finally, find the entry point and invoke it:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n\n\nprivate static int InvokeApp(Assembly assembly, string[] args) {\nMethodInfo entryPoint = assembly.EntryPoint;\nParameterInfo[] parameters1 = entryPoint.GetParameters();\nobject[] parameters2 = (object[]) null;\nif (parameters1 != null && parameters1.Length > 0)\nparameters2 = new object[1]{ (object) args };\nobject obj = entryPoint.Invoke((object) null, parameters2);\n\n\nExtracting produces:\n\nSHA256: c931de65d9655a772d23e4227a627a1140d8d3c4912ca71c324421b13efa1a02\n\nThis layer uses obfuscation in an attempt to avoid detection/analysis.\n\n## Obfuscation\n\n\n-----\n\nWe discovered that the sample was obfuscated using .NET reactor. It is possible to decompile\nthe deobfuscated sample and retrieve most of the original source code but not enough to\ncompile it easily.\n\nAfter deobfuscation we extracted:\n\nSHA256: d773b12894d4a0ffb0df328e7e1aa4a7112455e88945a10471650e503eecdb3d\n\n## Quasar Code\n\nAfter decompiling the sample, we were able to document the modifications from the opensource Quasar.\n\n**Settings**\n\nThe configuration of Quasar is stored in the Settings object, which is encrypted with a\npassword which is itself stored unencrypted.\n\n\n-----\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n\n\npublic static class Settings {\npublic static string VERSION;\npublic static string HOSTS;\npublic static int RECONNECTDELAY;\npublic static string PASSWORD;     // password for encryption of communication\npublic static Environment.SpecialFolder SPECIALFOLDER;\npublic static string DIR;\npublic static string SUBFOLDER;\npublic static string INSTALLNAME;\npublic static bool INSTALL;\npublic static bool STARTUP;\npublic static string MUTEX;\npublic static string STARTUPKEY;\npublic static bool HIDEFILE;\npublic static bool ENABLELOGGER;\npublic static string ENCRYPTIONKEY;   // Encryption password of the settings\npublic static string TAG;\npublic static string LOGDIRECTORYNAME;\npublic static bool HIDELOGDIRECTORY;\npublic static bool ISCHECKIP;\npublic static int INSTARTUPFOLDER;\n\n\nModifications:\n\nThe ISCHECKIP and INSTARTUPFOLDER are not found in open source Quasar\nsamples.\n\n**Cryptography**\n\nThe sample we analyzed is using RijndaelManaged with ECB mode and PKCS7 padding.\nThe key is the SHA256 hash of the hard-coded password. The password of the sample we\nanalyzed is:\n\n“6y7u^Y&U6y7u^Y&U6y7u^Y&U”\n\nAlthough at first glance this appears somewhat complex, it is in fact a rather simple, repeated\nkeyboard sequence. We observe similar keyboard patterns in other samples: “567%^&”,\n“zxc!@#ASD”.\n\n\n-----\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n\n\npublic static void SetDefaultKey(string key) {\nbyte[] bytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(key);\nAES._defaultKey = SHA256.Create().ComputeHash(bytes);\n\nprivate static void EncDec(Stream src, Stream ds, bool encDec, byte[] key) {\nRijndaelManaged rijndaelManaged = new RijndaelManaged();\nrijndaelManaged.Key = key;\nrijndaelManaged.Mode = CipherMode.ECB;\nrijndaelManaged.Padding = PaddingMode.PKCS7;\nrijndaelManaged.BlockSize = AES.BlockSize * 8;\nif (encDec) {\nICryptoTransform encryptor = rijndaelManaged.CreateEncryptor();\nCryptoStream cryptoStream = new CryptoStream(ds, encryptor,\nCryptoStreamMode.Write);\nlong position = src.Position;\nAES.CopyTo(src, (Stream) cryptoStream, 8192);\ncryptoStream.FlushFinalBlock();\n} else {\nICryptoTransform decryptor = rijndaelManaged.CreateDecryptor();\nAES.CopyTo(new CryptoStream(src, decryptor, CryptoStreamMode.Read), ds, 8192);\n}\n}\n\n\nModifications:\n\nUses SHA256 instead of MD5 to create the key.\nUses RijndaelManaged instead of AES for encryption. (with ECB mode, which is\nconsidered weak).\n\n**Serialization**\n\nQuasar contains the NetSerializer library that handles serialization of high level IPacket\nobjects that the client and server use to communicate. The serialization assigns unique IDs\nfor serializable objects types. The open source and several other samples we found give a\ndynamically-assigned 1 byte ID at compile time. The sample we analyzed changed that\nbehavior and hard-coded DWORD for each object type. This is a better implementation, as it\nallows servers and clients from different versions to communicate with each other to some\nextent.\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n\n\nprivate static void initTypeMap() {\nExts.dict_0.Add(typeof (object), -737641570);\nExts.dict_0.Add(typeof (GetPasswordsResponse), -692037318);\nExts.dict_0.Add(typeof (List<string>), 1046249082);\nExts.dict_0.Add(typeof (int), -118636331);\nExts.dict_0.Add(typeof (string[]), -2103720204);\nExts.dict_0.Add(typeof (string), 1236129805);\n\n\n**Version**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe sample we analyzed is most likely forked from open source quasar 1.2.0.0. We find\nmultiple file/object names hinting at the version, but must compelling:\n\nQuasar version 1.1.0.0 names the encryption module name space \"Encryption\", while\nsubsequent Quasar versions use \"Cryptography\" – which we observe in this sample.\nQuasar version 1.3.0.0 changed the encryption key generation, and stopped saving the\npassword in the sample. There are more indications as well, such as names of objects,\nfiles etc.\n\nOther samples we analyzed had different combinations of modification to cryptography and\nserialization.\n\n## The C2 server\n\nOur decompilation of the serialization library was not complete enough to allow simple\nrecompilation. Instead, we downloaded and compiled the 1.2.0.0 server of the open-source\nQuasar RAT, having determined that this seemed likely the most similar version. The out-ofthe-box server could not communicate with the client sample owing to the previously\ndocumented modifications that we had observed. We incorporated those changes into our\nbuild, discovering that this worked for most sample versions with almost no further\nmodification.\n\nBoth the client and the server use the same code to serialize and encrypt the\ncommunications. Instead of compiling a different server for each client, our server uses the\ncode from within the client to communicate with it. Using Reflection, the server can load the\nassembly of the client to find the relevant functions and passwords.\n\n**Load the client assembly:**\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n\n\nprivate static System.Reflection.Assembly assembly =\nSystem.Reflection.Assembly.LoadFile(@\"C:\\Users\\user1\\Desktop\\Quasar\\ServerVersionLo\nadClient\\resource.bin.open.exe\");\n\n\n**Encryption:**\n\nRather straight forward, as the server version uses the same API as the sample client.\n\n**_Get the AES class:_**\n\n1 private static Type tAES = assembly.GetType(\"_.Cr.Crp.AES\");\n\n**_Getting the setDefKey, encrypt and decrypt methods:_**\n\n\n-----\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n\n\nprivate static System.Reflection.MethodInfo[] mi = tAES.GetMethods();\nprivate static System.Reflection.MethodInfo setDefKey = mi[1]; // this one is used\nto set the current encryption key (IE sha256 of the password stored in Settings)\n//tAES.GetMethod(\"Encrypt\"); doesn’t work, because its ambiguous as it is overridden,\nso I choose the right ones directly\nprivate static System.Reflection.MethodInfo encMIBuf = mi[4];\nprivate static System.Reflection.MethodInfo decMIBuf = mi[6];\n\n\n**_Replace the server functions:_**\n\n1 public static void SetDefaultKey(string key)\n\nwith\n\n1 public static void setDefKey.Invoke(null, new object[] { key });\n\n1 public static byte[] Encrypt(byte[] input)\n\nwith\n\n\n1\n2\n\n\npublic static byte[] encdata = (byte[])encMIBuf.Invoke(null, new object[] { input\n});\n\n\n1 public static byte[] Decrypt(byte[] input)\n\nwith\n\n1 public static byte[] data = (byte[])decMIBuf.Invoke(null, new object[] { input });\n\n## Serialization:\n\nThis was more complex. Both the client and server uses the same API, but the client\nserializer cannot serialize server objects, because they are not the same as their \"mirrored\"\nobjects inside the client. In some cases these objects are completely different, for example\nthe server commands to get the file system.\n\nOur solution is to:\n\n1. Translate on the fly the objects the server send to mirrored matching client objects (will\n\nnot work if client doesn’t have this object, or renamed it).\n2. Copy the content from the server object into the new client object (will not work if client\n\nimplementation is different).\n3. Serialize the client object (which will be later encrypted and sent).\n4. Deserialize the decrypted response into another client response object.\n\n\n-----\n\n5. Translate the client response object into the server version of the client response object.\n6. Copy the contents from the client response object into the translated server object.\n7. Return the translated object.\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n\n\npublic static void SerializeWrapper(Stream stream, object data)\n{\nSystem.Reflection.Assembly assembly =\nSystem.Reflection.Assembly.LoadFile(@\"C:\\Users\\user1\\Desktop\\Quasar\\ServerVersionL\noadClient\\resource.bin.open.exe\");\nType serializerType = assembly.GetType(\"_.Cr.NetSerializer.Serializer\");\nSystem.Reflection.PropertyInfo serInstanceProp = serializerType.GetProperty(\"Instace\");\nobject serInstance = serInstanceProp.GetGetMethod().Invoke(null, new object[] { });\nSystem.Reflection.MethodInfo serializeMet = serializerType.GetMethod(\"Serialize\");\nType typeOfData = data.GetType(); string typeOfDataFullName = typeOfData.FullName;\nstring typeOfDataFullNameNew = typeOfDataFullName.Replace(\"xServer.Core\", \"_.Cr\");\nType packType = assembly.GetType(typeOfDataFullNameNew);\nobject pacTypeInstance = packType.GetConstructor(new Type[] { }).Invoke(new object[] {\n});\n// now try to copy data into the instance\nforeach (FieldInfo fieldOfClient in packType.GetFields())\n{\nstring fieldName = fieldOfClient.Name;\nFieldInfo fieldOfServer = typeOfData.GetField(fieldName);\nPropertyInfo PropOfServer = typeOfData.GetProperty(fieldName);\nobject serverValue = null;\nif (fieldOfServer != null) {\nserverValue = fieldOfServer.GetValue(data);\n} else if (PropOfServer != null) {\nserverValue = PropOfServer.GetValue(data,null);\n} fieldOfClient.SetValue(pacTypeInstance, serverValue);\n}\nforeach (PropertyInfo fieldOfClient in packType.GetProperties())\n{\nstring fieldName = fieldOfClient.Name;\nFieldInfo fieldOfServer = typeOfData.GetField(fieldName);\nPropertyInfo PropOfServer = typeOfData.GetProperty(fieldName);\nobject serverValue = null;\nif (PropOfServer != null) {\nserverValue = PropOfServer.GetValue(data, null);\n}\nelse if (fieldOfServer != null) {\nserverValue = fieldOfServer.GetValue(data);\n}\nfieldOfClient.SetValue(pacTypeInstance, serverValue,null);\n}\nserializeMet.Invoke(serInstance, new object[] { stream, pacTypeInstance });\n}\n\npublic static object DeserializeWrapper(Stream stream) {\nSystem.Reflection.Assembly assembly =\nSystem.Reflection.Assembly.LoadFile(@\"C:\\Users\\user1\\Desktop\\Quasar\\ServerVersionL\n\n\n-----\n\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n61\n62\n63\n64\n65\n66\n67\n68\n69\n70\n71\n72\n73\n74\n75\n\n\noadClient\\resource.bin.open.exe );\nType serializerType = assembly.GetType(\"_.Cr.NetSerializer.Serializer\");\nSystem.Reflection.PropertyInfo serInstanceProp = serializerType.GetProperty(\"Instace\");\nobject serInstance = serInstanceProp.GetGetMethod().Invoke(null, new object[] { });\nSystem.Reflection.MethodInfo DeserializeMet = serializerType.GetMethod(\"Deserialize\");\nobject ob = DeserializeMet.Invoke(serInstance, new object[] { stream });\nType typeOfPacket = ob.GetType(); string typeOfPacketFullName =\ntypeOfPacket.FullName;\nstring typeOfPacketFullNameNew = typeOfPacketFullName.Replace(\"_.Cr\",\n\"xServer.Core\");\nSystem.Reflection.Assembly currentAssembly = Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly();\nType packTypeServ = currentAssembly.GetType(typeOfPacketFullNameNew);\nobject pacTypeInstance = packTypeServ.GetConstructor(new Type[] { }).Invoke(new\nobject[] { });\n\n// now try to copy data into the instance\nforeach (FieldInfo fi in typeOfPacket.GetFields()) {\nstring fieldName = fi.Name;\nFieldInfo fiServ = packTypeServ.GetField(fieldName);\nif (fiServ != null) {\nobject clientSentValue = fi.GetValue(ob);\nfiServ.SetValue(pacTypeInstance, clientSentValue);\n}\n}\nforeach (PropertyInfo fi in typeOfPacket.GetProperties()) {\nstring fieldName = fi.Name;\nPropertyInfo fiServ = packTypeServ.GetProperty(fieldName);\nif (fiServ != null) {\nobject clientSentValue = fi.GetValue(ob,null);\nfiServ.SetValue(pacTypeInstance, clientSentValue,null);\n}\n}\nreturn pacTypeInstance;\n}\n\n\n## Communication\n\nOur sample communicates with app.progsupdate[.]com, which resolved to 185.141.25[.]68,\nover TCP port 4664.\n\n## Architecture\n\nThis is the communication architecture between quasar client and server (Figure 8):\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 8- Communication Architecture_\n\n1. The server sends a command. for example, “Get System Information”.\n2. The command is translated to an IPacket of type GetSystemInfo.\n3. The packet is serialized into a stream of bytes.\n4. The stream of bytes is encrypted (in some versions there is also optional compression\n\nstep).\n5. The stream of bytes is sent over TCP to the client.\n6. The client receives and decrypts the packet.\n7. The client deserializes the packet into IPacket GetSystemInfo.\n8. The relevant handler of the client is called, collects the system information and sends it\n\nback inside IPacket of GetSystemInfoResponse.\n\nEach of these layers seems to be different to some extent in the various samples we found.\nThe IPacket, Serialization and Encryption framework code is shared between the client and\nthe server, therefore we can use it with Reflection. However the Server handlers and\ncommand function are not, so we cannot create a completely perfect simulation.\n\n## Initial handshake\n\nAfter the TCP handshake completes, the server starts another handshake with the client by\nsending packets in the following order (Figure 9):\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 9- Initial Handshake_\n\nThe client returns data to the server about the victim computer, which is displayed in the\nserver GUI (Figure 10):\n\n_Figure 10- Quasar RAT Server GUI_\n\nThe server and client then enter into a keep-alive mode, where the attacker can send\ncommands to the client and receive further responses.\n\n## RAT commands\n\nThe attacker can issue commands (not all commands appear in different samples) through\nthe Quasar server GUI for each client:\n\nGet system information\nGet file system\n\n\n-----\n\nUpload / download / execute files\nStartup manager\nOpen task manager\nKill / start processes\nEdit registry\nReverse Proxy\nShutdown / restart the computer\nOpen remote desktop connection\nObserve the desktop and actions of active user\nIssue remote mouse clicks and keyboard strokes\nPassword stealing\nRetrieve Keylogger logs\nVisit website\nDisplay a message box\n\nOur server build was able to successfully execute most of the commands.\n\nThe file system commands underling handlers and IPacket were modified to support more\nfeatures, so these commands don’t work out of the box and required manual implementation\nfrom us.\n\n## A Double-Edged Sword…\n\nWith further analysis of the Quasar RAT C2 Server, we uncovered vulnerabilities in the server\ncode, which would allow remote code execution. This might allow a second attacker to install\ncode of their choice – for example, their own Quasar RAT – on the original attacker’s server.\nWe refer to this (somewhat ironic) technique as a “Double Edged Sword Attack”. We did not\napply this to any live C2 servers – we only tested this with our own servers in our lab.\n\nIn the lab, we changed our Quasar RAT source code to use the known encryption key, and to\nsend fake victim IP address, City, Country code, Flag, and Username. The Quasar server\ndoes not verify the RAT data, and displays this data in the RAT Server GUI when the RAT is\nexecuted and connects to the server. We found this could be used to supply compelling\n“victim data” to convince the attacker to connect to this “victim” via the GUI.\n\nQuasar server includes a File Manager window, allowing the attacker to select victim files,\nand trigger file operations – for example, uploading a file from victim machine to server.\nUploaded files are written to the server sub directory\n“clients\\user_name@machine_name_ipaddress”.\n\nQuasar server does not verify that the size, filename, extension, or header of the uploaded file\nis the same as requested. Therefore, if we convince the attacker to request the file\n“secret_info.doc (20KB)”, we can instead return to the server any file of our choice, of any\nsize or type.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen the Quasar server retrieves the name of the uploaded file from the victim, it does not\nverify that it is a valid file path. Therefore sending the file path \"..\\..\\ secret_info.doc \" will\nresult in writing our file instead to the same directory as the Quasar server code.\n\nQuasar server does not even verify that a file was requested from the victim. Immediately\nwhen the File Manager window is opened by the attacker, the Quasar server sends two\ncommands to the RAT: GetDrives and listDirectory (to populate the list of the victim’s files in\nthe RAT Server GUI). We can respond to those commands by instead sending two files of our\nchoice to the Quasar server. Again, we control the content of the file, the size and the path\nand filename.\n\nQuasar is a .NET Framework assembly, loading multiple DLLs upon launch, for example\n“dnsapi.dll”. Quasar server is vulnerable to a simple DLL hijacking attack, by using this\ntechnique to replace server DLLs.\n\nWhen the attacker restarts the Quasar application, our uploaded “dnsapi.dll” will instead be\nloaded. Through this vector, we could drop our own Quasar client on the attacker’s server and\nexecute it. Our Quasar RAT will connect to our own (secured, of course) Quasar server,\nallowing us to control that attacker’s server with his own RAT. We can also replace\n“shfolder.dll” (and add a DLL export proxy to avoid a crash), which is loaded whenever the\nattacker clicks the builder tab – allowing us to infect the server while it runs, without the need\nto wait for application restart.\n\n## Downeks\n\nAlthough Downeks has been publicly examined to some extent, our analysis found several\nfeatures not previously described.\n\nEarlier Downeks samples were all written in native code. However, among our Downeks\nsamples, we found new versions apparently written in .NET. We observe many behavioral\nsimilarities and unique strings across both the native-Downeks versions, and the new .NET\nDowneks versions. Almost all of the strings and behaviors we describe in this analysis of a\n.NET version are also present in the native version.\n\nWe observed these samples deployed only against Hebrew-speaking targets.\n\n**Downeks.NET – “SharpDownloader”**\n\nDowneks .NET internal name is “SharpDownloader”, “Sharp” may be a reference to the\nlanguage it was written in – C#.\n\nAs seen in previous Downeks versions, it uses masquerades with icons, filenames and\nmetadata imitating popular legitimate applications such as VMware workstation (Figure 1) and\nCCleaner, or common file formats such as DOC and PDF.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 11 - Application metadata masquerading as VMWare Workstation_\n\nAll 3 samples were compiled with the same timestamp. Downeks.NET is obfuscated using\n[“Yano” and can be easily de-obfuscated using the de4dot utility.](https://github.com/0xd4d/de4dot)\n\nSHA256: 4dcf5bd2c7a5822831d9f22f46bd2369c4c9df17cc99eb29975b5e8ae7e88606\nSHA256: 905f6a62749ca6f0fd33345d6a8b1831d87e9fd1f81a59cd3add82643b367693\nSHA256: c885f09b10feb88d7d176fe1a01ed8b480deb42324d2bb825e96fe1408e2a35f\n\n## Communication\n\nDowneks is a backdoor with only very basic capabilities. It communicates with the C2 server\nusing HTTP POST requests.\n\nIt runs in an infinite loop, in each iteration it requests a command from the C2, and then it\nsleeps for a time period it receives in the C2 response (defaulting to 1 second if no sleep-time\nsent).\n\nThe data that is sent in the POST is serialized with json, which is then is encrypted, and finally\nencoded in base64. The json format is typically {“mth”:”some_method”,\n“data”:”some_encrypted_data”}. The C2 server responds using the same format and\nserialization/encryption/encoding.\n\n## Download and Execute\n\n\n-----\n\nAs described in earlier analyses, Downeks main purpose is as a downloader. Unfortunately,\nwe were unable to get any C2 servers to issue download commands to any samples that we\ntested in our lab.\n\nThe download is initiated upon receiving json with a “download” command, which includes the\nURL of the file to be downloaded. Downeks can also be instructed to execute binaries that\nalready exist on the victim machine. After successful execution, Downeks returns the results\nto the C2 server.\n\nDowneks also has a self-update capability, if instructed by the C2.\n\n## Screen Capture\n\nDowneks can be instructed with the “img” command to capture the victim screen and transmit\nit back to the C2. The parameters “wth” and “qlt” specify “width” and “quality”.\n\n## Appdata\n\nDowneks .NET creates a file in the “Appdata” directory, based on certain properties of the\nmachine. During our analysis, Downeks created a file in “Appdata\\Roaming” containing only\n“SD{new line} 0” (“SD” possibly for “SharpDownloader”).\n\nAlthough this file itself is not particularly interesting, the older (native) Downeks versions also\ncreates a file in Appdata\\Roaming, with identical data.\n\nThe filenames across the two variants bear striking similarities. The .NET variant creates\n“1FABFBFF0000065132F71D94”, while the native version creates “000206511FABFBFF”. We\nobserved the string “1FABFBFF0000065132F71D94” in memory during debugging of the\nnative variant (Figure 12). This is a pseudo-unique ID for each machine, based on install date\ntaken from the registry, volume serial number, OS version and service pack, Processor\narchitecture, and computer name.\n\n_Figure 12 - Machine ID in memory_\n\n## Installed Antivirus check\n\nDowneks enumerates any antivirus products installed on the victim machine and transmits the\nlist to the C2. It constructs this list using the WMI query:\n\n“SELECT displayName FROM AntivirusProduct”\n\n## Persistence\n\n\n-----\n\nDowneks achieves host persistence through either the registry “run” key or with a shortcut in\nthe start-up folder.\n\n## External IP\n\nIn another similarity between both variants, Dowenks assesses the victim’s external IP using\nan HTTP request to http://www.myexternalip.com/raw.\n\n## Other commands\n\nDowneks can be instructed by the C2 to perform a few other commands:\n\nCheck if the computer name and user name, or external IP address, is in a provided list\nand if so, display a message box with a message as defined by the C2.\nKill any running process and attempt to delete the associated executable.\n“Setup” command – sends various info about the machine with each iteration of the C2\ncommunications loop.\n\n## Encryption keys\n\nDowneks has static encryption keys hardcoded in the code. These keys are initialized in the\n“Defaults” class constructor, suggesting that the author of this malware has great affection for\nstackoverflow:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n\n\nstatic Defaults()\n{\nResEncKey = Strings.Get(0x1524);    // resolves to “$t2ck0v3rFl0w”\nRarPass = Strings.Get(0x1539);     // resolves to “123456”\nServerTransKey = Strings.Get(0x1542); // resolves to “P@$sw0rD$nd”\nDataEncKey = Strings.Get(0x1553);   // resolves to “$t@k0v2rF10w”\nConnRequestKey = Strings.Get(0x1564); // resolves to “1q@W3e$RQ!w2E#r4”\n}\n\n\n## Typos\n\nWe observed some typos in the code, such as “responce” ( “response”) and “GroubID”\n(“GroupID”) in this version.\n\n## Coverage & IoCs\n\nPalo Alto Networks customers are protected from Downeks and Quasar used in this
