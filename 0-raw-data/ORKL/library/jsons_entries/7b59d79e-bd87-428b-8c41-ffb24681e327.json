    "plain_text": "# Hack Brief: Russian Hackers Release Apparent IOC Emails in Wake of Olympics Ban\n\n**[wired.com/story/russian-fancy-bears-hackers-release-apparent-ioc-emails/](https://www.wired.com/story/russian-fancy-bears-hackers-release-apparent-ioc-emails/)**\n\nLouise Matsakis January 10, 2018\n\nOn Wednesday, in the wake of Russia's December ban from the 2018 Winter Olympics, a\nRussia-linked group calling itself \"Fancy Bears\" published a set of apparently stolen emails.\nThey purportedly belong to officials from the International Olympic Committee, the United\nStates Olympic Committee, and third-party groups associated with the organizations. It's not\nthe first time Russia has lashed out at the IOC and the anti-doping agencies in the last few\nyears. And with a month left until the games begin, it may not be the last.\n\nThe Hack\n\nThe emails appear to span from the end of 2016 to the spring of 2017, and focus on\ncorrespondence between antidoping investigators who helped uncover a wide-scale,\nsystematic doping scheme carried out by Russian athletes. It's not clear yet whether the\n[emails are entirely authentic; Russian hacking groups have snuck false information into their](https://www.wired.com/2017/05/russian-hackers-using-tainted-leaks-sow-disinformation/)\nleaks before. But the World Anti-Doping Agency Wednesday indirectly acknowledged that\nthe emails were real, but not current.\n\n\"The Fancy Bears are a criminal organization which seeks to undermine the work of WADA\nand its partners,\" says WADA spokesperson Maggie Durand. \"Everything that they have\nposted today is dated.\"\n\n\n-----\n\nThe hack appears to be retaliation for kicking the Russia out of 2018 PyeongChang games,\nat which only a handful of the country's athletes will be allowed to compete.\n\nFancy Bears—assumed to be the same hacking group known previously as Fancy Bear—\n[has been linked to Russia’s primary intelligence agency, the Main Intelligence Directorate](https://www.wired.com/story/russian-hacking-teams-infrastructure/)\n(abbreviated GRU) by American intelligence officials. On its official website, the hackers\nportrayed the stolen emails as evidence that “the Europeans and the Anglo-Saxons are\nfighting for power and cash in the sports world.” In other words, this hack looks like an\nattempt revive Russian claims that Westerners are attempting to disenfranchise the country\nby exposing its systemic cheating.\n\nWho's Affected?\n\nIt's not clear whose email account Fancy Bears may have breached, nor how many accounts\nwere affected. In the past, the group has often [relied on phishing schemes to infiltrate](https://www.wired.com/story/resist-phishing-attacks/)\ntargeted email accounts.\n\nFancy Bears has shown particular interest in discrediting Richard McLaren, a Canadian\nlawyer and professor who spent over a year investigating Russia’s widespread cheating\ntechniques. McLaren's findings provided the basis for banning Russia from the games,\nthough his reports did not explicitly recommend Russia's removal.\n\n[In one message obtained by Fancy Bears and reviewed by The New York Times, IOC lawyer](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/10/sports/olympics/russian-hackers-emails-doping.html)\nHoward Stupp complained that the WADA published McLaren’s investigations about Russian\ndoping without having discussed them with sports officials first. McLaren did not immediately\nreturn a request for comment.\n\nFancy Bears also singles out Richard Young, a Colorado lawyer who worked on McLaren’s\nteam. Young tells WIRED he hasn’t yet authenticated the emails, because they are still being\nreviewed by his law firm’s IT department. He says that from what he had heard about them, it\nwas possible that they were legitimate. The IOC also did not immediately respond a request\nfor comment.\n\nHow Serious Is This?\n\nWIRED hasn’t reviewed the entire contents of the emails, but upon first glance many appear\nto be routine logistical communications, despite Fancy Bears' efforts to sensationalize the\ncorrespondence. This isn’t the first time the hacking group has tried to stir up controversy\nabout the Olympics. In 2016, after the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro, Fancy Bear\npublished stolen medical records belonging to mostly British and American athletes on the\nsame website it published this new hack.\n\nBack then, the group attempted to discredit prominent competitors like gymnast Simone\nBiles for having taken banned medications. But Biles and others had received special\npermission to take the contraband drugs to treat legitimate medical conditions. None of the\n\n\n-----\n\nathletes had actually committed a violation.\n\nThe hack also serves as a reminder that Russian hackers remain seemingly as active as\n[ever. Security researchers believe Fancy Bear was one of two Russian hacking teams to](https://www.wired.com/2016/06/hack-brief-russias-breach-dnc-trumps-dirt/)\nbreak into to Democratic National Committee's files in 2016. It's also believed to be behind\n[other prominent hacks, both in the US and abroad.](https://www.wired.com/2017/05/us-sanctions-didnt-stop-russias-election-hacking-even-slow/)\n\nSo far, Fancy Bears obtained a small number of emails from individuals associated with the\nOlympics, though it's possible the group chose to publish only a handful of what it had\nobtained. A Twitter message sent to Fancy Bears went unanswered.\n\nOverall, Russia's latest attempt to save face on the international sports stage is far from\nconvincing. Unlike the DNC hack, which helped to sway the US presidential election, it\ndoesn't appear these emails will change the IOC's decision to ban the country.\n\n\n-----",
