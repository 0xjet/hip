The messages discovered so far contain an attachment with an .iso extension\nthat Kaspersky Lab solutions detect as Loki Bot. The malware’s key objective is to steal\npasswords from browsers, messaging applications, mail and FTP clients, and cryptocurrency\nwallets. Loki Bot dispatches all its loot to the malware owners.\n\nISO images are copies of optical discs that can be mounted in a virtual CD/DVD drive to be\nused in the same way as the originals. Whereas in days of yore users needed dedicated\nsoftware to open this type of image, today’s operating systems support the format out of the\nbox, and if you want to access the contents of the file, all you need to do is double-click.\nMalicious spam uses this type of file as a container for delivering malware, albeit rarely.\n\nAs mentioned above, hackers were sending out copies of Loki Bot to company email\naddresses that could be obtained from public sources or from the companies’ own websites.\n\nThe emailed messages were notably diverse:\n\n1. Fake notifications from well-known companies\n\n\n-----\n\nImitating messages from well-known corporations is one of the most popular tricks in\nthe hackers’ arsenal. Interestingly enough, fake emails used to be directed mostly at\ncommon users and customers, whereas now companies are increasingly the target.\n\n1. Fake notifications containing financial documents\n\n\n-----\n\nThe scammers passed off malicious files as financial documents: invoices, transfers,\npayments, etc. This is a fairly popular malicious spamming technique, with the\nmessage body usually no more than a few lines and the subject mentioning what\nexactly is purported to be attached.\n\n1. Fake orders or offers\n\n\n-----\n\nPhishers may pose as customers placing an order, or a vendor offering their goods or\nservices.\n\nEvery year we observe an increase in spam attacks on the corporate sector. The\nperpetrators have used phishing and malicious spam, including forged business emails, in\ntheir pursuit of confidential corporate information: intellectual property, authentication data,\ndatabases, bank accounts, etc. That’s why today it’s essential for corporate security\nmeasures to include both technical protection and training for employees, because their\nactions may cause irreparable damage to the business.\n\n[Phishing](https://securelist.com/tag/phishing/)\n[Spam Letters](https://securelist.com/tag/spam-letters/)\n[Spammer techniques](https://securelist.com/tag/spammer-techniques/)\n\nAuthors\n\n[Tatyana Shcherbakova](https://securelist.com/author/tatyanashcherbakova/)\n\nLoki Bot: On a hunt for corporate passwords\n\n\n-----\n\nYour email address will not be published.

In this report we describe how the MoonBounce\nimplant works and how it is connected to APT41.\n\n## The BlueNoroff cryptocurrency hunt is still on\n\nIt appears that BlueNoroff shifted focus from hitting banks and SWIFT-connected servers to\nsolely cryptocurrency businesses as the main source of the group’s illegal income.\n\nSubscribe to our weekly e-mails\n\nThe hottest research right in your inbox\n\n\n-----\n\n-----",
