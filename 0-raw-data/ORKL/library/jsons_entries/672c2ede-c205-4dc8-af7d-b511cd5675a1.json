The group uses an**\n\n**[advanced piece of malware known as Remsec (Backdoor.Remsec) to conduct its attacks.](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2016-080214-3543-99)**\n\n**Remsec is a stealthy tool that appears to be primarily designed for spying purposes. Its**\n\n**code contains a reference to Sauron, the all-seeing antagonist in Lord of the Rings.**\n\n**[Strider’s attacks have tentative links with a previously uncovered group, Flamer. The use of](http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/flamer-highly-sophisticated-and-discreet-threat-targets-middle-east)**\n\n**Lua modules, which we’ll discuss later, is a technique that has previously been used by**\n\n**[Flamer. One of Strider’s targets had also previously been infected by Regin.](http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/regin-top-tier-espionage-tool-enables-stealthy-surveillance)**\n\n**Background**\n\n**Strider has been active since at least October 2011. The group has maintained a low profile**\n\n**until now and its targets have been mainly organizations and individuals that would be of**\n\n**interest to a nation state’s intelligence services. Symantec obtained a sample of the group’s**\n\n**Remsec malware from a customer who submitted it following its detection by our behavioral**\n\n**engine.**\n\n**Remsec is primarily designed to spy on targets. It opens a back door on an infected**\n\n**computer, can log keystrokes, and steal files.**\n\n**Targets**\n\n**Strider has been highly selective in its choice of targets and, to date, Symantec has found**\n\n**evidence of infections in 36 computers across seven separate organizations. The group’s**\n\n**targets include a number of organizations and individuals located in Russia, an airline in**\n\n**China, an organization in Sweden, and an embassy in Belgium.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Figure 1. Only a small number of organizations in four countries are impacted by Strider_**\n\n**Stealthy back door**\n\n**The Remsec malware used by Strider has a modular design. Its modules work together as**\n\n**a framework that provides the attackers with complete control over an infected computer,**\n\n**allowing them to move across a network, exfiltrate data, and deploy custom modules as**\n\n**required.**\n\n**Remsec contains a number of stealth features that help it to avoid detection. Several of its**\n\n**components are in the form of executable blobs (Binary Large Objects), which are more**\n\n**difficult for traditional antivirus software to detect. In addition to this, much of the malware’s**\n\n**functionality is deployed over the network, meaning it resides only in a computer’s memory**\n\n**and is never stored on disk. This also makes the malware more difficult to detect and**\n\n**indicates that the Strider group are technically competent attackers.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Loader: Named MSAOSSPC.DLL, this module is responsible for loading files from disk�**\n\n**and executing them. The files on disk contain the payload in an executable blob format.�**\n\n**The loader also logs data. Executable blobs and data are encrypted and decrypted**\n\n**with a repeating key of 0xBAADF00D. The loader maintains persistence by being**\n\n**implemented as a fake Security Support Provider.**\n\n**Lua modules: Several examples of Remsec use modules written in the Lua**\n\n**programming language. Remsec uses a Lua interpreter to run Lua modules which**\n\n**perform various functions. These Lua modules are stored in the same executable blob**\n\n**format as the loader. Lua modules include:**\n\n**Network loader – This loads an executable over the network for execution. It may**\n\n**use RSA/RC6 encryption.**\n\n**Host loader – This is used to decrypt and load at least three other Lua modules into**\n\n**running processes. It references three named modules: ilpsend, updater (neither of**\n\n**which has been discovered to date), and, kblog (likely the Keylogger module detailed**\n\n**below).**\n\n**Keylogger – This logs keystrokes and exfiltrates this data to a server under the�**\n\n**attackers’ control. This is the module that contains a string named “Sauron” in its**\n\n**code. Given its capabilities, it is possible the attackers have nicknamed the module**\n\n**after the all-seeing villain in Lord of the Rings.**\n\n**_Figure 2. String referencing Sauron in Remsec keylogger module_**\n\n**Network listener: A number of examples of Remsec implement different techniques**\n\n**for opening a network connection based on monitoring for specific types of traffic.�**\n\n**These include ICMP, PCAP, and RAW network sockets.**\n\n**Basic pipe back door: This is a minimal back door module, controlled over named**\n\n**pipes. It can execute data in the format of the executable blob or a standard**\n\n**executable.**\n\n**Advanced pipe back door: This offers several more commands than the basic**\n\n**version, including sending the executable blob, listing files, and reading/writing/deleting�**\n\n**files.�**\n\n**HTTP back door: This module includes several URLs for a command and control**\n\n**(C&C) server.**\n\n**Strider is capable of creating custom malware tools and has operated below the radar for at**\n\n**least five years Based on the espionage capabilities of its malware and the nature of its**\n\n\n-----\n\n**continue to search for more Remsec modules and targets in order to build upon our**\n\n**understanding of Strider and better protect our customers.**\n\n**Protection**\n\n**[Symantec and Norton products detect this threat as Backdoor.Remsec.](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2016-080214-3543-99)**\n\n**Indicators of compromise**\n\n**[We have also compiled an indicators-of-compromise document containing further details](http://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/Symantec_Remsec_IOCs.pdf)**\n\n**which can be used to help identify the threats if they are present in your environment.**\n\n**Tags: Security, Security Response, Endpoint Protection (AntiVirus), Backdoor.Remsec, Belgium, China**\n\n**Cyberespionage, Flamer, Lord of the Rings, LOTR, Malware, Regin, Russia, Sauron, Strider, Sweden**\n\n**Subscriptions (0)**\n\n**Symantec Security Response**\n\n**View Profile�**\n\n\n**Login or Register to post comments.**\n\n\n-----",
