Darkside was used in the Colonial Pipeline](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-04/hackers-breached-colonial-pipeline-using-compromised-password)\n\n\n-----\n\n[ransomware attack in May 2021. The extreme amount of public and law enforcement](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-04/hackers-breached-colonial-pipeline-using-compromised-password)\nattention that attack attracted led Coreid to shut down Darkside and replace it with\nBlackMatter. Coreid runs a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operation, which means it\ndevelops the ransomware but it is deployed by affiliates for a cut of the profits. The\nransomware being deployed by different affiliates can sometimes explain the different TTPs\nand attack chains used in Noberus attacks.\n\n[Noberus sparked interest when it was first seen in November 2021 because it was coded in](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/noberus-blackcat-alphv-rust-ransomware)\nRust, and this was the first time we had seen a professional ransomware strain used in realworld attacks coded in that programming language. Rust is a notable language as it is crossplatform. Coreid claims that Noberus is capable of encrypting files on Windows, EXSI,\nDebian, ReadyNAS, and Synology operating systems.\n\nNoberus emerged shortly after BlackMatter announced it was being retired. Coreid sets out\nin the rules of its affiliate program that Noberus cannot be used to attack:\n\nThe Commonwealth of Independent States or neighboring countries\nOrganizations in or related to the healthcare sector\nCharitable or non-profit organizations\nAffiliates are also advised to avoid attacking the education and government sectors.\n\nWhen announcing Noberus, Coreid underlined the features that appeared designed to\nemphasize its superiority to rival ransomware, including that each advert is provided with an\nentrance through its own unique onion domain; the affiliate program architecturally excludes\nall possible connections with forums; even if a full-fledged command line shell is obtained,\nthe attacker will not be able to reveal the real IP address of the server, and encrypted\nnegotiation chats that can only be accessed by the intended victim.\n\nThe ransomware also offered two encryption algorithms (ChaCha20 and AES), as well as\nfour encryption modes - Full, Fast, DotPattern and SmartPattern. Full is the most secure but\nalso the slowest mode. SmartPattern offers encryption of “N” megabytes in percentage\nincrements. By default, it encrypts with a strip of 10 megabytes every 10 percent of the file\nstarting from the header, which would be an optimal mode for attackers in terms of speed\nand cryptographic strength. Sentinel Labs recently published a report where it referred to this\n[kind of encryption as “intermittent encryption” and mentioned how it had been adopted by](https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/crimeware-trends-ransomware-developers-turn-to-intermittent-encryption-to-evade-detection/)\ncertain ransomware operators, including Noberus, Black Basta, and more.\n\nThe percentage of each ransom that is paid to Noberus affiliates varies depending on the\nransom amount. Coreid has continuously updated Noberus since its launch in November\n2021 to make its operation more efficient. They will also cull affiliates if they are not bringing\nin enough money, encouraging them to “contact less professional teams”. In December\n2021, the ransomware added a new “Plus” role for affiliates that had brought in more than\n$1.5 million. It gave access to:\n\n\n-----\n\nDDoS - used to target domains with DDoS attacks\nCalls - adding a field to indicate the phone numbers of the victim or add a contact\nnumber for the affiliate to communicate directly with victims if they wish\nBrute - making it possible to brute force NTDS, Kerberos tickets and other hashes for\nfree\n\nCoreid made a major update to Noberus in June 2022, which included:\n\nIntroducing an ARM build for encryption of non-standard architectures\nIntroducing SAFEMODE - Added encryption functionality to the Windows build via\nrebooting into safe mode (--safeboot) and safe mode with networking (--safebootnetwork)\n\nCoreid also made some updates to the locker, by adding new restart logic, and simplifying\nthe Linux encryption process. In a July 2022 update the team added indexing of stolen data meaning its data leaks websites can be searched by keyword, file type, and more.\n\nThe continuous updating and refining of Noberus’ operations shows that Coreid is constantly\nadapting its ransomware operation to ensure it remains as effective as possible. The FBI\nissued a warning in April 2022 saying that between November 2021 and March 2022 at least\n60 organizations worldwide had been compromised with the Noberus ransomware - the\nnumber of victims now is likely to be many multiples of that.\n\n## Noberus and Exmatter: New version of data exfiltration tool used in ransomware attacks\n\nIn August 2022, a heavily updated version of the Exmatter (Trojan.Exmatter) data exfiltration\ntool was observed being used alongside Noberus in ransomware attacks.\n\nExmatter was discovered by Symantec researchers in November 2021 being used alongside\nthe Blackmatter ransomware. It was designed to steal specific file types from a number of\nselected directories and upload them to an attacker-controlled server prior to deployment of\nthe ransomware itself on the victim’s network. Even at the time of its discovery, various\nvariants of the tool were seen, as its developers continued to refine it to optimize its\noperation and expedite exfiltration of a sufficient volume of high-value data in as short a time\nas possible.\n\nThis latest version of Exmatter has reduced the number of file types it attempts to exfiltrate. It\nwill now exfiltrate files with the following extensions only:\n\n.pdf, .doc, .docx, .xls, .xlsx, .png, .jpg, .jpeg, .txt, .bmp, .rdp, .txt, .sql, .msg, .pst, .zip,\n.rtf, .ipt, .dwg\n\nOther new features include:\n\n\n-----\n\nAddition of third exfiltration capability (FTP) to SFTP and WebDav, which were present\nin older versions.\nReports: Ability to build a report listing all processed files.\nEraser: Can corrupt processed files (not turned on in version analyzed).\nSelf-destruct: Configuration option, which, when enabled, will make the tool selfdestruct and quit if executed in a non-corporate environment (outside of a Windows\ndomain).\nSocks5: Socks5 support was removed.\nIn at least one attack, the tool was deployed via GPO.\n\nIn addition to this, the malware was extensively rewritten, and even existing features were\nimplemented differently. This was possibly a bid to avoid detection. Whether Exmatter is the\ncreation of Coreid or a skilled affiliate of the group is not clear, but its use alongside two\ndifferent iterations of Coreid’s ransomware is notable. Its continuous development also\nunderlines the focus of the group on data theft and extortion, and the importance of this\nelement of attacks to ransomware actors now.\n\n## Noberus and Eamfo: Attackers using malware to steal credentials from Veeam\n\nAt least one affiliate of the Noberus ransomware operation was spotted in late August using\ninformation-stealing malware that is designed to steal credentials stored by Veeam backup\nsoftware. Veeam is capable of storing credentials for a wide range of systems, including\ndomain controllers and cloud services. The credentials are stored to facilitate the backup of\nthese systems. The malware (Infostealer.Eamfo) is designed to connect to the SQL database\nwhere Veeam stores credentials, and it steal credentials with the following SQL query:\n\nselect [user_name],[password],[description] FROM [VeeamBackup].[dbo].[Credentials]\n\nEamfo will then decrypt and display the credentials.\n\nEamfo appears to have been in existence since at least August 2021 and there is evidence\nthat it has previously been used by attackers using the Yanluowang and LockBit ransomware\nfamilies. A recent report from BlackBerry also detailed Eamfo being used alongside a new\nransomware strain it dubbed Monti, which appears to be based on the leaked source code of\nthe Conti ransomware. The TTPs used in Monti attacks also closely resemble former Conti\nattack chains, suggesting those behind Monti may be former affiliates of that group. Conti\nwas developed by a group Symantec tracks as Miner.\n\nStealing credentials from Veeam [is a known attack technique that can facilitate privilege](https://blog.checkymander.com/red%20team/veeam/decrypt-veeam-passwords/)\nescalation and lateral movement, providing the attackers with access to more data they can\npotentially exfiltrate and more machines to encrypt.\n\n\n-----\n\nNoberus attacks involving Eamfo seen by Symantec also utilized GMER, a relatively old\nrootkit scanner that can be leveraged by ransomware actors to kill processes. GMER usage\nby ransomware attackers appears to have become more frequent in recent months, and it\nwas also seen in the Monti attack detailed by BlackBerry.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThere’s no doubt that Coreid is one of the most dangerous and active ransomware\ndevelopers operating at the moment. The group has been around since 2012, and became\nwell-known for using its Carbanak malware to steal money from organizations worldwide,\nwith the banking, hospitality and retail sectors among its preferred targets. Three members of\nthe group were arrested in 2018, and in 2020 the group changed its tactics and launched its\nransomware-as-a-service operation. Its continuous development of its ransomware and its\naffiliate programs indicates that this sophisticated and well-resourced attacker has little\nintention of going anywhere anytime soon.\n\n## Protection/Mitigation\n\n[For the latest protection updates, please visit the Symantec Protection Bulletin.](https://www.broadcom.com/support/security-center/protection-bulletin)\n\n## Indicators of Compromise\n\n**File hashes (SHA256)**\n\nad5002c8a4621efbd354d58a71427c157e4b2805cb86f434d724fc77068f1c40 –\nTrojan.Exmatter\n\n8c5b108eab6a397bed4c099f13eed52aeeec37cc214423bde07544b44a62e74a –\nRansom.Noberus\n\n78517fb07ee5292da627c234b26b555413a459f8d7a9641e4a9fcc1099f06a3d –\nInfostealer.Eamfo\n\n9aa1f37517458d635eae4f9b43cb4770880ea0ee171e7e4ad155bbdee0cbe732 –\nInfostealer.Eamfo\n\ndf492b4cc7f644ad3e795155926d1fc8ece7327c0c5c8ea45561f24f5110ce54 –\nInfostealer.Eamfo\n\n029dde7c2ec880fb3d3e95e6a8376739b4bc46a0ce24012e064b904e6ecb672c –\nRansom.Noberus\n\n72f0981f18b969db2781e874d249d8003c07f99786e217f84cf54a148de259cc –\nRansom.Noberus\n\n\n-----\n\n18c909a2b8c5e16821d6ef908f56881aa0ecceeaccb5fa1e54995935fcfd12f7 – GMER Driver\n\ne8a3e804a96c716a3e9b69195db6ffb0d33e2433af871e4d4e1eab3097237173 – GMER\n\ned6275195cf9fd758fb7f8bce868c14dc9e9d6b7aa6f472f714bce5ed7fabf7f – Masqueraded\nPAExec\n\n5799d554307906e92749a0c45f21baff28d83b1cedccbf7cb6f2b98ac1b00930 – Masqueraded\nPAExec\n\n**File Names**\n\nsync_enc.exe\n\nwithout_cert.exe\n\nvup.exe\n\nmorph.exe\n\nlocker.exe\n\nisgmer.exe\n\nkgeyauow.sys\n\n## About the Author\n\n### Threat Hunter Team\n\n**Symantec**\n\nThe Threat Hunter Team is a group of security experts within Symantec whose mission is to\ninvestigate targeted attacks, drive enhanced protection in Symantec products, and offer\nanalysis that helps customers respond to attacks.\n\n\n-----",
