The implant itself is a VBS script with functionality to collect system\ninformation and execute arbitrary code sent by the attackers on the infected machine.\n\nAlthough these intrusion sets may appear similar to the new MuddyWater first stage VBS\nimplant used for reconnaissance and profiling activities, which we described recently in a\nprivate report, they have slightly different TTPs and wider targeting. To date, most of the\nknown victims are located in the Middle East, but there are also targets in other regions.\nVarious industries are affected by this campaign. The main focus is on government and\ndiplomatic entities, though we also noticed an unusual targeting of law firms and financial\ninstitutions.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe attribute this campaign with high confidence to an actor named WIRTE, which is a\n[lesser-known threat actor first publicly referenced by our colleagues at Lab52 in 2019. We](https://lab52.io/blog/wirte-group-attacking-the-middle-east/)\nfurther suspect, with low confidence, that the WIRTE group has relations with the Gaza\nCybergang threat actor.\n\nMore information about WIRTE is available to customers of Kaspersky Intelligence\nReporting. Contact: intelreports@kaspersky.com”\n\n## Gaining an initial foothold\n\nIn the instances we have observed, the threat actor sent spear-phishing emails, luring the\nvictims to open a malicious Microsoft Excel/Word document. The Excel droppers observed in\n[all instances were using Excel 4.0 macros – a technique that uses formulas in hidden](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/working-with-excel-4-0-macros-ba8924d4-e157-4bb2-8d76-2c07ff02e0b8)\nspreadsheets or cells that execute macro 4.0 commands – to drop malware that in our\nparticular case was named Ferocious dropper. The Word droppers were using standard VBA\nmacros to download the payload. The actor tailored the decoy contents to the targeted\nvictims, using logos and themes relevant to the targeted company or using trending topics\nfrom their region and, in one instance, even mimicking the Palestinian authority.\n\nHowever, in some cases we saw a fake ‘Kaspersky Update Agent’ executable acting as a\ndropper for the VBS implant. We were unable to confirm if this PE file was also distributed\nthrough email or downloaded by the threat actor after some initial penetration, but our\nanalysis shows it has the same execution flow as the Excel 4.0 macros.\n\n**_Sample VBS dropper Excel and Word documents, and executable_**\n\n\n-----\n\n## Exploitation, installation and persistence\n\n### Ferocious dropper\n\nThis first stage implant is composed of VBS and PowerShell scripts. The actor used some\ninteresting new techniques in the dropper’s execution flow. Below, we break it down into\nthree parts:\n\n1. Ferocious dropper: The Excel dropper, after the user opens it and disables the\n\nprotected mode, will execute a series of formulas placed in a hidden column. Initially,\nthey will hide the main spreadsheet that requested the user to “enable editing”, then\nunhide a secondary spreadsheet that contains the decoy, to avoid raising suspicion.\nThe dropper will then run formulas from a third spreadsheet with hidden columns. The\ninfection process will start by running three basic anti-sandbox checks using the Excel\n4.0 function “GET.WORKSPACE”, with three integers:\n\n**1: Get the name of the environment in which Microsoft Excel is running, as text,**\nfollowed by the environment’s version number. The result will then be compared\nto a predefined Windows version in a hidden cell, for example: Windows (64-bit)\nNT :.00, Windows (64-bit) NT 6.01, Windows (32-bit) NT 10.00, Windows (32-bit)\nNT 6.02.\n\n**19: Check if a mouse is present.**\n\n**42: Check if the host computer is capable of playing sounds.**\n\nIf any of the above checks fail, or if the Windows environment matches any of the\naforementioned versions predefined in the document (different documents have\ndifferent predefined versions), the process will halt. Otherwise, the macro will\nopen a temporary %ProgramData%\\winrm.txt file and save a VBS stager to\n%ProgramData%\\winrm.vbs and set up registry keys for persistence.\n\n\n-----\n\n2. Ferocious run-1: After the macro finishes writing to disk, it runs winrm.vbs using\n\nexplorer.exe. In turn, the VBS script will write an embedded PowerShell snippet to a\npredefined filename that varies between samples, for instance,\n%ProgramData%\\regionh.txt. The VBS script will also add two important registry keys\nfor persistence.\n\n[The persistence technique observed in all intrusions uses COM hijacking. In this](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/015/)\ntechnique, the threat actor is able to add a Class ID in the current user registry hive\n(HKCU) referencing the malicious VBS script written previously to\n%ProgramData%\\winrm.vbs. This registry modification will effectively invoke the\nmalicious VBS script any time a program or script references “Scripting.Dictionary”\nCOM programs during their execution.\n\nIn our analysis and testing, the WinRM Scripting API that is called by the legitimate\nWindows VBS scripts “C:\\Windows\\System32\\winrm.vbs” or\n“C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\winrm.vbs”, are able to trigger the persistence mechanism\nsmoothly. Microsoft’s command line licensing tool slmgr.vbs is also able to provide\nsimilar results. Both winrm.vbs and slmgr.vbs were leveraged across different\nintrusions. The mechanism through which these scripts are invoked during the boot\nprocess is described in a later section.\n\n**Registry keys used for COM hijacking**\n\nAfter the above execution chain, the Excel 4.0 macro will clean up and delete the\nwinrm.vbs and winrm.txt files.\n\n3. Ferocious run-2: The macro will continue after the cleanup by recreating and opening\n\nthe same files, winrm.vbs and winrm.txt. However, this time it writes a PowerShell oneliner wrapped with VB code temporarily into %ProgramData%\\winrm.txt and then saved\ninto %ProgramData%\\winrm.vbs. This one-liner acts as a stager for the PowerShell\nsnippet written in regionh.txt mentioned above. Once successful, the macro invokes\n%ProgramData%\\winrm.vbs again using explorer.exe, which in turn will execute the\nPowerShell snippet that connects to the C2 server and which we named LitePower\nStager.\n\n### LitePower stager\n\nThe implant is a small PowerShell script that acts as a downloader and secondary stager\nused to execute commands provided by its C2, and possibly download and deploy further\nmalware.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_LitePower PowerShell implant_**\n\nThis script is able to connect with the embedded C2 domain using predefined HTTP settings\nsuch as a unique User-Agent:\n\n1 Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:FTS_06) Gecko/22.36.35.06 Firefox/2.0\n\nInterestingly, and across the different incidents we observed, the “rv” field of the user agent\nhas changed. In the example above, it is FTS_06. However, we have seen more than 10\nvariations. We suspect these are used to track intrusions.\n\nIf the connection to the C2 server is successful, the script parses the output and invokes it\nusing IEX. The script sleeps for a random number of seconds between 60 and 100 after\neach attempt to reach the C2. If the threat actor succeeds in establishing C2\ncommunications using LitePower, further payloads containing system commands are sent\nback to the victim in the form of PowerShell functions through HTTP GET requests, and the\ncommand results are sent back as HTTP POST requests to the C2 server. The GET\nrequests will be parsed by LitePower and invoked using PowerShell’s IEX function.\n\nThe threat actor initially conducts system reconnaissance to assess the AV software installed\nand the user privilege. This is followed by the creation of a legitimate scheduled task to\ntrigger “Scripting.Dictionary” COM programs; this will become the cornerstone that allows the\npersistence to work using the COM hijacking technique and the registry keys added during\nthe installation phase described above.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Sample scheduled task settings referencing SLMGR.VBS to trigger WINRM.VBS_**\n**_through COM hijacking_**\n\nThe commands observed during the different intrusions are summarized below:\n\n**Command** **Description**\n\n\nGet-WmiObject Win32_logicaldisk -Filter ‘DeviceID=”C:”’ |\n\nselect volumeserialnumber\n\n‘SELECT * FROM AntiVirusProduct’\n\n$antivirusProduct = Get-WmiObject -Namespace\n‘root\\SecurityCenter2’ -Query $wmiQuery\n\nif($antivirusProduct.displayName -eq ”){$ret= ‘N/A’}\n\nelse{$ret= $antivirusProduct.displayName}\n\n\nList local disk drives\n\nGet list of antivirus\nsoftware installed\n\n\n-----\n\nNew-Object\nSecurity.Principal.WindowsPrincipal([Security.Principal.WindowsId\n\nentity]::GetCurrent())).IsInRole([Security.Principal.WindowsBuilt\n\ninRole]::Administrator\n\nGet-WmiObject win32_operatingsystem).caption) + ‘ x’+ ((Get\nWmiObject\nWin32_OperatingSystem).OSArchitecture).substring(0,2)\n\n\nCheck if current user\nhas admin privileges\n\nGet operating system\narchitecture\n\n\nAdditional long functions that we observed can be summarized as follows:\n\nFunction Get-ServiceStatus: checks for possible backdoors installed as services\n(MsDataSvc and NgcCtrlSvc), if the computer is part of a domain, and if the current\nuser is a member of “Domain admins”.\nFunction Get-PersistenceStatus: checks for the registry keys added for COM hijacking.\nFunction Get-HotFixes: lists all hotfixes installed.\nScreenshot: takes system screenshots and saves them to %AppData% before sending\nthem to the C2 via a POST request.\n\n## Command and control\n\nIn our initial sample analysis, the C2 domain we observed was stgeorgebankers[.]com. After\nconducting pivots through malware samples, we were able to identify multiple C2 domains\nthat date back to at least December 2019. These C2 domains were occasionally behind\nCloudFlare to obscure the real C2 IP address. Thanks to collaboration with our partners, we\nwere able to gather some of the original C2 IP addresses, which allowed us to discover that\nthe servers are hosted in Ukraine and Estonia.\n\n\n-----\n\n**_Infrastructure overview_**\n\nBy looking for more machines presenting identical TLS certificates, we were able to identify\nadditional domain names and IP addresses. Interestingly, the server mapped to\nkneeexercises[.]net listens for incoming HTTPS connections on several ports and uses\ncommon names seen on other C2 domains. For example, ports 2083 and 8443 had CN\nfirstohiobank[.]com, and TCP port 2087 had a TLS certificate with the common name\ndentalmatrix[.]net. We observed use of these non-standard ports during some of the older\nintrusions, while the newer ones mostly use port 443.\n\n## Victimology\n\nOur telemetry indicates that the threat actor has targeted a variety of verticals including\ndiplomatic and financial institutions, government, law firms, military organizations, and\ntechnology companies. The affected entities are located in Armenia, Cyprus, Egypt, Jordan,\nLebanon, Palestine, Syria and Turkey.\n\n## Threat actor assessment\n\nWe assess with high confidence that the intrusions discussed here are associated with the\nWIRTE threat actor group.\n\nWIRTE used documents deploying Visual Basic Script (VBS), potentially delivered through\nspear phishing, decoys with Arabic content, occasionally associated with Palestinian matters.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe see the same theme being followed in the intrusions discussed in this report. Both old\nand new intrusions leveraged VBS and PowerShell in similar ways to stage additional tools\nand communicate with the C2.\n\nEven though the latest intrusions are using TCP/443 over HTTPS in C2 communications, the\noldest intrusions explored in this report used similar ports to those mentioned in the public\npost by Lab52, such as TCP 2096 and 2087. In addition, the C2 requests explored here and\nin the public post have similar PowerShell IEX command execution and sleep functions.\n\n**_Old C2 request highlighting the status condition, IEX invocation and 60-100 sleep_**\n**_function_**\n\n**_New C2 request highlighting the status condition, IEX invocation and 60-100 sleep_**\n**_function_**\n\nThe snippets above also show the custom user-agents. Although the old intrusions had them\nencoded, the intrusions explored in this report had them in plain text. In both cases the\nadversaries identified separate intrusions by changing the “rv” field.\n\nThe C2s in both cases were protected by Cloudflare, and the real VPSs were under ASNs\nprimarily in Ukraine (e.g., ASN 201094).\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the Lab52 post, the author described the use of a defense evasion and living-off-the-land\n(LotL) technique using regsvr32.exe, whereas in the intrusions explored in this report, the\nthreat actor used another LotL technique such as COM hijacking. In both cases, the working\ndirectory is %ProgramData%.\n\nAll in all, we believe that all these similarities are a strong indication that the attacks\ndescribed in this report were conducted by the WIRTE threat actor.\n\nWe assess with low confidence that WIRTE is a subgroup under the Gaza Cybergang\numbrella. Although the three subgroups we are tracking use entirely different TTPs, they all\noccasionally use decoys associated with Palestinian matters, which we haven’t seen\ncommonly used by other threat actors, especially those operating in the Middle East region\nsuch as MuddyWater and Oilrig.\n\n## Conclusion and outlook\n\nWIRTE operators use simple and rather common TTPs that have allowed them to remain\nundetected for a long period of time. If our assessment of associating WIRTE with Gaza\nCybergang proves to be correct in the future, it may signal a change in the group’s\nmotivation. Gaza Cybergang is politically motivated and therefore primarily targets\ngovernmental and political entities; it is unusual for such groups to target law firms and\nfinancial institutions. Despite the targeting of these latter spheres, the majority of victims still\nfall within the government and diplomatic categories.\n\nWIRTE modified their toolset and how they operate to remain stealthy for a longer period of\ntime. Living-off-the-land (LotL) techniques are an interesting new addition to their TTPs. This\nsuspected subgroup of Gaza Cybergang used simple yet effective methods to compromise\nits victims with better OpSec than its suspected counterparts. Using interpreted language\nmalware such as VBS and PowerShell scripts, unlike the other Gaza Cybergang subgroups,\nadds flexibility to update their toolset and avoid static detection controls.\n\nWhether WIRTE is a new subgroup or an evolution of existing Gaza Cybergang subgroups,\nwe see them expanding their presence further in cyberspace by using updated and stealthier\nTTPs. In the near future we expect them to continue compromising their victims using the\nTTPs discussed in this report.\n\n## Indicators of compromise\n\n### Malicious documents and droppers\n\n[ecaaab9e2fc089eefb6accae9750ac60](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/ecaaab9e2fc089eefb6accae9750ac60/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL) xls.اﻟﻼﺋﺤﺔ اﻟﺠﻨﯿﺴﯿﺔ\n\n[a7802c9a4046edbcbe3f5a503de61867](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/a7802c9a4046edbcbe3f5a503de61867/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL) doc.1803202155-ﺗﻌﻤﯿﻢ رﻗﻢ\n\n\n-----\n\n[3a7425539f8853e7b89624890a5de25b](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/3a7425539f8853e7b89624890a5de25b/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL) saint george bankers & trust business\noffer.docx\n\n[5AE4505A5CA7235C842680C557D05383](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/5AE4505A5CA7235C842680C557D05383/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL) slmgr.vbs\n\n[B2F8CCE7B03E7AA70DAB4A5D377375B5](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/B2F8CCE7B03E7AA70DAB4A5D377375B5/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL) exhaustedq.txt\n\n[8ade05c4b4e98cc89fa09bd513ea1a99](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/8ade05c4b4e98cc89fa09bd513ea1a99/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL) kaspersky update agent.exe\n\n### Class IDs in registry\n\nHKCU:\\Software\\Classes\\CLSID\\{50236F14-2C02-4291-93ABB5A80F9666B0}\\LocalServer32\n\nHKCU:\\Software\\Classes\\CLSID\\{14C34482-E07F-44CF-B261385B616C54EC}\\LocalServer32\n\n### File path\n\n%AppData%\\Temp\\9127.tmp\\9128.tmp\\\n\n%ProgramData%\\\n\n### PDB paths\n\nK:\\Hacking\\NgcCtrlSvc\\NgcCtrlSvc\\obj\\Release\\NgcCtrlSvc.pdb\n\nK:\\Hacking\\Tools\\MsDataSvc-v3\\MsDataSvc\\obj\\Release\\MsDataSvc.pdb\n\n### Domains and IPs\n\n[nutrition-information[.]org](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/nutrition-information.org/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\n[Stgeorgebankers[.]com](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/Stgeorgebankers.com/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\n[Firstohiobank[.]com](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/Firstohiobank.com/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\n[allaccounting[.]ca](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/allaccounting.ca/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\n[est-clinic[.]com](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/est-clinic.com/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\n[unitedfamilyhealth[.]net](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/unitedfamilyhealth.net/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\n[pocket-property[.]com](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/pocket-property.com/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\n[kneeexercises[.]net](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/kneeexercises.net/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\n[doctoressolis[.]com](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/doctoressolis.com/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\n[omegaeyehospital[.]com](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/omegaeyehospital.com/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\n[Healthyhabitsusa[.]com](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/Healthyhabitsusa.com/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\n[niftybuysellchart[.]com](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/niftybuysellchart.com/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\n[Dentalmatrix[.]net](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/Dentalmatrix.net/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\n[91.211.89[.]33](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/91.211.89.33/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\n[91.203.6[.]27](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/91.203.6.27/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\n[45.129.96[.]174](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/45.129.96.174/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\n[45.129.97[.]207](https://opentip.kaspersky.com/45.129.97.207/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL)\n\n\n-----\n\n[APT](https://securelist.com/tag/apt/)\n[Cybercrime](https://securelist.com/tag/cybercrime/)\n[Macros](https://securelist.com/tag/macros/)\n[Malicious spam](https://securelist.com/tag/malicious-spam/)\n[Microsoft Excel](https://securelist.com/tag/microsoft-excel/)\n[Microsoft Word](https://securelist.com/tag/microsoft-word/)\n[Spear phishing](https://securelist.com/tag/spear-phishing/)\n[Targeted attacks](https://securelist.com/tag/targeted-attacks/)\n\nAuthors\n\nMaher Yamout\n\nWIRTE’s campaign in the Middle East ‘living off the land’ since at least 2019\n\nYour email address will not be published.
