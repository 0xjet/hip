Unit 42 tracks this and related activity as the group named SolarStorm, and has\n[published an ATOM containing the observed techniques, IOCs and relevant courses of action in the Unit 42 ATOM Viewer.](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/atoms/solarstorm/)\nAccording to FireEye, SolarStorm has compromised organizations across the globe via a supply chain attack that consists of\na trojanized update file for the SolarWinds Orion Platform.\n\nFireEye’s blog, “Highly Evasive Attacker Leverages SolarWinds Supply Chain to Compromise Multiple Global Victims with\nSUNBURST Backdoor,” contains a wealth of useful information, all of which has been analyzed by Unit 42 researchers to\nhelp ensure Palo Alto Networks customers are protected.\n\nAny organization utilizing SolarWinds Orion IT management software is potentially at risk from this threat. These\norganizations should immediately identify Orion systems in their network, determine if they are compromised with the\nSUNBURST backdoor and seek out further evidence of compromise. Instructions on how to perform these tasks using the\n[Palo Alto Networks Next Generation Firewall,](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/fireeye-solarstorm-sunburst/2) [Cortex XDR and XSOAR are available in this report, as well as additional](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/fireeye-solarstorm-sunburst/3)\nresources and indicators of compromise (IOCs). Palo Alto Networks has also launched SolarStorm Rapid Response\nPrograms.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe details of this attack and its impact continue to evolve. We will update this report with new details as they become\navailable.\n\n## What’s Known About SolarStorm and SUNBURST\n\nSolarStorm specifically targeted supply chains during their attack on SolarWinds’ Orion IT performance and statistics\nmonitoring software.\nSolarStorm is a highly skilled threat actor, with a significant operational security mindset, as can be observed in its\npost-exploitation activity.\nSolarWinds recently filed an SEC report indicating that, while they have over 300,000 customers, fewer than 18,000\ncustomers were running the trojanized version of the Orion software.\nSolarStorm threat actors created a legitimate digitally signed backdoor, SUNBURST, as a trojanized version of a\nSolarWinds Orion plug-in. The trojanized software acts as a powerful supply chain infiltration mechanism for delivery.\nSUNBURST has been observed delivering multiple payloads, mostly focused on memory-only droppers, such as the\nFireEye-dubbed TEARDROP and Cobalt Strike BEACON.\nSUNBURST’s command and control (C2) traffic masquerades as legitimate Orion Improvement Program traffic.\n[FireEye has released signatures and specific indicators to help identify SolarStorm’s activity.](https://github.com/fireeye/sunburst_countermeasures)\n\nFireEye’s research has been a cornerstone in providing not only useful signatures, but also indicators which help with\ntracking and hunting for SolarStorm activity. A synopsis of those indicators is included below.\n\n**SUNBURST**\n\nAt the time of this publication, the Windows Installer Patch file including the trojanized version of the SolarWinds Orion\nproduct was still reachable:\n\nFilename: SolarWinds-Core-v2019.4.5220-Hotfix5.msp\n\nSHA256: d0d626deb3f9484e649294a8dfa814c5568f846d5aa02d4cdad5d041a29d5600\n\nThis installer contains:\n\nLegitimate SolarWinds Orion update components.\nA digitally signed SUNBURST backdoor, and its legitimate configuration file:\n\nSHA256: 32519b85c0b422e4656de6e6c41878e95fd95026267daab4215ee59c107d6c77\n\nFilename: SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll\nCertificate SN: 0f:e9:73:75:20:22:a6:06:ad:f2:a3:6e:34:5d:c0:ed\nSHA256: efbec6863f4330dbb702cc43a85a0a7c29d79fde0f7d66eac9a3be43493cab4f\n\nFilename: SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll.config\n\nThe infrastructure related to this series of attacks includes:\n\nTrojanized update file hosted at:\n\nhxxps://downloads.solarwinds[.]com/solarwinds/CatalogResources/Core/2019.4/2019.4.5220.20574/SolarWindsCore-v2019.4.5220-Hotfix5.msp\nDGA-generated C2s as subdomains of:\n\navsvmcloud[.]com\n\n\n-----\n\nC2 domains found during SUNBURST incidents, including CNAME records, or subsequent phases of the incident,\nsuch as BEACON components:\n\nfreescanonline[.]com\ndeftsecurity[.]com\nthedoccloud[.]com\nwebsitetheme[.]com\nhighdatabase[.]com\nincomeupdate[.]com\ndatabasegalore[.]com\npanhardware[.]com\nZupertech[.]com\nVirtualdataserver[.]com\ndigitalcollege[.]org\nsolartrackingsystem[.]net\nwebcodez[.]com\nseobundlekit[.]com\nvirtualwebdata[.]com\nlcomputers[.]com\navsvmcloud[.]com\nMobilnweb[.]com\nkubecloud[.]com\n\n**TEARDROP**\n\nSUNBURST deployed several different payloads, and in at least one instance, a memory-only dropper FireEye dubbed\nTEARDROP to deploy a Cobalt Strike BEACON. During analysis of the information available, Unit 42 identified related\nactivity involving TEARDROP malware that was used to execute a customized Cobalt Strike BEACON. This sample contains\na beacon request to the previously unreported domain mobilnweb[.]com.\n\nThe TEARDROP DLL has a SHA256 of: 118189f90da3788362fe85eafa555298423e21ec37f147f3bf88c61d4cd46c51\n\nand contains a beacon request for the URI /2019/Person-With-Parnters-Brands-Our/ with the User-Agent Mozilla/5.0\n(Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/85.0.4183.83 Safari/537.36. Within\nthat same configuration, we also observed an additional URI setting containing the string /2019/This-Person-Two-JoinWith/.\n\n## Protecting Our Customers\n\nAs of the time of writing, based on signatures and observables that have been released, Palo Alto Networks customers are\nprotected across our product ecosystem, with specific protections deployed or being deployed in the following products and\nsubscriptions for the Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW). It is imperative for customers to employ the best practices for Palo\nAlto Networks products in order to ensure your appliances are configured in a manner best suited for your protection.\n\nDue to the nature of these attacks, we recommend our customers perform the following searches immediately. If you are\n[unable, Palo Alto Networks will help you locate SolarWinds Orion servers owned by your organization and assess whether](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/solarstorm-rapid-response)\nyou’ve been compromised free of charge.

These devices are being added to the IoT\nSecurity user portal UI, and the Device-ID attribute will be pushed to PAN-OS. These devices will be displayed to users as\n\"SolarWinds Network Management Device\" within the IoT Security user portal UI. In PAN-OS, users will see the Device-ID\nattribute \"Profile\" = \"SolarWinds Network Management Device\". This feature will be enabled for all IoT Security customers\nthis week.\n\nThreat Prevention and DNS Security provide protection against C2 beacons and associated traffic.
