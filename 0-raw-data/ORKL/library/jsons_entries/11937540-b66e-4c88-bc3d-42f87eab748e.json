Carbanak Group), the group continues to develop its business](https://news.softpedia.com/news/fin7-cybercrime-boss-gets-7-year-jail-sentence-533340.shtml)\nmodel and toolset throughout 2021 [3]. During the first week of June 2021, eSentire’s Threat\nResponse Unit (TRU) witnessed an opportunistic malspam campaign that was conducted by\nthe FIN7 group. The criminal group used a fake legal complaint centering around BrownForman Inc. Brown-Forman is a large, U.S.-based wine and spirits company and the maker\nof the popular Jack Daniels whisky. (Figures 1 and 2). On June 10, external researchers\nobserved a USPS mail delivery notification lure (Figure3). It was associated with the same\ninfrastructure set as the legal complaint lure. Toward the end of June, a ProofPoint\nresearcher documented a Windows 11 lure used to deliver JSSLoader.\n\nOne of the victims of the malicious legal complaint campaign was a law firm. The lure\nsuccessfully bypassed the law firm’s email filters, and it was not detected as suspicious by\nany of the firm’s employees. eSentire’s TRU team identified the malicious document through\nthreat hunting activities.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe initial stage of the malware arrives as an Excel attachment, which downloads and\nexecutes a variant of the JSSLoader Remote Access Trojan (RAT). The variant has been\nreported as being used by the FIN7 group [3]. The malicious Excel document leverages\nWindows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to install the RAT. Once installed, JSSLoader\nprovides the threat group with a backdoor to the victim’s computer and the organization.\n\n**Figure 1: Brown-Forman Lookalike Landing Page (browm-forman[.]com)**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 2: Legal Complaint lure observed by TRU on June 1, 2021 that led to an**\n**employee at a law firm downloading and executing a variant of JSSLoader.**\n\n**Figure 3: USPS lure associated with FIN7 infrastructure.**\n\n## FIN7 Objectives\n\nFIN7 is a financially motivated cybercrime group which gained notoriety for stealing millions\nof credit card numbers from businesses around the world. One security research team\n[reported that the crime group stole more than a billion dollars between 2015 and 2018 from](https://www.wired.com/story/fin7-wild-inner-workings-billion-dollar-hacking-group/)\n[companies globally. U.S. federal law officials filed court documents on June 17, 2021 stating](https://www.cyberscoop.com/fin7-hacking-phishing-sec-restaurant/)\nthat FIN7 had more than 70 members, all assigned to various departments under the larger\norganization. The court documents went on to say that the FIN7 leaders would organize their\npersonnel into different teams. These teams are tasked with creating malware, crafting\nphishing documents and collecting money from compromised victims. As for the U.S. victims,\ncourt officials stated that the group went after hundreds of U.S. companies infecting\norganizations ranging from the burrito chain Chipotle and the department store Saks Fifth\nAvenue. FIN7 is one of many cyber gangs observed participating in Magecart attacks [4].\nMagecart is a consortium of malicious hacker groups who target online shopping cart\nsystems, such as the Magento system, to steal customer payment card information.\n\n\n-----\n\nFIN7 has also been associated with the Ryuk ransomware group[5]. In December 2020,\nsecurity researchers at Trusec observed an attacker use the tools and techniques of FIN7 to\ngain a foothold into an enterprise. In a second attack against the company, almost six weeks\nlater, that same foothold was used to launch Ryuk ransomware into the victim’s environment.\nThe Truesec researchers stated that this was the first instance where they had observed a\ncombination of FIN7 tools and the RYUK ransomware. Until this incident, they said they had\nnever seen FIN7 associated with ransomware attacks. The TRU has also never observed a\nconnection between FIN7 and the Ryuk ransomware group. Truesec theorized “it was\npossible FIN7 simply sold the access to the Ryuk group, but it is probable that FIN7 and the\nRyuk gang are more closely affiliated and may be part of the same organized crime network.”\n\n[5]. No matter which theory is correct, this implies that few criminal organizations are out of\nscope for FIN7, since ransomware can often monetize intrusions regardless of the industry.\n\nSimilar conclusions can be drawn from the recent analysis on the victimology of the Avaddon\nransomware group, which demonstrates a diverse set of victim targets, across business\nsectors and revenue volumes [6]. These observations are part of a trend of modern,\nfinancially motivated attacks which implement a threat model that is effective, regardless of\nan organization’s industry. If FIN7 cannot make use of an organization they have\ncompromised, they are likely to participate in the “initial access market,” selling or trading\naccess to the victim entity with another threat actor or threat group. Those threat actors are\nlikely to be a ransomware group or its affiliates to monetize the access.\n\n## FIN7’s Malicious Spam Campaign Using a Legal Lure Involving Brown-Forman Inc.\n\nDuring this attack, the initial email arrives alleging a legal complaint for wine and spirits\ncompany, Brown-Forman, as observed by the TRU team, as well as other researchers [7].\nBrown-Forman is one of the largest American-owned spirits and wine companies and among\nthe top 10 largest global spirits companies.\n\nSeveral researchers reported this lure, indicating that this was not a single incident, but most\nlikely an opportunistic spam campaign. Corporate users might immediately suspect a\nrandom legal complaint, that arrives via email, from a large spirits and wine company.\nHowever, law firms deal with legal complaints across industry verticals regularly so the\ncontent would not be considered out of the ordinary. Thus, law firms may be more\nsusceptible to this topic.\n\n## FIN7’s Shifting Lures\n\nOn June 10, external researchers observed FIN7 using a USPS-themed email attachment[8].\nThe USPS lure is more generic and thus, more opportunistic in nature. And as mentioned\npreviously, during the last week of June, a Proofpoint researcher saw a Windows 11 lure\nwhich led to the JSSLoader.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhatever the specific intentions of FIN7, they appear to be actively adjusting their lures to\nmaximize campaign success. For example, the legal complaint lure hit Internet users’ email\ninboxes the first week of June, just one month before settlement claims were due for a class\n[action suit against Brown-Forman regarding a ransomware breach the company suffered in](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-14/brown-forman-was-target-of-apparent-ransomware-attack)\nAugust 2020 (Figure 5). The infamous REvil (Sodin) gang took credit for the ransomware\nattack. Although the company said they were able to disrupt the attack before their data\ncould be encrypted, the REvil gang broadcasted on their blog/leak site that they had access\nto Brown-Forman’s systems for over a month and stole a terabyte of their company data.\n\nThe fact that the TRU spotted FIN7 launching a malicious email campaign in June 2021,\nusing the Brown-Forman legal complaint as a lure, and it was approximately one month\nbefore claim forms were due from victims (Figure 4.) is coincidental. Whether FIN7 is\nconnected to the REvil (Sodinokibi) attack against Brown-Forman or whether they are simply\ncapitalizing on public news regarding the case remains to be seen. In further examining\npotential connections between FIN7 and REvil, in August 2020 a Swiss security company\npromised to demonstrate connections between the two threat groups in a series of blog\nposts [9] but never provided sufficient evidence. It appears that they were left waiting for\nconfirmation from the ransomware victims [10][11]. Regardless, what we do know for sure is\nthat cybercriminals use well-timed lures and try to predict the susceptibility of a theme for\ntheir threat campaigns, and they will use lures built around social trends [12], global crises\n\n[13] and routine events [14].\n\n## Operating Infrastructure Tying FIN7’s Malicious Email Lures Together\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 4: Infrastructure and malware used in the latest FIN7 campaigns**\n\nThe most recent lures associated with FIN7 show connections in their supporting\ninfrastructure. (Figure 3). The servers are observed performing three distinct functions. The\nprimary download server, observed by TRU, was browm-forman[.]com which served as a\nstarting point. First stage payloads are fetched from intermediate servers, such as\n**opposedent[.]com, jurisdictionious[.]com, halfious[.]com, pigeonious[.]com. It is**\nunclear what role fairedale[.]com plays, though given its position in redirection and\nJavaScript management, its role may be to test whether a visiting computer is a susceptible\nvictim (and not, for example, a security researcher) before redirecting the user to the\nmalicious payload. The command- and- control domains(C2s), for the first payload, appear to\nbe unitious[.]com, injuryless[.]com, deprivationant[.]com, jurisdictionient[.]com, and\n**legislationient[.]com. There is no apparent relationship with the infrastructure reported by**\nprevious research.\n\nAnother curious finding is that some infrastructure was not observed by TRU for months\nfollowing domain registration. In the incident which leveraged the Brown-Forman lure, the\nlanding page for the lookalike domain (browm-forman[.]com) was registered 2021-03-11, but\n[not observed until June. VirusTotal submissions for this domain line up with the June](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/domain/browm-forman.com/relations)\nobservations. This gap between registration and operational use might have been to thwart\nwebsite reputation filters which utilize domain age as input. This months-long time delta does\n[not appear to carry over to C2 domains used by the weaponized Excel document and](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/b8226e0691779280f1cbbcba93d41e01bc26a7ad37c88bc3b835e72c1376a7fe/detection)\n[subsequent JSSLoader payload. Both contacted domains registered May 27, a week priorth](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/822457c427a0776b41dd8f3479070e56fdd53ccd0175418d4e7d85065ec7d7d1/detection)\nto in- the-wild use.\n\n\nFinally, TRU observed registration of a new lookalike domain (brown-formam[.]com) on June\n9 . While in-the-wild use has not been observed, the registration and TLS certificate patternsth\nmatch the previous landing page. We assess this domain will replace the prior one given that\nit has been exposed publicly.\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\nThe following key takeaways have been summarized by Spence Hutchinson, Manager of\nThreat Intelligence, eSentire:\n\nDespite several key members of the FIN7 group being incarcerated, the gang\ncontinues to mount successful threat campaigns, indicating that they have numerous\nmembers and extensive recruitment efforts.\nNotably for the Brown-Forman case, FIN7 threat actors registered the infrastructure\nmonths before the TRU saw it in action. Either the attackers were using it for months\nbefore eSentire saw the activity, or they weaponized it after a period of time to evade\nemail filtering by newly registered domains. If that is the case, this shows a degree of\nplanning and sophistication on the part of FIN7.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe FIN7 group is very experienced. They have been involved in financial cybercrime\nfor a long time, and they know how to use social engineering techniques that will lure\ncomputer users. Their success in compromising companies and individuals, via email,\nreiterates the importance of continually educating one’s employees and partners to be\non the lookout for malicious email campaigns.\nFIN7’s regular shifting of infrastructure and lures is a testament to their knowledge on\nhow to evade detection by security professionals.\nIt is plausible that proficient financial cybercrime groups, such as FIN7, are providing\ninitial access to seasoned ransomware groups, such as REvil (Sodinokibi), Ryuk, etc.\nas a way to monetize their access.\n\nIf you’re not currently engaged with a Managed Detection and Response provider, we highly\nrecommend you partner with us for security services in order to disrupt threats before they\nimpact your business.\n\n[Want to learn more about how we protect legal firms globally?
